[28:20] surprise you that I'm reading out of
[28:22] Revelation chapter 1. We've been in a
[28:24] little bit of a series here on modern
[28:27] events, but um I've got a little bit of
[28:30] a of a detour off of that tonight. I'm
[28:32] not even titling it that uh tonight. And
[28:36] uh so we're just going to look to the
[28:38] Lord. And uh the title that I've chosen
[28:41] tonight is the daughter of Zion. The
[28:43] daughter of Zion. Amen. Revelation
[28:46] chapter 1 and let's start at verse we're
[28:50] going to catch verse one and then drop
[28:51] down to 4 through8.
[28:55] The revelation of Jesus Christ which God
[28:58] gave unto him to show unto his servants
[29:03] things which must shortly come to pass.
[29:06] And he sent and signified it by his
[29:09] angel unto his servant John. Verse four.
[29:15] John to the seven churches which are in
[29:17] Asia. Grace be unto you and peace from
[29:20] him which is and which was and which is
[29:22] to come. And from the seven spirits
[29:25] which are before his throne and from
[29:27] Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness
[29:30] and the first begotten of the dead and
[29:33] the prince of the kings of the earth
[29:36] unto him that loved us and washed us
[29:38] from our sins in his own blood and hath
[29:42] made I love this scripture. and hath
[29:44] made us kings and priests unto God and
[29:47] his father. To him be glory and dominion
[29:52] forever and ever. Amen. Behold, he
[29:55] cometh with clouds, and every eye shall
[29:57] see him. Now, this is not the secret
[29:59] catching away. This is not the rapture.
[30:01] This is when every eye shall see him.
[30:03] All right? when he comes back in
[30:05] Revelation 19. Um, every eye shall see
[30:09] him and they also which pierced him and
[30:11] all kindreds of the earth shall wail
[30:14] because of him. Even so, amen. I am
[30:18] Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the
[30:21] ending, saith the Lord, which is and
[30:24] which was and which is to come, the
[30:28] Almighty.
[30:29] Amen. And I'm going to invite you also
[30:32] to Jeremiah chapter 8. Um, right after
[30:36] the book of Isaiah, you're going to find
[30:37] the weeping prophet of Jeremiah. Praise
[30:40] the Lord. Jeremiah chapter 8.
[30:46] Jeremiah is quite a contrast from the
[30:48] book of Isaiah. And uh the Lord has the
[30:52] me going in this direction tonight.
[30:55] Jeremiah chapter 8 and we're going to
[30:58] catch verses 18 through 22.
[31:05] Verse 18. Jeremiah 8 verse 18. You got
[31:08] it? Say amen.
[31:11] When I would comfort myself against
[31:14] sorrow,
[31:16] my heart is faint in me.
[31:21] It's interesting the amplified version
[31:24] says, "Oh, that I could comfort
[31:27] Jeremiah, oh that I Jeremiah could
[31:29] comfort myself against sorrow, for my
[31:32] grief is beyond healing. My heart is
[31:36] sick and faint within me." You know,
[31:39] healing um has value always, but a lot
[31:45] of times you you want to think about,
[31:47] oh, if God would just do this for me, if
[31:50] God would just grant this to me, it
[31:52] might not be a physical healing. It
[31:54] might be some need that you have in your
[31:56] life. Maybe maybe you've got a
[31:59] deliverance that you need. How many
[32:02] times have you prayed that? Lord,
[32:04] deliver me. I've got a a certain
[32:05] problem, a certain weakness. I need to
[32:07] overcome it. You know, um healing is
[32:11] great, but what what if the cause is
[32:14] still there?
[32:17] See, so if God would heal you of it or
[32:19] deliver you from it, well, what if you
[32:21] haven't removed the cause of why you're
[32:24] in that problem? Say, "Oh Lord, I've got
[32:26] I've got a financial crisis. Please get
[32:29] me out of it." And the Lord could do
[32:30] that. But what if the cause remains?
[32:33] Amen. I got a problem in my marriage. I
[32:35] got problem in my between me and my
[32:37] spouse. Lord, fix uh uh come in and and
[32:40] smooth this all over. But if the problem
[32:42] is still there,
[32:45] then your deliverance is going to be
[32:47] quite temporary.
[32:49] So he says, when I would comfort myself
[32:53] against sorrow, and this is what it
[32:55] means, my heart is faint uh in me. My
[32:58] grief is beyond healing. Because the
[33:01] problem that Jeremiah was going to bring
[33:03] to Israel, he's speaking to them in uh
[33:06] you know almost in the first person as
[33:08] if it's God talking to them. And and and
[33:12] the problem is that
[33:14] you're sick
[33:16] and I can heal you, but the problem is
[33:20] there. We're going to we need to deal
[33:22] with the reason for the sickness. Now,
[33:26] that's a lot of times people don't want
[33:27] to do that. They just want a quick fix.
[33:29] Just give me a magic pill. Amen. I don't
[33:32] want to do any harder work. You know, uh
[33:34] just give me a form. Give me a rule I
[33:36] can follow. But you know, Elijah came to
[33:39] turn the hearts
[33:41] of the people. And you know, when you
[33:44] got to deal with matters of the heart,
[33:45] it's a lot harder because it takes work.
[33:47] It takes a willingness to own it. takes
[33:50] a willingness to make the adjustments
[33:51] that are necessary and to um you know
[33:55] you know because of the from the
[33:57] abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.
[34:00] So it's more it's going to take more
[34:02] than just regulating what you say
[34:04] because if the cause is still there you
[34:06] getting me? You getting me? All right.
[34:09] You starting to catch where we're headed
[34:12] and you you'll understand why I read out
[34:14] of the book of Revelation just in a
[34:15] minute. Verse 19.
[34:18] Behold the voice of the cry of the
[34:22] daughter of my people because of them
[34:26] that dwell in a far country. Is not the
[34:29] Lord in Zion?
[34:32] Is not her king in her? Why have they
[34:36] provoked me to anger with their graven
[34:38] images and with strange vanities?
[34:41] The harvest is passed, the summer's
[34:43] ended, and we are not saved. For the
[34:46] hurt of the daughter of my people am I
[34:50] hurt. I am black. Astonishment hath
[34:53] taken hold on me. Is there no bomb in
[34:56] Gilead? Is there no physician there? Why
[34:59] then is not the health of the daughter
[35:02] of my people recovered?
[35:06] Verse 22 from the amplified. Is there no
[35:08] bomb in Gilead? Is there no physician
[35:11] there? Why then is not the health of the
[35:14] daughter of my people restored? Be
[35:17] here's the answer. Because Zion no
[35:20] longer enjoyed the presence of the great
[35:23] physician.
[35:25] So when you don't enjoy the presence of
[35:28] the great physician, then it it's it's
[35:31] the question answers itself. Why? Why am
[35:34] I not healed? Why am I not delivered?
[35:36] Why am I not free? Why have I not
[35:37] overcome? Well, you know, is there you
[35:40] say, "Well, is God not present in the
[35:41] world?" Of course, he's present in the
[35:43] world, but is he present in your life on
[35:46] a daily basis? Is he present in your
[35:48] home, your family, at work, wherever you
[35:51] go? Listen, he he he doesn't Can I say
[35:55] this to you? The Lord doesn't use a
[35:57] remote control
[35:59] for his family. I use one up here.
[36:02] That's not how God runs his family. You
[36:05] know, pe the nation lives off of the
[36:07] remote. Somebody find the remote, and if
[36:09] the remote gets lost, everybody's in a
[36:10] panic. The Lord don't use a remote
[36:13] control to run his family. He lives in
[36:15] the home, in the family, and he he's
[36:18] right there to to guide everything.
[36:21] Amen.
[36:22] All right,
[36:24] let's pray.
[36:27] Father, we ask for your blessing. And
[36:30] Lord, I I I've been able to to to see
[36:35] right off the bat today and and the and
[36:38] this afternoon, Lord, looking over
[36:40] everything and throughout the day,
[36:41] pondering what I would come to. You you
[36:45] made it clear to me, Lord, even
[36:47] yesterday, the direction that we would
[36:49] go. And I've I've been thinking about
[36:51] this, Lord, but yet it's it's been
[36:54] interesting to me that you have taken it
[36:57] even in a direction that even I've been
[36:59] surprised at. So Lord, I give it to you
[37:02] completely. Now, Father, come and be
[37:05] glorified in our midst. Lord, in just a
[37:08] little bit, we'll take up prayer
[37:09] requests, but we want to have some
[37:11] lessons from your word tonight. So, help
[37:14] us, won't you? I'm sure you will commit
[37:16] it to you in Jesus name. Amen. God bless
[37:19] you, friend. You can be seated.
[37:42] You know,
[37:44] Brother Brham
[37:46] took this text in Jeremiah
[37:51] and one of the sermons that he took it
[37:54] for quite a bit was the sermon why just
[38:00] that just a three-letter word why was
[38:02] just a question and I I found it
[38:06] interesting at least it was interesting
[38:08] to me that that brother Brandham
[38:12] used this leading this leading word this
[38:17] questioning word on a number of titles
[38:21] uh he he and you'd be familiar with them
[38:23] the very first one I could find was from
[38:26] 1953.
[38:27] Why I am a holy roller. Amen. Praise the
[38:30] Lord. If you want to know why someone is
[38:33] a holy roller, ask brother Jack Guess.
[38:35] He will tell you right immediately why
[38:37] he's a holy roller. I can hear him
[38:40] shouting amen right now. Brother
[38:42] Brandham comes along in 1954.
[38:45] Why? I'm praying for the sick. 1956.
[38:50] Why are people so tossed about? And he's
[38:54] talking about believers. He's talking
[38:56] about people who go to church. See, why
[38:58] are people so tossed about? He comes in
[39:01] 1957.
[39:03] Why is it that so many Christians find
[39:06] it so hard to live the Christian life?
[39:09] Ain't that a good question? I'm going to
[39:11] make you want to go this week and go,
[39:12] "What was that title, man? I want to
[39:13] hear that."
[39:15] It's one of the first le one of the
[39:17] first sermons that struck my young heart
[39:20] back then. They called it um you know
[39:22] it's it's called now why people are so
[39:24] tossed about. When brother Brandham
[39:26] preached it they first titled it the
[39:27] innervale and I actually my mom had the
[39:30] original copy of that in our home. I
[39:32] have it today. They changed it later
[39:34] because really when you listen to it
[39:35] brother Brandham called it why people
[39:37] are so tossed about but the subject was
[39:39] the inner veil and it was about moving
[39:42] beyond just becoming a churchgoer. It
[39:45] was about becoming a third realm dweller
[39:47] more than just the outer court, you
[39:49] know, because he, Brother Brandham would
[39:51] say, if you live out there in the outer
[39:52] court, well, you're at least you're
[39:54] you're within the temple, you know,
[39:56] you're in the tabernacle grounds. I
[39:58] mean, there there there there is a, you
[40:00] know, the sacrifice and there's the
[40:02] brazen altar and and all of that. That's
[40:05] fine. Uh but brother Brandham said the
[40:07] problem with staying out there in the
[40:09] outer court is that it was great in the
[40:11] daytime but then it would become
[40:14] nighttime and then you know all you had
[40:16] was was moonlight and starlight. You
[40:19] could you didn't see as good and and and
[40:21] a lot of people brother Brandham talked
[40:23] about them being camp stars
[40:26] and he said they just live from one
[40:27] revival to the next. See it's it's fine.
[40:30] You you've met God in justification.
[40:32] That's true. But you you need to move
[40:35] into the next level which would be the
[40:37] holy place. And in there then you had
[40:39] the the manor, the seven lampstands, the
[40:42] shoebread and different things like
[40:43] that. And you say, "Well, I sure have
[40:45] improved. Now I'm living in the second
[40:47] realm. Sure enough, I'm in here uh you
[40:50] know, and I've got the the table of
[40:52] shoebre and I've got the seven golden
[40:55] lampstands." But brother Brandham said,
[40:57] 'You know, those those that lampstand
[41:00] requires maintaining because you you you
[41:03] know it can it can smoke out and those
[41:04] flames go out. You got to constantly
[41:06] check the oil, constantly refill it,
[41:10] refill it, make sure it's trimmed, make
[41:12] sure everything's right, hope you don't
[41:13] knock it over.
[41:16] But then, Brother Brandham said, "Now
[41:18] you can go beyond that badger skin into
[41:22] what the Bible calls the most holy
[41:24] place." I know we call it, you know, the
[41:26] the holy of holies. The the the King
[41:28] James actually uses the most holy place.
[41:31] And and there's where brother Brandham
[41:33] said that's where God dwells. That's
[41:34] where the shikina is. And that's where
[41:37] Aaron had a had a rod that was had long
[41:41] ago dead. It was just a rod and it got
[41:43] left in there. And when they went back
[41:45] to get it, that thing had done it had
[41:48] done grown out and and and sprouted. And
[41:51] suddenly it was not it had it had limbs
[41:54] and it had leaves and it had fruit and
[41:56] the fruit was bearing.
[41:58] I think it was almonds and and I mean
[42:01] that happened overnight. Think what God
[42:04] could do for you overnight.
[42:07] I don't care what kind of problem you
[42:08] guys say. You don't know how dead I am.
[42:10] You don't know how dead that rod was.
[42:13] That thing had not had not had life
[42:15] surging through it in many many years.
[42:18] And since since it was part of a tree
[42:20] and living in the earth and that had
[42:22] been ages before, I'm here to tell you,
[42:24] I don't care what kind of problem.
[42:25] Brother Brandham said, when you live in
[42:27] that realm, you don't have to worry
[42:29] about storms of life. You're not out
[42:31] there. You don't have to worry about
[42:32] your oil running dry. You're living in
[42:35] the presence of the shikina. If you need
[42:37] healing, he said, just reach around. The
[42:40] golden pot of mana is in there, and you
[42:42] can just take a handful out. Whatever
[42:44] you need is supplied in that third
[42:47] realm.
[42:50] So, brother Brandham, that that was his
[42:52] answer to his question. He first asked
[42:55] the question, why are people so tossed
[42:57] about?
[42:59] Why is it that so many Christians find
[43:02] it so hard to live a Christian life? And
[43:05] the answer to the question is because
[43:08] you're not spending your life in the
[43:10] third realm.
[43:13] Fair enough.
[43:15] He would go on in 57, why some people
[43:17] can't keep the victory. 1958, why are we
[43:22] not a denomination?
[43:24] Why little Bethlehem? 1959, why Christ
[43:28] speak? See, he comes into 1962, why I'm
[43:33] against organized religion. He is 63
[43:36] hits, why Christ speak again. 63, why
[43:39] little Bethlehem 64, why it had to be
[43:42] shepherds? Why? Why? Why? Why? See, so
[43:45] but but but then brother Brandham came
[43:47] first. The first time I find it is in
[43:50] 1959
[43:52] and August. Now this is about a year and
[43:55] a half in
[43:57] to America turning the gospel down for
[44:01] the last time.
[44:03] That happened at the end of 1956 and now
[44:07] they're in 19 uh and so 1957. So
[44:11] actually you'd have all of 57 and and
[44:13] then you'd have uh you know part of the
[44:15] way through 1958 little little more than
[44:18] a year and a half deep
[44:21] and and brother Brandham comes to the
[44:23] pull pit in Shiakwa Ohio and for the
[44:27] first time he just he just shortens it.
[44:29] I'm just going to preach a sermon called
[44:31] why.
[44:33] That's it. Why? and he he's going to
[44:36] take a different angle and he's going to
[44:38] begin to say, you know, think about all
[44:41] that God has did for the world. He sent
[44:44] his son to die and then he sent the Holy
[44:46] Ghost into the church and then he he
[44:49] sent seven angels, seven earthly
[44:52] messengers, seven stars in his right
[44:54] hand through seven church ages and he's
[44:56] come down to the end and he's restored
[44:58] and now he's got a restoration uh going
[45:00] on and he's brought back the Holy Ghost.
[45:02] And this is even 1959 and brother
[45:04] Brandham is still in those still still
[45:06] in that talking about that Isuza revival
[45:09] that that re what's the real baptism of
[45:11] the Holy Ghost. See and so he's saying
[45:14] and he's got his preachers and and and
[45:16] and and what happened in Durban and what
[45:19] happened in in you know in South Africa
[45:21] in Durban South Africa and what happened
[45:23] in India and what happened in all kinds
[45:25] of places and and and the nation is
[45:28] worse off. the world is worse off. And
[45:31] he says, "The church is sick. It can't
[45:35] even go in the rapture. It can't even
[45:38] improve." And he says, "God has a
[45:41] right." Now, I want you to think about
[45:43] this. A prophet is identifying that God
[45:47] has a right,
[45:49] having given so much, he has a right to
[45:53] ask why.
[45:55] Why is the church sick? Why is the world
[45:59] run over in sin? Why has America
[46:02] rejected the gospel?
[46:05] He goes on and preaches it in August 59.
[46:10] He goes again in 59 and September, March
[46:14] of 60, April of 60, November of 60,
[46:18] January of 61, later in January of 61,
[46:22] later still in January of 60 or April of
[46:25] 61. 1962 in June 1963 in June and and
[46:31] and and when he comes to this 1963
[46:35] now he's in June 63 and this is after
[46:38] the opening of the seals
[46:42] and now you've got the the most epic
[46:45] moment the thing that the church has
[46:47] waited for since it fell away since the
[46:50] since the revelation of Jesus Christ was
[46:53] sealed up under seven seals. And now
[46:56] it's finally open. And did Pentecost
[46:59] accept it? No way.
[47:02] No way. And they would end up crucifying
[47:05] the word of God. Aresh. They would they
[47:07] would become an indicted generation.
[47:10] They would put Christ out. You know,
[47:12] it's interesting because when we read,
[47:16] you know, Revelation chapter 1 and verse
[47:19] 8,
[47:20] you know, you it's hard to read those
[47:23] first eight verses of the book of
[47:26] Revelation, all of it really, but
[47:28] particularly those first eight verses,
[47:31] because you're you're reading in such
[47:33] descriptive ways. I don't see how anyone
[47:37] can read those first eight verses and
[47:40] second guessess who Jesus is. that he's
[47:41] some second person in the godhead. I
[47:43] don't get it. I don't see how that he
[47:46] can constantly say, "I'm the beginning
[47:48] and the ending and the first and the
[47:49] last and the alpha and the omega. I I'm
[47:51] I'm I'm all of it. I'm everything in
[47:53] between." And and and you know, and then
[47:56] the world can still come away. But you
[47:58] but you know, here's here's something to
[48:00] to be noticed in the eth verse
[48:04] is uh give me that again, brother Josh.
[48:06] Are you the one uh giving me the
[48:07] scripture? Amen. Yeah. Give me give me
[48:10] Revelation 18. Amen. Let's look at that
[48:13] again. I just want to just want to
[48:14] refresh your memory. In Revelation 18,
[48:17] he says, "I am Alpha and Omega, the
[48:21] beginning and the ending, sayeth the
[48:22] Lord, which is and which was and which
[48:24] is to come, the Almighty." So, who is
[48:26] he? If he's not the Almighty, I mean, if
[48:29] he's the Almighty, then who do you say
[48:31] this is? I think that there's no
[48:34] question who this is talking about. The
[48:37] Alpha, the Omega, the Almighty. Is it
[48:40] anyone besides the Almighty? Is there
[48:43] another Almighty besides the Almighty?
[48:46] But you see, here's something to
[48:48] understand. I remember brother Lonnie
[48:49] used to always note this that if you'll
[48:52] notice that when Jesus
[48:55] came in his earthly pilgrimage, this is
[48:58] something that's noticeable. when Jesus
[49:01] came in his earthly pilgrimage. Now,
[49:03] back in the Gospels before the book of
[49:05] Revelation comes on the scene, back in
[49:08] the record of his earthly pilgrimage,
[49:11] you'll notice that that what's being
[49:14] said in Revelation chapter 1 has a
[49:17] different uh uh a different approach and
[49:20] a different aim than what the gospels
[49:22] have. Because when he when the gospels
[49:25] record the life of Jesus of Nazareth,
[49:28] Jesus doesn't isn't really there to
[49:32] glorify himself. He's there to glorify
[49:35] the father. He says that over and over.
[49:37] I came not to do my own will, but the
[49:40] will of him that sent me. See, the son
[49:42] doeth nothing, but what he seeth the
[49:44] father do, that doeth the son likewise.
[49:46] Herein is the father glorified. See, and
[49:49] so everything that Jesus did in his
[49:52] earthly pilgrimage was not to bring
[49:55] glory to himself, but to bring glory to
[49:58] the father. See that there and there's
[50:00] where that that lady, you know, brother
[50:03] Brandham in that message why there in
[50:04] 1963 after the seals are open, there's
[50:07] where he tells the story uh one of the
[50:09] places where the woman come said, you
[50:11] know, he was just a man. And and and
[50:13] brother Brandham said, "Well, I'll admit
[50:15] he was a human." She said, 'N no, but he
[50:17] was only a man.' He said, 'N no. He
[50:19] said, I'll admit he was a human. He
[50:22] said, 'But he was more than a man. He
[50:23] was a divine man.' She said, 'Oh, no,
[50:26] because he cried. And then, you
[50:28] remember, Brother Brandham said, "That's
[50:29] thinner than the uh than the broth made
[50:32] from the shadow of a chicken that
[50:33] starved to death." So he said, and he
[50:36] actually said to her, which I wouldn't
[50:38] want to have a prophet say it to me, but
[50:39] he said it to her, "You know better than
[50:41] that.
[50:43] I mean, that would scare me to death
[50:45] because I'm thinking, I've got this man
[50:47] fooled. But you don't fool a prophet.
[50:48] You know, Satan thought he had his
[50:50] intentions hit until Isaiah outed him to
[50:53] the whole world. No, no, no. You said in
[50:54] your heart, I will I want to ascend. I
[50:56] want to be like the stars of heaven.
[50:59] See? So, so brother Brandham said to
[51:01] her, "Lady, you know better than that."
[51:03] Said, "It's true. knew he was a man when
[51:05] he wept at the tomb of Lazarus. But when
[51:08] he pulled back his little shoulders and
[51:09] called him from the grave and been dead
[51:11] four days, he said that's more than a
[51:13] man. That that's a divine man. That's a
[51:16] man plus that's the God man. He would
[51:18] later call him.
[51:21] So, so but now when he comes into the
[51:23] book into the book of revelation, now
[51:25] you understand that this is that that
[51:29] this is the this is the his revelation
[51:32] to the seven churches. And he's now
[51:36] making it very clear because he's
[51:38] actually not drawing attention to the
[51:41] father. He's drawing attention to
[51:43] himself. I am the alpha and the omega. I
[51:46] am the almighty. You don't hear him
[51:48] saying things like that in his earthly
[51:50] ministry. But now he's making it clear
[51:53] that when the when he the Holy Ghost has
[51:56] come, seven churches, you're listening,
[51:58] seven churches, now you're going to
[52:01] understand that that it's you who are
[52:04] going to be human beings full of his
[52:05] life. And you're going to glorify the
[52:07] father like I glorified the father. And
[52:10] now I'm going to bring that revelation
[52:12] that I had. I'm going to give it to you
[52:14] and you're going to glorify the father.
[52:19] So this is what made the question all
[52:22] the more serious. Why is the daughter
[52:28] of my people? Why is the daughter of
[52:31] Zion sick? See, and he says God had a
[52:35] right to ask why. Now,
[52:40] I want you to
[52:42] in our in our in our and when we read
[52:45] Jeremiah
[52:47] uh 8,
[52:49] is there no bomb in Gilead?
[52:52] Is there no physician there?
[52:55] Why then is not the health of the
[52:57] daughter of my people recovered? I I I I
[53:00] I want you to hear the sadness
[53:04] and the bewilderment in the attitude of
[53:07] God and his question.
[53:11] This is not
[53:14] uh some arrogant king, some human
[53:18] monarch down through the ages who who
[53:22] who were so arrogant that they they just
[53:25] felt like they they had the power of
[53:27] life and death. and anybody that even
[53:29] dared at all, they just they just have
[53:31] them executed on on the spot. And
[53:32] brother Brandham said, "Those great
[53:34] kings and those great pharaohs," and
[53:36] it's true. He said they thought they
[53:38] were so great, they sit in their palaces
[53:40] and on their big thrones. And I've I've
[53:42] stood there. I've went through some of
[53:44] the jungle areas of India and saw some
[53:46] of those, you know, those those great uh
[53:49] palaces and and it was and you can tell
[53:52] at one time it had been something
[53:54] amazing and now it's just a ruin. And
[53:57] brother Brandham said some of them
[53:58] pharaohs and different things like that.
[54:00] And he said they they lived in great
[54:02] opulence and and lived and had power
[54:04] over life and death and slaughtered
[54:06] people at wholesale just whenever they
[54:07] took a notion. And he says and today he
[54:11] said you'd have to dig down into the
[54:13] earth to even find where they stood.
[54:17] And they thought that they were so great
[54:19] and so high and mighty and so omnipotent
[54:22] and as if they could keep the breath in
[54:24] their own lungs. None of us can.
[54:27] And but now when you read Jeremiah
[54:30] chapter 8, you're not hearing an
[54:32] arrogant king. You're not hearing, you
[54:35] know, uh an arrogant king who thinks
[54:38] more highly of himself than he should.
[54:40] This is not this is not the anger
[54:44] a and the resentment of a of a jilted
[54:46] lover.
[54:50] This is a father
[54:52] weeping over his daughter.
[54:56] This is Zion. Not just daughters, but
[54:59] Zion represents the whole kingdom of
[55:02] God. This is a broken heart
[55:06] that is calling to those that he loves
[55:09] still even in even in their disregard
[55:12] for him. Because that's what's happening
[55:14] in Jeremiah 8. Even in their disregard
[55:17] for him. Does it sound familiar like the
[55:19] world we have today?
[55:22] Even in their disregard for him, he
[55:24] still loves them.
[55:28] And brother Brandham said he has a right
[55:31] to ask why.
[55:34] I I just got swept away thinking about
[55:38] some of the things Brother Brandham
[55:39] talked about. I mean, you know, you know
[55:41] when he comes in 1963 after the seals
[55:44] and he preaches it there in June of
[55:47] 1963, you know where he is? He's back on
[55:51] the old campground in Arkansas.
[55:54] He's back there from Brother Brandham's
[55:56] early days, way back when brother
[55:58] Brandham started his ministry out there.
[56:00] And remember, he said, "There's no finer
[56:01] people under them blue shirts than old
[56:03] Arkansas people." And he starts
[56:05] reminiscing about those early days and
[56:07] those early meetings. Those are the days
[56:09] when, you know, when when whole
[56:11] hospitals were being emptied out.
[56:14] Those are the days when when when
[56:16] brother Brandham would be called to an
[56:18] ambulance outside and he would go to the
[56:20] ambulance and there'd be a whole row of
[56:22] ambulances and the ambulances would have
[56:24] dead people in them and he would just go
[56:25] down and start raising the dead. Now,
[56:28] that's not a William Brandham story.
[56:30] That's I have sourced material that
[56:32] testifies to that
[56:35] source material that testifies to those
[56:37] things that those things really happened
[56:40] that the dead were raised and there was
[56:42] a there was a famous polio case there
[56:43] that they were noted uh there. You can
[56:46] read um a man sent from God by Gordon
[56:49] Lindseay. He testifies to all of those
[56:50] things and he testifies in his book that
[56:53] there's a host of infallible proofs. No
[56:55] one can even doubt what we're saying
[56:57] because it can be so easily proven. That
[56:59] was true back in the 1950s.
[57:03] Witnesses die, critics rise, people fall
[57:06] away,
[57:07] you know, and so so you find that that
[57:11] these are the times when he would stand
[57:13] in the pull pit for days
[57:16] and and the and the prayer line would go
[57:19] out the building and down the block and
[57:20] people were coming through. This is even
[57:23] the time when brother Brandon would
[57:24] later admit, you know, I kind of handled
[57:26] it wrong because he wouldn't let anybody
[57:28] pass by without getting healed. He said,
[57:30] "Because I knew the the promise he had
[57:32] made me, nothing will stand before your
[57:34] prayers. And if a devil tried to resist,
[57:36] he said, I would I would just stop the
[57:38] line, hold it right here. They've got a
[57:39] resistant devil." And he would stay with
[57:41] it until that devil, everybody that came
[57:43] through was getting healed. Incurable
[57:45] diseases. And finally, the Lord told
[57:47] him, said, "You know, you're you're not
[57:49] doing that right." Well, how so? Well,
[57:51] even Jesus in his earthly ministry
[57:53] didn't do it like that. What did he do?
[57:55] He only did what the father showed him.
[57:56] Brother said, "Okay, I learned
[57:58] something." He said, "I made up my mind.
[58:00] I'll pray for everybody, but I'll let
[58:02] the Lord Jesus decide who he's going to
[58:04] heal."
[58:06] But but you know, this is where they're
[58:08] lined up and he he prays and stays in
[58:10] the pull pit for hours at a time. And
[58:12] finally, you know, he would it would
[58:14] stop, everything would pause. They'd
[58:16] bring him a sandwich and a glass of milk
[58:18] and he would eat it and he would sit
[58:19] down and lean against the pull pit and
[58:21] doze off for a little catnap and then he
[58:23] would wake back up and start praying for
[58:25] people again. These are real. This
[58:26] really happened in this country. Now
[58:30] here, brother Brandon boy is all the way
[58:32] back of the at the Arkansas campground
[58:34] where it all began. And he's taking the
[58:37] message, why? How have we gotten here
[58:40] after everything that he's done? and you
[58:42] know it and it's fallible proofs. And
[58:44] since those days, brother Brandham said,
[58:46] it's now been seven times around the
[58:48] world.
[58:50] So why is the daughter of my people not
[58:54] recovered? Why is the church in the
[58:56] sickened condition that it is? Why can
[58:58] people not live an overcoming life? And
[59:01] it was a fair question.
[59:05] And God is speaking through
[59:08] Jeremiah, you know, in such um a a heavy
[59:12] way, you know, as if as if to say, you
[59:17] know, I I sent my servants to you.
[59:23] I mean, when I think about sometimes I
[59:25] see people,
[59:28] they take positions and they do certain
[59:30] things and if I if given the
[59:32] opportunity, which isn't often, but when
[59:34] I'm given it, I always try to steer the
[59:37] conversation. And there's a lot of
[59:38] people I would like to talk to and just
[59:40] say, "Look, concerning the decision you
[59:42] made, okay, I get it. You're a free
[59:44] moral agent. You're going to you're
[59:46] going to do that, but I just I just
[59:49] don't know how you're going how are you
[59:51] going to explain that to God on the day
[59:54] of judgment? What will you say?
[59:57] How are you going to I wouldn't want to
[59:59] be you. You go ahead, do what you're
[1:00:02] going to do, but I just don't know. I'd
[1:00:04] be terrified because you're going to
[1:00:06] have to face him. What are you going to
[1:00:09] say? And and you know, oh, you know, you
[1:00:13] you you we live a carnal life. If we
[1:00:15] never live an overcomer, we're not very
[1:00:17] spiritual.
[1:00:19] Amen.
[1:00:20] Is this all right for a Wednesday?
[1:00:23] Don't forget Revelation 18. He's now
[1:00:27] here to get glory through you.
[1:00:30] Hallelujah, friends. He's here to get
[1:00:32] glory to God through you. Not glorify
[1:00:35] yourself. Jesus didn't glorify himself
[1:00:37] in his earthly ministry. He glorified
[1:00:39] the father. Now in revelation he's
[1:00:41] bringing glory to himself and he's
[1:00:43] saying now this spirit is poured into
[1:00:44] the church now you go forward and
[1:00:47] glorify the father
[1:00:51] and so so we find that you know God is
[1:00:54] saying to the world brother Brandham
[1:00:56] says he has the right to ask the
[1:00:58] question why Jeremiah
[1:01:01] is asking Jeremiah has been taken over
[1:01:03] as prophets do and God is now remember
[1:01:07] holy men of old wrote as they were moved
[1:01:09] by by the Holy Spirit. That's why this
[1:01:12] is all the breathed word of God. This is
[1:01:15] not contrary to what some people say the
[1:01:18] opinions uh of men.
[1:01:21] It was not written by men. Holy men of
[1:01:24] old were moved on by the spirit of God.
[1:01:27] And Jeremiah is saying to to Zion,
[1:01:30] Jeremiah is saying to his chosen people,
[1:01:33] why are you why are you not recovered?
[1:01:35] Why are you not an overcomer? I sent my
[1:01:38] servants to you.
[1:01:42] I described
[1:01:43] what they would be like and what would
[1:01:46] follow their ministry.
[1:01:50] Sound familiar today?
[1:01:53] I even I even tailored each of my seven
[1:01:57] stars that were in my right hand when I
[1:02:01] sent them. I tailored them specifically
[1:02:03] to the age I sent them in. And I made it
[1:02:07] clear by supernatural vindication who
[1:02:10] they were. Why didn't you follow them?
[1:02:16] He he has a right to ask the question
[1:02:18] today. He would have the right to ask
[1:02:20] you and I possibly tonight. God forbid
[1:02:23] that this would be a question I would
[1:02:24] have to answer when he would say to you
[1:02:26] Zion, you bride, why? This is what he
[1:02:30] was saying to Israel, why have you
[1:02:32] accepted a watered down version of the
[1:02:34] gospel?
[1:02:36] Just because the world went to easy
[1:02:38] belieism, why did you do that?
[1:02:44] Why
[1:02:45] did you do that?
[1:02:48] You know, I I hope tonight you can hear
[1:02:51] the voice of God speaking through your
[1:02:53] through your pastor. Why would you do
[1:02:56] that? Why would you accept a watered
[1:02:59] down version of the gospel? a a watered
[1:03:01] down version of this message that just
[1:03:03] tells you you can just be, you know,
[1:03:05] just skip along in life and it doesn't
[1:03:07] really matter all that much. It matters.
[1:03:11] It matters. He tailored the messenger to
[1:03:14] the age. He He sent his servants. He
[1:03:16] sent supernatural vindication. He went
[1:03:18] to all that trouble and had all of that
[1:03:21] vindication and ran it around the world
[1:03:23] so that we could just go, "Well, it's
[1:03:25] all not all that important."
[1:03:30] Why did you do that? Especially given
[1:03:33] that I warned you to never do that. That
[1:03:36] whoever wouldn't believe that whoever
[1:03:39] wouldn't believe the servants that I
[1:03:41] sent would perish. I warned you of that.
[1:03:43] I hope America, you know, if I if I
[1:03:46] could have a microphone that would reach
[1:03:48] all to this nation, this great nation
[1:03:50] that God sent the greatest message since
[1:03:52] the days of the early church.
[1:03:55] Why did you Why did you let somebody
[1:03:57] compromise it to you? Why would we do
[1:04:00] that as believers, friend? Oh, come on.
[1:04:02] God forbid that we would do that. Say,
[1:04:04] "No, not me. Let the world go on, but
[1:04:06] I'm going to take my way with the Lord's
[1:04:08] despised few."
[1:04:13] Especially given that God warned us
[1:04:15] about it.
[1:04:16] And he's saying to Israel, he's saying
[1:04:18] to the world, he's saying to this
[1:04:20] nation, there were at times, yeah, there
[1:04:23] were there there are certain passages in
[1:04:26] the in the word that are written
[1:04:28] mysteriously. They're sealed up uh tight
[1:04:31] to human understanding. That's that's
[1:04:33] true. But but hey, I was I was still
[1:04:37] careful to make it clear enough that
[1:04:39] even a child could see it.
[1:04:45] Oh my
[1:04:50] there was certainly certainly friends we
[1:04:53] can we can talk about the seven sealed
[1:04:56] mystery and the revelation and takes the
[1:04:59] spirit and I've been preaching on that
[1:05:01] it takes the spirit to reveal it but I'm
[1:05:03] going to tell you something there's
[1:05:04] enough out there uh that's clear to us
[1:05:07] there there is certainly a sufficient
[1:05:09] amount of the word written in clear
[1:05:11] enough terms Listen, if for nothing
[1:05:13] else, let me just say this. There's a
[1:05:16] sufficient amount of revelation in this
[1:05:18] word to lead you to the Holy Ghost and
[1:05:22] and he would take it from there and
[1:05:24] carry you on the way. So where's your
[1:05:26] excuse?
[1:05:28] See, so the world will have no excuse.
[1:05:31] People who sit in churches will have no
[1:05:33] excuse because at the very least, he
[1:05:36] told us how to get to the Holy Ghost.
[1:05:38] All you got to do is read it, repent,
[1:05:40] and be baptized and really repent and
[1:05:42] really mean it. And the Holy Ghost will
[1:05:44] come upon you. And once that happens,
[1:05:46] then he'll lead you and guide you to all
[1:05:48] truth. You ain't got nothing to figure
[1:05:49] out. So that God has a right to ask
[1:05:53] through his prophet then and through his
[1:05:54] prophet now and through this pastor
[1:05:57] tonight, why?
[1:06:00] Why are you bound yet still? Why are you
[1:06:04] hindered yet still? Why is it so hard to
[1:06:07] live an overcomer's life?
[1:06:12] The Holy Ghost will take you all the way
[1:06:13] if you give him
[1:06:16] control.
[1:06:19] But he's saying to Israel, "But you
[1:06:20] wouldn't come to me, daughter, child, my
[1:06:23] child. You wouldn't come to me to
[1:06:26] receive life. I and and I warned you
[1:06:30] that you would have to.
[1:06:32] No man can come to the father but by me.
[1:06:35] I warned you. I sent a prophet to warn
[1:06:38] you that you would have to have the
[1:06:40] token and it would have to be on display
[1:06:44] for you to avoid the
[1:06:47] consequence of the death angel.
[1:06:51] So God has a right to ask why. People
[1:06:54] talk about freedom and I I want the
[1:06:56] right to choose. Can I just say
[1:06:57] something to you tonight, friends? And I
[1:06:59] just want to say it the way that that I
[1:07:01] felt inspired. God did not design a
[1:07:04] kingdom of freethinkers.
[1:07:09] He designed a kingdom rather of
[1:07:11] like-minded saints.
[1:07:14] Who are willing to say amen to his word.
[1:07:18] This isn't about being a freethinker.
[1:07:20] Resist Leodysa.
[1:07:22] Leodysa has people's rights. Leodysia
[1:07:25] wants its way. Leodysa doesn't want to
[1:07:27] be told what to do. Resist that. That's
[1:07:30] a spirit. It's a spirit of blindness
[1:07:34] that's upon the age. And brother
[1:07:35] Brandham said that was the most pitiful
[1:07:37] thing. It it's you know it's he said you
[1:07:40] they're they're naked, they're poor,
[1:07:43] they're miserable. And brother Brandham
[1:07:45] said, you know, those are all bad
[1:07:46] enough. I mean to be naked, poor, and
[1:07:48] miserable. But brother Brandham said the
[1:07:50] real thing that made it heartbreaking to
[1:07:52] him, not not angry, but it broke his
[1:07:54] heart is he said they're blind and they
[1:07:57] don't see it. You can't tell them. And
[1:07:59] if you try to tell them they they don't
[1:08:01] believe it.
[1:08:04] But the world is like it has been in
[1:08:07] every age when the when Moses stood
[1:08:10] there and said, "Choose you this day
[1:08:12] whom you will serve."
[1:08:15] And if and you know Elijah stood there,
[1:08:18] choose. If Baal be God, then serve him.
[1:08:22] But if God be God, then serve him. You
[1:08:24] got to you got to choose one or the
[1:08:26] other. You can't you remember what we've
[1:08:28] been preaching about those two altars.
[1:08:29] And I'm I don't want to get it back into
[1:08:31] that material tonight, but you remember
[1:08:33] that this is why and I think maybe I've
[1:08:36] said this, if I haven't, I'll say it
[1:08:37] tonight that that any study of the
[1:08:42] prophecy. If we're going to be studying
[1:08:46] modern events made clear in prophecy,
[1:08:49] it has to start at that first church
[1:08:52] service in Genesis 4. Remember that.
[1:08:54] Remember I said it's not a political
[1:08:56] rally. It wasn't a tech show. It wasn't
[1:08:59] it wasn't anything like that. It was a
[1:09:00] church service. They're coming to
[1:09:02] worship. And you have to show the
[1:09:04] difference between those two altars.
[1:09:06] There were very different choices being
[1:09:08] made. And the outcome was going to be
[1:09:11] based on the choices they made. You
[1:09:13] can't choose things that are contrary to
[1:09:15] God's word and keep choosing them and
[1:09:17] expect to not get sick. You can't expect
[1:09:20] that you'll stay well or that you'll
[1:09:22] stay an overcomer. Moses said, "Choose
[1:09:24] you this day whom you'll serve." And you
[1:09:27] know what? When he said that, he warned
[1:09:30] even he warned the families of Dayan and
[1:09:32] Cor. He said, "Move away. Get away.
[1:09:36] God's about to do something. Don't don't
[1:09:38] be standing near that." But you know,
[1:09:40] the Bible talks about that all the they
[1:09:42] all came out and stood in their tent
[1:09:44] door defiantly and they even gathered
[1:09:46] their families around them. Huh? What
[1:09:48] are you going to do about it, Moses?
[1:09:50] Moses wasn't going to do anything.
[1:09:53] God opened the earth and swallowed them.
[1:09:57] Dads and moms, kids, cattle, tents,
[1:10:02] homes, possessions, everything. And the
[1:10:05] earth swallowed them.
[1:10:08] Don't think the earth's not alive. It
[1:10:11] swallowed them.
[1:10:14] I want to say to you something friends
[1:10:16] that
[1:10:19] this this world is falling apart and
[1:10:24] it's calling more and more in the day
[1:10:27] and hour that you and I live in. I know
[1:10:30] it. I'm trying to convince you of it. I
[1:10:32] believe you believe it already. But let
[1:10:35] me just stir you up by way of
[1:10:36] remembrance. You need to choose God's
[1:10:39] word. You need to have a fresh choosing.
[1:10:42] Let it be in this service tonight. Say,
[1:10:44] "I'm going to make a fresh choosing. I'm
[1:10:46] not going to go down with this world.
[1:10:48] It's falling apart and I'm not going
[1:10:50] down. I'm planning to go up."
[1:10:53] But you'll never go up unless you first
[1:10:55] come out. To hear come up, you got to
[1:10:57] hear come out.
[1:10:58] And I just say, "Lord God, let me come
[1:11:00] out away from the world." And and if you
[1:11:02] got friends or acquaintances or careers
[1:11:04] or jobs or schools or investments or
[1:11:07] whatever you got and it is going to take
[1:11:09] you down, then get rid of it. God will
[1:11:11] give you more
[1:11:13] and you'll do you'll do a lot better
[1:11:15] with God's friends than you would
[1:11:17] choosing your own. You'll do better with
[1:11:20] what let God decide what things you
[1:11:23] should be involved in and what direction
[1:11:25] you should go in your life. And then
[1:11:27] then when things happen, you can turn to
[1:11:28] God and say, "Lord, I have obeyed your
[1:11:31] word. Here's the enemy, but I've been
[1:11:33] I'm in the line of duty. And I'm here to
[1:11:35] tell you something, friends. All heaven
[1:11:37] and earth will back you. and your
[1:11:39] prayers will be effectual and effective
[1:11:42] on moving devils out of the way.
[1:11:47] I mean, you know, freethinkers, no, I
[1:11:51] mean, even even our example, even our
[1:11:54] high priest, the Lord Jesus said, "I
[1:11:56] come not to do my own will.
[1:11:59] It is written in the volume of the books
[1:12:02] concerning me, a body hast thou prepared
[1:12:06] me. And sacrifices and offerings thou
[1:12:08] wouldest not, but a body hast thou
[1:12:10] prepared me. I have come to do thy will,
[1:12:14] oh Lord. Jesus had his own human will.
[1:12:17] He didn't want to die. He said, "If it's
[1:12:19] possible, let it pass." Brother M said
[1:12:21] he didn't want to die. He was young. He
[1:12:22] had his brother. He loved life. He loved
[1:12:23] them.
[1:12:25] But he says, "Not my will, thy will be
[1:12:29] done." See, so this is why Revelation 18
[1:12:33] is so important.
[1:12:35] So self-will and self-determination.
[1:12:38] Listen friends, self-will
[1:12:40] and self-determination.
[1:12:43] My goodness, that was the battlecry of
[1:12:45] Lucifer in heaven.
[1:12:48] That was what Lucifer rallied the
[1:12:50] angels, the fallen angels around him.
[1:12:53] Come on. We're going to we're not going
[1:12:54] to we're not going to be told what to
[1:12:55] do. We're going to take over this place.
[1:12:58] We're going to have our own way of doing
[1:13:00] things. And that did not end well for
[1:13:02] him. It's still not ending well. It
[1:13:04] won't end well for you and I.
[1:13:08] Oh, you know, I get it. I I I I totally
[1:13:12] get it. You know, Brother Brandham in
[1:13:15] that message, why I thought to myself,
[1:13:18] wow. Brother Random says, you know, he
[1:13:20] starts talking about those old those old
[1:13:23] things that happened back there. And he
[1:13:24] said, 'Now, what if tonight, he said,
[1:13:26] 'What if tonight we could have an Acts 4
[1:13:30] kind of meeting? And he said, you
[1:13:32] remember in Acts 4 that it the Holy
[1:13:34] Spirit came in again and shook the
[1:13:36] building. Wouldn't that be amazing? I
[1:13:38] mean, come on. It might scare us a
[1:13:40] little bit and raise the hair on the
[1:13:41] back of our neck, but if the building
[1:13:43] started shaking under the power of God,
[1:13:44] at the end of the day, we would love it.
[1:13:48] Amen.
[1:13:49] But brother Brennham in his prayer, he
[1:13:51] says, "But Lord, before you can shake
[1:13:53] the building, maybe you need to shake
[1:13:55] us.
[1:13:56] Maybe you need a shaking. Maybe our
[1:13:58] hearts need a shaking." I think if we'd
[1:14:01] have an oldfashioned shaking, then we'd
[1:14:02] see a building shaking.
[1:14:04] God's not interested in entertaining us,
[1:14:06] friends. He's not here to shake a
[1:14:07] building so we can all roll around and
[1:14:09] and and and have all kinds of emotions.
[1:14:12] That's fine. Run all over the building.
[1:14:14] I grew up in a church where they ran the
[1:14:16] ran the pews. That's fine. I never tried
[1:14:18] it. But I've seen it done. I've seen it
[1:14:21] not succeed.
[1:14:26] But that's not the point. I just want to
[1:14:28] say, Lord, yeah, I'd like to see the
[1:14:30] supernatural, but could it start here?
[1:14:33] How many would tonight say, Lord, could
[1:14:34] it just start here? Could the
[1:14:36] supernatural shaking start in me? I
[1:14:39] don't want to be wondering why I can't
[1:14:40] overcome, why I'm not healed, why do I
[1:14:42] not have my needs met. Oh, friends, God
[1:14:46] is asking the question tonight, why is
[1:14:48] the daughter of my people not recovered?
[1:14:51] Is there no bomb in Gilead?
[1:14:55] I don't know. You know, I thought to
[1:14:56] myself tonight as I was studying this
[1:14:57] this afternoon, I thought, my goodness,
[1:14:59] the people are going to say, "Brother
[1:15:01] Jason, you know what happened? You were
[1:15:04] you were going so nicely. You were
[1:15:05] preaching about modern events made
[1:15:07] clear. Can we please get back to
[1:15:08] prophecy teaching tonight? But hey,
[1:15:11] fair, you know, I I'm being fair about
[1:15:13] it because I I I told you Sunday, you
[1:15:17] are the modern event to be made clear in
[1:15:20] prophecy.
[1:15:22] So So what if we understand who the this
[1:15:24] horse rider was or who the fourth power
[1:15:26] was or what Daniel saw? That's all just
[1:15:28] history. That's all on the books. I can
[1:15:30] we can stand here tonight and talk
[1:15:32] about, you know, how the trumpets and
[1:15:34] woes and we're going to show you some of
[1:15:36] that. We're going to show you how God's
[1:15:37] word has always come to pass. I'm only
[1:15:39] showing you that to build your
[1:15:40] confidence that this is always true.
[1:15:43] It's not to wow you. It's just to build
[1:15:45] your confidence in this. But I'm here to
[1:15:47] tell you something, friends. God has
[1:15:48] already done enough for us. We are to
[1:15:50] have perfect confidence in him tonight.
[1:15:54] Amen. I believe that
[1:15:57] God sent messengers. You know, I mean,
[1:16:00] when I when I think about how that that
[1:16:03] what a what a con what a perfect
[1:16:06] biblical type is the widow of Zerapath
[1:16:11] who was caught in a great famine. And
[1:16:14] you know who came to her? Elijah.
[1:16:17] And you say, well, yeah, that was then,
[1:16:19] but this is now. Well, the Bible, I'm
[1:16:21] not even going to bother going into it
[1:16:23] tonight, but the Bible prophesies
[1:16:25] concerning the end time. You know what
[1:16:26] the one of the prophecies of the end
[1:16:28] time? You want a modern event made clear
[1:16:29] in prophecy? At the end time there will
[1:16:32] be a famine for hearing the word of God.
[1:16:35] And the world just like the widow of
[1:16:37] Zerapath and all of of of of of
[1:16:41] all of that area and they were starving
[1:16:44] and it was drought and it was famine and
[1:16:46] it was horrible conditions. But and and
[1:16:48] but Elijah was sent to her and Elijah
[1:16:51] has been sent to you and I. And you know
[1:16:54] when he when he stood there and said,
[1:16:56] you know, bring bring this and bring
[1:16:57] that and bring that. And she testified
[1:17:00] there's no ambiguity. She said, "I'm no
[1:17:02] different than anybody. I'm I'm I'm
[1:17:04] going to die. I've got just enough. Me
[1:17:06] and my child are going to eat it. We're
[1:17:08] going to die." But Elijah said, "Can you
[1:17:11] imagine how heartless that must have
[1:17:14] sounded by Elijah to say, that's fine,
[1:17:17] but bring me something first."
[1:17:20] And the only thing that she had, if she
[1:17:23] brings it to him first, she has nothing.
[1:17:26] Listen, friends, your choices are this.
[1:17:28] Hear the word of Elijah. And he's saying
[1:17:30] to you tonight, serve God first. Put
[1:17:33] Christ first. Let him be the first in
[1:17:35] your home. Let him be the first on your
[1:17:37] job, in your career, in in your
[1:17:40] associates, in your finances. Put him
[1:17:42] first. And if you do, your meal barrel
[1:17:45] will never run out and your cruise of
[1:17:47] oil. The whole world will be in a
[1:17:49] famine. But you won't be in a famine.
[1:17:52] The crus of oil will never run dry.
[1:17:58] I mean,
[1:18:00] you know, you say,
[1:18:02] "Oh,
[1:18:04] wow. That that was pretty easy for
[1:18:06] Elijah. Oh, yeah, brother Brandham. My
[1:18:09] goodness, he had the pillar of fire and
[1:18:10] he had an angel come talk to him. Oh, I
[1:18:13] get. Yeah, he could be an overcomer. Who
[1:18:15] couldn't be an overcomer with all of
[1:18:16] that?" Can you imagine the shock
[1:18:20] on Elijah? Now, just think for a second.
[1:18:22] Put yourself in Elijah's position.
[1:18:26] He's been being taken care of by ravens.
[1:18:31] And and God says, "Now, I've commanded a
[1:18:34] widow."
[1:18:36] And Elijah is like, "Okay, wonderful.
[1:18:39] Let's go. I got the I got the word of
[1:18:41] the Lord. I don't have anything to worry
[1:18:43] about. God's going to take care of me."
[1:18:46] And he gets there and he finds her just
[1:18:48] like the vision showed him. And he says,
[1:18:50] "Hey, bring me bring me a a morsel of
[1:18:53] bread and bring me some water." And she
[1:18:56] says, "I I don't have any What do you
[1:19:00] Huh?
[1:19:02] What? Do you think I'm any different
[1:19:03] than anybody else? I can you imagine the
[1:19:06] shock on Elijah?" Cuz God didn't warn
[1:19:09] him of that. God didn't say, "Now, when
[1:19:11] you get there, she's actually not going
[1:19:13] to have anything to give you." All he
[1:19:15] said was, "I've commanded you go. I I've
[1:19:18] I have ordained this that she's going
[1:19:21] to." And when Elijah gets there, let me
[1:19:23] tell you something, friends. When it
[1:19:24] when when William Brandon went into the
[1:19:26] world, he was rejected and hated of
[1:19:28] everybody, but there was a little bride
[1:19:30] who believed the word. There was a
[1:19:32] people. And he said, "Lord, I know by
[1:19:34] that vision the other day," meaning the
[1:19:36] preview of the bride. He said, "I know
[1:19:38] that your bride is out there somewhere.
[1:19:40] Here's here's thousands of people." Oh
[1:19:42] my goodness. He he had 25,000 in those
[1:19:45] Arkansas meetings. That's what the
[1:19:46] newspaper records. 25,000 people. That's
[1:19:49] what source material records. And we
[1:19:52] find out that that he he's he's coming
[1:19:55] down and he's he's in Chicago. And I
[1:19:58] know you've got a bride out there. He
[1:20:00] knows it's not this whole gang out in
[1:20:02] front of him, but he also knows that by
[1:20:04] that vision, she is out there somewhere.
[1:20:06] He says, "Now, we don't know who she is,
[1:20:09] but I'm just sewing the seed. I'm just
[1:20:11] scattering the seed. Oh, are you one of
[1:20:13] those who got a hold of that seed? I'm
[1:20:15] one of those who got a hold of that and
[1:20:17] I'm not interested in going the world's
[1:20:20] way. I want to go the way of the word. I
[1:20:22] want to go the way of the Lord. I want
[1:20:24] the Holy Ghost to to so that my life
[1:20:27] will glorify the father. I want to be,
[1:20:30] you excuse me if I say it this way. I
[1:20:33] desire to be the the modern event, the
[1:20:37] most modern, the last most modern event
[1:20:40] made clear by prophecy is a bride who's
[1:20:44] leaving in a body change.
[1:20:47] A bride in spite of the darkness is
[1:20:49] believing God for every word and saying
[1:20:52] amen to every word. That is a modern
[1:20:55] event made clear in prophecy.
[1:20:58] You are tonight, friends. Stand to your
[1:21:00] feet with me. say, "I take the
[1:21:02] challenge. I'll be a modern event. I
[1:21:05] won't go the way of the modern world.
[1:21:07] I'll go the way of the word of God." Oh,
[1:21:09] it's ancient. It's old, but it's still
[1:21:11] just as vital. It's still just as
[1:21:14] lifegiving today as it's ever been. And
[1:21:16] even more so because he promised that in
[1:21:20] this day and hour, he would bring a
[1:21:22] global
[1:21:24] an event that's never happened. a global
[1:21:27] bride in one mind and one accord into
[1:21:32] perfect faith, perfect love. And that
[1:21:36] and brother Brandham said, when that
[1:21:38] capstone and that unites with the body,
[1:21:41] then what we've seen in a in a measure
[1:21:45] will become the fullness. Even the dead
[1:21:47] for hundreds of years will be raised
[1:21:50] from the grave.
[1:21:52] That's going to be a modern event.
[1:21:54] That ain't never happened. When that
[1:21:57] happens on that resurrection morning,
[1:21:59] there ain't no more modern of a modern
[1:22:01] event that'll ever happen. Oh, I want to
[1:22:05] be part of that, friends. How about you
[1:22:06] tonight? I say, Lord, I want to be part
[1:22:08] of that. I I want to make a choice. I
[1:22:11] want to choose whom you will serve.
[1:22:13] Choose whom you Can I say it like this?
[1:22:15] Choose whom you'll be on fire for.
[1:22:19] Choose whom you will give your whole
[1:22:20] life to. Don't just make a a decision
[1:22:23] for the man at Calvary. Say, "I want
[1:22:25] that man to live inside of me. I want to
[1:22:28] choose all of the word. I want to choose
[1:22:30] to be the final voice to the final age."
[1:22:35] Oh, that's my desire. Let's raise up our
[1:22:37] hands, Lord God. That's our desire
[1:22:39] tonight, Lord Jesus, to hear this word.
[1:22:42] And it's more than just word. It's more
[1:22:44] than teaching on prophecy, Lord. It's a
[1:22:46] realization of what is before us,
[1:22:50] of the opportunity that we have
[1:22:53] to be so lost in Christ that the enemy
[1:22:57] can't even find us anymore.
[1:23:00] I don't want to be one of those that are
[1:23:03] so tossed about.
[1:23:05] I don't want to be in that lineup that
[1:23:09] says, "Why do people have such a hard
[1:23:13] time living a Christian life?
[1:23:16] Lord, I just don't believe that that's
[1:23:20] what you had planned for when the when
[1:23:23] when when when the great plan of
[1:23:25] redemption that through the indwelling
[1:23:28] of the Holy Ghost that God would go from
[1:23:32] being above us to then being with us to
[1:23:35] then being in us. Not a kingdom of
[1:23:38] freethinkers, but a kingdom of
[1:23:40] likeminded saints who are saying,
[1:23:43] "Amen."
[1:23:44] Oh, I think of that day, Lord. What a
[1:23:47] day that's going to be when all the
[1:23:49] enemy and all of his powers and forces
[1:23:52] and darkness are put in chains, Lord, in
[1:23:55] that 1,000-year millennial reign of
[1:23:57] righteousness. Oh, I want to be a part
[1:23:59] of that lamb of God. I want to be I want
[1:24:02] to I want to be there then because I'm
[1:24:04] choosing you now. Oh, Father, I don't
[1:24:07] want to freload. I don't want to get
[1:24:10] grabbed up just barely. Lord, you had to
[1:24:12] just drag me across the finish line.
[1:24:14] Lord, I want to be when I cross that
[1:24:16] finish line, I want to be at full speed.
[1:24:18] I want to be running. Oh, God, grant it
[1:24:21] to us tonight. We love you, Father. We I
[1:24:24] I trust you'll take this thought tonight
[1:24:26] and make it real to the people as it's
[1:24:28] been made real to me. Oh, why is the
[1:24:32] daughter? She need not be sick. She need
[1:24:34] not be bound. She need not be under some
[1:24:38] bondage of the enemy. Whom the son hath
[1:24:41] made free is free indeed.
[1:24:44] Lord, I pray that that truth
[1:24:47] will have its perfect effectiveness in
[1:24:50] our lives. May we'll we'll go from here
[1:24:53] tonight and we'll realize, Lord, I've
[1:24:55] already seen the type in the Bible. I am
[1:24:57] like that widow in a famine that the
[1:25:00] Bible said would be here at the end
[1:25:02] time. from a famine of hearing the word
[1:25:03] of God. But you would send me Elijah
[1:25:06] and he would challenge me to put you
[1:25:10] first. And I want to say tonight, Lord
[1:25:13] God, help me. Help me, Lord. Help us
[1:25:16] all. Help us to put you first in our
[1:25:19] life, Lord Jesus. First in everything.
[1:25:23] First in our daily activities. First in
[1:25:26] our career decisions, first in our
[1:25:28] friendships, first in our associates,
[1:25:30] first in our social behavior, first in
[1:25:33] everything. Lord, first in our home,

[1:28:00] the impossible situations.
[1:28:03] Uh, Brother Ken Boo turns in an unspoken
[1:28:05] prayer request for God's perfect will in
[1:28:08] a decision they'll they'll be making.
[1:28:11] And, uh, if you've got a need tonight,
[1:28:13] raise up that hand to the Lord.
[1:28:16] Join join with somebody standing near
[1:28:18] you. Let's form a a real prayer bond
[1:28:20] here tonight. Master,
[1:28:22] Lord, having heard this word tonight, we
[1:28:25] feel challenged in our hearts and minds
[1:28:26] to believe you for every word. How could
[1:28:29] we come, Lord, and hear such a word and
[1:28:31] go away wondering? Lord, we have proven
[1:28:33] in the Bible and in the message and and
[1:28:35] Lord, even people have acknowledged in
[1:28:37] this building tonight, you have
[1:28:39] provisioned us with everything. Lord,
[1:28:40] you have thought of everything. You have
[1:28:42] in no way left us uh short. You haven't
[1:28:46] left us, Lord, uh with with with an with
[1:28:49] no way to know how to find our way
[1:28:52] forward. You've opened your word. You've
[1:28:54] sent a glorious light. You've given us
[1:28:56] tremendous revelation. You've separated
[1:28:59] us, Lord, from the world and set us
[1:29:01] apart. And you've revealed yourself to
[1:29:03] us in in un unimaginable ways. And the
[1:29:06] world today still steeped in blindness
[1:29:09] cannot track it. They cannot figure out,
[1:29:12] Lord, what it is that makes us
[1:29:14] different. They admire a lot of our
[1:29:15] difference, but they they're they're
[1:29:17] they're powerless to understand it,
[1:29:20] Lord, unless you reveal it to someone in
[1:29:22] your great mercy. And I am grateful
[1:29:25] tonight for your revealed word. I pray
[1:29:28] tonight, Lord, that you will help us and
[1:29:30] help us in this word that we've heard
[1:29:32] tonight. Lord, I know this that the more
[1:29:35] that we'll surrender, the more you'll
[1:29:37] take control. That's what we know, Lord.
[1:29:39] The more that I surrender, oh God. Oh,
[1:29:42] Father, that that that's why a prophet
[1:29:44] has taught us. The more the more you are
[1:29:46] willing, if you're willing to empty out
[1:29:49] of the world, Christ will come in and
[1:29:51] fill up that place. He won't barge in.
[1:29:54] He won't He won't It's not a coup.
[1:29:56] That's not how he operates. Father, he's
[1:29:59] a gentle savior. He's a timid Holy
[1:30:01] Spirit. He wants He wants it to be love.
[1:30:04] He wants it to be a choice that we make
[1:30:07] for him. Why Why would that seem strange
[1:30:11] to the world? Why would that seem
[1:30:13] strange? we for the person that we we
[1:30:16] love Lord that we spend our life as a
[1:30:18] life's companion with we we it's so
[1:30:21] wonderful to know that our companion I I
[1:30:24] love the fact that my wife chose me and
[1:30:27] of all the billions of men in the world
[1:30:29] she chose me I chose her Lord it was a
[1:30:32] it was such a choice at that time and
[1:30:34] now it has become Lord like the snowball
[1:30:39] rolling down the hill finally it gets so
[1:30:41] big you can't stop it anymore I couldn't
[1:30:43] not choose. Lord, we can't not choose to
[1:30:47] love you. You can't not choose to love
[1:30:49] us. You have filled us with your love
[1:30:52] and your light and your life. And Lord,
[1:30:54] we just say, I want more of it. Lord
[1:30:56] Jesus, more of it. Oh God, help me now
[1:30:59] to take the and say, I will lay aside
[1:31:02] these things. Oh God, help us tonight.
[1:31:05] Help us to be willing to lay aside the
[1:31:08] weights and sins that doth so easily
[1:31:10] beset us so that we can run this race.
[1:31:14] Grant it to us, Lord. Look in my heart.

[1:31:18] you in honesty tonight, Father.
[1:31:21] Now, Lord, these needs that are before
[1:31:24] us, hands that went up, we're looking to
[1:31:27] you to do the impossible for our sister
[1:31:30] Kathy. Lord, the doctor can have
[1:31:32] whatever opinion they have that we we
[1:31:35] are thankful. Lord, we're thankful for
[1:31:37] doctors. You give us you give mankind
[1:31:40] medical knowledge. But Lord, we're
[1:31:42] looking to the great physician. Oh, lamb
[1:31:45] of God, for our sister Kathy, right now,
[1:31:47] we're joining our faith with her faith
[1:31:50] and brother Jack's faith. And prophet
[1:31:52] said, "Now you join your faith to our
[1:31:53] faith, Lord, and push this promise
[1:31:55] through. May our sister Kathy guest be
[1:31:58] made completely whole. May this may this
[1:32:01] drainage and bleeding stop. Oh God, may
[1:32:04] you lay your hand upon her. Father, if
[1:32:06] she was standing here, we'd lay our
[1:32:08] hands upon her and we'd call on the name
[1:32:10] of the Lord. Father, right now through
[1:32:12] the spirit of God, we lay our hands. We
[1:32:15] join our faith. May you, Lord God, bring
[1:32:18] this promise to pass for our sister.
[1:32:20] Take this need that brother Kenny has
[1:32:22] expressed, Father, this unspoken, but
[1:32:25] Lord, you're well aware of the
[1:32:27] situation. and you already have the
[1:32:29] perfect answer. You know what you're
[1:32:30] going to do. How I've seen you do that
[1:32:32] so recently, Lord, in my own life.
[1:32:35] Wonder at this and wonder at that, and
[1:32:36] then just see you come right along. And
[1:32:38] I realize, my goodness, you had a plan
[1:32:40] all along, didn't you, Lord? Oh, Father,
[1:32:42] give us that confidence in you tonight.
[1:32:45] Hallelujah. We're going to believe these
[1:32:47] things, Master. We're going to believe
[1:32:49] that our sister will recover completely.
[1:32:52] We're going to believe that Brother Ken
[1:32:54] will be led to make the perfect
[1:32:56] decision. We're going to believe it.
