[0:02] [Music]
[0:06] Good evening, saints of God.
[0:09] How many h happy to be in the house of
[0:11] the Lord? Amen. Amen. I want you to
[0:13] stand with me. Amen.
[0:18] [Music]
[0:28] I'm pretty excited about this night of
[0:31] worship, this singing special night.
[0:34] Amen. Amen. Give the opportunity to
[0:37] worship the Lord and singing and in
[0:40] fellowship.
[0:41] Amen. Amen.
[0:44] Little by
[0:48] little, you can win every
[0:53] battle. Little by
[0:57] little, you can coner every
[1:01] [Music]
[1:03] foe. And I'll set
[1:07] boundaries around you. They will stretch
[1:11] from sea to sea.
[1:14] And little by
[1:17] little, I will prosper thee. Little by
[1:23] little, little by
[1:27] little, you can win every battle.
[1:34] Little by little, you can coner every
[1:43] hole. And I'll set
[1:46] boundaries around you. They will stretch
[1:50] from sea to sea. And little by
[1:56] little, I will prosper thee.
[2:03] Be thou
[2:06] strong and very
[2:11] courageous.
[2:14] Disposes the
[2:16] inhabitants of your land.
[2:20] [Music]
[2:22] I have given you this
[2:26] promise and it's time to take a
[2:30] stand. You got to drive out your
[2:35] enemy so your family can go free. And
[2:40] little by
[2:42] little, you'll gain the victory in
[2:46] worship. Little by little, little by
[2:53] little, every
[2:56] battle. Oh, little by little, you can
[3:02] coner every
[3:06] hole. And I'll set
[3:10] boundaries around you. They will stretch
[3:14] from sea to sea. And little by
[3:19] little, I will prosper
[3:23] [Music]
[3:25] thee. You've got
[3:28] right in the Holy
[3:32] [Music]
[3:34] Spirit. You've been
[3:36] given full
[3:39] authority in his name.
[3:42] [Music]
[3:44] There's no time left now for
[3:47] crying. It's a shame to
[3:52] complain. You got to keep the devil off
[3:55] your
[3:56] mountain. You're predestined and
[4:01] ordained. Don't you know that you're a
[4:05] soldier in the army of the king? And
[4:10] little by
[4:13] little, you can win every
[4:18] battle. Oh, little by little, you can
[4:23] coner every
[4:27] hole. And I'll set
[4:30] boundaries around you. They will stretch
[4:34] from sea to sea. And little by
[4:39] little I will prosper
[4:43] thee. Listen up. You have
[4:48] truly truly been
[4:53] commissioned by the
[4:56] captain
[4:58] of the host.
[5:02] [Music]
[5:03] You're equipped to fight the
[5:07] battle even though it is the
[5:11] Lord. Prayer makes
[5:14] [Music]
[5:16] the Christian can't take
[5:20] hold. Prayer makes the demons
[5:25] tremble. But it puts God in control. And
[5:30] little by
[5:32] little, we'll possess the
[5:35] land. Little by little, little by
[5:40] little, you can win every
[5:46] battle. Little by little, you can
[5:54] coner. And I'll set
[5:58] boundaries around you. They will stretch
[6:02] from sea to sea. And little by
[6:07] little, I will
[6:10] [Music]
[6:12] prosper. Little by
[6:15] little, I will prosper
[6:20] thee. Let's give the Lord a hand.
[6:27] Amen. You may be seated.
[6:30] [Music]
[6:55] to
[6:56] you. This is my
[7:12] [Music]
[7:28] This is my
[7:31] worship. This is my
[7:33] [Music]
[7:35] offering. In every
[7:39] moment I withhold
[7:43] nothing. I'm learning to trust
[7:48] you. Even when I can't see
[7:52] it. And even in
[7:56] suffering, I have to believe it.
[8:02] If you say it's wrong, then I'll say no.
[8:06] If you say release, I'm letting go. If
[8:11] you're in it with me, I'll begin. When
[8:15] you say to jump, I'm diving in. If you
[8:20] say be still, then I will wait. If you
[8:24] say to trust, I will oy. I don't want to
[8:29] follow my own way. I'm done chasing
[8:34] feelings. Spirit lead
[8:43] [Music]
[8:52] me. I felt like a burden.
[8:57] But once I could grasp
[9:01] it, you took me
[9:04] further, further than I was
[9:09] asking. And simply to see
[9:13] you. It's worth it
[9:17] all. My life is an altar.
[9:22] Let your fire
[9:26] fall. If you say it's wrong, then I'll
[9:30] say no. If you say release, I'm letting
[9:34] go. If you're in it with me, I'll begin.
[9:39] When you say to jump, I'm diving in. If
[9:44] you say be still, then I will wait. If
[9:48] you say I trust I will oy. Teach me how
[9:53] to follow in your way. I'm done chasing
[9:58] feelings. Spirit lead
[10:02] [Music]
[10:10] me. When all hope is
[10:14] gone and your word is all I've
[10:19] got, I have to
[10:22] believe you still bring water from the
[10:27] rocks to satisfy my
[10:31] thirst. To love me at my
[10:35] worst. And even when I don't
[10:39] remember, you remind me of my
[10:44] worth. I don't trust my
[10:48] ways. I'm trading in my
[10:52] thoughts. I lay down
[10:56] everything. Cuz you're all that I
[11:00] want. I landed on my knees.
[11:05] This is the cup you have for
[11:08] me. And even when it don't make
[11:12] sense, I'm going to let your spirit
[11:21] be. I'm going to let your spirit
[11:26] [Music]
[11:29] be. I'm going to let your spirit be.
[11:35] [Music]
[11:38] I'm going to let your spirit
[11:43] lead
[11:44] [Music]
[11:46] me.
[11:48] Spirit lead
[11:54] me. Holy Spirit, lead me.
[12:04] Spirit lead
[12:08] [Music]
[12:11] me.
[12:13] Spirit lead
[12:16] me. And if you say it's wrong, then I'll
[12:20] say no. If you say release, I'm letting
[12:25] go. If you're in it with me, I'll begin.
[12:30] And when you say to jump, I'm diving in.
[12:34] If you say be still, then I will wait.
[12:38] If you say to trust, I will oy. You're
[12:43] the only truth life away. I'm done
[12:47] chasing
[12:49] feelings. Spirit, lead me.
[12:53] [Music]
[12:59] Spirit lead me.
[13:04] [Music]
[13:23] [Music]
[13:28] [Music]
[13:52] God bless y'all.
[13:56] [Music]
[14:10] I have wrestled in the
[14:13] darkness of this holy pilgrim
[14:17] land, raising strong and mighty
[14:22] fortresses that I long command.
[14:26] But these castles I've
[14:29] constructed by the strength of my own
[14:33] hands are just
[14:35] temporary kingdom on foundation made of
[14:41] sand in the middle of the
[14:45] battle. I believe I finally
[14:48] found. I'll never know the thrill of
[14:53] victory until I'm willing to let
[14:57] down all my weapons of defense and ugly
[15:03] strategies of
[15:05] war. So I'm laying down my arms and
[15:09] running helplessly to yours.
[15:14] I
[15:15] surrender
[15:17] all my silent hopes and
[15:21] dreams. Oh, the price to
[15:25] follow cost me
[15:29] everything. I
[15:31] surrender
[15:32] all my human soul desires.
[15:38] Sacrifice
[15:40] requires that all my kingdoms fall. I
[15:46] surrender
[15:49] [Music]
[15:54] all. If the source of my
[15:58] ambition is the treasure I obtain.
[16:03] If I measure my
[16:05] successes on a scale of every
[16:10] game, the focus of my
[16:14] vision is the status I
[16:18] obtain. My accomplishments are worthless
[16:22] and my efforts are in vain.
[16:27] So I lay aside these
[16:29] trophies to pursue a higher
[16:33] crown. Should you choose to use slide
[16:38] fight willingly lay
[16:41] down, I surrender all the
[16:45] trials. Glor is only by your
[16:49] grace. I relinquish all the glory. I
[16:54] surrender all the
[16:58] praise. I
[16:59] surrender
[17:01] all my silent hopes and
[17:05] dreams and hold the price to
[17:09] follow. Cost me
[17:13] everything. I surrender
[17:17] all. My human soul
[17:21] desires.
[17:23] Sacrifice
[17:25] requires that all my kingdoms fall. I
[17:31] surrender
[17:35] all. Everything I am, all I've done, and
[17:41] all I've
[17:43] known, it now belongs to you. Just like
[17:47] my is not my
[17:50] own. Just as Abraham laid
[17:54] Isaac on a sacrificial
[17:59] fire. All I have is all that you
[18:04] require. I
[18:05] [Applause]
[18:07] surrender all.
[18:12] [Music]
[18:21] I surrender
[18:24] all my silent hopes and
[18:28] dreams. Although the price to
[18:32] follow cost me everything.
[18:37] I surrender
[18:39] all my human soul
[18:44] desire to
[18:45] sacrifice
[18:47] require. Let all my kingdoms
[18:51] fall. Let all my kingdoms fall. I
[18:57] surrender
[19:01] [Music]
[19:08] [Applause]
[19:15] [Music]
[19:20] all. Brother Ray, if you come on,
[19:22] brother.
[19:25] We were going to have brother Lo sing
[19:28] for us this evening, but his stroke's
[19:30] not doing very well. So, let's just keep
[19:33] him in your prayers. Amen. We're going
[19:36] to have brother Ray give us a special
[19:38] this evening. Amen.
[20:22] [Music]
[20:30] God bless you,
[20:31] bride. Amen. It's an honor and a
[20:34] privilege to be amongst
[20:38] uh group of people that I plan on
[20:40] spending eternity
[20:42] with. And I believe that we have stepped
[20:44] into eternity.
[20:47] And I love the Lord Jesus. Got this.

[29:13] me when I was so
[29:21] lonely. He found me when I
[29:26] was so blue.
[29:30] [Music]
[29:32] And he found me when no
[29:37] one could help
[29:41] me. When no one knew just
[29:47] what to
[29:53] do.

[51:19] think what was on his mind.
[51:23] [Music]
[51:25] As he slowly reached the water's edge,
[51:29] will it rush in over his head? He looks
[51:33] to see if the curse has washed
[51:39] away. Oh,
[51:41] does
[51:43] he
[51:46] say I keep going down and getting back
[51:50] up, but I see no change. I feel no touch
[51:55] from
[51:56] you. Lord, where could you
[52:01] be? Well, this water's dirty and it's
[52:05] cold, but there's healing in it. So, I'm
[52:09] told. But a

[52:42] inside. Well, I've heard your voice a
[52:45] thousand times.
[52:48] But now that seems so long
[52:51] [Music]
[52:53] ago. Oh, but deep inside I still
[52:57] believe. Lord, somewhere you're
[53:01] listening. But I would like a sign so I
[53:05] could
[53:06] know.
[53:08] Oh, surely there's hope left yet. cuz
[53:13] you wouldn't just forget. I'm fighting
[53:17] on my knees to get to
[53:21] you. So this is what I'm going to
[53:29] do. I'll keep going down and getting
[53:33] back up till I see a change or feel a
[53:38] touch from you.
[53:40] I know you're hearing
[53:44] me. Well, this place is lonely and it's
[53:48] cold, but is holy ground. So, I'm told
[53:53] the secret place where you will meet
[53:56] with
[53:58] me. So, I'm staying here until you're
[54:03] through. Lord, until I get a hold of
[54:07] you, I'm going to keep believing. But
[54:12] until then, I'm going to go down
[54:20] again and again.
[54:27] [Music]
[54:28] I'll keep going down and getting back up
[54:33] till I see a change or feel a touch from
[54:37] you. Cuz I know you're hearing
[54:42] me. Oh, this place can be lonely and
[54:46] it's cold, but it's holy ground. I know
[54:50] it's true. It's the secret place. Will
[54:54] you will meet with me?
[54:58] So I'm standing here until you're

[57:36] bad stuff in that book. And I didn't
[57:38] know what to do. I needed to get rid of
[57:39] it. It was tough cuz I knew there was
[57:41] thousands of dollars invested in all
[57:42] those CDs and everything else. And I

[57:46] those glass cases and I looked and it

[1:03:06] back to the way it used to be before
[1:03:11] your presence came. Oh, and change
[1:03:15] me. And I won't go back. I can't go back
[1:03:21] to the way it used to be before your
[1:03:26] presence came and changed
[1:03:30] me. It changed me.
[1:03:35] [Music]
[1:03:36] [Applause]
[1:03:38] [Music]
[1:03:39] [Applause]
[1:03:44] It's okay.
[1:03:46] Praise the Lord. Amen. And thank you,
[1:03:48] Lord, for your presence that changes us.
[1:03:52] Amen. Amen.
[1:03:54] [Music]
[1:04:00] Amen.
[1:04:01] Amen. Amen. This song was actually
[1:04:03] inspired
[1:04:06] um through
[1:04:09] uh a
[1:04:11] situation, circumstances that were
[1:04:13] beyond my
[1:04:14] control. Amen. but that Satan took
[1:04:17] advantage of to try to throw me off,
[1:04:21] tried to attack me spiritually, tried to
[1:04:24] he just put me in a place that I I I did
[1:04:27] didn't want to be in. And um it's funny,
[1:04:29] you know, when you get saved, you think
[1:04:30] all of that is behind you, but the
[1:04:32] battle continues, doesn't it? And then a
[1:04:36] lot of times, nobody really wants to
[1:04:37] admit that those battles exist.
[1:04:40] And uh man, they existed for me. And I
[1:04:44] have an amazing family, an amazing wife.
[1:04:47] Amen. Goodness gracious. I don't even
[1:04:49] know. Sometimes when I turn, look in the
[1:04:52] passenger seat of the car, I'm just glad
[1:04:54] she's still there. Amen. But
[1:04:56] uh you can go through some real hard
[1:04:59] times,
[1:05:01] insane times. It feels like it feels
[1:05:02] like you're going crazy. Amen. And uh
[1:05:05] situations, circumstances beyond your
[1:05:08] control. And then it started to affect
[1:05:10] my spiritual life, my spiritual walk,
[1:05:12] and my faith. not shaken
[1:05:16] but just wanted to know where it went at
[1:05:19] times, you
[1:05:21] know. Anyway, so I was in church, little
[1:05:25] church, and uh this brother got up to
[1:05:29] minister and I expected nothing. And God
[1:05:33] came through that brother and he took a
[1:05:36] subject called the inner man.
[1:05:39] And man, it changed me, you know. And in
[1:05:42] that moment, I was free. I knew I was
[1:05:44] free. It didn't matter anymore. Amen.
[1:05:47] So, I can say tonight, if you're dealing
[1:05:49] with that, and guess what? Every one of
[1:05:51] us deals with those kind of things and
[1:05:53] and those situations. You can come to
[1:05:55] church, you can smile, right, brother
[1:05:57] Tim? You can say, "Everything's good."
[1:05:58] You can sing, "All is well, Brother
[1:06:01] Leno, but when you go home, it's pretty
[1:06:03] dark." But God, the great deliverer,
[1:06:06] Jehovah Gyra, Amen. And he can come on
[1:06:08] the scene and deliver you anytime, any
[1:06:11] place, anywhere. Amen. Do you believe
[1:06:12] that? Amen.
[1:06:15] Amen. It just
[1:06:16] takes trusting in him.
[1:06:20] Amen.
[1:06:24] Excuses. There's one for everything
[1:06:28] that's wrong with me.
[1:06:33] And Satan tries to tell me I've got
[1:06:38] time. You
[1:06:39] [Music]
[1:06:44] see
[1:06:48] confusion. Lord, let the false desires
[1:06:52] fade
[1:06:53] [Music]
[1:06:56] away. Here's my heart. Please make it a
[1:07:01] sweet dwelling
[1:07:03] [Music]
[1:07:08] place. Oh, I want to make things
[1:07:12] right. Let this be the night I am set
[1:07:18] [Music]
[1:07:22] free. And Lord, I come to you.
[1:07:28] fall down on my
[1:07:30] knees and I ask of
[1:07:34] you to make my life an
[1:07:38] image of all that's
[1:07:44] true. And Lord, I run to you.
[1:07:49] [Music]
[1:07:50] Father, I can hear you
[1:07:53] calling for your
[1:07:57] son. Perform a work in me never to be
[1:08:05] undone. Oh Lord, I
[1:08:11] [Music]
[1:08:16] come forgiven.
[1:08:20] It's in your grace this inner
[1:08:23] man's been
[1:08:26] found. And all the chains of this world
[1:08:30] now lay on the
[1:08:38] ground,
[1:08:41] justified through the power of your
[1:08:44] blood. I've been set free.
[1:08:50] My sins are gone, no longer in your
[1:08:57] memory.
[1:08:59] Oh, you came and made things
[1:09:03] right. Gave me back my sight. I am set
[1:09:09] free. Oh yes, I'm free. I'm free indeed.
[1:09:13] And Lord, I come to you.
[1:09:18] bow down at your
[1:09:20] feet. And I ask of
[1:09:24] you to make my life an
[1:09:28] image of all that's
[1:09:33] true. Oh, and Lord, I run to
[1:09:39] you. Father, I can hear you
[1:09:43] calling for your son.
[1:09:47] perform a work in me never to be
[1:09:54] undone. Oh Lord, I
[1:10:02] come. Oh Lord, I
[1:10:07] [Music]
[1:10:10] come. Oh
[1:10:13] Lord, I come.

[1:10:30] God bless
[1:10:31] [Applause]
[1:10:39] you. Amen. Let's stand really quick.
[1:10:44] We're going to take a quick quick
[1:10:47] intermission. Go out, stretch your feet,
[1:10:50] shake a little bit, use the restroom,
[1:10:52] and get back soon as possible. I'm not
[1:10:54] going to put a time on it, but we're
[1:10:57] just going to give you a few minutes to
[1:10:59] rest and kind of stretch a bit, and then
[1:11:01] we'll start right back singing. Okay.

[1:29:26] For anyone who's ever felt the hand of
[1:29:29] heaven reach down through their fears

[1:29:55] [Music]
[1:29:56] So if I shout, no I'm shouting from a
[1:30:00] heart that's been washed clean. And if I
[1:30:02] run, no, I'm running. From a past that's
[1:30:05] been redeemed to the world, it might
[1:30:08] look crazy. But there's just no telling
[1:30:11] what you're going to
[1:30:14] do. In that moment, Jesus gets a hold of
[1:30:19] you. Oh, praise
[1:30:22] God. for anyone who knows the hope that
[1:30:26] keeps them moving on through troubled
[1:30:29] [Music]
[1:30:32] days. For anyone who knows they've got a
[1:30:36] future and a hope beyond the
[1:30:42] grave. Every life's a different story.
[1:30:46] How he led us out of darkness into
[1:30:50] light. victory
[1:30:53] light. There's no way to keep us silent.
[1:30:56] Every vers another chance to
[1:31:00] testify to
[1:31:03] testify. So if I shall know I'm shouting
[1:31:07] from a heart that's been washed clean
[1:31:09] and my ride know I'm running from a past
[1:31:13] that's been redeemed to the world. It
[1:31:16] might look crazy, but there's just no
[1:31:18] telling what you're going to
[1:31:21] do. In that moment, Jesus, get a hold of
[1:31:30] you. Carry on now, my brother. Carry on

[1:32:01] sisters. Carry on now, my brothers.
[1:32:05] Carry on now, my
[1:32:07] sisters. Just like the Holy Spirit's got
[1:32:10] a hold of you. So in my shell, no I'm
[1:32:14] shouting from a heart that's been washed
[1:32:17] clean. And in my run, no I'm running
[1:32:20] from a
[1:32:22] life to the world. It might look crazy,
[1:32:25] but there's just no telling what you're
[1:32:28] going to
[1:32:29] do. In that moment, Jesus gets a hold of
[1:32:38] you. Carry on now, my brothers. Carry on
[1:32:42] now, my
[1:32:45] sister.
[1:32:48] Oh, carry on now, my brothers. Carry on
[1:32:52] now, my
[1:32:55] [Music]
[1:32:59] sisters. Carry on now, my brothers.

[1:33:07] [Applause]
[1:33:10] Carry on now, my brothers. Carry on now,
[1:33:13] my
[1:33:14] sisters. Just like Jesus got a hold of
[1:33:18] you. So if I shout, no, I'm shouting.
[1:33:22] From a heart that's been washed clean.
[1:33:24] And if I run, no, I'm running from a
[1:33:28] past that's been redeemed. To the world,
[1:33:31] it might look crazy. There's just no
[1:33:34] telling what you're going to do.
[1:33:38] And that moment when Jesus gets a hold
[1:33:41] of
[1:33:43] you. Oh. So if I shout, go I'm shouting.
[1:33:48] From a heart that's been washed clean.
[1:33:50] And if I run, go, I'm running. From a
[1:33:54] past that's been redeemed to the world,
[1:33:57] it might look crazy. But there's just no
[1:34:00] telling what you're going to
[1:34:03] do. In that moment, Jesus gets a hold of
[1:34:10] you. When he gets a hold of you.

[1:34:17] [Applause]
[1:34:19] [Music]
[1:34:35] [Music]
[1:35:02] From his glory he came
[1:35:05] down. God in flesh and
[1:35:09] bone set aside his royal
[1:35:13] crown for a lonely dusty
[1:35:18] road. That doesn't sound like I love
[1:35:26] you. Then hear what Calary has to say.
[1:35:34] The cross must have
[1:35:37] whispered and the spear must have
[1:35:41] shouted. The crown of thorns revealed
[1:35:45] what must be
[1:35:48] said. And though I love you wasn't
[1:35:53] spoken through the lips of the Savior.
[1:35:59] He said, "I love you with three nails
[1:36:11] instead." Every stripe upon his
[1:36:15] back was mercy in
[1:36:19] disguise, tears of sorrow pouring
[1:36:23] out. Was redemption in his eyes?
[1:36:27] [Music]
[1:36:28] that doesn't sound like I love
[1:36:35] you. Then hear what
[1:36:38] Calary has to
[1:36:42] say. The cross must have whispered and
[1:36:47] the spear must have
[1:36:49] shouted. The crown of thorns revealed
[1:36:53] what must be said.
[1:36:57] Though I love you wasn't
[1:37:00] spoken from the lips of the
[1:37:05] Savior. And he said, "I love you with
[1:37:10] three nails
[1:37:14] instead." Have you ever felt unelained?
[1:37:22] Have you ever felt
[1:37:25] abandoned by the sin that bears your
[1:37:32] name? The cross must have
[1:37:36] whispered. And the spear must have
[1:37:40] shouted. The crown of thorns reveal what
[1:37:45] must be said.
[1:37:48] Though I love you as
[1:37:51] spoken from the lips of the
[1:37:56] Savior. He said, "I love you with three
[1:38:01] nails instead."
[1:38:06] I love you was
[1:38:08] spoken through the lips of the Savior.
[1:38:17] He said, "I love you with three nails
[1:38:22] instead."
[1:38:23] [Music]
[1:38:28] Three nails instead.
[1:38:35] [Applause]
[1:38:42] Amen.
[1:39:12] That's
[1:39:16] Hey, y'all ain't supposed to laugh that
[1:39:17] much.
[1:39:20] [Music]
[1:39:23] Praise be to God. My my my
[1:39:28] what singing. Glorious singing tonight.
[1:39:30] And I tell you, I was telling a brother
[1:39:32] out there, I said, "We're just so
[1:39:34] blessed to have." See, the devil could
[1:39:37] have had all of you wonderful singers.
[1:39:39] But I'm glad that we got you. Amen.
[1:39:41] Hallelujah.
[1:39:43] Oh my. Get this pick here. I'll give you
[1:39:46] pink pick back to you, brother. Just a
[1:39:48] minute. Which one we do? B flat
[1:39:52] [Music]
[1:39:55] first. And B flat. Let's try that.
[1:40:00] How many of you glad you're a trophy of
[1:40:02] grace?
[1:40:05] Brother Lenn, I hate you ain't going to
[1:40:06] get to sing tonight, brother. I sure
[1:40:08] was. Looking forward to
[1:40:14] that. How's it start off?
[1:40:18] All right. I always got to ask her how
[1:40:19] it starts off cuz I never remember it.
[1:40:22] We're We're professionals in case you
[1:40:24] didn't know
[1:40:26] that. I never was a good
[1:40:32] man. It was much the other
[1:40:37] [Music]
[1:40:40] way. And I know how it
[1:40:47] feels to want to give up on some days.
[1:40:56] And I might hold the
[1:41:02] record for the most mistakes made.
[1:41:08] [Music]
[1:41:12] But to a man called
[1:41:17] Jesus, I'm a trophy of
[1:41:21] [Music]
[1:41:25] grace. And no, I don't
[1:41:31] deserve all this love that comes my
[1:41:39] way. And anyone who really
[1:41:43] knows
[1:41:46] me can't believe I'm
[1:41:54] okay. And you may never find my
[1:42:01] name in some old
[1:42:04] hall of fame.
[1:42:09] But he's got a place to put
[1:42:15] me cuz I'm his trophy of grace.
[1:42:24] Now it's just in our
[1:42:27] [Music]
[1:42:30] nature to wander
[1:42:33] outside the
[1:42:38] lines till pain and
[1:42:41] [Music]
[1:42:45] disappointments make their way into our
[1:42:49] lives.
[1:42:50] [Applause]
[1:42:53] But
[1:42:54] unmmerited
[1:42:59] favor. It conquers all our sin and
[1:43:07] shame. And we become God's
[1:43:13] treasures. And Satan's prize is torn
[1:43:18] away.
[1:43:22] And no, I don't
[1:43:26] [Music]
[1:43:28] deserve all this love that comes my
[1:43:36] way. And anyone who really knows
[1:43:42] me can't believe I'm okay.
[1:43:51] And you may never find my
[1:43:57] name in some old
[1:44:00] hall of
[1:44:01] [Music]
[1:44:04] fame. But he's got a place to put
[1:44:11] me. I'm his trophy of grace.
[1:44:17] [Music]
[1:44:22] [Applause]
[1:44:27] They ask us to do too. So I want to read
[1:44:31] this to you. The second song we're going
[1:44:33] to sing is what's the name of it? Still
[1:44:37] God. He's still God.
[1:44:39] Amen. We're going to sing this one in
[1:44:43] E. E. That's right. That's just before
[1:44:46] F.
[1:44:48] Now, brother got up here a little bit
[1:44:50] ago and he said D# sharp one. Somebody
[1:44:52] said E flat. I still don't know which
[1:44:53] one it is. It's either D# sharp or E
[1:44:55] flat
[1:44:57] one. But brother Brandham said this. He
[1:45:00] was speaking about this song we're going
[1:45:03] to sing. The second verse says that he
[1:45:05] was watching all the while. Brother
[1:45:08] Brandham said when he sent the disciples
[1:45:11] across the sea, they got in the storm.
[1:45:14] He said all hopes was gone. But you know
[1:45:16] what? He was still watching them. The
[1:45:19] Bible said he climbed up the mountain
[1:45:21] and he was standing up there watching
[1:45:23] them, seeing what they that they was in
[1:45:26] trouble. I'm so glad that grace is still
[1:45:28] in existence. If it wasn't, we'd all be
[1:45:31] gone.
[1:45:32] Amen. Now I got to find the song. Let's
[1:45:36] go
[1:45:37] back. Where's it at? Right there. You
[1:45:39] help me out. She's my
[1:45:41] navigator. There it is.
[1:45:47] [Music]
[1:45:48] Well, I thought that it would
[1:45:55] happen to
[1:45:58] anyone but me.
[1:46:02] I never
[1:46:03] dreamed that I would
[1:46:08] carry this heavy
[1:46:11] burden on my
[1:46:15] knees. I never thought that I'd be
[1:46:23] standing just
[1:46:25] where I stand today.
[1:46:30] I've never
[1:46:32] known this kind of
[1:46:36] heartbreak. I've never
[1:46:39] felt this kind of
[1:46:42] pain. But you're still gone.
[1:46:48] When my eyes have cried a
[1:46:53] million
[1:46:57] tears, you're still gone.
[1:47:02] When my
[1:47:03] last hope has
[1:47:10] disappeared, you're still
[1:47:14] gone and I know you'll make a
[1:47:20] way somehow.
[1:47:25] You're still
[1:47:28] God and you're
[1:47:31] holding me right
[1:47:35] [Music]
[1:47:39] now. My
[1:47:41] heart can't find the
[1:47:46] answer for the
[1:47:48] reason for this trial.
[1:47:53] Lord, I
[1:47:55] know your ways are
[1:47:59] perfect and you've been
[1:48:03] watching all the
[1:48:07] while to
[1:48:09] me. You've
[1:48:11] proven
[1:48:14] faithful time and time again.
[1:48:21] And I'm
[1:48:22] learning, Lord, to trust
[1:48:27] you. Even when I don't
[1:48:32] understand, cuz you're still
[1:48:37] gone. When my eyes have cried a
[1:48:43] million
[1:48:45] [Music]
[1:48:46] tears, you're still gone.
[1:48:51] When my
[1:48:53] last to hope has
[1:49:00] disappeared, you're still
[1:49:04] gone and I know you'll make the
[1:49:09] way somehow.
[1:49:14] You're still
[1:49:17] God and you're
[1:49:20] holding me right
[1:49:23] [Music]
[1:49:26] now. You're still
[1:49:31] gone. When my eyes have cried a
[1:49:37] million
[1:49:40] tears, you're still gone.
[1:49:45] When my
[1:49:46] last hope has
[1:49:50] [Music]
[1:49:53] disappeared, you're still
[1:49:57] gone and I know you'll make a
[1:50:03] way somehow.
[1:50:08] You're still
[1:50:11] gone and you're
[1:50:13] holding
[1:50:15] me right now.
[1:50:18] [Music]
[1:50:24] [Applause]
[1:51:12] [Music]
[1:51:27] I walk
[1:51:29] by the tomb of
[1:51:33] Buddha. Looked
[1:51:37] inside and saw his
[1:51:41] bones. I traveled
[1:51:44] on to see
[1:51:48] Mohamad still wrapped
[1:51:52] up in his grave clothes.
[1:51:57] Then I
[1:51:59] journey to a
[1:52:03] garden where old
[1:52:06] Joseph left him
[1:52:11] lay precious
[1:52:13] lamb. God's own
[1:52:17] begotten was no
[1:52:21] longer in that grave.
[1:52:26] If you knew
[1:52:29] him like I know
[1:52:32] him, you would know
[1:52:36] that he's alive.
[1:52:41] And if you felt
[1:52:44] him like I feel
[1:52:47] him
[1:52:51] resurrection deep
[1:52:54] inside you know he's
[1:52:58] living and death has
[1:53:01] [Music]
[1:53:05] died. Now, if you're
[1:53:09] wondering through the
[1:53:13] darkness, come and
[1:53:16] step into the
[1:53:20] light. Nail scarred
[1:53:24] hands reach out to help
[1:53:27] you and pull you
[1:53:31] safe from death to life.
[1:53:36] Friend, I
[1:53:38] do have stood where you
[1:53:42] stand. Could I
[1:53:45] trust in things
[1:53:49] unseen? But just one
[1:53:52] step in his
[1:53:56] direction. Been in
[1:53:59] love. He ran to
[1:54:03] me. If you knew
[1:54:07] him like I know
[1:54:10] him, you would know
[1:54:14] that he's alive.
[1:54:18] If you felt
[1:54:21] him like I feel
[1:54:24] him
[1:54:28] resurrect deep
[1:54:31] inside you know he's
[1:54:35] living and death is
[1:54:38] done. Oh if you knew
[1:54:42] him like I know
[1:54:45] him. You would know
[1:54:49] that he's
[1:54:53] alive if you felt
[1:54:56] him like I feel
[1:54:59] him for
[1:55:03] resurrection deep inside.
[1:55:07] You know he's
[1:55:10] living and death has
[1:55:13] died. You know he's
[1:55:17] living and death has died.
[1:55:21] [Music]
[1:55:32] [Applause]
[1:55:59] I hope The song is a blessing because
[1:56:01] brother Jason special requested it for
[1:56:03] me to learn it.
[1:56:05] So I hope it blesses your hearts like it
[1:56:08] has mine.
[1:56:09] [Music]
[1:56:21] [Music]
[1:56:52] Moses stood on the
[1:56:54] [Music]
[1:56:59] mountain waiting for you to pass
[1:57:05] by. You put your hands over his
[1:57:13] face so in your presence he wouldn't
[1:57:20] die. And all of
[1:57:23] Israel saw the
[1:57:26] glory in a shine down through the
[1:57:32] [Music]
[1:57:36] age. Now you've called me to
[1:57:40] boldly
[1:57:42] seek your
[1:57:47] face. Show me your face.
[1:57:55] Lord, show me your
[1:58:03] face and then gird up my lens that I may
[1:58:09] stand in this holy
[1:58:12] [Music]
[1:58:15] [Applause]
[1:58:17] place. Show me your face.
[1:58:23] Lord, your power and your grace. Your
[1:58:29] power and
[1:58:32] grace. I will make it to the
[1:58:38] end. If I can just
[1:58:41] see your face.
[1:58:50] David knew there was something
[1:58:56] more than the ark of your
[1:59:04] presence in a manger.
[1:59:07] Messiah was
[1:59:11] born among king and
[1:59:18] peasants. And all of
[1:59:21] Israel saw the
[1:59:24] glory that is shine down through the
[1:59:29] age.
[1:59:30] [Music]
[1:59:34] Now you've called us to
[1:59:37] boldly seek your
[1:59:44] face. Show me your
[1:59:48] face,
[1:59:52] Lord. Show me your face.
[1:59:58] [Music]
[2:00:02] and up my legs that I might stand in
[2:00:07] this holy
[2:00:13] place. Show me your
[2:00:17] face,
[2:00:20] Lord. Your power and your grace, your
[2:00:26] power and
[2:00:29] grace. I will make it to the
[2:00:33] [Music]
[2:00:34] end if I can just
[2:00:37] see your
[2:00:40] face.
[2:00:43] Oh, I know I will make it to the
[2:00:49] end if I can just
[2:00:52] see your face.
[2:00:55] [Music]
[2:01:00] [Applause]
[2:01:18] Lord. Amen. Amen. And I sure am enjoying
[2:01:23] all of this anointed singing. And I
[2:01:26] certainly agree that the enemy would
[2:01:28] have liked to have had every one of
[2:01:29] these singers. I'm glad the Lord
[2:01:31] preserved. Amen. When there was all
[2:01:33] those in the Bible that had bowed the
[2:01:36] knee to Baal, there was a a chosen few
[2:01:38] that had not done that. You feel like
[2:01:40] that chosen few tonight. Amen. We're
[2:01:43] happy to have you all out here tonight.
[2:01:45] We're gonna get ready to change and let
[2:01:47] brother Tim take it from here on and
[2:01:49] then we've got some fellowship going.
[2:01:51] The night's still young. I mean, if we
[2:01:53] would have only started about 44 minutes
[2:01:55] ago if this would have been a regular
[2:01:56] service. So, Amen. We should still have
[2:01:58] plenty in the tank. Amen. Praise the
[2:02:00] Lord. When Brother Joe got up here and I
[2:02:03] saw him put that capo on the end of that
[2:02:05] guitar, man, that brought back some
[2:02:07] memories. Amen. That's actually a hood
[2:02:09] ornament off a 58 Cadillac if y'all
[2:02:11] didn't know it.
[2:02:14] And uh they they told him that um he was
[2:02:16] going to sing too. I said there should
[2:02:18] have been a zero behind that. Him and
[2:02:20] Sister Becky ain't been here in so long.
[2:02:22] Amen. So we're happy to have all the
[2:02:24] singers. Amen. Wes got out of his third
[2:02:26] song. I'm not sure how Lenal got out of
[2:02:29] his. I don't know how that pulled that
[2:02:30] off, but we've always there's always
[2:02:32] tomorrow. Amen. Praise the Lord. I just
[2:02:36] love the Lord and I love the testimonies
[2:02:39] that have come.
[2:02:41] You know, I I think we all tonight
[2:02:43] probably relate to some of the comments
[2:02:45] Brother Wesley was making. And you know,
[2:02:48] sometimes things can come in and
[2:02:50] challenge our faith. Amen. Doesn't mean
[2:02:53] that I mean, you know, you didn't you
[2:02:55] didn't go get your faith, so somebody
[2:02:57] can't come in and take it from you.
[2:02:58] That's something that's born inside of
[2:03:00] you, and nothing can take it. But boy,
[2:03:03] the devil can sure challenge it. You
[2:03:04] know, Brother Brandham said that that
[2:03:06] every one of us that Satan's got a punch
[2:03:09] coming and you got to be ready for it.
[2:03:12] Amen. And so I sure have had mine. Jesus
[2:03:14] had his. I'm sure many of us have had
[2:03:17] many times where the enemy come in like
[2:03:19] a flood, but the Lord preserved. Amen.
[2:03:22] I'm so glad tonight. I feel like so much
[2:03:25] like brother Brandham tonight. I was
[2:03:27] standing back here thinking I don't look
[2:03:28] anything like him. I don't sound like
[2:03:29] him. I sure don't preach like him. But I
[2:03:32] feel like tonight I'm exactly like him
[2:03:33] because I've never take an offering up
[2:03:35] in my life until
[2:03:37] [Music]
[2:03:39] tonight. I can honestly say like brother
[2:03:41] Brandham, I've never took up an
[2:03:42] offering. I don't ever remember taking
[2:03:45] up an offering. We've taken plenty of
[2:03:46] offerings in here, but it wasn't me
[2:03:48] taking them up. So, I'm going to ask
[2:03:50] Brother Luther to come on up here and
[2:03:51] bring the uh basket. Brother Brandham
[2:03:53] taught us that no service is complete
[2:03:56] without taking up an offering. Amen.
[2:03:59] Praise the Lord. So this will be your
[2:04:01] opportunity. Amen. To give as unto the
[2:04:03] Lord. Now you've already gave coming out
[2:04:05] tonight. So I'm happy with just that.
[2:04:08] And and praise the Lord. So we're Oh, is
[2:04:10] it up here, Brother Luther? Oh,
[2:04:12] okay. Is that the large one? Is
[2:04:15] that it'll work. It'll work. Amen.
[2:04:18] Praise the Lord. Amen. Let's bow our
[2:04:20] heads just for a moment of prayer. Lord,
[2:04:24] how we're grateful to you for this
[2:04:26] evening, Lord. these wonderful songs and
[2:04:28] fellowship and testimonies. And Lord, we
[2:04:31] are looking now for the continuation.
[2:04:33] Now, we have one more part tonight,
[2:04:36] Lord, and then we have a fellowship
[2:04:38] planned and then we're right back
[2:04:39] tomorrow. We we have teaching and
[2:04:42] preaching, Lord, and more singing. And
[2:04:44] this has just been a whole weekend
[2:04:46] dedicated to you, Lord, moving among
[2:04:49] your people. We're trusting, Father,
[2:04:51] that you have been delighted to be among
[2:04:54] us tonight as we have to be here with
[2:04:56] you and each other. Now, masters, we
[2:04:59] take up this special love offering it,
[2:05:01] Lord, it'll it'll certainly go. We'd
[2:05:03] like to help all of these singers,
[2:05:04] especially the ones who have come from
[2:05:06] distance, Lord. And if we can't do
[2:05:08] nothing but put gas in their car, not
[2:05:10] one of them asked for it, but Lord, we'd
[2:05:11] like to help them out. We're sure
[2:05:13] grateful for them coming. and we ask for
[2:05:16] your blessing upon this offering as we
[2:05:18] take it up in your name in the name of
[2:05:20] Jesus Christ. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[2:05:22] We're gonna have brother Tim come
[2:05:24] around. Brother Tony's going to lead us
[2:05:25] in a song as we transition to Brother
[2:05:28] Tim. You still you still good to go?
[2:05:30] Amen. Praise the Lord. Brother Tim is
[2:05:32] going to sing and testify and and
[2:05:34] preach. And he said, "Wait a minute." He
[2:05:36] said, "I thought I was preaching
[2:05:38] tomorrow." I said, "Well, you know, you
[2:05:40] know what I mean, sing, testify." I
[2:05:43] said, "Just do that. just just do that
[2:05:46] Timberette thing. And he said, "Okay, I
[2:05:48] got it." I said, "If you just do that
[2:05:50] Timberette thing." I said, "What I see
[2:05:52] anytime I'm watching you online, then
[2:05:54] we'll be plenty happy." Amen. Brother
[2:05:56] Anthony, lead us in a song. Come on,
[2:05:58] brother Tim. Amen. Transition over here.
[2:06:00] I have a maker.
[2:06:06] He formed my
[2:06:12] heart before even
[2:06:16] time
[2:06:18] began. My life was in his
[2:06:26] day. He knows my name.
[2:06:31] [Music]
[2:06:34] He knows my
[2:06:37] every
[2:06:40] thought. He sees
[2:06:44] me that
[2:06:46] falls and he hears me when I
[2:06:54] call. I have a father.
[2:06:59] [Music]
[2:07:02] He calls me his
[2:07:04] [Music]
[2:07:08] own. He'll
[2:07:10] never
[2:07:12] leave
[2:07:14] me. No matter where I
[2:07:19] go. He knows.
[2:07:26] He knows my thoughts.
[2:07:34] He sees me when I call
[2:07:40] and he hears me
[2:07:44] when I
[2:07:48] call. You may be
[2:07:51] seated. Praise the Lord. I asked brother
[2:07:55] Jason, can I get out of them, too?
[2:07:59] So now I can't play in all these chords
[2:08:02] these guys play in. I'm G, C, and D and
[2:08:05] that's it. They playing F sharp, minor,
[2:08:08] this, that, and the other. I don't know
[2:08:10] where they going.
[2:08:14] But do you love him?
[2:08:17] Let's try. We didn't try this today, but
[2:08:19] I told you how I am. Give me Genny, I'm
[2:08:22] going to sing one of your songs if
[2:08:24] that's okay with you.
[2:08:26] We've all been touched
[2:08:30] by songs we've
[2:08:34] heard. There's none had me on my
[2:08:38] face like do you know
[2:08:42] grace it's marvelous and
[2:08:46] amazing. Heard it said many different
[2:08:48] ways.
[2:08:51] Capstone's going to come
[2:08:55] forth crying
[2:08:57] [Music]
[2:08:58] grace. Oh, but have you
[2:09:03] heard rapture and
[2:09:06] [Music]
[2:09:07] grace? I'm not talking about an alter
[2:09:13] call. I'm talking of leaving this place.
[2:09:19] Only the
[2:09:22] chosen Lord's going to
[2:09:25] [Applause]
[2:09:26] take. No one's going to make
[2:09:31] it. That rapture and
[2:09:35] grace. Can you believe all the people
[2:09:39] talking saying they know the
[2:09:43] Lord? They all say he's coming soon.
[2:09:49] They believe the
[2:09:52] word. Won't it be a great
[2:09:56] disappointment? See that horrid look on
[2:09:58] their
[2:10:00] face when they realize they missed that
[2:10:04] prophet with a message of grace.
[2:10:10] Oh, but have you
[2:10:13] heard of rapture and
[2:10:18] grace? I'm not talking about an alter
[2:10:23] call. I'm talking of leaving this
[2:10:28] place. Only the
[2:10:32] chosen the Lord's going to take.
[2:10:38] No one's going to make
[2:10:40] it without rapture and
[2:10:44] grace. Oh, but have
[2:10:47] [Music]
[2:10:48] [Applause]
[2:10:49] you rapture and
[2:10:54] grace? I'm not talking about just an
[2:10:59] article. I'm talking of leaving this
[2:11:02] place.
[2:11:05] Only the
[2:11:08] chosen Lord's going to
[2:11:11] [Applause]
[2:11:12] take. No one's going to make
[2:11:16] it. Out of rapture and
[2:11:20] grace. No one's going to make
[2:11:25] it. Out of rapture and grace.
[2:11:30] [Music]
[2:11:32] [Applause]
[2:11:34] [Music]
[2:11:35] I believe that.
[2:11:38] Do you believe that? Oh, he's wonderful.
[2:11:40] Ain't he? I've got songs laid out here,
[2:11:43] but I don't never go by what's on this
[2:11:45] thing here. So, we'll just, uh, give you
[2:11:48] a couple of songs and then we'll we'll
[2:11:50] let you go eat. How about that? So, uh,
[2:11:52] but it's good to be here, man. You guys
[2:11:54] can and y'all forgive me for saying guys
[2:11:56] and gals, I'm in the South.
[2:12:00] I know they're brothers and sisters, but
[2:12:02] I'm just My wife told me the other day,
[2:12:03] she said,"Tim, you say guys and gals."
[2:12:05] She said, 'Th that's your brothers and
[2:12:06] sisters. I said, 'I know it is.' I said,
[2:12:07] 'But I'm Southern. These guys and gals
[2:12:10] can play and sing, man. Brother Man, you
[2:12:14] are so You can do it, too. I I don't
[2:12:16] even want to sing behind you,
[2:12:20] man. Man, Brother Wes is just He's got
[2:12:23] away with the anointing.
[2:12:27] And Tony, he's watching in and Jesus is
[2:12:33] going to get you,
[2:12:35] boy. He was supposed to be here with me
[2:12:38] and I was supposed to be backing him up,
[2:12:40] but he uh couldn't get him to come. It's
[2:12:43] hard to get him out of Anderson. So, but
[2:12:47] I'm here and you just have to put up
[2:12:48] with me for a couple hours and maybe an
[2:12:52] hour in the morning. Then I'll I'll go
[2:12:54] back to South Carolina.
[2:12:56] Well, I'm still in South Carolina, ain't
[2:13:00] it? I'm used to being at Happy Valley,
[2:13:03] so I still call it Happy Valley.
[2:13:06] Give me
[2:13:07] Jesus. Out on the
[2:13:10] waters, storms raging
[2:13:14] high. The waters around them were
[2:13:19] troubled that night.
[2:13:22] fear feel their hearts for they thought
[2:13:26] they would
[2:13:28] die. They failed to
[2:13:31] remember that the master was
[2:13:34] nigh and he spoke the words and the
[2:13:39] winds all stood
[2:13:42] still. Even the
[2:13:45] waters they obeyed his will.
[2:13:50] calm their storms like he will yours and
[2:13:55] mine. If I just
[2:13:58] remember that he lives deep
[2:14:02] inside. So why should you
[2:14:06] worry? Why should you
[2:14:10] fear? Very same Jesus said he stays
[2:14:15] always near. He lives in my heart and he
[2:14:21] hears me when I
[2:14:23] cry. I'll call on his
[2:14:26] name till the
[2:14:28] storm passes
[2:14:31] [Music]
[2:14:33] by. We read in the
[2:14:37] Bible where he walked with them.
[2:14:41] brought light to the darkness when the
[2:14:45] way seemed so dim. How great it would be
[2:14:51] to have his footsteps in mind just to
[2:14:55] walk with the
[2:14:57] master
[2:14:59] all the time.
[2:15:02] And when trials
[2:15:04] come and this seems so nigh, I'll call
[2:15:10] on the master. He'll be there right on
[2:15:15] time. And when sickness comes and my
[2:15:20] body heals in
[2:15:22] pain, all that I've got to do is
[2:15:27] call his name.
[2:15:30] Oh, why should you
[2:15:32] worry? Oh, why should you
[2:15:35] fear? When the very same
[2:15:39] Jesus said he sings so near, he lives in
[2:15:45] my
[2:15:46] heart and he hears me when I cry. I'll
[2:15:51] call on his
[2:15:53] name when the
[2:15:55] storm passes by.
[2:16:00] Oh, we read in the
[2:16:03] Bible how he walked with
[2:16:07] them. He brought light to the darkness
[2:16:11] when the way seemed so dim. How great it
[2:16:16] would be to have his
[2:16:19] footsteps in
[2:16:24] mind
[2:16:26] all the
[2:16:28] time. And when trials come and this
[2:16:33] seems so
[2:16:35] nice, call on the master. I know he'll
[2:16:39] get there right on time. When sickness
[2:16:45] comes and your body is in
[2:16:49] pain, all you got to do is
[2:16:53] call his
[2:16:55] name. So why should you
[2:16:59] worry? Why should church you fear? The
[2:17:03] very same Jesus said his days always
[2:17:09] near. He lives in my heart and he hears
[2:17:14] me when I cry. I'll call on his
[2:17:19] name till the
[2:17:21] storm passes
[2:17:25] by. I'm going to call on his
[2:17:30] [Music]
[2:17:33] name. Let's just call on his name.
[2:17:37] [Applause]
[2:17:40] I'm going to call on his
[2:17:46] name till the
[2:17:49] storm passes
[2:17:51] [Music]
[2:17:54] [Applause]
[2:17:58] by. Oh my.
[2:18:02] Why is it so hard
[2:18:05] to do that?
[2:18:08] Why is it so hard to call upon his name?
[2:18:11] As brother Wes said, every demon, every
[2:18:16] spirit is fighting you.
[2:18:20] He can't stand it cuz you're here.
[2:18:24] He can't stand it cuz you're sitting
[2:18:26] here. He hates it.
[2:18:31] But every one of you overcome.
[2:18:36] Every one of you, if you didn't overcome
[2:18:39] but one quarter of an inch, you
[2:18:42] overcame.
[2:18:44] People wants to overcome in boundaries
[2:18:46] and japs and leaps. It doesn't happen
[2:18:48] that way. Every now and then that's
[2:18:50] that. It does. He tells Moses, he said,
[2:18:53] "You'll take the land. You're going to
[2:18:55] get it." But brother Jason, he said,
[2:18:56] "You'll get it little by little." You
[2:18:59] know what the word little by little
[2:19:00] means? hardly even notice. They took the
[2:19:04] land and didn't even realize they was
[2:19:06] taking it.
[2:19:09] You're going to make a rapture and you
[2:19:10] don't even realize you're going to do
[2:19:12] it.
[2:19:14] Sure, we say, "Glory to God, I'm ready
[2:19:16] for the rapture. I'm going to make it.
[2:19:17] God called me. I'm elected. I'm chosen.
[2:19:19] I'm predestinated."
[2:19:21] But yet, there's still something inside
[2:19:23] of you still questions it. It's called
[2:19:26] humanity.
[2:19:28] But yet God said, "You're going to make
[2:19:30] it if you stay with my word.
[2:19:33] If you stay with this end time word, if
[2:19:37] you stay with this message,
[2:19:40] there ain't nothing out there.
[2:19:47] Where where are they going to? There's
[2:19:49] nothing out there.
[2:19:53] My
[2:19:55] why in the world would you leave this to
[2:19:58] go out there and hear nothing.
[2:20:02] [Music]
[2:20:05] Let's give him a hand clap of praise.
[2:20:08] Hallelujah.
[2:20:09] [Music]
[2:20:12] Hallelujah. I want to say I thank my two
[2:20:15] good friends here, Brother Lee, Sister
[2:20:17] Ly. They came down this morning to be in
[2:20:19] service with us. They go to church
[2:20:21] there. They live in
[2:20:23] Simpsonville. We They've been at church
[2:20:25] what, a little over a year now, brother?
[2:20:27] Something like that. And man, they are
[2:20:28] good people. And I I appreciate them
[2:20:31] being down here in service with us
[2:20:32] today. My son was supposed to been down
[2:20:34] here and uh his wife got very sick last
[2:20:38] night, so she's been in the bed two
[2:20:40] days.
[2:20:42] So, he's stuck with me.
[2:20:46] Let's try C.
[2:20:47] Yes. She was a virgin bride to
[2:20:52] be. And one night as she lay
[2:20:56] quietly, the spirit of the Lord
[2:21:00] overshadowed
[2:21:04] her. Said, "You'll conceive a
[2:21:08] child that
[2:21:10] sin cannot defile." She said, "Be it
[2:21:15] unto me according to thy
[2:21:19] word." And she kept these
[2:21:25] things and pondered them deep within her
[2:21:32] heart. She believed in
[2:21:37] God. When he said, "There's something
[2:21:41] new about to
[2:21:44] start." Oh, if that word can be
[2:21:49] born in
[2:21:51] [Music]
[2:21:53] Mary, well, it certainly can be born in
[2:21:58] you and me.
[2:22:02] Now we're that virgin bride to
[2:22:07] be saved through the blood of
[2:22:11] Calary. And in this time of darkness, we
[2:22:16] have
[2:22:17] [Music]
[2:22:18] come. We've received the
[2:22:21] vindicated
[2:22:23] word that we all have heard. And I can
[2:22:28] see it being born in you and
[2:22:34] me. Cuz we've kept these
[2:22:40] things and pondered them deep within our
[2:22:48] hearts. We stayed with the words.
[2:22:53] Ever one time feel desires
[2:22:58] to
[2:22:59] depart. Oh yes, that word can be
[2:23:05] born in
[2:23:09] Mary and it certainly can be born in you
[2:23:15] and
[2:23:16] me. Now I'm that virgin
[2:23:20] bride to be. I'm saved through the blood
[2:23:24] of
[2:23:26] Calvary. And in this time of darkness,
[2:23:30] we have
[2:23:33] come. We've received a
[2:23:36] vindicated
[2:23:38] word. Oh, the bride all has heard. And
[2:23:44] now being born in you and me.
[2:23:52] We kept these
[2:23:55] things and ponder them
[2:23:59] deep in our
[2:24:02] hearts. We've stayed with that
[2:24:06] [Applause]
[2:24:06] [Music]
[2:24:07] word. Never one time felt desires
[2:24:13] to depart.
[2:24:16] Oh yes, the word can be
[2:24:20] born in
[2:24:23] Mary. I can see it being born in you and
[2:24:30] me.
[2:24:32] Oh yes, that word can be
[2:24:37] born in
[2:24:41] Mary. I see it being born in you and
[2:24:50] [Music]
[2:24:51] [Applause]
[2:24:55] me. Oh
[2:24:57] my. Aren't you glad that it's being
[2:25:00] born?
[2:25:01] And you are producing something that the
[2:25:05] world can't produce. The church world
[2:25:08] can't produce. Can I go a step further?
[2:25:11] There'll be a lot of message churches
[2:25:13] never produce it.
[2:25:19] If you think you just you're going to be
[2:25:21] bride because you believe Brother
[2:25:22] Brandham was a prophet. Nuh-uh.
[2:25:25] The devil knows he was a prophet cuz he
[2:25:28] met him many times.
[2:25:31] Amen. Amen. He knew when he met him, he
[2:25:34] was up against something different than
[2:25:36] all these other guys. It's the same with
[2:25:39] the body of Christ. He knows when he's
[2:25:42] met a part of the bride. There's
[2:25:44] something different about her.
[2:25:47] She don't talk the way the other people
[2:25:49] talk. She don't live the way the other
[2:25:51] people live. She don't act like the
[2:25:53] world. There's something different about
[2:25:55] her. And when he meets you, he knows
[2:25:58] he's met something greater than what he
[2:26:01] is. Why? Cuz Jesus Christ, the son of
[2:26:04] God, greater is he that's in you than he
[2:26:06] that's in the world.
[2:26:11] Hallelujah.
[2:26:14] That's where we're at today.
[2:26:18] That's where we stand today.
[2:26:23] We've got we've just seen a great
[2:26:25] prophecy produced.
[2:26:28] And that's not all of it. There's a
[2:26:31] couple of more phases of that.
[2:26:34] But if that came to pass, there's not a
[2:26:37] doubt, Brother Jason, the rest of it
[2:26:39] will come to pass.
[2:26:43] Glory to God.
[2:26:47] I say, come on, Lord Jesus. Even so,
[2:26:50] Lord come.
[2:26:53] Hallelujah.
[2:26:59] Hallelujah.
[2:27:01] Glory to God.
[2:27:05] Ain't he wonderful?
[2:27:12] Oh, brother Jason, there's something
[2:27:14] about this message.
[2:27:16] There's something about the voice.
[2:27:19] As I told my church Sunday, Wednesday,
[2:27:22] there's something about the
[2:27:24] voice. When that prophet speaks,
[2:27:28] something happens.
[2:27:32] I had a brother to tell me the other
[2:27:33] day, came visit my church from Georgia.
[2:27:35] It's been several
[2:27:37] times. He said, "Brother
[2:27:40] Tim," he said, "I'll lay in the bed at
[2:27:42] night and I'll listen to Brother Brown.
[2:27:43] I'm just sat there." He says, and I hear
[2:27:44] his voice going over and over. He said,
[2:27:47] "I have a 12-year-old
[2:27:50] son." He's in the other room in his bed.
[2:27:54] He said, "If I go a night and I don't
[2:27:56] play the
[2:27:58] tape," he said, "my 12 year old boy will
[2:28:02] say,
[2:28:04] "Daddy, will you play that that Brother
[2:28:07] Brandham tape there? Just something
[2:28:09] about his voice."
[2:28:13] 12 years
[2:28:15] old. Why? There's something in it.
[2:28:20] Jesus came to earth and had a voice.
[2:28:25] Well, Jason, you should never ask me to
[2:28:26] sing and testify and sing and preach cuz
[2:28:29] I don't want to sing no more.
[2:28:34] I told my church, I said, "When Jesus
[2:28:36] came to earth, I've been preaching on
[2:28:38] the kingdom with you, Sister Lily.
[2:28:40] Brother Lee, I'm not going to preach it
[2:28:41] again because y'all done heard months of
[2:28:42] it.
[2:28:44] But but Jesus said, "The kingdom's in
[2:28:48] you." And Jesus tried to teach his
[2:28:51] disciples and his people where the
[2:28:54] kingdom was. In Matthew 6, he said,
[2:28:57] "This is when you pray. I want you to
[2:28:58] pray, Our Father, which are in heaven.
[2:29:00] Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come,
[2:29:02] thy will be done in earth as it is in
[2:29:06] heaven." Jesus comes down to the earth
[2:29:10] and Jesus walks on the earth. And if you
[2:29:12] watch Jesus, Jesus don't go forth
[2:29:14] working with his hands. He don't go
[2:29:15] forth doing this, that, and the other.
[2:29:17] But what does he do? He begins to use
[2:29:19] his voice.
[2:29:21] Amen.
[2:29:23] And he goes and here's a sick person.
[2:29:24] And he uses his voice. We find him out
[2:29:27] on the
[2:29:29] sea. They're all scared. The boat's
[2:29:31] rocking this way. Brother Jason, up and
[2:29:32] down. The the disciples are scared to
[2:29:34] death. They're so frightened. They run
[2:29:36] down there and Jesus has got his head
[2:29:38] laid up on a pillow.
[2:29:40] He's probably got one of those my
[2:29:47] pillows. Jesus, do you care that we
[2:29:54] perish? What was Jesus saying? If you go
[2:29:57] back to the scriptures, you'll find
[2:29:58] Jesus was teaching them and preaching,
[2:30:00] trying to get them to understand this is
[2:30:02] what I want y'all to do.
[2:30:04] Great.
[2:30:06] How many knows when Jesus died and
[2:30:08] resurre rose and resurrected? Jesus
[2:30:11] didn't raise with the keys to the
[2:30:13] kingdom. He rose the keys to death,
[2:30:17] hell, and the grave. He didn't have the
[2:30:19] keys to raise with them. He had done
[2:30:22] gave them to Peter. St. John 6.
[2:30:27] He done gave them to Peter. Now he's
[2:30:29] trying to teach the men and and even the
[2:30:31] women of that day that was following
[2:30:33] him. This is what I want you to do. I
[2:30:35] want you to bring what was there down
[2:30:37] upon the earth. I'm come now. I'm here
[2:30:40] now. I'm God in flesh. St. John 1:14. I
[2:30:44] am I am God himself. In him dwells the
[2:30:47] fullness of the Godhead bodily. But I
[2:30:49] want you to do what was there. So I'm
[2:30:52] here showing you what to do. That's the
[2:30:54] problem. Why don't we see that today?
[2:30:57] Amen. The bride is a different folk.
[2:31:05] And Jesus said, "I'm teaching you this."
[2:31:07] And they go to the bottom of the boat
[2:31:09] and they go get him. And he comes up
[2:31:10] there. Brother Jason, the Bible says,
[2:31:18] the Bible says that Jesus puts one foot
[2:31:21] up on the
[2:31:23] bow. Peace.
[2:31:26] And he looks at the disciples. He says,
[2:31:29] 'Oh, ye a little faith. Didn't say they
[2:31:32] didn't have no faith. It said had little
[2:31:37] [Music]
[2:31:39] faith. Brother Jason, he could have
[2:31:41] looked at them and he could have said,
[2:31:44] "Guys, what you've seen me be doing,
[2:31:47] this is what I want you to be." Why?
[2:31:49] Because he said, "My will on earth as it
[2:31:53] is in heaven." Why? Cuz now the kingdom
[2:31:56] has now made its way down through the
[2:31:58] earth. So now where is the kingdom? It's
[2:32:01] within you. Yes, sir.
[2:32:03] You have the ability to speak. You have
[2:32:06] the ability cuz you are the voice for
[2:32:08] the final age.
[2:32:11] The west where why ain't the people
[2:32:13] preaching it? Why ain't they teaching
[2:32:15] their church this?
[2:32:18] This is a going to be a part of how you
[2:32:20] get out of here with your voice. You're
[2:32:23] not going to work your way out of here.
[2:32:25] You've got to speak.
[2:32:29] [Music]
[2:32:32] I'll shut
[2:32:37] [Music]
[2:32:42] up. Sometimes I
[2:32:48] fall to my knees and pray.
[2:32:52] [Music]
[2:32:56] Come Jesus
[2:33:01] come. Let the day be the day.
[2:33:06] [Music]
[2:33:09] Sometimes I
[2:33:13] feel like I'm going to
[2:33:18] [Music]
[2:33:20] break, but I'm holding
[2:33:25] on to a hope that won't
[2:33:29] fade. Oh,
[2:33:32] hallelujah. Come Jesus, come.
[2:33:39] We've been waiting so

[2:39:54] revealed.
[2:39:56] But I believe, Brother Jason, he's
[2:39:58] coming.
[2:40:00] He's coming to get a bride. He's coming
[2:40:03] in a physical to get a bride.
[2:40:07] We'll meet him in the air. You know
[2:40:10] what's so great though, Brother said
[2:40:11] right there when he comes, that little
[2:40:13] funny feeling comes over you. He says,
[2:40:15] and he comes, he said in the grave, he
[2:40:16] said, "God will allow you for a moment
[2:40:20] of
[2:40:21] time to see your loved ones."
[2:40:25] You ever read that? Yes, sir. Brother
[2:40:27] said God will only give you a little
[2:40:29] space there to see cuz you'll wonder who
[2:40:32] made it. See, you're going you're in the
[2:40:35] transition. You're in the transition. He
[2:40:38] said when you get there, he said when
[2:40:40] you see him, brother said God don't want
[2:40:42] your mind nowhere but on him.
[2:40:49] Hallelujah.
[2:40:52] I love him. Don't you?
[2:40:57] Is that enough?
[2:41:11] [Music]
[2:41:17] You're not a God
[2:41:21] created by human
[2:41:23] hands. You're not a God
[2:41:27] dependent on any mortal man. You're not
[2:41:32] a God in
[2:41:35] need of anything that we can give by
[2:41:39] your
[2:41:40] plan. That's just the way it
[2:41:48] is. You're not a God
[2:41:53] created by human hands.
[2:41:56] You're not a God
[2:41:59] dependent on any mortal man. You're not
[2:42:04] a
[2:42:05] God in
[2:42:07] need of anything that we can give by
[2:42:11] your plan. Sing it with me. That's just
[2:42:14] the way it is.
[2:42:18] Oh, you are God
[2:42:21] alone from before time
[2:42:25] began. You are on your
[2:42:28] throne. You are God
[2:42:32] alone. And right

[2:42:39] bad you are on your
[2:42:42] throne. You are God alone.
[2:42:47] Listen now. You're the only God whose
[2:42:53] power a none can
[2:42:55] contend. You're the only God whose
[2:42:59] name and praise will never end. You're
[2:43:04] the only God who's worthy of anything
[2:43:08] that we can give by your plan. And
[2:43:13] that's just the way it is.
[2:43:15] [Music]
[2:43:18] Oh, you are God
[2:43:20] alone from before time
[2:43:24] begin. You are on your

[2:43:59] are. You're
[2:44:03] unchangeable. You're
[2:44:07] unshakeable. You're unstoppable.
[2:44:09] [Music]
[2:44:11] That's what you are. Oh, you are God

[2:44:28] are right
[2:44:30] now in the good
[2:44:34] times. You are on your own.
[2:44:38] You are God. All
[2:44:41] sing. You are
[2:44:44] God from
[2:44:48] before. You are on

[2:46:01] You are God alone.
[2:46:05] [Music]
[2:46:10] [Applause]
[2:46:11] [Music]
[2:46:16] There was a song wrote by a fellow.
[2:46:22] He was going to get on an airplane
[2:46:26] and he goes to the the airport and he
[2:46:29] has one certain plane that he charters
[2:46:33] every time he flies. So he charters the
[2:46:36] plane. He goes gets on his
[2:46:40] plane. He does his
[2:46:43] flight. He stays where he was flying
[2:46:46] from
[2:46:47] Dallas. He gets off the next week. He's
[2:46:50] got to fly it
[2:46:51] back. The plane's already
[2:46:57] chartered. So he calls them, says
[2:47:00] everything's ready to go. And they said,
[2:47:02] "Oh, Mr. Brown, sir, we're
[2:47:04] sorry." Said, "The flight that you the
[2:47:07] plane that you always charter, we made a
[2:47:11] mistake. That plane's done been
[2:47:13] chartered out. You can't get it."
[2:47:18] He didn't get mad.
[2:47:21] I'd got mad if you used to if you used
[2:47:24] that's just the way humanity is, brother
[2:47:27] Wes. And he gets mad. He just says,
[2:47:29] "Well, could you get me another flight?
[2:47:31] Get me and my crew home." So he goes
[2:47:34] gets him another flight, goes back
[2:47:37] home. During the flight of the ch plane
[2:47:40] he normally
[2:47:45] charters, his name was Payne. I can't
[2:47:47] think of his last name that chartered
[2:47:48] the plane him and his
[2:47:52] colleagues during the flight that he was
[2:47:55] supposed to be
[2:47:57] on. It goes down, kills everybody on the
[2:48:01] plane. So he goes
[2:48:03] home Jesus for me ready. He goes
[2:48:09] home. He's sitting at his
[2:48:13] piano and God gives him these words.
[2:48:17] [Music]
[2:48:20] Where would I
[2:48:24] be? You only
[2:48:29] know. I'm glad you see.
[2:48:35] Through
[2:48:36] eyes of
[2:48:38] love, I was a hopeless
[2:48:43] case, an empty
[2:48:47] place if not for grace.
[2:48:51] Hallelujah. Where would I
[2:48:55] be? You only
[2:48:59] know. I'm glad you
[2:49:03] see through eyes of love. I was a
[2:49:08] hopeless
[2:49:11] case. I was an empty
[2:49:15] place. If not for grace, I love the
[2:49:19] verse to it. I said, I thank you for the
[2:49:24] things I cannot see.
[2:49:29] You've been a
[2:49:30] shelter in the storms of life, a shield
[2:49:35] surrounding
[2:49:36] me. And I thank you for the mercy you
[2:49:44] provided. And I know you could have
[2:49:47] walked away, but you stayed a thousand
[2:49:54] times. Amazing grace.
[2:49:58] How sweet the
[2:50:01] sound. I was once
[2:50:06] lost. Oh, but now I'm found, church. I
[2:50:10] was a hopeless
[2:50:13] case. I was an empty
[2:50:17] place if not for grace.
[2:50:21] [Music]
[2:50:23] Precious
[2:50:26] Lord, lead me
[2:50:30] on. Take my
[2:50:33] hand. Just lead me
[2:50:36] on. I was a
[2:50:41] holist. I was an empty
[2:50:45] place if not for grace.
[2:50:49] [Music]
[2:50:55] Aren't you grateful for grace tonight
[2:50:58] when you didn't know? You know, we
[2:51:00] worship him, brother Jason, as he comes.
[2:51:02] We worship him. We praise him. God's
[2:51:04] been so good to us and we just worship
[2:51:07] him for all he's
[2:51:08] done. But do we ever wonder, brother,
[2:51:13] do we worship for what we don't know
[2:51:14] he's done?
[2:51:17] When that car should have hit you and it
[2:51:20] didn't.
[2:51:23] When you get sleepy and you run off the
[2:51:25] road and all of a sudden you shake
[2:51:27] yourself and you get back up and
[2:51:28] everything, that's not you.
[2:51:31] That's him.
[2:51:35] When you're coming to a red a green
[2:51:37] light and you you looking both ways to
[2:51:39] see and all of a sudden a car just flies
[2:51:42] by and you just happen to get stopped.
[2:51:44] It's his grace.
[2:51:48] None of us should be here. That's right.
[2:51:53] But if not for grace, Sister Deb,
[2:51:57] where would you be?
[2:51:59] God bless you, friends. I love you.
[2:52:00] Appreciate you. It's an honor to be here
[2:52:02] with you

[2:54:30] over the meal. Father, we thank you Lord
[2:54:33] for this wonderful, wonderful time to be
[2:54:35] in your presence. It's been such a
[2:54:38] rewarding time. Well worth all the

[2:55:02] we conclude this service. We trust,
[2:55:04] Lord, that it was a blessing to you. It
[2:55:07] was certainly a blessing to us. It
[2:55:09] brought you glory. It can never bring
[2:55:11] you enough glory, but we do our best,
[2:55:13] Lord. And so, I I ask now that you bless
[2:55:16] us as we go. And, Father, for the food
[2:55:18] that's going to be passed around, we're
[2:55:21] asking that you bless it. Bless the
[2:55:23] hands that prepared it, made it all
[2:55:24] possible. And all the people who have
[2:55:27] been working behind the scenes, Lord,
[2:55:29] for a couple of weeks now to make this
[2:55:31] possible. We thank you for it. We give
[2:55:33] you thanks for it all. Ask your blessing
[2:55:35] on it all in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.

[2:55:45] fellowship.

[2:55:51] me. Wherever I
[2:55:54] go, I'll praise him. Wherever I am, I'll

[2:56:02] love surrounds me like a
[2:56:07] sea. I'll praise the
[2:56:10] name of Jesus. Lift up the
[2:56:13] name of Jesus. For the
