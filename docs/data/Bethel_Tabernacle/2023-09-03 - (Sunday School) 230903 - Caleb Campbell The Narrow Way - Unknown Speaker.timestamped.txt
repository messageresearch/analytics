[0:14] Lord I pray for each one Lord who sit in
[0:17] the pews here today Father Lord we've
[0:19] come to receive a word from you Lord so
[0:21] I pray that you could speak to us father
[0:23] Lord get both vessels out of the way
[0:25] father Lord and just Lord help us be
[0:28] conduits for your word father we love
[0:30] you and ask all these things now we
[0:32] dedicate them now to your service in the
[0:34] name of Jesus
[0:36] amen
[0:37] amen good morning Saints let's go and
[0:39] turn into our Bibles to Matthew the
[0:41] seventh chapter Matthew 7 and we're
[0:45] going to start at verse 13.
[0:50] Matthew 7.
[0:57] verses 13.
[0:59] and 14 it says enter ye at the Straight
[1:02] Gate for wide as the gate and Broad is
[1:05] the way that lead us to destruction and
[1:08] many there will be which go in there it
[1:11] because straight is the gate and narrow
[1:14] is the way which leadeth unto life and
[1:17] few
[1:18] there be that find it if we skip on down
[1:21] to verse 21 it says
[1:23] not everyone that saith unto me Lord
[1:25] Lord shall enter into the kingdom of
[1:27] heaven but he that doeth the will of My
[1:29] Father which is in heaven many will say
[1:31] to me in that day Lord Lord have we not
[1:33] prophesied in thy name and then in thy
[1:36] name have cast out devils and in thy
[1:38] name have done many wonderful works and
[1:40] then will I profess unto them I never
[1:43] knew you depart from me ye that work
[1:45] iniquity
[1:47] we have one more just portion of
[1:49] scripture that I'm not even sure if
[1:50] we'll make it to today but I want to
[1:52] just to lay the foundation
[1:54] numbers 14.
[1:57] numbers 14 41-45 and it says and Moses
[2:01] said
[2:04] give you a second to turn there Moses uh
[2:06] numbers 14 and 41 says and Moses said
[2:09] wherefore now do ye transgress the
[2:11] Commandment of the Lord but it shall not
[2:13] Prosper go not up for the Lord is not
[2:15] among you that ye may be smitten before
[2:17] your enemies for the amalekites and the
[2:20] Canaanites are there before you and ye
[2:22] shall fall by the sword because ye are
[2:24] turned away from the Lord therefore the
[2:27] Lord will not be with you but they
[2:30] presumed to go up under the hilltop
[2:33] nevertheless the Ark of the Covenant of
[2:36] the Lord and Moses departed not out of
[2:39] the camp
[2:40] so Moses wasn't with him the prophet and
[2:43] the word of the Lord wasn't with him but
[2:44] they still decided to go then the
[2:46] amalekites came down and the Canaanites
[2:48] which dwelt in that land and smote them
[2:50] and discomforted them even unto horma
[2:53] you can take your seats this morning
[2:56] I just have a lot of material here
[2:58] before me so this will probably end up
[3:00] being two parts but Brother JD did
[3:02] schedule me twice this month so praise
[3:04] the Lord
[3:05] my subject this morning is the narrow
[3:08] way coming from the opening scripture
[3:10] there in the Book of Matthew when Jesus
[3:12] was actually preaching The Sermon on the
[3:15] Mount
[3:15] and he gave us some very vital
[3:17] directions and instructions if you want
[3:20] to hear an incredible sermon brother
[3:22] Branham picks that scripture up in 1959
[3:25] preaches a sermon titled straight As the
[3:27] gate highly recommend it it's a
[3:29] convicting sermon we're actually going
[3:31] to go through several quotes and
[3:34] scriptures this morning I hope that's
[3:35] okay
[3:36] and the sermon Investments brother
[3:39] Branham talks and picks apart when the
[3:41] Rich Young Ruler uh came to Jesus in The
[3:45] Book of Mark Mark 10 17. and when he'd
[3:48] gone forth in the way there came running
[3:49] kneeling down to him and asked him good
[3:51] Master what shall I do that I may
[3:53] inherit internal life and Jesus said
[3:55] unto him why callist thou me good there
[3:58] is none good but one and that is God
[4:02] so thou knowest the Commandments do not
[4:03] commit adultery do not kill do not steal
[4:06] do not bear false witness defraud not
[4:08] honor thy father and mother
[4:10] he answered and said to the master all
[4:12] of these I have observed from my youth
[4:14] then Jesus beholding him loved him and
[4:16] said unto him one thing thou lackest go
[4:19] thy way and sell all that thy have
[4:21] and give to the poor and thou shalt have
[4:24] Treasures in Heaven and come take up thy
[4:26] cross and follow me and it says that he
[4:29] was sad at this saying and went away
[4:31] Greed for he had great possession we're
[4:34] all familiar with that story by
[4:36] Discerning the heart of this young man
[4:37] he recognized what was missing in his
[4:40] heart his true he had Treasures on Earth
[4:42] his possessions his lifestyle was
[4:44] keeping him from moving all the way with
[4:48] with what Jesus had wanted for him in
[4:50] his life so he had a knowledge of the
[4:53] scripture he obviously followed the
[4:55] Commandments he followed them he said it
[4:57] followed him since since he was a boy
[4:59] and he had the opportunity to take the
[5:03] way with the Lord Jesus he Jesus
[5:05] discerned his heart and says look this
[5:07] is what you're missing this is the
[5:08] missing link and and why you're feeling
[5:11] this way this is it just do this just
[5:13] want this one thing and he couldn't do
[5:15] it he couldn't bring himself to do it he
[5:18] had Treasures on Earth
[5:19] and it kept him in the place that he was
[5:22] at
[5:24] and he went away grieved in his heart
[5:26] didn't make the right choice one of the
[5:28] many deceptions I believe with the
[5:30] modern gospel we hear today is making
[5:33] your way into Heaven by being a good
[5:34] person and Jesus absolutely tears that
[5:38] argument apart in that scripture he says
[5:40] that there is no good there is not one
[5:43] good and save God alone and when Jesus
[5:47] comes in the latter part of his Sermon
[5:49] on the Mount after saying that the way
[5:51] is narrow and only a few will be that
[5:54] find it Jesus because he's all-knowing
[5:57] he knew that when the time came for
[6:00] everyone to come to that great white
[6:02] throne in judgment every single person
[6:04] would have to give an account of their
[6:06] life and the things they did
[6:08] and we're with the scripture we read it
[6:11] says Lord Lord did I not prophesy in
[6:13] Your Name Lord did I not preach your
[6:15] gospel and one of the one of the
[6:18] deceptions is they'll say I you know I
[6:19] profess Christianity on Earth I said I
[6:22] was a Christian I went to church I gave
[6:24] tithes you know I lived a pretty good
[6:26] life I gave to the poor I was a pretty
[6:28] good person overall
[6:30] you know that's that's a deception I was
[6:32] a pretty good person overall there's
[6:33] there's none good no not one he would
[6:35] say to them depart from me you workers
[6:38] of iniquity because he's Discerning
[6:40] their hearts their hearts wasn't it he
[6:42] provides a way out of that life he sent
[6:44] his son he sends his word he lays it on
[6:48] you know a preacher's heart to get up on
[6:50] Sunday mornings to teach Sunday school
[6:52] to give an opportunity to find out what
[6:55] the narrow way is
[6:57] and how to escape that kind of
[6:59] Destruction yet many continue in a
[7:02] worldly lifestyle Jesus said you
[7:04] prophesied my name but your life proved
[7:07] that you wanted nothing to do with me
[7:10] because by their fruits you shall know
[7:12] them the word that word straight
[7:14] straight is the gate it's actually not
[7:16] spelled like straight it's actually
[7:18] spelled s-t-r-a-i-t which means a narrow
[7:21] passage of water and so the only way
[7:24] through this narrow passage of water is
[7:27] to be Washed by the Water of the word
[7:30] and that's the word that we have here
[7:32] the Rich Young Ruler lived a pretty good
[7:34] life I would say he probably lived a
[7:37] better life than most Christians
[7:38] Christians do today he followed all the
[7:41] Commandments of the law since he was a
[7:42] boy he was sincere but sincerity does
[7:46] not prove your obedience to the word of
[7:48] God
[7:49] he lived he lived right but he knew
[7:51] something was still missing in his heart
[7:53] there was a missing link and he wasn't
[7:55] connected to God in the way that he knew
[7:58] he should be
[8:00] and Jesus gave him that Missing Link
[8:04] he gave them the remedy the final step
[8:06] Surrender Your Life For Me live for me
[8:08] abandon your life of comfort but he was
[8:10] comfortable he couldn't come to a full
[8:12] surrender and when he comes to the end
[8:14] of his life his life the scripture and
[8:16] brother random picks us up he says he
[8:17] looked up from hell
[8:19] it said he looked up from his torment
[8:21] and he called out Father Abraham he was
[8:23] conscious of who he was and where he was
[8:26] and the incredible story The Incredible
[8:29] thing about the event in history rather
[8:31] random accounts when he sets the drum up
[8:33] doesn't say that he backslid at that
[8:36] point and just to speculate I I would
[8:38] think that he probably kept living that
[8:40] way he probably kept going to church he
[8:42] probably kept doing those kind of things
[8:43] and and after a while that conviction
[8:46] that the Lord had put on him just
[8:48] started to to die out a little bit and
[8:50] after a while of ignoring conviction
[8:52] that the Lord places on your heart it
[8:54] begins to become less and less and
[8:56] eventually it just won't be there
[8:57] anymore
[8:58] maybe he still went to church maybe he
[9:00] still professed God but when there came
[9:02] a time to show what was truly in his
[9:04] heart he denied it
[9:06] you know we can't pick and choose what
[9:09] we want to follow in God's word and
[9:11] expect to be real Christians the Bible
[9:14] said the path is narrow and few will be
[9:18] that finds it
[9:20] you know this new age I hope this is all
[9:22] right I know this is a little a little
[9:23] hard this morning but it just what the
[9:25] Lord placed on my heart the new age
[9:27] version of Christianity that expresses
[9:29] love and acceptance but doesn't condemn
[9:32] sin I'm here to declare that that is
[9:34] absolutely wrong that is not the gospel
[9:37] it is against the Bible if it's not line
[9:39] upon line and precept upon precept like
[9:42] the word says then real true born-again
[9:45] Christians should want nothing to do
[9:48] with him
[9:49] you know modern day preachers uh
[9:54] they're they're preaching this
[9:56] that's leading people to hell and
[9:58] destruction
[10:00] you know I serve I serve a holy God I've
[10:03] seen some of some of the more modern day
[10:05] preachers I was watching this excerpt
[10:06] from this video not too long ago they
[10:08] get behind a a this sacred desk which I
[10:11] I think is the most sacred desk that you
[10:13] can get behind and they preach to
[10:16] thousands where and whatever they want
[10:18] to wear they're laying on on the ground
[10:20] there's no reverence to God laying on
[10:23] the stage making the gospel a show when
[10:25] the gospel is not a show I believe that
[10:28] this gospel requires reverence there in
[10:30] the book of Isaiah when he had the
[10:32] vision of the Lord the Holy Angels had
[10:34] to cover their sinless faces to stand in
[10:37] the presence of God angels that knew no
[10:41] sin had to cover their faces to stand in
[10:43] the presence of God how much more should
[10:46] we as Sinners saved by grace give
[10:50] reverence to our holy Lord
[10:52] to respect his presence first Peter 4
[10:55] says for the time has come that judgment
[10:57] must begin at the house of God and if it
[11:00] first begin at us what shall the end of
[11:02] them be that obey not the gospel and if
[11:05] the righteous listen if the righteous
[11:07] scarcely be saved where shall the
[11:10] ungodly and The Sinner appear
[11:12] the righteous scarcely be saved my
[11:14] goodness it's a narrow way Saints and to
[11:18] even think about disrespecting him the
[11:20] way that they do sometimes and to stand
[11:23] there and express that they follow Jesus
[11:25] and then preach and teach on things that
[11:27] are an Abomination to God preach that
[11:30] same-sex marriage is allowed when it's
[11:32] against the order of God's word preach
[11:34] that living on any old way dressing in
[11:37] the old way is okay when the Bible I
[11:39] read says true believing Christians have
[11:42] a standard to uphold
[11:43] and not because they just want to or
[11:46] desire it or manufacture it it's because
[11:48] if you're truly Born Again by the spirit
[11:50] of God it's literally The Life of Christ
[11:53] Living Through you
[11:55] brother Branham says this an influence a
[11:57] powerful sermon he says even Christians
[11:59] today who claim to be Christians smoke
[12:01] and drink and cheat and found dishonest
[12:03] why it's no wonder that Christianity is
[12:05] one of its as is at it's one of its low
[12:08] Ebbs in all time it's the influence the
[12:10] church has placed upon men that hasn't
[12:13] received Christ men wants to maintain
[12:16] their testimony and then live any old
[12:18] way they want but that's the reason the
[12:20] holy spirit is a a definite must in this
[12:23] day because it is the one that lives
[12:26] your life for you you don't live it
[12:29] yourself it's Christ in you then after
[12:32] you have received the Holy Spirit and if
[12:34] he doesn't have the preeminances in your
[12:37] life then you just remember
[12:39] at the sound under anybody under the
[12:41] sound of my voice if you're not sure if
[12:43] you have the Holy Ghost just remember
[12:45] the prophet teaches if you not if you're
[12:48] not sure if he doesn't have the
[12:50] preeminence of your life you just
[12:51] remember you have not received the Holy
[12:53] Spirit because if he is in you he'll
[12:56] live his own life and you're no more of
[12:58] your own
[12:59] young young people and and anybody who
[13:02] had that question you know do I have the
[13:03] Holy Ghost here's simple instructions
[13:06] from the prophet of God if he doesn't
[13:08] have the preeminances if he is not at
[13:11] this at the Forefront of every decision
[13:14] that you make then you have not received
[13:16] the Holy Spirit
[13:17] is he preeminent in your life this
[13:20] morning
[13:21] is he more important than your job is he
[13:23] more important than your Recreation is
[13:24] he more important than your social life
[13:26] you are dead and your life is hidden God
[13:30] he says through Christ and sealed by the
[13:32] Holy Ghost so there is no way at all for
[13:35] you to be yourself no more what you were
[13:38] there's just no possible way to be your
[13:41] old self again
[13:42] if it's just profession then your
[13:45] actions and your life will declare it
[13:46] and buy your fruits that the things that
[13:49] you do by the way you act by the way you
[13:50] live they will declare whose spirit is
[13:53] living in you
[13:54] you know I've heard several times people
[13:56] in conversation say that Jesus came to
[13:58] take away our sins and had abolished the
[14:00] Old Testament laws but it did just the
[14:02] opposite of that
[14:03] or they'll say because Jesus knew that
[14:06] we couldn't be without sin that's why he
[14:07] died but that's a misuse of his grace
[14:09] and mercy it magnified those laws
[14:12] brother random says Christ came to
[14:14] magnify the law he says in 1958 the
[14:16] baptism of the Holy Ghost baptism of the
[14:18] Holy Spirit paragraph 35 he says and
[14:20] Christ came to magnify the law he said
[14:22] you've heard them say of Old Times Thou
[14:24] shalt not kill but I say unto you
[14:26] whoever is angry with his brother
[14:29] Without a Cause has killed already
[14:32] magnified it you heard him say of Old
[14:34] Times doubt shalt not commit adultery
[14:36] that was the ACT but I say unto you
[14:37] whoever looketh upon a woman to lust
[14:39] after her has committed adultery
[14:42] magnified it thousands of times Well if
[14:45] it's taken 14 generations of that to
[14:47] fade out then what about the magnifying
[14:49] glass of God is thrown on it he says
[14:53] this in Christ is the mystery of God
[14:54] revealed wearing shorts and slacks and
[14:56] those things the Bible said any woman
[14:58] that will oh you say that put on a
[14:59] garment that pertains to a man it's an
[15:01] Abomination to God filthy dirty like an
[15:04] old stinking bathroom somewhere see oh
[15:07] my the filth in God's nostrils and then
[15:09] you pray or offer up prayers and such a
[15:11] thing as that God refuses it and turns
[15:13] it away that's right well you say now
[15:15] wait a minute brother random you're
[15:16] talking about the Old Testament he is
[15:18] the same yesterday today and forever and
[15:21] it's the full revelation of God God ever
[15:24] says anything he can never change it he
[15:27] always magnifies it never changes it the
[15:29] law was magnified not changed whoever
[15:33] commits adultery shall be guilty of
[15:34] death but whosoever now magnified
[15:36] looketh upon a woman to lust after he
[15:39] never changed the Commandment he
[15:40] magnified it
[15:42] and that's moving down to paragraph 411
[15:45] he says and they would not hear it and
[15:46] they wagged their heads and walked away
[15:47] for their denominations uh-huh this is
[15:50] the refreshing see magnifying the
[15:52] Sabbath day to you sabbatarians and so
[15:54] forth Oh my he don't change he magnifies
[15:57] it and hell has spread her gates open to
[16:00] receive them my goodness by magnifying
[16:04] it he gave the Holy Ghost because it
[16:06] would seem impossible to be able to
[16:08] maintain a life like that but by magnify
[16:10] it magnifying it then he gave the Holy
[16:13] Ghost so that we could obtain a life
[16:15] that his life could keep through us the
[16:18] Old Testament had laws and but they
[16:20] didn't have they didn't have a holy
[16:22] ghost living on the inside to keep their
[16:24] sinful nature from such things they had
[16:27] experiences of God and experiences of
[16:29] the Holy Ghost but never an indwelling
[16:32] like we have access to today
[16:35] the Bible teaches us in Matthew 24
[16:39] 37-39 that as it was in the days of Noah
[16:41] then so shall it be at the coming of the
[16:43] son of man in Noah's day God gave a
[16:45] message to Noah that you are to build a
[16:48] boat with this specific wood with these
[16:49] specific dimensions and this is how you
[16:51] will be saved and he preached that
[16:53] message for 120 years and no doubt
[16:57] people started looking at Noah's boat
[16:58] and started mocking him maybe at some
[17:01] point they started to get their own
[17:02] ideas and how they would build their own
[17:03] boat you know they got their ideas maybe
[17:05] maybe Noah's wood didn't seem like the
[17:08] kind of wood that they would use so that
[17:09] maybe they're all that that's that
[17:11] doesn't make sense to use that kind of
[17:13] wood but the thing was Noah's boat it
[17:15] was that it was God constructed
[17:19] I hope these quotes are okay I love
[17:21] quotes brother Branham says in 1962 and
[17:23] the way that with people today they say
[17:25] I belong to a church I do this I do that
[17:27] but there's only one group that's God
[17:30] constructed and that's not a
[17:32] denominational construction it's a word
[17:34] Construction in Revelation of his power
[17:37] God constructed boat don't presume just
[17:41] believe God's word I don't think we'll
[17:42] have time to get into it today but he
[17:44] says in this message presuming when you
[17:47] look into numbers you know you see how
[17:49] these Israelites they presumed that God
[17:52] would go with them because God was a
[17:53] good God and and we're his people but he
[17:56] had a way in order and he said don't do
[17:58] that he gave them warning and they went
[18:00] and did it without the prophet and
[18:01] without the the Ark of the Covenant or
[18:03] without the ark and they died
[18:07] Noah constructed that vote out of a
[18:09] certain kind of wood wish we had time to
[18:10] go into it but we don't
[18:12] it's lighter than Balsa he says it's the
[18:15] lightest wood but that's the way God
[18:17] does it he just pulls them right over
[18:18] there they set their ignorant at
[18:21] jackrabbits he says
[18:22] it was
[18:24] cut from something that seems
[18:26] unreasonable but it was cut from God's
[18:28] word
[18:30] there's a whole lot of boats today and
[18:32] there's a whole lot of messages out
[18:34] there but are they cut from God's word
[18:38] are they cut from God's word are there
[18:41] critics sure there are are there
[18:42] websites websites and people who you
[18:45] know spend their precious time trying to
[18:46] get everyone to disbelieve is there
[18:48] criticism from family members about the
[18:50] way we live about the way we dress about
[18:52] the things we do or most often maybe the
[18:54] things that we don't do sure sure there
[18:56] is but we ought to thank God for those
[18:58] things because anything that is sent
[19:00] from Jesus ought to look like Jesus and
[19:03] the Jesus that I read was an outcast the
[19:06] message of Jesus was unpopular people
[19:08] who said that they were followers of
[19:10] Jehovah in the Old Testament they denied
[19:12] Jesus and his ministry and people do the
[19:15] same thing today they say that they are
[19:17] Christians they go to church but their
[19:18] life proves they don't want anything to
[19:20] do with the Jesus of the Bible the Bible
[19:22] I read is where Jesus condemns sin and
[19:25] sin for living the Bible I read says
[19:27] when Jesus started preaching Doctrine if
[19:29] you go reading the gospels that's when
[19:31] most of his disciples or when most of
[19:33] his followers stopped following him
[19:36] when I see preachers so when I see
[19:37] preachers and teachers that are on
[19:40] movements of Jesus Culture and you know
[19:42] brother Jason preached on it and brother
[19:44] JD has preached on it you know preaching
[19:47] a modern day Christianity that does not
[19:48] condemn sin you know big name preachers
[19:51] married two or three times what is their
[19:53] life produced by their fruits you know
[19:55] them but then I see a Ministry like like
[19:57] brother branham's Ministry lived a clean
[19:59] life what does his ministry demonstrate
[20:01] through message Believers Godly living
[20:03] honorable people sanctified people
[20:05] people that looked a whole lot like the
[20:07] Bible that I read about people who
[20:09] looked a whole lot like the Saints in
[20:12] the Old Testament in the New Testament
[20:13] amen Godly living
[20:17] then all the criticism all the doubt all
[20:19] all that stuff it vanishes because it's
[20:21] the whole it's the Holy Ghost producing
[20:23] those lives it's not anything that I I
[20:25] can do or manufacture it's not anything
[20:27] that we can do it's God in you it's not
[20:30] your pastor it's not your brother it's
[20:31] not your sister it's the Holy Ghost In
[20:34] You proving that
[20:36] living his life through you that looks
[20:39] to me like the Jesus of the Bible and I
[20:43] don't know about any of you this morning
[20:44] but that's who I want to identify with
[20:47] there's all kinds of identity crisis now
[20:49] going on we can you can Google things
[20:51] like that and I you know identifying as
[20:53] anything and everything but I want to
[20:55] identify with the Jesus of the Bible
[20:57] that's who I want to identify with
[21:00] glory to God there's only one boat
[21:02] that's going to get us out of here and
[21:03] that'll be a ward construction word
[21:05] constructed message sent unadulterated
[21:08] vote it'll be cut from the materials of
[21:11] the word of God it'll line up so exactly
[21:14] with what God's word says to do how it
[21:17] says to live how it says to act
[21:19] you know I've heard brother brother
[21:21] Jason preaches for years as I've grown
[21:22] up you know dying doesn't it just
[21:24] changes your Dwelling Place you don't
[21:26] die and then some more magic formula
[21:29] takes place and you're taken to heaven
[21:31] and then all of a sudden you're changed
[21:32] into a holy being your heart is pure
[21:35] you're you're living a life of of of
[21:37] Holiness under the Lord now that happens
[21:39] here we submit ourselves unto the unto
[21:42] God and the leading of God's spirit he
[21:44] comes in he clean cleanses us out now
[21:46] that of course we have mistakes and we
[21:48] fall but then we come running to the
[21:50] altar when that kind of thing happens
[21:52] because we want to be right with God
[21:53] because that Holy Ghost is living in us
[21:55] he can't live in an unclean vessel
[21:58] so we submit ourselves to the leading of
[22:01] God's spirit and then when he comes in
[22:03] he cleans us up and he makes us holy
[22:05] amen
[22:06] not by you not by anything you do but
[22:09] it's by God living in you that's what
[22:10] makes you a holy creature unto God by
[22:14] purifying now right now this is our
[22:17] purification time
[22:18] by the washing of the water of the word
[22:21] continually every single day that quote
[22:23] brother Branham says there it just I
[22:25] mean if there was ever a question in
[22:27] anybody's heart if I do I have the Holy
[22:29] Ghost it's it this instructions are
[22:32] simple does God have preeminence in
[22:34] everything you do does he have
[22:35] preeminence in the decisions you make
[22:37] and the job you choose in the places you
[22:39] go and the people that you see and the
[22:42] things that you allow into your mind in
[22:44] the entertainments of this life in the
[22:47] in in everything does he have
[22:48] preeminence would he feel comfortable
[22:50] going where you go would he feel
[22:52] comfortable being with you at all times
[22:54] do you have you know do you do you live
[22:56] a life that is that is Holy unto the
[22:58] Lord and if you don't maybe it's time to
[23:01] to re-examine what's on the inside of
[23:03] our hearts and re-examine who we're
[23:06] living for re-examine the Bible that
[23:08] that you're reading because the Bible I
[23:10] read says that there's a Holiness that
[23:12] we live under the Lord and it's not by
[23:13] what's what you do it's by what God does
[23:16] through you
[23:21] amen
[23:25] I think this is a good uh us a good
[23:28] stopping point I've got a lot a lot of
[23:30] more here this morning but
