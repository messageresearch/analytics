[38:09] minister for you
[38:11] i want to encourage each of you young
[38:13] people to look beyond just for now
[38:17] because when we minister to you we're
[38:19] actually ministering and looking into
[38:21] your positive future
[38:23] god's giving the ministry the faithful
[38:25] ministry
[38:27] an anointing
[38:28] to not speak to you just where you're at
[38:30] now but he's they're actually anointed
[38:34] to look beyond the now and preach you
[38:37] into your future
[38:39] so i encourage you just lay aside every
[38:41] way we're creating a heavenly atmosphere
[38:44] for one another god's grieving hope into
[38:47] you he's breathing faith into you
[38:50] into your future
[38:52] and that's an expected end god looks
[38:54] down the road and he doesn't see you
[38:56] crashed up or missing the rapture but he
[38:59] sees you with an expected inn full of
[39:02] full of peace and full of strength and i
[39:05] just want to say this right at the
[39:06] beginning
[39:08] everything's going to be okay
[39:11] god's got it all in control
[39:14] god's dwelling in the lives and hearts
[39:17] of
[39:18] now
[39:19] we've gone on many years in the message
[39:21] and i'm looking at many of your faces
[39:23] and i know a lot of your fathers and
[39:24] mothers
[39:26] some of your pastors have allowed you to
[39:28] come whether
[39:31] mike walls is here he drove 17 people
[39:34] here in different vehicles and
[39:37] some of your
[39:38] fathers and mothers are very dear to our
[39:41] hearts
[39:42] and little did we know
[39:44] down the road
[39:45] we'd be speaking to the children's
[39:47] children
[39:48] in the message here in south carolina
[39:52] this weekend as the children of the
[39:54] children it's been raised in the message
[39:58] the youth of yesterday
[40:01] you are their children
[40:03] you are the church of today
[40:05] so throughout this whole weekend
[40:08] we're not going to speak condescending
[40:10] to you i'm sorry that i'm up here like
[40:12] this
[40:13] we're not condescending speaking down
[40:15] but we're here to encourage you
[40:18] we're here to jump into the trenches
[40:19] with you
[40:20] we're here because we love you
[40:23] the lord jesus has been very present and
[40:25] we sense him right now standing very
[40:26] close to us we were
[40:28] just in belgium
[40:30] uh europe just a few weeks ago and
[40:32] holland in germany and spoke for young
[40:35] people that we had been with 25 years
[40:37] ago 1996
[40:39] they were just young people
[40:41] and 25 years later they're now the
[40:43] pastor pastors wife musicians trustees
[40:48] deacons as we traveled throughout europe
[40:50] it was those young men and those young
[40:52] ladies
[40:53] that were the leaders in the church
[40:55] you are not the church of tomorrow
[40:59] you are the church of today
[41:01] so it's time to rise and just before we
[41:04] turn to the scripture i thought lord

[42:11] i have a quote in front of me brother
[42:13] branham in the last year of his ministry
[42:15] in jeffersonville said
[42:17] somehow i just feel we're going
[42:20] deuteronomy chapter 6.

[42:24] ahead for us
[42:25] remember i believe i'm prophesying great
[42:28] joy
[42:29] lays ahead
[42:31] believe it
[42:32] many saddened hearts will be made
[42:35] great mysteries will be made clear

[43:39] diligently unto thy children

[43:54] my hand
[43:58] and thou should they shall be as

[44:03] and thou shalt write them upon the post
[44:05] of thy house

[45:59] house will not walk us by the way and
[46:02] when thou liest down and when thou
[46:04] risest up

[46:08] doorpost of thine house
[46:10] and upon thy gates
[46:13] that your days may be multiplied and the
[46:16] days of your children

[51:26] with the holy ghost
[51:28] somebody that has cancer has a tumor i
[51:31] think our sister

[51:38] philip stand is that true just wave your

[51:51] this is now in the first month this is

[51:56] verse 24 and the floors
[51:59] shall be full of wheat that's the word
[52:03] and the fats
[52:05] shall overflow with wine and oil that
[52:08] means the containers those things that
[52:11] are within the house of god wine and
[52:13] stimulation
[52:15] from revelation
[52:17] and oil is a type of the holy ghost that
[52:19] means in our meetings that they
[52:21] shouldn't be dead and boring and dry
[52:24] the word ought to be flowing ought to
[52:26] bring stimulation
[52:28] to young people to teenagers to people
[52:31] in their 20s there ought to be joy and
[52:33] excitement at the hearing of the word
[52:37] no we're not at a football game or a or
[52:39] a rock concert we're not shopping
[52:42] tonight and we're not in a spa we are on
[52:45] the front lines
[52:46] battling the enemy enemy but we are
[52:49] victorious
[52:50] and in that atmosphere is going to be
[52:53] stimulation it's going to be the holy
[52:55] ghost coming to young hearts
[52:57] the same experience that your mother's
[53:00] got and your father's got and your
[53:02] minister's god and i i met him in my
[53:04] motel room they love to be here tonight
[53:07] brother matthew mother jason if we would
[53:09] have had a a building for six seven
[53:11] hundred people i think there would have
[53:12] been people that would have driven and
[53:14] come here to be in these services
[53:17] but it's mostly young people
[53:20] here we are tonight almost just 400 of
[53:22] us
[53:24] god has brought us together for such a
[53:26] time as this for different churches and
[53:28] different families
[53:30] and different walks of life because he
[53:33] predestinated
[53:34] and he knows that restoration is going
[53:37] through this building right now
[53:39] the same fire of god that birth your
[53:41] parents that came maybe years ago in
[53:44] their meetings and in their services my
[53:46] wife gave her a heart to the lord in a
[53:49] meeting in new zealand when brother
[53:50] donnie reagan and brother uh harold
[53:53] gildebrandt was preaching she'd been
[53:55] raised in a christian home her father
[53:57] was a pastor but there came a certain
[54:00] day
[54:01] when the lights came on
[54:04] and we can be in the message brother
[54:05] john was raised in the branham
[54:07] tabernacle from a little boy heard the
[54:10] words of william branham
[54:14] but there had to come a day
[54:16] when the lights came on
[54:18] just a 12 year old boy a month before i
[54:21] was 13.
[54:22] they said is there anyone here that
[54:24] would like to be baptized and i raised
[54:26] my hand and i was baptized that night
[54:29] brother elliot and i have never been the
[54:31] same from that night
[54:34] i remember going back to school the next
[54:36] morning there wasn't
[54:37] pillars of fire there weren't angels but
[54:40] i just knew that something was different
[54:43] i had done what the word had asked us to
[54:45] do
[54:46] and from that time it's just been a
[54:48] growth this has been a seasons and i i
[54:51] feel i really had my word birth some
[54:54] years later as we were under the impact
[54:56] of the word of god at cloverdale bible
[54:59] ways
[55:00] and as in a little love church many
[55:02] young people and hearts had come to the
[55:05] lord and people were moving because
[55:07] there was a stir of god and there was
[55:09] life within the assembly just like i
[55:12] sense right now in these meetings i just
[55:14] feel the pulsation of the holy spirit
[55:17] it's the prayers of others that are like
[55:19] odors coming before the lord
[55:23] i believe in those prayers
[55:26] and we see in verse 12 25
[55:29] god sent in a prophecy
[55:31] of i will restore to you the years do we
[55:35] have that on the street
[55:37] i will restore
[55:40] to you the years just keep that up that
[55:42] brothers restoration this is our title
[55:46] i will restore means i'm going to bring
[55:48] back to you
[55:51] your ought to be conditioned
[55:53] i'm going to bring you back
[55:55] to where you ought to be
[55:58] let's all say restoration
[56:03] is like
[56:04] repentance or revival you've heard all
[56:08] of these phrases revival repentance
[56:10] redemption is christ bringing you out of
[56:15] but it's him taking you into
[56:18] it's two parts it's god bringing you out
[56:20] of the world out of yourself
[56:23] now 20 years ago we would have been at
[56:25] conventions and meetings and they would
[56:27] have said come out of denominations come
[56:29] out of baptist come out of catholic come
[56:31] out of pentecostal denominations most
[56:34] young people in the message don't even
[56:36] know what a denomination is
[56:38] so it's time that the ministry today
[56:40] jumped down into
[56:42] the ditches as it was and start to talk
[56:45] the language of the hearts that we can
[56:48] connect with this new generation
[56:52] to be able to say things that will
[56:53] connect with our hearts not their minds
[56:57] but in their hearts they can see that
[56:59] god's alive
[57:01] he's present
[57:03] not just by pictures or quoting but to
[57:06] be able to bring that presence so near
[57:09] that they can want what we've got
[57:12] that they can desire the god that not
[57:15] that we're pointing to but we're
[57:17] bringing him to them
[57:22] [Applause]
[57:24] so restore means to bring back it means
[57:27] to bring you back to your place that god
[57:30] had in his mind about you
[57:34] it is him coming to you at your season
[57:38] at your time
[57:41] and making it so real for you
[57:45] let's look in verse 25 and i will
[57:47] restore to you the years that the
[57:49] locusts have
[57:50] eaten the tanker worm and the
[57:51] caterpillar and the palmer and my great
[57:53] army which i sin among you
[57:58] and you shall eat in plenty verse 26.
[58:01] have you enjoyed the food here at the
[58:03] camp here is everybody doing okay
[58:06] breakfast lunch supper did y'all eat
[58:08] okay today
[58:09] half of you did y'all eat okay today
[58:12] brother john bypass those couple meals
[58:14] so i could be in better shape for you
[58:16] tonight
[58:17] but we're talking spiritually verse 26
[58:20] you shall eat in plenty
[58:22] and be satisfied
[58:24] and praise the name of the lord your god
[58:26] that hath dwell wondrously with you i
[58:29] just want to speak to you just for a
[58:31] moment has god been wonderful to you
[58:34] has god been good to you
[58:37] i mean what more can god do for us to
[58:40] get us ready to go in the rapture
[58:43] is anybody listening tonight
[58:45] what more ministry what more effects i
[58:48] mean
[58:49] some of you come from homes maybe that
[58:51] are broken or in trouble
[58:53] but i i speak for most of you you have a
[58:56] pretty good life
[59:01] it's comfortable god has met your needs
[59:06] more than enough in fact we become so
[59:08] unthankful and we take things for
[59:11] granted and i pray that in meetings like
[59:13] this god would just break that out of us
[59:15] that we would say god i acknowledge you
[59:18] and what you've done in my life
[59:20] you've worked wondrously with you and
[59:22] verse 26 says and my people shall never
[59:26] be ashamed
[59:32] my young people
[59:34] shall never be ashamed
[59:37] i'm not adding to the word i'm bringing
[59:40] vessel tabernacle youth right into it
[59:42] now there's no reason for you to be
[59:44] ashamed i have this later in my notes
[59:46] but i might as well just say it right
[59:48] now you know as ministers we deal in the
[59:50] last years or so with prayer lines and
[59:52] secret expressions when young people
[59:54] come to the front and we hear a lot
[59:56] about suicide we hear a lot about the
[59:59] spirits that would satan would try to
[1:00:01] plague the young people with in our
[1:00:04] generation pornography
[1:00:06] wrong music and wrong movies
[1:00:09] they battle fashion they battle how they
[1:00:12] look and and the perception of others
[1:00:14] they you know their nails or their looks
[1:00:16] and their face and or how they just look
[1:00:19] and it just seems like satan has put an
[1:00:21] epidemic on young people to care about
[1:00:25] how you look so much more that they lose
[1:00:28] their the appetite in that real how does
[1:00:31] god think about you
[1:00:32] but i just want to say tonight you are
[1:00:35] accepted in the beloved
[1:00:38] our sisters don't have to wear makeup or
[1:00:40] cut their hair to be beautiful
[1:00:43] [Applause]
[1:00:49] i think we just ought to knock that
[1:00:51] suicide spirit right out of the building
[1:00:54] we've been in a lot of prayer lines this
[1:00:55] last year so after this coveted pandemic
[1:00:58] has come through it's not a local thing
[1:01:00] it's a global thing i just got back from
[1:01:02] europe i had to be tested three times
[1:01:04] for that one trip two times going and
[1:01:07] one time coming i know what it's like
[1:01:08] and my wife sits back there probably
[1:01:10] more tested than anybody in this room
[1:01:12] probably without exaggeration crossing
[1:01:15] back and forth into canada to see our
[1:01:17] daughter a lot but let me tell you what
[1:01:19] friends suicide has tried to plague the
[1:01:22] young people of the message satan's
[1:01:24] trying to tell you your life is
[1:01:26] worthless or just take your life
[1:01:28] and you're no good and i'm here tonight
[1:01:30] to tell you god loves you
[1:01:32] you're accepted in the beloved
[1:01:46] life is worth living god sees beyond the
[1:01:49] now he's trying to lift up your eyes out
[1:01:51] of the dust and out of just the now that
[1:01:54] you're seeing and look above look above
[1:01:56] the now catch a vision of the word
[1:01:59] it's continuing it's passing through
[1:02:02] this building right now
[1:02:04] that's our title of restoration
[1:02:06] continues i've heard it over and over
[1:02:08] young men and even young ladies
[1:02:11] plagued with pornography and looking at
[1:02:13] things that are not right let me tell
[1:02:15] you what friends that is not an
[1:02:17] attribute of the holy spirit
[1:02:18] homosexuality
[1:02:20] lesbianism
[1:02:22] beastology whatever you satan may try to
[1:02:24] plague your mind with is not of the holy
[1:02:26] ghost
[1:02:27] and it's meetings like this we need to
[1:02:29] say it
[1:02:33] it can be right in the room and people
[1:02:34] are afraid to talk about it
[1:02:36] ministers afraid to say it
[1:02:39] and i pray god help all of us from the
[1:02:41] youngest to the oldest there's no big
[1:02:43] eyes or little you there's not a person
[1:02:45] in this service or streaming the service
[1:02:48] that's better than anybody else
[1:02:51] you might be down the road you might
[1:02:52] have traveled in the message but we need
[1:02:55] to learn to humble ourselves
[1:02:57] and knock out all that arrogancy and
[1:02:59] pride
[1:03:00] you say well i've been there done that
[1:03:01] no you haven't
[1:03:03] i just read a quote today of brother
[1:03:05] branham he said our children our sons do
[1:03:08] you know that your boys fathers have it
[1:03:11] ten times worse than you ever had
[1:03:14] that's a quote of brother branham i had
[1:03:16] it on my wall for years in my office
[1:03:19] just to always remind us
[1:03:21] as we've spoken to a lot of young people
[1:03:23] over the years
[1:03:26] they have it ten times harder than i
[1:03:28] ever did and then if you're if you have
[1:03:31] grandchildren that's 10 times 10
[1:03:34] what is it for our grandchildren i'm
[1:03:36] speaking to the children of the children
[1:03:38] in the message
[1:03:40] we have not been there we have not done
[1:03:42] that
[1:03:43] brother john stands in the pulpit
[1:03:45] tonight
[1:03:46] i've never drank i've never smoked i've
[1:03:48] never took drugs
[1:03:50] but you i'm looking in the faces of a
[1:03:52] generation that has it much harder than
[1:03:54] i ever had
[1:03:56] you're dealing with things emotionally
[1:03:58] when you're eight years old and 10 years
[1:04:00] old things that are putting blatant out
[1:04:02] there when brother john would have had
[1:04:04] to go to a store or go to a special
[1:04:06] place to look into it's at the
[1:04:08] fingertips of our children and our sons
[1:04:11] and i say god save our young people
[1:04:14] send down the holy spirit so strong in
[1:04:17] our meanings
[1:04:19] that while the water is being stirred
[1:04:30] joel chapter 1 verse 26 the last part of
[1:04:33] it says
[1:04:35] and my people shall never be ashamed
[1:04:39] verse 27 and ye shall know that i am in
[1:04:41] the midst of israel that i am the lord
[1:04:43] your god and none else and my people
[1:04:45] shall never be ashamed
[1:04:48] and this message came forth with
[1:04:50] shouting crying grace
[1:04:52] grace it's like a double portion it's
[1:04:55] like god knew that we needed not just
[1:04:58] grace we need grace grace
[1:05:00] i'm standing here on august i'm sorry
[1:05:02] october the 29th saying we need grace
[1:05:07] but we need grace grace
[1:05:09] and the message of the hour will meet in
[1:05:12] time conditions
[1:05:14] the holy spirit is standing there
[1:05:15] tonight with his sword drawn
[1:05:18] to defeat the enemies
[1:05:21] and if you feel the least tug
[1:05:23] of his spirit don't turn it away
[1:05:27] if you just feel the least little desire
[1:05:29] for god i would respond to that
[1:05:32] how many believe in miracles just raise
[1:05:34] your hand how many have a desire for
[1:05:37] more of god
[1:05:39] do you know what friends that is a
[1:05:41] miracle
[1:05:44] you all believe in miracles we just saw
[1:05:46] a lot of miracles
[1:05:48] young ladies and young men and a whole
[1:05:50] room full of people that actually want
[1:05:52] god
[1:05:57] lord we love you tonight
[1:05:59] lord jesus we want to serve you with all
[1:06:02] of our
[1:06:02] hearts yes
[1:06:05] my people shall never be ashamed verse
[1:06:08] 28 excuse me for taking this time but
[1:06:10] this is probably going to be our last
[1:06:12] scripture before we go to our sides
[1:06:14] and it shall come to pass afterward
[1:06:18] and i will pour out my spirit upon all
[1:06:20] flesh and your sons
[1:06:22] and your daughters shall prophesy
[1:06:27] how many can read that in the bible they
[1:06:29] shall prophesy
[1:06:30] not cussing not swearing
[1:06:34] not the newest movie not the latest chad
[1:06:37] they're gonna be caught up in a spirit
[1:06:39] of prophecy sons and daughters in the
[1:06:41] message your old men
[1:06:43] shall dream dreams
[1:06:45] and your young men shall see visions
[1:06:49] and it's not television or it's not
[1:06:51] gaming or it's not you too
[1:06:54] but it's a vision
[1:06:56] of the holy spirit it's god breaking
[1:06:59] through it's better than a basketball
[1:07:02] star
[1:07:03] or a football player when he takes off
[1:07:05] his helmet he's got big ear rings and
[1:07:07] tattoos all up and he's on his second or
[1:07:09] third girlfriend or wife and he's an
[1:07:11] abuser
[1:07:12] god's given us brothers and sisters in
[1:07:15] this room that love you we love one
[1:07:17] another
[1:07:26] verse 28 speaks about afterward all
[1:07:30] these things after the
[1:07:32] tanker worm locust caterpillar and
[1:07:34] palmer worm has tried to eat away after
[1:07:36] all these things i'm going to pour out
[1:07:38] my spirit in verse 29
[1:07:40] also upon the servants and upon the
[1:07:42] handmaids and in this those days will i
[1:07:45] pour out my spirit the campers the
[1:07:47] counselors the team the ministers
[1:07:50] the fathers the mothers
[1:07:52] those that would love to be here in this
[1:07:54] service but they're streaming or we'll
[1:07:56] see this service
[1:07:58] i will show verse 30 wonders in heavens
[1:08:00] and in the earth blood and fire and
[1:08:02] pillars of smoke the sun shall be turned
[1:08:04] into darkness
[1:08:06] and the moon into blood before the great
[1:08:08] and
[1:08:09] terrible day of the lord come and it
[1:08:11] shall come to pass that whosoever let's
[1:08:13] all say whosoever
[1:08:15] brother brother said that word whosoever
[1:08:18] it means you
[1:08:20] because if he would have said john or
[1:08:22] mary or susan or wesley and someone else
[1:08:26] in his name could have been wesley or
[1:08:28] susan he said whosoever
[1:08:32] shall call on the name of the lord
[1:08:36] shall be delivered this scripture is so
[1:08:39] powerful it's it's quoted again in acts
[1:08:43] chapter 2 whosoever shall call upon the
[1:08:45] name of the lord shall be saved
[1:08:48] it's quoted again in romans whosoever
[1:08:51] shall call upon the name of the lord not
[1:08:53] maybe not hope so now i'll watch you
[1:08:56] after camp for about a week or so and
[1:08:58] see if it was just an emotion no
[1:09:00] whosoever shall call upon the name of
[1:09:03] the lord
[1:09:06] i don't think you're getting it tonight
[1:09:08] shall be saved
[1:09:10] [Applause]

[1:12:02] church till it gets down into where the
[1:12:04] young people are hearing this i will
[1:12:06] restore saith the lord it moved to the
[1:12:10] microwave
[1:12:13] where you put popcorn where you put
[1:12:15] things to warm it up it was like a
[1:12:17] burden

[1:12:22] the preacher
[1:12:24] it was god changes
[1:12:27] it was god saying i'm gonna bring you
[1:12:30] back

[1:12:34] what i had in my thoughts i'm going to
[1:12:36] bring back to you and somebody caught
[1:12:38] that burden way back in this year and it
[1:12:41] begin to roll through the house i will

[1:12:48] mirrors of the house can you imagine
[1:12:51] going into your bedroom
[1:12:53] going into the bathroom
[1:12:55] seeing this promise of i will restore
[1:12:58] saith the lord
[1:13:00] here it is on the
[1:13:03] on a mirror
[1:13:07] and this isn't funny

[1:13:24] on it tomorrow night it's called
[1:13:25] spiritual
[1:13:26] contractions

[1:13:33] and they can't explain it and they can't
[1:13:35] time it it's it's just happening it's
[1:13:37] god
[1:13:38] moving saying now is the time now is the
[1:13:42] hour now is the season i put the seed
[1:13:45] there but now it's time for it to be
[1:13:47] born
[1:13:49] i will restore as a promising joel
[1:13:52] peter picked it up on the day of
[1:13:54] pentecost saying this is that
[1:13:57] now i'm bringing it up to 20 21 saying
[1:14:00] the same holy ghost was moving now
[1:14:02] globally
[1:14:05] we see it now on the refrigerator who's
[1:14:08] ever been in the refrigerator before
[1:14:10] about half of you come on everyone
[1:14:14] this is a believer's youth camp amen
[1:14:21] we want to see it
[1:14:24] we want to hear it
[1:14:26] we're going to put it before them this
[1:14:27] is fulfilling
[1:14:29] deuteronomy put it on your bed post talk
[1:14:31] about it
[1:14:32] in your uprising when you go through the
[1:14:34] house
[1:14:36] it's not all about your job it's not all
[1:14:38] about your career it's not all about
[1:14:40] your good looks can you imagine staring
[1:14:42] into a mirror
[1:14:43] every morning and saying i will restore
[1:14:45] screaming back at you
[1:14:49] you talk about the love of god
[1:14:52] it's a lot better than rock and roll
[1:14:54] music playing through the house
[1:14:57] come on young people it's a it's a lot
[1:14:58] better than a mother cursing you and
[1:15:00] telling you you're no good you're never
[1:15:02] gonna amount to nothing
[1:15:05] it's a lot better than what brother
[1:15:07] williams had to deal with in his
[1:15:09] testimony
[1:15:12] of a father standing with a gun
[1:15:16] wanting to destroy life i doubt there's
[1:15:18] a handful of people that's ever even
[1:15:21] seen a father take a gun and point it at
[1:15:23] their mother
[1:15:25] brother burly williams did
[1:15:28] we stand here as witnesses
[1:15:31] i will restore i'm going to bring you
[1:15:33] back i'm going to bring all of those
[1:15:34] hurts and all of that pain
[1:15:37] all of that brokenheartedness and all
[1:15:39] that loneliness that you've been dealing
[1:15:41] with even in this last year and a half i
[1:15:45] will restore i'm going to bring it all
[1:15:47] back to you in the same season
[1:15:58] oh it's on the refrigerators
[1:16:01] it's on the windows you kind of look out
[1:16:02] through the trees
[1:16:04] you're trying to look out the window
[1:16:05] brother jason and you see something
[1:16:07] written on the way i will restore say
[1:16:10] the lord
[1:16:13] can't get away from it
[1:16:16] you can't run from it you can't hide
[1:16:18] from it
[1:16:20] it's on the walls
[1:16:24] it's tacked up to the walls
[1:16:26] i will restore
[1:16:28] saith the lord
[1:16:30] i say god give us more houses like that
[1:16:35] that was april
[1:16:37] and may
[1:16:40] we came in june
[1:16:44] this is june the 11th
[1:16:46] 2021 on the first friday night brother
[1:16:49] john didn't know none about these signs
[1:16:51] didn't know anything about this
[1:16:52] inspiration didn't do nothing about this
[1:16:55] being written on bedpost and
[1:16:57] windows and refrigerators had no clue
[1:17:01] and the very first service we stood up
[1:17:03] on the friday night under the
[1:17:04] inspiration of the holy spirit i
[1:17:07] will restore saith the lord
[1:17:11] restored youth it was like a promise
[1:17:13] that's when i heard brother matthew give
[1:17:15] the testimony that that very scripture
[1:17:18] all the way back from february all the
[1:17:20] way april may now a visiting minister
[1:17:22] comes through
[1:17:24] in invisible vessel tabernacle and the
[1:17:27] very first inspiration is joel chapter 2
[1:17:30] 25 i will restore to you the years that
[1:17:33] the locusts have eaten the cankerworm
[1:17:35] and the caterpillar and the palmer were
[1:17:37] my great army which i sin among you i
[1:17:40] can say praise god there's a mind of the
[1:17:42] lord
[1:17:43] [Applause]
[1:17:53] just toward the end of the service i
[1:17:54] want to give another testimony about
[1:17:56] something that was happening within
[1:17:58] hours of the service this was a friday
[1:18:00] night
[1:18:01] and already in europe it was already
[1:18:03] saturday but in the saturday afternoon
[1:18:05] there was a whole new incredible thing
[1:18:07] that happened on june the 12th and i
[1:18:09] want to close with that inspiration to
[1:18:11] let you know god's working globally the
[1:18:14] very hours yes
[1:18:18] it's not just here in south carolina
[1:18:20] this weekend it is happening globally
[1:18:24] whether john can say as a minister in
[1:18:25] the last six months that we have
[1:18:27] traveled full-time evangelism around the
[1:18:30] united states and been at youth meetings
[1:18:33] and local churches and then into europe
[1:18:35] just a few weeks ago the same
[1:18:37] inspiration and the same revival
[1:18:40] and the same spirit of god that is
[1:18:42] collecting our children and our young
[1:18:44] people is in this building tonight
[1:18:49] the same atmosphere
[1:18:53] the same pulsation and desire of you
[1:18:56] reaching out and thirsting and hungry
[1:18:58] and you don't even know why
[1:19:01] it's the holy ghost
[1:19:03] restoring so what was that
[1:19:06] it caused this inspiration what was it
[1:19:09] that would cause a burden
[1:19:11] of a mother
[1:19:14] a microwave
[1:19:17] on windows
[1:19:19] on
[1:19:20] mirrors on the refrigerator
[1:19:26] near the door
[1:19:29] it's like the token it's like
[1:19:31] it's like brother john i can't get away
[1:19:33] from this there's blood
[1:19:36] all over the door
[1:19:39] you know friends this message is not a
[1:19:41] bunch of quotes and volumes and sermons
[1:19:44] this message
[1:19:45] is christ
[1:19:47] and i wonder sometimes if we're really
[1:19:49] getting our young people to christ
[1:19:55] my wife is a very wonderful believer
[1:19:58] she's very burdened i'm very happy to
[1:20:00] have her this weekend she doesn't travel
[1:20:02] with brother john very much
[1:20:05] but she wanted to come sister rachel
[1:20:09] she wanted to come in june and she
[1:20:10] wanted to be here this weekend
[1:20:14] and last night it was almost midnight
[1:20:16] we're laying in the bed and she's just
[1:20:17] burning for the young ladies
[1:20:22] we just sat back there and saw everyone
[1:20:24] coming in
[1:20:26] young lady i'll begin the week i'll be
[1:20:28] honest with you i was sitting
[1:20:30] right there on the aisle
[1:20:32] and i just began to weep
[1:20:34] as you came in
[1:20:36] as brothers begin to find their places
[1:20:38] and i
[1:20:41] i just saw how you
[1:20:44] were coming into the presence of god
[1:20:46] where the jaundice began to weep
[1:20:48] my wife at midnight just saying honey
[1:20:51] when i saw the young ladies today she
[1:20:54] where the mic took us back to our room
[1:20:56] after the morning service and
[1:20:58] sister sharon wanted to stay she wanted
[1:21:00] to be with you she wanted to be at the
[1:21:02] volleyball court at the
[1:21:04] soccer court she wanted to eat lunch she
[1:21:06] wanted to be around the young people she
[1:21:07] went on the great big swing brother
[1:21:10] and praise god
[1:21:14] she can't hardly sleep last night her
[1:21:16] arms are all achy they're all achy she
[1:21:18] says what it is finally this morning
[1:21:20] brother burley on the way to the service
[1:21:22] she said you know what i think it is
[1:21:23] it's because i was worshiping so much
[1:21:25] last night
[1:21:29] i was praising god
[1:21:31] i tell you we need more meetings like
[1:21:33] that
[1:21:35] hallelujah
[1:21:37] do you all know how the welsh revival
[1:21:38] started in wales
[1:21:42] in the early 1900s there was a bunch of

[1:23:56] preaching with you you're the church of
[1:23:58] today

[1:24:05] trustees and deacons and piano players
[1:24:08] and organ players and young men and
[1:24:10] young ladies that are on fire with god
[1:24:14] and i promise you for myself we're not
[1:24:16] going to try to stop you
[1:24:19] we're not going to be like david's old
[1:24:21] older brothers that were saying you
[1:24:22] naughty boy you naughty boy what are you
[1:24:24] doing delivering these cheeses and these
[1:24:26] breads get you back and get you back no
[1:24:29] they should have been the ones defeating
[1:24:31] the enemy
[1:24:33] i i pray god raised up more david's
[1:24:35] among us
[1:24:37] that in spite of the souls of the older
[1:24:40] people that you rise up in the humility
[1:24:43] of the anointing of god and take off the
[1:24:46] head of that
[1:24:57] there goliath be one person
[1:24:59] discourage
[1:25:01] a young person from serving the lord
[1:25:05] there shouldn't be one elder in this
[1:25:07] message speak negatively
[1:25:10] about a young person that's trying to
[1:25:12] serve the lord
[1:25:14] we're here to pick you up this weekend
[1:25:19] do something for god
[1:25:21] do all you can for god
[1:25:23] don't wait until the candles have lit
[1:25:26] when god lights your flame you move
[1:25:28] under that inspiration
[1:25:31] and have a walk with god where you don't
[1:25:33] need the roar of the crowd and the
[1:25:35] thousands cheering you on
[1:25:38] but you can stand alone
[1:25:51] this past week i was reminded
[1:25:54] by another person that
[1:25:56] is also a minister but they came out of
[1:25:58] denominations they came out of the world
[1:26:00] they came out of and they spoke about
[1:26:03] the pressures and the rejection
[1:26:05] of what they had to go through in their
[1:26:07] fathers their mothers and in the
[1:26:09] churches they attended
[1:26:11] and they talked about how people wrote
[1:26:13] them off and
[1:26:14] said
[1:26:15] wrong things about them that was from
[1:26:18] denominations into the message
[1:26:21] but as the years go by we've seen the
[1:26:23] same decline
[1:26:26] and i pray god take that spirit out of
[1:26:28] all of us tonight but we would never
[1:26:30] speak negatively or speak against
[1:26:32] another believer
[1:26:34] but we would always encourage and always
[1:26:36] be one that would say what can we do for
[1:26:39] the lord
[1:26:41] that is the spirit of the holy ghost
[1:26:44] that was the spirit on the prophet that
[1:26:46] i hear every day i hear brother branham
[1:26:48] every day and even throughout the night
[1:26:50] my wife will tell you this that was the
[1:26:52] spirit of our prophet
[1:26:54] he would always encourage he was always
[1:26:56] god what more can we do
[1:26:59] what was it in a mother
[1:27:01] that wrote this on her window
[1:27:06] why would she write
[1:27:07] and put a hole in her wall
[1:27:10] with a photo or with a picture of i will
[1:27:12] restore what was that
[1:27:18] and just a few weeks ago now i'm
[1:27:20] speaking tonight on restoration
[1:27:22] continuing this is in belgium
[1:27:26] we're young people just it was a small
[1:27:28] group from holland and
[1:27:30] almost all dutch-speaking young people
[1:27:34] i'm gonna go now into the next part of
[1:27:36] the service
[1:27:40] we had special meetings and then
[1:27:43] this is the saturday morning
[1:27:46] session
[1:27:47] are we doing okay
[1:27:50] it wasn't a service it was a time for
[1:27:52] the young people to speak and the pastor
[1:27:54] had felt led to speak about the coven 19
[1:27:58] virus in their response the young people
[1:28:01] how they had gone through these last
[1:28:04] 18 19 months the whole session was
[1:28:07] them speaking
[1:28:08] to us and sharing from their heart what
[1:28:11] they had gone through
[1:28:14] you know the first question was about
[1:28:16] the virus how this pandemic
[1:28:19] what they felt and the very first
[1:28:21] comment was we're sick of it
[1:28:25] who's been sick of it
[1:28:28] for the rest of you probably are sick i
[1:28:30] hope you're not sick with it
[1:28:33] we cast that demon far away from here
[1:28:37] i tell you meetings like this have been
[1:28:39] criticized
[1:28:40] in the last several months
[1:28:42] burdened pastors and churches have had
[1:28:44] meetings like this
[1:28:46] and then there'll be a wave of this
[1:28:48] crazy spirit try to take out assemblies
[1:28:51] that was the best place those young
[1:28:52] people could have been
[1:28:56] you put me in the presence of god any
[1:28:58] day
[1:28:59] i'll say it like david
[1:29:08] let's give david the microphone what do
[1:29:10] you think about it well a day in thy
[1:29:12] courts is better than a thousand with
[1:29:15] the wicked
[1:29:16] a thousand days is almost three years
[1:29:20] give me one day in the presence of god
[1:29:24] is better than three years
[1:29:27] with the wicked
[1:29:33] that was a young man that was anointed
[1:29:35] under the message of his day and he knew
[1:29:37] how to get away from javelins
[1:29:42] and he knew how to run and he knew where
[1:29:44] to go he was on his way to the throne
[1:29:47] he had already been prophesied over he
[1:29:49] had been born and raised and anointed by
[1:29:52] a prophet's message and nothing was
[1:29:54] going to stop him
[1:29:56] not a saul not his big brothers and not
[1:29:58] a goliath
[1:30:00] and not goliath's brothers
[1:30:04] it's time for us to raise up and know
[1:30:06] our position
[1:30:07] you're not little babies anymore
[1:30:11] young people
[1:30:12] a destiny tabernacle youth camp you're
[1:30:15] not a little baby anymore
[1:30:17] you're not a child
[1:30:21] you need to cut the apron strings with
[1:30:23] your mother and father just lean on that
[1:30:25] whatever they say whatever my pastor
[1:30:28] says it's not what do you believe
[1:30:40] and don't misunderstand i know those
[1:30:43] people that stream or will stream the
[1:30:45] service and they misunderstand and they
[1:30:47] twist and they misconstrue we're not
[1:30:49] even part of that we're of one mind and
[1:30:52] one accord lord send a restoration
[1:30:55] through the service lord
[1:30:57] may lives that are empty be healed
[1:31:02] my hearts that have been wounded be
[1:31:04] restored
[1:31:06] the lives that are empty
[1:31:08] be healed
[1:31:10] and hearts that are full let them just
[1:31:12] pour it out
[1:31:13] so that more of god can come in and
[1:31:15] maybe a little bit will just spill over
[1:31:17] the top
[1:31:19] in the book of acts people's shadows
[1:31:21] were healing the people
[1:31:24] they were having meetings where where
[1:31:26] the word was being spoken and lives are
[1:31:29] being filled with the holy ghost while
[1:31:30] they heard the word
[1:31:33] that was the type of service we had last
[1:31:35] night and that's the type of service
[1:31:37] that it ought to be more regular
[1:31:41] where we hear the word we receive the
[1:31:43] word and god infills us
[1:31:46] and for the rest of the service it's
[1:31:48] like a whole new dynamo happen it's like
[1:31:50] a ball of fire came down the pipe
[1:31:56] y'all want me to go on should we play
[1:31:58] so we got around the tables
[1:32:01] with the young people the young men and
[1:32:03] the young ladies
[1:32:05] this is the pastor speaking
[1:32:09] to them speaking about their connection
[1:32:12] the young people begin to talk about how
[1:32:14] they couldn't go to church in the last
[1:32:16] 18 19 months that they couldn't be
[1:32:19] together
[1:32:20] i've got about five or six pages of
[1:32:23] notes of their comments i'm not going to
[1:32:24] read them all but i just wanted you to
[1:32:26] know what other young people have gone
[1:32:27] through the same
[1:32:29] last months that they've gone through
[1:32:32] many of you feel the same
[1:32:36] they begin to speak about how people
[1:32:38] become separated because of
[1:32:41] this virus and how all the rules and
[1:32:44] regulations brought instability and
[1:32:46] actually brought more fear
[1:32:49] to the people
[1:32:51] they talked about how people are afraid
[1:32:53] and the difficulties
[1:32:55] about their experiences with this whole
[1:32:57] thing
[1:32:58] young people in the message begin to
[1:33:00] express for the country their feelings
[1:33:03] of fear
[1:33:05] how they couldn't go on holiday trips
[1:33:07] and they were concerned that their
[1:33:09] grandparents would be afflicted
[1:33:12] no church services no youth meetings
[1:33:17] days were long there was no school
[1:33:19] because a lot of schools were shut down
[1:33:21] and family visits were cut off and the
[1:33:24] wearing of masks and the social
[1:33:27] distancing they caught social but it's
[1:33:29] antisocial really all the distancing
[1:33:36] y'all are really quiet tonight
[1:33:39] watch how the world responds
[1:33:42] they want a distance
[1:33:44] they don't want to get further away
[1:33:46] that was exactly what satan wanted to
[1:33:48] have happened
[1:33:51] the distance
[1:33:53] they began to talk about their
[1:33:56] it just seemed like their life went on
[1:33:58] pause for a little while it was like
[1:34:00] they went on sleep mode nobody's ever
[1:34:03] heard of sleep mode like sleeping mode
[1:34:06] how they thought about things they they
[1:34:09] begin to ponder and meditate their
[1:34:10] social contacts
[1:34:13] they talked about conspiracy theories
[1:34:15] and in the politics and the scientists
[1:34:18] and people saying well follow the
[1:34:19] science and follow the politics it even
[1:34:22] crept into message pulpits
[1:34:26] people saying well if you have the holy
[1:34:28] ghost you wouldn't get the virus
[1:34:32] till it started to fit to them or
[1:34:34] someone in their church then they
[1:34:35] backtrack really fast
[1:34:37] let me tell you what that's nothing but
[1:34:38] a lie from the devil
[1:34:40] a holy ghost-filled person
[1:34:44] can get a disease
[1:34:46] can have cancer can have high blood
[1:34:49] pressure that is no indication tonight
[1:34:52] if satan is tempting you
[1:34:54] with spirits of
[1:34:56] of the world but you have you you are
[1:34:58] not a believer you are a son and you are
[1:35:01] a daughter of god and you need to shake
[1:35:03] yourself tonight
[1:35:05] just shake yourself
[1:35:09] [Music]
[1:35:14] we begin to speak about these things
[1:35:18] we talked about how they talked about
[1:35:21] streaming
[1:35:22] services versus live services and how
[1:35:27] they were taken from their live services
[1:35:29] and now being forced to stream
[1:35:32] and how they felt about that
[1:35:35] how did you all feel about that
[1:35:39] you didn't like it
[1:35:42] they talked about how
[1:35:44] being in a dedicated place of worship
[1:35:48] like a church or like meetings like this
[1:35:50] is so much more different than when
[1:35:52] you're just in your home
[1:35:57] yes we're believers at home yes we have
[1:35:59] the holy ghost yes we can raise our hand
[1:36:01] i'm not speaking about that this was
[1:36:02] young people
[1:36:04] expressing how different it was to be in
[1:36:06] live services
[1:36:08] where even where were streaming at home
[1:36:11] there was distractions and it was more
[1:36:13] comfortable they talked about being
[1:36:15] falling asleep
[1:36:18] these are supposed to be services this
[1:36:20] anointed preaching and then people are
[1:36:22] left at home and you know and then
[1:36:24] people go up to the room you say no it
[1:36:26] was just as good brother we feel closer
[1:36:28] to god now
[1:36:30] you know what friends if i was speaking
[1:36:32] to a age 40 and up group there's a lot
[1:36:35] of older ones that can maintain and
[1:36:37] maybe stream and last longer than young
[1:36:40] people can
[1:36:43] okay i'll say it amen brother john
[1:36:48] but for a family with children
[1:36:50] and young people
[1:36:54] it's not the same
[1:36:58] we need live services
[1:37:01] and yes for a season and yes for a time
[1:37:04] but there ought to be a desire to get
[1:37:05] right back into the church and
[1:37:07] get right back to the fellowship
[1:37:16] i'm speaking tonight on restoration
[1:37:19] continues if you have a local church to
[1:37:21] go to that are having services you ought
[1:37:24] to be there next sunday
[1:37:26] stop being somebody that just hangs out
[1:37:29] and using a virus for an excuse
[1:37:31] you're more safer in the presence of god
[1:37:44] young people talked about this and you
[1:37:46] know it's amazing how the same ones that
[1:37:48] were so against having live services and
[1:37:50] we need to be so careful we need to be
[1:37:52] careful you'd see them at walmart and
[1:37:54] costco and out there and they're do they
[1:37:56] gotta shop it's essential
[1:38:00] don't y'all understand we've got to fill
[1:38:01] our refrigerator
[1:38:04] we've got to have diapers we've got to
[1:38:05] have food
[1:38:10] the same ones that wouldn't come to
[1:38:12] church
[1:38:13] and wouldn't press through the unbelief
[1:38:14] and the fear
[1:38:16] that paul said gather yourself so much
[1:38:18] more as you see the day approaching
[1:38:21] they'll be just happy pushing their
[1:38:23] little buggy and rubbing shoulders with
[1:38:25] someone they don't know that person from
[1:38:26] no i know brother jason but they don't
[1:38:28] know that checkout person
[1:38:32] since when did walmart trump the
[1:38:35] presence of god
[1:38:39] costco don't meet the house of god and
[1:38:41] don't beat being in live services thank
[1:38:44] god that we can have meetings like this
[1:38:47] and if there's any person
[1:38:50] then it would even cross your mind
[1:38:53] that we have 400 people in a small
[1:38:55] little room all packed together
[1:38:58] and you're just saying well maybe
[1:39:01] colvin's going to strike them and i hope
[1:39:02] it does shame on you
[1:39:05] you're not even a believer
[1:39:07] you don't even have the holy ghost
[1:39:10] i didn't say if you think that i said if
[1:39:12] you continue to ponder like that and
[1:39:14] keep away
[1:39:16] you're not walking with the nature of
[1:39:17] the holy ghost
[1:39:19] as the manner of some are
[1:39:22] we ought to get right back in and say
[1:39:24] lord bring us back together again
[1:39:28] [Applause]
[1:39:37] they talked about how testing
[1:39:39] testing for the virus brought stress to
[1:39:41] them and i know what that's like who
[1:39:43] else knows what it's like to have a
[1:39:45] little cough have a fever do i have it
[1:39:46] do i have it or about a third of you who
[1:39:49] knows what i'm talking about and you got
[1:39:50] to get tested you got to get tested you
[1:39:52] got to quarantine you got to be away and
[1:39:54] satan will come right in and bring fear
[1:39:57] you're going to die you're going to do
[1:39:59] this
[1:40:03] brother jason demars can you stand to
[1:40:05] your feet
[1:40:06] this is a man
[1:40:08] that was in icu just a few days ago
[1:40:11] but restoration continued
[1:40:19] hallelujah
[1:40:21] let's stand and give god a standing
[1:40:23] ovation
[1:40:25] restoration
[1:40:27] continue
[1:40:30] hallelujah
[1:40:39] hallelujah
[1:40:50] you may be seated and i don't want to
[1:40:51] embarrass anyone and brother john's a
[1:40:53] minister i understand
[1:40:55] there's privileges and health privileges
[1:40:58] and you talk to a doctor you don't tell
[1:41:00] things you talk to a nurse you talk to a
[1:41:02] minister it should be private
[1:41:04] but i wonder who in this building would
[1:41:06] be at least
[1:41:07] unashamed to say i also had that covered
[1:41:10] spirit but i'm here to stand in the
[1:41:11] presence of god and say
[1:41:13] satan couldn't take me
[1:41:15] i'm here and i'm going to serve god
[1:41:17] would you stand to your feet
[1:41:19] somebody that had coven
[1:41:22] but god healed you
[1:41:24] i'm standing
[1:41:33] just look around the room
[1:41:35] well you're not standing you're not
[1:41:36] standing
[1:41:38] you know
[1:41:40] i'm standing i had covered in february
[1:41:42] of 2020.
[1:41:44] the god rich and mercy knew we needed to
[1:41:46] be standing here tonight
[1:41:48] and there's some that have gone on
[1:41:50] to their rewards but kova didn't take
[1:41:53] them
[1:41:55] i said covet didn't take them
[1:41:59] i'm sure there's somebody who already
[1:42:00] logged off of youtube a long time ago
[1:42:02] covet never took one believer
[1:42:06] god allowed them to go
[1:42:08] it was their time to go
[1:42:10] and whatever would take a believer is
[1:42:12] just lit it's just like hitching up a
[1:42:14] cart and taking you into that other
[1:42:16] dimension
[1:42:19] now friends the reason we're having
[1:42:20] services tonight is so that if you're
[1:42:23] not ready to go
[1:42:25] god would be able to give you that
[1:42:27] experience you can say i'm ready to go
[1:42:30] god bless you all that stood and those
[1:42:33] that didn't stand god

[1:42:51] restoration
[1:42:53] is what god's mind was about you what
[1:42:56] his thoughts are about you you're living
[1:42:58] you're breathing tonight to give god
[1:43:01] glory
[1:43:13] i'm just continuing about our notes
[1:43:15] about the young people in europe and
[1:43:18] at least three or four times further
[1:43:20] burley they talked about loneliness
[1:43:23] and it was a lot of the sisters actually
[1:43:26] young ladies talked about throughout the
[1:43:27] last year and a half
[1:43:29] how the loneliness and the distancing
[1:43:32] and being in your
[1:43:33] room and having to do
[1:43:35] zoom or
[1:43:36] teams or you know you couldn't go to
[1:43:38] school hardly you couldn't
[1:43:40] now you're in your room now you're at
[1:43:42] your computer and just the loneliness
[1:43:48] i'm all alone i'm i'm in this room alone
[1:43:53] young people with the holy ghost
[1:43:56] shared about how
[1:43:58] loneliness
[1:44:00] they felt alone
[1:44:06] that's when that inspiration of the holy
[1:44:08] spirit comes upon
[1:44:10] you are not alone
[1:44:15] you are not alone
[1:44:19] i'm there with you

[1:45:35] you are not alone
[1:45:39] you are not alone
[1:45:46] young people begin to speak about this
[1:45:48] and the anxious
[1:45:49] moments and the
[1:45:51] their emotion
[1:45:53] how it just seemed like this was not
[1:45:54] going to end and then it started with a
[1:45:57] wave
[1:45:59] and it was going to get better and then
[1:46:00] another wave it's like lord
[1:46:06] and it caused anxiousness
[1:46:10] and it caused fear upon good young
[1:46:12] people
[1:46:14] believers of the message they struggled
[1:46:17] with feeling anxious and nervous
[1:46:24] and the holy spirit is just pulsating
[1:46:26] there
[1:46:28] saying breathe
[1:46:30] breathe
[1:46:33] breathe

[1:47:36] earlier and you that have studied this
[1:47:38] you that are in medical know this is one
[1:47:40] of the main
[1:47:42] things about covet is take it tries to
[1:47:45] take your breath away
[1:47:48] and it'll cause your heart to just start
[1:47:50] and it'll start filling with your lungs
[1:47:52] where you cannot breathe what you from a
[1:47:54] little girl from a little boy was so

[1:48:08] with pillows it's like breathe breathe
[1:48:10] it's like this demon is trying to take
[1:48:13] my life and i remember countless times
[1:48:15] going into
[1:48:17] our hallway bed uh into the bathroom
[1:48:20] standing in front of the mirror saying
[1:48:22] satan you cannot take my life
[1:48:24] i defy you
[1:48:38] some of us just need to be encouraging
[1:48:39] one another breathe
[1:48:43] breathe young ladies
[1:48:45] young men breathe
[1:48:47] soak in this atmosphere what you feel
[1:48:50] right now if you went downtown atlanta
[1:48:53] downtown l.a tonight or downtown new
[1:48:56] york uh i just heard it the other day of
[1:48:59] someone and they saw a young lady that
[1:49:01] was just going down the street just
[1:49:04] throwing up and she's just a beautiful
[1:49:06] but she had just been marred and she's
[1:49:08] just throwing up
[1:49:12] drunk and maybe stoned out of her mind
[1:49:14] satan just taking a virtuous life and
[1:49:17] lotting it up like a piece of paper and
[1:49:19] throwing it into the corner
[1:49:23] just to hang as a trophy on some
[1:49:27] beast bill oh i got another one i got
[1:49:30] another one
[1:49:31] and satan tried to destroy you
[1:49:35] like you did peter
[1:49:37] tried to sift him like wheat
[1:49:39] and he cursed and he swore he said i
[1:49:42] don't even know the man well the way
[1:49:44] you're talking and the way you all been
[1:49:46] singing this weekend i think your
[1:49:47] message believer and peter was so upset
[1:49:50] he just cursed and he swore
[1:49:53] are y'all listening
[1:49:56] let's just fast forward
[1:49:58] 53 days okay that's thursday night
[1:50:02] friday morning he's cursing and swearing
[1:50:05] in front of a young lady
[1:50:08] one of the few times a maid and a young
[1:50:10] lady is mentioned in the bible was peter
[1:50:13] cursed and he swore
[1:50:16] thursday night and friday morning jesus
[1:50:19] died on the cross on friday and he arose
[1:50:21] on sunday
[1:50:24] i look into the faces of some of you
[1:50:26] tonight
[1:50:27] and maybe you're struggling
[1:50:32] i know a lot of your parents and a lot
[1:50:34] of your pastors and i love them dearly
[1:50:40] but sometimes we can have young ladies
[1:50:42] right around us
[1:50:46] and they're beautiful
[1:50:48] and they're lovely
[1:50:50] but they don't know the lord
[1:50:54] we can have young men that are handsome
[1:50:56] and young men that can be talking to
[1:50:59] talk and
[1:51:00] have a grandpa have a grand grandma or
[1:51:03] have a
[1:51:04] a mother or father that's a lovely
[1:51:06] believer
[1:51:08] and they can talk to you and be so
[1:51:11] wonderful
[1:51:13] but you can sense
[1:51:16] there's an emptiness there somewhere
[1:51:20] it's not the way it ought to be
[1:51:25] that's what we're groaning for tonight
[1:51:27] brother jason
[1:51:30] that's why we dedicated tonight's
[1:51:31] service to bethel tabernacle because
[1:51:34] from a womb
[1:51:35] and from a desire
[1:51:37] and from a hunger
[1:51:39] of this church
[1:51:41] came the sermon tonight
[1:51:46] god is still restoring
[1:51:49] god is still continuing
[1:51:51] god is going to save your children
[1:51:54] god is going to save your grandchildren
[1:51:56] god is going to save your friend your
[1:51:58] brother your sister someone in your
[1:52:00] cabin this weekend god is going to meet
[1:52:03] them
[1:52:15] can i continue on just a little bit
[1:52:17] these young people begin to
[1:52:19] express about
[1:52:21] what it did positively the last 18
[1:52:24] months going on 19 months
[1:52:26] how the it caused them to appreciate the
[1:52:28] times with one another
[1:52:31] and to realize
[1:52:34] what it means to miss people
[1:52:41] it's like
[1:52:42] we couldn't be together
[1:52:44] a few months ago a few weeks ago this
[1:52:46] wasn't even possible
[1:52:50] it was against the rules it was against
[1:52:52] the regulations and these young people
[1:52:54] begin to speak about how they learn to
[1:52:56] appreciate the little things
[1:53:00] that have been taken away but now once
[1:53:02] god begins to restore and bring them
[1:53:05] them back they begin to respect one
[1:53:07] another
[1:53:08] when satan wanted to bring a division
[1:53:12] they begin to be thankful it's like one
[1:53:14] said they took three steps back and they
[1:53:16] began to look at things and they became
[1:53:18] more grateful
[1:53:20] how they could give more time to one
[1:53:21] another and learn to deal with criticism
[1:53:24] and opinions of someone else that was
[1:53:26] different they was able to think deeply
[1:53:29] and be grateful for their health
[1:53:32] let me just pause in this service are we
[1:53:34] all doing okay you say you're not
[1:53:36] reading a lot of quotes you're not
[1:53:38] but friends i'm i'm right down here with
[1:53:40] you
[1:53:45] jesus is talking to you
[1:53:54] they begin to speak about how they were
[1:53:56] grateful for their health this is what
[1:53:57] uh i want every person to look around
[1:54:00] the room does anybody see any
[1:54:01] wheelchairs here
[1:54:03] any crutches

[1:54:10] straight jacket
[1:54:12] come on i'm asking you all

[1:54:19] health

[1:54:33] my health
[1:54:35] you praise him in the storm
[1:54:39] what do i do when i am all alone and i'm
[1:54:41] not with the crowd you praise him in the
[1:54:44] storm
[1:54:45] say what do i do when it seems like
[1:54:47] everything's falling everything's going
[1:54:49] negative everybody's against me you
[1:54:51] praising in the storm
[1:54:54] [Applause]
[1:55:05] i will praise you in this storm
[1:55:10] i will lift my hands
[1:55:14] cause you are who you are
[1:55:17] no matter where i get
[1:55:22] every tear i cry

[1:55:39] no my heart is torn
[1:55:43] [Music]
[1:55:45] i'll praise you in my story
[1:55:49] hallelujah
[1:55:51] [Music]
[1:56:02] we begin to speak about this
[1:56:04] with just a little group whether
[1:56:06] jason a plug or just would have been
[1:56:08] this little group over here maybe 50 70.
[1:56:12] it wasn't even a fraction of
[1:56:14] even those that are streaming tonight
[1:56:18] it's just a small little group but it
[1:56:20] gave brother john a little window
[1:56:22] to see that young people all over the
[1:56:24] globe
[1:56:26] another thing they mention is they begin
[1:56:28] to appreciate the smiles on people's
[1:56:30] faces with no more masks
[1:56:33] they discovered the smile of people
[1:56:39] i'm not against mask i'm not against
[1:56:41] that
[1:56:42] but when you take off the mask you can
[1:56:44] see the face
[1:56:46] and i think it should be 100 percent we
[1:56:48] love to see someone smile
[1:56:53] is that true i think i got about half of
[1:56:55] you with me
[1:56:59] they make you do it when you go through
[1:57:00] security it's like you got to pull down
[1:57:01] your mouth they want to see your face
[1:57:04] it's like i want to see the best part of
[1:57:06] you you don't start taking off your
[1:57:07] socks and showing your
[1:57:12] they want to see your face
[1:57:15] is that right
[1:57:16] god wants to see your face
[1:57:19] he wants to see you love him and enjoy
[1:57:21] him
[1:57:22] sometimes even in the house of god
[1:57:24] we get to a place where we become
[1:57:26] satisfied with a boring
[1:57:28] relationship with jesus
[1:57:31] and our atmosphere even in our meetings
[1:57:33] and our church in our homes can get so
[1:57:35] reckless with fighting
[1:57:39] and seeing the negative
[1:57:42] and talking about why we're heard and
[1:57:44] where we went wrong
[1:57:46] and somebody done somebody wrong song
[1:57:49] and it begins to be our theme and we
[1:57:51] need to change that tune
[1:57:54] we need to let the holy spirit come
[1:57:56] bursting through our lives young people
[1:57:59] early will i seek thee
[1:58:02] early in my youth early in my life early
[1:58:06] in the morning early
[1:58:09] amen
[1:58:10] in the morning when i rise
[1:58:14] give
[1:58:15] me
[1:58:18] amen
[1:58:28] but let me let me just tell you i'm
[1:58:30] getting into your private life in a
[1:58:31] moment what most of you the first thing
[1:58:34] you look at is a little device
[1:58:38] you're so interested you just want to
[1:58:40] know you gotta somebody might have
[1:58:42] texted me or emailed me i gotta check my
[1:58:44] instagram or my facebook i got it what

[1:58:48] game or what do we got to do and we're
[1:58:50] just so focused on that's the first
[1:58:51] thing in the morning
[1:58:53] i wonder tonight if we can just say lord
[1:58:56] jesus i want to sanctify consecrate my
[1:58:58] life to you even the devices that you
[1:59:01] have i want to seek your face first

[1:59:12] living
[1:59:13] in front of you a life
[1:59:20] and they begin to speak about this
[1:59:23] and talk about this
[1:59:26] now
[1:59:32] at the end of this session on on
[1:59:34] saturday morning
[1:59:36] the pastor felt led to turn to a certain
[1:59:38] scripture
[1:59:39] to just close it all out and this was we
[1:59:41] had friday night service
[1:59:43] this was saturday morning we had
[1:59:44] saturday night sunday morning this is
[1:59:47] saturday morning and he felt to read a
[1:59:49] scripture does anybody even want to
[1:59:50] guess what scripture it was
[1:59:55] joel
[1:59:56] chapter 2.
[1:59:59] and he read the scripture about i will
[2:00:01] restore
[2:00:03] and how in verse 28 joel 2 28 and 29
[2:00:06] where it says afterward
[2:00:09] i will pour out my spirit
[2:00:12] can you just stay with me a little bit
[2:00:13] longer
[2:00:16] after the cancun worm after the palm or
[2:00:19] after the locust has come in now and
[2:00:22] tried to destroy you afterward i will
[2:00:25] pour out my spirit
[2:00:28] it's god saying i'm going to take away
[2:00:30] the shame from my people you will never
[2:00:34] be ashamed he says it twice you will
[2:00:36] never be ashamed after all of these
[2:00:39] years after all of these months of what
[2:00:42] satan has tried to distract you it was
[2:00:44] on the news it was on the
[2:00:46] papers it was on websites it was in your
[2:00:49] schools it was in your jobs it even
[2:00:51] affected message churches
[2:00:55] this virus i'm talking about i'm closing
[2:00:57] out on this virus praise the lord
[2:01:01] but i'm talking about restoration
[2:01:03] god looks beyond all of those things and
[2:01:06] at the end he says afterwards
[2:01:10] afterwards
[2:01:12] i will read i i will
[2:01:14] pour out my spirit
[2:01:16] it's like god is gonna watch you and
[2:01:18] test you and see throughout this time
[2:01:21] and then afterwards i will pour out my
[2:01:24] spirit
[2:01:25] i say lord fulfill that scripture
[2:01:29] it was like the lord was wanting to
[2:01:30] break the chains of the enemy on the
[2:01:33] minds on the bodies and on the souls of
[2:01:36] his children
[2:01:38] and after all of these months after all
[2:01:40] of these years god was saying i
[2:01:43] will restore saith the lord
[2:01:47] [Applause]

[2:02:10] over her house please stand to her feet
[2:02:28] then it's not sister rachel alone
[2:02:31] it was a burden it was like birth pains
[2:02:33] it was like the groaning that
[2:02:36] the sisters are a reflection of the
[2:02:39] church the condition of a church
[2:02:42] is where the ladies are at
[2:02:46] it's where the young people are at i
[2:02:47] don't need to know what all of you
[2:02:49] believe but this weekend just looking
[2:02:52] into your faces brother branham said you
[2:02:54] can talk to a person for two minutes and
[2:02:57] tell whether they have the holy ghost or
[2:02:59] not
[2:03:01] and he said and you can too that's a
[2:03:03] direct quote
[2:03:05] he said i can talk to a person for two
[2:03:08] minutes and tell whether they have the
[2:03:10] holy ghost or not and you can too
[2:03:14] so we carry an atmosphere

[2:03:19] how we live our lives you say well
[2:03:21] brother john it looks like i'm just all
[2:03:23] eight away just my attitude the
[2:03:26] rebellion
[2:03:28] and god is saying it's like he
[2:03:30] overlooked all of that all the years and
[2:03:33] all the months and he's saying i'm
[2:03:35] looking beyond all of that and i'm
[2:03:37] saying i will restore saith the lord my

[2:04:35] being an overcomer and saying it's well
[2:04:37] this is this or it's that or i'm the
[2:04:40] only young person in my church or i'm
[2:04:42] the only one that is wanting to serve
[2:04:44] god in my family or i'm the only young
[2:04:46] person that's stronger or this or that
[2:04:49] that's called a victim
[2:04:51] and you need to stop waving that before
[2:04:53] the lord tonight you need to wave your
[2:04:56] heart before the lord of praise and of
[2:04:59] worship
[2:05:02] said i give you my life i give you my
[2:05:04] praise
[2:05:05] [Applause]
[2:05:19] and tomorrow night we're going to speak
[2:05:20] more along this line but right at the
[2:05:23] end of all of this
[2:05:25] god gives you a feast
[2:05:28] october to the jews
[2:05:31] is the month of the feast of tabernacles
[2:05:33] i'm going to speak on that tomorrow
[2:05:35] night
[2:05:36] i'm going to feast of speak about
[2:05:39] spiritual contractions
[2:05:41] in your booth a booth
[2:05:43] was what they were called to make
[2:05:46] before the feast of the tabernacles
[2:05:48] which was private it was small it was
[2:05:50] crude it was temporary but they were
[2:05:53] called to go into their individual booth
[2:05:56] it was it speaks of consecration it
[2:05:59] speaks of dedication we're going to read
[2:06:01] out leviticus and nehemiah when ezra
[2:06:04] stood up to read this in the book of
[2:06:06] nehemiah about we are to have booths
[2:06:10] the bible says they had not practiced
[2:06:12] that since the days of joshua
[2:06:15] which was 1 000 years
[2:06:20] the message had
[2:06:22] neglected personal consecration
[2:06:26] and dedication
[2:06:28] and they wanted a revival they wanted
[2:06:30] the feast but they had neglected the
[2:06:33] booth
[2:06:35] so tomorrow night i want to bring that
[2:06:37] out the spiritual contractions in your
[2:06:40] booth
[2:06:41] it's got to be personal it's got to be
[2:06:43] individual it's your consecration
[2:06:47] if you want to go on with god
[2:06:50] there has to be a start
[2:06:56] friends deliverance how many has ever
[2:06:59] seen someone delivered or been delivered
[2:07:01] it happens like it can happen in a
[2:07:02] moment
[2:07:04] do we believe in that it's like
[2:07:10] deliverance is like a miracle can be
[2:07:13] instant but restoration
[2:07:15] is a process
[2:07:18] that's what i'm speaking on tonight
[2:07:20] it takes time
[2:07:22] and i believe i think all of us believe
[2:07:25] in a spontaneous
[2:07:26] dynamic and feeling of the holy ghost
[2:07:30] every person that goes in the rapture
[2:07:32] the bride will receive a holy ghost
[2:07:35] revival
[2:07:36] do we believe that
[2:07:38] any any believer should embrace the
[2:07:41] power of the holy ghost if you're
[2:07:43] leaning toward being formal and
[2:07:45] indifferent
[2:07:50] well i'll let you finish it
[2:07:53] we need to run tonight to jesus christ
[2:07:56] i was thinking tonight about how
[2:07:57] precious it is that we can have meetings
[2:08:00] like this
[2:08:02] to be around people that actually love
[2:08:03] you that are cheering you on
[2:08:07] but someone's giving you the baton
[2:08:09] saying take it
[2:08:11] take it
[2:08:13] take it
[2:08:16] i'm not saying give me that microphone
[2:08:18] give me that bro who do you think you
[2:08:19] are take
[2:08:20] it
[2:08:22] run
[2:08:24] go
[2:08:28] that's the
[2:08:30] thus saith the lord to the bride
[2:08:34] so as we close tonight i wanted you to
[2:08:36] see that restoration takes time
[2:08:41] on these photos i'm going to show you
[2:08:43] this this doesn't take five minutes 10
[2:08:46] minutes
[2:08:46] 30 minutes
[2:08:48] it takes time
[2:08:51] a miracle's instant a deliverance can
[2:08:53] happen like that but when you get up
[2:08:55] from the altar when you go back to
[2:08:57] school that's when restoration has to
[2:08:59] continue
[2:09:05] look at this
[2:09:06] how many's ever seen restoration of a
[2:09:08] building before it doesn't happen in a
[2:09:10] week or a weekend
[2:09:12] see this is where the ministries got to
[2:09:14] realize that it's not a momentary
[2:09:16] blessing it's not just just the
[2:09:19] momentary blessing we're trying to get
[2:09:21] the young people to it's the eternal
[2:09:24] deposit that will last far beyond this
[2:09:27] week
[2:09:29] we're trying to get you to love him
[2:09:40] everybody wants to you know go out on
[2:09:42] friday night take drugs drink it up have
[2:09:45] a good time go to a sex party yeah we
[2:09:48] had a great time that's that's what the
[2:09:50] world does
[2:09:53] god forbid we bring that into the
[2:09:54] message
[2:09:56] just try to bring in you know just
[2:09:57] momentary blessings and momentary
[2:09:59] impulses and everybody amen that down on
[2:10:02] monday down i'm speaking to you next
[2:10:04] thursday
[2:10:06] i'm talking to you about next friday
[2:10:08] night
[2:10:10] restoration
[2:10:12] continues and i pray it continues for
[2:10:15] every person
[2:10:17] that you would catch that revelation
[2:10:20] i need that experience i need but i also
[2:10:23] need to go on from there
[2:10:30] look at this i mean it takes more than
[2:10:32] a few days to put the scaffolding up for
[2:10:35] the cadre look at this
[2:10:36] they're trying to this uh put you know
[2:10:39] roof on around this old clock and this
[2:10:41] little just putting the scaffolding up
[2:10:43] takes days and days
[2:10:46] people aren't willing to do that in the
[2:10:47] message
[2:10:50] they want a momentary hit give me
[2:10:52] something fast that's what you did in
[2:10:54] the
[2:10:54] world that's what the parents did and
[2:10:57] the elders did in the world
[2:11:02] i pray that we lay something into our
[2:11:04] young people that long after these
[2:11:06] lights are off and long after we've all
[2:11:09] gone home sunday and monday there's been
[2:11:12] something left in your heart
[2:11:15] i will go on
[2:11:16] i will go on
[2:11:19] i must go on
[2:11:22] [Applause]
[2:11:29] press one
[2:11:44] i just feel like the angel of the lord
[2:11:46] is here right now
[2:11:49] as you have your seats what i'm speaking
[2:11:51] about is beyond emotion
[2:11:54] but it includes emotion
[2:11:58] i know you are being seated so i don't
[2:12:00] want someone to on the internet to have
[2:12:03] a little blip there like we did at the
[2:12:04] beginning of the service and say is it
[2:12:06] buffering that's everything's common
[2:12:08] everybody's doing fine here is everybody
[2:12:09] doing fine
[2:12:12] what i'm speaking about is beyond
[2:12:13] emotion but it includes emotion in fact
[2:12:16] i pray god give us a double portion
[2:12:19] god give us more young ladies that'll
[2:12:21] stand up and say lord i love you with
[2:12:23] all of my heart
[2:12:25] [Applause]
[2:12:36] let's just get something very clear
[2:12:38] because
[2:12:38] we have older ones here also
[2:12:41] older people don't have it all together
[2:12:43] either
[2:12:46] we hear sermons about god's will and
[2:12:48] god's purpose and you got to find it you
[2:12:49] got to know for certain and all these
[2:12:51] things there's a lot of older people
[2:12:53] that are still trying to find god's will
[2:12:55] for their life and
[2:12:56] what job and where we should go when
[2:12:58] should we move to this
[2:13:00] they're making decisions and they're
[2:13:01] groaning what should we do lord what
[2:13:03] should we do so are our young people
[2:13:10] so we need to remove the facade
[2:13:13] it's called
[2:13:14] hypocrisy that puts out this strong
[2:13:17] image i've got it all together
[2:13:21] no you don't have it all together
[2:13:23] even the older ones we we're just one
[2:13:25] breath away
[2:13:27] we're just one breath away just talk to
[2:13:30] our miracle here brother there's just
[2:13:31] one breath away from going into that
[2:13:33] other side
[2:13:37] you talk about torment
[2:13:39] and most of you heard the testimony
[2:13:42] you talk about the anxiety you talk
[2:13:43] about a man sitting right over here that
[2:13:45] has the holy ghost
[2:13:47] that was tormented
[2:13:50] didn't even know if he was going to live
[2:13:52] to see sister amy or his family
[2:13:55] so if an older person brother matthew do
[2:13:57] you ever grown to find the will of god
[2:13:59] for your life
[2:14:01] is that yes oh my yes
[2:14:05] i'm trying to work with you brother
[2:14:10] brother brother cadre i mean
[2:14:15] okay brother burley
[2:14:19] he was quick he knew he
[2:14:22] brother jason
[2:14:23] do you pray for god's will and
[2:14:27] then why do we look down on our young
[2:14:29] people why do we speak so condescending
[2:14:32] to them they're trying to find their way
[2:14:37] sometimes even our church services we
[2:14:39] can make one another so nervous and it's
[2:14:41] like we have to conform it's like we
[2:14:43] have to be spiritual it's like we have
[2:14:45] to oh
[2:14:46] and i'm not
[2:14:48] i'm not saying that's bad but i'm just
[2:14:50] saying we can make one another feel like
[2:14:54] yeah yeah yeah and really it's like
[2:14:56] they're groaning
[2:15:01] if you read the book of judges right
[2:15:02] after joshua it says after joshua and
[2:15:05] caleb and the generation that was with
[2:15:07] them passed away there rose up another
[2:15:09] generation that did not know the lord
[2:15:12] we're living in that generation
[2:15:14] being around the message and saying
[2:15:16] brother branham was a prophet and having
[2:15:18] good this and that and having good music
[2:15:20] is wonderful
[2:15:22] my wife loves your music i love it too
[2:15:25] she said it going home in the car last
[2:15:27] night i think i love their loud music
[2:15:30] i loved your loud music
[2:15:32] play it louder brother aaron hey man
[2:15:35] sister deb
[2:15:38] we're not at a funeral
[2:15:40] and this is a youth camp by the way
[2:15:48] it's beyond intellect
[2:15:51] but i encourage every person here
[2:15:52] tonight
[2:15:54] to receive the holy ghost
[2:16:04] when you look at this time of disaster
[2:16:06] and i'm coming down to the end here
[2:16:08] tornadoes damage comes snow
[2:16:11] begins to bring damage to a situation to
[2:16:13] a family to a life
[2:16:15] flooding fire
[2:16:17] maybe a business or your personal world
[2:16:19] just gets turned upside down
[2:16:26] sometimes you just need to take a step
[2:16:28] back
[2:16:29] and recover
[2:16:35] lord restore us
[2:16:39] i'm just praying right now how to close
[2:16:41] the service
[2:16:44] but i pray that the lord brother yawns
[2:16:46] answers this prayer
[2:16:49] lord restore all of our young people
[2:16:53] restore their minds
[2:16:55] in the name of jesus christ
[2:16:57] may every wondering spirit be brought
[2:17:00] back into the right to be placed
[2:17:03] i'm standing here as a minister of the
[2:17:05] gospel
[2:17:07] may every spirit of our young ladies
[2:17:10] that has somehow wandered out there into
[2:17:12] a world
[2:17:15] and you're thinking things and you're
[2:17:17] going places it's not even real
[2:17:20] it's time for you to come back tonight
[2:17:24] and in the name of jesus christ
[2:17:26] we're coming after you
[2:17:28] there's any of our young men that are
[2:17:30] totally it's almost like they've gone
[2:17:32] insane it's almost like you look into
[2:17:33] their face
[2:17:36] and their eyes are just
[2:17:39] it's wandering eyes searching eyes it's
[2:17:42] looking eyes
[2:17:45] and you know
[2:17:48] if the rapture was tonight or tomorrow
[2:17:50] they would not go you know you sensed
[2:17:52] that
[2:17:54] and i wonder sometimes where is the holy
[2:17:57] ghost conviction in our meetings anymore
[2:17:59] where's our burden from one another
[2:18:06] i dedicated the service to bethel
[2:18:07] tabernacle and i told my wife driving
[2:18:10] home last night about this church i said
[2:18:13] the main thing i appreciate about them
[2:18:15] is they are real
[2:18:18] maybe it was when we got into our motel
[2:18:20] room i said they're real
[2:18:25] what you see
[2:18:27] is what it is there's not a big facade
[2:18:29] there's there's not a bunch of people
[2:18:31] playing the instruments for
[2:18:32] for fame there's not people grabbing the
[2:18:34] microphone and just trying to be on the
[2:18:37] next youtube
[2:18:40] channel
[2:18:40] splice
[2:18:43] vessel tabernacle god has honored you
[2:18:47] and blessed you because of your desire
[2:18:53] and i thank you
[2:18:55] for inviting all of us into this
[2:18:56] atmosphere
[2:18:59] that we could be healed
[2:19:05] and when i tried to find some photos of
[2:19:07] restoration you can look on the pictures
[2:19:10] here quickly i'll go through these this
[2:19:12] doesn't take five minutes it doesn't
[2:19:14] take 30 minutes it's not when you go
[2:19:15] back to your cabin and then no you gotta
[2:19:17] there's
[2:19:18] holy ghost effort there's
[2:19:20] i'm not calling it works i'm calling
[2:19:22] about the nature of the holy spirit in a
[2:19:25] person
[2:19:26] is willing to stick to it
[2:19:30] when the music fades
[2:19:32] i still love the lord
[2:19:35] when the preachers are gone and they're
[2:19:38] and the way that they preach
[2:19:40] and the anointing that's on them
[2:19:43] but brother john's got to get an
[2:19:44] airplane monday morning at six o'clock
[2:19:47] with my wife
[2:19:48] and we've got to go back to another life
[2:19:51] too
[2:19:52] and it's not always easy
[2:19:55] and you don't always have everybody in
[2:19:57] the stands cheering you on and saying
[2:19:59] god bless you and patting you on the
[2:20:01] back
[2:20:02] but you and i've got to know
[2:20:05] that god is with us
[2:20:07] and like moses said unless god go not up
[2:20:10] with us we don't want to go if your
[2:20:12] presence don't go we don't want to
[2:20:14] go i encourage you to pray about it
[2:20:18] get counsel about it
[2:20:22] and pray a little more
[2:20:24] and then wait a little more
[2:20:26] and make sure you're neutral
[2:20:30] but when god speaks and when god says
[2:20:33] now is the time
[2:20:34] don't be a coward
[2:20:41] next thursday at your work or at school
[2:20:44] someone just puts it out there
[2:20:46] don't be a coward
[2:20:50] let the holy spirit strengthen you
[2:20:52] tonight and say
[2:20:53] i'm ready to go back into the lions
[2:20:56] but lord you promised you'd never leave
[2:20:58] me never forsake me
[2:21:00] do you have the time
[2:21:02] for restoration
[2:21:04] amen
[2:21:05] here it is you can look at it
[2:21:10] before and after photos i know you can't
[2:21:12] hardly see that but
[2:21:20] you see this up here on the left
[2:21:23] you that are streaming it's on the top
[2:21:24] left that's not fifty thousand hundred
[2:21:27] thousand that's millions of dollars of
[2:21:29] restoration
[2:21:31] and if the world can pour that into a
[2:21:33] building
[2:21:35] if an investor can pour that in and have
[2:21:37] a vision
[2:21:39] are you getting it
[2:21:41] somebody in the world can say i'm going
[2:21:43] to turn this
[2:21:44] into that this is a before this is an
[2:21:47] after what the power of god can do in
[2:21:50] your life
[2:22:06] where are you tonight
[2:22:09] there might be weeds growing up there
[2:22:10] might be cracked windows there might be
[2:22:13] all kinds of things look at this in
[2:22:15] 1948 on the left-hand side in new york
[2:22:18] city there was a a certain house you can
[2:22:21] see it there the astoria then as time
[2:22:23] went on it digressed in the middle you
[2:22:26] can see the boarded up windows and the
[2:22:28] horrible it just decayed
[2:22:31] but on the right hand side you can see
[2:22:33] after restoration
[2:22:35] what can happen when somebody's willing
[2:22:37] to pour in the time pouring the money
[2:22:39] i'm making an investment
[2:22:42] i tell you what friends all heaven is
[2:22:44] here to back you up tonight
[2:22:56] some of you that are in the cars look at
[2:22:58] this
[2:22:59] on the left-hand side there's rust and
[2:23:02] there's all kinds of
[2:23:03] just it looks horrible you wouldn't want
[2:23:05] to drive that car but on the right hand
[2:23:07] side
[2:23:08] you see the tires you see the paint it's
[2:23:10] been restored
[2:23:12] spiritually if they can do that to an
[2:23:14] automobile what can god do in your life
[2:23:27] i just say lord place your hand upon my
[2:23:30] life
[2:23:33] god's got all eternity so he's not
[2:23:35] rushing it
[2:23:37] and there's not one person that's going
[2:23:39] to miss the rapture
[2:23:40] that was supposed to be there
[2:23:44] so you just need to tonight stop letting
[2:23:46] the devil push you to the brink
[2:23:51] where you're almost losing your mind
[2:23:54] and you feel so nervous and upset
[2:23:59] and he's telling you you don't have the
[2:24:00] holy ghost
[2:24:03] there's not been anything good happened
[2:24:05] to you as a fake
[2:24:07] and you're missing out on life
[2:24:11] after tonight you ought to just turn
[2:24:12] that around and say he's still working
[2:24:15] on me
[2:24:20] i might not be where i ought to be
[2:24:23] but god's not finished with me yet
[2:24:35] on the left hand side you can see the
[2:24:37] outside of this
[2:24:38] house this condo
[2:24:41] but after some renovations and
[2:24:42] restoration look on the right hand side
[2:24:44] who likes it on the right hand side who
[2:24:46] likes that okay
[2:24:47] all the sisters okay
[2:24:50] who likes it on the right hand side who
[2:24:51] would like that
[2:24:53] half of you
[2:24:55] because who wants to live on the
[2:24:56] left-hand side and that's how
[2:24:58] oh you do
[2:25:00] you're brave you're brave
[2:25:02] she's humble
[2:25:04] okay brothers if you married a fine
[2:25:06] young lady
[2:25:09] and you had the opportunity of the one
[2:25:11] on the left or the one on the right
[2:25:12] which would you want to move her into
[2:25:16] wow
[2:25:19] can i have your
[2:25:22] number you don't want to give me your
[2:25:24] number it's
[2:25:26] yeah i won't go there
[2:25:30] this is from the inside i mean you're
[2:25:32] looking out from this room it's fine
[2:25:38] on the right hand side it's the same
[2:25:39] room it's the same person it's the same
[2:25:41] situation it's just
[2:25:43] someone was able to take it into their
[2:25:46] control
[2:25:48] and when they got done with it
[2:25:50] it became a place that you'd want to
[2:25:52] live in
[2:25:53] and by the way that's not a television
[2:25:55] over there that's a monitor
[2:26:04] i had to say it i mean
[2:26:07] i didn't have time to edit it out and i
[2:26:09] saw that
[2:26:10] it's not a gaming board that's
[2:26:13] for you to stream some good services
[2:26:14] from happy valley or
[2:26:17] bethel tabernacle or
[2:26:20] i think you all got that amen
[2:26:24] so tonight
[2:26:26] god has brought all of us now from this
[2:26:29] year to october the 29th
[2:26:32] here we are
[2:26:34] and this is what brother branham said
[2:26:36] in the church age book why does he stand
[2:26:39] by
[2:26:41] and he begins to quote romans 8 17 about
[2:26:44] it for children and heirs heirs of god
[2:26:46] and heirs with christ if so be that we
[2:26:48] suffer with him we may be also glorified
[2:26:50] together for i reckon that the
[2:26:52] sufferings of this present time are not
[2:26:54] worthy
[2:26:56] to be compared with the glory which
[2:26:58] shall be revealed in us
[2:27:01] putting on a scale of life it's not
[2:27:03] worthy
[2:27:04] to be compared
[2:27:06] your suffering or what you've gone
[2:27:08] through with the glory of god
[2:27:12] unless we suffer with him we cannot
[2:27:14] reign with him you have to suffer to
[2:27:16] reign
[2:27:18] the reason for this is that character
[2:27:19] simply is never made without suffering
[2:27:22] character
[2:27:23] is a victory
[2:27:26] not a gift
[2:27:28] and if we had another hour which we
[2:27:30] don't this needs to be preached on more
[2:27:33] when you come to an altar when you
[2:27:35] you could be in your own bedroom and
[2:27:37] receive the holy ghost
[2:27:40] god gives you the gift of the holy ghost
[2:27:43] but character is a victory
[2:27:45] did everybody get that
[2:27:47] you got to walk out of that experience
[2:27:49] and continue to fight and go forward
[2:27:51] characters of victory not a gift
[2:27:54] and that's why a person a man without
[2:27:57] character can't reign
[2:27:59] you all heard all of this and from a
[2:28:01] little child
[2:28:03] the little temporary stuff when we go
[2:28:05] through is not worthy to be compared
[2:28:07] with the glory which shall be revealed
[2:28:08] in us when he comes and what treasure
[2:28:10] are laid up this is my last slide oh
[2:28:13] what treasures are laid up for those who
[2:28:14] are willing to enter into his kingdom
[2:28:17] through much tribulation
[2:28:20] we've already concluded we have it
[2:28:21] pretty good
[2:28:26] god's blessed your life
[2:28:29] there's no excuses
[2:28:31] why we can't make it
[2:28:36] so do you know what happened
[2:28:38] this is my last comment
[2:28:41] on june the 12th while we were all
[2:28:43] in bethel tabernacle in buford on june
[2:28:46] the 11th 12th and 13th some of us
[2:28:50] and on that night of i will restore it
[2:28:52] was already saturday in europe
[2:28:54] but on that saturday
[2:28:57] and i'm just going to take these moments
[2:28:59] to just close on this because it means
[2:29:00] something brother matthew the very
[2:29:02] weekend
[2:29:03] god was confirming i will restore
[2:29:06] something was happening in another
[2:29:07] continent
[2:29:10] and it happened in the world soccer
[2:29:11] tournament
[2:29:13] when denmark was playing
[2:29:15] schindlin
[2:29:18] and there was one of their star players
[2:29:20] but christian eriksen he was 29 years
[2:29:24] old from denmark
[2:29:26] and the 43rd minute of this
[2:29:28] soccer i know in america here soccer
[2:29:31] football
[2:29:32] isn't as popular but in in europe
[2:29:35] denmark was playing
[2:29:36] finland in a world soccer tournament
[2:29:39] he's 29 years old and erickson is just
[2:29:42] running running and he just collapses on
[2:29:44] the field
[2:29:46] his heart stopped
[2:29:49] here's a man that's strong and he had
[2:29:51] ran well and
[2:29:53] he had done good and he was a star
[2:29:55] player and he just
[2:29:57] runs around the net like this and then
[2:29:59] he's running up this side and then he
[2:30:01] just collapses and the stadium goes
[2:30:03] quiet
[2:30:05] his heart had stopped
[2:30:08] i'm bringing this to show restoration
[2:30:10] continues
[2:30:12] and here's a young man laying on the
[2:30:14] field and his all his players on his
[2:30:17] team they they lock their arms around to
[2:30:19] give protection as they're as they're
[2:30:22] putting chest compressions and cpr
[2:30:25] come back to us christian come back to
[2:30:27] us
[2:30:29] and
[2:30:29] the agents the medical team is working
[2:30:32] on them putting the defibrillator
[2:30:35] come back to us come back to us
[2:30:38] one article i read said they revived him
[2:30:43] another one said they brought him back

[2:30:52] player christian
[2:30:54] i'm talking about you
[2:30:56] and how people might run well they might
[2:30:58] look good and then all of a sudden they
[2:31:00] collapse in no life
[2:31:03] their heart is gone
[2:31:05] it's like come on let's go let's pick it
[2:31:07] up let's worship let's live and
[2:31:12] i lost my heart
[2:31:16] i lost my will
[2:31:19] i was laying down there on the field
[2:31:22] i lost my heart
[2:31:25] thank god there was medical people there
[2:31:27] that have been trained to rush out there
[2:31:29] and
[2:31:29] put defibrillators on
[2:31:31] come on christian come back to us
[2:31:35] i've looked into the face
[2:31:36] of a young man that was in this lifeless
[2:31:38] condition and screaming out his name
[2:31:42] come back to me come back to me
[2:31:46] and he came back
[2:31:48] he's alive tonight
[2:31:51] come back to me come back to me i'm
[2:31:54] streaming his name
[2:31:59] christian
[2:32:01] you ran well you were strong you were
[2:32:03] one of our players and now you're down
[2:32:07] the story doesn't end there they got him
[2:32:10] back and he began to breathe and they
[2:32:12] got him some help and he was able to get
[2:32:15] a pacemaker in
[2:32:16] actually the
[2:32:18] whole
[2:32:19] soccer division in italy don't want him
[2:32:21] to play in their country no more with so
[2:32:23] he has to transfer to another team to
[2:32:25] play i thought it's incredible somebody
[2:32:28] wants to play they want to go on just
[2:32:30] with a natural game and there's a whole
[2:32:32] country there's a whole federation that
[2:32:34] says you can't play with us
[2:32:37] but there's a drive there's a passion i
[2:32:39] thought of this tonight
[2:32:42] if a natural player of a soccer game can
[2:32:45] be revived and brought back to life
[2:32:48] can a spiritual life
[2:32:51] of a person
[2:32:52] that is down
[2:32:55] they're not breathing they lost hope
[2:32:57] they've lost energy they're down
[2:33:00] if they can do that in the natural and
[2:33:03] bring back a life and he's living
[2:33:05] tonight
[2:33:07] can't our great god
[2:33:09] breathe into the life of a person that
[2:33:12] is gone there's no life they're
[2:33:14] backslidden they don't know where they
[2:33:16] are
[2:33:17] cannot a greater life i'm talking to you
[2:33:21] cannot a greater power speak to them and
[2:33:24] say come forth
[2:33:27] i want you to live
[2:33:29] i see beyond the now
[2:33:32] i see beyond this lifeless form
[2:33:35] and you've got your face in the dirt
[2:33:38] and you're dislevelled
[2:33:41] and you really don't know where you're
[2:33:43] at
[2:33:44] but to have a voice speak to that person
[2:33:46] and bring them back and then to get up
[2:33:48] again and tonight be living and walking
[2:33:50] and breathing

[2:44:49] we have some here at the altar there's
[2:44:50] no reason to be in a hurry friends
[2:44:53] you know that was the holy spirit
[2:44:55] i felt it just buried my seat fill it
[2:44:58] right now the same confirmation with
[2:45:00] john
[2:45:01] you know this is what was on our hearts
[2:45:06] you know every time we just try to
[2:45:08] express even our own group there
[2:45:10] expressing our
[2:45:12] our innermost desire for what we wanted
[2:45:14] the lord to do we kept coming back to
[2:45:16] that word
[2:45:17] restoration lord then we brother jason
[2:45:20] sat there in meeting after me and come
[2:45:22] back to that same word killing
[2:45:25] killing
[2:45:26] killing
[2:45:27] restoration
[2:45:28] bring back don't know any of you don't
[2:45:31] know your lives but
[2:45:32] i believe the lord jesus and it's not
[2:45:34] just for the young people there's a lot
[2:45:36] of old people a lot of adults here today
[2:45:39] receive that from the holy spirit to you
[2:45:42] and then god anointed the message here
[2:45:45] tonight god spoke to your heart
[2:45:48] and i believe it's specific
[2:45:50] it's when god speaks it's laser accurate
[2:45:55] it's just specific tailor-made
[2:45:58] to what you have in your life
[2:46:01] we heard stories of
[2:46:03] john express what happened in our uh own
[2:46:05] local assembly there in my own home and
[2:46:07] then in belgium
[2:46:09] you know it wasn't just in our home and
[2:46:11] in belgium it's here right now
[2:46:14] i felt it when brother john was pouring
[2:46:16] his heart out and preaching the word of
[2:46:18] god and every time he'd come back to
[2:46:19] that that you know there's an anointing
[2:46:21] on the word of god
[2:46:23] and something inside of your heart when
[2:46:25] you have faith to receive it
[2:46:28] and i believe that there was faith in
[2:46:29] the pews and in the aisles here tonight
[2:46:31] as the word was going forth there's some
[2:46:34] at the altar you might have received it
[2:46:35] right there
[2:46:36] just thank god for it say lord thank you
[2:46:39] for sending your word you said i'll send
[2:46:41] my word i'll kill i'll heal my people
[2:46:44] and i believe the lord jesus is bringing
[2:46:46] waves of healing for you sister brother
[2:46:49] that's a wave of healing that you heard
[2:46:51] tonight it's a wave that you feel right
[2:46:54] now all you got to do is reach out and

[2:47:02] me it's for me right here right now that
[2:47:05] word was before me
[2:47:07] that wave of healing was for my family
[2:47:10] not just for brother matt sister rachel
[2:47:12] not for brother john it was from my home
[2:47:14] you wanted to heal my mind you wanted to
