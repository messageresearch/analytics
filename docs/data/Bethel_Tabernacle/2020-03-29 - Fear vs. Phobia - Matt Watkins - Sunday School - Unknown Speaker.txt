[Music] [Music] Exodus chapter 20 amen praise the Lord we'd like to dusty chair just for a few minutes on fear versus phobia fear versus phobia Exodus chapter 20 verse 1 and God spake all these words saying I am THE LORD thy God which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt out of the house of bondage thou shall have no other gods before me thou shalt make unto thee thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image or any likeness of anything that is in heaven or that is in the earth beneath or that is in the water under the earth thou shalt not bow thyself bow down thyself to them nor serve them for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God visiting the iniquity of the father's upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me verse seven thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain verse 12 honor thy father and mother that thy days may be long upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee thou shalt not kill thou shalt not commit adultery thou shalt not steal thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife nor his manservant nor his maidservant nor his ox nor his ass nor anything that is thy neighbor's and all the people saw the thunderings and the Lightning's and the noise of the trumpet and the mountain smoking and when the people saw it they removed and stood afar off and they said unto Moses speak now with us and we will hear but let not God speak with us lest we die and Moses said unto the people fear not for God is not for God has come to prove which means to test you and that his fear may be before your face is that you sin not you can be seated this morning we like to just look here in contrast that with Hebrews chapter 12 if you want to turn there Hebrews chapter chapter 12 and verse 18 God gives these Ten Commandments and it's amazing because the Bible says that after they heard the thundering and they heard the lightening they seen the smoke the mountain on fire that the Bible says that the people step back they they removed themself that means they stepped away and they said this is you know Moses you can speak to us but we don't ever want to we don't want to have that happen again we're afraid of that and Moses says to fear not it's an important verse there in verse 20 it says Moses said unto them fear not for God has come to prove you to test you and notice that his fear so there's a certain fear that you don't fear and then there's a certain fear that you do fear there's there's a certain fear that is healthy and a certain fear that is unhealthy let's contrast this with Hebrews chapter 12 verse 18 for you are not come Gloria I'm glad for this promise for you or not come unto the mount that might be touched and that burned with fire nor unto blackness and darkness and Tempest and the sound of a trumpet and the voice of words which voice they that heard and treated that the word should not be spoken to them any more for they could not endure that which was commanded and if so much as a beast touch the mountain it shall be stoned or thrust through with a dart and so terrible was this sight that Moses said I exceedingly fear and quake but you are come unto Mount Zion and unto the city of the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem and to an innumerable company of angels to the General Assembly and Church of the firstborn which are written in heaven and to God the judge of all and to the spirits of just men made perfect and to Jesus the mediator of the New Covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of Abel see that you refer you refuse not him that speaketh for if they if for if they scape not who refused him that spake on earth much more shall we not escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven whose voice then shook the earth but now he hath promised saying yet once more I shake not the Earth only but also heaven and this word yet once more signifies the removing of those things that are shaken as of things that are made that those things which cannot be shaken may remain wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have grace whereby we may serve God except ibly with reverence and godly fear for our God is a consuming fire the world that we see today is a world that is living in a in a constant state of fear and not just recently we're seeing we're seeing it come to a maybe a level that we've never seen before but prior to this coronavirus there was an atmosphere of fear man has been constantly falling and to further into a state of fear and fear meaning panic or fear meaning terror and that's a that's a word there that speaks of a of a fear that falls upon you that you that it's a it's a spirit of fear so we know that Jesus even himself predicted that the last days that we live in would be a day that would be full of fear unprecedented fear that he would speak specifically concerning the last days and he said it would be unprecedented fear and I think we're seeing the fulfillment of that right now even if you read the words in Luke chapter 21 verse 25 Jesus says upon the earth distress of Nations with perplexity the sea and I think that word perplexity is what you could use to describe the leaders of the entire world today they are on their faces they are perplexed they are perplexed and he says with perplexity deceive the sea and the waves roaring men's hearts failing them for fear and looking after those things which are coming on the earth for the powers of heaven shall be shaken even in Matthew chapter 24 you get even stronger language or more specific when Jesus says nation shall rise against nation and Kingdom against Kingdom and there shall be famines and pestilences and earthquakes and all these things Jesus says are the beginning of Sorrows so we know that this would be speaking would be speaking specifically of the tribulation period period but he says all these are the beginning of Sorrows men shall betray one another and shall hate one another many false prophets prophets shall arise and shall deceive many he says iniquity shall abound and the love of many shall wax cold these are just some indicators of the end time then shall be Great Tribulation such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time no nor ever shall be for thou for there shall arise false Christ which we know is false anointed ones false Christ's and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders and then he says watch therefore for you know not what hour your Lord doth come you take the entire world today both the the believers and the non-believers both the the saved and the unsaved and I believe what we're witnessing together though our reaction is different than theirs what we're witnessing is the birth pains of the end time we're seeing just the contractions of the world of nature as the Bible says that that all nature doth travail and groan and pain waiting to be delivered waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God waiting for the new head and the new earth and so I believe we're witnessing the birth pains now we're worse we witnessed that though our reaction is different than theirs as God commanded the children of Israel and said don't fear what they fear no it doesn't mean that we don't have fear doesn't mean that we are not susceptible to be an afraid or having a fear or phobia but the by Jesus Jesus picks this up and say or I'm sorry the the in in the Old Testament the the the Bible says don't he tells the children of Israel thou shall not fear it was not a suggestion this was a command that God was commanding them don't fear so we see that even today there's a terrible cloud we're witnessing of fear and distress perplexity there's a feeling you know that it's amazing because people are looking at this that you know we were in such good times before and you can you can look just at a law of contrast and see how that man looks at what we had before coronavirus was good and it really wasn't good it really wasn't good now in comparison to today were they your quarantine at home you can't go anywhere you're afraid even to go to Walmart of the girl or to to McDonald's but but it wasn't good before the coronavirus it was a world that was falling apart you can take time just to list some of the some of the just the shaking our that we were living living in even before this coronavirus broke out and America just cannot fathom the idea they there they're under such a spirit of Lady hacia of people's rights they just cannot fathom a world in which good times are over and and and and they would have to actually do without it they would have to sacrifice now of obviously were you know were the we're nowhere near the worst you know as the best Jesus says this is just the beginning of Sorrows nowhere near the worst but there's been at you look at even in before this there's been just an incredible amount of worldwide a Matisse whether you look at weather the weather and the the earthquakes that are striking the - the tornadoes the hurricanes you know the world all all brother man have said all nature runs in continuity and so all the world's systems in what you know whether you take whether you take you take economic life social life political life it all is running together towards an inevitable end Jesus spoke of this in its tragic you see tragedy after tragedy in the last just number of years we've seen an incredible X to me what would be an incredible acceleration towards destruction more than that more than ever before more than ever before we see an acceleration towards disaster you look at the Hurricanes we've had over just the last few number of years look at the winds of war that are blowing before coronavirus there was fear of war with North Korea then after that it was fear of of war with with Syria and so you know we cannot we can't I don't understand everything I don't think all any of us do and I don't think the Lord even wants us to understand everything we don't have all the answers no no I want to pretend that I do because I we don't know Jesus says you don't know the day or the hour that your Lord cometh but what we can see clearly is a pattern of accelerated destruction in the world will it get will it come back around and things will sort of get back to normal I believe it will I believe this is just another wind of chastisement that the Lord is sending he uses an agent we know that brother Branham says that God don't ever make anybody sick God doesn't send sickness he doesn't cause anybody to be sick he didn't afflict Joe but he gave permission to an agent of Satan to afflict Joe so God may approve some of these things but God's not the one enacting them this is Satan's Eden we're living in not God's and it is can rapidly it's rapidly decaying the world you live in is rapidly decaying and going into more of a pandemic of fear Ecclesiastes chapter 1 verse 18 says in much wisdom is much grief and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow so man is continually to increase an e as he continues to eat from that tree of knowledge and good and evil what he thinks is bringing him health wealth and wisdom is actually bringing him sorrow and sadness and pain and the Bible says the more he increases the more sorrow so man is continuing to destroy himself as he eats from that tree fear is paralyzing it's paralyzed our economy it's paralyzed world governments but but beyond just this coronavirus fear there's the fear people there's a fear pandemic that has been going on for years and years and years and rapidly getting worse the fear of sickness the fear of disease the fear of losing your job the fear of you know cancer the fear of you know it's one it's one wave of fear after the next one after the next and as we said there's a healthy fear and an unhealthy fear you know we we teach our children to not you know go run out in front of traffic we teach them the fear of vehicles that's a good fear you know you teach the fear fire that's good to have a fear of fire because you don't want to get burnt and there are certain things that we teach our children to fear but then there's what we could call a phobia and a phobia is very different you just don't believe me you can go look up brother Wikipedia and he'll tell you that there's a list that science has has name just a a massive alphabetical order list of fears or phobias that come upon people the fear of darkness the fear of noise they've got a name for the fear of heights the the fear of aircraft for flying fear of open places fear of crossing streets fear of sharp or pointed objects fear of cats fear of pain fear of wind the fear of of isolation so we could list all these I just named you the ones in the alphabetical order of a that was just a you go to B and C and D and it just goes on and on and on it's a list of fears or phobias and those phobias lead to paralysis they lead to a person who just can't move or can't go forward but we could take and boil all of these fears every single one of them all of our fears all the fears of humanity that would come upon the man the human after the fall before the fall there was no fear but ever since then man has been declining towards fear but all of our fears can be summed up in one fear and that's the fear of losing your existence that is the fear ultimately that we all fear that the world fears in fact let me go further and say that every other fear is just a symptom of that one disease that fear of losing your existence the the instinct of self-preservation is stronger than any other instinct you have in your body the fear to preserve your own it comes on top of every other instinct and we're afraid fear of we have fear of anything that would threaten what we would call our well-being our health our happiness it's not a sinful thing that's a natural thing that's inside of you the fear of something that would threaten our health or happiness and ultimately that's the fear of death and man is afraid to die because it's the one thing death is the one thing that threatens your existence and you may postpone it but it's inevitable we're all gonna die that's inevitable with humanity now of course we believe in a rapture we believe in a body change but ultimately your body the flesh the temple you're living in is dying every single day it gets closer to death and so it brings our existent to an inn and what's incredible though to me today is that we find people are actually more afraid of what might happen to them before they die rather than what might happen to them after they die people humanity today is more afraid of what leads up to death and what happens before death and what they'll lose before they die but they never contemplate about life after death and what happens there's no in other words there's no fear of what might happen after death there's a fear of what happens before death Jesus says in Matthew chapter 10 and verse 28 he says in fear not this is Matthew chapter 10 verse 28 he says and fear not them which kill the body but are not able to kill the soul but rather feel fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell are not two sparrows sold for a farthing and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your father so notice what Jesus is saying here don't fear Him who can kill the body but fear him who can kill the soul and so people are more afraid it's it's it's actually it's the dying that people are afraid of today rather than death itself afraid of the dying and so there's one fear as we say today there's fear upon fear but you know there's one fear that is completely absent from our world that we live in today and that's the fear of God we fear everything the world fears everything but they lack the only fear that God told us to have and that's the fear of the Lord but the Bible says the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom and so you want to be wise you want to have wisdom fear of the Lord it starts right there the first thing that we need to learn is to fear the Lord more than anything it's more than anything in the world you can live in a life of panic and a life of fear I mean fear can just become paralyzing you can live in that realm of constant fear and constant panic fear of this fear of that fear of this fear of that but the beginning of wisdom is the fear of the Lord you believe that so you notice that fear what is the fear the Lord mean that that word fear when Moses says that the Lord's come to test you that you may receive his fear that we you don't fear as the world fears but you receive his fear and that fear is a reverence it's a the reason the world doesn't fear God is because they are insensitive to the presence of God when you become aware of the presence of God you then fear God what what a brother branham say brother Branham said the reason people don't reverence God is because the reason people don't reverence the presence of God is because they don't recognize the presence of God so the fear of the Lord what is the fear of the Lord it's in a way it's not oh god I'm so afraid of you you're gonna you know if I mess up if I do wrong you're just gonna wipe me up that's not what the fear of the Lord is at all but the fear of the Lord is a reverence it's a godly awareness that's that word right there is about the only word I need to use lest I confuse it it's an awareness of God it's an awareness of the of a holy God as Moses says for our guards Hebrew says for our God is a consuming fire notice what he says here at the very end there that worse that would that verse that we read in verse 28 of Hebrews chapter in chapter 12 he says here in verse 28 wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have grace whereby we may serve God acceptable acceptable notice with reverence and godly fear for our God is a consuming fire so there's we don't fear as the world fears but we have fear we fear the right things not the wrong things there's even a scripture in Isaiah where it says just that it says don't you we don't don't have the fear that they fear don't have it right here before me but the fear of the Lord is Oh is an awareness it's a it's a recognition it's a recognition of the presence of God not just you it's not recognizing that Jesus lived this will never produce the fear of God the recognition or the Mentalist the mental agreement that Jesus was a man who lived doesn't ring on the fear of God the recognition of a historical account of what God did yesterday doesn't bring a fear of God but a present current day awareness of a presence of a living God who's amongst you right now in your everyday life brings a fear of God that's what keeps you from sin fear of the Lord that's what God taught that's what that's what Moses said he said the Lord's come to test you to try you that you may fear them that you may not sin and so the fear of God it's a it's a it's a it's a fear or an awareness that that God oh that were held accountable for our motives we're held accountable for our thoughts that there's a the Holy Spirit is just that what is the holy spirit it's the spirit of Jesus Christ living inside of you and when you have that spirit of Jesus Christ living inside you it's a tutor it's a teacher it's a convicted of sin it's that it's that it's that voice inside of you that tells you you're doing wrong you shouldn't do that not to do that don't ever disobey that voice that's the voice of the Lord speaking to you in the in a spirit in your own spirit that if you have the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit convicts you of sin convicts you when you're wrong so that that fear of the Lord is that you realize that there's the err that there's an account that you're accountable for your thoughts you're accountable for your motives your words your acts your actions and so what is the fear of the Lord it's a desire to say I want to I want to reverence the Lord I want to live in harmony with what he wants I want to live in harmony with his actions with what he views as righteousness I want to live by that righteousness and so notice here the Bible says the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom so we're out of time here this morning didn't didn't get to exactly what we wanted to but we kind of stop right there and just trust the Lord until next time let's stand to our feet and let's just pray Lord Jesus we thank you Father Lord that you as your word says have you've not given us the spirit of fear that doesn't mean we can't receive it Lord you just said I'm not the one who gives that spirit I give you a spirit of power of love and of a sound mind Lord keep us from fearful Lord of a world of fear keep us Lord Jesus and your word keep us in your presence O God I pray and Jesus Christ name Amen
