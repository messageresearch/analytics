[24:15] Bard all the windows fastened
[24:19] down I spent the night in
[24:23] sleeplessness and Rose at every sound
[24:28] half in helpless sorrow and half in fear
[24:33] the
[24:34] day would find the solders breaking
[24:38] through to drag us all
[24:42] [Music]
[24:47] away well just before the
[24:50] sunrise I heard something at the
[24:54] wall the gate began to rattle
[24:58] and the voice began to
[25:01] call I hurried to the
[25:04] window and looked down into the
[25:09] streets expecting swords and
[25:12] torches and the sound of soldiers
[25:16] [Music]
[25:21] feet there was no one there but
[25:25] Mary so I went down to let her
[25:29] in John stood there beside me she told
[25:34] us where she'd
[25:36] been she said they moved him in the
[25:40] night none of us knows
[25:43] where the stones been rolled away and
[25:47] now his body isn't
[25:50] [Laughter]
[25:52] there we both ran toward the
[25:56] garden John ran on
[25:59] aead we found the stone and the empty
[26:03] tomb just the way that fa said but the
[26:08] winding sheets they wrapped him in was
[26:11] just an empty
[26:14] shell how and where they taken him was
[26:19] more than I could
[26:21] [Music]
[26:26] tell well something strange had happened
[26:30] there just what I did not
[26:34] know John believed a
[26:37] miracle but I just turned to go
[26:42] circumstance and
[26:44] speculation couldn't lift me very
[26:48] high cuz it seen them crucify
[26:52] him then I saw him die
[26:58] [Music]
[27:01] well back inside the house again the
[27:05] guilt and anguish
[27:08] came everything i' promised him just
[27:12] added to my shame when at last it came
[27:17] to
[27:18] choices I denied I knew his
[27:22] name and even if he was
[27:25] alive it wouldn't be the
[27:28] [Music]
[27:34] same well
[27:36] suddenly the air was filled with a
[27:39] strange and sweet
[27:41] perfume a light that Shone from
[27:44] everywhere drove Shadows from the
[27:49] room Jesus stood before
[27:52] me with his arms held open
[27:55] wide and I fell down on on my knees and
[28:00] just clung to him and
[28:08] cried he raised me to my
[28:12] feet as I looked in his
[28:16] eyes love was shining out from him like
[28:20] sunlight from the
[28:23] skies guilt and my
[28:26] confusion disappeared in sweet
[28:30] release and every fear I'd ever had just
[28:35] melted into

[40:49] 8 it is reported commonly that there is
[40:52] fornication among you and such
[40:55] fornication as is not so much as is
[40:58] named among the Gentiles that one should
[41:01] have his father's wife and ye are puffed
[41:04] up and have not rather mourned that he
[41:08] that hath done this deed might be taken
[41:10] away from among you for I verily as

[41:22] so done this deed in the name of the
[41:25] Lord Jesus Christ when you are gathered
[41:27] together and my spirit with the power of
[41:30] our Lord Jesus Christ to to deliver such
[41:34] a one unto Satan for the destruction of
[41:37] the flesh that the spirit may be saved

[42:09] leaven neither with the leaven of malice
[42:12] and wickedness but with the unleavened
[42:16] bread of sincerity and Truth amen we'll
[42:21] comment just in a moment let's
[42:24] pray father we come before for you this
[42:28] morning Lord and our hearts are just the
[42:31] heart of a Seeker this morning seeking
[42:34] your will seeking your perfect will Lord
[42:37] and how to go forward you see the
[42:40] thought that's in my heart and Lord the
[42:43] struggles of my mind about how it should
[42:46] best be presented I commit myself into
[42:49] your hands as I did in the early morning
[42:52] hours Lord I'm standing here committed
[42:55] to you and ask Lord in this import
[42:57] important time in this darkening world
[42:59] with Lord trouble on every hand we must
[43:03] see you clearly we must we must see your
[43:06] movements Lord we must know the time
[43:09] that we stand and the challenges that
[43:11] are we're facing father I commit this
[43:14] now into your hands I have centered in
[43:18] uh my whole thinking and my mind and my
[43:20] heart to your service now and I pray you
[43:23] will bring forth the Word of Life To Us
[43:25] Lord there's a great request father
[43:29] placed before the Believers today
[43:31] concerning this man Lord who has
[43:33] discovered cancer and Lord he reaches
[43:35] out to someone to a cousin to a friend
[43:39] to someone like a brother who he knows
[43:41] knows God lord I pray that you'll reward
[43:45] that faith that he has to reach out Lord
[43:48] to brother Bradley and be assured
[43:51] through our dear brother that this whole
[43:53] assembly will take him up in prayer Lord
[43:56] we ask for your Mercy today Father we
[43:59] commit it now as brother Bradley and I
[44:01] stood together in the back praying we
[44:04] sending forth the Holy Spirit Lord May
[44:06] the enemy be rebuked and repulsed we
[44:09] commit it to you in Jesus name amen God
[44:12] bless you friends you can be seated
[44:28] praise the
[44:29] Lord I want
[44:31] to move into areas today that the Lord
[44:36] has opened up to me in this series we're
[44:39] also going to as is my way um
[44:42] periodically drop back and make points
[44:45] that we've already made but points that
[44:47] I have Whitted down to the to the
[44:50] essence of this series points that I
[44:52] think that are vital I wouldn't repeat
[44:55] them if I didn't think they were vital
[44:58] uh but we know that a lot of times not
[45:01] everyone hears every sermon all at the
[45:02] same time and so there may be someone
[45:05] hearing today some of these things for
[45:07] the first time so if you're hearing them
[45:10] for the second or third time just be
[45:12] patient because the lord has laid it on
[45:14] my heart to repeat a few of the
[45:16] statements that I've made before as we
[45:19] at the same time simultaneously are
[45:21] going forward in our
[45:23] thought we took this idea of the voice
[45:28] in the East Wind uh and it's familiar to
[45:31] you by now because we have found that
[45:34] generally speaking the East Wind in the
[45:36] Bible is a negative thing we find that
[45:40] the East wind's role as a very it is and
[45:45] as such it is a powerful metaphor in the
[45:49] biblical narrative it's it's a lot of
[45:51] imagery and uh it we have found in our
[45:54] study that it represents three distinct
[45:58] things it represents more than three but
[46:01] three of the main thoughts of the East
[46:03] Wind and that is it generally represents
[46:07] divine intervention it's or it might
[46:11] represent Divine judgment or it might
[46:16] represent the futility of human
[46:19] Endeavors and human Endeavors are not
[46:22] futile unless they're moving in a
[46:24] direction contrary to God's blueprint
[46:27] for our lives you should really go by
[46:30] the instruction manual the the person
[46:33] who wrote this built you and knows
[46:36] everything about you and has a plan and
[46:39] a pathway forward for you so we find
[46:44] that a lot of times people choose the
[46:47] wrong direction and God sends an East
[46:50] Wind sometimes it's intervention in
[46:52] Mercy sometimes it's judgment sometimes
[46:55] it's to uh arrest you from going in a
[47:00] wrong direction regardless of what it is
[47:03] I am of a mind today to say thank you
[47:06] Lord for however you had to bring it in
[47:09] my life by whatever means that you have
[47:13] found necessary to keep me going forward
[47:16] according to your vision I just say
[47:18] praise God I don't say I always enjoyed
[47:20] it I don't say it was always something
[47:23] good the people think that all things uh
[47:26] are good to them that love the Lord
[47:29] that's not what the Bible teaches us the
[47:30] Bible doesn't teach that all things are
[47:32] good that happen to you it teaches that
[47:35] God will make them all work together for
[47:37] your good and so so we realize then that
[47:42] that we took a text in part one of
[47:45] pharaoh and how that he came up upon the
[47:48] eighth plague and he had already heard
[47:52] the word of the Lord in the previous
[47:55] seven plagues that had hit
[47:57] flawlessly exactly what Moses said would
[48:00] happen happen and so when he when he
[48:03] still refused then the Lord sent an East
[48:06] Wind and the Bible says and it blew all
[48:09] night and in the next morning the East
[48:11] Wind in the East Wind came the Locust
[48:15] and we took this thought that we've said
[48:17] several times how is it that Pharaoh
[48:22] didn't hear the voice in the East Wind
[48:25] you'd think that after seven times he
[48:28] would have got it uh but then sometimes
[48:32] I wonder in my own life and in our own
[48:35] lives do we always hear his voice we go
[48:39] about our life and we go about a path
[48:41] and we we think we know what's best for
[48:43] our life and the Lord starts warning us
[48:45] and starts warning us and starts warning
[48:47] us and sometimes you know we we have
[48:50] moments of clarity and sincerity and we
[48:54] we repent we say Lord help me to get
[48:56] back on your path uh because we we find
[48:59] that God has a perfect path sometimes
[49:03] that you will get in his permissive will
[49:05] and he will allow it but I'm here to
[49:07] tell you that that never ends
[49:10] well don't don't use that like a pass
[49:14] and say well maybe I'll just take his
[49:17] permissive will that never ends well
[49:20] because the whole thing is that God will
[49:24] allow that to happen for a season and
[49:27] you go off of his path don't don't think
[49:29] that he'll just sit back and watch he'll
[49:31] actually keep guiding you and he'll keep
[49:34] bending you and bending you and bending
[49:36] you and every time he bends and changes
[49:38] the angle it
[49:39] hurts until he gets you back on his
[49:42] straight and narrow path listen if
[49:45] you're a child of God then he has an
[49:48] exact path he's never going to lose you
[49:51] and he will have to do say what might he
[49:53] have to do to get me uh to Glory where
[49:57] he has foresaw me from the foundation of
[49:59] the world well I just would say let him
[50:03] have his way because if you let him have
[50:05] his way it'll be good and if you don't
[50:08] let him have his way it'll be bad and
[50:11] he'll have his way
[50:14] anyway for that I'm also thankful for
[50:18] that I'm also grateful because sometimes
[50:22] I've persisted after one whipping two
[50:24] whippings three whippings four whippings
[50:27] sometimes a child just keeps going
[50:30] determined to do it their way until
[50:32] finally something happens to where they
[50:35] are they either are so broken or their
[50:38] life is broken that they can't keep
[50:40] going forward and I don't want to see
[50:42] that happen to me I don't want to see it
[50:45] happen to you this is why we
[50:48] preach this is why this is the house of
[50:51] correction this is why judgment begins
[50:54] at the house of the Lord I was I was
[50:56] watching a few clips and I'm not I don't
[50:59] mean to disparage I don't mean to come
[51:01] across that way uh you know it's just a
[51:04] lack of understanding but I I watched a
[51:07] few Clips I came across them uh where
[51:10] they were you you they're I guess
[51:12] they're called shorts or whatever where
[51:15] preachers and these were these were
[51:18] nominal preachers uh that have these
[51:21] little brief clips of their Ministry and
[51:24] I I thought to myself oh wonderful let
[51:27] me just let me just give this a fair
[51:30] hearing and it wasn't that I heard
[51:33] anything wrong I just heard a bunch of
[51:38] uselessness and I went to a second one I
[51:41] said okay may that just must be a
[51:43] one-off and I listened to a second one
[51:46] and I didn't hear anything wrong but I
[51:48] didn't hear anything of value and I went
[51:51] to a third one I thought three is a
[51:53] charm surely and it's a totally
[51:55] different organiz ation now three
[51:57] nobody's going to strike out three times
[51:59] in a row wouldn't you imagine again I
[52:03] didn't hear anything horrible detestable
[52:05] or wrong but I didn't hear anything that
[52:08] told me the age I'm living in the world
[52:12] condition that I'm facing how do I
[52:14] navigate it how do I get home how do I
[52:16] get
[52:17] clean all I heard was psychological
[52:21] theory about how we can be a better
[52:23] person and and how we can fight the the
[52:26] the the the battle of the mind a little
[52:28] more clearly I I have the uh War book I
[52:33] have one a battle one1 I have God's
[52:37] answer I can see how he did it in the
[52:40] lives of his
[52:42] family and so I know that if I believe
[52:46] God in this age like my brothers and
[52:48] sisters believed him in previous ages he
[52:51] being the same yesterday and forever
[52:53] will always act and do and respond the
[52:55] same way for me as he did for them
[52:58] sir and I take great comfort in
[53:02] that you're guaranteed friends to hear
[53:05] things that you're not going to hear in
[53:08] the average Sunday morning pull pit I
[53:11] don't say that to disparage I just
[53:13] simply say we need to do a better job of
[53:16] getting the truth
[53:18] out so so we find then that that there
[53:22] is this
[53:23] idea we found another instance
[53:27] as far as I'm rehearsing we found that
[53:31] there is the the whole thing of filling
[53:33] your mouth with the East Wind or we
[53:37] really emphasize more filling your life
[53:41] with the East Wind when you're filling
[53:43] your mouth with East when you're
[53:45] basically filling your mouth and your
[53:47] thoughts with words that sound great
[53:50] like what I heard but serve no purpose
[53:53] they're just
[53:54] Bluster and it's just it just has no
[53:57] real
[53:59] tangible
[54:01] usable strength-giving
[54:04] lifegiving sin killing effect and if
[54:07] you're hearing a word that isn't sin
[54:09] killing you're wasting your
[54:12] time because we're we're we not only are
[54:16] we born in sin but we born into a sinful
[54:19] world and this is serious you know the
[54:23] the the scripture that warns of the end
[54:25] time and we see it happening around us
[54:28] and even right now you know I I looked
[54:31] at a headline just before leaving the
[54:34] home and I thought let me just find one
[54:37] headline that sums up yesterday or last
[54:40] night's events with Israel being
[54:42] attacked on upon their Sovereign Nation
[54:45] from within another Sovereign Nation it
[54:47] should be an act of War it's one thing
[54:50] to attack from proxies and other nations
[54:52] but when you when one boundary Nation
[54:54] launches a direct attack on another
[54:56] boundary Nation I don't know why the
[54:59] knesset why Netanyahu hasn't already
[55:02] issued a declaration of war that's what
[55:04] we did that's right when we were
[55:06] attacked by the Empire of Japan in 1941
[55:09] our president went to Congress to ask
[55:11] for a declaration of war and it was
[55:14] granted so you say do you want War I
[55:17] want Heaven I want whatever it takes to
[55:20] get me gone I want to I want King Jesus
[55:23] to come back and take over this world
[55:25] it's br
[55:27] broken there's no fixing
[55:30] it not preaching a message of
[55:32] hopelessness today quite the contrary
[55:35] I'm telling you we're the only place
[55:37] that there is hope and that is in the
[55:39] revealed word of the hour you'll see why
[55:41] even more clearly as we go
[55:44] yes so you know when you have a a life
[55:51] Pursuit that has no you say well wait a
[55:55] minute I you know my schooling has a
[55:57] purpose uh this career has a purpose you
[56:01] know I have a purpose in having these
[56:03] certain friends I have a purpose in
[56:05] going in this certain direction what are
[56:07] you talking about preacher
[56:09] purposelessness okay can can I can I
[56:11] amend my statement when your life has no
[56:16] Eternal
[56:18] purpose why is that important because
[56:21] everything outside of that is going to
[56:22] go to Ash and Cinder so whatever you're
[56:25] chasing is going in Flames anyhow so I
[56:28] just say whatever has an eternal purpose
[56:31] that's going to be my purpose and if
[56:33] you're not filling your life with
[56:35] eternal purpose that can
[56:38] survive then your then your purpose is
[56:41] just the purpose of the East
[56:46] Wind we've shown you how that people
[56:51] don't realize the futility of filling
[56:53] themselves with the East Wind and we
[56:55] made this point last time and I'm just
[56:57] going to hit it quickly and move on
[57:00] because I think it's again it's a vital
[57:02] point A lot of times we don't
[57:04] realize uh the futility of doing that
[57:07] because simply s speaking our lives are
[57:11] just too short and we don't really get a
[57:13] good perspective of things till you're
[57:15] already old and about to die and then
[57:18] you you you get like Solomon you get
[57:20] Melancholy and you look back on your
[57:22] life and you regret all kinds of things
[57:23] and I wish I'd have did it different th
[57:26] this is the great um weakness of
[57:29] Youth that that you that youth have such
[57:32] a hard time seeing there's things that
[57:35] that I can say to young people now and I
[57:38] know what I'm talking about cuz I was
[57:40] them then and now I'm now and I can see
[57:44] and I had other friends that I can see
[57:46] now who were like them then so I'm
[57:50] speaking from experience I can say don't
[57:53] chase the East Wind whatever you do
[57:54] young people don't do that you're going
[57:56] to regret that when you're
[57:59] older you you don't it's and and and the
[58:02] sad part about regret now sometimes
[58:06] things happen beyond our control that
[58:09] are regrettable but the one that just is
[58:12] sand in my teeth and will be in yours I
[58:15] promise you is when you face regret that
[58:18] is
[58:20] needless in other words it's regret that
[58:23] need not have
[58:25] been you you didn't have to end up like
[58:27] that you could have made different
[58:29] choices I got a recommendation to you
[58:31] young people listen to your pastor today
[58:34] find you somebody well older than you
[58:37] seasoned who you can see has faith in
[58:41] God and loves the Lord and believes the
[58:44] word and has already made the mistakes
[58:46] you made and has repented and has set
[58:49] their sales for home you you if you want
[58:51] to be enamored with somebody be enamored
[58:54] with that person find yourself a sage
[58:57] somebody of wisdom somebody that you can
[59:00] admire and pattern because they know
[59:03] what they're talking about because
[59:04] they've been there they've done that and
[59:07] they don't even want to tell you how
[59:08] many T-shirts they have
[59:12] wow my closet got so overran I just had
[59:15] to burn
[59:20] some and so because life is so short by
[59:25] the time the judgments are realized it's
[59:28] already on you and that's just what I
[59:30] can tell you from experience there you
[59:33] know you're you're because especially
[59:35] when you're young a lot of times you're
[59:36] not able to
[59:38] comprehend that high altitude view that
[59:41] God use to set all your priorities
[59:44] correctly it can't occur it can't occur
[59:47] to you let me just say it like that it
[59:49] can't occur to me it didn't it can't
[59:51] occur to you uh that consequences that
[59:54] are not see able right now they're not
[59:59] seeable right uh right right at this
[1:00:01] moment and uh and and perhaps even for
[1:00:05] decades but there those consequences
[1:00:08] that might not be seen for decades are
[1:00:10] actually being formed by the seed you're
[1:00:13] sewing in the decade you're in
[1:00:18] now see and so it's the one you're in
[1:00:21] presently and it's all happening in real
[1:00:23] time so you don't notice it so well this
[1:00:27] is why God sends his
[1:00:34] word because he knows what I just told
[1:00:37] you he knows you can't really grasp it
[1:00:40] and really see it and lest you sow seeds
[1:00:43] of discrepancy uh in your life right now
[1:00:47] and I said to you this time that last
[1:00:49] time that seeds of discrepancy are some
[1:00:52] of the most reliable crop you can plant
[1:00:56] nature will see to
[1:00:59] it I said to you last time I'm going to
[1:01:02] say it again they don't even need Faith
[1:01:04] to make them come up the sinful Fallen
[1:01:07] world that you live in will bring them
[1:01:09] to harvest trust
[1:01:12] me this is exactly why God sends his
[1:01:15] word so you can avoid sewing the wrong
[1:01:18] seed which which more often than not
[1:01:22] sadly comes up much later with very
[1:01:24] little remedy
[1:01:26] this is why God sends his word this is
[1:01:29] why God sends you a highflying prophet
[1:01:34] because highflying prophets they're so
[1:01:37] valuable because they they they're like
[1:01:39] eagles and they soar High they're the
[1:01:42] ones who are built by the Lord to fly
[1:01:44] high enough to see the regrets that
[1:01:47] you'll have when you fill yourself or
[1:01:49] your life with the East Wind
[1:01:52] yeah this is the astronaut age
[1:01:56] that is a unique characteristic of this
[1:01:59] age we have spent a long time getting
[1:02:03] here the church has been going forward
[1:02:06] for 20
[1:02:08] centuries 2,000 years to get to now it's
[1:02:13] had its ins and outs and its ups and
[1:02:15] downs its successes and failures and
[1:02:18] that first church age fell away I'm here
[1:02:21] to tell you we are an astronaut age and
[1:02:24] as such we are built to fly
[1:02:28] high above this crumbling world that's
[1:02:31] crumbling around us you're built you're
[1:02:34] uniquely built to fly high above
[1:02:40] it brother brandham says in Christ is
[1:02:43] the mystery of God
[1:02:45] revealed the church this is a profound
[1:02:49] statement the church is the blood of
[1:02:52] Christ by the spirit now you can't get
[1:02:54] that outside of the word it's impossible
[1:02:57] that's why it's a bleeding word because
[1:02:58] it got life in it that's why
[1:03:00] denominations can't never hit it because
[1:03:01] that's man-made systems see the only one
[1:03:04] who can give you a bleeding word is the
[1:03:06] same one that the only one who can give
[1:03:08] you the
[1:03:09] token the only one who who had the seal
[1:03:12] the one who ascended from the East and
[1:03:14] stopped the judgments having the Seal of
[1:03:16] the Living God is the Holy Ghost he's
[1:03:18] the only one who can seal you in and set
[1:03:21] your life in the correct path see so
[1:03:26] in this astronaut age brother brandham
[1:03:28] says it this
[1:03:30] way the church is the blood of Christ by
[1:03:33] the spirit I elected on purpose not to
[1:03:35] have a PowerPoint I just want your your
[1:03:37] attention right
[1:03:39] here the church is the blood of Christ
[1:03:42] by the spirit because the life is in the
[1:03:44] blood that's the baptism of the Holy
[1:03:47] Ghost we've been teaching on that
[1:03:49] brother Brad has been teaching in the
[1:03:51] young people's sessions going to teach
[1:03:53] on it some more today at the end of our
[1:03:55] Gathering brother Matt has been teaching
[1:03:58] on it uh very astutely and and so we
[1:04:01] we're finding a prophet says here it's
[1:04:04] the baptism of the Holy Ghost that
[1:04:06] baptizes us into his body I mean don't
[1:04:11] young people don't worry about getting
[1:04:13] elected into a student body how about
[1:04:16] you get baptized into his
[1:04:18] body don't worry about there a certain
[1:04:20] group of friends that you would like to
[1:04:22] be on the IT Crowd don't worry about
[1:04:24] that body of friends worry about being
[1:04:26] baptized into his
[1:04:31] body it's the B it baptizes us into his
[1:04:34] body that recognizes only his body his
[1:04:36] flesh his word denominations won't never
[1:04:38] touch that it's a revelation she knows
[1:04:42] it so did watch now so did Eve know it
[1:04:45] see now he's going to show you you're a
[1:04:47] unique age you're we can make types and
[1:04:50] shadows from Eve and relate them to
[1:04:53] you we can make types and Shadows of
[1:04:56] Sarah and relate them to you of Rahab
[1:04:58] and relate them to you of Mary and
[1:05:00] relate them to
[1:05:01] you but but but the prophet is coming to
[1:05:04] say there's an
[1:05:07] unprecedented group that have never been
[1:05:10] in the earth in this level watch what he
[1:05:14] says denominations won't touch that
[1:05:17] never touch that it's a revelation she
[1:05:19] knows it so did Eve know it but she
[1:05:22] fell but this one this bride
[1:05:26] this one knows it and won't fall the
[1:05:29] early church
[1:05:31] fell but this bride knows it and won't
[1:05:35] fall she's ordained Hallelujah she is
[1:05:40] ordained to not
[1:05:44] fall she won't
[1:05:47] fall she's predestinated to it blessed
[1:05:51] now
[1:05:52] listen that's not just like oh happy day
[1:05:56] oh lucky day oh I've won the lottery I'm
[1:06:00] predestinated to not
[1:06:02] fall you've made mistakes this
[1:06:10] week you you'll make mistakes
[1:06:13] tomorrow what do you mean she's
[1:06:15] predestinated to not fall listen to what
[1:06:18] it's based
[1:06:20] on she is ordained to not fall she won't
[1:06:27] fall she is predestinated to it and he
[1:06:31] goes to the scripture uniquely uniquely
[1:06:34] for this age it's a scripture way old
[1:06:37] many thousands of years old the church
[1:06:39] has rejoiced over it but in the unique
[1:06:41] age of a bride that's predestinated not
[1:06:44] to fall elected not to fall he goes back
[1:06:47] and picks up a prophecy concerning
[1:06:49] Christ that David wrote about blessed is
[1:06:52] the man who God will not impute sin am
[1:06:57] God has sent this team of astronauts to
[1:07:01] not
[1:07:02] fall and the astronauts that that that
[1:07:06] that that this prophecy is speaking of
[1:07:09] it's not that we won't make mistakes
[1:07:11] it's that in this age they can't
[1:07:16] count because that's how unique this
[1:07:19] ages that you are predestinated not to
[1:07:22] fall say but I do fall it won't count
[1:07:25] why because I'm under a bleeding
[1:07:27] word denominations will never do that
[1:07:31] man-made thinking can't can't do that
[1:07:34] what you do then you have to pay for it
[1:07:36] but he's saying when you are in
[1:07:37] possession of the bleeding word when you
[1:07:40] have the token life then the blood
[1:07:42] speaks for me every moment of my
[1:07:46] existence and even if I do make a
[1:07:49] mistake he'll drive me to my knees and
[1:07:51] I'll repent and I'll come with the
[1:07:54] unleavened bread of sincerity and I'll
[1:07:57] say father forgive me and he will and
[1:08:00] you'll go right on in
[1:08:03] Victory and Satan will lose every
[1:08:06] ability to accuse
[1:08:12] you these
[1:08:15] astronauts that prophecy tells us are to
[1:08:19] be here right
[1:08:21] now here's my question is that you
[1:08:25] amen then say it's me it's me Hallelujah
[1:08:31] there's astronauts supposed to be here
[1:08:33] it's me say what about your ups and
[1:08:37] downs yeah I got them but it's
[1:08:39] me it's not because I was a great person
[1:08:42] or I'll be a better person tomorrow I'll
[1:08:44] be a if I fall I'll just be more humble
[1:08:47] and I'll owe God more than I already owe
[1:08:49] him that I can never already can't
[1:08:51] pay but I'm here to tell you that's the
[1:08:54] strength and the power of a bleeding
[1:08:57] [Applause]
[1:09:00] word forsake it and doom
[1:09:03] yourself because it's the only place of
[1:09:09] safety have you relinquished the world
[1:09:14] and taken the bleeding word for your day
[1:09:16] be
[1:09:17] honest have you take I I'm not saying
[1:09:20] are you live a perfect life I'm asking
[1:09:22] you today young and old Alik
[1:09:26] have you made a decision to say you need
[1:09:28] to make a decision you sure do here it
[1:09:30] is I'm done with the world I want the
[1:09:33] word I'm down how many will raise a hand
[1:09:36] to that say I might have mistakes I do
[1:09:39] make mistakes but I am I deny the world
[1:09:42] I don't want the world I want Christ I
[1:09:44] want his word I want a token I want it
[1:09:47] to be on
[1:09:49] display amen
[1:09:52] hallelujah the word and the word only
[1:09:56] that can wash you clean and exempt you
[1:09:58] from failures that you are sure to
[1:10:01] have we found in our
[1:10:05] study going from past how we read in
[1:10:08] Psalm 78 such a
[1:10:11] powerful Psalm we read verses 5 through
[1:10:14] 39 we're not going to even reread it
[1:10:16] today but we found out there that you
[1:10:20] know the the the Asaf is
[1:10:23] recounting the
[1:10:26] Chronicles of Israel coming out of
[1:10:30] Egypt and it's it's just rehearsal Force
[1:10:33] how that they you know they murmured and
[1:10:36] they complained and different things
[1:10:38] like that and and the Bible says that he
[1:10:42] caused an East Wind to blow in the
[1:10:44] heaven now this was right as he was they
[1:10:46] were complaining about Mana they did
[1:10:48] they got tired of heavenly
[1:10:51] food they wanted something more from the
[1:10:53] Earth
[1:10:55] get
[1:10:56] me they got tired of heavenly diet they
[1:11:00] wanted something more from the earth
[1:11:03] something that their fallen bodies
[1:11:04] craved more than just Angels
[1:11:06] food I'm sure you see the
[1:11:10] connection and so God was going to send
[1:11:13] them
[1:11:15] quail and he was going to send them so
[1:11:17] much that it would just they couldn't
[1:11:20] even consume them all they would die in
[1:11:23] the camp and stack up and they couldn't
[1:11:25] even eat them fast enough and they
[1:11:26] rotted and
[1:11:28] stank and Jesus picks that up and
[1:11:32] shows that the reason God did
[1:11:35] that was to show that mankind shall not
[1:11:40] live by bread alone but by every word so
[1:11:43] it's not any certain food you thought it
[1:11:45] was Angel's food you thought it was
[1:11:47] quail you thought it was the rock the
[1:11:48] water that came out of the Rock and
[1:11:50] Jesus said I am actually that water I am
[1:11:53] actually that bread Moses didn't give
[1:11:55] you that bread you think he did he
[1:11:57] didn't he didn't give you me he gave you
[1:12:00] a wafer and mana and gave you Quail till
[1:12:02] you got sick you couldn't even eat it
[1:12:03] anymore just like the law gave them the
[1:12:05] law to prove to them they couldn't keep
[1:12:06] it so that all men could become guilty
[1:12:08] and before him and nobody could have a
[1:12:10] claim see so that if he rescues you and
[1:12:16] gives you eternal life it's all on
[1:12:20] him and you you can't take any credit
[1:12:23] all you can do is be a guilty Sinner and
[1:12:25] raise up your hands and say Lord I
[1:12:27] accept your pardon nothing in my arms I
[1:12:30] bring simply to thy cross I
[1:12:34] cling and so he sent this East Wind to
[1:12:37] blow in the heavens and the Bible says
[1:12:39] and by his power he brought in the south
[1:12:41] wind and we told you last time that it
[1:12:43] became a Southeast wind which was a
[1:12:45] mixture of judgment from God's justice
[1:12:48] and his Mercy that is in his love
[1:12:50] because his H Mercy rejoiceth against
[1:12:53] judgment his throne is established in
[1:12:54] Mercy Mercy the Bible tells us and this
[1:12:57] is I would say a Southeast
[1:13:00] wind is the one that I've encountered
[1:13:02] the most and I dare say it's the one
[1:13:05] you've encountered the most because it's
[1:13:07] when I went in the wrong direction and
[1:13:10] God sent an East Wind of judgment but he
[1:13:13] also turned it a little bit and it
[1:13:14] became a south wind became a Southeast
[1:13:17] and and I knew he was he was he was
[1:13:20] spanking me but I knew he loved me I
[1:13:23] knew this was his hand of judgment but
[1:13:25] but it was based on love I knew that he
[1:13:27] was bringing me and said now son I'm
[1:13:28] going to have to do this it pains me
[1:13:30] just like any father would tell a child
[1:13:32] children don't believe that when the
[1:13:34] father says it hurts me more than it
[1:13:35] hurts you and the children say Dad we
[1:13:38] all want you to hurt
[1:13:39] [Laughter]
[1:13:42] yourself but it truly does because God
[1:13:45] loves his people he's like a father like
[1:13:48] a mother he he loves his family he loves
[1:13:51] his children and sometimes he has to
[1:13:54] bring the East Wind but I I I I think it
[1:13:57] was uh might have been brother Caleb I
[1:14:00] think was preaching here about how you
[1:14:03] know that God doesn't bring judgment on
[1:14:05] his family he brings correction that's a
[1:14:08] different it might look and feel like
[1:14:10] judgment but it's correction it's God's
[1:14:12] corrective love I'm so glad he operates
[1:14:15] that way in our
[1:14:16] lives it's often God's way of working
[1:14:19] with Humanity particularly those of his
[1:14:21] own family he operates in our lives uh
[1:14:25] in this way intermingling correction and
[1:14:28] Grace at the same time any preacher that
[1:14:30] really is under the anointing of the
[1:14:32] holy spirit will preach it like that
[1:14:34] that he'll preach judgment he won't he
[1:14:36] won't hold back he'll preach it
[1:14:38] Gunbarrel straight if he knows what's
[1:14:39] good for him but he'll also give the
[1:14:41] people hope that there is love and there
[1:14:43] is forgiveness and there is Grace I
[1:14:45] don't believe in brow beating people and
[1:14:47] taking hope away from people I don't
[1:14:49] care what you position you have put
[1:14:52] yourself in today the medicine that
[1:14:54] comes comes out of the doctor's bag
[1:14:56] might be bitter and have a lot of side
[1:14:57] effects you ain't going to like but take
[1:14:59] it please take it because it only gets
[1:15:02] more and more bitter and the side
[1:15:04] effects only become more and more dire
[1:15:06] so just take it now if you're here today
[1:15:07] and your life is going in the wrong
[1:15:09] direction take the medicine
[1:15:12] now we ended last time and I as you can
[1:15:16] see I'm intermingling old and new
[1:15:18] thoughts and I'm just struggling in my
[1:15:20] mind a little bit because the real
[1:15:21] burden on my heart I don't know if I'll
[1:15:22] get to it today I'd like to but it's up
[1:15:24] to the Lord
[1:15:26] but we found and we we were saying to
[1:15:28] you last time trying to teach you a
[1:15:31] concept that that we say you know God
[1:15:33] works in mysterious ways his his wonders
[1:15:36] to perform or sometimes it's quoted his
[1:15:38] wonders to behold and we were showing
[1:15:41] you last time that that a lot of times
[1:15:44] you you're in the middle of something
[1:15:47] and you know you don't really understand
[1:15:49] what God is doing because it's
[1:15:51] mysterious but if you'll just keep going
[1:15:54] in the right direction
[1:15:55] that it'll become a Wonder that'll be
[1:15:58] performed and you'll behold it and
[1:15:59] you'll see it my so the message is trust
[1:16:02] the Lord now it's interesting I didn't
[1:16:04] have time to go into this last time
[1:16:06] that's one of those Bible principles
[1:16:09] that though we say it in that way it's
[1:16:11] actually not a direct quotation from
[1:16:13] scripture though it's often thought to
[1:16:15] be God moves in mysterious ways his
[1:16:17] wonders to perform it's actually from uh
[1:16:20] a drama written out by a Christian
[1:16:22] Author uh hundreds of years ago
[1:16:25] but brother brandham quotes it we've
[1:16:27] quoted it and it's it's kind of like um
[1:16:29] there's some other ones like that like
[1:16:31] born in uh born in sin shap and iniquity
[1:16:33] come into the world speaking lies that's
[1:16:35] not actually a Bible
[1:16:36] verse that's a mashup of several Bible
[1:16:39] verses it's a principle it teaches a
[1:16:43] principle God moves in mysterious ways
[1:16:46] his wonders to perform or his wonders to
[1:16:48] behold that's a mashup of a number of
[1:16:51] Bible principles put together so that
[1:16:53] you can catch the thought behind it you
[1:16:56] understand so it becomes very useful in
[1:16:58] fact is the word mysterious doesn't even
[1:17:00] really appear uh in the King James at
[1:17:03] all it does appear in other translations
[1:17:05] although it's not very common you know a
[1:17:07] lot of times a a mystery is used instead
[1:17:10] the word mystery is used throughout uh
[1:17:13] and and those refer to divine secrets
[1:17:16] known only through Revelation those are
[1:17:18] things that you want to be interested in
[1:17:20] but you want God to reveal them by
[1:17:22] Revelation you have and I don't I don't
[1:17:25] want to dive too deeply into this today
[1:17:27] because it's just theological stuff but
[1:17:29] there's a Greek word uh
[1:17:31] Mysterion uh which in the original Greek
[1:17:33] manuscripts is described in the gospels
[1:17:36] as the word
[1:17:37] secret see so the term is often
[1:17:40] Associated then with deeper spiritual
[1:17:42] truths of Christianity that are relevant
[1:17:46] to Believers and relevant to your life
[1:17:49] you know it it it these things become
[1:17:51] important to us more important than you
[1:17:53] might think because because sometimes
[1:17:56] wording is everything I'm always very
[1:17:58] selective and very careful how I explain
[1:18:00] something the Bible is extremely
[1:18:02] meticulous it doesn't use even one word
[1:18:06] needlessly every jot and tit every Iota
[1:18:09] that's just
[1:18:11] punctuations everything there even the
[1:18:13] the sense of the word is vital to God he
[1:18:17] he values his word you know above his
[1:18:20] name his word is is the highest thing
[1:18:22] because his name has evolved his word is
[1:18:25] the same yesterday today and forever so
[1:18:27] he values his word even above his name
[1:18:30] you understand so so we realize then
[1:18:33] that how many believe in a supernatural
[1:18:37] God the if you what you'll find is a lot
[1:18:40] of times that the world is generally uh
[1:18:45] they they don't like that word so much
[1:18:48] because if you that what they change it
[1:18:50] to is Magic or magical or it becomes
[1:18:53] Harry Potter
[1:18:54] you know or it becomes some of these
[1:18:56] Disney they've got so many spin-offs now
[1:18:59] uh a spin-off of a spin-off of a
[1:19:01] spin-off and everything about
[1:19:03] superheroes and magic powers and you
[1:19:06] know they don't want to use Supernatural
[1:19:07] because if you use Supernatural then you
[1:19:09] got to admit there's a supernatural
[1:19:10] being and then if you admit they're a
[1:19:12] supernatural being then you're
[1:19:13] responsible to him and that's what they
[1:19:15] don't they don't want they want to avoid
[1:19:16] that so they water it down they they
[1:19:19] change the the jargon they you
[1:19:22] know background noise noise is actually
[1:19:26] how you in that's in military you know
[1:19:29] Jamming 101 that's what that's what
[1:19:32] jamming is is it it it creates it
[1:19:34] creates noise so that the
[1:19:37] seeking device that's seeking here's a
[1:19:39] missile tracking a jet and a lot of
[1:19:42] times that jet can do all kinds of
[1:19:44] countermeasures he can drop flares he
[1:19:45] can drop chaff he can dive down to the
[1:19:48] deck and and and and then the missiles
[1:19:50] got to Chas him down into heavier
[1:19:52] atmosphere and it slows it down and then
[1:19:54] the missile looking at all the ground
[1:19:55] and then there's got to find a jet in
[1:19:57] there because the ground becomes
[1:19:59] background noise photographers
[1:20:01] understand background
[1:20:02] noise and so background noise is how you
[1:20:06] limit detection and I I want you to know
[1:20:10] Satan makes big use out of
[1:20:14] it he makes big use out of background
[1:20:17] noise and social media platforms and uh
[1:20:21] and Hollywood particularly Hollywood are
[1:20:24] leading noise
[1:20:27] makers they're leading noise makers and
[1:20:30] Satan uses them you know what he does he
[1:20:32] uses it to jam the signal coming from
[1:20:35] the throne that's for
[1:20:37] you see brother Brandon now watch watch
[1:20:40] this this progression we're going to go
[1:20:43] to 57 to 61 to 63 and then later at
[1:20:47] 63 1957 first year of America under
[1:20:52] judgment he said if you get back to to
[1:20:54] the spiritual side of it in the
[1:20:56] oldfashioned prayer meetings and take
[1:20:59] the comic books and
[1:21:01] all the old true life stories and things
[1:21:06] off your table and put the Bible there
[1:21:10] and get a wholesome literature Prophet
[1:21:13] wasn't opposed to Wholesome literature
[1:21:14] he read wholesome
[1:21:16] literature and you get wholesome
[1:21:18] literature it would be different around
[1:21:19] your house look at what he's saying that
[1:21:22] you could actually change the atmosphere
[1:21:24] now he can't talk about computers and
[1:21:25] iPads and cell phones and social media
[1:21:28] because they don't exist you understand
[1:21:31] so he's in 1957 he's just hitting at
[1:21:33] true story magazines and and he's going
[1:21:36] to hit cards and he's going to hit comic
[1:21:38] books see and so what does he say in
[1:21:41] 1957 this is what the devil was using to
[1:21:44] add background
[1:21:45] noise see and he's saying if you'd get
[1:21:48] if You' get that stuff out of your house
[1:21:50] and put the Bible out there and hold
[1:21:53] some literature out there it would be
[1:21:55] different it would affect your house it
[1:21:58] would change the
[1:22:00] atmospheres is this okay see it would
[1:22:03] change the atmospheres around
[1:22:06] you he says then in 1961 four years
[1:22:09] later the son of thou son of David have
[1:22:12] mercy on me he says but
[1:22:13] today with all now watch him he's gonna
[1:22:16] he's going to evolve with all of our
[1:22:17] modern convenience boy and how do we got
[1:22:21] them today
[1:22:25] with all of your modern convenience and
[1:22:28] instead of reading the Bible to our
[1:22:31] children we'll turn the television on
[1:22:34] and let them look at something that's
[1:22:36] not even fit for them to look at now
[1:22:39] that's right see that's right and and
[1:22:42] that that doesn't even touch what we've
[1:22:45] done with phones and
[1:22:47] tablets Come on holy people let's own it
[1:22:50] don't don't go quiet on me all right
[1:22:55] and he says it's not even fit for them
[1:22:57] to look at that's right and another
[1:22:59] thing we'll give them and he goes back
[1:23:01] and pulls up an oldie Goldie we'll we'll
[1:23:03] give them these little comic books of
[1:23:05] little old story books boy they've got
[1:23:07] them now that make those back there look
[1:23:10] like Child's Play they've got them now
[1:23:13] filled with all kinds of Supernatural
[1:23:15] demons and Ghouls and they call it magic
[1:23:17] it's
[1:23:18] noise it's Satan permeating the
[1:23:21] atmosphere with
[1:23:22] noise it's Jam the signal that you need
[1:23:25] for Holiness and
[1:23:30] righteousness and some drugstore mantle
[1:23:34] they'll have these story books there
[1:23:36] that watch what a prophet says oh I love
[1:23:38] this Kentucky thinking that oughtn't
[1:23:40] even to be sold to make kindling wood
[1:23:43] out of a fire for a
[1:23:45] fire and
[1:23:47] yet listen what he says to the nation
[1:23:51] and yet we poke all that kind of stuff
[1:23:54] down our children's
[1:23:58] neck see so then it it so then it they
[1:24:02] the these things water down the effects
[1:24:06] and the and the influence of the of a
[1:24:09] supernatural God in your life that's
[1:24:11] what they
[1:24:12] do they water down it's background noise
[1:24:15] it floods the atmospheres it floods
[1:24:17] their minds and
[1:24:20] yours it takes up space in the minds of
[1:24:23] our children that is really needed to
[1:24:25] receive the word of God they add noise
[1:24:28] and confusion to our minds this is why a
[1:24:32] prophet said the greatest battle ever
[1:24:34] fought is in the mind that God and Satan
[1:24:38] agreed that we're going to battle for
[1:24:40] the control of man's heart and that's
[1:24:42] going to come through the influence and
[1:24:44] the things we take into our
[1:24:47] mind so stop filling your home your life
[1:24:51] your mind your kids with the East Wind
[1:24:55] it's just background noise to jam the
[1:24:57] signal of the word that you you come
[1:24:59] here not just children not just young
[1:25:02] people not just college level but adults
[1:25:05] and deacons and preachers and officers
[1:25:08] and if we're not careful our minds are
[1:25:10] so
[1:25:12] sponged we can't even rejoice and clap
[1:25:14] our hands and sing a song and praise God
[1:25:17] even though the Bible says enter his
[1:25:19] gates with Thanksgiving that you are to
[1:25:22] give him the the what his name is due
[1:25:24] the the the reward and the and the
[1:25:27] prestige and the honor the Bible says
[1:25:30] that his name is
[1:25:32] due this is the Battleground the effect
[1:25:35] is that neither you nor your family
[1:25:37] clearly hear the voice of the Lord as
[1:25:39] you should and it
[1:25:43] shows as if that were not bad
[1:25:46] enough these things from the Tree of
[1:25:50] knowledge these seeds of discrepancy
[1:25:54] that fill our minds are actually
[1:25:58] poisonous seeds that have both an
[1:26:01] immediate and a long-term
[1:26:05] consequence
[1:26:07] amen now brother brandham comes to
[1:26:13] 1963 all right you still with me I'm

[1:26:42] moments that if it would have been just
[1:26:43] this once I would have been finished but

[1:27:26] flying high that can see it he can see
[1:27:29] what you can't see see them comic books
[1:27:33] that your children's reading

[1:28:10] my last quote I think I
[1:28:13] have August 1963 how can I overcome
[1:28:16] interesting title valuable valuable how
[1:28:20] can I
[1:28:21] overcome we see this age that we're
[1:28:23] living in stop full stop do you do you
[1:28:28] really see the age that you're living
[1:28:32] in because your life will tell whether
[1:28:35] you really see it whe whether you're
[1:28:36] taking even this sermon today to heart
[1:28:39] and taking it seriously and de I can
[1:28:42] tell you I don't care how IM affected
[1:28:46] you
[1:28:47] feel starting with an a affected you
[1:28:51] might feel unless you leave here and
[1:28:54] with an E effect change then you're not
[1:28:57] getting
[1:28:59] it the only difference between effect
[1:29:01] and effect is one letter but it's all
[1:29:04] the difference in the world right see
[1:29:06] people get affected Paul said that but
[1:29:08] then they go out and forget what manner
[1:29:10] of man the Bible the mirror showed them
[1:29:12] they were they looked at it and my
[1:29:14] goodness I really need help and then go
[1:29:16] right out that door and go I'm fine I
[1:29:18] have I have need of nothing I'm
[1:29:19] increased with Goods I have need of
[1:29:21] nothing I don't need God I don't need a
[1:29:22] prophet I don't need the token I don't
[1:29:23] need the Holy Ghost you're
[1:29:26] wrong he says here we see this age that
[1:29:30] we're living in it's one of boy this
[1:29:33] blew my mind if it wasn't for the next
[1:29:36] paragraph it's one of the grandest ages
[1:29:39] of all ages I'm like wait what this
[1:29:43] leoan church age is the grandest of all
[1:29:46] the church ages because oh okay give me
[1:29:49] the reason because it's the ending of
[1:29:52] time and the blending of Eternity yeah
[1:29:54] woo amen I agree it's the greatest of
[1:29:58] all the ages because it's the ending of
[1:30:00] time and the blending of Eternity and
[1:30:03] then now in perfect contradistinction
[1:30:06] and then it's the greatest sinful age
[1:30:09] and
[1:30:11] how it's more sin in this age than
[1:30:16] there's ever been I'm describing to you
[1:30:18] why your age is
[1:30:20] unique and I'm using kindergarten
[1:30:24] time to point it out to
[1:30:26] you what is it
[1:30:29] now it's more sin in this age than
[1:30:32] there's ever been and the powers of
[1:30:35] Satan in the kindergarten days in
[1:30:39] 1963 and the powers of
[1:30:43] Satan uh is let me let me and the powers
[1:30:47] of Satan is many times harder to fight
[1:30:51] against than it was in any age see here
[1:30:54] it's so
[1:30:55] deceiving this is the great age of
[1:30:58] deception when Christ said so the two
[1:31:01] Spirits would be so
[1:31:04] close in the last days that it would
[1:31:07] deceive the very elected if it was
[1:31:09] possible see see see
[1:31:12] remember your Prophet say
[1:31:14] remember Christ spoke of an elected
[1:31:17] people for the last day it would deceive
[1:31:20] the very elected if it were possible so
[1:31:23] close
[1:31:24] the
[1:31:25] people live sorry the people so live
[1:31:30] people can live a clean holy life not be
[1:31:35] sinful adulterers and Drinkers and liars
[1:31:38] and gamblers they can live above that
[1:31:41] and still not with
[1:31:45] it
[1:31:47] now when I first started reading that
[1:31:49] line I was ready to Rejoice go yes
[1:31:52] Hallelujah I can live above it I cannot
[1:31:55] be an adulterer I cannot be a drinker a
[1:31:57] liar a gambler live a clean holy life
[1:31:59] and and live above it hallelujah praise
[1:32:01] the Lord and still not with it wait
[1:32:05] huh still not with
[1:32:08] it this is why the token life is so
[1:32:13] important this is why the age is so
[1:32:17] unique listen friends and I and I and I
[1:32:20] I'm going to end right here because I
[1:32:22] don't have time to keep going and I want
[1:32:24] I just feel led to move to the real
[1:32:26] burden of my heart although I'll come
[1:32:28] back to it and preach it more
[1:32:31] extensively but but it was brother
[1:32:34] brandham when he was telling for the
[1:32:36] first time in 1961 in Paradox and you're
[1:32:40] still with me you got 10 minutes
[1:32:42] left poor Americans got 10
[1:32:47] minutes I know these seats are cushy but
[1:32:49] endure it AC feels great but just hang
[1:32:53] on don't start
[1:32:57] crying so brother brandham comes to the
[1:32:59] pull pit and he's I'll close my Bible so
[1:33:01] you know that I'm I'm
[1:33:05] done help it'll help me
[1:33:08] too but he he comes and he starts
[1:33:11] telling these
[1:33:13] experiences and it's you're familiar
[1:33:16] with it I promise it's when he was on
[1:33:17] the road and he said I saw myself on a
[1:33:20] map of Palestine lot going on in
[1:33:22] Palestine right now
[1:33:24] and he said' I looked back and he said I
[1:33:26] could see I was two-thirds of the way to
[1:33:28] to crossing the Jordan and the into the
[1:33:30] promised land and he said and I was
[1:33:32] walking along this road and he said
[1:33:35] there was high Weeds on both sides and
[1:33:37] he said there was there was something
[1:33:39] among the people there was an atmosphere
[1:33:41] of
[1:33:42] fear and
[1:33:45] confusion and brother Brenham and
[1:33:47] there's a friend with him are you a
[1:33:50] friend he's got a friend with him and
[1:33:53] and he brother Bram said I could sense
[1:33:56] there was a fear in there was in the
[1:33:58] atmosphere and he said I said what's
[1:34:02] what's wrong what is everybody so afraid
[1:34:05] of and he says about that time I heard
[1:34:08] it coming through the weeds and I heard
[1:34:10] it crashing and as soon as I saw it he
[1:34:13] said I knew immediately it was a
[1:34:15] Mamba and he said this is such a deadly
[1:34:18] Viper he said you've got the this king
[1:34:21] cobra and you've got the yellow Cobra
[1:34:22] and you've got all the said said and
[1:34:23] they're very deadly too he said but when
[1:34:26] when I was in Africa and I've talked to
[1:34:28] African Brothers whove confirmed this
[1:34:30] said that when even when he said when
[1:34:32] those natives would even say somebody
[1:34:34] would yell out Mambo he said they would
[1:34:36] just smash their heads into each other
[1:34:37] trying to run and get
[1:34:39] away they're so terrified of it and he
[1:34:42] said because it's it's just instant
[1:34:44] death as soon as you get bitten you've
[1:34:46] just got minutes to live and that's how
[1:34:49] toxic the Mamba is and he said and they
[1:34:52] they they they move quickly and they
[1:34:54] strike hard and he said a lot of times
[1:34:56] they come across the top of the grass
[1:34:58] and they they they jump and he said they
[1:35:00] people get struck high in the
[1:35:02] face and and he said and and here it
[1:35:05] came out onto the road and everybody's
[1:35:07] screaming and he said and it came at me
[1:35:10] and he said and as it made a charge it
[1:35:12] started coming at me hard and said it
[1:35:14] started getting slower and slower and
[1:35:16] slower and it got right up to me and it
[1:35:18] started shaking and it couldn't get me
[1:35:20] and he said so it doubled back and it
[1:35:21] circled around and here it come again
[1:35:23] and he said it came hard and it got
[1:35:25] slower and slower and slower and it
[1:35:26] couldn't get me and he said I stood
[1:35:29] there looking at it and he said and then
[1:35:30] it went after my friend I'm here to tell
[1:35:33] you something friends a prophet's long
[1:35:35] ago gone and we're not yet in the
[1:35:36] promised land and this thing is striking
[1:35:39] at the friend of a Prophet this thing is
[1:35:42] striking at our lives trying to it it's
[1:35:45] sudden death one bite and you're
[1:35:47] done and so he he says I said I saw my
[1:35:50] friend and he was jumping up and jumping
[1:35:52] around trying to get away and it was
[1:35:54] trying to strike at him and he said I
[1:35:55] cried out oh God have mercy if it hits
[1:35:58] him it'll kill him he said it's just one
[1:36:01] bite it's sudden death and that's what
[1:36:03] every that's what had everybody so
[1:36:06] Disturbed and he said a voice spoke to
[1:36:08] me and said you've been given power to
[1:36:10] bind him
[1:36:12] Hallelujah and he said he said Satan I
[1:36:15] bind you in the name of Jesus Christ and
[1:36:17] he said when I said that he said blue
[1:36:20] smoke which represented his life he said
[1:36:22] it flew out of him came out of his mouth
[1:36:24] and said he curled up and he he brought
[1:36:27] his tail up around and he said it made
[1:36:29] the an symbol like if you're texting and
[1:36:31] you see the an symbol that goes like
[1:36:33] this and comes up and loops and goes
[1:36:35] down and then and then it it loops
[1:36:37] around the beginning it's an an symbol
[1:36:38] like a backwards s and he said and his
[1:36:41] own tail curled around and come down
[1:36:43] went around his own throat and he choked
[1:36:44] his own self out and he fell
[1:36:47] over and he said I walked up and he said
[1:36:50] I I thought he said I thought now this
[1:36:51] is a vision I got to figure out what
[1:36:53] this is about CU he didn't understand it
[1:36:55] and he said I kicked at it and he said
[1:36:57] it had become like glass and it just
[1:37:00] laid there in that symbol choked out
[1:37:02] dead and he said the spirit said you've
[1:37:05] also been given power to loose him wow
[1:37:08] and he said okay I'm just going to test
[1:37:10] it Satan in the name of I loose you in
[1:37:13] the name of Jesus Christ and he said as
[1:37:14] soon as I said that that blue smoke went
[1:37:16] right back in him he started to uncurl
[1:37:19] started to come conscious and brother
[1:37:21] Bram said quickly I said I bind you in
[1:37:22] the name of Jesus
[1:37:25] and he said and the blue smoke went back
[1:37:26] out of him what is it showing friends
[1:37:28] that blue smoke was life it meant that
[1:37:30] the greater is he that's in you than he
[1:37:33] that's in the
[1:37:34] world Satan is real he has a life but
[1:37:37] there's a greater life there's a token
[1:37:40] life in this bride in this unique bride
[1:37:43] of this unique
[1:37:47] age has
[1:37:49] Zenith never before had he had 6,000
[1:37:53] years to finishes Eden until now when
[1:37:56] Paul faced him he'd only been 4,000
[1:37:57] years in building now he's had 6,000
[1:38:00] years and brother Brown said just as God
[1:38:02] took 6,000 years to build his Eden now
[1:38:04] Satan's had 6,000 years to build his
[1:38:07] this is a trying
[1:38:09] time and just and and and and Paul talks
[1:38:13] about the perilous times at the end time
[1:38:16] and how that Satan would become the god
[1:38:19] of the evil age the god elected by the
[1:38:22] people in worship
[1:38:25] no age has had to face that no age has
[1:38:29] ever had to face the days of Noah and
[1:38:33] the days of lot
[1:38:37] simultaneously we have to face them
[1:38:41] simultaneously you understand this is a
[1:38:44] unique hour no wonder God sent a unique
[1:38:47] word with a unique Ministry to give you
[1:38:49] a unique
[1:38:51] experience say is it different it's a
[1:38:54] restoration of the original and and so
[1:38:57] when brother brandham comes out of that
[1:39:00] he says now if your house is like my
[1:39:03] house he said by that time he said I'd
[1:39:05] gotten up very early and he said I came
[1:39:07] to in my study and I said Lord what does
[1:39:09] this mean and he said the next thing I
[1:39:11] hear I hear alarms going off Ma's
[1:39:14] getting up she's getting the kids
[1:39:15] everybody's getting ready for school he
[1:39:17] said if if your house is like my house
[1:39:19] he said it's you can't even hear
[1:39:20] yourself think and he said I'm walking
[1:39:22] around trying to help you time to get up
[1:39:24] time to get ready breakfast is being
[1:39:25] cooked children where's my book bag
[1:39:27] where's my clothes where's get out of
[1:39:29] the bathroom you know I need in there
[1:39:31] all the kind of stuff and brother
[1:39:32] brandham says he said I I just couldn't
[1:39:35] hear myself think and he said I I
[1:39:37] slipped back in and closed the door and
[1:39:38] he said I got down and I said Lord Jesus
[1:39:40] in just a little bit they're going to
[1:39:42] call for me I got to take the kids to
[1:39:43] school Lord I I got to know what this
[1:39:45] means it's very troubling what what does
[1:39:48] this mean please help me quickly and he
[1:39:50] says that and and he says now I don't
[1:39:52] like to do this
[1:39:53] he says but and he tells all this in
[1:39:55] Paradox 61 and he says I don't like to
[1:39:57] do this we don't like to fleece God like
[1:39:59] that he said but I remember back in the
[1:40:01] day when I'd open my bible and it go
[1:40:03] right to Joshua 9 and he said and he
[1:40:05] told me just as he had been with Moses
[1:40:08] he'd be with me and nothing will stand
[1:40:10] before you and footsteps mean possession
[1:40:12] and all that all that all that and
[1:40:14] brother brandom said for years he said
[1:40:16] it didn't matter he said I could be in
[1:40:17] front of anybody and he said I just open
[1:40:19] my bible and it open right there to
[1:40:20] Joshua and he says now he said I
[1:40:23] remembered he said Lord I don't like
[1:40:25] doing it this way but I'm in a I I'm in
[1:40:28] desperate I'm in a hurry because of Life
[1:40:30] can you please help me and he said I
[1:40:32] didn't look and he said I just turned
[1:40:34] and he said I just went like that and I
[1:40:35] looked and he said I was pointing at 1
[1:40:38] Corinthians 58 where we read our text
[1:40:40] this
[1:40:42] morning and our and and the point that
[1:40:44] he read was he says Purge out therefore
[1:40:48] the old leaven that you may be a new
[1:40:50] lump as ye are unleavened for even
[1:40:54] Christ Our Passover is sacrificed for us
[1:40:58] see therefore let us keep the feast not
[1:41:02] with old leaven neither with the leaven
[1:41:05] of malice and wickedness but with the
[1:41:07] unleavened bread of sincerity and
[1:41:09] Truth see because brother brandham had
[1:41:12] been told in the vision when you see
[1:41:14] this Mamba and you're able to bind him
[1:41:17] like that he said now you're going to
[1:41:19] have to be more sincere than you have
[1:41:24] been wow and that blows my mind yeah and
[1:41:29] it does yours and I'm thinking every
[1:41:31] time I read that as a boy I thought
[1:41:32] goodness gracious what more could he
[1:41:36] do and and if he hasn't been sincere of
[1:41:40] what in the world am I going to do the
[1:41:42] friend who it's gone after and I'm
[1:41:45] jumping all in one strike and I'm gone
[1:41:48] how if a prophet isn't sincere enough
[1:41:50] but brother brandham comes back now he's
[1:41:53] getting getting the interpretation and
[1:41:55] the Lord is telling him that the the
[1:41:57] interpretation is the
[1:41:59] word that this is how you're going to
[1:42:03] achieve the sincerity that you need not
[1:42:06] because you're going to have to suffer
[1:42:08] more or talk in lower tones or be even
[1:42:10] more humble than you've already been or
[1:42:12] give away you know more of your goods
[1:42:14] it's not about that it's that we're at
[1:42:16] the end time in a unique hour when a
[1:42:18] unique word is coming and you're going
[1:42:20] to believe that word and your belief and
[1:42:23] that word is going to give you the
[1:42:25] sincerity you need to operate this
[1:42:27] principle Hallelujah come on so when he
[1:42:31] comes in this age you're going to need
[1:42:33] this message and it's going to need to
[1:42:35] be a
[1:42:38] revelation amen it's going to have to be
[1:42:41] something real it can't just be Doctrine
[1:42:44] it can't just be books and tapes and
[1:42:46] quotes it's a person and it's got to
[1:42:48] live inside you that's the only way
[1:42:51] you're going to be able to bind him and
[1:42:52] lose same
[1:42:55] Hallelujah and and and and we find that
[1:42:59] it's the sincerity you can't come with
[1:43:01] the old leaven see you can't come in
[1:43:04] other words there's two principles
[1:43:05] showing here and here's what I'm I'm
[1:43:06] going to run out of time but I want to
[1:43:08] just give you this there's two
[1:43:10] principles that he's talking about when
[1:43:12] he says you know your your Christ is now
[1:43:15] uh for even Christ Our Passover sacrific
[1:43:18] for us Purge out therefore the old
[1:43:19] leaven that you might be a new lump for
[1:43:22] ye are unleavened
[1:43:23] that so I don't have time today I'll get
[1:43:25] to it later we'll look at the we'll look
[1:43:27] at the feast days of Israel because he
[1:43:29] was the unleavened bread then he was the
[1:43:32] he was the Passover then he was the
[1:43:34] first fruits and then Pentecost and
[1:43:35] Pentecost runs all the way to the
[1:43:37] Rapture and then the the last three
[1:43:39] trumpets five six and seven go to Israel
[1:43:41] and so that's why the the Jubilee that's
[1:43:44] why the token had to come back full
[1:43:46] strength today so that the Omega could
[1:43:50] be the alpha Hallelujah only the alpha
[1:43:53] fell and
[1:43:54] backslid and they were already
[1:43:56] backsliding when Paul is writing to them
[1:43:58] he says look there's fornication among
[1:44:00] you don't be proud of this is terrible
[1:44:02] you need to take that man out from under
[1:44:03] the blood the ending of the story is
[1:44:06] they did and he repented and everything
[1:44:07] got fixed and he got restored later but
[1:44:10] but but but the church was already
[1:44:13] backsliding the church was
[1:44:16] already going
[1:44:18] carnal they were already watering down
[1:44:22] the
[1:44:23] Doctrine they were already contemplating
[1:44:27] you know you had the Deeds of the
[1:44:28] nicians you had the spirit of balum you
[1:44:30] had all of this thing moving among them
[1:44:33] and they started getting this idea that
[1:44:35] if they were in our modern day it would
[1:44:37] have to be titled message
[1:44:40] light already had started watering it
[1:44:43] down and he's saying you can't do that
[1:44:46] because the only thing that can make you
[1:44:48] from old leev of sin when you had when
[1:44:52] you had uh malice and wickedness you
[1:44:55] you've got to become a new lump and the
[1:44:58] only way to do that the only way to get
[1:44:59] the token is don't water the message
[1:45:02] down you got to have the
[1:45:05] unleavened the unleavened means no
[1:45:08] contamination it's unleavened there's no
[1:45:10] man-made thinking in
[1:45:13] it and so that see that's the mistake
[1:45:17] that they kept making in the ages wow it
[1:45:20] wasn't then it didn't become just a
[1:45:21] sinful just like when you at the pyramid
[1:45:23] it's an individual but it's also the
[1:45:24] ages amen so so Not only was it a
[1:45:28] message to individuals but now that as
[1:45:31] an age what they what they kept doing
[1:45:33] was was he they they it says here Purge
[1:45:36] out therefore the 11 that you may be a
[1:45:38] new lump for your unle for even Christ
[1:45:40] Our Passover sacrificed for us this is
[1:45:42] why we need the pure word this is why we
[1:45:44] can't have message light this is why you
[1:45:46] can't move the ancient landmarks this is
[1:45:48] why you can't make 2024 and fill it full
[1:45:51] of all kinds of carnal and exceptions to
[1:45:54] a message that ended in' 65 cuz it
[1:45:56] didn't end in
[1:45:57] 65 but it's the original word and you
[1:46:00] got to stay with it because it's
[1:46:05] unleavened but see here's what they did
[1:46:08] therefore let us keep the feast not with
[1:46:11] old leaven neither with the leav of
[1:46:13] malice see this is where brother
[1:46:15] brandham said this is what they did that
[1:46:17] a seal partially broke and a mystery
[1:46:20] dropped and a messenger caught it and
[1:46:22] ran with it and it gathered a bride and
[1:46:25] then he went off the scene and then
[1:46:27] Ricky and ricettas got in there and
[1:46:30] organized it all and what what were they
[1:46:32] doing that was the malice they didn't
[1:46:35] want that pure word anymore they they
[1:46:37] were against it and they begin to
[1:46:39] denominate it it was all the
[1:46:41] Antichrist and we've come to the last
[1:46:43] age here the most unique hour and you
[1:46:46] and and this is Satan's attempt is even
[1:46:48] to move among God's family and try to
[1:46:51] get them to water down the message and
[1:46:53] water down the word that's the same
[1:46:56] Spirit of antichrist that operated in
[1:46:58] the ages but you've got to be an
[1:47:00] unleavened
[1:47:02] bride you can't run with that system
[1:47:04] anymore the old leaven that that old way
[1:47:08] of doing it doesn't work anymore oh
[1:47:12] Christ has become My
[1:47:14] Sacrifice Christ has become the Living
[1:47:17] Word and it's a token life that is
[1:47:20] living inside of our lives living inside
[1:47:23] of our homes guiding us so that we're
[1:47:26] not we're not beset by all the
[1:47:32] noise this is why God brought it to a
[1:47:34] prophet at the end time and took him
[1:47:36] back to First Corinthians
[1:47:38] 5 and said now you'll have to be more
[1:47:41] sincere to have this kind of power say
[1:47:45] well what's up with that kind of power
[1:47:48] you're going to need it for what's
[1:47:51] coming not only what's coming what was
[1:47:54] coming in
[1:47:56] 1961 but what is here
[1:48:00] now I think about the
[1:48:03] sincerity and it's preaching from my
[1:48:06] heart I think about the levels of
[1:48:10] sincerity that I've seen come into
[1:48:12] people's lives just on National tragedy
[1:48:15] that's a good topic because yesterday I
[1:48:19] I told you that I looked at a
[1:48:20] headline and the headline before I left
[1:48:23] to come to church was are we on the
[1:48:25] brink of global
[1:48:28] war cuz now you got a Sovereign Nation
[1:48:31] not a proxy you've got a Sovereign
[1:48:33] Nation attacking Israel and Israel had
[1:48:36] already said you know it's nothing
[1:48:38] hezbollah's been sending rockets at us
[1:48:40] okay fine so is Hamas we're not going to
[1:48:42] attack Iran for that we're going to bomb
[1:48:44] Syria because they house them we're
[1:48:46] going to invade the Gaza and we're going
[1:48:49] to put them down but we're not going to
[1:48:50] attack AR we know they're sending them
[1:48:52] the missile and the rockets and the
[1:48:53] drones but they're not personally
[1:48:56] attacking us they're doing through
[1:48:57] proxies however if they personally
[1:49:00] attack us then we will
[1:49:03] retaliate and last night in the face of
[1:49:06] that Iran a Sovereign Nation sends about
[1:49:10] 300 they first start sending drones and
[1:49:13] then they start sending cruise missiles
[1:49:16] and then they start sending ballistic
[1:49:18] missiles you
[1:49:23] who was no there was no natural you can
[1:49:26] see that it's it's all it's all that
[1:49:29] demonic Islam because there was the
[1:49:32] brother JD can tell you there was no
[1:49:33] historic Rift between the Jews and the
[1:49:36] Persians the Persians took them out out
[1:49:39] from the Babylonians and the Persians
[1:49:41] and there was a Persian king Cyrus who
[1:49:42] let him go back and build a tabernacle
[1:49:44] build a temple so it was it wasn't until
[1:49:48] 1979 when the islamist took over Iran
[1:49:51] that then they started stating we need
[1:49:52] to annihilate Israel and this hatred
[1:49:54] begin it's been going for 40 years it's
[1:49:56] not a it's not a Jewish Persian thing
[1:49:58] it's a Hebrew Islamic thing and now
[1:50:02] you've got America saying you know we're
[1:50:04] going to defend and then you get Russia
[1:50:06] jumping in saying if America does the
[1:50:09] least little thing to Iran they need to
[1:50:12] know we will come to the support of our
[1:50:14] friends I'm here to tell you something
[1:50:16] friends you're on this world's on
[1:50:17] sinking sand and this thing is coming
[1:50:20] apart and God is knowing
[1:50:23] that the greatest thing right now is
[1:50:25] this delusion in the minds to take the
[1:50:27] message and make it a light version and
[1:50:29] water it down and disregarded and
[1:50:31] changed the ancient landmarks you'll
[1:50:33] never get the token like that and if you
[1:50:35] don't get the token you won't get out of
[1:50:36] here you'll go down with Ash and Cinder
[1:50:38] with it I promise you only those who are
[1:50:40] part of the first resurrection leave the
[1:50:42] Earth Hallelujah and that's what I want
[1:50:45] to be part of and God has sent a word
[1:50:47] that can bring you into the first
[1:50:49] resurrection and make you a new lump not
[1:50:51] an old Le not not the old way not your
[1:50:53] old Sins not the old way of the ages of
[1:50:57] of of waiting for the messenger to go
[1:50:58] away and then you come later on and you
[1:51:01] start criticizing him and tearing him
[1:51:02] down and start preaching a water down
[1:51:04] version and start drawing people out
[1:51:07] nonsense those people are going to end
[1:51:08] up in a tribulation God's their judge
[1:51:11] but I'm I'm headed home in a body change
[1:51:15] because I'm a new lump Christ my
[1:51:17] Passover is an unleavened lump
[1:51:20] Hallelujah is that the kind of word that
[1:51:22] you want today I want to be an
[1:51:24] unleavened lump I want to be have an
[1:51:26] unleavened God an unleavened word
[1:51:29] something that can permeate my home and
[1:51:31] permeate my mind and permeate the lives
[1:51:34] of my family who I love oh let's stand
[1:51:37] to our feet friends I'm completely out
[1:51:39] of time but this this is the burden of
[1:51:42] my heart today this was where God sent a
[1:51:45] prophet back to you're going to need
[1:51:48] this kind of power and he knew that in
[1:51:51] 1961
[1:51:53] where are
[1:51:55] you and I've seen as I said I've seen
[1:51:59] sincerity right now we've got a national
[1:52:03] crisis right
[1:52:06] now they're
[1:52:07] saying wow they didn't just fire
[1:52:11] drones they fired cruise missiles that's
[1:52:14] that's next level then they did the
[1:52:16] unthinkable they fired ballistic
[1:52:18] missiles hard to detect hard to hit if
[1:52:21] they had been nuclear tipped this would
[1:52:22] be a whole different
[1:52:24] morning and they want nuclear
[1:52:28] weapons for their it's one thing for
[1:52:31] them to claim it's just for energy and
[1:52:32] and then out of the other side of their
[1:52:33] mouth they're saying we want the
[1:52:34] annihilation of Israel yeah how do you
[1:52:36] figure that
[1:52:38] working like Brother JD said the song
[1:52:40] from The River To The Sea what happens
[1:52:42] to Israel I can tell you what happens to
[1:52:44] them they don't
[1:52:45] exist that's that's not the Mandate of
[1:52:48] people there are those Arab people are
[1:52:50] some of the I've met Arab Muslims some
[1:52:54] of the most noble honest trustworthy
[1:52:56] people I've walked through Arab
[1:52:58] countries and meet some woman in her 20s
[1:53:01] walking down a back alley at 3 in the
[1:53:03] morning we're coming home for meetings
[1:53:04] and we pass her in an alley nobody's
[1:53:06] touching her she's not afraid because
[1:53:08] they know what would
[1:53:09] happen and and in one way they're more
[1:53:12] righteous than the nauseating not
[1:53:14] righteousness of so-called Christianity
[1:53:16] which isn't righteousness at all it's
[1:53:18] not even Christianity at all it's
[1:53:21] nonsense for make it don't have anything
[1:53:24] to do with it we're not talking about
[1:53:25] the people we're talking about we have
[1:53:28] brothers and sisters who were of that
[1:53:31] who are now Believers of this message
[1:53:34] it's the C Gene goes all around the
[1:53:35] world thank God thank God Hallelujah we
[1:53:39] I'm talking about the people I'm not
[1:53:41] here in support of Pharisees say you
[1:53:44] don't support Israel of course I do true
[1:53:46] Israel I don't support Pharisees th
[1:53:49] those when those when those CI guys die
[1:53:52] I and I see the headline they blew up
[1:53:54] this terrorist they blew up this
[1:53:55] terrorist I just can't stop myself from
[1:53:57] saying welcome to Hell there you go
[1:54:00] surprise but you know who they're down
[1:54:02] there with
[1:54:04] Pharisees Sadducees they're down there
[1:54:07] with people Through the Ages who
[1:54:08] rejected the message of their
[1:54:10] hour this is not about some nationalist
[1:54:13] spirit this is about an allegiance to
[1:54:16] the lamb this is about an allegiance to
[1:54:19] righteousness and the and the unleavened
[1:54:22] bread
[1:54:23] sincerity and I've seen people get very
[1:54:26] sincere for a while they're very sincere
[1:54:28] right now we saw it I you know I I
[1:54:32] remember being sitting in a church
[1:54:33] service just like this except it's a
[1:54:35] Wednesday night or might have been a
[1:54:36] Sunday night it's a night
[1:54:37] service I think it was a Sunday
[1:54:40] night and no one knew well as soon as we
[1:54:44] got there church just started up
[1:54:46] everybody was at church we didn't have
[1:54:48] cell phones and things like we have
[1:54:49] today nobody was texting in church back
[1:54:52] then in like they shouldn't be
[1:54:54] today
[1:54:56] and and suddenly the preacher comes out
[1:54:59] preaches whole sermon he preaches
[1:55:01] invasion of the USA takes it from
[1:55:03] Brother bram's
[1:55:05] 195 seven or eight six something like
[1:55:08] that invasion of the USA very good
[1:55:10] sermon and it comes to the end and
[1:55:12] everybody's just a just a Sunday night
[1:55:14] service and everybody's enjoyed it we're
[1:55:15] getting ready to be dismissed church is
[1:55:17] full of like this got young people
[1:55:19] middle people older people
[1:55:22] and he says now I didn't want to say it
[1:55:24] at the beginning of the service and he
[1:55:26] knew none of us knew it because we
[1:55:27] didn't have that kind of
[1:55:29] technology and he just says now I didn't
[1:55:32] want to say it before the church before
[1:55:34] the service he said but he said the war
[1:55:38] has started this was the Gulf War in 91
[1:55:41] and he said the war has started and he
[1:55:45] if he hadn't said it like this he said
[1:55:47] the bomb has been
[1:55:49] dropped and everybody was like he just
[1:55:52] felt everybody freeze and he said the
[1:55:54] war's on y'all it's happening right now
[1:55:56] bombs are
[1:55:58] falling and he and he looked to the back
[1:56:00] and he called out a brother brother
[1:56:02] you're supposed to call your mother
[1:56:03] right away I had a message sister so and
[1:56:05] so right away your husband he's
[1:56:06] unbeliever he wants you to call him
[1:56:07] straight away and all of a sudden you
[1:56:10] hear people start crying young people
[1:56:13] who hadn't moved under the spirit of God
[1:56:15] in years suddenly jumped out in the
[1:56:18] aisle and ran to the altar fell at an
[1:56:21] altar screaming crying to God for
[1:56:24] Mercy I thought why did it take
[1:56:28] that and more than half the ones who
[1:56:31] fell and cried for Mercy once they
[1:56:34] realized it wasn't a nuclear bomb and we
[1:56:36] won it in six days anyhow then suddenly
[1:56:39] they went right back to the
[1:56:42] world I saw them get all sincere in
[1:56:46] 911 and the whole nation I remember a
[1:56:49] preacher said one time he said isn't it
[1:56:51] amazing the the the from the White House
[1:56:53] Down they're saying everybody needs to
[1:56:54] be praying and the whole nation is
[1:56:56] praying but nobody's
[1:56:57] repenting there's a big difference
[1:56:59] between praying and
[1:57:01] repenting and nobody was repenting and
[1:57:03] after a while they stopped
[1:57:05] praying and and what does it take listen
[1:57:07] I don't want some national catastrophe
[1:57:09] to make me sincere I want to come under
[1:57:12] the presence of the word of God today
[1:57:14] young people you need to be sincere you
[1:57:16] need to bring the unleavened bread of
[1:57:18] sincerity stop flirting around with the
[1:57:21] world stop accepting a watered down
[1:57:24] message stop accepting the carnality
[1:57:26] that is clearly outside of the bounds of
[1:57:29] the word of God we're a church who wants
[1:57:31] the power of God we want the
[1:57:34] Sovereign authority of God I want the
[1:57:37] knowledge of God we don't want I want
[1:57:39] Holiness I want righteousness I want
[1:57:42] sincerity in my life and your life and
[1:57:47] we're not here to use the old malice the
[1:57:50] old way of the ages that's what the
[1:57:52] scripture is saying don't go back and be
[1:57:54] a sinner anymore but hey you age don't
[1:57:57] go back and do like the ages did because
