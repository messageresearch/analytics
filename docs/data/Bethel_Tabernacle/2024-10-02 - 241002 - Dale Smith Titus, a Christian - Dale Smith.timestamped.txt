[31:36] way Lord we realize there is
[31:39] still a blood band around this Earth

[32:14] that shikina
[32:17] glory Lord where
[32:19] things

[32:27] evening
[32:28] in your
[32:30] presence Lord as we are very
[32:36] Mindful and very careful to give you all
[32:40] the thanks
[32:42] and

[32:51] it the church
[32:53] said God bless you have your seats this
[32:56] evening
[33:04] just kind of I want to run around and
[33:07] hug everybody's neck but we'll wait till
[33:10] after church for all those
[33:13] things but the most important thing that
[33:17] we can do this
[33:19] evening is to receive the engrafted word
[33:22] of God into our souls and uh we
[33:26] just believe that God has maybe just a
[33:30] little something for us as uh we get
[33:34] started
[33:37] uh where
[33:40] um so first of all we have here the
[33:43] Apostle Paul as
[33:46] our first age messenger and as in his
[33:52] office he was the he he broke the from
[33:58] the Old Testament and brought us into
[34:02] the modern era the Christian
[34:05] era and in doing so he brought a word
[34:08] that would then as we know from the
[34:10] church age book set the precedent for
[34:12] all other ages and that we would be able
[34:15] to use the message of the Apostle as the
[34:21] as the The Matrix for all other
[34:25] Messengers unto our time and so that
[34:28] even we ourselves would then be able to
[34:32] uh know if our gospel was correct or
[34:37] that if our uh if we were in line with
[34:41] the mind of God because we know that the
[34:43] Bible the word of God is God's mind it's
[34:46] the and so as we want to make sure that
[34:51] everything that we do is supported by
[34:55] the the the truth of God's word so
[34:59] so we find here that Paul then sets his
[35:02] uh criteria or his qualifications and
[35:06] credentials here in this first three
[35:09] verses he tells how that he was an
[35:11] apostle and that it was according to the
[35:13] faith of God's elect it was based upon
[35:16] the hope of eternal life amen which uh
[35:19] from God who cannot lie and that it was
[35:22] given unto him
[35:24] amen by the Commandment of God and now
[35:29] he's going to address this uh uh these
[35:32] criteria or these these credentials and
[35:36] he's going to now hand this over to a
[35:38] five-fold minister all right to the
[35:40] apost to to to Titus now Titus here uh
[35:45] we'll find a little bit later uh what
[35:47] his what the what the purpose was for
[35:50] Titus but we we find here that he says
[35:53] to Titus mine own son after the common
[35:57] faith and so here was this this this
[36:00] individual that we uh we want to look at
[36:04] this evening just for a a moment because
[36:07] there's some things here that need to be
[36:09] established now to Titus we realize that
[36:13] uh he was going to I want to go on down
[36:16] here and read just for a second here in
[36:19] verse 5 he said for this cause left I
[36:23] Thee
[36:24] Inc that thou shouldest
[36:29] preach my church order
[36:32] book that you're going to take the
[36:34] church order message the conduct order
[36:37] and Doctrine and you're going to teach
[36:39] it to these uh people that are in cre to
[36:42] set things in
[36:44] order the things which are uh uh are
[36:48] wanting and uh ordain Elders in every
[36:52] city as I have appointed thee so now
[36:54] then here was going to be Titus he was
[36:56] going he was under the uh the
[36:59] jurisdiction and the instruction of the
[37:02] first church age messenger and he was
[37:04] going to come in and he was going to
[37:06] preach he was going to teach he was
[37:08] going to set in order he was going to do
[37:11] these things to the local uh areas
[37:13] wherever he was going to be sent in the
[37:15] local area of cre
[37:18] now the name
[37:22] Titus is uh is
[37:25] interesting because it's going to to
[37:29] identify each and every one of
[37:32] us together amen and because the name
[37:36] Titus
[37:38] simply means a Christian all right the
[37:42] Lord it means uh it's a title of Honor
[37:47] that's what it means it's no there's no
[37:50] uh uh there's no real deep mystery here
[37:55] it just means it just means a Christian
[37:58] you can look it up in your strong
[38:00] concordance and it will tell you that
[38:03] Titus means a Christian amen and uh
[38:06] that's what its definition is it also
[38:09] refers to a or a title of honor and so
[38:14] the name Christian becomes this title of
[38:19] Honor that we each and everyone can
[38:22] attach to our own self so it would be uh
[38:26] uh uh Tito
[38:28] which was the the the the Roman or the
[38:30] Greek uh derivative of it and then it
[38:33] had he would have maybe two or three
[38:35] other names behind that that was the
[38:37] Roman custom of that time so uh uh we
[38:41] would be uh titos Dale Smith or put your
[38:46] name there however you would want to do
[38:48] it means Christian it means somebody uh
[38:51] a title of honor the Bible tells us over
[38:55] in the book of Acts chapter 11 that the
[38:58] disciples were uh called Christians
[39:02] first in Antioch so here was this this
[39:05] title that was given now we realize then
[39:08] that that title by the uh by the uh
[39:13] antiochian uh that they that was
[39:15] actually a like what brother brandom
[39:18] said that the devil hung a name on the
[39:20] Christian today called him Holy Roller
[39:24] he said that's a that's a de that's a
[39:26] title that the devil hung on Believers
[39:29] and so this this uh this name uh uh
[39:34] Christos or uh christianos or Christians
[39:38] as we would call it that it was actually
[39:42] a slang name that was just thrown out
[39:44] there to like herodian or uh uh you know
[39:48] any uh uh the the aristocrates or the
[39:51] different ones that it was just a name
[39:53] that was just thrown out there uh
[39:55] because of their association with uh
[39:59] with the one that was called Christ now
[40:02] from McLaren's expositions I want to
[40:04] read this little commentary is quite
[40:06] interesting to me it says that uh the
[40:11] speaking of the Christians he says there
[40:13] success of their work in Antioch amongst
[40:15] the pure Heathen population has for its
[40:19] crowning uh attestation is this that it
[40:24] compelled the Curiosity hunting pleasure
[40:27] loving
[40:28] sarcastic antiochian to find a new name
[40:32] for this new thing to write out a label
[40:36] for the new bottles and to which the new
[40:38] wine was being put
[40:40] in clearly the name shows that the
[40:43] church was beginning to attract the
[40:46] attention of
[40:48] Outsiders and so we realized then so
[40:51] they just had to throw a name out there
[40:53] because they couldn't call them Jews
[40:55] they couldn't call them Greeks they
[40:57] couldn't call them Romans they had to
[40:59] come up with some kind of a name because
[41:01] they didn't fit any of the molds that
[41:03] was uh that was out there for the time
[41:06] and so they called them Christians now
[41:09] we had a messenger come in our day that
[41:11] tells us that Christian means Christlike
[41:14] in other words they had been in the in
[41:17] the uh uh in the near
[41:20] proximity uh to to Christ they had they
[41:23] they they even they told said that of
[41:26] Peter that we they they realized that
[41:29] because he was ignorant and unlearned
[41:32] but that he had been around this one
[41:35] Jesus of Nazareth because the the the
[41:38] scripture tells us that his speech had
[41:41] betrayed
[41:43] him and so as we look at this uh uh this
[41:47] this Christian this this
[41:51] Titus that Paul then tells him here uh
[41:57] we we want to come down to chapter two
[42:01] that when we come to chapter 2 now we
[42:03] could spend a lot of time on chapter one
[42:05] because he's dealing with ministers he
[42:07] said now then tell Titus he said now
[42:09] then Titus I want you to go and ordain
[42:11] Elders I want you to teach them things I
[42:13] want you to tell them that they have to
[42:14] be the husband of one wife that they
[42:16] have to have be blameless that they have
[42:18] to have you know all these criteria that
[42:20] this is what's going to be the
[42:21] credentials of any uh uh of any uh Elder
[42:26] that you're going to ordained and we
[42:27] could spend a lot of time preaching on
[42:29] you on the preachers tonight we've got a
[42:32] few of them and it would be good for us
[42:33] to probably spend some time lining their
[42:35] wheels up but we we'll leave that up to
[42:38] brother Jason and so uh uh but then we
[42:42] come down here into chapter 2 and verse
[42:45] one and it says speak thou the things
[42:49] which become sound Doctrine now you will
[42:53] find that here in the first two chapters
[42:56] uh that
[42:57] the that Paul uses this language of
[43:01] soundness and that's kind of where I
[43:03] want to kind of Labor uh for a good
[43:06] while here this evening and we'll we'll
[43:08] let you out uh before very long we won't
[43:11] keep you real
[43:13] late you know so I didn't put time on
[43:15] that and I said for uh uh I told that to
[43:19] brother Homer long gory one time he said
[43:21] You Preach as long as you want to we go
[43:23] home at 9ine and so so we
[43:27] uh
[43:29] so so might be here by myself you never
[43:33] know and so uh so he says here uh at
[43:37] different places like in in uh in verse
[43:40] n he talks about uh uh sound Doctrine uh
[43:45] he also goes down in verse 13 and talks
[43:47] about sound in faith and and and in in
[43:51] in chap in chapter 2 verse two he says
[43:54] uh repeats that sound Faith verse 8 uh
[43:57] sound speech so this this language of
[44:00] soundness this this sound uh Doctrine is
[44:05] the doctrine or the the admonition that
[44:09] Paul gave to the
[44:11] Christian and and so I believe that that
[44:15] being the the the order of all ages to
[44:19] follow that that we have been also
[44:22] instructed by the scripture by the
[44:24] message of the hour we could use maybe
[44:26] different langu language but we would we
[44:28] would have to come back to this that it
[44:31] would be uh that that the things that we
[44:34] believe the things that we say the
[44:37] things that we uh that we believe must
[44:40] come from sound teaching Doctrine means
[44:46] teaching the word there that is used in
[44:49] the Greek text is uh
[44:53] hayano uh and also it comes back to I
[44:57] think the actual word of soundness there
[45:00] is hugoh or Hugo and so uh the word
[45:06] there is where we get our word of
[45:09] hygiene all right so sound
[45:13] Doctrine uh equates to h a
[45:17] hygienic or a a a sterile not sterile
[45:21] but like clean like like uh like uh uh
[45:26] prot protected and so here it is Hyo the
[45:31] root of the English word hygiene it
[45:35] literally means when we speak of the
[45:38] word sound
[45:39] Doctrine properly in good working order
[45:44] all right all right so he says you're
[45:46] going to teach these people a doctrine
[45:50] that works hello you're going to teach
[45:53] these people a a a a a do a faith a
[45:58] speech that has a that functions that
[46:02] literally will get the job done all
[46:06] right that will that will bring out the
[46:10] um uh the the the the intended purpose
[46:14] yes Hallelujah not just to scratch the
[46:17] ears not just to entice with men's
[46:21] teachings but that will literally will
[46:24] go down into the soul and begin to
[46:28] convict and begin to stir somebody to
[46:31] live a clean life because it's
[46:35] hygienic it's going to it's it's going
[46:38] to it's going to clean you up
[46:41] hallelujah oh my I I I I I I saw that
[46:45] word that it meant uh uh meant it was uh
[46:50] hooy or Huggy I thought well that's like
[46:54] diapers them Huggy diapers
[46:58] that's
[46:59] hygienic Hallelujah so maybe we need
[47:01] some uh you know some some some some of
[47:04] that to you know keep us
[47:07] clean I just thought I'd throw that out
[47:11] there now now so it's a uh it it means
[47:16] in good working order hence healthy amen
[47:21] sound Doctrine is healthy Doctrine it's
[47:25] going to keep you clean it means in
[47:29] sound condition or balance you know you
[47:34] think about you know it's not brother m
[47:36] talked about uh uh the uh the you know
[47:39] the medicine he said it's got a certain
[47:40] amount of poison to kill the germ but
[47:43] then it's you know he said but can't
[47:45] have too much it's got to have some
[47:46] medicine it's got to have some poison
[47:48] what it's got to have a balance to it oh
[47:51] my let me say let me tell you something
[47:53] the the the the word of God in its
[47:56] correct dosage it will it will it will
[47:59] cure what ills you Hallelujah and it
[48:03] will clean you up praise be to
[48:07] God it means to be free from
[48:11] debilitation or handicap or
[48:14] incapacity oh my we're talking about a
[48:17] Doctrine a a a a a a sound speech and
[48:21] sound teaching that it it functions
[48:25] holistically
[48:27] all right hallelujah it's not something
[48:29] that was concocted out of some
[48:32] pharmaceutical laboratory but this is
[48:35] something that's that's going to be uh
[48:37] uh holistic it's going to be uh uh uh uh
[48:41] some of those uh some of those essential
[48:45] oils
[48:47] Hallelujah my this is this is the kind
[48:50] of message that we need something that's
[48:52] going to actually uh have remediation
[48:56] it's going to it's going to treat what's
[48:59] wrong with you in a way that will get
[49:02] the right kind of results and not have
[49:04] all kinds of perverted side effects and
[49:09] denominational vulture
[49:12] ideas hallelujah oh my uh and I really
[49:17] like this that it's that it's
[49:19] functioning holistically with all parts
[49:23] working
[49:25] together my you think about that that
[49:28] it's not it's not just one running off
[49:30] this way and one running off that way
[49:32] but it's Synergy it's something that's
[49:34] working together to produce the desired
[49:39] effects and so we we we we come to the
[49:43] message of the hour and you're going to
[49:44] say my brother Dale you just went
[49:46] shallow you went your wagon's full or
[49:50] wagons empty tonight well that's all
[49:52] right I just believe in a simple gospel
[49:56] I believe in something that you can take
[49:58] home with you something that you can put
[50:00] on Amen in the morning when you go to
[50:03] work yes sir Amen brother Bram says here
[50:06] give me your
[50:08] undivided attention for just a few
[50:11] minutes I I like that kind of attention
[50:15] it's undivided when you get some people
[50:17] their attentions you know they're add at
[50:19] church you know they're thinking about
[50:21] this and that and they're going every
[50:23] direction no no just give me your
[50:25] undivided attention for the next little
[50:28] bit here uh for a few
[50:31] moments these are the some of these
[50:34] bullet points are direct in line with
[50:36] each other some of them I took out out
[50:38] of different sermons but here we got oh
[50:41] I don't know there's four seven in a row
[50:43] that brother brandom just just just
[50:45] fires them off one right after the other
[50:48] and he starts here I
[50:52] believe and so when we're talking about
[50:55] sound Doctrine
[50:57] and we we we find here that Paul was
[51:01] given these instructions to give
[51:04] to Timothy he used some of the same
[51:07] language to Timothy he uses some of the
[51:09] same Lang to language to Titus uh and
[51:13] and so here we we find that this that
[51:16] that he said this was given to me by God
[51:19] this is information this is this is the
[51:22] instructions the teachings that I was
[51:25] given by God hallelujah and so then we
[51:29] come down Seven Ages later we find that
[51:33] Paul being a prophet we find that
[51:36] William Brandon was a prophet the
[51:38] prophet walks out he begins to give us
[51:40] the things that he
[51:43] believed and I believe that's sound I
[51:46] believe that works how do I know it
[51:48] works because dead people came out Rose
[51:52] to their feet cancers fell off of people
[51:55] eyes came into their sockets and then he
[51:58] could pray what color they wanted the
[52:00] deaf here the lame walked amen arms and
[52:04] and and and things began to uh uh
[52:07] stretch forth in the name of the Holy
[52:10] son Jesus and brother bradam said give
[52:13] me your underd divided attention for a
[52:15] few minutes he said I believe in the
[52:20] resurrection I believe in it now then
[52:24] we're going to clarify I believe in a
[52:27] spiritual Resurrection I believe that
[52:30] you and I are walking in resurrection
[52:32] power my Bible says that if the same
[52:35] spirit that raised up Jesus from the
[52:38] dead dwell in you it will Quicken your
[52:41] mortal I'm talking about your living
[52:44] your the body that you're living in
[52:46] right now it will Quicken it to the same
[52:49] resurrection power that was in Jesus
[52:52] Christ Hallelujah brother I believe in
[52:55] the resurrection
[52:57] I believe in the bodily physical
[53:01] Resurrection am so he makes a
[53:03] distinction I believe in a supernatural
[53:06] resurrection of the soul and of the
[53:08] spirit man that'll make you walk in the
[53:13] in the in the power and to be called a
[53:16] Son of God that you can whether you uh
[53:20] uh experience a a body change or if you
[53:24] go by way of the Grave is a
[53:27] irrelevant Hallelujah that you can live
[53:30] in
[53:32] Resurrection he called it quickening
[53:34] power he called it many other things he
[53:37] said but I believe in the bodily
[53:39] physical Resurrection I'm not
[53:41] spiritualizing these things to the point
[53:44] that we can't look forward to a uh to a
[53:47] body change that we can't look forward
[53:49] to a to a time when we'll see our loved
[53:52] ones a walking Among Us I believe
[53:54] there's going to come a time amen we're
[53:56] going to feel a sweeping and and young
[53:59] men are going to become old uh older uh
[54:02] mature men and women and old men and old
[54:07] women are going to experience youngness
[54:09] again I believe we're going to be all
[54:11] about the same age and the same strength
[54:14] and the perfect and figure of Health I
[54:16] believe in a physical
[54:19] Resurrection where we'll see our loved
[54:21] ones come Among
[54:23] Us he says I believe in the
[54:27] physical bodily return of Jesus
[54:31] Christ well I believe in a in a in a
[54:34] word return as well I believe he's
[54:36] appeared Among Us I believe that the the
[54:38] person of Christ has come in 1963 on
[54:42] Sunset mountain and revealed to a
[54:44] Vindicated Prophet amen the message that
[54:47] would Quicken our mortal bodies I
[54:50] believe I believe in a supernatural uh
[54:52] coming of Christ in a word form but I
[54:55] also so believe that that same Jesus
[54:59] that they saw go away in that day I say
[55:02] why stand you there gazing for this same
[55:05] Jesus shall return Amen in a physical
[55:08] bodily return and we'll meet him in the
[55:11] air I believe
[55:14] that and brother says the church is a
[55:18] holy ghost filled
[55:20] church I believe that I believe if
[55:24] you're not filled with the Holy Ghost
[55:25] you'll split hell wide open I believe
[55:28] you'll miss a Rapture you'll go into
[55:30] Great Tribulation and I don't know what
[55:32] to tell you after that but I can tell
[55:35] you on this side you need the Holy Ghost
[55:37] I believe that the Church of the Living
[55:39] God is a holy ghost filled church
[55:43] amen with the power of God dwelling in
[55:47] her oh
[55:49] my I know you was waiting on this quote
[55:53] but brother and this is all in one one

[55:57] believe I believe the church is a holy
[55:59] ghost filled church that
[56:01] preaches Holiness to the very
[56:04] extremes don't you think
[56:07] so amen I believe in Holiness to the
[56:10] extremes I believe that that that that
[56:13] men Walk and Walk Right talk right and

[56:26] they wear a holy ghost uniform
[56:29] Hallelujah they live amen A Life That's
[56:32] worthy of the Gospel I believe preachers
[56:34] have to meet the qualifications amen
[56:36] that's laid down in the scriptures I
[56:39] believe that deacons have to live a life
[56:41] that's worthy of the
[56:43] Gospel Hallelujah we believe in Holiness
[56:47] to the
[56:49] extremes and we're not talking about
[56:51] dishrag
[56:52] Holiness huh we're not talking about you
[56:55] know wish bone Holiness but real
[57:00] Holiness
[57:02] amen I like
[57:04] this this is from faith that was once
[57:06] delivered to the Saints brother Bram
[57:08] says we believe in the
[57:11] phenomenal Hallelujah I believe in
[57:14] phenomenal Christians well you say what
[57:17] does phenomenal really mean well a
[57:19] phenomenal according to the uh uh the I
[57:23] think it's called a thesaurus
[57:26] it the the phenomenal applies to what is
[57:29] known or perceived through the
[57:32] senses rather than by Intuition or R
[57:37] rational
[57:38] deduction there's a lot of people that
[57:41] can
[57:42] rationalize or uh uh uh by intuition uh
[57:47] think about things uh of the church but
[57:50] I'm here to tell you this evening that
[57:52] this gospel it works in every way every
[57:56] part of it works brother man says it has
[57:58] the same Sensations it has the same
[58:01] experiences it has the same Supernatural
[58:04] if it doesn't it's a seed of
[58:08] discrepancy so now then I believe in a
[58:10] phenomenal gospel I believe in a gospel
[58:13] that works it ties what we used to say
[58:16] Amen in the old farming Community it's
[58:18] tying every bundle that old Baylor just
[58:21] kicking them out one right after the
[58:23] it's not it's hitting on all 18 Cinders
[58:26] amen it's working perfectly everything
[58:29] in conjunction Holiness is working with

[1:00:18] been there amen and got the
[1:00:20] T-shirt Hallelujah I know what it's like
[1:00:24] to roll out of bed in my own vomit amen
[1:00:27] I know what it's like to wet my own bed
[1:00:29] as a grown man I know what it's like to
[1:00:31] crawl around in a gutter and wonder
[1:00:33] where my next meal is going to come from
[1:00:36] but I also know the power of the Living
[1:00:38] God who's able to take that desire 100%
[1:00:42] away from me Hallelujah to deliver me
[1:00:46] from sin and sex and filth and
[1:00:49] perversion and take it out of my heart
[1:00:52] to Amen to never look back amen
[1:00:56] been there I know that it's a gospel
[1:00:58] that
[1:00:59] works
[1:01:05] amen believe in people's Liberty to say
[1:01:09] amen and praise the
[1:01:11] Lord hallelujah oh you get into some
[1:01:14] Churches and you wonder you know you
[1:01:17] wonder if they even believe the things
[1:01:18] that you're
[1:01:19] preaching they just sit there and stare
[1:01:22] at you like a mule looking at a new gate
[1:01:25] they just they they they don't even know
[1:01:28] and and and the ears going forward
[1:01:30] brother Braham said h h h wondering well
[1:01:34] it just shows where your daddy
[1:01:36] is hallelujah oh but when somebody can
[1:01:39] hear the word of God and something stirs
[1:01:42] up in their soul and they can wave their
[1:01:44] hand and tears run off their face
[1:01:46] unbidden amen and say I know that that's
[1:01:48] the truth and I believe it amen a little
[1:01:51] woman named hadie wght one time said
[1:01:53] brother brandom that ain't nothing but
[1:01:55] the truth amen and her two boys fell
[1:01:57] over her lap and wept their way to God I
[1:02:00] believe in that kind of
[1:02:05] religion goes on to
[1:02:08] say I believe we believe in the people's
[1:02:12] Liberty to say Amen praise the Lord and
[1:02:15] whatever the spirit of God leads you to
[1:02:17] do do it am and he won't lead you to do
[1:02:22] anything but what's
[1:02:24] right he goes on to say now the church
[1:02:27] believes in the baptism of water in the
[1:02:30] name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the
[1:02:33] remission of sins after repentance amen
[1:02:37] so he clarified something here because a
[1:02:39] lot of people think that they get saved
[1:02:41] in water or just because they got
[1:02:43] baptized that that means that they're
[1:02:44] saved or that their sins have been
[1:02:46] remitted no their sins are remitted when
[1:02:48] they repent their sins are remitted when
[1:02:51] they turn from sin when they when they
[1:02:53] when they when they weep their way to
[1:02:55] God God and and are justified by faith
[1:02:58] and then you can go to the water and the
[1:03:00] promise of the Holy Ghost is there for
[1:03:02] you amen it goes on to say it believes
[1:03:06] talking about the church it believes in
[1:03:07] the baptism of the holy spirit with the
[1:03:11] fruits of the spirit following yes amen
[1:03:15] the fruits of the spirit longsuffering
[1:03:18] gentleness
[1:03:20] patience these are
[1:03:22] attributes but remember the fruit is in
[1:03:24] the root yeah whatever was in that
[1:03:27] original seed's got to come out if you
[1:03:30] got something coming out that's contrary
[1:03:31] to these things and I wonder what the
[1:03:33] seed was you may need to come back to
[1:03:37] the
[1:03:40] seed patience good goodness
[1:03:44] meekness we believe in nine spiritual
[1:03:47] gifts oh amen you mean tongues and
[1:03:50] interpretation ain't
[1:03:52] everything you know hey we would love to
[1:03:55] have it but you know according to the
[1:03:58] scriptures we find that tongues and
[1:04:00] interpretation of tongues was under
[1:04:03] judgment well the church the bride isn't
[1:04:05] under judgment we've received our
[1:04:08] message for this day we've heard of
[1:04:10] legible intelligible voice now not to
[1:04:13] put away the tongues and interpretation
[1:04:15] because it brother ra tells us that they
[1:04:17] keep the church clean but what about the
[1:04:19] other seven that's what I want to ask
[1:04:21] questions about because we got seven
[1:04:23] more that are still functioning and need
[1:04:26] to be uh operated in every uh in in
[1:04:30] every local assembly he said nine
[1:04:32] spiritual gifts all nine of
[1:04:35] them wisdom and knowledge then he goes
[1:04:38] into the five Ministry gifts teachers
[1:04:40] Apostles prophets Gifts of tongues
[1:04:43] interpretation of tongues Divine Healing
[1:04:45] those
[1:04:46] things we believe amen so this is a
[1:04:50] message or a gospel that works it's got
[1:04:53] all the all the mechanical parts are in
[1:04:57] in in order they're connected the Bible
[1:05:00] tells us that every joint supplying amen
[1:05:03] all right so then he comes down and I
[1:05:06] and I'm not going to spend a but this
[1:05:09] applies across the board because in
[1:05:12] verses two and three he talks about aged
[1:05:14] men and aged women then it goes on down
[1:05:16] talks about young women and then young
[1:05:18] men so we don't want to spend all of
[1:05:21] chapter 2 talking about these things but
[1:05:24] we want to call your attention to this
[1:05:26] one thing that when he when he gives the
[1:05:31] the the the description of what the age
[1:05:36] men what you're going to teach the age
[1:05:38] men he does basically the same thing to
[1:05:40] the age women and to the young women and
[1:05:42] to the uh because the he he he just kind
[1:05:45] of repeats these things but maybe
[1:05:48] changes the order a little bit so for
[1:05:50] the sake of
[1:05:51] time we're just going to uh uh give you
[1:05:54] a few descriptions i s
[1:05:57] here verse two says that you're going to
[1:06:01] so chapter one he talks about the
[1:06:02] ministers chapter two you're going to
[1:06:04] preach sound Doctrine which uh uh uh
[1:06:08] speak thou things which become sound
[1:06:10] Doctrine verse two that the Aged
[1:06:14] men uh be sober
[1:06:18] grave uh temperate sound in speech in
[1:06:24] charity and patient okay then he goes to
[1:06:27] the aged women likewise so everything
[1:06:29] that applies to the Aged men applies to
[1:06:32] the aged women in their uh uh in their
[1:06:36] gender so just want to throw this out
[1:06:39] here for
[1:06:39] you the word aged men there and aged
[1:06:44] women it speaks of maturity that's what
[1:06:48] it speaks of it speaks of an elder it
[1:06:52] literally means an ambassador
[1:06:56] so here so these aged men are
[1:07:00] ambassadors in other words they are the
[1:07:03] signature representative an ambassador
[1:07:06] is a signature representative of a
[1:07:09] nation and I put this myself what the
[1:07:12] message is to
[1:07:14] produce so so any man that is uh of
[1:07:19] marrying age or a father or a
[1:07:22] grandfather any woman that is of
[1:07:24] marrying age that that could be a mother
[1:07:26] or that is a mother or a grandmother
[1:07:29] this applies so the greater part of the
[1:07:32] congregation that you are
[1:07:34] ambassadors you are you are Titus all
[1:07:38] right you are a
[1:07:40] Christian you are what the message is
[1:07:42] supposed to
[1:07:43] produce that when at the end of the day
[1:07:46] when when when the poster child for uh
[1:07:51] uh uh for the message of the hour is to
[1:07:54] be the that that that that picture is to
[1:07:56] be taken you could stand there and the
[1:08:00] reason for that is is because there's
[1:08:03] younger that need a living example amen
[1:08:07] and so here you are the Aged men the
[1:08:09] aged women the the mature adults in the
[1:08:13] church that you're to be sober now the
[1:08:16] word sober there is the word nefos now
[1:08:21] this is really uh it's real deep like
[1:08:25] you know uh this is probably going to
[1:08:27] blow your mind but the word sober means
[1:08:30] not
[1:08:35] intoxicated that's
[1:08:38] deep but it gets better it means free
[1:08:43] from negative
[1:08:46] influences it means clear
[1:08:50] minded it means
[1:08:54] circumspect and I like this last one it
[1:08:57] means free from LIF dominating
[1:09:01] influences and so so so likewise women
[1:09:06] likewise young men likewise young women
[1:09:10] soberness you go and read the scripture
[1:09:12] it'll tell you likewise and it'll give
[1:09:14] you the list and soberness falls under
[1:09:17] every demographic and so we realize then
[1:09:19] that that that qualifies each and every
[1:09:22] one of us that this soberness will well
[1:09:25] of course we're not we're going to be
[1:09:26] free from intoxicants we're going to be
[1:09:29] free from those things but what about
[1:09:31] free from Life dominating
[1:09:34] influences what about circumspect what
[1:09:38] this is this is what all of us have to
[1:09:40] come to we need to look around you
[1:09:42] friends and we need to see the bigger
[1:09:44] picture that it's not all about me it's
[1:09:46] not all about number one but this is
[1:09:49] this is somebody that we have to be
[1:09:51] concerned about everyone when a drunk
[1:09:54] gets drunk he's only thinking about one
[1:09:56] person and that's himself now he loves
[1:09:59] everybody but he's really only thinking
[1:10:01] about himself cuz he'll tell you that he
[1:10:03] loves you if he gets drunk
[1:10:06] enough they love
[1:10:08] everybody but they really only love
[1:10:10] themselves they only they're only trying
[1:10:12] to exit their their their present and
[1:10:15] the now oh my what is it it's just a
[1:10:19] life of selfishness but what about the
[1:10:22] free from Life dominating influence
[1:10:25] you know I and we have to come back and
[1:10:28] and I know every preacher Under the Sun
[1:10:30] has preached on social media and
[1:10:31] Facebook and all these kind of things
[1:10:33] but it's it's the modern it's the
[1:10:35] reality of
[1:10:36] today that how much of the the the the
[1:10:41] gaming and the and the videos and the
[1:10:44] and the Facebook and the shorts and The
[1:10:47] Tick Tock and all these things it
[1:10:49] consumes our life it's not sin to look
[1:10:51] at those things if you're looking at it
[1:10:53] through the thinking man's filter and
[1:10:54] that's that's that I we all you know get
[1:10:58] a kick out of some of those things but
[1:11:00] what about when it life
[1:11:02] dominates what about when it consumes
[1:11:05] you when you can't even sit down at a
[1:11:06] decent meal with a group of people and
[1:11:09] keep your face out of your
[1:11:11] Facebook what about what about when you
[1:11:14] can't even have a when your wife is
[1:11:16] really really needing to talk to you and
[1:11:18] you and you got your buds in and you
[1:11:20] can't hear a thing she's saying and
[1:11:21] she's trying to spill her guts oh my
[1:11:24] what what what about the man that'll
[1:11:26] stand up pay attention listen to the
[1:11:29] needs of his children and look at the
[1:11:31] LIF dominating things that are over
[1:11:34] swelling into his house cuz remember you
[1:11:37] are the moon you're the one that
[1:11:40] controls the tide of what's coming into
[1:11:42] your house and you've got to point your
[1:11:44] finger and say get
[1:11:46] back
[1:11:48] amen
[1:11:50] am tells us here that this this this
[1:11:58] Christian is to be
[1:12:00] grave not like six feet under
[1:12:05] grave but that word grave there means
[1:12:09] dignified the Bible tells you to be
[1:12:12] dignified dignity that means do things
[1:12:15] that are honest that are that are uh
[1:12:18] that are
[1:12:20] honorable that that you you that you
[1:12:22] won't say something because it says
[1:12:24] sound in
[1:12:26] speech brother sister young people yeah
[1:12:31] you got one mouth and two
[1:12:34] ears that means you listen twice as much
[1:12:37] as you
[1:12:39] talk because people will say things
[1:12:42] don't say things you'll regret think
[1:12:45] about what you're going to say before
[1:12:46] you say it don't just blurt things out
[1:12:49] amen think about it sound in faith in
[1:12:52] charity in PE in patience
[1:12:57] I want to as we get ready to close
[1:13:01] here that they the speaking of the of
[1:13:04] the aged women but this applies to the
[1:13:05] Aged men as well that they be in
[1:13:08] Behavior as becometh
[1:13:11] Holiness not false accusers not giv to
[1:13:14] much wine teachers of good things now
[1:13:19] then that word good there it's another
[1:13:22] one of those deep words it means
[1:13:27] good are you with me Teach good things
[1:13:32] things that are noble things things that
[1:13:34] are holy things things that are of good
[1:13:37] report teach those things and that's to
[1:13:40] teach to the younger women why because
[1:13:42] that is the criteria that is the the
[1:13:46] curriculum that the Elder women have
[1:13:49] been given to teach the younger women to
[1:13:52] Elder men are given to teach the younger
[1:13:54] men hey follow me as I'm a follower of
[1:13:57] Christ put on the Lord Jesus Christ put
[1:14:01] on Holiness for without Holiness no man
[1:14:04] shall see the
[1:14:06] Lord so we we we realize then that there
[1:14:10] is uh the the uh uh
[1:14:15] two
[1:14:17] basic parts of teaching and anybody
[1:14:21] that's a teacher will agree with
[1:14:23] this you teach by two basic components
[1:14:27] number one by
[1:14:30] example remember this I've said it
[1:14:32] before you've heard it your children
[1:14:35] will never do what you
[1:14:38] say they will only do what you do so if
[1:14:42] you have an attitude your kids will have
[1:14:44] an attitude if you if you have a temper
[1:14:46] your kids will have a temper you know if
[1:14:49] you you know if you uh you know God
[1:14:52] forbid if you smoke don't tell your
[1:14:54] children not to cuz they will it doesn't
[1:14:58] matter I'm I'm guilty my kids not that I
[1:15:04] smoke but my mother did and my father
[1:15:06] did and my you know my my aunts and my
[1:15:08] uncles and they said don't you never
[1:15:10] pick this nasty habit up well what did I
[1:15:13] do pick the Habit up you know don't you
[1:15:16] never drink don't you never drive and
[1:15:18] drink and what did we do we drunk and
[1:15:20] drive you know or we got drunk and drove
[1:15:23] one of the two we did both and so what
[1:15:26] was it it was we we but the teaching of
[1:15:29] their lip service had nothing no effect
[1:15:33] on us only what they did you're so you
[1:15:36] teach by example there's a second part
[1:15:40] to that you teach by
[1:15:43] repetition you repeat the same thing
[1:15:45] over if you repeat the same behavior
[1:15:47] over and over and over in front of your
[1:15:48] children if you make the house of God
[1:15:51] every time the church doors open your
[1:15:52] children won't know any better they will
[1:15:55] be through those Church doors every time
[1:15:57] that whether they have the Holy Ghost or
[1:15:59] not why because you have instilled in
[1:16:01] them by repetition and by example that
[1:16:04] the house of God is where you're going
[1:16:05] to get help and without this the you're
[1:16:09] not going to get saved just because you
[1:16:11] come to church but because you come to
[1:16:13] church and you get under the presence of
[1:16:15] the word of God brother Jason's preached
[1:16:17] this for years amen the light goes forth
[1:16:19] it drives the darkness back and when it
[1:16:22] drives the darkness back the light can
[1:16:24] strike the
[1:16:26] seed
[1:16:31] Hallelujah as our musicians
[1:16:36] come I want to close with this little
[1:16:38] quote here from marriage and
[1:16:41] divorce brother B says and the
[1:16:44] bride we're talking
[1:16:46] about because all Christians are by
[1:16:53] feminine designation there're we're
[1:16:55] we're we're all under
[1:16:58] bride category we're all whether male or
[1:17:01] female is irrelevant we're under Church
[1:17:04] bride brother B says I'll no longer call
[1:17:06] you church I call you bride and so
[1:17:09] brother B talks about the bride here he
[1:17:11] says and the
[1:17:12] bride will be a lovely little lady of
[1:17:16] the
[1:17:17] word that's a
[1:17:19] Christian that's what Christian means a
[1:17:22] lovely little lady of the word
[1:17:27] unadulterated not
[1:17:29] touched by any man's
[1:17:32] organization any man-made
[1:17:35] Theory shall be
[1:17:37] purely
[1:17:39] unadulterated Bride of the
[1:17:42] word amen and amen
[1:17:46] amen friends we we've come a long ways
[1:17:51] through the years we
[1:17:57] had
[1:17:58] to Wade through Troubled Waters we've TR
[1:18:03] we had to Wade through church splits
[1:18:06] lost loved ones
[1:18:10] divorces backsliding leaving the message
[1:18:14] every kind of thing we we've waited
[1:18:16] through it and we're still standing amen
[1:18:19] we're going to make it I'm going to make
[1:18:22] it I'm not quitting I'm not giving up
[1:18:25] I'm not turning around amen no I'm going
[1:18:27] to I'm going to I'm going to keep
[1:18:29] pressing on that's that's the bride's
[1:18:32] Little Anthem I'll keep pressing on
[1:18:36] pressing on to higher
[1:18:40] ground but God's given us a formula he's
[1:18:43] given us a he's given us a an owner's
[1:18:49] manual think about it he's the owner and
[1:18:52] this is his manual and if you got
[1:18:55] something that's broke what do you do
[1:18:57] you go to the owner's manual you find
[1:18:59] out oh well this is what you got to do
[1:19:02] you got to sometimes you just got to
[1:19:04] reboot the thing you just got to go in
[1:19:07] and go back to default settings repent
[1:19:11] give your heart to the Lord quote the
[1:19:12] sinner's prayer go back to Romans 10 and
[1:19:16] agonize before God and get free from the
[1:19:19] thing that's bound you
[1:19:21] down it's just just a good simp simple

[1:23:38] God may may
[1:23:44] I is that your desire
[1:23:47] tonight be feasting on the word my I was
[1:23:50] just so enjoying that I
[1:23:53] [Music]
[1:23:55] tonight I was as I Was preparing getting
[1:23:58] ready for
[1:24:01] service you know I think that Paul talks
[1:24:04] about you know we die daily right right
[1:24:08] we die daily
[1:24:11] and you know I I think that is such an
[1:24:14] important aspect of being a Christian
[1:24:18] and I think about that a lot I think
[1:24:20] Lord your mercies are new every morning
[1:24:23] there's got to be a reason for that
[1:24:25] I always Avail myself of his new mercies
[1:24:29] every morning think about that brand new
[1:24:31] out of the box never been used never
[1:24:33] been used ready to go no adjustment
[1:24:36] needed God's full
[1:24:38] mercy and I I think like that because I
[1:24:41] want God
[1:24:42] moving unhindered in my life is that
[1:24:46] pretty simple and so you can imagine
[1:24:49] then I always think about that even
[1:24:51] extra when I'm coming to the house of
[1:24:53] God lord I want to come in here tonight
[1:24:55] I don't want anything to hinder I want
[1:24:58] to hear the word I want to feel the flow
[1:25:01] of the Holy Spirit I need church I need
[1:25:04] the fellowship I need I don't know about
[1:25:06] you but I need to hear the word of God I
[1:25:08] need to hear it preached I need to
[1:25:10] preach it
[1:25:12] myself and then of course you know
[1:25:16] inevitably that kind of prayer lead you
[1:25:19] to thinking sometimes and such was the
[1:25:22] case for me at church and I began to
[1:25:24] think think about just as a preaching
[1:25:26] from a preaching standpoint I said Lord
[1:25:28] what is it what's what's the greatest
[1:25:31] piece of advice what's the
[1:25:34] real you know that real thing that that
[1:25:37] can because we know that the Holy Ghost
[1:25:40] brother Bram said you might shout you
[1:25:43] might not you might run you might not
[1:25:46] you might dance you might not he said
[1:25:48] but one thing you will
[1:25:50] do that you will come subject to every
[1:25:53] word of
[1:25:55] God
[1:26:00] and of to have more control and more
[1:26:05] victory over this flesh am I like that I
[1:26:08] mean I'm happy for control but I'd like
[1:26:10] to have even more I'd like to be every
[1:26:13] day where the Holy Spirit can just flow
[1:26:15] through me every day no matter where I'm
[1:26:18] at I'm on the job I'm in the market I'm
[1:26:20] at home I'm in the car I I'm I'm talking
[1:26:23] to someone on the phone I want the Holy
[1:26:25] Spirit and I stood there talking to the
[1:26:28] Lord about that Lord I thought I said
[1:26:31] surely your word is
[1:26:34] sufficient it ought to be the Gospel of
[1:26:38] Jesus Christ and I thought that I left I
[1:26:41] left that conversation thinking Lord
[1:26:43] your word is enough and if it's not
[1:26:46] enough it ain't on you it's on me for
[1:26:48] not applying it and so when brother
[1:26:52] Dale and he starts talking about this
[1:26:54] this thing is it gets the job done amen
[1:26:58] it ACC it's it's it's uh it functions
[1:27:04] holistically I said Lord that is exactly
[1:27:08] what I needed to hear tonight the simple
[1:27:10] Gospel of Jesus Christ
[1:27:13] works it works if you'll apply it in
[1:27:17] your life you'll have Victory you don't
[1:27:19] need great tremendous we love we love to

[1:33:45] button
[1:33:52] here well we might not be using this one
[1:33:54] let see oh there we
[1:33:57] go okay I think it's
[1:34:08] on so uh I just wanted to share this um
[1:34:11] a few weeks ago uh I happened to be in
[1:34:15] bluon running some errands and I was in
[1:34:18] the um Ashley Furniture Store parking
[1:34:21] lot and you know if you're coming out of
[1:34:24] that parking lot and you're trying to go
[1:34:27] right it's very very difficult and um
[1:34:31] because the oncoming traffic and the
[1:34:33] traffic coming from off the exit ramp
[1:34:35] it's just it's very very hard and I
[1:34:38] hesitated going that way and I was like
[1:34:40] I don't know about this I probably
[1:34:41] should turn around and go the other
[1:34:42] direction I thought no it'll be okay
[1:34:43] I'll just take my time well I stopped
[1:34:47] and the people coming from the right um
[1:34:51] saw me trying to get out so they stopped
[1:34:53] their vehicle well it was a box truck
[1:34:57] and I couldn't see around the box truck
[1:34:59] to see the next Lane beside him and so I
[1:35:03] was inching out inching out inching out
[1:35:05] and I was trying to see and I noticed
[1:35:08] coming towards my left the lane was
[1:35:10] clear and I thought well I'll just inch
[1:35:12] out a little bit more and then I'll gun
[1:35:13] it and go and just about the time I did
[1:35:17] that a car came and he slammed on his
[1:35:21] brakes he literally put his arms out
[1:35:23] straight and I could tell he put
[1:35:25] everything into slamming on his brakes I
[1:35:27] could literally see the whites of his
[1:35:28] eyes he was so close to my car and I
[1:35:31] thought I'm going to be hit and at the
[1:35:33] same time I looked up to see if there
[1:35:35] was something else I could do and a semi
[1:35:37] TR was coming from the other side and I
[1:35:40] was like I don't know what to do I said
[1:35:42] Jesus help me and I somehow I whipped
[1:35:45] the car around and got into a to the
[1:35:47] turning lane going towards the right and
[1:35:50] I was able to zing on through there
[1:35:52] without the semi truck hitting me or the
[1:35:55] car hitting me and so I was telling Brad
[1:35:57] about that and he said what time was
[1:36:00] that and I told him and we figured out
[1:36:02] that it was about the same time he was
[1:36:04] on the other end of bluon and he said
[1:36:06] for some reason he said he was in his
[1:36:08] car and the Lord just struck his heart
[1:36:10] and he said Lord keep my wife safe today
[1:36:12] wherever she's at glory wow and so that
[1:36:15] was just a miracle because if that car
[1:36:18] had hit me it would have spun me over
[1:36:20] into the other lanes and that semit
[1:36:22] would have hit me and I wouldn't be
[1:36:23] standing here right now wow glory to God
[1:36:26] praise the
[1:36:31] Lord prise the
[1:36:34] Lord so last Sunday
[1:36:38] um I had an issue with my eye had been
[1:36:41] bothering me for two or three days I'd
[1:36:43] cut I think is what happened I think I'd
[1:36:46] got some stuff in my eye and it cut my
[1:36:48] eye like the cornea pretty bad and I've
[1:36:50] done that multiple times but this thing
[1:36:53] just would not quit it any light that
[1:36:56] hit it I'm sitting up here last Sunday
[1:36:59] those lights were killing me but it was
[1:37:01] just horrible I had sister Meredith look
[1:37:04] at it for me and she couldn't find
[1:37:06] anything in it or you know I even had
[1:37:09] Esther drive us to church which is a
[1:37:11] pretty big deal
[1:37:14] so but I went and got prayed for after
[1:37:17] service and I didn't it's not like
[1:37:19] anything just moved me to go do it or
[1:37:23] anything big but I just asked God I was
[1:37:25] like
[1:37:26] Lord I got to have my eyes to work yep
[1:37:29] and I can't even open my ey can't even
[1:37:31] drive right now cuz it's super painful
[1:37:34] but they laid hands on me and I opened
[1:37:37] my eyes during the prayer and I felt a
[1:37:41] pretty significant puff of wind go into
[1:37:44] my right eye and as soon as it did that
[1:37:47] it was absolutely zero pain right after
[1:37:50] that you can even go watch it on the
[1:37:53] archive I was I was holding my eye
[1:37:55] closed and right after that my eye was
[1:37:57] open and just totally fine but not only
[1:38:00] did I ask for that I to get healed I
[1:38:02] want perfect vision I wear contacts and
[1:38:05] glasses but I'm I'm going to get that
[1:38:07] perfect vision soon
[1:38:10] [Applause]
[1:38:15] so I wanted to give glory to the Lord on
[1:38:18] this um so we had Uriah at home and what
[1:38:23] that means is that I have to do all the
[1:38:25] paperwork for his birth certificate so
[1:38:28] which is a pretty extensive process it
[1:38:30] took me several hours and two doctors
[1:38:33] and had to get I had to go and get their
[1:38:36] uh their endorsement and it just took me
[1:38:38] a really long time and so I had
[1:38:40] everything prepared after a couple of
[1:38:42] weeks and I sent it out just priority
[1:38:45] mail and you know I was just kind of
[1:38:48] didn't think about it and a week goes by
[1:38:51] and I was like well I have a tracking on
[1:38:53] it so let me just go ahead and see where
[1:38:55] it is you know it's supposed to be there
[1:38:56] in one to three business days with
[1:38:58] priority mail and I checked it and it
[1:39:03] started in Hilton Head it got it went to
[1:39:05] Florida and then it went to Columbia
[1:39:07] which is where Department of Health is
[1:39:09] which is where it's supposed to be and
[1:39:11] then it went to Charleston and at this
[1:39:13] point at 7 Days Later it said that it
[1:39:15] was in route to the next facility so I
[1:39:18] was like okay well I'll just look again
[1:39:20] next week so the next week I looked it
[1:39:22] was uh Tuesday or Wednesday of the next
[1:39:24] week and it just still said the same
[1:39:26] thing just in route to the next facility
[1:39:29] and you know they say after seven eight
[1:39:32] business days you should probably call
[1:39:33] Cuz priority mail is usually pretty
[1:39:35] quick so I was kind of discouraged about
[1:39:37] it cuz it took me a long time and I
[1:39:39] didn't think to make I could have gotten
[1:39:41] everything done again but it just would
[1:39:43] have taken me a really long
[1:39:45] time brother J just pray to the Lord
[1:39:48] just ask him you know just he he cares
[1:39:50] about our lives he cares about the
[1:39:52] little things and so I I went home and I
[1:39:55] was just telling my wife and I was
[1:39:56] telling my mom just kind of discouraged
[1:39:58] I was like Mom will you just pray and uh
[1:40:00] Lord Lord answered her prayers so you
[1:40:02] know and I was like Mom will you pray
[1:40:05] and joy will you pray and let's just
[1:40:07] pray and so then we prayed about it I
[1:40:09] just put it in the Lord's hands and the
[1:40:11] next day um I went on and I called the
[1:40:16] person who it was supposed to to receive
[1:40:18] it and I was like hey did you get happen
[1:40:19] to get it I've been tracking it and they
[1:40:21] said no we haven't gotten it but I'll
[1:40:22] call you when when we do I said okay I
[1:40:25] went on and I tracked it and I made an
[1:40:26] inquiry so um just you know to see where
[1:40:30] it was this was almost almost at 2 weeks
[1:40:32] later and the next day I got a phone
[1:40:36] call from the lady at the Department of

[1:41:36] lord for keeping his hands on us through
[1:41:38] this uh hurricane it hit us at a
[1:41:41] category one and completely almost
[1:41:43] devastated Our Town everybody's been
[1:41:45] without power for most of the time they
[1:41:49] finally got power back to downtown so
[1:41:50] restaurants and stuff could open in the
[1:41:52] grocery store but we have a ton of Big
[1:41:55] Tall Pine trees and ones that did fall
[1:41:57] thank the Lord fell the opposite
[1:41:58] direction of the house there's only a
[1:42:00] few branches that hit the house so all
[1:42:01] of our our home and our cars everything
[1:42:03] was safe and then it's been really hard
[1:42:06] to find stuff I had to come all the way
[1:42:07] here just to get a generator um and they
[1:42:10] had just got a shipment in brother
[1:42:12] Luther was going to let me borrow his
[1:42:13] but ended up finding one able to buy it
[1:42:15] and um but then even just things like
[1:42:18] gas and ice and uh I didn't want to keep
[1:42:20] open the fridge and run the generator
[1:42:22] all the time so I just said something to
[1:42:23] the neighbor the other day cuz I saw he
[1:42:24] had something he well I went up to my
[1:42:26] lake house and uh that's where I got ice
[1:42:28] I was like okay but then he came back by
[1:42:30] that evening he had two big old buckets
[1:42:32] of ice he's the superintendent at the
[1:42:34] school and he's like well I went out to

[1:42:56] couple days ago I was riding my bike in
[1:42:59] the front yard um there was this car in
[1:43:03] this driveway it was backing up for some
[1:43:07] reason I
[1:43:09] stall and I couldn't turn I couldn't
[1:43:12] pull on the brakes but for some reason
[1:43:16] my arm grabbed on the brakes but I
[1:43:19] didn't mean
[1:43:21] to and I'm really thinking F that God
[1:43:24] saved my life and that I didn't get hit
[1:43:26] I'm glad
[1:43:32] I'm amen me too brother

[1:43:48] do which was resting
[1:43:51] and drinking water and salt and
[1:43:54] everything and it act it was actually
[1:43:55] getting
[1:43:57] worse so my motto in life is just keep
[1:44:00] pushing let God you know he'll heal you

[1:44:09] very much
[1:44:10] struggling and um I just went up for
