[0:00] let's uh stand and we'll have a word of
[0:02] prayer and read a scripture
[0:06] dear father ask that you would
[0:09] come down to this in our little service
[0:11] your father that you would take these
[0:13] few words that i have that's real simple
[0:16] simple little thought that you put on my
[0:17] heart and that maybe it wouldn't help
[0:18] the people father
[0:20] to fight the devil when they leave the
[0:22] church doors
[0:23] that they would
[0:24] be able to combat
[0:26] this wicked day a little bit more
[0:27] effectively
[0:29] and just these few simple words father
[0:31] you would be able to touch the needs of
[0:32] the people that have father we ask these
[0:34] things in the name of the lord jesus
[0:35] christ amen and while while we're
[0:37] standing we'll go ahead and read a
[0:39] scripture
[0:40] um turn to the book of matthew chapter
[0:43] 23
[0:45] and verse 23
[0:49] and uh wait for
[0:52] all right wait for y'all to turn
[0:59] and uh this is
[1:02] woe unto you scribes and pharisees
[1:04] hypocrites for you pay tithe of mint and
[1:07] anise and cumin and have omitted the
[1:10] weightier matters of the law judgment
[1:12] mercy and faith
[1:14] these ought you to have done and not
[1:16] leave the other undone
[1:18] you all can be seated
[1:21] um so
[1:23] i'd like to now take well first of all
[1:26] um the section my title for this morning
[1:29] is the weightier matters of the law um
[1:31] that's my title but maybe as a as sort
[1:33] of like a theme maybe like a topic kind
[1:35] of um just sort of the the
[1:38] the
[1:39] what i had in my mind um was this idea
[1:42] of carnality versus legalism
[1:44] there's always kind of the
[1:46] the
[1:47] the grand struggle of any christian i i
[1:49] particularly like the depiction of this
[1:51] in pilgrim's progress
[1:52] when pilgrim is uh or when christian is
[1:55] is
[1:56] crawling i believe was through the
[1:57] valley of shadow of death and on one
[1:58] side was legalism and the other side was
[2:00] was i forgot what they called it in the
[2:01] book but effectively legalism and
[2:03] carnality and one wrong step up to one
[2:05] side or one wrong sex with the other
[2:06] they both go down to the same pit
[2:09] um
[2:10] and
[2:12] but that's always kind of the the
[2:14] struggle of the christians to not go off
[2:15] one side of the other to always remain
[2:16] that keep that balance
[2:19] um but i would like to turn to um
[2:22] uh
[2:23] isaiah chapter one and we'll start at
[2:25] verse one
[2:26] um
[2:29] i apologize i already apologize to josh
[2:31] this morning
[2:32] i'm gonna be jumping all over on the
[2:33] scriptures so uh y'all don't have to
[2:36] turn i got it all
[2:37] on my tablet here so
[2:39] um
[2:40] uh well i'm sorry not verse one verse
[2:43] seven i apologize
[2:45] um ah there we go it says
[2:47] your country is desolate your cities are
[2:49] burned with fire your lands
[2:52] strangers devour it in your presence and
[2:54] it is desolate as overthrown by
[2:56] strangers
[2:57] and the daughter of zion is left as a
[3:00] cottage in a vineyard
[3:01] as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers
[3:04] as a besieged
[3:06] let's see here
[3:07] and the daughter of zion is left
[3:10] as a cottage in a vineyard
[3:12] as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers as a
[3:14] besieged city now
[3:16] personally i thought when i read this my
[3:19] wife was very thought it was ever so
[3:21] funny because i thought it was notable
[3:23] that god even thought that living on
[3:25] cucumbers was some sort of judgment um
[3:27] which
[3:28] i can't stand cucumbers which i thought
[3:30] really blessed my heart um
[3:33] so
[3:34] uh
[3:35] going on verse 9 except the lord of
[3:37] hosts had left unto us a very small
[3:39] remnant
[3:41] we should have been as sodom and we
[3:43] should have been like unto gomorrah
[3:49] and then it's
[3:50] verse 10 it says hear the words of the
[3:52] lord you rulers of sodom
[3:54] give ear unto the law of our god you
[3:57] people of gomorrah
[3:58] to what purpose is the multitude of your
[4:00] sacrifices unto me saith the lord
[4:03] i am full of the burnt offerings of rams
[4:06] and the fat of fed beasts and i delight
[4:08] not in the blood of bullocks or of lambs
[4:11] or of he goats
[4:13] when you come to appear before me
[4:15] who hath required this at your hand to
[4:18] tend my courts
[4:19] bring no more vain oblations
[4:22] incense is an abomination unto me and
[4:25] new moons and sabbaths
[4:26] the calling of assemblies i cannot away
[4:29] with it
[4:30] it is iniquity even the solemn meeting
[4:34] your new moons and your appointed feasts
[4:36] my soul hateth they are a trouble unto
[4:38] me i am weary to bear them
[4:41] and when you spread forth your hands i
[4:43] will hide mine eyes from you yea when
[4:46] you make many prayers i will not hear
[4:49] your hands are full of blood
[4:51] and so when i read this
[4:53] it so struck me
[4:56] because here's god even going down the
[4:58] line even the sabbath
[5:01] he was like don't why are you bothering
[5:04] like everything that you do that is
[5:06] supposed to be these are commandments
[5:07] that i told you to do i told you to
[5:09] uphold the sabbath i told you to have
[5:11] all these sacrifices i told you to do
[5:12] you know have holy convocations right
[5:15] that your solemn assemblies coming to
[5:16] church is pointless
[5:18] right this entire thing that you're
[5:20] doing is completely
[5:22] pointless because you have so
[5:25] backslidden your lives are so completely
[5:29] like contrary
[5:31] to everything that even when you try to
[5:33] do something holy and righteous it's
[5:35] it's a stink
[5:36] right it's just it's it's a it's a it's
[5:39] a pollution you know
[5:41] um and then i kind of want to jump down
[5:43] to
[5:44] malachi chapter one
[5:46] um
[5:48] and uh
[5:49] i'll
[5:50] wait for josh to
[5:52] to get it
[5:58] and we're gonna go verse one on this one
[6:00] for real this time
[6:04] actually
[6:04] no it's not it's chapter 8 for six
[6:11] okay
[6:12] i had all this stuff i was uh putting
[6:14] this together at about
[6:16] five o'clock this morning
[6:17] so uh i'm a little bit off on some of my
[6:20] remembering what all i put in what all i
[6:22] left out okay malachi chapter 1 verse 6
[6:25] a son on earth his father and a servant
[6:27] his master
[6:28] if then i be a father where is mine
[6:30] honor and if i be a master where is my
[6:32] fear saith the lord of hosts unto you o
[6:34] priests that despise my name and say
[6:37] where and have we despised thy name
[6:39] you offer polluted bread upon mine altar
[6:42] and you say where and have we polluted
[6:44] thee
[6:45] in that you say the table the lord is
[6:47] contemptible
[6:48] and if you offer the blind for sacrifice
[6:51] is it not evil and if you offer the lame
[6:54] and sick is it not evil offer it now
[6:57] unto thy governor will he be pleased
[6:58] with thee or accept thy person saith the
[7:01] lord of hosts
[7:02] so here again is god being like even so
[7:05] you're you're bringing me sacrifices
[7:07] they were supposed to bring you know
[7:08] obviously the best of the flock the best
[7:11] of what they could you know god demanded
[7:13] the best and then bring him sick
[7:14] crippled lame sacrifices
[7:17] you know when i read this initially i
[7:19] was like wow that is kind of like church
[7:21] people because you know
[7:23] it's
[7:24] i mean think about it why would they
[7:25] offer god a lame sacrifice because the
[7:28] nice ones had some value to them right
[7:30] you're not going to bring god the
[7:31] perfect lamb you could take that to the
[7:32] market and sell it for something no
[7:34] one's going to buy a crippled one right
[7:36] no one's going to want the blind and
[7:38] and diseased one
[7:39] right it's not worth anything so they're
[7:42] not they're they're they're bringing god
[7:44] the the off-cast and the remnants
[7:46] because it's it's too inconvenient to
[7:49] bring god anything more than that
[7:51] and so people i mean this is exactly
[7:53] what p what people are doing today when
[7:56] you know you you know you bring god some
[7:58] sort of half-hearted praise
[8:00] right or or the the the life that you're
[8:03] leading is kind of just mediocre or you
[8:06] know um uh even better when people will
[8:09] straight up skip church
[8:11] to go to work right i mean we can't
[8:13] bring god the good lamb that's got some
[8:14] market value that's worth some money in
[8:16] my pocket you know can't bring god you
[8:19] know a few hours on a wednesday night
[8:21] that's got some market value
[8:24] right
[8:25] so
[8:26] the
[8:28] and so this is this is kind of how i
[8:32] always read this um
[8:35] check my time here
[8:38] um
[8:39] and so this this is kind of i would say
[8:42] the carnality side of this right people
[8:44] not living up to just being
[8:46] [Music]
[8:47] uh maybe irreverent or um
[8:50] [Music]
[8:51] uh
[8:52] just having a a disregard for holiness
[8:55] just not caring being laxed being lazy
[8:58] and being
[9:01] uh just insincere
[9:03] and
[9:04] and just
[9:06] giving god the the bare minimum for what
[9:09] purpose i don't even know what why would
[9:11] you bother at that point you know almost
[9:13] be better off to just not god might
[9:15] respect you more um because at least
[9:17] then you're not you're being honest
[9:18] right you're you're
[9:20] because i mean if you bring god some
[9:21] lame sacrifice not only are you
[9:24] not being a christian you're also lying
[9:25] about being a christian
[9:27] right so don't do that
[9:29] um
[9:31] so
[9:33] i want to jump down to
[9:34] matthew
[9:36] chapter 23
[9:44] and we'll um
[9:46] this one for actually for real is verse
[9:49] one
[9:51] yeah
[9:52] then spigel uh spake jesus to the
[9:55] multitude and to his disciples saying
[9:58] the scribes and the pharisees sit in
[10:00] moses seat
[10:03] all therefore whatsoever they bid you
[10:05] observe that observe and do
[10:08] but do not ye after their works for they
[10:12] say and do not
[10:14] for they bind heavy burdens
[10:16] and grievous to be born and lay them on
[10:19] men's shoulders
[10:21] but they themselves will not move them
[10:23] with one of their fingers
[10:26] right
[10:26] so you get
[10:29] this is this is the other side of this
[10:30] right you get people who
[10:33] will happily
[10:34] you know berate people
[10:37] about
[10:38] any flaw or failing that they see in
[10:40] their life you know always looking down
[10:42] their nose at people always being you
[10:43] know when some struggling teenager comes
[10:46] into the church
[10:47] and then uh
[10:49] my child would never act like that like
[10:51] oh really
[10:53] right like most of the time they
[10:54] actually are just they're smart enough
[10:55] to do it when you're not looking um
[10:58] the
[10:59] you know it's it's
[11:03] the
[11:05] it's this this this constant
[11:08] um uh it's it's a what it really speaks
[11:10] to is it's a love of self because you're
[11:12] looking at what i can do
[11:14] right what what me and i can do
[11:17] and um
[11:21] and i if i want to skip down to verse 13
[11:23] here it says but woe unto you scribes
[11:25] and pharisees hypocrites for you shut up
[11:28] the kingdom of heaven against men for
[11:30] you neither go in yourselves
[11:32] neither suffer ye them that are entering
[11:34] to go in
[11:35] woe unto you scribes and pharisees
[11:37] hypocrites for you devour widows houses
[11:40] and for a pretense may make long prayer
[11:43] therefore you shall receive the greater
[11:45] damnation
[11:46] woe unto you scribes and pharisees
[11:48] hypocrites for you can pass sea and land
[11:51] to make one proselyte and when he is
[11:53] made you make him twofold more the child
[11:55] of hell than yourselves
[11:58] that's pretty harsh you know you know as
[12:01] much as as much as people want to
[12:02] complain about brother branham being
[12:03] harsh on a lot of the denominational
[12:05] world
[12:06] i mean
[12:08] it's not much any harsher than what
[12:09] brother brother jesus himself had to say
[12:12] right
[12:13] you know jump down to uh verse 23 for me
[12:17] is where we read uh for our text
[12:20] um
[12:21] woe unto you scribes and pharisees
[12:22] hypocrites for you pay tithe of mint and
[12:25] anise and cumin and have omitted the
[12:27] weightier matters of the law judgment
[12:29] mercy and faith these you ought to have
[12:31] done and not leave the other undone
[12:34] so
[12:36] here's jesus pointing out that the
[12:39] weightier matters of the law beyond
[12:41] paying your tithes
[12:43] is judgment mercy and faith
[12:46] right
[12:47] like he's and notice he said do do the
[12:49] things that they're saying to do don't
[12:51] don't be
[12:53] you know acting like what they're
[12:54] telling you to do isn't important it is
[12:57] right having
[12:58] you know
[12:59] having the church order side of things
[13:01] is important we need those things
[13:03] because otherwise you become
[13:04] disrespectful
[13:06] but if you're doing it at the cost and
[13:08] completely neglecting
[13:11] the
[13:12] the the judgment mercy and faith well
[13:14] that's the more important stuff you know
[13:16] it says in verse 24 you blind guys with
[13:18] strain a gnat and swallow a camel
[13:21] woe into you scribes and pharisees
[13:23] hypocrites for you make clean the
[13:25] outside of the cup end of the platter
[13:27] but within they are full of extortion
[13:29] and excess right legality is so much
[13:32] harder to deal with because it's on the
[13:34] outside where no where no one can see
[13:36] that there's a problem but on the inside
[13:37] it's full of extortion and excess
[13:40] right
[13:42] thou blind pharisee cleanse first that
[13:44] which is within the cup and platter
[13:46] that the outside of them may be clean
[13:49] also
[13:51] um
[13:52] and uh
[13:53] we can
[13:55] want to
[13:56] and so this is this is jesus kind of
[13:57] showing
[13:59] like we've already said you know there's
[14:01] this there's a
[14:03] if you go down the road of of legalism
[14:06] you're going to end up in almost a worse
[14:08] spot than in carnality because
[14:11] i think this is
[14:13] you know for me that
[14:14] i've always felt this way and i you know
[14:16] brother brandon even talks about how
[14:17] there ain't no devil like a religious
[14:19] devil
[14:20] um
[14:21] the problem with the with a legalistic
[14:24] spirit
[14:25] is that
[14:27] it's almost impossible to get rid of
[14:29] right it really takes the power of god
[14:31] to do it because
[14:34] the sinner has no idea he's a sinner and
[14:37] you hardly can't convince him that he is
[14:39] right what are you gonna do right you
[14:42] try to convince him that he's got a
[14:43] problem he's like oh yeah but like i am
[14:45] so detailed and meticulous and in my
[14:46] conducting of my affairs i pay tithes on
[14:48] these tiny little spices
[14:50] right these insignificant little things
[14:52] i'm even
[14:53] dotting all my eyes and crossing my t's
[14:55] how can you say that i'm a sinner
[14:57] it's like well
[15:00] um
[15:01] let's so i'm gonna
[15:04] jump back up to isaiah
[15:07] chapter one
[15:11] and this time we're going to go to verse
[15:12] 16.
[15:17] and so where we left off reading this is
[15:20] when god is basically saying you know i
[15:21] don't
[15:22] no more incense no more sabbath none of
[15:24] that this is all pointless stop it
[15:26] you're just polluting my throne room
[15:28] with this foul stink
[15:30] right
[15:30] um
[15:32] and so
[15:33] he says in verse 15 and then you spread
[15:35] forth your hands i will hide my eyes
[15:36] from you yea you make many prayers i
[15:38] will not hear your hands are full of
[15:40] blood
[15:41] verse 16
[15:43] wash you make you clean put away the
[15:46] evil doings from before mine eyes cease
[15:49] to do evil
[15:50] learn to do well seek judgment
[15:53] relieve the oppressed judge the
[15:56] fatherless plead for the widow
[15:58] come now let us reason together saith
[16:00] the lord though your sins be a scarlet
[16:02] they shall all be white as snow though
[16:04] they be red like crimson they shall be
[16:06] as wool if you be willing and obedient
[16:10] ye shall eat the good of the land but if
[16:12] you refuse and rebel you shall be
[16:14] devoured with the sword for the mouth of
[16:16] the lord hath spoken it
[16:18] and so here's
[16:20] i find this interesting
[16:22] that here's god just absolutely
[16:26] rejecting all of their their worship
[16:28] services and their church and their
[16:30] sacrifices and their incense and all
[16:33] these things that they were doing
[16:35] and at the core of it the the thing that
[16:38] they were doing was failing
[16:42] to
[16:43] do well they were failing to seek
[16:45] judgment they were failing to relieve
[16:47] the oppressed and they were failing to
[16:49] judge the fatherless
[16:51] right
[16:52] that this is
[16:53] it wasn't even so much it doesn't
[16:54] mention in this that they were even
[16:56] bringing polluted sacrifice
[16:58] right like in in malachi that's what the
[17:00] problem was that's what god said
[17:03] but in this
[17:04] they were basically failing to
[17:08] relieve the oppressed be good to the
[17:10] people around you
[17:11] right
[17:12] be judge the fatherless be
[17:15] when when there when there are people
[17:16] who who don't have anybody else and the
[17:19] widows and the orphans amongst you the
[17:21] the people in need in your own church
[17:23] you turn your nose up and walk away and
[17:25] won't even lift a finger to help anybody
[17:28] right
[17:29] how how
[17:31] this is
[17:32] you the sacrifice means nothing because
[17:34] you're you're failing to um
[17:38] you're failing to uphold the goal that
[17:40] the sacrifice was trying to get you to
[17:41] in the first place
[17:43] right
[17:44] the the you know if um
[17:50] i guess you know
[17:52] in
[17:53] in uh malachi when it says
[17:55] talking about the sacrifices the lame
[17:57] sacrifices right and how they're
[17:59] bringing polluted sacrifices
[18:01] when i read this i immediately think in
[18:03] my mind
[18:04] of um
[18:06] uh
[18:07] let me pull it up here of hebrews um
[18:11] hebrews 13
[18:12] or hebrews chapter 13 verse 15
[18:15] says by him therefore let us offer the
[18:18] sacrifice of praise to god continually
[18:22] that is the fruit of our lips giving
[18:24] thanks to his name
[18:28] but
[18:29] but so so this is this is paul saying by
[18:32] him therefore let us offer the sacrifice
[18:34] of praise to god continually that is the
[18:36] fruit of our lips giving thanks to his
[18:37] name right so we you know we think okay
[18:40] we're going to come into the into the
[18:41] worship service and we're going to
[18:42] praise and we're going to really
[18:43] sacrifice you know when it's on a
[18:44] wednesday night and you're tired and
[18:45] you're miserable and nobody wants to
[18:47] nobody wants to you know clap their
[18:49] hands and have any kind of energy but
[18:52] you're giving forth all that you got
[18:53] even if you're completely dog tired and
[18:54] all you can manage is to barely raise
[18:56] your hand and oh you give all you got
[18:58] but it's all you got right you're giving
[18:59] your widows might because all you've got
[19:01] is is you've worked hard all day right
[19:03] but you're gonna do the best you can
[19:04] even if it's miserable
[19:07] that's
[19:09] that's that's the that's the sacrifice
[19:11] of praise right
[19:14] and that's wonderful and you should do
[19:15] that however but
[19:17] to do good and to communicate forget not
[19:21] for with such sacrifice god is well
[19:24] pleased
[19:26] right
[19:27] obey them that have the rule over you
[19:29] and submit yourselves for they watch for
[19:32] your souls as they that must give
[19:34] account that they may do it with joy and
[19:37] not with grief for that is unprofitable
[19:39] for you
[19:41] and then um
[19:43] we look at romans chapter 12 and verse 1
[19:46] i beseech you therefore brethren by the
[19:48] mercy by the mercies of god that you
[19:51] present your bodies a living sacrifice
[19:54] holy acceptable unto god which is your
[19:56] reasonable service
[19:59] and be not conformed to this world but
[20:01] be transformed by the renewing of your
[20:03] mind
[20:04] that you may prove what is that good and
[20:07] acceptable and perfect will of god for i
[20:09] say
[20:11] through the grace given to me to every
[20:13] man that is among you
[20:15] not to think of himself more highly than
[20:17] he ought to think
[20:18] but to think soberly according as god
[20:21] hath dealt to every man the measure of
[20:22] faith
[20:24] so here's if you're going to present
[20:25] your body as a living sacrifice it's you
[20:27] know it is part of it is coming in and
[20:29] and sacrificing or giving offerings you
[20:31] know when they pass the plate and things
[20:32] like that
[20:33] those are the sacrifice and those are
[20:35] truly are sacrifices however the harder
[20:37] sacrifice and the sacrifice that god is
[20:39] is well pleased in
[20:42] is sacrificing your pride
[20:44] you know putting that thing on the altar
[20:46] because that that's the tough one
[20:48] right because you know
[20:50] when you when you
[20:52] when you sacrifice in that worship
[20:54] service or you put that money in the
[20:55] plate that's a temporary thing right you
[20:57] can get more money
[20:59] you know the worship service is only 30
[21:01] minutes long right that's over
[21:03] soon it's quick but
[21:06] sacrificing your pride is the thing you
[21:07] do for the rest of your life
[21:09] right that doesn't stop
[21:11] you know
[21:13] and verse 9 it says love
[21:16] let love be without dissimulation abhor
[21:18] that which is evil cleave to that which
[21:20] is good be kindly affectionate to one
[21:22] another with brotherly love and honor
[21:25] preferring one another not slothful in
[21:28] business fervent in spirit serving the
[21:30] lord rejoicing in hope patient and
[21:32] tribulation continuing
[21:34] instant in prayer
[21:36] distributing to the necessary necessity
[21:38] of the saints given to hospitality bless
[21:40] them which persecute you
[21:42] bless and curse not rejoice with them
[21:44] that do rejoice and weep with them that
[21:47] weep be of the same mind one towards
[21:49] another
[21:50] mind not high things
[21:53] but condescends to men of low estate be
[21:55] not wise in your own conceit recompense
[21:58] no man evil for evil provide these
[22:01] provide things honest in the sight of
[22:02] all men if it be possible as much as
[22:05] life in you live peaceably with all men
[22:08] dearly beloved avenge not yourselves but
[22:11] rather give place unto wrath and if you
[22:14] that that
[22:16] phrase plays under the wrath it means
[22:17] give place to the wrath of god right not
[22:20] not your own wrath but god's wrath for
[22:22] it is written vengeance is mine i will
[22:24] repay saith the lord therefore if thine
[22:27] enemy hunger feed him if he thirsts give
[22:29] him drink for in so doing thou shall he
[22:32] calls a fire on his head be not overcome
[22:34] of evil but overcome evil with good and
[22:37] so this is this long thing of everything
[22:40] in there is a sacrifice to do
[22:43] it hurts sometimes your flesh doesn't
[22:45] like it it really is not comfortable to
[22:48] look somebody in the eye who just
[22:51] royally just wronged you in every way
[22:54] that you can think and to look in the
[22:56] eye and love them anyways and be nice to
[22:58] them and help them in their time of need
[23:01] right
[23:02] like you want to take someone i mean how
[23:04] many people
[23:05] how many stories can you sit there and
[23:07] think to yourself of people who
[23:10] straight up stole
[23:12] from their own family
[23:14] and then god is saying yeah those people
[23:17] you're supposed to put your arm around
[23:18] them and love them anyways and help them
[23:19] anyways even though you know they're
[23:21] stealing from you
[23:24] ouch
[23:26] that's hard that's a sacrifice
[23:28] that's why that's why god is saying
[23:31] that's the one that i am well pleased in
[23:34] right because that's the one you know
[23:37] you know it's not not to make light of
[23:39] of the sacrifices that we do a lot of
[23:41] the times those are important those are
[23:42] the small things that we got to do but
[23:44] sometimes there are things you know to
[23:46] bless them which persecute you oh that
[23:49] one really hurts
[23:51] um
[23:52] you know and and i mean but everything i
[23:54] mean you could spend a lot of time which
[23:56] i don't have on every one of these but
[23:58] just just to love people to to to net to
[24:02] be guard yourself against being a grouch
[24:05] you know when your day has been
[24:07] completely turned upside down and you're
[24:09] miserable and you know you're you're
[24:11] just really enjoying the little rain
[24:13] cloud that's over your head um
[24:16] you know and and you're i'm just gonna
[24:17] sit here and
[24:19] you know well
[24:21] don't
[24:22] don't do that it's a sacrifice
[24:25] it's a sacrifice to walk away from that
[24:27] you know and and and to and to love
[24:30] people even when it's you're feeling
[24:32] miserable
[24:34] that's the sacrifice that god is looking
[24:36] for that's the sacrifice of the
[24:37] christian life because ultimately that's
[24:39] what christ came to do right
[24:42] so just a few as i wrap it up here um
[24:45] just a few closing comments
[24:47] the reason
[24:49] legalism seems to be the worst issue is
[24:52] that the sinner is blinded to his sin by
[24:54] his own religious fig leaf covering
[24:56] right you get to hide behind your
[24:58] religion say i'm not a sinner i go to
[25:01] church
[25:02] wrong
[25:04] and secondly
[25:05] the entire point of the sacrifices
[25:08] altars ceremonies and holy convocations
[25:10] was to point to a god whose entire
[25:12] purpose was to love humanity who had
[25:14] rejected him
[25:16] right that was the whole point of all
[25:18] the things that they were trying to do
[25:20] the sacrifices all that was
[25:22] foreshadowing for a christ that would
[25:24] come
[25:24] and love people who didn't deserve it
[25:26] and to love the people who wronged him
[25:30] his purpose of being was to forgive the
[25:32] people who had tortured him to death
[25:35] church form without the love and
[25:37] kindness of god is nothing more than a
[25:39] 90 pound bag of wet salt
[25:42] so
[25:43] that is a little note for me there's a
[25:45] story of a in the
[25:47] in the
[25:48] concentration camps of germany there's
[25:50] one one in particular which the jews is
[25:52] a work camp slave labor work the poor
[25:55] jews to death camp
[25:57] and they would there was a as a cruel
[25:59] joke there was a big sign over the front
[26:00] door that said hard work will set you
[26:02] free
[26:03] because by that they meant hard work
[26:04] will kill you faster
[26:06] right
[26:07] and they
[26:08] on their first day when they stepped off
[26:10] the train they had a 90 pound bag of wet
[26:12] salt
[26:13] they had to pick up and carry to the
[26:15] other side of the camp and it's not like
[26:17] 30 yards it's like
[26:19] a mile
[26:20] right which is hard hard miserable work
[26:22] and a lot of them have shoes on their
[26:23] feet and they're walking through knee
[26:24] deep snow
[26:26] and it's miserable and they're about
[26:28] dead when they get there and then the
[26:30] guy at the other side of the camp says
[26:31] all right now go drag it back and put it
[26:33] back where you got it
[26:35] why
[26:36] because the whole point was because at
[26:38] least if you're growing crops or
[26:39] something it might be miserable slave
[26:41] labor and it's hard work but if you're
[26:42] growing crops you still have that tiny
[26:43] little consolation that the hard work
[26:45] that i'm putting in is producing
[26:46] something
[26:47] right there's a little life that's
[26:48] growing out of that
[26:50] but to make someone drag around a
[26:51] 90-pound bag of salt for nothing and
[26:53] literally put it back where they started
[26:56] is to say you're going to we're going to
[26:57] work you to death and there's not even
[26:59] going to be any life that comes out of
[27:00] it no growth whatsoever
[27:03] and that's what legalism does to people
[27:05] it shackles them to a burden that will
[27:07] work them to death and they will never
[27:09] see the first ounce of growth
[27:12] no spiritual growth whatsoever
[27:15] right and it is it is
[27:16] it is that is why
[27:20] no matter as much as it's almost we it's
[27:24] a temptation right if the bait didn't
[27:26] taste good
[27:27] it wouldn't be part of the trap
[27:29] right
[27:30] satan puts legalism out as a as bait
[27:32] because there's a something in our flesh
[27:34] that kind of likes it
[27:36] but at the end of the day all it is is a
[27:38] trap
[27:39] and so i i mean
[27:42] it is it is better even though it's hard
[27:44] to make that sacrifice to make that
[27:47] sacrifice and and
[27:48] you know when you see somebody doing
[27:50] something wrong to not be ready to stone
[27:53] them to death verbally
[27:55] you know
[27:56] um
[27:57] you got to kind of kill your pride and
[27:58] kill your flesh a lot and that that
[28:00] burns that's the sacrifice but i
[28:01] guarantee you it's a whole lot better
[28:03] than dragging a pound a spiritual burden
[28:05] that will kill you that'll work you to
[28:07] death dragging it around and will and
[28:08] you will have no growth
[28:12] and uh that's that's where we gotta quit
[28:14] so thank you all for listening we'll
[28:16] stand and have a word of prayer
[28:19] your father thank you for this
[28:20] opportunity to
[28:22] speak a little word to your your people
[28:24] father ask that you would take these
[28:25] words that i would have and
[28:27] stitch them together into something that
[28:28] would help the people father
[28:31] and that my
[28:33] kind of scattered brain thoughts would
[28:35] be able to be useful to them
[28:38] that your spirit would have gone forth
[28:39] and water the the seeds that i've
[28:41] planted father and we ask these things
[28:42] in the name of jesus christ amen
