[2:19] I've got some more that's on my heart
[2:22] and on my mind so we want to invite you

[2:29] foreign
[2:39] I wanted to make just um
[2:43] a quick announcement here let me see if
[2:45] I can get to it easily
[2:50] yes
[2:52] so um
[2:56] Sister Sarah Younce would like
[2:58] um wanted to say
[3:00] uh to my Bethel family I'd like to thank
[3:04] each and every one for the phone calls
[3:06] text messages food and flowers but most
[3:09] of all for your prayers we love and
[3:12] appreciate all the thoughtfulness may
[3:14] God richly bless you for all the
[3:16] kindness you have shown as I recover
[3:20] kindness is a beautiful thing you know
[3:22] that it's so absent from the world and
[3:25] and sometimes just a little love can go
[3:28] a long long way but love you know
[3:31] perfect love demonstrates itself it's
[3:35] it's um it's not passive it's active
[3:38] perfect faith is Pat is not passive it's
[3:42] active so it demonstrates itself and so
[3:47] we're happy our sister came through that
[3:49] good and I was on the road to recovery
[3:52] want to be remembering uh brother Larry
[3:55] and sister Sherry Jenkins also that
[3:56] entire family his mother passed away
[3:59] yesterday I got a chance to visit her
[4:02] last week before going out of town and
[4:06] what a grand lady and love the Lord with
[4:09] all of her heart and you know couldn't
[4:11] see quite to the level of this message
[4:14] but that's just in the hands of God
[4:15] nothing nothing all you can do is
[4:17] present it and live it but she certainly
[4:20] was a great Christian lady and I'll be
[4:23] accounted a great privilege to be
[4:24] speaking her funeral and we'll be
[4:26] sending you details on that
[4:28] um probably Tuesday or Wednesday I'm not
[4:30] sure brother Larry hasn't got the exact
[4:33] arrangements with me just yet but amen
[4:37] looking forward to that privilege Acts
[4:39] chapter 1
[4:45] let's begin reading at verse
[4:51] 4.
[4:57] and being assembled together with them
[5:00] commanded them that they should not
[5:02] depart from Jerusalem
[5:04] but wait for the promise of the Father
[5:06] which saith he ye have heard of me
[5:10] for John truly baptized with water but
[5:14] ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost
[5:17] not many days hence
[5:21] when they therefore were come together
[5:23] they asked of him saying Lord wilt thou
[5:26] at this time restore again the kingdom
[5:28] to Israel
[5:30] and he said unto them
[5:32] it is not for you to know the times or
[5:34] the seasons which the father hath put in
[5:37] his own power
[5:38] but ye shall receive power after that
[5:42] the Holy Ghost has come upon you and ye
[5:44] shall be Witnesses unto me both in
[5:46] Jerusalem and in all Judea and in
[5:50] Samaria and unto the uttermost part of
[5:53] the Earth
[5:54] and while they looked steadfastly toward
[5:57] Heaven as he went up behold two men
[6:02] stood by them in white apparel
[6:06] I'm sorry we skipped verse 9. and when
[6:09] he had spoken these things while they
[6:12] beheld he was taken up and a cloud
[6:15] received him out of their sight and
[6:18] while they looked steadfastly toward
[6:20] Heaven as he went up behold two men
[6:23] stood by them in white apparel which
[6:26] also said Yemen of Galilee why stand you
[6:30] gazing up into heaven this same Jesus
[6:33] which is taken up from you into heaven
[6:36] shall so come in like manner as you have
[6:40] seen him go into heaven may the Lord
[6:44] bless the reading of his word as we pray
[6:47] father we thank you for your love and
[6:50] your kindness to us thank you for your
[6:53] revealed word to us today Lord we are
[6:56] just so grateful for you that we are
[6:58] able to assemble here today on a bright
[7:01] and beautiful sunny day there's no
[7:03] Devastation to our Fair City our church
[7:06] and our family's Lord are all fine and
[7:09] Lord we pray for the Saints of anyone
[7:12] who suffered any kind of loss during the
[7:15] storm we have word from the churches in
[7:17] Florida that all the Believers are safe
[7:19] and the Lord was sparing his family as
[7:22] is to be expected you just do that so
[7:25] often Lord may we never make light of it
[7:28] may we always be very grateful may it
[7:31] humble us I pray now be with us in the
[7:34] word I pray be with my heart and my mind
[7:37] as you have led me down this path Lord I
[7:40] commit myself into your hands as always
[7:43] Lord to be an oracle of you I commit it
[7:46] to you in Jesus name amen God bless you
[7:49] friends you can be seated
[8:13] brother Branham
[8:16] spoke quite extensively
[8:19] on the ministry of the son of man
[8:22] I'm preaching to you today on parallels
[8:28] of the Third Exodus the Third Exodus of
[8:31] course is our home going amen the first
[8:35] Exodus was in Egypt when God brought a
[8:39] nation out of a Nation bringing Israel
[8:42] out that was The Exodus the second
[8:45] Exodus of course was when Christ Rose
[8:48] and carried uh men the the graves of
[8:51] many of the saints Saints which slept
[8:54] arose and were and went into the City
[8:58] and were seen and went back to heaven
[9:01] with him brother Branham even talks
[9:04] about Abraham and Sarah
[9:08] making a short Whistle Stop there in
[9:11] Jerusalem and uh don't know how that
[9:14] what that looked like but they he said
[9:16] Lord we haven't seen the old city in a
[9:18] long time can we make a quick Whistle
[9:20] Stop him and then after they
[9:22] turned down Glory Lane and went up
[9:25] Hallelujah Avenue a few times and and
[9:27] Abraham grabbed her and said oh Sarah
[9:29] we've been recognized we better go and
[9:31] vanished and so uh I tell you something
[9:34] friends
[9:35] um there's such a there's still such a
[9:38] shroud of mystery around what it's going
[9:40] to look like when the saints come back
[9:42] but we know they're coming back and we
[9:44] know that we'll be changed in a moment
[9:46] in the twinkling of an eye we know that
[9:48] one of these mornings brother Branham
[9:49] said that you'll feel a little funny
[9:52] feeling and uh in one place he called it
[9:54] a little twinge of almost like a pain he
[9:57] said it'll be the last pain you ever
[9:59] feel in your life oh man I am so looking
[10:04] forward to that amen when I I expect
[10:08] that you know I I I told when my
[10:11] preached brother Eddie's memorial
[10:13] service that um I said you know I'm
[10:16] looking for one of these mornings
[10:18] between six and nine to be you know if
[10:21] I'm not already up to be waking up and
[10:23] hear a familiar voice say Jason son get
[10:26] in here
[10:29] I'll shout all the way
[10:31] I'll jump out of the bed amen praise the
[10:34] Lord and uh oh my goodness my feet will
[10:38] go to dancing amen praise God so we're
[10:40] looking for that hour we don't know what
[10:43] all it will entail we know the bride
[10:45] will get together for brother Branham
[10:47] called it a month or so some people
[10:49] looked for the quote 30 to 40 days I've
[10:51] never been able to find it said that way
[10:53] but I find where he calls it a month or
[10:55] so and so will we have a Ministry well
[11:00] we'll certainly have a purpose I know
[11:01] that you know and one of the some of the
[11:04] purpose that we do understand is to get
[11:07] together before we meet him in the air
[11:10] because that's the order you say where
[11:12] do you get that from from the gospels
[11:14] that that that Jesus himself was seen
[11:17] and the Bible says that the Saints which
[11:19] roads were seen and so so we find that
[11:22] they were there for 40 days when Jesus
[11:25] ascended and and and then brother
[11:28] Brandon picks up the near narrative he
[11:30] led captivity captive and and they they
[11:33] went down and come to the gates and fell
[11:35] back on the scripture you know open up
[11:37] the Everlasting Gates and allow the Lord
[11:40] Of Glory to come in and a voice one of
[11:42] the Angels behind the gate who is the
[11:43] Lord Of Glory I need the password
[11:46] the Lord Mighty in battle the gates Rose
[11:49] and here brother I've said here went
[11:51] Jesus down the corridor down our I think
[11:53] uh you know Hallelujah Avenue and and
[11:55] all the way up to the father's throne
[11:57] and that great procession following him
[11:59] saying father they're yours my blood oh
[12:03] it has been offered and sacrificed and
[12:05] they're yours and so I look forward to
[12:08] that because you know we we we we long
[12:12] for that hour my and so we we know that
[12:16] there will be a time where at least
[12:17] we'll be getting together because you're
[12:19] not gonna when it comes time to see the
[12:21] Lord in the air remember that this is
[12:24] most most perfectly fulfilled on the day
[12:26] of Pentecost what we just read because
[12:28] Jesus feet doesn't come back down and
[12:30] touch the Earth till Revelation 19. so
[12:33] this is most properly fulfilled uh it's
[12:36] a dual meaning but it's most properly
[12:38] fulfilled on the day of Pentecost when
[12:41] he came down and they said just as you
[12:43] saw him go up he'll come down just like
[12:45] that he'll come down and he came down
[12:47] among them and divided himself into the
[12:49] church we'll say a little more about
[12:51] that as we go along but we find that
[12:54] that we're going to want to make sure
[12:56] that we've got all of our old
[12:59] acquaintances renewed and you know I
[13:01] want to see if this one made it or that
[13:02] one made it and my I want to see loved
[13:04] ones I haven't seen in years and because
[13:06] when it comes time to meet him in the
[13:08] air we want to have all eyes fixed all
[13:11] attention fixed oh I don't want to have
[13:13] any more questions at that moment I want
[13:16] to behold My Redeemer amen and even
[13:19] those in the sixth Dimension he's up
[13:22] higher they haven't seen him and so
[13:25] they're longing also so we find that
[13:28] brother Branham talks about the ministry
[13:31] of the son of man and it's extremely
[13:34] important to us because of it because of
[13:38] what it means and we realize and we've
[13:41] showed you before that there is a
[13:43] distinction to be made between the
[13:45] office of son of man and the ministry of
[13:48] Son of Man the office of son of man is a
[13:50] prophet and God uses a prophet because
[13:53] it's a prophet that brings you into the
[13:55] presence of God and gives you the Living
[13:57] Word a bleeding word without a prophet
[14:00] you have no access and that's why that's
[14:03] why whenever in every stage of
[14:05] redemption everywhere where God was
[14:07] showing Redemption from all the way to
[14:09] the Old Testament all the way to now he
[14:12] always used a prophet because the office
[14:15] and Ministry of a prophet is a Ministry
[14:18] of atonement and Jesus himself came as a
[14:21] son of man and so so we realize that
[14:24] we're looking for more than just his
[14:26] Blessing which you can get just by
[14:29] giving and God will cause men to give
[14:31] unto your bosom you can pay your tithes
[14:33] and offerings you don't even have to be
[14:34] a Christian and God will still bless
[14:36] that you can go to a Benny Hinn service
[14:39] and receive the true anointing of the
[14:42] Lord Jesus Christ it might be a an
[14:45] artificial false vessel but it's still a
[14:48] true anointing falling on a false vessel
[14:50] but when it comes to being taken into
[14:52] the presence of God you have to have
[14:55] blood you have to have a bleeding word
[14:56] and that's what a prophet comes to do to
[15:00] give you access as we've preached on
[15:02] that before Aaron could not go into the
[15:04] presence of the Shekinah without a lamb
[15:07] without blood without a sacrifice Moses
[15:10] went in and out and in and out and in
[15:13] and out of that Shekinah on Mount Sinai
[15:16] he walked in and out without any blood
[15:18] without any lamb he never sacrificed
[15:20] anything he because why he would that
[15:23] that office that he held that's what it
[15:25] was built for and when the Lord told him
[15:27] to go back down and make sure nothing
[15:29] touches the mountain if even an animal
[15:31] touches it's got to be killed and and
[15:33] when you come back bring Aaron with you
[15:35] and when he brings Aaron back into the
[15:38] presence of the Shekinah they never
[15:39] bring a lamb they never offer blood
[15:41] there's no sacrifice because Aaron is
[15:44] with Moses and he's under the umbrella
[15:46] of the son of man Ministry let us be
[15:49] glad and rejoice because God has sent
[15:51] that Ministry into the end time
[15:54] God has given you people say we don't
[15:57] need a prophet you certainly do if you
[15:59] didn't have a prophet why was Paul a
[16:01] prophet if you don't have a prophet you
[16:03] there's no way to establish Redemption
[16:06] see so that's why even during the the
[16:09] church ages they only got a dip of the
[16:13] Holy Ghost they didn't have the full
[16:14] token the abstract and the full title uh
[16:18] was in Paul's day and and the alpha and
[16:21] in the Omega and I'm determined not to
[16:23] get ahead of myself so let me just let
[16:25] me just keep keep going methodically
[16:27] along so we find that the minute that
[16:30] the office of son of man is Prophet but
[16:33] the ministry
[16:35] of son of man is a broader term it means
[16:38] the word made flesh so now at when when
[16:42] when Paul was taken home that didn't
[16:45] stop the ministry of Jesus Christ in the
[16:48] church
[16:49] see because that the word was still made
[16:51] flesh and when brother Brannan went home
[16:54] that didn't take away the pillar of fire
[16:57] that didn't take away the ministry of
[16:59] Christ Mrs Jesus was still here
[17:03] she's the final voice why because she's
[17:06] in the ministry of the son of man see so
[17:09] the testimony of Jesus Christ is the
[17:12] spirit of Prophecy
[17:14] all right so
[17:17] so we find that brother Branham would
[17:19] tie the word many times a lot of usage
[17:23] on this word incarnate or the
[17:27] Incarnation now Incarnation literally
[17:30] means embodied in flesh or taking on
[17:34] flesh it refers and I'm reading directly
[17:38] from the lexical Aid it refers to the
[17:41] conception and the embodiment of a deity
[17:44] or spirit in some Earthly form
[17:48] that's that's incarnate all right this
[17:52] is Incarnation or the appearance of a
[17:55] God as a human if capitalized it is the
[17:59] union of divinity ah it is the union of
[18:03] divinity with Humanity as an example
[18:06] Jesus Christ
[18:09] it is in its religious context the word
[18:12] is used to mean God deity or Divine
[18:17] being in human form on Earth
[18:23] so it's Christ in you the hope of glory
[18:28] so this is why a prophet had the
[18:30] bleeding word to deliver to you and I
[18:32] because we weren't merely looking for
[18:35] salvation from destruction the foolish
[18:38] virgin have that we were looking for
[18:41] Redemption which is a further work than
[18:44] than just salvation from destruction we
[18:48] were looking to be redeemed back to our
[18:50] original state what was our original
[18:52] state when morning Stars sang together
[18:55] and sons of God shouted for Joy I'm here
[18:58] to tell you something friends that's
[19:00] always been God's plan
[19:03] that's always how he's done it there's
[19:06] no reason to even think he would do it
[19:08] different just because it's the end time
[19:12] see
[19:13] so brother Branham now is going to pick
[19:15] this term up incarnate or Incarnation
[19:18] and I'm going to give you two quotes and
[19:20] I and they asked me for a PowerPoint I
[19:22] decided to skip it because I I don't
[19:25] want to get too slowed down this morning
[19:28] but just pay attention from the second
[19:30] seal now brother Branham is going to
[19:33] talk about the Beast because remember
[19:36] before the bride goes up and Satan is
[19:39] cast down
[19:40] now that's already in process and I
[19:43] can't preach on we're already ascending
[19:45] and he's already descending that's
[19:46] certainly true in the spiritual realm
[19:48] but but physically we're still here
[19:51] and but physically we're leaving here
[19:54] and in a very real form we're going
[19:56] there and in a very real form he's
[19:58] coming he's going to be thrown down here
[20:02] now you say well how has he already
[20:04] descending how is he already he has
[20:06] already fallen from his position to
[20:10] accuse you
[20:12] because you have now passed from Death
[20:14] To Life you've received the engrafted
[20:17] word you've become Mrs Jesus Christ and
[20:20] now because you are in the full uh grip
[20:22] of redemption then there is now
[20:25] therefore no condemnation to you it's
[20:28] not possible you cannot even be indicted
[20:32] God will not even hear a charge against
[20:34] you even if there's DNA evidence
[20:38] even if Satan brings forensic evidence
[20:41] and has you dead to rights God will not
[20:43] even hear the case because just like he
[20:47] imputed righteousness to Abraham and it
[20:50] had nothing to do with Abraham being
[20:53] good or better successful or a failure
[20:55] Abraham was a success many times also
[20:59] there were times when he failed
[21:02] he backslid and left the promised land
[21:04] brother Brandon said anytime a Jew
[21:06] leaves the promised land he's backslid
[21:08] and a famine came on and his
[21:11] perseverance got a little thin and he
[21:13] abandoned the promised land and went
[21:14] down to Egypt almost got himself killed
[21:17] almost lost his wife
[21:19] see picked up Hagar and of which
[21:22] Israel's still paying for that one
[21:26] they're still paying for that one
[21:29] and so so we we find that and then he
[21:32] did the same thing you know to the to
[21:34] the kingdom of the Philistines lying to
[21:36] save his skin so that when God imputed
[21:39] righteousness to Abraham it wasn't that
[21:43] God was saying I'm just going to turn a
[21:45] blind eye and I'm just going to say he
[21:46] lived a perfect record that had nothing
[21:48] to do with Abraham not his failures or
[21:51] successes he believed the word that made
[21:55] him part in the into the seed line of
[21:57] Christ and it's that faith and God
[22:00] attributed the righteousness of Christ
[22:03] that Christ would hadn't even come to
[22:06] live yet but when Jesus would come he
[22:09] would live a perfect life and before
[22:11] hundreds of years before he ever even
[22:13] showed up thousands of years before
[22:16] Jesus was on the scene Abraham was given
[22:19] full credit
[22:20] for the life the Son of God would live
[22:26] now that's before Calvary and before the
[22:28] Holy Ghost how much more
[22:31] are you and I Hallelujah
[22:40] so he's so now we find out that when the
[22:42] bride goes up and Satan comes down
[22:44] presently
[22:45] you have a false prophet the Pope
[22:49] he's a he's a false prophet because he's
[22:52] a preacher of false teaching
[22:55] and that makes him a false prophet
[22:57] see it's not a question
[22:59] there there's a distinction that has to
[23:01] be made between real prophets and true
[23:03] Prophets
[23:04] because Balaam was a real prophet
[23:07] but it wasn't a true prophet
[23:09] but he was a real one you understand but
[23:12] he wasn't a true one because he
[23:13] abandoned the word Moses was both a real
[23:16] one and a true one all right so so it's
[23:19] not just about being a prophet
[23:21] many false prophets shall arise and
[23:24] deceive many which means they shall have
[23:27] Global success
[23:29] which is kind of
[23:31] you know almost uh their success really
[23:34] is a is a Harbinger it's kind of an
[23:36] identification if they're successful
[23:38] that's kind of an identification that
[23:39] they're not a true Prophet because no
[23:41] true Prophet was ever globally
[23:43] successful
[23:44] wasn't even successful in his own home
[23:46] City
[23:48] which of the prophets Jesus said which
[23:49] of the prophets did your fathers not
[23:51] kill
[23:52] and you polished their tombs showing
[23:55] that you agree with what happened
[23:58] so you keep it going with your imagery
[24:02] so now but when we when the bride goes
[24:05] up and Satan comes down right now in the
[24:09] false prophet there's demon placeholders
[24:11] they're only there as placeholders when
[24:13] the bride goes up and Satan comes down
[24:16] he incarnates the false prophet he kicks
[24:20] the demons out and takes over and the
[24:23] false prophet becomes the Incarnate
[24:26] Beast
[24:28] see so now it's not just Beast as a
[24:31] power or an anointing it's literally
[24:33] incarnate the Beast the bride goes up
[24:36] Satan comes down incarnates the false
[24:39] prophet and he becomes the Beast
[24:41] incarnate personified as a human as a
[24:45] person all right
[24:47] so brother Brandon picks up in the
[24:49] second seal now
[24:51] as Satan is going to has incarnated
[24:54] himself
[24:55] from Antichrist to false prophet now and
[24:58] in the days of the Jews is Antichrist
[25:03] amongst the early church
[25:06] that shocks a lot of people
[25:08] they don't they think the Antichrist is
[25:09] just an end time sequence it's not the
[25:12] the apostles show that the Antichrist
[25:15] was already working in the early church
[25:16] so he says in the days of the Jews is
[25:19] Antichrist amongst the early Church in
[25:21] the Dark Ages he become a false prophet
[25:23] remember they crowned him in the fourth
[25:25] age as a false prophet
[25:28] started out as the whole thing started
[25:30] out as just a reasoning of the word and
[25:32] then it kind of became a saying and then
[25:33] it went to a Doctrine and then it became
[25:35] a person see don't don't think that
[25:38] don't think that Satan don't have that
[25:40] in his Playbook
[25:42] he starts in your mind as a as a thought
[25:45] contrary to this and after a while he
[25:48] gets you to even talk about and ruminate
[25:49] on it and after a while you become
[25:51] convinced of it and when you become
[25:53] convinced of it you become it
[25:56] see and so this is why reasoning against
[25:59] God's word is so very dangerous because
[26:04] Satan is never going to be content just
[26:06] to have you questioning
[26:08] a reasoning with it he's trying to get
[26:10] you to an Incarnation see
[26:12] all right so
[26:15] so he says now that's the all right um
[26:18] amongst the early Church in the Dark
[26:19] Ages he become a false prophet to the
[26:21] world see her there with her cup of
[26:24] iniquity
[26:25] now that's to the church age now but
[26:29] in the age after the church goes home he
[26:33] becomes a beast he becomes the devil
[26:36] incarnate the red dragon himself oh my
[26:39] can't you see what I mean he is
[26:41] Incarnate in his people then he's got
[26:44] his people Bound by his power the false
[26:48] prophet has prophesied them right into
[26:52] it
[26:54] now look at that how did the whole world
[26:56] run after the Beast the false prophet
[26:59] prophesied them right into it what's his
[27:01] prophesying preaching what's his
[27:03] preaching false teaching and the whole
[27:06] world wonders after the Beast you see so
[27:09] now just flip the script what what
[27:11] brought you to become the word made
[27:13] flesh what makes you the ministry of the
[27:15] son of man what makes you Misses Jesus
[27:17] Christ because a true Prophet has
[27:20] preached you into it
[27:22] Hallelujah
[27:27] so the false prophet has prophesied them
[27:30] right into it
[27:32] give them over to strong delusions
[27:35] to believe a lie and be damned by it
[27:39] denying the word with a form of
[27:41] godliness
[27:43] God works his place in a trinity
[27:45] justification sanctification and
[27:48] incarnate himself in his people with the
[27:50] baptism of the Holy Ghost now there
[27:51] should be no more question in your mind
[27:54] what is the baptism of the Holy Ghost it
[27:57] is God incarnating himself in you
[28:01] so it's and then Paul could say it's no
[28:04] longer I live it's Christ I died it's
[28:07] Christ that lives he is now incarnate
[28:10] inside me therefore the works that he
[28:13] did I do also therefore the life he
[28:16] lived I live also therefore the faith he
[28:18] had I have also
[28:20] amen therefore the translation he had in
[28:23] Resurrection I shall have also if that
[28:26] same spirit that was in him being you it
[28:29] shall also Quicken your mortal bodies
[28:35] so that's what the Holy Ghost is
[28:38] it's not a sensation
[28:40] it may have all kinds of Sensations it
[28:42] may produce all kinds of those things in
[28:44] your life but brother Branham said he
[28:46] said in this way I don't have the court
[28:48] in front of me you say well I speak in
[28:50] tongues you might and you might not
[28:52] well I have this sign or this miracle or
[28:54] this wonder you might and you might not
[28:55] he said but one thing you will do you
[28:58] will reproduce the life of Jesus Christ
[29:01] Hallelujah see
[29:04] so same thing the devil is just a type
[29:06] after Christ so Satan incarnates himself
[29:09] now watch when Jesus incarnates himself
[29:12] in his people the very life that was in
[29:15] Christ is in the person he moves on two
[29:18] years later to Invisible Union
[29:21] the invisible Union of the bride of
[29:22] Christ why doesn't the world recognize
[29:24] Christ in you because it's invisible
[29:28] they know you're different
[29:30] they admire your lifestyle but they
[29:32] cannot figure the secret of life how you
[29:34] got it
[29:35] see
[29:37] and you you try to offer them the path
[29:39] And when they see the path and there
[29:41] then there comes the rejection
[29:43] so brother Branham says look at the
[29:46] elected Abraham Church
[29:48] pulled out look what kind of a sign that
[29:51] Jesus himself the incarnated God
[29:54] standing there in human flesh you say
[29:58] that was an angel the Bible says it was
[30:01] God Lord God Elohim standing there in
[30:04] human flesh now that bears out go search
[30:07] your Hebrew if you have a Hebrew lexical
[30:10] Aid as I study that you find that the
[30:13] word Abraham referred to Melchizedek
[30:16] when the Bible it's Capital l-o-r-d but
[30:20] when you look at that Hebrew word that
[30:22] word is always it's never not associated
[30:28] with almighty God the Creator
[30:31] there's no instance where it's not used
[30:34] in that in that way it's all Abraham was
[30:37] not wrong in calling him capital L O R D
[30:42] Lord see so we find that it was Lord God
[30:46] Elohim standing there in human flesh
[30:50] now here's what he was showing
[30:52] say oh well he just did that to build
[30:55] Abraham's Faith well it's more than that
[30:57] well he did that to prove it to Sodom
[30:59] this is a little more than that
[31:01] this is this is going to transcend
[31:03] Millennia and come down to your day in
[31:05] my day
[31:06] Lord God Elohim standing there in human
[31:08] flesh
[31:10] showing that he would so anoint his
[31:14] church in the last days it be God
[31:19] working in human flesh again I hope you
[31:24] can absorb that today you say oh I I I
[31:27] don't think I I can quite make that kind
[31:30] of a claim then get get in your prayer
[31:33] closet
[31:34] get in the word of God because that's
[31:37] what's up that's what you say why is
[31:39] this happening in my life that's why why
[31:42] is this trial or this chaos or this
[31:44] thing going on it's because God is
[31:46] determined to bring you to that
[31:49] you are coming to the image of Christ
[31:52] and going in a Rapture and there's
[31:55] nothing you can do about it
[32:00] Hallelujah
[32:02] so I just say let me get to going Lord
[32:03] hallelujah whatever it takes in my life
[32:07] Lord God I pray that sincerely today I
[32:10] pray it all the time lord whatever it
[32:13] takes
[32:15] see
[32:18] showing that he would so anoint his
[32:20] church in the last days it'd be God
[32:22] working in human flesh again as it was
[32:24] in the days of Sodom
[32:27] so shall it be at the coming of the son
[32:30] of man
[32:31] same kind of a thing they see it now
[32:35] watch this statement they see it right
[32:37] there in the scriptures we do we can see
[32:41] it right in the scriptures it's promised
[32:43] All Through the Bible if you go to you
[32:46] know where it's I mean it's not just
[32:48] Malachi 4 or Luke 17. it's not just
[32:51] Revelation 5 and 4 and 5 and Revelation
[32:55] 7 and Revelation 10 Revelation 18. find
[32:59] yourself in Revelation 19 before he
[33:02] comes back when he comes back in
[33:05] Revelation 19 that's late in the chapter
[33:07] that's latter days that that means that
[33:10] the marriage supper has already ended
[33:12] and he's coming back now the second Woe
[33:15] Is Over the Moses Elijah have been
[33:17] killed the 144 000 have been martyred
[33:19] the foolish virgin have been martyred
[33:21] the end of the second woe behold the
[33:23] third won't cometh quickly
[33:26] and then now you see him the heavens
[33:29] open like it did in Revelation 4. now
[33:31] you see the heavens open like it did in
[33:34] the book of Isaiah in the book of
[33:35] Jeremiah The Book of Ezekiel and all
[33:36] these things and said the heavens open
[33:38] and I saw this and I saw that because
[33:40] what does the heavens opening signify a
[33:43] revelation of God is now coming down to
[33:46] his family
[33:48] and so we find that that that when he
[33:51] write the Bible says the heavens are
[33:53] open and he wrote out on a white horse a
[33:56] purity of the word and the armies of
[33:58] Heaven which was his family his bride
[34:00] she's already been raptured she's
[34:02] already been at a wedding supper this is
[34:05] the end of the end and the an Armageddon
[34:07] is coming on so don't race ahead to that
[34:10] because verses before that you get to
[34:13] what's happening right now the the the
[34:16] the bride hath made she's been called to
[34:19] the marriage of the Lamb the marriage is
[34:21] now and the bride hath made herself
[34:25] ready say what am I going to church for
[34:28] why do I listen to a tape why do I read
[34:29] my Bible because you're making yourself
[34:31] ready
[34:34] [Music]
[34:36] that's why the word is for
[34:40] yeah it's making you ready prior to
[34:44] see
[34:45] The Coming Out of Heaven on white horses
[34:50] so we have all of these things as
[34:52] brother Jack Duff says if you want to
[34:54] hear
[34:56] if you expect to hear come up
[34:59] you better first hear come out
[35:03] if you don't obey come out you'll never
[35:05] hear come up
[35:07] see
[35:09] so so we see our life right here in the
[35:13] scriptures we're not wondering I love
[35:15] this you know we're not wondering about
[35:17] the meaning of life
[35:20] that's a question that has plagued
[35:22] mankind for millennia
[35:24] what is the meaning of life
[35:26] we're not wondering anymore
[35:29] the book has been unsealed to us the
[35:32] mystery has been unfolded and we see
[35:34] ourselves in the vision Hallelujah I'm
[35:36] actually a part of this thing not
[35:38] wondering about the meaning of life
[35:40] we've preached you this morning on on
[35:42] this in the Sunday school about our
[35:44] approach to prayer and what it should be
[35:45] and the Lord already tells you his
[35:47] intentions you already know he's got
[35:50] good for you and not evil plan you
[35:52] already know he's bringing you to your
[35:53] expected end you know he might not
[35:56] reveal why you're going through this
[35:58] trial or the one you just went through
[36:00] as brother Dave as Brother David
[36:03] um gadman says you're either just come
[36:05] out of a trial or you're in a trial or
[36:08] you're going into a trial you either
[36:10] just come out you're in it or you're
[36:12] going into one because Peter said don't
[36:14] think it's strange it's for your
[36:16] development it's for your construction
[36:17] it's for your good see so God is
[36:20] bringing you to something he may not
[36:22] always reveal why the why of everything
[36:25] but I know his intention
[36:28] I know it's for my good I know it's done
[36:31] in love all I got to do is cooperate in
[36:33] the vision
[36:34] you will have a much more blessed life
[36:37] if you'll just start cooperating in the
[36:40] vision
[36:41] Hallelujah God will devastate his
[36:45] children he'll he will he will blister
[36:47] the height of his family if they refuse
[36:50] to walk in his vision for them
[36:55] I know I've been blistered
[36:58] been there done that got the T-shirt
[37:02] [Music]
[37:04] so we know our purpose for being here we
[37:07] have the opportunity friends you have
[37:09] the opportunity
[37:10] I can't force you and God won't force
[37:12] you
[37:14] all I can do is preach to you and live
[37:16] it as best I can
[37:18] all we can do is be one for all all for
[37:20] one and one for all all we can do is
[37:22] pull together all we can do is
[37:23] acknowledge We're All in This Together
[37:24] all we can do is pray for one another
[37:28] but we have the opportunity today to
[37:30] finish the work of Christ among the
[37:32] Gentiles
[37:33] and these closing scenes of History
[37:36] you have the opportunity it's offered to
[37:40] you to to enter into the ministry of the
[37:44] son of man
[37:46] say I I wasn't called to the ministry
[37:48] you're mistaken
[37:50] the entire family of God is called into
[37:52] the ministry
[37:53] your ministry might not be a Pulpit
[37:55] Ministry there's that's just one of the
[37:57] few this is there's only five of them
[37:59] kind yeah actually only four uh Apostle
[38:02] doesn't even necessarily mean a preacher
[38:03] this means one cent
[38:05] yeah so you don't even necessarily have
[38:06] to be a preacher to be a missionary and
[38:09] so so even if you do that it only
[38:11] Narrows four of them down to coming
[38:12] behind a desk like this there's many
[38:14] more forms of ministry than that
[38:18] so when we look at our Third Exodus
[38:21] parallel today
[38:23] brother Branham
[38:25] makes this statement
[38:29] and we've we've heard it before
[38:35] from the message persevering brother
[38:36] Branham describes how that according to
[38:39] the scripture
[38:41] that when the resurrection of the saints
[38:44] come
[38:44] the resurrection of all the 2000 years
[38:47] seven Church ages of church history
[38:52] that when all of those Saints rise
[38:55] say Do you believe in the return do you
[38:58] believe in Brother Brad I'm returning
[38:59] yeah
[39:00] my grandma too
[39:03] my dad too
[39:05] amen
[39:07] Hallelujah they're all coming back
[39:09] Hallelujah
[39:12] so you say well do you believe there
[39:13] will be a Ministry that Ministry is
[39:15] going on right now
[39:17] see
[39:20] so brother Brown talks about there that
[39:22] would be a great number the Bible calls
[39:24] it a number no man could number it's so
[39:25] vast but brother reminds us remember
[39:28] that's that's from 2 000 years that's an
[39:32] accumulation of seven Church ages
[39:35] and you know down around the world as
[39:37] the as the gospel from the East traveled
[39:40] to the West as the Lightning goes from
[39:41] the East to the West so shall it be to
[39:44] the coming of the son of man
[39:46] so we we find but he says but he says
[39:49] but now concerning we which are alive
[39:51] and remain those who get changed we're
[39:54] not talking about now those who come out
[39:56] of the Grave that'll be a number no man
[39:58] could number
[39:59] but he says but but on concerning the
[40:02] change there will be one in the field
[40:04] I'll take one and leave one just
[40:07] somebody come up missing
[40:09] there will listen to this there will
[40:12] just be a very
[40:14] very like Jesus truly truly
[40:18] certainly certainly brother Branham says
[40:21] there will just be a very very few in
[40:25] that rapture
[40:28] that'll be changed there will be a very
[40:30] very few in that Rapture that'll be
[40:32] changed
[40:34] now how very striking
[40:37] that the title of the sermon for that
[40:41] statement is perseverant
[40:46] so now that that informs my thinking
[40:49] perseverance must be big
[40:52] perseverance is a big Topic at the end
[40:56] time
[40:57] when it comes Rapture time we're not
[41:00] talking about the Saints coming back
[41:01] we're talking about we which are alive
[41:03] and remain to be changed in a moment in
[41:06] the twinkling of an eye now we've got to
[41:09] think about our perseverance
[41:13] see if we faint not Paul says
[41:17] yes all right
[41:19] give me brother Jason First Corinthians
[41:21] chapter 10.
[41:25] now Paul
[41:28] having realized that the second Exodus
[41:30] had just passed
[41:32] as we told you the second Exodus first
[41:34] Exodus was Moses coming out of Egypt a
[41:37] nation out of a Nation second Exodus is
[41:39] Christ resurrecting and the Saints going
[41:41] with him the Third Exodus is the Saints
[41:44] returning from the New Testament and we
[41:45] which are alive and remain shall be
[41:46] changed and we'll meet the Lord in the
[41:48] air that's the Third Exodus
[41:50] so now Paul having realized that the
[41:53] second Exodus had just passed
[41:55] looking forward now to the Third
[41:58] he reflects on the first
[42:02] Corinthians 10 he's going to give an
[42:04] outline of people
[42:06] who were interested in the first Exodus
[42:09] they were they were invested
[42:13] in the first Exodus
[42:15] moreover brethren
[42:17] I would not that you should be ignorant
[42:20] now I'm paralleling and I'm going to
[42:21] parallel one to two to three
[42:23] moreover Brethren I would not that you
[42:25] should be ignorant how that all our
[42:28] fathers I want you to notice how many
[42:29] times you're going to read the word
[42:30] a-l-l
[42:32] how that all our fathers were under the
[42:34] cloud and all passed through the sea and
[42:38] were all baptized unto Moses in the
[42:41] cloud and in the sea and did all eat the
[42:45] same spiritual meat and did all drink
[42:47] the same spiritual drink for they drank
[42:50] of that spiritual rock that followed
[42:52] them and that rock was Christ who drank
[42:53] from it all of them
[42:55] but with many
[42:58] of them God was not well pleased for
[43:01] they were overthrown in the wilderness
[43:04] now these things were our examples see
[43:08] Paul having just realized the second
[43:11] Exodus was passed he now is teaching the
[43:16] church how to receive the third and so
[43:19] he reflects back on the first amen see
[43:22] now these things were our examples to
[43:26] the intent we talked about this morning
[43:27] in our Sunday school the intention of
[43:29] God is revealed to us
[43:30] to the intent that we should not lust
[43:33] after evil things as they also lusted
[43:37] who lusted some of those who crossed the
[43:39] Red Sea with Moses drank from the
[43:41] spirits of rock ate the manner that came
[43:43] from Heaven baptized into Moses and the
[43:45] sea in the cloud see
[43:47] don't don't therefore our examples to
[43:50] the intent that we should not lust after
[43:51] evil things as they also lusted neither
[43:54] verse 7.
[43:56] neither be ye idolaters as were some of
[43:59] them as it is written the people sat
[44:02] down to eat and they rose up to play
[44:04] neither well this is a bullet list now
[44:07] this is really starting to this is
[44:08] getting serious neither let us commit
[44:10] fornication as some of them committed
[44:13] and fell in one day three and twenty
[44:15] thousand neither let us tempt Christ as
[44:18] some of them also tempted and were
[44:20] destroyed of serpents I'm not a pandemic
[44:23] boy
[44:25] neither murmur ye as some of them also
[44:29] murmured and were destroyed of the
[44:31] Destroyer now all these things happened
[44:34] unto them
[44:36] for our examples
[44:38] who's our the people of the Third Exodus
[44:40] this is for us to take a lesson
[44:43] see these are for our examples and they
[44:46] are written for our admonition unto whom
[44:49] the ends of the world are come
[44:52] all right now you've got your marker now
[44:56] you know when this is Mo when this is
[44:59] most perfectly fulfilled upon those who
[45:03] have reached the time of the ends of the
[45:06] world you are the generation upon whom
[45:09] the ends of the world have come so if
[45:12] there was every anybody that needs to
[45:15] think about what he said in the message
[45:16] perseverant and read his teaching out of
[45:21] Paul's teaching out of First Corinthians
[45:23] 10 it is now it is this group see
[45:28] now brother Branham teaches extensively
[45:31] on Paul's writings here as he always did
[45:35] and he he there's a number of places I'm
[45:38] only going to point to a handful of them
[45:40] but there's more than what I'm listing
[45:42] today
[45:43] prior to the seals in 1957 he talks
[45:46] about it a whole lot in Corinthians book
[45:49] of Correction good sermon if you want to
[45:51] go get it
[45:53] he comes in 1962 in wisdom versus Faith
[45:56] what could I say more well that sermon
[45:59] will blow your mind see he comes after
[46:01] the seals and not only after the seals
[46:04] but all the way in the last year of his
[46:06] ministry in 1965 and in and in the month
[46:10] of April in one month he covers it in
[46:12] fact is every one of these I don't know
[46:14] if there's a significance to it I
[46:16] haven't studied it out but it was
[46:18] curious to me that every one of these
[46:19] was in April
[46:21] and in April 1957 would have been the
[46:24] first Easter after Pentecost after Azusa
[46:27] and America rejected the gospel for the
[46:30] last time and judgment fell on her now
[46:32] at the at the resurrection at Easter
[46:35] time he's preaching on Corinthians book
[46:38] of Correction why didn't you go in the
[46:40] Rapture why haven't we gone yet what's
[46:41] the problem with our churches let's go
[46:43] to Corinthians book of Correction
[46:46] he's still preaching to them in 62 in
[46:48] April wisdom versus Faith he comes in
[46:51] 1965 and in one month does God ever
[46:54] change his mind about his word
[46:58] One in a Million
[47:01] there's got to be a people who prove
[47:03] brother Brown said to prove they're not
[47:06] like Eve they're not she's not that kind
[47:09] of a woman this Pride of the last day is
[47:12] a virgin to the word and she will not
[47:14] receive the seed of another man she
[47:17] keeps herself strictly to Christ
[47:21] amen and finally choosing of a bride
[47:26] where brother Branham takes this and
[47:28] really begins to break it down I think
[47:30] it would be important to us to look at
[47:31] it
[47:33] now Paul has went down this this laundry
[47:36] list of
[47:38] of people who were not well pleasing and
[47:41] how they got overthrown they lusted
[47:43] after evil things they were idolaters
[47:46] and they were foreign fornicators and
[47:48] and they tempted Christ and they
[47:50] murmured and and so when we when we
[47:53] start to look at these things you start
[47:55] to look at the at the parallel in the
[47:58] second Exodus I could just let me just
[48:00] take you to the second one just in order
[48:01] to come back to this first one
[48:03] I mean when I look at the upper room
[48:06] experience
[48:08] and there was 120 people
[48:10] I'm thinking to my and this was this is
[48:13] the way my quirky mind thinks and I was
[48:14] thinking about that I thought 120 people
[48:16] wow how was there not at least five
[48:18] thousand
[48:20] but I mean he just fed that many
[48:22] twice
[48:24] and not even counting women and children
[48:27] twice
[48:29] he took two fish and Five Loaves and
[48:33] broke off baked bread and cooked fish
[48:37] and just crept creating cooked fish and
[48:39] baked bread and fed five thousand men
[48:41] not counting women and children and they
[48:43] took up 12 baskets full
[48:44] and he did it a second time and they
[48:46] took up I think seven baskets full how
[48:48] where were those five thousand
[48:50] how was it only 120 people could put
[48:53] yourself there for for just a moment how
[48:55] could they see that and and know that he
[48:57] walked on the water
[49:02] he spoke and raised dead people
[49:06] Simon cuts the air off of a high priest
[49:09] servant and Jesus reaches down picks it
[49:11] up out of the dirt and reconnects it
[49:13] and doesn't need surgery
[49:16] there's reconnection is totally healed I
[49:19] mean how could they see that you they
[49:21] they they had already they already had
[49:23] Temple guards saying saying why didn't
[49:25] you arrest him we sent you to arrest him
[49:27] and they said never a man spanked like
[49:29] this
[49:31] we can't even put it into words we just
[49:33] never heard anyone talk like that
[49:36] how were they not all there
[49:38] how they how they they the Sanhedrin and
[49:41] Nicodemus comes in the middle of the
[49:43] night and says we know you're of God we
[49:45] the San Hayden we know because what we
[49:47] know is that nobody can do what you're
[49:49] doing
[49:50] now we've had people who could do
[49:52] Miracles but we've never had anyone do
[49:55] what you're doing since the days of
[49:56] Abraham and Melchizedek when he
[49:58] discerned the heart thoughts of a woman
[50:01] sitting behind him and that had never
[50:03] happened and he said we know that nobody
[50:06] can do that you're reproducing that we
[50:10] know you must be of God
[50:16] And yet when the Holy Ghost fell
[50:18] there's 120 people is it any Wonder then
[50:22] that in that day of the second Exodus
[50:25] not all the graves
[50:26] opened
[50:28] brother Adam says who was the ones that
[50:30] opened it was the ones who had the truth
[50:32] not just because they were Jewish
[50:34] but the ones who had the true Faith Seed
[50:37] of Abraham
[50:39] who believed God's word their whole life
[50:41] didn't say they were perfect people but
[50:43] they had a perfect Faith toward God's
[50:45] covenant promise
[50:47] see and so so so we find that that not
[50:51] all of them came up can you imagine can
[50:53] you imagine for a moment
[50:55] being a Jew and you were you've got
[50:59] family records that you can prove
[51:03] unequivocally
[51:05] unmistakably you can bring out your
[51:08] family record my daddy his daddy his
[51:10] daddy his daddy his daddy his daddy his
[51:12] daddy his daddy his uh Abraham
[51:17] and Jesus even told them they said we
[51:19] Abraham's Our Father and Jesus didn't
[51:21] deny that
[51:22] he didn't argue with them on that I said
[51:24] I know you're Abraham's children but
[51:25] here's a curious thing you're trying to
[51:26] kill me and Abraham really didn't do
[51:28] that
[51:28] hahaha
[51:31] Abraham rejoiced to see my day and yet
[51:34] you're trying to kill me now that begins
[51:36] to show me something that though you're
[51:37] the lineage of Abraham you're the
[51:39] children of the devil
[51:40] because you're he was a liar and a
[51:42] murderer from the beginning and I see
[51:44] lying and murdering in you and why is it
[51:46] you can't understand my speech why can
[51:48] my word not find a place in you see
[51:51] and so can you imagine can you imagine
[51:54] being a a full-blooded Jew
[51:57] and the thing the most epic event of the
[52:01] whole reason you are a Jew is that God's
[52:03] going to establish a kingdom of Jew of
[52:06] Jews in the Earth where on the throne of
[52:08] David
[52:09] and and Israel's going to become the
[52:12] epicenter of the whole world and Justice
[52:14] is going to flow out of there in the
[52:16] millennium
[52:17] that's the son of David can you imagine
[52:20] that your whole life and your birth and
[52:22] everything you've been taught from a
[52:23] child and you've been raised to believe
[52:25] it and you are it and it's not a joke
[52:27] and you haven't just imagined you're a
[52:29] Jew you're a for real one
[52:31] and your Messiah the event you've
[52:34] weighed it on for thousands of years
[52:38] and he rises from the dead and you don't
[52:41] go with him
[52:45] now you wonder why there be weeping and
[52:48] wailing and gnashing of teeth
[52:50] and and and the false church that spent
[52:52] their life building hospitals and
[52:54] schools and saying we preached and did
[52:56] Mighty works and did all this in your
[52:58] name and he will say depart from me you
[53:01] workers of iniquity I never knew you
[53:04] your faith was artificial you're just
[53:07] trying to you're just trying to earn
[53:09] your salvation and you cannot earn it
[53:11] there's no way to earn it it's got to be
[53:13] the grace of God and that comes through
[53:15] the administration of Faith by by faith
[53:19] you are saved through Grace
[53:21] by Grace you are saved through faith
[53:25] see
[53:27] so it is a faith in the revealed word
[53:30] that's where Grace is embedded
[53:35] that's why when the Gentile bride leaves
[53:37] the Earth Grace is over for the Gentiles
[53:40] they'll still come to altars still
[53:42] crying still believe they're getting
[53:43] saved they're not
[53:44] see you you go to you you find that in
[53:47] in the in Revelation 21 he that's filthy
[53:50] is filthy still he that's rights is
[53:53] righteous still so so we see these
[53:56] parallels from the first Exodus to the
[53:58] second Exodus to the Third Exodus
[54:01] I mean you know when when they are you
[54:04] know when when we think about if you go
[54:07] back and look at some of these
[54:08] references that Paul
[54:10] is referencing you have to go chase it
[54:12] because Paul doesn't say where he just
[54:14] says here's what was going on and here's
[54:16] what was going on and they were lusting
[54:18] and they were murmuring and and and and
[54:19] and and and and what was some of his
[54:22] others he says uh so they're they're
[54:24] lusting and they're murmuring and
[54:26] they're complaining and you know they're
[54:28] they're they're lusting after evil
[54:30] things and they're idolaters and and and
[54:32] fornication you know lusting after evil
[54:35] things I mean you know that's what
[54:38] happened to Lot's wife
[54:40] see because she was told you got to make
[54:44] a total separation from unbelief
[54:47] don't even look back
[54:50] but she had to she could not overcome
[54:53] herself
[54:55] she had to make one last lustful gaze
[54:58] you see
[55:00] like Brother David Samuel made a point
[55:02] on that morning Bible study I've never
[55:03] forgotten so so noteworthy and worth
[55:06] repeating
[55:07] and he said he said you know yes sister
[55:11] lot left
[55:13] you know she left the boundaries of
[55:16] Sodom she left that City physically said
[55:21] but the problem was when she she turned
[55:23] to look and she turned to a pillar of
[55:24] salt she turned she she went one last
[55:28] lustful look and it was the last thing
[55:30] she ever did in life
[55:33] and he says the reason is is because
[55:35] though she left the boundaries of the
[55:37] city she had already built a metropolis
[55:40] in her heart
[55:42] and she couldn't let that go see and so
[55:46] they were overthrown in the wilderness
[55:48] lusting after evil things
[55:50] neither be idolaters of some as some of
[55:53] them as it is written the people sat
[55:55] down to eat and drink and Rose up to
[55:57] play they sat down to enjoy the
[55:59] blessings of God just like you're
[56:00] sitting here today
[56:02] but the allurements the the playful
[56:04] allormons the the contaminating poisons
[56:07] of the world you know the the the the
[56:09] the movie stars and the sports start let
[56:13] me change it movie idols and sports
[56:16] idols and financial idols and political
[56:19] idols and it's all idolatry
[56:24] and why does he preach in perseverance
[56:27] but only be a very very few make that
[56:30] Rapture that should speak to us today
[56:32] does it speak to you today
[56:35] this is not a time to have Idols ahead
[56:37] of the word of God
[56:39] say how do I know if I got Idols what
[56:41] what's the direction of your life what
[56:43] what's more important to you what you
[56:45] want or what he wants in your life
[56:49] see
[56:51] fornication as some of them committed
[56:53] and fell in one day I mean look
[56:55] fornication is a physical deed that
[56:58] follows a spiritual fornication that's
[57:01] why you that's why you see in in the
[57:04] Christian in the Christian nominal world
[57:06] so many preachers and even within ranks
[57:09] of every denomination even within ranks
[57:10] of the message of the hour you find that
[57:12] they commit a physical fornication
[57:15] physical adultery and it's because it
[57:18] almost always is preceded by spiritual
[57:20] adultery and they they commit spiritual
[57:23] adultery against God's word they
[57:25] disbelieve it and change it and make it
[57:27] fit what they want and that's adultery
[57:28] that's fornication and because you say
[57:30] why does it lead to physical adultery
[57:32] because it's the same spirit
[57:35] it's brother man said it's the exact
[57:36] same demon spirit
[57:39] see it's like I said to you this is why
[57:42] the Holy Ghost is so important to give
[57:43] you a new birth because if you don't
[57:45] have your nature changed
[57:49] as I said to you
[57:51] there's so many versions of the Gospel
[57:57] say how many well denominations and
[58:00] organized Christian movements there's
[58:01] north of 33 000 of them
[58:05] so there's a lot of versions
[58:07] of the Gospel say I thought there is
[58:09] only one gospel there's only one true
[58:11] gospel
[58:12] but there's there's tens of thousands of
[58:16] versions
[58:17] you see and if you don't get a new birth
[58:19] if you don't get that Fallen nature
[58:22] changed you'll hunt around until you
[58:26] find a version of The Gospel that you
[58:28] want to be true
[58:31] and you you want he said oh there's a
[58:33] version that'll let me do this and do
[58:35] that and do this and I can be free and I
[58:36] can still believe in Jesus but I can
[58:38] still have this in my life and that in
[58:39] my life and this my life and all kinds
[58:41] of idols and all kinds of fornications
[58:42] spiritual and natural and it doesn't
[58:44] matter that's a version of The Gospel
[58:46] it's out there it's for sale if you want
[58:48] it
[58:50] but it's not the one dripping with blood
[58:52] [Applause]
[58:55] I'm here to taste something this version
[58:57] is dripping with blood
[58:59] and I will not stand by and let this
[59:02] version be cheapened I will not let it
[59:04] be cheap and this gospel is dripping
[59:06] with the blood of Martyrs
[59:09] it's worth standing for
[59:12] neither tempted Christ as some of them
[59:15] tempted see they you know what you know
[59:17] what they're and then they and they
[59:18] started murmuring and and God sent the
[59:21] serpents among them and sent a destroyer
[59:22] among them you know you know what they
[59:24] were
[59:25] you know what you know what they were
[59:27] tempting Christ with and murmuring about
[59:29] they didn't like the way
[59:32] go back into the Book of Numbers you'll
[59:33] find all this
[59:35] chapter 14 I think chapter 21 I believe
[59:37] they didn't like the path God had chose
[59:41] for them they didn't like this desert we
[59:43] want to go back to Egypt we remember
[59:45] this and the garlics and all of this and
[59:47] now you brought us out here and there's
[59:48] no water and what are we going to do and
[59:50] this bread we hate this bread it is I'm
[59:52] sick of eating this bread and where's
[59:54] the meat and you know and where's how
[59:55] are we going to do this and complaining
[59:57] I'm here to tell you something friends
[59:59] the lesson that they learned is is that
[1:00:01] that Christ is not here to serve you
[1:00:06] Christ is here for you to serve him and
[1:00:09] you don't ever want to put him in the
[1:00:11] roll in a reversal role of of making
[1:00:13] your life what you want it to be you
[1:00:16] need to say I want to die I took my own
[1:00:18] my own desires I want his life whatever
[1:00:21] it is whatever's the cost
[1:00:28] and it's upon the age
[1:00:30] upon whom the ends of the world are come
[1:00:32] that's you and me
[1:00:36] so we found out that the presence of
[1:00:38] Supernatural privileges
[1:00:40] in the lives of the Old Testament
[1:00:42] Israelites did not produce automatic
[1:00:44] success no
[1:00:46] on the contrary
[1:00:48] in spite of their
[1:00:50] special advantages most of them all but
[1:00:53] two actually of of the original
[1:00:54] generation Joshua and Caleb
[1:00:57] uh all but two of them were disqualified
[1:01:00] and died in the desert
[1:01:03] see
[1:01:06] here it is numbers 21 give me that
[1:01:07] brother Jason numbers 21 4-6 we should
[1:01:10] read it
[1:01:13] this is tempting Christ neither let us
[1:01:15] tempt Christ remember our ninth verse
[1:01:17] neither let us tempt Christ as some of
[1:01:19] them also tempted or destroyed of
[1:01:20] serpents here it is here's what he's
[1:01:22] referring to numbers 21 4-6
[1:01:24] and they journeyed from Mount hore by
[1:01:26] the way of the Red Sea to Compass the
[1:01:27] land of Edom and the soul of the people
[1:01:30] was much discouraged because of the way
[1:01:34] and the people spoke against God and
[1:01:36] against Moses wherefore have you brought
[1:01:39] us up out of Egypt to die in the
[1:01:41] wilderness this is not just to Moses
[1:01:43] it's the god
[1:01:45] for there is no bread neither is there
[1:01:47] any water and our soul loatheth this
[1:01:50] light bread
[1:01:52] and the Lord sent fiery serpents among
[1:01:54] the people and they bit the people and
[1:01:56] much people of Israel died
[1:01:59] so we never we must never try to get
[1:02:02] Christ to serve us instead of us serving
[1:02:04] him they tried that and it didn't end
[1:02:06] well God launched an epidemic of
[1:02:08] poisonous snakes among them
[1:02:12] so very few make that Rapture the same
[1:02:16] lust for the world
[1:02:19] the same never coming to a new birth
[1:02:21] which you have to you can only surrender
[1:02:23] your way to
[1:02:25] see
[1:02:26] you you'll you'll choose whichever
[1:02:28] version of The Gospel that you wish was
[1:02:30] true idolaters
[1:02:33] chasing Idols of this oh what this
[1:02:36] crashing world
[1:02:38] chasing Idols come on teenagers chasing
[1:02:42] Idols from a crashing world
[1:02:47] oh my fornication spiritual physical
[1:02:51] Same Spirit self-serving attitude
[1:02:54] that literally pushes God past his
[1:02:56] limits of Mercy which you can exhaust
[1:02:58] not his grace Of course brother says you
[1:03:01] can never exhaust his grace he said but
[1:03:02] I have exhausted his Mercy many times
[1:03:05] murmuring against the word
[1:03:08] oh yeah they do it today where's the
[1:03:10] promise of his coming
[1:03:13] and that's not just his physical coming
[1:03:15] in fact is when you go to the to the
[1:03:17] Greek it's where is the promise of his
[1:03:18] parisia
[1:03:20] you might know the word more Perugia
[1:03:22] it's a mispronunciation of the Greek
[1:03:24] word where is the promise of his perusa
[1:03:26] his parasia
[1:03:28] for nothing has changed and all things
[1:03:31] are the same you see it's not it's not
[1:03:33] just about the coming of his physical
[1:03:34] coming it's where's This Promise of the
[1:03:38] word to be made flesh I can't even live
[1:03:40] from day to day as an overcomer where is
[1:03:42] the Holy Ghost I thought I was supposed
[1:03:44] to have power
[1:03:46] where's the promise I I was told that it
[1:03:48] would come upon me and it would change
[1:03:49] my whole nature it will if you get the
[1:03:52] real thing Hallelujah if you get the
[1:03:55] real fire breathing experience it'll
[1:03:58] change everything say well I still have
[1:04:00] to battle you of course you will you're
[1:04:02] still in an unconverted flesh but
[1:04:04] there's power Wonder working power
[1:04:07] in the blood of the lamb and in the word
[1:04:09] of this hour Hallelujah friends
[1:04:17] and that's the hour that we have arrived
[1:04:19] at this is why
[1:04:21] brother Brandon would talk about and I I
[1:04:23] said this to you
[1:04:25] uh recently about the term consummation
[1:04:30] the consummation of the ages
[1:04:33] and I've turned my last corner now you
[1:04:35] still with me
[1:04:36] all right I'm gonna take these last 15
[1:04:37] minutes
[1:04:40] so
[1:04:42] we find then that
[1:04:45] brother Brandon would use this word more
[1:04:48] than 90 times
[1:04:50] curiously that I don't know who was
[1:04:53] responsible but you don't you won't find
[1:04:55] all of them if you don't it's even
[1:04:56] spelled differently in different ones
[1:04:58] and I'm not sure how that happened in
[1:04:59] the book on the tape it's always just
[1:05:01] the word consummation
[1:05:02] uh the consummation of the ages and
[1:05:04] brother Branham talks about it nearly a
[1:05:05] hundred times so it's an important topic
[1:05:08] you would agree
[1:05:10] consummation
[1:05:13] he starts talking about
[1:05:15] you know the consummation of the ages
[1:05:18] the consummation of the seals the
[1:05:20] consummation of everything it's the
[1:05:22] seven of all sevens
[1:05:24] it's the bride has now come full circle
[1:05:26] the word has went back to grain
[1:05:29] see laying I've been preaching on you
[1:05:31] she must lay in the presence of the sun
[1:05:33] to be ripened that's the problem and the
[1:05:35] bride he's got all kinds of problems in
[1:05:37] in the Azusa Revival those remnants of
[1:05:39] whatever's left of it but it's obvious
[1:05:42] he wasn't talking to the bride because
[1:05:43] they're he's hitting them for their
[1:05:46] painted face and their Jezebel ways and
[1:05:47] cutting their hair and wearing pants and
[1:05:49] Men drinking smoking Corrals and cussing
[1:05:51] so he's not talking about the bride we
[1:05:52] don't we don't stand for that in the
[1:05:54] message of the hour it's not not the not
[1:05:56] the real message
[1:05:57] and so but but he does come to the real
[1:06:00] message and say now there is a problem
[1:06:02] and the real message
[1:06:04] and that is we are a seed we have come
[1:06:07] back to grain but boy we're Mighty green
[1:06:09] we got to lay in the presence of the sun
[1:06:11] now I don't believe in just saying that
[1:06:12] forever he said he said that 60 years
[1:06:15] ago I mean eventually we've got to get
[1:06:16] mature right
[1:06:18] eventually you can't just keep saying
[1:06:20] well someday somewhere
[1:06:22] [Music]
[1:06:24] the rainbow
[1:06:33] it's right now
[1:06:35] it's right now
[1:06:37] the consummation of the ages the
[1:06:39] perfecting of the ages I was preaching

[1:06:42] when I was on this subject that this is

[1:10:14] oh we've been playing this Symphony for
[1:10:16] a long time friends
[1:10:18] oh we've had crescendos and crescendos
[1:10:20] and we've had great musicians and
[1:10:22] they've come and gone and we had great
[1:10:24] worries of Faith Among Us and and and
[1:10:26] and and we lost a lot of our first chair
[1:10:28] violinists and thank God we had other
[1:10:30] ones to jump in the place we lost some
[1:10:32] of our pianists and God had other ones
[1:10:33] to jump in the place we lost some of our
[1:10:35] generals but God's got other ministers
[1:10:37] rising up young ministers even right now
[1:10:40] even right now friends say why this
[1:10:42] close to the Rapture why is God still
[1:10:44] calling young ministers because it was
[1:10:46] the Young Generation with Joshua that
[1:10:48] took the land
[1:10:50] Hallelujah friends we're marching to
[1:10:52] Zion beautiful beautiful Zion
[1:10:55] [Applause]
[1:10:57] brother Branham says and I read this to
[1:10:59] you the anointing time and sign what did
[1:11:01] he say Malachi 4 would restore
[1:11:05] back to the original Pentecostal faith
[1:11:08] this is the upper room now
[1:11:10] don't confuse that term that's a
[1:11:12] misnomer to call Azusa that they called
[1:11:14] themselves that because they thought
[1:11:16] they were the long-awaited restoration
[1:11:17] and brother Brandon went along with it
[1:11:19] just out of courtesy but he clearly
[1:11:21] showed in his teaching that that because
[1:11:24] they denominated it proved they were not
[1:11:27] what they thought they were
[1:11:29] they were only a portion of what was
[1:11:31] coming see
[1:11:34] so what did he say
[1:11:36] in Malachi 4 would restore restore back
[1:11:38] the original Pentecostal Faith that's
[1:11:41] the upper room
[1:11:42] that's Jubilee that's the abstract title
[1:11:45] put back into the hands of God's family
[1:11:47] again remember Adam lost it God gives it
[1:11:50] back
[1:11:51] Hallelujah
[1:11:52] I don't care what the devil has taken
[1:11:54] from you in this life in this day Jesus
[1:11:57] Christ gives it back you just rejoice in
[1:11:59] that I don't care what you've missed out
[1:12:01] on and you might have even been a party
[1:12:03] to it but Jesus Christ gives it back
[1:12:06] Hallelujah it doesn't matter how far
[1:12:09] away you find yourself this is the hour
[1:12:11] of all things
[1:12:14] Hallelujah
[1:12:16] back to the people with the same
[1:12:18] Pentecostal message the same Pentecostal
[1:12:21] sign the same Pentecostal evidence the
[1:12:24] same God the same power the same
[1:12:27] teaching and love this all-inclusive
[1:12:29] everything exactly
[1:12:32] with the Vindication of the same Pillar
[1:12:34] of Fire that struck Saul down on the
[1:12:35] road to Damascus in him is among us
[1:12:37] today doing the same signs that he did
[1:12:40] in that day say well sum it up in one
[1:12:43] word uniting
[1:12:45] that's what it's all about friends
[1:12:48] it's about uniting time and sign there
[1:12:52] if there's a uniting time and We Know by
[1:12:56] prophecy there is then there has to be a
[1:13:00] uniting sign maybe if it's a uniting
[1:13:03] time there has to be a uniting sign it
[1:13:06] can't just come and have no effect in
[1:13:08] the earth it has had an effect it has
[1:13:10] come out of her my people and come up
[1:13:13] into a new day arise shine thy light has
[1:13:16] come and it's literally changing a bride
[1:13:18] into the image of the word
[1:13:22] you see listen
[1:13:26] sometimes
[1:13:28] we can really
[1:13:31] get down on ourself and think and and
[1:13:33] let the devil you know play a sob story
[1:13:36] to us
[1:13:38] no I just fail and I fail and I fail
[1:13:40] again and after I failed and I fail I
[1:13:42] even fail at failing and fail some more
[1:13:45] and it might seemed like so many times
[1:13:48] and I read in the Bible and I hear these
[1:13:49] preachers saying oh it's such a
[1:13:51] wonderful thing I wish it was me I see
[1:13:52] everybody rejoicing oh I just wish I
[1:13:54] could Rejoice with them I wish I could
[1:13:55] feel like I was a part of that thing let
[1:13:57] me tell you something friends there is a
[1:13:59] uniting time and there has to be a
[1:14:01] uniting sign and that's you and that was
[1:14:04] always God's plan and don't don't
[1:14:06] despise the day of small things let me
[1:14:09] tell you something God is doing more in
[1:14:12] you than you're aware of
[1:14:14] I'm here to tell you while the world is
[1:14:17] falling away further and further and
[1:14:19] further you're getting closer and closer
[1:14:22] and closer while the world is going more
[1:14:25] and more crazy you're coming more and
[1:14:27] more into faith I know you might feel
[1:14:29] weak I know you might be a failure you
[1:14:31] might have had a failure on your way to
[1:14:33] church but I'm here to tell you God is
[1:14:35] in control he's in control of your lives
[1:14:38] and all he ever has needed what he needs
[1:14:41] is all he's ever needed a total
[1:14:43] surrender
[1:14:48] I mean listen
[1:14:50] this is exactly what the prophecy was
[1:14:52] where we read in book of Acts yeah
[1:14:55] you men of Galilee
[1:14:57] why are you standing here gazing at this
[1:15:01] don't you know there's a reality to be
[1:15:03] poured out you need to get going

[1:15:11] you're bewildered and I want to go with
[1:15:13] him let you've got a mission
[1:15:16] let me give you some good news he said
[1:15:18] to him
[1:15:20] the same one that you've seen go up
[1:15:24] he'll come down just like you've seen
[1:15:26] him go up

[1:15:37] body lays on the altar and that life is
[1:15:40] sent back down into the church it came
[1:15:43] down just like it went up
[1:15:46] and when it came down It produced the
[1:15:51] body of Christ like the one that went up
[1:15:57] Church into a many membered body of the
[1:16:01] one man that ascended as you see him go
[1:16:03] so shall he come again and when he came
[1:16:06] again it went from 1 to 120 and it went
[1:16:10] from 120 to thousand and it went around
[1:16:12] the world and we're rejoicing in it
[1:16:14] today and now we've come to the end
[1:16:17] we've come to laodicea and now what's
[1:16:20] happening the very thing that came down
[1:16:22] and produced a body when that body at
[1:16:25] the end time goes up it'll be just like
[1:16:28] when he came down
[1:16:30] just like this that's all that's all
[1:16:32] that's happening in the same way he came
[1:16:34] and produced a body when he's ready to
[1:16:37] go up in a body he that ledeth will
[1:16:39] actually be taken out of the way that's
[1:16:41] Christ in the bride when that one came
[1:16:43] down in a many member body now he's
[1:16:45] ready to go up in a many-membered body
[1:16:47] and he'll go up just like he came down
[1:16:50] and there will be a body of Believers
[1:16:53] there'll be a people with the full
[1:16:56] authority of the word of God for this
[1:16:58] hour

[1:17:12] the Lamb has come
[1:17:14] and the pride
[1:17:16] has made herself ready
[1:17:20] as he went away
[1:17:22] so would he come again
[1:17:24] and when he goes away it'll be just like
[1:17:27] when he came
[1:17:29] it'll turn and transform a people into
[1:17:33] the Living Word and when they leave when
[1:17:37] they leave just like brother Henry

[1:17:59] purpose in life that's what I'm longing
[1:18:01] for that's what I'm living for and I
[1:18:04] know that that is true and I know I'm a
[1:18:07] part of it and I can't deny it and I I
[1:18:10] don't think I earn it I don't think I
[1:18:12] deserve it but I know I'm a part of it
[1:18:15] oh I could have never done it to myself
[1:18:17] but God rich and mercy has identified
[1:18:22] himself has he been unveiled to you

[1:18:29] what take a family at the end time up
