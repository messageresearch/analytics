[0:00] welcome out on this rainy, gloomy day.
[0:03] We pray that it's uh maybe gloomy
[0:05] outside, but it wouldn't be gloomy in
[0:07] our hearts. It's easy for the for the
[0:10] outside to come in, but let's let the
[0:12] light shine out from us instead of all
[0:16] this uh lack of sunshine and rain that's
[0:18] coming. Let's uh let's focus on Christ.
[0:21] Amen. Let's pray. Let's let's stand and
[0:25] we'll pray. Brother Mark, if you want to
[0:27] bring the PowerPoint up, that'd be
[0:28] great.
[0:30] Heavenly Father, we just want to commit
[0:31] this time to you, Lord. We ask that by
[0:34] your Holy Spirit, you'd come and take
[0:36] your word and write it upon our hearts,
[0:37] Father, because we know that's that's
[0:40] the place where change and
[0:41] transformation comes. It's it's not by
[0:43] emotions. It's not by our feelings. It's
[0:45] not it's not by the word of some man,
[0:49] Lord, but it's your word being taken and
[0:52] written in our hearts, Lord. That's what
[0:53] changes us and transforms us and makes
[0:57] us into Jesus Christ, Lord. And it's you
[0:59] coming to confront us over our uh
[1:03] sinfulness, over our selfishness, Lord,
[1:06] over things, Lord, that have been
[1:08] controlling us. And you bringing
[1:11] revelation that would deliver us from uh
[1:14] the things that are hindering us.
[1:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17] &gt;&gt; Lord, and it can be simple things and it
[1:19] can be big things, Lord. But you're the
[1:20] great deliverer. And we look to you,
[1:23] commit ourselves to you in Jesus name.
[1:25] Amen.
[1:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. I guess I'm not even starting with
[1:28] the scripture this morning. So, thanks
[1:29] for standing up. It's good to exercise.
[1:32] You can sit down again.
[1:35] So, we're continuing on the life of
[1:36] Christ part six. And just want to
[1:39] quickly review the definition of love
[1:42] that we talked about last time. Before
[1:44] that, want to remind you of the four
[1:46] loves
[1:47] that we talked about. Agape love, which
[1:49] is is divine love. That's the love of
[1:52] God. Comes from a source outside of
[1:54] ourselves. It's not from internal to us,
[1:59] but it's from external to us into us
[2:02] because it's the love the agape of God
[2:06] shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy
[2:08] Ghost which is given to us. So him in us
[2:11] loving out to others. Then there's
[2:14] filelio love which speaks of friendship.
[2:17] Stoay love which speaks of affection.
[2:20] Aeros which is sexual love. And as long
[2:24] as everything is ordered correctly,
[2:26] human love is just fine. But without God
[2:30] in the middle of it, human love will
[2:32] never be ordered correctly. It'll all be
[2:35] disordered and perverted. And I think
[2:38] that's really the main kind of the main
[2:41] focus of what I want to talk about this
[2:43] time is when love gets disordered. So
[2:48] defining love, love is a power
[2:51] or force. Brother Brandham tells us that
[2:53] it's the most powerful force in the
[2:56] world is love. That's what ch that's
[2:58] what brings change. That's what brings
[3:00] transformation is when God's love is
[3:02] extended to us. So when it's God's love
[3:06] in us, it's a a power or force to extend
[3:08] yourself for the highest good of others.
[3:12] What is the highest good of others?
[3:14] &gt;&gt; That they're comfortable.
[3:17] No, that they grow spiritually.
[3:19] &gt;&gt; That's what we spoke about before. God's
[3:21] love is his election. And how is he his
[3:24] election expressed? He allows us to go
[3:27] through very difficult things and hard
[3:30] things in order to cause us to grow up
[3:32] into the head which is Christ. And so if
[3:36] that love expressed in and through us
[3:38] will be expressed in the same way which
[3:39] is causing us causing others ourselves
[3:43] included even in this to grow
[3:46] spiritually and in turn help others to
[3:49] grow spiritually. So it's when you can
[3:51] extend yourself for the other person to
[3:54] help them to grow in Christ. That's what
[3:58] love is. And that's probably the the if
[4:00] we look at love, it is like the greatest
[4:05] uh deception that the world has today.
[4:08] And they use love more so as a club to
[4:12] beat over the heads of other people to
[4:14] control them than they do for what it
[4:17] really is. What what is what love is is
[4:21] not controlling other people.
[4:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:24] &gt;&gt; Love sets free God God we love God
[4:31] because we choose to love God. Now we
[4:33] can talk about the process of salvation
[4:35] the inner working of that etc. That's
[4:38] another story. But love is only love
[4:41] when we freely give it. If we are forced
[4:44] externally
[4:46] to love a person then it isn't love
[4:50] actually it's fear or something else.
[4:54] &gt;&gt; So love is only love when it's freely
[4:56] given.
[4:58] So
[5:00] like we spoke about last time at at the
[5:02] same time you know it's it's love is
[5:05] done expressed automatically like the
[5:08] people in Matthew 25. When did we visit
[5:11] you? When were you sick and imprisoning?
[5:13] When did we do we didn't even know we
[5:14] did this. It just happened out of the
[5:17] abundance of their heart. They love was
[5:19] expressed to visit and to provide and to
[5:23] help to do something. So we can also
[5:25] gather that love is not a feeling but
[5:29] love is an action.
[5:32] Love is also hard work and effort.
[5:36] Because part of being able to love
[5:38] others is you have to examine yourself
[5:40] and your motives. Because it comes down
[5:43] to if you don't understand the motives
[5:45] and objectives of your own heart, you
[5:47] might be doing something out of uh
[5:50] coercion.
[5:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[5:52] &gt;&gt; Or force or fear.
[5:55] Or you're doing something you have no
[5:57] clue that you're doing it that's
[5:58] damaging a person, that's hurting a
[6:01] person, that's hindering their growth.
[6:02] And you think you're loving them. What
[6:05] you're doing is you're damaging them.
[6:06] You're hurting them. And that is
[6:09] actually if you look at what evil is.
[6:13] Really examine what what is evil, you'll
[6:16] understand that evil people don't know
[6:19] that they're evil. They think usually
[6:22] they think they are the best.
[6:24] &gt;&gt; That's correct.
[6:24] &gt;&gt; They usually think they're the most
[6:26] loving, the most caring. That's their
[6:29] impression of themselves. and they never
[6:32] take the time to examine the fruit of
[6:34] their life. Hey, there's chaos all
[6:36] around me. People are uncomfortable.
[6:38] They're fearful. That's their problem.
[6:40] &gt;&gt; That's what the evil person says. That
[6:43] is their problem. I'm just a normal
[6:45] person doing normal things. I've done my
[6:48] best to do this. So, they always see the
[6:52] goodness in themselves, but can never
[6:54] recognize the evil. Truly loving people
[6:57] recognize their own capabilities for
[7:00] selfishness and evil.
[7:02] Truly evil people always find a
[7:06] scapegoat.
[7:08] We'll talk about that a little bit more.
[7:11] Genuine agape love requires
[7:13] self-examination,
[7:15] searching our motives and considering
[7:17] why we do what we do and working to
[7:20] order love correctly according to the
[7:23] word.
[7:25] Right? Love is not love if it's
[7:27] disordered. Love must be ordered
[7:29] properly according to the word. If you
[7:32] love people more than God, you say, "Oh,
[7:35] I'm I'm a very loving person." No,
[7:37] you're not.
[7:41] &gt;&gt; You have to love God first.
[7:44] &gt;&gt; You know, you have a preacher and he
[7:46] says, "I I love this church with all my
[7:48] heart and I've put all my effort and all
[7:51] my strength into it." Meanwhile, his
[7:52] wife is miserable. his children are
[7:54] falling by the wayside. His his family
[7:57] is destroyed. They're they're very
[7:59] uncomfortable and very happy. That's not
[8:01] love. You don't love your congregation
[8:05] because you'd love your family first if
[8:07] you had real love. Because God says to
[8:10] order it this way, not another way.
[8:15] Evil can never recognize the evil that
[8:18] it's doing. It always blames it on it's
[8:20] somebody else's fault and problem. I'm
[8:23] getting way ahead of myself. I don't
[8:24] know why I keep emphasizing that. Stick
[8:26] to the notes.
[8:30] Genuine agape love requires
[8:32] self-examination. What do I mean by
[8:33] that? It's hard work because we are all
[8:37] fall we're in fallen flesh.
[8:40] &gt;&gt; There is a part of us that just wants to
[8:42] serve yourself. And so we'll create
[8:45] elaborate schemes of religion
[8:49] &gt;&gt; to show forth that we are doing it
[8:52] right, that we're okay, that we're that
[8:55] we don't need to change.
[8:58] Rule 101. Someone that has love is
[9:00] always realizing and he just needs to
[9:02] change and grow. Amen.
[9:04] &gt;&gt; If I were to raise my children exactly
[9:07] the same way my parents raised children,
[9:10] I would be evil
[9:13] because the the the age that we're
[9:15] living in right now is so drastically
[9:17] different
[9:19] &gt;&gt; than how I was raised, how my parents
[9:22] were raised. If we just stuck with that
[9:23] exact same model and mode, we would lose
[9:27] all our children. They would all they
[9:29] would hate us and we would have no
[9:31] relationship with them. Amen.
[9:33] &gt;&gt; We're living in a different age and a
[9:35] different hour. We have to adjust oursel
[9:36] and who knows we may be on the precipice
[9:38] of another time and we have to adjust
[9:40] oursel again. So you have to always
[9:43] you're always examining your motives and
[9:45] objectives. You're examining how am I
[9:48] interacting with other people? How am I
[9:49] speaking to other people? Am I helping
[9:51] them to grow or am I hindering them? Am
[9:55] I holding them back from growing? That's
[9:57] the danger because evil
[10:02] so how do what is what is evil backwards
[10:07] live.
[10:09] So that is that is the it's it's what is
[10:13] the most disadvantageous
[10:16] to life. That's what evil is.
[10:21] So if you think about love, if love is a
[10:23] power force that extends itself for the
[10:26] purpose of spiritual growth, what is
[10:28] evil? It's anything that hinders or
[10:30] stops or blocks spiritual growth in
[10:33] others.
[10:36] Think about it this way.
[10:39] I'm raising I'm raising children and by
[10:42] the time they're 18, they can't cook.
[10:44] They don't know how to do the laundry.
[10:46] They don't know how to operate a bank
[10:48] account. They don't know how to save
[10:49] money and they don't know anything about
[10:52] the message at all. They just been
[10:54] dragged to church. They don't know the
[10:56] reason behind anything.
[10:59] Am I loving them? No. I'm creating
[11:02] people that are dependent on me to
[11:04] function. That isn't love. That's evil.
[11:08] Because we're supposed to grow
[11:09] spiritually. And if we're not creating
[11:12] spiritual growth,
[11:14] especially in oursel and in our family,
[11:18] we're not operating according to love.
[11:19] We're operate operating according to
[11:21] evil. And as I said, what so what's the
[11:25] purpose of hindering spiritual growth in
[11:27] others? It's to protect their own sick
[11:29] selves.
[11:31] That's what evil does. They protect
[11:33] their own skin at all costs. They can
[11:37] never seem to be seen as the one that's
[11:40] mistaken. That's one the one that's in
[11:42] error. The one that needs to be
[11:43] corrected. It always has to have the
[11:46] upper hand and be right. And because of
[11:50] that, it always has to have a scapegoat.
[11:54] &gt;&gt; We can find this through the Bible. And
[11:56] if we get there, we'll talk about it.
[11:58] Now, next thing is it's easy to point at
[12:00] others and say, "You've done evil.
[12:02] You've done evil. You've done evil." But
[12:04] what about me? Because if I've I've
[12:07] absolutely done things that have
[12:08] hindered my children's spiritual growth,
[12:11] I've done evil. The Lord's helped me to
[12:13] repent and I might still be doing it
[12:17] doing evil and I might still have need
[12:19] of repentance. I believe that I do. And
[12:22] we have to understand that and be be
[12:24] humble enough to admit it to ourselves
[12:26] is that we do things to hinder other
[12:28] people.
[12:30] &gt;&gt; But don't just let it continue.
[12:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. The love of God would cause you to
[12:35] repent so that you're not hindering
[12:37] other people from growing spiritually.
[12:43] And again, I'll I'll repeat what I said
[12:45] before. Evil people usually are not
[12:47] aware that they're evil.
[12:50] They think they're normal, average, or
[12:53] probably above average, and that
[12:56] everything they're doing is for the
[12:57] greater good. But they'll never evaluate
[13:00] the fruit of their lives. All around
[13:03] them is confusion, hurt, anger, and
[13:06] pain. But they'll tell you clearly
[13:08] that's their fault. That's their
[13:10] problem. I don't know why they did that.
[13:13] It's always someone else's problem. They
[13:15] can never own their own faults.
[13:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:22] Another illustration
[13:25] would be
[13:27] a pastor that creates reliance on
[13:29] himself. We've all heard the stories. We
[13:32] all we all we've all perhaps even uh
[13:35] lived through it,
[13:36] &gt;&gt; right?
[13:37] &gt;&gt; And I've come out on the other side to
[13:38] tell the story.
[13:40] &gt;&gt; They won't allow anybody to make
[13:42] decisions on their own.
[13:44] You can't you couldn't make a life
[13:46] decision. and you have to ask the pastor
[13:47] for approval for your for all your life
[13:50] decisions. And it's it's all over the
[13:52] place. And it's h it's happened time and
[13:56] time again. There's people sitting here
[13:57] that have been victims of this kind of
[14:00] spiritual abuse
[14:02] &gt;&gt; and they can't make their own decision.
[14:04] Pastor has to give them permission.
[14:07] Why is it evil? It's good to get the
[14:09] opinion of others before you make a
[14:11] decision, right? But this is not that.
[14:14] This is that turned into something evil
[14:17] because true love would help you grow so
[14:20] that you in maturity can make your own
[14:23] decisions following the leadership of
[14:24] the Holy Spirit.
[14:27] Evil, this e this kind of evil hinders
[14:30] spiritual growth. And what does it do?
[14:32] It creates dependency.
[14:35] Love is not dependency.
[14:38] Love always points other people to the
[14:40] source of spiritual growth. And it's not
[14:43] me, it's Christ.
[14:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:46] &gt;&gt; Love is not dependency. If I if I raise
[14:50] my kids in such a way that they can't
[14:52] function without me, that is evil.
[14:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:55] &gt;&gt; And that is hindering their spiritual
[14:58] growth. The function of parents is for
[15:02] the spiritual growth of their children.
[15:06] It's not merely to create relationships.
[15:08] That's part of it. It's to grow them
[15:11] into adults.
[15:13] &gt;&gt; If we can put it in biblical terms, it's
[15:15] to adopt them.
[15:16] &gt;&gt; Bring them to full adoption. Bring them
[15:18] to maturity. So they then can walk in
[15:22] their own spiritual life on their own
[15:24] two feet.
[15:29] &gt;&gt; Love is not dependency.
[15:32] Instead of teaching our sons about
[15:34] finances and working hard, we allow them
[15:36] just to skate along life doing what's
[15:39] easy because otherwise they get angry
[15:41] and frustrated at you and give you
[15:42] trouble. So, let's just let them do the
[15:44] easy thing.
[15:46] That's evil. That's absolutely evil
[15:50] because the love says, "No, you're going
[15:53] the wrong way. You have to be a man. You
[15:54] have to take care of a home. You have to
[15:56] take care of a family. You have to take
[15:58] responsibility."
[16:00] But instead of adopting our sons, we let
[16:02] them be in perpetual boyhood. And that's
[16:05] flatout evil.
[16:08] &gt;&gt; It's our job as parents to establish
[16:13] what it means to live as mature in
[16:16] Christ in their hearts. And that work
[16:19] starts from the time they're little.
[16:21] Doesn't start when they're 13. It has to
[16:23] start long before that.
[16:25] In Eastern culture, you're an adult by
[16:27] the time you're 13.
[16:34] and and evil always blames someone else
[16:38] for what it did. I know I'm repeating
[16:40] these points, but I I want to get it
[16:42] through
[16:44] &gt;&gt; very clear.
[16:46] It will always pass the buck on to
[16:49] someone else.
[16:51] I think I skipped a bunch of screens.
[16:53] Okay. Defining evil. Evil is anything
[16:56] that hinders or stops spiritual growth
[16:58] in order to protect our own sick selves,
[17:02] and it always has a scapegoat.
[17:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:06] &gt;&gt; Genesis 3:9. And the Lord God called
[17:08] unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art
[17:11] thou?
[17:13] And he said, I heard thy voice in the
[17:15] garden, and I was afraid because I was
[17:16] naked and hid myself. And he said, Who
[17:19] told thee thou was naked? Hast thou
[17:22] eaten of the tree whereof I commanded
[17:23] thee thou that thou shouldest not eat?
[17:26] And the man said, the woman whom you
[17:30] gave to be with me, she gave me of the
[17:34] tree and I did eat. Here in this case,
[17:38] there's two scapegoats,
[17:40] the woman and God.
[17:43] Adam instead of taking personal
[17:45] responsibility for his sin passed the
[17:47] buck off to his wife and then ultimately
[17:52] to God himself. It's a flaw in design by
[17:55] the maker.
[17:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:00] &gt;&gt; What about Eve? Did she take personal
[18:02] responsibility?
[18:03] And the Lord God said unto the woman,
[18:05] "What is this that thouast done?" Woman
[18:06] said, "Serpent did it.
[18:08] &gt;&gt; The devil made me do it. serpent
[18:11] beguiled me and I did eat.
[18:18] So let's walk through what is personal
[18:21] responsibility. Who is responsible here?
[18:24] God went to the person responsible
[18:27] first, right? Adam
[18:30] responsibility isn't say saying let's
[18:33] bring this down to our own home.
[18:35] responsibility is saying you know
[18:39] all these years I tried to do my best to
[18:41] raise my kids but you know they turned
[18:44] out like they didn't they had not
[18:45] serving the Lord my wife has always been
[18:48] a problem
[18:50] she's she's never taken the time to
[18:54] teach the girls anything you know see
[18:56] that's that's not true in my home but
[19:00] that would be
[19:02] that would be the picture here bringing
[19:03] it down to our our age is we're going to
[19:05] always blame somebody else.
[19:08] Why did your wife not do it, buddy? Were
[19:11] you teaching your wife?
[19:14] Well, that was the pastor's job. Uh-oh.
[19:18] No, it was your job. You are the head of
[19:20] the home. The only one under above you
[19:24] is Christ. So, you're the king in that
[19:27] home. And you can't just blame someone
[19:30] else for something that happened. You
[19:31] have full responsibility. And when
[19:33] you're called to account for what's
[19:35] happened in your family, God is not
[19:37] going to ask. You might ask your wife
[19:39] second, as in this case, but he ain't
[19:42] going to ask your wife first. You are
[19:44] the one that will be held personally
[19:46] responsible for what is happening in
[19:48] your home. And so live that way. Part of
[19:51] us being part of us being restored back
[19:56] to what everything that Adam lost
[19:59] by the opening of the seven seals is us
[20:02] being able to take responsibility for
[20:05] what's happened.
[20:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:08] &gt;&gt; We we we're wanting to speak and our
[20:11] word is backed, but then if something
[20:13] goes wrong, we want someone else to be
[20:15] responsible.
[20:18] No, that's not how it works. We have to
[20:21] take personal responsibility for the
[20:23] things that happen in our life. If we
[20:26] don't, God looks upon us as being evil.
[20:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:32] &gt;&gt; I won't go through the details. I've
[20:33] referred to the story a number of times.
[20:35] But you see in 1st Samuel 15, Saul is
[20:39] given a command
[20:42] and Samuel is told, "This man has
[20:45] refused to fulfill the word of the Lord.
[20:48] I've because he's rejected me. I've
[20:51] rejected him from being king. So this is
[20:53] the word that Samuel's going to. Samuel
[20:55] comes to Saul. Saul says, "I've com I've
[20:58] performed the commandment of the Lord."
[21:01] Samuel says, "What what in the world is
[21:03] this uh farm animal noise that's going
[21:06] on here that we got?"
[21:10] Well, they've been brought from the
[21:11] Amalachites. The people spared the best
[21:13] of the sheep and of the ox oxen to
[21:16] sacrifice
[21:18] unto the Lord thy God. Oh my, what a
[21:22] religious man.
[21:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:25] &gt;&gt; Using religion as a cloak for his evil.
[21:32] Then Samuel said unto Saul, "I will tell
[21:35] thee what the Lord has said to me this
[21:37] night." And he said unto him, "Say on."
[21:41] And so he goes through that and he tells
[21:43] him, "You didn't obey
[21:46] and you did evil in the sight of the
[21:48] Lord."
[21:51] Saul again argues with the prophet. Yay,
[21:55] I have obeyed the voice of the Lord and
[21:57] I did go and do the way that the Lord
[21:59] sent me and I brought the king back and
[22:02] I destroyed the Amalachites
[22:06] and we're going to offer sacrifices.
[22:09] It's going to be it's going to be a
[22:10] great meeting. We're going to have a
[22:12] great special meetings here. God will be
[22:15] so pleased.
[22:18] &gt;&gt; And and Samuel says, "Does the Lord have
[22:21] a great delight in special meetings as
[22:24] he does in obeying the Lord your God?"
[22:28] Does he? I want to ask everyone that.
[22:32] &gt;&gt; Is that the answer to everything? Or is
[22:34] obeying the word of the Lord the answer
[22:35] to everything? Obeying the word of the
[22:37] Lord is the answer to everything. So
[22:39] what is it? We take personal
[22:41] responsibility for what goes right and
[22:43] goes wrong. As men
[22:45] &gt;&gt; and as women, as dads and as moms, we
[22:47] take responsibility. And then once we
[22:49] take responsibility, we go forward and
[22:51] do what we must do to teach and instruct
[22:55] and lead in our homes and in our
[22:57] families. And if our wife must be
[22:59] corrected, we must correct her. And if
[23:02] our children must be corrected, we have
[23:04] the difficult conversations and we make
[23:06] the stands and we bring the consequences
[23:09] and we do what we have to do to restore
[23:12] order in our homes and families.
[23:17] &gt;&gt; And the first thing that you have to do
[23:18] to restore order in homes and families
[23:21] is restore the heart connection between
[23:24] you and your family. It's not with rules
[23:28] and with with might and with power. Yes,
[23:31] there's times where you have to do that.
[23:33] But without the heart connection between
[23:35] you and your family, what will it be?
[23:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:39] &gt;&gt; True.
[23:39] &gt;&gt; A fight.
[23:41] &gt;&gt; It will be very difficult. It'll be
[23:43] difficult even with a heart connection.
[23:47] &gt;&gt; To reestablish order in the home, it
[23:50] will be. But without a heart connection,
[23:52] you might as well forget it. We go about
[23:54] it the wrong way. We We start it the
[23:56] wrong way. We try to try to fix it the
[23:59] wrong way. and we try to maintain it the
[24:01] wrong way
[24:03] &gt;&gt; without really being connected to the
[24:06] hearts of our family. We can't that's
[24:08] the that's rule 101 in teaching. If
[24:10] you're not connected to the people's
[24:12] hearts and there's not a respect and an
[24:14] honor between you in your lives, they
[24:17] can't learn anything.
[24:20] &gt;&gt; And it starts with how you treat one
[24:22] another. If you're not going to hon be
[24:24] be honorable towards your family,
[24:26] towards your wife, they're not going to
[24:27] honor you back. Amen.
[24:29] &gt;&gt; True.
[24:30] &gt;&gt; And your wife, if you're not sisters, if
[24:32] you're not going to honor your daughters
[24:34] and treat them with honor and respect,
[24:38] if you're going to yell at them and
[24:39] scream at them, guess what you're going
[24:41] to get when they're teenagers? Yelling
[24:43] and screaming teenagers.
[24:46] And so it's it to to fix it, it's it's
[24:50] hard. It's difficult. But we have to
[24:52] remember it's a relationship.
[24:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:55] rules without relationship brings
[24:58] rebellion.
[25:01] &gt;&gt; I have no idea where I am. Nowhere near
[25:03] my notes.
[25:05] &gt;&gt; But we have to understand this is
[25:07] there's many problems. I have problems.
[25:10] I've made horrible mistakes that have
[25:13] caused disasters in my family. But the
[25:16] grace of God has woken me up in the
[25:18] middle of the night to correct me
[25:19] sometimes.
[25:21] &gt;&gt; And then what do I have to do? I have to
[25:23] take action. But we also have to
[25:25] remember you can take action uh like a
[25:28] fanatic.
[25:30] We've all met people that are like that
[25:32] and you talk to them for 10 minutes and
[25:34] you know there's a whole lot of crazy
[25:36] going on
[25:39] &gt;&gt; and they're so zealous for the word of
[25:41] God. They'll let you know that you're an
[25:42] unbeliever and everyone else in the
[25:44] entire planet is an unbeliever besides
[25:46] them and whoever agrees with them.
[25:49] No, we're not talking about being
[25:51] fanatical about it. We're talking about
[25:54] loving well. We're talking about
[25:57] understanding that that part of
[25:58] spiritual love is a heart connection
[26:00] that the person has felt that you
[26:03] actually care about them. Now, of
[26:06] course, we understand that can all be
[26:08] perverted. We're not suggesting that
[26:10] it's all sunshine and rainbows in this
[26:14] connection of hearts because it's like
[26:16] sometimes you have to say hard things.
[26:19] Sometimes you have to say difficult
[26:20] things. In fact, love demands it. If we
[26:23] don't say the difficult things and hard
[26:25] things, it's we're not aiming for their
[26:28] spiritual growth. We might be aiming for
[26:31] a good feeling, but we're not aiming for
[26:33] spiritual growth. Again, as Christians,
[26:36] we're not aiming for felio love, sto
[26:44] experience. We're aiming for agape. This
[26:46] is the love that's called, God has
[26:48] called us to.
[26:52] My goodness. I'm just going to close
[26:54] there because I'm so far off my notes
[26:56] and to get back it's going to take about
[26:58] 15 minutes. So, let's pray.
[27:01] Heavenly Father, we just come before
[27:02] you, Lord, and we want to commit this
[27:04] word into your hands. Father, I I was
[27:07] all mixed up with it and all over the
[27:09] place and repeating myself, Lord, but
[27:12] believe it was even through my
[27:17] uh leaving my notes so badly, I believe
[27:20] that you're you were directing things
[27:21] and you were speaking things into
[27:23] people's lives, Father. Maybe speaking
[27:25] things into my own life, Father. So, we
[27:28] thank you for that. We commit ourselves
[27:30] to you for your glory. We ask in Jesus
[27:32] name. Amen.
