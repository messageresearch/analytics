him a hand this morning lord we love you all hail king jesus we're here to serve him today we're here to be instructed by him i hope that's why you're here that's why i'm here amen i from the earliest dawn's early light before dawn's early light sitting in a dark room in my living room just saying lord just a complete surrender that's all that matters it's all that counts we're in such a time as this friends with light blending with darkness and such a dismal murky that you can't if you don't have the compass if you don't have a spirit that's ready and calibrated and in tune with god you're gonna get lost you'll never find your way there's just such it's too easy to go off track it's such a blending of light and darkness it's it's the greatest time of darkness covers the whole earth and darkness and gross darkness on the people it didn't even say that in the days of noah [Music] didn't even say that in the days of lot and you are in the convergence of those two days you've got you're double teamed by the days of noah and the days of lot darkness covering the earth this is all the way back to the chaos before in genesis before god began to speak and i'll tell you something by the same power god said let there be light and found the seed through that darkness drove that darkness back brought seed to life that's you here you are in the darkness again but the same word that says let there be light amen and it it it didn't matter what darkness you were in and how thick it was it was rebuked it was scattered it was set to its places and light struck the seed of god in you and today you stand alive in christ so it's uh the darkest day but yet the brightest day arise shine thy not there thy light has come amen praise the name of the lord we want to invite you to romans 7 this morning great to all in the name of the lord greetings to streaming audience and amen i sure just want to just say a word of appreciation to the to the many words of encouragement i receive amen from friends all over the world and it's just always such a shot in the arm amen romans 7 we're just going to read a few verses beginning at verse 4. so no i wanted my title screen please i have my text embedded in the powerpoint amen so take that down please bradley and stick up my powerpoint please amen we'll give you a minute to make that adjustment amen i want to continue today um with consequences under the order of melchizedek this will be part two i really enjoyed preaching that last sunday and i had some wonderful comments and feedback from you and people abroad and so we're just thanking the lord for that and so um let's see i will uh hmm i think maybe i'll do it let me see here is this that's not the one oh this is it ah some fiend has stolen my receiver you got it no wow okay whoever's guilty we're going to be killing you amen all right brother brad you'll have to you'll have to control it from there thank you buddy amen so we want to look here and this is where we were last time now as you can see i've changed the subtitle to the results of opening the seven seals now i'm going to read the verses four i think through six um from the king james and then i want to go back again to that oh yes four through six in the king james and then i want to read from that other translation that i'm really enjoying so let's read together slide one brother brad all right here we go wherefore now watch what's paul instructing here wherefore my brethren ye also are become dead to the law by the body of christ that ye should be married to another even to him who is raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto god verse 5. for when we were in the flesh the motions of sin which were by the law did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death verse 6 but now now everybody say but now but now we are delivered from the law that being dead wherein we were held that we should serve in newness of spirit and not in the oldness of the letter now before we switch to the next slide let's pray father we thank you for your word today and i completely surrender myself into your care now you know the desire of my heart lord and i meant it quite sincerely i want you to take the material and deliver it today as you see fit lord i have found that that is the most productive way if i can just get out of the way shut up and let you be the preacher grant it lord i commit it to you and commit myself to this end in jesus name amen god bless you as you're seated and now we're going to take the next slide and we're going to go back to the the the alternate translation all right paul's saying so this is the point that's a great way to start it isn't it so this is the point death ended your relation to the law because i'm glad there's a because because you died to its power when you died with christ on the cross and now everybody say and now you have a spiritual union with christ who was raised from the dead and you with him as a result all right so my subtitle is the result of opening of the seven seals as a result you can reproduce the full life of christ i love that as a result of what he did now you have the ability now you actually can if you humble yourself to it reproduce the life reproduce the full life of god now i can tell you that is the last thing in the world satan wants you to do he already took a thrashing when he only had to fight one jesus if he has to fight thousands more who are who are also reproducing the full life of god he's got no answer for that he don't have enough demons he couldn't knock the lord off in his day and now that christ lives in you this is how this is how and only how you as the bride are an invincible army all right now next slide for when we were controlled by the sinful man boy we're going to amen this one for when we were controlled by the sinful nature the sinful passions and appetites aroused by the law were at work in our bodies and how so that we bore fruit unto death man oh man amen i don't want to hear about your fruit i'm going to tell you mine but we all were bearing fruit unto death look at the next one but now by say but now but now that we have died with christ the law wherein we were held fast has lost its hold upon us so that we are no longer in the old bondage of the letter but in the new service of the spirit blessed be the name of the lord now we were just hold right there brother brad and i'll give you the high sign when to go to the next one so so we we were talking about last time how that what was important and here's where we finished off last time where brother branham talks about how that just the same way that the evil spirited church you remember from the laodicean church age just as that evil spirited church full of iniquity is revealed at the end time or in other words she's made manifest at the end time that it was that little mustard seed that started all those centuries ago that looked harmless see and that it actually grew into a tree where lodge the fowls are the demons of the air people don't get that people don't all people do not pay enough attention to sowing seeds of discrepancy everything you do is a seed everything you think and say and do is a seed and so we should paul said think on things that are lovely think on things that are a good report control your thinking you are in a day that is going to require supreme thought control to not buy into the lie of laodicea which is a homogenation hybridization amalgamation uh all this blending of light and darkness and compromising on the word don't fall for it god is only going to take a perfect people in the rapture now there's no way physically for you to get to perfection you can get to maturity and you're expected to but there is the beauty of what we found brother branham going on to say just as that as that antichrist that evil spirited church has become made manifest and i want to make a point because that's a big point when we talk about revelation okay let me just give you a for instance so when we look at paul's day and paul's ministry now contrast paul's day to our day now you'll find and this is provable in the bible that there is not any doctrine not a single teaching that william branham brought that is not founded on what paul taught so this day was a restoration of that day you understand say but but aren't we to go further so you've got to be careful how you interpret further revelation so revelation as it would relate to paul's understanding of the mystery of god your brother branham's brother branham's understanding as elijah would not exceed paul's understanding but it is true that in manifestation this last day church becomes more of a manifested reality of the revelation than the first age who fell away amen so that first age was running and tracking along for the first couple of decades until they started to get relaxed and started to backslide this age picks up by the restoration of the original word which was the the the mighty god unveiled the the word of god was not sealed to paul not at all the seven seals came on the book because christ couldn't come for a church she backslid and so he binds it up in seven seals to live to run out through seven ages and sits back down to intercede instead of coming for his church you understand but in the end time he promised i'm going to unseal it back again and i'm going to restore the original faith of the fathers and then that will bring a bride out of the age of the church who has kicked christ out who is no longer his mouthpiece who has become her own mouthpiece and therefore god has called a bride out of a church a church out of a church you understand and has sent down has unsealed now when he unsealed the seven seals you're seeing a symbol you're seeing a book you're seeing a book in the hand of him and it's sealed and christ takes it and unseals it but you but you but we've come to understand that and brother branham is the first one to call that a book of redemption he titles it that the bible calls it a seven sealed book brother adam says the book of redemption because it's all the family of god and all the mystery of god because and and therefore we find then that the that the book is the bible particularly the new testament that's why jesus would say this is my blood in the new testament because it's his life it's the holy ghost when he uns that's why brother brandon would say when he un when he broke the seals he didn't break them off of a figurative book brother branham said he broke them off of himself amen and another place he says brother brahm says christ broke the seals out of himself so what was it the the breaking of the seventh seal was the opening of the word the revealing of the mighty god the unveiling of god in the word hallelujah and then christ according to revelation 10 takes that open book that opened word that all all the mysteries now unveiled back to the faith of the fathers and gives it to a messenger with strict instructions to tell the people to eat it because they'll eat it they'll become it and you're eating your way to a body change because that's the result of the unsealing of seven seals so today we have access back to the mind of god and that's the only access there is no access back to god through a sealed word for the token every age received the god always made sure he got his family into the first resurrection condition but you have to understand that that what they had was a dip under partial light but we now have the return of what paul had the jubilee the abstract which searches the history all the way back to the mind of god that that's why that's why you can go into the old testament and in genesis you find you don't find a perfect abraham you find a liar twice over a cheater uh bringing forth children after fl after the flesh after desires you understand and so lying and conniving his way to pharaoh into the to the philistine king but but but by the time you get over to the book of hebrews all of that record has been expunged amen it's not recorded say god was being courteous no no he recorded everything in existence that no longer existed you understand the abstract searches it all the way back to the mind of god it doesn't just go back to what abraham did and go okay we're just gonna i'm just gonna forgive you for this and we're not gonna hold it against you no it goes on back past the failure of abraham all the way back to the mind of god and in the mind of god abraham never did do those things so the abstract searches it all the way back and that's what happened in this day when a prophet said now the abstract is returned to the church and it searched you all the way back to the mind of god and a prophet could say you actually never sinned in the first place because your first place was in him so the record is not it's not just that he was found not guilty it's not you say well he was found innocent it's not even just that it was expunged judicially that it takes a judge to do that when a judge judicially expunges your record it even removes the record that you were ever even charged it removes the indictment it removes the charge it removes all history as if you never did it in the first place this is the result of seven seals being broken and christ being revealed to the bride and sent down to you and you're eating upon your perfection and therefore because of your faith in it like abraham god imputes perfection to you [Applause] and you stand today not just forgiven but completely exonerated as if you never ever did it there's no record of anything you ever did under the blood of jesus so hebrews 11 wasn't omitting hebrews 11 was only recording everything in existence and the only thing in the existence that remained after god got finished after jesus said this is my blood in the new testament once paul came under once paul comes under that and writes about abraham in the hall of fame the only thing left after expungement was abraham staggered not of the promise it only expunged the bad it left the perfect oh hallelujah friends and so we found brother branham last time we found him saying that this this bride church as she matures her ripenesses and identification with her lord catch it now by means of the word not because you checked all the boxes or got an a on your report card but by means of the word by means of your faith that's how powerful the unsealed book is it has the ability to completely in the even standing here in real time i already look perfect to god amen say what about my sins he don't see him do you know the only thing he sees my faith in his word my faith in his word that's all he sees that's all he hears my faith in his word as far as as far as a human record he looks at christ and christ certainly lived the perceptive perceptive side of the word on my behalf he never made a mistake and so when god looks at you he says you never made a mistake that's what your faith in this unsealed book does say that's a lot that's only the start what it will eventually do is change you at the atomic level and there is not enough devils in hell to stop it if the devil can't make you disbelieve his word he can't stop your body change understand that your failures will never stop it if the devil can't stop your faith in the word he can never stop your body being changed because the faith the word that faith you have in the word you have is pregnanted itself with changing power and you are taking in by by this by partaking of this word of this end time you are you have passed from death unto life and you are eating your way to a body change see and that's why brother branham we we ended it last time when he says then as she nears the headstone and i emphasize this becoming like him through the word jesus will come that the bride and groom may be for every united as one and so i i i'm i'm not here perfect as paul said i don't count myself to have apprehended it all yet see but here's what i do i'm becoming i'm pressing why are you pressing because i'm becoming and when i cross the finish line i'm going to be in a dead run a sprint i say why are you running because i'm becoming hallelujah i'm not going to stagger across the line nothing doing i'm going to be running full steam when i cross that line hallelujah because that's the only life worth living so we allow one of the last things we said you last sunday we talk about the consequences under the order of melchizedek if it wasn't for this restoration of melchizedek paul said i got a lot to tell you but see the church was already getting dull they were already the disciples are already having to sit under oil lamps and write to the church you need to earnestly contend for the faith once delivered come on you know they were already drifting even while the disciples were alive gnosticism was already taking root they were already looking at christ in a weird way and and john has to write listen let me make it clear whoever doesn't confess that jesus christ came in the flesh is antichrist dot period who do you think he's talking to gnostics unbelievers running around even while william branham was alive wasn't and trying trying to change the doctrines today they try to change they claim they're in the message they're not in the message they're not in the message i don't care what they claim when you're living a life that's contrary to the word that restored you're not in the message the message is the revealed word and when you take a part of the revealed word and say it's not applying anymore you're out of the message i don't care who you are what your surname is i don't care what country you're living or what city or what heritage or how long you've been a been carrying message books when you deny the word of god when you deny the restored word you're not in the message you're you're you're you're you're a sidetrack of it see i'm not even suggesting you're lost i'm just simply saying you're not in the mainstream of the message god knows those that are his and sometimes even god's family gets trapped up in misinterpreted theology god won't lose them find word about it see but i just want to make that clear you're definitely not in the message you do not represent the teachings of william branham when you change the bible that's it say it again listen out over the airwaves you are not representing the message of william branham when you change the bible when you try to do away with ephesians chapter four and the fivefold ministry you are out of the bible you are not in the message you do not represent william branham you represent yourself see so this message came to turn our hearts back to the faith of our fathers and that's why brother branham would stand on the other side and say i only ever preached what paul preached but we acknowledge that there is yet manifestations that we are coming to have come to and will come to that that early church couldn't because they fell away and that was all in the plan of god that wasn't satan sucker punching god i'll promise you that was all in the plan of god but we find out friends that i mean if i just tell somebody look if you have a hard time with that aspect that we're to produce more by in other words not revelation as in understanding but revelation as in manifesting becoming the word then then that church didn't take a body change you will so if you can't see that principle in any other way just see it there that church did not take a body change but you will there will be a people on the earth who are alive and remain at the coming of the lord i'm glad today i am alive and remain [Music] the devil took his best shot missed angels interdicted kept me here i figure i'm on grace time now i figure every moment since i already shouldn't be here i'm just going to live on grace hallelujah i should have already been gone but god kept me here therefore what am i going to be afraid of i'm not afraid of nothing i already shouldn't be here but i am here and therefore i'm going to carry on and preach the gospel amen and so we found that we are becoming and that's really what matters because then then then then the consequences of melchizedek this mystery of melchizedek that why brother bradham felt the need to bring it was because that was the model that every son and daughter of god is going to come to the word made flesh that's that and that's why brother branham would go back to that visit when he would stand in a prayer line and he would say now he had his back to attend to to to sarah and he said i'll turn my back to the audience and he duplicated that sign he was joining that sign to this hour paul tried to do it in his day and he couldn't he said i got a lot to tell you but you're already dull of hearing but this bride is predestinated not to fall not to be deceived and she's hearing and living the consequences the result of calvary the result of seven seals the result of the son of man the result of melchizedek this is what makes her unstoppable amen so that means because that all of that is true then i get to live a different set of consequences than the ones i created and that is the beauty of it because there's consequences with everything everything you do has a consequence and if i today had to think about my future that i've got all kinds of consequences laying in my path for things that i did in sin i'm going to tell you i'm going to be walking around in fear i'm going to be walking around apprehensive i'm going to be afraid to jump step move i won't know whether to come here or sick them i won't know what to do but today because of that day on calvary what a resurrection that was and because of today what a resurrection this is that we've come up out of cold formal denominationalism to be a part of the living god then i don't have to live the consequences i created i get to live a whole new set of consequences based only on one thing i believe the word and i tried my best because now i've got a fighting chance because now i'm no longer married to the law married to christ so now i actually have a chance to be all i can be before you even had no chance so so we find then that that i am becoming brother branham says here all right brother brad let's go to the next slide should be i think slide seven probably so ah stand by i might be have a mix up here all right i do have but uh it's okay okay now yes i see what i did wrong okay let me let me fix something stand by everybody good just breathe you'll be okay just calm down all right okay brother brad go to slide 12 and we should have it okay that's the one thank you sir all right so brother branham says here the bible said there is one god not three amen you believe it you can't get this straightened out and have three gods you would never sell a jew that i'll tell you that one who knows better he knows there's only one god notice like the sculpture he hides with a mask over it that's what god has done to this age next slide it's been hid all these things has been hid and is supposed to be revealed in this age now the bible says they will be revealed in the latter times all right now now now all right now let me make a point okay so if you in certain quotes like this it looks like that the that the mystery of god that the seven sealed book has been sealed since the dawn of time and it can look like that and understand you there again we gotta watch the difference between a revelation of understanding and a revelation of manifestation yes what this bride is becoming today has been sealed since the dawn of time satan has had ideas of what it of what god was after god shows the pattern in the book of genesis but we realize that the word of god was not sealed to paul so you have to acknowledge that paul had the mystery otherwise why are we restored what are we restored back to a partial understanding say well yes but then brother branham got more well that's not scriptural there's no there's no prophecy that tells me an elijah would come with greater revelation what i every scripture tells me is he'd restore me back but it is true that the manifestation side of it has been sealed up and it's been a mystery and and this is why satan can't stop it has never been able to stop it and can't stop you and won't stop you and you're going in a rapture and you can't stop it see so he says it's like a sculptor's keeping his piece of work all covered over until the time he takes the mask off of it and there it is in other words once he takes the cover off it's already built by the time satan figures out how i'm going to get changed i'm gone remember brother rem said and taught us just when they think they've got to shut up then we just go up amen see all right next slide and that's what the bible has been it has been a work of god that's been covered up see and it's been hid since the foundation of the world and it's seven-fold mystery see those seven spirits of god had to live out through the ages for the mystery to unfold it's not a lack of understanding in paul's day but it's a lack of manifestation it has to go brother brown said that early church had to die because that corn of wheat had to go into the ground it had to come back out in stages and now we're at this time and there ain't no more ages there ain't no more stages the next thing happens to this bride is a body change and she's caught away we don't need another revelation there's not another revival coming the next revival is to israel you're in the bride's revival it's happening right now i know the world looks crazy you might feel as unspiritual as a bump on a log not on a logger but i'm here to tell you you're in a revival as i said you last week if you're laying back on the comfort of carnality get up get up get up go forward go forward this is no time to be relaxed it's time for earnest sincerity and god promised in this day at the age of this laodicean church he would take the mask off the whole thing and we could see it what a glorious thing what are glorious i want you to look at those last word four words what a glorious thing say oh what's glorious me you that's what he's talking about the sculptor has had a covering over the perfection he's bringing in the bride but at the last day he he unveils himself she takes the book eats the book is transformed she's now in the image of christ she is him the the cover's been thrown off and the devil's looking at you going how did you get to be this why are you not out there with the rest of the world because i've eaten the book hallelujah i've become the book hallelujah i've i've been made manifest what a glorious thing you me you're the sculpture you're the thing he's been building since the dawn since the foundation of the world he already built christ that's why brother brandon said in christ is the mystery the threefold plan he says in this way the entire bible genesis of revelation is one goal amen amen one and he says and a little bit here we're going to see what that one goal is and when he begins to bring it all forward he takes us right to the answer expression it's all been about god expressing himself in a family so god doesn't just create a family god doesn't just materialize a bride in front of him because if he did it that way she'd have a start date and a shelf life see brother branham said you can't annihilate anything you take a piece of paper and say i'll burn it he said you haven't annihilated it all you did was turn it back to its original gases he said if time would go on long enough he said that those gases could become a tree again and get manufactured into paper again you can't annihilate anything only god can do it whatever god put together at the molecular level he can just take it apart you understand and so so so now we find that he created hell hell had a start time hell has a shelf life you understand it has an ending date an expiration date and we find out that that's that that's not that's not what god was ever intending god doesn't just create a bride out in front of him because then she would she if time would go on long enough she could come to an end he'd be alone again have to start over rather than creating a family god became a family god expressing himself through all time space and eternity expressed in earth expressed a universe for this family to be priests and kings in hallelujah so you understand that that this is why you're just as eternal as him you're just as much a part of the word as him he can't lose you lest he lose himself you can't not believe because you don't have a choice there's something inside you that overrules you it even goes beyond your understanding even when you see things and hear things you don't understand and i cannot answer it for you you come away and say well i'm still a believer so what about this well i don't know but i know about this i don't know about that i don't know about that but i know about this i am a believer and i can't be otherwise i'm sorry well you're a miserable failure that might be but i'm a believer hallelujah i am marching to zion i am a part of god i do recognize it and i can't help myself so what am i looking at what is this glorious thing is you it's it's me not the guy you see in the mirror in the bathroom not that guy that that that why do you think they call that a vanity i didn't talk about that i'm not talking about that i'm talking about this mirror god is not looking in that mirror god's looking in this mirror and says you're perfect i see no fault in you you believe my word it's accounted to you for righteousness how much righteousness do i get everything christ accomplished goes to you hallelujah what about all my sins god took all of yours and put them on christ and he paid the price for you he went to hell and god judged him as a sinner and sent him to hell he who knew no sin became sin was sent to hell why why why so i don't ever have to go [Applause] hallelujah oh my see so it's not about that man in the mirror in your bathroom that guy's full of sin that's the worst trouble you got see the real me is at war with that man the real you is at war with that guy see and so what so we find then that that it's a glorious thing because the lord is looking at the same mirror of his word and the book of hebrews proves that as we dealt with abraham's failures previously it ex it didn't just find him innocent it expunged his record so fortunately the lord's looking in that same mirror amen amen praise the lord so it's not a doctrinal understanding in the word see because paul already had that see but it's a it's a manifestation in the bride body it's never been seen at this level see never been seen at this level no one say well how is that so because no one has ever had to wade through this much unbelief before you are living in the convergence of everything under the white horse everything under the red horse everything under the black horse you're living under the convergence of everything of babylon and everything of persia and everything of greece and everything of rome you're living under the combined forces of everything in noah's day and everything in lot's day 200 million special demon chargers have been released from euphrates to do what they drove the jews back to the homeland but when that job was over 80 70 80 how many years ago what did what did those guys do they turned and came after you they were already hot on our on our heels before the seals were even open but god was able to preserve even that bride even before the seals imagine what you have now imagine how helpless the devil is stopping you he owns the government he owns the education system he owns all the schools he owns all the social fabric he owns the entertainment he owns everything but yet and it burns him he's got all the churches all the pulpits all the people but it burns him that he don't have that little tiny group scattered around the world hallelujah i'm happy to be a burn to him i'm happy to be a thorn in his side amen i'm happy that i stop letting stop letting him threaten you remind him that he can't even ride his last horse until i'm gone amen satan i don't care who you want in the white house you ain't going to get control till i'm out of here china north korea i don't care russia i don't care i i am satan look me in the eye lucifer i'm stopping you i'm stopping you so how you stopping because i got the holy ghost in me and he can't ride till the holy ghost is gone hallelujah oh my no wonder we could say today what a glorious thing i want you to i want you to think about yourself as a believer and just say what a glorious thing uh we're not glorying in our failures i'm glorying in his victory that regardless of my failures his victory is not upended next slide i think probably slide 15. now we read over here in revelation the 13th chapter the eighth verse that the beast that comes upon the earth in these last days will deceive all those people on the earth whose names were not written in the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world next frame think of it before jesus was ever born 4 000 years before he come on the earth and several thousand years before you come on the earth jesus in god's mind died for the sins of the world and the book of life was made and your name was put on that book of life before the foundation of the world next slide that's the bible truth see your name was ordained of god and placed on the book of life before the foundation of the world you were there in his attributes you don't remember it no because you're just a part of his life you are a part of god when you become a son or daughter of god next slide just as you are a part of your earthly father that's right you are the male carries the hemoglobin the blood and when that when that has gone in the egg then you become a part of your father and your mother is a part of your father also so you're all part of your father glory that lets the denomination out all together certainly does god in all the only place so you can see why that would let out every denomination because because the only access now to the unveiling of god is thus saith the lord and this is what the seven seals restored to the church thus saith the lord you understand because the problem is without that you'll always lean to your tradition and that's what the church has been built brother jason demars has taught us that so clearly on teaching on the trinity doctrine how it was a a cumulative derived worked on you know and i forget the first several or a couple or several hundred years was it brother jd the holy ghost wasn't even included in the trinity that correct wasn't even included they added him later oh you know we better put the holy ghost in there too really and it's just become more and more babylonian is all it is it's all it is that that's the question i i ask our our you know our mega church on on the radio spouting his nonsense things he's saying going to suffer for in the regions beyond and saying that william branham was in hell because he doesn't accept the trinity and i called him up and said he certainly does accept the trinity just not the catholic version he certainly believes in the trinity the trinity of god one god in three offices god in multiple manifestations just like brother branham says his daughter becky you know when when they're doing the play at jeff high which they used to do that all the time i used to sit in in the auditorium and watch those same plays and and that's where my sister attended high school and and she was doing they were doing the play of carmen and and brother branham says that one actor played two or three different roles one time he'd come out as a hero one time he'd come out as a villain next time he come out is another villain next time he and he just all he did was saying god just went back and changed his outfit changed his mask put on different clothes and came back out and played a whole new role and he said that's what god did in christ that's what god did in melchizedek that's what he that's what he did in ezekiel and isaiah and david that's what he did in malachi that's what he's doing in paul that's what he's doing in you he's just playing another role hallelujah and so we find that that that that i said he certainly believes in the trinity he just doesn't believe the catholic version of the trinity and so and that's why you you can't even come anymore there's no way to get redemption believing that there's no way to get redemption in that false baptism there was a time when god would wink at that but no longer he now requires every man to repent and come to the knowledge of the truth and so that's why the church is no longer his mouthpiece she's her own mouthpiece he she kicked christ out the bride came out with him and now she has thus saith the lord that's the only access to re being redeemed thus saith the lord because every man i don't care how good of a preacher he is how good of a reformer he is he he'll add his own thinking a prophet is unique he has specifically designed and engineered by god that is just like this microphone this microphone has no ability to project words unless i speak into it and all it's doing is transmitting my words through electronic speakers into you but it can't tell you anything it has no mind of its own that's what that's the advantage of a prophet that when he comes he's he's not coming with i think that's what it is or this might be what it is you know you shouldn't do this you shouldn't do that a prophet has thus saith the lord and that alone gives you access to eternal life even if it wasn't william branham you better get busy finding who it is because that's the only way god he says i will do nothing i won't restore the church i won't take her in a rapture i won't do anything until i reveal it to my servants the prophets so we find then that we have been restored to thus saith the lord all right now next next one 19 i think when abraham met him all right now watch this is who we really are and who will really be when abraham met him he was melchizedek he unfolds here what all the attributes remember you're the attributes will do in the final end every son of abraham every son of the faith will absolutely do the same thing but i want you to watch how we have to come now he goes on explaining how you bypass it the often and come straight from the thoughts of god to flesh and and and and so but then you return back if you die before the rapture you go into a theophany body if you're alive and remain that theophany comes in the rapture that theophany leaves come picks up the body that's why when i put brother eddie in the ground i i said to my family i said to sister mom i said mom listen darling we're only we're only storing him this this i'm just storing his temple that's this isn't him i'm just storing his temple and he'll be back here and and when it when the trumpet sounds he'll come right back here he'll find it right where we put it and it'll resurrect it'll become glorified he won't be 80 anymore he'll be 18 or 19. i'll tell you heaven's going to be the biggest youth meeting you've ever attended what a youth camp hallelujah oh my joy unspeakable and full of glory and so so that that that's all that's happening if you're alive and remain you take your body to that theophany and then it's glorified it's changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye see and so so we find that every son so who we really are and who will really be i i am a son of abraham and i am coming under the order of melchizedek what is the order of melchizedek the word made flesh god tabernacling in human form you understand so so now we we we go to the next slide what is possible in these dying bodies brother jason let's be real we are still dying all right a sick person laying dying nothing left but death that's all can happen i've seen a shadows of people don't eat up with cancer and tuberculosis and see them persons a little while after that perfectly normal and strong if there's no divine healing then there's no resurrection because divine healing is the earnest of the resurrection amen so you understand even if you get sick even if even if you're at death's door god can still overrule and bring you right back look at the next one what if death takes me 800 years later on mount transfiguration here stood those two men moses's body had been rotten for hundreds of years but here he was in such a form till even peter james and john recognized him amen if this earthly tabernacle be dissolved if you're an attribute of god expressed here on earth you've got a body waiting here after you leave this world so you know what i say friends it just don't matter what this life is or what satan does it don't matter he don't matter only this matters my faith in this is all that matters nothing else matters this is why we shouldn't be afraid of the world or stressed out over life this is why we should never have schisms and and arguments and funny feelings and and and and let things happen between believers my goodness you're born again amen what are you doing carrying an attitude you're going to heaven what are you upset about oh i hurt my feelings so what guess what they're going to heaven too and their offense and your your hurt feelings ain't gonna stop either of you oh for goodness sake there's always gonna be disputable matters we're human beings but come on friends we're all for one and one for all we're all in this thing together and we're all marching to zion so a lot of times i find it necessary to say to even a believer hey get over yourself you know look in this mirror one time this will tell you how to act how to think how to do how to react and the reaction is what usually gets us in trouble anyway this is the time where brother branham said this day this scripture the sign of sodom say the sign of sodom is great but there's also the sign of the supersede understand that friends you are the super seed you're the super sign we're not chasing some other revival we're not chasing preachers right chasing men i'm here to tell you the kingdom building in this message the bride is done with that she's done with that people who are still pursuing that aren't even in the message this message exalts the lord jesus christ and him alone hallelujah so we find that our record is expunged the abstract searched our history all the way back it didn't need to search back all of my failures it just jumped it all and went back to the mind of god and said what's the record there perfection okay that's what we're going to write about him perfection so what about all this that don't even exist anymore because that was never part of the original vision so we find then friends that the world though it is in a chaos and it is that's my last slide brother brad you can take that down the world is in a chaos but that's not new god handled that in genesis i promise we can handle this again he's been there done that he understands how to settle chaos he understands how to separate light from darkness he understands how to lift his people up in faith he understands how to get you past fear he understands how how to god understands how to heal you god understands that he can take one child and heal him it with a miracle because that that child has nothing to learn this is just a trick of the devil and god's not gonna put up with it another child has got some lessons he needs to learn and that's why the things on him in the first place and god's gonna heal him if he'll just keep walking and not faint just keep going and learn the lesson and then god will heal him sometimes people come up to the altar for the holy ghost and god will give him the holy ghost on the spot boom bang filled up done finished you're off to glory and then somebody else has to come and cry and moan and go weeks and months and sometimes years and you say well is god respective persons no but he's a wise heavenly father he knows if he gives this one the new birth right away this one go forward he'll never look back he'll run for he'll run for he'll be running for his life running pressing toward the mark of the high calling forever over here he knows this guy's still got some issues he knows this guy is still ain't full surrendered so he's going to make him wait and i promise you he can wait you out and if you get going too slow he'll narrow your path and you'll speed up he'll get you where he needs to get you but he's always his words are always true and his ways are always just do you believe that friends a lot of times our life we don't realize is more about stewardship than it is ownership [Music] you just need to realize that i was preaching along those lines wednesday night i i hope that was a blessing to you it was sure a blessing to me to preach it i was just being transparent telling you some things out of my own heart things that the lord taught me in a deep trial and and i i don't ever want to have to go and learn all that again see but calvary has made all this possible see so what an easter that was what a resurrection that was and what a resurrection this is an understanding of the word see that's the understanding of the word's not in question it's a divine declaration it's thus saith the lord we have the devil's answer before he even has the question the purchasing work of calvary and the claiming work in revelation 10 brings this bride to the full perfection of god's kingdom saints of priests and kings i'm glad to be in that number i hope that you understand that you know you you that this nature change that paul spoke about in our opening text in romans 7 that that you have to have this nature change and that nature change is what sets you free to try to live right and and actually have a fighting chance to live the only life that counts his that's what paul is saying to you in romans 7. before the word of god came you don't even have a chance you're just a prisoner to your fallen nature see now you're still in a fallen body even when you're born again but now the inside man his desires are different now now he's fighting that guy the guy in this mirror fights the guy in your bathroom mirror see this guy wants domination that guy wants domination see and you got to decide to take the way with the lord's despised few and press toward the mark press toward that prize let me say to you today in this age i mean you're already impossible you're already you're living in an age impossible it's impossible to be an overcomer there's no way it's too dark there's too much unbelief that satan has too much control he's had a zenith he this is satan's eden you don't stand a chance only by the revealed word of this hour to give you a nature change and then guide you through life do you have even a fighting chance and so brother branham says he says it this way then the one that left home i love that word that's what you find out see you find out that you're the one who left home i only left home say why does that matter because i got failures but i look at my failures and i just go well i only left home and i i regret that i repent for that but that ain't going to hinder me i only left home that's how i got here i didn't bring me here i left home god put me here i came from god i go back to god see there's nothing that can stop that and so we find that the bride she is the final interpretation of the promise to the last day people that's what proverbs 4 18 says but the path of the just is as a shining light that shineth more and more unto the perfect day there's where we are we're shining a light god get it get this understanding clear god has already secured you you are signed sealed and delivered already in heavenly places in christ jesus because of that day on calvary his purchasing work and what he did by claiming the book and losing the seals sending it down to a messenger who gave it to you and you fed on it and you've believed it and here you are amen i just say blessed be the name of the lord let's stand god bless you amen oh brother anthony you're gonna have to come up here and sing that jubilee for me uh blessed be the name of the lord right blessed be the name of the lord blessed be the name of the most high oh blessed be the name of the lord oh blessed be the
