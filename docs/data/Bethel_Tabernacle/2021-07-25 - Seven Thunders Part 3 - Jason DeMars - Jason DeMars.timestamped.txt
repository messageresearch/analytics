[2:43] everyone god bless you
[2:45] let's stand up together and pray
[2:50] heavenly father we just come before you
[2:52] lord and we ask that your holy spirit
[2:54] would just come
[2:55] and take your word lord make it alive in
[2:57] our hearts
[2:58] make it make it plain to us lord may may
[3:02] you reveal yourself to us more
[3:04] and more lord pray your blessing upon
[3:07] the sunday school
[3:09] the children sunday school as well the
[3:12] worship
[3:13] and the preaching of the word lord we
[3:14] ask that you would
[3:16] have the preeminence amongst us lord
[3:18] every heart every mind
[3:20] looking looking to you drawing from you
[3:22] father
[3:23] we ask these things in jesus name amen
[3:27] all right so if you want to pull up that
[3:28] powerpoint we are going to
[3:32] look at a few scriptures we'll read
[3:34] those scriptures and then
[3:36] i get half of you taking your seats and
[3:38] halfway are you standing up but
[3:39] we're going to stand up for the word
[3:46] must be tired out there um
[3:49] all right so what is a thunder
[3:53] let's look at a few scriptures second
[3:54] samuel 22 14
[3:57] the lord thundered from heaven and the
[3:59] most high uttered his
[4:01] voice psalm 18 verse
[4:05] 13 the lord also thundered in the
[4:08] heavens and the highest
[4:10] gave his voice psalm
[4:14] 104 verse 7
[4:17] at thy rebuke they fled at the voice of
[4:20] thy thunder
[4:21] they hasted away may the lord add the
[4:24] blessing to the reading of his word you
[4:26] can be seated
[4:28] where am i at here
[4:40] turn it on i gotta go backwards here
[4:43] yeah there there we go
[4:46] so as we see from those scriptures
[4:49] a thunder signifies the voice of god
[4:57] jesus speaking to the father in john
[5:00] 20 or john 12 28-30 father
[5:05] glorify thy name then came there a voice
[5:08] from heaven saying i have both glorified
[5:11] it and will glorify it
[5:13] the people therefore that stood by heard
[5:15] it
[5:16] and heard it said that it thundered
[5:18] others said
[5:19] an angel spake to him again
[5:23] jesus answered and said this voice came
[5:26] not because of me but for your
[5:29] sake so the people heard a thunder and
[5:31] jesus said this voice
[5:34] all right okay let's keep going
[5:39] so those thunders
[5:42] speak of the voice of god
[5:45] so we were talking about
[5:49] seven thunders under their voices the
[5:51] mighty angel comes down from heaven
[5:53] with an open book cries with a loud
[5:55] voice
[5:56] in other words he speaks something
[5:59] crying with a loud voice
[6:00] it's it's like it's speaking of
[6:02] preaching
[6:04] so he cries with a loud voice he speaks
[6:06] something
[6:07] and when he speaks something what
[6:09] happens
[6:11] seven thunders utter their voices all
[6:14] right
[6:14] so then who how does that
[6:18] get communicated down to us
[6:22] all right so mighty angel descends from
[6:25] heaven
[6:25] open book in his hand why does he have
[6:27] open book in his hand
[6:30] the seals have been opened so he's
[6:34] communicating something what is he
[6:35] communicating
[6:37] it's not rocket science he's
[6:40] communicating what's in the open book
[6:42] right then the seven thunders out of
[6:45] their voices
[6:46] what could the seven thunders be saying
[6:49] something from the open book
[6:53] and then it goes on it gives a uh
[6:56] what we would call a parenthetical
[6:59] statement
[7:00] that the angel the mighty angel says
[7:04] time will be no more or there'll be
[7:07] another way to put that would be
[7:08] there'll be no longer delay
[7:12] all right and then it says but but
[7:16] but but but what is it what does butt
[7:19] mean
[7:20] there's an exception to this statement
[7:22] time shall be no more but
[7:25] oh so there's an exception there's
[7:28] something that has to take place
[7:29] before time can be no longer
[7:33] which we know is not really
[7:37] say time is no longer
[7:40] that's not really how it goes down
[7:43] there's no longer a delay
[7:45] because there's even even that you have
[7:47] the tribulation period
[7:49] you have have which is time you have the
[7:52] millennium
[7:53] which is also time so it's not time
[7:56] is no longer it means there's no longer
[7:59] a delay
[7:59] a delay for what for them for the net
[8:01] for this thing to be fulfilled and the
[8:03] next thing
[8:03] next step to be taken
[8:06] so seven thunders under their voices
[8:11] and john goes to write it down so in
[8:13] other words it was something
[8:14] that was to be communicated to god's
[8:17] people
[8:19] all right so he's going to communicate
[8:21] it to god's people oh this is important
[8:23] write it down
[8:25] he's told not to write it to seal it up
[8:29] okay so does that mean
[8:32] it's it's forever sealed it's something
[8:34] we'll never know
[8:36] no it corresponds perfectly with what we
[8:38] talked about in daniel
[8:39] chapter 12. when is it sealed up until
[8:42] it's sealed until the time
[8:44] of the end and so
[8:47] god was going to use what
[8:50] who to communicate the seven thunders to
[8:53] us
[8:54] he started to use john
[8:58] but he stopped and said no it's not for
[9:01] now
[9:02] that's for later that's for the end of
[9:04] the age so if he was going to use
[9:07] um a man that he chose
[9:10] to write down his words right what was
[9:14] he going to what is he going to use at
[9:15] the end
[9:16] he would have to do use the same means
[9:18] he would not
[9:19] john he would have to use a man
[9:22] to communicate that not a council
[9:26] not not a theological seminary
[9:30] not tim lahaye and jerry jenkins
[9:34] writing the left behind books he would
[9:36] have to
[9:37] anoint a man
[9:41] to do it to bring and and show us what
[9:44] those seven thunders were saying
[9:48] well it's history right
[9:51] it's a that's a historical event it's
[9:53] done it's finished it's been
[9:55] communicated
[9:57] in the laodicean church chapter 9 in the
[10:00] church ages book
[10:02] now this messenger of malachi 4 and
[10:04] revelation 10
[10:05] 7 is going to do two things one
[10:07] according to malachi 4 you will turn the
[10:09] hearts of the children to the fathers
[10:12] 2 he will reveal the mysteries of the
[10:14] seven thunders in revelation 10
[10:16] which are the revelations contained
[10:19] in the seven seals it will be
[10:23] now listen to this statement it will be
[10:25] these divinely revealed
[10:27] mystery truths that literally turn the
[10:30] hearts of the children
[10:32] to the pentecostal fathers exactly so
[10:36] the seventh he's talking about this what
[10:38] are the mystery truths
[10:40] it's what's contained
[10:43] in that open book okay and it's what's
[10:46] communicated
[10:47] by the seven thunders to
[10:51] that messenger that messenger then
[10:54] brings those truths to us and he says
[10:57] those truths
[10:58] are what actually turn us back to the
[11:01] original
[11:02] apostolic faith so what are the truths
[11:10] the teachings of the apostles
[11:14] they were sealed up they were hidden the
[11:16] full meaning and understanding of what
[11:19] it was all about
[11:20] was not completely known throughout the
[11:22] church age
[11:24] and the and the purpose that they were
[11:27] sent for
[11:30] was didn't didn't get fulfilled why
[11:32] because they began as soon as the
[11:33] apostles passed away
[11:34] they fell away from these things
[11:37] what was god's purpose in the first age
[11:41] it was
[11:42] it was to give them this new covenant
[11:45] and this new covenant would produce what
[11:48] a raptured a people with rapturing faith
[11:51] that would be raptured but what happened
[11:54] they fell away
[11:56] as soon as the message was given they
[11:58] stopped pretty much started falling away
[12:00] from it right away
[12:01] so it had to be restored
[12:04] and now we we receive that restoration
[12:08] and what is it going to do it's going to
[12:09] produce what it was initially meant
[12:12] to produce so when brother branham bring
[12:14] we we talk about the seven thunders
[12:17] we don't need a message theological
[12:21] degree
[12:21] to understand what it is it's quite
[12:24] simple
[12:26] we don't need to figure it all out
[12:30] it's quite simple all right but
[12:33] yet you say okay well that's easy for
[12:35] you to say but go back
[12:36] and read the seventh seal and people
[12:39] come to
[12:40] seven different conclusions after they
[12:42] are done reading the seventh seal
[12:44] but let's let god be the interpreter
[12:48] of that don't don't
[12:51] take take what brother branham says in
[12:53] the seventh seal
[12:54] and then shut down and say it's not it's
[12:57] not
[12:58] to be revealed to the public that's my
[13:00] final and absolute
[13:02] that's it i'm done i don't want to
[13:04] listen to anything don't speak to me
[13:07] the seventh seal is closed that's what
[13:09] people do
[13:11] but brother branham continues on and he
[13:13] explains
[13:15] they even ask him the seven thunders
[13:17] weren't revealed
[13:18] we'll get to that quote i think it's
[13:20] maybe the next one
[13:23] all right
[13:30] i'm just gonna go through these
[13:37] five key points in understanding the
[13:38] seven thunders
[13:40] the seals were just the covering of the
[13:44] book
[13:44] right so they were sealed the book was
[13:48] sealed with seven seals when the seal
[13:50] was broken
[13:51] a vision came forth and describing what
[13:54] each seal was
[13:57] the thunders are the means
[14:01] of communicating the contents
[14:04] of the book to the prophet
[14:09] so we're going to read some quotes here
[14:16] the seven sealed book is revealed
[14:20] at the time of the seven thunders of
[14:22] revelation 10.
[14:30] the mysteries of the seven thunders
[14:33] all are already written in the bible
[14:37] but was missed back there remember
[14:40] nothing can be added to the bible
[14:44] and he said that this in that day
[14:48] that he see him come down and he eat up
[14:50] the little book and he put one foot on
[14:52] the land and one in the sea and swore by
[14:54] him that lives
[14:56] and ever and ever that time shall be no
[14:58] more and when he did
[14:59] seven thunders uttered their voices and
[15:01] when the seven thunders uttered their
[15:02] voices john said he was about to write
[15:04] and he said don't write it
[15:06] see and he sealed it what it is is a
[15:09] revelation
[15:10] on what has been missed back there
[15:13] it's already wrote here the bible it's
[15:16] in here
[15:18] it's to reveal what's already been
[15:20] written see because you can't add one
[15:22] thing to it or take
[15:24] one thing from it that's from the feast
[15:27] of trump the trumpets in 1964.
[15:35] all right so
[15:38] this is from the first seal and then
[15:40] there's coming forth seven mysterious
[15:42] thunders that's not even written at all
[15:44] that's right
[15:45] and i believe that through those
[15:47] thunders will be revealed in the last
[15:49] days
[15:50] in order to get the bride together for
[15:51] rapturing faith because what we got
[15:53] right now
[15:54] we wouldn't be able to do it there's
[15:55] something we've got to step farther
[15:58] we can't have enough faith for divine
[16:01] healing hardly
[16:02] we've got to have enough faith to be
[16:04] changed in a moment and be swept up out
[16:05] of this earth
[16:07] and we'll find that after a while the
[16:09] lord willing
[16:10] where it's written so it's not written
[16:14] but it's written
[16:16] seems like a contradiction but it makes
[16:19] perfect sense
[16:20] it's not written out in revelation 10
[16:24] 3 and 4. but we we can't
[16:27] take that and say we have a new
[16:30] revelation that we're writing more
[16:31] scripture about
[16:33] no it's revealing what's in there that's
[16:35] been missed
[16:43] unveiling of god now someone has been
[16:46] many
[16:47] has been saying to me and theologians
[16:49] said
[16:50] brother branham if the lord god said if
[16:52] you with your experience that the lord
[16:54] has given you for his people
[16:56] humbly saying this said you'd be
[16:58] eligible to write a bible yourself
[17:00] your word that god has manifested
[17:04] i said that might be true see he was
[17:06] trying to catch me see and i said but
[17:08] see you see i couldn't do that. he said
[17:10] why couldn't you you have all the
[17:11] qualifications
[17:13] i said but look but you look one word
[17:15] cannot be added or taken away
[17:17] see and he said well then them seven
[17:19] thunders you see
[17:20] said when them seven thunders blasting
[17:22] out won't that be a revelation be give
[17:24] to some man
[17:25] i said no sir it would be adding
[17:28] something to it or taking something from
[17:30] it
[17:30] it's all revealed in there and the seven
[17:33] seals opened up
[17:34] of the revelation of what that was
[17:39] amen beautiful balance
[17:46] we read this quote but it it's worth
[17:48] reading again
[17:51] this messenger of malachi 4
[17:54] and revelation 10 7 is going to do two
[17:56] things
[17:57] one according to malachi 4 he'll turn
[18:00] the hearts of the children to the
[18:01] fathers
[18:02] 2 he will reveal the mystery of the
[18:05] mysteries of the seven thunders in
[18:06] revelation 10
[18:08] which are the revelations contained in
[18:09] the seven seals
[18:11] it'll be these divinely revealed mystery
[18:13] truths that literally turn the hearts
[18:16] of the children to the pentecostal
[18:18] fathers
[18:20] i've had people say well that's fine but
[18:24] it's in the church ages book we really
[18:25] can't trust that
[18:27] for whatever reason they believe that
[18:29] the church age book
[18:31] was not written by brother branham it
[18:32] was just written by
[18:34] brother vale and brother branham didn't
[18:36] didn't approve of it which is not true
[18:39] but okay fine take that standpoint
[18:42] we have something that we can point to
[18:45] right here where brother branham says
[18:46] exactly the same thing in questions and
[18:49] answers
[18:52] he says have the seven thunders which
[18:54] equals seven
[18:56] mysteries already been revealed
[18:59] were they revealed in the seven seals
[19:01] but are yet not known
[19:02] to us as the thunders yet
[19:06] here's the answer no they were revealed
[19:09] in the seven seals
[19:11] that's what the thunders was about
[19:14] they was to reveal the seven thunders
[19:16] that had uttered their voices
[19:17] and no one could make out what it was
[19:20] john knew what it was but he was
[19:21] forbidden to write it he said
[19:23] now listen to this is brother branham's
[19:26] uh paraphrase
[19:27] of revelation chapter 10 verses
[19:30] 4 3 4 and
[19:34] 7. he says but the seventh angel
[19:39] in the days of his sounding listen he
[19:42] doesn't say the mystery of god should be
[19:43] finished what does he say
[19:45] he puts something in place of that but
[19:48] in the days of his sounding
[19:50] the seven mysteries of the seven
[19:52] thunders
[19:54] would be revealed all right so
[19:58] the mystery of god what is the mystery
[20:01] of god
[20:02] the seven mysteries of the seven
[20:03] thunders would be revealed
[20:06] all right so
[20:10] whether you take the church ages book or
[20:11] not it's still staring you right in the
[20:14] face
[20:14] that the prophet said his ministry would
[20:17] reveal what the seven thunders are
[20:20] we either believe that or we don't
[20:22] believe that
[20:24] that's all right you make your choice
[20:27] but i
[20:27] i can see it here i see it plainly in
[20:29] the scriptures
[20:30] it dovetails perfectly together
[20:33] beautiful
[20:34] amen so the mysteries truth switch the
[20:38] seven thunders
[20:39] uttered again the seals were the
[20:42] covering
[20:43] the thunders reveal the contents
[20:47] so mighty angel descends
[20:50] with an open book utters his voice
[20:54] seven thunders utter the mysteries in
[20:56] heaven let me back up
[20:58] when i first started on the missions
[21:00] field in 2012
[21:04] i did not understand this well
[21:07] i had no i i couldn't teach on it
[21:10] because i was i had a confusion
[21:14] i heard what many different preachers
[21:16] said
[21:17] and i felt like my goodness i i don't
[21:23] i can't explain it i don't understand it
[21:24] the person that led me to part of that
[21:26] probably is the person that led me to
[21:28] the message
[21:29] one of the reasons he left the message
[21:31] was he
[21:32] studied the seventh seventh seventh seal
[21:35] and his conclusion was brother branham
[21:37] didn't know what it was so how am i
[21:39] supposed to know what it was
[21:41] and i said well i think he knew what it
[21:42] was i just think that we're not seeing
[21:44] what it what it is and so you know you
[21:48] hear different ones say well
[21:49] seventh seal is closed it's not been
[21:51] open or the seven seals open but it's
[21:52] not revealed
[21:54] or you hear different people say well
[21:56] the seventh seven
[21:58] you know parts of the seventh seal are
[21:59] revealed but the seven thunders are
[22:01] still
[22:01] off in the future you know because
[22:03] they're gonna in the future
[22:05] way off in the future they'll bring us
[22:07] rapturing faith
[22:09] some people say they don't know what
[22:10] that is other people say well it's going
[22:11] to be seven men
[22:13] who are anointed to bring a message to
[22:15] bring rapturing faith to the bride
[22:17] around the world
[22:19] whatever all kinds of all kinds of
[22:21] things that
[22:22] cause me to be just everybody has a
[22:25] point but nobody has a point
[22:28] and and so i remember
[22:32] i think it was maybe uh the summer time
[22:36] in 2013 sitting in a car and
[22:40] knowing the people i was working with
[22:42] i've gotten to know them
[22:43] gotten to see where they're at from
[22:45] their background in the message
[22:47] and they had no understanding of of
[22:50] most of these things they knew basically
[22:55] they were uh just another oneness
[22:57] denomination
[22:59] that had serpent seed and brother
[23:00] branham's name attached to it
[23:02] and so these were things that i was
[23:06] so heavy burdened in my heart that they
[23:08] needed to see
[23:09] the reality of the message and i'm
[23:11] saying lord i can't even explain it to
[23:13] them and here i'm the one that's
[23:14] supposed to be
[23:15] teaching them guiding them in these
[23:17] things helping to get them to see the
[23:19] message more clearly and
[23:22] of course i've been studying it for a
[23:24] long time um
[23:26] 10 plus years and i couldn't come to a
[23:29] conclusion
[23:30] and i just at up to that point for a
[23:33] while
[23:34] i furiously studied oh i have it figured
[23:36] out have it figured out and then at the
[23:37] end i'd say i don't have it figured out
[23:39] and finally i just quit and said lord
[23:42] this is in your hands
[23:43] i need to be able to teach this
[23:47] but i don't have an understanding of it
[23:50] you need to help me
[23:51] so i was sitting in a taxi cab just
[23:54] praying pouring my heart out to the lord
[23:57] about this
[23:58] i need to help these people and it was
[24:00] like
[24:01] the lord spoke to my heart said now what
[24:04] order does that happen in
[24:08] okay this is not a new rev understand
[24:10] i'm not bringing you a new revelation
[24:12] i'm saying i want to understand it the
[24:14] way the prophet taught it
[24:16] and the way the scripture makes it plain
[24:17] to us so the lord asked me what order
[24:20] does that happen in
[24:21] okay the law said the mighty angel
[24:24] descends from heaven with the open book
[24:26] seven thunders under their voices the
[24:28] seventh angel finishes the mystery he
[24:31] said
[24:32] exactly and it was instantaneous
[24:36] instantaneous revelation to me
[24:39] i i get it now the seventh angel
[24:43] reveals exactly what the seven thunders
[24:48] spoke you know
[24:51] you say well isn't that easy isn't that
[24:53] simple isn't that basic
[24:54] it kind of is it kind of is but if you
[24:58] if if you hear lots of different
[25:00] thoughts and voices
[25:02] and you start to look brother branham
[25:05] purposely makes the seventh seal
[25:08] when he preaches it right he preaches at
[25:11] one time he says i said
[25:13] too much shut that down don't release it
[25:16] i'm going to re-record it and he just
[25:19] gives
[25:20] a few basic things and he wants to leave
[25:22] it in mystery format
[25:24] then as time goes on what does he do he
[25:28] begins to
[25:29] unfold it explain it in other words when
[25:32] he
[25:32] brought the seventh seal in 1963
[25:36] he left it in a mystery format said it
[25:38] won't be revealed to the public
[25:40] right it's not going to be known to the
[25:42] public and then if you follow his
[25:44] message
[25:45] he starts to unfold that it's like when
[25:48] he preached the seventh seal
[25:50] it started a process it unleashed
[25:52] something
[25:53] started a process and then you see him
[25:56] in the sermons like christ is the
[25:57] mystery of god revealed feast of
[25:59] trumpets
[26:00] questions and answers these different
[26:01] things he begins to stop and explain it
[26:05] so it really yes yes it is
[26:09] simple but god puts it in a way
[26:12] in a parable right he he explains things
[26:16] christ explains things to people in
[26:19] riddles why
[26:20] because some people it's given to
[26:22] understand
[26:23] and other people it's not given to
[26:25] understand so why would you think
[26:27] brother branham
[26:28] would be a little bit obtuse about the
[26:30] third pull he was told
[26:32] don't exp you're goofing up you're
[26:34] messing up
[26:35] explaining the first poll in the second
[26:36] poll don't explain it
[26:39] at the end he just in one phrase would
[26:42] say
[26:43] the third poll is the opening of the
[26:45] word
[26:47] to the world they say what is he talking
[26:49] about
[26:50] that makes no sense to those of us who
[26:52] are feasting on the word
[26:55] it's god in simplicity
[27:00] all right
[27:05] you read can you read that brother
[27:07] luther
[27:09] i'm just going to take that off so if
[27:12] you look at this this is
[27:14] is this the sign of the answers uh
[27:17] 1962 december 30th this is the sermon
[27:20] that brother branham explains
[27:22] the vision he had about meeting the
[27:24] seven angels
[27:25] in the desert in arizona and he's
[27:29] explaining what's the purpose
[27:30] and what god is doing so he says the
[27:33] seventh angel of revelation
[27:34] 10 7 is the seventh church age messenger
[27:36] see now watch in the and in the days
[27:39] but in the days of the voice of the
[27:40] seventh angel when he shall begin the
[27:42] sound
[27:43] the mystery of god should be sent
[27:44] finished now sounding forth this
[27:46] messenger the seventh angel here is
[27:48] sounding forth his message to the
[27:49] laodicean church
[27:51] notice his type of message now it wasn't
[27:53] to the first angel wasn't given that
[27:55] second third fourth fifth sixth but it's
[27:57] the seventh angel
[27:59] had this type of message what was it
[28:01] notice his type of message
[28:03] finishing all the mysteries of god that
[28:05] are written in the book
[28:06] the seventh angel is winding up all the
[28:08] mystery this laying loose ended
[28:11] all out through these organizations and
[28:13] denominations
[28:15] the seventh angel gathers them up and
[28:17] finishes the entire mystery that's what
[28:19] the bible said finishes the mysteries
[28:22] of the written book now let's note a few
[28:25] of these mysteries and if you want to
[28:26] write them down first i'll take what
[28:27] scofield says here in matthew 13.
[28:30] if you'd like to type some of them down
[28:32] if you haven't got a scofield bible you
[28:33] might read what he thinks
[28:34] some of the mysteries are now on the
[28:36] 11th verse and he answered and said unto
[28:37] them
[28:38] because it's given unto you his
[28:40] disciples because given
[28:41] you to know the mysteries of the kingdom
[28:43] of heaven but not to them
[28:44] but to them it is not given the
[28:46] mysteries here is the mystery
[28:48] a mystery in scripture is a previously
[28:50] hidden truth
[28:52] now divinely revealed but which a
[28:54] supernatural
[28:55] element still remains despite the
[28:58] revelation
[28:59] the greater mysteries and the great
[29:00] mysteries are
[29:03] mysteries of the kingdom of heaven
[29:06] israel's blindness
[29:07] translation of the living saints new
[29:10] testament
[29:11] church one body jews and gentiles the
[29:14] bride of christ
[29:15] living christ manifested mystery of god
[29:18] even christ
[29:19] the process which godliness is restored
[29:21] to man the mystery of iniquity
[29:23] the mystery of the seven stars
[29:26] and you can go on and and mystery
[29:28] babylon serpent seed
[29:30] doctrines of grace no eternal hell the
[29:33] baptism of the holy spirit not
[29:35] evidence of speaking in tongues but the
[29:36] person of christ
[29:38] living in you doing his works water
[29:41] baptism
[29:42] pillar of fire returning to the church
[29:44] then we can go on and he talks about
[29:46] who is this melchizedek marriage and
[29:47] divorce
[29:49] etc the rapture etc etc these are these
[29:53] mysteries that he preaches
[29:56] a lot of them are not too complicated
[29:58] right
[29:59] they're things that were left off by the
[30:02] by
[30:04] they were they fell away from the roman
[30:06] catholic church fell away from them
[30:07] god raised up ministers to restore a
[30:10] portion of that they created the
[30:12] denomination around that
[30:13] so the loose ends were laying out there
[30:15] in the denominations
[30:17] so the prophet came and said here's a
[30:19] truth that was god revealed
[30:21] here's a truth that god revealed here's
[30:22] another one that god revealed
[30:24] here's another one god revealed and he
[30:26] put it all together and said
[30:27] here you go so what did the seven
[30:30] thunder say
[30:33] that's what they taught us they restored
[30:35] us back to the original faith
[30:37] again the mighty angel descends with the
[30:40] open book what does that mean
[30:42] the lord himself shall descend
[30:45] from heaven with a shout brother branham
[30:48] says
[30:48] the shout what is the shout it's the
[30:51] message going forth first
[30:53] so what is this mighty angel coming down
[30:55] clothed with the cloud
[30:57] and and pillar feed his pillars of fire
[30:59] and so forth face shining with the glory
[31:01] of god
[31:02] rainbow around his head what that's god
[31:06] coming down with an open book what does
[31:09] it mean
[31:10] he's coming down to reveal something to
[31:12] us
[31:14] he ca he god himself came down to reveal
[31:18] himself
[31:19] through a prophet to open his word to us
[31:23] that's what the seven thunders is all
[31:25] about that's what the opening of the
[31:26] seals is all about
[31:28] it's not really as complicated as
[31:31] everybody wants to make it
[31:32] sound it's actually quite simple when it
[31:36] comes down to it god
[31:37] speaks in riddles and parables so that
[31:41] seeing
[31:42] you won't see but when you come down to
[31:44] it what is it
[31:46] pretty simple it's god had a means
[31:49] of revealing himself to his people seven
[31:53] angels met the prophet out in the desert
[31:56] came with the noise of a thunder one
[31:59] plus one
[32:00] equals two but yet you get
[32:03] all of these all of these things
[32:05] together
[32:06] put it all together and we start going
[32:10] oh i don't understand i don't get it
[32:13] just back up slow down separate yourself
[32:17] from all the noise and i don't mean to
[32:20] say
[32:21] message preachers are noise but over the
[32:24] years
[32:24] there's been a lot of noise there's been
[32:27] a lot of noise there's been a lot of
[32:28] confusion why because they
[32:30] themselves are confused and they preach
[32:33] it in a confusing way and the reality is
[32:36] for the bride it's so simple and that's
[32:38] what god has been trying to bring us to
[32:41] and yet we've been really working hard
[32:44] to make it complicated
[32:46] lord help us to back up separate
[32:48] ourselves from the noise
[32:50] get alone with god and let him speak
[32:54] down into our hearts amen let's
[32:56] stand up
[33:00] heavenly father we're so thankful lord
[33:02] for your word

[33:32] faith in the image of the son of god
[33:38] that would rapture a people out of this
[33:40] earth lord

[33:45] voices
