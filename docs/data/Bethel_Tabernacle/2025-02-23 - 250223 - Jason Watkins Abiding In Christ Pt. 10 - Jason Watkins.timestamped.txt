[37:13] greetings to U our visitors amen there
[37:16] in the back God bless you we're happy to

[37:20] chapter 1 we're just going to I have a
[37:23] lengthy reading so we're just going to
[37:24] read a couple of verses we'll let you be
[37:26] seated and and um dismiss our um
[37:30] musicians and then we'll continue
[37:34] reading this is the creation
[37:37] story amen Genesis 1 and
[37:41] one in the beginning God created the
[37:44] Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was
[37:47] without form and void and darkness was
[37:51] upon the face of the deep and the spirit
[37:54] of God moved upon the face of the water
[37:58] now it's interesting because if you
[38:01] realize that the Earth is without form
[38:05] and void and it's a little while later
[38:08] in the scriptures that we understand the
[38:11] principle that God will not allow his
[38:14] word to return unto him void so when he
[38:18] sends forth his word it it'll take
[38:21] something that's void something that's
[38:23] chaos like we're reading here in Genesis
[38:27] and the word is sent to bring the chaos
[38:32] into order amen it's sent to take the
[38:35] void and make it into what it was
[38:37] supposed to be is that easy amen amen
[38:41] let's pray father we thank you for your
[38:45] revealed word that we are gathering
[38:48] around this morning thank you Lord for

[39:23] say everything I have written you're
[39:25] able you sometimes you won't say any of
[39:27] it and you'll just change me completely

[39:35] I'm just surrendering to you right
[39:37] readily this morning asking you to be
[39:40] the preacher in our midst now our sick

[39:47] and we're asking for your continued
[39:49] Mercy Lord we have wonderful testimonies
[39:53] that have come in of great mercies that
[39:56] you've shown to your people people even
[39:57] recently Lord and we're grateful for
[40:00] those things and we're asking that you
[40:02] continue that beautiful work that you do
[40:04] in the lives of your family now bless
[40:07] your ministers Lord who are away
[40:09] ministering and bless us one and all
[40:12] today we pray we commit it all to you in
[40:14] Jesus name amen God bless you friends
[40:17] you can be seated
[40:29] amen let's continue in our
[40:33] reading and God said let there be light
[40:36] and there was light and God saw the
[40:39] light that it was good and God divided
[40:41] the light from the darkness and God
[40:43] called the light day and the Darkness he
[40:46] called night and the evening and the
[40:48] morning were the first day and God said
[40:52] let there be a firmament in the midst of
[40:55] the waters and let it divide the water
[40:57] from the waters you're you're reading
[41:00] about a very meticulous being this is a
[41:04] a a being of great
[41:07] precision and God made the firment
[41:10] divided the waters which were under the
[41:12] firmament from the waters which were
[41:15] above the firmament and it was so and
[41:17] God called the firmament Heaven and the
[41:20] evening and the morning were the second
[41:22] day so this is a being who who knows
[41:25] what he's doing he's definitely not fig
[41:27] fing this out as he goes he's
[41:29] accomplishing a purpose all right that's
[41:31] the whole word of God is to accomplish a
[41:34] purpose amen all right and God said let
[41:37] the waters under the heaven be gathered
[41:39] thank you brother the Tony to gather un
[41:41] one place and let the dry land appear
[41:44] and it was
[41:46] so I love how that everything that God
[41:49] decides to do it was
[41:52] so and God called the dry land Earth and
[41:55] the and the Gathering Together of the
[41:56] waters is called he sees and God saw
[41:58] that it was good and God said he keeps
[42:01] repeating that it was good goes to the
[42:03] next day and it was good and God said
[42:04] let the Earth bring forth grass the herb
[42:07] yielding seed and the fruit tree
[42:09] yielding fruit after his kind whose seed
[42:12] is in itself upon the Earth and it was
[42:14] so this is a being who has literally
[42:16] thought of everything nothing's going to
[42:19] get past him you need to have that
[42:21] confidence that he sent a word don't
[42:23] worry nothing's going to get past him he
[42:26] sent you everything you need to get you
[42:28] home amen and the Earth brought forth
[42:31] grass see it just obeyed God's word and
[42:34] brother Ram talks about how that God
[42:37] could have the Bible says he you know
[42:39] the foolishness of preaching which is
[42:42] astonishing to me that he sent Fallen
[42:45] preachers to redeem Fallen people and
[42:47] bring them back to some kind of
[42:50] perfection no wonder the world calls it
[42:52] foolishness and a prophet said God could
[42:55] have used the trees to preach the gospel
[42:57] we could have used the wind he said in
[42:59] fact had he done that it had been over a
[43:01] long time ago cuz the wind and the trees
[43:03] would have just obeyed him it's man that
[43:05] gives him his problems see all right all
[43:10] right and so verse 13 or ver let me
[43:14] finish 12 again and the Earth brought
[43:15] forth grass herb yielding seed after his
[43:17] kind the tree yielding fruit whose seed
[43:20] was in itself after his kind and God saw
[43:22] that it was good there that is again God
[43:24] saw that it was good and the evening and
[43:26] the morning were the thir third day so
[43:27] we're clicking right along here and God
[43:30] said let there be lights in the
[43:31] firmament the heaven to divide the day
[43:33] from the night this meticulous being
[43:35] goes on to say and let them be for signs
[43:38] let in other words let them have a
[43:39] purpose I don't just put them there to
[43:41] put them there all right and for seasons
[43:44] and for days and years and let them be
[43:47] for lights in the firmament of Heaven to
[43:49] give light upon the Earth and it was so
[43:52] why brother Jason are you reading this
[43:54] text in this way because I'm trying by
[43:57] all help of the holy spirit that if I
[44:00] can nail down today that that you are
[44:04] here for a purpose and that God gave you
[44:07] life for a reason and he knows what the
[44:10] reason is and he has the purpose set his
[44:14] his problem is not what he knows or
[44:16] doesn't know the problem is in what you
[44:19] are willing or not willing to give him
[44:22] control
[44:23] of all
[44:25] right uh so he says let's let's carry on
[44:29] where were we at we were at 16 let's get
[44:31] 17 and God set them in the firmament of
[44:34] the heaven to give light upon the Earth
[44:36] and to rule over the day and over the
[44:38] night and to divide the light from the
[44:40] darkness and God saw that it was good in
[44:42] the evening and the morning were the
[44:44] fourth day now can I ask you a question
[44:47] if God is all of this busyness and this
[44:50] is covering Bible days not not Earth
[44:53] days Bible days Thousand-Year Cycles
[44:56] then and every and everything he does is
[44:59] good would you really worry about him
[45:02] controlling your
[45:03] life do you think you could match his
[45:06] track record of everything being good in
[45:09] your life if you give him control see
[45:13] now he doesn't say that you would like
[45:15] everything he does in your life but
[45:18] it'll work together for the good if you
[45:21] allow it see and God said verse 20 and
[45:25] God said let the waters bring for for
[45:27] abundantly the mo the the uh abundantly
[45:30] the moving creature that hath life and
[45:33] foul that may fly above the Earth in the
[45:36] open firmament of heaven and God created
[45:39] great whales and every living creature
[45:41] that moveth which the waters brought
[45:43] forth abundantly after their kind and
[45:45] every winged foul after his kind and God
[45:47] saw that it was good and God blessed
[45:50] them and said be fruitful and multiply
[45:52] and fill the waters uh in the seas and
[45:55] let foul multip Supply in the earth and
[45:57] the evening and the morning were the
[45:59] fifth day and God now we come to the
[46:01] sixth day now watch and God said let the
[46:05] Earth bring forth the living creature
[46:08] after his kind cattle and creeping thing
[46:10] the Beast of the earth after his kind
[46:12] and it was so and God made the Beast of
[46:15] the earth after his kind and cattle
[46:17] after their kind and everything that
[46:18] creepeth upon the Earth after his kind
[46:21] and God saw that it was good and God
[46:24] said let us make man in our IM image
[46:27] after our likeness and let them have
[46:30] dominion over the fish of the sea and
[46:32] over the fowl of the air and over the
[46:33] cattle and over all the Earth and over
[46:35] every creeping thing that creepeth upon
[46:37] the Earth so God created man in his own
[46:39] image in the image of God created he him
[46:42] male and female created he them and God
[46:45] blessed them and God said unto them be
[46:47] fruitful and multiply and replenish the
[46:49] Earth and subdue it have dominion over
[46:51] the fish of the sea and over the fowl of
[46:53] the air and over every living thing that
[46:55] moveth upon the Earth now he goes on
[46:58] down and on down uh and
[47:01] verse go let's go to 31 uh Caleb uh and
[47:05] God saw everything that he had made and
[47:10] behold now watch watch him increase it
[47:13] it's very good amen all right and the
[47:16] evening and the morning were the sixth
[47:18] day now turn with me to Revelation chap
[47:24] 22 ain't you glad I let you be seated
[47:26] for all
[47:28] this revelation
[47:31] 22 and let's start at verse
[47:36] 16 I Jesus have sent M Angel to testify
[47:41] unto you these things in the churches I
[47:44] am the root and The Offspring of David
[47:47] and the bright and morning star that is
[47:49] an astonishing statement I am both the
[47:52] root and The Offspring of David you
[47:56] remember matth Matthew tracked his
[47:57] generation backwards to David and on
[48:00] back to Abraham but Jesus is saying yeah
[48:03] I Am The Offspring but I'm also I was
[48:05] before
[48:06] David this is going to be important as
[48:09] we
[48:09] go I am the root and offspring of David
[48:12] and the bright and morning star and the
[48:14] spirit and the bride say come and let
[48:18] him that heareth say come and let him
[48:21] that is a thirst come and whosoever will
[48:25] let him take the water of life freely so
[48:28] the bride has a voice and a message that
[48:32] is an invitation to come to this one who
[48:35] is the bright and Morning Star that's
[48:37] her job see all right for I testify unto
[48:41] every man that heareth the words of the
[48:43] prophecy of this book If any man shall
[48:45] add unto these things God shall add unto
[48:47] him the plagues that are written in this
[48:48] book and if any man shall take away from
[48:51] the words of the book of this prophecy
[48:53] God shall take away his part out of the
[48:55] book of life and of the holy city and
[48:58] from the things which are written in the
[49:00] book now this is not just merely
[49:03] doctrinal uh destroying Doctrine adding
[49:07] to Doctrine or taking away from Doctrine
[49:10] the people who are going to face these
[49:13] plagues and face this destruction are
[49:16] people who when God tried to bring his
[49:19] word into their life they altered it
[49:22] they changed it they added they took
[49:24] away because they wanted to live the
[49:27] life they wanted to
[49:28] live and therefore your life is a voice
[49:31] so therefore you added to the word and
[49:34] you took away from the word and though
[49:36] no wonder the world in in overwhelming
[49:39] majority is going to go down in
[49:42] Tribulation plagues and judgments and
[49:45] have their names removed from The Book
[49:47] of Life don't do it friends don't do it
[49:50] let the Lord have all the way and will
[49:54] and word and his word is his will let
[49:57] that be your life and refuse anything
[50:01] anyone says refuse what you say refuse
[50:04] what anyone thinks what you think we
[50:07] only have one one source to get us home
[50:12] amen so it's all about surrender
[50:15] watch he which testifieth these things
[50:18] saith surely I come quickly even so amen
[50:22] come Lord Jesus the grace of our Lord
[50:24] Jesus Christ be with you all amen now
[50:28] okay now there's my
[50:33] text so I I I want you now to just think
[50:37] with me for a little
[50:38] while so in Genesis 1 vers 1 through 28
[50:44] and I and I want to say this I want to
[50:46] say this that everything he did in
[50:50] Genesis one that we read was not just
[50:54] God doing a one-off amen
[50:57] that he just did that and that's a
[50:59] historical event it has no impact today
[51:02] that is completely an upside down way to
[51:04] to look at it it was not a one-off God
[51:07] was initiating a plan in Genesis 1 that
[51:11] would run all the way through human
[51:14] history to
[51:15] now the plan would never
[51:20] change cuz he never changes his mind
[51:22] about his
[51:23] word now the atheist doesn't believe in
[51:26] him at all all and the agnostic accepts
[51:28] some kind of originator some kind of
[51:31] higher power but his view is generally
[51:34] at best that this being is is is
[51:37] impersonal and he isn't involved in
[51:39] human history but actually nothing could
[51:42] be further from the truth than that see
[51:47] firstly this being is the almighty God
[51:50] Of Heaven and Earth of all the heavens
[51:53] and earth and has been uh very much
[51:58] directly and what's he been doing he's
[52:00] been getting his generation from Genesis
[52:03] 1 to revelation
[52:06] 22 and he starts in and in the beginning
[52:10] God created and at the end of it he's
[52:13] coming down and he's saying now I've got
[52:15] a bride and she's got a voice and this
[52:18] is my this is the final display and I've
[52:21] been spending 6,000 years getting her
[52:23] from there first I had to build a
[52:25] Heavens now I had to build an earth then
[52:27] I had to bring it in order then I had to
[52:28] go I had to go down the evolution tree
[52:31] and start you know getting the the water
[52:33] supplied then the Earth supplied then
[52:35] the animals then I came to man and then
[52:38] I started working with man I sent him my
[52:40] word he rejected it he fell then I sent
[52:43] a substitution to redeeming back and
[52:46] this is what's been going on for 6,000
[52:48] years so for someone to suggest that God
[52:51] is impersonal and not involved in human
[52:53] Affairs that's the probably the slickest
[52:55] LIE the devil has ever told
[52:59] Humanity so in the days of creation it's
[53:03] interesting that he he what he's been
[53:05] doing is he's he's been getting his
[53:09] Generation Now what are his what is who
[53:14] are his generation and I have to and and
[53:18] a lot of times we if we say who then a
[53:21] lot of times it sounds like we're trying
[53:23] to exclude some and this is a this is a
[53:26] M club and you know and it's not it's
[53:28] not about this isn't a clubhouse you
[53:31] understand Jesus died for the sins of
[53:32] the whole world all right so the the the
[53:36] gospel goes out to whomsoever will it
[53:38] doesn't really say who will or anyone
[53:40] will but whoever does can be saved so so
[53:43] we realize that that that that when we
[53:46] speak about his generation it's those
[53:50] who were originally made in His image so
[53:54] whoever comes into that IM image is part
[53:57] of that original creation and the fact
[53:59] that their life is an image of the word
[54:01] proves proves their
[54:03] origin amen you understand it
[54:07] demonstrates their
[54:10] origin it's interesting that in the days
[54:12] of
[54:13] creation we see that God and I and I and
[54:18] and I heard a Hebrew scholar talking
[54:20] about this and I made some notes of what
[54:22] he was saying I don't read Hebrew and I
[54:24] don't I don't read it at all but I was
[54:26] following a Hebrew scholar and he was
[54:29] talking about how that in the six days
[54:32] of creation God demonstrates three
[54:36] different ways through three different
[54:38] ways why the creation of man when he
[54:42] made Man In His Image was to God far
[54:46] more important than all the previous
[54:47] five days all right and the first thing
[54:51] that he shows is the word count in the
[54:54] Hebrew text and he actually had a piure
[54:56] of the Hebrew text of of all the
[54:58] creation days and it just might as well
[55:00] be Egyptian hieroglyphics to me but this
[55:02] was his breakdown and he started talking
[55:05] about how that that that you when you
[55:07] start on the on day one there's about 30
[55:10] some odd words describing days one and
[55:13] day two and it ramps up slightly to day
[55:15] two then it ramps up into the 60s 60
[55:19] words uh covering day three and day four
[55:23] and then in day five it drops back into
[55:25] the 50 but then in day six it launches
[55:29] and pegs at 148 words more than double
[55:34] what he had originally uh and and and
[55:37] almost triple uh from day one secondly
[55:40] it it's also the only place in the six
[55:44] Bible days where he says it is good it
[55:48] is very good amen the third way is that
[55:53] in the Hebrew text it is the only
[55:56] Creation Day that has the definite
[55:59] article that appears in the text and he
[56:01] shows a highlight of it you can see wow
[56:03] it's different than the previous five
[56:05] days and so the point to be taken is
[56:08] that is that the most important things
[56:11] are not the stars and the galaxies and
[56:15] the fish of the Sea and the birds of the
[56:17] air the most important thing is that
[56:20] there's a creation In His Image
[56:23] something that's brought into his
[56:25] likeness and is blessed to multiply in
[56:27] His image going
[56:29] forward so you you realize friends that
[56:32] that that this is so intentional this is
[56:36] so planned this is so controlled th this
[56:40] is not a controlled experiment he
[56:41] already knows what's going to happen
[56:43] we've already read it in revelation 22
[56:46] amen so he's not going to fail no matter
[56:50] what void in chaos he won't let his word
[56:52] return voice and he'll bring the chaos
[56:54] into order that's what he did to me
[56:56] that's that's what he did to you that's
[56:57] what he's trying to do right now
[57:01] see so David could see that he cared for
[57:05] men David looked up into those
[57:07] Stars I behold the heavens and what is
[57:10] man that thou art mindful of him brother
[57:12] Bram would say that he cares and he
[57:15] would preach a sermon called he cares do
[57:18] you care and he would go down it's a
[57:20] beautiful sermon brother Bram goes
[57:22] through the Bible and walks the people
[57:23] through the scriptures as any word
[57:25] Prophet would that's why I've told you
[57:27] before when you listen to a tape
[57:28] remember that you're you're being taken
[57:30] on a journey go go with him get your
[57:32] Bible go with him you're on a journey go
[57:34] through the scriptures and he's going to
[57:37] show cases where how God cared and he
[57:40] come in the days of Abraham the days of
[57:42] Moses the days of David and God showed
[57:44] how he cared and he comes to a a young
[57:46] man and a and a woman and there's a
[57:48] terrible problem in the in the home and
[57:49] the marriage and the man is losing his
[57:51] mind and and and they had just left an
[57:54] interview and and brother bam can't even
[57:55] get hardly gone the people are gone and
[57:58] the man is having a nervous breakdown
[58:00] and they bring him back and and and and
[58:02] and and to shorten the story it finally
[58:04] comes down to God comes down and
[58:07] discerns what's wrong and heals it and
[58:10] breaks the power of the devil which was
[58:12] a lie and that's what the devil lies to
[58:15] you about that you can't be everything
[58:17] God wants you to be you can be and he
[58:19] has sent a word to accomplish it amen
[58:23] come on and he says see God cares cared
[58:26] about that young man he cares and
[58:29] brother brandham says does he care oh my
[58:32] does he care and he says but the
[58:35] question is do you
[58:38] care you got to care first then he'll
[58:42] care
[58:45] see so do you get it friends
[58:49] that that he's been active over 6,000
[58:53] years getting his creation from Genesis
[58:56] 1 to revelation 22 and that's what he's
[58:59] been busy doing all this time do you get
[59:02] it that you have been called and chosen
[59:05] to be an active participant in something
[59:09] much larger than you do you absorb that
[59:13] young people teenagers do you absorb
[59:16] that you haven't just been born in a
[59:17] certain family and come to a certain
[59:19] church and hear a certain Doctrine you
[59:20] have been invited and you are compelled
[59:23] to be an active participant God wants to
[59:26] see your life walking through the word
[59:28] of God Amen see
[59:31] amen so why you know a lot of times we
[59:35] we wonder you know and and I think it's
[59:37] a fair question for a preacher to ask
[59:40] you you know why why do you keep or why
[59:45] would you keep building your life
[59:49] here in the way that you
[59:52] desire when you know when you already
[59:55] know by the Bible that the that the
[59:59] heart of a of a man that's born in sin
[1:00:02] is deceitful it's desperately
[1:00:05] wicked the Bible talks about the heart
[1:00:08] because it comes in a fallen Condition
[1:00:10] it's it's deceitful above all things and
[1:00:13] desperately wicked I don't think God
[1:00:16] could use pler language to get you to
[1:00:19] understand you can't trust your Fallen
[1:00:21] nature why why the so the question
[1:00:24] becomes why would you keep building your
[1:00:25] life here in the way that you desire
[1:00:28] when you know your heart in a fallen
[1:00:30] condition is deceitful above all things
[1:00:32] and will lead you every time away from
[1:00:36] God right
[1:00:38] amen it will lead you and what does that
[1:00:42] even mean let me let me bring it down to
[1:00:44] your address it'll lead you away from
[1:00:47] God's plan for your life
[1:00:50] amen so why why do you take it you know
[1:00:55] uh to to mean I mean what do you take it
[1:00:58] to mean if I could say it that way what
[1:01:01] do you think it means when you pray and
[1:01:05] you say Lord come into my heart come I
[1:01:10] want and people pray that and think that
[1:01:12] you know they they're coming to a
[1:01:13] conversion they hear a sermon they
[1:01:15] follow in conviction and the and the
[1:01:17] invitation is given why don't you invite
[1:01:19] the Lord to come into your heart and
[1:01:20] people bow their heads and they say Lord
[1:01:21] Jesus I accept you please come into my
[1:01:24] heart come into my my life what do you
[1:01:27] take that to
[1:01:28] mean if you're going to stay in
[1:01:34] control wh what does that even mean to
[1:01:36] you
[1:01:38] see my PowerPoint please Brothers I want
[1:01:42] to catch these quotes uh just the last
[1:01:45] end of some quotes that I had last time
[1:01:48] we're taking a subtitled day second book
[1:01:50] of
[1:01:51] Acts this is what we read at the end of
[1:01:54] of of of the ninth installment today's
[1:01:56] part 10 one day down on Jordan after
[1:01:58] that Masterpiece had been formed and
[1:02:00] made speaking of Jesus made here he come
[1:02:03] descending down on the wings of a dove
[1:02:05] that's him this is John baptizing Jesus
[1:02:07] in the water he was so enthused with
[1:02:09] this masterpiece until he struck him on
[1:02:12] on Calvary that he would die for the
[1:02:14] rest of us that's imperfect that through
[1:02:16] the shedding of his blood he might bring
[1:02:19] many masterpieces being a bride to his
[1:02:21] son so this is like when he takes
[1:02:24] Michelangelo and he makes the sculpture
[1:02:26] of Moses and he gets inspired and he he
[1:02:29] strikes it and he says this is what God
[1:02:31] did God got so enthused his son was so
[1:02:34] perfect it was it was a masterpiece he
[1:02:37] had looked for and he he tried he
[1:02:40] couldn't get it in Moses he couldn't get
[1:02:42] it in David he couldn't get it in
[1:02:43] Abraham they all had mistakes they all
[1:02:45] made errors he couldn't get it in Noah
[1:02:47] he couldn't get it in
[1:02:49] anyone even John the Baptist later
[1:02:52] wonders if he is even Messiah so but now
[1:02:55] he's got one it's a perfect Masterpiece
[1:02:59] and he smites him at Calvary watch
[1:03:03] Masterpiece is scarred because the
[1:03:05] enthusiasm of God to see such a
[1:03:07] masterpiece I hope you'll absorb that
[1:03:09] word enthusiasm God is in has a lot of
[1:03:12] enthusiasm for what he wants you to be
[1:03:15] he's not passive he's active see so he
[1:03:19] struck him for us all there he died to
[1:03:23] perfect we I love that to perfect we who
[1:03:25] are imperfect there's no denominational
[1:03:28] mixture in it anywhere anywhere my house
[1:03:30] my children born of my jees amen glory
[1:03:34] to God my jeans now watch this are in
[1:03:38] them I put my word in them I'll write
[1:03:42] them upon the tables of their heart
[1:03:44] that's my family the family of the body
[1:03:46] of Jesus Christ his family yes amen see
[1:03:52] now let me see do I want to oh yeah his
[1:03:55] his family the body of Jesus Christ the
[1:03:59] family all right
[1:04:01] now you you have to be very careful when
[1:04:04] you when you go and you start talking
[1:04:08] about the expression of God and because
[1:04:11] because the danger is pantheism of
[1:04:13] course and pantheism just simply is a is
[1:04:17] a heretical teaching that's remember
[1:04:20] there always has to be a genuine to have
[1:04:22] a counterfeit some sometimes to
[1:04:24] counterfeit can be very close but it all
[1:04:25] it takes is one word off amen see one
[1:04:28] three-letter word is what got Eve and so
[1:04:32] pantheism depicts the universe as all
[1:04:36] coming from uh all coming from a single
[1:04:40] source and therefore God is simply the
[1:04:42] whole
[1:04:43] universe and if I would say William
[1:04:47] brandham said he fills all time space
[1:04:49] and Eternity a theologian would go
[1:04:51] that's pantheism and it would be except
[1:04:54] for the point that William circles back
[1:04:56] around and says now he's not like the
[1:04:58] wind he is a being he lives in a house
[1:05:02] see so it's not pantheism at all it but
[1:05:05] it is but pantheism is a counterfeit of
[1:05:08] what is true that that all of the
[1:05:11] universe is an expression of God I mean
[1:05:13] that's what Paul taught us that we are
[1:05:16] of him in him and we are of him and we
[1:05:18] come from him and we're in him and he's
[1:05:19] in us see but yet at the same time
[1:05:23] you're not self-existing and you can't
[1:05:25] exist outside of his life and there
[1:05:27] could be no life outside of his life
[1:05:29] amen so that's that's the that's the the
[1:05:33] difference so so you know I when we
[1:05:36] teach on these things the last thing
[1:05:39] that I would want you to to think
[1:05:41] because this is definitely I'm not here
[1:05:42] to teach you know this is not a
[1:05:44] philosophy class and we're not here to
[1:05:46] teach esoteric philosophy or Eastern
[1:05:49] mysticism we're here to live and move uh
[1:05:53] within the Practical side
[1:05:56] of these mystery truths there are
[1:05:58] mystery truths that are sent and they're
[1:06:01] not just mystical truths but they're but
[1:06:04] they actually come for a practical
[1:06:06] purpose to become from God's thoughts to
[1:06:10] God's word to live life and then you are
[1:06:12] the final voice to the final age does
[1:06:14] that make
[1:06:16] sense so don't ever get so far out there
[1:06:19] that you just dance and glory and shout
[1:06:22] and scream because you've got a lot of
[1:06:23] stimulation from Revelation and out the
[1:06:25] door and never apply
[1:06:27] anything it's not why we're here am it's
[1:06:31] not why we preach we're here to preach
[1:06:34] to transform lives into the
[1:06:37] word amen because you don't come into
[1:06:39] the world anything like the word uh
[1:06:42] you're you're born in sin and so the
[1:06:44] word comes to transform you it's why the
[1:06:46] the Apostle says not to be conformed to
[1:06:49] the world but to be transformed by the
[1:06:51] renewing of Your Mind through the word
[1:06:53] of God so
[1:06:55] so we we have come to him at at his
[1:07:00] invitation we have we have this what
[1:07:02] we've discovered we have come to him at
[1:07:05] at his invitation we came weary and
[1:07:08] heavy laden and he gave us rest in the
[1:07:12] Holy Ghost but we've discovered in our
[1:07:16] series that that that's that that's not
[1:07:19] so we can just kick back put our feet up
[1:07:22] on the desk and go to sleep
[1:07:25] amen or as you've heard me say
[1:07:28] amusingly we are going home on the ship
[1:07:30] of Zion but he didn't tell me go down to
[1:07:32] the docks and sit on my luggage and wait
[1:07:34] for the
[1:07:38] ship see we have come to him can I say
[1:07:42] it like this we have come to him but we
[1:07:46] have come to
[1:07:48] [Music]
[1:07:50] become we've come to become something
[1:07:53] more than we've been
[1:07:56] to learn of him because he said come
[1:07:59] unto me we weary and heavy laden I'll
[1:08:01] give you rest but then he goes to the
[1:08:02] next level now take my yoke upon you
[1:08:05] learn of me and you'll find you not not
[1:08:08] that not that I will just give but you
[1:08:10] shall find rest for your souls so this
[1:08:14] is you on the journey when God has
[1:08:17] brought you to a New Birth it's not just
[1:08:20] okay you're saved see you in heaven the
[1:08:23] whole purpose of Genesis is still to be
[1:08:25] working in your life and bringing you to
[1:08:28] the image of the word amen hallelujah I
[1:08:31] can't explain it more
[1:08:33] clearly so we to learn of him I
[1:08:37] mean why would you learn if not to
[1:08:42] do why would you why would you go to
[1:08:45] school if not to
[1:08:47] become and then and then have see so so
[1:08:52] so we realize then that we have come to
[1:08:55] take take his yoke upon us and continue
[1:08:58] his ministry that's the purpose of why
[1:09:01] he brought you to rest so that you could
[1:09:04] then become like him and then he could
[1:09:07] have sway through your life and then the
[1:09:09] gospel goes
[1:09:12] forward so now this was the last quote
[1:09:14] we read last
[1:09:16] time what a rebuke to Christianity we're
[1:09:19] supposed to represent God and eternal
[1:09:21] life there's only one form of eternal
[1:09:23] life and that's God he alone has eternal
[1:09:26] life and we are products of his because
[1:09:30] we're genes of his spirit that beautiful
[1:09:35] then now is that true then we should
[1:09:38] conduct ourselves women and men like the
[1:09:40] Bible said for us to do not Jezebels on
[1:09:43] the street and Ricky of the organization
[1:09:45] but Christian gentlemen Sons and
[1:09:47] Daughters of God born of the spirit of
[1:09:49] God manifesting the light in our day and
[1:09:52] scattering it that's exactly right see
[1:09:56] all right so now so now when when we
[1:09:59] when we we we're just going to carry on
[1:10:01] you good all right I'm just trying
[1:10:04] to go slow but in a I'm in a
[1:10:09] hurry so so you want to realize friends
[1:10:13] that the gene the Gene's from God it's a
[1:10:16] spiritual Gene It produced his family
[1:10:21] and and we we talked about this how that
[1:10:24] Matthew track the genealogy of Jesus 14
[1:10:28] Generations back you know through the um
[1:10:31] through the through the Captivity and
[1:10:32] then 14 back to David and then 14 on
[1:10:35] back to Abraham and there's 40 some odd
[1:10:38] generations and and we even showed you
[1:10:40] by science that after 20 Generations
[1:10:42] there's almost no perceptible amount of
[1:10:44] you in your in the people of your
[1:10:46] Offspring after 20 generations and he's
[1:10:48] more than double that and yet and yet
[1:10:52] Matthew doesn't call it the generations
[1:10:55] he calls it the
[1:10:57] generation and so we realize that John
[1:11:00] said to an unbelieving generation he
[1:11:02] didn't call them Generations he said you
[1:11:05] Generation of Vipers plural so now sin
[1:11:09] has become generational and the Earth is
[1:11:12] walking around and you've got a
[1:11:13] generation of Jesus Christ and a
[1:11:15] Generation of Vipers and Jesus said to
[1:11:18] those same Generation of Vipers why can
[1:11:21] you not understand my words why do you
[1:11:23] not understand my spech
[1:11:26] because the truth is not in you you're
[1:11:28] of your father the devil he was a liar
[1:11:30] from the beginning that's what you're
[1:11:31] doing you truly show who your origin is
[1:11:36] in so these aren't things that we've
[1:11:39] invented these are things right out of
[1:11:40] the
[1:11:42] scriptures so although in Jesus there
[1:11:45] was no biological DNA of Abraham David
[1:11:49] or Joseph his supposed father there in
[1:11:54] Nazareth um he was no biology of these
[1:11:57] men right and it we don't mean over
[1:12:00] Generations I mean even to the even to
[1:12:02] his day Joseph he had no biology of
[1:12:04] Joseph or
[1:12:06] Mary see amen no physical biology yet
[1:12:11] they were all from Joseph and Mary and
[1:12:16] John and the prophets going back and
[1:12:18] Prophets through captivity and Jeremiah
[1:12:21] and all the way back to David and on
[1:12:22] back to Abraham they were all all every
[1:12:25] last one of them though he had no
[1:12:28] biology of them they were all a part of
[1:12:31] him from the spiritual Gene of God that
[1:12:34] was with God proceeded from God and was
[1:12:37] a part of
[1:12:40] God he was not a descendant of them in
[1:12:43] fact it was just the other way
[1:12:47] around to further blind the unbelievers
[1:12:50] he actually said to them actually before
[1:12:53] Abraham was I am
[1:12:56] amen so he was not the continuation of
[1:13:00] their
[1:13:01] generation they were a part of his
[1:13:04] generation and I just want to say today
[1:13:07] that that generation is my generation
[1:13:10] that family is my family and although I
[1:13:14] share No biology with them but through
[1:13:18] the blood of Jesus Christ by faith in
[1:13:20] the atonement I am joined back through
[1:13:23] Christ to Abraham and I'm part of their
[1:13:27] family because with Abraham it was
[1:13:29] always going to be a faith seed Not
[1:13:32] seeds plural not all israels even
[1:13:35] Israel but it was the faith
[1:13:39] seed so that's good and and that's good
[1:13:42] that I don't share you say well wouldn't
[1:13:45] you like to share biology with David I
[1:13:47] would not amen because I don't want to
[1:13:49] be identified with any of his
[1:13:51] failures I do not want to be identified
[1:13:54] with with Moses losing his Temperance
[1:13:56] striking the rock twice I don't want to
[1:13:58] be identified with Abraham backsliding
[1:14:00] leaving the promised land lying
[1:14:02] twice almost got himself killed almost
[1:14:05] lost his wife I don't want to be a part
[1:14:07] of what David did and Nathan the prophet
[1:14:09] had to confront him I don't want to be a
[1:14:11] part of any of their failures I don't
[1:14:13] want to live throughout all eternity I
[1:14:16] don't want to live through all of
[1:14:18] eternity identified with the failures
[1:14:21] I've
[1:14:22] had oh I'm here to tell you something
[1:14:24] friends I'm rejoicing today that that
[1:14:27] spiritual Gene surpasses and puts away
[1:14:30] every failure that I've ever had in this
[1:14:35] biology
[1:14:38] Hallelujah he says in fact watch this
[1:14:41] let me get it back in in second Samuel
[1:14:44] and David's anger was greatly kindled
[1:14:46] this was when Nathan told him about the
[1:14:48] man who stole another man's single lamb
[1:14:50] David's anger was candled against the
[1:14:52] man and he said to Nathan as the Lord
[1:14:55] liveth the man that hath done this thing
[1:14:57] shall surely die and Nathan said to
[1:15:00] David Thou Art the man thus sayith the
[1:15:03] Lord God of Israel I anointed thee King
[1:15:05] over Israel and I deliver thee out of
[1:15:08] the hand of Saul that's verse 5 verse 7
[1:15:11] check out this one 13 and David said
[1:15:13] unto Nathan I have sinned against the
[1:15:15] Lord and Nathan said unto David the Lord
[1:15:19] hath put away thy sin Thou shalt not die
[1:15:23] oh I'm here to tell you something
[1:15:25] friends David stood there before Nathan
[1:15:28] the prophet and he was absolutely guilty
[1:15:30] of horrible sins and God said your sin
[1:15:34] is put away and and and David was
[1:15:36] Israel's greatest King and he was living
[1:15:39] there he stood living in a lump of
[1:15:42] Fallen biology and that's exactly where
[1:15:45] we have been friends born in a lump of
[1:15:47] Fallen biology but this is not my
[1:15:50] original and this is not my end I'm
[1:15:53] going all the way to revelation 22 I'm
[1:15:55] going to have a new
[1:15:58] body that has never known the mistake or
[1:16:02] the first
[1:16:06] transgression we can't get out of it
[1:16:08] here that brother Caleb was covering
[1:16:11] that Wednesday about the RAM and the
[1:16:13] thick of that's always I remember way
[1:16:15] back in the day when I was young and
[1:16:17] preaching and I I looked at that and I
[1:16:19] started doing the Hebrew look into the
[1:16:22] Hebrew of what does it mean that he's
[1:16:25] he's caught because it's a
[1:16:26] representative of Christ I don't want to
[1:16:28] break the whole thing down it's a sermon
[1:16:30] by itself but he's caught by his horns
[1:16:32] which was the strength of the RAM and
[1:16:35] that's what held Jesus on the cross
[1:16:37] that's what held him they said come down
[1:16:39] and save yourself and save us but had he
[1:16:42] he could have done that but had he saved
[1:16:44] himself he couldn't have saved them you
[1:16:47] understand so what held him on the cross
[1:16:49] was his character and his love for you
[1:16:51] and I when it would have been so much
[1:16:54] easier to take the the the the the you
[1:16:56] know to take the easy street he would
[1:16:58] have still been the Son of God he would
[1:17:00] have still been the Lamb of God that
[1:17:02] wouldn't have changed anything but he
[1:17:04] stayed on the cross because the horn
[1:17:07] held held the RAM and he couldn't get
[1:17:10] free and that was the character of Jesus
[1:17:12] you see the the the fact that he was
[1:17:14] caught in a Thicket that's a Hebrew word
[1:17:17] that means
[1:17:18] interwoven and it it it's what makes a
[1:17:20] garment and so the thicket meant he was
[1:17:23] interwoven because he hadn't started as
[1:17:26] a
[1:17:27] human Oh my he started back in the
[1:17:30] eternities and God said let there be but
[1:17:34] now here he comes and what does he do
[1:17:36] when he was in MDC he what did he do he
[1:17:40] just took some the 16 Earth elements and
[1:17:42] he built a body blew blew it into
[1:17:45] existence and God stepped into it and
[1:17:46] went and met Abraham and Abraham
[1:17:49] worshiped him and God and mikz didn't
[1:17:51] stop him see and El and Abraham even
[1:17:54] called him the almighty God in the
[1:17:56] Hebrew go look that that word that
[1:17:58] Abraham calls him is
[1:18:01] exclusively 100% the the only the
[1:18:05] almighty God is called that Hebrew word
[1:18:08] never does it is it used in any other
[1:18:10] way other than to speak of the almighty
[1:18:13] God and so and when he's done with that
[1:18:16] body what brother Bram said we now we
[1:18:19] don't hear no more of
[1:18:20] MDC because what he do stepped out of
[1:18:23] that body went back to the 16 elements
[1:18:25] and he said later he became Jesus Christ
[1:18:28] now he's the only begotten because he's
[1:18:30] now born of a woman see he's not just a
[1:18:33] created body with God living in it who
[1:18:35] could step in and then step out but now
[1:18:37] he's begotten he's born of a of a woman
[1:18:40] he's caught in a Thicket of humanity and
[1:18:44] he can't just step out he trapped
[1:18:47] himself to go to Calvary for you and me
[1:18:50] Hallelujah friends no I don't want to
[1:18:52] stay in this biology I want to have a
[1:18:54] glory IFI body like under his glorious
[1:18:57] body
[1:19:00] Hallelujah a body where those mistakes
[1:19:02] and failures don't exist in fact have
[1:19:04] never
[1:19:05] existed to where we come to the point
[1:19:08] where we're back like Adam before the
[1:19:10] fall we're made of 16 Earth elements and
[1:19:13] and and even those elements have no sin
[1:19:15] in them in that new World Imagine a body
[1:19:18] that has no sin in it at
[1:19:20] all see so it is this spiritual ual Gene
[1:19:26] that connects me through Christ back to
[1:19:28] David back to Abraham before the
[1:19:31] beginning when and I didn't read it
[1:19:34] again today we read it last time when as
[1:19:36] brother brandham said God stood there on
[1:19:38] this is poetry on the mystical platform
[1:19:41] of the eternities and rolled worlds off
[1:19:44] of his
[1:19:46] hand I was in him
[1:19:50] then he is in me now if if I was in him
[1:19:55] then does it seem strange to you for him
[1:20:00] to say abide in me now if you were in
[1:20:04] him then does it seem strange that he
[1:20:06] would invite you to abide in him now see
[1:20:11] so we are returning to this Immortal
[1:20:13] Life The Immortal Life That's absent of
[1:20:17] oh
[1:20:18] my it it's it's it's as glorious for
[1:20:21] what it doesn't have it's as glorious
[1:20:25] in that way as what it does have I mean
[1:20:28] we're talking about back to an eternal
[1:20:30] life that is and try to try your best to
[1:20:35] just get your mind as close to this as
[1:20:37] you can you won't be able to grasp it
[1:20:38] until you get there but imagine going
[1:20:41] back to a an eternal life and a and a
[1:20:45] body that is absent of any
[1:20:51] concern at all
[1:20:55] there's no anxiety over anything there's
[1:20:59] no stress because there's nothing to be
[1:21:01] stressed
[1:21:03] overl
[1:21:06] see people sometimes as the Bible
[1:21:10] said I told my wife I wasn't going to
[1:21:12] look at that clock today and I just
[1:21:14] did but you'll be okay cuz you know I'm
[1:21:18] not a long preacher I don't and I know
[1:21:20] the whole cowboy statement nothing no
[1:21:22] death worse than being drugged to death
[1:21:23] so we're not going to do that but and
[1:21:25] this is moving fast you good
[1:21:29] amen but the Bible speaks
[1:21:32] about people in God's
[1:21:37] family you say well how do you know it's
[1:21:39] describing people in his family because
[1:21:40] of the last line of the descriptive of
[1:21:43] the
[1:21:44] description and it talks about people in
[1:21:47] God's
[1:21:48] family who have no doubt you know had an
[1:21:52] experience with the Lord
[1:21:54] but
[1:21:57] they but they they they're not
[1:22:01] diligent and allowing God to have
[1:22:05] control of every aspect of their
[1:22:08] life and they keep
[1:22:10] trying to build their own life and just
[1:22:14] close enough to not make God mad let me
[1:22:16] just kind of just get that part I just
[1:22:18] kind of really want that part Lord you
[1:22:20] okay don't don't hit me with lightning
[1:22:25] and it talks about people who
[1:22:27] build their entire life over
[1:22:31] years
[1:22:33] decades and they come to the end of
[1:22:36] their life and the sad reality for them
[1:22:39] is that they've built out of wood hay
[1:22:41] and
[1:22:43] stubble now they were supposed to build
[1:22:45] out of Gold Silver and precious stones
[1:22:48] yes and I'm not saying they haven't
[1:22:50] known the Lord I'm not saying they
[1:22:52] haven't had a true experience with the
[1:22:53] Lord
[1:22:55] I'm just saying that and you say well
[1:22:57] then how do you know that's God's family
[1:22:58] because in the end it says that it
[1:23:01] describes and I'm not going to read it
[1:23:02] today but it describes how that when the
[1:23:04] trials and the fiery things come and the
[1:23:06] judgments of God their whole life burns
[1:23:08] down and everything they've
[1:23:10] built and invested in yet they
[1:23:13] themselves will be
[1:23:15] saved
[1:23:16] see yet so we're talking about a person
[1:23:18] who in the end is still saved but they
[1:23:21] built their life on wood hay and stubble
[1:23:24] and instead of the Tre precious
[1:23:26] Treasures of God's word oh I'm here to
[1:23:29] tell you something friends that is not
[1:23:32] supposed to be the plight of the child
[1:23:34] of God don't build your life on wood hay
[1:23:37] and stubble chasing the American dream
[1:23:40] the the world dream the global dream
[1:23:42] some political dream some scientific
[1:23:45] dream surrender everything you have to
[1:23:48] Christ and say come into my life take
[1:23:51] completely
[1:23:52] over amen
[1:23:55] and build your life don't build it on
[1:23:57] something that'll just burn down in the
[1:23:59] end and you'll it'll come back to haunt
[1:24:02] you amen it'll come back and things will
[1:24:05] come back in your life and you'll say
[1:24:07] Lord why are you letting me why are you
[1:24:09] making me go through this he was tried
[1:24:11] to prevent you from go going through it
[1:24:14] amen see now in case you didn't know
[1:24:17] God's family could make that mistake now
[1:24:19] you
[1:24:20] know
[1:24:23] am you know know I I think about that
[1:24:26] that those cares and you know and I and
[1:24:29] and I and I don't mean this as a segue I
[1:24:32] want to speak about the the last
[1:24:33] conversation I had with my dad and I'm
[1:24:35] not talking about a man who did that who
[1:24:36] built out of Woodhead and stuball I want
[1:24:38] to make that clear my dad was the
[1:24:39] greatest man I ever
[1:24:41] knew but it it just in my memory I was
[1:24:45] thinking about the last conversation
[1:24:47] that I ever got to have with him before
[1:24:49] he was intubated never could speak again
[1:24:51] and he went down from there and on down
[1:24:52] and on out and uh he's now in a young
[1:24:55] body living in
[1:24:59] glory and you know he had
[1:25:02] concerns and his concerns were for his
[1:25:06] wife and his youngest son and really at
[1:25:10] that point I can tell you brother Eddie
[1:25:12] had no other
[1:25:14] concerns he had already told me he said
[1:25:16] you know Jason he said when I was 64 he
[1:25:19] said I had to have triple bypass heart
[1:25:21] surgery he said when they were rolling
[1:25:24] me back to to go under he said I kissed
[1:25:26] your mother goodbye I remember that I
[1:25:28] still remember
[1:25:30] that and he says and he said when they
[1:25:33] said Mr Watkins now they put that over
[1:25:34] his face we're going to count you
[1:25:36] backwards he said I laid there thinking
[1:25:39] I do not know if I'll wake up still on
[1:25:42] this side or on the other side But
[1:25:45] whichever happens it'll be
[1:25:48] fine and he said to me he said now I
[1:25:50] don't know now here he is he's he's he's
[1:25:52] he's two months away he's he's only got
[1:25:54] about 2 months to live now we're not
[1:25:56] believing for that we're hoping and tray
[1:25:58] praying and trusting but that was God's
[1:25:59] plan when Genesis 1:1 was written
[1:26:03] amen and he said now I don't know what
[1:26:05] the outcome of this will be son he said
[1:26:08] but I just want to tell you however it
[1:26:10] turns out it'll be
[1:26:12] fine and those who knew brother Eddie he
[1:26:14] would just always throw his hand up
[1:26:16] fine it's
[1:26:19] fine you couldn't threaten him because
[1:26:21] he'd go fine
[1:26:25] knock yourself out you know and so so he
[1:26:29] that that you don't know what a treasure
[1:26:31] that has been to me to have to have him
[1:26:33] look me in the eye and I knew when I
[1:26:34] preached this funeral I would see him
[1:26:36] again but it it it weighed upon me as I
[1:26:39] was studying this sermon I thought you
[1:26:40] know what a glorious position my dad was
[1:26:43] in because at that point somehow he was
[1:26:47] he I think he suspected he might be
[1:26:49] close and suddenly all the cares of life
[1:26:53] and all the raro and all the rat race
[1:26:56] and the the rat race we enter to try to
[1:26:58] win it and we win it we're still a rat
[1:27:00] and and all the troubles and trials and
[1:27:03] hardships and heartaches suddenly they
[1:27:04] meant very little to brother Eddie and
[1:27:06] he just said if I wake up on the other
[1:27:08] side it'll be just fine he only had a
[1:27:10] concern for his wife and his son and I
[1:27:12] and once I alleviated that I said dad
[1:27:14] you don't have to worry I said me me and
[1:27:16] the boys I said we we'll take care of
[1:27:18] Mom she'll never want for nothing and me
[1:27:20] and my sons will gather and and they and
[1:27:22] we do it and they do it and
[1:27:24] daughter-in-laws take care of sister
[1:27:26] Jean and and and I said and I'll even uh
[1:27:29] make up with Nathan and I'll try to help
[1:27:30] him and then the Lord ended up taking
[1:27:32] him later because the Lord couldn't get
[1:27:34] him to to repent but yet he was a son
[1:27:37] yeah just like just like Saul in the
[1:27:39] Bible and so so I I thought to myself
[1:27:43] that is this why what what I was
[1:27:47] witnessing of of my dad is this why had
[1:27:51] he found that secret that not only only
[1:27:54] had he come weary and heavy laden years
[1:27:57] ago and found rest but had he also
[1:28:01] learned of this Messiah had he taken his
[1:28:05] yoke upon him and now coming to the end
[1:28:07] of his life this life meant very little
[1:28:10] after almost 80 Earth years all it
[1:28:12] mattered to him was take care of my wife
[1:28:15] your mom take care of your brother and
[1:28:16] I'm going on to glory and I'll see you
[1:28:18] on the other side oh that's the
[1:28:21] invitation to all of us today and you
[1:28:23] don't have to wait till you've been here
[1:28:24] 80 Earth years to come to that come unto
[1:28:28] me all ye that are weary and heavy
[1:28:30] lighten and I'll give you rest for your
[1:28:32] souls take my yoke upon you learn of
[1:28:37] me you shall find rest for your
[1:28:42] souls I think that this is exactly
[1:28:46] why Jesus invites us to
[1:28:51] this let me come to my last slide
[1:28:56] I quoted this for you a little bit ago
[1:28:58] go off and
[1:29:00] on oh uh yeah let me go off and on then
[1:29:02] back on and then switch Advance it for
[1:29:05] me it should or no I'm yeah uh Advance
[1:29:08] all the way to the very last slide to
[1:29:11] the very last one we're GNA bypass
[1:29:15] those right there Isaiah
[1:29:20] 5511 you good amen and I'm turning a
[1:29:23] coin for the Finish Line you good can I
[1:29:27] have you 10 more minutes you'll keep
[1:29:28] your
[1:29:29] focus so shall my word be that goeth
[1:29:35] forth out of my mouth it shall not
[1:29:39] that's definitive that's definite it
[1:29:42] shall not return unto me void but it
[1:29:47] shall not maybe not probably not
[1:29:50] hopefully it not if you cooperate it
[1:29:54] shall accomplish that which I please and
[1:29:59] it shall prosper in the thing wherein to
[1:30:04] I sent
[1:30:06] it I'm coming to a part that I've been
[1:30:09] trying to get to since probably part
[1:30:15] three as
[1:30:19] Believers we can all look each
[1:30:22] other in the eye and be
[1:30:25] honest and admit that
[1:30:29] sometimes as
[1:30:31] Believers we find ourselves at
[1:30:35] distance from the holy spirit's
[1:30:39] influence in our daily lives
[1:30:43] amen the ham as I would say grinds and
[1:30:49] ruts of daily living day after day and
[1:30:54] sometimes this is this is what happens
[1:30:56] this is what I observe in my own life
[1:30:58] and this is what I observe as a
[1:31:00] minister sometimes I can see God's
[1:31:02] family get into this point and day after
[1:31:05] day leads to weeks which leads to months
[1:31:08] and if left unchecked I've seen it go
[1:31:11] for
[1:31:12] years where I know someone is a child of
[1:31:15] God I have every confidence and I know
[1:31:19] that they love the Lord and they really
[1:31:21] do it's for real and they believe the
[1:31:23] the word for real and it's not just
[1:31:27] persuasion they actually have a divine
[1:31:30] revelation and they they're marching to
[1:31:32] Zion they have absolutely come to him
[1:31:35] and found rest in the Holy
[1:31:38] Spirit but sometimes we have to admit
[1:31:41] that we find ourselves at distance from
[1:31:45] him and we find ourselves standing too
[1:31:48] far away from the Lord and needing to
[1:31:52] get back yes how many have had that I'll
[1:31:56] raise up both
[1:31:58] mine we wonder what happened to those
[1:32:02] early days when our experience in the
[1:32:06] Lord felt fresh and meaningful and we
[1:32:09] long for the Revival back to those days
[1:32:14] that we had with the master and we're
[1:32:16] very sincere in
[1:32:18] it we we we we we make you know we have
[1:32:22] fits and starts and but but too often we
[1:32:25] we we find ourselves struggling for the
[1:32:28] progress we hope for am I am I speaking
[1:32:31] to real people
[1:32:32] today sometimes we we just find
[1:32:34] ourselves I want to be more than I am
[1:32:36] but I'm
[1:32:38] struggling and I wonder if we're brave
[1:32:41] enough to admit that
[1:32:44] sometimes sometimes we get ourselves too
[1:32:47] far away from the Lord uh and and I just
[1:32:51] need the Lord to come down and do
[1:32:54] something in
[1:32:55] me sometimes we need can I just say it
[1:32:58] like that sometimes we we just need the
[1:33:00] Lord to just come do
[1:33:02] it and I I'm trying and I'm I'm not
[1:33:06] making it I'm struggling and I'm
[1:33:07] stumbling but I keep trying and tomorrow
[1:33:09] I'll try again Lord I'll never quit I'll
[1:33:11] never stop but I I I want to make
[1:33:13] progress I Used to Know You in a greater
[1:33:16] way I used to have your spirit wrapping
[1:33:18] around me I used to be able to pray like
[1:33:20] I so unfed what happened to those early
[1:33:23] days
[1:33:24] amen oh friends now that makes us feel
[1:33:27] bad that makes us feel bad that we have
[1:33:30] to say Lord just come and do it but can
[1:33:33] I suggest to you today isn't that what
[1:33:36] he did when he first found you you
[1:33:39] couldn't save yourself you couldn't come
[1:33:41] to him but he came down he did it
[1:33:44] himself and he reached further down than
[1:33:47] I could reach my hand up to him and I
[1:33:49] want you to know today friends that the
[1:33:51] same thing he did then you knew it was
[1:33:54] him and you knew you couldn't do it and
[1:33:56] he reached down and you you took a hold
[1:33:58] of his hand and maybe that would be the
[1:34:01] Cry of your heart today after 10
[1:34:04] installments of abiding me to say Lord I
[1:34:07] want to abide I want to come higher than
[1:34:10] I've been you should know by now that
[1:34:12] there's another
[1:34:13] level amen oh Hallelujah and maybe that
[1:34:18] would be your cry maybe this entire
[1:34:20] Series has been tailored by the Holy
[1:34:23] Ghost host just for you can I say to you

[1:34:31] cry out to him and just say Lord I'm

[1:34:36] you stand to your feet and just lift up
[1:34:38] hands and say Lord I'm going to throw
[1:34:40] down my pride and I'm going to raise up
[1:34:42] my hands and I'm going to say I need
[1:34:44] thee Oh I need thee every hour I need

[1:35:08] again will he not come to you now I tell
[1:35:12] you he will come do you know why he will
[1:35:15] come because he will not see his word
[1:35:19] remain void and he sent his word and
[1:35:22] you're a part of his word and you will
[1:35:24] not return to him void you will come
[1:35:28] back in that perfect condition and I
[1:35:30] just say today Lord God whatever you
[1:35:32] have to do bring me under the opes of
[1:35:35] that promise let that word be a governor

[1:36:15] being who
[1:36:17] filled all time and
[1:36:21] space will come to you right
[1:36:25] now I have labored and preached my heart
[1:36:29] out these 10 straight we started back at
[1:36:33] the end of last
[1:36:35] year and God has just held me to it and
[1:36:41] every time I would think I would get
[1:36:42] near the end I was telling you we were
[1:36:44] at the end after part three and then it
[1:36:46] just kept coming and it kept coming and
[1:36:49] I said Lord am I not getting it are we
[1:36:50] not getting it and it wasn't that it
[1:36:52] wasn't God being repetitions these 10
[1:36:54] parts are not just a repetition of all
[1:36:56] of of itself we have journeyed friends

[1:37:07] time space and Eternity he'll bring you
[1:37:09] up into his
[1:37:11] orbit why will he because he will not
[1:37:15] allow his word to return to him void he

[1:37:37] coldness in your spirit he'll come to
[1:37:39] you he'll come all the way from Glory I
[1:37:41] think about how that that brother
[1:37:44] Brandon talks about that when he stepped
[1:37:46] out of Eternity he said he'll step from
[1:37:48] the eternities to you today just like he
[1:37:51] stepped from the eternities and came and
[1:37:53] took the book he'll step out of the
[1:37:55] eternities and he'll meet you today
[1:37:58] Hallelujah friends do you love
[1:38:01] him I have
[1:38:04] had many
[1:38:07] days just let it be a stepping stone of
[1:38:10] encouragement to you I have had many
[1:38:13] days
[1:38:15] where I felt too far from him say how
[1:38:20] many of those days you had brother Jason
[1:38:22] too many right too
[1:38:26] many but I'm
