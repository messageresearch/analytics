[6:59] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, I have a couple of
[7:01] prayer requests,
[7:02] but I have a little thought that I
[7:04] wanted to share with you that I had when
[7:06] um we went hiking [music] up in North
[7:09] Carolina last weekend.
[7:11] And um I was thinking about Enoch,
[7:15] you know, where the Bible says he walked
[7:17] with God and he was not cuz God took
[7:19] him. And you know, in my mind, many
[7:22] times I'm thinking like he's out there
[7:24] all alone walking some beautiful
[7:27] wilderness road where there's nothing
[7:30] around. And um but you know, it was
[7:34] probably I and I [music] called it the
[7:35] Enoch trail, which is a trail I want to
[7:38] be on because um I like the end result.
[7:42] Amen. I want God to take me. But, you
[7:45] know, he had kids, had wife, children,
[7:48] probably had grandkids, too,
[7:51] lived a life just like you and I do.
[7:55] And that's so I want to walk to where
[7:57] God takes me. Amen. The Enoch Trail. I
[8:02] have two prayer requests from Brother
[8:04] Kevin.
[8:06] Uh Dave Ward, a 10-year-old boy. Now,
[8:09] can you imagine with cancer?
[8:13] [music] He is starting more treatment
[8:14] tomorrow. Praying for him and family. He
[8:17] needs a miracle.
[8:19] Davian Wartz, you want to remember that.
[8:22] And then [music]
[8:23] Jess Martin,
[8:25] wife of a deputy,
[8:27] kidney issues.
[8:39] We'll be starting dialysis immediately,
[8:41] I believe.
[8:43] I understand [music] she needs a kidney
[8:45] transplant.
[8:47] Of course, you know, that hit home.
[8:49] There's some a teacher that no longer is
[8:52] teaching with Melissa because [music]
[8:53] she has breast cancer. She's going
[8:55] through treatment. You know, I have um
[8:59] I have a uh the grandmother of my
[9:02] grandkids on the other side. She's she's
[9:05] in [music] her second round of cancer
[9:07] treatment for breast cancer. So, we just
[9:10] want to remember these. You know, these
[9:11] [music] people, Miss Barnes,
[9:14] they're looking at you and me and
[9:17] anybody that has faith to touch the
[9:19] throne of God for their sickness. So, we
[9:23] want to pray for them this morning.
[9:25] Let's pray.
[9:27] Father, I love you this morning, Lord.
[9:30] And I am so grateful, Father, that you
[9:32] have made a way that [music] we can come
[9:34] to you. The scripture says that because
[9:38] you bend down, I will pray. So I look to
[9:42] you this morning, these requests, I
[9:44] can't perform some miracle of a scalpel
[9:49] and things like that. A 10-year-old
[9:50] [music] boy, Father.
[9:54] Lord, I pray I lift him up before you in
[9:56] the name of Jesus Christ
[9:59] fighting cancer. Father,
[10:01] Lord, we know there's a life there. We
[10:04] come against that life that is [music]
[10:06] affecting those cells. In the name of
[10:08] Jesus Christ, we pray that you would as
[10:11] our brother requested is saying [music]
[10:13] he needs a miracle. And we know that
[10:16] you're a miracle working God this
[10:17] morning
[10:20] for Jess. [music] Martin, father,
[10:23] his wife.
[10:27] Lord, I pray for her kidney issues,
[10:30] [music] starting dialysis.
[10:32] What a trial.
[10:35] I pray that you would touch her body,
[10:37] Lord. If she has to continue to go this
[10:40] way, I pray that you would help her
[10:41] every step of the way. But I pray in the
[10:44] name of Jesus Christ, Lord, that you
[10:46] would just intervene.
[10:49] Touch her kidneys, [music] Father. Touch
[10:50] her body. Help her husband this morning,
[10:54] this day.
[10:56] Help him to help take care of her. Help
[10:58] whatever goes through that family. I
[11:00] pray I lift him up before you, Father.
[11:03] Lord, we rejoice that we have an
[11:05] advocate, a healer,
[11:09] Father, that we can come to [music]
[11:10] today
[11:12] that paid the full price and we believe
[11:14] it. We accept it. We pray for these
[11:16] [music] people, Lord. Those that are on
[11:18] the hearts of the people today, we pray
[11:20] for them, Father.
[11:22] We love and worship you. And as we
[11:24] collect the tithes and offerings, I
[11:25] [music] pray that you would bless the
[11:27] cheerful giver. Father, we thank you
[11:29] abundantly with grateful hearts for the
[11:32] body that you give us in Jesus name.
[11:34] Amen.

[40:03] Give the Lord a hand of worship and
[40:06] praise. [music]
[40:07] Amen.
[40:10] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[40:10] &gt;&gt; You know, I never want to think of
[40:12] [music] that as a as just a dry ritual.
[40:16] I think the Lord is worthy of all the
[40:17] praise we [music] can give him. You
[40:19] could stand here for an hour with
[40:22] thunderous applause to him and you
[40:24] wouldn't scratch the surface of his
[40:26] worth. [music]
[40:27] Amen. I want to talk a little bit about
[40:29] ritualistic things today. So, ritualism
[40:33] as it were. Um, I'm going to invite you
[40:36] into the scriptures straight away, uh,
[40:38] to Isaiah 29. And while you're finding
[40:40] your place in Isaiah 29, like to just
[40:44] make a couple of quick announcements and
[40:46] we got a prayer request that got sent in
[40:47] for Sister Lauren. Um,
[40:52] Amen. Happy to our visitors here with
[40:54] us. God bless you. We're happy to have
[40:55] you here with us today, man. Trust
[40:57] you'll enjoy the presence of the Lord.
[41:00] Amen. In the uh, camp of the King. Amen.
[41:03] Praise God.
[41:04] Hallelujah.
[41:07] Our um our winter meetings are
[41:09] officially set. We've been kind of
[41:11] mentioning it along as we go. They're
[41:14] set for the second weekend of December,
[41:17] December 12, 13, and 14.
[41:21] and Sunday. On Friday the 12th, the
[41:24] service will begin at 700 p.m. And um
[41:28] and then on Saturday the 13th, we're
[41:31] looking to make that an all day event of
[41:35] special activities. Um kind of like what
[41:38] we have had in the past with our harvest
[41:41] fest and uh we our youth camp has kind
[41:43] of crowded that out a little bit. So,
[41:46] we're [clears throat] going to try to
[41:47] combine that as we've did in the past
[41:50] with special ministry and coming in. We
[41:52] want to make it all word-based and
[41:54] focused around the word of God. I'm not
[41:56] looking to celebrate a man-made holiday.
[41:58] Amen. But, um, but that's going to be
[42:01] Saturday the 13th. It'll be an all day
[42:03] event of special activities. It'll begin
[42:06] with, and this is an announcement for
[42:08] here, but also on the internet, they'll
[42:10] hear it. Um, Saturday will begin with a
[42:14] minister's breakfast. Um, followed um
[42:18] later, Brother Aaron McGary will be with
[42:20] us, him and his family. Amen. And
[42:23] they're we're looking forward to having
[42:24] them with us. Haven't had him here in a
[42:26] while. Amen. So, um, looking forward to
[42:29] that. He'll be speaking at the ministers
[42:31] breakfast. And then Saturday,
[42:34] um
[42:36] there'll be um that so there'll be a
[42:38] minister's breakfast on Saturday
[42:41] followed by family and children
[42:42] activities
[42:44] beginning in the early afternoon. We
[42:46] haven't yet determined with certainty a
[42:49] location that's still we're still
[42:51] working on the best solution for that.
[42:54] [clears throat] But uh at any rate,
[42:56] that'll begin in the early afternoon.
[42:57] There'll be food and fellowship and a
[42:58] bonfire in the evening. There'll be no
[43:01] evening service per se. It'll be all day
[43:03] activities and in the evening we'll have
[43:05] a bonfire with singing and worship and
[43:09] brother Aaron will give us a fireside
[43:11] address at that time. Sunday then of
[43:14] course will begin uh at our usual times
[43:16] and we'll make further announcements
[43:19] concerning um the midweek service
[43:22] leading up to that. Uh the Sunday school
[43:24] classes on that Sunday. We'll figure all
[43:27] that out and get our ducks in a row on
[43:29] that. decide well how we want to go
[43:30] forward and we'll be sure to let you
[43:33] know that uh all updates and reminders
[43:35] and announcements will go out in our
[43:38] churchwide WhatsApp chat. So just be
[43:40] monitoring that. We'll make continued
[43:42] announcements as we go along. So anyone
[43:44] listening online who would like to come
[43:46] be a part of that weekend with us.
[43:47] You're certainly welcome and invited uh
[43:50] to be with us. Amen. Any family, friends
[43:52] that you'd like to bring, Amen. That'd
[43:55] be wonderful. bring them to the house of
[43:56] God and we'll fill them up with
[43:58] spiritual food and natural food and
[44:00] fellowship and Amen. slap them enough
[44:02] times on the back, knock all the devil
[44:04] in the world out of them. [laughter]
[44:08] Amen. Praise the Lord. Um, Brother Don
[44:12] sent in a prayer request for sister
[44:15] Lauren. Said she pulled a muscle in her
[44:17] shoulder two days ago. She may have a
[44:19] pinched nerve or something. This morning
[44:21] she's in excruciating pain. I'm taking
[44:24] her to urgent care clinic to try
[44:27] [clears throat] to help her. So, he's
[44:28] asking, excuse me, for prayer for that.
[44:31] Praise the Lord.
[44:34] In Isaiah, we're just going to read one
[44:38] verse. I'm not going to be able to read
[44:40] Isaiah out of Jeremiah, will I?
[44:43] &gt;&gt; [clears throat]
[44:43] &gt;&gt; In Isaiah 29, we're going to read one um
[44:47] verse here and we will let you be seated
[44:50] and then we'll go to prayer and take up
[44:53] this prayer request for our sister.
[44:56] [clears throat]
[44:58] Amen. Praise the Lord. Isaiah 29:13.
[45:06] Wherefore the Lord said,
[45:09] "For as much as this people draw near me
[45:13] with their mouth, and with their lips do
[45:16] honor me, but have removed [snorts]
[45:20] their hearts far from me, and their fear
[45:23] toward me [clears throat] is taught by
[45:26] the precept of men." So that's just a a
[45:30] [snorts] way of in Old Testament
[45:32] language of saying you've let men
[45:34] explain away the value of what I've said
[45:36] in my word. And you've determined that
[45:39] your fear, your admiration, your awe,
[45:42] your respect toward me is you've decided
[45:45] to base it on not what I've said, but
[45:48] what men tell you.
[45:50] &gt;&gt; And [clears throat] so this was a real
[45:52] problem for the Lord. Amen. Let's let's
[45:55] bow our heads.
[45:57] Master, we come to you in thanksgiving
[45:59] today for the word that's been read, the
[46:03] songs that have been sung, the people
[46:04] are gathered. All things are ready now,
[46:07] Lord, to hear from you in your word. We
[46:10] pray that you will as you have blessed
[46:13] your word in the speaking of the word,
[46:15] the reading of the word, the hearing of
[46:17] it read. May you also bless the speaker
[46:20] and the listening audience today as we
[46:22] are here Lord not to impart our own
[46:25] thinking but [clears throat] only as you
[46:28] have led us in through the word of God.
[46:30] May we deliver that Lord today purely
[46:34] and we commit it to you now Lord. We
[46:37] turn and ask mercy for our sister Lauren
[46:40] in excruciating pain. Lord, [snorts] I
[46:43] those kinds of injuries many of us know
[46:46] all too well. And we're asking for your
[46:48] mercy now for our sister right now.
[46:50] Lord, may the healing hand of Christ lay
[46:53] upon her and touch her and recover her.
[46:55] May she know, Lord, that temporary
[46:59] resurrection power today and set the
[47:01] matter right. I pray you'll grant it.
[47:04] Commit this now to you and all of us
[47:06] here together, one and all in Jesus
[47:08] name. Amen. God bless you, friends. You
[47:10] can be seated.
[47:12] &gt;&gt; [clears throat]
[47:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. I see a number of visitors from
[47:17] family members are here. We're happy to
[47:19] have you all in the house of God.
[47:28] [snorts] Um I'm going to invite you with
[47:31] me to that little tiny book of Habach.
[47:33] It's not an easy book to find. If you uh
[47:37] hit Malachi and go back about four
[47:38] books, four or five books I think maybe
[47:41] four books prior to Malachi, you'll run
[47:43] into this small prophet of Habach.
[47:46] [clears throat]
[47:49] I want to continue today and hopefully
[47:52] we'll be able to conclude this series on
[47:54] Lucifer's counter claim. This will be
[47:56] the fifth installment as I remember
[48:00] um Habachok chapter 2
[48:04] and we'll catch these first three
[48:07] verses.
[48:09] I will stand upon my watch and set me
[48:13] upon the tower
[48:15] and I will watch to see what he will say
[48:18] unto me and what I shall answer when I
[48:21] am reproved.
[48:23] And the Lord answered me and said,
[48:26] "Write the vision, and make it plain
[48:29] upon tables, that he may run that
[48:32] readeth it. For the vision is yet for an
[48:35] appointed time,
[48:38] [clears throat] but at the end it shall
[48:40] speak and not lie. Though it tar, wait
[48:45] for it, because it will surely come,
[48:48] [clears throat] it will not tarry." So
[48:51] you know God is simply saying what you
[48:55] think of it as carrying is not what God
[48:58] thinks of it as carrying you know and we
[49:00] have a similar language used in the New
[49:03] Testament by the apostles I think it's
[49:05] either um either James or perhaps John
[49:08] that how that you know he that he that's
[49:11] coming he will not tarry
[49:14] &gt;&gt; and he's coming and and yet here we are
[49:17] 2,000 years latermen
[49:20] um seven church ages contiguous and
[49:24] continuous
[49:25] uh and and we've even went beyond God
[49:29] dealing with the last age dealing with
[49:33] the church. And so now and and that's on
[49:36] the church. That's not on Christ because
[49:39] Christ was busy walking in the middle of
[49:41] seven lampstands and um and he said, you
[49:45] know, I'll never leave you nor forsake
[49:46] you. It's the church that booted him out
[49:49] at the last day. Uniquely, ironically,
[49:51] and and it's a it's a unique age that
[49:54] had never really happened where in all
[49:57] 2,000 years of church history, Christian
[49:59] church history, that you would finally
[50:01] come down to the end of it all and put
[50:04] Christ out of the church. And and that's
[50:07] where you are uh [clears throat] you
[50:09] have so much self argrandisement, you
[50:11] have so much self-worth, you have so
[50:14] much self uh confidence, so much
[50:16] self-righteousness
[50:18] that you just you you know the age
[50:20] finally that says God, we have need of
[50:23] nothing.
[50:24] We're rich. We're increased with goods.
[50:26] We don't even need you. And so we're
[50:29] quite uh able to handle this on our own.
[50:32] Thank you. You can be excused. And so,
[50:35] you know, Christ is put on the outside
[50:37] of the church. And this is why brother
[50:40] Brandham would say and and you know,
[50:42] people uh it amuses me sometimes, you
[50:46] know, they want to disagree with William
[50:48] Brandom on things he would say and yet
[50:50] everything he's saying is right out of
[50:52] the scriptures and you fall on your face
[50:54] trying to prove it wrong and it doesn't
[50:57] end well. And I've I've I've been, you
[50:59] know, carrying this gospel, this message
[51:01] to six of the seven continents of the
[51:04] earth. And I've never found anyone yet
[51:06] who could take anything that we hold
[51:08] dear in the message ranks and things
[51:10] that a prophet brought us that can be
[51:12] disproven by the Bible. People, I'm not
[51:15] saying they can't make a case and make
[51:16] an argument, but at the end of the day,
[51:19] I know what works. I I can see results.
[51:22] See, so you we can all have an opinion,
[51:24] but how about we stick with what
[51:26] actually turns people into this?
[51:29] &gt;&gt; How about WE DECIDE TO ABANDON the
[51:31] things that cause people to go away from
[51:33] this? To now, to us, that seems simple.
[51:36] And you'd think the whole world would
[51:38] see that. But yet, we know the world
[51:41] [clears throat] in mass does not see
[51:43] that. And the Bible says they wouldn't,
[51:45] and they don't. The Bible says they
[51:48] would not and they would go to their
[51:50] destruction believing the lie and and
[51:54] not only uh believing a lie and that's a
[51:58] result of them closing their own eyes
[52:00] against truth they did that to
[52:01] themselves and and God just simply says
[52:04] you know since you did that since you
[52:06] didn't want my thinking in your thinking
[52:08] well then have at it go ahead knock
[52:12] yourself out I'll just turn you over to
[52:14] a repate mind and you'll believe a lie
[52:16] and be damned by it. And brother
[52:18] Brandham goes back through the Greek and
[52:19] Aramaic language to prove definitively
[52:22] that that term believe a lie is to
[52:24] believe the original lie.
[52:27] &gt;&gt; See the the lie that they're believing
[52:29] is not just a random lie. It's the
[52:31] original lie. And the original lie was
[52:34] that the original lie it's it you can't
[52:38] sum it up almost in a single sentence.
[52:40] The original lie was basically this,
[52:43] that you don't have to obey all of God's
[52:46] word.
[52:47] &gt;&gt; That was the original lie.
[52:49] &gt;&gt; That God's word can be compromised. That
[52:52] God's word can you can have a watered
[52:55] down version of God's word. You can keep
[52:57] 99% of it and you're only MISSING 1% AND
[53:01] GOD'S OKAY WITH THAT. That's not true.
[53:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:05] &gt;&gt; Say, "Oh, it'll be okay." No, it it
[53:07] WON'T BE OKAY. OH, IT DOESN'T MATTER.
[53:09] OH, IT MATTERS.
[53:11] &gt;&gt; And the Bible prophesies, not that we
[53:13] decided anything. The Bible prophesies
[53:16] that the world would go in mass that
[53:19] there would only be a very few that
[53:20] would find the straight and narrow path
[53:22] that leads to eternal life. And it's not
[53:25] on God. It's on the human that made that
[53:28] conscious choice because God gives every
[53:30] human being that's ever been born a
[53:33] legit opportunity to save himself from
[53:35] destruction. And so, you know, we've
[53:38] we've mentioned to you many times before
[53:40] the the atheist loves to point to
[53:42] scriptures like God hardening Pharaoh's
[53:44] heart, but I've already shown you many
[53:47] times and five or six times the Bible
[53:49] says that before Pharaoh ever that
[53:51] before God ever hardened his heart, five
[53:53] or six times prior to that, Pharaoh
[53:55] hardened his own heart. See, and you
[53:57] say, "Well, God blinded them." Well, the
[54:00] the true Jews that God blinded get are
[54:04] are given white robes under the fifth
[54:05] seal. YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT
[54:06] THEM. GOD'S got them. See? AND SO SO
[54:10] IT'S THOSE who who literally Jesus said,
[54:13] "You closed your own eyes."
[54:17] See? So you're not going to impugn God
[54:20] with unrighteousness or unfairness or
[54:22] injustice. As I've said so many times,
[54:25] when you read the the the
[54:27] stenographers's report of the judgment
[54:29] bar, you don't really get that in
[54:30] Revelation. Revelation is kind of an
[54:32] overview. The the heavens peel back like
[54:34] a scroll. The the the the sea gives up
[54:37] its dead. The dead, both small and
[54:39] great, stand before him. The books are
[54:41] open. And another book is open called
[54:42] the book of life. And the people are
[54:43] judged from the books. But you don't get
[54:45] a you DON'T GET ANY OF the dialogue like
[54:47] a court's stenographers's record that
[54:50] keeps record of everything that the
[54:51] judge says and the witnesses say and the
[54:53] people say. You have to go to Matthew 25
[54:55] to get that. And uh and and so you know
[54:58] when you when you read the details of
[55:00] the judgment as I've pointed out for
[55:02] years now there is no one going away.
[55:06] THERE'S A SLIGHT OBJECTION. HEY DON'T WE
[55:08] GET eternal life? Well, you know, we
[55:11] preached in your name and we did all
[55:13] THESE MIGHTY WORKS. AND AND THE JUDGE,
[55:15] the king will just say to them, "Yeah,
[55:17] but but you did it in iniquity. Your
[55:20] hearts were never converted. You you did
[55:22] that trying to trying to earn your way
[55:25] in, trying to use your works to convince
[55:27] me that you're that you're a real that
[55:29] you were a real Christian." And I guess
[55:30] THAT MAKES SENSE. WHY wouldn't they do
[55:32] that? They had spent their whole life
[55:33] doing that,
[55:34] &gt;&gt; trying to convince people they were a
[55:36] Christian because of their good works.
[55:38] So why wouldn't they present that to the
[55:40] judge as a last line of defense? But
[55:42] once that once that gets uh put down by
[55:45] the judge, by the king, then the people
[55:48] go away quietly to their destruction.
[55:50] There's no marching, there's no signs,
[55:52] there's no rioting, there's no there's
[55:55] no uprising, you know, nobody's uh
[55:57] marching and and chanting. it. They just
[55:59] they just quietly go to their fate
[56:02] because they know I promise you at that
[56:04] moment you can hide behind hypocrisy all
[56:07] day long, but at that moment there's
[56:09] nowhere to hide. You can't even hide
[56:10] behind your own self-righteousness.
[56:12] There is a knowing in the presence of
[56:14] that judge that you are guilty. I would
[56:17] to God that the presence of that judge
[56:19] be here today to show you now you're
[56:21] guilty. You need to repent. You need to
[56:24] give YOUR LIFE TO CHRIST. DON'T WAIT
[56:26] TILL YOU GET THERE. Then we are all
[56:28] going to stand before the judgment seat
[56:30] of Christ, Paul said, and give an
[56:32] account for our deeds whether they're
[56:33] good or bad. The question is not will I
[56:36] stand at his judgment seat. The question
[56:38] is when will I and where will I? And
[56:40] since this IS HIS JUDGMENT SEAT, I
[56:42] CHOOSE HERE AND NOW. I DON'T WANT TO GO
[56:45] WHILE THERE'S MERCY HERE and now. I
[56:46] don't want to go there and then when
[56:48] there's no mercy.
[56:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; These are rudimentary things we've
[56:53] taught on many times before here. But
[56:56] when you when you look at Habachok's
[56:58] prophecy,
[57:00] you know, this is um this is this is a
[57:04] time that that you know a lot of the
[57:06] prophecies are are coming to pass and
[57:09] you can go all the way back. HABACH IS A
[57:12] RESULT KIND OF GOING BACK IF WE I WOULD
[57:14] SAY MAYBE start back at Daniel and and
[57:17] from Daniel on he begins to tell about
[57:19] the end of the world. I'm not saying
[57:21] there's not other places messianic
[57:23] scriptures and millennial scriptures.
[57:24] I'm not saying that. But but PROPHECY
[57:26] CONCERNING THE WORLD, HEY, JUDGMENT'S
[57:28] coming
[57:30] &gt;&gt; and IT'S NOT NO, I'M NOT GOING TO CHANGE
[57:32] MY MIND. IT'S COMING AND AND I'M giving
[57:35] you a fair warning. And and Daniel, you
[57:38] know, he was he wanted to know when will
[57:39] these he saw the end of the world. And
[57:41] that's why the book of REVELATION IS
[57:42] PROBABLY 75 TO 80% almost verbatim out
[57:46] of the book of Daniel. So John as a
[57:48] second witness is seeing it. And then
[57:50] and and probably the only remaining 25
[57:53] 20 to 25% is is catching those
[57:57] prophecies up and making them relative
[57:59] to the Christian church. See, SO SO SO
[58:02] THEN YOU CAN'T BACK UP AND SAY, "OH, THE
[58:04] OLD TESTAMENT, YOU KNOW, MALACHI 4 WAS
[58:07] TO ISRAEL."
[58:10] You think?
[58:11] &gt;&gt; No kidding. THE WHOLE ENTIRE OLD
[58:13] TESTAMENT WAS TO ISRAEL. OH, I mean it
[58:16] wasn't written to the Philistines
[58:19] &gt;&gt; or the Egyptians.
[58:22] &gt;&gt; You're the WHOLE THE OLD TESTAMENT WAS
[58:24] FOR THE JEWS. YEAH. BUT I MEAN, I STILL
[58:27] GET TO OBSERVE BY HIS STRIPES I'M
[58:29] HEALED.
[58:30] &gt;&gt; I still get TO UNDERSTAND THAT MY
[58:33] INIQUITY WAS PUT UPON HIM. THE
[58:35] CHASTISEMENT OF MY PEACE WAS UPON HIM. I
[58:37] STILL GET TO HAVE ABRAHAM'S FAITH.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; AMEN. I STILL GET THE SIGN OF THE SON OF
[58:42] MAN.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; OH, YOU KNOW WHAT? A SILLY ARGUMENT THAT
[58:46] people make to try to resist the truth.
[58:49] And so, uh, so, so from Daniel on then
[58:53] you're going TO START GETTING THAT'S why
[58:54] you get all those that host of minor
[58:57] prophets, you know, those little two and
[59:00] three chapter ones that Naam and Habach
[59:02] hard to find and you got to hunt for
[59:04] them and kind of know where they are
[59:05] generally at least. And and so they're
[59:08] THEY'RE THEY'RE AUGMENTING EVERYTHING
[59:09] THAT DANIEL'S SAYING. THAT'S WHAT'S
[59:10] HAPPENING HERE. AND IT RUNS ALL THE WAY
[59:12] THROUGH MALACHI, YOU KNOW, BEFORE THE
[59:14] COMING of the great and dreadful day of
[59:16] the Lord that Daniel HAD SAW. MY LORD,
[59:17] WHEN SHALL THESE THINGS BE? NO, NO, NO,
[59:20] DANIEL, go your way. You'll sleep with
[59:21] your father's not coming in your
[59:23] lifetime. It's sealed up for the end
[59:25] time. So, we see here that Habachok is
[59:29] just carrying on that same prophecy.
[59:32] Now, a a point to be made is that in
[59:35] verse three, let's have that back again,
[59:38] brother Josh. Habach chapter 2 uh verse
[59:42] three. There's some some notes here that
[59:44] JFP commentary point out that I wanted
[59:47] to bring forward. Uh Jameson Faucet
[59:49] Brown commentary, one of my very
[59:51] favorite ones for Old Testament
[59:52] commentary,
[59:54] Old Testament and New Testament. Uh
[59:56] [clears throat] and so verse three, for
[59:58] the vision is yet FOR AN APPOINTED TIME.
[1:00:01] SO now
[1:00:02] it's told that right there, BROTHER
[1:00:04] JOSH. SO, SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT all of
[1:00:07] these prophecies that are going to come
[1:00:09] to pass, and he's here to say that it
[1:00:13] shall BE FOR AN APPOINTED TIME, BUT at
[1:00:16] the end, it it it'll speak. See, and it
[1:00:20] WON'T IT WON'T LIE. SEE, it it IT'LL IT
[1:00:23] SHALL SPEAK AND NOT LIE. AND SO, SO ONE
[1:00:27] OF THE things that that JFB POINTS OUT
[1:00:30] QUOTING Mau is that that that THIS WORD
[1:00:34] IT SHALL NOT lie is in the Hebrew can be
[1:00:39] can be translated it shall not be
[1:00:42] silent.
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, IT'S NOT LIKE A PROPHECY
[1:00:46] THEN IT DOESN'T COME TO pass
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; cuz then you'd go, "Oh, it it lied."
[1:00:51] See, BUT THE BUT THE POINT IS IT MIGHT
[1:00:54] NOT HAPPEN LIKE YOU THOUGHT IT WOULD,
[1:00:57] but it won't be a lie. It won't BE
[1:00:59] SILENT. THERE'LL BE SOMETHING HAPPENING.
[1:01:02] YOU MIGHT NOT NOTICE IT.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; THE WORLD MAY GO RIGHT ON AND NEVER SEE
[1:01:06] IT. BUT MY BUT THE AT THE END TIME THE
[1:01:09] PEOPLE WHO WHO KNOW THEIR GOD. SEE IT'S
[1:01:13] THE PEOPLE WHO KNOW THEIR GOD IN A real
[1:01:16] and meaningful way with sincerity AND
[1:01:20] DEDICATION. THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO
[1:01:23] WILL KNOW THEIR GOD at the end time.
[1:01:25] See? SO HE'S SO THEY'RE SO THEY'RE GOING
[1:01:28] ON TO SAY then that it's the same. AND
[1:01:31] HERE'S A POINT THAT JFB POINTED TO. This
[1:01:34] is why that in the Hebrew language, this
[1:01:39] word is translated for us in Proverbs
[1:01:41] 12:17. Now, you don't have to turn
[1:01:43] there, Josh. Just hold right there at
[1:01:45] Habach. But in Proverbs 12:17,
[1:01:49] it says, "He that speaketh truth showeth
[1:01:53] forth righteousness."
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO THIS SHOWETH FOR HE SPEAKS
[1:01:59] TRUTH BUT IT'S NOT JUST UH IT'S NOT JUST
[1:02:04] WORDS. IT'S NOT LIP service that it
[1:02:07] actually MEANS HE WILL BREATHE OUT WORDS
[1:02:10] or he will break forth as A BLAST AND
[1:02:15] IT'LL BE IN THE FORM OF A DEMONSTRATION
[1:02:19] THAT IT THAT IT WON'T JUST BE SOMEONE
[1:02:21] PREACHING THAT IT'LL BE THE VOICE OF A
[1:02:24] LIVED EXPRESSION. SEE, so he that he
[1:02:29] that speaks with a living voice, HE THAT
[1:02:34] SPEAKETH TRUTH SHOWETH FORTH
[1:02:37] RIGHTEOUSNESS.
[1:02:39] IT'S INCREDIBLE HOW MANY
[1:02:43] VOICES
[1:02:44] AND BIBLE EXPOSITORS and teachers AND
[1:02:49] APOLOGISTS FILL THE airwaves
[1:02:53] speaking
[1:02:55] speaking a TRUTH
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; BUT NOT SHOWING RIGHTEOUSNESS. AMEN.
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; That's a problem
[1:03:03] BECAUSE THIS IS ALL ABOUT THE END TIME
[1:03:06] AND IT'S SHOWING THAT AT THE END TIME
[1:03:09] THIS IS GOING TO BE A MAJOR ISSUE THAT
[1:03:12] EVERYBODY WILL BE WITH WITH their lips
[1:03:16] they do worship and honor me as we read
[1:03:19] in Isaiah but their heart is far from
[1:03:22] me.
[1:03:25] SO, SO WHAT YOU'RE SEEING TODAY IS NOT
[1:03:29] an accident. IT GOD FORETOLD IT
[1:03:32] CENTURIES, MILLENNIA before here we are
[1:03:36] today, you're living IN IT. AND IN FACT
[1:03:38] is it it COULD HAVE BEEN SAID ALL ALONG
[1:03:42] DOWN THROUGH THE AGES that at the end
[1:03:44] time it'll get worse and worse AND WORSE
[1:03:48] AND FINALLY IT WOULD TAKE A PROPHET TO
[1:03:50] COME TO THE END TIME AND SAY NOW I WILL
[1:03:53] TELL YOU SOMETHING IN THE NAME OF THE
[1:03:54] LORD IT WILL GET WORSE AND WORSE AND
[1:03:56] WORSE TILL THE WORLD GOES COMPLETELY
[1:03:58] INSANE. THERE WILL BE NO PEACE UNTIL
[1:04:02] JESUS COMES. AMEN.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; HE WOULD SAY THINGS LIKE, "THE CHURCH
[1:04:07] CANNOT GO IN A RAPTURE in its condition
[1:04:10] AND IT CAN'T GET ANY BETTER." WHY?
[1:04:13] BECAUSE THEY PUT CHRIST OUT. THE ONLY
[1:04:16] WAY YOU can be improved from your sin
[1:04:19] birth condition is to hear, recognize,
[1:04:22] AND ACT UPON EVERY WORD OF GOD. AND THAT
[1:04:25] ENTITLES YOU TO THE TOKEN.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; And that's the new birth. See, THEN THE
[1:04:32] BLOOD OF JESUS Christ is speaking for
[1:04:35] you and not until then. You have to walk
[1:04:38] in the light as he is in the light. See,
[1:04:42] SO THAT THAT'S NOT A NEW CONCEPT at the
[1:04:45] end time. THAT'S ALWAYS IT'S ALWAYS been
[1:04:49] shown that at the last day the that the
[1:04:52] righteous will be revealed because of
[1:04:55] the voice of their lived life. It is
[1:04:58] that that's the voice of the
[1:05:00] resurrection speaking through you THAT
[1:05:03] BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID WHEN THAT
[1:05:05] HEADSTONE COMES DOWN AND REST UPON THAT
[1:05:07] BODY AND YOU SAY OH IT'S A PYRAMID THE
[1:05:10] HEADSTONE ITSELF IS A PYRAMID COMING
[1:05:12] DOWN UPON IT COMPLETING THE GREAT
[1:05:14] PYRAMID SEE AND SO THIS IS WHY YOU HAVE
[1:05:17] THAT WHEN BROTHER BRANDHAM DREW IT HE'S
[1:05:19] GOT THAT IN HE'S GOT THAT THAT BLANK
[1:05:21] AREA IN BETWEEN THE TOP OF THE PYRAMID
[1:05:24] AND THE AND THE CAPSTONE AND HE'S
[1:05:26] WRITTEN IN THERE HOLY HOLY GHOST AND
[1:05:28] THERE'S NO IT'S ALL EMPTY AND IT'S JUST
[1:05:30] HOLY GHOST BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE AN
[1:05:32] INVISIBLE UNION IS TAKING PLACE. THE
[1:05:34] WORLD DOESN'T SEE IT. THEY CAN SEE THEY
[1:05:36] CAN TRACK IT THROUGH FAITH, TEMPERANCE,
[1:05:38] PATIENCE, ALL THESE. THEY CAN TRACK IT
[1:05:40] THROUGH PAUL AND ARMENIUS AND ALL THIS.
[1:05:41] THEY CAN AGREE WITH ALL THAT. BUT THEY
[1:05:42] COME TO THE END TIME AND LET ME TELL YOU
[1:05:44] SOMETHING. THERE'S NO GUARANTEE YOU'LL
[1:05:46] SEE IT JUST BECAUSE YOU SIT IN A MESSAGE
[1:05:47] CHURCH. YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE A REVELATION
[1:05:49] OF THAT THIS HEADSTONE AND YOU'VE GOT TO
[1:05:52] HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH THIS HEADSTONE.
[1:05:54] AND THAT'S WHERE THE INVISIBLE UNION IS
[1:05:57] TAKING PLACE. AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS, HE
[1:05:59] SAID THE POWER THAT WE'VE HAD WILL COME
[1:06:01] INTO ITS FULLNESS TO THE DEGREE THAT THE
[1:06:04] DEAD FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS WILL COME OUT
[1:06:06] OF THE GRAVE.
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; GOD,
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; SO IT'S ALWAYS BEEN A LIVED LIFE. IT'S
[1:06:13] NEVER NOT BEEN THAT.
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; SEE,
[1:06:18] THOUGH IT TAR, WAIT FOR it because it
[1:06:21] will surely come. It will not tarry.
[1:06:25] Now, I WANT TO CIRCLE BACK TO A FULL
[1:06:27] READING OF OUR of our scripture in
[1:06:29] Isaiah. So, let's go back there, brother
[1:06:31] Joshua. Isaiah 29,
[1:06:34] [clears throat]
[1:06:36] verse 9. STAY YOURSELVES IN WONDER. CRY
[1:06:39] YE ALOUD, and cry they that are drunken,
[1:06:42] but not with wine. They stagger, but not
[1:06:44] with strong drink.
[1:06:46] For the Lord hath poured out upon you
[1:06:49] the spirit of deep sleep, and hath
[1:06:51] closed your eyes, and prophets, the
[1:06:54] prophets, and your rulers, the seers
[1:06:56] hath he covered.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; And the vision of all is become unto you
[1:07:01] as the words of a book that is sealed,
[1:07:04] which men deliver to one that is
[1:07:05] learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee,
[1:07:08] and he saith, I cannot, for it is
[1:07:10] sealed. Verse 12. And the book IS
[1:07:12] DELIVERED TO HIM THAT IS NOT LEARNED,
[1:07:14] SAYING, READ THIS, I PRAY THEE, and he
[1:07:16] saith, I am not learned. Wherefore the
[1:07:19] Lord said, for as much as this people,
[1:07:21] now we're coming down to our text, drawn
[1:07:24] near me with their mouth and with their
[1:07:26] lips do honor me, but have removed their
[1:07:30] heart far from me, and their fear toward
[1:07:33] me is taught by the PRECEPT OF MEN.
[1:07:35] THEREFORE, BECAUSE OF THAT, SINCE ALL OF
[1:07:38] THAT'S TRUE, BEHOLD, I will proceed to
[1:07:41] do a marvelous work among this people,
[1:07:44] even a marvelous work and a wonder. For
[1:07:47] the wisdom, HERE'S THE MARVELOUS WORK,
[1:07:50] the wisdom OF THEIR WISE MEN SHALL
[1:07:52] PERISH, and the understanding of their
[1:07:55] prudent men shall be hid.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:59] See, SO NOW THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT JESUS
[1:08:02] SAID WOULD be the situation when that no
[1:08:06] one COULD APPROACH GOD WITHOUT COMING
[1:08:09] THROUGH THE SON.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; OKAY, I I got a workar around for that.
[1:08:15] Well, but wait, THERE'S MORE. AND NO ONE
[1:08:19] CAN KNOW THE SON UNLESS THE FATHER
[1:08:20] REVEALS HIM. AMEN.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; SO THERE YOU'RE EFFECTIVELY LOCKED OUT.
[1:08:24] WHETHER YOU COME FROM THE EAST, WEST,
[1:08:26] NORTH, OR SOUTH,
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; from the heights, dropping in from the
[1:08:29] depths, RISING UP, YOU CAN'T get in.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; Christ has to Christ is the door. Christ
[1:08:36] is the word AND THE HOLY SPIRIT HAS TO
[1:08:39] OPEN THE EYES OF YOUR UNDERSTANDING.
[1:08:42] YES.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; SEE,
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; SO JEHOVAH SPEAKING THROUGH Isaiah
[1:08:49] was cons he he IN THIS TIME THAT ISAIAH
[1:08:51] IS WRITING, HE'S CONFRONTING a great
[1:08:53] deal
[1:08:55] of blindness and hypocrisy in Israel.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; Now, we know that the Lord is very
[1:09:02] gracious and merciful. He says that of
[1:09:04] himself.
[1:09:06] uh and and and HE WILL CONSISTENTLY
[1:09:10] seek to open the eyes of the blind,
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; BUT HE HAS EXTRAORDINARILY LITTLE TO say
[1:09:17] to the hypocrite or the self-righteous
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; other than to speak to them of their
[1:09:24] certain doom. THE THE THE THE BOTTOM
[1:09:27] LINE IS FRIENDS is that you cannot
[1:09:30] replace genuine spirituality with
[1:09:35] ritual.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; That's a non-starter
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; for God.
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says in the message the
[1:09:45] communion
[1:09:48] um April the 18th, 1957. Now listen
[1:09:51] closely. Sometimes I put them up on the
[1:09:54] screen, sometimes I don't because I I
[1:09:57] sometimes I find it more effective just
[1:09:58] for you just to sit and listen. Now
[1:10:01] don't don't let your mind wander. Listen
[1:10:04] close.
[1:10:06] Brother Brandham says this is easy to
[1:10:09] follow. Now there is many that take the
[1:10:12] communion is not saved. Many eat the
[1:10:16] pascal lamb and perished in the
[1:10:18] wilderness. So he's talking about
[1:10:19] rituals and and orders and things that
[1:10:22] we have in the church. Many ate the
[1:10:24] pascal lamb and perished in the
[1:10:25] wilderness and many take the communion
[1:10:27] today that will never see God.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; But you cannot be a partaker of his
[1:10:34] salvation and not see him because
[1:10:38] salvation IS A GIFT OF God and communion
[1:10:41] is commemoration of the great
[1:10:43] allsufficient sacrifice that was made
[1:10:46] for that salvation. It's to let people
[1:10:49] see that we believe in the death. WHY DO
[1:10:53] WE HAVE THE the the ritual ceremony of
[1:10:56] of the Lord's supper? Why do we wash
[1:10:58] feet? Why do we why do we assemble in
[1:11:01] churches? Why do we baptize? All of
[1:11:03] these things. See, SO SO HE HE COMES
[1:11:06] BACK HERE. HE says um it's to let people
[1:11:10] see that we believe in the death,
[1:11:13] burial, and resurrection of the Lord
[1:11:15] Jesus Christ. It represents our ritual,
[1:11:18] a finished work.
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; See, salvation was once not completed in
[1:11:25] the offering of the goat, the sheep, the
[1:11:27] hepher in the Old Testament because the
[1:11:29] Old Testament blood could not atone for
[1:11:31] sin. It could only COVER SIN. IT WAS A
[1:11:34] POINTING TO A time when
[1:11:39] it would be completed. So he says, "BUT
[1:11:42] WHEN JESUS came and his blood was shed
[1:11:46] at Calvary, it was a complete divorcing
[1:11:50] of sin. IT TAKEN SIN AWAY. IT'S THE only
[1:11:55] means of salvation. There is no church
[1:11:58] joining, no letters OF FELLOWSHIP. THERE
[1:12:02] IS NO RITUAL BAPTISM. THERE IS NO
[1:12:05] COMMUNION OR NOTHING in the ritual or
[1:12:08] any article THAT'S BEEN LEFT OF GOD AS
[1:12:11] ARTICLES PERTAINING TO SALVATION. It's
[1:12:14] all in commemoration of a finished work.
[1:12:18] Water baptism does not save you as much
[1:12:21] as people sometimes think it does. Water
[1:12:24] baptism is a commemoration of the death,
[1:12:26] burial, and resurrection of the Lord. It
[1:12:28] does not save you. Communion is the
[1:12:31] commemoration of his great agony and his
[1:12:34] going OUT AND HIS BROKEN body and his
[1:12:37] blood THAT WAS SHED. IT'S NOT THE
[1:12:39] LITERAL BLOOD. It's not the LITERAL
[1:12:41] BODY, BUT IT'S IN COMMEMORATION of his
[1:12:43] literal body and of his precious blood.
[1:12:46] And we take this as an order and Jesus
[1:12:49] commanded us to do it. As long as he
[1:12:51] stays away, we're to take it. We have
[1:12:53] that coming up on our on our last day of
[1:12:56] the of the year. We always do that on
[1:12:58] New Year's Eve. Have the Lord's supper.
[1:13:01] So, so now, so I wanted to read all of
[1:13:05] that to you so that YOU SO THAT WHAT I'M
[1:13:08] SAYING HAS PROPHETIC UTTERANCE BEHIND
[1:13:10] IT. Real spirituality
[1:13:14] is authentic and it's born of effort.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; IT DOESN'T FALL OUT OF A TREE AND CON
[1:13:22] YOU ON THE HEAD.
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; REAL SPIRITUALITY. HOW MANY WANT THAT
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; REAL SPIRITUALITY
[1:13:31] IS A BYPRODUCT OF A disciplined mind,
[1:13:36] body and soul.
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; IT IS IN FACT IN SOME REGARD PROBABLY IN
[1:13:41] EVERY REGARD really in especially in the
[1:13:44] context OF MY SERMON TODAY it's a
[1:13:46] personal journey.
[1:13:48] IT'S IT RUNS DEEP AND IT'S IT'S GIVEN A
[1:13:51] PLACE OF IMPORTANCE IN THE individual
[1:13:55] who is seeking to serve God.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; WHAT WHAT WHAT IS WHAT IS GIVEN
[1:13:59] IMPORTANCE? SPIRITUALITY.
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; I WANT TO BE REALLY SPIRITUAL.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; I DON'T WANT TO JUST BE RITUALISTICALLY
[1:14:07] OBSERVANT.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; SEE,
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; IT RUNS SO DEEP THAT IT THAT IT
[1:14:13] TRANSFORMS THE worshipper from within.
[1:14:16] It's very real. See, THIS IS WHY BROTHER
[1:14:19] BRANDON WOULD WORD IT THE WAY THAT HE
[1:14:21] DID. UH IT'S A VERY REAL THING. AND AND
[1:14:24] IT IT LITERALLY TRANSFORMS US from
[1:14:27] within. Ritualistic
[1:14:30] spirituality
[1:14:32] is mere surface performance.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; And the earth today is filled with it
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; of Christian ritualism.
[1:14:41] JUST IT'S JUST A SURFACE performance
[1:14:44] without the true substance or much
[1:14:47] interchange if
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; if any at all.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; Certain religious rituals have their
[1:14:56] place and we actually do have certain
[1:14:59] rituals and certain orders left to us.
[1:15:03] But without GENUINE INTENT AND PERSONAL
[1:15:07] DISCIPLINE, they will, I promise you,
[1:15:10] THEY WILL LACK THE transforming power
[1:15:14] THAT PRODUCES AUTHENTIC SPIRITUALITY.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; IF YOU'RE JUST COMING TO CHURCH CUZ IT'S
[1:15:20] JUST WHAT YOU DO. YOU'VE BEEN TAUGHT AND
[1:15:23] RAISED AND YOU WANT TO SEE THE PEOPLE
[1:15:24] AND YOU HANG OUT. IF YOU COME TO THE
[1:15:26] LORD'S SUPPER, BECAUSE IT'S JUST A
[1:15:27] RITUAL, IF YOU GO TO THE WATER AND GO
[1:15:29] DOWN A A DRY SINNER, YOU'LL COME UP A
[1:15:31] WET SINNER.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; SEE, THERE'S GOT TO BE AN EFFECTIVE
[1:15:35] CHANGE. AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU
[1:15:36] SOMETHING. YOU YOU CAN'T GET IT
[1:15:38] YOURSELF, BUT I CAN GIVE YOU GOOD NEWS.
[1:15:40] IT IS IN HERE.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; And if you'll receive IT, IT WILL COME.
[1:15:44] AND THERE IS A SUPERNATURAL POWER THAT
[1:15:46] WILL CHANGE YOUR COMPLETE LIFE, MIND,
[1:15:49] BODY, AND SOUL.
[1:15:53] IRONICALLY,
[1:15:56] correct ritual performance
[1:16:00] is actually and and can be word-based,
[1:16:02] such as communion and footwashing, as
[1:16:04] I've said before, water baptism, the
[1:16:06] assembling at churches. Ironic because
[1:16:08] rituals generally um are considered WEAK
[1:16:11] AND INEFFECTIVE. BUT WHEN THEY ARE
[1:16:13] OBSERVED AND THEY'RE IN CONCERT WITH
[1:16:16] DEDICATION and sincerity, the ritual
[1:16:20] ACTUALLY BECOMES THE COMPLETION OF A
[1:16:22] duty before the Lord and is ACCEPTABLE
[1:16:26] IN HIS SIGHT A AS A SIGN OF YOUR
[1:16:29] SINCERITY.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; THIS IS WHAT THEY RAN INTO IN MATTHEW
[1:16:34] 25. THEY PRESENTED SACRIFICES AND
[1:16:36] OFFERINGS, BUT IT WAS NEVER WITH
[1:16:38] SINCERITY. AND IT'S DISALLOWED. SEE,
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; IT'S INTERESTING WHEN YOU LOOK AT THOSE
[1:16:43] GROUPS THERE before the judgment seat.
[1:16:45] You don't see the bride. She's seated on
[1:16:47] the throne. She at that time she's got a
[1:16:50] thousand years of of judgment experience
[1:16:52] under her belt and she's well able to
[1:16:54] judge even angels.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; AND SO, SO YOU FIND THAT THERE'S TWO
[1:16:59] GROUPS AND BOTH GROUPS ARE SURPRISED.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; ONE GROUP WHO THOUGHT THEY WOULD GET IN
[1:17:05] BECAUSE of their ritual
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; and got surprised that they're not
[1:17:08] getting in.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. and another group WHO WERE JUST
[1:17:11] SIMPLE PEOPLE WHO WHO LOVED GOD FOR
[1:17:14] REAL. THEY SERVED HIM FOR ALL THEY KNEW.
[1:17:17] They did THE BEST THEY COULD AND they
[1:17:19] were sincere in that AND EXPECTING
[1:17:22] REALLY NOTHING UH MORE THAN THE BLESSING
[1:17:24] THEY HAD ALREADY ENJOYED BY LIVING THAT
[1:17:27] KIND OF LIFE CUZ JUST LIVING THAT KIND
[1:17:28] OF LIFE IS A blessing on you.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; AND LO AND BEHOLD, THEY GET TO FIND OUT
[1:17:32] THAT THEY WERE GETTING CREDIT FOR THINGS
[1:17:34] THEY DIDN'T EVEN REMEMBER DOING. AND
[1:17:36] PROBABLY THERE'S NO RECORD THAT THEY
[1:17:38] EVER DID IT. HALLELUJAH. BUT THEY
[1:17:40] INHERIT BUT THEY BUT BUT THEIR FAITH WAS
[1:17:43] TOWARD CHRIST FOR ALL THEY KNEW. AND
[1:17:46] JUST LIKE ABRAHAM, THOSE DEEDS WERE
[1:17:48] RECKONED UNTO THEM.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; LORD, we don't really remember
[1:17:53] visiting. I mean, I'm glad I did, BUT I
[1:17:56] REALLY DON'T REMEMBER DOING IT.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; BRINGING YOU A DRINK OF COLA. YEAH. I I
[1:18:00] DON'T REALLY I MEAN, I'M GLAD I DID IT,
[1:18:01] BUT I REALLY I'M HONEST. SEE, THEY HAD
[1:18:03] ALWAYS BEEN HONEST. I I DON'T REALLY
[1:18:05] REMEMBER DOING THAT. AND THE KING JUST
[1:18:07] SAYS, "YEAH, IT'S MORE THE SAME. I WAS
[1:18:09] WATCHING YOU IN EARTH. DON'T WORRY.
[1:18:10] ENTER INTO THE JOYS OF THE LORD. I'M
[1:18:13] GOING TO GRANT YOU ETERNAL LIFE." I'M
[1:18:15] HERE TO TELL YOU SOMETHING, FRIENDS.
[1:18:16] THERE'S VALUE IN BEING JUST SINCERE
[1:18:18] BEFORE GOD AND JUST BEING REAL AND LET
[1:18:21] GOD WORK IN YOUR LIFE. OH, HALLELUJAH.
[1:18:24] WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T LIVE A LIFE OF
[1:18:26] SURFACE RITUALISM.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; I DON'T CARE WHAT DOCTRINE YOU'RE
[1:18:31] BELIEVING.
[1:18:33] SATAN DOESN'T CARE HOW RIGHT YOU ARE IN
[1:18:35] YOUR DOCTRINE.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; HE KNOWS IF YOU MISS THAT LIFE, YOU
[1:18:39] WON'T COME UP ANYWAY. He'll win in the
[1:18:41] end anyhow. He wins by default because
[1:18:43] you were born in sin.
[1:18:46] See? So,
[1:18:49] so there's blindness
[1:18:52] and [snorts] then there's self blindness
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; UPON WHICH GOD PRETTY MUCH pronounces no
[1:18:58] hope at all. But for those who want to
[1:19:04] be right,
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; I am one of those today. I want to be
[1:19:09] right.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; I don't care what it costs me. I want to
[1:19:13] be right.
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; And it's upon those that he makes a way
[1:19:18] of mercy even when they stumble.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; I'm going to have you turn uh well,
[1:19:25] let's just go on the screen because it's
[1:19:27] uh I don't want to slow you down.
[1:19:28] Nehemiah chapter 9, brother Josh, and
[1:19:31] just let's read along together. Uh, you
[1:19:35] know, when you read this, you're going
[1:19:36] to see that how God actually handled the
[1:19:40] the failures and constant failures and
[1:19:44] repeated failures of his family who
[1:19:46] loved him but failed.
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; And you're going to see a heavenly
[1:19:51] father handle that with discipline and
[1:19:54] then forgiveness and restoration. And
[1:19:56] then they'll do it again. And he'll
[1:19:58] handle it like a loving father who loves
[1:20:00] his children. He'll discipline them.
[1:20:02] He'll set the order back in. And he'll
[1:20:03] give them another chance. Watch. Now, if
[1:20:06] he was this way under the blood of bulls
[1:20:08] and goats, friends, what must he be
[1:20:10] under the blood of Christ? Nehemiah
[1:20:13] 9:24. So the children went in
[1:20:17] and possessed the land,
[1:20:20] and thou subduest before them the
[1:20:24] inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites,
[1:20:27] and gavest them into their hands with
[1:20:29] their kings, and the people of the land,
[1:20:32] that they might do with them as they
[1:20:33] would. Verse 25.
[1:20:36] And they took strong cities and fat land
[1:20:39] and possessed houses full of goods,
[1:20:41] wells, digged vineyards and olive yards
[1:20:44] and fruit trees in abundance. So they
[1:20:47] did eat and were filled and became fat
[1:20:51] and delighted themselves in thy great
[1:20:53] goodness. Nevertheless, they were
[1:20:56] disobedient and rebelled against thee
[1:20:59] and cast thy law behind their backs and
[1:21:01] slew thy prophets which testified
[1:21:03] against them to turn them to thee. and
[1:21:06] they wrought great provocations.
[1:21:08] Therefore thou deliverest them into the
[1:21:12] hand of their enemies who vex them. And
[1:21:15] in the time of their trouble when they
[1:21:17] cried unto thee, thou heardest them from
[1:21:19] heaven. And according to thy manifold
[1:21:21] mercies, thou gavest them saviors who
[1:21:25] saved them out of the hand of their
[1:21:26] enemies. These were the judges and the
[1:21:28] prophets and the priests and mighty
[1:21:31] righteous kings who were saviors. Do you
[1:21:33] realize, friends, you're sent into the
[1:21:35] world as saviors?
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah. You know, you and and because
[1:21:41] Israel, this is a this is a the good,
[1:21:44] the bad, the ugly. This is the the
[1:21:46] believer, the makebeliever, and the
[1:21:47] unbeliever all mingled in together. But
[1:21:50] God preserved them. I mean, if you doubt
[1:21:52] that, then how did they get restored in
[1:21:54] 1948 with a six-point star of David?
[1:21:56] BECAUSE GOD HAS THEM INSCRIBED in the
[1:21:59] palms of his hands. I know he's not. He
[1:22:01] he he offered salvation to Pharisees,
[1:22:04] they're never going to take it. They're
[1:22:05] never going to be saved. Th those
[1:22:07] lawyers who stand at the door of
[1:22:09] knowledge and don't go in and and
[1:22:12] themselves and refuse entry to those who
[1:22:14] would go in. Those preachers who tell
[1:22:17] women it's okay. AND BROTHER BRANDHAM
[1:22:19] SAID, YOU KNOW, THE BIBLE SAYS YOU
[1:22:20] SHOULDN'T CUT YOUR HAIR AND THE WOMAN
[1:22:21] SAYS, BUT BROTHER BRANDHAM, MY PREACHER
[1:22:23] says it's okay. And he said he'll suffer
[1:22:25] for that in the regions beyond. Amen.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; I get why they want to imagine William
[1:22:30] Brandham as a false prophet, they need
[1:22:31] to believe that. They better hope that's
[1:22:33] true because if if it's if it's not and
[1:22:35] he was true, they're finished
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; because he's already pronounced they'll
[1:22:39] suffer for that in the regions beyond.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; See, so so according to thy manifold
[1:22:47] mercies, thou gavest them saviors who
[1:22:49] saved them out of the hands of their
[1:22:50] enemies. Verse 28, but after they had
[1:22:53] rest, they did evil again before thee.
[1:22:55] Therefore le leftest thou them in the
[1:22:58] hand of their enemies, so that they had
[1:23:00] the dominion over them. Yet when they
[1:23:02] returned, and cried unto thee, thou
[1:23:05] heardest them from heaven. AND MANY
[1:23:07] TIMES DID THOU DELIVER THEM ACCORDING TO
[1:23:10] THY MERCIES, AND TESTIFIED AGAINST THEM,
[1:23:13] THAT THOU MIGHTEST BRING THEM AGAIN UNTO
[1:23:16] thy law. Yet they doubt proudly, and
[1:23:18] hearken not under thy commands, but
[1:23:20] sinned against thy judgments, which if a
[1:23:22] man do, he shall live in them. and
[1:23:25] withdrew THE SHOULDER AND HARDENED THEIR
[1:23:27] neck and would not hear. YET YET MANY
[1:23:30] YEARS DID THOU FORBEAR THEM AND
[1:23:32] TESTIFIED AGAINST THEM BY THE SPIRIT IN
[1:23:34] THY PROPHETS. Yet they would not give an
[1:23:37] ear. THEREFORE GAVEST THOU THEM INTO THE
[1:23:39] HAND OF THE PEOPLE OF THE LANDS.
[1:23:40] NEVERTHELESS, FOR THY GREAT MERCY'S
[1:23:43] SAKE, THOU DID not utterly consume them,
[1:23:46] nor forsake them, for thou art a
[1:23:49] gracious and merciful God.
[1:23:53] TAKE THAT ALONE HOME WITH YOU TODAY. He
[1:23:55] is a gracious and merciful God. HE MAY
[1:24:00] CHASTISE YOU IF YOU'RE SONS AND
[1:24:02] DAUGHTERS OF GOD. HE WILL CHASTISE YOU
[1:24:05] PERHAPS WITH MANY STRIPES, BUT IT'S ALL
[1:24:08] IT'S THE TENDER HAND OF JEHOVAH. I DON'T
[1:24:10] KNOW WHAT IT MIGHT LOOK LIKE TO YOU, BUT
[1:24:12] I'M HERE TO TELL YOU HIS THRONE, AS
[1:24:14] WE'VE BEEN PREACHING, IS ESTABLISHED IN
[1:24:17] MERCY.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:24:21] SO, the superiority then
[1:24:24] of the new covenant. We're going to get
[1:24:26] ready to go to First Corinthians.
[1:24:27] Brother Josh, take that down and let's
[1:24:29] get me 1 Corinthians chapter 12. And
[1:24:32] I'll we'll give you the starting point
[1:24:34] in a moment. SO, THE SUPERIORITY OF THE
[1:24:37] NEW COVENANT
[1:24:39] WAS THAT THE FAMILY OF God are all
[1:24:46] from Genesis. Let me say IT LIKE THIS.
[1:24:48] FROM GENESIS ALL THE WAY GOD FILLING UP
[1:24:52] THE ROLE ALL THE WAY Old Testament
[1:24:54] bride, New Testament bride, all the way
[1:24:57] to the consummation of the ages. Here's
[1:25:00] a point to remember that I'm going to
[1:25:02] prove it by Paul's writing. SO THE
[1:25:05] FAMILY OF GOD are all all and always and
[1:25:10] in every case all the family of God are
[1:25:13] born TO BE SPIRITUAL people who operate
[1:25:18] kingdom powers.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; IN A FALLEN WORLD. YES.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; SEE,
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; and they DID THAT IN THE OLD TESTAMENT
[1:25:27] EVEN WITHOUT THE THE ADVANTAGE YOU HAVE
[1:25:30] of the baptism of the Holy Ghost giving
[1:25:32] them a new birth.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; See, SO PAUL SAID THIS IS WHY PAUL COMES
[1:25:37] TO 1 CORINTHIANS 12:7 TO 111. BUT THE
[1:25:41] MANIFESTATION OF THE spirit is given to
[1:25:45] every MAN TO PROFIT WITH ALL. FOR TO ONE
[1:25:48] IS GIVEN THE SPIRIT OF THE word of
[1:25:49] wisdom, to another the word of knowledge
[1:25:51] by the same Spirit, to another faith by
[1:25:54] the same Spirit, to another the gift OF
[1:25:57] HEALING BY THE SAME SPIRIT, to another
[1:25:59] the working of miracles, to another
[1:26:01] prophecy, to another discerning of
[1:26:02] spirits, to another diverse kinds of
[1:26:04] tongues, to another the interpretation
[1:26:06] OF TONGUES. BUT ALL THESE WORKKETH that
[1:26:09] one in the selfsame spirit, dividing to
[1:26:12] every man severally as he will. SO THEN
[1:26:16] WE FIND THAT IT becomes the design OF
[1:26:20] THE HOLY SPIRIT, THE HOLY GHOST BAPTISM.
[1:26:23] WHAT IS THE DESIGN? WHAT'S THE PURPOSE
[1:26:26] OF THE HOLY GHOST COMING? TO LEAD YOU
[1:26:29] AND GUIDE YOU TO ALL TRUTH, WHICH WHEN
[1:26:32] YOU HEAR, RECOGNIZE AND AND FOLLOW, THEN
[1:26:36] THEN YOU ARE BORN AGAIN OF THE SPIRIT OF
[1:26:38] GOD. IT. SO THE WHOLE DESIGN OF THE HOLY
[1:26:41] SPIRIT IS TO BRING THE ZOEY LIFE THAT IS
[1:26:46] ALREADY WITHIN you from BIRTH TO
[1:26:48] MANIFESTATION. THAT'S HIS PURPOSE.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; HE'S NOT THE HOLY GHOST ISN'T SANTA.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; He's not here to RECEIVE FROM YOU A WISH
[1:27:00] LIST.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND? AS I'VE SAID FOR
[1:27:04] DECADES, HE'S NOT A VENDING MACHINE.
[1:27:06] WHEN YOU GET IN TROUBLE AND YOU WALK UP
[1:27:08] WITH 75 CENTS AND I NEED I NEED SOME
[1:27:10] HELP WITH THIS TROUBLE AND YOU PUT IN
[1:27:11] THE MONEY AND PULL A LEVER AND YOU GET A
[1:27:12] RESCUE. THAT'S NOT WHAT HE IS. THAT'S
[1:27:15] NOT WHY HE CAME. HE CAME TO BRING
[1:27:17] BECAUSE YOU WERE BORN WITH A PART OF HIS
[1:27:20] LIFE. AND HE'S COMING IN THIS AGE UNDER
[1:27:22] THE HOLY GHOST TO BRING THAT PART TO
[1:27:24] LIFE TO ANNIHILATE THE OLD YOU AND MAKE
[1:27:27] YOU A BRAND NEW CREATION in Christ
[1:27:30] Jesus. SO THAT WHY? SO THAT HE CAN SAY
[1:27:33] NOW YOU'RE SAVED. SEE YOU IN THE
[1:27:34] RAPTURE. NO, IT'S SO THAT YOU CAN GO
[1:27:37] THROUGH THE LAND AND BE A SAVIOR
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; TO A DARK WORLD, TO YOUR FAMILY, TO
[1:27:42] OTHERS AROUND YOU. BUT YOU'LL NEVER BE
[1:27:44] THAT WITH COLD, FORMAL RITUALISM. YOU'VE
[1:27:46] GOT TO HAVE A DISCIPLINED MIND AND A
[1:27:49] BODY AND A SOUL THAT ADHERES TO THE WORD
[1:27:51] OF GOD AND SAYS, "LORD, BY WHATEVER
[1:27:53] MEANS YOU FIND NECESSARY, BRING ME TO
[1:27:55] THE IMAGE OF THIS WORD."
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:28:00] IT'S A PROCESS THAT WE CALL SCRIPTURALLY
[1:28:03] THE NEW birth or being born again. And
[1:28:06] from there then IT BECOMES THE DESIGN OF
[1:28:09] THE HOLY GHOST TO FLOW through the
[1:28:12] various gifts and callings that God
[1:28:15] installed in you and assigned to your
[1:28:19] life for his usage.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; I don't know how to explain the Holy
[1:28:24] Ghost clearer. Yeah.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; It is to transform you from the from the
[1:28:30] dark world you're born into into the
[1:28:32] glorious liberty OF THE SON OF GOD.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; IT IS TO BRING A SEED GENE OF GOD THAT
[1:28:37] WAS INSTALLED IN YOU FROM BIRTH. AND
[1:28:39] INSIDE OF THAT IS GIFTS THAT HE HAS
[1:28:41] SEVERALLY GIFTED YOU WITH. AND THE WHOLE
[1:28:43] PURPOSE IS TO BRING YOU TO LIFE AND THEN
[1:28:45] SET YOU IN ORDER SO THAT HE CAN LIVE
[1:28:48] THROUGH YOU. AMEN.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; SEE,
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; we come on THINGS IN THE BIBLE AND I
[1:29:01] want to turn a corner and run for the
[1:29:03] finish line now. You good?
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; Don't get nervous. I'm fitting to close.
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; Where's my amen sign? I don't have one.
[1:29:14] I need to make Diggs leave me that.
[1:29:17] No, but you're [snorts] pulling good
[1:29:18] enough already.
[1:29:23] And and and now here I suppose I could
[1:29:27] say might be a an equal burden to
[1:29:30] everything I've just said, an equal
[1:29:31] burden to my heart in this series of
[1:29:34] Lucifer's counter claim.
[1:29:39] You know,
[1:29:40] we left off with Joseph and
[1:29:44] there was there was things in Joseph's
[1:29:47] life
[1:29:49] and I hope this is okay cuz I'm I'm I'm
[1:29:52] from here. I'm not going to try to
[1:29:53] follow my notes line by line. I just
[1:29:55] want to talk to you from my heart. Is
[1:29:57] that okay?
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; You've agreed so nicely with everything
[1:30:00] we've shown you uh through our lesson.
[1:30:04] So now let me get down to where it's
[1:30:07] applying into our lives. And this is the
[1:30:09] real burden of my heart.
[1:30:12] And you know we we've talked about
[1:30:14] Satan's counter claim to God's claim
[1:30:16] that God's going to have a kingdom of
[1:30:18] saints and he's going to dwell among
[1:30:19] them. And Lucifer's over here counter
[1:30:22] claiming that. No, I'm going to ascend
[1:30:23] above the stars of God. I'm going to
[1:30:25] take your throne and I'm going to sit in
[1:30:26] the north and I'm going to be like the
[1:30:27] most high God.
[1:30:29] Now, if you if you look at the world
[1:30:33] today, it looks very much like Satan has
[1:30:36] pulled that off.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; He is the god of the age by popular
[1:30:41] demand.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; He has had 6,000 years and he has
[1:30:47] magnificently crafted his Eden just like
[1:30:50] he his his Eden is nearly equal in sin
[1:30:55] as God's was in beauty.
[1:30:58] Yeah,
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; it's unprecedented. It's gone to levels
[1:31:02] where there's no rational thought
[1:31:04] anymore. IT'S JUST DEBAUCHERY DEBAUCHERY
[1:31:07] and decadence to the levels inexplicable
[1:31:10] levels
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; on the common streets, laws and
[1:31:14] governments and courts and and I'm not
[1:31:16] here for a political soapbox, but I'm
[1:31:18] just here to tell you this is a sick,
[1:31:19] broken world we live in. Amen.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; But I'm glad to KNOW THAT GOD STILL HAS
[1:31:24] SAVIORS walking the streets
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; because what IS HE DOING? WHY ARE WE
[1:31:28] STILL HERE, BROTHER JASON? NEARLY SEVEN
[1:31:30] DECADES. NEARLY SEVEN DECADES AFTER THE
[1:31:33] OPENING OF THE SEALS, GOING ON TOWARDS
[1:31:35] seven decades now, as fast as we can go.
[1:31:39] And you know, AND AND WHY WHY WHY IS ALL
[1:31:41] THIS STILL HAPPENING? AND I CAN TELL YOU
[1:31:43] IT'S BECAUSE HE'S STILL FILLING UP THE
[1:31:45] ROLE.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; There's still names THAT HAVE TO BE
[1:31:48] FOUND AND BROUGHT IN. AND I JUST SAY,
[1:31:50] "Let's go find them."
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; See,
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; it's not a It's not a I I I don't need
[1:31:56] to I I mean, I IT'S NOT ABOUT ME
[1:31:59] DECIDING WE'RE GOING TO GO OUT HERE WITH
[1:32:01] on the streets with an evangelistic
[1:32:03] appeal that just brings in, you know,
[1:32:07] CASTING A BIG GOSPEL NET LIKE THEY DID
[1:32:09] BACK IN THE DAY WHEN THE when the ponds
[1:32:11] were filled with fish AND BUT BROTHER
[1:32:13] BRANDHAM SAID THE PONDS HAVE ALL BEEN
[1:32:15] SANE DRIED. NOW IT'S JUST ONE HERE AND
[1:32:17] ONE THERE and one here and one there.
[1:32:18] I'm not looking to to put I'M NOT
[1:32:21] LOOKING TO PUT HUMANS IN these in any of
[1:32:23] these EMPTY SEATS WHO DON'T WHO AREN'T
[1:32:25] LOVERS OF THE WORD.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; SEE, I BECAUSE I'M I'M AWARE WHY YOU
[1:32:30] SAY, "WELL, DON'T WE NEED TO AT LEAST
[1:32:31] TRY?" HERE'S WHAT I KNOW. THE BIBLE
[1:32:34] TAUGHT FROM THE EARLIEST CHURCH AGE,
[1:32:36] WHICH MEANS IT'S STILL THE ORDER FOR
[1:32:38] TODAY. IT'S THE STANDARD. IS THAT GOD
[1:32:41] ADDS SEVERALLY TO THE CHURCH SUCH AS he
[1:32:44] will. Yes.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; SEE,
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; SO WE GO OUT AND WE EVANGELIZE. WE GO
[1:32:49] OUT AND WE DO MISSIONARY WORK. We've
[1:32:51] done it. We still do it. We come up with
[1:32:53] inventive IDEAS OF HOW TO HOLD OUTREACH
[1:32:55] HERE AND OUTREACH THERE. WE'VE DONE IT.
[1:32:57] BUT AT THE SAME TIME, I'M NOT GOING TO
[1:33:00] ABANDON THE PRIMARY FOCUS AND THE PRIME
[1:33:02] DIRECTIVE of me as A MESSAGE PASTOR TO
[1:33:05] INSTILL IN YOU THE WORD OF GOD TO BRING
[1:33:07] YOU TO RAPTURING FAITH.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; TO BRING THE SLEEPING SAINTS OUT OF THE
[1:33:11] GROUND. THAT'S MY PRIMARY FOCUS.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:33:15] SEE, so we CAN'T GET THAT OUT OF
[1:33:17] BALANCE,
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; SO, SO WE DO APPEAL TO ALL and we're
[1:33:22] we're on the internet and we do outdoor
[1:33:24] activities. WE'VE DONE THEM GALORE. BUT
[1:33:27] at the end of the day, WE HAVE PROVEN
[1:33:29] OVER OVER 30 YEARS, YOU KNOW, UM IN
[1:33:32] PASTORING FOR 30 YEARS THAT GOD ADDS TO
[1:33:34] THE CHURCH SEVERALLY AS HE WILL.
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; And he gifts severally as he will. And
[1:33:39] he uses those gifts severally as he
[1:33:41] will. BUT HIS EYES RUN TO AND FRO
[1:33:43] THROUGHOUT THE EARTH LOOKING FOR ANYONE
[1:33:45] WHO'LL BELIEVE HIS WORD.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; I'm a believer.
[1:33:52] So
[1:33:53] it's it becomes almost A SOMETIMES A
[1:33:57] QUESTION, YOU KNOW, HAS IT has it
[1:34:00] mattered? I mean, WE WE HAD A PROPHET
[1:34:03] HERE AND SUCH WONDERFUL MEETINGS and
[1:34:05] revival and went around the world and
[1:34:07] and SOMETIMES WE WANT TO LIVE IN YESTER
[1:34:10] YEAR AND SAY, "OH, IF WE COULD JUST HAVE
[1:34:11] THAT DISCERNMENT BACK, we could prove to
[1:34:13] the world and shut all their mouths." A
[1:34:15] PROPHET DID THAT AROUND THE WORLD SEVEN
[1:34:16] TIMES. And you can HEAR ON THE TAPE AND
[1:34:19] THEY WOULD REJOICE AND SCREAM HALLELUJAH
[1:34:21] AND PANDEMONIUM and would BREAK OUT IN
[1:34:23] DIVINE MIRACLES ON A ON A ON NEXT LEVEL
[1:34:26] scale
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; things that hadn't BEEN SEEN. AND
[1:34:29] BROTHER BRANDHAM COULD record in A
[1:34:32] SINGLE MEETING OVER 33 YEARS OF
[1:34:34] MINISTRY, SEVEN TIMES AROUND THE WORLD.
[1:34:37] And he often recorded in a single
[1:34:39] service MORE MIRACLES THAN ARE RECORDED
[1:34:41] IN THE ENTIRE BIBLE.
[1:34:43] AMEN.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; SEE, HE MY WIFE AND I, WE WERE JUST
[1:34:46] LISTENING YESTERDAY um to a sermon and
[1:34:49] and Brother Brandham comes to a PRAYER
[1:34:51] LINE AND HE STARTS TO TALK TO A WOMAN
[1:34:53] AND HE JUST ALMOST FREEZES and he goes,
[1:34:56] "Now, don't you do that." He said,
[1:34:59] "Don't you dare. You better not do that.
[1:35:01] That thing you're thinking about doing,
[1:35:03] don't you better not do that."
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; And that woman breaks down and starts
[1:35:07] weeping. AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU
[1:35:08] SOMETHING, FRIENDS. THIS WAS THIS WAS SO
[1:35:10] CONFIRMED. WE DON'T NEED TO ARGUE ABOUT
[1:35:13] IT. I DON'T NEED TO DEFEND IT. MY LIFE
[1:35:14] IS A DEFENSE of it.
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That it went around the
[1:35:18] world, that it OPERATED PERFECTLY. IT
[1:35:20] GOES WITH ALMOST THAT'S JUST A FOREGONE
[1:35:23] CONCLUSION. AND THE WORLD IS A
[1:35:24] UNDENIABLE WITNESS TO IT.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; TENS OF THOUSANDS WITNESS IT. I DON'T
[1:35:28] NEED TO ARGUE OR PROVE ANYTHING TO
[1:35:29] SOMEONE. I KNOW WHAT IT'S DONE IN MY
[1:35:31] LIFE. I SEE WHAT IT'S DOING IN YOUR
[1:35:33] LIFE.
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; BUT AT THE SAME TIME, THEN THAT PASSED
[1:35:38] AWAY. AND THEN, YOU KNOW, WE GO INTO THE
[1:35:40] 70S and and the the turmoil that the
[1:35:43] bride went through globally and it makes
[1:35:45] sense TO US NOW BECAUSE WE WERE JUST
[1:35:47] CHILDREN. SHE WAS AN INFANT BRIDE and
[1:35:50] when the seals are open and she grows
[1:35:51] through her adolescence and sometimes
[1:35:53] YOU KNOW TEENAGERS DON'T ALWAYS DO THE
[1:35:56] RIGHT THING. THEY DON'T THEY DON'T HAVE
[1:35:58] A LOT OF TIMES THEY ARE SMARTER THAN
[1:35:59] THEIR PARENTS but they don't have enough
[1:36:01] life experience to know how to operate.
[1:36:03] So teenagers, you need to listen to your
[1:36:06] parents because THEY YOU MIGHT BE
[1:36:08] ACTUALLY SMARTER. ALL THREE OF MY BOYS
[1:36:10] ARE PROBABLY SMARTER THAN ME, BUT I GOT
[1:36:12] MORE LIFE experience
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; to SAY, "SON, I TRIED THAT." I REMEMBER
[1:36:16] BROTHER EDDIE, I would I WAS ALWAYS THE
[1:36:18] KIND TO come in ON THE JOB AND GO, "DAD,
[1:36:19] WHY ARE WE DOING IT THIS WAY? WE SHOULD
[1:36:20] DO IT THIS WAY." AND bring this ladder
[1:36:22] over HERE AND SET THIS BUCKET. FINALLY,
[1:36:23] Brother Eddie just had enough of one day
[1:36:25] and he just he just did that wave of the
[1:36:27] hand that he always does. Son, anything
[1:36:29] you can think of, I've already tried.
[1:36:32] [laughter]
[1:36:36] I didn't even have a response. And I'm
[1:36:38] usually have a response. I didn't even
[1:36:39] know what to say. I just turned away and
[1:36:41] bowed my head and went to do what he
[1:36:43] told me. I never challenged him again.
[1:36:46] And I and I saw that I saw that as I
[1:36:49] began to gain painting experience that,
[1:36:51] you know, there there you don't always
[1:36:53] try to fix something that ain't broke.
[1:36:56] And so, SO WE FIND THAT, you know, and
[1:37:00] then and then in the 80S AND FINALLY
[1:37:02] JUST A JUST A LITTLE BIT OF historical
[1:37:03] perspective that I happen to have
[1:37:05] growing up raised up in it and growing
[1:37:07] up through it and tremendous wonderful
[1:37:10] deep revelations as the bride began to
[1:37:12] mature and and it wasn't happening in
[1:37:14] America. was happening abroad and
[1:37:16] overseas. And the bride was beginning to
[1:37:17] realize things like, "Wait a minute. The
[1:37:20] prophet said that the seventh angel is
[1:37:22] standing on the earth when the mighty
[1:37:24] one descends." And so, how is brother
[1:37:25] Brandham not here for the rapture? He
[1:37:27] must be going to come back and then the
[1:37:28] rapture. And we had all these ideas and
[1:37:30] it and and AS WE BEGIN TO COME INTO THE
[1:37:32] THROUGH THE LATE 70S, EARLY 80S, mid
[1:37:35] 80s, now men of God, great men OF GOD, I
[1:37:38] YOU KNOW, I REMEMBER MEN THAT I'VE BEEN
[1:37:40] ASSOCIATED with and some of our great
[1:37:42] warriors and generals who have already
[1:37:44] gone on uh to their reward and and I and
[1:37:47] I think of brother Bisl, I think of
[1:37:48] brother Howard Carroll, I think of of of
[1:37:51] brother Lonnie Jenkins and all these
[1:37:53] wonderful saints and pilgrims of the
[1:37:55] faith and brother Shrewsbury and
[1:37:57] different ones WHO HAD SUCH A LIVING
[1:37:59] testimony and and and you know we we we
[1:38:03] thought I remember I remember one time I
[1:38:05] was in a meeting in Colombia. Uh brother
[1:38:07] Hughes had put it on and he had rented a
[1:38:10] a large auditorium. This was way before
[1:38:12] the days of the internet, you know, when
[1:38:14] when everybody could just have their own
[1:38:16] private viewing of all the meetings
[1:38:17] around the world. And this is where you
[1:38:19] could it was no problem if you bring in
[1:38:21] the a minister and seat 12,000 12 I mean
[1:38:24] a,000 or,200 or 1500 people. THAT WASN'T
[1:38:26] UNCOMMON. STILL NOT UNCOMMON IN Africa
[1:38:29] and India and places like that. But
[1:38:31] America, we've just heard too much,
[1:38:33] brother Brandham said. SO A LOT OF TIMES
[1:38:35] YOU CAN'T EVEN GET PEOPLE TO COME
[1:38:36] REGULARLY TO CHURCH to say nothing of
[1:38:38] meetings. AND SO SO I REMEMBER IN A
[1:38:42] MEETING THERE IN,001,200
[1:38:43] PEOPLE AND brother Ed was preaching and
[1:38:46] and and he JUST HE JUST MADE A STATEMENT
[1:38:49] and he HE WAS TALKING ABOUT UH Joseph
[1:38:54] and and HIS GENTILE WIFE Azenath and how
[1:38:58] that that she had to be dismissed to THE
[1:39:03] PALACE WHILE HE MADE HIMSELF KNOWN TO
[1:39:06] his brethren,
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; WHICH WE KNOW IS THE GOSPEL GOING BACK
[1:39:10] TO THE JEWS. AND AT THIS TIME SO MANY
[1:39:13] THINGS WERE HAPPENING IN ISRAEL and the
[1:39:14] the the the you know the Berlin wall had
[1:39:17] had come HAD YOU KNOW WAS GETTING READY
[1:39:19] TO COLLAPSE AND COMMUNISM WAS GOING TO
[1:39:21] RETREAT AND the east WAS GOING TO JOIN
[1:39:22] BACK TO THE WEST AND THESE WERE THESE
[1:39:24] WERE CLIMACTIC EVENTS THAT WE WERE JUST
[1:39:26] LIKE WOW YOU KNOW AND AND AND I AND I
[1:39:29] REMEMBER BROTHER ED JUST REFERENCED THE
[1:39:31] THE THINGS THAT WE COULD SEE IN THE news
[1:39:34] and he just said he said HE SAID I CAN
[1:39:38] TELL YOU THAT IF THIS IS THAT THAT IT'S
[1:39:41] THE TIME FOR GOD TO MAKE HIMSELF KNOWN
[1:39:44] TO HIS BRETHREN. HE SAID, "THEN I CAN
[1:39:46] TELL YOU FOR SURE, WE ARE ON OUR WAY TO
[1:39:48] THE PALACE."
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; AND THAT just went
[1:39:54] OUT ACROSS THAT THING. I CAME TO MYSELF
[1:39:57] OUT IN THE AISLE STANDING UP SCREAMING
[1:39:59] AT THE TOP OF MY LUNGS. PANDEMONIUM
[1:40:01] BROKE OUT. PEOPLE WERE FALLING AND
[1:40:03] FAINTING AND SCREAMING. A CRESCENDO OF
[1:40:06] SHOUT BECAUSE THE BRIDE SUDDENLY IT WAS
[1:40:09] REAL. WE'RE REALLY GOING HOME.
[1:40:17] AND THEN I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT THE THE
[1:40:18] GREAT SERMONS THAT BEGAN TO COME FROM
[1:40:21] THOSE GREAT ministries and the 10 years
[1:40:23] that I was privileged to travel around
[1:40:25] the world with brother Lonnie and learn
[1:40:27] AT HIS FEET MANY things and sitting MANY
[1:40:30] TIMES ONE TWO IN THE MORNING at his feet
[1:40:32] and me and him talking WITH OUR BIBLES
[1:40:34] OPEN DISCUSSING THIS DISCUSSING THAT AND
[1:40:36] YOU KNOW ME HIM GIVING ME LOTS OF POINTS
[1:40:39] FOR ME TO THINK ABOUT IT ME GIVING HIM A
[1:40:40] FEW OF MY POINTS FOR HIM TO THINK ABOUT
[1:40:42] AND IT IT WAS SUCH A A WONDERFUL
[1:40:44] FRIENDSHIP THAT WE HAD. I LOOK FORWARD
[1:40:46] TO SEEING HIM AGAIN.
[1:40:49] BUT, you know, WE WE THOUGHT THAT THAT
[1:40:51] THAT THOSE THINGS YOU SAY, WELL, DID
[1:40:54] they did they even matter.
[1:40:58] I mean, we thought we were going and
[1:41:00] that was the late 80s. And then we
[1:41:03] thought for sure the early 90s and the
[1:41:05] Russians have retreated and the Berlin
[1:41:07] Wall has come down. We must be going
[1:41:08] home. And then then the mid 90s and then
[1:41:10] I came here to pastor and then the late
[1:41:12] 90s and and then we TURNED INTO AND NO
[1:41:15] WAY COULD we go into a new millennium
[1:41:16] until we did. No way we could hit a hit
[1:41:19] the 21ST CENTURY UNTIL WE ARE NOW 25
[1:41:21] YEARS DEEP INTO THAT.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; YOU SAY HAS IT MATTERED? I WANT TO TELL
[1:41:27] YOU SOMETHING. EVERYTHING THAT'S
[1:41:29] HAPPENED mattered
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; when Jesus told the disciples, "Go into
[1:41:36] Jerusalem and you're going to go down a
[1:41:38] certain street, turn this, go this way,
[1:41:39] and you're going to find a colt tied and
[1:41:42] untie loose him and bring him to me. AND
[1:41:43] IF ANYBODY ASKS you what what are you
[1:41:46] doing reloosing my cult, just say the
[1:41:47] master hath need of him and they'll give
[1:41:49] you leave." And the disciples, here they
[1:41:51] go. They don't even realize. They turned
[1:41:54] a corner and suddenly they just stepped
[1:41:55] into a vision. They don't know. It's
[1:41:57] just the same day it was before they
[1:41:58] turned the corner and there's the colt
[1:42:00] and there's the rope and here's somebody
[1:42:02] asking and they're loosing and THE WHOLE
[1:42:04] THING NOW THAT WASN'T GOLTHA THAT WASN'T
[1:42:06] GETHSEMANE that wasn't Pilot's judgment
[1:42:08] hall that WASN'T RESURRECTION MORNING
[1:42:10] BUT it mattered
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; it mattered
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; because he HAD TO COME RIDING INTO
[1:42:15] JERUSALEM ON THAT ANIMAL
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; SO I'M HERE TO TELL YOU LISTEN FRIENDS
[1:42:20] IT JOSEPH COULDN'T UNDERSTAND HOW IS HE
[1:42:22] HATED OF HIS BROTHERS HE BROTHER SAID HE
[1:42:24] COULDN'T HELP BEING SPIRITUAL THEY'RE
[1:42:26] REJECTING HIM. THEY'RE PERSECUTING HIM.
[1:42:28] THEY CAST HIM INTO A HOLE. THEY TRY TO
[1:42:30] KILL HIM. THEY SELL HIM. HE GOES INTO
[1:42:31] SLAVERY. FALSE ACCUSED. GOES INTO
[1:42:33] PRISON. YOU THINK HE WANTED TO BE IN
[1:42:35] PRISON? HE DON'T WANT TO BE IN PRISON.
[1:42:36] HE WASN'T DOWN THERE. YOU KNOW, UH, YOU
[1:42:38] KNOW, he loves me. He loves me not. He
[1:42:40] loves me. He loves me not. It had
[1:42:42] nothing to do WITH THAT. JOSEPH WANTED
[1:42:44] OUT. HE SAID TO THE BUTCHER AND THE
[1:42:45] BAKER, "LISTEN, WHEN YOU GET IN FRONT OF
[1:42:46] PHARAOH, DON'T FORGET ME."
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; HE DIDN'T WANT TO BE THERE. LOTS OF
[1:42:50] THINGS WE'RE ENCOUNTERING, WE DON'T SAY,
[1:42:51] "I WISH I HADN'T HAD TO GO THROUGH
[1:42:53] THAT." IT MATTERED.
[1:42:55] OUR TRIALS, OUR UPS AND DOWNS. YOU SAY,
[1:42:58] "BUT A LOT OF THEM I FAILED." BUT EVEN
[1:43:00] THAT MATTERED BECAUSE YOU REPENTED AND
[1:43:02] YOU'RE STILL HERE
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; AND AND THEY'RE SHAKING AROUND THE
[1:43:06] WORLD, BUT WE'RE STILL PRESSING THE
[1:43:07] BATTLE. I'M HERE TO TELL YOU IT ALL
[1:43:09] MATTERED.
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; IT MATTERED ON WHEN ELIJAH WAS ON CARMEL
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; and he PROVED WHO THE TRUE GOD WAS AND
[1:43:17] SLEW ALL THOSE PROPHETS. AND YOU SAY,
[1:43:18] "YEAH, BUT THEN HE HAD TO RUN FOR HIS
[1:43:20] LIFE. IT DIDN'T REALLY MATTER BECAUSE
[1:43:22] JEZEBEL STILL TRIED TO KILL HIM. IT
[1:43:24] DIDN'T CONVERT THE GOVERNMENT. ISRAEL
[1:43:25] STILL BACKSLID. BUT I'M HERE TO TELL YOU
[1:43:27] IT MATTERED FOR 7,000 WHO HAD NOT BOWED
[1:43:30] THE KNEE TO BAAL. AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT
[1:43:32] THE WORLD IS DOING. I KNOW BY THE BOOK
[1:43:34] OF REVELATION, IT'S GOING INTO THE ABYSS
[1:43:36] AND HEADED TO JACOB'S TROUBLE. BUT I
[1:43:38] PLAN TO LEAVE HERE IN A THIRD EXODUS.
[1:43:40] AND I DON'T KNOW WHY WE'RE STILL HERE
[1:43:42] ONE DECADE, TWO DECADES, THREE DECADES,
[1:43:44] FOUR, FIVE, SIX, MOVING ON SEVEN. BUT
[1:43:46] [screaming] IT'S ALL MATTERED. IT'S ALL
[1:43:48] MATTERED. IT'S ALL IT'S ALL IMPORTANT.
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:43:54] I CAN'T EXPLAIN WHY I HAD THIS UP OR
[1:43:57] THAT DOWN, THIS WEAKNESS, THAT FAILURE,
[1:43:59] THIS TRIAL THAT BUT AT THE END OF THE
[1:44:01] DAY,
[1:44:03] SOMETIMES WE'VE WALKED INTO THE DEEPEST,
[1:44:05] DARKEST trials like Joseph.
[1:44:09] I mean, your whole
[1:44:12] life before Christ was a dark trial.
[1:44:16] People are
[1:44:19] so in such revalry of how drunk they can
[1:44:24] get, how many parties and what's their
[1:44:26] body count and all OF THIS KIND OF STUFF
[1:44:28] AND LIVING IT UP AND just not aware at
[1:44:31] all that their candle is burning down
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; every 24 hours.
[1:44:38] AND YOU KNOW, sometimes
[1:44:41] people go through dark trials and hard
[1:44:45] blows, hard blows,
[1:44:48] and they they they leave it as a scar.
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; What's the what's the point of that? ALL
[1:44:57] IF YOU LIVE IN THAT SCAR, ALL THAT'S
[1:44:58] GOING TO DO IS STUNT YOUR GROWTH,
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; PUT YOU IN A LOCKED DOWN POSITION AND
[1:45:04] YOU'LL GO AROUND AND AROUND AND AROUND
[1:45:05] THE REST OF YOUR LIFE COMPLAINING ABOUT
[1:45:06] THIS, COMPLAINING ABOUT THAT, AND YOU'LL
[1:45:08] NEVER BE THE KIND OF SAVIOR. I WOULD
[1:45:10] JUST SAY TO YOU TODAY, COME OUT OF THAT
[1:45:11] TRAFFIC CIRCLE. COME UP OUT OF THAT
[1:45:13] DUNGEON. LIFT UP YOUR HEAD. LET THE
[1:45:15] SUNLIGHT BREAK THROUGH. LIFT UP YOUR
[1:45:16] HEART. LIFT UP. JESUS SAID, "LOOK UP.
[1:45:18] YOUR REDEMPTION DRAWETH NIGH." WALK OUT
[1:45:20] OF THAT THING, FRIENDS. MOVE ON. THERE'S
[1:45:23] NO VALUE IN STAYING BACK THERE UNDER
[1:45:25] THAT THING. IT CAN'T HELP YOU. ALL IT
[1:45:26] CAN DO IS HURT YOU AND POISON THOSE
[1:45:28] AROUND YOU. GOD HAS CALLED US TO LIBERTY
[1:45:31] AND TO FREEDOM IN THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; I COULD LAMENT EVERY FAILURE I HAVE, BUT
[1:45:37] I I CONCENTRATE RATHER ON HOW MANY TIMES
[1:45:39] I REPENTED, HOW MANY TIMES HE FORGAVE
[1:45:41] ME, HOW MANY TIMES I WALKED OUT AND INTO
[1:45:44] THE SUNLIGHT AND A TRIAL WAS OVER AND A
[1:45:46] WEAKNESS WAS OVER AND I NEVER HAD TO GO
[1:45:48] BACK TO THAT PRISON AGAIN.
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; THESE THINGS MATTER. THEY ALL MATTERED.
[1:45:55] EVERYTHING WE'VE ENDURED MATTERS.
[1:45:58] SOMETIMES IF YOU TRY TO SUGGEST EVEN FOR
[1:46:01] A MOMENT,
[1:46:03] OH, this thing will never end.
[1:46:08] This trial,
[1:46:10] this weakness,
[1:46:12] THIS STUMBLE, THIS CONSEQUENCE. I want
[1:46:16] you to know something, friends. It will
[1:46:18] end.
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; They will end.
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; They must end. God will make them end.
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; And we are looking at a day just ahead
[1:46:27] of us. Oh, hallelujah. Our future is
[1:46:30] unstoppably bright. Our future there
[1:46:33] there there is a new day dawning a new
[1:46:37] DAY OF ETERNITY. OH, AND I I I DON'T
[1:46:40] KNOW. WE MAY NOT BE BURNING UP THE WORLD
[1:46:42] LIKE BROTHER BRANDHAM DID, BUT I'M I'M
[1:46:45] QUIETLY MARCHING TO ZION. And every day
[1:46:48] I just TAKE ANOTHER STEP. WHAT ARE YOU
[1:46:50] GOING TO DO TOMORROW? I DON'T KNOW. I'M
[1:46:51] JUST GOING TO TAKE ANOTHER STEP. OR WHAT
[1:46:52] IF THIS HAPPENS? I'LL JUST KEEP TAKING A
[1:46:54] STEP. I MIGHT GO IN IT AND I'LL STEP
[1:46:56] THROUGH IT AND STEP OUT OF IT AND AND I
[1:46:58] MIGHT FACE ANOTHER ONE, BUT SOMEDAY I'LL
[1:47:00] STEP LIKE ENOCH. I'LL STEP INTO ANOTHER
[1:47:02] REALM.
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I'M DETERMINED TO SERVE HIM.
[1:47:05] I'M DETERMINED TO SERVE HIM.
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; NO MATTER COME WHAT MAY, I I'M HERE TO
[1:47:10] TELL YOU FRIENDS, IT IT IT WE WE SEE HOW
[1:47:12] IT ALL PLAYS OUT. AND I DON'T I don't I
[1:47:16] don't plan to [gasps]
[1:47:18] I don't plan to think uh we're going to
[1:47:22] meet under a bridge
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; or we're all going to GATHER IN SOME
[1:47:26] GINORMOUS CATHEDRAL THAT'S GOING TO hold
[1:47:28] the entire bride around the world. At
[1:47:30] least not in this dimension.
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; IF WE GOT ONE COMING IN ANOTHER
[1:47:35] DIMENSION, I'LL BE ON THE FRONT ROW. I
[1:47:37] PROMISE YOU THAT. I'm not going to MISS
[1:47:39] IT. I WOULDN'T MISS HEAVEN FOR THE
[1:47:41] WORLD.
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; Would you? AMEN.
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; YOU WOULDN'T MISS HEAVEN FOR THE WORLD,
[1:47:46] WOULD YOU?
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; OH MY GOODNESS, FRIENDS. MY DAILY goal
[1:47:50] is to do the will of God for my life to
[1:47:55] complete my mission. I say as Paul said
[1:47:59] in the book of Hebrews concerning
[1:48:01] Christ, it is written of me in the
[1:48:04] scrolls concerning me, I have come to do
[1:48:09] thy will, O Lord. Amen.
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; Say, "I had this setback. You just don't
[1:48:21] know what I've been through." You don't
[1:48:23] know what I've been through.
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; You don't know what the person beside
[1:48:27] you's been through.
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; Maybe maybe they just have gotten more
[1:48:31] victory while you're still crying in a
[1:48:33] puddle.
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; And I'm not I'm NOT MINIMIZING YOUR LOSS
[1:48:38] or your trial. I've had some deep
[1:48:40] losses,
[1:48:42] deep trials,
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; things that would be regrettable, things
[1:48:47] that a lot of times I visited on my own
[1:48:50] self. And and BUT BUT BUT
[1:48:53] REGARDLESS OF OF WHAT I DID TO MYSELF OR
[1:48:57] GOD ALLOW THE DEVIL TO DO LIKE HE DID
[1:48:59] Israel for correction, REGARDLESS OF
[1:49:01] WHAT HAD HAPPENED, I'M NOT GOING TO STAY
[1:49:03] STUCK.
[1:49:05] I'M NOT COME ON, FRIENDS. DON'T STAY
[1:49:07] STUCK IN THAT. THAT THING WILL JUST LOCK
[1:49:10] YOU DOWN. YOU'LL HAVE SPIRITUAL AMNESIA.
[1:49:12] YOU'LL LOSE YOUR SPIRITUAL IDENTITY.
[1:49:13] WE'RE HERE TO BE SAVIORS TO THE WORLD
[1:49:16] EVERY 24 HOURS. LISTEN, YOU YOU MAY HAVE
[1:49:18] HAD YOU MAY HAVE HAD MANY
[1:49:19] DISCOURAGEMENTS, BUT I COULD JUST SAY TO
[1:49:21] YOU TODAY, IF YOU COULD TALK TO JOSEPH
[1:49:23] AND SAY, "WAS ALL OF THOSE
[1:49:25] DISCOURAGEMENTS WORTH IT?" HE WOULD SAY,
[1:49:27] "YES, EVERY LAST ONE OF THEM WAS WORTH
[1:49:29] IT." AND IT TOOK ME A WHILE TO
[1:49:31] UNDERSTAND IT. IT SEEMED BAD. IT SEEMED
[1:49:33] IMPOSSIBLE. AND LATER ON, I BEGAN TO
[1:49:36] REALIZE WHAT YOU THOUGHT, WHAT THE DEVIL
[1:49:38] THOUGHT FOR EVIL, GOD [screaming]
[1:49:39] THOUGHT IT FOR MY GOOD. I'M HERE TO TELL
[1:49:42] YOU SOMETHING, FRIENDS. EVERY 24 HOURS,
[1:49:44] LUCIFER IS THAT MUCH CLOSER TO FAILURE.
[1:49:47] AND EVERY 24 HOURS, I'M THAT MUCH CLOSER
[1:49:50] TO THE RESURRECTION. HALLELUJAH. BECAUSE
[1:49:53] THE VISION IS YET FOR AN APPOINTED TIME,
[1:49:56] BUT AT [screaming] THE END IT SHALL
[1:49:58] SPEAK AND NOT LIE. THOUGH IT TAR, WAIT
[1:50:01] FOR IT, BECAUSE IT SURELY WILL COME.
[1:50:05] LUCIFER'S CLAIM WILL FAIL. IT MUST FAIL.
[1:50:09] IT IS FAILING. HALLELUJAH. I'M HERE TO
[1:50:12] BE A LIVING REPRESENTATIVE OF WHAT GOD
[1:50:15] SAID THAT I WILL DWELL WITH MY PEOPLE
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; AND I'LL HAVE A NEW HEAVENS AND A NEW
[1:50:21] EARTH. AND I JUST SAY BLESSED BE THE
[1:50:24] NAME OF THE LORD. LET MY LIFE NOT STAY
[1:50:26] SILENT. [screaming] LET MY LIFE BE A
[1:50:28] LIVING blast
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; to the WORLD AROUND ME. STAND. GOD BLESS
