can be seated this morning i'm going to show just an eight-minute video that is not the best video i could find but it was good enough to just teach us just a little bit of history and i believe it's important to understand who the the context not just the writer as we talked a lot about james the writer we talked a little bit about his letter what he wrote last time we spoke on this now we want to talk about the context of why he wrote what he wrote and to understand who the book was written to verse one let's look at it again here together paul's that just for a moment just have it have it ready that's fine james one verse one let's read it again james a servant of god and of the lord jesus christ to the 12 tribes which are scattered abroad so this is what the jewish history refers to as the dispersion we know the first dispersion was under babylon when they were exiled from jerusalem and sent into babylon and they were taken captive and then even after cyrus uh through nehemiah and through ezra allows them to go and rebuild the temple yet some jews stays in babylon some jews goes back some of the jews went back uh to rebuild the temple but that was the first dispersion and you're gonna hear a lot about that and you're gonna and it's gonna help you understand a little bit just the history of a journey and i could have chose many different videos and this one's a little bit childish so we're teaching sunday school and so just to be like children here this morning this might be in uh animated and they've got some funny music in the background but i believe it does a good job uh just just just uh exploring some of the history of the jewish people and what they call the dispersion they have another word for that but what is called the dispersion because this is intricate it's uni it's very uh it's very uh an important part of jewish culture and what the jews believe today about um how their entire history from all the way from the exodus where they're taken into taken into egypt and made slaves and then they're they're brought through in exodus on a journey out of egypt uh through to the promised land and all the way to the time when jesus comes on the scene do you realize that the bible says that at the fullness of time that jesus came and that when jesus came the timing was perfect god doesn't do anything happen uh haphazardly or just randomly but when jesus comes on the scene it's the perfect time do you realize that the the reason why that the jews were dispersed that jesus when jesus comes on the scene you have the roman empire he didn't come before but now you have the roman empire and what is rome one of the one of the things that rome was most popular for was roman roads so prior to the roman empire there were no roads so now there's roads and now there's a greek language that's universal among the entire world and the jews are now dispersed not not from babylon but the second dispersion and the jews are scattered across the entire mediterranean so jews are scattered there's roads and everyone speaks the same language and then jesus comes on the scene at the right time and now there's roads for the gospel to spread to the entire world and and jews aren't just huddled in one spot in jerusalem but now they're fragmented everywhere and it was god who set it up that way at the right time go ahead and play that video for me this is just going to be just a little lesson here eight minutes long go ahead make sure it has plenty of volume and conflicts this video will trace their stories back to the time of judah kingdom after the death of king solomon in 931 bc the united monarchy was split into the kingdom of israel and the kingdom of judah in 722 bc the kingdom of israel was invaded by the assyrians the remaining population fled to the kingdom of judah and its capital city jerusalem the region was put under the control of the assyrians for a century until 612 bc when the assyrian empire was overthrown by the babylonians in 586 bc babylon conquered judah solomon's temple was demolished and the jews were exiled to babylon in 538 bc babylon fell to the persian aka minute empire the new king cyrus the great decreed freedom to subjugated nations the jews in babylon returned to judah where they rebuilt the city and organized the foundations of jewish culture with the reconstruction of solomon's temple and the writing of torah part of the jewish bible two centuries later alexander the great of macedon made a conquest of the acamented empire after the success due to the death of alexander at a young age the empire was divided among his generals into various hellenic kingdoms following the incorporation of judea into the seleucid kingdom in 198 bc the crack between the religious jews and hellenized jews emerged this was a time of religious struggle as the jewish population split under the reign of king antiochus iv the second temple which was built on the ruin of solomon's temple was desecrated due to the set up of a pagan altar to zeus in 165 bc the religion-driven revolt against the seleucid empire and the hellenistic impact on jewish life had started the success of the revolt led to the establishment of a jewish independent rule the hasmonean dynasty a century later the roman conquered the region triggering two major revolts the great revolt from the year of 66 to 73 resulted in the destruction of the second temple and the downfall of jerusalem walls except for the western wall only the second major revolt from 132 to 135 led to the massive jewish depopulation as 580 000 jews were perished in battle not including those who succumbed to diseases and hunger after this war the jewish communities were devastated but the remaining population was strong and thriving in galilee where they migrated to after being barred from jerusalem the romans gave the name palestine to judea with a view to breaking the jewish connection with the land of israel during this time christianity which started off as a jewish sect ultimately became a distinct religion it was the dominant religion towards the end of the roman empire between the 4th and the early 7th century under the byzantine and visigoths empire the thriving jewish community in the mediterranean basin was subjected to the persecution and forced conversion to christianity after the birth of islam an arab conquest began and to some extent the jews support it in the hope of better conditions they were tolerated by the arabs forced conversion was only applied to polytheistic people the dome of the rock was built on the ruin of the second temple making jerusalem the holy city to three monotheistic religions judaism christianity and islam jewish communities were tolerated and gradually established all over western europe as the new millennium approached in 1099 christians in europe launched several crusades to bring the holy city back to the hands of the christians after christians in jerusalem were intensely persecuted by the seljuk turks a central asian people with a strong desire for the expansion on their way they massacred the jews who they considered to be killers of jesus between 1346 and 1353 the jews were scapegoated as the cause of black death the disease that killed half of the european population in just five years they were accused of poisoning wells persecuted along the rhine and rhone region and eventually expelled after the reconquista ends in 1492 the expulsion in spain began and the ottoman empire became the main new land that the jews chose to settle in in nearly 30 years from 1520 the walls of jerusalem were rebuilt and the jewish population in jerusalem expanded during the 16th century the polish-lithuanian commonwealth adopted favorable migration policies making it a new haven for the jews from western europe in the early 17th century about half of the world's jewish population settled in the region however the kumalnitsky uprising in ukraine between 1648 and 1654 changed everything being accused of having a privileged relationship with those in power the jews were slaughtered in less than two years the ukrainians killed between one hundred thousand to three hundred thousand jews and spread their massacres to other countries over the next ten years toward the end of the eighteenth century the polish-lithuanian commonwealth weakened and eventually collapsed the russians acquired its territories the jewish community was divided and nine hundred thousand jews were in the russian empire unwelcomed during the first half of the 19th century the jews were cruelly killed in pogroms violent riots that demonstrated the russians anti-jewish wave after that the immigration to the united states and western europe began there the living condition of the jews was vastly improved the first zionist congress in late 19th century took place and strived for the creation of a home that secured by law in palestine for jewish people this idea was fiercely opposed by the ottoman empire after world war one erupted the ottoman empire sided with the german empire in the effort of garnering support for the allies the british minister of foreign affairs issued the balfour declaration promising the jews a national home in palestine in return for the support from the zionist movement concurrently britain supported the great arab revolt against the ottoman empire by promising them independence in the liberated territories after world war one following the increasing jewish population in palestine jewish arab tension and violence escalated world war ii broke out and claimed almost 6 million lives of the jews in the holocaust after the war fierce opposition of jews and arabs prompted an overwhelm britain to withdraw from the region the u.n partition plan proposed to split this british mandate into an arab state a jewish state and the city of jerusalem right after the adoption of the plan due to the rejection of the arab league a civil war between the arabs and the jews broke out on may 14 1948 with the declaration of independence by david ben-gurion a jewish state the state of israel was established in response the arabs declared the first arab-israeli war from this year onwards israel has also engaged in various military conflicts including suez crisis six day war yom kippur war and two lebanon wars the israeli-palestine conflict which has its roots from the mid-20th century is still ongoing today also since the establishment of israel its jewish population has doubled as waves of jewish immigration landed on this territory despite the constant instability due to long-running conflicts amid political turmoil israel home of the largest part of the jewish world population has been thriving economically thank you for watching please like share and don't forget to subscribe to our channel for the daily update look at james now we're gonna paul we're gonna that brought us all the way up to date but going back to when james writes let's read it again together james chapter 1 verse 1 now you understand when he says a servant of god and of our lord jesus christ to the 12 tribes which are scattered abroad scattered abroad so this is the mediterranean jews that james is writing this to now it's amazing because there's always been this struggle when you look at jewish history of isolation too much isolation and too much too much assimilation and striking the balance in between those two is the struggle of not just jews but of believers because some jews chose to be like the jews in jerusalem who never left jerusalem and they stayed isolated huddled up in one spot and never left because there's a there's a sense of if we just close our sort of like the amish if we just close our ears and close our eyes and just keep everybody you know huddled up together you know in one commune then we're we're free from the outside invasion of things that don't align with our culture our or our beliefs sounds reasonable the problem is is that salvation the the people whose salvation is to come through is you and i and so it sounds reasonable except that the bible says who takes a candle and sits it under a bush so that no one can see it so under extreme isolation how are you going to save anybody amen and so people get isolated and they get into a little huddle and and you be that you you see the seeds of legalism even there and there's there's no there's there's no way for a jew to who who is going to come the redemption of the world there's no way for that to ever spread if they're so isolated then you have the jews not the jews who were isolated and they were they were they were they were um choking and preventing and hindering the gospel from spreading but then you have the jews who went into the world and lived amongst the people and lived that's why jews were you see from this video is they travel that's why jews you find jews in um in in seamstress and and and sowers why because you could pack up your goods because they were constantly on the move and traveling that's why you find jews as jewelers because the same exact reason some of the trades that they that the jews are in business are most popular with are things that are easy low impact they could pick up they can leave and so jews went into business and they were very successful in business very successful in fact in medieval uh times christians weren't allowed to uh to that's why the jews are in charge of the money in the banks because jews were allowed and permitted to handle the money and so it's a it's it's an isol jews who were isolated in a world unto themselves and then you have jews who went into the world and then they become assimilated to where you can't tell them apart from anybody else so because of the scattering abroad where they were scattered everywhere there's this sense of fear that we're gonna lose our culture we're gonna lose uh we're just we're just gonna fade off into history and so that's why you see the traditions held by truth by jews and rabbis to where jewish tradition is and they and even the some of the things that we we we were seeing in the video here about the dispersion some of the some of the the reason why religion or religious ceremony is so important to jews is a effort to not lose what they believe amongst their children and their grandchildren and so you have on one side them that get too isolated and on the other side them to get that they get too assimilated and they're like anybody else and if we're not careful as believers we could fall into one or those two categories ourself to where we're so isolated that we don't have anything to do with anybody yet we're the vessels of mercy and of grace for the gospel to come through us yet if you go the other way and you're too assimilated then how does the world even know and you become so much like the world that they can't tell you apart from anybody except the fact that you might come to church on sunday and then who do you invite hello somebody so there was always this struggle that you see here and this is james let me just get back to my text here james when he says he's right into the 12 tribes which are scattered abroad and uh greeting his nickname or he's given a name james the just what a wonderful name to be given to be just means to be fair he was a fair person he didn't favor anybody there was no favoritism god i'm thankful that god's given us good leaders and we should thank god for good leaders who are not favored favoritism to groups or to classes but are just we should be just we should be people who are just and fair equitable to everybody this is what james starts you see in some of his some of the verses you'll read especially in chapter one and two against the rich and so james is talking about the rich how that you they would they would literally have people who had more money and let me just say this by the way by new testament standards everyone in this room is rich right by new testament standards by new testament church standards were all the rich who jesus said it was impossible you imagine the deceitfulness of riches and it's an impossible for a rich man to enter into the into the kingdom of heaven and james covers this exact same thing because there was a sense of of there was there was deceitfulness but there was a false sense of security to those who had wealth and so james says you allow the people to come into your churches and you seat the rich in the front then you let the poor just go into the you know sit somewhere in the back and so he's crying out against that kind of favoritism to say you you shouldn't do that because the rich and the poor there's no classes in the kingdom of god there's they're no more important and riches has a sense of of uh the bias why the bible calls it the deceitfulness has a way to deceive people into believing that they're somehow because of their money they're successful and then those who don't have money are somehow not successful or a failure in life you see how deceiving that is it's amazing because when you look at the life of of of james and the bible called the the the scripture calls him and his nickname even another another nickname that i can't pronounce that he's given if you studied his history through josephus it means a bulwark he's a he's a pillar in so much that he's he's put as the overseer of the jewish of the church in jerusalem and he's he's he is he's he holds that position he's even called an apostle in galatians chapter one he wasn't one of the twelve but he's made an overseer by the apostles and and throughout his entire life until the time he dies he remains in that position now he dies in a.d 62. and so his you read the account of him as a martyr and there's multiple accounts that you can read uh of james and his martyrdom and i'm just going to cover just a minute just for a minute here before we close but he's the the bible or the history records that he dies in a.d 62. i'm not going to pronounce some of these names right so you scholars will have to forgive me i'm just going to give it my southern english um hegesippus which is a second century christian and there's not a lot known about him but he's quoted by in the in in in the ecclesiastical history volume two if you look at chapter 23 it gives the account of his of of of his martyrdom and it's incredible because you look at what i'm just going to read literally i'm going to read verbatim this account from history josephus also if you're if you ever study or look at the writings of josephus a jewish historian he covers also an account of the martyrdom of james and it's pretty incredible because james and i'm just going to read it here for a moment but james uh there's there's a gap in between roman rulers and in that gap where there's uh no ruler that was benevolent or kind to the jews they murdered james and i'm just going to read some of it here so just bear with me i would have put it on the screen but but i didn't have time it says after a while james influence became so strong that even some of the rulers believed which horrified the scribes and pharisees they became afraid that soon the people would be flocking to jesus as the christ somehow perhaps because of his strict observance to the law the pharisees thought they could get james to discourage the people from believing they asked him to stand at the pinnacle of the temple on passover and speak this is amazing because where did in the wilderness did satan take jesus to the pinnacle of the temple remember and he says cast yourself down throw yourself down for surely the angels will bear thee up and not allow thee to dash thy foot and that would have been true for jesus it wasn't true for james james was going to be cast from that pinnacle and and he was going to die now this is this is just one account of many of the early christians who suffered and were martyrs for the name of christ it goes on it says they asked him to stand at the pinnacle apparently james agreed they brought him to the top of the temple and they shouted to him from below o righteous one in whom we are able to place great confidence the people are let us stray after jesus the crucified ones so declare to us what is this way jesus obviously there wasn't obviously this wasn't a very wise thing for them to do james was ready to take full advantage of such a wonderful opportunity as this his words are memorable mrs james why do you ask me about jesus the son of man he sits in heaven at the right hand of the great power and he will soon come on the clouds of heaven the pharisees were horrified but the people were not they begin shouting hosanna the son of david the pharisees realizing the awful mistake they'd made begin crying out oh the righteous one is also an error so they they tried to set him up to go to the top of the temple and denounce jesus but james says this is a perfect opportunity to spread the gospel and he begins to to to what we just read here is he begins to preach to the people and now the pharisees horrified says the righteous one also is an error you can probably guess that this had little effect on the crowd so the next obvious thing to do was to push him down from the temple letting the people know exactly what happens to those who dare to believe in jesus they climbed the temples as the people shouted reach the they they climbed the temples the temple as the people shouted reached the top and threw james from the pinnacle of the temple it didn't kill him he rose to his knees and this is amazing because this is from four accounts you could read four accounts of history and all four different from different writers all had the same exact and agree on the same exact account of the death of james he rose to his knees and began to pray for them i beg of you this is james lord god our father forgive them they do not know what they are doing this would not do the pharisees on the ground begin to stone him as he prayed while those from the roof rushed down to join the execution one of the priests however a son mentioned by jeremiah the prophet shouted stop what are you doing the righteous one is praying for you it was too late a fuller took out one of the clubs that he used to beat clothes and smashed james had james on the head killing him with one blow history goes on to record that is they take the body of james and here's here's the the jews and they take the body of james and for the first time they show is gideon still in the booth josh can you show that picture go ahead and show that they show james and they see his knees and this is the historical record that they they they commented and said his knees look like camel's knees you ever seen camel's knees this is what i had gideon bring up just a an image of this and if he gets it good you can if not you can google it on your phone camel's knees i thought that was incredible when i read that because i we don't have camels around here and i couldn't remember i always remember the picture of a camel when he's on the ground
