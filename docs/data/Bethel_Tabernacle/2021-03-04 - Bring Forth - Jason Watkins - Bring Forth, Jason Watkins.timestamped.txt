[45:07] those

[45:13] you have it say amen
[45:18] in the beginning god created the heaven
[45:21] and the earth
[45:22] and the earth was without form and void
[45:25] darkness was upon the face of the deep
[45:28] the spirit of god moved upon the face of
[45:30] the waters and god said
[45:32] let there be light and there was light
[45:35] and god saw the light that it was good
[45:37] and god divided the light from the
[45:39] darkness
[45:40] and god called the light day and the
[45:42] darkness he called night
[45:44] and the evening and the morning or the
[45:46] first day
[45:47] isn't that beautiful and god said
[45:51] let there be a firmament in the midst of
[45:54] the waters and let it divide the waters
[45:55] from the waters
[45:56] and god made the firmament and divided
[45:58] the waters which were
[46:00] under the firmament from the waters
[46:02] which were above the firmament
[46:04] and it was so and god called the
[46:07] firmament heaven
[46:08] in the evening in the morning or the
[46:10] second day
[46:12] and god said let the waters under the
[46:15] heaven be gathered together into one
[46:16] place and let the dry land appear
[46:19] and it was so and god called the dry
[46:22] land earth and the gathering together of
[46:24] the waters
[46:25] called he seas and god saw that it was
[46:28] good
[46:29] and god said let the earth bring forth
[46:33] grass
[46:34] the herb yielding seed and the fruit
[46:37] tree yielding fruit after his kind
[46:40] whose seed is in itself upon the earth
[46:44] and it was so i love the word of god
[46:48] i'm taking a text tonight from that 11th
[46:51] verse and god

[50:10] seated
[50:22] you know it's the first time you will
[50:25] find
[50:26] in the bible that
[50:29] this term these two words get chained
[50:31] together
[50:32] bring forth it fittingly
[50:36] begins in genesis fittingly in the very
[50:38] first chapter of genesis
[50:41] and in fact is in the book of genesis
[50:44] it's used exactly seven times
[50:47] it's used five times here
[50:50] in the garden of eden and
[50:54] and then after the fall and then
[50:58] god says to eve on the fifth time in
[51:01] sorrow you'll bring forth but
[51:04] and then it's used twice again in
[51:07] genesis
[51:08] and when noah is told to gather
[51:12] and bring forth all of the animals into
[51:15] the ark and then he's after the ark
[51:18] he's given a command the same command i
[51:20] believe
[51:21] in its fourth usage in the book of
[51:23] genesis
[51:24] when when god calls for be fruitful
[51:28] and multiply bring forth and so
[51:31] we realize that genesis has these
[51:33] perfect seven
[51:34] sequences perfect seven times
[51:38] of this idea i think that i could say to
[51:41] you tonight
[51:42] if god planted seed he intends for it to
[51:46] bring forth if god went to the trouble
[51:51] to speak and here he
[51:54] speaks to a world that's that that
[51:57] that's
[51:57] without form and it's void and darkness
[52:01] is covering the face of the deep
[52:03] and and the spirit of god moved
[52:06] and god said and you know what he was
[52:09] trying to get to
[52:10] bring forth once he says it in the 11th
[52:13] verse
[52:14] he says it again and again and again and
[52:17] he'll come and he'll say
[52:18] let it bring forth and this this this
[52:20] this let it bring forth
[52:22] i'm going to tell you something friends
[52:25] you know
[52:25] you can have a pretty good
[52:28] assessment of yourself
[52:33] but of course that's kind of given to
[52:34] yourself by yourself about yourself
[52:37] amen and paul warns us not to do that in
[52:41] second corinthians chapter 10
[52:44] verse 12 paul says for we dare not make
[52:47] ourselves of the number
[52:49] or compare ourselves with some that
[52:51] commend themselves
[52:52] but they measuring themselves by
[52:54] themselves and comparing themselves
[52:56] among themselves are not wise i don't
[53:00] want to make that mistake
[53:03] you know i i let me let me take another
[53:05] step here
[53:08] you know not only might you have
[53:12] a fair self-assessment and say you know
[53:15] i'm
[53:16] i'm doing pretty good others could have
[53:18] an assessment of you
[53:20] that's often times what we run into and
[53:22] a lot of times you get
[53:23] you you can become alarmed if someone's
[53:26] assessment of you
[53:28] doesn't match the assessment you thought
[53:29] of you amen
[53:32] so you you can the devil can really come
[53:35] and battle you uh you know and but but i
[53:39] want to say this friends that
[53:41] while you may have a self-assessment you
[53:45] may have all the confidence in the world
[53:47] in that assessment others may have a
[53:49] different opinion of you
[53:51] and what kind of person you are
[53:55] but really the only measuring standard
[53:58] that has
[53:59] any validity at all is actually
[54:03] buried very deep inside you
[54:09] it's a seed that god
[54:12] placed in you just like in genesis
[54:17] and he says in the 11th verse and god
[54:20] said let the earth bring forth grass and
[54:22] herb yielding seed
[54:24] and the fruit tree yielding fruit after
[54:27] his kind not after the other guy's kind
[54:29] after his kind are not after a different
[54:32] version
[54:33] of this but after what god made it to be
[54:37] amen
[54:39] so fruit tree
[54:43] yielding fruit after his kind whose seed
[54:45] is in itself
[54:46] upon the earth and it was so so i'm here
[54:48] to tell you something friends god built
[54:50] you amen
[54:53] and there is a seed inside you that
[54:56] is the real you and so i want to suggest
[55:00] to you tonight
[55:01] that it it really has very little
[55:04] bearing what you think of you
[55:07] amen and how how
[55:11] happy you are with whatever success you
[55:13] think you have found in life
[55:15] and you might really believe that you
[55:17] are you are
[55:18] you are it and you've got it and you
[55:21] know it and you're on the move
[55:22] and then somebody and and somebody else
[55:25] could have the same opinion and pat you
[55:27] on the back and go yeah you're really
[55:28] something or the other guy could say
[55:30] no you're not what you think you are or
[55:32] you might even
[55:33] have a low self-esteem but i'm here to
[55:36] tell you the only thing that counts
[55:38] is there's a god who put the seed there
[55:40] and that's what he's watching
[55:41] and are you are you not me not your
[55:44] person beside you
[55:45] are you bringing forth the life
[55:49] in the seed that god put in you
[55:53] is your life moving according to god's
[55:58] motive for building you
[56:03] and his objective for you to arrive at
[56:07] i just want you to know something
[56:08] friends
[56:10] there is nothing more important in this
[56:13] life
[56:14] than for you to bring forth everything
[56:17] god is calling from your life
[56:22] i cannot speak to what it might cost you
[56:26] i cannot speak to what you might have to
[56:28] give up
[56:29] separate join two move here go
[56:32] there come what may stand up sit down
[56:35] i don't know i that's it's not my job to
[56:38] know that i'm just giving you a
[56:40] principle of god's word
[56:41] you will never chase the world
[56:44] chase the wind acquire whatever you can
[56:47] but you will never know true peace and
[56:49] true satisfaction
[56:50] until you lay your head on your pillow
[56:52] at night and the last thing you're going
[56:54] to sleep is you're thanking god
[56:56] and you have a confidence that you are
[56:58] resting
[56:59] in his will for
[57:02] your life and that the seed he placed in
[57:06] you
[57:07] he doesn't require you to manifest my
[57:10] seed
[57:11] he requires it of me
[57:14] and we're not to compare ourselves to
[57:16] ourselves or even to other people
[57:18] we have one standard to compare
[57:20] ourselves to and that's god's word
[57:22] and whatever god's word that's his will
[57:25] brother branham said his word is his
[57:26] will
[57:27] it's not up for you know uh
[57:30] debate or argument god's word is his
[57:32] will period
[57:34] and so because of that then we have an
[57:37] upper we have
[57:37] we have an advantage if you'll take it
[57:39] if you'll take a prophet
[57:41] saying his will is his word your life
[57:43] will be a lot smoother
[57:46] because you won't always be second
[57:48] guessing it you'll just look in his word
[57:49] and you'll see
[57:51] well this must be what he wants from me
[57:53] because it lines with his word
[57:56] and a lot of times problems the problem
[57:58] comes and i've seen it happen
[58:00] more times than i'm comfortable with
[58:02] that people running along in a certain
[58:04] path
[58:04] and they come to make a decision and the
[58:06] decision they're about to make
[58:08] is gonna is gonna completely cross
[58:10] thread
[58:12] this it's not it's not gonna be
[58:15] you remember the church is a bunch of
[58:17] nuts screwed onto the bolt
[58:19] and you cross those threads and you'll
[58:21] never get it you'll ruin it
[58:24] and and i just when i was speaking on
[58:25] that here recently i just want to tell
[58:27] you tonight
[58:27] stop trying to take a a bigger wrench
[58:31] to make your to make the bolt
[58:35] fit you stop doing that all you're going
[58:38] to do is ruin the nut
[58:41] and you're going to harm the bolt so
[58:43] that even when you try to do it right
[58:45] it's not going to go on very smoothly
[58:47] don't do that
[58:48] ask the lord say lord what have you
[58:50] planted me here in the earth to be
[58:52] what have you planted me to do what have
[58:54] you planted me to believe
[58:55] and cause my life to go that way
[58:59] and i don't even need to see what's
[59:00] going to happen tomorrow i'm already
[59:02] knowing on this side
[59:03] when i get there i'm going to want your
[59:04] word i don't care what it is
[59:08] this is a genesis effect this
[59:12] is bringing forth according to what
[59:15] god's purpose was
[59:18] for you and me
[59:22] brother branham in the message influence
[59:24] and he preaches it again in influences
[59:26] in various places and
[59:27] talks about this theme in in other
[59:30] messages as well
[59:33] picks up the story of isaiah as a young
[59:35] man
[59:38] and how that you know he
[59:42] he really got his world rocked when
[59:45] when uzziah the king who he's friends
[59:47] with and so admired and he was
[59:49] he was he was isaiah's hero and
[59:52] isaiah had had leaned so heavy on the
[59:55] arm of flesh and
[59:57] felt himself you know isaiah had a
[59:59] pretty good assessment of his own life
[1:00:01] and
[1:00:02] pretty good assessment of his ministry
[1:00:04] and he's born a prophet
[1:00:08] and you don't get to graduate to be a
[1:00:10] prophet you're born that way
[1:00:12] and so he's already a prophet he's not
[1:00:14] going to graduate he didn't become a
[1:00:16] prophet because he was the
[1:00:17] friend of the king he was born a prophet
[1:00:20] and his life
[1:00:22] his life found favor in the king so he
[1:00:24] had a very good assessment of his life
[1:00:26] and he's just a young man
[1:00:28] he had a very good assessment of his
[1:00:30] ministry he had a very good assessment
[1:00:32] of his relationships
[1:00:35] man i'm tight with the king
[1:00:39] i'm i'm well liked
[1:00:42] i i've got a great ministry i'm a good
[1:00:45] person
[1:00:46] you know happy day isn't it beautiful
[1:00:48] today how are you
[1:00:50] wasn't it a lovely day oh yes it's a
[1:00:51] wonderful day and you know what happened
[1:00:53] every bit of that he didn't realize here
[1:00:55] that was the critical part
[1:00:57] all it took was pulling
[1:01:01] one one peg out and the whole thing
[1:01:05] came crashing down and uzziah
[1:01:08] commits a sin and then and then
[1:01:12] it and then as as if it wasn't that
[1:01:14] wasn't bad enough
[1:01:15] then he doubled down on his sin and he
[1:01:18] got angry
[1:01:20] and then he got leprosy and then we find
[1:01:23] that
[1:01:24] he literally had to leave the palace
[1:01:28] and that he had to go live in a leper
[1:01:31] colony
[1:01:32] and i would love i would love to tell
[1:01:36] you
[1:01:36] oh isaiah got anointed and he went in
[1:01:40] there with them with the
[1:01:41] with the mantle and uh and he had you
[1:01:43] know with here he come to say i'm
[1:01:45] telling you what we're going to do
[1:01:46] uh your majesty we're going i'm going to
[1:01:48] call on jehovah and all you got to do is
[1:01:49] repent
[1:01:50] and then and then uzziah you know
[1:01:53] repented and
[1:01:54] and they came out with their arms around
[1:01:55] one another and israel had a big jubilee
[1:01:57] and he went back on the throne
[1:01:59] that would be wonderful except none of
[1:02:00] that happened amen
[1:02:03] amen the king died in that leper house
[1:02:11] i i was going to title this tonight and
[1:02:14] and
[1:02:15] and i i was even going to use it as a
[1:02:17] subtitle and then i
[1:02:18] finally pushed it off to sunday but i'm
[1:02:20] gonna i'm gonna
[1:02:21] continue this theme on bringing forth
[1:02:24] the lord willing
[1:02:26] but i i want to take a a different
[1:02:29] subtitle
[1:02:30] and i want to subtitle it consequences
[1:02:35] because and i'm going to talk about it
[1:02:36] just a little bit tonight
[1:02:39] because here you're seeing now it's not
[1:02:41] the first time in the bible you'd see
[1:02:43] consequences i mean
[1:02:44] from the garden of eden you know when
[1:02:46] adam and eve are walking
[1:02:48] out with bloody sheepskins
[1:02:51] and eve is crying and adam with his arm
[1:02:53] around her and they're going out and
[1:02:54] they're crying and god is crying and
[1:02:56] nature's crying i want to tell you that
[1:02:58] was quite a consequence
[1:03:01] from from somebody not bringing forth
[1:03:04] according to the way god told them to
[1:03:07] bring forth
[1:03:08] plunge the whole world into sin we're
[1:03:11] suffering from it
[1:03:12] to this hour so there's plenty of
[1:03:16] consequences and and and and i think
[1:03:19] that
[1:03:20] i could have just taken a year and just
[1:03:24] went
[1:03:24] almost chapter by chapter through the
[1:03:26] entire old testament how many
[1:03:28] consequences
[1:03:29] god's people who he loved
[1:03:32] suffered consequences because they
[1:03:35] didn't
[1:03:36] bring forth according to god's will
[1:03:40] they chris they crisscrossed their life
[1:03:42] they got god's
[1:03:44] purpose in the seed that he put in them
[1:03:47] they got it mingled too strongly with
[1:03:49] their own will in their own way and i
[1:03:50] don't know what it
[1:03:51] caused it maybe it was raising maybe it
[1:03:53] was culture maybe it was politics i
[1:03:55] don't know what it was
[1:03:56] but i know that over and over and over
[1:03:58] again israel
[1:04:00] prophets kings priests israel as a
[1:04:02] nation
[1:04:03] suffered tremendous consequences
[1:04:06] david numbers the people look at how
[1:04:08] many was the consequence of that
[1:04:10] thousands die
[1:04:12] amen and we find that
[1:04:15] here the king what a lesson
[1:04:19] to isaiah that it was about
[1:04:24] consequences
[1:04:27] that how that he had
[1:04:30] really been knocked for a loop by the
[1:04:32] downfall of uzziah and the arm of flesh
[1:04:34] he had depended on and
[1:04:36] had somehow went off the rails and piled
[1:04:38] up in ruin
[1:04:41] and it was a stark lesson for isaiah
[1:04:43] brother branham if you go listen to
[1:04:44] influences
[1:04:46] my nobody can tell the story i remember
[1:04:48] my young hearts
[1:04:49] first or second i don't remember now
[1:04:50] which one i think
[1:04:52] maybe the first sermon i ever preached
[1:04:54] it was either that or from brother
[1:04:56] brown's message identification i can't
[1:04:57] remember
[1:04:58] this was the first or second sermon i
[1:04:59] ever preached on influence
[1:05:01] because my young heart was so stirred
[1:05:03] brother branham was so
[1:05:04] earnest when he's talking about how that
[1:05:07] isaiah
[1:05:08] you know he he sees the lord high
[1:05:12] and lifted up and and you know it
[1:05:15] it it it looked like that you know that
[1:05:19] ah he could be disillusioned about
[1:05:23] uzziah people get disillusioned about
[1:05:26] leaders who fall
[1:05:28] it could be that he was disillusioned
[1:05:31] angry disappointed when he realized that
[1:05:35] israel as a nation was
[1:05:38] a people of unclean lips
[1:05:41] the king was ruined and the people
[1:05:44] weren't what he thought
[1:05:45] but you know it it really goes beyond
[1:05:48] that isaiah 6 showed that it was
[1:05:51] way more than that that seeing the lord
[1:05:55] high and lifting up and lifted up
[1:05:58] somehow it caused isaiah to come to
[1:06:00] terms with his own heart
[1:06:06] facing uh a deep need
[1:06:10] that he didn't even know he had amen
[1:06:13] he'd walked all those years with this
[1:06:15] hollow place and never even knew
[1:06:18] that it was there thought he was fine
[1:06:21] until something in life rocked him
[1:06:24] and now he's in the presence of the lord
[1:06:26] and he's
[1:06:27] he he he's laying on his face this this
[1:06:30] need friends it it went beyond
[1:06:32] his prophet office it went beyond his
[1:06:35] visions
[1:06:36] it it went beyond his service to god it
[1:06:38] wasn't about that it was
[1:06:40] it went beyond his friendships and his
[1:06:42] relationships isaiah was on his face
[1:06:44] saying i'm undone
[1:06:47] i'm i'm i have no value i'm worthless
[1:06:50] i'm completely
[1:06:52] finished the only thing he could say
[1:06:56] about himself i am undone
[1:06:59] i am a man myself of unclean lips
[1:07:03] and further i live among people of
[1:07:06] unclean
[1:07:06] lips
[1:07:11] like never before he knew
[1:07:14] his unworthiness in that presence for
[1:07:17] the first time he could
[1:07:19] feel his sin
[1:07:25] as he laid there before god
[1:07:29] john the revelator had a very similar
[1:07:32] experience in revelation
[1:07:33] 4 when he was called up to see the lord
[1:07:37] high and lifted up
[1:07:39] saw one seated on the throne and there's
[1:07:42] a book that's sealed and somebody needs
[1:07:44] to go get it and they're
[1:07:45] looking nervously around and calling for
[1:07:48] anyone can anybody
[1:07:50] all in all heaven search all of heaven
[1:07:52] leave no stone unturned
[1:07:54] like we can't find anyone look under the
[1:07:56] heaven
[1:07:57] go through the history books search back
[1:07:59] to the beginning
[1:08:00] there's been millions of people born
[1:08:02] surely somebody
[1:08:03] can take that book because if they can't
[1:08:05] we're finished boys
[1:08:06] we're finished we're done tit it's over
[1:08:10] i thought i was going good but i found
[1:08:12] out in his presence that
[1:08:14] i'm not so sure of things anymore and i
[1:08:16] need somebody
[1:08:18] that can that can i see that one on the
[1:08:20] throne but i
[1:08:21] there's no way i can stand and john is
[1:08:24] weeping because he needed somebody
[1:08:26] who could stand in between him and that
[1:08:28] one on the throne
[1:08:30] someone who could be between the two and
[1:08:32] join them back together
[1:08:34] and give john hope again
[1:08:43] isaiah's office as a prophet was molded
[1:08:45] by that early experience
[1:08:50] paul says in romans 7
[1:08:56] 4 and 5 wherefore my brethren
[1:09:01] you also are become dead to the law by
[1:09:04] the spirit of christ that ye should be
[1:09:06] married to another
[1:09:09] even to him who is raised from the dead
[1:09:11] here it is
[1:09:13] that we should bring forth fruit unto
[1:09:16] god
[1:09:18] listen friends
[1:09:22] it's pretty important that you bring
[1:09:23] forth fruit unto god somebody got killed
[1:09:25] for it
[1:09:26] amen you understand
[1:09:30] your old husband got slaughtered and
[1:09:32] there's only one way that could
[1:09:34] happen and that's the lamb of god got
[1:09:36] slaughtered
[1:09:38] and because of that death at the cross
[1:09:41] now a way is made that you don't have to
[1:09:44] be in bondage
[1:09:46] to that old sin anymore
[1:09:49] that you can now bring forth
[1:09:52] fruit unto god so i want to tell you
[1:09:54] something about your christianity
[1:09:56] it's it's not just so you can be well
[1:10:00] thought of or you can have happy
[1:10:01] feelings
[1:10:02] or warm fuzzy thoughts or are or are you
[1:10:06] know
[1:10:06] uh even stimulation by revelation
[1:10:10] wonderful good but i'm here to tell you
[1:10:12] coming to this church being a believer
[1:10:14] being christian having me as your pastor
[1:10:16] it has no value if you're not bringing
[1:10:18] forth what god has put you here to bring
[1:10:20] forth
[1:10:21] that's the only thing that counts it's
[1:10:23] the only thing that matters
[1:10:26] everything else is is layers and layers
[1:10:29] of god's blessing but i'm here to tell
[1:10:30] you something friends
[1:10:31] all the blessing in the world and all
[1:10:32] the fortune and the world won't do you a
[1:10:34] bit of good
[1:10:37] god is looking for you to bring
[1:10:40] forth fruit unto god he planted
[1:10:44] the seeds in you they're already
[1:10:47] in you
[1:10:50] for when we were in the flesh verse 5
[1:10:54] the motions of sin which were by the law
[1:10:58] did work in our members
[1:10:59] to do what to bring forth fruit
[1:11:03] unto death now
[1:11:08] it's amazing that you didn't struggle
[1:11:13] to or not to bring forth fruit unto
[1:11:17] death
[1:11:18] every day you got out of the bed it was
[1:11:20] a natural occurrence
[1:11:22] you were born in sin you agreed with sin
[1:11:26] you lo enjoyed life to you a sinful life
[1:11:29] was normal
[1:11:30] until one day an eagle flew over
[1:11:34] until one day you heard a different
[1:11:36] voice until one day you
[1:11:38] something happened in your life and you
[1:11:39] stopped to think maybe
[1:11:41] this isn't the real me maybe this life
[1:11:44] isn't the life maybe there's a
[1:11:46] maybe there's another life i should be
[1:11:48] living
[1:11:49] oh my brothers and sisters tonight you
[1:11:53] understand how
[1:11:54] supernatural the calling of god on your
[1:11:57] life
[1:11:57] is it has nothing to do with with you
[1:11:59] trying to be a better person or
[1:12:01] you got lucky or you made a decision or
[1:12:03] you came to a church not about that
[1:12:05] you had no chance no hope you were done
[1:12:07] you were finished
[1:12:08] you were flat on your face you were
[1:12:10] undone you were of unclean lips
[1:12:12] had no chance to please god but god rich
[1:12:14] in mercy
[1:12:16] god sent an angel with a pillar of fire
[1:12:18] god touched your lips you fed upon
[1:12:21] the bleeding word of god and what has it
[1:12:23] done it has stood you back on your feet
[1:12:25] again
[1:12:27] now you're a champion for the lord now
[1:12:29] you're ready to go forward and do what
[1:12:31] your own will no his now your whole life
[1:12:35] is about his will
[1:12:37] when you're born again of the spirit of
[1:12:41] god
[1:12:49] the first time that we find it in the
[1:12:52] new testament
[1:12:54] is in matthew chapter 1. let's go there
[1:12:56] brother josh matthew chapter 1
[1:12:58] 19 through 25 matthew chapter 1 verse 19
[1:13:03] 25
[1:13:07] then joseph her husband watch now
[1:13:12] being a just man
[1:13:15] not willing to make her a public example
[1:13:19] was minded to put her away privately but
[1:13:22] while he thought on these things
[1:13:24] behold the angel of the lord appeared
[1:13:26] unto him in a dream saying joseph thou
[1:13:28] son of david
[1:13:29] fear not to take unto thee mary thy wife
[1:13:33] for that which is conceived in her is of
[1:13:36] the holy ghost
[1:13:37] and she shall bring forth
[1:13:41] a son and thou shalt call his name
[1:13:44] jesus for he shall save his people from
[1:13:47] their sins
[1:13:49] now all this was done that it might be
[1:13:51] fulfilled which was spoken of the lord
[1:13:54] by the prophet saying
[1:13:56] behold a virgin shall be with child and
[1:14:00] shall bring forth
[1:14:01] a son and they shall call his name
[1:14:05] emmanuel which being interpreted is
[1:14:08] god with us then joseph being raised
[1:14:12] from sleep
[1:14:12] did as the angel of the lord had bitten
[1:14:14] him and took unto him
[1:14:16] his wife and knew her not
[1:14:19] till she had brought forth her firstborn
[1:14:21] son and he called
[1:14:23] his name jesus
[1:14:26] you know mary had a part we talked a lot
[1:14:29] about
[1:14:30] mary having a part to play in that
[1:14:33] mary couldn't make it happen it was
[1:14:36] quite humanly impossible but what she
[1:14:40] could do
[1:14:41] was agree with the word basically an
[1:14:44] angel
[1:14:44] shows up and says listen
[1:14:47] you're highly favored you've been put in
[1:14:51] the earth
[1:14:51] for such a time as this you're here for
[1:14:55] an exact reason
[1:14:56] and here's the plan mary says
[1:15:01] that's impossible i've never known a man
[1:15:03] and the angel says
[1:15:04] it's okay god's god thought of that
[1:15:09] already been accounted for don't worry
[1:15:13] the holy ghost will overshadow you and
[1:15:16] that which will be born in you
[1:15:17] will be the son of the most high
[1:15:21] he didn't he didn't go down a lawn a
[1:15:23] laundry list
[1:15:24] and say now here's what'll happen to
[1:15:27] your family and
[1:15:28] joseph's gonna have a problem and your
[1:15:29] neighbors and all this is gonna and
[1:15:31] you're gonna get pregnant and you're
[1:15:32] gonna
[1:15:32] you're gonna bring forth in in agony and
[1:15:35] blah blah blah
[1:15:37] and you know he didn't he didn't warn
[1:15:39] her all that he just said
[1:15:40] you know why he didn't because it
[1:15:43] doesn't matter
[1:15:45] it doesn't matter what you go through
[1:15:48] to bring this forth don't let it matter
[1:15:52] just say lord it doesn't matter does it
[1:15:54] matter i don't need to know i don't it
[1:15:56] doesn't matter
[1:15:57] i don't have to know if i'm suffering
[1:15:59] i'll suffer i don't have to know what's
[1:16:01] going to happen to me i don't have to
[1:16:02] know who's going to do what to me
[1:16:04] all i know is you chose me you gave me a
[1:16:06] word i say amen i believe it
[1:16:08] let's get on with it hallelujah that's
[1:16:11] the sign of real believer that's
[1:16:13] somebody who's ready to bring forth
[1:16:16] at any cost at any
[1:16:20] cost no holds barred at any cost
[1:16:24] amen she said that was her part
[1:16:27] that's all she could do i'm here to tell
[1:16:30] you stop trying to serve god and serve
[1:16:33] him
[1:16:34] stop working at it just let just say
[1:16:36] amen to every word
[1:16:38] let god come in and do his work in your
[1:16:41] life to bring forth his word
[1:16:45] and so we find but now mary's not the
[1:16:48] only one joseph's got a part in this
[1:16:52] joseph also has a part he can't do
[1:16:54] mary's part neither can she do his part
[1:16:56] i can't do yours you can't do mine you
[1:16:59] can't do anyone
[1:17:00] you gotta do your own part
[1:17:04] and and joseph had a part in mary's
[1:17:07] bringing forth
[1:17:09] for mary to bring forth joseph needs to
[1:17:11] bring forth the holy ghost needs to
[1:17:12] bring forth
[1:17:13] mary has to say amen all of these things
[1:17:16] have to happen
[1:17:18] he he he had to he had to bring forth
[1:17:21] his fruit of a supporting role
[1:17:26] because the angels instructions to him
[1:17:28] are clear now here's what i need you to
[1:17:29] do
[1:17:30] don't be afraid first
[1:17:34] if you don't get that you'll miss
[1:17:36] everything else you won't accomplish
[1:17:38] if you miss this one first thing is
[1:17:41] fear not to do what i'm about to tell
[1:17:44] you
[1:17:45] fear not to take her because that which
[1:17:48] is in her
[1:17:49] is by the word of god and we find out
[1:17:52] that
[1:17:53] joseph had to bring forth joseph had to
[1:17:56] be willing
[1:17:57] you you have to be willing you've got a
[1:17:59] part to play i got a part to play
[1:18:01] your spouse has a part to play your
[1:18:03] children hey kids
[1:18:04] mom and dad have a part to play your
[1:18:06] siblings have a part to play where
[1:18:08] how many times you hear brother jason
[1:18:10] say it in 26 years we're all
[1:18:12] in this thing together we're all in this
[1:18:15] thing together friends
[1:18:17] no wonder we need to love one another
[1:18:19] and pray for one another and pull
[1:18:21] together
[1:18:22] hallelujah no wonder we need to be for
[1:18:24] one another and stop
[1:18:25] living to ourselves and live for others
[1:18:27] and if everybody in here will live for
[1:18:28] everybody else we'll have a really good
[1:18:30] life
[1:18:34] see it's not it's not about you and your
[1:18:36] desires it's
[1:18:37] this thing's bigger than you oh
[1:18:41] my let me just let me
[1:18:44] with such a pleading heart say to
[1:18:47] teenagers
[1:18:48] listen to me teenagers listen to me
[1:18:52] this thing's bigger than you
[1:18:55] it ain't all about you've got these
[1:18:57] goals you've got these plans you want
[1:18:59] what you want
[1:18:59] this thing's bigger than you you're
[1:19:02] you're
[1:19:03] you're to say you're lucky to say you're
[1:19:05] fortunate
[1:19:06] is a grotesque understatement you've
[1:19:08] been privileged
[1:19:09] to hear the rapture message
[1:19:12] you've been privileged to believe that
[1:19:14] which is going to translate us into
[1:19:16] glory
[1:19:17] live happily ever after you won't live
[1:19:19] happily ever after
[1:19:22] you'll never get it in following a
[1:19:23] hollywood movie follow this one
[1:19:28] bring forth what god has called you stop
[1:19:34] resisting he had to
[1:19:37] play in in in in verse 20
[1:19:41] look look at verse 20 again
[1:19:45] so look but while he thought on these
[1:19:47] things
[1:19:48] behold the angel of the lord appeared
[1:19:50] unto him in a dream saying joseph
[1:19:52] thou son of david fear not taken to thee
[1:19:54] mary thy wife for that which is
[1:19:55] conceived
[1:19:56] in her is of the holy ghost so in verse
[1:19:59] 20
[1:20:00] he had to do something all right
[1:20:04] now look at verse 25
[1:20:07] and knew her not till she had brought
[1:20:09] forth her firstborn now he's got to not
[1:20:11] do something
[1:20:13] so you understand if as long as he will
[1:20:16] do and
[1:20:16] not do then the consequence
[1:20:20] will be according to god's plan if at
[1:20:22] any time you
[1:20:24] if you if you do differently then his
[1:20:28] word is calling and you f and you
[1:20:31] fail to not do something that you know
[1:20:34] you shouldn't
[1:20:36] and you do it anyway i'm here to tell
[1:20:38] you friends there's going to be
[1:20:39] consequences and god's not some evil
[1:20:42] tyrant you know you disobeyed my
[1:20:46] word that has nothing to do with it
[1:20:49] nature itself
[1:20:50] is is is built on consequential behavior
[1:20:55] put a seed in the ground plant it water
[1:20:58] it care for it it'll grow
[1:21:00] you don't have to beg you don't deplete
[1:21:01] it plead for it too it'll grow
[1:21:03] nature will cause it to grow it works on
[1:21:07] autopilot you're you reap what
[1:21:10] you sow and everything you do
[1:21:15] is a seed everything you
[1:21:18] say is a seed everything you
[1:21:21] think is a seed and they're not all good
[1:21:26] and sometimes when those thoughts occur
[1:21:29] you're supposed now that's a seed
[1:21:31] but you're not supposed to plant that
[1:21:33] one you're supposed to bring that
[1:21:35] thought subject to the holy spirit
[1:21:38] and say let's look and see what the lord
[1:21:40] has to say about that thought
[1:21:42] i remember that's one of the lessons my
[1:21:44] dad taught me as a young man
[1:21:47] growing up and as paul said you know you
[1:21:50] know you young men flee youthful lust
[1:21:52] and
[1:21:53] and and the things that and it's not
[1:21:55] just sexual lust but it's all the lust
[1:21:57] of a young man just
[1:21:58] you know that that wonderlust and sexual
[1:22:01] lust and
[1:22:02] and wealth lust and popularity lost and
[1:22:05] and he says to the young men flee that
[1:22:07] that'll poison you that'll kill you
[1:22:08] that'll destroy you you'll never bring
[1:22:10] forth my life
[1:22:11] following that get rid of it and my dad
[1:22:14] would always say that if you'll just
[1:22:16] take that thought the minute you
[1:22:17] hear that thought spoken in your mind by
[1:22:19] the devil he said if you'd bring it to
[1:22:21] the holy ghost he would
[1:22:22] kill it immediately the holy ghost would
[1:22:25] annihilate it on the spot and it would
[1:22:26] never become a deed
[1:22:30] it becomes a deed because you entertain
[1:22:32] it you keep it going and you give it
[1:22:33] life and you give it wings and you grow
[1:22:35] it and you water it you feed it
[1:22:38] and then you find yourself piled up at
[1:22:40] an altar asking god for forgiveness
[1:22:44] it's a good thing he's a loving father
[1:22:47] it's a good thing that i can i can just
[1:22:49] come time and time again and say just
[1:22:52] once more lord just once more i've never
[1:22:55] ceased being thankful to the lord that
[1:22:58] you know that when
[1:22:59] when when samson brother branham's using
[1:23:02] the example of samson
[1:23:03] when samson asked for mercy his words
[1:23:06] are these
[1:23:07] just this once
[1:23:10] but i'm so glad because i've burned that
[1:23:13] once up so long ago
[1:23:15] i'm so glad when a prophet in this day
[1:23:17] goes back and tells the story he changes
[1:23:19] it and he goes
[1:23:20] it's not just this once a prophet says
[1:23:22] just once more lord
[1:23:24] and so every time i can come back and
[1:23:26] say just once more lord
[1:23:28] and i can come back again just once more
[1:23:30] lord and come back again
[1:23:31] i know it's me but just once more lord
[1:23:34] just once more forgive me once more
[1:23:37] cleanse me once more
[1:23:39] fill me up with your spirit
[1:23:43] and people people don't want that kind
[1:23:46] of a message
[1:23:48] they called that bondage oh my goodness
[1:23:52] there's nothing like the message to give
[1:23:55] you the freedom
[1:23:56] the freedom what is real freedom to be
[1:23:58] able to bring forth
[1:24:00] according to the seed that god has
[1:24:02] placed inside you
[1:24:03] you were born in a sinful body that
[1:24:05] can't does never want to do it and a
[1:24:07] mind that doesn't want to do it
[1:24:09] but god rich in mercy comes down
[1:24:12] and brings that seed to life and now i
[1:24:15] can control the
[1:24:16] body instead of the other way around
[1:24:20] oh i've got a quote i'll read for you in
[1:24:22] just a minute if i don't blow through
[1:24:23] the roof
[1:24:24] brother dale i thought boy is too big
[1:24:27] oh my nice little inside joke between me
[1:24:30] and dr smith
[1:24:32] it's too big what are you going to do
[1:24:34] i'm just going to blow up
[1:24:37] i'll walk out
[1:24:41] oh my
[1:24:47] so in verse 20 he's got something to do
[1:24:49] in verse 25 he's got to refrain from
[1:24:51] something
[1:24:52] the result the consequence
[1:24:56] was a perfect fruit that god brought
[1:24:59] forth
[1:25:02] and by it saved the whole world
[1:25:07] amen by a
[1:25:10] a 16 year old girl
[1:25:14] and a an a and uh someone i think joseph
[1:25:18] was maybe 10 years older
[1:25:19] at the time i believe his history that
[1:25:23] she's got to say amen and walk in it
[1:25:26] and he's got some things to do and say
[1:25:29] amen
[1:25:30] and agree and do and not do and here's
[1:25:33] two people
[1:25:34] two people god just went he didn't need
[1:25:37] the whole world
[1:25:40] he just needed two people a husband and
[1:25:42] a wife
[1:25:43] to save the whole world he just needed a
[1:25:46] man willing
[1:25:47] and a woman willing to say amen to every
[1:25:49] word
[1:25:50] hallelujah friend you you mom and dads
[1:25:52] you think you don't have enough in you
[1:25:54] to save your children
[1:25:55] god used two people to save the whole
[1:25:57] world
[1:25:59] the whole world you you tell me you
[1:26:02] can't
[1:26:03] enact the power of god by being together
[1:26:06] in unity
[1:26:07] and in harmony and both of you saying
[1:26:09] amen to the word
[1:26:10] and living and setting an example and
[1:26:12] let your life
[1:26:13] and your holy ghost and your token
[1:26:16] speak i'm here to tell you you can
[1:26:20] and you must hallelujah
[1:26:25] she had to do and not do he had to do
[1:26:29] and not do she had to bring forth her
[1:26:32] life to god's use
[1:26:34] he had to bring forth his life for god's
[1:26:37] use
[1:26:38] it would be the salvation of all israel
[1:26:41] she became willing to pay any price
[1:26:47] even the ultimate sacrifice even of her
[1:26:49] life
[1:26:56] think about your life
[1:27:00] and you say peter said
[1:27:04] i'm willing to die
[1:27:08] that's a that's a an odd way to say it
[1:27:12] and jesus just kind of dealt with it in
[1:27:15] the way he did i don't want to go in
[1:27:16] that direction but
[1:27:18] i want to bring this to you
[1:27:21] you can't don't get to
[1:27:24] and can't start your life
[1:27:28] and you didn't get to choose it you
[1:27:31] don't get to choose when it's over
[1:27:34] so i could take my own life if god
[1:27:36] allows
[1:27:40] brother adam tried it twice
[1:27:43] failed both times you know why he failed
[1:27:46] to take his own life
[1:27:47] because he had a message to preach and
[1:27:48] god wasn't going to allow it
[1:27:53] he tries to put his hand on 23 000 votes
[1:27:56] brother ram said there wouldn't have
[1:27:57] even been blood left in me
[1:27:59] and he said i was re i pulled my glove
[1:28:02] off
[1:28:03] and i reached toward and he said and i
[1:28:05] was saying sherry honey
[1:28:07] i'm sorry i'm a coward lord i'm a coward
[1:28:10] sherry daddy will see you just in a
[1:28:12] moment
[1:28:13] and he said when i came to i was sitting
[1:28:15] on the ground crying
[1:28:18] how'd he get out of the pole who knows
[1:28:21] how did he
[1:28:22] how is he not dead only god
[1:28:26] putting a revolver here's a man
[1:28:27] experience with firearms putting a
[1:28:29] loaded gun to his head
[1:28:30] and squeezing i squeeze the trigger
[1:28:34] and it wouldn't go off until he threw it
[1:28:37] and then it went off when it wasn't
[1:28:39] aimed at him
[1:28:42] oh let me tell you something friends you
[1:28:44] think you're in control of your life you
[1:28:45] didn't bring it here
[1:28:47] you don't get to end it you know the
[1:28:50] you know what you get to do everything
[1:28:53] in the middle
[1:28:58] you can't choose when it come you can't
[1:29:00] shoot god chose that
[1:29:02] god will chew god chooses when you come
