TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] do [Music] [Music] so [Music] good morning everyone god bless you let's stand and pray heavenly father we love you we're so thankful for your mercy and grace lord we know we know the wickedness of our own sin lord even even today even even at the same time you tell us that we're washed in the blood of christ and that we're cleansed that we never even did it in the first place lord we yet we know we know in our hearts that we often make mistakes and we fail and yet lord you pick us up you you draw us further and closer lord you give us a heart to repent i believe that's the zeal of this seventh church age be zealous therefore and repent and so lord i think it was luther that said the christian life is a life of repentance and so lord we just want our hearts to be right with you we want our minds to be right with you and we just want to experience the the cleansing of the washing of water of the word lord just cleanse our hearts and minds and make us more in the image of jesus christ that's why we're still here that's why the rapture has it takes taken place you're making us more like him so we just commit ourselves to you we ask that the holy spirit would come take this word and break it open to our hearts lord anoint the speaker anoint the here and you be glorified in jesus name amen i'm going to continue on the subject of christian character this will be part 8 and we're continuing to look at love we're going to continue on that from that subject i'm going to do a quick review to start it off and then we'll go further than we did last time the opening scriptures romans 12 9 and 10. let agape love be without dissimulation abhor that which is evil cleave to that which is good be kindly affectioned this word kindly affection is phyllostorgos it's a combination of brotherly love filo or friendship love and store ghost which is family love one to another with brotherly love so philadelphia in honor preferring one another may the lord have the blessing to the reading of his word he can be seated so we mentioned it before but agape love from the strong's concordance says agape is wider embracing especially the judgment and the deliberate ascent of the will as a matter of principle duty and propriety filio love uh from strong's concordance says to be a friend to fond of an individual or an object have an affection denoting personal attachment as a matter of sentiment or feeling embracing especially the judgment and the deliberate ascent of the will as a matter of principle duty and propriety so it's similar to agape but it's a little different in that filio love is looking at it from the aspect of friendship agape love is looking at it as this is how we treat everyone whether if there's a connection through the body of christ or through family or whatever it might be whether there's no connection in fact there's enmity from one party towards you agape love still needs to rule first thessalonians 4 9 and 10 but as touching brotherly love that's philadelphia you need not that i write unto you for ye yourselves are taught of god to agape one another and indeed you do it toward all the brethren which are in all macedonia but we beseech you brethren that you increase more and more so you see again philadelphia filio love and agape love are closely connected together i i would put it like this agape love actually completes filial love you can have one without the other and uh and you can have agape love for someone without having that friendship or affection between each other and if they hate you you agape them but if they're your buddy like brother luther brother you have filio love and agape love both together you need to have it so those things are kind of the foundational aspect proverbs 17 verse 17. and again we're kind of looking more so at filio love at what i would say at biblical friendship proverbs 17 verse 17 says this a friend that loves at all times and a brother is born for adversity let's think about this verse for a second a friend stands with you in good times and bad times but a brother he doesn't always stand with you in in good times but when there's adversity your brother will stand up and step up and stand with you so again this is talking about friendship versus a family relationship and and of course proverbs is this is an absolute you know you have you could have a brother that stands with you at all times right um it's this is principles you know you'll have that's why you'll have in the book of proverbs one verse it says one thing the next verse it says the exact opposite both are true it just depends on the circumstances in the situation that you're you find yourself in a friend loves you in an adversity a true friend he could be your brother too a true friend loves you when there's adversity and he loves you when the times are good he doesn't just love you when the times are good job had some friends like that didn't he and then then accuse him and fight against him when the times are bad which is the next verse we have job 19 verse 14. brother branham talks about this he says sometimes the lord will allow everyone to turn against you because he wants to see how you respond how how you react he wants to see where your faith and confidence is fully put job had that happened to him my kin folks have failed his family's failed him my familiar friends have forgotten me so there's times where you really find out who your friends are you really find out who stands with you and it hurts it's painful when you find out your friends ain't your friends but that's okay that's okay as christians we say okay we forgive you and we move along because we have a friend that will never fail us will never leave us never forsake us our lord jesus christ brother branham says this in october 1958 lifting him up out of history it seems like that that real family love don't exist much more just something has happened home life is running out we don't have the old american home as we used to have it long years ago there's another thing i would like to say that is another thing running out is friendship is running out it don't seem like that we have the friends as we used to have and the friends that we have are not loyal friends like used to be it used to be i can remember when someone got sick in the neighborhood that everybody come around and they helped them with all their work and lended a hand to anything could be done set up with them all night at a time as i've often said it's the truth that we hardly know the neighbor is dead until we see it in the paper friendship so i i don't want to take that it's just as brother branham complaining about what we have i want to take it as this is what friendship means this is what being neighborly means what does it mean he says here loyalty loyalty to your friend standing with your friend you'll you'll have times where people will come and make accusations against your friend or stand against your friend right or wrong will you stand with them okay if they're wrong you can talk to them but if another person is coming and attacking your friend be loyal god loves that god delights in a loyal friend that won't throw their other friend under the bus but today we don't have anything like the love of many wax grows wax cold it's terrible so it used to be when someone got sick in the neighborhood that everybody come around and help them with all our work so a real friend someone's sick you go and help them with their work and he says that they used to stay stay up lend a hand and stay up and sit with them all night if it was necessary so that a spouse or a daughter or son could go and get some rest this he's talking about what real friendship is hardly we hardly know the neighbor is dead until we see it in the paper again don't take it as just a complaint and say oh it's just a fact he's he's telling this is what you as christians should be doing you should know your neighbors i'm convicted i'm guilty you should know your neighbors you should know what's going on in their life so that you can do what he says here be a help to them make a meal for them sit and talk with them just be friendly we don't we don't do that anymore it's not our cult it's not our american culture anymore but i believe brother branham's telling us it's god's culture this is god's purpose this is god's plan love your neighbor as yourself who's your neighbor everybody everyone on the planet proverbs 27 verse 10 thine own friend and thy father's friend forsake not think about that don't forsake your friends what does it mean to forsake your friends it means to a desert or abandon them how easily we do it how easily we do it in today's day and age we just move on we we move on from the friendship we move on from the relationship not a word nothing don't it don't hardly matter to us it's completely unscriptural it says don't forsake your friend you say but they're doing this but they're it doesn't say any qualification it says don't forsake them it's not telling you if they do this do that stick with them not only your friend but your father's some of the best friends you could possibly have are your dad's friends why if you have a godly dad then he's got godly friends and that means that they can be an example of manhood they can be an example they can give you advice they can direct you and help you in your life they can be a help in many situations often my dad's friends would stand up and almost do anything for me because they love my dad how important is don't forsake him don't take that lightly don't take these relationships as meaningless or unimportant god sees them differently and the word of god treats them differently than we do in our society too much we're impacted by american culture it's not good it's not good at all neither go into your brother's thy brother's house in the day of calamity interesting for better is a neighbor that is nearer than a brother that's far off what does it mean it's talking about someone who is a true friend who stands with you you might have a brother and you're not close there's not a good relationship or there's a bad rivalry or a bad situation well of course as a christian you should try to heal that you should try to fix that keep it in a good positive place but if you can't fix it just understand go to your go to your neighbor go to your real friend's house in the day of trouble they will stand with you a true christian brother will stand with you and that goes to the reverse is we need to stand with each other in difficult times in trials you know we don't have to give all of our money like it's a commune and then support it but we should not consider that our money is our own somebody has a need and is in desperation we should just say here knowing that god don't say well if i give that then i won't be able to do this god knows he knows all that he can meet your need he says give and it will be given to you you know we're that's what he wants us to do is to be there for each other in the days of calamity james 1 19 and i'm going to read it from the english standard version for this one says know this my beloved brothers let every person be quick to hear slow to speak and slow to anger i think this is so critical in our day and age our social media and just in general life teaches us not really to listen we don't really listen we just wait for our opportunity to shout over the top of somebody else or just to give our opinion be quick be quick to give your opinion no it says be quick to hear i think the saying has been said over and over again you have two ears and one mouth use them accordingly but a real friend takes the time to close their mouth and listen and even more than that a real friend if the friend is just doesn't want to talk and is all clammed up the friend is going to not rest until their friend shares their heart and talks through what they're going through and a real friend he's going to be not not just i'm just going to listen and then dispute no he's going to ask questions he's going to talk he's going to clarify he's going to help he's going to ask questions to help the friend realize what's really going on what's at the bottom of this problem you don't have to say anything you just have to have wisdom to ask questions many times and god the person solves their own problem through the bible and through asking biblical questions that's all that's necessary we want to make sure we understand our friends correctly really are deeply understanding them before we open our mouth and talk it's critical it's key be quick to hear and slow to give your opinion on real life and social media there was a there was a little meme i sent out onto the um the booth group that i i really kind of live by is when it was a picture of a little frog and then i think a chameleon the little frog was just sitting there and the chameleon had its like hits its hand over the top of its mouth and it said uh me trying to respond to a political post on social media and he says this is me the frog and then the the chameleon or the little lizard was the holy spirit with his hand over and saying shut your mouth stop in your mouth i think that's good we don't always have to respond to everything it's not up to us and sometimes sometimes you display christ the best with your mouth shut and if someone frustrates you don't speak the frustration speak the love that you have even if you don't feel it if you feel frustrated if you feel upset speak the love because the feelings will then follow we're not supposed to follow our feelings we're supposed to follow the truth and the truth is that i love my enemies i don't always feel that but i we it says be slow to anger so be slow to anger be quick to listen and be quick to express love to others let's see where am i at here job 6 14. i'm going to read from the esv again he who withholds kindness from a friend forsakes the fear of the almighty wow amen he that withholds kindness that's quite an astounding statement in other words giving kindness to others is an expression that you have reverence for god your reverence for god is expressed by doing something loving for another person believer or unbeliever co-worker anyone that's expressing fear the fear of god in your life and if on the the reverse is that if you ignore if you see someone has a need and you don't do anything about it you ignore it you don't fear god wow ouch proverbs 27 verse 9. again i'm going to read from the esv oil and perfume make the heart glad and the sweetness or pleasantness of a friend comes from his earnest counsel counsel means advice isn't that isn't that beautiful the sweetness of a friend comes from his genuine sincere advice i think i think that's something that we need to remember about friendship we just look at friendship as fun in america but friendship is not equal to fun that's not what it's all about marriage is not equal to fun that's not what it's all about ultimately friendship is influence over one another and young people you have to remember that what kind of life are you building look at your friends look at the people that you're receiving advice from well i don't receive advice from them you are receiving advice from them absolutely even if they're not giving you advice of course they are of course they are you just don't look at that at it that way but you're if they're your friend and they're in your life you're getting their advice do you want their advice if you weren't emotionally attached in some way would you really want their advice or would you run like the wind like a gazelle away from their advice then you should consider why is this person my friend that doesn't mean you have to stop serving them in whatever way but in some way some ways if that person has got into your life so close and you're just constantly receiving their advice and their counsel it's time to break it off and run like a gazelle let's see here proverbs 27 verse 6. faithful are the wounds of a friend but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful amen we don't ever we usually don't want to be corrected we usually don't want to have any kind of words quote unquote come against us but that's because we have a wrong viewpoint we have a viewpoint of protecting self what's the point of protecting yourself if yourself is not in line with the word of god you want to come in line with the word and a real genuine friend is going to wound you what does it mean he's going to correct you he's going to speak truth into your life whether you like it or not and actually you'll learn and grow to appreciate it it won't be an offense to you why because there's a real connection between you if a stranger comes up to me or someone who's distant from me or rude to me all the time comes up and corrects me what am i going to do right away who are you to talk to me that's our attitude and it's not good at the same time is understandable so us if you want to correct someone have a build a relationship build a friendship first show love first don't just show up into their life and punch them in the nose and then walk away build a build a friendship build a relationship and through that relationship through that friendship you can speak truth to them that might hurt a little bit and they can do it to you and it might hurt a little bit that's what a real godly friend will do and it'll be a normal thing i had a i had a friend back in minnesota and he and i met on a weekly basis for for coffee didn't always work but it most of the time it did and he and i got to the place in our relationship where we would just openly it was no problem we we had it like well what's going on okay and they'd bring it back to me like oh okay and it was just a normal thing in our relationship why because the love never changed the attitude never changed the approach never changed and we appreciated each other for speaking hard things to each other that other people wouldn't do i believe that's the kind of friendships we need to have with one another but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful kisses of an enemy what is it talking about it's saying people are flattering you it's saying people are buttering you up what does that look like it looks like they're really your friend doesn't it but actually they're just your enemy if all you hear is pat's on the back oh you're such a good guy you're so nice you're so this you said just wait for it the slap is coming but we need godly correction and we need friends like that that we feel loved and secure in the christian friendship that we have that we can speak convicting things to one another and that we rejoice in that philemon 1 10 through 12 and once again i reading from the esv just to get a little bit more of the feel of it i appeal to you for my child onesimus whose father i became in my imprisonment formerly he was useless to you my goodness that's quite a statement formerly he was useless to you but now he is indeed useful to you and to me i am sending him back to you listen to this sending my very heart what a statement what a relationship and friendship that paul had with philemon that they that he could say i'm sending philemon but it's not just philemon i'm sending to you it's my very heart i believe that's the kind of connections that god wants us to have in the body of christ no not that we make one another god instead of god but that we have such a we have a heart to heart connection that we really know each other from the heart and understand each other from the heart so many problems are are solved by really knowing each other in this way being genuine being honest being true not putting up putting up a front or a wall to protect ourselves no god doesn't want that in the body of christ he wants true ministry to happen between all of us not just from the preachers but between all of us but it comes when he unites our hearts in connection together proverbs 17 verse 9. and again i'll read from the esv whoever covers an offense seeks love but he who repeats a matter separates close friends this is critical in a friend and a genuine friendship is when you speak to someone you should know that it's staying between the two of you and it's not going any further than that and if you if you cover an offense what are you what are you doing what is your purpose not to hide it not to sweep it under the rug of course you're talking talking to them about about it and they're you're talking to each other to help them in their growth in christ and you cover it why because you love them you're seeking love but the person that repeats it to someone else you're separating close friends proverbs 16 28 says a dishonest man spreads strife and a whisper separates close friends again this is absolutely critical gossip destroys relationships gossip destroys friendships and we have to absolutely it destroys trust and destroyed trust brings a distance between people and it brings a wall between people and god wants us to seek to restore it not not if you offended should you restore it if you were the one being offended the bible says you are supposed to go to the person and talk to them and if you know you offended someone you're not supposed to rest until you've gone and solved the problem you're not supposed to bring even your tie your tithe or come and take communion until you go and solve the problem why because it breaks the unity and brother branham talks about it you can't you can't have healing you can't have spiritual blessings when these things are going on in the body it brings damage it brings hurt it brings to the place where the spirit of god has just stopped why because we're selfish protecting ourself we don't want to confront we don't want to deal with it you we need to we need to talk to each other that's that's what it is and we need to be quick to listen and slow to speak and slow to get mad about it so let's stand up and pray heavenly father we thank you so much for these things lord i pray that you would help them to be a a reality in our life not just really good doctrine put forth over the sunday school pulpit lord but correct us and teach us and and plant these things in our heart and convict us and help us to really move forward in the love of christ lord we commit the service to you today we ask that your holy spirit would just come and and deal with us throughout it lord in the worship in the prayer and in the preaching of the word and we ask that you would be glorified we commit it to you in the name of jesus christ amen amen god bless you
