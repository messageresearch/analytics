[2:32] [Music]
[2:49] Praise the Lord.
[2:53] Amen. Give the Lord a hand.
[2:57] Amen.
[3:00] Amen. I'm so thankful to be together
[3:03] again with his children. Praise the
[3:05] Lord. This is just a small dose of what
[3:08] we're headed for.
[3:10] Can you imagine how many the tables are
[3:14] thousand miles long? It's a lot of
[3:16] people. So, you better get used to
[3:18] rubbing shoulders with your brothers and
[3:20] sisters.
[3:21] Praise the Lord. Let's pray. If you have
[3:24] a request upon your heart, I want to
[3:26] give a little testimony about my son.
[3:29] He's about 6 months sober.
[3:32] Um,
[3:34] seems to do very good. He has a real
[3:36] good job. He has a
[3:39] he has a woman in his life that is um
[3:43] his age and she's very um Christian
[3:47] oriented. They met in church so it's not
[3:50] he's not chasing around some teenager.
[3:53] But um I just he's just seems very
[3:57] happy, healthy. Just want to keep
[3:59] praying for him. Um we all know what
[4:02] parents want for our children. We want
[4:04] to pull the Holy Ghost and God leading
[4:06] their lives. And if there's a marriage
[4:08] involved or a relationship that it's God
[4:11] bringing it together and working through
[4:13] it
[4:14] as our brother brought the
[4:16] responsibility upon the parents. You
[4:18] know, brother Brandon talked about
[4:20] wasn't juvenile delinquency, it was
[4:23] parent delinquency. Of course, that's
[4:24] what's going on today. This is just a
[4:27] culmination of all the parent
[4:29] delinquency that's been going on for
[4:30] years and years and years. So God, help
[4:33] us to straighten that out in our own
[4:35] families and our own churches. Let's
[4:37] pray. Father, I love you this morning. I
[4:40] want to welcome all the visitors.
[4:42] Father, I pray that you would just touch
[4:44] each and every heart in a special way
[4:45] this morning. Draw them closer to you,
[4:48] dear God. And Father, those that are
[4:51] streaming, those that may not have the
[4:54] opportunity to assemble in a building,
[4:56] but like precious
[4:58] faith and saints, Father, we pray for
[5:00] them this morning. May the streaming if
[5:02] they listen or the archive, Father, may
[5:06] there just be something said. May your
[5:07] spirit be there to bless and strengthen
[5:09] them, Lord, through this troublesome
[5:12] times that we're living. I thank you for
[5:14] your grace and mercy in my own life and
[5:16] for my children. Lord, we just continue
[5:19] to hold up that faith token,
[5:22] your promise that they are ours.
[5:26] Pray that you bless your people. Bless
[5:27] the tithes and offerings as we gather
[5:29] the offering this morning. Lord, we want
[5:33] your word. You have preeminence in our
[5:34] lives. The gifts that stand behind this
[5:36] pulpit. Move the man aside.
[5:39] Help us each one to receive what you
[5:41] have for us. In Jesus name we pray.
[5:43] Amen.

[19:30] Okay, let's give Brother Andrew and
[19:32] Brother Brad a hand. Amen.
[19:37] Thank you. Praise the Lord.
[19:43] If um before I sing, I just wanted to to
[19:48] share a scripture with y'all.
[19:52] Um
[19:54] Luke 7:36
[19:57] uh it talks about
[20:00] the woman coming and Jesus having dirty
[20:02] feet. And uh Luke 7, if you read it
[20:05] tonight, go down to verse 50.
[20:09] And it says, "And he said unto the
[20:11] woman, thy faith has saved thee. Go in
[20:15] peace." Can you imagine what she must
[20:18] have felt like when he actually said
[20:20] that to her? "Thy faith has saved thee.
[20:22] Go in peace."
[20:24] Um,
[20:26] back in 1964,
[20:29] you know, there was a a preacher, a
[20:32] prophet, a man of God by the name of
[20:35] William Marian Brandham, which, you
[20:37] know, some of y'all visiting may not
[20:39] know, and some of y'all online may not
[20:41] know, but he preached a a sermon about
[20:44] Jesus keeps his appointments. It was
[20:46] preached April 18th in the evening,
[20:49] 1964.
[20:50] And I'm just going to read just a couple
[20:52] things real quick before Andrew and I
[20:54] sing this song. And this is he does a
[20:57] drama, a drama about this woman, what
[21:01] she must have been and what she once
[21:03] went through. And it starts in paragraph
[21:06] 126. It says she was hungry. She smelt
[21:10] that. She said, "My, it smells good. I
[21:13] wonder really a piece of that roasted
[21:15] lamb would really taste in the human's
[21:17] mouth." Now, she couldn't get too close
[21:20] to him because she was a foul woman.
[21:24] They were self-righteous people. They
[21:27] belonged to church, so they couldn't get
[21:29] around where she was at. She was
[21:31] considered a sinner. So, she walked up
[21:33] close and she got to look around. She's
[21:35] seen all them standing there and the
[21:37] water running out of their mouth. And as
[21:40] they gasped, you know, and looking at
[21:43] this lamb and they're roasting, all the
[21:47] fine foods and things being packed
[21:49] around in there. She began to look
[21:52] through the crowd like that and her eyes
[21:54] fell upon, "Who is that? He's got dirty
[21:57] feet. I wonder who that where where
[22:00] somebody would tell me say, will you?"
[22:02] She turns away real quick. I want
[22:05] nothing to do with her. She's a sinner.
[22:07] So ask somebody else. Finally, maybe a
[22:09] little lady that was believing and
[22:11] looking the same way said, "Madam, would
[22:13] you pardon me?" But would you who is
[22:16] that sitting there? How did that person
[22:20] So you can imagine the rest of the
[22:22] drama. Here's this this woman and and
[22:25] she was a reprobate woman and she knew
[22:28] Jesus was invited to this place and and
[22:32] he was invited as a mocking. He had
[22:35] dirty feet. He had dust and dirt all
[22:38] over his beard.
[22:40] Man, when I heard him preach that
[22:42] sermon, something just touched my heart.
[22:45] And I asked Andrew if he would please
[22:48] learn this song and
[22:51] he'd sing it with me. I pray it means as
[22:54] much to you as it did to me.
[23:00] [Music]
[23:14] A woman came to Simon's house.
[23:18] She knew the Lord was there.
[23:23] And as she walked into that room, she
[23:27] was greeted by a stare.
[23:32] She surely must have shocked a few of
[23:36] the people gathered there.
[23:40] As with tearfilled eyes and trembling
[23:43] hands, she took down her long dark hair.
[23:48] And from an alabaster
[23:51] vessel,
[23:53] precious ointment filled the air.
[23:58] [Music]
[23:59] And as she wept, she kissed his feet and
[24:03] began anointing them.
[24:06] [Music]
[24:11] And with her hands
[24:13] [Music]
[24:15] she was touching
[24:18] him.
[24:20] The alpha, the omega,
[24:24] the beginning and the end. And with her
[24:29] hands
[24:33] she was holding on to his.
[24:38] The source of life was right there in
[24:42] her hands.
[24:43] [Music]
[24:46] Now Simon said within his heart, "Lord,
[24:52] if you only knew
[24:56] the kind of woman
[25:01] that's touching you,
[25:04] but Jesus knew about her past.
[25:08] He knew about the sin.
[25:12] Yet he saw in her a repentant heart that
[25:17] had come to worship him.
[25:24] And with her hands
[25:29] she was touching
[25:31] him.
[25:35] And with her heart
[25:37] she was loving
[25:40] him. With her hands
[25:46] she was holding on to him
[25:50] when the source of life was right there
[25:54] in her hand.
[26:00] Tell me why do we gather
[26:03] together in his name?
[26:07] Or are we like the ones who merely
[26:10] watch? Tell me, is that why we came?
[26:16] Or are we like this sister?
[26:20] Do we truly enter in
[26:24] in spirit and in truth?
[26:28] Have you come to worship him?
[26:38] Thank you, Lord.
[26:40] [Music]
[26:45] Heat. Heat.
[26:48] [Music]
[27:24] Now tell me, why do we gather
[27:29] together in his name.
[27:31] [Music]
[27:32] Are we like the ones who merely watched?
[27:37] Tell me, is that why we came?
[27:42] Or are we like this sister?
[27:45] Do we truly enter in
[27:50] spirit and in truth?
[27:54] Have you come to worship him?
[28:01] And with your hands
[28:06] are you touching
[28:09] him?
[28:12] And with your heart
[28:15] are you loving
[28:18] him?
[28:19] And with your hands
[28:24] are you holding on to heal.
[28:29] When the source of life is right there
[28:33] in your hand.
[28:36] [Music]
[28:38] When the source of life is right there
[28:43] in your hand.
[28:50] [Music]
[29:01] Amen. I got requests to sing this song.
[29:04] We're going to sing it as brother Jason
[29:06] comes. Let's stand.

[29:13] the word this morning? Amen.
[29:17] Y'all sing it with me.

[29:28] grace.

[29:34] filled me with peace.

[29:44] of need.

[34:28] story. You got the actual proof of it.
[34:30] Amen. Praise the Lord. Brother Jack sent

[34:35] just now finding that out. Sister Kathy.
[34:39] He's sneaky, sister. Amen. He likes to
[34:42] give God the glory. So, Sister Kathy,
[34:45] was that a large mouth or a small Eye?
[34:48] Really? Wow. It was a nice catch, man.
[34:50] It would be the envy of Brother Dale if
[34:53] uh if he uh might send it to him, say,
[34:55] "Hey, come on up here, Brother Jack."
[34:57] And take you to where they are.
[34:59] Amen. Praise the Lord. So, we were
[35:01] really happy to see her. Amen. Her and
[35:04] Brother Jack out yesterday. Was that
[35:05] yesterday, Brother Jack? Praise the
[35:07] Lord. So, he made you fishers of men and
[35:10] fishers of fish.
[35:13] Oh, wow. Wow. Yeah, that was a that was
[35:16] a big old lake.
[35:19] Well, God bless you. Uh we're happy to
[35:21] have visitors with us today. Amen. Amen.
[35:24] See you brother uh JD and sister uh
[35:27] Amy's family with us here. Friends also
[35:30] in the back. Lucas, my goodness. Here
[35:32] you are. Where's Molly? Wave at me.
[35:34] Molly, jump. Oh, she's in. Oh, okay. All
[35:37] right. Praise the Lord. Happy to have
[35:39] them here today. Visitors there in the
[35:41] back. Other visitors. I'm quite sure I'm
[35:43] overlooking you. Forgive me for that.
[35:45] Amen. Don't be looking at me like I'm
[35:47] gonna call you a visitor.
[35:49] [Laughter]
[35:51] I probably should, but we're not going
[35:53] to do that.
[35:55] Amen. So, we're happy uh to be here
[35:58] today, and we want to look right to uh
[36:01] uh the the Gospel of John. And uh once
[36:05] again, uh I have not been faithful to
[36:09] let my team know where we're going.
[36:11] Amen. Praise the Lord. But it's all
[36:13] good. Amen. Amen. team. Praise the Lord.
[36:18] No, all I got to do is figure out where
[36:19] I'm going.
[36:22] So, um, today I boy, I tell you, it's
[36:27] just been something on my mind to try to
[36:30] figure out, uh, exactly how we wanted to
[36:33] start and um what all we want to cover.
[36:37] And there's always more than you can
[36:39] cover. Always, always, never fails.
[36:41] There's always more than we can cover.
[36:44] And so, um, we just want the perfect
[36:47] mind of the Lord. Amen. I appreciate
[36:50] everybody's cooperation. Amen. On the
[36:52] parking situation, we don't normally
[36:54] have a rainy, stormy Sunday like this,
[36:57] so we wanted to be able to leave room
[36:59] there. And that was mainly for just
[37:01] today.
[37:02] Oh my goodness. Here he goes. All right,
[37:05] son. All right. Praise the Lord. Got to
[37:08] keep that boy off of me. Amen. Praise
[37:11] the Lord. But we don't complain because
[37:14] he uh does such a good job with our
[37:16] sound and mixing and everything. So, uh
[37:19] we're going to try to follow the leader
[37:21] in that. Amen. I appreciate you all with
[37:24] that parking. So, we we just were trying
[37:26] to keep that that was really just a rule
[37:28] for today. Uh or anytime we have stormy
[37:31] weather like that on a Sunday or
[37:32] Wednesday, you want to leave room
[37:34] because we don't have a carport you can
[37:35] pull up under. And so, we have to get
[37:38] people sometimes. Fortunately, when we
[37:40] got here, it wasn't really going all
[37:42] that hard. Amen. Sister Mom, Brother
[37:45] Mark, got your wiper blades on right
[37:46] before the deluge. Amen. So, I told him,
[37:49] "Brother Mark, you saved me again." I'd
[37:51] rather have brother Mark out there doing
[37:53] it than all thumbs yours truly trying to
[37:56] trying to do it. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[37:58] I got people.
[38:00] Amen. That's how I roll. I got people.
[38:03] Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. All right.
[38:07] Well, God bless you. Let's look at at
[38:09] first John I'm sorry St. John chapter 1.
[38:11] Let me get there myself.
[38:15] Um you know it's interesting because
[38:18] when we look at this particular um
[38:22] scripture in John uh and I want to get
[38:25] my place situated here in my notes where
[38:28] I need to be. That's definitely not
[38:29] where I need to be. Um Whoops.
[38:34] before I jump in and try to get started.
[38:36] Oh, that's why. Okay. Now we have the
[38:39] the seal is broken. All right.
[38:48] All right.
[38:50] That's not going to work if you're
[38:51] trying to do the same exact thing.
[38:56] Oh, perfectly. Okay. All right. So, in
[38:59] St. John,
[39:02] I want to begin at the 14th verse.
[39:07] Oh, I'm going to First John, but I I
[39:10] don't need to try to start there. Okay,
[39:12] here we go. Let me let me get right
[39:14] here. All right. John chapter 1.
[39:18] And we know that John had opened up with
[39:22] the word being God was with God. The
[39:25] world was made by him. He denies that he
[39:29] was the Christ or that you know he he
[39:31] clearly identifies himself down through
[39:33] those first um 13 verses. And he comes
[39:38] to verse 14. And the word was made flesh
[39:43] and dwelt among us. And we beheld his
[39:46] glory, the glory as of the only begotten
[39:50] of the father, full of grace and truth.
[39:55] John bare witness of him and cried,
[39:58] saying, "This was he of whom I spake. He
[40:01] that cometh after me is preferred before
[40:04] me, for he was before me." And uh now
[40:08] you you're going to want to just
[40:10] immediately realize what's being said
[40:12] here because John is older than Jesus,
[40:17] right? But yet he's saying in the
[40:20] beginning was the word and that word was
[40:21] made flesh and that and he that one that
[40:24] is made flesh is older than me was
[40:26] before me. See even though in human
[40:29] terms John it seems almost backwards.
[40:32] All right. John bare witness of him and
[40:34] cried saying this was he of whom I
[40:36] spake. He that cometh after me is
[40:38] preferred before me for he was before me
[40:41] and of his fullness have all we received
[40:44] and grace for grace. He goes on for the
[40:47] law was given by Moses but grace and
[40:50] truth came by Jesus Christ. Now this
[40:53] next verse is paramount.
[40:57] No man hath seen God at any time. The
[41:01] you remember the Bible talks about how
[41:03] that he dwells in unapproachable
[41:05] darkness.
[41:06] He dwells in a thick in the cloudy
[41:08] pillar. Do you remember that?
[41:10] In in thick darkness and multitudes in a
[41:12] cloudy pillar. No man hath seen God at
[41:15] any time.
[41:17] The only begotten son which is in the
[41:20] bosom of the father. He hath declared
[41:24] him. In other words, he hath manifested
[41:27] him. You couldn't see God as a spirit.
[41:30] So if you were going to see God, he had
[41:33] to become a manifestation so that you
[41:35] could see something you could see.
[41:37] Now in the dawn of the ages, he became
[41:39] that pillar of fire that led the
[41:41] children of Israel. It was the angel of
[41:43] the covenant. It met Paul on the road to
[41:45] Damascus. So whether it was uh you know
[41:48] predating Genesis uh the create the
[41:52] creation order of Genesis or whether it
[41:55] it appeared over with Moses and appeared
[41:58] in the tabernacle in the wilderness or
[42:01] whether it was in Jesus Christ or
[42:03] whether it met Paul on the road to
[42:04] Damascus. It was all the same person.
[42:06] Yeah. Amen.
[42:07] In a form that could be seen. So that
[42:11] that's why God it was that same God not
[42:13] a second or a third person but that same
[42:17] God condensing or condescending himself
[42:20] into a form that could be seen. It's why
[42:23] brother Brandon would say I can see way
[42:25] back before stars before God was even
[42:28] worshiped as God. And he said he began
[42:30] to form that little pillar of fire
[42:32] something that could be seen. Of course
[42:35] when he first did that there was
[42:36] actually still yet nothing to see him.
[42:39] So then he's going to create angels.
[42:40] Then they start worshiping him and now
[42:42] he's a worshiped being.
[42:45] Right?
[42:46] All right. So this is a very very very
[42:48] important part that God always takes a
[42:52] form for observation. All right. All
[42:55] right. So uh let's pray.
[42:59] Father we thank you for your word now
[43:01] this morning. and I commit my heart and
[43:04] my mind to you right now, Lord, and ask
[43:07] for you just to take over and bring your
[43:10] word forth as you see fit. Lord, we
[43:13] thank you for the people gathered out.
[43:15] We pray for those who are still
[43:17] traveling in, Lord, coming through bad
[43:19] weather. We're asking for your mercy,
[43:21] those who are out of town and and are
[43:24] out of town and then those who have been
[43:26] and who are returning on the road even
[43:28] right now, Lord. And we're asking for
[43:30] your mercy for them in Jesus name.
[43:33] Amen. God bless you. You can be seated.
[43:38] You know, um while you're seated, I want
[43:41] to give you a prayer request that came
[43:44] in from Sister Patricia Short. Um her
[43:48] mother, uh 81 years old, has had a
[43:51] stroke according to the doctors and
[43:54] they've uh taken her, I think, to a
[43:56] different place for treating her. But,
[43:59] uh, Sister Pat and Brother John, they
[44:01] called me this morning on the way
[44:02] driving in and asked us if we as an
[44:05] assembly would pray for that situation.
[44:08] And Sister Pat was making no bones about
[44:11] it. She wanted to see a miracle. I like
[44:13] that kind of courage. I believe we
[44:15] should ask God for big things. Amen.
[44:18] While I have you all here, let's just
[44:19] pray once more. Master, we're thinking
[44:22] now of our dear sister, Lord, who I know
[44:24] and spoken to her before, Lord, under
[44:27] the attack of the enemy now, Father.
[44:30] She's well stricken in years, and we
[44:31] understand these things, these old dying
[44:33] bodies, this pest house we live in. But
[44:36] Lord, that doesn't mean we have to leave
[44:38] the earth with broken health. We can
[44:40] leave perfectly healthy just at your
[44:42] time. So Lord, we are commanded to pray
[44:45] for the sick and we do so. We ask for
[44:47] your mercy for our dear sister right
[44:49] now. Strengthen the whole family with
[44:52] faith and let there be indeed this great
[44:55] miracle that has been requested of thee.
[44:57] We commit it to you as a group, as a
[44:59] body of believers in Jesus name. Amen.
[45:03] Praise the Lord.
[45:06] Amen. Praise the Lord. Um,
[45:10] so again today just trying to get my
[45:14] mind focused on everything that I that I
[45:17] would like to cover today and it's going
[45:20] to be uh somewhat narrow. Now I promise
[45:23] you it'll be a little more than we
[45:24] covered on Wednesday. Um because
[45:27] Wednesday we were just so pressed for
[45:30] time and I kind of had it in my mind to
[45:32] refresh you and get us all um refreshed
[45:35] because we had had a break in between.
[45:37] And when you're on these kinds of things
[45:39] like prophecy, then it can become you
[45:42] forget and then then you know I feel
[45:44] like I have to go back and relay a
[45:46] foundation. So I didn't want to do that.
[45:47] So Wednesday night we we refreshed you
[45:50] and then we took just a few steps
[45:51] forward. Today I want to go on from
[45:54] there and um I I want to take today now
[45:59] to the booth. I will say that this is
[46:01] the next part in my series on modern
[46:04] events uh that are again made clear in
[46:07] prophecy. But I want to take today as a
[46:10] subtitle and mainly for your sake. They
[46:13] don't necessarily post this on the
[46:15] website. They just post that it's this
[46:17] part of the series. But to capture your
[46:19] minds where we're headed today deeply is
[46:23] I want to take this subtitle. Behold his
[46:26] image again. Behold his image again. Now
[46:31] because I have said to you repeatedly in
[46:34] this series that yes, we are taking
[46:38] historical events and we are making them
[46:41] clear in prophecy. Not just events at
[46:44] the end of the 19th century as we have
[46:46] done rather extensively. Not merely
[46:49] events going into the early part of the
[46:51] 20th century as we have done rather
[46:53] extensively, you know. um but and and
[46:56] then not just events that were in the
[46:59] life of God's prophet through the 40s,
[47:01] 50s and 60s, but we felt the need to
[47:03] bring it again today. And we just had a
[47:06] milestone event uh something a prophecy
[47:10] that had been on the book for 70 plus
[47:12] years
[47:14] has now become flesh.
[47:17] Yeah. Amen. I can say to you today, I
[47:20] can go back and read that prophecy from
[47:22] 71 years ago and I can say to you today,
[47:25] this day, this prophecy is fulfilled in
[47:28] your hearing. Think of that, friends.
[47:31] Think of the privilege that you are
[47:33] seeing something that has not been seen
[47:36] ever in the history of the of the New
[47:39] Testament era. you know, they came to
[47:41] Paul and they they began
[47:45] certain ones began to go around saying
[47:47] because they they got I don't know,
[47:49] maybe they got impatient, maybe they
[47:51] didn't understand why Jesus wasn't right
[47:53] back and so they began to formulate
[47:56] theories that maybe he had come already
[47:59] and oh well the whole rapture must be a
[48:02] spiritual thing. You hear it today. You
[48:04] get people who cannot wait on the Lord
[48:07] and run ahead of the Lord. And I just
[48:09] want to say to you today as a church,
[48:10] don't ever do that. Just let the Lord
[48:13] open his will before you. And just make
[48:15] sure you walk forward into it. Don't try
[48:18] to fix it, create it, manipulate it,
[48:20] control it. Just say, "Lord, let me
[48:23] humble myself to whatever your will is
[48:26] for my life."
[48:27] And that's always I promise that if you
[48:30] do that, you'll always come out good.
[48:34] you. And now it might not at at
[48:36] sometimes might not always seem like
[48:39] something that's good, but just remember
[48:42] that the Bible doesn't promise
[48:44] everything will be good. It promises
[48:47] that all things will work together for
[48:49] your good.
[48:50] And so you have to sometimes you have to
[48:52] have that law of contrast. Sometimes,
[48:55] you know, to appreciate uh a sunny
[48:58] Sunday, we've got a rainy Sunday to
[49:00] appreciate, you know, good health.
[49:02] Sometimes we have to endure a trial of
[49:05] sickness. And I was just hearing last
[49:07] night or this morning, brother Brandham
[49:09] talking about how that when you go into
[49:11] a trial, he was so um explicit on this.
[49:15] He wasn't being, you know, vague. It
[49:18] wasn't talking around it. He said, in
[49:20] fact is he pauses his audience to say,
[49:22] "Now, I don't want you to miss this.
[49:25] Really pay attention." I'm going to tell
[49:27] you something. When a prophet tells me,
[49:28] "Pay attention."
[49:30] Yes, sir. Amen.
[49:31] Here's something coming. And he says
[49:33] when you have a trial
[49:36] that don't get discouraged because that
[49:39] is God saying to you, I have observed
[49:43] you. I trust you and I'm going to bring
[49:46] this trial to lift you and elevate you
[49:49] and improve you. Don't get scared. Don't
[49:52] be afraid. Don't back up. Don't think
[49:55] I've left you. I'm actually This is all
[49:58] my hand. And when it's over, if you stay
[50:02] the course and don't run for the hills,
[50:04] when you come out of this thing on the
[50:06] other side, and you will,
[50:08] oh yeah,
[50:09] the law of contrast will force you out
[50:12] of that trial because that that would
[50:15] then there wouldn't be contrast if your
[50:16] whole life was just one long trial. So
[50:19] the whole every every you know, that's
[50:21] what makes valleys. They're bookended by
[50:23] mountains and mountains get bookended by
[50:25] valleys and that's why you have mountain
[50:26] ranges and and then you have planes and
[50:29] so so this is how God runs. And so you
[50:31] don't want to you just want to keep
[50:33] going forward. Remember that that flying
[50:36] eagle is high up in the atmosphere. He
[50:39] sees over that next hill. He knows
[50:42] what's best. Just trust him.
[50:45] Amen.
[50:46] See, so so we the the whole plan is God
[50:53] is molding you into the perfection of
[50:58] his image bearer. That's what man was
[51:00] created for was to be an image bearer of
[51:04] God. And so that's why, you know, I I I
[51:07] I'm not going to do it today. There's a
[51:09] wonderful Hebrew breakdown. Uh a Jewish
[51:12] rabbi did a breakdown on the Old
[51:13] Testament. He's messianic. And so it
[51:15] meant a lot to him how that, you know,
[51:18] God used a certain Greek word, I'm
[51:21] sorry, a certain Hebrew word when he's
[51:23] building the the seas and the flowers
[51:25] and the trees and it's just a very
[51:27] little bit uh there's very few words in
[51:29] that. And then when he's building the
[51:32] whales and the and the cattle and the
[51:34] beast of the field and he's coming all
[51:36] the way up and through day one, through
[51:38] day two, day three, day four, day five,
[51:40] he uses very small description. He's it
[51:43] it's amazing because he's creating the
[51:46] heavens and the earth.
[51:47] He's creating the stars and all the
[51:49] glory and he's hanging his first Bible,
[51:51] but he's using very little language
[51:53] until he gets to day six. And in day
[51:56] six, it's probably four to five maybe
[51:58] maybe as at least times uh the language
[52:02] that he uses because he's trying to get
[52:04] you to understand that my image bearsers
[52:07] are more important than all the stars
[52:09] and all the whales and all the trees and
[52:12] all the heavens.
[52:14] Amen.
[52:14] God had a desire to make you his image
[52:18] bearer. And that's what's up. Yes. Amen.
[52:23] That's what your life is about. I
[52:25] promise you. All the trials and
[52:27] tribulations, the fact that you became a
[52:29] believer, the fact that one day you
[52:32] heard an eagle scream, you recognized
[52:34] it, you heard, you recognized and you
[52:36] acted upon the word of God. And you know
[52:38] why you acted? Cuz you couldn't not.
[52:41] It was really not about persuasion.
[52:43] People who are just persuaded in can be
[52:45] dissuaded out. My our good friend,
[52:48] Brother Burley, says, "Brother Jason, I
[52:50] learned a long time ago that if somebody
[52:52] can get you in with a hot dog, somebody
[52:54] will get you out with a hamburger."
[52:58] Or if they get you in with a hamburger,
[52:59] they'll get you out with a hot dog.
[53:01] Yeah.
[53:02] And and so we're not persuaded. The
[53:04] bride cannot really uh because we don't
[53:08] even understand all of the word of God.
[53:11] So it's not that we are that we believe
[53:15] what we're persuaded of. It's that we
[53:17] can only believe what is revealed to us.
[53:21] And so when when the word is revealed to
[53:23] us, then that becomes God in person. And
[53:26] then then that revelation
[53:29] performs the magical the the the actual
[53:32] real magic of performing a supernatural
[53:35] new birth in you. so that you are now
[53:38] the living word made flesh in the earth.
[53:40] Amen.
[53:42] So he's the whole plan has always been
[53:44] to make you image bearsers. And so every
[53:47] trial, every affliction, everything,
[53:50] every promotion, every as long as you're
[53:53] letting God uh drive your career, drive
[53:56] your life, drive your decisions, then
[53:59] you'll come into the image bearer that
[54:01] he's desired you to be.
[54:03] Amen.
[54:05] Now, the the caveat is that he won't
[54:08] force you. Even his children, he won't
[54:09] force them. If you're determined to be
[54:12] more like the world than his child, then
[54:14] I mean, you're in the palms of his hand.
[54:16] He can never lose you. But boy, are you
[54:18] going to lose out?
[54:20] Amen.
[54:21] My goodness, are you going to lose out
[54:22] bringing God glory? Are you going to
[54:24] lose out on the better life? Are you
[54:26] going to ever lose out? Don't do it.
[54:28] Say, "Lord, I'm not the guide to my own
[54:31] life. I'm retiring as general manager of
[54:33] the universe. I want you to lead me,
[54:36] whatever that means.
[54:42] I want to look, brother Mark, at first
[54:44] John chapter 4.
[54:48] And so, and I and I just thought I
[54:51] better go here before I go much further
[54:54] or I wouldn't get to it. First John 4,
[54:58] and we want to look at verses 7-1 17.
[55:02] We'll have it on the screen, I'm sure.
[55:05] Uh 1 John 4:7.
[55:08] Now, watch because
[55:11] um and let me let me just say this. Let
[55:16] me kind of pre-qualify what you're about
[55:17] to read. Please don't get sidetracked in
[55:22] your mind on the surface level of
[55:25] saying, "I just need to be more loving."
[55:29] While that's true, that's not the point
[55:31] I'm about to make. The point that I'm
[55:34] going to make, and I'm going to give it
[55:36] to you ahead of time so you get it as I
[55:39] read it, is what we're reading here in
[55:42] this is the same John who said in his
[55:45] gospel, "No man hath seen God at any
[55:49] time, but the only begotten son hath
[55:52] declared him."
[55:53] Right? So now, John, this same John is
[55:56] going to say that again here in a
[55:58] moment. And he's going to say, "No man
[56:00] hath seen God at any time." But now he's
[56:03] going to turn it not to the Nazarene,
[56:05] but he's going to Who was the word made
[56:07] flesh? But to you,
[56:09] the body, the word made flesh, the bride
[56:11] of Christ. And he's going to say, "Now
[56:14] you're going to know that the same life
[56:16] that lived in him lives in you." Because
[56:20] he was not, he didn't have love. He was
[56:23] loved.
[56:24] When you are loved, that was the only
[56:27] thing that could hold at Calvary. There
[56:30] there nobody could have endured that
[56:32] just because they loved had love for
[56:35] someone. But when you are the essence of
[56:38] love and when you can look upon your
[56:40] seed and be content that you're about to
[56:42] be mutilated and murdered, but you can
[56:45] see your seed and be satisfied,
[56:47] Amen.
[56:48] that that's about to happen to you.
[56:50] Amen.
[56:51] when he has a human will that says I
[56:54] don't want to die let it pass
[56:55] nevertheless
[56:57] not my will thine be done knowing full
[57:00] well what that meant
[57:02] so now John is not here saying you need
[57:06] to be more kind and more loving John is
[57:09] going to say you need to have the same
[57:13] person of love living inside you and you
[57:17] then become an image bearer like he did
[57:20] amen
[57:20] No man hath seen God at any time, but
[57:24] the only begotten of the father hath
[57:26] declared him in this day and hour.
[57:28] Nobody has seen God at any time. But he
[57:31] has a family here.
[57:33] Amen.
[57:33] Who who who who hold his life within
[57:37] them. And now the world sees God through
[57:40] his elect.
[57:42] Amen.
[57:44] Make sense?
[57:45] Now with that kind of a a view, let's
[57:48] read.
[57:51] 1 John 4:7, "Beloved,
[57:54] let us love one another. For love is of
[57:58] God, and everyone that loveth is born of
[58:01] God and knoweth God." Well, that should
[58:04] make sense to you because God is love.
[58:08] So, if you have love, you're born of
[58:10] God. If you if you're not born of God,
[58:14] you have you can have all the human love
[58:17] and human affection. This is exactly why
[58:19] we tell our young people, don't dare
[58:22] marry someone who doesn't have the
[58:23] baptism of the Holy Ghost. Because they
[58:26] may have a tremendous amount of human
[58:27] love for you, but that'll be up and down
[58:30] and in and out and on and off. And it
[58:31] might not always be true. But if they're
[58:33] born again, the love of God, the life of
[58:36] God, which is love, is poured into us by
[58:40] the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[58:42] See,
[58:43] so beloved, let us love one another, for
[58:46] love is of God, and everyone that loveth
[58:48] is born of God, and knoweth God. He that
[58:51] loveth not God, I'm sorry, he that
[58:54] loveth not knoweth not God. For God is
[58:58] love. So, he's never been born again if
[59:00] he doesn't have that's that's really all
[59:02] he's saying. If you're born again, then
[59:04] you have love. If you're not born again,
[59:07] you may have human emotion, but you
[59:09] don't have love cuz love's a person.
[59:12] God doesn't have love. God is love.
[59:15] Amen.
[59:17] In this was manifested the love of God.
[59:20] Now catch it. Manifested or declared.
[59:22] Same meaning. Manifested or declared. No
[59:25] man hath seen God at any time but the
[59:26] son hath declared him. Right? In this
[59:29] was manifested the love of God toward us
[59:32] because that God sent his only begotten
[59:36] son into the world that we might live
[59:39] through him that we might manifest
[59:41] through him that we might declare the
[59:43] father. See through the indwelling life
[59:46] of Christ herein is love. Not that we
[59:49] love God but that he loved us and sent
[59:52] his son to be the propitiation of our
[59:54] sins. Beloved, if God so loved us, we
[59:59] ought also to love one another. No,
[1:00:02] there there's there's almost nothing
[1:00:05] guaranteed to cause schism in a church
[1:00:08] than make believers.
[1:00:10] Amen.
[1:00:11] It's almost never unbelievers,
[1:00:13] right?
[1:00:13] Because unbelievers are just humble
[1:00:15] about it. They don't even mind you
[1:00:16] knowing. I'm here cuz I like it, but I'm
[1:00:18] really not a believer. But I'll be
[1:00:19] respectful. But it's but it's people who
[1:00:23] who don't have what they think they
[1:00:25] have. Yeah.
[1:00:26] And then they get carried about by every
[1:00:28] wind of doctrine which the Holy Ghost
[1:00:29] would prevent. Then they're carnal. They
[1:00:32] get jealous. They get mad. They have a
[1:00:33] temper. They get angry. They cause
[1:00:35] division. They gossip.
[1:00:39] Amen.
[1:00:40] See, that's the sign. That's the mark of
[1:00:42] a of a makeeliever. I'm not saying you
[1:00:44] don't really believe. I'm saying you
[1:00:46] need to go back to an altar and get the
[1:00:48] real thing. And don't get up until you
[1:00:50] are a new creation in Christ Jesus. Wow.
[1:00:54] Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought
[1:00:57] also to love one another. No man hath
[1:00:59] seen God at any time. See, he says it
[1:01:02] again. Same as same as in his gospel. No
[1:01:04] man hath seen God at any time. If we
[1:01:07] love one another, God dwelleth in us,
[1:01:09] and his love is perfected in us. Can you
[1:01:12] see what he's saying?
[1:01:13] No man hath seen God at any time. This
[1:01:16] is just like Jesus. But the life Jesus
[1:01:19] lived displayed who God was. The Jews
[1:01:22] could never doubt who God was. They
[1:01:24] could never doubt his character and his
[1:01:26] nature because they saw Jesus.
[1:01:28] Yeah.
[1:01:28] They they didn't just meet him. They
[1:01:31] lived with him.
[1:01:32] They observed him.
[1:01:34] When they sent temple guards to arrest
[1:01:36] him and they came back without him and
[1:01:38] they said, "Where's he at?" And they
[1:01:40] said, "We don't have him." Oh, have you
[1:01:42] become believers? They said, "Well, no
[1:01:43] man ever spake like this man."
[1:01:45] Right. Amen.
[1:01:47] which was a pretty much of a slap in the
[1:01:48] face to these elders
[1:01:50] because you know you guys haven't spoke
[1:01:52] like him either.
[1:01:56] So, so you know it's a kind of a tongue
[1:01:58] and cheek thing you know like Jesus said
[1:02:01] if I by the if I by the if I by the
[1:02:05] finger of God uh do these miracles um
[1:02:09] tell me please exactly uh what how is it
[1:02:11] your sons are doing the miracles? Oh,
[1:02:14] they're not. Oh, okay. Oh, I see. Okay.
[1:02:18] Okay. Oh, they're not, are they? Oh,
[1:02:21] well. Okay. So, no man hath seen God at
[1:02:24] any time. If we love one another, God
[1:02:27] dwelleth in us, and his love is
[1:02:29] perfected. His love is displayed. His
[1:02:31] love is manifested. Can I just say it
[1:02:33] like this? Quit thinking of the fuzzy
[1:02:35] feeling. His life is displayed. His life
[1:02:38] is manifested.
[1:02:40] Real love sometimes is not fuzzy. Right?
[1:02:43] Sometimes real love can be corrective.
[1:02:46] Sometimes real love will be honest. You
[1:02:49] if you really want to know who your
[1:02:50] friends are, it's those who will be
[1:02:52] honest with you.
[1:02:53] That's a real friend. Someone who'll be
[1:02:55] honest with you. Don't don't rub them up
[1:02:58] rub them out of your life because
[1:02:59] they're the only ones who will tell you
[1:03:01] the truth. For goodness sake,
[1:03:03] you need truthful friends who'll say,
[1:03:05] you know, I really love you, but we need
[1:03:07] to talk about something.
[1:03:09] And then they're willing to have you
[1:03:11] also. It it's always a two-way street.
[1:03:14] We're we're all in this thing together
[1:03:17] if the love of God dwell in us. See,
[1:03:21] so he says,
[1:03:28] "No man hath seen God at any time. If we
[1:03:30] love one another, God dwelleth in us,
[1:03:32] and his love is perfected in us. Hereby
[1:03:34] know we that we dwell in him and he in
[1:03:38] us because he hath given us of his
[1:03:41] spirit. And we have seen and do testify
[1:03:44] that the father sent the son to be the
[1:03:46] savior of the world. Whosoever shall
[1:03:49] confess that Jesus is the son of God.
[1:03:52] God dwelleth in him and he in God. We're
[1:03:55] not just talking his whole subject is
[1:03:58] not just lip service to God. It's it's
[1:04:01] that it's that when he's saying that
[1:04:04] that whosoever shall confess that that
[1:04:07] that's a lifestyle. Your life is a lived
[1:04:10] voice. Anybody can confess the devil
[1:04:13] confesses Jesus is the Lord
[1:04:16] [Applause]
[1:04:17] Amen.
[1:04:18] The devil knows who he is and and and
[1:04:20] brother Brandon would go on to say the
[1:04:21] devil even knows he knows what he wants
[1:04:23] done but he refuses to do it
[1:04:26] because he's he's in rebellion,
[1:04:28] unreoverable rebellion. And so when when
[1:04:32] you let the devil start leading your
[1:04:33] life, you're going to end up eventually
[1:04:36] in unreoverable rebellion to the degree
[1:04:38] that if you're his child, he'll just
[1:04:40] have to remove you from the planet.
[1:04:41] Right?
[1:04:42] Amen.
[1:04:43] Cuz he's not going to lose.
[1:04:46] All right. So he goes on, let me catch
[1:04:48] these last two uh two verses. Verse 16.
[1:04:53] And we have known and believed the love
[1:04:55] that God hath to us. God is love. He
[1:04:58] says it again, not he has it, he is it.
[1:05:01] And he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in
[1:05:05] God and God in him. Herein, this is how.
[1:05:09] Here's how you know our love is made
[1:05:12] perfect. Herein our love is made
[1:05:14] perfect. Our love is on display that we
[1:05:17] may have boldness in the day of
[1:05:19] judgment. Because as he is, so are we in
[1:05:22] the world. That's a pretty good deal.
[1:05:25] I'd like for God to look at me the same
[1:05:28] way he looked at Christ.
[1:05:30] I'd like for my life to bring honor and
[1:05:32] glory to the father in the same way
[1:05:35] Jesus life brought that.
[1:05:36] Amen.
[1:05:38] Amen.
[1:05:39] So
[1:05:42] um why is that? Okay.
[1:05:48] Yeah. So when we when we start to look
[1:05:51] at this now we we showed you last night
[1:05:54] how that you know it was a great plan
[1:05:58] that brother Brandham talks about going
[1:06:00] coming down through the ages and
[1:06:03] and I'm I'm not going to recap all of
[1:06:05] that again. We've talked about it
[1:06:06] extensively but you know a seal
[1:06:09] partially opened in every age. A
[1:06:11] messenger caught it ran with it. people
[1:06:12] gathered. The the they died and he laid
[1:06:15] them to sleep in the age and then the
[1:06:18] they denominated and then a temporary
[1:06:20] plague from that vial partially was open
[1:06:23] and dropped down onto the earth and it
[1:06:25] came up through all the way through the
[1:06:26] church ages and through the seals and
[1:06:29] through the trumpets and through the
[1:06:30] ages and it's all working up toward the
[1:06:32] end time where it becomes a big cluster.
[1:06:34] We talked about that Wednesday. And he
[1:06:36] says this is a great plan till it comes
[1:06:38] to the end to the last messenger. And he
[1:06:41] says a curious thing.
[1:06:44] Now this last day messenger has no
[1:06:47] certain message
[1:06:50] because watch now. You've got to
[1:06:51] understand that the last day messenger
[1:06:54] had a dual role. He was the angel to the
[1:06:57] church of Leodysia.
[1:06:59] Yeah.
[1:07:00] See, and he was born out of season. He
[1:07:02] came on the scene. They were already
[1:07:04] denominated from Isuza. He came on the
[1:07:06] scene. He's baptizing on the river in
[1:07:08] 33. That's decades after Isuza. And then
[1:07:12] he's moving among them in the 40s and
[1:07:14] the 50s and the 60s. And they can't deny
[1:07:16] the supernatural in his ministry. It's
[1:07:18] impossible to deny. It's known the world
[1:07:21] over and it's provable.
[1:07:23] Just like when brother Brandon would say
[1:07:25] there in Houston when the picture was
[1:07:26] taken and he said, you know, you can
[1:07:28] question this and question that. He
[1:07:30] says, but now as it regards that
[1:07:32] presence of that light, he said, that
[1:07:34] can be proven. And they did prove it.
[1:07:37] and they took a picture of it. To this
[1:07:39] day, it's authenticated. And so, so we
[1:07:42] realize then that he said he has no
[1:07:44] certain mystery in that first half of
[1:07:46] his ministry. He he had no certain
[1:07:49] ministry. He just was simply trying to
[1:07:53] uh trying to guide that age as best as
[1:07:56] he could. That age would eventually kick
[1:08:00] Christ out and he would that prophet
[1:08:02] would turn around and indict them for
[1:08:04] it.
[1:08:05] Amen. So then he comes to the message of
[1:08:07] the opening of the seals. And now
[1:08:09] Malachi 4, the spirit of Elijah is going
[1:08:12] to come into play. And so we find that
[1:08:15] brother Ram says he takes the book and
[1:08:17] of seals and breaks them and shows the
[1:08:20] seventh angel. And here it is for this
[1:08:23] alone the mysteries of God is the
[1:08:27] ministry of the seventh angel.
[1:08:29] Amen. So the mystery of the seventh
[1:08:31] angel, the his ministry are the
[1:08:34] mysteries of God to make them known. Not
[1:08:36] just by preaching but by demonstration.
[1:08:39] So that then when you eat upon the book,
[1:08:41] you also become the book. As you eat
[1:08:44] upon the living word, you become the
[1:08:46] living word.
[1:08:47] That's not hard to follow.
[1:08:50] He talks about he says then there's this
[1:08:52] is all in the first seal is where we
[1:08:54] didn't get to Wednesday. Then there
[1:08:56] comes forth seven mysterious thunders.
[1:08:58] That's not even written at all. That's
[1:09:00] right. Now, this is brother Brandham's
[1:09:02] early uh understanding of this. He's
[1:09:04] going to find out later. He says later
[1:09:07] in his ministry after the seals have
[1:09:09] been open and and and it keeps unwinding
[1:09:11] because it kept unwinding to him as
[1:09:13] well. That's why brother Brandon would
[1:09:15] come to uh you know what is the
[1:09:17] attraction on the mountain? this day the
[1:09:19] scriptur is fulfilled and you know uh is
[1:09:22] the rising of the sun and you know he he
[1:09:24] comes to all those and in one place he
[1:09:26] looks back and he says you know in this
[1:09:28] day the scriptur is fulfilled what
[1:09:30] happened back there in t in in in the in
[1:09:34] the coronada forest north of Tucson see
[1:09:37] and so even to brother Brandham it was
[1:09:39] becoming a greater reality my goodness I
[1:09:42] I thought I knew what happened now I'm
[1:09:44] two years in and I realized even more
[1:09:46] than even I thought was happening was
[1:09:49] happening.
[1:09:51] And now here we are decades later. I'm
[1:09:53] here to tell you something, friends. He
[1:09:55] doesn't have to worry about waiting on a
[1:09:57] little girl to grow up. She's a mature
[1:09:59] bride now.
[1:10:00] She's ready for his coming. She's ready
[1:10:02] for that flight to the skies for the
[1:10:05] marriage of the lamb. She's married
[1:10:06] here. The wedding supper is there. See?
[1:10:10] And so, so, and how does she get how
[1:10:12] does she married here? Well, how does
[1:10:14] anyone get married? They stand in front
[1:10:16] of the presence of an of a of an officer
[1:10:19] and say, "I do. I will take this man.
[1:10:22] Take this woman. I do. I will." And and
[1:10:25] and the bride comes at the end time. And
[1:10:28] now the man, Christ, the word is
[1:10:29] standing before her and she is saying,
[1:10:31] "I do. I will. I will take you, Jesus,
[1:10:35] to be my guide, to be my lawfully wedded
[1:10:38] husband."
[1:10:40] Amen. And
[1:10:42] the rest of the world won't do it.
[1:10:45] So, so he here he says there's coming
[1:10:49] forth seven mysterious thunders that's
[1:10:51] not even written at all. That's right.
[1:10:53] And I believe that through these seven
[1:10:55] thunders will be revealed in the last
[1:10:58] days in order to get the bride together
[1:11:00] for rapturing faith. Now, let me say
[1:11:02] this,
[1:11:04] brother Brandham. Later, he he's not
[1:11:07] going to change
[1:11:09] um
[1:11:12] um this doctrinal teaching. The
[1:11:15] doctrinal teaching is the seven thunders
[1:11:19] will be revealed uh in order to get the
[1:11:22] bride together for rapturing faith.
[1:11:25] That's that doesn't get changed ever.
[1:11:27] But he does make an amendment to the
[1:11:30] first part of it later years after the
[1:11:32] seals. And he says, "I used to think,"
[1:11:35] he did, you can read it. He says, "I
[1:11:37] used to think it was something on the
[1:11:38] backside, something outside the Bible."
[1:11:40] He said, "But I found out it can't be
[1:11:43] anything outside of God's word."
[1:11:45] See, so we learn later that it must be
[1:11:48] something in the scriptures. So it's so
[1:11:51] it so now what you're seeing is
[1:11:54] what is it that that is going to perfect
[1:11:58] a bride and get her ready for a rapture.
[1:12:02] It'll be the restoration of what you
[1:12:04] read in Acts chapter 2.
[1:12:06] Amen. that the Jubilee comes, that the
[1:12:10] presence of God comes among the people.
[1:12:13] Now, it's not his coming. It's his
[1:12:15] appearing.
[1:12:16] Yeah.
[1:12:17] It's just his appearing. He's among
[1:12:19] them. How How is he appearing? It's the
[1:12:22] ministry of the son of man working in
[1:12:24] the people. You say, and then sometimes
[1:12:26] people get so confused. I I am
[1:12:29] astonished at how people can just not
[1:12:31] catch the whole thing at high altitude.
[1:12:33] And you know, you get things like, well,
[1:12:36] you know, now he's no longer the lamb of
[1:12:38] God. He's no longer interceding. The
[1:12:40] seals are open. Now it's he's judgment.
[1:12:42] Now it's the lion. And and you know, it
[1:12:44] all jams up. And well, then then how do
[1:12:46] I get forgiven for my sins if he's no
[1:12:48] longer interceding? If he's not still
[1:12:50] doing the work of the lamb and you say,
[1:12:52] you know, he's not the lamb of God. He's
[1:12:53] the lion of the tribe of Judah. Well, of
[1:12:55] course he is. Uh the ministry of the son
[1:12:57] of man, you know, he he's no longer the
[1:13:00] lamb interceding. Can I just say to you
[1:13:01] today, don't ever confuse what he's
[1:13:04] doing in the earth with what he is in
[1:13:05] heaven.
[1:13:06] What he is and what he's doing can be
[1:13:08] two different things. What he's doing in
[1:13:10] the ministry of the son of man is he's
[1:13:12] living inside of a people and the word
[1:13:14] is made flesh in the earth. That was
[1:13:15] what was happening in in Acts chapter 2.
[1:13:18] Amen.
[1:13:19] And it and it didn't require the
[1:13:21] understanding of the apostles. Even Paul
[1:13:24] wasn't even on the scene yet. But God
[1:13:27] was birthing a church by the prophecy of
[1:13:30] Joel, by the prophecy of Ezekiel, by the
[1:13:33] prophecy in the Psalms, that God was
[1:13:35] going to tabernacle inside a people. And
[1:13:38] that would be the word made flesh. And
[1:13:40] that's what we've been restored back to.
[1:13:44] No man have seen God at any time, but
[1:13:46] the only begotten hath declared him.
[1:13:49] Praise God.
[1:13:51] Amen. You see, look at the declaration
[1:13:53] and how misunderstood the declaration
[1:13:56] was because of the way they were talking
[1:13:59] and acting. The world thought they're
[1:14:01] drunk.
[1:14:02] Yeah.
[1:14:03] Peter said, "You're mistaken. This is
[1:14:05] not what what it looks like to you. If
[1:14:08] you really understood the Bible, this is
[1:14:10] what Joel prophesied.
[1:14:13] This is what Ezekiel talked about. This
[1:14:14] is what David It would take Paul to
[1:14:16] really farret all of that out later and
[1:14:19] take it all the way back. I mean, you
[1:14:21] know, that that that's where the
[1:14:23] divinity of Jesus Christ is so declared
[1:14:27] because, you know, when when you get
[1:14:29] books like like 1 Corinthians 15, I
[1:14:32] mean, that's the very first place that
[1:14:34] the world had an actual document where
[1:14:38] where Paul there in 1 Corinthians 15 uh
[1:14:41] I'm sorry, 1 Corinthians um I believe
[1:14:44] the 8th chapter where Paul is really
[1:14:46] dealing with the divinity of Jesus
[1:14:48] Christ. And that that was an
[1:14:50] understanding to the church prior to
[1:14:52] even the gospels being written.
[1:14:55] You understand? So, and Paul was
[1:14:57] conflating that divinity and taking it
[1:15:00] all the way back to the Old Testament to
[1:15:03] the Hebrew God. And there's where Paul
[1:15:05] was tying the two things together and
[1:15:07] saying he's not a second person. He's
[1:15:09] the person.
[1:15:11] But yet, we find that the word of God
[1:15:14] has already exploded on the scene. And
[1:15:16] it's the word made flesh. And that
[1:15:19] friends is what the message of the hour
[1:15:21] is all about. It's not because William
[1:15:23] Brandon was this, that, or the other.
[1:15:25] It's because God promised at the end
[1:15:27] time he would raise up a prophet under
[1:15:29] the spirit of Elijah and he would turn
[1:15:32] his church back to the original faith of
[1:15:34] the fathers and that would bring back
[1:15:36] again the original expression.
[1:15:40] That's why we have the all the power of
[1:15:42] Pentecost restored. We're not talking
[1:15:44] about Isuza. Right?
[1:15:46] That was just a third phase of a
[1:15:47] four-stage restoration of the bride
[1:15:49] tree. That even that wasn't the that
[1:15:52] wasn't the long-awaited restoration we'd
[1:15:54] waited for for 2,000 years. That would
[1:15:56] come under Malachi 4. And we've now
[1:15:58] listen friends, when you look at it and
[1:16:00] you you go back to Paul, and I got to be
[1:16:03] very careful how I say this list. I give
[1:16:05] you the wrong idea.
[1:16:07] So Paul, you I I've probably said this
[1:16:10] before here. I've said it many places.
[1:16:12] I'm sure I've said it here, but just to
[1:16:14] help your understanding.
[1:16:16] So, a prophet talks about how that a
[1:16:19] bride under her messenger is the final
[1:16:23] voice to the final age.
[1:16:25] Amen.
[1:16:26] Well, the reason that that's true is
[1:16:28] because
[1:16:30] Paul was the final voice for all the
[1:16:32] ages.
[1:16:33] Amen.
[1:16:34] And we've been restored back to that
[1:16:36] original foundation, which was Christ.
[1:16:38] And Paul said, "Nobody can change my
[1:16:39] foundation. Even I can't drop back and
[1:16:42] change it. Even an angel can't drop back
[1:16:43] and change it.
[1:16:45] It can't be altered. God, it came
[1:16:47] straight from God. And even God can't
[1:16:49] change it because God never changes his
[1:16:51] mind about his word.
[1:16:53] So nobody, I don't care how many years
[1:16:55] of divinity school they have, nobody has
[1:16:58] the authority to countermand the
[1:17:00] foundation that Paul laid down that
[1:17:03] Jesus was in fact the very God of heaven
[1:17:07] and that he wasn't a second or third
[1:17:09] person. he was the person.
[1:17:12] So they can change it with whatever
[1:17:14] document they want to produce. It
[1:17:15] doesn't change the truth of something.
[1:17:18] So So we find out then that and I and so
[1:17:21] I I'm saying all that to say this. So
[1:17:23] now when we when we come back to our day
[1:17:27] say, well, okay, so we've been restored
[1:17:30] back to that original day. Yes, that's
[1:17:33] true. And are we going to understand
[1:17:36] things beyond the Bible? No, nothing can
[1:17:40] come that's not in the scriptures.
[1:17:41] Amen.
[1:17:42] So, so everything that we're
[1:17:44] understanding doctrinally has to go back
[1:17:46] to the Bible. And it does. And that's
[1:17:49] provable.
[1:17:50] Amen.
[1:17:51] And and and and I and I accept all
[1:17:53] comers. I've defended the the teachings
[1:17:56] of the scripture by as a prophet taught
[1:17:59] them around the world. Never had anyone
[1:18:01] that could withstand it. And we say,
[1:18:03] "Come one, come all." Because the Bible
[1:18:05] explains itself. It doesn't need me to
[1:18:07] explain it. It interprets its own self
[1:18:09] very very good. It does a very good job
[1:18:11] of defending itself.
[1:18:13] Amen.
[1:18:13] And so this is why we see the
[1:18:15] supernatural moving in the way that it
[1:18:17] does. And and it's not just a babyhood.
[1:18:20] See, it's not just a babyhood. People uh
[1:18:23] they they they say, "Well, you know,
[1:18:25] when that which is perfect, it's come,
[1:18:26] then that which is in part is done
[1:18:28] away." And they're missing the the the
[1:18:31] immovable ancient landmark that God
[1:18:34] cannot be reduced.
[1:18:36] That's a reduction. If you say God used
[1:18:39] to be but now he no longer is. The
[1:18:41] church used to be but no longer is. Now
[1:18:43] you that's a reduction and you can't
[1:18:45] reduce God. You can't reduce his power.
[1:18:47] You can't reduce his signs and wonders.
[1:18:49] Yes. Because we came up out of a four
[1:18:52] stage restoration and we had to come up
[1:18:54] out of Luther and it wasn't the whole
[1:18:55] thing. And Wesley gave us more of the
[1:18:57] pie and it wasn't the whole thing and
[1:18:58] Isuza gave us more and then they
[1:19:00] denominated and then they split all up
[1:19:02] and then we're we're the products of
[1:19:04] that. We come up out of that stuff. And
[1:19:06] so we realize that that now that we've
[1:19:08] come to a maturity. Listen friends, when
[1:19:11] I was a baby, I sat in a high chair and
[1:19:14] made a mess.
[1:19:16] I ate with my fingers. I threw food. I
[1:19:18] dropped it all over the It's a good
[1:19:20] thing it was a big tray for a baby.
[1:19:22] They don't They don't They're just a
[1:19:24] baby. They make a big mess. They They
[1:19:26] eat. When I became a man, I still eat.
[1:19:29] Yeah. Amen. I didn't do away with
[1:19:31] eating, but now I use a spoon and a fork
[1:19:34] unless I'm eating fried chicken. And
[1:19:36] then I and then I'm careful to not make
[1:19:38] a mess. And if I spill any crumbs, I'll
[1:19:40] pick pick them up and eat them as well.
[1:19:43] Amen. So I So when I was a child, I ate
[1:19:46] like a child. Now that I'm an adult, I
[1:19:48] eat like an adult.
[1:19:50] So you don't reduce God from something,
[1:19:52] but but we have become a mature bride
[1:19:55] once again. and we are restored back cuz
[1:19:57] they didn't they didn't Paul didn't have
[1:19:59] to start correcting churches till after
[1:20:02] people be nobody came behind Peter and
[1:20:06] that 120 and said you guys are out of
[1:20:08] order you guys need to have this order
[1:20:10] you guys need to do this and do that and
[1:20:11] you got to have a room and a judgment
[1:20:13] nonsense Paul had to do that because the
[1:20:15] church began to become carnal
[1:20:18] and so if you're going to get if you're
[1:20:20] going to get humanly then the word has
[1:20:22] to deal with you humanly but we have
[1:20:24] been restored back to original faith of
[1:20:26] the fathers
[1:20:28] operating not not operating but
[1:20:31] operating with mature understanding
[1:20:34] in order decently properly like a mature
[1:20:37] person.
[1:20:38] Amen.
[1:20:40] When when a when a person just sits down
[1:20:42] and slop and food goes everywhere, you
[1:20:43] say, "Man, you need to grow up."
[1:20:46] See, you don't don't stop eating, but
[1:20:49] hey, get some etiquette. Get some
[1:20:50] manners about you because that's that's
[1:20:52] a that's a mess. See? So, so we All
[1:20:55] right, enough. Let me keep moving on. I
[1:20:57] don't want to get people's dander up.
[1:20:59] Anyway,
[1:21:02] all right.
[1:21:06] So when we look at what that early
[1:21:08] church faced, so I want to say very
[1:21:11] clearly they certainly Paul established
[1:21:15] the forever gospel that can never be
[1:21:18] added to taken from, changed, edited.
[1:21:23] Doesn't need addendums. It doesn't need
[1:21:24] anything from Elijah in this day.
[1:21:26] Doesn't need anything from you and me.
[1:21:28] That's right. But now let me just get
[1:21:30] you to let me take you to the next step.
[1:21:33] There were certainly things that this
[1:21:37] age faces that are quite unique
[1:21:41] to this age alone.
[1:21:43] Amen.
[1:21:44] I mean if you just think this through
[1:21:46] for a minute, Paul operated under the
[1:21:50] lion anointing which meant the pure
[1:21:52] word. But the only thing Paul really had
[1:21:56] to contend with was his Jewish brethren
[1:21:59] who are always trying to kill him.
[1:22:02] He had to contend with his Jewish
[1:22:03] brethren and he tried to get them to to
[1:22:05] make the transition over to the New
[1:22:07] Testament. He would argue with them and
[1:22:09] say or not argue but he would just say
[1:22:11] listen he said I if you're right then
[1:22:14] why is it that those high priests your
[1:22:16] high priest every year have to bring a
[1:22:17] new sacrifice that go back to the Old
[1:22:19] Testament. That wasn't the promise. The
[1:22:21] promise was that wasn't that that whole
[1:22:24] thing of lamb of bulls and goats and and
[1:22:27] a yearly sacrifice. Go back and read the
[1:22:29] promise. That's not what it was. That
[1:22:31] wasn't the endgame. The endgame was that
[1:22:33] there would be a the lamb of God
[1:22:36] and he would be a propitiation for
[1:22:38] everybody and we pass from death to life
[1:22:40] and never come back into the judgment
[1:22:42] again. And so I don't need a priest
[1:22:45] under the order of Aaron to go and make
[1:22:49] yearly intercessory for me. I am now
[1:22:52] under the order of Melchazdc who abideth
[1:22:54] a priest continually.
[1:22:56] I have a continual atonement for my life
[1:22:59] because I've received the full word. Oh,
[1:23:02] we are to rejoice, friends. That ought
[1:23:03] to just thrill our hearts today.
[1:23:06] Amen.
[1:23:07] Amen. Because it what it what it
[1:23:09] basically is saying to you is you don't
[1:23:11] need yearly to offer up uh the blood of
[1:23:14] bulls and goats because your stumblings
[1:23:17] and your mistakes can't be counted
[1:23:19] against you.
[1:23:22] There's no need for you to bring a daily
[1:23:23] lamb,
[1:23:24] right?
[1:23:24] There's no need. You're already
[1:23:26] forgiven.
[1:23:28] You're forgiven as soon as you repent.
[1:23:30] And I don't care if it's the 9114th time
[1:23:32] you've made that same mistake this week.
[1:23:35] The minute you repent from a true heart
[1:23:37] of repentance, you are forgiven
[1:23:39] completely. If we confess our sins, he
[1:23:41] is faithful and just to forgive us.
[1:23:43] Amen.
[1:23:44] And the lamb of God is interceding there
[1:23:46] until that last name on the roll is
[1:23:48] called and sealed in. Hallelujah.
[1:23:51] So, so we we we find out that it had to
[1:23:54] be something in the scripture. So, right
[1:23:57] here in Peter's sermon in Acts two,
[1:23:59] you've got Joel's prophecy, you've got
[1:24:00] Ezekiel, you've got David, you got
[1:24:02] Daniel. And so this is where in fact is
[1:24:06] this is where brother Brham would go
[1:24:09] back to the book of Leviticus. And if
[1:24:11] you go back to the the book of Leviticus
[1:24:14] in the in the 30th chapter, you're
[1:24:16] you'll find that that there was a that
[1:24:19] that on the um that on the day after the
[1:24:26] sacrifice,
[1:24:27] yeah,
[1:24:27] that which would be Sunday, the first
[1:24:30] day of the week, Jesus rose, right? And
[1:24:33] so you find that that when he rose that
[1:24:37] was that when you go back to the look
[1:24:39] look at Leviticus the day after that
[1:24:42] sacrifice is made there is like a
[1:24:45] Pentecost there is a waving of the
[1:24:47] sheath that this is the first one to
[1:24:51] come up out of the out of the crop. But
[1:24:54] 50 days later when the Pentecost fell uh
[1:24:58] 50 days later then that was another then
[1:25:00] the Jews actually brought another wave
[1:25:03] sheath because it followed that that
[1:25:05] with that Pentecostal feast. And I don't
[1:25:07] want to get into the trenches of that
[1:25:08] today because I'm not teaching on that.
[1:25:10] But brother Brandon would go back and
[1:25:12] show that that there had to come at the
[1:25:15] end time if we've been restored back to
[1:25:18] Acts 1 and two then there has to be
[1:25:21] another sheath waving. There has to be
[1:25:23] someone who says the fullness of the
[1:25:25] word has come back and there's a people
[1:25:29] whose lives there's a messenger and
[1:25:31] there's a people whose lives are like
[1:25:33] Jesus. Paul uses that argument to prove
[1:25:37] there would have to be a resurrection of
[1:25:39] the sleeping saints. Because if there
[1:25:42] wasn't then death would remain
[1:25:44] unconquered
[1:25:46] but because he rose you'll rise. Amen.
[1:25:50] But now watch
[1:25:53] the dead in Christ didn't rise in Paul's
[1:25:56] day.
[1:25:57] They looked for it. It didn't rise in
[1:25:59] the second or third or fourth, fifth,
[1:26:02] sixth, or even as the seventh one wound
[1:26:05] out. Brother Brandham finally got to the
[1:26:07] seventh when he said, "We can't even go
[1:26:08] in the rapture in the shape the church
[1:26:10] is in. And it can't even get any
[1:26:12] better." So you see why the seals had to
[1:26:14] be open. A prophet had to come on the
[1:26:16] scene. Elijah had to be anointed with an
[1:26:18] eagle anointing.
[1:26:20] Yeah.
[1:26:20] See, so because it's got to be
[1:26:22] restoration, but it's got to be a
[1:26:25] restoration to the original word. But
[1:26:26] now we're going to have a lot more to
[1:26:28] deal with.
[1:26:29] That Paul's age didn't have to deal
[1:26:30] with. He had to deal with his Jewish
[1:26:32] brethren.
[1:26:33] And he had to deal with the white horse
[1:26:35] rider.
[1:26:36] Amen.
[1:26:37] Of deception.
[1:26:38] And that was it. under while Paul fought
[1:26:42] off his Jewish brethren and fought off
[1:26:45] the effects of the of the white horse,
[1:26:47] Paul was able to build and construct the
[1:26:49] foundation of the word which is Christ
[1:26:51] Jesus. And then everything gets built on
[1:26:53] top of that according to the blueprint.
[1:26:55] Right?
[1:26:56] Amen.
[1:26:58] All right. But now when when we go back
[1:27:00] and look at at our day,
[1:27:04] Paul only had to face the white horse
[1:27:07] rider.
[1:27:08] Paul never had an eagle anointing. It
[1:27:13] wasn't needed. Paul didn't have to face
[1:27:16] the pale horse.
[1:27:18] Paul didn't have to face uh the double
[1:27:22] barrel effect of the days of Sodom and
[1:27:26] the days of Noah combined.
[1:27:29] Amen. Because we live in a day where
[1:27:32] those two powers are conjoined and
[1:27:34] they're simultaneously alive and well
[1:27:37] and active in the earth today. Satan in
[1:27:41] Paul's day only had had 4,000 years. And
[1:27:43] brother Brandham said God was going to
[1:27:45] give him 6,000 years like God had taken
[1:27:47] 6,000 years to build his Eden. Satan was
[1:27:50] going to get 6,000 years to build his.
[1:27:52] And that's why when Paul when they would
[1:27:54] even go around saying the resurrection
[1:27:56] has come already, Paul would say that's
[1:27:57] impossible because when that happens,
[1:28:00] the man of sin will be revealed.
[1:28:03] And that and that wasn't even the man of
[1:28:05] sin wasn't even on a throne at that
[1:28:07] time.
[1:28:08] He was just a it was just a saying, just
[1:28:10] a spirit. It became a saying. Then it
[1:28:12] became a doctrine. Then in the ages,
[1:28:13] they sat a man and put a triple crown on
[1:28:15] him and they had a Jezebel spirit and he
[1:28:18] and it was the place where Satan's seat
[1:28:20] is. You see how that works through the
[1:28:22] ages?
[1:28:23] And so so and and even even then even
[1:28:26] everything didn't happen at le oysia.
[1:28:27] Brother JD knows that not everything. I
[1:28:30] mean they were arguing you know the the
[1:28:32] patriarch of Constantinople was still
[1:28:34] arguing over supremacy of the church
[1:28:36] with the Roman uh leader. And finally
[1:28:39] the the the emperor in 606 at the end of
[1:28:42] the third age going into Thotyra the
[1:28:45] emperor settles the matter officially
[1:28:47] and says the bishop of Rome is the head
[1:28:49] of the church universal
[1:28:51] and he actually became the first legally
[1:28:54] recognized pope. Now they'll say Peter
[1:28:56] and then a whole they got a whole list
[1:28:58] of names after that nonsense, you know,
[1:29:00] but but the first one that came was
[1:29:03] actually 606 when now you've got
[1:29:06] Bonafice III who's now the first
[1:29:08] official pope.
[1:29:10] So you're understanding that now we've
[1:29:13] had 2,000 years since that time. So now
[1:29:16] what do we have that they didn't have in
[1:29:18] the first age? Now we have a completed
[1:29:23] Satan's Eden. Amen.
[1:29:25] He's now had 6,000 years. We have Satan
[1:29:29] now by the popular demand of the people
[1:29:32] has been made uh the god of this evil
[1:29:36] age cuz he's worshiped.
[1:29:38] Now, you don't get to be the god of the
[1:29:40] whole age just because you've got
[1:29:42] satanic people who read a satanic Bible
[1:29:45] and worship you. It's going to take a
[1:29:47] lot more than that. It's going to take
[1:29:49] all the worldly entertainment to pander
[1:29:51] after him. It's going to take have to
[1:29:53] take education and science agreeing with
[1:29:55] him. It's going to have to take pull
[1:29:57] pits agreeing with him. It's going to
[1:29:59] have to be an abandonment of the word.
[1:30:00] The backbone of motherhood's going to
[1:30:02] have to be broken. The whole nation's
[1:30:04] going to have to backslide and cross
[1:30:05] over between judgment and mercy in 56 to
[1:30:08] 57.
[1:30:10] You're going to have to have all of that
[1:30:12] in place. And now we come to the end.
[1:30:14] And here's where we are.
[1:30:16] I'm glad we've got that that spirit of
[1:30:19] that eagle, friends, that that that is
[1:30:21] flying over us now. And were it not for
[1:30:24] election, were it not for the bleeding
[1:30:26] word, were it not for the restoration of
[1:30:28] the power of Pentecost, were it not for
[1:30:30] the presence of the Holy Ghost, the
[1:30:32] appearing of Christ, the son of man in
[1:30:35] flesh, made alive, and Christ is
[1:30:37] revealed to the world
[1:30:39] through our lives. Amen.
[1:30:43] No man hath seen God at any time.
[1:30:46] God dwells in a thick darkness. He
[1:30:48] dwells in a cloudy pillar. You can't see
[1:30:50] him.
[1:30:51] Amen.
[1:30:52] See, no man hath seen him at any time,
[1:30:54] but the son declared him.
[1:30:55] And then he comes back. No man hath seen
[1:30:57] him at all, but the brideg declares him.
[1:31:00] Yeah. Amen.
[1:31:00] The word, not the word doctrinally,
[1:31:03] that's argued over.
[1:31:05] What can't be argued over is when the
[1:31:07] word's made flesh.
[1:31:08] Hallelujah. The reason that can't be
[1:31:11] debated is because it can't be
[1:31:14] impersonated.
[1:31:16] You can't impersonate that real life.
[1:31:18] There's no counterfeit to it for someone
[1:31:21] to point to. They can have all their
[1:31:23] same old tired 2,000-y old arguments
[1:31:26] about the resurrection and Jesus and the
[1:31:28] Gospels and translations and this many
[1:31:30] times. And they can argue all that. But
[1:31:32] when the power of God is moving among
[1:31:34] his people, no one can deny that.
[1:31:36] Hallelujah.
[1:31:38] When we literally can walk through a
[1:31:40] time Paul didn't have to deal with
[1:31:42] darkness covering the whole earth and
[1:31:44] gross darkness on the minds of the
[1:31:46] people.
[1:31:46] Amen.
[1:31:47] Under the effects of the of the of the
[1:31:49] pre-opening of the seventh vial. We are
[1:31:53] the ones who have come into that when
[1:31:55] the strength of the eagle, it would take
[1:31:58] the strength of the eagle uh because now
[1:32:02] we're we're coming to the time when the
[1:32:04] man of sin is to be revealed at the end
[1:32:07] time. And so when the strength of the
[1:32:09] eagle anointing had to be in place for
[1:32:13] the bride to withstand Satan's Eden
[1:32:15] because what we've got right now, you
[1:32:17] know, as brother Brandon would say, uh,
[1:32:20] he said in the quote, he said, "We're
[1:32:22] going to have to have something further.
[1:32:24] We're going to have to have," and he
[1:32:26] thinks it's something on the backside
[1:32:28] and not even in the Bible. Later on, he
[1:32:30] corrects it, but his point was that we
[1:32:32] can't have enough faith hardly for
[1:32:34] divine healing. We've got to have enough
[1:32:36] faith to be changed in a moment to be
[1:32:38] swept out of the earth. He says, "And
[1:32:41] all of these evildoers is the first
[1:32:43] seal." And the seven seals that's been
[1:32:45] working mysterious in the church, and we
[1:32:48] will find out in a minute. It even
[1:32:50] worked in the name of a church. They
[1:32:52] call themselves the church. You see, if
[1:32:54] that isn't right, he says, "I wondered
[1:32:56] why. I've been so against denomination,
[1:32:59] not really knowing why."
[1:33:00] Amen.
[1:33:02] So, so we find that it starts back,
[1:33:04] brother Brandham said it started back in
[1:33:06] a mild form and it just keeps getting
[1:33:09] worse and worse on down and people go
[1:33:13] right into it saying, "Oh yes, this is
[1:33:15] just fine." But in the days of these
[1:33:18] things are made known, they finally go
[1:33:20] so bad until they go plum into the
[1:33:23] tribulation period.
[1:33:25] Amen.
[1:33:26] because a false prophet prophesied them
[1:33:29] into it
[1:33:30] and they went there by by feeding on the
[1:33:33] word of a false prophet. What can happen
[1:33:35] for you and me if we feed on the living
[1:33:37] word of God?
[1:33:38] Amen.
[1:33:38] See,
[1:33:40] so so all right, let me let me turn turn
[1:33:42] for home. You still with me?
[1:33:44] Amen.
[1:33:46] So we find that you know he had said in
[1:33:49] Exodus 33 and he's speaking to Moses and
[1:33:52] he said thou canst not see my face for
[1:33:55] there shall no man see me and live. See
[1:33:59] so even Jesus
[1:34:01] now now let's look at that in the New
[1:34:04] Testament era or or what we would call
[1:34:07] you know the Christian era in the time
[1:34:08] of Jesus. We're in the Holy Ghost era
[1:34:10] now. The Christian era was when Christ
[1:34:12] was walking the earth and the Greeks
[1:34:14] come to see him. Sir, we would see Jesus
[1:34:16] and Jesus is going to clear this matter
[1:34:18] up. No man can see God and live. And so
[1:34:23] Jesus is clearing up this matter. When
[1:34:25] the Greeks tried to see him, he's going
[1:34:27] to interpret the Old Testament teaching.
[1:34:30] And it's basically at the end of the
[1:34:32] day, it's going to be this. It takes a
[1:34:34] new birth to see me and not die trying
[1:34:38] to see me.
[1:34:40] So if you're trying to see me, be
[1:34:42] careful because no man can see this
[1:34:45] great revelation outside of a new birth
[1:34:48] and live. And that's why you get people
[1:34:50] who have probed and tried and tried to
[1:34:52] see it and saw parts of it and it ended
[1:34:55] up destroying their lives.
[1:34:58] Amen.
[1:34:59] Because they had never actually been
[1:35:01] born again. And so it's rendered, "No
[1:35:04] man who has not died spiritually, no man
[1:35:08] who has not been reborn by the spirit of
[1:35:10] God can see me." And so now, now this is
[1:35:15] exactly why a man-made system of
[1:35:19] denominational religion does not and
[1:35:22] cannot express the word of God
[1:35:25] correctly.
[1:35:26] Amen.
[1:35:27] Because it only knows him after
[1:35:29] intellectualism. It cannot express the
[1:35:32] life. And so the the the life it it must
[1:35:36] manifest God's life, God's invisibility
[1:35:40] must manifest in something that can be
[1:35:42] seen. And that was to be a man. That was
[1:35:46] to be his image bearer. That was to be
[1:35:48] his perfect masterpiece. Brother
[1:35:50] Brandham says here in the God who is
[1:35:52] rich in mercy. I'm watching my time
[1:35:54] closely. Stay with me.
[1:35:56] God is the word and it was made flesh
[1:35:59] and dwelt among us. Now that he might
[1:36:02] bring forth the other attributes of God.
[1:36:06] Amen.
[1:36:06] The body Jesus was the body of God. An
[1:36:09] attribute. Moses seen him pass and back
[1:36:11] part of him. No man had seen his face.
[1:36:14] But now we see him. We have beheld him.
[1:36:18] The apostle says we handled him. And so
[1:36:22] him as the sacrifice. Catch it. Now
[1:36:25] we've seen him as the sacrifice. Now he
[1:36:29] was an attribute of God being displayed
[1:36:32] the word. That's what he was. That's
[1:36:34] what they were misunderstanding on the
[1:36:36] day of Pentecost. The the unbelievers
[1:36:39] were thinking these are drunk men and
[1:36:40] saying you're you're misunderstanding
[1:36:42] the image.
[1:36:44] No man have seen God and you're seeing
[1:36:46] him for the first time. Here's Joel's
[1:36:48] prophecy. Praise God.
[1:36:50] See, so it must come into his body as a
[1:36:54] continuation of his ministry in the son
[1:36:56] of man. So, so it's God himself. All
[1:36:59] right. I I I don't want to repeat
[1:37:01] myself. I want to come to my last point.
[1:37:06] All right.
[1:37:09] I'm turning the corner now. We're going
[1:37:10] to run for the finish line. I need about
[1:37:12] 15 minutes. You good?
[1:37:14] I let you off the hook Wednesday, so
[1:37:16] hang hang with me.
[1:37:19] So now we find that what's to be
[1:37:22] revealed at the end time is God himself
[1:37:24] who is love.
[1:37:25] Yeah.
[1:37:26] He's abiding with us.
[1:37:28] Amen.
[1:37:29] And he's living in us.
[1:37:31] He's living his life through us to the
[1:37:34] world.
[1:37:35] Yeah.
[1:37:36] That is the mission of the last day
[1:37:37] bride. That's how she's the final voice
[1:37:40] to the final age.
[1:37:41] Amen.
[1:37:41] Amen. See, so this was established, of
[1:37:46] course, in the original church and was
[1:37:48] to be repeated at the end of time when
[1:37:52] everything else would be fulfilled. Like
[1:37:54] what I said, the when when when when
[1:37:56] Sodom and Gomorrah, that spirit, when
[1:37:58] the spirit of Noah, when all of that
[1:38:00] returns, when it draws time for the man
[1:38:02] of sin to be revealed, when Satan has
[1:38:05] had 6,000 years to build his Eden, when
[1:38:07] Satan is the god of the evil age, when
[1:38:09] darkness is covering the earth and gross
[1:38:11] darkness has plagued the minds of men.
[1:38:13] Amen.
[1:38:14] All right.
[1:38:16] So once that happens, then you have
[1:38:18] everything else in place. And then all
[1:38:21] we're waiting for is for the last names
[1:38:24] on the roll to be secured behind the
[1:38:28] token.
[1:38:28] Amen.
[1:38:29] Cuz that's on display.
[1:38:31] See?
[1:38:31] Amen.
[1:38:32] And and then and then brother Brandham
[1:38:34] says, "Then the dead for hundreds of
[1:38:36] years will raise. And then we which are
[1:38:40] alive shall be changed and lifted from
[1:38:43] the earth together to meet the Lord in
[1:38:45] the air."
[1:38:46] Amen.
[1:38:46] What we know to be as a secret catching
[1:38:49] away. the world won't realize it.
[1:38:52] Now follow me. I've said this before,
[1:38:55] but I want to say it with great clarity
[1:38:57] today. So when the bride is lit, here's
[1:39:01] a sequence end time events. Remember
[1:39:03] friends, I've been telling you and
[1:39:05] telling you, you are you're the greatest
[1:39:09] example
[1:39:10] of a modern event made clear in
[1:39:13] prophecy.
[1:39:14] Even though it's Satan's Eden, even
[1:39:16] though he's he's the God, even though
[1:39:17] it's darkness over the earth and gross
[1:39:19] darkness on the people, even though it's
[1:39:20] Sodom and Gomorrah and Noah, you're
[1:39:22] still a believer, you're still standing
[1:39:24] when it's impossible
[1:39:27] because you've got more than a lion
[1:39:29] anointing cuz you don't have to stop the
[1:39:30] white horse. You got to keep the pale
[1:39:32] horse from riding.
[1:39:36] Amen.
[1:39:37] So when the bride is lifted from the
[1:39:39] earth, then the blood is lifted from the
[1:39:42] earth because she's the bleeding word.
[1:39:44] You're the blood of God by the spirit.
[1:39:45] Amen. Be
[1:39:46] because because brother that that ring
[1:39:48] that's like a bumper
[1:39:50] that that God can't really see the the
[1:39:53] earth and all of its sin. God has that
[1:39:55] ring there
[1:39:56] so that he don't destroy his own family.
[1:39:58] Amen.
[1:39:59] So that when your sins would get up to
[1:40:01] him, they're buried in that blood ring.
[1:40:03] But once the bride goes up, that ring
[1:40:05] vanishes and then God can see the earth
[1:40:07] in all of its ugly sin.
[1:40:09] See? And so the level of sin in the
[1:40:13] earth is exposed. And now the king moves
[1:40:17] to judgment with nothing to hinder the
[1:40:20] man of sin. He now rides out in his full
[1:40:23] power. And the tribulation is on.
[1:40:27] Amen.
[1:40:29] As the bride rises from the earth, the
[1:40:33] eagle anointing rises with her, but he
[1:40:36] doesn't fly back to the throne.
[1:40:40] Rather, instead, he flies east. He
[1:40:42] anoints Moses and Elijah and introduces
[1:40:45] himself to his Jewish brethren that make
[1:40:48] up the 144,000 typed in Benjamin. Yeah.
[1:40:52] When the Lord comes, see, when the Lord
[1:40:56] comes in his appearing, the mystery of
[1:41:00] God is revealed to the world.
[1:41:03] Amen.
[1:41:03] Now, we're not talking about his coming.
[1:41:05] That's secret.
[1:41:07] They don't even see that happening. They
[1:41:09] don't even know it happens.
[1:41:11] They're going to miss his coming
[1:41:12] completely. They because he doesn't come
[1:41:15] to the earth. The bride lifts up off the
[1:41:17] earth and meets him in another
[1:41:18] dimension. The world's unaware of it. Oh
[1:41:20] my. You understand friends? So how is
[1:41:23] the world then going to be? How can God
[1:41:25] justifiably judge them if he hasn't
[1:41:27] first appeared before he comes?
[1:41:30] He's appeared in you and me. He's
[1:41:31] appeared in his word and a bride who's
[1:41:34] ate the word and now has become the
[1:41:36] word.
[1:41:38] Amen.
[1:41:41] So the man of sin is revealed. See? And
[1:41:45] so when we look at that, we see that
[1:41:48] that God now his final will and
[1:41:52] testament have been made known to the
[1:41:55] earth. I'm going to close this so I
[1:41:56] don't just keep keep going on and on. So
[1:42:00] the one of the beautiful things
[1:42:04] that the bride was prophesied to have at
[1:42:08] the end time was a return of the
[1:42:10] ministry of the morning star.
[1:42:12] Amen.
[1:42:13] Amen. until the day dawn and the day
[1:42:16] star rise in your hearts. So church,
[1:42:18] just have faith. Keep going on age to
[1:42:21] age after age. You're going to die.
[1:42:22] You're going to be martyed. You're going
[1:42:23] to go down. Don't worry. There's a name.
[1:42:25] Your name's on a roll. It can't be
[1:42:27] removed. You're going to sleep and sleep
[1:42:28] and sleep through seven ages until the
[1:42:30] midnight hour.
[1:42:31] And at the midnight hour, the midnight
[1:42:33] cry will go forth. Behold, the
[1:42:34] bridegroom cometh. The message of the
[1:42:36] hour goes forward. The bridegroom
[1:42:39] cometh. Go out to meet him. and five
[1:42:41] wise and five foolish rose and five wise
[1:42:44] went in with him and five foolish were
[1:42:45] left behind for the tribulation. Good
[1:42:48] people, sanctified people, uh save from
[1:42:50] destruction. They'll be in heaven.
[1:42:51] They'll miss the millennium, but they'll
[1:42:53] be in heaven.
[1:42:54] Amen.
[1:42:54] And so, so we they're granted eternal
[1:42:56] life. So, so when we look at that, the
[1:42:58] ministry of the morning star. Now, this
[1:42:59] is this is interesting.
[1:43:02] And and brother Brandham showed us that
[1:43:06] why, you know, when we say, well, why
[1:43:08] does the Bible say at the evening time
[1:43:10] it shall be light? Because the morning
[1:43:13] star and the evening star are the same
[1:43:15] star.
[1:43:16] Amen.
[1:43:17] The morning star is seen in the east,
[1:43:20] but by the time it gets into the western
[1:43:22] hemisphere, then it's a then it's a star
[1:43:25] that becomes luminous again in the
[1:43:27] darkness just before the sun comes back
[1:43:29] up. Amen.
[1:43:30] So the so the morning star that started
[1:43:32] in Isuza, I'm sorry, that started in in
[1:43:35] the upper room. Amen.
[1:43:37] When the word was on display, when the
[1:43:39] ministry of the son of man went from one
[1:43:41] man Jesus into 120 Jesus's
[1:43:44] and then it went from there to 3,000 and
[1:43:46] then it went from there to more
[1:43:47] thousands and the church began to grow.
[1:43:50] So the ministry of the morning star ran
[1:43:51] perfectly until the church fell away.
[1:43:54] And so he promised at the evening time,
[1:43:56] at the end of seven ages, the morning
[1:43:59] star would reappear and it would be the
[1:44:02] ministry of the token, the ministry of
[1:44:04] the full word. That's that's ready again
[1:44:07] to be made flesh. Say, just like it was
[1:44:09] in the upper room, just like it was in
[1:44:11] Jesus, just like it was in the upper
[1:44:13] room, just like it was in the church.
[1:44:14] Now restored back. Why? Because this is
[1:44:17] the final voice to the final age before
[1:44:20] the man of sin can be revealed and Satan
[1:44:22] can mount his pale horse. Amen.
[1:44:26] Amen.
[1:44:28] Now, what is unique
[1:44:32] is that the morning and the evening star
[1:44:35] are just Venus.
[1:44:38] The morning star and the evening star
[1:44:39] are just historical names attributed.
[1:44:41] It's Venus.
[1:44:43] Amen.
[1:44:43] And and so now we'll just give you some
[1:44:46] facts about this. And I I wish I had
[1:44:47] brother Doug Baker here to break it all
[1:44:49] down for us. But but the reason that
[1:44:53] Venus
[1:44:55] is so bright in the sky is because it is
[1:45:00] enveloped entirely completely enveloped
[1:45:03] in a cloud.
[1:45:05] Amen.
[1:45:06] And the the upper deck of the cloud is
[1:45:10] so in one mind and one accord. And
[1:45:13] there's such unity in the surface that
[1:45:15] it just beams back the sunlight to the
[1:45:17] earth.
[1:45:18] Hallelujah.
[1:45:20] And what's here's here's another fact.
[1:45:23] It's all about there's intrinsic light
[1:45:25] and then there's apparent light. And I
[1:45:26] don't want to get into the science of
[1:45:28] it, although I could, but but intrinsic
[1:45:30] light is the light that it actually has.
[1:45:33] But apparent light is the light you
[1:45:34] would see if you were further away than
[1:45:36] the Earth. Let's say you were on the
[1:45:37] planets of the outer realm. Let's say
[1:45:40] you're in Mars. If you're standing on
[1:45:41] Mars, Venus isn't going to look as
[1:45:42] bright to you.
[1:45:44] If you're going on out all the way out
[1:45:46] to Pluto and Neptune, if you're going
[1:45:47] all the way out there, then you probably
[1:45:49] wouldn't even see it at all. As bright
[1:45:52] as it is, you wouldn't see it at all
[1:45:54] because light spreads out. And then they
[1:45:55] have a they have a formula for that. Uh
[1:45:58] because every time every time the
[1:46:00] dispersion doubles, uh there's a square
[1:46:02] law that says light is quartered. So
[1:46:05] every time it goes further and spreads
[1:46:07] further and it doubles, then the light
[1:46:08] the visible light. So that's your
[1:46:10] apparent light. It doesn't that the
[1:46:12] intrinsic light never changed.
[1:46:15] It doesn't matter that the world can't
[1:46:17] see this message. We see it.
[1:46:19] The only reason they don't see it is
[1:46:21] they're too far away.
[1:46:23] And the further away you are, and I'm
[1:46:25] here to tell you today, the further away
[1:46:27] you get from Christ and his word, the
[1:46:29] less it will shine to you. But there is
[1:46:32] a cloud of witnesses that surrounds the
[1:46:34] morning star and it declares the sun is
[1:46:37] coming. Amen.
[1:46:39] Hallelujah, friends.
[1:46:41] Oh, and then when you realize then
[1:46:43] you've got an upper deck.
[1:46:45] And then then now don't think of down
[1:46:48] because just think of out. So the very
[1:46:50] first thing you're going to get is the
[1:46:53] upper deck of clouds which are all in
[1:46:55] one mind and one accord.
[1:46:56] And there's no area where other other
[1:47:00] planets have cloud cover but it's not
[1:47:02] complete. Venus is complete. in fact is
[1:47:06] that that that Venus, the rocky planet,
[1:47:10] is is unseeable
[1:47:14] by the human eye.
[1:47:15] Amen.
[1:47:16] It's even unseeable if you have a
[1:47:18] telescope. All you see is a bright thing
[1:47:20] in the in the heavens. Why? Because no
[1:47:22] man have seen Venus at any time, but the
[1:47:25] cloud of witnesses declare it.
[1:47:28] No man have seen God, but there's a
[1:47:30] witness. There's a living people.
[1:47:33] Hallelujah. And the further they are
[1:47:34] away from it, the dimmer it gets. And
[1:47:36] they don't see anything. But to you,
[1:47:38] it's everything.
[1:47:44] And then and then I I in my study I
[1:47:46] found out that that even the cloud has a
[1:47:50] uh and and Chad actually called it
[1:47:54] agreed with me. I said, "It sounds like
[1:47:55] after he explained it and I double
[1:47:57] checked all the references with NASA
[1:48:00] that I said it sounds like there's a
[1:48:02] hierarchical order that you've got the
[1:48:04] upper deck, but then as you penetrate
[1:48:07] getting closer to the core that the the
[1:48:10] composition changes." And it said, "Oh
[1:48:12] yes, that's exactly right. You're spot
[1:48:14] on." And every chat agreed that's
[1:48:16] exactly right. And the reason for that
[1:48:17] is is because the world only sees the
[1:48:19] outer shell. They only see the upper
[1:48:21] deck. They only see the people. Amen.
[1:48:24] That you and I, the brothers and
[1:48:25] sisters,
[1:48:26] but down inside once you go, once you
[1:48:28] start penetrating, then the pressures
[1:48:31] become so great and the temperatures
[1:48:34] become so hot. It takes special clouds
[1:48:36] to be that close to the surface. I'm so
[1:48:39] glad God has apostles, prophets,
[1:48:41] pastors, teachers, and evangelists. Why?
[1:48:43] Because they're more than just the upper
[1:48:45] deck. They're down in there. And the
[1:48:47] closer you get, the worse your
[1:48:48] visibility becomes. Hallelujah. Because
[1:48:52] all you're seeing now is the reflected
[1:48:54] light of the sun.
[1:48:55] Amen.
[1:48:56] And in fact, I found out that no man has
[1:49:00] seen Venus at any time. All they can do
[1:49:05] all they can do is shoot it with radar
[1:49:09] from the Earth. And I have all the data
[1:49:10] from NASA where they've done that.
[1:49:13] But from an Earth view of the radar,
[1:49:17] they only get a low to medium grade
[1:49:19] resolution of the outline. It's some
[1:49:21] idea. See, because Bible students can
[1:49:24] probe at it
[1:49:26] and they can compare verse with verse
[1:49:28] and students can compare verse with
[1:49:30] verse and they can get a general sense
[1:49:32] of the word of God and some of the
[1:49:34] things but but it's not actually they're
[1:49:35] not actually seeing the full image. And
[1:49:38] so, you know, the only way they can
[1:49:40] actually see it, they have to put an
[1:49:41] infrared camera on a spaceship and they
[1:49:44] have to fly it over the planet. And then
[1:49:46] that thing can see down because it takes
[1:49:48] an astronaut. And it took a spiritual
[1:49:51] astronaut in our day that could see all
[1:49:53] the way to the core and say, "I know it
[1:49:55] just looks like people who are gathered
[1:49:57] and they're all crazy, but there's a
[1:49:59] there's an element at the center of this
[1:50:01] thing
[1:50:02] and it declares no man has seen God at
[1:50:05] any time, but the only begotten hath
[1:50:07] declared him."
[1:50:09] You and I, friends, we are that
[1:50:11] declaration today. You're you are the
[1:50:14] ministry of the morning star. You to the
[1:50:16] world. the world sees God through you or
[1:50:19] not.
[1:50:21] This is why Satan is afraid of you.
[1:50:25] This is why that he knows. He knows. A
[1:50:28] lot of times we don't seem to know it
[1:50:30] very good,
[1:50:31] but he knows that if the bride ever gets
[1:50:33] a real revelation of who she is
[1:50:37] in Christ under her messenger and that
[1:50:40] she can catch that revelation and catch
[1:50:42] that vision that the rest of the world
[1:50:44] can't see because we had a we had a
[1:50:47] spiritual astronaut who was able to to
[1:50:49] to to look down and peer in. And now we
[1:50:52] have a complete the complete revelation
[1:50:56] of the core of creation. And that's God
[1:50:59] himself.
[1:51:00] Amen.
[1:51:01] Why? Because that word became a man. And
[1:51:04] that man became a spirit. And that
[1:51:06] spirit lives in the church.
[1:51:08] Hallelujah. And that God has a plan. And
[1:51:11] I'm in it. And you're in it. And oh, I'm
[1:51:13] here to tell you friends, we're not
[1:51:14] going to need a spaceship. And I'm going
[1:51:16] to pass Venus so fast it'll leave it
[1:51:18] sitting still. I'm going to a world
[1:51:20] that's never been seen before.
[1:51:23] Oh, let's stand before I keep going.
[1:51:26] Listen, friends, that's exactly why I
[1:51:28] keep saying to you, you are you are a
[1:51:31] modern event
[1:51:32] made clear in prophecy.
[1:51:36] Amen.
[1:51:37] Hallelujah.
[1:51:39] Oh, so much more that I wanted to say.
[1:51:42] We'll stop right there today. It's
[1:51:43] almost straight up 1:00.
[1:51:46] You love the Lord.
[1:51:47] Amen. You love the Lord.
[1:51:50] You believe the word.
[1:51:52] Amen.
[1:51:52] You want to say today, Lord, let that
[1:51:54] word live in me.
[1:51:55] Amen.
[1:51:56] Hallelujah. Can we sing uh that song,
[1:51:59] let your word be born in the manger of
[1:52:02] my heart. Let it live in me. Let it
[1:52:04] start. You know that, Anthony. Amen.
[1:52:07] Praise the Lord. That's what I desire,
[1:52:09] friends. I I'm here to tell you, for me,
[1:52:12] no part of life matters after that. I
[1:52:15] just want to be perfectly in his will. I
[1:52:18] want to know that my life is reflecting
[1:52:22] the is reflecting the presence of the
[1:52:24] sun. I want to know that my ministry,
[1:52:27] this whole ministry team here, we we
[1:52:31] noon and night feed on the word of God
[1:52:33] to feed it to you. We live our lives
[1:52:36] separate and we constantly stay in
[1:52:37] prayer because I know that there's not
[1:52:39] just surface atmosphere. as you getting
[1:52:42] as you're getting closer, God has that
[1:52:44] hierarchical order that maybe can stand
[1:52:46] a little more pressure than you can
[1:52:48] because they're gifted and called by God
[1:52:50] to stand that. See, you and that's why
[1:52:52] somebody who's never called to that
[1:52:54] office of ministry should never try cuz
[1:52:57] the Bible calls them uh fires that he he
[1:53:01] his his spirit are like fire is like
[1:53:03] fire and he calleth his angels
[1:53:06] ministering spirits. See, so so we
[1:53:09] realize that God has equipped us. You
[1:53:12] you understand now why that there's such
[1:53:15] a limited value. Even though it's better
[1:53:18] than anything the world has, but you're
[1:53:21] not the world. And if you just stay home
[1:53:24] and play tapes and that's all you ever
[1:53:26] do, there's benefit in that, but it's
[1:53:28] going to be greatly limited because the
[1:53:29] day is too dark. It's too evil.
[1:53:31] And we need to come together. We need to
[1:53:33] rub shoulders. We need to open the word
[1:53:35] together. We need to rejoice together.
[1:53:37] Amen.
[1:53:37] Amen.
[1:53:39] You need that that order that God has.
[1:53:41] Your job today is to be that upper deck.
[1:53:44] Say, "Lord, I want to be the upper deck
[1:53:48] of the morning star. I want my life."
[1:53:51] Come on. How many of you How many would
[1:53:53] say, "I want to be that upper deck. I
[1:53:54] want my life." Wow. Let me put my glass
[1:53:57] on. It looks like some persons aren't
[1:53:58] even raising their hands. Would you like
[1:54:00] to be the divisible display of God or
[1:54:03] not? If you would, you just leave your
[1:54:04] hands down. But I want to be the visible
[1:54:07] display of Almighty God. That's what I
[1:54:10] desire in my life. To me, nothing else
[1:54:13] matters after that. I've got to have
[1:54:15] that or perish.
[1:54:17] For me, that's the only thing that makes
[1:54:19] life worth a living. Let's bow our
[1:54:21] heads.
[1:54:27] Thank you, Lord,
[1:54:31] for the word today.
[1:54:33] Thank you for giving me the clarity of
[1:54:35] thought because
[1:54:37] looking at it all, trying to cipher it
[1:54:39] down, trying to whittle it down to a
[1:54:42] preachable sermon today has not been
[1:54:44] easy.
[1:54:46] And Father, I I thank you that you made
[1:54:49] it possible and that you blessed it. And
[1:54:51] you've said what you wanted to say. And
[1:54:53] as I stand here, as I live and breathe
[1:54:55] now, I feel like I've said everything
[1:54:57] that you wanted said. Now I leave it to
[1:55:00] you. I give it into the hands of the
[1:55:02] Holy Spirit. Lord, I I'm glad that the
[1:55:05] people have a desire. You saw the hands
[1:55:08] everywhere that say, "Lord, I want to be
[1:55:11] that visible image of the approaching
[1:55:14] son. I want the world to see that he's
[1:55:16] coming soon by being able to view my
[1:55:19] life." The world who maybe has never
[1:55:22] known God, think they know him and they
[1:55:23] only know him by a man-made system. Good
[1:55:26] people. Many of them. Millions of them.
[1:55:29] Good people. Good people who who would
[1:55:32] love you if they if they could just see
[1:55:34] you clearly. I pray today you reveal
[1:55:36] yourself, Lord. Reveal yourself. No man
[1:55:39] can see you. No man can force you to do
[1:55:41] it. But I pray that you reveal yourself
[1:55:45] to each and every individual here today
[1:55:47] in the building, out across the
[1:55:49] airwaves, live stream, archive, whatever
[1:55:51] by way it comes, Lord. And let us who
[1:55:54] are here today and we who are alive and
[1:55:56] remain we intend to remain in your word
[1:55:59] until you call us. I intend Lord to keep
[1:56:02] preaching and to keep striving and keep
[1:56:04] pressing toward that mark. That great
[1:56:06] prize, that high calling. Oh, it's a
[1:56:09] great prize Lord. What a trophy at the
[1:56:12] end to know I made it. I stayed the
[1:56:14] course. Got weary. Got hot. It was not
[1:56:17] easy.
[1:56:19] But I kept going. I kept putting one
[1:56:22] foot in front of another. I kept
[1:56:23] believing. I kept confessing. One of
[1:56:26] these days, it's going to be so worth
[1:56:27] it. Lord, as you said, as you as I've
[1:56:30] said many times on the the image I saw
[1:56:33] of you years ago,
[1:56:35] gesturing out from the image, you said,
[1:56:37] "I never promised you it would be easy,
[1:56:39] only that it would be worth it."
[1:56:41] Amen.
[1:56:42] Lord, how worth it it's going to be that
[1:56:44] day. I ask for your divine mercy on us
[1:56:46] all today, one and all, young and old,
[1:56:48] male and female, out across everywhere.
[1:56:52] May they gain strength, Lord, from what
[1:56:54] was heard today, what has been heard in
[1:56:56] the past, and what will be heard coming
[1:56:57] going forward.
[1:56:59] I commit it to you now. Let the Holy
[1:57:01] Spirit do his work. Everything that
[1:57:04] needed to be said has been said. And so
[1:57:07] I bow my head and I close out my sermon
[1:57:10] and we give it to you now. We'll sing.
[1:57:12] We'll worship. Let the Holy Spirit do
[1:57:15] that thing that he does so well in
[1:57:17] Jesus' name. Amen. Let's sing it. We
[1:57:20] know this song. Let's sing it with
[1:57:21] brother Tony.
[1:57:22] Let your word
[1:57:25] be born
[1:57:27] in the m of my heart.
[1:57:32] Let it live me.
[1:57:36] Let it all
[1:57:40] live inside the house of grace
[1:57:45] and mold it every day.
[1:57:50] Let your word be born
[1:57:54] in the
[1:57:56] Oh my
[1:57:58] heart.
[1:57:59] Sing that again. Let your word be born.
[1:58:02] Let your word
[1:58:04] your word be born
[1:58:07] in the manger of my heart.
[1:58:12] There
[1:58:16] is song
[1:58:19] live inside
[1:58:22] my desire
[1:58:24] and mold it every day.
[1:58:29] Let your word be
[1:58:33] in the
[1:58:35] one more time. That's so beautiful.
[1:58:38] All together. Come on believers. Let
[1:58:41] your word
[1:58:44] be born
[1:58:46] in the manger of my heart.
[1:58:54] Let it fall.
[1:58:59] t
[1:59:01] of clay.
[1:59:08] There's a worthy.
[1:59:12] Give me the verse, brother Mark. Well,
[1:59:14] outwardly I'm nothing.
[1:59:17] Oh, that's okay. Right here.
[1:59:20] Well, outwardly I'm nothing.
[1:59:25] Not much to behold.
[1:59:29] hardly a place
[1:59:33] for his word to unfold.
[1:59:39] Yield this vessel
[1:59:42] and let him have his way
[1:59:46] from glory unto glory. Hallelujah. He'll
[1:59:51] change me by day.
[1:59:55] Let your word
[1:59:59] be born
[2:00:01] in the manger of my heart.
[2:00:06] Let
[2:00:08] me
[2:00:09] let
[2:00:14] inside this house of flame
[2:00:18] and mold it every day.
[2:00:23] Let your word be
[2:00:26] in a rain.
[2:00:31] The chorus one more time.
[2:00:35] Word
[2:00:37] before
[2:00:39] in the manger of my heart.
[2:00:43] Oh, let
[2:00:46] me
[2:00:50] live inside.
[2:00:53] [Music]
