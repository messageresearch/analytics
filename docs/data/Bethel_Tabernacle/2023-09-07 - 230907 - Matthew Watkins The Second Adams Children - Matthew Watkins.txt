control oh yes Lord I [Music] feel amen glad that you feel that pool amen down inside of your heart amen God bless you if you have your Bible turn to the book of 1 Corinthians chapter 15 and also John 14 we'll read those and then have you be seated amen 1 Corinthians chapter 15 amen we just are certainly glad to be here Amen in the house of the Lord tonight and we uh we had such a wonderful time uh away there for about 12 days in Israel and haven't really had a time to really give a chance to give some of the testimony from that but the Lord all I can say is is that uh brother Jason dears is the best trip planner uh it's ever lived on on planet Earth um but let me just say this Jason Amar as good as he is couldn't have put that trip together God really um God really blessed it in a really special way and so we'll Lord willing maybe in the future give a chance to be able to share some things the Lord did for us while we were over there we seen his hand of Mercy protect prot in US saving our lives and keeping us from harm and uh and also just blessing us with his presence just had such a special time had to have got got a chance to have communion little communion service in the garden uh or in the garden tomb there uh where the tomb W that Jesus was put in just right outside of that where golgatha is so it was just a really special time took a trip uh took a boat right on the Sea of Galilee sounds really unbelievable and it really was so I would just say if you ever have the chance to go go it's uh really just a blessing 1 Corinthians chapter 15 I said that because I'm going to make just some comments about some things that we' seen there that just tie in with a sermon here tonight that we have I'm going to be preaching to you on the second Adam's children 1 Corinthians chap 15: 45 and so it is written the first man Adam was made a living Soul the last Adam was made made a quickening spirit let's read that one more time the first man Adam was made a living Soul the last Adam was made a quickening spirit John chapter 14 if you just want to turn over one more place and we'll have you be seated John chapter 14 we're just going to read a few verses here real famous scripture for the bride I believe it should be a Paramount uh scripture that we remember by heart just pertain aains to us I believe notice this here and we're just going to begin reading we'll read a few verses here let's just start reading at verse 10 believest thou not that I am in the father and the father in me the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth The Works believe me that I am in the father and the father in me or else believe me for the very Works sake in other words even if you don't uh can't make sense of what I'm saying look what I'm doing they testify to you of who I am a lot of times you you you judge something because you know that the fruits of God are being made manifest in it you don't question it you just say Lord I know that this has got to be you because the works that I see are a fulfillment of the Bible right and so he says believe me he says verily I say he that believeth on me this is verse 12 here verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on on me the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than these shall he do because I go to my father and whatsoever you shall ask in my name that will I do how many believers do we have of that here tonight that the notice he says and whatsoever you shall ask notice brother Brandon points out here the prophet of God says not what he would ask not what brother uh Ru would ask not what brother cop not what brother Brandon would ask not what brother Jason would ask whatsoever you ask you got to put your name there how many can put their name there and say I'm going to put my name right in the Bible and say whatsoever you ask notice it again in verse 13 and whatsoever you ask in my name that will I do that the father may be glorified in the son if you shall ask anything in my name I will do it what a promise we have let's just bow our heads here is maybe you'd have a need something upon your heart I want you just to be sensitive to the Holy Spirit now with your head bowed and eyes closed you know sometimes you can we can focus on things on a Wednesday night I'm guilty of it and we can we can become more of a hindrance because our minds going in a million miles uh on the wrong thing so I want you just to raise a hand and say Lord let me just be a vessel of Faith right now let me be a a vessel let me get my mind and my spirit in tune with the harmony of the word of God so that I could be a be an create an atmosphere of Faith where the word could go forth and could find its place Lord Jesus you see my hand Lord is up with all of your children Lord that's here gathered those that are here Lord by father under the sound of my voice those that are online streaming Lord tonight we just ask for your help Lord God I've waited on you Lord I believe that you've put this upon My Heart Lord you spoke to me Lord in such a personal way I know Lord that this is a message that you want to minister tonight to your children now God it wouldn't do any good for me to prepare for those that have prepared the music and the singing and the sound and Lord even those that have came and gathered it would just do us no good Lord it would not benefit us in any way if you didn't come and show up Lord so we ask Lord God as we've sang this song come and take control that's our prayer Lord Jesus may you take control of the speaker the hearer Lord you can your word is Anointed but I'm asking you Lord anoint me as the speaker and I believe Lord there's children that are here today that have rais their hand and say anoint me as the hearer of your word let me hear the voice of God speak to my soul we ask it Lord God I pray that you would do it accomplish the purpose that you've created for this service here tonight on Wednesday we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen amen you can be seated we had such a good time and I I just uh won't take any much time to really um go over it and I don't there it is right there if you could go ahead and display that power you got it already up thank you we had such a wonderful time uh there in Israel and it was uh incredible to me so many things I could name uh to you and could give you reasons why it was incredible as we did um uh just going to turn these up brother B that's okay if it gets too loud then you can you can uh get mad at me later but I got to hear myself um we had seen so many incredible things there in Israel and uh I could give you a list as I said of of things that we've seen but you know for just tonight's sermon here in context of what we're preaching on the second Adam's children I just thought it was so profound just the simple realization while we were there uh very simple realiz ation struck me that my whole life I've read the Bible I've preached uh even uh about the the the characters of The Bible and I've preached about the men of the Bible and and uh and and I've read the Bible and heard the Bible preach my whole life but now I'm standing in the land of the Bible and I'm I'm standing in the promised land the place that God had promised to Abraham and to Isaac and to Jacob and I'd always wanted to see many things in my life there's bucket list that everybody I'm sure would make of things you'd want to see if you ever had a chance to go there and so I had a list of many things that I was praying that the Lord would allow us to see while we were there and the Lord granted almost every single nearly everything that I had on my heart the Lord just granted that in a special way and we were able to see it one of those places that I wanted to see for years uh after watching a a man who had went over there and did a video on his trip was the Israeli Museum I'm not much of a museum guide I'm not against museums in any way but just not my my kind of thing normally uh maybe would consider it boring and couldn't read you know so much and but this was totally different you know when you're when you're studying a student of the Bible and you're reading about this then this isn't just a a book it's not just a good novel it's not just a good story it's the story of my life everything that I my entire life is connected to it in some way and so we got to go over there to this uh Israeli Museum if you ever get a chance I just believe every believer should go and see that museum if you're ever there it's just would just be a a great encouragement to you but one of those places in the museum was an exhibit they call the Shrine of the book and uh it's pictured here just in this image and and this is just the cap of that uh of that place um and and and it's it's called The Shrine of the book because of what's inside of it there's actually an underground section that you go into and if you do a little a little bit of study you'll find out this is where they keep uh what's called the Aleppo codex and if you're not into manuscript the original Hebrew Bible that's okay I wasn't either until I needed to study on it but the Aleppo codex was part of the what they call the mastic text which was the the manuscripts of where we get our Hebrew Bible the mastic text was written about a th000 ad and it was until they discovered the Dead Sea Scrolls uh it was it was the most furthest back they could date the the Hebrew Bible the Tanakh the the the Old Testament the Psalms and all of the the the Proverbs and all the prophets and so that Hebrew Bible is that that Aleppo codex they keep that there uh in the Shrine of the book and they've made a great uh great uh exhibit there that you can see and read all about it um and then they they um uh they also keep the Dead Sea Scrolls there which are we're not preaching on any of this tonight just wanted to bring a thought from a little context from it here in our sermon but the Dead Sea uh the Dead Sea Scrolls that they found also uh are there in the Shrine of the book and that Dead Sea Scrolls is another compilation of just ancient books and ancient texts and in fact ancient manuscripts more ancient than the altic the mastic text that actually when they found the Dead Sea Scrolls what they realized was is that what they had been relying upon for the manuscript for the Hebrew Bible from a th000 ad matched up to text they had now found from all the way in the 3r century BC about 300 years before Christ and so these texts was a great discovery when they found the Dead Sea Scrolls in the caves of kumran and cuman's right along the shores of the the Dead Sea and it's just a little village that the that they that they had there the ases had and they took the Bible and lived a very dedicated it was a sectarian group just like the Pharisees and Sadducees um but they they they discovered these the Dead Sea Scrolls and and within that they found the entire book of Isaiah the entire Isaiah scroll and it just and it was it was incredible because it matched perfectly the Aleppo codec and all the manuscripts from a thousand years later and just from the to line upon line the God's word has been preserved and protected you listen because this wasn't a book written by a man it was breathed by God and know that the the Dead Sea Scrolls uh were were were discovered there and found in a village and it's amazing when you go down in the The Shrine of the book and you begin to see some of that some of the exhibit they have there on the Aleppo codex and also the Dead Sea and I begin to read an inscription and it was so incredible is because these Dead Sea Scrolls were found in 1947 about 3 months before Israel becomes a nation three months before they're voted in the UN and Israel becomes a nation that there's a bed a ban Shepherd uh if you don't know the BET one's just a very H H uh indigenous group there that very um uh but anyways not I don't want to get sidetracked on that here tonight but these Benn Shepherds had had tried to find their goat and they had thrown a stone inside of a caved and heard something break some pottery break they go in to discover and these Shepherds found the Dead Sea Scrolls and here they find one of the greatest discoveries they didn't even know what they had when they found it they had no clue they just thought it was just another Hebrew text something ancient something that was old they actually they sold it to a man who just told him it was ancient text that man didn't really know what it was he sent it to uh New York City and they put it actually you can find a classified section in the in the uh the newspaper in New York City trying to sell these books and it just says Ancient Man ancient books uh old books come get your taste of the old life and little do they know it's the most ancient accurate manuscript you know friends sometimes you don't realize what you have in your hand until a the revelation of the prophet of God tells you what you have in your hand little David might just look like a stone but it's what's going to slay Goliath might not look like much but to the to th to that man it just could be solded on the street for nothing but it was the very breathed word of God on paper corre and so these bet when Shepherds sell it they finally find out years later and so they they discover this in in in 1947 and it was so incredible to me because uh they believe that the the Jews believe that this signified something that it wasn't just an accident that these Shepherds found these Scrolls but actually they believe that it fulfilled Isaiah chapter 2:3 and in Isaiah 2:3 and you don't have to turn I'm just going to read it it says and many people shall go and say Come Ye and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord to the house of God of to the god of Jacob and he will teach us his ways and we will walk in his paths notice for out of Zion shall go forth the law and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem so the Jews see the Dead Sea Scrolls and I absolutely do believe it wasn't an accident that three months before Israel becomes a and God is going to fulfill prophecy by taking people from the land the people of the land to bring them back to the land to take the land that right before God puts the people back in the Homeland he restores the word to the people my brother my sister I hope you're a Believer here tonight and catch the significance in 1947 we have the tape of God's Prophet saying they're getting some gadgets together for recording at the time God was restoring the word to Israel God was restoring in the word to a gentile bride I I say thank God for what you've did in this generation thank God that I'm a recipient of that word that was restored I don't just read about a book but I am the person of the book I am who the book is written about and I've receive the word of the book and it's my homeland it's my Promised Land Hallelujah can you say Amen do you believe that tonight and so the timing of God is just perfect let me say it this way we have returned to the land of Abraham Isaac and Jacob we have returned to the coming of the Lord it was it was the co it was the more than that let me say this more than that we have returned to the land of the Bible this Bible is your inheritance the song says every promise in the book is mine every chapter every verse and every line you say what part of it's yours brother Matt every part that God intended for to be applicable to me I say God I want all of it I don't want to I don't want to be withheld from any of it Lord but I want to be a recipient of all of it can you say Amen to the word of God and so it's a land that that that Paul defines the borders of this land let me say it this way it's our land it's our land it's your land young people tonight it's your promise it's your inheritance tonight whatsoever Jesus said you ask I shall do what does that mean it means that anything that you say and anything that you ask in my name anything that you ask according to my word you're the CH you're the child you're you're you're the second Adam's children and every promise in the book is yours Hallelujah and so the I I I thought of this this was so amazing while walking uh in the land of Israel it's one thing to have a land but it takes a people of the land it takes a person to dwell and inhabit listen God didn't just create that land to be a land flowing with milk and honey but he put put the land there for the people to possess that land he put that milk and honey for somebody to go and take part of it not just to say it's a land flowing with milk and honey but for somebody to say I'm going to take the milk and honey I'm going to take the sword of faith and take the sword of the word and I'm going to drive it and charge the enemy until I take what God has given me and take back what the devil has taken from me I'm going to take my inheritance because I'm a people of the land it's a land flowing with milk and honey as the brother said he said but it takes an eye of Faith to see it and it takes a hand of Faith to draw the honey from The Rock and so with the returning of go with with that returning God was going to return the word to them and so now after 2,000 years God has not just returned the book uh to the Jews but God has returned an open book to the Gentile church and God's people have heard their Jubilee the trumpet of Jubilee has already sounded if you're waiting for it I got news the Jubilee has already sounded you can go free you don't have to be bound from any cigarettes you don't have to be bound on any nicotine you don't have to be B bound to pornography you don't have to be bound to jealousy you don't have to be bound to anger or temper or Pride but the Jubilee has sounded and you can go free from anything the devil puts upon you oh I believe that God's people are free we ought to start living more like we're free and not bound uh listen friends we're not slaves to any denominational system we're not slaves to a teaching or a or a preaching or or an idea or a code or something but God's family is free in Christ Jesus she not slaves anymore she's free in the Lord Jesus and so notice this here uh he it's it was the returning of the book I just reading from my notes here just for a moment uh that they have that that that Jubilee has sounded and they were returning to the land of their inheritance something that God had promised them though it looked like it was impossible but God made a promise I'll bring you back to that land it didn't look like that when Hitler was and they were there in the Holocaust and millions of Jews were being slaughtered it didn't look like that God's word was was ever going to come to pass but in the right time in the right season under the right anointing in the right hour at the right moment nothing will stop God's word from coming to pass I said at the right moment at the right season no devil in hell can stop the word of God from coming to pass uh the Bible says the though the vision T be assured it will come to pass amen and so we're living how many believes that we're living could could you say Amen to this we're living in the end times could you say Amen to this that we are the people of the end times I'm asking can you say Amen so I'm just hoping that maybe you can if you don't say Amen maybe you can't so I'll ask again give you a second chance how many would say Amen to this we are living in the end times we are the people of the end times and so we've received an end time if there was an end time people there had to be an end time message if there was going to be an end time message there had to come an end time messenger and so there would be an end time message delivered by an end time profet I got a lot of hay on my Fork so I'm just going to go fast and I won't get to it and that's okay I'm not going to try to I heard brother Josh Bennett say this weekend I'm not a long-winded preacher it just depends on who you compare me to so don't compare me to anybody just except maybe brother Tim puit you compare me to brother Tim and I'm not that long of winded of a Preacher hope you don't hear that so we are living in the end time we're a people of the end time we've received an end time message and in fact there's an end time anointing that comes upon that message let me say this to you friends you don't have the anointing of the ox brother Ram was asking questions and answers 1964 will the bride go through the persecution as the first church did no brother the next thing for the church is the rapture and so there's not an ox anointing coming to give our lives you're not also not under the man anointing there was an anointing of men that God create Anointed The Mind the intellectual mind of man but let me just say that's not your anointing because that's not the spirit that fa you that's not the challenge of the day you say brother matth what is the challenge of the day the prophet of God said it was a p horse rider which was a mixture or a compilation of all of the horses of all of the Demons of all of the spirits I just heard brother Adam say it yesterday he said now more than ever before this the spirit of antichrist is more at work and it will continue to get worse and worse and worse until the Rapture of the Church of God had G so bad the Bible says says that if it wasn't for God cutting the cutting the time short even the elect wouldn't be saved but thank God I'm in God's hands thank God I'm in Jehovah's hands thank God I'm not in Putin's hands or Biden's hands or Trump's hands or a political party but my my life as David said is in the hands of God God says when my life is over no devil can take you brother brandham said until God is finished with you Satan can't even touch your life take that devil amen and so so so we've received that end time message with that end time anointing let me say my brother my sister it wasn't an anointing or a message just to give you mystery truths the mystery truths are wonderful but let me tell you who the mystery real mystery truth is you do you realize the real mystery was the manifestations of Sons and Daughters of God you have the mystery of the serpent SE we have the mystery of predestination The Mystery of the god had all of these Mysteries point to one thing that that Christ was the the as we know Christ was the mystery of God revealed so his bride would be the mystery of Christ revealed and so brother Bron ministers an entire series and he calls it Israel and the church how many have heard that how many have heard that Israel in the church and and it's a wonderful series he takes that series and title over and over actually again he takes that same sermon Israel in the church and what he's doing is is he's paralleling uh Israel and he says he's paralleling natural Israel to spiritual Israel now we haven't replaced Israel as replacement theolog theology would try to say that Israel you know spurn their chance and now the church the Gentile Church replaces them no no no but the Bible says that Israel's blindness was in part so that the Gentiles could come in so why was Israel blinded because you had to come to your season and your time recog recognize your day and its message because why brother Matt because your name was written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world before you ever came into existence my name was already written in a book that's why I had to hear the word that's why I had to recognize as his Eagle food that's why I can believe the message over the hour not because of anything that I'm better than anybody else but because my name was written in a book that's why the prophet says when you recognize this as Eagle's food you left the other thing and you heard from your theophany you say brother Matt you believe that you've heard from your theophany when you heard the message I do in fact I believe I hear from my theophany every time I read it every time I turn on a tape every time I hear the preaching of the word of God every time I'm in my prayer closet what am I doing I'm hearing from my representation in another dimension and I'm saying Amen to the word of God I feel like quitting but my theophany says don't quit you're not a quitter I feel like turning around but my theophany says you're not going to turn around you're going to make it all the way Hallelujah I feel like a failure sometimes that I miss God but my theophany says you're more than an overcomer in Christ Jesus Hallelujah so we're the children of Abraham and it parallels the natural seed Abraham with the Royal seed there's not just a natural there's a royal Seed of Abraham the children of Abraham are the faith the Royal seed are the faith seed brother Brandon would say by what brother Matt by the baptism of the Holy Ghost you become an heir of the promise of Abraham I'll say that again by the baptism of the Holy Ghost you become an heir of the same promise of the same land of the same blessing you realize what you have when you get the baptism of the Holy Ghost you take off this coat brother bam says listen it's not just a taking a Cod and putting another coat on a man and he says I'm afraid sometimes that's what religion is became we just take off an old coat and put on a new coat but the problem is is the man in the coat hasn't been changed I say what we need is not a new coat not a new dress code not a new idea we need new men in the coat we need Chang lives by the power of the preaching of the word of God and so he he the children of Abraham are the children of faith that Faith seed and so what God was going to do with natural Israel he was also going to do with spiritual Israel it's not an accident as we said that in 47 they find the Dead Sea Scrolls only three months before they become a nation and in the same year God's calling and starting to record by Magnetic Tape the voice of God through a Earthly Messenger to a to a to a people who could receive that message amen hallelujah so just as the figure fig tree what would would represent Israel Jesus says when you see the Fig Tree putting forth its bud you putting forth its Branch you know that the time is not so brother bam said what did that fig tree represent it represented Israel you don't represent the Fig Tree but the Fig Tree represents Israel but in also not just there isn't just a fig tree there's also a bride tree and that brid tree just as the Fig Tree would put forth a branch that brid tree would come through the Dark Ages through a Reformation through Luther through Wesley all the way through Pentecost all the way to where at the seed that fell in the ground becomes the seed at the end time and so so there there was a there was a there was a a a fig tree putting forth its Branch so the bride tree has borne a new Branch can you say Amen struggling on where to go here just pray for me just for a moment just want to uh want to make this want to make sure we turn the right corner and we don't go uh with the amount of time that we have here tonight uh 1 Peter chapter 3 if you have your Bible we'll just turn to the to 1 Peter chapter 3 quickly if you could if they can just keep my PowerPoint up rather than putting the scripture up that'd probably be better 1 Peter chapter 3 we're just going to read from verse 14 through Verse 18 and so notice this here uh 1 Peter chapter 3 but and you he says and if you suffer for righteousness sake happy are you and be not afraid of their Terror neither be troubled but sanctify the Lord God in your hearts now I want to tell you what the what this is really saying he's saying make the Lord make God the Lord in your heart amen let's read it again together but sanctify the Lord God in your heart in other words make him the Lord of your heart amen obey his voice come under the headship of the Lord this is what he's saying here in verse 15 sanctify the Lord God in your heart brother random says this here in the seventh seal he says I went to a man not long ago he come to me rather he'd been arguing all around everywhere against Divine Healing and he'd come up and he said I don't believe your Divine Healing I said my I guess it wouldn't be any good cuz I ain't got any I said ' but God is perfect he said there's no such a thing I said you're too late to say that buddy you done waited too long for that you might have argued a few years ago but there's another age on now there's Millions to testify see I said you're too late now fella to say that he said well he said he said well I don't believe I don't care what you do I said certainly not you can't now I want I want you to notice here because I'm just going to take just a turn here in 1 Peter chapter 3 and I'm going to pause that come back to the slide he says here in verse 15 keep reading in your Bible but sanctify the Lord God in your hearts and be ready always to give an answer to every man that askthe a reason of the hope that is with he says of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear having a good conscience that whereas they speak evil of you as as of evildoers they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good accuse your good conversation in Christ for it is better if the will of God be so then you that you suffer for well-doing than for evildoing I want to key in on this verse here because I just want to preach to you something the I'm preaching on second Adam's children but the Lord just so inspired this to my heart here in 1 Peter chapter 3 because you can almost get the idea from this verse 15 that this means that we've got to give an answer to every question forgive me just got clogged up here in my thr in my in my voice it may it would almost mean that come off to mean that we've got to give an answer to every question but let me just go ahead and cut to the chase you don't need to give an answer to every question this is not what First Peter chapter 3 is saying now this is what the modern Church thinks that you have to be ready to give an answer to any critic or any skeptic or any person that gives you an answer that you've got to argue with them and prove and defend the gospel now I'm all for defending the gospel but we don't defend the gospel by arguing the second Adam's children don't defend the gospel by arguing the gospel listen to what brother Bram says here he says he says he said well I don't believe you certainly not he says you can't see he said smite me blind if you got the Holy Ghost like Paul smite me blind I said how can I do it when you're already blind your father has blinded you to the truth and I said you're already blind and he said I wouldn't believe I don't care what you could do how much evidence you could prove or anything like that I still don't believe I said certainly it wasn't for unbelievers it was only for believers can we go a little further what was it you know right when they then the elections off notice what he says here see you know right then the elections off just don't fool with it at all Jesus did the same thing he said let them alone if the blind lead the blind won't they all fall in the ditch but when he come to a little prostitute it struck fire GL what was it brother bam says if Jesus said the blind lead the blind they all fall in the ditch but when it come to a little prostitute it struck fire what was it it was an elected seed laying down there that's seen it right now when it come to Peter there was an elected seed lay in there see and they saw it and all the father hath give notice past tense all the father hath already given past tense this is why brother randam says if you are God's child you always were God's child and he says then if you aren a Son of God you can never be a Son of God no matter how much you try you can never be one and he says because all that the father hath given me in other words brother bandam says if you are Gods you always were Gods you only bypassed your theophany and came to this world to be tested in tried but when you heard that word it struck fire down inside of your heart you didn't question it you didn't argue it you didn't debate it you didn't even need to put on a chalkboard but something inside of you said amen I believe that word I accept that word I hear that word something inside of me identifies with that word when it come to Peter there was an elected seed laying there and they saw it all the father hath given me hath come brother bandam says if you weren't Gods you never can be but if you were Gods you always will be and nothing can ever make you not a son or daughter of God oh Hallelujah is right I say thank God thank God that nothing I can do can ever separate me from being a son or daughter of God because I've done many things how many would be honest here and say I've done many things in my life that would have written me off and marked me off and disqualified me but the grace of God said I'm his and he is mine and nothing can separate me from the love that's in Christ Jesus Hallelujah Brother Band says though come to me oh my I love that yes sir notice the Believers does believe it the unbelievers can't believe it amen if anybody wants to argue about the serpent seed and things and you try to show them they won't listen to it just walk away amen how many Believers can say Amen to the word of God listen friends say Amen if you believe if you don't then I think that I get scared as brother brandham says they said oh you saying amen might make me scared brother Bram says if you not saying am man would make me scared when you don't amen the word I just assume you don't believe it I mean that when you don't amen the word I question do you believe it or not cuz a Believer believes the word and says Amen to the word word of God I heard a preacher sent it to the entire men's group here heard a preacher a uh a Missionary Baptist preacher did you get that brother Joe I don't know if you you heard that yeah Missionary Baptist preacher uh preaching on here's a man doesn't have any revelation of the word of God of the message of the hour and he's and and this man's up here preaching on the way of balum how many brothers raise your hand if you heard that raise your hand if you heard it if you didn't hear it I want to make sure I get it to you CU it's really good you go in the bethl men chat you'll get that video we sent out here's a man preaching his heart out against the way of Balon and against the modern Church Hillsong and and Steven fdick starts calling out names and bethl church and Jesus Revolution and asbe Revival and he's starting to show that it might look like the word it might look like the gospel it might sound like the gospel but it denies the power thereof and it's the way of balum and you know what I heard I heard the echoing voices thundering of hundreds of missionary baptist people saying Amen to the word of God I thought oh God help us if we've gotten to a place where when the preaching of the word of God comes God help us if we can't say amen I say we ought to give a hearty amen if you ever feel like standing up to your feet you ought to stand to your feet to say I support the word of God I'm identified with the word of God I'm not afraid to say Amen to the word of God you ought to support it it helps not me it helps the Holy Spirit brother bam said helps accumulate faith I want to accumulate faith brother bam says if they won't listen notice this then just walk away leave them alone see God don't argue neither does his children amen amen so there's this this thinking listen I'm just going to preach here just for a moment I'm already preaching but I I got to say that cuz what I'm about to say we don't need to research this messag amen amen amen you don't need to why would you research it you to vindicate it it's already been Vindicated we're not looking for more Vindication it's already been Vindicated no more than I don't need to read y brother Matt you better be careful listen friends I I will be careful I don't need to research this Bible I don't need to research the message the same reason I don't need to research the Bible why it's already been Vindicated amen you don't need to answer the questions of unbelievers why brother Matt because it's unbelievers questions let me just say this and make this real simple those are unbelievers questions those aren't your questions that's right amen they're not our questions so don't try to answer them of unbelievers because why brother Matt they're not asked from a position of Revelation they're asked from a position of skepticism and unbelief amen and the same spirit that anoints the defectors of the message to try to get you to tangle with him and questions is the Same Spirit on Charles Darwin it's the same Spirit on on the atheist movement that tries to get you to get down into the into the text and try to bring you down into an intellectual level listen friends our battle is not with flesh and blood it's with principalities and powers and wickedness and evil places and the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal but they're spiritual to the pulling down of stronghold we don't wrestle Flesh and Blood I don't need to answer the questions of atheists because they're not my questions and I don't need to answer the me the the the the doubters of the detractors and defectors of the message of the hour and try to make brother brandham say that he was dishonest say that he was a liar say that he was a false prophet don't you realize they said that about every true prophet of God in fact they went worse than that and cut their heads off hung them on upside down on crosses they hated Jesus Jesus said if they hate listen friends I'd be more scared if the whole world accepted what we preach I said I'd be worried about what we're preaching if our the entire world and masses came in here and filled up our churches without any transformed life if if our people can sit here with cut hair makeup earrings pants on women shorts on men and and if you can sit and come to bethl Tabernacle for month after month after month then I've got to ask what is h what's wrong as people just doing this when when when the preaching of the word of God is preached it's a perversion of scripture let me just say this it's a perversion of scripture in First Peter chapter 3 to say we have to have an answer to every man that ask that is not what first Peter 3 is saying but it's been hijacked by the modern church with a modern agenda and it's been used as the gateway to apostasy now that was straight from the Holy Spirit and I just wrote it down I'm going to tell you say brother mat then what does it mean to give an answer to every man about the hope that layeth within him doesn't the Bible say study to show yourself approved a Workman who needeth not be ashamed I I absolutely believed in studying the word of God I believe in rightly dividing the word of God I believe in being able to tell somebody about what I believe I believe in studying the message but let me just say it again it's a perversion to say that first Peter 3 is saying that we've got to give an answer to every question to the skeptic you are wasting your time and I would be wasting my time and their time to debate them you say why brother Matt because that's not what the Bible teaches and listen let me go a little bit further here and we're just going to take a take a pause from that listen to what brother brandham says here and he says oh and he says he says the prophet Paul said in the last day people would be headyy oh my goodness how many could say we've seen that high-m minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God truce Breakers false accusers incontinent that means they have no self control despisers of those that are good he High minded see having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such debate from such sit down in a Facebook interview and argue with them sit down in a podcast with them and argue is that what your Bible says I ain't preaching against anybody or anything so don't even get that in your mind but the Bible says from such turn away for this is the kind that goes from house to house and leads silly women LED away with diverse lust with shorts bobbed hair and everything else LED away with diverse lust and saying it's all right oh they're crazy out there don't pay no attention see never able to come to the knowledge of the truth and these men resisted as Janice and Jam's with stood Moses able to produce a church able to produce a group of people but their Folly will be made manifest I know when it's going to be brother Matt when I argue with him and I can prove them make them look dumb no they'll end up making you look dumb because that's not your anointing and listen Eve when you get out from behind the word you get out from behind your headship and when you get out from behind your headship you remove yourself from your protection their Folly will be made known listen what brother bom says here make sure I didn't I didn't skip it when the church allowed herself to move away from the original like Adam and Eve death said in there's no strength in her she has become a monstrosity the minute the church moved toward form and ceremony and priesthood by organizing the ministers into a group that decided leadership apart from the Holy Spirit and his word that very moment death entered and she started to get sick now he's preaching to you on the modern church and she started to get sick and as she got sick she changed to a powerless group of people whose only weapon was argument wow amen she could produce nothing in the spirit for her hopes were built on program and not on faith in his word they sowed program so they reaped program they sowed perversion so they reaped perverted children I say whatever you sow you shall also reap you say brother matth what ought we to sow we ought to sow faith we ought to sow hope we ought to sow the word we ought to sow the message of the hour into the lives of our children and we'll reap the Harvest amen amen whatever we sow that we will also reap can you say amen and so you don't answer a skeptic's question this is this is let me give you the biblical examples of giving an answer to every man acts chapter 4 I'm going to give you one example verse 14 turn in your Bible if you have your Bible use it tonight please just for me can you do that I give you permission to use those smartphones also acts 14 acts 4 verse 14 be ready to give him an answer to every man who asks about the reason of the hope that lays within you and behold the man verse 14 which was healed standing with them notice they could say nothing against it I'm gonna tell you what any Defector or doubter of God's Prophet can't do they can preach against him they could teach against him teach against his character teach against the stories but they can say nothing against the miraculous Miracles that took place and healings that took place in his meetings they could say nothing against it that's right but when they had commanded them to go aside of the council they conferred among themselves saying what shall we do to these men for that indeed a notable Miracle hath been done by them is Manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem and we cannot deny it but that it spread no further among the people let it straightly threaten them that they speak henceforth to no man in this name and they called them and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus but Peter and John answered and said unto them I love this answer they're about to give an answer about the hope that lays within them whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you uh more than unto God judge you in other words you can answer that question for we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard so when they had further threatened them they let them go finding nothing how they might punish them because of the people for all men glorified God for that which was done for the man listen all the people glorified God when you glorify God it's not something new that didn't start in the 20th century that didn't start in 1906 glorifying God went all the way back to the mind of God when the sons of God shouted for joy and leapt in the spirit of God I say we ought to glorify God more amen all the people glorified God I'd Lov to been there to see how they glorified god notice he says and they glorified God and they he and he says they lifted up their voices verse 24 I'm sorry missed my place here uh he said verse 22 thank you for the man was above 42 years 40 years old on whom this miracle of healing was showed and being let go they went to their own company and reported all that the chief priests and Elders had said unto them and when they heard that they lifted up their voice to God with one Accord it's a powerful thing when we lift up our voices to God and said Lord Thou Art God thou has made Heaven and Earth and the Sea and all that in them is who by the mouth of thy servant David hath said when did the Heathen rage and the people imagine vain thing the kings of the earth stood up and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord and against his Christ for of a truth against thy holy Child Jesus whom thou has anointed both Herod and pontis pilate with the Gentiles and the people of Israel gathered together for to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done and now Lord behold their threatenings and Grant unto thy servants that with all boldness they may argue fight fuss picker what was the boldness going to be for to speak the word oh ain't that what the Bible says you should go how do you how do you convince the gainsayer preach the word of God and I say more than that live the word of God live out a testimony show the world what Jesus can do in 2023 show them that he's still alive speak the word he says give us boldness by stretching forth thine hand to heal and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy Child Jesus and when they had prayed the place was shaken where they were assembled together and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and they spoke the word of God with boldness the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one Soul neither said any of them that all of the things which he POS possessed was his own but they had all things common and with great power gave the apostles witness and with great power I say more than ever before we need what the Bible speaking of here to back up our lives and with great power he gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus and great grace was upon them all amen L I could read you acts we don't have the time I'm already out of time and I haven't even got started I could give you Acts 2 Acts 3 acts 4 8-2 acts 5 29-32 scriptures I had written down here what you would find is none of those examples in the Bible you will never find a place in the Bible where the apostles after they were endued with power from the holy Holy Ghost you will never show an example of Peter or John trying to be Scholars you will never show them find them trying to be Scholars to go to school and to argue intellectual arguments with these carnal men who were questioning what they believed who were accusing and and bringing accusations against Jesus against the Church of God you'll never find them and arguments theological arguments are going on a chalkboard and drawing out their theology you say did they did they believe in the godhead absolutely they had a revelation of it they believe in predestination you better believe it the original church had the true revelation of the godhead of who Jesus was of who his family was of what happened in the Garden of Eden and they never went to school to argue it you'll never find SC you'll never find these men entering in intellectual arguments but in the contrary they simply preach the word amen and quote the word and if there's a seed that seed will hear the word and respond to the word and if there's not they dust their feet and move on to the next city amen Church none of these but you know what the modern church has done the modern Church who brother Brandon refers to and we have a lot to read from that that we may not get to the modern church has so analyzed scripture you say the modern Church brother Matt is that us I mean we're pretty modern no no no no no no we ain't the modern church friends but there is a modern church amen there is a modern Church in fact it started at an altar in Eden with a boy named Cain who wanted to worship his way and brother brandom says that seedline of Cain has always followed the false church has always followed the true church and a picture would be like two trees that were planted right beside each other in so close that their branches and leaves intermingled and intertwined one with another and the angel said to Jesus should we go and separate them Lord no l why you try to uproot the tears you U uproot the wheat also but leave it up to me just preach the word live the word def you say brother Matan what does that mean what are we to do about the modern church and the modern Church teaching I'll tell you what the prophet of God said you ought to do he says when the true church recognizes who she is and what she stands for I said when the true church how many are the true church recognize how many would say I want to recognize who the true church is what she stands for and that she can do the Greater Works she'll will be an invincible Army when she can discern and withstand the false Church Amen brother ROM says he says when she can discern and withstand that Antichrist spirit that comes into the church trying to defile it make it lukewarm formal cold and Powerless you see that modern church has all has has everything they have all the fruits they have the fruits of the spirit my goodness more than some of the true church that modern church has love love love love man I mean just they just they just they just bury you in love bury you in programs bury your bury your children in programs and and plays and daycares and and if you don't have children they got a nice coffee shop for you serving the latest greatest espressos right there at the the front door as you walk in some of the greatest intellectual men with intellectual Minds that will that will that will fix the itch of the year who the Bible says they would Heap unto themselves teachers having itching ears that modern church has so analyzed the Bible and taken a scientific approach that's how they do they treat the Bible scientifically they treat it I'm talking about the modern Church I'm talking about the big church we got here in town would fit perfectly in what brother brandham calls the modern Church Dallas Theological Seminary trained uh the theologically trained knows the Bible knows five languages I only know one on knows Hebrew knows Aramaic knows Greek knows all the languages has all the programs has the masses of people I'm talking about reformed deformed non- denominational denominational Baptist Southern Baptist doesn't matter what name brother brandom says you need to stop calling yourself names and you need to get into Christ those names won't save you only Christ will save you but they've so modernized they they've so analyzed even the Bible you can go online and read thousands and thousands of pages of what they call apologetics they they have they have they have which is which an apologetic is a to give a reasonable gospel presentation to to to to to uh Counterpoint the points of the Skeptics am they've so analyzed the scripture that when they're done Mark 16 is added to the Bible wasn't there originally the woman at the well that was added later in fact there's parts of the Bible that we have to admit are mythical and actually never even happened Sodom and Gomorrah you know mythical amazing just a Matthew ain't it just a few weeks ago some archaeologist found the city that what they believe is the cities Twin Cities right along the Dead Sea destroyed they got all the way down to the destruction layer they had a big conference about it and the and the archaeologists are are there in that conference saying how that they believe they found these ancient cities well some Christian Scholars were there these were Christian men these are theological men trained real well- trained men and you know they're giv this they're they're you can go and watch the Youtube video of it video of it and they're they're telling how that they they were there and they asked archaeologist what' you find at the destruction layer and and they and you the destruction layer is when they get down all the way to where the City was destroyed and they said did you find arrows CU they always ask that if you find arrows that means it was not a natural disaster that destroyed the city but it was men it was an Army did you find arrows and the man gets bashful the archa don't even want to answer because they're on camera on live on live tape so they Corner them after the after the tape is after the the live event over and they Corner that man and say hey did you find arrows and he says we didn't find any arrows and he says' well then what destroyed Sodom and gomorra he says well it was a heat event and they said well what in the world's a heat event Matthew brother Matthew could give you a much better uh uh breakdown of this me and him fellowshipped about it we had both seen it and he said what in the world's a heat event he says well you you know you see what happens when when something goes over a 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit 4,000 Dees Fen when something reaches that temperature so they found some pottery down at the destruction layer and when they found the pottery they're rejoicing said oh we found real Pottery all the way back to the the Bronze Age going all the way back you know thousands of years and we could actually but they they turned it over and it was glazed and they thought oh no it's glazed that that means the destruction layer is ruined because glazing didn't come till Byzantine L time later maybe about 700,000 ad so they thought no it's been tainted but they sent off that Pottery to a lab over here in the states and they they analyzed the lab and said no no that that pottery's not been glazed well then what is what am I seeing and that that they said well it what was it called Matthew trinitite you know what trinitite is it's basically something that has reached over 4,000 degrees the same as if a nuclear bomb had nuked the pottery so what they've concluded is Sodom and Gomorrah was nuked and they found the bodies even the torsos of of some kind of a meteor common or something they hid it you know I'm sitting here that's wonderful I laugh like you laugh I said boy that's awesome isn't it awesome oh is there in Israel we went to the Israeli Museum there's the ponus pilot Stone there's the stone with Pilot's inscription did you know that theologians for years didn't believe pilate even existed maybe it was just inserted in the Bible but when they found his inscription then they suddenly said pilate must have existed when they found Sodom and Gomorrah here's this Christian the scholar and he's admitt into the IM say the other man he says you know I always just looked at this as mythical you know mythical part of the Bible and I thought my goodness you mean it took proof of a scientist an archaeologist to dig down to a layer to tell you that it was nuked for you to believe that God destroyed the city I am so glad Jesus said blessed are they that have not seen yet still have believed I'm so glad there's something in me that even though I don't have proof I still believe the word of God my faith isn't based on proof it's not based on a stone that says pilot it's not based on a piece of pottery that has 4,000 degrees it's based upon a transformation that has taking place in my life I could say I once was blind but now I see I once was deaf but now I hear I once was lost but now I'm found you say why do you believe because this this message has changed my life Hallelujah I we have a church that feels that way they've so analyzed it to where the woman at the well was added later there's mythical parts of the Bible they Chuck out anything that they see is unreasonable to their to believe by their carnal mind they even call some parts of the Bible just poetry allegorical just didn't really have a meaning they have ual variance textual criticism eschatology harmonics apologetics it's all man's attempt in a carnal intellectual way to answer the word of to answer the Skeptics against the word of God brother brandom says the very minute death entered the church and this is what he says he says she got sick she changed to a powerless group of people whose only weapon was argument let me give you an argument this is just a little excerpt of brother Perry Green's testimony I want to read it to you tonight the Lord just gave gave me this right before I came out here my family moved to Bowmont Texas in 1949 when my dad became pastor at Emanuel Gospel Church shortly thereafter we learned that there was a man by the name of William brandham that was conducting divine healing meetings in Houston Texas which was less than 100 miles away I was 16 years old how many 16 year olds raise your hand if you're 16 years old how many six 15 year olds oh don't be afraid 15 year 14 thank you thank you brother Mason how many teenagers do we have raise your hand some of those teenagers Den now I'm an adult I was 16 this is how old brother green is I just wanted to point it out just a teenager I was 16 at that time and had the baptism of the Holy Ghost and had an experience of speaking in tongues I read about Divine Healing read every miracle in the Bible and believed them since I was 9 years old I had quoted Hebrews 138 Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever I had no idea what it really meant brother Bon was in the Sam Houston Coliseum on January 23rd 1950 arrived early early enough that we were able to get a seat in the lower section right in front of the ppit about 11 rows back he says as the service began the first speaker was brother Gordon Lindsay followed by Brother FF Bosworth brother bar then brother bham came to the pull pit and as he looked across the audience he said good evening friends it was so personal I thought he was talking to me I got up out of my seat and stood in front of the platform on the left hand side near the pull pit because I thought the man had spoken to me when he called for the prayer line about 15 people came forward I found found that from where I was standing I could directly view the prayer line I had never seen one before and didn't know what to expect the first person was a little seveny year-old boy that had been blind from birth brother bham took the boy by the hand and asked us to Bow our heads while he prayed for the child as soon as the prayer was over the boy looked around like he could see everybody be to praise the Lord my thought was how do I know the boy was blind they held up a handkerchief and a little boy reached out and grabbed it they held out a microphone cour and he stepped over it brother random says now run back to your daddy the boy turned and looked out at the audience of approximately 11,000 people he had never seen his dad when the child had been called to the platform a man came and stood next to me the man now called The Boy by name that was his dad the platform was about 4 feet high and the boy came to the edge of it leaped off into the man's arm arms he played with the man's red necktie then he saw the man's tears and touched them then he be began to feel the man's face just like a CH a blind child would that was his dad he threw his arms around his dad's neck and looked directly at me I knew I had seen a miracle this was the beginning of the change of my life there was also a young lady that brought up a six-year-old boy that had been born with no feet I said no feet not a not a not a tooth AE not a headache not a backache no feet I had seen a Bo he brought up a six-year boy that hadn't born with no feet brother bham took him in his arms and asked her to remove the stockings once more he asked us to Bow our heads which I did but again I watched Upward at brother brandom as he prayed I wasn't the only one watching because in the midst of his prayer it appeared that brother brandham dropped the little boy and many people in the audience gasped right in front of my eyes I saw two little feet created this still affects me to this day when I see little baby's feet it stirs something within my soul because of this miracle that I saw even while I was weeping over that another lady walked up in front of brother Brandon he had said to those in the prayer line you people need to confess your sins and put them under the blood because I'm not responsible brother green just goes on to give testimony after testimony after testimony let me tell you something my friends I'll say it again you don't need to search for Vindication it's already been Vindicated you don't need to research it it's already been spoken from the mouth of God brother bam says when the messenger's uh voice utters the ma the the the voice from Heaven Echoes what the Earthly messenger says you know what the problem is is that people have begin to try to separate the message from the Bible okay do I have my church do we have the church here I know this gets some people uncomfortable but come on help me preach here some people have tried to separate the word word the the spoken word from the written word friend let me just say to you that's a dangerous thing to do when you cut out the living Oracle the mouth of God the voice of God when you separate the message of the hour from the Bible you lose the effect that the message needs to have on you and your family when you deduct something brother bham said to brother Bram you abort the effect of the message that it can have I know that's not popular but I'm going to preaching any way the message of the hour brother I'll just go ahead and say it like I believe it is the mind of Christ I have the mind of Christ when I turn on the tape I have the mind of Christ when I read the book I don't have to ask the question I don't even have to ask brother Google I've got the table right on my phone that's my search engine that's where I go to my answers that's where I go when I have questions and problems I've got questions and answers time and time and time and time again oh God help our people to stop looking to carnal answers you already have the devil's answer it's already been given to the Church of the Living God I say it's time we ought to stop questioning it and start believing it start identifying oursel with it and say I believe it's God's answer for any question I have I believe it's God's answer for any problem that I go through anything I face in life I've already got the mind of Christ Hallelujah let me say this the supernatural Church doesn't need a supernatural explanation God interprets his word by I said God interprets his word by God interprets his word by bringing it to pass she has the word demonstrated that's her answer I said she has the word demonstrated that's her answer Amen brother Matt I believe that brother Matt preach that brother Matt she has the word of God that's her answer that's her that that she does it she has it demonstrated even brother branam refused to go into a debate listen as brother green begins to carry this on he says the next night there was a debate about Divine Healing Dr best a Baptist preacher who didn't believe in Divine Healing challenged brother bham into a debate brother bham refused it since he didn't want to AR argue he didn't want to argue I say if he didn't want to argue you ought to not want to argue he didn't want to argue the newspapers published Dr best's challenge brother uh brother FF Bosworth asked brother bam if he could take his place in the debate brother bham agreed to as long as he didn't fuss that night Dr Bess insisted that brother Bosworth begin brother Bosworth said that he had around 600 scriptural references that show Christ attitude towards the sick is the same today it's ever been he stated that if Dr best could take any of those scriptural references and with the Bible prove that Christ Christ's present attitude is not exactly the same towards the Sick As It Ever Was he would consider himself to have lost the debate Dr best said he would handle it when he took his turn one question brother Bosworth asked Dr best was whether the Redemptive names of Jehovah applied to Jesus or not if the seven compound Redemptive names of Jehovah were not applied to Jesus then Jesus was not Jehovah Gyra which is the Lord that provides a sacrifice which is the Lord will provide but Jesus is Jehovah Gyra then he's also Jehovah Rafa which is the Lord that hthy Dr best didn't answer when Dr beess took his turn he taught that Divine Healing was applied in the resurrection when this Mortal puts on immortality he didn't answer any of the scriptural references that brother Bosworth had presented Dr best claimed that the Baptist knew better than to believe in Divine Healing brother Bosworth challenged this in a nice kind of way he asked how many Baptists were present and several hundred people stood brother B had a meeting just the night before just to just just right before that he says how many Baptists are present 300 three he says he says uh let me let me he says how many Baptists were present several hundred people stood up then he asked how many of them had been healed by the power of God that week about 300 of them remain standing he told Dr best you have no argument with me you should argue with your own people I thought that was the wisdom I that was wisdom brother Bosworth brother Bosworth used that night Dr best hit the P hit the pull pit with his fist and said the people could say anything but that didn't make it right when Dr best saw that he was not convincing the audience he started calling for the Divine healer to be brought forth trying to make a mockery of brother brandom's up in the balcony the debate was finally stopped brother Bosworth told the audience he knew that brother Brandon was in the meeting and if he wanted who he could come and dismiss the audience he could come down he was in the balcony I later learned that brother Brandon said the angel of the Lord came to him and told him that it was all right to go down I remember seeing him come into my peripheral vision as he was coming down the side of the platform can you imagine 11,000 people in audience and he says I could see him on my peripheral coming down the platform I could almost hear Brother bman the tone of gentleness and humility that he spoke there was no he says he says there was no feeling or atmosphere of animosity or Vengeance there was no feeling of you're wrong and I'm right the only way a man can truly portray that is for him to truly have feelings like that brother Brandon was just as gentle that night as he had been the night before when he walked up and said good evening friends he told the audience not to feel badly towards Dr best because he's our brother here this man had just mocked him and brother Bram says don't feel badly towards him he's our brother and that Dr best has the right to believe it in his own way he stated that brother Bosworth had proved that Divine Healing is in the Bible and that Dr best could not disprove it he continued now I have never said that I was a Divine healer I do not heal people the only thing I do is PR to preach Divine Healing by the cross and by the Bible my brother here preaches salvation and he's not a divine Savior I preach salvation and neither am I a divine Savior I also preach Divine Healing but that does not make me a Divine healer I only make my statements and if they are true God will back them up if I tell something false then God will not honor anything that's false he will always honor the truth are you glad for that I tell the truth and God knows the truth now here was this here was this man the skeptic trying to debate brother brandham and brother bram's attitude to that skeptic is don't criticize him he's our brother he has a right to see it his way Dr best hired a photographer who had taken six photos of Dr best making gestures towards brother Bosworth during the debate when the the photographer developed his film he discovered that all of his negatives were blank except the last one which showed the pillar of fire above brother brenham's head in a Halo position Mr George Lacy examiner of questions documents thoroughly examined the negative for this Photograph and then he pronounced it as authentic based upon the above described examination and study I am of the definite opinion that the negative submitted for the examination was not retouched nor is it a composite or double exposed negative further I am of the definite opinion that the light streak appearing above the head in a Halo position was caused by light striking the negative amen amen during those meetings January 3rd 1950 God updated himself to me he was no longer Jesus Christ of yesterday 2,000 years ago he was Jesus Christ today I saw blind eyes open I seen feet created and I heard the secrets of men's Hearts told he is still the same today he hasn't changed you ought to give the Lord a hand clap of praise for that cuz if he was the same then I say he's the same now he's the same God then he's the same God [Applause] now what was it it was a demonstration it was a demonstration listen friends you can't explain God you can't even explain him to yourself how would you explain him to somebody else you can't explain the love of God you could try your best you could try your try your hardest but really who can really put a word who could really give a definition to the grace and the love of Jesus Christ outside of you can just say here's the life here's an example I'm the proof that God has Grace I'm the proof that God loves because he loved me I'm the proof that God has Grace because he had Grace for me but men has came men has came along with a scientific approach a modern church and they've so analyzed the scriptures they have apologetics and harmonics as we said you know what apologetics are apologetics are the science there's your first problem of Defending one's Faith amen I said I said it's the science of Defending one's Faith do you see where the first isue is science when you try to approach God from science you're already going the wrong direction the science of given that listen to what it says here the science of defends defending one's Faith so you're already taking a naturalistic approach you're already taken the the the same approach that the atheist take trying to satisfy the Mind listen friends you will never convince the mind of an unbeliever rather than that you ought to pray that God makes them a Believer amen you ought to stop trying to argue with them and convince them of Doctrine and start praying that God changes their life removes the darkness from their heart and transforms them into a new creation because if you ever get the Holy Ghost it'll lead you to this message if you ever get the B the true baptism of the Holy Ghost he'll lead and guide you into all truth it's all about the presentation this is why I'm just reading you right from apologetics website it's about the presentation of the Gospel they say every Christian should be able to give an adequate presentation of why they have faith in Christ listen to me the world doesn't need a presentation it needs a demonstration can I get a hearty amen can you can you give me a real loud supporting amen I said the CH the world is not in need of a presentation it is is in need of a demonstration it doesn't need an explanation it just needs a revelation and it'll bring a stimulation that'll produce a transformation and until God does that all you're arguing and fussing and fighting won't do a bit of good I say give me the power of God give me a life that can be give me a sermon that can be lived not just preached give me a give me a gospel that can breathe and that can have life or than can just be understood by my human mind give me a word that can live they say we need harmonics harmonics is the branch of knowledge I'm reading you straight from what the harmonic definition is harmonics is the branch of knowledge there's your first problem that deals with interpretation especially of the Bible or literary text I'm going to give you my harmonics and it's going to just take me just a minute to find them because I didn't have them in order here tonight uh let me just find them here I'm going to give you some you say brother Matt what's your harmonics let me give you my harmonics they're right here thank you Lord make sure I didn't miss one oh they were next thank you thank you Lord notice what it says here thus sayth the Lord remember what harmonics is harmonics is the knowledge that deals with interpretation of the Bible thus saith the Lord by his unfailing word stands and shall stand and be Vindicated there is how many one one Prophet Messenger to this age and on the basis of human behavior alone anyone knows that when there are many people there is even divided opinion on lesser points of a major Doctrine which they all hold together who then will have the power of infallibility who then will have the power of infallibility anybody's hands going up which is to be restored in this last age for the this last age is going back to manifesting the pure word bride how many believers do we believe how many Believers believe that we're to go back to manifesting the pure what is the pure word this Bible is the pure word of God and the true church will go back to manifesting this in its Purity unadulterated Untouched by man or his opinions that means we will have the word once again as it was perfectly given and perfectly understood in the days of Paul I will tell you who will have it it will be a prophet is Thoroughly Vindicated or even more thoroughly Vindicated than was any prophet in all ages from Enoch to this day because this man will of necessity have the Capstone prophetic Ministry and God will show him forth he won't need to speak for himself God will speak for him by the voice of the sign why did God back this message up with thousands of signs and wonders was it so that we could oh lift brother brandom up and make brother brandham God and make him a messiah no my brother my sister he Vindicated it so that you would know it wasn't the words of a man it was the voice of God hallelujah hallelujah and we do questions and answers today by God's help we have today by God's help read this with me Church bethl Tabernacle read it with me and we do have today by help the perfect interpretation of the word with Divine Vindication Give the Lord a hand clap of praise for that are you glad you got it how many would raise a hand and say God thank you that I've got the perfect word with perfect interpretation by Vindication stand to your feet and say God I thank you more than ever before I raised my hand and thank you God God for giving me the word oh as the song says you could have easily passed me by you could have easily just went on down the road but you stopped by my seat you stopped by my house you revealed yourself to me Lord oh what have I done Lord as I could say as the song says thank you thanks for that special night Lord could you bow your heads with me raise your hands to the Lord just keep your hands raised up to God say Lord as the song says thank for that special night when I saw your glorious light oh God we just want to thank you here today we lift our hands up before you Lord father we thank you God I didn't really get to my sermon here tonight but it's a good place to stop I've read these things Lord and I believe it ignites the heart of Faith to the believer it might make the unbeliever mad that's all right Lord that's what it was sent to do it might make the skeptic mad that that's that's exactly why it was sent it might make the make believer make believe that's what it was sent for but to the True Believer which I believe that I'm preaching to I believe a True Believer has their hands raised to the True Believer these things make the believer believe and say God you're the same yesterday today and forever and I believe that as you said in your word greater work shall you do for I go to my father ask anything in my name and don't doubt and you'll have what you ask for for these signs shall follow them that believe I believe I'm I'm a Believer Lord and I raise my hands and I identify by that tonight wonder if there'd be anybody would raise their hand and say identify I want I be identified with Believers he that believeth and is baptized keep those hands up I'm going to give you a quote I'm going to give you a scripture for believers he that believeth in his baptized bow shall be saved he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay their hands on the sick and they shall recover I believe it Lord I raised my hand up to identify and say I believe it Lord Jesus I'm a believer of your revealed word I thank thank you God that when the world is being dece the church is being deceived by the world laying in the lap of of Delilah rocked asleep by every kind of wind of Doctrine Bewitched by a bewitching spirit as Galatians chapter 3 says who hath Bewitched you I'm so glad Lord that while there's a church being Enchanted Enchanted by music Enchanted by Soft sermons Enchanted by Soft preaching Enchanted by fgood messages Enchanted by doctrines of devils yeah that there's a church a true church who's being stimulated by Revelation she has her sword and she knows how to use it she has thus saith the Lord prophet of God says she has the mind of Christ she has thus sayith the Lord or she keeps still what is your thus sayith the Lord Church of the Living God it's the message of Malachi 4 you have thus saith the Lord you have the devil's answer [Music] as pause the Bible says as they prayed for boldness I would ask anybody here today could raise a hand and say Lord would you grant to me boldness to speak the word of God not the boldness to argue and fuss and quarrel but I want the boldness to speak the word of God to my loved ones to my unsaved CH whether it's children nieces nephews cousins dads mothers fathers children doesn't matter grandchildren how many would raise a hand and say Lord give me boldness to speak the word of God give me signs and wonders to vindicate my life you think that's okay to ask for they ask for it in the book of Acts how many would ask for that and say Lord let signs and wonders I'm not going to chase them but I'm asking God would you give me a sign and a Wonder to follow my life give me Mark 16 in action I'm not going to look to a church or a preacher or Ministry or some church down the road I'm going to look right down my Avenue and say let Mark 16 be an operation in my life as a Believer oh God you see the hands that are raised you hear the voices that are lifted my hand up right now God saying Lord that's my desire that's my prayer Lord Jesus pour out a double portion upon this church pour out a double portion Lord of not just hearing the word but acting upon the word of God just heard your Prophet say it today the Dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the baptism of the Holy holy ghost that we have worked in a small measure but when the word is restored the full word the full power of the Holy Ghost will be given back to the church again in so much that it will raise the dead Saints from out of the Grave oh God I just rais my hand and say Lord let me receive the Dynamics of this church
