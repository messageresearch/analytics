this thing right here but she knows when i let go of it it's over okay promise y'all love the lord i do too and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature and he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name in his name not my name not brother branham's name jesus is saying in my name shall they cast out devils and they shall speak with new tongues and they shall take up serpents and if they drink inly any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover hallelujah luke 24 49 just one little scripture there and behold i send the promise of my father upon you but tarry ye in the city of jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high now acts chapter 1 verse 8 but ye shall receive power after the holy ghost is come upon you may god add a blessings to the reading of the word you may be seated for a title i want to speak on inoculated power inoculated power inoculation is a placement of something that's going to grow or reproduce and is most commonly commonly used in respect in the introduction of a serum or a vaccine it's used on a human or an animal especially to produce or boost immunity to a specific disease it's to cause to become filled or saturated with a certain quality or principle in another word to be filled with the holy ghost that it saturates your very being hallelujah you're injected with the live virus that's what this is it's not weakened in a pure state it's in its pure state when you got a vaccine what they do they weaken the live virus and put it in you we're not weakened tonight we're not standing here under some weak word we have an inoculation power it's not being weakened by some denomination or some idea around this message come on it's not weakened by our so-called headquarters we have the pure unadulterated word of god you take someone who said it had a smallpox you inject him with the smallpox virus what's it do it builds up an immunity preach with me it builds up an immunity to fight against that disease or any disease it don't matter what disease inoculation is inserting something alive into your body just like getting a holy ghost it's something alive that god has placed in you to help you overcome every devil all right hallelujah oh they got some people says i can't live right we got people says they can't keep for the world it's a sad situation to be in it's too hard it's a bunch of rules i don't think it's a bunch of rules i love it reverend said i had young girls and young boys to tell me and old people i want to live right but i just can't keep from drinking i just can't keep from lusting i just can't keep away from these one thing you haven't tried you haven't tried the bomb he said when you take this bomb of gilead god's bomb it inoculates you from all sin it'll inoculate you from the things of the world because the world has become dead to you we got preachers across the land preaching it we've got people across the land become inoculated by it and the sin problem leaves hallelujah a sim problem leaves them because they receive god's inoculation are you inoculated this evening it takes sinners and drunkards gamblers gangsters bootleggers prostitutes message people hallelujah all of them come to calvary and are inoculated with the bomb of god's glory and his power and the sin question is settled forever hallelujah all things are passed away oh things are gone new life comes in new desires some people has to come to church to live right but i'm glad if they shut those doors tonight i don't have to have a church to live right i have inoculated power down on the inside i'm here to it's it's i'm here it'll overcome everything it don't matter what disease you got it don't matter what sickness you got it no matter what demon of depression or oppression comes against you this inoculation power can release you tonight oh hallelujah oh whoo we had that bomb right here we have that holy ghost bomb what time do i start you just stop me when i've gone too far but all they got was vaccinated by some man's idea oh hallelujah they say you don't have to come by the way a book of acts oh hello come on man they say they say you don't have to believe this message they say this message is false they say this message is wrong and brother brandon was false all you got to do is push play and obey are you vaccinated you're vaccinated all right you're vaccinated from hell that's where you received your vaccination but i know where my vaccine comes from today they say you don't have to come to the altar it's too much of a mess y'all quite every birth is a mess you got that right oh you say all you have to do is love god that's all you need to do accept him as your savior that ain't right you got your vaccine wrong one what we need today we need to be inoculated by the power of god inoculation of the holy spirit it gives you power to overcome if you can't overcome what the devil throws it throws against you come up here let us inject you tonight will it we'll inject you we'll lay our hands on you you'll overcome oh hallelujah oh we we have this vaccine for polio we got it for smallpox we got it for flu we got it for coving we got it for omicron and delta and all kinds of stuff we inject our body with all kinds of things make our bodies look good now brothers i'm gonna throw this disclaimer in here i've already had this in my notes before we y'all started this stuff this week all we want to do we want to make our body look good whatever it makes us feel good oh we'll run oh we'll run miles and we'll do planking and whatever we're doing i'll tell you what i've been working out i've been pumping iron i've been working my knees going down for prayer that's the only squatting i'm doing right now brother but we're worried about it it ain't only the women these men not y'all sorry it overcomes us what are we going to be a pretty corpse they're going to bring you up here you're just going to be a good-looking body i have a favorite scripture first timothy 4 8 for bodily exercise profit a little but godliness profited all things [Laughter] sorry i'm preaching why don't we worry about our spiritual body [Music] brother aaron give me some coffee brother well what about our spiritual body that's the one that's going to get us out of this place hallelujah we'll take care of our flesh and make it feel good get full of the holy ghost let's let this inner man feel good for a change we've seen some awful diseases in this this world spanish flu coveted bubonic plague found this interesting in october of 1347 a genevieve's fleet returned from the black sea carrying her cargo as a death sentence for europe by the time those ships landed in italy most of the sailors were dead the few who survived wish they hadn't fever wrecked their bodies festering bulls volcanoes on their skin i know something worse than this it's a sin curse on our human bodies authorities ordered the vessels out of the harbor but it was too late flea infested rats had already scampered down the ropes into the village and this bubonic dictator had begun her reload ruthless march across the continents it was thought to be contained in a harbor but the rat got out you can't contain the devil i'm going what no matter what they tried they could contain that disease because it got into rats you can't contain a devil you can't just put him up on a shelf and say okay dad will you get up in our closet you take these little little short skirt up there put it up on little shorts put it up on the shelf it's there you know it's there you know it's like when i was a young person we had walkmans man if things were they were it and if you want to listen to the music you just carry a big old case around with all your tapes in it i've seen it done i've seen people take those lord moved for them i've seen them put them in the closet only to bring them out guilty but one day those things were thrown out and destroyed you've got to destroy it take your little short skirts use shorts or whatever whatever it is that bothers you burn it you can't contain it quarantine the devil throw the cane on him hallelujah word in the world you got a stomp on him sarah don't like this story but i like telling it when we first got married we lived in a trailer out in the country well i come home from work one day and i seen her over there in the kitchen and she had a broom handle i said what in the world are you doing there was a rat in the kitchen she was and it was that's what the devil does to us he'll come before you he'll try to scare you to death but what she did when she kept poking that thing i think finally grabbed a hold of it she took it outside and started beating that rat's brains out on the porch if you've got a devil to not bother you take the word beat his brains out hallelujah oh you know what you do with rats you set traps for them set out traps you got to get rid of the rats you got to make your home rap free you got to make your home devil free whatever that devil wants to bring in it's time to kick him out you got to destroy the rats you set out poison for them right that's the way you kill them we got a poison for the rat the devil it's the blood of jesus christ it's death to the devil but it's life to the believer hallelujah set out traps for him but instead he sets out traps for us this is one of my favorite statements i stole it from somebody i might already said it here once before if the devil is not under your feet he's out of place is he under your feet tonight he's undermined the greatest disease bigger than his black death was sin sin can hit and wipe you out before you realize what's hit you asked adam and eve in a garden that's what happened there satan started coming up and whispered in her ear what did god say spill the tea sis tell me what god said when sin hits you unless you're gonna change the soul to get inoculated it's death to you that's what happened in the garden of eden it was death to them god seen them he said i can't leave you like this he says i'm gonna go to my laboratory and i'm gonna start working on a cure i'm gonna start working on a cure for sin first thing he did he just throw lambskins on them with that blood they walked out of the garden the blood of bulls and goats was what the old testament needs but that couldn't take away sin that wasn't a cure god started working on his laboratory oh hallelujah he gave moses the blood of bulls and goats you know when a man starts to find a vaccine to cure sin they start small they don't find a cure after the first time it took a while to find the cure just like god he started out with the blood of bulls and ghosts they didn't eradicate sin it was just for covering it wasn't a cure because they had to come back to offer another one for the sins they committed after the first time year after year they had to come back and repent for what they have already what sins they committed that year god worked at his laboratory to find a cure for sin god eventually says i found it next thing you know you hear you hear a prophet speaking behold a virgin shall conceive hallelujah he said i've got to come down myself i've got to take up a flesh body i got to take a body to live in i must be led to the slaughter like a lamb i've got to be crucified for you that's the cure that's the only way it can eradicate sin oh brother he says i got to give my life for sacrifice that'll not only cover sin it'll eradicate it i'll tell it a minute i'll definitely eradicate it here a little bit what we need was a blood from a pure unadulterated blood of jesus christ doctors and scientists that's what they started using guinea pigs or little rats to test out their vaccine to see if it works for us first that's scary before they try it on human beings they'll make sure it works first they take the rat or water animal they use it eject it with a virus and then put the inoculation to see if it's effective to see what it what about the side effects of it i tell you god's so sure of his he vaccinated himself hallelujah brother branson said jesus christ the son of god when he was born some of them says well now he was the egg of mary god the creator overshadowed the virgin mary and created the cells within her womb and brought forth a man which was emmanuel god himself made flesh with with no help from anybody he's the creator who made the first man oh my there he is there he stands and then he did that so he could take the inoculation went down to the river john baptized him brought him up the holy ghost fell up on top of him went into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil 40 days to show the devil that this thing is real show the devil that he had the inoculation power to overcome everything he throwed at him to show you what you can have tonight to get inoculated you have power do you realize what kind of power you have you don't because if you got sickness you'd speak to it in the name of jesus sickness leave in the name of jesus disease leave in the name of jesus every demon flees hallelujah he come down and walked on this earth a perfect man went to the rarely baptized by john god inoculating himself at the river went up to the world to be kept of the devil he came down off of that mountain victorious he showed that the inoculation held he went to the garden of gethsemane great drops of blood and sweat in agony if it be your will let this cut past for me the vaccine held he went to pilas hall took the whips the vaccine held went to calvary nailed up there vaccine held to show you whatever you're going through it don't matter what it is this inoculation is going to hold you you feel like you're so down you feel like there's no way out but i'm here to tell you tonight that inoculation power has made a way back for you oh god had a vaccine at a work on the human race that's the kind i want something to keep me in times of temptation when the devil have you back against the wall oh my goodness it will hold somebody talks about you it's going to hold this is your cure for mind battles you don't know whether this message is right for wrong we got your cure we have you cured tonight we have to answer that all the questions hallelujah it's a cure for looking like the world it's a cure for going out there looking for a boyfriend or a girlfriend it's a cure it's inoculation against sin it puts demons are running there's you way back oh hallelujah it's inoculation of god it's a double cure like when brother brown says that you must take god's bomb got serum he's got it it's a double cure for sin they don't know scientists have no double cure they'll give you a vaccine shot for covet then you got to go get another one and then you got to go get three or four booster shots we have a remedy that god has given us that'll deliver us from sin that delivereth from this world that we live in we have inoculation that's going to get us out of this world and take us in a rapture but we refuse it definition of a remedy a medicine an application or treatment that relieves or cures a disease i just put the bomb the holy ghost it corrects or counteracts to cure relieve or heal i like this one to restore to the natural or proper condition there's the ticket back he's going to restore you back to where you were before the foundation of the world predestinated in his mind hallelujah back to where there was no sin back to where there was no devil this is a remedy for the new birth the new birth is so it's no different from any other birth it's a mess sorry sister and every once in a while when it comes up on me i'll get messy again with it i'll cry i'll boohoo and carry on i guess i don't look very good i'm not very good to look at i've got something down on the inside of me that's taken me on and on and on and on he's not stuck and on it'll take you to eternity hallelujah that's what that inoculation power will do for you hallelujah people refuse it they don't like the thoughts of being born again and some of these modern teachers teach the new birth is to walk up and take fellowship with the church that's the new birth they're wrong all you gotta do is join our camp join this camp oh lord or should i say all you have to do is come to our stillwater camp all they're produced is stillborn babies there's no power of inoculation inoculating our young people to face the devil to get them out of this world oh it's a mess a new birth is a mess there's no difference when a man's born again it makes him do things he wouldn't think he's going to do it makes you squall it'll make you boohoo and carry on it might make you do things you think you would ever do but it brings new life that's the main thing the new life [Music] oh but i believe there's people sitting here tonight that once was infected by sin not no more you receive the antidote how many people have satan destroy says the garden of eden they haven't received the antidote but i'm looking at people tonight that can't be destroyed hallelujah i'm trying to be good it's like a man dying on the doctor's steps if a doctor has a remedy for the disease the man just sits on a step but refuses to take the remedy he will die there and it is a doctor's fault if you sit here tonight and you can't get rid of your sickness you can't get rid of your disease or your sin or demons it's your fault we have plenty of brothers here we got plenty of doctors in the building we'll give it to you we'll lay hands on you you'll receive it oh the cure found you one day you better be in the bar room somewhere i've heard many people talk about they get into a bar room they get drunk they start talking about the lord hey i guess whatever it takes to get them you might have been sitting on a church pew in a message church but one day that light struck that seed it came to life you've got a new birth you've become inoculated oh glory there's a physician there the people won't take his medicine the local church member luke warren thinks he's too good to take the medicine of the holy ghost i hope he don't ever think we're too good tonight if the lord wants me to get up and run down that aisle i want to be willing to do it if he wants me just sit here and cry like a baby i want to be able to do it it don't matter what anybody says you will go to you know you go to the doctor's office you call doctor up i need to make an appointment i got a headache doctor looks through his calendar see i get you sometime in november the 14th how's that ain't gonna do you no good we got a doctor to the building tonight all you gotta do is call him up it's a walk-in clinic you've walked into the clinic tonight we're here he's here he's here he's here to help you he's here to save you he's here to deliver you you know sometimes doctors when they want to test something they'll get a few people we got something for back pain i want to test it out so get a few dummies i was a dummy once because i i got talked into doing this i had back pain it was too bad but i said okay if anything could help me i'd take it but realize the more i took it something's wrong i'm not feeling a thing and i would tell this i'm gonna say his name but he's my cousin i said what'd you give me sugar and water he started laughing i said you don't want me to feel better but he wanted what some people gets a placebo effect and they think they've got it because sometimes it does work with your mind i've heard it it worked with your mind you make you you are feeling better and that's what happens to some people in the church [Music] i'm glad this is between us they'll come to church they'll feel the movement of god shout a little bit go right out the door and same person all you got was a little placebo effect you might as well went to the doctor the doctor says hey i got your cure come here and he gets a big old syringe about that long a needle that long empty so i got your cure right here and jabs into your arm you'll be kind of mad wouldn't you he said doc i come in for the flu shot you're giving me nothing we go a lot of places there but we won't placebo effect people are getting a simple effect in church what we thought we had our real holy ghost we didn't because what it did on what you got on sunday monday was already gone we need to get the real thing if you ain't got the real thing let's get the real thing if you got a real thing we got booster shots tonight [Music] we've done being inoculated we got booster shots so i'm gonna fall over his guitar in a few minutes they just didn't get inoculated all the way they didn't get inoculated all the way to the soul that's where you get your power that's where you get your overcoming power oh why don't we sit in church and feel the power of god moving around i'm falling on some people lord bless them lord bless him but don't please lord don't make me act like that lord please just give it to me real quiet like he might he might give it to you you might be prying for a run around hallelujah there's no doubt this inoculation powers gives you down payment it's your down payment for heaven it's a down payment for the rapture it's your earnest of your salvation we know storybrooke remembers what earnest was he said if i he said i want to buy a boat for my brother and the brother says it's ten thousand dollars brother brown says okay i'll give you 50 to hold that but it's okay that's the earnest of he having that boat brother if the earnest of salvation makes you feel like is what's going to happen when you get the full power it ain't gonna be able to hold you hallelujah body will break forth phew you receive full power power for rapture to lead this place let's go to acts chapter 2 verse 37 and see what the prescription is for sin now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto peter and to the rest of the apostles men and brethren what shall we do and then peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remissions of sins and you might receive it you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost that's a promise for the promise is unto you it don't stop there it goes to your children and it don't stop there it goes hallelujah and to all that are afar off even has met the key word even as many as the lord our god shall call shall invite there's only a certain amount of people invited this party you know what it is you have a birthday party for your kids you got party favors you hand out the door tonight brother luther handed out joy he said you can have it bring joy in here bring happiness we got party favors we've got healing god gave gifts to the church he gave apostles he gave pastors he gave teachers he gave gifts this toxin is not for everyone it's only for those it's called i'm called you know peter was started preaching his first sermon can you imagine how he felt just a few days before that he's out there cursing i don't even know the man he's like how can god use me and god used that man to perform the first miracle in the new testament there by the caleb that's the shadow of peter i want it to be where thy shadow can walk by somebody and they're healed lord jesus he's been inoculated by the holy ghost he wondered how he got that job to be the first preacher in the new testament under this holy ghost once he was inoculated he'd done the same work that jesus done silver and gold have i none but such as i have i give to thee so i don't have silver and gold tonight but such as i have i'll give it to you they shall lay thy hands on the sick and they shall recover you know smallpox was eradicated i thought i was going to get here sometime so this

unity there's power the words one according to the book of acts shows exactly what one accord will do when god is involved the word one of course has a variety of meanings such as togetherness of
