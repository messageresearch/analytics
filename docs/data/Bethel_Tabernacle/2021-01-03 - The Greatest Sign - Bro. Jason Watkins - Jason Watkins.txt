that with brother tony it's funny because we got confused on who was leading songs and so i walked in the back and he was leading he said i was just preparing in case you weren't ready so when i got out to come here andrew said i got a list from tony and i got a list from you i said we'll make this work don't worry for the kid come on you could be seated got something special amen now my dad our pastor told us to do that he said a song leader that said if no one has a special you call somebody out of the audience a gifted singer to come up and sing so i'm just obeying the pastor here by the [Music] king [Music] um [Music] so [Music] just test test test can you turn that up just a little bit test well i haven't sung in a while and nothing like being put on the spot so y'all pray for me actually never sung this song in the church before we were practicing it and amariah sung it and uh so i didn't sing it but this has been on my heart pretty heavy so we'll try it key of d andrew they say sometimes you win some sometimes you lose some right now right now i'm losing man [Music] i've stood on this stage night after night reminding the broken it'll be all right right now oh right now i just can't [Music] it's easy to sing when there's nothing to bring me down but what will i say when i'm held to the flame like i am right now i know you're able and i know you can save through the fire with your mighty hand but even if you don't my hope is you alone [Music] they say it only takes a little faith [Music] little faith is all i have right now but god when you choose to leave mountains unmovable give me the strength to be able to see it as well with my soul i know you're able and i know you can't save through the fire with your mighty hand but even if you don't my hope is you alone i know the sorrow when i know the herd would all go away if you just say the word but even if you don't my hope is you alone you've been faithful you've been good all my days jesus i will cling to you come with me cause i know you're able i know you can't oh i know you're able i know you can save through the fire with your mighty hand but even if you don't my hope is you alone i know the sorrow i know the hurt would all go away if you just say the word but if you don't my hope is [Music] it is well with my soul it is well it is well with my soul [Music] i appreciate that hey man what a testimony it is well amen even if sister amber has a special force come on sister amber and make your way isn't it good just to be back together again i might just have everybody sing even those that never sing i might just call on you no i'm just kidding sister amber come on thank you brother tony and brother ken appreciated those specials amen when peace like a river attendeth my way

just want to raise your hand to the lord at this time let's bow our heads father we just come to you again and we're so appreciative lord of all that you do for us and we're thankful lord for your grace and kindness lord you see each hand that went up lord you know the request would be on our hearts father i pray you'd meet each one i pray that you would be with us in this service lord help us

the lord sure was enjoying all of that worship and all of that singing and all that special singing wow man i was about to have a runaway in the back praise the lord amen nice to have you all here today i'm gonna have a beautiful day for aaron good to see you in your family again god bless you amen brother joel there you stand praise god brother good to have you here among us this morning praise god we're going to invite you into the scriptures this morning to the 17th chapter of luke i want to read just a familiar passage and just move right in to what the lord has been dealing with me on for quite a little while now and it's been coming more in pieces than it has up and that that that happens sometimes sometimes you're you're just the heavens open and the floodgates and it just falls on you and you just write out a whole sermon lock stock and barrel in a moment and then sometimes the lord just put a little piece here and there and you just keep making notes and you you keep adding because you you keep feeling the same inspiration and that's going to be the case for today and i think that's fitting because it's our first sunday uh in the new year praise the lord amen so i want to just really establish you know where we are and what we should be expecting i was listening in the back to brother matt's sunday school and i think that's was part of the labor at least of his heart was to really correctly identify uh where we are and because if you you remember brother branham talks about that when the bride recognizes who she is then there's something attached to that then that's the time when the enemy is completely defeated by her amen he's he's he's as thwarted by her as he was by jesus in the wilderness that that's when she can do the mighty works and so when she recognizes who she is satan will be powerless before her so you know in the same vein you you want to find out where we are in prophecy this is why brother branham would take a sermon modern events and teach us of really a principle that's not just a sermon that's a principle modern events are made clear by prophecy because you need to know who you are and you need to know what's up you need to know what is to be expected and you need to know how to go about it you need marching orders amen so i think that that's why every ministry brother branham talks about will be that's the first fundamental principle of a god called ministries it's based on the word of god not conjecture or opinions or thoughts or meanderings or ramblings it's actually based on the word because the heavens and earth will pass away but the word won't my word will fail your word will fail but his word can't fail amen so i want to be feeding on the body word of the son of man amen that's it it is that feeding that'll change your body it'll take us in the rapture praise the lord all right somebody help me which lafontaine is this solomon god bless you brother amen i wasn't going to take a stab at it i'd miss it amen micah good to see you young man praise the lord happy to have solomon brother micah here with us so you guys uh brother kenny found your house yet or uh hey man brother kenny amen we're working on it amen praise the lord so that's one of those times where i'm happy to be a conspirator amen praise the lord amen luke 17 very familiar to us want to just take um and let's let's start in verse 24 i think would be a good place just for context for as the lightning that lighteneth out of the one part under heaven shineth unto the other part under heaven so shall also the son of man be in his day but first must he suffer many things and be rejected of this generation see and as it was in the days of noah so shall it be also in the days of the son of man they did eat now he's going to make a comparison to noah's day they did eat they drank they married wives they were given in marriage in other words they just were normal life it's life going on all right you know what happened they ran into a new year's day and then another one and then another one and this went on and he says that they did eat they drank they married wives they were given in marriage until the day that noah entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all likewise also as it was in the days of lot here it is again normal life they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they builded you know they went to school they invested they had parties they had life they raised kids they took vacations all right but the same day that lot went out of sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed let's pray father we're grateful to you lord in such a focused way this morning because we realize that we would we owe you everything lord everything we owe you everything we owe you a debt we could never repay father and and i'm i'm glad that the only thing you've asked in return is is a dedicated heart sincerely to come to god and allow the lord to allow the word to be the director of our lives lord today i i'm happy to do that lord i'm just happy to stand for jesus and say i'll take the way with the lord's despised few i'm happy to do it i'm ready to do it i'm eager to do it lord i have proven these long years of my life that i am altogether incapable lord of of chaining two successful days together i need you lord i'm relying on you we're trusting in you this first sunday of the new year we don't know how many more years or how many more first sundays maybe this will be the last first sunday of a new year oh what a what a wonderful thought that gives us father so now but but here we are we'd like to have been long gone but here we are so lord i want that day we long for that day but as the poet said until then my heart will go on singing until then with joy i'll carry on lord that's what we're going to do today we're going to carry on father you said that we should do that keep till i come lord and and and and we're looking for that great reunion father now we realize that if we're still here we must still have more to do there must still yet be some left to find there must still be some work that must be accomplished in our lives so father today on this first sunday how fitting it would be lord of everybody in this building and on the streaming audience lord could just purpose in their heart to say this very first sunday of a new year i want us purpose from this day i'm going to serve god a little more i'm going to be more sincere i'm going to pray more i'm going to be more studious in my bible reading and my time to gather lord and i and i want to i want to go higher on the mountain lord i pray you a granite father while the world is plunging and falling we realize the bride has been placed into an order of ascending and so lord we want to be i want to be busy about the father's business so may you grant that to us today we confess all of our failures of the past year in the past days and the past hours lord we confess it all and put it all under the blood we we don't look back lord and cry over spilled milk we we go forward lord marching to zion beautiful beautiful zion we take courage and fresh courage and fresh purpose this morning lord to do all that we can in service to his majesty the king grant it to us lord we ask it of the humbly in jesus name amen god bless you friends you can be seated brother kev we're going to hit a few scriptures here out of matthew we're going to first go to mark's gospel in the second chapter and just idle there for a moment i'll give you the verse momentarily it's a incredible day that we live in it's not a day that you want to underestimate this is a day that things are happening in the kingdom of god and in the world i mean things are happening so fast and they're not little small movements big things are happening even small things are big and because the stakes are so high and we realize that you know i i i want you to to try to i'm going to try to bring your mind into the into the vision that i've had for this sermon i want to i've titled it the greatest sign you know i want to say that the hour that we have arrived at we certainly haven't arrived here by accident you haven't just stumbled into this you haven't just you know i was just walking along actually that's not true the footsteps of the righteous are ordered over the lord and god doesn't wait till you get born again to start affecting that on your life you understand that from the day you were born as a child of god brother branham would teach us so clearly that you did not become a son on the day you repented you might have fell at an altar you might have an experience that any one of us could stand up in here today and say on this certain day this was happening and this was going on and god got a hold of me and from that day i have been a son or daughter of god that's actually a nice way to say it it gives you a little bit of clarity and helps you focus and helps you testify to somebody you know when did you come to the lord and you've got your testimony but really friends the larger uh 50 000 foot view shows us that you were actually always a child of god and that that that really what happened on that day of conversion is you just started cooperating in the vision but it's a vision god has had for you before there was stardust and i you know that's my prayer that i pray for myself i pray it for my family i pray it for you and for your family lord i have one motive and objective in life and that is to reach the vision that you saw of me before the foundation of the world i don't want to come up short i don't want to be left of the target i want to hit the bullseye listen friends that's not just a psychology lesson striving for excellence i mean that's that's good too but this is a much more important thing just striving for excellence in business or striving for excellence in the community or you know striving for excellence and and and education you know this is more than that this is trying to to to equalize your your human life with all of your bumps and knots and warts with all of your weaknesses and failures and your doubts and your fears with all of your anxiety i get it and understand this god understands all that and and and but yet he has still got a purpose to bring you to the exact bullseye of the vision he has for you and that's really what your life is all about and i can't account for your neighbor i can't account for what's happening in politics fully i get i get it it's an event clear to me in prophecy but i'm simply saying it's madness to me you know but i i want you to know friends i i'm not here to try to qualify the what the how the why the reasoning or even to make sense of what we see going on in the world other than to say it's the end time but i but i am preaching to you today and to let you know that there is not a single thing that has or is or shall or can happen in your life but what god has a very distinct purpose behind it and you just need to ask yourself today am i in line with his vision is my life cooperating with his because if it's not oh man oh buddy let me tell you something i hope to convince you by the end of the sermon today you're going to want to have your life every minute detail of your life fixed in in synchronous harmony with god's plan for you it's interesting how that the world stumbles it it's not new that they stumble around in darkness and they can't make sense they can't answer the why you know these things have their humor and i'm i'm i'm i i don't know what i'm looking for when i do it but i've had some interesting responses and you walk in a store and here comes some salesman or floor lady or somebody coming along and and um you know say can i help you oh you know we're uh we're just looking you know and if there's anything if there's anything you need to know just ask and i wait for him to turn away and i go what's the meaning of life and generally i get i get a stun look like um well not that question but any other question you have and a lot of times you know the there's been a few times where it was a great conversation starter but it's it i find it um in one sense i get it completely but in another sense it all it never ceases to amaze me that how thick or how dull the hearing and the eyesight is of the of the average man who looks at these calamities in the world and just looks at him and blinks a few times and just just goes wow what's the world coming to and then right back to their treadmill you know but but you know the the believer has a a different kind of an idea than that because we realize that our life's not an accident and my life is not accidental and i i i'm here by a purpose and so i want to be driven by that purpose they got all kinds of books they write and little sayings and memes about a purpose-driven life my goodness they i don't think that you know what what man understands as important isn't it isn't it isn't it true that in the scriptures mankind humanity is warned to not think more highly of himself than is good or that he should that that what man calls great now i'm preaching to you today on the greatest sign what man calls great god calls foolishness that's the contrast and and what what man calls foolishness god calls great you know it's it it's i i i used to i used to tell my sons and i i didn't invent it i heard it and coined it and and and they would say you know dad you know let's do this and uh no i don't wanna oh come on daddy oh no no no please you know i say look here's how it's gonna work i do it you happy uh or no i said i said i don't do it me happy i do it you happy better me happy [Laughter] better me happy and so you know i i know how the world wants the world to go and i get it human people want to survive they want to prosper i understand that but it's it's such a it's such a sadness it becomes a profound sadness to me that that people trying to live and trying to succeed and going about it with no regard to their manufacturer and the manufacturer sent them a a a guidebook okay i built the world i put you in it i built you here's how you here's how you succeed and they go oh no no no no you know and they're not interested in that and by contrast i'm only interested in this like i mean isn't that true we're not weird i mean they're weird i'm i'm actually operating by the owner's manual and i to me that makes sense but you find even all the way back through history let's look at a few examples you know here come these pharisees and jesus is you know conducting his ministry and he's got his his disciples with him and you know they're they're they're doing certain things on a sabbath day and these pharisees trying to find fault they always do pharisees always you know pick at little things to find fault and you know you know what about this and what about that and and jesus here's his answer in mark chapter 2 verse 25 brother kevin look at simple little verse and jesus look how he starts it out with mark 2 25 and he said unto them have you never read what david did and just that that whole statement have you never read what what are you guys you you're that thick have you never read what david you're sitting here asking me a question you should know the answer to have you never read what david did when he had need and was hungry he and they that were with him and jesus is standing talking about a question for the ages put those guys to complete silence hey you guys are are you that dumb you're questioning the action and my action is not contrary to the word have you never read the word it's you you you think homosexuality should be an acceptable lifestyle that everybody should accept have you never read where have you never read where see look at look at matthew let's go to the gospel of matthew the 21st chapter brother kevin matthew 21 and verse 16. now jesus is going to answer another question they're challenging him and he said he said unto them hearst thou what these say and jesus saith unto them yea have you never read out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou has perfected praise oh i'm sorry you think that what we're doing is strange have you never read you think this is bad have you never opened your bible oh i get it you don't actually live by what the bible says and that's why you think we're a cult have you never read oh what are you always talking about a prophet uh have you never read malachi 4. you know what's what's what's this about you know the seventh age and the seventh angel have you never read revelation 10 have you never read revelation 3 do you do you have have you never you know why why are you people why are you not a denomination have you never read revelation 18 4 come out of her my people what do you think that's talking about oh my you know we want to know what i think sir we want to know what you know what's what's the vatican doing what's going to be their decision on this why don't you people seem to care and respect you know papa the holy father um have you never read the book of revelation at all matthew stay that same chapter uh go down matthew 21 42 jesus saith unto them did you did you never read in the scripture the stone which the builders rejected the same has become the head of the corner news flash this is the lord's doing and it is marvelous in our eyes i know you think it's wrong and weird and upside down but actually to us it's a marvelous thing i'm sorry you don't get it but you know maybe maybe you should read your bible a little more maybe you should desire that your life come into harmony with this book oh that's my desire friends that's what i desire the greatest sign one of the certainly you know why i was i think i just gave you a few pieces of this testimony recently and uh i went to uh a new chiropractor and very nice man appreciate him i was really great and planned to go back and plan to keep witnessing to him you pray that the lord give me wisdom because i i can't even you know normally when you sit down on a doctor's table i mean the first question you get is not normally so you know the sinner walking on the street what about him i'm like so my neck is kind of hurting and that's kind of why i'm here oh yeah we're going to get to that don't worry but you know what do i say when i because he's a nominal christian man and i can't even and okay let's move you over here uh pastor and he puts me up and he puts this machine you know and you know what what does the bible say about what's going on this political mike are you a doctor am i at a doctor's office where you know why don't you come to church and and and and it's and finally finally i just i just kind of put it i was as i told you when i started here this morning that's been coming to me in bits and pieces and this is almost kind of where it started this was maybe you know three or four weeks ago and this is kind of where it started and i kept he just kept every time i'd go in and he he wouldn't even ask me about my condition oh yeah we'll get to that uh but uh yeah i'm gonna charge you money for it we'll get to it in a minute but let me first let me get some free stuff off of you first and so uh you know he's asking about this thing in the world and this thing in the world and also this thing and what's going on in this nation and iran and the in the white house and the kremlin and china and i just and he says don't you think that those things are are signs aren't aren't those likes supposed to be epic signs of the of the end don't you think we're near the end and i said i said those those signs pale in comparison to luke 17. and he said luke 17 luke 17. i said have you never read i thought about jesus words have you never read jesus prophecy in luke 17 that as it was in the days of noah as it would be in the days of of lot and and how that jesus prophesied the lightning would travel from the east under the west and how that and how that in each age that there would be a uh that it would have to be a a rejection i started to i started to to note that for you uh go back brother kevin and let's look at the 24th verse again for as the lightning of luke 17 24 for as the lightning that lighteneth out of one part under heaven shineth unto the other part under heaven so shall also the son of man be in his day and of course you've got to be careful as a bible teacher that you keep the the the uh what god is doing with the gentiles and what he's doing for the sake of under the trumpets and i'm not trying to go down that way today because otherwise some things don't they historically they look like wow the gospel was already pretty far west and then suddenly revival jumps back east and falls in russia and then it falls in germany you know and and it should have long ago it was already crossed into into philadelphia it was already in america you know and now and now we're taught brother ramsey talks about you know in the the welch revival and all that but and and and the and the and the revival that fell in russia in different places and you got to understand that god's doing one thing when the lightning's traveling from the east to the west he's got one plan for the jews one plan for the gentiles amen is that clear so one works under the seals one works under the trumpets and you can't you got to keep them straight or to look like it's jumping back and forth and so so but then he says here verse 25 so uh last part of verse 24 so shall also the son of man be in his day but first verse 25 but first he must suffer many things and be rejected of this generation now now that implies a rejection in at every time the sun goes a little further west there's a rejection of that age a little further rejection in that age a little further that's what makes it keep going further you understand and so every generation every age every the the be rejected of this generation and every time it arrives in a generation it's going to be rejected and it'll move on to the next generation well uh i'm here to tell you something friends you're the last generation you're the last generation that that this is we we have the greatest sign the days of noah have returned the days of sodom have a lot have returned and that's a half century ago you're so far into total blindness you're living in the age of impossibility you're in the last elements where god is separating out and and and and shaving it down say you know this one's jumping out and this is doing that and this one's saying that it doesn't matter it's supposed to be that way but there's also supposed to be a bride who says i believe more today than i did yesterday i'm more in love with god today than i am yesterday and that's not your superpower that's god's power dropping down upon your life we should be glad and rejoice to be able to see ourselves in the scriptures when i look in the scriptures and it shows how that family is to be acting and i see i i see a natural thing in my heart that when i read in the bible how the early church acted and reacted and how that they lived and the standards that they held and the beliefs that they held i'm sure it's true with you too i read it and there's an affinity and i go yeah that's how i like being that doesn't that's not a superpower of me that's god who's changed my heart who's given me a whole new nature and and and in fact is when i when i'm in my life going through my life and you know a lot of times you you better be an honest human being today or i'm you're going to really expose yourself as dishonest every time a human being it's not just vanity it's i don't know what it is psychologically but every time you walk past a mirror you stop okay come on [Laughter] i know maybe sometimes you look at the mirror and go oh but but you're always going to take take a stop you know i like walking past this mirror and i like walking past this mirror and going oh wait a minute hold on let me make sure okay let's see how i look oh yeah okay oh well i better change that sorry friend i can't go with you there anymore sorry i'm gonna have to what's wrong with you why have you separated well i went and stood in front of a mirror and the rest is history not true feel privileged that you like doing that feel privileged that when you read this paul said that's what paul said that he said there's a crown that's waiting me i've ran my race see paul's not here to run yours paul said i've ran mine and i have finished my course and from henceforth there's a crown awaiting me but hey hear paul's words today as paul says to you out of the bible not to me only but all of you all who love his appearing and i'm here to tell you feel privileged today if in your heart you love his appearing you love this message you love it's purity you love it's holiness you love what it's asking of you you know that i i remember hearing not too many years ago um i forget now who was doing it some radio preacher and he was doing a series on marriage and child raising and he said that they had recently completed a big study and a lot of data and you know there was the whole big concept of training up a child in the way that it should go because you know the bible doesn't just say raise children says train them up and i've i've i've had i've encountered lazy parents who don't want to do that and i just say well you're going to train them whether you want to or not your life is training them i don't care if you don't want to put in the time just understand you're training them they're watching how you live and how you act and how you react and you can't stop that so kick and scream all you want but that's the way humanity works and and so he was talking about how that you know there's this idea of training them up according to god's word which which tells you to train them which talks about a rod of correction which talks about discipline which talks about borders and parameters and ancient landmarks you don't move them and and and you want to make sure you do this and do that and then the whole other side was you know just leave them to their own devices and let them decide i mean little little did anyone imagine that in the 1950s and 60s when they were starting to preach that and just say just let them be who they're going to be little did they imagine that four and five-year-olds would be would just decide well i think i'm gonna be a boy today but tomorrow i'll be a girl and now the world who went with that for all these decades they're stuck and they just kind of have to go yeah that's a little weird but it's normal until now so many people have said it's normal that it's normal not normal with me not normal with the bible not norm with god's word see it's it's the highest form to to to not train your children in the ways of the lord is the highest form of of child abuse in existence because there's there's physical abuses that can take place and and the world is filled with very sad stories but but at the same time it's men and women who have overcome those physical abuses who have overcome a lot of those psychological abuses and have great testimonies how that they got past it and made something of themselves and training other people but i'm here to tell you something friends when a soul is so corrupted and so poisoned and so absent of anything about god that's a much worse case much worse case because it is not in a man the bible teaches us this is from the owner's manual now all right this manufacturer is letting you know that he didn't build you with the ability to guide your own life he gave you 10 senses to contact reality around you but those were never given to guide you see that that that a man needs a guide and that's the lord prophets need them husbands need them mommies need them teenagers need it they need a guide they need the holy ghost it's not in a man it's not even in his wiring it's not in it's not installed to guide his own way there's got there's got to be an over-the-air update by the holy ghost to come down and and create a new birth and then that life force inside you now you've got something that'll guide you and what is it guiding you say is it going to guide me to be a millionaire well it might or it might you might still stay a pauper but on the other side you'll have riches and treasures the world can't equal see so we don't measure our lives by succe by the world's standard of success what they call success is generally ruination and that is inarguable historically that that you know listen you say well if i just had a few million dollars there's there's people with many millions of dollars who jump out of 50 story windows many with many millions if i just had this many you know 100 000 likes and facebook friends there's many stars with millions of followers who overdose on drugs and check out you know there's lots of people who reach the pinnacle of success there's been rich men who were billionaires and and jumped out a window and in their suicide letter they discovered that the reason they killed themselves was because they were down to just a few million dollars and couldn't face it and these are these are true stories and so so you know i i i remember saying to this this very fine doctor and i said the greatest sign to the earth is that the ministry of the son of man returned and he was as clueless as to what that meant and so i got my work cut out for me you keep praying for me but that just stunned him stopped him he thought about that for a minute a son of man okay so the son of man is and he's looking for more answers and you know that that today friends is the greatest sign you can look at that the ministry of the son of man has returned when when that's true that means the gospel has come all the way west now and the next event is a body change the next thing is a translation and you say but but shouldn't it have come shouldn't it have come you know 10 years ago well we'd like for it to come 50 years ago my my sister jeans here today sitting in those meetings uh wanted it to come you know 60 years ago but well here we are here she is we're still standing i i know this i'm going to keep going because i i have already seen that it's real and i can't deny it i'd have to deny my own self i have seen the greatest sign i don't i don't need to worry about whatever the vatican or the kremlin or the white house or or the u.n or or china or beijing is doing i don't care it doesn't matter i've seen the sign i've seen his star hallelujah and i've already been resurrected into new life and i can feel myself being changed i can feel that my desires are not what they used to be this is the true uniting time and sign eagles gather together why do they because there's a carcass to feed on see and you know this is why that eagles need to gather together around the word you know as a and more so as we see the age going into darkness you know sometimes you feel like saying to the world have you never read have you never been taught out of the bible that that without this message of grace to to come on the earth that all all humanity including all their churches are are absolutely uh under a death sentence an inescapable curse and doom that he promised in malachi 4 it's incredible to me it takes my breath away that people just blow to pieces when you start trying to suggest that there's a prophet a gentile prophet according to malachi 4 5 and 6 that would have to come in the last days and people go nuts over that and without any regard to the purpose that he was coming lest i smite the earth with a curse and do you realize that if it were not for this message of grace that god has sent that message has fulfilled luke 17 30 the earth would have long ago been destroyed and everything with it but i'm here to tell you god who is rich in mercy has fulfilled it and we are partakers and we are the benefactors of it today and and and you know malachi 4 itself is actually as i've preached many times is is a is a divine injunction you know to seal the family of god into the kingdom lest i smite the earth with a curse but i'll send elijah quickly and he'll come in on a short quick demonstration gather a bride of gentiles before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord and he'll get his mission done and go home and it'll perfect the bride and it'll just go now i know that over decades and decades and decades it doesn't feel like kind of feels like boy i never thought i would have kids wow well at least i'll never have grandkids oh okay i guess i will well they'll never go to school okay so they went to school you know i was i was looking very fondly maybe yesterday or the day before i don't remember exactly and actually came across it actually i think i was looking for something else that's what it was and i stumbled across a picture of brother eddie uh when he was 10 years old his 10 year old boy i sit there looking at that joyous little face of a 10 year old boy who would eventually be my dad and he's just 10 years old and he's just sitting there all full of hope and life and you know and uh brother eddie had that smile to the day he died he was always friendly everybody got around him always liked him he was just a gregarious jovial fun to be around person hadn't no had no natural enemies and accept the devil and uh and i thought wow dad here here here you are on a in a picture that that snap shotted it just snapshot it a moment in history it just history was meandering along and here's a little boy sit down in front of a camera and a camera went click and froze that right there and history just kept going and that picture just froze and and it'll never come it'll never come back to that and it kept on going and i thought now here you are and my youngest grandchild is older than you were which means your youngest great granddaughter is now older than you were in that picture i'm here to tell you something friends life ain't very long i know sometimes it just feels like but it's not it's zooming it's moving so quick you you'll get astonished you young people will be astonished if the lord continues to tarry i'm here to tell you something life isn't long it's over quickly make the most of it give your heart to the lord now live for him because the life that's coming is a very long one hallelujah that's the one we're aiming at friends that's the one i'm encouraging you to believe in today make your life count for that life this life means very little only what you do for god even lasts it has no other purpose but to prepare you and train you for the next world and that's why i say this life is not even about this life it's only about the next one coming you know we have so many counterfeits and and but but but you know sometimes uh i i use as as a lead-in i sometimes i'll use that as a lead-in line you know witnessing to somebody to talk about counterfeits because i love that brother branham was such a simple man that he he'd put forth these little anecdotal things and you just kind of go hmm wow i mean you can't even argue with it it's just too shallow it's too simple he just hit his talk you know he'd hit he'd talk about you know you know if you if you see the cows you know laying under the tree just laying in the shade and you know doing what cows do and he said they're just laying there he said line out of the water boys you ain't going to catch nothing because if they're not eating the fish ain't eating because all nature runs in continuity and you want to you want to come in here and argue with william branham against the seventh seal and he just hits you with that take your water out of the line you're not gonna catch any fish you're like okay but that's true he's making a very simple point making a very simple point and and i and sometimes i would talk about counterfeits and brother branham would just say just as simple as anything oh you know people say oh you know all the hypocrites all the all the all the falsity in the christian church and brother branham would say well you can't really have a counterfeit unless you got a reel and it's like yeah i mean it's it's an inarguable point the counterfeit couldn't exist there's no such thing as a counterfeit three dollar bill in american currency anyway because there's never been a corresponding real one you understand and so the very so watch the very fact that there is a counterfeit proves without ever seeing it it proves there's a real somewhere with all the counterfeits you know but but i like to say to somebody yeah the world is filled with counterfeits but hey what if you could have something that was back to the original again what do you want that what if you could have something that could really make this book come alive in your home and in your life and in your children and then people start wow they've never you realize that in mass friends people in churches today they're they're preaching from empty wells they're firing blanks as brother ernie says you give them just a little bit of the revealed word and it's it's like astonishing to people don't hesitate i'm here to tell you something today you know not you do not have to back up every teaching in this message is incontrovertibly proven in the bible it's that you can't contend with it because it's from genesis to revelation tell somebody about it don't be afraid study it learn it you have the words of eternal life to give out you have back to the original again that you're not offering them a counterfeit you're offering them something that can reproduce the original the bible and i'm i'm going to run out of time here quickly let me come to a second thought that's included in this and it's inescapable you know the bible and we won't take the time to i'd slow myself down and i've just got a few minutes left and i'll i'll enlarge on this so i'm just going to touch it today and we're going to close the bible talks about people who will forsake the truth at the end time that what you see happening doesn't catch god off guard at all and shouldn't even by any means amaze you the scripture is very clear and i'll go into the scriptures with you next time that it that just that the language is so descriptive you almost get a visual of people who've done it it's so accurate that they actually turn around and begin to oppose it and actually they don't just leave it saying i can't live it you know and that's that's not a the end of the world because brother branham said hey i would much rather face god as a sinner than face him as a hypocrite say don't whatever you do don't be a hypocrite if if you don't got the real goods fall at an altar and talk it over with god you have a right you have a divine right every child of god brother ram says has a god-given right to have a conference with god nobody can deny you that no devil can stop that you understand it's given to you a divine right when you were born built in the image of god you have a right to have a conference with god you don't need a pass an invitation you don't need a code you don't need nothing you you no passphrase you you you have the right to go to your knees bow your head humbly approach the maker of the whole universe you have the privilege to a direct audience say how would you like to get in to see the pope what a secretary why would i want to go see that i want to go see the main man he's not even a good secretary [Laughter] takes all the credit himself man give me the give me the real person you have access to that and the bible talks about how that this will take place in numerous places and that's why i'm not going to try to go down the trail of the scriptures today but as it comes on down it talks and then it changes gears and the apostle starts talking to the church about make sure that you have fervent love one for another that that that element of love is going to be paramount you just don't know how paramount that you have that fervent love i'm gonna tell you something friends as this thing gets darker and darker and you say it can't possibly get darker oh it it can it can get monumentally darker we don't know what all we'll have to face we're still in the middle of a global pandemic we don't know what tomorrow holds i i remember saying to you at the very beginning of this thing hey when this one's over there'll be five more behind that one and when those five there'll be ten more behind that one the world's burning down it's the end of all things brother branham says don't even bother writing new history books ain't going to be nobody around to read them we're going home friends hallelujah it's homegoing time and i'm so thrilled to be a part of it i'm so glad it's come in my generation say oh i'd like to have an easier generation well how would you define easier what what what's what's your definition of great i want to come into the most perfect image of god to me that's the greatest grandest most a wonderful privilege that i could ever hope for is that i get the opportunity to become just like jesus christ and i don't even have to worry about being able to do it he's doing it through me by the word that i'm feeding on and you can rely on the word it is working i'm here to tell you it's working he's doing more in you than you know and here we are oh my and and sure enough now they've already got one that's even more contagious and they're hoping against hope that that the vaccine they won't have to start from scratch that this vaccine will well uh head that one off too and it's much more contagious than the one that already seems like enormously contagious and what do you where's your goals what do you hope to accomplish by staying right i mean why would i want to own buy a house that's burning down you think you can i could convince you to do that and yet the devil has a lot of success in convincing us and invest more in this world invest more in this world why when i go in front of the mirror i think i'm okay until i walk by the mirror and go oh let me see oh man wow i need to make some changes let the word do that to you could i give you that advice today let the word do that to you stand in front of it read it it's a mirror it'll show don't whatever you do don't make the mistake that the apostle warned us about by saying people come into church and they hear the word of god preached and it shows them really who they are and what manner of man they are and where their deficits are and where their problems are and they rejoice in it while they're under that atmosphere do you know why that's not that's not accidental do you know why that happens because the preaching of the gospel drives back demons the preaching of the gospel cast out devils you can come in this into this building with your mind set on being a sinner and hear the word of god preach and suddenly you're not sure if you should be that's not an accident that's magic that's supernatural see that's real man that's not harry potter magic that's real magic you understand it drives back spirits of unbelief so that then the holy spirit can come and start dealing with your heart he's not going to stand there and put up with the devil he's going to drive him back he the holy spirit's going to going to say to the preacher and it might not even be in the preacher's notes and the holy spirit's going to go going to cast a a scripture into his mind and give him an inspiration and he'll leave his notes and start preaching why is that happening because god's fighting a devil for your life and he's standing there and the devil's trying to resist it and god turns to his servant says preach this say the out of the bible and the preacher comes off of his notes and you never know a thing about it and he starts preaching under inspiration and that demon starts getting driven back because you start believing it and god starts pouring it on i say pour it on lord pour it on lord pour it on lord that's what the power of the gospel is to do is to drive away demon spirits the mistake comes when after god does that and you don't see it it's happening in a dimension you can't see but it's happening demons howling and screaming it's happening the holy spirit running them off out of your life it's happening what happens is the apostles said then you get up you get dismissed in jesus name the song leader sings a few more songs while the people slowly trickle out and you go right out that door and the bible says and you forget the kind of man that the word showed you you really were and you get thinking i'm okay and those and the holy spirit just says well and those demons come right back along yeah buddy you're fine come on man you didn't need all that anyway let that demon keep doing that and he will come on buddy all the way to hell that's where he's trying to take you but you don't have to go there i'm so glad that god rich in mercy made a way for you understand this principle friends god will never send a man to hell who don't want to go and i don't want to go there i want to i look at the stars i'm like david i look at those galaxies and all those auroras and i look at those nebulas and i i just say that vast expanse and i want to be a part of that kingdom i know that's going to be used someday lord i want to be a part of it i don't want this shallow little life here this life let them have whatever they chase it chase it jason go ahead but not me not me i'm i'm chasing this i'm chasing eternal life i've seen the greatest sign that the world should ever see it's become a part of me [Music] that divine love is going to be so important because and i'm going to say this and close i i got to stop come on back matt bring your team let me just make this couple of comments i'll enlarge on this don't think you won't get the whole seven course meal on it because the lord's still cooking it this is a little appetizer i just want to say this and we'll stop whatever you're choosing son the bible say why why would the why would the apostle go to all this trouble to describe men in the end time turning away and doing this and doing that and everything turning upside down and then he would like flip the script and go now you're going to need this fervent love because say does the bible say that yes it does and the bible also says that in the last days some a lot of things are going to happen in the last days that have that are not unique in history but they're unique in the fact that they're going to be amplified to a level they've never been amplified where men will be heady and high-minded traitors see lovers of self more than lovers of god and so now here comes the apostle to say when you start seeing all of this turmoil happening you're going to need fervent love because the world is going to love itself and this is what this is what makes you stumble anytime you stumble you stumble i stumble come on we stumble thank god for the blood but why do you stumble because you're loving yourself more you've got that thing that you like you want to do it you're enticed by it and you know it's contrary to god's word but you do it anyway you know what you just did you loved yourself more than you loved his word because his word told you don't do that you're almost home lay aside the weights and sins but i kind of like that sin that and that weight you know we're pretty pretty good friends no lay aside because you're you're at the point of a race now where you can't walk anymore you have to run you have to run you cross the finish line you need to be running parents are ineffective parents because they love themselves more than their children i'm not trying to come to the end of my sermon and lock you all down i just want to say that that happens parents are not always effective as they need to be because they put their own desires above the needs of training up their children in the way that they should go and if and if you're like that you never had kids and if you were never going to have kids you should never got married that's truth stop loving yourself start loving his word so i'm going to make this choice for my life well if it's a choice if it's an opportunity god has given you take it goodness well he'll bless you in it make sure it's his word but don't love yourself so much that you take it and you kind of you won't go look in the mirror on that anymore because you know if you looked in that mirror you go um wow brother branham said people would do that memory preachers he said preachers who sit in their study and they come across a scripture that talk about these signs shall follow that believer they come across the scripture baptizing in jesus name and brother branham said quickly they turn the page because they they don't want to read what's there let me get over here okay i can read this don't do god like that don't do his word like that you you've not only seen the greatest sign that was to strike the world you are the greatest sign [Music] absolutely i could there's so much more i want to say on that but i'm going to stop let's stand have fervent love one for another friends this is the hour where we're going to need it is the hour of perfect faith that could only come because god gave us a perfect word the greatest sign i i wish i could persuade the whole world you know i guess god hasn't given me the burden like he gave a prophet to persuade the whole world i just wish i could persuade this whole city that god has placed me in to say come into the doors at 2608 mossy oaks road i want to show you the greatest sign of the end time right here they are people living impossibly living standards that are impossible to live except god is doing it through it's too outside the mainstream it's too off the beaten path but i'm here to tell you that's the way god's family has always been amen i want you to bow your heads with me and i'm just trying to feel my way along how to even end this service but bow your heads with me lord i you see my heart you know the my i mean lord you know my own personal struggles and then on top of that to try to get my mind around this burden of the

them know that your life has a purpose behind it you're not just killing time you're not just trying to serve your own interest you're serving his i want to before we go uh we had a special prayer request come in last night and you know in one sense it's a sad thing because it's the departing of a loved one but brother brad's mother passed away last night and she's been sick and she was elderly it's not wasn't unexpected but you know brother brad he said to me he said brother jason he said i've been witnessing to them for 33 years and you know i i felt like in my heart i only had one possible response to that i said brother brad i would hold that faith in my heart till the day i died and i said brother baby said you take that faith to your grave even if you never see it happen he said on resurrection morning he said that faith will still be burning in your heart and god will have to answer to it then aren't you glad for that and i said brother you believe it you that's not a battle i have my mother's long ago uh given her heart to the lord but here's here's here's brother brad my mother's long ago been a believer here's brother brad believing for more than three decades and then see his mother depart and even the last couple of years and slipping away slowly but how many will pray for our brother today now there's no no need to pray for her she's gone on but i want to pray for his faith i want i want brother brad to feel the promise of the holy spirit i want him to feel the surety of the word of god to say i have not run in vain i have not prayed in vain i have not believed in vain how many will do it and you think now what i want you to do i want you to put brother brad's image in your mind as we pray because i don't i don't it's it's you know when god keeps a promise like this where are you going to find sadness in it i mean you know there's i remember saying to a young woman one time she wasn't sure about her mother and in fact is it it looked for all practical purposes that wouldn't be a whole lot of hope there but this girl was a christian and i said sister we're not talking about basing something on her inheritance you don't have any but you do so you've got an inheritance use your own inheritance and say lord i said i'm tell you right now if this was my mama and she was on deathbed dying as an unbeliever i said i'd claim her immediately i wouldn't even blink think twice pass go do nothing i'd make a claim i'd raise my hand to god and say i claim her as my reward all based on my inheritance for god's kingdom somewhere at some level somehow i'm going to tell you i believed it then that was almost 20 plus years ago i believe it today even more so i have a vested interest actually in believing that how about you let's bow our heads before we go [Music] father i i hope that something that i've said and i believe it i i don't just hope it i actually believe lord that brother brad is receiving the strength of the word and the promise of god's word they got to take a journey lord he just came back from a journey and sister rebecca there's been sadness in that family so lord as as his extended church family we're lifting them up before you for strength today we're lifting them up before you for faith today lord we're believing father that you'll go with them on this journey provide for their needs lord uh and and and above all things may our brother go into an atmosphere where there no doubt be sadness and darkness and let him go in as a beaming light of hope in god's word and god's promise and be able to show and demonstrate by his own testimony that there is a god in you and he's worthy of being believed he's worthy of having his word accepted may you grant it to them lord keep them safe we know they'll they'll be out for a little bit dealing with this father we're we're asking you to keep them safe we're asking you to meet their needs father i pray according to your riches in glory lord what an a what a day that we're living for when when we'll all be together again around father's throne that that's what helps me when i looked at the picture that 10 year old little boy thought my goodness from that from that snapshot of history when the camera flashed what did he do after that did he stand up and walk away and rejoin his friends yeah no doubt and then he turned 11 and then 15 and then 20. he met a woman he got mad he went in the navy come out met a woman got married raised a family witness to people became a believer one whole church's little 10 year old boy who would have thought when entire churches to this glorious message starting a missionary program to to his to his home region there that his wife continues to this day with some success i might add [Music] here we have no continuing city but we seek one actively seek one to come i don't want to be on the sidelines lord i don't want us to have a passive faith i want to have an act of faith that believes every word of god i commit it now to you and commit all the words that were said today commit the whole campbell family into your hands oh that day when we all gather around a family circle will be unbroken gather around father's throne it'll be worth it it'll be worth it we'll stand there and we won't have one regret in our life will say it was worth it to run this race i commit this audience into your hand lord for however many more this is the first sunday of the new year however many more we have well we'll be right here we'll still be believing it still be preaching it still be living it still be
