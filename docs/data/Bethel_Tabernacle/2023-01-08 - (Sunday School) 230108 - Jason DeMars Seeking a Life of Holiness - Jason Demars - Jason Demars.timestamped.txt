[0:01] gracious father we come before you now
[0:03] Lord and we ask that your Holy Spirit
[0:04] would be amongst us this morning Lord
[0:07] that you would take your word and speak
[0:08] it into our hearts
[0:10] Lord we ask you to be Sovereign and in
[0:12] total control of our thoughts and our
[0:14] hearts Lord and
[0:16] just just move in the way that you
[0:19] choose to do so Lord we commit ourselves
[0:21] to you we ask these things in Jesus name
[0:23] amen
[0:25] I want to look at the subject seeking a
[0:28] life of holiness
[0:30] and the first scripture I want to look
[0:32] at is Hebrews 12 verse 14.
[0:41] follow peace with all men
[0:43] and Holiness without which no man shall
[0:47] see the Lord amen may the Lord add the
[0:50] blessing to the reading of his word he
[0:51] could be seated
[0:55] follow peace with all men so this is
[0:57] Paul's instruction follow peace with all
[0:59] men now
[1:01] Jesus says similar the blessed are the
[1:04] peacemakers
[1:06] Paul says live at peace
[1:10] with all men in so much as it is
[1:13] possible
[1:15] so right there you see immediately Paul
[1:17] puts a caveat on living at peace there
[1:20] are some people they will not live at
[1:22] peace with you
[1:24] there's no con there's no compromise on
[1:26] their part to live to live in a
[1:29] Peaceable way you know if you read that
[1:31] in uh Rome I forget what chapter of
[1:35] Romans but I think it's Romans 12. Paul
[1:38] says that and then he gives instructions
[1:40] uh if someone does evil to you don't
[1:42] repay
[1:44] evil for good but repay good for evil
[1:48] you know
[1:49] if you have an enemy
[1:51] feed them you know clothe them etc etc
[1:55] this is how we live at peace with all
[1:57] men
[1:58] because those are things that pursue
[2:01] peace like if somebody has a need and
[2:03] you go to meet it you're pursuing you're
[2:06] going after peace you know you could
[2:08] just say follow peace with all men and
[2:10] you'd be a good politician because all
[2:12] you did was compromise on everything you
[2:15] didn't care about what was true what was
[2:16] right you're just seeking after
[2:19] compromise compromise compromise by no
[2:22] means is that what Jesus or Paul are
[2:24] trying to encourage us to follow after
[2:27] and and I love that he puts right there
[2:29] follow peace with all men and Holiness
[2:32] many times
[2:34] uh seeking a life of Holiness is in
[2:37] conflict
[2:39] with being at peace with everyone think
[2:41] about that just in your own family
[2:43] when you're seeking to live a set apart
[2:46] life and the drinks are coming out and
[2:48] the pool parties you're being invited to
[2:51] and these different things you love them
[2:53] you you love your family and then you go
[2:55] to the party and they say oh here why
[2:58] aren't you why aren't your kids going in
[3:00] the pool with everybody why aren't you
[3:02] doing this
[3:03] well peace doesn't pursue with an answer
[3:06] of Truth
[3:08] well we that's that's not something that
[3:10] we engage in what in the world you guys
[3:13] are nuts
[3:14] and so
[3:16] we don't follow peace
[3:19] sacrificing holiness
[3:22] and again
[3:23] it's it's sad where we've come to but in
[3:26] our in our day and age even the word
[3:28] Holiness many times we go
[3:32] we are almost we have a reaction inside
[3:35] of us like oh that's fanaticism and
[3:38] that's crazy and that's the that's the
[3:40] devil
[3:42] that's absolutely the devil
[3:44] Paul says follow peace with all men and
[3:47] Holiness so he's follow peace and
[3:49] Holiness follow
[3:51] so follow what does he mean does it mean
[3:54] that Holiness is going and you're
[3:56] following in one sense sure but actually
[3:58] what that word follow means is to pursue
[4:03] or press towards
[4:06] holiness
[4:08] so this isn't pressing towards
[4:10] self-righteousness
[4:12] it's not pressing towards spiritual
[4:14] Pride
[4:16] it's not pressing towards your
[4:18] achievement to get right with God you
[4:21] know we
[4:22] spoke on I spoke on Wednesday night so
[4:25] much about the sovereignty of God
[4:27] everything that you go through
[4:28] everything God has ordained that there
[4:32] even even the mistakes and the sins that
[4:35] you make God has purposed them for an
[4:39] eternal purpose their mistakes their
[4:41] sins they go against God's word and
[4:43] there's
[4:44] there there are consequences for those
[4:47] things and yet God has ordained those
[4:50] things as such however you can take that
[4:54] and you can go a million miles in the
[4:56] wrong direction brother Jason's
[4:58] encouraging us to sin
[5:00] and do just live any kind of sinful
[5:03] lifestyle
[5:04] and that's a huge mistake that people
[5:06] that believe in predestination have made
[5:09] historically
[5:11] um
[5:12] living
[5:14] Living the Life of Christ I mean that's
[5:17] what it means to be elect means that you
[5:20] have the life of God inside of you
[5:24] quickened by the Holy Ghost so what is
[5:27] going to follow
[5:29] a sinful life is God's sinful
[5:32] no so what's going to follow
[5:34] a life of Holiness be holy
[5:39] for I am Holy
[5:42] and many times we we look at that word
[5:44] and so many
[5:46] thoughts can pop into our head and
[5:48] depending on maybe you were raised in
[5:51] the message maybe you were raised in a
[5:52] church that uh was out of balance was
[5:55] was seeking after self-righteousness was
[5:58] was uh
[6:00] harming people with their with their
[6:03] zeal
[6:05] uh foolish Zeal for God
[6:08] not a Zeal according to knowledge but
[6:10] Azeal in ignorance and and foolishness
[6:13] and perhaps you hear the word Holiness
[6:17] then you shudder in fear like what is he
[6:21] you're telling us to seek a life of
[6:23] Holiness yeah
[6:26] work if you have
[6:28] Christ Living in you
[6:30] you will pursue you will press towards a
[6:34] life of Holiness because there is a life
[6:37] inside of you
[6:39] pressing towards a life of holiness
[6:42] and we don't want to be guilty in our
[6:45] understanding of election and
[6:47] predestination and the sovereignty of
[6:48] God that we're looking at it that it
[6:51] doesn't matter
[6:52] what mistakes that I make it doesn't
[6:54] matter what sins I make now you can you
[6:57] can understand that scripturally because
[6:59] by the blood we've never even sinned in
[7:02] the first place
[7:04] that's what the blood was shed for us to
[7:07] bring us to that condition
[7:09] and yet that doesn't give us a license
[7:12] to sin
[7:14] Paul said shall we sin that Grace May
[7:17] abound God forbid
[7:20] God forbid Grace comes to bring a change
[7:23] to bring a transformation so you know
[7:26] you you take the opposite if you're not
[7:29] seeking a life of holiness
[7:33] then there's a question mark on is the
[7:35] life of God dwelling in you
[7:39] right so if you're if you're just living
[7:41] ungodly sinful you might be really good
[7:45] at hiding it and and concealing it if
[7:47] you're living in that way
[7:49] it's not the life of Christ inside of
[7:51] you
[7:52] and so
[7:53] this is this is critical and important
[7:56] to get these things in Balance because
[7:58] on the one hand you have
[7:59] self-righteousness and achieving your
[8:01] salvation on the other hand you you have
[8:05] the life of God transforming you
[8:07] bringing you to that
[8:08] this is this is what we're talking about
[8:10] when we're talking about seeking a life
[8:12] of holiness
[8:14] also with a remembrance and an
[8:17] understanding
[8:18] of where you came from who you are what
[8:20] you what condition you were born in what
[8:23] you can achieve on your own
[8:25] do you have an understanding do you have
[8:27] a good understanding of what you've
[8:28] achieved on your own
[8:31] Isaiah 64 6 tells us
[8:35] but we are all as an unclean thing
[8:39] and all our righteousness are as filthy
[8:42] rags
[8:43] and we all do Fade as a leaf and our
[8:47] iniquities like the wind have taken us
[8:49] away
[8:50] we are all
[8:52] we are all
[8:54] that's everyone
[8:57] every single one of us are born in this
[9:00] condition and therefore what are we
[9:02] worthy of death
[9:04] and Hell
[9:06] so you and your own self-achievement
[9:08] even religious self-achievement
[9:11] you're impure and you're filthy
[9:14] and you're worthy of death and hell
[9:17] that's the condition that you're born
[9:19] in
[9:21] so it takes God's work in you not your
[9:25] own work
[9:26] not your own achievement you can't take
[9:28] a filthy Rag and wipe something clean
[9:31] with it you just
[9:32] it might look clean you think oh that
[9:35] looks clean it's full of bacteria and
[9:38] viruses and so forth and you're wiping
[9:40] it down and he's man I got such a clean
[9:42] clean house oh I didn't clean it you're
[9:45] going to kill somebody with that
[9:47] that's got a sickness on it and so we we
[9:51] have to guard
[9:54] against that super religious message fig
[9:58] leaf that we can put over ourselves and
[10:01] say hey I got it figured out I'm I'm
[10:04] doing well my life is this my life is
[10:06] that
[10:07] no it's not about you it's about what
[10:10] Christ has done
[10:13] Romans 8 13.
[10:19] for if you live after the flesh
[10:22] you shall die
[10:24] but if ye through the spirit do mortify
[10:27] the Deeds of the body ye shall live I
[10:30] love how Paul does this he does this so
[10:32] many different times and you read it and
[10:33] if you just read that out of the entire
[10:36] context of Romans 8 you would have this
[10:38] idea
[10:39] okay if I want to have eternal life I've
[10:42] got to put to death
[10:44] The Works of my body I have to do it
[10:48] well number one is that's not what it
[10:50] says it says through the spirit
[10:54] there is no therefore now no
[10:56] condemnation to them that are in Christ
[10:59] Jesus who walk not after the flesh but
[11:02] after the spirit this is the foundation
[11:04] of Romans 8 13.
[11:07] you're not living your own life you
[11:09] don't live by the faith of Jason Demars
[11:11] you live by the faith of the son of God
[11:14] right so then that life his life is
[11:17] inside of you
[11:19] so what's taking what's then taking
[11:21] place is the spirit inside of you is
[11:23] putting to death mortify means to kill
[11:28] to kill or to become dead or put to
[11:31] death
[11:33] so you're putting to death the Deeds of
[11:36] the body and in other words what is he
[11:38] saying if you're elect if you have the
[11:41] holy spirit inside of you the holy
[11:44] spirit is doing a work in you to put to
[11:48] death The Works of the body
[11:50] again this is perfect scriptural balance
[11:54] the perfect balance because
[11:56] you can say well I have the spirit I
[11:59] believe
[12:01] well
[12:03] the Devils believe also and tremble
[12:05] and tremble many of us don't even
[12:08] tremble sad sad to say we're so
[12:10] lackadaisical with our understanding of
[12:13] God's grace and mercy we have no
[12:16] understanding of his his judgment and
[12:18] his Wrath
[12:22] so that's the question that's the
[12:24] question you say I'm elect
[12:26] is the holy spirit working in me
[12:29] to kill
[12:30] The Works of the flesh the Deeds of the
[12:33] body
[12:34] okay if the holy spirit is doing that
[12:36] work in you you'll live
[12:39] but if that's not what's happening
[12:40] you're living your if your life can be
[12:42] described as a life In the Flesh you're
[12:45] dead
[12:46] you're dead while you're living
[12:49] Colossians 1 3 1-5 Colossians 3 1-5
[12:58] if ye then
[13:00] be risen with Christ
[13:02] seek those things which are above
[13:06] right so this is
[13:09] this is the CR this is to the Christian
[13:11] if
[13:12] if Paul puts it as if again
[13:15] why did you put it as if
[13:18] because it's it's continually bringing
[13:22] that scriptural balance is
[13:24] if you say you have faith you profess
[13:28] Faith okay
[13:30] if you're risen with Christ
[13:33] then seek those things that are above
[13:35] where Christ sits on the right hand of
[13:37] God
[13:39] verse 2 set your affections on things
[13:42] above
[13:43] not on things on the earth when we're
[13:45] talking about seeking a life of Holiness
[13:48] it has to go into this level
[13:52] what is your affection
[13:54] or desire
[13:56] let's talk about it in that sense what
[13:58] is your desire your the Holy Spirit
[14:02] brings a nature change right
[14:05] so then what then that change when the
[14:07] nature changes the desire and the
[14:10] affection changes
[14:12] so what do you Delight in what what are
[14:16] you what is if someone saw your life
[14:18] they didn't know you from anything and
[14:19] they started examining what's happening
[14:21] what would they say
[14:24] his affections are on things above or
[14:27] his affections are on things on the
[14:28] earth his desire and his passion
[14:30] is here on Earth
[14:36] or is it on Christ
[14:39] is in is it in the place where Christ is
[14:41] sitting at the right hand of God
[14:44] all right four
[14:47] again Paul is so good for these types of
[14:49] types of words verse three
[14:52] four
[14:53] you are dead and your life is hid with
[14:57] Christ in God
[15:00] if you're if you're a real Christian
[15:03] baptized in the Holy Spirit then you're
[15:05] dead
[15:07] and your life is hid with Christ and God
[15:10] and these other things follow your
[15:12] affections are on things above you're
[15:14] seeking the things where Christ is
[15:16] sitting at the right hand of God
[15:18] verse 4 when Christ who is our life
[15:21] shall appear
[15:23] then shall ye also appear with him in
[15:26] glory amen this is a promise if you're
[15:28] in Christ you will appear with him in
[15:31] glory
[15:35] mortify
[15:37] therefore
[15:38] your members which are upon the Earth
[15:41] fornication uncleanness inordinate
[15:44] affection evil concupiscience
[15:46] covetousness which is idolatry
[15:51] mortify in this version of the Greek
[15:54] word means to deaden or to subdue
[15:58] so
[15:59] a Christian is in the process
[16:02] as long as you're here on the Earth
[16:05] you're in the process
[16:07] whether you're young middle-aged or old
[16:10] you're in the process of putting to
[16:13] death your flesh your members which are
[16:17] upon the earth that is what Christians
[16:19] do
[16:20] look at it look at it that way
[16:23] that is what Christians do they seek
[16:26] pursue they press towards that life of
[16:29] holiness
[16:31] in the sermon 1961 perfect strength by
[16:34] Perfect weakness brother Branham says
[16:36] every person
[16:37] that professes to be a Christian will
[16:40] forget his own ability and yield himself
[16:43] to God
[16:45] then God can achieve his purpose by
[16:47] sending not a Revival but brother what
[16:50] he needs to do first is send a killing
[16:52] that's right so we can revive you have
[16:55] to die before you're born again
[16:58] and you have to he needs this a killing
[17:00] of ourselves this Tabernacle needs a
[17:03] killing and me with it all of us we need
[17:05] a killing so that we can be revived in a
[17:08] new life a new hold a New Hope a new
[17:10] experience
[17:11] we need first a day of mourning
[17:15] morning like sorrow
[17:18] we need a place of yielding to the
[17:20] spirit instead of so much depending upon
[17:22] schooling and Upon Our programs and our
[17:24] campaigns and all that we have
[17:26] we rely upon cooperation with so many
[17:29] different ministers to cooperate if we
[17:32] can't get so many why we won't do it we
[17:34] won't go to the cities without that and
[17:36] then when we do that we're making it in
[17:38] a great big machine that's got a carbon
[17:40] knock in it we've got to get away from
[17:43] that that human ability
[17:45] we got to get to a place where we can
[17:47] surrender our souls and lives even to
[17:50] the housewife to the farmer to the
[17:51] mechanic or whoever you are we got to
[17:54] surrender completely to God and know
[17:57] that we are nothing
[17:59] then let God start from there
[18:02] then he starts moving working and that
[18:05] includes all of us everyone amen
[18:09] do you ever find yourself in a place
[18:10] where you feel like uh your your faith
[18:15] is weak and and you're not on fire for
[18:18] God and you wonder what happened
[18:20] brother Branham just gave you
[18:23] the formula
[18:25] of where to start and then where to go
[18:27] to
[18:28] where do we start you've got to die to
[18:31] yourself
[18:32] and then you've got to surrender
[18:35] everything to the Lord completely to him
[18:38] and know that you are nothing then let
[18:42] God start from there
[18:44] it's like a clean slate okay all of this
[18:49] has happened in my Christian Life up to
[18:51] this point
[18:52] so what all my righteousness is as
[18:55] filthy rags Lord
[18:58] I'm nothing
[18:59] I'm I'm laying aside my thoughts my
[19:03] desires and everything that's where God
[19:06] starts to move from
[19:08] and when we say God knows if we've laid
[19:11] aside everything and put everything in
[19:13] front of him and said Lord everything's
[19:15] on the table whatever you whatever you
[19:17] need to correct me on whatever you need
[19:19] to deal with me on it's not as though we
[19:21] say deal with me on everything but my
[19:23] video games are uh over outside of that
[19:27] my my TV never mind
[19:31] what I watch on the TV that's up to me
[19:34] and this and no we just say Lord
[19:36] everything
[19:37] it's on the table if something's coming
[19:39] between me and you
[19:41] let me not be attached to that at all
[19:43] and just let go of that and give it to
[19:46] the Lord that's what I'm talking about
[19:48] when we're talking about a start
[19:50] many times we've you've heard it
[19:52] preached over and over again that the
[19:54] devil will corrupt you little by little
[19:58] he doesn't offer you
[20:01] uh a filthy movie to start with when
[20:05] you're what when you're walking closely
[20:06] with Christ and you're surrendered to
[20:09] him because he knows you'll just be
[20:10] repelled so he offers you a little thing
[20:13] it's oh it's it's not too bad that
[20:16] show's not too bad that's that movie's
[20:18] not so bad and step by step
[20:22] you're Galloping down poison
[20:25] little by little
[20:27] and that's the danger and so
[20:30] that's that's what we're talking about
[20:31] here
[20:32] let's get to a place where we surrender
[20:35] all of our lives
[20:37] to him and sometimes we have to
[20:39] re-surrender
[20:40] daily
[20:42] we got to re-surrender all that we are
[20:44] to him
[20:46] and know that we're nothing and then let
[20:48] God start from there
[20:52] First Peter 1 15.
[20:58] but as he which called you hath called
[21:00] you is Holy
[21:01] so be ye holy in all manner of
[21:05] conversation speaking of your conduct
[21:09] God is Holy we never really Define this
[21:12] to start up and I was purposeful what
[21:15] does it mean to be
[21:17] holy
[21:19] ultimately mean it means to be set aside
[21:22] we understand though it carries even
[21:24] more than that means cleansed
[21:27] and set aside
[21:29] for God's service
[21:32] apart sacred these are some of the
[21:34] different things is
[21:36] you're you could switch it around and
[21:39] say you're not normal
[21:42] you're you're different
[21:44] that's what we're called we're not
[21:45] called to be normal we're not called to
[21:48] be like everybody else we're called to
[21:51] be like God be holy for I am Holy
[21:55] right that's the next verse verse 16.
[21:58] God is Holy so we should be holy why why
[22:00] is that
[22:02] God is different than us right
[22:04] sure you're called to be imitators of
[22:07] God
[22:08] you're you're called to be the
[22:11] expression of His Image if God is Holy
[22:14] you're his image what is his image going
[22:16] to be
[22:18] holy set apart for him not a set apart
[22:21] for partially for God partially for my
[22:24] own purposes partially for the devil no
[22:27] completely set apart for God
[22:30] completely laid us aside for him
[22:34] this doesn't give us room to justify
[22:37] ourselves in our own sight
[22:39] we we can come up with very the devil
[22:43] speaking to us can come up with
[22:44] elaborate logical reasonings
[22:48] to approve ourselves in our own eyes
[22:53] that's not what we're talking about
[22:56] we're called over and over again it says
[22:58] called to be Saints what does saint mean
[23:03] what does saint mean
[23:04] anybody
[23:06] sanctified
[23:08] a holy one that's what it's called to be
[23:11] called to be holy ones or Sanctified
[23:15] ones holy ones holy and sanctify is the
[23:18] same word same root word one just speaks
[23:21] of a person one speaks of a thing
[23:25] you're a Holy One
[23:29] so this should lead us
[23:32] to a life of self-examination Before the
[23:36] Throne of God
[23:38] then when it leads us to that kind of
[23:40] life we're talking about a life of
[23:42] Holiness we're not talking about
[23:45] religious Works religious Behavior you
[23:49] guys can can look the part of the
[23:52] message you all know
[23:55] what to do and what not to do you all
[23:57] know how to put push the envelope a
[23:59] little bit
[24:00] we're not we're not stupid we're not
[24:02] dummies
[24:05] we know we know and that that's looking
[24:09] at life through the lens of
[24:11] what do other people think
[24:15] what what is so-and-so going to think
[24:17] what is so-and-so going to think I can't
[24:18] do this because of this this and this
[24:20] that's not what we live our lives for we
[24:23] live our lives to be pleasing to the
[24:25] Lord
[24:26] and that starts with a life we don't
[24:29] you're not justifying yourself in your
[24:30] own eyes
[24:32] and for sure not trying to justify
[24:35] yourself to everybody else
[24:37] and we live that life of
[24:39] self-examination Before the Throne of
[24:41] God which then leads us to live a life
[24:43] of
[24:45] humility and Brokenness before the Lord
[24:49] that that that is that uh Earnest desire
[24:54] and Earnest passion that we're seeking
[24:57] god with
[24:59] I believe every Christian
[25:01] should have an earnest
[25:04] passion and desire that they're seeking
[25:07] after God
[25:09] not just
[25:11] well we go to church we do this I do my
[25:15] devotions check it off the list I got my
[25:17] checklist and I finished the checklist
[25:19] no it's a love affair with Christ
[25:24] and it's a passion that you have for
[25:26] Christ and this passion is birth in I
[25:29] want to be like him I want to live like
[25:31] him I don't care what other people are
[25:33] doing around me I'm seeking and
[25:35] following after him and I'm you know
[25:38] that right there will humble us because
[25:40] we know we can achieve it on our own we
[25:43] can't follow that in our own efforts
[25:48] it's a life that follows hard
[25:51] after the word
[25:53] and a life that is pursuing Lord cleanse
[25:57] me
[25:58] from all worldliness ungodliness and
[26:01] anything contrary to the word take that
[26:04] out of me
[26:06] it's not trying to live I'm trying to
[26:08] live up to an image so everybody
[26:11] thinks
[26:12] I'm okay and I'm a good guy it can
[26:16] easily become that
[26:17] and it does world over in churches
[26:21] that's not what we need to be about
[26:24] it needs to be a personal walk with him
[26:29] that bursts itself in a humility and an
[26:32] Earnest passion and desire for more of
[26:35] him and living more like him
[26:39] not just talking about that not just
[26:41] living that
[26:44] Lord give us that passion
[26:47] and that fire because it has to come
[26:49] from him
[26:51] I'm not telling you this so you go out
[26:53] and achieve it
[26:55] you can't
[26:56] you can ask the Lord
[26:58] that's what I'm telling you to do ask
[27:01] the Lord to give you that heart if your
[27:03] desires aren't right if your passion
[27:05] isn't right say Lord
[27:07] my desire My Passion my Pursuits are not
[27:11] right
[27:12] correct me cleanse me
[27:15] make my desires right make my passions
[27:17] right make my burdens right and he'll do
[27:20] it that's what this is about
[27:23] recognize don't be afraid
[27:26] to recognize your own weakness
[27:28] Don't Be Afraid Don't Be Afraid don't be
[27:30] so proud of yourself that you have to
[27:33] put an image I'm strong I'm this I'm
[27:36] super me I'm the super messaging
[27:39] believer come on man

[27:50] skirt it to the world

[27:55] father

[28:00] be considered a good message believer

[28:14] coming to the Altar and getting on your
[28:15] knees and repenting it's not about
