[46:02] All those lonely roads that I have
[46:05] traveled on,
[46:09] there was Jesus.
[46:17] When the life I built came crashing to
[46:21] the ground.
[46:24] When the friends I had were nowhere to
[46:28] be found.
[46:32] I couldn't see.
[46:34] But I can see it now.
[46:39] There was Jesus.
[46:47] In the waiting, in the searching, in the
[46:51] healing and the hurting, like a blessing
[46:56] buried in the broken pieces.
[47:02] every minute, every moment, where I've
[47:06] been, and where I'm going. Even when I
[47:11] didn't know it or couldn't see it,
[47:15] there was Jesus
[47:22] [Music]
[47:24] with this man who needs amazing kind of
[47:28] grace.
[47:32] for forgiveness at a price I couldn't
[47:36] pay.

[47:43] day.
[47:44] [Music]
[47:46] There was Jesus
[47:51] [Music]
[47:54] in the waiting, in the search, in the
[47:58] healing and the hurting.
[48:02] Like a blessing buried in the broken
[48:06] pieces.

[50:17] [Music]
[50:29] One dark night in Egypt,
[50:35] a fearful time had come
[50:40] for one little Hebrew boy.
[50:45] He was his father's firstborn son.
[50:50] And with the angel of death
[50:54] passing low, it was hard to fall asleep.
[51:01] For one little lamb stood in his mind.
[51:06] As he laid there
[51:09] counting sheep,
[51:11] he wondered why the young lamb had to
[51:16] die. While his blood was on the door,
[51:22] through the wind and the rain still
[51:26] remain, but he wanted to be sure.
[51:33] So called out to his earthly father
[51:38] with a trembling voice so scared
[51:43] crying father would you please look and
[51:47] see that the blood is still there.
[51:53] And he said, "Son, now don't you worry.
[51:58] For the blood is there to stay.
[52:04] The winds may blow, the rains may fall,
[52:09] but it won't just wash away.
[52:14] The blood will stand. The raging storm.
[52:19] It's been applied with love and care,
[52:25] safe, secure. You can rest assured that
[52:30] the blood is still there.
[52:38] Looking over all the damage
[52:43] Satan storm had left behind.
[52:48] A flood of endless questions
[52:53] and doubt had filled my mind.
[52:59] The fear that gripped my troubled soul
[53:04] brought me down on my knees and prayer.
[53:08] Crying, "Father, would you please look
[53:12] and see that the blood
[53:16] is still there?
[53:20] And he says, "Son, now don't you worry.
[53:26] For my blood, it's there to stay.
[53:32] The winds may blow, the rains may fall,
[53:37] but it won't just wash away.
[53:42] The blood will stand. The raging storm
[53:47] has been applied with my love and care.
[53:52] Oh, safe, secure. You can rest assured
[53:57] that my blood is still there,
[54:03] safe, secure. You can rest assured that
[54:08] the blood
[54:12] is still there.
[54:20] [Music]
[54:28] Sister Mary and Zoe. Amen. If you call
[54:31] me, man. Let's give them a hand.
[54:33] [Applause]
[55:13] [Music]
[55:28] Why do they leave?
[55:31] [Music]
[55:32] Isn't this still the same? Why do they
[55:37] seek
[55:40] for something more than simplicity?
[55:43] Why do they turn
[55:48] their backs on you? Oh Lord, why do they
[55:52] yearn
[55:55] for something more?
[55:57] [Music]
[55:59] Your truth is what I follow and it will
[56:03] still be true tomorrow.
[56:06] What I believe is not the works of any
[56:10] man.
[56:12] His
[56:15] kingdom can't be shaken
[56:18] on his glorious foundation.
[56:21] While others fall,
[56:24] here I stand.
[56:28] I know they said
[56:30] [Music]
[56:32] there is a great falling away. I know
[56:36] they try
[56:39] to complicate
[56:41] what you say, but in my soul,
[56:46] I'm sure of the rock I stand upon. One
[56:50] thing I know,
[56:54] I will press on.
[56:59] Your truth is what I follow and it will
[57:03] still be true tomorrow.
[57:06] What I believe is not the works of any
[57:10] man.
[57:14] His kingdom can't be shaken
[57:17] on this glorious foundation.
[57:21] While others fall,
[57:24] here I'll stand.
[57:27] [Music]
[57:28] On Christ the solid
[57:31] rock I stand on. Oh Lord, the ground is
[57:37] sinking sand.
[57:40] While others fall,
[57:44] here I stand.
[57:49] Your truth is what I follow and it will
[57:53] still be true tomorrow.
[57:56] What I believe is not the works of any
[58:00] man.
[58:02] [Music]
[58:04] This kingdom can't be shaken
[58:07] on this glorious foundation.
[58:11] While others fall,
[58:14] here I stand.
[58:18] While others fall,
[58:23] here I stand.
[58:31] [Applause]

[58:59] season just to worship the Lord a little
[59:02] bit. Amen. Before the word. Amen.

[59:43] children can go free. And little by
[59:48] little,
[59:49] you'll gain the victory.
[59:54] Oh, little by little,
[59:58] you can win every battle.
[1:00:03] Little by little, you can coner every f
[1:00:11] and I'll set boundaries
[1:00:14] around you. They will stretch from sea
[1:00:18] to sea. Little by little,
[1:00:23] I will prosper thee.
[1:00:26] Little by little, little by little, you
[1:00:31] can win every battle.

[1:00:41] f.
[1:00:44] And outset boundaries
[1:00:47] around you. They will stretch from sea
[1:00:50] to sea. Little by little,
[1:00:55] I will prosper thee.
[1:01:00] You've got rights
[1:01:03] in the Holy Spirit.

[1:01:08] You've been given
[1:01:10] full authority in his name.
[1:01:14] [Music]
[1:01:16] There's no time left now for crying.
[1:01:20] It's a shame to complain.
[1:01:24] You got to kick the devil off your
[1:01:26] mountain. You're predestined and
[1:01:30] ordained.
[1:01:32] Don't you know that you're a soldier in
[1:01:36] the army of the king?
[1:01:41] And little by little,
[1:01:45] you can win every battle.
[1:01:49] Little by little, you can coner every f
[1:01:57] and I'll set boundaries
[1:02:00] around you. They will stretch from sea
[1:02:04] to sea. Little by little,
[1:02:08] I will prosper thee. Say,
[1:02:13] little by little, you can win every
[1:02:18] battle.
[1:02:20] Oh, little by little, you can coner
[1:02:26] f
[1:02:29] and I'll set boundaries
[1:02:32] around you. Oh, they'll stretch from sea
[1:02:36] to sea. And little by little, I will
[1:02:41] prosper thee. Let's just raise our
[1:02:43] hands. Oh,
[1:02:45] little by little, you can win every
[1:02:50] battle.
[1:02:52] Say little by little you can coner every
[1:02:58] f
[1:03:01] and house and boundaries
[1:03:04] around you. They will stretch from sea

[1:03:12] I will prosper thee.

[1:03:22] battle.
[1:03:25] Little by little, you can coner every f.
[1:03:33] And I'll set boundaries
[1:03:35] around you. Glory.
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; They'll stretch from sea to sea. Little
[1:03:44] I will prosper thee. Give
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; the Lord a hand this morning.
[1:03:50] Hallelujah.
[1:03:53] Oh, give him some praise,
[1:03:59] little by little.
[1:04:01] You know, there's a there's a method to
[1:04:03] madness. They say, I want to tell you
[1:04:05] something. There's a method to
[1:04:07] overcoming. There's a method to being a
[1:04:10] believer and the Bible spells it out so
[1:04:12] clearly. I think we've had such a
[1:04:14] weekend of that, rooting that starting
[1:04:17] out with saying amen to every word. Just
[1:04:19] say a yes to the word. Listen, you might
[1:04:21] not be able to always I say, are you
[1:04:25] victorious? You might say,
[1:04:28] you know, are you are you overcoming?
[1:04:30] Well, but but how about this? The Lord
[1:04:32] has said you are you have already
[1:04:34] overcome. Just say yes. Just say yes.
[1:04:37] I'm just going to believe about me what
[1:04:40] the Lord says. Listen friends, little by
[1:04:42] little, you'll take it all. Amen. It's
[1:04:45] all about that daily coming before the
[1:04:48] Lord and saying, "Lord, today, today,
[1:04:51] how can I serve you today?" Do what?
[1:04:54] Jesus said, "Look, yesterday, there's
[1:04:56] yesterday, tomorrow to take care of
[1:04:58] itself. You can't go back and relive
[1:05:00] yesterday, but I can face today what's
[1:05:02] right in front of me." Amen. And that is
[1:05:05] a key. That's a a key. you'll just find
[1:05:07] yourself going up. I I told several
[1:05:10] people in the prayer line last night and
[1:05:12] and I've taken to saying it, you know, I
[1:05:14] said it to myself and that is, you know,
[1:05:17] we're climbing we're climbing Mount
[1:05:19] Zion. And every day just figure to reach
[1:05:22] up for a higher handhold. Pour yourself
[1:05:25] up to that one. The next day, reach up
[1:05:27] for another higher handhold. How many
[1:05:29] will do that? Now, you go from here and
[1:05:30] say, "I'm going to reach for a higher
[1:05:32] handhold tomorrow and then another
[1:05:34] higher one." I'm going to tell you
[1:05:35] something, friends. One of these days
[1:05:36] we're going to break through.
[1:05:38] Hallelujah. What a celebration. You're
[1:05:40] talking about a youth camp.
[1:05:45] My my
[1:05:49] that wedding banquet that's going to be
[1:05:51] the biggest youth camp gathering that's
[1:05:54] ever been conceived. Amen. It's going
[1:05:57] that table's going to have to stretch
[1:05:59] thousands of miles long. I'm going to be
[1:06:00] there. You going to be there.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Well, all too
[1:06:04] soon, just as we knew, uh, we started
[1:06:08] saying it, you know, even Thursday
[1:06:09] night, before you know it, it'll be
[1:06:11] Thursday, Friday, Saturday, here we are,
[1:06:13] Sunday. Amen. And I just think that what
[1:06:16] we should do is just start over and
[1:06:18] let's go all into the next week.
[1:06:21] I would have your parents calling me up
[1:06:23] saying, "Where is my child?" I say,
[1:06:25] "Well, we got in heavenly places and
[1:06:28] decided not to leave."
[1:06:30] Amen. Praise God. I sure appreciate I
[1:06:33] wanted to just say and take a moment and
[1:06:35] then we want to bring brother Donnie out
[1:06:37] and turn him loose again. He's the only
[1:06:38] man in the house dressed up. Amen. And
[1:06:41] so uh they said so this is a casual day.
[1:06:43] I said yeah it's a travel day. It's kind
[1:06:45] of a thing we do. I said brother Donnie
[1:06:47] be the only man dressed out. I said I
[1:06:49] ain't even sure if he will. Sometimes
[1:06:51] you know you never know. He might come
[1:06:53] in blue jeans as well. I said I don't
[1:06:55] care if he comes in bib overalls. Amen.
[1:06:57] As long as he's got the dress wear of
[1:06:59] the word of God around his life. That's
[1:07:00] what we're after, friends. Hallelujah.
[1:07:03] We want him to take his liberty again. I
[1:07:05] know we've we've had a lot of preaching
[1:07:07] and teaching and fellowship and food,
[1:07:10] natural and spiritual, but I just say
[1:07:13] once more, Lord. Once more, we got We're
[1:07:16] all going to travel home. We're all
[1:07:18] going to be Listen, the devil's going to
[1:07:19] be waiting on you next week to see if
[1:07:22] what you got here will really if you
[1:07:24] really meant it. And I just want to tell
[1:07:26] him right now, I mean it.
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; I mean it. I I I I tell you what, I
[1:07:31] don't I might not, you know, my W and L
[1:07:34] column don't always I I don't get always
[1:07:36] get wins. Sometimes I have some some in
[1:07:38] the L column, but I'm glad the Lord
[1:07:40] doesn't keep up with my wins and losses.
[1:07:43] Amen. He's interested in the fight. Are
[1:07:45] you willing to fight? Are you willing to
[1:07:47] press forward and keep going?
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Brother Wesley,
[1:07:51] you got out of my song. How'd you do
[1:07:53] that? You I didn't hear it last night,
[1:07:55] so Uhhuh. So you Okay. Yeah. going to
[1:07:58] give me the throat excuse. That's a I I
[1:08:00] had to live with around singers. I
[1:08:02] understand that. I know what's behind
[1:08:04] that. So, Amen. But next, that means you

[1:08:29] Amen. They've had uh you know they've
[1:08:32] had some graduations in their family and
[1:08:35] uh Amen. His brother Biscoll and his
[1:08:38] mother-in-law and my sister, she wrote
[1:08:40] to me from Washington. She said, "Are
[1:08:41] you sure Wesley's going to be able uh to
[1:08:44] be there this year?" I said, "If he's
[1:08:45] not, we're cancelling camp.
[1:08:49] There's a few people that are so
[1:08:50] integral that we just have to cancel it
[1:08:52] out if they're not coming. So, amen.
[1:08:54] Y'all, y'all keep Brother Wes in prayer.
[1:08:56] Amen. That he's here every year. Amen.
[1:08:58] Praise God. Well, we're going to go
[1:09:00] right to the word. And I just want to
[1:09:02] give a word of thanks and gratitude for
[1:09:04] all the people. It would be impossible
[1:09:07] for me to start naming names. Um, I like
[1:09:10] to just, you know, think of all the
[1:09:12] teams, all the counselors, all the
[1:09:14] workers, all the musicians, the worship
[1:09:17] team, all the preaching of the gospel,
[1:09:20] every everybody that is anybody that
[1:09:23] made that made it all go. And uh, I'm
[1:09:26] certainly I'd be right down at the very
[1:09:28] bottom of that list. I probably
[1:09:30] physically do the least, but uh, I I
[1:09:33] appreciate all my teams that gather
[1:09:35] around and make this happen. Amen. Amen.
[1:09:37] I appreciate, brother Matt, sister
[1:09:39] Rachel. They kind of headed up head up
[1:09:41] the whole thing from the top. Amen. All
[1:09:43] I get to mainly do is write the checks.
[1:09:45] Amen. And I'm glad. Don't bring your
[1:09:47] problem to me. Go figure it out. Amen.
[1:09:50] Praise the Lord. And uh we thank you for
[1:09:52] coming and uh and and trust that you had
[1:09:56] a wonderful time in the Lord. Have you
[1:09:58] enjoyed yourself here at Bethl Camp?
[1:10:00] Amen. 2025.
[1:10:03] God bless you. God bless you for that.
[1:10:08] Amen. Praise the Lord. We certainly want
[1:10:11] to carry on for as long as the Lord will
[1:10:13] allow it. But I I I every year I finish
[1:10:16] by by wishing and hoping that maybe this
[1:10:19] would be the last one on this side and
[1:10:21] we'd all be in glory this time next
[1:10:23] year. Won't that be a time Listen
[1:10:25] friends, that's for real. Your future is
[1:10:27] bright. It's not uncertain. It's
[1:10:29] definite. Amen. Praise the Lord. And we
[1:10:32] have uh we have an appointment. I I tell
[1:10:34] you, if you ever want a conversation
[1:10:36] starter, be in a crowd of people and get
[1:10:37] them talking about, well, you know, the
[1:10:39] the end of the world, and just pipe up
[1:10:41] and say, "No, the world's not ending."
[1:10:43] No, the world is just transitioning. The
[1:10:46] world, the earth's an eternal attribute
[1:10:48] of God. It can never be annihilated.
[1:10:49] We're just headed into a new kingdom
[1:10:51] with a new king, and he's going to
[1:10:52] change the whole system. Amen. Praise
[1:10:55] the Lord. I'm here to tell you, friends,
[1:10:57] I will still be alive in in in 2125.
[1:11:03] I will I will still be alive. I will not
[1:11:05] have perished from the earth. I I may
[1:11:07] this body may go into a grave that that
[1:11:09] just a temple I live in. I will still be
[1:11:12] here in 2425.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; I will be alive in the 25th century, the
[1:11:17] 27th century, the 28th century. Do you
[1:11:20] understand that's a reality? Your future
[1:11:22] is just ahead of you. And that's the
[1:11:24] reality of it.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the name of the Lord. Well,
[1:11:28] it's not it's not my job to do the
[1:11:30] preaching today. I'm thankful I get to
[1:11:32] shout over here, sit over here and shout
[1:11:33] a few more times. Amen. Sometimes I I
[1:11:36] may get a little excited. I can't help
[1:11:38] that. And neither do I apologize for it.
[1:11:40] I just love the word. It gets so
[1:11:42] delicious. I feel like my dad, he said,
[1:11:44] I feel like blowing through the roof and
[1:11:45] landing out in the road somewhere. Amen.
[1:11:48] So, Amen. If I if I seem to get
[1:11:51] exuberant, it's because I love the word
[1:11:53] of God. Amen. And I strive every day,
[1:11:56] every day, Lord, let me be more like
[1:11:58] that word. Amen. That should be all of
[1:12:01] our desire, friends. Let the let the
[1:12:03] book live in me. That should be the
[1:12:06] loudest voice right now at this stage,
[1:12:09] this many decades in. The loudest voice
[1:12:12] in the message should be the voice of
[1:12:14] lived lives.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. I've asked brother
[1:12:19] Tony to sing that song by his
[1:12:21] mother-in-law, Sister Brenda Lewis, and
[1:12:23] I want him to sing it again as we invite
[1:12:25] Brother Donnie. Amen. Little by little,
[1:12:27] you you remember that when you when
[1:12:29] tomorrow and the next day, you just keep
[1:12:32] saying, "Little by little, little by
[1:12:34] little, I'm going to take it all."
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. As we invite
[1:12:38] Brother Donnie to come, let's sing it
[1:12:39] again.

[1:12:47] battle.

[1:12:54] right. every fold.

[1:13:01] promised
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; around you.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; They'll stretch.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; They will stretch from sea to sea.
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; Little by little, little by little.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; I will prosper thee

[1:13:21] every battle.

[1:13:29] every hole
[1:13:33] and I'll set the boundaries
[1:13:36] around you. They will stretch from sea
[1:13:40] to seed and little by little
[1:13:45] I will prosper thee.

[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus. Oh, and I'll set
[1:14:09] boundaries
[1:14:10] around you.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; Stretch from sea to sea. And little by
[1:14:18] little,
[1:14:19] I will prosper thee.
[1:14:24] Praise the Lord.
[1:14:30] Thank you, Lord.
[1:14:34] God bless you, sir. Certainly appreciate
[1:14:36] the opportunity to be able to be with
[1:14:37] you again today. And we're grateful for
[1:14:41] all the effort that's been put forth in
[1:14:43] these meetings, all the things that go
[1:14:45] on behind the scene. All the folks that
[1:14:47] do that have to sacrifice, can't even
[1:14:50] hear the word, can't be able to be in
[1:14:52] service. I appreciate that. Don't you?
[1:14:56] It's great sacrifice for all of them.
[1:14:58] May the Lord bless them. And we want to
[1:15:00] just uh pray together. Want to if you
[1:15:03] just bow your heads.
[1:15:06] Lord Jesus, as we've assembled here
[1:15:07] today, Father, for the last service of
[1:15:11] these series that we've been privileged
[1:15:14] to be a part of, we want you to know
[1:15:17] that we're thankful some Lord already
[1:15:20] heading home. Brother Stephen Coffee,
[1:15:22] Brother Diggs heading toward home and
[1:15:24] Lord, you see our brother Charles
[1:15:26] Anderson and the church there, his wife.
[1:15:29] And Lord, we know each one of us were
[1:15:32] coming that way if the rapture doesn't
[1:15:34] catch us first. But we know how
[1:15:37] difficult it can be whenever they are
[1:15:40] called away. And you actually you let us
[1:15:44] borrow them for a while. As I was
[1:15:46] looking at it earlier this morning where
[1:15:48] your prophet was talking about his own
[1:15:50] little girl and he said that you loaned
[1:15:53] her to him and then you called her home.
[1:15:58] So we realize that our loved ones, our
[1:16:00] friends, our families are on they're on
[1:16:02] loan and one day you'll call the loan
[1:16:05] in. So we want to do everything we can
[1:16:08] while we're here in this life to be able
[1:16:10] to influence one another in the right
[1:16:12] way. We pray, Father, that you would
[1:16:15] help us as we come to the closing part
[1:16:18] of of the service today. Lord, help me.
[1:16:20] I can say something that would be a
[1:16:23] blessing to them. They've already heard
[1:16:24] so many good things from these other
[1:16:26] brothers. We're grateful for each one.
[1:16:28] Lord, we pray that you'd watch over all
[1:16:30] those that'll be traveling today. May
[1:16:32] the spirit of God just keep your hand
[1:16:34] upon them. How we long for that time
[1:16:37] when we'll gather together. Your prophet
[1:16:39] said, "Think of it, missing people. They
[1:16:42] come up together, missing on the earth,
[1:16:46] and we can't find them no more. And
[1:16:48] they're getting together with the rest
[1:16:51] of the group. That's the hour we're
[1:16:54] waiting for, Lord Jesus.
[1:16:56] But until that hour comes, we're going
[1:16:58] to keep on having youth camps and having
[1:17:00] meetings and church and doing carrying
[1:17:02] right home with the father's business.
[1:17:04] Help us today, Lord. We pray in the name
[1:17:07] of Jesus. Amen.
[1:17:10] I want to thank brother Jason for
[1:17:12] letting us come and be a part of it uh
[1:17:15] of the services. Always enjoy preaching
[1:17:18] with brother Jason. We've had some times
[1:17:20] together overseas and been a dear friend
[1:17:23] and certainly love and appreciate him.
[1:17:25] Let's read together if you would today.
[1:17:27] Mark chapter 5.
[1:17:33] I know we got a kind of a time thing to
[1:17:36] to be out of here. So, you don't have to
[1:17:38] worry about me. I've got under a 4 hour
[1:17:40] sermon, so we're good.
[1:17:43] Couple
[1:17:45] years ago, I was up with Brother Tim
[1:17:47] Prud at Brother Ron Spencer's church,
[1:17:49] and I had to preach two services, and
[1:17:53] brother Tim had to preach one. So, I
[1:17:56] asked Brother Ron, I said, "Why why am I
[1:18:00] having to preach two services, and
[1:18:02] brother Tim just gets one?" He said,
[1:18:04] "Well, I wanted y'all to have equal
[1:18:06] time.
[1:18:14] God help me. He'll hear this. Sure is
[1:18:15] the world.
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:20] I want to speak to you just a very
[1:18:22] simple thought today. He proves his
[1:18:26] word.
[1:18:28] Mark 5 22.
[1:18:31] And behold, there cometh one of the
[1:18:33] rulers of the synagogue, Jaras by name.
[1:18:37] And when he saw him, he fell at his feet
[1:18:39] and besought him greatly, saying, My
[1:18:41] little daughter lies at the point of
[1:18:43] death. I praise thee, come and lay thy
[1:18:47] hands on her that she may be healed, and
[1:18:51] she shall live." And Jesus went with
[1:18:54] him, and much people followed and
[1:18:58] thronged him. You may be seated. Let's
[1:19:00] just continue reading there in verse 38,
[1:19:02] if you would. And he cometh to the house
[1:19:06] of the ruler of the synagogue, and sith
[1:19:08] a tomalt, and them that wept, and wailed
[1:19:10] greatly. And when he was come in, he
[1:19:12] saith unto them, Why make ye this a do
[1:19:18] and weep. The damsel is not dead, but
[1:19:22] sleepeth. And they laughed him to scorn.
[1:19:27] But when he had put them all out, he
[1:19:29] taketh the father and the mother of the
[1:19:31] damsel, and them that were with him, and
[1:19:33] enters into where the damsel was lying.
[1:19:36] And he took the damsel by the hand, and
[1:19:39] saith unto her, Tisa Kumi, which is
[1:19:43] being interpreted, damsel, I say unto
[1:19:46] thee, arise. And straightway the damsel
[1:19:50] arose and walked, for she was of the age
[1:19:53] of 12 years. and they were astonished
[1:19:56] with a great astonishment.
[1:19:59] Now, we've heard some awesome things
[1:20:02] these days that we've been able to be
[1:20:04] together. And of course, it's not the
[1:20:05] first time that you you use have heard
[1:20:07] awesome things. You come from churches
[1:20:09] that believe the word and preach the
[1:20:11] word. Your pastors, evangelists, and men
[1:20:14] of God that he's called around the world
[1:20:16] to be able to bring the words of life.
[1:20:19] But when we come like this, it's a
[1:20:20] special meetings, a special times for
[1:20:23] sure. And every minister I'm sure
[1:20:25] they've studied and prayed and asked God
[1:20:28] to give them something that would be a
[1:20:30] benefit to you. So whenever you go back
[1:20:32] home, you back to college, back to
[1:20:34] school, whatever your normaly is
[1:20:37] whenever you leave here that you will
[1:20:39] have got something out of these meetings
[1:20:41] that will help you, something that will
[1:20:44] benefit you, make you a better
[1:20:45] Christian. I hear the prophet say there
[1:20:48] when he was there in 1963 that he wanted
[1:20:50] to bring something to the tabernacle,
[1:20:52] something that would make them better
[1:20:53] people. And he said actually in 1965 he
[1:20:56] said it this way that he wanted to give
[1:20:58] them something that would help them to
[1:21:00] keep the punches off of them as much as
[1:21:04] possible to keep the punches off of them
[1:21:06] because there's no way that you're ever
[1:21:08] going to be in this life free from war,
[1:21:10] free from trouble, free from heartache.
[1:21:12] But the thing of it is how are we going
[1:21:14] to deal with it? How are we going to be
[1:21:16] able to when it comes against us, what
[1:21:18] are we going to do? What's our reaction
[1:21:20] going to be? So, I'd like to uh speak to
[1:21:23] you today on that God proves his word.
[1:21:25] And I want to read you this quote from
[1:21:27] proving his word that he proves his word
[1:21:29] in every age by the most unusual way.
[1:21:33] But he always does it in the same way.
[1:21:36] You see, what did he do in the days of
[1:21:37] Noah? He was fixing to deliver the
[1:21:40] remnant. He sent Noah. Sent them Noah
[1:21:43] the prophet. and he sent Noah a sign.
[1:21:46] Now, as our brother just sang to us, the
[1:21:48] song even of the possession that our
[1:21:51] precious sister which has gone on to her
[1:21:53] reward was one of the many songs that
[1:21:55] the Lord gave her. Little by little,
[1:21:57] it's been sung all over the world. And
[1:21:59] it it has such a special meaning to us
[1:22:01] because we realize that this is the way
[1:22:03] that we take our land. This is the way
[1:22:06] that we take our inheritance, our
[1:22:08] possession. There's days that we will
[1:22:10] have great gains, but most of those days
[1:22:13] are going to be smaller gains. And as
[1:22:15] bad as we hate to say it, there will be
[1:22:17] days that we may actually retract some.
[1:22:20] There may be days to when we think,
[1:22:22] Lord, where are you? And you've you've
[1:22:25] heard wonderful things these days that
[1:22:27] are here that you are here and gather
[1:22:29] together and fellowship with one
[1:22:31] another. And in one way, we wish it
[1:22:33] could go on and on and on and never end.
[1:22:36] But you're longing for heaven when
[1:22:37] you're thinking about that. But we know
[1:22:39] that what we do is we get here and as
[1:22:42] that sign says right there, we're
[1:22:44] getting tools and equipment.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; Tools and equipment so we can be able to
[1:22:50] face the battle that's ahead of us. And
[1:22:52] we know some of the greatest trials in
[1:22:55] our life come under come after the most
[1:22:57] tremendous blessings that God has ever
[1:22:59] given. So after God comes on the scene
[1:23:02] and manifest himself as Jehovah Gyra to
[1:23:05] Abraham and him and Isaac come off the
[1:23:07] mountain, the very next verse in the
[1:23:10] very next chapter is what? Anybody know
[1:23:13] by memory? It is the deaths of Sarah. So
[1:23:16] after one of the greatest blessings in
[1:23:19] his life come one of the most difficult
[1:23:22] trials in his life as well. And we know
[1:23:25] that that's the way Satan does. So we
[1:23:27] gather together, we get many great
[1:23:29] things and tools and equipment as it
[1:23:31] were. And then Satan will try to come
[1:23:33] against us and then try to take away
[1:23:36] from us what we've actually accumulated
[1:23:39] while we've been together these days.
[1:23:40] And we know his tactics. We're not
[1:23:42] ignorant. And you know, I don't think we
[1:23:44] should leave these this place and other
[1:23:46] places like this and say, "Oh no. Oh no.
[1:23:48] I I I got so many things that I dread
[1:23:51] going home." There's no need for us to
[1:23:52] do that. we just face it and say, "By
[1:23:55] the grace of God, he's equipped us. He's
[1:23:57] going to give me what I have need of,
[1:23:59] and he's going to help me to be able to
[1:24:01] fight this battle that I'm engaged in."
[1:24:04] And we know that we are. And yet, when
[1:24:06] you look at it, Brother Rim talks about
[1:24:08] Joshua and Caleb. And what does he
[1:24:10] always do? He cannot use unbelievers to
[1:24:14] prove his word. Now, there are certain
[1:24:17] scriptures that I personally have no
[1:24:19] desire to fulfill. There's certain parts
[1:24:22] of the word I don't want to fulfill. No,
[1:24:25] there's somebody going to hell. I don't
[1:24:27] want to fulfill that part. There's
[1:24:29] people going to be lost. I don't want to
[1:24:30] fulfill that part. I hope I'm alive and
[1:24:33] remaining that I can be able to fulfill
[1:24:35] part of the rapture. But whether I'm
[1:24:37] alive or go by the way of the grave,
[1:24:39] I'll feel one fulfill one or the other.
[1:24:41] But there's portions of the word that
[1:24:43] you and I are called by God to fulfill.
[1:24:46] And part of that is victory. Part of
[1:24:49] that is testimony things that God's
[1:24:52] going to do in our life and exalt his
[1:24:54] power through us. And we know that it'll
[1:24:56] not just be old people, but there was
[1:24:58] many younger people that gave their
[1:25:01] lives in the time of the first century.
[1:25:04] There were many young mothers, as they
[1:25:06] put it on the skit yesterday. There were
[1:25:08] many young men. I'm thinking of one
[1:25:10] sister and her name was Srosa. And she
[1:25:13] had seven sons. All seven of those sons,
[1:25:17] they their lives were took. Some of them
[1:25:19] were pulled behind horses. Some of them
[1:25:22] they tied them between animals, excuse
[1:25:25] me, and they pulled their their arms and
[1:25:27] their legs off of their body. Can you
[1:25:29] imagine what how Sister Simosa felt when
[1:25:32] she went back to church the next time?
[1:25:34] And this all happened within about a
[1:25:36] week or 10 days and they killed all
[1:25:38] seven of her sons. Can you imagine what
[1:25:41] kind of testimony that she would have
[1:25:43] had when she went back to church the
[1:25:45] next time and they had a testimony
[1:25:47] service? Anybody want to testify?
[1:25:50] Anybody want to say anything about the
[1:25:52] glory of God? And Sister Sosa stood her
[1:25:55] feet and said, "I want to thank God for
[1:25:57] his mercy. I want to thank God for his
[1:26:00] grace." Now, we thank Lord. It's not
[1:26:02] just those victorious days when miracles
[1:26:05] are happening right and left, but it's
[1:26:08] those times when the troubles are are so
[1:26:11] mounting up on our lives and whenever
[1:26:13] you get wonderful things. And no doubt
[1:26:15] as sheep, you will ruminate over things
[1:26:18] that was said. And each man, each
[1:26:20] brother here that's been here is gifted
[1:26:22] by God in a very unique way. And they in
[1:26:25] their own unique way will say things
[1:26:27] that will be able to go to you and you
[1:26:29] and you. And God does that. God could
[1:26:31] have made every preacher exactly the
[1:26:33] same. But why would you need 5,000 of
[1:26:34] them? Only need one. Everybody follow
[1:26:36] him. So God makes us so diverse. And yet
[1:26:40] each man has the ability and his gift is
[1:26:43] so designed by God to be able to touch
[1:26:45] you and you and you and you. And yet
[1:26:47] there's others. And you say, "I I really
[1:26:50] love that brother. I really think a lot
[1:26:52] of him, but I just don't get that much
[1:26:54] from him." But thank God there's others
[1:26:56] that say, "Oh, you don't? Are you
[1:26:58] kidding me? My I love to hear that guy
[1:27:00] preach. Well, God does that on purpose.
[1:27:03] You know, Brother Dan Daisy told me
[1:27:05] years and years ago, he said, "Brother
[1:27:07] Donnie, you know, preachers are like
[1:27:08] lifesavers. They come in all different
[1:27:10] flavors." Well, I found that to be true.
[1:27:13] And yet, God is the one who diversifies
[1:27:15] it and makes it that way. So, you will
[1:27:18] begin to ruminate. Maybe you've already
[1:27:20] thought about things that statements of
[1:27:22] victory, statements of challenge,
[1:27:24] statements of of of encouragement that
[1:27:27] you've already logged in your memory and
[1:27:30] things that you will go back upon. And
[1:27:32] no doubt as you live after these few
[1:27:34] days of gathering together, these are
[1:27:36] monumental times to me. They're great
[1:27:39] times that we assemble as the saints of
[1:27:41] God. And there will be things that Satan
[1:27:43] will try you on. And remember, when you
[1:27:45] get something that is absolutely a
[1:27:48] permanent deposit of the revelation of
[1:27:50] God in your soul, that is added to the
[1:27:53] accumulative part of God that he shared
[1:27:55] with you. Remember what God is sharing
[1:27:57] with each of us is actually his deity.
[1:28:00] In 1949, brother Brown tells us that
[1:28:03] deity is no longer in a manger. Deity is
[1:28:07] not in heaven, but deity is inside of
[1:28:10] every one of you.
[1:28:12] And each revelation that you get is
[1:28:15] actually more of that deity of God that
[1:28:18] he's giving to the accumulative
[1:28:19] revelation of your entire life. What's
[1:28:22] it for? To help you be a better sister,
[1:28:25] help you be a better brother. Is that
[1:28:26] right? And then whenever Satan hears us
[1:28:30] respond in the services and he sees us
[1:28:32] respond and his demons are taking note
[1:28:35] of that and they're watching you and
[1:28:37] they can tell when something so strikes
[1:28:39] your soul and then you know what they
[1:28:41] will do? They will do their best to try
[1:28:44] to take the value of that away from you
[1:28:47] when you leave these meetings. So we
[1:28:49] don't leave victori not victorious
[1:28:51] rather and we don't leave down. We don't
[1:28:54] leave thinking well I'm going to pay for
[1:28:56] all this. Well, that may be true in one
[1:28:58] way, but God's going to give you the
[1:29:00] strength to be able to do it. So, God
[1:29:02] has anointed his men's servants while
[1:29:05] we've been together here. And they've
[1:29:07] said certain things that has been able
[1:29:09] to be a channel by which the spirit of
[1:29:11] God would flow to you and make a divine
[1:29:14] connection. It's hard to explain that
[1:29:15] unless you're a preacher. But there's
[1:29:17] certain people that in the congregation
[1:29:19] that if you'll find them while you're
[1:29:21] preaching and you'll see their eyes and
[1:29:23] you'll watch their attitude. It don't
[1:29:25] take everybody in the church. All it
[1:29:26] takes is a few. And the preacher can
[1:29:28] preach to the few of them cuz some of
[1:29:30] the rest of them they'll sit there and
[1:29:31] watch their watch. You know, they've got
[1:29:33] their mind who knows where it's at. And
[1:29:35] you kind of actually preach over the top
[1:29:37] of them. You don't even look at them. Is
[1:29:38] that right, brothers? You just preach
[1:29:40] over the top of them because they'll
[1:29:41] pull you down if you'll let them. as a
[1:29:44] preacher, they will. Others will sit
[1:29:46] there, they're not paying no attention
[1:29:47] to what you have to say. They're just
[1:29:49] kind of looking around and watching
[1:29:50] their watch and they're wanting to know
[1:29:52] how many pages I've got on my iPad. I
[1:29:54] ain't going to tell you.
[1:29:56] And they're wondering how's this going
[1:29:58] to go and that's going to go. But if you
[1:29:59] can find a few that you can preach to,
[1:30:02] you lock into them and they will pull
[1:30:05] out of you and the spirit of God makes
[1:30:07] that channel in between you. So that
[1:30:09] happens in every service and we know
[1:30:11] it's that way. And then God will give
[1:30:13] you a word. I hope and pray that many of
[1:30:15] you have got more than one word while
[1:30:17] you've been here. And then God will give
[1:30:20] you that word. And this is the
[1:30:21] phenomenal part about it. God will
[1:30:23] actually allow Satan to come back and
[1:30:26] try you after he revealed that word to
[1:30:30] you. And God is making a testimony about
[1:30:33] you that we never hear. Remember Job was
[1:30:37] not privy to the testimony meeting that
[1:30:39] went on in heaven. Now, most testimony
[1:30:41] meetings, it's people stand up and say,
[1:30:43] "Well, glory to God. I want to thank the
[1:30:45] Lord for what he done, and he done this
[1:30:47] for me and that for me." But you see,
[1:30:49] when heaven has testimony services, it's
[1:30:52] God testifying about his children. And
[1:30:55] he said, "I want you to know, devil,
[1:30:57] I've got young people down there. I've
[1:30:58] got young ladies. I've got young men.
[1:31:01] I've got preachers. I've got deacons.
[1:31:03] I've got sons and daughters. And they're
[1:31:05] going to stand faithful." And the devil
[1:31:08] then what the devil does is challenges
[1:31:10] God's testimony about you. And then God
[1:31:13] goes back and said, "No, I know my boy.
[1:31:15] I know my boy. Ben him's been
[1:31:17] fellowshipping. We've been having a
[1:31:18] time." And then what will God allow
[1:31:21] Satan to do? He will allow him to try
[1:31:24] you to see if you will stand on that
[1:31:27] word that God gave to you. Now, we know
[1:31:30] that there's two Greek words that are
[1:31:32] used to to describe our English word,
[1:31:34] and that is the word word. WRD in the
[1:31:37] New Testament. One of them is logos,
[1:31:39] which most of us are familiar with. But
[1:31:41] there's another one called Rama, Rh- A.
[1:31:45] Now, it's it's a same English word. Our
[1:31:47] interpreters didn't do it quite right.
[1:31:48] The translators, but anyway, whenever we
[1:31:51] look at that, the logos is the concept
[1:31:53] or the mandate of God for the hour. But
[1:31:56] a Rama word is a word that God takes
[1:31:59] right out of his scripture and God
[1:32:02] quickens it to you for your particular
[1:32:05] need of what you're going through. Now
[1:32:07] Jesus said man shall not live by every
[1:32:10] word that proceedth out of the mouth of
[1:32:12] or bread but by every word. And that
[1:32:14] word there is not logos but it's
[1:32:17] actually rama word. And whenever it
[1:32:20] comes to faith cometh by hearing and
[1:32:22] hearing by the word that's not hearing
[1:32:24] logos, it's actually rama word. So it's
[1:32:27] a word that God quickens to you. Do you
[1:32:30] understand what's happened here these
[1:32:31] days that we've had together? You've got
[1:32:33] one Rama word after another after
[1:32:36] another. Now, it was already logos and
[1:32:38] maybe you've quoted it for years and
[1:32:41] years in your Bible. And then God caught
[1:32:44] you up in a moment of inspiration and
[1:32:47] the spirit of God had a preacher to use
[1:32:49] that same scripture, that same quote
[1:32:51] that you love with all of your heart.
[1:32:53] But all of the sudden, the inspiration
[1:32:56] caught that logos and transformed it
[1:32:59] into a rama word and it become your word
[1:33:02] for your battle right now. Don't you
[1:33:05] love it when God does it that way? Have
[1:33:07] you ever applied the word, whether you
[1:33:09] need healing or deliverance or whatever
[1:33:10] it is, and you say the same word over
[1:33:12] and over again. What are you doing?
[1:33:14] You're repeating logos. And then one day
[1:33:16] you get up and you quote that same
[1:33:18] scripture that you've quoted over and
[1:33:20] over again. And you quote it, but then
[1:33:23] you start seeing the manifestation of
[1:33:25] that word. Logos was being said over and
[1:33:28] over and over again. And it's
[1:33:30] accumulating. It's accumulating as it's
[1:33:32] building faith in your heart and then
[1:33:34] God will anoint that logos word and
[1:33:37] totally transforms that and it becomes a
[1:33:40] rama word and then it's your personal
[1:33:43] word. Now we realize all through the old
[1:33:46] testament that God did that for his
[1:33:48] children and of course in the new he's
[1:33:50] done exactly the same thing. I love the
[1:33:52] way brother Brandham says this and the
[1:33:53] proving of his word. This is quite a
[1:33:55] long quote so I won't read all of it
[1:33:57] just for the saving of time. I go down
[1:33:59] to paragraph 119. No matter how close
[1:34:01] you are to Jordan, no matter what your
[1:34:04] circumstances in, if you could only hold
[1:34:06] that promise of God in your heart, God
[1:34:09] will prove that it's so. In the midst of
[1:34:12] all unbelief, he'll still prove that
[1:34:15] it's so. How many believes that? And
[1:34:17] circumstances doesn't stop him. He will
[1:34:20] do the same as he has done. If his
[1:34:23] children will only take his word, notice
[1:34:27] he can prove it by you.
[1:34:30] Now you young people, do you understand
[1:34:32] that there are words that God will prove
[1:34:34] by you that he never will use to prove
[1:34:38] by brother Jason or maybe brother Paul
[1:34:40] or some of these other ministers that
[1:34:42] you look at and you have such great
[1:34:44] honor and respect for it and you should.
[1:34:46] But yet there's an allocation of the
[1:34:49] word that God has given that some of you
[1:34:52] will fulfill. I will never fulfill. Some
[1:34:54] of the people that you meet and that you
[1:34:56] rub shoulders with, you think that I'm
[1:34:59] it's up to me to go try to win them to
[1:35:01] the Lord. Up to brother Jason to go win
[1:35:03] them to the Lord. But God will have a
[1:35:06] divine allocation of his word given to
[1:35:09] your life. And guess what? Nobody can
[1:35:11] fulfill that word but you. You need to
[1:35:14] get this out of your mind that you are
[1:35:17] wasteless. That there's nothing about
[1:35:19] you that's any good. Your life is
[1:35:21] wasted. I've never accomplished
[1:35:23] anything. That is the thinking of the
[1:35:25] devil. And you need to realize you've
[1:35:27] been brought on the purpose to serve on
[1:35:30] this earth. Almighty God has a plan for
[1:35:33] every one of you. I don't care your age.
[1:35:36] I don't care your race or color. That is
[1:35:38] nothing to do with it. The Lord God
[1:35:40] loves you and he called you to be a
[1:35:43] representative of his truth in the last
[1:35:45] day. And God will use you to prove that
[1:35:49] word is absolutely the truth.
[1:35:52] Oh my. He doesn't prove it by the
[1:35:55] unbelievers. He said it cannot be proved
[1:35:57] by them because they are unbelievers.
[1:36:00] It's to him that will believe. If he can
[1:36:02] find somebody, oh Lord, I hope he can
[1:36:05] find somebody here this morning. If he
[1:36:07] can find somebody who will believe his
[1:36:10] word, he will prove his word by you.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; Now, you realize there's time slots by
[1:36:18] which God allocates his word. And we
[1:36:21] know that the rapture was in the mind of
[1:36:23] God before the foundation of the world.
[1:36:25] And even though Paul wrote about it, God
[1:36:27] would not use Paul's life to prove those
[1:36:31] which are alive and remain. Brother
[1:36:33] Random wanted to be one of those that
[1:36:35] was alive and remain. But God never took
[1:36:38] him to prove that word. I believe with
[1:36:40] all of my heart, I'm I'm standing right
[1:36:42] here today looking at some people that
[1:36:45] will not die. that God will use you to
[1:36:49] prove that word. Hallelujah. Those of us
[1:36:52] who are alive and remain. You understand
[1:36:54] what I'm saying? So God has certain
[1:36:57] words. He had a word for Noah. He had a
[1:36:59] word for Moses. We've heard it over and
[1:37:01] over again. He had a word for Luther. He
[1:37:03] had a word for Wesley, Pentecost, and so
[1:37:05] on. But God has words for us. And God
[1:37:09] has words for brother Brandham. And we
[1:37:11] know for years and years as message
[1:37:13] people that we focus mainly on the
[1:37:15] prophet. But we understand no matter how
[1:37:18] much we ever see our position, it will
[1:37:20] never take away from the prophet of
[1:37:22] God's place. Is that right? But the
[1:37:25] message of the hour is not just about
[1:37:27] brother Brandham. As a matter of fact,
[1:37:30] if you read Malachi 4 real close, you'll
[1:37:32] find out there's some more that is
[1:37:34] focusing on right there. Behold, I
[1:37:37] almighty God will send unto you Elijah
[1:37:41] the prophet. Do you understand? You also
[1:37:45] are in Malachi 4. It's not just Brother
[1:37:48] Brandham, but you also are in Malachi 4.
[1:37:52] Behold, I send unto you Elijah the
[1:37:56] prophet. That is your word.
[1:38:00] Hallelujah. That word has your name on
[1:38:03] it. And Satan is not going to stop it.
[1:38:06] Do you believe he could stop brother
[1:38:08] Brandham? No way. Then if he could not
[1:38:11] stop brother Brandham from fulfilling
[1:38:13] that word, you and I need to rise to the
[1:38:16] challenge of the hour and say he will
[1:38:19] not stop us. Though he tries me, though
[1:38:23] all kinds of things come my way, I will
[1:38:26] fulfill the word of God allocated for my
[1:38:29] life.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah.
[1:38:34] He says if he can find somebody who will
[1:38:37] believe his word, he'll prove his word
[1:38:40] by you. And sometimes sickness and
[1:38:43] things happen to us that way that God
[1:38:46] can prove himself.
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; I don't know. I'm telling you, I don't
[1:38:51] really enjoy them types of things.
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; I enjoy health better than sickness.
[1:38:56] Anybody with me?
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; Which would you rather have? A full
[1:39:00] wallet or a flat one? Would you rather
[1:39:04] have all your bills paid or all of them
[1:39:07] still laying on the counter you're going
[1:39:08] to be looking at when you go back home?
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; Well, come on. That's our choice. Would
[1:39:13] you rather have great services and move
[1:39:15] all the time and all that or they're
[1:39:17] going to have services when it's going
[1:39:18] to be kind of dry from the start? And as
[1:39:20] a pastor, you sit back in the study and
[1:39:22] you say, "Oh no, it's going to be one of
[1:39:25] them kind." And it starts out draggy.
[1:39:27] The songs is draggy. The prayer requests
[1:39:30] are draggy. and the preacher get up and
[1:39:32] he's dragging and everybody drags home
[1:39:34] and drags out.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; And yet you say, "Oh Lord, well, after
[1:39:40] we left the camp meeting, my goodness, I
[1:39:43] can't believe the pastor's no more
[1:39:45] fiery." Well, if you'd pull on your
[1:39:47] pastor at home the way you pull on us at
[1:39:49] camp meeting, it might help your
[1:39:51] services be better. The preacher don't
[1:39:54] bring these revivals in his briefcase.
[1:39:56] The preacher does not the one that
[1:39:58] motivates it. But it's your expectation.
[1:40:02] If each one of you would go back to your
[1:40:04] home church and you get there Wednesday
[1:40:06] night and you go to say, "Glory, praise
[1:40:09] the Lord. Amen." You may have to pick
[1:40:12] the pastor up off the floor and
[1:40:14] resuscitate him, but in a few minutes
[1:40:16] he'll say, "Thank you, Jesus. Thank you,
[1:40:18] Jesus." But what is it? It's your
[1:40:21] portion. It's not the preacher that
[1:40:23] makes the service alone. Each one of you
[1:40:26] have an input.
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; And the service right here today won't
[1:40:31] be determined by how much I studied. It
[1:40:33] will not be determined by how much I
[1:40:36] prayed. It will be determined by my part
[1:40:39] plus your part plus his part. And if we
[1:40:42] mix it all together, there ain't no
[1:40:45] telling what God will do.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Now you see the Lord Jesus the
[1:40:52] prophet uses this about the little girl
[1:40:54] and we're all familiar with her whenever
[1:40:56] she died and Jesus made the proclamation
[1:40:58] that the girl is not dead. So now God
[1:41:01] has to prove his word but it was her
[1:41:04] deaths that brought that word in.
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; I don't like them types of experiences.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; Somebody's going to be persecuted. Well,
[1:41:16] I've been one of them.
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; Y'all been one of them. Haven't you?
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; Do you really? Is that one of your
[1:41:22] favorite things in scripture?
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; How many wants to be hated?
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; Cast out, talked about, run down.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; But somebody's got to do it.
[1:41:35] &gt;&gt; So what would most of us do? We'd go
[1:41:36] down there and select. Okay, I love this
[1:41:38] scripture. I love this one. Oh, I love
[1:41:40] Psalms 37:4. Delight yourself also on
[1:41:43] the Lord, and he'll give you the desires
[1:41:44] of thine heart. I love St. John 15:7.
[1:41:46] And if you abide in me and my words
[1:41:48] abide in you, ask what you will and it
[1:41:49] shall be done. I love the one in Matthew
[1:41:51] where Jesus said, "Hither too you've
[1:41:52] asked nothing in my name, but ask and
[1:41:54] you your joys will be full." Don't you
[1:41:55] love all them? Oh, they're so wonderful.
[1:41:57] Don't you love where Paul said,
[1:41:58] "Beloved, I wish above all things that
[1:41:59] thou mayest prosper and be in hell, even
[1:42:01] as thy soul prospers." Don't you love
[1:42:03] those things? Oh, happy is the people
[1:42:04] whose God is the Lord. Shout to the
[1:42:06] voice of the Lord with a voice of
[1:42:08] triumph. Oh, just wonderful scriptures.
[1:42:09] And then God comes over with these sad
[1:42:12] ones,
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; Valley scriptures.
[1:42:16] trial scriptures.
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; And what would all of us do? Skip them.
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; So, we're checking the box.
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; Oh, I love that one in Psalms. How good
[1:42:30] and how pleasant together it is for
[1:42:31] brethren to dwell together in unity. I
[1:42:33] love that one in Deuteronomy. Here, O
[1:42:35] Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord. I
[1:42:37] love the one in Isaiah 35:3. Behold,
[1:42:39] your God shall come. The lame man shall
[1:42:41] leap as heart. The tongue of the dung.
[1:42:42] The tongue of the dung shall sing and
[1:42:44] they're going to rejoice and oh yes yes
[1:42:45] yes. I'll be with you. I'll never leave
[1:42:48] you. Yes. Yes. Check. Check check.
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; But but but
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; you will be hated
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; of all men for my name's sake.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; And I skip over that one.
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; You're going to be talked about. You're
[1:43:03] going to be run down. You're going to be
[1:43:04] despised and rejected.
[1:43:07] Right.
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; But the truth of it is in reality, if
[1:43:10] that's what God wants from my life,
[1:43:12] Brother Jason, as much as it hurts my
[1:43:14] feelings, I want to fulfill that word.
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; Now, most message preachers want to cast
[1:43:19] out devils. They want to heal the sick.
[1:43:20] They want to raise the dead. They want
[1:43:22] to have a great supernatural ministry.
[1:43:23] But how many message preachers want to
[1:43:25] be persecuted, run down, talked about,
[1:43:27] they want their face plastered on
[1:43:29] YouTube,
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; They want videos made about their
[1:43:32] preaching. I don't like that myself.
[1:43:34] Y'all y'all brothers like that? Y'all
[1:43:36] like having people run you down and
[1:43:37] telling lies on you? Nope. But you know
[1:43:39] what? Somebody's got to do it. If God
[1:43:41] wants to allocate that word to my life,
[1:43:43] then forget what I want. Forget what I
[1:43:46] think. Forget my personal preference.
[1:43:49] Well, come on. Let's have church this
[1:43:51] morning. What about it, young people? If
[1:43:53] God is looking for a young lady that he
[1:43:56] can be able to identify himself with and
[1:43:59] let her walk through Walmart and her
[1:44:01] long hair hanging down her legs and the
[1:44:03] world make fun of her. Is there any
[1:44:05] daughters of God here? Say, "Lord, I'll
[1:44:07] take that portion. I'll take that
[1:44:09] portion." What about it, young men? You
[1:44:11] want to live a holy life, a sanctified
[1:44:13] life. You don't want to commit
[1:44:15] fornication before you get married. You
[1:44:17] want to be men that can stand and be
[1:44:19] trusted and want to be men, young men
[1:44:21] that have credibility and character and
[1:44:24] let the world say what they will. Let
[1:44:26] them life. Are there any young men here
[1:44:28] that'll say, "Lord, I'll take that word.
[1:44:32] I'll take that word, Lord. Let that word
[1:44:35] be fulfilled in my life, dear God. That
[1:44:38] if God can take you, he can prove his
[1:44:41] word by you.
[1:44:43] [Applause]
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; We spoke about Samson a little bit last
[1:44:54] night, but today I'd like to take him in
[1:44:56] a little different light. Judges 16:2
[1:45:00] was told the Gazites,
[1:45:02] saying, "Samson is come hither." And
[1:45:04] they compassed him in and laid wait for
[1:45:06] him all night in the gate of the city,
[1:45:09] and were quiet all the night, saying,
[1:45:10] "In the morning, when it is day, we
[1:45:13] shall kill him."
[1:45:15] That's the way the enemy does, you'll
[1:45:19] lay low and lay a trap,
[1:45:22] and then they make their brag. And
[1:45:24] Samson laid on midnight and arose at
[1:45:27] midnight and took the doors of the gate
[1:45:29] of the city and the two posts and went
[1:45:32] away with them bar and all and put them
[1:45:36] upon his shoulders and carried them to
[1:45:39] the top of the hill that is before
[1:45:42] Hebron.
[1:45:44] Now I quoted it last night. I said it
[1:45:46] weighed 2 thou 2,000bs. It wasn't.
[1:45:48] Actually I quoted that wrong. They
[1:45:50] carried those gates 20 miles on his
[1:45:53] shoulders.
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; That's how far it was from Hebron to
[1:45:57] Gaza. Just so you know, it's the same
[1:46:00] Gaza today that they're fighting over.
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; Very same one.
[1:46:06] So, this was an emblem of Christ's
[1:46:09] resurrection. Even brother Brandham
[1:46:12] talks about it. And yet, he himself goes
[1:46:15] in there. What's God going to do? Prove
[1:46:18] his word. So the gates of Gaza were
[1:46:22] actually called the gates of hell.
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; The gates of hell. So Samson goes and
[1:46:29] takes the gates of hell and setting up a
[1:46:32] shadow or a type of our Lord Jesus to be
[1:46:36] able to conquer death, hell, and the
[1:46:39] grave.
[1:46:40] Now,
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; I want you to notice this that these
[1:46:43] gates actually weighed an estimate they
[1:46:45] found just recently by archaeological
[1:46:47] digs and they found the part of the the
[1:46:50] remnants of those gates and the gates
[1:46:52] and the posts that they said would have
[1:46:54] been between 5 and 10 tons. So total
[1:46:58] with the gates, it was 10 to 20,000 lbs.
[1:47:03] And Samson carried the gates to Hebrron,
[1:47:06] which was 20 miles away of an elevation
[1:47:09] of 3,200 ft higher from where he wound
[1:47:12] up than where he started. Why? Because
[1:47:14] Samson was a mighty man. The prophet
[1:47:16] tells us what Samson was. He was a
[1:47:18] curly-headed little shrimp. And he
[1:47:20] called him a mama's boy. A curlyheaded
[1:47:23] shrimp. Now you think that he went to
[1:47:25] the gym like brother Diggs does.
[1:47:29] They didn't have no gyms in Samson's
[1:47:31] day. That wasn't a miracle. But if we
[1:47:33] look at Samson tonight
[1:47:36] have little curly locks hanging down his
[1:47:38] head. Most of you boys would laugh at
[1:47:39] him. Said you little I wouldn't
[1:47:41] call him that when the anointing come on
[1:47:43] him though, would you? Why? Because God
[1:47:47] had a word that was allocated through an
[1:47:50] angel messenger to Monoah, his father,
[1:47:54] and to his mother. And there wasn't no
[1:47:57] one else that could fulfill that word.
[1:47:59] Now, we looked at it last night. Samson
[1:48:02] never fully gave his heart to the Lord,
[1:48:04] but what he gave to the Lord, the Lord
[1:48:07] certainly used, didn't he? And if God
[1:48:09] could use that out of Samson, what can
[1:48:12] God do through us? Now you can imagine
[1:48:14] these gates by the estimated weight and
[1:48:17] size and the post that they found they
[1:48:19] would have had to been around 10 foot
[1:48:21] high and 10 foot wide
[1:48:27] packed by a curly-headed shrimp
[1:48:31] 4t high himself. Why? God was going to
[1:48:35] keep his word.
[1:48:37] Now remember, in spite of our failures,
[1:48:40] in spite of our shortcomings, he does
[1:48:42] it. Listen how the prophet talks about
[1:48:44] Samson and a prophet. Oh my. He said
[1:48:46] more than a prophet. He was more than
[1:48:48] that. Talking about Jesus. He said all
[1:48:51] but this man took the keys death hell in
[1:48:54] the grave like Samson did the gates of
[1:48:57] Gaza. He took it out. Took the sting and
[1:49:01] death itself and swallowed up in
[1:49:03] victory. And and oh how we thank God for
[1:49:06] what our Lord Jesus did. Don't we
[1:49:08] appreciate that? But what I find amazing
[1:49:11] is that Paul in referring to the
[1:49:13] resurrection and the rapture said, "Then
[1:49:16] shall be brought to pass this saying
[1:49:19] that death is swallowed up in victory."
[1:49:22] Then my question for you is why did not
[1:49:25] the Lord Jesus fulfill that verse?
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; You mean to tell me that portion of the
[1:49:31] word, death is swallowed up in victory,
[1:49:34] the Lord Jesus never fulfilled that? No,
[1:49:37] it was not his word.
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; It's yours.
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; You know that man that sat at the gate
[1:49:45] that was lame? You know that man sat
[1:49:47] there and was sitting there when the
[1:49:49] Lord Jesus was on the earth.
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; How many days did the Lord Jesus pass
[1:49:55] right by that man? Hallelujah. But you
[1:49:59] imagine him saying, "I'm going to save
[1:50:01] this one for my boys."
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm going to save this one
[1:50:06] for my boys. Hallelujah. Don't you see
[1:50:10] how much he wants us to be a part of his
[1:50:13] kingdom? He could have done all the
[1:50:15] preaching. He could have done all the
[1:50:17] counseling. He could have done it all
[1:50:18] himself down through time. Eliminated
[1:50:21] all of our jobs, brothers. And he could
[1:50:23] have done it all. I'm going to be the
[1:50:24] apostle. I'm going to be the pastor. I'm
[1:50:27] going to be the teacher in every church
[1:50:28] age. I'll come down and I'll do it
[1:50:30] myself. But he said, "That ain't the way
[1:50:32] I want to do it. I want my boys to be a
[1:50:35] part of my kingdom. I want my sons to be
[1:50:38] a part of my economy. And yes, they're
[1:50:40] going to make mistakes and they're going
[1:50:42] to have bad judgment at time. But in
[1:50:44] that, I'll come right back around and
[1:50:46] deliver them. And I will prove my power
[1:50:49] through them. Even though they're going
[1:50:51] to fall and make mistakes, he knew you
[1:50:54] would fall short of the glory of God.
[1:50:56] That's why he had John to write this in
[1:50:59] the word. Little children, I write unto
[1:51:01] you that we sin not. But if any man sin,
[1:51:04] we have an advocate with the father,
[1:51:06] which is Jesus Christ the righteous,
[1:51:08] which is the perpetuation of our sins,
[1:51:10] and not ours only, but the sins of the
[1:51:13] whole world. He don't want you to do
[1:51:15] wrong, but he knew you'd mess up, but he
[1:51:18] also gave you a way back. And when you
[1:51:21] come back, you're still fulfilling
[1:51:23] scripture. You're still fulfilling
[1:51:25] because you're being cleansed by the
[1:51:28] washing of the water of the word.
[1:51:34] Hallelujah.
[1:51:39] &gt;&gt; Now, let me move to one of my favorite
[1:51:41] characters of the Bible.
[1:51:44] Probably a lot of you as well. Little
[1:51:46] David.
[1:51:48] I love this little guy.
[1:51:51] He was quite
[1:51:54] quite amazing, quite simple. The Bible
[1:51:57] says he was ready. R U D Y which means
[1:52:02] kind of reddish skinned maybe not a
[1:52:06] handsome so much sort of a fella little
[1:52:09] scrawny guy.
[1:52:11] Now notice in 1st Samuel 17:4, "And
[1:52:15] there went out a champion
[1:52:18] out of the camp of the Philistines named
[1:52:20] Goliath." Now young people, I'm not here
[1:52:23] today to magnify the devil or his
[1:52:25] demons,
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; brother. But I am here to let you know
[1:52:28] we have quite an adversary.
[1:52:31] &gt;&gt; And Peter tells us about that adversary.
[1:52:34] And he said he goes about as a roaring
[1:52:37] lion.
[1:52:39] But you know, if you know anything about
[1:52:41] lions, you know that whenever they're on
[1:52:42] the attack, I was in the Serengeti
[1:52:45] several years ago in a safari
[1:52:49] and riding with a brother who was a game
[1:52:51] warden of the Serengeti, a message
[1:52:53] brother.
[1:52:54] and we come out and we could go with him
[1:52:57] in places that everybody else couldn't
[1:52:58] go. So, we go out through the plains of
[1:53:00] the Serengeti. We actually get to take a
[1:53:02] balloon ride over it as well. But we're
[1:53:04] out there riding and I I see this this
[1:53:07] lioness and she's laying up upon a an
[1:53:10] antill. And there are some of those
[1:53:12] antills can be 8, 10, 12t high, but this
[1:53:15] one was about three and a half feet. And
[1:53:17] I saw the gazelle, the impala, the
[1:53:20] gimsbuck, the different animals that
[1:53:22] were around. And this lioness was laying
[1:53:25] like in the edge near some acacia trees.
[1:53:28] And I asked the brother, I said, "Why is
[1:53:30] she laying right right in the in the
[1:53:33] open like that? What is she doing?" And
[1:53:35] he said, "She's only a decoy." So he
[1:53:38] took his binoculars and he started
[1:53:41] scanning around and looking and looking
[1:53:43] and there's lots of tall grass, yellow
[1:53:46] tall grass. And the color of the the
[1:53:48] skin, the hair of the lion will merge
[1:53:51] right into the color of the grass. He
[1:53:52] said, "Right here. Here. Let me." So he
[1:53:54] gave me the glasses and I looked and
[1:53:56] whenever I saw there was all the rest of
[1:53:59] them and they were laying down, hunched
[1:54:01] down
[1:54:03] &gt;&gt; starting to move,
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; And they were heading toward all of
[1:54:07] those animals that were there. And they
[1:54:10] all had their eyes on that one. And
[1:54:13] where he found them was over here behind
[1:54:15] them.
[1:54:17] Not one of those hundreds of animals
[1:54:20] was looking in that direction.
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; And there was the enemy sneaking up
[1:54:26] behind them.
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; But they had a decoy.
[1:54:29] &gt;&gt; Now remember that Peter said he is as a
[1:54:33] roaring lion.
[1:54:35] &gt;&gt; But you know how the lion attacks,
[1:54:37] crouching, sneaking.
[1:54:40] Oh my. That's our enemy. But greater is
[1:54:43] he that is in you than he that is in the
[1:54:47] world. But my point is, don't just watch
[1:54:50] this area and that area and that area,
[1:54:53] but watch all around you. Because our
[1:54:56] enemy has done this for thousands of
[1:54:58] years. Remember, our enemy today are the
[1:55:01] same demons that come against the people
[1:55:03] in Noah's day, in Lot's day, in
[1:55:06] Abraham's day, in Wesley's day. They are
[1:55:10] experienced. They have been fighting
[1:55:13] human beings and defeating them by the
[1:55:16] billions
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; for thousands of years.
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; And you're some of you are 18, 20, 25.
[1:55:24] How in the world could you ever face
[1:55:26] such experienced
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; beings?
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; Well, because you're serving a more
[1:55:34] experienced God. That's how.
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; Now, if you try it on your own, you're
[1:55:38] going to be defeated. Now
[1:55:41] I want you to notice how the writer of
[1:55:43] Samuel describes Goliath that he was a
[1:55:48] champion.
[1:55:49] &gt;&gt; A champion out of the camp of the
[1:55:52] Philistines named Goliath of Gath whose
[1:55:55] height was six cubits and a span.
[1:55:57] Anybody know what the word Goliath
[1:55:59] means? Splendor.
[1:56:03] The devil knows how to name his boys,
[1:56:05] don't he? So six cubits in a span would
[1:56:09] have been 9 feet and 9 in
[1:56:14] 9 ft and I'm about 6 foot. So you
[1:56:16] imagine three foot added to my height.
[1:56:21] Now he had a big old massive head.
[1:56:25] His fingers were 14 in long. You imagine
[1:56:29] that dude had eyeballs about that big
[1:56:31] around. I mean, they just be down on
[1:56:33] you.
[1:56:35] And boy, when he come out, boom, boom,
[1:56:39] boom, boom, boom.
[1:56:43] All he had to do was appear and
[1:56:45] everybody else disappeared.
[1:56:48] &gt;&gt; Anybody ever faced a champion like that?
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; Come on, brother.
[1:56:51] &gt;&gt; Some of you brothers, you're still
[1:56:52] battling pornography. You're battling
[1:56:54] lust. You're battling this and that.
[1:56:56] Remember, it's the same demons that was
[1:56:58] allocated out of hell that have come
[1:57:00] against many of our brothers down
[1:57:02] through the ages before us.
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; They know exactly what they are doing.
[1:57:06] But so do we. We are not ignorant
[1:57:11] concerning Satan's devices. This is one
[1:57:14] thing we want you to leave with after
[1:57:16] these series of meetings that you are
[1:57:18] equipped because your battles will come
[1:57:21] and your difficulties will come. But we
[1:57:24] don't have to leave in fear and we don't
[1:57:26] have to say, "Well, I'm going to I'm
[1:57:27] just going to stay here at the camp
[1:57:28] forever." No. Remember Moses up on top
[1:57:31] of the mountain and the very hand of God
[1:57:33] come down and wrote the law. And when he
[1:57:35] come down off of that, what was he
[1:57:37] facing? The rebellion of the people and
[1:57:39] the idolatry of the people. Even his own
[1:57:42] brother made idols and said, "These be
[1:57:45] thy gods, oh Israel. Come straight out
[1:57:47] of the presence of God right down to a
[1:57:50] turmoil. Only God knows what each of you
[1:57:52] will face when you go back home. But let
[1:57:54] me give you a word today from the Lord.
[1:57:57] I will never leave thee, nor will I
[1:58:00] forsake thee. I will be with thee all
[1:58:03] the way to the end of the world. No
[1:58:05] matter what you go through, Jesus is
[1:58:08] going to help you.
[1:58:14] &gt;&gt; Now, let's look at this guy. Verse five.
[1:58:16] and he had a helmet of brass upon his
[1:58:19] head and he was armed with a coat of
[1:58:22] male. The weight of the coat was 5,000
[1:58:26] shekels of brass.
[1:58:29] So he has a 30B
[1:58:32] helmet on his head. You imagine packing
[1:58:35] that thing around all day. Now in verse
[1:58:38] six, he had grieavves of brass upon his
[1:58:42] legs and a target of brass between his
[1:58:45] shoulders. So Goliath wore a bronze
[1:58:48] helmet and a coat of scale armor like
[1:58:51] fist scales weighing 5,000 shekels which
[1:58:54] is 125 pounds.
[1:58:58] That's more than David weighed.
[1:59:01] Brother Bam said he weighed 110.
[1:59:05] So just just this outweighed David. If
[1:59:10] they would stand and give you their
[1:59:12] resume,
[1:59:13] &gt;&gt; it would scare us to death.
[1:59:16] &gt;&gt; Cuz they could say, "I talked this man
[1:59:18] into doing this, and I talked this
[1:59:20] mighty man into doing that. I done this,
[1:59:22] and I've done that, and you think you're
[1:59:24] going to face me."
[1:59:28] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:59:30] &gt;&gt; Well, should we all just camp out in
[1:59:32] here and not leave?
[1:59:35] &gt;&gt; Could all the cooks bring us something
[1:59:37] to eat so we don't starve to death while
[1:59:38] we're in here? tomorrow. Just stay in
[1:59:39] here and huddle up in a huddle.
[1:59:40] &gt;&gt; Watch it, brother. Watch it. Watch it.
[1:59:43] &gt;&gt; That's not what you're called to do.
[1:59:46] &gt;&gt; You're another generation.
[1:59:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, we know the third
[1:59:51] generation, the fourth generation, and I
[1:59:52] believe that. But I also know there has
[1:59:55] always been exceptions in every one of
[1:59:57] those generations. And we are the
[1:59:59] exception, young people. There will be
[2:00:01] some, there is no doubt about it. There
[2:00:03] will be some in the third and fourth
[2:00:04] generation in the message that will go
[2:00:07] that way. But that don't have to be you.
[2:00:09] It will only be you if you choose to go
[2:00:13] that way
[2:00:15] &gt;&gt; right
[2:00:17] &gt;&gt; now. It has a long spear and it has a
[2:00:20] 15B iron tip on the end of it. You
[2:00:25] brothers that bow hunt, can you imagine
[2:00:27] shooting something like that?
[2:00:31] and all his armor would have weighed in
[2:00:34] the neighborhood of about 200 lb.
[2:00:38] Now notice in verse 7, and the staff of
[2:00:40] his spear was like a weaver's beam, and
[2:00:44] his spear head weighed 600 shekels of
[2:00:46] iron, and one bearing a shield went
[2:00:49] before him. I love the way brother
[2:00:51] Renham describes him. and three kinds of
[2:00:52] believers. A great big giant like that
[2:00:55] walking up with a weaver's needle, which
[2:00:58] they claim to be around 20 feet.
[2:01:01] So he could stand right here and shave
[2:01:03] you, brothers.
[2:01:05] He could stand right here and cut your
[2:01:07] coat off and cut the cuffs out of your
[2:01:09] shirt.
[2:01:11] &gt;&gt; And you've got what?
[2:01:14] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:01:21] Bless.
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; And actually, this one came
[2:01:30] from the little creek where David picked
[2:01:32] his up at.
[2:01:35] I was there several years ago and got
[2:01:37] several pockets full.
[2:01:42] &gt;&gt; In the valley of El.
[2:01:47] Now ask yourself,
[2:01:49] what would that be in comparison
[2:01:54] to a spear
[2:01:56] &gt;&gt; 20 ft long, 15 pound broadhead? Every
[2:02:00] buck in the country would take off
[2:02:01] running, wouldn't he? A helmet 30 lb and
[2:02:05] you are going to throw something like
[2:02:08] this at him.
[2:02:13] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[2:02:16] He had a 20ft spear in his hand. A man
[2:02:18] like that could stand there and pick up
[2:02:20] a dozen men and throw them. Look at
[2:02:25] verse eight. He stood and cried unto the
[2:02:27] armies of Israel and said unto them,
[2:02:29] "Why are you come out to set the battle
[2:02:31] in array? Am not I Philistine, you
[2:02:34] servants of Saul? Choose you a man for
[2:02:38] you and let him come down." So, a
[2:02:41] nonarmored Goliath would have weighed
[2:02:44] approximately 760
[2:02:48] pounds.
[2:02:56] &gt;&gt; Some of y'all saying that ain't nothing
[2:02:58] compared to the Goliath Iway face. He's
[2:03:00] 1500. He's 2,000. He's 2500. It don't
[2:03:04] make no difference if he if he looks
[2:03:06] like 5,000 lbs. God can still whoop him.
[2:03:10] And you can too, young people.
[2:03:13] Hallelujah.
[2:03:17] &gt;&gt; So, a nonarmored Goliath would have
[2:03:20] weighed around 6760
[2:03:22] lbs. Adding the weight of his armor,
[2:03:24] another 125 or so, would have been 885
[2:03:28] lbs. With his spear, shield, helmet, he
[2:03:32] would have been easily 900b.
[2:03:37] And you're 110.
[2:03:40] with your daddy's shoes on,
[2:03:43] which gives you more weight. And he took
[2:03:45] his staff in his hand and chose him,
[2:03:48] notice now verse 40, this is what David
[2:03:50] did, five smooth stones out of the
[2:03:54] brook, and put them in a shepherd's bag,
[2:03:56] which he had, even in a script, and his
[2:04:00] sling was in his hand, and he drew near
[2:04:03] to the Philistine.
[2:04:06] This boy must be nuts.
[2:04:12] Hallelujah.
[2:04:15] &gt;&gt; He was determined to use what he was
[2:04:18] familiar with.
[2:04:20] &gt;&gt; Now friends, remember the prophet said,
[2:04:22] "The only weapon the devil has
[2:04:26] is to try to make you doubt your
[2:04:29] weapon."
[2:04:29] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:04:31] &gt;&gt; Now, we make Satan almost omnipotent on
[2:04:34] the mission. We got we give him all
[2:04:36] these attributes and he is not any of
[2:04:38] that. He's not all knowing. He is not
[2:04:41] omnipresent. He's not all of that. And
[2:04:44] he has no power
[2:04:47] against you. The power he's got is to
[2:04:49] get you to doubt your smooth stone.
[2:04:52] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:04:55] &gt;&gt; Well, I don't mind telling you he's got
[2:04:57] a lot to use against us.
[2:04:59] I never weighed this particular one
[2:05:01] because I've got several back there in
[2:05:03] my briefcase. But a few ounces, maybe
[2:05:07] a few ounces. What would that be? Now,
[2:05:10] psychologically, I'm going to sit down
[2:05:12] and do the maths and the equation. What
[2:05:15] would be the odds David would win?
[2:05:20] &gt;&gt; What's going to be the odds that you're
[2:05:22] going to overcome these demons which
[2:05:24] have been loosed out of hell? As far
[2:05:26] back as 1961, the prophet said, "The
[2:05:29] lid, the lid has been tore off the
[2:05:33] kettle
[2:05:34] &gt;&gt; and demon powers are streaming in every
[2:05:37] direction."
[2:05:40] &gt;&gt; And what are the odds that you and I
[2:05:43] could face champions?
[2:05:45] Cuz that's what they are in their ranks.
[2:05:48] But God loves to take young people
[2:05:53] &gt;&gt; and defeat Goliath.
[2:05:55] Now listen to me. Goliath was a
[2:05:58] teenager.
[2:06:00] He was not an agent ancient preacher
[2:06:02] that had been preaching for 45 years.
[2:06:04] Glory to God. I've been around and I've
[2:06:07] seen this and I've done that.
[2:06:09] Hallelujah. But he's a teenage boy.
[2:06:12] &gt;&gt; Teenager. Yes, sir.
[2:06:13] &gt;&gt; But David had a word from God,
[2:06:15] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:06:16] &gt;&gt; And Saul couldn't fulfill it.
[2:06:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:19] &gt;&gt; Now, the battlefield is in the valley of
[2:06:21] Eli. Now notice in verse 41. And the
[2:06:24] Philistine came and drew near unto
[2:06:28] David. Big mistake.
[2:06:32] And the Philist and the man that bear
[2:06:34] the shield went before him. And when the
[2:06:37] Philistine looked about and saw you,
[2:06:42] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:06:44] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
[2:06:45] &gt;&gt; He disdained
[2:06:48] him. Look at the meaning of the word
[2:06:50] there. Disdain. to despise, hold in
[2:06:54] contempt,
[2:06:55] to be despicable,
[2:06:58] to be vile,
[2:07:00] worthless.
[2:07:05] For he was but a youth.
[2:07:09] I want you to think of it, you young
[2:07:11] people. As far as we know, David never
[2:07:14] got to go to a youth camp.
[2:07:19] Can you imagine if David would have been
[2:07:21] here this weekend? The deacons had had
[2:07:23] to take him out of the church.
[2:07:25] &gt;&gt; I mean, when this music got to going and
[2:07:27] you you got to swinging around and
[2:07:29] praising God and waving your hand, he'd
[2:07:31] have been running around here
[2:07:32] everywhere. He was an odd sort of a
[2:07:34] peculiar type of a guy that loved
[2:07:37] worship. He loved going to church and he
[2:07:39] didn't even have the Holy Ghost. Can you
[2:07:42] imagine if David would have been here
[2:07:43] and brother Ronnie opened that service
[2:07:45] up and brother Diggs preached and
[2:07:47] brother Paul did here and David would
[2:07:49] have been running and screaming said,
[2:07:50] "What in the world is the matter with
[2:07:52] you young people? What in the world is
[2:07:54] the matter with you?" And I stood there
[2:07:56] that day in the valley of El. I stood by
[2:07:58] myself. I had no brothers. I had no
[2:08:01] sisters. I stood by myself. My brothers
[2:08:04] was against me. My king was against me.
[2:08:07] Anybody with common sense was against
[2:08:09] me. You young people, they've had this
[2:08:11] youth camp for you. Oh my. What would
[2:08:14] David tell you? Rise and take the rocks
[2:08:17] out of your pockets. Take the rocks out
[2:08:20] of your pockets, young people. Take your
[2:08:23] script, take your weapons, take what
[2:08:26] God's given you, and leave this camp
[2:08:28] today and face your enemy.
[2:08:32] [Applause]
[2:08:41] And the Philistines said unto David,
[2:08:45] "Am I a dog?"
[2:08:48] David could have said, "Amen."
[2:08:56] That thou comest to me with staves.
[2:08:59] And the Philistine cursed David
[2:09:04] by his gods.
[2:09:09] And the Philistines said to David, "Come
[2:09:10] to me and I'll give thy flesh unto the
[2:09:12] fowls of the air and to the beasts of
[2:09:15] the field."
[2:09:17] Then said David to the Philistine, "Thou
[2:09:19] comest to me with a sword and with a
[2:09:22] spear and with a shield." What you
[2:09:25] notice, David doesn't mention an extra
[2:09:27] extra extra large sword or an extra
[2:09:30] extra extra large spear. He just puts it
[2:09:32] in the same category. spear, sword,
[2:09:34] whatever, broadhead, you know, here you
[2:09:36] come. Oh, hallelujah. You know, it all
[2:09:39] depends upon how you're looking at your
[2:09:41] enemy. Saul looked at him and said,
[2:09:43] "Lord have mercy. How in the world could
[2:09:46] anybody ever face a man like that?" And
[2:09:48] his brothers looked at him and said,
[2:09:49] "Are you out of your mind, David?" But
[2:09:52] you imagine David coming up and look at
[2:09:54] him and said, "Good Lord, brothers, a
[2:09:55] target that big, how in the world could
[2:09:57] you ever miss him?" Amen. and he's a big
[2:10:00] old guy, but I figure the bigger they
[2:10:02] are, the harder they fall. When God
[2:10:04] brings him down, it will be a testimony
[2:10:07] to the power of God. Oh, yo people, how
[2:10:10] are you going to face your champion? How
[2:10:13] are you going to face your Goliath?
[2:10:15] Don't make his boast big. Don't make his
[2:10:18] equipment against you big, but
[2:10:20] acknowledge the power of God, the
[2:10:22] resurrection of God.
[2:10:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:31] Hallelujah.
[2:10:32] &gt;&gt; And David said to the Philistian, "Thou
[2:10:34] comest to me with a sword
[2:10:37] &gt;&gt; and with a shield, but I come to thee in
[2:10:39] the name of the Lord
[2:10:41] of hosts."
[2:10:44] Bashim,
[2:10:46] Bashim,
[2:10:48] Jehovah
[2:10:49] of hosts,
[2:10:52] the God of the armies of Israel.
[2:10:57] What did David come in the name?
[2:11:01] I love the way the prophet says it in
[2:11:02] his report. The word interpreted
[2:11:06] &gt;&gt; is the manifestation
[2:11:08] of the name of God.
[2:11:12] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:11:12] &gt;&gt; The Hebrews looked at it different than
[2:11:14] we do to them. The name was a
[2:11:16] representation and attributes of the
[2:11:18] character of the individual. That's why
[2:11:19] they'd rename people sometimes because
[2:11:21] they realized they had the wrong name
[2:11:22] when they were born and it didn't match
[2:11:24] who they really were. We had the wrong
[2:11:26] name, too. That's why the prophet in the
[2:11:28] Siluku said, "I no longer call you
[2:11:30] church, but I call you bride." We're
[2:11:33] renamed. Hallelujah. And we're not just
[2:11:36] saying the name of Jesus. We are part of
[2:11:39] that great name because we are his bride
[2:11:42] and he is our bridegroom and we have his
[2:11:44] name. Come on, somebody. That's why he
[2:11:47] said they can yell and scream the name
[2:11:48] of Jesus and they get nothing but we're
[2:11:51] revealed in the thunders. He said, which
[2:11:54] is what? The voice of God uttering the
[2:11:56] message of the day. Listen, young
[2:11:58] people, you're not fighting alone. The
[2:12:00] angels of God are with you. If we could
[2:12:03] have looked down the valley of El, there
[2:12:05] would have been angels on that side and
[2:12:07] that side. All around David, everywhere
[2:12:10] are the angels of God. Why? He's not
[2:12:13] fighting just his own battle.
[2:12:15] &gt;&gt; His victory is going to change everybody
[2:12:18] in the camp.
[2:12:18] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
[2:12:21] [Applause]
[2:12:28] I love this Hebrew word. Your brothers
[2:12:30] probably know it. But what Goliath
[2:12:33] expected from David was certainly not
[2:12:34] what he got because David expressed the
[2:12:37] ineffable
[2:12:39] ineffable
[2:12:40] name which means it's indescribable.
[2:12:45] It's indescribable. It's impossible to
[2:12:48] describe the fullness of the meaning of
[2:12:50] the name. And this boy didn't even have
[2:12:52] the Holy Ghost.
[2:12:57] Let's get this giant killed so we can
[2:12:59] leave.
[2:13:02] Verse 46. This day
[2:13:05] the Lord will deliver thee into mine
[2:13:08] hand, and I will smite thee,
[2:13:13] and take thy head from thee, and I will
[2:13:17] give the carcass
[2:13:20] of the host of the Philistines."
[2:13:23] Now he jumps from one giant to the whole
[2:13:27] army.
[2:13:29] You imagine anybody hear him said he's
[2:13:32] beside himself.
[2:13:34] &gt;&gt; Poor guy. He's gone crazy. I mean, he's
[2:13:37] standing out there and he's attacking
[2:13:38] that now. Every one of us is going to
[2:13:40] pay for this girl. He's brought all this
[2:13:42] down on every one of them. Lord have
[2:13:44] mercy. No, you're fixing to taste his
[2:13:46] victory. What's fixing to happen to you?
[2:13:48] It wasn't God that delivered them
[2:13:49] because of that mighty army and Saul or
[2:13:51] even David's brothers. All he needed was
[2:13:54] one teenager. Lord have mercy. All he
[2:13:57] needed was one teenager that would say
[2:14:00] God can still move and God. Oh, you say
[2:14:03] I revive. Our church don't have a
[2:14:05] revival. Let one teenager full of the
[2:14:08] Holy Ghost leave this camp and go back
[2:14:11] to your church and revival can break
[2:14:14] out. Hallelujah. Revival can break out
[2:14:17] in your family.
[2:14:25] I will give the carcasses of the host of
[2:14:30] the Philist. I want you to notice he's
[2:14:31] describing two different hosts here. Now
[2:14:34] he says the Lord of hosts and then he
[2:14:38] describes the host of the Philistines.
[2:14:41] He knows who's the most powerful.
[2:14:44] I will feed them to the this day, to the
[2:14:46] fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts
[2:14:48] of the field, that all the earth may
[2:14:50] know
[2:14:52] that there's a David in the camp. But
[2:14:54] he's the greatest man of God. I'll tell
[2:14:55] you one thing, he's the
[2:15:04] all the earth may know
[2:15:07] that there is a God
[2:15:10] &gt;&gt; in Israel.
[2:15:14] Your gifts, your gifts, my gifts, all
[2:15:16] the gifts of the brothers, they are not
[2:15:18] for us. They are not to glorify us. They
[2:15:22] are not to edify us. They are that the
[2:15:25] end time may know there is a God in the
[2:15:29] bride. And there is a people on the
[2:15:32] earth that believe he's the same
[2:15:34] yesterday, today, and forever.
[2:15:38] &gt;&gt; It's not for building a kingdom for some
[2:15:40] preacher, right?
[2:15:45] Amen.
[2:15:51] &gt;&gt; From this point on,
[2:15:53] I'm not responsible for my actions.
[2:16:05] &gt;&gt; Go ahead, brother. and all this assembly
[2:16:09] shall know that the Lord saveth not with
[2:16:11] sword
[2:16:13] &gt;&gt; and spear.
[2:16:15] &gt;&gt; For the battle is the Lord's.
[2:16:19] &gt;&gt; That is such a great revelation from God
[2:16:21] for you when you realize demons don't
[2:16:23] hate you because your name is Smith or
[2:16:25] Watkins or Raiken or Brown or whatever
[2:16:27] it is. They hate you because you belong
[2:16:29] to God. Satan has always hated
[2:16:32] everything that God loved. Everything
[2:16:34] that God gave special favor to, Satan
[2:16:37] has hated them. He hates you because you
[2:16:40] belong to God. And that makes your
[2:16:43] battles God's battles. They are not
[2:16:46] yours on your own. But the battle is the
[2:16:50] Lord's.
[2:16:51] [Applause]
[2:16:55] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:16:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:58] &gt;&gt; And he
[2:17:00] will give you
[2:17:02] into
[2:17:04] our hands.
[2:17:07] I can follow a man like this right here,
[2:17:10] but it's not all about him.
[2:17:13] &gt;&gt; Now, all these hours are sending back.
[2:17:23] &gt;&gt; Is that your brother? I don't even know
[2:17:25] that boy. Are you kidding me?
[2:17:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, actually cut the head off that.
[2:17:31] Glory to God. That's my brother David.
[2:17:34] Praise be to God.
[2:17:37] That strength runs in our family. Yeah.
[2:17:39] Right.
[2:17:43] &gt;&gt; But notice a real valiant leader.
[2:17:48] &gt;&gt; He wants the whole army.
[2:17:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:17:51] &gt;&gt; To enjoy the taste of victory.
[2:17:55] &gt;&gt; Young people, the preachers, the
[2:17:57] preachers are not here so that they can
[2:17:59] impress you,
[2:18:00] &gt;&gt; right? that are so you can leave and
[2:18:02] say, "Oh, wow. What great men of God."
[2:18:04] &gt;&gt; They want you to taste
[2:18:06] &gt;&gt; of the victory.
[2:18:09] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:18:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:12] &gt;&gt; He will give you into our hands. And it
[2:18:15] came to pass when the Philistine arose
[2:18:19] and came and drew nigh to meet David
[2:18:22] that David hasted
[2:18:27] &gt;&gt; and ran.
[2:18:30] toward the enemy.
[2:18:33] &gt;&gt; I tell the army of God, no angels, no
[2:18:38] ran toward the army to meet the
[2:18:41] Philistines. One man,
[2:18:43] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:18:44] &gt;&gt; Not even a man, a boy,
[2:18:48] &gt;&gt; a teenager.
[2:18:49] &gt;&gt; Teenager, sir.
[2:18:51] &gt;&gt; You imagine his brother said, I mean,
[2:18:54] he's he's crazy. and him going out
[2:18:56] through there. He must have been drunk
[2:18:58] as a dog on the Holy Ghost.
[2:19:01] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:19:03] &gt;&gt; Where is that devil? I said he's been in
[2:19:05] the wine.
[2:19:07] &gt;&gt; He snuck in the communion wine.
[2:19:09] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry.
[2:19:11] And he's going to go out there. Oh Lord,
[2:19:14] he'll be an absolute embarrassment for
[2:19:16] the rest of my life. He actually made
[2:19:18] their family famous for the rest of
[2:19:19] their life and beyond their life.
[2:19:21] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank God for men of God. Thank God
[2:19:24] for young people. a young boy, young
[2:19:26] girl that's willing to rise above the
[2:19:28] the reproach sometimes that you live
[2:19:30] under your family and under the reproach
[2:19:32] of this and that and said, "That has
[2:19:34] nothing to do with me. That has nothing
[2:19:37] to do with me. God call me.
[2:19:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah."
[2:19:47] &gt;&gt; And David hasted and ran toward the army
[2:19:50] to meet the Philistine.
[2:19:52] Now, I pull my rock out a little bit
[2:19:55] prematurely. Sorry, I got a little bit
[2:19:56] excited there a while ago. So, David is
[2:19:59] actually running toward him and he ain't
[2:20:02] even loaded yet.
[2:20:07] &gt;&gt; Your brother's imagining meeting a big
[2:20:08] old grizzly bear and you're just
[2:20:11] standing up and said, "Come on, big boy.
[2:20:13] I'm going to load up whenever I want
[2:20:15] to." Yeah, right. I hope I ain't hunting
[2:20:17] with you.
[2:20:21] And David put his hand in his bag
[2:20:26] and took fence of stone
[2:20:30] and slang it.
[2:20:32] Now that's the kind of slang I like
[2:20:36] [Laughter]
[2:20:43] and smoke the Philistine
[2:20:47] in his forehead. right?
[2:20:50] &gt;&gt; Which is the only place his helmet
[2:20:53] didn't cover a very very tiny spot.
[2:20:58] And now us brothers, we've got dot
[2:21:00] scopes, we got laser this, we've got
[2:21:02] this, that, and the other, you know, and
[2:21:04] my, we're so proud of our military
[2:21:06] because they've got these smart bombs.
[2:21:08] And God, man, these guys are thousands
[2:21:11] of years behind. God's been using smart
[2:21:13] rocks for years and years and years.
[2:21:17] [Applause]
[2:21:19] Oh, glory.
[2:21:21] &gt;&gt; Now, I bet you David was very good at
[2:21:23] it,
[2:21:24] but it probably outdid his ability.
[2:21:28] &gt;&gt; No doubt you fought many things, but the
[2:21:30] thing you're facing today, it may be
[2:21:32] bigger than you this time.
[2:21:35] &gt;&gt; But don't worry, our God still has
[2:21:38] special armorament.
[2:21:42] &gt;&gt; He took the fence, the stone, and slang
[2:21:44] it and smoked the Philistine.
[2:21:47] in the forehead
[2:21:50] and the stone sunk.
[2:21:56] You talking about crosseyed in a second.
[2:22:04] I want you to notice how he fell,
[2:22:07] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:22:09] &gt;&gt; And he fell
[2:22:11] upon his face,
[2:22:14] &gt;&gt; right? With this velocity,
[2:22:18] there's no way he should have fallen on
[2:22:21] his face.
[2:22:24] He's been hit
[2:22:27] by a smart bomb from God,
[2:22:32] which was moving at 1,000 miles a
[2:22:37] second.
[2:22:41] &gt;&gt; Brothers, what would you pay for that
[2:22:42] kind of bullet?
[2:22:45] or said, "Where'd you get that?" I get
[2:22:46] it from the prophet of God. Cuz he said
[2:22:48] he set that loose and the Holy Ghost got
[2:22:50] a hold of that little stone and he
[2:22:52] picked up a speed of about a thousand
[2:22:54] miles a second and struck that giant
[2:22:56] right between the face and he fell
[2:22:58] forward.
[2:22:59] You imagine a thousand miles a second?
[2:23:02] Those of you brothers that hunt and you
[2:23:03] know that you hit a deer and oh
[2:23:05] sometimes it'll knock it or whatever. My
[2:23:07] I've shot animals in Africa and whenever
[2:23:09] you hit them it'll blow them plum off of
[2:23:11] their feet. You imagine something a
[2:23:13] thousand miles a second even with
[2:23:15] something no bigger than this. All
[2:23:17] science and all mechanics and all
[2:23:19] everything else should have he should
[2:23:21] have fell backward. But God said I'm
[2:23:23] going to humiliate you in your death cuz
[2:23:26] I'm going to have you bow.
[2:23:30] I'm going to have you fall face forward.
[2:23:33] Not so much to David. Hallelujah.
[2:23:36] But to the God of Israelel.
[2:23:41] Who will bow for listening?
[2:23:51] &gt;&gt; Let's say
[2:23:54] hallelujah.
[2:24:00] May I say
[2:24:06] before the bride leaves this world,
[2:24:09] every devil in hell,
[2:24:11] &gt;&gt; every devil
[2:24:13] &gt;&gt; will have been overcome.
[2:24:16] If one devil
[2:24:19] is left exempted from the bride setting
[2:24:23] her foot in his face and on his head and
[2:24:24] crushing him, that one devil be able to
[2:24:27] march before the throne of God at our
[2:24:29] rapture wedding supper and say blah
[2:24:32] blah.
[2:24:34] Nobody in the bride
[2:24:37] could conquer me.
[2:24:42] But sad to say, we don't get to choose
[2:24:44] our temptations.
[2:24:46] We don't get to choose our faults.
[2:24:48] Brother Bam called it the human grabag.
[2:24:51] For those of you that are tempted
[2:24:53] sexually, let me tell you what God's
[2:24:55] prophet said. He said the Lord Jesus
[2:24:57] suffered
[2:24:58] &gt;&gt; sexual temptation.
[2:25:01] &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, how can overcome?
[2:25:03] He said he was tempted by women.
[2:25:05] &gt;&gt; He was tempted by drinking.
[2:25:08] &gt;&gt; He was tempted in all points like as we
[2:25:10] are.
[2:25:12] Lust will be slain in this last day.
[2:25:17] &gt;&gt; Pornography will be slain in this last
[2:25:19] day.
[2:25:21] &gt;&gt; Suicide will be cl will be slain in this
[2:25:25] last day.
[2:25:27] The spirit that gets on some of our
[2:25:30] young people, mainly our sisters, and
[2:25:32] has them cutting theirel,
[2:25:35] that devil will be slain.
[2:25:38] Remember the man in the tombs cut
[2:25:40] himself. It's not a sign of the spirit
[2:25:43] of God. It is a devil sisters that tries
[2:25:45] to get on you.
[2:25:47] Oh hallelujah.
[2:25:50] Ministers, deacons, trustees, lay
[2:25:53] members, song leaders, every one of us
[2:25:56] together as the army of God will be able
[2:25:59] to look all hell in the face. I won't as
[2:26:02] an individual. you want as an
[2:26:03] individual, but collectively all of us
[2:26:06] will be able to look at all at hell and
[2:26:08] say, "You were defeated."
[2:26:13] You were defeated. Lying, adultery,
[2:26:18] fornication, every devil, there won't be
[2:26:21] one that will escape.
[2:26:23] [Applause]
[2:26:33] So take your rocks out of your pockets
[2:26:37] &gt;&gt; and quit throwing them at each other.
[2:26:44] Use them for what they were given to you
[2:26:46] for.
[2:26:51] &gt;&gt; Don't you know David could have killed
[2:26:52] Saul? Don't you know David could have
[2:26:55] killed his brothers that spoke against
[2:26:56] him? But David knew this rock wasn't
[2:26:59] meant for his brothers.
[2:27:03] &gt;&gt; We need one another like never before.
[2:27:08] &gt;&gt; Let me close.
[2:27:11] To me, it's as it was when Geronimo
[2:27:15] and the Apache Indians had been taken by
[2:27:18] our government. Yes, sir.
[2:27:19] &gt;&gt; They lied to them,
[2:27:21] &gt;&gt; broke their treaties time and time
[2:27:23] again.
[2:27:24] And it was the Cherikawa
[2:27:27] Apaches, some of them that actually led
[2:27:32] the army, the United States Army to get
[2:27:36] Geronimo. They could have never done it
[2:27:38] on their own.
[2:27:40] And their brothers had a hard time with
[2:27:42] that. But you know what they' done to
[2:27:45] them? Whenever Geronimo finally
[2:27:47] surrendered, they put them on the train.
[2:27:48] They're going to send them to Florida
[2:27:50] &gt;&gt; to take them out of their homeland.
[2:27:53] That's exactly what Satan wants to do to
[2:27:55] you young people. He wants to take you
[2:27:57] out of your homeland. The message of the
[2:27:59] hour.
[2:28:01] &gt;&gt; I will fight for my homeland.
[2:28:04] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. I will not sit around
[2:28:07] and be passive. Well, let them say
[2:28:08] whatever they want to say. Let them do
[2:28:10] No, sir. This is my homeland. I will
[2:28:12] fight for it.
[2:28:14] &gt;&gt; I ain't talking about our fists. I'm
[2:28:15] talking about the spiritual battle.
[2:28:24] They put the rest of those Apaches on
[2:28:26] the train
[2:28:28] and they felt like they had betrayed
[2:28:30] them in one sense of the word. You can
[2:28:31] see where they would.
[2:28:34] But they started raising their voices
[2:28:36] one against the other and was going to
[2:28:37] fight. And Geronimo looked at him and
[2:28:40] said, "There's so few of us left.
[2:28:44] &gt;&gt; There's so few of us left. We don't need
[2:28:47] to be fighting one another.
[2:28:52] &gt;&gt; I'm gonna tell you something. You get a
[2:28:53] message preacher against you, that man,
[2:28:56] oh man, he can be quite an enemy.
[2:28:59] &gt;&gt; Don't you see what Satan's done to us?
[2:29:02] Our studies, our capabilities, and if
[2:29:04] we're not careful, we're turn our own
[2:29:05] rocks right against ourselves.
[2:29:09] &gt;&gt; God help us.
[2:29:14] &gt;&gt; Let's marry together.
[2:29:21] How many like to be remembered today
[2:29:22] before the Lord?
[2:29:25] As you leave this place today, young
[2:29:26] people, not just young, but all the rest
[2:29:28] of us.
[2:29:30] Maybe you know that enemy would be
[2:29:32] waiting for us, but that's quite all
[2:29:33] right. By God's grace, we'll face him.
[2:29:36] Honestly, we wouldn't stand before the
[2:29:38] Lord, would we? Would we want to?
[2:29:41] and God have to baby us and protect us
[2:29:43] and keep us in some type of shell. Never
[2:29:46] let hard things come our way. And then
[2:29:47] the martyrs walk up beside us. And after
[2:29:51] all they went through and we stood there
[2:29:52] and say, "Well, you know, I I was such a
[2:29:54] baby. God never could try me." I don't
[2:29:56] want that. No, I'm not asking for
[2:29:59] trouble. No, I'm not. But brother Bram
[2:30:01] said, "When we sit at that table and
[2:30:04] we'll reach across that table and take a
[2:30:06] hold of them battle scarred veterans,
[2:30:10] you remember the story whenever one of
[2:30:13] the great Caesars was going to have a a
[2:30:15] vic victory ride and you know what they
[2:30:18] would do? They would take the kings of
[2:30:20] the cities they' conquered and the men
[2:30:23] of great importance and put them behind
[2:30:26] Caesar's chariot and let them walk up
[2:30:29] through and show them how victorious
[2:30:30] they were. And Caesar was going to
[2:30:32] choose a man of his military that would
[2:30:34] ride with him. So all the generals trim
[2:30:37] their plumes and they polish their
[2:30:40] brass.
[2:30:42] He goes out and looks at him. He walks
[2:30:44] by a guy that's not a general, not a
[2:30:46] great man, scars all over him, wounded.
[2:30:51] And he said, "Where did you get those
[2:30:53] scars?"
[2:30:54] He said, "In the battle for my Lord
[2:30:57] Caesar,"
[2:30:59] he said, "You climb up on the chariot
[2:31:01] and ride with me."
[2:31:05] Hallelujah.
[2:31:07] When that resurrection takes place,
[2:31:08] Paul,
[2:31:11] Antipus,
[2:31:12] all those martyrs will come out of
[2:31:14] there.
[2:31:16] Oh, children, we don't want to rise out
[2:31:20] with no scars on us.
[2:31:23] We want to reach across the table and
[2:31:25] look at one another. And all of a
[2:31:27] sudden, we'll feel this awesome
[2:31:29] presence.
[2:31:30] And we'll look up and here he comes.
[2:31:33] It's Jesus.
[2:31:36] I may be the last one at the end of that
[2:31:39] table,
[2:31:41] &gt;&gt; 1500 miles long and way down at the end.
[2:31:45] I'll sit there and Carol will sit by me.
[2:31:48] &gt;&gt; Our Lord Jesus will come to all you all
[2:31:50] and give you your award and he'll thank
[2:31:53] you for what you've done. He'll work his
[2:31:56] way down and come to me and Carol. And
[2:31:59] as he stands there, my tears rolling
[2:32:01] down my eyes,
[2:32:04] the prophet said he'll take his robe and
[2:32:07] reach up there and wipe them tears from
[2:32:09] your eyes and say, "Don't cry no more,
[2:32:12] child.
[2:32:13] It's over."
[2:32:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, all these battles that you fought,
[2:32:18] young people, all these things that
[2:32:19] you've went through for the cause of the
[2:32:21] Lord Jesus, it'll be worth it then.
[2:32:25] It'll be worth it.
[2:32:28] Heavenly Father, these
[2:32:30] precious darlings of God,
[2:32:36] what a great privilege it's been, Lord,
[2:32:37] to speak to him for just a couple of
[2:32:39] services.
[2:32:41] Dear God, to be able to associate with
[2:32:43] my brethren here.
[2:32:45] I want to stand with him in a former
[2:32:47] fashion the way that brother Brandham
[2:32:49] saw Brother Neville and the different
[2:32:50] people coming up and he said, "Oh, I
[2:32:52] know that brother. I know that brother."
[2:32:55] and watch him go up a young man, his
[2:32:59] mate in his arm,
[2:33:01] and then his name was called.
[2:33:04] He said, "I thought I'd never I'd have
[2:33:06] to walk that way."
[2:33:08] Lord, when all my brothers go up and you
[2:33:10] reward them, Father, and I know what it
[2:33:13] is to be a pastor, to be a preacher when
[2:33:14] much of the burdens that you bear not of
[2:33:16] your own, much of the thing that you go
[2:33:18] through in life, it's not
[2:33:20] self-inflicted. It's not because of
[2:33:22] yourself, but it's because of your
[2:33:25] sheep. But I know you well enough to
[2:33:28] know, Father, you're not beholding to
[2:33:30] any man.
[2:33:32] So one day, these ministers of the
[2:33:34] gospel will walk up. I want to be
[2:33:37] standing near them. Lord, when brother
[2:33:38] Jason, Sister Debbie walk up, these men
[2:33:42] of God and their wives.
[2:33:44] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:33:48] Oh Jesus. And we sat down at that table
[2:33:51] and the tears are wiped from our eyes.
[2:33:55] Oh Lord God, don't let me be missing.
[2:33:57] Father, let me be there that day. Lord
[2:34:00] Jesus,
[2:34:02] how many would say that to the Lord?
[2:34:04] Lord, I want to be there. Raise your
[2:34:05] hand to him this morning. Let heaven see
[2:34:08] your hand lift it up. Let heaven hear
[2:34:10] your voice. Tell him, Lord, I want to be
[2:34:14] there so bad. I want to be there, Lord
[2:34:17] Jesus.
[2:34:19] Oh father, we worship you today. Lord,
[2:34:24] Lord, we would be afraid to face these
[2:34:26] demons on our own, but we don't have to
[2:34:28] face them on our own. We can face them
[2:34:30] with you in us. I commit this camp to
[2:34:33] you, these people, these ministers, all
[2:34:36] the workers, everyone. Father, would you
[2:34:38] bless them? One day when the books are
[2:34:40] open and we'll stand there and this
[2:34:41] meeting will be recalled
[2:34:44] and you'll go to handing out rewards to
[2:34:46] the ministers and all the workers and
[2:34:48] those that serve the food and those in
[2:34:49] the kitchen and you'll not let it go
[2:34:52] unnoticed. Father, for there is a book
[2:34:54] of remembrance written in heaven. We
[2:34:58] love you, Lord Jesus. Keep us by your
[2:35:00] grace. I pray.
[2:35:02] God bless you saints. I love you so
[2:35:04] much.
[2:35:07] The weapon may be formed, but it won't
[2:35:11] prosper.
[2:35:14] Oh, when the darkness falls, it won't
[2:35:17] prevail.
[2:35:21] Cuz the God I serve knows only how to
[2:35:25] triumph.
[2:35:27] Oh my God will never fail.
[2:35:34] Oh my God will never fail.
[2:35:40] Oh, I'm going to see a victory.
[2:35:44] I'm going to see a victory
[2:35:48] for the battle belongs to you, Lord.
[2:35:54] Oh, I'm going to see a victory.

[2:36:14] Jesus.

[2:37:18] Jesus.

[2:37:25] win.
[2:37:27] I'm not backing.

[2:43:20] Thank you for what God did for you,
[2:43:22] spoke to you, changed you.
[2:43:26] Thank you for the healing. How many want
[2:43:28] to say, "Lord, thank you for the
[2:43:29] healing. Thank you for touching my
[2:43:32] heart, speaking to my soul, turning me
[2:43:34] around." Amen. When I think about the
[2:43:37] Lord, it makes me want to shout.
[2:43:42] &gt;&gt; Did you enjoy the w the the the word

[2:43:46] brother Donnie?
[2:43:48] Amen. For pouring his vessel out.
[2:43:52] Amen.
[2:43:57] I believe that the word of the Lord was
[2:43:58] just so just on point this entire
[2:44:02] weekend from the beginning. Brother
[2:44:04] Ronnie, Brother Paul, Brother Diggs,
[2:44:07] Brother Donnie, just all the ministry
[2:44:10] was just laser accurate. How many feel
[2:44:13] that way? I had young people telling me
[2:44:15] that I felt like the whole service he
[2:44:17] was speaking just to me lip to ear just
[2:44:19] my right down my avenue. Well, there was
[2:44:22] a lot of people saying that I think the
[2:44:23] Lord was speaking to every single heart
[2:44:25] speaking to my heart. How many feel
[2:44:28] encouraged? How many feel refilled,
[2:44:30] recharged, ready to go slay your giant?
[2:44:34] How many want to say, "Lord, I'm not
[2:44:35] going to go back. It's when I go back,
[2:44:37] it's going to be different. I'm going to
[2:44:39] be different. Things will be different
[2:44:42] from this night, from this day, and this
[2:44:44] camp forward. I'm going to trust the
[2:44:46] Lord with all of my heart that something
[2:44:48] this weekend has go is going to have an
[2:44:52] eternal impact on my life.
[2:44:56] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Give the Lord another hand.

[2:45:03] Amen. We have some announcements and
[2:45:06] things I want to get to. Amen. this
[2:45:08] morning. Uh, I just want to uh say first
[2:45:11] off, I I just want to give some thanks
[2:45:13] here. We're going to do that for all of
[2:45:15] the hard work. There's so many people,
[2:45:17] so many individuals. I feel like I say
[2:45:19] this like a broken record. Brother, if I
[2:45:22] didn't have you, I I couldn't do camp.
[2:45:24] And I feel like I say that about
[2:45:25] everybody and that's just how it feels.
[2:45:27] There's such an an everyone is so
[2:45:29] integral. First, I would like to give
[2:45:32] you the opportunity to give your thanks
[2:45:35] to brother Ronnie for coming, brother
[2:45:37] Donnie for coming, Brother Diggs for
[2:45:40] coming, Brother Paul for coming. How
[2:45:42] many want to give these brothers,
[2:45:45] for all of the labor they poured into
[2:45:47] these services for you young people?
[2:45:52] Amen. Thank you, brothers.
[2:45:57] I'd like all of our counselors that are
[2:45:59] here, come quick. All the counselors
[2:46:01] that are in the building, come quick,
[2:46:03] quick, quick, quick, quick. Come quick
[2:46:04] as you can. Come running, jumping. Get
[2:46:06] up here as fast as you can. Look at this
[2:46:08] great big group. Why don't we give them
[2:46:10] a hand just as they come?
[2:46:14] Come on, brothers, sisters. Want y'all
[2:46:16] to stand out over here. Just want
[2:46:18] everybody to look at you here for a
[2:46:20] moment if you're a counselor. If you're
[2:46:22] not, Amen. Some had to go. different
[2:46:24] reasons, different things. Um, we had
[2:46:26] different brothers and sisters who had
[2:46:28] to just depart for different things.
[2:46:30] They had to be back. Some pastors had to
[2:46:31] be back for their service. And so, I
[2:46:33] just wanted to take a minute. These
[2:46:35] people are so essential to camp. Our
[2:46:38] counselors don't just come. They're not
[2:46:39] just monitors or, you know, uh, scoping
[2:46:42] things out. They're there for you.
[2:46:44] They're there for to minister to you.
[2:46:46] And they that y'all have ministered to
[2:46:47] things that the sermons couldn't
[2:46:49] minister to. But God used you in in in
[2:46:52] your ministry to speak something to
[2:46:54] these young people. How many young
[2:46:55] people want to show how much
[2:46:57] appreciation you have
[2:47:01] for this group? Oh, come on. There.
[2:47:06] Amen.
[2:47:16] Thank you, brothers and sisters.
[2:47:18] Thank you. God bless you. Now you can go
[2:47:20] back to your seat as if you haven't done
[2:47:22] enough walking for for the camp.
[2:47:25] I would like to thank also just for a
[2:47:28] moment I'm just going to say uh such a
[2:47:30] behind the scenes essential team that
[2:47:33] long before you were awake from your
[2:47:35] beds. They were up eating their own
[2:47:38] lunch, their own breakfast, their own
[2:47:39] dinner early five and four and five in
[2:47:42] the morning waking up. I just want to
[2:47:44] say how much we appreciate the work
[2:47:46] crew, the kitchen crew that work the
[2:47:48] kitchen. How many want to say thank you?
[2:47:58] Come on, friends. Give them a real big
[2:48:00] hand clap of praise.
[2:48:04] [Music]
[2:48:07] Amen.
[2:48:10] How many want to thank our musicians
[2:48:12] that they've sat here night after night
[2:48:15] bleeding hands?
[2:48:23] How many want to thank our audio video
[2:48:25] team? Let me stop stop before you start.
[2:48:27] Let me just say this team is so behind
[2:48:29] the scenes and absolutely essential that
[2:48:32] they were here not just at camp.

[2:48:36] special recognition, has done so much
[2:48:39] for this camp. Came a week before this
[2:48:43] youth camp to help us in our church. Got
[2:48:46] here on Wednesday with me and has worked
[2:48:48] tirelessly for hours. But all of the

[2:50:48] say that all concessions today, um, they
[2:50:51] want me to announce are 25% off except
[2:50:53] dirty soda. Also to be sure to check the
[2:50:56] lost and found. There's a lot of things
[2:50:58] there was. I don't know if there still
[2:50:59] is, but there was iPhones.
[2:51:02] I will sell them on eBay.
[2:51:07] Make sure you get your phone and any of
[2:51:09] the lost. They're going to be on a table
[2:51:11] out in front of Concessions Main Street
[2:51:13] was where Concessions is set up. Uh make
[2:51:15] sure you look through the lost and
[2:51:17] found. We don't want uh to to have to
[2:51:19] deal with that. So, make sure you get it
[2:51:21] if you forgot something on the front
[2:51:23] porch of concessions. It's too much to
[2:51:25] mail back. Way too much. So, it'll go in
[2:51:27] the in the uh in the garbage if you
[2:51:29] don't grab it. So, make sure that you do
[2:51:31] or to go to good use somehow. For the
[2:51:33] things that we could use, we'll use. Um,
[2:51:36] also uh we'd just like to say if you
[2:51:38] could just be helpful to pick up any
[2:51:40] trash you see. We want our reputation to
[2:51:43] to be what it is at Carolina Point. We
[2:51:45] appreciate them providing this facility.
[2:51:47] And so, if you have any garbage that you
[2:51:49] see, just pick it up there. There's
[2:51:51] plenty of food for lunch. Um, we want to
[2:51:53] pray for that before dismissal. Also,
[2:51:56] Brother Brad's going to make uh some
[2:51:58] announcements about the chairs we're

[2:52:34] made wise
[2:52:36] sayings.
[2:52:39] They want me to read some of them. I'm
[2:52:41] debating whether to do that or not. So,
[2:52:45] these are some of the wise sayings from
[2:52:48] team sour candy. Snacks from your enemy
[2:52:52] are worth the carbs.
[2:52:56] From team cool chips, wicked laughter
[2:52:59] will reap the weeds of rumors.
[2:53:02] From team chocolate hot cocoa mix, those
[2:53:05] who sing while wearing headphones only
[2:53:07] solve half the problem.
[2:53:11] from team hot cocoa mix. A blind hog is
[2:53:14] better than a mangy cat
[2:53:17] from team hot chips. Uh shrieking laugh
[2:53:20] takes longer than you might think. Let's
[2:53:23] give them a hand for our wise sayings.

[2:56:37] &gt;&gt; I think I'm good. That boy, that's how
[2:56:39] everybody else feels. That's pretty
[2:56:40] cool. All right. So, this is the hottest
[2:56:43] competition. Good job, Mr. McGary. But
[2:56:46] this is the hottest competition we have
[2:56:49] every year. This is the cleanest room
[2:56:53] competition.
[2:56:54] Can I get a

[2:57:01] are two sets of prizes. There's two for
[2:57:04] the ladies rooms, two for the guys
[2:57:07] rooms. Okay. It was based. This is
[2:57:10] really highly competition. It was based
[2:57:13] on 10 different top secret categories.
[2:57:17] We each category you get five points. So
[2:57:21] the perfect score is 50. We had
[2:57:23] independent judges that came in did it.

[2:57:48] right. The exciting thing is we've
[2:57:52] already secured sponsorship
[2:57:54] for next year.
[2:57:57] So that if your dorm did not win, your
[2:58:01] room did not win this year, next year, I
[2:58:03] would try anyway because next year it's
[2:58:05] going to be big cash prizes. Oo, big
[2:58:09] cash prizes.
[2:58:12] Money, money, money, money.

[2:58:55] that's got all your gift certificates.
[2:58:57] So, if your dorm is called, see your
[2:58:59] counselor afterwards. They have the gift
[2:59:00] certificates. And for the first tumbler
[2:59:03] is with a score of 45.

[3:01:10] dorms

[3:01:29] told me we had a very, very special
[3:01:32] situation. We've never had anybody score
[3:01:36] this before. It's crazy.

[3:02:46] the dispenser.
[3:02:48] They folded their toilet paper
[3:02:52] and they stamped the toilet paper like
[3:02:55] it was in a hotel. They brought in a
[3:02:58] stamp and stamped it. I have seen
[3:03:01] pictures. It is crazy.

[3:04:55] 14
[3:04:57] has a Windex bottle and a paper towel
[3:05:00] cleaning the windows.

[3:05:04] true. So I walk up to that room. I look
[3:05:07] and as when I walk in the shower
[3:05:09] curtains are on the floor. There are

[3:12:30] [Music]
[3:12:35] What a day of rejoicing that will be
[3:12:41] when we all
[3:12:44] see Jesus
[3:12:47] we sing and shout the victory.
[3:12:52] Oh, and while we walk
[3:12:57] over path, we cl
[3:13:01] over spread the sky.
[3:13:05] But when traveling
[3:13:08] days are over,
[3:13:11] not a shadow, not a sign.
[3:13:16] When we all
[3:13:19] get to heaven,
[3:13:22] what a day of rejoicing that's going to
[3:13:26] be.
[3:13:28] Oh, when we all
[3:13:31] see Jesus,
[3:13:34] we'll sing and shout the victory.
[3:13:40] Oh, and while we walk this pilgrim
[3:13:45] pathway, clouds will over spread the sky
[3:13:51] over
[3:13:53] when trampling days are over. Not a
[3:14:00] shadow.
[3:14:03] Oh, when we all
[3:14:06] get to hear him,
[3:14:09] what a day of rejoicing that will be.
[3:14:15] Oh, when we all
[3:14:18] see Jesus,
[3:14:21] we'll sing and shout the victory.
[3:14:26] Onward.
