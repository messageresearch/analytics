we've talked to the camp and they're willing to let us stay on property to do whatever we want to do activity wise outdoors until 5 30 tomorrow so you'll be able to if you haven't had a chance get a little bit more free time and i know that put a lot of smiles on a lot of faces a lot of frowns on others who have to go with by plane or by car but those who are able to stay we're going to stay here

the docks that were right in front of the main lodge we'll do that right after the service we're also going to have a prayer line here tonight and i know that this is just what the lord put upon her heart how to do it you know you come and you congregate and you gather with people from all over the all over the nation and i know that there's i know because some of you has already expressed it that you came here not just not not just to see your friends that's okay but that's not the only reason you came not just enjoy the swing that was really fun the rock wall whatever you got to do today but you came here with more than a natural need but you've got a spiritual need something upon your heart specifically that you're praying over and you've got that on your heart and you've got that need something you want to ask prayer for i believe in the prayer of faith we believe in that we heard it preached thursday night we believe in the power the real power of god moving and so we want we want to make that opportunity tonight for needs that are specific something upon your heart the prayer line will work this way we want to make sure it's done exactly this way when brother john's finished uh and he's finished preaching we'll uh we're gonna sing a few songs uh the brothers will go back here have prayers we've asked certain ministers here uh to be able to come up and pray we're gonna have them lined up um from that uh edge there of the altar one two three four five six i think is what we have uh six uh ministers here we're gonna form a line so the line will start here i don't want you to come up to the altar tonight because that's going to be ministry reserved for prayer line but i want you to form a line at the very back there are starting here going through the back and a deacon right here at the very front before you go to to the to approach any of the ministry the deacon will will will lead you to that or take you to that one brother and each brother is going to pray that way there's a everyone no there's no rush there's no labor there's no anybody getting weary that'd be all right so you i want you to hold that we're going to change the order of the service now i want you to hold that need up right now to raise it before the lord if you got something specific go ahead and raise it up represent it say lord this is what's upon my heart right now and i want to hold it before you as the we change the order of the service hear the preach go ahead and close your eyes everybody every head bowed raise that hand up say lord i'm going to hold that

heart [Music] how many believe there's a mind for every service i i had one song written down to sing tonight and that was the last special that was saying all my life you've been faithful goodness of god is running after us so if you believe the holy spirit already is preparing he's preparing heavenly father we just want to dedicate the service there's been songs and prayers we're ready now lord we're just walking in the front door of past the secretary down the hallway into the room that's been prepared for us privately we come into your presence and we pray your holy spirit would just now take control of every spirit every soul and everybody may this day be long remembered of an evening that you came by our way and you turned on the light you did miracles you did healings you brought life heavenly father we wait upon you we quiet in our spirits now we just pray a blessing lord upon every effort every desire and every prayer every father and mother grandparent every pastor song leader elder that is praying for us even right now may you answer their prayers and send life lord into our wombs in jesus name amen amen i'm going to let you have your seats for a moment just for a moment did you have a wonderful day and we want to thank our brother jason watkins brother matthew watkins and the whole team the bethel tabernacle for giving us such a wonderful eve weekend would you like to express that this might be their first year but the whole team and the whole church has acted like they've been doing this for 20 years and we just pray a blessing on them and the lord would answer their prayers and he's kept you safe today my wife said y'all were really uh going at it hard today and so it's it's easy when we get into a comfortable place like this to maybe feel like we need to rest but can we just do all that next week sometime i promise you tonight i won't be as long as last night we're going to be shorter but we just want the lord to have his way and i put our title on the screen tonight spiritual contractions in your booth and i'd like to read this quote again that we mentioned last night if maybe the brothers could help me go to the next slide we're working on this brother branham said somehow or another i just feel we're going there's something laying right ahead for us just remember i believe i am prophesying great joy lays ahead believe it that's right many saddened hearts will be made great mysteries will be made clear and people who are sad will be turned into joy wouldn't that be wonderful if the lord that that inspiration just settled upon this weekend and god would just turn many hearts into joy now my my little clicker here is not working brother so are we plugged in up there it'll make it easier for all of us if we can tonight god's just going to go to the heart of the matter we can talk a lot about all the things around the issues or the symptoms and we can go through all of that as young people but we've spoken uh the brothers have spoken wonderfully and it seems like restoration is a theme and tonight we'd like to speak about restoration of the booths and many might not maybe understand that or might not have heard it like this before and that's why we're speaking on it and it's a private place it's a personal place that maybe for years has been neglected or lost but god is going to speak on it tonight for us and going to the next slide i can see the brothers are going to have to help me now i understand this is a youth meeting this is young people's weekend but uh we're going to be speaking about spiritual things and i'm asking everyone to be spiritually minded and to be mature i believe the young people the message are ready for the third pool i believe that uh it's time now for all of us to realize what's happening in our lives spiritually is beyond our flesh it's beyond just someone trying to maneuver things or orchestrate it who in this room's ever had a birthday before you have some of you haven't but who's had a birthday before all right what we're speaking about tonight has happened then for each one of us and it's happened to a mother to a lady and that's why we're here that's naturally and so spiritually though there's contractions and there's things that are have been going on in your life and especially in the last months and brother john's just going to labor in this area to help you understand that it's the holy spirit on you it's been his thirst and his uh groaning and his spirit and i know that there's many that are streaming i i heard today from some of your parents some of your grandparents even from other countries that are as we said last night when joel prophesied and talked about your children's children and children we're seeing that manifested right in this weekend brother burley by the cadre by the jason brother matthew we're seeing the word of god made manifest it so in our next slide i wanted you to know that it's the lord jesus that is in control of this surgery how many can see that on the screen the lord jesus is just watching every word he's he's prearranged everything he's allowed things to happen for this moment and when it comes time for the birth nothing's going to stop it when it comes time for it to happen nothing can stop it so tonight i want you just to visualize in your heart it's just like um everyone has come around and we're just standing here like this we're just standing as uh nurses or doctors would around a life that is about ready to have god birth them or heal them or deliver them we've all created the right atmosphere but we're just standing here tonight as his assistants just saying come on you can do this come come forth this is your time this is your birthday this is your season so i want everything has just been right this is the night this is the hour let's stand to our feet and turn to our scripture the brothers can turn to the scripture in john chapter 16. john chapter 16 is the scripture we're taking these two thoughts of spiritual contractions in your booth because it's something that is happening globally but right here tonight in your life into us this day this scripture is fulfilled right in our midst john chapter 16 verse 20 jesus is speaking and in my bible the words of jesus are read and so this the whole scripture tonight is jesus speaking to the young people speaking to us speaking to the bride john 16 verse 20. verily verily i say unto you that ye shall weep and lament but the world shall rejoice and ye shall be sorrowful but your sorrow shall be turned into joy hallelujah a woman when she is in travail we know that a woman is a type of the church or the bride a woman when she is in travail has sorrow because her hour is come but as soon as she is delivered of the child she remembereth no more the anguish for joy that a man is born into the world are you thinking spiritually right now this this child that is being born is christ and jesus is just laying it right out there uh more than just a drama but he's making it real that while we're going through this time of travail and sorrow because our hour is come but as soon as a woman is delivered of this child she remembers no more the anguish it's isaiah said when we are on that other side that none of this will be remembered or even come into our minds nothing negative nothing outside of god's plan will even be able to be in the bride's mind throughout the millennium and throughout our future home can we say thank you jesus no no bad thoughts no memories of any it will not even be remembered or come into your mind all the anguish and trouble verse 22 and ye now therefore have sorrow but i will see you again jesus speaking and your heart shall rejoice and your joy no man taketh from you verse 23 is our last verse and in that day ye shall ask me nothing verily verily i say unto you whatsoever you shall ask the father in my name he'll think about it maybe how many believe that day is this day amen we're living at the time when we are no longer children and adolescents you've come of age and he's not here to stimulate your minds he's here to stimulate your heart to turn you back tonight's message is very a mature message for the believers and here we are for such a time as this god bless you you can have your seats and he read the scriptures and then gave the scroll to the priest and when they had all sat down he began to say unto them this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears tonight we're saying this scripture is being fulfilled within the young people of the message that the promises and the word that has been sown down not just through the ages but in your day is now bursting thus saith the lord for this hour we have been pregnanted with that we've been pregnated by a message of thus saith the lord and it is now coming to the time for a full manifestation paul said it like this in romans that uh the whole earth is groaning they're travailing if someone would be able to take this microphone out tonight to these trees or to the lake out here or to the grass that is now wet with the rain that god's kept from us today gave you a wonderful day did you enjoy the day today but if we could take this microphone out there and say speak give us a voice it wouldn't just be laughing and telling a joke and wanting to watch a movie it would be groaning saying where are the sons of god where are the daughters of god i'm groaning when are they going to grow when are they going to come to maturity when are they going to realize the day and the hour that they're living in i want to say tonight and give a voice back out to them here we are lord amen here we are lord let's not be dull tonight let's not be insensitive to what god is saying to us right now and it's time to awaken our ears our eyes our whole lives and say lord be it unto me according to your word bring forth life we're not here for a party tonight we're not here to just laugh and be funny and be goofy we want the word to connect yes we do with young people but it's got to go beyond the now it's got to stretch into the eternity where lives can be changed forever where this groaning where there's something that can't even be uttered many times from our hearts and i'm gonna come down into your personal life but god is raising up an army tonight and the spiritual contractions that you've been sensing now and they're getting stronger contractions are like cramps is everybody ready to go into the service now what spiritual contractions contractions are cramps they're spasms it's something that's uncontrollable that's happening in your life and they get closer as the time approaches they get closer and it's often associated with pain it's not just always running and joyful and happy but a travail and a sorrow contractions are like there's discomfort it's not easy when you speak about the new birth or new life and every birth has them every single one of you caused pain when you came forth so a contraction is actually can you go like this with your hands it's a it's a tightening then it's a flexing then it's something that's moving like this and i want you to listen really closely spiritual contractions it's a normal part of pregnancy it's something that is happening brother branham said it like this in birth pains that it takes pain it takes distress and it takes discomfort so the gospel isn't always easy it's not always running on the mountains we're on the mountaintop this weekend this is the greatest times of our lives are weekends like this but we've got to leave on sunday afternoon or monday and go down into the valley but it's the valley that he restores our souls no fruit is growing on the mountaintop any farmer anybody will tell you that that raises weed or raises crops that it's down in the in the fertile valley where it grows and so you cannot remain on the mountain we don't want to take away your mountaintop experience and i'm not here to to to water that down but i'm here to let you know that what is happening this contractions and this flexing and cramping that you've been going through in the end of all of that these muscle contractions are what will help you in the labor to push that baby down the birth channel and out so the very pain and the very spasms and and there can be false contractions and there can be you that are in the back you sisters are streaming that's had children know that there can be false contractions and braxton hicks they call it and they're just things that happen and you're just bracing and embracing in your but it just goes it's a false but then there's times when it just builds up and and it builds up and you're able that's what i was speaking about last night just bri okay just breathe and then it's like something in a bit you can just feel the pressure you can feel the pain it's trying to move you into a place you say oh this is bad and this isn't this is uncomfortable but i'm here to tell you tonight that the very thing that has caused this contractions in your spiritual life is going to help you in the labor you needed that to push the baby out the birth canal and to push it out because we've had too many stillborn children in the message or as our brother that sang the special saying for many years he said it was just he was around the message raised in the message but there has to come a time when all of this becomes real [Applause] in john chapter 16 that we read jesus said a woman in travail has sorrow maybe the brothers can put up john chapter 16 again verse 21 a woman in travail has sorrow but there is joy at the birth there's joy when you see a young lady singing a song for the glory of god and some of you are just waiting yeah we know her we know what happened in the cabin or yeah we know that brother and we kind of snicker a little bit but do you know god is actually doing something supernatural even in this atmosphere tonight right now you can feel it's different that's that contraction that's the all the prayers that's all the god has dates circled on his calendar for there to be births for there to be healings for i was listening to brother branham just coming in in our room i'm just forgetting the message maybe it was about samson what was that message brother burley just once more and brother branham said oh i love this he said god is giving you back your right mind he's given you back your mind and as samson was his eyes were out but he was moving there god was giving back his right mind and i thought god do that for our young people tonight restoring to them give them the mind of christ you say my heart is is broken or my heart is wayward or my uh my heart is just brother john i don't even have the desire for god the bible speaks about a person like that and it says i will give you a new heart i will give you a new spirit and i will put my spirit in you boy that would be wonderful tonight if someone within this service god had tonight's date circled on his calendar that this was the whole burden the whole focus of everything was for these moments wouldn't that be wonderful and we could just sense that that a child is being born there's and we just know that there's going to be joy and we know that there's going to be deliverance we know that we're going to go back home different and you say wow their attitude's different you can see there's light around you i can just see their approach that is because god has had his way and the contractions that we've been feeling for months has led up right to this moment her hour is come jesus said and as soon as she is delivered of the child the spoken word of our day god is pregnanted now the bride of christ it's been laying in the womb of this generation when they came out of egypt through moses god thought of the generation that was going to go into the promised land but there had to be fathers there had to be mothers there had to be grandparents there had to be church services for the last 56 years plus since 1965 there had to be a wilderness there had to be a time there had to be another generation there had to be children of children of children to show that god's word is true you ought to be thankful tonight that though your eyes have never seen though you've never heard physically or been in a meeting of brother branham that you can say my eyes have seen i've experienced that the same holy spirit the same angel of the lord that stood in the branham tabernacle in march 1963 is standing behind this pulpit tonight and it's not brother john andes it's the lamb that broke the shield is in this building tonight now i've got to stay focused tonight tonight we've got to be more focused than we were last night god forgive us but i want to spiritual contractions when you speak to young people you're dealing with personal contractions you're dealing with relationship contractions or spasms there there's times when it's good and there's times when it goes opposite and you're dealing with maybe someone's been dealing with relationship contractions or contractions in a certain family i i remember in poland one year when i was preaching there and there was a young lady that came to us it was just in the front of the building it was public but she just began to speak to me she was the only young person in her church there wasn't a bunch of young people there wasn't a big crowd she was the only young person in her youth group and i gave her just a word of encouragement as we spoke i said sister it won't always be like this she lived way up hours away and i mean those type of meetings that we were having were just so sacred and so wonderful to her to be able to come and be with other brothers and sisters but i said it won't always be like this and do you know within less than a year there was another brother that was in the camp meetings and in the convention that was a very i would say he's one of the leading young men and leaders of of the message then and he was just they were out on the streets witnessing they were on fire and they were just and within a year that that young brother and that sister became in a relationship and now they have they're married and have children and when you go to czech republic or go to poland you'll see this couple with their family they're seeing that they're right there as leaders in the message why it's because with a birth comes patience there's a character are you willing to wait until god's time and season in relationship con contractions constructions in a family there's times when there's highs and lows for all of our families there's a time when it rains and it pours and then there's times when the sun comes out and there's a time when you go through the summer i spoke to some of our believers from arizona this week and they were talking about the weather and things and you know it can get really hot in arizona and it can get really cracked in the in the desert and it can get really uh humid in other places but it's not always summer in your life there will be a fall time and there'll be the beauty that you can drive to south carolina and go to a youth camp and the leaves are beautiful is that true and it's wonderful to be here in south carolina just say outside of travelers rest and know that god has prepared a little womb a little sanctuary a few days that we can set up step away from our busyness of life and get plugged into the supernatural how many is thankful for that tonight and out of the womb of this desire is coming a generation and we'll speak on that tomorrow morning the rising generation it's not a generation that is the backslidden generation or the generation that is falling falling but you are a rising generation you are a rapture generation you've been prophesied it is thus saith the lord there will be young people that out of this generation will be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye this this spasm this spiritual contraction is going to birth through your personal contractions your relationship contractions your family contractions your church family goes through times of of of uh great contractions some of you have experienced it in school i know that you that go to public school just wait raise your hand if you go to public school or a college or university just raise your hand i was speaking to a senior brother today wow all the way back to the next back row we got young people god bless you i was listening hearing a testimony today of a minister that's in this building right now and throughout his teenage years and things and though he was in a good church had a good family but it was through the public school and through that influence and i asked the question when was it that you noticed this certain uh wildness and this certain uh he was in sunday school he was good family but it wasn't during that time of public school and that influence that's why i'm speaking about the negative then the positive because we need these positive influences and we need times like this god loves young people in fact god loves youth so much that he said for eternity it's just going to be about 18 or 20 years old god loves youth he loves vitality he loves passion god loves it when young people are passionate young people that are on fire for god god give us more young people that are on fire for god through all your gloom through all the shadows through all your depression through all your anxious nights and your nightmares throughout all of your lack of sleep and your your dreams turn into nightmares and god has seen the travail now i'm coming really down to home god has seen it in your in your contractions in your career as you look for even job brothers or sisters as they go through that time and they begin to spasm oh i know i i should know i have goals and careers and things these are growing pains this is birth pains this is spiritual contractions that is happening to all of us tonight i just feel to go a little bit further before i go to the booths i'm just quivering right here with the holy spirit wanting to say something right now god has brought you from before your birth and he knew everything about you and he allowed you to be in a family i'm just holding the pulpit right here to just steady myself god knew you before you were even in the womb he made sure that you came out of the womb and he sees you tonight and all of the sighing and crying and weeping that you have gone through personally all of the wailing and the travail the old testament says mark those that are shying and crying that have a burden in the message in the city where are those that are interested they're interested in a son being born a daughter being born why is this world so full of feminists and they want to have a career before they have a baby they don't want their bodies to be deformed it shows the spirit of satan that is god on the human race it's a perversion when god is trying to get a bride pregnant with his word you know what i'm talking about tonight and all of the travailing whale now i'm speaking as a minister that's been born and raised in the message and the burden on your heart the groaning behind the scenes of you as a young person on your bed at night in your classroom you you look around and you feel weird you feel strange it's not home to you in your bedroom in your closet maybe you just maybe you have to share with a sister with a brother and maybe you have a little closet or something and god sees you when you close the door god sees you my my mind is just going right now i remember specifically when i was a teenager and i i don't know why i'm going to say this but i was just turned 18 years old and i was a night manager at a grocery store and there'd been something happen at the front and the registers we were open 24 hours and i was checking out some people and i'd put all the money all the cash brother cadre from my collected from all the teals in a grocery bag and i just put it behind me because i was checking out someone and when i turned around it was gone all the checks all the cash oh my this is horrible and i just walked through the store and went back into the back of the restroom i'm just going to be open with you and as i shut the door he was there you know young people he's going to be there you say this is private or you say i'm just going to close the door no god is god knows what you're going through in your closet in your bedroom when you're in your car on your job when you're all alone or when you're with others you sense this travail this burden and you don't know maybe up till tonight what is it why do i feel this way it's spiritual contractions it's that seed inside of you it's that spasming it's that it's that you you cannot control this you you don't know its destiny but god does and i just encourage every person tonight just yield to that let's all say yield and as you've gone through these last years in these last months some of you been isolated and i spent a long time on it last night some of you have been separated from loved ones and distance and it hasn't been normal for none of us but god has seen your travail he's seen your sign even if you parents even of you older ones even churches now even ministers i one of my minister friends that's an elder in this message he was gonna resign after the sunday night service there been so much confusion in the church about you know should we be having services should we not and there's people saying oh i think we should be having services let's have services another said no we shouldn't be having service we're not gonna he was going to resign on the sunday night and there was a visiting minister was in his church brother jason came through that sunday preached the morning and preached tonight and god dealt mightily in that church and in that in that pastor's assembly and he got up at the end of the service the pastor and he said i was going to resign this sunday night but god has changed my heart see it's not just young people that are going through issues it's not just young people we have young people's camps we have young people things but sometimes i wonder if we ought to have 40-0 and a plus and oh would y'all like that just young people aren't the problem they're a product of their families they're a product of their churches i know i need to be careful here friends but i have in my notes written notes that young people thrive under supernatural atmosphere they thrive when the holy ghost is moving [Applause] young people feed on the word they love holy ghost film music they love to be around people that love them people that would die for them they thrive under that but i understand and i wrote this in my notes in washington before i came here many young people that attend special meetings like this go back to a home that does not have a nurturing atmosphere we have great times and brother burley can minister brother cadre is going to minister brother jason and brother matthew he's just done i think he's incredible what brother matthew and i i was with him last night in a personal in a personal time with another brother not just to see the wisdom of god upon his life but i know there's young people here that are not going back to a home that is nurturing they're not going back to an environment that is encouraging them it's they're going back home to people that's going to look down on them and say oh yeah we'll see how you are in three weeks maybe they're going back to an atmosphere even in their church where there's a lot of skepticism and and trouble so god give us a supernatural atmosphere well we're together like this my heart is groaning we all want a revival we all want to see a move of god but are we really willing to be honest enough and humble enough this past year i was speaking to a father in the messaging can i be open tonight we're talking about contractions and we're talking about things we're going through in the message and as young people i was talking to the father and just discussing his teenage daughter she's a beautiful young lady beautiful young teenager raised in a message church and you know i seen her in the meetings and i see her and her family i actually saw her at a place of work where she was and she had earrings on and you could just see through the side of her shirt her bra and everything and she needed the lord but what was so amazing when speaking to her father he was just giving me the testimonies and talking about his family and his life said oh i know she has the holy ghost i know my daughter has the holy ghost and i didn't say anything to my precious brother and friend but i thought are we talking about the same person this person lives with you this person is in your home and yet publicly it's so obvious she's struggling she's not where she's not just struggling she's manifesting a lot she's crying out and i thought god help all of us not to be so deceived we can be right in an environment and think everything's okay and it's not okay just today just between services you know we went back to our room again and and was alone and i was able to view a wedding of brother ben steeman from florida and sister adriana pruitt they were married this afternoon and i thought of these families and thought of a young couple that has been probably influenced most of you and you've been around them or seen their brother danny steeman is the pastor and brother tim pruitt which we dearly love but for them to be married this afternoon and know they can live their lives before they're married and now after they're married we're really quiet tonight but god has given you a virgin womb and he's given you a spiritual virgin womb and we ought to be fighting for that with everything that's within us guard your heart i speak to all of the beautiful young ladies and all the young men guard your heart don't trade it for treasure don't trade it for a job or career a fast car don't let your heart get taken by the world and regret your decisions later this is where we're having these meetings to create an atmosphere around you how many knows what i'm talking about when i say crying out or groaning or travail [Music] it's just is you're passing the birthing room [Music] okay [Music] and you tend to what is it's spasms it is it's it's birth pains it's it's a groaning before we turn to our next scripture about the booths i want to say to everyone here god has heard your cry god has heard your groaning and what you've gone through what you're going through god has heard your cry and he responds to the youth of this message with this answer i hear your cry let's turn to nehemiah chapter one together is everybody doing okay spiritual contractions in your booth i'm sorry let's turn to leviticus 23 first is everybody strong okay there was a young man that kept sleeping through the most of service last night and i mentioned it to my wife i thought and she said are you serious she said if i was a girl looking for a guy i saw him sleeping in church i wouldn't even think about him i'd drop him right now i said my i must have been on the edge of my seats when you married me that's almost 30 years ago and i wanted to mention that tonight about my wife we've been married almost 30 years in january and i thank god for a godly lady that'll stand by you and stand with you and even today again brother matthew she wanted to be here she wanted to be around you and be with the young ladies and young men and be with the sisters i appreciate that i really do leviticus chapter 23 verse 42 the brothers can put this on the screen this is now coming into the second part of our service spiritual contractions in your booth what is a booth leviticus 23 verse 42 this was when the uh the word was being laid out ye shall dwell in booths seven days all that are israelites born shall dwell in booths that your generation may know that i made the children of israel to dwell in booths when i brought them out of the land of egypt i am the lord your god this is incredible this is god laying out in the book of leviticus i want the church i want the believers of the message to know they need to make booths anyone born that's an israelite should dwell in booths then why don't we know what it is why is it like we've never heard of it do you know do you know what friends it's very amazing we're going to turn to nehemiah chapter 8 now this went on for years all the way to the brother joshua and when joshua crushed jordan was 1451 bc now what we're reading tonight is the year 445 over a thousand years later since joshua is everyone listening let's say joshua it wasn't in the message they neglected booths we're going to read it in just a few minutes but for since the days of joshua the son of none until the day had not the children of israel done so it's like what's a booth what the booth we all want revival we all want everyone to have authority and come to your place but if you neglect the booth you're just going to keep going around in circles nehemiah chapter 8 verse 14. now this is ezra standing up behind the pulpit nehemiah 8 14. and they found written in the law this is what was leviticus they found which the lord had commanded by moses that the children of israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh month now if i can just have your attention the seventh month for the jewish race was october this very month that we're in tonight for the jews was a season of the booths and then the feast of tabernacles and verse 14 that we just read was that they found it it's in the book of leviticus what we just read that the children of israel should dwell in booze in the feast of the seventh month verse 15 and that they should publish and proclaim in all their cities in johnson city and florida and phoenix and idaho and south carolina north carolina hello i know those are states but i don't know all the cities you're from but here we are saying go forth unto the mount and fetch olive branches and pine branches and myrtle branches and palm branches and branches of thick trees to make booths as it is written so the people went forth and brought them and made themselves booths everyone upon the roof of his house and in their courts and in the courts of the house of god and in the streets of the watergate and in the street of the gate of ephraim verse 17 and all the congregation of them that were come again out of the captivity made booze or the message struck their hearts everyone started to make booths and sat under the booths for since the days of joshua that's jeshua the son of none until that day had not the children of israel done so and there was very great gladness like it's going to be at the end of the service it's going to be like wow when the word goes forth and when we see that it's hit the mark and god's going to answer your prayers personally great joy is manifested but you've got to go through the travail you've got to go through the season and what are we going to do and how we're going to get there it's going to be by making booze brothers if you could go to that on the slides i'd really appreciate that are the slides that we can go to right now so i thought i'd make some pictures of boo so that we'd all get to understand a booth it's like a thicket it's like a covert or a booth was a rude temporary shelter kind of like your body it's temporary you're gonna get a new body who's going to get a new body i mean right now you're going through travail and sorrow and dying all of us are dying say brother john how can i have the holy ghost or how can i have a born-again experience and feel so sad or weary or dreary we all are groaning we all are under travail but a booth it was a rude temporary shelter like a hedge with a fence around it like being shut in it was like let's make booze and let's get in there it was like a temporary shelter where you could kneel down where you could pray it wasn't for the public crowd a booth was something that you were to do yourself to prepare for the feast see everybody wants the feast they want the good times they want the revival but they're not willing to grab look at this fetch olive branches pine branches myrtle branches and palm branches branches of thick to make booze as it is written what is a booth it's something that is to block out it's to something overshadow and screen you to stop the approach to shut in to cover oneself it is a protector it's to cover or lay over let's while we sing that song we heard it tonight cover me cover me friends all of it was just leading up to this tonight that is for all of us not just the preachers or the prophet or the older ones it's for the young people find a place that you can run into and let off the pressure i got to stop right here you're all weird just get over it you're all oddballs all right everybody yes sir stop trying to act cool cool dudes go to hell the rich young ruler was cool he gave tithing he was good around he knew how to you know his mom and dad thought he was good the priest thought he was good oh he was a cool dude cool dudes go to hell there's some children in this service tonight that are the children of a father that when i preached that years ago when he was wayward and away from god he gave his heart to the lord and three of his children's in the service tonight cool dudes go to hell even in the message they can be cool have good fathers mothers grandparents say i'm just being cool you're going down the wrong road i'm gonna say it again tonight so that the children of the children can catch it we're not trying to be cool we're not trying to impress one another no none of the ministers this weekend are preaching to the preachers this is a young people's meeting we're here to capture the hearts of the youth stop trying being cool you're not going to make it in the rapture just being cool i think i missed the mark there i need to step back and say something different do you all remember the rich young ruler what happened to him he knew abraham he you know sent moses and somebody back tell my friends i miss the rapture tim's he got all evangelistical down in hell just somebody put some water on the tip of my tongue then he got really anointed okay let's give him five minutes tonight let's give the rich young ruler a temporary resurrection and bring him into bethel tabernacle youth camp and just talk to us for five minutes how many would like that tonight okay nobody does it we won't then okay let's move along i mean who would you the rich young ruler he he wouldn't just be standing behind this pulpit okay it's so nice to see you he he would be energized he would be like young people i gave my life i was in the church and i missed it don't do what i did don't go to that place he'd be shaking this place say brother john if i had someone rise from the dead i would believe so if i had brother branham rise from the dead and have tent meetings or if i had somebody else preaching tonight other than you i'd be listening no friends if someone rose from the dead and spoke to us tonight you say i'd be on the edge of my seat you wouldn't be on the edge of your seats no more than you are right now that's what jesus said no one rise from the dead they still wouldn't believe oh young people bethel tabernacle youth camp god awaken our senses we don't know if in five minutes somebody's gonna collapse in the service some of you remember a few years ago at louisiana camp there was a young man that was sitting about right here throughout the whole weekend of the meetings a wonderful young man and he you can go back in the videos and see him raising his hands and worshiping god and he he was on he was connected brother adams you remember this happened some years ago and he went through the whole weekend i think it was maybe tuesday night brother adams i'm not for sure he was involved in the singing of his church group there out in the midwest and he was tired from the meetings it was a long weekend they'd stayed up probably like many of you stayed up and you know they drove all the way home and now it's monday or tuesday night and they're having it wasn't choir practice it was like music practice he was tired and we're out and on his way home he fell asleep and crossed over and smashes into another and he's gone say brother john now you're bringing an emotion no that's reality it happens it happens to good people i was so happy brother matthew to be able to go back in the archives and see that young man say who was that young man he was right on the front row raising his hands of that praise god to even have ministry that come down to your level or have a desire and i'm just right in with brother burley williams i'm 49 years old and feel like i'm going over the hill we're doing all we can to connect with this generation i have if you can believe it i have grandchildren and two more on the way it's like lord i don't know what they're going through i don't know what they're facing other than being with them more and jumping down into the trenches and talking to you but god knows let's all say god knows god has heard your pain and saw that you would have it ten times more than brother matthew brother matthew has children with all of brother matthew watkins children please stand stand to the feet i don't want to embarrass you but i'm making you're saying wonderful tonight the lord used judah four children and with their father stan and sister rachel able to stand she may not be here but do you know now would brother matthew's father stand now brother jason his mother is streaming their service so right within this atmosphere and believe me there's more unseen that are in this building right now sister gene watkins brother jason watkins brother matthew watkins now four children are here is it four what is it we're seeing fulfillment of scripture that there would be generation and brother watkins and sister gene would pray and here's a minister of the gospel brother jason and she would have children and i know there's more than brother matthew i'm just making a point here and then there would be brother matthew and then he would have children that this promise is for you and to your children and there's groanings and there's pains and there's travail god bless you thank you very much how many would like to have a family that we're serving the lord when you have children and family about half of you manga i pray it'd be all of you amen you're serving the lord and bring revival in every generation let's go to the next slide let me tr here you go thank you brothers this is like a booth this is what a booth was it was something that was overshadowed and it was weaved together you got in there it was a place of prayer this is what it was in leviticus it was the feast of tabernacles there had to be booze everyone had to make their own booth this is speaking of the last pilgrim festival it lasted a week and this is where the booze were built during this time a season of rejoicing they're kind of crude looking they're kind of you know it's not fancy and here they they try to to worship and bring it up today this is just some visuals for you on the right is maybe a little bit more what they were trying to do in jerusalem and israel they're trying to keep a feast bring the branches let's it's not a huge massive place where you invite everybody it's a more of a private booth where there's let me just say it like this for us tonight a booth speaks of a place of consecration and a greater dedication where god could restore and bring back a spiritual life that is consecrated and fully surrendered to christ that's what i'm speaking about tonight young people i love when you clap i love when you worship i love to see you happy i love to see you respond but i'm not here for a momentary little injection or standing behind the pulpit tonight just for some glory of ourselves we're here friends that you as a person would understand that what you're going through the spiritual things and the contractions has been the holy spirit and he's inviting you into a booth not a public show this isn't for everybody to know this is for you to run into and say lord i love you with all of my heart and i worship you on monday i love you on tuesday we read it in the book of nehemiah that since the days of joshua they had not celebrated this 1 000 years listen really close a thousand years they had stopped making booths in the church in the young people they didn't know what it was to be consecrated they didn't know what it was to have a fully surrendered personal walk with god it had been neglected and i say tonight from 1965 to 2021 is 56 years since our prophet has left but i'm announcing to you there is a generation that god is restoring and bringing back their right minds that we must have a personal daily humble walk with god true worshipers worship god in a personal private booth in jeffersonville brother branham said god bless those who raise their hands they're desiring that lovely life of full consecrated sanctified filled with the holy spirit dedicated to god washed in the blood they long for it they're waiting okay i'm just going to put it in words for you you're longing for it you're waiting it's like we're a body but we're just kind of walking softly like brother branham would stand and say if you've noticed i've been speaking for a little while i'm just waiting i'm waiting for him to come it's not that all the other words were filler it's not that there wasn't something throughout the other part of the service but he had learned to wait then he would say he's here and he talked about a three-room house he said no matter how big of a house you live in we all live in a three-room house and the first is the kitchen then the parlor or the living room then the third room is the bedroom number one the kitchen is like the church it's where we all come together and we feed on the word it's so wonderful who likes to eat well that's wonderful to come to camp but i know some of you are going to want to get back home and eat there was a deacon that drove me to my motel he said man i'm glad i came with you today where are we going to eat a little something we went to a little place he's in my i wasn't really looking forward to the lunch there anyway we're at camp this is camp it's all right thank god for the camp food amen amen we all love church we love meetings like this it's just fantastic my you just feel like we're in heaven i i just feel like coming to these camps are like heaven to me hallelujah hallelujah just to look into your faces you're smiling tonight you're pulling you're hungry you're waiting this is wonderful it's fantastic but then he said you go to someone's house and eat food then you go into the second room that's like the living room or the parlor and it's like where you sit out in the lounge or you how you been doing how how's your school been doing how how how's your job all your get your driving and you talk to them a little bit more it's a little bit more personal you can open up a little bit more maybe you laugh a little bit maybe it's a little bit more serious maybe someone passes away as brother tim pruitt spoke in the service today to his his first grandchild being married sister adriana and spoke to brother ben and you know there's going to be things happen in your life that might bring sadness and separation in the good times of the bad do you realize the vow you're about ready to take is there's going to be good times there's going to be bad times you can talk to one another a little bit more intimately in the parlor but the third room is the bedroom it's the place where life comes from it's it's the place where men and a woman are together they don't invite the family and everyone in from the outside it's not like party time this is a private place this is a place where the husband this is where life comes from does everyone understand i ask you to be spiritual and i can see that you're really desiring to press yourself that third room tonight the angel of the lord is in the service the angel of the lord is talking intimately with you and maybe those next to you maybe a row back from you but god it's like the holy spirit i see him tonight standing at the bedroom saying would you come a little further i've seen how you've been in service and you've been respectful and you've been with your friends and later on we'll be at the campfire and then in your wow in your cabins for the last night and it's just maybe a smaller group but god i just see him standing over by this other room saying would you come i want you to come come into this place you say ah i don't know if i'm gonna yeah god's saying you're old enough i'm too little uh my parents are my no no you can't bring your friend and everybody into this room this is between you and god alone god move our young people into that place he said we're ma not by any other means he said but by the holy spirit and when they go out from here that i want everyone to just take this when they go out from here may they find out all those things that they once hung on to is gone may it be left behind dead and may they go out this morning humble sweet loving christians with faith believing may they live so consecrated to thee at the end of their life they would come to thee having this assurance that they've passed from death and to life and know christ and the power of his resurrection look at this tonight this is a booth this is a place where spiritual contractions are happen in your booth this is what we're talking about about the bride of christ it's time to bring forth it's contractions do i have a we've reached the end of that praise the lord so tonight the world is calling to you and god is calling to you who are you going to answer to can i speak now from my heart the world has its enchantments for all of you and there are things that turn you on and there it might not even trouble the brother next to you or the sister next there's enchantments and there's things that satan wants you to default back to you're not of this world you don't even fit in good let me just be honest over the last few years there's been people leave the message i've known a lot of them very personally and their children do you know what happens they end up worse than people in the world how many can testify you've seen that their hair grows pink green yellow they turn into homosexuals and lesbians and they're you know now they used to be speak against alcohol you shouldn't drink alcohol now they're just so happy to post they got their beer they're so free now we can all do whatever we want to do what you've always wanted to do they never responded to the spiritual contractions they didn't understand what birth pains was or they got embarrassed when you talked about it their face got all red they couldn't go all the way to pentecost they kind of stumbled around some of them were worship leaders some of them were dynamic pastors some of them were young people that could sing a special and give a testimony and some of you would say it like this they brought the house down and tonight they're worse than people in the world they've gone crazy times 10. and you always wonder if something is of god it should make you better it should make you grow more like the lord if they got a greater revelation they should be more like christ is that true talk to me tonight if somebody has a greater revelation it should show in their lives it should show in their patience that they should be able to put up with you if they've got a greater patience and a greater love if they have a greater revelation than the message they ought to live more holier come on everybody but just look at it they they go worse they go weird they go wild do you know what it is friends once god reveals himself to you and puts his seed into your life if you reject that if you say no it's souls in prison now they can hear the word they can be in an atmosphere and not even be moved god help us right now where's the groaning where's the interest for people to really cross the line and be birthed satan has been tempting you and will tempt you more but the holy spirit is for you and the cry of your heart and the travail the bible says in romans the whole earth is groaning and travailing for the manifestation of the sons of god where are you tonight and birth pains brother branham said it takes pain to bring forth a birth it takes a labor and a strain to break forth praise the lord i brought something tonight i need some volunteers i need three brothers and three sisters don't all come at once but for one of these i can't have somebody that's uh allergic to nuts i'm a nut so be careful me and me but one of you can't come up for this one demonstration if you've got an allergy to nuts okay so i need three sisters look there's only

like the taste of the lord tonight it's always good it is psalms 34 verse 8. the brothers were taking a little rest up there brother branham talked about this in shreveport he said there was a young fellow holding a debate and he said there's no such a thing as god this is an infidel saying there's no thing such a thing as god there's not such a thing as god and he kept going on like that and a little old silly looking boy sitting back there with hair hanging down in his eyes and an overall jacket on he come walking up one foot out in the front and stood up in front of the infidel and he just took an apple and started peeling an apple so i'm going to give this to a brother a brave brother thank you brothers please step right up here what's your name daniel let's all give daniel a round of applause nope we've got to stand right there buddy thank you and what's your name emma god bless you sister emma so this man started peeling this apple and this infidels got kind of upset you know this this young man he just you know his teeth was this way his coat this hair hanging down an overall jacket and he said what do you want he started talking kind of like this and this young man he said i just want to ask you a question he said well ask him he said well wait a minute he just started peeling his apple and cutting the core out he said just say it hurry up this infidel's so upset he said say what you're going to say or i'll have you throw it out this young man just said well wait a minute and he peeled the apple and took a piece and put it in his mouth now brother daniel that's a nice looking apple please hold it up can you please take a bite of that brother daniel sister emma is that apple sweet or is it sour um i feel like this is a trick question sweet i'm going to say sweet brother john don't give trick questions i wouldn't embarrass you like that in front of all these people just stand right over here a little bit okay sweet sweet you calling me sweet or him oh the apple okay brother daniel take another bite of that please now she can guess she can get embarrassed and say it's a trick question trick or treats tomorrow so we're at camp tomorrow thank the lord october 31st but brother daniel he tasted of this so he had personal experience he knows what that apple tastes like what did that taste like brother daniel it's more sour than sweet yeah but it's because it came from the motel they just get the cheaper ones brother i believe that but the only way you you believe that wow this is a believer brother but he tasted and he can tell us what it tasted like now sister emma can you taste that apple please it's not a trick question does anybody know what that is what kind of apple that is granny smith don't talk about her like that she's a nice person ooh sister i wasn't talking about you i was talking about grandma granny okay can you take another bite of that and just tell what do you think that granny smith tastes like brother daniel what do you think that apple tastes like i think that one's sour green apples are always out ah because you've had experience huh you're the apple man thank you you're welcome brother i have a brother daniel oh thank you yeah thank you so sister emma is really the only person in this room that really knows what that tastes like what did that taste like that tasted sweet no i believe you're 100 but he thought it would be sour because all granny smiths are sour right but not this one brother daniel i worked in produce too most granny smiths are sour little children that steal stuff at grocery stores they grab one of these so if you taste of something you don't really know what it's like unless you taste it is that right so now this infidel is like getting so upset like tell me this you know daniel and this brother emma she's just eating these apples and just tell me what it is or i'll have you throw it out well just wait a minute they kept eating took a piece put it in their mouth begin to chew it and swallowed it and finally this young man said i want to ask you a question is this apple sweet or sour now he's talking to the infidel that had just gotten insane there's no such a thing as god this message isn't true all this about the holy ghost is just drama and this young man took a bite of this apple and then he asked the the he said i want to ask you a question is this apple sweet or sour the infidel said i'm not eating it i don't know the infidel said i'm not eating it i don't know and the young man said that's what i thought and he walked right out of the room amen friends we don't need a lot of drama but once you taste of the lord and you see that it's real it doesn't matter what anybody says the infidel had never tasted of the lord he didn't hadn't experienced that peace or that joy thank you emma you can eat that if you want it you can take it brother daniel let's give him a round of applause god bless you thank you this is one service the one

you eat some of those my i could have some of those honey roasted ones right now and that'd be fantastic some of your mouths are watering right let's not have a bunch of people leave the building so what's it like it's crunchy crunchy is it sweet is it sweet it's salty she tasted of it she knows what about healing the only way you can be healed is if you've been sick who's been sick in this building and god's ever healed you you say i've tasted i can see thank god for the realities of spiritual contractions where we can say i know what you're talking about and may god meet the cry of your hearts taste and see that the lord is good blessed is the man that trusteth in him how many would like to trust in the lord tonight god bless you let's give them a round of applause so as we come now to the end of this part of the service on spiritual contractions and what the lord would have for us i pray that every single person that is sick would be healed by his stripes ye were healed it is finished means it was already in the past you just need to taste of it somebody that's bound tonight you need deliverance taste and see that the lord is good he's in the building tonight to deliver you if you've never been saved it's no under you lie and curse and swear and go to places you shouldn't you're just unsafe but when you really get saved something happens in you call upon the name of the lord and you shall be saved if anyone is desiring the holy spirit tonight i would just encourage you to receive it you don't have to struggle and fight just walk into that third room walk over there where the angel is just saying come on in here don't fight and struggle about it just receive ye the holy ghost i see a teenage young lady before we come into the prayer line i see a young lady that's been raised in the message also actually ministers daughter coming through a time of her teenage years she's struggling doesn't matter what your name is or where you live or who your pastor is satan will come in those demon spirits of depression i'm going somewhere with this and you talk about the groaning you talk about the travail you talk about on your bed you talk about when you're alone and you're talking about everyone else could be happy but there's still that spirit hanging over you and you're never good enough and you're always condemned and she goes through her teenage years and no matter how good the music was no matter how good the preaching was she was struggling in herself and through the awkward times of teenage years and she becomes so struggling with this she begin to cut herself another young lady that i'm thinking about was in high school too and she began to cut herself because those spirits are wanting to take your life and they're also wanting to bring attention there's a cry for help does anybody hear the cry for help and we can be right around people that are about ready to shatter and break apart and not even know it i want to stop right here and say god help all of us to be more sensitive there could be somebody at this camp that is just struggling even right now battling darkness and demons and devils and i hear the clanking of chains and this young lady was beginning to cut herself and in another situation i said we got to get her out of that situation we got to get her out of there and we got her into a church school and she was able to grow up in another environment and met her husband and tonight she has four wonderful boys and she loves this message can we thank god for bringing her out of that marry clay and satan would have loved for us to have another funeral service and another meeting like brother john had being raised in the branham tabernacle and the deacons son my best friend the deacon son and if i said his name most of you would know his last name the pastor's grandson i was his best friend being raised up and we'd go to his house and we'd have great times and we'd be together and as he came up into high school and he was on the student council he was popular and he had a truck and everything but one day and nobody knew but he just drove up into an isolated place and took his life and i'll never forget it brother jason standing in the graveside there in jeffersonville where brother branham is also buried and many other people and the mother here now we're about ready to bury this young man's body and the mother just wailing i never had a chance to say goodbye and there were school buses and school buses from his school he was so popular that came to the branham tabernacle i never had a chance to say goodbye satan took a life in a moment of depression and hardship i said god save our young people deliver them from the lie of the enemy i'm here tonight to push back against that darkness so this young lady she began to cut herself and and and satan had just brought her to such a deep depression and hardship and the awkwardness and time through her life but i thank god god dealt with that young lady's life and she had a most wonderful conversion god filled her with the holy ghost and she's been changed and one year after that she's in a meeting full of hundreds of other young people just packed out around march or april in louisiana and people are standing there praise and they're rejoicing they just want to praise the lord they want to worship the lord they just want to give god praise and glory like you have been this weekend and she saw other people praising and thanking god but because of her past and what she had gone through there were scars there were scars and you you all know in march and april there it can get humid and she just had on a shirt that was a short sleeve shirt she said i'd be so embarrassed brother jason i'd be so embarrassed to know that i had gone through that kind of thing i wouldn't want everybody to know i would be ashamed to know that i had gone so low being raised in the message that i wanted to take my life i don't want to tell nobody but i think sometimes we need to tell those around us so that others know we're not a bunch of angels in this building tonight we're sons and daughters of god that are groaning under travail i've got to find you where are you and she's sitting in the meeting she says lord i want to praise you i want to glorify your name she just passed the point where she said i don't care what other people think i'm going to stand and praise god anyhow i'm going to give god worship i'm going to give god praise and she stood up on her feet begin to worship the lord and thank the lord and when she sat down she looked at her arm and the scars were gone all the scars god's able to take the memory able to take the scar able to take the issue able to take your past god's in the delivering business god's in the saving business can the musicians all come wherever you're at can the musicians come how many believe what god did for others he can do for you how many believe what god did for some of your fathers and your mothers and people that are older god can do for you i don't think we need to be ashamed you older ones that we also struggled as youth and we don't have the time tonight to hear brother john's testimony but thank god one day the lights came on can any adults stand on your feet you that are 18 or older and say god's done a work in my life and i want to give praise to god brother yance don't leave brother travis any adults want to stand and say god's done a work in my life to god be praised there's nothing to be ashamed of we thank you lord how many of you that are standing can say what he did for me what he did for older ones he can do for the rest of these taste and see that the lord is good god bless you can have your seeds i wonder if that sister now that's married and has wonderful children that i just spoke about if she'd stand on her feet oh taste and see sister deb i don't think everyone saw you stand some didn't even know we thought you were always like this we thought that deb was always like this but god rich in mercy poured himself down into a life and older ones you don't need to be ashamed of your past you can say what god did for me he can do for anybody else i didn't think i would embarrass you sister deb but i know that when i heard this testimony and i know many of you have heard it and we took it around the world in the last few months literally and i let sister deb know this privately with my wife there every time we give this testimony brother jason every time in europe all through the states the whole congregation just burst out there's such a release there's such like a a praising god every place we've been i thought wow what god can do for a young lady what god can do for a young man and the ministers are going to come now we're going to gather behind this curtain and pray i think brother matthew's going to take this pulpit and then i believe the spiritual contractions that's been going on and the booths now that god has been preparing for all of us god is going to birth out into a wonderful victory in jesus name heavenly father as we stand to our feet tonight you've seen the pain and the struggle and the travail of soul body and spirit even the songs that we're saying tonight as we sang and move the service up a half hour early to give a little more time for this next part for healing and deliverance and laying on of hands lord you have the answer to every person's situation an issue i pray right now the angel of the lord would come to this address we put it into our gps and was able to drive here but i pray the angels of god that are assigned for this type of a meeting would now come very real among us and the angel of the lord and the ministering spirits and the spirit of christ would now envelop this sanctuary and go out across the internet and those that are streaming or wherever stream the service may there be testimonies of healing and miracles and great joy lies ahead for us this day this scripture is fulfilled it's not just sermons it's not just people gathering it is now the heart of god it is now the will of god for such a time as this lord
