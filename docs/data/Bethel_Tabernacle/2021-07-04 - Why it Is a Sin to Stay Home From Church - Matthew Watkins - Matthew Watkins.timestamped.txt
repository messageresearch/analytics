[1:46] return to the book of hebrews
[1:48] amen chapter 10 hebrews chapter 10.
[1:52] we're going to teach something here this
[1:53] morning and i'm going to
[1:56] take a title that is going to
[1:59] immediately get attention
[2:01] and so you might say brother matt did
[2:02] you title it that way to get people's
[2:04] attention
[2:05] yeah i did so if you think that that's
[2:08] why i did it i did it that way
[2:09] intentionally i'd
[2:10] stand behind it and we're going to teach
[2:12] why but sometimes you have to use
[2:15] um as brother branham talked about a
[2:17] fishing lure you use something to get
[2:19] someone's attention
[2:21] because you know you got something good
[2:22] to give them amen and we didn't come to
[2:26] firstly say to we didn't we don't teach
[2:28] on this to give you our opinion
[2:31] uh here today but just our reflections
[2:34] on what we see
[2:36] in the word of god hebrews chapter 10
[2:39] verse 25 i'd like to just teach on why
[2:43] it is a sin to stay home from church
[2:47] hebrews 10 verse 25 and brothers you can
[2:50] put the powerpoint up at any time you'd
[2:52] like to
[2:54] not forsaking very familiar scripture
[2:56] here
[2:57] not forsaking the assembling of
[3:00] ourselves
[3:02] together as the manner of some
[3:05] is so looks like not going to church is
[3:08] not a habit of 2021 post covid
[3:11] but it goes all the way back to biblical
[3:13] times
[3:14] where the writer has to say as some is
[3:17] the custom
[3:18] to forsake the assembly
[3:21] he says let's read it again not forsaken
[3:23] the assembling of ourselves
[3:26] together as the manner of some is
[3:29] but exhorting one another and so much
[3:33] the more as you see the day
[3:36] approaching you can have your seats this
[3:38] morning we're just gonna read some
[3:40] other scriptures and you don't have to
[3:42] put them on the screen so that you can
[3:44] save
[3:44] you can keep my powerpoint um i think i
[3:47] got the clicker here
[3:49] we will just want to hurry through this
[3:50] because we've got a lot to get to
[3:52] i'm going to do quite a bit of reading
[3:54] and i know this will go out online and
[3:56] they'll be able to see these some of
[3:57] these quotations just make sure
[3:59] there was our scripture so the bible
[4:02] speaks about now i'll firstly
[4:04] answer this question immediately and
[4:07] just
[4:07] ask the question myself can a christian
[4:12] forsake the assembling of gathering
[4:16] at church should they no they shouldn't
[4:19] can they well the bible tells us
[4:22] not asks not recommends not good advice
[4:26] but it's commanded actually
[4:29] and it's amazing you have to go back
[4:31] through some of these things some of
[4:32] these
[4:32] most basic beliefs of the christian
[4:36] church of what we believe
[4:38] and it's amazing how often you have to
[4:40] go back to some of the roots
[4:42] because we can tangle things up and get
[4:44] things so complicated
[4:46] um and and people can can can
[4:49] uh construe a idea it's not based on the
[4:53] bible at all so let's go back to the
[4:55] word of god that's what we want to do
[4:56] today
[4:58] is christian gathering at churches
[5:01] local buildings and assembling biblical
[5:04] or is it traditional is it just a church
[5:07] tradition that we have well
[5:09] hebrews 10 answers that very
[5:11] matter-of-factly
[5:13] as the bible says to not forsake the
[5:15] assembling
[5:17] of ourselves together as the manner of
[5:19] some
[5:20] is so what is sin it's unbelief
[5:24] is it a sin to not go to church it is a
[5:26] sin not to go to church
[5:28] now have i committed this sin brother
[5:30] matt if i'm if i don't make a church
[5:32] service is about attendance
[5:34] no that's not at all what we're saying
[5:36] not even closely resembling
[5:38] that it's not about a checklist we don't
[5:40] have a membership peers that can just
[5:42] become
[5:43] religiosity and idolatry really
[5:46] as people as churches nominal churches
[5:49] create a membership
[5:50] book an attendance book and they
[5:52] actually take your attendance like a
[5:54] roll call
[5:55] and we're not speaking about that at all
[5:57] this isn't a checklist this is
[5:59] something that you do out of the desire
[6:02] of a changed heart so when a person
[6:05] becomes a believer a christian and god
[6:07] does something in their heart
[6:09] they can't help as brother branham says
[6:11] but to come to the house of god
[6:13] can i miss will i miss church yeah
[6:15] there's many times i've not been here in
[6:17] attendance
[6:18] uh though those those circumstances have
[6:20] been extremely rare for myself and for
[6:22] some others in different
[6:24] uh places of life it's became uh there's
[6:28] many times that you maybe can't sit here
[6:30] at a seat
[6:31] or thankful in those cases for things
[6:33] like streaming
[6:34] but we're talking about the forsaking of
[6:36] assembling not coming to church
[6:39] for a reason and one that is uh not
[6:42] according to the word so let's just look
[6:43] at that today before we get
[6:45] tangled up in some of that so to answer
[6:47] the question flatly
[6:48] no a christian comes to church that's
[6:51] what a christian does that's what
[6:52] believers believe
[6:54] can they will is it is it a sin when
[6:56] you're not here sitting in the seat no
[6:58] it's not about that
[6:59] i'm speaking of a pattern or a habit a
[7:02] church habit where we forsaking
[7:04] that's a word that has an important
[7:06] meaning we're going to look at here in a
[7:07] minute
[7:08] but we're forsaking whether by excuse
[7:12] or by belief the assembling
[7:16] of ourselves together now obviously
[7:18] there's going to be times
[7:19] in the world where that's impossible
[7:21] there's some places in the world where
[7:24] they have a desire to gather but they
[7:27] can't
[7:28] whether by persecution or it's against
[7:30] the law
[7:31] we went through a time here as a
[7:34] pandemic where we had local government
[7:36] um putting down restrictions now while
[7:38] we wouldn't
[7:39] we wouldn't uh give in to local
[7:42] government telling us not to come to
[7:43] church we're going to gather regardless
[7:45] but there were reasons for that i don't
[7:46] want to go into the weeds there with
[7:48] that there were reasons
[7:49] during the spanish flu that you were it
[7:52] was
[7:52] it was out of the good of the love of
[7:54] your own neighbor to not
[7:55] gather and be around each other during
[7:57] that time but that's not what the
[7:59] bible's talking about when it says
[8:02] the custom of some is to forsake the
[8:04] assembling
[8:06] let's look at this word here the king
[8:08] james version is people let's
[8:10] go back there not forsaking the
[8:12] assembling
[8:13] well brother matt that's speaking of
[8:14] spiritual and as long as we're gathered
[8:17] in heavenly places in christ jesus well
[8:19] let's look at what it actually
[8:20] means the king james translates strong's
[8:23] g1 1996
[8:25] g-1997 if you want to look up the
[8:27] strong's
[8:28] coordinates on the word it's number 1997
[8:32] you could look that into any lexicon
[8:33] search and it translates it in the
[8:36] following manner that word assembling
[8:39] gathering together gathering
[8:43] together assembling
[8:47] together outline of biblical uses this
[8:50] is also from the lexicon
[8:52] it means a gathering together in one
[8:56] place
[8:57] gathering together in one
[9:01] place number two the religious
[9:04] assembly of christians
[9:08] this is strong's again new testament
[9:10] word 1997.
[9:12] it means a gathering together
[9:16] in one place
[9:19] physical means in every sense of the
[9:22] word a
[9:22] physical gathering
[9:26] and you say brother matt why is that
[9:27] important because if you go look up
[9:29] hebrews chapter 10
[9:32] it talks about provoking each other to
[9:35] love
[9:37] it talks about exhorting each other
[9:40] in the word of god what does the bible
[9:42] speak about in the new testament church
[9:44] when it says they continued
[9:46] daily in the apostles doctrine
[9:50] and in fellowship how many bible readers
[9:52] do we have here today
[9:53] you read that in the book of acts they
[9:55] continue daily in the apostles doctrine
[9:57] and
[9:58] fellowship and the breaking of bread
[10:01] so what do you have in assembling or
[10:04] gathering together in one physical place
[10:07] you have fellowship
[10:08] you have provoking each other to love
[10:10] you have encouragement
[10:12] how do you fulfill the scripture if
[10:14] you're streaming
[10:16] if your church is a streaming church and
[10:18] and you stream and that's
[10:20] all you do is stream how do we fulfill
[10:23] the scripture about the new testament
[10:25] church to fellowship
[10:27] one with another and break bread
[10:31] the bible speaks in another place and it
[10:33] says and
[10:34] jesus says uh wherefore i go to prepare
[10:36] a place and it says
[10:37] wherefore comfort each other
[10:40] with these words and i know we can do
[10:43] that by text and i know we could do that
[10:45] by phone call but i think the bible if
[10:47] we're coming back to the bible
[10:49] the bible's speaking of a physical
[10:51] gathering
[10:52] together now i got to put this asterisk
[10:55] in there because we have streaming
[10:56] audience i want to say to you today
[10:58] it's god's will for you to be in church
[11:00] now if you live somewhere there's no
[11:02] local place for you to go at all and to
[11:04] gather into a symbol
[11:06] then i pray that god gives you that
[11:09] place
[11:09] but i don't pray that you stay in that
[11:12] place
[11:14] we have families that have moved here
[11:15] from many miles away that didn't have a
[11:18] church home and stream for years because
[11:20] that's all they could do
[11:22] and thank god they had a desire in their
[11:23] heart to do that but that's not the
[11:25] ultimate will of god for you
[11:27] the will of god for you is to come here
[11:29] and gather i guarantee if you ask
[11:31] brother mark carter there in the back or
[11:33] any of the other brothers or families
[11:34] that moved here
[11:35] the difference in and years of going to
[11:38] church at home
[11:39] streaming versus being connected to a
[11:42] local body
[11:44] it's different and so we just say we
[11:46] appreciate the fact and we know
[11:48] some people are in certain circumstances
[11:50] say brother matt you're going to step on
[11:52] this toe well i'm not stepping on
[11:53] anybody's toe i'm just
[11:55] reading you the word of god amen let the
[11:58] word be our teacher this morning not for
[11:59] the mat being his opinion here
[12:01] or a pet peeve that's not what this is
[12:03] about we're just coming back to the word
[12:04] of god and i know most people have
[12:06] already clicked away and turned to me
[12:07] off anyway
[12:09] so we'll just say this for those archive
[12:11] for those watching by archive
[12:14] so it means a gathering together in
[12:17] one place let me just go back to this
[12:21] let's look at some of these things i
[12:22] love this so much and if brother nathan
[12:25] bryant
[12:26] pastor there uh i think in kentucky or
[12:28] indiana there
[12:29] he put together if he if he watches this
[12:32] he put together
[12:33] a wonderful study i could give you if
[12:36] you text me and
[12:37] and i'll give you the link to that he
[12:38] put together an article a document
[12:40] that's just
[12:42] uh it's very comprehensive very good
[12:45] well put together
[12:46] on scriptures and quotes and we're going
[12:48] to read from a lot of them today what
[12:49] brother brandon believed about
[12:51] going to church let's read some of these
[12:53] scriptures here luke chapter 4
[12:55] verse 16. if you have a bible go ahead
[12:57] and turn quickly
[12:58] if you could luke chapter 4 i want you
[13:01] to read this there brother mark maybe if
[13:02] it's quick you could put it up our
[13:04] brother brad
[13:04] if it's quick you could put it up i
[13:06] don't want to
[13:08] mess anything up with you there so if
[13:10] it's not don't worry about it but luke
[13:11] chapter 4
[13:13] verse 16. let's just read it together
[13:15] quickly and he came to nazareth
[13:18] where he had been brought up i know who
[13:21] we know who we're talking about here
[13:22] and as his custom
[13:26] was as his
[13:29] custom was so is this church tradition
[13:33] is this denominationalism is it the
[13:36] opinion of brother branham or the
[13:37] opinion of even the apostle paul no it
[13:39] was actually the opinion and not only
[13:40] opinion the custom
[13:42] of jesus to go to church so when i say i
[13:45] want to be like jesus i include this too
[13:48] he says as his custom was he went into
[13:51] the synagogue
[13:52] on the sabbath day and stood up for to
[13:54] read acts
[13:55] chapter 17 verse 1. we got to move
[13:58] faster
[13:59] acts chapter 17 verse 1 now when they
[14:02] had passed through
[14:03] now i'll give you just a minute to get
[14:05] to there
[14:07] uh verse 1 of chapter 17 of acts acts
[14:10] chapter
[14:12] 17. it says they came to thessalonica
[14:15] where was a synagogue of the jews
[14:18] and notice this verse 2 and paul
[14:21] as his manner was
[14:26] so what's hebrews 10 speaking of it's
[14:28] not about you missing
[14:30] a church service here because you were
[14:31] you had your ox was in the ditch
[14:34] and you couldn't come to church now i
[14:36] know what it means to have an
[14:37] ox in the ditch but i want you to think
[14:40] of that
[14:41] term the ox you're speaking about a
[14:43] farmer
[14:44] who's his purpose of having that ox is
[14:47] to for
[14:47] for for harvesting and for farming so
[14:50] that he could put
[14:51] food on the table listen friends your ox
[14:55] isn't in the ditch when you're using
[14:57] that job to buy
[14:58] the next 20 latest 2022 model vehicle
[15:02] that's not your ox in the ditch that's
[15:05] pharaoh's bricks getting dry that's what
[15:07] that is
[15:08] you say i gotta work brother matt mox is
[15:10] in the ditch really you drive brand new
[15:11] vehicles you have a brand new house
[15:13] and your ox is in the ditch i think what
[15:16] it's speaking of is a man who's trying
[15:18] everything to put food on his table and
[15:20] he's got to work he has no
[15:21] choice or he'll go hungry so let's just
[15:25] get these terms right my ox is in the
[15:26] ditch i've got a business i've got a job
[15:28] satan will give you as we said last
[15:30] wednesday every
[15:31] excuse to forsake the assembling
[15:35] in the house of god that was free it
[15:38] wasn't on my notes
[15:40] acts 17 notice and paul as his manner
[15:44] was
[15:44] went in unto them three sabbath days
[15:46] reason with them
[15:47] so his manner his custom this was a
[15:50] lifestyle it was part of what they
[15:52] did listen to what brother branham says
[15:56] here he says i don't have this on the
[15:57] screen he says i told them tonight
[15:59] usually this is surge we would see jesus
[16:00] in 61
[16:02] i told them tonight usually it's my
[16:04] custom to go to church somewhere on
[16:06] sunday if i possibly
[16:09] can brother branham did you believe
[16:13] that it was wrong or sinful wrong
[16:17] for a christian to stay home from church
[16:18] well let's find out what he said here i
[16:20] don't have that brothers if you you got
[16:22] to get that back up
[16:23] this isn't going to work too well
[16:31] that's all right just advance it you can
[16:32] just advance it no worries
[16:34] brother branham here you him 1960 it's
[16:37] wrong to stay home from church
[16:39] can you say amen to that i don't agree
[16:42] with that well then you're not a
[16:43] believer
[16:45] i don't i don't really i believe that
[16:47] was brother branham's opinion well then
[16:49] you
[16:49] you don't believe the message but i do
[16:52] listen to what brother adam says next
[16:53] slide here if you have that you can
[16:55] advance that brothers for me we would
[16:57] see jesus 1959
[16:59] if you loved god you'd be at church
[17:02] you've got to get back to the church
[17:04] back to the bible
[17:06] back to christ discerning the body of
[17:08] the lord we're going to go through these
[17:09] let's just read them
[17:10] a real born-again man or a woman that's
[17:13] got discernment of the holy ghost will
[17:16] find his place in church
[17:19] worshiping and crying out and doing all
[17:22] that's in his life to try to bring
[17:24] sinners certainly christ is the mystery
[17:26] of god revealed in 1963
[17:29] don't stay home thank you brother
[17:32] brandon i'm glad i didn't have to say
[17:34] that you did
[17:35] if god's in your heart you can hard you
[17:38] can't hardly wait for them doors to open
[17:40] out yonder
[17:42] to get in here to fellowship with your
[17:44] brothers
[17:45] if you don't don't feel that way then i
[17:48] tell you it's
[17:49] time you got to praying god hiding
[17:52] himself in simplicity 1963 a real mother
[17:56] wants to take her baby to church and
[17:58] that's the thing you should do the
[17:59] entombment 1957
[18:02] then how can you say you can stay home
[18:04] and be
[18:05] just as good a christian as you would be
[18:07] at church you
[18:09] can't do it amen
[18:12] you can't do it the position of a
[18:15] believer in christ 1955.
[18:17] now the fellow said i can be a christian
[18:19] and stay home just as well
[18:21] no you can't no you've got to meet
[18:25] a symbol gather together with the
[18:28] rest of the body he has blessed us
[18:30] together in heavenly places in christ
[18:33] jesus thirsting for life 1960.
[18:35] people say i can stay home be just as
[18:38] good a christian as i can at church you
[18:41] can't well you can't
[18:44] well but no you can't you can't your
[18:48] opinion doesn't matter
[18:49] i'm so glad we've got a vindicated
[18:51] prophet with
[18:52] with infallible vindication that we can
[18:55] stand upon today that i can say
[18:58] my opinion and your opinion
[19:01] don't matter don't matter you might have
[19:04] it you might love it you might exalt it
[19:06] and want anybody to hear it but it don't
[19:07] matter
[19:09] he says you can't the bible said not
[19:12] forsake
[19:13] our assemble ourselves together and that
[19:15] much more
[19:16] as we see the day approach and if you're
[19:18] a christian go to the next one if you're
[19:20] a christian you long to go where other
[19:22] christians are and fellowship with other
[19:25] christians so you cannot
[19:27] stay away from church and live the same
[19:30] life
[19:30] you can't do it because it's like i'm
[19:34] hungry but i'll never go to a table
[19:36] i just i'll never eat i just i ain't
[19:38] gonna do it see
[19:39] you've got to go and feed on the word of
[19:41] god and fellowship
[19:42] notice he didn't leave it with feeding
[19:44] on the word of god i can just stay home
[19:45] and stream brother man i'm getting the
[19:47] same thing no
[19:48] you're not let me say brother sister
[19:51] covet has given more people more excuses
[19:54] to
[19:54] disobey the bible than
[19:57] any other uh thing you want to point out
[20:00] or fear or thing that's happened in this
[20:02] world covet has given more people
[20:03] excuses to just
[20:05] be flat out disobedient
[20:08] to the bible the bible says go to church
[20:10] don't forsake it
[20:11] assemble you say when brother matt
[20:14] anytime the church doors are open
[20:17] he says you're going to do it you got to
[20:19] do it word and get the word of god and
[20:21] fellowship one with another we
[20:22] i love this we need one another
[20:26] more now than ever did need each other
[20:29] is now when you get yourself
[20:31] singled out from the rest of them making
[20:33] yourself
[20:34] just a little different you don't want
[20:36] to associate with them because they
[20:37] believe this and don't want to associate
[20:39] with that
[20:40] you're getting on dangerous ground right
[20:42] then keeping away from
[20:44] church find the one of your choice and
[20:47] remain
[20:48] there and be a christian brother to all
[20:50] of them
[20:51] brother man i don't come to church
[20:53] because i don't i'm not fed at church i
[20:55] i i
[20:56] it's not the choice of my it's not the
[20:57] church of my choice i just not fed
[20:59] anymore
[21:00] i'm going to calm down i'm going to say
[21:02] this very very calmly
[21:04] then find you a church where you can be
[21:08] fed but please don't stay here
[21:11] if you've lost confidence and can't get
[21:13] fed from the ministry at this church
[21:15] you're doing yourself
[21:16] the name of christ and this church a
[21:18] disservice and a harm
[21:21] and i would say go find you a church we
[21:24] love you we'll miss you but we want the
[21:26] best for you
[21:27] we want the best for your soul we love
[21:29] you so go find you a church where you
[21:30] can be fed but please don't
[21:32] stay here while i don't want to hurt
[21:35] anyone's feelings
[21:36] you won't we'll miss you but we want you
[21:38] to go where you can be fed
[21:40] go find the church of your choice
[21:42] whatever you do don't leave here
[21:44] and go sit at home and stream
[21:47] go find you a church then we've got to
[21:50] follow he says here that's the way to be
[21:52] a real christian
[21:53] then we've got fellowship protection
[21:55] people love you and pray for you what
[21:58] visions are listen to this
[21:59] we feel that every person is duty bound
[22:03] how do you feel brother branham well let
[22:04] me tell you how i feel we feel that
[22:06] every person is duty-bound to attend
[22:08] some
[22:09] church and belong to some church as a
[22:11] christian
[22:12] not that many people say oh i just stay
[22:14] home and read my bible i'm
[22:16] just as well off let me give you what
[22:18] believers say
[22:19] i ought to stay home and stream i'm just
[22:21] as well off
[22:22] no the bible said we shouldn't forsake
[22:26] to assemble
[22:27] ourselves together we've got
[22:30] to do that we've got to stand together
[22:33] all
[22:34] the churches possessing all things 1962
[22:37] our heavenly father thou has chosen that
[22:38] we should gather together it's the will
[22:41] of god
[22:42] that we should assemble ourselves
[22:45] together
[22:46] as we see the day approaching and that
[22:48] regularly
[22:50] lord to bring ourselves closer to you
[22:52] and closer to each other
[23:07] from you questions and answers 1964. now
[23:10] i know
[23:10] they put a pressure on you and want want
[23:13] you to join but you don't have to join
[23:15] but put them kids in sunday school
[23:18] somewhere
[23:20] and you go to church don't sit at home
[23:24] go fishing and hunting and things like
[23:26] that on sunday you say well
[23:28] i'm not a legalist well you better be in
[23:31] that manner for a while
[23:33] dishonoring the resurrection of christ
[23:35] you go to
[23:37] church somewhere well churches you know
[23:41] brother matt it's just different things
[23:42] and you know i
[23:43] you just don't know my story and well
[23:46] i'm just giving you what the bible says
[23:49] many will say lord lord lord many will
[23:51] have many different excuses
[23:53] but here's what we'll be judged by
[23:57] he says dishonor in the resurrection of
[23:59] christ you go to church somewhere i will
[24:00] restore 1954 a man that's born of the
[24:03] spirit of god next slide
[24:04] a man that's born i will restore next
[24:08] slide
[24:10] a man that's born of the spirit of god
[24:12] loves to go to church
[24:13] better than he loves to eat his dinner
[24:16] when he's hungry the spiritual man on
[24:19] the inside has got to be
[24:20] fed that means he loves it more than his
[24:22] job more than his business more than
[24:24] success
[24:26] he loves going to church and he will
[24:29] forsake
[24:31] anything if it takes him out of the
[24:33] house of god
[24:35] if that man isn't fed he will die
[24:38] forsaking all
[24:39] 1962 you who have fallen away
[24:42] stay home on wednesday nights you who
[24:46] have
[24:46] well i just come to church on sunday
[24:48] well let's see what the prophet of god
[24:50] said
[24:52] you who have fallen away stay home on
[24:55] wednesday nights
[24:56] and won't come over here to church
[24:58] watching television and other nights of
[25:00] church
[25:03] do you think brother branham didn't
[25:04] cover this he did thoroughly
[25:08] that's what people do now they stay home
[25:09] on wednesday and watch television they
[25:10] watch the preacher on television
[25:15] amen did my streaming audience say amen
[25:20] you really say if you if you have to
[25:21] come to church you have to force
[25:23] yourself to do it he says
[25:25] because you think it's a law you do it
[25:26] you ought to do it it's honorable to do
[25:29] it and if you don't love to do it
[25:30] there's something
[25:32] wrong there's a holy spirit that makes
[25:36] you
[25:36] love to serve god here you him 1960
[25:39] but when a christian will stay home from
[25:41] church to see some silly play like that
[25:43] there's something happen in that
[25:44] person's life
[25:45] the holy spirit went out somewhere
[25:47] you're not about the father's
[25:49] business but instead influenced 1963 but
[25:54] instead of that we say glory to god i
[25:56] don't feel like going tonight
[25:59] i believe well i believe i'll stay home
[26:00] and see this good telecast tonight it's
[26:02] prayer meeting but
[26:03] and he says a sleeping church a lady a
[26:06] sean
[26:07] rich oh my there we are
[26:13] does a christian go to church i think
[26:16] it's
[26:17] it's thoroughly established
[26:21] we could read you we could you get that
[26:23] article from me that was page i think
[26:25] four of 19 or 20 pages
[26:29] of quote after quote after quote i could
[26:31] give you scripture after scripture after
[26:32] scripture it's not church tradition
[26:35] and the world changes but god doesn't
[26:38] change
[26:39] amen if we're believers we assemble
[26:41] ourselves together
[26:43] on wednesday night
[26:46] on sunday morning
[26:49] whenever the doors are open we assemble
[26:52] ourselves
[26:54] together because that's what the bible
[26:56] says and that's what we believe we
[26:58] believe the bible
[27:00] and we live by the bible say brother
[27:02] matt you don't know my life listen
[27:03] friends i do i've been there i've
[27:06] watched the devil try to sell me an
[27:08] excuse of why i can't because of my
[27:10] business and i'm just trying to grow my
[27:11] business and i'm trying to
[27:13] i'm trying to do things so i can sow
[27:15] seeds into the kingdom of god if i ever
[27:17] make it you know i'll give back to the
[27:19] family of god and i'll give back to
[27:21] missions field and i'll give back to
[27:22] that
[27:23] that's if you that's if you are still a
[27:25] believer after the devil takes you
[27:27] through the rat race and through the
[27:28] ringers
[27:29] because he'll take you down that little
[27:31] road and i've seen people walk that
[27:33] road of i'm just trying to get my
[27:35] business successful so that
[27:36] i can do something for the kingdom of
[27:38] god and it's funny all they did was
[27:40] build their own kingdom
[27:42] and they're nowhere today they're not at
[27:44] this church or any church or any other
[27:45] church
[27:47] they're taken captive by the devil we
[27:50] don't want to see that
[27:51] amen we say that to you with sincerity
[27:54] in our hearts
[27:55] we want you to be fed we want you to be
[27:58] full we want you to be spiritually
[28:00] healthy and you can't be if you stay
[28:02] home on wednesday nights
[28:06] brother matt sunday mornings oh yeah
[28:08] sunday mornings but we don't seem to
[28:09] have a problem with that here we have a
[28:10] problem with people staying home on
[28:12] wednesday nights
[28:13] it's amazing you watch how many times
[28:15] brother branham covers this subject and
[28:17] over and over again he says people
[28:19] you'd stay home on a wednesday night
[28:21] very rarely says
[28:23] it was i love susie or i love lucy that
[28:25] came on not on sundays but on wednesdays
[28:27] and it is amazing now that our church
[28:30] attendance and our levels when we see
[28:32] the day approaching
[28:33] as the bible says assemble yourselves
[28:35] that much more
[28:37] as you see the day approaching yet
[28:39] somehow we've got a pattern in the
[28:40] tradition
[28:41] in our churches where it's the opposite
[28:43] of that
[28:44] prior coveted we assembled more postcode
[28:47] now that we see that day approaching
[28:49] more and more we're
[28:50] more dis uh we're more disconnected and
[28:53] separated but you got to have unity you
[28:57] got to have fellowship you've got to
[28:59] have breaking and bread you've got to
[29:00] provoke each other in love you've got to
[29:02] be part of the body
[29:03] well the bodies hurt me well that's
[29:04] god's will that you're part of the body
[29:07] satan's will is to single you out get
[29:09] you away get you on some filling or some
[29:12] hurt feeling and keep you segregated or
[29:15] separated from the rest of the body
[29:17] brother adam said it's like a little a
[29:19] lie he says a predator gets his prey
[29:20] that way
[29:21] singles them out gets them away from the
[29:23] rest of the body
[29:24] you ever watch an animal a predator
[29:27] attack
[29:27] a prey what does he do he singles them
[29:30] out
[29:31] and satan singles people out tries to
[29:34] take them out as brother adam said that
[29:36] he said he got eve away from the word of
[29:38] god got her out of the fortification
[29:40] of the word of the body and he said he
[29:43] singled her out got her from outside of
[29:44] the headship of the word what do you
[29:46] think the devil's
[29:47] trying to do so much to get you so busy
[29:50] and so
[29:51] weighed down and so burdened down to
[29:54] disconnect you from the thing that gives
[29:56] you life
[29:58] disconnect you from the thing that gives
[30:00] you health
[30:02] makes you anemic amen and we
[30:05] you know it's amazing sometimes we look
[30:07] around and we we look at our life and
[30:09] say how is
[30:10] how did i get to where i'm at from
[30:11] yesterday to the day how did my life
[30:13] ever get here so much in
[30:14] shambles you know what what i've learned
[30:16] to do is just go back to the word of god
[30:19] and say lord where did i take the wrong
[30:21] turn
[30:23] where did i go wrong let me go back to
[30:25] your word
[30:26] because i know if i line my life up with
[30:28] the word i've got promises and
[30:30] benefits that come with that word let's
[30:33] stand to our feet
[30:34] lord jesus we thank you for your word
[30:37] this morning
[30:38] for all those lord that heard it i pray
[30:41] god that it wouldn't
[30:42] provoke them to hurt feelings or
[30:46] to be upset that's what the devil would
[30:48] love
[30:49] lord but i pray that it would provoke
[30:50] them something inside the
[30:52] something in their heart when they read
[30:54] the word when they hear what the prophet
[30:56] of god
[30:57] had to say it challenges them in their
[31:00] heart and
[31:00] makes them look introspectively and say
[31:03] where is
[31:05] where is my life what what what type of
[31:07] am i even a believer am i a christian am
[31:09] i even in the faith
[31:11] if i don't have the very basic
[31:15] basic custom that jesus had
[31:20] and that was to come to church whenever
[31:22] the doors were open help us lord help
[31:24] our assembly we live in a dark deceptive
[31:26] age and a deceptive time
[31:28] may your word pierce through all the
[31:30] darkness and may it contact that seed
[31:33] this morning
[31:34] bless this service we ask the remaining
[31:36] of it lord in jesus name
[31:38] amen amen god bless you
[32:16] you
