[7:19] Amen. I was just enjoying that um
[7:24] Sunday school lesson. You know, he
[7:27] talked about a testament.
[7:29] Some people put signatures and things on
[7:32] contracts.
[7:34] This contract is null and void until the
[7:36] Holy Spirit comes
[7:38] and is in your life. That born again
[7:41] experience. Then there's nothing can
[7:44] break it. Amen. Let's pray. Father, we
[7:47] love you this morning. And Lord, when I
[7:51] look at that testament, that New
[7:53] Testament that you brought forth,
[7:54] Father,
[7:56] oh, how I want it signed, sealed,
[7:58] delivered. Lord, I'm thank you for the
[8:01] sealing of thy Holy Spirit. And I pray
[8:04] for these people this morning, Lord.
[8:07] Those that are streaming, those that are
[8:08] sick.
[8:10] Father, I pray that you touch and bless
[8:12] each and every one. Lord, love you this
[8:15] morning. Enjoy your presence. There's
[8:17] nothing like coming to the house of God
[8:19] and worship you in spirit and in truth.
[8:21] I thank you for that, Father. As we
[8:24] collect the tithes and offerings, I pray
[8:25] that you bless the cheerful giver,
[8:27] magnify it to your kingdom, Lord. We are
[8:31] grateful for the bounty that you've
[8:32] given to us, Father. How you watch over
[8:34] us and keep us. I thank you for that in
[8:36] Jesus name. Amen.

[21:00] You are not a god created
[21:04] by human hands. You are not a god
[21:09] depending
[21:11] on any mortal man. You are not a God in
[21:16] need of anything we can give by your
[21:22] plan. That's just the way it is.
[21:29] Cuz you are God alone
[21:32] from before time began. I know that you

[22:04] none can contend.
[22:06] You're the only God whose name and
[22:10] praise will never end. You're the only
[22:14] God who's worthy
[22:17] of everything we can give. You are God
[22:22] and that's just the way it is.
[22:27] Oh, you are God alone.
[22:31] from before time began.
[22:35] You are on your throne.
[22:38] You are God alone
[22:42] right now.
[22:45] In the good times and bad.
[22:48] You are on your throne. Oh, you are God
[22:53] alone.
[22:56] You're unchangeable,
[22:59] Lord. You're unshakeable.
[23:03] You're unstoppable.
[23:06] That's what you are.
[23:09] You're unchangeable.
[23:13] You're unshakeable.
[23:16] You're unstoppable.
[23:19] That's who you are.
[23:23] You are God
[23:26] from before time began.
[23:30] You are on your throne. Oh, you are God
[23:34] alone.
[23:37] And right now
[23:39] in the good times and bad
[23:43] you are on your throne. Oh, you are God
[23:48] alone.
[23:51] Unchangeable,
[23:55] unshakeable,
[23:56] [Music]
[23:58] unstoppable.
[24:01] That's what you are.
[24:05] Unchangeable,
[24:08] Lord. You're unshakeable.
[24:12] You're unstoppable.
[24:15] That's who you are.

[24:30] alone.
[24:32] And right now
[24:35] in the good times and bad,

[25:29] us a song also, brother. Amen.
[25:41] God bless you.
[25:43] Appreciated that special.
[25:46] Need to get more of our
[25:50] young people and old people and
[25:51] middle-aged people up here to sing.
[25:58] I ask sister Deb and brother Aaron to
[26:00] help me on this.
[26:03] [Music]
[26:18] No eloquent
[26:20] prophecy or fancy miracle for all to
[26:24] see. Just the words
[26:28] go down seven times.
[26:31] [Music]
[26:32] So, as Non made his way into the Jordan
[26:38] River that day, I can't help but think
[26:42] what was on his mind.
[26:47] Well, as he slowly reached the water's
[26:50] edge, it rushes in over his head. He
[26:55] looks to see if the curse has washed
[26:59] away.
[27:02] Oh, does
[27:05] he
[27:07] say
[27:09] I keep going down and getting back up,
[27:14] but I see no change. I feel no touch
[27:18] from you,
[27:20] Lord, where could you be?
[27:25] This water's dirty and it's cold, but
[27:29] there's healing in it. So I'm told a
[27:33] miracle,
[27:35] but I've yet to see.
[27:39] But I'm staying here until you're
[27:43] through. Until I get a hold of you. I'm
[27:48] going to keep believing. But until then,
[27:53] I'm going to go down again.
[28:02] Well, I know what I feel deep inside.
[28:06] I've heard your voice a thousand times,
[28:10] but now
[28:12] it seems so long ago.
[28:17] Oh, but deep inside I still believe that
[28:21] somewhere you're listening.
[28:25] But I would like a sign so I could know.
[28:31] Oh, surely there's hope left yet. Lord,
[28:36] you wouldn't just forget. I'm fighting
[28:40] on my knees to get to you.
[28:45] So this is what I'm going to do.
[28:53] I'll keep going down and getting back up
[28:57] till I see a change or feel a touch from
[29:01] you.
[29:03] I know you're hearing me.
[29:08] This place is lonely and it's cold, but
[29:12] it's holy ground. So I'm told the secret
[29:17] place where you will meet with me.
[29:22] So I'm staying here until you're
[29:26] through. Until I get a hold of you. I'm
[29:30] going to keep believing. But I do it.
[29:36] I'm going to go down again.
[29:41] [Music]
[29:45] again.
[29:50] Well, I'll keep going down and getting
[29:54] back up till I see a change or feel a
[29:58] touch from you. Cuz I know you're
[30:02] hearing me.
[30:06] Oh, this place is lonely and is cold,
[30:10] but it's holy ground. So I'm told the
[30:14] secret place where you will meet with
[30:17] me.
[30:20] So I'm staying here until you're through
[30:25] until I get a hold of you. I'm going to
[30:30] keep believing
[30:33] until
[30:34] Oh, I'm going to stay here until you're
[30:39] through. Until I get a hold of you, I'm
[30:44] going to keep believing
[30:48] it. I'm going to go down again.
[30:56] I'm going to go down again.
[31:03] [Music]
[31:06] Our
[31:09] [Applause]
[31:47] Brother Jason text me this song while I
[31:49] was in Idaho
[31:50] and uh asked me if I learn it. I said,
[31:52] "Yeah." And then, um, I've been here for
[31:55] one service, and so I haven't had a
[31:58] chance to run through it with any of the
[32:00] band or anything, and honestly, it's not
[32:03] really committed to memory very well.
[32:04] So, pray for me. I'm going to try to
[32:07] sing it here.
[32:22] Sorry.
[32:31] [Music]
[32:40] When I'm feeling lonesome, there's no
[32:44] one else. And I walk through this world
[32:47] all alone.
[32:50] I open my Bible and get by myself.
[32:56] And I read my letter from home.
[33:02] I can still hear my mother.
[33:07] The same sacred page.
[33:11] Sick and lonesome. She spoke loud each
[33:15] word
[33:17] as she longed for the end of the age.
[33:21] And she asked
[33:24] and let's start over.
[33:25] Let's start over. Man, I'm sorry,
[33:28] brother Jason.
[33:30] I had it better than that at home. You
[33:31] did it good at home.
[33:35] [Music]
[33:43] When I'm feeling lonesome and there's no
[33:46] one else and I walk through this world
[33:49] all alone,
[33:52] I open my Bible
[33:55] and I get by myself
[33:59] and I read my letter from home.
[34:05] I can still hear my mother reading aloud
[34:09] from the same sacred page.
[34:12] letters from homeick and lonesome. She
[34:16] spoke loud each word as she longed for
[34:20] the end of the age.
[34:23] And she asked which way to
[34:29] homesick and ready to start.
[34:34] The pathway to home can't be seen or
[34:38] heard.
[34:40] But she knew the way by heart.
[34:45] [Music]
[34:56] When I'm feeling alone and there's no
[35:00] one else and I walk through this world
[35:03] all alone,
[35:06] I open my Bible
[35:08] and get by myself.
[35:11] [Music]
[35:12] Then I read my letter from home.
[35:16] Letter from home. The words of my father
[35:21] bringing me peace in the dark troubled
[35:25] days.
[35:26] Letter from home.
[35:28] Sick and lonesome. I speak loud each
[35:31] word and they comfort me page after
[35:35] page.
[35:37] And I ask which way to
[35:42] I'm homesick and ready to start.
[35:47] But the pathway to home can't be seen or
[35:51] heard.
[35:53] It can only be felt by the heart.
[35:59] [Music]
[36:09] When I'm feeling lonesome and there's no
[36:13] one else and I walk through this world
[36:16] all alone,
[36:19] I open my Bible and get by myself
[36:25] [Music]
[36:27] and I read my letter from home.
[36:33] [Applause]
[36:40] Amen. Let us stand to sing. Because he
[36:43] lives as brother Jason comes.
[36:50] Because
[36:52] he lives.
[36:58] I can face
[37:00] tomorrow.
[37:03] [Music]
[37:05] because
[37:08] he lives.
[37:12] All fear
[37:15] is gone
[37:20] because
[37:22] I know
[37:24] [Laughter]
[37:27] he holds my future.
[37:35] And life is worth the living
[37:41] just because
[37:44] he lives.
[37:46] Give the Lord a wave offering
[37:49] because
[37:51] he lives.
[37:56] I can face
[37:58] tomorrow
[38:03] because
[38:06] he lives.
[38:10] All fear is gone
[38:18] because
[38:20] I know
[38:21] [Music]
[38:25] he holds my future.
[38:32] My life is worth the living
[38:40] because
[38:41] he lives
[38:46] and because
[38:48] he lives.
[38:53] I can face
[38:56] tomorrow
[39:01] because
[39:03] he lives.
[39:08] All fear is
[39:15] because I know
[39:20] [Music]
[39:22] he holds my
[39:34] living
[39:37] Because
[39:38] he lives
[39:47] [Applause]
[39:50] because he lives.
[39:51] Amen.
[39:52] Amen. Everything becomes possible
[39:55] because he lives. That's the good news
[39:56] of the gospel. He lives. God bless you
[39:59] today. You can be seated momentarily,
[40:01] man. We're happy to have you in the
[40:03] house of God this morning. And um I want
[40:06] to be praying for a couple of families
[40:08] who are away still traveling and u uh we
[40:11] know the whole Demar tribe is up in
[40:15] taking a little bit of RNR time. I saw a
[40:17] picture of brother JD fishing. Looked
[40:19] like he was catching them too. So that
[40:20] makes it worth it. Amen. And other
[40:23] different ones are traveling. And we've
[40:25] got a couple of prayer requests we're
[40:26] going to take up here just in a moment.
[40:29] Um want to remind uh myself and uh
[40:33] brother Luther if you will not let me
[40:34] forget we have a baptismal at the end of
[40:37] service today. And uh so a young brother
[40:40] come to me uh before I left for Poland
[40:42] and felt it on his heart. Had been
[40:44] baptized before but wanted to be
[40:47] baptized again. I did the same thing. I
[40:49] did that I might have even did it a
[40:51] third time. I don't remember but I think
[40:53] I only did it twice best I can remember.
[40:56] Amen. Sister mom might correct that, but
[40:58] I think it was twice. Amen. And uh so
[41:01] we're going to have that and we don't
[41:02] want to forget that. Uh a couple of
[41:04] prayer requests. So, as you all know,
[41:07] you probably woke to the the news of the
[41:10] ratcheted up tensions now that are going
[41:12] on around the world. I'm not here for
[41:14] political take a political position. Um
[41:18] we already know that they can't fix it.
[41:21] We already know that it can only get
[41:22] worse and worse no matter what they do
[41:24] or do not do. So, brother Brandon made
[41:27] it clear there will be no peace Jesus
[41:30] comes. And I just say, even so, come
[41:32] quickly.
[41:35] Lord Jesus, come quickly. But we want to
[41:38] be in uh prayer today for believers
[41:40] around the world facing uh the rising
[41:43] global tensions and dangers. We don't
[41:46] know, friends. We know there there are
[41:48] certain backs stops that we know we
[41:49] won't see when uh we know the the pale
[41:52] horse rider cannot begin his full
[41:55] complete ride uh until the bride is
[41:58] gone. You're a hindrance to him taking
[42:01] full authority because authority is
[42:03] still in the bride.
[42:05] Amen. And she's the final voice to the
[42:07] final age. So yeah, the you know the
[42:10] Pentagon, the White House, the Kremlin,
[42:12] the Vatican, they can say what they
[42:14] want, but the bride is the final voice
[42:17] to the final age. And so we realize that
[42:20] God has it all perfectly in his plan.
[42:23] It's hitting on all cylinders, and
[42:25] there's nothing late
[42:27] here to tell you the rapture is not
[42:28] late. Now, we feel like it might be
[42:30] overdue, but the Lord has always known
[42:33] the exact time when the dead in Christ
[42:35] will rise. We which are alive and remain
[42:39] shall be changed. I'm looking forward to
[42:40] that.
[42:42] Amen. So we we brother Brandham gave us
[42:45] one particular thing that when you can't
[42:49] buy nor sell except you have that mark.
[42:51] Prophet makes it clear we're already
[42:53] gone. You don't see that. That's part of
[42:54] the full power of the beast system. We
[42:57] don't like to talk about the fact that
[43:00] the beast system has its headquarters
[43:02] here in America,
[43:03] but it does.
[43:05] It's the same power that used to be in
[43:08] in the old Roman Empire and was in
[43:11] Europe and but now it the beast rose up
[43:14] out of the land not out of the sea uh
[43:17] like he did there in Europe. He rose up
[43:19] out of the land spoke like a lamb at
[43:21] first but then later speaks like a
[43:23] dragon and exercises all the power that
[43:26] the first beast had. So, these things
[43:29] are um sure and steadfast and and we I'm
[43:34] glad that we know what's up. I'm glad I
[43:36] understand what's going on. I we don't
[43:39] have to suffer the men's hearts failing
[43:41] for fear and the fears that are coming
[43:43] upon the world. There's no worse anxiety
[43:46] than the fear of the unknown. So, I'm
[43:49] glad the Lord has revealed these things
[43:51] to us.
[43:52] Sister Phyllis will be headed out today
[43:54] to be with her sister Susie who's having
[43:58] a serious surgery procedure to uh ward
[44:02] off a possible cancerous u growth. And
[44:05] so she's going to come up for a prayer
[44:07] cloth. Uh don't let me forget that as
[44:09] well. We want to pray over that at the
[44:11] end and send that with her as she goes.
[44:14] Brother Ken wrote me this morning
[44:15] fighting off a lying devil attacking his
[44:17] upper respiratory system. other
[44:20] different ones. I know uh some members
[44:22] of my family have been a little bit
[44:23] under the weather, but um we're just
[44:26] trusting the Lord. Brother Caleb is
[44:27] ministering away today at brother Daniel
[44:30] Gizendon Danners, and he made mention
[44:31] that Joy and the kids are uh under that
[44:34] same attack. So my my goodness, the
[44:37] devil's still a liar.
[44:39] Amen. Praise the Lord. Happy to have
[44:42] these fine young men here with us today.
[44:44] And man, so you were singing, you were
[44:46] playing guitar. Yeah. So, you're hired.
[44:49] Amen. Now, there there's no pay and
[44:52] little little gratitude, but Amen.
[44:54] Praise the Lord. Amen. You did get to uh
[44:57] play and sing with the best band in the
[44:59] message today. So, we're happy uh for
[45:03] that. Amen. And all the other different
[45:05] ones, Mike and Sister Wanda. Glad to see
[45:07] you guys back safe and sound. Amen.
[45:11] Praise the Lord. We're going to have you
[45:13] stand to your feet and we'll read our
[45:15] text and then we will take up some
[45:18] prayer requests. Uh we want to uh be
[45:21] praying for brother Kenny and um I'm
[45:23] going to pray uh for the believers
[45:26] around the world because listen, there
[45:28] are there are believers in Israel
[45:32] and one out of 10 missiles is getting
[45:34] through and uh there are there are
[45:36] believers in Iran. There are believers
[45:38] throughout the Middle East. And so we
[45:41] want to be in prayer for uh God to watch
[45:43] over his family. There's believers in
[45:45] Ukraine. There's believers in Russia.
[45:47] Amen. And uh and you know, we don't
[45:50] know. You know, they're talking about
[45:52] retaliation to this country. But I'm
[45:54] just glad I can say I'm a believer
[45:56] and I'm under under the the guidance of
[45:59] the Holy Spirit. This is an hour,
[46:01] friends, when you're going to want to
[46:03] make sure that you're under the guidance
[46:05] of the Holy Spirit. I pray that every
[46:08] day. Lord, keep me completely under your
[46:10] leadership at all times. Amen. Praise
[46:14] the Lord.
[46:15] Hebrews chapter 7. We'll have that put
[46:18] up on the screen. You can turn to it in
[46:20] your Bibles also. Hebrews chapter 7.
[46:24] And um
[46:32] so um we're only getting these first
[46:36] three verses.
[46:38] Um
[46:40] maybe I sent something different to the
[46:42] booth, but um yeah, Hebrews 7 1-3.
[46:47] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[46:53] This is the
[46:55] um opening text that brother Brandham
[46:58] took in the message. Who is this MelzDC?
[47:01] I'm continuing today. This I think
[47:04] should be the second installment in
[47:06] future events made clear in prophecy.
[47:10] And um I want to talk about what God is
[47:12] doing today. And I'm going to take for a
[47:15] subtitle redemption unfolding. Now when
[47:17] we talk about future events, it's
[47:20] important that you understand that you
[47:23] have past events and future events. And
[47:26] the included in the future events are
[47:29] the right now events.
[47:30] Amen.
[47:31] They're happening today. You say, "Well,
[47:33] then you know if they're why do you call
[47:35] them in the future?" Because what you're
[47:37] going to hear today, you should be
[47:39] beyond tomorrow.
[47:42] Amen. This is a constant growing. You're
[47:44] going to see that today as as God has
[47:47] unfolded himself. Who is this? Melzdc
[47:50] was one of the most profound sermons
[47:52] brother Brandham ever brought. And uh
[47:54] it's it was a running understanding to
[47:57] him in his ministry progressively
[48:00] throughout his ministry. And fact is
[48:02] that's why he doesn't even come to it
[48:03] till the last um year last uh sermons
[48:08] last year of his of his ministry. He's
[48:10] going to come in the first part of 1965
[48:13] and preach this message. He had preached
[48:15] on Melzdc priest and king but it nowhere
[48:18] near began to touch what was occurring
[48:21] in the day and hour of our of our age.
[48:24] And brother Brandham was left astonished
[48:26] at it himself. And it's been a
[48:28] astonishing to me all over again as I've
[48:31] been looking at it very closely. Hebrews
[48:34] 7 verse 1.
[48:37] For this Melzdc, king of Salem, priest
[48:40] of the most high God, who met Abraham,
[48:44] returning from the slaughter of the
[48:46] kings, and blessed him, to whom also
[48:49] Abraham gave a tenth part of all, first
[48:53] being by interpretation
[48:55] king of righteousness, and after that
[48:58] also king of Salem, which is king of
[49:01] peace, without father, without mother,
[49:05] without dissent, having neither
[49:07] beginning of days nor end of life, but
[49:10] made like unto the Son of God, abideth a
[49:13] priest continually.
[49:16] Amen. Let's pray.
[49:19] Master, we thank you for your word now
[49:21] that's been read across the pullpit.
[49:23] Lord, there's a blessing in reading it.
[49:25] There's a blessing in hearing it read.
[49:28] So, we already know that a blessing is
[49:30] underway. But now we're asking and
[49:33] appealing to you, the only one who can
[49:35] open the word to us. May it be open to
[49:38] our hearts and minds. And Lord, as you
[49:40] know, the burden of my heart. We're not
[49:42] here just to look at at high altitude,
[49:46] Lord, edge of the atmosphere realities
[49:48] and truths and teachings. But we want to
[49:51] know, Father, what's the reality? What's
[49:53] the ramification to us? How should it be
[49:56] affecting our lives? Lord, that's the
[49:59] real burden of my heart today. So that
[50:02] we can look in the word and see what you
[50:05] have done. So that we can understand
[50:07] what you are doing. We can see you
[50:10] throughout the scripture. So we can
[50:12] identify you clearly in this time. We
[50:14] can see how you moved in your family
[50:17] throughout the pages of the Bible. That
[50:19] should inform our thinking, Lord, as to
[50:21] how we should be responding to the
[50:23] things going on around us. These things
[50:26] were not unknown of you. The tension,
[50:28] the trouble that's in the world. You
[50:30] knew it was coming. You said it. You
[50:32] even Lord, in your earthly ministry, you
[50:35] knew these kinds of days would come. You
[50:37] knew that the gospel would not stop it
[50:39] from coming. There would come a day on
[50:41] the earth of tribulation the the likes
[50:44] of which the world has never seen. and
[50:46] you sent them forth with the gospel, not
[50:48] to prevent that, but to but to lay away,
[50:52] Lord, to fill up the role of all of
[50:55] those names that were on the lamb's book
[50:56] of life before the foundation of the
[50:58] world, to find your family, Lord, and to
[51:01] extract her before that that coming of
[51:04] the great and dreadful day of the Lord.
[51:06] Now, Master, we're here today uh tension
[51:10] throughout the world. Your believers are
[51:12] scattered across the world because that
[51:14] you promised that would happen when this
[51:16] gospel, that gospel of the son of man,
[51:19] that gospel of the word made flesh. When
[51:21] that gospel had gone into all the earth,
[51:25] then the end would come. And we know
[51:27] that this ministry now of the word made
[51:30] flesh, the ministry of the son of man is
[51:32] in your bride. It's around the earth.
[51:34] And Lord, now is the time of thy coming.
[51:36] It's already underway. We know we're
[51:38] already in process. the world falling
[51:41] apart. No way to stop it. But Lord, may
[51:44] you help now and keep your hand of mercy
[51:46] upon your family. See to their need, see
[51:49] to their safety. Lord, we commit
[51:51] ourselves into you. The one that we can
[51:53] trust completely. Father, we're
[51:57] remembering those who are sick among us.
[51:59] Couldn't be here today because of it.
[52:00] Some of them, some traveling away. We're
[52:03] praying for them, Master. Now, for the
[52:06] balance of this service, may your great
[52:08] blessing be upon it. your August
[52:09] presence felt by all. We commit it to
[52:12] you in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you
[52:15] friends. You can be seated.
[52:31] Amen. I'm just going to go today and
[52:33] take my time, but we're not going to be
[52:35] long because I it's so much more than we
[52:38] can possibly cover. And I've got a
[52:39] certain section laid out to cover.
[52:43] And um we want to we want to cover it as
[52:46] best we can with keeping time in mind.
[52:49] We've got a baptismal service afterward
[52:51] and some different things to attend to.
[52:53] But Amen. This is the most important
[52:54] part, friends. And now I want to
[52:57] re-emphasize to you today and this is I
[53:01] I almost could underscore it and hang
[53:04] neon blinking lights on it. That's how
[53:06] important it is to me. I want you to
[53:08] realize that we're not just trying to
[53:11] look at, you know, edge of the
[53:13] atmosphere teaching. We're God's not
[53:16] here to entertain us. We're not here to
[53:18] wow people with theology or
[53:20] understanding. That's not really what
[53:22] it's about. Uh but what I what I'm
[53:25] hoping today and I want you to have this
[53:27] not in the back of your mind but in the
[53:29] front of your mind that what I'm trying
[53:32] to get across to us today by showing
[53:35] what brother Brandham brought to us in
[53:37] this profound message uh showing the
[53:40] ramifications of what it means to us
[53:44] right now. If we can see how he was then
[53:47] we can see how he should be now. Do you
[53:50] agree?
[53:51] Do you agree?
[53:52] Do you agree? Amen.
[53:53] So if Jesus Christ is the same
[53:55] yesterday, today, and forever, don't
[53:57] ever lose the value of that. That's why
[54:01] that scripture in Hebrews 13 was a
[54:04] theme. It was a central theme. It was a
[54:07] main theme of William Brandham's
[54:09] ministry even before the seals. He put
[54:11] that on his tent. You can see old
[54:13] pictures of his tent revivals. Hebrews
[54:16] 13:8. Because what he was proving is
[54:19] that the same Jesus that was 2,000 years
[54:21] ago not only is alive because the whole
[54:24] Christian world believes he he raised.
[54:26] So it's not unusual to say he's alive
[54:28] today. The every every Christian
[54:31] denomination worth it salt would go
[54:32] amen. But brother Brandham was actually
[54:35] showing more than just he's alive. He's
[54:38] here among us.
[54:39] And the the the signs that you're seeing
[54:41] and the miracles that are taking place,
[54:44] no human can do. It's an evidence that
[54:47] he's keeping his word and we've reached
[54:48] the end time.
[54:49] Amen.
[54:50] Amen.
[54:51] See, so especially as it related to the
[54:55] discerning of the secrets of the human
[54:57] heart, which no man could do, brother
[54:59] Brandham would say that constantly, you
[55:01] know, people would say, people out in
[55:04] the audience and and and and they asked
[55:06] him that question, brother Brandham, you
[55:08] know, around the breakfast table that
[55:09] morning and you know, does it work out
[55:11] in public? And he said, "Oh," he said,
[55:13] "you know what you see on the platform
[55:15] is about a tenth of it. It goes out
[55:17] across the audience. It's on the
[55:19] streets." And he turns around. He says,
[55:20] "All right, now look, just watch." And
[55:22] he, a young man walks in. He says, "All
[55:24] right, there's a young man off the
[55:25] street." And brother Brandham sit there
[55:27] and went down that young man's entire
[55:29] life. He's very troubled because his
[55:30] mother's very sick and he's he's here
[55:32] and he works here and uh but and he's
[55:35] under a great burden and and something
[55:37] to do with the disease of his mom. And
[55:39] when they brought the man over to the
[55:40] table, they asked him about it. And that
[55:42] man nearly couldn't believe it. How do
[55:44] you know me? How do you know about my
[55:45] mother? And so, so, Brother Brandham
[55:48] would would show how that that that it's
[55:50] not here as a circus. It's not here to
[55:53] entertain us. It's here to inform our
[55:55] thinking. If I'm seeing this, then what
[55:58] must day must I be living in? I must be
[56:01] at the end time. And then if I believe
[56:04] that, then how should I be conducting
[56:06] myself? And what should be my attitude?
[56:08] What should be my aims? What should be
[56:10] my goals
[56:12] on a daily basis?
[56:14] What should I think about church? What
[56:16] should I think about gathering? What
[56:18] should what should be my opinions about
[56:20] the preaching or the reading my Bible or
[56:22] listening to tapes or fellowshipping the
[56:24] saints? I'm here to tell you something,
[56:25] friends. It It's the message goes forth
[56:29] not to fill you up with knowledge. It's
[56:31] to change your life.
[56:34] Amen.
[56:35] It's to it's to guide you. And so, you
[56:39] know, we are guided by what we believe.
[56:41] All right? So, you know, you're probably
[56:43] familiar. I've told it a number of times
[56:46] over the years when I when I when I had
[56:49] a conversation with, you know, our our
[56:52] leading megaurch pastor concerning the
[56:54] identity of MelzDC and he he said, you
[56:57] know, he was just a man. He was just a
[57:00] just a king of Salem. He was a man who
[57:02] lived and died. and your your your
[57:04] profit so-called is making more to do
[57:07] out of it than it needs to be. And I I
[57:09] just went back to brother Brandham's
[57:12] simple simple term that's about as
[57:14] simple as you could make it. And brother
[57:16] Brandham, they were arguing over who the
[57:18] who mealed was in brother Brandham's
[57:21] day. And brother Brandham just come to
[57:22] this third verse and said, well, he has
[57:25] no father. He had no mother. He had no
[57:28] descent. He had neither beginning of
[57:30] days or ending of life. Whoever he is,
[57:33] he's still alive.
[57:34] Amen.
[57:35] So say what you want, but he never died.
[57:38] He never started.
[57:40] Said, "Yeah, but it's but but he's he's
[57:42] likened to the son of God." Yes.
[57:44] Exactly. Now you're starting to be a
[57:46] believer. But you you you you realize
[57:48] that that doesn't mean, you know, that
[57:50] he's something similar to it because the
[57:53] only way he could have no father or no
[57:55] mother is he would have to be God in a
[57:58] human form that looked like the son of
[58:00] the son of God.
[58:02] Amen.
[58:03] Why is that so difficult? Because it it
[58:06] flies in the face of their trinity
[58:08] teaching
[58:09] that he's three persons, which is such
[58:12] heresy and has always been. Yes. Amen.
[58:14] The early church fathers clearly did not
[58:17] believe that when they asked Ireneius,
[58:19] it's in his in his early and and even
[58:22] Tertullan in his early writings and and
[58:24] all of them uh in their early days. But
[58:26] Ireneius very clearly he called you know
[58:29] when they asked him how do you explain
[58:31] the son and the holy ghost and he says
[58:33] it's just the left and right hand of the
[58:35] one God. It's just God operating. It's
[58:38] still God. See, so the earliest church
[58:41] fathers that we have never considered
[58:44] God as three separate persons in any
[58:47] that's that was just um you know uh and
[58:50] even modalism tried to carry it on and
[58:53] they considered modalism heresy and
[58:55] modalism was more true than than
[58:58] trinitarianism but it still wasn't
[59:01] perfectly because it was based really
[59:03] just on Greek metaphysics. it was it was
[59:07] uh their their best way to try to
[59:08] explain it using Greek understanding. It
[59:11] still misses the mark and you end up
[59:14] with a oneness teaching. So So it it it
[59:17] I mean I'm I'm just glad it it took a
[59:19] prophet in the early church, St. Paul,
[59:21] and it took a prophet at the end of the
[59:23] ages to restore it back and give us a
[59:26] clear understanding. And when we
[59:27] understood it, we found ourselves.
[59:30] Amen. And that is the mind-blowing part
[59:33] that brother Brandham was trying to get
[59:34] across. Really, that's really the theme
[59:39] of who is this Melzdc?
[59:42] Because for brother Brandham to preach
[59:44] about the oneness of God was not new.
[59:48] For him to identify Melzdc as Almighty
[59:50] God was not new. But when he comes in
[59:53] February of 65,
[59:56] what he's trying to get across to the
[59:58] bride is that I've got to cover Melchzdc
[1:00:03] again so that you understand how in fact
[1:00:07] he was God. So that then you will
[1:00:09] understand that that the whole system is
[1:00:15] to is to identify that he's got an
[1:00:18] entire family. He's got an entire
[1:00:21] kingdom and it's all a continuation of
[1:00:24] God.
[1:00:25] So, so whether it didn't matter whether
[1:00:28] it was m whether Abraham met a a king of
[1:00:31] Salem or Joshua met a a captain of the
[1:00:34] Lord's host or Israel followed a pillar
[1:00:37] of fire by night and a cloud by day or
[1:00:39] Moses saw the back part of a man or
[1:00:41] Gideon saw an angel. Didn't matter what
[1:00:44] form it was. or when Jesus walked the
[1:00:46] shores of Galilee, it was God in morphe,
[1:00:50] God ch moving to a new manifestation.
[1:00:54] So then that then that brother Brandham
[1:00:57] is actually bringing this message. Who
[1:00:59] is this mazedc to show that in that
[1:01:03] unfolding he unfolds his family.
[1:01:06] Amen.
[1:01:07] Amen.
[1:01:08] Because he's the head, she's the body.
[1:01:10] See? All right. Getting a wee bit ahead
[1:01:12] of myself, but let's carry on.
[1:01:16] So, brother Brandon makes this
[1:01:17] statement. And who is this Melzdc? And I
[1:01:20] intentionally avoided a PowerPoint today
[1:01:22] because I I thought it might even
[1:01:24] distract me. So, let me just read. I
[1:01:27] don't have a tremendous amount of
[1:01:28] quotes. We got a lot of scriptures we're
[1:01:30] going to look at, but not too many
[1:01:31] quotes. I'd recommend you go listen to
[1:01:33] the sermon
[1:01:36] from 1965,
[1:01:37] February the 21st, in an evening
[1:01:39] service. Brother Brandham takes this
[1:01:41] sermon, who is this mazdc? And he says
[1:01:44] here, think of this great person of how
[1:01:47] great this man must be. And now the
[1:01:50] question is, who is this man?
[1:01:52] Theologians has had different ideas. But
[1:01:55] since the opening of the seven seals,
[1:01:57] the mysterious book that's been
[1:01:59] mysterious to us, according to
[1:02:01] Revelation 101:7, all the mysteries
[1:02:04] that's wrote in this book that's been
[1:02:07] hid down through the age of the
[1:02:09] reformers is supposed to be brought out
[1:02:12] into view by the angel of the last
[1:02:15] church age. How many knows that's right?
[1:02:18] That's right. Supposed to be brought.
[1:02:20] all the mysteries of the mysterious book
[1:02:23] is to be revealed to the Leodestian
[1:02:26] messenger of that age. So, brother
[1:02:29] Brandham's sermon then who is this
[1:02:31] Melzdc? I and I I don't know that I
[1:02:35] would have said this, you know, a month
[1:02:37] ago, but as I begin to study it, I I I
[1:02:40] think that it is perhaps one of the if
[1:02:43] not the most profound sermon in all of
[1:02:46] his ministry. And it literally took him
[1:02:49] 33 years to solidify it in his own mind.
[1:02:53] See, so now I'm I'm saying that to
[1:02:55] emphasize how how huge this is.
[1:02:58] It literally took a prophet 33 years of
[1:03:01] ministry to to solidify it and get it
[1:03:03] all. And he comes to the last year of
[1:03:06] his life. And so so you know, taking
[1:03:09] that long, it it it gets delivered near
[1:03:12] the end of his ministry. And it nails
[1:03:14] down really nails down among others, you
[1:03:17] know, uh it it really my I you know my
[1:03:21] my mind just goes to so many different
[1:03:23] sermons and I'm going to get
[1:03:24] sidetracked. I want to try to stay very
[1:03:26] focused. But but we know that that
[1:03:29] brother Brandham talks about, you know,
[1:03:31] it is the rising of the sun. Brother
[1:03:33] Brandham talks about Christ is the
[1:03:35] mystery of God revealed and there there
[1:03:38] and and you know God's only provided
[1:03:41] place of worship. There's sermon after
[1:03:43] sermon after sermon we could talk about
[1:03:46] but few if any bring out other than
[1:03:50] maybe until you get to the future home
[1:03:53] few if any of the sermons so encapsulate
[1:03:58] the the purpose of understanding.
[1:04:01] Why did Paul write about this man? For
[1:04:04] this Melzdc, king of Salem. And he he
[1:04:06] goes on to whom Abraham gave a tenth uh
[1:04:09] tenth part. So that's why when we when
[1:04:12] people pay their tithe, they're not
[1:04:13] paying it to a church or to a a
[1:04:15] preacher. Uh they're paying it back to
[1:04:17] God. They're they're returning God's
[1:04:19] portion to him. Let me tell you
[1:04:21] something, friends. I heard a wonderful
[1:04:23] statement brother Eugene made one time,
[1:04:24] and this isn't in my notes. This is
[1:04:25] free. But brother Eugene said, you know,
[1:04:28] God always overpays you.
[1:04:32] First of all, he supply he gives you
[1:04:34] everything. Everything you have,
[1:04:36] everything is his.
[1:04:38] See, even to the breath in your lungs.
[1:04:41] And he actually overpays you to see if
[1:04:44] you'll be faithful with his overpaying
[1:04:46] portion and give it back to him.
[1:04:49] See, he's waiting to see if you'll
[1:04:50] return it. If you're if you understand
[1:04:52] who Abraham was and who Melzdc was,
[1:04:55] paying tithes is not a problem for you.
[1:04:58] See, so but people who with a
[1:05:00] denominational idea, they miss it every
[1:05:02] time. And so it's not about you
[1:05:05] enriching God. God doesn't need any of
[1:05:07] your money, but it's it's about being
[1:05:10] loyal and saying, "I'm I'm not going to
[1:05:14] keep God's portion." Because the Bible
[1:05:17] says you're a thief if you do that. So
[1:05:20] all you're doing is you're not giving
[1:05:21] him anything. You're just returning his
[1:05:23] portion back to him. Amen. Why in the
[1:05:26] world? Lord goodness gracious.
[1:05:29] I have no idea why I said that. All
[1:05:32] right.
[1:05:34] Okay.
[1:05:35] Thank you. Please let me get back to my
[1:05:37] thought.
[1:05:39] All right. You Oh, if you try to be a
[1:05:42] preacher sometime, you don't even
[1:05:44] understand what you why you say the
[1:05:46] things you say.
[1:05:48] So, so it's going to nail down his
[1:05:51] identity as the only God and the creator
[1:05:56] of all things. I think because I I
[1:05:58] reread the verse and it triggered it in
[1:05:59] my mind is why I think that happened.
[1:06:02] So, it was word driven.
[1:06:05] Amen. Praise the Lord. You can just uh
[1:06:07] just say it was word driven. Wasn't me.
[1:06:09] Amen. Praise the Lord. I knew I had an
[1:06:12] answer somewhere.
[1:06:14] Uh so so when we when we see imagery,
[1:06:20] Bible imagery
[1:06:22] of God,
[1:06:24] then then that enables us as long as you
[1:06:27] know what you're looking for.
[1:06:28] Yeah.
[1:06:29] Then you can say, "Oh, I can track him
[1:06:32] through the Bible." Yeah, great.
[1:06:35] Fantastic. You're so smart because now
[1:06:38] you can go, "Oh, yeah. Melzdc was a
[1:06:41] type. You know, the pillar of fire was a
[1:06:45] type. The captain of the Lord's host was
[1:06:47] a type. You know, this one, that one,
[1:06:49] and this one, and that appearing, and
[1:06:50] this appearing, and that appearing. Uh,
[1:06:52] and and it was a type. But what but what
[1:06:54] it enables you to track is his nature,
[1:06:59] his reliable nature.
[1:07:02] And that's really what you should be
[1:07:03] focusing on. Not that I've got some
[1:07:06] super intelligence in scripture. I know
[1:07:09] more than the apologist and I can
[1:07:11] identify God because it wasn't a
[1:07:13] similitude of God. And that's one of the
[1:07:15] most amazing things that these were
[1:07:18] these were not a similitude of God. They
[1:07:22] were not just a representative uh person
[1:07:24] of God. It was actually an encounter.
[1:07:28] Amen.
[1:07:29] With God.
[1:07:30] I mean, get your mind around that. That
[1:07:32] almost makes the message that came with
[1:07:34] it pale by comparison. God's family down
[1:07:38] through history of the Bible, all
[1:07:40] through the pages have had interactions
[1:07:44] with God.
[1:07:47] Almighty God.
[1:07:50] So, so the the the notion that he's some
[1:07:52] far off uninterested, uncaring, nothing
[1:07:57] could possibly be more opposite of the
[1:08:00] truth than that.
[1:08:02] Amen.
[1:08:02] Nothing could be further from the truth
[1:08:04] than that. He's always from Genesis
[1:08:07] through Revelation. So from our past to
[1:08:10] our future, he's constantly appearing
[1:08:14] and unfolding and showing himself.
[1:08:16] You're not here alone, friends. I'm here
[1:08:19] to tell you, you're not here to try to
[1:08:20] figure it out. There's a being that
[1:08:22] you're having an encounter with.
[1:08:26] Say, "How do I always know it's him?"
[1:08:28] Because he has such a reliable nature.
[1:08:30] Amen. And every time he he unfolds a
[1:08:34] mystery of himself, it's always it's
[1:08:37] always consistent with the nature he's
[1:08:39] already he's already shown. So he
[1:08:41] repeatedly appeared through the Bible
[1:08:43] history in various times at various
[1:08:45] places. You find out that that God has a
[1:08:50] way of adapting his manifestation
[1:08:53] according to the redemptive purpose that
[1:08:55] he has in each age. Now,
[1:08:57] let let me try to explain that a little
[1:08:59] bit if I can without getting without
[1:09:01] getting too bogged down. But he, you
[1:09:04] know, when we talk about the Holy Ghost
[1:09:08] in the ages, this is just an example.
[1:09:11] So, we talk about the Holy Ghost in the
[1:09:13] ages and we say, well, it looks like
[1:09:17] that Luther probably didn't have the
[1:09:19] Holy Ghost because the he he would have
[1:09:23] never continued drinking beer and
[1:09:25] smoking a pipe.
[1:09:28] And it looks for sure like Wesley
[1:09:30] probably never had the actually the b
[1:09:32] the born again experience because he
[1:09:35] believed a doctrine of devils and
[1:09:38] preached it to his dying day. the
[1:09:40] Trinity.
[1:09:41] See, but but you but you come to find
[1:09:44] and understand the principle that you
[1:09:47] that sin is unbelief.
[1:09:49] Amen.
[1:09:50] And you can't unbelief what you don't
[1:09:52] know.
[1:09:53] That's right.
[1:09:54] So because because that wasn't made
[1:09:57] known to them. So then Christ is sitting
[1:10:00] in the eternities interceding on behalf
[1:10:03] of their ignorance. Amen.
[1:10:06] See, just like in the Old Testament when
[1:10:09] he gave them a substitute of the blood
[1:10:12] of bulls and goats and God kept
[1:10:14] deferring judgment of the world because
[1:10:16] he he knew, you know, the until John all
[1:10:20] through the Old Testament, the kingdom
[1:10:22] of heaven had suffered violence and the
[1:10:24] violent take it by force. Nobody had the
[1:10:26] a nature change. They they had a law and
[1:10:29] they had to constantly, you know, put it
[1:10:31] between their eyes and strap it to their
[1:10:33] bed and keep it meditate on it day and
[1:10:35] night. They still would stumble. David
[1:10:37] would still do things wrong. Moses would
[1:10:39] still do things wrong. And but yet and
[1:10:42] the and the whole world was overspread
[1:10:44] with idolatry. But God kept deferring
[1:10:47] judgment even upon his people.
[1:10:49] Yes. Amen. And he allowed them to not go
[1:10:52] into hell but to be in the lower parts
[1:10:54] in a paradise
[1:10:55] because they died in faith believing
[1:10:59] that like Job someday a redeemer is
[1:11:01] going to come
[1:11:03] and he's going to fix all this. So God
[1:11:04] just kept pouring it over because God
[1:11:07] was looking forward to someday the lamb
[1:11:09] of God will come and then I can empty
[1:11:11] paradise and bring them home to me.
[1:11:13] Where they began I can bring them back
[1:11:16] too. Amen.
[1:11:19] So, so you wouldn't say Luther didn't
[1:11:23] have the Holy Ghost. Brother Ram said,
[1:11:24] "Don't say he didn't have it."
[1:11:26] He did. But then you realize that the
[1:11:29] manifestation
[1:11:31] of the token on display
[1:11:34] is limited. I dare use that word. It's
[1:11:37] tamount to It's equal to the level of
[1:11:41] the revelation that's given.
[1:11:44] See? And so once Christ came and then
[1:11:49] the day of Pentecost happened and then
[1:11:52] they come to Peter, devout men already,
[1:11:54] they weren't drunkards. They just had
[1:11:56] the wrong thinking. They had a wrong
[1:11:58] understanding of who Christ was. And
[1:12:01] Peter said, "You killed him. You did it
[1:12:03] with cruel hands, wicked hands."
[1:12:05] However, I know it was misinterpreted
[1:12:07] theology. That's why you did it. You You
[1:12:09] did it by determinate counsel of your
[1:12:11] preachers. They told you to do it. You
[1:12:12] believed it. You It was a tradition. You
[1:12:14] did it. But oh my oh no, we've killed
[1:12:16] the Messiah. Hold on. Breathe. Take Hang
[1:12:18] on. David, don't forget David said he
[1:12:22] won't leave his soul in hell. And and
[1:12:24] and that same Jesus whom you crucified,
[1:12:26] God hath raised him up according to the
[1:12:28] promise and he's now both Lord and
[1:12:30] Christ.
[1:12:31] Amen.
[1:12:31] And when they heard this now, they said,
[1:12:33] "Okay, so maybe the end isn't yet for
[1:12:36] us. What must we do?" And Peter said,
[1:12:38] "You must repent.
[1:12:40] You've got to repent. You've got to
[1:12:42] change your thinking because your
[1:12:43] thinking will inform your lifestyle.
[1:12:45] Amen.
[1:12:46] And your lifestyle will either be
[1:12:47] pleasing or not pleasing to God
[1:12:49] depending on the age that you live in.
[1:12:52] See, so I heard brother Frank Prader
[1:12:55] give such a wonderful example I'd never
[1:12:57] heard before. And he talked about how
[1:13:00] that
[1:13:01] he emotion to a father who was in his
[1:13:04] sitting in the audience who had a
[1:13:06] two-year-old boy on his lap. I have no
[1:13:09] idea who the man was. I heard the name,
[1:13:10] but I didn't recognize it. And he also
[1:13:12] had teenagers working in the booth.
[1:13:16] And brother Frank said, "Now, you know,"
[1:13:19] he said, "Can you imagine what it would
[1:13:22] look like if one of those teenagers
[1:13:25] tried to come down here and sit on
[1:13:27] daddy's lap like the little
[1:13:29] two-year-old,
[1:13:30] right?"
[1:13:31] He said, "You would say, "That's not
[1:13:32] very mature." And you'd be right.
[1:13:35] But see, the two-year-old, you say, "Oh,
[1:13:37] well, he's just a little two-year-old."
[1:13:39] Hold on. It's more than that. The
[1:13:41] 2-year-old is perfectly mature for the
[1:13:45] dispensation he's in.
[1:13:49] You get it?
[1:13:50] So for the dispens, he's only two. So
[1:13:53] you wouldn't look at him, you wouldn't
[1:13:54] look at Luther and say, "Oh, he was must
[1:13:56] not have been born again." He was
[1:13:57] perfectly born again for the
[1:13:59] dispensation he was in.
[1:14:00] Amen.
[1:14:01] See? So you can see now why it is it is
[1:14:05] so shameful for you and I having come to
[1:14:08] the last age of full maturity and we're
[1:14:11] still trying to conduct ourselves in
[1:14:13] immature ways patterning after the
[1:14:15] entertainments and rudiments and things
[1:14:17] of the world and we don't have any
[1:14:19] spirituality and and I would say you say
[1:14:21] you're you're telling me I'm not a
[1:14:22] Christian. I'm not going to say that.
[1:14:23] That's up to God. But I will say you're
[1:14:26] not living mature according to the age
[1:14:28] that you're living in.
[1:14:30] You're in the dispensation of the full
[1:14:33] word becoming flesh.
[1:14:35] And I just say friends, we need to
[1:14:36] humble ourselves more to that than ever
[1:14:38] before. And we need to surrender our
[1:14:40] lives and say, I want to be level to the
[1:14:44] maturity that this age calls for.
[1:14:47] Amen.
[1:14:49] Thought it was an outstanding analogy.
[1:14:53] So, so now
[1:14:56] we see that God has been unfolding his
[1:14:59] nature as God and as he appeared and he
[1:15:03] reappeared among humanity and and and
[1:15:06] and once once we see that then we can
[1:15:10] begin to understand a little bit of the
[1:15:13] detail in the thought of who Mrs. Jesus
[1:15:17] Amen. Christ is
[1:15:20] the reason, one of the reasons that
[1:15:23] Jesus Christ
[1:15:25] was so obviously
[1:15:29] of God was he said, "Oh, well, he walked
[1:15:32] on water. He fed 5,000. He all it wasn't
[1:15:35] that. It was that his nature fit the
[1:15:38] word. He was uh he was obviously uh the
[1:15:42] same kind of a man continuing uh uh that
[1:15:45] that Abraham met that Moses met that
[1:15:48] Joshua met that Gideon met that all of
[1:15:50] them met and every time that's why John
[1:15:53] came out of the wilderness like he did
[1:15:55] and the Bible calls him the greatest of
[1:15:57] all the Old Testament prophets.
[1:15:59] Amen.
[1:16:00] So it becomes
[1:16:03] uh boundary pushing for sure
[1:16:06] because now you're beginning to equate
[1:16:11] Mrs. Jesus Christ
[1:16:14] in the identity of Mr. Jesus Christ.
[1:16:17] And you're you're not you're not saying
[1:16:20] that they're that they're co-equal. He's
[1:16:23] still my Lord.
[1:16:25] Amen.
[1:16:25] I still worship him, not the other way
[1:16:28] around. and I sure don't worship you.
[1:16:31] And you don't worship me.
[1:16:33] I didn't die for you. You didn't die for
[1:16:34] me.
[1:16:35] And so, as you've heard me teach before,
[1:16:37] when brother Brandon would say, "She is
[1:16:39] him," he's not meaning literally she's
[1:16:40] him. Because if she's him, who's him?
[1:16:43] So, but but Hebrews 13:8 again gives us
[1:16:46] the key. She's the same as him. Amen.
[1:16:49] And that's how we know who the bride is
[1:16:52] among 33,000
[1:16:54] different denominational ideas of who
[1:16:57] the bride is. That all there can't be
[1:17:00] 33,000 different versions of the bride
[1:17:04] anymore than there can be 33 different
[1:17:06] thousand different versions of the
[1:17:07] gospel. There's one version of the
[1:17:10] gospel, one version of Christ, one
[1:17:12] version of Mrs. Jesus Christ.
[1:17:15] And she has the same nature as the word.
[1:17:22] See, so it shows that then that God once
[1:17:25] you begin to see and I think this is
[1:17:27] what brother Brandham is really trying
[1:17:29] to point out is that once you begin to
[1:17:31] understand God unfolded himself that way
[1:17:33] and he took a lot of time at the
[1:17:36] beginning of the sermon
[1:17:38] and his purpose is not to teach you on
[1:17:40] the Godhead. his his whole beginning and
[1:17:43] opening foundation is so that you've got
[1:17:46] your brain in the right place. Got all
[1:17:49] your marbles in the right place uh for
[1:17:52] when he makes the jump and says, "Now
[1:17:54] let's flip it and let's look at Mrs.
[1:17:57] Jesus Christ."
[1:17:58] Amen.
[1:17:59] She's got the same nature. See? And so
[1:18:02] so that that a lot of times was what
[1:18:04] really, you know, um astonished the the
[1:18:07] theological world because it shows that
[1:18:10] God
[1:18:12] it certainly shows among many things
[1:18:16] that God had a future plan that went
[1:18:19] beyond Calvary.
[1:18:20] Amen.
[1:18:21] Amen.
[1:18:22] Amen.
[1:18:22] If it shows anything, it shows that that
[1:18:25] he had a future plan beyond Calvary.
[1:18:29] that Calvary say, "Well, it's it's it's
[1:18:31] the cross plus nothing." Okay, I agree
[1:18:34] with that statement. It's it's it's the
[1:18:37] Calvary. It's the cross. And and I
[1:18:39] understand that. But Calvary wasn't just
[1:18:41] the cross. Calvary was a tomb.
[1:18:44] Calvary was Cal Part of Calvary was
[1:18:47] preaching to souls in prison.
[1:18:49] Part of Calvary was raising out of the
[1:18:51] tomb. Part of Calvary was having an
[1:18:53] interactive conversation with part of
[1:18:55] his church. and and and that and then he
[1:18:57] he has to ascend to the father.
[1:19:00] So so so it's a it's an unfolding and
[1:19:03] brother Brandon would explain it simply
[1:19:04] this way. Calvary was his purchasing
[1:19:06] work but to claim the book if no one
[1:19:09] claims it. John who was at Calvary knew
[1:19:12] about Calvary first had a front row seat
[1:19:14] of Calvary is crying his eyes out having
[1:19:18] seen Calvary.
[1:19:19] Yeah
[1:19:19] because he knows if no one takes the
[1:19:21] book it's still all all is lost. And
[1:19:23] when he saw Christ, the same one he saw
[1:19:26] on the cross come and take the book and
[1:19:28] open it, he said, "All the heaven and
[1:19:29] earth." And everybody heard me shouting.
[1:19:33] Amen.
[1:19:34] So, so you know, if if if if they want
[1:19:36] to if they just want to wonder why I'm
[1:19:39] shouting, oh, you know, you're you're
[1:19:41] you just got a a view. You're a cult.
[1:19:43] You got this. You got that. It's nothing
[1:19:45] to do with any of that. It's that I see
[1:19:48] myself in the plan. It's that I have
[1:19:51] received that same life. How do you know
[1:19:52] you got the same one? Because it it
[1:19:55] changed my nature to act like the one I
[1:19:57] read about.
[1:20:00] Amen.
[1:20:01] Not everyone believed Melzdc.
[1:20:04] Lot barely believed him and barely
[1:20:06] escaped with his life and not even all
[1:20:08] of his family.
[1:20:09] Amen.
[1:20:11] The religious institution
[1:20:13] in the days of Jesus, they didn't
[1:20:16] recognize John.
[1:20:17] They didn't recognize Jesus. They
[1:20:19] thought he was a devil.
[1:20:20] Yeah.
[1:20:21] See? So,
[1:20:23] so when Jesus says, "I will be with you
[1:20:27] even in you,"
[1:20:29] then then her identity can be seen also
[1:20:36] in the word as as she walked through
[1:20:40] amen.
[1:20:40] The pages of the Bible.
[1:20:42] Amen.
[1:20:44] We're able to observe Sarah,
[1:20:47] Rahab,
[1:20:49] Ruth,
[1:20:51] Esther.
[1:20:52] We're able to observe that God always
[1:20:56] had the idea of a bride.
[1:20:59] Always had the idea of a family called
[1:21:03] Abraham, his friend. See, coming into
[1:21:06] the transitioning into the New
[1:21:09] Testament, from the Old Testament into
[1:21:10] the New Testament, we see an Elizabeth.
[1:21:12] We see a Mary.
[1:21:14] We see the early church whom John would
[1:21:17] later call the elect lady.
[1:21:20] So she's visible. Then we we find out in
[1:21:24] the when John heard a voice behind him
[1:21:26] and turned to see he said, "I saw one
[1:21:29] liken to the son of man and he's walking
[1:21:31] in the midst of the seven lampstands."
[1:21:33] But in the description of his garments,
[1:21:36] brother Brandham showed that we see the
[1:21:39] the the the bride symbolized. It's
[1:21:43] Christ Jesus walking, but it's the it's
[1:21:46] the bride symbolized in his garments and
[1:21:49] he's g about the paps like a woman and
[1:21:52] and and the garments go all the way down
[1:21:54] covering it. And he said it's just
[1:21:56] representative of being covered by the
[1:21:58] blood of Jesus Christ. So, at the end of
[1:22:00] the day, when you when you bring it all
[1:22:02] out and you you you flesh it all out,
[1:22:04] say, "Well, what am I looking at?"
[1:22:05] You're looking at Christ in his church
[1:22:08] through seven church ages.
[1:22:10] Amen.
[1:22:13] So, we find that he walked among the
[1:22:16] seven lampstands. We see her throughout
[1:22:19] Revelation. In in chapter one, she's
[1:22:21] made kings and priests. She's seen in a
[1:22:24] partial type and it's a partial type of
[1:22:26] the bride because it's also uh in
[1:22:29] another way you look at it. It's also
[1:22:30] the the uh remnant of the woman's seed,
[1:22:32] the unwise virgin. But we see in a
[1:22:35] partial type that this bride is as a
[1:22:37] great multitude that no man could number
[1:22:40] in chapter 7. We see her gathered as
[1:22:43] Mount Zion in chapter 14 with the
[1:22:46] 144,000 who are going to share the
[1:22:48] millennium with her.
[1:22:49] Amen. See, again, she's typed uh the
[1:22:53] type of the royal city, the holy
[1:22:55] Jerusalem, having the glory of God. In
[1:22:58] Revelation 21, we see her seated on the
[1:23:00] throne with the king speaking in one
[1:23:02] voice. In Revelation 22, the spirit and
[1:23:05] the bride say, "Come."
[1:23:06] Yes. Amen.
[1:23:08] See, there there's a new city and then
[1:23:10] there's the holy Jerusalem. And the
[1:23:12] Bible uses that exact language in on
[1:23:15] purpose. That's why when he says this
[1:23:17] the one holding the seventh vial which
[1:23:19] was the seventh angel to the seventh age
[1:23:22] and that's how brother Brandon was able
[1:23:23] to pitch a rock up in the air and say
[1:23:26] thus sayith the Lord judgment striking
[1:23:27] the west coast because that seventh vial
[1:23:29] partially opened just like all the vials
[1:23:31] are partially open just like all the
[1:23:33] seals had partially opened.
[1:23:35] They don't understand how that the
[1:23:36] seventh seal is hidden in the sixth seal
[1:23:39] because they say well the they're
[1:23:40] looking at it chronologically the sixth
[1:23:42] seal is the tribulation so it hasn't
[1:23:44] started yet. wrong.
[1:23:46] It started when the first woe and the
[1:23:49] first world war, the tribulation seal
[1:23:52] had already begun.
[1:23:54] Amen.
[1:23:55] See, but then an angel rises from the
[1:23:58] east having the seal of the living God.
[1:24:00] It's obviously the Holy Ghost. And he's
[1:24:02] saying now you're you're underway. The
[1:24:04] sixth seal has started. You're going to
[1:24:06] have a second woe and a third woe and
[1:24:08] it's going to sweep mankind from the
[1:24:09] earth. But first, I got to have a little
[1:24:11] interval of time. I got to send a
[1:24:13] gentile prophet down. I got to have a
[1:24:15] little uh I got to pause you while I
[1:24:18] send a gentile prophet down and gather a
[1:24:19] bride. And then when they go home, the
[1:24:22] eagle will fly east, pick up Moses and
[1:24:23] Elijah, and I got 144,000. And once I
[1:24:26] get all of that done and all of them
[1:24:28] sealed, then you can carry on.
[1:24:32] And they carry on in the second woe. And
[1:24:34] the second woe runs all the way into
[1:24:36] Revelation 11 and goes all the way into
[1:24:38] and now comes the end of the second wo.
[1:24:40] Behold, the third woe cometh quickly.
[1:24:42] I'm here to tell you something, friends.
[1:24:44] You can't make this stuff up. It's
[1:24:46] happening all around us. And our going
[1:24:48] home is very, very close.
[1:24:52] Amen.
[1:24:53] These things can't can't just have
[1:24:55] happened and fit the scriptures so
[1:24:57] perfectly.
[1:25:00] Amen.
[1:25:02] So it's not only his reliable nature
[1:25:07] but it we can see her reliable nature of
[1:25:11] faith that even in the face of
[1:25:16] what has to be sometimes almost
[1:25:18] inexplicable failure
[1:25:20] in the family of God.
[1:25:22] Amen.
[1:25:23] You're going to see that this plan
[1:25:27] is so secure
[1:25:30] that no failure of his family can stop
[1:25:33] her from inheriting it.
[1:25:37] See, she's not the the the new Jerusalem
[1:25:40] is the city, but the holy Jerusalem is a
[1:25:42] type of the bride. Because how's that a
[1:25:44] type of the bride? Because in Revelation
[1:25:46] 21, it says, "God shall himself, God
[1:25:51] himself shall dwell among them." I'm
[1:25:53] here to tell you, you are the temple of
[1:25:55] the Holy Ghost. You are the holy
[1:25:57] Jerusalem.
[1:25:59] We're a holy people, a holy Jerusalem,
[1:26:02] going to live in a new Jerusalem.
[1:26:05] All right, I can't get too far off the
[1:26:07] beaten path on that. Let me catch this
[1:26:10] for you.
[1:26:13] As I said, sometimes inexplicable
[1:26:15] failures in the flesh, even in the ranks
[1:26:16] of God's finest servants.
[1:26:18] Amen.
[1:26:19] Brother Brandon says in the Sardisian
[1:26:21] age, this is one of the other quotes
[1:26:23] that I'll read today.
[1:26:25] I'm already out of time. I'm halfway
[1:26:27] there.
[1:26:29] Just care sit sit still. I won't keep
[1:26:32] you too much longer
[1:26:34] because I think you're already getting
[1:26:35] it.
[1:26:38] So, brother Brandham says Sardisian
[1:26:40] church age, he that hath the seven
[1:26:43] spirits of God and the seven stars,
[1:26:44] Revelation 3:1, as this same Lord
[1:26:47] identified himself with man in the
[1:26:49] incarnation, he is again identifying
[1:26:50] himself with man by his spirit within
[1:26:53] man.
[1:26:54] Hallelujah.
[1:26:55] These are mine, sayaeth the Lord. The
[1:26:57] seven spiritfilled messengers are the
[1:27:00] Lord's. They may be repudiated. and how
[1:27:06] they may be questioned. Yeah. Oh, they
[1:27:09] got questions about the seventh one.
[1:27:10] Yeah. They had questions about the sixth
[1:27:12] one, the fifth one, the fourth one, the
[1:27:14] third one. It goes all the way back.
[1:27:16] They they were questioning the first
[1:27:17] one.
[1:27:18] They were questioning St. Paul.
[1:27:20] They're questioning Peter and John's
[1:27:22] authority.
[1:27:24] You know, so so that's not new.
[1:27:27] And so, you know, he says, so they may
[1:27:29] be repudiated. They may be questioned
[1:27:33] indeed. Now, here's an admission.
[1:27:35] Indeed, to human minds, they may not
[1:27:38] even seem to qualify.
[1:27:41] Nevertheless,
[1:27:42] they are the messengers for their age.
[1:27:44] Now, watch him prove what he just said
[1:27:47] by looking back in the Bible. God used
[1:27:49] an Abraham. He lied. He used a Moses. He
[1:27:54] rebelled.
[1:27:55] He used a Jonah. He disobeyed. He used a
[1:27:58] Samson. He sinned. He used a David. He
[1:28:02] murdered. He also used a Joshua and a
[1:28:05] Joseph. And those with severe blemishes
[1:28:08] far outnumber those whose history seemed
[1:28:11] to be perfect. All were and are his.
[1:28:17] None dare deny that he used them by and
[1:28:21] through the Holy Spirit that he put
[1:28:24] within them to their own master. This is
[1:28:26] Romans 14. to their own master they
[1:28:29] stood or fell and in them all was
[1:28:32] accomplished the sovereign will of God.
[1:28:35] Let external history attempt to refute
[1:28:38] this. It still stands. The eternal God
[1:28:41] still walks among the golden lampstands
[1:28:43] and sends his messengers by his spirit
[1:28:46] with the word to the people of every
[1:28:48] age. I'm glad I recognize my day and its
[1:28:51] message. Hallelujah.
[1:28:54] So, as we were saying to you, the Old
[1:28:56] Testament theophanes weren't merely
[1:29:00] representations of God, but they were
[1:29:02] actually appearances of Jesus before he
[1:29:05] was born of a woman. So we find then
[1:29:08] that the same God who walked in the
[1:29:11] garden of Eden, the same one who
[1:29:12] appeared to Abraham, the same one who
[1:29:14] manifested himself in a burning bush to
[1:29:17] Moses, uh that he ultimately became
[1:29:20] flesh in Jesus Christ. Uh and he was he
[1:29:23] was not a different being. Jesus wasn't
[1:29:26] a different being than Melzdc or the
[1:29:29] burning bush. He was he was just in
[1:29:32] another form. He's the only begotten of
[1:29:34] the father. It's still Christ. It's
[1:29:36] still the same eternal being. So he's so
[1:29:39] he's adapting his manifestation to
[1:29:42] humanity's capacity to receive it.
[1:29:46] So and to understand him. And this is
[1:29:48] what makes brother Brandham's breakdown
[1:29:49] of Melzdc so astonishing to modern
[1:29:52] theologians because the God we worship
[1:29:55] has been consistently and constantly
[1:29:58] what is he what's he been doing? He's
[1:30:01] been consistently drawing closer and
[1:30:05] closer to humanity.
[1:30:07] Amen.
[1:30:07] The God who was above then became with
[1:30:11] now becomes in.
[1:30:13] See, and so it's all coming. the
[1:30:15] implications really friends if once you
[1:30:17] once you begin to think of and this is
[1:30:19] where my mind has been because I I've
[1:30:21] thought how staggering these
[1:30:22] implications are because then every
[1:30:25] incident recorded in scripture becomes
[1:30:27] not just a message sent from God but
[1:30:30] it's as I said at the beginning it's a
[1:30:31] direct encounter with God and and and so
[1:30:34] we find then that that this encounter
[1:30:36] this direct encounter with the with the
[1:30:38] almighty God then is certainly certainly
[1:30:42] more than theological doctrine. Amen.
[1:30:45] You can argue all day long with
[1:30:48] theological doctrine.
[1:30:50] William Brham had to at times adjust his
[1:30:53] theological teaching.
[1:30:55] Amen.
[1:30:55] He says that himself. Don't throw
[1:30:57] something at me. He says that himself. I
[1:30:59] used to think this. He says that coming
[1:31:01] in the first seal. He's got seals on the
[1:31:05] back of the book that aren't even in the
[1:31:06] Bible. And then he comes two and a half
[1:31:08] years later and he says, "You know, I
[1:31:09] used to think that it was something
[1:31:11] outside the Bible, but I found out it
[1:31:14] can't be outside the Bible.
[1:31:16] I used to believe that love was the
[1:31:18] greatest evidence, but I got corrected
[1:31:20] that it's faith in the revealed word in
[1:31:22] every age."
[1:31:24] See, so so we realize then that that
[1:31:27] it's more than just doctrine. what what
[1:31:30] was consistent
[1:31:32] and his doctrine sometimes migrated and
[1:31:35] and amplified and it really sharpened.
[1:31:38] It never so much changed. If you look
[1:31:40] back at those because it's not wrong to
[1:31:43] say an evidence is love. It's not wrong
[1:31:46] to talk about well I'm just reading the
[1:31:48] scripture and it looks like something's
[1:31:49] on the back but here's here's the truth.
[1:31:51] There were seven seals and they were
[1:31:53] seventh under mystery and they have been
[1:31:55] open. That's all true. See? So, so all
[1:31:58] it's not he's changing. He said, "I
[1:32:00] never had to change anything in my
[1:32:01] life." He He's just simply meaning that
[1:32:04] he adjusted and the lens got sharper and
[1:32:06] sharper and sharper. I'm here to tell
[1:32:08] you today, I'm glad we're not still the
[1:32:10] infant bride of the early 1960s. We're
[1:32:12] not still the adolescent of the 70s and
[1:32:14] the 80s and going through the 90s. He
[1:32:16] was never coming back to marry a
[1:32:18] 12-year-old girl. He was never coming
[1:32:20] back to marry just a young woman. He's
[1:32:22] coming to marry a mature bride ready to
[1:32:24] be a queen.
[1:32:27] So, sure, we've acted at times like
[1:32:30] children. Sure, sometimes. I mean, I
[1:32:34] think of some of the things I did as a
[1:32:36] teenager, I didn't even want you to know
[1:32:37] them,
[1:32:38] right? Amen.
[1:32:40] And what made it worse is when I was a
[1:32:42] teenager, I thought I knew everything.
[1:32:46] And that was probably my biggest
[1:32:48] mistake. Amen.
[1:32:52] So, it's not just about
[1:32:54] is the doctrine consistent. Did he say
[1:32:56] one thing here, but then looks like he
[1:32:58] changed something over here. Okay. Okay.
[1:33:01] You got him.
[1:33:03] He changed something from here to here.
[1:33:05] Okay. Wow. But the pillar of fire didn't
[1:33:08] change.
[1:33:09] The gift never missed.
[1:33:11] He absolutely walked with God and that
[1:33:13] was proven. and around the world and a
[1:33:16] world he went he went and would say from
[1:33:18] public venues all around the world if
[1:33:20] anybody can show one time it's ever been
[1:33:21] wrong step forward now no one ever did
[1:33:26] oh it's easy to go after him 70 years
[1:33:29] later when witnesses are dead but nobody
[1:33:31] tried that when they were alive you know
[1:33:33] that's why they don't attack you
[1:33:35] you realize that's why they only attack
[1:33:37] your prophet cuz he's dead
[1:33:39] what they because they can't come after
[1:33:41] us because we have witnesses that the
[1:33:43] blind eyes are opened, that deaf ears
[1:33:46] are open, that the lame walk, that the
[1:33:48] dead are raised. We've got living
[1:33:50] witnesses that we can bring and say, "He
[1:33:51] was dead. He came back to life. She was
[1:33:53] blind and her eyes have opened." Well, I
[1:33:55] I in my own ministry, I've seen those
[1:33:57] things happen.
[1:33:59] Amen.
[1:34:01] See, so what what's going to be the root
[1:34:04] awakening is when the bride is gone
[1:34:08] and then the the sickening reality
[1:34:12] when they have to confess that little
[1:34:13] man was right.
[1:34:16] I'd like to say it now. I don't want to
[1:34:17] say it then. I want to say it now.
[1:34:20] See? So, so, so that's why I said a
[1:34:23] while ago really the the the message as
[1:34:26] vital as it is the information I meaning
[1:34:29] the information portion that you get
[1:34:32] that almost I don't want to say it pales
[1:34:35] but by comparison something that's much
[1:34:38] greater is this fact God has made
[1:34:41] himself known to you
[1:34:44] amen
[1:34:47] and you're you're probably
[1:34:50] you know less than 1%
[1:34:53] of humanity
[1:34:54] around the earth.
[1:34:56] Amen.
[1:34:56] And God has made himself known to you.
[1:35:01] And you're not even perfect.
[1:35:04] And you stumble and you make mistakes
[1:35:07] and and you can be repudiated. But what
[1:35:09] cannot be repudiated is my faith in the
[1:35:13] presence of God in my life. I know my
[1:35:17] redeemer liveth.
[1:35:19] I'm painfully aware I make mistakes. I'm
[1:35:22] painfully aware of all my past. But I
[1:35:24] know this. I'm covered by the blood. I
[1:35:26] know this that he chose me. I know this
[1:35:28] that I'm part of the unfolding mystery
[1:35:30] of almighty God. And I know I am because
[1:35:33] I've got the same character
[1:35:36] that I see in the word of God.
[1:35:40] See, so this is what Paul dealt with
[1:35:43] them and those devout Jews when they
[1:35:45] heard and you know, you've got to
[1:35:48] repent. And so then Paul comes back, I
[1:35:50] think it's Acts 13, might be 16. I think
[1:35:52] it's 13 where Paul goes back and looks
[1:35:55] at the at the at that pre at the pre
[1:35:57] Christ days blood of bulls and goats. He
[1:36:00] said, "Now God winked at that ignorance.
[1:36:02] He allowed that. He winked at your
[1:36:04] ignorance. He didn't know any better.
[1:36:05] The lamb hadn't come. But now, now he's
[1:36:08] come. Now Calvary has happened. Now he's
[1:36:11] ascended. Now he's sent his spirit back.
[1:36:13] It's in the church. And now you must do
[1:36:16] what Peter said. You must repent.
[1:36:19] Amen.
[1:36:20] So, you can't come down like at the
[1:36:22] first of the age. You no way to come
[1:36:24] down at the end time and say, "I just
[1:36:27] don't need a prophetic message. I don't
[1:36:29] need all of that. I just believe
[1:36:31] Calvary. I just believe Jesus." Listen,
[1:36:34] God winked at a lot of things down
[1:36:35] through the church ages when they didn't
[1:36:37] understand him clearly. But now that
[1:36:40] time is over and you have come to the
[1:36:42] you have come to Mount Zion, not to not
[1:36:44] to, you know, not Cyani. You've come to
[1:36:47] the city of the living God.
[1:36:50] You've got to stand and be identified
[1:36:52] with the word of God in your hour if you
[1:36:55] want to go in the rapture.
[1:36:56] That's right. Amen.
[1:36:58] Oh my.
[1:37:00] Praise God.
[1:37:01] So, it's been God rich in mercy every
[1:37:03] age revealing the truth and the
[1:37:06] significance of his appearing. It's
[1:37:08] always been to an elected people. And I
[1:37:12] I think I could safely say that had God
[1:37:16] not been revealing himself
[1:37:18] like this through the ages, in every
[1:37:20] age, well, I I don't I don't think
[1:37:24] mankind could have survived till now.
[1:37:27] Amen.
[1:37:28] I think it would have already been
[1:37:30] destroyed. Amen. Turn me on right here.
[1:37:34] Amen.
[1:37:36] Praise the Lord. Amen. Sorry, I know
[1:37:39] this microphone to those streaming
[1:37:42] doesn't sound as good, but u
[1:37:54] microphone.
[1:37:56] Amen. We call him the great white shark.
[1:37:59] Amen. Don't get in a debate with him. He
[1:38:01] eats you.
[1:38:05] Amen, precious brother.
[1:38:08] Y'all don't even know who that is.
[1:38:11] Amen. That's two different people that
[1:38:13] is named, but that's an inside joke.
[1:38:18] So, you come then I want to take these
[1:38:20] last 14 minutes and I'll watch that
[1:38:21] clock and I'll stop. 14 minutes. You
[1:38:23] good?
[1:38:24] I know we got to get to a baptism right
[1:38:26] away.
[1:38:31] And I won't cover all this. I'm just
[1:38:32] going to get this one. And I said you'd
[1:38:34] get a workout on the overhead, but we're
[1:38:36] just going to look we're just going to
[1:38:37] look at one or two.
[1:38:40] You come to this this principle and the
[1:38:43] unfolding of God that I'm going to just
[1:38:45] label for the for the lack of a better
[1:38:48] label and I'm going to call it the
[1:38:49] principle of greater.
[1:38:51] Let's have John chapter 4, brother Mark.
[1:38:54] John chapter 4. All right, I still got
[1:38:58] 13 minutes. Everybody still awake? Y
[1:39:02] so in John chapter 4
[1:39:06] there's the first time that this kind of
[1:39:08] a challenge is going to come to Jesus.
[1:39:11] It's going to happen a bunch of times.
[1:39:13] I'm not going to take the time to read
[1:39:14] them all today. We'll catch it next
[1:39:16] time. But let's catch this one. In John
[1:39:19] 4:es 10-16, Jesus answered and said unto
[1:39:22] her, as a woman at the well, "If thou
[1:39:25] knest the gift of God,
[1:39:29] you know what? I might be in less
[1:39:31] trouble if I use this."
[1:39:35] Praise the Lord.
[1:39:40] Testing. You got me. Okay. Amen. was
[1:39:44] trying to avoid trouble down the road.
[1:39:48] Jesus answered and said unto her,
[1:39:51] "If thou kneest the gift of God, and who
[1:39:54] it is that saith to thee, Give me to
[1:39:58] drink, thou wouldest have asked of him,
[1:40:02] and he would have given thee living
[1:40:03] water." The woman saith unto him, "Sir,
[1:40:07] hast, thou hast nothing to draw with,
[1:40:10] and the well is deep. from whence then
[1:40:14] hast thou that living water? Verse 12.
[1:40:18] Art thou greater than our father Jacob,
[1:40:22] which gave us the well, and drank
[1:40:24] thereof himself and his children and his
[1:40:28] cattle. And Jesus answered and said unto
[1:40:31] her, Whosoever drinkketh of this water
[1:40:34] shall never thirst again. But whoso
[1:40:38] drinkkeeth of the water that I shall
[1:40:40] give him shall never thirst. I think I
[1:40:43] read that right. Of this water shall
[1:40:44] thirst again. But whosoever drinkkeeth
[1:40:46] of the water that I shall give him shall
[1:40:48] never thirst. But the water that I shall
[1:40:50] give him shall be in him a well of water
[1:40:53] springing up into everlasting life. The
[1:40:56] woman saith unto him, "Sir, give me this
[1:40:59] water that I thirst not, neither come
[1:41:02] hither to draw." Jesus saith to her, go
[1:41:06] and go call thy husband and come hither.
[1:41:09] Now, no one gathered at this moment that
[1:41:14] this would actually become a parallel to
[1:41:16] our day. And in fact is Jesus first clue
[1:41:21] doesn't even come till the 17th chapter
[1:41:24] of the gospel of Luke near the end of
[1:41:26] his ministry. And he says, "As it was in
[1:41:28] the days of Noah, as it was in the days
[1:41:31] of Lot, so shall it be in the coming of
[1:41:34] the son of man." And so this is exactly
[1:41:36] why brother Brandon would constantly go
[1:41:38] back to St. John 4 because this is the
[1:41:42] first time where they're going to ask
[1:41:43] something about Jesus. Art thou greater
[1:41:46] than? Well, you know, what are you
[1:41:48] saying about yourself? Now, there
[1:41:50] there's a number of places um that that
[1:41:54] we won't we won't turn to them, but you
[1:41:56] but I'll just make go go go very
[1:41:58] quickly. I said I wasn't going to do
[1:41:59] this, but I'm going to have to do it.
[1:42:01] So, you remember and I'm just going to
[1:42:03] refer to it in Matthew 12 where where
[1:42:05] Jesus is talking about the temple. And I
[1:42:08] say unto you that in this place, uh he
[1:42:11] he says here in in verse uh six, but I
[1:42:14] say unto you that in this place is one
[1:42:16] greater than the temple. And so they're
[1:42:18] they're all proud of their temple. And
[1:42:21] Jesus is saying there's one greater than
[1:42:23] the temple. You're looking right at him
[1:42:25] and you don't even realize there's one
[1:42:27] greater. And he goes then and then
[1:42:29] that's then that's where if you if you
[1:42:32] keep following the progression, he had
[1:42:34] he had he had went to Matthew 11:11
[1:42:38] concerning John.
[1:42:39] And he says, John, there's no one
[1:42:43] greater than John. Of course, that's
[1:42:44] true because John was the last of the
[1:42:47] Old Testament prophets. And brother
[1:42:49] Brandon makes two points of what made
[1:42:51] John greater. First of all, he was
[1:42:54] greater than David. You say he was
[1:42:55] greater than David? Yes. Because John,
[1:42:58] like Jesus, had no place to lay his
[1:43:01] head.
[1:43:02] David lived in a palace.
[1:43:04] And and so John in that sense was
[1:43:07] greater than David because with nothing
[1:43:09] he did everything. And he said, and then
[1:43:12] he said, Brother Brandham then shows in
[1:43:14] the third seal how that the the thing
[1:43:16] that made John greater is he was an
[1:43:19] angel to a dispensation. So he's a
[1:43:21] dispensational messenger. And so he's
[1:43:24] the greatest up to that point of all the
[1:43:26] Old Testament prophets. But then Jesus
[1:43:28] would turn right around and forecast and
[1:43:31] foretell that there's a church coming,
[1:43:33] there's a kingdom coming, and when that
[1:43:35] kingdom is born, the very least one of
[1:43:38] those will be greater than John. Now,
[1:43:41] he's not talking about the character of
[1:43:43] the person. He's not talking about the
[1:43:46] quality of the individual. He's talking
[1:43:48] about the dispensation that they would
[1:43:50] live in.
[1:43:51] And and no matter how great David was,
[1:43:54] Moses was, John was, all of them were
[1:43:56] were, God still was above them and could
[1:43:59] only come upon them and could not remain
[1:44:01] on them until Jesus. And then the spirit
[1:44:04] remained on him. And then he went home
[1:44:06] and sent his life back. And then the
[1:44:08] Holy Ghost comes on you and I. And the
[1:44:10] least in the kingdom is greater than
[1:44:12] John.
[1:44:13] You say, "Brother Jason, what's the real
[1:44:15] point you're making?" The point I'm
[1:44:16] trying to show you is is it's constantly
[1:44:19] a progression, a progression, a
[1:44:21] progression. He's all the time going
[1:44:23] forward. Oh my. How then could we
[1:44:26] wonder, my precious friends, of why we
[1:44:30] had to have a message in this last day?
[1:44:32] Because he, you say, well, he was going
[1:44:34] forward. We're going forward through the
[1:44:36] ages. it was working great till you get
[1:44:38] to the end and at the end they throw
[1:44:40] Christ out at the end they can't even go
[1:44:43] in the rapture and they can't get any
[1:44:45] better and so he's got to come back and
[1:44:47] restore back the faith the original
[1:44:50] faith of the fathers so why so that now
[1:44:53] Mrs. Jesus Christ, the one who he's been
[1:44:56] waiting to get to for for all these
[1:44:58] thousands of years. She's here. And
[1:45:01] that's why Brother Brandon would say,
[1:45:02] "You in Tucson, you in New York City,
[1:45:05] you in Phoenix, you here and there. Uh
[1:45:07] this is the day the bride has made
[1:45:10] herself ready." I'm here to tell you
[1:45:12] something, friends. That's the hour that
[1:45:14] we have arrived at
[1:45:17] because it's greater. It's greater. It's
[1:45:19] greater. They said to him, you know, uh,
[1:45:22] they're talking about Jonah. He says,
[1:45:25] greater than Jonah's here. They start
[1:45:27] talking about Solomon. Greater than
[1:45:29] Solomon is here.
[1:45:30] Art thou greater than this one? Art thou
[1:45:33] greater than than our father Abraham
[1:45:36] before Abraham was.
[1:45:38] I am.
[1:45:40] And and they're constantly saying, "Who
[1:45:43] are you making yourself out to be? Are
[1:45:45] you greater than this one? Are you
[1:45:47] greater than that one?" And brother
[1:45:48] Brandon would say, notice that he
[1:45:50] promised in the scripture that greater
[1:45:53] than this will you do, more than this
[1:45:56] will you do cuz I go to my father. They
[1:45:59] didn't want Jesus to go. And Jesus says
[1:46:02] it's expedient for you
[1:46:04] that I go. It's it's advantageous for
[1:46:08] you. It's better off for you if I go
[1:46:12] because if I don't go, the train stops.
[1:46:14] Y
[1:46:16] see, if I don't go, the train stops. But
[1:46:20] if I go, I'll come again. Oh,
[1:46:22] hallelujah. I'm here to tell you
[1:46:23] something, friends. It's not about
[1:46:25] character because I would not dare try
[1:46:27] to put my character up against that
[1:46:29] early church and the things they went
[1:46:30] through. But I know this. I have the
[1:46:32] same revelation that they had. I know
[1:46:35] that I'm part of the same unfolding. Who
[1:46:37] is this Melzdc? It's none other than
[1:46:39] Almighty God. Who is the bride of the
[1:46:42] last day? It's none other than Mrs.
[1:46:44] Jesus Christ, bone of his bone, flesh of
[1:46:46] his flesh, life of his life, word of his
[1:46:48] word, faith of his faith.
[1:46:52] This is this is a big deal. This is the
[1:46:54] biggest deal the whole world will ever
[1:46:56] see and the last sign they will ever
[1:46:59] see. And you and I are it.
[1:47:02] That's right.
[1:47:04] You say, "Who else?" Just just just you
[1:47:05] and I. No. Paul said, and I'm so glad he
[1:47:08] said it like this. All those who love
[1:47:12] his appearing. say, "But Jason, are you
[1:47:14] trying to be an elitist? Are you trying
[1:47:17] to include yourself and exclude the
[1:47:20] world?" No, I'm simply saying that
[1:47:22] here's the condition that that there is
[1:47:25] waiting for me. Paul said, "A crown of
[1:47:26] righteousness that the righteous judge
[1:47:28] shall give me and not to me only, but to
[1:47:31] all them who have loved his appearing."
[1:47:34] I'm here to tell you something, friends.
[1:47:36] When I when I saw his appearing, when I
[1:47:38] look at his appearing in this day, I
[1:47:40] don't understand all the teachings. I
[1:47:42] don't understand. I can't put it put it
[1:47:44] all together clearly in my mind. But I
[1:47:46] know this. I've loved the one who has
[1:47:48] appeared.
[1:47:49] I've loved that nature. I've loved that

[1:54:38] Amen.
[1:54:40] Praise the Lord.
[1:54:42] Brother Caleb, second time around. Amen.
[1:54:45] Praise the Lord. Uh we were talking
[1:54:47] about this before I left for Poland. And
[1:54:49] then when I got back, I had to remember
[1:54:51] who was it I was talking to. Amen. And
[1:54:54] so I I wrote u I thought was it brother
[1:54:58] Micah? And then I remembered I had just
[1:55:00] I thought wait I just rebaptized Micah.
[1:55:03] And when I wrote I but I'd already asked
[1:55:05] him was it you? He goes no sir and I got
[1:55:07] the video to prove it.
[1:55:12] I said oh yeah that's right. I
[1:55:13] rebaptized you after Sister Esther made
[1:55:16] an honest Christian out of you.
[1:55:19] And he agreed. He amened that. And I
[1:55:21] amended it right behind him. And I said,
[1:55:23] I I know that all too well. Many uh men
[1:55:26] who uh just needed a good woman to Amen.
[1:55:29] bring them that much closer to the Lord.
[1:55:31] So, Amen. Praise the Lord, brother. So,
[1:55:35] your wife is doing a good job. Amen.
[1:55:37] Praise the Lord. Amen. I remember
[1:55:39] brother Dale, I was talking to brother
[1:55:41] Dale and
[1:55:43] nobody but brother Dale could say it
[1:55:45] like this and such a redneck but and I
[1:55:49] was talking to him on the phone and
[1:55:51] driving through town and I said, you
[1:55:52] know, Brother Dale, we started talking
[1:55:53] about the scripture where one said, "Oh,
[1:55:56] I've I've bought a piece of land. I go
[1:55:58] to look at it. Pray have me excused. I
[1:56:01] bought a a yolk of ox and I got to go
[1:56:03] prove it. Pray have me excused." And I
[1:56:05] said, you know, Brother Dale, I said,
[1:56:07] all these men were like, "Have me
[1:56:09] excused. Have me excused." And and you
[1:56:11] know, we we went all through this list
[1:56:13] and we were both getting excited. And I
[1:56:14] said, "Can can you believe uh that this
[1:56:18] man married a wife and this man bought a
[1:56:20] land and this man bought a yolk of
[1:56:22] oxygen?" And brother Dale said, "Huh, I
[1:56:24] married a wife and she makes me go."
[1:56:28] So I laughed all the way up the road. We
[1:56:31] still laugh over that one. Amen. Praise
[1:56:33] the Lord. But brother Caleb, we're so
[1:56:36] proud of you. Amen. I appreciate this
[1:56:38] decision. It's a critical hour. And you
[1:56:41] know, I just like brother Homer Brown's
[1:56:44] his philosophy was if there's if there's
[1:56:46] any question in your heart. No, not even
[1:56:48] it don't have to be a question about am
[1:56:50] I born again? Am I have I accepted? It's
[1:56:52] not really about that. That's not why I
[1:56:54] got rebaptized. I just did it young and
[1:56:56] then I wanted to do it again as a young
[1:56:58] man. I got rebaptized there at the
[1:57:00] Brandon Tabernacle because it was on my
[1:57:02] heart. I wanted the whole world to know
[1:57:05] that that when I was a little boy, I
[1:57:08] stood for Jesus, but as a young man, I
[1:57:10] wanted them to know again I stand for
[1:57:13] the Lord Jesus. Amen. So, we're happy
[1:57:16] today to bring you back to the water
[1:57:19] again to be rebaptized as a testimony of
[1:57:22] continuing faith in the name of the Lord
[1:57:24] Jesus Christ. Amen. Have a seat right
[1:57:26] there. Uh, it's okay. Yeah. Oh, brother
[1:57:30] John Linichek didn't love you as much as
[1:57:32] brother Luther. Yeah, this water is not
[1:57:36] warm. Amen. Praise the Lord. Brother
[1:57:38] Luther would have you bathtub water
[1:57:39] waiting, but Amen. Praise the Lord,
[1:57:41] brother. Let's all Let's pray. Father,
[1:57:45] what a grand time, Lord, we've had in
[1:57:48] your word today, all the singing and
[1:57:50] worship. My goodness, what a place to be
[1:57:52] on a Sunday coming forward, Lord, from
[1:57:55] the word of God, our brother. Lord,
[1:57:58] before we preach the sermon, he wanted
[1:58:00] to come here. Now that we've preached
[1:58:02] the sermon today, he still wants to
[1:58:04] identify with this wonderful reality
[1:58:06] that is you, the person of Jesus Christ.
[1:58:09] Lord, I pray today that that the purpose
[1:58:12] of his heart will be satisfied before
[1:58:14] your presence, Lord, as we take him down
[1:58:16] in water baptism in your name. May you
[1:58:20] meet that great desire that's burning in
[1:58:22] his heart. Lord, I pray, Father, you're
[1:58:24] so faithful to that. You're so reliably
[1:58:27] faithful. We love you for that very
[1:58:29] reason. We believe you, Lord. We could
[1:58:31] never not believe you. So we commit it
[1:58:33] to you now today in Jesus lovely name.
[1:58:36] Amen. Praise the Lord. Brother Caleb,
[1:58:38] you can Amen. Cover that. I'm going to
[1:58:40] put you down and bring you right back
[1:58:41] up. When's the last time you did it?
[1:58:44] Nine years old. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:58:46] Amen.
