========================================

god mr wesley spent two hours daily in prairie began at four in the morning of him one who knew him well wrote he thought prayer to be more his business than anything else and i've seen him come out of his closet with the serenity of faith next to shining john fletcher stained the wall john fletcher was kind of the after wesley went off the scene john fletcher was actually his secretary and he kind of carried the mantle forward after he went off the scene john fletcher stained the walls of his room by the breath of his prayer sometimes he would pray all night always frequently and with great earnestness his whole life was a life of prayer i would not rise from my seat he said without lifting my heart to god his greeting to a friend was always do i meet you praying luther said if i fail to spend two hours in prayer each morning the devil gets the victory through the day i have so much business i cannot get on without spending three hours daily in prayer he had a motto he that has prayed well has studied well amen that that's a great way of thinking we think i've got so much to do today i can't spend time in prayer but luther was like well i've got so much to do i better increase my time of prayer so that i can get it all done that's the right way of that's the biblical way of thinking mark 11 24 i think this goes to the heart of the matter therefore i say unto you what things soever you desire when you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them why does it go to the heart of the matter it's what you desire and that is what comes from the heart if you desire worldly things you're going to seek after worldly things if you desire heavenly things you'll seek after heavenly things so your desire needs to change if your if your mind is on earthly things it means you need to ask the lord touch the desires that i have in my heart because they're not they're not going in the right direction i need them to go in the right direction prayer starts with desire it's as simple as that god place there's a desire in your heart what should your response be i'm going to go solve the problem pray that's our first reaction that's our first thing that we should do when a desire hits our heart begin to pray whatever you desire when you pray all right so that's the start desire births prayer then then what do we do next believe if you look at the english standard version here it says believe that you have received it so the tense is past tense so you you desire it you pray and then what do you do you believe i've already got it it's already mine it's already the promise is there so it's just as good as mine if you do that then it'll be yours but if you pray and you're just mumbling words and you're just saying what you think you ought to say with no desire behind it you're got it out of order if your desire is wrong then you've got to pray lord fix this my weak desires i'm instead of seeking after the great things which are heavenly things i'm seeking after mud and filth and garbage that's what the things of the world are you know it's not it's not that our when we seek after the things of the world it's not that our desires are are are too strong it's that they're too weak we're going after the things that provide no satisfaction no happiness no nothing good in your life if our desire was strong enough we'd be seeking after eternal things we'd be looking after eternal things we'd have an eternal vision instead of an earthly vision the things that you want god's vision is eternal when he says i'm going to work everything out for good that doesn't mean you're going to have a mansion and a lamborghini or a ps5 or whatever your desire is for the nicest computer the nicest this the nicest that no it's it's something completely different that god is trying to do in our life it's eternal good that's why we that's why we go through suffering now because god is seeking our eternal good you say oh that's how can suffering be good well the only reason you say that is because you don't have the mind of christ if you had the mind of christ you'd know that the things that we suffer and struggle with and the trials that we face are working something in us an eternal weight of glory something that will never fade that will never fail you know these paul says these momentary light if afflictions i mean look what paul was going through we we probably wouldn't say they were momentary or light but paul with the eyes of eternity said these momentary light afflictions are working for me an eternal weight of glory i don't want to get sidetracked by that thought but i'm just feeling inspired by that in other words the things that you're going through right now the suffering that you're experiencing now has eternal value you know in other words the the even the smallest thing that you suffer for the sake of the gospel god is watching that and you going through that with faith and love in your heart there is a reward for going through that it's creating it's creating something it's you know brother branham talks about the theophany creating the vi the take feeding on the word creates the vitamins for that theophany body it's building a body the suffering that we go through is creating a particular a peculiar glory that's specifically yours in eternity so a specific reward a specific thing so we shouldn't look at well i'm suffering i'm having trials i went through this thing how terrible god sees he knows exactly what you've gone through and when you go through it with faith there is an eternal reward let's lord help us to think with eternity in mind not be so short-sighted so limited to here we're gonna if we're gonna be closer over there than we are here then we i think we need to start thinking more eternal thoughts i'm going to skip a few things here brother branham says in the angel in the commission night time when all demon powers shut down towards mourning when they're not roaming that's the time the holy spirit moves in and talks to me go early if you want to pray rise up early that's scriptural read psalm 63 david says he rose up early and sought after god if you're not a morning person i i have become not a morning person i need to change that and become a morning person again so that i can have those morning hours with the lord i mean if brother branham says that the demon power shut down i mean you know that if you get up early get your cup of coffee at least for me first and now you can think clearly there's such a there's such a peace and a uh there's a peacefulness and a quiet that comes in the morning why is it because brother madam said the demon power is shut down towards what there's nothing to work through there's there's no they can't work through anything so now you can get up and quickly feel the presence of the lord in your prayer closet embounds in power through prayer says to pray is the greatest thing we can do and to do it well there must be calmness time and deliberation otherwise it is great degraded into the littlest and meanest of things true praying has the largest results for good and poor praying the least we cannot do too much of the re of real praying we cannot do too little of the sham we must learn a new the wondrous art we must not give a fragment here in a fragment there a little talk with jesus as the tiny saints sing but we must demand and hold with iron grasp the best hours of the day for god in prayer or there will be no praying worth the name i think we miss we miss the power that we have through prayer we want to change things with our actions we see certain situations and say i don't like what's happening here i don't like what's happening there and then we go and try to do something instead of the fact that god showed us that whatever it was so that we could pray because when we pray you know what happens your heart gets right in the situation usually when you get upset and you try to affect a change with your words or your actions mostly it's wrong because you're wrong you might have been right in your in your judgment of the circumstances in the situation but your heart was wrong because you approached it because you're frustrated instead of praying that should be our very first thing that we do and that's the greatest thing that we can do um skip that and we'll just finish here brother branham says in a hidden life in christ but then your bedroom is your place of rest and after the toil of a weary day always alone in the room resting at my house the prayer room is the bedroom many times i've went into little old homes and see them mothers and so forth come out of the bedroom with a little old checkered apron on wiping her eyes crying praying secret place meeting place alone with god isolated oh it's a marvelous place to be amen may i i'm just my desire in speaking about this was one for myself to renew my heart and burden and passion for prayer and two just to pass that along to you at the same time i'm doing that because that's the place that we have power that's the place that us as a church will have impact on this world and for souls for christ is out of prayer it's not just taking action and planning the program and planning this program oh that's good but without prayer being the functional start of that it's birthed out of the wrong place out of the wrong motive prayer is where we communicate with god it's where we hear from god and god hears from us it's where we listen and he speaks to us because he wants to do that personally to each and every one of us that's not just for the preachers and the prophet but he will communicate with each of us in the way that he's training you and teaching you and so you have but you have to get alone with him you have to get quiet you have to take time you have to make a choice and a decision this is what i want to be important in my life prayer not all these other things and hobbies and all that but prayer should be our our most important feature of our life let's stand up heavenly father we just come before you lord and we're so thankful for your grace lord we ask that your holy spirit would just continue to to brood over your people lord create a hunger and thirst and desire in each of us lord for prayer lord we ask that your your presence would come lord through the worship and through the preaching of the word today lord that you would be glorified and lord that we would be built up and edified in our faith we ask these things in the name of jesus christ amen amen god bless you for those of you visiting we'll take a short break and then the regular service will begin [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] is
