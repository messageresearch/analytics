your desire today god bless you greets in the name of the Lord happy to have you all here in God's house amen we were having him a good time in the Sunday School class this morning I know it's difficult to get the whole class for those of you who are going to be in the regular service because you're you'd be late but but hopefully you whatever part you couldn't quite get maybe you stream it on the way but you want to make sure you go back and get that because we're taking an in-depth study on the entire book of Revelation gonna take a while and we're gonna go through it slowly because I believe it's the brides book I believe it's it's really has its moment in these last days Amen it was sealed up but it was promised that it would be opened up at the end time and we believe it amen we can see it live and that's how we know that it's the word and man lives in you and I praise the Lord Amen want to just thank you all for your prayers and the food and the flowers and the different things that's been brought to the house so much food I'm gonna probably gain 900 pounds trying to eat it all and so we we've got plenty and sister Brenda kept coming with more and more and then when she got done more and more and it's wonderful and especially the sweets oh I'm supposed to say that amen praise the Lord so Amen those those cookies sister Brenda Wow and give Haley a run for her money on her peanut butter cookies they were they're not peanut butter cookies that she made they're like walnut and chocolate chip but boy they were good no you can't have any amens I'm gonna hoard them for sure amen but I just want to appreciate you all for the prayers and the cards and the flowers and the visits and phone calls and it's been wonderful and sister Debbie's making good progress and every test she takes comes back with good results and no serious issues whatsoever just some stress borne upper GI complications and a lot of inflammation stress stress induced because the situation that suddenly came upon us our family with declining health of her mom and dad that came out of nowhere they were fine one day and the next day you know her dad's on dialysis her mom seems to be fading out and and so but we've got a lot of that under control the Lord has really been gracious so that's kind of lowered the stress level down and appreciate all the care of the medical staff here at the church have had all of them working on her amen so they've been working together and getting her better a man I can't do without her so I keep telling reminding the Lord of that amen oh no you're right brother shouldn't have confessed that I knew you'd be streaming oh my okay I'll go back on that diet for sure no problem amen I just got busted but I am enjoying my my um my all my food amen so praise the Lord we're happy to have you here today and I just wanted to pass along those comments thank you for your prayers and let's look in the book of Revelation this morning want to continue and hopefully the Lord willing we plan to finish up this three-part series looks like it's going to be in three I should be able to get it today and we want to conclude this series titled the end of the eden compromise how many know that was a fateful compromise that was made there in Eden to choose the tree of knowledge of good and evil over the Tree of Life and it has had a devastating consequence on the earth ever since when the Lord you know descended in this hour according to revelation 10 he found the world in a catastrophe and so we're you know but thankful he brought an open word it's not designed to save the world it's designed to say cuz he's gonna save the word he's gonna change it but he's going to save his family out of it before it goes off the cliff and God's not going to destroy it God loves life he doesn't he's not a destroyer of life he often just simply pulls out all the stops and and man destroys himself and so it's too bad it's sad that but no one will be able to impugn that's why when you read the either Matthew 25 at the judgment bar or you go over in the book of Revelation to the judgment bar you don't find anybody crying foul nobody's jumping up all is unfair you know you know you're you're you're you're not giving me justice and that nobody every man knows at that moment that they have earned their way to destruction and the Lord tried every way even more ways than men could imagine to save man he doesn't take pleasure even in the death of the sinner God would that all men come to repentance don't ever forget that friends don't ever let your your attitude become so jaded with the things that you see going on in the world that you lose sight of the love of God and no matter what you might be seeing a person act out in a certain way remember Jesus died for them and and and maybe all they need is a little bit of love see and and somebody to tell them about the love of God somebody's brother Fred Mullins says I want I'm trying to tell everybody about somebody who can help anybody Amen I love that praise the Lord in Revelation chapter 21 let me get started here we shouldn't be too long today I should be able to finish it up pretty easily and get right to it just want to finish out the burdens upon my heart for the word I don't believe I had any other announcements or prayer requests that came to me if you have some and you're streaming and you want to send it if you send it to me by text it'll probably hit my device here and I'll see it revelation 21 we'll get to catch verses one to five I think that's what I gave you hey Josh you know one to five yeah to Revelation 21:1 to five amen and I saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there was no more sea and I John saw the holy city the New Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband and I heard a great voice out of heaven saying behold the tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God and shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death in that wonderful neither sorrow nor crying neither neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away and he that sat listen at this concluding promise and he that sat upon the throne said behold I make all things new and he said unto me write for these words are true and faithful so we want to just bow our heads now and ask the Lord to bless the reading of his word father we thank you for your word we commit we are committing ourselves our whole hearts to your word today be with us now as we try to deliver this thought that is upon my heart now Lord let it be for the strength for the direction Lord for the people to be able to face and be overcomers of the of the challenges that we see today Lord the earth is in a condition that I don't think any of us quite foresaw it turning out like it has been and Lord we know that it's only going to get worse it can never go back to normal it's only it's a new normal and then this one will get worse and then this one won't be returned to and then that one will get worse and that one won't be returned to its according to your prophecy Lord it's going toward its conclusion it's irreversible it's unstoppable and Lord it's all part of your plan you're going to renew it you're not going to destroy the world you're going to renew it and father we thank you that you've given us your word that we might be a part of your divine renewal we commit it and ourselves into your hands in Jesus name Amen god bless you as you're seated Josh I didn't send it to you but let's uh let's go to second Corinthians five and I just want to read a single verse second Corinthians 5:17 one verse here thank you brother Luther second Corinthians 5:7 which is that right let's see yep thank are the ends 5:17 therefore if any man be in Christ he is a new creature old things are passed away and here's that term again behold all things are become new I I love that verse because God is showing that he's going to the same way he redeems you he's redeeming the earth same way redeemed the earth he's redeeming you we came from the earth we are part of his his expression he expressed the earth for you to live in and it's an eternal attribute of God it can never be annihilated it's going to be renovated and by his spoken word which is amazing and and and wonderful because it was his original word that built it so he's going to go back and fire up his machinery of creation again and whereas in the first time he used the logos that went across and created the heavens and the earth and brooded over the earth this time he's going to use the extension of the logos which is he was the beginning of the creation of God you're the continuation of that and now you're gonna take the machinery of creation into you and you're gonna rebuild the Millennial world Oh hallelujah no wonder this word was able to save you from your sin and make you a new creation in Christ Jesus he said I make he's going to can do it you can't do it to yourself he says I make all things new that's a very broad statement Paul saying saying here behold all things are become new old things I love it let me read it in its entirety again therefore if any man be in Christ are you in Christ he is a how'd you get into Christ by accepting his word for the hour that's how everybody that ever got in him got in him they accepted his word for the hour that was Peters message to the Jews you you didn't believe it and so I'm telling you now you better repent of that and believe it and if you believe it you can be saved hallelujah but you're gonna have to save yourselves how do I save myself by believing it and then and by accepting its lordship in the into your heart therefore if any man be in Christ he is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become new I've never heard a commentary on that verse that surpasses the one that our own brother Jason DeMars made here and he says he's talks about how that when you're a new creature and old things are passed away and all things are become new and he said freedom this freedom that this gives freedom in the new birth is is having your will transformed by the power of God so that you desire to live the way God designed human beings to live Wow he said that probably months ago I wrote it down put it in mine in my Bible I love that statement that's real freedom people oftentimes you find them abandoning the word and running from the word that God has sent to this hour well you run away from freedom when you do and what's ironic is the devil gives them and sells them the lie and they purchase it that they're getting away from the truth so they can get to freedom and it's the exact opposite of that you run away from God's Word you run into bondage the only form of freedom is having your will transformed by the power of God so that you desire to live the way God designed human beings to live amen brother JD Wow that was epic brother and God did it that's a big point it's two word it's three words God did it but that's some of the three most profound words you'll hear in this entire sermon I'm here to tell you God did it I couldn't do it for you you couldn't do it for you God did it and then God put me into this God revealed himself to me how am I gonna knock myself out I couldn't get myself in oh my hallelujah I'm signed and I'm sealed signed in the blood of Christ sealed in the Holy Ghost I love how that when God does things I said made this statement briefly in the Sunday School class he didn't need anyone's permission to save me he didn't need anyone's permission to save you he didn't need anyone's permission to send a prophet he didn't need anyone's approval on that he didn't even need anyone's agreement he doesn't need the devil to agree with him that I got to be saved the devil would never agree to let me be saved and because I had a mind as Paul said that I was born with when I was born in sin that was enmity against God and could never but never agree with God even I couldn't agree to be saved and the proof is I went for years not say but oh my somebody who loved me more than I loved me chase me down knocked me down rolled me over and pick me up and I became a new creation in Christ so when you when you abandon that mercy of God the word revealed in any age is his mercy when you run away from that you run away from freedom if you're a if you're a minister and some have been and they abandoned the word of the hour you ain't you invalidate your calling as soon as you do that you know that's my message to them you invalidate your calling you would literally void your commission because the Commission was going to all the world and preach the gospel that's the Commission you have no other authority if you're not doing that God does not backup men who run after their own desires he only backs up his word he has one provided way and you either come the way of His Word or you don't come see so it's it's nothing to fool around with because there's no coming back from that when you do that and that's that's sad to me that's very sad you know to abandon his word to become a disbeliever of something that God and you you you you trample it underfoot the blood of the Covenant Paul said and as is as if you're calling it an unholy thing and there's no coming back from from abandoning God's Word I'm you know what I'm gonna take some friends I'm very glad that personal failures don't do that to me I'm glad of that I'm glad that my personal failures won't keep me out and I got a bunch of them so I thought you were made new I am that's why I hate them I used to love them now I don't love them and when I used to do them I never repented now when I make a mistake I repent quickly because why I've had my desires changed that is how powerful faith in the revealed is in the eyes of God when you believe his word ah his word of your hour when you accept as I said earlier when you accept his lordship you can't just believe it the devil believes it's true but you've got to accept the words lordship in your heart when you do that friends then all external areas of your life are covered in the blood of Christ think about that so powerful such a thing that it is with God that when you open your heart and surrender all of your heart to Christ and he comes in and you allow him to be the lord of your heart and take up his rightful position and your throne the blood of Jesus covers all your external life going forward forever and there because you have passed from death to life Paul could say now there is no therefore no condemnation to who - them who are in Christ Jesus this is why he could faithfully promise all things would be new because he he was aware he believed he understood his own ability to redeem his family that there was no power that could keep his family from him and therefore he could say to his family even though you're going to continue in a fallen body even though you're still gonna be tempted even though you're still gonna stumble and you're gonna make mistakes I'm gonna I'm gonna change your heart and I know it won't be your desire and when you make those mistakes I'm gonna cover you in the blood I know you'll repent you know I'll forgive you and you're still gonna be my child and I'm never going to lose you I'm gonna taste something friends that's a beautiful promise that's a wonderful thing that is what his Millennium if you think about the millennial reign of Christ for the earth and we just talk naturally for a minute now that's the spirit side of your new birth but you know what one will his millennial reign be able to accomplish if you think about the plight of mankind from the book of Genesis not having accepted mankind having accepted knowledge from the tree of knowledge over God's wisdom in his word mankind has ruined himself and he not only has ruined himself as brother Branham would say it put every graveyard that's ever been in the earth that fateful decision that fateful decision that they made to choose knowledge from the tree of knowledge of good and evil over the Tree of Life which was full of God's wisdom that faithful decision that they made it was fatal to humanity and it was fatal to the world it put every tombstone it caused every siren that you hear every gunshot every war every time a soldier screamed in agony as he bled out on a battlefield that's what caused it mankind has ruined himself and he's also ruined in the world we live in we live in a world that is immersed in a we and we are immersed in it friends this is why church and fellowship and reading your Bible and praying and hearing the hearing the word in hearing live ministry and hearing archived and every piece of word hearing the tapes every piece of word that you can get your hands on feed on at night and day let it you say I have such a hard time for the Jason because I am my flesh has this appetite and I feed on too many things in the world push it out by increasing your reading of this just push it out push it out of your schedule by doing things that are spiritual push it out of your schedule see because I can tell you your flesh will always be tempted by those kinds of things and you'll always make allowances for yourself to say oh it's not too bad you know my goodness it's not gonna hurt me that bad but it does it has a corrosive effect and so I have found in my own personal experiences can you imagine I have weaknesses would you ever think it so you know what I what I do I realize this old flesh stealin converted so when I when I see too many things over the world occupying too much of my time and I'm not even talking about sinful things I'm just talking about things that have no benefit to my spirituality and maybe even have a tinge of corrosiveness too much virtuality come on let's be honest today come on friends 21st century we live in this stuff it's a soup we swim around in and what I have found successfully say brother Jason give me a tool that can help me be an overcomer increase your time in your Bible increase your time in the tapes increase your time in church increase your time in prayer increase your time in fellowship push out those things give the Bible says give no place for it I know let's give no time for it see because we are today immersed in a culture that is contrary to biblical values do you believe that contrary to biblical absolutes they're all gone they're all gone I heard Ravi Zacharias preaching on that recently said they're all gone it was it struck me to hear an evangelical that aware and as believers we're we're there we're to that we find that that that all definitions and absolutes have gone relativism has won the day relativism all absolutes are gone you know relativism is is somebody you say well I believe this is right and the relativism says well that's right for you that doesn't make it right for me and just because I don't do that doesn't mean I'm wrong relativism says whatever I think is right is right and you can and it doesn't matter you can read it out of God's Word but even the Bible absolutes even Bible morals Bible scruples there even the Bible itself it's now relative well that's your interpretation of it and I say I I don't want your interpretation or my interpretation God interprets his own word by bringing it to pass I'm not telling you that I learned a doctrine I'm telling you that I found a being who lives and he's alive and he lives in people who I know who I mingle with and fellowship with and I know what a power of God in my life has brought life into my life so it's right for you but it but you know it's it's not incumbent upon others Zacharias said this Ravi Zacharias he said all we hear today and I thought how poignant I wonder if he really knows why that is I don't think he was kept connecting the dot that Laodicea means people's rights and that's why you see that today and he made this statement all we hear today is rights rights rights very seldom do we hear of what is right cause a powerful statement all we hear is rights rights rights very seldom do we hear of what is right I'm here to take some friends in the Millenium he's going to take everything that knowledge / wisdom destroyed and he's going to return it back to its original condition and the beautiful part is is that he's restoring the original and that includes you that includes me we're all here today every one of us you don't even have to be very old to have regrets in the back of your mind and then the older you are depending on how you're raised in the life you lived and maybe when it went sideways early maybe had poor raising maybe had false teaching I don't know but we've all got I didn't have any of that stuff and yet I got a ton of things I regret I had good raising raised on the word from the day I was born but yet even I stand here today and I think if I could just go back to that if I could just go back to that I'd change that I'd redo that I would have done it like that I'm here to tell you God is restoring the original say what was my original state how I was in his mind so how were you in his mind as the same as him I was as perfect as God was and today he's bringing an end to this Eden compromise he's restoring the original in the in the analogy of the hidden manna that you can read about in the book of Revelation and I'll give you a hit man and a white stone and in the stone a new name written that no man knoweth save he that it's - and this hidden man of course had an application in that in that middle age where it's recorded in the book of Revelation but but we have found in the opening of the word of this hour that it has a future revelation where God is he said someday he and that word will become what you never dreamed possible so we find in the Millennium when he talks about restoring thanks to its original condition he's going to take you he's going to take his word and he's going to take the world to Heights that have never before been imagined it's still his world you know don't let don't let the world get to get you believing that they own it or that they're in control of it they are neither neither one of those things are true this is still his world he built it he owns he baptized it in Noah's day it didn't matter all the unbelief and they have the antediluvian world it still got its baptism Enoch still within a rapture hallelujah Noah still got saved by going into an ark he he he poured his blood down the cross and his blood went down and saturated the ground and he cleaned the earth I'm here to tell you he's going to give it a fiery baptism and he's going to make all things new again hallelujah that's how I got you water blood and spirit that's how a baby comes in water breaks blood breaks life comes hallelujah justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost glory to God hallelujah that's what we're a part of today you're part of the grand restoration and I'm here to tell you you can't stop it the world can't stop it nobody can stop it hallelujah he's gonna do it he's gonna take this world he's gonna take his word and he's gonna take you and lift you to Heights you've never imagined you could be add he's restoring the original in the original I won't have any regrets hallelujah and the original I won't have anything to be sorry for in the original oh my brothers sister who could not want a word in this hour that gives us back our original condition we told you last Sunday that Christ has started a he's a counter revolutionary counter revolutionaries that world thinks they're counter revolutionaries they don't clue counter revolutionary is engaged in or promoting a revolution that opposes a previous one or reverses its results we are emissaries of an approaching revolution it has nothing to do with the political revolutions that are going on right now it has nothing to do in politics it's it's it's to the point of civil war in social relations and race relations it's almost to the point of civil war I'm here to taste something friends when God builds this earth back again not none of that stuff's gonna exist hallelujah you talking about a counter-revolution it's not gonna be built by a mixed multitude it's not gonna be gods Jesus isn't gonna govern by identity politics he but but God but it's going to be governed by God who knows my true identity hallelujah who knows that I like Christ I started in God oh my to understand that you you you you didn't just win the lottery it's not about that you wasn't picking and choosing in election is origin I came from God I go back to God hallelujah God knows our true identity a new world a new world is coming friends hold on you hold on you just keep pressing a new world's coming don't be discouraged children a new world's coming I know it's rough right now I know the world's upside down I know it's chaos everywhere there's no way to fix it no way to fix it you you you you can't help one side without helping the other the whole problem is mankind is in a fallen condition and the only way to fix it is to give him a new condition hallelujah that's where true equity is that's where true freedom is that's our message to the world my message isn't to the world - to be a to be a Republican or a Democrat or a libertarian or an independent or whatever that's not my message to the world that's man's wisdom it's it's proved it's nothing but folly you can't legislate righteousness it's impossible for every righteous law you build you'd need 19 more to cover the loopholes that people take you you you try to help one side you harm the other you get it out of balance they've been trying this for 6,000 years people mankind history great dynasties and great cultures and great civilizations and emperors and monarchs and leaders and and and even tyrants dictators military genius philosophic genius political genius have never been able to come up with a form of government that is fair and equitable to all only Christ can do that hallelujah thank God I'm headed for a new world a new world

BAM he's a such beautiful language little baby Jehovah blows my baby Jehovah laying in a manger baby Jehovah crying baby Jehovah being picked up in a mother's arms and comforted and swaddled this is what God did god so loved the world as he said - as Abraham said to Isaac father behold the the fire behold the wood but where's the sacrifice and Abraham said the Lord shall provide himself a sacrifice oh my it describes the scene I love this this part in the song almost brings me to tears every time I hear it and I'd say if we're gonna can't sing he says angels in heaven silently watched over Earth adoring the sight of the one who had given them birth creation longed to sing back to him the song he had given them Oh Nature has been bound and steeped in the sin of the eat and compromise men's hearts have been bound in fear and dread this world is what this world that grace is gonna do I'm here to tell you it's gonna reverse that compromise and all nature will explode and praise is all for he who sits on the throne and John said all heaven and earth heard me shouting hallelujah amen oh my John represent of the bride don't forget in the book of Revelation and

friends comes down to this I say I want to serve Him now I want to serve him now so I count for something then I want to show up there well Jack but I stood for him here is that a great desire of your heart think about it friends from fear and worry to glory and beauty who wants that deal I got a deal I'm gonna make you an offer you can't refuse you get to lay down all your fear and worry and pick up all glory and beauty Oh hallelujah oh my do you know do you know there there's even there the world has gone into such craziness and that's how you can tell it's being driven by an evil spirit because it does things that don't even make sense doesn't even make sense and you know there's even a movement and I I didn't know this I go I I think I made this statement in several Sundays ago about that song that John Lennon wrote and he talks about you know it called imagine and any talk any and I don't know that I've ever heard the song all the way through but I was looking at the lyrics because I've heard pieces of it over the years but I know it's message and and its message was to was to say imagine there's no heaven it's easy if you try no hell below us above us only sky imagine all the people living for today just living for today with no thought of tomorrow now in concept that's what heaven will be you won't have to worry about it tomorrow because there won't be a tomorrow do you understand that mankind being made in the image of God is longs for this kind of existence do you know that's why they MIT built the Tower of Babel because they knew that they had fallen from something they knew they were dying it wasn't right something something's not right we didn't the world didn't start this way what's the answer listen I say we build a tower and break into heaven and get get something back that was taken from us and it would have worked because they caught a revelation of unity and they were of one mind and they were of one Accord and they had the same diet the same speech in the same language it meant that they spoke the same dialect and it also meant that they were one in mind and heart see now that's that's how God operates his family they were all in the upper room and they were in one mind and one Accord and suddenly there came a man and and brother Ram talks about if the family of God can ever to Saul get together he said the rapture will go so that's that's God's secret to God's power is oneness unity faith universal faith in God's Word by the whole family and here God comes down and begins to examine it and he begins to catch and see what's going on and he says now this was God saying not a man is God now this they've begun to do and now nothing can be restrained from them even whatsoever they would imagine and so God kind of used the devil's trick on him and he confounded him with confusion the devil does that so the devil is trying to use God's tools - God has used his and wrecked it again wrecked the whole thing and they left off building they couldn't even communicate anymore in this and it spread him out across the whole world because that's what they were supposed to do see building that tower was contrary to the Word of God when they came out of the flood God's command was now spread spread through the earth and and the Genesis principles back into play multiply and cover the earth repopulate everything and that's what the Commission was given to Noah and his sons to do and now here these people are saying no no no we're all stronger together there's safety in numbers we're going to all assemble in the valley of Shinar and we're gonna build a church in the tower we're gonna have a worship we're gonna you were gonna do what Cain did see it's always contrary to God's Word and and so so so you know there's and and I was I was saying to myself you know what a what an erroneous position for a superstar rock star you know to be one of the what do they call that the four lads that shook the world and to say imagine there's no heaven it's easy if do you know that they're that couple of weeks later all right there is it there's actually a movement - they're trying to change everything so much they actually want to change our national anthem and they said let's change it from the star-spangled banner' to imagine by John Lennon it's not a joke that's for real there's actually a movement trying to get that done and I thought to myself it doesn't surprise me because the world chose the Beatles over Jesus and the Beatles bragged about it we're more popular than Jesus Christ and it wasn't a false statement they were brother bond talked about that in the 50s he said nearly every kid can tell you who Davy Crocket was in the 1950s he said probably not a tenth of them could tell you who Jesus Christ is we saw that you remember the testimony that brother William Smith brother Dale's brother right up here at our own Hospital y'all ever hear that brother William was there when he's lived here and he's in the hospital and I forget now why he was in the ER and he's sitting there waiting to be seen and here's a man and a woman with a little girls about she's about probably eight maybe nine years old said cute little girl and he said Williams said he said I could tell she was very sick she just looked flushed and didn't like she didn't feel good and the mom and dad were sitting there I said I could tell they they weren't Christians and he said I thought well you know I'm a minister let me see if I can encourage them at least and so he he just said do you mind if I I'm a minister do you mind if I talk to her sure yeah go ahead and he said you know honey you okay and she said I don't feel good and I said well you know and he began to witness to her said you know Jesus can heal you you know and in the Word of God by His stripes you can be healed and and you could believe it right now and I've seen many little girls just like you that jesus healed and he said would you like for Jesus to heal you and that little girl in perfect innocence looked at him and said who's Jesus and he said it's so shocked him and the mom and dad just dropped their head and stared at the floor and here she says who's Jesus she had never even heard the name he's in a hospital with a strange the illness and she still doesn't even know his name I'm gonna take some friends the world long ago chose they chose the Beatles over Jesus they chose they chose doctrine of John Lennon because songs are sermon set to music they chose the doctrine of John Lennon they chose the doctrine of Paul McCartney over the doctrine of Jesus Christ you know I got one thing to say and I don't mean to speak evil over the dead but I just feel like saying out loud you were wrong John Lennon there is a heaven above and I'm sure you're a believer of that now there is a hell bleeped below and I'm quite positive you don't still believe what you wrote that what you were imagining was nonsense there is a heaven to live for and there is a hell to be avoided and it does matter what you do and think and say you can't just live for today I'm here to tell you I don't live for this day at all my whole day is this how can I serve God like Paul for me to live is Christ and to die is gain and I have said to you years and years and years I've said it and I'll say it again you've heard it for the umpteenth time this life is not about this life this life is about the next one coming this is only a proving grounds this is only a training field this is only getting you ready and you're here to try to find God's family your you're an ambassador you're a counter-revolutionary you're here to to upend the effects of a previous resin Treva a revolution that didn't set everybody free there is a heaven and I plan to go there and I say even so Lord Jesus come quickly let me close with these last few thoughts you know I was thinking about this the other day and I just stuck it in these notes in case I get to it and felt like saying and I do we all want to make heaven our home we're believers of the word we appreciate God we we have a desire for even the very things I'm preaching on today we desire world like that I desire my life to look like that too I want my life to look like the millennium so that when I go there I fit right in but you know friends there's always something to distract us you ever noticed that we you have to understand that this is Satan's tactic especially he's making vital use of our 21st century there's always there's never been an age where there's so many so much I sit like this there's so much stuff to distract you sometimes you know you need to need to get rid of some stuff say like what I don't know stuff figure it out whatever is distracting you there's always something to laugh at always something to research always some news to catch up on always something to respond to but when do we visit that little room that that pillar fire said to a prophet I'll meet you in there it's always something to distract us there's always something funny to look at some news to catch up something you know somebody said something I need to respond to that I'm take friends that's gonna go until we get out of here but there's also a little room there's a little room to visit you say yeah brother Jason where in the world is it well I I can't tell you where yours is but you better find it I'm here I'll tell you I found mine and I'm trying to spend a lot more time there say because you know what I found its Christ that little room was your heart it was your heart and I hope you know the weight of your heart today I hope Satan hasn't put so much debris over the trail that leads to your heart that you can't get there anymore friends let go of Laodicea and clear your mind of its poisons and get down into your heart and find the way where the Shekinah Lou that's what we need in this hour let the sacred love I've been preaching about the final voice at the end time before I came to this series on the end of the Eden compromise we talked about how that our lives that the world would need to hear from God once more brother Branham said once more the world will hear direct from God as they did at Pentecost so let this sacred love prevail the love of God and the love of his word let that prevail in all your chaste conversation that's your lifestyle live I'm saying like this live the love of God live your life as a manifestation of the love of God embrace a sacred recognition of who you are why you're here that should that that should inform your decisions if you can realize what God why he put you here and what he's done for you and the purpose of putting you here and doing that for you I'm gonna tell you something friends that you go out in your life and you you you you you live the correct way not because it's not because it's politically correct but because it's something sacred I'm going to tell you I want to say to a world who's lost all absolutes I still have an absolute I still know an absolute he lives inside me and I'm not I don't believe in relativism it's a everything's relative it's not everything is not really everything is absolute God's Word is absolute and I want to live a life that's correct not because it's because of political pressure social pressure racial pressure it's it's not moral works in view here it's the love of God it's not about do's and don'ts it's not laundry list it's not checkboxes it's my whole life is a conversation of the love of God and everywhere I go I emanate the love of God and all my conversation all my chaste conversation I live my life becomes a portrait of the love of God let's stand I want my whole life to bear a sacred recognition not because of social pressure but because it's sacred has nothing to do with popularity it's sacred this is a sacred trust you're gonna swim upstream the world's never going to go along with it but it's sacred see don't don't acquiesce to this world don't don't get into the stream of this is right and this is right there's nothing right but this say well this is a good person there's nobody good but him none not one I'm here to tell you you can't put your confidence in any man there's only one man and that's Christ Jesus hallelujah and there was a time when Paul said there was a time when we knew him after the flesh but after the flesh we don't know him that way anymore in other words were not just we're not just worshiping history that man who lived in the flesh now lives in me this is how I know him now I'm not caught back there in a history lesson the whole world is caught back there in a history lesson of his humanity I'm here to tell you he's still in humanity and you're looking at it turn around and look at your neighbor you're looking at the humanity of Christ because he put his humanity in you by his word come musicians a man I don't think I think but the map probably had to get out for his service to Arizona so we'll sing Amen if I've got any singing voice left there you go sister praise the Lord didn't got good eye I love him and I I think that if I'm gonna you know end this this series on the eden compromise you know what brings it to an end the love of God the love of God in your life ends the effects of the Eden compromise I want to tell you today embrace something new let go of the Eden compromise don't compromise God's Word because you are you are more qualified now that you're living at the end of a 6,000 year trial you know they have these medical trials and a lot more years they can put on it the more press more prestigious it is well yeah well that's that's right I see that report but it's only a two-year trial with limited people okay well that's a better one that's that's a trial that Mayo did and that's a 10-year trial and they use more people yeah like that Wow over here's the end of a twenty year trial and they used a couple thousand that's even better well I'm here to tell you you're at the end of a trial that's been going on for six thousand years and involved all of humanity that's ever lived no age has ever been able to say qualitatively like you can say the eden compromise was a terrible idea it was a horrible idea whoever thought that up we need to never do that again let's turn back to the word of god which should have been the choice in the first place we're going to a world where that choice has been made sister Dorothy I want to sing that old song the love of God amen see if you can find the
