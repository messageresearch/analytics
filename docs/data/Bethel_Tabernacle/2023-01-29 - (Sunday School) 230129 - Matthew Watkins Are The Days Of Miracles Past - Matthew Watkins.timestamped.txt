[0:00] a lot of this the adult Sunday school
[0:02] class was for was a good chance an
[0:04] opportunity to witness to our community
[0:07] to bring in friends or loved ones maybe
[0:10] that have never heard the message and so
[0:14] we we use it as a platform to be able
[0:16] just to teach straight from the Bible
[0:18] and from the message but to just to
[0:20] cover fundamental truths so for anyone
[0:22] streaming or watching we have a title
[0:24] today and our title is is the days of
[0:28] Miracles past that's our title so
[0:31] obviously I don't believe there's anyone
[0:33] in this audience who would say yes
[0:37] all of us would say no they aren't but
[0:39] we just want to establish something
[0:41] foundationally and I encourage you use
[0:44] this Sunday school as an opportunity to
[0:46] bring your friends or family or share an
[0:49] archive or a video of this I believe it
[0:51] could be a great blessing Mark chapter
[0:53] 16 what is three two verses here verse
[0:56] 17 and verse 18 and then we have some
[0:59] slides we want to get to
[1:01] and these signs verse 17 and Mark 16 and
[1:05] these signs shall follow them that
[1:08] belief in my name
[1:10] shall they cast out Devils they shall
[1:13] speak with new tongues they shall take
[1:16] up serpents and if they drink any deadly
[1:19] thing it shall not hurt them they shall
[1:22] lay hands on the sick and they shall
[1:26] recover you can be seated this morning I
[1:29] want to go straight to our slides and
[1:30] just bring something up that the prophet
[1:33] speaks about here and we're going to
[1:34] have just a lot of slides we look at
[1:36] today as we just lay a foundation for
[1:38] this
[1:39] this topic here today listen to what
[1:42] brother Branham says in the identified
[1:44] Christ of all ages he says so many
[1:48] people have different opinions of Christ
[1:50] as I travel in different parts of the
[1:53] country and around the world I find that
[1:55] so many people have their different
[1:57] opinions boy isn't that the truth today
[2:00] you'd be surprised to know what some of
[2:02] their opinions are some of them thinks
[2:05] that he's just a wonderful teacher
[2:06] remember this is the opinion of Jesus
[2:09] and brother random says some of them
[2:11] think that he's just a wonderful teacher
[2:13] well now he was he was that that's just
[2:18] exactly and many thinks that he was a
[2:21] great philosopher uh I might have went
[2:25] too far I apologize I did so let's read
[2:27] it again there at the end he says many
[2:29] people have different opinions he says
[2:31] some thinks he was a teacher he was that
[2:33] and many thinks that he was a great
[2:36] philosopher which he was that
[2:39] he certainly
[2:41] he was and then some of them think that
[2:44] he was a good man
[2:46] he was that but see he was more than
[2:49] that
[2:50] he was all of that
[2:54] plus
[2:55] that's an important comma and a word
[2:58] after he was all of that plus
[3:01] some of them think that he was a prophet
[3:04] he was a prophet but he was more than a
[3:07] prophet he was what the prophets was
[3:11] Plus
[3:13] see brother Brandon says so what how
[3:16] would we know now if he was teaching of
[3:19] his if he was teaching of his teachings
[3:21] he was a teacher and he was a great
[3:24] philosopher but the only way that we'll
[3:28] ever know today if we wanted to identify
[3:31] him today and I believe that he raised
[3:35] from the dead I believe that with all of
[3:37] my heart and I believe that he's
[3:40] promised here that he's the same
[3:42] yesterday today and forever and I am
[3:47] with thee always and I'll never leave
[3:49] thee nor forsake thee
[3:53] now those words listen to this now those
[3:56] words are they're either true or they're
[4:00] not true
[4:01] now this is a question that many in as
[4:05] brother Brandon says many have an
[4:06] opinion of who Jesus is
[4:09] so if you have an opinion of who Jesus
[4:11] is then when the scripture conflicts
[4:13] that opinion you have a choice
[4:16] you could either humble yourself to what
[4:18] the Bible says
[4:19] or you can explain it away
[4:22] now we're taking our topic here and the
[4:24] title is is the days of Miracles past
[4:27] the reason why we title that is that
[4:30] you'll find that here in our in what in
[4:33] our in our circles here you won't find
[4:34] that I don't believe there's any message
[4:37] believer uh who would ever even come
[4:39] close uh to to say and no to that answer
[4:43] of course we believe that Jesus is the
[4:45] same yesterday today and forever but in
[4:48] the religious world in the
[4:49] denominational and the
[4:50] non-denominational world the Evangelical
[4:53] World in fact all of the Protestant
[4:54] world you're going to have people who
[4:57] fall on different spots or different
[4:59] places on this question
[5:02] especially when you refer to Mark 16 and
[5:05] you refer to Miracles and the days of
[5:06] Miracles because logically
[5:09] in the human mind Miracles don't make
[5:11] sense logically to the brain to the mind
[5:14] right
[5:15] philosophically or in your in your
[5:18] rationale something that seems
[5:20] impossible yet we have at this church
[5:22] and churches around the world have
[5:24] recently and throughout history watched
[5:27] the supernatural take place and miracles
[5:29] take place Time and Time and Time and
[5:31] Time and Time Again
[5:33] and so but this this answer is brother
[5:36] Brandon says the different opinions that
[5:38] people have about Christ you'll always
[5:40] fall in this spot and you'll hear as
[5:43] brother Travis who's A brotherhood our
[5:46] church has testified when he was on a
[5:48] journey for the truth and he was he had
[5:50] read the god of the Bible he'd read the
[5:52] the book that brother Perry green wrote
[5:54] the acts of the Prophet but even before
[5:56] that he was reading the book of Acts
[5:58] he'd go to a youth leader and say
[6:00] where's this God uh you you're wonderful
[6:02] people you teach on the Lord Jesus but
[6:05] where's this God where's men that are
[6:07] filled with the baptism of the Holy
[6:09] Ghost
[6:10] it doesn't make sense that the Deacon is
[6:12] in church and then he takes a smoke
[6:14] break during church to go smoke a
[6:15] cigarette or they have a little social
[6:18] drink and and so to any normal person
[6:21] who hasn't been indoctrinated with
[6:23] religion something is not adding up here
[6:27] you're good people you love the Lord but
[6:29] and so Travis would get the same answer
[6:31] no matter where he went whether it was a
[6:33] pastor of of the of the large large
[6:36] church here in Beaufort to get the same
[6:38] exact question in fact the pastor of the
[6:40] largest church here in Beaufort told him
[6:42] Travis the days of the Apostles are over
[6:45] and the days of Miracles are over
[6:48] and that that's a Dallas Theological
[6:51] Seminary trained mind
[6:53] um and so listen to what brother Branham
[6:55] says here and that I think I want to key
[6:57] in on this statement brother Brandon
[6:59] says now those words what words he just
[7:01] read them I'm with thee always he's the
[7:03] same yesterday today and forever listen
[7:04] to what the prophet says here now those
[7:06] words they're either true or they're not
[7:09] true and if they're not true then what
[7:11] are we doing here tonight
[7:13] we're wretched people we're people
[7:15] that's well we're deceived the whole
[7:18] Christian world is deceived if he isn't
[7:21] the same yesterday today and forever if
[7:25] he isn't alive tonight and with us as he
[7:28] promised
[7:30] lo I Am With You Always even to the
[7:34] consummation that's the words of Jesus
[7:36] that the prophet is quoting here or the
[7:39] end of the world I'm with you always
[7:42] either that's true or it's not
[7:47] now if that isn't the truth then there's
[7:50] something wrong we are found false
[7:52] Witnesses not only are we making
[7:54] ourselves miserable
[7:56] under a false pretense but we are
[7:58] deceiving others we are found deceivers
[8:01] of something we're talking about which
[8:04] isn't if he's just a myth or just a
[8:07] historical what good is a historical
[8:12] Christ if he isn't the same today
[8:17] now what brother random was saying here
[8:19] is what good is good Bible teaching we
[8:21] could teach and we can teach and we can
[8:23] teach and we can learn and we can learn
[8:26] we can learn the original manuscripts
[8:28] and the languages and contextual things
[8:31] but what good is any of that if the
[8:34] author who wrote that isn't still alive
[8:37] today
[8:40] brother random says what good does it do
[8:42] to take your canary bird and feed him
[8:45] vitamins to make him pretty feathers
[8:48] good strong wings and then keep him in a
[8:52] cage
[8:56] now come on somebody this is this comes
[8:58] right down the home to us
[9:00] what good does it do all the teaching
[9:02] and all the preaching and all of the
[9:04] church entity if we just cage up that
[9:06] power in a cage somewhere brother
[9:09] Branham says what good is what good is a
[9:12] historical Christ
[9:13] if he isn't the same today what good is
[9:18] a god of Moses if he isn't the same God
[9:21] today what good does it do to take your
[9:24] canary bird feeding vitamins to make him
[9:26] pretty feathers good strong wings and
[9:27] then keep him in a cage see it doesn't
[9:30] do him any good and we talk about how
[9:33] great God was and then don't say he's
[9:36] the same today
[9:38] then there's something wrong we're caged
[9:41] up somewhere and that's a false
[9:44] conception of what God is
[9:47] so you have this line of thinking that
[9:50] comes into the church world to the
[9:52] religious world that there was a time
[9:55] that there was Apostolic gifts there was
[9:58] a time when there was Miracles we read
[10:00] about it in the book of Acts
[10:01] but the Bible says that God and sun dry
[10:04] times spoke to us through the prophets
[10:06] has now spoken to us through his son
[10:08] Jesus and so Jesus when he was on Earth
[10:11] he spoke everything that was to be said
[10:13] it's written down we follow the gospels
[10:16] we live life by the gospels and that's
[10:19] it there's no more solo scriptura is
[10:23] another uh uh you could call it a
[10:25] disposition or a belief of of nominal
[10:27] Evangelical churches here that means
[10:30] only in scripture and scripture alone
[10:32] and we would say to a degree of that
[10:35] amen
[10:37] but if he isn't the same today as he was
[10:40] then then what good is he we're wasting
[10:43] our times and making ourselves miserable
[10:45] for nothing
[10:46] and so so you have this idea that comes
[10:50] in and you'll find also the same exact
[10:53] scripture that to the the Paul said that
[10:56] though I speak with the tongues of men
[10:57] and angels though I have gifts though I
[10:59] have chair though I do all of these
[11:01] things give my body
[11:02] and yet I have not loved then all of
[11:05] that is is is is is pointless and mute
[11:08] and and worthless and so they take that
[11:10] to mean that see there all you need is
[11:13] love you don't need gifts you don't need
[11:14] you don't need Miracles you don't need
[11:16] any of these things and the Apostle Paul
[11:18] said that then that when that which is
[11:20] perfect has come then that which is in
[11:23] part shall be done away with and so they
[11:25] ex they take that scripture as to mean
[11:28] that now that Jesus has came then we
[11:33] don't need Miracles we don't need that
[11:35] the tongues we don't need gifts we don't
[11:38] need prophecy we don't need all of these
[11:40] gifts that Paul said in order in the
[11:42] book of Corinthians because we now have
[11:44] that which is perfect
[11:46] sadly there are some even in the message
[11:48] who would go as far as to say that we've
[11:51] received the perfect word and so now we
[11:53] don't need the apostolic gifts operated
[11:55] in the church
[11:56] so then I ask a question did the
[11:59] apostolic gifts end with the First with
[12:03] the end of the Bible I'll say it that
[12:05] way to simplify it did the apostolic
[12:09] gifts did Miracles end when the Bible
[12:13] was finished
[12:15] when the days of Peter was over when the
[12:18] days of Paul and John was over
[12:20] did the signs and wonders continue to
[12:23] accompany the first church hello let me
[12:26] keep your attention this is a critical
[12:27] Junction here you're going to be lost
[12:30] did the the gifts and the supernatural
[12:35] and the Miracles and the signs that
[12:37] Jesus said in Mark 16 these signs shall
[12:39] follow them that believe did they end
[12:42] with the death of the last Apostle well
[12:45] let's find out
[12:47] let's read some history this is
[12:50] 8155 to 160. Justin Martyr and this is
[12:55] in his dialogue with trifo I'm just
[12:58] going to read some of these are taken
[12:59] from quotations and I'm reading you
[13:01] these to show you just excerpts if you
[13:05] you couldn't go back we don't have a
[13:07] time machine to go back to Justin Martyr
[13:09] and and the ad155 so what do we have we
[13:12] have historical records that give you a
[13:15] sense
[13:16] or they give you an understanding of
[13:18] what did the church believe right are
[13:21] you with me you're following me listen
[13:23] to Justin Martyr for the prophetical
[13:25] gifts remain with us even to the present
[13:30] time
[13:33] so did they end with the last apostle
[13:35] Justin Martyr says for the prophetical
[13:37] gifts remain with us even to the present
[13:42] time this is his dialogue with trifo who
[13:44] is trying to suggest that the days of
[13:47] Miracles had ended with the apostles and
[13:49] he says the prophetical gifts remain
[13:51] with us
[13:52] listen here's ireneus irenaeus however
[13:55] you want to pronounce his name terti's
[13:57] messenger this is in the book against
[13:58] heresies Book 2 chapter 32. 81 this is
[14:02] 80 180. those this is so good I just
[14:05] wish I would if you want this PowerPoint
[14:07] you want to have it I can get it to you
[14:09] it's really good to study those who are
[14:11] in the truth his disciples receiving
[14:13] Grace from him do in his name perform
[14:18] Miracles so as to promote the welfare of
[14:22] other men according to the gift which
[14:25] each one has received from him for some
[14:28] do certainly and truly drive out Devils
[14:32] so they were still driving out devils in
[14:35] the days of irenius
[14:37] so that those who have thus been
[14:39] cleansed from evil spirits frequently
[14:41] both believing Christ and joined
[14:43] themselves to the church others have
[14:46] foreknowledge of things to come they see
[14:48] visions and utter prophetic Expressions
[14:51] others still heal the Sick by laying
[14:55] their hands upon them and they are made
[14:58] whole
[15:00] so what did irenius believe
[15:03] yay moreover
[15:05] listen to what he says here yea moreover
[15:07] as I have said the dead even have been
[15:10] raised up
[15:13] so again we'll come back to our question
[15:15] did the is the days of miracles did it
[15:18] end with the apostles Iranians didn't
[15:20] believe that
[15:21] Justin Martyr we found out didn't
[15:23] believe that
[15:24] notice he says and what share this is
[15:27] just as important I just want to stop
[15:28] here and say this is just as critical
[15:30] and important for me to bring you up
[15:32] historical teaching of water baptism
[15:34] we've done that here before and you
[15:36] could take pamphlets that we have in
[15:38] material to show you that after the
[15:41] apostolic after the days of the Apostles
[15:43] was over they still baptized in the name
[15:45] of Jesus Christ not titles
[15:48] but somewhere perversion
[15:51] misconstruing of scripture came in to
[15:53] give us the baptism in the name of the
[15:55] Father the Son and the Holy Ghost but
[15:56] the first church historically believed
[15:59] in baptism by Jesus name
[16:01] so this is just as important to show you
[16:03] this is what they believe the first
[16:05] church the early church listen he says
[16:08] and he says even the dead have been
[16:10] raised up and remained Among Us for many
[16:12] years
[16:14] and what shall I more say it is not
[16:16] possible to name the number of gifts
[16:19] which the church scattered through the
[16:21] whole world has received from God In The
[16:23] Name of Jesus Christ who was crucified
[16:25] under POTUS pilate in which she exerts
[16:28] day by day for the benefit of the
[16:30] Gentiles neither practicing deception
[16:32] upon any nor talk taking any reward from
[16:35] them on account of such miraculous inner
[16:37] positions for as she has received freely
[16:40] from God freely also does she minister
[16:43] to others for this reason let's get
[16:46] through irenius for this reason does the
[16:49] apostles declare we speak wisdom among
[16:53] them that are perfect
[16:55] determine those persons perfect who have
[16:59] received the spirit of God and who
[17:02] through the spirit of God do speak in
[17:05] all languages
[17:08] this is what iridius believed about
[17:11] those when Paul uses the term we speak
[17:14] among them that are perfect
[17:17] let's get some irenius's teaching
[17:20] terming those persons perfect who not
[17:22] just receive the spirit of God but speak
[17:25] in tongues
[17:27] as he used himself also to speak in like
[17:31] manner we do also hear many brethren in
[17:33] the church who possess prophetic gifts
[17:35] and who through the spirit speak all
[17:37] kinds of languages and bring to light
[17:39] for the general benefit the hidden
[17:41] things of men and declare the mysteries
[17:43] of God who also the apostles terms
[17:45] spiritual they be in spiritual because
[17:48] this is important they partake of the
[17:53] spirit
[17:55] they partake of the spirit what do we do
[17:58] in church
[17:59] we're partaking of the spirit
[18:03] they partake of the spirit here's
[18:05] tuturian 8208 let Martian this is his
[18:09] when he's challenging a heretic named
[18:11] marcion and marcion's Challenge and
[18:14] tuturian's challenges I want you to
[18:16] produce the same gifts and and visions
[18:19] and prophecies and interpretations and
[18:22] tongues as the Orthodox Church did this
[18:23] is his challenge to him let marcion then
[18:26] exhibit as gifts of his God some
[18:29] prophets such as have not spoken by
[18:31] human sense but with the spirit of God
[18:33] such as both predicted things to come
[18:35] and have made manifest the secrets of
[18:37] the heart
[18:38] for he quotes First Corinthians 14 25
[18:40] let him produce a Psalm a vision a
[18:43] prayer First Corinthians 14 26 only Let
[18:46] It Be by the spirit in an ecstasy that
[18:49] is in a Rapture whenever an
[18:52] interpretations of tongues has occurred
[18:54] to him let him show to me also that any
[18:56] woman of boastful tongue in his
[18:57] community has ever prophesied from among
[18:59] those specially holy sisters of his now
[19:02] all these signs of spiritual listen to
[19:04] tutorial all these signs all these signs
[19:08] somebody say all
[19:10] he says now all these signs of spiritual
[19:14] gifts and they agree too with the rules
[19:17] and the dispensations in the
[19:19] instructions of the Creator therefore
[19:20] without doubt that Christ and the spirit
[19:22] and the Apostle belongs severally
[19:24] I'm sorry I missed the important part
[19:26] there let me back up now all these signs
[19:28] of spiritual gifts gifts are forthcoming
[19:31] from my side without any difficulty
[19:37] this is a man speaking about the gift
[19:39] the gifts interpretation tongues
[19:41] prophecies and he says they come from
[19:43] our side without any difficulty listen
[19:46] it's going a little bit further this is
[19:48] origin and may not pronounce these names
[19:49] right forgive me of
[19:52] Alexandria this is 8248 we're moving
[19:55] time's going forward here we have to say
[19:58] moreover that the gospel has a
[20:00] demonstration of its own
[20:03] more Divine than any established by
[20:05] Grecian dialects and this diviner method
[20:10] is called by the Apostle the
[20:12] manifestation of the spirit and of power
[20:15] of the spirit on account of these
[20:17] prophecies which are sufficient to
[20:20] produce faith in Anyone who reads them
[20:22] especially in those things which relate
[20:25] to Christ and of power because of the
[20:27] signs and wonders which we must believe
[20:29] to have been performed both on many
[20:32] other grounds and on this that traces of
[20:35] them that are still preserved among
[20:37] those who regulate their lives by the
[20:39] precepts of the Gospel
[20:41] and the and there are still preserved
[20:44] among Christians traces of that Holy
[20:48] Spirit which can appear in the form of a
[20:51] dove
[20:52] they expel evil spirits and perform many
[20:55] cures and foresee certain events
[20:57] according to the will of the logos so
[21:00] where did it change
[21:03] this is not just the Bible now now we've
[21:05] moved past the Bible and we have the
[21:07] tracing
[21:09] of the Holy Spirit operating in his
[21:12] church throughout the first church
[21:15] listen we'll go a little bit further
[21:17] origin of Alexandra and in the name of
[21:20] Jesus how many believe this can still
[21:23] how many can say can still
[21:25] remove distractions from the minds of
[21:27] men expelled demons take away diseases
[21:30] produce marvelous meekness of spirit I
[21:33] love how he interjects that right there
[21:37] not just the gifts not just expelling
[21:39] the but Jesus can also produce marvelous
[21:42] meekness of spirit and complete change
[21:46] of character
[21:47] and a Humanity of goodness and
[21:50] gentleness and those individuals who do
[21:52] not feign themselves to be Christian and
[21:54] some give evidence and some give
[21:57] evidence of their having received
[21:59] through this Faith a marvelous Power by
[22:01] the cures which they perform revoking no
[22:04] other name over those who need their
[22:06] help than that of God of all than that
[22:08] of the God of all things and of Jesus
[22:09] along with the mention of his history
[22:11] for by these means we too have seen many
[22:14] persons freed from Grievous calamities
[22:16] and from distractions of mine and
[22:19] Madness and countless other ills which
[22:21] could be cured neither by men nor Devils
[22:23] let me just say it Jesus is still the
[22:26] great physician he's still the Healer
[22:31] God desired to commend the doctrine of
[22:33] Jesus as a Doctrine which was to save
[22:35] Mankind and which was based indeed upon
[22:39] the apostles as foundations of the
[22:41] rising edifice of Christianity but which
[22:44] increased in magnitude also in the
[22:46] succeeding ages in which not a few cures
[22:49] and that means not not just a couple are
[22:52] wrought in the name of Jesus in certain
[22:53] other manifestations of no small moment
[22:56] have taken place here's Martin this is
[22:59] another church age messenger you'll
[23:00] recognize the picture there here's
[23:02] Martin three times the dead I'm just
[23:04] going to quote to you this three times
[23:08] the dead were raised in the ministry of
[23:12] Saint Martin
[23:14] here's just one account I'm going to
[23:16] read you one account
[23:17] while Saint Martin was away traveling
[23:19] for three days the unbaptized catacomb
[23:22] came down with the high fever or catch
[23:25] human however you want to say that
[23:27] came down with the high fever don't get
[23:29] stuck on the words keep reading with me
[23:30] his body lay lifeless in one of the
[23:34] cells awaiting burial Martin stretched
[23:37] forth him stretched himself at full
[23:39] length of the Dead Limbs and his
[23:42] departing brother just like Elijah he
[23:44] laid his body on him
[23:45] and after he stayed lying there sometime
[23:48] in prayer and had become aware through
[23:50] the spirit that the power of God was
[23:52] present he rose up for a short time and
[23:55] fixing his Gaze on the Dead Man's face
[23:57] he waited with confidence for the result
[23:59] of his prayer and the mercy of the Lord
[24:01] and after scarcely two hours how many
[24:04] would have given up after 30 minutes
[24:06] after scarcely two hours had passed he
[24:10] saw the dead men begin to move all of
[24:12] his limbs little by little and his eyes
[24:14] trembling and blinking as he recovered
[24:17] sight
[24:19] was the god of the Bible still active in
[24:22] the Church of Martin
[24:25] here's Columba here's another church
[24:27] AIDS messenger Columbus remembered as a
[24:29] missionary and a miracle worker belows
[24:32] just an excerpt of the Miracles of
[24:34] Columbus life wherever Columbo went he
[24:37] shared his mystical insights and
[24:39] spiritual visions introduced by the
[24:41] introduced the good news of the Gospel
[24:43] to pagans and offered pastoral
[24:45] counseling according to Adam and he
[24:48] performed Miracles too Healing The Sick
[24:50] killing a boar of amazing size merely by
[24:54] commanding it to die Where You Are
[25:01] spoke to a boar a pig die where you are
[25:04] don't say that to anybody just to wild
[25:07] pigs
[25:10] drawing water from a stone this was
[25:12] Columba drawing water from a stone and
[25:15] tussling cigar the days of Miracles are
[25:17] passed brother Travis that the age ended
[25:19] with the apostles uh-uh
[25:22] this is tussling successfully with Pagan
[25:25] Wizards once the saint was accompanied
[25:27] by a bright column of fiery light like
[25:29] the pillar of Fire
[25:31] who else was accompanied by a great
[25:33] pillar of light
[25:37] he was a company this is not brother
[25:39] Brandon I'm not saying this I'm reading
[25:40] you straight out of History
[25:42] he was accompanied by a column of fiery
[25:45] light that sounds just like the picture
[25:46] that we have of God's Prophet with the
[25:48] pillar of fire appearing over his head
[25:51] that preceded the Israelites in the book
[25:53] of Exodus Exodus and if that wasn't
[25:55] protection enough he could call upon the
[25:57] support of Holy Angels if he could so
[26:00] could we
[26:01] here's Cyril I'm just got a few more
[26:03] Cyril of Jerusalem and though he's one
[26:05] in nature yet many are the virtues by
[26:07] which this is 8350. we're moving forward
[26:09] let's go past it getting closer to us
[26:11] why but it's the will of let me start
[26:13] over and though he is one in nature yet
[26:15] many are the virtues which by the will
[26:16] of God in the name of Jesus Christ he
[26:18] works for he employs the tongue of one
[26:21] man for wisdom the soul of another he
[26:23] enlightens by prophecy to another he
[26:25] gives power to drive away Devils to
[26:27] another he gives to interpret the Divine
[26:28] scriptures
[26:29] Augustine of Hippo
[26:32] this is notes from the city of God in
[26:34] 426 in his book city of God Augustine
[26:37] dedicates an entire chapter to the
[26:40] continuation of Miracles indignant at
[26:42] the suggestion that they ceased with the
[26:44] apostles so that Spirit was already
[26:46] working
[26:47] he claimed to have witnessed a number
[26:49] himself enlist an extraordinary range of
[26:51] healings from blindness rectal fistula
[26:54] breast cancer gout paralysis hernia
[26:56] demonization and even death
[27:01] I sometimes say if some of these
[27:04] historical men were to come in some
[27:05] Churches would they recognize that as
[27:07] even being a Christian Church
[27:11] you understand this is what identified a
[27:15] Christian Church not a man teaching
[27:17] buying a Pulpit and just reading the
[27:19] scroll and telling you the theology
[27:21] wasn't what identified a Christian
[27:22] Church what identified them was that
[27:25] Christ was among them
[27:29] here's my summary we have the witness of
[27:32] Justin irenius tatorian origin and
[27:35] Spruce I didn't even give you some of
[27:37] these
[27:38] um uh these I didn't read all of these
[27:41] basal Cyril Augustine we have a massive
[27:44] spread listen close we have a massive
[27:47] spread chronologically from the mid
[27:50] second century to the early 5th Century
[27:52] that shows a charismatic church of
[27:55] Visions tongues interpretation of
[27:58] tongues killings Miracles and
[28:01] geographically all the way from the Far
[28:03] East if I were to show you a map and I
[28:06] wanted to show you where these men were
[28:08] located it wasn't in one spot it was all
[28:10] across the globe
[28:12] we have the witness of all of these
[28:14] men's of Visions tongues interpretations
[28:17] geographically all the way from the East
[28:19] to the far west of the Empire and north
[28:20] and south of the Mediterranean brother
[28:23] Branham says in the sardisian church age
[28:24] two more quotes and we'll close now Paul
[28:27] had baptized in Jesus name and
[28:29] re-baptized where people had not been so
[28:31] immersed he set the church in order and
[28:34] taught the proper use of the gifts of
[28:36] the Spirit and confirmed that they were
[28:39] to remain in the church until Jesus came
[28:42] amen
[28:44] thus the next that was Paul
[28:47] thus the next Messengers we just read
[28:50] all about the next Messengers thus the
[28:53] next Messengers all the remaining six
[28:56] would be would by the same Holy Ghost
[29:00] burn with the same fire and give the
[29:04] same light of the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[29:06] and signs would follow them did irenius
[29:10] qualify
[29:13] say it
[29:16] yes
[29:18] did Martin
[29:19] did Columbus
[29:21] did Martin Luther most assuredly brother
[29:23] random says did Wesley yes sir he had a
[29:26] great ministry and even prayed for his
[29:28] horse to get well and it did there you
[29:30] are seven Church ages and seven
[29:32] Messengers who were alike and Paul
[29:34] pronounced a curse on anyone
[29:37] who said he was a messenger but had a
[29:40] different gospel and lived in a
[29:42] different light
[29:43] let's stand
[29:45] Lord we give you thanks for your word
[29:48] it burns down within us Lord
[29:51] father we're a church Lord who wants to
[29:54] be identified
[29:55] not Lord by some Creed or theory of man
[29:58] or doctrine or name or title but we want
[30:02] to be identified by the moving of your
[30:05] spirit that's alive today
[30:07] moving in word moving in fruits moving
[30:10] in gifts Let It Be Lord I pray God in
[30:14] Jesus name amen
