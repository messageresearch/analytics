[51:52] we pray and all the Believers says amen
[51:56] and amen if you have your Bibles this
[51:58] morning we want to go to the book of St
[52:00] Luke the 9th chapter the book of St Luke
[52:03] the ninth CH or the 19th Chapter rather
[52:06] St Luke chapter
[52:07] 19 we're going to read there and then we
[52:10] want to look in the book of 1 Peter
[52:12] chapter 2 amen you love the Lord this
[52:14] morning amen how many can Testify the
[52:17] Lord done something for you in that
[52:18] prayer line last night amen God bless
[52:21] you amen the labors are not in vain
[52:24] Brothers amen there's many hearts and
[52:26] lives touched amen St Luke chapter
[52:29] 19 and verse
[52:31] 41 the Bible here says and when he was
[52:35] come near he beheld the city and wept
[52:38] over it saying if thou had us known even
[52:44] thou at least in that in this thy day
[52:47] that the things which belong unto thy
[52:49] peace but now they are HID from thine
[52:53] eyes so there were things that could
[52:55] have been revealed and seen that would
[52:58] have brought peace but they were hid now
[53:00] from their eyes look at verse 43 for the
[53:03] day shall come upon thee that thine
[53:05] enemies shall cast a trench about thee
[53:08] and Compass thee round and keep thee in
[53:11] on every side and shall lay thee even
[53:14] with the lay thee even with the ground
[53:17] and thy children within thee and they
[53:19] shall not leave in thee one stone upon
[53:22] another that's a that's a pretty dark
[53:24] situation isn't it you you know why that
[53:27] was happening because they knewest not
[53:29] the time of thy visitation the Bible
[53:33] tells us in Revelation three that the
[53:35] age we're living in would be wretched
[53:37] miserable poor blind and naked and the
[53:40] Bible says and knoweth it not see but if
[53:44] thou had known the day of thy visitation
[53:47] in the book of uh first Peter the book
[53:50] of First Peter I want to look there in 1
[53:52] Peter chapter 2 and verse number 12 12 1
[53:57] Peter chapter 2 and verse number 12
[54:00] Peter here writing says having your
[54:02] conversation honest among the
[54:05] Gentiles that whereas they speak against
[54:08] you as
[54:09] evildoers they may be that they might
[54:12] they may by your good works which they
[54:15] shall behold now watch this glorify God
[54:19] in the day of visitation glorify God in
[54:23] the day of visitation we ask Lord that
[54:26] just morning to add the blessing to the
[54:27] reading of his word as you can have your
[54:28] seats here uh this morning I want you by
[54:31] the help of the Lord uh to read you a
[54:33] quote here and maybe just to draw our
[54:35] title and our thought out of this
[54:37] scripture uh or this the passages we've
[54:39] read this morning but from the sermon
[54:41] 1962 the uncertain sound brother BM says
[54:45] heavenly father he says I pray the
[54:47] prayer for them with all my heart he
[54:49] says I give them to you they're trophies
[54:52] of the message he says they're trophies
[54:54] of your visitation so I want to talk to
[54:57] you for just a few moments on the
[54:58] trophies amen of visitation they're
[55:01] trophies of your visitation being here
[55:04] tonight amen seeing you walk among us
[55:07] doing works that has never been done
[55:09] since the foundation of the world until
[55:11] these days he said here they are they
[55:14] are your children he says I commend them
[55:17] to you Lord you give them to us and we
[55:19] give them to you in the name of Jesus
[55:21] Christ watch over them and raise them up
[55:24] at the last day I may never be able to
[55:26] shake their hands on this Earth but when
[55:28] the battle is over and the last trumpet
[55:31] has sounded amen watch and the dead has
[55:34] raising from the grave the lives have
[55:36] been called up together with them to
[55:37] meet the Lord in the air then may I have
[55:40] fellowship with Jesus Christ and them
[55:43] around the throne and through the
[55:46] Eternal ages to come granted Lord they
[55:48] are yours in the name of Jesus Christ
[55:51] amen I say my what a prayer that a
[55:54] prophet prayed amen that there were
[55:56] going to be people who were going to be
[55:58] trophies of the message of the hour now
[56:01] when you look at that word visitation
[56:03] Webster says that it is a special amen
[56:06] dispensation of divine favor amen or
[56:10] wrath so when a visitation comes it will
[56:13] either bring favor amen or it will bring
[56:15] wrath now the Bible speaks of a
[56:17] visitation in the Book of Job chap 10:2
[56:21] he says Thou Hast granted me life and
[56:23] favor and thy visitation has preserved
[56:27] my spirit Psalms 102:13 David says Thou
[56:31] shalt arise and have mercy upon Zion for
[56:34] the time to favor her yay the set time
[56:38] is come now I'll say what a prophet said
[56:40] he said May the power reach down and
[56:43] pick up the people and shake them Lord
[56:46] and let them realize that this is the
[56:51] day time amen the Lord has said see this
[56:55] is the time of of their healing so man
[56:57] can set times and man does things
[57:00] according to the time that he sets amen
[57:02] and man can fail because he's finite
[57:04] he's a human amen but when God sets a
[57:07] time or when God SCH something his
[57:10] calendar amen there's nothing in time
[57:12] that can defeat what God Amen desires to
[57:16] do from eternity I'll say every
[57:18] generation amen is promised to receive a
[57:21] great visitation when that visitation
[57:24] comes among that generation it is the
[57:26] season or the time or the hour amen when
[57:29] the promises of God for that age amen
[57:32] begin to come to pass he said I thank
[57:35] thee tonight for the Holy Ghost and for
[57:37] the visitation of him right here Amen in
[57:40] this building and even right here now
[57:43] the very Spirit according to the word of
[57:45] God which is infallible and cannot fail
[57:49] he said the same spirit that raised
[57:52] Jesus from the grave is right here in
[57:54] our midst right now listen friends the

[58:22] time Amen to realize the seriousness
[58:26] amen of the visitation of God in this
[58:28] age it's the hour when the Gospel of
[58:31] Jesus Christ is being watered down it's

[59:59] shall be amen but we know that when he
[1:00:01] shall appear we shall be like him for we

[1:00:14] in the past amen that we were the sons
[1:00:17] of God or we were the daughters of God
[1:00:20] Amen but look at that word now it means
[1:00:22] at this time amen at the present amen at
[1:00:26] this very moment you are the sons of God
[1:00:30] let me say what a prophet said he said I
[1:00:32] did not come Amen to bring you a fear
[1:00:35] and scare he said I come to bring you
[1:00:37] away from the fear and scare that you're
[1:00:39] not going to be the sons of God Amen you
[1:00:42] always were the sons of God see now is
[1:00:45] the hour now is the time now is the
[1:00:48] accepted hour this is the acceptable
[1:00:50] year of the Lord now is when healing is
[1:00:52] supposed to be now is when Miracles take
[1:00:55] place now is when Christ is revealing
[1:00:58] himself here we are now not in the
[1:01:01] future the devil keeps pushing it off
[1:01:04] that's Catholicism he said now is the
[1:01:06] day this is the hour this is the time
[1:01:09] this is the place right now amen This Is
[1:01:12] The Day He said these things we are
[1:01:14] seeing today they could not happen 20
[1:01:17] years ago or 40 years ago he said it's
[1:01:20] today it happens amen because this is
[1:01:23] the hour this is the time he says now is
[1:01:27] the time it's fulfilled why because God
[1:01:31] promised it and here it is listen
[1:01:34] there's not no need for healing in the
[1:01:35] Millennium there's no need for salvation

[1:02:19] will not be people amen battling the
[1:02:21] facts of whether amen they are a son of
[1:02:24] God or not I believe there is is a place
[1:02:26] in Jesus Christ that a Believer can go
[1:02:29] so deep in God until there is a
[1:02:31] revelation amen that settles in the
[1:02:33] depths of their soul but let me say this
[1:02:36] your position amen does not change who
[1:02:39] you are if you're on the mountain you're
[1:02:42] a Son of God if you're in the valley
[1:02:44] you're a Son of God if you're sick
[1:02:46] you're a Son of God if you're well
[1:02:48] you're a Son of God if you're broke
[1:02:50] you're a Son of God if you're rich
[1:02:52] you're a Son of God listen if you got
[1:02:55] joy you're Son of God and if you're
[1:02:57] facing sadness you're a Son of God the
[1:02:59] devil does not determine who I am the
[1:03:02] word determines Who I Am the word has
[1:03:05] called me from before the foundation of
[1:03:09] the world listen I have not come here
[1:03:11] amen just as a church member we have
[1:03:13] come here as a Bible bride who is here
[1:03:16] to fulfill the promises of the children
[1:03:18] of God I want to draw from another
[1:03:20] prayer from the prophet he preaches the
[1:03:22] message the token 1963 at the end of
[1:03:25] that sermon he says and if there be a
[1:03:27] seed anywhere that's predestinated Lord
[1:03:30] to hear the word of this last day may
[1:03:34] they come now sweetly and
[1:03:37] humbly can I show you something he's not
[1:03:40] saying let them come hear the word and
[1:03:42] receive the seed he's saying they are
[1:03:45] the seed that's why they're coming to
[1:03:48] hear the word oh Church of the Living
[1:03:51] God you didn't come here this weekend to
[1:03:53] become the seed the reason you are here
[1:03:55] is because you have a seed in your soul
[1:03:58] it wasn't put there at the altar it
[1:04:00] wasn't put there at a prayer line it
[1:04:02] wasn't put there at a special meeting
[1:04:04] there was a seed that was put in your
[1:04:06] soul from before the foundation of the
[1:04:09] world and there ain't no devil can
[1:04:11] change it there ain't no Spirit can
[1:04:14] change it bad days can't change the fact
[1:04:16] that I come from the mind of God as a
[1:04:19] gene seed of God and I will return amen
[1:04:22] not as a jean seed but as a manifested
[1:04:25] attributes of what that seed was sent
[1:04:28] into this hze to
[1:04:30] manifest hey hey Hallelujah we didn't
[1:04:33] come here to become a seed we always
[1:04:35] were a seed he said they come here to
[1:04:37] hear the word of this last day he said
[1:04:40] may they come now sweetly and humbly
[1:04:43] watch this and lay their trophies down
[1:04:46] at the cross now watch a prophet turn a
[1:04:49] corner or their self as a trophy
[1:04:55] the grace of God that's called them and
[1:04:59] may they be filled with the Holy Spirit
[1:05:01] and display the token of the life of
[1:05:05] Jesus Christ in his resurrection as long
[1:05:09] as they remain here on Earth so this
[1:05:13] power that is coming into you by the
[1:05:16] word of the hour is actually causing you
[1:05:19] to display the grace of Jesus Christ let
[1:05:23] me just say this nobody has ever
[1:05:26] received a trophy but what they wanted
[1:05:28] to display
[1:05:30] it are you awake do you realize colleges
[1:05:34] have trophies but they're not out there
[1:05:36] in the back shop they have trophies and
[1:05:38] they're not over in a closet somewhere
[1:05:40] amen but those trophies are on display
[1:05:43] they're out in the front because
[1:05:45] somebody amen fought the Battle got the
[1:05:47] Victory and they want to see that there
[1:05:50] is a trophy of what we done look at this
[1:05:52] word trophy it is something gained or a
[1:05:55] achieved or given in Victory or Conquest
[1:05:59] it is especially when preserved or
[1:06:01] mounted as a memorial it is a
[1:06:04] representation of such a memorial as on
[1:06:07] a metal now this is the one I love
[1:06:09] brother Jason it's a game animal or fish
[1:06:13] amen it's a game animal or fish that is
[1:06:16] suitable for mounting as a trophy it is
[1:06:19] usually used attributively can I tell
[1:06:22] you what a prophet said about you he
[1:06:24] said there was a first pull and he said
[1:06:26] there was some little fish he said there
[1:06:28] was a second pull he said and there was
[1:06:30] some more little fish he said but then
[1:06:32] there was a third pull and he said that
[1:06:34] third pull scattered the little fish
[1:06:36] amen but it caught the rainbow traps oh
[1:06:39] Church of the Living God do you see who
[1:06:42] you are this morning you're not just a
[1:06:44] little blue gill you're not just a
[1:06:46] little carp or a little trout amen but
[1:06:48] you are a rainbow trout who has been
[1:06:51] captured by the word of the hour that
[1:06:53] you're living in listen you're not here
[1:06:55] Amen to display depression you're not
[1:06:57] here to display anxiety you're not here
[1:07:00] to display suicide and to display
[1:07:02] Hollywood you have been sent into this
[1:07:05] age by The Calling of Jesus Christ to
[1:07:08] display the victory of what God can do
[1:07:10] in the flesh of a redeemed son and
[1:07:12] daughter of
[1:07:14] God Amen a trophy is an expressed
[1:07:17] attribute of the victory I love what the
[1:07:20] prophet of God says God's Great secret
[1:07:22] that he had before the world began he
[1:07:24] said it was now back in the back part of
[1:07:26] God's mind he said there was something
[1:07:29] he trying and was going to achieve
[1:07:32] somebody say trying and going to amen
[1:07:36] it's one thing to try it's another thing
[1:07:38] to do and he had a motive in doing it so
[1:07:41] in order to let himself be expressed
[1:07:43] because before there was a Moon Star
[1:07:45] atam molecule or anything he was God but
[1:07:48] he exactly wasn't God at that time
[1:07:51] because God is an object of worship and
[1:07:54] there wasn't nothing to worship him so
[1:07:56] in his great mind he wanted these
[1:07:59] attributes to be expressed in him was
[1:08:02] love in him was to be a father in him
[1:08:05] was to be a son in him was to be a
[1:08:07] savior in him was to be a Healer all
[1:08:10] these great attributes amen we see
[1:08:12] already expressed amen they were in God
[1:08:16] Amen you heard it last night amen the
[1:08:18] angels of God Amen could not manifest
[1:08:21] what a redeemed amen son and daughter of
[1:08:24] God can manifest can I just say it to
[1:08:26] you like this Amen brother brother Isaac
[1:08:28] there is God and he's a Healer he's a
[1:08:30] savior he's a deliverer amen he's a he's
[1:08:33] a redeemer amen he's a he's a lover he's
[1:08:35] a father amen and here's all the Angels
[1:08:38] brother Jason they're gathered around
[1:08:40] him and he shouts out I'm a Healer and
[1:08:43] they say yes Lord You're A Healer he
[1:08:45] says I'm a savior they say yes you're a
[1:08:47] savior he says no I'm a delivered they
[1:08:50] say oh yes you are delivered listen but
[1:08:52] they're not saying it by experience
[1:08:55] they're saying it by knowledge they know
[1:08:57] by knowledge that's what he is amen
[1:09:00] that's why the Angels can't give him
[1:09:02] what a son and daughter of God can
[1:09:04] that's why the Angels amen can't bless
[1:09:07] his name like a redeemed young person
[1:09:09] can listen the Angels can't tell him I
[1:09:12] was in a trap I was in a prison but the
[1:09:14] Holy Ghost come by my way but Landon can
[1:09:17] because God who is Rich and mercy has
[1:09:20] sent a message to release the authority
[1:09:23] and the quickening power to make it more
[1:09:25] than just an attribute but to make it an
[1:09:28] expression in the flesh of his
[1:09:32] church so when you raise your hands this
[1:09:34] morning and say he's a savior it does
[1:09:37] something for him thank you buddy when
[1:09:39] you raise your hands this morning and
[1:09:41] say Lord I was sick but I come in that
[1:09:43] prayer line and you healed me it does
[1:09:46] something for him when you say Lord I
[1:09:48] was empty hey but you sent the word and
[1:09:51] you healed me and you fed me it does
[1:09:54] something for him
[1:09:57] trophies of his attributes brother said
[1:10:00] you are nothing but the manifestation of
[1:10:02] the gene of life that was in God as the
[1:10:05] Son of God he said but now you are
[1:10:07] expressed amen watch after his word has
[1:10:11] come in you to light up this age you are
[1:10:14] expressing God's life in you because you
[1:10:17] are a son or a daughter of God you are
[1:10:20] now made you are sitting in this church
[1:10:23] tonight because your duty is to express

[1:10:36] foundation of the world he knew that you
[1:10:40] would be here I think Josh Bennett said
[1:10:42] it the best way he said I'm here because
[1:10:45] I was there and he said because I'm

[1:10:50] because I'm here is why I'm going back
[1:10:52] there oh come on young people I pray to

[1:11:03] revelation in your soul I come from God

[1:16:09] ashamed Amen to be identified with the
[1:16:11] prophet of God Amen but I am not ashamed
[1:16:14] to say I believe William Brandon was the
[1:16:16] pro prophet of God until this age I am
[1:16:19] not ashamed to stand behind the pull pit
[1:16:21] and read a quote of a prophet of God I
[1:16:23] am not ashamed to display amen what a
[1:16:26] prophet has said and what a prophet has
[1:16:28] revealed I am not ashamed hey you know
[1:16:31] why I'm not ashamed because I'm a
[1:16:34] trophy I am a trophy of the ministry of
[1:16:37] the seventh angel somebody say well amen
[1:16:39] that's put a little bit too much on a
[1:16:41] man no I'm not talking about a man I'm
[1:16:44] talking about the son of man who was
[1:16:46] revealed through a son of man and
[1:16:48] claimed a bride to fulfill his promises
[1:16:50] through when you think about this
[1:16:52] trophies and brother random refers to
[1:16:54] Trophies is people I love this he always
[1:16:57] connects these scriptures to trophies in
[1:16:59] John 5:24 he'll say verily verily I say
[1:17:02] unto you he that heareth my word and
[1:17:04] believeth on him that sent me ha
[1:17:07] everlasting life and shall not come into
[1:17:10] condemnation but is passed from Death
[1:17:12] unto life in John 6:37 all the father
[1:17:15] hath given me shall come and him that
[1:17:18] cometh to me I will in no wise cast out
[1:17:22] that's right another one John 10:28 can
[1:17:25] to to Trophies I give unto them eternal
[1:17:27] life and they shall never perish neither
[1:17:30] shall any man any man pluck them out of
[1:17:33] my hand because my father which gave
[1:17:35] them to me is greater than all and no
[1:17:39] man is able to pluck them out of my
[1:17:42] father's hands you know what I just feel

[1:17:57] got
[1:17:58] me if you were going to successfully get
[1:18:01] me you would have done got me but the
[1:18:03] reason why you ain't got me is cuz you
[1:18:05] can't get me because before you tried to
[1:18:08] get me my God gave me to Jesus and he
[1:18:10] put a seed in my soul and he claimed me
[1:18:13] for the manifestation of the word of
[1:18:15] truth and life in the age I'm living in
[1:18:17] let me say it devil you ain't got enough

[1:18:45] of your word that condemn their sinful
[1:18:47] life and they come to accept you as
[1:18:50] their personal savior so I'm pleading to
[1:18:52] you your promise bringing back to your
[1:18:55] remembrance that you said he that
[1:18:57] heareth my word and believeth on him
[1:19:00] that sent me amen they now accept your
[1:19:03] word they are sorry for their sins and
[1:19:05] have demonstrated the same and
[1:19:08] manifested it by taking a stand for you

[1:19:13] you've heard in the services and in the
[1:19:15] sessions amen can I tell you what theyve
[1:19:17] made you they have made you

[1:19:23] did not endorse a sin life it did not
[1:19:26] condone a Leo ofy a lukor Christian life
[1:19:29] but it condemned it and listen some of
[1:19:31] you all oh my can I just go ahead and

[1:19:36] condemned I'm just going to go ahead and
[1:19:37] say it he's
[1:19:38] condemned and he knows he's condemned
[1:19:41] that's why he wants to convince you that
[1:19:43] you're condemned because he knows he's
[1:19:46] condemned and headed for a lake of fire
[1:19:48] but he knows that you have a future can
[1:19:51] I just go ahead and say it to him and
[1:19:53] he's not in it
[1:19:56] you have a future and the devil is not
[1:19:59] in
[1:20:01] it what are you saying their trophies
[1:20:03] that God has given to his son Christ
[1:20:04] Jesus by the power of His presence and
[1:20:07] the word of God can I say this the
[1:20:09] message of the hour it's more than a
[1:20:11] religion it's more than a Sunday sermon
[1:20:14] or it's more than a book or a tape amen
[1:20:16] but the message of the hour is a
[1:20:17] claiming message you say preacher what
[1:20:20] do you mean he says I claim them for you
[1:20:22] tonight Jesus as your own personal
[1:20:24] treasure

[1:20:31] me ask you this if something's going to
[1:20:33] claim you amen what is the something

[1:20:51] the basis of knowing this is the word
[1:20:55] that's being revealed so Church you
[1:20:58] don't claim this message but this
[1:21:00] message claimed you you was not looking
[1:21:03] for this message but this message was
[1:21:05] looking for you let me say this young
[1:21:07] people you were claimed on purpose for a
[1:21:10] purpose and by a purpose and let me just
[1:21:13] say this it's not an accident
[1:21:16] either you were claimed on purpose for a
[1:21:19] purpose and by a purpose can I just say
[1:21:22] it you were claimed in this age to be a
[1:21:25] trophy and what's claiming you is the
[1:21:27] revealing of the word in the age you're
[1:21:30] living in that's why I say if we're
[1:21:32] going to take a pullit let's say only
[1:21:35] what a prophet has already said I cannot
[1:21:38] claim you as a bride based on what Billy
[1:21:40] Graham taught I cannot claim you as a
[1:21:42] bride based on what or Roberts taught I
[1:21:45] can't even claim you as a bride based on
[1:21:47] what smiley face in Texas teaches but I
[1:21:49] can claim you based on the revelation of
[1:21:52] Jesus Christ underneath the author ity
[1:21:55] of the pillar of fire listen I didn't
[1:21:56] come here just for a church service I
[1:21:58] didn't come here just to preach a sermon
[1:22:00] I come here to draw my sword and stand
[1:22:03] Toe to Toe with that devil and say I
[1:22:05] claim every one of these young people
[1:22:07] for the manifestation of Truth for the
[1:22:09] manifestation of life and for the
[1:22:11] realities of God the unfailing realities
[1:22:14] of God to live and to manifest in their
[1:22:18] lives they say what are you talking

[1:22:33] destitute of a life that recognizes and
[1:22:36] is devoted to God listen you were dead
[1:22:38] in sin but you have be quickened us
[1:22:40] together with Christ by grace are you
[1:22:44] saved can I say this here is those who
[1:22:46] were dead and has been raised up he said
[1:22:49] there is there is those here who were in
[1:22:52] accidents they were smashed up and they
[1:22:54] are healed you say preacher I got to die
[1:22:56] and go to heaven to be a trophy that's a
[1:22:58] lie of the devil he said I see Miss
[1:23:00] Wilson standing here that not long ago
[1:23:03] she was hemorrhaging to death with TB
[1:23:05] but here she is tonight amen the doctors
[1:23:08] didn't give her but just hours to live
[1:23:11] amen but here she stands tonight I love
[1:23:15] that here she stands tonight he said all
[1:23:18] around through here there's lame blind
[1:23:20] crippled in wheelchairs everything but
[1:23:22] look what a prophet says he said there's
[1:23:24] standing tonight as living trophies why
[1:23:27] because Jesus Christ lives he's the same
[1:23:30] yesterday today and forever do you see a
[1:23:34] position that the prophet of God put you
[1:23:37] in he didn't say here they are laying
[1:23:39] here they are sitting here they are
[1:23:41] barely getting by he said but here they
[1:23:43] are standing as trophies of the Living
[1:23:46] God do you know what Paul said he said
[1:23:49] having done all to stand amen then just
[1:23:51] stand therefore having your loin gir
[1:23:53] about with truth having on the
[1:23:55] breastplate of righteousness and your
[1:23:57] feet shod with the preparation of the
[1:24:00] Gospel but you know what I don't find in
[1:24:02] there I don't find any armor on your
[1:24:05] back I don't find any armor on your back
[1:24:08] or on your ankles or on come on church
[1:24:10] or the back of your head you know why
[1:24:12] because we don't run from this devil we
[1:24:15] run to this
[1:24:17] devil we don't back up from this devil
[1:24:20] we face this devil because we're not
[1:24:22] here under just a church visit ation he
[1:24:25] said we're here underneath the
[1:24:27] visitation of the Angel of the Lord he
[1:24:30] said if the deaf don't hear or the dumb
[1:24:32] don't speak the blind don't see the
[1:24:33] crippled don't walk if Prophecies of sin
[1:24:36] isn't foretold and the people and your
[1:24:38] sins from this time you as a child
[1:24:40] foretold them that believe that this
[1:24:42] Angel come to me is false I'm false with
[1:24:44] it but if it manifests itself here on
[1:24:47] the platform before you you believe it
[1:24:50] repent of your sins and disbelief for
[1:24:53] the hour of his visitation is Drawing
[1:24:56] Near for he only does these things to
[1:24:59] confirm his works now let me just say
[1:25:02] this when God makes a visitation to an
[1:25:04] age he doesn't do it
[1:25:07] unannounced he don't just walk in and
[1:25:10] say I'm here I just decided to come by
[1:25:13] no he announces it in his word see like
[1:25:16] the father was in the son all that was
[1:25:18] in God he poured into Christ right and
[1:25:21] all that was in Christ he has poured
[1:25:23] into you the church he said believe thou
[1:25:26] not that I'm in the father and the
[1:25:27] father in me the words that I speak unto
[1:25:29] you I speak not of myself amen but the
[1:25:32] father that dwelleth in me he doeth The
[1:25:35] Works believe me that I am in the father
[1:25:38] and the father is in me or else believe
[1:25:40] for the very word's sake verily I say
[1:25:42] unto you he that believeth on me the
[1:25:45] works that I do shall he do also I'm
[1:25:48] talking about you and Greater Works than
[1:25:51] these shall he do because I go unto my
[1:25:54] father listen friends because Jesus
[1:25:56] ascended to the father and is Seated on
[1:25:59] the right hand of God in the Throne of
[1:26:00] majesty that does not mean that we're an
[1:26:03] idle Church without the power to operate
[1:26:06] the way he operated when he was here on
[1:26:08] the earth remember picks this up and
[1:26:10] said now in Jesus in his ministry the
[1:26:12] first thing verily verily which is
[1:26:14] absolutely I say unto you he that
[1:26:16] believeth on me amen The Works that I do
[1:26:18] he should do also and More Than This the
[1:26:21] word more translated is not greater
[1:26:23] because raised the dead sto nature there
[1:26:26] was nothing could be any greater than
[1:26:27] what he did but more than this shall you
[1:26:29] do for I go to my father do you believe
[1:26:33] that's the inspired word of God now the
[1:26:35] same thing he did he promised the church
[1:26:38] to do only more of it than what he did
[1:26:41] in St John 21:25 I love what John says
[1:26:45] he says there are also many other things
[1:26:47] which Jesus did the which if they should
[1:26:49] be written in everyone I suppose that
[1:26:51] even the world itself could not contain
[1:26:55] amen the books that should be written
[1:26:57] Amen in other words there's going to
[1:26:59] come amen so many victories in the lives
[1:27:02] of Believers by the power of the word of
[1:27:04] God that there's not even going to be
[1:27:06] able to be books wrote about
[1:27:08] it he said I wish I could testify for a
[1:27:11] little bit he said just tell you what
[1:27:12] I've seen happen last few weeks you know
[1:27:14] John and Luke said if or John Rather if
[1:27:16] all these things would be put in books
[1:27:18] there was enough books in the world to
[1:27:19] write it just what I've seen in my own
[1:27:21] Ministry what I've seen him do you
[1:27:24] couldn't pile the volumes on this
[1:27:26] platform here if I wrote in details what
[1:27:29] I seen him do in just my own Ministry
[1:27:31] see seen him do it see he had now listen
[1:27:34] to the prophet he had more success in my
[1:27:37] Ministry than he did in his own now
[1:27:40] remember he had more success now not me
[1:27:43] he had he had more success in
[1:27:46] Jeffersonville than he did in Nazareth
[1:27:48] he did in a wicked City amen glory cause
[1:27:51] he could perform no Miracles there
[1:27:53] listen he could perform no Miracles
[1:27:55] there because there was no seed Amen to
[1:27:58] recognize his visitation in the hour
[1:28:01] that they was living but in this
[1:28:03] generation there has been a seven seal
[1:28:05] book revealed and there is a seed in the
[1:28:08] heart of this young
[1:28:10] people listen he couldn't break through
[1:28:12] in Nazareth he couldn't break through in
[1:28:14] those Wicked cities he said but he
[1:28:15] finally broke through here he finally
[1:28:18] got it done here right here in
[1:28:19] Jeffersonville he might have had to get
[1:28:21] people somewhere else but he got it done
[1:28:23] anyhow now he had more success right
[1:28:26] here than he did in capernium or
[1:28:28] Nazareth he done more miracles right
[1:28:30] here in this Tabernacle that he did in
[1:28:33] the entire Ministry on Earth that's

[1:28:59] meeting he broke through in this meeting

[1:29:04] through in anointing he broke through in
[1:29:06] Revelation he bro oh God and you know
[1:29:09] how he done it he done it by the
[1:29:11] preaching of the promises pertaining to
[1:29:13] the gene that he has put in this age you
[1:29:16] say now remember now remember here's
[1:29:18] what he said he done now it never said I
[1:29:20] done it amen see cuz I didn't do it I
[1:29:23] just didn't I just loved him and just
[1:29:26] submitted myself to him and said what he
[1:29:29] said and the Holy Spirit went to the
[1:29:32] other people and they believed what he
[1:29:34] said and then he done the
[1:29:38] work can I read that to you again I just
[1:29:41] loved him and just submitted myself to
[1:29:44] him and I said what he said and the Holy
[1:29:47] Spirit went to the other people and they
[1:29:49] believe what he said and then he done
[1:29:52] the work that's what he was saying in
[1:29:54] Luke 19 in 1 Peter 2 it was speaking of
[1:29:57] the day of visitation or the hour of
[1:30:00] visitation or the time of visitation you
[1:30:03] know what that day is also called it is
[1:30:05] also called the day of salvation the day
[1:30:09] or hour of visitation was speaking of
[1:30:12] the coming of the Messiah listen the
[1:30:15] very presence of God's Messiah amen the
[1:30:18] Son of God himself would return in the
[1:30:21] authority of his person would reveal
[1:30:24] himself come on church but what good
[1:30:27] does it do to reveal if there's nothing
[1:30:29] there to catch what's being revealed
[1:30:31] listen we would have one testimony here
[1:30:33] this weekend if there wasn't a seed in
[1:30:36] your soul to receive the preaching of
[1:30:38] the unadulterated word of God this
[1:30:40] meeting ain't built on music it ain't
[1:30:42] built on a hot guitar or a fast pet of
[1:30:45] drums this meeting is built on the
[1:30:47] preaching of the message of the hour as
[1:30:50] revealed by the seventh angel and as
[1:30:52] long as somebody will preach it God will
[1:30:54] put somebody in those pews to believe it
[1:30:56] and they'll accept it and the Holy
[1:30:58] Spirit will be liberated to move
[1:31:00] throughout the congregation come on
[1:31:02] church if they couldn't write books
[1:31:03] about Jesus and they couldn't write
[1:31:05] books about brother brandham then there
[1:31:07] is a five-fold Ministry in this Earth
[1:31:09] today who is carrying the same gospel
[1:31:11] can I just say this you're a part of
[1:31:13] those
[1:31:14] works you got a chapter in those volumes
[1:31:18] that can't be wrote about because Jesus
[1:31:20] has sent a word to catch you look here
[1:31:22] in Luke 19 I'm feeling good in Luke 19
[1:31:26] when he come he beheld the city and he
[1:31:28] wept over it saying if thou had us known
[1:31:32] even thou at the least in this thy day
[1:31:34] the things which belong of thy peace but
[1:31:37] now they are HID from thine eyes for the
[1:31:39] day shall come upon thee that thine
[1:31:41] enemy shall cast a trench about thee and
[1:31:44] Compass thee roundabout and keep thee in
[1:31:46] on every side they shall lay thee even
[1:31:48] with the ground and thy children within
[1:31:51] thee now I just want to take a Liberty
[1:31:54] here can I just can I just preach to you
[1:31:56] for a second from that amen let me say
[1:31:58] this thank God for elders who didn't
[1:32:00] kill the
[1:32:02] babies what are you talking about I'm
[1:32:04] not talking about natural abortion
[1:32:05] that's of the devil same as spiritual
[1:32:07] abortion
[1:32:09] is come on this message is a message of
[1:32:11] seed it's a message of progression when
[1:32:14] I say progression I mean it's a message
[1:32:16] of continuation when I say continuation
[1:32:19] I don't mean brother br's got to come
[1:32:21] back and do something I mean what he
[1:32:23] preached in is continuing in the Next
[1:32:25] Generation do you realize the Bible said
[1:32:28] amen that one generation shall receive
[1:32:31] the next are you hearing me and the
[1:32:33] Revival fires shall burn in the
[1:32:35] authority of the word upon that new
[1:32:38] generation young people let me say it as
[1:32:40] plain as I know how I salute you as a
[1:32:43] group of young people who has not
[1:32:45] watered this message down to a bunch of
[1:32:47] Daddy's religion and Mama's ideas and a
[1:32:50] preacher sermon but it has become a
[1:32:52] value to you it has become a way of
[1:32:54] walking and talking and
[1:32:56] believing you recognize your day of
[1:33:00] visitation you say what are you saying
[1:33:02] he only appears to those who are looking
[1:33:04] for
[1:33:06] him look at the woman at the well the
[1:33:08] woman said unto him I know look at that
[1:33:10] word know it means to have an interview
[1:33:12] with to
[1:33:13] visit she said I know that Messiah is
[1:33:16] coming which is called Christ and when
[1:33:18] he comes he will tell us all things
[1:33:21] Jesus saith unto her I but speak unto
[1:33:25] thee am
[1:33:27] he in other words quit looking for him
[1:33:31] he's
[1:33:32] here brother said the woman at the well
[1:33:35] she recognized her day by the sign of
[1:33:38] the Messiah when she recognized her hour
[1:33:41] of visitation you know what she become
[1:33:43] she become a trophy of his visitation
[1:33:46] but what done it was the grace of God to
[1:33:49] that woman's life she was a prostitute
[1:33:52] she had been married five
[1:33:55] times St John 4 New Testament she had
[1:33:59] been married five times and the one she
[1:34:01] was living with was not even her husband
[1:34:04] do you realize she did not have a voice
[1:34:06] of authority do you know that because of
[1:34:08] her condition nobody had to listen to
[1:34:11] her do you know when she was in that
[1:34:13] condition before she met the Messiah let
[1:34:15] me just break it down to you like this
[1:34:17] if there was a father and his son and
[1:34:19] they were out in town and the woman at
[1:34:21] the well was walking by that father told
[1:34:23] him his son if she says anything to you
[1:34:26] don't you listen to her don't you listen
[1:34:29] to her because she's a harlot and she
[1:34:31] don't have a position she don't have a
[1:34:33] right to say anything listen not even oh
[1:34:36] God not even the kids would listen to
[1:34:38] her not even the babies they would laugh
[1:34:40] in her face and walk on and do what they
[1:34:42] wanted to because of her present
[1:34:45] condition oh but then she met the
[1:34:48] master oh but then she met the Messiah
[1:34:51] oh but one day she had an interview with
[1:34:53] Jesus Jesus Christ one day she met him
[1:34:56] in the power of his resurrection one day
[1:34:58] she met him in the power of His word
[1:35:00] rather and she stood there and she
[1:35:02] looked at him and she said the Jews have
[1:35:04] nothing to do with the Samaritans he
[1:35:06] said if you knew who I was you would ask
[1:35:08] me for a drink Hey listen when she
[1:35:11] recognized the message of the hour the
[1:35:13] Bible says she dropped her water bucket
[1:35:15] and she ran into the city you know what
[1:35:18] she did she said come see a
[1:35:21] man 5 minutes before before that they
[1:35:24] didn't have to listen to her but the
[1:35:26] Bible says men listen to her and they
[1:35:29] followed her to find this
[1:35:31] Messiah can I just say it like I want to
[1:35:33] say it without this message we're

[1:36:09] transformation of her life by the
[1:36:12] recognition of his visitation what are

[1:37:17] life was headed for without this message
[1:37:20] but God who is rich in Mercy picked up
[1:37:22] an old piece of tent tenness dur that
[1:37:24] was just a country boy but he saved me
[1:37:27] and he give me a family and he give me a

[1:39:10] what the Bible says the Bible said he
[1:39:12] threw his net down and he said Lord I'll
[1:39:14] follow you and God took a man who was
[1:39:17] full of mistakes but had more Revelation
[1:39:19] he was full of mistakes but God used him
[1:39:22] to catch an influence others listen I'm
[1:39:24] not here to point you to Andrew Clover
[1:39:26] I'm not here to point you to any
[1:39:28] Ministry I'm here to say there is a
[1:39:30] message and it's a Vindicated message
[1:39:32] and whatever a prophet T it's the truth
[1:39:36] I don't care who says it's not I don't
[1:39:38] care who tries to bring their opinion or
[1:39:40] their little religious education behind
[1:39:43] the pulpit and contradict what a prophet
[1:39:45] said I've got the grace of the aesan
[1:39:47] church age to say you're a liar and
[1:39:50] you're not saying what a prophet said
[1:39:52] and if you ain't going to say what the
[1:39:53] prophet said get out of the way and let
[1:39:56] somebody up who will to help this next
[1:39:58] Generation believe that what a prophet
[1:40:00] taught is the
[1:40:02] truth it's the truth what are you saying
[1:40:06] I'm saying when God sends a visitation
[1:40:08] you'll either recognize it or you will
[1:40:10] reject
[1:40:13] it and if you reject it you will
[1:40:16] continue on as the rest of the others
[1:40:18] have but look at Abraham I love this one
[1:40:22] the Bible says Abraham and Sarah were
[1:40:25] sitting in the tent and the Sarah and
[1:40:28] Abraham hastened and said make ready
[1:40:30] three quickly three measures of fine
[1:40:31] meal needed and make cakes upon the
[1:40:33] Hearth and Abraham ran to the herd fetch
[1:40:36] a calf tender oh God and good and give
[1:40:40] it unto a young man and he he hastened
[1:40:42] to dress it and he took butter and milk
[1:40:45] you know it was good if there was some
[1:40:46] butter in
[1:40:48] it that's the South coming out and the
[1:40:51] calf which he had dressed and said
[1:40:53] before them and he stood by them under
[1:40:55] the tree and they did eat said what
[1:40:57] happened is Abraham was sitting in the
[1:40:59] door of his tent on a real hot day there
[1:41:02] was a lot of complaints about the
[1:41:03] message I mean there was a lot of
[1:41:04] complaints and the grass was all gone
[1:41:07] and the land was drying up and the
[1:41:09] cattle was becoming very thin the water
[1:41:11] supply was just about all gone they
[1:41:13] found water holes in the land and the
[1:41:15] water got low they would dig out and dig
[1:41:17] out until they got down to where the
[1:41:19] water was sweeping through the rocks and
[1:41:21] still the cattle didn't have enough
[1:41:22] water to supply the he said you know
[1:41:24] sometimes when things are going wrong We
[1:41:26] Know by Nature it's the darkest amen
[1:41:29] just before day and many times we see
[1:41:31] disastrous things happening like that
[1:41:33] especially to the Believers we must bear
[1:41:36] this in mind that it's Satan trying to
[1:41:39] block amen the blessing that's on its
[1:41:41] Road somebody say the
[1:41:43] blessing somebody preach with me the
[1:41:46] blessing you say the blessing what is
[1:41:48] the blessing the blessing is the promise
[1:41:50] of a body change to bring forth a
[1:41:52] promised son now can I just say
[1:41:54] something to you here I I love studying
[1:41:56] brother Brandon cuz he just brings out
[1:41:58] things you'll never catch he said Satan
[1:42:00] was trying to tempt them to feel that
[1:42:03] they had done wrong
[1:42:06] wow Satan was trying to tempt them to
[1:42:09] feel they had done wrong when the
[1:42:11] blessing was on its way the devil was
[1:42:14] tempting them to tell them you've done
[1:42:16] wrong you know why he was doing that so
[1:42:18] when the blessing showed up they would
[1:42:20] not entertain it he was trying to block
[1:42:23] the oncoming visitation that God was
[1:42:25] going to give to Abraham and Sarah right
[1:42:28] at the time of visitation Satan reaches
[1:42:32] over into the inner sense of f or the
[1:42:34] outer sense rather of F and begins to
[1:42:36] make them feel like they've done wrong
[1:42:39] makes them feel they're not worthy of
[1:42:41] the visitation because Satan oh God
[1:42:44] Satan did not want them to become a
[1:42:47] visitation trophy of elohim's visitation
[1:42:51] he said Abraham was sitting under his
[1:42:52] tent there come two angels and God
[1:42:54] walking up to him in human flesh they
[1:42:57] had dust on their clothes they were
[1:42:59] weary and they sat down he said oh my
[1:43:02] and Abraham killed the cow he got some
[1:43:04] butter he got some buttermilk he took it
[1:43:06] out there and set it down and God eat it
[1:43:08] he said Hallelujah that's the reason my
[1:43:10] faith looks up to thee thou lamb of
[1:43:12] Calvary you think that's a big thing for
[1:43:14] God God who made all the God God who
[1:43:19] made all the potach and calciums and
[1:43:21] everything in the world he come down to
[1:43:24] visit Abraham oh Church of the Living

[1:43:30] this morning you are a part of the Seed
[1:43:33] of Abraham I say this morning the same
[1:43:36] Elohim that visited Abraham has been
[1:43:39] promised and prophesied to return to
[1:43:42] this
[1:43:43] generation what are you saying I'm
[1:43:45] saying God promised a gentile period
[1:43:48] would have a message or a visitation
[1:43:51] with Elohim not 61 the Paradox he said
[1:43:55] the Gentiles message amen it started by
[1:43:58] a visitation of the pillar of fire and
[1:44:01] it ends the same way in the unveiling of
[1:44:04] God brother says this he said oh what is

[1:44:09] Word was with God and the Word was God

[1:44:35] of his word to fulfill his
[1:44:38] promise come on this ain't just a little
[1:44:40] church service this ain't just brother

[1:44:43] see what we can do and what we can
[1:44:45] produce and make a name for ourselves no

[1:44:49] people can come for to have a visitation
[1:44:53] with
[1:44:56] Elohim to fellowship with MDC what are
[1:44:59] you saying I say this our visitation has
[1:45:02] come to us in the form of the message of
[1:45:06] the
[1:45:07] hour can I stir up your minds by the
[1:45:10] pure way of remembrance this morning the
[1:45:12] Bible said that the Lord went before
[1:45:15] them by day in a pillar of cloud to lead
[1:45:17] them the
[1:45:18] way give me that first
[1:45:21] picture and by night in a pillar of
[1:45:26] fire to give them light to go by day the
[1:45:30] other picture the first one the other
[1:45:33] one one two 3
[1:45:36] one to go before them by day and night
[1:45:39] he took not away thank you the pillar of
[1:45:41] cloud by
[1:45:43] day we love our s guys don't we give
[1:45:46] them a
[1:45:48] hand and our audio guys and visual guys
[1:45:53] sometimes you get to preaching and you
[1:45:54] say things and people think man the
[1:45:55] preachers MTH the world at them
[1:45:57] no we'll eat a steak someday By Night by
[1:46:01] day he took not away the pillar of cloud
[1:46:03] by day with butter on it Lord the pillar
[1:46:05] of Fire by night from before the people
[1:46:08] in
[1:46:09] 1950 the pillar of fire appeared in
[1:46:12] Houston Coliseum but look where it's no
[1:46:14] go back but look where it's at it's
[1:46:17] hanging over a prophet's head he it's
[1:46:19] hanging there amen as a headship it's
[1:46:22] hang hanging there as a visitation now
[1:46:24] can I show you something where is
[1:46:26] brother brandom at in the picture he's
[1:46:29] not above the pillar of fire he's
[1:46:31] beneath the pillar of fire in other
[1:46:34] words where is this microphone at it's
[1:46:36] not above my
[1:46:39] head it's underneath my mouth so what
[1:46:42] I'm saying I'm using a microphone to say
[1:46:45] it the pillar of fire had taken brother
[1:46:48] brandom as a microphone for the
[1:46:51] revelation of Elohim in this generation
[1:46:54] and he claimed his body to begin to
[1:46:56] speak the thoughts of God that was on
[1:46:59] the back part of God's mind you know
[1:47:02] what he did he stood there Thomas and he
[1:47:04] said things contrary to what the Baptist
[1:47:06] called he said things contrary to what
[1:47:08] religious leaders T you know why because
[1:47:11] it was Elohim who was not going to be
[1:47:14] stopped by the denomination because
[1:47:16] there was a blessing in what a prophet
[1:47:18] was going to
[1:47:19] say oh young people if you don't get
[1:47:22] nothing else get this you're blessed I
[1:47:25] said you're blessed I don't know what
[1:47:27] you're going home to I don't know what
[1:47:29] situations you're facing but there is a
[1:47:31] blessing of God upon your life can I
[1:47:33] tell you what it is it's an irreversible
[1:47:37] blessing in other words God puts it on
[1:47:39] you and the devil can't do nothing about
[1:47:41] it God puts it on you and the devil
[1:47:44] can't change
[1:47:46] it you're blessed because of the message
[1:47:50] of the hour
[1:47:55] behold I will send you Elijah the
[1:47:57] prophet amen give me that second picture
[1:47:59] of the cloud Revelation 101 I saw
[1:48:02] another Mighty
[1:48:04] Angel come down from heaven clo with a
[1:48:08] cloud and a rainbow was upon his head
[1:48:10] and his face as it were the Sun and his
[1:48:13] feet as pillars of fire 1963 the Third
[1:48:16] Exodus there it is they don't know what
[1:48:18] it's all about the scientists are trying
[1:48:21] to and anybody got a picture of it
[1:48:24] called in quote a cloud 26 Mi high in
[1:48:29] the shape of a pyramid I don't have time
[1:48:31] to bog down in these areas but I'm just
[1:48:33] going to lay some some things here seven
[1:48:35] angels represent in there watch this and
[1:48:38] brought back and brought you the word of
[1:48:42] God when Elohim came to Abraham and
[1:48:45] Sarah he was bringing them the
[1:48:48] confirmation of the Covenant of blessing
[1:48:50] upon their life to change their bodies
[1:48:53] to produce the promised son oh young
[1:48:56] people I can't help but get excited I
[1:48:58] can't help but get enthused that in
[1:49:01] 1962 there was a cloud appeared and it
[1:49:03] was more than just a cloud it was more
[1:49:06] than just a scientific object it was
[1:49:08] Elohim returning to this generation in a
[1:49:12] visitation of his
[1:49:14] word listen and brought you the word of
[1:49:17] God under the inspiration it tells you
[1:49:20] these hours you're coming and living in
[1:49:22] and the spirit spiritual mind will'll
[1:49:23] pick it right now see and get it it's an
[1:49:26] exodus oh Hallelujah well glory to God
[1:49:30] somebody shout hallelujah brother Carl
[1:49:32] it's an exodus in the house of God let
[1:49:35] me say devil fight us while you can
[1:49:38] torment us why you can we're going to
[1:49:40] leave here one of these
[1:49:42] mornings the word of God has been
[1:49:44] restored by the visitation of Elohim in
[1:49:48] my generation I'm standing on the sayth
[1:49:51] the Lord I'm standing on Vindicated word
[1:49:55] and the devil can't do nothing about
[1:49:58] [Applause]
[1:50:02] it somebody say praise God
[1:50:05] God but in the days of the
[1:50:08] voice of the seventh angel when he shall
[1:50:12] begin to sound give me that third
[1:50:14] picture we seen the pillar of fire above
[1:50:17] him we seen the cloud come down but in
[1:50:20] 1900s he stands behind the pull
[1:50:23] pit and what's he
[1:50:26] doing
[1:50:28] preaching so anybody tells you preaching
[1:50:31] ain't important is a ly
[1:50:38] devil it's a dangerous spot I got a
[1:50:41] sword anybody that tells you preaching
[1:50:44] is foolish it is but it's the way men
[1:50:47] are saved and if anybody tells you that
[1:50:50] you don't need to have a preacher
[1:50:51] because you got a Prophet that's a Lon
[1:50:53] Spirit from the pits of Hell will the
[1:50:56] real brother brandom didn't teach that
[1:50:58] nonsense come on I'm just going to go
[1:51:00] ahead and cut that devil's head off
[1:51:01] because we got a generation now that
[1:51:03] don't even know what it means to go to
[1:51:05] church because all of a sudden
[1:51:06] everything's done at home they stream at
[1:51:08] home they listen at home but let me say
[1:51:10] what the Bible says forsake not the
[1:51:13] assembling of yourselves together I say
[1:51:15] young people rise up as a generation who
[1:51:18] has recognized the visitation of Elohim
[1:51:21] and strike Bel on this way out of see
[1:51:23] and devil that's crawled in this message
[1:51:25] and it's trying to empty our churches
[1:51:27] and empty our pulpits I refuse to
[1:51:30] believe that the church is in vain and
[1:51:32] that every preacher is false I reject
[1:51:35] that devil in the name of Jesus and I
[1:51:37] say by the word of Truth God is going to
[1:51:39] raise up preachers here he's going to
[1:51:41] raise up beacons here he's going to
[1:51:43] raise up song leaders and Sunday school
[1:51:45] teachers and Holy Ghost filled church
[1:51:47] members that knows what it's like to be
[1:51:50] the Church of the firstborn
[1:51:52] [Applause]
[1:52:00] brother B didn't teach
[1:52:03] that somebody told me one time lady
[1:52:06] sorry brother Jason I guess my contracts
[1:52:08] up so I just have fun this
[1:52:10] morning somebody told me one time you
[1:52:12] know what they said they said you know
[1:52:14] what brother Andrew said that was from
[1:52:15] the said that that going not going to
[1:52:17] church ask the Lord I said funny thing
[1:52:19] to me is God built churches and
[1:52:20] Tabernacles and put Ministry in them and
[1:52:23] all of a sudden the church is useless
[1:52:25] might say well the way it ought to be is
[1:52:26] just stay home and listen to a tape well
[1:52:28] let me tell you what brother BR said
[1:52:29] about that are you ready for it got your
[1:52:31] pen and pencil down ready to write it
[1:52:33] down it wasn't so from the
[1:52:35] beginning now either he's a word Prophet
[1:52:38] or we're following another Theologian
[1:52:40] but I propose to you this morning he was
[1:52:42] the voice of authority on every
[1:52:45] scripture in this Bible he was the voice
[1:52:47] of authority on Hebrews 10:25 and what
[1:52:49] he said oh here it is brother Donnie if
[1:52:51] you got God in your heart you can't wait
[1:52:54] for them doors to get open so we just
[1:52:57] solved the problem God ain't in your
[1:52:59] heart but if God was in your heart you
[1:53:02] couldn't wait to get to the house of God
[1:53:04] and shake your brother's hand and hug
[1:53:05] your sister's neck and sing the songs of
[1:53:08] son but oh Joshua generation rise up
[1:53:11] this morning with an Elohim Revelation
[1:53:14] and Strike Back Against that devil and
[1:53:17] walk don't just walk that God sent a
[1:53:20] prophet walk in what he said walk in
[1:53:23] what he
[1:53:26] Tau a Divine or a man that's tell future
[1:53:29] events were coming to pass then we come
[1:53:31] to pass exactly without failure hear him
[1:53:34] for I am with him let me bring this down
[1:53:37] Revelation 138 so when he stands there
[1:53:40] and begins to preach the pillar of fire
[1:53:42] that's above him you now see it all over
[1:53:46] him that's
[1:53:48] right so now he's speaking the word
[1:53:53] and he's beginning to say things like
[1:53:55] all that dwell upon the Earth shall
[1:53:56] worship Him whose names are not written
[1:54:00] in the Book of
[1:54:03] Life of the lamb slain from the
[1:54:06] foundation of the world Revelation 178
[1:54:09] the Beast that thou sawest wasn't is not
[1:54:10] and shall Ascend out the bom's pit and
[1:54:12] go into predition and they that dwell on
[1:54:16] the Earth shall
[1:54:18] wonder you're on the earth this morning
[1:54:21] they shall Wonder
[1:54:23] but listen you're not
[1:54:26] wondering why are you not wondering
[1:54:28] whose names were not written in the Book
[1:54:30] of Life from the foundation world when
[1:54:31] the Beast behold was is not and yet is
[1:54:34] butam comes in 1963 in the first seal
[1:54:37] and he says now listen here now real
[1:54:38] close now listen you won't have to
[1:54:41] wonder no more what it
[1:54:46] is elohim's visitation to this
[1:54:49] generation was the ending of wondering
[1:54:52] that's
[1:54:55] right let me close on this but there
[1:54:58] before God can pour out his judgment
[1:55:00] Upon A people he has to make a way of
[1:55:02] Escape for everyone who desires to
[1:55:03] receive it this is your day of
[1:55:06] visitation I'm just going to say what
[1:55:08] your Prophet said you might not want to
[1:55:10] believe it because an uneducated
[1:55:11] Minister said
[1:55:13] it but don't pay attention to the
[1:55:16] messenger pay attention to the message

[1:55:40] message that he firmly declares to be
[1:55:43] the truth what are you saying brother
[1:55:45] Andrew I'm saying when this message
[1:55:47] begins to sound It's the Return of the
[1:55:50] entire deity of God amongst people it's
[1:55:53] the visitation of preparation for
[1:55:57] translation the next thing coming for
[1:55:59] you young people is a

[1:56:09] start home but all of a sudden we might
[1:56:11] be
[1:56:12] changed in the moment in the twinkling
[1:56:15] of an eye and our loved ones begin to
[1:56:17] appear are you hearing me he said the
[1:56:20] old world is just right for judgment it

[1:56:50] picture before it can be hung in a Hall
[1:56:51] of Fame and has to go through the Hall
[1:56:52] of critics and I believe the little
[1:56:53] churches went through the Hall of
[1:56:54] critics and now soon there'll come a
[1:56:56] scream from the heavens and God is going
[1:56:58] to hang it in the Hall of Fame to take
[1:57:00] it out by the Rapture to take it up to
[1:57:06] Glory you say preacher what is the
[1:57:08] rapture the Rapture is the Gathering of

[1:57:38] Earth is is the proven grounds and where
[1:57:41] he's trying to prove you The Proving
[1:57:45] Grounds on the earth is here before the
