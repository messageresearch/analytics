[26:41] God bless you. It's
[26:45] It's very scary to stand here. I have to
[26:48] just say this. I don't
[26:51] It's never easy for me to be up here.
[26:52] I'm not a a singer.
[26:55] But I did promise the Lord years ago if
[26:57] he gave me a song that I would do my
[26:59] best to sing it.
[27:02] even if I have a heart attack.
[27:05] But about three weeks ago, this song
[27:09] just started kind of dropping into my
[27:11] heart and I have not been able to get
[27:12] away from it. And it's been really weird
[27:14] just
[27:17] the things that he's kept putting right
[27:19] in front of my face. And so I know that
[27:22] this is him and I pray that it'll be a
[27:23] blessing. And it just came from the
[27:26] inspiration of that that vision that
[27:28] brother Brandham had of us at the end.
[27:31] And we know that's right where we're
[27:33] standing. And
[27:35] I just feel like we have to really step
[27:38] back and take a really close look at
[27:40] what he said because
[27:42] it's life or death.
[27:45] So I pray that I can sing this.
[27:50] When the enemy comes in like a flood,
[27:57] God will raise a standard.
[28:05] I'll just sing it acappella. I'm sorry.
[28:08] I haven't practiced with anyone. Hello.
[28:12] When the enemy [singing] comes in like a
[28:14] flood,
[28:18] God will raise a standard. [singing]
[28:22] His wife is to be set apart.

[30:56] will [singing] you compromise?

[32:13] give him a hand. [applause]
[32:17] [music]
[32:51] Amen. I certainly want to be his
[32:53] standard.
[32:56] Certainly appreciated [music] that song,
[32:57] Sister Sharon. That was that was
[32:59] beautiful, too. Our young people, I tell
[33:02] you, I was so encouraged the other
[33:03] night. We were at brother Brad's and we
[33:06] had a good turnout. And
[33:09] you know, the main theme that they had,
[33:11] which really [music] really encouraged
[33:13] me, was to see that they had a such a
[33:16] desire to see their friends come to the
[33:19] Lord. such a desire [music] to see the
[33:21] the ones who aren't here anymore to
[33:23] reach out to them and and the ones maybe
[33:25] that are here that are drifting a little
[33:27] bit to beckon them come on up a little
[33:29] higher. I tell you what, that's just my
[33:32] goodness, it [music] just encouraged me
[33:34] so good. So, we need to pray for our
[33:37] young people and just hold them up.
[33:43] You don't think you
[33:45] [music] didn't have time to run over?
[33:47] All right, you can do that.
[33:49] Y'all pray for us this morning.
[33:52] You love him.
[33:55] Is it up?
[33:58] Good.
[34:00] In the Bible, we read [singing]
[34:03] how Lazarus
[34:06] was laid at the rich man's gate,
[34:12] [music]
[34:13] full [singing]
[34:14] of sores,
[34:16] desiring the crumbs that [music] fell
[34:20] [singing] from the rich man's plate.
[34:25] [music] When he died, he was carried by
[34:30] angels
[34:32] to the [singing] bosom of Abraham.
[34:38] [music]
[34:38] And although he was poor
[34:42] in heaven, I'm sure
[34:46] that there's not a rich man.
[34:50] [music]
[34:52] Cuz it don't take this world's
[34:55] possessions. [music]
[34:58] No [singing] money that I'll have to
[35:02] pay.
[35:04] [music]
[35:05] It just took the blood
[35:08] of God's only [singing and music] son to
[35:12] wash all my sins away.
[35:17] And I don't have [music] much longer to
[35:21] stay here.
[35:24] My race [music] is almost run.
[35:30] And [music] Lord, you know
[35:34] I've seen better days, but the best is
[35:38] [music and singing] yet to come.
[35:43] [music]
[35:53] [music]
[35:56] My pockets aren't filled with money
[36:01] and I [music] don't wear the ladies
[36:05] styles.
[36:08] And the house [music] that I live in is
[36:12] old and run down. But that's all right.
[36:16] It'll do [music] for a while
[36:21] cuz soon I'll inherit a mansion
[36:24] [singing]
[36:25] [music]
[36:26] that never
[36:29] will decay.
[36:32] And [music and singing] I'll wear a
[36:34] white robe and a crown of glory that
[36:39] faded [music] not away.
[36:45] Cuz it don't take this world's
[36:48] possessions. [music]
[36:51] No money that I'll [singing] have to
[36:55] pay.
[36:58] It just [music]
[36:59] took the blood
[37:01] of God's only son to wash all my [music]
[37:06] sins away.
[37:09] And I don't have much longer to stay
[37:14] here.
[37:16] My race is almost [singing]
[37:19] [music]
[37:20] run.
[37:22] And Lord, you know I've seen
[37:26] [music and singing]
[37:26] better days, but the best is yet to
[37:31] come.
[37:33] [music]
[37:34] And Lord, you know I've seen [singing]
[37:38] better days, but the best [music] is yet
[37:43] to come.
[37:49] [applause and music]
[37:58] How many's ready for the word?
[38:00] Amen. Let us stand. Amen.
[38:03] I want to greet all the guests again.
[38:06] Amen. Greetings. Now, there's a rule.
[38:09] The first time that you're here, [music]
[38:11] you're guest. The second time, your
[38:14] family. Amen. Amen. Let's give the Lord
[38:18] one more hand. Amen.
[38:20] [music and applause]
[38:21] Hearts and minds ready for the word.
[38:23] Amen.
[38:25] Amen. This because he lives, I can face
[38:28] tomorrow.
[38:33] God sent his son.
[38:40] They called him Jesus.
[38:47] He [music]
[38:48] [singing] came to love,
[38:54] heal, and forive.
[39:01] He bled and died
[39:08] to
[39:10] [music]
[39:15] and [music]
[39:17] grave
[39:22] my savior
[39:24] lives.
[39:28] [music]
[39:29] Because
[39:30] he lives,
[39:35] I give [music] face to
[39:42] [music]
[39:45] lives.
[39:49] All fear is gone [music]
[39:55] because I know
[40:01] [music] he holds my [singing]
[40:09] life
[40:17] [music]
[40:18] Heat. Heat.
[40:24] [music and singing]
[40:32] [music]
[40:34] That's right.
[40:37] [music]
[40:45] [music]
[40:50] I [music] know. Oh, yes. I know.
[40:56] I
[40:58] [music]
[41:00] now
[41:04] [music]
[41:08] [singing]
[41:10] [music]
[41:13] give the Lord a hand this morning.
[41:14] Hallelujah. [music]
[41:17] [applause] Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[41:20] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[41:22] Amen.
[41:23] God bless you all. Smiling faces and
[41:25] enjoying all that worship in the back.
[41:27] Enjoy all those specials. Amen. Praise
[41:30] God. We're going to invite you right to
[41:32] the book of Hebrews, chapter 12 this
[41:34] morning. Amen. Glad to be in the house
[41:36] of God on a beautiful sunny Sunday.
[41:39] Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. Enjoying
[41:41] all of these uh wonderful songs. My just
[41:44] such a treat for me in the back. And
[41:47] Amen. And I I get to hear it right when
[41:48] I walk in the side door. I could hear
[41:50] Anthony back there with his band. They
[41:52] were jumping and it was sounding good.
[41:54] [laughter]
[41:56] And then um Amen. I was able to uh catch
[41:58] brother Jason Sunday school from the
[42:01] back. I think it's quite a profound
[42:03] thought. My I I I I thought to myself,
[42:06] JD, as you were the way you go about it,
[42:10] I it made me think about the I don't
[42:13] remember if it's in the um I think it's
[42:16] like on the back of the book where other
[42:18] people write about this person who wrote
[42:20] the book. And if you go I think it's I
[42:24] know it's the book Christ the Healer.
[42:26] And I think that one of the things on
[42:28] the back that some other minister, some
[42:30] renowned man of that of that era, he
[42:33] said, he said to the effect, he said,
[42:35] "Brother Bosworth has made this topic of
[42:39] divine healing so tight, it's just so
[42:43] proven, there's no way anyone, he just
[42:47] has went over the top with it. There's
[42:49] no way anyone could refute it." Amen.
[42:52] Not with your Not with your Bible,
[42:53] anyway. Praise the Lord. Amen. So, I I
[42:56] was thinking about that, Brother Jay, as
[42:58] you were covering that so thoroughly,
[43:00] back and forth, back and forth, back and
[43:02] forth, not afraid to take on the
[43:05] challenges and the questions that you
[43:07] you see in the world today. Just taking
[43:08] them head on. Amen. I think that that's
[43:11] magnificent. Amen. Hebrews chapter 12.
[43:14] Hebrews [clears throat] chapter 12. The
[43:16] time of the unsealing part eight
[43:20] won't get finished. Already know it.
[43:24] Oh, well, so so much for numericics, but
[43:27] anyway, we're just going to carry on uh
[43:31] in the Lord and carry on with whatever
[43:32] the Lord has for us. Amen. You love the
[43:35] word. It's been a great thrill to me to
[43:38] have this series because it's such a my
[43:42] such a monumental moment that we have
[43:45] arrived at in human history as the Bible
[43:48] refers to the there's a generation upon
[43:51] whom the ends of the earth have come and
[43:53] we believe that we are that generation.
[43:56] We believe it because God has sent a
[43:57] message that he promised he would send
[44:00] right at that time
[44:02] and we have that and so we're very much
[44:06] thrilled with that this morning. Amen.
[44:08] Visi u greetings to our visitors in the
[44:10] back there. God bless you. We're happy
[44:12] to have you all here today. Amen.
[44:14] Hebrews chapter 12 um verse one. I'm not
[44:18] going to keep you standing for the whole
[44:19] reading because we're going to read
[44:20] pretty much that entire chapter. But
[44:23] let's just catch a little bit. I'm going
[44:24] to let you be seated.
[44:30] Wherefore, seeing we also are compassed
[44:33] about with so great a cloud of
[44:35] witnesses,
[44:36] let us lay aside every weight and the
[44:40] sin which doth so easily beset us, and
[44:43] let us run with patience the race that
[44:46] is set before us. Do you find it amazing
[44:49] that Paul would need to say that to
[44:52] believers?
[44:54] He's not, this isn't a this isn't a an
[44:57] outreach campaign where they're in the
[45:00] hedges and highways. He's talking to his
[45:02] own countrymen who have believed on the
[45:04] Lord. And he's saying, since we are
[45:07] compassed about with so great a cloud of
[45:10] witnesses, let us lay aside every weight
[45:12] and the sin which doth so easily. Can
[45:16] you imagine that can be true about
[45:17] believers?
[45:19] So easily beset us. And let us run with
[45:22] patience the race that is set before us,
[45:24] looking unto Jesus, the author and
[45:27] finisher of our faith, who for the joy
[45:30] that was set before him endured the
[45:33] cross, [clears throat]
[45:35] despising the shame, and is sat down at
[45:39] the right hand of the throne of God. For
[45:43] consider him that endured such
[45:45] contradiction of sinners against
[45:47] himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in
[45:50] your minds. Ye have not yet resisted
[45:53] unto blood, striving against sin. This
[45:56] is my favorite passage to go to when I
[45:58] find people in a pity party.
[46:01] My favorite one. This is like knocks
[46:04] them out. It's right between the eyes.
[46:07] You haven't yet suffered under blood.
[46:10] You know, many have. Many millions have.
[46:14] You haven't.
[46:15] So get over yourself.
[46:17] Stand up. Dust yourself off. God still
[46:20] loves you.
[46:21] Don't think of trials, even the fiery
[46:24] ones,
[46:25] as strange. They're for your good.
[46:28] So press on.
[46:31] Get back in line. Get back in step.
[46:33] Press on.
[46:35] All right. Think about him who endured
[46:38] such a well, they did me wrong. Think
[46:40] about what a contradiction that Jesus
[46:44] accepted on himself. The perfectly
[46:46] innocent
[46:47] being condemned by the totally guilty.
[46:50] You talking about being done wrong. Wow.
[46:54] So [clears throat] verse five. And you
[46:56] have forgotten the exhortation which
[46:58] speaketh unto you as unto children. My
[47:00] son, despise not thou the chastening of
[47:02] the Lord, nor faint when thou art
[47:05] rebuked of him. For whom the Lord
[47:08] loveth, he chastineth, and scourgeth
[47:10] every son whom he receiveth. If he
[47:12] endure chastening, God deleth with you
[47:15] as with sons. For what son is he whom
[47:19] the father chastineth not? All right.
[47:23] But if you be without chastisement,
[47:25] whereof all are partakers, then you're
[47:28] bastards and not sons. Furthermore, we
[47:31] have had we have had fathers of our
[47:34] flesh which corrected us, and we gave
[47:37] them reverence. Shall we not much rather
[47:40] be in subjection unto the father of
[47:42] spirits and live? That's a pretty good
[47:44] reward, isn't it?
[47:45] Amen.
[47:46] For verily for a few days
[47:49] uh for a few days chastening for they
[47:52] verily for a few days chasened us after
[47:55] their own pleasure. But in other words,
[47:57] how they thought best. didn't always get
[47:59] it right. Amen. I'm a dad. I know I
[48:01] didn't get always get it right. Glad my
[48:04] boys still love me. Amen.
[48:07] [clears throat]
[48:07] Amen. No, their wives are saying, "Oh,
[48:10] they deserved it."
[48:12] Amen.
[48:14] Now, no chastening. Here's a here's a a
[48:17] common sense thing. Now, no chastening
[48:19] for the present seemth to be joyous.
[48:22] Paul understands you're a human. He
[48:25] understands suffering is real and
[48:27] sadness and sorrow. It's not that we
[48:30] don't sorrow. We just don't sorrow as
[48:32] the world who has no hope. See, so he
[48:36] says, he says, "Now, no chastening for
[48:39] the present seemth to be joyous, but
[48:41] grievious. Nevertheless, that
[48:44] notwithstanding, I'm not denying that
[48:46] that's true. However, afterward, it
[48:49] yieldeth the peaceable fruit of
[48:51] righteousness unto them which are
[48:53] exercised thereby.
[48:56] Wherefore, because of this, having known
[48:59] this, now that you get it, lift up holy
[49:02] hands which hang down, and the feeble
[49:05] knees, and make here here's a lesson.
[49:08] Make straight paths for your feet. I'm
[49:11] tired of getting chastised. Make
[49:12] straight paths.
[49:15] Amen. Man, I was talking to a sister the
[49:16] other day and I said, "Look, sis, here's
[49:18] a here's a lesson, life lesson for you.
[49:21] The quickest way to a trial or a test is
[49:24] fail one.
[49:27] I promise you'll get it again
[49:29] and again
[49:30] and again and again until you pass it."
[49:34] See, so make straight paths for your
[49:38] feet, lest that which is lame be turned
[49:40] out of the way, but but let it rather be
[49:43] healed. Let it allow it. Permit it to
[49:46] be.
[49:47] You have to do that. You have to allow
[49:49] the word to dwell in you richly. You
[49:51] have to let the mind which was in Christ
[49:54] be in you. You have to uh you know allow
[49:57] yourself to look from his perspective.
[50:00] Amen.
[50:01] Amen.
[50:04] Make straight paths for your feet lest
[50:06] that which is lame be turned out of the
[50:08] way, but let it rather be healed.
[50:11] have a number of prayer requests I want
[50:13] to pray for. Um, brother Chris St. John
[50:16] was sick today. Brother Brad has been
[50:18] sick. Brother Bradley, he came actually
[50:20] I met him. He was coming in the parking
[50:22] lot. He come in, felt too bad. Went home
[50:24] to lay down his streaming today. Sister
[50:26] Kathy still recovering. Brother Jack.
[50:28] Amen. And um and uh seemed like I had uh
[50:31] one more. Um let me see who it was.
[50:36] Um
[50:40] yes uh Sister Amber um she's still
[50:46] devil's still attacking her. So we're
[50:48] praying for that as well. Uh we've had a
[50:50] wonderful time in the men's Thursday
[50:54] night prayer meeting. Brothers, that has
[50:57] been a wonderful thing, hasn't it? I
[50:59] tell you that has that has done so much
[51:01] for my heart. We were gathered, a
[51:03] good-sized group of us here were
[51:05] gathered Thursday night and we were
[51:06] praying and we got a text from a sister
[51:10] uh who streams us from California and
[51:13] has rededicated her heart to the Lord
[51:16] and streams us and she sent in a prayer
[51:18] request. Brother Jason, I was just
[51:21] praying for the brothers at the Thursday
[51:25] night prayer meeting and I want to put
[51:27] in my request and every one of us, all
[51:30] of us men, we had to fight back tears to
[51:32] thank here's a lady in California who's
[51:35] just streaming and and it's on her heart
[51:37] to get down and pray for the brothers
[51:40] who are gathering on Thursday night. Oh
[51:43] my, it just thrilled me so much. Amen.
[51:46] So, let's take these requests to the
[51:48] Lord and uh ask for his blessing.
[51:50] Father, we thank you for your love and
[51:53] your kindness to us. Lord God, I thank
[51:56] you for your word that's been read now.
[51:58] We know there's a blessing in reading it
[52:00] and a blessing in hearing it read. We
[52:02] know your word is already anointed. It's
[52:04] we Lord who need thy anointing. I pray
[52:07] that you will bless speaker and hearer
[52:09] Lord as we speak from our heart today
[52:12] and [clears throat] give it give it Lord
[52:14] may I give it uh in the way that I
[52:16] received it and let it flow me taking no
[52:20] thought Lord not not to avoid my
[52:22] preparation but no thought of how I'm
[52:25] going to make it go or how far I'm going
[52:27] to go I want you to be in control of
[52:29] that Lord I commit it to you master
[52:32] these sick and afflicted among us Lord
[52:34] we re ask you to remember them
[52:36] especially right now that you would
[52:38] speed healing Lord into their bodies. We
[52:41] commit it to you now in Jesus name.
[52:44] Amen. God bless you as you're seated.
[52:46] [clears throat]
[53:01] Oh, so brother Donald, I'm sorry, Deb. I
[53:03] didn't see that in time. Brother Donald
[53:05] at home not feeling well also. Let's uh
[53:08] be remembering him apparently. Um so the
[53:12] um brother Luther, I guess the basket's
[53:15] just at the back. Uh you didn't they
[53:17] didn't call you forward um to make you
[53:19] round. So God bless you. That's all
[53:21] right. Um yes, thank you. Um
[53:25] we want to just be praying for uh
[53:27] William. Y'all remember William. He's
[53:30] almost like a fourth son to me. Has been
[53:32] for years. called me dad for years. And
[53:34] uh he he has visited quite a bit. And uh
[53:38] his mother, Sister Connie, who also many
[53:40] of us know went on to her reward to be
[53:43] with the Lord. You know, uh we're not
[53:45] sad for her. Uh happy days for her. My
[53:49] but uh you know, we want to be praying
[53:51] for William and for brother Wayne at
[53:53] this time and that family. Lord, keep
[53:56] them very near. Amen. [clears throat]
[54:00] All right. So
[54:02] looking now from our from our text,
[54:05] let's go back and let's finish reading
[54:08] from verse uh 15 or verse 14, I'm sorry.
[54:14] Follow peace with all men and holiness
[54:17] without which no man shall see the Lord.
[54:21] always puzzles me that at every
[54:24] Hollywood funeral, uh, they've got the
[54:28] people who live the most adulterous, um,
[54:32] you know, low moral lifestyle and
[54:36] they're all in heaven
[54:38] looking down. To which I go, "Wow, I'd
[54:42] like to hope that, but I mean, what
[54:44] about what about this?
[54:46] That without holiness, no man shall see
[54:48] God." And I'm sorry, but there there's
[54:52] not going to be like the world thinks.
[54:55] An angel stepping out on a cloud blowing
[54:58] a trumpet. An es golden escalator drops
[55:01] down. Jesus descends like Donald Trump
[55:04] and takes us all home.
[55:07] Takes the whole world home. Oh, we're
[55:09] all going home now. That's not going to
[55:11] happen. That's a fairy tale. Yes. Amen.
[55:14] First of all, the rapture is a secret
[55:16] happening that the world's unaware even
[55:18] happening until after the fact.
[55:20] We're gone for quite a while before the
[55:22] foolish virgin even realized we're gone.
[55:24] Amen. So, so we realize that without
[55:27] holiness, no man shall see the Lord.
[55:30] Looking diligently, lest any man fail of
[55:34] the grace of God, lest any root of
[55:36] bitterness spring up trouble you. This
[55:37] is to believers. and thereby many be
[55:40] defiled, lest there be any fornicator or
[55:43] profane person as Esau, who for one
[55:45] morsel of meat sold his birthright, for
[55:47] you know how that afterward, when he
[55:50] would have inherited the blessing, he
[55:52] was rejected, for he found no place of
[55:54] repentance. Catch it, though he sought
[55:57] it carefully with tears.
[55:58] Amen.
[56:00] You see, so in order to repent, the the
[56:02] door of repentance has to be opened to
[56:04] you.
[56:05] You can't just decide to love God. The
[56:08] love of God has to be poured into your
[56:10] heart by the Holy Ghost.
[56:11] You can't just decide, I'm gonna I'm
[56:13] gonna go to heaven. You don't. That that
[56:16] doesn't work. You have to be first
[56:18] invited. Say, well, Jesus invited the
[56:20] whole world. Well, he died for the whole
[56:21] world.
[56:22] And every man does get a does have an
[56:24] opportunity to give his heart to the
[56:26] Lord and accept the free pardon. Uh but
[56:29] but you have to remember that, you know,
[56:32] you do have to accept it. A pardon's not
[56:34] a pardon unless it's accepted as that.
[56:36] And then when you repent, that means you
[56:38] turn your life around. That means you
[56:40] don't live the same kind of life
[56:42] anymore. You're a new creation. So he
[56:44] says here, now watch,
[56:47] though he sought it carefully with
[56:49] tears, for ye are not come unto mount
[56:51] unto the mount that might be touched and
[56:53] that burned with fire. This is Sinai.
[56:55] nor under blackness and darkness and
[56:57] tempest, and the sound of a trumpet, and
[57:00] the voice of words, which voice they
[57:02] that heard intreated, that the word
[57:04] should not be spoken to them anymore.
[57:07] For they could not endure that which was
[57:09] commanded. And if so much as a beast
[57:11] touched the mountain, it shall be stoned
[57:14] or thrust through with a dart.
[57:18] So terrible was the sight that Moses
[57:21] said, "I exceedingly fear and quake.
[57:24] You're not you're not come to that
[57:25] mountain. Verse 22. But ye are come unto
[57:28] Mount Zion, and unto the city of the
[57:32] living God, the heavenly Jerusalem. Now,
[57:35] you'll notice there's a difference in
[57:36] the language here between Hebrews 12 and
[57:41] Revelation 21 where in in there you have
[57:45] a a holy uh Jerusalem. Here you you find
[57:49] him saying this is the heavenly
[57:51] Jerusalem but there it's a holy
[57:54] Jerusalem because there's John said
[57:56] there was no temple there. See because
[57:59] the lamb and the light are the are the
[58:01] lamb is the light thereof. And we find
[58:04] that the that the temple is God's family
[58:08] him dwelling in them. That's why when
[58:10] John was told by the angel holding one
[58:13] holding that seventh vial, "Come and
[58:15] I'll show you the bride, the lamb's
[58:17] wife." Well, when he took him to show
[58:19] him the bride, the lamb's wife, he saw
[58:20] the city.
[58:22] See, so that's that's holy Jerusalem.
[58:25] Why? This is heavenly Jerusalem that
[58:27] which you are already seated together in
[58:30] heavenly places in Christ Jesus. Here
[58:32] here's how you know it. This is the
[58:34] heavenly Jerusalem. Verse 23, to the
[58:37] general assembly and church of the
[58:39] firstborn, which are written in heaven,
[58:41] and to God the judge of all, and to the
[58:43] spirits of just men made perfect, and to
[58:46] Jesus the mediator of the new covenant,
[58:48] and to the blood of sprinkling, that
[58:50] speaketh better things than that of
[58:52] Abel. See that you refuse not him that
[58:56] speaketh. For if they escaped not who
[58:59] refused him that spake on earth, much
[59:01] more shall we shall not we escape if we
[59:06] turn away from him that speaketh from
[59:08] heaven. Whose voice then shook the
[59:11] earth. All right, that was Sinai. But
[59:13] now he hath promised, saying, yet once
[59:16] more I shake not the earth only, but
[59:19] also heaven. And this word yet once more
[59:23] signifth. Here's what it means by saying
[59:26] yet once more. It means that there's a
[59:28] removing of those things that are shaken
[59:32] as of things that are made. That those
[59:34] things which cannot be shaken may
[59:37] remain.
[59:38] Amen.
[59:39] And that's what you find in a new
[59:41] heavens and a new earth once you break
[59:44] into Revelation chapter 21. Now it's
[59:48] making uh it's describing God dealing
[59:51] being with mankind in a way that it has
[59:54] never been before in all the Bible that
[59:57] it says God himself will dwell with men.
[1:00:01] So he's not coming to dwell in an
[1:00:03] office. He's always dwelt in an office.
[1:00:06] But this is now God tabernacling
[1:00:09] himself in his family. See? And so we're
[1:00:13] with Jesus who's the beginning of this
[1:00:15] new family and the pillar of fire above
[1:00:18] him. That doesn't make a second God or a
[1:00:21] third God. That means it's the one God
[1:00:23] above all, through all and in you all.
[1:00:26] Amen.
[1:00:28] And that's what we're coming to. That's
[1:00:30] the surrendering of the kingdom. Say for
[1:00:32] brother Jay was dealing with that uh
[1:00:34] Wednesday. The surrendering of the
[1:00:36] kingdom. The son surrenders up the
[1:00:38] kingdom to the father. That doesn't make
[1:00:40] two lords. That's an incorrect doctrine.
[1:00:43] That's what it is is a surrendering of
[1:00:45] the office. Now it's God. [screaming]
[1:00:47] God himself shall dwell with men. And
[1:00:50] there was no temple there because why?
[1:00:52] You are the temple.
[1:00:54] You say, "How did I get there?
[1:00:55] [screaming] You're being built into it
[1:00:56] now. You're lively stones.
[1:00:59] You're being fashioned and crafted by
[1:01:01] the word of God. No wonder only the
[1:01:05] bride goes in the rapture because she is
[1:01:08] a word bride. She's not a denominational
[1:01:12] theory. She's not a concept. She's not
[1:01:15] something that that uh that 33,000
[1:01:19] different denominations said was the
[1:01:21] bride. There's been [screaming] brides,
[1:01:23] brides, churches, churches, brides,
[1:01:25] churches, brides. But at the end, there
[1:01:27] had to come a real one.
[1:01:30] That's the promise in the Bible that at
[1:01:33] the last day there would be a real one
[1:01:35] in the earth. Should be a very small
[1:01:36] number. And God would send a message
[1:01:39] with a messenger with a message that
[1:01:41] would call her [screaming] out of the
[1:01:42] church
[1:01:44] and and and dress her in the garments of
[1:01:47] the word and she it is who will receive
[1:01:50] the sleeping saints.
[1:01:52] She alone
[1:01:56] and the world will spin off into chaos.
[1:02:00] So this is why verse 28 is so vital.
[1:02:07] Amen.
[1:02:08] Wherefore, in other words, having said
[1:02:11] everything that I just said, this is
[1:02:13] Paul now, having said everything that I
[1:02:17] just said to you about, you know, trials
[1:02:21] and tribulations come for your good, set
[1:02:22] straight paths before your feet. See,
[1:02:26] you you're not come to Sinai anymore.
[1:02:28] You're not coming to something some
[1:02:30] man-made. That that whole law was never
[1:02:32] that was not God's plan. That was the
[1:02:34] people's plan. They wanted that. They
[1:02:37] already had the pillar of fire. Why
[1:02:39] would you want a law? They had the they
[1:02:41] had the prophet. They had the pillar of
[1:02:43] fire. Why would What would you want with
[1:02:45] a man-made system that you can't keep
[1:02:47] anyway?
[1:02:49] See,
[1:02:50] and so you know, but he's saying we're
[1:02:53] not doing that again. The New Testament
[1:02:56] era is not going to be about that. God
[1:02:58] is the Holy Ghost isn't coming to give
[1:03:01] control of the church to groups of men
[1:03:04] or women. He's coming to be the head of
[1:03:07] his own church.
[1:03:09] Amen.
[1:03:09] And he draws her aside by the word of
[1:03:11] God. Wherefore we receive a kingdom,
[1:03:15] there it is. A kingdom which cannot be
[1:03:18] moved. Let us have grace whereby we may
[1:03:20] serve God acceptably with reverence and
[1:03:22] godly fear. So we receive a kingdom.
[1:03:26] That's why it's now God in in the new
[1:03:30] heavens in the new earth after the
[1:03:31] millennium after the devil's been
[1:03:33] destroyed. Death and hell have been cast
[1:03:35] into the lake of fire. There's nothing
[1:03:37] evil. All evil people, all evil demons,
[1:03:40] all the evil devil. They've all been
[1:03:42] annihilated.
[1:03:44] See, as as brother Jason was showing
[1:03:46] this morning, only God can do that. See,
[1:03:48] because don't forget Lucifer has a soul.
[1:03:50] It's what made him a free moral agent.
[1:03:53] Right? And so God will destroy him and
[1:03:55] death and hell and the false prophet.
[1:03:57] And everything is cast in the lake of
[1:03:58] fire, after the judgment, which is after
[1:04:00] the millennium, which is after the
[1:04:02] tribulation, which is after we leave.
[1:04:04] Amen.
[1:04:05] Like like dominoes going in reverse. But
[1:04:08] they're going to go this way. And I'm
[1:04:10] here to tell you, once once Revelation
[1:04:12] chapter 21 breaks open, everything God
[1:04:16] at that time fills all time, space, and
[1:04:19] eternity. Everything in existence is a
[1:04:22] pure expression of him. And and and and
[1:04:25] he is a pure expression of everything
[1:04:27] that's in existence.
[1:04:29] Amen.
[1:04:29] What a day that will be.
[1:04:32] That's a kingdom. That's a kingdom
[1:04:34] coming. We are here today preparing for
[1:04:37] that kingdom.
[1:04:39] If you want to go,
[1:04:42] do you want to go?
[1:04:45] Good news. [screaming] I got a road map
[1:04:46] today.
[1:04:47] Good news. I got coordinates,
[1:04:50] good news. You can you can meet and and
[1:04:52] you say, "Where where where does the
[1:04:54] road begin?" You know, in in Bunan's
[1:04:56] story of the pilgrim's progress, it
[1:04:59] began at the wicked gate. I'm here to
[1:05:01] tell you, it begins at Calvary.
[1:05:03] And from there, it just goes on and on
[1:05:05] [screaming] and on and on till one day,
[1:05:08] we're going to stand with glorified
[1:05:09] bodies like he has.
[1:05:16] We have showed you in the past and I'm
[1:05:18] going to really pace myself on time
[1:05:20] because I'm not trying to get finished.
[1:05:22] I'm just going to watch the clock and go
[1:05:24] to a to a if you would just give me your
[1:05:26] undivided attention 55 60 minutes. Uh
[1:05:30] I'm going to try to stop because I
[1:05:31] suffered quite a bit from last Sunday.
[1:05:34] It was a joyful suffering. I was smiling
[1:05:35] but I was also hurting. Amen. is, you
[1:05:38] know, gave me a chance to get at the
[1:05:40] devil. I like it. I hate that guy.
[1:05:45] I want to kill him.
[1:05:47] I want I want the Lord to kill him and I
[1:05:49] want to watch.
[1:05:51] Amen.
[1:05:53] If you if you've been around the world
[1:05:55] as I have and seen the suffering I've
[1:05:57] seen over decades, you'd be wanting to
[1:06:00] stand at the edge of the of the pit,
[1:06:01] too.
[1:06:02] You'd be wanting to stand right there,
[1:06:04] toss him.
[1:06:06] Amen.
[1:06:07] Oh my. Hey, you say that's that's
[1:06:10] sadistic. The Bible says that all heaven
[1:06:14] was rejoicing
[1:06:16] and the word of God says rejoice.
[1:06:18] Hallelujah. [screaming] For your enemies
[1:06:20] destroyed
[1:06:21] and they they worshiped God because he
[1:06:24] had destroyed the devil.
[1:06:26] Hallelujah. My they were celebrating it.
[1:06:30] So we find that God is a consuming fire.
[1:06:36] So we have talked to you in times past
[1:06:38] of how when we're talking about the
[1:06:40] operation of the kingdom, the operation
[1:06:42] of the kingdom is the operation of third
[1:06:44] pull. For us at this stage, it's a
[1:06:46] coming kingdom. It's a coming world.
[1:06:48] What are we doing here? How do we get
[1:06:49] there? God has sent a message that went
[1:06:51] through three pools and we are coming to
[1:06:54] that third one. We are in it. That is
[1:06:56] the opening of the word. We have been in
[1:06:57] it since the day when the seven seals
[1:06:59] were broken and loosed to us. And we are
[1:07:02] now uh uh eating our way to a body
[1:07:05] change as it were. You can see as as
[1:07:08] brother Brandon would say that he he hid
[1:07:10] it all through the Bible taught us that
[1:07:13] it wasn't written but it was he did he
[1:07:15] didn't show it but he did show it
[1:07:17] in the lives of the people and we
[1:07:19] started back with Abraham and we showed
[1:07:21] you there was no difference in a prophet
[1:07:23] in the woods saying a squirrel will be
[1:07:25] here or Abraham saying that that the the
[1:07:29] Lord shall provide a lamb.
[1:07:31] And it that was impossible. And Abraham
[1:07:34] didn't take one with him, but he spoke.
[1:07:37] And and and lo and behold, maybe even
[1:07:39] Abraham didn't even know. I'm here to
[1:07:41] tell you something, friends. I'm not
[1:07:43] here to tell you you're always going to
[1:07:44] be aware of it. But if if your life is
[1:07:47] dedicated to God, and you're living, as
[1:07:49] a prophet said, in those spheres with
[1:07:51] God, and you're totally sold out,
[1:07:53] whatever you face, there's going to be a
[1:07:55] word that's going to come through you,
[1:07:57] and you'll say, "Oh, that was me." And
[1:07:58] it's not going to be you. It's going to
[1:08:00] be him.
[1:08:02] Amen.
[1:08:04] See, and so this this this was seen
[1:08:07] there because that's Genesis 1 power.
[1:08:10] Jesus didn't even operate that. He had
[1:08:12] that power, but he never operated it. He
[1:08:15] always made something from something. He
[1:08:17] never created something out of thin air.
[1:08:19] He hadn't done that since he created the
[1:08:21] world, the heavens and the earth, which
[1:08:22] Ephesians shows us that it was all
[1:08:24] created and done by Jesus Christ. so
[1:08:27] long before his he was born of a woman.
[1:08:30] So we find out then that he was the
[1:08:33] genesis of the spoken word
[1:08:36] and that he's he shows a demonstration
[1:08:38] of it in Abraham. And then and then this
[1:08:42] is exactly one of the reasons why Jesus
[1:08:45] said as it was in the days of Lot and in
[1:08:48] the days of Noah. Now notice he didn't
[1:08:50] say in the days of Abraham or in the
[1:08:52] days of Enoch because that's God's
[1:08:55] family. He's the warning in Matthew in
[1:08:58] in Luke 17 and Matthew 24 is warnings of
[1:09:01] the wickedness of the end time. And
[1:09:03] here's what you want to be on the
[1:09:05] lookout for. When you see the evil of
[1:09:07] Lot's day and the evil of Noah's day,
[1:09:10] then understand that Enoch was already
[1:09:12] on the scene and there's already a
[1:09:13] capstone.
[1:09:15] There's already a visitation. By the
[1:09:18] time Lot uh by the time Sodom is
[1:09:20] destroyed, Abraham has already met
[1:09:23] Melzdc
[1:09:25] and he's already done the impossible in
[1:09:28] Abraham's life.
[1:09:30] And I just say, Lord, that's what I
[1:09:33] need.
[1:09:34] I need you to do what seems to be
[1:09:37] impossible for me. I have fought all my
[1:09:40] life since uh to to try to be a a live a
[1:09:43] life worthy of the gospel. And it just
[1:09:46] seems so impossible to meet it
[1:09:48] perfectly. To meet it perfectly. I get
[1:09:50] close and then I stumble and I get close
[1:09:52] and I stumble. But I mean I'm looking
[1:09:54] for a faith that's going to do the
[1:09:56] impossible.
[1:09:58] Amen.
[1:09:59] It literally produced in Abraham a mind
[1:10:02] beyond himself.
[1:10:05] You know the faith of Abraham can raise
[1:10:06] the dead. Did you know that?
[1:10:09] That's exactly if you go to the uh to
[1:10:13] the to the rich young ruler and he
[1:10:15] lifted up his head his eyes in hell.
[1:10:17] What a picture. I'd never thought about
[1:10:18] it till brother Jason pointed out the
[1:10:20] other night. Imagine imagine the agony
[1:10:23] of being able to see over into the
[1:10:24] paradise and you're in this torment and
[1:10:26] there's a he said I oh s he said there's
[1:10:29] a great gulf fixed between us and you
[1:10:31] can't come here and we can't come there.
[1:10:33] And he says well then send Lazarus back.
[1:10:35] So he had he had faith that Abraham
[1:10:38] could raise the dead.
[1:10:39] Yeah.
[1:10:39] Father Abraham, send him back. He's
[1:10:41] dead. But father but your father
[1:10:44] Abraham, you've got you've got the power
[1:10:46] of the spoken word.
[1:10:48] Oh, you [screaming] you've already
[1:10:49] you've met the king of Salem.
[1:10:50] Hallelujah.
[1:10:52] You already are familiar with speaking
[1:10:55] that which is impossible.
[1:10:58] See, so it's pretty good to be a child
[1:11:00] of Abraham.
[1:11:01] Amen.
[1:11:02] If you've got the same faith of Abraham,
[1:11:05] because it's a faith from somewhere
[1:11:07] beyond himself. And that's really the
[1:11:08] key. This is really the beauty of Mark
[1:11:11] 11 that Abraham didn't have to know how
[1:11:13] it would go, but but he could exercise
[1:11:17] uh his perfect faith and declare. And it
[1:11:20] turned out to be the voice of the Lord
[1:11:22] speaking through him in creation. You
[1:11:24] know what it did? It met his need. And
[1:11:28] and I want to say it this way.
[1:11:31] It met his need, the greatest need he
[1:11:33] would ever face.
[1:11:35] I mean, think of what he's on his way to
[1:11:37] do.
[1:11:38] Waited 24 25 years to get this son and
[1:11:42] then gets to half raise him only now to
[1:11:45] sacrifice him. You're talking about a
[1:11:48] need. You think you got a need? No. You
[1:11:50] ain't had a need like that.
[1:11:52] I'm here to tell you something, friends.
[1:11:53] You are just be glad and rejoice. I
[1:11:55] wouldn't have wanted to been Abraham
[1:11:56] facing that. Oh my. But it not only met
[1:12:00] his need. The word that catch it now. I
[1:12:02] want you to catch this. The the word
[1:12:04] that he spoke wasn't his own. That was
[1:12:07] God speaking through a vessel so
[1:12:10] surrendered that he was willing to take
[1:12:11] his child, his only child
[1:12:14] as far as God was concerned, and
[1:12:16] sacrificing.
[1:12:17] That's surrender.
[1:12:19] Amen.
[1:12:19] That's your model.
[1:12:21] That's your road map. That's the kind of
[1:12:23] sincerity that operates the third pull
[1:12:25] today. Don't don't misunderstand. You're
[1:12:28] not going to just sit in a message
[1:12:30] church and say, "I believe God sent a
[1:12:32] prophet." And, "Well, the devil does,
[1:12:33] too." "Well, I believe it's true." Well,
[1:12:34] so does the devil. Oh, I I believe in
[1:12:37] God. So does the devil. I believe the
[1:12:38] Bible. So does the devil.
[1:12:40] You understand? But but but but we don't
[1:12:43] find Satan operating creative power. We
[1:12:45] find God's family doing that.
[1:12:48] And what was and what was it? Because of
[1:12:50] the sincerity and the dedication and the
[1:12:53] total surrender and the total
[1:12:55] commitment,
[1:12:57] Abraham was fully committed.
[1:13:00] So the word that he spoke not only met
[1:13:03] the need that he had, but it also met
[1:13:06] the need of the word to manifest. See,
[1:13:09] because the word has a need. I mean the
[1:13:12] whole reason we have creation is because
[1:13:15] God wanted to express himself alone with
[1:13:18] his thoughts was not tenable. He didn't
[1:13:21] want to be that. He had been that in the
[1:13:23] eternities. So he creates angels and
[1:13:25] they start to worship him and now he
[1:13:27] becomes an object of worship. And then
[1:13:29] he he he he he starts creating heavens
[1:13:31] and earth. He and he's all doing all of
[1:13:34] that in the office of sunship. And he's
[1:13:35] he's he's moved himself into the pillar
[1:13:38] of fire. And now he's creating. And now
[1:13:40] he's got a earth. And now he's dressed
[1:13:42] it, made a garden, and put his son and
[1:13:44] his son's wife there. And now he's got
[1:13:46] future plans of a of a family and a
[1:13:48] whole economy and and a whole
[1:13:50] civilization, a universal [screaming]
[1:13:53] universewide civilization. I'm here to
[1:13:56] tell you, the universe we live in is a
[1:13:58] is a little pepper speck compared to his
[1:14:01] plans. [screaming]
[1:14:03] Yeah.
[1:14:04] Oh my. No wonder Paul could say, "You've
[1:14:06] never imagined what it's going to be.
[1:14:08] It's too much. Do you imagine? You don't
[1:14:10] have the You'll blow fuses. You don't
[1:14:12] have the wiring for it."
[1:14:14] But the word had a need to manifest. Why
[1:14:19] does God
[1:14:21] meet you here in church and you've taken
[1:14:25] the time to get up and get dressed and
[1:14:29] burn gas and dress your family and go
[1:14:32] through the vexations of all of that and
[1:14:34] get them to church and come into a
[1:14:36] building of your own vition and sit down
[1:14:40] and give some money
[1:14:42] and clap and sing for God to send a
[1:14:44] [screaming] crazy man out here and tell
[1:14:46] you you need to repent. And you need to
[1:14:48] have more sincerity.
[1:14:51] Who thought up this model?
[1:14:54] No wonder it's called the foolishness of
[1:14:56] preaching. But why do you keep coming
[1:14:58] back? You love pain. No, you [screaming]
[1:15:00] love the word.
[1:15:02] Why do you put up with it? Why do you ha
[1:15:03] why are you willing to take it and and
[1:15:05] not only take it but to say me more,
[1:15:07] [screaming] more, Lord, more? Help me,
[1:15:09] oh God.
[1:15:11] Why? Because there's been a supernatural
[1:15:13] power. You have not come to Sinai under
[1:15:16] a denomination. You have [screaming]
[1:15:17] come to Mount Zion.
[1:15:20] Hallelujah. You're part of the kingdom
[1:15:22] that's being developed in the world.
[1:15:25] You're being trained for rulership in
[1:15:27] the in the worlds to come.
[1:15:30] This is what the gospel is all about.
[1:15:33] See, so how
[1:15:36] will I operate the third pull? You just
[1:15:39] know this. God's word needs to manifest
[1:15:41] in this dark age.
[1:15:43] I'm here to tell you, he has designated
[1:15:46] it to speak through you. God doesn't
[1:15:50] need the whole world. He's looking for a
[1:15:53] few good men and women
[1:15:56] who are willing to surrender their life
[1:15:59] and meet his need.
[1:16:02] How many are there in this building
[1:16:04] today who say, "I would love to think
[1:16:06] that I could meet his need. I'm always
[1:16:09] asking him about my needs. He's always
[1:16:11] pouring so much on me. I'm so far
[1:16:13] behind. I'll never catch up. I can never
[1:16:15] repay. You're right. You can't. But yet,
[1:16:18] he has a need of you also. I want to say
[1:16:21] today, Lord, let my life meet your need.
[1:16:24] Let my life [screaming] be a living
[1:16:26] voice of this word. That's why you put
[1:16:27] it in a book. You didn't put it in a
[1:16:29] book to stay in a book. You when the
[1:16:31] when the book is closed for the last
[1:16:32] time, the [screaming] word will be
[1:16:34] flesh. You always intended to have it
[1:16:36] flesh.
[1:16:39] The word spoke about Jesus.
[1:16:42] It spoke of the coming Messiah. God was
[1:16:45] not satisfied with that. God put him in
[1:16:48] the earth and all the everything that
[1:16:50] was written became a human.
[1:16:54] Amen.
[1:16:54] And he's the beginning of a whole brand
[1:16:57] new creation.
[1:16:58] The church of the living God.
[1:17:01] This is what the gospel is about. This
[1:17:03] is what we believe. This is why we love
[1:17:06] the Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:17:08] It's more than just a theology. My
[1:17:10] goodness.
[1:17:12] Oh, I'd be so sad if that's all I had.
[1:17:15] If I didn't have a living reality of God
[1:17:17] in my life and I could feel him moving
[1:17:19] and I could see him moving and see him
[1:17:21] manifesting and see and feel and hear
[1:17:23] and touch and taste the power of the
[1:17:27] word of God in operation.
[1:17:29] Amen.
[1:17:31] He created this need in Abraham.
[1:17:35] Abraham needed to not lose his son.
[1:17:38] That's quite a need.
[1:17:41] Would you agree with me
[1:17:43] that that would be the greatest need he
[1:17:45] had ever had?
[1:17:48] You know, so so maybe it's not something
[1:17:51] God is planning to do in my life. You
[1:17:54] know, this this whole third pull, this
[1:17:56] whole spoken word, we've got these
[1:17:58] examples,
[1:18:00] you know, of fish and tumors. And I told
[1:18:02] you last time that that particular one
[1:18:04] there when he disappeared a tumor by a
[1:18:07] spoken word in an instant. I just said
[1:18:10] to me maybe other than the salvation of
[1:18:13] my sons the that that disappearing that
[1:18:16] that cancerous demon and a with a word
[1:18:19] disappeared it. And I just I remember
[1:18:22] saying to you here in part four, five or
[1:18:23] six somewhere back in there. I said I
[1:18:26] got things in my life that need
[1:18:28] disappeared. I got things that wasn't w
[1:18:30] wasn't supposed to be part of me that
[1:18:32] came as a result of sin or I was raised
[1:18:34] or this happened to me or that happened
[1:18:36] to me or this happened to you or that
[1:18:37] happened to you and it caused things in
[1:18:39] our life and maybe we were even
[1:18:41] culpable. Come on.
[1:18:42] Maybe we have to take some ownership in
[1:18:44] part of it. But I need a word that can
[1:18:46] disappear those things out of my life.
[1:18:52] Amen. And I don't know if it's something
[1:18:54] I don't think it's something that we
[1:18:56] plan to go around every day. You know, I
[1:18:59] do every day in my life, every waking
[1:19:01] hour as I walk these last miles of
[1:19:04] earth's history. But it's very
[1:19:06] comforting to know that it will be there
[1:19:10] when I face my greatest need.
[1:19:14] That's what it was for Abraham.
[1:19:17] It met his greatest need. Oh friends,
[1:19:20] you're almost certainly say, "What's my
[1:19:23] greatest need, Brother Jason?" Well,
[1:19:24] you're almost certainly never going to
[1:19:26] be able to figure that one out. You're
[1:19:28] almost certainly never going to be able
[1:19:30] to decipher your greatest need. But can
[1:19:33] I say to you today, "Shalom, bride,
[1:19:35] because it'll be the mind of Christ
[1:19:37] operating." You don't have to worry.
[1:19:38] [screaming]
[1:19:39] You got enough to worry about. Don't
[1:19:40] worry about that. It'll be the mind of
[1:19:42] Christ. worry about your sincerity and
[1:19:44] about your [screaming] dedication to the
[1:19:46] Lord.
[1:19:48] Because it will meet my greatest need.
[1:19:51] God knows what it is.
[1:19:53] Amen.
[1:19:55] So I just say today, I'm happy to just
[1:19:58] let him do the driving.
[1:19:59] Amen.
[1:20:01] You see, perfect faith in the third pull
[1:20:04] is distinct from human faith. And human
[1:20:07] faith's important. Even the right mental
[1:20:10] attitude towards every promise of God,
[1:20:15] any promise of God will bring it to
[1:20:17] pass.
[1:20:18] Amen.
[1:20:20] See, so we're not discounting human
[1:20:24] faith. You need human faith. You know,
[1:20:26] here's a prophet sitting trying to
[1:20:28] explain that to a young girl.
[1:20:30] And you know, he's he's looking at a at
[1:20:32] a fan and he's looking at a window shade
[1:20:35] and he says, "Watch." and he just stared
[1:20:37] at it and the shade rolled up and the
[1:20:39] shade rolled down and she said, "Brother
[1:20:41] Brandon,
[1:20:43] that's spiritualism." He started
[1:20:44] laughing. He said, "It's not
[1:20:45] spiritualism." He said, "It's just
[1:20:47] faith. There was a prophet who had
[1:20:49] learned how to operate that." And he
[1:20:51] looked, he just stares at it. He said,
[1:20:52] "Bring me a crosseyed child." He said
[1:20:54] this in front of the whole world with
[1:20:56] thousands of people.
[1:20:57] Yeah.
[1:20:58] You better be able to put up or shut up.
[1:21:00] And he said, "Just bring me any
[1:21:01] crosseyed child. I'll straighten her
[1:21:03] eyes out just by looking at them."
[1:21:04] Yeah. and he had done it.
[1:21:07] See, now he's he knew that that that's
[1:21:09] not the answer because that won't last.
[1:21:11] They asked him, "Do you have to be a
[1:21:12] Christian to get healed?" He said, "No,
[1:21:14] you don't have to be a Christian to get
[1:21:15] healed. The atonement is for whomsoever
[1:21:17] will." You don't have to be a Christian
[1:21:18] to get healed. But he said, "You you
[1:21:20] need to be a Christian if you want to
[1:21:21] stay healed."
[1:21:23] You come up under this anointing, the
[1:21:24] devil will take off. But as soon as you
[1:21:26] get outside and you're not a Christian
[1:21:27] and you haven't given your heart to the
[1:21:28] Lord, he'll just come right back and
[1:21:30] bring some buddies. Yeah. Amen.
[1:21:33] See where the the real church ain't
[1:21:36] playing church.
[1:21:38] This is life and death for many people.
[1:21:40] See,
[1:21:42] so [snorts]
[1:21:43] so we take it very seriously.
[1:21:46] But it's distinct from human faith.
[1:21:47] Perfect faith is a revelation of the
[1:21:49] word that is sovereignly given to you.
[1:21:52] It's it's a it's a moment where you face
[1:21:54] a situation and and and from a world
[1:21:58] other than the one you're walking around
[1:22:00] in, from a realm other than the one you
[1:22:02] live and breathe in, from some other
[1:22:04] supernatural realm, there comes an a
[1:22:07] revelation of God to strike your heart
[1:22:09] to believe that word. And the next thing
[1:22:11] you know, you can't even stop it. You're
[1:22:13] just saying it.
[1:22:15] I've had that happen. You're just saying
[1:22:17] it. It just happens in a moment. You're
[1:22:19] just at the right place. And here's a
[1:22:21] situation and here's a devil and I just
[1:22:23] like just like Shamgar. I'm a son of
[1:22:26] God. I'm a child of Abraham and they
[1:22:27] come in here every year and I don't have
[1:22:30] to put up with this. And he grabs an
[1:22:31] [screaming] ox goat and wipes them out
[1:22:33] an entire standing army.
[1:22:36] Let me tell you something, friends. This
[1:22:37] supernatural power is real. And I'm I'm
[1:22:39] I'm putting you on notice that this is
[1:22:42] the demonstration that God is determined
[1:22:44] to do at the end time. I know we've
[1:22:46] [screaming] seen God move already, but
[1:22:47] I'm here to tell you there's more to
[1:22:49] come. And if there wasn't, we had
[1:22:51] already [screaming] begun.
[1:22:53] Hallelujah. And I believe in a fresh
[1:22:55] surge. I believe in the dynamics of the
[1:22:57] Holy Ghost.
[1:22:58] Amen.
[1:22:59] Falling upon the word that we've
[1:23:00] received and believed.
[1:23:03] See, it's perfect faith. I mean, this is
[1:23:05] exactly why it can save your family.
[1:23:09] See, that's exactly why
[1:23:12] this this is so powerful. It can save
[1:23:15] your family when all hope is lost.
[1:23:18] When all human this isn't human faith.
[1:23:22] When all human hope is gone, there's
[1:23:24] still this
[1:23:26] there. God doesn't you think God is
[1:23:28] limited. Oh my. By this natural realm,
[1:23:31] you say, "Oh, well, you know, I know
[1:23:32] he's the God of good men. He's the God
[1:23:34] [screaming] of all men. He puts rings in
[1:23:37] the noses of emperors. Nobody's a match
[1:23:40] for him." Put your trust in Christ. Pull
[1:23:43] your token and say, "Devil, [screaming]
[1:23:46] I claim this child. God knew I would
[1:23:48] have them and God knew I'd [screaming]
[1:23:50] be a believer and he's going to have to
[1:23:53] make a way.
[1:23:55] Hallelujah. [screaming]
[1:23:57] That's the power of the third pole.
[1:23:59] And all it takes is dedicated lives.
[1:24:03] It's the mind of Christ in operation.
[1:24:06] It's not your mind.
[1:24:09] The lesson then is consecration and
[1:24:12] dedication. How dare I I remember saying
[1:24:14] this. I don't remember which s part I
[1:24:17] said it in, but I found in a note and I
[1:24:20] know it was part of this series. How
[1:24:22] dare any of us to how dare any of us
[1:24:25] allow our lives to be one foot in the
[1:24:30] word and one foot in the world.
[1:24:34] One foot in the word and one foot in
[1:24:37] Leodosa
[1:24:39] at this critical.
[1:24:41] First of all, let me just say, how dare
[1:24:44] you do that
[1:24:46] after all God has done for you and he
[1:24:48] needs you.
[1:24:50] He needs you.
[1:24:52] He needs He's looking to this bride to
[1:24:54] fulfill his word.
[1:24:56] And then as if that's not as if that's
[1:24:58] not enough, all that he's done for us
[1:25:00] and poured out his life, how can we not
[1:25:02] how could we live with one foot in
[1:25:04] Leodysia?
[1:25:07] Not only that, but think about
[1:25:08] everything you need. As that's why
[1:25:10] brother Brandon said in perfect faith,
[1:25:11] listen, he said you're going to need it.
[1:25:13] There's a day coming. You're going to
[1:25:15] need it. Guess what? [screaming] You're
[1:25:16] here.
[1:25:17] This is that day.
[1:25:19] You've reached an impossible age. It
[1:25:21] wasn't impossible in [screaming] his
[1:25:23] day. It hadn't gone into complete
[1:25:24] darkness. But looking forward, he didn't
[1:25:27] even think we'd make it out of the 20th
[1:25:29] century cuz it was just too impossible,
[1:25:31] [screaming] too dark. And yet, here we
[1:25:33] are. I say we must be believers.
[1:25:37] Hallelujah.
[1:25:39] [snorts]
[1:25:40] See, so only sincerity and much prayer
[1:25:43] and consecrated hearts will insulate
[1:25:45] God's family from wrong outcomes. Not
[1:25:48] saying you won't get trials and
[1:25:49] tribulations,
[1:25:52] but ultimately God will make it for your
[1:25:55] good because that's his promise.
[1:25:57] Amen.
[1:25:58] Bible doesn't say all things will be
[1:26:00] good.
[1:26:01] People say, 'Oh, well, you know, the
[1:26:04] Lord the Lord said all things are good
[1:26:06] to them that love him. That's not what
[1:26:07] it says. It says all things will work
[1:26:10] together for your good.
[1:26:13] They'll work together
[1:26:15] for your good.
[1:26:18] You see, when we think about Elijah, and
[1:26:20] we we
[1:26:22] uh we we read this last time, and you've
[1:26:26] got a PowerPoint, Bubba, but just hold
[1:26:28] up. Well, you can go ahead and put the
[1:26:29] title screen up, Noah. Um, and we'll
[1:26:32] [clears throat] just if I get to it,
[1:26:33] I'll get to it.
[1:26:36] We we found out, and I I mentioned this
[1:26:39] briefly because I didn't want to go into
[1:26:42] it deeply at the time, and uh and it's
[1:26:47] and especially in a series like this. I
[1:26:49] have a brother who's a great friend who
[1:26:50] literally creates a transcript of every
[1:26:52] sermon I preach and I don't publish them
[1:26:55] by any means. what he does with them is
[1:26:57] his business. But but and I do get
[1:26:59] emails from around the world. I'm not
[1:27:00] behind that for you looking at let me
[1:27:02] look in the camera. I'm that's not me
[1:27:04] doing that. That's that's other people.
[1:27:06] But it's fine. I don't he's a great
[1:27:08] friend. But uh it's particularly helpful
[1:27:11] in a series like this because I don't
[1:27:12] always remember, okay, did I cover that?
[1:27:14] What did I say? And then I jumped ahead
[1:27:15] and then I went back here. And so I can
[1:27:17] index the whole text and say, oh, did I
[1:27:20] ever say that? Oh, yeah. Right there it
[1:27:21] is. And you you got saved today about 20
[1:27:23] minutes of material. Well, you don't
[1:27:25] have to listen to because you've already
[1:27:26] heard it
[1:27:28] to brother coffee. I you're brother
[1:27:31] Mark. They're thanking you today. Amen.
[1:27:35] But but here so here's one thing I do
[1:27:37] remember talking about briefly and I
[1:27:38] went back to look at the transcript to
[1:27:40] see just how far I went into it. But I
[1:27:43] want to say this if some of it is a
[1:27:44] recap. I want it I want you to get it
[1:27:46] because to me it was a big point that
[1:27:49] for Elijah we've read about Elijah and
[1:27:52] Elisha and how that they crossed the
[1:27:54] Jordan went to the other side and Elijah
[1:27:57] was taken up in a as we would call it a
[1:27:59] rapture in a in a in a chariot of fire
[1:28:02] as a type of the rapture and then and
[1:28:04] then the mantle fell upon Elisha and you
[1:28:07] remember we've talked about how their
[1:28:08] names were so similar Elijah Elisha
[1:28:11] probably said like Mr. Jesus like Mrs.
[1:28:13] Jesus.
[1:28:14] See, it's Christ and his family. The
[1:28:17] kingdoms of this world have have become
[1:28:19] the kingdoms of our Lord and his Christ.
[1:28:21] That's the anointed. That's his family.
[1:28:24] See, you're not Jesus Christ. He's Jesus
[1:28:26] Christ. But but but she's Mrs. Jesus
[1:28:29] Christ. Just like it's all it is is Adam
[1:28:31] and Eve again restored back like in the
[1:28:33] Garden of Eden. That's the real mystery
[1:28:35] that unlocks the Godhead. If people
[1:28:37] would just not get tripped up on father
[1:28:39] son, they wouldn't see him as multiple
[1:28:41] people. It's a husband and a wife.
[1:28:42] That's that's the secret of the kingdom.
[1:28:45] See, so so so we realize that it is
[1:28:49] father son in those offices. I'm not
[1:28:51] saying it's not. I'm just saying you're
[1:28:53] better to think of the godhead as
[1:28:54] husband wife. You you won't get twisted
[1:28:56] around. So So we find that that Elijah
[1:29:01] they cross and then he says, "I need a
[1:29:03] double portion. What do you want for me?
[1:29:05] I need a double portion." And he was
[1:29:07] going to need it. he was going to. Now
[1:29:09] that has two that has a a dual meaning
[1:29:11] in the in the Old Testament and this is
[1:29:13] borne out in many common commentators
[1:29:16] but you also can bear it out in the
[1:29:17] original Hebrew. uh but we find that it
[1:29:20] has a a double double meaning that it it
[1:29:23] first of all it means in fact is from
[1:29:27] theologians if I just take if we didn't
[1:29:29] have a prophet we wouldn't even know the
[1:29:31] other half of it which is actually a
[1:29:32] greater half from theologians it just
[1:29:34] means that he's copied and pasted it's
[1:29:37] just a d he's just duplicated so
[1:29:40] whatever you are I want to be but a
[1:29:43] prophet in this day comes and goes back
[1:29:45] and peels off a few more layers
[1:29:47] theologians couldn't get to and he says,
[1:29:49] "No, it's actually a double like you
[1:29:51] think of a double portion because in
[1:29:54] this day we've got the double threat of
[1:29:57] the days of Noah and the days of Lot.
[1:29:59] You've got an age of Satan's Eden.
[1:30:01] That's unprecedented. You've got Satan
[1:30:03] as the god of this evil age. That's
[1:30:05] unprecedented.
[1:30:06] Hallelujah. You've got men's hearts
[1:30:08] failing for fear.
[1:30:10] You've got perilous times. You've got
[1:30:11] men running after seducing spirits.
[1:30:13] You've got teachers with itching ears.
[1:30:15] Those are all end prophecies. It wasn't
[1:30:18] that they didn't have some of that in in
[1:30:20] play all down through the ages, but
[1:30:22] you've got the whole tsunami. You've got
[1:30:24] the entire thing o overflowing you. And
[1:30:27] but I'm here to tell you when Satan
[1:30:29] comes in like a flood, [screaming]
[1:30:30] God raised us a standard.
[1:30:33] Hallelujah. And we we have a double
[1:30:37] portion.
[1:30:38] See,
[1:30:40] but of course you know that that when
[1:30:43] when brother Brandham has his experience
[1:30:46] there in the vision with the great Mamba
[1:30:49] and he said, "I I saw in this and what
[1:30:53] God was showing him, he saw himself
[1:30:54] walking on a map of Palestine."
[1:30:57] And he looked and he could see the
[1:30:59] Jordan River coming.
[1:31:02] And now the he's coming to the third
[1:31:04] pole.
[1:31:06] And this is the time of the the the
[1:31:09] third phase of his ministry, the last
[1:31:11] one. The one that's going to come on the
[1:31:14] bride, the one that's going to go on to
[1:31:16] Moses and Elijah. Same one, same Holy
[1:31:18] Ghost. See, people who say we don't need
[1:31:21] the Holy Ghost anymore. That's what
[1:31:23] Moses and Elijah getting.
[1:31:25] Good grief. How are you going to get a
[1:31:27] new birth? How how's the 144,000 going
[1:31:29] to get born again if they don't have the
[1:31:30] Holy Ghost?
[1:31:32] So, so people can just get so twisted.
[1:31:34] It's it's it's nonsense sometimes. They
[1:31:36] don't they don't know their Bibles is
[1:31:37] what they don't know.
[1:31:38] Yeah.
[1:31:39] And [snorts] so so we find that that
[1:31:42] when when it when it when it comes to
[1:31:44] that time and there's that great mamba
[1:31:47] snake and brother knew what it was
[1:31:48] having been on safari many times and it
[1:31:51] was very large and he said all the
[1:31:53] people men's hearts failing for fear.
[1:31:56] Everybody was afraid. It was a time of
[1:31:58] great fear. Everybody was afraid and
[1:32:01] there was somebody with him, a brother.
[1:32:04] And here come this great serpent. He
[1:32:06] said, "I could hear it crashing through
[1:32:08] crashing through the weeds and it came
[1:32:10] out onto the road and everybody's
[1:32:12] scattering." And he said, "And here it
[1:32:15] comes." And he said, "It comes right at
[1:32:17] me." And and and he said, "As as it
[1:32:19] began to get to me, it tried to reach
[1:32:21] tried to reach and it got stopped and it
[1:32:22] couldn't quite bite me." And he says,
[1:32:25] "You've been given power over him."
[1:32:27] Amen. to bind him and he bound him. I
[1:32:30] bind you in the name of Jesus. And you
[1:32:32] know the story. And he said, "You've
[1:32:34] been given power to loose him." And he
[1:32:36] said, "I loose you in the name of
[1:32:37] Jesus." And he started coming life. And
[1:32:39] he bound him back really quick. See? And
[1:32:42] so he he's got all of this all of this
[1:32:44] is happening because the Jordan is now
[1:32:46] in coming. It's the third phase. And he
[1:32:48] says, "Now this mamba, this sphere,
[1:32:52] these people that are following you,
[1:32:54] here's a brother following you.
[1:32:57] There's the Jordan. It's all working
[1:32:59] together. And what does it mean? What
[1:33:01] does Jordan mean? Death to self.
[1:33:05] Because what what what is he's saying
[1:33:06] now? You're going to have to be more
[1:33:10] sincere than you've ever been.
[1:33:13] He was asking for the impossible. And
[1:33:16] brother Brandham couldn't be more
[1:33:18] sincere and had no idea how to become
[1:33:21] more sincere. So you know what he said?
[1:33:24] Very well, Lord.
[1:33:25] Amen.
[1:33:29] Amen.
[1:33:31] I can't do it, but you said it
[1:33:35] very well. Then make me more sincere.
[1:33:41] That's quite a prayer because you don't
[1:33:43] know what you might be praying for.
[1:33:46] But I I just say today with all the
[1:33:48] courage and all the human courage I can
[1:33:50] get, anybody that wants to volunteer to
[1:33:52] come along, I want to say very well,
[1:33:54] Lord, then make me more. Make me more
[1:34:00] sincere than I've ever been in my life.
[1:34:03] Oh, I see all of you don't have that
[1:34:05] courage. You got that courage
[1:34:06] [screaming] today to say, "Lord,
[1:34:07] whatever it takes,
[1:34:09] by whatever means necessary." Yeah,
[1:34:11] there's some more honest hands, make me
[1:34:14] more sincere.
[1:34:16] Amen.
[1:34:18] Amen. See, because because remember
[1:34:21] because look the he's coming to this
[1:34:24] Jordan, death to self. We read about
[1:34:28] Elijah's rapture. Elijah would have
[1:34:31] never got to the rapture had he not
[1:34:33] crossed the Jordan.
[1:34:35] The rapture was on the other side of
[1:34:37] crossing. The rapture was a fresh death
[1:34:40] to self. Elijah was already a great man
[1:34:43] of God. But when it came time for the
[1:34:45] rapture, Elijah had to have a fresh
[1:34:47] crossing.
[1:34:49] Elisha received a promise, a double
[1:34:53] anointing. His mantle fell upon him. But
[1:34:55] when Elisha got back to the river, he
[1:34:58] also needed to cross Jordan. He had to
[1:35:01] have a fresh. He had followed the
[1:35:03] prophet. He had been loyal. He had been
[1:35:05] faithful. He went to church. He paid his
[1:35:07] ti. He sung songs. He He told everybody.
[1:35:09] He washed the hands of the prophet. But
[1:35:11] he needed a fresh a fresh anointing.
[1:35:14] Hallelujah. He had a secondhanded robe,
[1:35:17] but prophet said he needed a firsthand
[1:35:19] experience.
[1:35:21] If he was going to operate the third
[1:35:23] pole, if he was going to operate
[1:35:25] [screaming]
[1:35:26] the double portion, he would have to
[1:35:28] cross Jordan as well.
[1:35:31] Come on, friends. Where did John begin
[1:35:33] his ministry? At the Jordan. Where did
[1:35:36] Jesus begin his ministry at the Jordan?
[1:35:40] Where did a prophet come to the
[1:35:41] [screaming] Jordan?
[1:35:44] He said, "How vital is it? That mamba is
[1:35:47] here." And he said, "When it couldn't
[1:35:48] get to me, it went after my brother."
[1:35:50] That's you.
[1:35:51] And he said, "I was watching my brother
[1:35:53] and he was jumping up in the air,
[1:35:54] jumping and leaping, escaping, and the
[1:35:57] serpent trying to strike him. And
[1:35:58] brother Prideam is crying for mercy
[1:36:00] because here's why. Here's why. Here's
[1:36:01] why." He said, "I knew one hit and it's
[1:36:05] over.
[1:36:06] One hit and it's over. [screaming] Moms,
[1:36:09] dads, parents, preachers, one hit on
[1:36:13] your children and it could be over.
[1:36:15] [screaming] One hit on your You need the
[1:36:17] third pull. You need Jordan. You need a
[1:36:20] fresh anointing.
[1:36:23] That's how that's [screaming] how vital
[1:36:25] it is. That's how perilous
[1:36:28] the times that we live in are.
[1:36:31] You don't have time to have carnality in
[1:36:33] your home. Not if you love your family,
[1:36:36] fathers, dads. Come on. If you love that
[1:36:39] woman, if you love that child, have a
[1:36:41] token [laughter]
[1:36:42] applied to that home.
[1:36:45] Amen.
[1:36:47] Hallelujah.
[1:36:49] One hit is all it took.
[1:36:52] Elisha comes back down to the river and
[1:36:55] he can't open it because he he realizes,
[1:36:59] "Yeah, I' I've followed this ministry,
[1:37:03] but now it's got to become now that
[1:37:04] messenger's gone, and I can't just push
[1:37:08] play anymore."
[1:37:09] Amen.
[1:37:10] Amen.
[1:37:11] I'll go the rest of my life pushing
[1:37:13] play, but I can't just do that.
[1:37:15] Amen.
[1:37:16] I got to have Where's the God?
[1:37:21] Where's the God?
[1:37:23] I I followed a man who followed a god.
[1:37:27] Where's the god for me? What god? Baal?
[1:37:31] No.
[1:37:33] A star tank? No. Uh which which heathen
[1:37:36] god? None of them. Which god? The god
[1:37:39] [screaming] of Elijah.
[1:37:41] I want the god of Elijah. Where's the
[1:37:44] god of Elijah? [screaming]
[1:37:45] That's the god. I'm not here for the god
[1:37:47] of this evil age. I'm not here for
[1:37:48] leodysia. I want the God of Elijah.
[1:37:52] Hallelujah.
[1:37:53] And that opened the Jordan. And that
[1:37:55] crossed him through a fresh death to
[1:37:57] self.
[1:37:59] That activated [screaming] that
[1:38:00] activated
[1:38:02] his power over the snake. That activated
[1:38:04] his power over that serpent. That
[1:38:07] activated his double portion.
[1:38:11] Amen.
[1:38:12] Amen.
[1:38:14] Death to self is the only path
[1:38:16] to operating the double portion.
[1:38:19] That is what
[1:38:21] [sighs]
[1:38:22] that is what so many
[1:38:25] have lacked. They've tried to do an end
[1:38:26] round on that. See, but we find that you
[1:38:30] you can't do that. It you're if you're
[1:38:32] going to operate that ministry, it's
[1:38:34] [snorts] got to start at Jordan. You're
[1:38:35] no better than John the Baptist.
[1:38:38] You're no better than Jesus.
[1:38:42] It's where they had to start.
[1:38:45] See Jordan Jordan Jordan was in the path
[1:38:49] of of of the much needed sincerity.
[1:38:54] You get that? Jordan was in the path of
[1:38:56] that. The sincerity that he needed was
[1:39:00] on the other side of it. And for Elisha,
[1:39:03] the sincerity and the double portion he
[1:39:05] needed was back on the other side again.
[1:39:07] See, so no matter how you no matter how
[1:39:09] you go, you're not going to be able to
[1:39:11] get around it. a greater level of
[1:39:13] sincerity
[1:39:15] that is needed for this hour. And you
[1:39:18] know, brother Brandham, you know, he
[1:39:20] comes to the end of describing He comes
[1:39:22] to the end of describing Boy, I'm out of
[1:39:26] time. He comes to the end of describing
[1:39:30] his experience in the woods
[1:39:33] operating the supernatural part of his
[1:39:35] this this third pull, this supernatural
[1:39:38] part of his 33-year ministry.
[1:39:41] And that's where he begins to cry out
[1:39:45] for fresh revival.
[1:39:47] That's what it meant to him. That if I'm
[1:39:51] if I'm going to accomplish what's needed
[1:39:54] for this hour, I'm going to have to have
[1:39:58] a death to self.
[1:40:00] Remember, this is this is exactly what I
[1:40:03] believe the prophet is speaking of when
[1:40:06] he calls it a fresh surge.
[1:40:09] This is what the prophet is saying when
[1:40:11] we've operated in a small way, but you
[1:40:13] just watch when this begins to tighten
[1:40:15] up. Watch it then.
[1:40:17] See, and it'll be to the to the totally
[1:40:20] lost, to the church, and to the bride.
[1:40:22] And they all three have a different
[1:40:23] application.
[1:40:25] But this is the one where he said that I
[1:40:28] am looking for the the dynamics of this
[1:40:32] church will be a refilling of the Holy
[1:40:35] Ghost that we've operated in small way.
[1:40:37] I'm here to tell you something, friends.
[1:40:38] We're we're 60 years in. And you know
[1:40:42] that Paul's alpha age only had 20 years
[1:40:44] before they started to backslide. So
[1:40:46] they never made it to the body change.
[1:40:49] We've had 60 years to get back in step
[1:40:51] and get the word restored and get it all
[1:40:53] around the world and find it in the
[1:40:55] darkest jungles. And now we've got a
[1:40:57] global bride ready around the world.
[1:41:00] But the requirement remains the same.
[1:41:04] Don't leave here today thinking that
[1:41:06] this is, you know, to me, I I I don't
[1:41:11] believe that that it that it should be
[1:41:15] that I need the catalyst of the dead
[1:41:19] saints rising to somehow quicken my
[1:41:22] faith. I I I you know, God can do
[1:41:25] whatever he wants to do. And I guess the
[1:41:27] point I'm trying to make is that I don't
[1:41:29] want to think that I need some kind of
[1:41:31] cosmic jump start,
[1:41:33] right?
[1:41:34] I'd like to believe that I'm right
[1:41:36] there.
[1:41:37] I'd like to believe it's just a short
[1:41:39] little step
[1:41:40] and that when they appear in my living
[1:41:42] room, it won't it won't be that much of
[1:41:44] a surprise.
[1:41:47] Oh, hallelujah. because because it's
[1:41:49] very clear and I'm not going to go
[1:41:50] through the quotes today, but a prophet
[1:41:51] went quote after quote after quote after
[1:41:53] quote that there will be this bride who
[1:41:56] will call forth the sleeping saints.
[1:41:59] It'll be this bride and her life and her
[1:42:02] faith that'll literally raise the dead
[1:42:04] and call them back. Oh my. Oh. Oh, I
[1:42:07] don't know. I say, "How's that going to
[1:42:08] work?" I don't know. But it would thrill
[1:42:10] me if one of these mornings I step out
[1:42:12] into my living room and I feel a strange
[1:42:15] feeling and I don't know. It's going all
[1:42:17] over the [screaming] world. And
[1:42:18] something begins to well up within me.
[1:42:20] And I hear myself saying, "Brother
[1:42:22] Eddie, come forth."
[1:42:25] Hallelujah. Sister Seal, come forth.
[1:42:27] Brother Jesse, Sister Bonnie, come
[1:42:29] [screaming] forth.
[1:42:32] Hallelujah. You say, "Well, it happened
[1:42:33] that way. I don't know, but I know I'm
[1:42:34] going to be there. I know I'm going to
[1:42:36] be involved in it."
[1:42:37] Hallelujah.
[1:42:38] That's what happened to Jesus at the
[1:42:39] tomb of Lazarus.
[1:42:41] Lazarus,
[1:42:43] specifically you, [screaming] not
[1:42:45] everybody.
[1:42:47] [laughter]
[1:42:48] Come forth.
[1:42:50] Oh, my friends.
[1:42:53] This is the day the Lord has made. I
[1:42:56] will be glad and rejoice in it.
[1:42:59] Hallelujah. Oh, let's stand to our feet.
[1:43:02] Brother Anthony, bring your team.
[1:43:03] Hallelujah. I want to sing that song.
[1:43:04] Brother Andrew, this is the day the Lord
[1:43:07] has made. I will be glad and rejoice in
[1:43:11] it. Oh, I hope we have the words to
[1:43:14] that. Find them. Noah, somebody make
[1:43:16] sure you get those words.
[1:43:19] Amen. Amen.

[1:43:39] it. And be glad. Oh, this is the day
[1:43:45] that the Lord has made. I will rejoice
[1:43:51] and be glad in it. This [music] is the
[1:43:55] day.
[1:43:57] This is the day that the Lord
[1:44:01] has made again now. Oh, this is [music]
[1:44:06] the day. Oh, this is [singing] the day
[1:44:10] that the Lord
[1:44:12] take it over.
[1:44:15] Oh, [music] I will rejoice.
[1:44:18] I will rejoice and be glad
[1:44:23] [music] and be glad.
[1:44:25] Oh, this is the day that the Lord has
[1:44:30] made. I will rejoice [music]
[1:44:34] and be glad.
[1:44:37] This is the day. [music] This is the day
[1:44:42] that the Lord
[1:44:44] has made. [music] One more time. Oh,
[1:44:48] this is the day.
[1:44:51] This is the day that the Lord [music]
[1:44:55] that the Lord.
[1:44:58] Oh, I will rejoice. [music]
[1:45:01] Yes, we will rejoice and be glad. I'll
[1:45:06] be glad. [music]
[1:45:09] Oh, this is the day that the Lord has
[1:45:14] made. Hallelujah.
[1:45:18] [music]
[1:45:20] Oh, this is the day.
