[43:04] but um
[43:05] there was a request that came in to us
[43:07] asking all the saints of bethel
[43:09] tabernacle
[43:11] so apparently this is somebody that
[43:13] streams or
[43:14] catches archives and says asking all the
[43:17] saints at bethel tabernacle to join us
[43:19] in prayer for a very serious situation
[43:22] long time friends of our family tj

[44:08] as their savior then secondly that the
[44:10] lord would move on their behalf for
[44:11] healing through a transplant through the
[44:13] doctors at duke or by a miracle

[44:22] near hospitals logistics and expenses

[49:55] let's just catch from verse 32
[49:59] my
[50:03] matthew chapter 24 and verse 32. so many
[50:08] places i could start this morning but
[50:09] we'll just start here
[50:12] amen i want to by the help of the lord
[50:16] continue today with the greatest sign
[50:18] part 2
[50:20] verse 32 of matthew 24.
[50:23] now learn a parable of the fig tree
[50:26] when his branch is yet tender and
[50:28] putteth forth leaves
[50:30] you know that summer is nigh so likewise
[50:34] ye when ye
[50:35] shall see all these things know that it
[50:38] is near
[50:39] even at the doors verily i say unto you
[50:42] this generation
[50:44] shall not pass till all these things be
[50:47] fulfilled
[50:49] heaven and earth shall pass away
[50:52] but my words shall not pass away
[50:57] amen may the lord bless the reading of
[51:00] his word as you're seated
[51:10] so we're straight up noon now we've had
[51:12] just a little bit of extended
[51:14] worship and prayer and and uh
[51:17] announcements and what more
[51:19] and so uh if you give me your undivided
[51:21] attention i'll try to
[51:23] take about 55 or 60 minutes amen and we
[51:27] will uh
[51:28] we'll pull the chute and stand on the
[51:29] brakes see if we can get her stopped
[51:31] amen but this dragster is going to go
[51:33] down the runway today
[51:34] praise the lord amen amen so
[51:38] uh i want to be very studious and very
[51:45] i really want to follow close to my
[51:46] notes today because
[51:48] there's so much i have to there's so
[51:49] much on my heart i'll just blow up amen
[51:53] and go in all directions but i have a
[51:55] direc a definite burden on my heart and
[51:58] it's been difficult for me
[51:59] uh if you that might surprise you but
[52:01] it's been difficult for me
[52:03] to try to construct and separate out
[52:05] what we'll save for next time
[52:07] and what we want to cover today now
[52:12] you know it's as we were saying last
[52:15] night it's an amazing hour that we live
[52:19] in
[52:20] and i'm sure you all have seen it by now
[52:22] i started to put it up on the screen and
[52:24] really
[52:25] spend some time with it but it's already
[52:28] history now you know things are prophecy
[52:30] until their history
[52:32] and here we are today friends and we've
[52:35] had the prophecy
[52:37] for many years thanks sir we've had the
[52:39] prophecy for many years
[52:42] concerning and we weren't sure how it
[52:43] was all going to work out we you know
[52:46] we've speculated and talked about it and
[52:48] you know and and and it's not that what
[52:51] we concluded
[52:52] was wrong you know brother branham
[52:53] indicated a powerful woman or
[52:55] the catholic church and we see that both
[52:57] things are true
[52:59] that's why in fact as it was so
[53:00] remarkable to me brother branham
[53:02] you you have to include that because
[53:04] brother branham would talk about
[53:06] a catholic president elected in the
[53:09] 1960s
[53:10] and we find that that there hasn't then
[53:13] been
[53:14] a catholic president uh and and now we
[53:17] come to this time
[53:18] where we've got another catholic
[53:20] president and in fact is
[53:23] his entire cabinet is made up and this
[53:26] is not an accident first of all half of
[53:28] his cabinet is made up of women
[53:30] whose place is at home raising children
[53:34] amen and and so i don't care that that's
[53:38] uh not politically correct i couldn't
[53:40] possibly care less
[53:42] about being politically correct i i mean
[53:45] i couldn't i'm not even sure how to say
[53:47] that in proper english
[53:49] i couldn't care less than i don't
[53:52] already whatever i couldn't possibly
[53:55] care less
[53:56] and if uh and and if they want to take
[53:59] our website down and ban us whatever but
[54:01] we're going to preach the gospel
[54:03] the lord will get his word out amen i
[54:05] don't need i don't need the permission
[54:07] of these big tech
[54:08] to preach the gospel and so we realize
[54:12] that
[54:13] that half of them are women because it's
[54:15] a woman's nation
[54:16] and because it's a it's a woman's age a
[54:19] woman's nation
[54:20] and a woman and and and the age of the
[54:23] woman and
[54:24] so we realize that women have a
[54:27] high and lofty place in the family of
[54:30] god they have a very
[54:32] special place it was a woman who brought
[54:35] forth the son of god
[54:36] it was women who brought life back into
[54:39] the earth and
[54:40] it's a tremendous tremendous honor on
[54:43] the other side for all of those sisters
[54:46] who kept their place in life and honored
[54:49] god
[54:49] and in an age where they're where
[54:52] they're they're looked on with disdain
[54:54] for their hair and their modest apparel
[54:56] and their clean face and their
[54:58] their their meek and quiet spirit but
[55:01] i'm going to tell you something sisters
[55:02] uh when william branham went to the
[55:04] other side it was the women who got to
[55:06] greet him first
[55:08] it was million brother branham said
[55:10] women were coming
[55:11] the men were behind them so don't worry
[55:14] sister if you
[55:15] if you stand here in this age as the
[55:17] weaker vessel
[55:18] and keep your place in the word of god
[55:20] god is watching there's a record being
[55:23] kept of that
[55:24] and so i you know there it's it's a
[55:27] wonderful privilege but
[55:29] she certainly got out of her place and
[55:31] that's the backbone of the nation was
[55:33] motherhood
[55:34] once that was broken it was downhill
[55:36] from there
[55:37] now they can argue about that's right or
[55:40] wrong but what they can't argue with
[55:42] is what a prophet said it would produce
[55:44] in society and it has
[55:48] so i don't you know you you're pretty
[55:49] dumb to argue in the face of absolute
[55:52] results
[55:53] that were foretold ahead and now they're
[55:55] here and you still don't think somehow
[55:58] it's true
[55:59] well i i'm sorry i'm i'm glad for a
[56:02] revelation of this
[56:03] hour i'm glad for grace unmerited grace
[56:08] that gave me an opportunity to be a
[56:10] believer
[56:12] see grace p the world has the
[56:16] the deception that's in the world today
[56:20] is that grace you can just be anything
[56:23] that it's unmerited favor so it doesn't
[56:25] matter how you live
[56:27] but the bible says that grace teaches us
[56:30] to deny
[56:31] ungodliness so i'm going to tell you
[56:34] something friends it's not
[56:36] that you know grace to just live in a
[56:39] sinner's life
[56:40] and think that god's unmerited favor
[56:42] covers that it doesn't
[56:44] the unmerited favor let me read it to
[56:46] you like this
[56:47] it's un it's an unmerited opportunity
[56:51] that's right you understand it's grace
[56:54] it's an
[56:55] unmerited you couldn't do anything to
[56:57] deserve it it's god rich in mercy
[57:00] but now it becomes incumbent upon you
[57:03] and i
[57:03] to put on the whole armor of god
[57:06] to march forward in righteousness and
[57:09] holiness
[57:10] to give honor to the word of god in our
[57:12] lives
[57:14] to make christ the center amen
[57:18] they the world has that such a notion
[57:21] brother
[57:22] josh if you'll find revelation 19 for me
[57:25] we're going to catch
[57:26] verses 13 we're going to start at 13 but
[57:29] before you put it up let me make this
[57:30] comment you just find it for me
[57:32] brother josh revelation 19 and 13 have
[57:35] it ready
[57:36] you know this idea that
[57:39] that of what christianity is called
[57:43] today
[57:44] and it really modern christianity today
[57:48] it is not in any way uh
[57:52] real christianity right that's exactly
[57:55] right brother
[57:56] it it because i mean first of all it
[57:58] doesn't even have an appearance
[58:00] different from the world
[58:02] amen it basically is just a good
[58:05] neighbor policy
[58:06] and you know you know they they harp on
[58:09] the golden rule and brother branham said
[58:11] there's no there's no salvation in the
[58:12] golden rule
[58:14] so so we find that christianity is not
[58:17] and it never really has been you know uh
[58:20] a rule rulebook
[58:22] of ways that you can you can dress or
[58:24] act or talk
[58:25] and that qualifies you to be a christian
[58:27] what qualifies you to be a christian
[58:29] is the life of christ lives inside you
[58:33] and you don't actually need a book of
[58:35] rules
[58:37] your life just mirrors the person living
[58:40] inside you which is jesus
[58:44] so it's never been about that people who
[58:46] live under bondage and
[58:47] you know this message is somehow bondage
[58:50] to you
[58:50] you just need a new birth it would take
[58:53] away that bondage it would
[58:55] freedom friend as brother jason demars
[58:57] has taught us
[58:58] freedom is not you know people say i
[59:00] need out of this message i need to be
[59:02] free
[59:02] freedom is not living how you want
[59:04] freedom is actually being able to
[59:06] finally live
[59:08] according to the image of your maker
[59:11] you've been released from sin and now
[59:13] you can live
[59:14] like you were designed to live
[59:18] that's freedom if you don't have that
[59:20] you're
[59:21] in bondage you're the one in bondage
[59:25] not the believer the believer is free
[59:28] i can finally be the real me
[59:32] i don't have to be a prisoner and a
[59:34] slave
[59:35] to my evil wicked heart any longer
[59:38] [Music]
[59:40] what an upside down thinking the world
[59:43] has about real freedom
[59:46] and so you know we we find that
[59:49] here in revelation 19 13 all right
[59:53] he comes now riding out on a white horse
[59:55] and the bible says in verse 13
[59:57] he was clothed with a vesture
[1:00:01] dipped in blood now look and his name is
[1:00:04] called the word of god
[1:00:07] now that's interesting because that is
[1:00:10] exactly the message that the last
[1:00:12] messenger tried to tell him
[1:00:15] he's his word christ is not a creed
[1:00:19] christ is the word brother branham more
[1:00:22] than
[1:00:22] any other um principle that he tried to
[1:00:26] teach the world
[1:00:27] is he's his word jesus is his word
[1:00:30] and you can't separate him from his word
[1:00:33] and it doesn't matter if you have some
[1:00:35] idea of a historical jesus
[1:00:38] but you deny his word today if you don't
[1:00:40] believe him now
[1:00:42] you wouldn't have believed him then to
[1:00:44] believe him historically is
[1:00:46] pretty convenient
[1:00:50] it's pretty easy to do it's it's
[1:00:53] you know it's easy to to make every kind
[1:00:56] of brag
[1:00:57] and say oh if i'd have been back there
[1:00:58] well you've got an opportunity to prove
[1:01:00] what you would have done back there
[1:01:02] because that same jesus is the same
[1:01:05] yesterday today and forever
[1:01:07] and a prophet brother branham warned
[1:01:09] them for all those
[1:01:10] years of his ministry that he was the
[1:01:13] word
[1:01:14] that he was not a denomination he's not
[1:01:17] a man-made creed
[1:01:18] he's not any kind of organized religion
[1:01:22] and then the very next verse
[1:01:25] proves it verse 14 brother josh watch
[1:01:27] this very next verse
[1:01:29] and the armies which were in heaven
[1:01:32] followed him upon white horses clothed
[1:01:35] in fine linen
[1:01:36] white and clean everybody who believed
[1:01:39] the prophet's message
[1:01:41] proves it wait i'm gonna tell you
[1:01:43] something friends
[1:01:44] your life is proving what a prophet
[1:01:48] [Applause]
[1:01:50] taught
[1:01:52] it's it's literally as vindicated i i
[1:01:55] had a
[1:01:55] i had a one of these defectors recently
[1:01:59] try to you know try to threaten me
[1:02:03] try to say you know uh the rods are laid
[1:02:06] and god's gonna prove
[1:02:07] you know who's with him i just got one
[1:02:10] answer for him it's already been proven
[1:02:13] it's already been proven god's family's
[1:02:16] already here
[1:02:17] we're already dressed in the robes of
[1:02:19] righteousness i mean tell you something
[1:02:21] friends revelation 19
[1:02:22] is mount zion's showdown is who's going
[1:02:25] into rapture
[1:02:27] and you say well how do you know that
[1:02:28] you're going in the rapture because it's
[1:02:30] already started
[1:02:32] in me i'm already in process
[1:02:35] hallelujah amen
[1:02:39] it's already been accomplished see
[1:02:43] so brother branham says in in
[1:02:45] perseverance
[1:02:47] and i may have read this in part one if
[1:02:49] i did you're going to hear it again
[1:02:51] he says christ when he was on earth was
[1:02:53] the was the body of god god created this
[1:02:56] body it was a different body yet it was
[1:02:57] a human body
[1:02:58] see solomon built him a house but
[1:03:00] stephen said howbeit the most high
[1:03:02] dwelleth not in houses made with hands
[1:03:05] but a body has now prepared me so he
[1:03:07] says god
[1:03:09] prepared himself a body in the form of
[1:03:11] the lord jesus
[1:03:13] which was christ meaning the anointed
[1:03:15] one all right
[1:03:16] and now all that god was was in christ
[1:03:20] he was the fullness of the godhead
[1:03:22] bodily
[1:03:23] that's what scripture says now all that
[1:03:26] god was he poured out
[1:03:28] in christ he was emmanuel god with us
[1:03:31] and all that christ was he poured into
[1:03:34] the church what is it
[1:03:35] anointed one amen i i've read you the
[1:03:38] quotes i'm pretty sure already
[1:03:40] where brother branham identifies the
[1:03:42] body of christ
[1:03:44] in god's godhead you understand
[1:03:48] you're in god's godhead and now you say
[1:03:50] well why did he do it that way brother
[1:03:52] branham gives us the answer
[1:03:54] all that was christ was he poured into
[1:03:57] the church what is it
[1:03:58] anointed one to continue his work
[1:04:02] that his word might live constantly
[1:04:08] that if i if i don't ever get anything
[1:04:11] else
[1:04:12] from god or man for the rest of my life
[1:04:15] if i had to just brother branham said
[1:04:16] you know he talked about if i just had
[1:04:18] to
[1:04:18] lay on my stomach and eat soda crackers
[1:04:20] and drink branch water well i don't care
[1:04:22] whatever kind of misery you want
[1:04:24] as long as my life can bring forth him
[1:04:26] constantly
[1:04:28] i don't need riches i don't need fortune
[1:04:30] and glory i don't need accolades i don't
[1:04:32] need anything the world has to offer i
[1:04:34] don't even need for god to heal me or do
[1:04:36] anything else for me if he'll just let
[1:04:38] me
[1:04:39] live in a way that his word lives
[1:04:42] through me
[1:04:47] really i will tell you something friends
[1:04:52] i i find myself
[1:04:56] every day more and more and we are vexed
[1:05:00] by this world
[1:05:03] but i'm here to tell you something there
[1:05:04] is no vexation
[1:05:07] like when we look in the mirror of god's
[1:05:10] word as i was showing you last time
[1:05:12] and we don't see in the mirror of god's
[1:05:14] word we don't see his reflection
[1:05:16] perfectly
[1:05:18] that's vexation that's what drives me to
[1:05:21] prayer when i go over here and i look at
[1:05:23] a certain verse and i go
[1:05:24] oh man i don't exactly look like that
[1:05:27] wow
[1:05:28] i need to get to praying i need to i
[1:05:29] need to get a hold of god i need to
[1:05:31] have some more of the lord in my life i
[1:05:33] need some fresh anointing i need a
[1:05:35] revival
[1:05:36] there's nothing in your life worth
[1:05:38] anything up against that
[1:05:40] there's nothing i don't care what you
[1:05:42] would ever accomplish what you would
[1:05:43] ever become in life whatever station you
[1:05:46] would arrive at
[1:05:47] your life is zero unless you uh look
[1:05:50] like this
[1:05:51] unless christ has his way and his will
[1:05:55] and his wills his word
[1:05:56] if he doesn't have that in your life i
[1:05:58] don't care what you
[1:05:59] accomplish you're zero you have no
[1:06:03] value even to mankind unless you're
[1:06:06] living in the image of your maker
[1:06:10] hallelujah
[1:06:14] so he says it's to continue his
[1:06:18] work god the father which
[1:06:21] which is the father of jesus christ the
[1:06:24] great spirit dwelt in the fullness of
[1:06:26] his power and
[1:06:27] jesus christ which was the tabernacle of
[1:06:30] god made flesh and dwelt on earth
[1:06:31] representing the word
[1:06:33] jesus was the word and the bi watch this
[1:06:36] the bible said so saint john first
[1:06:38] chapter and the word
[1:06:40] watch and the word watch how brother
[1:06:42] branham
[1:06:43] gives uh meaning to john 1
[1:06:48] and the word was invisible
[1:06:51] now listen close the word was invisible
[1:06:55] until it was made flesh and then the
[1:06:58] word
[1:06:59] become visible and through his
[1:07:02] sacrificial death at calvary
[1:07:04] and his resurrection positionally placed
[1:07:08] his church
[1:07:09] in that realm that the same invisible
[1:07:12] god could end could come
[1:07:15] into the individual and make the word
[1:07:19] visible see i wish my church could get
[1:07:22] that i'd say that today i hope my church
[1:07:24] can get that
[1:07:26] if you could see friends the invisible
[1:07:29] god
[1:07:30] made visible what's my life about
[1:07:32] brother jason making god visible
[1:07:35] what decision should i make i'm facing a
[1:07:37] situation
[1:07:38] what should be my decision whatever will
[1:07:40] make him the most visible
[1:07:42] in your life see it's not rocket science
[1:07:48] see and i and and and that's god's plan
[1:07:52] now and i remember distinctly talking
[1:07:54] about this prior
[1:07:56] but that is god's plan you know that's
[1:07:58] that's what's up
[1:08:00] with god right now making himself
[1:08:04] visible in you
[1:08:07] and and i said to you last time you
[1:08:10] might be here today
[1:08:11] and you might be living in the biggest
[1:08:13] question mark of your life
[1:08:16] amen but but but but that's what's
[1:08:20] happening that
[1:08:21] that this is the why this is what's
[1:08:24] behind
[1:08:24] that trial this principle
[1:08:27] of god invisible making himself visible
[1:08:30] to a world
[1:08:32] that's what's going on in your
[1:08:34] persecution
[1:08:35] or in your trial or in your calamity
[1:08:38] i'm here to tell you something friends

[1:08:51] when that sixth vision was fulfilled i
[1:08:54] it rolls through my soul the end of
[1:08:56] suffering the end of suffering is at
[1:08:58] hand hallelujah
[1:09:00] oh when you know when we'll all come to
[1:09:03] the end of all
[1:09:04] suffering a time when man can
[1:09:08] be free at last and a time when we can
[1:09:12] let go
[1:09:12] of all grudges and all hurts and all
[1:09:15] unpaid debts where
[1:09:16] we're at it here you've arrived at that
[1:09:19] time
[1:09:20] friends
[1:09:23] you know why it's it's a it's a dark and
[1:09:26] wicked
[1:09:27] world and so many questions and there's
[1:09:30] so much going on and such unsettling
[1:09:32] times and
[1:09:34] you know i i get that it can cause
[1:09:36] anxiety and fear i
[1:09:38] totally get that you know it's it's
[1:09:41] interesting brother branham in a number
[1:09:42] of different places and
[1:09:44] i i thought i would just try to relate
[1:09:46] it to you but i'm going to have to read
[1:09:47] it a little bit because nobody can tell
[1:09:49] a story like brother branham
[1:09:51] he's such a master storyteller you know
[1:09:53] because
[1:09:54] you know he's got he's well he's got an
[1:09:56] advantage he's got prophetic eyes to see
[1:09:58] it
[1:09:58] and so you know he can read between the
[1:10:00] lines better than anybody
[1:10:02] and so you know he had it was brother
[1:10:04] branham who argued with dr davis over
[1:10:06] john baptizing jesus and brother brother
[1:10:09] davis said
[1:10:10] you know then jesus turned and baptized
[1:10:12] john brother i said no i can't
[1:10:13] that didn't happen brother brother roy
[1:10:15] no no no oh yeah billy it did you just
[1:10:17] don't
[1:10:18] you know you're wrong no it didn't and
[1:10:19] he said we used to go back and forth he
[1:10:21] said he might even be in the service
[1:10:22] here tonight he said i want to hurt his
[1:10:23] feelings he said
[1:10:24] he said but i know it didn't he said
[1:10:26] because he said i stood there
[1:10:28] he said i watched him he come right up
[1:10:30] out of the water went right up the bank
[1:10:32] he said i saw that that spirit come down
[1:10:34] on him said he went right up the bank
[1:10:35] and went right into the wilderness
[1:10:37] i'm here to tell you something friends
[1:10:38] we have an advantage of a prophet in
[1:10:40] this
[1:10:42] hour so he comes to the
[1:10:45] wonderful bible story that we've learned
[1:10:47] since our days as children
[1:10:49] of the three hebrew boys in the fiery
[1:10:52] furnace
[1:10:54] oh my what a thrilling story i remember
[1:10:56] as a kid
[1:10:57] hearing that story for the first time my
[1:10:59] eyes were bulging
[1:11:00] wow and brother branham now watch now
[1:11:03] let me
[1:11:04] let me give you let me give you a
[1:11:05] prophet's rendition of it
[1:11:07] gonna add a little bit of clarity
[1:11:08] because he's going to describe
[1:11:10] some things going on in heaven while
[1:11:12] that's going on in earth
[1:11:13] that the story in the bible doesn't
[1:11:15] cover see
[1:11:17] now the prophets do that all time isaiah
[1:11:19] did that ezekiel did that moses did that
[1:11:21] amen so
[1:11:22] don't think that that's odd for a
[1:11:24] prophet to look at something in the
[1:11:26] earth and start describing and go oh and
[1:11:27] by the way in heaven this is what's
[1:11:28] going on
[1:11:32] so brother branham says you know here
[1:11:34] they are now he sets the scene such
[1:11:36] such drama so he sets the scene you know
[1:11:39] aaron
[1:11:40] the king is just flaming mad wow you
[1:11:43] know and uh you know i'll give you one
[1:11:45] more chance boys we don't
[1:11:46] we don't need another chance you know
[1:11:48] i'm going to give you three minutes we
[1:11:50] don't need one
[1:11:51] i'll give you 10 seconds i don't need
[1:11:53] half a second i'm here to tell you king
[1:11:55] we're never going to bow to you period
[1:11:56] end of story case closed
[1:11:58] so we we well well i'm going to heat the
[1:12:01] furnace seven times hotter
[1:12:03] well we we might burn alive but we're
[1:12:05] still not going to
[1:12:06] bow down we know our god can deliver us
[1:12:10] and that's all that matters what come
[1:12:13] what may come what may come what may
[1:12:15] doesn't matter
[1:12:16] my whole heart is to serve him i don't
[1:12:19] care about the outcome i know what the
[1:12:20] outcome is the armies of heaven
[1:12:23] followed him on white horses and i'm
[1:12:25] going to be part of that army
[1:12:28] hallelujah
[1:12:32] but my can you imagine now there's
[1:12:35] there's quite a lot
[1:12:36] of anxiety and stress going on on the
[1:12:38] earth i mean this wasn't no joke this
[1:12:40] wasn't just a story this wasn't from
[1:12:42] homer this was
[1:12:43] this was real this was happening in real
[1:12:47] time okay
[1:12:48] it's not mythology and so
[1:12:51] here here's these young hebrew lads and
[1:12:54] they're
[1:12:54] taking a stand on the word of god and
[1:12:57] you'd think the king would have had
[1:12:58] enough sense he'd done seen god come on
[1:13:00] the scene so many times
[1:13:02] but i'll tell you something friends the
[1:13:03] world don't understand when they get
[1:13:05] under the power of the devil they do
[1:13:06] things that don't
[1:13:07] make sense and they do things and they
[1:13:10] think why did i do that i'm going to
[1:13:12] tell you something on the day of
[1:13:13] reckoning people are going to have
[1:13:14] the bible says there will be weeping and
[1:13:17] wailing
[1:13:18] and gnashing of teeth you gnash your
[1:13:20] teeth when the bitterness is
[1:13:22] too great to bear the bitterness of the
[1:13:25] opportunity of what could have been that
[1:13:27] you had a chance
[1:13:29] and that bitterness is so the finality
[1:13:32] of it
[1:13:32] is going to be so horrible they'll just
[1:13:35] gnash their teeth together
[1:13:38] but there's also something going on in
[1:13:40] heaven
[1:13:42] and brother branham he wants to turn the
[1:13:44] attention of the audience in the hours
[1:13:46] come 1951 he says
[1:13:47] look up this way see now we've been
[1:13:50] looking at the scene on the ground this
[1:13:52] is happening in real time but let's turn
[1:13:54] our vision and let's look up
[1:13:55] you need to do that a lot of times when
[1:13:58] you're finding yourself in a situation
[1:14:00] in life just start looking in this
[1:14:01] direction say lord i know you've got
[1:14:04] control of my life i know
[1:14:05] i know you're the boss of me hallelujah
[1:14:08] hallelujah
[1:14:10] he says look up this way you know i can
[1:14:12] see him
[1:14:14] oh here's isaiah isaiah did this he said
[1:14:16] i saw the lord
[1:14:18] high and lifted up i s that's the first
[1:14:21] sermon i ever preached brother richie
[1:14:22] out of isaiah 6
[1:14:23] 1. i mean i was breathless i thought
[1:14:25] this description isaiah
[1:14:26] i saw the lord high and lifted up and
[1:14:28] his train filled the temple
[1:14:31] and when he even when he spoke the
[1:14:33] pillars of the temple were moved at his
[1:14:35] voice
[1:14:36] i tell you something when god starts
[1:14:37] speaking things start moving
[1:14:39] hallelujah oh my you're the don't forget
[1:14:43] you are those lively stones that make up
[1:14:45] that temple
[1:14:46] where god lives and when god starts
[1:14:48] speaking i get moving
[1:14:50] something about it moves me
[1:14:55] oh my and he says i can see him sitting
[1:14:59] up there in his majesty
[1:15:01] his priestly robes draped around him
[1:15:04] looking down
[1:15:06] on this scene in babylon and he says i
[1:15:10] i see i love a prophet site
[1:15:13] i see coming to his right a great angel
[1:15:15] his name's gabriel
[1:15:17] great archangel he comes running up
[1:15:20] pulls his sword master have you looked
[1:15:23] down in
[1:15:24] babylon lord
[1:15:27] you understand what's going on in
[1:15:28] laodicea right now
[1:15:30] do you understand what your bride is
[1:15:32] going through at this minute
[1:15:35] master have you looked down in babylon
[1:15:37] your people's taken a stand for you down
[1:15:39] there
[1:15:40] the hour has come for them to stand
[1:15:44] and they're taking a stand i'm so glad
[1:15:47] to know the hour has come to stand
[1:15:50] and i'm standing others are running i'm
[1:15:54] standing
[1:15:56] hallelujah i sold my whole life to it
[1:16:01] hallelujah so he says
[1:16:05] but that bunch of people there is going
[1:16:07] to push them into that fiery furnace see
[1:16:09] the angel don't know the future see
[1:16:12] gabriel don't know what's about to
[1:16:14] happen
[1:16:15] understand right so he's looking at the
[1:16:18] scene gabriel don't know
[1:16:20] see and that's why saying master have
[1:16:23] you looked down in babylon
[1:16:24] so he says there's a bunch of people
[1:16:26] down there is going to push them into
[1:16:27] that fiery furnace
[1:16:29] let me go down there i'll clean that
[1:16:31] thing up
[1:16:34] would not have been a surprise on the

[1:28:09] men's hearts verse 26 men's hearts
[1:28:12] failing them for fear do we see it
[1:28:15] and for looking after those things which
[1:28:17] are coming on the earth
[1:28:19] for the powers of heaven shall be shaken
[1:28:23] then shall they see the son of man
[1:28:25] coming in a cloud with power and great
[1:28:27] glory and when these things begin to
[1:28:29] come to pass then look up
[1:28:31] lift up your heads for your redemption
[1:28:33] draweth nigh
[1:28:36] i've always appreciated that god didn't
[1:28:38] allow
[1:28:39] noah to put windows in the side of the
[1:28:40] ark so he could look out at all the
[1:28:42] chaos
[1:28:43] he put one window in the top so he had
[1:28:45] to look to the sky
[1:28:46] he could only look up amen and so
[1:28:49] we find that he says here now watch so
[1:28:52] now he's gonna
[1:28:53] bring come to the parable of the fig
[1:28:55] tree we read in matthew
[1:28:56] on it's also in mark 13 but here it is
[1:28:59] in luke 21 29
[1:29:02] and he spake to them a parable behold
[1:29:04] the fig tree
[1:29:06] and all the trees see because remember
[1:29:09] brother branham said it wasn't just
[1:29:10] israel putting forth the nation
[1:29:12] it was that and all the other things
[1:29:14] that were to happen all right
[1:29:16] so he says behold the fig tree and all
[1:29:18] the trees
[1:29:19] when they now shoot forth you see and
[1:29:22] know of your own selves that summer is
[1:29:24] now
[1:29:25] nigh at hand so likewise when you see
[1:29:28] these things come to pass
[1:29:29] know you that the kingdom of god is nigh
[1:29:31] at hand verily i say unto you
[1:29:33] truly i say unto you this generation
[1:29:37] shall not pass away till all be
[1:29:39] fulfilled
[1:29:40] amen we're here there can't even be
[1:29:44] another generation
[1:29:46] we've already seen the accomplishment of
[1:29:48] all of these prophecies
[1:29:50] we've seen the last vision of a prophet
[1:29:52] come to pass before the annihilation
[1:29:55] that's now history definitively
[1:29:59] that is definitively history
[1:30:03] look up your redemption draws nigh
[1:30:06] amen now watch
[1:30:10] heaven and earth verse 33 shall pass
[1:30:12] away but my words
[1:30:14] shall not pass away
[1:30:17] verse 34. it's going to get skinny you
[1:30:20] ready
[1:30:21] and take heed to yourselves
[1:30:25] take heed to yourselves
[1:30:29] don't just jump up and down with joy
[1:30:32] take heed perplexing times and distress
[1:30:36] of nations is coming
[1:30:38] men's hearts will fail for fear israel
[1:30:41] will put forth its leaf
[1:30:42] you'll see all these other trees coming
[1:30:44] forth when you see that
[1:30:46] take heed to yourselves
[1:30:49] lest at any time your heart be
[1:30:52] overcharged with surfeiting
[1:30:54] this is gluttony this is overeating see
[1:30:58] and drunkenness and cares of this life
[1:31:02] and so that day come upon you unawares
[1:31:06] so this indulging in the world
[1:31:11] this overeating on laodicea's delicacies
[1:31:16] take heed to yourself lest you do that
[1:31:20] because what can happen to you is the
[1:31:23] all of these
[1:31:24] things that i've just said will suddenly
[1:31:26] come upon you
[1:31:28] you might even be a child of god and
[1:31:31] you'll find yourself in a tizzy
[1:31:33] spinning around in fear you'll find
[1:31:36] yourself running and trying to hide in a
[1:31:38] hole in the ground
[1:31:39] you'll find yourself you know cutting
[1:31:41] yourself off from everything
[1:31:43] because these things caught you unaware
[1:31:45] and you realize wow the world is ending
[1:31:47] i'm not even prepared
[1:31:49] [Music]
[1:31:53] for as a snare it shall come upon
[1:31:57] it shall come on all them that dwell on
[1:31:59] the face of the earth
[1:32:02] watch ye therefore and pray
[1:32:05] three days a week oh i'm sorry
[1:32:09] my mistake watch ye therefore and
[1:32:13] pray always that you may be counted
[1:32:17] worthy to escape
[1:32:18] these things that shall come to pass
[1:32:22] and to stand before the son of god how
[1:32:23] many want to escape
[1:32:25] these things and stand before the son of
[1:32:28] man
[1:32:30] hallelujah that's where i want to be
[1:32:33] i already know these things are coming i
[1:32:36] already know they're here i know why
[1:32:38] they're here i know what's going on
[1:32:40] i know why i'm in a trial i know why i'm
[1:32:42] a believer i know all about the grace to
[1:32:44] have an opportunity
[1:32:45] i know all about the coming of the son
[1:32:47] of man what am i
[1:32:49] doing with it
[1:32:54] the minister of the son of man have
[1:32:55] control on my life does it have control
[1:32:57] in my home
[1:32:59] are my children being raised under the
[1:33:01] administration of the son of man because
[1:33:03] that's word made flesh
[1:33:06] see so it's all about the invisible
[1:33:10] becoming visible do my children
[1:33:13] see jesus christ when dad walks in
[1:33:16] do they see the word made flesh when mom
[1:33:20] moves through the house let's get a
[1:33:23] little quieter now
[1:33:27] take heed to yourselves
[1:33:32] what what what is what is our
[1:33:37] like brother matt was saying in the
[1:33:38] sunday school this morning you know we
[1:33:40] we have a completely different world
[1:33:41] view
[1:33:43] and it's it's shocking if the world
[1:33:47] doesn't see a different view of the
[1:33:50] world
[1:33:50] from you that's different than their
[1:33:54] view
[1:33:55] that this is happening and this is how
[1:33:58] they react but this same thing happened
[1:34:00] but you react differently
[1:34:04] here's something that happens in
[1:34:06] politics and it gives the world a
[1:34:08] certain attitude
[1:34:09] the same thing happens in politics and
[1:34:10] you got a different attitude altogether
[1:34:14] courts make decisions presidents write
[1:34:16] executive orders
[1:34:18] uh legislatures pass this and pass that
[1:34:21] and
[1:34:21] and the world gets all up in a tizzy
[1:34:23] with people's rights
[1:34:25] [Music]
[1:34:27] people's rights and everybody wants
[1:34:28] their right and everybody wants a free
[1:34:30] load
[1:34:31] nobody wants to take on the
[1:34:33] responsibility to take heed
[1:34:35] to themselves and make sure that the
[1:34:38] cares of life
[1:34:40] aren't aren't that you haven't over
[1:34:42] indulged on the cares of life
[1:34:48] until it affects your attitude toward
[1:34:50] god it affects your attitude toward
[1:34:51] god's people
[1:34:52] it affects your attitude toward god's
[1:34:54] word
[1:34:57] brother branham says here what here here
[1:35:00] here's the
[1:35:02] uh here's a piece of the master plan
[1:35:06] this will put a big piece of the puzzle
[1:35:07] together for you
[1:35:09] remember this is christ is the mystery
[1:35:11] of god revealed he
[1:35:13] is that tree of life contrary to the
[1:35:15] serpent seed
[1:35:17] see he that he's that seed the woman's
[1:35:20] seed
[1:35:20] the tree of life in the garden and lest
[1:35:22] they put forth their hands and move this
[1:35:24] tree they'd eat to the tree and live
[1:35:25] forever see they'd eat
[1:35:26] that tree and live forever in a fallen
[1:35:27] condition so that can't happen god's got
[1:35:29] to protect the word
[1:35:31] you can't understand it theologically
[1:35:33] because then you would never have to get
[1:35:35] a new birth
[1:35:37] and that's upside down to his plan so he
[1:35:39] hides the word people don't like that
[1:35:41] but god has to do it because
[1:35:43] man is forever trying to seek him
[1:35:44] through knowledge so god just disguises
[1:35:47] it and covers it up and uses angels to
[1:35:48] guard it and
[1:35:50] and causes prophets to say things that
[1:35:52] make people scratch their head and walk
[1:35:53] away and go
[1:35:54] it must be false go ahead go ahead
[1:35:58] go ahead say well can you answer this
[1:36:00] can you answer that
[1:36:01] you know i hear here's what here's my
[1:36:03] answer that was never a question when he
[1:36:05] was alive
[1:36:07] that was never and now you want to come
[1:36:09] along more more than half a century
[1:36:11] more than half a century later when he's
[1:36:14] gone can't defend himself can't clarify
[1:36:16] why he said this or did that
[1:36:18] when all the witnesses who didn't have
[1:36:19] any problem with what he was saying back
[1:36:21] there
[1:36:22] and now you come here and you can't find
[1:36:25] an evidence of this and just
[1:36:26] somehow you think lack of evidence is
[1:36:28] somehow evidence which is stupid
[1:36:32] and and and you can't answer this you
[1:36:35] can't answer that here's one thing i can
[1:36:36] answer you say do you have the answer
[1:36:38] here's my answer
[1:36:39] i know it changed me i know it made me
[1:36:41] look like this
[1:36:42] i know it made me love him i know it
[1:36:44] doesn't i know i don't
[1:36:46] i'm not wanting to leave this so i can
[1:36:47] backslide and go
[1:36:49] live like the rest of the world
[1:36:52] hallelujah say the rods are laid and
[1:36:54] god's going to show god's already
[1:36:56] showing it he's not waiting anymore the
[1:36:59] time of the delay is over
[1:37:02] he's now manifesting his life to a
[1:37:04] people
[1:37:06] hallelujah
[1:37:10] answer the question it wasn't a question
[1:37:11] a half century ago
[1:37:16] i was listening just yesterday here's
[1:37:17] brother branham on perseverance preach
[1:37:19] that message like
[1:37:21] eight or nine what are we thinking
[1:37:22] brother rich eight or nine times that
[1:37:24] was an important theme to god
[1:37:25] perseverance
[1:37:27] because you're gonna need it you're
[1:37:29] gonna have to be persevering he started
[1:37:30] preaching that back
[1:37:31] way back before the seals through the
[1:37:33] seals and after the seals
[1:37:35] because it's going to be one of the most
[1:37:36] fundamental pieces of equipment you're
[1:37:38] going to need
[1:37:40] hallelujah come on david you got it you
[1:37:42] better have some stones in that little
[1:37:44] bag
[1:37:45] you better be ready to take on a giant
[1:37:52] and he's there in new york city new york
[1:37:55] city
[1:37:57] and he's they they want to question the
[1:37:58] finnish boy oh because his story here
[1:38:00] doesn't match what was written
[1:38:02] in in in the magazine the editor of the
[1:38:04] magazine sitting there
[1:38:05] they just had a full gospel businessman
[1:38:08] meeting
[1:38:09] give me a break he's sitting right there
[1:38:11] and william branham starts telling about
[1:38:12] the finnish boy brought to life
[1:38:14] you don't hear demons going uh billy uh
[1:38:18] that's not right no you got that wrong
[1:38:21] he starts telling about the
[1:38:22] the little girl who took her braces off
[1:38:25] right there in those finland meetings
[1:38:26] he starts telling he goes down the list
[1:38:28] and telling all these things here's all
[1:38:29] these living witnesses who know it's
[1:38:31] true nobody
[1:38:32] he's not telling it in timbuktu this is
[1:38:34] new york city
[1:38:37] this is a global platform
[1:38:40] [Applause]
[1:38:42] brother jason why don't you just take
[1:38:43] and give us again and just take one
[1:38:45] sermon take a podcast give a definitive
[1:38:47] answer here's my problem
[1:38:50] here's my problem i'm gonna try to do
[1:38:52] that but here's my problem and i
[1:38:54] say this sincerely
[1:38:58] and i mean this it sounds humorous to me
[1:39:00] i chuckle at it but i mean it
[1:39:04] their questions are so dumb
[1:39:07] that i have a hard time having
[1:39:10] patience to even answer it
[1:39:16] why don't you just swallow a camel and
[1:39:19] strain at a gnat
[1:39:22] my goodness
[1:39:31] so he says here watch
[1:39:35] he says so the tree of life contrary to
[1:39:39] serpent seed i've got to hurry
[1:39:41] you see he's that seed the woman's seed
[1:39:43] the tree of life in the garden lest they
[1:39:45] put forth their hands
[1:39:46] move this tree they'd eat and live
[1:39:47] forever and and he's the only tree that
[1:39:50] can be taken that you can live forever
[1:39:53] his word is life his word is life you
[1:39:56] want to live
[1:39:59] his word is life and that be the word
[1:40:02] then the word of god which eve turned
[1:40:04] down in the garden of eden
[1:40:06] then here is christ the word made
[1:40:08] manifest
[1:40:09] it's interesting because not only could
[1:40:10] he say that then he could call for that
[1:40:13] pillar of fire and then prove what he's
[1:40:15] saying
[1:40:17] amen and when he come on earth he was
[1:40:20] the tree of life do you believe that
[1:40:22] and rome what did they do he had to be
[1:40:25] chopped down he had to be
[1:40:26] that's right he had to be chopped down
[1:40:29] and he was put on a tree of disgrace
[1:40:31] cursed is he that hangeth on a tree
[1:40:32] become a curse for the human race
[1:40:34] and now okay i told you i'm going to
[1:40:36] give you a big piece of the puzzle of
[1:40:37] your life
[1:40:39] you want to understand your life and now
[1:40:43] through that through him becoming the
[1:40:46] word in a man and through that man
[1:40:48] suffering the death on the cross through
[1:40:50] that tree of life being cut
[1:40:52] down now through that
[1:40:56] he brings forth a brag tree
[1:40:59] which will be the tree of life restored
[1:41:02] back to him
[1:41:03] as husband and wife in the garden of
[1:41:06] eden oh glory to god by the same word
[1:41:09] and the same god made manifest in
[1:41:11] husband and wife
[1:41:13] the same bride tree back
[1:41:16] again

[1:43:21] thoughts of your peace

[1:43:26] evil evil like
[1:43:27] like job got thinking that all this evil
[1:43:29] has befallen me
[1:43:30] but his thoughts were not of evil

[1:44:11] gabriel i'll get him out before the full
[1:44:14] ride comes
[1:44:17] we were part of him before the
[1:44:19] foundation of the world we came from his
[1:44:21] spiritual genes
[1:44:23] so he he already has a thought of you
[1:44:28] and i said this last time i think it
[1:44:30] bears repeating again today
[1:44:35] we were in his thoughts but sometimes we
[1:44:39] need to stop and ask ourselves
[1:44:42] is how i'm living what he was thinking
[1:44:48] because i don't have thoughts of evil i
[1:44:51] don't have thoughts of you being a
[1:44:53] failure
[1:44:54] i i'm working on you to bring you out of
[1:44:56] that thing i'm not
[1:44:57] left you here just for you to keep
[1:44:59] lingering in that stuff i've already
[1:45:00] sent a power in the holy ghost and a
[1:45:02] word that can wash you
[1:45:04] and a power that can deliver you don't
[1:45:06] stay bound
[1:45:07] get free hallelujah be willing
[1:45:11] to be freed hallelujah
[1:45:16] i love that promise i'm going to close
[1:45:18] i'm going to stop today i've got more to
[1:45:19] say but
[1:45:20] we'll bring it to a stop i thought about
[1:45:23] this for
[1:45:24] a while ruth 3 18.
[1:45:27] in ruth 3 18.
[1:45:31] then she said sit still my daughter
[1:45:35] until thou know how the matter will fall
[1:45:38] for the man will not be in rest until he
[1:45:41] have finished the thing
[1:45:43] this day i'll tell you something friends
[1:45:47] no matter what is happening in the world
[1:45:49] today
[1:45:50] no matter how hopeless it may look
[1:45:53] i'm here to tell you he's not resting
[1:45:57] i want you to know that it looks like
[1:45:59] chaos it looks like fear it looks like
[1:46:02] darkness it looks like the the dark side
[1:46:04] is winning i'm here to tell you
[1:46:06] something
[1:46:06] he's not resting i don't care what your
[1:46:09] symptom is i don't care how you feel in
[1:46:10] your mind
[1:46:11] he's not resting he's working
[1:46:14] and he won't rest say when will he
[1:46:16] finally rest when i'm in a rapture
[1:46:19] when i've got a body change we'll rest
[1:46:22] in the millennium
[1:46:25] he said i'll no more eat this bread or
[1:46:28] drink this wine until i
[1:46:29] eat it and drink it anew with you in my
[1:46:31] father's kingdom
[1:46:32] he must already have a vision of you
[1:46:35] sitting there
[1:46:36] he already has a vision of me sitting
[1:46:38] there
[1:46:40] he won't rest
[1:46:44] this is the time i'll make this last
[1:46:46] comment this is probably where i'll go
[1:46:48] launch from when i pick up part three
[1:46:51] i want to say this and i
[1:46:54] touched on this previously but there's a
[1:46:57] lot more to say on it
[1:46:58] brother branham said that he was told on
[1:47:02] the other side
[1:47:04] i got your attention five minutes
[1:47:07] we're done he was told on the other side
[1:47:11] nothing will come in here but perfect
[1:47:14] love
[1:47:18] glory perfect love now that's a broader
[1:47:23] term
[1:47:24] than you might believe because
[1:47:27] while it is what you think about your
[1:47:30] brothers and sisters
[1:47:31] and how you act toward them it's also
[1:47:33] what you think about god's word
[1:47:35] it's also how you act towards god's word
[1:47:38] you see
[1:47:39] and so so when when we say perfect love
[1:47:42] the
[1:47:42] one of the things that the bible warns
[1:47:44] about in the last days
[1:47:46] is that men would love themselves
[1:47:50] more and lovers of of ungodliness
[1:47:53] lovers of sin lovers of pleasure
[1:47:57] more than they would love god
[1:48:01] see so you know what perfect love in its
[1:48:04] greatest sense is friends
[1:48:06] is you you love his word
[1:48:09] more than you love you
[1:48:14] and you stop gratifying
[1:48:17] your fallen flesh and you stop
[1:48:20] letting the devil take you down those
[1:48:23] dis disgraceful avenues of sin
[1:48:27] say yeah i can but i repent he forgives
[1:48:29] me you do and he does
[1:48:30] thank god we have an advocate with the
[1:48:32] father but perfect love is that bride
[1:48:34] who finally rises up and says
[1:48:36] though my flesh might be tempted to do
[1:48:38] that i love him more than i love my
[1:48:41] desire
[1:48:43] i want to have perfect love
[1:48:46] perfect love i want to say when the
[1:48:49] devil comes at me
[1:48:51] i want to i want to love the word i want
[1:48:53] to love god
[1:48:54] i want to say lord i yes i'm not my
[1:48:57] fallen
[1:48:58] stinking flesh it's tempted by that but
[1:49:00] i'm tired of loving me
[1:49:02] i'm tired of loving me i want to love
[1:49:05] you
[1:49:05] i want to love your word i want to have
[1:49:07] the right mental attitude toward every
[1:49:09] promise of god
[1:49:11] then you know what that does that
[1:49:12] produces the kind of love you need one
[1:49:14] toward another
[1:49:15] [Music]
[1:49:17] because this is the hour you're going to
[1:49:19] need it
[1:49:21] this is the hour where we're going to
[1:49:23] need perfect
[1:49:25] unbiased unfettered uncontaminated
[1:49:29] love one toward another
[1:49:35] man we gotta stop loving ourselves
[1:49:39] love one another above your own self
[1:49:42] love god above everything that's the
[1:49:45] greatest commandment to love of the lord
[1:49:47] your god
[1:49:48] with all your heart your mind and your
[1:49:49] soul but we spend a lot of time
[1:49:53] loving us we love that man in the mirror
[1:49:56] instead of that man on the cross
[1:49:59] we love our own desires we love our own
[1:50:02] needs we
[1:50:03] we pet our own pettiness
[1:50:07] when our brothers and sisters around us
[1:50:08] sometimes our children and our family
[1:50:10] are
[1:50:10] suffering because of it
[1:50:13] so stop loving you and start loving them
[1:50:16] more than you
[1:50:17] start loving god's people more than you
[1:50:20] start loving god's word
[1:50:22] more than you amen
[1:50:26] amen perfect love
[1:50:31] let's stand amen i said 60 minutes and i

[1:51:54] be
[1:51:54] holy i want to be righteous
[1:51:59] say do you make mistakes i do but that
[1:52:01] only increases my desire more for it
[1:52:05] there's nothing about a failure that
[1:52:07] causes me to think i should just give up
[1:52:10] give up are you kidding me i just need
[1:52:12] to run harder

[1:52:35] more
[1:52:36] sinful amen and it might come to a time
[1:52:40] where i have to go

[1:52:53] the mercy of god can reach the deepest
[1:52:56] darkest sinner at any time
[1:52:58] any time of the day or night but i'm
[1:53:00] here to tell you something friends you
[1:53:01] gotta have to watch jesus said watch
[1:53:03] be careful pray don't get caught up in
[1:53:06] surfeiting over the world
[1:53:07] because what what that'll do to you is
[1:53:09] that'll that'll kill your spirituality
[1:53:12] and the things in the world to creep up
[1:53:13] on you and next thing you know you'll be
[1:53:15] in the grips of something heavy
[1:53:17] i have a really hard time getting out of
[1:53:18] it and even when you do
[1:53:20] young people young people even when you
[1:53:22] do
[1:53:23] and you finally come to your senses and

[1:53:28] the deep wounds and scars
[1:53:31] you will bear i promise you you will
[1:53:34] never consider them
[1:53:35] worth it they weren't worth it every
[1:53:40] scar of failure i have was never worth
[1:53:44] it
[1:53:45] i wish i didn't have them and i i it
[1:53:48] just makes me
[1:53:49] that more much more determined to press
[1:53:51] the battle

[2:03:28] praise the lord
[2:03:30] we've been looking forward to reopening

[2:03:34] presents its own conundrum
[2:03:37] i mean you know brother jason wow you
[2:03:40] know we're gonna wear mask in there no
[2:03:41] we're not but
[2:03:42] fellowship poison isn't a mandate coming
[2:03:45] to church is a mandate
[2:03:46] so you know we we we're commanded to
[2:03:49] come and gather in church so we try to
[2:03:51] keep
[2:03:52] try to keep safety standards as best we
[2:03:55] can
[2:03:56] there's no perfect answer to it friends
[2:03:59] i
[2:04:00] promise you there's flaws in my
[2:04:02] methodology there's flaws in yours if i
[2:04:05] let you be in charge of it
[2:04:06] it's it's unsettling times what do all
[2:04:09] we can do is the best we can do
[2:04:11] so uh but hey that's voluntary if you
[2:04:14] don't if you don't feel safe then then
[2:04:16] that's okay
[2:04:16] god bless you we're gonna have some
[2:04:18] fellowship if you want to come you're
[2:04:19] welcome to come
[2:04:20] and fellowship with us so that's kind of
[2:04:22] the difference because i had that
[2:04:23] question in my mind jesus what's the
[2:04:25] diff i said well
[2:04:26] you know as soon as i asked the lord
[2:04:28] that he said well to gather in church
[2:04:30] you're commanded to do that so you're
[2:04:32] not commanded to come to a fellowship
[2:04:33] hall and just sit around and eat and
[2:04:34] talk
[2:04:35] but it's a good thing to do
[2:04:39] a lot of strength in it hey man
[2:04:42] so amen we're you know you know what we
[2:04:45] don't want
[2:04:46] you know this is what the world's
[2:04:47] turning into we don't want a police
[2:04:49] state here
[2:04:50] i want this church to be a police state
[2:04:52] we don't want to it's not about that you
[2:04:54] know
[2:04:55] this is all just about love and and
[2:04:56] respect one for another that's all it is
[2:04:59] it's really all it is we need to we're
[2:05:02] going to need perfect love ain't we
[2:05:03] hallelujah amen
[2:05:05] so god bless you what'd i say i want to
[2:05:07] sing to heaven
[2:05:08] [Music]
