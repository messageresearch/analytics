[0:00] instead of giving you time
[0:01] to linger that atmosphere but
[0:04] that atmosphere should be in our lives
[0:05] all the time anyway
[0:07] amen and we uh
[0:09] we have some ideas and plans that we
[0:11] want to put to you
[0:13] and um it's preliminary and then brother
[0:16] matt's going to kind of give you where
[0:17] we where our thinking is
[0:19] there is still i want to say this so you
[0:21] don't run ahead with worry there is a
[0:24] ton of due diligence we still have to do
[0:26] to see if everything we want to do is
[0:28] even possible to see if the cost can be
[0:30] manageable
[0:32] but your trustees
[0:34] who you've entrusted to watch after the
[0:36] church in financial matters they are in
[0:38] unison today they took a vote among
[0:40] themselves they were 100 behind this
[0:42] plan brother mark will express that when
[0:44] he comes up
[0:45] but uh we're going to need your prayers
[0:47] we're going to need your support
[0:49] amen because it's quite ambitious and i
[0:53] i i have become persuaded in my
[0:56] in in my way and uh kind of just
[1:00] i don't want to say it any more than
[1:01] that just in my way i kind of was to say
[1:04] well let's just do some cosmetic things
[1:06] but
[1:07] if you know i be i've become persuaded
[1:10] brother jason has become persuaded by
[1:12] all the team of brothers to say listen
[1:14] if we do that and we make it pretty it
[1:17] really doesn't still meet our needs not
[1:20] even now to say nothing of long term
[1:23] so we're now looking forward to
[1:24] something a little more aggressive
[1:26] brother matt i'll turn it over to you
[1:27] god bless you
[1:31] bless you i'm getting if you want to go
[1:33] to pull that up we had a um
[1:36] and not that one not that one nope the
[1:38] first one i showed you actually just
[1:39] stand by we're going to show those in
[1:41] order
[1:42] so we had a business meeting i know that
[1:44] you um
[1:45] sisters probably
[1:47] uh inquired from your husbands what that
[1:49] was about and i'm sure most of you have
[1:51] been made aware that we've uh we're
[1:54] going to move into the second phase of
[1:55] renovations for the property we started
[1:58] with the outside and uh i personally
[2:01] think the outside is beautiful
[2:03] and we have a just a quite a bit of a
[2:06] difference the night and day
[2:08] at the end of all the project we'll show
[2:09] you some of the before and after
[2:10] pictures
[2:11] that we have but it's quite an
[2:13] improvement to what we've what we had
[2:15] prior with just the block
[2:17] um now we have the beautiful
[2:19] outside and the new landscaping and some
[2:22] other renovations we did even to the
[2:23] fellowship hall some of that there's
[2:26] still as you can tell there's effects
[2:28] from that that are temporary such as the
[2:30] trim around these windows just waiting
[2:34] also the lighting we put in new lighting
[2:35] didn't fix the ceilings because we knew
[2:38] uh we were going to be going to the
[2:39] second phase which would be the interior
[2:42] renovation and so just to sort of show
[2:45] you how that has evolved we had a
[2:47] meeting and that meeting was
[2:49] just to talk about some improvements
[2:52] that we want to do to the interior that
[2:53] would help the interior match the
[2:56] exterior and the look
[2:58] that we're going for
[2:59] and so that meeting was largely covering
[3:02] the removal of this ceiling that you
[3:04] have above you
[3:05] above these beams and i'm a lot of this
[3:07] is repetitive all of it's repetitive for
[3:09] the brothers who are here um but above
[3:11] you is uh
[3:13] beautiful just raw
[3:15] milled wood and trusses that that hold
[3:18] the roof and the walls together
[3:20] and so we it's we wanted our idea was to
[3:23] open this up to vault the ceiling it's
[3:25] already voted but to remove this and you
[3:28] would see the vaulted ceiling and the
[3:30] expose the beautiful uh wood that they
[3:33] that they used when they built this
[3:35] church 1950s i think if that 55
[3:39] somewhere in there so
[3:41] when they built this property they uh
[3:42] they did a good job at just some of the
[3:44] the way that they they uh put up the
[3:47] trusses and the the the materials that
[3:49] they use are beautiful so we want to we
[3:52] also have had a need for a while with
[3:54] air conditioning when it gets uh hot
[3:56] this ac system is undersized and doesn't
[3:58] keep up with the
[4:00] the need that we have especially during
[4:02] the hottest months
[4:03] and so the idea was also to
[4:06] change that completely entirely since we
[4:09] would be vaulting the ceiling
[4:10] you would no longer have the space for
[4:13] you could run duck a ductile system but
[4:15] the plan was was is to use
[4:17] um large commercial mini splits that
[4:20] would cool and heat the entire building
[4:22] um and so
[4:24] most of the business meeting was about
[4:26] the cosmetic things that we could do
[4:28] plus the air conditioning spray foaming
[4:30] the um
[4:32] the uh the the roof so that we could
[4:33] have you know proper adequate um uh
[4:36] efficiency for our heating and cooling
[4:39] and so we we sort of started with that
[4:42] and when we talked amongst brothers uh
[4:44] we were ball parking just a general
[4:47] ballpark
[4:48] um the demolition of that
[4:50] new carpet also this carpet has seen
[4:53] better days uh it's done really well to
[4:56] hold up they carpet on the stage and the
[4:58] carpet that's in the on the main floor
[5:00] seating has done well to to hold up but
[5:02] we want to change some of the colors
[5:05] a lot of the woodwork that you see uh
[5:07] maybe uh we we would consider it dated
[5:10] and so we want to update some of that
[5:12] the paneling that's on the wall to take
[5:14] that out and drywall change the color so
[5:16] a lot of cosmetic changes we were ball
[5:19] parking that in the range of about 50
[5:21] 000 somewhere in there of which we are
[5:24] going to do a building fund and fund the
[5:27] church funded the outside and so we're
[5:29] going to do a building fund to fund all
[5:31] of the
[5:32] the uh future renovations we were
[5:35] looking at after phase two which would
[5:37] be the interior renault to be phase
[5:40] three which would be the fellowship poll
[5:42] and obviously
[5:43] if you've been in the fellowship hall
[5:44] lately it's packed
[5:46] even with just a third or two-thirds of
[5:48] the church there there's not much
[5:50] there's not much elbow room and so we've
[5:52] had a great need there and so the idea
[5:55] was to maybe expand that
[5:57] maybe to cover in the pavilion and
[6:00] to stick frame that and to actually
[6:01] extend the fellowship paul move the
[6:03] kitchen there was a lot of ideas but
[6:05] obviously we were just focused on phase
[6:07] two
[6:08] after some conversation uh with brothers
[6:11] and and actually a lot of this is things
[6:13] that even brother mark carter and other
[6:15] brothers but the mark actually drew up
[6:16] some things and did some for the
[6:18] trustees and did some uh 3d imaging of
[6:21] that what it would look like with just
[6:23] toying with different ideas of adding
[6:25] the vestibule we need bathrooms in the
[6:27] front you know changing the fellowship
[6:29] hall maybe adding the building so there
[6:30] was all kinds of ideas
[6:32] but what we've honed down on is what
[6:34] we're going to do i'm going to show you
[6:36] in this floor plan
[6:38] is to rather than just go for
[6:41] a small cosmetic facelift you could call
[6:44] it that
[6:45] why don't we solve problems because we
[6:47] have some issues that we've had here for
[6:49] a long time on this property such as
[6:52] bathrooms
[6:53] out
[6:54] here no bathrooms at the front you have
[6:56] to walk especially if it's raining it's
[6:58] real inconvenient
[7:00] sunday school rooms bathrooms the
[7:02] heating and cooling problem that we've
[7:04] had the stage is too small these guys
[7:06] are cramped uh up here stage is too
[7:08] small and even seating when we're when
[7:11] we have our entire church and we're
[7:12] packed in it's packed in nice and tight
[7:15] but we we look to grow and the lord's
[7:18] there's families the church is going to
[7:20] be growing here over the next couple
[7:21] months with families moving in so how do
[7:23] we how do we accommodate everything
[7:25] solve some problems with our fellowship
[7:27] hall solve problems with office space
[7:29] and how the space is laid out currently
[7:32] right now
[7:33] and so
[7:34] um god sends the right people at the
[7:36] right time
[7:37] exactly the right time god sent brother
[7:39] steve and sister emily curtis our way
[7:42] and brother steve has a profession in
[7:44] design designs houses and so uh he was
[7:48] gracious enough to give us some
[7:49] beautiful renders and concepts
[7:52] actual life-like life-size so true to
[7:55] what it would look like because the
[7:57] program that he used he used his lidar
[8:00] on his phone to get an exact image and
[8:02] he took measurements of what the
[8:04] building space is square footage and
[8:06] then he put that in concept so the
[8:08] conceptualizing thing that you're
[8:09] looking at what you're about to see
[8:12] uh is the design the colors the carpet
[8:15] even down to the chairs everything is is
[8:17] life-like what it will look like
[8:19] um when we're when we're done
[8:21] i want to just say also that this is a
[8:24] preliminary i'm i we just wanted to
[8:27] bring the church up to speed because
[8:29] there was a lot of chatter after the
[8:30] meeting what's happening so today is not
[8:32] the full presentation we don't have all
[8:35] the answers um we we have a lot of
[8:37] logistics to work out that we'll be
[8:39] doing
[8:40] we do however have a team of team leads
[8:43] brothers who have agreed to lead up the
[8:46] effort um we have
[8:49] different brothers and those brothers
[8:50] are here most of them are here today
[8:52] some are traveling out of town
[8:54] um and then brother steve also has
[8:56] worked up these images uh and also on
[8:59] top of that he's worked up
[9:01] the initial preliminary floor plan there
[9:04] are some things that can change and
[9:06] things that i'm sure will change you're
[9:08] going to notice that the fellowship paul
[9:09] want to show it to you doesn't have a
[9:11] kitchen and it doesn't have sunday
[9:12] school rooms so don't bombard the
[9:15] trustees or brother steve especially
[9:18] leave brother steve alone um tom bob if
[9:21] you want to come to brother stephen ask
[9:22] question come to me to save him from
[9:24] getting bombarded because he's come to
[9:26] me yeah come to the pastor he's simply
[9:28] drawn what we've proposed to him uh and
[9:31] designed what we've designed and so
[9:34] there's going to be a lot of questions
[9:35] and what if we did this what about this
[9:37] we're thinking about all of that and
[9:38] there's uh you know there's a lot of
[9:40] consensus based things i'm going to show
[9:42] you uh two different roof plans one is
[9:45] with exposed trusses one is with a
[9:48] um what would you call the second i'd
[9:50] say
[9:51] like a coffered ceiling yeah like faux
[9:53] beams coffered ceiling all white um so
[9:56] there's there's two different styles i'm
[9:58] gonna show you here and then a really
[10:00] neat video brother steve put together um
[10:03] and so just going to show that at the
[10:04] very end i want to just say again this
[10:07] is preliminary it is the direction that
[10:09] we've chosen to go we're going to be
[10:11] doing a building fund um for that there
[10:14] will be a lot of fundraising
[10:16] for that brother ken boos is going to be
[10:18] leading that effort and he's going to be
[10:20] up here before you on his own discretion
[10:22] maybe weekly or every week basis just
[10:24] doing giving you an update on where we
[10:26] are with the fund um he's put together a
[10:29] document with a lot of good even
[10:31] scriptures i wish i would have read this
[10:32] morning didn't didn't pull them up i was
[10:34] going to pull them up just things that
[10:36] the bible talks about in nehemiah when
[10:38] they put their hand when everyone joined
[10:40] in unison and put their hand and had the
[10:42] spirit of help and of labor and of work
[10:44] so we need your prayers we're going to
[10:46] need your financial support to do it um
[10:48] it's very beautiful i'm going to start
[10:50] with the dry part of this which is the
[10:52] floor plan um just to show you an
[10:54] overview so you know what you're looking
[10:55] at when you see the render so pull up
[10:57] the floor plan gideon um there you go
[11:00] and make that big and i don't have a way
[11:02] to control it just make it full screen
[11:04] make it full screen the green yep uh and
[11:06] then command plus we'll zoom it in if
[11:09] you could do that zoom in again again
[11:12] can we turn these lights out and of
[11:13] course all of them every single one of
[11:15] them stage lights and everything
[11:17] and then if you can use the up down left
[11:20] and right arrow keys getting you can go
[11:22] up go down down there now
[11:25] up one
[11:27] stop perfect what you're seeing is um
[11:30] zoom out one time actually getting i
[11:32] want to see all the outside walls here
[11:34] and we can send this uh so that you can
[11:37] have and look it up close
[11:39] um
[11:40] man i wish i had a way to control this i
[11:42] don't know i can't use a laser pointer
[11:44] so maybe on a step you have the wireless
[11:46] mic brother
[11:52] just an explanation here
[11:54] the outside walls that you see here this
[11:57] entire square just the rectangle square
[12:00] if you could yeah use the mouse and show
[12:02] just the square here going around that
[12:04] is the existing sanctuary that includes
[12:08] from that wall back wall all the way to
[12:10] the back wall beyond the stage to the
[12:12] offices that's the existing building
[12:15] we're not expanding that we're keeping
[12:18] the same outside walls that we have here
[12:19] that's not getting expanded
[12:21] what we are doing in and and if you just
[12:24] uh let me explain it this way and you
[12:26] understand the prints better
[12:27] this stage the stage wall
[12:30] is is gone so everything goes back all
[12:33] the offices in the back the pastor's
[12:35] study the bathrooms that we have back
[12:36] here everything is gone everything
[12:38] shifts this way
[12:40] which will allow room um to to
[12:44] put what you see here and zoom in here
[12:46] gideon on this uh this front area here
[12:48] just zoom in right right here
[12:50] um and go over go over this way go over
[12:54] this way zoom in again
[12:56] here zoom in again
[12:57] okay so what you're seeing here is the
[12:59] vestibule area come down this way
[13:02] nursery women's restrooms an area just a
[13:04] little a wall leading into that men's
[13:07] restrooms above you could zoom back out
[13:09] and so vestibule bathroom sound room cry
[13:12] room all up front and then the stage all
[13:15] the way to the back now you say what
[13:16] happens to the offices
[13:18] and you know and all of that well behind
[13:20] that is the um addition if you go that
[13:24] way gideon that way
[13:26] yep and zoom in on that some
[13:28] if you could you see that there's an
[13:30] addition um on the back in between the
[13:33] fellowship hall
[13:35] and the church now will be filled with a
[13:37] new addition plus an addition to the
[13:39] side that is down here come down this
[13:42] way so down here this is a new addition
[13:45] to would be over here
[13:47] for the pastor's study go this way
[13:49] towards the fellowship hall
[13:51] and then zoom out
[13:53] zoom out now the current fellowship poll
[13:56] stops about right
[13:59] here
[14:00] stops about right there
[14:02] and so if you imagine a line going over
[14:04] that's our current size you can see
[14:06] we're removing the roof structure that
[14:09] we have back here and we're framing that
[14:11] all in and expanding extending the
[14:14] fellowship hall and even past that put
[14:16] in another awning almost like the roof
[14:18] structure but an awning that would go
[14:20] out uh beyond that and then there's
[14:22] restrooms also if you zoom in if you
[14:24] come up here to the fellowship hall area
[14:27] up here getting the very top of your
[14:28] screen and zoom in right here
[14:30] zoom in on this go over
[14:33] go over zoom in again so the entrance to
[14:36] the fellowship hall is here with
[14:37] restrooms we still got to lay out
[14:39] bathrooms etc um you're not going to see
[14:41] this in the con conceptualizing images
[14:43] you're just going to see the sanctuary
[14:45] that's what the con concept images are
[14:47] of but the floor plan shows that in in
[14:50] gist if i could just keep it simple the
[14:52] sanctuary we're not adding to the front
[14:55] some people ask that's going to stay
[14:57] what we're going to do is add a we're
[14:58] going to redo how we have the layout
[15:01] back there with the booth we're going to
[15:03] add men's and women's restrooms we're
[15:05] going to add a nice vestibule area
[15:07] obviously still have a nursery and a
[15:09] sound booth there and then by doing this
[15:12] setup of this new sanctuary we add
[15:15] between 70 and 80 seats
[15:18] to this sanctuary
[15:21] so we're able to stay on this property
[15:23] longer so
[15:24] really the improvements that we're doing
[15:28] is maximizing the potential of this
[15:30] property without going overboard and
[15:32] over building it so if we were to grow
[15:35] to a 300 the seating will seat 192
[15:39] is what the new sanctuary will seat if
[15:41] we go beyond that and we're in the 300
[15:43] range the lord tarries and adds to the
[15:45] church well then we would the trustees
[15:48] and the church would just have to decide
[15:49] to sell the property buy something else
[15:51] but this is maximizing it to its fullest
[15:53] potential
[15:55] so you would have this stage
[15:57] all the way back we would the stage
[15:59] would increase in size obviously not in
[16:01] width but in depth would increase in
[16:03] size
[16:04] you would have doors that come you could
[16:06] imagine doors even though stage is going
[16:08] to be rearranged that would lead to the
[16:10] new addition the back offices which is
[16:12] this area
[16:13] right here go over getting in this way
[16:16] uh
[16:17] that is this area here with a new music
[16:20] room pastor study av room some bathrooms
[16:23] back there a hallway a way to get from
[16:25] the fellowship hall into here and then
[16:26] back and forth
[16:28] um
[16:29] and so uh that that is the general floor
[16:32] plan uh ideas with the additions that
[16:35] we're proposing now i want you to go to
[16:36] the second
[16:38] uh make sure i want to make sure i get
[16:39] the right one not the one with the white
[16:41] ceilings
[16:42] gideon you should have another document
[16:43] no no close that document entirely go to
[16:46] finder and then open up the second the
[16:48] next document um give him just a moment
[16:51] to do that
[16:55] and then bring that up and slide it over
[16:57] um
[16:58] uh yeah that's it yep yep yep yep i
[17:01] think so keep going keep going over um
[17:04] okay make that full screen
[17:07] so this is just some images of the
[17:09] overhead view if i was back there i
[17:11] could zoom in and show this but i'm not
[17:12] going to try to do that now if you just
[17:14] go through some of the pictures
[17:15] go to the next one this is just a sky
[17:17] view
[17:18] um the next one there
[17:20] that's looking from just a different
[17:22] angle and now this is the elevations
[17:24] this roof here that's coming on the
[17:26] sidewalk and to the front is optional
[17:29] this is just a concept like i said this
[17:31] is looking from if you're approaching
[17:32] from battery creek road going down mossy
[17:34] oaks road next next image that's the
[17:37] front of the church next image
[17:39] stop stop there that would be from if
[17:41] you're coming from reebok as you pull up
[17:44] next image
[17:45] this is um
[17:47] there you go from the school as you
[17:49] approach if you were to park over here
[17:50] this is the side you see the new edition
[17:52] for the pastor's study uh coming over
[17:55] and tied into the existing fellowship
[17:56] hall next
[17:58] next next you can see that there's a new
[18:01] awning from out from the fellowship hall
[18:03] it's not the existing one that's a new
[18:05] edition keep going
[18:07] there stop there
[18:09] now this is the image of the new
[18:11] sanctuary all the way down from the
[18:13] colors to the design this is the exposed
[18:17] trusses that we talked about
[18:19] um and so the what you see tying them in
[18:22] is cabling and hardware black hardware

[18:58] next image there that's looking from uh
[19:01] right in this area looking up you can
[19:03] see the new brick wall the entire new
[19:05] stage setup and layout will be different
[19:07] little different than it is now
[19:09] uh next if i'm missing anything brothers
[19:12] feel free to just to stop me if i'm
[19:14] missing any details you the church

[19:20] see the cross that we have there's going
[19:21] to be lit it's going to be a lighted
[19:23] cross and this is this as if the sun had
[19:25] went down you're looking from the
[19:27] vestibule
[19:28] area to the left would be women's
[19:29] restroom and nursery to the right would
[19:31] be
[19:32] the men's restroom okay you can close
[19:34] that one
[19:36] there is there is also another one
[19:38] getting very much like that uh should be
[19:40] in there another document you could open
[19:43] just another pdf this shows the
[19:45] different ceiling uh we want to show
[19:47] that this is a
[19:48] different style make that large
[19:52] and you can just go through those
[19:53] pictures
[19:55] showing that coffer type still sealing
[19:58] look a little bit slightly different
[20:09] and then glass i like that a lot better
[20:11] glass doors for the vestibule doors
[20:13] leading in and that's it correct
[20:16] now i just want to tell you the last
[20:17] thing is just a video make sure the
[20:19] computer is on muted jackson if you
[20:21] could and has a little bit of volume
[20:23] because it has some beautiful beautiful
[20:25] singing to it sort of gives you an idea
[20:27] of what it would feel like inside of it
[20:29] i like how brother steve made this this
[20:30] is a video showing it's going to switch
[20:33] back and forth between the two ceilings
[20:36] options the exposed truss and then the
[20:38] coffer go ahead and play that
[20:39] [Music]
[20:43] move the mouse
[20:48] your presence is my favorite gift
[20:54] [Music]
[21:05] your presence is
[21:21] i think brother steve
[21:23] hey man
[21:25] steve did such a wonderful job
[21:27] amen on those i i told him i said the
[21:30] emoticon that has the the head that's
[21:32] exploding would be the perfect perfect
[21:35] one to use for that
[21:37] so i did a wonderful job on that so
[21:39] that's the update we can give you um as
[21:42] i said there's going to be more
[21:43] information more details to come
[21:46] that'll follow this we're going to be
[21:49] getting pricing that's just the floor
[21:51] plan preliminary plans we're going to
[21:53] need to mep the mechanical electrical
[21:55] plumbing plan we're going to need the
[21:56] demo plan we're going to need the
[21:58] foundation plan so there's a lot to get
[22:01] i've got to go to the city talk to them
[22:02] about what we're doing what we want to
[22:04] do um we don't know somewhere you know i
[22:08] would i would throw out a rough number
[22:10] of if the 50 000 was the facelift this
[22:12] is probably closer to 150. we won't know
[22:15] that number so don't don't ask us we
[22:18] won't know that number till we actually
[22:19] get hard numbers and pricing on
[22:21] everything and then when we have that
[22:24] brother ken will be doing a presentation
[22:25] on the fundraising and how to how to
[22:27] fund this so why don't you give the lord
[22:30] just another hand clap amen
[22:35] amen i got brother mark carter's gonna
[22:37] come and just say a few words from the
[22:39] board of trustees
[22:49] i just wanted to just reiterate what
[22:51] brother jason said what our role as
[22:53] trustees is and and maybe
[22:56] tell you how we actually think about it
[22:58] when we're doing that you know our job
[23:00] is to represent you all
[23:02] and things physical material with the
[23:04] church the property keeping the upkeep
[23:06] and
[23:07] also any indebtedness keeping the church
[23:09] from many
[23:11] what we feel would be
[23:12] unnecessary indebtedness um of course
[23:15] ours is just four votes brother george
[23:17] brother charles brother john and myself
[23:19] we're just four boats just like you but
[23:22] we represent you like when we go to
[23:23] these meetings and um
[23:26] my
[23:27] mindset and i know the other brothers
[23:28] feel the same way we've discussed it
[23:30] when i go there there's people with a
[23:32] big overarching vision like brother matt
[23:34] he sees the big picture what we can do
[23:36] um there's people that are very
[23:38] technical you know you could you can't
[23:40] do that because this won't work but i go
[23:42] there with the perspective of how it
[23:44] affects you how you would think about it
[23:46] even though
[23:47] i think of those things too you know
[23:49] it's um
[23:50] i try to put myself
[23:52] what the questions people will have so
[23:54] we are we do take that very seriously
[23:57] and when we go to one of the meetings
[23:58] we're thinking like you would think and
[24:01] i've had people come to me and say
[24:02] things like well it's you know
[24:06] what we got now works i mean it's all
[24:08] cosmetic what we're talking about doing
[24:09] do we really need it and um
[24:12] the way we're thinking about it um i
[24:14] think we took a poll here everybody
[24:16] would say that there's three things that
[24:18] we need i think it would be 100 all the
[24:20] bathrooms everybody would say we need
[24:22] new bathrooms
[24:23] um as far as room in here i mean on
[24:26] sundays it gets crowded there's even
[24:28] families i see them they can't sit
[24:30] together they've got to sit in separate
[24:31] parts of the church
[24:33] and then the fellowship hall this is the
[24:35] things we thought about the fellowship
[24:36] hall when everybody stays you can't even
[24:39] turn around in there
[24:41] every sunday it's a race between the
[24:42] ladies and the brothers to see who gets
[24:44] that good spot
[24:46] and we usually win because we eat faster
[24:48] so
[24:50] but yeah we considered all of that and
[24:52] um
[24:53] so we're in unison the trustee board
[24:55] representing you that this is
[24:57] a necessary thing we think that it's a
[24:59] good thing to do
[25:00] we looked at all the other avenues
[25:02] buying another place building from
[25:04] scratch and this is by far
[25:06] the most affordable and efficient way to
[25:07] do it
[25:08] and as far as like the cosmetic things
[25:10] um
[25:12] yeah just doing them
[25:14] from scratch it's expensive but in the
[25:18] whole big project of doing those other
[25:20] things
[25:21] doing those things then it's a bargain
[25:23] you can usually do that for about a
[25:24] third of what it would cost if we just
[25:26] went in to try to do that so even though
[25:28] they are just for looks that's important
[25:30] and it would be very very affordable in
[25:33] the course of this whole big project to
[25:35] go ahead and do those things
[25:36] so i just wanted to give you our
[25:38] perspective on it and reassure you that
[25:40] we take it very seriously
[25:50] not wonderful
[25:52] amen so we you kind of have our ideas of
[25:55] where we're going to go forward and i
[25:57] just want to
[25:58] uh just to say you know and i made this
[26:01] um statement to the trustees this
[26:03] morning and to all of the
[26:05] brothers uh who brother matt has placed
[26:07] into team lead positions that i cannot
[26:12] as the pastor here i cannot become
[26:14] entrenched in a construction program i
[26:16] hope you'll understand that
[26:18] you don't need me to anyway we have very
[26:20] qualified men you know i
[26:23] i have a duty to give myself to prayer
[26:25] and the study of god's word continually
[26:27] for your needs spiritually along with
[26:29] the ministry team that god uh helps me
[26:32] with and a lot of them are going to be
[26:33] working brother matt
[26:35] uh will be taking the lead as he did on
[26:38] the outside uh i there's so many people
[26:41] that have helped on every aspect of it
[26:44] uh one second deb one second says uh and
[26:47] um
[26:48] it's really been a great group effort
[26:50] but i think that we owe an extra measure
[26:52] of gratitude to brother matt and sister
[26:54] rachel
[26:55] who really uh rachel
[26:57] was really my right-hand man if i can
[26:59] call a woman that on design and
[27:03] and she's got a tremendous amount of
[27:04] leadership and influence on the inside
[27:06] of you saw many of our ideas we're still
[27:09] going back and forth on a few ideas but
[27:12] i just appreciate brother matt and
[27:13] sister rachel tremendously
[27:18] amen and so you know
[27:21] uh i'm sure it's no secret to you
[27:23] brother matt has
[27:24] served as my right-hand man to be my
[27:26] direct assistance to help pastor this
[27:28] church he actually pastored tucson
[27:31] tabernacle for a year so he has plenty
[27:33] of ample experience in it and we'll be
[27:35] i'll be looking to him to really take
[27:37] the reins of this so if you have any
[27:39] questions don't call me amen
[27:42] bother call him amen and uh and then if
[27:45] he if you if he don't have an answer i
[27:48] promise you he'll have a trustee or a
[27:50] team leader who will have an answer
[27:51] and so it's going to be a tremendous
[27:53] group effort the only thing that we we
[27:56] know for sure at this point is we want
[27:58] to do it
[28:00] now how we're going to do it and how
[28:01] it's all going to stack out and what
[28:03] it's all going to look like
[28:04] that's going to go forward and we're
[28:06] going to keep you in the loop of it i
[28:07] promise you we'll keep you in the loop
[28:09] of it and so don't don't think sisters
[28:12] that it's just a bunch of men going to
[28:15] design the looks we're actually not
[28:16] we're building the superstructure and
[28:18] we're gonna let um sister rachel take
[28:21] the lead and she's got some ladies that
[28:22] have been helping her as well
[28:24] uh look and and don't bomb sister debbie
[28:26] amen so but there there are plenty of
[28:29] people who will be looking at this
[28:31] and sisters with multiple talents to
[28:33] help uh put all this together now as if
[28:36] all of that isn't enough i need
[28:38] everybody to go outside and be ready for
[28:40] a picture
[28:41] amen so we're going to dismiss sister
[28:44] emily and let her go out there so when
[28:46] you go out there you'll be confronted
[28:49] and
[28:49] i'm just kidding
[28:51] yeah she'll get it over the fast she's a
[28:53] she's a professional photographer and so
[28:55] she will get it over fast and then
[28:58] she'll be able to get that raw data to
[29:00] sister wanda
[29:01] and i had personally just wanted to keep
[29:04] the um
[29:05] the directory uh digital i'm all about
[29:08] saving the tree i'm not a liberal but
[29:10] just about saving the trees and and
[29:12] let's just make it digital but people
[29:13] had concerns with having their digital
[29:15] information on our website so we're
[29:17] going to go back to paper i'm going to
[29:19] acquiesce in that but remember to
[29:21] acquiesce means to agree to reluctantly
[29:24] so
[29:25] i'm going to uh give the go-ahead for a
[29:28] new paper um directory sister wand has
[29:31] done that for years so we appreciate
[29:32] that let's stand to our feet and and uh
[29:36] we're going to be dismissed amen let's
[29:38] bow our heads father

[29:46] lord we just love you we love being part
[29:49] of your family we love being family to
