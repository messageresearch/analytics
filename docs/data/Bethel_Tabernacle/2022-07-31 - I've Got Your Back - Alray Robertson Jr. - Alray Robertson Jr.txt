amen amen god bless you thank you very much musicians it's good to be here in the in the house of the lord and it's really such a privilege for me to be here this morning i'll i'll let you turn to joshua one so long while i just make a comment or to joshua chapter one but it's just just such a privilege to be here i count brother jason as a close friend although i have only met him physically yesterday but um he's just been such an encouragement for me and and and i really appreciate his wisdom i've you know he's one of those brothers that i could phone with you know just difficult circumstances and things and he's always got a real real gift of wisdom with those things and i just thank god for him just really appreciate him just tremendously appreciated the time of fellowship yesterday and i just trusted that uh this morning could be a blessing to you i don't come to share anything special although what we have is special right but not anything new um i just come to be a blessing and and just trust we can fellowship together you know most of you i haven't met in this life but we're connected yeah right we've got the same father we come from the same place we follow attributes amen of the lord jesus so he just thanked the lord joshua one and we're going to start from verse 1. now after the death of moses the servant of the lord it came to pass that the lord spake unto joshua the son of nun moses ministers saying moses my servant is dead now therefore arise go over this jordan thou and all this people unto the land which i do give to them even to the children of israel every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that have i given unto you as i said unto moses from the wilderness and this lebanon even unto the great river the river euphrates um all the land of the hittites and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your coast there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as i was with moses so i will be with thee i will not fail thee nor forsake thee be strong and have a good courage for unto this people shall thou divide for an inheritance the land which i swear unto their fathers to give them only be they are strong and very courageous that they must observe to do according to all the law which moses my servant commanded thee turn out from me to the right hand or to the left that thou mayest prosper with us whoever thou goest this book of the lord shall not depart out of thy mouth but thou shalt meditate thee in day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then they shall have good success have not i commanded thee be strong and have a good courage be not afraid neither be thou this mage for the lord thy god is with thee wither so ever there goes but i love i just love that first portions of joshua regard says to joshua over and over and over and over be strong be courageous i am with you be strong hallelujah one more scripture just uh two verses from isaiah 54. isaiah chapter 54. i trust that my accent is not too strange to you praise the lord [Laughter] you see i'm sitting kind of between between two opinions i i have a mix of south african and kiwi uh new zealand accent and and and when i walk around the new zealanders they easily say you're a south african and when i go to south africa they they hear the kiwi tinge in the in the language so it's kind of somewhere in no man's land but it's all good so isaiah 54 verse 4 again god says fear not for thou shalt not be ashamed neither be they are confounded for they shall not be put to shame for thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth and shall not remember the reproach of thy widowhood more for thy maker is thine husband the lord of hosts is his name and the redeemer the holy one of israel the god of the whole earth shall he be called amen we'll just read that fa you may take your seeds do we have that power point on the here we go so now this morning i would like to to minister and i'll call my title um god's got your back or i've got your back so this morning i would like to just start off with a bit of teaching and just give you a little bit of background and and and i will just you know i'll just say i know how it is when you you have a minister that you don't know you kind of sometimes sit back a little bit and and check you know is this guy going to you know bring anything strange or whatever and like i said i want you to relax um and and i'll also say up front if there's anything that confuses you that that you know that that you don't agree with you absolutely welcome to to chat to me afterwards but most importantly go to your pastor i mean brother bannon made it very clear that that that that pastor is there to to shepherd you through i mean so so i don't the last thing on my heart is to come and cause confusion or anything i just want to be a blessing but what i would like to do is i would like to look at the parallels between the time of moses and joshua and our day and just look at how absolutely beautiful those things just just pan out so i'll just give you know go through a little bit of background and and just to link it up you know we are in the message and and you know we go to church i personally grew up in the message mom and dad got married after both of them had accepted the message already so i'm i guess you can say a second generation message believer um but the the challenge is that for me myself i walked in the message for 38 years before i met the lord jesus at the age of 38 2012 so now you can all do the calculations spear the trouble i'm 48. but at the age of 38 i eventually met god personally and and my experience was i lived years under do's and don'ts and doctrine but i never met jesus christ until the point where i actually where i believe god opened to me probably the most important thing for me personally is that i was totally lost i was a deacon in church and to my shame i had been ministering in church and totally lost and god had to bring me to the reality of a new birth and touch my life and and that's the challenge you know many times we can we can treat the message just as another church just as you know more theology or more advanced theology or a group of nice people or what you know whatever i need ah is it okay if i take my jacket off my brother okay thank you very much thank you this is much hotter than at home it's winter time at home at the moment so praise the lord um but but the reality is each of us need to come to that point where we have an individual relationship with the lord you know i believe i believe under the under this voice part of the rapture that we are now in under this in this part we where god is revealing himself and getting preeminence in the bride this is not a theological exercise it's not an intellectual exercise it's not just getting to know more doctrine it's not just to know more than the pentecostal church down the street it is about the individual walk and god makes up a bride and the bride as a whole is a combination of a whole lot of individuals in which god gets preeminence and god doesn't get preeminence when you just know more god wants preeminence in our life so we want real we want reality it's so easy to you know know the cod know the teachings but we need to meet god in that personal relationship so now that's just kind of just to set the trend and for you to to get to know a little bit about me but i want to now take this parallel like i said and in this in this parallel and i know you know many times we look at types and shadows and you can apply it in very different ways and and you know just just go with me this there's a way that i want to look at it now but what i want to look at is moses the prophet of the hour god using him god giving him three pools and we'll look at those things and then that prophet of the hour goes off the scene and then you have the joshua ministry america right and brother randa preaches adoption and you know ephesians parallels joshua and so forth this mature church now comes up under the joshua ministry under moses goes off the scene and so forth so mercy moses had a difficult life moses had to give up his human ideas his human desires moses had to give up a life that he could have lived and submit himself to the will of god you know moses could have been the ruler of egypt he could have been the pharaoh humanistically we might think you know wouldn't if would it have been so much easier if moses became the pharaoh and he just told the children of israel go and so forth but the problem is they would never have gone through those experiences that god needed to give them to actually be loosened from egypt and for egypt to come out of them but moses gave all of that up to be to be with god's people and to be a servant a minister of god's people and even when he got married to zipporah you know he was there looking after the sheep in the backside of the desert and probably after years you know he settled down and he forgot all about israel and probably the last thing on his mind was that he was the deliverer and and if you ask moses you know brother moses are you happy with looking after the sheep in the backside of the desert he would have said amen brother do you want to go back to egypt absolutely not you know he was just happy with the same old same old every day yeah it's the same we could say the same for brother branham you know if he had a choice he would have happily lived with sister hope not go through all the trauma that he had to he he if if he had a choice he would not have picked to become a worldwide evangelist and take all the pressures and and the stresses and the you know all the things that he had to go through he would have preferred to just keep on living a simple christian life but god had chosen a servant to lead his people out in exodus and it's the same for every son and daughter of god brother branham says he says but if we find a great lesson in here that men who follow the spirit is foolish to the world because they have another kingdom led in another way led by the spirit god let that be me and all of you that we will follow the leading of the spirit regardless watching god's promise waiting for it to be fulfilled now you know we we're a different people we're not like the world out there but god is not saying to us you know make yourself strange you know try hard to be different than everyone else try to stand he's not saying that he's just saying live a simple christian life be loving express my word live the life let the light shine off of you right but because the life of god is so different to the life that's in this evil age amen we will stand out we will be strange we will be different but not by our own making you know we can so easily make ourselves strange and different and weird but that's not what he said what we want is reality what we're after is get a reality relationship with god amen so now go i i'm still on this type now so so god spoke lip to ear with moses and moses laid down the law moses laid down god's requirements the pillar of fire was visibly seen on him and of course remember now this is a parallel to our day now and god let moses see into heaven god let moses bring to the children of israel a testimony of the things that he saw and god let moses set up the church according to how he saw it on the other side right and then god took moses off the scene and god took him off the scene before they could enter the promised land and and and so forth and and i maybe i'll say this god used moses to write the cod books for his day all right okay you're worth me now god speaks through the prophet and he shows him all the do's and don'ts in the church order and the feasts and the you know all those things but he'd never lived to see the time of the fulfillment of that full placing himself and then the anointing that had been on moses went over onto joshua just like he did today so so let me let me just put it in other terms now and in terms that we we're all familiar with so when the vessel of the shout goes off the scene the holy spirit now starts working directly with the bride and as the bride and the groom becomes one in this era of the voice i mean that that bridegroom starts getting the preeminence in this bride now and and i will say again you remember brother brahm says joshua means jehovah's savior and it's a type of the holy spirit today the holy spirit in the church that's why the shout was expressed through the prophet but the voice is expressed in many members represented by joshua now and and and what is happening is this is the last last day book of acts being written remember brother branham shows us you know it wasn't the acts of the of the apostles it was the acts of the holy ghost in the apostles and today it is again the acts of the holy ghost in this last day bright and when that anointing that was on the prophet moved over and started expressing himself through the bride form now it fulfills that prophecy that said i'll ride this trail once more we're not looking for a return ministry of the prophet we are looking for a return ministry of the of the son of man and that is happening right so that's what we're looking at but what we're looking at is is a life of living reality in god's presence a life where this bride is becoming one i mean spiritual union is not just a doctrine spiritual union must be a reality life spiritual union must be a relationship where this bride becomes fully submitted to a heavenly head and that is what the spiritual union that's what the seventh seal that's what the threefold purpose that's what the rapturing rapturing process is all about i mean is that union in which he gets full control i just love how all these things come together probably one of my favorite quotes from the church age book is where brother ram says authority without character is satanic but authority with character is fit to rule and that's what god's doing under this voice process before he can put his his bride on the throne with him before she can really become the queen of heaven she needs to get that character and that's character is being built under this voice part of the rapture that's what god is doing and part of the character is full submission to him where he has full preeminence where she can come to that place like it says and pick up your opinion and write she will know what he wants done with his word she will have his potentials hallelujah but she will know what he wants done with his word she will have thus saith the lord or she will keep still right we want to sometimes get excited about we will have all the power and authority and so forth but before we can be trusted with that we need to be fully submitted so that you only speak when he speaks so she only acts when he acts so that he can have that living reality in our life hallelujah brother rams is here is this joshua no this commission was tremendous did you notice the or when joshua started to cross georgian jordan how joshua remember this commission let not this book of the law my word depart out of your mouth now remember now god is saying to me and you now under this joshua ministry let not the message that you've heard pass from you let not this book of the lord let not this message my word depart out of your mouth in other words joshua i don't care what the tribe says i don't uh what other clergy says stay with this word we've received the shout out we don't go preach another word we want to stay with the word what god said in his word and and i want to include with that what god said through his prophet you know i'm just going to pause here for a moment what what what is just more and more striking to me when i read the messages i i it's the same spirit that was on on the bible it's the same the the way in which god spoke through this prophet and the types and the shadows and the things it just absolutely so exactly the same spirit you just pick up the same spirit as in the word right and and for me you know i've heard people have this whole argument well i i esteem the bible higher than the message or the message higher than the bible yeah what's the point what's the point of that this is the word and we've received the word in spoken word form in our day hallelujah it's one unit but he didn't stop with the prophet that same word is now in us i mean no the voice of many waters is now going forth and brother ramsay is the voice of the ministers and i believe the voice of many waters is not limited to the ministry only it's it's in every part of the bride because that elijah anointing i mean that joshua that god riding this trail once more is now in the bride right and god is expressing in reality form through the bride i mean hallelujah and i believe each one of us are standing in exactly the same place each one of us is standing in the same place as isaiah did as mike as as maika did and all those prophets we because we are under the same anointing if we can get out of the way let our own humanistic staff and our own thinking just get out of the way and god can use us hallelujah joshua i don't care what the tribe says what other clergy say stay with this word for then thou shalt make thy ways prosperous no matter how many big things they do how many little things they do how many organizations they made stay with this word joshua oh my stay with the word this word this word shall not depart from your mouth if the word says do a certain thing do it well that's hard brother bran no that's pretty easy to understand right if the word says do a certain thing do it i don't care what the organization says do it in here that's the joshua that god's waiting for turn not one inch one iota stay right with the word this book of the law i want to say this message remember this is today now this message shall not depart out of thy mouth thy mouth what you're saying just don't read it and walk away say speak it and live it right and then it becomes a living word then it becomes a manifestation of the word when we live it hallelujah speak it live it teach it but they shall meditate in day and night that they almost observed to do according to all that is written therein see what a joshua of this day is going to be hallelujah what a living testimony of the word i mean a living expression of the word and not only this word of course this word but the word we heard in this day we're living testimonies of that word and and and for us to be living testimonies it's not done here it is the same life expressing itself automatically through our lives hallelujah see what a joshua of the church spiritual is going to be it's the same kind of a joshua they had in church natural church spiritual has got to be the same thing he'll meditate there in day and night to make the way prosperous hallelujah like i said the acts of the holy spirit in us now hallelujah you know it was even i loved how even when they crossed the jordan river how that ark was put up front and and and i want to say the ark wasn't put up front to to go through the river because they thought that golden box had the strength to stop the river wow right come on they didn't look for some you know some token or some some something like that they put the word first they expressed the thought that they put the word first under the joshua commission above everything i'll just go back to something that i dropped in earlier moses stored up food and of course i'm speaking in today's terms right moses stored up food in the most technologically advanced way he could do whether that was papyrus or or animal hides or whatever it was but he stored up food for the joshua people hallelujah to be able to take and eat and live and teach moses lay down the law he brought israel the the truth of temple worship he pinned down god's thoughts about how they should live and how they should dress and how they should act in church order and so forth he brought them the conduct order and doctrine and many things that god revealed to them under that moses ministry was mind-blowing to the people because it was so different to everything they had experienced they'd never heard anything about that before amen but i want you to know just now where moses gave the law joshua instruction joshua's instruction from god was you keep it you follow it you honor it god did not give joshua a new word god didn't give joshua a different word god's instruction was and is today to this joshua i mean under this joshua anointing keep the word follow the word do not go after a different word and so forth follow the word that god has given you amen i just want to quickly i refer to that just quickly clarify that three pulls under moses ministry moses received two signs in fact when the angel came to brother branham he said as moses received two signs you will receive two signs direct parallel so moses had a first bull with the rod moses had a second bull with his hand right and then the third ball was when he led them out of israel with them out of egypt with a mighty hand and he brought him out of israel to the mountain hallelujah and received the word from god and then led them towards the promised land and the thing i want you to notice is we don't read ever in the bible again that after they left egypt that the first and second pool was ever repeated because there was no sign to repeat it and it's not necessary to attract the people in the middle they were already on the journey the rainbow trout had come out there was still a bunch of crabs and and and tadpoles and turtles with them right but the rainbow trout were on their way hallelujah the signs had already vindicated the ministry but under the third pool the food was stored up the word was laid down the word was recorded and although that but i want to say this although the emphasis was no longer on the signs god was still a supernatural god god didn't suddenly lose his power after you know all those things that happened in egypt god was still with them yes they still had water from the rock they still had you know the manna falling every day a daily i want to say a daily injection of god's spiritual feeding amen god still did wonderful things when joshua lead led israel into egypt you know we we read how the the walls of jericho falls and god was still with him god supernaturally used this bunch of nobodies i mean to conquer those mighty cities but there was no it wasn't a sign anymore we didn't need the first and second bull sign anymore after that but god still showed i'm present i am with you i am your head i love you i care for you i give you the victories and so forth of course i don't need to say it but that's exactly where we are today but the emphasis has moved away from the first and second pull the emphasis is moved to faith in the word to take the word i mean hallelujah i just i just so love these things i just trust that you can stay with me now so so so joshua he met the captain of the host and the captain of the host gave his gave him instructions and that captain of the host is giving us instructions now leading us day by day by day to what victories in our own promised land amen victories to take on the ais to take on the jerichos to take on the world cities and so forth the captain of the host is with us and the captain of the host as he said to joshua i'll be with you this step by step by step by step every every step your feet will take that i give to you that that that captain of the host is saying that to this bride today every step you take i will be with you i'm running ahead of myself i'm aware of that so now that was that was the background but i want to emphasize one more thing moses was a man of many mistakes amen and i hope you're not offended if i say that but brother branham was a man of mistakes right but the wonderful thing is god told joshua i will be with you like i was with moses now look at what brother braham says here he says but we find here that god in spite of all the failure that moses had done he still had his hand on him and he called him to go do his service calling him to his commission and what a consolation that must have been to joshua when he heard god say as i was with moses so will i be with you i want you to notice what brother madam is saying keep the context now brother branham is saying moses was a man full of failures but even though he was full of failures god was with him and when god said to joshua as i was with moses joshua could get confidence of the fact that although i am full of failures although i mess up so often although i make so many mistakes god was with moses irrespective of his mistakes god will be with me irrespective of my mistakes hallelujah brother adam says again he says although i'm trying if i'm trying and i fail god won't leave me he says i don't have much confidence in anyone that's too afraid to do anything i'd rather be found a failure than too lazy to try this one time it was said that the ballad and ballad flower company hired a man and he was going to sign his name and the man had no eraser on the end of his pencil mr ballard said to him said why haven't you got an eraser he said i don't make mistakes he said then i can't use you how many times do we find ourselves too afraid to move forward in the spirit but god what if this what if i'm not strong enough what if i fail what if i make a mess what if i say the wrong thing hallelujah come on let's be soldiers yeah yeah this is because if you make a mistake it says it says if you don't make mistakes sorry you won't do nothing right goodness you know that's one way to stay really safe is just to never do anything i mean i mean you're not going to mess up but then you're not going to have victories he says god don't hold you responsible for your mistakes hang on that kind of quote absolutely ripped the feet from under me growing up in the message with all the do's and don'ts with all the legalistic ideas and attitudes god don't hold you responsible for your mistakes i thought this is what it was all about i mean we all have to i've heard people present the message what do you believe well we our sisters have long hair that's not the message wow that's not the message hallelujah and first john it says this is the message that we have heard from the beginning that god is light amen in another place this is the message love one another as god has loved you so far the message is the gospel it's so easy to get to the place where we all have long hair long dresses and long faces right where we can hallelujah the message is not a list of do's and don'ts are we doing away with the do's and don'ts now of course not i mean we're not doing away with it i mean we have the instruction keep the word keep the word keep the word but god is at the same time saying i'm not holding you responsible for your mistakes because i know i mean paul wrote god you know that i am but flesh by that i am by dust god knows that he made us he designed us he holds you responsible for your willful son he that sins willfully after he has received the knowledge of the truth he says but a man that's going to do something is going to blunder oh brother i'd rather not quote that quote come on this is not reverse psychology this is the prophet this is the word of god a man that's going to do something is going to blunder so you mean the minister that preaches he's sometimes going to make a mess yes the mom and dad the mum and dad that raises the kids is sometimes going to make mistakes yes right in every way we sometimes going to blunder he's going to fall he's going to make mistakes but if he's really divinely called and god in his heart he'll rise again amen hallelujah this is not taking away your faith that should give you faith because if you can be honest enough with yourself we make mistakes paul wrote i have to die daily brother and says he's repent daily which means he made daily mistakes hallelujah but he rose again because he was an elected son he said he used to be coming to the church here years ago and they they may be this morning a little man and his wife they used to sing a song that thrilled me goes something like this forgive me lord and try me one more time i'll be yours you'll be mine if i fall if i fail let me rise and try again forgive me lord and try me one more time he says i like that for any good soldier's app to get wounded or hurt but if he's still a soldier and got a purpose and something to fight for he'll rise and try again any good soldier of the cross will do the same thing and i just want to make this real this morning let's go back to the time when they fought with swords and things right he says every soldier is sometimes going to be wounded but you're not the first time you get a cut on your arm or something give up and say i'm not going to fight anymore and walk off the battlefield you get a spear in the back of your you know in your back the more you get wounded the more you will get serious about the fight and get up again and try again because you know this is serious hallelujah so one now i want you to see the context now i'm going to speak about moses again when did god call him well i'll ask you this first when when did god predestinate him before the foundation of the earth and god predestinated him to be the deliverer of his people before the foundation of the earth i believe god saw that in his attribute right but from moses humanistic perspective when did god call him after he messed up everything sitting in the backside of the desert failing his commission seemingly failing it humanistically absolutely failing his commission when he had lost all hope of being the deliverer to lead god's people out but look at this i hope you don't mind me quoting the quotes perfect brother graham says in his failure we find out that he fled from the face of pharaoh into the wilderness but one day god heard the cry of his people god remembered that he had a covenant with those people now i want you to notice now remember now moses the failure right humanistically now not only that but he also remembered he had a servant who he has called and had chosen and he had a covenant with that servant i love that after all his mistakes go down and say oh no you failed i'm going to tear up this covenant sorry god had called him before the foundation of the earth to be the deliverer and he sat there with all his mistakes and failures and all of that and he was still god's covenant person that god was going to use to lead israel out in that first first day exodus hallelujah i want to say the vessel had lost all hope but god had no change of mind hallelujah the vessel felt it was too late the vessel felt god could never use me again hallelujah and then after all of that joshua took over and joshua could take courage god used that vessel that that seemingly been such a failure and god did wonderful things through him hallelujah that's why i love that our prophet was open about his mistakes he never tried to hid you know all those things that he did he never tried to hit the fact that he deliberately wanted to pull the wool over his wife's eyes and you know lie to her and and get you know go live off in the wilderness or or the you know the time he lied to the lawyers and and different things he never tried to hear those things he was just open with his mistakes so that you and i can get courage as i walked with moses i'll walk with you as i walked with william branham i will walk with you hallelujah i want to come to this is the the main thought now that i where i got the title from sorry let me just quickly finish that i'm sorry and god will never change his his covenant or change his desires or change anything god will always keep his promise although moses had failed him and had done that which was wrong yet god kept his covenant when god calls a man to do something he must do it just got to do it and it's got nothing to do with how messed up your life becomes hallelujah now listen to this he says now remember now he's referring to this instruction to joshua now this book of the lord shall not depart out of thy mouth so he had god's word as i was with moses move right on out and as i was with moses so will i be with you then he says i will not fail you little bride under joshua ministry i will not fail you as i was with moses i will be with you i hope you can read your own name in this you know and it must be more than god will be with brother jason and god will be with brother jason and god will be with brother matt and god will be with come on it's not just the ministry god will be with you with every last member of this bride as i was with moses now as the ministry moved over to the joshua ministry where the son of man is riding this trail once more i will be with you i will not fail you look at this you may fail me but i won't fail you i put my hand up very quickly i failed god so many times but he's never failed me hallelujah he says listen to this now listen to this attitude this is what i want to speak on this morning but if you fail me my grace is sufficient i'll bear you right back up just keep moving on god is not saying if hallelujah if you fail me i'll write you off if you fail me i'll you know put you out of the church if you fail me i'll i'll stop giving you my blessings god is not saying any of that he's saying if you fail me i will bear you right back amen just keep moving forward just keep on preaching the battle just keep on moving to that promised land just keep on moving and taking your ground hallelujah inheriting your promise as long as you stay with my word i'll take care of you it's not saying as long as you are perfect as long as you don't make mistakes as long as you keep every little letter of the word as long as your heart stays with me as long as your desire is for me hallelujah as long as that inside of the inside is still calling i'll be with you i will not fail you that's where i got the title from this morning god has your back god has your back even when you feel totally messed up god is your back when you feel you've fallen away from grace god has your back hallelujah we've made many mistakes over the years on an age level and so forth i want you to notice this now brother rahm says and how it must have felt when joshua standing there that morning talking to god he said i'll not fear fail thee and as i was with moses so will i be with you no man shall stand before you all the days of your life i will destroy and divide i'll make the way clear only be strong and courageous how did joshua feel now remember joshua's ministry was was you know you could say the capstone ministry it was a type of this time when the capstone would come down crying grace grace there'd been a change in ministry there'd been a change of administration and i'm going to say this and i trust this he's okay brother jason but it took us years to catch the change of administration it took us years to catch how it went from shout to voice it took us years to see how it went from from from man age to to eagle age how it went from church ages to bright age but it's even harder for us to see that with the trains of administration they also came a changing application a change in attitude a change in where god wants us to catch the spirit of the word and not just the letter moses was there to lay down the law to to capture those things to give us the cod books and so forth but god wants to know when he applies it i mean god applies it through that capstone that's come down grace grace i'll be with you i've got your back we together in this hallelujah god is not saying i've given you my law now let's see if you can perform it and the first time you mess up i'll crack the whip and i'll whip you and i'll chase you out and i'll do this or the other god does not do that but yet as message believers many of us did that and i'm guilty judgmental legalistic hard line outspokens cut people off sever their character we've done that well maybe you're not guilty i did so much of that you see god does not get married to a bride because of a law god gets married to a bride because of love god wants us to come into that spirit of the composer hallelujah amen god wants us to catch the spirit behind the word the spirit behind what brother brahm spoke to us or what the holy ghost spoke through brother branham god wants us to see what he wants done with his word you see it's easy to apply a law it's easy to apply a letter black and white is much much easier to work with you know i said i said to to the church back home you know even in church order it's so easy to get in a point where we just want to apply it black and white but there's you know these practical things that sometimes we need to seek the lord but that's too much work it's easier to apply the black and white but we want to find god's mind for a circumstance we can so easily miss that god used his prophet to express his mind to us we've got the same scenario brother branham pointed that out with moses and joshua god expressed his mind moses laid down the law stored up the mind of god after after god spoke to him lip to ear but when he came to application under the joshua ministry in the era of grace that's where god said i've got your back amen you see what i want you to notice is and now you know don't get me wrong i'm not saying one thing is more important than the other but but i'm just pointing out that in that portion that we read in our opening scripture god says to to joshua one time keep the word make sure that you honor it that you follow it but god says to him over and over and over don't worry don't stress i've got your back i am with you wheresoever you go god says it over and over and over and over and over amen be strong be courageous i'm with you god is saying to this bride be strong be courageous i'm with you i've got your back i've given you my word and because you're elected i know my word is important to you and i stand by my word and i want you to live my word but i know you're gonna fail me i've got your back i mean that should be such an encouragement we don't serve god out of fear a woman never gets married to a husband while she shouldn't get married to her husband out of fear right we get married to god we get we come into the spiritual union because of love and we become love slaves and love slaves become love slaves out of choice because of a love amen hallelujah the problem is many times we have a lack of intimate relationship with the capstone that's when we start pointing fingers at others and get critical and judgmental and so on let's look at a few things we did out of fear i hope this is okay you can correct this anytime perfectly in my experience we were so afraid to make grace a disgrace that many of us ended up in legalism we were so afraid of dominating females that many in the message became male chauvinists we were so afraid of jezebelism that many message churches became the nicolaitanism dominating subverting god's people bullying god's people hurting god's people we took hard lines because we became critical we acted like pharisees in the bible wow we started looking for places where we could catch out one another to feel better about where we were we made some of our own rules and i'm kind of scared to say examples because you know maybe we don't agree on some of these things so i'll leave the examples out right but in many ways we lost sight of and interpreted misinterpreted the heart of god on a church level we've got attitudes against other churches sometimes we compete with other churches or other ministries we've spoken badly about other ministries and other churches and other opinions we tried so hard to understand everything that we forgot the teacher himself we beat others and sometimes ourselves up for mistakes but more often we judge others through a different lens that we judge ourselves you know when we do something we we look for an excuse but when someone else does it they're just bad right i mean even even in psychology they they refer to this as the fundamental attribution error you look for an excuse for yourself you know let's let's just give an example brother so-and-so is late at church because he's just bad you know he's just a slacker he's just you know whatever terms you use in in in in america but when you come late for church well it looks like that he hit home for some praise god but when you come late for church you know it was things went wrong at home the traffic was bad and we look for all the excuses for ourselves but when it comes to the next person we just want to cut them off it's just like peter take that sword out right praise god but you know even though we've done all those things god still has her back amen hallelujah he had our back all along and even when we find ourselves in the backside of the desert spiritually speaking far away from the commission that god has for us god never forgets his promise we stole his elect god never forgets his covenant to us and his election stands hallelujah and god said i know the thoughts i have towards you hallelujah amen and god is going to bring us he said i will bring you to your expected end and god is individually saying i will bring you to your expected end even though you may lose hope even though you may feel you failed me hallelujah i've got your back you know we're so afraid to be seen as weak or seen as wrong or seen as unspiritual or seen as missing the mark right that many times we end up living lives of hypocrisy and preteens and we can't be real no and i believe i i know the heart of your pastor has made this a safe church where people can come and say pastor i'm battling or pray for me you know and and that is so important because otherwise we all sit at home struggling with exactly the same thing but would you afraid to say i'm battling because we have such pressure to look good and such pressure to you know everything must look so perfect for me personally and i hope this is okay but there's no value in a church that looks perfect and every heart is broken wow no value at all absolutely not it's so easy to have everyone dress right act right come into church you can hear a pin drop because the prophet said we need to hear a pin drop right it's so easy to follow the letter and have no relationship amen but if we can become free and say god has my back and i can be real and brother i'm struggling with lust brother i'm struggling with you know with with money i am struggling with whatever it is amen who cares accept that we pray for you we support you we love you we encourage you because the same god that changed me is the same god that's going to change you and god is not expecting you to change you god will change you you just need to come with a sincere heart and say god i believe this god i want this god my desire is this and the reason that desire is in my heart is because you chose me before the foundation of the earth and because you chose me i believe you placed the desire in me you've placed the thirst in me and i'm thirsting like you like that like like that uh heart to the water brook and so forth i'm thirsting to you god and god i cannot change myself right the bible says very clearly no man by thinking can add a cuber to a statue i mean none of us can change ourselves we need god to change us so why do we beat ourselves up so much when we fail i can't change myself all we can do is repent that's how the keys clicked on the day of pentecost repent and be baptized and so forth and we need to come back and just say god i'm struggling god i'm battling god please help me i repent of it lord i've messed up again and tomorrow lord i've messed up again hallelujah but let's be real we want reality we want to meet god with reality walk and we know all the while he's with us he's got our back you know it's the reality is there's very few of us in the ranks of the message that did not make the exact same mistakes as those leaders that opposed the son of man when he was on earth the first time and what makes it worse is we knew better we heard the prophet preach we read in the bible where jesus speaks to the pharisees and so forth amen we don't have time to to read it but but jesus reprimanded the pharisees on so many things praying to be seen giving arms to be seen blowing a trumpet about it and so forth fasting to be seen walking around with long faces so people would think that they are serious keeping the traditions of man you can walk in this message and keep the traditions of man you can behave with a certain set of behaviors to be accepted in the group and have no relationship with god no relationship with jesus christ people want to be looked up by others people want to be called brother or rabbi or pastor or whatever it is people want to feel that they are the spiritual one in the group that's just human nature we did exactly the same thing as those pharisees did i'll just read one portion where jesus speaks to these pharisees he says but why weren't you scribes and pharisees hypocrites oh no there's that word we've seen so much of that and i'm not pointing a finger i'm pointing a finger right here i was there for years and years and years and years hypocrites for you shut up the kingdom of heaven against men for you neither go in yourselves neither suffer you them that i entering to go in we've done exactly that i'm struggling with my life right so now i criticize everyone else break them down put them out of the kingdom he says you suffer not yourself to go in and not them either i want to use scribes and pharisees hypocrites for you compass see and land to make one proselyte and when he is made you make him a twofold more the child of hell than yourselves want another one in my church want another one in my group want another one in my doctrine but what's the point wow unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for you by tithe of mint and anise and cumin and have omitted the weightier matters of the law in other words you look at the smallest little mistake in someone in someone's life but the bigger things i mean like loving god above all else like loving your brother above all else wow right wow leave it undone you blind guide which strain it in that and swallow a camel it's the same principle why won't you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for you may clean the outside of the cup and of the platter but within they are full of extortion and excess that's exactly what i spoke to earlier we're so we're so concerned about letting the church look good or letting our family look good or you know so that we can polish our image and says i am such a good pastor and they can be full of dead men's bones i'd rather my church look bad and i know that they are walking forward every day closer to christ than having a church that looks perfect but full of dead men's bones full of extortion and access now blind pharisees cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter that the outside of them may be clean also why if the inside is clean it will clean from the inside out like the dove that's that's got that hallelujah that oil that cleans from the inside hallelujah why won't you scribe and pharisees hypocrites for your like unto whiter sepulchers which indeed appear beautiful outward but are within full of dead men's bones and all of all uncleanness even so you also outwardly appear righteous unto men but within you are full of hypocrisy and iniquity i am sorry to say but i lived there for years tried my best to study the doctrine so i can speak with the bros and you know be up with the latest and greatest that's the honest truth and i'm sorry but there's many like me i know i'm not alone want to be seen to know the doctrine so you listen and you memorize and hey and i'm not saying anything about i love the word i love the open word i love revelation but not from the perspective of trying to show trying to keep up right wow and and at the same time you put up this front when you're with people and you live this perfect little i always call it the facebook effect everyone puts on their best pictures right but meantime back at the ranch before they came to church everyone there was a big bun fight in the family and mum yelled and that door slammed and everything and you come to church god bless you brother right i was only in our house right hallelujah praise god let's be real many of us are guilty on age level guilty on a church level guilty on an individual level guilty jesus summarized it like this he says this people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth and honoreth me with their lips but their heart and god in this relationship in this union with him is it is wanting our hearts he wants our love he wants to be our everything from here god doesn't god doesn't worry about the fact that we are struggling because he's got our back but he wants our hearts because he knows if he's got our hearts the rest will fall in line and over time amen that's the crux of the matter we can have the theology without the reality the understanding but our hearts is somewhere else now so far if we're honest we can say lord please forgive me i'm sorry and his responses be strong and courageous i've got your back you're forgiven because you didn't sin willfully you were drawn away and trapped into your into those things because of your humanness how are we doing for time brother jason i have no idea okay it won't be too much longer and and i want to say again we've had a change of ministry dick amen we've had a change in administration dick but what about the change of attitude amen so far we can be all on board but we need the change of attitude and you know what i find when i speak along these terms many times people say ah brother that's the milk of the word come on give us something strong we you know we want to speak about the seventh seal well i am. i'm speaking about the union i'm speaking about the marriage of jesus christ i'm speaking about the reality walk amen hallelujah but instead of reaching out in love instead of saying to your children to young people i've got your back we've criticized we've judged we've put pressures we've ruled and threatened by fear i read that opening scripture again i just i just love it oh no it looks like i skipped over that let me just quickly read that please forgive me he says people have always fussed at me because i struck so hard at organizations oh i love this whoa this is a good quote this is it isn't the people in there that i'm striking at it's that dominating spirit that makes the people think that we are the people how's that the dominating spirit that makes people think we're it. that's a spirit of denomination that's a nicolithian spirit when we lift ourselves up above others isn't that something anyway back to isaiah we read fear not for thou shalt not be ashamed neither be thou confounded for thou shalt not be put to shame and and remember the context now although you've messed up although you've made so many mistakes although you've failed so many times now to get back up again you will not be ashamed for thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth and shall not remember the reproach of thy widowhood anymore for thy maker now under the seventh seal now thou maker is thy husband the lord of hosts is his name and thy redeemer the holy one of israel the god of the whole earth shall he be called that's the thing let's focus in our relationship with him and he will take care of the rest i'm not saying that he's not going to retire to retire you to spend time on your knees in prayer i'm not saying he's not gonna require you to repent of the things that you do wrong i'm not saying he's not gonna require you to desire to do the right things he requires those things i mean but at the same time he's saying i am your husband and i stand in for you and ty you know what brother branham says he makes a statement he says he says about husbands and wives and i don't want to get dragged too much into that but just this thought he says about husbands he says remember brother she will never be held responsible for what you do but you are held responsible for what she does now let's take that to the spiritual he is held responsible for my mistakes hallelujah wow there's nothing more wonderful than that in the world he went to the cross for my mistakes he took it upon himself brother braham says he went to the cross as sinner that's right he says god wouldn't have wouldn't have judged him if he was righteous he went on the cross as sinner with your sins and mine hallelujah those sins are paid for by the blood of jesus christ so we should be saying in my relationship with others i will treat you in that way where in the way i treat you i don't even let you remember that you made a mistake against me and the way i treat you i will not even let you remind you of the failings and the faults and the weaknesses hallelujah but the wrong approach never creates disciples the approach of cracking the whip raising the bar judging criticizing all it does is it makes a bunch of message robots where we follow a set of rules where we follow a certain behavior that is going to keep us safe good without any reality so here's where those video clips in come in that my brother referred to and let's see if it works there if it doesn't now look at this this is a this is not a christian one this is a robot that they designed in japan i think that now as you can see on the text there you can hire this robot to come perform a funeral for you and it costs you a whole lot less than actually paying for a for a priest we can create message robots i'm sorry to say it but we can so easily become message robots let's go to this next one praise the lord that's working too this is a much more sophisticated robot look at that wow i'll just say this please don't stone me but with artificial intelligence you can teach the message doctrine to a robot wow you absolutely can the technology is there you can ask this robot questions about the message and he can give you really good answers no revelation not the application but the doctrine you can teach to a robot you can teach a robot well a robot doesn't have hair that can grow long right but you can teach a robot to do's and don'ts but you cannot have a relationship with a robot now this one is probably not going to work oh it is working can you make sure the sound is up this is now a roman catholic one [Music] hi and welcome it's nice to meet you would you like to be blessed by a female or a middle class fine which one do you need may the god of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing so that you may abound in hope by the power of the holy spirit go forth in the peace of god would you like to print out your messages i guess you get the point right you cannot make disciples with the wrong approach you can make robots and and if i have to be honest i was a message robot for years but what we need is reality and we cannot be message robots and be the wife of jesus christ at the same time the problem is if the elders and the leaders and the parents operate as robots how about the poor children if we just rule by fear threaten with hell without presenting the love of christ with open arms that says i've got your back we make robots and robots can be taught knowledge robots can be taught the right behavior and and it's so important to notice that when god dealt with joshua and he said keep my word lift it up live it teach it he also said i've got your back be strong be very courageous i am with you every step you give i'm with you can we say that to our churches can you say that you are children can we say that you have families can we say that to those around us when we see them making a mistake we keep the word but i'm i've got your back i love you so as i wind down i'm just tying this together now i'll be done in a short while god made it clear to joshua to follow the word that was spoken by the prophet to walk in the things that was revealed to him but god put more emphasis on saying to joshua don't fear don't fear that you'll fail me i know you'll make mistakes you're going to mistakes to make mistakes but don't don't let the fear of those mistakes stop you from loving me don't let the fear of those mistakes stop you from walking in my word that same god is saying to the bride today my little bride you've got 1200 messages and it's recorded what i said through this moses of the last days and i want you to be careful to follow my word esteem my word acknowledge that it is my word and it's from my heart to you honor it esteem it as my word and it's not the words of a man it's not a words the words of a man from kentucky it's my words observe to do to all the word which william branham my servant commanded you turn not from it to the right to the left that you may prosper wherever you go and we say amen to that this book is that has been opened to you as as prophesied in revelations 10 shall not depart from your mouth observe to do according to all that i've revealed in my thoughts for this day and then you will make your way prosperous and you will be successful and we and many times we can we all say praise the lord hallelujah wonderful and i thank god for that and i preach that and i stand by that but he also says be strong we have a good courage don't be afraid don't be dismayed i am with you wheresoever thou goest i've got your back when you make mistakes even though you may pay for it because of the of the principle of sowing and reaping i've still got your back even though you may fail me bitterly at times i've still got your back amen is that a reality for you this morning that is god's attitude to us but how's our attitude to others we're speaking about reality now brothers and sisters we have seen way too much message robot antics we've seen way too much message pharisees and our children can see through pretense and hypocrisy amen let's live the reality when we make mistakes which we will publicly repent make sure your children knows we know we've we've wronged amen get rid of those egos ego stands in the way from reality amen when we need to make make right make right so that the people who saw you make the mistake know that you know you've made a mistake and that you're sorry for let the life of christ be really projected through us amen i believe that god wants to bring these things to our attention because it's adoption time i believe it's maturing time and this is the time of the threefold purpose where he's becoming one with his bride god wants his word to be a reality in us amen he wants it to be more than just doctrine more than just words let's pray i wasn't going to do this but i'm just going to give a moment keep your eyes closed your head is bowed if there's someone that's saying lord i want reality i want to be more than a message robot a message pharisee i want you to just express it to him with you with an uplifted hand precious father you see all these many hands up this morning father that's my desire to lord i don't want to be just a message robot father i want to have a reality of a relationship with you where i can experience lord you've got my back but also as that holy spirit works through my life lord that i can really express that to others lord father help each one of us lord help moms and dads husbands and wives ministers and deacons and oh father we all need you so much lord well father i pray that he will just have your way in our lives father help us to be quick to repent oh father help us lord that our egos and pride don't get in the way of the reality of a life lived with you father i commit the words that were spoken father lord i i know without a doubt that you were in it supernaturally father i just committed to you now father you said your word will not return to your void and we trust in that lord father we committed to you now in the precious name of our lord jesus christ amen amen the musicians can come and i'll hand over to brother jason as we sing i want to live the way he wants me to live i'm going to give until there's just no more [Music] for i could never [Music] [Music] at your testimony he wants me yes lord i want to give until there's just no more to give i want to love oh love till then just know more love for i could never never ever ah that's beautiful lift it up now let's make it a course this is your time to show your appreciation [Music] [Music] until there's just no more to give oh [Applause] [Music] [Music] amen i think it was so amazing the love of god this morning i want to go back [Music] is [Music] [Applause] think about those words [Music] bow down [Music] god [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] amen the course now of love of god altogether [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] could we rethink the ocean now or could we [Music] think about that [Music] every man [Music] what would it do [Applause] [Music] [Music] softly for me dead amen amen just play that for me softly i i i don't i hardly know what to say after a sermon like that i made so many points wrote down so many things you know i i had a great appreciation today for a real pastoral ministry and i whenever i go abroad i just always as soon as i get up i tell the people no i'm a pastor so i'm just going to be a pastor it doesn't matter that i'm in a foreign field and the pastor that's that i'm there with has confidence and uh you know brother already and i discussed today that i wanted him just to take his liberty and i appreciated a shepherd's heart today that is so in line friends with the with the philosophy of this church and you know we're all in this together aren't we i told her that that last night i said if you ask my church what is brother jason what's his main philosophy they'd say we're all in this thing together amen it's all for one and one for all i'm not interested in being a message robot [Music] and that's amazing you can get a robot to do anything you ai can actually he can he can quote the message back to you but when it comes to living that life oh my goodness friends i thought about i thought brother all right how encouraging it must have been to joshua you know these people who think they can point to human frailties in william branham and somehow that's going to discourage us how encouraging it was to joshua that he could see moses with his human frailties he could see moses make mistakes and yet god was still with him and god never changed the covenant and they did come out of egypt hallelujah amen and now god is saying to joshua the same way i was with him i'll be with you hallelujah the same way god was with william branham he'll be with you bride can you receive that today then fear not don't fear anything go forward oh god will have your back even when you fail as long as your heart stays for him amen you know i um the whole thing about choice you know it's interesting because as brother as brother already begin to talk about becoming a a love slave a slave to love the the law it's actually the law of liberty it's a law of liberty because you actually go beyond you know it it the the you make a choice you know i i i when sister debbie and i the the closer we got in our relationship i was choosing her i was choosing her i was choosing her but you know on on our wedding day our relationship had evolved to where it had went beyond choice i could now not choose otherwise she was the only girl for me and and and there was no choice i had went beyond choice it had become to that level oh i'm here to tell you something friends i can't choose otherwise than christ it's in my heart it's in my whole being it's all i want in life it's all i care about is to be a child of the king a servant of the most high god to to enjoy his righteousness and his holiness and to know that the same way i feel about him is uh just a shadow of how strong he feels about me and no matter he he god will have your back even when you fail as long as your heart stays for him because you you can have theology without reality you know friends there are sadly there are churches that if that's the way you you want it there's congregations for you this ain't one of them i'll take reality over theology any day of the week amen i want the reality we cannot be robots you just remember this you cannot be robots and the bride of jesus christ at the same time you're gonna be one of the other [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] i want to sing could we think again [Music] oh i wish i had sister gene here to sing this [Applause] [Music] [Music] i grew up hearing this [Music] it verse god of love [Music] [Applause] [Music] now here we go [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Applause] [Music] [Music] lord we love you today how we thank you as a congregation lift up those holy hands to him friends just say lord we love you today we thank you for your word thank you for coming you love him today let him know it say father thank you for coming among us thank you for bringing your word it was so clear so concise it struck every chord lord god it it described to us that this god that has called us out from the world loves us with an unfathomable love may we emulate that lord may we take it today may you be our example in all things this is what the gospel is this is what the gospel came to do the message of the hour didn't come to make us robots it came to turn the heart it came to turn our hearts toward faith we thank you for that lord that original faith that started the church 20 centuries ago we're carrying on with it today lord we're doing we're working hard father we don't always get it right but we sure do love you father we sure love your word and we want more of your presence in our lives i pray today master to to to to continue the prayer that brother already prayed lord if there's anyone in here today and say who would just be honest with you and say i'm a believer but the realities of the living god i've not allowed them to so much to live in my life i've i've kept more the legal side of it but i want to have the surging realities oh i just raise up both my hands today oh god raise up your hands if that's how you feel to say today say lord let the realities of the word be in me let the realities of the living god we want to we want to declare that you are in control here lord not men you are in control we look to you we know lord that your grace will teach us to deny ungodliness that's not in question you had already told joshua to keep the word as it had come from moses there was it wasn't a letdown in the word but you knew lord god that that kind of dry experience wouldn't hold up lord for it wouldn't hold up lord during that first exodus it wouldn't hold up at the second second exodus brother branham says when christ rose not every grave opened not every grave but every grave where that held a body that had the faith of abraham that had believed like abraham those are the ones on the second exodus on this third exodus lord oh god i want to be part of that number i want to join that throne to meet you in the air help us lord god as we strive in this quest to make it back home strengthen and encourage us today may we take this word that we've heard may it go with us lord throughout our fellowship in the day to our homes tonight may it be first and foremost on our minds today may the young people realize lord this experience with christ is something that's real it's not an imagined thing it's not a talk thing it's a it's a reality of an experience in christ we love you lord that key that same key that turned the lock that clicked the lock in the early church repent that's the same key from all your heart repenting of your whole life you don't want to be you anymore you want to be him may it be granted to us lord in everything we love you today thank you for your servant thank you for loaning him to us lord thank you for the unction of the holy spirit that spoke through him today we give all glory to you all praise to you all honor to you you're the only one worthy of it now go with us lord and keep us and may these these thoughts be made the holy spirit as you said to the disciples you don't even know you don't know fully what i do now but you know hereafter don't worry the holy spirit will bring it back to you in days to come lord the holy spirit will bring back these realities to us we commit it to you now in jesus name god bless your friends oh love of god oh love god god bless your friends [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] the saints and days [Music] shall pass away an earthly throne [Music] refuse to break on rocks and hills [Music] and mountains
