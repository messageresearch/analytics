TRANSCRIPT
========================================
do good morning everyone god bless you let's stand pray gracious heavenly father we come to you in the name of jesus christ and we ask that your spirit would be with us this morning lord i pray that you'd move upon your word make it a living reality in our hearts lord and may our may our faith be continually quickened by the spirit father be with us in every way through the through the sunday school worship preaching of the word may your name be lifted up and glorified we ask in jesus name amen amen we're going to turn in to psalms chapter 82 and i'm going to start a new topic today 80 psalms 82 verse 6 and my topic is you are elohim all right psalm 82 6. i have said ye are gods and all of you are the children of the most high may the lord have the blessing to the reading of his word you can be seated i have said you are elohim and all of you are the children of the most high and i'm going to look at a study here today and you're all of your familiar brother branham talking about this i'm just going to be honest with you every time i would hear brother branham say you are gods your deity i would go ah where is that i can't and he would of course he explains it and goes through it and i want to take that back to the scriptures and see that in detail it's really beautiful actually if you see the big picture from old testament to new testament in the fourth seal brother branham says where it had been lost by adam and eve and went back after they forfeited their rights of the word the promises their inheritance they remember they control the earth he was an amateur god for he was a son of god and a son of god is an amateur god now that ain't contrary to the scripture i know that sounds strange but jesus said if you call them who the word of god came to and what does the word of god come to prophets if you call them with the word of god come to god's how can you condemn me when i say i'm the son of god see and now they were gods and man if you become born in the family of your family name you are a son and part of your father and then when sin came in we found out that the man crossed the chasm and the blood of bulls and goats covered but did not remit until the real bleach came that could take the stain of sin and break it completely to pieces and send it back upon its original perverter that was satan when it got back to satan he waits his time of eternal annihilation now that shows what we believe we believe that he will be absolutely be done completely away and annihilated i believe that sin will be broke up and when it's confessed upon the basis of the blood of jesus christ it's like dropping a drop of black ink in a bunch of clorox bleach it just breaks it into the chemicals and sends it plum back to where it come from see and that's the way the blood of jesus christ does then that sets a man across the chasm again as a son of god and then he becomes he uh why even he the creative power of god is in him and at least whenever god command can command it to be done it'll be done and we get back that's from the fourth seal so let's let's that's the basis of what i'm talking about now um at least for this sunday school probably probably more genesis 1 1 that's where we start in the beginning elohim created the heavens and the earth elohim from the strong's concordance dictionary plural of allah it's god's in the ordinary sense but specifically used uh of the supreme god occasionally applied by way of deference to magistrates and sometimes as a superlative angels god goddesses great judges mighty etc and we'll look at that scripturally first kings 8 23 i just want to establish what this means when brother branham says we are gods he does not mean we are objects of worship so he's not using the term god in the sense of the english word which simply means an object of worship i believe he's using it in the scriptural sense of elohim and we'll see what what that means as we go forward he's also not saying that we have the same attributes as god we are an attribute of god but we in ourselves are not eternal in god we have eternal life but we in ourselves are not eternal we are not all-knowing we are not omnipresent we we we aren't those things you know god alone is that so first kings 8 23 and he said and i'm just gonna i'm going to take this it says lord god of israel but yahweh elohim of israel just so you get the picture yahweh elohim of israel there is no elohim like thee in heaven above or on earth beneath who keep his covenant and mercy with thy servants that walk before thee with all their heart there is no elohim that has attributes and in nature like jehovah there's no one like him isaiah 44 6. thus saith yahweh the king of israel and his redeemer yahweh of hosts i am the first and i am the last and besides me there is no elohim isaiah 45 verse 5 i am yahweh and there is none else there is no elohim beside me i girded thee though thou hast not known me there is no elohim beside me exodus 20 2 through 5. i am yahweh thy elohim which have brought thee out of the land of egypt out of the house of bondage you shall have no other elohim before me you shall not make unto thee any graven image or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above or that is in the earth beneath or that is in the water under the earth thou shall not bow down thyself to them nor serve them for i yahweh thy elohim am a jealous elohim visiting the iniquities of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me what are the gods of the other nations called in the bible elohim uh scripture is first kings 11 33. because that they have forsaken me and and have worshiped ashtrays the elohim female female version of the zedonians chimash the elohim of the moabites and milkham the elohim of the children of ammon and have not walked in my ways to do that which is right in mine eyes and to keep my statutes and my judgments as did david his father all right let's keep going deuteronomy 32 17. they they sacrificed unto devils not to god to elohim whom they knew not to new gods that came newly up whom your fathers feared not so here even the the devils the demons are called elohim all right first samuel 28 11 to 13. don't get stumped we'll tie it together just follow me follow me along it's the scripture you don't have to get mad at me just if you're mad at something now you're mad at god all right because it's the bible so just just slow it down all right first samuel 28 and it's 11-13 and then the woman then said the woman the witch of endor the medium of endor whom shall i bring up unto thee and he said bring me up samuel and the woman and when the woman saw samuel she cried with a loud voice and the woman spake to saul saying why hast thou deceived me for thou art saul and the king said unto her be not afraid for what sauce thou and the woman said unto saul i saw elohim ascending out of the earth not gods in plural elohim it was one person that was coming it was the prophet samuel the prophet samuel is now referred to as elohim psalm 89 5 through 8 and you could pull that up in the king james i'm going to read it out of the esv let the heavens praise your wonders o yahweh your faithfulness in the assembly of the holy ones for who in the skies or in the heavens can be compared to yahweh who among the heavenly beings is like yahweh an elohim greatly to be feared in the counsel of the holy ones and awesome above all who are around him o yahweh elohim of hosts who is mighty as you are o yahweh with your face faithfulness all around you now we're seeing an assembly in the in the heavens an assembly of holy ones keep that in your mind there we'll keep going psalm 8 4 through 6. this is also referred to in the new testament but it's very interesting what is said what is man that thou art mindful of him and the son of man that thou visitest him for thou has made him a little lower than the angels i'm not sure why they put angels there because the word is elohim you have made him a little lower than the elohim and has crowned him with glory and honor thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands thou has put all things under his feet well i can tell you why they did and that's in hebrews 2 6 and 7. wait till you pull that up brother george yeah but one in a certain place testified saying what is man that thou art mindful of him or the son of man that thou visitest him thou madest him a little lower than the angels that's for sure in the greek angelos angels thou crownest him with glory and honor and did set him over the works of thy hands so there should there should be a connection starting to form a little bit there in your mind the angels the elohim genesis 3 4 and 5 and the serpent said unto the woman you shall not surely die for god doth no for elohim doth know that in the day eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and you shall be as elohim knowing good and evil so this is the temptation of the devil tempting them with being like elohim the fact is they were already made in the image and likeness of elohim they come off of him they're a part of him they were made to have dominion over the earth what more could they have been asking for they already were elohim exodus 7 verse 1 and the lord said unto moses see i have made the elohim to pharaoh and aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet psalms 82 we're going to read through the whole chapter god standeth in the congregation of the mighty the word mighty there is the singular term for god l god standeth in the congregation of el so again this is another terminology or the assembly we saw that before the council of the holy ones this is sound probably sounding strange and weird and like you've never heard it before yeah yeah seems it was for me too so but this is this is a picture that's in all through scripture um and you'll see that so there's an assembly of l he judgeth among the elohim so in in esv it says god has taken his place in the divine council in the midst of the gods he holds judgment in the midst of the elohim and i want to go for go further verse two how long will you judge unjustly and accept the persons of the wicked selah now we're going to come right back to this but this verse that we should go back to this verse in exodus 21 verse 6. exodus 21 6 then his master shall bring him unto the judges his master shall bring him unto the elohim he shall also bring him to the door or unto the doorpost and his master shall bore his ear through with an all and he shall serve him forever so here we have judges people are set up as judges what are they called elohim all right back to psalm 8 verse 3. defend the poor and fatherless do justice to the afflicted and needy deliver the poor and needy rid them out of the hand of the wicked they know not neither will they understand they walk on in darkness all the foundations of the earth are out of course i have said you are elohim and all of you are the children of the most high but you shall die like men and fall like one of the princes arise o elohim the one true and living god judge the earth for thou shalt inherit all nations amen so let's look a little bit more at what we talked about this divine council it should be it should remind you of several things first is the story of michael first kings 22 19 through 23 it's not strange it's not a strange idea it seems like a strange idea maybe because you haven't heard it spoken of in this way before but this is the scriptural way of speaking about it however we hear it in in another sense and you'll you'll see that as i read a few more quotes and a few more scriptures first kings 22 19 through 23 and he said hear thou therefore the word of the lord i saw the lord sitting on his throne and all the hosts of heaven the council of the holy ones the divine counsel and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left and the lord said look at the council who will persuade ahab just think about it god is sitting upon a throne in theophonic form he's around him is the angels the host of heaven on his right hand on his left the divine counsel is there and he says who's going to deceive ahab we think of it simply as god decides god and god sends but god is with us he wants us to participate in the plan of salvation right he uses men but he also uses angels and he wants them to participate in the plan of redemption we all have ministering spirits around us to minister to those who are heirs of salvation right they're participating in that process like we are receiving and participating in the process for others uh who will persuade ahab that he can go up and fall at ramos gilead and one said on this manner and another said on that manner so even even god has a council meeting and he allows people to speak angels to speak freely to him we should do this oh we should do that didn't didn't didn't strike a chord with the lord at all and the lord said unto him and there came forth a spirit and stood before the lord and said i'll persuade him and the lord said him i said unto him how wherewith how how will you do it and he said i will go forth and i will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets and he said you will per you shall persuade him and prevail also go forth and do so now therefore behold the lord has put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets and the lord has spoken evil concerning the daniel 4 17. this matter this is one of the strangest verses you you ever read without getting a glimpse of this big picture it's talking about nebuchadnezzar and nebuchadnezzar's situation where he is going to be sent into the wilderness and and eat grass like an animal so that's what the that's what matter is being spoken of this matter is by the decree of the watchers the word watchers means the awake ones i would refer this back to what brother branham said and said left my brain you think the ufos are coming down and they're not ufos they are investigating angels the watchers it means they're awake ones means they're always watching you hear about a recording angel he's there recording everything that's happening so now they're saying this is by decree of the watchers well we understand what that means actually wasn't them that said it who's behind it jehovah elohim but this is saying this is a decree of the watchers and the demand by the word of the holy ones to the intent that the living may know that the most high so what is the divine council makes this decree why so that the living will know that the most high rules in the kingdom of men and gives it to whomsoever he will and sets up over it the basest of men in revelation chapter four uh in 1961 brother branham is uh speaking here on isaiah chapter six in the year that the king uzziah died i als i saw also the lord sitting upon the throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple glory what's his train there it is angels beings his train that followed him the trains that what come behind see his train filled the temple and above it stood the seraphims and each of them had six wings with twain he covered his face with twain he covered his feet and with twain he did fly and one cried unto another and said holy holy holy is the lord of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory and when the post of the door moved at the voice of him that cried in the house was filled with smoke and continuing from the same sermon here's the throne now the first at this throne is for the four living creatures outside of that is 24 just like that elders sitting upon the throne upon their thrones little thrones under and around this is great hosts of angels around the throne see what i mean they're everyone different one from another there's angels here's elders here is living creatures amen see okay so you see the picture there that's being painted god has angels that participate in his program we call them angels angels is a function right we think of angels that's the spiritual beings that watch over us they're they're spirits right they're they're uh spiritual beings some of them are seraphim they're not angels they're the throne guardians in the in the in revelation four five and six we see them and they're called living creatures or simply living beings they're not brother bands they're not beasts the four beasts they're not actually beasts they're living creatures living beings there but they're not those are not angelic beings angel is a function a spiritual being can become an angel when it brings a message to a human a human can become an angel when he brings a message to people so there's different orders uh in that but within the spiritual beings that god created there's different orders and i didn't add the scripture in to this but i'm going to pull it up i believe it's in ephesians 6 and also in colossians let me just do a quick search it's the word principalities yeah colossians 1 16 for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth visible and invisible whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things were created by him and for him so there is both visible and invisible thrones dominions principalities and powers you see in the prince of persia is one of the one of those beings those evil spirits that's spoken about in the book of daniel the prince of persia resisted gabriel from come and bringing a message to daniel and michael had to come and fight with gabriel in order to overcome the prince of persia so gabriel could come and deliver the message to daniel so there's different orders of created spiritual beings if you see it was uh the archangel michael did not dare to bring a railing accusation against satan why because satan was what what was he originally made to be what brother branham says something that to our minds seems radical but he says did you know that satan one day was co-equal with god why he's on he's on the highest level of spiritual beings that were created and so even michael the archangel says jehovah rebuked you he's not using his own authority he's using the authority of the one that's above all and so you have these different layers and levels of both visible and invisible authority and so there's those who are part of the assembly of the council of el and there's other spirits both good and evil spirits that come and have access to that throne to speak the accuser of the brethren what is he doing he's coming amongst the host of heaven to do what to accuse you and me all right i think i have to quit there we'll continue on but i want you to understand what brother branham said to say that we when we are redeemed we become sons of god and we are god we have we are deity he even says that these things are perfectly scriptural absolutely scriptural they're not they're not fantastic he's not saying we're objects of worship he's not saying some new age doctrine he's saying an old old doctrine that's from the old testament and the new testament it's beautiful let's stand heavenly father we just come to you now lord and i pray you just take these things and and uh may each one of us just search through the scriptures search through the message and get a better grasp and understanding of this lord i know there's much more to be spoken about it there's much more to go in and there's there's matters of great thankfulness and rejoicing that go on with go along with this lord and so we we just ask that your spirit would be present with each one you bless the service today that you'd move amongst us we ask it in jesus name amen god bless you you
