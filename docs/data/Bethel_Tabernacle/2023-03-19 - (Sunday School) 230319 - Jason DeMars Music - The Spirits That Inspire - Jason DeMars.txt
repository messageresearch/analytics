TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Point Let's stand and read the word I'm going to look at Ephesians 5 and my topic is music the spirits that inspire D be not drunk with wine wherein is excess or debauchery but be filled with the spirit speaking to yourselves in Psalms in hymns and spiritual songs singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord amen let's pray father we just come to you Lord and we want to commit this time to you yes that your Holy Spirit would come Lord and speak the word to our hearts father just uh pray that you'd bring this with clarity and understanding to it we ask in Jesus name amen it can be seated now my purpose of this Sunday school isn't to uh stand here and make judgments on any particular specific song or church that our church or any other message church is using I'm really not that's not even really my focus is uh what churches are doing or or so forth you know the the you may or may not be aware of different controversies that have have have went on and offended people so don't get go into vapor lock as I'm talking about music my main focus is worldly music and show basically giving you the framework of what music is and what the real purpose of music is so that you yourself can be led by the spirit and make make your own judgments uh based on the word of God and the leadership of the Holy Spirit and the character of Christ so and uh also if you're a parent to help you be able to lead your family correctly and give your kids a reason behind the rules so in the verse that we looked at there don't do not be drunk with wine wherein is excess or where which is debauchery you know there's a whole picture that goes into that in in the Greek culture it's it's it's being out of control and being under the influence of something else that is controlling you and so being filled with the spirit is but so it's the opposite and brother Branham says let me bring that quote right now and why are people so touched about that's what he done under the anointing the anointing is not emotion the anointing is supreme power in control knowing exactly what and how see so being filled with the spirit his supreme power under control right not your control but God's control you know and and God isn't leading you to act like a drunken person people say these are not drunk as you suppose but then what's the results they're speaking what the word of God in other languages they're declaring the gospel but then we see a key here that Paul gives us be filled with the spirit speaking to yourselves in Psalms and hymns so what is he saying one way that you can walk in the spirit and be filled with the spirit is by speaking to yourselves in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs so music Godly music is a key to being filled with the spirit amen and so that's what we want to talk about we want to talk about music so music really bypasses the realm of thought it bypasses the mind and goes directly to the heart so it's critical that we need to be grounded in the word of God and in the wisdom of God regarding the type of music that we listen to I'm going to look at some things that worldly people have said about music and what their music is intended to do this is someone who's written about the history of music not necessarily he's a worldly person but but looking at the history of music and the science behind it says music is the language of languages it can be said that of all of the Arts there's none that more powerfully moves or changes the consciousness you see it's something that impacts you and it changes your realm of thinking what you think about the direction of your life David Crosby you old people like me know who this is I I showed this to the junior Youth and they all laughed I'm like who in the world is that yeah well he says this to Rolling Stone magazine through my through just my music I can alter my audience's value system and in effect steal them away from their parents Jimi Hendrix I can explain everything through music you hypnotize them so that they're in their original state and then I can change their minds to anything I want so that's the music this is not just talking about the words in the music because you'll hear that and Christians say well the words are good so it's fine no heavy metal has a message without words rap music has a message without words all of the pop music Etc et cetera there's all a message behind the very sound of the music what is the meaning of the word music has anybody ever looked at that it comes from the word muse and it means someone who embodies the spirit that inspires them you saw in my first screen I had this picture there it's it's a bigger picture and it has nine different Muses and these were in Greek culture spirits that entered into a person and inspired them to do what they do so looking at the meaning of music is it's um see where I had tracing the history and the Romanian the word music its Origins it speaks of the art given by the spirits that inspire so there's a spirit Behind the Music the type of music and it is inspiring that music and putting forward a specific message that is meant to produce a certain kind of effect on you which is exactly what Aristotle wrote music has the power of producing a certain effect on the moral character of the soul and if it has the power to do this it is clear that the young must be directed to music and must be educated in it whatever his purpose was behind that it really it really doesn't matter the point is what he's saying is is an accurate statement is young people need to be educated and receive an understanding of the purpose of music and understand the background of it otherwise they're going to get get in get thrust in this game and they're they're just upon being played with by the devil you probably can't read that I'm sorry I'll read it for you there seems to be in us a sort of affinity to musical modes and rhythms I'll just explain that a second there's something inside of us that responds to modes and rhythms it's it's like built into us are the receivers to take in what music is doing good or bad and so inside of us we take that in you you can't avoid that it's like eating food if all you eat is terrible food you get fat music is the same thing for all you listen to is awful music what are you going to do you're shaping your character according to what you're listening to so he says uh there seems to be in us a sort of affinity to musical modes and rhythms he says which ensures that we are affected in a certain manner as a tangible expression of intangible realities music also had the ability to sustain and cultivate moral rectitude rhythms and Melody contain representations of anger and mildness and also of courage and Temperance and all their opposites and other ethical qualities again that's a very good way to express it music will encourage you depress you make you angry it can impact on your emotions all this way and that's why I say it bypasses your mind you're going to listen to this music and it don't matter if you say I don't like it you're in the grocery store you you hear music you can't avoid these things you go to the restaurant you can't avoid it you're trying to stop that and saying Lord give me strength to overcome I remember Avery as a little girl being so sensitive to these things we'd go into a restaurant she'd be a basket case at the restaurant I'm like just tune it out and I'm like how in the world is she gonna do that we gotta eat dinner here what are we gonna do and this music is coming and she's so Disturbed and affected and we got to go out three or four times and pray over her because this horrible music is there and and she's in the state the right State of Mind this is this is bothering me making me upset it's like brother Brandon said turn that garbage off it makes me so nervous and that's exactly it is it's bypassing our brain going to our heart producing an effect whether you want to or not you know as any of us this is any of us but as young people the devil will whisper in your ear this music sounds really good he he still tries to whisper those things to me based on music I used to like from the past that sounds really good I like it you start you don't even think you start tapping your foot you're like oh what am I what is this garbage you know it bypasses reason oh and then the devil will say the words don't really matter you just like the sound well that's just the start again this has been said by every preacher that's ever probably ever stood behind this Pulpit is the devil don't just give you the worst thing in front of you and say you want this horrible thing do you want to die not really no I don't want that no he offers look at this this is real life this is you'll enjoy this listen to this sound it's similar to this or it's similar you like that the words don't matter you know I poor young people living in this age it's so deceiving it's so evil and my own kids you're going to the grocery store and you're hearing this music over and over again and all of a sudden you hear your kid saying words of a song and you look it up and you're like do you know what are you doing listening well I hear it every day in the grocery store I'm not listening to that on at home you sure and and what what is it it's these things that are coming into them they don't even know what they're doing they don't know the spirit behind it and and they're getting into that and then if if we as parents aren't diligent they'll go long way down the road I went long way down the road and remember and I'm not I'm not trying to pigeon in on anybody or anything I'm just making the statement brother banham says the two spirits in the last days will be so close together that will deceive the very elective possible there's two Spirits working in the framework of Christianity in music to direct young people and all of us in one path or another we have to be wise I'm not here to tell you and point out this group this one this song no it's not that I agree with what brother Matt said if you heard him speak about music and worship and and taking taking songs and bringing them and and adjusting them to the right right beat and the right sound to create the right atmosphere I agree with that but but there is a great need to that in itself statement shows there's a great need to be wise and careful about this because it is two spirits and one spirit is working to set you free and to give you Joy and one spirit is working to put you in bondage to evil and not evil like you you know Satan worship pure Satan worship of you know all the nonsense that they do but uh it is a Satan worship right but it looks good it looks nice but it leads to the same destination the kingdom of darkness is real and it's the source of all opposition to God Satan is the prince of the power of the air and the God of this evil age his purpose is to do what he stimulates the lusts of the Fallen Human Nature and music is one of his greatest tools to bypass the mind the reason Logic the word of God everything and go directly and deal with your lusts and he's wants what is he doing what is he doing what does he do through worldly music he blinds people's minds to the light of the glory of God that's his purpose bind them in this blinding wickedness of sin and seeking to fulfill their lusts and their desires and he slowly and he'll do this to Christians you know people in the world they grow up with parents that don't know the Lord and don't don't love God and don't hardly love their children in a real way they might say they love their children but they're just living their life and surviving what is it they're thrust into this music and what does it do it carries them on a path you know they start out with things that are so-called you know nice sounding and not too dark and it takes them down a horrible dark path I mean there's you look at the culture of music and world of music today you don't even want to look at it to be honest with you you can't even you can't even do it you can't the things that they do at the Super Bowl halftime show and the Grammys they're openly going after the devil and not even trying to hide it anymore um you know and and the the devil's job is to desensitize us to all those things and get us going in that direction you know you're a mature Christian no those things aren't going to bother you but as a young person man those things will grab a hold of you hard um part of that is just how young people are you're not your your brains aren't fully developed till you're 25. you're not you're you're making your decisions not based on thought and taking thought and using logic and reason you're actually the the seat of your decisions until your brain is fully developed is emotions so just imagine what the devil is doing he knows what he's doing a Young Person's their their decision making process is emotion so what does he do he tap goes directly at emotion through music and what does it do you can't even make decisions correctly Romans 8 6 this is from the NLT so letting your sinful nature control your mind leads to death but letting the spirit control your mind leads to life and Pace again these are the two spirits in the world the devil is using music the holy spirit is also using music right one will lead you to life and peace one leads to death it's as simple as that how do I judge whether this music is from God or not what is it leading you to life and peace or death no it's just fun it's not no it's not just fun there's no just fun the devil wants you to think this is just fun music there's a message behind it there's a spirit behind it and if you don't if you don't recognize that little it's too late the devil wants to defile your body your mind ruin your relationship with your parents with family defile your body destroy your future I mean just just think a basic thing how fortunate if you grew up with two parents that cared about you and the devil will do everything he can to twist your mind around to forget that little fact because right now it might not be too important to you but I'm telling you when you get to be an old guy like me you'll realize you'll you'll you'll shed many tears through your life realizing of thankfulness saying Lord you gave me two parents that cared about me things weren't perfect certainly neither parent my parents were perfect but they were there for me and they love they they cared about me and yet the devil does this he puts music he puts these things to get you to forget about those things but I don't care about that my parents just want to control me you know no there's two Spirits working one wants to control you and one wants to give you life and peace and your parents if I bet if there's I would be willing to wager this I'm not a betting man but if your parents are sitting here today going to this church they're wanting to get you under the control of the Holy Spirit which leads to life and peace so I mean you should be the most thankful person in the world you should be thanking God and thanking your parents every day where am I at I got five minutes to do with the other three quarters of this Robert Johnson he is the father of rock and roll what did he do he was a horrible guitar player his his bandmates couldn't wait until he left and he left for six to eight months but what happened when he came back he was of absolute absolute virtuoso when he returned what what happened he said that on a certain Crossroads in Mississippi that he got out of his car and he made a deal with the devil and said if you give me Talent and make me a great guitar player and famous I'll give you my soul and that's what he did he sold his soul to the devil that's the foundation of worldly rock and roll music is a man that sold his soul to the devil you know lived lived lived until he's 27. died a terrible death probably murdered but they don't even really know studies show when you listen to rock and rock music and even some contemporary Christian music rats have a difficult time completing the maze in other words it limits their ability to think and discern the right choices put that into rock rap country all the pop music it's going to put young people and all of us in a position where we can't make the right choices we're under confusion but in these same studies these rats listening to Godly music or classical music it actually increased their ability to complete the maze in one of the studies when they played heavy metal it uh to the to the rats they actually started eating each other instead of completing the maze and you there's no way you can read that I'm sorry about that so this is Exodus 32 17-19 and it's just showing there's there's a there's a sound Behind the Music and when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted he said unto Moses there's a noise of war in the camp so there's that's the sound that's coming to Moses as he's coming out of the mountain coming from the presence of God here's the people what are they doing it's they're it's idol worship it's Pagan worship they're worshiping the golden calf and whatever other debauchery they're doing Joshua says it's war and he and Moses says it's not the voice of them that shout for Mastery neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome but the noise of them that sing do I hear so here is their singing the singing was like a war and I have a number of quotes I man I just can't get to all of them everyone's familiar with how brother Branham in those days called out the Beatles and um Elvis Presley and Red Foley even and you go back and listen to their music and then compare it to many many uh contemporary Christian songs on the radio and you go oh uh this contemporary Christian music is a little bit worse than than Elvis Presley and Red Foley and the things that brother Branham called out what was it again it's the process of slowly deceiving slowly bringing this process if the devil would have went straight to death metal everybody what's this trash no they it was just a little different than what they were Hearing in church right but with different words different purpose behind it I want to finish with the story of Saul and David first Samuel 16. but the spirit of the Lord departed from Saul in an evil spirit from the Lord troubled him and Saul's servant said unto him behold now an evil spirit from God troubleth thee let our Lord Now command thy servants which are before thee to seek out a man who was a cunning player on a harp notice what the Servants of Saul were good servants the Servants of the King today would say let's find a psychiatrist let's get you on medication maybe if you try some drugs it'll it'll help you out and what what it what is it what is what do they give there to Saul find out someone that plays a harp but even more than that and it shall come to pass when the evil spirit from God is upon thee that he shall play with his hand Thou shalt be well and Saul said unto his servants provide me now a man that can play well and bring him to me that answered one of the servants and said behold I have seen a son of Jesse the bethlehemite that is cunning and playing listen it's important to know the character of the person that's playing the music notice what what we have here you want you want to be delivered from Spirits there's a spirit that comes on Saul and it's troubling him and he wants to get free from that what do they do music immediately their mind went to music which is correct bring me someone who's skilled on the heart but I don't want we don't we don't want just you know some fly by night we want someone with a real solid relationship with Christ that's following the word of God that has an experience with God that has seen God move in their life that's cunning and playing he's good at playing and a mighty Valiant man and a man of war and prudent in manners and a comely person and the most important the Lord is with him wherefore Saul sent Messengers unto Jesse and said send me David thy son which is with the Sheep and we'll skip down and David came to Saul and stood before him and he loved him greatly and he became his armor Bearer and Saul sent to Jesse saying let David I pray thee stand before me for he have found favor in my sight and it came to pass when the evil spirit from God was upon Saul that David took a harp and played with his hand so Saul was refreshed and was well and the evil spirit departed from him music there's a spirit behind that music and that spirit is part of a war remember that there's a war taking place evil spirits are trying to take control by the by the power of the Holy Spirit behind God a Godly person bringing Godly music The Devil is chased away so here what here what do we see what is God's purpose for music this is where I want to close what is what is God's plan what is he trying to do with music box says the end or purpose of all music should be the glory of God and the refreshment of the human Spirit that's exactly scripture there's not another purpose besides that music has to be glorifying God so if you want to find out is this music worldly or is it from God is it glorifying God and then the second is is it refreshing my spirit those are the two things that's exactly what and Saul was refreshed David took a heart played with his hand of course David was not just merely playing with a harp he was singing worship to the Lord he was glorifying God with his harp and with his words and by this Saul was refreshed God was glorified his power was put on display and manifested through music the devil was chased away and a man was set free so you believe that music is important it's not just a side thing a person can be in in the worship this morning and be set free from an evil spirit that's the purpose of Music let's stand and pray father we love you Lord we thank you that you gave us this gift of Music Lord help us to use it right help us to honor and glorify you lord lord use it and move through it Lord in a supernatural way this morning and and through your word as well father we ask that you had set the captives and the prisoners free Lord and help us to grow in our walk with you we commit ourselves to you commit the service to You For Your Glory we ask in Jesus name amen [Music] thank you
