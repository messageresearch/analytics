[28:20] God bless you to have you in the house
[28:22] of God tonight. Special night special
[28:26] service
[28:32] &gt;&gt; I say that every
[28:38] day
[28:41] Wow. Sometimes just want to say what
[28:43] what are you waiting for?
[28:46] &gt;&gt; Oh my I say all the time that I don't
[28:49] and I mean it quite sincerely. I don't
[28:51] I'm not looking for a shortcut. I
[28:53] definitely want to finish my race. Amen.
[28:57] Don't you man. You want to be like Paul
[29:00] and and say I have finished my course.
[29:02] I've ran my race. And I believe that
[29:04] that saint of God ran it well. And I
[29:06] believe that many uh after him have ran
[29:09] it well. And I believe we are running it
[29:11] well. A lot of times we don't always
[29:12] feel like we are, but I know that uh a
[29:15] lot of it's it's equally as true that
[29:18] you don't realize just how impossible it
[29:21] is that you're that you're still
[29:24] standing for the pure word in an
[29:27] impossible age. Impossible. If it was
[29:31] not for the word that we have, there
[29:33] would be nothing, no way to keep us
[29:36] washed clean. I love the washing of the
[29:40] water of the word. I love knowing that I
[29:43] can come to the Lord and he if I confess
[29:46] my sins, the Bible says he is faithful
[29:49] to forgive me and that he and not only
[29:52] to forgive me but to cleanse me of all
[29:55] unrighteousness. And I just say, Lord,
[29:57] ever cleanse me. Amen. friends, that's
[29:59] why we're here tonight. We're going to
[30:01] uh take just a a little short um kind of
[30:05] more of an exhortation than anything.
[30:07] Don't plan to get into preaching at all.
[30:09] Uh but just want to uh reiterate some
[30:12] things that we talked about Sunday and
[30:14] we're going to go right into the
[30:16] communion service. Amen. You love him.
[30:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to um have my PowerPoint
[30:23] put up and leave you standing because
[30:24] our our opening verse will be right on
[30:27] the title screen actually. Uh so we'll
[30:29] get that up and we'll read it together.
[30:31] This is where we were on Sunday and we
[30:34] were dealing with the second installment
[30:36] in this little series. Have no idea how
[30:39] long it will go tonight. It'll be a
[30:41] third installment. But it takes from
[30:43] this passage in Ephesians 12. For we
[30:47] wrestle not against flesh and blood, but
[30:50] against principalities, against powers,
[30:53] against the rulers of the darkness of
[30:55] this world, against spiritual wickedness
[30:58] in high places. And so we have been
[31:02] studying how that this is a fact.
[31:05] &gt;&gt; This is a fact. And you're not going to
[31:08] you're not going to walk outside, I hope
[31:11] you don't, and see this image. But that
[31:14] image is real. And I know that's a
[31:17] created image, but I'm telling you, it's
[31:19] a true depiction just in a realm that
[31:22] you can't see. There are there are the
[31:26] forces of Christ and the forces of
[31:28] Antichrist battling and warfare that
[31:31] started prior to Genesis spilled over
[31:34] into the earth. And the book of
[31:36] Revelation shows us in the 12th chapter
[31:40] that you are still fighting that battle
[31:42] right now. It is as brother Brham
[31:45] uniquely coined it. Never heard it. And
[31:47] all the old manuscripts I read and all
[31:50] the old authors and commentators I read
[31:52] and spend my life doing that. I've never
[31:56] read anyone call it the greatest battle
[31:59] ever fought. Amen. Till a prophet did in
[32:03] our day. Amen. Let's pray. Father, we
[32:06] thank you for your word that we've read
[32:08] before the people. And now, Master,
[32:11] we're looking tonight. looking to you,
[32:14] Father, for some guidance. Just a few
[32:16] minutes in the word of God before we
[32:18] turn to the to the sacred elements,
[32:21] Lord, of the communion supper. It's a
[32:24] solemn assembly, as it were, Lord, on
[32:26] this last night, uh, as they say, the
[32:29] year of our Lord, 2025. Unimaginably, we
[32:32] say that, Lord, we would have never
[32:34] thought so in decades prior, even years
[32:37] prior, but here we are. So Lord, we we
[32:41] want to see your coming. We had hoped it
[32:43] would be before now. But until then, my
[32:47] heart will go on singing. Until then,
[32:49] with joy, I'll carry on. Lord, I I'm not
[32:52] turning back. I'm not turning away. I'm
[32:55] pressing toward the mark, that great
[32:58] prize, that great high calling that is
[33:01] in Christ and found only in the pursuit
[33:03] of Christ. We commit it to you now.
[33:06] Commit ourselves into your hands in
[33:08] Jesus name. Amen. God bless you,
[33:10] friends. You can be seated.
[33:13] Now, I don't know if they ever got this
[33:15] going for me. Brother Mark, you might
[33:17] have to cycle that. Let me see what we
[33:19] got here. I'll turn it off and turn it
[33:21] back on. Had a green light momentarily
[33:24] and we're not functioning. So, that's
[33:27] okay. We'll get that we'll get that
[33:28] figured out. Amen. Um, it comes on
[33:32] momentarily and then the green light
[33:34] goes back out. So, it may be a weak
[33:35] battery could possibly be. At any rate,
[33:37] you'll you'll carry that for me. Now,
[33:42] as I say, I don't want to get into uh
[33:45] any type of sermon preaching tonight,
[33:48] but you know, Sunday, we dealt with some
[33:52] things. And as we came down to the end
[33:55] of our of the Sunday sermon, I began to
[33:59] refer to you from the uh restoration of
[34:04] the bride ministry beginning under
[34:07] Luther and going all the way up through
[34:10] our day. And remember friends that that
[34:14] and I won't get this far tonight, but
[34:16] just remember where we're headed in this
[34:18] because we're going to look back again.
[34:21] I I decided to take those quotes and I
[34:24] did a awful lot of research and much
[34:27] time tracking down uh all I don't like
[34:31] to just I like to verify everything that
[34:33] my research indicates, you know, whether
[34:36] I'm using an LLM or not. I like to chase
[34:38] it all down, make sure that we're giving
[34:40] accurate information. And so you're
[34:43] actually going to see tonight I've cited
[34:45] I've used APA citations at the top of
[34:47] each statement so that anybody who wants
[34:50] to go and read some of the books I read,
[34:52] you can go and find them. And they're
[34:54] pretty accessible in this modern age.
[34:57] And I love reading those those uh great
[34:59] manage thinkers. And so uh they just
[35:03] they were anointed, you know, with such
[35:05] brilliance in their mind beginning with
[35:07] Luther and uh and under that man age.
[35:10] And it just uh it's phenomenal. And then
[35:12] when you take in the message of the hour
[35:13] and you hear things, Brother Brandham
[35:15] says, it just turns up the volume. It
[35:17] just amplifies. It's like you plugged it
[35:19] into a 10x amp and it's uh 100x and it's
[35:23] going to uh go through into the
[35:24] stratosphere. Now I So I want you to
[35:28] realize that tonight we're going to go
[35:30] back again because I felt like I rushed
[35:32] over those Sunday. I was running out of
[35:35] time. I had that um that video
[35:38] presentation I showed you. Incidentally,
[35:40] uh, if the booth can look into that, I
[35:42] had a couple of people from, um, out of
[35:45] state and overseas asking me, "Hey, we
[35:47] couldn't see the video that you were
[35:49] streaming." They could see the
[35:50] PowerPoint, but when we switched to the
[35:52] um, to the YouTube video, they couldn't
[35:54] see it. So, they'd like to see it. So,
[35:56] this Sunday, I'm going to show it again
[35:58] because I have a that was the first of a
[36:01] couple of video presentations that I
[36:03] want to show you. And uh I'm eventually
[36:06] coming from Luther and we started with
[36:08] Luther and we went to Wesley and then we
[36:10] picked up the Isuza uh revival fathers
[36:13] and I told you that I included
[36:14] Wigglesworth and Pink in there because
[36:16] they were in that era and brother
[36:18] Brandham admired those great men. I
[36:20] admire their works. I have all of their
[36:22] works and writings and have read them
[36:23] for years. And um and so and then I went
[36:27] from there to Brother Brham and I have a
[36:30] very poignant quote from him tonight and
[36:32] I have some more. I'm only going to hit
[36:34] one from him tonight, but I want you to
[36:36] bear in mind that where we're headed
[36:39] because the message didn't stay with
[36:40] Luther and didn't stop with Wesley and
[36:44] it didn't, you know, pile up with the
[36:47] Zuza revival fathers. Say it went all
[36:49] the way to Elijah. It went all the way
[36:51] to brother Brham and now the final voice
[36:54] to the final age is the bride of Jesus
[36:56] Christ. Under her messenger is the final
[36:59] voice to the final age. Now, this is why
[37:02] we're here tonight to prepare ourselves
[37:04] that in the coming new year, friends,
[37:06] we've got to take up that mantle and and
[37:10] so the Lord willing, uh, Sunday, we're
[37:12] trying to head in that direction. I
[37:15] never know definitively. I can only plan
[37:17] for it and I always do. Uh, but I'm also
[37:20] known to get hijacked on the way to the
[37:22] pull pit and that can happen. So, we'll
[37:25] see. Amen. But you're here tonight. I'm
[37:27] here. The Lord's here and we're going to
[37:28] look at this. Is that all right?
[37:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, here is the last quote that
[37:32] we stopped with on Sunday because I want
[37:35] to recapture your mind to that allimp
[37:38] important line. He says, "Maybe in this
[37:41] great day of prosperity that we've been
[37:44] so interested in prosperity till we have
[37:47] left off the main thing. Maybe we have
[37:51] gone off on some kind of a tantrum
[37:54] without him." You'd have to go back.
[37:56] That's a little bit of an archaic
[37:58] language Brother Brandham is using. It's
[38:00] an oldfashioned way of, you know, uh,
[38:03] and I'll I'll break that down more
[38:04] Sunday. I don't want to get into the
[38:06] trenches of that tonight, but a lot of
[38:08] times things can just creep into our
[38:10] life. And we're believers. We don't we
[38:13] don't not become believers. We don't
[38:15] lose our salvation. We don't get unborn
[38:18] again. Uh but but it's the devil's
[38:21] business to distract you and keep you
[38:24] from being the enforcer of all of God's
[38:27] words and to be the continuing
[38:30] expression. He's trying to that's what
[38:33] he did in Genesis. Brother Brandham said
[38:35] he cut off God's entire expression. And
[38:38] so the whole plan of redemption, get get
[38:40] it. This is important. The whole plan of
[38:42] redemption has been restoring that
[38:44] expression and taking it forward like it
[38:47] should have went from the Garden of
[38:49] Eden, but it was interrupted and we're
[38:51] in the last stages. Hallelujah. Oh, the
[38:55] last names on that roll are just about
[38:57] ready to be taken home. Amen. So, so we
[39:01] don't want to be distracted from the
[39:03] main thing. The main thing. And uh I'm
[39:06] starting with brother Brandham saying
[39:07] that and you're going to find out that
[39:09] when I use my last quote of brother
[39:11] Brandham, it really is a circling back
[39:13] to make this point. He's not using that
[39:15] language, but you'll see why here in a
[39:17] minute what the real main thing is. So
[39:21] if you'll just indulge me for a few
[39:23] minutes, I want to start back and and
[39:25] and peruse those quotes that I gave you
[39:28] Sunday. We rushed through them. I felt
[39:30] like I didn't do them justice. And I
[39:32] want you to to take them in tonight and
[39:35] absorb them. When I say I'm going to go
[39:37] through them quickly, I'm not going to
[39:38] go through them so quickly you can't sit
[39:40] and absorb it because we're about to
[39:42] come to the Lord's table. And I want you
[39:45] to realize the warfare that we are in. I
[39:49] remember and I might say it more more
[39:51] times as the series goes along. It was
[39:53] one of the last statements I made in the
[39:56] first installment. I made it Sunday in
[39:58] the second installment. We are at war.
[40:01] and I don't plan to lose it.
[40:04] &gt;&gt; We're predestinated not to lose it. See,
[40:07] but that's not that's not pixie dust
[40:10] sprinkled on you. It's not Peter Pan. Th
[40:13] this is not something just falling out
[40:15] of a tree and hitting you on the head.
[40:17] This is this is God's provision of
[40:20] weaponry, but you got to pick it up and
[40:23] put it on and keep it keep it working.
[40:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. That is the secret to an
[40:30] overcomer's life. And I don't know about
[40:32] you, but as a Christian, I want to be an
[40:35] overcomer.
[40:38] &gt;&gt; I want that. So, I want to overcome. You
[40:41] say, "What all do you want to overcome?"
[40:43] Everything.
[40:44] &gt;&gt; I want this flesh to be so completely
[40:47] under the control of the Holy Spirit.
[40:50] And I'm striving for it. I'm I'm
[40:52] pressing for it. Like Paul said, I'm
[40:54] constantly pressing for it. Amen. So,
[40:56] let's go back and you just come with me
[40:59] to uh ages past and we'll look at these
[41:02] messengers and I want you to evaluate
[41:03] these statements clearly. As I say, I've
[41:06] researched them for authenticity and you
[41:09] have the uh citations in APA style at
[41:11] the top. This is Luther on the armor of
[41:14] God. Let me turn put it here so I don't
[41:15] have to turn around.
[41:17] So, Luther begins by saying St. Paul
[41:21] tells the Ephesians, "If you wish to be
[41:24] strong and invincible,
[41:27] &gt;&gt; let the Lord let let allow permit let
[41:32] this mind be in you.
[41:34] &gt;&gt; Let the word of God dwell in you richly.
[41:36] Permit that allow that." St. Paul tells
[41:39] the Ephesians, "If you wish to be strong
[41:42] and invincible, yay, Lord, let the Lord
[41:45] Christ be your strength. Take hold of
[41:48] him." That's a proactive statement.
[41:51] That's not passive. I If you walk past
[41:54] me, the only way I take hold of you is
[41:57] if I take hold of you.
[41:58] &gt;&gt; See, take hold of him. This is your
[42:01] fifth church age messenger.
[42:04] &gt;&gt; All right. He's under the uh anointing
[42:06] of the man age, anointed by God to
[42:09] figure these things out. Uh let Christ
[42:13] be your strength. Take hold of him and
[42:16] exercise yourselves in him. Such an
[42:19] important statement that he is well
[42:22] known to you and preserve his word in
[42:26] its purity. Learn it diligently. Use it
[42:30] daily. So this is why brother Brandham
[42:32] would say, "Brother Brandham, how do we
[42:34] get closer to God?" Read your Bible and
[42:36] pray. Did you know that Martin Luther
[42:38] required of his students and felt that
[42:40] every Christian should memorize by heart
[42:43] the entire book of Romans?
[42:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:46] &gt;&gt; And be able to recite it by heart. I
[42:48] haven't got there yet. So, I'm going to
[42:50] have to be a little embarrassed when I
[42:51] see brother Martin say, "Brother Martin,
[42:53] I didn't quite get there. Uh, but I had
[42:55] a lot more information to memorize than
[42:57] you. So, give me a give me a pass.
[43:01] I had to cover a lot more ground. You
[43:02] had a very little bit. You didn't know
[43:04] it at the time. But I'm glad he had
[43:06] this.
[43:08] &gt;&gt; See, so you exercise it and and and and
[43:12] he was tapping in on the secret that the
[43:14] word of God when it's anointed by the
[43:16] Holy Spirit is impregnated with changing
[43:19] power. We're washed clean by the washing
[43:23] of the water of the word. He sent his
[43:26] word and healed the people.
[43:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. The word of God is health to all
[43:33] your flesh.
[43:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[43:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. See? All right. Learn it
[43:38] diligently. So, read it. Use it daily.
[43:43] Next.
[43:45] Impress it upon your mind and soul with
[43:49] such intensity that God's word and your
[43:53] heart by and by become one and the same
[43:57] thing. Brother Brandham said that. He
[43:59] said, I in in in Israel worthy of the
[44:01] gospel, don't read ahead of me. He said,
[44:03] "I want it so much that that his his
[44:06] mind and my mind will be the same. That
[44:08] his word and my mind will be the same
[44:11] thing." See, and uh and he says that and
[44:14] be one in the same thing. So that you
[44:17] may be sure in your confidence, more
[44:20] certain than of your own life. ARE YOU
[44:24] SURE YOU'RE ALIVE?
[44:25] &gt;&gt; Are you sure?
[44:27] &gt;&gt; You should be more sure of this than
[44:29] that. See, if you have done that, then
[44:32] you are really strong and firm and will
[44:36] remain unconquered and secure. Blessed
[44:40] be the name of the Lord. What John
[44:42] Wesley with my citations at the top.
[44:45] Ephesians 6:11.
[44:48] Wesley quoting in his in his verse by
[44:50] verse which I have. Um, put on the whole
[44:53] armor. You can see his oldfashioned way
[44:56] of spelling it. Put on the whole armor
[44:58] of God. The Greek word word means a
[45:01] complete suit of armor. This was
[45:03] Wesley's big thing. You got to wear it
[45:05] all. See, believers are said to put on
[45:09] the girdle breastplate shoes to take the
[45:12] shield of faith and the sword of the
[45:14] spirit. The whole armor as if the armor
[45:18] would scarce stew. It must be the whole
[45:22] armor. It must be the whole armor. This
[45:27] is re this is repeated verse in verse 13
[45:32] because of the strength and and sub and
[45:35] subtlety of our adversaries and because
[45:39] of an evil day of sore trial being at
[45:44] hand
[45:45] &gt;&gt; and how
[45:47] &gt;&gt; oh brother John if you only knew brother
[45:51] you had no idea many times we would say
[45:54] oh for your simple day brother where
[45:56] where women dressed like ladies 100% on
[45:59] the streets where where the bad parts of
[46:01] town were kept away from the town and
[46:04] where schools used the Bible as their
[46:06] primmer.
[46:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. And where governments prayed
[46:09] before they began sessions. How we'd
[46:11] love to return back to those days of
[46:13] innocence. And he is saying you need all
[46:16] of the armor in that day
[46:20] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE CALLED THAT AN EVIL day of
[46:24] sore trial being at hand. Does this
[46:27] inform your thinking? Does this speak to
[46:29] you? It speak it spoke to me
[46:30] tremendously as I read over these
[46:33] statements. He goes on Wesley explained
[46:36] that in the evil day uh times of intense
[46:39] trial, this is a commentator comment
[46:41] commenting on his life. The goal is, and
[46:44] now he's quoting him, quoting scripture,
[46:47] having done all to stand. This means,
[46:49] now we're back to Wesley's teaching.
[46:51] This means after preparing and doing
[46:54] everything,
[46:56] the Christian must still keep on the
[46:58] armor, STAND STILL STAND UPON GUARD,
[47:02] STILL WATCH AND PRAY.
[47:05] &gt;&gt; SO after you've done everything to be a
[47:07] Christian, you're only getting started.
[47:09] You still have to keep on all the armor
[47:13] and you have to keep standing and YOU
[47:15] HAVE TO STAY on guard and you HAVE TO
[47:17] STAY AT WATCHFUL and in prayer
[47:21] &gt;&gt; for Wesley's evil day.
[47:23] &gt;&gt; What about yours?
[47:25] &gt;&gt; What about the ones your the day your
[47:28] children face?
[47:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:33] &gt;&gt; There's nothing you can do. How we'd
[47:36] like Brother Brandham said that. He
[47:37] said, "How many times I'd think I'd like
[47:39] to take my children and raise them back
[47:41] in the wilderness with the Indians." And
[47:43] he said, "Then of course I find out
[47:44] there's bad Indians. It it doesn't the
[47:47] evil the evil is all over the earth."
[47:49] See, so he goes on,
[47:53] "By preserving in full alertness and
[47:56] prayer, we will be enabled to endure
[48:00] unto the end and stand with joy,
[48:03] hallelujah, before Christ's face."
[48:06] Omission of any part of the armor or
[48:11] corresponding spiritual duty leaves a
[48:15] believer vulnerable.
[48:17] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[48:18] &gt;&gt; That's a pretty stiff statement.
[48:20] &gt;&gt; Next. Whoever fights the powers of hell,
[48:25] how many warriors?
[48:27] Whoever fights the powers of hell needs
[48:31] every weapon God provides. He that is
[48:35] covered with armor from head to foot and
[48:38] neglects even one thing will be foiled
[48:42] after all. In short, the want of any one
[48:45] thing makes him incomplete.
[48:48] Six church age messenger that is
[48:51] straight from the six church age
[48:52] messenger that the want of any one thing
[48:56] in all your pieces of armor make you
[48:59] incomplete and make you vulnerable. And
[49:02] if it makes parents vulnerable, it makes
[49:04] children vulnerable. If it makes
[49:06] preachers vulnerable, it makes
[49:08] ASSEMBLIES VULNERABLE. I SAY WE PRESS
[49:10] TOWARD THE MARK, FRIENDS.
[49:12] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[49:15] Moving into the 20th century, the Isuza
[49:18] fathers on the armor of God. AMA
[49:21] citations at the at the top.
[49:24] This is Seymour and Parm and John G.
[49:27] Lake and Frank Barlam. Um,
[49:31] yeah. And so they I had smile in there
[49:34] also, but um he was kind of really kind
[49:37] of prior even prior to the Welsh revival
[49:40] over the pond and he was uh he was a
[49:42] Baptist and so he got involved in it
[49:44] kind of early but he's not perfectly
[49:46] speaking. Some list include him. I
[49:48] decided not to. Here's your um Barlaman
[49:51] and Lake and Pum and Seymour. We must be
[49:56] living witnesses in these last days when
[50:00] the power of hell and the clouds of
[50:04] darkness are gathering over this old
[50:06] world. This is 1906.
[50:12] &gt;&gt; 1906.
[50:15] &gt;&gt; I mean th this is now in in Revelation.
[50:17] This is just at the time when uh uh the
[50:22] the book of Revelation shows an angel
[50:24] fall like a star falling from heaven and
[50:27] brother Brandham ties it back to Lucifer
[50:30] in Isaiah 12. How art thou fallen from
[50:32] heaven, oh Lucifer, son of the morning.
[50:34] And that angel is Lucifer, identified by
[50:36] a prophet with a key given a special
[50:39] authority to unlock the bottomless pit
[50:43] and release pent up evil
[50:46] &gt;&gt; to stream into the world. And that's why
[50:48] it didn't take long after that for World
[50:51] War I,
[50:52] &gt;&gt; Amen,
[50:53] &gt;&gt; which had never happened in the earth.
[50:55] It had never been global war. So, you
[50:57] hear of wars and rumors of wars. Jesus
[50:59] said the time is not that those things
[51:01] must be. But now it's becoming to the
[51:03] woes. First woe, second woe, third woe,
[51:04] and the whole woes go one, two, three to
[51:06] sweep mankind from the face of the
[51:08] earth. And so we realize that this is
[51:11] the time. And brother Brandham in his
[51:13] language would say the lids torn from
[51:16] hell
[51:17] &gt;&gt; and demon powers are streaming INTO THE
[51:20] EARTH. 1906, HERE'S WHAT they're saying.
[51:23] We must be.
[51:25] &gt;&gt; Everybody say must be.
[51:27] &gt;&gt; We must be. THESE ARE YOUR PENTECOSTAL
[51:30] FATHERS. We must be living witnesses in
[51:34] these last days when the powers of hell
[51:37] and the clouds of darkness are gathering
[51:39] over this old world. Next, hearts and
[51:43] hearts are hardened by sin. You have no
[51:46] idea, brothers. Hardened by the curse of
[51:49] the age. You have no idea, brothers.
[51:51] That is resting upon the world. Oh my
[51:54] goodness, friends. And I think that we
[51:56] have become living witnesses of
[51:58] everything these messengers feared the
[52:00] worst of.
[52:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:02] &gt;&gt; Next, God is going to require of us the
[52:08] souls of men. Brother Brandham preaches
[52:10] it like this. We must have on the whole
[52:14] armor of God and be able be able be able
[52:20] to quench all the fiery darts of the
[52:23] enemy. born in the late 1800s, died
[52:26] somewhere around the early 50s. Arthur
[52:28] Pink, next slide. Uh this was brother
[52:31] Brandham uh admired Pink, read from uh
[52:34] some of his stuff and there are
[52:36] statements brother Brandham takes that
[52:37] are straight out of the sovereignty of
[52:39] God. The brother Arthur Pink wrote the
[52:42] wrote the book The Sovereignty of God
[52:44] and he wrote it and put a bunch of
[52:45] different categories and uh my dad came
[52:48] across that book when he was a young
[52:50] believer and he liked it so well he gave
[52:52] a copy to brother Perry Green and
[52:55] brother Perry told him later he said
[52:58] Eddie he said I loved it so much I went
[53:00] to give it to brother Brandham and
[53:01] brother Brandham said oh brother Perry I
[53:03] have that book on my nightstand I read
[53:04] from it every night.
[53:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:07] Put on the whole armor of God that you
[53:12] may be able to stand against the ws of
[53:16] the devil. Verse 11, our first need is
[53:20] to stir up ourselves to resist
[53:23] temptation by a believing reliance upon
[53:27] God's allsufficient grace. So he's
[53:30] FORGIVEN YOU.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; GET TO FIGHTING.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; HE'S FORGIVEN YOU.
[53:35] &gt;&gt; GET TO FIGHTING.
[53:37] YOUR PAST IS GONE. GET ON THE FRONT
[53:39] LINES. I I KNOW YOU YOU'D RATHER NOT
[53:42] THINK ABOUT IT. I KNOW WE'RE ALL ASHAMED
[53:43] OF OUR PAST, BUT HE HAS HE HAS CLEANSED
[53:46] ME FROM all unrighteousness
[53:50] &gt;&gt; by believing re by a believing reliance
[53:53] upon God's allsufficient grace. That is
[53:55] obtaining from him the strength which
[53:58] will enable us to go forth and fight
[54:02] against the foe. Our second greatest
[54:06] need is to be wellarmed for the conflict
[54:10] into which we must daily enter. So
[54:12] notice he broke it into a first. Your
[54:14] first thing is to rely on him and his
[54:16] word and his grace. SECOND THING IS THE
[54:19] ARMOR. See this is the relation between
[54:23] verses 10 and 11. Be strong in the Lord
[54:28] first.
[54:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:30] &gt;&gt; Put on the WHOLE ARMOR OF GOD SECOND.
[54:33] AMEN.
[54:33] &gt;&gt; SEE, so first stir up yourselves to
[54:37] resist temptation,
[54:39] seeking strength at the beginning of the
[54:42] day for THE CONFLICT, NOT FOR maybe a
[54:45] conflict, for the conflict. I hope you
[54:48] started today getting yourself READY TO
[54:52] BE A CHAMPION TODAY.
[54:53] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[54:55] THEN SEE TO it then after you've done
[54:57] that see to it that you take unto
[55:00] yourselves put on the whole armor of
[55:03] God. So Pink is preaching and this is
[55:08] some of my own alignment here. So Pink
[55:11] is is saying to us strength before
[55:14] armor, communion before conflict,
[55:19] dependence before defense.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; Does that make sense? SO THERE'S THERE'S
[55:24] A METHOD TO THIS. AMEN. So the CHRIST
[55:28] NOW NOW HERE'S A COMMENTATOR commenting
[55:30] on something Pink had to say. The
[55:32] Christian's first need is not equipment
[55:36] but strength drawn from the Lord himself
[55:40] maintained
[55:41] by a living practical fellowship WITH
[55:46] CHRIST. WITHOUT that armor won't help
[55:50] much at all. Amen.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; Without maintaining a living, PRACTICAL
[55:58] FELLOWSHIP WITH CHRIST, without
[56:00] maintaining daily a living, PRACTICAL
[56:04] FELLOWSHIP WITH CHRIST, ARMOR WON'T DO
[56:07] YOU MUCH GOOD AT ALL.
[56:09] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[56:09] &gt;&gt; SEE, Saul's armor wouldn't work for
[56:12] David. You understand? BECAUSE THAT WAS
[56:15] ECCLESIASTICAL ARMOR. ECCLESIASTICAL
[56:18] ARMOR IS BIBLE MEMORIZATION WITHOUT THE
[56:21] SPIRIT OF GOD TO QUICKEN IT IN YOUR
[56:23] LIFE. SEE,
[56:25] &gt;&gt; THAT'S NOT THAT'S NOT EFFECTIVE. BROTHER
[56:27] BRANDON WOULD SAY, "SATAN DOES NOT CARE
[56:28] HOW RIGHT YOU ARE IN YOUR DOCTRINE. HE
[56:30] DOESN'T CARE HOW RELIGIOUS YOU ARE."
[56:32] SEE, it's about the life. All right.
[56:34] Now, I got to keep moving. And so for
[56:36] this reason, I included FF Bosworth
[56:39] because I've said to you many times,
[56:41] I've never showed you the exact quote,
[56:43] but when Bosworth in his Christ the
[56:46] healer is commenting on James 4:7,
[56:48] "Submit yourselves therefore to God.
[56:51] Resist the devil and he will flee from
[56:53] you." Bosworth says the Holy SPIRIT
[56:56] TELLS US TO SUBMIT OURSELVES TO GOD
[56:59] BEFORE HE says resist THE DEVIL BECAUSE
[57:02] NO ONE HERE'S A GREAT VETERAN OF THE
[57:05] ISUZA REVIVAL, BROTHER BRANDHAM'S BOSOM
[57:07] FRIEND. NO ONE CAN SUCCESSFULLY RESIST
[57:11] THE DEVIL until he submits himself to
[57:13] God. See,
[57:16] &gt;&gt; when the devil is thus resisted, HE WILL
[57:20] NOT MERELY walk away, but he will
[57:23] literally run or flee from you.
[57:26] Hallelujah. THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO SEE,
[57:29] FRIENDS.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Y'all calm down. I'm not supposed
[57:32] to be preaching.
[57:34] to Wigglesworth who was uh there in
[57:37] England and had such a dynamic
[57:39] supernatural ministry. Second only in in
[57:42] in all the in all the MINISTRIES I'VE
[57:44] STUDIED AND I'VE STUDIED PRETTY MUCH ALL
[57:46] OF THEM OVER my whole life of years. Um
[57:49] it it Wigglesworth would almost have to
[57:52] be second only to William Brandham in
[57:54] the amount of supernatural
[57:56] that that happened on in his life on a
[57:59] daily basis. It didn't matter where he
[58:01] was on a ship, in an elevator, walking
[58:04] into a bank, walking into church. People
[58:06] would stop him. He would command demons
[58:08] out of people on the spot. Raise the
[58:10] dead.
[58:12] This and and and as his as he's dying
[58:14] and leaving the earth, William Brandham
[58:16] is coming on the scene and Elijah and
[58:18] and and he's being and brother Brandham
[58:20] is being called to the ministry and it's
[58:22] going to go forward there. And I don't
[58:24] remember I don't have the years of how
[58:25] that phased out and one phased in but uh
[58:28] it's right in that time frame. So
[58:30] Bosworth um I mean I'm Wigglesworth
[58:34] Wigglesworth. I hope I said Smith
[58:35] Wigglesworth. It's this the next guy
[58:37] Smith Wigglesworth. Uh next uh frame.
[58:43] Oh, there we go.
[58:46] Now listen to this. There's your APA at
[58:48] the top.
[58:51] If one thing, this is a man who
[58:54] constantly did miracles, raised the
[58:56] dead, healed the sick, cancers, didn't
[59:00] matter what it was, he would command the
[59:01] devil to leave and the devil would
[59:03] leave.
[59:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:04] &gt;&gt; Time after time, hundreds and thousands
[59:06] of times, he was influenced coming out
[59:09] of the Welsh revival in 03 or no 0405.
[59:14] And then it comes across the pond, hits
[59:16] Isuza in '06, and Wigglesworth is in
[59:20] England. He's going wide open under he's
[59:21] he's in the Pentecostal revival. If one
[59:24] thing is permitted outside the will of
[59:28] God, it hinders us in our standing
[59:32] against the powers of Satan.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; We must allow the word of God to judge
[59:38] us, lest we stand condemned with the
[59:41] world. Anything.
[59:44] Anything that hinders me from dying to
[59:47] self. Don't read. Look at me. Anything.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; ANYTHING. YOU'VE ALL GOT YOUR ANYTHINGS.
[59:55] I GOT SOME ANYTHINGS.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; AND I'VE HAD TO SAY I'M I BELIEVE,
[1:00:00] BROTHER WIGGLESWORTH, THAT ANYTHING THAT
[1:00:02] I ALLOW IN MY LIFE THAT HINDERS ME DYING
[1:00:05] COMPLETELY,
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; that's a problem. Amen.
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; Now, brother, brother Joel USED TO
[1:00:10] ALWAYS SAY, "PRAISE THE LORD, I AIN'T
[1:00:12] GOT A PROBLEM." CUZ YOU GOT A PROBLEM,
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; but I But YOU WANT TO KEEP THAT PROBLEM,
[1:00:16] THEN I GOT A PROBLEM.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; SO, we don't want to. We all got
[1:00:21] problems. I DON'T WANT TO KEEP THEM.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; I don't want you TO KEEP THEM. LET'S GET
[1:00:25] RID OF THEM.
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; LET'S COMMIT THEM TO GOD TONIGHT AND
[1:00:29] TAKE THE LORD'S SUPPER AND SAY, "LORD,
[1:00:30] I'M GOING INTO 20 26 AND I'M NOT GOING
[1:00:33] TO CARRY THAT PROBLEM WITH ME ANYMORE."
[1:00:35] Anything
[1:00:37] that hinders me from dying to self,
[1:00:41] separating from the world, cleaning my
[1:00:44] life up, or entering through the narrow
[1:00:47] gate, anything that interferes with that
[1:00:51] is Satan's power. Un, and he quotes
[1:00:54] Jesus, unless a grain of wheat falls in
[1:00:56] THE GROUND AND DIES, it remains alone.
[1:00:59] Brother Brandham took off on that so
[1:01:01] many times. You've got to die and rot
[1:01:03] and be born again completely. See? All
[1:01:07] right. And that's AND THAT'S THAT'S NOT
[1:01:09] JUST THE MACRO. THAT'S THE MICRO. I
[1:01:12] MEAN, IN THE MACRO PICTURE, I'M BORN
[1:01:14] AGAIN. SO, I I HAVE DIED AND BEEN BORN A
[1:01:17] NEW TO CHRIST. BUT IN THE MICRO NOW, I
[1:01:19] STILL GOT DAILY I STILL GOT PROBLEMS
[1:01:21] WITH THIS FLESH. I STILL HAVE TO LET
[1:01:23] THOSE THINGS DIE. AND AND WHEN THEY TRY
[1:01:26] TO COME BACK UP CUZ THIS FLESH AIN'T
[1:01:27] DEAD YET. I GOT TO KILL IT AGAIN AND
[1:01:30] AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; WHY DO YOU THINK PAUL SAID I I KEEP
[1:01:34] UNDER I BEAT MY BODY TO KEEP UNDER IT.
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; SEE? AND SO AND SO HE'S NOT TALKING
[1:01:39] ABOUT LASHING HIMSELF. HE'S TALKING
[1:01:42] ABOUT CONDUCTING HIMSELF IN SUCH A WAY
[1:01:44] THAT THE DEVIL CAN'T GET to him.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; AND SO WIGGLESWORTH GOES ON, a halfway
[1:01:53] dedication won't do.
[1:01:57] Don't read. I promise you. Listen,
[1:02:01] Brother Jason's been around a while. I
[1:02:03] promise you, a halfway dedication will
[1:02:07] leave you baldled up in a corner crying.
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; And regretting,
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; saying, "Lord God, what happened to me?"
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; A halfway dedication won't do. Total
[1:02:20] yieldedness to God is required so that
[1:02:24] no is left in our spiritual armor.
[1:02:27] Only a yielded consecrated holy life can
[1:02:32] become as he said a flame of fire in
[1:02:36] God's hands.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; One quote here from brother Brandham.
[1:02:45] Take on the whole armor of God. 1962.
[1:02:51] Like Peter was, he was good with his
[1:02:54] sword. When Jesus got in trouble, he
[1:02:56] pulled out his sword. He could flop any
[1:02:58] way. Cut the high priest, his servant's
[1:03:01] ear off with a sword. But when it come
[1:03:04] to real Christian courage,
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; he didn't have it.
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; He had a courage. He had a zeal.
[1:03:17] But when it come to real Christian
[1:03:19] courage, he didn't have it.
[1:03:23] He could duel the creed just as good as
[1:03:26] anybody. I mean, there's a lot of, you
[1:03:29] know, c can I just say, and please,
[1:03:32] you're going to have to let me explain
[1:03:33] this because you're going to maybe I
[1:03:35] don't want it to sound come out the
[1:03:36] wrong way. Are you a message believer or
[1:03:38] are you a real Christian?
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you, brother Bradley.
[1:03:47] I'm both.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm because I'm a real Christian.
[1:03:52] I'm a message believer, but not the
[1:03:54] other way around.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; JUST BECAUSE I'M A THE DEVIL'S A MESSAGE
[1:03:58] BELIEVER.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; THEY KNOW IT'S THE TRUTH. AND ANYBODY
[1:04:05] THAT GOES TO WITH WILLIAM BRANDON, WHEN
[1:04:07] WILLIAM BRANDON STOOD THERE IN CHICAGO
[1:04:09] and challenged those doctors OF
[1:04:10] DIVINITY, BRING YOUR BIBLE AND DISPROVE
[1:04:13] ANY ONE OF MY TEACHINGS. THEY COULDN'T
[1:04:15] DO IT. THEY DIDN'T EVEN TRY TO DO IT.
[1:04:17] THEY DIDN'T EVEN WANT TO TRY TO DO IT.
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; SO, IT'S NOT ABOUT IT'S NOT ABOUT BEING
[1:04:21] CONVINCED mentally and being a believer.
[1:04:24] MESSAGE CHURCHES have people who sit in
[1:04:26] them who believe God SENT A PROPHET WHO
[1:04:28] ARE NOT REAL CHRISTIANS.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; THEY I'M NOT SAYING THEY DON'T LOVE
[1:04:33] JESUS. I'M NOT SAYING THEY DON'T LOVE
[1:04:35] I'M NOT SAYING THEY DON'T WANT TO BE A
[1:04:37] CHRISTIAN. I'M JUST SIMPLY SAYING THERE
[1:04:38] ARE SOME WHO HAVE NEVER COMPLETELY DIED
[1:04:41] OUT AND BEEN BORN AGAIN BY THE SPIRIT OF
[1:04:43] GOD. SO THAT THEN THE MESSAGE ISN'T JUST
[1:04:46] HERE, it's here. AND WHEN IT'S HERE, IT
[1:04:48] COMES OUT OF HERE. AND THAT'S WHEN THE
[1:04:50] DEVILS WILL MOVE.
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; That's when that's ONLY WHEN BECAUSE YOU
[1:04:55] DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'LL FACE.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; I I I HAD SOME SOME MEN COME OUT THIS
[1:05:00] MORNING to put a building A STORAGE
[1:05:02] BUILDING BEHIND MY HOUSE. I WAS I DIDN'T
[1:05:04] GET up expecting what was about to
[1:05:06] happen to me. They he told me he said
[1:05:09] when I got bought it the other day, he
[1:05:10] said, "Can we come early?" And I said,
[1:05:11] "You're talking to the right man." And I
[1:05:13] said, "My dad said it should be a
[1:05:15] federal law that every man's out of the
[1:05:16] bed at 5:00 a.m. I wake up early." And I
[1:05:19] said, "You can't get there too early for
[1:05:20] me." He said, "Okay, thank you." I My
[1:05:23] phone took a hit this morning. I looked
[1:05:25] at it like 2 minutes AFTER 600. WE ON
[1:05:27] THE WAY. I'M LIKE, "IT'S DARK OUTSIDE."
[1:05:31] They pulled up in THE DARK AND WE USED
[1:05:32] FLASHLIGHTS AND THEY GOT IT around
[1:05:34] there. Really? Some nice guys at
[1:05:36] Gracland Buildings. If you ever want to
[1:05:38] meet some nice guys, those are great
[1:05:39] guys. Brother Mark turned me on to those
[1:05:41] to those buildings up there. I'm so glad
[1:05:43] I got that. And uh and he had a helper
[1:05:45] with him, a black gentleman. And and
[1:05:48] it's and as soon as he got OUT OF THE
[1:05:50] TRUCK, HE DIDN'T KNOW I WAS A PASTOR. HE
[1:05:52] DIDN'T KNOW he didn't know. He didn't
[1:05:53] put together the church, the house, you
[1:05:55] know. And so we just started talking.
[1:05:57] And he, you know, he he starts away with
[1:05:59] his little bit of foul morning language.
[1:06:02] And I just um I don't I let people be
[1:06:04] who they are. I don't want them to put
[1:06:05] on anything for my sake. You know, a lot
[1:06:08] of times I don't tell them at all I'm a
[1:06:09] preacher till I I wait till I've given
[1:06:11] them enough rope and then I Oh, by the
[1:06:14] way, what do you do? Well,
[1:06:19] I'm a salesman.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; I sell life assurance.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; Can we talk about a policy?
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; Well, he figured out who I was. But
[1:06:32] before he did that, before he figured
[1:06:34] out that I was the pastor, cuz I
[1:06:35] eventually finally told him, he started
[1:06:37] talking about, "Oh man, this arthritis,
[1:06:39] boy, it gets me. Oh my goodness, when I
[1:06:41] try to get up in the morning, man, I'm
[1:06:42] so stiff. I can't hardly move." He said,
[1:06:44] "I'm hurting so bad right now." And I
[1:06:46] was like, "Is that right?" And you know,
[1:06:49] I And so I just I'm still thinking about
[1:06:51] let's get my building around here. It's
[1:06:53] dark. It's cold. Let's get this over
[1:06:54] with. And I'm walking away and all of a
[1:06:56] sudden somebody's tapping me on the
[1:06:58] shoulder and it's the Holy Spirit
[1:06:59] saying, "What are you going to do about
[1:07:00] that?
[1:07:01] I was like, "Do about what?" Said, "This
[1:07:04] man said he has arthritis and he's
[1:07:06] suffering. Do you think it's some
[1:07:07] accident that out of seven and a half
[1:07:09] billion people in the earth, I sent him
[1:07:11] to you?"
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; And and and he wasn't even when you
[1:07:14] bought the building, you've never seen
[1:07:15] him. This guy has brought him as a
[1:07:16] helper. And you think that's an
[1:07:18] accident? I said, "Okay, Lord, let's
[1:07:20] turn around. Let's go back." And so I
[1:07:23] waited for all the business to get done.
[1:07:24] And I didn't want to interrupt that. But
[1:07:27] uh I finally, you know, I just um and
[1:07:29] then he started talking about I said,
[1:07:31] "Well," I said, "The Lord can heal
[1:07:33] that." And he goes, "Oh, I know that's
[1:07:35] true." And then the then the other guy,
[1:07:37] then he gets religious and oh, have you
[1:07:39] heard about that holy water out in
[1:07:41] Blackwell? I'm like, "The what?" He
[1:07:43] goes, "Yeah, people people come from
[1:07:46] miles and get healed." And I said, "Is
[1:07:48] that right?" And so, and I'm thinking,
[1:07:51] Lord, what in the world? And so I
[1:07:53] thought, WELL, NOW I CAN'T LET THIS GO.
[1:07:55] I'M GOING TO HAVE to correct that error.
[1:07:57] And it's NOT A IT'S NOT A GRIEVOUS
[1:07:59] ERROR. They're very sincere in it and
[1:08:01] they're very grateful. They're not
[1:08:04] criticizing. They're actually saying,
[1:08:06] "This is wonderful." And he's telling
[1:08:07] his friend, "You should go get in that
[1:08:09] water." So I just let the whole thing go
[1:08:11] around. And finally, when it come back,
[1:08:13] I waited till everything was done. And I
[1:08:16] kne I had just given the man five grand.
[1:08:18] So I figured he'd let me have 90 seconds
[1:08:20] to witness to him. And so I I said,
[1:08:22] "Listen." And I said, "What's your
[1:08:24] name?" He said, "William." And I said,
[1:08:25] "Oh, that's a good name."
[1:08:28] Wow. And I said, "Now listen, William."
[1:08:31] And I started started giving him a
[1:08:32] testimony. I said, "Listen, William, in
[1:08:34] this little church right here, I'm the
[1:08:35] pastor." He said, "Oh, okay. Praise the
[1:08:37] Lord." And I said, and he said, "Man," I
[1:08:40] SAID, "I'M GOING TO BE IN CHURCH. I'M
[1:08:41] GONNA BE IN CHURCH SOMEWHERE TONIGHT
[1:08:43] because it's New Year's. I'm gonna be in
[1:08:44] church somewhere." I said, "Well, you
[1:08:45] you know, here you go." And uh and and
[1:08:48] and so I said, "Listen, in that little
[1:08:50] building, we we have had miracles over
[1:08:53] the years. So many miracles, cancers,
[1:08:55] and tumors vanished off of people.
[1:08:58] People have come in with failing kidneys
[1:08:59] and had them start back up. We've seen
[1:09:01] I've and I said, I have traveled around
[1:09:03] the world for years, and I've I've seen
[1:09:06] epilepsy come off of little girls. I've
[1:09:08] seen blinded eyes open on elderly
[1:09:10] ladies." I said, "So it doesn't matter
[1:09:12] your age. It doesn't matter your
[1:09:13] culture, what color you I said, "The
[1:09:15] Lord doesn't respect persons that way."
[1:09:18] And I had both of them, their undivided
[1:09:20] attention. And I said, "Listen,
[1:09:21] William." I said, "The reason that water
[1:09:25] out there in Blackwell, the reason that
[1:09:26] can work, I'm not saying it it it would.
[1:09:29] I'm saying the reason it can is because
[1:09:31] people have faith in that." See, I said,
[1:09:32] "It's not the water that heals anybody."
[1:09:34] I said, "Water doesn't even save you
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; to it certainly can't heal you." And I
[1:09:40] said, and and so I said, "The reason it
[1:09:42] does is it's faith." people put their
[1:09:45] faith in that. I said, 'Now, let me give
[1:09:46] you something better. Put your faith in
[1:09:48] the promise of God's word. And here's
[1:09:50] the promise that that day on Calvary
[1:09:53] means Jesus has already healed you." And
[1:09:56] I said, "And you got to believe that and
[1:09:59] accept it and it's yours for the taking
[1:10:00] and you put it in the past and just
[1:10:02] start thanking him for doing it and
[1:10:03] he'll let you get well." And I said, "We
[1:10:06] I'm not I'm not I'm not wasting your
[1:10:08] time." I said, "I'm 100% convinced. I'll
[1:10:10] pray for you right now and the Lord will
[1:10:12] take this arthritis away from you
[1:10:14] absolutely 100% if you'll believe it and
[1:10:17] accept it and just walk in it and it'll
[1:10:19] come to pass. Your body will obey your
[1:10:21] confession. LISTEN FRIENDS, I THEY CAN'T
[1:10:23] TELL ME. I DIDN'T BEEN AROUND THE WORLD
[1:10:24] PRAYING FOR PEOPLE. I done seen it too
[1:10:26] many times. You come too LATE TO TELL ME
[1:10:28] GOD DOESN'T JESUS SAVES. JESUS HEALS.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; It's in the same atonement. AS LONG AS
[1:10:34] I'M PREACHING SALVATION, I'LL PREACH
[1:10:36] DIVINE HEALING.
[1:10:38] And so, so I just said, "You can I pray
[1:10:41] for you?" And he said, 'Absolutely. And
[1:10:42] I prayed for him right there. And I
[1:10:44] said, 'Now you come back and you give me
[1:10:46] the testimony. I said, now it's
[1:10:47] according to your faith. But remember,
[1:10:50] and I gave him what brother Brandham
[1:10:51] said. If Jesus was standing here right
[1:10:53] now, William, and you said, Lord, would
[1:10:56] you heal me? He would say, William, I
[1:10:58] cannot heal you because I've already
[1:11:01] healed you 2,000 years ago. I said, so
[1:11:04] William, you put that in the past tense.
[1:11:06] That's Bosworth language. You put that
[1:11:08] in the past tense and you just start
[1:11:10] thanking God for it. Now that's William
[1:11:11] Brandon language. Just start thanking
[1:11:13] him. Go thanking him. You remember that
[1:11:15] time I PUT HOW MANY QUOTES UP HERE? A
[1:11:17] DOZEN or more or 20 or so where brother
[1:11:20] Brandon would just bring PEOPLE THROUGH
[1:11:21] THE PRAYER LINE AND SAY, "NOW go
[1:11:23] thanking him and you'll get well. Now
[1:11:24] just start thanking him. He'll let you
[1:11:26] get well. Now go praising him and you'll
[1:11:28] be all right." See? SO HE'S ALREADY done
[1:11:31] it.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; See? And so AND SO I AND SO I PRAYED FOR
[1:11:35] HIM and and I had always all my life. I
[1:11:38] don't know how I never thought of it in
[1:11:40] my whole life. I've played I've prayed
[1:11:42] for plenty of black people, but I it's
[1:11:45] never occurred to me. And as I'm praying
[1:11:47] for him, I could hear William Brandham
[1:11:49] in my head. And I started saying, "Lord,
[1:11:52] it was an African man, Simon ofSirene,
[1:11:55] who carried your cross." And I've got my
[1:11:58] hand on him and I said, "Now here stands
[1:12:00] one of his children." And I had always
[1:12:02] wanted to pray that prayer like that.
[1:12:04] And when I said that, you could just
[1:12:06] feel him. He just it touched him so
[1:12:08] much. Will you help me pray for THIS MAN
[1:12:10] NAMED WILLIAM? I'm just believing. I've
[1:12:12] been praying FOR HIM ALL DAY. LORD, DO
[1:12:13] IT.
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; REVEAL. Quicken it to him, Lord. Let him
[1:12:17] be healed.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness.
[1:12:21] Peter, he could duel the creed just as
[1:12:23] good as anybody could. But when it come
[1:12:26] to spiritual courage, he didn't have it.
[1:12:29] SO, HE FAILED RIGHT THERE. NOW, WHY? He
[1:12:31] only knowed one thing, his creed. But,
[1:12:34] brother, after he went up to Pentecost,
[1:12:38] he put on the whole armor of God.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; Now, watch him. He's a different person.
[1:12:43] Now, see, here's where Brother Brham
[1:12:47] turns up the volume. That brother
[1:12:49] Brandham doesn't get down into the
[1:12:50] trenches with so much like Luther and
[1:12:53] Wesley and the Zuza Revival fathers,
[1:12:55] Pink or Bosworth or even Wigglesworth.
[1:12:58] BROTHER BRANDHAM IS SAYING LOOK WHAT YOU
[1:13:00] NEED IS THE TOKEN. WHAT YOU NEED IS THE
[1:13:03] WHOLE LIFE OF CHRIST. THAT IS THE WHOLE
[1:13:05] ARMOR AND YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM.
[1:13:08] IT'S NOT ABOUT IT'S NOT A MENTAL PSYCH
[1:13:11] GAME.
[1:13:12] I'M IMAGINING A SWORD IN MY HAND. I'M
[1:13:14] IMAGINING A HELMET. I'M IMAGINING THIS.
[1:13:16] THAT'S NONSENSE. THIS isn't mental
[1:13:18] warfare. THIS IS DEMONOLOGY IN THE
[1:13:21] SPIRITUAL REALM. SEE, and I it's my
[1:13:25] relationship with Christ.
[1:13:28] See, watch him now. He's a different
[1:13:30] person now. What was it? That word that
[1:13:35] he had walked with was in him, burning
[1:13:39] him up with fire in his flesh and soul.
[1:13:42] He had the whole armor of God on. That's
[1:13:46] God's provided armor. He had the baptism
[1:13:50] filled with the Holy Ghost. What is it?
[1:13:54] Fair question. What is it? God makes
[1:13:58] himself everpresent in his own army.
[1:14:01] Aren't you glad for that? God on the day
[1:14:04] of Pentecost sent down the full armor of
[1:14:08] God for his army.
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; This is war.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; We are an army.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; We are an army. This is war. And I don't
[1:14:17] plan to lose it.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; God bless you. We're going to stop.
[1:14:26] Praise the Lord. Now,
[1:14:28] um going to stand you back to your feet
[1:14:31] at this time and we're going to ask the
[1:14:34] brothers to begin. Um I'm I'm assuming
[1:14:37] everything here is set to go. Brother
[1:14:39] Luther is always so efficient at that.
[1:14:43] We've got a number of families uh that
[1:14:45] are out sick. We had some Sunday who are
[1:14:48] back with us tonight and then some other
[1:14:49] ones that were here and and couldn't be
[1:14:52] tonight. I got a report from Brother
[1:14:54] Jack. He's with Sister Kathy and uh and
[1:14:58] they'll be doing the communion as we
[1:14:59] are. Uh they're streaming live. Uh
[1:15:01] brother Bruce and Sister Linda also sent
[1:15:04] to me that as we're taking communion,
[1:15:05] they'll be serving each other communion.
[1:15:07] So, it's a wonderful thing to see our
[1:15:10] friends who can't be with us here
[1:15:12] tonight. Brother Tony and his whole
[1:15:13] family have been sick. So, uh uh so, so
[1:15:16] we want to keep them in prayer tonight.
[1:15:18] Brother Jack said, "Sister Kathy, her
[1:15:20] bleeding has stopped. She's got a little
[1:15:22] bit of discharge, but other than that,
[1:15:24] she's doing much better. And he's just
[1:15:26] believing God is going to completely
[1:15:28] heal her. And I say amen to that. Amen.
[1:15:31] We sure miss Brother Jack and Sister
[1:15:33] Kathy. Amen. Praise the Lord. Um I want
[1:15:38] to um to read from
[1:15:42] um 1 Corinthians chapter 11. Um
[1:15:48] let's uh let's see. Um,
[1:15:52] Deb, what where you at, sister? Um, uh,
[1:15:56] yeah, go relieve her, Josie. And Deb,
[1:15:59] come in to the piano just for a minute.
[1:16:01] I know I'm uh running this out of sync
[1:16:03] just a wee bit from what brother Matt
[1:16:05] has set up, but if you'll just uh give
[1:16:07] me some soft piano. I want to read these
[1:16:09] scriptures as we begin to kind of change
[1:16:12] the atmosphere from um from ministering
[1:16:16] to the distribution of these these
[1:16:20] sacred articles
[1:16:23] in 1 Corinthians
[1:16:25] chap 11
[1:16:28] just something softly as you choose
[1:16:31] sister Deb
[1:16:34] verse 23
[1:16:37] for I have received of the Lord that
[1:16:41] which also I delivered unto you that the
[1:16:44] Lord Jesus the same night in which he
[1:16:47] was betrayed took bread
[1:16:51] and when he had given thanks he broke it
[1:16:54] and said take eat this is my body thank
[1:16:57] you brother Luther which is broken for
[1:17:00] you this do in remembrance of me
[1:17:06] after the same manner He also he manner
[1:17:10] also he took the cup when he had sucked
[1:17:13] saying this cup is the new testament in
[1:17:17] my blood. This do ye as oft as you drink
[1:17:21] it in remembrance of me. For as often as
[1:17:25] you eat this bread and drink this cup
[1:17:28] you do show the Lord's death till he
[1:17:30] come. Wherefore whosoever shall eat this
[1:17:34] bread and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:17:37] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[1:17:40] and blood of the Lord.
[1:17:42] Now that's whenever I read that that has
[1:17:46] such an ominous sound. But I want you to
[1:17:49] notice the next word. But let a man
[1:17:51] examine himself and so let him eat of
[1:17:55] that bread and drink of that cup. So the
[1:17:58] verses prior to that are not a
[1:18:01] prohibition. Say, "I don't feel worthy."
[1:18:04] Get get worthy.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; Repent. Give your heart to the Lord.
[1:18:09] See, set yourself set your heart right
[1:18:11] now. Examine your life. You just heard
[1:18:14] enough preaching. You should have been
[1:18:16] examining your life already. See, but
[1:18:18] let a man examine himself. And so let
[1:18:21] him eat of that bread and drink of that
[1:18:24] cup. For he that eateth and drinkkeeth
[1:18:27] unworthily eateth and drinkkeeth
[1:18:29] damnation to himself. You know, you a
[1:18:32] secret sinner, and you got things that
[1:18:34] aren't under the blood. That's unworthy.
[1:18:36] See, you eat and drink damnation to
[1:18:38] himself, not discerning the Lord's body.
[1:18:41] For this cause, many are weak and sickly
[1:18:43] among you, and many sleep. For if we
[1:18:46] would judge ourselves, we should not be
[1:18:49] judged. But when we are judged, we are
[1:18:52] chasened of the Lord, that we should not
[1:18:55] be condemned with the world. That is so
[1:19:00] comforting to me to know that I am
[1:19:03] partaking of of sacraments that that
[1:19:06] that that speak to the fact that I am
[1:19:09] trusting Christ
[1:19:12] for my entire life. I have committed my
[1:19:15] soul. The most valuable thing you have
[1:19:19] is your soul.
[1:19:21] And I've committed that to the word of
[1:19:24] this hour. Let's bow our heads
[1:19:28] in prayer. Master,
[1:19:32] we come now to this sacred moment of
[1:19:35] partaking of the bread and the wine. And
[1:19:39] we settle ourselves, Lord, in our hearts
[1:19:41] and minds. and I
[1:19:44] slow my own pace down and settle my own
[1:19:47] spirit down now, Lord, to this solemn
[1:19:49] moment. We thank you for the word and
[1:19:51] the inspiration that we felt. Thank you
[1:19:55] for what it means to us, Lord. I've
[1:19:57] pondered those statements long, and I I
[1:20:00] have said to you, and so say I again,
[1:20:03] Lord, I want my whole life. Lord, let it
[1:20:05] be that tonight could be a complete
[1:20:09] renewal for anyone who needs it. Father,
[1:20:11] I I rededicate my whole life to you. I'm
[1:20:14] sorry for all the mistakes I've made in
[1:20:17] this past year of 2025. I'm sorry for
[1:20:20] that, Lord. I'm sorry for all the times
[1:20:22] that either I didn't follow your
[1:20:25] leadership when I should have or maybe I
[1:20:28] act presumptuously when I shouldn't have
[1:20:30] or did that which wasn't pleasing,
[1:20:32] grieved your spirit. Lord, may you
[1:20:35] forgive me. You know, it wouldn't be in
[1:20:36] our hearts to be that way. Lord, this
[1:20:39] world is a dark place. This flesh, Lord,
[1:20:42] in an unredeemed condition with
[1:20:44] everything that that feeds it from the
[1:20:47] world. We can hardly escape it, Lord. No
[1:20:49] matter where we go, the pollution, the
[1:20:51] pollution of sin, it it pervades
[1:20:54] everything, Lord, that we function in
[1:20:56] and about with just everyday life, Lord.
[1:20:59] We don't go looking for it. It finds us
[1:21:02] everywhere we go. But Father, I pray for
[1:21:05] fresh cleansing tonight of all hearts,
[1:21:08] minds. May every person, Lord, here in
[1:21:11] this building and out abroad and those
[1:21:13] who are taking the Lord's supper with us
[1:21:15] at this time, I pray this prayer for us
[1:21:17] all. Lord, as Job prayed, per adventure,
[1:21:20] one of his family members had sinned. He
[1:21:22] offered sacrifice for them. I pray for
[1:21:25] my whole church assembly and all those
[1:21:27] that you have placed under my care.
[1:21:29] Lord, we commit it to you now in the
[1:21:32] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Now,
[1:21:35] we're going to allow our musicians to
[1:21:37] come first. Uh they will replace Sister
[1:21:40] Deborah, if you want to come down and
[1:21:42] let's have the musicians and their
[1:21:44] families um come first so that they can
[1:21:47] take the platform and then we're going
[1:21:48] to have some song specials when the
[1:21:51] during the remainder of it. Amen. Amen.
[1:21:53] Let's have our musicians come with their
[1:21:55] families at this time. Uh straight
[1:21:57] straight go around this way and come
[1:21:59] straight in like this. Amen.
[1:22:02] Deb, you can join your family when they
[1:22:03] when they get up here.
[1:22:06] Come prayerfully.
[1:23:42] Okay.
[1:23:46] Okay.
[1:24:11] Baby,
[1:24:34] Amen.
[1:24:37] We're going to have our musicians
[1:24:39] playing and singing for us. We're going
[1:24:41] to take this side first. Just let you
[1:24:43] come. Those who haven't yet taken it
[1:24:45] past before at this time, come ahead.
[1:25:23] for what you
[1:25:27] are doing
[1:25:32] it me
[1:25:36] all though I
[1:25:41] am not yet
[1:25:45] what I need
[1:25:49] to be
[1:25:54] for in my
[1:25:58] I often find
[1:26:02] there's too much
[1:26:05] of me.
[1:26:07] I pray you take it away
[1:26:13] and then you'd stay
[1:26:17] where I used
[1:26:20] to be.
[1:26:24] I love you
[1:26:28] for what you
[1:26:32] are doing
[1:26:37] in me.
[1:26:41] Although I
[1:26:45] am not yet.
[1:26:50] All this middle can begin to come in
[1:26:52] line. One in the middle.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; I often find
[1:27:06] there's too much
[1:27:09] of me.
[1:27:11] I pray you take it away
[1:27:17] and then you'd stay.
[1:27:20] where I used
[1:27:24] to be.
[1:27:27] I fallen
[1:27:31] so far
[1:27:35] that I've broken my
[1:27:39] own heart again.
[1:27:44] what you've seen,
[1:27:48] the things I've done
[1:27:53] and what I have
[1:27:56] become.
[1:28:00] But you're the one
[1:28:03] who made me out of dust.
[1:28:09] So make me one more time.
[1:28:14] And when you look at me,
[1:28:19] I want to be
[1:28:24] what you had in mind.
[1:28:31] I love you
[1:28:35] for what you
[1:28:40] are doing.
[1:28:44] in me.
[1:28:48] Alough I
[1:28:52] am not yet
[1:28:56] what I need
[1:29:00] to be.
[1:29:05] In my mind
[1:29:08] I often find
[1:29:12] there's too much
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; all the rest of the people can come
[1:29:20] through that
[1:29:22] And then you'd stay
[1:29:26] where I used
[1:29:30] to be.
[1:30:00] through prophets old.
[1:30:05] Your word was spoken.
[1:30:11] Now on the page
[1:30:17] I can read
[1:30:22] how you came down.
[1:30:27] Your body broken
[1:30:33] and now your spirit
[1:30:38] can dwell in me.
[1:30:44] Dwell in me.
[1:30:49] Dwell in me.
[1:30:55] So the world
[1:31:00] your life may see
[1:31:06] and in your presence
[1:31:12] I can be
[1:31:14] constantly
[1:31:17] if your spirit
[1:31:22] would dwell in me.
[1:31:28] Oh, the love Lord
[1:31:33] that you have shown me.
[1:31:39] Oh, the grace
[1:31:44] that sets me free
[1:31:50] in my heart, Lord.
[1:31:55] May your home be.
[1:32:00] Oh, let your spirit
[1:32:06] come dwell in me.
[1:32:12] Dwell in me.
[1:32:17] Dwell in me.
[1:32:23] So the world
[1:32:28] your life may see
[1:32:33] and in your presence
[1:32:39] I can be
[1:32:42] constantly
[1:32:45] if your spirit Spirit
[1:32:50] would dwell in me. Sing it again,
[1:32:53] brother Steve.
[1:32:55] Oh, dwell in me.
[1:32:58] Stand back.
[1:33:01] Dwell in me.
[1:33:07] Oh, the world
[1:33:12] your life may see.
[1:33:17] And in your presence
[1:33:23] I can be
[1:33:26] constantly
[1:33:28] if your spirit
[1:33:33] would dwell in me.
[1:33:39] Let your spirit
[1:33:44] come dwell in me,
[1:33:49] Lord. Let your spirit
[1:33:55] come dwell
[1:33:57] in me.
[1:34:04] Amen. Amen.
[1:34:06] We're going to read from John chapter
[1:34:08] 13. And um I don't know how many songs
[1:34:11] they had lined up. We might have a few
[1:34:12] we can get to when we come back in.
[1:34:14] We'll see.
[1:34:16] St. John 13
[1:34:19] verse one.
[1:34:22] Now before the feast of the Passover,
[1:34:26] when Jesus knew that his hour was come
[1:34:28] that he should depart out of this world
[1:34:31] unto the Father, having loved his own
[1:34:35] which were in the world, he loved them
[1:34:38] unto the end.
[1:34:40] and supper being ended, the devil having
[1:34:43] now put into the heart of Judas
[1:34:45] Escariat, Simon's son, to betray him.
[1:34:49] Jesus knowing that the Father had given
[1:34:51] all things into his hands, and that he
[1:34:54] was come from God, and went to God, he
[1:34:57] riseth from supper, and laid aside his
[1:35:00] garments, and took a towel, and girded
[1:35:02] himself. After that he pth water into a
[1:35:05] basin and began to wash the disciples
[1:35:08] feet and to wipe them with the towel
[1:35:10] wherewith he was girded.
[1:35:13] Then cometh he to Simon Peter. Peter
[1:35:16] saith unto him, Lord, dust thou wash my
[1:35:19] feet? Jesus answered and said unto him,
[1:35:22] What do thou knowest not now, but thou
[1:35:27] shalt know hereafter?
[1:35:29] Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never
[1:35:31] wash my feet. Jesus answered him, "If I
[1:35:35] wash thee not, thou hast no part with
[1:35:37] me." Simon Peter saith unto him,"Lord,
[1:35:40] not my feet only, but also my hands and
[1:35:43] my head." Jesus saith to him, "He that
[1:35:46] is washed needeth not, saved to wash his
[1:35:48] feet, but is clean every wit. And you're
[1:35:51] clean, but not all. For he knew who
[1:35:54] should betray him. Therefore said he,
[1:35:56] you're not all clean."
[1:35:58] So after he had washed their feet and
[1:36:00] had taken his garments and sat down
[1:36:02] again, he said unto them, "Know ye what
[1:36:06] I have done to you? You call me Master
[1:36:09] and Lord, and you say well, for so I am.
[1:36:12] If I then, your Lord and Master, have
[1:36:15] washed your feet, you also ought to wash
[1:36:18] one another's feet. For I have given you
[1:36:21] an example that ye should do as I have
[1:36:23] done to you." Verily, verily, truly,
[1:36:27] truly, I say unto you, the servant is
[1:36:30] not greater than his Lord, neither he
[1:36:33] that is sent greater than he that sent
[1:36:35] him. If you know these things, happy are
[1:36:38] ye if you do them. Amen. At this time,
[1:36:42] the brothers will be dismissed to the
[1:36:44] fellowship. Paul, the sisters will
[1:36:45] remain inside, and we will reassemble
[1:36:48] shortly. God bless you.
[1:42:45] Heat. Heat.
[1:43:27] Hey,
[1:43:34] hey, hey.
[2:09:59] Oh,
[2:10:15] well.
[2:10:42] There's a land that is fairer
[2:10:47] than day.
[2:10:50] And by faith we can see it afar.
[2:10:59] For the Father
[2:11:02] waits over
[2:11:04] the way
[2:11:08] to prepare
[2:11:10] us a dwelling
[2:11:12] place there
[2:11:16] in the sweet
[2:11:21] by and by
[2:11:25] we shall meet on and a beautiful
[2:11:30] shore
[2:11:34] in the sweet
[2:11:39] by and by
[2:11:43] we shall meet on that beautiful
[2:11:48] shore.
[2:11:51] Oh, we shall sing on that beautiful
[2:11:57] shore.
[2:12:01] The melodious
[2:12:03] songs
[2:12:05] of the blessed
[2:12:09] and our spirit
[2:12:12] shall sorrow
[2:12:15] no more.
[2:12:18] Oh
[2:12:20] for the blessing
[2:12:23] of rest
[2:12:27] in the sea
[2:12:32] by
[2:12:36] we shall be on the beautiful
[2:12:41] shore.
[2:12:44] Oh, in the sea
[2:12:49] by and by
[2:12:53] we shall meet on that
[2:12:59] in the street. One more time in the
[2:13:01] swing. Now in the free
[2:13:12] Now we
[2:13:16] shall
[2:13:30] be on that beautiful
[2:13:34] show.
[2:13:37] Give the Lord a hand.
[2:13:44] Amen. I'm going to ask brother Matt to
[2:13:46] come and close us out in prayer and give
[2:13:47] us a congregational song to leave with.
[2:13:51] Uh before we go, I just want you to all
[2:13:54] um realize that tonight uh this is
[2:13:57] brother Muna's last service with us.
[2:13:59] He's his assignment uh in Georgia with
[2:14:02] the military. He's headed back to
[2:14:04] Washington DC area. Back up there with
[2:14:06] brother Mike Walls the Saints there.
[2:14:08] We've sure enjoyed having him here among
[2:14:11] us. Amen. Wonderful.
[2:14:14] Amen.
[2:14:16] And um maybe the Lord will let him come
[2:14:18] back and visit us real soon. Amen.
[2:14:20] Praise the Lord. He said, "I need to
[2:14:22] come up that way." Well, that can be
[2:14:23] arranged to talk to uh your pastor if
[2:14:25] there's a good friend of mine. Amen.
[2:14:27] Praise the Lord. Amen. God bless you.
[2:14:29] Thank you for coming tonight. God bless
[2:14:31] you. Listen friends, it's uh you know,
[2:14:33] brother Brandham when he comes, I think
[2:14:35] it's um I want to say it's his New
[2:14:37] Year's service in ' 64, might stand
[2:14:40] correction. I believe that's when it
[2:14:41] was. And he starts talking about um or
[2:14:44] at least right near the end of the year.
[2:14:46] And he says, you know, it's a it's a
[2:14:50] it's a sad time and a dark time for the
[2:14:52] world, but it's a glorious time for the
[2:14:56] bride of Christ. And I just say we need
[2:14:58] to find, you know, I I I've said that
[2:15:01] that the Lord, you know, he's so
[2:15:04] merciful. He He's never going to send
[2:15:06] anyone to hell who doesn't want to go
[2:15:08] there. Now, that sounds like a pretty
[2:15:10] broad statement. You say, "Well,
[2:15:12] nobody's going to want to go there." But
[2:15:14] the but you know, when it comes right
[2:15:15] down to it is, you know, do you really
[2:15:20] love the life of Jesus Christ? Because
[2:15:25] if you don't love the life of Jesus
[2:15:27] Christ, for sure you don't want to be in
[2:15:29] heaven. Because all of heaven is filled
[2:15:33] with his life. And so people might think
[2:15:36] they want to go to some fairy tale. They
[2:15:38] think of heaven, but I want to go where
[2:15:40] the Lord's life is.
[2:15:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Right here on earth for a thousand
[2:15:44] years and then a new heaven and a new
[2:15:46] earth. So I just say that we go out and
[2:15:49] try to persuade everyone correctly who
[2:15:52] Jesus is. And just tell them he is his
[2:15:55] word.
[2:15:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the best thing you can tell
[2:15:58] them. Christ is his word. Forget what
[2:16:01] anybody's told you about him. He is his
[2:16:03] word. You find his word, you'll find
[2:16:06] him. You find him, you'll find his word.
[2:16:08] Amen. They're one and the same. They
[2:16:10] cannot be separated. Turn around and
[2:16:12] shake hands with somebody. God bless you
[2:16:14] and we'll see y'all next year. Amen. The
[2:16:17] Lord willing uh on Sunday. Amen. Brother
[2:16:20] Mer.
[2:16:26] &gt;&gt; May the Lord bless you. You can be
[2:16:28] dismissed. God bless you.
[2:16:32] Jesus
[2:16:34] is my plea.
[2:16:41] really walking close to thee.
[2:16:48] Let it be,
[2:16:51] dear Lord.
[2:16:53] Let it be.
[2:16:59] I
[2:17:01] am weak, but thou art strong.
[2:17:08] Jesus,
[2:17:22] as long
[2:17:26] as I walk,
[2:17:29] let me walk close to thee.
[2:17:36] Oh, just
[2:17:39] a closer walk with thee.
[2:17:46] Granted,
[2:17:49] Jesus, that's my plea.
[2:17:55] Oh, dearly
[2:17:58] walking close to thee.
[2:18:05] Let it be,
[2:18:07] dear Lord.
[2:18:09] Let it be
[2:18:15] through
[2:18:17] this world of toils and sn.
[2:18:24] Oh,
[2:18:27] I falter, Lord, who cares?
[2:18:33] Oh, who
[2:18:36] with me? My burden share.
[2:18:43] None but thee,
[2:18:46] dear Lord.
[2:18:48] None but thee.
[2:18:53] Oh, just
[2:18:55] a closer walk with thee.
[2:19:03] Oh, granted
[2:19:06] Jesus, it's my plea.
[2:19:15] Walking close to thee,
[2:19:20] oh,
[2:19:22] let it be,
[2:19:24] dear Lord.
[2:19:26] Let it be.
[2:19:32] When
[2:19:34] my fearful life is over,
[2:19:41] all time
[2:19:43] for me will be no more.
[2:19:50] But God
[2:19:53] be gently.
