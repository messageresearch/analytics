the Believers there and all the different ones we just waiting for the coming of the Lord this this might not go well amen so if you have your Bibles this evening I invite you to the scripture amen we'll let you be seated I was studying in the scripture the other day and I just uh came across this little that may come in real Handy by the way and uh uh I was anybody that knows me I I I like words I I like uh I like to know the meaning of sometimes the root of a word it has value and uh so I came across this place in the scripture in the book of Titus you turn there with me Amen brother Demars good to see you buddy man we pray for brother Jason he's out in the field and and we he's our lifeline and our our our our main line to the to the Middle East and so we appreciate man all that he does and I came across this place in the book of Titus and I thought that you know Titus being uh bit of a an odd an odd name and I said what does what does Titus mean what does the name Titus mean you know I know what my name means and other names and I looked it up and uh you're going to be surprised and but I'll wait before I tell youen so but we want to begin reading in the book of Titus there H at verse one 1 one Titus Chapter 1 verse one it says Paul a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ according to the faith of God's elect don't you like that amen that's that's my kind of Faith the faith of God's elect and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness in Hope of eternal life which God that cannot lie promised before the world began when that's a that's a that's a that's way back there but hath in due times manifested his word through preaching which is committed unto me according to the Commandment of God our savior my I came with some Authority there I would say to Titus my own son after the common Faith grace mercy and peace from God the father and the Lord Jesus Christ Our Savior let us pray together Heavenly Father we just come this evening as Believers and as uh that elect that your Bible spoke of Lord we pray that you would come this evening in your August presence Lord walk in among us as you have so many times and walk among the AES Lord meet the needs of your children Lord for truly we're a needy people we ask you father that if we have done anything that would displease you in any way Lord we realize there is still a blood band around this Earth that we can Lord that is a is a bumper your Prophet said between your judgment and Lord we pray father that you would forgive us Lord Lord of our shortcomings and of our many faults and failures and that Lord that we could come Justified into your presence Lord even as Aaron able to walk in behind the veil into that shikina glory Lord where things lived we pray that you would make us live this evening in your presence Lord as we are very Mindful and very careful to give you all the thanks and Praise Jesus name we would ask it the church said God bless you have your seats this evening just kind of I want to run around and hug everybody's neck but we'll wait till after church for all those things but the most important thing that we can do this evening is to receive the engrafted word of God into our souls and uh we just believe that God has maybe just a little something for us as uh we get started uh where um so first of all we have here the Apostle Paul as our first age messenger and as in his office he was the he he broke the from the Old Testament and brought us into the modern era the Christian era and in doing so he brought a word that would then as we know from the church age book set the precedent for all other ages and that we would be able to use the message of the Apostle as the as the The Matrix for all other Messengers unto our time and so that even we ourselves would then be able to uh know if our gospel was correct or that if our uh if we were in line with the mind of God because we know that the Bible the word of God is God's mind it's the and so as we want to make sure that everything that we do is supported by the the the truth of God's word so so we find here that Paul then sets his uh criteria or his qualifications and credentials here in this first three verses he tells how that he was an apostle and that it was according to the faith of God's elect it was based upon the hope of eternal life amen which uh from God who cannot lie and that it was given unto him amen by the Commandment of God and now he's going to address this uh uh these criteria or these these credentials and he's going to now hand this over to a five-fold minister all right to the apost to to to Titus now Titus here uh we'll find a little bit later uh what his what the what the purpose was for Titus but we we find here that he says to Titus mine own son after the common faith and so here was this this this individual that we uh we want to look at this evening just for a a moment because there's some things here that need to be established now to Titus we realize that uh he was going to I want to go on down here and read just for a second here in verse 5 he said for this cause left I Thee Inc that thou shouldest preach my church order book that you're going to take the church order message the conduct order and Doctrine and you're going to teach it to these uh people that are in cre to set things in order the things which are uh uh are wanting and uh ordain Elders in every city as I have appointed thee so now then here was going to be Titus he was going he was under the uh the jurisdiction and the instruction of the first church age messenger and he was going to come in and he was going to preach he was going to teach he was going to set in order he was going to do these things to the local uh areas wherever he was going to be sent in the local area of cre now the name Titus is uh is interesting because it's going to to identify each and every one of us together amen and because the name Titus simply means a Christian all right the Lord it means uh it's a title of Honor that's what it means it's no there's no uh uh there's no real deep mystery here it just means it just means a Christian you can look it up in your strong concordance and it will tell you that Titus means a Christian amen and uh that's what its definition is it also refers to a or a title of honor and so the name Christian becomes this title of Honor that we each and everyone can attach to our own self so it would be uh uh uh Tito which was the the the the Roman or the Greek uh derivative of it and then it had he would have maybe two or three other names behind that that was the Roman custom of that time so uh uh we would be uh titos Dale Smith or put your name there however you would want to do it means Christian it means somebody uh a title of honor the Bible tells us over in the book of Acts chapter 11 that the disciples were uh called Christians first in Antioch so here was this this title that was given now we realize then that that title by the uh by the uh antiochian uh that they that was actually a like what brother brandom said that the devil hung a name on the Christian today called him Holy Roller he said that's a that's a de that's a title that the devil hung on Believers and so this this uh this name uh uh Christos or uh christianos or Christians as we would call it that it was actually a slang name that was just thrown out there to like herodian or uh uh you know any uh uh the the aristocrates or the different ones that it was just a name that was just thrown out there uh because of their association with uh with the one that was called Christ now from McLaren's expositions I want to read this little commentary is quite interesting to me it says that uh the speaking of the Christians he says there success of their work in Antioch amongst the pure Heathen population has for its crowning uh attestation is this that it compelled the Curiosity hunting pleasure loving sarcastic antiochian to find a new name for this new thing to write out a label for the new bottles and to which the new wine was being put in clearly the name shows that the church was beginning to attract the attention of Outsiders and so we realized then so they just had to throw a name out there because they couldn't call them Jews they couldn't call them Greeks they couldn't call them Romans they had to come up with some kind of a name because they didn't fit any of the molds that was uh that was out there for the time and so they called them Christians now we had a messenger come in our day that tells us that Christian means Christlike in other words they had been in the in the uh uh in the near proximity uh to to Christ they had they they they even they told said that of Peter that we they they realized that because he was ignorant and unlearned but that he had been around this one Jesus of Nazareth because the the the scripture tells us that his speech had betrayed him and so as we look at this uh uh this this Christian this this Titus that Paul then tells him here uh we we want to come down to chapter two that when we come to chapter 2 now we could spend a lot of time on chapter one because he's dealing with ministers he said now then tell Titus he said now then Titus I want you to go and ordain Elders I want you to teach them things I want you to tell them that they have to be the husband of one wife that they have to have be blameless that they have to have you know all these criteria that this is what's going to be the credentials of any uh uh of any uh Elder that you're going to ordained and we could spend a lot of time preaching on you on the preachers tonight we've got a few of them and it would be good for us to probably spend some time lining their wheels up but we we'll leave that up to brother Jason and so uh uh but then we come down here into chapter 2 and verse one and it says speak thou the things which become sound Doctrine now you will find that here in the first two chapters uh that the that Paul uses this language of soundness and that's kind of where I want to kind of Labor uh for a good while here this evening and we'll we'll let you out uh before very long we won't keep you real late you know so I didn't put time on that and I said for uh uh I told that to brother Homer long gory one time he said You Preach as long as you want to we go home at 9ine and so so we uh so so might be here by myself you never know and so uh so he says here uh at different places like in in uh in verse n he talks about uh uh sound Doctrine uh he also goes down in verse 13 and talks about sound in faith and and and in in in chap in chapter 2 verse two he says uh repeats that sound Faith verse 8 uh sound speech so this this language of soundness this this sound uh Doctrine is the doctrine or the the admonition that Paul gave to the Christian and and so I believe that that being the the the order of all ages to follow that that we have been also instructed by the scripture by the message of the hour we could use maybe different langu language but we would we would have to come back to this that it would be uh that that the things that we believe the things that we say the things that we uh that we believe must come from sound teaching Doctrine means teaching the word there that is used in the Greek text is uh hayano uh and also it comes back to I think the actual word of soundness there is hugoh or Hugo and so uh the word there is where we get our word of hygiene all right so sound Doctrine uh equates to h a hygienic or a a a sterile not sterile but like clean like like uh like uh uh prot protected and so here it is Hyo the root of the English word hygiene it literally means when we speak of the word sound Doctrine properly in good working order all right all right so he says you're going to teach these people a doctrine that works hello you're going to teach these people a a a a a do a faith a speech that has a that functions that literally will get the job done all right that will that will bring out the um uh the the the the intended purpose yes Hallelujah not just to scratch the ears not just to entice with men's teachings but that will literally will go down into the soul and begin to convict and begin to stir somebody to live a clean life because it's hygienic it's going to it's it's going to it's going to clean you up hallelujah oh my I I I I I I saw that word that it meant uh uh meant it was uh hooy or Huggy I thought well that's like diapers them Huggy diapers that's hygienic Hallelujah so maybe we need some uh you know some some some some of that to you know keep us clean I just thought I'd throw that out there now now so it's a uh it it means in good working order hence healthy amen sound Doctrine is healthy Doctrine it's going to keep you clean it means in sound condition or balance you know you think about you know it's not brother m talked about uh uh the uh the you know the medicine he said it's got a certain amount of poison to kill the germ but then it's you know he said but can't have too much it's got to have some medicine it's got to have some poison what it's got to have a balance to it oh my let me say let me tell you something the the the the word of God in its correct dosage it will it will it will cure what ills you Hallelujah and it will clean you up praise be to God it means to be free from debilitation or handicap or incapacity oh my we're talking about a Doctrine a a a a a a sound speech and sound teaching that it it functions holistically all right hallelujah it's not something that was concocted out of some pharmaceutical laboratory but this is something that's that's going to be uh uh holistic it's going to be uh uh uh uh some of those uh some of those essential oils Hallelujah my this is this is the kind of message that we need something that's going to actually uh have remediation it's going to it's going to treat what's wrong with you in a way that will get the right kind of results and not have all kinds of perverted side effects and denominational vulture ideas hallelujah oh my uh and I really like this that it's that it's functioning holistically with all parts working together my you think about that that it's not it's not just one running off this way and one running off that way but it's Synergy it's something that's working together to produce the desired effects and so we we we we come to the message of the hour and you're going to say my brother Dale you just went shallow you went your wagon's full or wagons empty tonight well that's all right I just believe in a simple gospel I believe in something that you can take home with you something that you can put on Amen in the morning when you go to work yes sir Amen brother Bram says here give me your undivided attention for just a few minutes I I like that kind of attention it's undivided when you get some people their attentions you know they're add at church you know they're thinking about this and that and they're going every direction no no just give me your undivided attention for the next little bit here uh for a few moments these are the some of these bullet points are direct in line with each other some of them I took out out of different sermons but here we got oh I don't know there's four seven in a row that brother brandom just just just fires them off one right after the other and he starts here I believe and so when we're talking about sound Doctrine and we we we find here that Paul was given these instructions to give to Timothy he used some of the same language to Timothy he uses some of the same Lang to language to Titus uh and and so here we we find that this that that he said this was given to me by God this is information this is this is the instructions the teachings that I was given by God hallelujah and so then we come down Seven Ages later we find that Paul being a prophet we find that William Brandon was a prophet the prophet walks out he begins to give us the things that he believed and I believe that's sound I believe that works how do I know it works because dead people came out Rose to their feet cancers fell off of people eyes came into their sockets and then he could pray what color they wanted the deaf here the lame walked amen arms and and and and things began to uh uh stretch forth in the name of the Holy son Jesus and brother bradam said give me your underd divided attention for a few minutes he said I believe in the resurrection I believe in it now then we're going to clarify I believe in a spiritual Resurrection I believe that you and I are walking in resurrection power my Bible says that if the same spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you it will Quicken your mortal I'm talking about your living your the body that you're living in right now it will Quicken it to the same resurrection power that was in Jesus Christ Hallelujah brother I believe in the resurrection I believe in the bodily physical Resurrection am so he makes a distinction I believe in a supernatural resurrection of the soul and of the spirit man that'll make you walk in the in the in the power and to be called a Son of God that you can whether you uh uh experience a a body change or if you go by way of the Grave is a irrelevant Hallelujah that you can live in Resurrection he called it quickening power he called it many other things he said but I believe in the bodily physical Resurrection I'm not spiritualizing these things to the point that we can't look forward to a uh to a body change that we can't look forward to a to a time when we'll see our loved ones a walking Among Us I believe there's going to come a time amen we're going to feel a sweeping and and young men are going to become old uh older uh mature men and women and old men and old women are going to experience youngness again I believe we're going to be all about the same age and the same strength and the perfect and figure of Health I believe in a physical Resurrection where we'll see our loved ones come Among Us he says I believe in the physical bodily return of Jesus Christ well I believe in a in a in a word return as well I believe he's appeared Among Us I believe that the the person of Christ has come in 1963 on Sunset mountain and revealed to a Vindicated Prophet amen the message that would Quicken our mortal bodies I believe I believe in a supernatural uh coming of Christ in a word form but I also so believe that that same Jesus that they saw go away in that day I say why stand you there gazing for this same Jesus shall return Amen in a physical bodily return and we'll meet him in the air I believe that and brother says the church is a holy ghost filled church I believe that I believe if you're not filled with the Holy Ghost you'll split hell wide open I believe you'll miss a Rapture you'll go into Great Tribulation and I don't know what to tell you after that but I can tell you on this side you need the Holy Ghost I believe that the Church of the Living God is a holy ghost filled church amen with the power of God dwelling in her oh my I know you was waiting on this quote but brother and this is all in one one quote he said all these I believe I believe I believe the church is a holy ghost filled church that preaches Holiness to the very extremes don't you think so amen I believe in Holiness to the extremes I believe that that that that men Walk and Walk Right talk right and spit white yeah I I believe that I believe that women amen look like women act like women dress like women amen they don't wear a prostitute's uniform they wear a holy ghost uniform Hallelujah they live amen A Life That's worthy of the Gospel I believe preachers have to meet the qualifications amen that's laid down in the scriptures I believe that deacons have to live a life that's worthy of the Gospel Hallelujah we believe in Holiness to the extremes and we're not talking about dishrag Holiness huh we're not talking about you know wish bone Holiness but real Holiness amen I like this this is from faith that was once delivered to the Saints brother Bram says we believe in the phenomenal Hallelujah I believe in phenomenal Christians well you say what does phenomenal really mean well a phenomenal according to the uh uh the I think it's called a thesaurus it the the phenomenal applies to what is known or perceived through the senses rather than by Intuition or R rational deduction there's a lot of people that can rationalize or uh uh uh by intuition uh think about things uh of the church but I'm here to tell you this evening that this gospel it works in every way every part of it works brother man says it has the same Sensations it has the same experiences it has the same Supernatural if it doesn't it's a seed of discrepancy so now then I believe in a phenomenal gospel I believe in a gospel that works it ties what we used to say Amen in the old farming Community it's tying every bundle that old Baylor just kicking them out one right after the it's not it's hitting on all 18 Cinders amen it's working perfectly everything in conjunction Holiness is working with the baptism of the Holy Ghost you got the the the the pneumatics are working right along with the with the word the mechanics and the Dynamics are all working together to produce a desired effect and I believe in a phenomenal brother says we believe in Divine Healing we believe in the power of God I believe if we're lacking those things we're missing out on the benefits of the Gospel brother B says we believe in old time you say well you you your your you're you got some new religion no we got old religion it's the oldest religion that there is hallelujah we believe in Old Time heartfelt salvation yes I believe in a heartfelt if it's not coming from the heart if it's just something that we that we come and sit on a Pew and warm our spot on Sunday and we just come for you know uh for our for a social gospel or some sort of a uh you know Cosmopolitan experience I'm here to tell you friends I believe in heartfelt salvation where I can get down amen and beat on the back of some poor sinner that'll break them through to the Holy Ghost and change their life they don't have to worry about going to AA and and all kinds of uh you know addicts anonymous and Alcoholics Anonymous and amen I'm here to tell you about a gospel that'll change you that you can walk out of here as sober and straight and never look back ever again in your life you say how do you know that because I done been there amen and got the T-shirt Hallelujah I know what it's like to roll out of bed in my own vomit amen I know what it's like to wet my own bed as a grown man I know what it's like to crawl around in a gutter and wonder where my next meal is going to come from but I also know the power of the Living God who's able to take that desire 100% away from me Hallelujah to deliver me from sin and sex and filth and perversion and take it out of my heart to Amen to never look back amen been there I know that it's a gospel that works amen believe in people's Liberty to say amen and praise the Lord hallelujah oh you get into some Churches and you wonder you know you wonder if they even believe the things that you're preaching they just sit there and stare at you like a mule looking at a new gate they just they they they don't even know and and and the ears going forward brother Braham said h h h wondering well it just shows where your daddy is hallelujah oh but when somebody can hear the word of God and something stirs up in their soul and they can wave their hand and tears run off their face unbidden amen and say I know that that's the truth and I believe it amen a little woman named hadie wght one time said brother brandom that ain't nothing but the truth amen and her two boys fell over her lap and wept their way to God I believe in that kind of religion goes on to say I believe we believe in the people's Liberty to say Amen praise the Lord and whatever the spirit of God leads you to do do it am and he won't lead you to do anything but what's right he goes on to say now the church believes in the baptism of water in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of sins after repentance amen so he clarified something here because a lot of people think that they get saved in water or just because they got baptized that that means that they're saved or that their sins have been remitted no their sins are remitted when they repent their sins are remitted when they turn from sin when they when they when they when they weep their way to God God and and are justified by faith and then you can go to the water and the promise of the Holy Ghost is there for you amen it goes on to say it believes talking about the church it believes in the baptism of the holy spirit with the fruits of the spirit following yes amen the fruits of the spirit longsuffering gentleness patience these are attributes but remember the fruit is in the root yeah whatever was in that original seed's got to come out if you got something coming out that's contrary to these things and I wonder what the seed was you may need to come back to the seed patience good goodness meekness we believe in nine spiritual gifts oh amen you mean tongues and interpretation ain't everything you know hey we would love to have it but you know according to the scriptures we find that tongues and interpretation of tongues was under judgment well the church the bride isn't under judgment we've received our message for this day we've heard of legible intelligible voice now not to put away the tongues and interpretation because it brother ra tells us that they keep the church clean but what about the other seven that's what I want to ask questions about because we got seven more that are still functioning and need to be uh operated in every uh in in every local assembly he said nine spiritual gifts all nine of them wisdom and knowledge then he goes into the five Ministry gifts teachers Apostles prophets Gifts of tongues interpretation of tongues Divine Healing those things we believe amen so this is a message or a gospel that works it's got all the all the mechanical parts are in in in order they're connected the Bible tells us that every joint supplying amen all right so then he comes down and I and I'm not going to spend a but this applies across the board because in verses two and three he talks about aged men and aged women then it goes on down talks about young women and then young men so we don't want to spend all of chapter 2 talking about these things but we want to call your attention to this one thing that when he when he gives the the the the description of what the age men what you're going to teach the age men he does basically the same thing to the age women and to the young women and to the uh because the he he he just kind of repeats these things but maybe changes the order a little bit so for the sake of time we're just going to uh uh give you a few descriptions i s here verse two says that you're going to so chapter one he talks about the ministers chapter two you're going to preach sound Doctrine which uh uh uh speak thou things which become sound Doctrine verse two that the Aged men uh be sober grave uh temperate sound in speech in charity and patient okay then he goes to the aged women likewise so everything that applies to the Aged men applies to the aged women in their uh uh in their gender so just want to throw this out here for you the word aged men there and aged women it speaks of maturity that's what it speaks of it speaks of an elder it literally means an ambassador so here so these aged men are ambassadors in other words they are the signature representative an ambassador is a signature representative of a nation and I put this myself what the message is to produce so so any man that is uh of marrying age or a father or a grandfather any woman that is of marrying age that that could be a mother or that is a mother or a grandmother this applies so the greater part of the congregation that you are ambassadors you are you are Titus all right you are a Christian you are what the message is supposed to produce that when at the end of the day when when when the poster child for uh uh uh for the message of the hour is to be the that that that that picture is to be taken you could stand there and the reason for that is is because there's younger that need a living example amen and so here you are the Aged men the aged women the the mature adults in the church that you're to be sober now the word sober there is the word nefos now this is really uh it's real deep like you know uh this is probably going to blow your mind but the word sober means not intoxicated that's deep but it gets better it means free from negative influences it means clear minded it means circumspect and I like this last one it means free from LIF dominating influences and so so so likewise women likewise young men likewise young women soberness you go and read the scripture it'll tell you likewise and it'll give you the list and soberness falls under every demographic and so we realize then that that that qualifies each and every one of us that this soberness will well of course we're not we're going to be free from intoxicants we're going to be free from those things but what about free from Life dominating influences what about circumspect what this is this is what all of us have to come to we need to look around you friends and we need to see the bigger picture that it's not all about me it's not all about number one but this is this is somebody that we have to be concerned about everyone when a drunk gets drunk he's only thinking about one person and that's himself now he loves everybody but he's really only thinking about himself cuz he'll tell you that he loves you if he gets drunk enough they love everybody but they really only love themselves they only they're only trying to exit their their their present and the now oh my what is it it's just a life of selfishness but what about the free from Life dominating influence you know I and we have to come back and and I know every preacher Under the Sun has preached on social media and Facebook and all these kind of things but it's it's the modern it's the reality of today that how much of the the the the gaming and the and the videos and the and the Facebook and the shorts and The Tick Tock and all these things it consumes our life it's not sin to look at those things if you're looking at it through the thinking man's filter and that's that's that I we all you know get a kick out of some of those things but what about when it life dominates what about when it consumes you when you can't even sit down at a decent meal with a group of people and keep your face out of your Facebook what about what about when you can't even have a when your wife is really really needing to talk to you and you and you got your buds in and you can't hear a thing she's saying and she's trying to spill her guts oh my what what what about the man that'll stand up pay attention listen to the needs of his children and look at the LIF dominating things that are over swelling into his house cuz remember you are the moon you're the one that controls the tide of what's coming into your house and you've got to point your finger and say get back amen am tells us here that this this this Christian is to be grave not like six feet under grave but that word grave there means dignified the Bible tells you to be dignified dignity that means do things that are honest that are that are uh that are honorable that that you you that you won't say something because it says sound in speech brother sister young people yeah you got one mouth and two ears that means you listen twice as much as you talk because people will say things don't say things you'll regret think about what you're going to say before you say it don't just blurt things out amen think about it sound in faith in charity in PE in patience I want to as we get ready to close here that they the speaking of the of the aged women but this applies to the Aged men as well that they be in Behavior as becometh Holiness not false accusers not giv to much wine teachers of good things now then that word good there it's another one of those deep words it means good are you with me Teach good things things that are noble things things that are holy things things that are of good report teach those things and that's to teach to the younger women why because that is the criteria that is the the curriculum that the Elder women have been given to teach the younger women to Elder men are given to teach the younger men hey follow me as I'm a follower of Christ put on the Lord Jesus Christ put on Holiness for without Holiness no man shall see the Lord so we we we realize then that there is uh the the uh uh two basic parts of teaching and anybody that's a teacher will agree with this you teach by two basic components number one by example remember this I've said it before you've heard it your children will never do what you say they will only do what you do so if you have an attitude your kids will have an attitude if you if you have a temper your kids will have a temper you know if you you know if you uh you know God forbid if you smoke don't tell your children not to cuz they will it doesn't matter I'm I'm guilty my kids not that I smoke but my mother did and my father did and my you know my my aunts and my uncles and they said don't you never pick this nasty habit up well what did I do pick the Habit up you know don't you never drink don't you never drive and drink and what did we do we drunk and drive you know or we got drunk and drove one of the two we did both and so what was it it was we we but the teaching of their lip service had nothing no effect on us only what they did you're so you teach by example there's a second part to that you teach by repetition you repeat the same thing over if you repeat the same behavior over and over and over in front of your children if you make the house of God every time the church doors open your children won't know any better they will be through those Church doors every time that whether they have the Holy Ghost or not why because you have instilled in them by repetition and by example that the house of God is where you're going to get help and without this the you're not going to get saved just because you come to church but because you come to church and you get under the presence of the word of God brother Jason's preached this for years amen the light goes forth it drives the darkness back and when it drives the darkness back the light can strike the seed Hallelujah as our musicians come I want to close with this little quote here from marriage and divorce brother B says and the bride we're talking about because all Christians are by feminine designation there're we're we're we're all under bride category we're all whether male or female is irrelevant we're under Church bride brother B says I'll no longer call you church I call you bride and so brother B talks about the bride here he says and the bride will be a lovely little lady of the word that's a Christian that's what Christian means a lovely little lady of the word unadulterated not touched by any man's organization any man-made Theory shall be purely unadulterated Bride of the word amen and amen amen friends we we've come a long ways through the years we had to Wade through Troubled Waters we've TR we had to Wade through church splits lost loved ones divorces backsliding leaving the message every kind of thing we we've waited through it and we're still standing amen we're going to make it I'm going to make it I'm not quitting I'm not giving up I'm not turning around amen no I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to keep pressing on that's that's the bride's Little Anthem I'll keep pressing on pressing on to higher ground but God's given us a formula he's given us a he's given us a an owner's manual think about it he's the owner and this is his manual and if you got something that's broke what do you do you go to the owner's manual you find out oh well this is what you got to do you got to sometimes you just got to reboot the thing you just got to go in and go back to default settings repent give your heart to the Lord quote the sinner's prayer go back to Romans 10 and agonize before God and get free from the thing that's bound you down it's just just a good simp simple gospel it it works it's we got all the equipment we got all the parts are all there sometimes you know something gets out of alignment well you just got to got to just adjust it a little bit get it back in get back in line that's what the prophet screamed out as the bride was in those closing hours get back in Step get back in line maybe this evening was just a little something to wave the flag this evening and say get back in line friends don't don't let the don't let the world drag you down don't don't let it don't let it upset you go back to that sound Doctrine go back to the things that Prophet taught us what we believe to be the truth and it'll hold you it'll hold you in the darkest hour of your life oh my when when when you don't know which way to turn because you can't see your hand in front of your face this age is is lightless this age is is is completely blacked out brother R said that he put a little bit of light in that last picture that seventh age he said I put that there remember that he put that there he said why so there will be a little bit of light in the evening time for the bride of Christ amen lead us out brother [Music] Tony my heart oh God God make it ever true change my heart oh God God may I be like you that's what I want Hallelujah you are are the P I am oh M me [Music] and this is what I pray change my heart oh God oh God make it ever true make it ever true change my heart

my heart oh my grant it to us tonight Lord M make it ever true oh that's beautiful change my heart oh [Applause] God may may I is that your desire tonight be feasting on the word my I was just so enjoying that I [Music] tonight I was as I Was preparing getting ready for service you know I think that Paul talks about you know we die daily right right we die daily and you know I I think that is such an important aspect of being a Christian and I think about that a lot I think Lord your mercies are new every morning there's got to be a reason for that I always Avail myself of his new mercies every morning think about that brand new out of the box never been used never been used ready to go no adjustment needed God's full mercy and I I think like that because I want God moving unhindered in my life is that pretty simple and so you can imagine then I always think about that even extra when I'm coming to the house of God lord I want to come in here tonight I don't want anything to hinder I want to hear the word I want to feel the flow of the Holy Spirit I need church I need the fellowship I need I don't know about you but I need to hear the word of God I need to hear it preached I need to preach it myself and then of course you know inevitably that kind of prayer lead you to thinking sometimes and such was the case for me at church and I began to think think about just as a preaching from a preaching standpoint I said Lord what is it what's what's the greatest piece of advice what's the real you know that real thing that that can because we know that the Holy Ghost brother Bram said you might shout you might not you might run you might not you might dance you might not he said but one thing you will do that you will come subject to every word of God and of to have more control and more victory over this flesh am I like that I mean I'm happy for control but I'd like to have even more I'd like to be every day where the Holy Spirit can just flow through me every day no matter where I'm at I'm on the job I'm in the market I'm at home I'm in the car I I'm I'm talking to someone on the phone I want the Holy Spirit and I stood there talking to the Lord about that Lord I thought I said surely your word is sufficient it ought to be the Gospel of Jesus Christ and I thought that I left I left that conversation thinking Lord your word is enough and if it's not enough it ain't on you it's on me for not applying it and so when brother Dale and he starts talking about this this thing is it gets the job done amen it ACC it's it's it's uh it functions holistically I said Lord that is exactly what I needed to hear tonight the simple Gospel of Jesus Christ works it works if you'll apply it in your life you'll have Victory you don't need great tremendous we love we love to Rejoice around great great understanding in the Deep things of God sure don't we don't we but I'm going to I'm going to tell you something friends every day whether I get a a deep Revelation I want to live pleasing to the Lord in my daily walk my daily walking talking life as I go around so I want you to think about that I'm ask brother Tony to sing that again I only have one prayer request sister Jean turned in if you've got one send it to me straight away but I want you to think about that that the gospel works it it it accomplishes the job it'll get the job done it'll give you soundness of speech soundness of doctrine soundness of teaching soundness of faith I'm glad that the Lord you say what is the Lord's will for my life to make you sound in faith and Doctrine charity patience love all these different things now hey how many want that say Lord I'm willing tonight right now I mean I I love that brother Dale said hey you know maybe you're born again maybe you've had an experience of the Holy Ghost but maybe you would also like to say tonight Lord how about I have a fresh cleansing a fresh purging a fresh strengthening a fresh anointing oh I want that so desperately because the day and the hour that we liveing is such a desperate hour I'm here to tell you friends that Dark Age We no match for it it's Ane of impossibility but in Christ we can do all things amen change my heart change my heart God now make it a prayer change my heart oh make it ever true yes Lord raise up them hands and sing it heart sing it to Jesus now think about him close your eyes and think about the Lord may I be like Lord may I be like you change my heart Change My Heart Lord oh change my heart oh Change My Heart Lord oh make it ever make it ever true Lord all

you anybody got a testimony tonight before we go Sister Sarah Amen Let me find a [Music] microphone oh you got one after all right let me thr the power button here well we might not be using this one let see oh there we go okay I think it's on so uh I just wanted to share this um a few weeks ago uh I happened to be in bluon running some errands and I was in the um Ashley Furniture Store parking lot and you know if you're coming out of that parking lot and you're trying to go right it's very very difficult and um because the oncoming traffic and the traffic coming from off the exit ramp it's just it's very very hard and I hesitated going that way and I was like I don't know about this I probably should turn around and go the other direction I thought no it'll be okay I'll just take my time well I stopped and the people coming from the right um saw me trying to get out so they stopped their vehicle well it was a box truck and I couldn't see around the box truck to see the next Lane beside him and so I was inching out inching out inching out and I was trying to see and I noticed coming towards my left the lane was clear and I thought well I'll just inch out a little bit more and then I'll gun it and go and just about the time I did that a car came and he slammed on his brakes he literally put his arms out straight and I could tell he put everything into slamming on his brakes I could literally see the whites of his eyes he was so close to my car and I thought I'm going to be hit and at the same time I looked up to see if there was something else I could do and a semi TR was coming from the other side and I was like I don't know what to do I said Jesus help me and I somehow I whipped the car around and got into a to the turning lane going towards the right and I was able to zing on through there without the semi truck hitting me or the car hitting me and so I was telling Brad about that and he said what time was that and I told him and we figured out that it was about the same time he was on the other end of bluon and he said for some reason he said he was in his car and the Lord just struck his heart and he said Lord keep my wife safe today wherever she's at glory wow and so that was just a miracle because if that car had hit me it would have spun me over into the other lanes and that semit would have hit me and I wouldn't be standing here right now wow glory to God praise the Lord prise the Lord so last Sunday um I had an issue with my eye had been bothering me for two or three days I'd cut I think is what happened I think I'd got some stuff in my eye and it cut my eye like the cornea pretty bad and I've done that multiple times but this thing just would not quit it any light that hit it I'm sitting up here last Sunday those lights were killing me but it was just horrible I had sister Meredith look at it for me and she couldn't find anything in it or you know I even had Esther drive us to church which is a pretty big deal so but I went and got prayed for after service and I didn't it's not like anything just moved me to go do it or anything big but I just asked God I was like Lord I got to have my eyes to work yep and I can't even open my ey can't even drive right now cuz it's super painful but they laid hands on me and I opened my eyes during the prayer and I felt a pretty significant puff of wind go into my right eye and as soon as it did that it was absolutely zero pain right after that you can even go watch it on the archive I was I was holding my eye closed and right after that my eye was open and just totally fine but not only did I ask for that I to get healed I want perfect vision I wear contacts and glasses but I'm I'm going to get that perfect vision soon [Applause] so I wanted to give glory to the Lord on this um so we had Uriah at home and what that means is that I have to do all the paperwork for his birth certificate so which is a pretty extensive process it took me several hours and two doctors and had to get I had to go and get their uh their endorsement and it just took me a really long time and so I had everything prepared after a couple of weeks and I sent it out just priority mail and you know I was just kind of didn't think about it and a week goes by and I was like well I have a tracking on it so let me just go ahead and see where it is you know it's supposed to be there in one to three business days with priority mail and I checked it and it started in Hilton Head it got it went to Florida and then it went to Columbia which is where Department of Health is which is where it's supposed to be and then it went to Charleston and at this point at 7 Days Later it said that it was in route to the next facility so I was like okay well I'll just look again next week so the next week I looked it was uh Tuesday or Wednesday of the next week and it just still said the same thing just in route to the next facility and you know they say after seven eight business days you should probably call Cuz priority mail is usually pretty quick so I was kind of discouraged about it cuz it took me a long time and I didn't think to make I could have gotten everything done again but it just would have taken me a really long time brother J just pray to the Lord just ask him you know just he he cares about our lives he cares about the little things and so I I went home and I was just telling my wife and I was telling my mom just kind of discouraged I was like Mom will you just pray and uh Lord Lord answered her prayers so you know and I was like Mom will you pray and joy will you pray and let's just pray and so then we prayed about it I just put it in the Lord's hands and the next day um I went on and I called the person who it was supposed to to receive it and I was like hey did you get happen to get it I've been tracking it and they said no we haven't gotten it but I'll call you when when we do I said okay I went on and I tracked it and I made an inquiry so um just you know to see where it was this was almost almost at 2 weeks later and the next day I got a phone call from the lady at the Department of Health and said hey I received the package um you know you paid too much for priority mail but we got it you know two almost two weeks after and so I was like okay well I want to go look and cuz I know that it was the Lord that did this I went and looked at the tracking and they still had no idea where it was and I got the inquiry you know they go and they do an investigation I got a phone call this Monday you know 10 days after I made an inquiry and the guy is like baffled he's like I don't know where your package is I just can't seem to find it anywhere you know I don't know I don't know where it is and I said well it made it to its destination so just wanted to praise the Lord for that I just know it was him doing that hallelujah amen amen praise the Lord the Lord knows how to take over a situation don't he amen amen any others before we go I'll give one more oh oh wait we got two more okay who who said that me oh okay go ahead you got a mic stand by Elijah stand by uh I just want to thank the lord for keeping his hands on us through this uh hurricane it hit us at a category one and completely almost devastated Our Town everybody's been without power for most of the time they finally got power back to downtown so restaurants and stuff could open in the grocery store but we have a ton of Big Tall Pine trees and ones that did fall thank the Lord fell the opposite direction of the house there's only a few branches that hit the house so all of our our home and our cars everything was safe and then it's been really hard to find stuff I had to come all the way here just to get a generator um and they had just got a shipment in brother Luther was going to let me borrow his but ended up finding one able to buy it and um but then even just things like gas and ice and uh I didn't want to keep open the fridge and run the generator all the time so I just said something to the neighbor the other day cuz I saw he had something he well I went up to my lake house and uh that's where I got ice I was like okay but then he came back by that evening he had two big old buckets of ice he's the superintendent at the school and he's like well I went out to the school and they they got the power on the ice machine was making ice so I brought you some ice wow so he got me two big old buckets of ice and keep my drinks coold and have to keep open the fridge praise the Lord praise the Lord the Lord hand amen amen amen Lord right there you go so um it was a couple days ago I was riding my bike in the front yard um there was this car in this driveway it was backing up for some reason I stall and I couldn't turn I couldn't pull on the brakes but for some reason my arm grabbed on the brakes but I didn't mean to and I'm really thinking F that God saved my life and that I didn't get hit I'm glad I'm amen me too brother Elijah um same thing happened to me um was very dizzy since Michigan and um I was actually doing everything the doctors was telling me to do which was resting and drinking water and salt and everything and it act it was actually getting worse so my motto in life is just keep pushing let God you know he'll heal you just keep moving forward so I did very very much struggling and um I just went up for prayer and went home I took a long nap and I just kept telling myself you know I'm going to wake up the next morning and I'm going to feel so much better and that's exactly what happened praise God I just want to thank the Lord I'm still unstable but you know every day it just gets a little bit better and I'm just so thankful praise the Lord amen praise God we're going to let you go
