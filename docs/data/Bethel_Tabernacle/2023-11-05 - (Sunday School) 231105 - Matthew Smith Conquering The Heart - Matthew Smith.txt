TRANSCRIPT
========================================
um we'll start at at verse one Deuteronomy Deuteronomy 5 and verse one says um and Moses called all Israel and said unto them here o Israel the statutes and judgments which I speak in your ears this day that you may learn them keep and uh and keep and do them the Lord our God made a covenant with us in Horeb the Lord made not this Covenant with our fathers but with us even us who are all of us here alive this day the Lord talked with you face to face in the mount out of the midst of the fire lord add his Blessing to the word you may be seated um so the way I I kind of came about I I wanted to do a little bit of a a study of Deuteronomy it's it's kind of really kind of become a little bit of a new book to me um somewhat recently just because um I Heard a a Bible scholar um talking about um some of the ancient various ancient uh things in the scripture and he mentioned that one of the ways that they were able to as historians kind of place um the book of Deuteronomy in in the timeline historically is that the way it's written follows very similarly to a certain pattern that they find in other writings of the day amen specifically there's a um type of treaty they're known as Covenant treaties that are were primarily out of the um hittite Kingdom the hittite Empire and but they also were just around the whole sort of Middle Eastern Area even down into Egypt and things like that places like that and there's a certain structure to these to these treaties and the idea was that in those ancient times um that people had certain um obligations and duties and and moral obligations that you had to fulfill in order to be you know a good person right you know you have obligations to your family you take care of your family you you um you know you you're you're you have obligation and and the way you behave towards people is is you there's Bond a bond of kinship between you and your family that you kind of you have to uphold to that and so when your family's in need you help your family when when you know there's you know if they come under attack then you go to defend them things like this well if you're not part of the family well tough luck you're not part of the family get call your own family you know but when you have somebody that you need to build a bond with you need to build a covenant with that's not part of your family what they would do they would build these Covenant treaties and the and the idea within the Covenant was that by both parties coming together and and signing on to this Covenant you are becoming family right we actually understand this um and they would do this in those times as well but the way that it would do this we can see a a version of this in the modern time is through marriage um which might get into later but the idea is that you know here's somebody who is not your flesh and blood but you're going to build a bond in a covenant with that person who then becomes your ultimate kinship right even you know the Bible says that a man would leave his father and mother in Cleveland to his wife so here's you know even even your wife would even become more kin to you you who's ideally not related and yet and yet she's more akin to you than even your your own blood relations and so likewise you know with these when you would have two great kingdoms you know two kings would meet to build a covenant with each other um we can see in these ancient treaties that they they would refer to each other as brothers right that they that because they have now have this Covenant with each other they are now Brothers but that's if you have two equals right we we actually see this if when there's a a we have a copy one of these treaties in which the Egyptians met with the Hittites and it refers to the Pharaoh and the king of the Hittites as brothers but what we're a little bit more interested in is this other type of treaty in which one which which the parties are not equal this is what they called um a surain treat uh SU rain vassel treaty it's the it's the historical term that they use assus rain is a ancient term or a middle eastern term for in English what we would might refer to as like a lord um so we would in in a vassel it would be like a nation that is subservient to a much larger more powerful Nation so what would happen is you would have a great powerful King come in and he would make a covenant with some much smaller nation and the the the the purpose of the Covenant was that the smaller Nation now owes Allegiance and loyalty and taxes and tribute and all these things to the larger Nation but the larger Nation more powerful Nation owes them protection and and if they come under attack that his his armies are going to protect them that if there's famine in the land he he's going to muster his kingdom to provide food he's going to take care of them and the idea there was that it was a the Greater King was the father and the Lesser nation was their was his children and so when under that kind of treaty there's a certain framework that we see in all these different treaties that we found through various kingdoms and if you look at the book of Deuteronomy it hits every single one of the of the criteria that we would use for one of those treaties that it is literally God the father making a covenant to to his children and saying I am I have declared myself your king and here's and and so he he goes through a bunch of um and because it it follows that framework historians were able to place they were able to authenticate Deuteronomy as a as a as a historical document um that they were able to Modern um you know biblical historians use that as a major indicator because the idea here being being that the people of the time would have been very familiar with that type of of contract that type of treaty and so especially Moses having been educated in Egypt he would have been very well familiar with this framework so when the Lord is coming to him and that he's writing this out it's it's matching this contract framework and he's able to recognize and that it's it's it's the Lord trying to present this in a way that the people are going to understand that is his legally binding contract with his children that that binds them as his family right um and so there's a couple couple things that we can I I would like to um go through that at some point um but I want to lay a little B more framework first um the other thing that to bear in mind about the historical context of the book of Deuteronomy is that the the if you read through it and this is pretty evident from just reading the the book um it's the last thing Moses writes before the children of Israel enter the promised land and it's this it's Moses laying out you know discussing the Covenant discussing the history of where the children of Israel came from why they're there what they're doing and it's his instructions of you're going getting ready to enter the promised land and this is what you can expect when you get there this is what you need to do to enter the promised land this is how you're going to go about it this is the things that you need to bear in mind once you get into the promised land this is you know when you encounter troubles here's how you're going to uh approach them you know here's how you're going to overcome these things and here's how God expects you to behave once you get there and it's it's it's the reason why I I I really appreciate this is because and I'm I'm sure anybody who's um well familiar with with uh the message may have you might have heard of this before um I like this this particular quote in this isn't from questions and answers brother brandham says um Canaan right the promised land is a type of the Holy Ghost Egypt Egypt is a type or is the world that they came out of the Wilderness is where they were Sanctified called out Church Canaan is where they settled down with the holy spirit cuz they still had Wars and if you don't believe you have wars just get the Holy Spirit once right and so this once you kind of tie all these things together right that the that the you know that the the book of Deuteronomy is God's covenant with his people that that ties them together as father and children and and binds them all together and it's his promise that you know here's here is how you know who I am and and why I'm going to take care of you this is what I you are now obligated to do there's all kinds of blessings and curses associated with with obedience or Disobedience right it's also your instructions of how to enter into the promised land and for us the spiritual context of this is this is our instructions in a type of how God expects us to enter into the Holy Spirit and what we can expect you know as Christians as Born Again Christians and so it was such an edification to me because you know that statement where he says you know just get the Holy Spirit and you'll realize just how many warriors you actually have you know so often times we get this idea we get this mentality that oh you know especially if you're a new Christian or you know maybe maybe you're just an old Christian who's been at this for a while and you think oh I'm I'm going to become a Christian I'm going to get the you know the the be a born again Christian and then my troubles will all be over it's like you're going to you're going to break through and Conquer and then it's all going to be over but that's really not true at all that's I mean that's when your Wars actually start there's a a um you know we you know uh when the children of Israel did enter into Canaan you know they have this this first battle that they have is with Jericho right and it's a great it's a great you know great Victory everything you know the Lord just knocks the walls down and it's this great moment of Conquest this great moment of victory that they you know that they they Rejoice so much but what they you know what you know their next battle that they fought they got the stuffing beaten out of them yeah right and so many times you know Christians you especially like I said new Christians will come they'll come along and they'll get the Holy Spirit you know they become a Christian they become born again it's it's all great and it's all wonderful and they have a great victory in their life this big stronghold in their life that was you know they were facing that they couldn't overcome the Lord will just knock it down for them and then they'll the next thing that they come across will just run them right over they have and it just just Falls flat and the first thing they do is scratch their head go well I guess not I must not have been a Christian after all right well I guess you know well you know there went that you know might as well pack it up and go back to Egypt right like well no don't do that the problem is what happened was more like than not that first victory that you had there's still some little piece of it hanging out in your life somewhere right in in Deuteronomy chapter 7 um pull this up here pull up the verse here it's verse 22 um so this is this is God telling the children of Israel to not be afraid of these strongholds that they're going they going to face um well I'm going to go back to verse 19 it says the great Temptations which Thine Eyes saw and the signs and the Wonders and the mighty hand and the stretched out arm whereby the Lord thy God brought the out so shall the Lord thy God do unto all the people of whom Thou Art afraid moreover the Lord thy God will send the Hornet among them until they that are left and hide themselves um and hide themselves from thee be destroyed Thou shalt not be afed of them for the Lord thy God is among you a mighty God and terrible says and the Lord thy God will put out those Nations before thee little by little or by little and little um thou mayest not consume them at once lest the beasts of the field increase upon thee and so again reiterating that we have this idea a that you know you become a Christian and you you have this great victory in your life and suddenly well you're not going to encounter any more hardships right there's no there's no more uh struggles you're not going to have any problems within yourself that you're going to have to overcome well no that's not how that works the the lord gave a promise that it's going to be little by little right you're you know you're going to you're going to conquer one's stronghold and he's not going to let you move on until that thing is is annihilated right if there's any little piece of it left you'll try to go onto something else and you'll just fall flat on your face until you go back to the last place that you got Victory and really make sure you nailed that down right like you better not have any you know any little shred of it you know oh you know people so many times people want to get a victory in their life and like oh yes the Lord I gave me victory over this thing in my life but you know here's the little remnants of it that I don't want to stomp out you know I want to keep some little thing here or there that some little piece of this that I didn't want to totally destroy well don't do that you're going to you're going to end up not moving past that and you're never going to have victory in your life until you really burn it all down until you're really willing to give up every little piece of that you know I I found it so you know this morning I was thinking about this and the and it just so struck my heart you know the Lord has promised Israel a piece of land you know just a big patch of dirt and so many people that the there was this moment where people had the opportunity to enter into that and possess the land that he had he had promised them that was actually part of a covenant that he' given to Abraham right they had they had an obligation to take that land because they were the Seed of Abraham um I it strikes me um if we turn to Galatians chapter 4 the Lord put this on my heart this morning and I want to get to it um in Galatians chapter 4 and verse 21 it says um we're going to read all the way down to the end of the chapter it says uh tell me ye that desire to be under the law do you not hear the law for it is written that Abraham had two sons the one by a bond made and the other by a free woman but he who was of the Bond woman was born after the flesh but he of the free woman was by promise which things are an allegory for these are the two covenants the one from the Mount Si which uh guardeth or gendereth to bondage which is agar for this agar is Mount Si in Arabia andth to jerus um and answer to Jerusalem which now is and is the and is in bondage with her children but Jerusalem which is above is free which is the mother of us all for it is written Rejoice thou Barren that bearest not break forth and cry thou that travail us not for the desolate hath made more children than she which hath a husband now we Brethren as Isaac was are the children of promise but as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the spirit even so it is now nevertheless what saith the scripture cast out the Bond woman and her son for the son of the Bond woman shall not be Heir with the son of the free woman so then brethren we are not children of the Bond woman but of the free okay what struck me about this little passage of scripture is that here Paul is identifying that there is Mount Si in Arabia and another mountain of Jerusalem in Palestine okay and that you have the children of of Jerusalem and then you have the children of siai and that Sinai is of the Bond woman which is in Arabia and that Jerusalem is of the free woman right or the descendants of Sarah and therefore Isaac which is in Palestine which and the allegory that he's referring to is of course Hagar and Ishmael being the the son you know ishmail being the son of Abraham through Hagar and Isaac being the son of Abraham through Sarah okay today we can see this playing out right now right you have Sinai you have Arabia which is controlled by the children of is Ishmael to this day I just recently saw a video of an of an Arab man talking about the conflict in in um Gaza right now talking about how you know the Arabs don't really have a squabble with Israel so much because they understand that they're the children of Israel and they have their inheritance and the Israel has their inheritance in Israel and they don't really have a squabble with them because they're both under their inheritance as their as their you know father had you know this is and so if we look at this in in in the in Exodus and Deuteronomy here you have sin this place of the law where you have under sanctification you have people walking around under a law that they know they're supposed to do right but there's there's no real there's no Holy Spirit within them to change them to make them do right so they're constantly under judgment and bondage under a legalistic dry desert Wilderness system but then you have under the children of Jerusalem Israel they're of the free woman in the promised land and so you have the where you had the children of Israel are walking around in the desert around SI they go up to the promised land and they they were given the opportunity to enter into the promised land and then they got afraid of the battles that they were going to face once they did so and so they returned back and just walked around in varying degrees of sanctification for 40 years right they just they just didn't go anywhere they never really entered into the baptism of the Holy Spirit and so what's this is this is an indication of an you this in the book of Deuteronomy where he's telling that history of as they traveled to the promised land they would come to various people they came up to Moab they came up to um Edom they came up to all these different places and every time the Lord would say you're not going to stay here this is their inheritance right we come to the land of Edom you're going to pass right through Edom this is the inheritance of the children of Esau this isn't your land you're going somewhere else okay you're just going to pass through you know they would come up to Moab well this is the inheritance of the you know of Lot's children we're not going to take that from them right we're going to go to our inheritance and so it what's an indication is when they got to the to the border and ready to enter into the promised land and then they chose not to do it what they're doing is implicitly saying we are not Seed of Abraham because if they were they would have gone to their inheritance you can't how are you going to say that you're a Seed of Abraham if you're not conquering and and dwelling in your inheritance right this is why brother Brandon would say that a that a Jew outside of the Holy Land is backslid right and so likewise as Christians so many times will encounter these situations you know people will be see these strongholds and they'll say well you know I can't do that right they'll they'll be they'll know that they should be living right they'll know that they should be you know because they have the law right they've been taught what's right and wrong they know what they ought to be doing but they'll say ah I I can't live a Christian life because these many Giants of you know bitterness or lust or or uh a you know grudges and anger and all these things that they they don't see away how in their own flesh that they can overcome right because as as Christians the Lord hasn't really given us a patch of dirt so to speak somewhere we don't have a a piece of real estate to go declare the holy land and declare our inheritance he's just given us this human flesh dirt that is our inheritance right and so many times we'll look at our own flesh that is completely corrupted with the seed of Cain right full of giants of of all these things within us that you know of desires and and and and and um and you know just things that we can't overcome that we can never overcome Within ourselves and say well these Giants are way too big for us so clearly this holy ghost thing isn't for me right clearly this and so and so people will just back away from it and say well I can never give up whatever it is right you have some you know addiction or whatever and and then they'll just back away from it and and then just go off into the Wilderness for 40 years but the call is the call is to is to say but you can it it's the it's to have the faith to say yeah the Giants are going to remain there even once I possess it and I'm going to have to take years of growth to overthrow those strongholds but but little by little I'm going to possess everything that the Lord has promised me and uh that went by really quick and I had a lot more material um so we'll have to end it there um maybe I'll get an opportunity to kind of continue this thought I have a lot more material on it um but we'll stand and turn it over to the musicians and hope that was an encouragement to you and um have a word of prayer here oh Father Lord we we want to come before you this morning and and thank you for this opportunity to hear your word Lord that maybe something that would have been said or heard would would have touched the people's heart and that they would be able to hold on to it and they would go forward in faith and recognize that anything that the devil would come before them is is a is a lie father they have a right to possess their their promised land lord they have a right to their inheritance of peace and of joy and and and of Deliverance of anything that would hold them bound so father Lord just be with your people open our hearts Lord we we open our hearts to you Lord and ask that you would pour out your spirit upon on us and that we invite you into this congregation Lord as the musicians come we want to worship your name and worship your who you are father and that you would be pleased to come down and dwell with us a little bit this morning Father come speak to us in the preaching of the word father we ask these things in Jesus name amen amen
