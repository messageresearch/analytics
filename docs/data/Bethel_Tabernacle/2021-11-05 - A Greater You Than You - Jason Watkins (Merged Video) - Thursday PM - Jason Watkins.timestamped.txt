[8:41] something special for us this weekend
[8:44] amen i don't know of a time in my life
[8:48] that that i've seen the devil fight
[8:50] something harder
[8:52] than this youth camp
[8:54] he's fought it he's had a a
[8:57] well-tailored specific i mean uh nuclear
[9:01] attack he unlaunched on our church just
[9:03] uh here youth camp was coming up and
[9:06] we've had a few covet cases here and
[9:08] there never really had an outbreak and
[9:10] man just a few weeks before camp this is
[9:12] actually beginning of october one family
[9:14] second family third family fourth family
[9:16] covid kovacova just a massive outbreak
[9:18] we're having to cancel church we have
[9:20] brother jason to mars who goes into the
[9:22] hospital with it there was so much
[9:24] uncertainty surrounding everything and i
[9:26] knew it was just a storm an attack of
[9:29] the enemy trying to shut things down
[9:32] but somebody was praying
[9:35] and there was hearts i believe of you
[9:37] and your needs and your family and your
[9:39] parents who were praying and i believe
[9:41] that those prayers the bible says the
[9:44] the prayers of a righteous man avails
[9:45] much
[9:46] and the holy spirit moved in a
[9:48] supernatural way and the devil who
[9:51] thought he was going to put a stop to
[9:52] something about the time that everybody
[9:54] was out of quarantine and all of our
[9:56] days were over and everybody was
[9:58] recovered and brother jason comes out of
[10:00] the hospital it's camp time
[10:02] now the devil didn't design it that way
[10:04] but god knew what he was doing all along
[10:07] and not one person who was sick and and
[10:10] and feeble that couldn't have come to
[10:12] camp in that condition every single one
[10:14] of them are here tonight
[10:17] you ought to give the lord a handclap of
[10:18] praise for that
[10:20] hallelujah
[10:22] amen
[10:25] glory
[10:27] so i want to let the devil know right
[10:28] now you can try you can do all you want
[10:31] you can throw all the assaults you want
[10:32] but god wins in the end and the devil's
[10:36] a loser
[10:37] somebody say he's a loser
[10:39] he's a loser and he's going to lose
[10:41] we're the winners amen we want to get to
[10:43] the song service we have a lot amen here
[10:45] tonight we want to get to uh but i want
[10:48] to just make some
[10:49] reading announcements i got to just go
[10:51] over some of these before we begin a lot
[10:54] of these you heard some of the
[10:55] counselors heard some of this you got
[10:57] through way of email
[11:00] and and and different forms but so if
[11:01] these are repeated just make sure you
[11:03] listen up because these are real close
[11:05] this will be our camp orientation none
[11:08] of y'all have been here before and we've
[11:11] only been here a few times we took a few
[11:12] trips here scouting trips so uh i got in
[11:15] the golf cart to take a couple people uh
[11:17] today and i said where are you going and
[11:19] they said i'm at such and such and they
[11:21] and i said do you know how to get there
[11:23] and they said no i said neither do i so
[11:25] we're in trouble i had to pull out the
[11:27] map and then find out how to get there
[11:28] but we made our way so uh the property
[11:31] uh is is vast it's large
[11:34] lots of lots of it covers a lot of acres
[11:37] um so we we have some specifics and some
[11:40] things some guidelines we want you to
[11:42] follow
[11:43] while you're here at camp to make sure
[11:45] everybody has a good time
[11:47] there is
[11:49] weather better weather predicted for
[11:51] tomorrow so we know the master of the
[11:54] wind and we're going to pray how many
[11:55] will pray say lord give us good weather
[11:57] throughout camp supposed to turn around
[11:59] and get a little bit better in the
[12:00] morning and fortunately
[12:02] we're going to have a little bit of
[12:03] sunshine i'm not really sure so
[12:05] everything that we have on the schedule
[12:07] announced is going to be barring the
[12:09] weather and then we'll go as we as we
[12:11] can and play it by ear play other things
[12:13] by ear
[12:14] so i'm going to read through some of
[12:15] these um as we said in the emails
[12:18] campers aren't allowed to leave camp so
[12:20] once you're here you park your car
[12:22] unless there's an emergency you can't
[12:25] leave you've got to stay here
[12:27] and there's a gate that locks at night
[12:28] so we want to make sure that you're here
[12:30] there's also a buddy system that they've
[12:32] put in place that we want you to follow
[12:35] i'm going to get to that here in just a
[12:36] moment
[12:37] and at lights out
[12:39] um
[12:40] security will be making rounds the
[12:42] security team will make around to each
[12:44] dorm it lights out just to make sure uh
[12:47] everything's okay lights out will be
[12:49] will be given to you now
[12:51] if you signed up and opted in for the
[12:53] mass text that's one of our best ways of
[12:55] communication to get something to you
[12:57] fast

[13:00] group text it'll be announced other ways
[13:02] your counselor get it and make sure that
[13:04] you know
[13:05] but lights out time is where is the time
[13:08] that we put on there i think was 11 30
[13:09] is what's on the schedule
[13:11] depending on what the lord does in
[13:12] services depending on what will happen
[13:14] after that may change
[13:17] um

[59:41] and he gives a lot more detail to things
[59:43] than samuel did in the books of the
[59:45] kings
[59:47] samuel wrote first and second kings ezra
[59:50] was a scribe who penned first and second
[59:52] chronicles and

[59:57] that
[59:58] samuel left out on some really big
[59:59] things

[1:00:33] and the establishment thereof
[1:00:36] synocrib king of assyria came and
[1:00:38] entered into judah
[1:00:40] and encamped against the fenced cities
[1:00:43] and thought to win them for himself
[1:00:46] and when hezekiah saw that cinecrib was
[1:00:48] come and that he was purposed to fight
[1:00:50] against jerusalem
[1:00:52] he took counsel with his princes and his
[1:00:54] mighty men to stop the waters of the
[1:00:56] fountains which were without the city
[1:00:59] and they did help him
[1:01:00] so there was gathered much people
[1:01:02] together who stopped all the fountains
[1:01:05] and the brook that ran through the midst
[1:01:07] of the land saying why should the kings
[1:01:09] of syria
[1:01:11] come and find much water
[1:01:13] also he strengthened himself and built
[1:01:16] up all the wall that was broken and
[1:01:20] raised it up to the towers now it's this
[1:01:23] is all really good productive stuff but
[1:01:26] there's a little bit of
[1:01:28] sadness in my mind as i read it i'm
[1:01:30] thinking you know hezekiah why did you
[1:01:33] need to quickly go and rebuild
[1:01:35] everything just because the enemy was
[1:01:36] approaching you know why why do we wait
[1:01:39] until we're in a trial to pray why why
[1:01:41] is it that we hold back and then and
[1:01:44] then we dial nine the heavenly 9-1-1
[1:01:48] and we end up treating god like a
[1:01:49] vending machine
[1:01:51] or santa claus which he's neither
[1:01:54] see
[1:01:55] so he's looking for more of a
[1:01:57] relationship with you than that and he
[1:02:00] goes on to say and he raised up to the
[1:02:02] towers and another wall without and
[1:02:04] repaired milo in the city of david and
[1:02:06] made darts and shields in abundance
[1:02:09] and he set captains of war over the
[1:02:11] people and gathered them together to him
[1:02:13] in the street of the gate of the city
[1:02:16] and spoke comfortably to them saying
[1:02:19] be strong and courageous
[1:02:21] be not afraid nor dismayed for the king
[1:02:25] of assyria
[1:02:27] let me read verse 7 again be strong and
[1:02:29] courageous be not afraid nor dismayed
[1:02:32] for the king of assyria
[1:02:34] nor for all the multitude that is with
[1:02:37] him
[1:02:38] for there be more with us
[1:02:40] than with him
[1:02:42] now considering that he had
[1:02:44] the syrian army was nearly a quarter of
[1:02:47] a million strong
[1:02:48] this isn't a numerics about humans that
[1:02:51] that hezekiah is referring to but how
[1:02:54] many know that little as much if god is
[1:02:56] in it
[1:02:57] how many know that you and jesus
[1:02:59] constitute a majority
[1:03:03] see and so he says there be more with us
[1:03:06] than with him with him now here's why
[1:03:10] with him is an arm of flesh but with us
[1:03:14] is the lord our god to help us and to
[1:03:17] fight our battles and the people rested
[1:03:19] themselves upon the words of hezekiah
[1:03:23] king of judah there's nothing to bring
[1:03:25] peace like the promise of the word
[1:03:29] you got a trouble tonight let me give
[1:03:31] you some promises of the word verse 20
[1:03:34] and for this cause
[1:03:36] hezekiah the king and the prophet isaiah
[1:03:39] the son of amos prayed and cried to
[1:03:41] heaven and the lord sent an angel which
[1:03:43] cut off all the mighty men of valor and
[1:03:46] the leaders and captains in the camp of
[1:03:47] the king of assyria so he returned with
[1:03:51] shame of faith to his own land and when
[1:03:53] he was come into the house of his god
[1:03:56] they that came forth of his own bowels
[1:03:58] these his own sons slew him there with
[1:04:01] the sword
[1:04:02] thus the lord saved hezekiah and the
[1:04:05] inhabitants of jerusalem from the hand
[1:04:08] of synacrib the king of assyria and from
[1:04:10] the hand of all other and guided them on
[1:04:14] every side
[1:04:16] father we thank you for your word this
[1:04:18] evening i pray master that you will come
[1:04:22] and anoint your word mightily lord
[1:04:24] i just want to stand here and just be

[1:04:35] found myself lord as i just began to
[1:04:38] look over and follow the leadership of
[1:04:41] the lord i found myself here in second
[1:04:43] chronicles i believe it's you i believe
[1:04:46] there are needs that will be met here

[1:05:29] nope
[1:05:32] all right just getting used to
[1:05:35] okay this
[1:05:40] how many know that god purposed you
[1:05:43] before the foundation of the world
[1:05:47] how many knows that
[1:05:49] that before there was ever stardust the
[1:05:52] word of god existed
[1:05:54] and you existed in that word
[1:05:57] that is why you're here tonight
[1:06:00] this is why you're a believer this is
[1:06:02] exactly why the word has its
[1:06:05] predestinated
[1:06:07] effect on you
[1:06:08] and it not only affects you but it
[1:06:11] effects change in your life because it
[1:06:13] doesn't do any good to just be affected
[1:06:15] by the word you want to for the word to
[1:06:18] effect a change in your life that's why
[1:06:21] you're a christian because i'm here to
[1:06:23] tell you something friends uh i i get it
[1:06:25] that sometimes the battles can get
[1:06:28] really hot and heavy and even at even at
[1:06:31] your young age there's many of you
[1:06:33] already have surmounted tremendous uh
[1:06:36] obstacles in your life and many of you
[1:06:38] tonight could testify and say brother i
[1:06:40] had this crisis in my life or that
[1:06:42] crisis and i'd say my you're so young
[1:06:44] but the devil is no he doesn't wait till
[1:06:47] somebody gets some age on him he starts
[1:06:49] early he starts trying to derail you he
[1:06:52] comes into your childhood tries to
[1:06:54] invade your home you ought to be
[1:06:56] thankful for godly parents and pastors a
[1:06:59] man and family who will pray for you and
[1:07:01] apply a token to a home you don't you
[1:07:04] won't know until the other side how many
[1:07:07] times the angels interdicted on a move
[1:07:10] the enemy had planned for your life you
[1:07:12] got up on any morning like every other
[1:07:14] morning you got ready for school or a
[1:07:16] job or wherever you were going you're
[1:07:19] headed to the market or you're headed to
[1:07:21] see a friend or you're headed on a
[1:07:22] vacation and there were there were demon
[1:07:25] forces conspiring in a realm you
[1:07:28] couldn't see but also in that same realm
[1:07:31] there were angels moving on your behalf
[1:07:37] and you will be surprised on the other
[1:07:39] side to learn just how many times they
[1:07:42] stepped in to thwart the enemy for you
[1:07:46] we find that everything that god does is
[1:07:49] purposed
[1:07:50] and you know that he's he's not a
[1:07:53] purposeless god jesus even said of the
[1:07:56] word of god that there's not even a word
[1:07:58] of it'll pass away
[1:08:00] that actually
[1:08:01] that that that god values his word above
[1:08:04] his name
[1:08:05] and we find that not even a jot or a
[1:08:08] tittle not one iota i mean that's you're
[1:08:10] getting down to punctuations and and
[1:08:13] even smaller than punctuations and
[1:08:15] there's not nothing in the bible that is
[1:08:18] a contradiction it's written by men over
[1:08:21] hundreds and hundreds of years all from
[1:08:24] one central mind
[1:08:26] that saw me and saw you before the world
[1:08:29] existed
[1:08:32] god has a vision of you
[1:08:34] god has been moving your entire life
[1:08:37] whether you
[1:08:38] you say well i you know i'm actually
[1:08:40] just here tonight because a friend
[1:08:41] brought me i'm not even i'm not even
[1:08:43] born again i'm here to tell you
[1:08:45] something friends if there's anything in
[1:08:47] you to respond to the word of god you
[1:08:50] existed in the mind of god and god had a
[1:08:52] plan
[1:08:55] god had a plan before you didn't know
[1:08:57] you would want it
[1:09:00] god had a plan before you decided you
[1:09:02] didn't want it
[1:09:05] i'm here to tell you that if god is
[1:09:07] determined to do something you're not
[1:09:09] going to stop him
[1:09:12] and if he is determined to track you
[1:09:14] down i'm here to tell you he will send
[1:09:16] the fisherman and he if that angler
[1:09:18] can't catch you he'll send another
[1:09:20] fisherman and if that one can't catch
[1:09:21] you he'll put a change of lure and use
[1:09:23] another fisherman but understand finally
[1:09:26] if a fisherman can't get you he will
[1:09:28] send the hunter
[1:09:32] a hunter don't miss the holy ghost gets
[1:09:35] his man or his woman he's not he's not
[1:09:38] going to let the enemy take one of his
[1:09:41] offspring from his possession
[1:09:44] my advice to you tonight would be
[1:09:46] surrender
[1:09:49] my advice to you tonight now is just
[1:09:51] throw up your hands and say lord i
[1:09:53] surrender right now
[1:09:55] i remember
[1:09:57] somebody said one time that a
[1:10:00] preacher and a lawyer had went to church
[1:10:02] and they were both as world as could be
[1:10:03] in their buddies
[1:10:05] and my goodness the sermon got going and
[1:10:07] they both fell under conviction and they
[1:10:09] hit the old sawdust trail
[1:10:11] and they fell at the altar
[1:10:13] and my goodness that doctor he rolled
[1:10:16] around and he screamed out four or five
[1:10:18] minutes and jumped to his feet and
[1:10:19] thrust both hands in the air and said
[1:10:21] i'm free
[1:10:23] i'm free
[1:10:25] and that lawyer just you know he looked
[1:10:27] at that he went back to praying and he
[1:10:28] prayed for an hour and two hours and
[1:10:31] they beat him on the back and they
[1:10:33] they they caught on the name of the lord
[1:10:35] and finally after about three hours of
[1:10:36] rolling around in the sawdust he jumped
[1:10:39] to his feet under the power of god he
[1:10:40] said i'm free hallelujah they're walking
[1:10:43] home
[1:10:46] and the
[1:10:47] the lawyer says the doctor says hey bud
[1:10:48] i'll ask you a question sure sure but go
[1:10:51] ahead what is it he said isn't god good
[1:10:53] oh yeah he's good good old time oh all
[1:10:55] the time said i'm so glad he what he did
[1:10:57] for us tonight yes isn't it wonderful he
[1:10:59] said doc he said this is one thing i
[1:11:01] don't understand he said what is it pal
[1:11:03] he said you know he said when you got
[1:11:05] down in five minutes you jumped up full
[1:11:07] of the spirit of god
[1:11:09] he said for me i had to stay down there
[1:11:11] two or three hours
[1:11:12] and he said i don't understand that and
[1:11:14] the doctor laughed and he said oh that's
[1:11:15] easy he said that's just because i'm a
[1:11:17] doctor and you're a lawyer
[1:11:20] and he said well what's that got to do
[1:11:21] with and he said well when you got down
[1:11:23] there you started pleading your case i
[1:11:25] just told him i'm guilty
[1:11:29] don't plead your case friends just raise
[1:11:31] up the hand and say i'm guilty lord
[1:11:34] and i need your help
[1:11:38] 6 000 years of
[1:11:40] the histories of mankind
[1:11:43] has made it difficult if if not
[1:11:46] impossible
[1:11:47] for him to accept or
[1:11:49] really even even perceive that the
[1:11:52] word truly um
[1:11:55] you know is in control of everything
[1:11:57] that the word of god is controlling
[1:11:59] everything now i i could take a whole
[1:12:01] sermon which i love doing and and
[1:12:03] correlating history to prophecy because
[1:12:05] you can see that all of the pro all of
[1:12:07] the history that's ever been was
[1:12:09] controlled by prophecy the the current
[1:12:11] day you're living in is being controlled
[1:12:13] by prophecy don't ever let anyone tell
[1:12:15] you that politics are controlling it or
[1:12:17] the white house or the vatican or the
[1:12:19] kremlin they're not in control of
[1:12:20] anything they're puppets
[1:12:23] prophecy is controlling the world
[1:12:27] and it's hard for man to perceive that
[1:12:29] the world after 6 000 years of his
[1:12:32] histories
[1:12:33] is truly coming to a major upheaval
[1:12:37] of everything he has understood since
[1:12:40] the fall in the garden
[1:12:43] since that faithful day
[1:12:45] six thousand years ago mankind has
[1:12:48] basically had to make his own way in the
[1:12:51] world through trial and error through
[1:12:54] successes and failures through ups and
[1:12:56] downs and sometimes just dumb luck
[1:12:59] or not
[1:13:02] for fallen man to be able to grasp and
[1:13:04] to be able to
[1:13:06] come to terms with the fact that the
[1:13:08] whole thing the whole thing all the
[1:13:11] histories all the events
[1:13:14] of history
[1:13:15] have been a grand production
[1:13:19] that is being accomplished by god to
[1:13:22] fulfill his purposes and his goals
[1:13:29] time itself is a creation of god set in
[1:13:32] motion
[1:13:33] to achieve an eternal purpose think of
[1:13:35] the irony of that god set time in motion
[1:13:38] to achieve an eternal purpose
[1:13:42] moreover for him for fallen man to now
[1:13:44] realize
[1:13:46] the fact that the purposes of god
[1:13:50] are being finished up
[1:13:53] right here in the day and hour in real
[1:13:55] time this is happening in real time
[1:13:59] this isn't a joke this is serious
[1:14:01] the world is like a garment that's waxed
[1:14:05] old and it's ready for renewal
[1:14:08] they can cry all they want to and i'm
[1:14:10] not here to argue the science of the
[1:14:11] politics it's all of the devil anyway
[1:14:15] but i i know what's going on if the
[1:14:17] world's got a global warming and the
[1:14:18] world's got all kinds of trouble i know
[1:14:20] exactly what it is it's the earth knows
[1:14:23] it's about the transition and the earth
[1:14:25] is already going ahead and making
[1:14:26] changes
[1:14:28] [Applause]
[1:14:29] say myer polar caps are melting you
[1:14:31] ain't seen nothing yet honey
[1:14:34] they're going away completely
[1:14:36] even the deserts are going to blossom
[1:14:37] like a rose
[1:14:39] hallelujah
[1:14:40] oh i'm to tell you something friends our
[1:14:42] retirement plan is out of this world
[1:14:47] the world as he has known it has fallen
[1:14:50] mankind humanity
[1:14:53] the world as humanity has known it is
[1:14:55] approaching its end game there are in
[1:14:58] fact even as we speak tonight
[1:15:00] catastrophic judgments that are rushing
[1:15:03] to meet us
[1:15:04] and i'm here to tell you the only way
[1:15:06] out is up
[1:15:09] hear me again tonight friends there are
[1:15:11] catastrophic judgments rushing to meet
[1:15:14] this world and the only way out is up
[1:15:19] i want to go up
[1:15:21] hallelujah
[1:15:24] the principle is
[1:15:27] that whatever is not eternal
[1:15:29] must pass away
[1:15:31] however long it may have survived now by
[1:15:35] all human odds and i get it i get why
[1:15:38] it's a struggle for a fallen man to get
[1:15:41] his mind wrapped around what we're
[1:15:42] saying tonight by all human odds it
[1:15:44] should continue just as it always has
[1:15:47] just as it always does
[1:15:52] but against but odds against a principle
[1:15:55] are no match
[1:15:58] i don't care what the odds are
[1:16:01] the principles of god's word will
[1:16:04] prevail you should just take that and
[1:16:08] and speak peace into your own life
[1:16:10] tonight i don't care what the odds look
[1:16:12] might be stacked against you but if your
[1:16:14] life is based on the principles of god's
[1:16:16] word you have to win
[1:16:19] you can't lose
[1:16:22] see satan could actually win if he
[1:16:24] wasn't if it wasn't for always losing he
[1:16:26] could actually win but he can't win for
[1:16:29] losing
[1:16:30] and so we find that this 6 000 year epic
[1:16:33] drama
[1:16:34] has been and i say this unapologetically
[1:16:38] unequivocally it has been perfectly not
[1:16:41] partially it has been perfectly
[1:16:44] controlled it has been perfectly
[1:16:47] purpose-driven
[1:16:48] by the only source of eternal existence
[1:16:52] and life itself and that is god
[1:16:57] that's it there's no other answer god is
[1:17:00] in control of everything he's not only
[1:17:04] the god of good men he's the god of all
[1:17:06] men
[1:17:08] he's not only the god of the good he he
[1:17:11] he puts rings in the nose of of emperors
[1:17:14] and kings and leads them to his will i'm
[1:17:16] here to tell you something friends you
[1:17:18] don't have to you don't have to abide in
[1:17:19] the spirit of fear that's on this age
[1:17:22] you've been given a different spirit
[1:17:24] you've been given an ability to receive
[1:17:27] the word of god and receive the life
[1:17:29] that comes out of that world
[1:17:32] god alone
[1:17:35] man's six thousand year reign in a
[1:17:36] fallen condition is now fulfilling its
[1:17:39] final purpose
[1:17:40] and it's time
[1:17:42] to move on
[1:17:46] there is i think when we look at our
[1:17:48] text in second chronicles where
[1:17:51] i believe that any of us as believers
[1:17:53] would believe tonight that there is an
[1:17:55] incomparable difference really
[1:17:58] in trusting in the in the lord
[1:18:01] versus trusting in the arm of flesh
[1:18:05] they're so far apart they're not even
[1:18:07] comparable
[1:18:08] i would love to use one as a contrast
[1:18:10] but they're just too far apart
[1:18:12] when you
[1:18:13] are going to trust the lord
[1:18:16] you that is a mutually exclusive term
[1:18:18] you're not trusting the lord and
[1:18:20] trusting the arm of flesh at the same
[1:18:22] time
[1:18:23] perfect faith and perfect fear are
[1:18:26] mutually exclusive terms they can't both
[1:18:28] be true at the same time in a believer
[1:18:32] we have come to the age of perfect faith
[1:18:35] in a time of perfect fear and it's
[1:18:37] gripping the world
[1:18:38] but god has given you something better
[1:18:41] god has given you a peace and a faith
[1:18:44] and a belief that that god is in control
[1:18:47] of it all
[1:18:50] the king of assyria found this out the
[1:18:53] hard way
[1:18:55] this fallen world offers many challenges
[1:18:57] many challenges would you agree
[1:19:00] many trials
[1:19:02] many afflictions jesus never
[1:19:05] promised us it would be easy
[1:19:09] only that it would be worth it
[1:19:12] i want to tell you something today young
[1:19:14] man young woman it will be worth it
[1:19:18] oh will it be worth it
[1:19:22] job would
[1:19:23] make the comment and say that a man born
[1:19:26] of a woman
[1:19:28] he's just a few days and he's
[1:19:30] full of trouble
[1:19:33] and you know
[1:19:35] why i think it's a fair question
[1:19:38] why is trusting in the lord such an
[1:19:40] advantage over the arm of flesh
[1:19:44] and and there are many things that i
[1:19:46] could say on that tonight i just want to
[1:19:48] angle into one particular side of this
[1:19:50] mountain that be all right
[1:19:52] what is
[1:19:54] trusting in the lord why is it such an
[1:19:56] advantage
[1:19:57] over the arm of flesh
[1:19:59] because for one thing
[1:20:01] flesh looks forward trying hard to bring
[1:20:05] things to pass
[1:20:07] but those who put their trust in the
[1:20:09] lord know that the lord has accomplished
[1:20:11] it already
[1:20:14] so you can take the arm of flesh and you
[1:20:16] can try to make a life out of this out
[1:20:19] of this few days and full of trouble
[1:20:21] good luck with that i'll put my trust in
[1:20:23] the lord who has already sealed every
[1:20:26] divine promise
[1:20:28] it's already accomplished for me
[1:20:34] anything you will ever need from the
[1:20:36] cradle to the grave i got a message for
[1:20:38] you it's already done
[1:20:41] everything brother branham would say
[1:20:43] everything that you have need of for a
[1:20:46] rapture
[1:20:47] is in you
[1:20:50] now
[1:20:51] not coming it's now
[1:20:53] whether you're born again or not if a
[1:20:54] gene of god is in there for a new birth
[1:20:57] that's in you now
[1:20:58] you don't come to an altar and become a
[1:21:01] son or daughter of god you find out you
[1:21:03] always were and now by the baptism of
[1:21:05] the holy ghost you're able you're now
[1:21:08] free to cooperate in the vision
[1:21:11] that god had a view god had a vision of
[1:21:14] you
[1:21:16] bible says that that even when jesus was
[1:21:19] suffering on the cross he would see a
[1:21:20] seed and be satisfied
[1:21:25] everything you have need
[1:21:26] of god has done it already
[1:21:30] you know i saw an interesting interview
[1:21:34] they interviewed a nasa engineer quite a
[1:21:37] number of them when they were
[1:21:39] making the mars rover and
[1:21:41] they had a very wonderful celebration
[1:21:43] because they successfully
[1:21:45] landed the rover on mars and it's
[1:21:47] operational and sending back pictures
[1:21:49] and they've even got a little drone that
[1:21:52] they had to build specially has to be
[1:21:54] computer driven nobody can the
[1:21:56] atmosphere's so light and and and there
[1:21:58] were so many so many possibilities for
[1:22:01] it to go wrong it was quite a feat of
[1:22:03] human engineering ingenuity and
[1:22:05] engineering
[1:22:06] and this nasa engineer when he's being
[1:22:09] interviewed
[1:22:10] he he starts talking they say you know
[1:22:13] where were you nervous
[1:22:15] and he says
[1:22:16] that's that's that's an understatement
[1:22:19] he said
[1:22:20] that this is the culmination of years of
[1:22:24] years more than a decade of the greatest
[1:22:27] minds gathering over year after year
[1:22:30] after year after year for a landing
[1:22:33] that's going to be over in about a
[1:22:35] minute
[1:22:37] and all of this effort has been poured
[1:22:39] into that when that thing comes down the
[1:22:42] retro rockets will fire the separation
[1:22:44] will happen the parachute will deploy
[1:22:46] the feet will come down and everything
[1:22:47] will happen synchronously and it'll have
[1:22:50] a touchdown and it won't break
[1:22:53] and it'll be operational
[1:22:55] and everything will work and this is
[1:22:57] years and years of our lives invested in
[1:23:01] a few terrifying minutes
[1:23:04] and that thing's falling i i forget how
[1:23:06] many hundred miles an hour
[1:23:08] toward mars
[1:23:10] and he actually as he as he was telling
[1:23:13] the story
[1:23:14] he was literally sweating telling it
[1:23:17] and the interviewer even even said to
[1:23:19] him said you're sweating now just
[1:23:21] telling the story and he grabbed the
[1:23:22] handkerchief he goes you're right man
[1:23:24] i'm reliving it all over again
[1:23:27] because he he had to sweat it out and
[1:23:29] and he said he said because you you've
[1:23:31] got to realize he said
[1:23:34] at some point he said and i don't
[1:23:36] remember exactly why but he said
[1:23:38] communication goes dark and we're in the
[1:23:40] dark
[1:23:41] we know nothing all we know is we're
[1:23:43] we're descending and that's it
[1:23:46] and and it doesn't come back around and
[1:23:48] we don't get a video feed and we don't
[1:23:50] know what happened until the rotation
[1:23:52] comes around and the video feed hits the
[1:23:54] earth again it takes minutes to get here
[1:23:56] and when it comes on the screen we will
[1:23:58] know if we have disaster or if we have
[1:24:00] triumphed and they had triumphed when it
[1:24:03] came back on you should have seen my
[1:24:04] goodness i didn't know scientists could
[1:24:06] jump like that and they were screaming
[1:24:07] and hollering and running all over the
[1:24:09] place and hugging one another and crying
[1:24:11] and
[1:24:12] and and he said he said listen he said
[1:24:14] you don't realize the agony because
[1:24:17] that knowing whatever was going to
[1:24:20] happen
[1:24:21] had already happened
[1:24:25] and we're sitting there
[1:24:27] and there's i mean we're anxious
[1:24:30] but what's the point
[1:24:32] because at this point whatever has
[1:24:34] happened has already happened
[1:24:37] and and we find out that he he could
[1:24:40] only wait for the outcome to declare
[1:24:42] itself when the video feed made it back
[1:24:45] to the earth over many many agonizing
[1:24:47] minutes
[1:24:48] i want you to think through this with me
[1:24:51] he could wait in hope
[1:24:53] but wishing wouldn't make it so
[1:24:57] he could have some measure of human
[1:24:59] faith
[1:25:00] i mean i'll give him that based on
[1:25:01] meticulous preparation and engineering
[1:25:04] that it went into the whole thing
[1:25:06] but but these would be very little
[1:25:09] comfort while he waited it out while he
[1:25:12] sweated it out there was no if you think
[1:25:14] about it friends there was no peace even
[1:25:17] possible until he could see
[1:25:21] physically see the mystery revealed
[1:25:26] there's no way
[1:25:27] see he couldn't have he actually had to
[1:25:30] wait to get peace he had to wait to see
[1:25:33] it
[1:25:35] while he can't see it he's in agony
[1:25:37] while he can't see it he knows
[1:25:39] whatever's happened has already happened
[1:25:41] and it's just going to be what it's
[1:25:42] going to be and when the screen comes on
[1:25:44] either we've succeeded or we failed and
[1:25:46] that's it
[1:25:48] there's nothing i can do i can hope upon
[1:25:50] a star wish upon a star count my lucky
[1:25:53] stars but wishing isn't going to change
[1:25:56] anything
[1:25:58] and even the faith i've got is only a
[1:26:00] little bit of human faith based on all
[1:26:03] the work that we put in it all of his
[1:26:05] human hope and all of his human faith
[1:26:08] were made moot by the reality of what
[1:26:11] already existed
[1:26:16] he could only wait anxiously
[1:26:18] to see what the unalterable outcome
[1:26:22] would turn out to be
[1:26:23] all that could be done to help the
[1:26:25] situation had already been done during
[1:26:29] the time of construction and programming
[1:26:32] this
[1:26:33] i want to say to you tonight friends
[1:26:36] this when you're leaning on the arm of
[1:26:38] flesh
[1:26:40] this is the best life can offer you when
[1:26:44] you lean on the arm of flesh all you can
[1:26:47] do is give it your old notre dame try
[1:26:50] and hope for the best but i'm here to
[1:26:52] tell you there's a better way
[1:26:54] there's a better way than the arm of
[1:26:56] flesh
[1:26:59] i feel sorry for mankind who won't trust
[1:27:02] god i feel sorry for mankind who leans
[1:27:05] on the arm of flesh i feel sorry for
[1:27:07] them and that's why the bible says in
[1:27:09] this last day men's heart would fail for
[1:27:12] fear now you know when i know there is
[1:27:14] no greater fear for a human than the
[1:27:17] fear of the unknown
[1:27:18] that's why you won't go in a dark room
[1:27:19] without turning light on that's why
[1:27:21] you're walking in a dark alley you hear
[1:27:23] a sound you're creeped out
[1:27:25] why because you don't know what it is i
[1:27:27] can't see oh what a way that's that and
[1:27:30] and that is the greatest fear and man's
[1:27:32] heart is failing for fear of the unknown
[1:27:36] and here we are tonight with the open
[1:27:38] book and the full mind of god revealed
[1:27:42] you are such a privileged people you're
[1:27:44] so privileged my brother my sister don't
[1:27:47] take what god has done in this hour
[1:27:50] lightly
[1:27:53] hallelujah
[1:27:55] this is the best life can offer you when
[1:27:58] you lean on the arm of flesh but my eyes
[1:28:02] see a different reality i'm looking to a
[1:28:05] preparation from back in the eternities
[1:28:08] i'm looking for something that happened
[1:28:10] before creation was
[1:28:12] created hallelujah
[1:28:16] all the construction and labor on my
[1:28:18] behalf
[1:28:19] that happened
[1:28:21] before i got here
[1:28:25] but before anything got here before
[1:28:28] anything got here listen friend before
[1:28:31] stardust got here before stardust got
[1:28:34] here god had a purpose for my life
[1:28:37] so i i've had all kinds of failures yeah
[1:28:40] but i was purpose before i got here to
[1:28:42] fail
[1:28:44] hallelujah one of these days friends
[1:28:45] you're going to realize that nothing
[1:28:47] trumps that gene of god in you you're
[1:28:49] going to realize that there is now
[1:28:51] therefore no condemnation to them which
[1:28:53] are in christ you're going to take your
[1:28:55] failures and you're going to throw them
[1:28:56] back at the devil and you're going to
[1:28:58] say it don't matter
[1:29:01] it don't matter you don't matter satan
[1:29:05] i am a believer in the word of god
[1:29:08] i have given my heart and my life to
[1:29:11] christ
[1:29:16] it's not a hope or a faith that it will
[1:29:18] happen
[1:29:19] or neither is it a doubt that it won't
[1:29:22] happen
[1:29:23] hope has no voice in this
[1:29:26] that's why brother brandon would say
[1:29:28] hope is the worst enemy faith has
[1:29:31] see and so hope has no voice in this i'm
[1:29:34] looking at a promise that what he said
[1:29:36] he'd do he's already done it
[1:29:40] so how do you know because an open book
[1:29:42] is calling my name
[1:29:44] oh and i'm here to tell you something it
[1:29:45] seems to be a name it already knew
[1:29:48] hallelujah
[1:29:52] calling you calling me
[1:29:55] i know it called me because i hear the
[1:29:57] gospel trumpet
[1:29:59] draws me to this feast of the word i'm
[1:30:01] going to tell you something friends this
[1:30:02] is beyond me this is beyond a decision
[1:30:05] this is beyond me or you choosing
[1:30:08] this is someone
[1:30:10] that's already chosen me
[1:30:14] when the eagle flies over that gene
[1:30:17] brother branham said and eat when that
[1:30:18] eagle when that light flashes on that
[1:30:21] seed he said it'll come to life just as
[1:30:23] sure as anything i'm here to tell you
[1:30:25] something friends i found out that that
[1:30:28] there's a there's another being living
[1:30:30] inside me there's a better me than me
[1:30:33] i'm here to tell you tonight there's a
[1:30:34] you have access to a better you than you
[1:30:37] hallelujah there's there's an alien
[1:30:39] force inside me and it and it echoes
[1:30:42] from within me it it doesn't decide to
[1:30:45] believe god's word it echoes amen
[1:30:48] amen amen there's no decision there's no
[1:30:52] hope i'm not wondering i'm not trying to
[1:30:54] figure it out there's an alien voice
[1:30:56] inside me that says any man to every
[1:30:59] word of god
[1:31:04] how did it all happen brother jason all
[1:31:06] i know is that somewhere in the
[1:31:08] eternities morning stars sang together
[1:31:11] and sons of god shouted for joy and i
[1:31:14] was part of that group say how do you
[1:31:15] know because now that i hear the word i
[1:31:18] got the same shout for joy that they had
[1:31:20] when they heard the word
[1:31:23] they stood there and heard the word of
[1:31:25] god and they shouted for joy
[1:31:31] we know that the bible talks about a
[1:31:33] great falling away at the end time
[1:31:38] now i wanna
[1:31:39] dig a little deeper you good
[1:31:44] i want i want to i want to
[1:31:47] change my angle and dive a little deeper
[1:31:50] all right
[1:31:52] so when we think about
[1:31:55] the falling away
[1:31:57] that is to come at the end time
[1:32:01] we find too often times that
[1:32:04] what we are faced with and i know this
[1:32:05] authoritatively because i was
[1:32:08] raised in this message born into it my
[1:32:10] parents
[1:32:11] uh were in the meetings of brother
[1:32:13] branham i was a baby sitting there i was
[1:32:14] prayed for him healed of an incurable
[1:32:16] blood disease by proxy my dad's standing
[1:32:18] in a prayer line and me hundreds of
[1:32:20] miles away and the very instant it was
[1:32:21] pronounced that instant i was healed
[1:32:24] see so
[1:32:25] the time continuum isn't exactly what
[1:32:27] you think it is
[1:32:29] miles meant nothing
[1:32:31] when when god spoke to a prophet
[1:32:35] but we find too often
[1:32:38] a retreating from the ancient landmarks
[1:32:40] of the word
[1:32:42] now don't get quiet on me because i'm
[1:32:44] here to tell you brother jason i've seen
[1:32:46] this i've seen it from a boy growing up
[1:32:49] i've seen the old ways began to be uh
[1:32:52] drifted away from
[1:32:54] and you say oh is that but wait a minute
[1:32:56] the great falling aways that's happening
[1:32:57] in the world yeah that's fine what has
[1:32:59] that got to do with you and me i'm
[1:33:01] talking to you and me tonight i'm
[1:33:02] talking to sons and daughters of god i'm
[1:33:04] talking to believers and i'm here to
[1:33:06] tell you something that there's been a
[1:33:08] retreating from the ancient landmarks of
[1:33:10] the word and as a minister i want to i
[1:33:12] feel sometimes i want to say get back in
[1:33:14] step
[1:33:16] get back in line this is no time to be
[1:33:18] retreating from the ancient landmarks
[1:33:22] this is no time to water down the gospel
[1:33:25] with its transforming power if you want
[1:33:27] the transforming power of the gospel you
[1:33:30] take it like it is
[1:33:32] you take it straight you don't mix it
[1:33:34] you don't water it down you don't
[1:33:36] reconnect
[1:33:39] take it straight
[1:33:40] hallelujah
[1:33:44] too much diminishing
[1:33:47] a diminishing appreciation for the power
[1:33:49] of god
[1:33:50] bringing many sons to glory i'm here to
[1:33:53] declare that his word is unchanging
[1:33:57] i'm here as his officer tonight to make
[1:33:59] a declaration his word is unchanging
[1:34:03] it's just as powerful today as it ever
[1:34:05] was it still saves it still fills with
[1:34:07] the spirit of god it can still clean up
[1:34:10] your life it can still make the devil
[1:34:12] run from you
[1:34:13] [Applause]
[1:34:16] hallelujah
[1:34:18] it's unchanging
[1:34:20] there is still power in the blood
[1:34:23] there is still a holy ghost experience
[1:34:25] to be had and i'm not going to stand by
[1:34:28] and let preachers water that idea down
[1:34:31] as if you just make some mental decision
[1:34:34] or you're raising a message family or
[1:34:36] raising a message church nothing
[1:34:38] that when we leave here my church is
[1:34:40] going to burn under nuclear fire but it
[1:34:43] won't have anyone in there when it
[1:34:45] happens
[1:34:46] that's why i preach
[1:34:49] i'm not trying to get my building in a
[1:34:51] rapture i'm not trying to get my ipad in
[1:34:53] a rapture i'm trying to get you and me
[1:34:56] in a rapture
[1:34:58] hallelujah
[1:35:05] i'd like to just break into that tonight
[1:35:07] on the very first night how many would
[1:35:09] say well let's just break right into it
[1:35:11] tonight hallelujah that way when brother
[1:35:13] burley comes or brother john comes they
[1:35:15] don't have to drop back and hit these
[1:35:17] kind of things because we're already
[1:35:18] filled with the spirit of god we already
[1:35:20] got a church full of believers how many
[1:35:22] believers we've got in here tonight
[1:35:24] hallelujah
[1:35:29] satan knows he's very much aware
[1:35:33] that there are no contradictions in the
[1:35:35] scripture
[1:35:39] but it's not the scripture he fears
[1:35:44] brother branham holding up his own bible
[1:35:47] declared this is not the gospel
[1:35:50] the bible
[1:35:51] living in you
[1:35:53] that's what the holy ghost was given for
[1:35:57] it didn't come to increase your theology
[1:35:59] to give you better understanding over
[1:36:01] the baptist and methodists you do have
[1:36:03] better theology than them but that's not
[1:36:04] the point
[1:36:05] the point is that this thing is to
[1:36:07] become a living reality
[1:36:09] living behind mortal people living with
[1:36:11] all of our wrinkles and warts and ups
[1:36:13] and downs and weaknesses say you got
[1:36:15] them i got them you got them you got
[1:36:16] them we all got them we're all in this
[1:36:18] thing together
[1:36:20] hallelujah
[1:36:21] but i'm here to tell you we've got a
[1:36:22] heavenly father that knows who knows our
[1:36:25] weaknesses and knows how we're made
[1:36:27] knows and watched us in our molding and
[1:36:30] i'm here to tell you i don't care what
[1:36:31] you think about how you got here or what
[1:36:33] it is that's made up your life i want to
[1:36:35] go back and remind you that every step
[1:36:38] of a son and daughter of god whether
[1:36:40] it's before they be became born again or
[1:36:42] after is ordered of the lord
[1:36:45] and god is in control of your life say
[1:36:47] but i made all kinds of decisions and he
[1:36:50] let you because now he can redeem you
[1:36:52] and i'm going to tell you something a
[1:36:54] child of god who has come out of sin is
[1:36:56] a very valuable
[1:36:59] instrument
[1:37:00] in the hands of god
[1:37:04] satan knows there are no contradictions
[1:37:05] in the scripture
[1:37:07] so he moves to the spot
[1:37:11] where the connection is
[1:37:13] that transmits the written word or the
[1:37:15] spoken word
[1:37:17] into your heart
[1:37:18] and that's the mind and brother branham
[1:37:21] said that's the battleground
[1:37:23] that god
[1:37:24] and satan chose
[1:37:27] the mind of man
[1:37:29] because it's got to come here first
[1:37:31] and that's where satan is going to
[1:37:33] attack you with reasoning this is where
[1:37:36] satan is going to use your your five
[1:37:39] flesh
[1:37:40] body senses your your eyesight your ears
[1:37:43] your taste the things you put your hand
[1:37:45] to
[1:37:47] and he's going to use that as inlets to
[1:37:49] get to your memory and your reasoning
[1:37:50] your conscience your affection your
[1:37:52] imagination which are all in a fallen
[1:37:54] condition
[1:37:55] they're all in a falling condition none
[1:37:57] of them are none of those 10 are
[1:37:58] converted
[1:37:59] there's only one area of conversion and
[1:38:01] that's in the soul
[1:38:03] and that brother ram said that only has
[1:38:05] one sense either faith or doubt either
[1:38:06] you're born again or you're not
[1:38:08] you're not halfway born again there's no
[1:38:09] such thing
[1:38:10] you're either born of the spirit of god
[1:38:12] or you're not
[1:38:13] i understand growth and maturity but
[1:38:15] you're either born of the spirit of god
[1:38:16] or you're not
[1:38:18] and don't fool yourself thinking you are
[1:38:20] the devil would love to have you
[1:38:21] thinking you are when you're not
[1:38:23] and when you actually are born again he
[1:38:25] would love to make you think you're not
[1:38:26] born again
[1:38:28] he's a master of psychology don't don't
[1:38:31] fight him there and don't don't give i'm
[1:38:34] here to tell you something friends if
[1:38:35] you want the if you want a secret to the
[1:38:38] supernatural is keep your mind clear of
[1:38:42] laodicea's influence keep your mind
[1:38:45] stayed on the word of god feed on the
[1:38:47] word of god stop feeding on laodicea
[1:38:49] stop stop indulging in those things
[1:38:51] they're poison they're toxins
[1:38:57] and what he does is he comes to your
[1:38:59] mind
[1:39:01] because he knows there's no
[1:39:02] contradictions in the written bible
[1:39:05] so what he does is he comes to the spot
[1:39:09] where the connection is that leads from
[1:39:11] the written word to the living word
[1:39:14] and it's then lived behind human skin
[1:39:17] and he's not trying to make the bible a
[1:39:20] contradiction he's trying to make you a
[1:39:22] contradiction
[1:39:24] he's trying to fill your life with
[1:39:26] contradiction he's trying to give you
[1:39:29] the fashions of the world he's trying to
[1:39:31] give you all the popularity he's trying
[1:39:33] to get you to be one of the cool kids
[1:39:35] i'm here to tell you uh those kind of
[1:39:36] kids are gonna end up in a tribulation
[1:39:38] period i want to i don't want to be one
[1:39:40] of them i want to be the one who goes
[1:39:41] into glory with god
[1:39:43] [Applause]
[1:39:46] but understand how crafty he is
[1:39:50] he uses the things you listen to
[1:39:53] the things you gaze at because he knows
[1:39:55] the principle of the word better than
[1:39:56] you do he knows that we're tr changed
[1:39:58] into the things we gaze at
[1:40:00] that's that's a principle remember
[1:40:03] odds against the principle are no match
[1:40:05] say well
[1:40:07] i've been a believer all my life and
[1:40:09] odds are i'll stay i'll stay victorious
[1:40:12] not if you start violating the
[1:40:13] principles of god you want
[1:40:16] see
[1:40:18] so he's trying to
[1:40:20] create a contradiction
[1:40:22] between the word written in the bible
[1:40:24] and the word that's manifested in your
[1:40:27] life you know if you think about what a
[1:40:30] contradiction this age that we live in
[1:40:32] this is the age of
[1:40:34] of the selfie and uh of youtube and and
[1:40:38] and that that iconic phrase do you
[1:40:42] wow just do you
[1:40:44] no i'm not i'm not here preaching at
[1:40:46] selfies and youtube and and and slogans
[1:40:48] that's not even what i'm i'm talking
[1:40:50] about
[1:40:50] uh but what i what i'm i'm trying to get
[1:40:52] you to see the work of the enemy
[1:40:55] when you think about selfies when you
[1:40:57] think about
[1:40:58] youtube when you think about do you
[1:41:02] i mean how opposite is that to the path
[1:41:06] that christ took he made of himself of
[1:41:09] no reputation and took upon him the form
[1:41:11] of a servant and was made in the
[1:41:13] likeness of men and being found in
[1:41:14] fashion as a man he humbled himself and
[1:41:16] became obedient unto death even the
[1:41:18] death of the cross
[1:41:21] so i want to i want to
[1:41:23] make you aware of something i want to
[1:41:26] make you aware of this angle
[1:41:28] that the falling away at the end time
[1:41:31] is far more than just some people moving
[1:41:35] away from or abandoning truth in
[1:41:38] doctrine falling away at the end time is
[1:41:41] anything that moves you away from christ
[1:41:45] being first in every aspect of your life
[1:41:49] if he's not first in every aspect of
[1:41:51] your life you've already experienced a
[1:41:53] falling away
[1:41:55] though you might still be perfectly
[1:41:56] convinced of the teachings
[1:41:59] see
[1:42:00] it's not just about abandoning doctrine
[1:42:03] when he's not your highest thought and
[1:42:04] goal
[1:42:05] when he's not the center of everything
[1:42:07] you do you have fallen away so quite
[1:42:10] naturally
[1:42:11] quite naturally then the age of youtube
[1:42:14] and selfie and do you would would
[1:42:17] naturally be the opposite it would be
[1:42:19] the antithesis of having him first in
[1:42:22] your life
[1:42:24] it's real simple
[1:42:26] it's not complicated
[1:42:28] many people you know we'll
[1:42:31] we'll say to me tonight brother jason
[1:42:33] you know that's that's not my motive in
[1:42:35] watching youtube that's not my motive
[1:42:37] when i took a selfie that's not my
[1:42:38] motive when i said to my friend hey do
[1:42:41] you have a good time go have fun that
[1:42:43] wasn't my motive and and you know what i
[1:42:45] want to say friends that that that's
[1:42:47] fine i'm not indicting you this is about
[1:42:50] the spirit that's on the age and the
[1:42:52] motive and objective for satan of satan
[1:42:55] for your life it might not be your
[1:42:58] motive
[1:42:59] but i'm here to promise you it's his
[1:43:01] motive
[1:43:02] it's his motive to corrupt you it's his
[1:43:05] motive to poison you and and and we when
[1:43:08] we think about it in the simplest terms
[1:43:10] i can just ask you tonight just just
[1:43:12] think with me just answer this to
[1:43:14] yourself i don't need anybody to raise
[1:43:16] their hand or stand up or say yeah it's
[1:43:18] me i don't need you to say amen i just
[1:43:20] want you to think about a question
[1:43:23] go down your life your everyday walking
[1:43:25] talking life
[1:43:27] your everyday 24-hour life
[1:43:30] and just ask yourself one simple
[1:43:32] question is christ
[1:43:34] and his word
[1:43:36] first in every
[1:43:38] facet
[1:43:39] of my current
[1:43:41] life
[1:43:43] if you can identify
[1:43:46] any area of your life that he is not
[1:43:49] then that is a portion that you have
[1:43:53] allowed the god of this evil age to find
[1:43:56] a way into you
[1:43:58] and he's keeping you from being a better
[1:44:01] you
[1:44:03] god has a plan to make a better you than
[1:44:06] you
[1:44:07] and satan has just the opposite plan in
[1:44:11] mind it may not be as i said whether
[1:44:14] you're aware of it or not it might not
[1:44:15] be your motive it might not be your
[1:44:17] objective but it certainly is his
[1:44:19] objective and he's found room in you to
[1:44:22] work now you sit there young people
[1:44:24] listen think about that now
[1:44:26] i want you to really take measure of
[1:44:29] that in every one of you individually
[1:44:30] i'm looking at you right in the eye take
[1:44:32] measure of that
[1:44:33] is there anywhere in your life think now
[1:44:36] that you would have to be honest and say
[1:44:38] lord the truth is
[1:44:41] you're not first you're second but
[1:44:43] brother branham said he don't want
[1:44:45] second
[1:44:47] he don't want to be second he wants to
[1:44:50] be first
[1:44:52] i want him to be first
[1:44:55] remember friends that satan brother man
[1:44:57] taught us satan is almost powerless
[1:44:58] unless he can find somebody to work
[1:45:00] through so if he's working through you
[1:45:03] maybe in some unrecognized way then then
[1:45:06] just a then let me ask you now let me
[1:45:08] ask you a question what kind of damage
[1:45:10] might you be doing
[1:45:12] to those associated around you people
[1:45:14] you care about people you love
[1:45:18] because you have allowed the enemy to
[1:45:20] come and creep in and take some oh i go
[1:45:22] to church oh i go multiple times a week
[1:45:25] i read my bible but i ask you was there
[1:45:28] any area i'm here to tell you something
[1:45:30] friends jesus paid a price that makes
[1:45:32] him worthy to be first in every aspect
[1:45:36] of your life
[1:45:38] that's what the holy ghost
[1:45:40] is given for that's why
[1:45:42] and you know i want to say this the holy
[1:45:44] ghost and and my i have just
[1:45:48] it's uh it's such a burden on my heart

[1:45:55] ghost preached in such a way and
[1:45:58] and presented in such a way
[1:46:00] that made young people almost give up

[1:46:06] at all

[1:46:11] promise if you believe the word and

[1:51:56] overseas i stood in florida praying for
[1:51:59] a woman that come up and was convinced
[1:52:01] she had heart trouble i knew she didn't
[1:52:03] the holy spirit spoke to my heart and i
[1:52:05] just immediately told us it says there's
[1:52:06] nothing wrong with your heart as it's

[1:52:14] a blessing of god on you and she went
[1:52:16] away from there and it was gone like
[1:52:17] that
[1:52:18] you say what did you do to her all i did
[1:52:20] was give her the promises of god's word
[1:52:23] by his strengths by his wounds you are
[1:52:27] already healed
[1:52:30] you need deliverance tonight it's yours
[1:52:32] if you want it you need the holy ghost
[1:52:33] tonight it's yours if you want it
[1:52:38] god keeps his word
[1:52:47] now
[1:52:48] i'm going to tell you something
[1:52:50] you you can jump up and down all day
[1:52:52] long but if you're not sincere before
[1:52:53] god the devil knows that
[1:52:56] if you god gives you an opportunity he
[1:52:59] doesn't say you'll take it he says there
[1:53:00] has no temptation taken you but such as
[1:53:03] his common demand but within that god
[1:53:05] has made a way that you might escape it
[1:53:07] it doesn't say you will escape it he
[1:53:08] said you could
[1:53:10] i'll make a way for you to be up to you
[1:53:12] if you take it or not
[1:53:13] see i had i had a man come to me some
[1:53:16] years ago he's having terrible marital
[1:53:17] problems
[1:53:18] and and fell and and and said he had a
[1:53:20] dream that his wife was cheating on him
[1:53:23] and i said well
[1:53:25] you know i'd have to see the dream so
[1:53:26] let's pray
[1:53:27] and see if god will show me the dream
[1:53:29] and then we'll know what we'll know what
[1:53:31] his word is and dreams operate in my
[1:53:33] life and ministry i'm not a prophet at
[1:53:34] all and usually it's a prophet that has
[1:53:35] to do that but the holy ghost can use
[1:53:37] any gifts in any holy ghost filled
[1:53:39] believer
[1:53:40] and so i prayed and sure enough i saw
[1:53:42] the dream perfectly came back set him
[1:53:43] down in my office and i said there was
[1:53:45] this this this and he said yeah and i
[1:53:47] said you didn't tell me about this he
[1:53:48] goes oh i forgot about that i said now
[1:53:50] did you notice this certain detail about
[1:53:52] your wife
[1:53:53] do you remember this in the dream he
[1:53:54] goes
[1:53:55] yeah
[1:53:56] you're right that was true and i said
[1:53:58] see that proves it wasn't this and it
[1:54:00] proves it wasn't this it's not rebellion

[1:56:23] all closed their eyes and gathered in a
[1:56:24] circle when they opened their eyes he
[1:56:25] was gone and the little guy had rolled
[1:56:28] right between one of those legs rolled
[1:56:30] out the door and disappeared into the
[1:56:32] night into the jungle
[1:56:34] and all the deacons and everybody's
[1:56:36] running around with flashlights and the
[1:56:37] parents are screaming and brother the
[1:56:40] brother the pastor i won't call his name
[1:56:41] he just takes his flashlight and he said
[1:56:43] lord where's the child and the lord said
[1:56:45] go forward and he'll start walking
[1:56:47] forward i'm going to tell you the sons
[1:56:48] of god are led by the spirit of god and

[1:56:54] left now go some more now stop shine
[1:56:56] your light in that tree and shine it up
[1:56:58] and there's the child
[1:57:00] and they brought him down and took him
[1:57:01] back into the church and commanded the
[1:57:02] demon to come out of him and he stood on
[1:57:04] his feet like a normal child for the
[1:57:06] first time in years
[1:57:08] how how how had a man broad he wasn't
[1:57:10] even a believer had a man a man brought
[1:57:12] he was an idol worshiper and brought his
[1:57:14] wife
[1:57:15] into the church because this pastor has
[1:57:17] a has a reputation for casting out
[1:57:18] devils
[1:57:20] even the even the police come get him at
[1:57:22] two or three and four in the morning to
[1:57:23] go cast the devil out of a crazy person
[1:57:25] they can't handle
[1:57:28] and the woman come in
[1:57:30] and brother
[1:57:31] and the brother began to speak to her
[1:57:34] and she hit the floor and started
[1:57:35] writhing like a snake and hissing and
[1:57:38] she slithered up to him and tried to
[1:57:39] bite him but he said you can't touch me
[1:57:41] the power of jesus stops you and she got
[1:57:43] within inches and she couldn't go any
[1:57:45] further and she rolled around and
[1:57:47] screamed and cried and a man's voice
[1:57:49] started speaking out of her and said and
[1:57:52] this this couple had had she had been
[1:57:54] pregnant four or five times
[1:57:57] and every time she had a miscarriage
[1:57:59] and this demon started speaking out of
[1:58:01] her in a male voice and said i am the
[1:58:03] one because the pastor said who are you
[1:58:06] and he wouldn't want to say it in the
[1:58:07] name of jesus i command you who are you
[1:58:10] and he said i'm the one who has been
[1:58:11] eating the fetuses every time she
[1:58:14] conceives i eat the child
[1:58:16] and the pastor said you will come out of
[1:58:18] her and he said i won't come out of her
[1:58:19] and he said you will come and i asked
[1:58:21] him one time i said brother i said what
[1:58:24] what do you do if the devil won't come
[1:58:26] out he goes no this is not allowed
[1:58:37] i thought
[1:58:38] okay
[1:58:40] okay
[1:58:42] man said that's not allowed i guess
[1:58:43] that's not allowed
[1:58:45] okay devil is not allowed you're coming
[1:58:46] out and he commanded that devil to come
[1:58:49] out of her and it actually ended up
[1:58:50] being multiple devils cast every one of
[1:58:52] them out and a year later he sent me a
[1:58:54] picture the man gave his heart to jesus
[1:58:57] christ the woman gave her heart to
[1:58:58] christ and they were standing there
[1:59:00] dedicating a baby
[1:59:02] i'm here to tell you something friend
[1:59:04] god still moves for anyone who'll
[1:59:07] believe his word
[1:59:16] in fact it is later the pastor told me
[1:59:19] he told me that that actually the lord
[1:59:21] come to him the whole time cops were
[1:59:22] coming knocking on his door at three in
[1:59:24] the morning they'd take him out away
[1:59:25] from his family he'd cast demons out and
[1:59:26] come back home he said as soon as i
[1:59:28] entered my village all the dogs would
[1:59:29] start howling again as soon as i walked
[1:59:31] in the village because i knew demons
[1:59:32] were trying to follow me
[1:59:33] brother man talks about those things
[1:59:35] those things are real friends don't let
[1:59:36] anybody ever tell you a devil's not real
[1:59:39] don't let anybody ever tell you jesus
[1:59:41] isn't more real
[1:59:42] hallelujah
[1:59:45] and and and and finally the lord told
[1:59:47] him and said don't go anymore
[1:59:49] said tell those people to come to church
[1:59:51] and hear the word of god and repent and
[1:59:53] i'll heal them
[1:59:54] this ain't just a circus i'm not here
[1:59:56] just casting out devils for no reason
[1:59:57] and when the police came back he said
[1:59:59] you bring him to church sunday morning
[2:00:01] keep him in chains and bring him sunday
[2:00:02] morning and they'd bring him and he'd
[2:00:04] come in with chains and leave without
[2:00:06] them
[2:00:07] hallelujah oh i've seen it friends i've
[2:00:10] seen it i'm here to tell you i've seen

[2:00:23] when he gave his heart to the lord his
[2:00:24] own daddy tried to have him murdered

[2:00:30] sneaking waiting to kill him he would
[2:00:32] just stop the angel lord said they're
[2:00:33] hiding right there call him out and he
[2:00:35] would call him out and they'd come
[2:00:36] before him ready to kill him and say
[2:00:38] because you have agreed and coveted with
[2:00:40] my own dad to shed innocent blood every
[2:00:42] one of you will be dead in a year
[2:00:44] one man died within minutes another man
[2:00:46] died within months and another man died
[2:00:48] seven or eight months later
[2:00:50] one man tried tried to tried to strike
[2:00:53] him tried to strike the death blow on
[2:00:55] him and the holy spirit struck him first
[2:00:57] and he fell to his face and hit a rock
[2:00:59] busted all of his teeth out and ran off
[2:01:01] later till he died
[2:01:03] i'm here to tell you this is a serious
[2:01:05] god
[2:01:06] god is serious about his word he was he
[2:01:08] was walking by the john one time he was
[2:01:10] coming back through the village because
[2:01:11] his village had sent him out he was only
[2:01:13] 15 years old and they ostracized him
[2:01:16] sent him out of the village his dad was
[2:01:17] the king of the tribe
[2:01:18] and they sent him out to live and he was
[2:01:20] naked and hungry and he said one night
[2:01:22] he was walking back to his hideout and
[2:01:24] the holy spirit said stop right here and
[2:01:26] he stopped and he said there's assassins
[2:01:27] hiding and he said where are they lord
[2:01:29] he said there's one there in the bushes
[2:01:31] one over here behind a tree one over
[2:01:32] here and one back there and they're all
[2:01:34] waiting as soon as you go through the
[2:01:35] gauntlet they're going to wipe you out
[2:01:37] and he said what do i do he said just
[2:01:38] stand still and brother abraham told me
[2:01:40] all of a sudden

[2:01:44] want
[2:01:44] little missiles of light started flying
[2:01:46] over his head
[2:01:48] and blowing those guys up boom boom boom
[2:01:51] he said oh you never heard so much
[2:01:53] screaming men running screaming
[2:01:55] hollering he watched they ran down the
[2:01:56] village
[2:01:58] the light chased them beyond they ran
[2:01:59] past their homes into the jungles
[2:02:03] and god preserved his life to this very
[2:02:05] days a pastor is the largest church in
[2:02:07] uganda
[2:02:08] has 200 young people just young people
[2:02:11] has a jungle church it's impossible for
[2:02:13] him to have that many people with a
[2:02:14] jungle church but he has the largest
[2:02:16] church in all uganda and the power of
[2:02:18] god moves in him and and the people know
[2:02:20] it and respect him

[2:02:30] your life as well i was standing in the
[2:02:33] west coast of africa and there's a
[2:02:35] pastor there who went on to be with the
[2:02:36] lord just recently and when we got we
[2:02:38] got there me and some other brothers we
[2:02:40] found that he was under the influence of
[2:02:42] an evil spirit he's a very nice man but
[2:02:44] clearly he was under the influence of a
[2:02:46] lying prophecy spirit he'd given several
[2:02:49] prophecies they weren't true they hadn't
[2:02:50] come to pass and he wouldn't he wouldn't
[2:02:52] be corrected and we got there and he
[2:02:54] finally humbled himself and we put him
[2:02:56] in a circle and we gathered around him
[2:02:58] and started praying and i'll tell you
[2:02:59] something friends

[2:03:02] responsible to make you believe it i can
[2:03:03] only tell you what happened i was
[2:03:05] standing there with my eyes closed and
[2:03:07] my head bowed and suddenly i was looking
[2:03:09] at a demon spirit literally rising up
[2:03:12] out of this man and screaming
[2:03:16] as he went off and drifted off and that
[2:03:18] that pastor was set free right then and
[2:03:20] right there he stayed a faithful servant
[2:03:22] of god till the day god called him home
[2:03:24] just recently i'm here to tell you god
[2:03:27] still moves in his people

[2:10:21] by a demon of depression
[2:10:24] and and oppression
[2:10:26] and she lived every day
[2:10:29] in a very dark place
[2:10:32] very dark
[2:10:33] she couldn't see she
[2:10:36] as if she just lived in a basement
[2:10:39] and she'd go out in the sunshine and to
[2:10:41] her it was just gloom
[2:10:43] it didn't matter what blessings came her
[2:10:45] way didn't matter her family loved her
[2:10:48] her grandchildren loved her they would
[2:10:50] kiss on her like any grandchild would
[2:10:52] but she lived in darkness and she didn't
[2:10:54] know why
[2:10:55] she was constantly depressed constantly
[2:10:58] gloomed she couldn't escape it
[2:11:05] she had a dream
[2:11:08] and in the dream she was in a dark
[2:11:10] dungeon
[2:11:12] like a like a deep root cellar she said

[2:11:32] opened and she said i realized there was
[2:11:34] a spiral staircase
[2:11:36] that opened at a door and she said a
[2:11:38] little girl
[2:11:40] opened that door and looked at me
[2:11:42] because that's where that came on her
[2:11:46] and she ran to that staircase and ran up
[2:11:49] that spiral staircase and the little
[2:11:50] girl moved out of the way and she burst
[2:11:52] into the light and she woke up
