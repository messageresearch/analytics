[28:41] chapter
[28:42] 15 amen we just are certainly glad to be

[28:48] tonight and we uh we had such a
[28:50] wonderful time uh away there for about
[28:53] 12 days in Israel and haven't really had
[28:55] a time to really give a chance to give
[28:58] some of the testimony from that but the
[28:59] Lord all I can say is is that uh brother
[29:03] Jason dears is the best trip planner uh
[29:06] it's ever lived on on planet Earth um
[29:09] but let me just say this Jason Amar as
[29:11] good as he is couldn't have put that
[29:13] trip together God really um God really
[29:16] blessed it in a really special way and
[29:18] so we'll Lord willing maybe in the
[29:20] future give a chance to be able to share
[29:22] some things the Lord did for us while we
[29:24] were over there we seen his hand of
[29:26] Mercy protect prot in US saving our
[29:28] lives and keeping us from harm and uh
[29:31] and also just blessing us with his
[29:33] presence just had such a special time
[29:35] had to have got got a chance to have
[29:37] communion little communion service in
[29:39] the garden uh or in the garden tomb
[29:42] there uh where the tomb W that Jesus was
[29:45] put in just right outside of that where
[29:47] golgatha is so it was just a really
[29:49] special time took a trip uh took a boat
[29:52] right on the Sea of Galilee sounds
[29:54] really unbelievable and it really was so
[29:57] I would just say if you ever have the
[29:58] chance to go go it's uh really just a
[30:02] blessing 1 Corinthians chapter 15 I said
[30:05] that because I'm going to make just some
[30:07] comments about some things that we' seen
[30:09] there that just tie in with a sermon
[30:10] here tonight that we have I'm going to

[31:19] am in the father and the father in me or
[31:22] else believe me for the very Works sake
[31:25] in other words even if you don't

[34:44] tonight on Wednesday we ask it in Jesus
[34:46] Christ's name amen amen you can be
[34:55] seated
[35:02] we had such a good time and I I just uh
[35:05] won't take any much time to really um go
[35:08] over it and I don't there it is right
[35:09] there if you could go ahead and display
[35:11] that power you got it already up thank
[35:12] you we had such a wonderful
[35:15] time uh there in Israel and it was uh
[35:19] incredible to me so many things I could
[35:21] name uh to you and could give you
[35:24] reasons why it was incredible as we did
[35:27] um uh just going to turn these up
[35:28] brother B that's okay if it gets too
[35:30] loud then you can you can uh get mad at
[35:32] me later but I got to hear myself um we
[35:35] had seen so many incredible things there
[35:37] in Israel and uh I could give you a list
[35:40] as I said of of things that we've seen
[35:43] but you know for just tonight's sermon
[35:45] here in context of what we're preaching
[35:47] on the second Adam's children I just
[35:49] thought it was so profound just the
[35:52] simple realization while we were there
[35:55] uh very simple realiz ation struck me
[35:57] that my whole life I've read the Bible
[36:00] I've preached uh even uh about the the
[36:03] the characters of The Bible and I've
[36:05] preached about the men of the Bible and
[36:07] and uh and and I've read the Bible and
[36:09] heard the Bible preach my whole life but
[36:11] now I'm standing in the land of the
[36:14] Bible and I'm I'm standing in the
[36:16] promised land the place that God had
[36:18] promised to Abraham and to Isaac and to
[36:21] Jacob and I'd always wanted to see many
[36:23] things in my life there's bucket list
[36:25] that everybody I'm sure would make of
[36:27] things you'd want to see if you ever had
[36:29] a chance to go there and so I had a list
[36:32] of many things that I was praying that
[36:34] the Lord would allow us to see while we
[36:36] were there and the Lord granted almost
[36:38] every single nearly everything that I
[36:39] had on my heart the Lord just granted
[36:42] that in a special way and we were able
[36:43] to see it one of those places that I
[36:46] wanted to see for years uh after
[36:48] watching a a man who had went over there
[36:51] and did a video on his trip was the
[36:53] Israeli Museum I'm not much of a museum
[36:56] guide I'm not against museums in any way
[36:58] but just not my my kind of thing
[37:00] normally uh maybe would consider it
[37:02] boring and couldn't read you know so
[37:04] much and but this was totally different
[37:06] you know when you're when you're
[37:08] studying a student of the Bible and
[37:09] you're reading about this then this
[37:11] isn't just a a book it's not just a good
[37:13] novel it's not just a good story it's
[37:16] the story of my life everything that I
[37:18] my entire life is connected to it in
[37:20] some way and so we got to go over there
[37:22] to this uh Israeli Museum if you ever
[37:25] get a chance I just believe every
[37:26] believer should go and see that museum
[37:29] if you're ever there it's just would
[37:30] just be a a great encouragement to you
[37:33] but one of those places in the museum
[37:36] was an exhibit they call the Shrine of
[37:38] the book and uh it's pictured here just
[37:41] in this image and and this is just the
[37:44] cap of that uh of that place um and and
[37:48] and it's it's called The Shrine of the
[37:50] book because of what's inside of it
[37:52] there's actually an underground section
[37:54] that you go into and if you do a little
[37:56] a little bit of study you'll find out
[37:58] this is where they keep uh what's called
[38:00] the Aleppo codex and if you're not into
[38:02] manuscript the original Hebrew Bible
[38:04] that's okay I wasn't either until I
[38:06] needed to study on it but the Aleppo
[38:09] codex was part of the what they call the
[38:11] mastic text which was the the
[38:13] manuscripts of where we get our Hebrew
[38:16] Bible the mastic text was written about
[38:18] a th000 ad and it was until they
[38:21] discovered the Dead Sea Scrolls uh it
[38:23] was it was the most furthest back they
[38:26] could date the the Hebrew Bible the
[38:28] Tanakh the the the Old Testament the
[38:31] Psalms and all of the the the Proverbs
[38:33] and all the prophets and so that Hebrew
[38:36] Bible is that that Aleppo codex they
[38:38] keep that there uh in the Shrine of the
[38:41] book and they've made a great uh great
[38:43] uh exhibit there that you can see and
[38:45] read all about it um and then they they
[38:48] um uh they also keep the Dead Sea
[38:51] Scrolls there which are we're not
[38:53] preaching on any of this tonight just
[38:55] wanted to bring a thought from a little
[38:56] context from it here in our sermon but
[38:58] the Dead Sea uh the Dead Sea Scrolls
[39:01] that they found also uh are there in the
[39:04] Shrine of the book and that Dead Sea
[39:06] Scrolls is another compilation of just
[39:08] ancient books and ancient texts and in
[39:11] fact ancient manuscripts more ancient
[39:14] than the altic the mastic text that
[39:18] actually when they found the Dead Sea
[39:20] Scrolls what they realized was is that
[39:23] what they had been relying upon for the
[39:25] manuscript for the Hebrew Bible from a
[39:27] th000 ad matched up to text they had now
[39:31] found from all the way in the 3r century
[39:33] BC about 300 years before Christ and so
[39:37] these texts was a great discovery when
[39:39] they found the Dead Sea Scrolls in the
[39:41] caves of kumran and cuman's right along
[39:44] the shores of the the Dead Sea and it's
[39:46] just a little village that the that they
[39:49] that they had there the ases had and
[39:50] they took the Bible and lived a very
[39:52] dedicated it was a sectarian group just
[39:55] like the Pharisees and Sadducees
[39:57] um but they they they discovered these
[39:59] the Dead Sea Scrolls and and within that
[40:02] they found the entire book of Isaiah the
[40:05] entire Isaiah scroll and it just and it
[40:08] was it was incredible because it matched
[40:10] perfectly the Aleppo codec and all the
[40:13] manuscripts from a thousand years later
[40:15] and just from the to line upon line the
[40:18] God's word has been preserved and
[40:19] protected you listen because this wasn't
[40:21] a book written by a man it was breathed
[40:24] by
[40:25] God and know that the the Dead Sea
[40:27] Scrolls uh were were were discovered
[40:29] there and found in a village and it's
[40:31] amazing when you go down in the The
[40:33] Shrine of the book and you begin to see
[40:35] some of that some of the exhibit they
[40:38] have there on the Aleppo codex and also
[40:40] the Dead Sea and I begin to read an
[40:43] inscription and it was so incredible is
[40:46] because these Dead Sea Scrolls were
[40:48] found in
[40:50] 1947 about 3 months before Israel
[40:53] becomes a nation three months before
[40:57] they're voted in the UN and Israel
[40:59] becomes a nation that there's a bed a
[41:02] ban Shepherd uh if you don't know the
[41:05] BET one's just a very H H uh indigenous
[41:08] group there that very um uh but anyways
[41:11] not I don't want to get sidetracked on
[41:12] that here tonight but these Benn
[41:14] Shepherds had had tried to find their
[41:16] goat and they had thrown a stone inside
[41:18] of a caved and heard something break
[41:20] some pottery break they go in to
[41:22] discover and these Shepherds found the
[41:24] Dead Sea Scrolls and here they find one
[41:27] of the greatest discoveries they didn't
[41:28] even know what they had when they found
[41:30] it they had no clue they just thought it
[41:32] was just another Hebrew text something
[41:33] ancient something that was old they
[41:36] actually they sold it to a man who just
[41:38] told him it was ancient text that man
[41:40] didn't really know what it was he sent
[41:42] it to uh New York City and they put it
[41:44] actually you can find a classified
[41:46] section in the in the uh the newspaper
[41:49] in New York City trying to sell these
[41:52] books and it just says Ancient Man
[41:55] ancient books uh old books come get your
[41:57] taste of the old life and little do they
[42:00] know it's the most ancient accurate
[42:02] manuscript you know friends sometimes
[42:04] you don't realize what you have in your
[42:06] hand until a the revelation of the
[42:09] prophet of God tells you what you have
[42:11] in your hand little David might just
[42:12] look like a stone but it's what's going
[42:14] to slay Goliath might not look like much
[42:17] but to the to th to that man it just
[42:19] could be solded on the street for
[42:20] nothing but it was the very breathed
[42:23] word of God on paper corre
[42:27] and so these bet when Shepherds sell it
[42:28] they finally find out years later and so
[42:31] they they discover this in in in
[42:33] 1947 and it was so incredible to me
[42:36] because uh they believe that the the
[42:39] Jews believe that this signified
[42:41] something that it wasn't just an
[42:43] accident that these Shepherds found
[42:45] these Scrolls but actually they believe
[42:48] that it fulfilled Isaiah chapter 2:3 and
[42:52] in Isaiah 2:3 and you don't have to turn
[42:54] I'm just going to read it it says and
[42:56] many people shall go and say Come Ye and
[42:59] let us go up to the mountain of the Lord
[43:01] to the house of God of to the god of
[43:03] Jacob and he will teach us his ways and
[43:06] we will walk in his paths notice for out
[43:10] of Zion shall go forth the law and the
[43:13] word of the Lord from Jerusalem so the
[43:17] Jews see the Dead Sea Scrolls and I
[43:20] absolutely do believe it wasn't an
[43:21] accident that three months before Israel
[43:25] becomes a
[43:26] and God is going to fulfill prophecy by
[43:29] taking people from the land the people
[43:31] of the land to bring them back to the
[43:33] land to take the land that right before
[43:36] God puts the people back in the Homeland
[43:39] he restores the word to the people my
[43:41] brother my sister I hope you're a
[43:43] Believer here tonight and catch the
[43:44] significance in 1947 we have the tape of
[43:48] God's Prophet saying they're getting
[43:49] some gadgets together for recording at
[43:52] the time God was restoring the word to
[43:54] Israel God was restoring in the word to
[43:57] a gentile bride I I say thank God for
[44:00] what you've did in this generation thank
[44:02] God that I'm a recipient of that word
[44:04] that was restored I don't just read
[44:06] about a book but I am the person of the
[44:09] book I am who the book is written about
[44:11] and I've receive the word of the book
[44:13] and it's my homeland it's my Promised
[44:17] Land Hallelujah can you say Amen do you
[44:19] believe that tonight and so the timing
[44:22] of God is just perfect let me say it
[44:24] this way we have returned to the land of
[44:27] Abraham Isaac and Jacob we have returned
[44:30] to the coming of the Lord it was it was
[44:32] the co it was the more than that let me
[44:35] say this more than that we have returned
[44:37] to the land of the Bible this Bible is
[44:40] your inheritance the song says every
[44:43] promise in the book is mine every
[44:45] chapter every verse and every line you
[44:47] say what part of it's yours brother Matt
[44:49] every part that God intended for to be
[44:52] applicable to me I say God I want all of
[44:54] it I don't want to I don't want to be
[44:56] withheld from any of it Lord but I want
[44:58] to be a recipient of all of it can you
[45:00] say Amen to the word of God and so it's
[45:02] a land that that that Paul defines the
[45:05] borders of this land let me say it this
[45:08] way it's our
[45:10] land it's our land it's your land young
[45:13] people tonight it's your promise it's
[45:16] your inheritance tonight whatsoever
[45:19] Jesus said you ask I shall do what does
[45:22] that mean it means that anything that
[45:24] you say and anything that you ask in my
[45:26] name anything that you ask according to
[45:29] my word you're the CH you're the child
[45:31] you're you're you're the second Adam's
[45:33] children and every promise in the book
[45:36] is yours Hallelujah and so the I I I
[45:39] thought of this this was so amazing
[45:41] while walking uh in the land of Israel
[45:44] it's one thing to have a land but it
[45:47] takes a people of the land it takes a
[45:49] person to dwell and inhabit listen God
[45:52] didn't just create that land to be a
[45:53] land flowing with milk and honey but he
[45:55] put put the land there for the people to
[45:57] possess that land he put that milk and
[45:59] honey for somebody to go and take part
[46:01] of it not just to say it's a land
[46:03] flowing with milk and honey but for
[46:05] somebody to say I'm going to take the
[46:06] milk and honey I'm going to take the
[46:08] sword of faith and take the sword of the
[46:11] word and I'm going to drive it and
[46:12] charge the enemy until I take what God
[46:15] has given me and take back what the
[46:17] devil has taken from me I'm going to
[46:19] take my inheritance because I'm a people
[46:21] of the
[46:23] land it's a land flowing with milk and
[46:25] honey as the brother said he said but it
[46:27] takes an eye of Faith to see it and it
[46:30] takes a hand of Faith to draw the honey
[46:32] from The Rock and so with the returning
[46:35] of go with with that returning God was
[46:38] going to return the word to them and so
[46:41] now after 2,000 years God has not just
[46:45] returned the book uh to the Jews but God
[46:48] has returned an open book to the Gentile
[46:51] church and God's people have heard their
[46:54] Jubilee the trumpet of Jubilee has
[46:57] already sounded if you're waiting for it
[46:59] I got news the Jubilee has already
[47:02] sounded you can go free you don't have
[47:05] to be bound from any cigarettes you
[47:06] don't have to be bound on any nicotine
[47:09] you don't have to be B bound to
[47:10] pornography you don't have to be bound
[47:12] to jealousy you don't have to be bound
[47:13] to anger or temper or Pride but the
[47:16] Jubilee has sounded and you can go free
[47:19] from anything the devil puts upon you oh
[47:21] I believe that God's people are free we
[47:24] ought to start living more like we're
[47:26] free and not bound uh listen friends
[47:28] we're not slaves to any denominational
[47:30] system we're not slaves to a teaching or
[47:33] a or a preaching or or an idea or a code
[47:35] or something but God's family is free in
[47:38] Christ Jesus she not slaves anymore
[47:41] she's free in the Lord Jesus and so
[47:44] notice this here uh he it's it was the
[47:47] returning of the book I just reading
[47:50] from my notes here just for a moment uh
[47:52] that they have that that that Jubilee
[47:54] has sounded and they were returning to
[47:56] the land of their inheritance something
[47:59] that God had promised them though it
[48:01] looked like it was impossible but God
[48:03] made a promise I'll bring you back to
[48:05] that land it didn't look like that when
[48:07] Hitler was and they were there in the
[48:09] Holocaust and millions of Jews were
[48:11] being slaughtered it didn't look like
[48:13] that God's word was was ever going to
[48:15] come to pass but in the right time in
[48:18] the right season under the right
[48:19] anointing in the right hour at the right
[48:22] moment nothing will stop God's word from
[48:25] coming to pass I said at the right
[48:27] moment at the right season no devil in
[48:30] hell can stop the word of God from
[48:32] coming to pass uh the Bible says the
[48:34] though the vision T be assured it will
[48:37] come to pass amen and so we're living
[48:40] how many believes that we're living
[48:42] could could you say Amen to this we're
[48:44] living in the end
[48:45] times could you say Amen to this that we
[48:48] are the people of the end times I'm
[48:51] asking can you say Amen so I'm just
[48:53] hoping that maybe you can if you don't
[48:55] say Amen maybe you can't so I'll ask
[48:56] again give you a second chance how many
[48:58] would say Amen to this we are living in
[49:00] the end times we are the people of the
[49:04] end times and so we've received an end
[49:07] time if there was an end time people
[49:09] there had to be an end time message if
[49:11] there was going to be an end time
[49:12] message there had to come an end time
[49:15] messenger and so there would be an end
[49:17] time message delivered by an end time
[49:19] profet I got a lot of hay on my Fork so
[49:21] I'm just going to go fast and I won't
[49:23] get to it and that's okay I'm not going
[49:25] to try to I heard brother Josh Bennett
[49:27] say this weekend I'm not a long-winded
[49:30] preacher it just depends on who you
[49:32] compare me
[49:34] to so don't compare me to anybody just
[49:37] except maybe brother Tim puit you
[49:39] compare me to brother Tim and I'm not
[49:41] that long of winded of a Preacher hope
[49:43] you don't hear
[49:44] that so we are living in the end time
[49:47] we're a people of the end time we've
[49:50] received an end time message and in fact
[49:52] there's an end time anointing that comes
[49:55] upon that message let me say this to you
[49:57] friends you don't have the anointing of
[49:59] the ox brother Ram was asking questions
[50:00] and answers 1964 will the bride go
[50:03] through the persecution as the first
[50:05] church did no brother the next thing for
[50:07] the church is the rapture and so there's
[50:10] not an ox anointing coming to give our
[50:12] lives you're not also not under the man
[50:14] anointing there was an anointing of men
[50:16] that God create Anointed The Mind the
[50:19] intellectual mind of man but let me just
[50:21] say that's not your anointing because
[50:23] that's not the spirit that fa you that's
[50:26] not the challenge of the day you say
[50:28] brother matth what is the challenge of
[50:30] the day the prophet of God said it was a
[50:32] p horse rider which was a mixture or a
[50:35] compilation of all of the horses of all
[50:37] of the Demons of all of the spirits I
[50:40] just heard brother Adam say it yesterday
[50:42] he said now more than ever before this
[50:44] the spirit of antichrist is more at work
[50:47] and it will continue to get worse and
[50:50] worse and worse until the Rapture of the
[50:53] Church of God had G so bad the Bible
[50:55] says says that if it wasn't for God
[50:57] cutting the cutting the time short even
[50:59] the elect wouldn't be saved but thank
[51:01] God I'm in God's hands thank God I'm in
[51:04] Jehovah's hands thank God I'm not in
[51:06] Putin's hands or Biden's hands or
[51:09] Trump's hands or a political party but
[51:11] my my life as David said is in the hands
[51:14] of God God says when my life is over no
[51:17] devil can take you brother brandham said
[51:19] until God is finished with you Satan
[51:21] can't even touch your
[51:23] life take that devil amen and so so so
[51:27] we've received that end time message
[51:29] with that end time anointing let me say
[51:32] my brother my sister it wasn't an
[51:33] anointing or a message just to give you
[51:35] mystery
[51:36] truths the mystery truths are wonderful
[51:39] but let me tell you who the mystery real
[51:41] mystery truth is
[51:43] you do you realize the real mystery was
[51:47] the manifestations of Sons and Daughters
[51:49] of God you have the mystery of the
[51:51] serpent SE we have the mystery of
[51:53] predestination The Mystery of the god
[51:55] had all of these Mysteries point to one
[51:57] thing that that Christ was the the as we
[52:01] know Christ was the mystery of God
[52:04] revealed so his bride would be the
[52:07] mystery of Christ
[52:10] revealed and so brother Bron ministers
[52:12] an entire series and he calls it Israel
[52:15] and the church how many have heard that
[52:17] how many have heard that Israel in the
[52:18] church and and it's a wonderful series
[52:21] he takes that series and title over and
[52:23] over actually again he takes that same
[52:25] sermon Israel in the church and what
[52:27] he's doing is is he's paralleling uh
[52:30] Israel and he says he's paralleling
[52:33] natural Israel to spiritual Israel now
[52:35] we haven't replaced Israel as
[52:37] replacement theolog theology would try
[52:40] to say that Israel you know spurn their
[52:42] chance and now the church the Gentile
[52:44] Church replaces them no no no but the
[52:46] Bible says that Israel's blindness was
[52:48] in part so that the Gentiles could come
[52:50] in so why was Israel blinded because you
[52:53] had to come to your season and your time
[52:54] recog recognize your day and its message
[52:57] because why brother Matt because your
[52:59] name was written in the Lamb's Book of
[53:00] Life before the foundation of the world
[53:03] before you ever came into existence my
[53:06] name was already written in a
[53:08] book that's why I had to hear the word
[53:11] that's why I had to recognize as his
[53:13] Eagle food that's why I can believe the
[53:15] message over the hour not because of
[53:17] anything that I'm better than anybody
[53:18] else but because my name was written in
[53:21] a
[53:22] book that's why the prophet says when
[53:25] you recognize this as Eagle's food you
[53:28] left the other thing and you heard from
[53:31] your theophany you say brother Matt you
[53:33] believe that you've heard from your
[53:35] theophany when you heard the message I
[53:36] do in fact I believe I hear from my
[53:38] theophany every time I read it every
[53:40] time I turn on a tape every time I hear
[53:42] the preaching of the word of God every
[53:44] time I'm in my prayer closet what am I
[53:46] doing I'm hearing from my representation
[53:49] in another dimension and I'm saying Amen
[53:51] to the word of God I feel like quitting
[53:53] but my theophany says don't quit you're
[53:56] not a quitter I feel like turning around
[53:58] but my theophany says you're not going
[54:00] to turn around you're going to make it
[54:02] all the way Hallelujah I feel like a
[54:04] failure sometimes that I miss God but my
[54:07] theophany says you're more than an
[54:09] overcomer in Christ
[54:11] Jesus
[54:14] Hallelujah so we're the children of
[54:17] Abraham and it parallels the natural
[54:19] seed Abraham with the Royal seed there's
[54:21] not just a natural there's a royal Seed
[54:24] of Abraham the children of Abraham are
[54:27] the faith the Royal seed are the faith
[54:29] seed brother Brandon would say by what
[54:31] brother Matt by the baptism of the Holy
[54:33] Ghost you become an heir of the promise
[54:36] of
[54:38] Abraham I'll say that again by the
[54:40] baptism of the Holy Ghost you become an
[54:43] heir of the same promise of the same
[54:45] land of the same
[54:48] blessing you realize what you have when
[54:50] you get the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[54:52] you take off this coat brother bam says
[54:54] listen it's not just a taking a Cod and
[54:56] putting another coat on a man and he
[54:58] says I'm afraid sometimes that's what
[55:00] religion is became we just take off an
[55:02] old coat and put on a new coat but the
[55:04] problem is is the man in the coat hasn't
[55:06] been changed I say what we need is not a
[55:08] new coat not a new dress code not a new
[55:10] idea we need new men in the coat we need
[55:14] Chang lives by the power of the
[55:16] preaching of the word of
[55:18] God and so he he the children of Abraham
[55:22] are the children of faith that Faith
[55:24] seed and so what God was going to do
[55:27] with natural Israel he was also going to
[55:30] do with spiritual Israel it's not an
[55:33] accident as we said that in 47 they find
[55:35] the Dead Sea Scrolls only three months
[55:37] before they become a nation and in the
[55:39] same year God's calling and starting to
[55:42] record by Magnetic Tape the voice of God
[55:45] through a Earthly Messenger to a to a to
[55:47] a people who could receive that message
[55:50] amen
[55:52] hallelujah so just as the figure fig
[55:55] tree what would would represent Israel
[55:58] Jesus says when you see the Fig Tree
[56:00] putting forth its bud you putting forth
[56:02] its Branch you know that the time is not
[56:03] so brother bam said what did that fig
[56:05] tree represent it represented Israel you
[56:07] don't represent the Fig Tree but the Fig
[56:10] Tree represents Israel but in also not
[56:13] just there isn't just a fig tree there's
[56:15] also a bride tree and that brid tree
[56:17] just as the Fig Tree would put forth a
[56:19] branch that brid tree would come through
[56:22] the Dark Ages through a Reformation
[56:24] through Luther through Wesley all the
[56:26] way through Pentecost all the way to
[56:28] where at the seed that fell in the
[56:29] ground becomes the seed at the end
[56:32] time and so so there there was a there
[56:35] was a there was a a a fig tree putting
[56:38] forth its Branch so the bride tree has
[56:41] borne a new Branch can you say Amen
[56:45] struggling on where to go here just pray
[56:47] for me just for a moment just want to uh
[56:50] want to make this want to make sure we
[56:52] turn the right corner and we don't go uh
[56:54] with the amount of time that we have
[56:56] here tonight uh 1 Peter chapter 3 if you
[56:59] have your Bible we'll just turn to the
[57:00] to 1 Peter chapter 3 quickly if you
[57:03] could if they can just keep my
[57:04] PowerPoint up rather than putting the
[57:06] scripture up that'd probably be better 1
[57:08] Peter chapter 3 we're just going to read
[57:10] from verse 14 through Verse 18 and so
[57:14] notice this here uh 1 Peter chapter 3
[57:17] but and you he says and if you suffer
[57:19] for righteousness sake happy are you and
[57:21] be not afraid of their Terror neither be
[57:24] troubled but sanctify the Lord God in
[57:27] your hearts now I want to tell you what
[57:30] the what this is really saying he's
[57:33] saying make the Lord make God the
[57:39] Lord in your heart amen let's read it
[57:43] again together but
[57:46] sanctify the Lord God in your heart in
[57:50] other words make him the Lord of your
[57:54] heart amen obey his voice come under the
[57:59] headship of the
[58:01] Lord this is what he's saying here in
[58:04] verse 15 sanctify the Lord God in your
[58:08] heart brother random says this here in
[58:10] the seventh seal he says I went to a man
[58:12] not long ago he come to me rather he'd
[58:14] been arguing all around everywhere
[58:16] against Divine Healing and he'd come up
[58:18] and he said I don't believe your Divine
[58:20] Healing I said my I guess it wouldn't be
[58:22] any good cuz I ain't got any
[58:25] I said ' but God is perfect he said
[58:28] there's no such a thing I said you're
[58:29] too late to say that buddy you done
[58:32] waited too long for that you might have
[58:34] argued a few years ago but there's
[58:36] another age on now there's Millions to
[58:39] testify see I said you're too late now
[58:42] fella to say that he said well he
[58:47] said he said well I don't believe I
[58:50] don't care what you do I said certainly
[58:52] not you can't now I want I want you to
[58:55] notice here because I'm just going to
[58:57] take just a turn here in 1 Peter chapter
[58:59] 3 and I'm going to pause that come back
[59:01] to the slide he says here in verse 15
[59:03] keep reading in your Bible but sanctify
[59:06] the Lord God in your hearts and be ready
[59:10] always to give an answer to every man
[59:13] that askthe a reason of the hope that is
[59:16] with he says of the hope that is in you
[59:19] with meekness and fear having a good
[59:22] conscience that whereas they speak evil
[59:24] of you as as of evildoers they may be
[59:27] ashamed that falsely accuse your good
[59:29] accuse your good conversation in Christ
[59:31] for it is better if the will of God be
[59:33] so then you that you suffer for
[59:35] well-doing than for evildoing I want to
[59:37] key in on this verse here because I just
[59:40] want to preach to you something the I'm
[59:42] preaching on second Adam's children but
[59:44] the Lord just so inspired this to my
[59:46] heart here in 1 Peter chapter 3 because
[59:49] you can almost get the idea from this
[59:52] verse 15 that this means that we've got
[59:55] to give an answer to every
[59:59] question forgive me just got clogged up
[1:00:02] here in my thr in my in my voice it may
[1:00:05] it would almost mean that come off to
[1:00:07] mean that we've got to give an answer to
[1:00:09] every question but let me just go ahead
[1:00:11] and cut to the chase you don't need to
[1:00:14] give an answer to every
[1:00:16] question this is not what First Peter
[1:00:19] chapter 3 is saying now this is what the
[1:00:22] modern Church thinks that you have to be
[1:00:24] ready to give an answer to any critic or
[1:00:28] any skeptic or any person that gives you
[1:00:30] an answer that you've got to argue with
[1:00:33] them and prove and defend the gospel now
[1:00:36] I'm all for defending the gospel but we
[1:00:38] don't defend the gospel by
[1:00:42] arguing the second Adam's children don't
[1:00:45] defend the gospel by arguing the gospel
[1:00:48] listen to what brother Bram says here he
[1:00:50] says he says he said well I don't
[1:00:52] believe you certainly not he says you
[1:00:54] can't
[1:00:55] see he said smite me blind if you got
[1:00:59] the Holy Ghost like Paul smite me blind
[1:01:02] I said how can I do it when you're
[1:01:04] already
[1:01:07] blind your father has blinded you to the
[1:01:12] truth and I said you're already
[1:01:15] blind and he said I wouldn't believe I
[1:01:17] don't care what you could do how much
[1:01:19] evidence you could prove or anything
[1:01:20] like that I still don't believe I said
[1:01:22] certainly it wasn't for
[1:01:26] unbelievers it was only for
[1:01:30] believers can we go a little further
[1:01:32] what was it you know right when they
[1:01:35] then the elections off notice what he
[1:01:37] says here see you know right then the
[1:01:40] elections off just don't fool with it at
[1:01:44] all Jesus did the same thing he said let
[1:01:47] them alone if the blind lead the blind
[1:01:49] won't they all fall in the ditch but
[1:01:51] when he come to a little prostitute it
[1:01:53] struck fire GL what was it brother bam
[1:01:57] says if Jesus said the blind lead the
[1:01:59] blind they all fall in the ditch but
[1:02:00] when it come to a little prostitute it
[1:02:02] struck fire what was it it was an
[1:02:05] elected seed laying down there that's
[1:02:08] seen it right now when it come to Peter
[1:02:10] there was an elected seed lay in there
[1:02:12] see and they saw it and all the father
[1:02:16] hath give notice past
[1:02:18] tense all the father hath already given
[1:02:24] past
[1:02:25] tense this is why brother randam says if
[1:02:27] you are God's child you always were
[1:02:30] God's child and he says then if you aren
[1:02:33] a Son of God you can never be a Son of
[1:02:35] God no matter how much you try you can
[1:02:38] never be one and he says because all
[1:02:40] that the father hath given me in other
[1:02:42] words brother bandam says if you are
[1:02:44] Gods you always were
[1:02:49] Gods you only bypassed your theophany
[1:02:52] and came to this world to be tested in
[1:02:54] tried but when you heard that word it
[1:02:57] struck fire down inside of your heart
[1:02:59] you didn't question it you didn't argue
[1:03:01] it you didn't debate it you didn't even
[1:03:03] need to put on a chalkboard but
[1:03:05] something inside of you said amen I
[1:03:08] believe that word I accept that word I
[1:03:11] hear that word something inside of me
[1:03:14] identifies with that
[1:03:16] word when it come to Peter there was an
[1:03:18] elected seed laying there and they saw
[1:03:21] it all the father hath given me hath
[1:03:24] come brother bandam says if you weren't
[1:03:25] Gods you never can be but if you were
[1:03:28] Gods you always will be and nothing can
[1:03:31] ever make you not a son or daughter of
[1:03:34] God oh Hallelujah is right I say thank
[1:03:38] God thank God that nothing I can do can
[1:03:40] ever separate me from being a son or
[1:03:43] daughter of God because I've done many
[1:03:45] things how many would be honest here and
[1:03:47] say I've done many things in my life
[1:03:49] that would have written me off and
[1:03:51] marked me off and disqualified me but
[1:03:54] the grace of God said I'm his and he is
[1:03:58] mine and nothing can separate me from
[1:04:00] the love that's in Christ
[1:04:02] Jesus
[1:04:04] Hallelujah Brother Band says though come
[1:04:06] to me oh my I love that yes sir notice
[1:04:10] the Believers does believe it the
[1:04:13] unbelievers
[1:04:15] can't believe it amen if anybody wants
[1:04:18] to argue about the serpent seed and
[1:04:20] things and you try to show them they
[1:04:22] won't listen to it just walk
[1:04:27] away amen how many Believers can say
[1:04:29] Amen to the word of God listen friends
[1:04:32] say Amen if you believe if you don't
[1:04:34] then I think that I get scared as
[1:04:35] brother brandham says they said oh you
[1:04:37] saying amen might make me scared brother
[1:04:38] Bram says if you not saying am man would
[1:04:40] make me
[1:04:41] scared when you don't amen the word I
[1:04:44] just assume you don't believe
[1:04:47] it I mean that when you don't amen the
[1:04:50] word I question do you believe it or not
[1:04:51] cuz a Believer believes the word and
[1:04:53] says Amen to the word word of God I
[1:04:55] heard a preacher sent it to the entire
[1:04:57] men's group here heard a preacher a uh a
[1:05:00] Missionary Baptist preacher did you get
[1:05:02] that brother Joe I don't know if you you
[1:05:03] heard that yeah Missionary Baptist
[1:05:06] preacher uh preaching on here's a man
[1:05:08] doesn't have any revelation of the word
[1:05:09] of God of the message of the hour and
[1:05:11] he's and and this man's up here
[1:05:12] preaching on the way of balum how many
[1:05:14] brothers raise your hand if you heard
[1:05:15] that raise your hand if you heard it if
[1:05:17] you didn't hear it I want to make sure I
[1:05:18] get it to you CU it's really good you go
[1:05:20] in the bethl men chat you'll get that
[1:05:22] video we sent out here's a man preaching
[1:05:24] his heart out against the way of Balon
[1:05:27] and against the modern Church Hillsong
[1:05:29] and and Steven fdick starts calling out
[1:05:31] names and bethl church and Jesus
[1:05:33] Revolution and asbe Revival and he's
[1:05:35] starting to show that it might look like
[1:05:37] the word it might look like the gospel
[1:05:40] it might sound like the gospel but it
[1:05:42] denies the power thereof and it's the
[1:05:44] way of balum and you know what I heard I
[1:05:46] heard the echoing voices thundering of
[1:05:49] hundreds of missionary baptist people
[1:05:52] saying Amen to the word of God I thought
[1:05:54] oh God help us if we've gotten to a
[1:05:56] place where when the preaching of the
[1:05:58] word of God comes God help us if we
[1:06:00] can't say amen I say we ought to give a
[1:06:03] hearty amen if you ever feel like
[1:06:05] standing up to your feet you ought to
[1:06:06] stand to your feet to say I support the
[1:06:08] word of God I'm identified with the word
[1:06:11] of God I'm not afraid to say Amen to the
[1:06:13] word of God you ought to support
[1:06:17] it it helps not me it helps the Holy
[1:06:22] Spirit brother bam said helps accumulate
[1:06:25] faith I want to accumulate faith brother
[1:06:29] bam says if they won't listen notice
[1:06:31] this then just walk away leave them
[1:06:34] alone see God don't argue neither does
[1:06:39] his children amen amen so there's this
[1:06:44] this thinking listen I'm just going to
[1:06:45] preach here just for a moment I'm
[1:06:47] already preaching but I I got to say
[1:06:48] that cuz what I'm about to say we don't
[1:06:51] need to research this messag amen amen
[1:06:54] amen you don't need to why would you
[1:06:57] research it you to vindicate it it's
[1:06:59] already been
[1:07:01] Vindicated we're not looking for more
[1:07:03] Vindication it's already been Vindicated
[1:07:06] no more than I don't need to read y
[1:07:08] brother Matt you better be careful
[1:07:09] listen friends I I will be careful I
[1:07:12] don't need to research this
[1:07:16] Bible I don't need to research the
[1:07:18] message the same reason I don't need to
[1:07:20] research the Bible why it's already been
[1:07:23] Vindicated amen you don't need to answer
[1:07:26] the questions of unbelievers why brother
[1:07:28] Matt because it's unbelievers
[1:07:31] questions let me just say this and make
[1:07:33] this real simple those are unbelievers
[1:07:35] questions those aren't your questions
[1:07:37] that's right amen they're not our
[1:07:40] questions so don't try to answer them of
[1:07:43] unbelievers because why brother Matt
[1:07:45] they're not asked from a position of
[1:07:47] Revelation they're asked from a position
[1:07:50] of skepticism and
[1:07:52] unbelief amen
[1:07:54] and the same spirit that anoints the
[1:07:56] defectors of the message to try to get
[1:07:58] you to tangle with him and questions is
[1:08:00] the Same Spirit on Charles Darwin it's
[1:08:02] the same Spirit on on the atheist
[1:08:05] movement that tries to get you to get
[1:08:06] down into the into the text and try to
[1:08:08] bring you down into an intellectual
[1:08:10] level listen friends our battle is not
[1:08:12] with flesh and blood it's with
[1:08:14] principalities and powers and wickedness
[1:08:16] and evil places and the weapons of our
[1:08:19] Warfare are not carnal but they're
[1:08:21] spiritual to the pulling down of
[1:08:23] stronghold
[1:08:25] we don't wrestle Flesh and
[1:08:31] Blood I don't need to answer the
[1:08:33] questions of
[1:08:35] atheists because they're not my
[1:08:39] questions and I don't need to answer the
[1:08:41] me the the the the doubters of the
[1:08:43] detractors and defectors of the message
[1:08:45] of the hour and try to make brother
[1:08:46] brandham say that he was dishonest say
[1:08:48] that he was a liar say that he was a
[1:08:50] false prophet don't you realize they
[1:08:51] said that about every true prophet of
[1:08:53] God
[1:08:54] in fact they went worse than that and
[1:08:55] cut their heads off hung them on upside
[1:08:58] down on crosses they hated Jesus Jesus
[1:09:01] said if they hate listen friends I'd be
[1:09:03] more scared if the whole world accepted
[1:09:05] what we
[1:09:07] preach I said I'd be worried about what
[1:09:09] we're preaching if our the entire world
[1:09:12] and masses came in here and filled up
[1:09:14] our churches without any transformed
[1:09:17] life if if our people can sit here with
[1:09:20] cut hair makeup earrings pants on women
[1:09:23] shorts on men and and if you can sit and
[1:09:25] come to bethl Tabernacle for month after
[1:09:27] month after month then I've got to ask
[1:09:30] what is h what's
[1:09:32] wrong as people just doing
[1:09:36] this when when when the preaching of the
[1:09:38] word of God is
[1:09:40] preached it's a perversion of scripture
[1:09:43] let me just say this it's a perversion
[1:09:45] of scripture in First Peter chapter 3 to
[1:09:48] say we have to have an answer to every
[1:09:51] man that ask that is not what first
[1:09:54] Peter 3 is saying but it's been hijacked
[1:09:58] by the modern church with a modern
[1:10:00] agenda and it's been used as the gateway
[1:10:03] to
[1:10:06] apostasy now that was straight from the
[1:10:08] Holy Spirit and I just wrote it down I'm
[1:10:11] going to tell you say brother mat then
[1:10:12] what does it mean to give an answer to
[1:10:14] every man about the hope that layeth
[1:10:17] within him doesn't the Bible say study
[1:10:19] to show yourself approved a Workman who
[1:10:21] needeth not be ashamed I I absolutely
[1:10:24] believed in studying the word of God I
[1:10:25] believe in rightly dividing the word of
[1:10:27] God I believe in being able to tell
[1:10:29] somebody about what I believe I believe
[1:10:31] in studying the
[1:10:33] message but let me just say it again
[1:10:36] it's a perversion to say that first
[1:10:38] Peter 3 is saying that we've got to give
[1:10:40] an answer to every question to the
[1:10:43] skeptic you are wasting your time and I
[1:10:47] would be wasting my time and their time
[1:10:49] to debate
[1:10:52] them
[1:10:54] you say why brother Matt because that's
[1:10:56] not what the Bible teaches and listen
[1:10:58] let me go a little bit further here and
[1:11:00] we're just going to take a take a pause
[1:11:02] from that listen to what brother
[1:11:02] brandham says here and he says oh and he
[1:11:05] says he says the prophet Paul said in
[1:11:07] the last day people would be headyy oh
[1:11:10] my goodness how many could say we've
[1:11:11] seen that high-m minded lovers of
[1:11:14] pleasure more than lovers of God truce
[1:11:18] Breakers false accusers incontinent that
[1:11:21] means they have no self control
[1:11:24] despisers of those that are good he High
[1:11:28] minded see having a form of
[1:11:32] godliness but denying the power thereof
[1:11:36] from such
[1:11:40] debate from such sit down in a Facebook
[1:11:44] interview and argue with them sit down
[1:11:46] in a podcast with them and argue is that
[1:11:48] what your Bible says I ain't preaching
[1:11:50] against anybody or anything so don't
[1:11:51] even get that in your mind
[1:11:54] but the Bible says from such turn
[1:12:01] away for this is the kind that goes from
[1:12:03] house to house and leads silly women LED
[1:12:06] away with diverse lust with shorts
[1:12:08] bobbed hair and everything else LED away
[1:12:11] with diverse lust and saying it's all
[1:12:13] right oh they're crazy out there don't
[1:12:16] pay no attention see never able to come
[1:12:19] to the knowledge of the truth and these
[1:12:22] men resisted as Janice and Jam's with
[1:12:25] stood Moses able to produce a church
[1:12:27] able to produce a group of people but
[1:12:29] their Folly will be made
[1:12:34] manifest I know when it's going to be
[1:12:36] brother Matt when I argue with him and I
[1:12:38] can prove them make them look dumb no
[1:12:39] they'll end up making you look
[1:12:43] dumb because that's not your
[1:12:46] anointing and listen Eve when you get
[1:12:48] out from behind the word you get out
[1:12:50] from behind your headship and when you
[1:12:52] get out from behind your headship you
[1:12:54] remove yourself from your
[1:12:56] protection their Folly will be made
[1:13:00] known listen what brother bom says here
[1:13:02] make sure I didn't I didn't skip it when
[1:13:04] the church allowed herself to move away
[1:13:06] from the original like Adam and Eve
[1:13:08] death said in there's no strength in her
[1:13:12] she has become a monstrosity the minute
[1:13:15] the church moved toward form and
[1:13:19] ceremony and priesthood by organizing
[1:13:21] the ministers into a group that decided
[1:13:24] leadership apart from the Holy Spirit
[1:13:26] and his word that very
[1:13:29] moment death entered and she started to
[1:13:32] get
[1:13:33] sick now he's preaching to you on the
[1:13:35] modern
[1:13:36] church and she started to get sick and
[1:13:40] as she got sick she changed to a
[1:13:43] powerless group of people whose only
[1:13:46] weapon was
[1:13:48] argument wow amen she could produce
[1:13:52] nothing in the spirit
[1:13:54] for her hopes were built on program and
[1:13:56] not on faith in his word they sowed
[1:13:59] program so they reaped program they
[1:14:02] sowed perversion so they reaped
[1:14:05] perverted children I say whatever you
[1:14:08] sow you shall also reap you say brother
[1:14:10] matth what ought we to sow we ought to
[1:14:12] sow faith we ought to sow hope we ought
[1:14:15] to sow the word we ought to sow the
[1:14:17] message of the hour into the lives of
[1:14:19] our children and we'll reap the Harvest
[1:14:24] amen amen whatever we sow that we will
[1:14:27] also reap can you say
[1:14:29] amen and so you don't answer a skeptic's
[1:14:32] question this is this is let me give you
[1:14:35] the biblical
[1:14:36] examples of giving an answer to every
[1:14:39] man acts chapter 4 I'm going to give you
[1:14:41] one example verse 14 turn in your Bible
[1:14:44] if you have your Bible use it tonight
[1:14:45] please just for me can you do that I
[1:14:48] give you permission to use those
[1:14:49] smartphones
[1:14:52] also
[1:14:58] acts 14 acts 4 verse
[1:15:08] 14 be ready to give him an answer to
[1:15:11] every man who asks about the reason of
[1:15:14] the hope that lays within you and behold
[1:15:16] the man verse 14 which was healed
[1:15:18] standing with them notice they could say
[1:15:24] nothing against
[1:15:27] it I'm gonna tell you what any Defector
[1:15:31] or
[1:15:32] doubter of God's Prophet can't do they
[1:15:35] can preach against him they could teach
[1:15:37] against him teach against his character
[1:15:39] teach against the stories but they can
[1:15:41] say nothing against the miraculous
[1:15:44] Miracles that took place and healings
[1:15:47] that took place in his
[1:15:50] meetings they could say nothing
[1:15:53] against it that's right but when they
[1:15:55] had commanded them to go aside of the
[1:15:57] council they conferred among themselves
[1:15:59] saying what shall we do to these men for
[1:16:02] that indeed a notable Miracle hath been
[1:16:04] done by them is Manifest to all them
[1:16:06] that dwell in Jerusalem and we cannot
[1:16:08] deny it but that it spread no further
[1:16:12] among the people let it straightly
[1:16:14] threaten them that they speak henceforth
[1:16:16] to no man in this name and they called
[1:16:20] them and commanded them not to speak at
[1:16:22] all nor teach in the name of
[1:16:26] Jesus but Peter and John answered and
[1:16:28] said unto them I love this answer
[1:16:30] they're about to give an answer about
[1:16:32] the hope that lays within them whether
[1:16:34] it be right in the sight of God to
[1:16:36] hearken unto you uh more than unto God
[1:16:39] judge you in other words you can answer
[1:16:43] that question for we cannot but speak
[1:16:46] the things which we have seen and heard
[1:16:51] so when they had further threatened them
[1:16:53] they let them go finding nothing how
[1:16:55] they might punish them because of the
[1:16:57] people for all men glorified God for
[1:17:00] that which was done for the man listen
[1:17:02] all the people glorified God when you
[1:17:06] glorify God it's not something new that
[1:17:08] didn't start in the 20th century that
[1:17:10] didn't start in 1906 glorifying God went
[1:17:13] all the way back to the mind of God when
[1:17:16] the sons of God shouted for joy and
[1:17:18] leapt in the spirit of God I say we
[1:17:20] ought to glorify God more amen all the
[1:17:25] people glorified God I'd Lov to been
[1:17:28] there to see how they glorified
[1:17:30] god notice he says and they glorified
[1:17:34] God and they he and he says they lifted
[1:17:37] up their voices verse 24 I'm sorry
[1:17:40] missed my place here uh he said verse 22
[1:17:43] thank you for the man was above 42 years
[1:17:45] 40 years old on whom this miracle of
[1:17:48] healing was showed and being let go they
[1:17:51] went to their own company and reported
[1:17:54] all that the chief priests and Elders
[1:17:55] had said unto them and when they heard
[1:17:58] that they lifted up their voice to God
[1:18:03] with one
[1:18:04] Accord it's a powerful thing when we
[1:18:07] lift up our voices to God and said Lord
[1:18:10] Thou Art God thou has made Heaven and
[1:18:13] Earth and the Sea and all that in them
[1:18:16] is who by the mouth of thy servant David
[1:18:18] hath said when did the Heathen rage and
[1:18:21] the people imagine vain thing
[1:18:23] the kings of the earth stood up and the
[1:18:25] rulers were gathered together against
[1:18:27] the Lord and against his Christ for of a
[1:18:30] truth against thy holy Child Jesus whom
[1:18:33] thou has anointed both Herod and pontis
[1:18:35] pilate with the Gentiles and the people
[1:18:37] of Israel gathered together for to do
[1:18:40] whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel
[1:18:42] determined before to be done and now
[1:18:44] Lord behold their threatenings and Grant
[1:18:47] unto thy servants that with all boldness
[1:18:51] they may argue fight fuss
[1:18:55] picker what was the boldness going to be
[1:18:58] for to speak the
[1:19:00] word oh ain't that what the Bible says
[1:19:03] you should go how do you how do you
[1:19:05] convince the gainsayer preach the word
[1:19:07] of God and I say more than that live the
[1:19:10] word of God live out a testimony show
[1:19:12] the world what Jesus can do in
[1:19:15] 2023 show them that he's still alive
[1:19:18] speak the
[1:19:21] word he says give us boldness by
[1:19:24] stretching forth thine hand to heal and
[1:19:26] that signs and wonders may be done by
[1:19:28] the name of thy holy Child Jesus and
[1:19:31] when they had prayed the place was
[1:19:33] shaken where they were assembled
[1:19:35] together and they were all filled with
[1:19:37] the Holy Ghost and they spoke the word
[1:19:40] of God with
[1:19:41] boldness the multitude of them that
[1:19:44] believed were of one heart and of one
[1:19:46] Soul neither said any of them that all
[1:19:49] of the things which he POS possessed was
[1:19:52] his own
[1:19:53] but they had all things
[1:19:56] common and with great power gave the
[1:20:00] apostles witness and with great power I
[1:20:05] say more than ever before we need what
[1:20:08] the Bible speaking of here to back up
[1:20:10] our lives and with great power he gave
[1:20:14] the apostles witness of the resurrection
[1:20:16] of the Lord Jesus and great grace was
[1:20:19] upon them
[1:20:21] all amen
[1:20:24] L I could read you acts we don't have
[1:20:26] the time I'm already out of time and I
[1:20:29] haven't even got
[1:20:31] started I could give you Acts 2 Acts 3
[1:20:34] acts 4 8-2 acts 5 29-32 scriptures I had
[1:20:38] written down here what you would find is
[1:20:41] none of those examples in the Bible you
[1:20:45] will never find a place in the Bible
[1:20:48] where the apostles after they were
[1:20:50] endued with power from the holy Holy
[1:20:52] Ghost you will never show an example of
[1:20:55] Peter or John trying to be
[1:21:01] Scholars you will never show them find
[1:21:03] them trying to be Scholars to go to
[1:21:06] school and to argue intellectual
[1:21:08] arguments with these carnal men who were
[1:21:10] questioning what they believed who were
[1:21:12] accusing and and bringing accusations
[1:21:14] against Jesus against the Church of God
[1:21:17] you'll never find them and arguments
[1:21:19] theological arguments are going on a
[1:21:21] chalkboard and drawing out their
[1:21:23] theology you say did they did they
[1:21:25] believe in the godhead absolutely they
[1:21:26] had a revelation of it they believe in
[1:21:28] predestination you better believe it the
[1:21:30] original church had the true revelation
[1:21:32] of the godhead of who Jesus was of who
[1:21:34] his family was of what happened in the
[1:21:36] Garden of Eden and they never went to
[1:21:39] school to argue
[1:21:41] it you'll never find SC you'll never
[1:21:44] find these men entering in intellectual
[1:21:47] arguments but in the
[1:21:50] contrary they simply
[1:21:53] preach the word
[1:21:55] amen and quote the word and if there's a
[1:21:59] seed that seed will hear the word and
[1:22:02] respond to the word and if there's not
[1:22:05] they dust their feet and move on to the
[1:22:08] next
[1:22:11] city amen
[1:22:13] Church none of these but you know what
[1:22:16] the modern church has done the modern
[1:22:18] Church who brother Brandon refers to and
[1:22:20] we have a lot to read from that that we
[1:22:22] may not get to
[1:22:23] the modern church has so analyzed
[1:22:26] scripture you say the modern Church
[1:22:28] brother Matt is that us I mean we're
[1:22:29] pretty modern no no no no
[1:22:32] no no we ain't the modern church friends
[1:22:36] but there is a modern church
[1:22:39] amen there is a modern Church in fact it
[1:22:42] started at an
[1:22:44] altar in
[1:22:46] Eden with a boy named
[1:22:49] Cain who wanted to worship his way and
[1:22:53] brother brandom says that seedline of
[1:22:55] Cain has always followed the false
[1:22:57] church has always followed the true
[1:22:59] church and a picture would be like two
[1:23:02] trees that were planted right beside
[1:23:03] each other in so close that their
[1:23:06] branches and leaves intermingled and
[1:23:08] intertwined one with
[1:23:10] another and the angel said to Jesus
[1:23:12] should we go and separate them Lord no l
[1:23:16] why you try to uproot the tears you U
[1:23:19] uproot the wheat also but leave it up to
[1:23:22] me just preach the word live the word
[1:23:24] def you say brother Matan what does that
[1:23:26] mean what are we to do about the modern
[1:23:28] church and the modern Church teaching
[1:23:30] I'll tell you what the prophet of God
[1:23:31] said you ought to do he says when the
[1:23:33] true church recognizes who she is and
[1:23:37] what she stands for I said when the true
[1:23:40] church how many are the true church
[1:23:43] recognize how many would say I want to
[1:23:45] recognize who the true church is what
[1:23:48] she stands for and that she can do the
[1:23:51] Greater Works she'll will be an
[1:23:52] invincible
[1:23:55] Army when she can discern and
[1:24:00] withstand the false Church
[1:24:03] Amen brother ROM says he says when she
[1:24:06] can discern and withstand that
[1:24:08] Antichrist spirit that comes into the
[1:24:11] church trying to defile it make it
[1:24:13] lukewarm formal cold and
[1:24:17] Powerless you see that modern church has
[1:24:20] all has has everything
[1:24:22] they have all the fruits they have the
[1:24:24] fruits of the spirit my goodness more
[1:24:26] than some of the true
[1:24:28] church that modern church has love love
[1:24:31] love love man I mean just they just they
[1:24:34] just they just bury you in
[1:24:37] love bury you in programs bury your bury
[1:24:42] your children in programs and and plays
[1:24:45] and daycares and and if you don't have
[1:24:47] children they got a nice coffee shop for
[1:24:49] you serving the latest greatest
[1:24:51] espressos right there at the the front
[1:24:52] door as you walk
[1:24:54] in some of the greatest intellectual men
[1:24:57] with intellectual Minds that will that
[1:24:59] will that will fix the itch of the
[1:25:02] year who the Bible says they would Heap
[1:25:05] unto themselves teachers having itching
[1:25:07] ears that modern church has so analyzed
[1:25:11] the Bible and taken a scientific
[1:25:15] approach that's how they do they treat
[1:25:17] the Bible scientifically they treat it
[1:25:20] I'm talking about the modern Church I'm
[1:25:22] talking about the big church we got here
[1:25:24] in town would fit perfectly in what
[1:25:26] brother brandham calls the modern Church
[1:25:28] Dallas Theological Seminary trained uh
[1:25:32] the theologically trained knows the
[1:25:33] Bible knows five languages I only know
[1:25:36] one on knows Hebrew knows Aramaic knows
[1:25:40] Greek knows all the languages has all
[1:25:42] the programs has the masses of people
[1:25:45] I'm talking about reformed deformed non-
[1:25:48] denominational denominational Baptist
[1:25:51] Southern Baptist doesn't matter what
[1:25:53] name brother brandom says you need to
[1:25:55] stop calling yourself names and you need
[1:25:57] to get into
[1:26:00] Christ those names won't save you only
[1:26:02] Christ will save you but they've so
[1:26:06] modernized they they've so analyzed even
[1:26:09] the Bible you can go online and read
[1:26:12] thousands and thousands of pages of what
[1:26:15] they call
[1:26:17] apologetics they they have they have
[1:26:19] they have which is which an apologetic
[1:26:21] is a to give a reasonable gospel
[1:26:24] presentation to to to to to uh
[1:26:27] Counterpoint the points of the Skeptics
[1:26:30] am they've so analyzed the scripture
[1:26:34] that when they're done Mark 16 is added
[1:26:37] to the Bible wasn't there originally the
[1:26:39] woman at the well that was added later
[1:26:42] in fact there's parts of the Bible that
[1:26:44] we have to admit are mythical and
[1:26:46] actually never even happened Sodom and
[1:26:47] Gomorrah you know
[1:26:50] mythical amazing just a Matthew ain't it
[1:26:53] just a few weeks ago some archaeologist
[1:26:55] found the city that what they believe is
[1:26:57] the cities Twin Cities right along the
[1:26:58] Dead Sea destroyed they got all the way
[1:27:01] down to the destruction layer they had a
[1:27:02] big conference about it and the and the
[1:27:04] archaeologists are are there in that
[1:27:06] conference saying how that they believe
[1:27:09] they found these ancient cities well
[1:27:10] some Christian Scholars were there these
[1:27:12] were Christian men these are theological
[1:27:14] men trained real well- trained men and

[1:27:19] video of it video of it and they're
[1:27:21] they're telling how that they they were
[1:27:23] there and they asked archaeologist what'
[1:27:25] you find at the destruction layer and
[1:27:28] and they and you the destruction layer
[1:27:29] is when they get down all the way to
[1:27:31] where the City was destroyed and they
[1:27:32] said did you find arrows CU they always
[1:27:34] ask that if you find arrows that means
[1:27:36] it was not a natural disaster that
[1:27:38] destroyed the city but it was men it was
[1:27:40] an Army did you find arrows and the man

[1:28:06] world's a heat
[1:28:07] event Matthew brother Matthew could give
[1:28:09] you a much better uh uh breakdown of
[1:28:11] this me and him fellowshipped about it
[1:28:13] we had both seen it and he said what in
[1:28:15] the world's a heat event he says well
[1:28:17] you you know you see what happens when
[1:28:19] when something goes over a 3,000 degrees
[1:28:21] Fahrenheit
[1:28:23] 4,000 Dees Fen when something reaches
[1:28:25] that temperature so they found some
[1:28:27] pottery down at the destruction layer
[1:28:29] and when they found the pottery they're
[1:28:30] rejoicing said oh we found real Pottery
[1:28:33] all the way back to the the Bronze Age
[1:28:35] going all the way back you know
[1:28:37] thousands of years and we could actually
[1:28:38] but they they turned it over and it was
[1:28:40] glazed and they thought oh no it's
[1:28:42] glazed that that means the destruction
[1:28:43] layer is ruined because glazing didn't
[1:28:45] come till Byzantine L time later maybe
[1:28:47] about
[1:28:48] 700,000 ad so they thought no it's been
[1:28:51] tainted but they sent off that Pottery
[1:28:53] to a lab over here in the states and
[1:28:55] they they analyzed the lab and said no
[1:28:56] no that that pottery's not been glazed
[1:28:59] well then what is what am I seeing and
[1:29:01] that that they said well it what was it
[1:29:02] called Matthew
[1:29:05] trinitite you know what trinitite is
[1:29:08] it's basically something that has
[1:29:09] reached over 4,000 degrees the same as
[1:29:12] if a nuclear bomb had nuked the
[1:29:17] pottery so what they've concluded is
[1:29:20] Sodom and Gomorrah was
[1:29:24] nuked and they found the bodies even the
[1:29:27] torsos of of some kind of a meteor
[1:29:29] common or something they hid it you know
[1:29:31] I'm sitting here that's wonderful I
[1:29:33] laugh like you laugh I said boy that's
[1:29:34] awesome isn't it awesome oh is there in
[1:29:36] Israel we went to the Israeli Museum
[1:29:38] there's the ponus pilot Stone there's
[1:29:40] the stone with Pilot's inscription did
[1:29:42] you know that theologians for years
[1:29:45] didn't believe pilate even existed maybe
[1:29:48] it was just inserted in the Bible but
[1:29:50] when they found his inscription then
[1:29:52] they suddenly said pilate must have
[1:29:53] existed when they found Sodom and
[1:29:55] Gomorrah here's this Christian the
[1:29:58] scholar and he's admitt into the IM say
[1:30:00] the other man he says you know I always
[1:30:02] just looked at this as mythical you know
[1:30:03] mythical part of the
[1:30:05] Bible and I thought my goodness you mean
[1:30:08] it took proof of a scientist an
[1:30:10] archaeologist to dig down to a layer to
[1:30:13] tell you that it was nuked for you to
[1:30:14] believe that God destroyed the city I am
[1:30:17] so glad Jesus said blessed are they that
[1:30:19] have not seen yet still have believed
[1:30:22] I'm so glad there's something in me that
[1:30:24] even though I don't have proof I still
[1:30:26] believe the word of God my faith isn't
[1:30:29] based on proof it's not based on a stone
[1:30:31] that says pilot it's not based on a
[1:30:33] piece of pottery that has 4,000 degrees
[1:30:35] it's based upon a transformation that
[1:30:38] has taking place in my life I could say
[1:30:40] I once was blind but now I see I once
[1:30:44] was deaf but now I hear I once was lost
[1:30:48] but now I'm found you say why do you
[1:30:51] believe because this this message has
[1:30:52] changed my
[1:30:56] life
[1:30:58] Hallelujah I we have a church that feels
[1:31:00] that
[1:31:02] way they've so analyzed it to where the
[1:31:05] woman at the well was added later
[1:31:07] there's mythical parts of the Bible they
[1:31:09] Chuck out anything that they see is
[1:31:11] unreasonable to their to believe by
[1:31:13] their carnal mind they even call some
[1:31:16] parts of the Bible just poetry
[1:31:17] allegorical just didn't really have a
[1:31:20] meaning they have ual
[1:31:22] variance textual
[1:31:25] criticism
[1:31:26] eschatology
[1:31:28] harmonics
[1:31:30] apologetics it's all man's attempt in a
[1:31:34] carnal intellectual way to answer the
[1:31:37] word of to answer the Skeptics against
[1:31:39] the word of
[1:31:41] God brother brandom says the very minute
[1:31:44] death entered the
[1:31:45] church and this is what he says he says
[1:31:48] she got sick she changed to a powerless
[1:31:50] group of people whose only weapon was
[1:31:58] argument let me give you an
[1:32:02] argument this is just a little
[1:32:05] excerpt of brother Perry Green's
[1:32:07] testimony I want to read it to you
[1:32:08] tonight the Lord just gave gave me this
[1:32:09] right before I came out here my family
[1:32:11] moved to Bowmont Texas in 1949 when my
[1:32:14] dad became pastor at Emanuel Gospel
[1:32:16] Church shortly thereafter we learned
[1:32:18] that there was a man by the name of
[1:32:19] William brandham that was conducting
[1:32:21] divine healing meetings in Houston Texas
[1:32:23] which was less than 100 miles away I was
[1:32:25] 16 years old how many 16 year olds raise
[1:32:27] your hand if you're 16 years old how
[1:32:30] many six 15 year olds oh don't be afraid
[1:32:32] 15 year
[1:32:33] 14 thank you thank you brother
[1:32:37] Mason how many teenagers do we have
[1:32:39] raise your
[1:32:41] hand some of those teenagers Den now I'm
[1:32:43] an
[1:32:46] adult I was 16 this is how old brother
[1:32:49] green is I just wanted to point it out
[1:32:50] just a teenager
[1:32:52] I was 16 at that time and had the
[1:32:54] baptism of the Holy Ghost and had an
[1:32:57] experience of speaking in tongues I read
[1:32:59] about Divine Healing read every miracle
[1:33:01] in the Bible and believed them since I
[1:33:03] was 9 years old I had quoted Hebrews 138
[1:33:06] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:33:08] and forever I had no idea what it really
[1:33:10] meant brother Bon was in the Sam Houston
[1:33:12] Coliseum on January 23rd
[1:33:15] 1950 arrived early early enough that we
[1:33:18] were able to get a seat in the lower
[1:33:19] section right in front of the ppit about
[1:33:21] 11 rows back he says as the service
[1:33:24] began the first speaker was brother
[1:33:26] Gordon Lindsay followed by Brother FF
[1:33:28] Bosworth brother bar then brother bham
[1:33:30] came to the pull pit and as he looked
[1:33:31] across the audience he said good evening
[1:33:35] friends it was so personal I thought he
[1:33:38] was talking to me I got up out of my
[1:33:41] seat and stood in front of the platform
[1:33:43] on the left hand side near the pull pit
[1:33:45] because I thought the man had spoken to
[1:33:46] me when he called for the prayer line
[1:33:49] about 15 people came forward I found
[1:33:51] found that from where I was standing I
[1:33:52] could directly view the prayer line I
[1:33:54] had never seen one before and didn't
[1:33:56] know what to expect the first person was
[1:33:58] a little seveny year-old boy that had
[1:34:00] been blind from birth brother bham took
[1:34:03] the boy by the hand and asked us to Bow
[1:34:05] our heads while he prayed for the child
[1:34:08] as soon as the prayer was over the boy
[1:34:09] looked around like he could see
[1:34:11] everybody be to praise the Lord my
[1:34:14] thought was how do I know the boy was
[1:34:15] blind they held up a handkerchief and a
[1:34:18] little boy reached out and grabbed it
[1:34:20] they held out a microphone cour and he
[1:34:21] stepped over it brother random says now
[1:34:23] run back to your daddy the boy turned
[1:34:26] and looked out at the audience of
[1:34:27] approximately 11,000 people he had never
[1:34:30] seen his dad when the child had been
[1:34:32] called to the platform a man came and
[1:34:34] stood next to me the man now called The
[1:34:37] Boy by name that was his dad the
[1:34:40] platform was about 4 feet high and the
[1:34:41] boy came to the edge of it leaped off
[1:34:44] into the man's arm arms he played with
[1:34:46] the man's red necktie then he saw the
[1:34:49] man's tears and touched them then he be
[1:34:51] began to feel the man's face just like a
[1:34:53] CH a blind child would that was his dad
[1:34:56] he threw his arms around his dad's neck
[1:34:58] and looked directly at me I knew I had
[1:35:01] seen a miracle this was the beginning of
[1:35:04] the change of my life there was also a
[1:35:06] young lady that brought up a
[1:35:07] six-year-old boy that had been born with
[1:35:09] no
[1:35:10] feet I said no
[1:35:14] feet not a not a not a tooth AE not a
[1:35:18] headache not a backache no feet
[1:35:23] I had seen a Bo he brought up a six-year
[1:35:25] boy that hadn't born with no feet
[1:35:26] brother bham took him in his arms and
[1:35:28] asked her to remove the stockings once
[1:35:31] more he asked us to Bow our heads which
[1:35:32] I did but again I watched Upward at
[1:35:35] brother brandom as he prayed I wasn't
[1:35:38] the only one watching because in the
[1:35:39] midst of his prayer it appeared that
[1:35:40] brother brandham dropped the little boy
[1:35:42] and many people in the audience gasped
[1:35:45] right in front of my eyes I saw two
[1:35:48] little feet
[1:35:50] created this still affects me to this
[1:35:52] day when I see little baby's feet it
[1:35:55] stirs something within my soul because
[1:35:57] of this miracle that I saw even while I
[1:35:59] was weeping over that another lady
[1:36:01] walked up in front of brother Brandon he
[1:36:03] had said to those in the prayer line you
[1:36:04] people need to confess your sins and put
[1:36:06] them under the blood because I'm not
[1:36:07] responsible brother green just goes on
[1:36:09] to give testimony after testimony after
[1:36:12] testimony let me tell you something my
[1:36:13] friends I'll say it again you don't need
[1:36:15] to search for Vindication it's already
[1:36:18] been Vindicated you don't need to
[1:36:20] research it it's already been spoken
[1:36:22] from the mouth of God brother bam says
[1:36:24] when the messenger's uh voice utters the
[1:36:27] ma the the the voice from Heaven Echoes
[1:36:30] what the Earthly messenger
[1:36:32] says you know what the problem is is
[1:36:35] that people have begin to try to
[1:36:36] separate the message from the
[1:36:41] Bible okay do I have my church do we
[1:36:43] have the church here I know this gets
[1:36:45] some people uncomfortable but come on
[1:36:47] help me preach here some people have
[1:36:49] tried to separate the word word the the
[1:36:52] spoken word from the written
[1:36:55] word friend let me just say to you
[1:36:57] that's a dangerous thing to do when you
[1:36:59] cut out the living Oracle the mouth of
[1:37:02] God the voice of God when you separate
[1:37:05] the message of the hour from the Bible
[1:37:08] you lose the effect that the message
[1:37:10] needs to have on you and your
[1:37:12] family when you deduct something brother
[1:37:15] bham said to brother Bram you abort the
[1:37:18] effect of the message that it can have I
[1:37:20] know that's not popular but I'm going to
[1:37:23] preaching any way the message of the
[1:37:25] hour brother I'll just go ahead and say
[1:37:26] it like I believe it is the mind of
[1:37:29] Christ I have the mind of Christ when I
[1:37:32] turn on the tape I have the mind of
[1:37:35] Christ when I read the book I don't have
[1:37:37] to ask the question I don't even have to
[1:37:39] ask brother Google I've got the table
[1:37:41] right on my phone that's my search
[1:37:43] engine that's where I go to my answers
[1:37:46] that's where I go when I have questions
[1:37:48] and problems I've got questions and
[1:37:50] answers time and time and time and time
[1:37:52] again oh God help our people to stop
[1:37:55] looking to carnal answers you already
[1:37:57] have the devil's answer it's already
[1:38:00] been given to the Church of the Living
[1:38:01] God I say it's time we ought to stop
[1:38:04] questioning it and start believing it
[1:38:06] start identifying oursel with it and say
[1:38:09] I believe it's God's answer for any
[1:38:11] question I have I believe it's God's
[1:38:13] answer for any problem that I go through
[1:38:15] anything I face in life I've already got
[1:38:18] the mind of
[1:38:19] Christ Hallelujah
[1:38:23] let me say this the supernatural Church
[1:38:25] doesn't need a supernatural explanation
[1:38:27] God interprets his word
[1:38:32] by I said God interprets his word
[1:38:37] by God interprets his word
[1:38:40] by bringing it to pass she has the word
[1:38:46] demonstrated that's her
[1:38:49] answer I said she has the word
[1:38:52] demonstrated that's her
[1:38:55] answer Amen brother Matt I believe that
[1:38:58] brother Matt preach that brother Matt
[1:38:59] she has the word of God that's her
[1:39:02] answer that's her that that she does it
[1:39:04] she has it demonstrated even brother
[1:39:06] branam refused to go into a debate
[1:39:08] listen as brother green begins to carry
[1:39:10] this on he says the next night there was
[1:39:12] a debate about Divine Healing Dr best a
[1:39:15] Baptist preacher who didn't believe in
[1:39:16] Divine Healing challenged brother bham
[1:39:17] into a debate brother bham refused it
[1:39:20] since he didn't want to AR argue he
[1:39:21] didn't want to
[1:39:22] argue I say if he didn't want to argue
[1:39:25] you ought to not want to
[1:39:27] argue he didn't want to argue the
[1:39:29] newspapers published Dr best's challenge
[1:39:31] brother uh brother FF Bosworth asked
[1:39:33] brother bam if he could take his place
[1:39:34] in the debate brother bham agreed to as
[1:39:36] long as he didn't fuss that night Dr
[1:39:39] Bess insisted that brother Bosworth
[1:39:40] begin brother Bosworth said that he had
[1:39:42] around 600 scriptural references that
[1:39:44] show Christ attitude towards the sick is
[1:39:46] the same today it's ever been he stated
[1:39:48] that if Dr best could take any of those
[1:39:51] scriptural references and with the Bible
[1:39:53] prove that Christ Christ's present
[1:39:55] attitude is not exactly the same towards
[1:39:57] the Sick As It Ever Was he would
[1:39:59] consider himself to have lost the debate
[1:40:01] Dr best said he would handle it when he
[1:40:03] took his turn one question brother
[1:40:05] Bosworth asked Dr best was whether the
[1:40:07] Redemptive names of Jehovah applied to
[1:40:09] Jesus or not if the seven compound
[1:40:11] Redemptive names of Jehovah were not
[1:40:13] applied to Jesus then Jesus was not
[1:40:15] Jehovah Gyra which is the Lord that
[1:40:17] provides a
[1:40:18] sacrifice which is the Lord will provide
[1:40:20] but Jesus is Jehovah Gyra then he's also
[1:40:23] Jehovah
[1:40:25] Rafa which is the Lord that hthy Dr best
[1:40:28] didn't
[1:40:30] answer when Dr beess took his turn he
[1:40:33] taught that Divine Healing was applied
[1:40:34] in the resurrection when this Mortal
[1:40:36] puts on immortality he didn't answer any
[1:40:38] of the scriptural references that
[1:40:39] brother Bosworth had presented Dr best
[1:40:41] claimed that the Baptist knew better
[1:40:42] than to believe in Divine Healing
[1:40:43] brother Bosworth challenged this in a
[1:40:45] nice kind of way he asked how many
[1:40:47] Baptists were present and several
[1:40:49] hundred people stood brother B had a
[1:40:51] meeting just the night before just to
[1:40:52] just just right before that he says how
[1:40:54] many Baptists are present 300 three he
[1:40:56] says he says uh let me let me he says
[1:40:59] how many Baptists were present several
[1:41:01] hundred people stood up then he asked
[1:41:03] how many of them had been healed by the
[1:41:05] power of God that week about 300 of them
[1:41:07] remain standing he told Dr best you have
[1:41:10] no argument with me you should argue
[1:41:12] with your own
[1:41:15] people I thought that was the wisdom I
[1:41:17] that was wisdom brother Bosworth brother
[1:41:19] Bosworth used that night Dr best hit the
[1:41:21] P hit the pull pit with his fist and
[1:41:24] said the people could say anything but
[1:41:26] that didn't make it right when Dr best
[1:41:28] saw that he was not convincing the
[1:41:29] audience he started calling for the
[1:41:30] Divine healer to be brought forth trying
[1:41:32] to make a mockery of brother brandom's
[1:41:33] up in the balcony the debate was finally
[1:41:36] stopped brother Bosworth told the
[1:41:38] audience he knew that brother Brandon
[1:41:40] was in the meeting and if he wanted who
[1:41:42] he could come and dismiss the audience
[1:41:43] he could come down he was in the balcony
[1:41:45] I later learned that brother Brandon
[1:41:47] said the angel of the Lord came to him
[1:41:48] and told him that it was all right to go
[1:41:50] down I remember seeing him come into my
[1:41:52] peripheral vision as he was coming down
[1:41:54] the side of the platform can you imagine
[1:41:56] 11,000 people in audience and he says I
[1:41:59] could see him on my peripheral coming
[1:42:00] down the platform I could almost hear
[1:42:03] Brother bman the tone of gentleness and
[1:42:05] humility that he spoke there was no he
[1:42:08] says he says there was no feeling or
[1:42:10] atmosphere of animosity or Vengeance
[1:42:13] there was no feeling of you're wrong and
[1:42:15] I'm right the only way a man can truly
[1:42:18] portray that is for him to truly have
[1:42:21] feelings like that brother Brandon was
[1:42:24] just as gentle that night as he had been
[1:42:26] the night before when he walked up and
[1:42:28] said good evening friends he told the
[1:42:31] audience not to feel badly towards Dr
[1:42:33] best because he's our brother here this
[1:42:36] man had just mocked
[1:42:38] him and brother Bram says don't feel
[1:42:41] badly towards him he's our
[1:42:45] brother and that Dr best has the right
[1:42:47] to believe it in his own way he stated
[1:42:50] that brother Bosworth had proved that
[1:42:52] Divine Healing is in the Bible and that
[1:42:54] Dr best could not disprove it he
[1:42:56] continued now I have never said that I
[1:42:58] was a Divine healer I do not heal people
[1:43:01] the only thing I do is PR to preach
[1:43:03] Divine Healing by the cross and by the
[1:43:05] Bible my brother here preaches salvation
[1:43:08] and he's not a divine Savior I preach
[1:43:11] salvation and neither am I a divine
[1:43:12] Savior I also preach Divine Healing but
[1:43:14] that does not make me a Divine healer I
[1:43:16] only make my statements and if they are
[1:43:19] true God will back them up
[1:43:21] if I tell something false then God will
[1:43:23] not honor anything that's false he will
[1:43:25] always honor the truth are you glad for
[1:43:27] that I tell the truth and God knows the
[1:43:30] truth now here was this here was this
[1:43:33] man the skeptic trying to debate brother
[1:43:35] brandham and brother bram's attitude to
[1:43:37] that skeptic is don't criticize him he's
[1:43:39] our brother he has a right to see it his
[1:43:42] way Dr best hired a photographer who had
[1:43:45] taken six photos of Dr best making
[1:43:47] gestures towards brother Bosworth during
[1:43:49] the debate when the the photographer
[1:43:51] developed his film he discovered that
[1:43:53] all of his negatives were blank except
[1:43:55] the last one which showed the pillar of
[1:43:57] fire above brother brenham's head in a
[1:43:59] Halo position Mr George Lacy examiner of
[1:44:02] questions documents thoroughly examined
[1:44:04] the negative for this Photograph and
[1:44:05] then he pronounced it as authentic based
[1:44:07] upon the above described examination and
[1:44:09] study I am of the definite opinion that
[1:44:12] the negative submitted for the
[1:44:13] examination was not retouched nor is it
[1:44:16] a composite or double exposed negative
[1:44:18] further I am of the definite opinion
[1:44:21] that the light streak appearing above
[1:44:23] the head in a Halo position was caused
[1:44:26] by light striking the negative amen amen
[1:44:32] during those meetings January 3rd 1950
[1:44:35] God updated himself to me he was no
[1:44:38] longer Jesus Christ of yesterday 2,000
[1:44:41] years ago he was Jesus Christ today I
[1:44:44] saw blind eyes open I seen feet created
[1:44:48] and I heard the secrets of men's Hearts
[1:44:50] told he is still the same today he
[1:44:54] hasn't changed you ought to give the
[1:44:55] Lord a hand clap of praise for
[1:44:57] that cuz if he was the same then I say
[1:45:01] he's the same
[1:45:02] now he's the same God then he's the same
[1:45:05] God
[1:45:06] [Applause]
[1:45:09] now what was it it was a
[1:45:12] demonstration it was a
[1:45:14] demonstration listen friends you can't
[1:45:17] explain
[1:45:19] God you can't even explain him to
[1:45:21] yourself how would you explain him to
[1:45:23] somebody
[1:45:25] else you can't explain the love of God
[1:45:28] you could try your best you could try
[1:45:29] your try your hardest but really who can
[1:45:32] really put a word who could really give
[1:45:34] a definition to the grace and the love
[1:45:37] of Jesus Christ outside of you can just
[1:45:40] say here's the life here's an example
[1:45:42] I'm the proof that God has Grace I'm the
[1:45:45] proof that God loves because he loved me
[1:45:48] I'm the proof that God has Grace because
[1:45:50] he had Grace for me but men has came men
[1:45:54] has came along with a scientific
[1:45:56] approach a modern church and they've so
[1:46:00] analyzed the scriptures they have
[1:46:02] apologetics and harmonics as we said you
[1:46:05] know what apologetics are apologetics
[1:46:07] are the science there's your first
[1:46:09] problem of Defending one's Faith amen I
[1:46:14] said I said it's the science of
[1:46:17] Defending one's Faith do you see where
[1:46:19] the first isue
[1:46:22] is
[1:46:23] science when you try to approach God
[1:46:25] from science you're already going the
[1:46:27] wrong
[1:46:32] direction the
[1:46:35] science of given that listen to what it
[1:46:37] says here the science of defends
[1:46:39] defending one's Faith so you're already
[1:46:41] taking a naturalistic approach you're
[1:46:43] already taken the the the same approach
[1:46:45] that the atheist take trying to satisfy
[1:46:48] the Mind listen friends you will never
[1:46:50] convince the mind of an
[1:46:53] unbeliever rather than that you ought to
[1:46:55] pray that God makes them a Believer amen
[1:46:58] you ought to stop trying to argue with
[1:47:00] them and convince them of Doctrine and
[1:47:02] start praying that God changes their
[1:47:04] life removes the darkness from their
[1:47:06] heart and transforms them into a new
[1:47:09] creation because if you ever get the
[1:47:11] Holy Ghost it'll lead you to this
[1:47:12] message if you ever get the B the true
[1:47:15] baptism of the Holy Ghost he'll lead and
[1:47:17] guide you into all
[1:47:19] truth
[1:47:20] it's all about the presentation this is
[1:47:23] why I'm just reading you right from
[1:47:24] apologetics website it's about the
[1:47:27] presentation of the Gospel they say
[1:47:30] every Christian should be able to give
[1:47:32] an adequate presentation of why they
[1:47:35] have faith in Christ listen to me the
[1:47:36] world doesn't need a presentation it
[1:47:39] needs a
[1:47:40] demonstration can I get a hearty amen
[1:47:42] can you can you give me a real loud
[1:47:44] supporting amen I said the CH the world
[1:47:47] is not in need of a presentation it is
[1:47:50] is in need of a
[1:47:52] demonstration it doesn't need an
[1:47:54] explanation it just needs a revelation
[1:47:57] and it'll bring a stimulation that'll
[1:47:59] produce a
[1:48:01] transformation and until God does that
[1:48:03] all you're arguing and fussing and
[1:48:04] fighting won't do a bit of good I say
[1:48:07] give me the power of God give me a life
[1:48:09] that can be give me a sermon that can be
[1:48:11] lived not just preached give me a give
[1:48:14] me a gospel that can breathe and that
[1:48:16] can have life or than can just be
[1:48:18] understood by my human mind give me a
[1:48:21] word that can
[1:48:24] live they say we need
[1:48:27] harmonics harmonics is the branch of
[1:48:29] knowledge I'm reading you straight from
[1:48:31] what the harmonic definition is
[1:48:33] harmonics is the branch of knowledge
[1:48:36] there's your first problem that deals
[1:48:39] with
[1:48:41] interpretation especially of the Bible
[1:48:43] or literary text I'm going to give you
[1:48:45] my harmonics and it's going to just take
[1:48:47] me just a minute to find them because I
[1:48:48] didn't have them in order here tonight
[1:48:51] uh let me just find them here I'm going
[1:48:53] to give you some you say brother Matt
[1:48:54] what's your harmonics let me give you my
[1:48:57] harmonics they're right here thank you
[1:49:00] Lord make sure I didn't miss one oh they
[1:49:02] were next thank you thank you Lord
[1:49:04] notice what it says here thus sayth the
[1:49:06] Lord remember what harmonics is
[1:49:09] harmonics is the
[1:49:11] knowledge that deals with interpretation
[1:49:14] of the Bible thus saith the Lord by his
[1:49:16] unfailing word stands and shall stand
[1:49:18] and be Vindicated there is how many one
[1:49:22] one Prophet Messenger to this age and on
[1:49:26] the basis of human behavior alone anyone
[1:49:28] knows that when there are many people
[1:49:29] there is even divided opinion on lesser
[1:49:32] points of a major Doctrine which they
[1:49:34] all hold together who then will have the
[1:49:36] power of
[1:49:38] infallibility who then will have the
[1:49:40] power of infallibility anybody's hands
[1:49:43] going
[1:49:46] up which is to be restored in this last
[1:49:49] age for the this last age is going back
[1:49:52] to manifesting the pure word bride how
[1:49:55] many believers do we believe how many
[1:49:57] Believers believe that we're to go back
[1:49:59] to manifesting the pure what is the pure
[1:50:02] word this Bible is the pure word of God
[1:50:05] and the true church will go back to
[1:50:07] manifesting this in its Purity
[1:50:11] unadulterated Untouched by man or his
[1:50:14] opinions that means we will have the
[1:50:16] word once again as it was perfectly
[1:50:18] given and perfectly understood in the
[1:50:20] days of Paul I will tell you who will
[1:50:22] have it it will be a prophet is
[1:50:24] Thoroughly Vindicated or even more
[1:50:26] thoroughly Vindicated than was any
[1:50:27] prophet in all ages from Enoch to this
[1:50:30] day because this man will of necessity
[1:50:33] have the Capstone prophetic Ministry and
[1:50:36] God will show him forth he won't need to
[1:50:38] speak for himself God will speak for him
[1:50:41] by the voice of the sign why did God
[1:50:45] back this message up with thousands of
[1:50:47] signs and wonders was it so that we
[1:50:49] could oh lift brother brandom up and
[1:50:51] make brother brandham God and make him a
[1:50:53] messiah no my brother my sister he
[1:50:55] Vindicated it so that you would know it
[1:50:58] wasn't the words of a man it was the
[1:51:00] voice of God
[1:51:04] hallelujah
[1:51:05] hallelujah and we do questions and
[1:51:08] answers today by God's help we have
[1:51:11] today by God's help read this with me
[1:51:14] Church bethl Tabernacle read it with me
[1:51:16] and we do have today by
[1:51:21] help the perfect
[1:51:23] interpretation of the word with Divine
[1:51:28] Vindication Give the Lord a hand clap of
[1:51:31] praise for
[1:51:32] that are you glad you got
[1:51:35] it how many would raise a hand and say

[1:52:33] really get to my sermon here tonight but
[1:52:35] it's a good place to stop I've read
[1:52:38] these things Lord and I believe it
[1:52:40] ignites the heart of Faith to the
[1:52:42] believer it might make the unbeliever
[1:52:44] mad that's all right Lord that's what it
[1:52:46] was sent to do it might make the skeptic
[1:52:49] mad that that's that's exactly why it
[1:52:50] was sent it might make the make believer
[1:52:53] make believe that's what it was sent for
[1:52:55] but to the True Believer which I believe
[1:52:57] that I'm preaching to I believe a True
[1:52:59] Believer has their hands raised to the
[1:53:01] True Believer these things make the
[1:53:03] believer
[1:53:05] believe and say God you're the same

[1:54:01] take up serpents and if they drink any
[1:54:03] deadly thing it shall not hurt them they
