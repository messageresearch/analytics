hospital with her we want to keep praying for her sister Wanda um update from for her for yesterday her blood pressure is still high and she's not feeling very very well Jackson that's becoming echoey to me so whatever you did that's getting like I'm in a well sister Linda Paris devil continuing to battle her her um the the one request that I had just before I got an update this morning was continued prayer for her throat and her breathing problems Brother Bruce wrote to me this morning she's still suffering from ear neck and head pain all symptoms indicate she has something that only occurs in one in a 100,000 Americans it's called gpn I'm not going to try to pronounce the medical name but it can occur after surgery um Brother Bruce says now that well I better try the name boy dog Meredith you may need to help me with this glasso Faria neurologia something something anyway brother Bruce says now that we have a name for that devil we can cast him out amen praise the Lord praise God sorry to butcher that word like that sister Mir amen I should have brought you up here and made you pronounce it for us amen but it's just a devil Jesus all C Jesus didn't use those medical names he called it a devil amen praise the Lord uh there's many any others who are out of town today on planned trips this morning so we sure are happy to have all of you here in the house of God Amen praise God Revelation chapter 1 this morning and we're going to pray for those needs right as I read my scripture Revelation chapter 1 catch the first three verses ah mom I wrote that down and and and didn't put it didn't transfer it over my uncle Troy also not doing well uh is that the continuation of what he was already sick on right right right continuing okay all right all right Revelation chapter 1 by the help of the lord we want to finish our Series today a amen I thought I would finish it uh before our meetings uh with brother Tim brother Timothy but uh you know as ironic to me not really ironic it shouldn't have been ironic anyway uh is that brother Tim really was and brother Timothy going down some of the same things we've been studying and looking at I was commenting to both of them you know the word being made flesh today I appreciated brother Matt Sunday School in that very same vein brother brother Don's prayer in that very same vein amen and um I tell you friends it is the bride's message of the hour amen the word is made flesh and living in the Earth again amen Revelation 1 1 to3 the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his Angel unto his servant John who bear record of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw uh seemed like I might have wanted to read yeah verse three blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep that's going to be an important word and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand you know to us it can seem like um a real taring of the Lord but to the lord it's not to the Lord time at end when he said that 2,000 years ago for God it's only 2,000 years is only two days amen so let's let's bow our heads father we thank you for your word this morning and Lord nothing should surprise us that you come in so many different ways and confirm your word to us father I'm humbling myself this morning before your presence asking you to help me to deliver this thought today I pray you will grant me wisdom Lord uh with the situation at hand I commit myself in into your hands and my spirit under the control of the Holy Spirit we commit it to you you in jesus' name father for our needs we read our prayer requests we have ministers Lord who are deployed in Ministry today we have sick and needy Among Us the needs are read out before you father and we are asking for your great Mercy on these cases today Lord may you may you touch and lay your hand upon father sister Wanda and sister Smith Lord and and our own sister Bruce as well our Lord we're we're sister Paris father we're asking for your mercy there and for my uncle Troy as well Lord may you have great compassion upon them and touch them now with healing Lord I pray for the Saints traveling out today in a way we commit them into your hands in jesus' name amen God bless you friends you can be seated it's not working can I pitch a fit okay yeah I think so all right praise the Lord no why I'm not working here on my back amen praise God in our scripture reading and remember that we are hoping to sum up this series today summing up the world near the end today would be part seven and we were told in verse three blessed is he that readeth and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand thank you brother the Kenny this particular word keep keep those things this is important today because remember that our theme and I want you to keep remembering this that the theme of this whole series has been the word to live through us so it's it's not merely your verbal testimony how many believe you'd say verbally amen that the message is true and that Christ is real amen we would all say that uh from our lips but does the voice of our life match the testimony of our lips amen so this word keep actually means to guard it means to keep an eye on it means to watch and hence to guard to keep it actually it actually tells you to be a warden to actually enforce make sure that you keep the words of this prophecy keep the things which are written there in for the time is at hand now it so it means to keep it means to obey and here is an interesting segue to Revelation 227 uh brother Mark give me Revelation 227 and when we read this verse you're going to find out it means to particularly to watch observe attentively keep the eyes fixed upon uh keeping for the Fulfillment of Prophecy now in 227 we read it we read this behold I come quickly blessed is he that keepeth there it is again the sayings of this book all right that keepeth the the the sayings of the the prophecy of this book so when we when we find the the Holy Spirit at the beginning of the book of Revelation you believe that's the bride's book absolutely is it its Mysteries where all it came back after Paul was already gone that's why Paul doesn't ever quote from it he was already gone when John come back and it was all written and locked up in symbol and mystery to be revealed and made clear at the end time now it's not that everything at the end time uh that was written in the book would only happen in the end time it would actually happen down Through the Ages but it would be made clear at the end time what God had been doing all along just like that's no different than when brother brandham says that that all the trumpets all the seven trumpets sound under the Sixth Seal and brother brandham is simply meaning that the six seal of course is the Tribulation so all of the trumpets pour out in the their fullness that doesn't stop the fact that they poured out partially down through history amen amen I mean we saw under the trumpets the the the 200 million demon chargers at Euphrates right and they were released and we know that happened in the middle part of the 20th century so it's not that the trumpets haven't had a partial fulfilling just like when the seals every every Church age brother Brenham said a seal was broken partially and a mystery dropped down and a messenger caught it now it wasn't the whole package it was it was God giving enough light for each age to to be able to redeem for them to believe so he could redeem his family even though the church had fallen away and had backslid he still was not going to lose even one of his children thank God so the trumpets are that way they they broke partially the the vials run in in parallel With The Trumpets They correspond to the trumpets if you ever read the trumpets put them in one column put the vials in the next column you'll see that they they they line up perfectly and so so so we realize then that all the trumpets sound under the six seal tribulation in other words they all come to pass in their fullness all right so so when we see this word at the beginning of the book of Revelation keep those things which are written that God has it in mind that the church wasn't going to keep it for no reason they were going to keep it so that they in chapter one so they could arrive at chapter 22 and God could have a family see and so he he at the beginning of the book and at the end of the book he's saying to them again behold I come quickly blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book so he's testifying that from from the beginning of the church ages to the consummation of the ages he will have a family who obey who keep who manifest his word does that makes sense you're going to find out that that above all other things is the marker that is the that is the evidence uh of who his true family are is that family who from chapter 1 to chapter 20 through 2,000 years will always say not just from their lips but in their life will'll say Amen to every word is that clear so this is why brother Brandon would say that puts denominations out of the picture completely because why because when the when the word came and the messenger went home they built that denomination on the on the on the Shadows of the previous movement and when the new when another seal broke and another messenger went forward they would not move on with the word so they in effect although they were admitting to the to the work of Calvary they were not confessing or agreeing in their testimony or in their lives they stopped saying Amen to every word so it puts out organized religion completely no wonder brother Brandon would come at the end of the ages and say to the church and I guess he had the authority he was the angel to the last age and he would say he's the signifying Angel John he's he's John's tour guide John tries to worship him several times and he keeps making it clear I'm just one of the prophets don't worship me he a true a sign of a true Prophet is he always re reverses worship back to God see he will never take it on on himself and so he so this was a sign of a true Prophet I'm so glad that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday day and forever so that you don't have to worry about how he would act today you don't have to try to figure that out all you have to do is read how he acted in a previous day when he was here on the earth and how he lived and how he conducted himself is exactly how he will live and conduct himself in the hour that we live in that's how you identify him you're going to find out I'm going to make the statement it's somewhere down in my notes I remember that it is the manifestation of the word that is the evidence of the new birth and it always has been it because it that's what proves Hebrews 13 and8 is when the ink on paper lives behind skin all right I'm going slow on purpose all right brother Mark let's have my my slides now I'm going to read through these and we're we're not going to take too much time I'm not going to do like Katie said and start freestyling so we're gonna just try to keep it keep keep going here let me turn my Gizmo on so summing up the world near the end part seven the time is at hand all right so brother Brenham says here now now listen friends the the reason that that I want to read these quotes is because I want you to have confidence in what I'm saying because I'm not pulling this out of thin air I'm I'm this is the the advantage you have this is the advantage you have in not just sitting at home playing this tape you have a minister that God has called you to sit under who can rightly divide and take these quotes with the scriptures and and and Stitch it into the fabric of your life and make and run alongside you that's the advantage of a true Shepherd he can run alongside you and and he can reach over while you're running through life and he can make changes without breaking stride without breaking your stride see so so so that's what we're attempting to do today all right so he says here the Bible is not a book of systems now really pay close attention this is this is 1965 this some of the last things the Lord wanted us to understand before his messenger goes home the Bible is not a book of systems no no sir it is not a book of systems nor a code of morals the Bible is not a book of systems so many systems and so forth no sir it is not a book of morals no sir it is not nor is it a book of History altogether or neither is is it a book of theology now it contains all of that but that's not its primary thing all right it is the revelation of Jesus Christ so the Bible is the complete revelation of Jesus Christ and it was wrote by prophets Hebrews 1:1 God who in Sundry times spake to the fathers by the prophets in this last day speaks to us through his son Jesus Christ which was the prophets all of them put together isn't that an amazing word it's all of them put together all right oh excuse me so Jesus was Malachi Jesus was Jeremiah Isaiah Elijah all that they were were in him and all that you are and all I am is in him words Witnesses of the word amen so so when when you look at it that way I mean listen friends I if this was all true before as he reads here you know the word was in Malachi so Jesus was in Malachi in other words Jesus was living in Isaiah Jesus was living in Malachi Jesus was living in Elijah if that was all true before the Lamb of God was even slain how much more is it today amen if it was true before the Holy Ghost came how much then what do you have available to you today say this is a terrible day but look at what's available to you see so it's not a a book of systems code a code of morals and he goes on here watch so it's not a book of systems a code of moral ethics neither is it a history book or a book of theology it is not but it is the revelation of of Jesus Christ God himself revealed from word to flesh from word to flesh amen that's what it was in Malachi that's what it was in Elijah that's what it was in brother M says that that Jeremiah was Christ in another different quote see because Christ means the anointed word I say Christ you immediately think of Jesus of Nazareth and you'd be right but that's not the only time Christ is applied Christ is applied any time the word is made flesh that's Christ that Christ means an anointed anointed word so whatever is the word The Living Word of that hour that's that's why the Bible could say that Moses was a God to the people yet he wasn't God but he was a God to the people because he was the anointed word of that hour see so you know theologians can argue all they want to with Kentucky Hill belly but they could not deny what he was saying because it was right in the scriptures see so so we find out then he says here it's a revelation of Jes Jesus Christ God himself revealed from word to flesh that's what it is the Bible is the word and God is the flesh God in the word rather and Jesus being the flesh it's the Revelation how God the word was manifested in human flesh and revealed to us and that's why we become a Son of God he he is a part of God you understand now he the body is part of God so much that it's his son so so when we're so so when we're reading the and i' I've been showing you this and I'm going to I'm gonna I'm going to nail it down again today when you're when you're reading the established word of God from history when you're reading the establish word as history that's not the same as reading the history that George Washington crossed the Delaware that's not going to inspire you to do anything you'll read that story and you go my goodness what a brave bunch of men that was and they got they got across the Delaware and we tell the story and they broke the ice and got across and surprised the hessan uh mercenaries who England had there and got a great Victory but that's not going to it wouldn't matter if I got a boat and cross of Delaware that's not going to get me closer to heaven right so so so brother Brandon would say this isn't just history see it's not not the same kind there's nothing about reading that story that will of George Washington that will that will cause you to become a further manifestation of that event you follow me you're not going to be a continuation of that because you read about George Washington doing it see so the word of God then now you can get it the word of God is more than just morals it's more than just history it's more than just theology it's a Living Word of God and it's designed to live in and operate through human flesh am that's why Jesus was a human see he was the beginning of the creation of God you're the continuation of that same creation so so it's it's always been designed to live behind the skin of God's Masterpiece creation say what's his Masterpiece creation Sons and Daughters of his kingdom see all down through the ages to the present age to right now and in the ages to come without end this has always been when brother Brandon said it like this when the books are closed for the last time the word will be flesh there's coming a day when they'll open The Book of Life at the Judgment bar and they'll open the books and the people will be judged out of the books and the and the Book of Life will be the final Arbiter and and if your name is is blotted out of that you have no chance if your name is is in it then you'll get a fair trial and you might make it in see everybody will get a fair trial thank God you know it all you say well what about people who who you know God knew them for their very purpose and like Pharaoh I've raised you up all listen friends all the all that is all the scripture is showing you there is that God by his forn knowledge knows who will and who won't now we're not talking about his elected family that's a whole different section of the book he's got a a a a a section of election that covers his gened family and then he's got the rest of it to cover everybody else that's ever lived in the Earth ever breathed air and God knowing the end from the beginning it's not hard for him to predestinate knowing who wouldn't he and who wouldn't he didn't force anyone he gives Every Man a legit opportunity but he knows who will and who won't see if if he doesn't know that he's how could he even be God so you you're never going to impune him you can't that's why I've said to you many times no one at the Judgment bar when you whether you read it in Matthew 25 or whether you read it in the Book of Revelation no one is crying foul holding signs or marching see so so because there's something about being in that presence that there's a knowing that you that you know you know what you are that's what I love about church oh I can come in here and get under the presence of God and sometimes if I think I'm I'm all right and I'm a pretty good guy and then the preach can get in the pull pit and I realize my need of God I say oh Lord help me today see and so this is why I I feel sorry for people who sit at home uh and just play tapes that you know the reason people do that playing tapes is a wonderful thing we're for that I love that you should do that every day I just said recently a tape a day will keep the devil away so nobody believes in listening to tapes more than me but do you know do you know I'm going to tell you something friends you know why the vast majority the vast majority I'm I'm not authorized to say every single person I can't judge everybody's Hearts but I know by the patterns of the word having studied it more more you know three quarters of my life I can see the patterns and the reason that people stay home and listen to tapes is because that's what they want to do that's the reason they don't go to church is because they don't want to and that's just the sad truth I'm going say it again the reason they don't go to church the reason that that that somebody was able to convince them even though brother brandham never taught that and they they they teach it in the name of brother Brandon but he never taught that and there's no quotes to support it and there's certainly no scripture to support it but somebody remember when I told you that if you go long enough time you'll look around to find you a version of The Gospel that you want to be true and people who don't want to go to church and don't want a responsibility of having a pastor who don't want to be responsible to other people who don't want to be in that kind of a mix because that takes something and people who don't want to do that finally let her someone told them what they wanted to hear and therefore they don't go to church and they don't have a local pastor and they don't mingle with a local with with the saints of God because they don't want to and they've allowed someone to convince them contrary to the scripture and contrary to the message that they can do that say what's going to be their fith that's not for me to judge I I certainly believe that there are Sons and Daughters of God Amen all through that movement I certainly agree with that I would by no means condemn the people I'm just saying that that's a false teaching and it's a false anointing and and if it really loved the people it would tell them what the word of God says amen enough of enough of that's not even my notes that's free God bless you on the internet if you turn it off okay all right so brother brandham goes on here all right and all the scripture is divinely given divinely set in order and the whole thing is a revelation of Jesus Christ the new and old Testament where they foretold of him coming what he would do when he got here and what he would do in the age to come that beautiful so that makes him the same yesterday today and forever see all right uh like in Hebrews there when Paul wrote it he is God Jesus Christ yesterday of the Old Testament he's Jesus Christ today manifested in the flesh and he's Jesus Christ forever in the spirit to come see same yesterday today and forever and he ever lives to make his word live what it said it would do for that age he is alive now he's alive he's living in you and me we have a particular age you're not living in a different age you're living in this one and you say my I I just sometimes I can't I can't seem to cause the word to live out of me like it should I'm here to tell you you you can maybe you're not the Bible says that there's no temptation taken you but such as is common to man but within that Temptation God will make a way for you to escape now he doesn't say you'll take it he just says I'll Make A Way whether you take it or not that's on you see but I'm here to take it I just say Lord let me take all of your word because I know that you're here I'm alive which means you're alive and we're here and that and I know that a prophet is saying that he ever lives to make his word live what it said it would be for that age and I just say Lord no matter what you have to do by whatever means necessary cause this vessel to look like this Bible amen see so he he's there whatever it said it would do for that age he is alive so here is the point that I was making to earlier so a manifestation of the scripture proves Hebrews 138 when you're living the life of the word you're proving that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever see so his proof of existence is his creation manifesting his word that make sense going to say it again his proof of existance he said brother brandham said in the quote he is alive he's here in this age well then his proof of existence in his is him in his creation making the word live when you are allowing the word to live through you you're proving he's alive see so this would literally serve as a model of vindication going forward Forever This is actually the reality of Hebrews 138 it's a major point that gets overlooked because too often times we want to prove Hebrews 138 by Doctrine now that's that's you say well what's so wrong with that it's not wrong but it's too easy because first of all the devil can do it better than you can right but what he can't do is reproduce that life I'm doing something he can't do greater is he that's in me than he that's in the world he can preach this same message that I can he can understand it as good as I can he was wiser than Daniel but he can't reproduce the life you have more power than his power see so this is exactly what God was doing at auua for the Manifest St ation of that day it was a restoration of the power that that came out of the upper room experience and brother Brenham said it had waned uh but God was bringing it back so the that listen friends that's what was going on when 30,000 converts were giving their life to Christ and smashing Idols in Durban 30,000 at once smash their Idols 25,000 I didn't hear William brandom say this I heard FF Bosworth say this on a tape he said we had 25,000 miraculous healings in One Moment In One prayer it blew his mind he said I never knew that could even happen he said I always thought all you could do is you if you wanted 25,000 healings you had to pray for 25,000 people he said it never occurred to me to do what William brandom did he said he got up and prayed for everybody and 25,000 people notable miracles see so so this is exactly what God was doing he was proving his word for that age say we aren't having that kind of meetings today that's CA our age isn't that age see our age is something different our ages it doesn't come so much with observation it's in secret but what's happening God is perfecting a bride right under the nose of Satan in his Eden see it was the commission that further brandham received from the angel in 1946 and he took it to the world but it but listen friends that was you say my if we just had all those days that was all just background to the third pole that was just background to what God is doing in this hour that you know the third poll begins of course with the opening of the seals and what does it do what's what's what's the word portion of the third pool cuz there's the miraculous there's the spoken word portion of it but what is the word portion of the third pole it's releasing back to his family the original word no more is it mongrelized or hybridized no more is it misunderstood even by the seventh angel who at first thought it was love amen at first he thought love is the greatest but he had to get corrected on that he and he said no the greatest evidence is saying Amen to the word listen friends you're not following the ministry of a man you're following the ministry of the son of man this is the portion of the third pole that's open to us the word the world that we live in I you know I could stand here today and take a long time just to talk about the elements of sin in the world and the the the the turmoil that's going on and the wars and famine but I'm not a newsman you can read the headlines yourself uh what I'm here to point out is that the world had to arrive in the condition of Luke 17 it was always going to come to this it was always going to hit the days of Noah it was always going to repeat the days of lot that was the Gospel going forward in the Ages was never going to stop that from happening happening see so brother Bram goes on all right so the Jews had to be repositioned under the trumpets because why why why did that have to happen because they've got to have their Day of Reconciliation to God with the blindness removed so what what did it take to get them into their Homeland whatever it took that's whatever it took and you say what is it going to take to keep them there so that they can receive I'm here to take something they can sing from the rivers to the Sea all they want to sing they can chant it they can chant the intifa and the annihilation of Jews and as a people but I'm here to tell you when Moses and Elijah come on the scene 144,000 are still going to be right there in that land and nobody's going to move them they're not even killable they're they don't even maybe know know it at this moment but they already have Immortal Life they can't even be destroyed they've got to be there Hallelujah that's the power of the word of God oh you can put your confidence in it there's nothing that can overcome God's word and if it's in you then nothing can overcome you I don't care I don't care how much up and down success the devil wants to that he has in my life and your life and he does it ain't going to stop me from being crowned with Christ Hallelujah so is this clear is this clear so let's let's go a little further all right so brother Brenham says he was alive in the Old Testament manifested watch when Jesus was manifested in the Old Testament as we believe it when Jesus was manifested in the Old Testament in a theophany in the person of MDC not a priesthood but a person the man see for this man had yet not been born but he was in a theophany it was Jesus in a theophany in the form of a man he says can you go with that all right all right can you go with that let me keep up with myself here all right we're going slow then when he was made actually human flesh and and uh dwelt Among Us in the person of Jesus Christ himself born of the Virgin Mary see they're the same guy the same person MDC and a theophany and Jesus born of Mary is the same person all right just he's now he's now the only begotten of the father because he's born of a woman all right so now watch so he's born of the Virgin Mary he come in that form so he could die because you can't you can't brother Brandon would describe it like this he explain it like this God can't die God's a spirit you can't kill god brother Bram said so God acted out the part of death in Christ now he said he didn't act he really did die Jesus really did die but Jesus was the body that God lived in brother brandham said it's so simple why do they make it so complicated see all right so he says um and then he was made actually human flesh and dwelt Among Us in the person of Jesus Christ himself born of the Virgin Mary he come in that form him so he could die and went back into heaven now in this last days he was promised to manifest himself in the fullness again of his flesh in spirit you say now wait a minute is this meaning when he comes back to Earth in Revelation 19 well he certainly Coming Back In the Flesh in Revelation 19 but the beauty of what William brandham is trying to get the world to understand that what he was promising in Luke 17 when you see the days of Noah repeat and we do and when you see the days of lot repeat and we have it then that's the time that's the time not at the end of the tribulation that's the time before the Rapture that Jesus Christ would come to the Earth in flesh again again and and he's living in you and me he's in his church just like he was at the beginning of the church see all right you're getting it I'm sure you're getting it Sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man now I want to make a point because a lot of even what I'm teaching you already know so now it's going to be my job and as I'm going along I'm dropping in application we've already done it a little bit but I'm dropping I'm going to drop in some more application because you can you can sit at home and hear this tape all right but now watch let's so so keep your mind with me all right don't miss don't miss those nuggets that are coming all right for as it was in the days of Sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man now look at the Sodom how it's set and what taken place and Jesus Christ being manifested in bodily form of his church today so am I am I off in left field see so he's in bodily form of his church today see doing the same thing same work same things that he did all the time never changes the Eternal one you say are you walking on water brother Jason and multiplying fish I'm doing something far greater than either one of those when he multiplied fish in loaves that attracted a people who only came for the Fish and Loaves you say what about walking on water if the Lord ever needed me to walk on water I'd walk right out there on it you see but the then then what is it that you're doing that's greater like Christ I'm trying my best to do always that which pleases the father that's what I'm doing I'm trying trying to be the word and whatever he needs me to be maybe he only needs a housewife to be a loyal housewife maybe he needs a man to travel a Seven Seas maybe he needs people to come to church and amen the word of God who just work jobs and have families and take vacations and and and support a church maybe that's what he needs you're doing the greatest thing you're doing what God has called you to do see the the opening of the word word is what has allowed us to do that you say well well why is that so great why is that so great you mean besides the fact that eight billion other people aren't doing it I mean how much greater you want see almost eight billion other people aren't doing that we're doing it blessed be the name of the Lord not because you're better than them but because you have said amen you have believed his word you have allowed his word to take effect in your life I I I I wish the desire of my heart would just be to preach just that for the rest of my time is just to talk about allowing the word to dwell in you richly I'd love to take the rest of my time and just talk about letting the mind which was in Christ be in you you oh my I want to finish up this series God willing all right let's see where we are all right so he goes on and upon Earth today he has manifested himself in the human bodies who our human bodies that he has called and done exactly the same thing he done in sunry times and in the times of the of his flesh upon the Earth so you remember we've been taking Hebrews 1 in Sundre time he spoke through prophets in the middle of the Old and New Testament he was a keystone and spoke through Jesus Christ and in the New Testament he's back in his many membered body he on the on the day of Pentecost it went from one Jesus to 120 and within hours it went to 3,000 and within days it was thousands more and God just kept adding Jesus Christ to the church daily as he would and they continued in the apostles Doctrine and the breaking of bread amen that's the sign of the true church it always has been those who follow all of his word without denying any part of it that's not just Doctrine that's that's a people that do not deny God his privilege to live his life through them Amen in case that went over your head it's not just denying doctrinal teaching you might misund understand teaching and deny it that wouldn't send you to hell you can't disbelieve what you don't know and since sin is real Sin is unbelief you can't disbelieve what you don't know you just ask God to make it clear that's not what we're talking about we're talking about when the Holy Ghost is calling upon you for Holiness and separateness from the world and you won't do that it's calling you a prophet is screaming out make Jesus the center of your life and you won't do that he's saying he needs to be first in your life and you make him second third fourth or fifth then then then you're not taking a stand for the word doesn't matter what you believe intellectually amen all right all right so he's done in Sun Times and and in the times of his flesh upon on the earth and doing the same thing today because God In sunnd Time spoke to the fathers through the prophets in this last days through his son Jesus Christ see the son being revealed in the last days God manifested in human flesh setting Just Before sodom's Destruction the end of the Gentile world do you see it do you see see it are you sure you see it do you see it in real time happening around you do you see Sodom going to destruction do you see what what is it you see brother Brandon preached the message look what are you looking at you say my goodness brother you know uh why why you emphasizing it because depending on what you see that informs your thinking as to what you should be doing see and what your life and your dedication to God should look like when I see people who who come right into this church and believe the same message I believe but I don't see the word having preeminence in their life then they don't see it they might see the message but they don't see the what's happening in the world if they did it would drive them to their knees they would think about their children walking around in this dark world and they wouldn't let go of God until they were filled with the Holy Ghost they wouldn't let their career interfere with that they wouldn't let school or work or jobs or anything they wouldn't let Recreation they wouldn't let vacations they wouldn't let anything interfere if they really saw it in real time happening around you see if you see it then what should you be doing if you see it if you see Luke 17 if you see the days of Noah and you believe it and you see the days of lot and you believe it and you can see and you can observe and and on the fact that the world is vile and full of sin and it's Satan's Eden if you can see that then what should your life and dedication to God look like I don't need anybody to write me a note or tell me or stand up or raise a hand ask yourself right now if I really see the world in the condition that it's actually in then what should my life look like what should my prayer life look like what should my home life look like what should my activities look like what should my Recreation look like what should I be feeding on Amen you know there's much wondered at concerning the little wooden room brother brandom I'm not going to take the time today to uh read the quotes of that story you're familiar with it brother brandom said I was in something like a big tent in one place in another place he called it a big Cathedral so I don't think we're trying to look for some canvas built tent on five or 10 or 50 or a million polls somehow that the bride is all going to meet under it hey if that happens I'll be on the front row I promise you I'll be right on the front row but that's not what I'm looking for I'm not you know you say well that's you should be shocked well brother brandham said I'm not even looking for Revival he said I'm looking for the coming of the Lord I'm not I'm I'm you know the the reason the world misses the the word of the hour you know the the main reason they miss the word of the hour because they're looking for the nail scarred man and they don't see him until the into the tribulation he doesn't come back until Revelation 19 his feet never touch this Earth and because they're looking for the nail scar man now that's why they don't see him in the form of his word see they join a church and just wait it out there's much wondered at where he said I was up there and he said that little light he said it's to my right and there was a little wooden room and he said the the angel of the Lord he said that Pillar of Fire he said it left me and it went down into that room and he said as it was going he said I'll meet you in there and brother brandham called behind him why and he called back because it won't be a public show and he went in and brother brandham describes how that a prayer line is formed and people are coming to that line and you know people went in and the pillar of fire was in there and people came out the backside hole right and when they were even asking the people what happened in there brother brandham said the people were saying I don't know I I don't know I I went in I had a need I'm out my need is met I went in sick I'm now I'm whole I went in Bound now I'm delivered I went in oh I'm GNA tell you something friends I guess it was from whatever was hindering them whether it was physical or whether it was emotional or whether it was mental I mean listen we don't know precisely what it all means just before the Crossing over but but I do know that there is something just ahead of us I can tell you friends I I I can't put every Peg together for you we don't have the whole picture it's going to manifest itself but I know that it's happening now and I know that it's going to get greater and greater Hallelujah life I mean think about when they go through there I thought about this my wife and I were talking about it life unencumbered what a wonderful thing I mean sometimes you know people say well you know I I I might say you know I love life I love life and sometimes people could say well if you had my life you wouldn't love life my life is horrible well but but come on that's you're only thinking that because you're suffering if I just took the suffering away you wouldn't think like that life is wonderful life is God in him was life and that was the light of men this is a this is what created the whole Cosmos this is what made a beautiful garden of not human with limited view but God looked on all of his life and said it's good no it's actually very good so see friends imagine if I took away every circumstance that caused you any distress then life is a beautiful thing God gave us life and we we love life and every human wants to live I i' I've seen people who are down at death store and they wanted to live what is it that people it's not always a fear they just they don't you know I one of the queens of England she said oh if I'd give everything for this five more minutes of Life see just like I mean that's no different than than if the world was unpolluted I mean I what we love the world what we don't love is the world order all right so but we we love the world you know it's it's the contaminations of the world and the contaminations of the earth that burden us as brother Brenham said the cosmos the world world order that's what we wish was different different thank God it's going to be but I love the earth I love nature we we take hikes in the wilderness Trails we you I've done it you've done it we've we've summited mountain peaks and when you get up there and you breathe in all of that fresh air oh there's something euphoric about it it's invigorating it's renewing how many have done that see it it feels like such a deep cleansing of the human spirit I mean I love nature we watch animals we my my son's got me into watching birds and everything we were looking sister Debbie and I she'll scream in the house come quick hurry run I think the world's ending and it's a bird on and and I got to grab the oh it's beautiful you see that green that blue wow what kind is that I know call Jonathan she scared me to death the other day I thought she was being murdered and it was just a bird and was a beautiful one though I have to admit so so you know we we we see these things we we see you know you see highdefinition video of great Mammoth whales hundreds and hundreds of tons breaching the surface and soaring and crashing down with just a thunderous effect oh my it it has it has such an effect on us we love the world it's it's the world order that brother brandham said we're unfitted for catch it he said that in the 60s he said in the 60s that was Kindergarten yeah amen that was nothing compared to now and he said in the 60s that psychiatrists were having to go see psychiatrist and doctors were prescribing uh medicine to doctors and and he said it's a neurotic world and a neurotic age and he said it's an age that we seem unfitted for oh I can so relate to that I I'm unfitted for this world none of us like it it's uncomfortable it's full of unrelenting pressures of life that you know we have to daily walk through and the constant stress and the anxiety of decisions and actions and and and and then I mean that that pales you know our stresses and our anxieties we think are so bad but that that pales in comparison to the horrible sin of war and disase disease and suffering and sometimes if we'd be honest sometimes suffering can snowball and have such an effect that we get like Paul when he said to the Corinthians I was pressed out of measure until I even despaired of life that's the Apostle who literally despaired of life and he says he says I felt as though I had the sentence of death within myself I want to say to you today imagine just for a moment stripping everything away that came after the fall imagine the life you would have right now in Real Time Imagine stripping away a removal of everything that got added to my life that wasn't supposed to be there where only Pure Life remains imagine if you could stand in this room today and the only thing of your whole existence was just pure unfettered unadulterated life all of our stresses all of our fears can you imagine it all of our anxieties all sickness all injury all calamities all gone all fleshly weakness towards sin and our fa years all gone imagine that for a moment oh I'll be happy friends oh my I'm here to tell you I whatever that little wooden room is I don't know maybe it's just a supernatural decontamination chamber I think if I ever needed a decontamination chamber someplace I could go in and have my mind cleaned and my heart purged and it strip away everything except what God ordained for me before the foundation of the world perfect health think about it perfect strength perfect love perfect Faith a perfect life mind body and soul perfect I don't know what condition I don't know fully what condition I'll be in or that you'll be in right at the moment of our just before for our change but here's what I do know now beloved now we are the sons of God I do know that yeah I got plenty of failures plenty of weaknesses plenty of stress plenty of anxieties plenty of decisions but I know that underneath all of that debris there's a life pulse beating and I know that someday this robe of Flesh will fall I I know that I am a Son of God and it does not appear what we shall be but we know when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is I know that much and that helps me quite a bit I say Lord bring on the little room amen is that your desire whatever that looks like whatever that'll be because as I said if I ever needed a spiritual decontamination chamber it's it's today it's right now I mean you're living in a day with unprecedented levels of evil where the the degradation and the insanity of man's mind is permeated I mean it's it's systemic it's in every country it's in every culture if there was ever a time when we need a spoken word of creation friends if there if there was ever a time when I could say is David created me a clean heart would that be today for you friends you say Lord give me that decontamination chamber what do you want me to do for you create in me a clean heart oh peel away Lord all my doubt and all my fears and you know so that I can see him as he is see say can I see him as he is I can because he's in me see he's in me and and you know I can we can come here to church we can preach we can sing we can be happy but then what happens when you go home what happens on the job tomorrow oh my I just I want to see it every day I want to see it every moment I want to see his life living through my life through my whole body we're almost home friends we're almost home my it's time to press the battle we're living in a day when the power of the spoken word of God of creation is here now I am promised in this day a releasing of power in the very midst of an impossible age in the very midst of Satan's Eden a creation power that has the ability to purge my heart to wash my mind listen there is available before I wind it up today I just want you to know there is a fix fix all chamber you have available to you today a fix all chamber that you can go in and have yourself purged clean a place where where he can do for me that which can't be explained say how'd you how'd you get over that I don't know he just did it amen believe God has these decontamination Chambers around the world you believe he does oh he's got him in North South Carolina North Carolina he's got him in Tennessee he's got him in Oklahoma he's got got him in Kansas he's got them in Indiana he's got them in Florida he's got them in Georgia he's got Believers from sea to shining sea amen he's got them from the tip of North America to the tip of South America he's got them he's got them from Manchester to London he's got them from Moscow to Kev he's got him in deran he's got him in joelberg he's got him in the cape he's got him down under he's got them everywhere he's got one in in Buford today and you're sitting in it hallelujah oh my he's got him everywhere my we're not talking about a mere structure of roof and walls hope you're not hope you're not thinking that I'm meaning this building of brick and mortar you haven't come to a place of brick and mortar you've come to Mount Zion amen and to the city of the Living God oh don't miss your day of visitation friends amen all you need to do is be willing to enter in with Christ let me finish through these quotes real quick I just say do whatever you have to do hear me do whatever you have to do change whatever you need to change only get there and live there all right so brother brandham now the reason it's taking me longer is because I'm going slower but you told me it's okay all right I want to finish these quotes you good all right so brother Brenham says now he's going to uh note still in the same sermon there is three manifestations now watch he's going to give you two different examples of three manifestations here's the first one now the next thing happens is when is when it's all gathered up into that one person Jesus Christ bride and body at the physical Return of the Lord Jesus making his three times when he was brought on Earth killed crucified raised up manifesting himself in the form of his body which is his bride the woman all right you still with me you get it he says she and man just close together till they're just almost they're they're the same they ought to be anyhow they they are see they just exactly manifested the same she is part of him because she was taken out from him see and the bride today is taken out from the body of Christ which is acting and doing just exactly like he said it would do for this day the bride the Queen the the queen king and the queen so God has these these decontamination Chambers all over the world and we're finding out that it's brought us to a place where this can become a reality in our in our very lives so so when he says here now there here's a scripture where brother brandham uh where I actually quoted it to you we are you are come to Mount Zion under the city of the Living God that's Hebrews 12 brother Bram talked about it often it goes on to say and to Jesus the mediator of the New Covenant to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of Abel so I know the re reation of Abel that he received was from God you agree I know that it met the challenge of the hour then all right but that day on Calvary gave me a better sacrifice than Abel yeah see because I'm going to have a greater challenge a better sacrifice gave me a better position it's a position where where where as as sister Deborah put it in their in the skit that that it's not just that your sins are covered your sins are purged they're taken away hallelujah oh my that's the very thing David longed for and strove for amen and I I came here this morning for that kind of a cleansing friends a power to live a higher life and I plan to go higher still how about you now I and I'm gonna fly over this part here because we've already taught on it quite a bit when when we when we found that we gave you the example of Isaiah and Isaiah Rema Came Upon Isaiah and he said behold a virgin shall conceive and then once he wrote it and it went it went on parchment then Isaiah passed away then it became logos it became the established word you remember that and then when Gabriel comes to the Virgin Mary and he goes back and quotes the word the logos of Isaiah and when Mary says be it unto me according to Thy word then it became fresh Rema to her amen and and so so so I I said to you last time John saw and wrote in a book that as it was in the days of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound John was writing what he saw and heard and when John left and came home from patmas that went into the Bible that became logos and it waited 2,000 years and a people at the end time now it becomes Rema once more because we believe it not only do I believe it but I am it Hallelujah this is this is exactly why when when we here we are reading these quotes listen friends here we are reading these quotes when William Brandon was saying them they were Rema to him and then they went on t AP and then they went in books and then he went home and here we are today sitting in a church going back reading his quotes and you know what's happening logos is becoming Rema all over again it became the established word do you realize that that's why it's effectual in your life do you know that that's why you're writing a second book of Acts because it's not just logos it's not just the established word the all the denominations have the established same Bible I carry but I'm a living example of the word do you realize that on the day of judgment that that is what will allow God to rightly judge the world because because of what the bride became right because when you leave here right now you're you're experiencing Rema say how do I know it's Rema because it's changing your life every day it's drawing you closer and closer is it amen then that's Rema but what's what's going to happen friends is on the day of judgment God is not going to have to go back to the first book of Acts to judge this last stage he'll go to the second book of Acts because of people became the word and that becomes the established logos at the day of judgment and he'll judge that's why Jesus said to his listen Jesus said to his generation that that the queen of the South the men of Nineveh will rise on that day and judge this generation the queen of the South back there will rise on the day of judgment and judge this generation speaking about his own generation and he said because and it listen it had it had very little to do with what the queen of the South said it had everything to do with what she did the Bible records that she said there was nothing like it no words to describe she gives a a testimony about being with Solomon but brother Brandon when he comes to the Queen of Sheba he doesn't talk about what she said as much as what she did she crossed the desert she risked her life she went three months just to hear a church service oh it wasn't what the men of Nineveh said it wasn't what Jonah said the Bible says it's what Nineveh did they repented they covered themselves in sackcloth and Ashes they called a fast even the king came off his throne and sat in ashes even they put sackcloth on the animals they wouldn't even let the animals eat or drink and the whole Nation repented before God and Jesus said those men will rise and condemn this generation not because they had more knowledge of the Bible than the Jews but because they had obeyed the word of God your life this second book of Acts is what God will be able to justifiably judge the world for because no one can say it couldn't be done because he'll have a queen sitting with him on the throne that's you and me that's where we are right now I'm going to stop today I I can't get finished why don't you stand up with me have our have our musicians come brother Kenny come on and let's sing a song or two amen my I looked down at my quotes and I got a bunch more so we'd be here till way late amen and since I'm not Matt or brother Tim and since neither one of them are here I can
