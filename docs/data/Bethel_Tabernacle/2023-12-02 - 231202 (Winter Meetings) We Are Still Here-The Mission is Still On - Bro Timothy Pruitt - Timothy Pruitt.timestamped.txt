[37:39] that's here every life Lord we just ask
[37:42] father you'll touch each and every one
[37:44] we pray in Jesus name
[37:48] amen amen turn to very familiar
[37:51] scripture Amen to Mark chapter
[37:55] 16 amen
[37:58] most of us no doubt can quote this
[38:00] scripture by
[38:02] heart amen but I hope it's more than
[38:05] just words on a paper it's something
[38:07] that we take very dear to our hearts
[38:10] amen that because brother Brandon would
[38:13] say it was the last words that fell from
[38:15] the lips of Our Lord amen when somebody
[38:18] gives you their last words it's usually
[38:20] very important amen amen Mark 16 and
[38:23] verse1 15 and he said unto them go ye
[38:26] and into all the world and preach the
[38:28] gospel to every creature and he that
[38:31] believeth and is baptized shall be saved
[38:34] but he that believeth not shall be
[38:36] damned and these signs shall follow them
[38:38] that believe in my name they shall cast
[38:41] out Devils they shall speak with new
[38:44] tongues they shall take up serpents and
[38:46] if they drink any deadly thing it shall
[38:49] not hurt them and they shall lay hands
[38:52] upon the sick and they shall
[38:55] recover so then after the Lord had
[38:57] spoken to them he was received up into
[38:59] heaven and sat at the right hand of God
[39:01] and they went forth and preached
[39:03] everywhere and the Lord working with
[39:05] them and confirming the word with signs
[39:08] following amen amen we'll let you be
[39:17] seated we would know this passage of
[39:21] scripture as the last commission or the
[39:25] Great Commission and I I was just
[39:27] looking at this word commission is the
[39:29] act of committing or entrusting a person
[39:33] or group with supervisory power or
[39:38] authority it's a authorative order or
[39:41] charge or direction or it's another one
[39:44] is formally to choose someone to do a
[39:47] special piece of work amen I believe if
[39:51] he's going to choose someone to do a
[39:53] special work he's going to have a
[39:55] special people to do that work amen
[39:58] Jesus said go ye into all the world and
[40:00] preach the gospel to Every Creature how
[40:03] far all the world who too every creature
[40:07] amen and these signs shall follow them
[40:10] that believe how long all the world who
[40:13] to Every Creature these signs shall
[40:15] follow them in all the world and to
[40:17] Every Creature I believe he was trying
[40:19] to make us understand what that CU he
[40:21] repeated it several times to all the
[40:23] world to Every Creature these signs
[40:25] shall follow them in my name they shall
[40:28] cast out Devils speak with new tongues
[40:31] and they take take up any deadly thing
[40:32] or serpent or drink a deadly thing it
[40:35] will not harm them they shall lay hands
[40:37] on the sick and they shall recover this
[40:39] was his last commission to his church
[40:42] and he said Paul was later ordaining
[40:45] these gifts into the church 30 years
[40:46] later and said in Galatians 1 and8 if an
[40:49] angel from heaven preaches to you any
[40:52] other gospel than this which is already
[40:54] received let him be accursed amen he
[40:57] said so therefore I believe that the
[40:59] Pentecost began without an end he said I
[41:02] believe it is to Every Creature at all
[41:05] times at all places that Pentecost
[41:07] should always remain the Pentecostal
[41:10] blessing upon the people you say well
[41:12] what is the Pentecostal blessing it's
[41:14] the confirmation of the Resurrection
[41:18] it's the confirmation that the same
[41:20] spirit that raised Jesus from the dead
[41:22] will also Quicken our mortal bodies he
[41:25] said no wonder gospel itself means good
[41:27] news good news of what he raised from
[41:30] the dead and because I live ye can live
[41:33] also ye which were once dead in sins and
[41:37] trespasses God has quickened us up
[41:39] together by the spirit that raised Jesus
[41:41] from the dead and we are now sitting in
[41:44] Heavenly places with him communing with
[41:46] him talking with him he said what a joy
[41:49] to tell people that story that believes
[41:51] it to be the truth he said I'm wondering
[41:53] what's happening today are we really
[41:55] getting people people to God or are we
[41:57] really getting them just to church he
[42:00] said we must get them to Christ but
[42:02] where the quickening power lays amen
[42:05] it's good to go to church that's as far
[42:08] as you go in it but it's not far enough
[42:10] when you come to church that's good but
[42:12] go on to Jesus Christ right that is the
[42:15] commission of the church amen is to get
[42:18] people not to a Creed or to a Dogma or
[42:20] to some man's idea or a new religion
[42:23] that's not what this is about it's to
[42:25] get people to Jesus Christ cuz if we
[42:28] haven't got him to Jesus Christ we have
[42:30] utterly failed in our job amen and I
[42:33] believe that there's a people though in
[42:35] this hour that has gotten to more than
[42:37] just a Creed or more than just a Dogma
[42:40] or more than just an idea or more than
[42:42] just a belief system or more than any of
[42:45] that but they have actually realized and
[42:47] understood that the life that was in
[42:49] Jesus amen as it left his body there and
[42:52] it broke out upon the day of Pentecost
[42:55] and is now moving now again in this last
[42:57] day is now quickening Siege once again
[43:00] and it doesn't matter how dark it is how
[43:03] deep you are how far lost you are amen
[43:05] if there's a seed of God on the inside
[43:08] of you that quickening power is going to
[43:10] find you and it's going to bring that
[43:12] quick that seed that's ordained to life
[43:15] he said we must get them to Christ
[43:17] that's good amen it's good to go to
[43:19] church it's good to do those things
[43:20] nothing against that but if you just
[43:22] come to church and you just change from
[43:24] one Church to another one believe system
[43:26] to another that's not what we're trying
[43:28] to do we're trying to get people to a
[43:31] life amen the life of Jesus Christ he
[43:34] said the very essence of this
[43:36] Resurrection is to tell and show and
[43:39] prove that Jesus is raised from the dead
[43:43] he is not dead he lives he lives here he
[43:46] lives in us and if I be with you in you
[43:49] even a little while the world seeth no
[43:52] more yet ye shall see me for I'll be
[43:54] with you even in you and to the end of
[43:56] the world so what was the last
[43:59] commission he gave Mark 16 the last
[44:02] words that fell from our Lord's lips
[44:04] when he commissioned his church how
[44:06] many's part of his church amen this
[44:08] commission did not end with the with the
[44:10] apostles amen it continues all the way
[44:12] down to the coming of the Lord Jesus
[44:14] Christ amen this commission it came from
[44:17] the Lord's lip go into all the world and
[44:20] preach the gospel he that believeth and
[44:22] baptized shall be saved but he that
[44:24] believeth not shall be damned now
[44:26] remember he may be damned he might have
[44:28] a chance he won't have one Earthly
[44:31] chance no uncertain sound about that if
[44:34] he don't believe he'll be damned all
[44:36] right amen now what kind of sign is
[44:39] going to follow them these signs well on
[44:42] some of them will it follow perhaps it
[44:44] will maybe will these signs shall follow
[44:47] them that believe what signs they will
[44:50] believe in
[44:52] healing they will believe in casting out
[44:54] Devils they will believe in speaking in
[44:57] tongues is I'm not making this up as a
[45:00] direct quote they believe they will
[45:02] believe in all the supernatural works of
[45:05] God the resurrected Jesus Christ working
[45:08] among them is that the truth is that the
[45:12] truth it's God's Last Words then cursed
[45:15] is he that tries to add to or take away
[45:18] from it that's just the way it
[45:21] is hallelujah that's just the way it is
[45:25] so we are under a commission we are
[45:27] under a commission to believe in healing
[45:30] we are under a commission to cast out
[45:33] Devils amen we have been given amen
[45:36] authority over the enemy of God Amen
[45:39] that wants to come and take our our our
[45:41] our children captive or our people
[45:43] captive by sicknesses or sin amen
[45:46] there's a Church of the Living God who's
[45:48] been given a commission to cast him out
[45:52] amen I still believe in a church that
[45:53] does that I still believe in the signs
[45:56] and wonders of almighty God Amen that
[45:58] when somebody comes in with sin in their
[46:00] life there is a power that'll cast it
[46:02] out when sickness comes in there's a
[46:05] power that'll cast it out amen
[46:09] hallelujah that's what I want to speak
[46:11] to you on is our commission but I want
[46:13] to en titled it we are still here the
[46:15] mission is still
[46:17] on Amen I I got this from a thought I I
[46:21] was doing some study on commissions and
[46:23] things and of course our Armed Forces
[46:26] they deal with commissions quite every
[46:28] day but there's an elite group of of our
[46:31] Armed Forces is called the Navy Seals
[46:33] and and I got to studying a lot of that
[46:36] and and and their and their their will
[46:37] and testament and their their mission
[46:40] statements and things and I I thought it
[46:41] was quite interesting because I I
[46:43] believe we're also a people of the seals
[46:45] amen people of the open book amen you
[46:48] know I was reading this one seal he said
[46:50] deprived of support in our environment
[46:53] and the support of our own bodies the
[46:56] only thing propping us up was our belief
[46:59] to accomplish the mission the belief to
[47:02] accomplish the mission he said when the
[47:05] mission seemed impossible it was the
[47:07] strength of our belief that made it
[47:12] possible come on somebody the absence of
[47:16] this belief guarantees
[47:18] failure he said a strong belief in the
[47:21] mission fuels our ability to focus and
[47:24] to put forth effort e and to persist
[47:27] believing allows us to see the
[47:30] goal he said a seals belief is
[47:33] accomplishing the mission it transcend
[47:36] transcends environmental or physical
[47:39] obstacles that threaten to make him fail
[47:41] often we think we're indestructible
[47:43] forever the Optimus even when we're
[47:46] outnumbered and outgun we tend to think
[47:49] we have a chance to make it out alive
[47:51] and be home in time for
[47:54] dinner come on on somebody amen listen
[47:58] our mission is not determined it just
[48:01] has nothing to do with our obstacles
[48:03] that we face or are the circumstances
[48:05] that we face no we have a mission to
[48:08] fulfill amen we have a promise to reach
[48:11] we have a body change to take come on
[48:14] now it doesn't matter what I feel like
[48:16] it or not it has nothing to do with it
[48:19] it doesn't matter if I feel like if I
[48:22] feel like I'm a Christian or if on my
[48:24] worst days I'm a child of God on my best
[48:27] days I'm a Child of God what I'm going
[48:31] through and who I am does not determine
[48:33] who I am or who he
[48:35] [Applause]
[48:39] is
[48:40] amen he says I wouldn't want to
[48:44] die in a cage of
[48:47] starvation
[48:49] amen amen or have my head cut off for
[48:52] some video to be shown around the world
[48:55] on the interet internet my attitude is
[48:58] that if the enemy wants to kill me
[49:00] they're going to have to kill me now our
[49:03] missions are
[49:07] voluntary come on now I can't think of a
[49:10] mission that wasn't ours is an Unwritten
[49:13] code it's better to burn out than fade
[49:16] away that's right I heard the prophet of
[49:18] God say the same thing better to wear
[49:20] out than rust out right amen it's better
[49:23] to burn out than fade away with our Last
[49:26] Breath we we we will take as many of the
[49:30] enemy with us as
[49:33] possible come on Hallelujah I'm not
[49:36] talking about some Navy SEAL now I'm
[49:39] talking about a child of God I thought
[49:42] my if a man could have such a drive in
[49:44] him and so be so so so moved by by what
[49:48] he's been taught and what he's learned
[49:50] amen from a government that's corrupt
[49:52] and and a gr government that does all
[49:54] kinds of things how much more should a
[49:56] child of God have such a passion inside
[49:59] of them to fulfill the commission that's
[50:02] been given in this
[50:04] day amen in my name they shall cast out
[50:08] Devils amen I don't want to die in some
[50:11] cage of starvation and be caged up and
[50:14] caged like a bird brother bradam Saw an
[50:16] Eagle that was caged away when he was
[50:18] destined to be flying in the heavenlies

[50:31] that cage of doubt and unbelief you have
[50:34] the rights to walk out of
[50:37] it that's right amen my head ain't going
[50:41] to be on the platter down in Hell's
[50:44] television look who gave up this
[50:46] time look who walked away this time no
[50:50] that's not where I'm going to be no if I
[50:53] die I'm going to die killing as many
[50:55] enemies that I can
[50:56] kill amen you know I I I was actually
[51:00] looking into these things and I ran
[51:02] across a man he's known now as the Lone
[51:06] Survivor and and his name is Marcus
[51:08] Latrell yeah they made a movie out of
[51:11] him wrote books hadn't really looked I
[51:13] hadn't watched that or or read in his
[51:15] books but just read some excerpts of his
[51:18] story and heard him tell it on on
[51:20] YouTube I believe as I was studying this
[51:23] been several years ago but he was a man
[51:26] with three other three other Compadres
[51:28] that were dropped off in Afghanistan and
[51:30] they were under a mission to go take out
[51:32] a certain terrist and and they were
[51:34] looking for him and and they were under
[51:36] surveillance and and they were on the
[51:38] mountains they hiding during the day and
[51:41] going out at night and looking and
[51:42] trying to find this
[51:44] one and and you know uh they came across
[51:47] uh I bumped into some uh goat herders
[51:51] and and they bumped into them and they
[51:53] knew when they did they they they they
[51:55] knew that their position was
[51:57] compromised so they they had wanted to
[52:00] they didn't know what to do they they
[52:02] didn't know if they should take take
[52:03] them out or or they should tie them up
[52:05] or or what they should do so they voted
[52:07] or done come up the leader decided
[52:09] they'd let them go but they knew that
[52:12] they they very well could give away
[52:13] their position and within an hour they
[52:15] were under extreme gunfire and mortar
[52:18] reals and and and and it was actually
[52:20] one of the deadliest days for the seals
[52:22] a and so uh cuz there was others that
[52:24] come in to try to SA sa them and they
[52:25] shot them out of the air but here here
[52:27] they were because they allowed what
[52:30] seemed to be very innocent to
[52:33] live amen you know that little
[52:35] Philistine one day is going to go up to
[52:37] be a big
[52:38] Philistine amen they might look like a
[52:41] peacekeeper or peaceful they might look
[52:43] very Innocent but they don't have your
[52:45] best interest at
[52:47] heart amen and they're very quickly amen
[52:50] was telling where where he was and and
[52:52] they find themselves and he finds
[52:54] himself like after I don't know how many
[52:56] hours of fighting for against the just
[52:59] seemed like hund Talib ban Fighters and
[53:02] three three of them were killed and he's
[53:04] he's laid into a into a tree and he's
[53:07] he's actually bit his tongue in half and
[53:08] he's shot and he's he's paralyzed from
[53:11] the waist down and and I just want to
[53:13] pick up a
[53:14] story as he as as he tells it his nose
[53:17] was broken he was shoved inside of his
[53:19] face he bit half his tongue off and spit
[53:22] it out of his
[53:23] mouth he was paralyzed from the waist
[53:26] down he had crawled into a ravine after
[53:29] hours of fighting and watching the sun
[53:31] go down he thought his life would just
[53:33] fade away he said I was in bad shape I
[53:37] was dying I didn't know what to do I was
[53:40] laying there in this tree looking at the
[53:42] moon he said I begin to feel sorry for
[53:45] myself my brother a Navy SEAL to a twin
[53:48] brother and I was thinking of him and my
[53:50] teammates and all the training we had
[53:51] been through and I laid there and I was
[53:53] like get up and let's
[53:56] go that's what I said what what what was
[53:59] I going to do laying there and die I
[54:01] wasn't going to do that I definitely
[54:03] wasn't going to feel sorry for myself I
[54:05] kept thinking okay I'm alive I'm alive I
[54:09] had men that were beside me they fought
[54:11] and died I'm still alive so the mission
[54:14] is still on all
[54:16] right the mission is still on let's go
[54:20] and so I reached out and I grabbed a
[54:22] rock and I reached out as far as I could
[54:24] and I drew a line in the dirt in front
[54:26] of me and I'm like I'm going to crawl
[54:28] till my feet hit that and if I'm still
[54:31] alive when I get on the other side of
[54:33] that line I'm going to draw a line again
[54:35] and when I did that I drew a line and I
[54:38] crawled to my feet hit it and I fell
[54:40] down a hill and I crawled up another
[54:42] Hill and I drew another line and I did
[54:45] that for seven miles
[54:48] wow and he said somebody was like well
[54:51] why didn't you quit that was not an
[54:54] option
[54:56] Hallelujah that was not an option that's
[54:59] who I
[55:00] am basically I'm not ever going to stop
[55:04] ever period until you take my breath
[55:07] away and you strip everything away
[55:10] that's how I am
[55:11] trained that's how we are trained from
[55:14] the day we go into training they take
[55:16] everything that you are and everything
[55:18] you wanted to be and they mold you back
[55:20] up to what they want you to
[55:23] be I thought that exactly what happens
[55:26] to a child of God you wonder how you
[55:28] still got strength you wonder how you
[55:30] still can go you wonder how you can make
[55:33] another step because he took you and

[55:41] you maybe some of you find yourself
[55:43] blown apart this this evening you're on
[55:46] the verge of giving up why don't you
[55:48] grab a promise come on come on grab a
[55:51] rock and draw your line and drag your
[55:54] body across it and draw another line
[55:57] let's draw it till we get on the other
[56:01] side cuz we are not quitters we are not
[56:04] quitters we have been given a commission
[56:07] and we will destroy the works of the
[56:10] devil we are still here the mission is

[1:03:20] this the Christ and the true
[1:03:23] church
[1:03:24] is a
[1:03:26] continuation of the book of
[1:03:29] Acts in my book of Acts I say healings
[1:03:32] take place raising the dead take
[1:03:36] place you say well I see a lot of
[1:03:38] fussing going on there the book of Acts
[1:03:40] is the acts of the Holy Ghost that's
[1:03:43] what that book's about this is what we
[1:03:45] are to continue is the continuation the
[1:03:48] spirit of God moving in our lives moving
[1:03:51] in our
[1:03:52] churches come on somebody

[1:03:56] moving in this
[1:03:58] Temple amen moving in our lives not just

[1:04:16] you tonight to grab a hold of one
[1:04:19] promise and draw a line and say devil
[1:04:22] I'm coming across that line
[1:04:30] The Book of Revelation shows how that
[1:04:32] Antichrist Spirit would come into the
[1:04:35] church and defile it and make it
[1:04:38] lukewarm formal and Powerless it expose
[1:04:42] we know this quote it exposes Satan
[1:04:44] revealing his works the attempted
[1:04:48] destruction I love hey the attempted
[1:04:50] destruction of God's people and the
[1:04:52] discrediting of God's word right down to
[1:04:54] the time he's casting the Lake of Fire
[1:04:56] he fights that he can't stand it he
[1:04:58] knows that if the people get the true
[1:05:00] revelation of this true church and what
[1:05:03] she is and what she stands for that she
[1:05:06] can do the Greater Works she will be an
[1:05:08] invincible
[1:05:10] Army she will be an invincible Army

[1:05:18] invincible Army that's what this Navy SE
[1:05:21] we almost feel
[1:05:23] indestructible amen because of what has
[1:05:25] been put inside of them such a belief to
[1:05:28] believe a Creed of an evil
[1:05:31] government Amen to do the missions of an
[1:05:34] evil
[1:05:35] cment it's what it is an evil cment that
[1:05:38] Satan controls and they do it with
[1:05:41] passion they do it with Git they do it
[1:05:43] they're going to they're not going to
[1:05:44] fail you have to take the life out of me
[1:05:46] that's the only way I'm
[1:05:48] quitting and they do it like that under
[1:05:51] those those those under that
[1:05:53] understanding in and here we are on the
[1:05:55] other side amen a true
[1:05:59] church with a true commission from the
[1:06:02] kingdom of almighty God how much more
[1:06:04] should we

[1:06:37] evening that's got enough passion inside
[1:06:40] of them that'll begin to grab a hold of
[1:06:42] a promise and begin to fight their way
[1:06:44] towards that devil that's got somebody
[1:06:47] caged

[1:06:52] Creed I'm going to guard amen my friends

[1:07:25] discern and
[1:07:28] withstand not just see it but withstand
[1:07:31] it that means stand up against
[1:07:35] it that means take a stand Satan will be
[1:07:39] powerless before her he will be as
[1:07:42] definitely thwarted or defeated today as
[1:07:44] when Christ with stood his every effort
[1:07:46] to gain power of him the desert yes
[1:07:49] Satan hates Revelation but we love it
[1:07:51] with true Revelation in our lives the

[1:09:06] already done it's already
[1:09:09] finished sir I've used this before and
[1:09:12] I'll use it again but Timothy said in
[1:09:14] the last days perilous time shall come
[1:09:17] the last days for
[1:09:21] who we get all nervous about that and we
[1:09:23] see it it is the last days it is the
[1:09:26] last moments of time but it's not my
[1:09:28] last days no no this is only my

[1:10:07] Fire you're going to be shouting on the
[1:10:08] Hills of
[1:10:10] Glory I say let's get the party started
[1:10:14] this is not my last day this is my
[1:10:17] beginning I'm just about to step from
[1:10:20] time into
[1:10:22] eternity
[1:10:26] [Applause]
[1:10:30] Hallelujah your enemy has an expiration
[1:10:35] date and him knowing that he knows he
[1:10:38] has such a a short time and still he
[1:10:43] fights he must believe in what he's
[1:10:48] doing you know why people give up
[1:10:50] because they stop
[1:10:52] believing amen if this man would have
[1:10:55] stopped believing in his mission he'd
[1:10:57] been laying dead somewhere and they had
[1:10:58] to go get him but maybe burn up in the
[1:11:01] fire I don't know what would have
[1:11:02] happened to him but there was something
[1:11:04] that was instilled in him through his
[1:11:07] training through what he had been
[1:11:10] through listen God doesn't waste a
[1:11:13] battle in every battle he is preparing
[1:11:16] you for the
[1:11:18] next brother Timothy I don't like
[1:11:20] hearing that well that's just the way it
[1:11:22] is we're not Millennium yet there going
[1:11:25] to be one trial to the next trial to the
[1:11:27] next
[1:11:29] trial Hey listen we're not the only ones
[1:11:31] though that deal with depression and
[1:11:33] suicide and spirits of every kind the
[1:11:36] whole world deals with them that's right
[1:11:39] at least we have a
[1:11:41] hope at least we have something that we
[1:11:43] can lean upon in our times of trials in
[1:11:46] the darkness that comes around us and
[1:11:49] all we can look up and see a few Stars
[1:11:51] yet there's something on the inside of
[1:11:53] us said I'm not giving
[1:11:56] up I'm not quitting I I hadn't been to
[1:11:59] church in a while I I've went on the
[1:12:00] sidelines somewhere but there's
[1:12:02] something still on the inside of
[1:12:05] me I can look back and I can say oh my
[1:12:08] life he's been
[1:12:10] faithful through church trouble he's
[1:12:12] been faithful through church splits He's
[1:12:14] been Faithful though preachers walked
[1:12:17] away he's still
[1:12:18] faithful come on somebody though all
[1:12:21] walk away he's still God
[1:12:25] [Applause]
[1:12:32] this is where you got to come to you're
[1:12:33] going to go through times you're going
[1:12:35] to go through Wilderness Jesus
[1:12:39] did he was our commanding
[1:12:43] officer he would not give you a
[1:12:45] commission that he would not do
[1:12:48] himself matter of fact he's been tempted
[1:12:50] in all
[1:12:52] things what the Bible says he's went
[1:12:55] through it all you know this I don't
[1:12:58] know where this story come from brother
[1:13:00] Danny where brother Danny steon had told
[1:13:02] me about it and I hope I can get it as
[1:13:05] correct as possible because it's very
[1:13:08] profound it was a man that was dealing
[1:13:11] with a homosexual spirit and he went to
[1:13:13] his pastor and he began to talk to him
[1:13:15] and finally he looked at his Pastor he
[1:13:17] said he said I look Pastor you can't
[1:13:19] help me he said I you you ain't never
[1:13:22] dealt with this you
[1:13:24] you you don't you know what you don't
[1:13:25] know what it's like to deal with what
[1:13:26] I'm going through I I don't know why i'
[1:13:28] come he said I don't know what to and
[1:13:30] said the P just kind of bowed his head
[1:13:32] and didn't really know what to say and
[1:13:35] he hears a voice speak to him and says
[1:13:36] you tell him I
[1:13:41] did he was tempted in all
[1:13:46] things he went through it
[1:13:48] all therefore he would not commission
[1:13:51] you to go something through something
[1:13:53] that he hadn't already went through and
[1:13:56] showed it can be defeated showed it can
[1:14:00] be overcome showed you can rise above it
[1:14:04] sir Jesus went through church
[1:14:08] Blitz he had friends walk away from him
[1:14:12] his own family denied him he went
[1:14:15] through it
[1:14:17] all yes sir
[1:14:20] amen I'm just so broken brother Timothy
[1:14:23] well if you allow it allow God to use it
[1:14:25] he can use that
[1:14:28] Brokenness this is another sermon but I
[1:14:31] I was just doing some research on on on
[1:14:34] Brokenness and just and and and studying
[1:14:36] on ashamed being broken and ashamed and
[1:14:40] I come across this technique they do in
[1:14:42] Japan it's called tusuy or something
[1:14:45] like that not very good in Japanese not
[1:14:47] very
[1:14:49] fluent and so that's the English version
[1:14:51] of what they do but anyway it's a it's a
[1:14:55] a technique that if you're walking
[1:14:56] across your kitchen so or somewhere and
[1:14:58] you got your grandma that's or dish has
[1:15:00] been passed down through generations
[1:15:02] beautiful pottery and you got it in your
[1:15:04] hand and and you're very trying to be
[1:15:06] very careful because it's been passed
[1:15:08] down it's worth a lot of money antiques
[1:15:10] you know whatever and you stumble
[1:15:12] against something that falls out of your
[1:15:13] hand and crashes into pieces you know
[1:15:15] they don't go take that pottery and
[1:15:17] sweep it all up and throw it in the
[1:15:19] trash a lot of us do that we've done
[1:15:21] that many times you know well I can't do
[1:15:22] none of that broke but they actually
[1:15:25] take that and they gather up all those
[1:15:26] pieces and they begin to put that
[1:15:29] Pottery together you know what they use
[1:15:31] by the Jason they use gold and they take
[1:15:34] gold and they line this cracks of this
[1:15:36] vessel and actually they say Amen the
[1:15:39] value is greater now than it was
[1:15:43] before because of the gold that's placed
[1:15:46] on them cracks and it's now a beautiful
[1:15:49] vessel and it's one of a kind you can't
[1:15:51] get another one like it
[1:15:54] come on somebody we're all one of a kind

[1:17:46] while we're on this Pottery brother Matt
[1:17:48] Morris was just at our church and he was
[1:17:49] ministering over there in India and and
[1:17:52] he was they was going down to the river
[1:17:54] to baptize some people and he was
[1:17:56] sitting on the bank there as they was as
[1:17:58] they went down he's looking around
[1:17:59] there's all this pottery and he sees one
[1:18:01] piece that was that was that was still
[1:18:04] pretty much all there and he said that'd
[1:18:06] be kind of nice to take home they throw
[1:18:08] it away he said I'll just take it home
[1:18:09] and the brother's like oh no brother
[1:18:10] don't do that said those those things
[1:18:13] were one time they were there were
[1:18:15] dishes that they used to worship
[1:18:17] idols and he got to looking at that
[1:18:20] piece of pottery and looking at that
[1:18:21] water looking at that piece of pottery
[1:18:23] and look in that water he said do you
[1:18:25] not realize what is taking place here
[1:18:28] we're taking vessels down in that water
[1:18:30] that once were vessels of idolatry once
[1:18:34] served a dead God but they're going to
[1:18:36] be buried in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:18:39] Christ to be raised up in the
[1:18:40] resurrected
[1:18:43] power he said this is a sign that God
[1:18:46] can take what's wrong and what's tore up
[1:18:49] and what's messed up and what's thrown
[1:18:51] in the Heap pile and bring it out of
[1:18:53] there and make it a vessel of
[1:18:56] [Applause]
[1:19:00] honor to God Jesus was led up by the
[1:19:03] spirit in the wilderness to be tempted
[1:19:05] of the devil when it fasted 40 days and
[1:19:07] 40 nights and the tempter came to him
[1:19:09] this is Matthew 4 and: three said if
[1:19:12] thou be the Son of
[1:19:16] God if thou be command these stones to
[1:19:19] be made to bread and he answered and
[1:19:21] said it is written
[1:19:23] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[1:19:25] every word that proceedeth out of the
[1:19:26] mouth of God then the devil take him up
[1:19:29] the holy city set him on the Pinnacle of
[1:19:30] the temple and say to them if thou
[1:19:32] notice all the questions
[1:19:35] yes the devil likes to throw up a lot of
[1:19:37] questions if thou be if you're really an
[1:19:40] overcomer if this Jesus said Thou shalt
[1:19:43] not tempt the Lord thy God the devil
[1:19:45] take him up to exceeding high mountain
[1:19:47] and showeth them all the kingdoms of the
[1:19:48] world and the glory of them and say to
[1:19:50] them all these things will I give to
[1:19:52] thee if if thou wil Fall Down and
[1:19:54] Worship me and Jesus said get thee hence
[1:19:57] Satan for it is written Thou shalt
[1:19:59] Worship the Lord thy God and him only sh
[1:20:03] shall thou serve see he see the word of
[1:20:05] God will defeat Satan
[1:20:10] anywhere anywhere Jesus said all of his
[1:20:13] fine qualities the father had given to
[1:20:15] me but he's he with all those fine
[1:20:17] qualities he said it is written when he
[1:20:19] met Satan he defeated him right there on
[1:20:22] the word of God God brought it down to a
[1:20:24] place that
[1:20:26] anybody the weakest of
[1:20:29] Christians the weakest of Christians can
[1:20:32] defeat Satan on the word of God you will
[1:20:36] not defeat him on your
[1:20:38] feelings you will not defeat him on your
[1:20:41] circumstances you will not defeat him in
[1:20:44] the things around you but you can defeat
[1:20:46] him if you stand on the
[1:20:51] word amen so if we have to have a word
[1:20:55] to stand on it's got to be a word that
[1:20:56] never fails because if it's a word that
[1:20:58] fails you can't stand on something
[1:21:00] that's shaking and moving and it's got
[1:21:02] to be a firm foundation so God gives us
[1:21:05] a word and he keeps his word no matter
[1:21:07] how unreasonable it may seem to a people
[1:21:10] God will always keep his
[1:21:13] word hallelujah that's why if you got
[1:21:15] children that are lost you need to put
[1:21:17] that word before you they shall be there
[1:21:20] and their offspring with them
[1:21:24] the promises unto you and your
[1:21:26] children that's how you defeat him when
[1:21:28] he comes if if they were really Sons or
[1:21:31] if they were really daughters they
[1:21:33] wouldn't be out
[1:21:35] there well if you they weren why are you
[1:21:38] so worried about them
[1:21:40] devil amen why are you worrying me about
[1:21:43] them if you think they're that's not who
[1:21:44] they are but you know there's got to be
[1:21:46] something on the
[1:21:48] inside and the devil gets nervous cuz he
[1:21:51] knows his time is short
[1:21:54] he's only got just a certain time he can
[1:21:57] keep your
[1:21:59] children come on now he's only got a
[1:22:02] certain time he can keep you in the
[1:22:04] place that you are but there's a word
[1:22:06] for your
[1:22:08] deliverance and there's a spirit that'll
[1:22:11] follow that word and break the chains
[1:22:13] off of
[1:22:14] [Applause]
[1:22:16] lives
[1:22:19] Hallelujah God's word is infinite he
[1:22:22] knows all the future from the beginning
[1:22:24] and he doesn't make a promise L he knows
[1:22:27] it's going to
[1:22:29] happen Hallelujah I love a word like
[1:22:32] that my word may fail your word may fail
[1:22:35] but his word never has failed not one
[1:22:39] time not one time is it failed he said
[1:22:42] you know how strange that people might
[1:22:44] have thought of in the days of Noah when
[1:22:46] he was building away at the ark to save
[1:22:47] himself and his household there's going
[1:22:49] to be rain come down of Heavens but it
[1:22:52] didn't matter matter what they thought
[1:22:53] God reigned it just the same they had
[1:22:55] scientific proof they had it had never
[1:22:58] Noah what are you doing well I'm
[1:22:59] building Arc for what it's going to rain
[1:23:01] rain what is
[1:23:03] that what is it's going to fall from the
[1:23:06] heavens and it's going to come up from
[1:23:08] the earth and he's going to flood this
[1:23:09] place no you done lost your mind we got
[1:23:12] instruments we sent up there and there's
[1:23:14] no rain there never has been let me look
[1:23:16] back since the beginning of
[1:23:18] time what God Said is going to rain so
[1:23:22] he just kept putting another nail in the
[1:23:24] ark listen critics are going to
[1:23:27] critic unbelievers are going to
[1:23:31] unbelieve no matter how much you try to
[1:23:33] argue with them no matter how much you
[1:23:34] try to show them that's who they are but
[1:23:38] a Believer he's going to
[1:23:40] believe it's who we are we have a belief
[1:23:44] in our commission therefore we going to
[1:23:46] fulfill
[1:23:49] it and if a devil happens to step up and
[1:23:52] our way we're going to cast him out and
[1:23:55] if sickness Ares we're going to lay
[1:23:57] hands on it and it's going to
[1:24:02] go cuz it's his word and I can stand on
[1:24:06] his
[1:24:10] word he says I think about Moses
[1:24:13] standing up there on the side of the
[1:24:14] mountain looking at that burning bush he
[1:24:16] had lost all hopes of
[1:24:18] Freedom listen to this he had lost all
[1:24:21] hopes of Freedom this seem like the
[1:24:23] freedom that the people he so Gallant
[1:24:25] stood for one time was ever going to
[1:24:27] happen been 40 years since he tried but
[1:24:31] in the light of God standing by that
[1:24:33] burning bush everything in him
[1:24:38] changed Hallelujah he said I think it's
[1:24:40] the same today that many of us lose the
[1:24:43] sight of freedom I think as a little boy
[1:24:46] sitting here maybe INF infant uh
[1:24:48] infantile paralysis little arms twisted
[1:24:51] up lady with a white can maybe a blind
[1:24:53] woman lovely young lady on the C maybe
[1:24:55] cancer heart trouble or diseases maybe
[1:24:57] it's going to kill you you lose all
[1:25:00] thoughts of Freedom as soon as a doctor
[1:25:02] says it's
[1:25:06] incurable but let me say this with God
[1:25:08] there's not no such a thing as an
[1:25:11] incurable
[1:25:13] disease it doesn't matter what the
[1:25:16] doctor say it doesn't matter what
[1:25:17] monitors say it doesn't matter what test
[1:25:20] say it only matters what God
[1:25:30] says he said that's the reason he said I
[1:25:33] think men and women today would would
[1:25:35] they would ever step into the light of
[1:25:38] the Holy Spirit and under the unction of
[1:25:40] God's spirit the light of God's word
[1:25:42] everything that God promised will
[1:25:45] illuminate to you and be real
[1:25:48] again again be real again amen Maybe
[1:25:52] we've lost the realness step into the
[1:25:54] light of his word and let it become real
[1:25:58] again he said I I that's the reason
[1:26:01] Moses failed in the first place here's
[1:26:03] what's the matter it was the lack of
[1:26:05] having what the burning bush had
[1:26:09] amen what our failure today is the lack
[1:26:12] of having what the Holy Spirit has the
[1:26:14] Holy Spirit has all good things for us
[1:26:17] there he goes again all all good things
[1:26:19] for us and if we receive the Holy Spirit
[1:26:21] then all somebody say all all things are
[1:26:24] possible not only possible but
[1:26:29] promt my God Jesus said ask the father
[1:26:32] anything in my name and I will do it if
[1:26:35] you abide in me and my words abide in
[1:26:37] you ask what you will and it'll be given
[1:26:39] to you see when we step into the light
[1:26:41] of God's word with the unction of the
[1:26:43] Holy Spirit to shine a light on it
[1:26:45] brother The Impossible becomes a little
[1:26:48] thing
[1:26:50] then hallelujah amen I love how God
[1:26:54] magnifies things he makes what we think
[1:26:56] big into little
[1:27:00] things come on sometimes you needed to
[1:27:02] change your
[1:27:05] perspective get up a little
[1:27:07] higher amen I remember when I first went
[1:27:10] to South Africa I was walking down them
[1:27:11] streets and them big tall buildings I
[1:27:13] thought wow this is amazing you know I'm
[1:27:15] a city boy we tall his thing we got a
[1:27:16] pine tree or a country boy tallest thing
[1:27:19] I got a pine tree it's pretty tall but
[1:27:20] it ain't nothing like them skyscrapers
[1:27:22] thought wow this is amazing next day I'm
[1:27:24] up on top of one of them eating dinner
[1:27:27] and I'm looking down like wow them
[1:27:28] people look little the next day I was up
[1:27:31] on Table Rock and I was looking down on
[1:27:35] that on that restaurant down on the city
[1:27:38] and you could barely make out where I
[1:27:39] was standing just see little little
[1:27:42] little things walking
[1:27:44] around and a few more days later I was
[1:27:47] in an airplane and I went over Table
[1:27:49] Rock and I looked down and Table Rock
[1:27:52] look
[1:27:55] small see what you're looking at depends
[1:27:58] on where you're at what you're really
[1:28:00] seeing depends on what you're at if
[1:28:02] you're in the world the things of the
[1:28:05] devil looks huge it looks impossible it
[1:28:07] looks like I'll never overcome but if
[1:28:09] you get in the light of God's word
[1:28:11] you'll realize it's a little
[1:28:14] thing amen it's a little thing to
[1:28:16] overcome smoking and drinking and drugs
[1:28:19] it's a little thing in the presence of
[1:28:21] almighty God I've seen him in a moment
[1:28:23] take it all
[1:28:25] [Applause]
[1:28:30] away and getting a astronaut getting a
[1:28:33] rocket things really begin to look small
[1:28:36] this big old world and all our worries
[1:28:38] and all our frustration ain't a person
[1:28:41] sitting on top of a rocket worried about
[1:28:43] anything that's going on in this world I
[1:28:45] got to thinking about that when we was
[1:28:46] in the middle of 2020 and Co and then we
[1:28:49] got all the riots that were happening in
[1:28:50] the middle of that they shot a rock it
[1:28:52] off I thought I bet them two guys
[1:28:54] sitting on there they ain't worried
[1:28:56] about Co they ain't worried ain't
[1:28:59] looking over I wonder what they're doing
[1:29:00] over there in Minneapolis or wherever
[1:29:01] what riding and this at Chicago New
[1:29:04] York's
[1:29:05] whatever I no their eyes was on
[1:29:08] something
[1:29:10] different their position had
[1:29:13] changed maybe the day before they was
[1:29:15] reading all about it but today they're
[1:29:17] looking to go into another atmosphere
[1:29:19] all
[1:29:20] right maybe before these meetings you
[1:29:23] was reading all about it you thought it
[1:29:25] was impossible to overcome that thing
[1:29:27] you thought it was impossible to ever
[1:29:29] see your family serving God but maybe
[1:29:31] you got on the top of a rocket and you
[1:29:33] started looking up look up your
[1:29:35] Redemption draw now and you started
[1:29:37] looking into another
[1:29:41] realm and what was big becomes a little
[1:29:50] thing God God asked us to believe his
[1:29:53] word therefore he sends his holy spirit
[1:29:55] to energize that word when he falls into
[1:29:58] it he said when the word's being
[1:30:00] preached and the Holy Spirit brings the
[1:30:02] word he energizes that and flashes the
[1:30:04] same light of God's blessed promise God
[1:30:08] said I have remembered my promise to
[1:30:10] Abraham Isaac and Jacob and I'm sending
[1:30:12] you down there to do it and when God's
[1:30:14] word and promise becomes enlightened by
[1:30:16] the presence of the Angel of the Lord
[1:30:18] Stop Moses now if you
[1:30:20] can oh
[1:30:23] my yeah he's on his road cuz God always
[1:30:27] keeps his
[1:30:29] promises yes sir I thought this pretty
[1:30:32] amazing last night brother Jason ended
[1:30:34] this on on the on the Arrow of God's
[1:30:36] Deliverance it was a king that was given
[1:30:38] a
[1:30:39] commission strike the ground amen he
[1:30:42] told to shoot a bow and he was told to
[1:30:44] strike a ground and we know what he did
[1:30:45] he just took little three little
[1:30:46] laxidasical hits at it and he
[1:30:50] quit that was as far as he could go with
[1:30:53] what he believed God could
[1:30:55] do some people in strike the ground till
[1:30:58] they get to justification and as far as
[1:31:00] they go sanctification that's as far as
[1:31:02] they go but listen God wants to take us
[1:31:04] all the
[1:31:05] way amen we strike the ground enough to
[1:31:08] get our healing or or get a little
[1:31:10] Deliverance but we still live with other
[1:31:12] things and we allow Satan to bombard our
[1:31:14] mind and bombard our houses and bombard
[1:31:17] our children he wants you to take the
[1:31:19] arrow of God's Deliverance and going to
[1:31:22] strik in that ground until your enemy is
[1:31:27] gone if I can get somebody here tonight
[1:31:30] to believe the commission enough to grab
[1:31:32] an
[1:31:34] [Applause]
[1:31:35] arrow devil I have had enough of you you
[1:31:38] have come on my territory one too many

[1:31:55] for a woman that had cancer in her body
[1:31:58] and the doctors were taking her the next
[1:31:59] morning or maybe that day to to have
[1:32:02] operation and dad asked her she's laying
[1:32:04] there in that cancer riddle body and
[1:32:06] said what do you want me to do sister

[1:32:27] sword of the
[1:32:29] word the commission that God gave us and
[1:32:32] we laid hands upon the sick and they
[1:32:35] shall recover and that cancer ain't a
[1:32:37] sickness is a
[1:32:39] devil it's a name that the that the
[1:32:41] doctors give to it but we know what the
[1:32:43] eagle said he said it's a
[1:32:46] spirit and it come in that body in a
[1:32:49] body that was given unto God and it
[1:32:51] wasn't his possession to begin
[1:32:54] with Hallelujah we took our commission

[1:32:59] faith and she went into the operation
[1:33:01] room they opened her up they said there
[1:33:03] ain't no cancer
[1:33:06] here hallelujah he's still the same

[1:39:12] we I go to sit with her and talk with
[1:39:14] her cuz I want to see her hoping she'll
[1:39:17] get out of the hospital before I leave
[1:39:18] and and uh I I just began to sing to her
[1:39:22] begin to sing songs just cuz she was
[1:39:24] real uptight and nervous and she knew
[1:39:26] something wasn't right but she didn't
[1:39:27] know what you could tell her spirit was
[1:39:29] just tore up so I remember what David
[1:39:32] would do he would just sing so I began
[1:39:34] to sing and I I'd sing Oh only believe
[1:39:37] and she would sing along with me oh and
[1:39:39] lift her hand and they say you know it
[1:39:41] just settle right down and you could see
[1:39:43] her almost just come to herself and then
[1:39:46] we then we stop for a minute just come
[1:39:47] all over again I just begin to sing
[1:39:49] again about the second of song long or
[1:39:51] so she she looks at me and she said are
[1:39:53] you preaching tomorrow night she didn't
[1:39:55] know what day it was as far as I knew
[1:39:57] saides ma'am I am she said I'm going to
[1:39:59] be there so well praise the Lord did
[1:40:02] look like it did it didn't look like it
[1:40:03] was no way she was going to be there the
[1:40:04] next morning they dismissed
[1:40:07] her and she shows up at
[1:40:10] church she loved to go to
[1:40:12] church and she was a Godly woman and and
[1:40:16] and stilled a lot of Godly principles in
[1:40:18] US children but you know I I I thought
[1:40:20] well surely you know God's moving you
[1:40:22] you're looking for every sign you're
[1:40:23] looking for everything you're you know
[1:40:25] you're just you're believing you're
[1:40:26] pushing it out you just keep going
[1:40:29] forward so she had to go back in the
[1:40:31] next morning as we flew out just for
[1:40:33] some tests and they didn't find anything
[1:40:34] let her go and so I go to brother Ron's
[1:40:36] and and I'm just praying and just asking
[1:40:39] God God be merciful you and it just
[1:40:41] burden and I'm just God I need an answer
[1:40:43] I I want an answer I I know you answer
[1:40:46] and I begin to study on a God that
[1:40:47] answers and I begin to see what brother
[1:40:49] brand said God always always answers he
[1:40:51] said many times it's in an unexpected
[1:40:53] way at an unexpected time and an
[1:40:55] unexpected place he said but you just
[1:40:57] need to realize that when he speaks he
[1:40:59] answers may not be what you expect may
[1:41:01] not be what you're looking for but he
[1:41:04] answers so I get up that that Sunday
[1:41:06] morning and I begin to preach that
[1:41:08] thought on the god at answers and I'm
[1:41:10] here looking for an answer and I'm
[1:41:11] praying for an answer and I'm asking God
[1:41:14] God I need to see you visibly I need to
[1:41:16] know I I need to know that you're here
[1:41:18] and you're see you're moving in this
[1:41:20] situation so brother Ron has a a little
[1:41:22] pull pit part or platform part that goes
[1:41:24] out in front of his his pull pit and I

[1:50:41] of houses and she didn't have to touch
[1:50:44] one of them but because of what she was
[1:50:47] projecting she had reached in M oh oh
[1:50:50] God she had reached into another real
[1:50:53] and she was drawing energy and power
[1:50:55] from that realm and it was drawing
[1:50:56] people back to
[1:50:58] her we actually got a lady right now in

[2:00:08] unimportant is direct quote how
[2:00:11] unimportant you are you are here to
[2:00:13] serve a
[2:00:15] purpose just as my finger is here for a
[2:00:17] purpose the nail of fingers for a
[2:00:19] purpose my eye and every part of our
[2:00:22] bodies is to serve a purpose seen or
[2:00:25] unseen yes
[2:00:28] am some of them unseen parts are way
[2:00:31] more important than the seen Parts
[2:00:33] prayer warriors are very
[2:00:35] important for a
[2:00:36] church amen people that say are
[2:00:39] supporting is very important you may not
[2:00:41] ever be on the
[2:00:42] camera Lord knows I don't want to be on
[2:00:44] the
[2:00:45] camera don't understand anybody who does
[2:00:48] want to be on the camera
[2:00:52] but the Unseen parts are very very
[2:00:56] important even things that the doctors
[2:00:58] don't even know are important you got
[2:01:01] parts of your body they can cut out and
[2:01:02] you can still live but God put it there
[2:01:04] for a purpose they may not know the
[2:01:06] purpose they may not understand the
[2:01:08] purpose but God didn't put it there just
[2:01:10] to see if he could put it there neither
[2:01:12] did he put you here just to see if he
[2:01:14] could put you here amen he put you here
[2:01:17] for a purpose amen and so if you know
[2:01:20] that you're here for a purpose then
[2:01:21] there is nothing that can destroy us
[2:01:23] until God's purpose is fulfilled nothing
[2:01:26] can harm us into that purpose that God
[2:01:28] has put us here has been made manifest
[2:01:31] no matter how much trouble we have how
[2:01:33] many heartaches Sorrows whatever we go
[2:01:36] through all of those are for
[2:01:40] reasons there is a reason for it amen
[2:01:44] yes but it's all for a purpose all
[2:01:47] powers of Hell might raise against it
[2:01:49] but this bride will prevail we have
[2:01:52] God's Eternal promise oh there may be
[2:01:54] isms rise there may be programs rise
[2:01:56] there may be all kinds of things rise
[2:01:58] looks like it's going to be destroyed
[2:01:59] but it'll never be destroyed it's the
[2:02:01] purpose of God to see that it will be
[2:02:03] that it will prevail then it's not up to
[2:02:05] me it's not up to you whether to be
[2:02:07] destroyed or not it's up to God we can
[2:02:09] rest assured on it God will never let
[2:02:11] our heritage be
[2:02:14] destroyed Hallelujah for it is his
[2:02:17] purpose to give it to us
[2:02:24] Hallelujah let's bow our heads stand to
[2:02:27] our feet and bow our heads if you
[2:02:36] would we were all put here for a purpose
[2:02:40] every one of
[2:02:47] us
[2:02:53] Hallelujah he said I tell you we got to
[2:02:56] fight but we might have the most
[2:02:58] powerful weapon the devil makes fun of
[2:03:01] it and says there's no such a thing but
[2:03:03] pick up tonight and receive the Holy
[2:03:06] Ghost and defeat every devil of sin
[2:03:09] drunkenness whatever it is we got him on
[2:03:11] the run to be conquered yes and someday
[2:03:14] that Chief Captain will come and sin and
[2:03:16] sickness and sorrow will be over with

[2:28:07] years I'll still be going
[2:28:10] strong oh you are to put him in his
[2:28:12] place and just remind him you know I I
[2:28:15] remember brother how Howard Carol used
[2:28:17] to say well the devil would get on him
[2:28:19] really really hard and things would just
[2:28:21] be you know knocking left and right and
[2:28:23] brother Harold would just say all right
[2:28:25] Satan all it's all right this is your
[2:28:27] day my day is
[2:28:29] coming my day is coming Hallelujah I
[2:28:32] believe he's got an expiration date amen
[2:28:36] you know the Apostle John said in 1 John
[2:28:39] 2:15 love not the world neither the
[2:28:43] things that are in the world If any man
[2:28:47] love the world the love of the father is
[2:28:51] not in
[2:28:53] him you know Satan does a lot of things
[2:28:56] to hinder our love of God that's right
[2:28:58] yeah entices us brings all kinds of
[2:29:01] things not just to young people to old
[2:29:02] people that's right to lure your away to
[2:29:05] get in the way of that love relationship
[2:29:08] because in that love that's the greatest
[2:29:09] power on all on all the Earth that's
[2:29:12] what brother brandham said was his great
[2:29:14] secret to the supernatural that that
[2:29:17] Power of Love That Power to trust God
[2:29:21] you
[2:29:23] know something that the Lord has
[2:29:26] just made so real to me
[2:29:30] recently and we realize that you know I
[2:29:34] mean you can you can take first John
[2:29:36] 2:15 and apply it to every age oh yes
[2:29:39] it's that's always been true but the
[2:29:42] Apostle Paul when he writes to se to to
[2:29:45] Timothy in his second letter in that
[2:29:46] third chapter he starts talking about in
[2:29:49] the last days perilous times will come
[2:29:53] and Brother brandham Talks so so much in
[2:29:55] Satan's Eden God of this evil age and
[2:29:57] he's proving by the Bible that that day
[2:30:00] that Paul was talking about where Satan
[2:30:02] would be worship like God would be the
[2:30:04] day that we live in that this is
[2:30:06] perilous times not that they didn't have
[2:30:08] perilous times in every age but there
[2:30:10] would come a time where it would be so
[2:30:12] bad where Satan would be exalted as the
[2:30:16] god of the Earth and it would actually
[2:30:18] become his Eden are we here I'm going
[2:30:21] tell you something friends that's that's
[2:30:22] one of the last things to see the whole
[2:30:24] world brother Brown said go on in saying
[2:30:26] Satan worship and that's when the Lord
[2:30:28] perfects his bride I love the power of
[2:30:31] God I think about someday brother Tim on
[2:30:34] that on that great day when when we're
[2:30:37] seated there with Christ on the throne
[2:30:39] and Satan is brought forward for his
[2:30:42] judgment and the Bible says they shall
[2:30:44] narrowly look upon him say is this the
[2:30:47] man that's right that made Nations
[2:30:50] tremble you got to be kidding we fell
[2:30:52] for this and you know I just imagine I
[2:30:55] mean you you can take it or leave it I
[2:30:57] just for me in my mind's eye I don't
[2:31:00] think the Lord will let him get by so
[2:31:02] easily as to step forward and say
[2:31:05] Satan I gave you
[2:31:08] everything I gave you the churches the
[2:31:12] families the schools I gave you science
[2:31:15] and ucation I gave you technology I gave
[2:31:18] you finances I allowed you to become the
[2:31:21] god of the
[2:31:23] age and when you were at your Zenith I
[2:31:27] perfected this queen that you see with
[2:31:30] me I perfected her right under your
[2:31:34] nose oh what a victory
[2:31:39] friends the Apostle Paul warned that one
[2:31:42] of the things that would be very
[2:31:44] prominent is that people people would be
[2:31:47] traitors they would be heady they would
[2:31:50] be highminded and catch it they would be
[2:31:53] lovers of pleasure more than lovers of
[2:31:57] God I said to myself I heard I don't
[2:32:00] remember who now was one of our
[2:32:01] preaching me Ministry team members who
[2:32:04] was ministering might have been brother
[2:32:05] Matt recently and he's quoting that
[2:32:08] scripture and I said Lord don't ever let
[2:32:11] me be guilty of loving me more than I
[2:32:14] love you don't ever let me satisfy this
[2:32:17] rotten old flesh when the enemy comes in
[2:32:21] to Temp me say I am not going to love me
[2:32:23] more than I love him oh that's what the
[2:32:26] world does they're going to love
[2:32:28] theirselves they would be the Bible says
[2:32:29] they would be lovers of
[2:32:32] theirselves truce Breakers false
[2:32:35] accusers say Lord don't ever let me be a
[2:32:38] lover of me more than a lover of you how
[2:32:42] many say Lord I wanted this flesh so
[2:32:45] crucified why you know why don't you
