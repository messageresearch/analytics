I spoke of your honor. I have no defense. Oh, but that's when mercy walked in. Oh, mercy walked in and pleaded my case, called to the stand. It was God's saving grace. The blood was presented and it covered my sin. I was forgiven when mercy walked in. Oh, I stood there and wondered just how could this be that someone so guilty had just been set free. My chains were all broken. And I felt born again that moment when mercy walked in. [Music] Oh, mercy walked in and he pleaded my gaze. fall to the stand. It was God's saving grace.

[Applause] [Music] This one's brand new, so I'll just do this with a guitar. [Music] Oh, what a wind and how the breakers roll. [Music] I tried my best, but Lord, I lost control. I followed selfish will into a storm [Music] where broken mast and tattered sails are born. Now the storm has passed, but I can't see the shore. This vessel won't take water anymore. [Music] I've drifted the wrong way and way too far. &gt;&gt; Lord, how can I get back &gt;&gt; to where you are? Oh Lord, how can I get back to where you are? &gt;&gt; It's been one night without you, Lord. But it seems it's been forever. &gt;&gt; Can't live my life without you, Lord. That's clear now more than ever. I've drifted the wrong way and way too far. &gt;&gt; Oh, how can I get back &gt;&gt; to where you are, &gt;&gt; Lord? How can I get back to where you are? [Music] Jonah found himself in the same place, in the belly of a fish for several days. &gt;&gt; He found your mercy when he turned his face. &gt;&gt; Lord, I'm sorry. I'll turn from my foolish ways. [Music] &gt;&gt; A broken will and shards of shattered pride. [Music] &gt;&gt; We're swallowed down into the angry time. Never more drift drift from you Lord so far. &gt;&gt; If you would take me back &gt;&gt; to where you are. [Music] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'll never more drift from you, Lord, so far. If you would take me back to where you are. &gt;&gt; Oh, please Lord, take me back to where you are. [Music] Praise the Lord. Amen. How many's grateful for all the gifts we have in this church? Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Let's all stand. We're going to turn the order of the service over. Let's just sing this song and invite the the Lord to meet each one of us in in that chamber room. Amen.

Oh h Imanuel, King of Kings, Lord of Lords, bright morning star and throughout eternity. I'm going to praise him and forever more. Oh yes, Lord. Sing it again now as the minister comes. Oh, hail King Jesus. All hail Emmanuel. He's the King of Kings, the Lord of Lords, bright morning star. And throughout eternity I'm going to praise him [Music] and forever more I will reign with him. Let's sing it again now. Oh hell king Jesus. All hell I manuel. [Music] He's the king of kings, the Lord of lords, the bright morning star. And throughout eternity [Music] I'm going to praise him and forever more I will reign with him. Now &gt;&gt; he's looking forward to that day &gt;&gt; where forever we'll reign with him. &gt;&gt; Sorry you got me tonight. &gt;&gt; Brother Mack text me last night. I thought he was joking so I had to call him. He told me he called me first and I missed the call and he says you done missed the will missed the will of the Lord. So I had to move on. It's like, well, hallelujah. But it was meant to be. I I've had a feeling for a couple days I'd be here tonight. So, here I am. Some of you all that was in Sunday school, it's probably been December last year. I spoke on already judged or free from judgment. I had something different on my heart last night, but you know how it goes. You wake up this morning and this sermon pops back out of my notes to me on my heart wise up praying and it's going to be a little different. It won't be exact the same, but some of the stuff will be the same. But I've I've actually changed it to a sermon. I preached a couple times already. But this is going to be my wife says, "Can't you preach something new?" I said, "Well, I was trying She gets tired of hearing the same stuff everywhere we go, but that's what we do. &gt;&gt; So, Romans chapter 8, let's read verses one down through verses 14. I'll read it fast. Romans 8:1. There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the spirit. For the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death. For what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemns sin in the flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the spirit. For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh, but they that are after the flesh the things of the spirit. For to be carnally minded is death, but to be spiritually minded is life and peace, because the carnal mind is enmity against God, for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be. &gt;&gt; Amen. So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God, but ye are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if so be that the spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the spirit of Christ, he is none of his. &gt;&gt; And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin, but the spirit is life because of righteousness. But if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you. For if you live after the flesh, ye shall die. But if you through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live. For as many are led by the spirit of God, they are the sons of God. May God add a blessing to the reading. Have your seats. I changed the title. It's going to be subjection before a quiddle. Bringing your body under subjection. You know, bringing your body under subjection is not just a suggestion in our Christian walk. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a command. So, let's be honest. It's one of the hardest things that you can do is bring your body under subjection. &gt;&gt; The body just wants comfort. It craves pleasure. It resist discipline. We sure do, don't we? The flesh doesn't want to pray. It don't want to read your Bible. It don't want to get up and go to church &gt;&gt; or submit to the spirit of God. It wants its own way and it wants it now. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Every temptation, every compromise, every moment of weakness begins when the body is allowed to lead instead of the spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's why this battle is so fierce. Because a body doesn't want to be ruled. It wants to reign. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Forgot to do something. Forgot to start that timer. I'm not like brother Matt. I won't preach 20 minutes and said it for an hour. He's the only one that can get by with that. But here's the truth. You will either master your body or your body is going to master you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You'll either crucify the flesh or the flesh will crucify you. Even Jesus in the flesh, when Jesus was in the flesh, showed us what it meant to deny the flesh. You know what happened when he went to the wilderness to be tempted after he was baptized? Went into devil comes to you're hungry. Go ahead and make these stones bread. Jesus was tempted to do so. But Jesus had to overcome the hunger in his flesh. He had to overcome the fleshes. No, man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God. So the devil even in Gethsemane Jesus' own words were say the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak. I mean he even said if it be your will let this cup pass from me but nevertheless not my my will but thine be done. He surrendered to the father's will even if it meant agony. So we're living in a time where the flesh is exalted and the spirit is neglected. &gt;&gt; Whoa. People are ruled by their emotions, their appetites, their desires, even their phones. &gt;&gt; Because the truth is, you can't live a victorious life if your body is out of control. If your eyes, your hands, your mouth, feet, appetites are running wild, you your body's not under subjection. One of I said it again, one of the hardest things we'll ever do is bring this body under subjection. &gt;&gt; But I believe I'm looking at some people this evening that has. If you haven't, you're going to. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about a perfection cuz we're never going to perfect this thing right here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We'll never perfect this flesh. So, quit trying. I've tried for years to perfect Brad Yachts. It ain't going to work. &gt;&gt; Give up. Give up. That's what we need to do. Give up bringing this body under subjection that sin will no more reign in your mortal body. It didn't say sin wouldn't be there. &gt;&gt; Sin wouldn't reign. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sin's not going to be my God. Subjection is not your body controlling you. It's you controlling your body. If Paul had to fight this flesh daily, so do we. This is not a one-time victory. It's a daily war. &gt;&gt; Paul was a man filled with the Holy Ghost. He said, "I keep under my body." This means that he brought his body into subjection, &gt;&gt; into discipline, into obedience, &gt;&gt; not just his spirit or his mind, but his physical body. It's a daily dying. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I die daily. &gt;&gt; We need to crucify oursel every day. &gt;&gt; You get up in the morning, go ahead and nail yourself to the cross. &gt;&gt; You're going to die today, flesh. Because 1 Corinthians 9:27 says, "But I keep under my body." I like this word keep under. It means to beat black and blue. &gt;&gt; What? So Paul has said, "I'm beating my body black and blue." He's looking at a boxer because if you read a couple of scriptures before, he's talking about I'm going to run. He's talking about boxing. I'm not going fight into the air. A boxer, they like to hit you right here under your eyes. That's where you get black and blue easy. Sway you up and you can't see him nowhere. You're sitting here boxing like this. You see, you you watched a a big fight where they're like this constantly. You have to get beat in the eyes. They can't hardly see. That's what the devil wants to do to us tonight. But that's what we need to do to our own body. We need to beat our body black and blue and bring it under subjection, which is to treat it as a slave, to discipline it. What does a slave do? You're going to do what I want you to do. &gt;&gt; You're going to go where I say you're going to go. &gt;&gt; You're going to bring this body under subjection and shall not come into condemnation. I done skipped where I'm going. That's my next verse. John 5:24 says, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into judgment, &gt;&gt; condemnation, but is passed from death unto life." &gt;&gt; You don't even have to go to trial. There's no judgment against you, brother JD. &gt;&gt; It says, "You shall not come into condemnation. You shall not come into judgment. Hallelujah. There's no sentence of condemnation, no punishment. We're free from it tonight. You're free. You're free from a judgment. If you've passed from death to life, we do not have to stand in judgment. &gt;&gt; We will not have to stand there. If you're justified, sanctified, filled with the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; church, we're free from it tonight. &gt;&gt; You're free from the judgment. We are chosen of God made in his image. Not talking about the flesh man Jesus. &gt;&gt; They none of us right now looks like the Hoffman head of Christ. &gt;&gt; I wish we did, &gt;&gt; but we don't. He's not talking about that flesh man, Jesus. We're made in the image of almighty God. We're not not some man, but God himself, the image of Christ. So if you have the Holy Ghost today, say it again, you're free from judgment. &gt;&gt; Amen. Go ahead and tell the devil tonight, you're free from judgment. &gt;&gt; Don't matter what he throws at you, you're free tonight. &gt;&gt; You can say when the judgment takes place, you're not even going to be there. &gt;&gt; In the front, &gt;&gt; you're going to be right behind him being judges. &gt;&gt; We will be around the throne as judges. So there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; How many's in Christ Jesus tonight? &gt;&gt; If you're not, don't leave this building until you are. &gt;&gt; You know, when we Paul, he he struggled with himself. &gt;&gt; He battled that old nature. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He has a new one inside of him, but he battled that old nature. We're going to read in in Romans 7:14. We're going to read these verses. When I read these verses, you got to remember Paul is converted. This is not a unsaved Paul. He is letting us know what this flesh we have to deal with while we're living in this thing. So, here's a disclaimer for you tonight. These scriptures will not give you a license to sin. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going to read the King James version of these scriptures. You know how it is with Romans 7:14 on down through there. If you read too fast, you'll get tongue tied. I do anyway. Just a hillbilling, Tennessee. But I'm going to read the King James and they're going to put up a version of the NLT. I know it's not the King James version, but you'll understand it. I like all the Bible. &gt;&gt; Every version of the Bible is not correct. &gt;&gt; I thought I throw that in. It was free. 7:14. For we know that the law is spiritual, but I'm carnal, sold under sin. So the trouble is not the law. For it is spiritual and good. The trouble is just with me. For I am all too human, a slave to sin. Do you feel that way tonight? &gt;&gt; How many humans do we have in a building? &gt;&gt; Well, the rest of you are angels. Well, we can stand up and see, take the name of Jesus with you. We don't need this tonight. &gt;&gt; How many humans do we have in a building tonight? &gt;&gt; I'm human. Yeah, &gt;&gt; sometimes you know I feel like I can't how can I even be saved being carnal that I am. &gt;&gt; How many how many feels that way sometimes? Brother says in this Jesus made a statement a promise. The inside man says that's true. &gt;&gt; The outside man reasons that it cannot be true. &gt;&gt; And then you ignore the outside man and accept this inside man. That's the same thing that Paul is speaking of. He was sold under the law to carnal sin. Every one of us is the same. &gt;&gt; That's the reason we are have the troubles we do. &gt;&gt; Married four or five times and this and that and all kinds of sin and adulteries and everything else along in our lives is because of these things we are carnal. and that part must perish. But then inside, we're a spirit man, soul inside. That's faith in God's word. We are bringing our outside body under subjection to the word by accepting what God has said. &gt;&gt; Verse 15, for that which I do, I allow not. For what I would, that do I not, but what I hate that do I. In other words, I don't really understand myself &gt;&gt; for I want to do what is right. &gt;&gt; So if you're in sin, you don't want to do what's right. &gt;&gt; He says, "For I want to do what is right, but I don't do it." &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Instead, I do what I hate. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many's there tonight? How many does what you hate? Even today, you've done what you hate. You have Why do we have to repent every day? &gt;&gt; One of the last things you do when you lay bed in the bed at night. God, forgive me what I've done today. &gt;&gt; Again, this is the uncon this is this isn't an unconverted Paul &gt;&gt; when before he didn't care. &gt;&gt; Say what? &gt;&gt; He was a big law man. &gt;&gt; Amen. He had Christians killed. He had them stoned. He had them put in prison. &gt;&gt; So, this can't be the same Paul that was back then. &gt;&gt; He's not out running around drinking and smoking and running around with women or or men women. &gt;&gt; That's not what Paul's talking about. &gt;&gt; Again, I want to say this. This does not give us a free pass to sin. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you're a sinner, you don't have these struggles. &gt;&gt; You don't care nothing about it. &gt;&gt; You would do all kinds of things. You just don't care. It don't matter to you. You start drinking, smoking, cussing, running around, listening all kinds of music, and you didn't care. &gt;&gt; You didn't care a bit. &gt;&gt; Verse 17. Now then, it is no more I that do it, but sin that Don't get ahead of me. Thank you. Now that is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me. So dwelleth. I seen this just a couple days ago. I thought I what dwells really means. It means cohabitation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To live together. So when a man and a woman not married, they live together, they're just cohabited. &gt;&gt; They're not married. So it's the way you are. Sin and you live together. You're not married. &gt;&gt; Thank God. We're married to God, ain't we? &gt;&gt; Now you can go. So I am not the one doing it, doing wrong. It is sin living in me that does it. For I know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You keep getting ahead of me. I know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing. For to will is present with me. And how to perform that which is good I find not. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I know that nothing good lives in me. &gt;&gt; Nothing good. That's why Jesus says, "Call no man good." There's nothing good in us. We always hear that. Oh, he's a good man. We should say that. They are good. There's some good people, but not the good he was talking about. Where am I at? There's nothing good that lives in me that is in my sinful nature. &gt;&gt; I want to do what is right, but I can't. &gt;&gt; He's not talking about his soul. &gt;&gt; He's talking about this sticky nature &gt;&gt; that we live in. &gt;&gt; He's talking about this flesh. You can't trust it. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you say, "I trust my flesh." Tonight, I want you to come up here. I'm going lay hands on you and cast a lying spirit off of you. &gt;&gt; Cuz we can't trust his flesh. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Why would Why would brother Ram say his greatest enemy was himself? &gt;&gt; He didn't say, "My greatest enemy is my wife &gt;&gt; or my husband or the church or the pastor." &gt;&gt; Amen. The greatest was himself because in perfect strength by perfect weakness. Love this message. He says we smother him out. We drive him away. We keep God out of our lives because of our own selves. &gt;&gt; I often said the greatest enemy I got is William Brham. He's the one that gets in God's way. He's the one that gets lazy. He's the one that gets to a place sometimes where he thinks he can do it &gt;&gt; something about it. And when he does, that just shoves God right out of the picture. Amen. &gt;&gt; But when I can get rid of that guy, &gt;&gt; if we can get rid of this guy, &gt;&gt; when I can get to a place that he is that he is out of the way, then God can come over and do things that William Brandham knows nothing about. &gt;&gt; That's when God can use you. That's when he can use any of you. He can use anybody when we can get out of the way. &gt;&gt; But as long as we get ourselves in the way, he can't. Verse 19 says, "For the good that I would, I do not, but the evil which I would not that I do." He said, "I want to do what is good, but I don't. I don't want to do what is wrong, but I do it anyway. &gt;&gt; He's like, "What are you even talking about?" I don't do nothing wrong. Glory to God. Did you see that brother at church? His hair was sticking up in the back. You did nothing wrong, huh? Wow. We're in a battle. Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; We're in a battle. &gt;&gt; We're not battling against our wives and husbands. &gt;&gt; We're battling against this thing right here. &gt;&gt; Constantly, day in day out, battle this thing right here. &gt;&gt; Now, if I do that, I would not. It is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me. But if I do what I don't want to do, I'm not really the one doing it. I'm not the one doing wrong. It is a sin living in me &gt;&gt; that does it. So then if I find then a law that when I would do good, evil is present. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, I have discovered this principle of life that when I want to do what is right, I'll always do what is wrong. Goodness. As long as we're in this body, we have sin. &gt;&gt; But says in believing God, this outside is sin. Do you know your body's sin? That's the reason you don't try to perfect that body. It's sin. Did you know that? &gt;&gt; He asked a question, not me. It was born in sin, shaped into iniquity, come into the world speaking lies. And that soul is the same way Your soul was the same way your flesh was one day. It was dark with sin. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But when that soul is born again of God, then that soul can't die. &gt;&gt; The soul that sins sinnth shall die. &gt;&gt; But he that believeth on me has everlasting life. Amen. &gt;&gt; Then that then there is an immortal life living in that body. &gt;&gt; That's like a stream coming from heaven like a core inside of a man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the part that's godly. &gt;&gt; It operates this body. &gt;&gt; But before this body can ever become perfected, the spirit will bring it into subjection. Amen. &gt;&gt; To God to make you in a war all the time a constant. Paul says we will never get more than he when I would do good that evil is near me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So there's a constant war the flesh against the spirit. Verse 23. But I see another law in my members war against the law of my mind bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members. But there is another power within me that is at war with my mind. This power makes me a slave to sin that is still within me. &gt;&gt; He's talking about the battle &gt;&gt; between the flesh and the spirit. You remember the story of the old Indian chief? &gt;&gt; How you doing, chief? Pretty good. Pretty bad. I don't make a good Indian, so I ain't going to try. He said, 'Well, how do you mean pretty bad, pretty good? He says, 'Well, since me received the Holy Ghost, there's been two dogs in me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I know some preachers preach there's no two dogs. Shame on them. Well, since me received the Holy Ghost, there's been two dogs in me. One of them a black dog, one of them a white dog. And they argue all the time. &gt;&gt; You're going to get up. You're going to go to church. No, I ain't. I'm too tired. &gt;&gt; They'll just growl at one another. The white dog wants me to do good. The black dog wants me to do bad. Well, chief, which one of them wins? &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; It depends on who chief feeds the most. &gt;&gt; You go around say, "I can't seem to bring my body under subjection." &gt;&gt; Who you feeding? &gt;&gt; Who you feeding the most? &gt;&gt; I think Brother Jayce will be back on Sundays. Don't worry. I try to control my tongue. I try to control my temper, but I can't. Who you feeding? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Oh, if we're not praying and reading the Bible like we should, our flesh controls us. Oh, but we'll get up first thing in the morning. I posted a picture last night. three likes, we'll move along. &gt;&gt; But if we feed that spiritual man a daily diet of the word, &gt;&gt; this body will do what I tell it to. &gt;&gt; You're going to get up. I don't care if it is 5:00 in the morning. You're going to get up, get you a cup of coffee. You're going to go over in your chair. I'm sure brother Jason tells his body this every morning. You're going to get up and go to that chair. You're going to sit in it and you're going to talk to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then you're going to read your Bible. And then if you got time before you go to work, then pick this up. Don't worry. I got 21 minutes and 46 seconds. Glory. I hope it's all right. &gt;&gt; You'll say, "But I'm tired. I've worked all day. I started work at 8:00 and I started sweating and I didn't sweat till I got off work. I'm tired." Water hooks preaching tonight. If it's Brad Ys, I'm not going. I'm just gonna stay home and stream. I wonder who's preached at brother Donny's. Who you feeding? It don't matter who's up here. &gt;&gt; I'd rather be sitting right there with my wife listening to brother Caleb or brother JD standing right here. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. Or brother Matthew, you're here. &gt;&gt; Who you feeding? &gt;&gt; Who you feeding? You'll say, "No, you're going to get up off that recliner. You're going to go in the bathroom and take a shower. You're going to get dressed. You're going to church. &gt;&gt; You're going to do what I tell you you're going to do." &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I might do that, but I'm gonna go to church. I'm gonna sit my arms folded &gt;&gt; cuz I don't like him. &gt;&gt; It's hot in here. Well, brother Tony ain't leading the singing tonight. It's brother Ken. &gt;&gt; Who you feeding? &gt;&gt; It don't matter who's leading the singing. &gt;&gt; You come to worship God. &gt;&gt; I worship him in spirit and truth. &gt;&gt; That was free, too. You're going to sing. You're going to clap your hands. You're going to worship God. And when the preacher gets up there and start preaching, you're going to amen. &gt;&gt; That's better. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; You're going to say hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If something hits you again, say, "Glory to God." &gt;&gt; Say it again, preacher. You're going to bring your body under subjection. &gt;&gt; I'm never going to get out of Romans 7. You're going to bring your body under subjection. Do you see where Paul comes? This next verse. Oh wretched man that I am. &gt;&gt; That's right. Who shall deliver me from this body of death? Oh, what a miserable person I am. How many feels that way sometimes. &gt;&gt; Who will free me from this life &gt;&gt; that is so dominated by sin &gt;&gt; and death? Who will deliver me from this flesh body that we live in? &gt;&gt; Amen. Paul is saying, "We're held captive by this flesh." You know, when Paul was in prison, he was chained to a soldier. &gt;&gt; So, wherever Paul went, that soldier went. So, Paul had to go to the bathroom, there went the soldier. &gt;&gt; Paul sit down to eat, there went the soldier. Paul went to pray, there was a soldier right beside him. Man, poor guy. I had to listen to Paul's prayer. Paul was writing out the the books. The soldier was watching what he was writing. He was dragging him around. He liken It's likened that to we're chained to a dead man. &gt;&gt; That's what we are. We're a bunch of dead people. &gt;&gt; We're dragging these old bodies around. We'll drag these old things to work. We'll drag these things to Walmart. We'll drag these things into church. Sit down right there and don't move. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, wretched man that I am. Who is going to save me? I thank God. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; Through Jesus Christ our Lord. &gt;&gt; So then with the mind, he ain't talking about this right here. Well, he's talking about the mind is the soul. &gt;&gt; So then with this mind, I myself will serve the law of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But with this flesh, the law of sin, &gt;&gt; sin is to miss the mark. &gt;&gt; Fall short, make a mistake. We all know that. So, but a man that is born of God, what a paradox. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; Cannot commit sin. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are going to bring this body under subjection. Brother says, do you know your body is sin? That's the reason you don't try to perfect that body. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's sin. &gt;&gt; Did you know that? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You know, Paul no doubt wondered, "How can I even be saved &gt;&gt; with this sin body I'm living in? Why is this body always causing me problems?" &gt;&gt; We think the same way. Why is this thing always causing me issues? Amen. &gt;&gt; Wherever I go, I got problems. &gt;&gt; This thing is causing me problems. &gt;&gt; Is there anybody who can deliver me? You know, sometimes I don't even feel like a Christian. &gt;&gt; Well, two of you don't. &gt;&gt; How can I be a Christian with that thought went through my head? &gt;&gt; How can I be a Christian when I said something I shouldn't have? Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going get a little honest with you. I think I did this during Sunday school, but you know, when you go into a store, we'll use Walmart. It's a bad place, but we all used to listen to stuff we shouldn't have listened to, right? Some of some of you still do, &gt;&gt; but anyway, but you're going to Walmart and you hear a song you heard years ago. &gt;&gt; For me, when I say years ago, 80s &gt;&gt; and what's bad, I'll walk through Walmart and I'll be singing it before I know what I was even doing. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot. I was among angels tonight. &gt;&gt; You know, you'll sit at a restaurant, you'll hear the music, you'll just tap your fingers a little bit. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; Then you're like, "What in the world?" Anybody here from church? Oh wretched man that I am, who will deliver me? &gt;&gt; No wonder when Paul comes to 81, we finally made it back. Therefore, there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No judgment. That's right. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. If you're in Christ, you're not judged. You're not guilty. &gt;&gt; You are free from condemnation. You're being declared innocent by Christ. And the only way we can be free is that you are in Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not some man. &gt;&gt; Amen. But Christ, &gt;&gt; the final verdict not guilty. &gt;&gt; No punishment. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So there is therefore now no punishment to you that are in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; There's no evidence against you. &gt;&gt; So you can go say, "What sin? &gt;&gt; What sin?" &gt;&gt; That's right. Cuz when you ask for forgiveness, you say, "How quick does my sins are forgiven?" How quick can you say, "God, forgive me?" &gt;&gt; Just like that, your sins are in the sea of God's forgetfulness. We need to quit asking God to forgive us of our sins. We'll ask God every day. &gt;&gt; Lord, I did this thing 15 years ago. God, please forgive me. &gt;&gt; Come on. I did that one time. I kept praying for something I'd done years ago. I guess God finally got tired of it. It's like he spoke to your heart. You know how it is. It's still small voice. &gt;&gt; What are you talking about? All I hear is what's coming out of your mouth. You're confessing something you did years ago. I don't even remember it. It's under the blood. You say, "But you don't know what I've been through." &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; No, I may not. It don't matter. It don't matter what you done. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The blood of Jesus is here to free us tonight. &gt;&gt; Romans 4:25 said, "Who was delivered for our offenses." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; "And was raised again for our justification." Amen. &gt;&gt; This word right here used in justification only used two times in the Bible. The other one is Romans 5:18. Therefore, as by the offense of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation. Now, he's talking about Adam. &gt;&gt; What happened to Adam and Eve caused sin and death in the world. That one judgment brought sin and death to the world. But &gt;&gt; I had to put that in there. That's fun. Even so, by the righteousness of one &gt;&gt; free gift. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many like gifts? &gt;&gt; We got one tonight. And it's free. &gt;&gt; You don't have to pay for this one. &gt;&gt; You shouldn't have to pay for a gift anyway, should you? &gt;&gt; Brother Chris, you brought me a gift. You say, "Here, you'll be $20. You keep it." No mercy. Even so, by the righteousness of one free gift, that's God came down, become a man, died for you. &gt;&gt; The righteousness of that one free gift came upon all men unto the justification of life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And justification here means just one little word, a quiddle. &gt;&gt; Amen. a judgment that a person is not guilty of the crime in which that person has been charged. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; 10 minutes. I was in a courtroom one day. The prosecutor had all these charges against me. He was looking for the death penalty. If you couldn't get the death penalty, he wanted a life without parole. &gt;&gt; He wanted me. He wanted to destroy me. He wanted me for himself. He wanted me to be con convicted. You know when you get in a court, you hear all rise. Everybody stands up. I stood up and looked and out come the judge. And it was God himself. I said, "This is going to be a fast trial. I'm dead. &gt;&gt; All right, prosecutor. What you got for me? You know how the them lawyers do? They'll walk back and forth. They'll go to jury and try to stir them in the face and try to convince them what you've done is wrong. I bring charges against Brad J. He has failed time and time again. He's lied. He's thought evil. He's He's gotten angry. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; He's lost his temper. &gt;&gt; Had impure thoughts. He's rebellious. I've got that on record. &gt;&gt; Every thought, every word, every action has been recorded. And even today, we're getting more evidence on him. &gt;&gt; Satan starts sneering at the judge. &gt;&gt; He know he was God. He says, "Now don't tell me you don't see it, God. &gt;&gt; You are just, aren't you? You must condemn the guilty." Cuz your own word says, "The soul that sinnth shall die." &gt;&gt; But what he didn't realize, he didn't catch the revelation. &gt;&gt; He said, "The soul that sinnth." Just hold that thought. The prosecutor didn't really catch the revelation. He didn't know that from my soul I have passed from death to life. &gt;&gt; All he sees is what I've done right here. &gt;&gt; He does all of this. He says Brad Johnson done all he's been an evil person. He's the prosecution rests. &gt;&gt; He thought he had it won &gt;&gt; cuz he looks over in my chair. He's by himself. No lawyer take his case. The judge just looks at me from the evidence that's been presented today. It looks like you're guilty. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; The evidence is stacked up against you. Your accuser has said you have done this and you have done that. Where's your lawyer? &gt;&gt; Come on, &gt;&gt; your honor. I have no defense. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; No lawyer will take my case. They know I've done wrong. &gt;&gt; There's no way I could win this. I can't even get a fair trial. &gt;&gt; How do you plead then? I was fixing to say guilty. &gt;&gt; But before I went, that door slams open and it storms somebody. I'll take his case. &gt;&gt; Prosecutor turns and looks and sees Jesus walking down the aisle. Amen. &gt;&gt; Still has blood on him. &gt;&gt; He says, "I'll be his lawyer. &gt;&gt; I'll take his case." Aren't you glad tonight we've got somebody that'll take your case. &gt;&gt; Devil turns and looks at Jesus. Are you crazy? Didn't you hear all the evidence? You even know he's done these things? Yeah. You won't hear your defense lawyer saying, "Yeah, I know he did these things." &gt;&gt; But what you don't know, devil, that I've placed something down on the inside of him before the foundation of the world. He can't be lost. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Christ comes in says, "We got new evidence though, your honor. We got new evidence to prove that he didn't do it. He is falsely accused and I can prove it." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We have new blood evidence that will prove his innocence. Amen. &gt;&gt; In court, blood evidence can convict or acquit, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Depending on whose blood it is. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The blood speaks. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad the blood speaks for you tonight? It's like when Adam when a Abel was bringing that lamb to sacrifice &gt;&gt; and he picks that lamb up and throws it on the altar, grabs a rock and starts cutting his throat. That blood spurting out. That blood was speaking for Abel. &gt;&gt; When Jesus went to Calvary, [Applause] &gt;&gt; that spirit pierced his side. Blood dropped down. The blood spoke for you, Chris. &gt;&gt; The blood spoke for you, Brother Steve. &gt;&gt; The blood speaks. &gt;&gt; I stowed this from brother David Siler. It was so good. Not all of it, but some of it's good. &gt;&gt; DNA. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; We know what DNA does today. People's been in prison for years and years over a crime. &gt;&gt; But they have DNA comes out and these people are set free. &gt;&gt; It's all about the blood. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Look at me. It's all about this blood. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I paid the price for you. &gt;&gt; Your honor, though he never done it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, what a defense I had. What a lawyer. He had a 100% acquitt rate. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, some lawyers, they want to try to settle out of court. &gt;&gt; Oh, we we'll sell this thing out of court. You go ahead and pay us so much money and we'll we won't go to court. We'll drop it. That proves you're guilty. &gt;&gt; Anybody settles out of court, you're guilty. &gt;&gt; Jesus says, "I'm not settling this thing out of court. We're going to trial." &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm glad he did. &gt;&gt; If you got mercy on your as your lawyer, you can't lose. &gt;&gt; By the time our lawyer was finished, there was nothing the prosecutor could say. Amen. &gt;&gt; When my lawyer finished, he says the defense rests. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, you know what happens after that? The case is sent to the jury. The judge says, "Jury, you go back there into the back room there. Y'all talk it among yourselves and come back with a verdict." The devil didn't pay much attention that we was in a stacked court. That God was the judge, God was the jury, and God was my lawyer. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He says, "We need we don't need to go in a back room to deliberate. We've got our verdict right now. Not guilty." &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; Did you see what he just did today? not guilty. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The judge just looks at me and says, "You're not guilty. You're free to go." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All the charges have been dropped. So therefore, there is now no condemnation to them who are in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Thank God. &gt;&gt; Thank God. The judge himself became our attorney. God became man. There was no attorney that could do it. We couldn't find one. Moses and the law, the prophets, they couldn't do it. So, the judge became jury, attorney, and judge. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Stacked court. Like I said, &gt;&gt; it's like Donald Trump. He's got a stack court. He's got a stack Congress. So, anything he says he wants to pass law, he can do it. When God says you're not guilty, nobody can stand in front of him and says, "But you're wrong, God." You know in a in port of law 19 seconds over. &gt;&gt; What's brother Matt say? Overtime. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I'm about finished though. There's a law. If you've been tried and found not guilty, you can't be tried of that again. [Applause] So when the devil tries to bring you back up to court, &gt;&gt; comes back up front of God, &gt;&gt; what are you doing, devil? He says that Brad Campbell, do you know what he done today? I said he's not guilty, devil. They throw him out. &gt;&gt; You're in contempt of court. That's 30 days in jail. You don't even have a case. &gt;&gt; Glory. Says when he becomes both judge and jury and attorney, he pleaded our case. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We found guilty by his own law. He come and took the guilty person's place that was in the sanctuary. He took your sin and took it upon himself and died and paid the price and shed his blood and gave back his own token, his own blood, his own life. Why? We are perfect. Goodness, the case is dismissed. There is no more sin to the believer. Oh God have mercy. If the people can't see that that there is no more case cuz he that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me has eternal life &gt;&gt; and shall not come to judgment but has passed from death unto life. There is the case &gt;&gt; case dismissed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Let's all stand. case dismissed. No more case to it. He says, "And how that we are perfected, perfected, absolutely spotless and blameless. Not one sin on us." He says, "Are you above temptation?" Never. Do you sin every day? Yes, sir. But we are perfected because we are in him. And God could no more judge us than nothing. Cuz when he judged Christ, he judged me. He judged you. And he can't judge me again because he took my judgment. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So today we are free. &gt;&gt; Free from condemnation. Hallelujah. Y'all sing something. I'll keep preaching. From subjection to the acquitt. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm so thankful when they ran that blood back. That blood spoke for me and it was the sinless blood. I stood in the courtroom. The judge turned my way. Well, it looks like you're guilty now. What do you say? [Music] I spoke of your honor. I have no defense. But that's when mercy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, mercy walked in and he pleaded my case. Called to the stand. It was God's saving grace. The blood was presented and it was Jesus blood covered my sins. Oh, I was forgiven when mercy walked in. Oh, I stood there and I wondered how could this be that someone so guilty had just been set free. My chains were all broken and I felt born again that moment when mercy walked in. Oh mercy walked in and he pleaded my case called stand. [Music] The blood was presented and it covered my sin. I was forgiven when mercy walking. One more time. &gt;&gt; Oh mercy walked in. and he pleaded my case. He called to the stand. It was God's saving grace. The blood was presented and it covered my sin. [Music] I was forgiven when mercy walked in. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad? Aren't you glad? Looks like I have one prayer request. I believe this from brother Jason. I put these things on. I can't. It's very lengthy, but I'll read it all. He says, "Please have prayer for a woman that Sister Debbie and I met in a while out of town yesterday who has stage four lung cancer that has already spread to other places in her body and has a short time to live unless the Lord has mercy on her. She is a part of a non-denominational church and is looking for the Lord for healing." I was able to instruct her more perfectly in how to accept all that Christ has already done for her at Calvary. I sent her the books, Do You Fear Cancer? From Brother Brandham and Christ the Healer by FF Bosworth. After testifying to her about the supernatural we've seen and instruct her in the scripture, Sister Debbie and I laid hands on her in prayer right in the furniture store showroom. Please agree with us for the Lord to spare her life as he reveals his word to her. She has already asked for our service link and has received a service from last Sunday. She's middle-aged and wants to live for her children and grandchildren. I believe that's all all we have. Who has a need here? I'm needy. Y'all lay hands on each other. Let's pray. Don't let me do the prayer and you all pray as well. Heavenly Father, Lord, we're glad that we have an attorney that stood for us that day. Lord, Lord, mercy walked in in our lives one day. Lord, when we were out in sin, you came through the door. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Father, your blood set us free, Father. Lord, how thankful we are for that, Lord. Lord, I I pray, Father, that you just help us, Lord, that we have to bring these bodies under subjection to the Holy Spirit. Father, we need to control our very being, Lord. That we control our tongue, our what we say and what we hear, what we listen to, and Lord, what we look at, Father, how we act, Father. Lord, we'll place our body in into your hands for that subjection, Lord. Father, you see this request for Brother Jason, Father, this lady dying of cancer, Lord. Lord, if you don't move, she's she'll be gone from us. But Lord, you heard a request. She wants to live for her children and grandchildren. Father, that's a good desire, Lord. Father, she's heard the heard the witness from her pastor. Father, Lord, if there's a seed of life down inside that soul, Lord, may that light strike that seed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Father, if it be your will, Lord, may the healing touch of Jehovah just go to this sister. Father, Lord, may there be a complete deliverance. May we even hear a testimony, Father, how that she is cancer free. Lord, every person here in this building that had their hands raised, Lord, you know their need behind their hand, Father. It don't matter what it is. No need is too great for you. You can move for it, Father. I pray, God, may you move it, Lord. Lord, be be with this service, Father. Lord, it's over. Father, I hope something was said that had been a blessing. Lord, &gt;&gt; hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Father, I pray Lord you be with our pastor. Lord, I pray for brother Matt. Lord, is believe he's home sick this evening. Father, may you heal him, Father. &gt;&gt; May the heal and touch Jehovah, just go to him, Lord. I pray those that's on the internet, Father, that's sick and need you, Father. I pray for each one of them. You go to them Lord and may they be healed even as the prayer is made for them Lord in Jesus name we pray. Amen. Sing something. Mercy rero my life. God's mercy rerote my life. [Music] I should have fall in my soul cast down but mercy rero my &gt;&gt; I'm sorry I just got three more just come in. Brother Luther he has a request for his shoulders. It's been painful of late. It's from Sister Meredith. Please remember Kevin Renfro in prayer tonight. He's a very close friend of our family. Will be having open heart surgery on Friday. Praying the Lord will be with him and the surgery will exceed even the doctor's expectations. Sister Phyllis said, "I've had two special I have two special unspoken prayer requests and a prayer request for my sister Susie as they have recommended four rounds of chemo as part of her treatment. Her first treatment is to start next week and she's very scared by all of the all it entails. Thank you. Let's pray for these requests. Heavenly Father, Lord, you see Brother Luther's need, Lord. Lord, I can sympathize my brother having shoulder pain for I've had it myself, Father. Lord, it hinders you from being able to do some kind of work, Lord. But I pray, Father, may you heal my brother, Father. Even as we stand right now, may you just heal him, Lord. Father, Sister Meredith, this request for this man named Kevin. Father, open heart surgery. Lord, we serve the great physician. You're the great surgeon, Father. Lord, I just pray, Lord, may you guide the surgeon's hand, Lord. &gt;&gt; Her request was, may it meet the expectations beyond that of the doctors, Lord. Father, we pray for Sister Phyllis, her unspoken request, Lord. You know what they are, Father. May you move there according to your will. Lord, our sister Susie fix to go through chemo. Father's nervous about it, Lord. But I pray, Father, may your spirit just go with her, Father. May you give her the comfort she needs, Lord. Father, I just pray, Father, that you just move for her, Father. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Sing again. Mercy for God. &gt;&gt; All in my soul cast out but mercy [Music] rewrote my life.

[Music] Oh God's mercy [Music] rerote my life. [Music] Oh, I should have fallen my soul cast down, but mercy rro my life. &gt;&gt; Has anybody got a testimony? [Music] So, I drove to Alabama on I don't know, Friday or I don't know, Monday and then um drove back yesterday just to see my sister-in-law and her kids because they were there. So, it was a five-hour drive and I took off in the morning. Um, and got on like the wrong exit with the map somehow and I got stuck in traffic like a wreck. I was on the wrong road at like 30 minute delay and it was really annoying. And then I got to and then I got some texts from her like she didn't feel good or and I was like maybe she didn't really want me to come but that wasn't what anyway I called her. We kind of like figured out what the text was, but then I had like such a weird feeling because I was already like I was only like a little bit out of Pooler and I'm like, should I just go home? I don't know. I I really felt weird about just going and I was delayed already so much, but I couldn't get a hold of Steve. I'm like, I wanted him to say, "Yeah, just come home." And my sister-in-law was like, "No, it's up to you. Like, we want you." Anyway, it was like a lot of back and forth and I can't I could not make a decision. So, I just stopped and prayed and still, you know, I'm like, I don't know if I should go or like turn around and go home. I couldn't get like a clear answer. So, when I stopped praying, I just put the address into where she was and I I took off to her where she was. And I get down the road and the map like probably like 40 minutes and there's like it's raining but the map keeps saying visibility poor visibility. Is it still like like that? And it wasn't. It was nice. And so I just thought that was interesting. I kept probably three times it was saying low visibility. Is it still there? And sure enough, like there was a road, a car like way off in the ditch. And it was there were spots where it was low visibility just like a couple times. And I've never driven in that. That's really scary. You can see nothing. It's like a white out snowstorm. That's the only thing I've ever experienced like that. &gt;&gt; But um I just know God protected me and it was I definitely feel like it was his will for me to go visit with her. It was a productive, you know, visit. But um anyway, I just want to thank God for protecting me and delaying me. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He He watches out for us. Anybody else?
