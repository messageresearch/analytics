brother wave upon wave with the holy spirit just coming and ministering to the lives of young people god loves young people and i wanted to encourage you tonight this is just opening comments these are not momentary blessings weekends like this these are eternal sacred moments sacred sands that god has given to you and i that's going to last forever and the effects of these meetings are not temporary we're not here for a weekend flame did anybody say amen i'm not here for a weekend flame and young people these are some of the greatest times of your life and i would encourage you to just drink it all in when i look back over our short life 49 years and going to youth camps from when i was just a little boy myself and milton west milton ohio and ohio area those are the greatest times of our lives and this weekend the ministers that are minister for you i want to encourage each of you young people to look beyond just for now because when we minister to you we're actually ministering and looking into your positive future god's giving the ministry the faithful ministry an anointing to not speak to you just where you're at now but he's they're actually anointed to look beyond the now and preach you into your future so i encourage you to just lay aside every way we're creating a heavenly atmosphere for one another god's breathing hope into you he's breathing faith into you into your future and that's an expected end god looks down the road and he doesn't see you crashed up or missing the rapture but he sees you with an expected inn full of full of peace and full of strength and i just want to say this right at the beginning everything's going to be okay god's got it all in control god's dwelling in the lives and hearts of now we've gone on many years in the message and i'm looking at many of your faces and i know a lot of your fathers and mothers some of your pastors have allowed you to come whether mike walls is here he drove 17 people here in different vehicles and some of your fathers and mothers are very dear to our hearts and little did we know down the road we'd be speaking to the children's children in the message here in south carolina this weekend is the children of the children it's been raised in the message the youth of yesterday you are their children you are the church of today so throughout this whole weekend we're not going to speak condensating to you i'm sorry that i'm up here like this we're not condensing speaking down but we're here to encourage you we're here to jump into the trenches with you we're here because we love you the lord jesus has been very present and we sense him right now standing very close to us we were just in belgium europe just a few weeks ago and holland in germany and spoke for young people that we had been with 25 years ago 1996 they were just young people and 25 years later they're now the pastor pastor's wife musicians trustees deacons and as we traveled throughout europe it was those young men and those young ladies that were the leaders in the church you are not the church of tomorrow you are the church of today so it's time to rise and just before we turn to the scripture i thought lord what a prayer lord place the desire and the love for you and your word deep down in my heart that's not you trying that's god just doing it for you and the service tonight i want to dedicate to bethel tabernacle to their pastor to the team and to the congregation of bethel tabernacle it's going to be very personal i have a lot of slides to show you that's going to bring right down home but i want to dedicate the service tonight to this church that's invited us all to be together for such a time as this let's stand deuteronomy chapter 6 thank you physicians and this is a lot of the team so if you can find your place i want you to hear tonight really close deuteronomy chapter 6. tonight we're speaking on restoration continues and restoration is continuing right throughout this building tonight i have a quote in front of me brother branham in the last year of his ministry in jeffersonville said somehow i just feel we're going deuteronomy chapter 6. he said there's something laying right ahead for us remember i believe i'm prophesying great joy lays ahead believe it many saddened hearts will be made great mysteries will be made clear and people who are sad will be turned into joy may that be fulfilled even this weekend can the young people say amen now we've all come from hundreds and thousands of miles let's put our all into the service amen deuteronomy chapter 6 we prayed verse 4 hero israel the lord our god is one lord let me believe that tonight and thou shall love the lord thy god with all thine heart and with all thy soul and with all thy might and these words which i command thee this day shall be and i shall be and i so it's not supposed to stay in our minds or our emotions it's to go deeper than that and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children and thou shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house and when thou walk us by the way and when thou liest down and when thou risest up and thou shall bind them for a sign upon my hand and thou shalt they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes and thou shalt write them upon the post of thy house and on thy gates and it shall be when the lord thy god shall have brought thee into the land not maybe not hope so not how you doing but verse 10 says when the lord thy god shall have brought thee into the land which he swear unto thy fathers to abraham to isaac unto jacob to give thee great and goodly cities which thou build us not young people you didn't build them houses full of all good things which thou fill us not and wells did which thou digest not vineyards and olive trees which thou plant us not when thou shalt have eaten and be full god fill our hearts tonight god has given us wonderful things can we all say praise the lord god has given us wonderful things just turn over to deuteronomy 11 verse 18 just a couple more verses as the restoration continues 11 chapter 11 verse 18 of deuteronomy therefore shall you lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul and bind them for a sign upon your hand that's the works of your hands and that they may be as frontlets between your eyes or that's what you see things through is through the word of god verse 19 and you shall be quiet about this to your children don't talk about it just be quiet they'll pick it up somewhere along the road is that what the bible says you shall teach them your children speaking of them when thou sittest in my house and thou walk us by the way and when thou lie us down and when thou risest up and thou shall write them upon the doorpost of thine house and upon thy gates that your days may be multiplied and the days of your children and the land which the lord swear unto your fathers to give them as the days of heaven upon the earth verse 22 and if you shall diligently keep all these commandments which i command you to do them to love the lord your god to walk in all his ways and to cleave unto him verse 20 and thou shall write them upon the doorpost of thine house and upon thy gates lord write them upon our hearts tonight god bless you you can have your seats maybe brothers you can just bring up our our first slide as we just come into this part of the service and brothers are going to be helping us a little bit i wanted you to be able to see this that comes up i think let's turn to uh i just wanted to put the title here in front of you restoration continues while you're seated let's turn to joel chapter one this is uh just our second scripture and our last one i think maybe we'll turn to tonight but just while we're all seated and coming to our place how many since the atmosphere of the lord jesus here tonight joel chapter one verse one you can bring up the scriptures brother we'll come back to the slides this is something that peter on the day of pentecost picked up and joel in acts chapter 2 this is joel chapter 1 verse 1. the word of the lord that came to joel the son of ptl hear this ye old men and give ear o ye inhabitants of the land has this been in your days or even in the days of your fathers have you seen this tell you your children of it and let your children tell their children and their children another generation so can we all agree tonight something that's real is able to be passed on this promise is unto you and to your children and to your children's children brother john's father is a minister of the gospel and a a believer of this message my grandfather was a believer of the message i have two sons and one daughter they're believers of this message we have three grandchildren that i believe lays the seed of god we're now four and five generations within them's message we're living out joel chapter one verse three and so are many of you here in this building how many have been mostly raised in the message just raise your hand mostly look at this brothers look at this brothers my my my look at this little jason you missed that just keep your hand raised uh if you've been raised in the message i'm just going to let my shadow come over brother jason god bless you brother god strengthen our brother jason tonight joel chapter one verse three tell your children of it let your children tell their children and their children another generation verse four that which with the which the palmer worm has left have the locust eaten and that which the locusts have left have the tanko worm eaten and that which the cankerworm has left had the caterpillar eaten these were spirits these were locusts these were spirits that were sent out to eat away at the fruit and eat away at the fellowship and eat away at god's peace in your life the joy in your life the experience of god these locusts that were sent out and and verse chapter 2 verse 23 now let's just move into joel chapter 2 verse 23 we're speaking about restoration tonight and i will restore this this is the atmosphere of of uh vessel tabernacle youth camp tonight be glad then you children of zion and rejoice in the lord your god for he has given you the former rain moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain that's the teaching rain and the latter rain that's the harvest rain in the first month or they're going to be coming together at the same youth camp you're going to have teaching preaching you're going to have god just working in justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost the word is going to be filling hearts while they hear the word they're going to be filled with the holy ghost somebody that has cancer has a tumor i think our sister phillips last night came forward but she said i want to give a testimony god healed me during the service sister philip stand is that true just wave your hand praise be to god hallelujah this is now in the first month these this is going to be happening in the same season verse 24 and the floors shall be full of wheat that's the word and the fats shall overflow with wine and oil that means the containers those things that are within the house of god wine is stimulation from revelation and oil is a type of the holy ghost that means in our meetings they shouldn't be dead and boring and dry the word ought to be flowing ought to bring stimulation to young people to teenagers to people in their 20s there ought to be joy and excitement at the hearing of the word no we're not at a football game or a rock concert we're not shopping tonight and we're not in a spa we are on the front lines battling the enemy enemy but we are victorious and in that atmosphere is going to be stimulation it's going to be the holy ghost coming to young hearts the same experience that your mother's got and your father's got and your minister's god and i i met him in my motel room they love to be here tonight brother matthew mother jason if we would have had a a building for six seven hundred people i think there would have been people that would have driven and come here to be in these services but it's mostly young people here we are tonight almost just 400 of us god has brought us together for such a time as this for different churches and different families and different walks of life because he predestinated and he knows that restoration is going through this building right now the same fire of god that birth your parents that came maybe years ago in their meetings and in their services my wife gave her a heart to the lord in a meeting in new zealand when brother donnie reagan and brother uh harold gilderbrandt was preaching she'd been raised in a christian home her father was a pastor but there came a certain day when the lights came on and we can be in the message brother john was raised in the branham tabernacle from a little boy heard the words of william branham but there had to come a day when the lights came on just a 12 year old boy a month before i was 13. they said is there anyone here that would like to be baptized and i raised my hand and i was baptized that night brother elliot and i have never been the same from that night i remember going back to school the next morning there wasn't pillars of fire there weren't angels but i just knew that something was different i had done what the word had asked us to do and from that time it's just been a growth this has been a seasons and i i feel i really had my word birth some years later as we were under the impact of the word of god at cloverdale bible ways and as in a little love church many young people and hearts had come to the lord and people were moving because there was a stir of god and there was life within the assembly just like i since right now in this meeting i just feel the pulsation of the holy spirit it's the prayers of others that are like odors coming before the lord i believe in those prayers and we see in verse 12 25 god sent in a prophecy of i will restore to you the years do we have that on the street i will restore to you the years just keep that up that brothers restoration this is our title i will restore means i'm going to bring back to you your ought to be conditioned i'm going to bring you back to where you ought to be let's all say restoration re-store is like repentance or revival you've heard all of these phrases revival repentance redemption is christ bringing you out of but it's him taking you into it's two parts it's god bringing you out of the world out of yourself now 20 years ago would have been at conventions and meetings and they said come out of denominations come out of baptist come out of catholic come out of pentecostal denominations most young people in the message don't even know what a denomination is so it's time that the ministry today jump down into the ditches as it was and start to talk the language of the hearts that we can connect with this new generation to be able to say things that will connect with our hearts not their minds but in their hearts they can see that god's alive he's present not just by pictures or quoting but to be able to bring that presence so near that they can want what we've got that they can desire the god that not that we're pointing to but we're bringing him to them [Applause] so restore means to bring back it means to bring you back to your place that god had in his mind about you it is him coming to you at your season at your time and making it so real for you let's look in verse 25 and i will restore to you the years that the locusts have eaten the tank worm and the caterpillar and the palm oil my great army which i sent among you and you shall eden plenty verse 26. have you enjoyed the food here at the camp here is everybody doing okay breakfast lunch supper did y'all eat okay today half of you did y'all eat okay today brother john bypass those couple meals so i could be in better shape for you tonight but we're talking spiritually verse 26 you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the lord your god that hath dwell wondrously with you i just want to speak to you just for a moment has god been wonderful to you has god been good to you i mean what more can god do for us to get us ready to go in the rapture is anybody listening tonight what more ministry what more effects i mean some of you come from homes maybe that are broken or in trouble but i i speak for most of you you have a pretty good life it's comfortable god has met your needs more than enough in fact we become so unthankful and we take things for granted and i pray that in meetings like this god would just break that out of us that we would say god i acknowledge you and what you've done in my life you've worked wondrously with you and verse 26 says and my people shall never be ashamed my young people shall never be ashamed i'm not adding to the word i'm bringing bethel tabernacle youth right into it now there's no reason for you to be ashamed i have this later in my notes but i might as well just say it right now you know as ministers we deal in the last years or so with prayer lines and secret expressions when young people come to the front and we hear a lot about suicide we hear a lot about the spirits that would satan would try to plague the young people with in our generation pornography wrong music and wrong movies they battle fashion they battle how they look and and the perception of others they you know their nails or their looks and their face and or how they just look and it just seems like satan has put an epidemic on young people to care about how you look so much more that they lose their the appetite in that real how does god think about you but i just want to say tonight you are accepted in the beloved our sisters don't have to wear makeup or cut their hair to be beautiful [Applause] i think we just ought to knock that suicide spirit right out of the building we've been in a lot of prayer lines this last year so after this covet pandemic has come through it's not a local thing it's a global thing i just got back from europe i had to be tested three times for that one trip two times going and one time coming i know what it's like and my wife sits back there probably more tested than anybody in this room probably without exaggeration crossing back and forth into canada to see our daughter a lot but let me tell you what friends suicide has tried to plug the young people of the message satan trying to tell you your life is worthless or just take your life and you're no good and i'm here tonight to tell you god loves you you're accepted in the beloved life is worth living god sees beyond the now he's trying to lift up your eyes out of the dust and out of just the now that you're seeing and look above look above the now catch a vision of the word it's continuing it's passing through this building right now that's our title of restoration continues i've heard it over and over young men and even young ladies plagued with pornography and looking at things that are not right let me tell you what friends that is not an attribute of the holy spirit homosexuality lesbianism beastology whatever you satan may try to plague your mind with is not of the holy ghost and it's meetings like this we need to say it it can be right in the room and people are afraid to talk about it ministers afraid to say it and i pray god help all of us from the youngest to the oldest there's no big eyes or little you there's not a person in this service or streaming the service that's better than anybody else you might be down the road you might have traveled in the message but we need to learn to humble ourselves and knock out all that arrogancy and pride you say well i've been there done that no you haven't i just read a quote today of brother branham he said our children our sons do you know that your boys fathers have it ten times worse than you ever had that's a quote of brother branham i had it on my wall for years in my office just to always remind us as we've spoken to a lot of young people over the years they have it 10 times harder than i ever did and then if you're if you have grandchildren that's 10 times 10 what is it for our grandchildren i'm speaking to the children of the children in the message we have not been there we have not done that brother john stands in the pulpit tonight i've never drank i've never smoked i've never took drugs but you i'm looking in the faces of a generation that has it much harder than i ever had you're dealing with things emotionally when you're eight years old and 10 years old things that are putting blatant out there when brother john would have had to go to a store or go to a special place to look into it's at the fingertips of our children and our sons and i say god save our young people send down the holy spirit so strong in our meanings that while the waters being stirred joel chapter 1 verse 26 the last part of it says and my people shall never be ashamed verse 27 and ye shall know that i am in the midst of israel that i am the lord your god and none else and my people shall never be ashamed and this message came forth with shouting crying grace grace it's like a double portion it's like god knew that we needed not just grace we need grace grace i'm standing here on august i'm sorry october the 29th saying we need grace but we need grace grace and the message of the hour will meet in time conditions the holy spirit is standing there tonight with his sword drawn to defeat the enemy and if you feel the least tug of his spirit don't turn it away if you just feel the least little desire for god i would respond to that how many believe in miracles just raise your hand how many have a desire for more of god do you know what friends that is a miracle you all believe in miracles we just saw a lot of miracles young ladies and young men and a whole room full of people that actually want god lord we love you tonight lord jesus we want to serve you with all of our hearts yes my people shall never be ashamed verse 28 excuse me for taking this time but this is probably going to be our last scripture before we go to our sides and it shall come to pass afterward and i will pour out my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy how many can read that in the bible they shall prophesy not cussing not swearing not the newest movie not the latest chad they're going to be caught up in a spirit of prophecy sons and daughters in the message your old men shall dream dreams and your young men shall see visions and it's not television or it's not gaming or it's not you too but it's a vision of the holy spirit it's god breaking through it's better than a basketball star or a football player when he takes off his helmet he's got big earrings and tattoos all up and he's on his second or third girlfriend our wife and he's an abuser god's given us brothers and sisters in this room that love you we love one another verse 28 speaks about afterward all these things after the uh tanker worm locust caterpillar and palmer worm has tried to eat away after all these things i'm going to pour out my spirit in verse 29 also upon the servants and upon the handmaids and in this those days will i pour out my spirit the campers the counselors the team the ministers the fathers the mothers those that would love to be here in this service but they're streaming or will see this service i will show verse 30 wonders in heavens and in the earth blood and fire and pillars of smoke the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon and the blood before the great and terrible day of the lord come and it shall come to pass that whosoever let's all say whosoever brother brother said that word whosoever it means you because if he would have said john or mary or susan or wesley and someone else's name could have been wesley or susan he said whosoever shall call on the name of the lord shall be delivered this scripture is so powerful it's it's quoted again in acts chapter 2 whosoever shall call upon the name of the lord shall be saved it's quoted again in romans whosoever shall call upon the name of the lord not maybe not hope so now i'll watch you after camp for about a week or so and see if it was just an emotion no whosoever shall call upon the name of the lord [Applause] i don't think you're getting it tonight shall be saved [Applause] brothers if you can bring up our slides i wanted to now continue in this story this service tonight i don't want tonight's meeting to be a a sermon i want it to be an experience i'm taking you on a journey after going through many prayer lines and hearing secret things of young people they're battling friendships they're battling relationship issues school things work things things in the family things in the church things that are happening and young people they struggle with these things they see it too but i'm going to take us now on a journey i'm gonna go back to the first of this year around february brother john begin to notice in the ministries around the message this inspiration of restoration it was like after almost a year if we included china this covered virus started to spread throughout the globe and now after over a year which has started in january february in china but now i begin to notice in february ministers started to pick up this on inspiration on i will restore saith the lord then we move through april eastern may and it begin like this restoration restore i will bring back i will give you back all the years and where they have struggled and where they have fought and where they have battled it began to catch a hold of mothers and fathers and laborers in the in the local assemblies i will restore saith the lord april now may this begin to become a burden i will restore until one house it begin to be notes all throughout the house can everyone see that on the screen a bird and mother a burden father remember i'm dedicating this service to bethel tabernacle but it's for all of us here tonight just to participate in restoration and how it's continuing i will restore saith the lord this is above the master bedroom this is in the children's room this promise write it upon the bedpost write it upon the walls tell your children let it be a burden from the pulpits till it gets into the church till it gets down into where the young people are hearing this i will restore saith the lord it moved to the microwave where you put popcorn where you put things to warm it up it was like a burden i will restore it wasn't a man it wasn't the preacher it was god changes it was god saying i'm gonna bring you back it was god saying what i had in my mind what i had in my thoughts i'm going to bring back to you and somebody caught that burden way back in this year and it began to roll through the house i will restore saith the lord it went on to mirrors of the house can you imagine going into your bedroom going into the bathroom seeing this promise of i will restore saith the lord here it is on the on on a mirror and this isn't funny this is a burden this is something now moving through the bride as groanings as travailings it's burst pains it's i'm going to speak on it tomorrow night it's called spiritual contractions it's holy first inside of a person and they can't explain it and they can't time it it's just happening it's god moving saying now is the time now is the hour now is the season i put the seed there but now it's time for it to be born i will restore as a promise in joel peter picked it up on the day of pentecost saying this is that now i'm bringing it up to 2021 saying the same holy ghost was moving now globally we see it now on the refrigerator who's ever been in the refrigerator before about half of you come on everyone this is a believer's youth camp amen we want to see it we want to hear it we're going to put it before them this is fulfilling deuteronomy put it on your bed post talk about it in your uprising when you go through the house it's not all about your job it's not all about your career it's not all about your good looks can you imagine staring into a mirror every morning and saying i will restore screaming back at you you talk about the love of god it's a lot better than rock and roll music playing through the house come on young people it's a it's a lot better than a mother cursing you and telling you you're no good you're never gonna amount to nothing it's a lot better than what brother williams had to deal with in his testimony of a father standing with a gun wanting to destroy life i doubt there's a handful of people that's ever even seen a father take a gun and point it at their mother brother burly williams did we stand here as witnesses i will restore i'm going to bring you back i'm going to bring all of those hurts and all of that pain all of that broken heartedness and all that loneliness that you've been dealing with even in this last year and a half i will restore i'm going to bring it all back to you in the same season oh it's on the refrigerators it's on the windows you kind of look out through the trees you're trying to look out the window brother jason and you see something written on the way i will restore say the lord can't get away from it you can't run from it you can't hide from it it's on the walls it's tucked up to the walls i will restore saith the lord i say god give us more houses like that that was april and may we came in june this is june the 11th 2021 on the first friday night brother john didn't know none about these signs didn't know anything about this inspiration didn't know nothing about this being written on bedpost and windows and refrigerators had no clue and the very first service we stood up on the friday night under the inspiration of the holy spirit i will restore saith the lord restored youth it was like a promise that's when i heard brother matthew give the testimony that that very scripture all the way back from february all the way april may now a visiting minister comes through in invisible tabernacle and the very first inspiration is joel chapter 2 25 i will restore to you the years that the locusts have eaten the cankerworm and the caterpillar and the palmer my great army which i sin among you i can say praise god there's a mind of the lord [Music] [Applause] and just toward the end of the service i want to give another testimony about something that was happening within hours of the service this was a friday night and already in europe it was already saturday but in the saturday afternoon there was a whole new incredible thing that happened on june the 12th and i want to close with that inspiration to let you know god's working globally the very hours it's not just here in south carolina this weekend it is happening globally brother john can say as a minister in the last six months that we have traveled full-time evangelism around the united states and been at youth meetings and local churches and then into europe just a few weeks ago the same inspiration and the same revival and the same spirit of god that is collecting our children and our young people is in this building tonight the same atmosphere the same pulsation and desire of you reaching out and thirsting and hungry and you don't even know why it's the holy ghost restoring so what was that it caused this inspiration what was it that would cause a burden of a mother a microwave on windows on mirrors on the refrigerator near the door it's like the token it's like it's like brother john i can't get away from this there's blood all over the door you know friends this message is not a bunch of quotes and volumes and sermons this message is christ and i wonder sometimes if we're really getting our young people to christ my wife is a very wonderful believer she's very burdened i'm very happy to have her this weekend she doesn't travel with brother john very much but she wanted to come sister rachel she wanted to come in june and she wanted to be here this weekend and last night it was almost midnight we're laying in the bed and she's just burning for the young ladies we just sat back there and saw everyone coming in and young lady i'll begin the week i'll be honest with you i was sitting right there on the aisle and i just began to weep as you came in as brothers begin to find their places and i just saw how you were coming into the presence of god brother john just began to weep my wife at midnight just saying honey when i saw the young ladies today she where the mic took us back to our room after the morning service and sister sharon wanted to stay she wanted to be with you she wanted to be at the volleyball court at the soccer court she wanted to eat lunch she wanted to be around the young people she went on the great big swing brother and face god she can't hardly sleep last night her arms are all achy they're all achy she says what it is finally this morning brother burley on the way to the service she said you know what i think it is it's because i was worshiping so much last night i was praising god i tell you we need more meetings like that hallelujah you all know how the welsh revival started in wales in the early 1900s there was a bunch of young people it wasn't that a an ordinary service it wasn't a regular service it was young people that saw the deadness in the church and they started to gather and have prayer meetings and gather and wanted to see a revival there were poor they were poor there were young men that worked in the coal mines and young people that were in churches that were dead brother jason and they were teenagers that said we've got to have a revival we we want to see a stir of god and in one of those services there was a young lady that was 17 18 years old i know when they dim the lights it makes everybody tired but just stay with us are y'all doing okay don't fall asleep on us amen yeah just shake your head amen thank you brother it was a 17 or 18 year old young lady she stood up in one of those meetings and just raised her hands and said lord jesus i love you with all of my heart and the holy ghost fell in that meeting and from that revival from that service streaked a whole welsh revival that brought over a hundred thousand souls to christ in wales because a young lady and young people said we must have a revival young people brother john's 49 years old i feel like i'm over the hill i said to my wife i think yesterday the day before we were having uh reading scripture and praying for these meetings together and i said honey we're about over the heel we're middle aged at least i admit that what are y'all laughing for when i was your age you looked to people to say he's old he's old he's 49 he's old he's almost 50 he's out putting out the pastor somewhere the thing about it is i know that it's true some of my better years are behind as it was and you young people the baton is in your hands now that's why i'm not preaching at you i'm preaching with you you're the church of today and i pray from these meetings and this weekend they would spawn pastors and ministers trustees and deacons and piano players and organ players and young men and young ladies that are on fire with god and i promise you for myself we're not going to try to stop you we're not going to be like david's old older brothers that were saying you naughty boy you naughty boy what are you doing delivering these cheeses and these breads get you back and get you back no they should have been the ones defeating the enemy i i pray god raised up more david's among us that in spite of the souls of the older people that you rise up in the humility of the anointing of god and take off the head of that goliath there shouldn't be one person discourage a young person from serving the lord there shouldn't be one elder in this message speak negatively about a young person that's trying to serve the lord we're here to pick you up this weekend do something for god do all you can for god don't wait until the candles have lit when god lights your flame you move under that inspiration and have a walk with god where you don't need the roar of the crowd and the thousands cheering you on but you can stand alone this past week i was reminded by another person that is also a minister but they came out of denominations they came out of the world they came out of and they spoke about the pressures and the rejection of what they had to go through in their fathers their mothers and in the churches they attended and they talked about how people wrote them off and said wrong things about them that was from denominations into the message but as the years go by we've seen the same decline and i pray god take that spirit out of all of us tonight but we would never speak negatively or speak against another believer but we would always encourage and always be one that would say what can we do for the lord that is the spirit of the holy ghost that was the spirit on the prophet that i hear every day i hear brother branham every day and even throughout the night my wife will tell you this that was the spirit of our prophet he would always encourage he was always what more can we do what was it in the mother that wrote this on her window why would she write and put a hole in her wall with a photo or with a picture of i will restore what was that then just a few weeks ago now i'm speaking tonight on restoration continuing this is in belgium we're young people just it was a small group from holland and almost all dutch-speaking young people i'm gonna go now into the next part of the service we had special meetings and then this is the saturday morning session are we doing okay it wasn't a service it was a time for the young people to speak and the pastor had felt led to speak about the covet 19 virus and their response the young people how they had gone through these last 18 19 months the whole session was them speaking to us and sharing from their heart what they had gone through you know the first question was about the virus how this pandemic what they felt and the very first comment was we're sick of it who's been sick of it well the rest of you probably are sick i hope you're not sick with it we cast that demon far away from here tell you meetings like this have been criticized in the last several months burden pastors and churches have had meetings like this and then there'll be a wave of this crazy spirit try to take out assemblies that was the best place those young people could have been you put me in the presence of god any day i'll say it like david let's give david the microphone what do you think about it well a day in thy courts is better than a thousand with the wicked a thousand days is almost three years give me one day in the presence of god is better than three years with the wicked that was a young man that was anointed under the message of his day and he knew how to get away from javelins and he knew how to run and he knew where to go he was on his way to the throne he had already been prophesied over he had been born and raised and anointed by a prophet's message and nothing was going to stop him not a soul not his big brothers and not a goliath and not goliath's brothers it's time for us to raise up and know our position you're not little babies anymore young people a besting in tabernacle youth camp you're not a little baby anymore you're not a child you need to cut the apron strings with your mother and father just lean on that whatever they say whatever my pastor says it's not what do you believe and don't misunderstand i know those people that stream or will stream the service and they misunderstand and they twist and they misconstrue we're not even part of that we're of one mind and one accord lord send a restoration through the service lord may lives that are empty be filled may hearts that have been wounded be restored be lives that are empty be healed and hearts that are full let them just pour it out so that more of god can come in and maybe a little bit will just spill over the top in the book of acts people's shadows were healing the people they were having meetings where where the word was being spoken and lives are being filled with the holy ghost while they heard the word that was the type of service we had last night and that's the type of service that it ought to be more regular where we hear the word we receive the word and god infills us and for the rest of the service it's like a whole new dynamo happen it's like a ball of fire came down the pipe you all want me to go on should we play so we got around the tables with the young people the young men and the young ladies this is the pastor speaking to them speaking about their connection the young people begin to talk about how they couldn't go to church in the last 18 19 months that they couldn't be together i've got about five or six pages of notes of their comments i'm not going to read them all but i just wanted you to know what other young people have gone through the same last months that they've gone through many of you feel the same they begin to speak about how people become separated because of this virus and how all the rules and regulations brought instability and actually brought more fear to the people they talked about how people are afraid and the difficulties about their experiences with this whole thing young people in the message begin to express for the country their feelings of fear how they couldn't go on holiday trips and they were concerned that their grandparents would be afflicted no church services no youth meetings days were long there was no school because a lot of schools were shut down and family visits were cut off and the wearing of masks and the social distancing they caught social but it's anti-social really all the distancing you all are really quiet tonight that's how the world responds they want a distance they don't want to get further away that was exactly what satan wanted to have happen the distance they began to talk about their it just seemed like their life went on pause for a little while it was like they went on sleep mode nobody's ever heard of sleep mode like sleeping mode how they thought about things they they begin to ponder and meditate their social contacts they talked about conspiracy theories and in the politics and the scientists and people saying well follow the science and follow the politics it even crept into message pulpits people saying well if you have the holy ghost you wouldn't get the virus till it started to fit to them or someone in their church then they backtrack really fast let me tell you what that's nothing but a lie from the devil a holy ghost-filled person can get a disease can have cancer can have high blood pressure that is no indication tonight if satan is tempting you with spirits of of the world but you have you you are not a believer you are a son and you are a daughter of god and you need to shake yourself tonight to shake yourself [Music] we begin to speak about these things we talked about how they talked about streaming services versus live services and how they were taken from their live services and now being forced to stream and how they felt about that how did you all feel about that you didn't like it they talked about how being in a dedicated place of worship like a church or like meetings like this is so much more different than when you're just in your home yes we're believers at home yes we have the holy ghost yes we can raise our hand i'm not speaking about that this was young people expressing how different it was to be in live services where even when we're streaming at home there was distractions and it was more comfortable they talked about being falling asleep these are supposed to be services this anointed preaching and then people are left at home and you know then people go up to the room you say no it was just as good brother we feel closer to god now you know what friends if i was speaking to a age 40 and up group there's a lot of older ones that can maintain and maybe stream and last longer than young people can okay i'll say it amen brother john but for a family with children and young people it's not the same we need live services and yes for a season and yes for a time but there ought to be a desire to get right back into the church and get right back in the fellowship i'm speaking tonight on restoration continues if you have a local church to go to that are having services you ought to be there next sunday stop being somebody that just hangs out and using a virus for an excuse you're more safer in the presence of god young people talked about this and you know it's amazing how the same ones that were so against having live services and we need to be so careful we need to be careful you'd see them at walmart and costco and out there and they're dude they got a shop it's essential don't y'all understand we gotta fill our refrigerator we gotta have diapers we gotta have food the same ones that wouldn't come to church and wouldn't press through the unbelief and the fear that paul said gather yourself so much more as you see the day approaching they'll they'll be just happy pushing their little buggy and rubbing shoulders with someone they don't know that person from no i know brother jason but they don't know that check out person since when did walmart trump the presence of god don't meet the house of god and don't beat being in live services thank god that we can have meetings like this and if there's any person that it would even cross your mind that we have 400 people in a small little room all packed together and you're just saying well maybe colvin's going to strike them and i hope it does shame on you you're not even a believer you don't even have the holy ghost i didn't say if you think that i said if you continue to ponder like that and keep away you're not walking with the nature of the holy ghost as the manner of some are we ought to get right back in and say lord bring us back together again [Applause] they talked about how testing testing for the virus brought stress to them and i know what that's like who else knows what it's like to have a little cough have a fever do i have it do i have it or about a third of you who knows what i'm talking about and you got to get tested you got to get tested you got to quarantine you got to be away and satan will come right in and bring fear you're going to die you're going to do this brother jason demars can you stand to your feet this is a man that was in icu just a few days ago but restoration continued hallelujah let's stand and give god a standing ovation restoration continue hallelujah you may be seated and i don't want to embarrass anyone and brother john's a minister i understand there's privileges and health privileges and you talk to a doctor you don't tell things you talk to a nurse you talk to a minister it should be private but i wonder who in this building would be at least unashamed to say i also had that covet spirit but i'm here to stand in the presence of god and say satan couldn't take me i'm here and i'm going to serve god would you stand to your feet somebody that had covered but god healed you i'm standing just look around the room well you're not standing you're not standing nope i'm standing i had cloven in february of 2020. the god rich and mercy knew we needed to be standing here tonight and there's some that have gone on to their rewards but kova didn't take them i said coven didn't take them i'm sure there's somebody who already logged off of youtube a long time ago covet never took one believer god allowed them to go it was their time to go and whatever would take a believer is just lit it's just like hitching up a cart and taking you into that other dimension now friends the reason we're having services tonight is so that if you're not ready to go god would be able to give you that experience you can say i'm ready to go god bless you all that stood and those that didn't stand god thank you for healing you and delivering you he's our healer restoration healing is in the house and i'm not telling a story it's real we're alive we're we're restoration is what god's mind was about you what his thoughts are about you you're living you're breathing tonight to give god glory i'm just continuing about our notes about the young people in europe and at least three or four times for the burley they talked about loneliness and it was a lot of the sisters actually young ladies talked about throughout the last year and a half how the loneliness and the distancing and being in your room and having to do zoom or teams or you know you couldn't go to school hardly you couldn't now you're in your room now you're at your computer and just the loneliness i'm all alone i'm i'm in this room alone young people with the holy ghost shared about how loneliness they felt alone that's when that inspiration of the holy spirit comes upon you are not alone you are not alone i'm there with you i will go before you you are not alone you are not alone i am there with you i've already gone before you i am not alone i am not alone he is there before me he is there inside me not a song but now it's personal but i am alone by the john don't you see me in my room don't you see me in my i have to do school the young peoples are canceled the church is cancelled i am alone then the holy spirit begins to breathe you are not alone you are not alone young people begin to speak about this and the anxious moments and the their emotion how it just seemed like this was not going to end and then it started with a wave and it was going to get better and then another wave it's like lord and it caused anxiousness and it caused fear upon good young people believers of the message they struggled with feeling anxious and nervous and the holy spirit is just pulsating there saying breathe breathe breathe it's like being born coming through after nine months through and we'll get into this tomorrow night it was birthing you pain and suffering here you came out and it's like breathe you've got to breathe if you don't breathe you're going to die if you're going to stay there you're going to die breathe tonight i'm encouraging you in this friday night service breed young people breathe just stop for a moment i want every person to just breathe take a breath now you know exactly you that stood earlier and you that have studied this you that are in medical know this is one of the main things about covet is take it tries to take your breath away and it'll cause your heart to just start and it'll start filling with your lungs where you cannot breathe what you from a little girl from a little boy was so natural just breathe now becomes forced now becomes now brother john waking up in the middle of the night sweaty and sweaty and i'm having to prop myself up with pillows it's like breathe breathe it's like this demon is trying to take my life and i remember countless times going into our hallway into the bathroom standing in front of the mirror saying satan you cannot take my life i defy you some of us just need to be encouraging one another breathe breathe young ladies young men breathe soak in this atmosphere what you feel right now if you went downtown atlanta downtown l.a tonight or downtown new york uh i just heard it the other day of someone and they saw a young lady that was just going down the street just throwing up and she's just a beautiful but she had just been marred and she's just throwing up drunk and maybe stoned out of her mind satan just taking a virtuous life and lotting it up like a piece of paper and throwing it into the corner just to hang as a trophy on some beast bill oh i got another one i got another one and satan tried to destroy you like you did peter tried to sift him like wheat and he cursed and he swore and he said i don't even know the man well the way you're talking and the way you all been singing this weekend i think your message believer and peter is so upset he just cursed and he swore are y'all listening let's just fast forward 53 days okay that's thursday night friday morning he's cursing and swearing in front of a young lady one of the few times a maid and a young lady is mentioned in the bible was peter cursed and he swore thursday night and friday morning jesus died on the cross on friday and he arose on sunday i look into the faces of some of you tonight and maybe you're struggling i know a lot of your parents and a lot of your pastors and i love them dearly but sometimes we can have young ladies right around us and they're beautiful and they're lovely but they don't know the lord we can have young men that are handsome and young men that can be talking to talk and have a grandpa have a grand grandma or have a a mother or father that's a lovely believer and they can talk to you and be so wonderful but you can sense there's an emptiness there somewhere it's not the way it ought to be that's what we're groaning for tonight brother jason that's why we dedicated tonight's service to bethel tabernacle because from a womb and from a desire and from a hunger of this church came the sermon tonight god is still restoring god is still continuing god is going to save your children god is going to save your grandchildren god is going to save your friend your brother your sister someone in your cabin this weekend god is going to meet them can i continue on just a little bit these young people begin to express about what it did positively the last 18 months going on 19 months how the it caused them to appreciate the times with one another and to realize what it means to miss people it's like we couldn't be together a few months ago a few weeks ago this wasn't even possible it was against the rules it was against the regulations and these young people begin to speak about how they learn to appreciate the little things that have been taken away but now once god begins to restore and bring them back they begin to respect one another when satan wanted to bring a division they begin to be thankful it's like one said they took three steps back and they began to look at things and they became more grateful how they could give more time to one another and learn to deal with criticism and opinions of someone else that was different they was able to think deeply and be grateful for their health let me just pause in this service are we all doing okay you say you're not reading a lot of quotes you're not but friends i'm i'm right down here with you jesus is talking to you they begin to speak about how they were grateful for their health this is what uh i want every person to look around the room does anybody see any wheelchairs here any crutches anybody see anybody in a natural straight jacket come on i'm asking you all do you all see that i think we ought to thank god for our health say what am i supposed to do when i lose my health you praise him in the storm what do i do when i am all alone and i'm not with the crowd you praise him in the storm say what do i do when it seems like everything's falling everything's going negative everybody's against me you praising in the storm [Applause] i will praise you in this storm i will lift my hands cause you are who you are no matter where i get every tear i cry you hold in your hand you've never left my side hallelujah come on what's the next line though my heart is torn [Music] i'll praise you in my story hallelujah we begin to speak about this with just a little group brother jason it probably just would have been this little group over here maybe 50 70. it wasn't even a fraction of even those that are streaming tonight it's just a small little group but it gave brother john a little window to see that young people all over the globe another thing they mention is they begin to appreciate the smiles on people's faces with no more masks they discovered the smile of people i'm not against masks i'm not against that but when you take off the mask you can see the face and i think it should be 100 percent we love to see someone smile is that true i think i got about half of you with me they make you do it when you go through security it's like you got to pull down your mouth they want to see your face it's like i want to see the best part of you you don't start taking off your socks and show them your they want to see your face is that right god wants to see your face he wants to see you love him and enjoy him sometimes even in the house of god we get to a place where we become satisfied with a boring relationship with jesus and our atmosphere even in our meetings and our church in our homes can get so reckless with fighting and seeing the negative and talking about why we're heard and where we went wrong and somebody done somebody wrong song and it begins to be our theme and we need to change that tune we need to let the holy spirit come bursting through our lives young people early will i seek this early in my youth early in my life early in the morning early amen in the morning when i rise give me amen but let me let me just tell you i'm getting into your private life in a moment what most of you the first thing you look at is a little device you're so interested you just want to know you gotta somebody might have texted me or emailed me i gotta check my instagram or my facebook i got it what happened during the night he won that game or what do we got to do and we're just so focused on that's the first thing in the morning i wonder tonight if we can just say lord jesus i want to sanctify consecrate my life to you even the devices that you have i want to seek your face first look forward to his wonderful face i'm not preaching a sermon tonight i'm living in front of you a life and they begin to speak about this and talk about this now at the end of this session on on saturday morning the pastor felt led to turn to a certain scripture to just close it all out and this was we had friday night service this was saturday morning we had saturday night sunday morning this is saturday morning and he felt to read a scripture does anybody even want to guess what scripture it was joel chapter 2. and he read the scripture about i will restore and how in verse 28 joel 2 28 and 29 where it says afterward i will pour out my spirit can you just stay with me a little bit longer after the cancer worm after the palm or after the locust has come in now and tried to destroy you afterward i will pour out my spirit it's god saying i'm going to take away the shame from my people you will never be ashamed he says it twice you will never be ashamed after all of these years after all of these months of what satan has tried to distract you it was on the news it was on the papers it was on websites it was in your schools it was in your jobs it even affected message churches this virus i'm talking about i'm closing out on this virus praise the lord but i'm talking about restoration god looks beyond all of those things and at the end he says afterwards afterwards i will re i i will pour out my spirit it's like god is going to watch you and test you and see throughout this time and then afterwards i will pour out my spirit i say lord fulfill that scripture it was like the lord was wanting to break the chains of the enemy on the minds on the bodies and on the souls of his children and after all of these months after all of these years god was saying i will restore saith the lord [Applause] how many think that's wonderful from february early year april may june [Music] come a sister that wrote these notes all over her house please stand to her feet then it's not sister rachel alone it was a burden it was like birth pains it was like the groaning that the sisters are a reflection of the church the condition of a church is where the ladies are at it's where the young people are at i don't need to know what all of you believe but this weekend just looking into your faces brother branham said you can talk to a person for two minutes and tell whether they have the holy ghost or not and he said and you can too that's a direct quote he said i can talk to a person for two minutes and tell whether they have the holy ghost or not and you can too so we carry an atmosphere what we speak about what we talk about how we live our lives you say well brother john it looks like i'm just all eight away just my attitude the rebellion and god is saying it's like he overlooked all of that all the years and all the months and he's saying i'm looking beyond all of that and i'm saying i will restore saith the lord my goodness is gonna come after you regardless of how you feel where you're at i'm gonna find you i'm gonna come after you and i will restore you back let me just make this clear all of you that are in the back the helpers the parents and many older ones pastors and ministers we all had it difficult in the last year and a half since march 2020 till october now it's november on monday we've all had it let's get out of our pity parties stop living like a victim stop holding the victim card and not being an overcomer and saying it's well because it's this or it's that or i'm the only young person in my church or i'm the only one that is wanting to serve god in my family or i'm the only young person that's strong or this or that that's called a victim and you need to stop waving that before the lord tonight you need to wave your heart before the lord of praise and of worship may not give you my life i give you my praise and tomorrow night we're going to speak more along this line but right at the end of all of this god gives you a feast october to the jews is the month of the feast of tabernacles i'm going to speak on that tomorrow night i'm going to feast of speak about spiritual contractions in your booth a booth was what they were called to make before the feast of the tabernacles which was private it was small it was crude it was temporary but they were called to go into their individual booth it was it speaks of consecration it speaks of dedication we're going to read out leviticus and nehemiah when ezra stood up to read this in the book of nehemiah about we are to have booths the bible says they had not practiced that since the days of joshua which was 1 000 years the message had neglected personal consecration and dedication and they wanted a revival they wanted the feast but they had neglected the booth so tomorrow night i want to bring that out the spiritual contractions in your booth it's got to be personal it's got to be individual it's your consecration if you want to go on with god there has to be a start friends deliverance how many has ever seen someone delivered or been delivered it happens like it can happen in a moment do we believe in that it's like deliverance is like a miracle can be instant but restoration is a process that's what i'm speaking on tonight it takes time and i believe i think all of us believe in a spontaneous dynamic and feeling of the holy ghost every person that goes in the rapture the bride will receive a holy ghost revival do we believe that any any believer should embrace the power of the holy ghost if you're leaning toward being formal and indifferent well i'll let you finish it we need to run tonight to jesus christ i was thinking tonight about how precious it is that we can have meetings like this to be around people that actually love you that are cheering you on that someone's giving you the baton saying take it take it take it i'm not saying give me that microphone give me that bro who do you think you are take it run go what's the thus saith the lord to the bride so as we close tonight i wanted you to see that restoration takes time on these photos i'm going to show you this this doesn't take five minutes 10 minutes 30 minutes it takes time a miracle is instant a deliverance can happen like that but when you get up from the altar when you go back to school that's when restoration has to continue look at this how many has ever seen restoration of a building before it doesn't happen in a week or a weekend see this is where the ministry's got to realize that it's not a momentary blessing it's not just the just the momentary blessing we're trying to get the young people to it's the eternal deposit that will last far beyond this week we're trying to get you to love him [Applause] everybody wants to you know go out on friday night take drugs drink it up have a good time go to a sex party yeah we had a great time that's that's what the world does god forbid we bring that into the message just try to bring in you know just momentary blessings and momentary impulses and everybody amen that down on monday down i'm speaking to you next thursday i'm talking to you about next friday night restoration continues and i pray it continues for every person but you would catch that revelation i need that experience i need but i also need to go on from there look at this i mean it takes more than a few days to put the scaffolding up for the cadre look at this they're trying to this uh put you know roof on around this old clock and this little just putting the scaffolding up takes days in place people aren't willing to do that in the message they want a momentary hit give me something fast that's what you did in the world that's what the parents did and the elders did in the world i pray that we lay something into our young people that long after these lights are off and long after we've all gone home sunday and monday there's been something left in your heart i will go on i will go on [Applause] press on i just feel like the angel of the lord is here right now as you have your seats what i'm speaking about is beyond emotion but it includes emotion i know you are being seated so i don't want someone to on the internet to have a little blip there like we did at the beginning of the service and say is it buffering us but everything's common everybody's doing fine here is everybody doing fine what i'm speaking about is beyond emotion but it includes emotion in fact i pray god give us a double portion god give us more young ladies that'll stand up and say lord i love you with all of my heart [Applause] let's just get something very clear because we have older ones here also older people don't have it all together either we hear sermons about god's will and god's purpose and you've got to find it you've got to know for certain and all these things there's a lot of older people that are still trying to find god's will for their life and what job and where we should go and should we move to this they're making decisions and they're groaning what should we do lord what should we do so are our young people so we need to remove the facade it's called hypocrisy that puts out this strong image i've got it all together no you don't have it all together even the older ones we we're just one breath away we're just one breath away just talk to our miracle here brother there's just one breath away from going into that other side you talk about torment and most of you heard the testimony you talk about the anxiety you talk about a man sitting right over here that has the holy ghost that was tormented didn't even know if he was going to live to see sister amy or his family so if an older person brother matthew do you ever groan to find the will of god for your life is that yes oh my yes i'm trying to work with you brother brother brother cadre i mean okay brother burnley he was quick he knew brother jason do you pray for god's will and then why do we look down on our young people why do we speak so condescending to them they're trying to find their way sometimes even our church services we can make one another so nervous and it's like we have to conform it's like we have to be spiritual it's like we have to uh i'm not i'm not saying that's bad but i'm just saying we can make one another feel like yeah yeah yeah and really it's like they're groaning if you read the book of judges right after joshua it says after joshua and caleb and the generation that was with them passed away there rose up another generation that did not know the lord we're living in that generation being around the message and saying brother branham was a prophet and having good this and that and having good music is wonderful my wife loves your music i love it too she said it going home in the car last night i think i love their loud music i loved your loud music play it louder brother aaron hey man sister deb we're not at a funeral and this is a youth camp by the way it's beyond intellect but i encourage every person here tonight to receive the holy ghost when you look at this time of disaster and i'm coming down to the end here tornadoes damage comes snow begins to bring damage to a situation to a family to a life flooding fire maybe a business or your personal world just gets turned upside down sometimes you just need to take a step back and recover lord restore us i'm just praying right now how to close the service but i pray that the lord brother yawns answers this prayer lord restore all of our young people restore their minds the name of jesus christ may every wondering spirit be brought back into the right to be placed i'm standing here as a minister of the gospel may every spirit of our young ladies that has somehow wandered out there into a world and you're thinking things and you're going places that's not even real it's time for you to come back tonight and in the name of jesus christ we're coming after you there's any of our young men that are totally it's almost like they've gone insane it's almost like you look into their face and their eyes are just it's wandering eyes it's searching eyes it's looking eyes and you know if the rapture was tonight or tomorrow they would not go you know you sensed that and i wonder sometimes where is the holy ghost conviction in our meetings anymore where's our burden for one another i dedicated the service to bethel tabernacle and i told my wife driving home last night about this church i said the main thing i appreciate about them is they are real maybe it was when we got into our motel room i said they're real what you see is what it is there's not a big facade there's there's not a bunch of people playing the instruments for for fame there's not people grabbing the microphone and just trying to be on the next youtube channel splice vessel tabernacle god has honored you and blessed you because of your desire and i thank you for inviting all of us into this atmosphere that we could be healed when i tried to find some photos of restoration you can look on the pictures here quickly i'll go through these this doesn't take five minutes it doesn't take 30 minutes it's not when you go back to your cabin and then no you gotta there's holy ghost effort there's i'm not calling it works i'm calling about the nature of the holy spirit in a person is willing to stick to it when the music fades i still love the lord when the preachers are gone and they're and the way that they preach and the anointing that's on them but brother john's got to get an airplane monday morning at six o'clock with my wife and we've got to go back to another life too and it's not always easy and you don't always have everybody in the stands cheering you on and saying god bless you and patting you on the back but you and i have got to know that god is with us and like moses said unless god go not up with us we don't want to go if your presence don't go we don't want to go i encourage you to pray about it get counsel about it and pray a little more and then wait a little more and make sure you're neutral but when god speaks and when god says now is the time don't be a coward next thursday at your work or at school someone just puts it out there don't be a coward let the holy spirit strengthen you tonight and say i'm ready to go back into the lions but lord you promised you'd never leave me never forsake me do you have the time for restoration amen here it is you can look at it before and after photos i know you can hardly see that but you see this up here on the left you that are streaming it's on the top left that's not 50 000 100 000 that's millions of dollars of restoration and if the world can pour that into a building if an investor can pour that in and have a vision are you getting it somebody in the world can say i'm going to turn this into that this is a before this is an after what the power of god can do in your life where are you tonight there might be weeds growing up there might be cracked windows there might be all kinds of things look at this in 1948 on the left-hand side in new york city there was a a certain house you can see it there the astoria then as time went on it digressed in the middle you can see the boarded up windows and the horrible it just decayed but on the right hand side you can see after restoration what can happen when somebody's willing to pour in the time pouring the money i'm making an investment i tell you what friends all heaven is here to back you up tonight some of you that are into cars look at this on the left hand side there's rust and there's all kinds of just looks horrible you wouldn't want to drive that car but on the right hand side you see the tires you see the paint it's been restored spiritually if they can do that to an automobile what can god do in your life i just say lord place your hand upon my life god's got all eternity so he's not rushing it and there's not one person that's going to miss the rapture that was supposed to be there so you just need to tonight stop letting the devil push you to the brink where you're almost losing your mind and you feel so nervous and upset and he's telling you you don't have the holy ghost there's not been anything good happened to you as a fake and you're missing out on life after tonight you ought to just turn that around and say he's still working on me i might not be where i ought to be but god's not finished with me yet on the left hand side you can see the outside of this house this condo but after some renovations and restoration look on the right hand side who likes it on the right hand side who likes that okay all the sisters okay who likes it on the right-hand side who would like that half of you because who wants to live on the left-hand side and that's how oh you do you're brave you're brave she's humble okay brothers if you married a fine young lady and you had the opportunity of the one on the left or the one on the right which would you want to move her into wow can i have your number you don't want to give me your number it's yeah i won't go there this is from the inside i mean you're looking out from this room it's fine
