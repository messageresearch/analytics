[4:55] the book of james
[4:57] and i got quite a bit of feedback from
[4:59] it
[5:00] and i just trust it was a blessing so we
[5:01] just want to go just one step further
[5:04] james chapter 1
[5:06] and we're just going to begin reading
[5:08] here at verse 1
[5:10] and you could put that on the screen if
[5:11] you want there we go good
[5:13] james
[5:15] a servant of god
[5:16] and of the lord jesus christ to the 12
[5:19] tribes which are scattered abroad
[5:21] greeting
[5:22] my brethren count it all joy when you
[5:25] fall into diverse temptations knowing
[5:27] this
[5:28] that the trying of your faith worketh
[5:31] patience
[5:32] but let patience have her perfect work
[5:35] that you may be perfect an entire
[5:37] wanting nothing
[5:39] if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of
[5:41] god that giveth to all men liberally and
[5:44] and abradeth not
[5:46] and it shall be given in him
[5:48] it shall be given him verse 6 but let
[5:51] him ask in faith nothing wavering for he
[5:54] that wavereth is like a wave of the sea
[5:56] driven with the wind and tossed for let
[5:59] no man
[6:00] think that he shall receive anything of
[6:02] the lord a double mind a double-minded
[6:05] man is unstable in all his ways
[6:08] verse 9 let the brother of low degree
[6:10] rejoice in that he is exalted but the
[6:14] rich and he is made low
[6:16] because as the flower of the grass
[6:19] he shall pass away
[6:21] for the sun is no sooner risen with a
[6:23] burning heat but it withereth the grass
[6:26] and the flower thereof filleth falleth
[6:29] and the grace of the fashion of it
[6:31] perisheth so also shall the rich man
[6:33] fade away in his ways
[6:36] blessed is the man that endure
[6:38] temptation for when he's tried he shall
[6:40] receive the crown of life which the lord
[6:42] hath promised to them that love him you
[6:45] can be seated
[6:47] i wanted just to read some passage out
[6:49] of the book of james
[6:51] lest we just teach so much on it we
[6:53] don't cover any of its content and we
[6:56] took last i don't want to recap and
[6:58] spend time recapping
[7:00] too much about the book of james you'll
[7:02] you can get that in the archive if you
[7:04] missed the first part
[7:06] but i thought it was incredible to take
[7:08] uh a human look at
[7:11] this man james and we studied and looked
[7:14] at who he was being that there was
[7:16] multiple james in the bible
[7:19] five different men are called james and
[7:21] we looked at which one of these wrote
[7:24] the book of james
[7:26] and i think it's pretty incredible and
[7:28] profound
[7:29] when you study the bible
[7:31] not just for the divine
[7:33] and for the ethereal and the revelated
[7:36] things but also the bible is a very
[7:39] human book it's a very natural book it
[7:42] has
[7:43] has such a uh there is there isn't a
[7:46] there is absolutely an appeal to
[7:48] doctrine and
[7:49] uh to revelation
[7:51] and to teaching
[7:53] but i believe what makes it to me what
[7:55] makes the bible so special and so true
[7:59] is how human it is how real it is how
[8:03] much it answers your question every day
[8:06] of your life
[8:08] the book of james is really what we
[8:10] could call the most practical book i
[8:12] would say in the entire bible
[8:14] it's just christian living on a
[8:16] practical way but we looked at who this
[8:18] man was and we determined that the
[8:20] writer in my opinion and could be wrong
[8:23] was the brother of jesus
[8:25] and it was amazing looking at the life
[8:28] of jesus and how that his own family his
[8:31] brothers and his sisters didn't
[8:33] recognize him as the messiah through his
[8:36] throughout his entire earthly ministry
[8:37] it wasn't until after the resurrection
[8:39] even the bible speaks about his brothers
[8:41] picking on him and and saying you know
[8:44] this is the time of the feast why don't
[8:45] you go up and make yourself known and
[8:47] they were almost mocking him and it's
[8:50] incredible because the writer of this
[8:51] book of james was one of those brothers
[8:54] who were mocking one of the brothers of
[8:56] jesus his younger brother most likely
[8:59] uh the next yeah
[9:01] then i should say the next youngest yet
[9:03] jesus and then james
[9:06] and james is one of the men who's
[9:07] mocking him and
[9:09] it's amazing because the bible tells us
[9:12] and even his even uh you can go and look
[9:14] in josephus and some of the historical
[9:17] writings he writes about
[9:18] after the after the crucifixion
[9:21] how that
[9:22] the brothers and the siblings and the
[9:24] family
[9:25] are mourning they're they're they can't
[9:27] believe they can't believe what they've
[9:29] done they can't believe how that they've
[9:31] um you know the james i'm sure was
[9:34] pretty ashamed of himself
[9:36] and we talked about last last time
[9:39] how that james says i'm never going to
[9:41] eat again because of how ashamed and the
[9:44] shame that he bore i'm never going to
[9:46] eat another meal i'm just going to he
[9:47] was going to fast but it wasn't going to
[9:49] be a fast that was temporary he was
[9:51] going to fast until he died
[9:53] and just never eat again and and really
[9:56] james if if he would have followed
[9:58] through with what he said he was going
[9:59] to do he would have died and we wouldn't
[10:01] have the book of james
[10:03] it was pretty special when three days
[10:04] later jesus himself appeared to james
[10:08] and and the and james never again calls
[10:11] himself after after that appearing after
[10:14] the resurrection we find james chapter
[10:17] one
[10:18] let's look at it verse one
[10:20] james
[10:21] a servant of god
[10:24] now he's given himself this title
[10:26] and of the lord jesus christ to the
[10:29] twelve tribes so now james views himself
[10:33] as a servant
[10:36] we're gonna pause that just here for a
[10:37] moment just take a little detour here
[10:39] because it's just the way the lord
[10:41] inspired me and just led me to look uh
[10:44] through some of this and we're gonna
[10:46] look at some examples uh in the bible
[10:48] and we're not we're just gonna pause
[10:49] just from the history just for a moment
[10:52] and we're gonna talk about the content
[10:53] of the book
[10:55] it's incredible because everything that
[10:58] you find and i read the entire book of
[11:00] james again before i uh taught last week
[11:04] and it was amazing just notating making
[11:06] notes in my own uh document on james and
[11:09] i would encourage you to do the same go
[11:11] home and read the book of james from the
[11:13] beginning to the end
[11:15] and it's amazing how this testing or
[11:19] trying you could you could really
[11:21] you could call this book of james
[11:24] the acid test
[11:27] it was the test
[11:29] of
[11:30] true
[11:32] christianity
[11:34] because really what is when we say what
[11:36] is true christianity the truest and most
[11:39] purest form
[11:41] remember they were called christians
[11:43] first to antioch so there was something
[11:45] about their life they weren't as it
[11:46] wasn't
[11:47] jewish as acts 15 it's amazing james
[11:50] finds himself in the book of acts
[11:53] and you find the jerusalem council
[11:56] when certain pharisees
[11:58] are saying that you've got to be
[12:00] circumcised like moses and in order to
[12:03] be saved and the bible says they were
[12:05] jews
[12:07] who believed
[12:08] they were jews who believed so they were
[12:10] jews
[12:12] who believed in jesus messianic jews
[12:16] but these the bible says these were of a
[12:18] certain sect and they started teaching
[12:20] the brethren that you must be
[12:23] circumcised to be saved and so paul and
[12:26] paul and peter and barnabas
[12:29] the bible says that they hear of this
[12:31] and and they they hear of this teaching
[12:34] and then you have acts 15 which comes up
[12:36] to this entire
[12:38] meeting it was a minister's meeting and
[12:40] they called a they called a great
[12:42] meeting with paul and barnabas and peter
[12:44] and they're
[12:45] they're really it's it's amazing when
[12:47] you look at just the beginning origin of
[12:50] the christian church how it could have
[12:52] went either way christianity could have
[12:55] just remained a jewish sect
[12:59] or it could be
[13:01] a religion for the entire world
[13:04] and it could have went either way it
[13:06] could have went just as another jewish
[13:08] section if these men would have had
[13:09] their way in the entire jewish council
[13:11] if you read acts 15
[13:13] is discussing this topic
[13:16] and then you have peter and he speaks
[13:18] and he says brothers the lord has given
[13:21] it to me has given it to me has chosen
[13:24] me that i would take the gospel of
[13:26] christ to the gentiles first and then
[13:29] peter begins to testify and he says and
[13:31] he says and i'm a witness that when they
[13:34] heard the word in the houndies
[13:36] referencing the house of cleopas and he
[13:39] says he says when they when they heard
[13:41] the word
[13:42] they they received it and peter says or
[13:46] the house of cornelius and he says and
[13:48] when they received it peter says the
[13:50] holy ghost fell upon them
[13:54] the same way it did us
[13:57] and peter says and god made no
[13:58] distinction between jew and gentile
[14:01] there was there wasn't some special way
[14:03] that the gentile remember gentile that's
[14:06] a word we use in like a catch phrase
[14:07] word i'm a gentile and you take the you
[14:11] take the woman who says even the dogs
[14:13] you know get the bread from the master's
[14:15] table and so she's referenced as jin as
[14:17] a gentile if you go and look up the word
[14:20] you have jew and gentile i want to just
[14:21] clear this so it's forever clear in your
[14:23] mind what a gentile is you know what a
[14:25] jew is
[14:26] a gentile if you look up the n the
[14:29] meaning for the name
[14:30] in webster's this is what it means not a
[14:33] jew
[14:36] it's all it is
[14:39] we could have had a drum roll but we
[14:40] don't have the drummer out here
[14:43] it just means not a jew that's all it
[14:44] means it's any nation
[14:47] and that's important when you understand
[14:49] the distinction that the the
[14:51] the word of god
[14:53] came to the jews first
[14:56] and it will end with going back to the
[14:59] jews
[15:00] and so you could only come
[15:02] in the old testament you could only get
[15:04] to jehovah by coming through his
[15:06] emissary or his
[15:08] uh his his his representative which was
[15:11] the jewish nation
[15:14] so a gentile just means not a jew that's
[15:16] all it means nothing special not a jew
[15:19] and so they're they're saying this is
[15:21] what the entire jerusalem council was
[15:23] about
[15:24] how are we jews who receive this now how
[15:27] are the gentiles now in order for the
[15:29] gentiles you've got to be circumcised
[15:30] and peter says oh hold on a minute
[15:32] if that were true then why when i
[15:34] preached the word in the house of uh
[15:37] of cornelius they received the word and
[15:39] peter says and the word and he says and
[15:41] the holy ghost fell upon them and they
[15:43] were filled with the holy ghost
[15:46] and it was exactly the same as how me
[15:48] and you how we received it this is what
[15:50] this entire meeting was about
[15:52] and it's amazing because then james
[15:55] speaks up
[15:56] the same writer of this book and now
[15:58] remember he's the half-brother of jesus
[16:02] and he speaks up and and he finds
[16:04] himself and peter paul in galatians
[16:07] references james and calls him the
[16:09] pillar he was the pastor of the first
[16:12] church
[16:13] amazing jesus is brother
[16:17] and and he
[16:19] and james speaks up in any any and he
[16:21] begins to speak we don't have we're
[16:23] going to lose time here we already have
[16:24] i just wanted to take that just for a
[16:26] moment to show you how important of a
[16:29] role this man james
[16:31] served that even in the jerusalem
[16:33] council it was james who really brought
[16:35] them all bro all of the groups together
[16:38] and james begins to tell them to he says
[16:40] what we should do is teach them to
[16:42] abstain from this and so what he's what
[16:44] james is going to do is he's going to
[16:46] teach gentiles how to live amongst jews
[16:49] that's really what it was about
[16:52] but the entire book
[16:54] is about a testing or a trine of what
[16:57] true christianity is because
[16:59] christianity in its purest form is not a
[17:02] church it's not a preacher it's not a
[17:05] belief
[17:06] it's not a prayer
[17:08] it's a life that has lived
[17:11] like
[17:12] christ
[17:13] that is christianity
[17:15] is when you are christ like
[17:19] james covers all of this from the
[17:21] beginning to the end of what it means to
[17:23] have genuine faith genuine christianity
[17:28] and i think it's amazing because when
[17:30] you look at the
[17:31] the value of anything if you're going to
[17:33] measure the intrinsic value of a diamond
[17:35] or the or or of gold or whatever
[17:38] whatever
[17:39] whatever commodity you want to name that
[17:41] would be valuable
[17:43] you would put it through
[17:44] examination
[17:46] you wouldn't just take a jeweler
[17:48] wouldn't just take a
[17:49] uh
[17:50] rubik zirconium is that how you say it
[17:52] cubic thank you
[17:54] shows i i bought a real diamond i didn't
[17:56] buy a fake one i'm just kidding
[17:58] i don't even know what they are i'm just
[18:00] kidding
[18:01] cubic zirconium
[18:03] but a jeweler's not just gonna take a
[18:05] cubic zirconium and say you know here's
[18:08] this you know three or four massive
[18:10] diamond and you give it to him and he
[18:11] just goes oh you know here's here's 10
[18:14] grand for your for for what you brought
[18:16] no he's gonna he's going to take it back
[18:18] there
[18:19] and he's going to look at it halle
[18:21] jeweler would because he's looking for a
[18:24] quality
[18:25] he's looking for something a quality
[18:27] inside of that diamond because it's the
[18:30] quality of the diamond what's inside of
[18:33] it that could only be seen with the
[18:35] magnifying glass
[18:37] that gives the diamond its value
[18:40] did you catch that
[18:42] it's not what you see on the outside
[18:45] it's what god sees on the inside that
[18:47] gives you your value
[18:49] and you may look and see nothing but god
[18:50] looks through a magnifying glass and
[18:52] says i see me
[18:56] and so to measure you take any diamonds
[18:59] money
[19:00] what are they going to do when you give
[19:01] them a you know a hundred dollar bill or
[19:02] like brother diggs says of ben franklin
[19:05] they're gonna they're gonna take it and
[19:07] they're gonna mark it they're gonna make
[19:08] sure that it's that it's genuine
[19:11] they're going to make sure that it's
[19:13] real they're going to test
[19:15] the value they're going to test the
[19:17] authenticity of that whatever it is it's
[19:20] going to be a metal or gold a silver a
[19:23] diamond money they're going to test it
[19:26] to make sure it's what it says or what
[19:30] it portrays
[19:31] that it is and
[19:33] salvation true
[19:35] christian christ-like
[19:37] uh uh uh a
[19:40] life that's really been transformed by
[19:42] the spirit of god
[19:44] is a life that possesses eternal life
[19:49] eternal life is the greatest commodity
[19:51] in the whole world
[19:52] greater than any diamond or any gold or
[19:54] any silver or any money
[19:56] it's it's it doesn't have a value
[19:59] because it's priceless
[20:01] and so james says in order to determine
[20:04] that you've got that genuine article
[20:07] there's got to be a test there's it's
[20:09] got to be put through a process
[20:12] to determine if you have and let me just
[20:14] say this to have the right relationship
[20:17] and not a church relationship and not a
[20:20] denominational relationship but to have
[20:22] a true relationship
[20:24] a relationships that's that is right
[20:27] a true relationship with the lord that
[20:30] is right
[20:31] is one of the most priceless valuable
[20:33] things you could possess
[20:37] when a church not when a church approves
[20:39] you but when the lord approves what
[20:42] you've got
[20:43] [Music]
[20:44] and so
[20:45] james says we're gonna test it we're
[20:47] going to try it we're going to we're
[20:48] going to see if it's we're going to
[20:50] examine it
[20:52] to make sure it's not wrong
[20:54] to make sure it's genuine
[20:58] psalms 173 getting if you can just
[21:00] follow me closely so we don't have to
[21:02] take the time to turn time is burning
[21:04] right now 10 49.

[25:05] ezekiel 18
[25:07] verse 28.
[25:12] he says because he considered because he
[25:14] considereth
[25:16] and turneth away from all his
[25:18] transgression transgression that he hath
[25:20] committed he shall surely live
[25:22] he shall not die why
[25:26] why is he going to live now and not die
[25:29] because he
[25:30] considereth
[25:32] because he tested because he tried
[25:35] because he thought as david says i
[25:37] thought on my ways
[25:39] i thought on my ways so this is a
[25:41] consideration he says and you don't have
[25:44] to turn you can get it haggai verse
[25:46] chapter 1 verse 5. now therefore saith
[25:48] the the lord of her the lord of hosts
[25:52] consider your ways

[25:59] and he says consider your ways thus
[26:01] saith the lord of hosts he says it again
[26:03] and repeats it consider your
[26:06] ways think of your life this is really
[26:09] what he's meaning here
[26:11] and you can go through all i'm just
[26:12] going to take a pause just for a moment
[26:13] you can go through all the gospels and
[26:15] you're looking at the life of jesus you
[26:17] could go through all of acts and look at
[26:19] all of the life of the church
[26:21] and we're natured more than geared more
[26:23] this way to consider and ponder the
[26:26] world around us
[26:28] and not the inside of us
[26:31] introspectively when we come to the book
[26:33] of james james is saying you say you're
[26:36] a christian
[26:37] you say you're christ-like
[26:40] you say you're real believer let's
[26:42] really put it to the test

[26:46] christian one who's really been born of
[26:48] the spirit of god you know what they say
[26:50] yes lord that's right

[27:16] don't like what you see
[27:18] whether you hear a tape you turn on a
[27:20] tape and you're listening to god's
