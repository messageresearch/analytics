[41:54] scripture behold I lay in Zion on a
[41:57] Chief Cornerstone elect precious and he
[42:01] that believeth on him shall not be
[42:05] confounded unto you therefore which

[42:16] disobedient the stone which the builders
[42:19] disallow the same is made the head of
[42:22] the
[42:23] Conor and a stone of stumbling and a
[42:27] rock of offense even to them which
[42:30] tumble at the word being disobedient
[42:34] where unto also they were

[45:37] and can you stand up for the people to
[45:39] know who you are he's a wonderful
[45:41] preacher very Mighty preacher and that
[45:44] Angelo there Angelo yeah God bless you
[45:48] for this sacrifice yeah I appreciate
[45:51] that I really appreciate that we thank
[45:54] God so we are we are here for one
[45:56] purpose to hear the voice of God uh and
[45:59] my subject tonight is peculiar
[46:04] people peculiar
[46:06] people I believe tonight I'm here to
[46:09] address peculiar
[46:12] people now listen I am not an English
[46:16] man like you so I wanted to understand
[46:18] what P peculiar means so when I look at
[46:22] the dictionary he
[46:24] said peculiar he said said
[46:28] characteristics of one
[46:31] person or a thing or
[46:34] group
[46:37] distinctive different from normal right
[46:41] or
[46:43] isua then it comes
[46:46] uniqueness being the one only
[46:50] Soul s o e
[46:53] so then two being without a like or
[46:59] equal
[47:01] unequal I said wow that is
[47:04] unique
[47:06] so
[47:08] every
[47:09] character is assigned to somebody who is
[47:14] peculiar in that manifestation all
[47:17] right so it makes you unique it makes
[47:20] you different from other people because
[47:22] you have your
[47:24] uniqueness yes sir now
[47:27] God the Supreme creator of the universe
[47:31] he is also unique in his
[47:35] characteristics very unique uncomparable
[47:39] nobody could compare his character or
[47:42] his attribute everything we cannot
[47:45] compare it with God
[47:47] no so
[47:51] now God making his
[47:55] choice distinctive
[47:57] his peculiar nature could only be
[48:00] manifest as long as Israel keep his word
[48:04] because he chose
[48:07] Israel all the
[48:10] nations because he wanted to make a
[48:14] perfect Masterpiece we all know the
[48:16] story said when Adam fell God has to
[48:19] quickly make a master
[48:21] pce and that's how he pick Abraham to
[48:25] get a perfect Masterpiece out of
[48:29] Abraham and we see Isaac coming we see
[48:33] that Jacob and the prophet just made us
[48:37] to understand Grace that is love he he
[48:41] explained everything to us God building
[48:44] another Masterpiece and he made a
[48:47] covenant with Abraham that he will never
[48:51] that is fail Abraham God is not a
[48:54] covenant breaker right
[48:57] when he makes a covenant he keeps his
[49:01] Covenant so he told Abraham that I've
[49:05] chosen you and your
[49:07] people will be peculiar they will be
[49:10] Above All Nations all all tongs all
[49:13] kindr they will be completely
[49:17] different now listen in
[49:20] Exodus Exodus Exodus 193 and Moses went
[49:24] up unto God and the Lord called
[49:27] him out of the mountain saying th shall
[49:32] thou say to the house of Jacob and tell
[49:35] the children of Israel ye have seen what
[49:39] I did unto the Egyptians and how I bear
[49:43] you on Eagle wings and brought you unto
[49:49] myself now therefore if you will obey my
[49:53] voice indeed there's condition here if
[49:57] you obey my voice
[49:59] indeed and keep my
[50:02] Covenant then you shall be a peculiar
[50:06] treasure unto me above all people for
[50:10] all the Earth is mine and ye shall be
[50:15] unto me a kingdom of priests and a holy
[50:19] nation these are the words which thou
[50:22] shall speak unto the children of
[50:25] Israel sir
[50:27] God is looking for people that he can
[50:30] really transfer his pecularity to all
[50:34] right he's looking for people that when
[50:36] you see those people you will see god
[50:41] wow so now he's speaking to Moses Moses
[50:45] this is what I have that I've thought of
[50:49] and I want to do to Abraham seed so that
[50:54] they will just reflect my image wow so
[50:58] tell them the only condition is that
[51:01] they must keep my word
[51:04] wowu
[51:08] hallelu he said if thou has chosen and
[51:12] affirmed the Lord as thy God and to walk
[51:16] in his ways and to keep his Commandment
[51:19] that is the only way to keep the
[51:23] peculiarity of God now in Deuteronomy it
[51:26] says God is also re reaffirming because
[51:29] it is something that is very very
[51:32] important so God continue to affirm this
[51:37] word to Israel Deuteronomy 26:16 let us
[51:42] go this day the Lord thy God had
[51:46] commanded thee to do this States and
[51:51] judgment thou shall therefore keep and
[51:54] do them with all that heart and with all
[51:58] thy
[51:59] Soul there has a watch is that the
[52:01] correct
[52:03] pronunciation a o u c h
[52:06] i th a the Lord this day to be thy
[52:12] God and to walk in his ways and to keep
[52:17] his
[52:18] statutes and his commandment and his
[52:21] judgment and to hecken onto his voice
[52:25] and the Lord have have AED the this day
[52:29] to be his peculiar
[52:32] people as he had promise thee and thou
[52:37] shall thou should keep all his
[52:40] commandment all right and to make the
[52:44] High Above All Nations which he have
[52:47] made in praise and in name and in
[52:53] honor and that th mayest be the holy
[52:57] people unto the Lord thy God as he has
[53:02] spoken I thought I was looking for that
[53:05] meaning it means he said to declare as a
[53:10] matter of a fact for a that can be
[53:15] proven to
[53:17] affir so he said Israel has a voice they
[53:21] have affirmed that God is their God they
[53:25] have made a choice
[53:27] they've hen to the voice of God that if
[53:31] you we are your people you are our God
[53:35] they have confirmed
[53:36] that and God also confirm with them that
[53:40] you are my God if you have recognize if
[53:43] you have realized that I am your God I
[53:46] am also your god wow
[53:50] Hallelujah so he went further to affirm
[53:53] his promise that you will be a peculiar
[53:59] Nation a spiritual priesthood to offer
[54:05] Praises God has his purpose of creating
[54:08] us friends he created us to praise him
[54:11] you are here to praise
[54:14] God that is why we are on this
[54:18] Earth said Angels were praising holy
[54:21] holy holy but God was not satisfied all
[54:24] right he wanted to get his
[54:26] own image wow wow praising him
[54:30] worshiping him falling at his feet then
[54:34] he will become a king and then he he
[54:36] will know his said yeah look at my
[54:39] people praising
[54:40] me that is why we are here
[54:44] tonight now
[54:47] listen the Lord did not choose isra
[54:51] because they are few or because they are
[54:53] many but he loved them in Deuteronomy
[54:55] chapter 7 verse 6 he said for thou art
[55:00] an holy people he is affirming it again
[55:03] to Israel you are a holy people unto the
[55:06] Lord thy God the Lord thy God has have
[55:11] chosen thee to be a Especial people unto
[55:15] himself yeah above all people that are
[55:18] upon the face of the Earth the Lord did
[55:22] not set his love upon you nor choose you
[55:25] because ye are are more in number than
[55:28] any people for ye are the
[55:31] fewest of all people but because the
[55:35] Lord love you you see the condition it's
[55:38] love it is not because is like there
[55:40] were few or there were many it is the
[55:42] love of
[55:44] God God loves you and because he will
[55:48] keep the oath which he has sworn unto
[55:51] your fathers he can never deny his off
[55:55] he has made a ofto your
[55:57] fathers have the Lord brought you out
[56:01] with a mighty hand and redeem you out of
[56:04] the house of bond men from the hand of
[56:07] pharaoh king of Egypt know therefore
[56:11] that the Lord thy God he is God the
[56:14] faithful God who keep Covenant and mercy
[56:18] with them that love him and keep his
[56:20] commandment to a thousand
[56:23] Generations God speaking to Israel
[56:28] he want Israel to keep his pecularity so
[56:31] the people know that Israel is a nation
[56:35] for
[56:40] God the prophet
[56:43] said said when I stand behind the poit
[56:46] to
[56:47] preach he said I don't want to see you
[56:50] in
[56:53] flesh now in the message there is
[56:56] resurrection of Lazarus if they can put
[56:58] it for you this is 51 tape number
[57:01] 0729 0729 51 paragraph 36 now notice
[57:07] then that is where we are that is what
[57:11] is the matter with the Pentecostal
[57:13] people now it is it is my lot this
[57:18] afternoon to preach and I have a right
[57:21] here at the platform and I don't even
[57:25] want to know any person from the flesh
[57:29] when I stand I am standing here we are
[57:33] not supposed to see you in
[57:35] flesh Pastor Jesse will not stand here
[57:38] and see flesh we have to stand here and
[57:40] see Holy Ghost F Sons and Daughters of
[57:43] God
[57:45] hallelujah we are born again Hallelujah
[57:48] I am not here to look at this flesh that
[57:50] is why we are one we are not one you are
[57:52] white man black man but we are one in
[57:54] spirit the Holy Ghost In You the same
[57:56] Holy Ghost is in me
[58:00] Hallelujah you don't we are not here to
[58:02] see flesh you're here to see the Holy
[58:08] Ghost so he said that is what a matter
[58:12] with the Pentecostal people they don't
[58:14] recognize whom they are I don't
[58:17] think we are in that category we know
[58:21] whom we are Pentecost don't recognize
[58:23] their place but we will know our place
[58:26] place if you don't know your place then
[58:29] you have to come to the
[58:35] altar the prophet says something
[58:40] here who is this
[58:43] MEC
[58:46] 65 number 0221 paragraph 117 being
[58:50] Eternal with him at the
[58:53] beginning the eternal life that you had
[58:57] his thought of what you was only he

[59:41] people to say that we don't need a
[59:43] pastor he
[59:47] said he
[59:49] said now
[59:54] listen where should we not see one

[1:05:50] world separate yourself and let your
[1:05:53] pecularity hold and then you keep
[1:05:56] reflecting my image to all the world so
[1:05:59] the people don't know that you have a
[1:06:02] special God a different God from their
[1:06:06] gods but

[1:06:53] evil have he done
[1:06:56] but they cried out the more saying let
[1:06:58] him be
[1:06:59] crucified when P saw that he could not
[1:07:03] Prevail nothing but that rather a t a
[1:07:08] tumult was made he took water and washed
[1:07:13] his hand before the multitude saying I
[1:07:15] am innocent of the blood of this just
[1:07:18] person you see see ye to it then
[1:07:23] answered all the people and said his
[1:07:25] blood be on us and on our
[1:07:29] children you see what Israel is going
[1:07:31] through
[1:07:33] now they call for it yes
[1:07:36] sir they rejected their
[1:07:39] King they rejected their
[1:07:42] visitation if you're not careful we also
[1:07:44] going to refuse our
[1:07:47] visitation God has visit visited also in
[1:07:51] flesh our Prophet Willam and Abram if
[1:07:54] you are not careful we also just for fit
[1:07:57] that we will lose our
[1:08:00] visitation Israel they rejected their
[1:08:03] visitation and they called the blood of
[1:08:05] Jesus to come upon that that is what is
[1:08:07] going on
[1:08:09] today but
[1:08:11] friends Israel
[1:08:14] cannot they cannot do any other thing
[1:08:17] until the bread has gone out I always
[1:08:20] say BR J we are really we are we we are
[1:08:23] putting more woes to Isel because we are
[1:08:26] not ready to go if you leave this earth
[1:08:28] God will attend to Israel yes
[1:08:32] sir he will come and reveal himself to
[1:08:35] them now the Revelation is with the
[1:08:37] Gentiles we have seen the revelation of
[1:08:40] Christ because we The Chosen then we
[1:08:42] will come to
[1:08:44] that but why do we hinder Israel brother
[1:08:47] let us get ourselves ready to go let us
[1:08:50] go
[1:08:52] home I have another message I didn't
[1:08:54] know how what God wanted me to we are
[1:08:57] strangers and pilgrims I have a Mery on
[1:09:01] that now
[1:09:05] listen second Peter the we read I mean
[1:09:08] First Peter chapter 2 he said now why is
[1:09:11] Peter speaking this God spoke to Israel
[1:09:15] that you Israel you are peculiar people
[1:09:17] a chosen generation but Peter no he's
[1:09:21] not addressing is right Peter is
[1:09:23] addressing the Saints yeah
[1:09:26] which means the blessing that belongs to
[1:09:28] Israel like Jacob is it Jacob who cross
[1:09:31] his son Jacob when he cross then it mean
[1:09:35] the blessing has to come to the Gentiles
[1:09:37] at the
[1:09:38] cross you see it so now Peter is saying
[1:09:42] First Peter chapter
[1:09:44] 2:9 but ye are a chosen generation a
[1:09:48] royal priesthood and holy A peculiar
[1:09:52] people that you should show forth the
[1:09:55] cises of him who have called you out of
[1:09:58] Darkness into His Marvelous
[1:10:01] Light which in time pass we not the
[1:10:05] people but I not the people of God which
[1:10:09] had not obtained Mercy but now has
[1:10:11] obtain Mercy why should this blessing
[1:10:13] come to us because Israel rejected God
[1:10:17] but God is still Bend to get Peculiar
[1:10:21] people all right yes
[1:10:23] sir he said want to have peculiar people
[1:10:27] who will reflect his
[1:10:29] image because it was sin that deny us
[1:10:33] from that
[1:10:35] manifestation but thank God sin has been
[1:10:39] abolished Behold the Lamb of God that
[1:10:41] taken away the sins of the
[1:10:46] world where should Li allow sin to
[1:10:50] surprise me again where whereas the
[1:10:52] sacrifice already be made amen before I
[1:10:56] could sin it the lamb was slain in the
[1:10:58] thought of
[1:11:04] God
[1:11:06] listen Romans 12:1 I be you therefore
[1:11:10] breing by the mercies of God that you
[1:11:13] present your bodies a Living Sacrifice
[1:11:16] holy acceptable unto God which is your
[1:11:19] reasonable
[1:11:21] service and be not conformed to this
[1:11:24] world
[1:11:25] but be transformed by the renewing of
[1:11:28] your mind that ye may prove that which
[1:11:32] is good and acceptable and perfect will
[1:11:36] of
[1:11:37] God you see it God is looking for people
[1:11:41] that will really manifest his
[1:11:45] glory that is why Paul say you are an EP
[1:11:47] written Hallelujah yes sir in
[1:11:51] identification say people will not buy
[1:11:53] the Bible again but when you walk on the
[1:11:55] Street a Bible a Bible
[1:11:58] today my friend if you not buy a Bible
[1:12:00] you read
[1:12:03] me
[1:12:05] Hallelujah
[1:12:07] Bible you
[1:12:10] understand
[1:12:13] now Paul was telling us to be very very
[1:12:18] that is we have to be warned the
[1:12:20] Gentiles because Israel has rejected God
[1:12:24] if you are not therefore we can also do
[1:12:26] the
[1:12:27] same so Romans 11:2 Paul said where
[1:12:30] because of unbelief they were breaken
[1:12:32] off and thou standed by faith be not be
[1:12:35] highminded by fear Romans
[1:12:39] 11:20 if you are not careful we also
[1:12:41] going to lose this
[1:12:44] Grace he has broken Israel off and
[1:12:48] brought us wild o he has really got us
[1:12:52] in because Israel
[1:12:56] refuse God but still God want his
[1:12:59] pecularity to be seen he want to express
[1:13:03] his
[1:13:04] glory hallu hallu so therefore he has to
[1:13:08] look for a gentle
[1:13:12] bride so the in the book of Hebrew he
[1:13:17] said but Hebrews chapter 3 ver 17 say
[1:13:20] but with them with whom was he grieve 40
[1:13:24] years it it was it not with them that
[1:13:28] has sinned whose carcasses fell in the
[1:13:31] wilderness and to whom swear he that
[1:13:35] they should not enter into his
[1:13:37] rest but to them that believe it was to
[1:13:40] them they believe not so you see they
[1:13:44] could not enter in because of
[1:13:47] unbelief that is
[1:13:50] Israel but you are privileged tonight

[1:15:13] talking about four seal 63 tape number
[1:15:17] 0312 no 0321

[1:15:23] religious man
[1:15:25] he didn't claim to be an unbeliever he
[1:15:29] believed in the same God Jacob did Same
[1:15:32] God his daddy did but he was just a
[1:15:37] shter or excuse me that expression he
[1:15:39] said said now as far as being
[1:15:44] moral he was better more acting man than
[1:15:49] Jacob was but you see he didn't oh
[1:15:53] what's the best right got to do with
[1:15:57] it and he sold his birth right to Jacob

[1:16:04] things like just like Esau did he didn't
[1:16:08] have the inheritance it was not for him
[1:16:11] as it was for Esau but there was one
[1:16:14] thing Jacob
[1:16:16] wanted was the be FR he didn't care how
[1:16:20] he had to get it he was going to get it
[1:16:24] and God had
[1:16:28] respect I don't care receive the Holy

[1:53:19] jesusall Paul
[1:53:22] he
[1:53:24] recognized when he saw the pillar of
[1:53:27] fire and then he struck him and God
[1:53:30] wanted
[1:53:31] to position Paul as a true witness yes
[1:53:36] sir brother he was not with them in the
[1:53:38] upper room so when we are talking of
[1:53:41] witnesses Paul was not one of them the
[1:53:44] witnesses they came from The Upper Room
[1:53:46] 120 Witnesses and said before God can
[1:53:50] put you as a witness God has to train

[1:53:58] his nature in you and put his pecul his
[1:54:02] his character in

[1:54:10] you Paul when he was arrested God placed
[1:54:14] in him his his nature and he was changed
[1:54:17] his intellectual fault everything
[1:54:20] changed and he told his friends the phes
[1:54:24] I cannot be disobedient let me tell you
[1:54:26] I was also thinking that righteousness
[1:54:29] is in the law but I want to tell you I
[1:54:32] count everything as
[1:54:34] done to win Christ that is why you have
[1:54:38] also forsaken everything yes sir
[1:54:41] otherwise you could have also compet
[1:54:42] with the world but you you cannot
[1:54:45] compete with them because you have a
[1:54:48] good
[1:54:49] report the Holy Ghost is always constant
[1:54:52] periodically sending report to your

[1:55:40] my friend he's gone I asked even of oh
[1:55:45] no she is also
[1:55:47] gone
[1:55:49] brother you see this this home this one

[1:55:55] place that is why you should not allow
[1:55:57] this one to deceive you my
[1:56:01] friend if you stick to this one you will
[1:56:04] be deceived and then you will be your
[1:56:06] name will be written on the earth like
[1:56:07] Jeremiah said some people their name are
[1:56:09] written on the
[1:56:12] Earth but you you have your name written
[1:56:14] in the books of life God's L book of
[1:56:17] life therefore look at how this world is
[1:56:22] terminating everything is going to an
[1:56:25] end you
[1:56:27] understand but it looked at people don't
[1:56:31] want to see to all the events the
[1:56:34] Realties friends we don't have time

[1:56:44] old ladies look at me old man look at my
[1:56:49] face I'm
[1:56:51] going you understand isn't a good
[1:56:56] place therefore you should not allow

[1:57:03] God praising God regardless of this one
[1:57:07] let this one not be a hindrance praise
[1:57:10] God worship him let his nature
[1:57:14] be exploded let the people see Christ
[1:57:19] Hallelujah let them see Jesus yes
[1:57:23] sir because the prophet said that is God
[1:57:27] what he said what we want to do we have
[1:57:29] to do today is to let the people get
[1:57:31] life life there are people somewhere you
[1:57:35] go near them you you they will poison
[1:57:38] you you die because when they speak it
[1:57:41] is
[1:57:43] death but some people when they speak
[1:57:45] it's life yes
[1:57:47] sir you see
[1:57:49] it so we must really carry this message
[1:57:52] to the dying Nation the dying generation
[1:57:55] said the people are dying we must carry
[1:57:57] the message to them that is what you are
[1:57:59] doing I know you are sending
[1:58:00] missionaries sending money to Russia my
[1:58:03] brother has been telling me a lot about
[1:58:05] you what you are doing here in this
[1:58:07] church God bless you for that if when
[1:58:11] soul is one it is at your
[1:58:15] advantage don't be worried when you're
[1:58:17] doing good
[1:58:19] things you understand
[1:58:22] because there is a dying generation when
[1:58:27] he gave him the staff said take my staff
[1:58:29] run go and put it on the dead there is a
[1:58:32] dead boy in my room go and put the stuff
[1:58:34] on him don't wait for any man don't
[1:58:37] greet any man you are carrying a message
[1:58:40] to the dead so don't waste time this is
[1:58:43] what we have to do we are carrying a
[1:58:45] message to the
[1:58:47] dead you should not wait up the world is
[1:58:50] really hungry the world is sinking but
[1:58:53] let the bread prove to this world that
[1:58:56] there is hope Hallelujah in Jesus
[1:59:01] Christ you
[1:59:04] understand the people are perishing but
[1:59:07] we must get the life in the message path
[1:59:09] of Life the path of Life 62
[1:59:13] 0621 0621 path of Life parag 102 Jesus
[1:59:19] said I come that they might have life zo
[1:59:24] God's own life in them and that's
[1:59:27] everything that had a beginning has an
[1:59:29] end it is those things which had no
[1:59:32] beginning has no end that's right can
[1:59:35] you tell me you are beginning you you
[1:59:36] have no
[1:59:38] beginning you don't have
[1:59:41] beginning because that eternal life in
[1:59:43] you did not
[1:59:46] begin so you don't have an end that is
[1:59:49] my consolation that's my comfort and
[1:59:52] know who is sitting in me who is living
[1:59:54] in me who is who has taken resident in
[1:59:57] my soul I know
[1:59:59] him and therefore I'm
[2:00:02] convinced that I came from God I will go
[2:00:05] back to
[2:00:08] God
[2:00:10] hallelujah you must know where you come
[2:00:13] from now I've come here maybe
[2:00:16] about 60 days Mission work I'll go back
[2:00:20] to Africa I came from Africa I'll will
[2:00:22] go back to Africa I'm not an
[2:00:25] American We Came From Heaven we must go
[2:00:28] back to
[2:00:30] heaven the reason we have to go to
[2:00:32] heaven is this world is
[2:00:34] contaminated God gave us this
[2:00:36] inheritance he gave this AB in adoption
[2:00:39] he gave this land to Adam this is Adam's
[2:00:43] inheritance but why why do we call
[2:00:46] ourselves strangers from our own land
[2:00:48] why are we strangers on our own land
[2:00:51] because it has been contaminated this is
[2:00:53] not the place to live it is Satan hi in
[2:00:57] so I call myself a stranger from my own
[2:01:00] land because this is Str things that we
[2:01:02] are seeing on this Earth yes but God is
[2:01:04] going to wipe away all this foolishness
[2:01:07] and all this sin all these outs
[2:01:09] everything will wipe away and then you
[2:01:13] re they be regenerate renovation he will
[2:01:18] do renovation of this Earth and then we
[2:01:20] will come to a in our original
[2:01:26] Place see your pecularity brother you
[2:01:29] are peculiar why because said God
[2:01:33] divided himself in the Mage conference
[2:01:35] he divided himself that you get a
[2:01:37] portion of God I get a portion of God
[2:01:39] you get a portion so when we come
[2:01:41] together what are we going to that we
[2:01:43] are going to form the pillar of fire
[2:01:47] again that's what is going on so when we
[2:01:50] come to God we are forming Pillar of
[2:01:52] Fire
[2:01:53] again how can you say that you don't
[2:01:56] need me it is word upon word when the
[2:01:59] brick layer when they block brick layer
[2:02:01] is laying block block upon block block

[2:18:27] live the
[2:18:30] way he wants
[2:18:38] me

[2:18:43] no to him I want to
[2:18:49] love love
[2:18:52] children just no more love for I could
[2:18:59] never
[2:19:05] ever I've asked brother Kenny to try
[2:19:09] that song again that we were singing
[2:19:11] right before we turned it over it's very
[2:19:12] lovely but with end the words so I hope
[2:19:14] we have the words for that now you know
[2:19:17] I i' never never heard it said quite
[2:19:20] like that
[2:19:21] that God is looking for a people that he
[2:19:25] can transfer his peculiarity into oh wow
[2:19:30] what a way to say it that God is
[2:19:33] peculiar and you know I was looking as
[2:19:36] brother Thomas was breaking that word
[2:19:38] down I was following along he was
[2:19:40] breaking the English word down I was
[2:19:42] breaking down the Greek word and it was
[2:19:45] it was quite um quite convoluted I was
[2:19:49] surprised by it cuz I I thought it was
[2:19:51] pretty
[2:19:52] straightforward but it it it's it's kind
[2:19:55] of like an an action it's almost like
[2:19:58] it's called you to something or it's
[2:20:00] called you out from something into
[2:20:02] something it's all about motion and it
[2:20:05] is that it's necessary because it's the
[2:20:09] activity is why you get identified as
[2:20:12] peculiar and to my surprise the same
[2:20:17] word is is used brother Aubrey in a
[2:20:22] devil possessed person because they
[2:20:25] you'd say wow they act weird they act
[2:20:27] pear wow that person got a spirit but
[2:20:30] everybody acts peculiar by one Spirit or
[2:20:32] the other you're either filled with the
[2:20:35] spirit of the of the devil or you're
[2:20:36] filled with the spirit of God and
[2:20:37] they're peculiar to each other they
[2:20:40] don't act like you you don't act like
[2:20:41] them at least you're not supposed to if
[2:20:43] you have the spirit of God but you are
[2:20:46] very peculiar to the world and I thought
[2:20:50] wow W I've never I never have caught
[2:20:53] that part of it as brother Thomas was
[2:20:55] saying so we don't come to
[2:20:58] church to see the flesh we come to see
[2:21:03] the Holy Ghost in each other and I
[2:21:06] thought how fitting that is because you
[2:21:09] being in your flesh don't do me a whole
[2:21:10] lot of good I can see you at
[2:21:13] Walmart but to come into the house of
[2:21:16] God and come together and bring all
[2:21:17] these little licks of fire he went the
[2:21:20] list I must have I must have list five
[2:21:22] or six brand new reasons why we should
[2:21:25] assemble and be at church amen oh
[2:21:28] hallelujah amen praise the Lord let's
