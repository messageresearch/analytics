TRANSCRIPT
========================================
god bless you let's all stand to our feet this morning amen matthew chapter 20 and if you have your bible we'll turn there amen matthew 28. i'd like to begin a series here teaching for our sunday school and uh the lord just has just placed this upon my heart and i would like to just title this very simply the church it's our title today is the church matthew 28 we'll begin reading at verse 18. and jesus came and spake unto them saying all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth go ye therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost teaching them to observe all things whatsoever i have commanded you and lo i am with you always even unto the end of the world amen may you be seated you can be seated this morning may the lord have his blessing amen to the word this morning we'd like to just begin a series here on the church and in this series i'd like to cover what is the church and it's amazing so many times when you understand you take people's definition of what the church is and what we even would reflect today and say what we believe what is church when we ask that question we could also ask the same question why a church uh why not a temple why not a mosque why not a you know a um a uh you know what commune what whatever different times of types of types or forms that religion has produced for a place a gathering a meeting place so why do we gather in a church what is the church and what is the purpose i think is probably the most important question we could ask is what is the purpose of the church why what is the purpose of coming to church these are all things we like to just look at because i believe that we have a real good answer i believe that the word teaches is a teacher and and there's so much uh that we could learn from it so we'd just like to begin that today we read matthew 28 uh in very popular scripture here in verse 19 when jesus commands and commissions the church now in matthew 28 the church hadn't even been born yet but this is the commission from jesus because we know that the the beginning the birth the alpha the origin and the the original the genesis the seed the beginning in the beginning of the church was in the book of acts and brother branham tells us that that it was there was an peter preached the inaugurational message and his inaugurational message was to repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ and you shall receive the gift of the holy spirit you could read the book of acts to follow along with that to see what the first church that's why we call it that the first church let's cover just some uh some details here because many oftentimes we call church um a building and we think of it that way we know it's not none of us all of us here as believers know that the church isn't the building but yet we all still refer to i'm going to church and so i'm going to what do we mean when we say i'm going to church well i'm going to a place on 2608 mossy oak road or wherever that is for you and so um for those of you streaming today but we what do we mean when we say it it's obviously it's not a building the word church that we find in the bible is a translation of the greek word ecclesia and it it simply means an assembling or a gathering or an assembly of people that's where we get the word assembly we call it this is our local assembly it's our local gathering our local church it's also that greek word ecclesia also means the called out ones and that's cliche in a lot of in a lot of ways but think about that just for a moment think about that title that when jesus established a church and called us to a church we are the called out so we are we've been called out of something and now we're something what are we what have we been called out of the world we've been called out of sin and jesus has called each one of us out not as a group but as an individual he's called us out of our sins and then we make up the gathering the assembly the ecclesia and so the the the word there doesn't at all mean building but it's a it's a it rather speaks of people and lives and souls and so romans 16 uh verse five you don't have to turn it's amazing because it speaks of the church actually it says greet the church that is in the home that is in the house and so the bible refers to a church in a house now you got to be careful when you say that because you know we have groups that that think it's that all we do is the the entire body in the ministry of the church is just to gather in homes and play tapes and you know good godly sincere people but um sincerely wrong and you say how are they wrong about brother matt because that's not what the word teaches we're going to learn that the word teaches that the church has a purpose and we don't try to redefine that purpose we don't try to remake it up as we go along and just decide you know we're going to become more modern that's what the modern church has done what the what you have today in the modern church is so distant from what the first original intent and purpose that jesus had when he established the first church so there's a pattern and brother branham said that he said there's a pattern and he said and that pattern must always remain true we never try to change that pattern and he said that pattern was the first church in the book of acts on the day of pentecost not the denomination of pentecost on the day of pentecost that feast that where the church was born that is the pattern brother branham says it's so emphatically in the church age book he says there is no other pattern so what do we pattern ourselves after the word which was the first church can you say amen and so it's not a it's not a a building but it's a he says that let me go back to romans 16 but it's a group uh and he even greets them in their house so it's meaning that it's a group of people it's a body of believers uh it's the body of christ i want you to turn to ephesians chapter one if you have your bible just turn there with me in your in your bible ephesians chapter one i had some quotes from the prophet ready and i just didn't uh i don't know that we'll get to them today uh to to just the the line of the foundation that we're laying here we may not get to show you those that i'll probably read some from up here but not ones that i have ephesians chapter 1 and i just want to begin reading at verse 22. and hath put let's begin at verse 20 just for context which he wrought in christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places far above all principality and power and might and dominion and every name that is named not only in this world but also in that which is to come and hath put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church so he is the head who are we talking about who's the he christ and he says gave him to be the head over all things to the church which is his body amen which is his body not now now we're not just talking about a body of believers like a body of land or a body as a group we're not just talking about a a segregated group but now he goes further and says in fact that group that that segregated group that that called out separated i should say separated group is not just a body but it's his body the fullness of him that filleth all in all which is his christ body so we are the body of christ and he says which is his body the fullness of him that filleth all in all so that body we have a body here today and he's using that figuratively of our own body that here we are today and we all all of us have a head today or else you would be dead all of you have a head but figuratively he's speaking of something that that head controls the rest of the body in that head is the intelligence remember brother i'm talking about that in the head is the intelligence it tells the body what to do but yet on the opposite side of that i have no hands but your hands i have no feet but your feet so without the body the head can do nothing and without the head the body could do nothing so who is what is the headship it's not a man what is the headship of the church it's not a man and and men have been placed there erroneously it's not a man we have a pastor we believe in a pastor we believe in god using that the elder of the church but the head of the body is christ it's not a bishop it's not a pope it's not a prophet not a man it's not the headship of the world the headship of the word was not a prophet was not a man was not a teaching or a doctrine it was christ we mean that in the most in the most literal way we possibly can say it it is christ amen who is the head let's go on just a little bit further and he says god placed all things under his feet and appointed him to be the head over everything for the church so here he is referring to the church again and so the body's made up of believers in jesus christ and it starts on the on the in acts chapter 2. i want you to read there in acts chapter 2 and let's just begin reading in acts 2 and we'll just begin reading in verse 1. acts 2 verse 1. i know they already have it but i just want you to to get it there i hear pages turning and that's wonderful amen i i can tell you that there's something very special about reading the pages of your bible it's good to have it on the screen but take take my word for it open your bible at home and you're in your off time and read the literal it's good to have audio i love we're living in the day of technology i'll just insert this here we're living in the day of technology where you could just have audio bible and you could hear the bible and you put it in your airpods or whatever you decide to use you put it there and you listen to that but that's good it's good to hear the word but there's something special about reading the word something special about when the word is read and you read it for yourself and you comprehend it the lord can i just believe uses that in a special way and when the day of pentecost was fully come they were all with one accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as a rushing mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as a fire and it sat upon each of them and they were all filled with the holy ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance so verse 4 is a transition it's a beginning it's a new dispensation this hadn't ever this isn't an event that you're reading that was repeated it was the second time it wasn't that this was the first time this is what jesus spoke of in john i think chapter 7 when he says he that believeth on me shall out of his belly flow rivers of living water and he says and then in your parentheses there in your king james bible it says for he spoke of the spirit that had not yet been given that's exactly what it says there so it was all prophetic it was all moving towards something john was filled with the spirit from his mother's womb meaning on his flesh there was a purpose upon his life as the same way that shamgar was filled with the spirit on his flesh there was a purpose samson had it but the spirit in this way that you're reading in verse 4 had never happened yet because the spirit as jesus said had not yet been given but now now the new the the dispensation begins let's read it here again and they were all filled with the holy ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance and there were dwelling in jerusalem jews development and every out of every nation under heaven now when this was noise abroad the multitude came together when conf were confounded because that every man heard them speak in his own language and they were all amazed and marveled saying one to another behold are not all these which speak galileans and how here we every man in our own tongue which wherein we were born and he goes to lis list those countries all the way down through verse 11. and they were all verse 12 i'm amazed and we're in doubt saying one to another what meanest this in other words what's happening what's going on what's taking place we've never heard this before others mocking say these men are full of new wine but peter standing up with the eleven lifted up his voice and said unto them you men of judea and all that dwell at jerusalem be this known unto you and hearken to my words for these are not drunken as you suppose see and it is but the third hour of the day but this is that which was spoken by the prophet joel and it shall come to pass and he quotes joel and it shall come to pass so now he's identifying there's a prophecy there's a scripture and this is that this is that fulfillment the same way when jesus the bible says he handed the the scroll back to the priests and said this day this scripture is fulfilled and he points to a prophecy and he says now it's came to pass right here before your very eyes and now here's peter standing up saying this is that this is what was prophesied and let's look at what he quotes here he's quoting joel in verse 17 and it shall come to pass in the last days saith god i will pour out my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams what's he speaking of there he's saying what is that prophecy about your young men will see visions because they've never seen anything like this before it's something god's going to do and your old men will dream dreams in other words they'll look back and say hey this is what was coming this is what was prophesied and here it is right now before us and he says and your young men shall see vision your old men shall dream dreams uh uh where am i at verse 18 and on my servants and all my handmaidens i will pour out in those days of my spirit and they shall prophesy and i shall show wonders in heaven above and signs in the earth beneath blood and fire and vapor and smoke sun shall be turned so it's a it's a fulfillment it's a fulfillment of prophecy now look what peter very familiar uh scripture here he says here in verse 38. verse let's actually start at verse 37. now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto peter and to the rest of the apostles men and brethren what shall we do that word there is amazing when you when you look at that word when it says they were pricked in their heart it doesn't just mean it doesn't just mean that they were curious it really doesn't it's not at all what it's saying it's not saying they went you know it's pretty good peter you know tell us a little bit more but actually that word pricked is this is the way that they give an adrenaline shot to the heart it's stabbed pretty amazing when you think about that you go click on that greek word it's stabbed in the heart that's that's how that's how graphic he's trying to tell you that this is what the preaching of the word of god is supposed to do to the to people it's supposed to not just tickle their ears or tickle their intellect but it stabs them in the heart it pricks them in the heart they're conflicted by it and they say what shall we do then peter said unto them and this is this is what brother branham says is the inauguration it's the banner it's the first sermon he says then peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for the promises unto you and to your children and to all that are afar off even as as many as the lord our god shall call and with many other words he testified and exhorted now here's the first church here's the first sermon and here's the inaugurational day many things throughout the book of acts you'll read all about that church and the exploits and the things that god did and then you pick that up into paul's letters as churches are starting to become established and so that was the first uh church let me just find my notes here and so that was that was the commission where am i at that was the commission to the church and so so what is the purpose i just want to get to some of this here today what is the mission i wish so bad i had this up before on the screen and i don't i'll have it for next time lord willing the prophet of god in 1954 looking for jesus he says there is the mission of the church there is the mission so the church has a mission it's not just a just a a body just just to be a body but it has a mission has a purpose he says there there is the mission of the church is to preach the gospel to demonstrate the power he says oh we've passed tracks everywhere but that ain't what it takes it takes the power and demonstration of the holy spirit truly now you can go so far over to one to one side where you say oh we that means we just need to look for an emotional experience and it's all about you know tongues and it's all about great miracles and what is the gospel it's just all about this great fan fantastic really that's one way that charismatics went so they went to seed on that there's a truth and a real experience and a real physical experience you could have with the holy spirit i've had it multiple times in my life it's wonderful but what is the prophet of god really saying he's saying that that that word that we have that we read that's on paper what is the true mission of the church to demonstrate the life of jesus in a body to the world that's the real mission of the church it's not about demonstrating tongues or some external gift or some gift of the spirit but it's about a church that's christ-like that demonstrates jesus christ in their life to the rest of the world i just say lord that's my i want that more than anything in the whole world i want to i want to have the power of the holy spirit that it can demonstrate you lord in my life to people what is the mission of the church we're running out of time here today we might just stop just for a minute but i just want to give you some of these in colossians 3 we're just going to go through some of these so keep your bible quickly if you could colossians 3 16. what is the mission is the purpose of the church let's find out some of these colossians 3 16 let the word of christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing with grace in your hearts to the lord that's one of the purposes of one of the purposes of why we sing in church why we have music and musicians and instruments up here colossians 3 16 teaching a muslim in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing with grace in your heart to the lord matthew 28 19 we already read we'll skip it first peter 2 verse 9 first peter 2 verse 9. but you i'm gonna wait just for a minute get it find it if you can first peter chapter 2. verse 9 but you are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation a peculiar people that you should show forth the praises of him who has called you out of darkness into his marvelous light ephesians 2 verse 19 this is all covering just the mission of the church what are we to be as believers ephesians 2 verse 19 now therefore you are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens with the saints and of the household of god uh rather than turning i'm just going to go through because i got a bunch of them when the time is closing here first thessalonians 5 just look this way and listen first thessalonians 5 verse 11 if they throw if they have it quick enough good this is the mission of the church the purpose of the church the purpose of the body there wherefore comfort yourselves together and edify one another even as also you do therefore comfort one another first thessalonians 5 11. what are we to be doing as believers there's a part of there's a mission there's a purpose comfort yourselves one another one yourselves together and edify one another to build each other up that's your that's a part of the purpose of god of why you're in a church it's not just to be built up but to build others up right to build each other up uh hebrews 10 verse 25 i want you to make sure you get this one because it's just it's highlighted in neon to me right now hebrews 10 verse 25 this is the purpose of the church the mission not forsaking the assembling of ourselves how are we a church when the word church comes from ecclesia and ecclesia means assembly and gathering how are we the church any longer sitting at home streaming we're not how are we the church if we're not fulfilling what the church's purpose was don't forsake the assembling of ourselves together as as is the manner of some but rather instead of that he says instead of that gather meet gather and exhort one another so much more and so much more as you see the day approaching first peter 2 5 2 verse 4 to whom coming as unto a living stone disallowed in need of men but chosen of god and precious uh and i didn't that was an incorrect there james 5 14 is any sick among you this is the purpose of the church is any sick among you let him call for the elders of the church and let them pray over him anointing him with oil in the name of the lord that's purpose one of the purposes of church is to pray for the sick to lay our hands upon them with faith and pray the prayer of faith matthew 16 jesus says in verse 18 and i say also unto thee that thou art peter and upon this rock i will build my church the ecclesia the assembling the the called out ones and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it last one in acts chapter 2 verse 42 and they continued steadfastly this is that first church we read about and they continued steadfastly in the apostles doctrine and fellowship and in breaking of bread and in prayers we could just teach an entire sunday school on that verse right there they continued in the apostles doctrine and teaching and doctrine and understanding and and grouped in with that just as important and in fellowship and breaking of bread that's sharing a mill together that's what it means it's important when you shall share a meal with another believer and have fellowship that's not just american good southern hospitality tradition that's biblical breaking bread having fellowship one with another if god knew that these why did god put these in there he knew they'd be important that they'd have an importance to you and to me and in prayers let's all stand to our feet we're out of time this morning we just will pick that up amen lord willing next time lord we thank you father for your word this morning lord we value it greater than anything in our life that's why we read it that's why we look to it that's why we study it father lord it means

single one in this service we pray today we give it all to you in jesus name amen um
