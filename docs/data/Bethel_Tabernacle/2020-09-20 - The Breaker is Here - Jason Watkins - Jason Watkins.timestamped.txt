[1:24] do
[1:38] do
[2:06] do
[2:20] do
[2:34] do
[3:42] i'll be right here by the kevin good
[3:45] morning friends god bless you
[3:49] i want to begin straight away back into
[3:52] our sunday school lesson on the book of
[3:56] revelation
[3:58] and we were ending last time
[4:03] on um i was in the spirit
[4:06] on the lord's day john well we actually
[4:09] went to john
[4:10] um from verse 9 revelation
[4:14] chapter 1 verse 9 john who also
[4:18] excuse me am your brother and companion
[4:21] in tribulation and in the kingdom and
[4:24] patience of jesus christ
[4:27] and we moved through some concepts
[4:30] about how that he goes into verse 10
[4:33] and says i was in the spirit on the
[4:36] lord's day we want to deal a little bit
[4:38] more today
[4:41] on the day of the lord because it's
[4:43] quite vast
[4:44] actually one of the larger aspects of
[4:47] the first
[4:48] chapter but we were trying to
[4:51] show that that you're going to need the
[4:54] spirit you're going to need to be in the
[4:57] spirit to face
[4:59] the day of the lord because we certainly
[5:02] are at that day and i think that's why
[5:06] that verse 9 precedes with john
[5:09] saying right before he says i was in the
[5:12] spirit on the lord's day he says
[5:14] i am your fellow companion in
[5:17] tribulation
[5:18] and companion and tribulation
[5:21] and in the kingdom and patience of jesus
[5:23] christ and we dealt with
[5:25] the aspects of paul's imprisonment
[5:29] and you know the the trials that brother
[5:31] branham went through john's imprisonment
[5:34] on a roman penal colony the island of
[5:36] patmos which was basically a roman
[5:39] alcatraz if you will and it seemed
[5:43] counterintuitive if you look at that we
[5:45] were commenting on it last time
[5:47] that it seemed counter-intuitive to the
[5:49] purposes of the kingdom of god
[5:52] to have paul in a dungeon even to have
[5:54] paul on house arrest at certain times he
[5:56] was under
[5:57] house arrest under a guard but then
[5:59] there were other times
[6:01] if you've ever seen the nimitine prison
[6:04] where they lifted him up out of it
[6:06] um to actually execute him uh
[6:09] it's not it's not you wouldn't attribute
[6:11] that to house arrest
[6:13] and so you'd think that you know that
[6:16] john would have been spinning his wheels
[6:18] man here's two years
[6:19] lost and the value of john is so great
[6:22] surely god wouldn't let that happen but
[6:24] actually it served god's purpose
[6:27] for paul to be in prison in house arrest
[6:29] or in a dungeon
[6:32] it served god's purpose for brother
[6:34] branham
[6:35] and we kind of closed with that and went
[6:38] down through a little bit of
[6:39] uh of his life speaking about the trials
[6:42] that he went through
[6:44] born into abject poverty went through
[6:46] rejection as a
[6:47] boy rejection as a young man rejection
[6:50] by his family rejection by
[6:52] the ecumenical system and all doors
[6:56] closing to him
[6:57] yet it was all preparing him and even
[7:00] seemingly god rejecting him when he's
[7:02] pleading for the life of his
[7:04] of his infant daughter and brother
[7:07] branham talks about how that it takes
[7:09] that kind of a crushing
[7:11] uh but the rejection that he suffered
[7:14] you know was literally preparing him
[7:18] to deliver to the bride the greatest
[7:21] work of of teaching since the days
[7:25] when saint paul was writing the new
[7:28] testament to us
[7:29] since john come back from his island
[7:32] prison
[7:33] we have come to that day the day of the
[7:35] lord
[7:36] because as we have taught you that you
[7:39] constantly
[7:40] there's 10 different times in the book
[7:42] of revelation
[7:44] where he makes the statement i'm alpha
[7:46] and omega
[7:47] i'm the first and the last i'm the
[7:50] beginning and the end
[7:51] i'm he that was and is and and is
[7:54] forever more and so
[7:56] we find that that we we were showing how
[7:59] that brother branham brought that out to
[8:01] us
[8:02] that he was he was fully in the alpha he
[8:05] would be fully in the omega
[8:07] and while he would be in the in between
[8:11] everything in the in between wouldn't be
[8:14] completely him
[8:16] man made theory and dogma creeds of men
[8:19] would get injected to it
[8:21] god would carry on he would intercede
[8:23] for the ignorance of his family because
[8:25] you can't
[8:26] disbelieve what you don't know and so we
[8:29] find that's
[8:30] the the the sin that condemns someone is
[8:33] unbelief
[8:34] so we showed how that
[8:37] you know luther luther didn't know
[8:40] that he was an unbeliever in
[8:42] sanctification he didn't know that that
[8:44] revelation hadn't come yet wesley didn't
[8:47] know he was an unbeliever
[8:48] in the outpouring of the gifts if you
[8:50] read history
[8:52] church history that at the very end of
[8:54] the philadelphian age
[8:56] when they would have their big methodist
[8:58] campground meetings
[8:59] and uh methodist the methodist church
[9:01] had a big foothold here
[9:03] in the early days of america and uh they
[9:06] would
[9:07] they would shake and pass out and be
[9:10] slain in the spirit and they
[9:12] the methodists didn't know what they
[9:13] thought uh an evil spirit was taken
[9:15] they'd throw water in their face to wake
[9:17] them up and
[9:17] you know smack them come out of that you
[9:19] know that's that's the power of the
[9:20] devil
[9:20] they didn't know wesley's age didn't
[9:22] know they were unbelievers
[9:24] in the restoration of the gifts just
[9:27] like pentecost
[9:28] those early azuza fathers didn't know
[9:32] that they were
[9:32] unbelievers in the revealed word but it
[9:35] wasn't their time
[9:36] that would come in what we call the day
[9:38] of the lord
[9:40] and the day of the lord would encompass
[9:42] not only
[9:43] the judgments in the tribulation but the
[9:46] day of the lord
[9:47] would encompass the uh the beginning of
[9:51] the rapture in first thessalonians 4.
[9:53] that's the day of the lord that is the
[9:56] day that many
[9:58] or not many but some preachers in paul's
[10:01] day
[10:01] tried to tell the church that day's
[10:03] already arrived
[10:05] and the resurrection has passed and paul
[10:08] would say no
[10:09] that day what day the day of the lord
[10:12] that day cannot come til there come a
[10:15] falling away first and the man of sin be
[10:17] revealed so we realize that the day of
[10:19] the lord is a very broad term that takes
[10:21] in
[10:22] the tribulation the three and a half
[10:24] years the last half
[10:26] of daniel's 70th week or what the jews
[10:29] commonly refer to it as the time of
[10:31] jacob's trouble
[10:33] we realize that that the day of the lord
[10:35] pours out great wrath and the
[10:37] you know the uh people say yeah there's
[10:40] the plagues and there's the woes and
[10:41] there's all these different things
[10:43] and they're uh and the antichrist is
[10:44] coming and they're almost completely
[10:47] unaware
[10:48] that the antichrist has been working in
[10:49] the church from the inception
[10:51] that the woes two of them are already
[10:54] have already happened and
[10:56] the third is yet and so many of the of
[10:58] the vials
[11:00] and we see these things that have been
[11:01] poured out already happening and so
[11:04] while judgment the day of the lord is
[11:07] falling on the earth
[11:08] god is closing out denominational ages
[11:11] he's closing out laodicea church systems
[11:15] not the age at the end of laodicea the
[11:18] church goes in a rapture
[11:20] literally but you have to realize that
[11:23] and people say well revelation 4 1
[11:25] that's the rapture
[11:27] correct that's absolutely true and
[11:29] remember
[11:30] it's a voice that called from heaven to
[11:32] john now it's not a voice anymore on the
[11:34] earth
[11:35] john turned to hear a voice and when he
[11:38] turned to hear a voice
[11:40] he he didn't turn to see a man he turned
[11:44] to hear a vote to see a voice and the
[11:46] voice he saw the seven
[11:48] lamp stands so john literally is turning
[11:51] to see the church it's christ
[11:53] in the midst of the lamp stands walking
[11:56] by the holy ghost
[11:57] in the midst of his church it is the
[11:59] corporal body it's not the nail scarred
[12:01] man
[12:02] it's the corporal body brother branham
[12:04] takes that up that she was gird about
[12:05] the paps
[12:06] with a golden girdle that christ
[12:08] standing there in the image
[12:10] walking among the seven lampstands was
[12:13] uh
[12:13] uh his his his garment was girded about
[12:16] the pabst and brother branham said the
[12:17] symbolism of a woman
[12:19] he said look it's a woman because it was
[12:21] it was christ
[12:22] but it was christ in his bride the
[12:25] church is the female so
[12:26] so we realize that that john is now
[12:29] turning to hear a voice
[12:31] and he's seeing now the incarnate word
[12:35] again because remember that jesus
[12:38] was jesus before he was a human
[12:41] before he was a human he was the word
[12:44] that's i mean in the old testament how
[12:47] did those
[12:48] old testament saints ever find
[12:51] righteousness
[12:52] how were they uh accounted as righteous
[12:56] men like noah men like abraham how did
[12:59] they acquire
[13:00] abel when he offered his sacrifice how
[13:03] did they acquire this righteousness
[13:05] because they received a revelation of
[13:08] the word
[13:08] which was jesus in the beginning was the
[13:11] word jesus
[13:12] was the word and so he was jesus the
[13:16] bible teaches us in ephesians three
[13:18] that every there that everything that is
[13:21] made that was made
[13:22] it was made by jesus john also says
[13:24] there was nothing
[13:26] uh there was not anything made that was
[13:27] made without him making
[13:29] it john taught us that clearly so you
[13:32] have him in the old testament as the
[13:34] word
[13:34] you have the word becoming and living in
[13:36] a human body as the nazarene
[13:39] and then you have that same jesus that
[13:41] body the nazarene
[13:43] is laid on an altar and that life which
[13:46] is jesus
[13:47] met paul on the road to damascus as the
[13:50] pillar of fire
[13:51] and it is that pillar of fire that
[13:53] divided himself into the church
[13:55] and now the church is the corporal body
[13:59] of christ in the earth his nail-scarred
[14:03] body
[14:03] is laying on an altar in heaven he's now
[14:06] living in his church
[14:07] and so we find then that the that that
[14:10] you have to be
[14:12] in the spirit to catch all of this first
[14:15] of all we found
[14:16] out last time that you have to be in the
[14:18] spirit
[14:19] to endure the level of rejection you
[14:21] have to be in the spirit
[14:23] to endure the child training people do
[14:26] not endure
[14:27] child training who nor do they endure
[14:30] persecution
[14:30] jesus said that the seed sometimes falls
[14:34] on stony ground
[14:35] now don't think of of a field with a lot
[14:39] of stones in it
[14:40] think of a of a piece of granite stone
[14:43] like
[14:43] jutting out of a mountain and on the top
[14:46] of that
[14:46] is a thin layer of grass that has grown
[14:49] but it can only grow at a certain season
[14:52] as soon as the summer heat hits it and
[14:54] the sun gets up high
[14:56] that grass can't put roots down because
[14:58] it's on rock
[14:59] and therefore it gets blistered by the
[15:02] sun and withers
[15:03] and jesus says this is the one who for a
[15:06] time anons with joy
[15:08] but because of persecution because of
[15:10] rejection because of the trials
[15:13] that it requires to mold sons and
[15:16] daughters of god
[15:18] because of the heat that is required in
[15:20] the crucible
[15:21] uh you know and and the rejection and
[15:24] the and the things that we have to go
[15:26] through here and this
[15:27] is why paul would encourage the church
[15:30] especially the church who are alive and
[15:33] remain
[15:34] at the day of the lord or the coming of
[15:37] the lord
[15:38] the coming of the lord and the day of
[15:40] the lord and the judgment of god
[15:42] these are all one one
[15:45] one overlapping happening they happen
[15:48] in sequence it fires through a shout a
[15:51] voice
[15:51] and then a trumpet and then then then
[15:54] drug judgment falls
[15:56] on those who got left behind and the
[15:57] gospel picks up two prophets who go to
[15:59] the
[16:00] to the jews to the 144 000. this is all
[16:03] an unfolding sequence of events brother
[16:05] branham
[16:06] describes that how that five stars each
[16:09] one of those stars blow out at five
[16:11] and each one of those five blow out five
[16:13] and it's like a roman candle
[16:15] it just keeps going unto the
[16:17] consummation
[16:19] of the ages and so you have to be in the
[16:22] spirit on the lord's day you first got
[16:24] to get
[16:24] that you're going to be a companion in
[16:27] tribulation
[16:28] uh but you know that's why jesus would
[16:31] anoint paul to say
[16:32] all things work together for the good of
[16:35] them that love him
[16:37] don't worry it's the father's pleasure
[16:39] to give you the kingdom
[16:40] you're going to win in the end friends
[16:44] we see the day of the lord we see a day
[16:46] of mass hysteria
[16:48] we see a day of rampant chaos and
[16:50] insanity on the streets
[16:53] listen it for brother branham when he
[16:55] closes out 1964 i think in the message
[16:58] shalom
[16:59] he says you know to the effect i don't
[17:00] have it in front of me but
[17:02] to the effect that it's now he said it's
[17:04] a really dark time for the world
[17:06] because the seals had been open christ
[17:09] had been crucified
[17:10] the age went completely black they put
[17:12] christ out
[17:13] second crucifixion and indictment and we
[17:16] realized that the day of the lord
[17:19] had begun you get that the day of the
[17:21] lord had already started
[17:23] so so we realized then that that he says
[17:26] but it's a
[17:27] but it's a glo it's a dark time a sad
[17:30] time for the world
[17:31] but it's a glorious time for the bride
[17:33] because
[17:34] i because revelation 4 and isaiah 60
[17:38] correlate to being called up higher
[17:41] arise shine thy light has come yes
[17:45] darkness is on the age now it's done
[17:47] those those
[17:48] those church systems are finished
[17:50] they'll never rise again
[17:52] they've put christ out they'll never
[17:54] carry life again they were only
[17:56] temporary carriers
[17:57] to carry the life to the next age now
[18:00] that they've put christ out
[18:01] there's no life left in them are we
[18:04] still
[18:04] in laodicea as time we are because the
[18:07] bride goes in the rapture
[18:09] at the end of the laodicean age in time
[18:12] there's not
[18:13] an eighth age in time there's a there's
[18:16] a
[18:16] an eighth age is uh eighth day is a
[18:19] spiritual term
[18:20] that that represents back to the
[18:22] original
[18:23] back to the first so now we have the
[18:25] restoration of the token the restoration
[18:28] of the abstract
[18:29] the restoration of the jubilee we now
[18:32] have
[18:32] uh we now have a full abstract token
[18:36] titled deed and so we realized that
[18:40] it was a voice in heaven that
[18:43] called john higher now it's the exact
[18:46] same voice from heaven
[18:47] and revelation 18 4 that says come out
[18:50] of her my people
[18:51] it's the exact same voice in revelation
[18:55] 11 11 when moses and elijah
[18:58] are killed and they lay in the street
[19:01] which is jerusalem
[19:02] and the whole world sees them through
[19:04] satellite television
[19:06] and uh that that a voice calls from
[19:09] heaven
[19:09] come up hither and they are resurrected
[19:12] now
[19:12] you know people could say well then then
[19:15] then then that means that revelation 4
[19:18] 1 is is only applicable to our body
[19:22] change
[19:22] but that's not true because in
[19:25] revelation
[19:26] 11 11 that's that happens in a moment
[19:29] that's an instantaneous resurrection
[19:32] there's there's nothing leading up to
[19:34] that they're killed and then they're
[19:35] resurrected after three days
[19:37] but we realize that in revelation 4
[19:40] the rapture it starts a cycle
[19:44] not a one strike strike event it
[19:47] now first thessalonians 4 kicks off a
[19:50] shout
[19:51] a voice a trumpet and the tr and
[19:54] and and the the trumpet sounds the dead
[19:57] in christ rise and then we
[19:59] which are alive and remain in the earth
[20:02] are changed in a moment
[20:04] but you you'll never get to that change
[20:07] until you go through the process of
[20:09] redemption
[20:10] and the process of redemption can only
[20:13] come from christ and christ is the word
[20:16] and so the voice that he turns to see is
[20:19] the voice of
[20:20] the word and so he says i was in the
[20:23] spirit
[20:24] on the lord's day and so brother branham
[20:28] says here
[20:29] let me catch this couple of quotes here
[20:32] so he says here in the future home
[20:35] so the the one who goes in with jesus
[20:38] now how do you get into him by one
[20:41] spirit and he is the word you become
[20:45] part of him what part of him are you the
[20:48] word
[20:49] that's living of this hour recognizing
[20:53] you'll
[20:53] walk with him in the millennium that's a
[20:56] beautiful
[20:57] statement you will walk with him in the
[21:00] millennium i want you to understand
[21:02] something friends he's on his way to the
[21:05] throne
[21:05] so walk with him if you walk with
[21:09] somebody headed to the throne
[21:10] you're headed to the throne so he so
[21:14] so received the word of this hour you're
[21:18] in the day of the lord the day of the
[21:21] lord
[21:21] is not something yet in the future the
[21:25] the rapture mystery is here the
[21:27] revelation to change your body is here
[21:30] the the trumpet has sounded the jubilee
[21:33] is now
[21:34] sounded we've been loosed from the
[21:36] bondage of man-made systems
[21:38] and we're already effectively being
[21:41] translated
[21:42] starting in our soul controlling our
[21:44] spirit
[21:45] lording over our flesh by the word of
[21:47] god and eventually we get a body
[21:50] likened unto his glorified body so
[21:53] you want to be part of the word that was
[21:56] to come in the lord's day
[21:59] as paul said that day shall not come
[22:01] until
[22:02] well that until has been now because
[22:06] until the man of sin be made known and
[22:08] that's what a prophet did in this age
[22:10] he made known the man of sin he's not he
[22:13] doesn't get it
[22:14] he's not identified particularly because
[22:17] he hasn't begun his ride particularly he
[22:19] can't begin his ride
[22:21] until the bride is gone but a prophet
[22:23] was able to identify him by the bible
[22:27] and point to the beast system of rome
[22:29] and point to all of that
[22:30] man-made systems of blasphemous names
[22:34] and brother branham's called him death
[22:36] because that's what john
[22:37] identified him as and brother branham
[22:39] took a scripture
[22:40] and a reality and connected the dot and
[22:42] said that's who death
[22:44] is but he can't begin his full right so
[22:46] the day of the lord
[22:48] is unfolding and and in the
[22:51] it is in the day of the lord that a
[22:54] people
[22:55] returned back to the full spirit
[22:58] for john to see the day of the lord he
[23:01] had to have the full spirit he couldn't
[23:03] have a dip
[23:04] of the spirit like the ages had he
[23:06] couldn't have a partial
[23:07] understanding like the ages had he he
[23:10] had to have the
[23:11] full token life and that
[23:14] comes at the day of the lord it awakens
[23:17] a
[23:18] a a bride it raises her up to be the
[23:21] voice
[23:22] of god in the world the final voice to
[23:23] the final age
[23:25] it sets the chaos and madness on the
[23:27] streets that we see
[23:29] and eventually it'll translate a bride
[23:31] then go to the jews
[23:32] and the world will spin off into those
[23:35] last 42 months of destruction
[23:37] so we so we find then that
[23:41] that he's headed toward the millennium
[23:44] so
[23:45] this is why you know paul would say that
[23:48] they
[23:48] who are in the flesh cannot please god
[23:51] one of the greatest privileges that you
[23:54] have
[23:55] to be in the spirit during this time of
[23:59] the lord's day
[24:00] is that is that you have the ability to
[24:03] reproduce
[24:04] jesus christ if you live according to
[24:07] the flesh
[24:08] you'll never do that because the flesh
[24:11] is weak it's full of sin it's not
[24:13] converted
[24:14] and even as a son and daughter of god
[24:16] you will never show christ to the world
[24:19] you've got to live by the spirit
[24:23] so so we see then that that
[24:26] that there is a supernatural thing
[24:29] that is going on inside of us
[24:33] by this spirit that comes
[24:36] in the day of the lord the principle is
[24:39] that
[24:40] if we get this spirit of god
[24:43] then it's there then then there is no
[24:46] it's no more
[24:47] you just living it by your willpower
[24:51] it's literally the life of christ
[24:53] because
[24:54] your willpower won't do it
[24:57] you will stay frustrated all your life
[25:01] trying to live a good christian life
[25:04] you will suffer constant frustration
[25:08] why because it's too hard today it's too
[25:11] wicked today why is it
[25:13] because it's the day of the lord you
[25:15] understand
[25:16] christ has been put out of the church
[25:18] there's the earth now has
[25:20] no more contact with with christ
[25:24] except through a bride that's how
[25:27] wicked it is and so there you'll be
[25:30] frustrated trying to live by your own
[25:32] willpower it has to be
[25:35] christ living in you all right let me
[25:38] see i've got um
[25:40] a couple of minutes i i think i will
[25:42] stop right there
[25:44] uh i've got actually one minute without
[25:46] going into overtime so we will
[25:48] we will conclude right there for today i
[25:51] don't want to go any further
[25:53] um i i was going to try to get down to
[25:57] verse 11 but we will save that so let's
[26:00] pray
[26:01] father we thank you for your word today
[26:04] thank you for our sunday school lesson
[26:06] and we pray that lord it will be
[26:07] effectual to the people
[26:09] that they may gain strength from it
[26:11] father and gain
[26:12] understanding of the life they live in
[26:14] the world they're present in
[26:16] may it be so father we commit it to you
[26:18] and the remaining service into your
[26:20] hands in jesus name
[26:21] god bless you
[26:47] you
