[44:58] amen let's turn in the
[45:00] scripture uh right away to Isaiah
[45:02] chapter
[45:05] 19 and going to give
[45:08] a a missionary report this evening so we
[45:13] can all just relax and the the greatest
[45:16] danger that you'll face tonight is that
[45:18] the Lord will tell you to you to go on a
[45:20] missions trip
[45:23] so right sister Rachel
[45:28] amen so uh Isaiah 19 and verse 1
[45:32] through3 and then we'll read a little
[45:33] bit more towards the end of the
[45:37] chapter the burden of Egypt behold the
[45:41] Lord rideth upon a swift cloud and shall
[45:43] come into Egypt and the idols of Egypt
[45:45] shall be moved at his presence and the
[45:48] Heart of Egypt shall melt in the midst
[45:50] of it and I will set the Egyptians
[45:53] against the Egyptians and they shall
[45:54] fight everyone against his brother and
[45:56] everyone against his neighbor City
[45:58] against City and Kingdom against Kingdom
[46:00] and the spirit of Egypt shall fail in
[46:01] the midst thereof and I will destroy the
[46:03] council thereof and they shall seek to
[46:06] the idols and to the Charmers and to
[46:08] them that have familiar spirits and to
[46:10] the
[46:11] Wizards all right then skip forward I
[46:14] believe
[46:15] to yeah verse verse
[46:17] 19 uh in that day shall there be an
[46:21] altar to the Lord in the midst of the
[46:22] land of Egypt and a pillar at the border
[46:25] thereof to the Lord and it shall be for
[46:27] a sign and for a witness unto the Lord
[46:29] of hosts in the land of Egypt for they
[46:31] shall cry unto the Lord because of the
[46:33] oppressors and he shall send them a
[46:35] savior and a great one and he shall
[46:37] deliver them and the Lord shall be known
[46:39] to Egypt and the Egyptians shall know
[46:41] the Lord in that day and shall do
[46:43] sacrifice and oblation yeay they shall
[46:45] vow a vow unto the Lord and perform it
[46:48] and the Lord shall Smite Egypt he shall
[46:50] Smite and heal it and they shall return
[46:52] even to the Lord and he shall be
[46:54] entreated of them and shall heal them
[46:58] let's pray Heavenly Father we come
[46:59] before you Lord and we ask for your just
[47:02] Holy Spirit to be Sovereign over each
[47:04] heart and each mind Lord that as we go
[47:06] through the reports and speak about what
[47:08] you have done Lord we ask that you would
[47:10] be glorified and magnified and lifted up
[47:13] father we commit ourselves and our time
[47:16] in the word and fellowship together
[47:18] tonight into your hands For Your Glory
[47:20] in Jesus name amen
[47:27] brother
[47:28] Josh wake
[47:33] up amen so um as we get that up just a
[47:39] little explanation of that scripture um
[47:42] I'm not trying to say that my trip was
[47:46] that I'm trying to point out that God
[47:49] has a plan for Egypt for Egyptians and
[47:53] of course uh we know we we know many
[47:56] things about God's plan for Israel as
[47:59] well U there's also many things that we
[48:02] that are mysterious that are uh
[48:04] difficult to understand and we don't
[48:06] can't piece it together you know brother
[48:08] Branham makes it clear that the two
[48:11] witnesses are the ones that call the
[48:14] 144,000 but he also says in the church
[48:16] ages book just as the Jews brought the
[48:18] gospel to the Gentiles the Gentiles will
[48:20] bring the gospel back to the Jews again
[48:23] I I'm just here being obedient so I'm
[48:27] not trying to make something anything of
[48:30] myself um but I do believe that the Lord
[48:33] has a plan yes amen and he has a purpose
[48:37] and that he's moving uh for some purpose
[48:40] I think all we can say usually Brother
[48:43] Brad when we go and preach somewhere you
[48:46] know some someone else might look from
[48:47] the outside and say my that was
[48:49] wonderful we just say I I'm just
[48:52] here I'm just doing what the Lord asked
[48:54] me to do thank you um and uh trying
[48:58] trying my best to remain humble and
[49:01] usable um in his hands
[49:05] amen you know that's the that's the the
[49:08] worst thing that you can do is get proud
[49:09] and lifted up and try to
[49:11] elevate yourself to be something
[49:15] special um we're just Servants of the
[49:19] Lord and whatever we can do to serve him
[49:23] and serve his people we're ready to go
[49:25] to whatever land L that is that he calls
[49:27] us to do even even that's nothing even
[49:30] if that's stay home and serve your
[49:31] family we're ready to do that
[49:35] amen all right got on a plane from
[49:38] Atlanta went to Charles de gal had a lay
[49:40] over there and flew into Tel Aviv got in
[49:45] there um it was weird because the
[49:49] airport was very quiet of course we know
[49:51] why there's war going on in in Israel
[49:54] right now um so very quick quickly got
[49:58] through customs and everything and it
[50:00] was it was easy
[50:02] um um just got to remind myself not to
[50:07] do certain things if everybody remembers
[50:10] from last time but met the brother there
[50:13] in his hometown uh that's how I'm going
[50:15] to put that and uh got to fellowship
[50:18] with him we went out this is just my
[50:21] marker to remind me we went out for
[50:23] dinner and fellowship with him and I
[50:26] don't have his picture because he wants
[50:28] to remain as Anonymous as possible
[50:31] because in Israel they have their their
[50:34] herid um uh Orthodox Jews are extremely
[50:38] anti-missionary anti- um uh uh EV EV
[50:45] anti-christian let's just put it that
[50:47] way and they they they hate Christians
[50:51] they hate Jesus so and they're they're
[50:54] ready they're ready to expose every
[50:56] everyone a missionary that we that all
[50:58] of us know um was exposed by them and
[51:02] has had difficulty because because of
[51:04] that but make no mistake we're not there
[51:07] to try to call the
[51:10] 144,000 we're not there to do Mass
[51:13] evangelism we're there to be obedient to
[51:15] the Lord and serve God's people however
[51:17] that turns out um it's in his hands I
[51:22] believe God works sovereignly when I go
[51:25] I don't feel pressure to perform or be
[51:28] great or anything I'm just here
[51:30] Lord use me for your purpose accomplish
[51:34] what you want want to accomplish and um
[51:37] first so the first night we went out and
[51:38] had fellowship and discussed the trip
[51:41] and discussed their life since the the
[51:43] um the war started I was surprised in
[51:47] the area that he lives in is is a ways
[51:49] away from I mean it's funny aways away
[51:52] two and a half hours from the Gaza Strip
[51:55] but far enough to where I I other than
[51:58] the fact that there was no tourists I
[52:00] didn't see any sign of of War there in U
[52:06] in
[52:07] Israel um even even going into Galilee
[52:10] and going past some of the um uh Air
[52:13] Force bases I didn't I didn't even see a
[52:16] fighter jet I see more fighter jets here
[52:18] than I did did there which was
[52:20] surprising the the main thing I only saw
[52:22] was that blimp if you remember the big
[52:24] white blimp they had it was was way up
[52:27] in the air that they used that to
[52:29] triangulate things with the uh David
[52:31] sling and the Iron Dome in order to
[52:34] shoot anything down coming from the
[52:36] north and from from Lebanon and from
[52:38] Syria so the other thing that was
[52:41] interesting when I when I went to uh the
[52:45] the next morning we got up somewhat
[52:47] early and we went up to hia to try to
[52:52] get into see um Elijah's cave um it's
[52:56] it's like a monastery now of course like
[52:58] anything else it's becomes a Catholic
[53:00] church it's either a Jewish place which
[53:03] then they let you get in or it's a
[53:04] Catholic place and then it's it's hit or
[53:07] miss and today was the day that that I
[53:09] was there in hia it was uh the after
[53:13] Friday afternoon which means
[53:14] everything's starting to shut down for
[53:16] Shabbat and so we couldn't get in there
[53:19] but we had a a very uh long hike down to
[53:22] get to the place and then we had to hike
[53:24] back up after that after not seeing
[53:26] anything
[53:28] so but what was interesting was as soon
[53:30] as we got to hia it said I was in Beirut
[53:32] Lebanon at the airport and the reason
[53:34] for that is in Israel in the north and
[53:37] in the South they scramble the
[53:39] GPS so unless you're unless you you
[53:41] should start your your directions when
[53:45] you're on Wi-Fi otherwise you'll be all
[53:47] mixed up and even even sometimes it
[53:49] would it would bounce you to say you
[53:51] have to drive from Lebanon to wherever
[53:53] you are I'm like thank the Lord I'm not
[53:55] in Lebanon
[53:58] um and I I they started doing that even
[54:00] now in in even in central Israel in in
[54:04] Jerusalem Tel Aviv and so forth so
[54:08] um there's the skyline of
[54:12] hia um up above it and then in if you
[54:16] can see in the distance there's sort of
[54:17] like a hill mountain range in the far
[54:20] far distance right at the top of that
[54:22] Hill is the Lebanon border I would say
[54:26] it's about 30 miles from where I'm
[54:29] standing amen right
[54:32] there and we had a youth meeting I got
[54:37] myself a little bit out of order here
[54:38] that's all right this was our Sunday
[54:40] afternoon service brother Jason this is
[54:42] Brother Sergey he had a picture of
[54:45] himself with you and uh brother
[54:50] Eugene uh in Ukraine that's where he's
[54:53] originally from and has since moved to I
[54:57] think it's probably 10 years ago
[55:00] something like that or maybe even
[55:02] more yeah um and so he has a little
[55:06] Church of of Russians and Jews in his
[55:09] home and he asked me to minister the
[55:12] afternoon service on
[55:15] Shabbat and uh had fellowship with them
[55:18] and just a simple humble people it's
[55:22] it's uh Russians can be a little quiet
[55:24] to preach to sometimes
[55:26] but uh they led the word amen and
[55:30] they're they're they're they were really
[55:33] uh
[55:35] focused we had a youth meeting on the
[55:37] Friday
[55:39] night um of Shabbat and I ministered
[55:43] there on
[55:45] freedom and it was interesting because I
[55:48] I was all day I was struggling with my
[55:51] subject with
[55:52] them and I just I couldn't I couldn't
[55:56] get a hold of what I was supposed to
[55:58] speak to them about and I I get in get
[56:01] in we get into the their Church there
[56:04] and I pull up and I just I I had nothing
[56:07] and finally finally it just it as we
[56:10] were about to start pulled pulled it up
[56:12] and Minister on freedom I had a a sermon
[56:16] for youth on freedom
[56:18] and uh told me afterwards is it really
[56:23] it's a it's a message about you know
[56:26] Satan offers you freedom but what is
[56:30] freedom and you know what Satan offers
[56:34] is his lordship Christ offers his
[56:37] lordship which produces true freedom
[56:39] because you could live the way God has
[56:41] designed you to live versus Satan's
[56:44] lordship which is purports to be free
[56:47] but actually brings destruction pain
[56:50] sorrow
[56:52] suffering
[56:54] and so it's SP spent quite a bit of time
[56:57] on that and after the service he's like
[57:00] I don't even he's like I don't really
[57:01] know what to say other than the fact
[57:03] that you couldn't
[57:04] have if you would have known everything
[57:07] that was happening here you wouldn't
[57:09] have designed a a a sermon so perfect
[57:12] for what some of the young people
[57:14] are going going through here um then we
[57:18] answered a bunch of questions there and
[57:20] unfortunately you could tell that there
[57:22] was some that there was real unbelief
[57:25] going on in some of the question
[57:26] questions and I I found it interesting
[57:29] because from this meeting there was two
[57:31] young young people that were really
[57:33] struggling and they were feeding off
[57:36] each other and really you know hurting
[57:39] hurting one another
[57:42] yeah with with
[57:44] unbelief and very strange different
[57:46] questions that you would imagine ever
[57:49] getting but from a Jewish perspective
[57:52] they live in a herid community very
[57:55] radical
[57:56] Jewish group and some of the questions
[57:58] are like well what's the what's the
[58:01] what's the significance and the purpose
[58:02] of the New Testament and you go have you
[58:05] read the New Testament
[58:08] before it's it's not a question that you
[58:10] would ever get usually from our
[58:12] perspective you hear what's the validity
[58:15] of the Old
[58:17] Testament what's the point of that and
[58:20] so of course went through and answered
[58:22] as best I could and some questions about
[58:24] some past traumas that they had so I
[58:28] spoke some about the dangers of
[58:31] psychology and what it offers and and
[58:35] the you know the Bible shows us that
[58:37] there's
[58:38] deliverance and if we we obey God's word
[58:41] every everything that psychology offers
[58:42] is actually a counterfeit to God's
[58:46] word and every aspect of it you know you
[58:49] have a you have I won't get I won't go
[58:52] into it you can listen to my podcast
[58:53] coming out in a couple weeks that's
[58:55] going to go into details about it
[58:58] but into what just like again what he's
[59:02] like that girl asked me those questions
[59:05] last week and I I gave her some answers
[59:07] but you went you she didn't even tell
[59:10] you what was going on she just asked the
[59:11] question and you went directly to what
[59:14] she was dealing with and so between
[59:18] these two young people one person
[59:20] decided you know I'm just going to go to
[59:21] the world I'm done the other one came
[59:25] forward the next Sunday or the next uh
[59:28] Shabbat service and repented and asked
[59:32] to be prayed for to receive the baptism
[59:34] of the Holy Ghost so I was so thankful
[59:38] to hear that another brother that I had
[59:41] I dealt with and and the brother over
[59:43] there had been dealing with uh came and
[59:46] said he felt the calling of the Lord to
[59:49] begin Ministry there and out and and
[59:51] Outreach there brother there so just
[59:54] very thankful for for how the Lord
[59:57] worked
[59:59] and the next day we were blessed to be
[1:00:02] able to go have a picnic and go fishing
[1:00:04] on the Sea of Galilee with the with some
[1:00:07] of the Believers there and that was
[1:00:09] wonderful it was very peaceful most of
[1:00:11] the time except for the part where an
[1:00:13] Arab guy had his um pop Arab music
[1:00:18] playing and then it was the most
[1:00:20] annoying thing I've ever heard in my
[1:00:21] entire
[1:00:23] life but other than that it was very
[1:00:26] peaceful we we asked him to turn it down
[1:00:28] and he would turn it down for 5 minutes
[1:00:30] and then Crank It Up And when I say loud
[1:00:31] I mean we were a long ways away and it
[1:00:33] was like I had airpods
[1:00:39] in
[1:00:41] um yeah the and the next day I felt to
[1:00:44] speak on overcoming depression I don't
[1:00:46] think I have any pictures from that
[1:00:48] service there but then and same thing
[1:00:51] quite a number of the Believers in the
[1:00:53] church came to their pastor and said you
[1:00:55] know
[1:00:57] know he was dealing with exactly what I
[1:01:00] was have been going through and and the
[1:01:02] struggles that I have there um it's a
[1:01:07] it's a multicultural Church there that
[1:01:10] um sister Deb brother Travis um my wife
[1:01:15] brother Matt sister Rachel know by being
[1:01:18] there that um there's there's Filipino
[1:01:22] and African and Jewish and Russian and
[1:01:26] Ukrainian
[1:01:28] and other other believers there this
[1:01:30] time there was a brother uh many of the
[1:01:33] Africans there that they they work in um
[1:01:37] and again I wish I had pictures of these
[1:01:38] brothers I didn't I didn't get any at
[1:01:40] the time but a number of them work in
[1:01:43] farmwork they're they got like a 5-year
[1:01:45] visa to come work on farmwork and they
[1:01:48] their family is there so there's people
[1:01:50] from Malawi zomia Kenya Ghana and so
[1:01:56] forth um there and just got a chance to
[1:01:59] meet one brother he he literally lives
[1:02:01] and works right on the edge of the Gaza
[1:02:04] Strip in fact right next to one of the
[1:02:05] towns that was attacked on October 7th
[1:02:07] he was there when it when it happened
[1:02:10] didn't didn't uh he didn't he didn't uh
[1:02:13] have any troubles when he was there but
[1:02:16] um he he works there in a plant every
[1:02:18] every day and some other believers work
[1:02:22] up in the north along all those towns
[1:02:24] have been evacuated but the Farms are
[1:02:26] there and so some of the Believers are
[1:02:29] working on those Farms next to the
[1:02:32] Lebanon
[1:02:33] border all
[1:02:36] right got got a little bit of History uh
[1:02:40] enrichment in we went to be
[1:02:43] Sheen and if anybody if anybody knows
[1:02:47] the significance of beit Sheen I
[1:02:50] will uh run a lap around the a church
[1:02:53] because
[1:02:56] you do never mind I'll do it afterwards
[1:03:00] Matt I don't want to interrupt the
[1:03:04] service what's the significance Saul
[1:03:08] Saul and Jonathan's bodies were hung on
[1:03:11] the wall at be Sheen and so we we got to
[1:03:14] go there and it's a incredibly well
[1:03:17] preserved um Roman and bizantine
[1:03:21] city um this is probably the best
[1:03:24] preserved Amphitheater in all of the
[1:03:25] Roman Empire that they have their I
[1:03:28] think I can't remember I think it's seed
[1:03:30] like 4,000 or something like
[1:03:32] that and it's like it's like uh the one
[1:03:35] in
[1:03:37] um uh cesaria By the Sea where you can
[1:03:40] go stand in the bottom and just speak
[1:03:42] quietly and you can hear anywhere up on
[1:03:45] the top the the Acoustics are just
[1:03:49] incredible that's that's from the big
[1:03:52] hill overlooking the city a little tough
[1:03:55] to see but
[1:03:56] uh
[1:03:59] um beautiful mosaics there that's a
[1:04:03] lion design then I got to go see the
[1:04:06] Gideon's cave where everyone where they
[1:04:10] separated the the the Army based on how
[1:04:14] they drank the water got to see that
[1:04:16] spring in the cave
[1:04:19] there so that was pretty
[1:04:23] cool and then I think the next next
[1:04:26] day um a lot of what I did on this uh
[1:04:30] the last part when I was in Israel was
[1:04:32] just spend time with the pastor and his
[1:04:34] family and and fellowship with them and
[1:04:37] talk with them that you know it's it's a
[1:04:39] lonely walk that they have that the Lord
[1:04:41] has led him to and so um just tried to
[1:04:45] encourage them over there and the
[1:04:47] brother and I went up
[1:04:49] to
[1:04:51] AKO and beautiful city it's the old uh
[1:04:56] uh City Paul
[1:04:58] Paul uh went out of there on his on his
[1:05:01] way to Rome and encouraged Believers
[1:05:04] that were living in this town it was
[1:05:06] called uh something else back then but
[1:05:09] um it also became a crusader City so I
[1:05:12] don't know if the video is going to play
[1:05:14] no it's not videos aren't working so
[1:05:18] this was
[1:05:20] like can you press play from your end
[1:05:29] not coming
[1:05:33] up no well you can go to my
[1:05:38] Instagram and watch the video
[1:05:41] there
[1:05:43] uh and then so the next day it's just
[1:05:46] crazy so look look how
[1:05:49] close Tel Aviv is to Cairo it's just
[1:05:52] barely off the screen there um Travis
[1:05:56] knows it's just like an hour flight
[1:05:58] between t Eve but because of the war a
[1:06:01] lot of the main uh Arab Nations have
[1:06:05] cancelled their normal uh flight between
[1:06:09] uh Tel Aviv and there so I had to take
[1:06:12] some a cheaper Airline all the way over
[1:06:17] to
[1:06:20] Dubai and
[1:06:23] then all the way back it was a 19 hour
[1:06:26] day to do that which normally would have
[1:06:28] taken about 3
[1:06:30] hours so I was
[1:06:33] uh not
[1:06:36] fun I got to enjoy Dubai all by
[1:06:42] myself they had nice restaurants and a
[1:06:44] lot of really nice Filipino people
[1:06:46] working in
[1:06:50] them after getting into Egypt um spent a
[1:06:54] few days in Cairo had fellowship with
[1:06:58] brother megali he has started his new
[1:07:01] little church there in a new community
[1:07:04] and uh has a lot of uh poor people
[1:07:08] coming to the church now and he's he's
[1:07:11] working with them to help introduce them
[1:07:14] to the message he has a number of you
[1:07:16] see
[1:07:18] the uh African people there he's got a
[1:07:21] number of Sudanese people coming to the
[1:07:24] church that live in this
[1:07:26] uh poor Christian
[1:07:28] neighborhood if you're not
[1:07:31] familiar um all across Egypt there is a
[1:07:34] a pretty decent sized population of
[1:07:38] Christians that live there you know most
[1:07:40] people think of an Arab nation and um
[1:07:43] the Muslims have basically converted or
[1:07:46] killed all the
[1:07:48] Christians that's the case in most of
[1:07:51] them but in Egypt they had a a very
[1:07:54] large um contingent of Christians and
[1:07:57] it's disputed about what percentage it
[1:07:59] is because what percentage affects uh
[1:08:02] their numbers in Parliament and so they
[1:08:04] say they used to say like 5% of the
[1:08:06] country was um Coptic Christian which is
[1:08:11] it's very funny it's it's probably more
[1:08:14] like 30 to
[1:08:16] 40% but they suppress those numbers
[1:08:18] because they don't want to have 40% of
[1:08:21] their Parliament made up of Christians
[1:08:23] it would be a problem big problem for
[1:08:26] them so um this this neighborhood we
[1:08:29] went into and uh again just they're very
[1:08:34] simple poor humble people this is the
[1:08:37] church that brother megal got into so
[1:08:39] much trouble for if you
[1:08:40] remember um and what he's what he's
[1:08:43] facing now he was able to get after I
[1:08:45] left he was able to get a visa and he's
[1:08:48] in uh Germany now he's going to spend
[1:08:50] some time there and in Norway
[1:08:53] ministering and uh um out of the country
[1:08:56] for a few months so his lawyer can kind
[1:08:58] of take care of the uh jail time issue
[1:09:02] that he was going to have so I think
[1:09:04] that should be no issue and he should be
[1:09:07] able to be back in Egypt by the end of
[1:09:10] June usually brother megaly translates
[1:09:13] for me but if we have a conference or if
[1:09:15] he's able to brother George his son
[1:09:18] translates for me who has gone to an
[1:09:20] English speaking school since he's very
[1:09:23] young so he's he's extremely fluent and
[1:09:25] a very gifted translator pray for him
[1:09:28] that the Lord would just would really I
[1:09:30] would just say give him the baptism of
[1:09:32] the Holy Ghost because he's he's a
[1:09:35] really gifted person gifted personality
[1:09:37] and be very useful for the kingdom of
[1:09:40] God if he would
[1:09:42] surrender and uh some Believers there
[1:09:46] that brother megal is next to me and
[1:09:49] then brother Mina sorry uh Mina because
[1:09:54] in Egypt it's a boy's name it was funny
[1:09:56] I was uh just doing some introductions
[1:09:59] at the beginning of the service and
[1:10:00] talking about my family and I said I'm I
[1:10:02] said just so everyone knows here in the
[1:10:05] rest of the world Mina is a girl's name
[1:10:09] and so I told my daughter that Mina is a
[1:10:12] boy's name in Egypt she says I never dad
[1:10:14] I never want to go to Egypt and they got
[1:10:17] a kick out of
[1:10:18] that they were just as shocked as I was
[1:10:21] that Mina is a girl's name elsewhere and
[1:10:24] so this is Brother Mina
[1:10:26] and uh sincere brother loves the message
[1:10:29] and is learning learning it and growing
[1:10:31] in it brother megali and I outside of
[1:10:34] one of the
[1:10:35] churches there um I this is I had a
[1:10:38] little bit of experience with it but
[1:10:40] this is really my first experience with
[1:10:42] African roads and um it's interesting
[1:10:46] for
[1:10:47] sure I don't know why they even try to
[1:10:49] pave them because the paving makes it
[1:10:54] worse the road and then it just breaks
[1:10:57] up and so it's just it's a giant pothole
[1:11:00] it's not a pothole it's just a the whole
[1:11:03] Road as a pothole and by the time you're
[1:11:05] done you're not sure if some of your
[1:11:07] internal organs have detached or
[1:11:10] not so this is one of those little areas
[1:11:13] that we went
[1:11:14] into um this is like this is the this is
[1:11:18] the center area between two lanes of
[1:11:20] traffic traffic and and I I think sewage
[1:11:23] and water and
[1:11:25] that's where all the garbage
[1:11:27] goes
[1:11:29] so this is the pastor at the first uh
[1:11:34] church that I ministered
[1:11:37] at and uh this was like on the outsides
[1:11:41] of outskirts of
[1:11:44] Cairo and ministered on water baptism
[1:11:46] there just to give a little background
[1:11:50] to this group um brother megal has
[1:11:55] become friends with this Pentecostal
[1:11:59] denomination they've got an they've got
[1:12:01] the Assemblies of God there that's a
[1:12:03] whole other story but um this group this
[1:12:08] denomination broke off from the
[1:12:09] Assemblies of God because of tongues um
[1:12:14] they they didn't agree that tongues was
[1:12:15] the initial evidence of the Holy Ghost
[1:12:18] so they separated but they're
[1:12:19] Pentecostal and first place I ministered
[1:12:23] I felt on my heart to speak about water
[1:12:25] baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:12:27] Christ and uh I could tell the pastor
[1:12:30] was a little bit shocked about it and
[1:12:33] after the service we prayed for some
[1:12:35] sick people and people that wanted
[1:12:37] children and and uh hit the road back to
[1:12:40] the hotel on the way I could tell
[1:12:42] brother megaly and this guy were uh in a
[1:12:45] disagreement over something and uh I
[1:12:49] asked brother megaly what's going on he
[1:12:50] said well first he said that uh water
[1:12:55] why is he preaching on baptism in the
[1:12:57] name of Jesus Christ I said oh uh was it
[1:13:01] unscriptural brother megal asked him was
[1:13:03] it unscriptural uh no everything that
[1:13:06] was was said was in the Bible he said hm
[1:13:09] okay so
[1:13:12] um which is right the Bible or the
[1:13:14] Pentecostal
[1:13:16] church and he the brother said the
[1:13:19] Bible's right a few days later down the
[1:13:22] road we got a call from the their Bishop
[1:13:24] who lives in Germany
[1:13:25] said this guy this guy called me and was
[1:13:27] complaining about what brother Jason was
[1:13:29] preaching on in the in the uh
[1:13:33] church and he's like oh yeah what' you
[1:13:36] tell him he said I asked him it was
[1:13:38] anything that he said outside of the
[1:13:40] Bible and the pastor told him
[1:13:43] no and the the bishop said then what's
[1:13:46] the
[1:13:49] problem so I was surprised by that this
[1:13:53] this brother in Germany I call call the
[1:13:55] Bishop they're just call him the manager
[1:13:57] of the
[1:13:59] denomination he's like the president of
[1:14:01] their board or whatever he he he know he
[1:14:05] lives near bebber and has a Pentecostal
[1:14:08] Church near bebber and he knows brother
[1:14:11] gird ravald very well brother gird has
[1:14:14] actually had him translate uh building
[1:14:17] stones into Arabic in the past and um so
[1:14:21] he's been introduced to the message and
[1:14:24] he's told Brother megali that's good for
[1:14:26] you it's not for me but I support you in
[1:14:28] it and I appreciate you I appreciate
[1:14:31] much of it I think maybe he's a little
[1:14:33] bit stuck I'm not sure we'll see what
[1:14:35] happens
[1:14:36] but after that of course this sends a
[1:14:40] stir amongst everybody about preaching
[1:14:42] on water baptism in the name of the Lord
[1:14:44] Jesus Christ but um after that the next
[1:14:48] Services we had um we went down
[1:14:53] to the
[1:14:56] let's
[1:14:58] see there we go we went from Cairo down
[1:15:02] to the city of
[1:15:05] assut in what they call Upper Egypt I
[1:15:08] was very confused Upper Egypt why are we
[1:15:11] going south to go to Upper
[1:15:14] Egypt and
[1:15:16] um uh again there's a
[1:15:19] video unfortunately it's not going to
[1:15:21] play that's brother megaly saying we're
[1:15:23] going down to Upper Egypt and going to
[1:15:27] be visiting 10
[1:15:29] churches so there you go Lower Egypt is
[1:15:33] the North Upper Egypt is the South and
[1:15:37] there's a very simple reason for that is
[1:15:38] the
[1:15:39] Nile comes from the south to the north
[1:15:44] so it's that's why it is called Upper
[1:15:46] Egypt and of course most of Upper Egypt
[1:15:49] is Desert most of Egypt is desert but
[1:15:53] right along the river it's very very
[1:15:56] fertile it's dusty it's dirty but it's
[1:15:58] very fertile
[1:16:00] ground and again I had a nice video that
[1:16:04] everybody could see the Sahara Desert go
[1:16:07] to my Instagram Channel and find it we
[1:16:11] we when we started we went first to uh
[1:16:15] the Lilian
[1:16:16] Trasher uh orphanage how many are
[1:16:19] familiar with lilan
[1:16:21] Trasher how many of you have Amazon
[1:16:25] how many of you are going to go on and
[1:16:27] Order her testimony
[1:16:29] tonight get her testimony she she uh
[1:16:33] those those um books Heroes of the faith
[1:16:36] for young for young children um she is
[1:16:40] one of the testimonies and it's it's
[1:16:42] tremendous how the Lord led her and
[1:16:44] dealt with her she was very significant
[1:16:47] in bringing uh the Assemblies of God
[1:16:49] Church she started out in Holiness
[1:16:52] movement when she moved there and when
[1:16:55] auza Street struck she she she accepted
[1:16:59] some missionaries that came from auza
[1:17:01] Street and helped with them bringing
[1:17:05] Pentecost to
[1:17:07] Egypt
[1:17:10] um we'll talk a little bit more about
[1:17:12] that but it's a wonderful testimony look
[1:17:14] look her up Lillian Trasher she's
[1:17:16] actually born in
[1:17:19] Jacksonville so this is common this was
[1:17:22] the outside this is someone's little
[1:17:24] farming Hut uh right next to the area we
[1:17:28] were dropped off for the first church
[1:17:31] that I preached at in Upper
[1:17:33] Egypt and uh it was a I was really
[1:17:38] shocked and surprised and blessed by the
[1:17:41] opportunity to go and see these churches
[1:17:44] there's 65 of these Pentecostal churches
[1:17:47] that have opened the door to myself and
[1:17:49] brother megal and I ministered at 10 of
[1:17:53] them and they were very very very happy
[1:17:56] to have us I felt every every time I had
[1:17:59] many messages prepared shorter ones to
[1:18:02] go with translators and of course you're
[1:18:04] dealing with people that are not used to
[1:18:06] an hourlong message for sure um so even
[1:18:10] more condensed but almost every single
[1:18:13] place that I went to I felt to preach on
[1:18:15] the the book of Acts the
[1:18:18] pattern and preach the baptism of the
[1:18:21] Holy Ghost and the supernatural power of
[1:18:25] God Miracles gifts healing and gave my
[1:18:29] testimony about being healed from Co and
[1:18:31] some other Supernatural testimonies from
[1:18:34] my life and
[1:18:36] uh within that gave a very basic
[1:18:40] introduction of brother Branham and him
[1:18:43] being a prophet and then after service
[1:18:46] we prayed for the sick and handed out
[1:18:49] books of brother brandham we brought
[1:18:52] several thousand books we left all left
[1:18:55] them all with
[1:18:57] people and you see there you start to
[1:19:00] see some of the the the the way that
[1:19:02] they dress there in Upper Egypt it's so
[1:19:05] strange to to see them uh but
[1:19:10] incredibly sincere hungry people
[1:19:16] um you know on on on the one hand you'll
[1:19:20] see them they they're dressed like it's
[1:19:22] 1820 then they whip out their big old
[1:19:24] self cell phone and they're talking on
[1:19:25] it taking pictures of you you're like
[1:19:27] this is what planet am I on here I
[1:19:30] thought I went back in time and now I'm
[1:19:31] right back in the 21st
[1:19:39] century the first night I uh that we had
[1:19:42] a prayer line and everyone came through
[1:19:45] I think the entire church went through
[1:19:46] for prayer everyone made their request
[1:19:49] known by the time it was done I said if
[1:19:51] I do this nine more times I will
[1:19:53] literally die
[1:19:56] there's got to I've got to there's
[1:19:58] something else because they're all hard
[1:20:00] workers these are farming
[1:20:02] people they they Farm they work on their
[1:20:05] equipment which is not much usually
[1:20:08] their equipment is a donkey and a cart
[1:20:11] and they work on their homes so they
[1:20:13] every every every man comes forward has
[1:20:16] a bad back has an injured leg has a bad
[1:20:19] hip uh needy
[1:20:22] people see this very common young people
[1:20:26] old people with the turban and the long
[1:20:30] uh uh tunic or I don't know what you
[1:20:33] call it at the end the the pastor asked
[1:20:36] all the children to come forward to be
[1:20:40] prayed for and uh he testified
[1:20:42] afterwards he's like when when you were
[1:20:44] praying for the children I felt the
[1:20:47] power of God come come down into the
[1:20:49] service just so strong he began to weep
[1:20:56] and we we always brought we always
[1:20:58] grabbed somebody from the church to get
[1:20:59] the books out of the back of the van
[1:21:01] bring them in and then they distributed
[1:21:03] them for us after the service usually
[1:21:06] while we prayed for the
[1:21:08] sick say Pastor
[1:21:11] Sammy
[1:21:13] there was so enthusiastic really
[1:21:17] appreciate
[1:21:20] him and uh again you're going to have to
[1:21:23] go to Instagram and see my bumpy
[1:21:29] Drive the brothers that have gone to
[1:21:31] Africa already know know about that I
[1:21:34] was hearing stories from Brother Matt
[1:21:35] that brother Jason could just sleep
[1:21:37] through all of it no problem and I was
[1:21:39] thinking there's no there's not even a
[1:21:41] 1% chance that I could fall asleep my
[1:21:44] whole body my head my brain is rattling
[1:21:47] around in my my head and it's like at
[1:21:50] your brace just like this the whole time
[1:21:53] and if you're not you're just going to
[1:21:54] like
[1:21:56] this so God bless you brother Jason I
[1:21:59] want some of that to rub off on
[1:22:04] me this was one of the churches there
[1:22:07] when we drove up you could see from a
[1:22:09] long ways away that they had a really
[1:22:12] high steeple and it blew me away because
[1:22:14] I know that these are the men here that
[1:22:17] built that church and put that steeple
[1:22:20] 150 ft in the air it's just
[1:22:23] like and I'm sure they didn't do it with
[1:22:25] a lift lift and I'm sure they didn't
[1:22:28] even do it with a very good
[1:22:31] ladder and I I don't I'm horrible at
[1:22:35] estimating amounts but brother megaly
[1:22:37] thought there was 400 people in the
[1:22:40] church their men and
[1:22:47] women and you could see I asked brother
[1:22:49] megaly I said why are the some of the
[1:22:51] women sisters dressed like americ
[1:22:54] Americans and why are some of them
[1:22:55] dressed traditionally and he said well
[1:22:58] the ones that have money try to dress
[1:23:02] like dress
[1:23:08] like handing out books for us at the end
[1:23:10] of service this so struck me this man
[1:23:14] got the book and started read reading
[1:23:16] the front cover it's the one with the
[1:23:19] cloud uh picture of the cloud on it and
[1:23:21] he actually took it and he kissed the
[1:23:22] book and was just staring staring at it
[1:23:25] like he was so
[1:23:31] excited Pastor there at that
[1:23:35] church that was the Sunday morning
[1:23:38] service was at the previous church and
[1:23:40] then the Sunday evening uh this was the
[1:23:44] uh Chapel at the um at the orphanage so
[1:23:50] these are the orphans there's probably
[1:23:52] like 200 220 230 orphans
[1:23:57] there and like 100 staff or
[1:24:01] so the the uh orphanage is supported by
[1:24:06] Assemblies of God around the
[1:24:08] world um brother the reason why the door
[1:24:12] was open to us is they usually don't if
[1:24:14] you're not you know showing your
[1:24:17] Assemblies of God Fellowship car you
[1:24:18] ain't going to be going in there and
[1:24:19] ministering to the people but brother
[1:24:21] megal grew up there when he was a little
[1:24:25] boy um his when he when he was born his
[1:24:29] mom passed away and his father didn't
[1:24:32] know what to do with him and so a
[1:24:35] relative came his father basically in in
[1:24:38] uh in Upper Egypt the way they cook a
[1:24:40] lot of times is they have what we would
[1:24:42] think of as like a pizza oven it's a
[1:24:45] it's a big oven like this made out of
[1:24:47] clay and they have an opening so it's
[1:24:49] quite open he just put it he wasn't
[1:24:51] cooking but he just put his son in the
[1:24:52] oven and just left him there brother the
[1:24:54] megal and so a relative came over heard
[1:24:57] heard him crying and said there's just a
[1:25:01] there's just an orphanage down the road
[1:25:03] I'll take him there he said fine so
[1:25:05] brought him brought him there and he was
[1:25:07] raised there and uh met his wife and and
[1:25:10] got married and he actually hasn't been
[1:25:12] back he's in his 50s he hasn't been back
[1:25:14] since he was 19 years old when he left
[1:25:16] the orphanage so I had mentioned to him
[1:25:18] is there any way we could visit that
[1:25:20] Lilian Trasher orphanage and he he he
[1:25:23] made some calls and they said yeah
[1:25:25] because you grew up here the door is
[1:25:27] open to you and to your friend and so we
[1:25:30] came and I ministered to the kids about
[1:25:34] um fighting against depression and I
[1:25:37] told my testimony about being healed
[1:25:38] from covid and uh spent time
[1:25:43] fellowshipping with the the the chap
[1:25:45] their chaplain or their P the pastor of
[1:25:47] the the
[1:25:49] orphanage and uh they after I spoke they
[1:25:53] brought me up and gave me some books
[1:25:54] about Lilian Trasher and some little
[1:25:57] presents there and a picture with a
[1:26:01] description of of her life and testimony
[1:26:04] and about the orphanage gave out some
[1:26:07] candy to the
[1:26:09] kids but the uh I think I have a picture
[1:26:13] of myself with the chaplain see him it's
[1:26:16] just wonderful to be able to do that and
[1:26:20] give candy to all the kids and of course
[1:26:22] the staff was eager to get some American
[1:26:23] candy
[1:26:26] 2 um I don't have a picture of him but
[1:26:29] at the at the orphanage on on the Monday
[1:26:32] morning we woke up and uh they wanted me
[1:26:35] to come and have breakfast with the
[1:26:37] staff as we're walking into the
[1:26:39] breakfast he's like we're just we're
[1:26:41] going to have some devotions will you
[1:26:42] take like a half an hour to have a
[1:26:44] devotion and I was
[1:26:46] like
[1:26:49] sure that was a little quick but fine
[1:26:52] we'll do it and uh then they gave us a
[1:26:55] tour of the of there and they've got
[1:26:57] like um from babies all the way up to
[1:27:01] even 20-year-old um kids that are
[1:27:05] they're still training them for uh work
[1:27:07] and so forth but then beyond that is
[1:27:10] there's a lot of um orphan women that
[1:27:14] decided they would give their lives to
[1:27:17] taking care of the orphans just the same
[1:27:19] way lilan Trasher did and so then then
[1:27:22] there's a group of very very elderly
[1:27:25] women that live there and have to be
[1:27:27] taken care of by the orphanage they they
[1:27:30] take care of widows and orphans but
[1:27:32] these women are they were orphans and
[1:27:35] they never got married so they're quite
[1:27:37] old so blind there was blind women and
[1:27:40] there was you know very sick women the
[1:27:42] pastor took me each one to offer a word
[1:27:45] of encouragement and and and pray for
[1:27:47] them and it's a great experience but the
[1:27:50] he said he the door was open to us
[1:27:52] anytime we wanted to come he would he
[1:27:55] would be glad to have me come and
[1:27:57] Minister uh anytime there so that was a
[1:28:00] that was a blessing to have that open
[1:28:02] door we handed out books of brother
[1:28:04] brandham to all the kids there and all
[1:28:07] the staff and to the the um their their
[1:28:11] chaplain as well
[1:28:14] so see how that goes I wish I could have
[1:28:16] gotten a better picture of this but just
[1:28:19] passing him in the car this is uh uh
[1:28:24] he's on a he's on a donkey he's on a
[1:28:27] cart with that there and the there's a
[1:28:30] donkey carrying it this was typical I
[1:28:32] think when I was there they were
[1:28:35] harvesting uh their Clover to feed their
[1:28:38] animals for the year that was everywhere
[1:28:41] this kind of thing a lot of times it was
[1:28:43] women on had it on their heads carrying
[1:28:46] carrying these big giant stacks back to
[1:28:49] their homes from their
[1:28:51] fields before service night with some of
[1:28:54] the ministers the brother that's um
[1:28:57] sitting on my one side is brother Prince
[1:29:00] and I'll talk to him talk about him a
[1:29:02] little bit
[1:29:11] more packed out church this church
[1:29:13] doesn't have a p their Pastor just
[1:29:15] recently passed away so the the
[1:29:19] um the denominational leaders are sort
[1:29:22] of sending ministers through there to
[1:29:24] to watch over them but totally packed I
[1:29:27] mean you we tried to get off the
[1:29:29] platform it was almost impossible to get
[1:29:31] out of the
[1:29:34] place and we drove up a couple hours to
[1:29:37] the north to a city called magaga stayed
[1:29:40] there this is uh brother Prince and his
[1:29:44] wife they took care of us she made all
[1:29:46] of our meals while we were there in
[1:29:49] magaga and um he is the Secretary of
[1:29:53] their denomination so we sat with him in
[1:29:56] his church the Lord led me to speak on
[1:29:59] Joel 2 about the restoration of the
[1:30:02] Bride tree and and about the dangers of
[1:30:06] having the leadership of man over having
[1:30:09] the leadership of the holy spirit in the
[1:30:11] church and uh gave some of my testimony
[1:30:14] prayed for people handed out books and
[1:30:17] uh uh spoke a little bit about um
[1:30:20] introducing brother Branham and you know
[1:30:23] the 193 three the angel of the Lord
[1:30:26] appearing and saying as John the Baptist
[1:30:27] was sent to four on the first coming of
[1:30:29] Christ Etc went through that with him
[1:30:32] which he was shocked by because I was in
[1:30:34] taking a nap while I was taking a nap
[1:30:36] brother megaly was describing that to
[1:30:39] him in in in the uh apartment we're
[1:30:42] staying
[1:30:45] in I didn't want to embarrass her by
[1:30:48] showing the picture in case somehow she
[1:30:50] came across it but every time she came
[1:30:53] to our place they live we were we were
[1:30:55] staying in the apartment above their
[1:30:57] Church very common is there is they buy
[1:31:00] a building have the church on the ground
[1:31:03] floor or the second floor and then they
[1:31:05] make apartments for visiting ministers
[1:31:08] or guests to be able to stay in so
[1:31:10] that's what we stayed in they lived a
[1:31:12] few blocks away every time she wanted to
[1:31:14] feed us she would come with a big huge
[1:31:17] uh uh carrier on her head walking up the
[1:31:21] stairs just like this no no hands hands
[1:31:24] on it nothing just up and down the
[1:31:25] stairs like she'd been doing it her
[1:31:27] whole life which she
[1:31:30] had this was looking out the window
[1:31:33] across there there's chickens and so
[1:31:36] forth in that spot thankfully they
[1:31:38] weren't alloud uh that was like right
[1:31:41] outside my window bedroom
[1:31:44] window so that was the grace of the Lord
[1:31:47] and one day you know when I was there
[1:31:50] part part I forgot to mention was once
[1:31:54] passed a certain point uh in Egypt that
[1:31:56] you can't go there without if you're a
[1:31:58] western or without police escort so
[1:32:01] before I went brother megaly had to get
[1:32:03] a copy of my passport and discuss it
[1:32:06] with the police so everywhere I went I
[1:32:08] had an escort of police usually they
[1:32:10] would go in some decrepit old police
[1:32:13] truck that looked like it probably
[1:32:15] wouldn't run very much longer and uh
[1:32:18] they had at least four or five guys they
[1:32:20] had some people from the local christian
[1:32:22] militia that would go with and then um
[1:32:25] just then several regular police
[1:32:28] officers so I mean I was in in a way I
[1:32:30] was like felt like I was sort of under
[1:32:33] house arrest because I couldn't leave or
[1:32:34] go anywhere without asking the police um
[1:32:38] if we could do it so it was a little
[1:32:40] weird that way um but this particular
[1:32:43] day brother uh brother Prince has grown
[1:32:45] up here it's what's crazy is all these
[1:32:47] people that live here now I asked them
[1:32:50] like have you just moved here did your
[1:32:52] family no he said as far as we know all
[1:32:56] our all our ancestors have lived right
[1:32:59] here in this city in this town and he
[1:33:02] said it's the same for everybody all
[1:33:04] these families know each other for
[1:33:06] generations and generations and
[1:33:07] generations CU I was asking is it safe
[1:33:10] to walk through this this city before we
[1:33:12] go out and he laughed and said I know
[1:33:14] every I know everybody we've known
[1:33:16] everybody for Generations yeah this area
[1:33:18] is safe I know where if you go beyond
[1:33:20] this you're in a Muslim neighborhood and
[1:33:22] you're going to have problems but this
[1:33:23] is a Christ CHR
[1:33:24] neighborhood um so when you walk down
[1:33:27] the road you're going to definitely see
[1:33:29] a donkey or 10 and you're going to see
[1:33:32] cows and you're going to see water
[1:33:35] buffalo um this is with brother Prince
[1:33:39] and we walk down there I don't know if
[1:33:41] you anybody has heard of this but there
[1:33:43] is a canal there called Joseph's canal
[1:33:47] and I researched it and as far as they
[1:33:51] can tell it goes back it's been called
[1:33:54] Joseph's Canal as far as they know as
[1:33:56] long as they remember so it's more than
[1:33:59] likely was a construction project by
[1:34:04] Joseph many many thousand years ago and
[1:34:06] it's a it's a it's quite a big Canal
[1:34:09] there there's lot everywhere there's a
[1:34:11] canal cuz that's how they water their
[1:34:14] fields but this is like one a huge
[1:34:16] feeder that feeds from the Nile into a
[1:34:19] lake North from
[1:34:22] there this guy said I had to pay him $5
[1:34:25] to take that
[1:34:27] picture I
[1:34:31] didn't
[1:34:33] um little kid walked up and wanted a
[1:34:36] picture with me in the
[1:34:38] neighborhood as we were walking down the
[1:34:40] road it was it was so interesting an
[1:34:44] older um woman was an old grandma was
[1:34:48] sitting on their their front porch which
[1:34:51] there's not a porch it's just a brick
[1:34:54] but um she gets up and is like she's
[1:34:57] like pray for me so we just had a little
[1:34:59] prayer prayer meeting there in the in
[1:35:02] the street as we're walking down the
[1:35:05] road some water buffalo as you know
[1:35:08] everybody has a water
[1:35:11] buffalo if you don't get that then you
[1:35:13] never had
[1:35:19] kids
[1:35:22] Wheat they that's the main thing they
[1:35:24] grew was wheat in the
[1:35:28] fields it's the
[1:35:30] Nile I didn't make any denial jokes when
[1:35:33] I was
[1:35:37] there all right so this church we went
[1:35:41] to I was just amazed because on the
[1:35:44] bottom floor they're trying to get the
[1:35:45] church ready but um there that's a very
[1:35:49] poor group of people you can see on the
[1:35:52] floor it was covered in even on the
[1:35:54] second floor it's covered in dirt and
[1:35:56] even in the corners it was like there's
[1:35:58] like a dirt pile going up and um on the
[1:36:03] their their handrail going up the stairs
[1:36:05] and I'm I'm telling you they had very
[1:36:07] elderly people in this church the
[1:36:10] handrail was just rebar sticking out of
[1:36:12] the thing I thought this is this is a
[1:36:15] worst disaster I've ever seen but it's
[1:36:17] normal for them that's how they build
[1:36:18] they they start and if it's useful just
[1:36:21] use it
[1:36:29] this was for for me personally this was
[1:36:32] one of the
[1:36:33] most uh amazing trips mission trips I've
[1:36:36] ever done just to be there with these
[1:36:39] simple humble PE I mean look they got
[1:36:40] one light there that's their
[1:36:42] church one light above the preacher and
[1:36:45] when we got there it was dark and and we
[1:36:47] were like well I guess we're having
[1:36:48] Church in the dark I got it I got my I
[1:36:51] got my MacBook so that's all we're all
[1:36:53] good
[1:36:54] they'll see us lit up a little bit and
[1:36:57] um but then we prayed and the the the
[1:36:59] lights came on there in the
[1:37:03] area
[1:37:04] and just uh incredible I mean I think
[1:37:07] every everyone came for prayer after the
[1:37:09] service it's one of the ones I I just
[1:37:12] preached the gospel preached about the
[1:37:14] baptism of the Holy Ghost gave my
[1:37:16] testimony about being healed from Co
[1:37:18] everybody came for he for prayer for
[1:37:21] healing handed out
[1:37:24] like every other Church handed out books
[1:37:26] of brother
[1:37:37] brandham I think this is the church yeah
[1:37:40] this is Brother Prince's church so uh
[1:37:43] just few floors below where we were
[1:37:46] staying during the last half of the week
[1:37:48] there in
[1:37:49] Egypt
[1:37:51] and I had no idea but app ently this was
[1:37:54] Mother's Day so I'm like what in the
[1:37:55] world is it only women at church today
[1:37:58] why does this church have like three
[1:38:00] men and then I look out the Gated doors
[1:38:03] and I'm like why are all the men in the
[1:38:05] listening to me from the street and then
[1:38:08] like the next day brother megal was like
[1:38:10] yeah yesterday was Mother's Day I'm like
[1:38:13] what you didn't tell me I could
[1:38:16] encourage the ladies he's like well I
[1:38:19] just let you go on your
[1:38:22] normal talk
[1:38:24] all
[1:38:30] right this is the pastor of the church
[1:38:32] he wanted to take this picture of us in
[1:38:34] front of his new
[1:38:37] building he was hoping that I would
[1:38:40] bless them with some um something to
[1:38:43] build their building with
[1:38:55] same thing we at the end of this service
[1:38:57] I I had him stand up and I said how many
[1:39:00] are believers could lay hands on one
[1:39:02] another we did that and then as we're
[1:39:04] walking out we were detained and I pray
[1:39:06] I have I prayed for another hour for the
[1:39:09] people so amen that's fine the Lord
[1:39:14] knows selfies on the platform never
[1:39:18] experienced that before
[1:39:21] but it's something
[1:39:24] this was the last service we had there
[1:39:27] um in this area uh this was when the
[1:39:31] police truck finally did break
[1:39:35] down fortunately it was after
[1:39:37] service but
[1:39:40] um this one was neat because some of the
[1:39:44] guys from the Christian militia were
[1:39:47] there uh with their I I don't know if
[1:39:49] they came into church with their 22
[1:39:51] rifles but they were standing in the
[1:39:53] back listening and uh one of them came
[1:39:57] and asked for came into the prayer line
[1:40:00] we prayed
[1:40:16] for and I asked about the women why
[1:40:20] they're dressing with those the head
[1:40:23] cover ings and everything and I was
[1:40:26] fascinated to realize is this is how
[1:40:27] Christians have dressed in Egypt
[1:40:31] for 1900 years since since the gospel
[1:40:35] went there this is how they've dressed
[1:40:38] and so that's the traditional um style
[1:40:43] and um they've just stayed with it most
[1:40:45] of these people were born
[1:40:48] Coptic uh Christians Coptic is is any
[1:40:53] familiar with Coptic that's another form
[1:40:56] of Catholic so
[1:40:59] when year you know back in at
[1:41:03] NAA uh they split up three uh four
[1:41:06] different Patriarchs of the church one
[1:41:08] was Rome the pope one was Alexandria
[1:41:13] Egypt one was
[1:41:17] uh let's see in
[1:41:19] Syria
[1:41:21] Antioch um and and there was another one
[1:41:26] which was escaping my mind at the moment
[1:41:30] but these four Patriarchs and one of
[1:41:32] them was in Egypt so as the churches
[1:41:35] separated especially if you saw the
[1:41:37] Eastern churches separate from the the
[1:41:40] RO the Roman Church this is one of the
[1:41:43] churches that was kind of original
[1:41:47] Catholic there they still have their
[1:41:49] patriarch but he's now in Cairo
[1:41:54] and so they're very very um Mary is very
[1:41:58] important and even some of the people
[1:42:00] that came to Services after you pray for
[1:42:02] them they do the sign of the cross or
[1:42:04] whatever and so I I talked with a number
[1:42:08] of the pastors and asked about that and
[1:42:09] they said we it takes time I said these
[1:42:12] people this is what their Generations
[1:42:14] have come up up up under and we're
[1:42:17] working with them the other thing that
[1:42:18] complicates it is that it's
[1:42:21] Egypt there's no such thing as fre of
[1:42:23] religion so if you come out and blast
[1:42:26] the pope of alexand of of
[1:42:30] Cairo you probably will never come back
[1:42:33] to Egypt because they control they have
[1:42:35] control with the Muslims over the Visa
[1:42:39] process and all that so if you're going
[1:42:41] to speak like that you speak directly to
[1:42:44] the ministers the Pastors in public
[1:42:46] you're going to have you're G to have
[1:42:48] Catholics listening to you right there
[1:42:51] who are Poli in the police who won't
[1:42:53] hesitate to arrest you so um wisdom is
[1:42:57] required of what you say and how you say
[1:43:00] it how you speak about denominations
[1:43:02] and you
[1:43:04] know um if if you if you have a feeling
[1:43:07] that you want to never go back to Egypt
[1:43:10] again let her let her go but if you have
[1:43:13] a feeling you want to reach the people
[1:43:15] then you speak privately to those who
[1:43:18] are more uh mature so amen men musicians
[1:43:24] would you
[1:43:26] come I think that's the end of them a
[1:43:29] few
[1:43:36] more so there's the there's the man that
[1:43:38] came with his 22
[1:43:42] rifle uh to be prayed for didn't have
[1:43:46] Hearing in one of his
[1:43:47] ears and so this was he was he became my
[1:43:52] escort back to the
[1:43:54] vehicle so the the Lord has really
[1:43:57] opened a door a as we were one of the
[1:43:59] last days we were there brother Prince
[1:44:01] spoke with me and said we really
[1:44:02] appreciate your ministry coming here to
[1:44:04] minister to the people we believe you're
[1:44:06] a man of God um we we so appreciate what
[1:44:11] you're preaching and this was the
[1:44:14] statement that caught me off guard and
[1:44:16] was surprised about he said Do You
[1:44:17] Preach like the old time Pentecostal
[1:44:21] preachers about Miracles and the baptism
[1:44:24] of the Holy Ghost and he said we don't
[1:44:26] hear that kind of preaching very often
[1:44:30] anymore and
[1:44:31] so uh we we discussed with him about the
[1:44:35] books that we had because we did have
[1:44:37] some left and he said oh no please leave
[1:44:40] them I'm going to go visit many other
[1:44:41] churches and and they'll want these
[1:44:43] books as well so I'll distribute them
[1:44:46] and I said well you know if you want
[1:44:48] more we can get you more he said please
[1:44:50] we want we want more of the sermons of
[1:44:52] brother brandom to be able to distribute
[1:44:55] so we're going to do that and we're
[1:44:57] we're we're working
[1:44:58] on a plan at some point to get back to
[1:45:02] hold a ministers conference there's 65
[1:45:05] ministers there and I'm planting a seed
[1:45:07] with brother
[1:45:11] Jason just it's just a seed you know
[1:45:14] we'll see if it grows takes root to uh
[1:45:17] help out with a a ministers meeting
[1:45:20] amongst the the ministers there it's a
[1:45:22] it's a incredible opportunity I'm I'm
[1:45:25] still actually dumbfounded by it to be
[1:45:27] honest with you um that they were very
[1:45:30] aware of what the teaching is I mean I I
[1:45:33] handed to all their ministers
[1:45:36] um the the the new book that I did about
[1:45:40] uh introducing the message and talks
[1:45:42] about godhead serpent seed water baptism
[1:45:46] modesty and
[1:45:48] introducing the the message and the
[1:45:50] scriptures fulfilled through brother
[1:45:51] brandham and and they were very
[1:45:53] enthusiastic about all of it it's been
[1:45:54] translated into Arabic already so
[1:45:57] they're very they're very receptive
[1:46:00] desirous and at the end he said I I read
[1:46:03] these I read your books that you did
[1:46:05] that that have been translated into
[1:46:06] Arabic he's like they're really good I
[1:46:09] believe what you're talking about amen
[1:46:11] and uh so we'll see what happens
[1:46:14] committed into the Lord's hands you you
[1:46:16] water you you plant the seed and the
[1:46:19] Lord is the only one that can make it
