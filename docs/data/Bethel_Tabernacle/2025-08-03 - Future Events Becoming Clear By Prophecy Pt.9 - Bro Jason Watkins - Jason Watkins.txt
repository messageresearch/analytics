[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Morning everyone. God bless you. Let's go ahead and stand as we go to the scriptures. Be continuing on the subject of the life of Christ. And I know depending on how you say that, some people might think we're doing a expository preaching on the four gospels or that we're speaking about a doctrine, but we're speaking about the character of Christ. &gt;&gt; That's what our focus on this is. And the first scripture we're looking at is in Romans chapter 12 and verse 9. Let love be without dissimulation. Abhore that which is evil. Cleave to that which is good. Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love in honor preferring one another. Let's pray. Father, we ask ask that you be with us, Lord. That you take your word and write it upon the tablets of our hearts, Lord, because we know that is that's what you're doing in this hour, Lord. It's you're you're causing us to come and eat your word and then become that word and then speak that word, Lord. So, we pray, Father, that you would mold us and shape us into the image of Jesus Christ. We commit this time to you for your glory. We ask it in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you. You can be seated. So, we'll do just a little review from last time looking at the four loves. This verse uh these two verses bring out three of those loves. So, let love or let agape be without dissimulation. So, not fake, not falsified, uh not something that's a put on, but let it be genuine. Let it be sincere. Um and and then the next verse it says be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love. The word kindly uh affectioned is the word philos and it's it is speaking of a friendship but also of a a family love. And you see that that the translators translated stoay as affection. So that's that's a part of stoay family love. And then it says brotherly love which is the word we're all familiar with Philadelphia. So again this is speaking of of friendship, affection, and agape love. And there's another type and these are all three of the words for love used in the Greek New Testament. But there's another one that's kind of outside the Bible which they talk about aeros love or erotic love and that's that's a different kind. Uh we refer to it in different ways. Sometimes we speak it about uh in our modern culture falling in love. It is it's a temporary love. It's a love that's out for self pleasing and self-satisfaction. It's it's more it's it's a form of love but it is not the real and genuine love. Falling in love is a actually a process where we we in many ways go backwards um as far as in our development and in our mentality because we lose sight of the bigger picture and we're so uh infatuated with this this person that we love in front of us that we lose sight of things that are important and we thank God we have other people in our lives that can sometimes wake us up from the from the stuper of falling in love. It's a human. It is a human love. It's a selfish selfish self-centered love. If all your marital love is only aeros, you will have a miserable life because you're being governed by that. And that's what the world is. They think that falling in love, aos is love. &gt;&gt; And because of that, they're they're they're breaking up and finding a new one. And you it is it is something that happens in the human condition. I believe it's part of what God has designed for us to propagate the human race. But it isn't based on logic. It isn't based on wisdom. And it isn't based on the word of God. And that's the thing in maturity. We understand that we go through es and flows even in our marriage. There's times where uh the feelings are high and there's times when the feelings are low. real love re understands that and can operate in that agape love wanting the best and spiritual growth for the person that you care about the most in the world. So another part that we see about this is in Greek they go to such detail about love we can see and understand you know they have four different ways that you translate it the same word love love love in English you know and I'll even go into that we say we love Pepsi or we love Coke we love Starbucks we love this we love that and it's we don't actually love it we enjoy that &gt;&gt; Amen Real love is something different than what we feel about Starbucks or or sorry, brother Ken, Urban Brew. And so we use these terms and we use these things very very loosely so frequently. And I'm not trying to get everybody to change their mind on how they speak, but realize what we're saying and what we're thinking and what we're looking at helps us to understand. And so when we look at these different kinds of love, agape, filelio, sto aeros, we understand that love is ordered. There's different orders for love. And I'll get into this in more detail probably in the the next Sunday school. But if I if I were to love uh my neighbor's wife the same way I love my wife, something's disordered. Amen. &gt;&gt; Something's dysfunctional. Something's wrong. &gt;&gt; If I were to love another person's children more than I love my own children, &gt;&gt; something's out of order. Something's wrong. Because that I have a duty, right? Where's my first duty? To God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right? Regardless of what happens around me, my first duty is to God. But then as a husband, I have another duty. And if I properly love my family, I will order myself and my life in that way. You know, even even to ministry or whatever it is, I can't put that first before my own family because then I disqualify myself for ministry. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we see that, we've seen that many times over the years. We see that in the Pentecostal church, charismatic church of today is they they put their ministry and their their their image first before they put their family. And you see they're divorced and remarried and they got kids here and kids there and it's just chaos. God's love is ordered. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Properly. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. I think we'll just and just to go into brother you'll you'll if you search agapo in the table you'll see this brother Brandham says felio is human love right and so you have three different kinds of human loves and and the interesting thing is even if you look at the stature of a perfect man one of the one of the loves that we're to progress into and grow in our faith is Philadelphia so even though that's a human love God wants us to grow in maturity and in wisdom and in understanding in felio love. And so even in those human loves, you you if they're ordered correctly with agape love permeate per permeating them and over basically uh uh being the foundation but also the overriding force that's behind the human loves then there even those three loves human loves are an expression of of God right but without God involved in these human loves. Any person, the the most evil person can express a form of these human loves. &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. And when they become when they become disordered, that's the place where they become a demon. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's love, but it's actually a demonic form of love. But because why why would it become a demonic? How can love be demonic? Is when it it is governing you above the word of God. &gt;&gt; Agape love doesn't lay aside the word of God. Never does. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we'll see that as we read 1 Corinthians 13. But without agape love overseeing and managing Felio sto aeros, these loves when they reach their pinnacle become a demon. &gt;&gt; And human loves all contain a kernel of divine love. But without proper governing over them, they are perverted. It becomes corrupted. And so you know we see this writer says love begins to be a demon the the moment he begins to be a god. And so especially we look at romantic love and it becomes the every the romantic love becomes the governing force behind people the driving force behind lovers. &gt;&gt; Yeah. What ends up happening is they they will sacrifice everything that's sane and good for the sake of this quote unquote love. But in fact, it isn't love. And when we look at it, when it's sacrificing everything that's true and right for the sake of this love, it actually it isn't love. It's an advanced form of hatred. We speak about it as love, but it's actually hate. and the the the the def the working definition of what love is based upon our modern society. Like I mentioned before, you you you drive down the road in Minneapolis, not too long, you're going to see signs on churches and signs in in uh people's yards saying love is love. Okay. What do you mean by that? Do homosexuals uh having erotic love between each other? Love is love. It it is not. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We cannot we can't as as people with brains inside of our heads, I won't even say as Christians, people with brains inside of our heads that can look at things logically can see that not all quote unquote love using the English term is love. Sometimes it's flatout evil. We read this at the end of the service last week. This is brother Brandham from the Smeirian church age. He says, "You see, they could not figure out God's love. They thought that love meant no suffering. They thought that love meant a baby with parental care. But God said that his love was elective love. The proof of his love is election. that no matter what happened, his love was proven truly by the fact that they were chosen unto salvation because God hath chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth. He may commit you to death as he did Paul. He may commit you to suffering as he did Job. That is his prerogative. He is sovereign. But it is all with a purpose. So what is with a purpose? His love is with a purpose. If he did not have a purpose, then he would be the author of frustration and not of peace. His purpose is what is his purp what is the purpose of his elective love? It's that after we've suffered a while, we would be made perfect, be established, strengthened, and settled. As Job said, he put strength in us. You see, he himself suffered. He learned obedience by the things that he suffered. Though he were Hebrews 5:8-9, though he were a son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered. And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him. In plain language, the very character of Jesus was perfected by suffering. And according to Paul, he has left his church a measure of suffering that they too by their faith in God while suffering for him would come to a place of perfection. So looking at this and and understanding what God's love is, we understand that it's ordered. We understand that it's also for a purpose. &gt;&gt; And so they people the denominational world thinks think love means you won't have any problems. Everything will be good and easy. But in fact, that if if we're in a condition that God doesn't want us to be in, and God allows things just to be simple and easy for us, not to challenge us to grow, then it isn't love at all. But in fact, God's elective love has a function and a purpose behind it. When God's love is what puts us into situations that are difficult, that are painful, that try us, why why does he do that? So that we would grow spiritually. So that the inside of our being would turn turn from being a reflection of this world and be become a reflection of Christ. So God's love is a power or force that extends itself for the purpose of your spiritual growth. And so if we can understand that, that's God's love. So we need to have that love as the Bible says shed abroad in our hearts. In fact, in our human flesh, we're unable to perform agape. But when God, it's it's go God is love. And that the love of God is shed in our brought in our hearts by the Holy Ghost. That's when we can be an expression of that love. What is an expression of that love? It's a power. It's a force that you extend yourself for the purpose of other people's spiritual growth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So if God's elect, again, I'm going to repeat it. It bears repeating. Elective love, he's chosen you. Doesn't mean life is easy. In fact, actually, if we understood it right, it means the opposite. It means that because we're in this fallen flesh, this sexorn nature that we have, &gt;&gt; what ends up happening is God's going to say, "That's I don't accept that. I don't accept you leaving you in this condition. I accept you as you are, but because I accept you as you are and I love you, I'm going to change you and make you like Jesus Christ." because that is that is the pattern and that is the aim that he has for every seed of God that he had in his mind before the foundation of the world. So what what is he going to do? He's going to allow us to go through things that are difficult that are hard in order that we might grow up into him who is the head in all things. Brother Brandham, uh, skip here. And hear ye him. Brother Brandham says, "Men and women, hear me today as your brother. Let all your little isms and your little sensations drop. Find the love of God. I'd rather have his love than every gift that he's got in his kingdom. Give me his love." That's what the world is looking for today is to see a display of real love. It'll win souls. When you got love, they can call tell it when you got love. We got too much makebelieve love. We got too much love. Felio love trying to make it agapeoa love. We need a real godly love. &gt;&gt; And from that time, brother Brandham says, "Let me tell you a little secret. The most powerful force in the world isn't speaking with tongues or interpreting tongues or being honored by God to be a minister or to be evangelist or to be a prophet. The most powerful weapon that I've ever found in my life is love. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; So, think about that is you may be a prophet. You may have a prophetic gift. You may have an anointing to preach the word. You may speak with tongues. You may interpret tongues. Whatever gift you might have, but but the most powerful force behind that gift isn't the gift. It should be love behind the gift. And that's what Paul in 1 Corinthians 12:13 and 14. That's what Paul is the point that Paul is trying to make is we we you're operating. Okay, Corinthians, you love it. You love operating the gifts. You're excited about it. You're zealous for it. But what is the motive behind it? You're trying to be seen. You're trying to have a position. You're trying to have place. You want your image to be right instead of realizing that it has to be the most powerful weapon that God has, which is love. That's what changes people's lives. That's what transforms people. That's what makes ministry effective is when it's done with the emotive and objective behind it of love for others. &gt;&gt; What is love for others? We just said it. A power force that extends itself for the purpose of spiritual growth. That's what love is. And so that needs to be our motive and objective behind what we do. Continue reading. The filio love, which the Greek word comes from friendship like you have for your wife. There's a difference. It'll make a mother for that baby run through a blazing fire. Her life means nothing. That's filelio. What will agapeo do? See the godly love. We must love. Divinely love one another. Then you don't see your brother's mistake. If he does make a mistake, you never you look over the top of it and you love him anyhow. See, that's it. Love those that love you. But does not the sinner the same thing? But love those who doesn't love you? That's what shows the spirit of God is in you. Cuz he loved you when you were his enemy and he loved you. And if that spirit's in you, it'll make you love your enemy as you do your friend. Amen. And again, remember how we defined love. Don't get it out of order. Don't get it wrong. And we'll talk about this later, but it isn't a feeling. It's an action. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a purpose. It's extending yourself for a purpose for that other person. All right. 1 Corinthians 13, the great chapter about love. I'm going to we'll read through the scriptures and then I want to present it in a little uh different way. So, charity suffereth long. Of course, this is the word agape. And is kind. Charity envieth not. Charity vaunteth not itself. is not puffed up, doth not behave itself unseemly, seeks not her own, is not easily provoked, thinkketh no evil, rejoicth not in iniquity, but rejoices in the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. And so when I when I was looking at this, I was thinking, okay, so there's two different portions to this. There's what love is, and there's what love is not. So, I thought, you know, being a teacher the way I am is I want to put this all into a uh a little page to show what love is and what love is not. Love is patient. Love is kind. Love bears. Love believes. Love hopes. Right? Love endures. Amen. &gt;&gt; Love is rejoicing in the truth. And so when we look at this is what love is. This is the this is a lot more than a feeling. &gt;&gt; Feeling might come after it but this is this is what love does. &gt;&gt; This is this is the action that love has. In America in western culture we say we love people. Usually we mean we have a feeling towards them. &gt;&gt; That's not agape love. &gt;&gt; That's most of the time at best. That's stoay. That's affection. It's not even really friendship. It's just affection. We have a feeling towards a person. That's fine. That's good. No problem with that. But to be governed by that is not the Christian life. That's not the life of Christ. It's good to have sto. It's good to have Filelio. It's good to have aeros if it's directed correctly to your wife &gt;&gt; or to your husband, but that is that isn't the life of Christ yet. Love is patient. I mean, the these are all things that's coming against resistance and trouble and difficulty. You have to bear all things. In other words, there's someone that's annoying you, someone that's frustrating, a cert situation that makes you up that would normally make you upset and maybe does make you upset. And you become angry, but you sin not. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you say, "Okay, I'm bearing with this person. They they need to grow like I need to grow." &gt;&gt; Love hopes all things. Hope is speaks of an earnest expectation. So, it looks at a person and says, "Man, they're messed up, but I'm going to pray and I'm going to do my best to help them. And I believe I believe and I have hope, earnest expectation that God is going to change them just like he changed me." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because I was a mess and sometimes I am a mess. Right. Right. &gt;&gt; All of these things don't have It's great to say love is &gt;&gt; when everything is easy &gt;&gt; and everybody's nice to you and we're living in the Garden of Eden condition, &gt;&gt; but this is not how love becomes manifested. This is every one of these things. You have to be patient. It's not hard to be patient that's some on someone that's waiting on your every need and hands you something before it ever comes before you ever want it. That's not patience. Patience is when someone's trying your patience. Someone's trying you. Someone's being frustrating and difficult. Rejoicing in the truth that would have no impact if there were not lies out there. If there was not dishonesty endures, that would have no meaning if there weren't suffering. &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Love is not envious. Love is not boastful. Love is not arrogant. Love is not rude. Love does not insist on its own way. Now, that doesn't mean it's a pushover or a jellyfish. What love insists on is God's way, not its own way, not my will. The Lord's will be done. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Irritable. Love is not irritable or resentful. Love does not is not rejoicing in evil. &gt;&gt; So we see what love is and what love is not. And it's manifested in a fallen world amongst fallen people of whom we are one of them. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And so, so this is this is God's love ultimately. And then when that love comes down into us, it's not native to the sinful nature. Filelio, Aeros, Sto, they're all native. You can all, even unbelievers and pagans can manifest on some level all of those types of love. But agape love is different. Agape love is coming down from above and only though only as a uh secondary manifestation can we put it on display because it's God operating through fallen &gt;&gt; man. Amen. &gt;&gt; Redeemed flesh. Let's put it that way. So in closing, true agape love is not a feeling. You don't fall into agape love. &gt;&gt; You you actually it rises up from within. It's not a falling. It's a rising up from within by the spirit of God that lives within you. It's a choice. It's not a falling. It's a choice. Love is only love if it's freely given. Just as God freely gives his love to us, we need to be able to free freely give our love to others. Agape love is an action that permeates and transcends all our human loves or it needs to if our human loves are to be ordered properly. It needs to permeate all of our human loves. It's also not a manufacturing of love. A sheep is not asked to manufacture wool. &gt;&gt; A sheep just does it automatically. It's something that comes forth from that sheep. And it's supposed it's the same thing with love. It should be something that's coming out of our innermost being as a fruit of the spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. because it is a fruit of the spirit not something that we have to force oursel or work ourself into but that it by the holy spirit comes out of us un towards others that's actually the force and the power of god as we said the most powerful force is agape love so that is actually the power of god coming forth from our lives to extend itself for the purpose of other people growing spiritually I would say even not even the right hand knows that the left hand is doing it. How does that work? How do I do something as though my right hand doesn't know my left hand is doing it? In other words, it has to be something that's automatically coming out of me. Hey, I didn't know what happened. I don't know how I did that. Just the Lord did it. If you think about the cases of of divine love coming forth from brother Brandham towards those animals, it's something that just came out of him by the power of the spirit of God. Not even the right hand knew that the left hand was doing it. Romans 8:28. And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose. So the called according to his purpose are the ones that have elective love placed upon them. And therefore we see that God is working in everything in their life for their good. What is our good? Our comfort? No. For our eternal good. &gt;&gt; So so God's love is expressed in the form that it causes us to grow up into the maturity of the word which is Christ. And as we as I am connecting this to love, Romans 8:35, who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword? No, none of those things separate us from the love of Christ. In fact, in the midst of them, the love of Christ is manifested because he uses tribulation, distress, persecution, famine, nakedness, peril, and sword in order to cause us to grow up into Christ. &gt;&gt; And so, that is God's love and that is agape love. That's the love that we need to have towards one another. not a manufactured put on, &gt;&gt; but something that's coming from the depths of our heart and reaching out to others and saying, "I want to see them grow in Christ. I want to see them walk with the Lord. I want to see them changed and transformed. And I'm hoping and believing and enduring and being kind and not being rude and not being resentful and irritable. Why? Because I have to do it?" No, because something on the inside is pushing me &gt;&gt; for it. I'm bearing wool, not manufacturing it. Let's pray. Heavenly Father, we thank you so much for your word. We pray, Father, that you would, oh God, extend your love into our hearts, Lord, and through our hearts, Father. We commit ourselves in this time and the worship and the preaching of the word to you, Lord. Be glorified in our midst. We ask in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you, saints. [Music]
