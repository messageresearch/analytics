and and his church and all of you that are connected to the ministry of the End Time Gospel Hallelujah let's just bow our heads amen and we'll get right into the word of God I hope you are in need of God talking to you tonight amen if you have a need why don't you just lift your hands to the Lord amen if there's an unspoken request let's just pray Lord Lord Jesus father we love you Lord and and Lord as the song said we just want to pour Our Praise out Lord Lord for all the great things you've done Lord all the things that you will do and father it's been said Lord if you never do anything else you've done enough Lord and Lord God you're so great and so mighty Lord it said if if all the things you've done Lord were recorded the books would be able to to contain it Lord so father just shows how great you are Lord L and Lord you see the hands that are lifted Lord but most of all you know the need and desire there and father just mold us Lord to not want or crave anything that's not of your perfect will Lord and we pray that you would bless the service tonight Lord and father as you've always you've you've already allowed us to create an atmosphere Lord of worship now Lord God let the word come forth with power and demonstration Lord for we know that that's the gospel preach lord it's more than just letter but it's something that we can apply it application to our lives Lord Lord we can take what we hear and we can go back and live it Lord Lord and we just pray that the Holy Spirit would dominate the service Lord you dominate each and every individual Lord forgive us for Lord the areas in our lives Lord that no one sees but you father that stenching your nostrils Lord keep your blood atoning in our lives in Jesus name we pray the church say amen amen if you have your Bibles let's go to um um St John chapter 17 St John 17 and uh let's start reading at verse 20 praise the Lord St John 17 and verse 20 if you haven't say amen the Bible says neither pray I for these alone that for their for for them also which Shall Believe on me through their word that they all may be one as thou father are in me and I in thee that they also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou has sent me and the glory which thou givest me I give I have given them that they may be one even as we are even as we are one i in them and thou in me that they may be made perfect in one and that the world may know that thou has sent me and has loved them as thou has loved me amen May Lord a bless reading of his word you can have your seats by the grace of God oh my I want to read uh one more verse of scripture um in Ephesians chapter 4 just to keep going with that channel right there Ephesians chap 4:4 it says there is one body and one Spirit even as ye are called in one hope of your calling one Lord One Faith one baptism one God and Father of all who is above all and through all and in you all amen you know by the grace of God I want to use for a subject one God one people amen one God one people and you know Church uh as we look around there are a lot of churches all over the place there are a lot of different doctrines and denominations and a lot of people proclaiming to be the people of God but at the same time everybody is saying they serve that one God Amen and tonight I I believe that we're we're we're further alone trying to describe that there's just one God we should believe that amen we that that should even be a a question in our mind that there is one God but I think the the greatest question we have to answer is the one people amen and you know I uh the only way I I can see answering that is how you respond to the word of God because God is in his word and God is his word amen and you know uh uh the Bible says in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was made flesh so no matter which dispensation you put it in the beginning the coming and now here it's still that same one God and you know if and and if you can see yourself being the people of that one God you have to be able to see yourself identified with him in the beginning amen you have to be able to see yourself identified with him coming Hallelujah but most of all you have to be able to see yourself identified in the now Hallelujah that that same one God is here right now amen and you know if I could just go uh to Genesis 1 you know familiar verse of scripture let's just look at it church just one God and just one people amen now we believe uh that our God is one God you know in the in the Old Testament they call him Jehovah and God Almighty and as the revelation of God unfolded it came into the uh uh uh the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you know know uh different churches or different teachings try to separate those two Hallelujah but we know that there's one amen one God hallelujah but when we look at that one God and we look at what he did and as he created God created the heavens and the Earth and all these things and even in Genesis 1 and verse uh 26 the Bible says uh and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness Hallelujah now you take those words right there let us make man in our image after our likeness now it look like there's there's more than one entity there that's what it looks like but we know God to be one amen hallelujah so I'm not going to go on and on into that but you know you think about he said let us make man in our image in our likeness now uh I'm just going to hit it maybe brother Jason or brother mat can come back down and and give you the teachings of it but we know when God was saying us he was talking to that which pertained to him amen because there was nothing else that could make something in his image in that moment Hallelujah the only thing that existed the only thing that created was God and I'll say right now the only one that was speaking was God hallelujah nobody else could talk in that moment because the Bible the the the word of God said that God be to speak and he begin to say Let There be uh there was nobody else saying let there be God was the only one Hallelujah and now that same God was going to create Hallelujah a people amen or should I say a person Hallelujah but this person being created was in the very image and likeness of God oh my I'm trying not to go there but I got to go there man Hallelujah the image and likeness of God and we know that God was eternal Hallelujah so in that person was eternity yes oh I got to help you out a little bit okay praise God I don't mind helping that's what I do I'm I'm here to help Hallelujah I was created to help the church now you uh uh the word of God has been preaching this church so much you should know your part already Hallelujah you should know Hallelujah that there's something in you that agrees with the word and when you agree with it there's something that comes out of you that sounds like this Hallelujah and you know Church Hallelujah that that that God him all by himself he was eternal and he said let us create men in our image and likeness so eternity was in those people hallelujah in His image in his likeness and his greatness amen the power of the spoken word was in those people hallelujah and as God begin to condescend the different Hallelujah the different stages of God begin to unveil as God became Hallelujah self-existing Elohim self-existing power of God is in those people hallelujah you don't need alcohol you don't need drugs you don't need the things of the world why because God is self-existing amen you don't need help from Tylenol help from all this other medicine and all the why because God is self-existing amen he already put that inside of you you don't need help from anything else but God you can't separate God from his people hallelujah that's the whole just of my message Hallelujah you what we've done through all these years and we put God over here and we put the people over here if we could just see what God sees if you could just look in the mirror and see what God sees Hallelujah that's already there in you that's already there Hallelujah according to what God created from the beginning amen hallelujah and as God created he talked and the another stage of God was the logos which was creative power that also is in his people the power to create is in the bride of Christ oh see let's make it personal in the family of God Amen oh hallelujah oh my yeah we say bride over here church over here bride over here I like the word family Hallelujah family of God hallelujah to have a family amen that there has to be some kind of conception there there has to be some kind of Kindred or connection there Hallelujah and God had to fertilize your life with the word of God so that you could come forth as what word beings hallelujah we're not coming we're not coming forth as Church gos hallelujah we're coming forth as word beings because who is God God is the word and you cannot separate me from the word why because we are a part of God so as you grow and as you hear the word what do you become the word I shouldn't say become because you're already it hallelujah what God is trying to do is to get you back in that thought process the right thought process you know it's like having a child and that when that child is is is is Young and is a little baby that child really doesn't understand who you are to a certain extent they know that you're mother or your father but they don't know the depths of your love yet W hallelujah oh my they don't know how much of a protector you are Hallelujah they don't know that you'll give your own life just so they oh my you give your whole life just so that they can have have life how many times we've heard of mothers lifting up cars or snatching kids out of the road why so they could be protected amen Church where did that come from where does protection come from it didn't come from the devil Hallelujah protection comes from God that's already in his people hallelujah W Hallelujah and as God came down he began to condescend and the different uh stages of God came down and then God spoke and he said let us make man Hallelujah in our image and our likeness anything else he created before that he never uttered those words but you were so special when God created you he wanted to see himself oh my and if that one ain't good enough for you I got it written in blood blood I'm going get you to come along one way or another Hallelujah but church when when we look at the start the start of and don't get nervous I'm about to close as we look at the start of we think about God and his people you know God has given us various scriptures to identify that we are him who yes a part of him but when you really really get the Revelation you are him cuz look I can't separate my head from my body and say it's living no if something happens to my hand it's a part of my body I want every Limb and everything working like it's supposed to why because it's a part of who I am Hallelujah my hand has a purpose in the body Hallelujah most of us have 10 toes I thought everybody going to say Amen on that one some of you got a little problem huh Hallelujah most of us have 10 toes why you cut one of those toes off it will affect your balance so God has given you things in your life in your body Hallelujah for balance amen and he's given us a word hallelujah a word that came Hallelujah in our day to do what bring back the balance in his house bring back the balance to his family amen the worst thing you can see is a family that's unbalance but God hallelujah sent the prophet why did he sent the prophet he said behold I see you because of you that's the only only reason oh my church look at it the only reason God came out of hiding come on the only reason he came out of hiding was because of you oh my he wanted you to know that you are his child and better yet more than just his child you are a part of him but in our day we in our time where we are right now we should be living a little bit higher than just saying I'm a part of God CU my hand is a part of me but there are certain things it has to do it has to do amen yeah I could put my face down in a plate and eat like the no but it'll be so much easier with my hands Hallelujah because my hands are there what to feed the body amen see there's perp there's purpose in this church there's purpose in every individual here why because you are a part of of the body Hallelujah and God created man in His image and in his likeness nothing else did he create like that there are things that he created that's a type of God hallelujah but we are more than just a type we are the real deal I want you to catch it church every Church age up to now was just a shadow of God that's right Hallelujah it was a shadow of what's the come but in our day so much was revealed to let us know who we are we're no longer living in the shadows we can step out there like Jesus said when you see me you see the father Hallelujah well let's go look God has been throwing us hints in the scripture Hallelujah he says in Colossians 1 he says to whom God would make known what is the richest of his glory to the to this mystery among the Gentiles there is a mystery of God's glory Among Us and you'll never understand it until you start seeing yourself like God sees you he says uh the glory of his mystery among the Gentiles which is now he's going to tell what the mystery is according to the scripture here is your hint and the Mystery is hallelujah Christ in you the hope of glory now if Christ is in me that must mean I am Christ now I know that this is this is a a little hard to swallow but I'm not talking as a person taking God's Place per se but what I'm saying church is that God has put attributes of himself in us hallelujah God has put the natures and characteristics of himself in us hallelujah so there are times in our lives when things happen where we will reflect who's in us hallelujah and it comes out in a trial it comes out Hallelujah in Tribulation the mystery of how we keep going what is it Christ in you which gives us hope amen yes sir Hallelujah that's why you just saying I'm a Baptist is not good enough Christ is not identified with that anymore there's more of him that's been unveiled hallelujah or even I'm in the message hallelujah amen that has to be more than just a statement it has to become a literal living being look he says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God the beginning word the word was with God and then it says and the Word was God so the beginning was a word and that beginning in that word was God so I want you to understand that your beginning was God yeah hallu W Hallelujah glory and if God gave you his own life your beginning Hallelujah has no beginning if you was with God and the Word was God Hallelujah the beginning and the Word was all God and if you was there you have the same characteristics as who God if we if we just take a natural point of view for a second Hallelujah my daughter Kier is here with me tonight that's my travel buddy she normally goes with me everywhere I go if she can and you know church if you look at her deep enough you'll see some of my characteristics as much as she might not like that there's a reflection of a father in her oh W Hallelujah there's Natures that will just come out that belong to me that are in her why it's passed down through the bloodline Hallelujah and better yet it's a part of her DNA that comes from me Hallelujah now that was already in me but then it transformed Hallelujah it transformed to her when she was born so I want you to understand when there is a birth there is a transfer or DNA hallelujah hallelujah DNA nature characteristics Hallelujah the way you look all the things that comes from that father begins to be injected in another cycle of life but as that life begins to live and it grows Hallelujah the your father will just begin to come out whether you like it or not there's certain strands there's certain grains Hallelujah of me that in her hallelujah oh my I got brown eyes she got brown don't you got brown eyes yeah I think so H Hallelujah Glory where does that come from it comes from the father Hallelujah but look God giving us hints and he says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with god wow and then we drop on down and we read a little bit more and it says and the word became flesh it dwelt among us and it became flesh so in this room there's something dwelling among us hallelujah not us as the individual but the revealing of our father Hallelujah if we just keep looking at scripture amen the different things that God has done hallelujah it says hallelujah in mark it says and they look at this now church after Christ left he will still sing Hallelujah how many know that just because God left the scene that doesn't mean he wasn't still there that's right and I give you one Hallelujah the prophet of God say after he leaves a city he says the angel of the Lord may stay behind for weeks dealing with the people why is God having communion with his creation God loves you so much his whole job his whole Destiny his whole purpose is to get you back how he originally created you that's all he's trying to do Hallelujah is get us back to what Genesis 1:26 to where there's no more fear in your spirit there's no more doubt in your spirit Hallelujah there's no more sin that's attracting your eyes before sin Hallelujah Adam looked at God Adam talked to God Adam was in his presence Adam wasn't confused by his voice amen it was one God one people Hallelujah he says and they went forth and preaching everywhere the Lord working with them I want you to understand something tonight he said the Lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following and after that following you know what comes by that following that was kind of weak Hallelujah after God sent them forth with the word showing them who they are are it says that he went with them so they were not all alone they were not by themselves God was there confirming that this is my family these are my people this is my son this is my daughter and I'm going to confirm their life hallelujah oh my listen Church you cannot separate God from his people look at what the scripture says now Paul Paul was a man who was chosen of God but God had to bring him to a place that is more than you just knowing good teaching because he had good teaching in his life he was raised up Hallelujah under the under the toolers ship of CIA amen one of the strongest old testate teachers but God wanted to come and show Paul there is more of me to be revealed and when God knocked him off his high horse he said who are thy Lord he said I am Jesus Hallelujah and from that point something came alive in Paul it was always there but it took a knockdown it took a a blindness amen it took God knocking him off his high horse just to open up his understanding and sometimes that's what trials hallelujah what was that message broken but broken but not bitter Hallelujah I hope y'all still go back and feed on these messages because God be saying things Hallelujah that will loose us God be saying things that'll help us put one foot in front of the other Hallelujah but look Church look listen what Paul said after he got converted now I want you to understand this what I keep saying one God one people he said I want them to be one like we We Are One in them and one in us hallelujah so whenever you see it all you're going to see is one amen remember Hallelujah in Acts the 4th chapter amen the disciples went out Healing The Sick and raising the dead and they said these people must have been with Jesus they saw one God hallelujah they begin to ask John the Baptist they say John who are you are you the Messiah they saw one God they saw John doing things that only God should be to do amen and John wasn't doing Mighty Miracles John was just preaching under the authority that God gave him but I love the statement that Paul makes in Romans the eighth chapter he says who shall separate us from the love of Christ I want you to understand this there's nothing in this world that can separate you from the love of Christ nothing let's go back and read it Romans the 8th chapter Romans 8 Romans 8 and 35 the Bible says who shall separate us from the love of Christ shell tribulation now you your part in that is to say no unless you believe otherwise Hallelujah shall tribulation no or distress persecution famine and we see a lot of nakedness no Hallelujah Peril sword none of these things can separate us from the love of God hallelujah oh my church and as we look at the scriptures one thing I want you to catch look I want to read you something the prophet of God said he said then see God came down and the character of God was Christ now I'm going to throw you another hint what I'm trying to do is get us all to live up to the standard of what's in us hallelujah G read that again then see God came down and the character of God was in Christ all that was in the father he poured into Christ all that was in Christ he poured into somebody say me so if he put the character in Jesus and then Jesus took that same character and where is it now in US you should see Hallelujah God's character the stature of a perfect man flowing out of you it should be a full development by now Hallelujah he said he was the reflection oh my Christ was the reflection of God the Father amen so if he poured all that into the church all that into the bride all that into you and I who are we we should be the reflection of Christ God looking back over the banister at Adam again saying oh I can rest cuz I see my image and my likeness why did God rest because there was nothing missing out of Adam's life Wow Adam was complete Oh my he was a complete son Hallelujah he said in the beginning was God he was even God then no God hallelujah is an object of worship only thing he was was eternal Hallelujah and in him was attributes and those attributes were thoughts and those thoughts was expressed now we know that we are part of God's thoughts but I'm more than just his thought I am the expression you are the expression amen because Church what is it it's no good in God's mind God was the thing about God is he loves to speak we don't have a God that sits by the side no he loves to speak so we're more than just the thought of God we are the expression of God one God one people I'mma weigh you out with us now Hallelujah listen he said we his attributes we his thoughts the thoughts was expressed to words and the words was made manifest so when you think of the thoughts being expressed even the expression go Hallelujah into something even more solid that you can put your finger on it and say I know this is God because they say it started up here as his mind then God be to speak in it and Hallelujah and it was expressed and as it was expressed it began to do something Hallelujah and as it be to do what it did it was manifesting the character of God it was manifesting the person of God see I challenge you Church Hallelujah a lot of times we preach uh people say give me something deep give me something I never heard before and then we get in these channels Hallelujah and it seems like sometimes people are lost in the atmosphere you know why because you don't study the message don't rely on the fivefold ministry to give it to you you got to spend time with God Amen hallelujah amen this is not a developmental program hallelujah we're not here to develop you we are not reformers hallelujah we're here to preach the word so that you may be quickened Hallelujah Made Alive you know when something is quickened you say man W hallelujah it's me think about sister Hallelujah when that man got down on his knee and said I want to marry you oh my something came alive inside of you I ain't getting no amens from the sisters got to tighten up Brothers you got to do a little bit more Hallelujah church when you when she or he realized that they were the one Hallelujah something begin to move inside Hallelujah all the if if it if it was something true everybody else Hallelujah that may have had an interest was shut off hallu every other phone number was erased or should I say an hour day Hallelujah every other DM Hallelujah every DM every person on social media that may have had interest interest when that person that you were longing Hallelujah to be with made up their mind and say I've chosen you it did something to you on the inside Church think about that God hallelujah God let the devil have us first don't you realize that you know why because he had all confidence in what he put inside of you he knew alcohol wasn't going to stop it from coming forth he knew a promiscuous life wasn't going to stop it from coming forth he knew drugs wasn't going to stop him from coming forth he knew the entertainment Hallelujah of the 2000s wasn't going to stop him from coming forward he knew Hollywood couldn't stop it Hallelujah he was confident he is confident that what he put inside of you will reflect who he is that's why he put you in the midst of Satan eatting and stand back just like he did in Jo's day and say watch this amen he's confident look in the beginning was God and he was he wasn't even God de he was the object of worship only thing that he was was eternal and in him was his attributes and those attributes were thoughts and those thoughts were expressed to words and the words were made manifest now this is what I like right here what is it what is it all what what is it it's all God to get you here where you are in this time hallelujah it's been all along all God you say well I move from Ohio oh God I move from Florida all God I move from Minnesota oh God I move from Tennessee oh god oh you come from it's been God hallelujah putting you in position you say well I met this real I met this person it's been all God it's been God directing his people amen Church you may not know Hallelujah but even even brother Jason or other preachers have had opportunities to do other things but it's been all God they say no I want you to do this why because I have Hallelujah some people for you to feed amen Church there's always been a level of sacrifice for God to come out in his fullness hallelujah look he said it's been all God becoming tangible to get you where you are are I want you to catch this can everybody see Matt stand up man stand up to get you where you are it's been all God becom in tangible what is tangible being able to put your hand on it being able to touch it and see it and know what it is now we know that's matad right Hallelujah he right there in that moment he's tangible if anybody want to come touch him all you got to do is come up these stairs and touch you if he'll let you Hallelujah but he's right here in our midst he's tangible he's no longer a mystery right Hallelujah some of you may have had a thought to say I wonder if Matt's coming to church tonight he's here in the flesh we can put that thought to rest and what we've been doing we've been traveling we've been going about our life wondering if God is with us church he promised I'll never leave you nor forsake you Hallelujah church he has become tangible Jes thank you man he's become tangible we shouldn't be wondering if God is with us he's with us how could we go without him it's been all God Chris it's been all God Amen oh my what I always say you know we all go through trials and tribulations and things and Hallelujah you know I was coming down the road and I felt the quicker and power God talking to me and you know I just start to go back in my life and look at all the great things God has done I met I met a guy a guy I used to work with back in 200 six somewhere in there from 1998 to 2006 right before God started dealing with me by going full-time in the ministry and I was working at the city which was a good job had three weeks vacation I was making good money I had sick time all that stuff but then something start to flow up in me about giving God more than just a 10-hour shift on a job and God start dealing with me about going full-time in the ministry and and you know we all can see I'm there amen and I've been there for so many years now by God's grace but Church it took something for me to get there but it was like what God will do sometimes he'll push you just to let you know he's there because what is faith faith is walking without control hallelujah hallelujah it don't take no faith for me to come down these steps and and just run back here it don't take no faith to do that that just take a little bit of balance but you know what'll take some faith for me to get on the top of these pews right here JD and jump from this one to this one to this one and this one to this one to this one and I guarantee if I do that I have everybody attention in here as long as my walk looks normal we don't even pay it attention but let me do something I ain't supposed to do then it's extraordinary then it catches our attention attention but the mistake we're making Hallelujah God is hidden and revealed in what simplicity so your ordinary walk with God hallelujah is something powerful Hallelujah listen he said and he he said is all God becoming tangible and you are a part of God and Jesus come to redeem those that was put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world it was in God's thoughts and that's what he come to redeem and them as soon as it strikes Hallelujah to them see something has to take place in that walk of Faith where you realize you are different Hallelujah see Abraham got to a place to where he realized he was different Hallelujah and once he realized he was different he stopped living in fear he stopped trying to control things and he just walked by faith and as he walked Hallelujah it was God walking with him and becoming tangible Hallelujah think about the church even his fear Hallelujah God introduced himself to somebody because of Abraham when the king went and took Sarah Hallelujah he probably wasn't even a part of the promise which he wasn't but when Abraham got out of Step God had to make himself known and there are things in your life Hallelujah that make it out of step and then the tangible God will come and make himself known whether it be in your child's life the direction they're going or on your job or whatever it may be God will come and make himself tangible oh my listen he said to them as soon as it strikes they see it because the life is in there I'm going hit this and then I'm going jump out the way Hallelujah why are we living this message why are we in this message it's simple because there's something inside of us that identifies with it am Hallelujah I like I like to make this I like to make this parallel most of us in here were born after 65 [Music] some of you stal in the fence a little bit but if we look around most of us the voice of the Prophet was gone I mean the the physical physical part is gone Hallelujah we couldn't go we can't go there and sit in the services or follow where he's going to be we couldn't do none of that Hallelujah but you know what Billy Graham was still here yeah In the Flesh still going around preaching still holding Services why didn't we connect with that because there was nothing in us that could agree Hallelujah as far as a body change and then you know who else was here or Roberts was here also both of the Angels were there were still here hallelujah why didn't we connect with him Hallelujah because there was something Hallelujah about us where we needed more that's right but then let's look at God and how strategic he is church just the voice on Magnetic Tape brought us to an Awakening Hallelujah I want to show you how powerful that is not going to a service not being in a tent meeting not traveling up to Jeffersonville just hearing the V what are you saying brother JS you've heard that voice before not the voice of the man but the voice of the word and there's something inside of you that when you heard that Voice Hallelujah preaching the word something came alive what was it it was that one God connecting with that one people because a lot of other people heard that voice but they didn't hear God wow that's how special you are church do you realize there are people in Jeff that have never even heard of the Prophet but I can travel thousands of thousands JD travel thousands and thousands miles into foreign lands people listening to that voice what is it it is a chosen people that's right a people that were destined Hallelujah to connect with what one God not the god of denomination not the God of this world but the God of this word the god of Eternity the god of Deliverance the god of healing the god of Salvation the god of the Holy Ghost amen amen you were destined to connect and once you connect what was it it was one being one again hallelujah hallelujah not one being two it was one being one because that's the way God originally created Hallelujah he created man to be what one yeah and and the prophet of God say Eve didn't wait Hallelujah because her children were going to be what spoken word children and I'm here to say hallelujah we are here to do what Eve couldn't do we raising children Hallelujah in the spoken word and they are becoming who they are how by what they hear he said if eveve would have just waited she would have been able to speak her children into existence by the spoken word what are we doing what are we doing brother Don no matter how it look we just keep speaking the word hallelujah and if you are one people with that one God as you speak Hallelujah everything around you will begin to pay attention who's talking Hallelujah that's why you ought not to give up yeah a lot of times we give up and we just go because we don't realize who we are remember you're not alone you're not by yourself amen the scripture says I'm g go back and read it the scripture says there is one body and one Spirit Hallelujah even as ye are called in one hope of your calling one Lord One Faith one baptism hallelujah look look I'm going to jump way out there on the limb and shock you guys Hallelujah the Holy Ghost Paul had is the same Holy Ghost I got sir Hallelujah the say what did that Holy Ghost do Hallelujah that Holy Ghost he walk with a certain Authority he said Grievous woles will come after I'm gone you know why because they know who I am when they see me they see the father Hallelujah that's what the Holy Ghost does the Holy Ghost brings you back into standard of who you really are oh my and you see the different disciples and different ones after the Holy Ghost came their life was changed that same Holy Ghost Peter had is the same Holy Ghost we got Hallelujah and we know Peter like to fight it'll stop you from fighting Peter like to cuss it'll stop you from cussing still letting it slip a little bit huh one God one people oh my let me wind this down brother de what are you saying listen you you know what this is of course you do mostly everybody in here got one a cell phone this is a uh Galaxy I I was waiting on it I was waiting on it if if you want to go there the prophet said that we are astronauts [Applause] I can't find them for an apple but a curse so I'd rather be identified with the message this ain't no Doctrine now I was just waiting on it thank you brother Jason Hallelujah but we know this a Samsung creation and their name is on it so their name reflects who created it hallah but you take Samson when you see this you don't see the Creator yeah you just see his thoughts Hallelujah and those that piggyback office thoughts the same thing with apple you think about Steve Jobs but you don't see Steve you think about Mac computers and all these things every creation you think about Ford Motor Company you see the Ford but you don't see Henry himself you take Chevrolet or whatever it is Toyota what whatever it is you see what was created but you don't see the person God is the only one that could create something and then live in it my you may have Michelin tires but you don't see Michelin himself Hallelujah you may see Good Year tires but you don't see Hallelujah the creator of Good Year you just see what was on their mind Church who we are we are the manifestation of what was on God's mind we're more than just his thoughts we are the real deal Hallelujah cuz you can build a computer Hallelujah but the person building can't control it and show his whole person and character and everything coming out of that computer God made a man and then he show the whole world what that man should be doing Hallelujah listen as we prepare to try to close listen what what does it take just what it takes now remember my thought one God one people when you leave out of the service I don't want you to look at yourself as separate from God because that's not how God created it when God saw Adam what did he see himself he was so happy with what he created he went to Adam and he put the rest of Creation in Adam's hands he said I want you to name it I want you to tell it what to do tell her where to go I leave it all to you Adam and all of that was good as long as Adam knew he was one with God but when fear and sin came in and Adam couldn't think like that anymore Hallelujah he lost the ability to operate in those channels but the channels were still there and God in his grace he made sure we had a way back listen he says now the first man and first woman in the garden of eaten was in a perfect harmony with God so much that God could come down at any time he desired to talk lip to ear with Adam and Eve what will get us there at church Perfect Harmony One Lord One Faith one baptism what is that Perfect Harmony what'll happen if we have Perfect Harmony in here tonight oh with our thoughts of who we are and our imperfections and all these things didn't exist in our minds what if we got to a place where we just we sitting in our seat Hallelujah you sitting right there aing and you say I know God is my father I know Hallelujah that God is here and we all as one people hallelujah find that one channel of that one God and produce a perfect harmony what will it do it'll bring us back to eaten now that is perfect Oneness God in his creation God speaking lip to ear with Adam and Eve and they were in perfect harmony with god Till They Were one with God God and his family was one see he never put it a God and them no God and his family won Hallelujah when you go on a family vacation most of the times uh everybody go together the father don't just send his family down there and then he say he coming no normally everybody goes together Hallelujah listen he says that's God's purpose and his purpose as father Supreme was to be one with his family Hallelujah Earthly family Adam and Eve and the only way that they could be one with the family or with God was because God's nature was in them Hallelujah so we have a promise of Perfect Harmony and relationship with God is because the same nature of him is in you I know that's a little heavy to swallow but I want everybody do like this we're more than just church gos I've been preaching on fundamentalism fundamental church with Pentecostal Faith that's what I've been preaching on but tonight God wanted me to kind of go this way but I'll drop a little a snippet in there we're happy with being fundamental there's nothing wrong with being fundamental but what good is your fundamentalism with no faith that's it'll make the word of no effect you have all the doctrine you have all the law the dos and don'ts all that stuff fundamental but when Jesus come when Jesus came what do they do they call him a devil but they were fundamental Hallelujah the prophet say you couldn't put a finger on their lives but when the opening of the word came they couldn't receive it why because the word heard was not mixed with faith that's and this message is no good if it's not mixed with Holy Ghost Faith that's what Pentecost faith is it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah remember the prophet of God said Cain was fundamental he wasn't an unbeliever he was a Believer but he couldn't allow himself to open up to the regions of Faith he wanted to control his worship unlike his brother Hallelujah Abel was able to open up to the regions of faith and God took him into spaces that hadn't even been revealed yet on Earth so let's not just be fundamental people let's be fundamental people with Pentecostal Faith Hallelujah because he said one is like having a checkbook Hallelujah with no money in the bank he said the other is like having money in the bank with no checkbook and then he says if I could ever get those two together we should be in the blend already we should be fundamental with Pentecostal Faith H and he says if I can ever get those two together it'll bring the Millennium oh my everybody all right don't get nervous he said oh with God or was God God's nature was in them so that made them with God's nature in them remember he said I'm not only going to just be with you but I'll be in you how many of us are looking for that amen Church you know something happened to me one day this week I had to go take care of some business do some things but it was just you know it was just pressing me before I get my day started pray about it so I did prayed about it and I just asked God to leave me to the right places Church in just that prayer God begin to open this door direct me over here to this person who I may have thought had the answer and they didn't have it so they told me to go to this person and this person say okay yeah I take care of this but if you need this go to this person God was just directing that's what we want to be we want to be in perfect harmony with God I hope your goal on this Earth wasn't just to find a good Christian wife or a good Christian husband it got to be more than that because there'll be when you get tired of that person don't say it too loud bro oh my listen as I prepare the cloth but it becomes a real revelation of God that you see it before it happens and and express it in word form the word takes a hold and becomes material a thought expressed see we are the material Hallelujah because we heard it we received it and now we're seeing it as it happens Hallelujah he said my how God could see it your heart your mind is so and filled with God's spirit until your thoughts be his thoughts amen there you are when your mind and your leading and your guiding becomes a direct place or direct inspiration of the Holy Spirit that's moving your mortal being not you and God just God what kind of people should we be if the very Holy Spirit has you so embodied or empowered that you don't use your own thoughts see he's already given us a hint the scripture says let this mind be in you don't use your mind use his mind it's all God hallelujah Paul say it's no longer I but Christ that liveth in me he you don't use your own thoughts you don't use your own mind you don't use your own opinions but the Holy Spirit has you so built unto your thoughts and your being is God's spirit expressing itself through you what kind of church would we be come on musicians I'm closing one God one people I want to challenge you tonight if you come to church and there's nothing stirring in you there's another Spirit pulling on you there's another power drawing you out so you don't hear this and be quickened and what that spirit will do that spirit will try to kill steal and destroy you and you may have heard these things all the time Hallelujah you know what happened to young people they look at their unsaved family members and they think they having a ball but you don't see them at night when they in the bed maybe think about how they going to kill theyel or you don't see them when they bouncing from job to job and wondering how they going to survive all these other things it looks real good on the outside and I'm saying to you if you Hallelujah if there's nothing in you stirring you need to get on your knees that's right and say Lord anybody be what God wants to be but just don't be nobody Hallelujah you want to be one with God hallelujah because we're finding and we're seeing so many people are going on to be with the Lord the courses are being finished the courses are moving on I don't know about you but I want to know Hallelujah I want to make sure that I'll be there by the grace of God hallelujah I'll tell you a testimony I was in Arizona a couple weeks ago and you know I was just kind of looking at my life and you know and I think it's good sometimes to examine yourself you know when I was examining myself and but just be careful don't examine Yourself by the trials you going through examine Yourself by what God has done in my mistake I was examining Myself by the battle Hallelujah like man boy this is tough this is hard to battle you know I got to I got to get to this I got to get to that you know the battle and I was looking at my testimony how God healed me from cancer all those years ago and like the devil was saying that's all you got which God and I know God has done more Hallelujah remember we made that video let me tell you a spirit of depression had came and the enemy wanted me to call you and tell you let's take that video down let's take that video down and redo it with something else and in a moment when I was thinking that a sister sent me a a clip of a service I was preaching somewhere and I was talking about my testimony and she went to the com comment and she highlighted somebody in the comments said I thank God for this testimony cuz I was just diagnosed with cancer what if my feelings would have gotten way out of Miss God that's why it's so important to be in perfect harmony with him and even in that God wouldn't finish with me God want to show it's not you it's been all me Hallelujah I walked out of a church when I was in Phoenix a brother came to me he said Hey Brother DS he showed me picture of me praying with his wife I didn't even remember it he showed me a picture of me praying with his wife he said hey you were praying that we have a child doctor said it was impossible we've been trying to have a child for eight years they say a tws were all crossed up tied up all kind of ways he said but we prayed that night here's the picture but what I want to show you is here go a baby a year later the baby came Hallelujah don't get in God's way let's get in Harmony in that same service another brother came out and he said Hey Brother DS have you ever met my wife and I was like yeah I think so and she couldn't hardly speak good English but she said he said hey she found your testimony online he said honey how did you find it she said I don't know she didn't even know how she found it but hallu what was it it was God directing Hallelujah because she had got diagnosed with a Cy on her brain Hallelujah but then she heard my testimony and she said she went to bed that night believing if God healed him he can heal me H not even knowing me not even met me she just got the testimony and she went to sleep and in the middle of the night she was awakened with singing in her room she looked at her phone her phone was off everything else was off and God begin to show her that these are angels in your room worshiping [Music] and I'll say this if angels are present worshiping that's because God is there because their whole job is to give God glory if angels are here tonight God is [Music] here church so she entered into the worship she went back to the doctor and the sis of her brain was gone Hallelujah church God can do these without a prayer line nobody laid hands on her was no prayer line Hallelujah she just believed what happened she got in perfect harmony with God and God touched the situation what about you tonight if you just get in perfect [Music] harmony let's [Music] pray Hallelujah let's sing a little bit of that before we before we pray surely by [Music] gra he became me

off of the organ and then the doo off of the mandolin I said you be tun in one after the other and eventually to get it wrong but what you need is you need a tuning fork you need one absolute come on somebody you need one absolute and I'm so glad God sent one absolute amen and that's real Unity it isn't that we always agree on everything and everybody agrees but friends I believe that Oneness brother Brandon I love how brother digs preached that out of the message he's quote not a Oneness and brother bandham said that that was the prayer of Jesus in John 17711 he said father this is my prayer that they may be one even as I and you are one and then the prophet took it further than I say well brother Matt it's good we're all one with Jesus but we don't have to be one with each other brother brandham says go further in that prayer that they'd be one with each other and then the prophet says that's the church that Jesus has coming coming back for a church one one with another and brother bam says and when he comes that'll be the the answer to that prayer that Jesus prayed how many just desire that amen how many desire that say Lord I want to be one one with your word one with
