[3:02] good morning everyone let's stand
[3:07] let's pray heavenly father we just come
[3:09] before you and ask you look take your
[3:11] word lord and
[3:12] speak it to our hearts i pray that you'd
[3:14] help me to get myself out of the way
[3:16] lord that you would speak
[3:18] to your people lord be glorified we ask
[3:21] these things in jesus name
[3:23] amen amen let's read that scripture
[3:26] exodus 24
[3:29] 16 and 17 and the glory of the lord
[3:32] abode upon mount sinai
[3:34] and the cloud covered it six days and
[3:37] the seventh day he called unto moses out
[3:39] of the midst of the cloud
[3:41] and the sight of the glory of the lord
[3:43] was like devouring fire on the top of
[3:45] the mount
[3:46] in the eyes of the children of israel
[3:49] may the lord have the blessing of the
[3:50] reading of his word he could be seated
[3:53] so if you recall
[4:00] the picture of the cloud that appeared
[4:02] in the mysterious cloud
[4:04] that appeared in the magazine it was
[4:07] february 28th
[4:09] and so we know that the the smiths
[4:13] brother george and sister rebecca did
[4:15] the research and
[4:17] found that brother branham was not there
[4:20] he was in houston february 28th he was
[4:22] not there in the arizona desert
[4:25] and so everyone went
[4:28] we're freaking out over here because
[4:31] there's a problem but the reality is
[4:32] there is no problem
[4:35] the reality is that brother branham did
[4:37] say it was a few days before and a few
[4:39] days after and if you follow along how
[4:41] brother branham
[4:42] talks he says a feud a few
[4:45] a few years ago it was 25
[4:48] years ago so he he is a man that lives
[4:53] in different dimensions and time is
[4:56] somehow a little cloudy and murky
[5:00] to him so but he says a few days before
[5:02] a few days after
[5:04] well if we look at it with specificity
[5:10] think he was hunting march 7th
[5:13] okay so that is
[5:16] in our western way of looking at it
[5:18] that's seven days
[5:20] after the cloud appeared all right
[5:25] but that's not how days were counted in
[5:27] the bible if you remember
[5:29] jesus was to be three days and three
[5:31] nights the jewish mindset is
[5:34] even a part of the day counts as a full
[5:36] day and they called it three days and
[5:38] three nights
[5:39] you can look at that in the book of
[5:40] esther they spoke that way then
[5:43] they did in the way in the time of jesus
[5:45] so you count
[5:47] friday one saturday talking about jesus
[5:50] friday one saturday two sunday three
[5:53] that's three days in the jewish or
[5:56] middle eastern way
[5:58] of reckoning it's it's it's funny it's
[6:00] the same
[6:01] it's it's different in in the united
[6:04] states when you
[6:05] want to say you're on the first floor
[6:08] that's like the ground level right and
[6:11] the second floor that's
[6:14] the first level in you go overseas and
[6:17] it's like
[6:18] zero which is the ground level one
[6:22] first floor second floor and it goes
[6:24] like that we count it differently so i'm
[6:26] we're confused so then we go to the
[6:28] bible and read it that way and we're
[6:30] confused
[6:31] so here we see mount sinai
[6:34] god comes down on the mountain
[6:37] and six days he abides on the mountain
[6:42] and then on the seventh day he speaks to
[6:44] his servant
[6:46] all right but
[6:49] when he wants to come and bring the
[6:52] opening of the seven seals
[6:54] it isn't seven days it's actually eight
[6:57] days
[6:58] if you count from february 28th the way
[7:00] the jewish mind counts
[7:02] to march 7th it's eight days
[7:05] which makes perfect sense because this
[7:07] is this is
[7:09] forwarding us into
[7:12] a new dispensation no not an eighth
[7:15] church age
[7:16] it's putting us into that eternal word
[7:19] of god
[7:20] not it's the bride age but it's not an
[7:22] eighth age
[7:24] right it's into that new world that new
[7:27] life just how brother branham talks
[7:28] about
[7:29] in the
[7:32] heavenly heavenly home of the
[7:35] earthly bride right
[7:39] so we thank the lord for these things
[7:42] eight days later
[7:43] the cloud comes down eight days later
[7:45] god speaks to his servant
[7:47] showing there's something it's a new
[7:50] creation
[7:51] it's a it's a new phase of redemption
[7:55] for the bride it's not a confusion
[7:59] the world wants it to be confusion right
[8:03] the devil wants it to be confusion but
[8:05] to the bride it's a beautiful
[8:10] revelation
[8:13] let's look at the next slide i think i
[8:16] control it here
[8:18] uh let us want to look at some
[8:22] different quotes about the seven
[8:25] thunders
[8:27] i think the last time i did this was on
[8:28] a wednesday night
[8:30] and i just wanted to continue on now
[8:33] even even though this is sunday school
[8:37] but looking at the seven thunders and i
[8:40] mentioned it before
[8:42] that because of people's past history
[8:47] in the around the message there's like a
[8:50] ptsd that happens
[8:52] and it can be it can be any any topic
[8:57] it can be your pastor your husband
[8:59] spiritually speaking
[9:01] uh or i mean
[9:04] a number of things where people have
[9:05] been hurt and damaged by
[9:08] a certain thing in the message and
[9:09] because of that they sort of create a
[9:12] wall
[9:12] around that topic and it's like we just
[9:15] don't go there
[9:17] and it's a great danger because god has
[9:19] something there it's not like it's not
[9:22] like
[9:24] brother branham avoided the topic
[9:27] you know even when he says it's a
[9:28] mystery it won't be it won't be known
[9:30] until a later time
[9:31] absolutely but then he goes on to
[9:34] explain what that means
[9:36] and so it shouldn't be a taboo topic
[9:39] it's actually something that's supposed
[9:40] to
[9:41] raise our faith up higher
[9:44] not damage our faith damage the way
[9:47] we're looking at it
[9:50] if it damages our understanding then let
[9:52] it damage our understanding and
[9:54] and be corrected to look at it the way
[9:57] god looks at it and i think some of the
[9:59] times people are so
[10:01] scared this guy's talking about seven
[10:03] thunders he's bringing a new
[10:05] revelation uh
[10:08] not bringing a new revelation looking at
[10:10] what brother branham said
[10:12] and want to understand exactly what he
[10:14] said in the context of scripture
[10:18] and i'm not even bringing you something
[10:19] different than what your pastor's
[10:21] already preaching we're just looking and
[10:23] reviewing
[10:24] this topic so
[10:28] this is in super sign 1962 long before
[10:32] he preaches the seals
[10:35] what not a year but nine months i guess
[10:39] let us work lord for we know we haven't
[10:42] much more time to work
[10:43] we see time closing in soon we're
[10:45] looking for the angel that will set his
[10:47] foot on the land
[10:49] and on the sea and raise up his hand and
[10:51] swear by him that lives forever and ever
[10:53] time shall be no more said at that time
[10:56] the mystery of god
[10:57] should be finished we understand now
[11:00] father
[11:01] that's god's threefold mystery has been
[11:04] made known to us and we understand and
[11:06] we're looking now
[11:07] for those seven mysterious thunders that
[11:09] came out from heaven
[11:11] in the book of revelation that was
[11:13] sealed on the back side of the book
[11:16] so 1962 we're waiting and looking for
[11:19] the seven thunders
[11:20] so god had already placed something in
[11:22] his heart we're seeing what god is doing
[11:24] right now
[11:25] there must be a seven thunder mystery
[11:28] coming forth to be revealed
[11:37] you go on to the next one for me all
[11:40] right
[11:42] so standing in the gap this is a year
[11:44] later
[11:47] so after the seals have been broken and
[11:50] then we got over in the bible and showed
[11:51] that there would be a seventh angel's
[11:53] message
[11:54] and at the sounding of the seventh
[11:56] angel's message all the mysteries
[11:58] of god would be made known then come
[12:01] seven mysterious thunders
[12:04] all right let's keep going
[12:08] thunders are to bring us rapturing faith
[12:11] and then there's
[12:11] this is in the first seal and then
[12:14] there's coming forth seven mysterious
[12:16] thunders that's not even written at all
[12:18] that's right
[12:19] and i believe that through those seven
[12:21] thunders will be revealed in the last
[12:23] days
[12:24] in order to get the bride together for
[12:26] rapturing faith
[12:28] because what we got right now we
[12:29] wouldn't be able to do it there's
[12:31] something we got to step
[12:32] farther we can't have enough faith for
[12:36] divine healing hardly
[12:38] we've got to have enough faith to be
[12:39] changed in a moment
[12:41] and we swept up out of this earth and
[12:43] we'll find that after a while the lord
[12:45] willing
[12:46] find where it's written i like that it's
[12:48] not written at all and we're going to
[12:50] find where it's written
[12:52] sounds like you're talking in riddles
[12:53] yeah that's how god
[12:55] does all right
[12:58] you're not going to be able to read that
[13:00] bless your heart if you can
[13:03] and i remember when he swept down there
[13:04] in that big light standing yonder at the
[13:06] bottom of the river this is in
[13:09] this is in the morning before
[13:12] he preaches
[13:15] is this the sign of the answers so again
[13:18] this is the morning
[13:20] before that so he already has had the
[13:22] vision he knows what's coming
[13:25] so this is what he's speaking and i
[13:27] remember when he swept down there
[13:29] in that big light standing gander at the
[13:31] bottom of the river in 1933 in june when
[13:33] he said
[13:34] as john the baptist was sent forth and
[13:36] forerunned the first coming of christ
[13:38] i send you with the message to the world
[13:40] to forerun the second coming of christ
[13:44] and i want you to notice his language
[13:45] and around around the world she's went
[13:48] she who the message
[13:52] when revival fires had been built for 15
[13:55] years on nearly every mountain
[13:57] divine healing across the nations and
[13:59] the power and restoration
[14:01] and now i believe she again she
[14:04] the message she is ready to strike that
[14:08] final climax yonder to bring forth a
[14:11] faith that will rapture the church
[14:13] into glory so in other words the message
[14:16] is going to go into a cl
[14:17] is going to reach a climax this is
[14:19] before he
[14:21] brings out is this the sign of the
[14:22] answers he knows what's coming
[14:24] he knows that he's going to get a
[14:26] revelation about the seven seals
[14:29] maybe doesn't know every detail about it
[14:31] at that point in time for sure he
[14:33] doesn't
[14:34] but he's saying some things i'm trying
[14:36] to let you know
[14:37] there's a final climax to what that's
[14:40] coming
[14:41] the message amen final climaxy honor to
[14:45] bring
[14:46] forth a faith that will rapture the
[14:48] church into glory
[14:50] and she is laying in the messages in
[14:52] other words
[14:53] a foundation is being put forward a
[14:56] foundation
[14:56] of messages that he's preaching is being
[15:00] put forward so that the climax
[15:03] can come and we're really at the end
[15:07] time we've talked about it and
[15:08] everything but the thing has moved upon
[15:10] us now yeah yes
[15:13] all right
[15:18] so revelation is only
[15:22] given to the elected bride of jesus
[15:25] christ
[15:27] luke 8 10-13 and he said unto you it is
[15:29] given to know the mysteries of the
[15:31] kingdom of god
[15:32] but to others in parables riddles that
[15:36] seeing they might not see
[15:37] and hearing they might not understand
[15:40] now the parable is this the seed is the
[15:42] word of god
[15:44] all right so we talked about that before
[15:47] in daniel chapter 12
[15:49] it's verse 10. you can refer back to
[15:51] that
[15:52] it's it's important to understand that
[15:56] that in daniel 12 will you josh will you
[15:59] pull that up
[16:00] let's flip over to the scriptures and
[16:02] pull up daniel 12.
[16:15] and i'll just read from eight then
[16:17] through ten
[16:20] and i heard but i understood not then
[16:22] said i o my lord
[16:24] what shall be the end of these things
[16:27] and he said go thy way daniel for the
[16:29] words are closed up
[16:31] and sealed till the time of the end
[16:34] so the understanding of the revelation
[16:38] is closed and sealed up until the time
[16:42] of the end
[16:45] then we see verse 10
[16:48] many shall be purified and made white
[16:51] and tried
[16:53] but the wicked shall do wickedly and
[16:55] none of the wicked shall understand
[16:57] but the wise shall understand
[17:00] so there is what are they going to
[17:02] understand they're going to understand
[17:04] what was sealed to daniel in other words
[17:07] there's going to be an
[17:08] opening of the word amen
[17:11] in the end time and the wise
[17:14] will understand that opening of the word
[17:17] and the wicked
[17:18] will not understand
[17:21] the opening of the word but notice
[17:24] what's said before that
[17:25] many shall be purified and made white
[17:29] and tried you know you you you look at
[17:32] that series brother branham preach the
[17:34] seals
[17:36] he started it out god in simplicity
[17:40] what did he talk about in that sermon
[17:44] the bleach right
[17:48] the bleach that which purifies
[17:53] sends it just obliterates it sends it
[17:56] back to its original elements
[17:58] put that ink in in bleach it sends it
[17:59] back to its original elements
[18:01] it's destroyed it's demolished doesn't
[18:04] even exist
[18:05] anymore and so then then he goes and
[18:08] preaches on
[18:09] on the breach and he says this is the
[18:11] most sublime
[18:14] verses in the scripture talking about
[18:16] redemption
[18:18] there's a redemption that took place
[18:21] in 1963 because of the opening of those
[18:26] seals
[18:27] that didn't take place when he died at
[18:28] calvary that didn't take place when the
[18:31] holy ghost fell on the day of pentecost
[18:34] he took jesus christ the one who was
[18:36] slain
[18:37] in 1963 took that book
[18:41] and broke the seals one by one
[18:44] and because of that what happened the
[18:47] full
[18:48] effects of the blood of christ could be
[18:51] upon us
[18:52] and then all the other ages it was
[18:55] imputed also to them they without
[18:57] us could not be made perfect why because
[19:00] the opening of the word has come
[19:02] broken that forth now it's the bleeding
[19:05] word
[19:07] look at what brother branham said in
[19:08] indictment when they rejected the
[19:10] passover lamb the paschal lamb when they
[19:13] rejected christ
[19:14] the passover lamb was not effective for
[19:16] them anymore
[19:18] now it was only to the blood of jesus
[19:21] christ
[19:22] now in this day they've crucified the
[19:25] word of god
[19:26] the son of god a second time as he's
[19:29] manifested before the people and they
[19:30] reject it and call it the works of the
[19:32] devil
[19:33] says they've crucified it again it goes
[19:35] from that blood
[19:37] to the word and the word alone
[19:42] amen so what does that mean
[19:45] the blood is not useless for us anymore
[19:48] well
[19:48] i don't think you can find not useful
[19:50] for any uh for us anymore
[19:52] you can't find that right in the message
[19:54] so what is he trying to say is that
[19:56] blood
[19:57] the effectiveness of the blood goes
[20:00] away from what it was before and goes
[20:03] into only what
[20:06] the word it's by the washing of water by
[20:10] the word
[20:11] bring that scripture up again many
[20:15] will be purified and made white
[20:19] and tried the wicked won't understand
[20:21] the wise will understand
[20:22] why do you think that those words are
[20:24] put together it's not a mistake
[20:28] it's not just random order many will be
[20:31] purified and made white and then what
[20:32] happens for them
[20:34] when they're purified and made white
[20:36] they receive a
[20:38] understanding a revelation of the open
[20:41] word
[20:42] that's the revealing of the open word
[20:46] let me back up and put that more clearly
[20:50] what washes them and makes them white
[20:54] the word what word the fully restored
[20:59] revealed word that was sealed away and
[21:02] hidden
[21:04] since the time of of daniel
[21:07] and before things that were hidden were
[21:10] not
[21:10] known amen were revealed in this day
[21:14] and through that revelation what happens
[21:16] to you and i
[21:18] we're purified made white
[21:23] and tried and what is it what is the
[21:26] difference
[21:27] what is the difference the wise
[21:29] understand
[21:30] the wicked don't understand oh it's all
[21:32] about intellect now
[21:33] no it's revelation
[21:36] it's a disclosure disclosure of what the
[21:39] word
[21:40] who's the word jesus christ
[21:44] so it's a revelation of jesus christ
[21:46] that cleanses
[21:48] and purifies the bride what did we read
[21:52] in 1st peter
[21:53] before we're waiting for what salvation
[21:57] ready to be revealed apocalypses
[22:02] unveiled in the last time amen
[22:06] this this what and what is that what
[22:09] it's the oh it's the seven thunders
[22:11] bringing forth the opening of the word
[22:13] what is that what is that
[22:15] it's the message it's the message
[22:19] what is what is that disclosure to us
[22:23] it's the message
[22:26] why do we need the message it's to bring
[22:29] to full fruition everything that
[22:33] jesus talked about and everything that
[22:35] paul talked about
[22:36] jesus prayed for oneness amongst his
[22:39] believers
[22:40] so god's answer was he sent a message
[22:45] to restore us back to the word and how
[22:47] do we get one with each other
[22:49] and with him amen
[22:54] by the word it's not it's not by
[22:57] politics
[22:58] it's not by unifying with each other
[23:02] first and foremost it's unifying with
[23:04] him
[23:06] all right let's go back to the
[23:07] powerpoint
[23:17] but if our gospel be hid
[23:21] it is let's go there next one yeah
[23:25] but if our gospel be hid it is hid to
[23:29] them
[23:30] that are lost
[23:33] if our gospel be hid what is the gospel
[23:37] what is the gospel is there seven
[23:39] gospels
[23:44] two gospels is there is there two ways
[23:48] three ways no jesus is the only way
[23:53] and who is jesus
[23:57] jesus is who he says he is
[24:00] he is as he has manifested manifested
[24:04] he says where i am
[24:07] there will my servant be also he doesn't
[24:10] say
[24:11] where my servant is i'll just follow him
[24:13] around wherever he goes
[24:15] no in other words as i manifest and
[24:18] declare myself
[24:19] my servant comes and follows me wherever
[24:22] i am
[24:24] right that's important we we want a
[24:27] jesus that we can just carry around in
[24:29] our pocket
[24:31] and say my jesus wouldn't do that
[24:34] who is your jesus i have no idea because
[24:37] he's not the jesus that's declared
[24:39] himself
[24:40] who is god who is god who who
[24:43] who should i say is sending me i am that
[24:46] i am
[24:48] i'm supposed to say that to them i
[24:51] i am that i am has sent me that sounds
[24:55] strange
[24:57] just say that i am i in other words it
[25:01] could
[25:01] almost be say i become i become
[25:04] who i become in other words i manifest
[25:06] myself
[25:08] and as i manifest myself you need
[25:11] to recognize that and put your faith in
[25:14] that
[25:15] that's the tricky part all through
[25:16] history man has said oh
[25:19] we like that other version of you in
[25:22] jeremiah's day
[25:24] they didn't know they didn't know
[25:26] nothing about god in jeremiah's day
[25:28] that's just their interpretation of who
[25:31] god is based on what they read
[25:33] in jeremiah's day but now we have john
[25:35] the baptist
[25:37] well i don't like john the baptist he's
[25:40] odd he's weird
[25:42] he doesn't do it like the rabbis and so
[25:44] forth
[25:46] he bothers me that's your problem
[25:49] that's not god's problem
[25:53] well i don't i don't like these
[25:54] disciples
[25:57] they're not what i would think of as
[25:59] educated
[26:00] men of god god doesn't care what you
[26:03] think
[26:06] well i don't i don't like this
[26:09] german monk stand up who does he think
[26:11] he has to tell all the
[26:13] dignitaries of the world that they're
[26:15] wrong in their understanding
[26:17] god sent him to do that
[26:20] i don't like this hillbilly from
[26:22] kentucky he has
[26:24] his grammar is terrible
[26:29] i don't i can't even hardly understand
[26:30] what he's saying
[26:33] yeah god don't care he doesn't care
[26:35] about your feelings or your thoughts
[26:40] he says i'm declaring myself in this day
[26:43] will you accept it will you receive it
[26:46] or will you turn your back
[26:47] on it that's that's a fact god
[26:50] vindicates who he is
[26:53] in each day and the children of god love
[26:55] it
[26:57] and rejoice in it and give thanks
[27:00] god places oh in every age
[27:03] what did he do what did he say about
[27:05] jesus
[27:07] they they stumbled at the stumbling
[27:09] stone
[27:10] oh that's not very nice
[27:13] we want a nicer god that doesn't make a
[27:16] stumbling stone in front of people
[27:19] go with the rest of the world and make
[27:21] up your own gods
[27:23] why do we want to do that man always
[27:25] wants to do that
[27:26] make his own nice comfortable god
[27:29] so that he can it can be easy and fine
[27:32] for him
[27:33] what is it it's god's of mental
[27:35] conceptions that people don't make
[27:38] a god of stone or
[27:41] gold or wood anymore they make a god
[27:44] after their own conception
[27:47] they've they've quote unquote evolved
[27:51] so something better well god is standing
[27:54] there
[27:54] i'm here i'm proving myself brother
[27:57] branham in the rapture message says
[27:58] god comes down from heaven and stands in
[28:00] front of groups of men
[28:02] and declares himself just as he ever did
[28:04] and they say
[28:06] could never be god
[28:10] that's up to you that's up to your
[28:13] choice
[28:13] but you're going to answer to that god
[28:15] who created the heavens and the earth
[28:17] and who manifests himself through his
[28:19] word and is faithful to his word
[28:21] it might not come the way that you think
[28:23] it should come
[28:25] that's what's that's why we need
[28:27] repentance because our thoughts are not
[28:29] the same as god's thoughts but if we
[28:32] repent
[28:33] and we turn to him we can receive what
[28:37] the mind of christ
[28:39] so our gospel is hid it's him hid to
[28:42] them that are lost
[28:44] so what do we need to declare to people
[28:47] the gospel what is the gospel the good
[28:50] news
[28:52] it's the death burial and resurrection
[28:53] of jesus christ absolutely
[28:56] and that he ascended too right we
[29:00] shouldn't stop at the
[29:01] death burial and resurrection he's not
[29:02] walking around on earth
[29:04] he ascended all right let's keep going
[29:08] then what did he do then he said at the
[29:10] right hand of god to make
[29:11] intercessions and then what did he do
[29:14] the holy ghost came back let's keep
[29:16] going we got to keep going
[29:17] got to keep moving well now i'm a
[29:19] catholic
[29:21] well here god sends martin luther oh no
[29:24] stop stop stop stop i'm done
[29:26] i'm good don't give me any more
[29:30] really why do you want to stop there
[29:33] because i mean i think you know what god
[29:36] did before is just fine
[29:38] you when you when you stop moving with
[29:40] god
[29:41] yeah you're left alone and god keeps
[29:44] moving
[29:45] so you fast forward then keep going you
[29:48] don't stay a lutheran
[29:49] when john wesley brings his message
[29:52] what happens then
[29:56] you're not following god
[30:00] does that mean they go to hell i mean
[30:03] probably
[30:05] it's not ultimately up to me but i want
[30:08] to know that i want to be
[30:09] found following the word in its fullness
[30:12] i don't want to follow something from a
[30:15] pastime
[30:16] a past age i want to follow them today
[30:19] then god sends a hillbilly
[30:23] and it confounds the world amen
[30:28] but yet if it's hid
[30:31] it's hid to who those that are lost
[30:35] so we preach what continuing the full
[30:38] word
[30:39] every day every age it's not that it's a
[30:42] new word it's not a new word
[30:43] it's pointing us back to the fullness of
[30:45] this word what they had in part in other
[30:48] ages
[30:49] we have in fullness today god's
[30:52] eagles of this day
[30:55] respond to that word they love it
[30:58] they're not stumbled by it they don't
[31:00] need a watered-down version
[31:03] they don't know we need a weaker version
[31:06] they want
[31:07] this strong meat well they're babies
[31:10] they're this i i
[31:12] get all that we should start our
[31:14] children and and help them learn the
[31:16] abcs
[31:17] we should continually be bringing in
[31:19] foundations to all of us
[31:21] because if the foundation gets destroyed
[31:24] we even if we have a foundation laid we
[31:26] should still maintain it right
[31:27] brother brad that we vacuum it right we
[31:31] clean it up
[31:32] if it gets a crack in it we fill it in
[31:34] we get somebody to come in and look at
[31:36] and say oh man well
[31:38] let's take care of that foundation why
[31:39] because we know everything else is
[31:41] is based upon that so we keep working on
[31:44] the foundation but we don't stop
[31:47] on the foundation we have to have the
[31:49] whole thing why because we're living in
[31:51] the age of what
[31:52] strong meat we're living in the age
[31:56] where god is calling a bride to
[31:58] perfection
[31:59] he's not calling us to be drinking milk
[32:03] in fact even in the first age paul paul
[32:05] was chastising the people and say you
[32:07] should be on
[32:07] strong meat by now instead you're just
[32:10] drinking milk
[32:13] milk is for babies so we need to be we
[32:16] need to be in the place where the
[32:18] foundation is there it's maintained
[32:21] but yet we know we've got to finish
[32:24] the building of this house amen
[32:28] and what what is the building of this
[32:30] house it's the full word
[32:32] we need to declare the full message
[32:35] that's when i when i first started
[32:38] working with iranians i thought well we
[32:39] just got to preach the gospel to them
[32:41] it's
[32:42] it's uh they don't know any they don't
[32:44] know anything better yeah of course we
[32:46] preach the gospel
[32:47] but why would you do that apart from the
[32:50] message
[32:51] you you you lay in serpent seed
[32:54] right away preach preach them about
[32:57] serpents he'd preach to them
[32:59] about the necessity of the blood being
[33:03] shed because of sin
[33:05] but then you don't stop there you've got
[33:06] to get him almost immediately
[33:09] to the opening of the word you don't
[33:12] leave that until two years later
[33:15] why because because that's the that's
[33:18] it's not the age for that
[33:20] it's not the time for that we're not
[33:22] living under billy graham's
[33:24] message we're not blinding the people in
[33:26] sodom
[33:27] we're living under something different
[33:30] it's an
[33:30] opening of the word that's to bring
[33:33] maturity
[33:35] i barely got even three or four slides
[33:38] there so
[33:39] let's stand up we'll continue
[33:42] next time i speak on seven thunders
[33:46] heavenly father we just come to you lord
[33:48] and we're so thankful for the word
[33:50] i pray that you just continue to lay it
[33:52] into our hearts father
[33:54] build our faith may it rise higher
[33:58] deeper in the things lord that you have
[34:00] for us in this day lord may we
[34:02] continue to feast on eagle food father
[34:06] commit each one to you lord we ask that
[34:08] you be glorified in the
[34:10] in the in the songs and the worship and
[34:13] and in the preaching of the word today
[34:15] lord
[34:15] may each one get themselves out of the
[34:17] way that you'd be glorified in jesus
[34:19] name amen
[34:20] amen god bless you
