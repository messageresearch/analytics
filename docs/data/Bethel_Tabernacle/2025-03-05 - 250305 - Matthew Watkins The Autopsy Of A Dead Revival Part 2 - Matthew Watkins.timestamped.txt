[11:37] how we long to just be so separated from
[11:40] the things of this world and this chaos
[11:42] that's going
[11:44] on. We thank you for your Holy Spirit
[11:46] that we can look at things that don't
[11:48] include the things of this world.
[11:50] Father, we can think on things that are
[11:53] pure, that are holy, that are
[11:56] righteous. We can look at the cross
[11:58] where you paid that ultimate price.
[12:01] And we can look where you sent the Holy
[12:03] Spirit back in our day and time to each
[12:05] and every one of us, Father, to give us
[12:07] that that we have needed, that uncction
[12:10] to live this life in
[12:12] victory. Thank you, Father. Pray that
[12:15] you bless the tithes and offerings.
[12:17] Continue to bless the service. Help us,
[12:19] Lord, set aside everything and put you
[12:23] first. In Jesus name we pray. Amen.

[17:31] wide, I will worship
[17:36] you. So I throw up my hands and praise
[17:41] you again and
[17:43] again. Yes, Lord. All that I have is a

[21:29] [Music]
[21:30] men. I want to
[21:34] pray like him.
[21:40] He taught us to
[21:43] [Music]
[21:44] speak to the mountains and
[21:49] seek. The storm will
[21:52] [Applause]
[21:54] oy and demons will
[21:58] flee. He spoke into
[22:03] a dead lift again.
[22:10] I want to
[22:12] speak like
[22:14] [Music]
[22:17] him. His way is always
[22:22] right, just like it was back then.
[22:27] I'll follow his
[22:30] example above the ways of
[22:35] men and tomorrow yet
[22:41] again. I want to
[22:44] be like him.
[22:48] [Music]
[22:50] He taught us to
[22:53] live as a light to the
[22:58] world, to seek for the
[23:02] truth, and it shall be
[23:07] revealed. He followed God's
[23:11] will as he wept in the garden.
[23:18] I want to
[23:20] live like
[23:24] him. He taught us to
[23:28] love as he died on a
[23:33] cross to a thief. He gave
[23:37] life. saved a world that was
[23:41] lost while he carried their
[23:46] sins. Father,
[23:49] forgive
[23:52] them. I want to
[23:55] love like
[23:59] him. His way is always
[24:03] right, just like it was back then.
[24:09] I'll follow his
[24:12] example above the ways of
[24:16] men and tomorrow yet again.
[24:23] I want to

[24:28] him for his way is always
[24:33] right. Just like it was back
[24:38] then. I'll follow his

[24:51] again. I want to
[24:55] be like
[24:57] [Music]
[24:58] him. I want to
[25:01] be like
[25:08] him. Praise the
[25:11] Lord. Thank you, Sister Josie. Brother
[25:14] Steve's got a special for us, too. I
[25:16] think he owes us about a dozen, him and
[25:19] Emily. So, we're gonna just every
[25:23] service, you know, until the rapture.
[25:31] Let's give him a deep hand.
[25:35] [Applause]
[25:45] Well, the rate we're going, I don't
[25:46] think the rapture that I don't think
[25:48] that's too far away. So, might not be a
[25:50] bad
[25:52] [Music]
[26:01] deal. As I looked at the pathway up the
[26:05] mountain, I have trod weary worn and
[26:09] feet a little
[26:11] sore. Thought by now I'd be much further
[26:14] up the road than where I am. I've cast
[26:17] aside some weight, but must do so much
[26:21] more. There's no time to waste my
[26:23] fleeting precious
[26:26] time. He's setting weight with haze. I
[26:29] will swiftly cast
[26:32] [Music]
[26:35] aside. No time to stay. Oh, I'll keep
[26:38] pressing
[26:39] on. I can hardly wait. I know I'm almost
[26:45] [Music]
[26:47] home. Oft gaze across the valley of
[26:50] decision where I was and thank the Lord
[26:54] he led me from that
[26:57] place. The heights I've gained are
[26:59] greater than were all my yesterdays. But
[27:03] I must press on to see my savior's
[27:06] face. There's no time to waste my
[27:09] fleeting precious
[27:12] time. He's setting weight with haze. I
[27:15] will swiftly cast
[27:18] aside. No time to stay. I'll keep
[27:21] pressing
[27:23] on. I can hardly wait. I know I'm almost
[27:28] [Music]
[27:39] home. When I reach the gates of glory,
[27:43] only then will I take rest. But the
[27:46] first thing I will do when I get
[27:50] home, I'll crawl up to my Jesus and I'll
[27:54] weep down at his feet. My source of joy,
[27:58] the savior of my
[28:03] soul. Oh, there's no time to waste. My
[28:06] fleeting precious
[28:09] time setting wave with haste I will
[28:13] swiftly cast
[28:15] aside. No time to stay or I'll keep
[28:18] pressing
[28:20] on. I can hardly wait. I know I'm almost
[28:25] home. There's no time to waste my
[28:27] fleeting precious time.
[28:31] resetting weight with haste. I will
[28:34] swiftly cast
[28:36] aside. No time to stay or I'll keep
[28:39] pressing
[28:41] on. I can hardly wait. I know I'm almost
[28:46] home. No time to stay. I'll keep
[28:49] pressing
[28:51] on. I can hardly wait. I know I'm almost
[28:55] home.
[28:58] [Music]
[29:05] Praise
[29:07] God.
[29:09] Amen. We're almost to home, saints.
[29:13] Amen. And uh we got a last minute
[29:16] request for But I'm not going to ask you
[29:19] to come up, Sister Amber. There was a
[29:21] last minute request came in for you to
[29:23] sing, but brother Matt's ready to come
[29:26] in. She lucked
[29:28] out. Be ready Sunday,
[29:30] though. Be ready Sunday. All right,
[29:33] let's uh let's all
[29:36] stand. I you know, I I I I can tell you
[29:40] this. I feel like when I heard Steve
[29:42] practicing that song in the back, I kept
[29:44] thinking he had to have heard brother
[29:46] Matt's sermon on Sunday about a fervent
[29:50] worship and a fervent life for Christ
[29:53] because that song, it's got some
[29:55] ferveny. Brother Steve, I love that. I
[29:58] just wanted to remind y'all in case
[30:00] brother Matt doesn't show this quote
[30:02] that he he he brought up um on Sunday
[30:06] and it says, let me get my
[30:10] glasses. Says the fervent desire to
[30:14] please God, the passion to know his
[30:17] word, the cry for reaching out in the
[30:21] spirit all begins to fade. And instead
[30:25] of that church being on fire with the
[30:28] fire of God, it has cooled off and
[30:30] become a bit formal. That is what's
[30:34] happening back there in the Ephesians.
[30:36] And that was from the Ephesian church
[30:38] age. And I had to take a picture of that
[30:41] and I've been reading it every day
[30:43] because I don't want that to happen to
[30:45] me and I don't want that to happen to
[30:47] this church. And each one of us has a
[30:50] part to play to make sure that that
[30:52] doesn't happen.
[30:54] Can you say amen? Let's sing this little
[30:57] song here as we invite brother Matt to
[30:59] come. It's refiner's
[31:03] fire.
[31:06] Purify my heart.
[31:10] Let me be as
[31:15] gold and
[31:17] preious
[31:19] silver
[31:22] purify my
[31:25] heart. Let me be as gold.
[31:31] [Music]
[31:32] [Applause]
[31:34] your
[31:36] gold
[31:39] refiner's
[31:44] found my
[31:47] heart
[31:51] desire is to
[31:56] be
[31:57] [Music]
[32:00] holy set A
[32:03] part for you,
[32:06] Lord. I choose to
[32:12] be
[32:16] holy, set
[32:19] aart for
[32:21] you, my
[32:24] master, ready to do your will. Let's
[32:29] sing that chorus again without the
[32:32] music.
[32:35] Refiner's
[32:40] fire. My heart's one
[32:47] desire is to
[32:52] be holy.
[32:57] set
[32:59] aart for you,
[33:02] Lord. I choose to
[33:05] [Music]
[33:08] be
[33:11] holy, set
[33:14] aart for
[33:16] you, my
[33:20] master, ready to do your will.
[33:25] [Music]
[33:37] My heart's one
[33:43] desire is to
[33:48] be holy,
[33:52] holy, set aart heart for you, Lord. I
[33:59] choose I choose to
[34:04] be
[34:08] holy. Set
[34:11] aart for
[34:13] you, my
[34:16] master, and ready to do your your will.
[34:25] Amen. And you're ready to do his will.
[34:27] Amen. Praise the Lord. God bless you. If
[34:29] you have your Bible, we'll turn to two
[34:30] scriptures. One in Leviticus chapter 6
[34:33] to have you turn there. And then uh
[34:35] we'll turn to the book of Acts, chapter
[34:36] 2. Amen. Praise the Lord. You love the
[34:39] Lord Jesus. Amen. Amen. Thank you,
[34:42] brother Ken. That song was just so
[34:44] perfect and fitting for Amen. what the
[34:46] Lord has just burdened us with here for
[34:48] tonight. We didn't uh quite get finished
[34:51] on Sunday. So, uh the Lord just knew uh
[34:54] knew best where to stop us. And so, we
[34:56] just want to pick right up from where we
[34:57] were. Amen. Don't you just love being in
[35:00] church? Amen. Love this Christian way. I
[35:03] love it with all of my heart. Amen. My
[35:05] goodness. I don't know what I would do.
[35:07] Even if you know I just I know that uh
[35:11] that you know what we believe is
[35:12] absolutely the truth but man even if
[35:15] even if this was just a you know just a
[35:17] farce. I'd rather live like this as a
[35:20] believer than what they got out there.
[35:22] Amen. Just in comparison with just the
[35:24] the neurotic age and the pressure that
[35:26] they live under. I'm but I'm so glad to
[35:28] know that it's more than just a story.
[35:31] Amen. It's a living reality down inside
[35:33] of my heart. Amen. Praise the Lord. We
[35:35] just want to um want to go straight to
[35:38] Leviticus chapter 6 and we'll just begin
[35:40] reading here. Let's just begin reading
[35:42] here at verse 12. Amen. Thank you,
[35:45] brother Ken, for giving me some extra
[35:46] time. I asked him for that. We uh devil
[35:49] just fought us today and was running
[35:50] just really behind thankfully uh
[35:52] prepared uh for the service, but um but
[35:56] just uh looking for the Lord to do
[35:58] something. Did you come with an empty
[35:59] cup? Amen. How many came with an empty
[36:01] cup? Say, "Lord, I'm emptying myself of
[36:04] everything yesterday, today, what
[36:06] happened, what's going to happen
[36:07] tomorrow." Amen. That's what it means to
[36:09] empty oursel out. Just to completely
[36:11] come before the Lord neutral and say,
[36:13] "Lord, fill me now." Amen. Fill me now.
[36:17] Leviticus chapter 6, we would we just
[36:19] want to continue. I gave it the title
[36:21] Sunday, the autopsy of a dead revival.
[36:24] What a
[36:25] title. Amen. Now, we're not going to
[36:27] pull out any kind of metal tables and
[36:29] lay any kind of uh, you know, corpses
[36:31] except for except for this corpse. The
[36:33] things that are behind us, as Paul said,
[36:36] forget those things and press on to the
[36:38] new. Amen. Press on to the high calling.
[36:41] Amen. So, um, we just want to continue
[36:44] that thought of the Lord will be our
[36:45] help here tonight. Let's just begin
[36:47] reading Leviticus chapter 6 and verse
[36:49] 12. And the fire upon the altar shall be
[36:52] burning in it. It shall not be put out.
[36:55] And the priest shall burn wood on it
[36:57] every morning, and lay the burnt
[36:59] offering in order upon it. And he shall
[37:01] burn thereon the fat of the peace
[37:03] offering. The fire shall ever be burning
[37:07] upon the altar. Now, it's important that
[37:10] the fire burns, but it's also important
[37:13] where it burns. Notice that the altar
[37:17] was just as important as the fire.
[37:21] It's one thing to have a fire, but if
[37:23] it's misplaced and it's not if if the
[37:27] fire was just a wildfire and it just
[37:29] spread, the same fire that can warm you
[37:31] and create an atmosphere is also the
[37:33] same one that can bring destruction. But
[37:36] fire in its proper place, which is the
[37:39] place of sacrifice, is what the point of
[37:41] the altar is. Listen, an altar, the
[37:44] entire purpose of the altar was not just
[37:46] a, you know, a tradition that was
[37:49] instituted by man and church, but
[37:51] actually goes all the way back to the
[37:53] sacrifice that Abel makes uh uh uh and
[37:56] brother Brandon said that Abel was slain
[37:58] on the same rock as his sacrifice was
[38:02] slain upon. Now, think about that
[38:04] statement just for a moment. Abel was
[38:06] slain upon the same altar. In other
[38:10] words, it was going to be in type that
[38:13] he was going to be identified with that
[38:16] death. Not just the death of a lamb, but
[38:19] he was identifying himself. Now, you can
[38:21] think of Abel, but how about we think of
[38:23] Calvary, Mount Calvary? That's wonderful
[38:25] to see that sacrifice, but you've got to
[38:28] be identified in that sacrifice. You've
[38:30] got to say, Lord, I want to be
[38:32] identified in your death. And if I'm not
[38:35] identified in your death, I'll never be
[38:36] identified in resurrection. How many
[38:39] want to be identified in the
[38:40] resurrection? We first got to be
[38:42] identified here with our fire. And what
[38:45] is the sacrifice? The Bible says,
[38:46] "Present your bodies as a living
[38:50] sacrifice, which is your reasonable
[38:52] service." Look at it. Verse 13. The fire
[38:55] shall ever be burning upon the altar. It
[38:58] shall never go out. Lord Jesus, we just
[39:01] thank you for the reading of your word.
[39:03] asking Lord for your help God how we
[39:06] need it tonight Lord Jesus I pray that
[39:09] you would come and all of these that
[39:11] have gathered here Lord in this building
[39:13] Father they didn't come to see me Lord
[39:16] Father we didn't come just because it's
[39:18] Wednesday and it's what we do Lord out
[39:21] of a habit in our life it's wonderful
[39:23] Lord it's a good habit to have but I
[39:26] pray God that there would be something
[39:27] deeper down on the inside of us Lord God
[39:30] that there would be a yearning and a
[39:32] pulling
[39:33] Father, an earnest cry, a ferveny, Lord,
[39:36] from our hearts to hear from you, Lord
[39:39] Jesus. I pray that you would help me
[39:41] now, God. And may the words that I
[39:43] speak, Lord, in this Wednesday night
[39:44] service, Lord, may I be able to present
[39:47] you in such a way, Lord, that sinners
[39:50] would, Lord, would see their sin and
[39:52] repent. That those that would be bound
[39:55] would be set free, Lord. That those that
[39:57] need to fall deeper in love with you.
[40:01] and I just raise my hands and say, "Yes,
[40:03] Lord. I want to fall deeper in love with
[40:05] you tonight." I pray, God, that you
[40:07] would come and make yourself real by
[40:09] your word. Lord, we depend on you now in
[40:11] Jesus Christ's name. Amen. You can be
[40:16] seated. I want to just pick up straight
[40:18] from where we were. And if you could
[40:20] just pull that PowerPoint. I didn't I
[40:22] thought that I sent it. Let me make sure
[40:23] that I did. I'm sorry I did send it. I
[40:27] think I I closed my laptop just a little
[40:29] bit too early. Forgive me. Just give me
[40:32] one second here. Amen. Let me send it to
[40:36] you. I thought that I sent that. So,
[40:39] check the check it. I'm going to send it
[40:40] a second time. Make sure you get
[40:43] it.
[40:45] Amen. Somebody say, "Praise the Lord."
[40:49] want to pick up right from where we were
[40:51] on Sunday and I I just got a little bit
[40:53] pressed out for time and so we just want
[40:55] to just go straight into the vein that
[40:57] we were in on the autopsy of a dead
[41:00] revival. Brother Barnaman says this in
[41:03] the Ephesian church age the one brother
[41:04] Ken was quoting and he says now history
[41:07] keeps repeating itself in the generation
[41:10] of Israel we see revival in one
[41:12] generation only to see the fires fading
[41:16] and in the next in the third generation
[41:18] embers may be glowing slightly but in
[41:21] the fourth there be be there may be no
[41:24] vestage whatsoever of that original
[41:28] flame. And so he says, now notice what
[41:30] he says here. And so there may be no
[41:33] vestage whatsoever of that original
[41:35] flame. Then God lights the fire again
[41:40] and the same process is repeated. I
[41:44] thought this was so amazing how brother
[41:46] Brandham points to these first
[41:48] generation revival and the experience
[41:51] that they had under that first
[41:53] generation. But then you move on out
[41:55] from that to a second to the second
[41:58] generation. And then he says there may
[42:01] be some evidence of that original first
[42:03] work. But then he says then in the third
[42:06] the embers may be glowing slightly.
[42:09] Right? Embers may be glowing slightly
[42:12] but in the fourth there may be no
[42:14] vestage or
[42:16] evidence of that original flame. It's
[42:19] incredible because when you think of a
[42:21] generation, it's 20 to 30 years. And so
[42:25] you think from that, if we just call it
[42:27] 20 years for a generation, that would be
[42:31] 60 years to the third generation. And
[42:34] and brother Brandham says in that after
[42:37] that that many
[42:39] years he says that there eventually he
[42:42] says the fire completely goes out and
[42:45] all that you have left in his words is
[42:48] the blackness of
[42:50] ashes and he starts to point to the the
[42:53] signs and we're we're speaking to you on
[42:56] I titled that for a reason not just to
[42:57] get a big title. I'm not normally, you
[43:01] know, I don't stress over titles, but
[43:02] the Lord just gave me that one just
[43:04] suddenly as I was reading this quote
[43:06] because I thought it was so perfect to
[43:09] show what is what was, if we're looking
[43:12] at a past revival of a dead revival,
[43:16] what was the previous revival? What was
[43:19] the signs if we can say it that way?
[43:22] What let me just make it as as I come
[43:25] just to the center of my heart. What
[43:28] killed the revival?
[43:30] Or we can say, what's a revival killer?
[43:34] Now, we could go all the way back, and
[43:36] I'm not going to do that. The I just
[43:38] wouldn't have time. Time would fail me
[43:40] to do it. But you could look back all
[43:42] the way to what they call the first
[43:45] awakening. That that's the word we use
[43:47] for revival. As we showed you on Sunday,
[43:51] the meaning or Wednesday before that,
[43:53] the meaning of the word revive is to
[43:57] save a corpse or save a body that's or
[44:01] save a person or revive them for that's
[44:04] at risk of becoming a corpse or being
[44:07] completely dead. So you could look at
[44:10] that word revival as the word awakening.
[44:12] You could look all the way back in the
[44:14] 1730s and 1740s of what they call the
[44:16] first awakening. And it's amazing
[44:19] because that first awakening happened.
[44:21] You can think of men like Jonathan
[44:22] Edwards who brother JD has mentioned
[44:24] many times and and if you ever read some
[44:27] of Whitfield or uh or or John Wesley,
[44:30] sorry, or George Whitfield and also uh
[44:33] Jonathan Edwards and you look at the way
[44:36] that that first revival in the late
[44:39] mid700s started. You remember brother
[44:41] John Andy's preached on that when he
[44:44] spoke to us at our at our uh youth event
[44:47] and he talked about a little a little
[44:49] woman and I can't remember her name but
[44:53] um but she she she stood up in the
[44:56] middle of a
[44:57] meeting and I think her words were
[45:00] burning me. Was that her word? Something
[45:01] like that. Burn or or something like
[45:04] that. Burning me Lord. And uh uh that
[45:07] wasn't bend me. That's what it was. Bend
[45:09] me Lord. bend me. That's what she her
[45:12] heart's cry. It was something, Lord,
[45:14] bend me to your will is what she was
[45:16] saying. And if you look historically,
[45:18] they they they point as he was showing
[45:20] us, they point to that cry from that
[45:23] little sister from inside of her heart.
[45:26] She wanted to see the Lord move so bad.
[45:29] She had a hunger and a cry to see the
[45:31] the Lord move in her generation. And she
[45:33] said, "Bend me, oh God." And and from
[45:36] that moment, it starts an entire revival
[45:39] that sweeps through that church. And and
[45:41] we call it a revival fire because it's
[45:43] very much like a fire in that a fire is
[45:46] contagious. It spreads. It doesn't just
[45:49] stay in one spot. And if you look at
[45:51] that, it started that entire revival was
[45:54] based upon a a a hunger for I was
[45:57] looking at it today, a hunger for true
[46:01] repentance. Isn't that amazing? a hunger
[46:05] for true
[46:07] repentance. We took a lot of time on
[46:09] Sunday to show what real repentance
[46:12] really means. It was a a a a a cry for
[46:16] true repentance to really come back to
[46:18] God. It was a and and they they the they
[46:21] the the the revival spread. You can look
[46:23] through it. But over time, what you'll
[46:26] find when you look at that revival is
[46:28] that that original move, though it was
[46:31] authentic, though it was a real move of
[46:33] the Holy Spirit really pouring himself
[46:35] out uh in that in that in that city, yet
[46:40] what was what what once was true and
[46:43] authentic, after a while, if you just
[46:46] keep going from that moment and and and
[46:48] people don't come under that same
[46:50] conviction or that same experience, then
[46:53] it just becomes comes a name only or
[46:56] just an emotion or just a creed. And
[46:59] that eventually that emotion without any
[47:03] depth to true reality just becomes
[47:07] another dead
[47:09] revival. Amazing. I was reading then
[47:11] humble thyself today and I read a quote
[47:14] that I didn't have time to put up here
[47:15] that I I'll just I'll read it for you. I
[47:18] do have it in my notes but I didn't have
[47:20] it uh I wasn't able to get it out before
[47:22] you. I thought it was so amazing. It's
[47:24] staggering really when I when I read it.
[47:26] Brother Brandham says in it's not in
[47:28] humble thyself. It's in remembering the
[47:30] Lord in
[47:31] 1963. And he says, "I wonder, brethren,
[47:34] let's think seriously now. We
[47:37] Pentecostal people, listen to this. I
[47:40] wonder if we receive the Holy Ghost just
[47:44] for
[47:47] entertainment." I'm let that sink in
[47:49] just for a moment. He's talking to the
[47:52] assemblies of God, Pentecostal people. I
[47:55] wonder if we receive the Holy Ghost just
[47:58] for entertainment. Now, I want to make a
[48:01] clear distinction here. Brother Brandham
[48:03] was not criticizing receiving the Holy
[48:06] Ghost for entertainment. In fact,
[48:09] entertainment can become a buzzword or a
[48:11] bad word if you would think in a
[48:13] negative context. But entertainment
[48:15] simply means to entertain the Lord. And
[48:18] I believe that as believers, we ought to
[48:20] be entertaining the Lord.
[48:23] I believe every church service, can I
[48:25] just start off by saying every church
[48:27] service should not be a form. It should
[48:29] not be a tradition. If you've got to be
[48:31] begged to praise God, there's something
[48:34] cold about your revival. Hello, somebody
[48:37] help me preach here tonight. If we've
[48:38] got to be begged and got to be pushed
[48:40] and got to be prodded to say amen to the
[48:43] word of God, I think it's time that we
[48:45] take account as to what we're
[48:47] entertaining. But if we truly are
[48:50] entertaining the Lord, as the Bible even
[48:52] says, some unknown, unknowingly have
[48:55] entertained angels. There's that word
[48:57] entertainment. Have entertained angels
[48:59] unaware. I believe my with all of my
[49:01] heart, my brother, my sister, the Bible
[49:04] says when Abraham got up to sacrifice
[49:06] Isaac, he didn't come dragging out of
[49:08] bed, slept in till 9:00, 10:00. Go read
[49:12] your Bible after God told Abraham to
[49:14] sacrifice his only son who he loved, who
[49:18] was the promise of that the Lord gave
[49:20] him. And go read your Bible and you'll
[49:22] find that the Bible says that Abraham
[49:24] rose early in the morning. Imagine that
[49:29] you're going to sacrifice your the thing
[49:31] that God gave you and you're not
[49:33] sleeping in. You're not got a headache
[49:36] that morning and dragging out of bed
[49:37] like we do sometimes to church on a
[49:40] Sunday morning. Barely able to get there
[49:41] for uh for Sunday school. I'm not even
[49:44] preaching on that. So, don't let me lose
[49:46] you. But I believe, let me just say it
[49:49] this way. I believe it should be the joy
[49:51] of our life to come to the house of God
[49:54] and to worship the Lord. I believe that
[49:56] our Christianity is more than a
[49:59] lifestyle. It's more than what we do on
[50:01] Sunday and what we do on Wednesday. It's
[50:03] who we are. As David said, it's our my
[50:06] portion and my passion is to serve the
[50:08] Lord with all of my heart. Amen. You
[50:11] shouldn't have to be begged. You
[50:12] shouldn't have to be prodded. We
[50:14] shouldn't have to be pushed. It should
[50:16] be bubbling up from the inside of the
[50:19] inside. If it's a true revival and not
[50:21] just a form and not just your tradition,
[50:23] friends, you won't have to be begged
[50:25] into it. You won't have to be prodded
[50:27] into it. You won't have to be the music
[50:29] won't have to be won't matter who's
[50:31] leading songs. Won't matter who's who's
[50:33] on the instruments. Won't matter who's
[50:34] preaching that night. Amen. It'll be
[50:37] something that comes from down on the
[50:39] inside of the inside. You don't have to
[50:42] I I just feel to stop here and preach.
[50:44] You don't have to beg an alcoholic to
[50:46] get drunk. It's what he does. It's who
[50:48] he is. It's what he's found joy in. You
[50:51] don't have to beg that nicotine addict.
[50:53] You don't have to beg that drug addict
[50:54] to take a hit of of his drugs because
[50:57] that's the high he's looking for. What
[50:59] is it? You don't have to beg him, man.
[51:01] That alcoholic will sell everything he's
[51:03] got. He'll bust up his family. He'll
[51:06] lose his home. He'll lose his job. He'll
[51:08] ride around on a moped. He'll lose his
[51:10] driver's license. Come on, somebody help
[51:12] me preach. I'm talking about a carnal
[51:15] alcoholic. And brother says, "Don't pick
[51:17] on that man. Maybe that's all he's got.
[51:19] He's never found the real thing. But
[51:21] what about us who have found the real
[51:24] thing? The pearl of great price. You
[51:27] don't have to beg them. Listen, those
[51:29] clubs, they don't have to go outside and
[51:30] put out signs like we do at church and
[51:32] try to come Sunday and make some kind of
[51:34] great announcement and have a special
[51:36] speaker. Those clubs fill up every
[51:38] Friday night. It's what they do on
[51:39] Friday night. They party. They they, as
[51:42] brother Kevin will tell you, go to do
[51:44] ride alongs with him. He said, "Don't
[51:46] even come out during a ride along till
[51:47] about 1 or 2:00 in the morning." Why?
[51:50] Because that's about the time when they
[51:51] start letting out the clubs. Ain't that
[51:52] true, Brother Kevin? What is it? They've
[51:54] lived their life. That's what they do.
[51:56] They're on It's Friday night and they're
[51:58] there to to serve their God. Well, I got
[52:01] news for the devil. It's Wednesday night
[52:03] and I'm a believer of the true word of
[52:06] God. I'm a believer and this is what we
[52:08] do as Christians. This is our portion.
[52:14] If we if it's cold, just another dead
[52:16] church service, friends, what what
[52:18] where's our expectation? We ought to be
[52:20] burning with passion and zeal and
[52:23] ferveny to serve the Lord.
[52:26] I wonder, brethren, let me let's think
[52:28] seriously. Now, listen how he says this.
[52:30] He says, I wonder if we receive the Holy
[52:32] Ghost just for entertainment. Listen.
[52:35] But there's more than that goes with it.
[52:39] Amen. There's a life got to be lived.
[52:44] I wonder if that's the hindrances in our
[52:47] churches, brothers. I wonder if that's
[52:49] the reason that we're still back here in
[52:51] the wilderness wandering around instead
[52:53] of over in the promised land possessing
[52:55] all things. I wonder if there isn't
[52:58] something we haven't thought seriously
[53:00] enough about. You must think
[53:04] seriously. It's not that I just want to
[53:06] make a clear distinction. And it's not
[53:07] that brother Brandham was against
[53:09] entertaining the
[53:10] Lord. But when that revival, as we
[53:13] pointed out with Jonathan Edwards in the
[53:16] 17, 1800s, and every revival you look
[53:18] past that, past that awakening, you go
[53:20] to the next one, you'll always find it
[53:22] goes back to form. Go on to the second
[53:24] great awakening of Charles Finny and
[53:27] Francis Asbury, Peter Cartrite, who we
[53:29] preached on here before. And in the
[53:31] 1790s, 1830s, you always find a true
[53:34] move of God. Only eventually those fires
[53:37] begin to fade and it becomes form and it
[53:39] becomes tradition and it just becomes
[53:42] sacrimonial and religiosity. And let me
[53:44] just say God can't stand religion. He
[53:47] can't stand religiosity or traditions.
[53:51] I'll give you the but God can't stand a
[53:53] dead gospel, a dead a dead religion
[53:56] without life.
[53:58] That's why brother Brandon would make a
[53:59] statement like I'd rather have a little
[54:01] wildfire than no fire at all. It's not
[54:03] that we support wildfire, but but but
[54:06] I'd rather have some fire than no fire
[54:08] at all because God can't stand dead
[54:11] things. Even his prophets weren't
[54:12] allowed to touch dead things. Yes.
[54:16] So, so it always goes back to this. It
[54:19] always goes back to this. And eventually
[54:21] that fragmentation comes and those
[54:23] revival fires are not reit on the next
[54:26] generation. And then you see it go over
[54:29] as he says second generation, third
[54:32] generation. And then he says in the
[54:34] fourth there may be no
[54:36] vestage of that original pull it back up
[54:39] if you could that original
[54:43] flame. I was hearing a man that was so
[54:45] powerful, so incredible. I just thought
[54:47] it was a such an amazing point he made.
[54:50] And he wasn't a he he was just a a a a
[54:52] he's back maybe lived this man's passed
[54:55] away now. lived a quite a quite a number
[54:57] of years ago. And he spoke about how
[55:01] that he was he was teaching and a man
[55:03] and he was teaching on on on on what a
[55:06] true Christian
[55:08] is and the necessity for a true uh
[55:13] transformation. Not just a a a a
[55:17] uh you know just a a conforming but a
[55:20] true transforming, not just a reforming.
[55:22] And a man stood up in his meeting and
[55:24] said, "Hey," he said, "I'll" and he was
[55:26] preaching. It was a he was a missionary.
[55:28] And he said, "I you ask anybody in
[55:31] here." He says, "You ask anybody in here
[55:34] and all these people." And he says, and
[55:37] this man was an atheist. Spoke up and
[55:39] said he was an
[55:40] atheist. And he said, he said, "You ask
[55:43] any of these people in this room and
[55:44] they'll tell you where do they come when
[55:46] they need something? Who do they come
[55:48] to? Who gives them when they don't have
[55:50] any?" And he says, 'Who does more for
[55:53] them when they're in need? Who do they
[55:55] come
[55:55] after? And he says, 'They'll tell you.
[55:58] He says, I'm not bragging, not trying to
[55:59] brag on myself, but he says, you ask any
[56:01] of these Christians in this room, who
[56:03] lives a good life, who lives a moral
[56:05] life, who gives to the poor, feeds the
[56:07] hungry? And he was pointing to all the
[56:10] things that he does in the goodness of
[56:12] his heart. And he said, in other words,
[56:13] he was trying to use that same old
[56:15] argument that I can be just as good
[56:16] without God, right? and I don't need
[56:19] your religion and I don't need your God
[56:21] uh your gospel because I'm better than
[56:23] anybody in this room and I don't even
[56:25] believe in
[56:26] God. And he thought he had him. That
[56:29] preacher said something that man said
[56:30] something so profound and he and the man
[56:32] the preacher said he said the Lord just
[56:34] I said Lord I need a word I need a a a
[56:37] word of wisdom from you. I need a g a
[56:39] word of knowledge. And he said the Lord
[56:41] spoke to his heart and and like he was
[56:44] you know that he didn't have an answer
[56:45] to him and he said he said no sir. He
[56:47] said, "You're an atheist." He said,
[56:48] "Yes, sir." He said, "I bet you your
[56:50] grandpa
[56:51] wasn't." And he said, "How'd you know
[56:53] that?" And he said, "I bet you your
[56:55] grandpa was a man of God. Is that
[56:58] right?" He said, "Yes, sir, that is
[56:59] right. My grandpa was a
[57:02] preacher." And he began to show this.
[57:04] And he showed see there you're living
[57:07] off of the revival because that
[57:09] generation that blessing as God said I
[57:13] in gener to the second and third
[57:15] generation wasn't just a curse that I'll
[57:17] bring but I'll also bring a blessing
[57:19] that will pass down to the second and
[57:21] the third generation.
[57:24] And he said, "You're that goodness that
[57:26] you have is because of someone before
[57:29] you, a grandpa before you swed something
[57:32] in your life, and you're living off the
[57:33] benefits of that man's testimony."
[57:37] And he said, "And I want to tell you
[57:38] something, sir." He said, "Your children
[57:40] won't be like you." Because that was the
[57:42] end of that generation.
[57:45] And and it was so powerful when I
[57:47] thought about that because here we hear
[57:49] brother Brandon preaching this and he
[57:50] says, "History keeps repeating. You see
[57:52] revival. Now, I just want you to pause
[57:54] and think of that here just for a
[57:55] moment, friends. If that blessing of
[57:57] that revival can go three or four
[58:00] generations, where are we at?
[58:05] Where are we at?
[58:07] Hello. Just forgive me just as I find my
[58:10] find my note
[58:16] here. I thought it was so I think it's
[58:19] so amazing when you think about this.
[58:23] As brother Brandham says, thank you
[58:25] Lord. As brother Brandham says this
[58:28] here and he says in the fourth then God
[58:31] he says notice this then and God lights
[58:34] the fire again and the same process is
[58:39] repeated. The same process. Notice what
[58:42] he shows. And this is what I why I got
[58:43] this title the the the the autopsy of a
[58:46] dead revival. What are some of the
[58:48] signs?
[58:49] What was some of the revival killers?
[58:53] What was the
[58:54] evidences of that that third and fourth
[58:57] generation had waned
[58:59] out? You remember in the book of Judges
[59:02] how that even God brings a curse upon
[59:05] them because they didn't drive out all
[59:06] the Jebusites and the parizzites and the
[59:08] Hittites. And go read Judges chapter 1
[59:11] and the Bible says that ca that that the
[59:13] only ones who got victory was Caleb,
[59:15] right? and and the rest of them, but
[59:18] Manasseh and Benjamin and and Ephraim,
[59:20] the Bible would say it this way, did not
[59:22] drive out the Jebusites that inhabited
[59:24] Jerusalem. Anybody here remember that or
[59:26] do I need to read it? And it and it it
[59:29] shows how that they would get victory up
[59:31] to a certain point and then they would
[59:33] fall short of total victory. And it says
[59:36] then it would say, "And the Canaanites
[59:37] dwell in Jerusalem until this day,"
[59:39] meaning the day that it was written
[59:40] there. And and then the Bible says, "Now
[59:43] God comes to them. An angel of the Lord
[59:45] comes up from Gilgot of Bokeman and
[59:46] says, "I made you to go out of Egypt. I
[59:49] told you make no league with the
[59:50] inhabitants of this land, but you have
[59:52] not obeyed my voice." And he says, "Why
[59:54] have you done this? Nevertheless, I
[59:57] said, I will not drive them out from
[59:59] before you, but they shall becomes as
[1:00:00] thorns in your sides and pricks in your
[1:00:03] eyes, and shall vex you in the land
[1:00:05] wherein you dwell." And the Bible says
[1:00:06] that all of Israel lifted up their voice
[1:00:08] and they wept. But what's so amazing
[1:00:11] about that historical, if you read it in
[1:00:13] Judges 2, I'm just paraphrasing it for
[1:00:15] you here tonight to save time, is the
[1:00:17] Bible says, "So Joshua, the son of Nun,
[1:00:19] died. They buried him in the border of
[1:00:21] his inheritance." And it says, "And also
[1:00:24] all that
[1:00:26] generation that outlived
[1:00:29] Joshua were buried with him." And in
[1:00:32] other words, that curse that God
[1:00:36] pronounced upon them because they didn't
[1:00:38] have total victory never affected the
[1:00:42] generation who heard those words.
[1:00:46] But actually that entire generation
[1:00:48] dies, goes to their inheritance. And
[1:00:51] then the Bible says this. And then there
[1:00:54] arose another generation after them who
[1:00:58] knew not the Lord, nor yet the works
[1:01:01] which he had done for
[1:01:03] Egypt, had done for for Israel as he
[1:01:07] brought them out of Egypt. The Bible
[1:01:08] says there arose another generation who
[1:01:11] knew not the
[1:01:12] Lord. And it says they they they they
[1:01:14] they provoked the Lord to anger and
[1:01:17] serving other gods and Baal and Ash. And
[1:01:20] it's so incredible because it's like
[1:01:22] that great revival that came out of
[1:01:24] Egypt. And here they come and they cross
[1:01:26] Jordan and then they're going to go into
[1:01:28] the promised land. And here's here's the
[1:01:31] crescendo. Here's the here's every
[1:01:33] reason of why God even brought him out
[1:01:36] in the first place. He never brought him
[1:01:38] out in the wilderness to wander. He
[1:01:41] never brought them out into Canaan just
[1:01:43] to come up short.
[1:01:48] But yet they they come up short. And
[1:01:50] here's the great, you know, the great
[1:01:52] potential. And what do you have? You
[1:01:54] have a little bit of victory here. And
[1:01:56] yeah, Manasseh, he he the Bible says he
[1:01:59] drove them out in the mountain, but he
[1:02:01] could never drive them out of the
[1:02:02] valley, right? Because of iron chariots.
[1:02:05] I think it was Manasseh. And it gives
[1:02:07] reasons after each and every single one.
[1:02:09] They got victory here, but in this place
[1:02:11] and this place and this place and this
[1:02:12] place and this place, they never got
[1:02:14] victory. Amen. And because they allowed
[1:02:16] those gods to stay around them and
[1:02:19] rather than purge them out. Now those
[1:02:21] young people of that next generation,
[1:02:23] they never they never come under the
[1:02:26] same experience of the first revival and
[1:02:28] they rose up to not know the Lord at
[1:02:30] all. Nevertheless, Judges chapter 2, God
[1:02:34] raised them up judges. This is what
[1:02:36] brother Brandham is talking about when
[1:02:38] he says that he says that second gen
[1:02:40] generation uh uh I'm sorry here that
[1:02:42] second generation coming on was just
[1:02:44] like Israel that demanded the king to be
[1:02:46] like the other nations when they did
[1:02:47] that they rejected God but they did it
[1:02:49] anyway that is the history of the church
[1:02:52] and I stopped just to show you that in
[1:02:53] Patmas vision brother Brandham says that
[1:02:55] the Old Testament had seven church ages
[1:02:57] also in shadow of the gentile seven ages
[1:03:01] and how that that same process in judges
[1:03:03] would just repeat over and over. A judge
[1:03:06] would come, they'd serve the Lord. Judge
[1:03:08] would die, he would be buried, the
[1:03:11] revival would die, they'd go back to
[1:03:13] sin. Amen.
[1:03:16] I preached on it at brother Joe how
[1:03:18] shells for his meetings and how that it
[1:03:21] it always starts with sin and then sin
[1:03:25] always leads to
[1:03:28] slavery and then after they're enslaved
[1:03:31] to their sin, then they want to be set
[1:03:33] free, right? And so they cry out for a
[1:03:36] deliverance and they come to a level of
[1:03:39] repentance and God sends a judge. He
[1:03:42] delivers them. They set free and then
[1:03:46] that judge dies and then they go back to
[1:03:49] sin and they go back to slavery. Then
[1:03:52] they go back to crying out for
[1:03:54] deliverance. But each time it gets
[1:03:57] worse. As Jesus says, when an unclean
[1:04:00] spirit goes out of a man, it goes into
[1:04:02] dry places seeking rest. And when it
[1:04:04] cometh back, it find none. It comes
[1:04:06] back. It finds the house clean and
[1:04:07] swept. Right? So it's empty, but it's
[1:04:11] clean, but it's not filled.
[1:04:15] Amen. Do you know one of the most
[1:04:17] dangerous places you can ever get to is
[1:04:19] clean and empty.
[1:04:22] Amen.
[1:04:24] You would have been better off, Jesus
[1:04:26] said, you'd have been better off to
[1:04:27] never have heard. Hello. Yeah. So, one
[1:04:31] of the most dangerous places you can get
[1:04:33] to is that stage of justification,
[1:04:35] sanctification, and you stay there your
[1:04:38] entire life. And that varying degrees,
[1:04:40] as our my dad always uh preaches,
[1:04:43] varying degrees of sanctification. You
[1:04:45] stay in that spot. Spiritual amnesia
[1:04:47] after a while sets in because you've
[1:04:49] never really made a decision to really
[1:04:51] sell out.
[1:04:54] It's amazing. We have people in our
[1:04:55] churches in in in in this late is what I
[1:04:58] should say not in our church but in this
[1:04:59] late of a day people still living in
[1:05:02] that varying degree
[1:05:05] and then after a while they forget that
[1:05:07] they were purged from their
[1:05:09] sins and spiritual amnesia comes in and
[1:05:12] they're a believer they love the Lord
[1:05:14] you don't question that at all but
[1:05:16] really where is that where is that depth
[1:05:19] of that experience of that original
[1:05:21] flame and they never come to that true
[1:05:25] seal, which is what we're preaching on
[1:05:28] here tonight, that the the a revival
[1:05:31] killer. What kills a revival is that
[1:05:34] that genuine first experience, can I
[1:05:37] just let a prophet read it? Can we just
[1:05:39] read it? You you okay for me to read
[1:05:41] tonight?
[1:05:43] And he says that fervent desire to
[1:05:44] please God, the passion to know his
[1:05:46] word, the cry for reaching in the spirit
[1:05:48] begins to fade. The church has become
[1:05:50] formal. Quote off became formal. second
[1:05:52] generation. That's the history of the
[1:05:53] church. Long isn't long until you see
[1:05:55] them stop doing things they used to do.
[1:05:58] This is when death starts to set in and
[1:06:00] start doing things they wouldn't do
[1:06:02] initially. They change their manner of
[1:06:04] dress, their attitudes and their
[1:06:07] behavior. They get laxed. That's what
[1:06:09] Ephesus means. Relax drifting. That
[1:06:11] cycle of revival and death has never
[1:06:15] failed. Never.
[1:06:18] And so eventually they never press on.
[1:06:20] Can we go a little bit further here
[1:06:21] tonight?
[1:06:24] Listen to what brother Brandham says
[1:06:25] here. I want to just want to come back
[1:06:27] to where we were. Let me just get there.
[1:06:30] Nevertheless, the spirit of Rob and I,
[1:06:32] this is what we we
[1:06:34] covered on Sunday. I just want
[1:06:37] to make sure we get to the right
[1:06:41] place. I know it may seem like I'm
[1:06:43] jumping back and forth. That's because I
[1:06:46] am. But that's all right. This is how
[1:06:48] the Lord has me in this gear tonight. Uh
[1:06:51] this is what we read about uh when we
[1:06:53] talked about the preserves. You remember
[1:06:55] that? Now, I just heard a message
[1:06:57] Sunday. I I I I wanted to come back to
[1:06:59] this because the Lord just reminded me
[1:07:01] of it and I and I missed one of the most
[1:07:03] important parts of the point I was
[1:07:05] trying to make because you'll always
[1:07:08] find and I just feel led to to just to
[1:07:10] say this again though it's just
[1:07:11] repeating but I feel just the Holy
[1:07:13] Spirit stopping me right here. You'll
[1:07:16] always find that that's what brother
[1:07:18] Brandham I know preached on this here
[1:07:20] before, but that's what he was always
[1:07:23] contending against standing in the
[1:07:25] middle of is is the the he would say
[1:07:28] Armenius over here and then Calvinist
[1:07:32] over here and and brother Brandham says
[1:07:34] that whi which which one are you? And
[1:07:37] are you a Calvinist or Armenius? And
[1:07:39] brother Brandham says I'm both. I'm an
[1:07:40] Armenianist as long as he's in the
[1:07:42] Bible. I'm a Calvinist as long as he's
[1:07:44] in the Bible. Right. But the true word
[1:07:46] of God, the true bride of God goes down
[1:07:49] the middle of the road. And so he was he
[1:07:52] was he would preach against that that
[1:07:55] Pentecostal uh uh assemblies of God.
[1:07:58] Though they had the working of the
[1:07:59] manifestation of the spirit, though they
[1:08:02] had the blessings of God falling down in
[1:08:04] their
[1:08:05] meetings, yet he would come to this
[1:08:07] place where we just read out of
[1:08:09] remembering the Lord and he would say,
[1:08:11] "Are is that what we've got?" And I'm
[1:08:13] afraid sometimes, brethren, we just want
[1:08:16] the Holy Ghost for entertainment, but
[1:08:18] there's more to it than that. There's a
[1:08:21] life that's got to be lived behind that.
[1:08:24] It isn't that he was against the Holy
[1:08:26] Ghost blessings.
[1:08:29] But he came to show them there's
[1:08:30] something more than just shouting. Even
[1:08:33] brother Brandham in that message just a
[1:08:35] couple paragraphs later, he says,
[1:08:36] "Listen, I'm all for dancing. I'm all
[1:08:39] for shouting, but shouting isn't what
[1:08:42] you do when you come into the presence
[1:08:44] of God. All right.
[1:08:48] Did you say that right, brother Matt?
[1:08:50] I'm just quoting you what a prophet
[1:08:51] said. Shouting is not what you do when
[1:08:55] you come into the presence of God.
[1:09:00] And he says shouting is just the
[1:09:03] blessings falling.
[1:09:06] It's not that brother Brandon was
[1:09:07] against shouting.
[1:09:09] It's not that brother Brandon was
[1:09:10] against emotion.
[1:09:12] Anything without emotion is dead and
[1:09:16] ought to be buried. But there's got to
[1:09:18] be something further than just emotion.
[1:09:21] The prophet of God says when they came
[1:09:23] into the presence of God, they that the
[1:09:26] Isaiah would say you, Lord, I'm unclean.
[1:09:29] I'm undone. I'm unworthy. Lord, when
[1:09:32] they came into the true presence of God,
[1:09:34] it was that token light to where they
[1:09:36] wanted to be identified with their
[1:09:38] sacrifice. Listen, friends, as I said
[1:09:40] here before, and I'm just going to say
[1:09:41] it again, we we so many times we want to
[1:09:44] point back to some experience. And
[1:09:46] experiences are wonderful, but if we're
[1:09:48] going to point back to anything when we
[1:09:50] say the day that I met the Lord, I don't
[1:09:52] want to just point back to a time I got
[1:09:54] happy or a time I shouted or a time I
[1:09:57] felt goosebumps. That's wonderful. I
[1:09:59] want that more and more. And I love all
[1:10:01] of that, but I want to be able to point
[1:10:03] back to a moment to where I repented of
[1:10:06] my sins and God changed me from who I
[1:10:10] was to who I am today. That's the
[1:10:13] evidence of the true baptism of the Holy
[1:10:15] Ghost.
[1:10:19] Hello.
[1:10:21] Amen. And so, so listen, he was always
[1:10:24] he was never against shouting. Wasn't
[1:10:26] saying that shouting, well, we're in the
[1:10:28] presence of God, you better not shout.
[1:10:29] That's not what he was saying. Some
[1:10:31] would twist that up. He was simply
[1:10:33] trying to get a group of people who
[1:10:36] loved shouting, were emotional, love the
[1:10:38] pray, love the spirit of God
[1:10:40] moving, but they didn't want to bring
[1:10:43] their lives subject to the word that was
[1:10:47] spoken. Amen.
[1:10:49] Listen, he says here, I and I and I just
[1:10:52] reminded of this so much and the Lord
[1:10:55] brought this back to my memory because I
[1:10:57] I missed I clipped this quote on
[1:10:59] accident. I was trying to paste it and I
[1:11:01] realized I pasted over what what the
[1:11:03] point I was really trying to make. I
[1:11:05] just heard a message Sunday night from a
[1:11:06] brother to how we must confess our
[1:11:07] faults one to another and pray for one
[1:11:09] another we might be healed. quotes James
[1:11:11] 14 that we must confess our faults to
[1:11:14] one another before we even come for
[1:11:17] healing. Confess our faults one to
[1:11:19] another and pray one for another. See,
[1:11:22] that's just exactly what he was talking
[1:11:25] about tonight. Listen, he says this.
[1:11:27] Brings back the
[1:11:34] biatitudes. Brings back the
[1:11:38] biatitudes. Now, we we we've preached on
[1:11:41] it here before. You have all of the
[1:11:45] nature of
[1:11:47] Christ, all of the works of Christ.
[1:11:50] Listen, when you have the opening of the
[1:11:53] word, you have the opening of Christ.
[1:11:56] And if Christ has been opened, then all
[1:11:59] of himself is available to the church of
[1:12:02] the living God.
[1:12:04] Not just one part of it, but all of it.
[1:12:07] He says it brings back the
[1:12:09] biatitudes in with Mark 16.
[1:12:14] Blend that
[1:12:16] together. You got it. Then healings take
[1:12:21] place. Isn't that
[1:12:24] amazing? He says, "Blend that together,
[1:12:26] the biatitudes and Mark 16." What's he
[1:12:29] blending together? Not just the gifts of
[1:12:32] the lamb, but the nature of the lamb.
[1:12:35] Amen.
[1:12:36] And when you have the life, then you
[1:12:38] have power with character that's fit to
[1:12:42] rule.
[1:12:43] But the prophet says power without
[1:12:45] character is satanic,
[1:12:48] right?
[1:12:53] We don't we don't have much time, but I
[1:12:55] want to make sure I get to some of
[1:12:56] these. So, look at Jesus. Nothing but
[1:12:59] one bundle love. Let's go back to this
[1:13:01] word evidence because we we talked about
[1:13:03] this Sunday and we asked some of these
[1:13:06] questions here and I just expressed them
[1:13:08] in a thought and and just as the Lord
[1:13:10] was dealing with me throughout the week.
[1:13:12] What is the Holy Ghost? I'm going to go
[1:13:14] through them. What is it? What does it
[1:13:16] mean to be born again? Is receiving the
[1:13:18] Holy Ghost and being born again the same
[1:13:19] thing or are they two separate things?
[1:13:20] I'll just answer that question. They
[1:13:22] are, as the prophet says, the same
[1:13:24] thing. You you you find things Brother
[1:13:27] Brandham says previous to that. Yet in
[1:13:29] the brother Brandham says our triumphal
[1:13:31] capstone. He preaches this in the church
[1:13:33] ages. And he says what is the what is
[1:13:35] the new birth? It is to be born again
[1:13:39] and you not you're not converted. We
[1:13:41] read it Sunday. How many remember that
[1:13:42] you're not converted until you're born
[1:13:44] again? Are we born again different? Now
[1:13:47] we we come to this question. What is the
[1:13:51] evidence of the Holy Ghost? Listen to
[1:13:54] what brother Brandham says here in
[1:13:55] questions and answers. This is so here's
[1:13:57] our word evidence, an outward sign,
[1:14:00] something that furnishes proof,
[1:14:02] testimony. Dear brother Brandham, I've
[1:14:05] been baptized in Jesus name. The word
[1:14:07] says you shall receive the gift of the
[1:14:09] Holy Ghost. Does this mean the baptism,
[1:14:11] the Holy Spirit, or does it mean I
[1:14:13] should receive the gift? Definite. I
[1:14:16] should receive a definite experience
[1:14:18] with the baptism. I am anxious to be
[1:14:21] filled. Oh, if we could ever get people
[1:14:23] back to the spot this little person was.
[1:14:25] I am anxious to be
[1:14:27] filled. Hey, listen friends. I believe
[1:14:29] I'm born again and filled with the
[1:14:31] baptism of the Holy Ghost, but I'm here
[1:14:32] tonight to say I am anxious to be filled
[1:14:36] with all of the fullness of God. There's
[1:14:38] one filling, but there's many
[1:14:39] refillings.
[1:14:42] I'm anxious to be filled with the Holy
[1:14:44] with filled with the spirit. Please
[1:14:45] excuse the long note as I've been
[1:14:47] wanting to ask you this question for a
[1:14:48] long time now. The baptism, listen to
[1:14:51] this. I got to read it from my screen
[1:14:52] here because I have notes that go along
[1:14:54] with this and I want to make sure that I
[1:14:56] don't I don't miss them. And he says
[1:14:59] here, "Now the baptism with the Holy
[1:15:01] Spirit is," somebody say is. A definite
[1:15:06] say definite. I want to establish this
[1:15:09] clear. It is a
[1:15:13] definite experience.
[1:15:15] Amen. that a person must receive.
[1:15:21] The trouble goes to when we try to make
[1:15:23] everyone have a certain experience.
[1:15:31] Now, let me kind of clear that up just
[1:15:34] for a minute. Thank you, brother
[1:15:35] Brandham.
[1:15:37] See, how many people have the idea? I
[1:15:39] believe it's twisted. I do too,
[1:15:41] sometimes. And maybe right here in the
[1:15:43] church and the church that's listening,
[1:15:45] there might be a question when I speak
[1:15:46] of not believing the initial the initial
[1:15:49] evidence of the Holy Ghost is speaking
[1:15:50] with tongues. I do not accept that. I
[1:15:53] believe with God's help, I can prove it
[1:15:55] in the Bible that that's wrong because
[1:15:57] the speaking in tonesues is a gift of
[1:16:00] the Holy Ghost. Notice here, he never
[1:16:03] denied the gift of tongues. Can I get a
[1:16:06] hearty amen? He never said that it was
[1:16:09] no longer needed. Can I get a hearty
[1:16:10] amen?
[1:16:12] But in fact, he clearly stated or starts
[1:16:15] by saying the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:16:18] is a definite experience that a person
[1:16:21] must receive. How many knows that divine
[1:16:25] healing? He says, "How many knows that
[1:16:27] divine healing is a gift of the Holy
[1:16:29] Ghost?" Listen to this. I want to find
[1:16:31] my place here. Accept that. I believe.
[1:16:34] Thank you. Divine healing is a gift of
[1:16:36] the Holy Ghost. How many believe that?
[1:16:39] And here Beatles are doing it. Amen.
[1:16:44] Beatles. The
[1:16:46] Beatles. And here Beatles are doing it.
[1:16:49] Satan. I love this. I'm so glad for a
[1:16:52] word prophet.
[1:16:54] Satan can impersonate any of those
[1:16:59] gifts. Witches, wizards can speak in
[1:17:03] tongues and interpret. The jungles. Many
[1:17:06] times a wizard will speak in tongues,
[1:17:07] drink blood out of a human skull, and
[1:17:08] interpret unknown
[1:17:11] tongues. Again, let me just say this. He
[1:17:14] is not preaching that we don't need
[1:17:16] divine healing any longer,
[1:17:20] nor any other gift of the spirit. He is
[1:17:24] simply untwisting the idea that those
[1:17:27] things are an evidence of the sealing of
[1:17:30] the Holy Ghost when they are not. They
[1:17:32] are an evidence of the Holy Ghost.
[1:17:36] But they are not the evidence of the
[1:17:38] Holy Ghost.
[1:17:40] Just because you're healed doesn't mean
[1:17:42] that you're born again.
[1:17:46] As I heard just just a a brother, I
[1:17:48] think it was brother Ron Spencer saying
[1:17:49] that recently, one of the most I think
[1:17:51] it was one of the most miraculous
[1:17:53] healings he's ever witnessed take place
[1:17:55] was in a woman who didn't even I don't
[1:17:57] think I think she was a Christian,
[1:17:58] definitely not a believer, but didn't
[1:18:00] really serve the Lord. Right?
[1:18:03] And so notice this here. I'm just going
[1:18:05] to skip some of this because it's so
[1:18:07] long. I have could take you right within
[1:18:09] three or four hours from now where a
[1:18:12] medium will lay a pencil on a table, go
[1:18:14] into a trance, all kinds of things and
[1:18:15] wave their hands and that pencil will
[1:18:17] raise up and write in unknown tongues
[1:18:18] and the wizard will stand and tell you
[1:18:20] what it says. Now that's no evidence of
[1:18:24] the Holy Ghost. You can't rely upon
[1:18:28] that. I want to and I know it's going to
[1:18:30] become just just uh I'm berating the
[1:18:32] same point. I'm going to say it again.
[1:18:34] Once again, he is not saying the Holy
[1:18:37] Ghost does not speak in tongues or
[1:18:39] interpret unknown tongues. He's saying
[1:18:42] it's not an evidence that the individual
[1:18:45] operating the gift is sealed with the
[1:18:47] Holy Ghost. Amen.
[1:18:50] Well, then what can we rely on, brother
[1:18:53] Brandon? If we can't rely on an outward
[1:18:57] manifestation of the gift, what are we
[1:18:59] to rely on it? Well, maybe look, maybe
[1:19:01] the fruits of the spirit, maybe the
[1:19:05] biatitudes. You can't rely upon the
[1:19:08] fruit of the
[1:19:09] spirit because the fruit of the spirit
[1:19:12] is love. And the Christian science
[1:19:16] exercise, I love this, more love than
[1:19:19] anybody I know of. and they deny Jesus
[1:19:22] Christ being divine. Amen.
[1:19:27] There's only one evidence of the Holy
[1:19:30] Spirit that I know of and that is
[1:19:34] genuine faith
[1:19:36] in the promised word of the hour.
[1:19:41] Can I say something that is so simple
[1:19:43] but yet so profound?
[1:19:46] Just the fact that you have genuine
[1:19:49] faith in the promised word of the hour
[1:19:52] is a significant miracle that God has
[1:19:56] done in your life.
[1:19:58] Don't ever let if you now say, "Lord,
[1:20:00] what have you ever done for me? What
[1:20:02] have you ever done in your life? What
[1:20:03] has God ever done for you? What
[1:20:04] manifestation have you ever had?" You
[1:20:06] call yourself a Christian. Here's one
[1:20:07] thing. You ought to beat the devil from
[1:20:09] one side and down the other and say,
[1:20:11] "Satan, I believe the word, the genuine
[1:20:14] word of God, the promised word of this
[1:20:16] hour. I'm a believer, Satan, and I may
[1:20:20] never have any manifestation of some
[1:20:21] gift, but the greatest evidence that I'm
[1:20:24] truly born of the spirit of God is that
[1:20:27] I can believe a message, that I can
[1:20:29] believe a vindicated prophet, and the
[1:20:32] word that came in this hour, that's a
[1:20:34] miracle in and of itself.
[1:20:38] Oh, you ought to say amen.
[1:20:41] Here's the evidence of genuine faith.
[1:20:44] Now, what is genuine faith? True
[1:20:46] revelation
[1:20:47] and the promised word of the hour. What
[1:20:50] is Okay, here's the evidence. Notice
[1:20:53] this. Of the Holy Ghost, genuine faith,
[1:20:58] revelation in Christ for your day. The
[1:21:02] message of this hour. Amen. Amen. Listen
[1:21:05] what brother Brandham says. Those Jews
[1:21:06] come, they had more religion than the
[1:21:09] disciples. They were better trained men
[1:21:10] in scriptures than the disciples was
[1:21:12] because they were fishermen, tax
[1:21:13] collectors, so forth. They had real
[1:21:14] faith and genuine faith and what they
[1:21:17] were doing. Now listen closely. Don't
[1:21:19] miss this. When it come to being fruits
[1:21:22] of the spirit, kind,
[1:21:25] gentle. I guess there wasn't one of
[1:21:28] those priests. But what could outshine
[1:21:32] Jesus Christ?
[1:21:34] Amen.
[1:21:36] You call him kind and gentle. He was
[1:21:38] meek and lowly. But after his tri, what
[1:21:41] was his triumphal entry when he rides
[1:21:43] into Jerusalem on a donkey? The first
[1:21:46] order of business as he goes into the
[1:21:48] temple with a red raging fire in his
[1:21:51] eyes. The zeal of thine house has eaten
[1:21:53] me up. And he overturned the money
[1:21:56] tables. Took a whip and beat them out.
[1:21:58] But listen friends, this was God
[1:21:59] cleaning house. I believe that sometimes
[1:22:02] we ought to. I'm not talking about this
[1:22:03] church, but I'm saying this house right
[1:22:05] here. Sometimes we need that kind of
[1:22:07] zeal of the Lord to say, "Lord, turn
[1:22:10] over all the tables." If you've got to
[1:22:12] crack a whip on me, God, purge it all
[1:22:14] out of me, Jesus. Amen. And so, Brother
[1:22:18] Brandham says, "Those kind old priests
[1:22:20] had more were kinder, more gentle than
[1:22:22] even Jesus." Uh, he went into the
[1:22:25] temple, plated ropes, looked upon them
[1:22:27] with anger, turned over their tables,
[1:22:29] run them out of the place. Is that
[1:22:30] right? The Bible said he looked upon
[1:22:32] them with anger. The Bible said that's
[1:22:34] exactly right. See, those priests were
[1:22:37] gentle,
[1:22:38] meek, understanding men. Amen. When it
[1:22:42] come to the fruit of the spirit, they
[1:22:44] could show more fruits of the spirit
[1:22:47] than Jesus ever
[1:22:52] could. Is brother Brandham doing away
[1:22:56] with kind, meek, gentle
[1:23:01] He's not throwing no more. Can I just
[1:23:04] say no
[1:23:06] more than he is not throwing the gifts
[1:23:09] out of the church. He's also not
[1:23:11] throwing the fruits of the spirit out of
[1:23:13] the church. Gentleness, meekness,
[1:23:16] loving, brotherly kindness. That all has
[1:23:18] to be part of it.
[1:23:21] He is only pointing that they can't be
[1:23:24] used as the evidence. But just as the
[1:23:27] Holy Ghost will cause us to speak in
[1:23:29] tonesues and interpret and prophesy and
[1:23:32] that's listen I know we say tongues all
[1:23:33] the time. Listen friends do you know
[1:23:35] Paul said that is the least of the
[1:23:37] gifts.
[1:23:40] I I'm guilty of it. I'll be the first
[1:23:42] just to say that that's the first thing
[1:23:44] we go to. But there's more spiritual
[1:23:46] gifts. Nine spiritual gifts to the
[1:23:48] church. More than just one. The gift of
[1:23:51] wisdom, the gift of faith, the gift of
[1:23:53] miracles.
[1:23:54] They said there isn't just one. And I
[1:23:57] just want to say that was the problem
[1:23:58] with the assemblies of God. They camp
[1:24:01] down on one gift and they missed the
[1:24:05] giver of the gift.
[1:24:09] So So he's just as the Holy Ghost will
[1:24:12] cause to to to manifest in gifts, it
[1:24:15] will also produce the fruits of the
[1:24:17] spirit when it come because they failed.
[1:24:19] Listen to what brother Brandham says
[1:24:20] here. When it comes to theology, they
[1:24:22] didn't have a schol have a school that
[1:24:24] he come out of. Whence cometh this man.
[1:24:26] Where did he come from? What
[1:24:28] fellowship? Forgive me while I just I'm
[1:24:31] trying to find a note that I wrote down.
[1:24:33] Yes, I got it. Thank you, Lord. Amen.
[1:24:37] When it come to school, he come out of
[1:24:39] whence cometh this man. Where did he
[1:24:40] come from? What fellowship card does he
[1:24:42] have? What organization does he belong
[1:24:44] to? We don't know where he come from. He
[1:24:45] was just absolutely an outcast guy that
[1:24:48] was born an illegitimate birth. Why? We
[1:24:50] could down him here in a few minutes and
[1:24:52] show you by the laws. They had a right
[1:24:54] to do what they did when it come to
[1:24:56] that. Why? Because listen to this. They
[1:24:59] failed to see that he was the promised
[1:25:05] that promised word of the hour. Amen.
[1:25:08] The only way they recognized it when
[1:25:11] Jesus performed the word by being able
[1:25:13] to tell them what they had in their
[1:25:15] hearts, what they had been doing. He was
[1:25:18] a prophet according to the word of God.
[1:25:20] What he said come to pass. Every word,
[1:25:23] word by word. Listen to this. He,
[1:25:26] somebody say Jesus. He was God's
[1:25:29] prophet. Can we say amen to that? His
[1:25:31] servant, God. Listen, God's servant. God
[1:25:35] the prophet. It was before there before
[1:25:38] the prophet of God. And this is the God.
[1:25:41] The prophet, not the prophet of God. All
[1:25:43] right.
[1:25:45] That was Malachi, Jeremiah, Isaiah,
[1:25:48] Elijah,
[1:25:50] but this was God the prophet,
[1:25:53] not the prophet of God. You get it now?
[1:25:58] All the prophets that portrayed his life
[1:26:01] in portions played their part. But in
[1:26:04] him was the fullness of all the
[1:26:08] prophets. The prophets, the word of the
[1:26:10] Lord came to them, the prophets. But
[1:26:12] this was the word and the prophet, the
[1:26:16] same person.
[1:26:19] Now, when a man receives Christ in that
[1:26:22] manner, listen to
[1:26:23] this. When a man receives, we're talking
[1:26:26] about receiving the Holy Ghost here.
[1:26:28] Amen. When a man receives Christ in that
[1:26:34] manner that he is in. Aha. So, not just
[1:26:40] receiving Christ. Listen friends, I
[1:26:42] don't want you just to don't let this
[1:26:43] just become background music, especially
[1:26:45] young people. Listen
[1:26:47] close. When a man receives Christ in the
[1:26:52] manner that he is in,
[1:26:55] in other words, Christ revealed in your
[1:26:59] generation,
[1:27:01] not historically, but the word being
[1:27:04] revealed in your day.
[1:27:08] You can. And some of them say, "Well,
[1:27:10] I'm a Lutheran." Well, there's nothing
[1:27:11] against that, but the eagles don't feed
[1:27:13] on that. Amen. That was as far as it
[1:27:17] was. That was fresh food of that day.
[1:27:20] I'm a Wesleyan. That's all right. But
[1:27:23] you're living in the past. Those people
[1:27:25] said, "Why, we have Abraham." Let me
[1:27:27] find it here to to make sure I have it
[1:27:29] on my screen. We have Abraham, what our
[1:27:31] father, the prophet said. God's able to
[1:27:33] these stones to raise children of
[1:27:34] Abraham. See, we belong to this. We
[1:27:36] belong to that. that had nothing. He
[1:27:39] said, "You generation of snakes, who's
[1:27:41] warned you to flee from the wrath? Don't
[1:27:43] begin to say we have Abraham to our
[1:27:45] father cuz God's able of these stones to
[1:27:47] raise children to
[1:27:50] Abraham." So being a well-trained
[1:27:54] theologian had nothing to do with it.
[1:27:57] Being meek and gentle had nothing to do
[1:28:01] with it. What made him different? He was
[1:28:05] the word made flesh. Not the word for
[1:28:08] the day of Moses. Moses was that day.
[1:28:10] Not the word for the day of Noah. Noah
[1:28:12] was the word for his day. The word for
[1:28:14] the day of Elijah. Elijah was the word
[1:28:16] for that day. But he, somebody say this,
[1:28:18] was the present tense word
[1:28:24] and they were living in the back. And
[1:28:26] listen friends, you say, "Brother Matt,
[1:28:27] what are you preaching?" I'm preaching
[1:28:28] this. The same thing repeats.
[1:28:32] That's the evidence of the Holy Ghost
[1:28:34] when God reveals to you and you see it.
[1:28:38] Yeah. Thus sayaith the Lord and accept
[1:28:42] it not argue with it. Not debate it. Not
[1:28:46] question it. H well that part. Yes. That
[1:28:48] part not so sure. That part I believe
[1:28:50] thus say. I'm not so sure that applies
[1:28:53] over here. Listen friends. When you're
[1:28:55] really born of the spirit of God, you
[1:28:57] say I may not understand it. I may not
[1:28:59] be able to to explain it, but with all
[1:29:02] of my heart, brother, I believe every
[1:29:05] bit of it.
[1:29:07] Because why? I'm a believer.
[1:29:10] Amen.
[1:29:13] Not what you are, what you was, nothing
[1:29:15] about it. It's what God has done for
[1:29:17] you. There's the evidence. Jesus said he
[1:29:21] give us the evidence of the Holy Ghost.
[1:29:23] John 14, I have many things to tell you.
[1:29:25] I haven't got time to do it. But when
[1:29:27] the Holy Ghost comes, he will tell you,
[1:29:28] bring to your memory things that I told
[1:29:30] you about and will also show you things
[1:29:33] to come. Don't you see? There's the
[1:29:36] evidence. That's forthtelling. Having
[1:29:38] the divine
[1:29:39] interpretation of the written word.
[1:29:42] Amen. Isn't that the evidence of a
[1:29:44] prophet? A seer in the Bible is a man of
[1:29:46] God could tell forth and it be perfectly
[1:29:50] exactly, not somebody laid hands on him.
[1:29:53] That's a gift of a prophet. Listen
[1:29:55] friends, a prophet is predestinated,
[1:29:57] born to prophet. Yes. Amen. And his
[1:30:01] whole life he was a prophet. That's an
[1:30:02] office. Many of the questions on here as
[1:30:05] brother Adams point to the questions.
[1:30:06] When will the bride uh well will the
[1:30:09] bride be this? Will this? The church.
[1:30:11] And you can't divide what they are. The
[1:30:13] bride is the elected of God. The church
[1:30:17] goes through the tribulation. The bride
[1:30:18] doesn't. Amen. The bride is the elected
[1:30:21] of God. I I didn't have that, but I have
[1:30:24] it here. The Holy Spirit when it comes
[1:30:27] is a witness unto you that this word is
[1:30:32] right.
[1:30:34] Can you say amen, church?
[1:30:37] The word for today, not the word for
[1:30:40] Luther, the word, not for Moses. We
[1:30:42] witness it's the truth, but it's another
[1:30:45] day. What if Jesus would come and say,
[1:30:47] "Now, as Moses come talking to you out
[1:30:49] of Egypt, I've come taking you somewhere
[1:30:51] else." What? And this is brother
[1:30:52] Brandham saying this. What if Jesus
[1:30:54] would have preached Moses's message?
[1:30:55] He'd not
[1:30:56] qualified to he would he he have not
[1:30:59] qualified the Messiah. There you are.
[1:31:02] It's
[1:31:03] qualification. There you are. Yes, sir.
[1:31:06] First Corinthians 13. When that which is
[1:31:08] perfect is come, that which is in part
[1:31:11] shall be done away with. Listen to this.
[1:31:13] So all these little things of jumping up
[1:31:16] and down like a kid trying to talk in
[1:31:18] tongues and all these other things when
[1:31:20] that which is perfect and we do somebody
[1:31:22] say we do have today by God's help the
[1:31:26] perfect interpretation of the word with
[1:31:29] divine vindication
[1:31:33] then that which is in part is done away
[1:31:34] with when I was a child I spoke as a
[1:31:36] child understood as a child when become
[1:31:37] a man I put away childish things amen I
[1:31:39] go to preaching and then then don't get
[1:31:41] to these things Brother Brandham said,
[1:31:44] "Amen." Again, it's important, let me
[1:31:46] just bring this to a close, to rightly
[1:31:49] divide the word. Brother Brandham wasn't
[1:31:51] saying that we don't shout, that we
[1:31:53] don't jump, that we don't speak in
[1:31:55] tongues. It's not what he was preaching.
[1:32:00] Because if you try to preach that or
[1:32:02] teach that, you will find yourself log
[1:32:05] jammed later after this 1964 questions
[1:32:08] and answers. Yeah. when brother Brandham
[1:32:11] even on the we preached on Sunday even
[1:32:12] in leadership one of the last messages
[1:32:15] he preaches he's speaking about the
[1:32:17] manifestation of the gifts of the spirit
[1:32:19] amen so he's not saying that we're to do
[1:32:21] away with any of the gifts any of the
[1:32:23] manifestation he is saying it's not the
[1:32:26] qualification
[1:32:28] he shows that Jesus couldn't come
[1:32:30] preaching Moses' message or Noah's
[1:32:32] message he's showing that that
[1:32:34] Pentecostal Assemblies of God church
[1:32:36] using tongues as the evidence had been
[1:32:39] done away with. In other words, we've
[1:32:41] moved on past it.
[1:32:44] That which is perfect. What is perfect?
[1:32:46] Christ.
[1:32:49] Amen. And he says that Christ, the
[1:32:51] message of the hours, the divine
[1:32:53] vindication. Tongues have not been done
[1:32:54] away with. That's not what he's saying.
[1:32:56] This is just a rebuke to those who had
[1:33:00] used this evidence or these gifts as an
[1:33:02] evidence of the Holy Ghost. But they
[1:33:05] rejected Christ when he came in person.
[1:33:08] Amen. Because it was those same tongue
[1:33:12] talking, fire breathing, foot stomping,
[1:33:15] shouting, screaming life church in
[1:33:17] Shreveport, Louisiana. It was the same
[1:33:19] groups and uh uh that that that that
[1:33:22] fellowship with a lot of those
[1:33:23] Pentecostal churches that believed in
[1:33:25] all of those gifts, but denied the
[1:33:27] ministry of the son of man in brother
[1:33:30] Brandham's ministry
[1:33:32] and closed the doors to him. I just want
[1:33:36] to say I believe in talking in tongues.
[1:33:38] I believe in gifts. I believe in
[1:33:39] manifestations. I believe in the fruits
[1:33:41] of the spirit. But I just want to say I
[1:33:43] also believe that God has sent a message
[1:33:45] in this hour and I accept it with all of
[1:33:48] my heart. I believe it with all of my if
[1:33:51] anybody wants to identify themsel today.
[1:33:54] I'm identified with him. I'm identified
[1:33:57] with a message. I'm identified with what
[1:33:59] God did in this generation.
[1:34:03] Amen. Amen.
[1:34:06] Later. Later. I'm just going to close.
[1:34:08] I'm at 58 minutes. I've been keeping a
[1:34:10] timer.
[1:34:12] 58
[1:34:14] 25. Thank
[1:34:16] you. Later in that same sermon, if you
[1:34:19] want to say that he was doing away with
[1:34:21] gifts in that same sermon, Brother
[1:34:23] Brandham says, "Now, I believe in
[1:34:24] speaking in tongues." Here's just a
[1:34:26] little later. I believe in
[1:34:27] interpretation but it must be something
[1:34:30] directly to the church not the Lord's
[1:34:32] coming soon or which is all right but
[1:34:34] don't use vain repetitions Jesus said as
[1:34:36] heathens do now in here the these gifts
[1:34:40] got to be watched brother Brandham
[1:34:41] didn't come to do away with the gifts he
[1:34:43] came to put them in order
[1:34:47] have to watch it Satan can impersonate
[1:34:49] any gift look at the Beatles going not
[1:34:50] impersonate divine healing filthy dirty
[1:34:52] rotten born of hell he didn't say the
[1:34:55] gifts have to be put on a mantel or that
[1:34:56] that the gifts are have been done away
[1:34:58] with because now we have the perfect
[1:35:00] word. Brother Brandham never taught
[1:35:01] that. And even later in the tape, when a
[1:35:03] person asks when when a when and when
[1:35:05] asked if a person could be filled with
[1:35:07] the Holy Ghost and not have signs
[1:35:09] following here's brother Brandham's
[1:35:11] answer. If you're born a normal human
[1:35:15] being, you will actually do the things
[1:35:18] that a normal human being will do.
[1:35:24] I love simple simple. If you're born a
[1:35:28] human, you'll do what humans do. So,
[1:35:32] brother, if you're born a Christian,
[1:35:34] you'll do what they did in the book of
[1:35:36] Acts. It won't be any different. The
[1:35:38] same Holy Ghost they got is the same
[1:35:40] Holy Ghost here tonight. It'll produce
[1:35:42] the same people.
[1:35:48] You have to watch these things. I love
[1:35:49] this because a Christian I don't think I
[1:35:52] have this and that's all right. Yeah.
[1:35:56] And he says you have to watch this
[1:35:57] because a Christian takes up the habits
[1:36:01] of a Christian and they live like a
[1:36:04] Christian. These signs shall follow them
[1:36:06] that believe in my name. This is what
[1:36:09] the word of God says. They shall cast
[1:36:10] out devils. They shall take up serpents,
[1:36:13] drink deadly things. They shall You
[1:36:14] think we're just going around taking up
[1:36:16] serpents? That ain't what we do. We're
[1:36:17] not here to be a bunch of snake
[1:36:19] handlers. But brother, let me just say,
[1:36:20] if you get bit by a snake, there's a
[1:36:23] power inside of you. There's a blood
[1:36:24] inside of you that's richer than any
[1:36:27] venom of some snake or animal. And at
[1:36:29] the time of need, God can perform a
[1:36:31] miracle in your life. Doesn't matter
[1:36:34] what it is. There's power in this Holy
[1:36:36] Ghost.
[1:36:38] And he says they'll live. They'll speak
[1:36:39] with new tongues. And them, listen to
[1:36:42] this, signs, wonders, gifts,
[1:36:44] manifestations. Brother Brandham says
[1:36:46] they'll speak with new tongues. Them
[1:36:48] things just actually follows Christians.
[1:36:52] Amen. And when you're filled with the
[1:36:55] Holy
[1:36:57] Spirit, I wish so bad I would have had
[1:36:59] this and I didn't get
[1:37:03] it. I could say this one thing right
[1:37:06] here could just be the bow tie of
[1:37:09] everything I've said. When you're filled
[1:37:13] with the spirit, here's one of the best
[1:37:16] signs I know. You're so in love with
[1:37:21] Christ and believe every word that he
[1:37:25] says to be true.
[1:37:28] That's the evidence that you have the
[1:37:30] Holy Spirit. Your life's full of joy.
[1:37:33] And oh my, everything's different than
[1:37:38] what it used to be.
[1:37:41] That's the Holy Spirit.
[1:37:47] This is questions and answers. Same
[1:37:49] place. These gifts are in the Holy
[1:37:51] Spirit. If this congregation this
[1:37:53] morning just a nice snug
[1:37:56] church full, the overflow rooms course
[1:37:59] filled up, but in just notice if every
[1:38:03] person in here was in perfect harmony
[1:38:06] with the Holy Ghost. Amen. Every one of
[1:38:09] you was filled with the Holy Ghost and
[1:38:11] in harmony with the Holy Ghost, these
[1:38:13] signs would be just multiplying among
[1:38:16] you all the time. It be just constantly
[1:38:21] going. How many want constantly?
[1:38:26] Amen. But where there's confusion, where
[1:38:29] there's difference
[1:38:32] and where we set up, we set up
[1:38:34] different. I differ. I differ from that.
[1:38:37] no harmony. The Holy Spirit can't move
[1:38:39] itself. It can't operate through the
[1:38:44] people. I I tell you what, friends, I'll
[1:38:47] just say this right here. If if somebody
[1:38:49] wants to believe that brother Brandham
[1:38:50] came to do away with the gifts, then why
[1:38:52] is he talking about in the same sermon
[1:38:54] of those gifts constantly going, moving
[1:38:57] among you?
[1:38:59] Brother Brandham says, I I'll show you
[1:39:01] where God put them in. You show me where
[1:39:03] he took them out.
[1:39:06] But just as much as we don't believe
[1:39:08] that, I know that none of us believe
[1:39:09] that. We've we've got to come. Listen to
[1:39:12] what brother Adam says here. And I got
[1:39:14] I'm going to close on this. Don't try to
[1:39:16] have any sensation or anything to take
[1:39:18] the place of the Holy Spirit. When the
[1:39:21] new birth has come, you are changed. You
[1:39:24] don't have to do anything to prove it.
[1:39:27] Your life proves it as you walk. your
[1:39:32] love, peace, longsuffering, gentleness,
[1:39:35] meekness, patience. That's what you are.
[1:39:37] And the whole world, I want to say,
[1:39:39] Lord, let the whole world see the
[1:39:41] reflection of Jesus Christ in you.
[1:39:45] Speaking in tongues, he says, and all
[1:39:47] these shouting, that's just attributes
[1:39:50] that follow. Then, Lord, let me have
[1:39:52] those
[1:39:53] attributes. That's just the how many
[1:39:55] want that? Let me have those attributes.
[1:39:58] Desire. You say, "Brother Matt, are you
[1:39:59] telling us?" I'm telling you what the
[1:40:00] Apostle Paul says, desire spiritual
[1:40:02] gifts. That's the words of the Apostle
[1:40:05] Paul.
[1:40:06] That's just the attributes that follow
[1:40:08] this kind of life. And you can take an
[1:40:10] imperson any of those attributes and
[1:40:12] never have that life. How many know
[1:40:14] that's true?
[1:40:16] I could keep going and we're going to
[1:40:19] run out of time. You say, "Brother Matt,
[1:40:21] what do you believe this restoration
[1:40:23] is?" I'm going to read it to you as I
[1:40:26] wrote
[1:40:27] it. Musicians come
[1:40:30] Let's all stand.
[1:41:06] Listen to what brother Adam says here.
[1:41:08] And what is the Holy Ghost given for?
[1:41:10] just waited just for a moment to make
[1:41:12] sure we
[1:41:15] have and the minority to start
[1:41:18] with on the side of the alley out there
[1:41:22] with an old guitar. Think about that. No
[1:41:26] big church, no fancy choir, no grand
[1:41:30] pianos, no not even a building to gather
[1:41:34] in. just a little
[1:41:37] minority on the side of an alley with an
[1:41:41] old guitar and women couldn't even
[1:41:44] afford a pair of stockings
[1:41:46] laying out there on the railroad tracks
[1:41:48] picking up corn and mashing it, making
[1:41:50] bread for their
[1:41:51] kids. But what's it come to? He's
[1:41:55] talking about that Isuza revival. How it
[1:41:59] started and then how it
[1:42:02] dies and what's it come to? It was the
[1:42:06] most powerful standing church in the
[1:42:09] world today. Not in the eyes of men, not
[1:42:13] in the eyes of of the world, but in the
[1:42:15] eyes of God because he proves it by what
[1:42:19] he's doing for them. He's pouring
[1:42:21] himself into them.
[1:42:24] Pouring himself into
[1:42:27] them. And it was a Lutheran church that
[1:42:30] made the Wesleyan church. It was the
[1:42:33] Wesleyan church that made Pentecost. But
[1:42:36] Pentecost, what is it? It's a
[1:42:39] restoration of the same kind of grain
[1:42:41] that went into the ground at the
[1:42:43] beginning. Bringing back. Somebody say
[1:42:46] all.
[1:42:47] Bringing back all the fullness of the
[1:42:51] power of Pentecost by the baptism of the
[1:42:55] Holy Ghost.
[1:42:57] By the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Oh,
[1:42:59] the fullness of
[1:43:01] Pentecost. You say, "What do you believe
[1:43:03] it is, brother Matt?" I believe it's all
[1:43:05] of it. If we lack any part of it, if we
[1:43:09] failed to have the ferveny, the passion,
[1:43:12] the cry for reaching out in the spirit,
[1:43:14] we miss it, friends. And I just want to
[1:43:17] say, Lord, I don't want to miss it. I
[1:43:19] don't want to miss what you're doing
[1:43:20] because I believe God is doing something
[1:43:23] in this generation right now. And listen
[1:43:26] friend, let me just say we could whether
[1:43:29] we are ready or not, the Lord Jesus is
[1:43:31] coming. Whether whether whether whether
[1:43:34] you want him to, whether your life has
[1:43:36] been lived out, there's nothing that we
[1:43:38] can do to stop it. I just want to say,
[1:43:40] Lord, let me be ready.
[1:43:43] What is this restoration, brother Matt?
[1:43:45] It's all of the commands. Which command
[1:43:48] should the Holy Ghost produce in my
[1:43:50] life? Which one of the commands of
[1:43:51] Jesus? All of them.
[1:43:55] all of
[1:43:56] them. It's all of the commands of the
[1:43:58] gospels. It's what the Holy Ghost is.
[1:44:01] It's the biatitudes of Matthew 5. It's
[1:44:04] the seven pillars of wisdom of James
[1:44:08] chapter 3. It's the whole armor of God
[1:44:12] of Ephesians 6. It's all of the fruits
[1:44:15] of the spirit of Galatians 5. It's the
[1:44:18] virtues that second Peter 1 talks about.
[1:44:21] It's the gifts of the spirit that 1
[1:44:23] Corinthians 12 talks about. It's also
[1:44:25] the ministering gifts of prophets,
[1:44:27] apostles, pastors, evangelist.
[1:44:31] Amen. It's all of the gifts of Ephesians
[1:44:34] 4. What is it, brother Matt? It's the
[1:44:37] book of Acts, church and a
[1:44:40] continuation. He him Christ himself
[1:44:44] revealed in a many membered body. Lord,
[1:44:48] reveal yourself in this body. reveal
[1:44:50] yourself in me, Lord. If you can do
[1:44:52] anything, I just want to raise my hands,
[1:44:54] close my eyes, Lord, as I end this
[1:44:56] service tonight, say, "Lord, if there
[1:44:59] would be any of these signs of a revival
[1:45:01] that's dying, any of these signs of a
[1:45:03] spirit, Lord, maybe I've let it grow
[1:45:05] cold. Maybe I've let that fire grow
[1:45:07] cold, Lord. Maybe I've let that Lord
[1:45:11] that that fresh anointing, that fresh
[1:45:14] do, that
[1:45:15] fresh feeling, Lord, I can go back to
[1:45:19] the time when I first met you, Lord, and
[1:45:22] changed my whole life. I think of how
[1:45:25] the Lord of of uh just all of us, Lord,
[1:45:28] no doubt could go back as brother
[1:45:30] Brandham tells about that Ephesian age.
[1:45:32] They had lost the wonder of their
[1:45:35] message. They had lost somehow. Somehow
[1:45:39] it just became a
[1:45:41] tradition. What did they need? Your
[1:45:43] prophet said they needed to go back
[1:45:45] remember the Lord. Go back in memory. Go
[1:45:48] back to those first days. Go back to
[1:45:51] those first steps. Oh friends, we ought
[1:45:54] to do it tonight. We ought to go back
[1:45:55] down memory lane and say, "Lord, I take
[1:45:58] me back to my to the new again. Take me
[1:46:00] back to that place when I first knew
[1:46:03] you, Lord Jesus. Let that passion and
[1:46:06] that seal and that ferveny that once
[1:46:08] burned bright, let it burn in me again,
[1:46:12] Lord God. Let it burn from the head to
[1:46:15] the toes, Lord
[1:46:18] [Music]
[1:46:22] Jesus. Let others see it,
[1:46:25] God. Let it be a
[1:46:28] reflection of the work you've done in my
[1:46:33] life, Lord. May I reflect you in all
[1:46:36] that I do, all that I
[1:46:38] say, all that I believe,
[1:46:40] Lord, my daily actions. Lord, let it be
[1:46:44] a reflection that Jesus is alive, that
[1:46:48] he's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:46:52] forever.
[1:46:54] Amen. That's where it all starts, Lord.
[1:46:57] There'd be a cold heart here tonight.
[1:47:00] there'd be that heart that knows that
[1:47:04] this this Lord the sermon tonight Lord
[1:47:06] came right down their alley, right down
[1:47:08] their avenue, knocked on their
[1:47:11] door. I pray God that they would just
[1:47:13] come to the first step and that's open
[1:47:16] the door and let you in. You said if any
[1:47:20] man will open the door, behold I stand
[1:47:23] at the door and knock. any man hear my
[1:47:25] voice. It's one thing to hear his voice,
[1:47:28] but you got to open the
[1:47:30] door. And you said, "Lord, if they'll
[1:47:32] open the door, I'll come in and I'll
[1:47:36] suck with him." That means to have
[1:47:38] supper. That means to have communion.
[1:47:40] That means to have fellowship. Lord, I
[1:47:42] just invite any heart here tonight just
[1:47:44] to raise a hand and say, "Lord, I I've
[1:47:46] heard you knocking. I've heard your
[1:47:48] voice, but now I'm opening the door and
[1:47:50] I want to have communion with you one
[1:47:52] more time. Lord Jesus, I want you to
[1:47:54] feel welcome. Feel welcome, oh God.
[1:47:57] Lord, not not just in my not just in my
[1:48:00] speech, but let my life be a testimony.
[1:48:02] Let my actions, let it be a testimony of
[1:48:05] what I believe, not just from my lips,
[1:48:07] Lord, but let my whole life be a
[1:48:10] reflection that you've done something in
[1:48:12] my life. If that evidence is that
[1:48:14] there's been a change, then God, change
[1:48:17] me once again. Oh God, change me, Lord
[1:48:20] Jesus. I
[1:48:21] pray grant it. Now, brother Ken, you
[1:48:24] could sing whatever you're playing.
[1:48:26] [Music]
[1:48:30] Yes. Fire. Yes. Burn away. Burn away.
[1:48:36] Let's all gather together
[1:48:38] now. My desire for
[1:48:42] anything. For
[1:48:44] anything
[1:48:47] that you Turn, brother Ken. He's all
[1:48:51] love. It's all for the king. I want more
[1:48:55] of
[1:48:57] you and
[1:48:59] less
[1:49:05] me. Enter
[1:49:07] me. Lord into the
[1:49:10] [Music]
[1:49:17] Lord and
[1:49:21] feel
[1:49:23] [Music]
[1:49:25] me with
[1:49:29] you. With you. Can we sing it from the
[1:49:33] top? Holy fire. Sing that now. A holy
[1:49:37] fire. Let's raise our hands and sing it.
[1:49:40] Burn away.
[1:49:42] Oh, my desire. My
[1:49:45] desire for anything for
[1:49:49] anything that is not of
[1:49:54] you and is of me.
[1:49:59] I want more of
[1:50:02] you and less of
[1:50:07] [Music]
[1:50:14] me. Lord,
[1:50:18] empty me.
[1:50:21] [Music]
[1:50:26] Fill
[1:50:28] me
[1:50:30] with
[1:50:34] you. With
[1:50:39] [Music]
[1:50:44] you. Oh yeah.
[1:50:50] Lord me. Feel me? That's my prayer.
[1:50:55] Won't you
[1:50:58] feel
[1:51:00] [Music]
[1:51:02] me? With
[1:51:06] you. With
[1:51:08] you. With
[1:51:09] you. With
[1:51:13] you. With
[1:51:17] you. With you.
[1:51:22] with you.
[1:51:26] Is that your prayer, church? Let's give
[1:51:28] the Lord Jesus a hand clap of praise.
[1:51:30] Oh, give him a real fervent, passionate.
[1:51:33] Come on. Hallelujah. He's really worthy
[1:51:36] of it. Oh, yes. Yes, Lord. Amen.
[1:51:41] We don't have any prayer requests that I
[1:51:43] have written in. None that was turned
[1:51:44] in. Just making sure I didn't get any on
[1:51:46] the email. Nobody sent anything in.
[1:51:49] Anybody got in need? We didn't have any
[1:51:51] written down. Somebody want to make it
[1:51:52] known right now. Give you a second to do
[1:51:54] that. Uh, anybody here, brother?
[1:51:58] Nobody. All right. Sister Sarah, you're
[1:52:01] feeling better? I know you're here
[1:52:02] somewhere. Is she? She's still okay. Is
[1:52:04] she not here? Okay. Yeah. All right.
[1:52:07] Praise God. She's here. Amen.
[1:52:11] All right. Well, we have no prayer
[1:52:13] request, Brother Ken. Why don't we just
[1:52:15] pray? Amen. Would you put your hand over
[1:52:17] on that person? Amen. Maybe something
[1:52:19] that's
[1:52:21] even maybe that's no accident. Lord did
[1:52:23] it that way just for a reason. Join
[1:52:26] faith with somebody arm in arm, hand in
[1:52:28] hand. Lord, that's our true desire. From
[1:52:33] the bottom of our heart, Lord, empty us,
[1:52:37] Lord Jesus. The words to that song say,
[1:52:40] Lord, holy fire, burn away any desire,
[1:52:45] Lord, that would not be like you. I can
[1:52:48] hear the words of your prophet, Lord, as
[1:52:50] I heard them today. It's time we get
[1:52:52] serious. Really look into these things
[1:52:55] deeply as your word says. It's time to
[1:52:57] make our calling and election sure for
[1:53:00] our salvation are nearer now than when
[1:53:02] we first believed. Lord, we see it in
[1:53:05] the world. We see it in politics. We see
[1:53:07] it in the nations and nations at war.
[1:53:10] War with each other. It's never going to
[1:53:12] stop, Lord. There will be no peace until
[1:53:15] you return, Lord God. And we just raise
[1:53:18] hands today and say even so come Lord
[1:53:21] Jesus. This is a bride that's waiting
[1:53:24] waiting for her her love to return to
[1:53:28] take us all home Lord Jesus. A bride
[1:53:31] that's in readiness preparedness. The
[1:53:33] bride hath made herself ready. Lord
[1:53:36] we're looking in every crack in every
[1:53:38] corner. We're letting the light of the
[1:53:39] word of God shine down in every corner
[1:53:42] of our heart Lord Jesus. Lord, we didn't
[1:53:45] have any needs that were written, but
[1:53:47] but Lord, there's a great need, and
[1:53:49] that's our self. Lord, we present oursel
[1:53:52] as a living sacrifice now, Lord, on the
[1:53:55] altar before you. Bring back that
[1:53:57] passion. Bring back that zeal. Oh, that
[1:54:01] fire that once burned bright. Bring it,
[1:54:03] Lord Jesus. As we read in Leviticus, let
[1:54:06] it be a fire that's never put out, never
[1:54:09] grows cold. Oh Jesus, may we have Lord,
[1:54:14] if we need a fresh log to be thrown on
[1:54:16] the fire, then let it be thrown on my
[1:54:18] fire. Let it burn bright, Lord Jesus. As
[1:54:21] brother Steve's song says, Lord, don't
[1:54:23] let me be a lazy lightkeeper. Lord,
[1:54:25] where others can't find their way home,
[1:54:27] but let that fire burn. Let me go and
[1:54:30] clean the stool. Let me go and clean all
[1:54:33] of sin. Oh, wash me. Purge me
[1:54:35] thoroughly, Lord, as David said. Wash
[1:54:38] me, Lord God, that I might be clean.
[1:54:41] Create in me a clean heart. Renew that
[1:54:44] right spirit within me. Oh God, may I
[1:54:47] have that fire that burns deep, Lord.
[1:54:51] Lord, is this is the midnight
[1:54:53] hour. We've heard a cry, Lord, that's
[1:54:56] went forth. There will be a cry that
[1:54:58] says, "We have no oil in our vessel. Our
[1:55:01] oil is went out. Oh God, let it not be
[1:55:03] named among anybody in this church, not
[1:55:06] young, not old. Don't let anybody's on
[1:55:08] that day say my oil that I once had has
[1:55:11] ran out. But let us put Lord let us have
[1:55:14] a fire that's burning bright. Let it let
[1:55:16] the oil of the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:55:19] fresh be fresh upon our whole entire
[1:55:21] assembly Lord God. We want it Lord
[1:55:24] Jesus. We don't want to look, Lord God,
[1:55:26] at just something you did yesterday and
[1:55:28] something that's faded, Lord. But we
[1:55:30] need a fresh, as your prophet says,
[1:55:32] every generation gets a chance at
[1:55:34] revival, a fresh chance at the word. May
[1:55:38] we take advantage of it, Lord Jesus, we
[1:55:40] pray. We ask it in Jesus Christ's
[1:55:43] name. Amen. Let's sing it now. I
[1:55:48] [Music]
[1:55:49] surrender
[1:55:51] all to you.
[1:55:55] Everything
[1:55:56] [Music]

[2:00:54] away so

[2:00:59] me. Give him a praise. Give him a
[2:01:02] worship. He's
[2:01:04] worthy. Thank you, Lord God. Amen. We're
[2:01:08] going to let you go. If there'd be a
[2:01:09] testimony, something on somebody's
[2:01:10] heart, just raise your hand quick. If
[2:01:12] not, I'm just going to have be
[2:01:14] dismissed. We got a couple. So, I don't
[2:01:16] think that wireless. Is it working,
[2:01:18] brother Ken? Let me see it. Probably is.
[2:01:19] I think I turned it off. Brother M.
[2:01:21] Might be a low battery. So, we'll try
[2:01:24] it. Is it test? All right. It's low, but
[2:01:29] give that back to my
[2:01:32] memories. Just want to make a
[2:01:35] quick praying for little Phoebe. She's
[2:01:38] been feeding with a tube. You know, what
[2:01:41] is she now? Three weeks old, something
[2:01:43] like that. Well, They took it out and
[2:01:45] we're willing tomorrow she's been
[2:01:47] dismissed from the hospital. Praise the
[2:01:49] Lord. Praise God. Thank you, Jesus.
[2:01:52] Anybody else? Sister Rebecca,
[2:01:56] uh, was one over here or no? Okay,
[2:01:58] Sister Rebecca over here. Give that
[2:02:01] [Music]
[2:02:04] back. I'm going to make this quick, too.
[2:02:06] But I did promise that I would give this
[2:02:08] testimony. And first and foremost, our
[2:02:11] God is an ontime God. And um it's been a
[2:02:16] really long seven months. Um Brad hurt
[2:02:19] himself, you all know that. And probably
[2:02:22] about three weeks ago, he had to have
[2:02:24] another surgery um an
[2:02:27] angoplasty and to get the blood flow
[2:02:30] below his knee again. And he was in so
[2:02:34] much pain. Um I don't see Brad cry much,
[2:02:37] but he was crying. He was in a lot of
[2:02:39] pain. And that was on Monday. on
[2:02:42] Wednesday morning, he goes back, "You
[2:02:43] got to take me back." He goes,
[2:02:44] "Something's wrong." And so we went in
[2:02:47] there and she goes, "I think
[2:02:48] everything's okay." And he goes, "I
[2:02:51] think I need an antibiotics." And she
[2:02:53] said, "Okay, I'll give you an
[2:02:54] antibiotics, but and let me take a
[2:02:56] culture, but I I think you're okay." So,
[2:03:01] we had to go to Tennessee that next week
[2:03:02] for his uh cousin's funeral. And his
[2:03:06] foot was so swollen, but he sang and he
[2:03:10] spoke for his cousin. And we got back
[2:03:13] home and on that Tuesday, so this would
[2:03:15] have been two weeks ago. On that
[2:03:17] Tuesday, uh he got a phone call that
[2:03:19] that culture came back that he had staff
[2:03:21] infection and they wanted him to come um
[2:03:25] to get an X-ray to see if there was
[2:03:27] another infection in his bone. And I
[2:03:30] didn't even know when I looked at this
[2:03:32] if we were looking at bone again and
[2:03:35] maybe lose another toe, lose a foot. I
[2:03:38] really didn't know where we were at with
[2:03:39] it. It was that bad. And so I asked him
[2:03:44] um what were his what what did we need
[2:03:47] from these appointments? And he said,
[2:03:49] "Well, first the appointment tomorrow, I
[2:03:51] need to know that the blood flow is
[2:03:53] good. And on the appointment on
[2:03:55] Thursday, I need to know that there's no
[2:03:57] infection." Those were the two specific
[2:03:59] requests we had. So I wrote them down. I
[2:04:01] said it to brother Jason and a few other
[2:04:04] people. And on Wednesday when we walked
[2:04:07] in, the guy didn't even get out an
[2:04:09] ultrasound. He just touched his foot. He
[2:04:11] said, "Your blood flow is just perfect."
[2:04:12] And he said, "The wound is looking
[2:04:15] really good. That's not a bone you see.
[2:04:16] That's the whatever coming together. I
[2:04:18] don't even know what it is, but it's
[2:04:20] coming together." And so I didn't give a
[2:04:23] testimony that night because I told
[2:04:25] Brother Jason, I'm going to give it
[2:04:27] after we get the second prayer request,
[2:04:30] you know. And so we went in on Thursday
[2:04:34] and she walked in and she goes, "Okay,
[2:04:37] there's no infection. That's not your
[2:04:39] phone. And I have to say, I cried off
[2:04:43] and on the entire day because God is so
[2:04:47] amazing and he knew what we need when we
[2:04:49] needed it. And he's just on time and I'm
[2:04:52] thankful. That's my my praise. Amen.
[2:04:56] Praise the Lord.
[2:05:03] I don't want to sound repetitive on this
[2:05:04] about me with the accidents almost
[2:05:06] happening, what have you. on my way
[2:05:09] today. I think it was Forest Field, I
[2:05:12] think it was. A car came out and a
[2:05:13] little moped behind it. He came right
[2:05:16] out behind it. It's probably 8 feet
[2:05:18] before I hit him. And I got think, "Oh
[2:05:21] my, thank God he didn't." Then I got
[2:05:22] thinking later. No, thank God he didn't
[2:05:25] get hit. Yeah. Because if he wouldn't
[2:05:28] get hit, I'm going 50 miles an hour.
[2:05:30] He's pulling up. I would have hit him
[2:05:31] sideways. He would either would come up
[2:05:33] and over my car or under or something.
[2:05:35] And I thought, "No, Lord. Thank you that
[2:05:38] he made it. He just made it. That he
[2:05:40] didn't get killed or worse. Amen. Praise
[2:05:43] God.
[2:05:45] [Applause]
[2:05:48] Aren't you thankful for God's
[2:05:50] protection? He's always there. Amen.
[2:05:53] Angels. Amen. Guardian, guarding our
[2:05:56] life. Amen. Well, greet somebody. Just
[2:05:59] turn around and shake their hand. Tell
[2:06:01] them God bless you before we go. Brother
[2:06:03] Ken's going to sing something just as we
[2:06:05] go. Feel free to be dismissed at your
[2:06:07] own leisure. You want to stay in
[2:06:08] worship, that's all right. There's a
[2:06:10] good spirit of worship
[2:06:12] here. I
[2:06:15] believe you're my
[2:06:19] healer. I believe I
[2:06:23] believe you are all I
[2:06:31] need. Lord, I
[2:06:35] believe
[2:06:37] and I

[2:06:45] portion. I
[2:06:47] believe you're more than enough for me.

[2:07:01] need. I
[2:07:04] believe. You're my
[2:07:07] [Music]
[2:07:09] healer. I
[2:07:12] believe you are all I
[2:07:20] need. Lord, I believe.
[2:07:23] [Music]
[2:07:26] I

[2:07:32] [Music]
[2:07:33] portion. I
[2:07:36] believe you're more than enough for
[2:07:44] me. Jesus, you're all I need.
[2:07:50] [Music]
[2:07:57] You hold my
[2:08:00] every
[2:08:03] [Music]
[2:08:04] moment. You calm my
[2:08:08] rageing
[2:08:12] seas. You walk with me through fire.
[2:08:19] [Music]
[2:08:22] Heal all
[2:08:24] my
[2:08:28] disease. I
[2:08:31] trust
