[5:20] morning everyone God bless
[5:21] you let's
[5:25] stand go ahead and bring the PowerPoint
[5:27] up brother Mark
[5:29] we're going to start a
[5:31] new topic for Sunday school
[5:36] now so let's pray Heavenly Father we
[5:40] just want to commit this time to you
[5:42] Lord we pray that you would be glorified
[5:45] and magnified that you'd help me to step
[5:47] out of the way and that your anointed
[5:49] would come Lord and take your word and
[5:51] break it down to the people's hearts
[5:53] Lord and may the spirit of Revelation be
[5:56] activated in their hearts and in my
[5:58] heart as well Lord we Commit This Time
[6:00] To You For Your Glory we ask in Jesus
[6:02] name
[6:05] amen 1 Corinthians
[6:08] 117 for a man indeed ought not to cover
[6:11] his head for as much as he is the image
[6:13] and glory of God but the woman is the
[6:16] glory of the man may the Lord add the
[6:19] blessing to the reading of his word you
[6:20] can be
[6:22] seated brother brandham says that
[6:24] mothers are the
[6:26] backbone of the family and that is the
[6:30] truth amen we can see as in type that
[6:33] the reason this world hasn't been gone
[6:36] into full chaos under the wrath of God
[6:39] is that the bride is still here the
[6:42] scripture says he that lth will let
[6:44] until he be taken out of way of the way
[6:46] and then the man of sin will be revealed
[6:48] the son of predition who opposes and
[6:51] exalts himself above all that is called
[6:54] God or that is worship so he sits in the
[6:56] temple of God receiving worship so the
[6:58] the Antichrist will
[7:00] come only when the bride is taken out of
[7:03] the
[7:04] way so the bride there is then the
[7:08] backbone as brother brandham spoke about
[7:11] building a home we turning a corner
[7:13] where these different things that he
[7:15] speaks about the bride the bride being a
[7:19] type of the of the home in that sense so
[7:23] then what are fathers if mothers are the
[7:25] backbone what are fathers well fathers
[7:29] are to reflect
[7:31] Christ in the home and in the family so
[7:33] then fathers must be the
[7:36] foundation right the scripture says that
[7:40] no other Foundation can be laid than
[7:42] what is laid which is Jesus
[7:44] Christ and so of course it says we're
[7:47] built upon the foundation of the
[7:48] Apostles and Prophets but what's the
[7:50] foundation of the Apostles and Prophets
[7:52] Jesus
[7:53] Christ and so that's the foundation of
[7:56] the family that's what the home is built
[7:58] upon that's that's what the children who
[8:02] live in the home are built upon that's
[8:05] what they stand on top of so whatever
[8:08] whatever level the whatever layer that
[8:12] the husband lays whatever level of walk
[8:14] that he has that's the foundation that
[8:16] his family is going to walk upon that's
[8:19] the foundation that his home is going to
[8:22] be built
[8:23] upon so in a family then sons are to be
[8:28] in the family under preparation to be
[8:33] that
[8:34] Foundation under preparation the the
[8:37] vision isn't let's have fun let's get an
[8:40] education those things might go along
[8:42] with it but the the vision that fathers
[8:45] should be placing with their sons is
[8:47] you're going to be the foundation of a
[8:49] new home you're going to be a patriarch
[8:51] you're a patriarch in training that's
[8:54] your purpose that's what God has for you
[8:57] that's what God is doing for you so you
[8:59] need to find your life
[9:01] mission and that's what fathers should
[9:04] be preparing their sons to find is to
[9:07] find their life mission and we know
[9:10] specifically uh in general what a man's
[9:13] life mission is but secondarily as we
[9:16] all have a different calling within that
[9:18] General Mission and that General uh
[9:21] command to all believers so then
[9:25] daughters in the home should be under
[9:28] preparation
[9:29] to be a
[9:32] field right they should be in
[9:35] preparation to be mothers to be
[9:39] nurturers to be life
[9:42] multipliers remember brother brandham
[9:44] says the life comes from the father so
[9:47] the father plants the life but the
[9:50] mother grows the life and transforms it
[9:54] in multiplied for format right
[9:59] so on when we're looking at the hour
[10:01] that we're living in under the seventh
[10:03] seal it under the
[10:06] uttering of the seven Thunders that's to
[10:09] reveal all the mysteries of the word and
[10:12] it's to bring the restoration of the
[10:15] word in the hearts of the
[10:17] Believers so in that restoration it
[10:19] brings a Oneness between Christ and his
[10:23] bride so that those in the bride
[10:27] actually become a reflection
[10:29] of the vision and mind that Christ
[10:33] has she becomes the
[10:36] manifested glory of Christ our families
[10:41] need to be a reflection of that as well
[10:45] it's not good enough to just say that
[10:46] it's out in the world but it should be
[10:48] reflected within our families as we read
[10:51] woman is the glory of the man and the
[10:55] man is the glory of God so man then if
[10:59] we look at glory when you see Glory you
[11:02] should see of the
[11:04] manifestation of who that person is
[11:09] Right glory hearkens to manifestation we
[11:12] call it the shikina glory anytime we say
[11:16] the glory of God it's God manifesting
[11:20] himself in who he is so that he can be
[11:23] expressed and made visible and so when
[11:26] we say the man is the glory of God we're
[11:29] saying he's a reflection of the the the
[11:32] vision and the mind of God so then we
[11:36] translate that down the woman is the
[11:38] glory of the man so then the woman
[11:41] actually has to enter into the vision
[11:45] the mind the mission of the man so that
[11:50] he then be she then becomes an
[11:52] expression and a
[11:54] manifestation of the man the woman is
[11:58] the glory of the man the man is the
[12:01] glory of God it's the it's glory flowing
[12:04] down together they make the full image
[12:07] and likeness of God but it must flow
[12:10] down through that Vision we as the bride
[12:13] take the mind of Christ Christ doesn't
[12:16] take the mind of the
[12:18] Bride Christ doesn't follow his bride
[12:21] around waiting for her to give him a
[12:24] vision and an understanding of what to
[12:26] do no he himself
[12:29] has the understanding he himself has the
[12:33] vision and goes forward and walks in the
[12:36] vision and our
[12:39] wives need to take forth the mind the
[12:42] purpose the vision of their husband and
[12:45] become a reflection of
[12:48] that
[12:50] now what if what if the husband has no
[12:54] vision has no Mission well of course you
[12:57] you've you've exploded the whole thing
[12:59] to start with and the woman is going to
[13:01] make up her own vision and she's going
[13:04] to begin to resent the man for a lacking
[13:07] a vision and a mission right so the
[13:11] Bible says without a without the vision
[13:13] the people perish we understand that's
[13:16] speaking of the prophetic Ministry but
[13:18] even even taking it further we can
[13:21] understand that there should be a
[13:22] purpose there should be a reason there
[13:24] should be a function we have to get rid
[13:26] of our own vision and get God's vision
[13:30] and when we have God's vision for
[13:31] ourselves as men we can go forward in
[13:34] that Vision then your wife can respect
[13:36] you
[13:38] see a man's vision and Mission can't be
[13:43] his
[13:44] wife if if your whole vision of life and
[13:47] mission is life I'm going to find a wife
[13:49] I'm going to find a wife you're actually
[13:52] you're ending up in
[13:55] idolatry because the mission can't be
[13:57] the wife because then you're leading
[14:00] your wife into that vision and she's now
[14:03] making it all about
[14:05] herself now you've led her into idolatry
[14:09] this is uh the Magical World of Disney
[14:13] and Hollywood that makes the vision all
[14:16] about finding the
[14:18] girl well God God gave adam let's look
[14:23] to the beginning when God created Adam
[14:26] created Adam first what was the vision
[14:28] that he he gave adam a pre-existing
[14:32] Vision what was it take dominion and
[14:36] multiply well he doesn't have a problem
[14:38] taking dominion and subduing the Earth
[14:41] but he can't multiply by
[14:43] himself so what did God do he said this
[14:46] isn't good that man's alone I'll make
[14:49] him a help meat it speaks of both
[14:53] being the same and opposite at the at
[14:56] the same time she's the same but
[14:59] different why is she different she is to
[15:01] be the reflection she is to be able to
[15:04] help the man complete the vision and the
[15:07] mission that God has set forth for him
[15:10] now she now the man can really complete
[15:12] it because he has his
[15:14] helper right and so when he plants the
[15:17] life in his helper that's how
[15:19] multiplication can take place so a man
[15:22] can't multiply right a woman she's able
[15:27] to multiply with her husband a man can
[15:30] subdue a woman has a struggle to take
[15:33] dominion and subdue because she's the
[15:35] weaker
[15:36] vessel so now the man together with the
[15:39] woman they can complete the mission
[15:43] together the mission isn't each other
[15:46] the mission is to manifest God and to
[15:49] spread his Rule and dominion over the
[15:53] Earth First in the family and then
[15:57] beyond
[15:59] all right let me go back to my
[16:02] PowerPoint brother brandham speaking
[16:04] indoors indoors some time
[16:07] ago I read a story of the days of our
[16:09] Noble one of the greatest presidents I
[16:11] think the N Nation ever has had was
[16:13] Lincoln not because he come from
[16:15] Kentucky but because he was a great man
[16:18] he was deprived of an education but yet
[16:20] with something in his heart some purpose
[16:23] I like a man of vision I like people
[16:25] that got that's got something they're
[16:27] fighting for just not just lay around
[16:31] well whatever what comes along will be
[16:33] all right oh be up and at it and Lincoln
[16:36] never let his education stand in the way
[16:38] he had something to do I think every
[16:40] Christian ought to be that way find your
[16:42] purpose and go do it every member of
[16:45] this chapter just not well we have a bre
[16:48] breakfast once a month that isn't it or
[16:51] once every Saturday have a purpose in
[16:53] life something you're going to do God
[16:56] has placed you here do something about
[16:58] it every member of every Church there's
[16:59] a Revival in town the Revival is there
[17:01] for a purpose let's get something out of
[17:03] it let's do something about it when I he
[17:07] hear of a church this is from as as the
[17:09] eagle stirs or Nest when I hear of a
[17:11] church that hasn't got any ambition to
[17:13] grow there's something wrong with that
[17:14] church the Church of the Living God has
[17:16] a high ambition and another thing the
[17:19] Church of the Living God is built high
[17:21] because it's got high high anticipations
[17:23] and expectations say well we belong to
[17:26] the church Our Father served this church
[17:27] years ago that might be fine but the
[17:29] Church of the Living God can't sit still
[17:31] its Ambitions is to go higher and
[17:35] farther we see the blind healed today
[17:37] we're watching tomorrow for the dead to
[17:39] be raised we when we see nature obey his
[17:41] voice we're looking for the coming of
[17:43] Christ its Ambitions is high it's
[17:44] anticipations is high its expectations
[17:47] is high it's built high it's set up as a
[17:50] memorial the Christian at his work is
[17:52] set on a hill his Ambitions is high to
[17:54] win his boss or somebody else to Christ
[17:56] that's right his expectations is high
[17:59] somewhere that God will give him a
[18:00] chance to speak to somebody
[18:05] amen one
[18:07] more from a prisoner but before I say
[18:10] about Moses I'd like to make that
[18:13] statement that God always has to take
[18:14] any man that will serve him truly to be
[18:16] his prisoner a man has to surrender
[18:19] every ambition he's got everything that
[18:21] he is everything his life soul body will
[18:24] Ambitions and everything else and become
[18:27] a complete a prison to Christ who is the
[18:30] word to serve God Amen so our Ambitions
[18:35] have to be set High because God sets
[18:37] them high and he's called us to high
[18:39] Ambitions but it's not our own Vision
[18:43] it's not our own ambition it's entering
[18:46] into the vision ambition purpose mission
[18:50] that God has for us as individuals right
[18:53] back to the point I was making before so
[18:55] Adam came with a pre-existing mission
[18:59] unfortunately many of us we come and
[19:01] we're like I just want to get
[19:03] married I want a wife right good that's
[19:06] a good thing and then we figure then we
[19:09] we stumble along and then we have kids
[19:11] and we
[19:11] go I better figure this thing
[19:14] out what's my what's my mission what's
[19:17] my vision and frankly many men never
[19:20] figure it out and they're just carried
[19:22] along their wife carries them they like
[19:25] each other kind of and then they resent
[19:27] each other because the man's just flying
[19:29] foundering have have your vision and
[19:31] walk forward in that Vision if God
[19:34] hasn't shown you yet walk forward in
[19:36] what you're doing now and wait on him
[19:38] and he will show you he promised if you
[19:40] asked he would show
[19:42] you right so you come with the vision
[19:45] and a you know you you hear the you
[19:50] hear the perversion that women like a
[19:53] bad boy nice guys you know women don't
[19:57] like nice guys nice guys
[19:59] are simply begging them for a
[20:02] woman they're begging for a woman and
[20:04] she looks at and that and says what a
[20:07] that guy's weak guy don't have a vision
[20:10] he's not a manly
[20:12] man and the and the the bad boy he knows
[20:16] what he's doing he knows what he wants
[20:18] to do woman comes and he
[20:22] says I'm going to keep going on this
[20:25] Direction that's a perversion you see
[20:27] that women will do that because they
[20:29] want a man with a A Vision with a
[20:32] mission that he's already walking in but
[20:36] they they the real godly woman will see
[20:40] that and see the ungodly man she won't
[20:43] want that she'll want a Christian man
[20:46] with a real Vision to walk in see not
[20:50] not just saying oh I just you know I
[20:53] just want to I just want to find a wife
[20:55] that's all I want that's all I care
[20:56] about I just want to please my wife and
[20:58] everything
[21:01] okay you please God in everything you
[21:04] follow him and then God will set those
[21:07] things in order in the family because
[21:09] God tells you to love your wife even as
[21:11] Christ loved the church but when you put
[21:13] that first and you put that to a place
[21:15] of idolatry that's not the right Vision
[21:17] that's not the mission that Adam was
[21:19] given Adam wasn't given the mission to
[21:22] find a wife God found a wife for him
[21:26] right and and and Eve
[21:29] it's not your mission to go find a
[21:31] husband God will lead you to a
[21:34] husband God will open the door you let
[21:37] him direct you you let him guide you
[21:41] because you want his way and his purpose
[21:44] not your own purpose not your own mind
[21:46] not just because of he's cute or what
[21:51] whatever it is or because she's cute we
[21:54] were talking about we're living in a
[21:55] different we're living in the age that
[21:57] the seventh seal has been broken to us
[21:59] we're not living in denominational ages
[22:02] we're not living in baby ages we're to
[22:04] take the word and be mature in the word
[22:07] we're we're to be men and women of
[22:10] vision understanding what our purpose
[22:13] and what our place is in a word family
[22:16] all right now let's look at some
[22:22] statistics importance of a father
[22:25] fatherless homes produce in America 63%
[22:28] % of Youth suicides 71% of high school
[22:32] dropouts 90% of all homeless and runaway
[22:35] youth 85% of all children who show
[22:39] behavior disorders 71% of all pregnant
[22:45] teenagers recently uh a little meme was
[22:48] going around and they were asking uh
[22:53] homosexuals no homosexual has all five
[22:56] of these and they start good at math and
[22:58] they're like oh yeah I'm good at math a
[23:00] good relationship with their father and
[23:01] they went through hundreds of them none
[23:03] of them had good relationships with
[23:04] their father that's that's what that's
[23:08] what these people
[23:10] felt importance of a father that's
[23:14] involved continuing in the Faith of Our
[23:17] Fathers 90% of children remain faithful
[23:21] when their fathers truly walk with God
[23:23] regardless of mother and when it's just
[23:26] mother Walking with God less than 50% of
[23:29] children remain faithful to what they've
[23:32] been
[23:33] taught so we see that the father leading
[23:36] the family is the critical Foundation as
[23:39] I said as I said at the beginning the
[23:42] father leading the fa family
[23:44] consistently in the word with a vision
[23:48] of the mission that God has called him
[23:49] to do that is the place that your
[23:52] children will walk
[23:54] upon and again statistics are statistics
[23:58] nothing is a guarantee but we know when
[24:02] a father is involved when a father is
[24:05] connected when a father is leading his
[24:08] home the likelihood of children Walking
[24:11] with God is going to be very high
[24:15] amen very high very little chance of
[24:17] them walking away but without a vision
[24:20] with a husband
[24:22] that's not involved not connected not
[24:26] walking with God not leading his family
[24:28] in the
[24:29] word it's less than a 50%
[24:33] chance all right first
[24:35] Timothy
[24:37] 58 but if any provide not for his own
[24:40] and especially for those of his own
[24:42] house he has denied the faith and is
[24:45] worse than an Infidel it's interesting
[24:49] that the Apostle Paul would speak so
[24:53] rashly about this he
[24:56] he he he speaks in other places about
[25:00] women being in their place and if
[25:01] they're not in their place it's uh like
[25:04] saying that the word of God is being
[25:06] blasphemed amongst the people but here
[25:08] when he says a father that wouldn't
[25:11] provide for his
[25:12] own uh
[25:14] household as literally his life has
[25:17] denied the
[25:19] faith what his life is expressing is
[25:22] literally a denial of the word you it's
[25:26] just as I mean denying the faith that's
[25:28] when people would come for persecution
[25:30] they'd stand before Caesar worship the
[25:32] idol
[25:34] so to not providing for your own
[25:36] household is like offering incense to
[25:39] the emperor think about that so this is
[25:42] a critical thing in the Christian Life
[25:46] For Men is providing for their household
[25:50] and I'll say it's not just a financial
[25:53] thing providing for the home it's it's
[25:56] providing what God has has ordained and
[25:59] purposed for the family am it's
[26:03] providing spiritually it's providing
[26:07] financially it's providing emotionally
[26:10] physically etc etc to be that protector
[26:14] to be that Guardian to be that Keeper of
[26:18] the home and the family and to Sher that
[26:22] duty to run away from that Duty Paul
[26:25] says you're worse than an unbeliever
[26:26] you're an apostate
[26:31] wow how critical is that I don't know
[26:33] how to
[26:35] overemphasize this point I think it's
[26:37] key and critical for men to understand
[26:41] this it's not just about a job it's far
[26:44] beyond that a job is a job and providing
[26:47] for a family is the start it's just the
[26:50] start of
[26:53] it 1 Corinthians 1613 watch ye Stand
[26:57] Fast in the faith quit you like
[27:03] man be
[27:05] strong
[27:08] amen the word quit you like men is
[27:10] andrii it means to render Brave or manly
[27:14] to show or behave oneself like a
[27:19] man one of the key
[27:22] attributes of
[27:24] Manliness Godly a Godly Man is bravery
[27:28] he's not a he's not a wimp he's
[27:31] Brave he's ready to take the stand he's
[27:33] ready to take the punches he's ready to
[27:35] take the heat for his family he's not
[27:37] watching and cowering andh I don't I
[27:40] don't know what's going to
[27:42] happen uh behind the skirts of his wife
[27:45] but he's standing there taking the blows
[27:47] from the devil and from hell and from
[27:50] the enemy on the outside and he has to
[27:52] be
[27:55] strong strength is critical
[27:58] in manliness that is a very expression
[28:02] of what God created us to be is to be
[28:06] strong both spiritually and physically
[28:10] the the man is not to be the weaker
[28:13] vessel the man is the stronger vessel
[28:17] right the scripture declares that the
[28:20] woman is the weaker vessel I think
[28:21] that's one of the most obvious things
[28:23] that anyone that has eyes to see can
[28:26] acknowledge even though our society
[28:28] today would say men and women are
[28:29] exactly the
[28:33] same they're
[28:35] not and when women take the place of men
[28:38] in society it becomes a great danger for
[28:41] everyone
[28:43] amen it's it's totally wrong and I'm not
[28:47] going to comment about politics right
[28:49] now even though my brain is trying to
[28:52] force me
[28:54] to but that's the truth a woman in the
[28:56] pulpit
[28:58] she's not designed for that she's not
[29:01] designed to take the blows and the Bible
[29:03] says a woman is more easily deceived
[29:05] than a
[29:06] man so she's not designed for that but
[29:10] man is designed for that ma man isn't
[29:12] designed to
[29:14] multiply right he he can't do it on his
[29:18] own he has to have a helper to do that
[29:21] that's what his wife is for a man is not
[29:23] designed to be the nurturer of a home
[29:26] and of a family though the the the the
[29:29] wife a woman is designed to nurture and
[29:33] to help unify a family a man is designed
[29:36] to subdue to be strong to quit you like
[29:41] men be brave Joshua was told to be
[29:44] strong and courageous well in in our day
[29:47] and age we just put that off that's just
[29:49] spiritually strong well they flow into
[29:52] each other the guy was about to go fight
[29:54] a war I think he was talking about
[29:56] spiritual and physical strength strength
[29:59] take the strength that you have and give
[30:01] it to God and let him use
[30:04] it in First
[30:06] Corinthians
[30:08] 6 just refer to it 9- 11 Paul gives a
[30:14] list of things that will deny you entry
[30:18] to the kingdom of God and one of those
[30:22] lists of items is being
[30:24] effeminate men that are effeminate God
[30:27] hates it it's confusion it's even
[30:30] connected to what we've refer to for how
[30:32] you dress Deuteronomy
[30:35] 22:5 it's an Abomination to God for a
[30:38] man to dress like a woman and a woman to
[30:40] dress like a man how much more is it an
[30:43] Abomination for a man to act like a
[30:45] woman to act female to be
[30:50] sissified God hates it and he says
[30:53] unless you act unless you act like a man
[30:57] you're a provider you take
[30:58] responsibility men are designed to take
[31:02] responsibility for others and you'll
[31:04] never be happy and you'll never find
[31:06] meaning until you take responsibility
[31:09] for others God wants you taking
[31:12] responsibility for your wife for your
[31:14] sons for your daughters not to P you
[31:17] don't pass it off on the pastor you
[31:19] don't pass it off on the church you
[31:21] don't pass it off on the youth group you
[31:23] dad must lead and teach your family
[31:27] because because when you get old and you
[31:29] never took time to teach your family and
[31:31] to bring them the word and to show them
[31:33] what the message is and they walk away
[31:35] from all of it you can't blame your
[31:37] pastor your pastor is not going to eat
[31:39] the fruits of that your youth minister
[31:42] is not going to eat the fruits of that
[31:44] you are when you have grandkids and
[31:47] children scattered to the Four Winds of
[31:49] evil because you refuse to lead your
[31:52] home amen you refuse to teach them you
[31:55] refuse to take control
[31:58] you know
[32:01] it's I don't know how I want to close
[32:03] this out I I don't want to be lambasting
[32:06] you as as I close it out but let's put
[32:08] it this way Brothers we we have to
[32:12] realize that we have choices and
[32:15] decisions to make for our children you
[32:18] can't say well I don't know they're just
[32:20] they're they're just on social media too
[32:23] much well take their phone
[32:25] away take authority don't be a
[32:30] do what has to be done to save
[32:34] your
[32:35] family you are to be a redeemer you are
[32:38] to be a redeemer of your family take the
[32:41] authority that you have okay as they get
[32:43] older the things change and by the time
[32:46] they're 18 they should know how to take
[32:48] responsibility for themselves because
[32:50] you've shown them all through the years
[32:53] am and they're gradually getting more
[32:56] reliable and more spiritual ual
[32:58] responsibility but I'll remind you sorry
[33:01] Gideon that it your brain is not fully
[33:03] formed until you're 25 so your decision
[33:06] making is
[33:07] poor up until
[33:12] 25 so if you're not 25 yet probably
[33:15] should get some help from your
[33:17] father in your decision making first
[33:21] your heavenly father and then your
[33:23] Earthly father not just you Gideon it's
[33:25] all it's every one of us it was me when
[33:28] I was a dumb 24 year
[33:30] old and I can say see with perspective
[33:33] and I can say that that's the
[33:36] truth I was growing and
[33:40] learning that's why they uh insurance
[33:43] companies make your insurance go down
[33:45] when you turn
[33:48] 25 but the point is is we we can't just
[33:52] push the responsibility off or be so
[33:54] sissified that we don't take control and
[33:57] Leadership over our
[33:59] families and we can't leave the
[34:01] leadership to our wives because our your
[34:03] wife will resent you for not taking the
[34:07] leadership for not making the decisions
[34:09] she'll hate that so you think well I'm
[34:12] just empowering my wife oh you're a
[34:14] great feminist God bless
[34:16] you you're not empowering your wife
[34:18] you're ruining her you're hurting her
[34:21] you're damaging her you're ruining your
[34:23] own marriage because you refuse to be a
[34:26] man
[34:29] and a word
[34:30] family their head is is Christ first and
[34:36] then the
[34:37] man and secondarily is no no one else
[34:41] should insert themselves between this
[34:44] relationship between husband and wife
[34:47] the pastor is not the head of any wife
[34:50] in the church the husband is the head of
[34:55] the wife and when a when pastors we've
[34:58] stories are replete with it of nickan
[35:01] spirits and it always targets the women
[35:04] it controls the women and then the women
[35:06] control the men in the church and it's a
[35:08] perversion and it's wrong a healthy
[35:10] church is made up of Healthy Families a
[35:14] good pastor equips the husbands to lead
[35:17] their families a good Minister helps
[35:20] them be equipped to properly lead their
[35:24] homes and take headship over their
[35:26] families so that everything is order in
[35:29] order so a healthy church is made up of
[35:32] Healthy
[35:33] Families a pastor that inserts himself
[35:36] between these relationships the church
[35:39] becomes
[35:40] sick so sick homes produce sick
[35:44] churches because it's out of
[35:46] order many time sometimes the pastor
[35:49] think he's doing something right because
[35:51] the husband is a cissified man that will
[35:53] not lead his family so he thinks well
[35:55] I'll go help lead his family well you're
[35:58] doing wrong by that
