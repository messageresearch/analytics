have anybody to pay my room and board i would have to take care of myself i was 22 years old so i went to madagan and i went to a charismatic church for four sundays and on the fourth sunday sitting there and the man asked it was a charismatic church and i like this it was called the eagle's nest and i was just sitting there and everybody bowed their heads and if you want to give your heart to jesus but as i was sitting there it just felt like he was sitting there looking at me i wasn't looking at anybody else i was just a marine party animal type of thing and i just knew he was watching me and i just decided yes i'll serve him so then it was everybody had to sit up and all you that raised your hand come on up front well between me and him i knew the decision that i decided by his grace to make and i went up front i was the first one a big clap i never went back to that church again soon after that i met some marine brothers that were going to tucson tabernacle but from that moment on we sang that song he touched me my life has never been the same i've never gone away from god i've i've had issues backslid or just not serve them like i could had a troubled church past where we were but from that moment on it was a decision he honored my decision and he never let me slip away it can be that easy you know just a moment in time and and i'm 61 that was 22 39 years ago and it

[Applause] [Music] of love hallelujah [Music] you love the lord god bless you this evening greece in the name of the lord i want to go right into the word of god to first timothy chapter 6 and i just want to say how much i appreciate it uh all of that singing and those specials were particularly wonderful for me both of them for personal reasons and i just um boy i was just an almost raptured amen it's amazing when you hear the lord talk to you in song and and the word and you know for me the way i'm built i suppose um i i have such a confidence in god's word since a child that for me the greatest thing god can ever ever do for me when he wants to tell me something is show it to me in his word because then as i have perfect faith there's no doubt i have i i would face uh i would face a thousand man army to take a stand by myself because i know that this is god's word and i know that god has sent us the opening of this word in the hour that we live and i have a 100 percent confidence in god's word amen and so i realize that no man can know this book takes the spirit to reveal it it took god anointing a messenger to open this word to us friends and make it live because that's really what its purpose is as i've been saying to you a lot of late that the goal of this book is to not need this book not not in this life you're going to need that you're going to need this book until you go but he's not rapturing this he's rapturing you because you are becoming this in flesh form amen don't get me wrong we need this absolutely until the lord calls us home every day when i go into this book i find new insight and things that i had not put together previously so i just stand here before you today exceptionally grateful to the lord for the word that he has given us in this day amen it is life to me it's all i care about amen in this world i have forsaken all other pursuits i realize that nothing i have the functions of living of course i do i'm not so heavenly minded that i'm no earthly good i still live here i'm still you know still doing like you still paying bills and still meeting needs and uh you know but but i realized that this world is not my home in its present condition and i'm looking for uh a new one amen who's builder and maker is god amen imagine that a realm with no contamination of anything fallen no contamination whatever god bless you first timothy chapter 6 and we'll catch verses 9 through and then brothers you can go straight um there's my little beauty queen back there again tonight okay z you can give me my powerpoint oh i'm gonna definitely be smiling at you all night so you can give my powerpoint after honey wait wait till you get till we get the scripture done and then you go straight to my to the um title screen i think i said slide 14 i believe in the email that's where we're going to need to start first timothy chapter 6 verse 9 amen but they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare and into many foolish and hurtful lusts which drowned men in destruction and perdition you'd read that verse you think nobody would chase this world's riches but almost everybody does it seems like i said some years ago said it seems like everybody wants to be the thing jesus said would be almost impossible to go to heaven amen but i'm i want to broaden your mind tonight we're we're going to be talking a lot more than about a lot more than the almighty dollar for the love of money is the root of all evil which while some coveted after they have erred from the faith and pierced themselves through with many sorrows but thou o man of god flee these things and follow after righteousness godliness faith love patience meekness fight the good fight of faith lay i mean listen at this list i i think that if you if you look at verses 11 and 12 you realize that the principle the apostle is laying down is way more than just currency and money amen it's the pursuit of the world and all things attached to it and paul is just using this one example worldly riches that's one example but he's contrasting it with a a whole litany of of of things to that you should pursue he says fight the good fight of faith lay hold in that amazing lay hold on eternal life i thought i had it already but you've got to lay hold on it see all right whereunto thou art also called and has professed a good profession before many witnesses so god is not going to be satisfied for you just to have your eternal life and rest on your laurels that god has given you that eternal life to maximize its effect in your life amen your he he your your eternal life want to say that again is the source by which god is looking for excellence in you in in all things in godliness in righteousness in faith in love in meekness uh fighting the good fight of faith laying hold on eternal life this is what your eternal life is the fuel for you see to to pursue all of this list at the expense of chasing the world i want to tell you today you'll have a much better deal if you chase this and stop chasing the world amen you have a much better life you'll accomplish so much more for god you have you'll have so much more joy peace and happiness and contentment and the devil hates you more and that's an awesome thing it's wonderful wonderful wonderful amen let's pray father we thank you for your word as we already feel your teaching spirit upon us lord and we're eager now to go into the word and see what all you have to say lord i have many things here before me that i felt you wanted to say to this audience tonight you you said it to me lord for several days now and you've said it to me all through this day lord and i i've had no rest because your voice has been steadily speaking to me lord on this approach that i want to take tonight it's been strange and i i want to testify to this church of the strange movings lord and so i pray for your anointing upon me in jesus name amen god bless you friends you can be seated amen praise the lord all right z so if you give me slide 14 honey i think that's pretty sure that's where i want to start yes awesome okay so we are in approaching perfection part two and i want to just pick up two quotes that we took from sunday because we're carrying on in this theme tonight and if you remember sunday we were speaking a lot about the type that melchizedek uh king of salem a man priest of the most high god and uh how what his life was pretending for you and i it was a type it was it was something that god wasn't going to stay right there god was going to continue to unfold and remember you don't hear any more about him because he advanced he became jesus christ amen and jesus advanced he advanced oh absolutely he became for he went from one to 120 in a moment and then he went from 120 to 4 thousand and then he went from there and from there and from there and they went house to house and throughout all the world and here we are today the continuation of the advancement of god's unfolding amen i know it's wednesday but i hope you came ready all right here's something we read god in morphe masked in the pillar of fire god in more faith now look this is this is the advancement this is the going forward i'm referring to god in more faith masking the pillar of fire amen above above the children of israel fire by day amen cloud by night right god in morphe and a man called jesus that's an advance right god in morphe in his that's in advance you see god above us god with us god in us the condescending of god all right now since god doesn't do anything without a purpose then you have to admit he's in you for a purpose amen all right and that's what the bible has been it has been a work of god that's been covered up and it's been hid since the foundation of the world and its seven-fold mystery and god promised in this day at the age of this laodicean church he would take the mask off the whole thing and we could see it what a glorious thing now now let me let me just speak about this quote all right there is there is nothing in this quote or any quote to to suggest that our understanding is or will ever be greater than elijah of our day and there is nothing in this quote or any quote to suggest that the elijah of our day had a greater understanding of god than saint paul i defy that that notion there is no such thing there is not a doctrine that we believe that is not based on the foundation paul's laid clearly there's nothing you can find william branham teaching that's not established in paul's doctrine and that's what he stood on on the other side saying i only ever said what paul said and the millions said we're resting on that amen now all right now granted granted this at the family of god is is predestinated to go further in our development than that alpha age did because paul was moving them toward a body change they never got there they fell away that's what seven mysteries are all about they fell away it went into the ages christ can't come back in that age to get his bride he has to sit down in the eternities intercede for ignorance seal up the word in seven seals but he promised in the last day he would unseal it all and he would bring back the message of the hour and the bride would start feeding on that and he clips that first age all the way to a body change you say my goodness we they had such a book of acts we don't see seem to see that i'm here to tell you friends don't put god in that kind of a box just because you don't think you have a certain kind of a thing happening or this kind of thing happening i'm here to tell you this is the bride that's going to be changed in the body we're going to while we're alive without dying amen you understand so the word of god is is is is already doing more in you right now than you're even aware of amen say why do you say that so often because you need to have confidence in that that god because this age more than any other age uh before or since uh has the ability to discourage this bride to say why do i even try i have just so many weaknesses and so many failures well let me tell you something let me give you a little bit of help with that you've got you've only got the same weaknesses and failures that every age had only you're living in an age that's about a million times worse so give yourself a little bit of slack here and to say by his grace i am what i am and he's living in me and he's moving in my life and i'm going to keep pressing on because i know that some morning the trumpet of god will sound the dead in christ will rise and i will be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye take that devil hallelujah so we are there is that sense of we are further than they were just don't try to get it to where you where you're suggesting because that's the error that that has been in the within our ranks where oh we we've got another rung on the ladder we're we're higher where i've had preachers look me in the eye when i when they brought a doctrine that contradicted what brother branham taught in 1965 and they says well when he when i when he couldn't wiggle out because i don't i don't confront someone unless i know where i'm standing and when i confront you understand i come loaded and when i confronted him and he had nowhere to move left right over under he looked me dead in the eye and said brother we are further along than william branham i said we are done we are done there is no need to have any more discussion right we can still be pals but we are finished in this discussion there's nothing else for me to say if that's what you believe god bless you but i will never accept that i i certainly believe i am lacking in manifestation but you're not gonna tell me that this message isn't complete you're not gonna tell me that a prophet didn't finish his course and i have everything that i need in this hour in order to bring a seed gene to god and bring it forward to a body change i don't need an eighth messenger i don't need another super we're not to chase supers see we have we have a message and and you know it's amazing to me that everybody wants to go beyond it nobody's even acknowledging what god has done the ones that always want to go beyond it that's the the one thing i see about them constantly and very often times they have the teachings of william branham but they don't even have the same spirit william branham had and so i want something that lives friends i'm not i'm not impressed at all by high octane preaching that that'll entertain me for about 10 or 15 minutes but if you ain't got something to say and if i can't see the power of god moving i'm here to tell you i'm looking for another source because i believe this word has power in it hallelujah i believe it it can change the hearts of people and not just puff us up with pride and knowledge make us message theologians back to my notes when we look at um at these verses i i think that with the wickedness seen in the you know in the repeating of the days of noah and the days of sodom you know pressing on the door as it were like they did there in genesis they were pushing and pressing on the door and we find that that's the spirit of that sodom spirit today it literally wants to press its way into the schools and press its way into the government press its way into your home press its way into how your children are taught press its way into churches and liberal all-inclusive thinking that that does away with the line of demarcation that god clearly puts between his family and everybody else god doesn't divide on racial lines he doesn't divide on economic lines but god does divide on the line of his word hallelujah and and and we are a separate people not because we're better or made ourselves separate but because we have we have been called out if it's not a separating message why call out of her my people why not just stay in there and be ecumenical see that's much more politically correct ecumenic ecumenicalism is much more politically correct but it's also the mark of the beast that's why it's going to fool so many but i think friends that you would agree with me tonight that with the days of knowing the days of sodom that we see pressing upon our everyday life there's there's never been a time for the family of god uh where verses 9 and 10 have a more um imposing reality an imposing reality that that the whole world is just you know the love of money and the root of evil and men are drowning in perdition and and snares of the enemy and foolish and lustful hurtful lust abound and there's every kind of thing there's every kind you say i don't really have a pursuit to be rich you think the devil don't know exactly what you have a pursuit of and i'm here to tell you everything other than this he is trying to give you that and block this i want you to understand young people the devil has been watching you since the day you were born he knows what he knows what buttons to push he knows how you tick he knows what your goals are and what will turn you on and he will do anything he can to keep the pursuit of this out of your life and you'll find yourself with these men of verse 9 who drown in destruction and perdition one of the leading causes of spiritual death is drowning in destruction and perdition when i look at verse 11 to 12 you know conversely the bride then in contrast to nine and ten the bride has never seen i would suggest you tonight that we have this bride as a collective global body has never seen the necessity of verse 11 and 12 become more important but thou o man of god flee these things and don't just flee follow after righteousness it's not just well i just won't do anything evil you will if you don't pursue righteousness you you turn on a treadmill one time and step on it and don't walk the world is sliding off a cliff and if you stop going forward you go backwards if you're just standing still say i'm a pretty good guy i'm not in all kinds of stuff but if you're standing still in your spirituality if you've allowed leo to see it to arrest your advance and spirituality you're going backwards see and you won't you might not notice it till you flip on the when you go off the end of it see so we've never seen something more important as fleeing these things and following after righteousness godliness faith love patience meekness following after these things see fight the good fight of faith lay hold on eternal life you know there's something to be said and i i said it i read you the quote in fact i don't have it tonight just trying to cut as much out as i could to save some time but i i read you a quote where brother branham was talking about too often times you know we we want god to just make us into the perfect person we loathe ourselves and we just want god to fix us see and and and brother branham has said there's some things he will not do he's waiting on you to do it see here's some of them fight the good fight of faith lay hold on eternal life whereunto thou art called and has professed a good profession before many witnesses in other words lay hold on eternal life to the level that god predestinated you to lay hold on eternal life to the level that that you have the potential to be down on the inside of you this is an age for excellence the bible says in the last days the people that know their god will do great exploits see it's amazing that this term o man of god it's interesting you don't find that you'll find it only in the old testament actually this is the only time in the new testament that it's carried over and and it's used only right here in in timothy in the new testament because the title describes one who stands for god faithfully against opposition as a spiritual leader or as an example to all believers now this is including all of us because we're all whether you're in a spiritual leadership role you're all an example to the world amen you're an example to one another an example to your family and therefore this man of god term is applying to all of us paul's not just saying timothy i need you to do these things but hey you people in buford 2000 years from now you don't need to worry about it this is just for timothy no no see and so we find that the the spirit is speaking expressly then through saint paul to connect the shadow in the old testament of thou mann of god to a as i've been saying since i started to an advancement to a further fulfillment when you look in the old testament everything you see is shadow you understand it the very fact that it was shadow then says to you it will have a fulfillment because if there was no deep to respond there would be no deep to call you understand so the very fact that he in the old testament he used the term man of god proves there's going to be people of god not not just a man man-made prophet like elijah moses going through the wilderness but all the people all of them will have the spirit of god dwelling down inside of them amen now so we find then that that when he calls him oh man of god you know it's it reminds me of when we preached on the series you know what is the church of god i've had so much feedback on that series it's a lengthy series longer than most and you know it's it's it's like it much in the same way that paul is saying to timothy oh thou man of god almost like to me it's like paul when he said to the corinthian church that that they were the church of god i mean you know hear this bethel tabernacle you are part of the church of god let me remind you of that lest you have forgotten already you are part of the church of god hallelujah that that that that must put a responsibility upon us see so you want to let that be more than a denominational idea to you see otherwise i mean if you if you don't if if if i say to you bethel tabernacle you are part of the church of god and that really to you is just a title a cliche i mean it's it's just a uh uh i'm not saying you think that we're denomination but denominationalism is a is an idea it's a way of thinking and as long as it's you know it's just some kind of man-made you know we've got this title where bethel tabernacle paul called us the church of god if if if to you that it's not more than just a denominational idea then then you literally take this gospel that jesus said when this gospel is preached into all the world and what was that this gospel what was that this gospel the word made flesh the word made flesh that's the gospel he was referring to so no wonder it had to come at the last day of the ministry of the son of man under 21st century ability to take and live in people's lives around the globe and this gospel is being repeated the word made flesh in people's lives but when you look at it as just knowledge or education or a church that's just where i go then that's just a denominational idea of thinking and you literally you you you literally make this the the gospel of this word made flesh you make it into a man-made thing see this is why we are told paul said to the hebrews in the 12th chapter looking unto jesus catch catch the description he's the author and the finisher see of our faith so so it so he's the author and the finisher what he was in the first age he's finishing that way that's what the message is about friends that that's exactly what we have come to in this hour is that that gospel is now this gospel and he's the author and the finisher you're living in the hour of the finisher see and so all his word then is to be on display in the last day like the first day that's why they wrote a book of acts and brother baton said when this bride when this bride tree puts forth another branch it'll write another book of acts behind it bear in mind that the chronicles you read in in the book of acts i mean the book of acts was written because people acted amen you understand it became a chronicle of events it's not a book the doctrine though it teaches doctrine but the book of acts was written because people acted and that's exactly what's incumbent upon us today we're here acting out the finishing part to prove to the world that he is he really is no kidding the same yesterday today and forever and we can prove it because he lives in our lives and conducts himself the same way in us as he did the early church see and so so then we come to this so here i i highlighted these because these are action words but thou o man of god flee amen flee these things and follow after and fight the good fight and lay hold which one of these words do you read vacation are these passive words or active words they're active words because perfect faith is active not passive you understand it's taking god at his word and going forward see because perfect faith has to become manifested it's not just a human faith but we've had that you do have that but brother and son i'm trying to bring you a perfect faith this is a revealed faith that causes you to move causes you to act upon it see because then because then it's a revelation so none of these are passive and if and if you're living your christian life passively i feel so sorry for you no wonder you don't have the victory that you see others have and want to have but think you can't have and you've got the same gene seed of god they've got and you serve the same master they serve and god loves you just as much as he loves them but why is it we we we have too much you know passive way about us i think i think when it comes to fighting the devil we're pacifist i'm a pacifist in the in spiritual warfare you're a pacifist you're gonna get killed your family's going to get killed everything around you is going to burn down and say why because the enemy will burn it down if you don't fight him you're going to have to take the land and you're going to have to defeat the enemy and you're going to have to hold the ground that god gives you and not back up this is not passive warfare god hasn't doesn't have an army full of pacifists we are hard charging soldiers of the cross we have no armor for our backside we have a shield of faith and a helmet of salvation and a sword of the spirit and a breastplate and feet shod with the preparation of the gospel and the sound is a battle cry charge see so it's all his word on display in these last days like it was the first day but in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver but also of wood and of earth and some to honor and some to dishonor you ready if a man therefore wait for god to purge him from these he shall be a vessel unto honor how many want to be a vessel and honor well he's not promising you that god will purge him he's saying if a man therefore purge himself of these see he shall be a vessel unto honor sanctified and meet for the master's use lord god in heaven i have no other desire in my life than to be in use for the master hallelujah and prepared unto every good work all right so so but in a in a great house verse 20 there are not only vessels of gold so so if a man therefore purge himself from these he shall be a vessel and honor sanctified and meet for the master's use and prepared under every good work flee there's an active word for you flee also youthful lust run why do i need to run because it's going to kill you it's poisonous and it'll work on your natural body and your mind and fill you full of so much stuff you'll find yourself captive to it see flee youthful lust you get me you get me you're with me i can feel that you're with me you're we're going in the same direction here flee also youthful us not pray for an overcoming magic spell but follow righteousness faith charity peace with them that call on the lord out of a pure heart to see the things the lord is doing among us can i just get a little personal tonight is that all right it's a wednesday night kind of open up my heart tell you how the lord's been dealing with me that'd be all right say brother jason what makes you tick i'm gonna just tell you a few things that make me tick you know to see the things the lord is doing among us and you know i mean just just if we speak in in human terms i mean growing our numbers of families and this assembly um that's one and don't think that that's not on my mind i i've even my my my ministry team and i have said you know we've got families we've already got new families and we've got more families coming and i'm going to tell you something brothers and you ask them i've told them i said we need to get ahead of this we need to be ahead of this because the enemy is not going to take that sitting down and we need to make sure we're working on the line and order of god's word have i said it brothers i've said it over and over brothers we're going to have to be ahead of this because because satan's not going to take it laying down and we're going to have to make sure that we can stand on the promises of god see and so you know we have we have all felt the tremendous anointing in our services our our fellowship i thought about some of these things today as i was just jotting down some thoughts from my mind our fellowship after the services the extended fellowship that we have in our homes i i saw some videos the other night and believers just sitting around strumming guitars and singing and worshiping you say oh yeah that's what we we do in a church they weren't in a church they were in a home and and you've got people gathering and praying and and you know the lord has been pouring out his spirit moving in our families amen bethel tabernacle moving in our families moving in our married couples moving upon the heart of our young people and our number of baptisms recently has been increasing and and and i and i can i can say to you personally that that i that i have felt a strong a strong or a surging strength and and strong tide like a like like a tide rolling in for the opening of the word i can't even stay abreast of it i can't even keep up i just sit in my office and my mind is blown every day every day every day i'm here to tell you god is gathering up his family hallelujah we're we're on the home stretch friends hallelujah amen all things trending upward and i felt so challenged in my spirit i just confessed to you when i see these things i i have i have felt so challenged in my spirit say brother jason almost seems like these things are stressing you out they're not stressing me out at all in fact as part of my dilemmas i'm i don't feel stressed and i wonder if i should i wonder i'm worried that i don't seem to have anything to worry about and that worries me we have plenty to worry about don't worry about that but just on a personal note as i see these things i have very recently you know over the last year or so i don't know maybe it was the thing that happened with the near-death experience you know fourth time in my life i came probably shouldn't be here enemy trying to take me out several times over my life and this most recent one was the fourth time but i'm still here and i'm gonna keep going and i know that until the lord is done with me i am immortal hallelujah but i i feel so challenged in my spirit say to what brother jason and it's hard to describe i spent all afternoon just staring at my screen trying to figure out how to say what's in my heart but but but the simplest way i can express it is just to feel a challenge in my spirit to to empty out more see two two you say well i thought i would think that you would want to start climbing spiritual well you have to empty first that's the problem you have to empty because he'll only be in you what you brother branham said what you empty out and make room for him and if you limped it out he'll come in and fill that space see but he's not going to live in an overcrowded cell he he he's going to have you empty out the world so that he can come in and fill that place back up again don't worry you won't be empty you'll just be full of better things hallelujah empty more of anything that even has a chance for satan to lessen my spiritual life and i suppose if i would have stress it would be that i don't seem to be keeping pace as fast as i feel like i want to does that make sense can i be just transparent with you tonight i'm just a man like you and i have i'm liking you know like we're all like elijah we have them we're men and like passions brother branham said that many had his ups and downs we have bright days and rainy days good days and bad days don't we friends we have days when you just feel like you feel like elijah's standing there calling down fire and then you feel like elijah hiding in a cave see but to empty out more and more of anything that even has a chance uh for satan to lessen somehow lessen or water down my spiritual life i have wondered you know at a recent seemingly strange thing seemingly it's not i found out it's not i found out it's actually part of the word perfectly but because i wasn't aware of that it seemed odd to me and i questioned whether it was even right and i went to the lord in prayer now you remember i gave you the testimony at the beginning of the service that for the lord to show me anything if he shows it to me in his word that for me that is that's a rest then i can just let off the pressure ah there it is in the word devil you lying dog it was in the word all the time you're trying to make me feel stressed and i didn't even need to feel stressed i had the word of god to assure me but i've wondered at a recent seemingly strange thing working in my life i've had a deepening question about feeling like perhaps i could be taking god for granted somehow and i you know i and i'll just the only way to do it is just to kind of give you some examples but you know last week was a very taxing week for me ministry-wise because i'm i i'm in a i'm in a call-in bible study every day 365 and i love it it's tiring and and sometimes at least once or twice a week i'm the lead teacher and then every other day i'm one of the lead commentators following up behind the teacher and so it's every morning and i i i revel in it i love it it's been one of the most enriching things in my life but you know i've i've and and so so come last week then turns out that that that some brothers in another church in another state uh where i was ministering and they asked me said brother jason you know we heard you do this thing every day i said yeah i said you know we meet every friday with a team of brothers and we sit around with coffee in our bibles and we have a little bible study and we're would you would you mind coming on and just you know have a have a little fellowship with us around i said sure absolutely i love studying preaching i love teaching the bible it's one of my favorite things in the world to do and i and i and so so consequently then i had i was scheduled to speak in my bible study that i'm on the call in it's national it's all the way to the west coast and even other places in the world and and so they i was scheduled for that friday to teach and so i quickly i jumped in i jumped in whatsapp and i said hey we have a team of brothers i said can anybody swap with me and i saw brother david samuel said hey brother david you're you're scheduled for sunday i'm scheduled for friday and saturday back to back by the tim put me back to back services and i said can i i'll handle sunday for you you take friday for me sure brother jason brother david gentlemen that he is be happy to do that brother and so he jumped in on friday there in my place while i was with these brothers at a another assembly out in the west and and and so i here i am you know in a lengthy bible study on friday and then i got to jump right up out of the gate saturday morning go right back into another call in bible study and then and then sunday i had a double header because i had to now cover brother david's sunday service and then leave there and rush to church and come here and preach to you and so by sunday afternoon i got home i told my wife i said my goodness i feel like i've run a four-day revival my mind is so tired and and she said you bet you love it and i said that you're right i do and i said i'm not complaining i said it's a good feel it's a good tired feeling but but i'll be honest with you you know when i when i came to church when i was coming and i i was just praying and said lord you know my mind by the time i finished three friday morning saturday morning sunday morning and now it's time to come here and preach my main sermon to you i felt very tired all i had plenty of notes i'd done tons of study i was totally ready to go i'm sure sunday reflected that but mentally i was very tired and i was just saying and i said in my heart i said but lord you know you just always come on the scene and i just don't have to worry because i just know you will and then i thought to myself ah there's that nagging feeling again you remember brother branham got a nagging feeling like that he couldn't figure out what it's coming from and he thought lord have i done something and he he went for a long time trying to figure it out and he prayed and that's where he went in you know and saw that deer and the lord said you kept you remembered your promise yes he said i'll keep my promise too it was a great deliverance for brother branham and it's been wearing on me because because my ministry schedule i'm ministering every day of my life and it can get so tiring but then i but then i sometimes i think to myself it's all right i'll be fine because even if i go in unprepared the lord will just come in on the scene and those are usually the best sermons and services is when i don't even hardly can't even figure out and i i was comforting myself because i'd i'd seen the message where brother brandon would say he'd come to the plot where he'd say well he said they they called for me to come out here and he said my goodness i haven't even opened my bible and he said and brother neville said brother brandon we'd love to have you taken they started singing he said so i just i just ran by and grabbed my bible and out the door i went he said and he said now he said i don't even know where to turn he said let's just start at john 1 1. he said let's just see what the lord will say and here's a prophet of the age that vulnerable but i'm glad he was he was transparent like that helps me but i i just felt like lord this is this this goes back to that whole thing again i'm not emptying out enough i'm i and and i'm and i'm always with that weakness of trying to say i want to do more and i want to do one i remember god keeps saying i just need you to be more i need you to be more you know don't don't just you do the be and i'll do the doing and i'm constantly having to correct myself on that because i have i'm caloric and that's my nature and i hard charge and and it's like i just got to take that's why i never could train people with with painting they just had to learn it by true by trick or hook or crook and and trial and error because i i'm trying to train somebody and say now just okay paint it i mean no no i mean stop give me that here just here go go go clean those brushes up i'll just do this and it's just too much ocd and and and so i'm i'm just always charging ahead hard like that and and so if the slightest little thing i i can fall under such conviction and say my goodness lord what am i what's more of my time and and i you know i and i and i you know i yet yet god you know yet god did as he always does every time listen friends if i said it any other way i'd be lying every time i come to the pulpit he's there whether i feel prepared unprepared he's there well i feel tired or fresh he's there whether i've even got problems i'm dealing with he's there you know why because this is his word and you're his bride and this is his plan and i'm constantly reminding myself i'm just his assistant it's not even on me and but you know just fighting that battle just fighting i'm just confessing and fighting that battle and it even happened over this last weekend but here he come and i went to sleep sunday night and i had that question in my mind lord am i just am i taking you for granted i mean it feels like i'm just taking you for granted i woke up monday morning is this okay i woke up monday morning and i had a good friend come on my mind brother mark coffey this brother barry's brother lives up in newfoundland i think and uh wonderful brother me and him have worked together on this whole study of the book of revelation that we're creating uh brother jd's helping me put together a um a study guide for the entire first by verse entire book of revelation been working on it for a year and a half and we're just getting started collating it now and brother mark has been so instrumental in that and he came on my mind when i woke up monday morning i thought that's brother mark in my mind i wonder what he's up to i should probably call him haven't talked to him in a while and so i'm just feeling tired i told sister debbie i said honey you know can i just like lay in the bed this morning and i said i overslept you know i probably didn't wake up till seven and i'm still laying there and and she's like well i gotta make this i gotta make this bet so you can have to hurry never mind [Laughter] but amen paul made her the house manager so there's nothing i can do about it the wife guides the house guides the home that's what paul said so so that's her domain so uh that was a great break when i was raising boys asking me my boys they'd come to me hey dad can we i'm like that's mom's department not my problem go talk to mom oh well mom don't want to i said what mom say she don't want to do it i said okay what do you think i can do about it this is mom's department you know i can't she's my manager i can't overrule her like that and so uh we'd take it outside and so so here i am that's that's a little plug for you sisters you should be saying amen don't give him sore ribs though just say amen and he'll get the message um so when when a woman says get out of my kitchen that's yet scripture that's bible amen and so so so i i said hey can i just lay here for a little bit and i she said well for a little bit and so i i'm always up early i'm way up early ahead of her and so this morning i was tired from that long for service revival meeting and i and i i open up my laptop and boom there's an email guess who it's from i'll bet you can guess it's from mark coffey it's like wow that's a little spooky but so i opened it up and brother mark is commenting to me he's actually listening now and he was commenting me brother jason your series on i think it was uh uh what what is the church series and he was saying oh particularly you know this that number eight and number nine and then there was a song at the end of number eight brother andrew had sung and oh my goodness it sounds so awesome i immediately sent it to matt hey you need to get this on our podcast right away said dad it's already it's already on my list you only move it to the top i said move it to the top that's a good one and so so so i'm i just start reading his email and he just he sent me this this quote and it's from 1959 bomb and gilead now you already know how i went to bed you already know the burden on my mind the one thing that we have to move up to now is a supreme faith to what we have had something that you cannot have that faith until you know perfectly what you're doing when you understand like you you walk you just say well i'm going home i'm going out to start the car that's all an act of faith tomorrow i'll meet you at a certain place that's all an act of faith because you've just done it so much because it's a regular routine with you well that's the way the things of god are after you have trusted him and watched him do so many things till it becomes just like a regular routine and that's the condition i think the church will be in just before the coming of the lord so the rapture will just go right on that way it'll just be a regular routine of following the scripture and the plans of god it ain't some super scientific thing you got to know to get yourself in a rapture you know what it is it's an everyday relationship every day you're getting a little closer and a little closer hallelujah remember that you're made in his image he feels like you feel he loves like you love where'd you get love from where'd you get faith it's all him what a release i just read that and i just laid my head back and i could not believe the lord had answered me so quickly so quickly and in a source that i couldn't doubt by a prophet and i said lord i'm not taking you for granted but i've seen you do it so many times so many times so many times so many times i just know you love me and i know you love your people and i know you're going to feed them and it's not up to me it's not on me it's you lord i want to tell you something today god loves you church he cares about you he anoints me he anoints these other ministers why because because he doesn't like you no because he lights you and loves you see so that's the way the things of god are so when i read this friends i'm not reading that this is a if i'm going to say it this way this isn't a a a lay back do nothing and wait for you know wait for it to fall on you from the heavens i'm here to tell you that the mighty angel who's bringing you rapturing faith has already descended from the heavens you're not waiting on him to come down and do something for you he's here now and the revival is among us already he's here to do for you more than you even could think or ask him to do so this is an act of life i'm out of time but i'm going to keep going not too far just carry on so this is an active life that sees that sees the demonstration of the lord working in your life and it's not if it's not that it's just denominationalism to you this thing is to be seen that you're the light of the world see so it this isn't taking him for granted this isn't taking him for granted this is familiarity that's a big difference i'm not taking him for granted i know him and the power of his resurrection that's always been my desire in philippians 3 that i may know him in the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death see but i'm going to tell you something friends you hear me now here brother jason you don't get that at distance young people you don't get that at distance you don't get familiarity you don't get that kind of familiarity at distance this requires an active daily relational type of atmosphere i i had a very strange dream actually wow i don't know why i decided to tell you all this but just trying to open up my heart seemed like maybe it was uh don't remember sweetheart did i tell you i told you about it sunday monday morning i might i think i did yeah i had it sunday night i had it yeah it was it was sunday night so i'm just backing up a little bit before waking up finding the email and finding this quote and so i found myself even in the dream and we were somewhere it seemed like we were in the mountains and i was with my family and i don't know if we were on a family vacation we sometimes take our whole tribe and go on a break but at any rate i i got to myself in the dream that's not all important why i was there but i i found myself even in the dream with this same great and deepening desire for more of god does it make sense in my life more of his presence because that's really what it's all about it's not about him coming like santa claus and doing things for me it's not really about that that's shallow that that you might as well just chase riches see but it's it's all about his presence his presence is the greatest gift of all as sister emily sang to us his presence is my greatest gift of all and it seemed that i i remember in the dream that i could feel this very same urgency of the hour and i i found myself as i was nearing the end of this and i just had this burden on my heart and as i i found myself just i took off running through a field and and as i'm running through this field i began to weep before the lord as i was running and it it felt like a sense of urgency that's no doubt born you know born of all the uh of the impending trouble you know that we see in the world i mean you look at the headlines you see that the united states is just a hair's breath away from open war with russia i mean friends things are happening at an unprecedented pace i spoke to you about that sunday that the beast system is is starting to flex its muscles see and russia is finding out the hard way and china is going to find out they're all going to find out you you can't resist the beast go to read the book of revelation he's given a power to rule the world see and he's starting to exercise he he spoke like a dragon at first but then he exercised all the power of the first beast before him which was old the old world in europe under pagan and then papal rome and so i it felt like as i was crying and i was running and this desire it all felt like an impending trouble like in like something that i and i was calling out to the lord because i felt that in my heart lord the hour it's so critical how do i get everybody on board i i you know i want to get all the young people full of the holy ghost i got to get everybody believing god i got to get all the cold people hot again i we got to come together and this is and i'm and i'm i'm aware that constantly aware but it starts with you but it starts with you but it starts with you and i'm saying well then lord help me help me help me and i was running and i was crying i was saying lord please help me and the lord was just saying i need you to empty out i need you to empty out i need you to empty out and i was saying lord i'll leave you i'll empty all empty just fill up those places that was the cry of my heart knowing in my heart that god was calling me to walk higher to accept the challenge of of greater spiritual disciplines in my life and for my ministry and i felt as though i i just needed to push more things out to make more room for him to come in and then brother mark in his email sent me this quote as well this is right after the dream and that's what the christian does i love that message the intervale that's what the christian does when you're planted in christ jesus everything that you have need of in earth's journey is in you when you receive the holy spirit and the only everybody say only and the only thing you have to do is drink drink and push out push out just drink till you can't drink no more if you have need of divine healing go to god's word and drink from it until you push out he's talking about like a tree planted by the water all it has it the nature to grow limbs and fruit and leaves is already in it they don't have to try to do it if if it just drinks in it'll push out you see and so divine healing go to god's word and drink from until you push out if you need more of god just keep drinking push out and christ is the inexhaustible fountain of life and if you're planted in him the only thing you have to do is drink of his goodness and push out whatever you have need of in this earth's journey it's all drinking resting peace and that beautiful three daisy chained words it's all drinking resting peace it's not what you struggle and strive and pull at you defeat the very purpose that you're representing when you do that you you see friends what what the prophet is trying to get us to understand is that when you when you use a method when your spiritual warfare is is to just stay in the struggle and wait on god to do something you know magic that that's a defeating battle strategy i'm here to tell you that sounds good i'm just gonna pray and ask god to come and make me a super christian that's that the devil's gonna beat you to death trying to do that because that's you struggling all you need to do is purge out everything in the world drink more in and push out the fruits of the spirit and you'll find that everything you have needed for a rapture is in you now all that cg needs is the moisture of the holy spirit and you don't get that at distance that's an active not a passive that's an active relationship you know it was so amazing i brother jack and sister kathy the gift they got me was a coffee cup that i would cherish forever and i i love it and the lid had this very text i didn't notice it just until i was the other day i was using my lid and uh and and i i i actually will separate on my little stay at home my my coffee mug i'll use out here in the fellowship hall because i like using it and if anybody sees it don't touch it give it back hey man if it goes disappearing we're gonna have a gestapo raid but but that but that lid has that scripture in timothy but thou o man of god follow after godliness and righteousness and peace and and longsuffering in these things and i didn't even notice it it was in my text and i thought my goodness there's that lid i was putting it on my ember cup because i have a cup keeps my coffee hot but it works even better if i keep a little lid on top and it just is perfect and i and and here look look at this look at these scriptures can i okay look if i take 17 more minutes can i do that 18 wait 18 and a half can i have 18 and a half look at this thou therefore my son be strong in the grace that is in christ jesus everybody talks about the grace of god be strong in the grace the grace doesn't come to me to let to let you just live a wishy-washy life say oh well the grace of god be strong in the grace the bible says that what is grace the bible identifies that the grace of god teaches us to deny ungodliness amen look at look at look at david here in the psalms depart from evil and do good seek peace and pursue it think about that look at it again depart from evil that's not passive and do good and seek peace and pursue it the eyes of the lord are upon the righteous and his ears are open to their cry you see friends look ultimately we overcome because we're prophesied we're predestinated to be overcomers the book of revelation talks about that in revelation 12 and uh and other places about how that will be an overcomer and we'll be granted to sit with him on his throne and he would be our god and and we would be his son and and in case you when i first read that you know i knew in the scripture i knew in the new testament that the word son could be one of two things it could either be who is or it could be technon and these are two greek words because technon is just the most common issues of a child it's used of offspring right and in fact is jesus was never referred to using that greek word he was never technon he was always johuios theo the son of god and it used it of him exclusively the only time he ever got called teknan when when someone called him son and used the wrong word was and mary did it she said son do you not know your father and i have saw you with tears and jesus immediately corrected that error because he was not he was not the son of joseph and he said you do you need to know i must be about my father's business see so he corrected her right quick and no one ever else tried to call him that again and when i read that in the scriptures in the book of revelation and it said that you'll sit with me in my throne and i'll be his god he that overcometh i'll be his god and he'll be my son and i read that and i thought well of course that'll be techno and that won't be who he is because that was only jesus and i went into my greek dog lot and would you imagine it was exactly who he is that he was using the exact same word it's about position and placing that you are in christ and that's why he's the beginning of the creation of god and you are a continuation of that same creation this is what god has we are predestinated to overcome it i mean ultimately we are going to overcome and in fact as he gives us a faith he gives you the faith by revelation to believe you and then he turns around and rewards you for the faith you have see but remember it's it's it's it has to be an active faith it's not it's not like santa claus see he's not just giving you some presents on christmas morning i mean there is to to be an overcomer the bible says in the book of revelation i think chapter 12 they overcame by the blood of the lamb and we do see and that's twofold because first of all remember brother branham said the blood is what keeps you why because there's a constant perpetual voice in the blood that even when you do wrong even when you slip up make a mistake but there's a blood constantly speaking they're innocent they're innocent they're innocent and god doesn't even see it because even when you stumble that it can't override that voice before god they're they're innocent they're innocent they're innocent because you're him and he was innocent see and and so there is that aspect of it and then there's also the aspect of the of the cleansing agent of the blood see that we are washed clean by the washing of the water of the word and brother branham showed us in this day it's a bleeding word why because it's christ it's a person and so it's a bleeding word it's got life in it it's not dead letter so so it has these this twofold power of rapturing faith i mean it does have rapturing faith and it does have rapturing grace that it has rapture and grace because i say i need rapturing faith but i just feel like too much of a failure brother jason i don't know if i'll ever get it don't worry the headstone comes crying grace grace unto it you just know this friends there is a rapture in grace that keeps your faith on the move and it'll never stop moving your faith forward hallelujah and so so so so when we when we think about that you know but then it comes back to the whole thing of overcoming as i read to you in the scripture the man that that that overcomes these things the man that purgeth himself the bride hath made herself ready as brother branham said there's things god won't do he's waiting on you to do it you say oh i just need i heard brother jack today on our on our call and i was one of the commentators coming behind him brother jack said something i never heard in my life and he said he's just talking about people who are always wanting god you know to do it for him god just deliver me just set me free i got i'm trapped up i got this habit in my life would you just take it from me and brother jack said ain't that funny you didn't pray to get it and now you want to pray to get rid of it say wow oh how'd i get it you picked it up so what'd i do lay it down hey man you say well okay that's that's that's neat that's that's a nice little way to say it but the problem is now it's got a hold in my life it's got it's it's addicting to me all right now you can go to prayer now you can say lord god i want to draw closer to you i'm going to empty out things of the world i'm going to get more in your word i'm going to read the bible i'm going to be at church i'm going to listen to tapes i'm going to and you know what you're doing you start strengthening yourself until finally you're able to lay it down and walk away because everything you have need of for a rapture is in you now you have the ability to be free tonight you have the ability to lay it down and go forward hallelujah the cleaning agent in the word that you feed on daily i hope oh i hope we're way too evil to not be feeding on the word daily you're crazy if you don't feed on the word daily if all you do is work and play you young people if all you do is go to school and come home and play and work a job and go home and go to school and come home and play and you don't daily feed and use the cleaning agent of the word to wash your mind hallelujah it's going home time friends it's time for rapturing faith to be on the scene and i believe that this is what god is calling for your bethel tabernacle you're the church of god hallelujah oh let it wash your mind there's a power within you to do these things brother branham i got two quotes can i read them to you i don't know if i put them on here let me see watch this no i don't have it so i'm just going to tell them to you all right you can take that down g-man brother branham i'm just silly enough that i started to do this tonight but i chickened out i was gonna bring a i got some sister wanda's cake left over and i thought i'll either bring that cake or bring some peanut m m's and i'll just break them out while i'm preaching start munching on what are you doing i'm i'm i'm getting my sweets in i'm getting something very sweet and i'll be sitting here eating like cake but i thought man i'm gonna make everybody run out the door and go try to buy some cake or m ms and i'll lose their attention brother branham says i mean we love sweets don't we come on be honest amen so i'm trying to stay in shape rounds of shape all right oh i tell you he says here in testimony of raising a dead boy in 1953 brother and starts talking about trials and uh you know trials are an amazing thing brother branham says here oh i tell you this is the most marvelous thing that i've seen ever seen in my life is the greatest hours of my life now here you say man do tell a prophet is about to reveal his greatest moments in life ready you hanging on the the the most marvelous thing that i ever seen in my life is the greatest hours of my life when i get up against a wall that i can't get over i can't get over it under it or around it that's right then i trust god and he opens the way and i go through the thing god takes you through it that's then watch this now then when you come out now how many can relate to that god has delivered us how many times have you been in a hard trial i mean what a real hard one and it was long and it was arduous and it was hot and you god finally broke you through the other side now you're where william branham is you ready he says then when you come out of it on the other side it's like samson when he killed the lion when he got on the other side when he killed the lion he got the sweetest honey he ever eat out of that old carcass of that line and sometimes if you'll overcome something by the grace of god it'll be one of the sweetest things you ever tasted in your life i just thought i don't need m m's i i don't need to want this cake i love them but i i i want to be an overcomer that's my sweet that'll fix your sweet tooth overcome a heart trial and come out on the other side and look back and see a defeated enemy and see the wreckage of the battlefield and know that your enemy's in the rearview mirror hallelujah and you're moving forward we talked about it today kate and i were talking about it and she's walking me helping me get fit we were actually socializing her new little dog and out here on this big concrete highway they've got for people walking like me who need to do it and i start talking to her and we start talking about overcoming trials i said you know honey look brother branham said he said you know look because he was always nervous brother man was terribly nervous it affected him horribly but he said you know i got to thinking what if i didn't have any nerves he said you know what if i just was like whatever he said i'd just be a dish rag he said but the fact that i gotta battle through it and press through it and come through it in victory he said see he said that's what he said so it's what makes me what i am today and he said so nerves end up being a blessing a blessing trials become a blessing because god like we read in the scripture you know you're pursuing your eternal life you're going after it hard after you're trying to become everything that god called you and gave you eternal life for in the first place but the jack did a funny thing that it's not funny like comedy but it's ironic ironically funny he he got his church one night his true story he just told it today and he said i i had my church that i think you had the deacon go around and just take you know tear up blank pieces of paper and he said i want everybody to take a piece of paper and i want you just to write on this paper you don't just sign it i'm not going to call you i'm not going to embarrass you i'm not going to label you and identify you i'm not going to out you i just want you to write you know the top couple two three things the of the greatest events of your life the greatest things that's ever happened to you now you know what they did they they did what you do they they talked about oh the the the the day i i found my wife you know or or the day i found my husband or or the day that i found the lord and i got saved and the lord filled me with the holy ghost or i i had an incurable disease and the lord healed me and was just a miracle and today i'm free and you know and and he said he he got the whole stack up there and it was all just like that they're all pretty much pretty much carbon copies the day the lord saved me the day i found my my love of my life the day he healed me of this so that this deliverance came the day that i my children were born everybody you know talking about all these different things and these are the greatest things that's ever happened to me and he said now he said let me read you what a prophet said the greatest thing of your life was how you ready for the title how can i overcome 1963 in the days of daniel's time there was four overcomers that could stand the test of fire and lion now we're expected to be tested that's a good lesson for my brother back there also he that cometh to god must first be tested tested what with the word that's god's test do you believe it congregation says he that cometh to god must be tested see that only shows a true child then see be tested and when the test comes on you can't overcome lest there's a test give to you and when test is given it's to see whether you can overcome or not and jesus said to him that overcometh the test see the test is the greatest thing that ever happened to you it's not when you've met the love of your life it's not when you got healed of something it's not none of that your children were a great accomplishment grandchildren are better but the the greatest thing that ever happened to you is you got a test and you passed it that is the greatest thing that god could ever do for you why am i preaching this tonight because i'm preaching to you part two of approaching perfection let's stand whoa man i had 90 seconds hallelujah oh i i i i'm partial to sermons like that where i just get to amen amen just open up my heart and just preach to you from my heart is that okay tonight friends i hope it's a benefit i imagine it was sure was a benefit to me thinking about it and looking at what god has for us in this day we're going to take

like these as the song says we have an anchor and the song goes on to say i've heard my mother sing it for years be very sure be very sure that your anchor holds oh lord that that it's anchored in the solid rock and that rock is jesus he's the only one father tonight i pray for your mercy in our lives i pray lord for all listening far and near standing in this visible audience we know that there are many who stream from afar live or catch it by archive i pray for them lord i pray tonight lord that this word will become a living reality in their lives if that doesn't happen then all of our knowledge is vain everything we think we know is worthless and actually only ends up making us more culpable if we don't allow it to live in our lives we'd have been better better to have never heard it so i pray master for your mercy in our lives that we'll have a willingness in our heart to believe all the word of god and to allow it as the bible says to let the mind which was in christ be in you to let the word of god dwell in you richly i want to pursue old man of god pursue righteousness chase after it go get it go after faith and faithfulness let the grace of god teach you how to deny ungodliness let god show you the things that need to be let go from your life so that you can make more room for him this is a dangerous hour lord it's a an hour that's never been no age has ever faced darkness and deception of this kind be very sure your anchor holds in the solid rock be very sure that you know him in the power of his resurrection be very sure that you're willing to know him in the fellowship of his sufferings and that you're willing to be made conformable unto his death so that you can die to yourself completely so that he might rebirth you alive again in the newness of christ there's no greater need we have than that we have prayer requests tonight that come in we read them out you heard them lord they're on our heart i pray for every one of them i pray for deliverance and healing and surgeries and and and health and recovery lord and i pray for these things for these people and i ask for your mercy lord on all these cases but most of all that are we'd be very sure of where we stand tonight that would be have our anchor in christ i committed to you now commit all of these things into your loving care in the name of jesus christ our lord the solid
