just use this one brother Brad amen God bless you we're happy to have you uh here in Bethel Tabernacle this evening it's a special service for us amen happy to see so many visitors here and some of them are going to be class visitors these two guys on the front are not visitors they are home folk who are temporarily visiting other places amen so we're happy to have them back Amen in the fold with us here this evening worshiping we're happy to see otherwise there's two brothers over here and a young man and some different ones on the back there I see Sister Janet good to have her Amen brother Danny good friend of mine for many many years and his mom and dad were great friends um amen it's it's hard to imagine how fast time flies hey brother Danny amen so I tell people we must be having fun amen well it's wonderful to serve the Lord isn't it and um so we're happy to have you joining us here tonight we have a little bit of a different kind of a schedule we've kind of abbreviated the preliminary singing and we have a Ministry team here for those who aren't familiar with it we have seven preachers here counting myself and so um we have one of them away brother Jason Demars is in Connecticut ministering tonight amen I'm glad to see the Lord strengthening our brother amen and so enemy was trying to attack him with some sickness but we've been praying for him a number of other things we've been praying for uh throughout the day especially as it relates to the ministry team amen so we're looking to for the Lord to continue to do great things for us what we are going to do now that we've had a few worship songs and I I just said my goodness what a way to end the new year amen praise the Lord let the devil know where we stand amen and so I was able to go today uh sister Debbie and I attended the funeral of our dear sister Jan now some of you don't really know Sister channel that well even if you were acquainted with her for some of the older members here we go way back with Brother Gary and sister Jan so sister Jan was a very precious treasure to us and the Lord saw fit to step over all of our prayers and bring his child home we just say blessed be the name of the Lord amen but we're going to plan a memorial here because the funeral service was just a small Affair and so we're going to plan a much larger event a memorial service we don't have the dates worked out exactly because the problem was that some of her children who are snowbound from that blizzard that went through they weren't even able to get out so they couldn't make the Trek down and so the funeral went forward so now we're going to arrange it with them to see maybe it's either going to need to be the second Sunday or the third Sunday we're tentatively aiming at the 15th of January we might have to move it a week forward to the to the weekend to the Sunday previous we're going to have it on a Sunday and where what we're going to do is I've invited Brother Scott Smith who also ministered the funeral today to come back down again amen and we're going to have um we'll we'll we'll kind of start in a different way and it'll be it'll be like a memorial Sunday and we'll run it a little bit different also it'll give me an opportunity to say what's on my heart Brother Scott was saying today he didn't really have enough time uh you never do in those funeral homes I don't like doing it in a church man when you come into a church you can just it's a it's a beautiful thing Amen to to to realize that you know the the precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his children and you know as I've said many times I heard brother Dale say it many years ago it stuck with me said the world you know can't under understand they can't really get it but to the to the believer death is really preferred to life because that's where life really starts amen this is just a training ground here and a man that's born of a woman job said and we all are is just a few days in full of trouble and so we're looking to that happy reunion with our sister so I told Brother Scott I said that'll give you a chance to it'll give me a chance to bring some things on my heart of how we felt about sister Jan and then it'll allow Brother Scott to come forward I said and just take the first 15 or so minutes and say the things you didn't have time to say and then just go on and preach and let's just have a full service and we'll call the whole thing a big Memorial Sunday we'll have dinner on the ground and fellowship and and amen we will really memorialize the wonderful friendship and the life of our sister and you'll get the word of God all in one you'll get fellowship and singing and natural food and spiritual food amen we will have a wonderful time so we've we're trying to work it out the only thing that's determining the schedule is what her daughter and son can do they're up north way up North and so we got to try to work out the schedule with them I'll let you know more on that as we go so tonight we're going to have our ministry team come up and we're going to we've got six of them here and Counting myself so we're going to bring them on and let them deliver their heart a little bit it's impossible to preach a sermon in 10 minutes but that's about all they're going to get amen and so amen so amen praise the Lord Brother Tony I might keep him close because he knows how to put people on the ground if he has to and so and so and I've seen he can do it quick let me tell you amen so uh whether Tony don't play but we're happy to have them all here with us tonight and we're going to just invite you to relax and we're going to let them come and deliver some things on their heart and then I'll finish it up kind of anchor it and make a few comments something Lord put on my heart the other morning early amen amen in my 5 a.m chair brother Jack praise the lord lord gave me a wonderful thought I went in there and talked sister Debbie got her up and poured half a cup of coffee down there and then started preaching to her and amen next thing you know we were both crying amen so uh the Lord is good amen brother Joe I think you're going to kick it off so why don't you come on my brother God bless you tonight we'll just let everybody use this right amen are you talking about tackling preachers brother Luther was clapping awful hard back there I tell you I don't know kind of made me a little nervous but we're so happy to be here tonight I'm going to talk real fast because I don't have a whole lot of time unless I can get Seth to go back here and turn that clock back for me every now and then I'll just Seth I'll nod at you and you climb up on that ladder back there and turn it back for a few minutes all right so we're going to look in the Book of James you don't have to stand just take your bibles if you want to James the first chapter 14th verse and it says here every man is tempted when he's drawn away of his own lust and enticed then when lust at hath conceived it bringeth for sin and sin when it is finished bringeth forth death do not air my beloved Brethren every good gift and every perfect gift is from above and cometh down from the Father of Lights with whom is no variableness neither shadow of turning of his own will be Gat he us with the word of truth that we should be a kind of first roots of his creatures amen now what I want to talk about is we're you know as being the New Year we We tend to look back and and we reflect on the things that happen a lot of times they'll have specials um like who died this you know who was famous that died and and then we look forward to the future we're looking to make a new resolution and and um I tell you what I got tired of making New Year's resolutions I just never could hold to them but um but you know we we try to look so what I want to focus on tonight is the word focus is that if we can not so much look back in the past so much because we tend to like the the we like to beat up on ourselves a lot and the devil don't need no help doing that let me tell you because he's a he's a good one for it and he always reminds you of your past but you know as Paul said in Philippians 3 13 this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before now I don't want to dwell on the things in the past because the Bible doesn't even teach that it tells us to be looking forward to what great things are ahead of us amen now I want to talk to you about overcoming power now I didn't use about one minute counting down here overcoming power because in this day and time that's what the devil if he can take away your joy he's got you whipped now he'll get you whipped for just a little while but let me tell you something if we can just look and see what kind of tactics that he uses but what we have to do is what Paul said here the first thing we have to do is he says if we're drawn away of our own lust now lust can be any kind of a desire a natural desire you have or any kind of physical desire but you're drawn away of that buy it by your own lust and when it's conceived now we might be tempted by things but it don't mean you have to give in to them but you know like brother Raph said a bird can fly over your head but you don't have to let it make a nest there so when it's conceived when you let that thing in then it starts sprouting it starts growing starts coming out now what happens when it's conceived it brings forth what what death amen When sin is conceived it bringeth forth death now what we don't want to do is give the devil a place to that so if we if we think about the word Focus let's focus on this next verse it says 17 every good gift think about the goodness of God okay the Bible says that when you pray you must believe and believe that he is and a rewarder of them right now we say okay every good and when brother Brandon would pray in the old tapes he would say almighty God author of life and Giver of every good gift he would quote this scripture right here because only let me tell you something God gives good gifts the Holy Ghost is a gift he don't force it on you just like a pardon a pardon is no good you can be pardoned but if you don't receive that pardon it can't be forced on you it's a gift to do you can receive it or you can reject it and the Holy Ghost is the same way and it's a gift it's given to you he wants to give it to you more than you even want to receive it it's a precious gift amen now he's good every perfect gift is from above and cometh down from the Father of Lights he made all the lights the moon stars Universe galaxies everything that is out there there's no darkness in him no shadow of turning he has he all the lights was was made everything that was that's made was made by him cometh down from the Father of Lights which whom has no variables no shadow of turning he's the unchanging God he never changes hold to God's unchanging hand let me tell you something the the politics will change your your taste will change everything changes we know the weather changes if you don't like the weather here just wait about five minutes and it'll change so we know that God is the unchanging God the son is always in the same place but even as as as stable as that is We Know by science it's moving too it all the galaxies are moving but God doesn't move amen he's always there the unchanging God now think on those things so when you're having trial when you're having problems think about the goodness of God and the unchangeableness of God okay now of his own will we were begotten is what he says with the word of Truth now when Satan comes at you with Temptations and desires and things like that you can sit there and you can tell him how you feel you can tell him what you're thinking he don't care he loves that but let me tell you something he don't like is the word when you give him the word he takes running and you need to speak it out just don't just don't think it a lot of times oh you know maybe in your mind but start speaking those words to him there's something there's power in the word in the spoken word you say whatever you're tempted with cigarettes you say if if I defile this Temple God will destroy it don't be drunken with wine if you're tempted to look upon a woman remember what Jesus said you've already committed adultery with her in your heart start speaking those things out and rebuking the devil with it God will take those words that you said and he'll amplify it and magnify it and go and defeat the enemy now you might have to do it two or three times but speak it out amen that's how you do it with the word praise God now and we're the first fruits of his creatures oh my sometimes maybe you think well I'm a nobody I'm just a nothing I'm an insignificant little person but let me tell you something you're the cream of the crop in God's eyes there ain't nothing better than you are let me tell you something in this day and time that we live in you're the best that God has for this world think about that devil give that to him one time it's God living in human flesh again the whole purpose of Christ to come was to sanctify you so that the Holy Spirit can live in you and when he does you're not going to have malice you're not going to have hatred you're not going to have unforgiveness you're not going to have all these things that plague us day and night but we're going to be living for him looking toward his coming amen I can't see nothing so I got to keep this on of his own will he began us why with the word of truth that we should be a kind of first crew fruits of his creatures wherefore my beloved Brethren let every man be swift to hear slow to speak and slow to wrath that's where I want to be I got a few more minutes here now we are his first fruits now I want to think about the word focus and I wrote this down f-o-c-u-s Focus F forgive one another and yourself a lot of times we can't get past our past we can't get past what what the devil always puts up in front of us and maybe somebody said something to you or did something to you or you just can't get past what happened to you as a child I watch videos of people that are strung out on drugs homeless don't have hardly any hope in life and you can just about every time trace it back to something that happened to them when they were little something that happened to him in their life somehow the devil got in and and disrupted the plan that God had for their life oh my but forgive one another and forgive yourself now when Jesus said when you pray forgive it wasn't a suggestion it would be good if you forgive no he didn't say that he said when you pray forgive now he wouldn't give you the Commandment if he don't give you the power to do what he's said to do a lot of times folks say well so-and-so didn't do anything they haven't shown any remorse yet they haven't shown me that they're sorry that has nothing to do with it for forgiveness is not for that person forgiveness is for you Jesus said when you're down praying and you have ought against the brother go to that brother make it right also he said it both ways when you're down praying and a brother has all against you go to that brother now you can't always make it right that's up to him but that'll be on him you've done the right thing amen oh only believer's word silence everything else in your life that don't line up with God's word you kick it out kick it to the curb put it in the trash can on trash day amen only believe his word silence everything else C call on him daily in prayer oh when the trials get hard when the way gets rough go to your knees and say oh God help me today give me strength Bless the people in my church bless the pastor bless my wife bless my children help me oh God clean out everything in me that's not like you let me hate the things that you hate and love the things that you love Lord put that in my heart amen Unity of the faith amen Unity of the Brotherhood Fellowship come to church you can't have a whole lot of unity if you ain't in the body of Christ if you're not around fellowship with brothers and sisters of like Precious Faith oh my I got one more minute s sanctify your mind sanctify your eyes and your body as a Living Sacrifice unto God make it a sacrifice unto him and just say oh God sanctify my heart sanctify my mind sanctify my old dirty mouth sanctify my thoughts Lord job said I made a covenant with my eyes we need to make a covenant with our eyes amen do you love him let me read that again Philippians this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before I'm looking for great things this year you amen I'm looking to grow High go higher deeper depths in the love of Christ Brother Brad come on you better get on on your feet come on up here brother amen [Applause] brother I wish I went first man it's hard to back something like that man I feel like I'm just going to go over here and play a tape or something Hallelujah man like brother Donna used to say there's two people two kinds of preachers that makes me want to preach one who can and one who can't laughs so and this is a bad idea to have a microphone in our hand brother Joe can we take our coat off I'm just a a dumbo hillbilly so I went to look up the word exhortation I say he used that word a lot I got to know exactly what it means so the meaning of that word is it comes to the Greek word to call to one side to summon to encourage to admonish to entreat a language intended to incite or stir or encourage so I guess tonight we're here to stir you up we're here to encourage in Psalms 46 7 . now when he told us he was going to be doing this and I was sitting here praying and this verse Lord of hosts is with us just kept going through my mind the Lord of hosts is with us the god of Jacob is our refuge oh Hallelujah we can sit down right there and say it's been good to be here but what a year that we've had what are you I mean what a time we're living in it's one of the worstest times ever ever we say that every year this has been the worst year ever and it is it has to be it's going to get worse but I believe as a believer of Christ it's the greatest time we've been living in the world is going it's gone crazy they've lost their mind through my men don't know who they are women don't know who they are you know what I'm talking about they go nuts insane but we sit here tonight in our right mind in her right mind you know disasters hitting this world I mean just disasters just this year floods everywhere killing people earthquakes earthquake in Afghanistan killed a thousand people back in June we got droughts earthquakes fires hurricanes all kinds of disasters that's hit this country the judgments of God it's not only that that's not counting the diseases that's on this place pitiful this world is going crazy the world is being rocked to a core earthquakes are shaking this place the Earth is groaning as we know brother Branham said the Earth is groaning for deliverance oh brother and sister are you groaning for deliverance tonight oh God he's shaking us through our core he just want to throw off unbelief he wants to throw off all doubt all these just throw it all out Shake us oh we want to be shook if you don't want to be shut come up here we'll lay hands on you and we'll start shaking you Shake us through our corn till we can say Lord Jesus Deliver Us from this flesh body that we live in [Music] oh but I believe the natural types of the spiritual the Earth is groaning we should be groaning we should be like Revelation says Lord come quickly Lord Jesus you should be fervently we should be groaning for this oh we're seeking that deliverance and he's a common it's but it's been the worst year he won't get no better and we've had death in our families sickness Cancers and their families their loved ones all kinds of things striking this world but it's going to get worse I've got bad news and I've got good news the bad news is it's going to get worse it's going to get worse the good news is it's going to get better it's going to get better Hallelujah I'm just going to go ahead and say this if you're sitting here or if you're listening on the internet you listening if you're not saved and filled with the Holy Ghost and you're just playing games oh with it this this morning come to me and I was like no I'm not going to do this you better was the voice that spoke to me so you just take it from him I'm just a mailman I'm here just delivering this if you're just playing games doing and worrying things that you know that's not right nobody sees you oh everybody thinks you're doing fine because you're in church you've got your hands raised warning oh my goodness you get mad at the preacher because his voice is condemning your heart oh I've got plenty of time there goes that preacher again year after year New Year's Eve the Lord is coming this year so this is another preacher's gonna take a place this year and if I'm here next New Year's Eve the Rapture is going to take place then so we got to be ready you've got to be ready I give this warning I'm going to give it and the way it was given to me just this morning it's time to stop playing games if you keep playing around with the world it's gonna get you foreign oh my goodness be sure your sins will find you out if you play with fire you're going to get burned Lord have merciful now just today this appears the Lord just dropping down to that office I better I better I'd be afraid not to say anything but this world like I said is going to get worse and worse and sin is greater and the devil's on a rampage if you think this is bad Watch What Happens Next but I'm going to go ahead and tell you right now it's the best time ever for the Bride of Jesus Christ [Music] this year we've grown more closer to God more closer to each other we sit in these services and I don't know about you but there's sometimes I feel like I'm about to explode with what's coming across this Pulpit Word of Life that's what we're hearing uh about ready to explode right now there's more time I got stupid oh well what good times we're having Hallelujah if you thought this year was good tomorrow's January 1st start of a new year if you thought this year was good God said watch this Watch What Happens Next it's Rapture time oh Hallelujah I want to go watch what he has in store for you Psalms 46 1. God is our refuge and strength a very present help in trouble whatever you're going through God's a present help in a time of trouble therefore will not and though the amount is be carried into the midst of the sea though the waters thereof Roar and be troubled though the mountain Shake of the swelling thereof Salah Salah means pause David get all got all up in the spirit he said God's my refuge and my strength he's my help I will not fear I don't care if the mountains are going to go in the midst of the sea Paul's we ain't got time we got to move on there's a river the streams whereofs shall make glad the city of God the holy place of the Tabernacles of the most high God is in the midst of her and she shall not be moved Hallelujah we got to move on man I lost my place there is a river the streets whereof shall make glad the city of God the holy place of the Tabernacles of the most high God is in the midst of her she shall not be moved God shall help her and write early not just early but right early you wonder why you get up at five in the morning God wants to deal with you right early before there's a devil up God's deals with you whatever you're going through God's already on it Hallelujah he's on the job the Heathen raised the kingdoms were moved he uttered his voice and the Earth melted the Lord of hosts is with us the god of Jacob is our refuge pause come and behold the works of the Lord what desolations he hath made in the Earth he make us Wars to cease unto the end of the Earth he breakth a bow he cutth the spear in Thunder he burneth The Chariot with fire then he says Be Still whatever you're going through whatever problem you're facing it seems like God don't answer you be still and know that I am God I will be exalted among the Heathen I will be exalted in the Earth final statement the Lord of hosts is with us the god of Jacob is our refuge Paul [Applause] it's only been 20 minutes foreign all right now I gotta follow that uh so um we uh let me I'm gonna start a timer so I don't get lost the um so I want to uh I'm gonna have to Channel my inner Dale Smith Auctioneer to get through my material um so I want to read uh Judges chapter 16 verses one through three um then Samson oh disappeared here then went Samson to Gaza and saw their Harlot and went in unto her and was told the Gazette saying Samson has come hither and they can pass him in and laid weight for him all night in the gate of the city and were quiet all the night saying in the morning when it is day we shall kill him and Samson lay till midnight and arose at midnight and took the doors of the Gate of the city and the two posts and went away with them barnal and put them them upon his shoulders and carry them up to the top of a hill that is before Hebron um and I want to read this uh this is from letting off the pressure it says you say well I wonder brother Branham I don't wonder he says you don't wonder you just let off the pressure commit your case to God and go in as if as if it was all over don't build up pressure it lets off pressure well you say I'm so worried brother Branham I just don't know let off the pressure Amen in the City of Refuge he took your worry so you don't have to have it cast your cares on him for he cares for you don't you worry about your cares that's his business all right so I want to take this um some of y'all might remember the last time I I ministered I had a uh I might have mentioned I was talking about you know like the gates of hell and whatnot and I I mentioned that the Gates of Hell keep you in not yeah they keep you in don't they don't keep you out and I said I was going to get back to that well here it is um so um so I I like the story of Samson because here he is he's going into the city doing something he knew he wasn't supposed to be doing right and he gets himself from the situation where he's completely transgressed so much of what the Commandments of God are and then has to use a gift that God put in his life to get him back out and I always identified with this because so many times I'm sure you know as we all have done we've gotten to situations where we knew better than to get ourselves in there and that then we got to get it then it's God delivers us and gets us back out but then to me the story isn't really about what Samson you know Samson in the city it's what he does after the after that right because it says that he carried those Gates on his shoulders to a hill outside of Hebron now if any of you have ever actually looked how far Hebron is from Gaza it's about 35 miles it wasn't like he just you know ripped him off the hinges and set him down he packed those Gates for 35 miles and you know you figure average walking speed that's like 12 to 14 hours of walking so he does this at midnight and he's done setting him down till two o'clock the next day and you think when in that time what's going through his head you know sure he got delivered but the agony of that situation is just crushing him for 35 miles and it just doesn't go away and so the whole time the battle the battle in Giza took how long five minutes the battle after the battle took 14 hours and so so many times we'll get in a situation and God will Deliver Us and will be delivered a lot of times the situations that we got ourselves into and then we'll pack the guilt of that for 35 years or we'll pack you know you get healing in your body you know those Gates of Hell are trying to trap you in that depression trap you in that sin trap you in that sickness and then the Lord will deliver you and then for the next the rest of your life you know whatever whatever that is oh well I got delivered of this sickness but what if it comes back right and this thing that constant those Gates just sitting on your shoulders you know the gates of hell just crushing him the whole time and it just never went away and so he's he's carrying these Gates and I I picture them in my mind like so many of us you know carrying that that guilt of some past thing um I know I've had some experience with this I know there's I've met a lot of people who've struggled with this seems like a common thing um you know you hear especially when you I think when you're raising the message you're so exposed to a lot of what certain quotes and things scriptures a lot of times the devil will take certain scriptures and will use those against you right the devil's the devil's really good at using scriptures against you I mean you see this precedent you know first thing he does with Jesus is throw scripture at him you know and so how many times especially teenagers who grew up in the message are you know maybe late teens even young teens who are sitting there growing up and have had struggles with certain things and now there might have even got deliverance from certain things and yet will grow up into adulthood struggling the devil constantly telling them oh well you sinned and you're There's No Redemption for you send your day day of Grace away that time at that meeting where you could have got deliverance and the minister called you up and you felt that poll and you didn't go that was your last day I mean I know I've met I I mean I know this happens know this happens I've I know adults who have went 15 years struggling with this stuff have the Holy Ghost and the devil still got him wound up on this and when they were delivered years ago and they're still and so you know and he so here's Samson like so many of us carrying Gates of guilt or depression you know just just even though you're delivered it just doesn't go away said and you're still carrying this well it says that he and then then he he goes and Carries him up a mountain right it's not it's not you know so here he is he's got all this all these these burdens and he's trudging up this mountain right and it said that he he set them down on the hill outside of Hebron in the strongs it actually says translates that as the mountain that overlooks Hebron so here is climbing this mountain and I imagine that so I question I thought why Hebron of all the places right all these cities why did he pick Hebron Hebron is a City of Refuge and I mean I don't know that's what he was thinking but I was thinking it and I imagine in my mind here's Samson bearing all this guilt and shame and as he Crest that Hill he looks down on Hebron and that is what gives him that moment of realization all I have to do to get out from under this crushing burden is just let go it's he didn't have to go do something special just let it go just stop and I how many times do we do this where we're dragging our burdens and our all these these things some some you know condemnation that the devil put on you of something that you did so many years ago and you're still beating yourself up for it let it go there's a City of Refuge once you go into that City of Refuge there they can't follow you anymore your sins stop at the gate there's a um I'll um I'll wrap it up with this um is also from letting off the pressure it says now if if you want to do right I'm so glad tonight to tell you that there is a City of Refuge that Jesus Christ that's Jesus Christ if you don't want to do wrong the enemies after you then there's a way of escape and that escape is Jesus Christ there is a place where you can come and let off the steam and so whatever pressure the world has got you under right your own past your own memories your own that that fear in your head well oh I got healed but what if it comes back you know did I really get healed the answer is yes you really did get healed and whatever that whatever that lie is that's just crushing you down go to that City of Refuge and get your deliverance and okay amen praise the Lord amen just gonna go right into the scripture here look at the time perfect good to be in the house of the Lord First Kings 17. one I'm just going to take a little thought on seasons and Elijah the Tish bite first king 17 1 and Elijah the tishbite who was of the inhabitants of Gilead said unto Ahab as the Lord God of Israel liveth before whom I stand there shall not be due nor Reign these years but according to my word and the word of the Lord came unto him saying get thee hint and turn the Eastward and hide thyself by the Brook cherith that is before Jordan and it shall be that thou shalt drink of the brook that I have commanded the Ravens to feed thee there and he went and did according to the word of the Lord for he went and dwelt by the Brook cherith that is before Jordan and the Ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning and bread and flesh in the evening and he drank of the brook and it came to pass after a while that the brook dried up because there had been no rain in the land and the word of the Lord came unto him saying arise get thee to zarephith which belongeth to zidan and dwell there behold I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee we're going to turn over to Psalm 61 and we're just going to read two two verses says Hear My Cry o God attend unto my prayer and from the end of the Earth will I cry unto thee when my heart is overwhelmed who's ever had that prayer before when my heart is overwhelmed but it doesn't say that there's a colon it says lead me to the rock that is higher than I and when I was reading this scripture the thought that just came upon my heart was you know we have these these Seasons that we go through in our life and every believer is at a different season of season of development that we're going through sometimes it can feel like David says here that your heart can just feel so overwhelmed by it you feel overwhelmed by what you're going through you feel overwhelmed by by the weight of the world you feel overwhelmed by the pressures and it and it's as low as you know you can be a young child all the way up you know your seasons change but that overwhelmed feeling can maybe stay there for a long time but we have something to look to we have a rock that is higher than ourselves we have something that we that we can take a place of a refuge in amen when brother Burley was ministering uh Christmas morning he said something that struck my heart it tied directly in with this was something the Lord's been dealing with me he talked about house you know he'll be reading something and maybe he doesn't quite understand it and that he could be pondering that thing in his mind for long periods of time but then maybe he hears a message preach or maybe he hears a tape of the Prophet or maybe maybe something happens and and then the light of Revelation just strikes him and when that lighter Revelation strikes no devil in hell can take that away from you because that is now something that the Lord has done for you you had a question on your heart you had something that you were going through you had a struggle a trial something but you were led to the rock that was higher than you your heart fell overwhelmed but you were led to that rock that was higher than you glory to God I think that's such an important foundation for believers to realize in any day in any age that you're at because when you give your heart to the Lord when the Lord when the Lord pulls you in you don't just automatically when you're you know you get the gift of the Holy Ghost you don't just automatically enter into the a fully matured state you have to go through seasons in your life you have to go through seasons of development seasons of change where the Lord is growing you it it you know you you have you have the Elijah here you have him go into this Brook he prophesied here right he was sustained he was he prophesied that there's going to be uh there's going to be a drought in the land and every meal was brought to him by this scripturally unclean bird and by the Brook of the water but the Lord was training him for something the Lord had him take a detour imagine if he had to go to he had this Commission on his life to go to zarephith and there was going to be a widow woman there there was going to be a need there there was going to be something that would go down in the ages to this day people read that story and have been found delivered to that of delivered of something because they have this widow woman that they can look at in the scriptures and they can see oh my goodness something happened there and it can happen for me too her heart was so overwhelmed by something but she was able to be found at a rock that was higher than herself glory to God but what did Elijah have to go through he had to go through a season of development he had to go through that Brook he had to be sustained by this unclean bird that didn't it didn't make any sense to the world sometimes the things we go through they don't make sense to the world they don't make sense to what your friends they don't make sense to things but God has something in plan for you he has something in order and it may not be for yourself it may be for your brother or your sister whoever it is for but he has a rock that he has and he's it's leading you to that rock glory to God it was time for him to go into this next phase now he had been hit he had this trust he learned how to trust he learned how to be he was a prophet the whole time he was always ordained but God had to lead him to this place where he could trust just a little bit more he had to lead him to this place of compassion where he could have compassion for this little widow woman who she had nothing to sustain her he had just been in that situation where he had nothing to sustain him but now so now he can see what she was going through sometimes we'd go through things just so that we can see what this person has gone through we go through these things so that we can have a rock that is higher than ourselves to look upon glory to God he uses those seasons in our life to grow us and to mature us they are to instruct us and to teach us oh my I'm sorry brother I'm moving Psalms 32 8 I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which Thou shalt go I will guide thee with mine I oh man what how many how long has it been oh okay Lord forget all right okay I shared this with some brothers some months ago during some Men's breakfast and it's something that the Lord just you know I desire a greater walk with the Lord I think we can all raise our hands and say that I desire a greater knowledge of the word I desire a greater knowledge of the message I desire a greater Revelation I want to be further at than where I am right now and sometimes I can look at that scripture and I can feel overwhelmed by it all these sermons all these all this word there's so much Lord I just want to sit down at a table and eat it all up but I can't that is not how the Lord does it he has you go through seasons in your life so that you can develop yeah as you go through things in your life so that you can so you can be sustained so that you can learn from them we can't just enter into a state of full maturity we have to go through our Seasons we have to go through our times that's how the Lord designs it he designs that for a specific purpose Hallelujah and maybe it's just like whether brother Burley said maybe you have something on your heart even tonight that you've been pondering for a long time but if you keep your heart sincere and you devote yourself to seeking after a greater experience with the Lord Jesus he's going to take you into that further experience he's gonna take you and he's gonna lead you into the rock that is higher than yourself glory to God maybe it'll be a sermon by a brother preached in the light of revelation will strike or maybe it'll be as simple as you're just driving home and you're having a conversation with your wife and she just says something and it strikes you and you have that question in your heart and then it was answered and then man there's a jubilee oh praise God thank you Jesus glory to God oh sometimes we we look at ourselves and man I wish I was farther down the road than I am I have that every morning I get up I wish I was farther down the road oh but friends you're not what you used to be and just remember that oh we're not what we used to be we may not be what we need to be but we're not what we used to be and we're striving for something greater glory to God Hallelujah and until you are in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus until we are in our raptured condition we've all got some growing to do amen we're all attaining to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ as it says in Ephesians amen and that's what I want to strive for a more mature walking Jesus Christ walking towards Perfection oh a faith-filled prayer life seeking after the fruits of the spirit always having the attitude thy will be done nevertheless I have desires but thy will be done glory to God let's take this new year and whatever season that you're in and press towards the rock that is higher than yourself hey Lord Hallelujah let's all stand to our feet you can be seated Ephesians 6 believeth and if you could put that up have you enjoyed the preaching amen the word of God my goodness talking about Roman Candle just one after the next I just enjoyed it thoroughly and maybe I'm here tonight just uh feeling a little bit less uh more not so much in a high gear but in a low gear just something heavy upon my heart the Lord has just instructed me to speak on just for a few minutes that I got and I'm not good at keeping time so 808 I'm I'm going to start I almost uh hesitated to even uh what what I'm going to say here I'm going to share a testimony just something that the Lord did uh here recently for me and uh and so I I was a little bit what I'm going to share I'd be totally comfortable sharing here with all my friends and family in the local church here but sometimes the Lord does some things and maybe you'd be hesitant to just tell anybody so almost was tempted to kill the live stream and just mute the audio don't worry I won't do that to you you'll still be able to hear me but uh we'll just see how the Lord leads if I we keep it up or not I just don't know there's something very unique that the Lord did in my life and uh just here recently and so I'm going to share it Ephesians chapter 6 verse 1. we'll just begin reading uh actually let's let's hold the scripture just to save time instead I'm just going to I'm just going to paraphrase a few things here that I have in my notes I thought it was incredible in the scripture what that I was going to read was Ephesians 6 that we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against powers and principalities and spiritual wickedness in high places I thought it was amazing brother Brad that what you've had upon your heart stirring you was the Lord of hosts which I know we've taught on that here before in that English translation for Lord of hosts is the God of Angel Armies and if I could title this here tonight I would title it angels are appearing and it's amazing I'm going to read you something here that brother Branham says in the message and I've got quite a few quotes and I hope that's all right here tonight and I probably won't get any more excited than I am right now and so uh just listen up close there won't be a crescendo just have a lot of just want to share personally just how the Lord led me uh but it's it's amazing brother Branham says this and I'm going to read it here in a moment that brother by Adam says that in the ladiesean church age the last age that Angels appear and I thought that was amazing I could highlight it here and I'll have it here for a moment uh here in a moment but I thought it was incredible that 2023 coming into 2023 that the lady is seeing age will have lasted as long as the Ephesian age the Ephesian Church age went for 117 years and in 2023 January 1 I hope I didn't steal your thunder if you're going to share this um this age will have gone as long as the first Age The First Alpha the last Omega and you know brother Branham when he introduces the messenger in the church age book if you read the church age book and at the beginning the messenger brother Baron begins to talk about how that no age really recognized their messenger when he was on the scene but he says but in this age it'll be a quick rapid work and brother Brandon says this he says events will transpire rapidly and so there's an acceleration that happens in this last age I want to read you just a few things brother Ethan if you could put that up here I did get this Logitech remote changed out should be this one right here so it should work for me I'm just going to read through these quickly brother Brandon says in the Harvest time I don't want to bring you conscious of that this is just something uh that I I don't maybe I don't have control might have and I'll get it off okay um brother Branham says this about the Ephesian age and he makes this comment he says that what had happened and he's speaking at the End of the Age after it went off into uh sin and and and and had brother Brandon had said the only thing left was just a little squalid village with a few few Believers left and he said they had forgotten their first love and brother Brandon takes it further than the King James and he says what did that mean it meant that they had lost the glory or The Wonder of their message they had lost the glory and the Wonder so when God comes and he came on the scene in the book of Acts there was a Wonder there was something special about it and he said they had lost that wonder and they had lost that Glory I thought about that here tonight I knew I would just be speaking and I thought if I could do anything in this testimony I just want to remind us of the glory and The Wonder of our message brother Brandon says and I'm gonna just take a few minutes to show you how close that other dimension there's an Angelic Dimension and then there's a demonic Dimension I'm going to show you how close that Dimension is to the dimension that you're living in right now because it's very close we know from the teaching of the message that that that man always lives in a multi-dimensional environment that what you see here physically what you hear here naturally is not all there is to see and that's not all there is to hear but brother Adam says man lives in a multi they talk about a Multiverse or the metaverse it's very real and that's a that's that's not an accident that the metaverse is becoming uh popular as in a buzz thing right now more than ever before virtual reality and remember in countdown brother Brandon points to the making of the automobile as man doing something naturally and God was doing something supernaturally you remember that in countdown talks about the airplane and the the then the the astronaut and the spaceship and so that that metaverse that multi-dimensional realm that science is tapping into and talking about is very real and brother Branham teaches us that if you're a Christian if you're a believer I'm going to make this very simple if you're a Christian and you've been born again that's what it means to be a Christian then when you die you go into the sixth Dimension we know there's seven and that we live here in between a heaven and a hell and the influences from both and brother Brandon says if you're a Believer you go into that sixth Dimension and he says it's a place of paradise it's a place where you're at rest it's a place where you're at peace it's where the dead in Christ go uh to be young people again and young bodies again celestial bodies waiting for the day when the Lord Jesus will return back to this dimension and and brother random says if you die and you go into a theophany then you'll take that theophany and you'll pick up this body that's laying in the dust and you'll raise it up and he says in this body and that body will make up a glorified body and he says and if you're here as Paul said we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed if you're here alive physically at the coming of the Lord then this body that theophany comes to this body vice versa right and so brother random says that if you die you go into that where the dead in Christ go and he says he says that you're in a body that's Incorruptible it's Immortal uh and it's and it's going to be ready to reign with Christ in the new Heaven and the new Earth but he says if you're a unbeliever which is how you were born if you're a sinner who missed or fell to heed the voice of the Lord while you were in Earth if you failed to heed that call not just not just give attention to it but to surrender to That Knocking remember brother random says he's only obligated to knock one time and so he says if you fail to heed to that you never surrendered to that that means that you've rejected the gospel I never rejected the gospel brother Brandon says to reject the the Holy Ghost is to take the mark of the beast and so if you reject that meaning you never surrender to that and you breathe your last breath he says then you go to a place called The Fifth Dimension and brother Madam says it this way says oh it's that horrible Dimension like a nightmare and and and he says where this it's where the souls of the wicked and the imprisoned await that final great white Throne judgment to be judged according to the deeds in their body listen to what the prophet says I want you to be conscious of that before we approach further that God is in this room not in heaven he's in this room now in this room now is coming human beings forms of human beings passing through how I'm going to finish this in 10 minutes is going to be a miracle hope you believe in them passing through here from all around the world voices singing in this room right now but you see you're only limited in your senses to a certain percent of sight then it's got it's got to be somewhere hid from our eyes the same thing is passing through here now has passed through here when Abraham heard God say look up towards the Stars it was when Elijah said on Mount Carmel it was when Adam was here but they just now discovered it and so is God here and the angels where brother Matt in this room and someday it'll be just as much reality or tell as television or anything else because the spirit will bring us this body into that Immortal Life and he says then we'll understand [Applause] president staging my minister in a light matter time and our five senses contact them Dimensions our sight context light our filling context matter but we have contact through science the fourth dimension as it was because coming right through this building now comes pictures voices of radio pictures on television that our senses do not does not contact that yet they have a tube or a crystal that picks up those ether waves and manifests them so you see right in this building right now as live actions of people in the air live voices they're here we know it they're absolutely the truth the only thing that catch it on I don't understand the mechanics of those things science has invented but we know that proves that there's a fourth dimension Now The Fifth Dimension is where the sinner the unbeliever dies and goes to I went into third gear here The Fifth Dimension is the kind of well horrible Dimension now this man when a Christian dies he goes into the sixth Dimension and God is in the seventh Dimension now then you see when a Christian when he dies he goes under the altar of God right into the presence of God Under The Altar and here's what's wonderful and he's at rest to break it down when a man has a nightmare he's not all together asleep neither is he awake he's between asleep and awake and that's what makes him have a horrible shaking and screaming because he's not asleep he's not awake and to take that shows where a man goes when he dies unconverted he's lived his time up he's dead on Earth he can't go into the presence of God because he's not fit to go there without the blood and he's caught he can't come back to earth because he's finished his time and he's caught between he's in a nightmare he can't go into the presence of God to rest he can't come back to earth because as time's up he's in a nightmare and there he stays until the day of judgment a horrible thing to be and see now in this Vision I believe I was caught to that sixth Dimension looking back I could see back he says in sight isn't exactly with the eyes that's Earthly that's became more real to me than it's ever been before sight isn't just what we see here Earthly but sight is greater thing the sight that they have there their contact is far beyond any contact that our natural census would contact Brother random goes and I'm going to read a few of these now the same thing is wrong with you is wrong with that woman sitting over there looking younger I'm going to skip these we're going to have to I had these but that's all right brother Brandon says now friend you may think that's wrong with some of these days you'll realize if you could only take a spiritual Looking Glass and look into your soul you doubt you'd find out what it looks like and the greatest devil and the chief of all Devils is unbelief we got to go and how do you know this is leading of the spirit of God that's where I want to come to and how do you know that we all won't be gone before morning we don't know it you say that worries me it shouldn't frankly it should make you the most happy to know that you're leaving this old pest out there's another world you don't have to leave very far it's right with you it's right with you you don't have to leave very far you just God only give you five senses that's the context so much of this world but there's another world that you haven't got any senses to contact you can't contact it because you don't have it for instance I said Sunday night maybe you didn't get it we got five senses see taste smell uh C taste fill smell in here but what if you didn't have the sight you just had taste fill smelling here somebody received their sight and said there's another world son them them feelings you bump into things you were blind and what is it can tell you what it is why do you think the person was crazy because you don't have that sense of sight nobody ever had it you know of you've heard of people that said such things as that but you doubted but we know by this sense that it's real he's talking about trying to tell a blind person what it means to see and he says but we know by this sense that it's real it's a real place it's a place where you can see your senses declared that now the only thing you do when you die you just change those five senses Glory who you just receive another sense and you're alive with the higher sense thousands of times higher than this in another life a life where there's no death there's no sorrow and the things that you don't know nothing about now you see it plainly when you cross there you don't understand it now because you're bumping into it did we read that right what are we doing when we come into the house of God and the preaching of the word Goes Forth and you fill that atmosphere you're bumping into it you start worshiping the Lord and you feel the presence come down it's a real world it's a real place you can tap into it and he says you bump into it you say I I feel a strange feeling here tonight looks to me like there's I just want to cry or shout or something it's the angels of the Lord see this is the junction of time Angels appear in the end time all the prophets signpost points saying this day that angels will appear prophets will arise signs and wonders and if God did that for those little Junctions back there what will he do now when all hell turned loose all heaven will turn loose and then he says it again Angels appearing signs and wonders on Earth encounterfeits arise and God proving which is right and wrong amen can I go in overtime is that all right just for a few minutes I got the pastor approval some of his time Angels appearing I want to testify just for a moment about something that took place very unexpectedly to me and uh would maybe I'm just gonna speak just as I'm just going to say it because if I think too much about it it'll I'll I'll spend a lot more time trying to tell it but something took place when I was in just here recently we went out to minister for brother Dale and I think might be streaming here tonight and uh went out there to minister in Flagstaff and I I was there in the office just preparing for the Sunday morning service I had preached that morning and uh and they were singing in the back the worship service and I was going to preach the same thought that I preached here the last time I spoke anointed by the Supernatural and I spoke on that in three parts I think here and I Was preparing just as I normally would for any time I was going to preach just in the back nothing unnormal praying and waiting on the Lord meditating seeking the Lord and I was just back there in brother Dale's office and they were singing and there's a window right in front of the as you sit at the desk there and then there's a leather chair as you're sitting you got the computer here in a big window you can look out beautiful Flagstaff fair and then there's a leather chair here and a leather chair here and a desk and I was just there um uh preparing and and I Was preparing my notes and I and the Lord just put it upon my heart because I was going to testify about the man Marcus Humphrey brother Travis's friend who was healed of stage four Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and I was going to give that testimony and I had some of his photos in my PowerPoint slides and I was just making going throughs they were singing I wasn't really there was a screen there where that I could see if I wanted to the audience and I could hear very quietly what they were singing it was just there preparing my notes and and the Lord just Holy Spirit just spoke to me and said add because in that testimony Marcus I testified to his wife Mary about sister Elena butts from uh evening light at brother Tim Pruitt's Church how that she was also diagnosed with the same stage for Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and when I told that to his wife and showed her the pet scans of her and now you have Marcus and so the you could just feel the faith in that that living room rise when we when we started to testify about that so I thought I'm going to share those pictures so I I went to get get on I knew that it was on Elena's sister Elena's Facebook I'd read it she testifies every year about the same time as an annual anniversary and so I went on there and I'm pulling down the notes and I paste them into my notes and I'm reading them and she's starting to testify about how that I went to church that Sunday morning and the doctor said giving me this diagnosis and something was very different about that day and they they were singing this song leaning on the Everlasting and as I'm reading those words that I that I had pasted leaning on the Everlasting Arms uh my my my mind went in sync with the brother who was singing the song service leaning on the Everlasting Arms word for word and at that moment that was enough to make me well you know thankful and thank Lord that's just a supernatural confirmation I'm about to go out here and preach this and as I'm reading this he's singing it and it was just right at that moment something happened it's beyond any anything that's ever happened to me before supernaturally I've spoken in tongues many times I've testified about that here and was one of the most Supernatural experiences I've ever had out of the body kind of experience um the first time meaning it's I've spoken tongues many times since then but that first initial time was just something so special about it I thought I'll never never could could how could you ever criticize that so wonderful and and but this what happened this far outweighs that and just in that moment through the left window a whirlwind just came right through the window and when it came through it and it sat right on the leather chair and I knew it was the angel of the Lord and I can't I don't have words I could describe but I don't have I don't I would be I was speechless at the time and the moment that it took place and I and I just sat there and and I'm going to say this let me just say this I never physically with my two eyes seen anything seen seen seen the angel of the Lord but I what I seen supernaturally was greater than anything I can see here looking at your faces that's why I said when brother Brandon says sight is not just limited to Earthly it's no way to describe it never had anything happen like it but that I I said it I think to my wife this way what came through that window was not a presence it was a person and when it sat on that chair that leather chair right there I couldn't speak I was I was scared I was so so scared I I told my dad immediately after I got out and I texted him a long text I said I have to tell you about what happened I have no explanation for it I said I was so frightened I was shaking I was so scared but I said but maybe scared isn't the right word but yet it is the right word I wasn't fearful it wasn't no fear inside of me but there was a fear not a someone said maybe like a reverence that's not what it was it was like a fear it was it was it was a I was scared hard to start it's like an oxymoron but it was just the Lord there and I knew at that moment what it felt to me was that the Lord said I'm coming to take charge right now and in a way that's never happened I don't have any time I've ever preached the gospel the Lord just took charge right there in that moment very very special moment there wasn't no anxiety there wasn't no fear like that but it was just a a something there that I I couldn't then when I finally could speak I'd have started crying uncontrollably I mean just pouring weeping my heart out before I could even get words out and I thought for a moment if they call me out right now I'm not going to be able to go out to preach right now I couldn't I was not in a state where I could speak and and and and I just felt the presence of the Lord there in that moment and I I don't know why the Lord did it I I've I as I said I preached on that what I've preached here I don't know why he did it was very unexpected the way that it happened but I just I texted my dad I said I don't even know hardly what to say right now I'm in the office now after preaching and and and it was I just for that moment when I knew that the Lord was there I just said Lord I'm just gonna I know you're here and I felt like I know that you're here for a mission for somebody but can I just have a moment Lord to give you some of my needs just in this moment and I begin to just to pour my heart out to the Lord and I remember standing up and when I went out to the platform I still was real broken up couldn't hardly even speak I knew the Lord was still there and I opened the door and I got a text as I as I got done preaching and it was from a brother from Georgia very well-known good friend of mine and his daughter happened to be visiting in Flagstaff and she was in that service I didn't know who she was he said brother Matt and he didn't know he wasn't at the service he said brother Maddie said I I wanted to testify to you about something that happened he says my daughter who's not a extremely emotional person he said when the door opened and you walked out he said a presence came and my daughter said Dad I just started crying uncontrollably I couldn't help it he hadn't even said the first word and she said I was just weeping and bawling at that moment sister Joanne said she was in the hospital with brother Dale and she had a supernatural experience there in the hospital room another sister after the service tech accident said I had a she was streaming from home she says and I I don't know if the sister this is something uh maybe unique to her but she texted and just sister Joanna she said at home as brother Matt started speaking I started speaking in unknown tongues and it just wouldn't stop I know the Lord was doing something special at that moment I received multiple uh testimonies after that have since then of Supernatural healings one of arthritis arthritic pain in the hand another the girl who was up there I didn't know that was her uh there in the prayer line but when she came up for prayer I knew all I can describe my only way I can say it the only reason I even testify about this it surely isn't to say anything about me at all it's just if I could do anything and that's to increase our faith to say angels are appearing angels are appearing that Dimension is pressing into this dimension and I and I knew when I was there in that prayer line I just they would speak their needs and I said you told him he heard you say it now we're going to pray I I left there as I as I said I'm going to end right here but I struggled I remember leaving walking back to the back office and I struggled to even leave the office I couldn't leave it's like I didn't want to I didn't want to leave that that office and I just stared at that chair that was there you say brother Matt what does it mean it means that God is here the devil is here demons are here angels are here and brother Branham says it in one place brother Joe shared this with me months ago how brother I quote where brother Branham Says angels are here trying to accumulate faith demons are here trying to accumulate doubt but angels are here trying to energize your faith I just raised my hand and say Lord let Angels energize me if that's their desire here tonight to press in how many would say that with a hand and say Lord may your angels come and minister to my family to my children to my home sicknesses mental health physical health emotional health I want to be a recipient of it right now give the Lord a handclap [Applause] my my you love the Lord the um services like this you you almost just say my we need a full service for everything we heard tonight and it's been a great privilege for me to hear that I was glad to hear that testimony I remember ironically um Matt texted me that on the Sunday morning and I had just testified to you that Sunday morning we had just dismissed only a little while when I got the text from him saying he had a supernatural experience and I thought that he must have heard the testimony I gave about the place I went in prayer and took all of y'all with me and we went into a pavilion amen and that same day my son was also having and and I got outside that day and other brothers were saying you know amazingly just recently a strange thing happened to me brother Joe was telling me laying on his couch and some different things happening I got some texts and phone calls from other people saying this that or the other I'm going to tell you something friends we're close we're close we're close I I was thinking about all I heard tonight I thought my I'm gonna I'm never gonna forget the word Focus that was amazing you know I I loved brother Joe's very first when he's um he's is that an acronym or an acrostic but he's work he's using the F in focus and he starts out with forgiveness and you know what a lot of people don't realize is you know this is the I mean this is the age of perfect love this is what we're to come to and that cast out fear and that that paves the way for forgiveness because we've been forgiven for so much and I I was I've said in all in pulpits around the globe reminding people that there are two unpardonable Sins not just one one is to blaspheme the Holy Ghost but the other sin that is not forgivable is the refusal to forgive because Jesus said if you won't forgive your brother his trespasses your heavenly father will not forgive you your trespasses and so to forgive is not only a privilege but a requirement my goodness I I I I thought I thought I was going to take off and and blast off uh with brother Joe and then brother Brad comes up behind it and ever it seemed like everything that was coming was conducive to the thought that's even on my heart for tonight and you know I I kept reminding myself of that quote where brother Brad was talking about us I I wish I could have found that quote and hand it to him real fast where brother Branham talks about that he says listen there will be no peace till Jesus comes you just Mark that down you say why does every age get worse because it has to a prophet was saying that in 1964 1965 he says I'll tell you something it will get thus saith the Lord it'll get worse and worse and worse it cannot get better the world is shaking and so I I just I agreed with my brother tonight I said Shake Me Lord oh I need a shaking from the Lord my and and the good news I I thought about brother Brad when you were talking about good news and bad news and I I remember years ago when uh the boy the boys used to listen to that Odyssey and um you know um the uh the end and all that and uh what's in and and you remember Eugene and Eugene he ran in one day and he said hey guys I got some good news and some news that pretty well cancels the good news oh my I thought about it you know I thought about it doesn't matter what good news they have you know they can say the stock market's up but I got news that'll kind of cancel that say oh the Democrats are saying oh we held on to the Senate that's fine but I got news that'll kind of cancel that the Republicans say we took the house well I got news that's going to kind of cancel that good news the world is perishing and it must get worse and worse I'm glad that I can give you some news tonight that there's no downside to oh my there's no bad news to the coming of the lord The Rapture his own friends my my my my I thought about um I thought about brother Matt I tell you brother Matt I have never thought about that here here I mean the way especially the way Matt says it he has that Dr Smith way and he says you know the battle only took five minutes and as soon as he said that I already knew what was coming I just about fell on the floor he said but then he carried it for 14 hours five minutes versus 14 hours friends I hope you caught that tonight I hope you realize that the City of Refuge is just in front of you whatever you've been carrying don't let the devil Humanity has a terrible propensity for to worry about things and fret over them of things that happened years ago you can't do anything about it the City of Refuge is in front of you throw it down don't let that hang on you you're you're entitled to be free it's your inheritance [Music] my throw those Gates Down Let It Go Hebron is just before you brother Caleb blew my mind with that one brother no matter your season I took such courage from that no matter your season can I say to you today don't fight your season you know why because you're fighting nature and God works in nature so don't fight Seasons that's the way God does like brother Caleb said You know here here's something I'd like to eat it all at once but God brings it out and makes you go through it God's working out something in our lives but here's the beautiful part there's always higher ground your season might be different from mine but I got Higher Ground you got Higher Ground oh I'm not fighting the seasons anymore friends I just say Lord whatever season you need me to go through I'm not going to fight it because that's fighting God because you're fighting nature nature comes in Seasons God doesn't even grow a blade of grass overnight my goodness oh I I had did the math myself some fairly recently when I started looking at the laodicean age because brother Brown talks about it was the shortest of all the ages and that's absolutely true because for the church the whole age is already closed to them that that whole denominational system is sealed away under judgment we're only stretching out history because there's not an eighth historical age see so so absolutely that that age uh for the church was very short but our historical age and I and I had recently did the math myself and I said my goodness we're right on the cusp of the Alpha and the Omega coming into perfect blending do you know something friends I was I was um watching a documentary on the History Channel and they were talking about because it reminded me because Matt was saying he read the quote and showed us where this is the time where angels are appearing and you know there's they're all a buzz now and governments never before governments always they always wouldn't talk about you know unidentified objects in the heavens aerial aerial objects whatever they've even changed the acronym now it's not UFO it's something else now UFA or something like that and and now governments are confessing it and and even the United States government and our allies are now actually talking about these things are real and they're trying to get to the bottom of it and we've got a prophet who knew what they were a half century ago you'd never convinced them but that's okay I don't need to convince them amen say you know people people people aren't so convinced about your faith my faith doesn't require them to be amen praise the Lord friends for me it's it's not a matter of who's right and who's wrong I know whom I have believed amen and I I and and I you know they they are I was and on this on this history documentary they were talking about this the new super collider I forget where it's at seemed like it's somewhere in the Scandinavian countries somewhere in Europe they've got that super collider and you know what they're doing you know what they're using that for right now they're studying dimensions they're aware there's more than just light time and matter and there's more than our five senses contact and their science is now trying to unlock it we're close we're close friends we're very very close amen I uh I'm not going to go into my thought tonight I've got permission from the Lord to put it off till in the morning that's my advantage I get I get I get all the time I want tomorrow but how many have enjoyed my the presence of the Lord give these brothers a hand amen praise the Lord um so um Matt I'm thinking that that what we might do because I told the musicians they like to come down with when their families come up for the table and uh so instead of bringing them back up at all once the communion starts maybe we could just play the pre-service music can that work yeah okay we'll do that amen you know friends it's a grand privilege to come to the Lord's Supper and I I I don't ever I don't ever want the Lord's Supper to be you know something that we just take haphazardly it's really not ever to be that you know the Lord's Supper is something of a special occasion for us you know and I you know it's uh it's what's amazing is is that it's a TR it's not just a tradition but it's an ordinance of the church that Jesus said in motion and said you should keep doing this and brother Branham said those those were three ordinances and that that he left us was water baptism and communion and foot washing and you know so the Lord's Supper then has a function in the same way for believers today I want you to get your mind around that it has the same function for believers today that it had for believers two thousand years ago because you know the only thing that separates you from Simon Peter and James and Paul and all of those who used to take the Lord's Supper when they were in the upper room with Jesus and even going into the New Testament era and they took the Lord's Supper do you know the only thing that separates you from them time other than that you are in that same family you are we are all enjoined by the blood of Jesus Christ back to God through faith isn't that a beautiful thing that's not just a metaphor friends that the the records of Heaven record you as Sons and Daughters of God my and so it's done in remembrance we know that that it's done in remembrance of the Lord and and it is it is a it is a it is a kind of a kind of continual Proclamation it is a way of testifying it's a way of coming to the Lord's table together it's amazing and I've I've noticed it over the years how many um times in various churches this church included in other churches I've been at and and been a part of other churches and and and even even churches I visited how that not everybody will come to the Lord's table and it's it's a sadness there for that because this is this is one of the other than your water baptism taking the name of the Lord Jesus Christ could you imagine could you imagine saying I'm a Christian could you imagine claiming you were a Christian and you refuse to be baptized and you just said I don't need to do that and you never went to the water you never gathered as a public witness with God's family and was willing to go to the water and take the name of the Lord Jesus Christ in baptism communion and foot washing are the three ordinances together water baptism communion and foot washing and there will be people who are willing to get baptized and claim to be a believer but who will never come to the Lord's table it is important it is vitally important and you know if it wasn't important the Lord wouldn't have set the order you ever think about that the Lord the Lord didn't do things you know without reason he didn't operate redundantly he didn't do things without cause and without purpose he didn't entertain he didn't do any of those things he he brought them together for a purpose and when we come together and we're going to read about it in First Corinthians 11 here in a moment but but you know this as we come to this ordinance I believe that it has a strengthening quality to it I believe it strengthens our faith because we're coming together in observation of the Lord's broken body and the blood he said that's not a small thing that's not a small thing it reinforces not only does it strengthen our faith but it reinforces the good news of the Gospel not only that but it brings us together listen friends if it doesn't accomplish one other thing it brings us together in love it brings us together in harmony to come and take the Lord's supper and meet at the table together as a family of God and then we go and we wash one another's feet why because that's an expression of Brotherly Love well you know when brother Branham went beyond and that voice said to him this is what you always preached was the Holy Ghost Divine love amen we're going to change the order of the service now and I'm going to ask brother Luther to come forward and make make ready um I tell you what brother Andrew why don't you come back to the piano and just you and we'll we'll let you play and then once the uh once um everything gets going then we'll switch over to the music let's turn in our Bibles to First Corinthians 11 please if you will just play for us softly brother Andrew First Corinthians 11 and we'll begin reading at verse 23. Paul said for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me so it's remembering the Lord it's a time to come together to consecrate ourselves consecrate our hearts and remember the sacrifice the lord gave verse 25. after the same manner also he took the cup when he had stopped saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord I love these next verses but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup what up what a release from a an ominous verse prior because look friends the bottom line is that none of us feel Worthy I don't care how long you've been a Christian the sometimes the longer you've been a Christian this might sound amazing but sometimes the longer you've been a Christian the more evidence the devil's got against you because you've had that many more times to stumble when you were a sinner you just you weren't you didn't commit sins when you were a sinner you just were in sin only a Christian brother Brown said only a Christian commits sins but sinner just is sin he's just living in sin it's not measured that way but once we give our heart to the Lord then you know I just want to say tonight this next verse when I read where it says to me examine yourself and then eat I just want to say to you tonight examine yourself before the Lord and throw those Gates down throw them down examine yourself before the Lord say what's my examination say Lord here I am tonight and maybe I've had this failure and that failure and every kind of failure but Lord tonight I've come under the examination of your word I'm going to admit I've been wrong and I'm going to ask you to forgive me and I'm going to ask you to help me and I'm going to throw those Gates down I'm going to walk into the City of Refuge and I'm going to take the Lord's supper and so let him eat I love that my for he that is for this call he says he says verse 27 wherefore whosoever shall eat of this bread and drink of this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily Edith and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this calls many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be here's the good news that we should not be condemned with the world not beautiful aren't you glad for that today let's stand to our feet amen I want to sing a chord of this there is a fountain is that what you're playing there is a fountain filled live with blood drawn from emmanuels my my and sinners blood be beneath that flood here it is all there guilty stay in that beautiful oh lose all all their gift Hallelujah Lord oh my oh they lose all their gifty stands and sinners plus be beneath beneath that flood lose all their gifts Hallelujah don't you love him let's bow our heads [Music] father before us are the articles prepared and

Chapter 13 John's gospel chapter 13. verse 1. now before the Feast of the Passover when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the father having loved his own which were in the world he loved them unto the end that's such a beautiful way of saying it and supper being ended the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot Simon's son to betray him Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he was come from God and went to God he riseth from supper laid aside his garments and took a towel and girded himself after that he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded then cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter saith unto him Lord Dost thou wash my feet Jesus answered and said unto him what I do thou knowest not now but Thou shalt know hereafter Peter saith unto him Thou shalt never wash my feet Jesus answered him if I wash thee not thou has no part with me Simon Peter saith unto him Lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head Jesus saith to him he that is washed needeth not saved to wash his feet but is clean every wit and you're clean but not all for he knew who should betray him therefore said he ye are not all clean so after he had washed their feet and had taken his garments and was set down again he said unto them know ye what I have done unto you done to you you call me master and Lord and you say well for so I am if I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet you also ought to wash one another's feet for I have given you an example that ye should do as I have done to you verily verily I say unto you the servant is not greater than his Lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him if

friends I was reflecting about 2023 thinking to myself no one no one thought such a thing I can tell you raised up in this my whole life since a child been ministering around the world for a long time and I can tell you I've set in ministers meetings everywhere in churches everywhere and heard sermons so many sermons in my lifetime no one thought anyone would ever say it's 2023. no one no one and I thought about that and I realized the Lord said you know kind of had to be that way because I said I'd come in the hour you'd think not and the one I had to wait till no one thought it would ever be that and that's when I could come so praise the Lord whatever 2023 holds if it holds the Rapture remember the other day I was preaching and I spun my calendar around I started just spinning through days and I said how do we know but where there it went we might just pass by you know when the bride leaves here the world will go right on time will just go right on brother Brandon said they'll they'll keep going to church they'll sing songs they'll preach they'll even come to the altar in Repentance and thinking they're getting saved and it's already the rapture's already come and gone he said one of these days they'll say well wasn't this supposed to happen wasn't that supposed to happen Prophet said they'll hear a voice speak out of the air and say it's already happened and you didn't know it I'm glad to be on the on the no in the know I'm glad to be in the know amen I know my redeemer liveth I know whom I have believed amen you can know the Bible says that you can know that
