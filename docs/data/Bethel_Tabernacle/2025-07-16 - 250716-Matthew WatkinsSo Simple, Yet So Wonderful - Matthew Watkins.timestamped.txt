[21:36] tighten myself. So, I got to fight in
[21:37] the morning. I got to drive back about
[21:38] four hours and a half. So, I thank
[21:40] brother Jason the uh the opportunity to
[21:43] come and meet him and uh and uh have a
[21:46] good fellowship with him today. I want
[21:48] to say I love each one of you. This is

[21:52] you. Some of you I do know. Uh God bless
[21:55] you. I love you. And uh if you passing

[22:08] information out of there. God bless you.

[22:45] time and not such a tight schedule.

[26:12] to have your perfect way, Lord Jesus. We
[26:14] just give you full reign now, Lord. Full
[26:17] sway, Lord, as we sang this song, Lord.
[26:19] It's just a message that comes from the
[26:21] heart of your children tonight. Lord, we
[26:24] don't put you in any kind of a box or
[26:26] preconceived idea, Lord, but we just
[26:29] give you liberty and freedom just now.
[26:32] May you move, Lord God, by your spirit,
[26:34] Lord. I pray that you would help me,
[26:36] Lord, not just to preach, Lord, but
[26:39] there's something greater than just
[26:40] preaching a good sermon, but to
[26:42] minister, Lord, Father, and that's such
[26:44] a difference when your spirit can come
[26:46] and minister to your children, Lord. You
[26:49] can change lives that way. you can make
[26:51] the difference in our life. I pray God
[26:54] that you would come and be the unseen
[26:55] guest amongst us, Lord. Now that we've
[26:57] gathered, Lord, we've sang songs. We've
[27:00] worshiped you, Lord. Father, and we've
[27:02] come with that purpose, Lord, to lift
[27:04] you up. Help us to do that, Jesus, to
[27:07] lift you up, Lord God. For you said, if
[27:09] I be lifted up, I'll draw all men unto
[27:13] me. Lord, we've came with that purpose.
[27:16] We didn't come to glorify a man, but we
[27:19] came to glorify the name of Jesus. I
[27:22] pray, God, that you would receive our
[27:23] worship, receive our praise. Lord, we

[28:48] we're glad to have you here. Amen.
[28:50] Anybody else streaming? We just um want
[28:51] to say God bless you. Let's just begin
[28:54] reading here in Acts chapter 2. We'll
[28:55] just begin at verse one. And when the
[28:58] day of Pentecost was fully come, they
[29:01] were all with one accord in one place.
[29:05] Amen.
[29:05] &gt;&gt; And suddenly there came a sound from
[29:08] heaven, as of a rushing mighty wind, and
[29:10] it filled all the house where they were
[29:12] sitting. And there appeared unto them
[29:14] cloven tongues like as a fire, and it
[29:16] sat upon each of them. And they were all
[29:19] filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to
[29:22] speak with other tongues, as the Spirit
[29:24] gave them utterance. And there were
[29:26] dwelling at Jerusalem, Jews, devout men,
[29:28] out of every nation under heaven. Now
[29:30] when this was noised abroad, the
[29:32] multitude came together and were
[29:33] confounded because that every man heard
[29:36] them speak in his own language. They
[29:38] were all amazed and marveled, saying one
[29:39] to another, "Behold, are not all these
[29:41] which speak Galileans? How here we every
[29:44] man in our own tongue wherein we were
[29:46] born?" Let's just move on down to verse
[29:49] 13. Others mocking. Isn't it amazing
[29:53] that there's always this parallel?
[29:56] Whenever there's a the spirit of God
[29:58] moves, there are those who rejoice and
[30:02] there are those who mock.
[30:04] &gt;&gt; Others mocking said, "These men are full
[30:07] of new wine." But Peter standing up with
[30:10] the 11 lifted up his voice and said unto
[30:14] them, "You men of Judea, and all you
[30:17] that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known
[30:19] unto you, and hearken to my words. For
[30:22] these are not drunken as you suppose,
[30:24] seeing that it is but the third hour of
[30:25] the day, but this is that which was
[30:28] spoken by the prophet Joel. And it shall
[30:31] come to pass in the last days, sayaeth
[30:33] God. I will pour out my spirit upon all
[30:35] flesh. Your sons and your daughters
[30:37] shall prophesy. Your young men shall see
[30:40] visions, and your old men shall dream
[30:42] dreams. and on my servants and on my
[30:44] handmaidaidens I will pour out in those
[30:46] days of my spirit and they shall
[30:49] prophesy and I will show wonders in
[30:52] heaven above signs in the earth beneath
[30:54] blood and fire and vapor of smoke and
[30:58] the sun shall be turned into darkness
[30:59] and the moon into blood before the great
[31:01] and notable day of the Lord come. Ye
[31:05] men, verse 22, of Nazareth, notice this.
[31:07] Ye men of Israel, hear these words.
[31:09] Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God
[31:12] among you by miracles and wonders and
[31:15] signs which God did by him in the midst
[31:18] of you, as you yourself know, him being
[31:21] delivered by the determinate counsel and
[31:23] fornowledge of God, you have taken, and
[31:26] by wicked hands have crucified and
[31:28] slain, whom God hath raised up. Aren't
[31:32] you glad for that? having loosed the
[31:34] pains of death because it was not
[31:36] possible that he should beholden of it.
[31:40] You can be seated here tonight as you
[31:42] have your seats if you can just turn
[31:43] also to the book of Jude. We just want
[31:45] to read just a few scriptures here and
[31:47] just unburden our heart as the Lord has
[31:50] just um
[31:52] um
[31:54] dealt with me so this this uh today uh
[31:57] this entire week actually and then today
[31:59] just uh sitting before the Lord knowing
[32:01] I would minister tonight. We just want
[32:03] to um want to set our timer here. You
[32:06] forgive me. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[32:11] Jude chapter 1. I want you to read this
[32:14] very familiar with me. If you have your
[32:15] Bible, we'll just keep it turned there.
[32:17] Don't just let me read it to you. But if
[32:19] you could read it with me, they could
[32:20] also display it on the screen. Notice
[32:23] here in ver Jude uh verse, we'll just
[32:25] begin reading at verse three. Behold,
[32:28] beloved, when I gave all diligence to
[32:30] write unto you of the common salvation.
[32:33] Now, I want you just to fast forward
[32:35] because what we just read about is
[32:37] exactly what Jude is referring to. That
[32:41] when I was going to give diligence to
[32:43] write unto you of the common salvation,
[32:47] he uses this word in uh specifically
[32:50] that this is the original faith that was
[32:53] once delivered to the saints. Brother
[32:56] Brandham said that it was one time
[32:58] preached, one one one time was delivered
[33:01] by Peter. And you know the quote where
[33:04] the prophet says when Peter gave that
[33:06] inauguration that when the church was
[33:08] inaugurated on the day of Pentecost and
[33:10] Peter preached that first sermon. And so
[33:13] Jude is going to now write about it. And
[33:15] notice because we fast forward all the
[33:17] way to the very end what we could say of
[33:20] this uh Ephesian age. And notice what
[33:24] Jude says. When I gave diligence to
[33:27] write unto you of the common salvation,
[33:29] it was necessary, needful, important for
[33:32] me to write unto you and to exhort you
[33:35] that you should earnestly contend for
[33:38] the faith which was once delivered unto
[33:41] the saints. I think it's powerful that
[33:43] Jude is already going to tell you
[33:45] there's going to be a struggle. There's
[33:49] going to be a battle.
[33:50] &gt;&gt; There's going to be a fight. And you're
[33:52] going to have to earnestly contend for
[33:56] the faith. Notice this. Which was once
[33:59] delivered unto the saints. For there are
[34:01] certain men crept in unaware who were
[34:04] before of old ordained to this
[34:05] condemnation. Ungodly men. If you could
[34:08] change whatever you just did back to
[34:10] whatever it was because I was hearing
[34:12] myself good until then. Thank you,
[34:13] brother. For notice this. There are
[34:15] certain men crept in unawares who were
[34:16] before of old ordained to this
[34:18] condemnation. Ungodly men. Notice
[34:21] turning the grace of our God into
[34:23] lasciviousness and denying the only Lord
[34:26] God and our Lord Jesus Christ. Notice I
[34:30] will therefore put you in remembrance
[34:32] though you once knew this though you
[34:35] once knew this how that the Lord having
[34:37] saved the people out of the land of
[34:39] Egypt afterward destroyed destroyed them
[34:42] that believe not. The angels which kept
[34:45] not their first estate but left their
[34:48] own habitation. He hath reserved in
[34:51] everlasting chains under darkness unto
[34:54] the judgment of the great day. So the
[34:58] prophet of God picks this up and he
[34:59] talks about these fallen angels. Now
[35:02] remember that an angel, a demon spirit
[35:05] is just a fallen angel. And the prophet
[35:08] of God would say that what happened to
[35:10] Luther's message. And in every revival,
[35:12] it was this way that fallen angels would
[35:15] come in and they would hybrid the
[35:18] original truth that God had sent. And
[35:20] that hybridization of the word was never
[35:22] a rejection of the word, but it was a
[35:25] dumbing down or a watering down of what
[35:28] was originally sent. I want you to pick
[35:31] this up because it's very key to
[35:33] understand that what Jude is telling
[35:35] them is not that there were men that had
[35:38] crept in unaware and had started saying
[35:40] that Jesus didn't come and and Jesus
[35:43] didn't this is not even those who were
[35:45] denying the resurrection. But actually
[35:47] what Jude is warning them of is that
[35:49] there were men or spirits of men that
[35:53] had crept into the church because notice
[35:55] it wasn't just the men but Jude points
[35:58] to the angels. I'll give you the words
[35:59] of a prophet. God takes his man but he
[36:02] never takes his spirit. And did you know
[36:05] brother Brandham said I was hearing it
[36:06] today that the devil also takes his man
[36:09] but he keeps his spirit. So all the
[36:12] spirits that we see here today that are
[36:14] manifested in the end time that we live
[36:16] in. What didn't originate here. They go
[36:19] all the way back to the to Genesis the
[36:21] seed chapter in the very beginning. So
[36:24] what we're dealing with today is not a
[36:26] different spirit than they dealt with in
[36:27] the book of Jude. What we're dealing
[36:29] with today in the world that we see a in
[36:32] religious circles and and and and and
[36:35] you know those who claim to be uh
[36:37] believers of the faith is not something
[36:39] that started with the dawning of
[36:41] technology or the internet or social
[36:43] media. But I will say this, this is the
[36:46] maturity of all of those spirits.
[36:50] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen tonight? So, what
[36:52] you're dealing with today is an
[36:54] original. As we said before, you know,
[36:56] you could look all the way back to any
[36:58] spirit you want to name here tonight.
[37:00] The spirit of suicide, the spirit of
[37:02] homosexuality, the spirit of lust, the
[37:04] spirit of of of depression. Listen,
[37:07] those aren't new things. Those are
[37:09] ancient things that have only been
[37:11] exemplified or magnified by that fourth
[37:15] dimension or that dimension of science.
[37:17] Because now sin is more accessible than
[37:20] it's ever been before. Listen friends,
[37:22] if you want to if you want to doubt uh
[37:25] you know to live a life of sin, it's
[37:27] right at your fingertips. You don't have
[37:29] to, you know, go way down and hide in,
[37:31] you know, and find go somewhere way way,
[37:33] you know, buried somewhere. It's right
[37:34] out in the open. It's right in your
[37:36] face. And and sin is more accessible
[37:39] than it's ever been before because the
[37:41] spirit of the antichrist is more mature
[37:44] than he's ever been before. He's at his
[37:47] zenith. He's at this is Satan's Eden.
[37:49] This is the maturity of all seeds. So
[37:52] the spirit as before that would hide in
[37:54] the darkness or hide somewhere or be
[37:57] subliminal as Satan would try to move in
[37:59] subtly and subliminally. Listen friends,
[38:01] can I just go ahead and expose the
[38:03] devil? He He's very bold. He's right out
[38:06] in your face.
[38:07] &gt;&gt; Say, "Brother Matt, boy, you're a bold
[38:08] you you're bold sometimes with the
[38:10] things you say." That's because we've
[38:11] got a bold enemy. And my kids are facing
[38:14] a bold spirit. It's in the school
[38:17] systems. It's in not it's invaded not
[38:19] just the government, friends. It's
[38:21] invaded religious circles. It's invaded
[38:24] our music. It's invaded Hollywood. It's
[38:26] invaded our entertainment. And the devil
[38:29] is now more bold and in your face than
[38:32] he's ever been before. Listen friends, I
[38:35] just happen to believe that if the
[38:37] Antichrist spirit is bold right out in
[38:40] your face and is manifesting his works
[38:42] across all of the, you know, the world
[38:44] that we see, I just happen to believe
[38:46] that if that's what's happening in an
[38:49] underworld with demons, how much more is
[38:51] a spiritual angelic host wanting to
[38:55] manifest themselves bold as the prophet
[38:58] of God said, "When all hell cuts loose,
[39:01] all heavens cuts loose.
[39:04] And so we're living in that that age,
[39:06] that maturing of all seeds. What we see
[39:08] today, as we said, is ancient. It's only
[39:10] more mature than it's ever been before.
[39:13] Notice here in Jud, I just want to make
[39:15] sure I keep my train of thought uh and
[39:17] not not to deviate from it. I'll get in
[39:19] the weeds really quick. And I want to
[39:20] stay right right here with what the Lord
[39:23] uh I want to be faithful to what he's
[39:24] given me. And so notice here, he says
[39:27] here, and and I just want to read some
[39:28] of these. We'll skip some of them, but I
[39:30] want to show you just this uh if we
[39:32] could say this pattern because I believe
[39:34] if you can see it here in Jude, your
[39:36] your spiritual mind will catch what's
[39:38] taking place today. Notice here,
[39:41] likewise, verse 8, likewise the filthy
[39:43] dreamers defile the flesh, despise
[39:46] dominion, speak evil of dignities.
[39:48] Notice in verse uh 10, but these speak
[39:51] evil of those things which they know
[39:54] not. Notice this. But what they know
[39:58] naturally.
[40:01] &gt;&gt; So this is what he when you type when
[40:03] you click on this word this uh Greek
[40:05] word here naturally it's asnosis. It's
[40:09] the knowledge of man. It's knowledge or
[40:12] what they know intellectually or what
[40:15] they know academically or what they know
[40:18] scientifically. So he says they speak
[40:21] evil of those things which they know
[40:23] not. speaking of spiritual things
[40:25] because they're not spiritual. They're
[40:27] carnally minded, but they try to speak
[40:29] of spiritual things. Listen friends, if
[40:31] you are not born of the spirit of God,
[40:34] you can't even see the kingdom of God.
[40:36] It's what Jesus said. Unless you're born
[40:38] of the spirit of God, you can't even see
[40:40] the kingdom of God. So naturally, if
[40:43] they were never born of the spirit of
[40:45] that kingdom, then to speak, they would
[40:47] be speaking evil of those things which
[40:49] they know not. But what they know
[40:51] intellectually by education, by science,
[40:54] by observation, by rational critical
[40:57] thinking, this is exactly what what
[40:59] Judah is saying here is what they know,
[41:01] what they've garnered or by knowledge or
[41:04] what they've learned or what they've
[41:06] studied or what they've educated
[41:08] themselves. You know, let me just say it
[41:10] here today. You can know this Bible
[41:12] intellectually from the front cover to
[41:14] the back cover and not know the Lord
[41:16] Jesus. You could know this message with
[41:19] from the first tape to the very last
[41:21] tape and never meet the me. You could
[41:24] hear them all about the messenger and
[41:26] never hear the true message that is
[41:28] coming from that vindicated prophet. Can
[41:30] you say amen? You can know the word
[41:33] front to back but not know the author.
[41:36] You could know it intellectually. You
[41:38] could observe it scientifically. You
[41:40] could know it from Sunday school and and
[41:42] and believe that you know about him. But
[41:45] to know him is life.
[41:47] &gt;&gt; To know him is liberty. Can I get any
[41:50] Christians to help testify tonight to
[41:52] say to know Jesus is freedom. To know
[41:55] Jesus is true peace. To know the Lord
[41:58] Jesus is real satisfaction.
[42:03] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[42:03] &gt;&gt; Notice he says here, "Woe unto them.
[42:05] They speak what they know as brute be as
[42:08] brute beast and those things they
[42:09] corrupt themselves. Woe unto them for
[42:11] they've gone in the way of Cain." Ah,
[42:13] there's a key point. They've gone in the
[42:15] way of Cain. Remember, brother Vandom
[42:17] said Cain was just as religious as Abel
[42:20] was. And I'll go further because in
[42:22] another place he said he was more
[42:23] religious than Abel was.
[42:24] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[42:26] &gt;&gt; He he wanted to worship God. He came
[42:28] with the sacrifice. There were two
[42:30] altars in the beginning and one was
[42:32] accepted and one was rejected. And can I
[42:35] say today there are again two altars,
[42:39] two approaches and one is accepted and
[42:41] one is rejected. Can I say that in this
[42:45] in this altar that we have today, it is
[42:47] beautiful. It is it is it is it it's uh
[42:50] aromatic. It smells very nice. It's
[42:54] plausible. It's rational.
[42:57] This approach to Christ, this approach
[42:59] to the throne, it makes human knowledge,
[43:03] intellectual sense. Abel's way didn't
[43:06] make any sense. In fact, if you look at
[43:08] it, Cain had a much more reasonable
[43:11] appealing to your own logic. Come on,
[43:14] somebody.
[43:15] &gt;&gt; Cain had a much more
[43:18] uh you know, you you just go ahead and
[43:19] say it. Cain's made a lot more sense
[43:21] than Abel's. You notice it makes sense
[43:24] for us to look at Abel's offer. Now I
[43:26] slayed a lamb. He had blood. And we say,
[43:27] "Well, of course we know what that was.
[43:28] He was a prefigure of Christ. It was,
[43:30] you know, this the type of Christ
[43:31] sacrificing." Listen, but no one told
[43:33] Abel that. Abel had no book to go back
[43:36] and read, right? But brother Brandham
[43:40] said, "But by revelation, God had
[43:42] revealed to him that the only sacrifice
[43:45] God was going to accept to atone for sin
[43:48] was blood. And it was going to be the
[43:50] life of an innocent substitute. It was
[43:53] going to be the only approach accepted
[43:55] by God. And can I say that approach has
[43:58] not changed. That sacrifice has not
[44:00] changed. And that the same what Abel
[44:02] accepted today is the only thing God
[44:05] will accept now. It is a not in a
[44:07] popular way. Not come on somebody. It is
[44:10] not the beautiful way. It's not the way
[44:13] that looks good and you know properly
[44:15] dressed and scientific and socially
[44:17] acceptable and everybody's you know got
[44:19] perfection and no you know you uh you
[44:21] know there no one has any defects if we
[44:24] can say you know the church is perfect
[44:26] the music is perfect the the choir is
[44:29] perfect the preacher is articulate he
[44:31] makes no mistakes and lives a perfect
[44:33] life he's got a big Joe Ostein smile
[44:36] everything looks like it's you know uh
[44:37] just perfect man the makeup all over and
[44:40] it's just perfect just looks Perfect. I
[44:42] tell you what that is. That was the way
[44:44] of Cain. Abel's way didn't look too
[44:46] good. It didn't even sound too good. All
[44:48] you could hear was the sound of a
[44:50] screaming lamb, a bleeding lamb as it
[44:52] was dying. But I tell you what, brother,
[44:54] it was the accepted way. And it's the
[44:57] only thing it is that is accepted today.
[45:00] Is the rejected way that is laughed at
[45:03] and scorned at, but it's God's way.
[45:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:08] &gt;&gt; This is what brother Brandon says here.
[45:09] I love this. My sermon title, I didn't
[45:11] give it to you, but I did give it to the
[45:12] back and I'm going to give it to you
[45:14] now. You said, "Brother Matt, what's
[45:15] your sermon?" It's so simple, yet so
[45:18] wonderful.
[45:19] What's your title? So simple,
[45:24] yet so wonderful.
[45:27] &gt;&gt; Well, good, brother Matt. I waiting for
[45:28] your title. That's my title.
[45:33] I love that. Don't you love simple
[45:35] things?
[45:36] As like begets like, the true church
[45:39] will always be the one that tries to
[45:42] follow in the steps of her founders at
[45:45] Pentecost.
[45:46] &gt;&gt; And her messengers will follow the
[45:48] Apostle Paul, the first messenger to the
[45:51] first church age. It is that simple and
[45:55] that wonderful. Amen.
[45:57] &gt;&gt; It's amazing to me because anytime that
[45:59] that that that uh you you can always see
[46:02] this and and I'm going to take more time
[46:04] to labor this point out or to more uh
[46:06] galvanize it in your mind, but it's so
[46:09] amazing because truly the the truest
[46:13] things are so simple to understand.
[46:17] &gt;&gt; Yet they are so wonderful.
[46:20] And I believe if we're not careful
[46:22] sometimes we lose the simplicity of
[46:25] things because maybe if it would be more
[46:28] complex that's how the human mind thinks
[46:31] then we think it's more profound but
[46:34] actually sometimes the most profound
[46:36] things are the most simple things
[46:40] &gt;&gt; with this key. Listen to what brother
[46:42] Brandham says here with this key. What
[46:45] key? So simple yet so wonderful. So
[46:48] that's a key. It's going to How many
[46:50] knows what a key will do? A key will
[46:52] unlock something.
[46:54] &gt;&gt; Now, if you don't have the key, you can
[46:56] jiggle the handle. You can beat on the
[46:57] door, but you'll never have access to
[46:59] it.
[47:00] &gt;&gt; But if you got the key, it'll unlock the
[47:02] door. With this key so simple yet so
[47:05] wonderful, I was able by the help of the
[47:08] Holy Spirit to read the book of
[47:09] Revelation and his and the histories and
[47:12] find therein each age, each messenger,
[47:15] the duration of the of each age, and the
[47:18] part each played in the purpose of God
[47:20] from Pentecost to the consummation of
[47:23] those ages. Stay with me here. I'm going
[47:25] to read this and I just believe it's so
[47:27] important. The key given to me of the
[47:30] Lord whereby I was able to determine the
[47:33] messenger for each age is a most
[47:36] scriptural one.
[47:38] &gt;&gt; In fact, it might be called the keystone
[47:43] of the Bible.
[47:46] &gt;&gt; Now, pause that if you could blank that
[47:47] screen for me for a moment. The
[47:50] keystone, think about that. In another
[47:52] place, the prophet of God says the head
[47:55] or like the keystone in an arch. He he
[47:57] uses that example and he talks about how
[48:00] that that arch comes all the way from
[48:02] left to right but in the middle is the
[48:04] keystone and he says notice what that
[48:06] keystone does. That keystone is holding
[48:09] the arch together. If you remove the
[48:12] keystone everything else falls apart.
[48:14] Right?
[48:15] &gt;&gt; So he says this was a keystone of the
[48:18] Bible. that you can you can see this
[48:21] pattern because what as we said that you
[48:24] could see this all the way back if you
[48:26] go in your minds here for a moment in
[48:28] fact if you go all the way back to the
[48:30] kings God was going to have a pattern
[48:33] very much like we're about to read here
[48:36] God was going to have a keystone in type
[48:38] throughout the whole scripture notice it
[48:40] wouldn't change listen to what brother
[48:42] Brandham says here he says the key
[48:44] whereby I was able to turn his messenger
[48:46] is the most scripture one in fact it
[48:47] could be called the keystone of the
[48:48] Bible
[48:49] It is the revelation that God never
[48:53] changes
[48:56] &gt;&gt; and that his ways are as unchangeable as
[49:00] he is. Hebrews 13:8 says Jesus Christ
[49:02] the same yesterday and today and
[49:05] forever. What God did in the first
[49:09] church age is what he wants to do in all
[49:14] other ages. Amen.
[49:18] &gt;&gt; So, let's go back to Sunday school. What
[49:20] is the first church age? Is it Kings,
[49:22] Moses, Abraham? Where are you at,
[49:24] brother Matt? No.
[49:26] The first church age being that Ephesian
[49:29] age that we just read about in the book
[49:30] of Acts.
[49:32] &gt;&gt; So, he says what God did in the first
[49:35] church age is what he wants to do in all
[49:39] other ages. Let's go further. The word
[49:41] can't change or be changed because the
[49:44] word is God.
[49:46] &gt;&gt; In the beginning was the word and the
[49:47] word was with God and the word was God.
[49:49] To change one word of it is Eve did
[49:51] bring sin and death even as it says in
[49:54] Revelations 22:18 and 19. If any man
[49:56] shall add unto these things, God shall
[49:57] add unto him the plagues that are
[49:59] written in this book. And if any man
[50:00] shall take away from the words of this
[50:02] book of this prophecy, God shall take
[50:04] away his part out of the book of life
[50:07] and out of the holy city and from the
[50:09] things which are written in this book.
[50:12] Thus, what the church was at Pentecost
[50:18] &gt;&gt; is the standard.
[50:22] &gt;&gt; Now, there we go. There's that word
[50:24] standard. what the church was at
[50:27] Pentecost is the standard. Oh, hold on a
[50:30] minute. Hold on, brother Matt. Hold on
[50:32] just a minute. You mean that we're not
[50:33] the standard? You mean that the bride
[50:35] and you know, Lady Aia, here we are.
[50:37] We're not the standard. Oh, hold on. You
[50:39] mean that the mega churches and, you
[50:41] know, and the the ones that fills
[50:42] thousands and arenas of thousands of
[50:44] people, that's not the standard? You
[50:46] mean the Catholic Church, millions upon
[50:48] millions strong, that's not the
[50:50] standard? No. God was going to have one
[50:53] standard that he would judge everything
[50:56] else by.
[50:57] &gt;&gt; And the prophet points all the way back
[50:59] to the book of Acts in Acts two.
[51:03] &gt;&gt; And says what the church was at
[51:06] Pentecost is the keystone. It's the
[51:09] standard.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; Notice that is the pattern.
[51:15] There is no other pattern.
[51:21] No matter what the scholars say, God has
[51:24] not changed that pattern.
[51:27] &gt;&gt; What God did at Pentecost, he has to
[51:31] keep on doing until the church ages
[51:34] close.
[51:35] &gt;&gt; And as a man tried to tell me, "Well,
[51:37] brother Matt, there you go. We're out of
[51:38] the ages. There's your key. You just
[51:40] lost all the validity, all the smoke out
[51:42] of your all the thunder out of your
[51:43] quotes gone." Because he said, "Until
[51:45] the church ages close." And the church
[51:46] ages are closed. Well, hold on just for
[51:49] a minute before you go so far uh that
[51:51] that that you just lose me alto
[51:53] together.
[51:54] &gt;&gt; If the church ages are over, then that
[51:57] means one thing. The gentile
[51:59] dispensation is over.
[52:01] &gt;&gt; I don't care what quote you want to add
[52:04] or disjoint or add here or make Brother
[52:05] Brandon say something here. Here's what
[52:08] the prophet of God tells us. Here's a
[52:10] direct statement. Thus, the fullness of
[52:13] the seven church ages are the fullness
[52:16] of the gentile church.
[52:20] &gt;&gt; And so, let me just tell you, whether
[52:22] you want to be or not, you are still in
[52:24] the church ages.
[52:26] &gt;&gt; Now, I know Revelations chapter 4, I
[52:29] know that we were, you know, that we've
[52:30] been translated out of the kingdom of
[52:32] darkness into the kingdom of his dear
[52:34] son. I know that my soul has received a
[52:36] positional change, and I'm no longer of
[52:38] the world, but I'm still in the world,
[52:40] brother.
[52:41] I I I know that I know that this is a
[52:43] bride age, meaning the bride time,
[52:45] meeting the token time, an eagle time,
[52:47] fourth light, fourth messenger. Listen
[52:49] friends, I know all of those things. But
[52:51] here's one thing you cannot get away
[52:53] from. You are still here. How many still
[52:55] here? You are still facing demons. How
[52:58] many still facing demons? So, you mean
[53:00] you're not in the millennium yet? You're
[53:02] not in heaven. You're not angels. I'm
[53:03] not preaching to theophanes. I'm
[53:05] preaching to real people who face real
[53:07] problems, who the devil talks to and God
[53:10] talks to.
[53:11] &gt;&gt; I'm preaching to people who are still
[53:12] struggling.
[53:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[53:16] &gt;&gt; So somehow there's a part of us that is
[53:18] still here in this gentile church age.
[53:23] &gt;&gt; So the pattern of Pentecost he has to
[53:25] keep on doing until the church ages
[53:27] close. Those scholars may tell you, yes
[53:30] they do, brother Brandham, how prophetic
[53:32] this was, that the apostolic age is
[53:36] over. I love the simple, simple answer.
[53:39] Don't you believe it?
[53:44] &gt;&gt; As long as men are being called and sent
[53:47] forth with the word of life, there's an
[53:49] apostolic age going on.
[53:53] Secondly, they refer to an age of
[53:56] manifested Holy Ghost power. I just
[53:58] heard a man who claims to be a message
[54:01] believer, a message preacher, preaches
[54:03] the message of Malachi 4 say almost the
[54:06] same exact statement that now that we
[54:08] have the fullness of the word, we no
[54:11] longer need the manifestation of the
[54:13] spirit.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; Now, friends, I'm going to tell you what
[54:18] it is. It's the it's it's exactly what
[54:20] the prophet of God warned us that out of
[54:22] every revival, it would produce twins.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; It did in Cain and Abel. It did in Jacob
[54:29] and Esau. It did in Jesus and Judas. You
[54:32] can go all the way throughout every
[54:34] revival. There would be a church natural
[54:36] and there would be a church spiritual.
[54:38] There would be an Israel natural and an
[54:40] Israel. Not all Israel is Israel. How
[54:43] many knows that
[54:44] &gt;&gt; that not all Jews are true Jews? In
[54:46] fact, some of them are the synagogue of
[54:48] Satan. So, just the same exact way that
[54:51] there's a synagogue of Satan, a false
[54:53] Jew, and a true Jew, how much more there
[54:56] would be a true Gentile bride and a
[54:59] false gentile bride.
[55:03] &gt;&gt; That's what brother Brandham said. He
[55:04] said she's he's deceiving her. It's it's
[55:07] just like there's a true Eve, there's
[55:09] also a false Eve. Can you say amen? So
[55:11] the that that there that he says
[55:13] secondly they refer to an age of
[55:15] manifested Holy Ghost power as being
[55:18] over since the Bible has been completed.
[55:22] That is untrue.
[55:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:25] &gt;&gt; There's not even one scripture that
[55:27] suggests that. But many conclusively
[55:30] state otherwise.
[55:33] Are you here tonight? Yes. Amen.
[55:37] &gt;&gt; He says, "But conclusively state
[55:40] otherwise." Bear with me just for a
[55:42] moment. I just feel the Holy Spirit
[55:45] taking me in a certain direction, and
[55:46] I'm just I'm going to be obedient to
[55:48] him. Amen. I just want you to uh just
[55:52] give me a minute. You don't have to
[55:53] display this, but I um I want to um I
[55:58] want to just bring it up here just for a
[56:00] moment. Give me one moment here.
[56:03] I'm going to keep reading from that.
[56:05] Sister Sarah, if you can just keep that
[56:06] displayed,
[56:08] that'd be wonderful.
[56:12] Yes. But many, notice this. But many
[56:14] conclusively state otherwise. Let's keep
[56:17] going. The promise of power with which
[56:20] the apostles were endued at Pentecost is
[56:25] to you Jews, and to your children Jews,
[56:29] and to all them that are a far off.
[56:31] Amen. Amen.
[56:33] &gt;&gt; Gentiles. What does that word gentile
[56:35] mean? Nations. That just means everybody
[56:38] else.
[56:40] &gt;&gt; And to as many as the Lord our God shall
[56:43] call, both Jew and Gentile, until he
[56:46] stops calling, the Pentecostal message
[56:50] and power will not cease.
[56:56] What the church had at Pentecost, you
[56:59] want to know your right tonight? Is her
[57:01] inaliable right?
[57:03] &gt;&gt; Originally, she had the true word.
[57:05] Notice the pure word of God. She had the
[57:08] power of the spirit manifested in
[57:10] diverse signs and wonders and gifts of
[57:12] the Holy Ghost. That original church was
[57:15] not organized by men. It was led by the
[57:19] Holy Ghost.
[57:20] &gt;&gt; I'll say that again. in that original
[57:22] church was not organized by men. It
[57:24] wasn't this brother and this brother and
[57:25] those are the great kings of the, you
[57:27] know, the the the elected. Listen
[57:29] friends, there ain't no kings amongst
[57:31] us. There's one king. His name is Jesus.
[57:33] There's no great man amongst us. There's
[57:35] one great man I it's not a brother in
[57:38] Africa. It's not a brother in New
[57:39] Zealand. It's not a brother somewhere.
[57:41] Listen, it's not even brother Brandham.
[57:43] That is not the great man who's amongst
[57:45] us. It is the Lord Jesus Christ. He
[57:48] himself, the word, the headstone coming
[57:51] back to the body. That is the king of
[57:53] kings that I worship.
[57:57] &gt;&gt; And he says it was not organized by men.
[57:59] It was led by the Holy Ghost. It wasn't
[58:02] very big. It was hated and despised. It
[58:04] was oppressed. It was persecuted unto
[58:06] death. But it was true to God. It stayed
[58:10] with the original word pattern. Amen.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; The true church will always try to be
[58:17] like the original at Pentecost.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:22] &gt;&gt; Let's read that again. The true church
[58:25] will always try to be No, hold on a
[58:28] minute, brother Matt. We're to separate
[58:29] from that because that was the
[58:31] Pentecostal age and that was Daddy
[58:33] Seymour and and the Isuza revival. This
[58:36] isn't what Brother Brandham's talking
[58:37] about at all.
[58:38] &gt;&gt; That was a false impersonation. And
[58:41] brother Brandham says, "But it looks so
[58:43] much like the real."
[58:46] &gt;&gt; This is what brother Brandham said. He
[58:47] said that shuck looks so much like the
[58:49] true grain.
[58:52] &gt;&gt; And he said that it it would be so close
[58:54] it almost looked like the real What's he
[58:57] speaking of? The Isuza revival
[59:00] &gt;&gt; where where a little dingy hall on the
[59:02] corner of somewhere no one even was
[59:04] paying attention to wasn't in some kind
[59:05] of great city center. It wasn't down in
[59:07] the middle of Los Angeles. wasn't down
[59:09] in the middle of some great big, you
[59:10] know, uh uh uh neighborhood and some
[59:13] great big renowned church. Do you
[59:14] realize that the Isuza revival was in
[59:17] just a little corner on a side street in
[59:19] a little dingy building,
[59:22] &gt;&gt; but there were a few people who were in
[59:24] one mind and one accord.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Matt, what are you
[59:27] what are you saying?" That was a true
[59:29] work of the Holy Spirit. That was the
[59:30] restoration part of the restoration of
[59:32] gifts, which was the restoration of the
[59:34] bride tree. But the prophet of God said
[59:36] it was just the shuck.
[59:38] that pulled away out it pulled out of
[59:41] brother Brandham's it pulled out of they
[59:44] walked away from brother Brandham's
[59:45] message they walked away they if you
[59:47] think about this friends when he came to
[59:50] his true ministry as long as he was
[59:52] healing the sick as long as the they
[59:54] were raising the dead as long as blind
[59:55] eyes were seeing and listen it
[59:57] completely when when the message of the
[59:59] hour when God truly came to a prophet I
[1:00:02] I was just reading this today I thought
[1:00:04] it was so so good this is not even a
[1:00:06] message believer who writes this This is
[1:00:08] an assembly uh Pentecostal man who wrote
[1:00:10] this study in the life of of William
[1:00:12] Brandham. Has no no connection to the
[1:00:14] message whatsoever. He's a he's a
[1:00:16] actually a historian. If you find his
[1:00:18] website, William Brandham shocked the
[1:00:20] world by ripping the thin veil between
[1:00:23] science and the supernatural. His
[1:00:26] ministry did not just bless. In many
[1:00:28] instances, it terrified.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; In Los Angeles, a man with cancer stood
[1:00:33] in the healing line for hours. While
[1:00:36] waiting, he witnessed every kind of
[1:00:37] healing imaginable. However, when it was
[1:00:40] his turn for prayer, the evangelist
[1:00:42] refused. And dignant, the man demanded
[1:00:45] to know why. Brandham said, "You don't
[1:00:48] want me to tell you." The man was now
[1:00:50] furious and refused to leave without an
[1:00:53] answer. So, you know what brother
[1:00:54] Brandham did? He gave him an answer.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; You're sleeping with your secretary.
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; With that, the man dropped his head and
[1:01:03] rushed out of the meeting.
[1:01:05] William Brandham was an answer to
[1:01:08] desperate prayer and an act of love by
[1:01:11] God the Father.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; The Pentecostal movement was dying
[1:01:15] because of infighting and immorality.
[1:01:18] Wow.
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; The death of a revival. Boy, don't we
[1:01:21] see the same spirit today?
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody.
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; The Pentecostal, let me read that again.
[1:01:27] Movement was dying because of
[1:01:28] infighting. It was not what comes
[1:01:30] externally. It's what happens internally
[1:01:31] that destroys families. It's not what
[1:01:34] happens outside. It's what starts to
[1:01:36] take place undercover on the inside that
[1:01:38] blows up homes, blows up churches, blows
[1:01:41] up relationships.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; Keep going, brother Matt. Okay, I will.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; Divine healing had fallen into
[1:01:51] disrepute. Meetings were often fraught
[1:01:54] with emotionalism. Charlatans whipped
[1:01:57] audiences into frenzies. Most healing
[1:01:59] testimonies were sketchy at best. Things
[1:02:02] were also bad outside the church.
[1:02:04] America was in the grip of a fear of a
[1:02:06] nuclear war. Psychiatry was replacing
[1:02:09] faith.
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; My, doesn't it sound just like 2025?
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; A whole generation was racing away from
[1:02:18] God. Preachers were at a loss about what
[1:02:21] to do about it. Today, the spiritfilled
[1:02:24] movement finds itself in the same
[1:02:25] predicament. Once again, we are mired by
[1:02:29] division and emotionalism. Amen.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; Only this time, it's much, much worse.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; 1946,
[1:02:38] enter William Brham.
[1:02:41] The atmosphere is low-key. There's no
[1:02:44] attempt to manipulate the people.
[1:02:47] Brandham tells the audience, "When the
[1:02:49] angel of the Lord is present," a
[1:02:52] statement that should sound preposterous
[1:02:54] except that astounding things start
[1:02:57] happening. Amen.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; Or Roberts once told me there were no
[1:03:02] hard cases for Brandham while he was
[1:03:04] enveloped by the anointing. Growths
[1:03:06] vanished, lifeless limbs awakened, blind
[1:03:09] eyes open. American historian David
[1:03:12] Edwin Herald Jr. described Brandham as
[1:03:14] an unlikely leader. His preaching was
[1:03:16] halting and simple beyond belief. But
[1:03:18] William Brandham became a prophet to a
[1:03:21] generation. A small, meek, middle-aged
[1:03:23] man with piercing eyes. He held
[1:03:26] audiences spellbound with tales of
[1:03:28] constant communication with God and
[1:03:29] angels. Night after night before
[1:03:31] thousands of all believers, he discerned
[1:03:33] the diseases of the sick and pronounced
[1:03:36] them healed. Like few men have ever been
[1:03:40] endowed with the raw supernatural power
[1:03:43] of William Brandham.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; There for the entire world to see, for
[1:03:47] medical science to test, were signs and
[1:03:49] wonders that were incontrovertible.
[1:03:52] Brennham's innocence and simplicity
[1:03:54] would have been his demise had it not
[1:03:56] been for Gordon Lindseay. Listen to
[1:03:58] this. Harold said of Gordon Lindsay,
[1:03:59] "More than any other man, brought system
[1:04:01] and unity contributing
[1:04:03] an orderly mind." Listen to listen what
[1:04:06] what he goes on to say, and this is
[1:04:08] actually a testimony that Perry Green
[1:04:10] began to tell. It's pretty powerful. How
[1:04:12] that Perry Green goes to that meeting,
[1:04:14] never before meeting Brother Brandham,
[1:04:16] never knowing, just hearing of his
[1:04:17] meetings. And he walks into that
[1:04:19] building and and brother Green said I
[1:04:21] wanted to get up really close to the
[1:04:23] front. So I stood there just by the a he
[1:04:26] said just by the uh the the front row
[1:04:28] very skeptical.
[1:04:30] He said in my mind just a skeptic in my
[1:04:32] heart seeing what was taking place. He
[1:04:34] said I watched he said I watched case
[1:04:36] after case and he said as I as a case
[1:04:39] began to go through the prayer line he
[1:04:40] says I got a little bit closer till I
[1:04:42] was right by the altar standing in a
[1:04:44] crowd of people that he didn't know. And
[1:04:46] he said, "I watched," he said, "I
[1:04:47] watched Brother Brandham take a little
[1:04:49] boy." And he said, "A daddy," he said,
[1:04:51] "a
[1:04:53] or mother, sorry, a mother that had
[1:04:55] brought a little boy uh up to the prayer
[1:04:57] line." And he said, "And I watched that
[1:04:59] mother take that little boy and give him
[1:05:01] to brother Brandham." And brother
[1:05:02] Brandham held the little boy in his arm,
[1:05:04] crippled from the day he was born. Knees
[1:05:06] had never worked, couldn't walk,
[1:05:07] completely a And the woman
[1:05:09] tells Brother Green says, she tells of
[1:05:11] this and tells Brother Brandham what the
[1:05:13] need is. And and he says, "I'll never
[1:05:15] forget." he says is brother Brandham
[1:05:16] just takes that boy and just buries his
[1:05:18] head in his jacket and he begins to talk
[1:05:21] and say, "Lord, if you were here today,
[1:05:23] how much you would sympathize for a
[1:05:25] little boy like this born in this
[1:05:27] condition and and Brother Green begins
[1:05:29] to try to relate Brother Brandham's
[1:05:30] prayer there as Brother Brandham takes
[1:05:32] and he prays and he said, "I watched."
[1:05:34] Brother Green said, "Everybody else was
[1:05:35] praying with their eyes closed." He
[1:05:36] said, "I'll be honest. I was squinting
[1:05:38] my right eye looking and watching,
[1:05:40] seeing what was going to take place."
[1:05:42] And he says, 'I watched as that one
[1:05:43] right leg kicked out like this as
[1:05:45] brother Brandham was praying. And then
[1:05:46] the left leg started wiggling like this.
[1:05:48] Legs that had not been moved before,
[1:05:50] completely lame. And he says, "I watched
[1:05:53] as it looked like brother Brandham
[1:05:54] dropped the little boy, grabbed him
[1:05:56] again, and he said then said in Jesus
[1:05:58] name, amen." He said, "I watched that
[1:06:00] little boy drop to the platform, stand
[1:06:02] on his feet, and come running at me."
[1:06:06] And he said, "And leaped off of the
[1:06:09] stage onto a man's arms." Little did I
[1:06:12] know that was his daddy standing right
[1:06:14] beside me.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; Now, I tell you what this was, friends.
[1:06:20] This was this was God restoring as they
[1:06:23] looked at his his healing revival and
[1:06:26] could accept that kind of ministry, but
[1:06:28] walked away from him when he began to
[1:06:30] come to his real ministry, which was not
[1:06:32] the healing revival. Listen, I'm
[1:06:34] thankful for miracles. I believe God can
[1:06:36] still do them today. But it is not the
[1:06:39] miracle. It is not the the fanatical. It
[1:06:42] is not the super uh the super
[1:06:44] sensational that that locks my heart to
[1:06:47] this message. It is that Christ, the
[1:06:49] word has identified my name in the
[1:06:52] backside of this book and said, "You're
[1:06:55] part of this thing. You're not just a,
[1:06:57] you know, born in another age and
[1:06:58] another time, but I've called you in
[1:07:00] this age to to to stand for Jesus
[1:07:03] Christ.
[1:07:05] that I heard my name called through that
[1:07:08] message.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; And it was God restoring that original
[1:07:14] faith, that original word pattern.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now you see why I why uh you know
[1:07:21] as a as as a you know just very recently
[1:07:23] just a just just here recently just a
[1:07:26] few months ago a brother
[1:07:29] I'm going to be careful how I say this
[1:07:31] but has started you know to tell me
[1:07:33] about this approach that you know he he
[1:07:35] doesn't you know he he's he's he's sort
[1:07:37] of lean listen friends if you want to
[1:07:40] lend your ear to trash there's enough
[1:07:42] trash out there
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; if you want to lend your if you want to
[1:07:45] take your time and spend your time
[1:07:47] reading and watching and veging and
[1:07:49] entertaining yourself. I tell you what,
[1:07:51] there's enough skepticism to make you
[1:07:53] walk away from this church, to walk away
[1:07:56] from this Bible, to walk away from
[1:07:58] everything you were ever born to believe
[1:08:00] or told from the time you were a little
[1:08:02] boy. There's enough out there to make
[1:08:04] you believe the Holocaust never
[1:08:06] happened.
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; Yet, I was there myself in Ashawitz two
[1:08:09] times now and seen for myself and heard
[1:08:12] from personal eyewitnesses. But yet
[1:08:14] there's enough skepticism out there to
[1:08:16] where people literally take a delusional
[1:08:19] spirit to say that the Holocaust never
[1:08:21] happened. It was made up.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; There's enough trash out there to get
[1:08:26] you to believe that.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; There's enough trash if you want to feed
[1:08:28] upon it to tell you that the earth is
[1:08:30] flat, that we never went to the moon.
[1:08:32] You say, "Brother man, you're saying,
[1:08:34] "Oh, I don't." Listen, friends, I'm just
[1:08:35] going to tell you right now, there's
[1:08:37] enough garbage on the internet to make
[1:08:39] you believe anything.
[1:08:41] It's making people men believe they're
[1:08:43] women. Women believe that they're men.
[1:08:45] Even some kids believe in their cats and
[1:08:47] dogs.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; What is it? It's a delusional spirit
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; to get us to stray from the original
[1:08:55] word pattern.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; I'm preaching to you. My message is it's
[1:09:00] simple. So simple yet so wonderful.
[1:09:03] Because I find that what we have when we
[1:09:05] run out of sometimes people got to be
[1:09:07] preaching feeling that they got to
[1:09:08] something new and something great and
[1:09:10] something you know something that blow
[1:09:12] people's minds. Can I just say here
[1:09:13] tonight I've had sermons that I thought
[1:09:15] were going to just be awesome. I had
[1:09:17] studied waited on God lined up this
[1:09:19] quote with this quote. Oh man, it just
[1:09:21] looked so you know ethereal and I could
[1:09:23] almost put it on a chalkboard. I felt
[1:09:25] like a spiritual Albert Einstein. It was
[1:09:27] not those sermons that ever changed
[1:09:29] anyone's life. It was in fact the most
[1:09:32] simple sermons where I testified of how
[1:09:35] I went through a dark time and a dark
[1:09:37] place and God delivered me and I could
[1:09:40] say, "Brother, if he brought me through
[1:09:42] it, he's faithful to bring you through
[1:09:44] it."
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; It has been the simple things that have
[1:09:47] changed people's lives.
[1:09:52] And that brother started telling me, you
[1:09:54] know, are we maybe we're quoting brother
[1:09:55] Brandham too, you know, saying brother
[1:09:56] Brandham too much and we got to say, you
[1:09:59] know, you know, brother Brandham said,
[1:10:00] why can't you know, he had a very
[1:10:02] logical reason for thinking this? And I
[1:10:04] thought, brother, hold on a minute.
[1:10:06] Jesus quoted prophets.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; John quoted prophets.
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; In fact, it was John who said, I they
[1:10:13] said, who are you? I'm exactly who
[1:10:15] Isaiah said I was.
[1:10:18] It was Paul who quoted prophets. I was
[1:10:20] standing in a meeting in Honduras last
[1:10:22] year. I think it was JD. Last year to
[1:10:24] get my year wrong. Last year. Last year
[1:10:27] me and brother Jason were down in
[1:10:28] Honduras in some special meetings. I
[1:10:30] preached at several churches. I would go
[1:10:33] one way. They send us not two by two,
[1:10:35] one by one. They split us up. Not much
[1:10:37] to our chagrin. They'd send JD to one
[1:10:39] and me to another. And I didn't know
[1:10:41] where I was going, where I was
[1:10:42] preaching. Didn't know anything about
[1:10:43] the people. Love the pastor I was there
[1:10:44] with. And and then the brother took me.
[1:10:47] He said, "Brother Matt, tonight, you
[1:10:48] know, to to be ready, I got to go to
[1:10:50] I'm" He's a school teacher. He said,
[1:10:51] "Tonight I'm going to go and and uh take
[1:10:53] you to a church in Tusiagi Galpa." And
[1:10:55] uh forgive me, I probably shouldn't have
[1:10:57] said that, but uh he told me where we
[1:10:59] were going and he said he said I said,
[1:11:01] "Okay, brother." Just like he did every
[1:11:02] other night. Didn't know the people,
[1:11:04] didn't know love the people, precious
[1:11:06] people. And every night felt like the
[1:11:07] Lord would just give me something
[1:11:09] different, something inspired, you know,
[1:11:10] for the people. And it just, man, just
[1:11:12] was the Lord faithful. God's faithful to
[1:11:14] his own word.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; And I and I remember I went there and
[1:11:18] and I went to this church and I was
[1:11:19] struggling this this time to what would
[1:11:21] I preach? What am I going to preach on?
[1:11:23] And I and I just was praying, waiting on
[1:11:25] the Lord. And he had left me at the
[1:11:27] house all day cuz he was ah school
[1:11:29] teacher. Went that morning early. He's a
[1:11:30] pastor but also a teacher works during
[1:11:32] the day. He picked me up that afternoon
[1:11:33] and he he said, "Brother Matt, we're
[1:11:35] going to leave at this time." I said,
[1:11:36] "Just be ready." I said, "Okay." And I
[1:11:37] was, man, I was struggling between three
[1:11:38] or four different directions. Just
[1:11:39] didn't know what to preach. I wanted to
[1:11:41] preach something that was beneficial to
[1:11:42] the people. And and so I go there and
[1:11:45] and I I I get to the uh you know, he
[1:11:47] picks me up in the car and uh and he and
[1:11:50] we get maybe an hour, multiple hours,
[1:11:52] forget how many hours it was down the
[1:11:53] road. He said, "Brother Matt, you know
[1:11:54] what you're going to preach tonight?" I
[1:11:56] said, "Brother Eric," I said, "I I I
[1:11:58] don't yet. I'm still just waiting on the
[1:12:00] Lord, praying what I'm going to preach."
[1:12:02] He said, "Okay, brother Matt, no
[1:12:03] problem." We just keep driving. About 30
[1:12:05] minutes later, Brother Matt, you know
[1:12:06] what you're preaching? I said, "No,
[1:12:08] brother." I said, "I still don't know.
[1:12:10] you know, I'm just waiting on the Lord.
[1:12:11] I got a few things on my heart and you
[1:12:13] know, 10, 15 minutes later, finally the
[1:12:15] Lord just struck something and I just
[1:12:17] said it out loud. I said, "That's it."
[1:12:18] And he said, "You know," I said, "I do."
[1:12:20] He said, "What do you what's your
[1:12:21] title?" And I and the Lord took me back
[1:12:23] to his sermon. I think I'd only preached
[1:12:25] it here in one other place year, two
[1:12:28] years before. And and the Lord had taken
[1:12:30] me I preached a message and I titled it,
[1:12:32] "The truth shall make you free." Yeah.
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; And and he said and he I said, "That's
[1:12:39] the title. The truth shall make you
[1:12:40] free." And he just as as as just solemn
[1:12:43] as he could driving the car, he quotes
[1:12:45] my two scriptures.
[1:12:47] And I said, he said, "John 6." I said,
[1:12:49] "Yeah, that's right." He said, "Okay,
[1:12:52] good." I thought, "Boy, that's weird."
[1:12:54] He knew he knew my opening scriptures.
[1:12:56] Just what's going on here? And so we get
[1:13:00] there to that church and there's several
[1:13:01] hundred believers there and I meet the,
[1:13:02] you know, just very quickly they're
[1:13:04] singing already. I walk into the back
[1:13:05] and I get up there and man, I tell you
[1:13:07] what, I preached through a lot of
[1:13:08] translators. I've preached by with a lot
[1:13:10] of brothers. I have never to this day
[1:13:12] experienced anything like that. I
[1:13:14] usually when you're preaching, you're
[1:13:15] here and the translators here. After
[1:13:17] about 15 minutes into my sermon, I felt
[1:13:18] like I was the translator and he was the
[1:13:20] preacher
[1:13:22] cuz he was more passionate than I was.
[1:13:24] And he knew what I was going to say
[1:13:25] before I said it. I thought, my
[1:13:27] goodness, I mean, he's just is he am I
[1:13:28] translating him or is he translating me?
[1:13:30] And in that sermon, I use an example of
[1:13:32] how that Jo, you remember this example,
[1:13:34] how that when Joshua was going to cross
[1:13:36] into Jordan, cross the Jordan, how that
[1:13:38] the Bible says that God told Joshua to
[1:13:41] take 12 men out of each tribe, a man.
[1:13:44] And and he said, "Take these men." And
[1:13:46] he said, "And have them put their foot
[1:13:48] in the Jordan. And when you put your
[1:13:49] foot into the Jordan, the Jordan River
[1:13:51] will part." And and you notice they had
[1:13:53] to put action of their faith. And what
[1:13:55] was Jordan? A type of sin, right? It was
[1:13:58] a type of the world, right? death.
[1:14:00] Hello.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; And and brother Brandham, I begin to use
[1:14:04] that example and show how that that when
[1:14:06] they these priests. So notice what they
[1:14:08] were representing. They were holding
[1:14:10] back Jordan. And so I to use that I
[1:14:12] always do this wherever I preach that. I
[1:14:14] called up four men. I think it was four
[1:14:16] or six men out of the audience. And I
[1:14:19] just pointed I said, "You, brother, come
[1:14:20] here." And uh and you brother, it's a
[1:14:22] big old church. I said, "You come here."
[1:14:24] I'm just trying trying to, you know,
[1:14:25] just point people out. And a man sitting
[1:14:27] in the way very very very back. He's
[1:14:29] this big old guy. And I said, "You, he's
[1:14:31] me." I said, "You come here. Come here.
[1:14:33] Come running." So he comes running and I
[1:14:35] have all these men and I have them
[1:14:36] facing one, you know, one man here and
[1:14:39] one man here and and and they're facing
[1:14:41] each other. I said, "Now I want you to
[1:14:43] notice the people were going to cross in
[1:14:45] between the ministry." And so notice
[1:14:47] what was going to hold Jordan out of the
[1:14:49] people's lives. It was going to be a
[1:14:51] priest standing with his foot in the
[1:14:53] Jordan. Not compromising, not a wishw
[1:14:56] not a jellyfish, but he was he stood
[1:14:58] firm. Joshua said, "Have him stand
[1:15:00] firm." And notice after that, he says,
[1:15:02] "He take the stones uh uh where the
[1:15:04] priest feet stood and make a memorial."
[1:15:06] You know that when the children asked
[1:15:07] their fathers, "What meanest you by
[1:15:09] these stones?" And so notice I I have
[1:15:11] these men standing here and I said,
[1:15:12] "Notice it's their ministry, their stand
[1:15:15] that is holding Jordan sin." I said,
[1:15:17] "What would happen? What would happen if
[1:15:20] these men started saying, "We don't need
[1:15:22] to quote brother Brandham anymore. That
[1:15:24] was just Brother Brandham's opinion.
[1:15:26] Aren't we going to move on?" And you
[1:15:27] know, some say you're Paul, others of
[1:15:29] Paul. Aren't you our carnal? I said,
[1:15:30] "Notice this is what if these men
[1:15:32] started dumbing it down and hybriding it
[1:15:34] with their own ideas and you know, it's
[1:15:36] not so important. I got to say prophet,
[1:15:38] prophet, prophet." And when I started
[1:15:40] saying that, those I said, "You know
[1:15:41] what would happen if they started doing
[1:15:43] that? Jordan would start overflowing our
[1:15:46] churches. sin would start overflowing
[1:15:49] our young people.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; It would change the identity because we
[1:15:53] leave the original pattern.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; And that church went to a volcano. Man,
[1:15:58] I didn't know what was happening, but it
[1:16:00] erupted.
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; I got outside of there to the car, shook
[1:16:03] the brother's hands, got up to the car.
[1:16:05] When I got in the car, the pastor was
[1:16:07] the the pastor's wife just started
[1:16:09] balling. And he said, "Yeah, you tell
[1:16:10] him." He said, "Brother Matt, I wasn't
[1:16:12] going to tell you this. I determined in
[1:16:13] my heart not to say a word to you." He
[1:16:16] said, "Brother Matt," he said, "tive
[1:16:18] 5:00 this morning, I woke up to go to
[1:16:20] school and I prayed and said, 'Lord,
[1:16:22] give me the sermon that I that I should
[1:16:24] listen to. I'm going to go to Bethl's
[1:16:25] website. I'm going to get a sermon from
[1:16:26] Brother Matt and you give me the sermon
[1:16:28] I should hear to practice to hear his
[1:16:30] voice so I could do a good job
[1:16:31] interpreting." He said, "Brother Matt, I
[1:16:33] scrolled two or three pages deep and
[1:16:35] your archives." I randomly clicked on
[1:16:36] one sermon. Guess what?
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; It was that sermon you preached tonight.
[1:16:44] And he said, "And brother Matt, I didn't
[1:16:46] want to tell you anything." He said,
[1:16:47] "There are six men in this church who
[1:16:49] have started trying to slowly draw the
[1:16:52] people out of the message." And he said,
[1:16:54] "Those men just Wednesday, just a week
[1:16:56] before started preaching things that we
[1:16:58] don't need to quote brother Brandon. We
[1:16:59] still believe the message, but we don't
[1:17:01] need to say, "Brother Brandon, we don't
[1:17:02] need to quote brother Brandon. People
[1:17:03] think we're weird and people think we're
[1:17:05] odd." And he said, "Brother Matt,
[1:17:06] wouldn't you know it how the Lord did
[1:17:08] things?" He said, "There's six men, and
[1:17:10] you randomly picked all six of them and
[1:17:13] put them in the line and pointed to them
[1:17:15] and said, "What would happen if these
[1:17:17] brothers started saying, "We should, oh,
[1:17:19] you ought to give God praise." Listen,
[1:17:21] friends, this is not my word. It is not
[1:17:23] the words of a of a man from Kentucky.
[1:17:26] It is the word from the throne.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; And he protects his own gospel.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:37] It was the original word pattern. The
[1:17:40] word pattern, listen as brother Brandham
[1:17:42] says this. He says, "The true church,
[1:17:44] notice, will always try to be like the
[1:17:47] first one,
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; the original one at Pentecost. The true
[1:17:51] church of today will try to
[1:17:52] approximate," that means to try to be
[1:17:54] exactly like the early first one. And
[1:17:56] the messengers to the churches having
[1:17:58] the same spirit of God in them will try
[1:18:01] to approximate the apostle Paul. So this
[1:18:04] is the this is exactly what we have
[1:18:06] today. It was that original word
[1:18:09] pattern. Can I got 13 minutes, Siri
[1:18:11] says? So will you give it to me?
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; I'm not I may not take it all. Um we'll
[1:18:18] see.
[1:18:20] But this is so amazing. I'm just going
[1:18:21] to slow down here for a minute because I
[1:18:24] just feel, as I said at the beginning, I
[1:18:26] want to be faithful to what the Lord
[1:18:28] gave me. Amen.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; It's amazing because he shows this that
[1:18:33] this was the original word pattern that
[1:18:36] what God was going to do at Pentecost,
[1:18:40] not Isuza, not AD, not AD uh be, you
[1:18:44] know, uh 1906, but AD.33 what he was
[1:18:47] going to do in that first church.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; And he was going to set forth. Do you
[1:18:51] know that it's the same exact type you
[1:18:53] find in David? If you go read the book
[1:18:56] of Kings, first and second Kings, you
[1:18:58] know this very well that there were men
[1:19:00] that the writer of kings would write and
[1:19:02] he would say this king lived and his
[1:19:05] name was this and he was 13 years old or
[1:19:08] 15 years old and begin to reign. His
[1:19:09] mother's name was Beersa Zibian and and
[1:19:12] then it would always list it would say
[1:19:13] and he did that which was right in the
[1:19:16] sight of the Lord or it would say he did
[1:19:18] that which was evil in the sight of the
[1:19:21] Lord. And then if you ever watch there
[1:19:23] will always say he did that and not
[1:19:26] notice it would say this. He did he
[1:19:28] walked in all the ways wherein his
[1:19:31] father Jehodia was one example Jehovia
[1:19:35] had instructed him. How be it he never
[1:19:38] removed the high place.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; You skip two one chapter over and it
[1:19:42] says in the third year of Pica son of
[1:19:43] Rimaliah began Azariah to reign 33 years
[1:19:46] old was his mother's name was this and
[1:19:48] he did that which was right. It was a
[1:19:50] good king in the sight of the Lord. He
[1:19:52] did according to all that his father
[1:19:55] Usuza had done before him or whatever
[1:19:57] the man's name was. So he would always
[1:19:59] link him to his earthly father. But then
[1:20:02] it would say, "Yet not like David,
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; his father."
[1:20:11] Hold on a minute. You go read your Bible
[1:20:12] and you say, "Wait a minute." Okay, type
[1:20:14] this in. And who was Pico, Summeralia,
[1:20:17] Aariah? Was David his father? No.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; Well, why does it say yet not like his
[1:20:23] father David?
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; Because you have two fathers.
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; You have your earthly lineage of who you
[1:20:31] were born under and your last name. But
[1:20:34] then you have the word father.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; He has sent forth the spirit of his son
[1:20:40] whereby we cry aba.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; That means father. So in other words,
[1:20:46] David, this is so powerful. It wasn't
[1:20:48] just that that man, it was good that he
[1:20:50] could walk in all the ways of his own
[1:20:52] earthly father. And a lot of people walk
[1:20:54] as good as their daddy did. If their
[1:20:56] daddy was evil, they'll they'll be bound
[1:20:58] by the same problems that their dad did,
[1:21:00] the same tendencies that their dad had.
[1:21:02] If their dad was a hightempered man,
[1:21:04] most likely that child would receive
[1:21:06] that same trait and be hightempered. If
[1:21:08] their daddy was a liar, the son would
[1:21:10] probably be a liar. If the daddy was an
[1:21:11] honest businessman, most likely he'd be
[1:21:13] an honest businessman. If the daddy
[1:21:15] would, you know, it would always take
[1:21:17] the traits of their earthly lineage and
[1:21:20] even so much so that if the dad was a
[1:21:22] good man, the writer of Kings would say
[1:21:24] he did that which was right in the sight
[1:21:26] of the Lord. But then it would always
[1:21:27] put this asterk and say, "How be it not
[1:21:30] like David his father." So there was a
[1:21:34] link between David that the not natural
[1:21:38] lineage and a link between their earthly
[1:21:41] lineage. Oh, can I tell you that David
[1:21:44] was the original pattern by which every
[1:21:47] king would be measured?
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; That God was going to set a standard in
[1:21:52] David that that would be the house of
[1:21:54] David that Judah that this that Jesus
[1:21:56] would even come through. Why? There was
[1:21:58] something in David though the other men
[1:22:00] were good. The other men they walked in
[1:22:03] the ways of yet David was the original
[1:22:06] word or kingdom
[1:22:08] pattern. He was the original standard
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; in so much that God would say he is a
[1:22:16] man like after my own heart.
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; But can I tell you something? David
[1:22:24] wasn't a perfect man.
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; Listen, Pentecost was not a perfect
[1:22:31] church.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; You go read the book, let me say book of
[1:22:33] Acts. The book of Acts church had a lot
[1:22:35] of mistakes. It had a lot of failures.
[1:22:37] There was a lot wrong. But they were the
[1:22:39] alpha pattern.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; Abraham had a lot of mistakes in his
[1:22:43] life, too.
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; We we we heard about it preached here
[1:22:46] just Sunday. Abraham had a lot of
[1:22:48] mistakes in his own life. You can go
[1:22:50] back and look at any of the heroes of
[1:22:52] the faith and you could build them up.
[1:22:54] But naturally in their life, they were
[1:22:56] not perfect. They lied. They cheated.
[1:22:58] They stole. In fact, you look at Jacob
[1:23:00] who the Bible says, "Jacob have I loved.
[1:23:02] Esau have I hated." Right? Amen.
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; And the Bible's Paul picks it up and
[1:23:07] says God made this choice before either
[1:23:09] was born and either committed right or
[1:23:11] wrong. And he says that the purpose of
[1:23:14] election might stand. Can I tell you
[1:23:17] something that might shock you? Esau was
[1:23:20] a better man than Jacob was.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; He was a good man. Jacob was not a good
[1:23:26] man. But I tell you what Jacob was. He
[1:23:28] was a God man. He was the man God chose
[1:23:31] and God elected. He said that's not
[1:23:33] fair. Take it up with your heavenly
[1:23:35] father.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; It's not about fair or unfair. He was of
[1:23:39] God. He was the It wasn't God was not
[1:23:41] even saying hated in the sense of I hate
[1:23:43] Esau. I despise him. That's not even
[1:23:45] what the word hate means. It just means
[1:23:48] I've not chosen him.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; I've chosen Jacob.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; And so David was going to be that
[1:23:56] original word pattern. And there was
[1:23:58] going to become a man named Hezekiah who
[1:24:00] the Bible links and says, and there's
[1:24:01] another man named Josiah who the Bible
[1:24:03] says he was this old. He when he began
[1:24:05] to reign, he reigned this many years and
[1:24:07] he did that which was right. Go read
[1:24:09] your Bible right after that. It says he
[1:24:11] did all that. He says he walked in all
[1:24:14] the ways of his father David.
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; What was he doing? In other words, he
[1:24:20] had a link not with his old, not with
[1:24:22] just his earthly len, you've got an
[1:24:24] earthly book that got that has a lot of
[1:24:27] things against you. Abraham had a lot of
[1:24:29] things against his life. Jacob had a lot
[1:24:31] of things against his life. But my Bible
[1:24:33] in the book of Hebrews when it records
[1:24:35] the life of Abraham, it said he
[1:24:37] staggered not at the promises of God.
[1:24:39] What was it? One of them seen from this
[1:24:42] side of the cross, but this side of the
[1:24:44] cross had a totally different story. Oh,
[1:24:46] this side of your story might say
[1:24:48] mistakes and failures and addictions.
[1:24:50] Oh, but the side of the blood says
[1:24:52] chasteed and spotless and sinless lamb
[1:24:56] of God.
[1:24:58] [Applause]
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; So notice he would have an earthly
[1:25:02] lineage as brother Brandham was heard
[1:25:04] that voice and he said I watched my
[1:25:06] life. He says I was there on the river
[1:25:08] bank and he says there and you could
[1:25:10] hear him tell a story. He says you know
[1:25:12] I was picked on. I was hated. I was
[1:25:13] despised as a little boy. I had no
[1:25:15] friends in school. Everyone thought I
[1:25:17] was a weirdo. And he said, "No one
[1:25:19] really loved me." I love how Brother
[1:25:20] Adam says this. He said, "I didn't
[1:25:21] really have nobody to love me until I
[1:25:23] met Jesus. I found somebody that really
[1:25:26] loved me." And the prophet of God says,
[1:25:29] "There is a little boy laying on the
[1:25:31] bank." He said, "In the summertime, I'd
[1:25:32] lay there." And he said, "In the winter
[1:25:34] time, I'd lay there. Mom and dad,
[1:25:36] alcoholics and drinking." And he says,
[1:25:38] "And I' I'd lay there on the top of a
[1:25:39] little roof with snow freezing just like
[1:25:41] that." This is a little eight-year-old
[1:25:42] boy. And he said laying there freezing
[1:25:45] and he said in the party going on till
[1:25:46] 1:2 in the morning waiting. I didn't
[1:25:48] want to go home and be around any of
[1:25:50] that. Laying there freezing. He said he
[1:25:52] went over by the bank and build him just
[1:25:53] a little fire right by the bank and just
[1:25:55] warming up against that fire. Snow begin
[1:25:57] to melt like that.
[1:26:00] And and brother Brandon said then he'd
[1:26:02] keep going in the summertime. He said I
[1:26:04] he said I sat there. He said and I was
[1:26:05] there summertime. He said, "I was just
[1:26:07] fishing down by that same pond." And he
[1:26:09] said, "I looked down below me and he
[1:26:11] said, "And there was just," he said, "A
[1:26:13] little flower that just sprung up, and
[1:26:15] brother Bham says, hey, how'd you get
[1:26:18] there?"
[1:26:19] He says, "Look, there's life right
[1:26:21] there. The beautiful little flower." And
[1:26:23] he says, "I begin to look at that flower
[1:26:25] and just admire it." And he said,
[1:26:26] "Suddenly, it caught I caught it." And
[1:26:29] he said, I said, "Hey, you shouldn't be
[1:26:31] here." He says, "It was winter time."
[1:26:35] And he said, 'It should have killed you.
[1:26:36] It should have snuffed out your life.
[1:26:38] That snow, that that temperature shoot,
[1:26:40] you should not be here. And he said, to
[1:26:42] make it worse, I built a fire over top
[1:26:44] of you. And he says, yet somehow in the
[1:26:47] midst of that little uh fire, mark where
[1:26:49] that fire was. He had a winter. He said,
[1:26:51] there was a little flower springing
[1:26:53] forth. And he said, I I did everything.
[1:26:55] Everything was against you. You
[1:26:56] shouldn't be here. And the prophet said,
[1:26:58] "I suddenly realized I was that little
[1:27:00] flower and Satan had put everything in
[1:27:02] my life to try to destroy me and snuff
[1:27:05] me out and kill me and take me out." He
[1:27:08] said, "It's only by the grace of God."
[1:27:10] Oh, listen friends. Satan might have
[1:27:11] thrown everything at you and tried to
[1:27:13] destroy you and get you to walk away,
[1:27:16] but you're here tonight in the building.
[1:27:18] By the grace of God,
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; the prophet said, "Suddenly, I heard a
[1:27:22] voice that said, you are not the son of
[1:27:25] Charles and Ela Brandham, but you've got
[1:27:27] an identity that goes back to the
[1:27:30] original word pattern."
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, stand to your feet with me. I'm out
[1:27:34] of time.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; You've got an identity, a connection.
[1:27:40] Amen. A connection that goes all the way
[1:27:44] back. Way before your natural life
[1:27:46] started here. Way before you ever
[1:27:49] breathed your first breath. Way before
[1:27:51] you ever had your first battle. Way
[1:27:54] before you ever had your first
[1:27:55] misunderstanding. Your first problem.
[1:27:58] Your first burden. Your first trial.
[1:28:00] Long before all of that ever started.
[1:28:02] You were in the back part of God's mind.
[1:28:05] And there was a representation of you.
[1:28:09] and you didn't put it there and your
[1:28:12] good works didn't put it there and your
[1:28:14] good track record didn't put it there.
[1:28:16] Listen friends, I I I'm here to tell you
[1:28:18] tonight that if it would have been up to
[1:28:20] my record, I wouldn't be here tonight.
[1:28:22] And you'd be honest today, you'd say,
[1:28:23] "If it was up to my record and what the
[1:28:26] you know, if my life was to be
[1:28:27] displayed, I wouldn't even want my
[1:28:29] thoughts from last week displayed to you
[1:28:31] here tonight. I wouldn't want them from
[1:28:32] today." How many would want them?
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; None of us would want that.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; Why? because we're there's nothing
[1:28:39] within our own self that has we
[1:28:42] shouldn't be here today
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; but God
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; who was rich in mercy
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; oh how many could say that of your life
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; but God I was I was going one way but
[1:28:59] God I should have been there but God but
[1:29:02] God stepped in and mercy rewrote my life
[1:29:05] and it's only by the grace of the Lord
[1:29:08] Jesus that I see what I see, that I
[1:29:10] understand what I understand, that I
[1:29:13] believe what I believe. I got a
[1:29:15] revelation a long time ago. I'm not
[1:29:17] holding on to him. Brother Brandham
[1:29:18] said, he's holding on to me.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; Oh, and if you got Jesus, you got more
[1:29:24] than enough. If you got him, you got
[1:29:26] peace. You got joy, you got true
[1:29:28] satisfaction.
[1:29:30] You may not have it all put together.
[1:29:32] Your life may feel like a mess today.
[1:29:35] Oh, but there's a truth that's so
[1:29:37] simple, yet it's so wonderful.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; Could you bow your heads with me here
[1:29:43] today if we just
[1:29:46] talk to the Lord here just for a moment?
[1:29:49] Jesus,
[1:29:51] Lord,
[1:29:53] I feel just like David maybe. Or he
[1:29:56] would just look at his own life and say,
[1:29:58] "What is man that thou art mindful of
[1:30:01] him?
[1:30:03] are the son of man that thou visitth
[1:30:05] him.
[1:30:07] Oh, if I ascend to the heavens, behold,
[1:30:10] you're there. If I go down to hell,
[1:30:12] behold, you're there.
[1:30:16] That's our life, Lord God. Doesn't
[1:30:18] matter if we're up, if we're down,
[1:30:20] you're there. If we're left, if we're
[1:30:22] right, you're there. If we're in, if
[1:30:25] we're out, you're still there. That's
[1:30:26] the only reason we find oursel here
[1:30:29] tonight.
[1:30:31] It's because there's a grace, an
[1:30:33] overwhelming grace in our life. Lord,
[1:30:36] I pray, God, as we've preached this
[1:30:38] sermon here today and made a mess, Lord,
[1:30:40] of it.
[1:30:43] I pray that you would take these things,
[1:30:46] Lord, that has been spoken.
[1:30:49] May they find their their place, Lord,
[1:30:53] in that good soil of the heart.
[1:30:57] said these things, Lord, as you inspired
[1:30:59] me to. And I just pray that your word
[1:31:02] would
[1:31:04] come now, Lord, and do what you only you
[1:31:06] can do. It doesn't matter that we hear
[1:31:08] the voice of men. Oh, but if we can just
[1:31:10] hear that voice of the Lord, and it's a
[1:31:14] still small voice, that still small
[1:31:16] voice that cuts through all the all of
[1:31:20] the earthquakes and the lightnings and
[1:31:22] the fires and the flashings.
[1:31:25] It was that voice, Lord God, that Elijah
[1:31:27] needed to hear. I pray you'd you'd let
[1:31:31] someone, Lord, maybe if their heart has
[1:31:34] grown deaf to that voice, may you open
[1:31:37] up their ears tonight, Lord.
[1:31:39] If it's me, Lord, then let me raise my
[1:31:41] hand and say, "Open up my ears, Lord,
[1:31:44] that I could hear your still small
[1:31:46] voice." Oh, I just raise my hand now and
[1:31:50] say, Lord, open up any channel in my
[1:31:52] life, Lord, that maybe has been blocked.
[1:31:56] Blocked by an idea, blocked by, Lord,
[1:31:59] some sin, blocked by some mistake,
[1:32:02] blocked by whatever it be. Lord, there's
[1:32:04] many things that clog up our channels. I
[1:32:07] pray, God, as my with my hand raised,
[1:32:09] Lord, that you would unblock those
[1:32:11] channels tonight.
[1:32:13] Lord, let us realize this so simple yet
[1:32:17] so powerful, so wonderful, so simple,
[1:32:19] but so wonderful of a truth that you
[1:32:22] started this. We didn't start it. And
[1:32:25] you're going to finish it, Lord.
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; You're going to finish what you started.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; I believe it, Lord, with all of my
[1:32:34] heart. There's something that you're
[1:32:37] doing that's beyond what man can do.
[1:32:43] Lord, I just feel your presence right
[1:32:46] now. Just want to say, Lord, don't let
[1:32:49] anything in my life hinder you. Lord,
[1:32:53] don't let anything Lord that I would do
[1:32:55] get in your way.
[1:32:58] But Lord, I believe that you could
[1:33:00] start, Lord, just as you did there in
[1:33:02] Pentecost. That was the original pattern
[1:33:06] from the very ground zero, the very
[1:33:08] beginning. We add so much to it. Lord,
[1:33:11] you didn't want us to. It's so simple.
[1:33:12] Why would we want to complicate it?
[1:33:16] Why would we want to complicate these
[1:33:17] truths that we have? Lord, I pray you'd
[1:33:19] just break us back down to ground zero.
[1:33:22] When Peter preached his first sermon and
[1:33:24] said, when they said, men and brethren,
[1:33:26] they were pricked in their hearts and
[1:33:28] said, "What must I do to be saved?"
[1:33:33] They didn't say, "What can I not do?
[1:33:35] What can I not do?" Dos and don'ts and
[1:33:37] dos and don'ts. It wasn't the question.
[1:33:39] What can I do, Lord? And you gave them
[1:33:41] an answer. Here's what you can do.
[1:33:43] Repent. That's where it starts. It's got
[1:33:46] to start right there. You cannot go any
[1:33:49] further than the depth and the level of
[1:33:52] a person's repentance.
[1:33:54] I pray God that you would bring us back
[1:33:56] to that simple place of Pentecost
[1:34:00] where Peter said,"Repent
[1:34:03] and be baptized every one of you in the
[1:34:06] name of the Lord Jesus for the remission
[1:34:08] of your sins and you shall receive the
[1:34:11] gift of the Holy Ghost. For the promise
[1:34:13] is unto you and to your children and to
[1:34:16] them that are a far off." We got a lot
[1:34:18] of them far off, Lord, but the promise
[1:34:20] is still for them, too. As many as the
[1:34:22] Lord our God shall call. We believe
[1:34:25] that, oh God, that you're still calling.
[1:34:28] There's still a apostolic age going on,
[1:34:31] you're still calling men. You're still
[1:34:33] bringing them to repentance. You're
[1:34:35] still convicting them of sin. You're
[1:34:37] still equipping for the ministry. You're
[1:34:39] still equipping the church and edifying
[1:34:41] the body, Lord, through the gifts that
[1:34:43] you've brought to us. There's an age, an
[1:34:46] apostolic age, and that inalienable
[1:34:48] right is still ours, Lord God. So
[1:34:51] simple, so wonderful. Let us not leave
[1:34:54] that, Lord. If we've strayed from it,
[1:34:56] let us come back to it. That's what a
[1:34:59] true revival is. Your prophet taught us
[1:35:00] a true revival is not about music. It's
[1:35:03] not about emotion. It's not about
[1:35:05] education. It's not about big numbers. A
[1:35:08] true revival is not about big crowds. Uh
[1:35:10] but every true revival is when men get
[1:35:14] back to the word.
[1:35:16] So God, I just invite anyone here under
[1:35:19] the sound of my voice to say, "Lord, if
[1:35:21] I've strayed from the word, not my
[1:35:23] opinion, not my thought, but the
[1:35:25] original word. If I've strayed, God, I
[1:35:28] want to come back tonight to the word."
[1:35:30] That's real revival.
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; Let us get back to these simple things,
[1:35:34] Lord,
[1:35:36] and cut out all of the other voices in
[1:35:39] her life.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; Let it be, Jesus, I pray. Let it be.
[1:35:44] What are you singing, Brother Ken? Sing
[1:35:45] it.
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; Oh, let's raise our hands and sing it

[1:41:24] Got some prayer requests here written
[1:41:25] down
[1:41:28] from brother Mark Lowry says for this
[1:41:29] evening prayer request please pray we
[1:41:31] sell our RV. We are believing it sold
[1:41:34] already. Amen.
[1:41:36] from Sister Melissa. Prayer request for
[1:41:38] a two-month old baby named Ren having
[1:41:40] trouble breathing. The doctors found she
[1:41:42] has fluid around her liver and an
[1:41:45] enlarged liver. Also pray for my
[1:41:47] daughter Jessica as she will be
[1:41:48] traveling abroad in the next few weeks.
[1:41:50] Also, I have some unspoken request.
[1:41:53] Sister Sarah Jce writes, "Jackson is at
[1:41:55] home tonight and I'm feeling well,
[1:41:57] headache and nausea. If you could put
[1:41:59] that in the prayer request, I'd
[1:42:01] appreciate it, Jackson." Sister Caitlyn
[1:42:03] Vel says, "Developed a kidney stone and
[1:42:06] kidney infection, my and needs a touch
[1:42:09] from the Lord." Amen. We're going to
[1:42:11] pray for that. Amen. Suffering. Um,
[1:42:14] Amen. That's all the written needs that
[1:42:17] I have that I have. Maybe you can, if
[1:42:19] you have an uplifted hand, you just want
[1:42:20] to represent a need, maybe you didn't
[1:42:22] get time to write down, why don't you
[1:42:23] just hold that hand up to the Lord.
[1:42:26] Amen. Let us do that. Let's put our hand
[1:42:29] over on that person just to bind
[1:42:30] together. Amen. That's what the prophet
[1:42:34] taught us. You touch your hand over on
[1:42:36] somebody and your light connects with
[1:42:38] their light and Amen. We draw out.
[1:42:42] Yes. Also, brother Robert Morero, that
[1:42:44] they have a safe trip. They had to leave
[1:42:45] out early to make it to Atlanta. Amen.
[1:42:48] Just put your hand over there on that
[1:42:50] next one and let's just call out to the
[1:42:51] Lord on these needs. Jesus, Lord, this
[1:42:55] is my testimony. You are greater than
[1:42:59] any of these requests, Lord. You've
[1:43:02] proven yourself time and time again,
[1:43:04] Lord. That you're greater than any need,
[1:43:06] physical, emotional, financial,
[1:43:11] Lord, whatever it would be tonight. You
[1:43:13] see all these needs that have been
[1:43:14] written down, Lord God, and they're
[1:43:16] challenges for us, Lord, but they're not
[1:43:18] challenges for you, Lord. You're greater
[1:43:21] than them. And we call upon the name of
[1:43:23] Jesus as a body of believers. Lord, as
[1:43:25] we join hand in hand, arm in- arm, Lord
[1:43:28] God, we call upon your name, Jehovah
[1:43:31] Gyra, our provider. Jehovah Rafa, you're
[1:43:34] our healer. I pray you'd go, Lord, and
[1:43:36] sell this RV for brother Mark. We make
[1:43:39] that request, Lord. You said make your
[1:43:41] request known. We do it now for Sister
[1:43:43] Melissa, Lord, and this baby Ren, Lord,
[1:43:46] having trouble breathing. Oh, God.
[1:43:48] You're the giver of breath, Lord. And I
[1:43:50] pray that you would come and give breath
[1:43:52] to this little baby. Lord God, the
[1:43:54] doctors found fluid around her liver.
[1:43:56] May you come now, God, and come and make
[1:43:58] the difference, Jesus. May an angel,
[1:44:01] Lord God, of healing just bring a
[1:44:02] testimony, Lord, that we'll share. I
[1:44:05] pray, God, also for Jessica, who's
[1:44:07] traveling, keep her, Lord, in your care,
[1:44:09] Jackson, at home tonight, not feeling
[1:44:11] well, headache and nausea. I pray you'd
[1:44:13] come and touch our brother just now,
[1:44:15] Lord. Even on the wings of this prayer,
[1:44:17] go to Sister Caitlyn, Lord God, who's
[1:44:19] suffering with this kidney infection. I
[1:44:21] pray that you would miraculously come
[1:44:23] and bring healing to my sister now. Oh
[1:44:26] God, for each and every single one of
[1:44:27] these needs, Brother Robert on his way,
[1:44:29] Lord, traveling, I pray, God, that you
[1:44:31] would bring strength, Lord. And as we've
[1:44:33] preached, Lord, and we've sang, I pray,
[1:44:35] God, that you would grant that desire of
[1:44:37] our heart. Maybe we could pray it like
[1:44:39] David, Lord. Take not your spirit from
[1:44:42] me, but renew unto me. restore the joy
[1:44:46] of my salvation. I pray God you would
[1:44:48] come and do it to each person here.
[1:44:51] Lord, if they're not filled with that
[1:44:53] baptism of the Holy Ghost, it's still
[1:44:55] here tonight for them, Lord. It's still
[1:44:59] a definite experience that they can
[1:45:00] have. It is still their ticket to a
[1:45:03] rapture and a body change without it
[1:45:05] which, Lord, there won't be one. I pray
[1:45:07] God that if we'd have those who are lost
[1:45:09] amongst us, save them, oh God. Save them
[1:45:12] from their sins. I pray we'd have those
[1:45:14] that are downcast and downtrodden. I
[1:45:17] pray that you would be the lifter up of
[1:45:19] their heads just now. Lord, those that
[1:45:21] are filled but want to say, "I need a
[1:45:23] refilling of the Holy Ghost." Oh, come
[1:45:26] and quench this thirst in my soul. I
[1:45:28] pray you'd do it for our church. Do it
[1:45:30] for Lord, your children. We pray every
[1:45:33] hand, Lord, that was unspoken and
[1:45:35] raised. I pray that you would come and
[1:45:36] meet the need, Jesus. We give you all
[1:45:38] the glory, all the honor, and all the
[1:45:40] praise in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:45:43] Christ. Amen. And amen. Amen. Brother
[1:45:46] Ken, you got something you're playing?
[1:45:48] Sing it for us. We'll just sing maybe
[1:45:50] one before we go.
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; Let's sing this together.
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; Praise you again and again.
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, you want to raise your hands to the
[1:46:00] Lord now? Cuz all that I have is a
[1:46:04] hallelujah.
[1:46:06] [Music]
[1:46:15] And I know it's not much, but I've
[1:46:18] nothing else fit for a king
[1:46:24] except for a heart singing hallelujah.
[1:46:28] [Music]
[1:46:32] Hallelujah.
[1:46:34] [Music]
[1:46:37] So I throw up my hands and praise you.
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; Praise you again and again.
[1:46:45] Oh yes. Cuz all that I have is a
[1:46:50] hallelujah.
[1:46:51] [Music]
[1:46:55] Hallelujah.
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[1:47:00] And I know it's not much. I'm nothing
[1:47:04] else fit for the king.
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.

[1:47:13] [Music]
[1:47:18] Hallelujah.
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; Could you sing the verse?
[1:47:24] [Music]
[1:47:26] Let's sing this verse now. All my words
[1:47:30] fall short.
[1:47:32] [Music]
[1:47:34] I got nothing new.
[1:47:39] How could I express?
[1:47:43] Oh my gratitude. Oh my gratitude.
[1:47:49] I could sing these songs. I could sing
[1:47:52] these songs
[1:47:56] as I often do.
[1:47:59] [Music]
[1:48:02] But every song must stand
[1:48:07] and you never do.
[1:48:13] So I throw up my hands and praise you
[1:48:17] again and again. Oh yes, Lord. All that
[1:48:23] I have is hallelujah.
[1:48:26] [Music]
[1:48:31] Hallelujah.
[1:48:33] [Music]

[1:49:08] I just just one move
[1:49:14] with my arms stretched wide.
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; Come on. You don't need music. You don't
[1:49:21] need music to worship the Lord. If we
[1:49:22] don't got it, we'll sing anyways.
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; So I throw up my hands. Come on,
[1:49:27] friends.
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; Praise you.
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; Praise him. He's worthy of it.

[1:52:28] time for one if anybody has one. But
[1:52:30] Caleb, it's it's dead. Brother Brad.
[1:52:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:35] Red mic. Caleb, sorry. You got a
[1:52:38] testimony tonight. Come up here.
[1:52:45] Just wanted to give the Lord uh praise
[1:52:46] for this. I had someone come into the
[1:52:48] office. It's been about a year ago now.
[1:52:50] And they came in and they had worn
[1:52:53] hearing aids before. Uh they were
[1:52:55] looking for something, you know, better,
[1:52:57] new, and so we fit her. Um she's, I
[1:53:00] think, in her 60s. And uh we just have
[1:53:04] had a difficult time trying to get her
[1:53:07] speech understanding where it needs to
[1:53:09] be. And for the first two or three
[1:53:12] months, I tried several different
[1:53:14] things, different hearing aids,
[1:53:15] different kinds of fittings, different
[1:53:17] things. I just couldn't do it. I
[1:53:18] referred it out to the guy who I work
[1:53:21] with who's been doing it a lot longer
[1:53:22] than I have. And he was kind of at a
[1:53:24] loss for he worked with her for several
[1:53:26] months. We've basically seen her every
[1:53:29] week or every other week for a year now
[1:53:31] and trying to get her, you know, where
[1:53:33] she needed to be. And I finally had a
[1:53:35] conversation with her about a month ago
[1:53:37] and I just said, "Look, you know, it
[1:53:39] might be time to look into something
[1:53:41] more than hearing aids, you know, coar
[1:53:42] implants and and referring you out to
[1:53:44] somebody to kind of do that." And um she
[1:53:47] had already considered that, you know,
[1:53:49] and and and she just said, you know,
[1:53:51] that was that was something that she had
[1:53:52] in the back of her mind, but she really
[1:53:54] didn't want to go that route yet. And so
[1:53:56] I just prayed. I hadn't I hadn't prayed
[1:53:58] about it. So I just said, "Lord, I
[1:53:59] really want to help this lady and if
[1:54:01] there's something that we can do to help
[1:54:02] her, would you just show me?" And so I
[1:54:05] just went back to the drawing board and
[1:54:06] I just retested her hearing and we just
[1:54:09] did something real simple and she went
[1:54:11] for two weeks. She came back in last
[1:54:13] week with a big glowing smile on her
[1:54:15] face and she said that she was hearing
[1:54:17] better than she had in a really long
[1:54:19] time. And uh you know I told her that I
[1:54:21] just said you know I she said after that
[1:54:24] conversation she said that was tough but
[1:54:26] I was just holding out hope that I
[1:54:27] didn't have to go that route yet. And um
[1:54:30] she said just the last couple weeks I've
[1:54:31] been hearing better than I have in the
[1:54:33] last year but before a long time. So I
[1:54:36] just wanted to praise the Lord for that.
[1:54:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you.
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; This is a couple months ago. Um, I
[1:54:48] wanted to give this um, so me and Elijah
[1:54:51] were I think going to Kevin and Sarah's
[1:54:53] house or on the way back and um, so
[1:54:58] Elijah keeps me in check when I'm
[1:55:00] driving. Make sure you're not speeding.
[1:55:02] So he was telling me like, "Hey, Dad,
[1:55:04] you shouldn't you shouldn't go over the
[1:55:06] speed limit." He was watching my speed
[1:55:08] carefully and I was like, "You're right.
[1:55:10] I'm going to go the speed limit." So
[1:55:12] there was a truck in front of me and um
[1:55:17] if
[1:55:18] you know going you know what whatever I
[1:55:20] was going maybe 10 over or something I'm
[1:55:22] not sure but I would have uh I would
[1:55:25] have gotten I gotten ahead of him but
[1:55:27] since Elijah
[1:55:29] said corrected me says you need to go to
[1:55:31] the speed limit I got behind him and as
[1:55:34] we're driving along
[1:55:36] sure enough a car pulled out in front of
[1:55:38] that guy and just t-boned him. So if I
[1:55:42] would have been there, yeah,
[1:55:43] &gt;&gt; of course I would have got hit before
[1:55:46] that truck. So thank the Lord in the
[1:55:48] life too.
[1:55:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[1:55:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Even brother Kevin's clapping.
[1:55:59] Anybody else got one one more before we
[1:56:01] go? Nobody. Amen. You love the Lord
[1:56:04] Jesus.
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're going to let you go. Be
[1:56:07] dismissed. Amen. Brother Ken to sing
[1:56:09] something that as we go.

[1:56:17] darkness.
