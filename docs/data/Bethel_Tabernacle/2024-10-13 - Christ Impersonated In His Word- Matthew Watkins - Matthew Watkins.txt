bless you thank you amen for all the worship God bless you we are um just um so excited to uh be living for the Lord in this dark Wicked World and uh so glad that we have a light amen that has shined into our hearts and made everything else make sense you know what you look at the world today and and uh you look at the condition of politics and my I could just name every single category and I just think to myself Lord where would I be if I was just Meandering ing out here in the world living just with the hope of another president or you know some kind of social system and I just thank God who who am I Lord that I find myself under the revealed word of this hour not confused not just Meandering but I've I've got a revelation in my heart that all things that are taking place are not just random or happening or happen stance but they're right on time amen friends God is an on time God am amen and I'm glad how many glad is to be serving that God Amen God bless you we just want you to if you could turn to your Bible to the book of First John um very familiar 1 John chapter 1 and I would like to just minister to you this morning we we have a quite a bit to do after the uh service today and so I just want to make sure that got out clear um I sent out that announcement that we're going to be starting Lord willing at 1:30 p.m. we'll start uh to take down disassemble and to load up the U-Haul and so uh just get there will be those that uh will be in charge of that and so we just hands as many of them as possible raise up your hand say right here if you got a right hand raise it up raise it up if you got a right hand if you don't have one don't raise it you got a left hand raise up that left hand too now you see all those hands those those hands are important and they're going to be really important today so you say well what can I do to help just use those hands and uh it'll help us tremendously there's a lot that goes into it and so uh we got quite a bit there that uh we've got to load up so if you're able at all to come at 1:30 I'm going to do my best to be abbreviated today and um I'm going to set a timer and I know some of y'all are going to show how much you don't believe in miracles when I say this but I'm going to try to hold my sermon to 40 to 45 minutes and so um we'll see how that goes but um I really want to my dad is a way Minister and we just want to remember him in Phoenix and Arizona he's ministering this morning there a few hours behind he possibly would be streaming this so we want to be remembered him and any others uh that are out ministering amen 1 John chapter 1 we'll just begin reading here at verse seven let's let's back it up and let's move to verse five this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that God is light and in him is no Darkness at all if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie you see the impossibility because there's no darkness in him at all so if we say we walk with him and we walk in darkness then we we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses us so notice what the light brings cleansing what is the only thing that can cleanse you tell me somebody what is the only thing that brings cleansing power the blood only one so the light is connected to the blood right so if let's read it again if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses us from all sin if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in US here's the beautiful part but if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness Lord we just need your help this morning I know father that there would be so many here Lord that would gather and Lord they are here for one purpose and that's to see you Lord uh I just want to say today God may we see you Lord hide me behind the cross this morning Lord let let us have a true Mount Transfiguration experience where we see no man but we see Jesus I pray God that you would touch every heart touch every life Lord May the word find its proper place place today we ask it in Jesus Christ's name and the church said amen you can be seated if you'll give me that PowerPoint brother Mark I'll just go ahead and read this first uh uh quote here and this is where I draw my title from my title is Christ impersonated in his word Christ impersonated in his word I want you to notice because I'm going to be very brief and and uh this morning and rather than laying a large Foundation would us get straight to some of the meat of this of what we got what we have on our heart Christ impersonated in his word so you have two things there you have Christ and you have his word and so then you have this word in the middle impersonated now not in the sense of being impersonated like an impersonator person who's a mockery or making fun of or impersonate another person but break that word down it's Christ in impersonated so the person of Christ being revealed in his word you followed me so far so notice what brother brandham says here and this is out of the message the Feast of the trumpets in 1964 and I know it's very familiar to you and the seventh Angel's message under the same trumpet same everything exactly the same seal is to what to call the people the bride out of that's the elected not the church but the bride it's to call the bride out of the Pentecostal and World Tradition now if you go and read this message the Feast of the trumpets you'll know clearly that the prophet is picking up from pointing to what the prophets of Revelations chap 11 show and and you see that the entire sermon is about the Jews and Israel being called back by a Moses and Elijah to the genuine atonement to the true word and so brother bam is paralleling the the what the the what the the Gentiles receive an Elijah and so also the Jews will recognize their prophets can you say amen amen and so he's paralleling that and he says here out of the so also the seventh Angel's message under the same trumpet same everything the same seal is to do what to call the people the bride out of the Pentecostal and World tradition to the genuine atonement the word so what is the genuine atonement Christ impersonated in his word or Christ becoming the person of his word notice here he says impersonated here he says his word made flesh Among Us science has proved it by pictures so notice here as brother Brandon begins to show this here and and I just want to make sure I don't want to read this next slide yet um uh let me make sure I have this correctly yes so notice he says Christ impersonated in his word we took a long time last Sunday the last Sunday that we spoke and we spoke quite a bit about light you remember that sermon that we that we spoke on don't make me repr preach it you remember what I spoke about with light and so we took a lot of time to show you that there was a re ation that was uh uh revealed or a mystery that was broken in this age of first John 1:7 that Christ that God is light and there was a mystery surrounding the light we showed you that also that you'll find in Revelations 4 a throne is revealed and it wasn't a literal throne but it was all symbology that there was a throne and and around that Throne were the seven stars of God and and in the right hand of God meaning the position of authority that God said out of the throne in the throne dwells the light and surrounding the light God says that there's 24 Elders that was 12 Tribes of 12 sons of Jacob and the the representing the Jews and the 12 tribes of Israel I'm sorry uh uh the 12 apostles represented the Gentile church and so notice he was we were showing you that to get to Christ to get to the throne you've got to come under the light you will never have light unless you receive it from one of the stars that God has in his right hand and so any man doesn't matter Jew Gentile study Torah study the Greek manuscript Hebrew manuscript study Theology and all of these all of these things that they go to school for for years the only light that they can receive from God must come from the source of Light which is Christ which is God which is Jehovah which is all the same thing and so it has to come from God it has to come from that Throne of God because in the throne is the embodiment of all of the light of God and so notice the Bible says that in the days of the voice of the seventh angel all the mysteries of God the mystery of God will be revealed So within the seventh Angel's message contain the mystery of God friends I I I I I want you this this is incredible to me when you look at this because you'll find that brother bham is taking time that as a doning on himself who he was in the scripture who his ministry was in the scripture the anointing that he was under because early on he didn't understand the lion anointing the ox anointing the the man anointing the eagle anointing but there was a transition in his own Ministry when he recognizes that he's under that Elijah Ministry of Malachi 4 and he's also not only under an El Ministry but he puts his Bible on Joshua 1 and says as I was with Moses amen so shall I be with you so you say what is that seventh Angel's message it's the ministry of Moses a prophet God sent a prophet to call uh God sent Moses a prophet to call Israel out of Egypt so we have also received a Moses Messenger to call us out of world Traditions unto a genuine atonement so what have you received in under the seventh angel you received a Moses to call you out of the plagues of Egypt and give you a token somebody preached with me this morning that is not just for you but for all of your family and it was to bring a token under a Moses Ministry but don't stop there he wasn't just a Moses he was also the Holy Ghost Ministry of Joshua as I was with Moses so shall I be unto you but further than that that he was an Elijah Ministry to turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers but and all of that I I want you to I want to make sure I cover this very important key uh here today and that is who is the seventh angel yeah amen question who is the seventh angel who was the sixth who was the fifth who was the fourth who was the third who was the second who was the first yeah well let me ask you what the Bible says about John the Baptist the Bible says that John who was to do what was to introduce Christ how many knows that John's Ministry was the ministry of the Book of Malachi chapter 3 and chapter 4 the hearts of the children notice this now there would be a parallel between John who was under the anointing of Elijah and then the anointing that would also that Jesus says Elijah must did come but he must also come and restore all things so what was the first Ministry of John it was to introduce Jesus Christ how many Bible readers do we have here this morning it was to introduce to say Behold the Lamb of God and John would say I am not that light but I've come to Bear witness unto that light Hallelujah so if John was not the light then how could any of the messengers be the light they weren't they were simply the bearers of that light and so to back to our original point to get light from the throne God said here's how it's going to come I'm going to have in my right hand which means Authority and power I'm going to equip them with a special Ministry and in my right hand is Seven Stars and through Seven Ages there would be a start to each age and if you lived under the light of that messenger you were walking in the light as he is in the light and that light brought cleansing and atonement amen I want you to notice because it's so powerful because as we said you have to understand that the mystery surrounding the nature of God was sealed and I don't want to get bogged down into that we took a lot of time uh showing you that that under Dan CH 12 that there was a mystery that was sealed up you remember that how many hands could could just raise and say I I remember the scripture in Daniel Daniel seal up the book don't write the you know seal it up Daniel for knowledge shall increase many shall run to and fro and no notice here so there was a mystery contained in that but then Revelations 10:7 says that the mystery of God under that seventh messenger would be finished so in other words they couldn't understand God until the voice of that Angel sounds and so a as as that light begins to come I want you to notice because brother Adam starts preaching a series of messages and if you've never caught it before in this way I I hope I could just show you in a way that it for me it was just a a light bulb no pun intended light bulb moment there because you notice even the titles that brother bam starts to name his sermons because he's trying to get the people to understand something has taken place this isn't just normal churchianity this isn't just normal filling time this isn't this is a profit this is a a gift of Divine Healing but it's not just a gift of Divine Healing amen hello it's it's a gift of Divine Healing but it's not just a gift of Divine Healing find my place here I want to want to make sure I get to this because it was yes thank you Lord so notice this here how you view Jesus I want to say this slowly will determine what you get from Jesus amen how many knows here today that if you were to ask a thousand people you would have almost a thousand different opinions if you ask them who is Jesus now you'd have a lot of gen generally the same but you would have varying opinions but remember how you view him will determine what you get out of him I don't have this on the slides but listen to what brother bam says in the identified Christ of all ages so many people have so many opinions of Christ as I travel different parts of the country and around the world I find so many people have their different opinions you you'd be surprised to know what their opinions are some of them thinks that he's just a wonderful teacher you ask a Muslim that the Muslims will tell you further than that he was a prophet but some would just believe he was just a teacher right well now listen how brother B says this well now he was that he was a wonderful teacher yeah but remember what I said how you view him will determine what you get out of him so in other words if you just viewed Jesus as a wonderful teacher what would you get you'd get good teaching amen so if you viewed him as a wonderful teacher you'd get good teaching that's all you'd get from him well he was that that's just exactly many thinks that he was a great philosopher brother brandham says he was that so if you viewed him as a great philosopher what would you get out of him philosophy right amen well he was that just exactly the same certainly he was some thinks that he was a good man how many would raise their hand and say I believe Jesus was a good man amen he was that but see he was more than that oh yeah I love how brother mam says this he was all of that plus amen some of them think he was a prophet he was a prophet but he was more than a prophet he was what the prophets were was plus am somebody say plus he was what the prophets was plus so what would we know now if he was teaching his teachings he was a teacher he was a great philosopher now then brother Brandon points to Hebrews and says we believe that he's the same yesterday today and forever how many believe that if Jesus is the same today yesterday and today and forever then if he was a good man he's still a good man if he was a good teacher he's still a good teacher he's all of those things he was he still is right and so he says and I'm always with you I'll never forsake you until the end of the world I'll never leave one of the one of the principles about the Bible that brother random said was the key to unlock the Bible was this that God doesn't change I'm so glad for that how many are glad for that I'm so glad God doesn't change Hallelujah so in other words if I can meet him on the basis of the word he has to give me the same result cuz he doesn't change and so brother B sister now those words are either true or they're not true and he says and if they're not true if Jesus is just historical and he's not the same and he's not alive and he's not existing and he's not still speaking then what are we doing here right it's words brother Brandon uses then what are we doing here the words are either not and if they're not what are we doing here tonight in other words we're wretched people we're people that's deceived the whole Christian world is deceived if he isn't the same yesterday today and forever you see people are so comfortable with a God that you can lock up in a book amen help me preach somebody the human mind is so comfortable as long as you seal him to one book because you see when he's not still speaking and that's what the God everything God said he said already and we have it in his word then what you can do is is you can have opinions about this and opinions about that and well I see it differently over here and there's textual variance if you look at the manuscript the Mark chapter 7 uh you know was wasn't the woman at the well was not origin in the Bible and and then the woman at the well wasn't and you know Jesus said these signs shall follow you can have all kinds of opinions if you seal him in a book that's right but when Christ was revealed through a seventh Angel's message it revealed Christ has been unveiled and he's not just the god of history but he's the I am present tense God and not only did he speak he's still speaking amen list L what brother brandom says I love this so much he says if he isn't alive tonight and with us as he promised we're we're miserable notice this they're either true or they're not true so notice what brother Bron begins to say as he as as as a transition has taken place as something has changed there's been there's been a a a a as brother bandam calls it concerning the seventh seal he says that there's been a beat I think is the word he uses of the Symphony yeah changes and so he said there's a there's a transition there's a junction of there's a junction there there's a transition something is taking place and he's showing this here and he begins to change the titles he begins to give the titles I want you to catch some of these because he begins to title his his sermons and and then he would preach messages like this who do you say this is yeah amen recognizing your day and its message the God of this it's one thing to see the god of that evil age but the God of this evil age this day this day this scripture is fulfilled are you catching it amen notice the title of this sermon in 1964 a greater than Solomon is here now that's in the Bible remember in the Book of Matthew Jesus says I say unto you there's one greater than than Solomon one greater than the temple but listen to the title of this prophet's message a greater than Solomon is here now amen amen listen right after that the identified Christ of all ages notice this the presence then he preaches a message called the presence of God unrecognized are you seeing that there's a there's a there's a theme Here notice what he preaches right after that God has provided a lamb amen here's another one the Mighty God unveiled before us not who he was but who he is then he preaches a powerful one that I love so much much who is this MDC oh I know who mzc was brother Matt when he appeared to Abraham and to Sarah there but I say unto you who is this mzc because brother bandman that sermon shows that mzc comes three times threefolds three-fold purpose and so he says who is this mzc I listed these and these were so amazing just out of the message is this the sign of the answer and if you want this document I I'll get it I'll get it to you because I believe it's just so good to study I want you to notice you say brother mat what Mysteries were restored under that seventh messenger if that revelation of that message was to do this to turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers what are some of those Mysteries s incredible I actually can find and you may find more 17 Mysteries that were restored under the message of Malachi four that he lists in is this the sign of the end Ser powerful let me read you some of them number one Mysteries restored the mystery of the Kingdom of Heaven that's Matthew 13 The Mystery of Israel's blindness during this age that's Romans 11 uh the mystery of the translation of the living Saints how many living Saints are here at the end of this age that's First Corinthians we know very well 15 and also Thessalonians 4 here's another one Number Four The Mystery of the New Testament Church as one body composed of both Jews and Gentiles Ephesians 3 Romans 16 Ephesians 6 Colossians 4 here's number five The Mystery of the church as the bride of Christ number six The Mystery of the living Christ who is the same yesterday today and forever so Hebrews 138 would be a mystery locked that would come under remember what our title is Christ impersonated in his word and so notice here the mystery of Christ the same yesterday today and forever that's Galatians 2 that's Hebrews 13:8 here's number seven the mystery of God which is Christ as the Incarnate fullness of the godhead embodied in whom all Divine wisdom now then he stops and he inserts this the mystery of godliness restored to man great is the mystery of godliness whose words were that whose words am I quoting great is the mystery of godliness come on Bible believing church I'm not quoting brother Brandon I'm quoting the Apostle Paul for great is the Myst of godliness for God was manifested what is it it's the nature surrounding God that he's not three and he's also not one like your finger is number eight I'm sorry number nine second Thessalonians the mystery of iniquity was revealed in this age as Paul said the mystery of iniquity which does now already work right revelation 1 120 number 10 The Mystery of the Seven Stars the mystery of Babylon the mystery of mystery Babylon The Prostitute that's number 11 number 12 The Mystery of the serpent seed number 13 The Mystery of Grace straightened out not disgrace but real true Grace you see people that say well brother baram you know he had some good good teachings and you know good few things over here and hey brought listen friends I don't think you realize the magnitude of the Mysteries that were restored to a gentile bride under a seventh angel message the mystery of Grace and not disgrace the mystery of no Eternal burning hell anything that was eternal had a beginning and must have an end hell was created how many know that Am Number 15 The Mystery of the baptism of the Holy Ghost without sensation but the person of Christ performing in you the same works that he did that was a mystery the mystery of water baptism the mystery here was one number 17 that I think is so powerful and profound The Mystery of the this is what God's Prophet said the mystery of the pillar of fire returning back to the church amen amen those were all Mysteries that were contained and restored I want you to notice here because even brother brandham says this in the message Christ is revealed in his own word so let me pause that for a moment so in other words what is brother bam doing through those titles he's trying to get you to see something that's taking place here there's a there's a there's a ministry that's beyond a man it's beyond a man it's beyond a Kentucky seventh grade education it's beyond signs and wonders thank God for the miraculous thank God for the dead being raised thank God for blind eyes being open how many are thankful that God is the god of Miracles how many are thankful that we witness those the miraculous in the ministry of a seventh angel so that I can have faith that that same God is the same God today as he was back then and he still performs the same Miracles but can I just say it's none of those things that attracts me to the message of the seventh angel you say then what was it brother Matt that was just to get the attention when the when those uh when those Fish Little Fish scattered the rainbow TR you say what was it then it was the revelation of the word which is Christ the same yesterday today and forever being revealed once again say how was he revealed he was impersonated in human flesh and so notice I want you to get this here and go ahead and and if you could I want you to listen to this this is this is incredible I want you to play that for me brother Mark if you could have the computer unmuted I I want you just to play this I'm just going to it's probably 10 minutes long I only play a minute of it I just want you to hear a snippet of this I want to show you something go ahead and start that at any time and in the back two if you can make sure wow turn it up thison shared with us the invisible Union of the of Christ there's a lot to uned yeah a lot Thanksgiving Day 1965 Life Tabernacle stre Port Louisiana pretty intense yeah and you know scene Thanksgiving gratitude all of that and uses the woman to illustrate the church well it's really interesting how he connects the natural world to the spiritual right he's taking something that everyone understands this idea of marriage to kind of explain this really complex relationship between the church and Christ and he's saying you know just like a woman's action they kind of show her character the church's actions they reflect its Devotion to Christ and he really does seem to be saying that how at least in 1965 how women were behaving showed that the church was drifting from the word yeah he really calls out you know what's going on in the world even using examples of you know what movie stars are doing on screen how that influences young people right like they're setting a bad example exactly and then you got these fashion trends he actually calls women's clothing insane and talks about these parties where women are picking keys out of a hat to figure out who they're going to live with for the weekend why so he's saying that Society is influencing the church in a bad way yeah I mean this is 1965 time massive of people you got Civil Rights Movement the Vietnam War women are pushing for more rights and freedoms and grah sees all of this change especially when it comes to women's rol as a sign of spiritual decline but he's saying the world is going one way and the church is just following right along instead of sticking to those Poe teachings makes sense he get into denominations doesn't it he calls them adulterous strong words yeah so what's going on there okay so for GR it all goes down to this that pure direct connection of God that's what matters he sees denominations as this kind of like I don't know a betrayal of that direct link like you're basically saying okay I'm going to follow these manmade rules and traditions instead of just listening to God directly it's like he's saying you can't serve two Master it's about that direct line no middle okay stop it there now I got a question for you who did you just hear who were those podcasters what show is that brother Matt can you give me the link that woman and that man that I heard that man and that woman don't exist that was artificial intelligence Google Gemini speaking to you I'll let that settle just for a moment some of y'all just went white that man doesn't exist never has that woman never existed that was me taking the invisible Union sermon uploading it took 3 seconds spitting out the podcast took five minutes and it's a full summary of two people rationalizing and reasoning that sermon artificial intelligence now I want to show you what God's Prophet said listen to Christ as revealed in his own word if you can put that PowerPoint back up for me then it started right back coming back come back from the feet now notice as brother brandham shows that restoration and he shows how it started God begin to come up through the feet what is what are we talking about feet for because we're talking about a body what body the body of Christ and he says it started coming right up the church come from the feet now it's in the head time notice the light you can't see with your hands how many would agree yet it's part of the body how many would agree you can't see with the ears yet it it can hear you can't see with the nose yet it smells you can't see with the lips though it speaks see that was the Pentecostal age why does he point to that because through Martin through Luther through Wesley you were moving up through the feet through the body what were you getting in that you were the the restoration all of it was typing a rest restoration of Christ approaching or moving back to his body so Christ was cast out but he's coming back the same Jesus who you stand why stand you gazing men of Galilee the same Jesus who ascended shall also descend shall also come back but you see so many people have so many opinions of Christ they see The Return of Christ as one great event that just trumpet sound and then you know down out of this plane or this skies are going to roll back and this carpet's going to come down and then Jesus is going to come back and and they think that's the return of Christ now you say brother Matt do you believe that there's a physical Corporal I do but I believe what the Bible said that we meet that Jesus in the air what is that that's not in the air that's in the atmosphere the dimensions between this one and that one remember what brother brandom says when you die when you breathe your last breath you don't go A Million Miles Away he says you simply change dimensions and what you were here you are there hello and so we meet him in that other dimension in the air so he's not he's coming back as a physical coming but what you Misses is the return of Christ comes in three phases that Jesus is the word how many believe that Jesus is his own word so as I said before you can't say you love Jesus if you don't love his word you love an idea you love the imagination Jesus that you've been taught or you're theorized in your mind and you think he just loves everybody doesn't matter weeks it at any kind of sin he's just grateful and you know that great ad that they' put out during the Super Bowl called he gets us and he shows all kinds of transgender homosexuals and then the line is Jesus he gets us oh and so it's this m ized hybridized version of Jesus that brings temporary salvation it bring in other words it brings some type of temporary relief of the conscience but it doesn't save the soul because the only thing that cleanses is the blood and the only way to get the blood is the light and the only way to get the light is to come under the light for your age and and I I just want to take a moment here how many moments do I have Siri I have 10 more moments it's 10 more minutes are you still with me here this morning because notice this here this is the fear this is the this is the risk I didn't have time to put these up but I just want to take a moment to insert this and we'll come back to what we heard with Gemini and Google I I want to come back to that here in a moment but I want to show you the danger because as I said how you view him will determine what you get out of him and so how much confidence let me make it more simple how much confidence you have in the word that comes through the vessel yeah amen can actually limit what you receive from the word let me make it very plain if you believe this is just a historic book and you just open it up and I'm doing my daily devotions that's good to do I'm just doing my duty as a Christian and I and I'm reading just reading good Proverbs and good lessons you'll get some good things out of it but when you view this as a living organism hello when you view this as a living person that God can speak through this the Bible becomes a whole brand new book hello and so if you see this as just a book well let me go further if you see it as just a man notice what brother Brandon was told by the angel of the Lord if you can get the people to believe amen I'll try that again if you can get the people to believe you then nothing will stand in the way of your prayers not even cancer amen you imagine as brother Brandon the pressure he was under as he came out seeing an angel of the Lord talking to the angel of the Lord yet nobody in this audience had seen him felt him talked to him and now his job is to bring the people's Faith who are down here and he's up here up to where he's at and then when he can get them people to believe this isn't just William brandom this is God Christ impersonated in his flesh in his word In the Flesh of a man then all things are possible to them that believe hlj and so notice this here if you can get the people to believe so do you see if you question it let me say it this way if you question it if you approach it from a skeptical view you can get some good out of it but it can never truly help you amen if you approach it from a critic's perspective if you question any part of it instead of accepting it as thus saith the Lord then you don't receive its benefits amen I know we we talk a lot about this about the danger of mixing or the danger of watering it down let me read you what watering it down means what does it mean to water down I'm reading this right from Cambridge Dictionary notice to intentionally make an idea a proposal or an opinion less extreme or forceful usually so that other people will accept it think of watering it down now to water down the word is to intentionally take the word and make it less extreme or forceful or absolute usually so that others will just accept it so that's what people do they water it down so that others will accept it we remove all of the parts we don't understand and only keep the parts that make perfect sense to our rationale right amen hello amen you could call this dressing it up doctoring it up make it more palpable you know it's not you know let me just say it this way this message is not for everyone amen it's not for everyone so don't try to force it on everyone a Believer an eagle sees it and and and I'll say in the words of my dad who I I love the way he said it so much he said he said if you can't see it you can't see it but if you see it it's all you [Applause] see if you catch it it's just all you see it's everything you see and so what does it mean we dilute it I looked up this word from the dictionary dilute to dilute it means to make it's make a liquid thinner or weaker by adding water or another solvent to it bleach can be diluted with cold water but you know what the problem is when you delete bleach it loses its bleach Powers amen and let me say we've received a word that has the power of bleach and it annihilates it doesn't just cover your sins it annihilates them as if you never did it in the first place you see why I want to say Lord I don't want to mix it with my idea I don't want to mix it with my opinion I don't want to look at it skeptically or I don't under even if I don't understand it listen friends I don't understand all of this message but I believe every word God's Prophet spoke because it's the power of God as Paul said un salvation to dilute it means to make it thin by adding something to it to make it thinner or weaker and so what would God do what was God going to do he would make God sent men God called men not Seminary train Not educated by theology but God sent men who could take the anointing of the seventh angel and could preach the very Zoey Seed Life do you realize when the preaching of the word is if it's not mixed with ideas and opinions it is the Zoey Seed Life Of God being sprinkled over the people and so God God sent Holy Ghost filled men with that zoy seed word and let me say the preaching of the word of God that we preach if we preach the true message that was sin and don't mix it with our opinion but is a spiritual unic in other words no seed no opinion no idea no soapbox come on somebody no bothersome no irritations but we just preach it the way a prophet preached it in its purest form I say that if you preach it that way the same power and the same anointing and the same results will come upon it and so here's what happens I I want to get to this here brother bam says this in the identified Christ I'm sorry revealed in his own word put that back up if you could that PowerPoint now it's in the head time notice the light you go back can't see with your hands you see but it was that pit notice read the last part there you can't see with the lips though it speaks but it was that Pentecostal age and so what was that dawning of that Pentecostal 1906 of zza street they begin to speak in other why did God use the tongue because the restoration had came all the way up through the feet and now it was overflowing out of the mouth amen amen right you fill up a vessel enough what does it do it eventually starts bubbling over and so they got so full with the fullness of God that they just they just they they they they begin to overflow yeah and the spirit of God as the spirit gave them utterance they spoke in other languages and other tongues because God was moving closer and closer to his body notice it was that Pentecostal age but now it's in the eye time yeah so it moves from the mouth and then it goes to the eyes see seeing now there isn't one moving faculty beyond the eye how many would agree with the prophet there's not no more hands moving no more feet moving no more mouth speaking all of those things have to either let me point that out you don't just move from the from the hands to the mouth and say oh I can cut my hands off no you still need them you don't move to the eyes and say no I don't need to speak anymore no it's not in the mouth no as brother bandam says and countdown each one of those Restorations the automobile listen just cuz we have a spaceship doesn't mean we don't need automobiles hello just cuz I got an airplane doesn't nothing doesn't mean I don't need my Toyota I still need it I don't travel Everywhere by plane so you don't do away with one of them it builds upon the next Hallelujah you don't do away with gifts but this isn't just a gift this is the person so he says there's not one moving faculty beyond the eye notice what is after the eye the next is the intelligence which is what I want you to catch this because I pointed this last time brother bam in the message countdown he preaches it multiple times and he shows us that as man in science would accomplish or discover he said it was only a reflection of where God was at invisibly in his Plan of Redemption so when they discovered automobile God was doing something when they discovered flight and brother bandam says about the time they were getting off the ground the right Brothers there was a little group in in California on a little street called isua in a little dingy dark dirty h brother B said a place no one would have ever visited and at the same time they're getting off the ground there's some Believers beginning to speak out of their mouth amen amen and so the brother brandom says but watch as Discovery scientific discovery always follows it what is after the vision what is after the the eyes of prophetic Vision the next is the intelligence which is Christ somebody say this with me it's to do what who controls the whole body amen see down through the age we started off from the foundation I got two seconds we started off from the foundation from the first church age when the seed went in the ground the complete seed now he showing you the whole process then it come through the feet Luther come back out then through Wesley then into Pentecostals the tongues and the lips see now it's in the eyes prophetic of Malachi 4 amen now don't do what so many have done and in the quote with the prophetic Malachi 4 cuz he wasn't done and now there's nothing else left for it to come but I love this him himself to step into that what did he do with mzc brother bam said he just took some dust and he stepped into a body he wrapped himself in Mary brother mam says he took that blood cell and wrapped himself the word made flesh what was it it wasn't Mary it wasn't it wasn't the seed of a man it wasn't the egg of a woman it was God himself it was Emmanuel God With us amen and so if he came into a body what's he wanting to do now he's wanting to step back into his body and I say Lord let me be available to you let my vessel how many want to say that today make my let me make myself available for that intelligence to come down to step into that's the last thing there is the next is the intelligence we we have no intelligence musicians could you come of our own we have no sight of our own he How could a man foresee those things he can't do it it's God himself see it's becoming to a place and he's governed the body all the way through then the complete body of Christ is revealed in the form of a bride that was taken out of his side like Adam did at the beginning like Adams was rather at the beginning the next is the intelligent the next God said if you can stand with me to your feet brother bam says the next thing was for him to step into a body came all the way down through the hands through the feet Through The Eyes through the mouth Through The Eyes prophetic vision and now what do we see my brother my sister what I displayed to you was complete artificial intelligence what is it it's a changing of the beat it's a changing of the sympathy listen these things are not accident it's not just AC I'm not just I'm not picking on technology I I I you you brother mat you against artificial intelligence no I'm not against my vehicle either or an airplane either but it's simply showing us where we are the next thing is the intelligence to where brother bandam says that what is it it's as The Headstone the head the headship as The Headstone nears the body you remember this quot as The Headstone nears the body those in the bride will be so much like Jesus Oh I raised my hand and say Yes Lord they will be so much like Jesus how many want that today till they will be in his very image to where God Christ is impersonated in his word Christ impersonated in his word every head [Music] bowed Christ you say what what part of him brother Matt all of him his nature his word his Doctrine you say Doctrine is important Doctrine it's what you believe my brother my sister is so important it will determine how you live and how you live will determine where you go eternally false Doctrine is one of the greatest threats to the True Church of Christ a it's not just some false Doctrine as brother bam said he doesn't come with something way out in the left field but false Doctrine is any SE of discrepancy any hybridizing of the word of God any opinion mixed in it any idea I wonder if we could just do a heart scan today and say Lord search me if I've added anything into this word if I've added any of my thoughts then purge them God I raised my hand and say Purge me Lord Jesus Purge my mind Purge my spirit if any of my doubts there Purge it Lord God I want to be full of faith I want to be full of life I want to be full of the Holy Ghost how many want it today I don't want there to be any seat of discrepancy any mixture of anything Lord that would take away the effect of the token for this age let me accept it let me believe Lord that when you sent up when you sent those seven angels on Mount Sunset what was it it was the headship coming back to the body it's not for us to question it's not for us to guess at or wonder at it's for us to say Lord I submit to the headship of the word I submit as a man how many men can do it I submit as a woman how many sisters can do it as a young person I'm submitting to the word the token the headship I want that holy life I want that Holy Ghost living deep down inside I want that Holy life how many just raise their hands and say Lord I want it for me for my family I want that word Christ impersonated in his own body living in flesh once again I want it Lord Jesus I want it for my home I want it for my personality you say brother Matt does he move beyond your soul he does he touches every part of you you say Lord I need more of you what what part of me every part of me I needed in my mind my body what I look at what I do what I say what I think God you want in every part of us Lord that atonement comes to cleanse us and Lord I
