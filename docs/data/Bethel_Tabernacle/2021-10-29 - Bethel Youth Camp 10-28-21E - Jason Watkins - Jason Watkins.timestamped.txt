[8:46] weekend
[8:48] amen i don't know of a time in my life
[8:52] that
[8:52] i've seen the devil fight something
[8:55] harder
[8:56] than this youth camp
[8:58] he's fought it he's had a a
[9:01] well-tailored specific i mean uh nuclear
[9:05] attack he unlaunched on our church just
[9:07] uh here youth camp was coming up and
[9:10] we've had a few covet cases here and
[9:12] there never really had an outbreak and
[9:14] man just a few weeks before camp this is
[9:16] actually beginning of october one family
[9:18] second family third family fourth family
[9:20] covet cova just a massive outbreak we're
[9:23] having to cancel church we have brother
[9:24] jason demars who goes into the hospital
[9:27] with it there was so much uncertainty
[9:29] surrounding everything and i knew it was
[9:31] just a storm an attack of the enemy
[9:34] trying to shut things down
[9:36] but somebody was praying
[9:39] and there was hearts i believe of you
[9:41] and your needs and your family and your
[9:43] parents who were praying and i believe
[9:45] that those prayers the bible says the
[9:48] the prayers of a righteous man avails
[9:50] much
[9:50] and the holy spirit moved in a
[9:52] supernatural way and the devil who
[9:55] thought he was going to put a stop to
[9:56] something about the time that everybody
[9:58] was out of quarantine and all of our
[10:00] days were over and everybody was
[10:02] recovered and brother jason comes out of
[10:04] the hospital it's camp time
[10:07] now the devil didn't design it that way
[10:09] but god knew what he was doing all along
[10:11] and not one person who was sick and and
[10:14] feeble that couldn't have come to camp
[10:16] in that condition every single one of
[10:18] them are here tonight
[10:21] you ought to give the lord a handclap of
[10:22] praise for that
[10:24] hallelujah
[10:26] amen
[10:29] glory
[10:31] so i want to let the devil know right
[10:33] now you can try you can do all you want
[10:35] you can throw all the assaults you want
[10:37] but god wins in the end
[10:39] and the devil's a loser
[10:41] somebody say he's a loser
[10:43] he's a loser and he's going to lose
[10:45] we're the winners
[10:46] amen we want to get to the song service
[10:48] we have a lot amen here tonight we want
[10:50] to get to
[10:51] but i want to just make some
[10:53] reading announcements i got to just go
[10:55] over some of these before we begin a lot
[10:58] of these you heard some of the
[10:59] counselors heard some of this you got
[11:01] through way of email uh and and
[11:04] different forms but so if these are
[11:06] repeated just make sure you listen up
[11:08] because these are real close this will
[11:10] be our camp orientation none of y'all
[11:13] have been here before and we've only
[11:15] been here a few times we took a few
[11:16] trips here scouting trips so uh i got in
[11:19] the golf cart to take a couple people uh
[11:21] today and i said where are you going and
[11:23] they said i'm at such and such and they
[11:25] and i said do you know how to get there
[11:27] and they said no i said neither do i so
[11:29] we're in trouble i had to pull out the
[11:31] map and then find out how to get there
[11:32] but we made our way so uh the property
[11:35] uh is is vast it's large uh lots of uh
[11:39] lots of it covers a lot of acres um so
[11:42] we we have some specifics and some
[11:44] things some guidelines we want you to
[11:46] follow uh while you're here at camp to
[11:49] make sure everybody has a good time
[11:51] there is um
[11:53] weather better weather predicted for
[11:55] tomorrow so we know the master of the
[11:58] wind and we're going to pray how many
[11:59] will pray say lord give us good weather
[12:01] throughout camp supposed to turn around
[12:03] and get a little bit better in the
[12:04] morning and fortunately
[12:06] we're going to have a little bit of
[12:07] sunshine i'm not really sure so
[12:09] everything that we have on the schedule
[12:11] announced is going to be barring the
[12:13] weather and then we'll we'll go as we as
[12:15] we can and play it by ear play other
[12:16] things by ear
[12:18] so i'm going to read through some of
[12:19] these um
[12:21] as we said in the emails campers aren't
[12:23] allowed to leave camp so once you're
[12:25] here you park your car unless there's an
[12:27] emergency you can't leave you got to
[12:29] stay here
[12:31] and there's a gate that locks at night
[12:32] so we want to make sure that you're here
[12:34] there's also a buddy system that they've
[12:36] put in place that we want you to follow
[12:39] i'm going to get to that here in just a
[12:40] moment
[12:41] and at lights out
[12:43] um
[12:44] security will be making rounds the
[12:46] security team will make a round to each
[12:48] dorm it lights out just to make sure
[12:51] everything's okay
[12:52] lights out will be will be given to you
[12:54] now
[12:55] if you signed up and opted in for the
[12:57] mass text that's one of our best ways of
[12:59] communication to get something to you
[13:01] fast
[13:02] lights out will be announced on that
[13:04] group text it'll be announced other ways
[13:06] your counselor get it and make sure that
[13:08] you know but lights out time is where is
[13:11] the time that we put on there i think
[13:13] was 11 30 is what's on the schedule
[13:15] depending on what the lord does in
[13:17] services depending on what will happen
[13:18] after that may change
[13:22] it's not going to get any earlier don't
[13:23] worry but that may change
[13:26] depending on service so you're going to
[13:28] want to watch out for that announcement
[13:29] that we give you concerning the lights
[13:31] out time and we'll give that out as i
[13:34] said based upon things and give you some
[13:36] heads up i want to say this because i
[13:37] didn't see this on here maybe it is on

[20:38] music you don't need to be here for that
[20:41] food allergies preferences so you can

[20:58] make sure you get that if you did not
[21:00] let us know of allergies we can

[21:10] so you got that the the the uh the
[21:12] different color bands there they that'll
[21:14] be that'll be your meal times there is
[21:16] no swapping for that no switching with
[21:18] friends um you have to go at your

[1:00:51] he took counsel with his princes and his
[1:00:53] mighty men to stop the waters of the
[1:00:55] fountains which were
[1:00:56] without the city and they did help him
[1:00:59] so there was gathered much people
[1:01:00] together who stopped all the fountains
[1:01:03] and the brook that ran through the midst
[1:01:05] of the land saying why should the kings
[1:01:08] of syria
[1:01:09] come and find much water
[1:01:12] also he strengthened himself and built
[1:01:14] up all the wall that was broken and
[1:01:18] raised it up to the towers now it's this
[1:01:21] is all really good productive stuff but
[1:01:24] there's a little bit of
[1:01:26] sadness in my mind as i read it i'm
[1:01:28] thinking you know hezekiah why did you
[1:01:32] need to quickly go and rebuild
[1:01:33] everything just because the enemy was
[1:01:35] approaching
[1:01:36] you know why why do we wait until we're
[1:01:38] in a trial to pray why why is it that we
[1:01:41] hold back and then and then we dial nine
[1:01:43] the heavenly 9-1-1
[1:01:46] and we end up treating god like a
[1:01:48] vending machine
[1:01:50] or santa claus which he's neither
[1:01:53] see
[1:01:54] so he's looking for more of a
[1:01:55] relationship with you than that and he
[1:01:58] goes on to say and he raised up to the
[1:02:01] towers and another wall without and
[1:02:03] repaired milo in the city of david and
[1:02:05] made darts and shields in abundance
[1:02:07] and he set captains of war over the
[1:02:10] people and gathered them together to him
[1:02:12] in the street of the gate of the city
[1:02:14] and spoke comfortably to them saying
[1:02:17] be strong and courageous be not afraid
[1:02:21] nor dismayed for the king of assyria
[1:02:26] let me read verse 7 again be strong and
[1:02:28] courageous be not afraid nor dismayed
[1:02:31] for the king of assyria
[1:02:33] nor for all the multitude that is with
[1:02:36] him
[1:02:36] for there be more with us than with him
[1:02:40] now considering that he had
[1:02:43] the syrian army was nearly a quarter of
[1:02:45] a million strong
[1:02:47] this isn't a numerics about humans that
[1:02:50] that hezekiah is referring to but how
[1:02:53] many know that little as much if god is
[1:02:55] in it
[1:02:55] how many know that you and jesus
[1:02:57] constitute a majority
[1:03:02] see and so he says there be more with us
[1:03:05] than with him with him now here's why
[1:03:08] with him is an arm of flesh but with us
[1:03:12] is the lord our god to help us and to
[1:03:15] fight our battles and the people rested
[1:03:18] themselves upon the words of hezekiah
[1:03:22] king of judah there's nothing to bring
[1:03:24] peace like the promise of the word
[1:03:27] you got a trouble tonight let me give
[1:03:29] you some promises of the word verse 20
[1:03:33] and for this cause
[1:03:34] hezekiah the king and the prophet isaiah
[1:03:37] the son of amos prayed and cried to
[1:03:39] heaven and the lord sent an angel which
[1:03:42] cut off all the mighty men of valor and
[1:03:44] the leaders and captains in the camp of
[1:03:46] the king of assyria so he returned with
[1:03:49] shame of faith to his own land and when
[1:03:52] he was come into the house of his god
[1:03:54] they that came forth of his own bowels
[1:03:56] these his own sons slew him there with
[1:03:59] the sword
[1:04:00] thus the lord saved hezekiah and the
[1:04:03] inhabitants of jerusalem from the hand
[1:04:06] of synacrib the king of assyria and from
[1:04:09] the hand of all other and guided them on
[1:04:12] every side
[1:04:15] father we thank you for your word this
[1:04:17] evening i pray master that you will come
[1:04:20] and anoint your word mightily lord

[1:04:34] found myself lord as i just began to
[1:04:37] look over
[1:04:38] and follow the leadership of the lord i
[1:04:40] found myself here in second chronicles i

[1:05:27] nope
[1:05:30] all right just getting used to this
[1:05:34] here
[1:05:39] how many know that god purposed you
[1:05:41] before the foundation of the world
[1:05:45] how many knows that
[1:05:47] that before there was ever stardust the
[1:05:50] word of god existed
[1:05:53] and you existed in that word the word
[1:05:55] has its predestinated
[1:05:58] effect on you
[1:05:59] and it not only affects you but it
[1:06:02] effects change in your life because it
[1:06:04] doesn't do any good to just be affected
[1:06:06] by the word you want to for the word to
[1:06:09] effect a change in your life that's why
[1:06:12] you're a christian because i'm here to
[1:06:13] tell you something friends uh i i get it
[1:06:16] that sometimes the battles can get
[1:06:19] really hot and heavy and even at even at
[1:06:22] your young age there's many of you
[1:06:24] already have surmounted tremendous uh
[1:06:27] obstacles in your life and many of you
[1:06:29] tonight could testify and say brother i
[1:06:31] had this crisis in my life or that
[1:06:33] crisis and i'd say my you're so young
[1:06:35] but the devil is no he doesn't wait till
[1:06:38] somebody gets some age on him he starts
[1:06:40] early he starts trying to derail you he
[1:06:43] comes into your childhood tries to
[1:06:45] invade your home you ought to be
[1:06:46] thankful for godly parents and pastors
[1:06:49] a man and family who will pray for you
[1:06:52] and apply a token to a home you don't
[1:06:54] you won't know until the other side how
[1:06:57] many times the angels interdicted on a
[1:07:00] move the enemy had planned for your life
[1:07:03] you got up on any morning like every
[1:07:05] other morning you got ready for school
[1:07:07] or a job or wherever you were going
[1:07:09] you're headed to the market or you're
[1:07:11] headed to see a friend or you're headed
[1:07:13] on a vacation
[1:07:14] and there were there were demon forces
[1:07:17] conspiring in a realm you couldn't see
[1:07:20] but also in that same realm there were
[1:07:23] angels moving on your
[1:07:26] behalf and you will be surprised on the
[1:07:29] other side to learn just how many times
[1:07:32] they stepped in to thwart the enemy for
[1:07:35] you
[1:07:37] we find that everything that god does is
[1:07:40] purposed
[1:07:41] and you know that he's he's not a
[1:07:44] purposeless god er jesus even said of
[1:07:46] the word of god that there's not even a
[1:07:49] word if it'll pass away
[1:07:50] that actually
[1:07:52] that that that god values his word above
[1:07:55] his name
[1:07:56] and we find that not even a jot or a
[1:07:58] tittle not one iota i mean that's you're
[1:08:01] getting down to punctuations and and
[1:08:04] even smaller than punctuations and
[1:08:06] there's not nothing in the bible that is
[1:08:08] a contradiction it's written by men over
[1:08:11] hundreds and hundreds of years all from
[1:08:14] one central mind
[1:08:17] that saw me and saw you before the world
[1:08:20] existed
[1:08:23] god has a vision of you
[1:08:25] god has been moving your entire life
[1:08:27] whether you
[1:08:29] you say well i you know i'm actually
[1:08:31] just here tonight because a friend
[1:08:32] brought me i'm not even i'm not even
[1:08:34] born again i'm here to tell you
[1:08:36] something friends if there's anything in
[1:08:37] you to respond to the word of god you
[1:08:41] existed in the mind of god and god had a
[1:08:43] plan
[1:08:46] god had a plan before you didn't know
[1:08:48] you would want it
[1:08:51] god had a plan before you decided you
[1:08:53] didn't want it
[1:08:56] i'm here to tell you that if god is
[1:08:58] determined to do something you're not
[1:09:00] going to stop him
[1:09:03] and if he is determined to track you
[1:09:05] down i'm here to tell you he will send
[1:09:07] the fisherman and if that angler can't
[1:09:09] catch you he'll send another fisherman
[1:09:11] and if that one can't catch you he'll
[1:09:12] put a change of lure and use another
[1:09:14] fisherman but understand finally if a
[1:09:17] fisherman can't get you he will send the
[1:09:19] hunter
[1:09:23] now hunter don't miss
[1:09:24] the holy ghost gets his man or his woman
[1:09:28] he's not he's not going to let the enemy
[1:09:30] take one of his offspring from his
[1:09:33] possession
[1:09:35] my advice to you tonight would be
[1:09:37] surrender
[1:09:39] my advice to you tonight now is just
[1:09:42] throw up your hands and say lord i
[1:09:44] surrender right now
[1:09:46] i remember yeah somebody said one time
[1:09:49] that a a preacher and a lawyer had went
[1:09:52] to church and they were both as world as
[1:09:54] could be in their buddies
[1:09:55] and my goodness the sermon got going and
[1:09:58] they both fell under conviction and they
[1:09:59] hit the old sawdust trail and they fell
[1:10:02] at the altar
[1:10:04] and my goodness that doctor he rolled
[1:10:07] around and he screamed out four or five
[1:10:09] minutes and jumped to his feet and
[1:10:10] thrust both hands in the air and said
[1:10:12] i'm free
[1:10:14] i'm free and that lawyer just you know
[1:10:17] he looked at that he went back to
[1:10:19] praying and he prayed for an hour and
[1:10:21] two hours and they beat him on the back
[1:10:23] and they
[1:10:24] they they caught on the name of the lord
[1:10:26] and finally after about three hours of
[1:10:27] rolling around in the sawdust he jumped
[1:10:30] to his feet under the power of god and
[1:10:31] he said i'm free hallelujah they're
[1:10:34] walking home
[1:10:37] and the
[1:10:38] the lawyer says the doctor says hey bud
[1:10:39] i'll ask you a question sure
[1:10:41] sure but go ahead what is it he said
[1:10:43] isn't god good oh yeah he's good good
[1:10:45] old time oh all the time said i'm so
[1:10:47] glad he what he did for us tonight yes
[1:10:49] isn't it wonderful he said doc he said
[1:10:51] there's one thing i don't understand he
[1:10:52] said what is it pal
[1:10:54] he said you know he said when you got
[1:10:56] down in five minutes you jumped up full
[1:10:58] of the spirit of god
[1:11:00] he said for me i had to stay down there
[1:11:02] two or three hours
[1:11:03] and he said i don't understand that and
[1:11:04] the doctor laughed and he said oh that's
[1:11:06] easy he said that's just because i'm a
[1:11:08] doctor and you're a lawyer
[1:11:11] and he said well what's that got to do
[1:11:12] with it he said well when you got down
[1:11:14] there you started pleading your case i
[1:11:16] just told him i'm guilty
[1:11:19] don't plead your case friend just raise
[1:11:22] up the hand and say i'm guilty lord
[1:11:24] and i need your help
[1:11:29] six thousand years of
[1:11:31] the histories of mankind
[1:11:34] has made it difficult if if not
[1:11:37] impossible for him to accept or really
[1:11:40] even even perceive that the word truly
[1:11:44] um
[1:11:45] you know is in control of everything
[1:11:48] that the word of god is controlling
[1:11:50] everything now i i could take a whole
[1:11:52] sermon which i love doing and and
[1:11:54] correlating history to prophecy because
[1:11:56] you can see that all of the pro all of
[1:11:58] the history day you're living in is
[1:12:00] being controlled by prophecy don't ever
[1:12:02] let anyone tell you that politics are
[1:12:04] controlling it or the white house or the
[1:12:06] vatican or the kremlin they're not in
[1:12:08] control of anything they're puppets
[1:12:11] prophecy is controlling the world
[1:12:14] and it's hard for man to perceive that
[1:12:17] the world after 6 000 years of his
[1:12:20] histories is truly coming to a major
[1:12:23] upheaval
[1:12:25] of everything he has understood since
[1:12:28] the fall in the garden
[1:12:30] since that faithful day
[1:12:33] 6 000 years ago mankind has basically
[1:12:36] had to make his own way in the world
[1:12:39] through trial and error through
[1:12:41] successes and failures through ups and
[1:12:44] downs and sometimes just dumb luck
[1:12:46] or not
[1:12:49] for fallen man to be able to grasp and
[1:12:52] to be able to
[1:12:54] come to terms with the fact that the
[1:12:56] whole thing the whole thing all the
[1:12:58] histories all the events
[1:13:01] of history
[1:13:03] have been a grand production
[1:13:06] that is being accomplished by god to
[1:13:10] fulfill his purposes and his goals
[1:13:16] time itself is a creation of god set in
[1:13:19] motion
[1:13:21] to achieve an eternal purpose think of
[1:13:23] the irony of that god set time in motion
[1:13:26] to achieve an eternal purpose
[1:13:29] moreover for him for fallen man to now
[1:13:32] realize
[1:13:34] the fact that the purposes of god
[1:13:37] are being finished up
[1:13:40] right here in the day and hour in real
[1:13:43] time this is happening in real time
[1:13:46] this isn't a joke this is serious
[1:13:49] the world is like a garment that's waxed
[1:13:52] old and it's ready for renewal
[1:13:56] they can cry all they want to and i'm
[1:13:58] not here to argue the science of the
[1:13:59] politics it's all of the devil anyway
[1:14:02] but i i know what's going on if the
[1:14:04] world's got a global warming and the
[1:14:06] world's all kinds of trouble i know
[1:14:08] exactly what it is it's the earth knows
[1:14:10] it's about the transition and the earth
[1:14:12] is already going ahead and making
[1:14:14] changes
[1:14:15] [Applause]
[1:14:17] say meyer polar caps are melting you
[1:14:19] ain't seen nothing yet honey
[1:14:21] they're going away completely
[1:14:23] even the deserts are going to blossom
[1:14:25] like a rose
[1:14:26] hallelujah oh i'm gonna tell you
[1:14:28] something friends our retirement plan is
[1:14:30] out of this world
[1:14:35] the world as he has known it has fallen
[1:14:38] mankind humanity
[1:14:41] the world as humanity has known it is
[1:14:43] approaching its end game there are in
[1:14:46] fact even as we speak tonight
[1:14:48] catastrophic judgments that are rushing
[1:14:50] to meet us
[1:14:52] and i'm here to tell you the only way
[1:14:54] out is up
[1:14:57] hear me again tonight friends there are
[1:14:59] catastrophic judgments rushing to meet
[1:15:02] this world and the only way out is up
[1:15:06] i want to go up
[1:15:09] hallelujah
[1:15:12] the principle is
[1:15:14] that whatever is not eternal
[1:15:17] must pass away
[1:15:19] however long it may have survived now by
[1:15:23] all human odds and i get it i get why
[1:15:26] it's a struggle for fallen man to get
[1:15:28] his mind wrapped around what we're
[1:15:30] saying tonight by all human odds it
[1:15:32] should continue just as it always has
[1:15:35] just as it always does
[1:15:39] but against but odds against a principle
[1:15:43] are no match
[1:15:45] i don't care what the odds are
[1:15:48] the principles of god's word will
[1:15:51] prevail
[1:15:53] you should just take that and and speak
[1:15:56] peace into your own life tonight i don't
[1:15:58] care what the odds look might be stacked
[1:16:00] against you but if your life is based on
[1:16:03] the principles of god's word you have to
[1:16:05] win
[1:16:07] you can't lose
[1:16:09] see satan could actually win if he
[1:16:12] wasn't if it wasn't for always losing he
[1:16:14] could actually win but he can't win for
[1:16:16] losing
[1:16:17] and so we find that this 6 000 year epic
[1:16:21] drama
[1:16:22] has been and i say this unapologetically
[1:16:26] unequivocally it has been perfectly not
[1:16:29] partially it has been perfectly
[1:16:31] controlled it has been perfectly purpose
[1:16:35] driven by the only source of eternal
[1:16:38] existence and life itself and that is
[1:16:43] god
[1:16:44] that's it there's no other answer god is
[1:16:48] in control of everything he's not only
[1:16:51] the god of good men he's the god of all
[1:16:54] men
[1:16:55] he's not only the god of the good he he
[1:16:58] he puts rings in the nose of emperors
[1:17:01] and kings and leads them to his will i'm
[1:17:04] here to tell you something friends you
[1:17:05] don't have to you don't have to abide in
[1:17:07] the spirit of fear that's on this age
[1:17:09] you've been given a different spirit
[1:17:12] you've been given an ability to receive
[1:17:14] the word of god and receive the life
[1:17:17] that comes out of that word
[1:17:20] god alone
[1:17:22] man's six thousand year reign in a
[1:17:24] fallen condition is now fulfilling its
[1:17:26] final purpose
[1:17:28] and it's time to move on
[1:17:33] there is i think when we look at our
[1:17:36] text in ii chronicles where
[1:17:38] i believe that any of us as believers
[1:17:40] would believe tonight that there is an
[1:17:42] incomparable difference really
[1:17:46] in trusting in the in the lord
[1:17:48] versus trusting in the arm of flesh
[1:17:53] they're so far apart they're not even
[1:17:55] comparable i would love to use one as a
[1:17:57] contrast but they're just too far apart
[1:18:00] when you
[1:18:01] are going to trust the lord
[1:18:03] you that is a mutually exclusive term
[1:18:06] you're not trusting the lord and
[1:18:07] trusting the arm of flesh at the same
[1:18:09] time
[1:18:10] perfect faith and perfect fear are
[1:18:13] mutually exclusive terms they can't both
[1:18:16] be true at the same time in a believer
[1:18:20] we have come to the age of perfect faith
[1:18:22] in a time of perfect fear and it's
[1:18:24] gripping the world but god has given you
[1:18:27] something better god has given you a
[1:18:30] peace and a faith and a belief that that
[1:18:33] god is in control of it all
[1:18:38] the king of assyria found this out the
[1:18:40] hard way
[1:18:43] this fallen world offers many challenges
[1:18:45] many challenges would you agree
[1:18:48] many trials
[1:18:50] many afflictions jesus never
[1:18:53] promised us it would be
[1:18:55] easy
[1:18:57] only that it would be worth it
[1:19:00] i want to tell you something today young
[1:19:02] man young woman it will be worth it
[1:19:06] oh will it be worth it
[1:19:10] job would
[1:19:11] make the comment and say that a man born
[1:19:14] of a woman
[1:19:15] he's just a few days and he's
[1:19:18] full of trouble
[1:19:21] and you know
[1:19:22] why
[1:19:23] i think it's a fair question
[1:19:26] why is trusting in the lord such an
[1:19:28] advantage
[1:19:29] over the arm of flesh
[1:19:32] and and there are many things that i
[1:19:34] could say on that tonight i just want to
[1:19:36] angle into one particular side of this
[1:19:38] mountain that be all right
[1:19:40] what is trusting in the lord why is it
[1:19:43] such an advantage
[1:19:45] over the arm of flesh
[1:19:47] because for one thing
[1:19:49] flesh looks forward trying hard to bring
[1:19:53] things to pass
[1:19:54] but those who put their trust in the
[1:19:56] lord know that the lord has accomplished
[1:19:59] it already
[1:20:02] so you can take the arm of flesh and you
[1:20:04] can try to make a life out of this out
[1:20:07] of this few days and full of trouble
[1:20:08] good luck with that i'll put my trust in
[1:20:11] the lord who has already sealed every
[1:20:14] divine promise
[1:20:16] it's already accomplished for me
[1:20:21] anything you will ever need from the
[1:20:23] cradle to the grave i got a message for
[1:20:26] you it's already done
[1:20:29] everything brother brannon would say
[1:20:30] everything that you have need of for a
[1:20:33] rapture
[1:20:34] is in
[1:20:36] you
[1:20:37] now
[1:20:38] not coming it's now
[1:20:40] whether you're born again or not if a
[1:20:42] gene of god is in there for a new birth
[1:20:44] that's in you now
[1:20:46] you don't come to an altar and become a
[1:20:48] son or daughter of god you find out you
[1:20:50] always were and now by the baptism of
[1:20:53] the holy ghost you're able you're now
[1:20:55] free to cooperate in the vision
[1:20:58] that god had a view god had a vision of
[1:21:02] you
[1:21:04] bible says that even when jesus was
[1:21:07] suffering on the cross he would see a
[1:21:08] seed and be satisfied
[1:21:12] everything you have need of
[1:21:15] god has done it already
[1:21:18] you know i saw an interesting interview
[1:21:22] they interviewed a nasa engineer quite a
[1:21:24] number of them when they were
[1:21:26] making the mars rover and
[1:21:29] they had a very wonderful celebration
[1:21:31] because they successfully
[1:21:32] landed the rover on mars and it's
[1:21:35] operational and sending back pictures
[1:21:37] and they've even got a little drone that
[1:21:39] they had to build especially has to be
[1:21:41] computer driven nobody can the
[1:21:43] atmosphere so light and and and all
[1:21:46] there was so many so many possibilities
[1:21:48] for it to go wrong it was quite a feat
[1:21:51] of human engineering ingenuity and
[1:21:53] engineering
[1:21:54] and this nasa engineer when he's being
[1:21:57] interviewed he he starts talking they
[1:22:00] say you know where were you nervous
[1:22:03] and he says
[1:22:04] that's that's that's an understatement
[1:22:06] he said
[1:22:08] that this is the culmination of years
[1:22:11] of years more than a decade of the
[1:22:14] greatest minds gathering over year after
[1:22:17] year after year after year for a landing
[1:22:20] that's going to be over in about a
[1:22:23] minute
[1:22:24] and all of this effort has been poured
[1:22:27] into that when that thing comes down the
[1:22:30] retro rockets will fire the separation
[1:22:32] will happen the parachute will deploy
[1:22:33] the feet will come down and everything
[1:22:35] will happen synchronously and it'll have
[1:22:37] a touchdown and it won't break
[1:22:40] and it'll be operational
[1:22:43] and everything will work and this is
[1:22:45] years and years of our lives invested in
[1:22:49] a few terrifying minutes
[1:22:52] and that thing's falling i forget how
[1:22:54] many hundred miles an hour
[1:22:56] toward mars
[1:22:58] and he actually as he as he was telling
[1:23:01] the story
[1:23:02] he was literally sweating telling it
[1:23:05] and the interviewer even even said to
[1:23:07] him said you're sweating now just
[1:23:09] telling the story he grabbed a
[1:23:10] handkerchief he goes you're right man
[1:23:12] i'm reliving it all over again because
[1:23:15] he he had to sweat it out and and he
[1:23:17] said he said because you you've got to
[1:23:19] realize he said
[1:23:22] at some point he said and i don't
[1:23:24] remember exactly why but he said
[1:23:25] communication goes dark and we're in the
[1:23:28] dark
[1:23:28] we know nothing all we know is we're
[1:23:31] descending and that's it and and it
[1:23:34] doesn't come back around and we don't
[1:23:36] get a video feed and we don't know what
[1:23:38] happened until the rotation comes around
[1:23:41] and the video feed hits the earth again
[1:23:42] it takes minutes to get here and when it
[1:23:44] comes on the screen we will know if we
[1:23:46] have disaster or if we have triumphed
[1:23:49] and they had triumphed when it came back
[1:23:51] on you've just seen my goodness i didn't
[1:23:53] know scientists could jump like that and
[1:23:54] they were screaming and hollering and
[1:23:56] running all over the place and hugging
[1:23:57] one another and crying
[1:23:59] and
[1:23:59] and and he said he said listen he said
[1:24:01] you don't realize the agony
[1:24:03] because that knowing whatever was going
[1:24:07] to happen
[1:24:08] had already happened
[1:24:13] and we're sitting there
[1:24:15] and there's i mean we're anxious but
[1:24:18] what's the point
[1:24:19] because at this point whatever has
[1:24:22] happened has already happened
[1:24:25] and and we find out that he he could
[1:24:27] only wait for the outcome to declare
[1:24:30] itself when the video feed made it back
[1:24:32] to the earth over many many agonizing
[1:24:35] minutes
[1:24:36] i want you to think through this with me
[1:24:39] he could wait in hope
[1:24:41] but wishing wouldn't make it so
[1:24:44] he could have some measure of human
[1:24:46] faith
[1:24:47] i mean i'll give him that based on
[1:24:49] meticulous preparation and engineering
[1:24:52] that it went into the whole thing
[1:24:54] but but these would be very little
[1:24:57] comfort while he waited it out while he
[1:25:00] sweated it out there was no if you think
[1:25:02] about it friends there was no peace even
[1:25:05] possible
[1:25:06] until he could see
[1:25:08] physically see the mystery revealed
[1:25:13] there's no way
[1:25:15] see he couldn't have he actually had to
[1:25:17] wait to get peace he had to wait to see
[1:25:21] it
[1:25:23] while he can't see it he's in agony
[1:25:25] while he can't see it he knows
[1:25:26] whatever's happened has already happened
[1:25:28] and it's just going to be what it's
[1:25:30] going to be and when the screen comes on
[1:25:32] either we've succeeded or we failed and
[1:25:34] that's it
[1:25:36] there's nothing i can do i can hope upon
[1:25:38] a star wish upon a star count my lucky
[1:25:41] stars but wishing isn't going to change
[1:25:43] anything
[1:25:46] and even the faith i've got is only a
[1:25:48] little bit of human faith based on all
[1:25:50] the work that we put in it all of his
[1:25:53] human hope and all of his human faith
[1:25:56] were made moot by the reality of what
[1:25:59] already existed
[1:26:03] he can only wait anxiously
[1:26:06] to see what the unalterable outcome
[1:26:09] would turn out to be
[1:26:11] all that could be done to help the
[1:26:13] situation had already been done during
[1:26:16] the time of construction and programming
[1:26:20] this
[1:26:21] i want to say to you tonight friends
[1:26:23] this when you're leaning on the arm of
[1:26:26] flesh
[1:26:27] this is the best life can offer you when
[1:26:32] you lean on the arm of flesh all you can
[1:26:35] do is give it your old notre dame try
[1:26:37] and hope for the best but i'm here to
[1:26:39] tell you there's a better way
[1:26:42] there's a better way than the arm of
[1:26:44] flesh
[1:26:47] i feel sorry for mankind who won't trust
[1:26:50] god i feel sorry for mankind who leans
[1:26:52] on the arm of flesh i feel sorry for
[1:26:55] them and that's why the bible says in
[1:26:56] this last day men's heart would fail for
[1:26:59] fear now you know when i know there is
[1:27:02] no greater fear for a human than the
[1:27:04] fear of the unknown that's why you won't
[1:27:06] go in a dark room without turning light
[1:27:08] on that's why you're walking in a dark
[1:27:10] alley you hear a sound you're creeped
[1:27:12] out
[1:27:12] why because you don't know what it is i
[1:27:15] can't see oh what a way that's that and
[1:27:18] and that is the greatest fear and man's
[1:27:20] heart is failing for fear of the unknown
[1:27:23] and here we are tonight with the open
[1:27:25] book and the full mind of god revealed
[1:27:29] you are such a privileged people you're
[1:27:32] so privileged my brother my sister don't
[1:27:34] take what god has done in this hour
[1:27:37] lightly
[1:27:41] hallelujah
[1:27:42] this is the best life can offer you when
[1:27:45] you lean on the arm of flesh but my eyes
[1:27:49] see a different reality i'm looking to a
[1:27:52] preparation from back in the eternities
[1:27:55] i'm looking for something that happened
[1:27:58] before creation was created
[1:28:01] hallelujah
[1:28:03] all the construction and labor on my
[1:28:06] behalf
[1:28:07] that happened
[1:28:09] before i got here
[1:28:12] but before anything got here
[1:28:15] before anything got here listen friend
[1:28:18] before stardust got here before stardust
[1:28:21] got here god had a purpose for my life
[1:28:25] so i've had all kinds of failures yeah
[1:28:27] but i was purpose before i got here to
[1:28:29] fail
[1:28:31] hallelujah one of these days friends
[1:28:33] you're going to realize that nothing
[1:28:35] trumps that gene of god in you you're
[1:28:37] going to realize that there is now
[1:28:38] therefore no condemnation to them which
[1:28:41] are in christ you're going to take your
[1:28:42] failures and you're going to throw them
[1:28:44] back at the devil and you're going to
[1:28:45] say it don't matter
[1:28:48] it don't matter and you don't matter
[1:28:51] satan
[1:28:52] i am a believer in the word of god
[1:28:56] i have given my heart and my life to
[1:28:58] christ
[1:29:03] it's not a hope or a faith that it will
[1:29:06] happen
[1:29:07] or neither is it a doubt that it won't
[1:29:09] happen
[1:29:10] hope has no voice in this
[1:29:14] that's why brother brandon would say
[1:29:16] hope is the worst enemy faith has
[1:29:18] see and so hope has no voice in this i'm
[1:29:21] looking at a promise that what he said
[1:29:24] he'd do he's already done it
[1:29:28] so how do you know because an open book
[1:29:30] is calling my name oh and i'm here to
[1:29:32] tell you something it seems to be a name
[1:29:34] it already knew
[1:29:35] hallelujah
[1:29:40] calling you calling me
[1:29:43] i know it called me because i hear the
[1:29:44] gospel trumpet
[1:29:47] draws me to this feast of the word i'm
[1:29:49] going to tell you something friends this
[1:29:50] is beyond me this is beyond a decision
[1:29:52] this is beyond me or you choosing
[1:29:56] this is someone
[1:29:58] that's already chosen me
[1:30:01] when the eagle flies over that gene
[1:30:05] brother branham said and eat when that
[1:30:06] eagle when that light flashes on that
[1:30:08] seed he said it'll come to life just as
[1:30:11] sure as anything i'm here to tell you
[1:30:13] something friends i found out that that
[1:30:16] there's a there's another being living
[1:30:17] inside me there's a better me than me
[1:30:20] i'm here to tell you tonight there's a
[1:30:22] you have access to a better you than you
[1:30:25] hallelujah there's there's an alien
[1:30:27] force inside me and it and it echoes
[1:30:30] from within me it it doesn't decide to
[1:30:32] believe god's word it echoes amen amen
[1:30:37] amen there's no decision there's no hope
[1:30:40] i'm not wondering i'm not trying to
[1:30:42] figure it out there's an alien voice
[1:30:44] inside me that says amen to every word
[1:30:47] of god
[1:30:52] how did it all happen brother jason all
[1:30:54] i know is that somewhere in the
[1:30:56] eternities morning stars sang together
[1:30:59] and sons of god shouted for joy
[1:31:01] and i was part of that group say how do
[1:31:03] you know because now that i hear the
[1:31:05] word i got the same shout for joy that
[1:31:08] they had when they heard the word
[1:31:11] they stood there and heard the word of
[1:31:12] god and they shouted for joy
[1:31:19] we know that the bible talks about a
[1:31:21] great falling away at the end time
[1:31:25] now i want to
[1:31:27] dig a little deeper you good
[1:31:32] i wanna i wanna i wanna
[1:31:35] change my angle and dive a little deeper
[1:31:37] all right
[1:31:39] so when we think about
[1:31:42] the falling away
[1:31:45] that is to come at the end time
[1:31:48] we find too often times that
[1:31:51] what we are faced with and i know this
[1:31:53] authoritatively because i was
[1:31:55] raised in this message born into it my
[1:31:57] parents
[1:31:58] uh were in the meetings of brother
[1:32:00] branham i was a baby sitting there i was
[1:32:02] prayed for him healed of an incurable
[1:32:03] blood disease by proxy my dad's standing
[1:32:06] in a prayer line and me hundreds of
[1:32:07] miles away and the very instant it was
[1:32:09] pronounced that instant i was healed see
[1:32:12] so
[1:32:13] the time continuum isn't exactly what
[1:32:15] you think it is
[1:32:17] miles meant nothing
[1:32:19] when god spoke to a prophet
[1:32:23] but we find too
[1:32:24] often are retreating from the ancient
[1:32:27] landmarks of the word
[1:32:30] now don't get quiet on me because i'm
[1:32:32] here to tell you brother jason i've seen
[1:32:34] this
[1:32:35] i've seen it from a boy growing up i've
[1:32:37] seen the old ways began to be uh drifted
[1:32:40] away from
[1:32:42] and you say oh is that but wait a minute
[1:32:43] the great falling away that's happening
[1:32:45] in the world yeah that's fine what has
[1:32:47] that got to do with you and me i'm
[1:32:48] talking to you and me tonight i'm
[1:32:50] talking to sons and daughters of god i'm
[1:32:52] talking to believers and i'm here to
[1:32:54] tell you something that there's been a
[1:32:55] retreating from the ancient landmarks of
[1:32:57] the word and as a minister i want to i
[1:33:00] feel sometimes i want to say get back in
[1:33:02] step
[1:33:03] get back in line this is no time to be
[1:33:06] retreating from the ancient landmarks
[1:33:10] this is no time to water down the gospel
[1:33:13] with its transforming power if you want
[1:33:15] the transforming power of the gospel you
[1:33:17] take it like it is
[1:33:19] you take it straight you don't mix it
[1:33:22] you don't water it down you don't
[1:33:23] reconnect
[1:33:26] take it straight
[1:33:28] hallelujah
[1:33:31] too much diminishing
[1:33:34] a diminishing appreciation for the power
[1:33:37] of god
[1:33:38] bringing many sons to glory i'm here to
[1:33:40] declare that his word is unchanging
[1:33:44] i'm here as his officer tonight to make
[1:33:47] a declaration his word is unchanging
[1:33:50] it's just as powerful today as it ever
[1:33:52] was it still saves it still fills with
[1:33:55] the spirit of god it can still clean up
[1:33:57] your life it can still make the devil
[1:34:00] run from you
[1:34:04] hallelujah
[1:34:06] it's unchanging
[1:34:08] there is still power in the blood
[1:34:11] there is still a holy ghost experience
[1:34:13] to be had and i'm not going to stand by
[1:34:16] and let preachers water that idea down
[1:34:19] as if you just make some mental decision
[1:34:21] or you're raising a message family or
[1:34:23] raising a message church nothing
[1:34:26] that when we leave here my church is
[1:34:28] going to burn under nuclear fire but it
[1:34:31] won't have anyone in there when it
[1:34:33] happens
[1:34:34] that's why i preach
[1:34:36] i'm not trying to get my building in a
[1:34:38] rapture i'm not trying to get my ipad in
[1:34:41] a rapture i'm trying to get you and me
[1:34:44] in a rapture hallelujah
[1:34:52] i'd like to just break into that tonight
[1:34:54] on the very first night how many would
[1:34:57] say let's just break right into it
[1:34:59] tonight hallelujah that way when brother
[1:35:01] burley comes or brother john comes they
[1:35:03] don't have to drop back and hit these
[1:35:04] kind of things because we're already
[1:35:06] filled with the spirit of god we already
[1:35:08] got a church full of believers how many
[1:35:10] believers we've got in here tonight
[1:35:12] hallelujah
[1:35:17] satan knows he's very much aware
[1:35:21] that there are no contradictions in the
[1:35:23] scripture
[1:35:26] but it's not the scripture he fears
[1:35:29] that's true that's right all right
[1:35:32] brother branham holding up his own bible
[1:35:34] declared this is not the gospel
[1:35:37] the bible
[1:35:39] living in you
[1:35:41] that's what the holy ghost was given for
[1:35:44] it didn't come to increase your theology
[1:35:47] to give you better understanding over
[1:35:48] the baptist and methodist you do have
[1:35:50] better theology than them but that's not
[1:35:52] the point
[1:35:53] the point is that this thing is to
[1:35:55] become a living reality
[1:35:57] living behind mortal people living with
[1:35:59] all of our wrinkles and warts and ups
[1:36:01] and downs and weaknesses say you got
[1:36:03] them i got them you got them you got
[1:36:04] them we all got them we're all in this
[1:36:06] thing together
[1:36:07] hallelujah but i'm here to tell you
[1:36:10] we've got a heavenly father that knows
[1:36:12] who knows our weaknesses and knows how
[1:36:14] we're made knows and watched us in our
[1:36:17] molding and i'm here to tell you i don't
[1:36:18] care what you think about how you got
[1:36:20] here or what it is that's made up your
[1:36:22] life i want to go back and remind you
[1:36:24] that every step of a son and daughter of
[1:36:26] god whether it's before they be became
[1:36:29] born again or after is ordered of the
[1:36:31] lord
[1:36:33] and god is in control of your life say
[1:36:35] but i made all kinds of decisions and he
[1:36:37] let you because now he can redeem you
[1:36:40] and i'm going to tell you something a
[1:36:41] child of god who has come out of sin is
[1:36:44] a very valuable
[1:36:47] instrument
[1:36:48] in the hands of god
[1:36:51] satan knows there are no contradictions
[1:36:53] in the scripture
[1:36:55] so he moves to the spot
[1:36:58] where the connection is
[1:37:01] that transmits the written word or the
[1:37:03] spoken word
[1:37:04] into your heart and that's the mind
[1:37:08] and brother branham said that's the
[1:37:09] battleground that god
[1:37:12] and satan chose
[1:37:15] the mind of man
[1:37:17] because it's got to come here first and
[1:37:19] that's where satan is going to attack
[1:37:21] you with reasoning this is where satan
[1:37:25] is going to use your your five flesh
[1:37:28] body senses your your eyesight your ears
[1:37:31] your taste the things you put your hand
[1:37:33] to
[1:37:34] and he's going to use that as inlets to
[1:37:36] get to your memory and your reasoning
[1:37:38] your conscience your affection your
[1:37:39] imagination which are all in a fallen
[1:37:41] condition
[1:37:43] they're all in a falling condition none
[1:37:44] of them are none of those 10 are
[1:37:46] converted
[1:37:47] there's only one area of conversion and
[1:37:49] that's in the soul
[1:37:51] and that brother ram said that only has
[1:37:52] one sense either faith or doubt either
[1:37:54] you're born again or you're not
[1:37:56] you're not halfway born again there's no
[1:37:57] such thing
[1:37:58] you're either born of the spirit of god
[1:37:59] or you're not
[1:38:01] i understand growth and maturity but
[1:38:02] you're either born of the spirit of god
[1:38:04] or you're not
[1:38:06] and don't fool yourself thinking you are
[1:38:07] the devil would love to have you
[1:38:09] thinking you are when you're not
[1:38:11] and when you actually are born again he
[1:38:12] would love to make you think you're not
[1:38:14] born again he's a master of psychology
[1:38:18] don't don't fight him there and don't
[1:38:20] don't give i'm here to tell you
[1:38:22] something friends if you want the if you
[1:38:24] want a secret to the supernatural is
[1:38:27] keep your mind clear of laodicea's
[1:38:30] influence
[1:38:31] keep your mind stayed on the word of god
[1:38:34] feed on the word of god stop feeding on
[1:38:36] laodicea stop stop indulging in those
[1:38:38] things they're poison they're toxins
[1:38:44] and what he does is he comes to your
[1:38:47] mind
[1:38:49] because he knows there's no
[1:38:50] contradictions in the written bible
[1:38:53] so what he does is he comes to the spot
[1:38:56] where the connection is that leads from
[1:38:59] the written word to the living word
[1:39:02] and it's then lived behind human skin
[1:39:05] and he's not trying to make the bible a
[1:39:08] contradiction he's trying to make you a
[1:39:10] contradiction
[1:39:12] he's trying to fill your life with
[1:39:14] contradiction he's trying to give you
[1:39:16] the fashions of the world he's trying to
[1:39:18] give you all the popularity he's trying
[1:39:20] to get you to be one of the cool kids
[1:39:22] i'm here to tell you those kind of kids
[1:39:24] are lit up in a tribulation period i
[1:39:26] want to i don't want to be one of them i
[1:39:28] want to be the one who goes into glory
[1:39:30] with god
[1:39:31] [Applause]
[1:39:34] but understand how crafty he is
[1:39:38] he uses the things you listen to
[1:39:41] the things you gaze at because he knows
[1:39:42] the principle of the word better than
[1:39:44] you do he knows that we're tr changed
[1:39:46] into the things we gaze at
[1:39:48] that's that's a principle remember
[1:39:50] odds against a principle are no match
[1:39:53] say well
[1:39:54] i've been a believer all my life and
[1:39:57] odds are i'll stay i'll stay victorious
[1:40:00] not if you start violating the
[1:40:01] principles of god you want
[1:40:04] see
[1:40:06] so he's trying to create a contradiction
[1:40:10] between the word written in the bible
[1:40:12] and the word that's manifested in your
[1:40:14] life you know if you think about what a
[1:40:17] contradiction this
[1:40:19] of youtube and and and that that iconic
[1:40:22] phrase do you
[1:40:25] wow just do you
[1:40:27] i'm not i'm not here preaching against
[1:40:29] selfies and youtube and
[1:40:30] and slogans that's not even what i'm i'm
[1:40:32] talking about
[1:40:34] uh but what i what i'm trying to get you
[1:40:35] to see the work of the enemy
[1:40:38] when you think about selfies when you
[1:40:40] think about
[1:40:41] youtube when you think about do you
[1:40:45] i mean how opposite is that to the path
[1:40:49] that christ took he made of himself of
[1:40:52] no reputation and took upon him the form
[1:40:54] of a servant and was made in the
[1:40:56] likeness of men and being found in
[1:40:57] fashion as a man he humbled himself and
[1:40:59] became obedient unto death even the
[1:41:02] death of the cross
[1:41:04] so i want to i want to
[1:41:06] make you aware of something i want to
[1:41:09] make you aware of this angle
[1:41:11] that the falling away at the end time
[1:41:14] is far more than just some people moving
[1:41:18] away from or abandoning truth in
[1:41:21] doctrine falling away at the end time is
[1:41:25] anything that moves you away from christ
[1:41:28] being first in every aspect of your life
[1:41:32] if he's not first in every aspect of
[1:41:34] your life you've already experienced a
[1:41:36] falling away
[1:41:38] though you might still be perfectly
[1:41:40] convinced of the teachings
[1:41:42] see
[1:41:44] it's not just about abandoning doctrine
[1:41:46] when he's not your highest thought and
[1:41:48] goal
[1:41:48] when he's not the center of everything
[1:41:50] you do you have fallen away so quite
[1:41:53] naturally
[1:41:54] quite naturally then the age of youtube
[1:41:57] and selfie and do you would would
[1:42:00] naturally be the opposite it would be
[1:42:02] the antithesis of having him first in
[1:42:05] your life
[1:42:07] it's real simple
[1:42:09] it's not complicated
[1:42:11] many people you know we'll
[1:42:14] we'll say to me tonight brother jason
[1:42:16] you know that's that's not my motive in
[1:42:18] watching youtube that's not my motive
[1:42:20] when i took a selfie that's not my
[1:42:21] motive when i said to my friend hey do
[1:42:24] you have a good time go have fun that
[1:42:26] wasn't my motive and and you know what i
[1:42:28] want to say friends that that that's
[1:42:30] fine i'm not indicting you this is about
[1:42:33] the spirit that's on the age and the
[1:42:35] motive and objective for satan of satan
[1:42:38] for your life it might not be your
[1:42:41] motive
[1:42:42] but i'm here to promise you it's his
[1:42:44] motive
[1:42:45] it's his motive to corrupt you it's his
[1:42:48] motive to poison you and and and we when
[1:42:51] we think about it in the simplest terms
[1:42:53] i can just ask you tonight just just
[1:42:55] think with me just answer this to
[1:42:57] yourself i don't need anybody to raise
[1:42:59] their hand or stand up or say yeah it's
[1:43:01] me i don't need you to say amen i just
[1:43:03] want you to think about a question
[1:43:06] go down your life your everyday walking
[1:43:08] talking life
[1:43:10] your everyday 24-hour life
[1:43:13] and just ask yourself one simple
[1:43:15] question is christ
[1:43:17] and his word
[1:43:19] first in every facet of my current life
[1:43:26] if you can identify
[1:43:29] any area of your life that he is not
[1:43:32] then that is a portion
[1:43:35] that you have allowed the god of this
[1:43:37] evil age to find a way into you
[1:43:41] and he's keeping you from being a better
[1:43:44] you
[1:43:46] god has a plan to make a better you than
[1:43:49] you
[1:43:51] and satan has just the opposite plan in
[1:43:54] mind it may not be as i said whether
[1:43:57] you're aware of it or not it might not
[1:43:58] be your motive it might not be your
[1:44:00] objective but it certainly is his
[1:44:02] objective and he's found room in you to
[1:44:06] work now you sit there young people
[1:44:07] listen think about that now
[1:44:10] i want you to really take measure of
[1:44:12] that in every one of you individually
[1:44:13] i'm looking at you right in the eye take
[1:44:15] measure of that
[1:44:16] is there anywhere in your life think now
[1:44:19] that you would have to be honest and say
[1:44:21] lord the truth is
[1:44:24] you're not first you're second but
[1:44:26] brother branham said he don't want
[1:44:28] second
[1:44:30] he don't want to be second he wants to
[1:44:33] be first
[1:44:35] i want him to be first
[1:44:38] remember friends that satan brother man
[1:44:40] taught us satan is almost powerless
[1:44:42] unless he can find somebody to work
[1:44:43] through so if he's working through you
[1:44:46] maybe in some unrecognized way then then
[1:44:49] this then let me ask you now let me ask
[1:44:51] you a question what kind of damage
[1:44:53] might you be doing
[1:44:55] to those associated around you people
[1:44:57] you care about people you love
[1:45:01] because you have allowed the enemy to
[1:45:03] come and creep in and take some oh i go
[1:45:06] to church oh i go multiple times a week
[1:45:08] i read my bible but i i ask you was
[1:45:10] there any area i'm here to tell you
[1:45:13] something friends jesus paid a price
[1:45:14] that makes him worthy to be first in
[1:45:17] every aspect of your life
[1:45:21] that's what the holy ghost
[1:45:23] is given for that's why
[1:45:26] and you know i want to say this the holy
[1:45:27] ghost and and my i have just
[1:45:31] it's uh it's such a burden on my heart
[1:45:34] over the years
[1:45:36] where i've seen the baptism of the holy
[1:45:38] ghost preached in such a way
[1:45:41] and
[1:45:42] presented in such a way that made young
[1:45:45] people almost give up hope it's so hard
[1:45:47] to get it's not hard to get at all
[1:45:51] it's not hard to get at all
[1:45:53] it's your promise if you believe the
[1:45:55] word and surrender the struggle is not
[1:45:58] receiving the holy ghost the struggle is
[1:46:00] in surrender

[1:51:37] alone
[1:51:38] stood and stood and that's not just
[1:51:40] overseas i stood in florida praying for
[1:51:42] a woman that come up and was convinced
[1:51:44] she had heart trouble i knew she didn't
[1:51:46] the holy spirit spoke to my heart and i
[1:51:48] just immediately told us it says there's
[1:51:49] nothing wrong with your heart as it's
[1:51:51] the devil lying to you and it's just got
[1:51:53] you nervous and the change of life is on
[1:51:55] you you're don't you're fine let me pray
[1:51:57] a blessing of god on you and she went
[1:51:59] away from there and it was gone like
[1:52:00] that you say what did you do to her all
[1:52:03] i did was give her the promises of god's
[1:52:05] word
[1:52:06] by his strengths by his wounds you are
[1:52:10] already healed
[1:52:13] you need deliverance tonight it's yours
[1:52:15] if you want it you need the holy ghost
[1:52:16] tonight it's yours if you want it
[1:52:21] god keeps his word
[1:52:30] now
[1:52:31] i'm going to tell you something
[1:52:33] you you can jump up and down all day
[1:52:35] long but if you're not sincere before
[1:52:36] god the devil knows that
[1:52:39] if you god gives you an opportunity he
[1:52:42] doesn't say you'll take it he says there
[1:52:44] has no temptation taken you but such as
[1:52:46] his common demand but within that god
[1:52:48] has made a way that you might escape it
[1:52:50] it doesn't say you will escape it he
[1:52:51] said you could
[1:52:53] i'll make a way for you to be up to you
[1:52:55] if you take it or not
[1:52:56] see i had i had a man come to me some
[1:52:59] years ago he's having terrible marital
[1:53:00] problems
[1:53:01] and and fell and and and said he had a
[1:53:04] dream that his wife was cheating on him
[1:53:06] and i said well
[1:53:08] you know i'd have to see the dream so
[1:53:09] let's pray
[1:53:10] and see if god will show me the dream
[1:53:12] and then we'll know what we'll know what
[1:53:14] his word is and dreams operate in my
[1:53:16] life and ministry i'm not a prophet at
[1:53:17] all and usually it's a prophet that has
[1:53:18] to do that but the holy ghost can use
[1:53:20] any gifts in any holy ghost filled
[1:53:22] believer
[1:53:23] and so i prayed and sure enough i saw
[1:53:25] the dream perfectly came back sitting
[1:53:26] down in my office and i said there was
[1:53:28] this this this and i said yeah and i
[1:53:30] said you didn't tell me about this he
[1:53:31] goes oh i forgot about that i said now
[1:53:33] did you notice this certain detail about
[1:53:35] your wife
[1:53:36] do you remember this in the dream he
[1:53:37] goes yeah
[1:53:39] you're right that was true and i said

[1:56:06] all closed their eyes and gathered in a
[1:56:07] circle when they opened their eyes he
[1:56:09] was gone and the little guy had rolled
[1:56:11] right between one of them's legs rolled
[1:56:13] out the door and disappeared into the
[1:56:15] night into the jungle
[1:56:17] and all the deacons and everybody's
[1:56:19] running around with flashlights and the
[1:56:21] parents are screaming and brother the
[1:56:23] brother the pastor i won't call his name
[1:56:24] he just takes his flashlight and he said
[1:56:26] lord where's the child and the lord said
[1:56:28] go forward and he'll start walking
[1:56:30] forward i'm going to tell you the sons
[1:56:32] of god are led by the spirit of god and
[1:56:34] he said go here now turn right and he
[1:56:35] turn right now go some more now turn
[1:56:37] left now go some more now stop shine
[1:56:40] your light in that tree and he shined up
[1:56:41] and there was the child
[1:56:43] and they brought him down and took him
[1:56:44] back into the church and commanded the
[1:56:45] demon to come out of him and he stood on
[1:56:47] his feet like a normal child for the
[1:56:49] first time in years
[1:56:51] how how how had a man brought he wasn't
[1:56:53] even a believer had a man a man brought
[1:56:55] he was an idol worshiper and brought his
[1:56:57] wife
[1:56:58] into the church because this pastor has
[1:57:00] a reputation for casting out devils
[1:57:03] even the even the police come get him at
[1:57:05] two or three and four in the morning to
[1:57:06] go cast the devil out of a crazy person
[1:57:08] they can't handle
[1:57:11] and the woman come in and brother
[1:57:14] and the brother began to speak to her
[1:57:17] and she hit the floor and started
[1:57:18] writhing like a snake and hissing and
[1:57:21] she slithered up to him and tried to
[1:57:22] bite him but he said you can't touch me
[1:57:24] the power of jesus stops you and she got
[1:57:26] within inches and she couldn't go any
[1:57:28] further and she rolled around and
[1:57:30] screamed and cried and a man's voice
[1:57:32] started speaking out of her and said and
[1:57:35] this this couple had had she had been
[1:57:37] pregnant four or five times
[1:57:40] and every time she had a miscarriage and
[1:57:42] this demon started speaking out of her
[1:57:44] in a male voice and said i am the one
[1:57:47] because the pastor said who are you and
[1:57:49] he wouldn't want to say it in the name
[1:57:50] of jesus i command you who are you
[1:57:53] and he said i'm the one who has been
[1:57:54] eating the fetuses every time she
[1:57:57] conceives i eat the child
[1:57:59] and the pastor said you will come out of
[1:58:01] her and he said i won't come out of her
[1:58:02] and he said you will come and i asked
[1:58:04] him one time i said brother i said what
[1:58:07] what do you do if the devil won't come
[1:58:09] out he goes no this is not allowed
[1:58:20] i thought
[1:58:22] okay
[1:58:24] okay
[1:58:25] man said that's not allowed i guess
[1:58:26] that's not allowed
[1:58:28] okay devil is not allowed you're coming
[1:58:30] out
[1:58:30] and he commanded that devil to come out
[1:58:32] of her and it actually ended up being
[1:58:33] multiple devils cast every one of them
[1:58:35] out and a year later he sent me a
[1:58:37] picture the man gave his heart to jesus
[1:58:40] christ the woman gave her heart to
[1:58:41] christ and they were standing there
[1:58:43] dedicating a baby
[1:58:46] i'm here to tell you something friend
[1:58:47] god still moves for anyone who'll
[1:58:50] believe his word
[1:58:59] in fact is later the pastor told me he
[1:59:02] told me that that actually the lord come
[1:59:04] to him the whole time cops were coming
[1:59:06] knocking on his door at three in the
[1:59:07] morning they'd take him out away from
[1:59:08] his family he'd cast demons out and come
[1:59:10] back home he said as soon as i entered
[1:59:11] my village all the dogs would start
[1:59:12] howling again as soon as i walked in the
[1:59:14] village because i knew demons were
[1:59:15] trying to follow me
[1:59:16] brother madam talks about those things
[1:59:18] those things are real friends don't let
[1:59:19] anybody ever tell you a devil's not real
[1:59:22] don't let anybody ever tell you jesus
[1:59:24] isn't more real
[1:59:26] hallelujah
[1:59:28] and and
[1:59:29] and finally the lord told him and said
[1:59:31] don't go anymore
[1:59:32] said tell those people to come to church
[1:59:34] and hear the word of god and repent and
[1:59:36] i'll heal them so this ain't just a
[1:59:38] circus i'm not here just casting out
[1:59:39] devils for no reason and when the police
[1:59:41] came back he said you bring him to
[1:59:43] church sunday morning
[1:59:44] keep him in chains and bring him sunday
[1:59:46] morning and they'd bring him and he'd
[1:59:47] come in with chains and leave without
[1:59:49] them
[1:59:50] hallelujah oh i've seen it friends i've
[1:59:53] seen it i'm here to tell you i've seen

[2:00:14] kill him he would just stop the angel
[2:00:16] lord said they're hiding right there
[2:00:17] call them out
[2:00:18] and he would call them out and they'd
[2:00:19] come before say because you have agreed
[2:00:21] and coveted
[2:00:22] one man died within minutes another man
[2:00:24] died within months and another man died
[2:00:26] seven or eight months later
[2:00:28] one man tried tried to tried to strike
[2:00:31] him tried to strike the death blow on
[2:00:33] him and the holy spirit struck him first
[2:00:35] and he fell to his face and hit a rock
[2:00:37] busted all of his teeth out and ran off
[2:00:39] later till he died
[2:00:41] i'm here to tell you this is a serious
[2:00:43] god
[2:00:44] god is serious about his word he was he
[2:00:46] was walking by the john one time he was
[2:00:48] coming back through the village because
[2:00:49] his village had sent him out he was only
[2:00:51] 15 years old and they ostracized him
[2:00:54] sent him out of the village his dad was
[2:00:55] the king of the tribe
[2:00:56] and they sent him out to live and he was
[2:00:58] naked and hungry and he said one night
[2:01:00] he was walking back to his hideout and
[2:01:02] the holy spirit said stop right here and
[2:01:03] he stopped and he said there's assassins
[2:01:05] hiding and he said where are they lord
[2:01:07] he said there's one there in the bushes
[2:01:09] one over here behind a tree one over
[2:01:10] here and one back there and they're all
[2:01:12] waiting as soon as you go through the
[2:01:13] gauntlet they're going to wipe you out
[2:01:15] and he said what do i do he said just

[2:01:18] all of a sudden
[2:01:19] that light missiles call them what you
[2:01:21] want
[2:01:22] little missiles of light started flying
[2:01:24] over his head
[2:01:26] and blowing those guys up boom boom boom
[2:01:29] he said oh you never heard so much
[2:01:30] screaming men running screaming

[2:01:34] village
[2:01:35] the light chased them beyond they ran
[2:01:37] past their homes into the jungles
[2:01:41] and god preserved his life to this very
[2:01:43] days a pastor's the largest church in
[2:01:45] uganda
[2:01:46] has 200 young people just young people
[2:01:49] has a jungle church it's impossible for
[2:01:51] him to have that many people with a
[2:01:52] jungle church but he has the largest
[2:01:54] church in all uganda and the power of
[2:01:55] god moves in him and and the people know
[2:01:58] it and respect him

[2:02:01] make jesus christ first in your life
[2:02:05] first in your life then god can move in
[2:02:08] your life as well

[2:02:11] africa and there's a pastor there who
[2:02:13] went on to be with the lord just
[2:02:14] recently and when we got we got there me
[2:02:17] and some other brothers we found that he
[2:02:19] was under the influence of an evil
[2:02:20] spirit he's a very nice man but clearly
[2:02:23] he was under the influence of a lying
[2:02:25] prophecy spirit he'd given several
[2:02:27] prophecies they weren't true they hadn't
[2:02:28] come to pass and he wouldn't he wouldn't
[2:02:30] be corrected and we got there and he
[2:02:32] finally humbled himself and we put him
[2:02:34] in a circle and we gathered around him
[2:02:36] and started praying and i'll tell you
[2:02:37] something friends
[2:02:39] i'm not
[2:02:40] responsible to make you believe it i can
[2:02:41] only tell you what happened i was
[2:02:43] standing there with my eyes closed and
[2:02:44] my head bowed and suddenly i was looking
[2:02:47] at a demon spirit literally rising up
[2:02:50] out of this man and screaming yeah
[2:02:54] as he went off and drifted off and that
[2:02:56] that pastor was set free right then and
[2:02:58] right there he stayed a faithful servant
[2:03:00] of god till the day god called him home
[2:03:02] just recently
[2:03:04] i'm here to tell you god still moves in
[2:03:06] his people

[2:09:53] she came with me to give me a testimony
[2:09:55] and she said that
[2:09:57] she had been bound
[2:09:59] by a demon of depression
[2:10:02] and and oppression and she lived
[2:10:05] every day
[2:10:07] in a very dark place
[2:10:10] very dark
[2:10:11] she couldn't see she
[2:10:14] as if she just lived in a basement
[2:10:17] and she'd go out in the sunshine and to
[2:10:19] her it was just gloom
[2:10:21] it didn't matter what blessings came her
[2:10:23] way didn't matter her family loved her
[2:10:26] her grandchildren loved her they would
[2:10:28] kiss on her like any grandchild would
[2:10:30] but she lived in darkness and she didn't
[2:10:32] know why
[2:10:33] she was constantly depressed constantly
[2:10:36] gloom she couldn't escape it
[2:10:43] she had a dream
[2:10:46] and in the dream
[2:10:47] she was in a dark dungeon
[2:10:50] like a like a deep root cellar she said
[2:10:53] way down
[2:10:54] and she said it was so dark she said i
[2:10:56] couldn't see anything it was all black i
[2:10:58] couldn't see so i couldn't see my hand
[2:11:00] in front of my face
[2:11:02] she said i'm just walking through
[2:11:04] pitch black darkness
[2:11:06] and she said suddenly
[2:11:08] a light open and she said i realized
[2:11:11] there was a spiral staircase
[2:11:14] that opened at a door and she said a
[2:11:16] little girl
[2:11:18] opened that door and looked at me
[2:11:20] because that's where that came on her
[2:11:24] and she ran to that staircase and ran up
[2:11:27] that spiral staircase and the little
[2:11:28] girl moved out of the way and she burst
[2:11:30] into the light and she woke up
[2:11:34] later that day her phone rang
