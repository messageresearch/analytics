[39:44] goes now Faith is the substance of
[39:47] things hoped for the evidence of Things
[39:51] Not Seen for by it the elders obtained a
[39:56] good report through faith we understand
[39:59] that the worlds were framed by the word
[40:02] of God so that things which are seen
[40:06] were not made of things which do appear
[40:10] so we we're learning that everything
[40:14] that is came from nothing that
[40:17] is amen everything that is in existence
[40:22] from the earth you stand on to the air
[40:25] you breathe to the Galaxy that the
[40:27] this Earth hangs into all the galaxies
[40:31] outside of
[40:33] that all were brought into existence by
[40:38] the word of God Amen and then there's a
[40:41] people that would live on the earth
[40:44] spoken of in verse two called the elders
[40:47] and it is through that exact same Faith
[40:51] whatever that
[40:53] is we're going to try to identify it a
[40:55] little closer today let's just suffice
[40:57] it to say that whatever it was that that
[41:02] created everything from nothing is what
[41:05] they used to to have a testimony in
[41:08] their life that it was a good report in
[41:10] the mind of God Amen now it doesn't mean
[41:13] they're Perfect People The Beauty of of
[41:16] the operation of perfect faith is is
[41:19] that it causes you to stand in the view
[41:21] of God much higher than you would view
[41:24] your own self amen and we find out in
[41:29] verse one so I've went from 3 to two
[41:31] back to one that this faith is
[41:34] definitely not just a
[41:38] thought it's a substance it's actually
[41:41] an Evidence an Evidence is an Evidence
[41:43] if it doesn't exist it's real it's
[41:46] already real amen so whatever your faith
[41:52] is claiming in the word of God it's
[41:55] already real
[41:57] it's not something it's not like a hope
[42:00] I hope it comes to pass it already has
[42:03] come to pass amen amen and when you are
[42:06] walking by substance Faith which is
[42:08] perfect Faith then all you're doing is
[42:11] persevering toward a promise because
[42:13] Hebrews chapter 11 is all about
[42:17] perseverance amen don't lose sight of
[42:19] that he's he Paul is trying to get us to
[42:22] understand perseverance and so he goes
[42:25] to the Hall of Fame
[42:27] chapter 11 of Hebrews and he starts
[42:30] laying out the lives of God's family
[42:33] down through time right and the way that
[42:37] they proved that they were God's family
[42:40] because not everybody is but the way
[42:43] they proved that they were God's family
[42:45] is that they persevered and kept going
[42:48] forward in the promises of God and
[42:52] sometimes they had their request met
[42:56] sometimes they had them met but not in
[42:59] the way they
[43:00] prayed amen and sometimes God offered
[43:05] them something and they actually refused
[43:08] it so that they could get something
[43:09] better which meant they would have to go
[43:11] through what they were the Dilemma they
[43:14] were in
[43:16] amen all right let's
[43:19] pray father we thank you this morning
[43:22] for your word and we are asking now for
[43:24] that great mind of Christ that it was
[43:27] would bless speaker and hearer Lord we
[43:30] commit ourselves into your hands for
[43:32] leadership today how to bring forth this
[43:37] thought and if this is the last
[43:38] installment of this series then I pray
[43:41] you will seal it up completely and that
[43:44] we can get through and make every Point
[43:46] correctly we commit it to you now in
[43:48] Jesus name amen God bless you as you are
[43:52] seated now I'm going
[43:54] to have to just go from from point to
[43:58] point
[44:00] and and
[44:02] I I I want to say not in a not in a an
[44:06] arrogant way at all I'm sure you know
[44:08] I'm not like that but I've I've Whitted
[44:12] down every point that was superflous or
[44:17] redundant or repeating and so what I'm
[44:21] Whitted down to is a line item uh set of
[44:27] notes of points that I want to make and
[44:29] I want you to come along with me on a
[44:32] journey of understanding will you do it
[44:35] give me your undivided attention we
[44:36] won't keep you here uh all day you know
[44:38] I'm not long-winded but so I want to go
[44:41] Point by point and I want you just to
[44:44] follow right with me and keep your focus
[44:46] so we found out last time and as we
[44:50] closed out last Sunday in in the uh
[44:53] ninth installment we found out one of
[44:55] the great things as we we came down to
[44:57] the end one of the last points I made
[45:00] was that I don't get graded by things
[45:03] that do appear now that's particularly
[45:06] delicious for me because I don't
[45:09] sometimes when I look in the mirror of
[45:10] God's word and I'm looking at me
[45:13] compared to this I don't like how I
[45:15] appear amen I'm glad to know that that
[45:21] that my relationship to this word is not
[45:26] based on and will not be graded on how
[45:30] much of it I get an A on Amen in my in
[45:35] my manifestation because what I will get
[45:38] an A+ on is I believe every bit of it
[45:41] amen amen and even the parts that I find
[45:45] that I come up short on there's an
[45:49] inside desire down inside of me that I
[45:52] don't want to come up short and there's
[45:55] an inside desire inside of me that says
[45:58] Lord whatever you have to do whatever by
[46:03] whatever means necessary I want you to
[46:07] bring this image to look like this image
[46:10] amen amen amen yes and so this was I
[46:13] think this is what Jesus was partially
[46:16] referring to when he taught us how to
[46:17] pray that he wanted the the image in
[46:20] heaven to look like the image on Earth
[46:22] let your will be done in this Earth as
[46:25] it already exists in heaven see there's
[46:29] already a representation of God's entire
[46:32] family not that it it came into heaven
[46:35] on the day they on their birth
[46:38] certificate that they were born but they
[46:41] they always were in the mind of God
[46:45] these are things that we understand in
[46:47] past teaching we're not going to recover
[46:49] that today so the beautiful part is is
[46:52] that I'm not limited to what appears and
[46:57] that's beautiful because then that means
[47:00] that no matter what the devil will will
[47:02] accuse me of even if he has the DNA
[47:05] evidence that I'm actually guilty in
[47:07] this flesh it can't count against me
[47:10] because I have an atonement which is the
[47:12] blood of Christ which speaks for me
[47:14] perpetually at all times amen and God
[47:18] doesn't see me he's not looking at me he
[47:20] sees My Sacrifice which is Christ Jesus
[47:24] that's a beautiful thing and therefore
[47:27] that means then now all right we've gone
[47:29] that far then that means also that that
[47:34] this body although it is limited to the
[47:40] space-time Continuum the physical laws
[47:42] of nature uh the rules of physics um uh
[47:47] but but understand that if God should
[47:50] determine to do something through this
[47:52] body it wouldn't necessarily be bound by
[47:55] any of those right yeah that I could if
[47:58] he decided to bid me come like he did
[48:01] Peter I could walk on top of
[48:04] water the dead actually could come back
[48:07] to life and a body that's dead and the
[48:09] life is gone life could come back into
[48:11] it incurable diseases can be
[48:15] disappeared amen
[48:17] amen I he say well what's the limits
[48:21] here's the limits are you ready I can
[48:24] do all things through through Christ who
[48:28] strengthens
[48:30] me so we know that God created the
[48:34] heavens and the Earth we made this point
[48:36] last time and yet Hebrews 11 tells us
[48:41] that the substance of Faith made it but
[48:43] I know God made it but Hebrews 11 is
[48:46] saying the substance of Faith made the
[48:49] Earth and made everything so you know so
[48:52] then it comes down so so then when I
[48:55] when I think of it like that
[48:57] I realize that the substance of faith is
[49:01] is More Than A Feeling or a thought amen
[49:06] then I have to conclude if God created
[49:09] it and substance Faith created it then
[49:11] substance faith and God are the same
[49:13] thing amen amen or you've got a
[49:17] contradiction in scripture so when we
[49:20] talk about perfect Faith it's not a
[49:22] feeling or it's not a thought it's a sub
[49:26] substance that created the heavens and
[49:29] the Earth it's it what it is at the end
[49:32] of the day is a material expression of
[49:35] God himself all right so the Earth is
[49:39] what an eternal attribute of God that's
[49:41] why it can't be annihilated so the Earth
[49:44] is not something that that God just
[49:48] spoke into existence he expressed the
[49:52] universe he expressed the Earth you see
[49:56] just like Brandon would talk about very
[49:58] scientifically you take a piece of paper
[50:00] this is scientifically true you take a
[50:03] piece of paper and you burn it and you
[50:05] say I have now annihilated that piece of
[50:09] paper but that's not true mankind
[50:12] doesn't possess the ability to
[50:14] annihilate anything out of existence all
[50:17] you've done when you burn that paper is
[50:19] you you you changed it you transformed
[50:22] it back to its original gases and
[50:25] elements uh that are on the periodic
[50:27] table whatever he say well it was wood
[50:29] before that what was it before it was
[50:30] wood all right so so we realize he talks
[50:34] about how that if time would go on long
[50:36] enough it could it could re regrow
[50:39] another tree be remanufactured and come
[50:42] back to paper
[50:43] again amen amen so so when we when we
[50:48] think about God creating his family we
[50:52] talk about how that God created man and
[50:54] we realize that this was God expressing
[50:58] his entire family and I proved to you
[51:00] last time that in the mind of God you
[51:03] always have
[51:05] existed because God can't have a new
[51:07] thought we proved that last time didn't
[51:09] we and so when you think of it like that
[51:11] then you suddenly be it begins to occur
[51:13] to you that if God had simply just
[51:17] spoken you into creation and you were
[51:20] not an expression of him for instance
[51:23] hell was created by God for the devil
[51:27] and his angels but hell is not an
[51:29] eternal expression of God it was created
[51:31] for a purpose and the Bible talks about
[51:33] it will be done away with God put it
[51:36] together God took it apart the body of
[51:38] MDC was God taking Cosmic light and
[51:41] poach and calcium and the other elements
[51:43] of a human body and he put it together
[51:45] and stepped into it and went to meet
[51:46] Abraham and when he got done he stepped
[51:48] back out of it disassembled all the
[51:50] parts you understand and that's why you
[51:53] don't hear anymore about MDC because he
[51:56] became Jesus Christ only now he's not in
[51:59] a in a in a body like that he actually
[52:02] is begotten of a woman because God
[52:04] speaks that same word into the womb of a
[52:06] virgin and it and and Child Development
[52:09] takes place this is why Jesus was not a
[52:13] demigod he wasn't a half God and a half
[52:16] human he was completely a human who was
[52:19] completely God in human
[52:22] flesh not a third person not a second
[52:24] person the very person
[52:27] so then when you think of it like that
[52:30] you realize that God didn't just create
[52:33] his family because if he had just and I
[52:37] get the King James says God created man
[52:39] his own image I'm not defying that I'm
[52:41] simply showing you that what it means is
[52:44] is that it wasn't like he created
[52:47] something uh that would then later on uh
[52:50] be uh could be done away with you
[52:54] understand so something that something
[52:57] that starts has to have an
[53:00] end only what that which never started
[53:03] has no end so God didn't just create you
[53:07] he expressed you so you came out of him
[53:11] that's why this came out of him and
[53:13] that's why I have an affinity with this
[53:16] not because I heard a sad story and
[53:18] somebody talked me into becoming a
[53:20] Christian or because I appreciate and
[53:22] and love the fine qualities of Jesus
[53:25] that's a fine thing to have the foolish
[53:27] virgin have that they they they there's
[53:30] Christians around the world who will be
[53:31] safe from destruction who admire the
[53:33] fine qualities of Jesus that's not the
[53:36] same thing as being birthed by the word
[53:39] I have returned to God I didn't become
[53:43] his son I found out I had always been
[53:45] his son and now I'm cooperating in the
[53:48] vision because the vision the word about
[53:50] me is me is him and it's the same
[53:54] thing now you're getting close close to
[53:56] perfect Faith it's a person yeah this is
[54:01] why we were promised by the Holy Ghost
[54:03] as I've said to you repeatedly we were
[54:05] not promised to have merely a faith in
[54:08] Jesus the world can have a faith in
[54:12] Jesus Christ and that brings salvation
[54:14] from destruction but the re the family
[54:17] of God are redeemed they're not merely
[54:20] safe from destruction they're redeemed
[54:23] back to God right and so so we realize
[54:26] then that that that when you when you
[54:28] start to look at it like that you
[54:30] realize you're always a part of
[54:32] something all right I've got to keep
[54:35] moving so now we're we're realizing what
[54:38] real perfect faith is it's a person who
[54:42] expressed himself in the universe listen
[54:45] friends that you are to be so thankful
[54:48] for that because this is the ability of
[54:52] God yeah you never had the ability
[54:57] you could turn over a new leaf and live
[54:59] a better life but you could never
[55:01] annihilate your sin it would always have
[55:04] a record of you that Satan could accuse
[55:06] you on but I'm here to tell you that God
[55:08] annihilated the sin when it fell into
[55:11] the blood of Christ it was annihilated
[55:14] it took you back all the way back as
[55:17] though you had never done it in the
[55:19] first
[55:20] place because you didn't do it in the
[55:24] first place cuz the first place I was
[55:27] was in the mind of God see so how do you
[55:31] know you were in the mind of God because
[55:33] I my whole life is wrapped up in the
[55:37] word that came from the mind of God and
[55:39] that proves my identity that I'm willing
[55:42] to say Amen to every word not just what
[55:47] a denomination tells me I can believe
[55:50] and limits my belief and doesn't doesn't
[55:52] doesn't require much more than just
[55:54] turning over a new leap there's all
[55:56] kinds of people who turn over a new Leaf
[55:59] that doesn't mean they're redeemed they
[56:00] sit in churches even True Churches even
[56:02] message churches that doesn't mean
[56:04] they're redeemed they believe God sent a
[56:06] prophet that doesn't mean they're
[56:07] redeemed it's that when you look into
[56:09] the word of God and no matter what it
[56:11] says about you no matter what the Lord
[56:14] tells you you've got to change the
[56:16] person sitting next to you might not
[56:17] need to give up something he tells you
[56:19] you got to give up but whatever he tells
[56:22] you you've got to separate from you to
[56:24] say Amen yes Lord I'm I'm marching to
[56:27] Zion and by the time I get there I will
[56:30] have given up everything and I'll be
[56:32] completely in your
[56:35] image so we're on a journey of
[56:39] perseverance so perfect faith is not a
[56:41] feeling it's not a thought it's a
[56:43] substance that created the heavens and
[56:44] the Earth it's a material expression of
[56:46] God
[56:47] himself that's why it's not human hope
[56:50] God expressed in the material God
[56:52] expressed in the real God expressed in
[56:54] the tangible some something that is a
[56:57] part of his very substance his very
[56:59] existence the Earth is that the word is
[57:03] that you are
[57:07] that so now I can I can more clearly see
[57:12] how that all
[57:13] creation is an is an
[57:16] unfolding expression of his very life
[57:20] and this is exactly why the Earth is an
[57:23] eternal attribute of God why it can
[57:25] never be a ated and now because I
[57:28] realize all of that and everything that
[57:30] I've just taken 15 minutes to say this
[57:33] is now I can I can more clearly see how
[57:38] he fills all time space in eternity yet
[57:41] he's not like the wind he is a being he
[57:43] lives in a house right amen he's he's
[57:47] omnipresent through his omniscience see
[57:50] so he's not like the wind so Faith's not
[57:53] like a thought amen it's a substance
[57:56] yeah he's a being he's real he's he and
[58:00] when he when he come in and live through
[58:03] Christ Christ the Bible in Hebrews 1:3
[58:07] um you don't have to turn there I'll
[58:09] just read it for you Hebrews chapter 1
[58:11] verse3 says it like this says or let me
[58:14] read from the top God who in sunary
[58:17] times or in distant times and in diverse
[58:19] manners in various ways in times past
[58:21] spake unto the fathers By His prophets
[58:23] and hath in these last days spoken unto
[58:25] us by his son Jesus Christ whom he hath
[58:29] appointed air of All Things by whom also
[58:31] he made the worlds say wait a minute I
[58:34] thought God created the heavens and the
[58:36] Earth but this is declaring that the son
[58:38] created it all Colossians says the same
[58:41] thing John the Gospel of John says the
[58:44] same things all things are made by Jesus
[58:46] Christ amen that that's what he taught
[58:48] to the Colossians that's what he taught
[58:50] to the Hebrews that's what Christ taught
[58:51] in the gospel it's what John
[58:53] records so so then so then if he who who
[58:57] created it was it God the father was it
[58:59] Jesus the son was it Faith the substance
[59:02] was it the word expressed
[59:04] yes which one
[59:07] uhhuh it's it's so it so then his bride
[59:10] is a part of him exactly now you're
[59:12] getting it say then I need to persevere
[59:15] you will persevere you're already
[59:17] persevering you're persevering today to
[59:19] believe Against All Odds I'll be there
[59:21] because I'm a part of him
[59:28] so so Paul's whole exhortation is about
[59:31] perseverance so when you're when we when
[59:35] you read Hebrews 11 and you read about
[59:38] all these Warriors of the
[59:40] faith then you realize that it's now now
[59:44] we're in the progression of of of of
[59:46] unfolding understanding you're with me
[59:48] still so our eyes are coming open open
[59:51] open and more open so then when we so
[59:55] now
[59:56] based on everything I've just said you
[59:59] realize that these people in Hebrews 11
[1:00:03] who are persevering that when you read
[1:00:05] that chapter it's not just a testimony
[1:00:09] merely about God influencing human
[1:00:12] beings but it's human beings who are
[1:00:16] themselves a part of God's life and God
[1:00:20] was accomplishing his promises not that
[1:00:23] they were they don't get the glory he
[1:00:26] gets the glory see God was accomplishing
[1:00:29] in them his promises by working through
[1:00:33] them upon them and through them in the
[1:00:34] Old Testament and now God is
[1:00:37] accomplishing his promises in the New
[1:00:40] Testament by living in the
[1:00:43] people living in and through and out so
[1:00:46] it's not something that happens after
[1:00:48] you now here here's a here's my next
[1:00:53] thought when we talk about God
[1:00:57] accomplishing his promises in those
[1:00:59] people you say yeah that's right and he
[1:01:02] accomplished it through those Old
[1:01:04] Testament Saints He Came Upon them
[1:01:06] worked through them and now by the
[1:01:08] baptism of the Holy Ghost because of
[1:01:10] that day on Calvary now he lives in us
[1:01:12] and through us and it's not a temporary
[1:01:14] thing where he has to come and go it's
[1:01:16] permanent see so so it's but it's not
[1:01:21] something that
[1:01:23] happens uh or let me just say it better
[1:01:25] like like this it's not some that's not
[1:01:27] a principle applied to you only after
[1:01:29] you come to the Altar and give your
[1:01:32] heart to the Lord amen it actually the
[1:01:35] mercy of God followed you all the days
[1:01:38] of your
[1:01:39] life you
[1:01:41] understand and so so that because the
[1:01:45] whole purpose of it is to bring us back
[1:01:48] to our original nature of your life in
[1:01:52] Christ before the foundation of the
[1:01:55] world now let me just give you a few
[1:01:58] quick examples if I can get to it so
[1:02:02] there's only three
[1:02:04] places in the New Testament where it
[1:02:08] makes that term before the foundation of
[1:02:11] the world the first place well it's not
[1:02:14] the first place but one of the three
[1:02:17] is we is
[1:02:20] Peter uh give me Josh give me First
[1:02:23] Peter chapter 1 and he's going to talk
[1:02:26] about how much that we were redeemed
[1:02:29] Verse 18 1 Peter 1:18 for as much as you
[1:02:33] know that you were not redeemed with
[1:02:37] corruptible things such as silver and
[1:02:40] gold from your vain conversation
[1:02:42] received by tradition from your fathers
[1:02:43] verse 19 but with the precious blood so
[1:02:46] you were redeemed with the precious
[1:02:49] blood of Christ as of a lamb without
[1:02:51] blemish and without spot see that's all
[1:02:53] on your behalf therefore you're with
[1:02:55] without spot and blemish in him verse 20
[1:02:59] who was verily speaking of Christ who
[1:03:02] was verily ordained before the
[1:03:06] foundation of the world look at it who
[1:03:08] verily was
[1:03:09] foreordained before the foundation of
[1:03:13] the world uh but was manifest in these
[1:03:16] last times for you so yeah Peter is
[1:03:19] saying yeah he did come he was here a
[1:03:20] few years ago however he was before the
[1:03:24] foundation of the world
[1:03:27] now the next place that it uses that
[1:03:30] terminology is going to be Ephesians
[1:03:32] chapter 4 I'm sorry Ephesians uh chapter
[1:03:35] 1 brother Josh verse
[1:03:38] four let's get verse three blessed be
[1:03:41] the God and father of our Lord Jesus
[1:03:42] Christ who hath blessed us with all
[1:03:45] spiritual blessings in Heavenly places
[1:03:47] in Christ Jesus So it's talking about
[1:03:48] the Believers all right it's not the
[1:03:51] global population it's he hath blessed
[1:03:54] us with all spirit blessing and Heavenly
[1:03:57] places in Christ Jesus according verse
[1:04:01] four as he hath chosen Us in him before
[1:04:05] the foundation of the world you've heard
[1:04:06] me say it all the time there's only one
[1:04:08] elected son according to this 42nd
[1:04:10] chapter of Isaiah there's only one
[1:04:12] elected son so then how did you become
[1:04:16] elected because I was in him he was
[1:04:18] before the foundation of the world I was
[1:04:20] in him therefore I was in him before the
[1:04:23] foundation of the world see amen and
[1:04:26] then the third place that you'll find it
[1:04:28] which is actually um chronologically
[1:04:31] speaking the first place it's mentioned
[1:04:33] is in John 17 John 17 verse 24 father I
[1:04:39] will that they also wait for the uh
[1:04:50] screen John
[1:04:52] 1724 father I will that they also are we
[1:04:56] able to get it all right there you go
[1:04:58] thank you I
[1:05:00] will that they also whom thou H has
[1:05:03] given me be with me where I am that they
[1:05:08] may behold my glory which thou Hast
[1:05:11] given me for thou lovest me before the
[1:05:14] foundation of the
[1:05:15] world so now it's very clear from John's
[1:05:20] writing and Peter's writing that Christ
[1:05:24] was before the foundation of the world
[1:05:26] and it's very clear from Paul's writing
[1:05:29] that we were identified in him before
[1:05:31] the foundation of the world there is no
[1:05:34] other place anywhere in the entire Bible
[1:05:38] where especially the New Testament where
[1:05:40] it talks about this term before the
[1:05:44] foundation when you can go to to the
[1:05:46] Book of Revelation or when you go to the
[1:05:49] 25th chapter of ma of of Matthew which
[1:05:51] we're not going to go there but you
[1:05:53] remember that the bride is seated with
[1:05:55] him on the throne and before him are the
[1:05:57] is the populations of the Earth from all
[1:05:59] that down through all time remember the
[1:06:01] great great white Throne judgment the
[1:06:03] seed gave up its dead the dead both
[1:06:05] small and great stood Before the Throne
[1:06:07] there's one seated on the throne and the
[1:06:09] the the the the heavens departed as a
[1:06:11] scroll you remember that and so you find
[1:06:14] out that that we're that the world is
[1:06:17] being judged not the bride she's passed
[1:06:19] from Death to life cuz her identity was
[1:06:21] always in the word amen so Christ being
[1:06:25] the word was judged on your behalf so
[1:06:27] how are you going to be judged if if the
[1:06:29] same word that he's a part of that
[1:06:31] you're a part of and he got judged in
[1:06:33] him why would you stand before the
[1:06:35] Judgment see so things that are may not
[1:06:41] be as things that appear I may not
[1:06:45] appear perfect but I are
[1:06:49] perfect Hallelujah why because I'm great
[1:06:52] no cuz he was great and because you say
[1:06:55] because you decided to follow him no
[1:06:56] because I was in him and I could not
[1:06:58] follow him I heard my sheep hear my
[1:07:04] voice they hear all of
[1:07:06] it there's many people who hear parts of
[1:07:09] his voice but refuse to hear all of his
[1:07:12] voice they'll suffer for that Amen in
[1:07:15] the regions
[1:07:16] Beyond especially preachers who tell
[1:07:19] people the word of God doesn't matter
[1:07:20] and you don't have to obey it in all of
[1:07:22] its dictates that that that Minister
[1:07:24] will suffer for that in the region
[1:07:25] Beyond that's a direct quote see and so
[1:07:29] so we find then that that because
[1:07:32] remember that the ones who were
[1:07:34] condemned at the Judgment bar were those
[1:07:36] who were workers of iniquity who knew
[1:07:39] the word of God said that but made a
[1:07:41] decision not to follow it the ones who
[1:07:43] who were granted eternal life whatever
[1:07:47] they did was in ignorance if they didn't
[1:07:49] follow it all it was ignorance but they
[1:07:51] really did love God see it was different
[1:07:54] than having the love of God cuz that's
[1:07:55] the new birth but they did have a
[1:07:57] genuine love for God and they will be
[1:08:00] safe from destruction amen but to them
[1:08:03] he says enter into the joys of the Lord
[1:08:07] prepared for you not before because they
[1:08:11] you're not in the group on the throne
[1:08:13] they were pred prepared for you since
[1:08:15] the foundation of the world you can go
[1:08:19] into the Book of Revelation and it says
[1:08:21] all speaking about the Antichrist the
[1:08:23] Beast system All Shall worship Him whose
[1:08:27] names were not written in the book of of
[1:08:30] life of the Lamb since the foundation of
[1:08:33] the world Amen you understand so there
[1:08:35] is a book of life Judas had his name in
[1:08:38] that book but it got it got taken out
[1:08:41] because of his betrayal of the word amen
[1:08:44] because he was a worker of iniquity so
[1:08:46] if you can arrive there and your name is
[1:08:49] still in that book of life then you've
[1:08:50] got a chance you're going to get a fair
[1:08:52] trial and and God rich in Mercy will
[1:08:54] judge people from from their heart but
[1:08:56] the bride is already judged it's already
[1:08:58] over she was in Christ before the
[1:09:01] foundation of the
[1:09:02] world
[1:09:05] see and only my point is that it speaks
[1:09:10] of people speaks of a segment of
[1:09:13] humanity that that indeed it was
[1:09:16] prepared for them and their names were
[1:09:17] put in a book since the foundation of
[1:09:19] the world but only to the elect lady
[1:09:22] only to the bride only those who are an
[1:09:25] expression of the full word does it say
[1:09:28] you were there before the foundation of
[1:09:31] the world you were identified in the
[1:09:33] word in Christ before the foundation of
[1:09:37] the world I said that one time sitting
[1:09:40] uh to someone who was contending with me
[1:09:42] and a a Baptist Minister and and he just
[1:09:46] he said to me he said are you trying to
[1:09:48] tell me that there are people in the
[1:09:51] earth who are the children of God and
[1:09:54] and there are people people in the earth
[1:09:56] who are the children of the devil excuse
[1:09:59] me and who are children of the devil and
[1:10:02] I said well I don't teach that he said
[1:10:05] well I'm glad I said but Jesus
[1:10:08] did that's not my Doctrine but Jesus
[1:10:12] when he's asked about the parable of the
[1:10:14] S it's simple he said the Earth the the
[1:10:16] seed the field is the world the seed is
[1:10:19] the children of the Kingdom the one that
[1:10:21] Seth them is the son of man the weeds
[1:10:24] are the children of of the evil one or
[1:10:26] the wicked one and the one that slded
[1:10:28] them is the
[1:10:29] devil so I'm sorry you don't you don't
[1:10:32] have to believe me but you need to
[1:10:34] believe him
[1:10:36] see all
[1:10:39] right you still with
[1:10:44] me so when I when I look at it like
[1:10:48] that then this
[1:10:53] explains it explains the in
[1:10:56] inexplicable things that followed my
[1:10:59] life that followed your life amen and I
[1:11:02] I I get to stand up here today because I
[1:11:04] got the microphone and I can tell you
[1:11:05] about a few instances in my life but so
[1:11:08] could you you could also tell of times
[1:11:12] before you came to to Christ before you
[1:11:15] came to your senses and escaped your
[1:11:16] spiritual Amnesia before you got the
[1:11:19] baptism of the Holy Ghost there was
[1:11:21] always something a prophet would say
[1:11:22] that you were always different something
[1:11:24] about you even when you were running
[1:11:25] with the crowd and doing everything
[1:11:27] about them you always felt a little bit
[1:11:30] like an outsider we're not talking about
[1:11:31] whether you enjoyed it or whether you
[1:11:33] did it whether you rebeled in it we're
[1:11:34] not talking about that but there was
[1:11:36] every time when you went to sleep or you
[1:11:38] woke up and you sobered up you realized
[1:11:40] something's
[1:11:42] wrong something's wrong but the the
[1:11:45] world never comes to that they're just
[1:11:47] like I love it I'm going to keep doing
[1:11:49] it but to the Son of God to the daughter
[1:11:51] of God no matter how hard you run no
[1:11:54] matter how long it takes takes surely
[1:11:56] goodness and mercy will follow you all
[1:11:59] the days of your
[1:12:02] life it explains events that can only be
[1:12:05] explained by the supernatural it
[1:12:06] explains to me how I sat in I had a
[1:12:10] prayer place in the woods as a teenager
[1:12:13] out behind our house and my mom knew I
[1:12:15] would I'd leave out of the house and I'd
[1:12:18] have my Bible and she'd see me and I'd
[1:12:19] have my dogs and we'd disappear into the
[1:12:21] woods she was never worried she knew
[1:12:23] where I was going and I had a secret
[1:12:24] place couldn't find me it was a a laurel
[1:12:27] Thicket had grown into a perfect circle
[1:12:29] and it looked impenetrable until you
[1:12:30] went through it and then it was an open
[1:12:32] area and it was just a beautiful perfect
[1:12:34] place and it explains to me why when I
[1:12:37] was sitting there praying and I've got
[1:12:40] my Bible in front of me and I'm praying
[1:12:42] Lord I just want to know what's this
[1:12:44] pull why do I feel this in my life what
[1:12:46] is it you want me to do I was only 15
[1:12:48] years old what is it you want me to do
[1:12:51] maybe 14 15 something like that and a
[1:12:54] wind comes through which should have
[1:12:55] really been impossible it just seemed to
[1:12:57] dip down in there and just swirl around
[1:12:59] and I heard my pages
[1:13:01] going and so I just with my eyes closed
[1:13:04] I just stopped it it was going I just
[1:13:06] stopped it I finished my prayer Lord
[1:13:09] please tell me what it is that you want
[1:13:11] me to do and I finished praying and I
[1:13:13] looked down and my eyes fell on you
[1:13:17] shall be a witness unto me in Jerusalem
[1:13:19] Judea and Samaria and the uttermost part
[1:13:21] of the earth you shall receive power
[1:13:23] after the Holy Ghost has come upon you
[1:13:25] you shall be a witness to me Jerusalem
[1:13:26] Judea Samaria the uttermost part of the
[1:13:28] earth and and and I I understand now why
[1:13:32] that happened to me and might not have
[1:13:35] happened to my neighbor friend right it
[1:13:38] didn't make me better than him it just
[1:13:40] meant that I had a different origin
[1:13:45] see it informs my thinking when sister
[1:13:49] Jean tells that I mean how many times
[1:13:51] the enemy tried to take my life before I
[1:13:53] could stand here today and preach you
[1:13:55] all and as a baby I I I I contracted uh
[1:14:00] rise syndrome which is colloquially
[1:14:03] called brain fever it's not kind of a
[1:14:05] misnomer a little bit do doctors would
[1:14:07] know that but it it just basically rise
[1:14:11] syndrome is a is an inflammation of the
[1:14:13] of the liver or the brain because of
[1:14:15] when you're sometimes when a child or
[1:14:17] even a teenager is recovering from an
[1:14:19] infection like chickenpox or the flu and
[1:14:21] you give them aspirin that's why they
[1:14:22] say don't give them Aspirin because then
[1:14:24] that can have the wrong kind of reaction
[1:14:27] and for whatever reason and and anywhere
[1:14:29] from a third to half almost half uh
[1:14:32] that's
[1:14:33] fatal right and God preserved me and and
[1:14:37] I still have a pretty good mind I
[1:14:39] [Laughter]
[1:14:45] think I I I almost I almost drowned
[1:14:48] twice growing up and I'm an expert
[1:14:50] swimmer I swim like a fish and I almost
[1:14:54] drown twice went too far out
[1:14:56] overconfident almost couldn't get back
[1:14:58] in twice both times I thought I'm not
[1:15:00] going to make it and somehow I just kept
[1:15:03] putting one stroke and after the next
[1:15:05] and the next thing I know my feet hit
[1:15:06] dry land and
[1:15:08] I you know and and and in the second
[1:15:11] time it was my kid brother who actually
[1:15:13] swam out and saved me brought me a a
[1:15:15] float and when he brought it to me I
[1:15:17] realized I was just panicked I didn't
[1:15:18] even need it I handed it back to him he
[1:15:20] was gassed from Power swimming out I
[1:15:22] swam back in and it just the the the
[1:15:25] enemy trying to trying to take my life
[1:15:28] that happened so many times so many
[1:15:30] times I you have those same stories I
[1:15:32] remember one time B running out of a
[1:15:34] place I had oh boy let me not get too
[1:15:37] too transparent here I was just very
[1:15:40] young and and I'm in the wrong crowd and
[1:15:42] I'm I'm I'm in that crowd sister Jean
[1:15:44] was always trying to keep me
[1:15:46] from and I'm I'm you know something
[1:15:49] breaks out and there's a there's a
[1:15:50] conflict and and somebody you know pulls
[1:15:53] a gun and I'm running
[1:15:55] and you're you're hearing shots go off
[1:15:57] and you're hearing the conc you're
[1:15:59] feeling and hearing the concussion go
[1:16:00] right by
[1:16:02] you now you think you're already running
[1:16:05] full speed when that
[1:16:07] happens but I promise you you can run
[1:16:15] faster
[1:16:18] see but
[1:16:20] friends if God is following us like that
[1:16:25] then then this means that even when
[1:16:28] Satan obtained a seeming victory over
[1:16:32] one of God's children he still couldn't
[1:16:35] win it it means that this is precisely
[1:16:39] why even in Failure that those of
[1:16:42] Hebrews 11 even when it looked like
[1:16:44] Satan won he couldn't win even when it
[1:16:47] looked like they had a failure you can
[1:16:48] read in the Bible where his family had
[1:16:50] plenty of failures but even when they
[1:16:52] had failures they couldn't fail even
[1:16:54] when you have a failure you can't fail
[1:16:57] even when it looks like Satan got a
[1:16:58] victory over you he still can't
[1:17:02] win because no word of God can be
[1:17:05] stopped and you're a part of that word
[1:17:07] and that's the part of you that can't
[1:17:10] ever be lost that's the part of the word
[1:17:12] that no matter what hold Satan has on
[1:17:16] one of God's family the truth is he
[1:17:19] can't hold them forever because you
[1:17:22] recognize that you are a part of the
[1:17:24] same word word that created heavens and
[1:17:27] earth I say it unabashedly I am part of
[1:17:31] the I came from the same word that
[1:17:33] created the heavens and the
[1:17:36] Earth see so that you know that that's
[1:17:40] why I mean when a when a when a prophet
[1:17:42] is told and he's he's seeing people
[1:17:44] behind bars and the the Lord says you
[1:17:48] know free those people and he says well
[1:17:50] how how am I going to do that my little
[1:17:52] skinny arms and he said those great big
[1:17:54] iron bars
[1:17:55] and he said people were just beating
[1:17:56] their heads insane and the Holy Spirit
[1:17:58] said free those people and he said well
[1:18:01] all I could think to say was House of
[1:18:03] Hell give way to the name of the Lord
[1:18:06] Jesus Christ and he said popping and
[1:18:07] creaking and busting and bars collaps
[1:18:10] and people began running out I'm here to
[1:18:12] tell you you ran out of there I ran out
[1:18:13] of there because House of Hell giveway
[1:18:16] works from you it works for me if you
[1:18:19] got children if you got a family to say
[1:18:21] house of Hell give way in the name of
[1:18:23] Jesus Christ you got a problem in your
[1:18:25] life say House of Hell give
[1:18:31] way that includes me that that friends
[1:18:34] that is perfect
[1:18:37] Faith let me say this in case I forget
[1:18:40] to say it at the
[1:18:41] end why this is a 10-part
[1:18:44] series why would I make the last
[1:18:47] probably five or six parts of it a part
[1:18:51] of a series called uh where where we're
[1:18:55] opposing the Judgment of Heaven because
[1:18:59] as I've said to you though you live in a
[1:19:02] world where everything that God is for
[1:19:06] the world is against amen they
[1:19:09] demonstrate to be against it yeah
[1:19:12] everything he's for and everything he's
[1:19:14] against they demonstrate and pass laws
[1:19:17] to give themselves everything he's
[1:19:20] opposed to so how are we going to escape
[1:19:24] it you're not there's no ability that
[1:19:27] you have that can overcome this world
[1:19:30] only perfect Faith so it's necessary to
[1:19:34] show you today yes the world rejects it
[1:19:37] yes the world is going to be destroyed
[1:19:39] yes they're going to their destruction
[1:19:40] it's irreversible it's irrevocable
[1:19:43] they're headed there by all possible
[1:19:45] speed but I'm not going down with it
[1:19:48] Hallelujah I plan to go up to a meeting
[1:19:51] in the air and I'll do that because I've
[1:19:54] understood the operation of perfect
[1:19:56] faith that it's a that it's the very
[1:19:58] substance of God moving through me see
[1:20:02] you you claiming the promise of the word
[1:20:05] in restored Fellowship then there's
[1:20:07] nothing that can stand before your
[1:20:11] prayers on any promise of God Amen it's
[1:20:15] not just to a prophet let me say it
[1:20:17] again when you are claiming the promise
[1:20:19] of the
[1:20:20] word and you're living in a restored
[1:20:23] Fellowship
[1:20:25] then there's nothing that can stand
[1:20:26] before your prayers when you claim any
[1:20:29] promise of God Amen this is very this is
[1:20:34] the very
[1:20:35] Foundation that
[1:20:37] principle is the very foundation on
[1:20:40] which perfect faith is built because
[1:20:42] perfect faith is based on this
[1:20:45] Supernatural reality of God's being that
[1:20:49] I'm a part of him it's not about a human
[1:20:53] hope that he'll perform his word his
[1:20:56] word and he are the same thing and he
[1:20:59] lives in me therefore I and his word are
[1:21:02] one therefore I can claim a promise and
[1:21:05] it comes to pass am see so all promises
[1:21:10] in the
[1:21:11] word that have ever been made or ever
[1:21:16] would be made they were made in Christ
[1:21:19] before the foundation of the world so
[1:21:23] they operated in the Old Testament
[1:21:25] family of God for thousands of years
[1:21:29] before that day on Calvary and Calvary
[1:21:32] itself made it possible that what had
[1:21:34] been done under a temporary substitute
[1:21:37] could now become a permanent reality in
[1:21:40] his family that's that's part of what
[1:21:43] the Holy Ghost is given for
[1:21:46] amen every thought indeed of Our Lives
[1:21:51] was fixed in the mind of God Before Time
[1:21:54] and nothing can stop it you
[1:21:56] say even my mistakes and failures let me
[1:22:00] just say this let going say it in two
[1:22:02] part part a god knew you'd do it Part B
[1:22:05] God knew you'd
[1:22:07] repent God knew that would happen so he
[1:22:09] sent Christ to go ahead and live a
[1:22:11] perfect life on your behalf so he
[1:22:13] wouldn't count that against you and the
[1:22:14] only part of his vision that he counts
[1:22:16] is seeing you repent and seeing you come
[1:22:19] back to Faith see you did all kinds of
[1:22:22] things in your former life but Mercy see
[1:22:24] surely goodness and mercy was following
[1:22:27] you even
[1:22:28] then see so nothing can stop it that's
[1:22:31] why Romans 8 says but if we hope for
[1:22:35] that we see not then do we with patience
[1:22:38] wait for it so when human hope operates
[1:22:41] without perfect Faith then that's
[1:22:44] exactly why brother brandham said hope
[1:22:47] is the greatest hindrance faith has yeah
[1:22:50] because we're talking about we're not
[1:22:52] talking about Hope in a a revelation of
[1:22:55] who you are and who he is and everything
[1:22:56] I've been preaching on but human hope
[1:22:59] that hopes that God will decide to do
[1:23:02] it I I'm not asking him to do it I'm
[1:23:06] asking him to give me the Revelation
[1:23:07] It's Already Done amen so I would say if
[1:23:10] he was standing here in this suit and
[1:23:12] you were sick and he would say my child
[1:23:13] you say Lord please Heal Me You' say I
[1:23:15] can't do that cuz I've already done it
[1:23:17] 2,000 years ago everything in the
[1:23:21] atonement was made for his family at on
[1:23:24] that day at Calvary so true perfect
[1:23:26] faith says that the promises of God uh
[1:23:30] are Eternal and therefore if they're
[1:23:33] Eternal then they already are amen
[1:23:36] because they already are when we pray
[1:23:40] then you realize now that it's a deep
[1:23:43] calling to a
[1:23:45] deep that the the reason you want to be
[1:23:48] well is because there is a wellbody
[1:23:49] representing you the reason you want to
[1:23:51] see his word come to pass in your life
[1:23:53] that's a deep inside you calling to
[1:23:55] something that is that already is not
[1:23:58] might be can be someday it'll be it is
[1:24:01] already see and so so even even if the
[1:24:06] and let me say it like this I so I was
[1:24:08] so appreciating by the Caleb's Sunday
[1:24:09] school class today and and and fact is
[1:24:12] right when I was looking at this very
[1:24:15] note brother Caleb was preaching on this
[1:24:17] very
[1:24:19] thing even if the Deep desire hear me
[1:24:23] well
[1:24:25] even if the Deep desire that I'm calling
[1:24:27] for for whatever I happen to
[1:24:31] need even if that deep desire that I'm
[1:24:33] calling for doesn't match what God has
[1:24:36] for me then he grants my prayer
[1:24:40] according to his perfect will even when
[1:24:43] it's different than how I prayed yes
[1:24:46] amen amen amen does that make sense so I
[1:24:52] I I pray from a deep desire because I
[1:24:54] see the perfect plan of God I want to I
[1:24:57] want to achieve that I by his stripes
[1:25:00] I'm Healed I can do all things through
[1:25:02] Christ which strengthens me greater is
[1:25:04] he that is in me than he that is in the
[1:25:05] world Amen and I desire that to be
[1:25:08] manifested in my life what if I might
[1:25:10] need a healing if I might need a
[1:25:11] Deliverance if I might have a lost loved
[1:25:13] one I'm praying for them I'm praying for
[1:25:14] them I say God I I want you to bring
[1:25:17] them what you know if if truth be truth
[1:25:20] I'm saying God I'd like for you to
[1:25:22] appear them right here today as a
[1:25:23] Christian right right amen because when
[1:25:26] you love somebody and you want to see
[1:25:28] them in you don't really you're willing
[1:25:29] to wait but you don't want to wait but
[1:25:31] maybe God knows there needs to be a
[1:25:33] little bit of time he's working on
[1:25:35] something this is why perseverance not
[1:25:38] human hope but a hope that says it's
[1:25:40] already real it's already a promise and
[1:25:43] I can claim
[1:25:44] it so it it might not come exactly the
[1:25:48] way that I desired when I prayed but
[1:25:51] it's still God meeting his word brother
[1:25:53] brandham has a perfect story of that you
[1:25:56] remember the the the lady there um she
[1:25:58] was um I think she was an American but
[1:26:00] she was in Germany cuz her husband was
[1:26:02] in the Air Force and stationed there she
[1:26:05] had a baby that died and she already
[1:26:07] knew that numerous babies had been
[1:26:09] raised to from the dead in William
[1:26:11] brenham's Ministry and before Witnesses
[1:26:13] by doctor's statements they had been
[1:26:15] raised back from the dead there are some
[1:26:17] witnesses that talk about his meetings
[1:26:19] and there'd be five or six ambulances
[1:26:21] parked in a row and he would have to
[1:26:23] leave the platform and go out and climb
[1:26:25] in the back of ambulances and said
[1:26:26] nearly every one of them were already
[1:26:28] dead and when he climbed out they were
[1:26:30] alive amen so this is something that was
[1:26:32] done in the corner these are verified
[1:26:34] stories of thousands of
[1:26:36] witnesses and so when her little baby
[1:26:38] died she immediately said brother
[1:26:40] Brandon will you come I'm in Germany my
[1:26:42] husband will send a a transport plane to
[1:26:44] pick you up fly you there and bring my
[1:26:46] baby back to life and he said well
[1:26:47] sister let me pray cuz I can't decide to
[1:26:50] do that that's not perfect Faith perfect
[1:26:52] faith is persevering because you know
[1:26:55] God is and you know that whatever he has
[1:26:57] said will come to pass but however he
[1:26:59] lets that go through your life that's
[1:27:01] his Sovereign
[1:27:02] will see that's what that's what real
[1:27:05] perfect faith is that's how Jesus
[1:27:07] operated perfect Faith Jesus didn't walk
[1:27:10] around deciding who to heal he said that
[1:27:14] I the son does nothing but what he sees
[1:27:16] the father do then the son does that so
[1:27:19] that's why he comes to Betha to the pool
[1:27:21] steps over sick people heals one man and
[1:27:23] leaves
[1:27:24] you think my goodness did he not have
[1:27:27] power he had power to heal every one of
[1:27:29] them forever he had power to give them
[1:27:31] Immortal Life right there they'd never
[1:27:33] die again he had the power to bring
[1:27:34] everybody out of the Grave who had ever
[1:27:36] died but he only brought one man
[1:27:39] Lazarus he said I always do so so the
[1:27:42] whole idea of operating perfect faith is
[1:27:45] not is not elevating you in your mind
[1:27:49] that I'm up here now it's on me it's not
[1:27:51] even up to Jesus anymore it's up to me
[1:27:53] it's always up to
[1:27:55] Jesus our Allegiance is always to Jesus
[1:27:59] it's never the bride when he says she is
[1:28:01] him she she's the same as him meaning
[1:28:04] she believes the same as him she lives
[1:28:05] the same as him he did always that which
[1:28:07] pleases the father that's her
[1:28:11] desires see so you you have to keep your
[1:28:14] balance in that so when brother brandham
[1:28:18] said I'll pray and when he went to talk
[1:28:20] to the Lord about it after so many had
[1:28:23] been raised from the dead
[1:28:24] seemingly there was never even one that
[1:28:26] failed suddenly the Lord says don't
[1:28:28] touch that that's my hand I got a
[1:28:30] purpose in that leave it
[1:28:31] alone and the Lord and so brother
[1:28:34] Brandon called the sister said sister
[1:28:36] dear I'm sorry but God has refused said
[1:28:38] he's got a purpose in that I he didn't
[1:28:40] tell me what it was but that's his hand
[1:28:43] we're just going to bury your baby yeah
[1:28:45] you'll see him again you won't won't
[1:28:47] matter you're a Christian you'll see him
[1:28:48] again see it's just like it's just like
[1:28:51] you know I I I was so appreciating the
[1:28:54] story there that I I saw a a a clip just
[1:28:58] yesterday or or day before and it's
[1:29:01] where there where Jesus in The Chosen is
[1:29:04] talking I think he's talking to Big
[1:29:05] James and he Lord why haven't you healed
[1:29:07] me of this Affliction and he says
[1:29:09] because the father has decided that you
[1:29:11] can give him more Glory even by
[1:29:13] remaining in it and he says but so that
[1:29:16] you are healing other people even while
[1:29:19] you yourself Jesus was like that Jesus
[1:29:22] said to the audience he said I know what
[1:29:23] you're going to to say you're going to
[1:29:25] say physician heal yourself Jesus
[1:29:27] himself was afflicted the Bible says he
[1:29:30] learned obedience by the things he
[1:29:31] suffered amen amen so just remember it's
[1:29:35] not the it's not the you know the whole
[1:29:38] fairy tale sometimes that they tell
[1:29:39] about a Jesus story he was a real man
[1:29:43] who got tired and got hungry had a
[1:29:44] headache whatever and and and brother
[1:29:46] Bram talks about how many times he said
[1:29:48] I've prayed for hundreds of people and
[1:29:50] see every one of them healed and me
[1:29:51] standing there so sick myself I could
[1:29:54] hardly stand up amen and I love the way
[1:29:57] that uh Dallas did that and he says and
[1:30:01] he starts to turn away and he turns back
[1:30:03] and he says
[1:30:05] James you will be healed amen it's only
[1:30:09] a matter of
[1:30:12] time and that was such a a moment I
[1:30:15] thought my goodness that is true we will
[1:30:19] all come to that complete Perfection of
[1:30:21] everything that God gave you to desire
[1:30:24] every deep calling within you that
[1:30:26] believes every promise of God you'll
[1:30:28] have it it's only a matter of time am
[1:30:32] see so so she comes and then he says
[1:30:35] bury your baby well it was sometime
[1:30:38] later they're back in the US she comes
[1:30:41] to see him she says brother brandom was
[1:30:45] my faith she was you know beating
[1:30:48] herself up my faith must have not have
[1:30:51] been strong enough my faith must have
[1:30:53] not have been genuine or real and
[1:30:55] brother B said sister your faith was
[1:30:59] perfect the fact that you could take
[1:31:02] God's answer against something that was
[1:31:04] the greatest desire of your heart you
[1:31:07] couldn't have a greater desire a mother
[1:31:09] for her baby to live and he said but
[1:31:12] that you accepted the will of God in the
[1:31:14] matter prove that you have more faith
[1:31:17] than all these other people running
[1:31:18] around here who know nothing about
[1:31:20] accepting that's perfect Faith that's
[1:31:23] perseverance that's Hebrews
[1:31:26] 11 see
[1:31:29] amen so we find
[1:31:31] that that your
[1:31:34] faith Against All Odds no matter what
[1:31:37] they are against any circumstance it
[1:31:41] catches the word for your hour and
[1:31:44] refuses to let
[1:31:47] go that is real faith that something
[1:31:50] inside you that looks to the promise and
[1:31:52] you see it happening
[1:31:54] it that's that's not I hope you're
[1:31:58] taught well enough now by this
[1:32:00] 10th session by this this 10th
[1:32:04] installment I hope you're realizing
[1:32:06] enough to know that perfect faith is not
[1:32:10] mind over
[1:32:12] matter amen it's not you gritting your
[1:32:14] teeth and trying to speak something uh
[1:32:17] into existence because you want it to be
[1:32:18] so bad perfect faith is walking in the
[1:32:21] will of God no matter what it is you
[1:32:24] still know it's a promise you still know
[1:32:26] it's only a matter of time you still
[1:32:27] know it's already in existence you still
[1:32:29] know that the devil can't win you still
[1:32:31] know that you can't lose you've received
[1:32:34] the word of this hour that's perfect
[1:32:36] faith and that's what the world is
[1:32:38] opposing and that's why because they're
[1:32:40] opposing it both sides are opposing it
[1:32:43] doesn't matter who got elected both
[1:32:45] sides of the aisle oppose the Judgment
[1:32:47] of heaven and that's why this world must
[1:32:50] pass away and there's going to be a new
[1:32:52] world where Christ Christ rules and
[1:32:54] Reigns and all of the population will
[1:32:57] receive the laws of God
[1:33:01] Amen it's not mind over matter it's
[1:33:04] happening because the Deep call in your
[1:33:06] heart is contacting a reality that's
[1:33:09] already existing in God this is
[1:33:12] why in our text Faith is the substance
[1:33:17] of things hoped for the real actual
[1:33:21] evidence of Things Not Seen so gen Hope
[1:33:24] from God burning in your heart that
[1:33:28] presupposes perfect faith that it
[1:33:31] doesn't matter sometimes you think I
[1:33:33] don't I don't know if I have perfect
[1:33:35] Faith the very fact that that this that
[1:33:38] there's a hope in God and you believe
[1:33:41] his word that automatically tells you
[1:33:43] how do you think you got born again amen
[1:33:47] amen you received a revelation of Christ
[1:33:49] in the word that was the operation of
[1:33:51] perfect faith that wasn't something you
[1:33:53] could do on your own Millions walk down
[1:33:56] billions walk down and make a decision
[1:33:58] for Christ that doesn't mean they're
[1:34:00] born again you might not have even
[1:34:02] attended a meeting at all you might have
[1:34:04] been in your car driving down the road
[1:34:06] and God began to visit you and you begin
[1:34:09] to cry out for mercy and right then and
[1:34:11] there God birthed you a new and you
[1:34:13] became a new creation in Christ see so
[1:34:17] genuine hope that is operated by the
[1:34:19] Holy
[1:34:21] Spirit then we are we are we are
[1:34:23] confident that we shall have the promis
[1:34:25] made material you see because all I'm
[1:34:27] doing here here's here's where perfect
[1:34:30] faith is perfect faith says I'm here and
[1:34:36] and I I have something I need from God
[1:34:40] and I I don't have it right here but I'm
[1:34:43] hearing in the word that it already
[1:34:46] exists forward it's already real so then
[1:34:49] what's perseverance walking toward it
[1:34:53] I'm just walking all I'm doing I'm not
[1:34:55] hoping it'll come to pass I'm walking to
[1:34:58] where it already
[1:35:00] exists I'm walking to where it is you
[1:35:03] understand that I'm walking to where it
[1:35:05] is you want something from the store
[1:35:06] here you got to walk to where it is I'm
[1:35:09] it the answer is not just on the way it
[1:35:11] is already in existence it's already in
[1:35:13] a place and perseverance says just walk
[1:35:16] by faith and claim the promise and keep
[1:35:20] believing no matter what it's only a
[1:35:22] matter of time
[1:35:24] see that's true perseverance doesn't
[1:35:26] matter if it's a day two days a week a
[1:35:28] month a year however long I'm not hoping
[1:35:31] it will happen I'm persevering in faith
[1:35:34] to get to where it already is he you
[1:35:37] know you you will receive it you you
[1:35:39] have to receive it it's only a matter of
[1:35:42] time so this friends let me let me turn
[1:35:45] a corner and go to the finish line now
[1:35:47] looks like I'm going to maybe get done
[1:35:49] with this
[1:35:51] series this is exactly why
[1:35:54] in perfect faith brother brandham talks
[1:35:56] about an attitude of expectancy that's
[1:35:59] not his language that's just the the
[1:36:01] overall thought that he's trying to
[1:36:02] bring bring about that there's an
[1:36:04] attitude of anticipation a Readiness you
[1:36:08] know uh for God to move at crucial times
[1:36:12] in your life you're you're perpetually
[1:36:14] believing the word of God you another
[1:36:18] Point brother Brandon would make is that
[1:36:20] he he you know he repeatedly warns
[1:36:22] against the the det m al effects of
[1:36:24] doubt and fear you remember when Brother
[1:36:27] David was preaching Wednesday about
[1:36:29] separating from the world forsaking all
[1:36:31] amen and I it never occurred to me I
[1:36:33] wrote a note in my in my notes I told
[1:36:36] him after service at Brother David never
[1:36:38] thought about applying that to our faith
[1:36:41] because when when we when you ask God of
[1:36:44] something you have to separate yourself
[1:36:47] from all
[1:36:48] unbelief which means you deny
[1:36:50] circumstances it doesn't matter
[1:36:52] circumstan might exist here but I'm
[1:36:55] believing they're not going to exist
[1:36:57] when I get over here see so I have to
[1:37:00] separate we've got to act as if it's
[1:37:02] already done that's not psyching
[1:37:04] yourself out that's a revelation that
[1:37:08] it's in God it's in the word I'm part of
[1:37:10] the word I have a right to believe it I
[1:37:12] have a right to accept it amen see so in
[1:37:17] essence when we talk about operating
[1:37:19] perfect Faith it's about aligning your
[1:37:23] thought thoughts your words your actions
[1:37:27] with the absolute truth of God's word it
[1:37:30] involves an unwavering confidence in
[1:37:33] God's promises it it is a it is a
[1:37:38] refusal to entertain doubt and fear amen
[1:37:42] that's a choice yeah it's like you hear
[1:37:44] this the the statement happiness is a
[1:37:46] choice people choose to not be happy and
[1:37:49] there's almost nothing you can do for
[1:37:50] them happiness is a choice it it it h
[1:37:55] happiness is not based on whether you're
[1:37:56] getting everything you want or whether
[1:37:58] things are even good there are too many
[1:38:00] people down Through the Ages who have
[1:38:03] suffered and refused deliverance and
[1:38:05] they were happy in the Lord and happy to
[1:38:07] go to their death amen I mean you can't
[1:38:10] get you're not going to give me a case
[1:38:12] that exceeds that see so so we realize
[1:38:16] then that that it's a willingness then
[1:38:19] not only to refuse doubt and fear but
[1:38:22] it's a willingness to step out in faith
[1:38:24] expecting God to move that's why it's
[1:38:26] hearing recognizing and acting upon the
[1:38:29] word of
[1:38:31] God brother Brandon makes this statement
[1:38:33] and I'm I'm I'm truly wrapping
[1:38:36] up he talks about how that every
[1:38:40] creature he says I seen God baffle a
[1:38:43] bull one day I've seen him cause Hornets
[1:38:45] not to sting I seen him raise aosome
[1:38:47] from the dead Every Creature the gospel
[1:38:50] will take effect upon anything that you
[1:38:53] you ask see and so he he was using the
[1:38:57] operation of perfect love and you
[1:38:59] remember love and perfect love and
[1:39:02] perfect Faith are are like husband and
[1:39:04] wife they're married remember that so so
[1:39:07] they're they're one so he's talking
[1:39:10] about now you say oh well that bull that
[1:39:13] was going to kill him he used perfect
[1:39:14] Faith he used the the wife of perfect
[1:39:17] Faith perfect love see amen and so and
[1:39:21] and and he talks about the Hornets and a
[1:39:23] love came over him the man that jumped
[1:39:25] on the platform to to to kill him a love
[1:39:27] he said I felt sorry for him now here's
[1:39:30] what he here's a statement he made you
[1:39:33] can't manufacture you can't create that
[1:39:35] you can't fake that because the devil
[1:39:37] will know see he says it like this
[1:39:42] there's a big
[1:39:43] point something came over me
[1:39:48] yeah now do you think that's something
[1:39:53] whatever it was it tamed the bull it
[1:39:55] tamed the Hornets it tamed the
[1:39:58] murderer amen it brought the posum back
[1:40:00] to life it brought the fish back to life
[1:40:03] it brought it healed do do you think
[1:40:05] that that something that came over him
[1:40:08] could have come over him if he didn't
[1:40:11] have a life dedicated to God do you
[1:40:14] understand why I say that perfect faith
[1:40:16] is the mind of Christ operating in and
[1:40:19] through you without hindrance amen
[1:40:22] because you have sep separated yourself
[1:40:23] from the world you've dedicated yourself
[1:40:25] to a consecrated life you're in your
[1:40:27] Bible you're in prayer you're in church
[1:40:29] you're around the fellowship this is the
[1:40:32] secret to the operation of perfect Faith
[1:40:36] it's not something we're looking for
[1:40:38] coming under the seventh seal the
[1:40:40] seventh seal simply revealed to us it
[1:40:42] restored to us the truth that it had
[1:40:43] been since Genesis and this is what
[1:40:46] Joshua operated to stop the sun this is
[1:40:49] what this is what Elisha used to float
[1:40:51] an axe head on water this is what job
[1:40:54] used to overcome his trials he used this
[1:40:58] Revelation I'm preaching to you about
[1:41:01] that that that that it was all in God's
[1:41:03] hands and that he was part of God and he
[1:41:06] said I know my redeemer liveth at the
[1:41:08] last day I'll see him that's part of his
[1:41:10] Revelation amen his perseverance kept
[1:41:14] going so there's so much to live for
[1:41:17] friends there's so much of the Eternal
[1:41:19] to be had and enjoyed I want to say that
[1:41:22] to you as we get ready to wind up here
[1:41:24] there's so much to be had and enjoyed
[1:41:26] I'm not talking somewhere over a rainbow
[1:41:28] I'm not talking somewhere under some
[1:41:30] great mystery sermon I'm talking about
[1:41:32] it's available to you right now to live
[1:41:35] above the world to cast out fear
[1:41:37] separate yourself from unbelief and and
[1:41:40] let God move in your lives I promise
[1:41:43] this world that is rejecting his
[1:41:45] judgment you're going to have to be able
[1:41:47] to operate that or you're not going to
[1:41:50] survive it you're not going to
[1:41:53] you won't you won't survive
[1:41:57] it
[1:42:02] amen let's
[1:42:14] stand let me read you this quote from
[1:42:16] perfect
[1:42:19] faith and then I can say I'm officially
[1:42:22] finished with this series I made it how
[1:42:25] about
[1:42:30] that perfect
[1:42:32] Faith August 25th in the evening service
[1:42:35] remember the morning service how can I
[1:42:39] overcome and he says in the evening
[1:42:41] service in perfect Faith this is coming
[1:42:43] into that third poll I'm believing it
[1:42:47] now I want to ask you a sincere question
[1:42:51] you that passed through the prayer line
[1:42:54] you can actually did he just say prayer
[1:42:58] line and he's talking about did he just
[1:43:00] put the third poll in the prayer line in
[1:43:02] the same sentence did he just put
[1:43:04] perfect faith of prayer line in the
[1:43:05] third pole in the same sentence yeah see
[1:43:09] see how silly that argument is can you
[1:43:12] actually believe and feel now that there
[1:43:13] is something happened in you since
[1:43:15] you've had hands laid on you and he says
[1:43:18] raise up your hand there it is this is
[1:43:20] what we've waited for now this is not
[1:43:23] this is just starting to bloom now this
[1:43:26] 1963 this is just start starting to
[1:43:29] bloom now see I just started with I did
[1:43:32] this for a purpose I did this for a
[1:43:34] purpose I'm working out something see
[1:43:36] it's taking this charge of faith and
[1:43:38] going right back to begin and come in
[1:43:40] see to kind of raise faith in a bracket
[1:43:43] where you've never noticed it that way
[1:43:45] before not a
[1:43:47] faith but a perfect Faith Build It Up
[1:43:52] build it up in here I love this and
[1:43:56] watch a perfect god with a perfect heart
[1:44:00] keep a perfect Promise by his perfect
[1:44:03] word it's sharper than any two-edged
[1:44:05] sword discerner of the thoughts of the
[1:44:07] heart what we're coming now to the
[1:44:12] Perfection
[1:44:14] because the
[1:44:16] people has to come to this in order for
[1:44:22] the
[1:44:24] Rapture that's what's holding it away
[1:44:27] right now is waiting for that church to
[1:44:31] come into that perfect raptured Faith
[1:44:33] looking for it listen what he says now
[1:44:36] you're going to now you're going to hear
[1:44:37] him explain why he started the that
[1:44:40] Sunday this is his second sermon on that
[1:44:42] Sunday in August now you're going to
[1:44:45] hear
[1:44:46] him verify why he started the thought
[1:44:49] with how can I
[1:44:51] overcome he says
[1:44:53] that's what's holding it away right now
[1:44:55] is waiting for that church to come into
[1:44:56] that perfect raptured Faith looking for
[1:44:57] it here it is it means a lot of Shaving
[1:45:00] down for me it means a lot for you but
[1:45:04] together we'll make it by the grace of
[1:45:09] God bow your heads with me
[1:45:13] today Lord I feel satisfied in my
[1:45:18] spirit and I I think I see clearly the
[1:45:21] direction that you're moving in
[1:45:24] Lord I I pray today and I I committed
[1:45:28] myself to you before coming out here
[1:45:30] because it seemed strange the way you
[1:45:32] wanted me to deliver this today you
[1:45:35] wanted me to just be very methodical go
[1:45:38] slow take your time say it
[1:45:41] clear I I I kept I kept taking my foot
[1:45:45] off the gas when I felt myself moving
[1:45:48] too high in a preaching gear I just
[1:45:50] backed down lord I wanted these
[1:45:53] statements to be clear and concise in
[1:45:56] the people's minds I want them to have a
[1:45:59] clear understanding of it Lord and why
[1:46:01] we need it in our lives and it's going
[1:46:04] to take a lot of Shaving
[1:46:06] down if a prophet said that about him
[1:46:09] it's certainly true about me and these
[1:46:11] folks here today I pray Lord God that I
[1:46:14] I I I don't want to stand up here and
[1:46:16] say oh Lord God pour down your spirit
[1:46:19] and your power and let us operate the
[1:46:21] impossible I I want to say Lord help me
[1:46:24] to have a shaving down today help us
[1:46:27] Lord God men and women boys and girls
[1:46:29] teenagers single married oh let's raise
[1:46:32] up our hands to him friends and say Lord
[1:46:34] whatever it takes whatever you have to
[1:46:36] shave off of my life how can I overcome
[1:46:39] I've got to be willing to be shaved down
[1:46:42] by the word of God I've got to be
[1:46:44] there's no sense fooling myself anymore
[1:46:47] we're not waiting for something over a
[1:46:49] rainbow the end of all things is upon us
[1:46:51] and is at hand Lord we want to have that
[1:46:54] Dynamic Spirit flowing through us
[1:47:00] unhindered I know that there's things in
[1:47:03] my
[1:47:05] life that have hindered and would
[1:47:07] continue to hinder but I want I and I
[1:47:11] know there's and if that's true about me
[1:47:12] it's true about these people and Lord
[1:47:15] that being the case we're not trying to
[1:47:17] hide and be arrogant we're trying to say
[1:47:20] Lord help me help me oh God have mercy
[1:47:23] upon me give me that power if if I want
[1:47:27] a power give me this power that that I
[1:47:30] would be willing to lay aside every
[1:47:33] weight and sin that death so easily
[1:47:35] beset us so that we can run this race
[1:47:39] with patience grant that to us Lord that
[1:47:42] would be the greatest thing that you
[1:47:44] could do for us Lord perfect Faith isn't
[1:47:47] about me walking around do trying to
[1:47:50] snap my fingers and do the supernal
[1:47:52] natural it's about like you did you did
[1:47:55] always that which pleased the Father the
[1:48:00] prophet taught us in perfect faith that
[1:48:02] you were able to operate it on two
[1:48:03] principles number one you knew who you
[1:48:05] were we've spent a lot of time
[1:48:08] solidifying who we are in Christ that if
[1:48:11] we didn't just become a Son of God we
[1:48:13] had always been children of God that
[1:48:16] revelation of who she is is how she'll
[1:48:19] do the Greater Works we're taught that
[1:48:21] it's how she becomes an in ible Army but
[1:48:23] the other prerequisite
[1:48:26] was Lord that you had no condemnation in
[1:48:31] your heart you said Satan
[1:48:34] cometh but he has no claim on me he
[1:48:37] findeth nothing in me there's nothing in
[1:48:39] my life I do always that which pleases
[1:48:41] the
[1:48:43] father Lord may you help us to come into
[1:48:46] a place in our lives where we
[1:48:48] can move aside the things out of our
[1:48:51] life out of our home we know what they
[1:48:53] are we're we're standing here in this
[1:48:55] building right now mortal beings and our
[1:48:57] heads are bowed and our eyes are closed
[1:48:59] we know what they are we know what they
[1:49:02] are maybe we have other people around us
[1:49:05] fooled but we can't get away from our
[1:49:07] own understanding of the things in our
[1:49:10] lives that we allow in our lives and it
[1:49:12] hinders perfect Faith from
[1:49:15] flowing I pray Lord God that if this
[1:49:17] series will accomplish anything not to
[1:49:19] just teach us what it is and how to
[1:49:22] operate it but but that it will cause a
[1:49:24] great desire to be in our hearts Lord I
[1:49:27] just raise up both my hands today in a
[1:49:29] fresh surrender and I ask you grant that
[1:49:31] to us Lord God that's the desire of our
[1:49:33] heart today that we would be ready and
[1:49:36] willing to move in all ways of your word
[1:49:39] moving aside things whatever it takes to
[1:49:42] be laid aside may we as Paul said lay
[1:49:45] aside the weights and the sins that do
[1:49:48] so easily beset you so you can run this
[1:49:51] race with patience that's not rocket
[1:49:53] science Lord I think every man woman boy
[1:49:56] and girl understands exactly what that
[1:49:59] means father I commit it to you now I
[1:50:02] commit this series into your hands it's
[1:50:04] been a long one I've enjoyed it I thank
[1:50:06] you for the things we've learned it's
[1:50:08] definitely Lord been become a Hallmark

[1:50:14] something that I I I wanted for years to
[1:50:17] understand better so I thank you for
[1:50:19] that I commit myself I commit these
[1:50:22] people into your hands that you'll do
