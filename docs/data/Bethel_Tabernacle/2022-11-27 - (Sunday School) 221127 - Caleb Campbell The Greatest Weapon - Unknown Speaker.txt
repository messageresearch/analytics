TRANSCRIPT
========================================
lines and we process thoughts within our minds so the Battleground is our thought process so what lays in your thought process this morning amen what things are you thinking about you know we have we have the pressures of Life we've got to think about what we're gonna you know you know what we're gonna eat later we've got to think about you know our job next week we've got to think on those things but when we come through those doors you know just on a Sunday or a Wednesday you know are we entering into an atmosphere or our minds still so fixated on the things of the world and not on the things of God that we can't even get anything from the word I heard a message not too long ago and it just really opened my eyes to a different view that I hadn't really noticed before and they were talking about you know you know how the phone is used for you know everything nowadays you know we use it for school we use it for work you know social media WhatsApp Google and none of those things you know as a whole is bad as long as you become masters of it but what happens is you know some of us even use it as our alarm clocks I mean I do um and it's just so the nature of the Beast is is that's the first thing that I look at in the morning because it's what wakes me up and you know we may be we may use it like we have our tablets we may use it to listen to a message we may use it for the Bible but what happens is you know when something pops up we get a text message or you know we have a notification pop up then our thought process begins to think upon the things of that even though like like we were talking about in the scripture that it's not so much unlawful for that but then our mind is now no longer fixated on what God wants us to be fixated on we're thinking about even if it's something so simple as you know your wife asking you to do something or um probably that's a bad example but even if it's so simple as as you know someone just sending you an encouraging text message you know then you're thinking about those and you're thinking about a reply that you want to that you want to make and you're no no longer being able to enter in into what you were doing into the message you were listening to into the Bible verses you were reading maybe even you're praying but in the back of your mind you're still pondering on what you were scrolling through just a few minutes ago and last week we touched on not being ignorant of the devices that Satan uses in our lives you know and many times the devices are just really simply to keep your mind on the things of the world and the things of life and to keep you away from your full potential you know and I asked myself I ask myself this this question and the answer that I got was that I came to was shocking you know how many times have I been praying or have I been reading my Bible even in just the last few weeks and my mind is just completely on something else I mean and we can all ask ourselves that question that's what I want to do this morning we can ask ourselves that question how many times have I been just reading the word and I'm not even paying attention to what I'm reading I'm just having a thought of what else is going on in my life or what this may be a text message or maybe I had scrolled through Facebook or or maybe and like I said those things aren't bad but it's how we control those things is it controlling us or are we controlling it and we can't enter into what God wants for us if we're so thinking on those things and I was just I was shocked when I came to that answer because it's multiple times you know I've just been praying and you know even trying to enter in in prayer and just the thoughts of life just coming amen it really hinders one of your greatest weapons that you have talking on prayer this morning it can really overcome every aspect of your prayer lives if you aren't as Ephesians 6 says praying with all prayer and supplication in the spirit amen the scripture teaches us we need to pray in the spirit and watch there unto it says with all perseverance and supplication for All Saints and I really like how the Amplified Bible puts it it says that with all prayer and petition pray with specific requests at all times on occasion and every season in the spirit with this in View and it says to stay alert with all perseverance and petition interceding in prayer for all God's people are we staying alert this morning when we're praying are we staying alert and keeping our minds on the things of God when we're trying to enter in to his atmosphere into his presence or are we so thinking on the things of life we need to stay alert Colossians 4 picks up it says in Colossians 4 2 it says be persistent and be devoted to prayer be alert bring being alert and focus in your prayer life with an attitude of Thanksgiving we have that attitude of Thanksgiving and if we can pick up in our Bibles uh in familiar scripture again but first Samuel the first chapter the first chapter first Samuel chapter 1 and verse 10. we read of a woman um talking about that Colossians 4 2 being persistent and devoted in prayer alert and focus we read of a woman of faith in the Old Testament who sought God through prayer and supplication this is a familiar uh Sunday school teaching on Hannah but um we're just going to read it and she says and she was in bitterness and prayed unto the Lord and wept sore and she vowed a vow and said O Lord of hosts if thou will indeed look on the Affliction of mine handmade and remember and not forget thine handmaid but will give unto thine handmaid a man-child then I will give unto the Lord all the days of his life I will give him unto the Lord all the days of his life and there shall no razor come upon his head and it came to pass as she continued praying before the Lord that Eli marked her mouth now Hannah she spake in her heart only her lips moved but her voice was not heard therefore Eli thought that she had been drunken and Eli said under how long will thou be drunken put away thine wine from me and Hannah answered and said no my Lord I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink but have poured out my soul before the Lord that's the way to pray to pour out your soul before the Lord count not thine handmade for a daughter of Belial for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken here hitherto then Eli answered and said go in peace and the god of Israel Grant thee Thy Thy the petition that thou Hast ask of him and she said let thine handmaiden find Grace in thy sight so the women woman went her way and did eat and this is what I want to focus on and her countenance was no more sad her countenance was no more sad that's what prayer is supposed to do you know when you're discouraged you go before the Lord as Sam as um as David did and encouraged himself in the Lord that is something that we all have the the access to the ability to do if we just go before the Lord and he'll be faithful to Remember You and John 14 teaches us that have faith in whatever we ask in the name of the Lord and whatever ye shall ask in my name that will I do that the father may be glorified in the son so when we go to our knees and we pray like Hannah does and travail with great needs and with great supplication we also need to have the expectation that when I stand back up that it's already done and we would we should just use these scriptures use Hannah as an example in our lives that we should go forth we may start with a sad countenance but when we encourage ourselves in the Lord we get on our knees and we pray and we just drown out the things of the world and we just enter into that atmosphere she had confirmation in her heart and she was no longer of a sad countenance that's that's we have access to that this morning and we have access to that anytime we pray anytime we go to the Lord Spurgeon picks uh prayer up and he says he who lives without prayer he who lives with little prayer he who seldom reads the word and he who seldom looks up to heaven for a fresh influence from on high he will be the man whose heart will become dry and barren my goodness I don't want my heart my heart to become dry and Barren however he who falls in secret on his God who spends much time in holy retirement who Delights to meditate on the words of the most high and whose soul is given to Christ such a man must have an overflowing heart as his heart is such will his life be and I was just kind of in fellowship with my dad not too long ago and we're just talking about you know the difference in listening and reading and sometimes sometimes it's better to read because we're able to stop and pause and really think on these things we're able to think on okay my goodness that that's something so beautiful you know and if we're listening and listening is still a great tool that we can use I know that that's sometimes all we can do but if we're reading we can get so much more out of it because we can pause and we can say Lord will you just show me what exactly that means there's so many compound meanings within the scriptures and and Lord just show me what this means and show me how I can apply it to my life and show me these things and the Lord really just been dealing with me on just such a simple and just a basic level just get back to the basics with things Caleb you know in sports when you're young or whatever you know it's all about the fundamentals the key the fundamental uh key to a life hidden in Christ is a tried and true prayer life and I was checked in my heart When I Was preparing for this and I was writing this question out how often do you flee away I'm just asking myself this question if we could just all ask ourselves how often do we flew away from the hustle and the bustle of Life of our phone and of the stress and of the pressures and make time to pray in secret as this passage in Matthew teaches us you know it's just a basic lesson but let's get back to the basics let's get back to the fundamentals of things praying shouldn't just be something we read about in the Bible praying shouldn't be something that we just do in church or that we hear about in church it's got to go further than that if we don't know how to pray you know and that's okay sometimes we don't know how to pray that's that's okay this the prophet of God didn't know how to pray when he first started he picks this up he says did you ever walk like that light-footed why I remember that night I was back when I first got saved and went back into a little old shed I never did pray in my life and I was going to write Jesus a letter and Tack it on a tree so out in the woods so he could find it I didn't know how to pray I thought he'd pass by that tree sometime and let me tell him that letter what a dirty guy was or how low down or how unworthy if he's a man he'd talk like a man so I didn't know how to talk and I just knelt down on an old grass sack and an old wet shed and began to fool with my finger and I said Mr Jesus will you come here just a minute now this is just pouring out his heart this is just simple I I just want to talk to you he says but he come that's the main thing he'll meet you you don't know how to pray just have a sincere heart kneel before the Lord and He will come that's the main thing I think if we would quit rhyming our prayers he says today and trying to tease someone here tease someone's ears and pray from the depths of our heart like an old-fashioned sinner ought to repent then God would hear us amen too much of this put on Pharisee told you the other day Pharisee means an actor too many Pharisees quit putting on I don't like that stuff put on be what you are be original God knows what you are anyhow you're only acting before someone else he knows what you are original even even if you just need to get back to those fundamentals he wants something original he he knows that each of our personalities are different he knows that I don't pray like you do and he knows that you don't pray like he does or she doesn't pray he knows that but we have we enter into a personal relationship with God just like you enter into a personal relationship with with someone you love and you don't just go you know I I don't just go to my wife and tell her what I need every day or she's that wouldn't be any kind of a relationship you know we we commune together we we we walk together we walk this life together and that's the same exact way that he wants to be with us he already knows we read that he already knows what we have need of but it's in those times of secret prayer that he'll meet you and really speak with you we speak a lot and when we pray we're groaning but if we just can enter into that secret place with the Lord then he can begin to speak to us amen I can't remember who was ministering it might have been brother Jason on some number of weeks ago but to have the kind of experience in prayer where the Lord actually communes with us and goes you know like like Moses in the mountain where you know he had this bush and the bush talked back to him you know it was that's the kind of communion that I long for the Lord to just talk back to me amen you know I think we've all been guilty of this a time or two you know that the only prayer that we really offered up to the Lord you know in a day maybe even five minutes I've been guilty I'll just raise my hand if nobody else is just telling him of our needs right and not saying that you shouldn't tell him of your needs but it's got to go further than that amen brother Jason was saying uh last Sunday I believe he's already mindful of all of our needs he's already mindful of your financial needs he's mindful of the pressures of life but what what you really and truly sacrifice your time to the Lord he'll he will meet you in that place and what an honor it is that the Creator of Heaven and Earth would meet you in a secret place and would commune with you what a beautiful picture that is amen and as that quote was saying when we begin to think on those things and we get to really get our minds off of the world and just setting our phones down or setting setting our life down and just entering into that prayer what a what a time I don't want to be complacent in my prayer life uh you know we're we are like I said at the beginning we're fighting a battle and we need to be engaged in it complacency is finding yourself in a place where you're not engaged in it you're you're there you're just there I don't want to just be here I want to be engaged in the battle we can't we can't sit back with Idle Hands and like Matthew saying and let our weapons become dull by sharpening by only sharpening with just a few minutes of prayer you know it becomes a dull blade then says the scripture says blessed are they that hunger and thirst for they shall be filled amen one commentator was was writing on the story in Acts 12 where the Believers were praying interceding for prayer while he was in prison and he said in that scripture acts 12 5 but prayer but prayer is the link that connects us with God this is the bridge that spans every Gulf and bears us over every abyss of danger of need how significant the picture of an Apostolic Church Peter imprisoned the Jewish term Supreme the arena of martyrdom awaiting the dawning of the morning to drink up the apostles blood and everything else against it but prayer was made unto God without ceasing and what was the sequel the prison opened the apostles free the Jews baffled the wicked King eaten of worms a spectacle of hidden retribution and the word of God rolling on in Greater Victory praise God do we know the power of our supernatural weapon the commentator says and do we dare to use it on the author of a faith that commands as well as asks God baptized us with holy audacity and Define divine confidence he is not wanting great men but he is wanting men who will dare to prove the greatness of their God but God but prayer amen he's wanting to men and women not great I'm not great we're not great but we serve a great God who can do many great things amen and that's my desire this morning he goes on to say that God that prayer is are God's opportunities his opportunity to bring us further into a maturity in him his opportunity to give you a greater experience he's he's wanting that for you he's wanting you to be further mature in his word he's wanting to to bring you to a greater place he's just waiting on you because he's a gentleman I love just the next this this next scripture Jeremiah 33 it says call to me and I will answer and tell you and even show you Great and Mighty things things which have been confined and hidden which you do not know and understand and cannot distinguish he wants to show us Great and Mighty things and he desires communion with you he just wants to separate ourselves he wants us to separate ourselves a little bit so that he can meet us in that quiet place amen he just once as we talked on last one last Sunday he just wants a willingness to yield and a sacrifice of just some things in our life sacrifice of of a little bit of time and it's really just such a beautiful thing um come into a close here I don't want this to be like a New Year's resolution you know that we say that we're going to go and do better and then just forget about it I I just want to even start even if it's just something small to take back a little bit of that precious that precious time that that even even that the hustle and bustle of just you know looking at our phone and just putting that down for a few minutes and really entering into prayer maybe just read uh reading a chapter or two of your Bible to be able to separate your mind from the things of the world before you enter in and really devote tried and true time to getting back to the fundamentals of a Christian walk and do a steadfast on your knees seeking a closering walk with God in your prayer life if we could just stand together to our feet this morning and that verse in uh versus nine of Matthew 6. he says after this manner therefore pray ye Our Father which art in heaven Hallowed be thy name Hollywood that that word Hollywood means made holy or consecrated greatly revered and honored let us always be like Esther before he enters in before she enters in to the presence of the king and dedicate yourselves and come in with a reverence in our hearts that this is this isn't just you know it is your brother and is your friend but this is also your king amen let us just Revere and honor our King this morning let's just go before the Lord Heavenly Father Lord we're so grateful and thankful Lord just for another opportunity Lord Jesus to to Proclaim your word Lord this this precious gospel Lord Jesus we're thankful for or just a little bit closer of a walk with you this morning Lord and we dedicate now we dedicate Our Time Lord to think on these things to think on the things of of of the word of God and let it just Lord plant a seed in our hearts this morning and and bring us into a further state of maturity Lord Jesus I pray for the musicians I pray for the song leader I pray for the past the minister the pastors he comes out father pray your anointing would be just so close this morning Father God and Lord I just thank you for these people and I dedicate them all now and and give them unto you now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen God bless you Saint seem to be seated um
