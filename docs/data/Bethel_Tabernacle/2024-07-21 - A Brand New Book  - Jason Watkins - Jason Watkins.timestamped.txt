[37:29] give all of our singers a hand amen our
[37:32] worship
[37:33] team praise the name of the Lord sure
[37:36] enjoying that worship brother Tony had
[37:39] me out of my chair on the first song I
[37:43] hardly could sit back down I was about
[37:44] to have run away praise the Lord but I
[37:47] got to work today so i' get back to get
[37:52] back to it amen
[37:53] so praise the Lord God bless you we're
[37:56] going to invite you right away
[37:58] um into the scripture this morning and
[38:02] um you know I I have a kind of um in in
[38:07] a certain way let me say it this way in
[38:09] a certain
[38:10] way um definitely have a brand new
[38:15] sermon so we definitely have that I
[38:17] don't um I don't at all not taking um
[38:22] you know any anything more Gideon was
[38:23] asking me this morning said Papa we got
[38:25] part 17 coming I'm like no no we uh we
[38:28] finished it amen in the 16 Parts last
[38:31] time but um I have something that's
[38:34] special on my heart and the reason that
[38:36] I say that it's special is
[38:40] because that it's it's studying a sermon
[38:44] that brother Brandon preached which
[38:45] you're all very very familiar with the
[38:48] future
[38:49] home of the Heavenly bridegroom and the
[38:51] Earthly bride and um I told sister
[38:55] sweetheart today as we were driving to
[38:58] church I said I said honey how old am I
[39:01] she said she thought for a minute she
[39:03] said 60 and I said how many times
[39:07] because she heard me listening to it and
[39:08] I said how many times would you
[39:11] imagine in fact as when we got in the
[39:13] car to drive brother Brandon was just
[39:15] finishing out with a song and closing it
[39:17] out a long sermon and I said how many
[39:20] times you imagine I've heard that
[39:22] song probably a lot and I said yep you
[39:26] wouldn't be wrong I said going all the
[39:28] way back to my childhood when sister
[39:30] Jean played the tapes for the whole
[39:33] neighborhood amen with all the windows
[39:35] open and that reel to reel as fast as
[39:38] one reel run out another reel got put on
[39:41] so uh growing up listening to that

[41:33] second Peter chapter 3 this morning want
[41:36] to go right here and catch uh from this
[41:40] great
[41:41] Apostle here in second Peter I used to
[41:44] know where second Peter
[41:47] was thank you sir right after first
[41:50] Peter appreciate that
[41:54] Mo amen right before third Peter
[42:02] amen I was in a in a church service one
[42:04] time big packed out church and the
[42:06] Pastor said we want to invite everybody
[42:07] to turn to the 23rd chapter of
[42:11] Revelation and Men sister Jean were the
[42:14] only ones who didn't reach for our Bible
[42:16] the whole church was you know looking
[42:18] where in the world and she looked at me
[42:20] and smiled real big and I felt happy to
[42:22] be well instructed in in the scripture
[42:25] amen second Peter chapter 3 and we're
[42:28] going to catch verses 1 to 18 and then
[42:33] I'll probably let you be seated uh as we
[42:36] read Revelation because this is
[42:39] lengthy The Second Epistle beloved I now
[42:43] write unto you in both which I stir up
[42:45] your pure Minds by way of
[42:47] remembrance that you may be mindful of
[42:50] The Words which were spoken before by
[42:52] the holy prophets now you we started
[42:54] with the words of the Holy prophets in
[42:58] Isaiah right where he says I'm going to
[43:00] make Jerusalem a rejoicing I'm going to
[43:02] make her people a joy right amen all
[43:06] right by the holy prophets and of the
[43:08] Commandment of us the Apostles of the
[43:10] Lord and Savior knowing this first that
[43:13] there shall come in the last days
[43:16] scoffers walking after their own lust
[43:18] and saying where is the promise of his
[43:21] coming for since the fathers fell asleep
[43:25] all things contined as they were from
[43:28] the beginning of the creation so when
[43:32] you think like that you stop
[43:35] watching and we were commanded to watch
[43:38] and wait and be ready and keep till he
[43:40] comes but when you remember Jesus said
[43:43] but when the people realized that he
[43:45] seemed to delay then they just went on
[43:47] about their business remember when Moses
[43:49] was gone a long time and the people rose
[43:51] up to play so this is this is the danger
[43:55] that when you follow this kind of Spirit
[43:57] on the age and it's on the whole age to
[44:00] just to get you to think man nothing's
[44:03] really changed I've heard the Lord's
[44:04] coming my whole life be careful see
[44:08] because I'm today I'm come with a
[44:10] revelation that I know the very hour he
[44:14] coming the hour you think
[44:21] not for this they willingly are ignorant
[44:25] of that by the word of God the heavens
[44:28] were of old this is prior to the to
[44:30] Noah's destruction and the Earth
[44:32] standing out of the water and in the
[44:34] water this is the Genesis world whereby
[44:36] the world that then was now Here Comes
[44:39] the Flood being overflowed with water
[44:41] perished but the heavens and the Earth
[44:44] which are now by the same word are kept
[44:46] in store reserved under Fire against the
[44:49] day of judgment and predition of ungodly
[44:51] men but beloved be not ignorant of this
[44:54] one thing that one day is with the Lord
[44:57] as a thousand years and a thousand years
[44:59] as one day the Lord is not slack
[45:02] concerning his promise as some men count
[45:04] slackness but his longsuffering to us
[45:06] were not willing that any should perish
[45:08] isn't that lovely but that all should
[45:11] come to repentance so after all it's
[45:14] just the patience and love of God is why
[45:17] we're still
[45:18] here but the day of the Lord will come
[45:22] as a thief in the night first of all
[45:24] because people have stopped looking for
[45:26] it they've let their guard down in the
[45:29] which the heavens will shall pass away
[45:32] with a great noise and the elements
[45:35] shall burn with fervent heat the Earth
[45:37] also and the works that are therein
[45:39] shall be burned up seeing then that all
[45:42] these things shall be dissolved
[45:45] everything you chase in this world it's
[45:48] all going to Ash and
[45:50] Cinder see so where are your priorities
[45:54] what is it you're chasing what is it
[45:55] you're trying to accomplish are you
[45:57] living this life as if it's about this
[46:00] life please this life is not about this
[46:03] life it's about the one that Peter's
[46:06] writing about here the one coming see
[46:09] but the day of the Lord that's always
[46:12] judgment will come as a thief in the
[46:14] night in the which the heaven shall pass
[46:17] away with a great noise the elements
[46:20] shall melt with fervent heat the Earth
[46:22] also and the works that are therein
[46:24] shall be burned up seeing then that all
[46:28] these things shall be dissolved what
[46:30] manner of persons ought ye to be in all
[46:33] holy conversation and godliness that's a
[46:36] fair question wouldn't you say seeing
[46:38] that all these things are passing away
[46:40] and they're going to be destroyed with
[46:41] fervent heat will and he's going to come
[46:43] as a thief in the night and it's going
[46:44] to happen then what what kind of person
[46:48] ought we to be looking for and hastening
[46:51] un the coming of the day of God wherein
[46:54] the heavens being on fire shall be
[46:56] dissolved and the elements shall melt
[46:58] with fervent heat
[47:00] nevertheless we according to the promise
[47:02] look for now this is the third iteration
[47:05] of the world nevertheless we according
[47:09] to his promise look for new heavens and
[47:11] a new Earth wherein dwelleth
[47:13] righteousness wherefore beloved seeing
[47:15] that you look for such things be
[47:17] diligent that you may be found of him in
[47:19] peace without spot and
[47:21] blameless and account that the
[47:24] longsuffering of Our Lord is salvation
[47:26] even our beloved brother Paul also
[47:29] according to the wisdom given unto him
[47:30] ha written unto you as also in all his
[47:34] Epistles speaking in them of these
[47:35] things in which are some things hard to
[47:37] be understood which they that are
[47:40] unlearned and unstable rest as they do
[47:42] also the scriptures unto their own
[47:45] destruction so when you when you refuse
[47:48] the messenger to your age that's that
[47:50] doesn't end well verse 17 you therefore
[47:53] beloved seeing you know these things
[47:56] before
[47:57] beware lest ye also being led away with
[48:01] the error of the wicked fall from your
[48:03] own steadfastness now he's not saying
[48:05] losing your
[48:06] salvation you're suddenly unborn again
[48:09] but there is the ability if you don't
[48:11] stay on your toes to lose your
[48:13] steadfastness in what in in all holy
[48:17] conversation and
[48:19] godliness see you lose your
[48:21] steadfastness but now here's here's
[48:23] here's what you do grow in Grace how
[48:28] many say Amen to that grow in Grace
[48:33] growing in Grace doesn't mean that I'm
[48:36] understanding Grace more so I can live
[48:38] looser Grace the Bible says Grace
[48:42] teaches us to deny
[48:45] ungodliness see all right so don't don't
[48:48] turn Grace into a misuse of Grace and
[48:51] make it a
[48:53] disgrace but growing grace and in the
[48:56] knowledge of our our Lord and Savior
[48:58] Jesus Christ to him be glory both now
[49:02] and uh forever amen all right now you
[49:06] can be seated and we're going to read
[49:08] from
[49:10] Revelation um
[49:14] 21 Revelation 21 you're going to see
[49:19] that everything I'm reading is all the
[49:21] same theme I move that back a little bit
[49:23] Brother Brad because I could hear the
[49:25] wind noise hitting it
[49:27] so all right now we want to catch vers
[49:31] Revelation 21:
[49:33] 1:5 and I saw a new Heaven and a new
[49:37] Earth for the first Heaven and the first
[49:40] Earth were passed away and there was no
[49:43] more sea and I John saw the holy city
[49:47] the New Jerusalem coming down from God
[49:50] out of Heaven prepared as a bride
[49:53] adorned for her
[49:55] husband so
[49:57] first thing I want you to notice is the
[50:00] the
[50:01] correlation of the city with the
[50:05] bride and and he he's he's making them
[50:09] together in fact is when the angel who
[50:11] had the seventh
[50:13] vial said I will show you the bride the
[50:17] Lamb's wife and he saw a
[50:19] city so you can see that they are
[50:21] correlated together now that's going to
[50:23] mean a lot as we go forward
[50:27] and I John saw the holy city New
[50:30] Jerusalem coming down from God out of
[50:33] Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for
[50:35] her
[50:36] husband and I heard a great voice out of
[50:39] Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of
[50:44] God is with men and he will dwell with
[50:48] them and they shall be his people and
[50:52] God himself God
[50:55] himself God himself
[50:57] himself the first time in the Bible it's
[51:00] saying this it's never been God himself
[51:04] it's always in an office he's always in
[51:08] the in an angel Joshua met him as a
[51:11] soldier Gideon met him in a certain way
[51:14] Moses met him in a certain way this is
[51:16] the same God that said I Moses I can't
[51:19] go down in the midst of these people
[51:20] because they're stiff necked and
[51:22] rebellious plus the fact that there's no
[51:24] blood sacrifice of the Lamb of God so
[51:27] even the righteous people would get SL
[51:29] slaughtered he said I can't dwell among
[51:31] you but I'll send my angel see I'll come
[51:34] in an office I'll come in a form to
[51:36] where I'll come in a Ministry to where I
[51:39] I can be among you and Lead You and I
[51:42] can I can push off judging you I can
[51:44] push it off I can push off judgment
[51:46] waiting for the Lamb of God because my
[51:49] eventual idea is to dwell with you and
[51:53] be in you amen all right now
[51:57] watch and they behold the Tabernacle of
[52:00] God is with men and he will dwell with
[52:03] them and they shall be his people and
[52:05] God himself shall be with them and be
[52:07] their God and God shall wipe away all
[52:10] tears from their eyes and there shall be
[52:13] no more death neither sorrow nor crying
[52:17] neither shall there be any more pain
[52:19] Hallelujah for the former things are
[52:22] passed away and he that sat upon the
[52:25] throne this is quite an image he that
[52:28] sat upon the throne said behold I make
[52:32] all things new and he said unto me right
[52:35] for these words are true and
[52:40] faithful amen
[52:45] now I I I intentionally did not put any
[52:50] quotes on PowerPoint today because I
[52:52] first of all I don't want to get bound
[52:54] to them I I want to as
[52:57] as Katie my daughter-in-law says I want
[52:58] to Freestyle a little bit amen so but
[53:01] I'm going to read through them and and I
[53:03] really only have one that I'm going to
[53:05] read at length um but I but I I want to
[53:08] try to get this first concept to you now
[53:11] this is the very first important point
[53:13] that you're going to understand and as
[53:16] many times as I read over this to me the
[53:19] future home of the of the Heavenly
[53:22] bridegroom and the Earthly bride was
[53:23] just telling me about the city I'm going
[53:25] to go live in and I preached on it and
[53:27] did a and did a a a a diagram and showed
[53:30] you know modeled the Holy Mountain on
[53:32] the earth and showed you a picture of
[53:34] the globe with that on it and we
[53:35] measured the square miles and the and
[53:38] the and you know I forget how many seven
[53:42] you know seven million or more seven I
[53:45] think 7.3 million square miles of of
[53:50] land and something like 4.5 billion
[53:53] acres of land so that's just the city
[53:57] see because its base is is 1500 miles by
[54:01] 1500 miles so so it it's all the way
[54:04] from you know from Maine to Florida and
[54:07] west of the Mississippi and you know up
[54:09] to the Canadian border so it's a big
[54:11] chunk of land like half this nation and
[54:14] so and that's going to rise up higher
[54:15] than the space shuttle flies the space
[54:17] shuttle today I'm sorry the
[54:19] International Space Station orbits at
[54:22] the at the
[54:24] Foothills level of this mountain this
[54:28] thing's High way way up there I mean it
[54:32] it's going to need new atmosphere around
[54:34] it amen so the whole earth will be
[54:37] lighted by by the by the that Pillar of
[54:40] Fire hanging in the top of it Jesus the
[54:42] light of the world so so now I thought
[54:46] you know that it's it's just all about
[54:48] that however watch watch what how
[54:51] brother Brandon almost like an opening
[54:53] volley he first he starts cover ing uh
[54:57] this is out of paragraph 73 74 75 76 77
[55:01] 78 I'm just skipping along it you can
[55:03] find and study at home it's a great
[55:05] message you're going to want to listen
[55:06] to it after today especially and so so
[55:09] we we find that he goes right to where
[55:12] we read in our scripture that there was
[55:14] a world the Genesis world that stood out
[55:17] of the water then that world got an
[55:21] deluvian destruction but that that world
[55:23] didn't pass away you understand it just
[55:26] got drowned you know everybody except
[55:28] eight Souls uh lost their lives and then
[55:31] he says to Noah the very thing he said
[55:34] to Adam now now multiply and replenish
[55:37] so we find then that that's the world
[55:40] that has survived to now and we're still
[55:44] living since the flood to now so we're
[55:48] in the second iteration of the same
[55:50] world and then brother brandham says you
[55:53] know he starts talking about how the old
[55:54] world that stood out of the water
[55:56] the one that is present that we live on
[55:59] and he said and then the world to come
[56:02] so that's three worlds or three stages
[56:06] of the world so he he he's showing that
[56:10] now because remember that our that a big
[56:13] point is that the city is the bride and
[56:15] the bride is the city and they correlate
[56:18] so now he's going to say look that
[56:21] you've got the world the Earth and
[56:24] you're built out of the Earth
[56:27] understand so just like you had to come
[56:30] by the three works of Grace amen through
[56:34] water blood and spirit see and so you
[56:38] were you were baptized and then you and
[56:41] that's justification you're baptized
[56:43] then there's sanctification it's all the
[56:45] work of the Holy Ghost but then there's
[56:48] that fiery baptism that actually brings
[56:50] the gene of God to life now because now
[56:55] we explain it that way way because of
[56:58] the way He restored the ages okay so we
[57:01] a lot of times I'm I'm sorry I'm going
[57:03] have to take my jacket off because the
[57:06] um the back device got broken that pins
[57:09] it to my collar and I can feel it
[57:10] tugging on me it's going to distract me
[57:12] the whole time so amen all right praise
[57:16] the Lord amen so so we find
[57:21] that that he says now it's water blood
[57:26] life that's the way a baby comes water
[57:29] breaks blood then life see and so you
[57:33] have to come through those three works
[57:34] of Grace and as I was saying we explain
[57:37] it almost like a a process that you've
[57:41] got to go through and because we're
[57:43] we're correlating that to How He
[57:45] restored the word down Through the Ages
[57:47] many people get the they they think too
[57:50] too much on that first I need to repent
[57:53] and get Justified and then the next
[57:55] thing I need to do I'm not quite born
[57:57] again yet I've repented but now I got to
[57:59] go get baptized well I'm still not born
[58:01] again now I got to get Sanctified and
[58:03] then if I live Sanctified long enough
[58:05] and I do a good enough job and get an A
[58:07] on my report card then he'll give me the
[58:09] Holy Ghost and the token and the and the
[58:12] baptism and the new birth but but we
[58:15] only are describing it that way because
[58:18] that's the way the Ages were restored
[58:21] but the new birth all of those are to
[58:24] come in a moment amen when when it's
[58:27] when it's really the holy ghost moving
[58:30] and compelling you and he has broken
[58:33] your heart and you repent of your sins
[58:36] it's not just a repenting of your past
[58:38] sins it's a literal repenting of
[58:40] everything you have been everything you
[58:42] are and you don't want to be you anymore
[58:45] you want to be him you're tired of the
[58:47] world and it's genuine and it's real and
[58:50] when you I'm here to tell you you don't
[58:52] have to wait 10 days you don't have to
[58:55] wait 10 hours you don't have to wait 10
[58:58] seconds you can come to Christ and the
[59:01] baptism of the Holy Spirit Will justify
[59:04] and sanctify and make you a new creation
[59:07] in Christ Jesus it's not hard to get the
[59:10] Holy Ghost is not hard to get young
[59:12] people but the reason people don't get
[59:14] it is because they only have a partial
[59:17] repentance they don't really they're not
[59:20] they don't really surrender everything
[59:22] and the reason they don't really
[59:24] surrender everything is because they're
[59:25] not not
[59:27] willing to give up
[59:31] everything and when that's the condition
[59:33] of your heart that's the that's where
[59:35] brother Bram talks about the Box Car see
[59:38] the box car is not your report card how
[59:40] how well are you are you making the
[59:42] great it's your heart when he sees that
[59:45] inside that heart that that's not real
[59:47] faith that you're holding back you'll
[59:50] never be born again you'll come to
[59:52] church you'll be a better person you'll
[59:54] live a Sanctified life but but I'm here
[59:56] to tell you your desires of your heart
[59:58] it'll still be just you gritting your
[1:00:01] teeth trying to be a Christian CU you
[1:00:02] don't want to go to hell and you don't
[1:00:04] want to go on a tribulation and you'd
[1:00:06] very much like to go to this new city so
[1:00:08] would I no kidding so would everybody
[1:00:11] but I'm here to tell you you've got to
[1:00:13] have a fiery baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:00:17] and that's why when he baptized it in
[1:00:20] water in Noah's day God himself still
[1:00:23] couldn't dwell on the earth it wasn't
[1:00:26] fit for him to dwell in even when Jesus
[1:00:29] blood ran down the cross and touched the
[1:00:31] Earth and Sanctified it he still
[1:00:34] couldn't do it and even in the
[1:00:37] Millennium it's not God himself dwelling
[1:00:39] with us it's Christ Jesus you understand
[1:00:42] but you don't get to Revelation 21 until
[1:00:46] there is not a not an atomic fire at the
[1:00:49] end of the tribulation but a holy fire
[1:00:52] at the end of the
[1:00:53] Millennium and then it's a f place for
[1:00:57] God himself to dwell upon with his
[1:01:02] people amen amen this is Brother
[1:01:06] branham's opening volley what God has
[1:01:09] done to redeem his world he's done the
[1:01:13] same plan to redeem his
[1:01:16] people and you need to get that right
[1:01:19] off the bat three stages of
[1:01:24] Grace We're very
[1:01:26] familiar and fond of quoting in
[1:01:29] paraphrase because few people quote it
[1:01:31] verbatim paraphrases close enough how
[1:01:35] that brother brandham after the seals
[1:01:36] talks about his Bible becoming a brand
[1:01:39] new book and that's true he said that
[1:01:42] that's true but but I I I want to
[1:01:45] broaden your mind to understand that
[1:01:49] that wasn't in his mind that wasn't a
[1:01:53] one-off brother brandham had been making
[1:01:55] that statement for years depending on
[1:01:58] what was
[1:02:00] happening the earliest instance I could
[1:02:02] find was
[1:02:04] 1955 and what he's referring to is is
[1:02:08] the New Birth by a spiritual Revelation
[1:02:12] and so he says it's been it's been ever
[1:02:14] since once he ever gave a spiritual
[1:02:18] Revelation to the 120 people in the
[1:02:21] upper room and and they accepted that
[1:02:24] and when they and when they and then and
[1:02:26] then they were baptized in the Holy
[1:02:28] Ghost and then when Peter preached to
[1:02:29] these to all these these devout Jews and
[1:02:33] he gave them the word of the hour not
[1:02:35] the word they had they had had the word
[1:02:37] they were devout Jews they had the law
[1:02:38] of Moses but now he gave them the
[1:02:41] message of the hour which is the Lamb
[1:02:43] has come you killed him but God would
[1:02:46] not allow him the grave couldn't hold
[1:02:48] him for David had said I'll not leave
[1:02:49] his soul in hell and this same Jesus who
[1:02:52] you crucified has been made both Lord
[1:02:55] and Christ and when they heard that
[1:02:57] message what must we do why did they ask
[1:02:59] that cuz they were concerned why were
[1:03:01] they concerned cuz they believed it and
[1:03:04] when they and they said what's the
[1:03:05] message of the hour repent and be
[1:03:08] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and
[1:03:12] when they followed that then the church
[1:03:13] was added to daily and they got the Holy
[1:03:16] Ghost and the evidence that they got the
[1:03:18] Holy Ghost is in verse 441 that after
[1:03:21] they were baptized they continued
[1:03:24] steadfastly with the apostles teaching
[1:03:26] and doctrine of the breaking of
[1:03:30] bread so the new birth isn't hard to
[1:03:35] identify it's when you can say Amen to
[1:03:37] every
[1:03:38] word and so he says it was a spiritual
[1:03:42] re Revelation from God this is 1955 the
[1:03:45] glorified Jesus and it's been ever since
[1:03:50] spiritually revealed truth how God in
[1:03:53] his Mercy through the operation of the
[1:03:55] Holy Spirit
[1:03:56] reveals the truth the word itself if
[1:04:00] you're trying to read it if you're
[1:04:03] trying to read it from some educational
[1:04:06] standpoint you just read it like you was
[1:04:09] trying to figure out mathematically
[1:04:13] something but if you read it after you
[1:04:16] have received Christ in your heart it's
[1:04:19] a brand new book
[1:04:26] he goes on 1956 contending for the faith
[1:04:30] he starts talking about when he was uh
[1:04:34] in Jerusalem and he he met a bishop of
[1:04:37] the Methodist Church brother brandham
[1:04:39] you know we don't accept you as a
[1:04:40] missionary because you westerners y'all
[1:04:42] don't know how to read the Bible it's an
[1:04:43] Eastern book and he starts talking about
[1:04:45] this you people in the west with your
[1:04:47] Western education does not understand
[1:04:48] the scripture and the right of an
[1:04:50] oriental book and that's true brother R
[1:04:52] says with all of our theology if you
[1:04:54] ever go to Jerusalem or to the Eastern
[1:04:57] country and he starts talking about in
[1:04:59] the in the or he's got one here I'm
[1:05:00] going to read next where he's in India
[1:05:02] and and India is part of Asia and so he
[1:05:05] says he says when you go there to the
[1:05:08] Eastern country where the Bible was
[1:05:11] written it's a brand new book to you so
[1:05:15] now it's tied to an event you understand
[1:05:18] it's tied to a happening so so so when
[1:05:22] he says you've been born again that's a
[1:05:24] happening not brand new book when you
[1:05:27] actually go to the east where it was
[1:05:28] written and you understand it by the
[1:05:31] culture that you're you're mingling
[1:05:32] around in I any brother in here that has
[1:05:35] been to the to Israel can tell you that
[1:05:39] this took on new meaning in so many
[1:05:41] places everybody of ever Christian have
[1:05:43] ever heard that went there come back and
[1:05:44] said I understand my Bible so much
[1:05:47] better
[1:05:49] now so he comes in 1960 Queen of Sheba
[1:05:52] he's in Bombay India they're trying to
[1:05:54] tell him that you know that same that
[1:05:56] same appeal and he agrees with it he
[1:05:59] says that it's an Eastern book If you
[1:06:01] ever go to the east it becomes a brand
[1:06:03] new book when you read it up here in the
[1:06:04] west we try to make an Eastern book
[1:06:06] compared with the Western way of living
[1:06:08] you can't do it he's talking about a lot
[1:06:10] of those types and shadows you don't
[1:06:12] understand what's happening in the
[1:06:14] Bible 1962 now's progressing along and
[1:06:18] I'm skipping a bunch of them and I'm
[1:06:19] just reading pieces of quotes 62
[1:06:23] questions and answers he says look back
[1:06:25] when I look back where I once was now
[1:06:28] I'm above that why because his grace
[1:06:30] Lifted Me Up you say Amen you remember
[1:06:32] that day and here I am now seated in
[1:06:35] Heavenly places in Christ oh my there
[1:06:38] you are now that's a listen friends that
[1:06:41] very scripture has such depth of meaning
[1:06:45] because he's saying this standing in a
[1:06:47] pull pit on the Terra Firma he's
[1:06:50] standing on Earth saying now that I'm in
[1:06:53] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus
[1:06:56] and that's where you are you're sitting
[1:06:57] here in a building but you're but
[1:06:59] there's another you that's in Heavenly
[1:07:02] places in Christ Jesus and I would say
[1:07:04] when you've been born again of the
[1:07:05] spirit of God it's the more real
[1:07:09] you say so some some part of me is way
[1:07:12] off beyond the Milky Way stop thinking
[1:07:14] of it as somewhere beyond the misty blue
[1:07:18] the Bible said he's right here near
[1:07:20] right here around all of us he's not far
[1:07:22] from any of you it's just dimensional
[1:07:25] it's just dimensional it's not it's not
[1:07:27] Multiverse like the science fiction
[1:07:28] writers think it is it is in a sense but
[1:07:31] it's dimensional
[1:07:32] layers
[1:07:34] see so so he says here when I look back
[1:07:38] at what I once was now I'm above that by
[1:07:40] his grace he Lifted Me Up and here I am
[1:07:43] now seated in Heavenly places in Christ
[1:07:45] oh my there you are then the Bible
[1:07:48] becomes a new book then you're reading
[1:07:51] it through spiritual eyes and spiritual
[1:07:54] understanding amen
[1:07:56] so now don't lose sight of the fact that
[1:07:57] I'm preaching on today my title is a
[1:08:00] brand new book all right so here he
[1:08:03] comes now um 1964 the identified Christ
[1:08:07] of all ages until you come in behind the
[1:08:10] badger skin nice you know correlating
[1:08:13] with the Tabernacle in the wilderness in
[1:08:16] the wilderness that Moses
[1:08:18] erected until you come in behind that
[1:08:21] Badger
[1:08:22] skin I suppose the temple as well until
[1:08:26] you get out of your old skin your old
[1:08:29] thoughts your old Creeds friends don't
[1:08:33] claim you are born again if you're still
[1:08:35] got your old thoughts your old Creeds if
[1:08:38] you haven't died to you you're never
[1:08:41] been born to
[1:08:42] him
[1:08:46] Hallelujah if you not come behind that
[1:08:49] and and you still have your old skin and
[1:08:51] your old thoughts and your old Creeds
[1:08:54] here's his advice come into the presence
[1:08:57] of God and then when the word becomes a
[1:09:00] living reality to you what does that
[1:09:03] even mean it means that it's it's no
[1:09:05] longer on printed page it's not ink on
[1:09:08] paper it's the word behind skin that
[1:09:12] this has become a reality inside of you
[1:09:15] and you're now the Living
[1:09:17] Word when that has happened see when the
[1:09:20] word becomes a living reality to you
[1:09:23] then you're awakened to the Shina Glory
[1:09:26] the thing nobody else
[1:09:28] sees they think you're weird they think
[1:09:30] it's Ault they don't see it as Shina of
[1:09:32] Glory that's why they think that you
[1:09:35] wouldn't see it as Shina of Glory either
[1:09:37] but you've went behind the
[1:09:39] veil and a supernatural thing has
[1:09:42] happened and your eyes have been
[1:09:45] opened thank you
[1:09:47] Lord so what the world looks at as weird
[1:09:50] and strange and cult and as a cult you
[1:09:53] look at it as the shikina glob
[1:09:56] Glory then the Bible becomes a new book
[1:10:00] then Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[1:10:04] today and
[1:10:07] forever finally he comes
[1:10:11] here in 1965 power God's power to
[1:10:16] transform this is the one people often
[1:10:19] refer to people that feel the same way
[1:10:22] that I do and the way I have been for
[1:10:25] many years but since the opening of
[1:10:28] those Seven Seals of them Angels just
[1:10:31] behind the mountain Yonder this meaning
[1:10:34] his Bible this has become a new book
[1:10:38] it's the things that's been hidden
[1:10:40] that's been hid is being revealed as God
[1:10:44] promised in Revelation 10 that he would
[1:10:46] do it's not just
[1:10:51] Doctrine people ate the book and became
[1:10:55] the book it's not just Doctrine you
[1:10:58] might not even understand all of the
[1:11:01] doctrines but the the the the Christ is
[1:11:04] not a book He's a person the message is
[1:11:07] not books and tapes and quotes it's a
[1:11:10] person it's
[1:11:13] Christ you you where's the where's the
[1:11:16] Book of Life where's where's the open
[1:11:18] book it's in the bride because she's
[1:11:21] eaten the
[1:11:23] book invisible Union and this is
[1:11:25] actually the last one I have in that
[1:11:27] vein 1965 now your old book now here
[1:11:30] here's the reason I got this one now
[1:11:32] we're going all the way and this is
[1:11:34] going to work for you in the in the long
[1:11:37] this is the long
[1:11:38] game when you've been born
[1:11:41] again when you were born in the earth
[1:11:44] your name was put in the book of
[1:11:47] life right it's a book of names it's
[1:11:50] every name that's ever existed and even
[1:11:53] if there's a few scant names and brother
[1:11:55] brandham talks about maybe like
[1:11:57] Pharaoh it's ambiguous what that means
[1:12:00] we don't know for sure but brother
[1:12:02] brandham does also go on to say even
[1:12:04] though his name wasn't in the book he
[1:12:05] said I'm sure there was a record of him
[1:12:07] somewhere because life is precious to
[1:12:09] God and so so we realize that your name
[1:12:13] was in The Book of Life Now on the
[1:12:16] Judgment when you know when the when the
[1:12:19] one is seated there the one that Isaiah
[1:12:21] saw him high and lifted up and his
[1:12:25] filled the temple in Isaiah 6 right
[1:12:27] right amen Daniel comes through Daniel 7
[1:12:30] Daniel 9 that Daniel 11 all these
[1:12:31] teachings and he says I saw the Ancient
[1:12:34] of Days Seated on the throne So Daniel
[1:12:36] sees him amen so so you you this is the
[1:12:40] same exact one this is now now we find
[1:12:44] that John comes and John says uh in that
[1:12:48] he sees a throne and he said I saw one
[1:12:51] seated on the throne Hallelujah and then
[1:12:54] we read it in our text he sat on the
[1:12:56] throne you remember in in Revelation 20
[1:12:59] that the the the the heavens peeled back
[1:13:03] the the dead both small and great stood
[1:13:06] before him remember that and the books
[1:13:08] were opened and another book was opened
[1:13:10] which was the book of life and the dead
[1:13:12] were judged out of the by their works
[1:13:14] out of the books and then after that
[1:13:17] then after because if you look Matthew
[1:13:20] 25 and Revelation 20 agree in their
[1:13:24] sequence because the first ones he's
[1:13:26] speaking to is the is the righteous who
[1:13:28] are who were not born again but they're
[1:13:31] being judged by their works out of the
[1:13:33] books and they were found to be
[1:13:35] righteous works the foolish virgin and
[1:13:38] those different ones and then they're
[1:13:40] placed on the right and then next come
[1:13:42] the next one and they get put on the
[1:13:44] left because they're they're being
[1:13:46] judged by their works also but their
[1:13:48] Works according to the books are found
[1:13:50] to be works of iniquity
[1:13:53] yeah see and so then then the Bible says
[1:13:57] that all whose names were not found in
[1:13:59] the book were cast into the Lake of Fire
[1:14:01] where death and hell and the Beast and
[1:14:03] the devil and the false prophet are and
[1:14:06] and the new heavens and the new earth
[1:14:08] begin in Earnest so so you've got this
[1:14:10] one seated on the throne and and and
[1:14:13] this judgment is going now the Bride As
[1:14:16] I said to you last time she's part of
[1:14:18] the processing crew she's part of the
[1:14:20] team she's on the throne she's already
[1:14:23] been fully vetted and her identity was
[1:14:25] found to be in
[1:14:27] Christ so he says your old book now this
[1:14:30] is when you're born again this is not
[1:14:32] then this is now when your old book is
[1:14:35] gone with your old Union remember Paul
[1:14:39] covers that in Romans 7 I speak to them
[1:14:42] that know the law how that a woman
[1:14:43] having a living husband if she be
[1:14:45] married she shall be caught an
[1:14:46] adulterous but if her husband be dead
[1:14:48] then she's no longer under that and
[1:14:49] she's free to remarry right so now your
[1:14:53] old Union your old Union that you were
[1:14:55] born with that Fallen birth that you
[1:14:58] came into the world with no chance at
[1:15:00] all to save yourself no matter how good
[1:15:03] you would ever be there's value in being
[1:15:06] good but that can't give you eternal
[1:15:07] life you understand you have to be given
[1:15:10] by eternal life given eternal life by
[1:15:11] the only one who can give it and he's
[1:15:14] the source of eternal life he is eternal
[1:15:16] life he's that same
[1:15:18] Fountain before he ever said let there
[1:15:20] be light and the heavens and the Earth
[1:15:22] were created that Fountain was in
[1:15:23] existence
[1:15:25] amen so so he he says here your old book
[1:15:29] now is gone with your old
[1:15:33] Union your name in your old has been
[1:15:37] transferred now you say do you mean to
[1:15:39] tell me that my old book brother B says
[1:15:44] God put it in the sea of his
[1:15:47] forgetfulness you stand perfectly before
[1:15:53] God now your name
[1:15:55] is now in the new book not the book of
[1:15:58] life but the Lamb's Book of Life what
[1:16:01] the lamb redeemed not the old book of
[1:16:04] your natural Union but your new bride
[1:16:08] Hallelujah your new life is in the
[1:16:10] Lamb's Book of Life your marriage
[1:16:12] certificate where your true Eternal germ
[1:16:15] from the beginning takes hold see you
[1:16:18] always had it but when you're born again
[1:16:20] it takes hold see now you're not only
[1:16:23] forgiven but you're Justified and we
[1:16:25] know what that means as as though you
[1:16:27] never did it in the first place as if
[1:16:29] you had never been born in
[1:16:33] sin so your your record then becomes you
[1:16:38] know it's not it looks like two books
[1:16:39] brother the ROM clears it up later it's
[1:16:41] not two books it's one book it's dis
[1:16:43] sectioned and so therefore whatever was
[1:16:46] held against you in the in the book of
[1:16:48] life is now gone it's gone it's gone and
[1:16:52] the only identity of you that remains
[1:16:55] is Jesus Christ because it's the Lamb's
[1:16:58] Book of Life and you're when they look
[1:17:00] at you they identify you as him I
[1:17:03] identify as Jesus Christ and his bride
[1:17:08] Hallelujah like to say to the world I
[1:17:10] identify as the bride of Christ I would
[1:17:13] only ask that you respect me and support
[1:17:16] me in my
[1:17:19] identity man
[1:17:21] confirm you accept
[1:17:23] it we might get
[1:17:29] along so now when you look at when you
[1:17:33] look down through the history of the
[1:17:37] Bible the Bible you know you remember
[1:17:40] Paul talks about those old Veterans of
[1:17:42] the Old Testament era and he said you
[1:17:45] know they were for our examples these
[1:17:48] things were written for our admonition
[1:17:50] so that we could learn we could not only
[1:17:53] learn you know understand the god that
[1:17:56] we know better because now we can see
[1:17:58] him in Shadow and we can understand how
[1:18:01] we got to where we are because we can
[1:18:03] see him getting there back here in their
[1:18:06] lives this is why you can find an Old
[1:18:08] Testament character if you get in a
[1:18:10] problem just go see how they got out of
[1:18:12] the same problem and however God had
[1:18:15] dealt with them he'll deal with you so
[1:18:18] when we we can see Abraham and we can
[1:18:21] see that Abraham was called of God but
[1:18:24] it's it's a little hard to focus on when
[1:18:26] he's when he when a famine strikes the
[1:18:29] land and this prophet of God who God
[1:18:32] Called to be the father of Nations and
[1:18:34] the father of Faith suddenly gets scared
[1:18:37] and leaves the promised land and goes
[1:18:39] down to Egypt and anytime a Jew leaves
[1:18:42] the promised land he's
[1:18:44] backslid see and so you find even
[1:18:47] Abraham now showing a backsliding
[1:18:50] condition he's down there he's lying to
[1:18:53] Pharaoh he's getting his wife to lie CU
[1:18:55] that thing passes on to the generations
[1:18:58] after you and and and and now she's
[1:19:01] she's part of the lie and part of the
[1:19:03] scheme and he almost dies he almost
[1:19:05] loses her they pick up you know here
[1:19:08] here they pick up Hagar this Egyptian
[1:19:10] slave and as I've said for years Israel
[1:19:13] is still paying for that one to this day
[1:19:16] they're paying for that one and so you
[1:19:19] find that of course God used it it has
[1:19:20] to be contrast Ishmael had to come
[1:19:22] forward and then he's going to persecute
[1:19:24] the the the promised child and so you
[1:19:27] you know the story and then you find
[1:19:30] that you say okay well that was just one
[1:19:31] little fauxie Abraham will never do that
[1:19:33] again and he didn't until he got in
[1:19:35] trouble again and then that ticking time
[1:19:38] bomb that is in him because he was born
[1:19:41] in sin that's in you when you're born in
[1:19:43] sin and all that ticking Time Bomb all
[1:19:46] it is a pressure bomb and all it needs
[1:19:48] is for you to get enough pressure and
[1:19:50] it'll blow and you think you've beat it
[1:19:53] and you think you've conquered it just
[1:19:54] get under enough pressure one time get
[1:19:57] in the wrong place let your prayer life
[1:19:59] get slacked let your church schedule get
[1:20:00] slacked let your fellowship get get
[1:20:02] slack and you'll find out that this old
[1:20:05] flesh still has lots of time bombs
[1:20:07] they're ticking time bombs just waiting
[1:20:09] for the right opportunity thanks be to
[1:20:12] God you don't have to fear him because
[1:20:14] greater is he that's in you than he
[1:20:16] that's in the
[1:20:17] world and the Holy Ghost has the ability
[1:20:20] because there's a new me on the inside
[1:20:22] which is really him as me and now it can
[1:20:25] bring these ticking time bombs under
[1:20:27] under
[1:20:31] control and so Abraham there he is again
[1:20:34] with ailec and he's lying again same old
[1:20:36] lie same old fear same old thing almost
[1:20:40] dies almost lose his wife the whole
[1:20:42] thing goes sideways on him and and you
[1:20:45] know the the story I don't need to spend
[1:20:47] all this time on it but you're going to
[1:20:49] find that when you follow that in
[1:20:51] Genesis then the king mzc comes to in
[1:20:55] the cool of the evening it says about
[1:20:57] this time according to the time of life
[1:20:59] I'll visit you you know Sarah laughed
[1:21:01] why'd she laugh I didn't yes you did you
[1:21:03] said this but you shall indeed have a
[1:21:06] son and when he had that son now you've
[1:21:09] got a new office now it's not just
[1:21:11] Father Abraham now God has moved in his
[1:21:14] Bible imagery into sunship and now the
[1:21:17] very promise is starting to take hold
[1:21:20] and once sunship came on the scene
[1:21:22] Abraham never made that mistake again
[1:21:25] I'm here to tell you once the Son of God
[1:21:27] comes into your life and into my life
[1:21:30] Abraham became a new book and you become
[1:21:33] a brand new
[1:21:36] book Jacob did the same thing followed
[1:21:39] his dad they're all lying they're
[1:21:42] shyers he I I loved that sermon uh
[1:21:46] brother Caleb preached recently my
[1:21:48] goodness spoke to me so deeply on Jacob
[1:21:53] and you know and brother B talks about
[1:21:54] man when you're goingon to you really
[1:21:55] got to have some Grace well about
[1:21:57] believing Jacob to be in the lineage of
[1:21:59] Christ it really going to take some
[1:22:01] Grace cuz this guy was all time lying
[1:22:04] conniving cheating scheming Prophet
[1:22:06] calls him a
[1:22:08] Shyer and but you know something and and
[1:22:11] this was the point that that that Caleb
[1:22:14] was making and and I just was listening
[1:22:16] to a tape right as he had preached that
[1:22:18] and I was listening to a tape and
[1:22:20] brother Brandon was talking about that
[1:22:21] very thing how that finally he got a
[1:22:24] hold of he said for one time in his life
[1:22:27] he had an experience something he could
[1:22:29] get his hands on something he had had
[1:22:31] experiences with God he had made a
[1:22:35] pillow and he saw angels ascending and
[1:22:37] descending and a ladder attached from
[1:22:38] Heaven to Earth and he saw the Son of
[1:22:40] God standing there talking to him he had
[1:22:43] all kinds of things but he still goes
[1:22:45] from there and still lying and still
[1:22:46] cheating but I'm here to tell you
[1:22:48] finally he come to an
[1:22:50] experience and it changed him it wasn't
[1:22:53] just another experience it wasn't just
[1:22:55] another church service it wasn't just
[1:22:57] another good sermon it wasn't just
[1:22:59] another time at the altar but something
[1:23:01] for the first time could alter his life
[1:23:05] and he became a prince he became a new
[1:23:07] book called The
[1:23:10] Prince called
[1:23:13] Israel same thing with
[1:23:15] Moses he became a new book after he was
[1:23:18] a runaway Prophet
[1:23:20] yeah brother bandam said all he had to
[1:23:22] show for his calling was one dead
[1:23:25] Egyptian in the sand rotting and
[1:23:28] stinking and he's standing there on and
[1:23:31] he says he's thinking about his life
[1:23:33] here he is and he says I thought he says
[1:23:36] Moses I'm glad a prophet can look back
[1:23:38] and catch that inspiration and he said
[1:23:40] one day Moses stood there and he thought
[1:23:42] about his life and what what
[1:23:44] opportunities he had had and squandered
[1:23:47] and blew it and he says and now I'm old
[1:23:49] now I'm 80 years old now it's too late
[1:23:52] it's too late for me I've wasted too
[1:23:54] much time got too much baggage here I am
[1:23:57] I'm supposed to be a deliverer my people
[1:24:00] are still in bondage I'm just a simple
[1:24:02] sheep harder and and and and he says
[1:24:05] brother I'm says and great Crystal tears
[1:24:07] began to roll down his beard and he said
[1:24:10] then he heard the sound of that
[1:24:11] crackling flame and he looked to see and
[1:24:14] he said I'll turn aside oh turn aside
[1:24:17] today friends you can become a brand new
[1:24:19] book you can meet with God like you've
[1:24:22] never met with him before that's my
[1:24:25] prayer I pray that after even after
[1:24:28] brother Caleb preached that I started
[1:24:29] praying saying Lord give me an
[1:24:31] oldfashioned refilling of the Holy Ghost
[1:24:34] something I can put my hands on at a
[1:24:36] level I've never known say you've been
[1:24:38] in this a long time you've had some
[1:24:40] levels you're right I've had some levels
[1:24:42] but I want a level that I've never known
[1:24:45] I want that fresh dynamics that fresh
[1:24:47] surge of the holy ghost in my
[1:24:51] life I thought it was falling out here
[1:24:53] this morning when brother Tony started
[1:24:55] with that
[1:24:56] song I started to run out the door it's
[1:24:59] here hallelujah i' had have probably
[1:25:02] jumped from here to the back
[1:25:03] door Peter became a brand new book All
[1:25:06] Through the Bible you can read these
[1:25:08] people that they became a brand new book
[1:25:10] now he's not he's not denying he's not
[1:25:13] swearing he's not angry he's not got a
[1:25:15] temper he's standing there humbly
[1:25:17] believing God's word and the Holy Spirit
[1:25:19] so comes upon him when they go to
[1:25:21] crucify him his he has a request not
[1:25:25] spare my life but please don't crucify
[1:25:27] me like my Lord why not because I'm not
[1:25:30] worthy to die like he did what do you
[1:25:32] want us to do I want you to turn me
[1:25:34] upside down and crucify me upside down
[1:25:36] I'm here to tell you Peter was a brand
[1:25:38] new book after the opening of the word
[1:25:42] the Bride of this day has been given a
[1:25:45] brand new book to feed on and after the
[1:25:48] opening of the word in this day the
[1:25:50] Bride of this day the bride has become
[1:25:53] herself a brand new
[1:25:57] book around the world she's become a
[1:26:00] brand new book I'm here to tell you
[1:26:02] something friends that's a that's a book
[1:26:04] for the ages a book for eternity think
[1:26:06] about it just think about what God has
[1:26:09] done to this bride predestinated to
[1:26:12] become a brand new book predestinated to
[1:26:14] become a living Bible you you yourself
[1:26:18] predestinated to be a Living Word at the
[1:26:20] end time you in your very person
[1:26:26] you see you're not marked for
[1:26:27] Destruction that's right many B billions
[1:26:33] are marked for
[1:26:35] Destruction even the good the unwise
[1:26:39] Virgin and the remnant of the woman's
[1:26:40] seed even they'll go down in that
[1:26:43] terrible time we we were talking about
[1:26:46] some of those issues last Sunday and in
[1:26:49] the 16th part of that
[1:26:51] series but I am not marked and I I I
[1:26:54] want I want me to know
[1:26:56] it I'm not marked for Destruction I'm
[1:27:00] predestinated to not fall I'm ordained
[1:27:03] to stand there Hallelujah I'm not marked
[1:27:06] for Destruction I'm predestinated to
[1:27:08] live in a brand new world I'm ordained
[1:27:11] to live in a brand new city is that how
[1:27:13] you feel
[1:27:19] today in our opening text of Isaiah
[1:27:24] for
[1:27:25] behold I create a new
[1:27:28] heavens and a new
[1:27:30] Earth and the
[1:27:32] former shall not be remembered nor come
[1:27:37] in to
[1:27:39] mind there's quite a bit
[1:27:42] of pain and
[1:27:44] heartbreak in this life we
[1:27:49] live and the devil has seen to
[1:27:52] it that he has been able to
[1:27:56] maximize every weakness and in
[1:28:00] your armor we try to be
[1:28:04] Christians even even with the Holy Ghost
[1:28:06] we still stumble we still make mistakes
[1:28:09] imagine how we were before we had the
[1:28:11] Holy Ghost
[1:28:14] amen I just think people should once
[1:28:17] they get off their high horse don't ever
[1:28:19] get on him
[1:28:21] again see Paul talks about about like
[1:28:24] Paul says you know of the things that
[1:28:26] you put your members to back then things
[1:28:28] you don't even want to speak
[1:28:30] of and a lot of pain and a lot of
[1:28:33] heartbreak and a lot of loss there's
[1:28:36] been tremendous loss we've all
[1:28:38] experienced it here today and any one of
[1:28:41] us could stand up and and give a story
[1:28:44] of great pain and suffering and
[1:28:46] tremendous loss that we've suffered and
[1:28:48] some stories would be worse than others
[1:28:50] and some would would take minutes for
[1:28:52] you to start crying and some you'd cry
[1:28:54] almost immediately that life has been
[1:28:57] hard life and job said it's just a few
[1:29:00] days it's full of Sorrow it's full of
[1:29:03] trouble don't don't chase this world no
[1:29:05] wonder Jesus said don't lay up Treasures
[1:29:08] here lay them up there see if you lay
[1:29:11] them up here then thieves can take them
[1:29:13] moth and rust can corrupt them but put
[1:29:16] them somewhere Hallelujah put them
[1:29:18] somewhere beyond the beyond the sun
[1:29:21] beyond the clouds put them somewhere
[1:29:23] friends where they're safe put them
[1:29:25] somewhere where you'll find them again
[1:29:27] in that new
[1:29:30] world been quite a bit of pain quite a
[1:29:33] bit of heartbreak and
[1:29:35] I I I I can give you this word of
[1:29:38] comfort today for a heartbreak that
[1:29:41] you've had for a heartbreak that may
[1:29:43] await you
[1:29:45] still the
[1:29:47] former shall not be
[1:29:49] remembered nor come into
[1:29:52] mind oh oh for that hour oh for that day
[1:29:57] when all sorrow is over and all pain is
[1:30:00] done and all loss I'll never lose
[1:30:03] anything again often times loss can
[1:30:06] bring numbing anguish it can bring
[1:30:09] bewilderment and we can sit sometimes
[1:30:11] and just stupified can't even speak the
[1:30:14] anguish of the loss is so great but he
[1:30:17] says be glad and rejoice forever in that
[1:30:21] which I create for behold I create
[1:30:24] Jerusalem are
[1:30:25] rejoicing and I create her people of Joy
[1:30:28] I know we've had pain but joy is coming
[1:30:31] Hallelujah I know we've had loss but
[1:30:33] it's going to be new again Hallelujah
[1:30:36] he's bringing that back to us friends
[1:30:39] that's what the word has restored to us
[1:30:42] in this
[1:30:46] hour watching the clock let me just
[1:30:48] catch a few more points I don't know if
[1:30:50] I'll finish this today it's doubtful
[1:30:55] he says
[1:30:59] here he says in these passages nice
[1:31:02] meaning where we read in Peter heavens
[1:31:04] and earth will pass away remember that
[1:31:07] and it all dissolved with a fervent heat
[1:31:09] and I saw a new Heavens in the new Earth
[1:31:10] remember that really dire language my
[1:31:13] goodness it just sounds like total
[1:31:15] annihilation of everything but brother
[1:31:17] brandham is going to point out that the
[1:31:19] Earth and I don't have that particular
[1:31:21] quote here but the Earth is an eternal
[1:31:23] attribute of God
[1:31:24] and therefore it can never be
[1:31:25] annihilated see so now
[1:31:28] remember that city is you and you are
[1:31:31] that City and there's a you and there's
[1:31:33] that City that you're going to live in
[1:31:35] it and it's going to be on an earth that
[1:31:38] can't be annihilated because there's a
[1:31:40] part of you that can't be annihilated
[1:31:44] amen he says with these passages one
[1:31:47] might think or be led rather to
[1:31:50] believe that the whole planet of this
[1:31:53] Earth will be destroyed speaking about
[1:31:55] Peter's
[1:31:57] language I make a new Heaven and a new
[1:32:01] Earth see that the heavens will be
[1:32:05] gone the Earth will be gone completely
[1:32:08] annihilated but a close study and with
[1:32:12] the help of the Holy Spirit we can see
[1:32:14] the truth of this and that's what we're
[1:32:16] going into it is only the atmospheres
[1:32:20] around it and the sin that's upon the
[1:32:23] Earth Earth that will be destroyed see
[1:32:27] now we realize that the heavens means
[1:32:30] the atmospheres above see so what does
[1:32:32] it do it then these watch this these
[1:32:37] thistles and sickness and death and
[1:32:40] politics and sinful man and sinful woman
[1:32:44] and evil spirits will all be gone away
[1:32:48] and
[1:32:50] annihilated GL hallu
[1:32:54] yes there there there's a world that
[1:32:57] was and we read stories about it and we
[1:33:01] we find out that it got to a point after
[1:33:04] the
[1:33:04] fall mankind broke it God built it
[1:33:07] perfect mankind broke it and then he
[1:33:11] went on from there just doing the best
[1:33:13] he could feel to do in his own head and
[1:33:15] however he you know scoffield talks
[1:33:17] about you know the the the dispensation
[1:33:20] of conscience where every man did that
[1:33:21] which was right in his own eyes brother
[1:33:23] ROM you know um seem to to confirm those
[1:33:27] those U those those break that
[1:33:30] breakdown and so so we find that he got
[1:33:34] to the point where the Bible says this
[1:33:37] really all we know we know that mankind
[1:33:41] around the world got to the point where
[1:33:44] globally his mind of all Humanity was
[1:33:48] evil
[1:33:52] continually see so that means that his
[1:33:55] mind stayed evil even when he went to
[1:34:00] church but there was one Church being
[1:34:02] built that didn't look much like a
[1:34:04] church it looked like a stone mountain
[1:34:07] made perfectly and they called it a
[1:34:09] pyramid and there was a builder who was
[1:34:11] the pastor who had a great revelation of
[1:34:14] God and he actually built the revelation
[1:34:17] of the Redeemer in his church and he got
[1:34:21] so under in such understanding of the
[1:34:24] word of God he got by by by doing by
[1:34:27] letting the Revelation work through him
[1:34:30] he went in a
[1:34:32] Rapture that's what did it he let the he
[1:34:35] let the revelation of the word raise him
[1:34:38] higher and higher and higher until one
[1:34:41] day he was closer to there than he was
[1:34:44] to here and God said you're so close you
[1:34:46] might as well come on in oh I'd like to
[1:34:49] go up to his door and say Lord he say
[1:34:51] come on in Hallelujah
[1:34:57] praise but we find that the whole rest
[1:35:00] of the world except for Noah and his
[1:35:03] family they built an arc to the saving
[1:35:06] of their family and they alone and then
[1:35:08] we had the world that is now and we've
[1:35:11] got that world that's that's here to
[1:35:13] this very hour and it's it's full of
[1:35:17] thistles and sickness and death and
[1:35:20] politics and sinful man and sinful women
[1:35:24] I mean it's listen friends you can go
[1:35:26] out here and you you can go to to the
[1:35:30] big rallies on on both sides of the of
[1:35:33] the of the evil
[1:35:36] Pond both sides of the sickening
[1:35:39] Quagmire and you can see their big
[1:35:42] buildings and their big rallies and
[1:35:45] their High platforms and their
[1:35:47] politicians and you're seeing politics
[1:35:49] and sinful men and sinful women and
[1:35:52] sickness and death and evil spirits I'm
[1:35:55] here to tell you you can see schools you
[1:35:57] can see buildings you can see hospitals
[1:36:00] you can see shopping plazas but it's all
[1:36:03] going to be
[1:36:06] annihilated that will that evil will
[1:36:08] never be on that new
[1:36:13] world he says it's all gone away and
[1:36:16] annihilated it has to be done that way
[1:36:20] because we're going to live right
[1:36:27] hereen so the beauty of it comes down to
[1:36:31] this and here's where I'll hit my pause
[1:36:33] button
[1:36:38] today I
[1:36:41] relish the understanding of the
[1:36:44] word that I can never
[1:36:51] die I have
[1:36:54] eternal
[1:36:55] life you are looking at a man who can
[1:36:58] never
[1:37:00] die this body just a temporary house it
[1:37:03] might lay down and go back to the soil
[1:37:05] and even that won't matter because when
[1:37:07] the trumpet sounds even those elements
[1:37:09] will come
[1:37:10] back beginning with with brother Eddie
[1:37:13] when we put his casket beneath the sod I
[1:37:16] said now folks I told sister mom I said
[1:37:19] I said listen here's all we're doing
[1:37:21] y'all we're just storing his Temple were
[1:37:23] storing his body this is not him he's
[1:37:27] already shouting and running he's had
[1:37:29] many days he ain't even finished shaking
[1:37:31] hands and hugging necks yet eventually
[1:37:33] he'll come back and pick this body back
[1:37:35] up and it'll be changed and he'll be
[1:37:37] glorified right now he's in a theophany
[1:37:40] but then he'll pick these elements up
[1:37:41] because you were always a part of the
[1:37:43] earth he's a he's Redeeming the Earth
[1:37:45] the same way he's redeeming
[1:37:47] you and therefore the Earth can't be
[1:37:50] annihilated I can't be annihilated when
[1:37:54] it's all said and done I'll still be
[1:37:56] alive and well and I'll be living right
[1:37:59] here what is he doing brother Jason what
[1:38:01] is he doing he's changing my
[1:38:05] atmospheres listen we' all have to admit
[1:38:08] today that sin has introduced quite a
[1:38:12] few atmospheres into our life sin has
[1:38:17] brought and and has created atmospheres
[1:38:20] that dwell within us and we call them
[1:38:22] complexes we call them weaknesses and
[1:38:25] they emanate out from us and they harm
[1:38:27] all of those around us and the cycle of
[1:38:29] pain and the cycle of complex it just
[1:38:32] keeps going on and on and on but I'm
[1:38:35] here to tell you my new book is
[1:38:37] annihilating the
[1:38:40] atmospher Hallelujah I'm not going to
[1:38:42] have to live there forever like this I'm
[1:38:45] getting a new body and a new mind and
[1:38:48] he's transforming my mind to believe his
[1:38:51] word
[1:38:56] amen sin you would admit with
[1:38:59] me it's introduced quite a few bad
[1:39:02] atmospheres within
[1:39:06] us a casual
[1:39:09] faith in the message of the
[1:39:12] hour is the most harmful
[1:39:15] atmosphere you can pass
[1:39:18] along to your loved ones it's the most
[1:39:22] harmful atmosphere you can be in
[1:39:24] possession of and it's the it'll do the
[1:39:26] most damage to those you care about the
[1:39:30] most
[1:39:34] amen there's never been a
[1:39:36] person from The Upper Room till
[1:39:39] now that has
[1:39:42] survived that lack of faith without
[1:39:46] incurring much needless need not have
[1:39:50] been pain and loss

[1:39:56] now no one whoever had that lacking of a
[1:40:01] fervent Faith call it a casual Faith but

[1:40:38] word it became a new book to me and I
[1:40:41] became a new book to him Hallelujah my
[1:40:44] name was taken from the book of life and
[1:40:46] put in the Lamb's Book of Life and from
[1:40:49] there it can never pass away Hallelujah
[1:40:52] Heaven's Earth will pass away but his
[1:40:55] word cannot pass away he changed my

[1:41:17] of sin put on me can you be glad for
[1:41:20] that today say oh brother Jason I see

[1:41:26] than I ever have I'm glad because so do
[1:41:28] I oh Hallelujah friends he's
[1:41:30] annihilating everything the curse of sin
[1:41:33] put on
[1:41:34] me as what we were saying last
[1:41:39] Sunday oh I'd love to keep preaching but
[1:41:42] I got to stop I can see what's ahead of
[1:41:44] me let me say
[1:41:50] this while Fallen Humanity
[1:41:55] is
[1:41:56] busy
[1:41:58] annihilating
[1:41:59] themselves by the misuse of creation
[1:42:03] power that's what Atomic power is it's
[1:42:07] Genesis power and sinful man got a hold
[1:42:11] of it we were we you you heard Annie
[1:42:14] Jacobson Jacobson talking last Sunday
[1:42:16] about how that she said in the 20th
[1:42:20] century mankind invented the nuclear
[1:42:22] bomb
[1:42:23] to stop evil and now in the 21st century
[1:42:28] it's that same thing that's going to
[1:42:31] bring an Extinction of it going to
[1:42:34] annihilate Humanity from
[1:42:38] existence and I'm not just talking about
[1:42:42] when the bride is gone and the world
[1:42:45] enters the time called Jacob's
[1:42:47] trouble what we commonly call the
[1:42:49] tribulation period Bible says there's
[1:42:52] never been a time left like it before
[1:42:54] there'll NE thank God there will never
[1:42:56] be another time like it
[1:42:58] afterwards we find that it's not I'm not
[1:43:01] just talking about
[1:43:03] Humanity annihilating themselves in that
[1:43:06] time that's that will be in in in some
[1:43:09] degrees inconsequential to me because
[1:43:13] I'll be at a table thousands of miles
[1:43:15] long I'll be Reaching Across to Abraham
[1:43:18] Isaac and Jacob oh I'll be saying
[1:43:20] Brothers oh what an encouragement David
[1:43:23] yeah you were King I used to read about
[1:43:24] your life it so encouraged me because I
[1:43:27] could see God loved you and even when
[1:43:28] you fell yeah we read about that I'm
[1:43:30] sorry it got put in a book but it
[1:43:33] encouraged me to if he loved you that
[1:43:35] way he could love me that way
[1:43:38] hallelujah oh my but when they're
[1:43:42] because the point I want to make is that
[1:43:44] they're doing it
[1:43:46] now they're annihilating themselves now
[1:43:49] the world is being prepared and
[1:43:51] conditioned under the ministry of a
[1:43:53] false prophet in the Book of Revelation
[1:43:55] an antichrist false prophet who's
[1:43:58] literally preaching them right into a
[1:44:00] tribulation while a real Prophet is
[1:44:02] preaching me right into a body change
[1:44:05] Hallelujah the perfect contrast to God's
[1:44:07] God and Satan's plan perfect contrast
[1:44:10] between them and while they are busy
[1:44:12] annihilating their self their very
[1:44:14] existence God is busy using his creative
[1:44:18] power for something else he's
[1:44:20] annihilating all right he's using his
[1:44:22] power
[1:44:23] to remove all the Fallen parts from me
[1:44:27] he's leaving the only thing he's leaving
[1:44:30] of you is the vision he had of you
[1:44:33] before the foundation of the world oh
