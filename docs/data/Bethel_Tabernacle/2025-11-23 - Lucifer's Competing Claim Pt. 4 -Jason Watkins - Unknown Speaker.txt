I had a request to sing it. Brother Andrew is going to help me out. By the way, the land is laying. I think I'd be safe in saying that over the next hill we'll be home. It's a straight and narrow highway with no detours and no byways. [music] And over [singing] the next hill we'll be home. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; by our prophet. I've been hearing. I would say the end is nearing. For I see familiar landmarks all along. By the dream that I've been dreaming, there will come a great redeeming. And over [singing] the [music] next heel will be home. Oh, by the turn the tide is taken. I would say that there's no mistaking that [music] over the next hill will be home. There's a place [music] that we are nearing that so many have been fearing. And [music and singing] over the next hill will be home. Now, when we get there, we're believing that [music] we'll find that [singing] gate is open and there'll be a refuge from the [singing] coming storm. For this way's [music] been long and weary, but at last the end is nearing. And [music and singing] over the next hill will behold. Oh, and over [music] the next hill will behold. Amen. Let's all stand to our feet. Jesus, draw me close. KF, brother Andy, you ready for the word? Amen. How many come with an expectation that the Lord's going to speak to you? Why don't you raise a hand? Show me that. Show the Lord that. Say, Lord, I came today not just to see or to be seen, but I came to hear from heaven. Amen. Let's sing this as we invite our pastor to come. Jesus, draw [singing] me close, closer, closer, Lord, [singing and music] to you. And let [singing] the world [music] around me [snorts] fade away. [music] [singing] [music] Oh Jesus, draw [singing] me close closer [music and singing] ever Lord to you. For I desire [music] [singing] to worship and oy. [singing] Let's sing it now. Oh [music] Jesus, draw me close, [music] closeer, [singing] Lord, to you. And let [music] this world [singing] around me, let it fade [music] away. [music] Oh Jesus, draw [music] me closer. Is that your prayer? Oh, closer [music] every day [singing] for I desire to worship her. [music and singing] Oh, why don't you raise your hands to the Lord now? Sing it like a prayer just before the word. Oh [music and singing] my Jesus, draw me close, closer, [music and singing] Lord, to you. And [music] let this world [singing] around me fade [music] away. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus, [singing] draw me close closer every day. [music] Oh, closer every day.

[singing] [music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Lord, come Lord to you. &gt;&gt; Oh, let [music] this world around me fade [music] away. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord Jesus, draw me close [music and singing] closer every day.

God bless you today. Happy to have you in the house of the Lord. Amen. I heard some glad tidings being announced out here and some wonderful singing. And you're [clears throat] right. I'm about to become officially great. [laughter] And Sister Jean is about to be double great. [snorts] Amen. [clears throat] Praise the Lord. So, uh, we're happy for that. I my you know when my dad first became great grandpa and I told him I said dad you're a great grandpa. He said well I always knew I was great. Now I've got the evidence. Amen. And so we're [clears throat] happy for those announcements and um [cough] Amen. And happy to have uh brother David Sister and Andrea here with us. Amen. Amen. Happy to have them here. and we had a wonderful joyous time last night [clears throat] and got to see the the video replay of it all. It all turned out really nice and special. Amen. I told [clears throat] um you know the the family and I just kind tried to break it to them easy and um and and I said you know you're you're getting the the most rebellious granddaughter I have. And I said, she was the first one that I made promise me at five years old she would stop growing. And she promised me and she broke that. And when she got seven years old, I made her promise it again. And u she broke that one, too. And then at nine, she broke it. At 10, she broke it. And I finally gave up. I figured [laughter] her and Zoe and me were just going to keep growing. And all these boys. Amen. So, I'm glad to know that I get to start over. Amen. Praise the Lord. [clears throat] All right. I don't want to uh get too far down that today. I'll get talking about wonderful memories and Amen. Praise the Lord. We'll never get to our sermon. You love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're going to invite you to Isaiah chapter 14. [clears throat] And we're going to carry on today. We're I'm circling back to my little miniseries on Lucifer's competing claim. [clears throat] And uh today would be the fourth installment I believe should be part four if I'm not mistaken. And I h have had these parts here. Um and I just I've had them all along. Just about everything I'm going to say today, I've had them all along. But somehow they're uh they just kept getting pushed back and pushed back. And so I just been waiting for the Lord. And we had a few sermons in between. Just been waiting for the Lord to allow me to go back, circle back, and kind of maybe today close out some of uh some of this thought here today. I've enjoyed it. Amen. I trust it's been a blessing to you as well. Amen. Isaiah 14 [clears throat] verse 12. We just catch 12, 13, and 14. How art thou fallen from heaven, oh Lucifer, son of the morning? How art thou cut down to the ground, which dst weaken the nations? [clears throat] For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven. I will exalt my throne above the stars of God. I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation and the sides of the north. This is quite a list. I will ascend above the heights of the clouds. I will be like the most high. That's quite a lot. Let's pray. [clears throat] Father, we thank you for your word today and I now just focusing my mind. Lord, we have many friends here with us today and visitors and special events and how I would just love to talk a little while on that and the the great blessing that it all is to Sister [clears throat] Debbie and I to see how it's all unfolded. But if I do that, Lord, we'll go into the time that I owe to you and to your word. [clears throat] So there'll be plenty of time for that, Lord, in days to come. We're happy to have all of them gathered here with us today, Lord. And we're just trusting you now to take us into your word. And may we have a single focus for just a little while. The [clears throat] world will still be here, Lord. We'll still have the things that we've got to do tomorrow and next week. But how about Lord that we just take a little time, step off of the rat race of life and just listen to the word of God, Father, that it might instruct us and that it might help us, that it might strengthen us. We need the energy that the word gives us, Lord. Now, master, it's been quite a task for me to separate out everything that perhaps I wanted to include and narrowing it down to what I felt is what you want to say. So, we're just surrendering ourselves fresh to you this morning. And if there's yet parts that we don't get to today, well, we'll get to them in your good time. We commit it to you in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you, friends. You can be seated. Amen. Praise the Lord. Happy to continue to have brother James and sister Faith with us as well. They're going to be here for a little while. So, journeying with us. Amen. And we'll do all that we can to keep them. Amen. [laughter] Praise the Lord. [snorts] When last we were covering this subject of Lucifer's competing claim, we spent a great deal of time contrasting it with the claim that God makes in the book of Revelation that there would come a new heavens and a new earth and that God himself would dwell with his people. We've noted in numerous [clears throat] at numerous points along the way, excuse my voice. I'll get I'll get blowed through it here in a minute, that [clears throat] that it was the first and only time that you see in the scripture where God would make that statement that God himself shall dwell. And brother Brandham makes a lot of reference to that about how that the earth, you know, is now a fit place because now everything has ran to its consummation. The the millennium is actually over in the new heavens and the new earth. The earth which lingered in its seventh day for a thousand-year millennial reign. And yet it was not in its eternal day [clears throat] until there would come a a a holy fire and you know that would rain out uh from heaven and we know that at the end of the millennium Satan would come and compass the camp of the redeemed. The Lord would raise them up upon the breath of the earth and rain down holy fire. And then there would come a judgment bar. And we can read about that in the book of Revelation. We can read how the the heavens departed like a scroll. The sea gives up its dead. The dead, both small and great, stand before the judge on the throne. The bride has taken her place with him on the throne. I think I mentioned [clears throat] last time it was either here in the pull pit or in my morning Bible study, online Bible study, I don't remember where, but I was talking about how that the bride uh need not worry that she won't be ready for that. She will have for a she will have been for a thousand years getting getting her seal legs under her and learning how to rule and reign and judge matters as nations are raised up in the millennial world. There's a lot of that that we don't know. There's still a lot of it that's am uh I don't want to say ambiguous. That's probably the wrong word, but there's some of it left um just untold. And brother Brandham said it's a it's a honeymoon. And so he doesn't tell us everything about it. doesn't give us every detail, but we know it's going to be great. &gt;&gt; We know troubles are going to be over. We know we won't weep anymore. We know uh I know that I'll have a glorified body. I'll have a body liken unto his glorified body. And uh you know, just as a as a student of the scripture and studying these things, you know, I don't I don't fully know if everyone in the nations will have that glorified body. Um um I don't know the answer to that. And brother Brandham uh doesn't make that clear himself. In fact, it's when he's asked some of those questions, he actually admits that he doesn't know it himself. And that's where he comes to that statement that he doesn't tell us everything. He said, "God doesn't tell his prophets everything." And then the prophets don't tell the people everything. So, so I I just wanna I just know I want to be there. Amen. I want to enjoy that. I And I just say, "Lord, let me uh you know, complete my assignment here, friends. I want to I want to run my race well. And I want to hear him say, "Well done, my good and faithful servant." And I'm glad that the only parts he'll see are the parts that I ran good. Amen. I'm glad that I won't have to worry about him saying, "Well done, except for no, because those things are all met in Christ. And when I arrive there to take my place on the throne, I won't I won't have to be, you know, the Bible tells us that that you don't want to be the one whose sins follow you to judgment because then you'll have to give an account for them at the judgment bar and there's no mercy. So there the mercy's over. So but you what you want to do is the one that be in the camp where your sins have went ahead of you to judgment and they've already been met in Christ. And when you arrive, it's already set. And here's your take your place on the throne. See, you're in seat 4,964. Row row Q and seat 4. Amen. Thank you. I'll be there. Amen. I don't know. I don't mean to bring it down to natural terms like that. We don't know what it'll be, but I just know it'll be grand. But when it finally when all of that washes out and and Satan is destroyed, Lucifer, his competing claim has been put to silence once and for all because don't forget he's still trying to pull this off at the end of the millennium. &gt;&gt; He still tries. He makes one final one final stab at it. See? [clears throat] And so, so when you when you think about all those things, and I don't want to get into the to the alleyways of all of that cuz we're not trying to teach on the book of Revelation today, but we've been looking long and hard at this competing claim of Lucifer that it is such a polar opposite of the claim that God makes that he would dwell with his people. And I I'm I'm glad the Lord's going to finally end that. I I'm glad he's going to finally put Lucifer, Amen, to the lake of fire. And then there the false prophet, the the anti the whole beast system uh you know even death and hell will be cast in uh and be completely annihilated. And God's the only one that can annihilate anything. He's the only thing that can he put it all together. So he's the only one that can really take it all apart. And brother Brandham said you can burn a piece of paper but you haven't annihilated it. All you've done is is re change it back to its original gases and and elements and cosmic elements that it was. And brother Ram said if time would go on long enough, I mean that could come back to paper again. It could come back as a tree and get harvested and get mil and become paper. Uh you know and and and and here in this life we have no continuing city. But we do seek one uh to come that won't have an end. and that and that you know when once that's once that's happened friends oh once we're gone in that third exodus I can give you this assurance you're never going to have to come back here to a broken world and do this again &gt;&gt; living in a fallen body and a broken world and Satan on the loose and the god of the evil age by popular demand he's the worship being I'm just glad that the Lord Jesus is going to put all of that under his feet forever. &gt;&gt; So, we we've been talking about the contrasting claims between the one that Satan would make and the one that Christ would make. And I want to zero in today on the fact as the prophet has taught us that Satan's attempt to ascend to the throne. Well, you can see it in the text we read, his attempt to ascend to the throne, to go above God through the bride. It goes through. He He's first got to get above the stars. See? Then he's got to take his his seat in the north. That's where God's throne is. Then he's got to be like the most high. And so you you understand that everything that he's doing, it's not about controlling the world. He already has control of the world. They've given him control. &gt;&gt; They've long ago the churches have kicked Christ out and seated control to the Antichrist system. And this is why you see the chaos in the world today and the madness on the streets and the hypocrisy and Christianity today and and and and you know it's just um it's um you you lose words. Uh you know I consider my vocabulary pretty rich being well read uh you know but but I I I come short of words. I don't know how to fully describe what, you know, when I see the the the blatant hypocrisy and nauseating blindness that it's I try not to I try not to let it affect me negatively because, you know, even brother Brandham was was cautioned by the Holy Spirit. you know, be careful who you're calling Rickys and Ricettas because I've got some people in there and and and and remember brother Brandham had the had the dream there where they're behind those bars and and that lady is saying, "Brother Brandham, you've misunderstood these people." And and so, you know, and they're and they're he said they're beating their heads against the bars and there stood Jesus at the top saying, "Deliver these people." And he thought, "How in the world? I'm with my little skinny arms and these big iron bars." But the Lord wasn't looking for him to use his physical might. The Lord was wanting him to have faith in the word of God. And on that alone and nothing else that would be needed is to bring the word of God. And that will set free God's people. &gt;&gt; All who can be set free will be set free by the word of God. I don't have to police you. I don't have to uh follow you home. I don't have to fly a drone around your house. I don't have to, you know, keep tabs on you. I come here and I preach the gospel. And I know that that for believers, the gospel, uh, Brother David and I were discussing this last night. The gospel that we see and we have today, isn't it true, friends? And I don't even have to convince you. I know you'll get what I'm about to say. When you hear that eagle scream and you hear this message and you see how it dovetales the scripture, it just you just there's something in you that goes, "Yeah, there's something in you." Even the parts you don't understand, there's still a part that just goes, "Amen. It's just right. That's just right. Well, how I explain how it's right. I'm not sure I can, but I know it's right." See, it's it's intrinsically right. It's uh and then and what you're what you're actually what's happening there in a in a realm that you can't see and the world can't see, God can see it. And that is that there's a deep calling to a deep and there's a gene of you responding to a gene in him. and that you realize you are a believer of the word because you're part of that word. &gt;&gt; And that's exactly why that you not only you don't obey it out of fear, you obey it out of because I want to obey it. &gt;&gt; Because it's right and I want to be right. I cannot [clears throat] abide that, you know, and I know I'm not alone in that. A real believer, you cannot abide wrong. When you see it, you got to fix it. You have to fix it because the Lord is watching and the word is here and the word is here to bring you to perfection and there's no room for a believer to say I'm just going to get 80%. I'll I'll be comfortable right there. I will never be comfortable there. &gt;&gt; You see, and I and I and in as far as my wins and losses, I'm not sure I'm above 50%. But I know where my desire is. And I know a prophet told Sister Georgie. Bruce, God looks at your heart at what you want to be. I'm so glad for that. &gt;&gt; So, we found out that Satan's desire through the scriptures and the way brother Brandham describes it, and I don't have the time to go down all of the all of those quotes today, but Satan is desiring to ascend through you because he knows he cannot defeat Christ. He he's that's been tried. when Michael and fought with the dragon, Michael and his angels fought the dragon in the book of Revelation. Remember, he takes on titles Lucifer and Satan and that the dragon and and and you know and and and we we we talked about that last time. And so so he's already found out he cannot overthrow Michael with a direct frontal assault. But but somehow he was able to observe and we and I don't have all the answers to that today and brother Brandham doesn't lay it out and we're not dare going to go beyond what a prophet taught us. It's precarious to do that and it's not necessary. We have everything we need for our perfection in the message anyway. So I'm not out here to try to wow you with something. That's not what the gospel is about. The gospel is a person. &gt;&gt; It's not books and tapes and quotes. It's a person of Jesus Christ being revealed to God's people. And that is it. That's the attraction on the mountain. &gt;&gt; See, so so when we when we think about how that God is revealing himself in his word and and Satan knowing that his his best best pathway is to ascend through the bride. If he can defeat her, he defeats him because if she can't be perfected, his word is broken and then he has to seed authority. So this is what he tried in the book of Zechariah the third chapter. He tried to do that. Come into God's courtroom. Brought I um um brings the high priest there and and Joshua the high priest and is accusing the all of Israel. He doesn't need all of Israel standing there. See, Satan doesn't need to just Satan doesn't need um to defeat you. He needs to defeat Christ. See? And so Christ is your high priest. And and so therefore the the the charge was by bringing the high priest is you said and God seated on the throne. The judge is there. He's seated. Daniel saw him seated. And so the the act the accuser is there to accuse Israel. And to say, "Hey, judge, you said your word was these are your chosen people." But yet and you said they're the apple of your eye. You said they're perfect in all their ways. And and and and you said you could never forget them. and they're inscribed on the palms of your hands. But yet, I've got physical evidence that they are hypocrites, they're liars, they're adulterers, they're idolattors, they're liars, they're thieves, they're they're all of these things. And he wasn't wrong in his laundry list of accusations. But the but the judge dismissed all of his actual evidence on a single premise that that Israel was elected. Period. full stop. This is Jerusalem whom I have chosen. And therefore, the case was sumearily dismissed. No accusation would ever be heard again. And Satan was driven from the courtroom. And Paul would say, "There is now therefore no condemnation to them which are in Christ. You are unarrestable. You are un unindictable. You are unchargeable. God will not hear the case. uh his bride is as perfect as he is. &gt;&gt; Because not because her wins and loss record is perfect, but because she has believed the report. &gt;&gt; She has believed. She has received the word for her day. And that is and God said, "If you do that," he told that middle age, that thyroid age, if you do that, I will I will put none other burden upon you just that you believe my word. And so we see those parallels coming in the day and hour that we live in just like that church age faced Jezebel religion and faced the total uh beginning of the dark ages. And that's where we are. That's why that fourth age has such a parallel to the seventh age because again here's Jezebel religion. Here's the the the dark ages. Christ is kicked out. It's it's darkness upon the whole world and gross darkness upon the minds of the people. But God had an event that he had been watching and waiting for centuries through millennia that finally he could say, "Arise, shine, thy light has come." &gt;&gt; So this is where we are today. And so I was we were saying to you in our last installment that just as the gospel as Paul would say the gospel came not in word only but in power and demonstration of the word. So I I just I just I just said it this way in my own wording. I have come into the world as a believer not in election only. That's not why I'm here just to enjoy the fact that I'm elected. [gasps] But I'm here not in election only, but in power and demonstration of the election that I'm a part of. &gt;&gt; And that's your mission. &gt;&gt; That's what Christianity is all about. And to see the blatant hypocrisy today, what they call Christianity. And I, [clears throat] you know, I was watching um um a a clip um not that I not that I'm subscribed to this this channel and I wouldn't be subscribed to it at all. He's quite a popular podcaster, a number of podcasters and but he had a he was doing a particular thing that I had an interest in. I was studying on it [clears throat] and you know he he's he's in in in in [clears throat] one word he's saying you know all glory to God and we thank God and I pray you know I pray for this and I pray for that and you know I'm I'm here to tell you that prayer and he and he's just he's almost like giving a sales pitch for for Christianity you know and then it's not you you can't even get 10 words later and and he's throwing out the most horrible profanity and vulgar profanity and then circle back around to thanking God and blessing the name of God and his host doing the same thing. Yes, you know, if it wasn't for God, I don't know what I'd do and where I'd be. And then the next thing is profanity, profanity, profanity, you know, but thanks be to God. And I just thought, this is worse than sad. This is nauseating. &gt;&gt; I'm just so glad God sent us a clean message. and a clean messenger and a and gave us a clean word of God. And I'm I'm glad Jesus lived a clean life. I'm glad the apostles were overcomers because it tells me I can be an overcomer. &gt;&gt; So Lucifer, of course, has been prosecuting his plan for 6,000 years since Eden. And you know the um I I appreciate that in the book of Revelation that the first act by Christ of calling it a new heavens and a new earth signals to me a finality of everything previous. &gt;&gt; Now that means that means all the sin in the world it's all gone. any tangible evidential mistakes that I made gone, never to return, annihilated. They already are. But but when you come to the end of the millennium, there's still this this aspect of saying now I make all things new. I just want to say to you today, friends, I don't even uh I I don't know. I don't need I don't need your biography of the things you've been through, the ups and downs. I do know this. You've had them. &gt;&gt; I I don't need your successes and failures. I know you've had them. I don't need your joys and your sorrows. I know if you're a human being, you've had them. But I want you to know today that there's coming a day where all things will be made new &gt;&gt; and Jerusalem will again rejoice and the bride will rejoice at the sound of the bridegroom. And I I just I I'm able to endure no matter what Satan throws at me. No matter what this world becomes, I know I can say, "Go ahead, Satan. This is your day, but my day is coming." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God dwelling with his people in the fullness of his manifestation and in all categories. And and so so now I'm sure I wouldn't need to explain further or convince you. Uh I'm sure you understand that this is exactly the what and the why of Satan's attack when he because he's trying to to stop you as a manifestation of this. That's his plan. See, because that's when he can break God's word. Because God's word is is that he would have a bride like this. And so if Satan can hinder your manifestation, you say, "Well, I'm I'm eventually I'm eventually going to get there." And election tells me that that's true. But what about now? What about what am I doing for him right now? I already know I should be able to run free knowing that my destination is predetermined and I'm elected in God. I should be able to go full force and I say, "I don't care what the devil does. I'm going to serve the Lord and my life is going to be a manifestation of his word &gt;&gt; because I want my life to count for something here and now. I already know what it's going to be there and then." &gt;&gt; So, [clears throat] and it's and it's not just a a millennium, you know? I mean, my goodness, even I remember when Pope John Paul, you know, made his proclamations and and they were they were they they were not uncertain about it. They made it publicly known that they believed that the Roman church would be able if everybody would just line up under the Roman Catholic system, they could introduce a millennium to the earth. And I just thought to myself, but I don't want that kind of millennium because I've got enough history, a study of history. I know how it is when you guys are in perfect power and you have supreme power. That's not the kind of earth I want to live in. You say, "Well, but it it might be better than what we got now. It's it's not going to be as good as what I could have in Christ." &gt;&gt; So, it's it's not about I'm not looking for, you know, I'm not looking for second, third, or fourth. I want first. If you're not first, you're last. So, I want to be first. See, so this is where we read how the morning stars came together. And and there's a number of things that we can look at today that we and we can't go further than what the scripture shows us. We can't go further than what a prophet explained it. But we do have some insight. And you know, we do know that morning stars sang together. We do know that. We do know there was a time in the aons where sons of God shouted for joy. And we do know brother Brandham, you know, um, kind of moving around in the language of of a of of asserting that that he and and there's some quotes where he actually is talking about how that, you know, you were somewhere else before you were here. Now, he did not believe in pre-existent souls as the Mormons teach that. We know that. That's something else we know. He didn't believe in the Mormon doctrine of pre-existing souls, but he did say, "See, you were somewhere else." He and he would say things like, and I'm paraphrasing somewhat, he would say, "You don't remember it now. There's a veil over your memory, but someday that veil is going to be lifted and you're going to be home and you're going to realize [laughter] I'm back home." See? So, so you know, brother Brandham would would make statements about how that, you know, when in Genesis when he says, "Let us make man in our image." And brother Brandham has taught us in pretty clear language that when he said, "Let us make man in our image," he made his whole family. In his mind, he had his whole family. So, so what we're doing today is just living out the vision that God had of you before the foundation of the world. This is why what it that that's a glorious thing to you is a teeth grinding frustration to Lucifer because he's never been able to figure out how that he makes it harder on you and you love God more. And the the hotter the trials, the greater your faith. And and when he knocks you down, you raise up stronger than before he knocked you down. &gt;&gt; And and and and I and it it seems in congruous to him that how was it that he collapsed Adam in the way that he did? And yet when Adam, you know, a a a son of God, I'm going to say it like this, a son of God, born in sin, redeemed back to Christ, is of more value to God than when he was back there shouting for joy, looking at the plan of redemption. Because because now as long as all of that family sons and daughters just stayed there shouting over the plan of redemption, then he's never going to be it's it's like, "Okay, guys, we need to get on with it because the whole plan is for me to become a redeemer. The whole plan is I'm going to be a savior. I'm going to be a healer. I'm going to be a protector." And none of that stuff is going to be possible if he doesn't bring an earth, set it up to where he can't he can't entrap e Adam and Eve to fall, but he can build it and create it and create the serpent in such a way and and make Eve a certain such a way that she could fall. And so he didn't force them to do it, but but they made that choice on their own. But, you know, it's not like God was worried because Adam was not just a son of God. The Bible says Adam was the son of God. &gt;&gt; And so, he was the first Adam. Jesus is the second Adam. So, God already knew that Adam would step forward to save her just like he already knew he would in Christ step forward and become sin. He who knew no sin, never committed a sin, became sin. &gt;&gt; This is why I've said for years that when brother Brandon would say, "You have to be able to read Christ in every verse. And if you can't, you can go back and read it again. You've missed it." But the problem is as human beings when we look at that, we read about some pretty heinous stuff, some pretty twisted stuff. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean, God's family don't have a perfect track record. Only only Christ has the perfect track record. That's why there's only one elected son, and that's Christ. Well, how did you get elected? You were in him before the foundation of the world. So, election is origin. And and so, so we find out then that that when I read about those horrible, devious deeds, I just say, how am I going to read Jesus in that? Because Jesus never did all of these things, but you and me did. And he took our sin upon himself and became guilty. And God against all odds, against all what we would call common sense, against everything that's right and wrong. And in the name of everything that's right and wrong, God seemed to violate every possible thing that you that you would say this is wrong. God traded the innocent for the guilty. &gt;&gt; And then people wonder why we sing about the love of God and weep tears. People wonder why the angels can't ever sing that song because angels are on a different order. They they they never were uh they're not his offspring per se like sons and daughters of God are. And so, so we realize then that that when when morning stars are singing together and God has his whole family in his mind and and as the plan of God's family, a plan of God for his family begins to form and it begins to come into focus and and you know it I think that at that point that Lucifer could certainly see that um you know he he could see that that he would be playing second fiddle to this family. Wow. Here I am, the right-hand man of God. I'm the first and highest angel. I'm the archangel. I stand at the right hand of the throne. And and that's why Jewish scholars e acknowledge and most Christian scholars even from the early ages believe that Lucifer was the very brother Ram said the first thing brother Ram said the first thing that God did was create angels. And so the first one he would have created was Lucifer. He was the highest. And then and he's the right hand. And so can you imagine having been that right-hand man, but you're you're an angelic being and suddenly you begin to see a plan. And I don't know how it all happened. We don't know where it how long it took. Brother Brandham said it might be aons and and and millions of years. We don't know. All I know is that there was a time when morning stars sang together and sons of God shouted for joy and it was viewable. A prophet saw it. Can you imagine for a moment how Lucifer began to observe that and say, "Wow, wait a minute. Hold on. Wait a minute. You mean to tell me that I thought it's just me and then God, and there's nothing in between me and God, and now I'm finding out there's a whole another expression of God's multiplied life that's going to be higher than me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I don't know if if that was, you know, I'm not a prophet. I can't I can't do like Isaiah and discern the secrets of Satan's of Lucifer's heart, but I know how I would feel. I'm think my goodness. Uh you mean wow what a discouraging thing you know no wonder he would maybe that would maybe that was the final straw that broke the camel's back. Maybe he that's what initiated his his desire to go into manifestation because remember every brother Brandham said a word is a thought expressed and the Bible teaches us that. And so Satan before he ever committed, you know, um those kinds of of deeds, uh he had it in his heart. That's what the prophet of you said in your heart. &gt;&gt; See, long before you ever showed your card, you were already that was already in your heart, thinking God didn't see it and God saw it the whole time. See, now I don't know. I I'm not a prophet. I can't say that's how Satan felt. But I do know that by the time I get to material that I can absorb, I do know that Satan has devised a plan to shortcircuit that by getting control of the family. See, and so this is then you've got a fall in the garden. And it's it's not so much about a a literal seed, but it's now about a spiritual seed because it doesn't matter that all of these sons and daughters of God who were shouting for joy, they're all going to come through a sex birth and they're going to be in Satan's pawn shop. and he'll have a right to them unless somebody comes and sets them free. Oh, hallelujah. My So, you know, I I I was looking at some research on the very name Lucifer. I found some interesting things that I hadn't been aware of before. Now, this part I was I was aware of. Lucifer, the name means lightbringer or morning star. And so originally it referred metaphorically to a bright star. In fact is the morning star. Remember we was preaching here some time ago and brother Brandham's talking about the morning star and the evening star. They're the same star. And we found out the morning star is the planet Venus. You remember that? And we found out that no man hath seen Venus at any time because it's surrounded by a cloud. All you see is the light of the sun shining off the cloud of witnesses that there's a planet down inside there. See? And so, so you know, just like no man hath seen God at any time, but the only begotten hath declared him. So God is a spirit. See, and that that's why Jesus would say, "The hour is coming and now is that they that worship must worship in spirit and in truth." God had for 4,000 years had his family worshiping him. But Jesus is trying to get it across to the to the woman at the well that the Holy Ghost is coming. God's whole plan is to get inside of his people and so that their life is a worship &gt;&gt; as brother Diggs was preaching Wednesday. Then your life, the time is coming and now is when they that worship must worship in spirit. &gt;&gt; This was God's goal to turn you into him. &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. To have a bride that are his offspring. to have a family that are made out of the same word that Jesus was made from. &gt;&gt; He's the beginning of the creation of God. He's a prototype for a brand new type of human. &gt;&gt; This is why they can't figure out the godhead because they look at it from the aspect of of their own humanity. And when you do it like that, sometimes it can look like multiple persons. But they they're constantly losing sight of the fact that Jesus wasn't just a man. He was a man, but he wasn't merely a man. See, he was 100% a man, but he wasn't merely a man. To use William Brandham's exact language, he was man plus. See, brother Brandon would say he was the God man. So now, that's a prototype. That's a brand new type of human being. And unless you look at the Godhead through that and and get away from your own human reasoning and realize this is this is not a normal human. This is man plus. See this is the God man. Then it begins to then you begin to understand expression. And then when you understand that he is an expression then you understand that as part of the word you're a further expression. And that's why a prophet would say him being the beginning of the creation of God, you are the continuation of that same creation. &gt;&gt; See, so so he's not coming to, you know, he he he when he comes into the soul, this is exactly why the soul, the old nature, brother Brandon would say, it's not your body that died or spirit that died. It's your nature that died, that fallen nature that you were born under. And God is not going to inhabit a temple and share that realm of the soul. One is going to have to die so the other can be born. See, because it would be illegal for him to do that. That's I mean, there's so many Old Testament laws that cover that. you you I mean the law of the Nazarite do you know the if a Nazarite took a vow and they let's say they took a 30-day vow and you know anybody could take a Nazarite a man or woman then for however long they said it was a time of dedication unto the Lord and and it was a vow that you took and if you're on your let's say you took a 30-day you know I'm going to have a Nazarite vow for 30 days and on the 29th day somebody beside you falls dead and falls into you you're contaminated and your whole vow is broken see because and That's why when they when the when the when the people are are are are suggesting the nonsense that they're the prophet comes to the priesthood and he says here's a question for you. If if something clean touches something unclean, does the unclean become clean or does the clean become unclean? And they immediately knew the law. They said the clean becomes unclean. So the clean touching the unclean doesn't make it clean. It makes the clean unclean. So, so it'd be legal for God to come and live inside your soul with a fallen nature. So, that old nature has got to die and a gene of God has got to come forward and it's got to be the literal brother Brandon would say Zoey life. That's not a different life or an additional life. That's the same life multiplied. &gt;&gt; And that's the new birth. And then now you've got now begins the greatest battle ever fought because the soul is in the presence of God. It's dwelling in heavenly places and it's living inside of a body and a spirit that are not converted. So there's where the warfare comes and there's where Satan is attacking. And and when you become born again, that's when the battle starts. You don't have a battle when all three of you of all three of the realms of you that make up you uh are all in darkness. You don't you don't even commit sin. Brother Brandham said it be he said he held up his Bible and he said it'd be like me saying there's black on this. Well, that would be silly. The whole cover's black. When you're when you're in sin before you're born again, uh you're you're just a sinner. You're in sin. Your sins aren't even counted against you. It's a mood point. You're going to die and go to hell unless you get born again. &gt;&gt; See, and then once you're born again, now becomes the greatest battle ever fought. Oh my, I got to keep moving. So, so then you can see why Lucifer was called the morning star. The the in fact is the use of Lucifer as a proper name for the devil actually developed more under Christian early church Christianity than it ever did. only the Jews never saw it like that at all really. They looked at Job and they looked at Zechariah 3 and they they looked at Satan, you know, the one that troubled David and numbered the people. So they looked at him at Lucifer. They knew the devil was real, but they looked at him as just an adversary and he's just an accuser or he's just a he's he's an obstacle. But it was, you know, only with within about probably the the the the first maybe first and part of the second century BC did some of the writers begin to, you know, prior to Christ begin to realize, hey, there might be more to it than this. And by the time you get to the to the gospel writers, by the time you get to Jesus, it's pretty clear there's a devil. &gt;&gt; And it's pretty clear that the church is under his domain. And it's pretty clear that he's there to rescue people from the dominion of Satan. And so this why brother Brandon would say don't let anybody tell you the devil's not real. He's very real. See, but greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world. &gt;&gt; So so he it's developed under mainly under Christian tradition and uh there there was a you know they they didn't even u the the the Hebrew word is h e y l e l h as best I can pronounce it. That's probably butchering the Hebrew uh the way it sounds. But but we find that it just means light. And you remember was it James who talks about how that Satan can appear as an angel of light. See? And so there's all kinds of of of scriptures. I don't want to I I've got a bunch written down here, but but it but not originally was the devil given this name uh Satan or connecting that to Lucifer in Isaiah. To the Jews, they just thought Isaiah is a is a is a warning against the king of Babylon. See, and even if you go over into Ezekiel and you find out that he's the anointed cherub, well, they say, "Well, that's just God. That's a metaphor for God warning the king of Ty." And it and it really took the gospel and the gospel writers to really bring that together. And the apostles began to speak about spiritual wickedness in high places. And we wrestle not against flesh and blood. See, that's kind of new thinking to Jews. We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but we wrestle against powers, principalities, powers of the air. See, and and and and even Satan who can appear as an angel of light. And by the time John comes back with the book of Revelation, he's a dragon. &gt;&gt; And he and remember we found that the verse where he's the dragon, he's Satan, he's the devil, he's all of the above. So these are things that developed in the early Christian church and and and and how that the whole concept that that Lucifer represented the the first or high ranking angel created in the heavenly realms. Um that that was kind of new when the when the New Testament writers looked at at Ezekiel 28 as the anointed cherub or they looked at Isaiah 14 as as Lucifer falling from heaven. And and there's where brother Brandham is going to to take under the trumpets and the vials and he's going to point back to the star that fell from heaven. Remember Jesus said that he said to the disciples, "I saw Satan fall from heaven." See, and so because what was doing that? The gospel was going forward. Do do you comprehend today that you're not here to just have better theology than the Baptists or the Lutheran? that you're actually a continuation of the book of Acts, that you're actually supposed to have a life of spirit and truth that honors God and worships the true God and and exhibits and exerts the power and the authority of the word of God. &gt;&gt; See, so just as Jesus backed down devils, you're to be backing them down. Jesus said that, "Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature." See, he tells them in the book of Mark, you know, they'll lay hands on the sick, if they drink any deadly thing, all of these different things. And you see when the book of Acts opens, they start doing that. So, I I you know, I just I get flabbergasted at times at people who who want to decry this message or the messenger and say the message is a cult and the messenger was false. And I'm like, well, how does it create people in this image? I mean, what's what's doing that? And and why is it if you have if what you have is so true, why are you full of such hypocrisy? And you're nothing even like your founding fathers. I can't even I can't even say the Lutheran are holy like Luther. I can't even say the Methodists, you don't even go back a couple hundred years to your founder. &gt;&gt; And we're the ones that are a cult. Are you kidding? See, and and so but then you you begin to realize that that's the level of spiritual blindness. &gt;&gt; See, it's a spiritual blindness. And they brother Brandham's called it the saddest part of it because they don't you can't tell them anything. They they think they see. See, but they've long ago closed their eyes. And it's not God. You can't impugn him with that. We've proven that by the Bible many times. Jesus said their eyes they have closed. See, lest at any time they see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand and then they and be converted and I should heal them. So we we know that when they knew God as God, they worshiped him not as God. We know that God hardened Pharaoh's heart. But the what most people don't want to tell you is that five times before God hardened his heart, Pharaoh hardened his own heart. See, so so you know, we we talk about, you know, uh Satan masquerading as an angel of light. See, I think I think I might have said James, it's actually Paul in 2 Corinthians. And Revelation 12, you know, depicts a a heavenly war with Michael and his angels fighting against the dragon identified as Satan, and he's cast out with his angels. I'm trying to move quickly. We can we find that we we know by clear implication in the scripture that he had been thinking about it prior to doing it because that's what brother Brandham showed us. A word is a thought expressed. And that's why the Bible would say listen I'm going to I'm going to tell you how to get better victory in your physical overcoming life. And that is bring every thought subject to the Holy Ghost. See, if you would do, as soon as Satan, he's got a right to bring the thought. But if you would just immediately bring that subject to the Holy Spirit, the whole I remember my daddy taught me that from a small boy. This is how you fight devils, Jason. This is how you do it. How do I do it, Dad? How do I get victory? I want to I want to have victory like you got victory. He said, "Here's what you do, son. Every time the devil comes at you with a wrong thought, you bring it to the Holy Ghost, and he'll kill it on the spot." Man, I thought the Holy Ghost must be the biggest, baddest dude I'd ever heard of. Wow. You mean I can just bring that thought and he'll just crush it? He said, "He will crush it. He will stomp it. He'll wipe it out and you'll you'll stay free." I said, "Man, whoa. That's what I'm going to do." And and that's where I found victory. And that's where I've also found failure when I don't do that. &gt;&gt; See, so we know that it starts in the heart. Um Jesus taught us in the 15th chapter of Matthew that what defiles a person is from the heart. that evil thoughts that murder, adultery, theft, all these different things, long before they're ever an outward action, they're an inner thought that got toyed and played with. See, um, here's that scripture I was trying to refer to in James 1 that was in my mind explaining how James 1:14 and 15. I'm not going to take the time to read it, but it explains how that each person is tempted when they are drawn away and enticed by their own lust. See, you're still in a fallen body. So, these are I I've got another series that I'm going to start soon. I've been building material for it and waiting for the Lord's uncction. But it but it's spiritual warfare 101 because God hasn't left us without a defense &gt;&gt; and how to use it. And he's given us the key of understanding. See, and so demonology is real. And we want to take some lessons on that. Paul talks about putting off the old self in Ephesians 4 which is corrupted by deceitful desires and putting on the new self which is created in righteousness. So we know how this works. So this is why brother Brandham would would would say how that a word is a thought expressed and in fact is if you if you go to brother Brandham's teaching when he comes over to the book of revelation there in chapter 12 when Michael and Lucifer fought and Michael and his angels Lucifer the dragon and his angels and he took a a his tail caught a third of the stars of heaven and and and only you'd have to be a prophet to have the authority to do this. I certainly couldn't do it, but when I read it, it he he took his t a i l, his tail. Now, don't don't have a have a fainting spell because remember everything John's seeing is metaphorical symbolism. There's not a real red dragon flying around. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, he takes and brother Brandham is going to unlock the mystery of his t a i l and says what it was was his t a l e. that the red dragon's tail that deceived a third of the stars was the tale he told. He was telling it to Eve. He's telling it to the churches today. It's the same lie. It's the exact same lie that Eve fell for. See, &gt;&gt; and and and and remember that the lie that Eve was told, look at it from a from a higher altitude than just getting right down and saying, "Well, you know, he told her she could eat fruit." But that's all part and parcel of the greater thing that he first got her mind to. And his original lie was you don't have to believe every word of God. God's word has variation and you can pick and choose. &gt;&gt; You can kind of just, you know, uh have your own opinion. And I'll look, okay, tell me what a prophet said and I'll go home and think about it. You're going to destroy yourself, your family, your children, everything that you love. Satan is going to take from you because you have not got enough audacity to stand on the pure word of God and say, "God sent me a word and sent me a prophet and told me how to believe it and how to engage the powers of God." &gt;&gt; See, everybody wants their own opinion. So, I think once Satan realized that he was only ever going to be temporarily God's right-hand man, eventually through the plan of redemption that God's family would be in that position above him. And so, you know, I think that maybe at least that's where he conjured up his plan. And so, how he would ascend to the throne through the family, I don't want to repeat myself. That was I'm I'm just trying to get you to understand that that was the ultimate inside play. Because Satan saw a way to do it. You say, "Well, how do you know he thought that?" Because I can see what he did. And I know that an action is a thought expressed. See? So, so, so in any case, a a place higher than where Lucifer stood was beginning to come in view. A place where without controversy, there's no doubt about this statement. For sure Lucifer would as an angelic being would never be in that place. He would never be a son. He's an angel. He would never be no matter how the original one, the highest ranking, it didn't matter. God's right-hand man, it didn't matter. Once the plan of redemption began to be made clear and the scene began to take shape, Lucifer knew that there under no circumstances could he ever be a son. The same way that the family of God knows that under no circumstances can you ever not be a son and daughter of God. &gt;&gt; Just as sure as he couldn't be, you must be. You shall be. God will cause it to be. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So our position then would be occupying this space that would open up in redemption wherein wherein although and I'll use brother Brandham's language I am not he. See he said I am not the son of man. I'm a son of man revealing the son of man. See, so although once this plan of redemption began to take place, it became apparent that the family was being formed for the express purpose to bring glory to God by being able just as Jesus did, just as Paul did, just as a prophet did to take every spirit under your control for the glory of God. No matter because listen, this is this is what's happening under redemption. And this is what Satan could never come to that no matter what would happen that although I am not he and neither am I the son of man but as a child of God when I put the word of God on my lips and the anointing of the Holy Spirit is upon me then I operate creation powers it's the same as God speaking and that's what Lucifer didn't have he didn't have the power of creation say oh I don't I don't see me creating anything a prophet already showed you under the third pull. It will create something out of nothing. &gt;&gt; And I'm here to tell you something, friends. What you are to do is realize the position that you have being redeemed in Christ. And when you go to your home, I don't care what the devil invades your life, invades your home, invade your family, you are to walk in in faith and say under the authority as a child of God, I commit the Holy Spirit that he will take control of every foul spirit. Cast it out of your home. Cast it out of your life. cast it out of your family. You have the authority. And that's what Satan doesn't want you to know. &gt;&gt; He was furious when Isaiah outed him in Isaiah 14. He didn't want anyone to know the desire that he had had in his heart because that exposes him. See, so it operates creation power and [snorts] with the tremendous stamina that it takes to you know in this impossible hour to remain constantly spiritually minded. Am I am is that true? It's a constant, this is such a dark, such an impossible time to constantly, you have to constantly, you can't afford to not read your Bible every day. You can't afford to not pray every day. You can't afford to miss church. You can't afford to not fellowship. You can't afford to live on an island. You can't you cannot afford to not come into contact with the moving real power of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; I'm here to tell you something, friend. get to where you can enter in and out and go in and out of the presence of God and let the let the word saturate your being and the world will look different to you when you do that. I'm here to tell you something friends that uh you know if you some sometimes I wonder if we have the courage today. I wonder if you do and if you don't I'm hoping that I can inspire you today and I would say to you do you have the courage uh you know to stand and say today I am a member of the divine family. &gt;&gt; I'm in that number robed in white. &gt;&gt; Are you in that number? It's a bloodwashed number. Hallelujah. Oh, we've had an example uh of the sheath waving in our day. &gt;&gt; We've had an example of the sheath waving in our day. Listen friends, that that let me say it to you. That wasn't just a mere consequence of his prophetic office. That was his dedication and his con consecration to God on a daily basis. And and and so when I when I look at it like that, I wonder if you have enough faith in your heart today to take authority over the powers of darkness that have invaded your life today. You don't have to leave here bound. You can leave here free. You don't have to worry about your home and your family. You have been given the authority. That's what the third pull is all about. Amen. &gt;&gt; For a bride to come to her position, &gt;&gt; see &gt;&gt; where we can walk into any situation, any situation that the Lord sees fit to thrust us into. Amen. And call on the Holy Ghost to take control over every spirit. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; I don't know. And I'm I I'm watching my time. I'm going to finish up here in a minute. I don't know if I'll cover all this today. It's all right. If I don't, we'll have a part five. I just want to, you know, take this to and turn a corner with it. I don't want to a new, it's not a new thought. I'm just taking what we've just said. And I want you to think about this angle. I don't know today. I know for me, I don't know for you. I know for my wife probably because I live with her. I know pretty much for my sons, although they've lived independently for me for years. So, I know less now about this area of their life uh than I did when they were under my roof. I don't know where or how severely Satan may have caused you here today. And there might only be one person or the person might be on across the internet. I don't know. All I know is God burdened my heart to say it like that. that I don't know where or how severely Satan has caused you to doubt your identity in Christ. You haven't doubted Christ. You haven't doubted the word for your hour. You're a believer for real. See, but brother Brandham talks about a certain thing called spiritual uh amnesia. And a lot of times, and he said the thing that'll cause spiritual amnesia is halting between two opinions for too long. You're not just a, you know, it's like brother Matthew's sermon about, you know, uh, the the traffic circle. That traffic circle is not made for you just to drive around and around. It's meant to go in it and drive out of it. You're going somewhere. See? And so, a lot of times people lose the a sense of their spiritual identity. I don't know. Maybe it's been a a long trial that has left you feeling blasted and worn and, you know, more more dim days and long nights than you can count. And I just challenge you today on the authority of the word to to just once and for all throw all your reasoning out that your reasoning that sees all your own failures and all your own shortcomings and lift up your head. Your redemption draws nigh. &gt;&gt; And that's what we are coming to friends. That is what God is here to set you free from every condemnation and every weakness that keeps you bound. I just would say today, take courage and say, I am a member of the bloodwashed family. I am a member. I shouted around the throne and my my future is bright and my future is certain and I'm here to see the devil defeated. I'm not here to linger in Leodysa. [screaming] I'm recognizing who I am &gt;&gt; and that I can do the greater works because of knowing who I am. See, whatever prisoners chain Satan has slipped on you, they can't hold you. You're predestinated not to fall and get left behind in Satan's Eden. I'm going to close with this quote today. I can feel the Holy Spirit giving me a green light to close. soul knowing that I have knowing that I have this authority over Satan. When my life, and this is a big if, if my life is guided and controlled by the Holy Ghost, then then the uh the the play here is not to see how I can exert superhuman willpower to be an overcomer. That's that's not the play. That's what Satan wants you to get trapped in because that's just a traffic circle. You know why? Because you'll never completely defeat that. And every time he trips you or stumbles you, even in the slightest, you'll realize you're still in a traffic circle. And that's just no place for a believer. Oh, I want to ascend the heights. I want to be like an eagle. I want to soar. Friends, do you understand that this is what the plan of redemption is to accomplish? And and it's not about trying to use maximum human willpower. Instead, here's what you can control. Remove anything or any person from your life that keeps you from moving closer to the Lord. &gt;&gt; See, you thought I was going to give you some super hard to understand prescription. I haven't. It's like Peter. What do we do? Repent. What does repent mean? Turn and go the other way. See that? It's not about using maximum human power. I'm reading my own line to you. Instead, remove anything or any person. And you know what they are. You might hide it from me. You can't hide it from him. It might be a person. You know who it is. say, see, you got to remove anything or any person from your life that keeps you away from moving closer to the Lord. If you will do that, he will take over your will. &gt;&gt; And it won't be you exerting your will, you you know what you'll have? You'll have the same inside power that he exercised in the wilderness. Brother Brandham said he could have used his great power. Satan said, "You're hungry." That was true. Turn these rocks into bread. He could have done it. But brother Brandham says, "I'm so glad we had a prophet." Boy, we just there's so much we wouldn't know. I couldn't have preached 80% of this sermon today if I didn't have a prophet giving me the insider trading info [sighs] so that I can make the right investment. [laughter] Hallelujah. Say that's cheating. It's It's not cheating that I'm born a son of God. That's not cheating. That's not fair or unfair. It just is. See, I was born in the family of God. So, Brother Brandham said Jesus could have used his power for those things, but he didn't want to use his great power. He wanted to prove to his family coming behind him, the ones that would worship him in spirit and in truth once the Holy Ghost was given that that family could overcome no matter what the devil threw at him. Whatever he threw at Jesus in the wilderness, Jesus overcame it by simply two things. Standing on the word of God and knowing who he was. &gt;&gt; Brother Bon talks about that in Is worthy of the gospel. It's a question we need to ask ourselves every day we wake up. Is my life worthy of the gospel? And if it's not, fix it. &gt;&gt; See, and brother Brandham says, "Jesus never screamed at devils. He didn't have to." &gt;&gt; See, I know I scream all the time. I I get loud. That's just me. This is who I am. But Jesus never screamed at devils. Brother Brandham didn't. Very few times do I You ever hear Brother Brandham raise his voice. A few times. You can hear it on tape where he literally yells out. almost takes you back when you hear like whoa wow he really meant that and you know Satan come out of him you know and wow wow what did did I hear that wrong running back you know usually he's just a very calm come out of him Satan you know oh here's one crying and you see that black streak now you're both delivered see and so you know here's a person and you've got this problem and that problem this problem are these things true yes you don't have them anymore go and praise the Lord amen hallelujah that's what I want my life to do is to praise and worship the Lord. But brother Brandham said he never screamed and yelled I I can't remember which word it uses exactly at devils bec because he knew who he was. So now now we come to this quote and with this I close prophet starts with now remember this. So, I can say to you today, if you forget, I know you won't because what I'm about to read is going to is going to augment everything I've said. But here's what a prophet wanted you to remember above all things. He's not saying, "Remember how many zeros are in your bank account, you know, remember how handsome you are. Remember how many friends you've got, remember how many likes you have, remember how many followers you've got." No, remember this. Christ, I'm gonna read it slow. Absorb the words. Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts. Remember that when you go from here today, remember that Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts. Thank you, brother Brandham. How does that how's that going to work? What would that look like? Glad you asked. The book of Revelation shows how that the Antichrist spirit would come into the church and how and defile it. Make it lukewarm man. Yeah. Formal powerless. Oh boy. It exposes what does revelation. It exposes Satan revealing his works. Now, what are his works? The attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's word. Do you see how that connects? The whole way that he's going to discredit God's word is the destruction of God's people. He already knows he can't beat Jesus. &gt;&gt; He already knows Michael already whipped him. That's that's been tried. It failed. He got tossed. See, so he he knows. Here's what he knows. It exposes Satan, revealing his works, his attempted destruction of God's people, and the discrediting of God's word right down to the time he is cast into the lake of fire. That's why I said he's going to fight. He's going to make one last coup attempt at the end of the millennium. See, if you expect him to just leave you alone, you're going to have to become undesirable for him to be around. You're going to have to smell like righteousness. He don't like that smell. &gt;&gt; You're going have to smell like holiness. He You want a repellent? Live a holy life. &gt;&gt; Stay in prayer. Read your Bible. Let the living image of the living word live through you. And that's when you'll walk down the street and demons seeing you coming will howl and faint run the other direction. That's when you'll take every spirit under the control of the Holy Ghost for the glory of God. Not your glory, but for the glory of God. &gt;&gt; His attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's word. Matt, bring your team and come on. Keep paying attention now. I'm reading this out slow. Right down to the time he is cast into the lake of fire. He fights that he cannot stand it. Fights what? Can't understand what revelation working in your life. Revelation of what? The word. And what is the revelation of the word? Who you are in Christ. Who you are always were going to be. See, write down. Okay. He knows. He fights that. See, so he fights. What he can't stand is you realizing what I'm preaching today and you believing it. And so he fights it. Do you know how he fights it? By stumbling you so that you go, man, everybody must have got it but me. It's not about that. I This isn't hocus pocus. I'm not reading out of a magic book. I'm not speaking magic words over you. I'm giving you the unadulterated word of God. And it has creation power inside of it. See, so he knows it. He He fights it. He cannot stand it. He knows. Here's what Satan knows. Boy, he did not like you knowing this. that if the people who the family, the redeemed family, that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is, what she stands for and that she can do the greater works, she will be an invincible army &gt;&gt; if they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework. work of the Christian church. As long as you are seeing the the impersonation of Christianity is not real Christianity. That the message of the hour brought you real Christianity. As long as you can see that and discern the two spirits. See, and you want to talk about something that an alarms a pastor's heart is to see believers who I know are real believers for real. I know they're children of God. I know they are. Their many years and their testimony proves it. And and I and and their spirit, you know, um I feel it in my spirit. And and then to see them moving into areas and intermingling and rubbing shoulders with things that are the part of the false spirit of the false church. And they're getting easy around that. and they're getting comfortable around that kind of a uh you know because oh well it's the name of Christianity and it's really barely anything more than admiring as brother Brandham said admiring the fine qualities of Jesus who wouldn't is a man to be admired see but that's not the same as being born again see so I'm worried when I see you doing that that you're not discerning the true spirit the two spirits within the framework of the Christian church you already discern the spirit of Christ you know the message is true, but you're failing to understand that that spirit you're rubbing shoulders with that's causing you to dress like the world, act like the world, think like the world, chase after the world, that's the other spirit. So when she stands that she can do the greater works, she'll be an invincible army. If they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the Christian church and by God's spirit discern and withstand, say it with me, withstand the antichrist spirit. Satan, good news. Good news. Satan will be powerless before her. &gt;&gt; You ought to just rejoice. Satan will be powerless before you. He will be as definitely thwarted today in you. I'm add I'm adding that in you as when Christ withstood his every effort to gain power over him in the desert. See, Satan was simply not willing to play second fiddle to you, but he could see it coming. And thus, he's launched his plan today. But God has given you the remedy. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stand to our feet, friends. Amen. Sing for us, brother Matt. &gt;&gt; Cuz I know who you are. [singing and music] &gt;&gt; Oh my. The cross of salvation was only the start. [music and singing] I love that. Now I am chosen, [snorts] free and [music] forgiven. [singing] I have a future [music and singing] &gt;&gt; and it's worth and it's worth the [music] living.

Was born [music] and raised back to life again. That's what it is. I [music] was born. [music] Why would I be a bit in my shame when I found grace? Oh my running my [music] way. I know I am yours. I was [music] paid for more. Hallelujah. [music] You called out my name. &gt;&gt; I'll sing. &gt;&gt; I'll sing out your praise. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [music] &gt;&gt; All together.

Hallelujah. You love the Lord. Are you a believer? Do you believe that you're more than you thought you were? Amen. [music] That's the last thing in the world the devil wants you to accept is what Christ has did for you abs absolutely as an absolute. It's irrevocable. It's unimpeachable. It's already finished in Christ. [music] And he has sent us a word today. And we are identified as believers because our whole life's cry, my whole crowd, my whole heart is Lord, bring me by whatever means necessary. That's a strong prayer. You got to have some faith to pray that because you don't know what all that might mean. Depends on how obstinate you are. But you know something I have found out? I don't trust me to lead me. I don't have confidence me can get me there. And so I just constantly say to the Lord, Lord, I know this. You're all wise. Whatever you do will be in your wisdom. Do whatever [music] you need to do. I just want to be exactly everything the word said I would be. I want to be that no matter what it [music] costs me. No matter what you say, well, what what if it's this? I don't know. But whatever it is, whatever he does, I know he has supreme wisdom and knows it's for my good. What difference will it make 10,000 years from now if you lose something that gets you there? If you have to, you know, make a change, you know, I promise you in 10,000 years, you'll be a happy camper. I promise [music] you, you'll never be sorry. You'll never be left holding the bag or get the short end of the stick when you when you trust in the Lord. Amen. Let's bow our heads across the building. I thank you Lord as I stand [snorts] here today and feel a peace in my heart that what was needed saying was said and I can confess that [music] it all came from you. Nothing came out of my own thinking. There's so much there that is precarious because we don't have all the answers. We have to just lean on what a prophet some of it we don't even understand. I don't even can't even fully get my mind around it. But I know what I'm taught in the scriptures. I can see what it says plainly. I know what a prophet said plainly. My confidence is in there.
