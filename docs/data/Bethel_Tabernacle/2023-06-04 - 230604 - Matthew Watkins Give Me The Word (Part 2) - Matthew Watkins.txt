look we thank you for that pray that you would bless the tithes and offerings Lord we thank you for your presence this morning Lord help us to receive father open our hearts that we could be better Christians when we walk out this morning I ask these things in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen you can have your seat say brother Luther's coming around uh brother Jason asked me to give a little a little update this morning did you get that PowerPoint Ethan if you don't mind putting it up for me I don't know is this thing on how's it work or anything so as many of you as you know that at about a little over a year ago we we we started um talking about doing some updates to the church and I got up before the church and shared the vision of the leadership of the church and that that Vision that the leadership has doesn't do anything if we don't put action to it we is the body and um so I shared this scripture taking ownership of the vision but Proverbs 29:18 where there is no vision that people perish and um we've been a little quiet the last little bit but it isn't because we haven't been working and there's been a lot of work in the background going on and um you know the planning the getting the pricing for the materials getting quotes from the different contractors and subcontractors um and the biggest thing was the the permitting getting that all done well we're about there um I believe next week we're going to we should be having the permits in our hands so therefore we're ready to start phase one of the project and I just put this together you know and um I had many people come to me during this quiet time and we're like where are we at brother Ken and I really didn't have answers other than we're working in the background there's a lot of work going on but the scripture says that to every thing there is a season and a time to every purpose under the heavens well it's that season for us now now is our time and the season to break ground on our new building project so um we're finally ready to move forward with phase one of the construction plans are permitting took us quite a while so phase one uh is going to be the buildout of the fellowship hall um the plan will be to Worship in the Fellowship Hall during the continuing phases of the project um once the once the sanctuary is finished we'll move back into the sanctuary but I want to remind everyone that we'll progress in construction according to everyone's giving so and what we're able to raise as a church because brother Jason is um he's pretty committed to not going into debt as a church and so um if we can if we can move this project along in a timely fashion then um that's our goal is to not to have to get alone and to uh you know raise this within ourselves we've seen it through other churches other believers um have you know offered have given um offerings to us and brother Jason says that there's more out there that want to help with the project but that's all secondary this is our church so we need to we need to do our part God is our provider and he'll provide us the energies he'll provide us the ideas to move forward with those with um you know with with uh fundraisers and he'll he'll bring people to those fundraisers he'll do all that but we have to be an active part of that and I just want to remind everybody that so the per permitting processes complete this coming week and we're ready to pour out the concrete pad for the new Fellowship Hall so June 10th which is next Satur this coming Saturday there'll be a small uh work party just a short one maybe four hours brother Matt said um for site prep we're going to remove um the awning out here the shed and remove some existing plumbing and underground move the HVAC units so forth like that so any brothers that want to come out this Saturday get with Brother Brad and brother Matt let them know that you'll be coming out to help that'll be this Saturday um then on Sunday next Sunday one week from today June 11th we'll be having a special kickoff offering um to ensure that we have enough cash flow to complete this lab we are almost there we are just on the cusp of having enough to complete that with the building fund that we've raised so far so we just need a a little push to get over top and give us a little um cash flow for anything the unforeseen that come up so there's going to be an a special offering taken so and then after that we're going to ask the church for pledges so even if you're not a tithe payer and you want to make a pledge or if you are a tithe payer and you consider this your home church we ask that you would pray about the special offering and about the pledges and the pledges are meant to say yes this is my home church this is the ministry God has me under and I see the need for um some improvements and maybe some um you know growth in our in our size of uh space and um I want to be behind that so the pledges are going to be um private we're not going to say $50 anyone $50 anyone $25 it's what you can afford a month but what we do want what we do need is for everybody next Sunday brother Luther will have a little piece of paper and he's going to give every every person that comes in the door or every tithe pay uh family member uh a slip of paper and what we would like you to do is being honest and what the Lord has given you just write an amount we don't have to write your name you don't have to write nothing else just an amount that you can that you feel that you can give over and above the giving that you're doing now so we don't want to rob from Peter to give to Paul in other words if you're giving $25 a week or $100 a month in offerings don't back off and give $75 a month in offerings and 25 to the building fund because that doesn't that doesn't solve the problem um so this is over and above everything that you're doing now some of us won't be able to do as much as others but that's where you'll have your opportunity to be involved more with the fundraising if you have more time than you do money to help then get involved with the fundraising um yeah and so with that little piece of paper you'll write it on there and at the end of service you'll drop it there'll be a little box in the back drop your paper in the box and this is just so that the trustees have a number to work with on when they build a when they when they're building their you know their project plan and their schedules and all that they'll have an idea of the funds that are going to be coming in every month and when you do that that that amount make sure it's a monthly amount not a weekly amount a monthly amount um and brother Jason would also like to have a dedication of the property in addition uh before the actual concrete por so once this slab is ready all the once all the site work is done out here this Saturday and then we're ready to move forward with the poor um we'll we'll have the church assemble brother Jason will announce a date or a time brother Matt or brother Jason will and we're going to invite the whole church and anyone else who's interested in coming for the dedication we're going to dedicate the the new addition and and all the work moving forward to the Lord because it's his it's not ours and um brother Jason and brother Matt will determine that time and date uh soon okay so here we have je Jehovah Gyra he's still our provider and I just listed out some of the things that you know he's going to provide through our giving our fundraising ideas our fundraising activ ity and other giving we must play our part and walk in the vision so that all being said if you have an idea of a fundraising um opportunity that you would like to not head up or if you want to head it up you can if there's some idea you have write it down I've had a lot of people come up to me and just tell me their ideas but then I got to go back and remember it and write it down so I'm pretty busy and that makes it difficult sometimes I make uh I'll forget or I'll just won't write it down right if you have an idea we'd appreciate you to write your ideas down bring it to me or brother Matt or brother Jason we'll we'll um move forward with those but we really wanna we really want to start to move forward with that we bu we did a big buildup of that and then we didn't realize that there was I guess we realized it but we thought maybe the Lord would get behind it move it faster but again this is all God's timing not our timing so I just want to say thank you for your time God bless you and Shalom amen and that's uh that's the final project amen all right thank you Ethan all right brother John [Music] oh I've heard a thousand stories of why they think you're like but I've heard the tender Whispers of love the dead of night and you tell me that you're pleased and that I'm never [Music] alone you're a good good father it's who you are it's who you are it's who you are and I'm loved by

that on uh when we come to the house of God well that's right we should we should always do everything we can to move apart move aside anything but don't miss the house of God Amen that should be the first uh thing on our priority list in our day amen as the house of God and I believe a real believer you don't have to beg them to come to church they'd rather be there than anywhere else amen so we have that also brother Bob black who's here today will be ministering for us on Father's Day uh that is the 18th am I right on that think it is the 18th amen and so I thinkk that was all my

who's not here today he's ministering to a little church uh in Georgia actually having uh foot washing and communion there with them a church that lost their Pastor apparently or or sick I think too sick to minister so are you glad to be here in the house of the Lord amen this is our portion amen our opportunity and our chance to Worship the Lord I want to say Lord I want to give you everything that I've got amen for he's completely worthy of everything that we have amen let's turn to the Book of Ezekiel chapter two if you have your Bible I'm just going to minister to you here out of this book and as catch this we have a few Services coming up Lord willing uh I'll be speaking this Sunday uh Wednesday this coming Wednesday um and then so I think the next Sunday as well so we have a little bit of um well brother Matt that's a good reason that means you don't have to be so long-winded this morning you have plenty of services to stretch your thought out so uh and I say Amen Lord will you pray for me the Lord will help me do that I realized a long time ago I'm not a I'm not a good preacher brother Brandon said a good preacher holds a sermon you know about 30 40 minutes and I saidwell I'm not a good preacher and I uh I want to be a better one though I'm striving to be a better one amen this morning verse two I'm going to minister to you and I'm I took a thought a title a couple Sundays ago give me the word we're going to preach part two of give me the word and he said listen let's just begin reading here at verse one and he said unto me son of man stand up stand upon thy feet and I will speak unto thee now Isaiah or Ezekiel sorry had fellen fall to had fell to his feet you know people talk about brother Matt do you believe in being slain in The Spirit Well ananas and saf were slain in the spirit quite literally you want to be slain in the spirit have Peter as your pastor and lie about how much money you put in the offering plate you'll get slain in the spirit but this kind of slain in the spirit is completely different actually the presence of God has the power to to literally knock a person down to their feet and that's the power of God now that that people can can get an in an emotional realm and God moves through an emotional realm but this is literally the glory or the awe or the presence of God that has knocked Ezekiel down to his feet and God says get back up I'm not finished talking to you got more to say notice here in verse two and the spirit entered into me when he spake unto me now that's important not education not intellect not academic understanding but God but Ezekiel is going to speak and what's going to fuel what the words he's going to speak is not understanding or what he learns or even what he felt emotionally but the spirit of God is going to enter into his body and speak out of his mouth I want to say Lord let me be a vessel that can be that can the Lord can speak to me enter inside of me and then speak out of me and he said and he set me upon my feet that I heard him that spake unto me and he said unto me son of man I send thee to the children of Israel to a rebellious nation that hath rebelled against me they and their fathers have transgressed against me even unto this very day for they are impudent children and stiffe hearted I do send thee unto them and thou shalt say unto them thus saith the Lord God and they notice whether they will hear or whether they will forbear for they are a rebellious house yet shall know that there hath been a prophet among them now notice there's a very big difference in distinction that God makes of hearing the word of God literally physically through your eardrums and you hear a voice and when you hear the word of God into your heart because when you really hear the word of God you heed the word of God and he says and whether they will hear whether they will forbear verse six and thou son of man be not afraid of them Be not Afraid wait wait wait wait this isn't Hittites and jebusites this isn't even Nebuchadnezzar this isn't the Assyrians this is the condition of church for the Israelites God is actually having to tell his preacher don't be afraid of the people now you want to talk about a Jezebel spirit brother Bram said what is a Jezebel spirit it's when a spirit gets upon people to try to control by pressure or attitude what the preacher preaches from the pull pit I say God keep that away from us and now son of man be not afraid of them neither be afraid of their words though briers and thorn be with thee and thou doest dwell among scorpions be not afraid of their words nor be dismayed at their looks though they be a rebellious house Lord Jesus we just take Lord everything that we have here this morning God and we as a people as a group Lord I stand in here amongst them Lord who am I father to address or to stand Lord here before your children I'm counted Lord as just one of them Lord as we stand here before your holy word Lord and we don't approach it today father from a an opinion Lord or from idea that we have Lord father but we check all of our ideas we lay them and surrender down all of our opinions Lord and God we want to become subservient to your word this morning I pray God that you would take every Spirit Lord that's in this building today under your control for the glory of God use my vessel Lord use the words that I'll speak father to bring freedom to your children we humble ourselves now together Lord in your house father we're so grateful to be pull up a chair Lord that's what we want to do this morning just to pull up a chair to your table and dine Lord as your guest you've invited us Lord God and we're so grateful to be here in your presence now God May you come Lord as you always do so faithful Lord and may you move me the speaker out of the way Lord and those that are your bride Lord this morning Sons and Daughters of God May father we may you allow us Lord to remove every distraction to remove every kind of hindrance Lord that maybe would get in the way from us hearing your voice clearly and reing God may we surrender now to it Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen you can be seated I want you just to look very closely with me in this chapter that we're reading out of Ezekiel chapter 2 and I'm just going to take a few more verses I just want you to read them carefully as it weighs so much upon my heart in this thought and the burden that the Lord has put upon me uh for this morning's service and what we'll carry over in the coming Services just pick it up here again at verse 6 together if you have your Bible uh just open that up if you could and your phone if that's your Bible you got permission to open it up there as well and those that don't have either you can look on the screen look at verse 6 thou son of man be not afraid of them neither be afraid of their words though briers and Thorns be with thee and thou does dwell among scorpions be not afraid of their words nor be dismayed at their looks though they be a rebellious house and thou shalt speak my words unto them whether they will hear or whether they will forbear for they are most rebellious he repeats these words to Ezekiel and he says whether they will hear or whether they will forbear for they are most rebellious this is the condition that the prophet of God is going to have to speak to these people and God says here in verse 7 Thou shalt speak my words unto them and he says in verse n and when I looked behold I hand notice this and behold a hand was sent unto me and lo a roll of a book was therein now it's pretty amazing when you study the Book of Ezekiel and you find here and you could read the first parts of this book and then the latter the very first parts of this book start off so Bleak and Isaiah or Ezekiel sorry is coming and and everything just feels to have such a negative connotation and that's really very much like uh The Book of Ezekiel at the very first few chapters because of the rebellion and because of the condition of this nation and then later on we we're going to look here in just a moment that God sends uh Nebuchadnezzar and he sends the Assyrians and they take the northern 10 tribes and then they come later and the the last two remaining tribes of Benjamin are captured and taken into ultimate captivity but and then Ezekiel changes his entire prophecy pH y you know the prophecy or the words that are being spoken by the Oracle of God is always going to be determined by the condition or the need that's in God's family now I hope you heard me this morning I hope you're not distracted because I'm just going to lay some very key principles to this thought that I'm preaching to you the Oracle or the prophet or the ministry that God puts inside of a body put to a nation it put a prophet and God the words that would come from that from the Throne of God to the heart of that Prophet that he would speak to those people would always be based upon what he would say would be determined by the condition or the need that God seen rising in the nation that he was going to speak to and so anytime that God's people are in consecration anytime God's people are in are in Consecration and dedication to the to the Lord and and the fathers are in their place and mothers are in their place and and and the people of God or have a repentant heart and they're in tune with the heart and the mind of God then the prophecy or the message that would come across uh the Oracle of God to the people would be words of encouragement it'd be words of of Hope it'd be words of Thanksgiving and he would say no weapon formed against you shall prosper for I am the Lord of hosts who shall defend you and rebuke the devour for your sake I'll pour out a blessing upon you that the W that the the windows I'll open the windows of Heaven heaven and I'll pour out a blessing upon which you can't even contain you say why were some of those words spoken to God's people because the condition of the people were in tune to receive a blessing and so anytime your life is in tune or in harmony or in dedication or consecration to uh to the Lord then you're lining yourself up for God to send a blessing to your life and and even send a miracle to your life but oh quite the contrary when our life is like many of us here today and I stand as just one one amongst uh all of us here when our life is in disarray or disharmony with the word of God or we're out of sync with the plan of God or our lives are not in in in harmony with the spirit of God let me just say that friends your life can become in harmony or out of harmony with the word of the Lord and you can be a Christian and be a believer and love the Lord and have the table have the Bible in your home and have the message books are scattered all over your home and and have all of the pictures and know all of the know all know all of the ideas and and and be as much a Believer as as Abraham was a believer in the faith of God but be Out Of Tune and out of sink and out of harmony with what the spirit of the Lord has saying and when you're when our lives become misaligned and that that when our lives become out of Harmony or out of syn with the with the spirit of the Lord and our lives begin to get what US call it what it is backsliding from the presence of God and church is not important and prayer is not important and listening to the to the tapes of God's Prophet become a third and fourth priority and and church attendance becomes a fifth and sixth priority and and prayer meeting uh on Thursday night becomes a 10th or 11th priority when though when when when these kind of things get out of Sinker out of Harmony of Our Lives we're not setting ourselves up to receive a blessing from the Lord but we're setting ourselves up to receive chastisement and correction and a curse upon our life you say God will bring a curse upon my life absolutely there's a law of tithing and there's either a a law that comes of blessing or cursing that comes upon your life hello and so you you do you do we realize that our conduct our activity our Behavior where we are in the har of the of God's program determine whether we are setting ourselves up for a miracle or setting ourselves up for a catastrophe you'll never find this more true in Ezekiel and I'm preaching to you on give me the word and you're going to see here just in a moment why we've why we're carrying on in This Book of Ezekiel but it's a it's an amazing parallel uh to to the to the word of God that you find the the law of contrast in the law of God of blessing and csing and and Ezekiel uh starts off his book and he shows a he shows a side of God's character that most people don't like to look at if I'm being honest here today I'd even go as far as to say that I don't like to look at that my human nature doesn't like to look at this side of God we want to look and and Fa and and focus on the good things and we want the blessings of God and we want the The Hope and the and the joy and and just give me give me give me give me because that's how our nature is our carnal nature we don't like to see the severity of the C of of the the severity of God but let me just remind you in Romans 11:22 the Apostle Paul actually picks up and shows the law of contrast that you will never know who God truly is until you see both sides of God you will never truly know the the character or the nature of your Heavenly Father until you see the severity and the goodness you can't just have the goodness and not the severity you got to have the severity with as we've preached here before you'll never understand the grace of God until you know the wrath of God you'll never know the diamond when that Jeweler puts that beautiful Diamond 10 karat diamond and you're looking at the beauty it's just glistening and sparkling listen You'll never see the real beauty of that diamond until that Jeweler puts a black velvet cloth and he sticks that diamond over top of that black velvet and behind the black wrath you can see the beauty of the diamond and until you know the severity you'll never know the grace Paul says in Romans 11:22 behold therefore the goodness and severity somebody say this with me let's read this verse together behold therefore let's read this verse together behold therefore the goodness and severity of God so Paul says upon those who fail severity but towards the goodness if thou continue in his goodness amen otherwise thou also sh be cut off now this is applies to our lives friends upon those who fail severity in other words what's he saying the the the the the blessing or the cursing or what is with the what what you are setting yourself up for severity or goodness will be based upon your conduct and he says if thou continue isn't we always always these ifs in the Bible but we stop reading short of those ifs if goodness to thee we read that and we say but but but goodness uh he says on them which fell severity but towards thee goodness close the Bible that's all I needed to read I don't need to read anything else if thou continue in his goodness amen there's always this law of give and take even in the book of Jude you know the B that there comes that Bible where it says that that verse in Judah uh way down towards the end of the book of Jude that last little book book before Revelations and he says he says uh unto God who is able to keep thee from falling and we say praise God he's able to keep me we love quoting those verses uh go God who is able to keep that which I have committed unto him right we love those verses the god who's the keeper but do you realize right before God says unto him who's able to keep thee right before that he says keep yourselves in the love of God so God says keep yourselves and God will be able to keep you the Apostle Paul says he's he's able to keep that which I have committed unto him but just a few verses before that he says I have kept the faith so Paul says behold the goodness and the severity on the on them which fail severity but towards thee goodness if thou continue I want to continue in his goodness amen and so Ezekiel comes to this amazing parallel and it's you can always approach the Bible and as we said we love to hear our nature loves to hear about the goodness we don't like to hear about the severity now it's the same exact way if you're a legalistic person you love the severity of God and you listen if you only focus on the Book of Ezekiel and you only get the severity you'll never know the goodness and let me just say you've got to know both you've got to know I want to say I I want to know all of God I want to know every part of God I don't just want to Center and focus in the devil or always try to get us to focus in on one thing to keep us from the whole thing oh I just want to say Lord don't let the devil distract me on one thing let me see it all let me see all of the plan of God let me see all of the picture of God don't let me ever get into one side and a ditch over here only to miss the middle of the road and then get on the middle of the road you know how how many times this is the tactic of the enemy to push us into ditches to keep us on extremes and out of the middle of the road I'll even go as far as to say don't you realize that's exactly been the tactic of the devil in the in the end time trying to get people to focus and major on one thing and fail to see the other thing but listen Paul said I've not shun to declare unto you the whole counsil of God so it's not not either one you can you can you can cut out one thing and miss the other that's the tactic of the devil you can cut out the love of God and only see the severity of God you could cut out the severity and only see the love but I believe the real true bride of Christ let me just say I believe a True Believer says God I want everything that you are I want all of your character I want all of your word I don't just want a piece of it or a portion of it or a favorite pet Doctrine over here favorite thing I like to hear I want to say God I open up my heart to receive all of the person of Christ I welcome him into my life I welcome him into my home I welcome him into my church I want to say Lord I want to welcome the fullness of the word oh I'm not just preacher just for a moment I don't want to cut out any part of God I don't want to I don't want to sell myself short of any piece of the Holy Spirit I want all of the Holy Ghost some people just like to feel him I like to feel him I also like to know him right here you say in your mind I like to know him in my mind the devil puts enough in your mind I want to fill up my mind with the word of God the thoughts of God the knowledge of God the word of God and I don't want to camp down or or focus on one thing I you know the seaa effect I'm just following the Holy Spirit here this morning the seol effect will always push you to the other side and when you see something so out of line and so wrong and so over to the devil will always put a scarecrow in order to balance that out you go to The Other Extreme all right I'm going to take off my jacket so I can fight you'll always go to The Other Extreme that's the tactic of the devil to make you extreme now I believe a real believer of God is an extreme person they're extremely in love with God they're extremely passionate about the Holy Spirit they're extremely passionate about the word of God they're extreme in the way that they live because they love they serve a god who's very detail oriented and what's pleasing and what's not pleasing to him but it's the tactic of the devil to always push us to one side of the other and we always if if we see it going too wrong this way in our family to correct that we'll put some harsh measures to try to correct it if you're not careful you overcorrect and many times it's the overcorrection that ends you up leads you your car flipped over in a ditch not going off the road and veering off onto the and you know many times in our life Our Life Starts going sideways and that's what we hear and things are falling apart and children are backsliding and the home's falling apart and there's arguments and hostility in the home and and suddenly your health is attacked and your body's attacked your business is and what is it and that suddenly because of that that instability to bring an overcorrection or to correct it we go extreme and go to the other side and that overcorrection causes us more Calamity than going off the road in the first place ever would have many times if you'll just let go if you if you'll just keep your hands on the wheel and slow down all right that's for somebody that devil always wants us to teeter totter on one way or the other to go the opposite way why do you think there would be a movement trying to come and attack our message of push play and Obey why do you think that there would be such a movement H that that the devil has tried to launch an assault of all you need is tapes and all you need to do on Sunday mornings as a good preacher five-fold ministry will point the people back to the tapes and they'll play a tape they'll shut up they'll sit down they won't preach their own idea their own thought We Don't Preach our idea our own thought we say what the tape says but why do you think there'd be a movement trying to get us to push play so that the True Believer as a reaction of that will then deemphasize the tape because it's always the tactic of the devil to push us into ditches you see some who have cut out emotion and say we don't need emotion we just need the word the word and the word only it's just the word of God away with experiences for measuring line they'll use all of their favorite little things that brother bam said that that feed into their pet doctrine of their or their idea well away with experiences we don't need any kind of you can have the Holy Ghost all the days of your life and still go to hell yeah brother brandham said that but brother brandham very clearly taught that that what he was referring to what comes on your flesh to a Pentecost who would speak in tongues and he says I've seen Devils speak in tongues but it's what's on your soul that's important he wasn't saying that you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost in your soul and go to hell brother bam said you can't be lost no more than God could be lost that's the Assurance of the believer but what would the devil try to get us to do he would try to Major on something we don't need any gifts of the Spirit anymore that was the that that which is perfect is when that which is perfect has come that which is in part is done away with which is a completely Mis misapplied scripture totally completely if that's the case then at the that the time when the Apostle spoke that then there would have been no more miracles or that no more gifts or no more prophecies or no more tongues but yet there was we've seen some cut out emotion others say we don't need to teach the word of God anymore we don't need teaching we just need redac screaming and and I'm all for that listen it's my preference to have inspired preaching and to have inspired men of God who preach with a burden that's I believe I believe a real teacher teaches from a burden but to say that all we need is one kind and one type and listen don't you realize God's a god of variety God is a god of variety okay Lord I'm here and you I'm just going to follow you now God's a god of variety 1 Corinthians 12411 now there are diversities of gifts somebody say diversities there are diversities meaning that not everyone is the same not all of us are the same same not all of us not even even ministers are not all the same the preaching that you heard uh Wednesday night brother Brad is different brother brother Joe Howell is different brother Matthew's different our pastor's different brother Jason's different God uses different gifts because there's div there's diversities of gifts and you don't just need one you need them all my goodness I never not one time did I ever come to Christmas and only pick the biggest largest gift that I thought was the greatest and say I don't need any of the rest of them and just leave them covered up and never open them up and only take that one has anybody here ever done that no what do you do you take all of the gifts you open up every single one of them you but but because why because they're all for you someone bought them for you someone thought of you and said you need this and God said I'm gonna send you not just one not just one style not just one gift I'm going to give you gifts to the body there's diversities but here's the important part this is 1 Corinthians 12:4 there are diversities of gifts but the same someone say it with me the Same Spirit notice and there are differences of Administrations but the same Lord hallelujah there are diversities of operations but it is the same God which worketh all in all but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit with all so who is the manifestation of the spirit given to the preacher just the preacher just the pastor just the musician just the Deacon just the you know just the officer no the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit with all for to one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom to another the word of knowledge by The Same Spirit to another Faith by The Same Spirit to another the gifts of healing by The Same Spirit to another the working of Miracles to another prophecy to another Discerning of spirits to what are you saying brother Matt what are you seeing brother M I'm seeing that God didn't just put all the gifts right here behind this desk but I'm looking at a many membered body and God says to you I gave this gift to you I gave this gift to you I gave this gift I want to say Lord let me recognize the gift you've put in my life and let me operate to profit for the whole body to another tongues diverse kinds of Tong tongues to another interpretation of tongues uh ver verse 11 and he says uh uh let me find my place here to another working of Miracles prophecy another to get to another interpretation but all these worketh that one and the self Same Spirit am dividing to every every every every man am listen this is is not a preacher's Revival hello somebody help me preach this morning this is not just a prophet's Revival God sent a message but let me tell you something God never intended to bottle up nor did brother brandom ever intend to bottle up all of the authority and all of the Power and all of the gifts and all of the supernatural in his own vessel but he longed to see a church he said show me a church where every move is thus sayith the Lord I'll show you a messiah upon the Earth I'll show you a light in the end time that can shine its light from the little housewife all the way to the back door to the front door to the pull pit I'll show you a church that's moving and breathing and living by the power of God a body full of gifts and he says dividing to every man severly as he will see God he's not Sears and robu Harmony God has things I love this God has things he's a god of variety he likes people redheaded blackheaded just looks like that down he says they he says God God God made men white he made men black he made them yellow he made them Brown let them alone he made red flowers white flowers pink flowers don't you see it's the world agenda that tries to push everybody and say you're all the same that's a spirit of the devil and brother brandom said that Spirit of unity Mis Unity Unity with Satan's kingdom will lead the churches denominational churches to the mark of the beast by the World by the World Council of churches that we're all the one we're all one we're all the same let me just say this you're not like them I'll say it again because that might have hurt and and brother bandam said it this way sometimes you got to say it again to clinch the nail you're not like them don't ever let the devil tell you you're like them you're different oh listen I might have a stubborn person who's been in the message 30 40 years let me preach it to the Young Generation you're not like them you're different You're A peculiar people you're a royal priesthood a chosen generation you're not any better than them but you're not them you're God's elected bride you have something different on the inside of you you're not the same don't ever let the devil tell you that you're the same you're not the same God God makes a difference he puts a difference do you believe that this morning God makes a difference I'm just going to read you something here and I just feel the leading of the holy spirit so just just give me a moment just to find this you notice here you're not the same as them listen to what listen to what brother bandom says here and he says see he's a god of he's the god of variety that's the way leave it alone you go to tampering with nature you pervert it just leave it the way it is it's always better other words don't try to be me and I won't try to be you brother Maron made this comment he and he makes it over and over and over again through the message he said God dealt with Israel as a nation but he deals with his gentile people as individuals that's powerful you got to be so careful with that he dealt with with Israel as a nation but he deals with Gentile his elected as individuals you say brother mat thought we believed in harmony we do thought we believed in the unity of the church we do so long as each individual agrees to the word We're In Harmony but when one individual if it's the pastor if it's brother Matt if it's if it's the Deacon I don't care if it's your daddy or your mama when they disagree with the word you're no longer a unified group God isn't going to Rapture us as a church Bethal Tabernacle is not taking a churchwide Revival it's not taking a churchwide Rapture it won't be a churchwide body change all right we're in somewhere now it's not a churchwide Rapture it's not a message wide Rapture because you stream this brother and you're listen friends God it's the tactic of the devil to try to make us all unified under one one click or one group or one clan I'm part of this listen I'm glad to be part of this church I'm glad I got friends and family but I don't belong to any of you and you don't belong to me I belong to Jesus Christ I have one person who has my allegiance I am faithful to one person and that's his word word and if you leave the word I leave you and I say if I leave the word you ought to leave me if listen friends God says I I come to bring a sword that sword cuts through families cuts through mothers and fathers brothers and sisters I believe in unity but I believe that Unity comes under the revealed word of the hour and when you disagree with the revealed word of the hour I leave you hello come on some somebody help me preach now we find out bam he couldn't see it he went and looked under the people now just a minute we're great big people up here we're just scattered we're just a scattered Bunch we all believe the same that's true they all believe the same God they all worship Jehovah look at balam's sacrifice even brother Brandon begins to deal with this with Moses J of and balum and balum says you know what let's just build seven altars brother Manon said see fundamentally he was right seven altars representing seven churches uh it it all looked good it sounded like the message of the hour sounded good bam Brother s said let's build seven altars fundamentally he was just as fundamentally fundamentally right as Moses was you see you say then what was the difference the pillar of fire was the difference you say what was the difference their teaching no what was the difference their intellect no their charisma no their gift No in fact balam was a very Gifted Man in so much he Enchanted all of God's people he was charismatic he was gifted he was listen friends it doesn't matter how charismatic or how gifted a person is or how eloquent they speak you don't judge a man by how much he shouts or screams or how anointed you think he is you judging by the word of God this is your only measuring line you're judgeing by the word that's why Paul says be careful of the spirits for there are many spirits false Spirits have gone out into the world so try the spirits see whether they be of God or not you say brother man how we going to try them we've got a word and we've got a Vindicated interpretation of this word that means you don't need my opinion you don't need a brother a down the street that you can listen to on the internet you've got the Vindicated voice of God that's already revealed the word of God and you judge it by that amen we believe the same fundamentally he was right but what was difference there was a Divine Vindication upon Moses they were both prophets but under Moses's Ministry there was a pillar of fire there was a light that hung on you think that Pillar of Fire brother Bram has taken his the photograph is taken in Houston Coliseum of the Angel of the lord of the pillar of fire the the same fire that was over Moses over the children of Israel was photographed in a picture listen friends do you realize that's not the only time the pillar of fire brother Brandon would over and over and tape and say you know that picture that you see of that Pillar of Fire and you see that picture he says I see it right now in the audience that same Pillar of Fire that's in that picture is right now hanging over that person over there on the back row what was the difference he said there was a supernatural Pillar of Fire a light that hung with the camp there was Divine Healing there was a shout of the king in the camp Great Signs Divine Healing wonders and things performed among them it was a sign of a living God among his people fundamentally they were both right and so what did Bam try to do he tried to persuade them look guys we're all the same we all serve Jehovah you guys don't have to be so weird why you got to make yourself so odd I you got to make yourself so different because God said we're different why you got to make yourself so OD because God said you're my peculiar treasure it's like a man who finds a treasure there's all kinds of treasures but when he finds that peculiar one it's different than all of the rest it doesn't mean the rest isn't treasure it just means he found his treasure and he says why you why come on guys you don't need to be so odd we're all the same we all quote from the same Bible we all read the same words well listen we all believe in the deity of Jesus Christ as long as we agree upon that aren't we Brothers as long as we all agree as long as we all long as we all Quote the same Prophet long as we all wear the same clothes and look the same fundamentally they they look the same fundamentally they was both right and so balam Bewitched the people why how could Israel get to such a place that they were Bewitched by a gift that God put in the man's life you say God put that gift in balam's life every good gift comes from God the Father of Lights and so he bewitches them because why you say brother Matt how could God's family become Bewitched by a false prophet because they got their eyes off of the word and they started looking to a man right Amen brother math that's the truth they got their eyes off of the word listen when you take your eyes off the word you're opening yourself up to receive any kind of spirit I say keep your eyes on the word keep your eyes on what's Vindicated keep your eyes on what the pillar of fire has backed up they got their eyes off of the word and they started look into a gift and he bewitches them you say when did this happen brother Matt just 3 days before they cross into the promised land imagine three more days of following the Vindicated word and they would have ended up in the promised land but three days before they cross over a bewitching spirit tells the people to get your eyes off the word and start looking at a gift I heard that brother Luther amen I heard that online too God bless you thank you amen say Amen to the word of God he says but now he says I I've read he says but now I'm afraid this is a hard listen what brother random says this is 1965 modern events made clear by prophecy but now I'm afraid he says this is a hard statement to make and one of these days I'll be shot for it you say brother Matt what did that ever happen it's happening today remember this the churches are being Bewitched am now this is what brother bam says was going to get him shot the churches not this not not the bars not those there on the street not the Heathen but the churches from the pull pits you see the pull pits the weakening of the pull pits has been Satan's number one goal if he can weaken the pull pit if he can shut the mouth of the preacher to dilute the word of God it would change and affect the people in such a way to where they're Bewitched by an evil spirit he says there're being Bewitched forgive me for keeping tucking my shirt and I lost some weight since I bought this suit trying to keep this belt nice and cinched up he says the churches are being Bewitched and he says by The ecumenical council he's taking you right into it to say you're the same group you're not the he says yeah you're you're just the same the prophet of God cries out and says you're not the same group come out from among that stuff and be separated or to keep away from that stuff as far as you can from it and I believe a real believer won't Buck against that or fight against that or or resist that kind of preach him a real believer will say Amen brother Matt I want to stay far away from it amen keep away from that stuff as far as you can from it you say brother Matt why cuz you don't need it listen to me Church of the Living God you don't need it you've got all that you need in the word you've got all that you need for a body change it's laying down on side of the seed show us the father it will suffice us brother random says everything that you have need of for this life's journey is already in the seat of God that's been quickened by the baptism of the Holy Ghost even the body change I say hallelujah you say then what do I got to do just believe the word Sarah believe who made the promise is able to keep the promise stop looking at your circumstances and look to the word stop looking at what you feel and look to the word I say stop looking at what you feel or you don't feel stop looking at what you think or you don't think and what comes in your mind and look to the unfailing word of God and he says how can to this listen brother balum says you know what we're we're the same let's marry let's intermar let's just let our children marry together after all we believe the same God I'm going to give you very simple words of Jesus how can two walk together unless they be agreed how can you walk with God you say walk with God how do you walk with God and disagree with his word you can't you're kidding yourself you're lying to yourself you've deceived yourself if you say you walk with God and deny any part of his word you don't walk with God I don't doubt you walk with a religious spirit I don't doubt you walk with a with a spiritual spirit I don't doubt any of that but what's the proof brother random says give it the word test you say that's not just to your brother and your sister no that's not to your brother and sister that's to you that's to me that's why the Bible says make your call in an election sure see whether you be in the faith or not I say it's high time we reckon ourselves with the word of God and say Lord is my life lining up with the word am I intertwined am I in agreement does my life walk with the word or is there a part of me that doesn't want to see that side of God amen amen brother renom says how can you add Creeds when you're ordained not to do it and commanded not to do it you can't do it there's no way of doing it brother or sister you can't mix that leaven with the unleavened oil and water won't mix Darkness and Light Won't mix hear me young person Darkness and Light Won't mix you want the word of God in your life then pour your life pour the word of God into your life you want the power of God in your life you can't mix it with the evil things of the world and expect the power of God o water won't mix and let me just say this light is so much more powerful than Darkness man light is so much more powerful than Darkness you let the light of the Gospel of Jesus Christ shine in your heart and watch what things will take place in your life it'll overtake all of the darkness the devil has poured in you for 20 years it'll dispel all of your doubts and all of your complexes and all of the all of the the things that you hate about yourself let the light of the word come in your heart accept the word of God in its fullness say brother Matt but I've done that I've accepted the Lord Jesus I've accepted him with all of my heart oh brother Brandon preaches a message door inside of doors doors and door doors indoor he takes that man of the pic the famous painter who's painted that picture of Jesus outside knocking on the heart and the man says you painted it all wrong that you there those there's no latch on the door and the painter says no no that's exactly how I've meant to paint it you see the latch is on the inside he knocks but you've got to let him in he knocks but you've got to say Amen the word of God is preached but you've got to say I believe it do you understand it no I don't understand it did hurt your feelings it might have hurt my feelings a little bit did it make you mad I'll be honest it might have made me a little bit upset but I'm still going to raise my hand and say I believe it Lord I accept you Lord I welcome your word Into My Heart Lord he can never be Lord until you welcome him many people will welcome an idea they'll welcome a Creed the welcome a religion the welcome even a dress code but they won't really welcome Jesus and brother BR says and you and he says you imagine if I went to your house and he says now now there's doors inside of door once you open that door to the Lord Jesus and he says when you go inside of a person's heart your heart my heart this morning you want to have a heart surgeon tell you about your heart let him diagnose you brother brandom says when you go inside that human heart and you open that heart up up you say I've opened my heart up that's all I got to do is just accept the Lord Brother mat I raised my hands I came to an altar I said Lord I accept you as my savior that's all I've got to do brother Bron says no no no no no don't stop there many people stop there and he says but if you open that door and it says and you walk inside the heart and he says look over to the right on the right's another door and he said and that's the door of Pride and he says and we've all got that door of Pride that Pride that raises up and says I don't like what's being preached that's not what that that's not what I think that's that's not what I oh you can accept everything that you agree with you can accept everything that you understand but the things that hearder you don't understand you raise your fold your arms and go I don't know about that I'll just tune that preacher out say brother Matt do people do that oh man they do that I you say how do you know that cuz I know I've done it before say brother the Matt you trans being transparent enough absolutely let the let let the word of God come to you and and and and sharply correct something that maybe you're proud over are you wanted to hold on to so bad and something raises up within you and says I don't know that's a little bit much I think I'll stick with what I you know what you're doing you're allowing Pride to get in the way of welcoming the Lord into your house and brother ROM says there's that little door of Pride and you tune him out you don't want to hear that you just tune that voice out and he says then you go into that little door that little door of Pride and he says and you watch people we had this but I don't want to even take the time I'm just all over the place so just forgive me this morning but brother random says he says in that message do is and door in Slide Five and he says maybe you might say preacher I just did that I I opened my heart I let Jesus come in I did that 10 years ago I 20 years ago well that may be exactly right but is that all you done I want to ask you now if you would invite somebody in your house and then when you got inside the door somebody invited you rather say come in now listen to what brother bandam says you invite them to your house and then they knock on your door and you say come in and he says that's the way a lot of people accept Christ see I belong to church I belong to so and so down here where Dr PHL belongs you know that's the biggest church the mayor goes there everything you know I belong to that church they let him in just that much yeah I'll accept him see for a personal game but when he says but but what then when Jesus comes into the heart many people accept him because they don't want to go to heaven hell but when Jesus comes into your heart he wants to be Lord not just a savior but Lord also Lord is rulership amen he comes in to take over I believe a real believer says take over Lord take over Lord take over my mouth take over my mind take over my wardrobe take over every thought that oh hands you better keep going up if you really want to welcome the Lord in you say Lord I welcome you to every part of me I lay aside everything I might have thought before and I welcome the word in my life if it comes to correct me to cut me then I welcome the word brother Ron says and you knocked at the door I looked outside yes come on in if you can help he says well if you can help me what well he says you do so but now when you come in now now I don't want you meddle around in my house you stand right there at the door this is about as far as some people get I've accepted amen I go to church don't I I say I believe the message don't I I say I accept God sent a prophet don't I but do you do you invite the Lord do you welcome the whole word into your heart even the the parts you understand and the parts you don't understand even the parts your carnal nature agrees with and the parts that your carnal nature disagrees with do you welcome all of the word or do you just hold him at Bay right there yeah come on in I don't want you meddle around nothing in my house you stand right there at the door now inside the human heart there's many little doors little doors covers up a lot of things just just let him in that isn't all of it when he does come in them brother ROM says he says this in the message thirst them disciples couldn't understand it but they believed it that's right if you can't if you believe it I can't understand many things I believe it anyhow because God said it was so brother ROM says them disciples couldn't understand it knowledge you know Satan's gospel is knowledge did you know that he preached it in the Garden of Eden to Eve and she was deceived by his knowledge of God by his knowledge gospel and has polluted the whole human race with it they've took educational programs put them in the church they're all right though he says they're all right out there but not in God's word no sir you don't know God by education you don't know by knowing and learning mathematics and pronouncing big words Paul was a smart was a smart man but when he come to Christ and received the Holy Spirit went to the Corinthians he said I never come to you with enticing words of man's Wisdom wisdom though he could have done it he said I come to you in the power and manifestation of the Holy Ghost that your faith would be in God not in the wisdom of some man now sometimes we make the church programs they also call their pastor church goes to vote the pastor they say well this pastor now he's got two degrees in college he learned four years of psychology he took this that and the other and they'll vote that kind of a man in why instead of a pastor who believes in God's word being inspired and being God and will preach the word regardless of how people feel about it God told Ezekiel he said preach that whether they believe it or not you preach it anyhow whether they accept it or not they didn't accept Jesus he went right on preach and see it's just the same and if a real Pastor will really preach the word and believe in God they try to bring little intellect the man who's got the best education the man who can stand in the pulpit and take just about 15 minutes so they can go home right quick and go do something else oh oh so you mean that spirit that gets on me in church when I go man how long much longer is he going to be you mean that came from the pits of hell yeah how much longer can we get you give me somebody that'll just preach me a 15minute sermon brother B says go home right quick Ricky can get his hot ride and start out and they can go to twist parties and everything oh it's just nothing else but a hybrid educational pollution just exactly what is right that's right but what is it what is it why do they do that because it satisfies their taste it satisfies a worldly Church member's taste oh but can I just stay say this to you it don't satisfy a believer's taste it don't satisfy a real bride member of Jesus Christ she says give me the word give me all of the word don't give me some educational system give me the power of God demonstrated by the quickening power oh how many Believers are here with me will say give me the word give me all of the word I don't want some program I don't want some intellectual system I want the power of the Living God to tell me when I'm wrong to pick me up when I'm down to encourage me when I'm discouraged I want all of the word of God I don't satisfy a Saint's taste he'll take the word every time you see you can't mix it with your idea if you mix it with your idea you'll abort its effects amen I said if you mix the message with your own idea it will abort the effects of the message you say what is the effect of the message to change you to reconstruct everything that you think to to to annihilate all of your old Concepts and ideas and to give you the mind of Christ what's the effects of the message to change your body to change your spirit to change every part of you but if you mix it with our ideas if we mix it and hybrate it we abort its effect on our life you can't mix leaven with the unleaving the world Jesus said what Fellowship does was does God have with Mammon or does the s or or to B they don't they don't mix there's no mixing you can't mix the bride you can't mix the bride's word and the denominational word it won't mix you can try to organize it it won't organize you can become a one man denomination a oneman organization when you camp around your idea but listen you can't mix it with the word it won't mix oh can I just preach by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit you can't mix your psychology with it you can't mix your education with it you can't Mi mix your emotion with it you can't mix your doubt with it you can't mix your fear with it it won't mix you say then what do we got to do we got to welcome the pure unadulterated word of God just say give me all of the word the unadulterated word of God give me the pure word of God I want to just encourage you here as we close because this is really my my thought that the Lord really has burdened me with and it's it's just so over the last my goodness 9 10 days it's even been confusing to me I come back to something so simple something so simple I I just want to share because I'd be disobedient to the Lord not to share it with you something so simple the Lord just just continually night and day put in upon my heart and I want to say it to this whole church and I want to really the young people to tune in it is the devil's tactic to push us into ditches to make us extreme on one thing and not so extreme on the other and as we said and we took a minute just to say that we've seen some cut out emotion others say we don't need teaching some cut out dancing in the spirit to say we don't need to dance in the spirit then others cut out and say we don't need brotherly love we just need the bare-fisted gospel I believe in all of those things we don't need to love each other some say we don't need the tapes anymore we don't need to quote the the prophet anymore others say all we need is the prophet we don't need preachers all we need don't you realize What's Happening Here we we don't we don't need the message we just need the Bible just give me the Bible I don't need the message just give me the Bible and then others say I don't need the Bible just give me the message it's one side of the other am it's always the devil's tactic to push into ditches some cut out repentance and say you don't need the The Cutting word of God anymore others believe in The Cutting word of God but they don't believe in grace it's always the tactic of the devil to push us into ditches but brother random says but the true bride will draw from both ditches and walk down the middle of the road you say brother Matt what are we to be we're to be the first church you say the first church that's exactly right as brother Henry green would say God started his church how he wanted it now he wants it as he started it we're to be restored back to what a book of Acts again an Apostolic Faith with Apostolic power and Apostolic signs and Apostolic life and what part of the apostolic life all of it hallah every bit of it not just one part of it then what did the first church have let me tell you what the first church had the first church had the knowledge of the word of God because they read the word of God Amen the Bible says they continued steadfastly in the apostles Doctrine reading the word of God studying the word of God they had the revelation of the word they taught it and they preached it and more importantly than teaching it and preaching it the gospel needs to be lived they didn't just teach it and preach it on Sundays and Wednesdays they lived the gospel I say we don't just need to teach the message and preach the message we need a church that says let me live the message let me live it in my life let it take on skin let me live it out in my daily life they lived it the first church had the power and Dem demonstration of the Holy Spirit they had the manifestations of all of the gifts of the Spirit not just Paul not just Peter not just Barnabas not just the APO listen it wasn't just a few men it was the whole body they had the entire body was operating the gifts the Ley in the church had the demonstration of the Holy Ghost they weren't just absorbers brother Matt they didn't just sit there and listen no they weren't listeners they were doers we've got enough listeners we need some doers doers of the word of God they had the divine nature of Jesus and dwelling their bodies on a daily basis they were not just strong fisted iron hearted non-compromising non jellyfish they were also kindly affectionate in love and Grace one with another you can be hard fisted and bear and solid in your stand for the word of God you don't have to be a jellyfish to love somebody you can be strong and bold on the word of God and have love and grace for others in fact if you really love someone you will tell them the truth as brother bham says they get mad at me for preaching on women and how women dresses and cutting their hair and wearing pants and putting on makeup he says they you're just a woman hater brother BR says no I'm not I'm just trying to keep you out of Torment in hell that's real love Real Love is when you know the condition of someone will lead them to hell and so you have enough love for their soul whether it's your child your mother your father your brother your boss or your coworker you love their soul not their feelings you love their soul enough to say brother I'm going to tell you the truth in love they were kindly affectionate one for another this is what the word not emotion not a gift not Charisma not a organization not a movement not a cult not a click not a Brotherhood it's not what the message is it's the word made flesh and when the word's made flesh it operates I'm going to make a very important distinction you say brother Matt do you mean that you've preached on shouting and jumping and dancing and speaking in tongues or you mean that every believer should shout and jum dance no you don't have to ever shout you don't ever have to jump you don't ever have to speak in tongues in fact you don't have to do any of that but let me make a very important clear distinction if the Holy Ghost wants to do that you better not restrict him from doing it because often times the reason people don't speak in tongues is because of the pride human pride of what others will think and you are just as much subverting the word of God as a person who says I don't even believe in tongues most people never dance in the spirit because they're ashamed of what might others might think of them and change their social status most people let me just tell you anytime you ever dance in the spirit or speak in tongues it's because of one thing you bypassed the veil of Pride you've went beyond the pride the the the veil of what others might think and you get to the point and say I don't care what they might think I don't don't care what they might say I'm going to react because the Holy Ghost is in my body most of the time people never do is because they don't you say what is that brother mat that's not accepting the word in its fullness cuz when you accept the word in its fullness and you don't hold him at the door you say you're Lord of all Lord and you do anything you want with this Tabernacle you say whatever you want to say with this Temple amen they were they they had the word they were kindly affectionate one to another with brotherly love the ministry had Brotherly Love they spoke the truth Amen in love amen they spoke it in love not as a bully not as a bully the bullies have no place in the pull pit bullies have no place in a in a Believer they didn't speak it harshly just to tear somebody down but they spoke the truth with love does that mean they danced around their feelings no but they spoke the truth the first church had the gifts of the Spirit they had the gifts of the Spirit Faith they had the work in of Miracles they had wisdom what are the gifts of the Spirit they had Faith wisdom knowledge they spoke in tongues they interpreted in tongues they interpreted tongues they had the gifts of healing they had the working of Miracles they had the gifts of Prophecy they had the Discerning of the spirit why did they have that because the word is what they crowned the word is what they put on the throne and when the word is on the throne all of his gifts are available to the rest of the Kingdom oh I'm so glad they had the gifts I want the gifts let me tell you what else they had they had the fruits and you can't have the gifts if you don't have the fruits in fact the most perfect gift is the fruit of love love not worldly love real love Jesus love they have the fruits of the spirit you say what are those love joy peace longsuffering meekness Temperance godliness Faith they had the gifts they had the fruits they had the preaching they had the teaching they had varities and varieties and diversities of people because not everybody's the same nor does God want us to all be the same and God help us if we've got to the place to where we've tried to make all of our churches the same and make all of our preachers and think we all need to be at one church under one Ministry listen there's only one worldwide Ministry and it was William branham's Ministry it's not the ministry of a brother of a of a of a of a of a mega message church or a small little storefront God needs them all God needs all of the body to work in Harmony and I say God let me be in my position let me find my place in the body let me accept the word in its fullness with its gifts and it's fruits oh do I have a church that'll say God make me what you made me to be let me surrender my vessel to accept the word to welcome him in every door of my heart not to Camp down on one side or the other side and if there's ever a scarecrow that's been given listen we do not battle I'm just going to be straight up and be honest with you we do not battle a spirit of deifying brother brandom in this church right say we exempt from that Spirit no we're not exempt you're not exempt from any Spirit any Spirit can come in here but let me just say every church has its own battles they have their own Wars brother Brandon would even say Nations have have spirits and every nation has to battle a different Spirit America is a hahhaa hahaa laughter joking everything's a joke and he said that was the American Spirit that's what you've got to fight but I don't fight the spirit on Finland I don't fite the fight the spirit that a a brother a believer in Germany he has a spirit he's got to fight fight and I'll go further and say every church has a spirit that they've got to fight and War and contend against I'll go further and say every family has a strain in their family they've got to fight and War and contend and always keep in check and I'm not going to fight your battle so don't try to fight mine and I'm not going to tell you how to fight yours you don't tell me how to fight mine I say everybody needs to be fighting their own battle they're on post of Duty and not looking to the left or to the right as a group this is an individual Affair we've lost our identity as Believers we're not careful we mix up our identity that we're a big group we are a group we are a church God does have local bodies but God's not dealing with bethl Tabernacle as a group he's dealing with us as individuals I tell you who I've seen at the men's prayer meeting on Thursday nights as brothers who are in individually concerned with their own desperation of their own family or they're individually concerned with the burdens of their own hearts and own needs that's why they come to a Thursday night men's prayer meeting cuz they're desperate for something they want more of the power of God they want more dedication they want more consecration I believe that should be the Cry of every man in this church to say God give us a church that that's on fire with the fire of God I know we're not a group but I'd like to have a group with me I'd like to have Believers uh with me that are on the same page are fighting the same battle that have the same desire to say Lord we want to see you in our midst we want to see you in our music we want to see you in our young people oh can I get somebody who would agree with the preaching today and say I want to see the Lord all of the Lord in my body in the music in the young people in the pullit in the church in the ly I want to see God having full operation and full Sway and if the devil could do anything we do not battle a spirit of deine the tapes or push play that's just not our battle I would go darce to say that that wouldn't be the Battle of any I could be wrong that wouldn't be the struggle with anybody if I'd preach on a spirit trying to deify our spirit trying to get us to shut up preachers and push play in the pull pit you can preach that all day long come to our church and preach it to red in the face and preach it for an hour and you'll get amens but I guarantee you you're not going to find many with that spirit inside of them you say brother matth then what is the spirit I guarantee you we got one that may not be our battle if anything our battle is to deemphasize the tape if anything if the devil can do anything to our churches and our young people is to deemphasize the voice of God's prophet and I'm going to come down a little bit closer because I feel the holy H Spirit right now want to say something if anything we battle at bethl Tabernacle at our church in our youth and our young people in my own life and our lives if anything if the devil's not going to get us brother Brandon said if he can't make you uh uh go follow he says fall on the cliff on this side he'll push you to the other side and just kick you over the edge on the opposite and if anything we've done is we've deemphasized listen to me and my brother my sister I want to make my burden so C clear to you this morning because it's so personal to me if you are not listening to the tape voice if you are not feeding on the tape voice you will have no faith for a body change or a Rapture you say well my daddy and my mama don't that don't matter you're an individual and God will not judge you based upon your mom and your dad God will judge you based upon you and it doesn't matter what others are doing around you if you are not hearing the voice of indication and that's not brother Matt and that's not brother Jason that's not any brother there's one voice of vindication and if you're not feeding on the word of the hour I am I am fully persuaded more than ever before if our people would hear the voice of God's Prophet more on a daily basis we'd have 90% of the spirit and problems destroyed in the church today if our churches were hearing stop fighting War Wars that don't belong to you stop fighting battles that have nothing to do with you if you would hear the voice of vindication and stop questioning everything we'd have 90% of our battles and our families and our homes and our young people would be gone now that's just for here those on the live stream if you don't like that I apologize I'm just preaching to our church right here if anything more than ever before we need to be hearing the voice that God sent in this generation there's only one voice that can turn your heart back and it's not enough to hear Brother Matt put it on Powerpoints and slides it's not enough listen friends you can treat the word so many different ways some people treat the word of God like a horoscope and they get their daily dose that's okay I'm not saying you can't do that but some people open up the Bible I'm just going to be practical can I be PR practical and we'll close don't get scared I'm closing some people treat the word of God that way and they treat their I'm not I'm not even saying that you can't do that but some people they this is how they treat the word it's it's all in how you approach the word everybody has a different approach to the word you approach the message differently and you approach the Bible differently some people look for one sentence just one word they open their Bible and just give me give me a word for the day it's like a horoscope hope and I'm not saying there's not value in that a lot of times I'll Do Lord I'm going through a situation just give me one little son God will give me one little verse but listen friends if you really want to get to know him you've got to find more than just a quote or more than just a verse the word is so much more than just a daily horoscope it's more than just your daily dose of the word you've got something to live listen it's good to have things to live by that's that's how that's how many people you read the Bible and you want good sound advice that's good but let me just say there's a person in this Bible there's a person on those tapes who is speaking there's a voice that's speaking to your soul and it's more than just a daily dose or a word of advice people treat it like medically the medicinal approach just a little bit you know one ver a day keeps the devil away just one quote a day keeps the devil away and if I just hear that one quote I just got it playing while I'm sleeping and though I don't hear listen that's wonderful there there's value I'm not I'm not disparaging any of that there's value there's Great Value in just hearing the words hearing the prophet's voice reading your Bible and just to read it just devotional devotional reading is good not discouraging that but friends he's more than a devotion he's more than a devotion he's more than your favorite uh uh uh meme he's more than you you have you Facebook and Instagram and I'll put up a quote or put up a picture put up a little oneliner and it's wonderful and I love him but let me just say he wants to come in your heart he wants to fill up every void he wants to open every door and I just say God I want you to come in every room in my heart come in I give you the key to this to my body I give you the key to my pride oh could you stand to your feet and raise your hand hand and say God I welcome you this morning you've knocked on my door and I want to raise a hand and say Lord I invite you come and make yourself at home open up the refrigerator sit down lord I want to make you a guest in my home Lord I want to invite you I don't just want to accept Jesus as a thought I don't just want to accept him as an idea every head bowed every eye closed hands raised Lord I want to invite you in and I want to give you the key to every door I'm giving you permission Lord to go in the most secret places of my heart I'm giving you permission Lord to look around uncover pick up look at every closet look at every crack look at everywhere Lord I want I want the light of the Gospel to look at my entire life I want to be one who welcomes the word who says give me the word that's what I'm longing for not just a part of it not just a portion of it I want every piece of it Lord I don't just want to read my Bible or hear a tape hear the messenger's voice I don't just I don't just want a sample I don't just want a taste I don't don't just want my daily dose well listen friends it's good to study your B it's good even me preaching sermons I don't just I got to be you know you want to be careful you don't just study the word just to study it for a thought or study it for a some something you can preach it's wonderful I don't disparage that but you've got to say Lord I'm not studying the word to get to some education or academic understanding but I want to know the person of the word personally to me what is the Holy Ghost evidence of the Holy Ghost it's the revelation of Jesus Christ to you personally and I invite any young person old person I don't care how old how young to raise your hand and say Lord I want a revelation of you personally in my life oh God that's the Revelation that the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against it but we will prevail against them I want to know him personally I'll raise my hand and I just want to do it today Lord apart from anybody that's looking apart from anybody that's watching I raise my hands up before you Lord and I said give me the [Music] word give me the word it's the only thing that sets free it's the only thing that breaks chains is the word so give me the word Lord I don't want to mix it with my idea I don't want to mix it with my my concept of God I want to see you in the real image and reflection of who you really are not diluted and not polluted by man but I want to know you want to know you Lord that's my prayer it's my prayer for every individual with hands raised every mother every father young and old let us hear that voice of vindication Lord I want to hunger Lord not to not to hear the voice of a proph of a Kentucky man from Kentucky that's I love God's Prophet Lord but I want to hear the voice behind the voice because behind the voice of that seventh messenger is the son of man behind that voice is the son of man and he's still speaking today he's still setting free he's still delivering he's still bringing power he's still filling with the baptism of the Holy Ghost yes Lord yes Lord Jesus oh you just want to make him feel welcome this morning could we just raise our hands and say Lord I welcome you I welcome
