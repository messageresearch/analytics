[0:00] proceeding, but we'll pray first.
[0:02] Father, we come before you, Lord, and we
[0:07] just want to lift our hearts up to you,
[0:10] Lord. Living in
[0:13] living in a such a a dark hour in so
[0:18] many ways. And Lord, where would we be
[0:20] without the prophetic voice you've given
[0:23] to us at this day? Lord, we'd be so
[0:27] confused and
[0:29] lost in the chaos, Lord. But you you
[0:32] sent us a voice,
[0:34] Lord, to make everything clear for us.
[0:38] Keep our focus
[0:39] &gt;&gt; and our understanding of the times
[0:41] correct, Lord, in in such an incredible
[0:45] way, Lord, in a way that none of us
[0:48] could really comprehend or imagine,
[0:51] Lord. And so we we just want to lift our
[0:54] hearts to you. Ask that you would be be
[0:57] with us this morning and we commit
[0:59] ourselves and our time to you in Jesus
[1:01] name. Amen. Very
[1:06] I haven't been able to I tried my best
[1:08] to study. I haven't been able to even
[1:10] come up with uh any particular thought
[1:14] uh that I wanted to look into. And the
[1:21] maybe for some of you, you you've
[1:24] never heard of Charlie Kirk before. And
[1:27] uh that's just been heavy on my heart.
[1:30] &gt;&gt; Ever since that happened. And you know
[1:33] looking at that I certainly don't want
[1:34] to steal anything away from brother
[1:36] Jason but at the same time I couldn't if
[1:39] the Holy Spirit is dealing with you I
[1:41] just how you can't I every I have a
[1:44] thousand notes to pull up that I could
[1:45] do for Sunday school but it's like
[1:48] totally blank and few scriptures have
[1:53] come to my mind. Philippians 1 verse 20.
[1:57] I don't know that we have anybody back
[1:59] there, but
[2:01] we'll go ahead and pull that up.
[2:09] Philippians 1:20 and 21.
[2:14] according to my earnest expectation and
[2:17] my hope that in nothing I shall be
[2:19] ashamed but that with all boldness as
[2:23] always so now also Christ shall be
[2:25] magnified in my body whether it be by
[2:28] life or by death for me to live is
[2:32] Christ and to die is gain
[2:36] &gt;&gt; amen God God has given us such a a a
[2:40] word of of comfort and strength you I I
[2:45] look at all of this and and I again I
[2:47] apologize if people don't know who he
[2:48] is. You probably do by now if if you
[2:51] don't. It's such a horrible evil that is
[2:57] going on in the world today.
[2:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:59] &gt;&gt; And you look at this, you know, we we
[3:01] understand the teaching of the wise and
[3:04] foolish virgin and and and we get that
[3:06] and we understand that we know that God
[3:08] God works and has an eternal purpose
[3:10] both for the wise and the foolish
[3:12] virgin. And so we don't uh denigrate
[3:16] that whatsoever and understanding uh uh
[3:20] properly placing these things according
[3:22] to the scripture. I don't want to take
[3:23] the time to do that. I just want to put
[3:25] that in your mind. Don't think that
[3:27] Jason's wigged out on everybody here.
[3:29] So, um, but, uh, Charlie Kirk with
[3:35] boldness proclaimed the name of Christ
[3:38] and stood for biblical, uh, values,
[3:42] biblical worldview, and he knew that the
[3:45] price could be his life. He spoke of
[3:47] that over and over again. And yet, he
[3:49] did continue to put himself in harm's
[3:52] way. And I mean speak directly to a
[3:54] culture that is so given over to the
[3:58] enemy, to the devil, that they're
[4:00] celebrating his gruesome assassination.
[4:05] And as I look at all of these things, I
[4:08] just say for myself,
[4:11] Lord, let me speak with all boldness.
[4:14] I'm I'm I'll I'll never have a platform
[4:16] like Charlie Kirk,
[4:18] &gt;&gt; but I have I have a platform, which
[4:21] every one of us do. I have a family. I
[4:25] have I have a wife. I have I have
[4:26] daughters. I have people that I
[4:28] fellowship with. And I believe that this
[4:31] is just a a reminder reminder, at least
[4:34] for me, to never compromise, never to
[4:38] feel like, oh, I'm scared to say
[4:39] something because I might get fired. I
[4:40] might get this. I mean, here's a man
[4:43] who's not even has a doesn't even have a
[4:46] revelation of the message of the word
[4:49] for this day. And he's standing boldly
[4:52] in front of people that hated hated and
[4:54] despised him and debating with them and
[4:57] speaking absolutely plainly about the
[5:00] importance of marriage, of family, of
[5:03] homeschooling, of uh such incredible
[5:08] things that he would stand for. And
[5:10] Lord, let me be in such a place that I
[5:13] with all boldness
[5:16] uh that Christ would be magnified in my
[5:18] body, whether it be in life or whether
[5:20] it be in death. And we have to we have
[5:23] to live and think like that as
[5:25] Christians. We don't have a promise of
[5:30] any more time. We don't know we don't
[5:33] know when our time will be called up. We
[5:35] need to realize, you know, we have loved
[5:37] ones we need to speak to plainly,
[5:39] boldly, but with love and compassion in
[5:43] our hearts. You know, I I I think it's
[5:46] so incredible because you hear the
[5:47] different things that people said about
[5:50] about him or he he said, "Do you hate
[5:53] transgender people?" He's like, "How
[5:55] could I hate people that I have such a
[5:57] heart for?"
[5:59] And I hate he hates what's evil. And
[6:03] that's how we need to be. We need to be
[6:04] in that position where we absolutely
[6:07] hate what is evil. We cling to that
[6:10] which is good.
[6:12] Not hate who is evil but hate that which
[6:14] is evil.
[6:17] And
[6:19] we look at this as well in you know in
[6:25] in just in as individuals as we
[6:27] experience this and I think maybe the
[6:30] young young younger people younger
[6:32] generation this might even impact them
[6:35] more greatly because as Christians
[6:37] you're you're trying to shape and form
[6:39] your your worldview as a believer and
[6:42] Charlie Kirk would be a great help to
[6:44] you And I would encourage young people
[6:48] uh to take the time to watch his videos
[6:50] because many of the things he says says
[6:53] lines up exactly with what we believe in
[6:56] the message
[6:59] as far as family and home and etc. I'm
[7:01] not giving a blank statement. You got to
[7:04] use discernment and search everything by
[7:05] what the prophet said. But in general,
[7:08] you know, brother Matt and I have talked
[7:10] about that as well. And
[7:13] it's it's just incredible to see
[7:17] even so that the the reactions from both
[7:20] sides of the political spectrum and sort
[7:23] of moving into an aspect of uh the
[7:26] prophetic
[7:28] in this day. There's a real we
[7:32] understand what is coming,
[7:34] &gt;&gt; right? Is it communism that's going to
[7:37] rule the world? No. And this is what I
[7:40] that this is what I see as so important
[7:42] to remember the message and to remember
[7:45] how this fits into
[7:48] uh
[7:49] prophecy because it isn't a left-wing uh
[7:53] prophecy that brother Brandham brings
[7:55] forward and prevents presents before us
[7:58] that atheists communists are going to
[8:01] take over the world and we would in our
[8:05] minds and that's what many people
[8:06] thought brother Brandham was preaching
[8:08] against if you start to search
[8:09] communism, do that. I encourage you go
[8:12] into the table and search communism,
[8:15] Romanism, communism, Catholic,
[8:18] &gt;&gt; and you'll see what brother Brandham
[8:19] says. This is very important to
[8:21] understand that because there's there is
[8:24] a deception coming that will deceive
[8:26] even message believers
[8:28] &gt;&gt; and they will see a political move
[8:30] happen in this world and they'll say,
[8:31] "This is good. This is fantastic." and
[8:34] we'll say, "Yeah,
[8:36] yeah, it it is." But
[8:41] one word off is death,
[8:43] &gt;&gt; right? And so, Brother Brandham says in
[8:46] the mark of the beast, 1954, "This
[8:48] United States will come to a time that
[8:51] church and state will unite together and
[8:53] Protestant and Catholic will throw their
[8:55] things together to fight communism."
[8:59] and ex exactly playing into the hands of
[9:02] what God said right here. And behold, a
[9:06] greater Solomon is here in 1962. Let me
[9:09] drop this in. I hope my watch don't
[9:11] alarm too quick. But look, listen. The
[9:13] people today are scared to death of
[9:15] communism. Shame on you. Well, what are
[9:18] you scared of communism? I want a
[9:20] theologian, any Bible scholar, to show
[9:22] me where communism will rule the world.
[9:25] I tell you Romanism is going to rule the
[9:29] world according to the Bible.
[9:32] &gt;&gt; So this is so important to understand
[9:35] that we we look at what's happening and
[9:38] if you can if you understand what's
[9:40] happening to the younger generation is
[9:42] there is a huge pendulum swing that's
[9:46] going on. I know that there's many are
[9:48] deceived by the communist things that
[9:52] are going on in college. And
[9:55] I don't want to get into this, but I
[9:57] would just give a great warning. This
[9:59] this young this young man who became an
[10:02] assassin grew up in a Christian home and
[10:04] a Christian family. And what did he do?
[10:07] He got a scholarship to a to a liberal
[10:09] university with what? With within one
[10:12] year he was on Reddit, obsessed with
[10:15] Reddit and he was a liberal and he was
[10:17] losing his mind. This is a short period
[10:19] of time that he was deceived
[10:23] uh from a university. So I give a great
[10:25] warning and unless you have a a perfect
[10:28] leadership from the Lord to do it for a
[10:30] perfect reason.
[10:32] &gt;&gt; My goodness, Christians should think
[10:34] twice, three times, 10 times, 20 times
[10:37] before they ever enter their children
[10:39] into a university. It's a it's a grave
[10:42] grave danger and it's not something to
[10:44] take lightly.
[10:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:46] &gt;&gt; Where was I? Where
[10:49] this when you don't have notes, there's
[10:51] a danger of rabbit trails.
[10:55] going everywhere and then then you get
[10:58] lost.
[11:00] But as as you look at this this
[11:02] communism that's ra I understand that
[11:03] that is a that is something that's
[11:05] happening but it's really not what is
[11:09] the major thing that's happening uh in
[11:13] in western uh the western world
[11:16] regarding worldview and that is that uh
[11:20] gen Z and Gen A in particular are moving
[11:23] very sharply right.
[11:25] uh many of them would even consider
[11:28] Donald Trump to be left-wing
[11:31] would would consider him to not be very
[11:33] conservative or not conservative enough
[11:36] for their tastes. And so as we
[11:38] understand this, we I was speaking with
[11:40] the brothers last weekend in the
[11:42] fellowship hall about this and to see
[11:44] this happen, it was already happening.
[11:47] But do you understand this event the
[11:49] Lord I mean the Lord has a sovereign
[11:52] purpose that he allows in everything.
[11:53] The word is going to come to pass. This
[11:55] is like a throwing gasoline on a fire
[11:59] that was already burning.
[12:01] &gt;&gt; And I think you'll see in the the coming
[12:03] weeks, months, and next few years this
[12:07] this
[12:08] shift hard right towards Catholicism and
[12:12] and mainline traditional Protestantism.
[12:16] This will increase
[12:18] 100,000 m even just this event. You see
[12:23] things pour absolutely pouring in and
[12:25] people saying, "I'm going to church now.
[12:27] I've been on the fence. I'm going to
[12:28] church. I bought a Bible. I'm doing
[12:30] this. I'm doing that. It It is causing a
[12:34] huge firestorm." And who could argue
[12:36] that's it? Oh, that's horrible.
[12:38] Goodness.
[12:40] No, obviously not. None of us as
[12:43] believers should stand up and say it's
[12:45] horrible, but we should issue a warning
[12:47] and say there's a direction. It's the
[12:50] great that rides upon the beast.
[12:52] And the great is not red China or
[12:56] communism. It's not red, it's purple.
[13:00] &gt;&gt; It's scarlet
[13:02] and purple.
[13:04] Two two colors together. And so it's
[13:07] that's who ride who rides the beast.
[13:09] That's who's pulling uh
[13:13] pulling the levers behind the scenes
[13:17] with everything.
[13:21] And if you if you could see that and
[13:23] understand it's the it's the Roman
[13:24] Catholic Church behind the scenes
[13:27] controlling the beast order. And you
[13:30] know we all of these things are always
[13:34] here in part but then will come in
[13:37] fullness as time goes on. We have them.
[13:39] We all have all these things here. We
[13:41] have spiritually speaking the mark of
[13:43] the beast is already in place. Amen.
[13:45] &gt;&gt; We have all these things, but then it
[13:47] will come to a place where it will
[13:49] actually be a boycott. Thank God we'll
[13:51] the bride will be raptured and gone
[13:54] &gt;&gt; after that. But with all that said, if
[13:57] we can understand and and and and grasp
[14:00] the importance and the significance of
[14:03] the current events, you know, 20 years
[14:05] ago, every everybody thought, well,
[14:08] maybe uh the liberals are the ones that
[14:10] are going to bring in the
[14:13] mark of the beast and we got Clinton and
[14:15] we got Obama and we got all this anti-
[14:18] absolutely is antichrist, but it's at
[14:21] its core it's communist and it's not
[14:23] what we're supposed to fear in in many
[14:25] ways if we can if we can put it all
[14:28] together that communism was just the
[14:30] scarecrow to cause everybody to respond.
[14:34] &gt;&gt; And when I say communism, I mean the
[14:36] left.
[14:37] &gt;&gt; The left is headlong into communism. And
[14:42] their purpose and their plan is is is
[14:48] they want to they want to bring forth
[14:49] communism. They they're sincere about
[14:51] that. But the devil is just laughing at
[14:54] everyone
[14:55] &gt;&gt; because it's he simply is eliciting a
[14:58] natural response.
[15:01] &gt;&gt; You know, for young people, they they
[15:04] want they want to be they want to be on
[15:06] the edge. They they want to be moving
[15:09] towards something. How can you be on the
[15:11] edge and moving towards something with
[15:13] modern society like this today? Means go
[15:15] back to traditional values. It means
[15:18] become a Catholic. go into and and look,
[15:21] you look at all of this. The world has
[15:24] gotten so dark and so evil that we as
[15:26] message believers see Catholics and say,
[15:28] "Oh,
[15:30] I'd rather have them be that than
[15:32] anything else." Okay. Well,
[15:36] yes. No.
[15:39] &gt;&gt; No. Because that doesn't that's death.
[15:42] &gt;&gt; We get to the core reality. Just because
[15:44] you share some basic values, how can two
[15:48] walk together lest they be agreed? I
[15:51] think the value of brother Brandham's
[15:53] message is becoming clearer and clearer
[15:55] and clearer to Bible believers
[15:59] because he's preaching this over and
[16:00] over again and you're going, "What in
[16:01] the world?" I mean, we got we got other
[16:04] problems, Brother Brandham. We got Bill
[16:05] Clinton and Obama and all this stuff
[16:08] going on and it's it's we're missing.
[16:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And Christians are are being
[16:16] deceived by it and pulled aside. And
[16:18] again, as I said, I don't say I don't
[16:21] say it's a bad thing that people are
[16:23] buying their Bibles. And I believe even
[16:25] many of them will become part of that
[16:27] remnant, part of that foolish virgin.
[16:30] No, no doubt about that. And they'll
[16:32] decide at the at the last second, I
[16:34] can't take this thing. I can't take
[16:36] They'll be hunted down by like dogs.
[16:40] And yet as we look at the whole picture,
[16:43] we have to understand that there is that
[16:46] out of this is a great deception.
[16:48] &gt;&gt; And I think we learned
[16:53] we learned not to trust our news media.
[16:56] If you didn't know that before when CO
[16:59] struck and you still don't know it, I
[17:01] don't know if you ever will.
[17:04] uh but co was something that revealed
[17:07] many secrets
[17:09] &gt;&gt; and brought to light many many lies uh
[17:12] from that are going forth all around the
[17:16] world. And so when we look at what's
[17:18] what's happening understand is we're not
[17:22] being told the whole story. Uh this is a
[17:25] this is as much as we like to say I like
[17:28] what Trump is doing. I like what this is
[17:32] doing. We have we have to step back and
[17:34] see it from the realm of prophetic.
[17:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:38] &gt;&gt; I don't I don't begrudge any of any of
[17:41] those things and and the the the uh the
[17:45] the things that have been done to move
[17:47] against perversion and wickedness.
[17:51] That's that's wonderful. I think I think
[17:54] what's been done to move away from
[17:55] perversion and wickedness is good. Only
[17:58] the problem is is what's the motive and
[18:00] objective behind it? what's the heart
[18:02] behind it? And I think the same thing
[18:04] for us as we look at just kind of want
[18:06] to transition away from those thoughts.
[18:09] Um, as we look at this and we see what
[18:12] what happened with Charlie Kirk and I
[18:16] think everybody feels like I got to do
[18:18] something. I got to stand up. I got to
[18:20] get active politically. I got to I've
[18:24] got to do something. And I think if if
[18:27] we really look at it in any
[18:29] circumstance, in any situation, whatever
[18:31] happens,
[18:33] the thing is for us to really come down
[18:36] to this and that we want to live
[18:38] according to the word.
[18:39] &gt;&gt; If there's anything in your life that's
[18:42] not right with the Lord, now is the time
[18:44] to realize you could
[18:46] you could you you might not make it out
[18:48] of this church.
[18:50] &gt;&gt; We you know, anything can happen in this
[18:52] evil society. We don't like to think
[18:54] like that but the reality is let's get
[18:58] rid of the evil things in our lives and
[19:01] ultimately this what comes down to when
[19:03] things happen in the world God is giving
[19:05] us a message
[19:07] and you know even when a prophet would
[19:09] come and condemn a n whole nation God
[19:13] even then God wasn't saying it's
[19:14] hopeless he's informing them hey
[19:19] things are bad you have to repent you
[19:22] have to turn away from evil. And if you
[19:24] know any of us want to feel like, hey, I
[19:26] want to do something. How about you love
[19:28] your family? Well,
[19:30] &gt;&gt; how about you love your spouse
[19:34] a little deeper?
[19:36] &gt;&gt; And how about you dig in a little deeper
[19:38] and teach your family the word of God?
[19:41] You say, "I haven't built that habit. We
[19:43] haven't done it. It'll be weird." Good.
[19:45] Be weird.
[19:50] &gt;&gt; Lead your family. Love your family well.
[19:53] Love the people around you well. When
[19:56] and and that means many times having to
[19:58] say the unpopular thing, the difficult
[20:00] thing. That coworker who's struggling,
[20:03] have the difficult conversation with
[20:04] them. The coworker that hates you, is
[20:08] giving you a hard time, have the
[20:10] difficult conversation and speak the
[20:12] truth to them with love, with compassion
[20:14] in your heart. And if you're just angry,
[20:19] we all are a little angry
[20:22] about what what has happened. And we're
[20:26] all maybe hurting over what's happened.
[20:30] I am. Understand that the Lord's trying
[20:33] to speak some a message to you through
[20:36] through the anger and through the hurt.
[20:38] And it could be a thousand different
[20:41] messages. But I would I would say beyond
[20:44] anything, live the word.
[20:46] &gt;&gt; Live the word. Speak the word with
[20:48] boldness. As we read before, Paul saying
[20:52] his earnest expectation and his hope
[20:55] that in nothing he would be he would
[20:57] live his life in such a way that in
[20:59] nothing he would be ashamed,
[21:02] &gt;&gt; but that he could have with a clear
[21:03] conscience.
[21:05] He could speak with all all boldness
[21:09] as always. And now also that Christ
[21:13] would be magnified in my body.
[21:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:18] &gt;&gt; Whatever come, whatever might come. I
[21:21] think if you can understand it, the
[21:25] gospel is not come and your life will be
[21:29] better. The gospel is surrender yourself
[21:32] to Christ.
[21:34] &gt;&gt; In one sense, it's true. I came to give
[21:37] you life at that more abundantly. And
[21:39] when you live according to God's
[21:41] principles, that means you can have
[21:42] peace in your heart and you can live and
[21:44] speak with boldness.
[21:46] On the other hand is we have to count
[21:48] the cost of being a disciple of Jesus
[21:51] Christ. If you remember the the
[21:54] different parables that the Lord tells
[21:55] about a king if he comes to attack a
[21:57] city, he would be a fool if he didn't
[22:00] sit down and understand, do I have
[22:02] enough troops? Do I have the capability
[22:04] to do it? No. This guy has way more
[22:06] troops. All right, I'm going to send an
[22:08] emissary to make peace with this person.
[22:11] And he says,
[22:13] you we need to realize and sit down and
[22:16] count the costs of being a disciple of
[22:18] Jesus Christ. It will cost us
[22:21] everything. We must give everything up
[22:25] to him and let him live and operate in
[22:28] our bodies.
[22:31] Amen. And we want him to be I mean how
[22:34] many want Christ to be magnified in your
[22:37] body?
[22:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want I want him to be magnified
[22:42] in my body. But then the next part is
[22:44] hey I want to be magnified in my body
[22:46] whether it be in life or whether it's
[22:48] how I die.
[22:49] &gt;&gt; I want the way I die and the way I live
[22:53] both to magnify
[22:55] Christ. Amen.
[22:59] Romans 12
[23:01] 1
[23:04] I beseech you therefore brethren by the
[23:06] mercies of God that you present your
[23:07] bodies a living sacrifice holy
[23:09] acceptable unto God which is your
[23:11] reasonable service and be not conformed
[23:15] to this world. Amen. So we have to stand
[23:19] against the ways of the world. We have
[23:22] to stand in contradistinction
[23:24] to the ways of the world. He's called us
[23:27] at the very core, we're different. Even
[23:30] a portion of the meaning of the word
[23:31] holiness, to be holy means to be
[23:34] different, means to be other, means to
[23:35] be separated.
[23:37] We're not to be like the world. We're
[23:39] not to try to find a way to be as close
[23:41] to the world as we possibly can.
[23:44] &gt;&gt; No, we're not to be conformed, but we're
[23:46] to be transformed
[23:48] by the renewing of your mind.
[23:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. So it starts in the mind. The
[23:54] renewing of your life and how you live
[23:57] and how you how you act starts with
[24:01] what's in your mind. What you're feeding
[24:03] your mind, what you're believing and
[24:06] what you're receiving into your mind.
[24:08] That is that is what will be the
[24:10] transforming place. Amen. And that's
[24:13] where the greatest battle ever fought
[24:14] is. that you may prove what is that good
[24:19] and acceptable and perfect will of God.
[24:22] For I say through the grace given unto
[24:25] me to every man that is among you, not
[24:27] to think of himself more highly than he
[24:29] ought to think, but to think soberly,
[24:31] according as God hath dealt to every man
[24:34] the measure of faith. For as we have
[24:36] many members in one body, and all
[24:39] members have not the same office, so we
[24:41] being many are one body in Christ, and
[24:44] everyone members one of another, having
[24:47] then gifts differing according to the
[24:49] grace that is given to us, whether
[24:51] prophecy, let us prophesy according to
[24:53] the proportion of faith. Or ministry,
[24:55] let us wait on our ministering. Or he
[24:57] that teacheth on teaching, or he that
[24:59] exhortth on exhortation. He that giveth,
[25:01] let him do it with simplicity. He that
[25:03] ruleth with diligence. He that showeth
[25:05] mercy with cheerfulness. Amen. We all
[25:08] have a different calling and in a
[25:10] different place
[25:11] &gt;&gt; and a different position in the body.
[25:14] But it all requires a full surrender to
[25:17] Christ.
[25:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:19] &gt;&gt; It's not saying the preachers have to
[25:20] have more of a surrender and the drum
[25:22] drum drummer has to have a less
[25:24] surrender. That's not each one of us has
[25:27] a ministry and a gift that we need to
[25:28] operate and we need to fully surrender
[25:31] our hearts and minds to the Lord so that
[25:33] we can operate with boldness. And then
[25:35] beyond that, not just in the body, but
[25:37] also in our own family. Each one of us
[25:39] has a different place and a pos
[25:41] different position. Some are older
[25:43] siblings, some are younger siblings,
[25:45] some are middle siblings. There's
[25:46] different position and place and there's
[25:48] a different interaction that will take
[25:50] place in there. But the Lord wants you
[25:52] to be all that you can be for the
[25:55] building up of the family. It's not just
[25:57] dad's place to build up the family or
[25:59] mom's place to build up for the family.
[26:02] It's also the children's place if they
[26:04] if if they understand it right. They
[26:06] have gifts. They've been made in such a
[26:09] way that they can bless and build up the
[26:11] family. And it's even our job as fathers
[26:14] to see that and bring that out of them.
[26:17] And so I think if we look at what's
[26:19] happened recently, I think it can be
[26:22] just a if you can for me personally, I
[26:24] feel like it's a call to to realize how
[26:28] important my duty as a Christian is. Not
[26:32] just as a preacher.
