[7:37] let's pray
[7:39] father we thank you very kindly for our
[7:42] wonderful beautiful morning that we have
[7:44] here
[7:45] beautiful outside inside and all around
[7:49] Lord and we have the beauty of thy
[7:51] presence here this morning
[7:54] and we are looking now father to go into
[7:57] your word and break down this lesson for
[8:00] our Sunday school class this morning
[8:01] we're praying for all of the various
[8:04] families Lord who are out traveling in
[8:06] Ministry team deployed around
[8:08] ministering be with us here now I pray
[8:12] in Jesus name amen God bless you friends
[8:15] we're going to invite you to Second
[8:18] Corinthians chapter five
[8:22] and we'll just catch
[8:25] um
[8:26] a couple of verses here and then I'll
[8:28] let you be seated and we'll carry on
[8:30] brother Matt and I have swapped today
[8:33] and I'll give a little bit of an update
[8:36] on my continuing battle with the devil
[8:39] amen the shingles outbreak that I had
[8:43] about four weeks ago
[8:45] as continues to fight against me
[8:48] and then a lot of other different
[8:50] complications have Arisen because of it
[8:53] mostly medication extended medication
[8:56] so I covet your prayers amen right Amen
[8:59] brother Donald I know I can count on
[9:00] your prayers for sure and so um just
[9:03] trusting the Lord for it I um I'm going
[9:06] to say it now and I'm going to say it
[9:08] again if I can think about it in all of
[9:10] this on all of this trial
[9:13] I have I have a brand new not brand new
[9:16] because I've had it before but I have a
[9:18] further appreciation for the fact that
[9:22] the devil ain't nobody
[9:24] amen and I see that now more than
[9:27] anything and I think that burns him
[9:29] because I don't I don't consider him I'm
[9:32] not afraid of him he's no threat to me
[9:34] amen amen so we are trusting in the Lord
[9:37] for his grace
[9:39] second Corinthians chapter 5 I want to
[9:42] take a lesson this morning
[9:44] persuading you to live higher persuading
[9:49] you to live higher
[9:52] Paul speaking in second Corinthians 5
[9:54] verses 10 11 for we must all appear
[9:59] before the Judgment seat of Christ that
[10:02] everyone may receive the things done in
[10:06] this body according to that he hath done
[10:09] whether it be good or bad verse 11
[10:12] knowing therefore the terror of the lord
[10:15] we persuade men but but we are made
[10:20] manifest unto God and I trust also our
[10:24] made manifest in your consciences amen
[10:28] may the Lord bless the reading of his
[10:30] word you can be seated
[10:34] thank you
[10:36] I want to catch another scripture here
[10:39] Paul's saying here in our in our opening
[10:41] text concerning how that he persuades
[10:44] men and you know that's that's the very
[10:48] title Paul's saying here that knowing
[10:51] therefore the terror of the lord we
[10:53] persuade Men Moving to Galatians the
[10:57] first chapter Paul again speaking verse
[11:00] 9 and 10. as we said before so say I now
[11:04] again if any man preach any other gospel
[11:09] unto you then that ye have received let
[11:13] him be accursed
[11:14] for do I now persuade men or God or do I
[11:19] seek to please men for if I yet pleased
[11:22] men I should not be the servant of
[11:26] Christ and so Paul is trying to make a
[11:31] couple of points here that I'm chaining
[11:32] together one is that he's not afraid to
[11:36] try to persuade men and when we talk
[11:40] about persuading persuasion I want to
[11:43] look at a number of things today but
[11:45] we're we're we're certainly going to be
[11:48] talking about far more than just
[11:50] psychology we're talking about more than
[11:53] just mental persuasion now there's a
[11:57] there's a necessity of that because even
[12:01] the right mental attitude towards the
[12:03] word of God brings it to pass and
[12:05] brother Branham has taught us that
[12:07] Revelation starts in the mind it starts
[12:10] here you have to come to an agreement by
[12:13] God's grace you can't do it on your own
[12:15] the human mind is enmity against God but
[12:18] God by his grace allows you to agree
[12:22] with his word and brother Brown said as
[12:23] soon as he can get you to agree with his
[12:25] word then that then that then that
[12:28] annihilates the old nature and a new
[12:30] birth occurs and then that that drops
[12:32] down into your heart from your head to
[12:34] your heart and it becomes a revelation
[12:37] which when we say the word revelation we
[12:40] mean a living Revelation a living
[12:42] reality I believe
[12:44] that it should change our lives there
[12:47] are many ways to persuade someone to
[12:51] live at a higher standard in their life
[12:54] I think about this a lot as a minister
[12:56] of the Gospel how can I persuade people
[12:59] how can I beg how can I plead how can I
[13:03] find a way to be a counter offensive a
[13:09] counter tactic to the enemy because I
[13:12] know the enemies in your ear
[13:14] I know for sure the enemies in your
[13:17] teenager's ear and so uh you know I I'm
[13:20] not afraid to engage him and get in your
[13:24] ear also because I have a supernatural
[13:27] weapon and you know there are a number
[13:30] of persuasive ways and there's a lot you
[13:33] know a lot of you know a lot of this
[13:36] stuff I you know they they tried to cram
[13:38] in me in marketing school and things
[13:40] like that but but you know uh
[13:43] I'm a gospel preacher you know and that
[13:45] stuff I'm like I'll just go right by
[13:47] bypass all that stuff because I want to
[13:49] cut to the word amen I I find that in
[13:52] the word of God there is the superpower
[13:55] there is a persuasion called economic
[13:58] persuasion where you know if you're
[14:01] trying to persuade someone you can let
[14:03] them know that hey you know you you need
[14:06] to take this deal because here's an
[14:08] economic persuasion this thing this deal
[14:10] is only going to last so long and you
[14:12] could miss out on a great opportunity to
[14:15] save some money or miss on an
[14:17] opportunity to make some money the whole
[14:19] world gets persuaded daily by economic
[14:23] Persuasions good and bad ones real and
[14:26] false ones there is the what they call
[14:30] the moral persuasion where you know you
[14:33] you let the the person know that that by
[14:36] by by by
[14:38] coming to
[14:40] um to improve themselves that they can
[14:43] make the world a better place they can
[14:45] make those around them uh have a better
[14:48] atmosphere I think the moral persuasion
[14:50] is a good one I think that you know I'm
[14:52] not I'm not worried about economic
[14:54] persuasion uh because that's just the
[14:57] tree of knowledge of Good and Evil and
[14:58] Satan's a god of economics and don't
[15:01] ever imagine he's going to let it go
[15:02] smooth for God's family but I'm glad we
[15:04] got promises but I love the moral
[15:07] persuasion to say to you that you know I
[15:10] want to encourage you to live a higher
[15:13] standard that's what I'm speaking on
[15:15] today persuading you to live higher
[15:19] there is the social persuasion this is
[15:22] an interesting one uh it's basically
[15:25] saying uh you need to do this because
[15:27] everybody else is doing it and uh you
[15:30] know the devil loves that when he uses
[15:33] that one you know well and I just say
[15:34] well if he uses that one well you know
[15:37] why shouldn't I use it because you know
[15:39] I I'm not here with his kind of of of
[15:41] social persuasion to say to you you know
[15:45] all the say to you sisters all the
[15:48] Hollywood starlets are doing it why
[15:50] don't you do it too that's the devil's
[15:51] argument my argument is listen sisters
[15:54] there's other sisters around you
[15:56] striving you're not in this alone
[15:58] Brothers there's other men striving I
[16:01] want to give you today a social
[16:03] persuasion you have a family of God
[16:06] gathered around you I say to young
[16:08] people you have parents you have
[16:10] ministers let me persuade you to say
[16:13] that there are other people who are
[16:16] overcoming I remember when I asked our
[16:19] resident superhero sister Gene how in
[16:22] the world she was so okay and I quite
[16:25] seriously I was so shocked you know here
[16:28] she loses a husband of 60 plus years and
[16:33] a son of 50 years and all in the space
[16:36] of 13 months and I and I said to her I
[16:39] said Mom
[16:40] and people are asking me how is she she
[16:43] just seems so strong I said Mom how are
[16:45] you okay and she said you know she said
[16:48] I I have my times when I cry she said I
[16:51] I'm I'm grieving she said I said but how
[16:54] do you how do you how do you come out
[16:56] every day and you just seem okay she
[16:59] said Jason I have to be okay
[17:01] and I said what is that what does that
[17:03] mean she said I'm not the first daughter
[17:07] of God down through centuries to lose a
[17:10] husband and lose a child she said there
[17:12] have been many Gallant women Mighty
[17:14] women of God before me who lost husbands
[17:17] and who lost sons and who lost more than
[17:19] I've lost and they pressed on and they
[17:22] kept carrying on oh it was such an
[17:24] inspiration to me you know that there
[17:27] are people around you striving there are
[17:29] people around you pressing the battle to
[17:32] reach the millennial world to finish the
[17:35] race you know the people who reach it
[17:38] will have completed a race I think about
[17:41] that
[17:42] you know that that I didn't step aside
[17:45] with the world and come up short I want
[17:49] to make the millennium
[17:50] I want to I want to finish this race I
[17:54] don't want to be stepped uh moved aside
[17:57] uh and you know pull off into an
[18:00] emergency Lane and Coast to a stop
[18:02] because I'm all out of gas or or My you
[18:05] know I haven't maintained my Christian
[18:07] Life no I want to run this race and I
[18:11] want to persuade you to live higher with
[18:14] me I want to persuade you to say let's
[18:16] press on to the millennium
[18:20] see and so you know we there's all kinds
[18:24] of ways we could go on and on about you
[18:27] know talk persuading people you know
[18:29] serving God is a way of expressing our
[18:33] love and our gratitude to him uh you
[18:38] know for all that he has done for us so
[18:40] when I am persuading people to live
[18:42] higher you know I I want to remind
[18:45] people just how very much that you owe
[18:48] the Lord say how much do I owe him
[18:50] nothing short of everything
[18:52] that we were all on our way to hell and
[18:56] no way to stop it except God rich in
[19:00] Mercy and so when we when we when we
[19:03] segue to that and we say serving God
[19:07] is a way
[19:08] expressing our love and our gratitude
[19:11] then according to the Bible we and I
[19:15] want to just give and I'm not going to
[19:16] take you into the scriptures today
[19:17] because you're there you trust me
[19:18] they'll be familiar to you I'm just
[19:20] going to quote from them somewhat in
[19:22] paraphrase but according to the Bible
[19:25] that there are a number of ways to serve
[19:28] God first of all loving him with all
[19:32] your heart and all your soul and all
[19:35] your mind you know Christianity has
[19:38] sometimes standardized answers almost
[19:41] sometimes I think sometimes it almost
[19:44] comes across as canned answers almost
[19:46] like wow surely there's more to it than
[19:49] just a you know a canned answer I think
[19:52] that you know we talk about loving our
[19:54] neighbor as ourself we talk about being
[19:57] kind to strangers we talk about praying
[19:59] for those in need we talk about you know
[20:02] sharing things and and and and and Jesus
[20:05] talks about if someone needs this and
[20:07] give them that plus this and if they ask
[20:09] you to walk this far you walk that Farm
[20:10] you know we you know we think about
[20:12] widows and orphans and and all of these
[20:15] things but a lot of times those can
[20:17] become not so much
[20:20] um they are a higher standard not
[20:22] against those things but I think that it
[20:24] ought to come from our heart it ought to
[20:27] not just to be a higher standard to me I
[20:30] guess is what I'm trying to say is that
[20:32] a higher standard is not just
[20:34] regulations that you can move up the the
[20:38] list and live uh higher standards than
[20:41] that you know you know we can talk about
[20:44] being holy and avoiding sin these are
[20:48] ways to live higher discovering and
[20:52] being willing to use and as the Bible
[20:54] says exercising our gifts you know
[20:57] Christianity to me is an active
[20:59] lifestyle it's not passive it's not just
[21:03] you know I I'm just I I you would never
[21:06] know I'm a Christian unless I tell you I
[21:08] am no I believe a Christian lifestyle is
[21:11] an active I think it has an aura I think
[21:14] it projects I find that when love
[21:16] projects Grace takes over
[21:19] and so so when we when we think about
[21:22] being willing to go the extra mile and
[21:25] being willing to exercise our gifts and
[21:27] being willing
[21:28] being willing to reach out there and and
[21:32] expend our energy and expend our
[21:34] resources that's what being a Christian
[21:37] really is see doing everything here's
[21:39] another good one doing everything now
[21:42] catch this doing everything in the name
[21:46] of the Lord Jesus Christ whatsoever you
[21:49] do in word or deed you're supposed to do
[21:51] all to me that has always said to me
[21:54] that whatever I cannot do in the name of
[21:58] the Lord Jesus Christ I should not do
[22:01] if there's ever a question in your life
[22:03] and say is this right or wrong just ask
[22:05] yourself can I can you say that cruel
[22:09] cutting sentence to a friend in the name
[22:14] of Jesus Christ
[22:15] could a husband cut a wife down or a
[22:18] wife cut a husband down could you do
[22:20] that in the name of Jesus Christ
[22:22] teenagers could you could you mistreat
[22:25] one another in the name of Jesus Christ
[22:27] could you disrespect the ministry in the
[22:30] name of Jesus Christ I think not I think
[22:33] not could we find ourselves out living a
[22:36] life of carnality so that the world
[22:38] doesn't really notice a fervent
[22:41] lifestyle I don't think you can do that
[22:43] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[22:46] so so we need to do everything we need
[22:49] to be steadfast we need to be immovable
[22:53] abounding in the work of the Lord
[22:55] presenting our bodies as Living
[22:58] Sacrifice this is me today persuading
[23:02] you to live higher to live more mature
[23:05] to live more spiritual to to present
[23:09] your bodies a Living Sacrifice to be
[23:11] steadfast to be immovable to be
[23:13] abounding in the work of the law Lord
[23:16] not just when it's convenient
[23:19] to me this is exactly why the most
[23:21] important way to serve God
[23:24] is to love him
[23:27] to me that has to be the basis of it all
[23:30] to love him with all of our heart as I
[23:33] said with all of our soul and all of our
[23:37] mind it's it it literally loving God let
[23:41] me say it like this loving God is what
[23:44] makes your works perfect
[23:47] because if you're just doing them as
[23:49] Works they're they're of no use to God
[23:53] your best efforts are filthiness to him
[23:56] so the only way to have your works
[23:59] perfect is to love God and if you if you
[24:02] work out of love for God then it doesn't
[24:05] really matter what the work is
[24:07] it doesn't matter you don't have to do
[24:09] everything I do I don't have to do
[24:11] everything you do we love God see and so
[24:15] so to me this is what Jesus said was
[24:18] actually the greatest commandment
[24:21] and is really to me the natural everyday
[24:24] life of a Christian
[24:26] when we love God I find that in my
[24:31] experience that I naturally obey him it
[24:34] it's it it's it's not even second nature
[24:37] it is my nature because my love for God
[24:41] and even if I Stumble I I I I I'm very
[24:45] quick to correct and repent and ask the
[24:48] Lord to help me see because because
[24:50] loving God is the foundation of my
[24:55] service to him it means it means more
[24:58] than anything in the world to me it's
[25:00] everything and so so so you know when I
[25:04] say that I love God I'm saying that I
[25:06] love him with all of my emotions I love
[25:09] him with all of my desires I love him
[25:12] with all of my affections can you say
[25:15] that today to say my affections are set
[25:18] on things above you know not on this
[25:21] world but with all of its distractions
[25:23] and and sidebars it means to have a
[25:27] passionate Devotion to him and and I and
[25:30] and I say a delight in his presence for
[25:35] me friends I can tell you this many
[25:37] years walking this road as a Christian
[25:39] man there is nothing more refreshing
[25:42] than the presence of God there is
[25:45] nothing more strength giving nothing
[25:48] more cleansing nothing more invigorating
[25:51] and renewing of my mind nothing will
[25:54] alleviate stress and anxiety that's a
[25:56] plague you know that's released in the
[25:58] atmospheres that we live in today if
[26:01] brother Branham called it a plague a
[26:03] neurotic age and there is no remedy uh
[26:07] to cure that for the world the only way
[26:10] you deal with that is to escape it into
[26:13] the presence of God see so you're you're
[26:16] it's not you can't pray and say Lord
[26:18] take this from the earth that's not
[26:19] going to happen the Earth is going into
[26:21] madness and you you can't say Lord stop
[26:24] letting the devil put put anxiety on me
[26:27] that's not a prayer God can answer
[26:29] because God has already agreed with
[26:32] Satan to make your mind the Battleground
[26:35] so now he can't very well say to Satan
[26:38] sorry you can't trouble his mind anymore
[26:39] because he asked me not to let you the
[26:41] agreement was the the mind would be the
[26:44] Battleground so so you can't cure the
[26:47] neurotic age and you can't you can't get
[26:50] an injunction against Satan for trying
[26:53] to trouble you what you can do is escape
[26:55] to Jesus what you can do is lift up as
[26:59] an eagle and fly up into higher Realms
[27:02] oh I'm I hope I'm persuading you today
[27:05] to live higher oh my and so you know
[27:09] loving him with all of your heart and
[27:11] all of your soul means to love him with
[27:13] your mind it means to love him with your
[27:15] reasoning it means to love him with your
[27:17] Intel intellect to bring all of your
[27:19] thoughts subject to the word of God
[27:22] loving God with your whole heart your
[27:25] whole mind to me is the greatest
[27:27] commandment because because it's
[27:30] literally if you think of it like this
[27:32] it's literally the foundation of all of
[27:35] other Commandments
[27:37] that loving God with your whole heart
[27:40] and your whole mind and your whole soul
[27:41] that is the foundation of all other
[27:45] Commandments and yet people
[27:49] go at Breakneck speed to do service for
[27:55] God but the love of God is missing from
[27:58] their heart and and and and we there's
[28:02] only one way to get the love of God in
[28:04] your heart it has to be poured in there
[28:06] by the Holy Ghost see and so so we need
[28:11] God's grace and God's power to help us
[28:14] to love him you know as he deserves to
[28:17] be loved because it's you know it I mean
[28:20] really Jesus is the only one if you
[28:23] think about it like this
[28:24] you have no chance to do this Jesus was
[28:27] really the only one to love God
[28:31] perfectly
[28:32] to me what I am aware of that and I
[28:36] realize that I I never can make make
[28:39] that great I Can't Get Enough altitude
[28:41] to do that I can't I I wish I could say
[28:45] that you know the the enemy cometh but
[28:48] he findeth nothing in me there's plenty
[28:50] that he finds in me but when he came to
[28:52] the Lord he had no chance Jesus served
[28:56] God perfectly and the beauty of it is he
[28:59] did it on my behalf and your behalf how
[29:02] could I not love him how could I not
[29:04] want to lift higher see
[29:08] so you know brother Branham May makes
[29:11] this statement here watch
[29:13] he says here in things that are to be
[29:15] now he says let me let me get myself
[29:17] said he says if we I'm doing good man
[29:21] I'm doing good praise the Lord
[29:23] he says now if we are are those
[29:26] attributes of God
[29:28] we cannot live by Creeds say Amen to
[29:31] that
[29:32] we cannot live by denominationalism we
[29:35] can't
[29:36] we can't it's not in us it's uh you know
[29:40] that that eagle has to have a certain
[29:42] kind of food he just can't eat the diet
[29:44] of other foul we must live by the word
[29:49] because the bride here's why because the
[29:52] Bride is a part of the bridegroom like
[29:55] any wife is a part of her husband see
[29:57] and so so when when there's when there's
[30:01] that love affair going on between a
[30:03] husband and a wife it's it's it's a love
[30:06] affair to the exclusion of all other
[30:08] loves that it loves supremely in it and
[30:12] and it willingly stands to take a vow I
[30:15] will keep to thee only you know and
[30:18] because that's the desire of the heart
[30:20] imagine how Amplified that becomes when
[30:23] you become a living reality of the Holy
[30:26] ghost-filled person and the literal Life
[30:28] of Christ is now living in you as
[30:31] brother JD said permeating throughout
[30:33] your body taking over your thoughts and
[30:35] your mind and your reason reasoning and
[30:37] your intellect and and informing your
[30:40] thinking how that you can go about your
[30:42] daily life and live Higher and Higher
[30:45] and Higher and every day you can wake up
[30:48] and say today I want to live higher than
[30:50] I did yesterday and tomorrow I want to
[30:53] live higher than I do today friends
[30:55] that's got to be let me persuade you
[30:59] today that's got to be a deeply rooted
[31:03] down inside of our soul that we owe him
[31:06] everything that he is our everything he
[31:09] is my everything as we sing the song
[31:12] so we find that we must live by the word
[31:17] because
[31:19] that you're an eagle
[31:21] if you don't
[31:22] feed on the word you won't live very
[31:25] good
[31:27] see you have to eat to live but an eagle
[31:31] can't just eat anything and if you
[31:34] really want to soar higher he's not
[31:36] going to hit those high altitudes if
[31:37] he's not eating good and if you want to
[31:39] have those high altitudes then you know
[31:41] what we must live by the word because
[31:46] the bride because the Bride is a part of
[31:48] the bridegroom so quite naturally this
[31:50] is why brother brothers whole point I
[31:53] can't live by man-made denominations
[31:55] there's no way I can't live by Creeds
[31:58] that that's that that's that's microwave
[32:01] food that's reheated I don't no forget
[32:03] that I gotta have I gotta have a fresh
[32:06] seven course meal see and so so he goes
[32:09] on to say watch he says here and when a
[32:12] child of God
[32:14] when that predestinated seat I love this
[32:17] statement when a child of God when that
[32:19] predestinated seed that you was to be
[32:22] and God called you and that little Eagle
[32:25] seed in there heard the word of God it
[32:28] will build on top one word on top the
[32:31] other one on top the other one on top
[32:34] the other one it'll not mix with any
[32:37] Creed ask God I love this statement
[32:41] here's how you can live higher today ask
[32:44] God to pie a word on top of word like
[32:49] that until you become the full stature a
[32:53] Son of God or a daughter of God I don't
[32:57] have to live this low altitude life I
[33:00] actually can ask God like like the
[33:03] disciples said Jesus for their day how
[33:05] do we meet the challenges Lord teach us
[33:07] how to pray and and and and now here
[33:10] we've got a prophet coming into this day
[33:12] to say listen it's got to be the Holy
[33:15] Ghost has got to come in you and and it
[33:18] begins to grow and I I didn't even put
[33:20] the whole quote on here but brother
[33:21] Branham is referencing if you go back
[33:24] and catch this quote he's referencing
[33:26] your New Birth by the Holy Ghost and
[33:28] he's he he's he's showing you it's got
[33:32] to grow
[33:33] it's got to grow I don't know why that
[33:36] gets lost sometimes on preachers who
[33:38] just who just get this mentality get
[33:40] this tunnel vision that you've got to
[33:42] have this electrifying experience that's
[33:44] a one-off and that's it and you're done
[33:46] and and once you get that you're good no
[33:48] this thing is a daily this thing is a
[33:51] growing this thing is every day yes it
[33:54] starts with an initial New Birth but I'm
[33:56] going to tell you something friends I
[33:58] I'd like to believe that I've come a
[34:00] long way from the day when I receive the
[34:02] Holy Ghost I'd like to believe that I
[34:04] have grown in the stature and the grace
[34:07] of of almighty God do you want to
[34:10] believe that about yourself today say
[34:12] Lord help me how can I how can I
[34:15] overcome Lord how can I reach these high
[34:19] altitudes and when I I was listening to
[34:21] that yesterday
[34:22] and brother Branham just makes it so
[34:24] clear and he says ask God
[34:27] ask him go ahead you've got a prophet's
[34:31] Commission
[34:32] today I'm bringing you a prophetic
[34:34] commission ask God lord how can I live
[34:37] higher how I I feel persuaded how can I
[34:41] move higher and and have my mind and my
[34:43] intellect and my reason and my
[34:45] conscience and my desires and my my
[34:47] goals and my works and my every every
[34:49] facet of my life how can I love you more
[34:52] how can I serve you more how can I be
[34:54] more effective how can I get to the
[34:56] millennium
[34:57] amen are do you feel a little bit
[35:00] persuaded today friends
