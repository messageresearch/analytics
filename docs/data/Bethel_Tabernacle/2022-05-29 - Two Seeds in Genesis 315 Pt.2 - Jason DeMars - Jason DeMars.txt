TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] do [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] do [Music] so [Music] everyone god bless you let's stand and pray heavenly father we just come before you lord and we want to lay our hearts before you lord and ask that your your holy spirit would come and take your word and break it open to our hearts lord only you can do that pray that you'd reveal yourself to us more and more lord keep your hand upon each one of us we ask in jesus name amen all right we're going to continue on part two of serpent seed i'm gonna read the opening scriptures genesis 3 14 and 15 and the lord god said unto the serpent because thou hast done this thou are cursed above all cattle and above every beast of the field upon thy belly shalt thou go and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life and i will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed thy offspring and her offspring it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel may the lord add the blessing to the reading of his word you can be seated so we see there there was there the the serpent was changed from being upright two feet could speak could reason to being what we now see as a snake on his belly and secondly we see in that that god put in enmity between the serpent and the woman okay we get that but then he says between the offspring of the serpent and the offspring of the woman all right so is that why we're so afraid of snakes i guess does god does god look at this and say is the story of the bible two different lines one of snakes and one of god's people well no it's not it's not about animals having trouble with humans there is later on it speaks of that with adam and and so forth but uh and and noah but here we're looking at two seed lines and that's what scripture bears record of before we go forward the next screen just to kind of summarize what we talked about last time caleb next screen god's command is to multiply and replenish the earth so that's what he commands them in the beginning then the next thing he says do not eat from the tree of knowledge next you see god putting enmity between two genetic lines the offspring of the woman and the offspring of the serpent then the next thing you see is god cursing the birth process and putting eve's desire towards her husband look at those four things you could see three of them all pertain to each other they all line up they're all the same thought but number two not to eat from the tree of knowledge doesn't fit does it it's not if we're going to take that literally it doesn't fit it doesn't make sense so as we saw before we take it allegorically because scripture itself speaks of the other tree as allegorical what how do we find that that's in in revelation chapter three he says i will give you or chapter two actually i will give to the overcomer to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of god it's it's still there in the midst of the paradise of god it hasn't left and we since we can't literally find a geographical location on planet earth where we can we are cut off from we can't get to it and there's a tree there that if we ate it we would get eternal life it sounds like a mythology we understand it isn't a mythology it's an allegory and it's speaking in uh allegorical terms to eat is the action the tree of knowledge is the life that's behind that action really if you come down to it it's it's headed up in one the tree of life the lord jesus christ i will give you to eat of the tree of life you're going to partake of jesus christ then the tree of the knowledge of good and evil there's some good there's some evil who does that that's the devil summed up in the devil but really what it is is is going backwards looking at that you see that this is god saying don't do it the way i've said to do it reproduce yourself the way i've said to do it don't reproduce another way do it the way god intends and you'll bring forth life we'll look at that more later now let's go into the context of the rest of scripture second corinthians 11 2 and 3 for i am jealous over you with godly jealousy for i have espoused you to one husband that i may present you as a chaste virgin to christ but i fear lest by any means as the serpent beguiled eve through his subtility so your mind should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in christ for if he that cometh preacheth another jesus whom we have not preached or if you receive another spirit which you have not received or another gospel which you have not accepted you might well bear with him look screen so number one the church is engaged as a virgin to christ and this is in type of eve being engaged as a virgin to adam paul fears the church's church's adultery by accepting a false word he then compares that to the original sin if paul fears the church committing adultery and compares it to eve sin then we can conclude by the scripture that eve committed adultery with the serpent it's a it's a that was a perfect perfect logical progression right there that's totally scriptural just to say that adultery you know you read the different things that people speak about brother branham or write about brother branham and how it's just crazy that they believe that the original sin was an adultery my goodness the context of scripture is so clear it's crazy not to see that all right let's go forward proverbs 30 verse 20 such is the way of an adulterous woman she eateth oh she eats eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil which is in the midst of the garden so such is the way of an adulterous woman she eats and wipes her mouth and saith i have done no wickedness so here the act of adultery is spoken of as eating all right song of solomon 4 12 a garden enclosed is my sister my spouse a spring shut up a fountain sealed song of solomon 4 16 a waco north wind and come thou south blow upon my garden that the spices thereof may flow out let my beloved come into his garden and eat his pleasant fruits song of solomon 5 1. i am coming to my garden my sister my spouse i have gathered my myrrh with my spice i've eaten my honeycomb with my honey i've drunk my mind with my milk eat oh friends drink yay drink abundantly oh beloved song of solomon 6 2 my beloved has gone down into his garden to the beds of spices to feed in the gardens and to gather lilies so again allegorical language it's clear we're we're letting scripture interpret scripture script the context of scripture uses the terms eating garden etc attached with this very thing even fruits so it's it's clear from the context of scripture that it's not a far-fetched big nonsense garbage about serpent seed it's so and it's not just brother branham telling us it's from genesis to revelation we wouldn't know i wouldn't know if brother branham didn't tell me i'm not saying that but as you study and read through the scripture it unfolds itself it continually unfolds itself so again he puts enmity between thy seed whose seed the serpent's seed that even the terminology it's not made up terminology who's god speaking to the serpent he has a seed who is it answer the question who is the serpent seed who who is it snakes is it brother mark is it boa constrictors what is he talking about well the context of scripture will teach us that there's two seed lines one is the seed of the serpent one is the seed of the woman we we know ultimately this is a prophecy of jesus christ this is the first declaration of the gospel but you can't take just that and miss the rest because it even jesus points out the two different seed lines genesis let's start right away there's going to be enmity okay where's the enmity let me find let me find out what's where is that going to be genesis 4 8 and cain talked with abel his brother and it came to pass when they were in the field that cain rose up against abel his brother and slew him and then 17 through 19 and cain's knew his wife and she conceived and bear enoch and he builded a city and called the name of the city after the name of his son enoch and unto enoch was born irad and iran beget and lamech took unto him two wives the name of the one was ada and the name of the other zilla so who is the originator of polygamy serpent seed i'll just leave that there genesis 4 20 through 24. and ada bear jabil he was the father of such as dwell in tents and of such as have cattle and his brother's name was jubal he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ and zilla she also bear tubal kane an instructor of every artificer of in brass and iron and the sister of tubal kane was nema and lamack said unto his wives ada and zilla hear my voice e wives of lamech hearken unto my speech for i have slain a man to my wounding and a young man to my hurt if cain shall be avenged seven wholefold truly lamech 70 and sevenfold we see our first tyrant so who invented tyranny serpentseed all right we continue on go to the new testament jesus speaking to the pharisees but now you seek to kill me a man that's told you the truth which i have heard of god this did not abraham you do the deeds of your father then said they to him we be not born of fornication we have one father even god all right why in the world do they say we be not born of fornication well later christian interpreters say well this this means that they think jesus was born of fornication but that's not the context at all the contact is says you're not doing you're doing the deeds of your father you're not doing what abraham did and the jews instantaneously know what he's talking about they know the entire context it's not confusing to them what jesus is saying it's not even a parable he's exactly straight and direct with them and he says we're not born of fornication we have one father even god who's the other father that then jesus was talking about you are of your father the devil next verse and the lust of your father will he will do he was a murderer from the beginning and abode not in the truth because there is no truth in him when he speaks a lie he speaks of his own for he is a liar and the father of it he's the father of murderers and the father of liars who's the first murderer cain so what is jesus saying satan is the father of cain and you pharisees and cain was a liar you're a liar just like him he's con it's so obvious to the jews the the pharisees he's saying you're a bunch of serpent seed you want to kill me because you're doing the works of your daddy and they knew right away oh it's talking about the devil first john 3 12 not as cain who was of that wicked one and slew his brother and wherefore slew he him because his own works were evil and his brother is righteous people will take this and say well it doesn't really say exactly that the devil was cain's father just as he was of that in other words this nature was like the devil well where did he get his nature from if his parents were genetically godly one of them could not be deceived one of them could be deceived and that was the result was cain how was he of that wicked one adam wasn't the wicked one that would mean god was the wicked one it's not going to work if you look at i believe it's the book of luke and in the genealogy notice i don't know if all king james bibles do that but most of them i think do in luke where it goes through the genealogy and it says the son of the son of the son of the son is in italics that means it's not in the original greek it is added for understanding so really what it's doing is of mathat of hell of of of of this is the common way of stating a genealogy so this john saying of the wicked one is simply genealogy we could we could add for increased understandings who was of who is the son of that wicked one that gives a full understanding of what john is writing matthew 13 37 through 39 he has answered and said unto them he that soweth the good seed is the son of man the field is the world the good seed are the children of the kingdom but the tares are the children of the wicked one the enemy that sowed them as the devil the harvest is the end of the world and the reapers are the angels now i know people can people going back in my mind i'm thinking just what's striking me is back in john 8 44 you could say well we're all from noah so this is only spiritual there's no such thing as a pure serpent seed on the earth right now and that would be an accurate statement there is no such thing the serpent seed race the serpent seed genetics is in all of us that's why we're born with a fallen nature because that genetic line got in us that's why we have that's why that we needed the perfect blood of jesus christ that's why we need to be born again our first birth is wrong and so okay yeah that is spiritual now by by election it's not just by genetics and every child born from this family is going to be this and some of the many false doctrines surrounding serpent seed that you know black people say white people are serpent seed and white people say black people are serpent seed come on man we're not stupid it all goes back to noah we're all from one blood we're all the same color just varying degrees of melanin that's not what that's about what this is what this is really about is going looking backwards we understand how this fallen nature got into the human race and looking at that why if it's just spiritual why is it why is the word born of fornication in there why is it speaking of the son of right why would these pictures continually come in why would every context we look at eating of the i want to emphasize this again i think it's important when we look at eating of one of those trees eating of one of those trees produces eternal life okay produces eternal life but i asked the question didn't adam and eve already have eternal life they didn't need to eat anything to get eternal life they had it so what was the issue the issue is what is it going to produce you're going to produce something you're going to produce a fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil cane we're going to produce a fruit of the tree of life jesus christ right so it's by it's about the life source and that life source continues on and that yes it was genetic at one point in time but then the sons of god uh abel's line and the daughters are not able's line cestline and the daughters of men keynes line got together and this became a hybridization now it becomes not it doesn't become physical genetic lines but it comes by election predestinated now it becomes a spiritual line but those just as important is the spiritual line the life what's behind it right that's that's what this is looking at it's the life behind a person and the life that's in you is all is always going to be declare itself if you're predestinated seed you're going to hear the word and that's going to produce the life of your father if you're if if you're spiritually serpentied when you hear the word you're going to hate it you're going to fight against it now we all have a nature in ourselves that will do that until the spirit of god comes and changes us but the import the the main thing looking at all of this to understand is that this seed line continues on otherwise jesus wouldn't talk about it in the new testament it would just be just be an old testament doctrine back there before noah it's a cool thing to understand but it has no application or impact now no it continues forward there's two seeds and brother banham over and over again they're both religious they're both crying out for something for for for something outside of themselves to meet their need but one can recognize can hear and receive and submit to the word one of them hears the word and man they are so angry when you pre just preach just preach the real living manifested word in this hour just watch people declare themselves you see on the missions field it's so happened so many times oh we they we have a wonderful church we have lots of people here and you come and you preach straight the message and you see oh 50 50 30 70. we came and preached the message real real gentlemanly carefully wisely and 70 percent of the church leaves all right well praise the lord every seed declares itself quickly get to that place where you preach the word otherwise you waste a lot of time every seed will declare itself but it's it's make it a confrontation over the word not a confrontation over the authority of the pastor not a confrontation over the we got a nice church nice this a nice that it's about the word amen and that's going to make that's going to make people grow and that's going to make people go we don't want anybody to go we want them all to grow that's our hearts desire so i'm going to just kind of at a breaking point but i'm going to press forward for a few more minutes so screen i think 33 looking at some of the history on this topic in jewish tradition these different rabbis from history you may or may not probably are not familiar with them and also the writing um targum pseudo-jonathan asserted that adam was not the father of cain rather eve was subject to adultery having been seduced either by by either samael the serpent in the garden of eden or the devil himself uh christian exegesis of the evil one in first john 3 10 through 12 have also led some commentators like tertullian to agree that cain was the son of the devil so breaking it breaking that down if you look at jewish writings from history it's very clear that they believed in serpent seed it's not something new it's not something new it's not something invented it's not a 20 20th century doctrine it goes back to the time of jesus and earlier this is a quote from tertullian having been made pregnant by the devil she brought forth a son oh man i've got to quit right here this takes too long to explain we'll we'll quit here let's stand and pray amen heavenly father we're so thankful for your goodness and your mercy lord we pray your blessing on the service today we pray that our hearts would be clear and clean lord lord that you would bless the worship bless the preaching of the word keep your hand lord we we we need you we desperately need you move in lives lord convict our hearts cleanse us from sin encourage our hearts father we ask in jesus name amen god bless you [Music] [Music] [Music] do [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] do [Music] [Music] do [Music] [Music] do [Music] [Music] so [Music] do [Music] [Music] do [Music] [Music]
