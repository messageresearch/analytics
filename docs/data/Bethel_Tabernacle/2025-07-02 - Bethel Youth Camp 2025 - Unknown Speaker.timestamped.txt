[0:01] And why does God let troubles come? God
[0:05] harnesses trouble, puts bits in its
[0:07] mouth and makes it obey him. Those
[0:12] troubles bring us into a closer
[0:14] fellowship with God.
[0:17] There had been no rainbow
[0:19] until the flood came. But after Noah was
[0:24] pressed into that condition that he was
[0:27] in the boat 40 days and nights in a
[0:29] storm and a little heart ditching up and
[0:31] down in the water, it was after the
[0:34] flood was over that he saw the rainbow
[0:37] for its first time.
[0:39] It was Daniel who hath purposed in his
[0:42] heart that he not defile himself with
[0:45] the things of the world
[0:47] and was forced to have trial whether
[0:50] he'd pray to God or go to a lion's den.
[0:54] After the heat was put on and he was
[0:56] thrown into a lion's den, he saw the
[0:59] angel of the Lord standing in the midst
[1:01] of him.
[1:03] Oh, if the church could only wake to
[1:05] itself today to find that after the
[1:08] troubles and trials and laughs and made
[1:11] fun of that we see God in our midst
[1:15] doing great signs and wonders, after
[1:18] it's all passed, then we shall see Jesus
[1:22] at last. Oh, don't let the devil tell
[1:25] you that you just might as well give up.
[1:26] You're already overcoming him by being
[1:29] here tonight. You're already overcoming
[1:31] him by staying with the word. Oh, don't
[1:34] let the devil take your ground. You're
[1:36] still here. You're still You would have
[1:38] given up, but you're still here. Why are
[1:41] you still here? Because something
[1:42] greater in you has brought you here
[1:45] above all of the chaos of the world. You
[1:48] have every reason in the world not to be
[1:50] here, but you're here.
[1:52] We've seen too much. If we wanted to go
[1:54] by man's laws, I could have gave up
[1:56] because of that. I could have gave up
[1:57] because of that. I could have gave up
[1:58] because of that. But you're still here
[2:00] tonight because something in you is
[2:03] crying out. Something something deep in
[2:06] you is crying out for something greater.
[2:08] And there's a deep responding back to
[2:11] you speaking the same language.
[2:14] There's something greater here than Paul
[2:16] Fontaine. There's something greater here
[2:18] than you. There's something greater
[2:19] that's here that's bigger than your
[2:21] problems, bigger than your storm.
[2:24] Somebody is here that's greater than all
[2:26] your past hurts and pains.
[2:29] You got hurt. You got pain. You feel
[2:31] distant from God. There's somebody here
[2:33] that knows everything about that. Never
[2:35] put his seal on that part. He knew he
[2:38] wanted overcomers.
[2:40] So he leaves twothirds of you not yet
[2:44] fully redeemed.
[2:46] But the oneird that is redeemed way out
[2:49] does the other two/3s that ain't
[2:51] redeemed if you'll get it in harmony
[2:53] with God.
[2:55] Don't you see? He wants us to overcome.
[2:58] He's not going to pull us through a pipe
[3:01] and pull us out on the other side and
[3:03] say, "Blessed are they that overcome." I
[3:05] believe the young people in this
[3:07] generation have got more to overcome
[3:10] than any generation that's ever been.
[3:12] And no doubt the Lord Jesus has already
[3:15] told the devil, "Listen, devil. I've got
[3:17] some young people in the message in the
[3:19] last day. They will not bend. They will
[3:23] not bow. They will not compromise.
[3:26] They'll believe my word. They'll defeat
[3:28] you and every one of your demons.
[3:31] There's nothing you can do to stop them,
[3:34] Satan.
