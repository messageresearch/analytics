[25:42] say unto them when ye come into the land
[25:45] which I give you then shall the land
[25:47] keep a Sabbath unto the Lord six years
[25:50] shalt thou sow thy field and six years
[25:53] shalt thou prune thy Vineyard and gather
[25:55] in the fruit thereof but in the seventh
[25:57] year shall be a Sabbath of rest unto the
[26:00] land a Sabbath for the Lord Thou shalt
[26:04] neither sow thy field nor prune thy
[26:06] Vineyard that which groweth of it of its
[26:09] own accord of thy Harvest Thou shalt not

[26:14] Vine undressed for it is a year of rest

[27:38] shall you return every man unto his
[27:40] possession let's go before the Lord
[27:43] Heavenly Father we just thank you for
[27:44] the reading of your word this evening
[27:46] Lord father we're just grateful that
[27:49] you're the one that's going to speak to
[27:50] us Lord we just pray you could anoint
[27:52] our lips father anoint our ears to hear
[27:54] father help me just get out of the way
[27:55] father and just take this thought that
[27:57] you've laid My Heart Lord and deliver it
[27:59] to your people we love you we commit
[28:01] this service to you in the name of Jesus
[28:03] Christ amen may the Lord bless you as
[28:05] you take your seats this
[28:07] evening so I just want to catch a few
[28:09] more uh verses of scripture um and if
[28:12] thou sh and if thou sell Thy Neighbor or
[28:15] buyest ought of thy neighbor's land
[28:17] verses 14 you shall not oppress one
[28:19] another according to the number of years
[28:21] after the Jubilee Thou shalt buy of thy
[28:24] neighbor and according unto the number
[28:25] of years of the fruit you shall sell
[28:27] unto thee according to the multitude of
[28:29] years Thou shalt increase the price
[28:32] thereof and according to the fewness of
[28:34] years Thou shalt diminish the diminish
[28:36] the price of it for according to the
[28:38] number of the years of the fruit do he
[28:40] sell unto thee you shall not therefore
[28:42] oppress one another but Thou shalt fear
[28:45] thy God for I am the Lord your God
[28:47] wherefore you shall do my statutes and
[28:49] keep my command and my judgments and do
[28:51] them and you shall dwell in the land in
[28:54] safety and the land shall yield her
[28:56] fruit and you shall eat your fill and
[28:58] dwell therein in safety and if you shall
[29:01] say what shall we eat the seventh year
[29:04] behold we shall not seow nor Gather in
[29:06] our increase then I will command my
[29:08] blessing upon you in the sixth year and
[29:11] it shall bring forth fruit for three
[29:13] years and you shall seow the eighth year
[29:15] and eat of it of old fruit until the
[29:17] ninth year until her fruits come in ye
[29:20] shall eat of the old store the land
[29:22] shall not be sold forever for the land
[29:25] is mine for ye are strangers and so Jers
[29:28] with me and in all the land of your
[29:30] possessions shall you make a great
[29:33] Redemption for the land so I wanted to
[29:36] catch those verses because the Lord
[29:38] thanks brother the Lord set in order
[29:40] these things to take place here around
[29:42] the time of what the scripture would
[29:44] refer to as the time of Jubilee and as
[29:47] we read the Lord said about every seven
[29:49] years there would be a time of rest unto
[29:52] the land as we read it would be a time
[29:55] where there would be no seeds planted in
[29:56] The Vineyards and there would be know
[29:58] seeds planted in the fields and and if
[30:00] you think about what that meant that
[30:02] this would have to be a time of great
[30:04] faith because he gave this command and
[30:07] this command was going to interrupt
[30:08] their entire way of life but what was
[30:11] amazing was that it was going to be a
[30:13] time of of dependence upon God and upon
[30:16] his Provisions amen and Matthew Henry
[30:19] writes this in a commentary I was
[30:20] reading all labor was to cease in the
[30:23] seventh year as much as daily labor on
[30:25] the seventh day these statutes tell us
[30:28] to beware of covetes for a man's life
[30:31] consists not in the abundance of his
[30:34] possessions we are to exercise willing
[30:37] dependence on God's Providence for our
[30:39] support to consider ourselves the Lord's
[30:42] tenants or stewards and to use our
[30:45] possessions accordingly so see I believe
[30:48] God said recognized that he needed to
[30:51] set up a set up in time a time to order
[30:54] to ensure that his people would be mind
[30:58] that this wasn't their land that they
[31:00] were his people and that he was their
[31:03] God Amen that he was their provider and
[31:06] and you know as good as they may have
[31:08] gotten at what they did as good as as
[31:10] good as they were at farming or as good
[31:12] as they were at their ability at that
[31:14] time it didn't matter there was the
[31:16] everybody was equal on the playing field
[31:18] there you have to stop at this time and
[31:21] rest amen because what happens in in our
[31:23] human tendency is we we tend to want to
[31:26] try to be independent amen we as we grow
[31:29] in life and that's a natural thing but
[31:32] it should never be natural to be
[31:33] independent from God Amen he says in
[31:36] verse 23 that they were sojourners and
[31:38] strangers there you know and one of the
[31:40] provisions that I thought was incredible
[31:42] that he promised was that in the
[31:44] previous year which was the sixth year
[31:46] he said that I'm going to command all of
[31:48] my blessings upon you this is good bro
[31:51] by the way and it shall bring forth
[31:53] fruit for three years so God anticipated
[31:56] they didn't even ask the question he
[31:58] said when they asked the question God
[32:00] anticipated that they were going to ask
[32:02] that question what are we supposed to
[32:03] eat and do because this is the work of
[32:06] our hands this is how we eat this is how
[32:08] we live what are we supposed to do and
[32:10] God had set in order a plan and he
[32:13] always does he always sets in order a
[32:16] plan what shall we eat the seventh year
[32:18] and some notes I read on that verse says
[32:20] thus many Christians and I want you to
[32:22] catch this now there many Christians
[32:25] anticipate evils questioning what they
[32:28] shall do and fearing to proceed in the
[32:31] way of Duty because of that questioning
[32:34] and so sometimes God will set things in
[32:36] order and he won't tell you why he won't
[32:38] he won't tell you the the the sequence
[32:40] of events because he needs you to be
[32:42] dependent upon Him amen we are to be
[32:45] dependent upon God and I believe
[32:48] sometimes what can begin to happen in
[32:49] our life is that we begin to get so used
[32:52] to to sewing crops in our own field amen
[32:54] we get to be so dependent on the things
[32:57] that we possess on our income or or our
[32:59] way of living rather than on God and on
[33:02] his Provisions amen can I get an amen
[33:04] this morning and then when a time comes
[33:07] that God has ordained a rest in your
[33:10] life or or he's ordained a blessing in
[33:13] your life we we're not we're not exactly
[33:16] sure because we've gotten so used to
[33:18] doing things of ourself amen so
[33:20] sometimes he sets things in order to
[33:22] take place so that you can take a rest
[33:25] and to be dependent upon him
[33:29] amen sometimes you can just you we don't
[33:32] want to miss it and you know we can be
[33:33] so anxious or just so worried about what
[33:36] we're supposed to do during that time
[33:38] amen and I need to be reminded of this
[33:40] just as much as anybody else sometimes I
[33:42] get so anxious about the next step and
[33:44] the next step I'm a planner I like to
[33:46] plan I like to know I like to do these
[33:47] things but God needs to you to take a
[33:50] step back and say I am your provider
[33:53] amen how are we going to survive but
[33:56] you'll miss what will happen is is if
[33:58] you find yourself in that place you're
[34:00] going to miss the entire the entire
[34:03] premise of what he wanted you to do is
[34:05] rest is rest in his dependence amen God
[34:09] promised that he would Supply amen that
[34:11] promise is still good today amen we're
[34:14] going to catch a quote in a few minutes
[34:15] on this that the prophet makes and it's
[34:18] along those line lines that really
[34:19] struck me but we read about how God
[34:23] spoke to Moses and he said just to set a
[34:25] little Foundation this this evening he
[34:27] spoke to Moses and he said declare to my
[34:29] people that after seven sabbaths after
[34:33] seven times of them doing this and
[34:35] trusting my commands and watching my
[34:38] word come to pass and being obedient
[34:41] there was going to be something that
[34:43] took place so after seven sabbaths after
[34:45] 49 years there would be something which
[34:48] they which scripture refers to as this
[34:50] Year of Jubilee and you know the the
[34:53] literal translation for that word in
[34:55] Hebrew is actually Ram's Horn so the
[34:57] Year of Jubilee would be the year of the
[35:00] sounding of the Ram's Horn the the Horn
[35:03] of a ram W was how they made these
[35:06] trumpets in the days of the Old
[35:08] Testament amen and if you search the
[35:10] scriptures and you watch how how it
[35:13] would be the Lord's Supernatural
[35:15] Provisions that he would create a ram in
[35:18] the wilderness you remember when Abraham
[35:20] had a need amen he created a ram and it
[35:23] was by his horn that he was caught in
[35:25] the thickets amen and it was by that
[35:28] provision that God provided a sacrifice
[35:31] amen and it was by that provision that
[35:33] he always intended to provide a
[35:36] sacrifice it was by the Ram's Horn
[35:38] Hallelujah and he said he said to to
[35:41] Abraham he said take Isaac up and and
[35:44] sacrifice him yet Abraham's Faith
[35:46] declared and and we know this but
[35:48] Abraham's Faith declared that we both
[35:51] him and my son will return amen and it
[35:54] was at that appointed time that
[35:56] Abraham's faith in God caused a ram to
[36:00] get stuck in a Thicket amen and that
[36:03] would be the very thing that Abraham
[36:05] needed to save his son at that point and
[36:07] I love I love how scripture makes it so
[36:10] specifically clear that it was the horn
[36:12] of the ram that got caught in the
[36:15] thicket amen Genesis 2213 and just
[36:18] catching some types here this evening
[36:20] you know and it was that very spot in
[36:22] the mountain is where Abraham was so
[36:25] inspired that he dedicated that place
[36:27] and we know it to be called Jehovah drra
[36:30] amen my provider for God hath provided a
[36:33] sacrifice and it was always to point to
[36:36] Christ the great sacrifice amen he
[36:38] provided himself a sacrifice for you
[36:41] amen yes amen you know we read of
[36:43] another place in scripture
[36:45] there
[36:47] Ezekiel chapter 33 how the blowing of a
[36:50] trumpet would actually be a warning sign
[36:53] Ezekiel 33 that whosoever heareth the
[36:56] sound of a trumpet and taketh not
[36:58] warning if the sword come and take him
[37:00] away his blood shall be upon his own
[37:03] head am he heard the sound of a trumpet
[37:05] and took not warning his blood shall be
[37:07] upon him but he that taketh warning
[37:09] shall deliver his soul so so what we see
[37:12] in Ezekiel that is if you hear the sound
[37:14] of a trumpet but you didn't take notice
[37:16] it could be the sound of an impending
[37:18] doom for you but if you took notice of
[37:21] the sound of the Horn of the trumpet
[37:23] then it could save your soul amen so for
[37:26] one people it's a a sign of impending
[37:29] judgment but for another people it's a
[37:31] sign of warning and a sign of Victory
[37:34] amen you know and back there in
[37:36] Leviticus scripture says that it was
[37:37] going to be on the 10th day of the
[37:40] seventh month and what what I found that
[37:41] was so incredible about this specific
[37:43] time was that after this time it
[37:46] actually fell on a year that followed a
[37:48] Sabbath amen and so the law of the
[37:50] Sabbath year was still in play so there
[37:53] was a law of Sabbath that said you need
[37:55] to take a rest for an entire year and
[37:57] then upon the seventh time that that
[37:59] happened there would be another year of
[38:01] rest and it would be called the land the
[38:03] the the time of the Jubilee so this
[38:05] would be multiple years of rest and
[38:07] multiple years of trust so God had
[38:10] provided all the way back in Leviticus
[38:12] at the start of that scripture he said
[38:14] that I'm going to provide and it's going
[38:16] to it's going to bring fruit for us for
[38:18] three years amen there was a purpose in
[38:20] doing that even though he didn't need
[38:22] fruit for 3 years at the beginning he
[38:24] needed it because at the seventh time it
[38:26] would happen there would be need for
[38:28] that
[38:29] amen it was it would be again a time set
[38:32] apart for you and and and you will
[38:34] observe the same statute set about in
[38:37] the Sabbath year according to the law so
[38:40] you had the same you had the same
[38:42] statutes you you you were to take a rest
[38:44] and it would be another year where you
[38:46] wouldn't farm and crop and you wouldn't
[38:48] Harvest but this time it would be for a
[38:50] different reason you know and I thought
[38:52] about just how Supernatural that was in
[38:55] those times where this again this was
[38:57] their way of life and now now after
[38:59] doing that for so many years there was a
[39:01] command by this law to take not just one
[39:05] but two years and not do a certain thing
[39:08] and God's promise would to be provide
[39:10] for their needs amen you know and I
[39:12] thought about how the amazing thing is
[39:14] is he didn't he doesn't just give
[39:16] commands and he does I'm just speaking
[39:19] spiritually tonight he doesn't just give
[39:20] these commands and he doesn't and not
[39:22] have a plan in order amen he always has
[39:25] a plan set in order for whatever tells
[39:27] you to do amen you may not always know
[39:29] the plan but he has a plan amen and the
[39:32] Bible writes that you shall eat the
[39:35] increase there of the of the field amen
[39:39] and you shall you know and I thought
[39:40] maybe maybe it was because maybe that
[39:43] would be mindful and maybe store up some
[39:46] years of plenty you
[39:47] know he he always he always tells he
[39:51] always tells a certain portion enough to
[39:54] where you know what you need to do but
[39:56] maybe not the next step amen and one
[39:59] commentator wrote how two years in
[40:01] succession would have to be a serious
[40:04] test of faith because they were called
[40:06] upon to trust totally in God and
[40:09] acknowledge in a profound way that he
[40:11] was the provider of the basic
[40:13] necessities of life amen you know and
[40:17] just so for a simple concept of faith in
[40:19] this subject tonight it's the Simplicity
[40:21] of learning to trust God for your
[40:23] Provisions you know and we can't you
[40:25] can't allow yourselves to get so so
[40:27] reliant on on the working of your own
[40:30] hands that you lose dependence upon God
[40:33] Amen you know I so I put some thought
[40:35] into this this term tonight and so I
[40:37] wanted to to to bring this out faith in
[40:40] our life should become habitual it
[40:42] should be a habit amen and I want you to
[40:44] listen to this definition
[40:46] tonight to be habitual means a behavior
[40:49] that is repeated regularly often
[40:52] unconsciously or completely involuntary
[40:56] amen that should be faith in our life it
[40:58] should be come it should come to a point
[41:00] where it's habitual in your life where
[41:02] where it just happens where it's a part
[41:05] of you amen you don't that God doesn't
[41:06] have to to push you or urge you to do it
[41:08] you just do it because it's in you to do
[41:10] it amen amen and I I love how the
[41:13] prophet always makes things so simple um
[41:16] you know and I've made this statement
[41:17] before I'm going to read this quote in
[41:18] just a minute but I've made the
[41:19] statement here before but it's just
[41:21] repeating a concept that the prophet
[41:23] makes over and and over and over again
[41:25] Faith isn't some far-reaching
[41:27] unattainable thing amen it's never been
[41:30] that way it's a tangible substance amen
[41:33] that Believers can grab a hold of
[41:35] regardless of your past failures or your
[41:38] past faults amen it's the Simplicity of
[41:41] trusting God and trusting in what he
[41:44] says which means trusting in his word
[41:47] amen and believing his word brother
[41:49] Brandon picks this up in a CLE uh sermon
[41:51] titled the Inside Man 1953 and he's
[41:54] talking about when Jesus
[41:57] um passes that fig tree amen you
[41:59] remember the story he passes that fig
[42:01] tree and he was seeing how it was
[42:03] bearing no fruit so he spoke to it and
[42:05] and Jesus had spoke to that tree and
[42:07] then he and then he walks away and the
[42:09] next morning they walk past that tree on
[42:12] their way somewhere else and Peter takes
[42:15] notice of it and asks God about it and
[42:17] Jesus answered and said have faith in
[42:19] God so it was it was a lesson on faith
[42:23] and and in the moment and I wanted to I
[42:25] wanted you to catch this in the moment
[42:26] that Jesus spoke to that tree life went
[42:29] out of it amen but Peter didn't take
[42:31] notice of it until the next morning and
[42:34] sometimes in your life when you have
[42:36] something in your heart God places to
[42:38] tell you to do if you have faith and
[42:40] it's a revelation from God the moment
[42:42] that you speak it as long as it's a
[42:44] revelation in his word it's going to
[42:46] come to pass you may not take notice of
[42:48] it right away but it doesn't mean it
[42:50] didn't happen amen hallelujah brother
[42:53] benam says this he says as I read it now
[42:56] keep these things on mind what I've told
[42:58] you keep them on mind see Jesus passed
[43:01] by a tree he's talking about the story
[43:03] he looked on it there was no fruit on it
[43:04] and he said no man eateth from off of
[43:07] you from henceforth so he went up onto
[43:09] Jerusalem of course they was fussing at
[43:11] him up there and he couldn't stand that
[43:13] so there was the wrong kind of
[43:14] Atmosphere for him so he moved out and
[43:16] went on back down he come off the off
[43:19] the mountain the next morning and as
[43:21] they passed by at about 11:00 in the day
[43:23] I suppose Peter looked at the tree and
[43:25] he said say notice said you just said
[43:28] that yesterday and that tree is dead
[43:30] from The Roots see it dried up why Jesus
[43:33] said have faith in God is that right for
[43:35] verily I say unto you if you not if I if
[43:39] you shall say unto this mountain be
[43:41] moved and don't doubt it'll obey you it
[43:43] have to it have to do what you say if
[43:46] you didn't doubt it now you believe it
[43:48] up here and I want you to catch this
[43:50] next statement he makes he says now
[43:52] let's get this subconscious believing it
[43:55] too and when the sub Sub Conscious and
[43:57] the conscious get in harmony with God
[44:01] then it'll happen amen when the
[44:03] subconscious and the conscious when the
[44:05] Inside Man and the outside man get in
[44:07] harmony with with each other then you
[44:10] say to this mountain that's why God said
[44:12] that and and and if you go on and read I
[44:14] wanted to read this from Matthew 19 the
[44:16] Amplified version and he said so when
[44:19] the disciples saw it they were
[44:21] astonished and asked how is it that the
[44:23] fig tree has withered away all at once
[44:26] and Jesus replied to them I assure you
[44:29] most solemnly to say to you if you have
[44:32] faith and I wanted to pick the Amplified
[44:34] because it said if you have faith a
[44:36] personal trust and confidence in me and
[44:38] do not doubt or allow yourself and catch
[44:41] this or allow yourself to be drawn in
[44:44] two directions you will not only do what
[44:47] was done to the Fig Tree but even if you
[44:50] say to this mountain be taken up and
[44:51] thrown into the sea it will happen if
[44:54] God wills it amen and whatever you ask
[44:56] for in prayer believing you will receive
[44:59] amen if you have faith a personal trust
[45:03] and confidence in me it says and don't
[45:06] doubt amen or even allow yourself to be
[45:09] drawn in two directions like that
[45:11] scripture says so he spoke to the tree
[45:13] and Peter didn't notice it but it was at
[45:16] that moment that God's that God spoke to
[45:19] it that something happened so what I'm
[45:21] trying to get at is Faith isn't some
[45:22] kind of workup amen Faith isn't Faith
[45:25] isn't you trying to up something faith
[45:28] is trusting God in a simplistic Manner
[45:31] and you speaking to something and it's
[45:33] going to come to pass because you
[45:35] believe it amen it's a simple belief in
[45:37] God and even if something takes a little
[45:39] while in your life to manifest or to
[45:42] notice sometimes the moment that you're
[45:44] inspired with the word from God and you
[45:46] take it at his word take him at his word
[45:48] it's come to pass amen Jesus didn't
[45:51] Wonder Jesus didn't wonder whether or
[45:53] not his word was going to come to pass
[45:55] amen he used that you know Jesus used
[45:58] that moment as a teachable moment to
[46:00] Peter he to tell him no all you got to
[46:02] do is is you just got to believe it I
[46:04] spoke to it and believed it he believed
[46:06] it but God used that as a moment to tell
[46:08] Peter because Peter was going to do
[46:09] great things amen
[46:11] amen and the pro the problem with us and
[46:14] I that really struck me because the
[46:16] problem with us so many times is that we
[46:18] allow ourselves to be drawn into two
[46:21] directions just like that verse reads
[46:23] amen we believe and you know we think we
[46:26] have this conscious Faith but the
[46:28] problem is is that it's not operating in
[46:30] our
[46:31] subconscious and brother brandham said
[46:32] it so beautifully in that quote that
[46:34] there's a lack of Harmony there amen and
[46:37] and you remember that word I said
[46:38] earlier with habit you know we have to
[46:40] allow Faith to become habitual common
[46:43] every day practiced regularly so being a
[46:46] Believer you know you feed the inner man
[46:49] with the word amen and the word changes
[46:52] the way you think it changes the way you
[46:54] act it changes the way you live amen you
[46:56] know and so we hear the word preached
[46:58] and and we may believe it but then we go
[47:00] out and we live in a society that
[47:02] doesn't trust God Amen and and where
[47:05] everybody is putting their trust in in
[47:07] in governments and in supposedly good
[47:09] people and and reforms and all these
[47:11] programs and those things are nice and
[47:13] they're good but it's going to fail one
[47:15] day amen the only thing that won't fail
[47:17] is God's word and there brother renom
[47:20] says it like this there's an inside man
[47:22] and he's steering the boat amen and if
[47:25] we can harmonize the two the prophet
[47:28] says then it'll happen Hallelujah then
[47:31] it'll
[47:32] happen brother bom says it like this he
[47:34] says he says do you ever think that
[47:36] Inside Man of of your body is another
[47:39] man did you know that there's another
[47:41] man inside of your body and that's a
[47:43] spirit man did you ever think of that
[47:45] brother Ryan to see what yes sir that
[47:50] that how this is in here the Inside Man
[47:52] is of God the spirit of God is that
[47:55] right that's inside our being now my
[47:57] finger could not move without something
[47:59] making it move it works from an
[48:02] intelligence here that the Mind
[48:04] subconsciously just maybe if I'd happen
[48:06] to think or reach over here I don't have
[48:08] to think about it it just looked like
[48:11] now where the faith lays now to you
[48:13] people that's really sick and he's
[48:14] trying to get this the people this to
[48:16] this Simplicity I want to get this to
[48:18] you before I read the scriptures now
[48:21] since last night I got I let myself down
[48:23] a little bit there is a conscious and
[48:25] there is a sub conscious it's like if we
[48:28] start overseas by a ship he says and if
[48:30] there's a man sitting there and he's the
[48:32] one who gives the orders the man goes
[48:34] down in the ship to run the ship down
[48:36] well we don't see where he's going amen
[48:39] but he just takes the orders from up
[48:41] above well now he says steer to the left
[48:43] to the right or give the engine more or
[48:45] that or whatever it is he just works by
[48:47] orders but way down in the midst of us
[48:50] here in our heart is the subconscious
[48:53] and it takes orders from up there amen
[48:56] and I want to catch this subconscious
[48:58] means that it's existing in the mind but
[49:01] not immediately available to the
[49:03] Consciousness so what it is is it
[49:05] basically it affects your thought your
[49:07] feeling your behavior without entering
[49:10] into the awareness amen it's your
[49:13] subconscious motives in simple terms
[49:15] it's the aspect of our mental thought
[49:18] process that
[49:19] influences emotions and behavior amen so
[49:22] there's something that's a part of you
[49:24] that's somewhere deep inside of you that
[49:26] influences you and and influences what
[49:29] you do it influences what you say it
[49:32] influences where you go amen and and
[49:35] what what can what the scientific world
[49:37] has has come to realize through years of
[49:40] study and the correlation that there's a
[49:42] there's a connection there to the health
[49:44] of your body and your mind amen and I I
[49:47] know this sounds like some psychology
[49:48] but they just steal it from God anyway
[49:50] amen the the scientific world has come
[49:53] to just barely understand the surface of
[49:55] this amen and what they do is they
[49:57] create these solutions to the problems
[50:00] but what happens is is the solution to
[50:02] the problem becomes more of a problem
[50:04] than the original problem was amen they
[50:06] have these medicines and they have these
[50:08] things and they have these anti- all
[50:10] these things but it just creates more
[50:12] and more problems all it lays in here is
[50:15] a faith in God that you need to let that
[50:17] subconscious man be driven by this amen
[50:20] and then then your your conscious man
[50:23] will automatically do exactly what's
[50:25] gone down on the inside
[50:28] amen you know and if you go just read
[50:30] the Bible he God explains these con
[50:32] these Concepts just like we read just in
[50:34] a simplistic manner that you can grab a
[50:36] hold of that you can be delivered that
[50:38] you can be healed that you can be set
[50:40] free and I'm so thankful for that
[50:43] amen amen that's what the Jubilee is for
[50:47] it's for you amen it's it's something to
[50:49] grab a hold of it's it's not trying to
[50:51] grasp something that seems so
[50:53] unreachable it's it's so you can grab
[50:54] onto a reality of the simplicity of
[50:57] faith in God Amen brother bam you read
[50:59] what brother bam says um in the inside
[51:01] man um he says now you've heard me on
[51:04] the platform many times no doubt I was
[51:06] just hearing a tape from the Owensboro
[51:07] meeting the other day about a person who
[51:09] was crippled and healed and how it was
[51:11] speaking how the Holy Spirit speaking
[51:12] now up here this conscious comes to the
[51:15] platform brother Brandon praise the Lord
[51:17] I have faith but right down there in the
[51:19] other conscious says now no you haven't
[51:22] well now if you can get this one and
[51:24] that one in harmony with that one you
[51:26] see
[51:27] this one's saying yes all the time this
[51:29] one's saying yes but way down in here
[51:31] there's something a little fellow just
[51:33] see you want to make it you want to say
[51:36] yes but it just down there a little
[51:38] shadow that may if you don't deal with
[51:41] this little fellow down here very much
[51:43] well you'll find out that he just kind
[51:45] of does the ruling see so if you don't
[51:48] deal with that then you'll find out that
[51:51] he's the one that does the ruling so
[51:53] then you come you come into a position
[51:55] where you do have a need amen and you do
[51:58] have a a situation and you approach it
[52:01] but brother renom says and he watches
[52:03] and he he would know he he watch these
[52:05] people's spirits and he would say that
[52:06] they had a conscious faith and they they
[52:09] they wanted to believe but something
[52:11] down inside them couldn't grasp they
[52:12] couldn't grab hold of that Faith amen
[52:15] and and what you've got is is this uh
[52:19] you've got this flesh man amen and and
[52:22] you know this this guy he always gets
[52:24] sometimes he gets the better of us amen
[52:27] but you've got to get him in harmony
[52:29] with the one that's deep
[52:30] inside and we read where where you're
[52:33] pulled in two directions you know and so
[52:35] your flesh man you know you want to
[52:37] believe you you hear the word and it
[52:39] says says amen but the one that's
[52:41] driving the ship you may have a little
[52:43] bit of Doubt or you may have a little
[52:44] bit of misunderstanding of the word and
[52:46] then that doubt or that misunderstanding
[52:49] is the thing that's going to manifest
[52:51] amen and so now you can see what the the
[52:55] great value of what our ears listen to
[52:58] or what our eyes see because those
[53:00] things are the pathway to the Inner Man
[53:02] to that subconscious amen and you are
[53:04] what you eat amen if your diet consists
[53:07] of the indoctrination of the world and
[53:09] politics and entertainment then your
[53:11] faith is never going to operate the way
[53:13] that it was meant to operate amen you're
[53:15] you're going to be living in a place
[53:17] where you want to but you're you're
[53:18] you're pulled in two directions like
[53:20] that scripture says and you want to so
[53:22] bad but you also kind of want some of
[53:24] this and you kind of want a little
[53:25] entertainment and you kind of want a
[53:26] little bit of that but you want this so
[53:28] bad you can't be pulled in two
[53:30] directions and operate the kind of faith
[53:32] that God wants you to operate Amen
[53:34] brother random says he says after all
[53:36] this fellow he's the one who drives the
[53:39] ship he's the one who does the steering
[53:42] this one might say a lot but this is the
[53:44] guy that does the work down here say so
[53:47] this one might say oh yes I believe oh
[53:48] sure I do if that's right this is going
[53:51] this and this agrees with that and see
[53:53] then it'll have to work see if this
[53:56] agrees with that then it'll have to work
[53:58] brother benam says amen how do you get
[54:02] it to agree amen but pastor's been
[54:04] preaching on him abiding in him glory to
[54:06] God we we can't put our trust in the
[54:09] things of this world or you know the
[54:12] transformation of of societies they're
[54:15] all going to come to End Amen brother
[54:17] brandom says um says this he says this
[54:19] in in correlation with the sound of the
[54:21] Jubilee He says it's got to come to an
[54:23] end all things are shaking no matter how
[54:26] big they're building a pillar it's got
[54:28] to fall down all things that's not
[54:30] against the word or I'm sorry contrary
[54:32] to it will have to move it'll have to
[54:36] give place because the word is coming
[54:38] triumphantly there's nothing that can
[54:40] stop it God has done said so when he
[54:43] speaks it Heaven and Earth will pass
[54:44] away but it'll never fail hide that word
[54:47] in your heart how to take that word and
[54:50] let it grow keep it in your mind always
[54:53] because it will never fail God God's
[54:56] word will never fail because he said he
[54:58] wouldn't and so we want to keep it on
[55:02] that amen and I did a Sunday school on
[55:03] that and you know brother bham had made
[55:05] this statement he says you know the
[55:07] people come and they say just clear your
[55:09] mind and empty your mind no you need to
[55:11] if you do that you need to allow the the
[55:13] Holy Ghost to come in and the word to
[55:15] come in and saturate your mind amen so
[55:17] that you can operate in that in that
[55:19] place that he wants you to brother bham
[55:22] he uh going on in the rest of that uh he
[55:25] says in if the trumpet gives an
[55:27] uncertain
[55:29] sound now Paul said in the scriptures
[55:31] like training a soldier a soldier to a
[55:34] sound a soldier has got to learn the
[55:37] sound of his bugle or the trumpet he
[55:39] doesn't know if the trumpet blows
[55:41] whether to charge or whether to retreat
[55:44] if he doesn't know the difference what
[55:47] kind of mixed up Army would you have
[55:50] amen the enemy would certainly triumph
[55:52] over a bunch of soldiers that were no
[55:54] better trained than that see so you see
[55:56] so when you go to basic training amen
[55:59] you don't hardly know what you're doing
[56:00] amen there's this thing it's called It's
[56:02] called The Red phrase and and you just
[56:04] you're just going and you're learning
[56:06] and you're being trained as a soldier
[56:07] how to conduct yourself and how to
[56:09] properly yield a weapon and as you go
[56:12] through the motions they begin training
[56:13] you and they begin instilling in within
[56:15] you the characteristics and the training
[56:18] that's required to serve as a soldier
[56:21] amen and you know this thought has just
[56:23] exploded because there's this signal
[56:25] amen if you go on certain military bases
[56:27] there's this signal that plays every
[56:29] morning on certain military bases and
[56:31] it's the rendering of something called
[56:33] Taps amen and if you're in uniform and
[56:36] you're on base when this sound goes off
[56:38] you're trained to stop what you're doing
[56:40] and you're trained to salute in in
[56:43] whatever direction that sound is coming
[56:45] from so you stop what you're doing if
[56:47] you're in uniform and you're trained to
[56:48] know what that means and you're trained
[56:50] to salute amen you're trained to know
[56:52] what that sound means and you're trained
[56:54] to act upon that sound amen
[56:57] and I thought about this concept because
[56:58] there's a few different ways that you
[57:00] can miss out on that sound you know and
[57:02] the first way is if you're untrained in
[57:04] knowing how to recognize it which is
[57:06] part of the subject tonight there's a
[57:08] time during your training that you go
[57:10] through and it's that red phase and it's
[57:12] just the beginning stages where you're
[57:14] just learning amen you know sometimes
[57:15] we're just in this the phase of our life
[57:17] where we're just learning and we're just
[57:19] we're just not exactly sure amen you
[57:21] don't know hardly what's going on and
[57:23] and during that time all that sound seem
[57:26] to you is just an uncertain sound amen
[57:28] it just you know civilians could be
[57:30] walking by and they could hear that
[57:31] sound but if they don't understand what
[57:33] that sound means and if they're not in
[57:35] uniform they don't have to render FLW
[57:36] they don't know they it doesn't matter
[57:38] to them but to the soldiers who have
[57:40] just gone through this rigorous training
[57:42] to know what that sound means they're
[57:45] trained and they're drilled and if they
[57:47] don't they're going to have to they're
[57:48] going to have to do some things amen
[57:50] you're trained to know and to do and act
[57:52] upon that sound amen amen
[57:58] amen and as you're as you're trained
[58:00] you're trained to to continue and
[58:02] brother bom says that's what's the
[58:03] matter with our churches today we're
[58:05] trained on Creeds differing one to
[58:06] another we've got to be United we've got
[58:09] to know a trumpet then which is the
[58:11] trumpet they say the gospel trumpet
[58:14] that's it the word of the Living God is
[58:16] the trumpet you don't mix it with
[58:17] nothing else amen you keep your ears
[58:20] alert to the sounding of that trumpet
[58:22] you know and when the Jubilee took place
[58:25] in levitical times you know and if if
[58:27] there was a people who might have lost
[58:30] their way during Through The Years or
[58:32] they might have found themselves poor
[58:34] and and and destitute or maybe they
[58:36] found themselves in such a way where
[58:37] they had to sell their possessions and
[58:40] and and they were enslaved by their
[58:41] masters but what happened is is their if
[58:44] their ears were fixed to hear that sound
[58:46] there was a designated time and they
[58:48] knew when that time was because they had
[58:50] an inheritance and if they heard that
[58:52] sound amen and they were Rec and they
[58:55] recognized that they could go back to
[58:56] whatever they had possession of amen and
[58:59] they could claim that thing back amen so
[59:02] you better believe they they had their
[59:04] ears fixed on what that sound was amen
[59:06] it was the 49th year it was a certain
[59:09] time in a certain season amen it meant
[59:11] their Liberty it meant their freedom
[59:15] amen it wasn't just another sound you
[59:18] know and just by the grace of God
[59:20] tonight you know I believe I believe
[59:22] we're living in a time oh yeah where we
[59:25] can have our Freedom amen a time where
[59:28] the gospel trumpet is sounding you know
[59:30] and I don't I it doesn't matter what
[59:32] kind of bondage that you've been
[59:33] subjected to it doesn't matter that you
[59:35] might have made the wrong decisions or
[59:37] you might have been enslaved by certain
[59:38] things in the world there is a trumpet
[59:40] of the Gospel amen that is sounded and
[59:43] it's been given to set the captive free
[59:45] to bring Liberty amen and I believe that
[59:48] that one of the the many things that so
[59:49] many people don't realize is that
[59:51] sometimes the devil gets you into a
[59:53] place of of comfortable living or even
[59:56] so distracted by the Affairs of life
[59:59] that that that are causing you to choose
[1:00:01] to stay
[1:00:03] enslaved amen there's a trumpet sounding
[1:00:06] amen and it sounded for a certain time
[1:00:09] amen but there could also be a people
[1:00:11] who missed the sound there could also be
[1:00:13] a people who were so enslaved at a time
[1:00:16] they got comfortable they got
[1:00:18] comfortable living in slavery they got
[1:00:20] comfortable in what they do and they did
[1:00:22] they decided to stay slave to that
[1:00:25] Master I want to stay slave to my master
[1:00:28] amen I want to be free I want to live in
[1:00:30] Liberty amen I believe we can live in
[1:00:32] Liberty tonight you just need to
[1:00:33] recognize the sound you need to act upon
[1:00:36] the sound
[1:00:37] Hallelujah I thought that point was so
[1:00:39] powerful you know God had set all these
[1:00:41] things in order you know and he crafted
[1:00:43] a way for you to get back what the enemy
[1:00:46] has taken from you and to get back your
[1:00:49] lands and to get back your family amen
[1:00:51] but you catch this the slaves had to
[1:00:53] make a decision because if he grew to
[1:00:56] love his master the the one that he had
[1:00:58] been serving he had a relationship with
[1:01:00] it catch this he had a relationship with
[1:01:03] the master that he's serving and that
[1:01:05] Master might have treated him good amen
[1:01:07] he might have given him three Square
[1:01:08] meals a day he might have given him a
[1:01:10] nice place to live he might have taken
[1:01:11] care of his kids and giving them a nice
[1:01:13] education he might have had all these
[1:01:15] nice things but if he chose to stay with
[1:01:17] that Master then it would become a
[1:01:19] permanent decision in his life amen if I
[1:01:22] could just emphasize that the problem is
[1:01:24] that choice is a Permanent Choice amen
[1:01:27] don't allow yourselves to be so trapped
[1:01:29] up in a comfortable way of living
[1:01:32] because they it's so so much so you
[1:01:33] can't hear that sound or you you just
[1:01:35] want to stay enslaved you just want to
[1:01:37] be pulled you're being pulled in that
[1:01:39] second Direction
[1:01:46] amen you can become so numb as to think
[1:01:48] that it's going to be better if I just
[1:01:51] continue like this the rest of my days
[1:01:54] but Saints you'd be missing out on on
[1:01:56] freedom that slave might have not even
[1:01:58] known what it was like he might have
[1:02:00] grown up and not known what it was like
[1:02:02] to have freedom because it happened only
[1:02:04] ever a certain time there was a certain
[1:02:07] designated time that it happened amen so
[1:02:09] he might not have even known so it was
[1:02:10] just comfortable but I promise there's a
[1:02:12] freedom that you can live in amen the
[1:02:14] gospel is a freedom that you can live in
[1:02:17] the message brings Liberty it brings it
[1:02:19] brings you to to a freedom that you may
[1:02:21] not have even ever known
[1:02:24] about amen
[1:02:26] you know I want you to catch this
[1:02:27] tonight because you might struggle as a
[1:02:30] believer in the Affairs of this life
[1:02:33] amen you physically you might have
[1:02:35] sicknesses in your body mentally you
[1:02:37] might get distraught from situations or
[1:02:39] from mind battles financially you might
[1:02:42] not be where you think you you you ought
[1:02:44] to be but I promise God's Eternal reward
[1:02:47] and the sound of that freedom is far
[1:02:50] greater than if you were to stay
[1:02:51] enslaved in a way of comfortable living
[1:02:54] because this will fail this life will
[1:02:56] end but that one never ends
[1:03:00] Hallelujah he offers don't be you can't
[1:03:03] be deceived by the enemy because
[1:03:04] sometimes he offers a pretty deceiving
[1:03:06] plead
[1:03:07] deal you know stay living halfway
[1:03:10] committed to the Lord you know stay
[1:03:11] coming to church and you know half
[1:03:14] halfway serving you know you might be
[1:03:16] better off financially you might have
[1:03:18] you may not have as many woes in your
[1:03:20] life or as many trials or as many things
[1:03:23] but you'll never be living in real
[1:03:25] victory right you'll never understand
[1:03:27] the freedom of what it is to be living
[1:03:29] in Victory
[1:03:31] amen and he's going to he's going to
[1:03:33] offer compromises I was reminded when I
[1:03:35] was studying studying this I was
[1:03:37] reminded
[1:03:38] of when Moses came into the presence of
[1:03:42] pharaoh and Pharaoh said to Moses what
[1:03:44] all do you request to take and I love
[1:03:47] how Moses's response because he held
[1:03:49] nothing back Pharaoh said go serve the
[1:03:52] Lord your God but who are they that
[1:03:53] shall go and Moses said we will go with
[1:03:56] our young and with our old and with our
[1:03:58] sons and with our daughters and with our
[1:04:00] flocks and with our herds we will go for
[1:04:02] we must hold a feast unto the Lord and
[1:04:05] that struck my heart because you need to
[1:04:06] let the devil know what your intentions
[1:04:08] are amen he's going to come and he's
[1:04:10] going to offer plead deals but you need
[1:04:12] to let him know what your intentions are
[1:04:14] I intend to take my victory I intend to
[1:04:17] take my family with me I intend to take
[1:04:20] back what you've stolen from me I intend
[1:04:22] to take my health back from me I even
[1:04:25] intend to take take a little bit of what
[1:04:26] you think you have cuz I'm going to
[1:04:28] offer a praise offering to my God I'm
[1:04:31] going to have a feast because I know
[1:04:33] he's going to deliver me in my time of
[1:04:35] need bless God hallelujah you need to
[1:04:39] let him know oh I'm tired of living in
[1:04:42] fear of the enemy and what he's going to
[1:04:43] do don't live in fear of the enemy I
[1:04:45] don't care what he does to this broken
[1:04:47] down body I don't care what he does I
[1:04:49] want to live in Victory and I want him
[1:04:51] to know that I'm going to have
[1:04:52] everything that he's trying to take from
[1:04:54] me Hal
[1:04:56] Hallelujah I won't lose even one Moses
[1:04:58] left that place and he had something
[1:05:01] rise up in him amen I won't lose even
[1:05:03] one there was there was an inspiration
[1:05:05] that took hold of him amen and I grabbed
[1:05:08] hold of that same inspiration tonight
[1:05:09] because we will not lose even one
[1:05:13] Hallelujah we will not lose even one I'm
[1:05:16] going to take everything
[1:05:19] hallelujah
[1:05:23] hallelujah you're burdened with your
[1:05:25] loved ones I'm going to take him back
[1:05:27] whatever it is that's my intention all
[1:05:30] of it plus some
[1:05:33] amen and you know watch what Pharaoh did
[1:05:36] amen he he offered a compromise he said
[1:05:38] no take your men and go but but leave
[1:05:41] the rest oh but something stirred up in
[1:05:44] Moses and then sometimes sometimes that
[1:05:47] plead deal well I would have freedom and
[1:05:49] my men would have freedom you know but
[1:05:51] there was something inside I'm not
[1:05:53] leaving one behind and I believe that
[1:05:56] same kind of Faith Rises up in fathers
[1:05:59] and mothers in in sons and daughters in
[1:06:02] children who have Wayward parents and
[1:06:05] parents who have wayward children that
[1:06:07] same kind of Faith no I will not leave
[1:06:10] until I know that they are coming with
[1:06:12] me
[1:06:14] Hallelujah glory to God wherever they
[1:06:17] are they're coming with me and you know
[1:06:19] what it got harder after that there was
[1:06:21] a lot more trials there was a lot more
[1:06:23] times but bless God they all got out of
[1:06:25] there Hallelujah and they took their
[1:06:27] flocks and they offered a sacrifice unto
[1:06:29] the
[1:06:30] Lord hallelujah we will leave nothing
[1:06:33] behind brother brandom says you have
[1:06:35] access to every Divine promise
[1:06:37] everything that God has promised and
[1:06:40] nothing less you know and sometimes
[1:06:44] sometimes when Deliverance is on the
[1:06:46] horizon the enemy does everything he can
[1:06:48] to keep you from it you know Pharaoh did
[1:06:51] everything he could even at first you go
[1:06:53] read and you see how Moses when he ini
[1:06:55] came to Pharaoh the Bible says that
[1:06:57] Pharaoh increased the burdens of the
[1:06:59] Israelites you remember that and and and
[1:07:02] and the people got upset with Moses you
[1:07:04] know they they because it got a little
[1:07:05] bit harder you know you know sometimes
[1:07:08] you know God had a plan I I thought this
[1:07:10] was incredible God had a plan way back
[1:07:12] at the burning bush way back before time
[1:07:14] began but there was a plan set in order
[1:07:17] now and Moses knew the plan God talked
[1:07:20] to him at the burning bush he had
[1:07:22] everything set in order but there was
[1:07:23] just a sequence of things that needed to
[1:07:25] happened first amen but the Israelites
[1:07:28] got caught up because the burden got a
[1:07:29] little bit heavy amen don't get caught
[1:07:32] up because the burden seems like it's
[1:07:34] getting a little bit heavy amen don't
[1:07:35] get caught up in the hearing now your
[1:07:38] hearing Now does not dictate the promise
[1:07:41] Hallelujah your present condition does
[1:07:44] not dictate the promise
[1:07:48] hallelujah thank you Jesus your present
[1:07:50] State it's no indication of what God has
[1:07:54] planned for your life that just got me
[1:07:56] that got me so inspired because
[1:07:58] sometimes I just feel so low I feel like
[1:08:00] I don't have any victory in my life I
[1:08:02] feel like these woes I feel I you know
[1:08:04] you feel down but God has a plan amen
[1:08:07] and I'm not going to get caught up like
[1:08:09] those Israelites do and felt so over
[1:08:11] overburdened I'm just going to be living
[1:08:13] in Victory and I'm just going to be
[1:08:15] thanking God and I'm going to be under
[1:08:17] that same inspiration that Moses had
[1:08:19] Hallelujah sometimes you just need
[1:08:21] reminded that and that's okay we're
[1:08:23] humans but be reminded to tonight
[1:08:26] Hallelujah glory to
[1:08:29] God Moses already had his commission
[1:08:34] Hallelujah that's what faith is your
[1:08:36] vision can't be fixed on right
[1:08:42] now my current state may not be where I
[1:08:44] want it to be you know sickness in my
[1:08:47] flesh may have torn me down and
[1:08:48] discouraged me but I rest in God's word
[1:08:52] I rest in his promise he's got the final
[1:08:55] say he's my deliverer amen he's the one
[1:08:58] I trust you know and sometimes because
[1:09:02] the enemy's crafty the the compromise
[1:09:06] might seem a little bit more sensible or
[1:09:09] you know or more comfortable amen you
[1:09:11] know the slaves and and how they they
[1:09:13] could have they could have lived more
[1:09:14] comfortably but we don't look at those
[1:09:16] things amen don't keep your eyes fixed
[1:09:19] on the natural amen I want to have
[1:09:21] spiritual eyes and a spiritual vision
[1:09:25] amen you know the problem with so many
[1:09:27] of those Israelites is that they kept
[1:09:30] the Comforts of Egypt in their heart now
[1:09:33] this is a point that really struck me
[1:09:36] and they were never able to get past
[1:09:39] that you know brother Brenham had that F
[1:09:41] says that so famously the Israelites
[1:09:42] left Egypt but Egypt never left the
[1:09:45] Israelites saints of God you don't ever
[1:09:48] let the Comforts of this world keep you
[1:09:51] living in Egypt amen you could be you
[1:09:54] could be out of Egypt but if your heart
[1:09:56] is back in Egypt then you're still in
[1:09:59] Egypt amen they were never able to get
[1:10:02] into their Promised Land There was a
[1:10:04] huge majority of them that always kept
[1:10:07] they always stayed they should have just
[1:10:08] stayed because they lived there forever
[1:10:10] they could never get past it amen
[1:10:15] oh Pastor pastor's desk back there says
[1:10:18] Comfort The Afflicted but afflict the
[1:10:21] comfortable
[1:10:24] amen praise praise God Amen back to back
[1:10:27] to the Jubilee and you know I was I was
[1:10:29] beginning to think I'm just just a few
[1:10:31] more minutes here beginning to think of
[1:10:33] another thing that can happen so often
[1:10:35] you know as as a soldier one of the
[1:10:37] things that that they train you to do is
[1:10:39] is they you know they train you to
[1:10:41] recognize that signal and that sound and
[1:10:44] what it's supposed to do is it's
[1:10:45] supposed to become so instinctual that
[1:10:48] you know what the sound is and and what
[1:10:50] it means and even more importantly that
[1:10:52] you act upon it
[1:10:55] Saints there was there was a shout there
[1:10:57] was a voice and one day there'll be the
[1:10:59] final sounding of a trumpet amen and we
[1:11:03] are we are living in a time where we are
[1:11:06] to recognize what that sound is we are
[1:11:09] to hear it we don't hear an uncertain
[1:11:12] sound we know what we're hearing amen we
[1:11:15] hear the voice of a message the voice of
[1:11:17] a prophet speaking a message
[1:11:19] amen hallelujah and one day there going
[1:11:21] to be a final sound
[1:11:25] what what happens is you can get so
[1:11:28] caught up in those Affairs in your life
[1:11:31] even though even though the the trumpet
[1:11:34] is sounding you just get so distracted
[1:11:37] you just you miss it all together and
[1:11:38] and I actually took this point out but I
[1:11:40] feel like the Lord's just kind of having
[1:11:41] me bring it in there's also another
[1:11:43] another group that you hear the sound
[1:11:47] but you've just gotten so desensitized
[1:11:49] to it that you do everything you can to
[1:11:51] avoid it amen don't be in either of
[1:11:54] those crack amen when you hear the sound
[1:11:57] when you hear the Lord speaking to your
[1:11:59] heart about something don't be pulled in
[1:12:01] two directions amen you just Just
[1:12:03] Surrender it and if it's something
[1:12:05] that's hard to surrender pray about it
[1:12:07] amen yield it to the Lord because there
[1:12:09] is a desire there there's obviously
[1:12:11] something that's holding you there amen
[1:12:14] but what God can do is he can not only
[1:12:16] take that away from you he can take away
[1:12:17] the desire that's holding you there amen
[1:12:20] I believe that with all my heart
[1:12:25] just I just have two more quotes here
[1:12:27] and then we'll kind of wrap it up and
[1:12:29] Paul was talking about brother benam
[1:12:32] says in in a trumpet gives an uncertain
[1:12:34] sound 1963 and Paul was talking about
[1:12:36] training a man to a sound and just as
[1:12:39] that sound is he knows exactly what to
[1:12:42] do because the bugler has got orders and
[1:12:45] from the chief captain and when he hears
[1:12:47] the sound his the Army knows just
[1:12:49] exactly what to advance and what to
[1:12:51] withdraw by the sounding and
[1:12:55] I read that quote amen we're going to
[1:12:57] this last quote is from return and
[1:12:59] Jubilee brother bandham says now a man
[1:13:01] and this is where the inspiration took
[1:13:03] me when I first heard this where this
[1:13:06] whole sermon came from now a man and his
[1:13:09] family could go back to their original
[1:13:11] inheritance if they could hear the
[1:13:13] Jubilee and a trumpet sound and know
[1:13:17] what it meant to them now if they heard
[1:13:20] the priest sound the trumpet the
[1:13:22] minister of the trumpet is the gospel
[1:13:24] and when they hear it and they know what
[1:13:26] it means catch this and they know that
[1:13:28] that's their inheritance no matter where
[1:13:31] they' lost or how far they went back
[1:13:33] whatever they had to do they had the
[1:13:36] privilege to come and receive again
[1:13:39] their inheritance the whole family could
[1:13:42] come and receive their inheritance
[1:13:44] praise God if they could hear the sound
[1:13:47] of the trumpet and know what it meant no
[1:13:49] matter what you had lost no matter how
[1:13:51] far in sin no matter how far you had
[1:13:54] gone it didn't matter if you knew what
[1:13:57] that sound was and that's an importance
[1:13:59] in training our children and that's the
[1:14:00] importance of reading the word because
[1:14:02] you need to train them to recognize that
[1:14:04] they have an inheritance Hallelujah and
[1:14:07] there's a trumpet sounding and when that
[1:14:09] trumpet sounds they are to take that
[1:14:11] inheritance
[1:14:13] Hallelujah they had the privilege to
[1:14:16] come and receive again their inheritance
[1:14:19] and so it is tonight men and women here
[1:14:21] of Louisiana that knows the things that
[1:14:24] we do know and have heard from our
[1:14:25] brother and different ones of our
[1:14:27] Pentecostal experience of years ago and
[1:14:30] find that we have walled or if we
[1:14:31] haven't walled ourselves from it so far
[1:14:33] we've got to hear what somebody else
[1:14:35] says instead of what thus sayith the
[1:14:37] Lord is and can hear the word of God has
[1:14:40] got to say about it now is the hour of
[1:14:43] Jubilee come back to your original
[1:14:46] inheritance to a real Holy Ghost again
[1:14:51] remember he could go free didn't have to
[1:14:54] pay nothing didn't have to do nothing
[1:14:56] just go up and go that's all he had to
[1:14:58] do go back if he knew the sound of a
[1:15:01] trumpet but saints of God he had to know
[1:15:05] the sound of a trumpet Hallelujah I
[1:15:09] believe that Believers tonight here we
[1:15:11] know the sound of a trumpet I believe
[1:15:14] sometimes we get pulled in two
[1:15:15] directions amen but sometimes we just
[1:15:17] need a little remembrance to come to our
[1:15:19] hearts that I want to become what God
[1:15:21] has intended me to become amen I'm going
[1:15:23] to let the devil know my intentions I'm
[1:15:26] going to I'm going to do these things
[1:15:28] that the scripture tells me to do
[1:15:30] hallelujah
[1:15:33] amen The Trumpet of the Jubilee was to
[1:15:36] sound on what the scripture refers to as
[1:15:39] the day of atonement and this day of
[1:15:43] atonement become a became a day where
[1:15:45] the priests would bring a sin offering
[1:15:47] to sanctify and cleanse and and if you
[1:15:50] go read the scoffield notes on that on
[1:15:52] the day of atonement you know according
[1:15:54] to the the trans ators the significance
[1:15:56] of this day was to make God and the
[1:15:58] sinner at one but all it could do when
[1:16:02] it wasn't a perfect offering back at
[1:16:05] that time in the Old Testament was
[1:16:06] provide a covering but what it did is it
[1:16:09] pointed to Christ amen it pointed to the
[1:16:12] one who could create a perfect offering
[1:16:15] who would be the perfect atonement
[1:16:17] Hallelujah the real atonement the
[1:16:20] acceptable year brother Benham says
[1:16:23] let's just let's stand to our feet
[1:16:24] tonight I just have this last quote and
[1:16:26] going to finish here brother random says
[1:16:28] in the acceptable year as we all know as
[1:16:30] Bible readers was the Year of Jubilee
[1:16:33] that when all slaves and prisoners as
[1:16:35] they were been taken prison and had to
[1:16:38] give a son to pay a debt or a daughter
[1:16:40] to pay a debt and they were in bondage
[1:16:42] no matter how long they had been in
[1:16:44] bondage or how they were supposed to
[1:16:46] stay there when the year come of the
[1:16:48] Jubilee when the trumpet sounded every
[1:16:50] man could go free if he wanted to go
[1:16:52] free you're free you were no more a
[1:16:54] Slave but if you desired to remain a
[1:16:56] slave then you had to be taken down to
[1:16:58] the temple stood by the temple post and
[1:17:01] they took an all and they bored a hole
[1:17:03] in your ear and then you had to serve
[1:17:05] that slave master the rest of your days
[1:17:09] what a perfect example it is of the
[1:17:11] Gospel of Jesus Christ when it's
[1:17:12] preached the acceptable time at the time
[1:17:16] of Jubilee anybody no matter who you are
[1:17:19] it doesn't matter what color or what
[1:17:20] denomination you belong to how far it is
[1:17:22] that you're stooped into sin or what's
[1:17:24] wrong with you you can go free when you
[1:17:27] hear the gospel trumpet sound out you
[1:17:31] are free amen
[1:17:34] hallelujah I'm glad to be free tonight

[1:26:40] the way of faith is that he says not the
[1:26:43] man out here but the man under here and
[1:26:46] he says gets in the way through fears or
[1:26:48] complexes or you know through bitterness
