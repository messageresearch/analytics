Lord just looking Lord for you to do exceedingly AB abundantly Lord more than we can even think or ask Lord we just Commit This service to you Lord we commit everything to you every heart that's here every life Lord we just ask father you'll touch each and every one we pray in Jesus name amen amen turn to very familiar scripture Amen to Mark chapter 16 amen most of us no doubt can quote this scripture by heart amen but I hope it's more than just words on a paper it's something that we take very dear to our hearts amen that because brother Brandon would say it was the last words that fell from the lips of Our Lord amen when somebody gives you their last words it's usually very important amen amen Mark 16 and verse1 15 and he said unto them go ye and into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature and he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them and they shall lay hands upon the sick and they shall recover so then after the Lord had spoken to them he was received up into heaven and sat at the right hand of God and they went forth and preached everywhere and the Lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following amen amen we'll let you be seated we would know this passage of scripture as the last commission or the Great Commission and I I was just looking at this word commission is the act of committing or entrusting a person or group with supervisory power or authority it's a authorative order or charge or direction or it's another one is formally to choose someone to do a special piece of work amen I believe if he's going to choose someone to do a special work he's going to have a special people to do that work amen Jesus said go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature how far all the world who too every creature amen and these signs shall follow them that believe how long all the world who to Every Creature these signs shall follow them in all the world and to Every Creature I believe he was trying to make us understand what that CU he repeated it several times to all the world to Every Creature these signs shall follow them in my name they shall cast out Devils speak with new tongues and they take take up any deadly thing or serpent or drink a deadly thing it will not harm them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover this was his last commission to his church and he said Paul was later ordaining these gifts into the church 30 years later and said in Galatians 1 and8 if an angel from heaven preaches to you any other gospel than this which is already received let him be accursed amen he said so therefore I believe that the Pentecost began without an end he said I believe it is to Every Creature at all times at all places that Pentecost should always remain the Pentecostal blessing upon the people you say well what is the Pentecostal blessing it's the confirmation of the Resurrection it's the confirmation that the same spirit that raised Jesus from the dead will also Quicken our mortal bodies he said no wonder gospel itself means good news good news of what he raised from the dead and because I live ye can live also ye which were once dead in sins and trespasses God has quickened us up together by the spirit that raised Jesus from the dead and we are now sitting in Heavenly places with him communing with him talking with him he said what a joy to tell people that story that believes it to be the truth he said I'm wondering what's happening today are we really getting people people to God or are we really getting them just to church he said we must get them to Christ but where the quickening power lays amen it's good to go to church that's as far as you go in it but it's not far enough when you come to church that's good but go on to Jesus Christ right that is the commission of the church amen is to get people not to a Creed or to a Dogma or to some man's idea or a new religion that's not what this is about it's to get people to Jesus Christ cuz if we haven't got him to Jesus Christ we have utterly failed in our job amen and I believe that there's a people though in this hour that has gotten to more than just a Creed or more than just a Dogma or more than just an idea or more than just a belief system or more than any of that but they have actually realized and understood that the life that was in Jesus amen as it left his body there and it broke out upon the day of Pentecost and is now moving now again in this last day is now quickening Siege once again and it doesn't matter how dark it is how deep you are how far lost you are amen if there's a seed of God on the inside of you that quickening power is going to find you and it's going to bring that quick that seed that's ordained to life he said we must get them to Christ that's good amen it's good to go to church it's good to do those things nothing against that but if you just come to church and you just change from one Church to another one believe system to another that's not what we're trying to do we're trying to get people to a life amen the life of Jesus Christ he said the very essence of this Resurrection is to tell and show and prove that Jesus is raised from the dead he is not dead he lives he lives here he lives in us and if I be with you in you even a little while the world seeth no more yet ye shall see me for I'll be with you even in you and to the end of the world so what was the last commission he gave Mark 16 the last words that fell from our Lord's lips when he commissioned his church how many's part of his church amen this commission did not end with the with the apostles amen it continues all the way down to the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ amen this commission it came from the Lord's lip go into all the world and preach the gospel he that believeth and baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned now remember he may be damned he might have a chance he won't have one Earthly chance no uncertain sound about that if he don't believe he'll be damned all right amen now what kind of sign is going to follow them these signs well on some of them will it follow perhaps it will maybe will these signs shall follow them that believe what signs they will believe in healing they will believe in casting out Devils they will believe in speaking in tongues is I'm not making this up as a direct quote they believe they will believe in all the supernatural works of God the resurrected Jesus Christ working among them is that the truth is that the truth it's God's Last Words then cursed is he that tries to add to or take away from it that's just the way it is hallelujah that's just the way it is so we are under a commission we are under a commission to believe in healing we are under a commission to cast out Devils amen we have been given amen authority over the enemy of God Amen that wants to come and take our our our our children captive or our people captive by sicknesses or sin amen there's a Church of the Living God who's been given a commission to cast him out amen I still believe in a church that does that I still believe in the signs and wonders of almighty God Amen that when somebody comes in with sin in their life there is a power that'll cast it out when sickness comes in there's a power that'll cast it out amen hallelujah that's what I want to speak to you on is our commission but I want to en titled it we are still here the mission is still on Amen I I got this from a thought I I was doing some study on commissions and things and of course our Armed Forces they deal with commissions quite every day but there's an elite group of of our Armed Forces is called the Navy Seals and and I got to studying a lot of that and and and their and their their will and testament and their their mission statements and things and I I thought it was quite interesting because I I believe we're also a people of the seals amen people of the open book amen you know I was reading this one seal he said deprived of support in our environment and the support of our own bodies the only thing propping us up was our belief to accomplish the mission the belief to accomplish the mission he said when the mission seemed impossible it was the strength of our belief that made it possible come on somebody the absence of this belief guarantees failure he said a strong belief in the mission fuels our ability to focus and to put forth effort e and to persist believing allows us to see the goal he said a seals belief is accomplishing the mission it transcend transcends environmental or physical obstacles that threaten to make him fail often we think we're indestructible forever the Optimus even when we're outnumbered and outgun we tend to think we have a chance to make it out alive and be home in time for dinner come on on somebody amen listen our mission is not determined it just has nothing to do with our obstacles that we face or are the circumstances that we face no we have a mission to fulfill amen we have a promise to reach we have a body change to take come on now it doesn't matter what I feel like it or not it has nothing to do with it it doesn't matter if I feel like if I feel like I'm a Christian or if on my worst days I'm a child of God on my best days I'm a Child of God what I'm going through and who I am does not determine who I am or who he [Applause] is amen he says I wouldn't want to die in a cage of starvation amen amen or have my head cut off for some video to be shown around the world on the interet internet my attitude is that if the enemy wants to kill me they're going to have to kill me now our missions are voluntary come on now I can't think of a mission that wasn't ours is an Unwritten code it's better to burn out than fade away that's right I heard the prophet of God say the same thing better to wear out than rust out right amen it's better to burn out than fade away with our Last Breath we we we will take as many of the enemy with us as possible come on Hallelujah I'm not talking about some Navy SEAL now I'm talking about a child of God I thought my if a man could have such a drive in him and so be so so so moved by by what he's been taught and what he's learned amen from a government that's corrupt and and a gr government that does all kinds of things how much more should a child of God have such a passion inside of them to fulfill the commission that's been given in this day amen in my name they shall cast out Devils amen I don't want to die in some cage of starvation and be caged up and caged like a bird brother bradam Saw an Eagle that was caged away when he was destined to be flying in the heavenlies amen listen there's somebody here tonight that has loosen the doors yes yeah you don't have to stay in that cage you don't have to stay in that cage of depression you don't have to stay in that cage of doubt and unbelief you have the rights to walk out of it that's right amen my head ain't going to be on the platter down in Hell's television look who gave up this time look who walked away this time no that's not where I'm going to be no if I die I'm going to die killing as many enemies that I can kill amen you know I I I was actually looking into these things and I ran across a man he's known now as the Lone Survivor and and his name is Marcus Latrell yeah they made a movie out of him wrote books hadn't really looked I hadn't watched that or or read in his books but just read some excerpts of his story and heard him tell it on on YouTube I believe as I was studying this been several years ago but he was a man with three other three other Compadres that were dropped off in Afghanistan and they were under a mission to go take out a certain terrist and and they were looking for him and and they were under surveillance and and they were on the mountains they hiding during the day and going out at night and looking and trying to find this one and and you know uh they came across uh I bumped into some uh goat herders and and they bumped into them and they knew when they did they they they they knew that their position was compromised so they they had wanted to they didn't know what to do they they didn't know if they should take take them out or or they should tie them up or or what they should do so they voted or done come up the leader decided they'd let them go but they knew that they they very well could give away their position and within an hour they were under extreme gunfire and mortar reals and and and and it was actually one of the deadliest days for the seals a and so uh cuz there was others that come in to try to SA sa them and they shot them out of the air but here here they were because they allowed what seemed to be very innocent to live amen you know that little Philistine one day is going to go up to be a big Philistine amen they might look like a peacekeeper or peaceful they might look very Innocent but they don't have your best interest at heart amen and they're very quickly amen was telling where where he was and and they find themselves and he finds himself like after I don't know how many hours of fighting for against the just seemed like hund Talib ban Fighters and three three of them were killed and he's he's laid into a into a tree and he's he's actually bit his tongue in half and he's shot and he's he's paralyzed from the waist down and and I just want to pick up a story as he as as he tells it his nose was broken he was shoved inside of his face he bit half his tongue off and spit it out of his mouth he was paralyzed from the waist down he had crawled into a ravine after hours of fighting and watching the sun go down he thought his life would just fade away he said I was in bad shape I was dying I didn't know what to do I was laying there in this tree looking at the moon he said I begin to feel sorry for myself my brother a Navy SEAL to a twin brother and I was thinking of him and my teammates and all the training we had been through and I laid there and I was like get up and let's go that's what I said what what what was I going to do laying there and die I wasn't going to do that I definitely wasn't going to feel sorry for myself I kept thinking okay I'm alive I'm alive I had men that were beside me they fought and died I'm still alive so the mission is still on all right the mission is still on let's go and so I reached out and I grabbed a rock and I reached out as far as I could and I drew a line in the dirt in front of me and I'm like I'm going to crawl till my feet hit that and if I'm still alive when I get on the other side of that line I'm going to draw a line again and when I did that I drew a line and I crawled to my feet hit it and I fell down a hill and I crawled up another Hill and I drew another line and I did that for seven miles wow and he said somebody was like well why didn't you quit that was not an option Hallelujah that was not an option that's who I am basically I'm not ever going to stop ever period until you take my breath away and you strip everything away that's how I am trained that's how we are trained from the day we go into training they take everything that you are and everything you wanted to be and they mold you back up to what they want you to be I thought that exactly what happens to a child of God you wonder how you still got strength you wonder how you still can go you wonder how you can make another step because he took you and it's not you that liveth but he that liveth on the inside of you maybe some of you find yourself blown apart this this evening you're on the verge of giving up why don't you grab a promise come on come on grab a rock and draw your line and drag your body across it and draw another line let's draw it till we get on the other side cuz we are not quitters we are not quitters we have been given a commission and we will destroy the works of the devil we are still here the mission is still on praise the Lord God didn't God didn't raise us up to be a bunch of wimps right crawl up in our little ball is there a handheld maybe I can grab it amen crawl up in a little ball and and and just give up you know I know we all go through things every one of us had here's the seals Creed I will never quit my nation expects me to be physically harder and mentally stronger than my enemies if knocked down I will get back up every time I will draw on every remaining ounce of strength to protect my teammates and to accomplish our mission I am never out of the fight come on somebody hallelujah amen God has raised us up to be Champions amen just like him Champions God has raised is up to be greater Amen to move in the higher Heights and greater positions and places amen we're not here to be a bunch of sisses that's right we're not here to be just a bunch of Pew occupiers and say yeah you go do it yeah you go to do it no you have been called not to be on a sideline but to be in the fight we are all called to be a part of this battle I don't care what position and called Amen to be in the fight to fight with all you got that ain't just coming to a special meeting and giving a fight on a Wednesday night you're called to fight with all you got on a Sunday morning or prayer meeting you are called not by me not by these men but by almighty God commission to fight with all you got brother Brandon would say it like this he said what we need today is Holy Spirit spunk not no watered down weak back spineless boneless Christian but somebody that stand toe to- Toe with that devil and tell them you don't have a right you've come on my grounds This Is My Land This is my property this is what God give me yes sir come on now there ain't a daddy in here that if you would go home and you would find somebody sitting on your recliner drinking your I te ain't one of you would stand for it you would be willing to fight or you would call somebody who could take care of it the law amen whatever whatever it take you would not allow them to sit there one more moment on what was yours come on somebody am I telling the truth amen not one of us red-blooded American man would sit there and allow somebody to sit in our house and go through our stuff and go through our bedrooms and go through all the thing no sir we would fight but how many times we allow the devil to come into our homes and come into our bedrooms and come into the things that are ordained to be for God in his service and we allow him to sit there kick his feet up we need some holy ho GH spunk some grit get out there and do something about it direct quote I was going to he said a baseball football stadium one day I seen a little thing hanging on the walls always struck me said it's not the size of the dog in the fight it's the size of the fight in the dog yeah it's a good thing a Chihuahua ain't the size of a of a German Shepherd they want none of us have a leg in here amen he's not worried about his size there's some spunk inside of him it ain't the size it ain't how long you've been doing it ain't how great you are ain't got nothing to do with that it's the size that's on the inside of you and it's been deposited by the spirit of God Amen it's it's unlimited power he said if you're a big dog and just a coward you'll get whipped every time but if you got you're just a little puppy and got a lot of grip you can put the enemy running anytime it's a size of God in heaven that's in the heart how big is your god it's the size of God the God in heaven that's in your heart amen amen he's a big God and a good God and covers all space and time he said you know your amens don't hurt me you're shouting and crying don't bother me he said puts me in mind when I used to go hunting I used to like to hunt at night do you ever know that aost hunt do different things he had old dog had about one tooth in his head but brother he had a lot of grit about him he would tackle anything but a skunk and he said when he got under a brush pile like that the only thing I could get him to do go get that skunk was lift up that brush pile and hit him in the back end and say sicking boy sicking boy and he'd get that skunk too he said brother the worst skunk I know of is the devil that's why your pastor needs your amens that's why he needs your Hallelujah and your praise God he needs you in your seat pulling on the word of God saying sick him that's the one that's been tormenting me that's the one that's been after my child get him don't let him get away with that go after that devil you say well you're trying to get us stirred up you're exactly right I'm trying to get you stirred up enough you'll get off your haunches and your credibility of 50 years ago and you'll get some Holy Ghost spunk on the inside of you that'll stand Toe to Toe with that devil and say devil you don't have a right you don't have a right in my body you don't have a right in my children is there some fathers here that'll tell the devil you don't have a right in my children you don't have a right in my home you don't have a right in my life the mission is still on the worst skunk I know of he said he's the stinking thing I ever smelt yeah ain't nothing like a skunk that a stin skunk gets in everything smell gets in everything can't hard to get rid of it you can try all kind of Remedies and it's still staying it's lingering that's the devil but remember this the Christ and the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts in my book of Acts I say healings take place raising the dead take place you say well I see a lot of fussing going on there the book of Acts is the acts of the Holy Ghost that's what that book's about this is what we are to continue is the continuation the spirit of God moving in our lives moving in our churches come on somebody not just moving in this building but moving in this Temple amen moving in our lives not just on a Sunday or a Wednesday but every day of our life amen maybe you've been under a rock maybe you've been blowned apart seem like and you just mangled up from this or that and the other Church trouble whatever it is but I'm I'm hoping that you'll just get enough about you tonight to grab a hold of one promise and draw a line and say devil I'm coming across that line The Book of Revelation shows how that Antichrist Spirit would come into the church and defile it and make it lukewarm formal and Powerless it expose we know this quote it exposes Satan revealing his works the attempted destruction I love hey the attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's word right down to the time he's casting the Lake of Fire he fights that he can't stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of this true church and what she is and what she stands for that she can do the Greater Works she will be an invincible Army she will be an invincible Army hallelujah amen she will be an invincible Army that's what this Navy SE we almost feel indestructible amen because of what has been put inside of them such a belief to believe a Creed of an evil government Amen to do the missions of an evil cment it's what it is an evil cment that Satan controls and they do it with passion they do it with Git they do it they're going to they're not going to fail you have to take the life out of me that's the only way I'm quitting and they do it like that under those those those under that understanding in and here we are on the other side amen a true church with a true commission from the kingdom of almighty God how much more should we fight how much more should we go go with all that we got how much better would our services be if we would come with all we [Applause] got oh yeah I know we got this on our mind and that on her mind and that tomorrow next week and we already in the next month and Christmas is coming don't you know brother Tim amen what about right now there might be a seal in here this evening that's got enough passion inside of them that'll begin to grab a hold of a promise and begin to fight their way towards that devil that's got somebody caged up amen this is their goal this is their Creed I'm going to guard amen my friends I'm going to fight for them I'm not going to give up on them come on now amen I may give up on you these men may give up on you but God's never gave up on [Applause] you he said she will be an invincible army they get the true revelation of the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian church and by God's spirit discern and withstand not just see it but withstand it that means stand up against it that means take a stand Satan will be powerless before her he will be as definitely thwarted or defeated today as when Christ with stood his every effort to gain power of him the desert yes Satan hates Revelation but we love it with true Revelation in our lives the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against us but we will prevail over them that's enough words right there makes me want to go fight cuz I'm I'm I'm fighting a defeated enemy I'm fighting a defeated foe Hallelujah that's who you're fighting he's already been defeated at Calvary amen your healings already been paid for amen it struck me so real last night as I begin to think about healing you know and people say well I don't know if it's the Lord's will if I'm Healed listen they use that for a copout for their unbelief listen the Lord's will is his word and his word says by my stripes you're healed I'm the Lord God that heals all thy [Applause] diseases I love how he does that kind of stuff he makes things very simple he puts high blood pressure cancer sugar diabetes and any kind of rough word however long you want to make it and he puts it in three letters all Amen in other words he don't have to come and do an addition or what I co yeah I do no it's already covered it's already done it's already finished sir I've used this before and I'll use it again but Timothy said in the last days perilous time shall come the last days for who we get all nervous about that and we see it it is the last days it is the last moments of time but it's not my last days no no this is only my beginning but it is the last days for cancer it is the last days for trigar diabetes it is the last days for back trouble it is the last days for depression it is the last days for anxiety it's the last days for the devil your enemy has an expiration date Hallelujah your enemy has a day he is coming to his end but you're not you're Eternal just as God is eternal and while your enemy is burning in the Lake of Fire you're going to be shouting on the Hills of Glory I say let's get the party started this is not my last day this is my beginning I'm just about to step from time into eternity [Applause] Hallelujah your enemy has an expiration date and him knowing that he knows he has such a a short time and still he fights he must believe in what he's doing you know why people give up because they stop believing amen if this man would have stopped believing in his mission he'd been laying dead somewhere and they had to go get him but maybe burn up in the fire I don't know what would have happened to him but there was something that was instilled in him through his training through what he had been through listen God doesn't waste a battle in every battle he is preparing you for the next brother Timothy I don't like hearing that well that's just the way it is we're not Millennium yet there going to be one trial to the next trial to the next trial Hey listen we're not the only ones though that deal with depression and suicide and spirits of every kind the whole world deals with them that's right at least we have a hope at least we have something that we can lean upon in our times of trials in the darkness that comes around us and all we can look up and see a few Stars yet there's something on the inside of us said I'm not giving up I'm not quitting I I hadn't been to church in a while I I've went on the sidelines somewhere but there's something still on the inside of me I can look back and I can say oh my life he's been faithful through church trouble he's been faithful through church splits He's been Faithful though preachers walked away he's still faithful come on somebody though all walk away he's still God [Applause] this is where you got to come to you're going to go through times you're going to go through Wilderness Jesus did he was our commanding officer he would not give you a commission that he would not do himself matter of fact he's been tempted in all things what the Bible says he's went through it all you know this I don't know where this story come from brother Danny where brother Danny steon had told me about it and I hope I can get it as correct as possible because it's very profound it was a man that was dealing with a homosexual spirit and he went to his pastor and he began to talk to him and finally he looked at his Pastor he said he said I look Pastor you can't help me he said I you you ain't never dealt with this you you you don't you know what you don't know what it's like to deal with what I'm going through I I don't know why i' come he said I don't know what to and said the P just kind of bowed his head and didn't really know what to say and he hears a voice speak to him and says you tell him I did he was tempted in all things he went through it all therefore he would not commission you to go something through something that he hadn't already went through and showed it can be defeated showed it can be overcome showed you can rise above it sir Jesus went through church Blitz he had friends walk away from him his own family denied him he went through it all yes sir amen I'm just so broken brother Timothy well if you allow it allow God to use it he can use that Brokenness this is another sermon but I I was just doing some research on on on Brokenness and just and and and studying on ashamed being broken and ashamed and I come across this technique they do in Japan it's called tusuy or something like that not very good in Japanese not very fluent and so that's the English version of what they do but anyway it's a it's a a technique that if you're walking across your kitchen so or somewhere and you got your grandma that's or dish has been passed down through generations beautiful pottery and you got it in your hand and and you're very trying to be very careful because it's been passed down it's worth a lot of money antiques you know whatever and you stumble against something that falls out of your hand and crashes into pieces you know they don't go take that pottery and sweep it all up and throw it in the trash a lot of us do that we've done that many times you know well I can't do none of that broke but they actually take that and they gather up all those pieces and they begin to put that Pottery together you know what they use by the Jason they use gold and they take gold and they line this cracks of this vessel and actually they say Amen the value is greater now than it was before because of the gold that's placed on them cracks and it's now a beautiful vessel and it's one of a kind you can't get another one like it come on somebody we're all one of a kind we can't get another one like you why do you think Jesus has tried over and over and He Didn't Throw the Clay Away but he just picked it up and he molded cuz he can't get another one like you and he's Desy brought you here for a purpose to fulfill something amen and to and to be somebody listen we ain't all white we ain't all black we ain't all whatever color we ain't all kind of we're all different God made us this [Applause] way come on now amen God knows how to mold the pottery and he don't look at you as a broken peace he looks at you as a possibility of his Amazing Grace and he reaches down and he picks you up and he puts in those cracks and those knocked out spots in your heart and he puts deity there come on somebody does anybody know about the love of [Music] Jesus does anybody know about the grace of Jesus Amen this is what it is brother Jason he takes these pieces they ain't all broken the same amen you can take the very same bowl and drop it two of them just alike same color same everything and they all break in different places cuz they have different places of weaknesses amen but God doesn't take you and decide okay I'm done throw him in the trash pile no he picks it up I got to share this one right here while we're on this Pottery brother Matt Morris was just at our church and he was ministering over there in India and and he was they was going down to the river to baptize some people and he was sitting on the bank there as they was as they went down he's looking around there's all this pottery and he sees one piece that was that was that was still pretty much all there and he said that'd be kind of nice to take home they throw it away he said I'll just take it home and the brother's like oh no brother don't do that said those those things were one time they were there were dishes that they used to worship idols and he got to looking at that piece of pottery and looking at that water looking at that piece of pottery and look in that water he said do you not realize what is taking place here we're taking vessels down in that water that once were vessels of idolatry once served a dead God but they're going to be buried in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ to be raised up in the resurrected power he said this is a sign that God can take what's wrong and what's tore up and what's messed up and what's thrown in the Heap pile and bring it out of there and make it a vessel of [Applause] honor to God Jesus was led up by the spirit in the wilderness to be tempted of the devil when it fasted 40 days and 40 nights and the tempter came to him this is Matthew 4 and: three said if thou be the Son of God if thou be command these stones to be made to bread and he answered and said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God then the devil take him up the holy city set him on the Pinnacle of the temple and say to them if thou notice all the questions yes the devil likes to throw up a lot of questions if thou be if you're really an overcomer if this Jesus said Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God the devil take him up to exceeding high mountain and showeth them all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them and say to them all these things will I give to thee if if thou wil Fall Down and Worship me and Jesus said get thee hence Satan for it is written Thou shalt Worship the Lord thy God and him only sh shall thou serve see he see the word of God will defeat Satan anywhere anywhere Jesus said all of his fine qualities the father had given to me but he's he with all those fine qualities he said it is written when he met Satan he defeated him right there on the word of God God brought it down to a place that anybody the weakest of Christians the weakest of Christians can defeat Satan on the word of God you will not defeat him on your feelings you will not defeat him on your circumstances you will not defeat him in the things around you but you can defeat him if you stand on the word amen so if we have to have a word to stand on it's got to be a word that never fails because if it's a word that fails you can't stand on something that's shaking and moving and it's got to be a firm foundation so God gives us a word and he keeps his word no matter how unreasonable it may seem to a people God will always keep his word hallelujah that's why if you got children that are lost you need to put that word before you they shall be there and their offspring with them the promises unto you and your children that's how you defeat him when he comes if if they were really Sons or if they were really daughters they wouldn't be out there well if you they weren why are you so worried about them devil amen why are you worrying me about them if you think they're that's not who they are but you know there's got to be something on the inside and the devil gets nervous cuz he knows his time is short he's only got just a certain time he can keep your children come on now he's only got a certain time he can keep you in the place that you are but there's a word for your deliverance and there's a spirit that'll follow that word and break the chains off of [Applause] lives Hallelujah God's word is infinite he knows all the future from the beginning and he doesn't make a promise L he knows it's going to happen Hallelujah I love a word like that my word may fail your word may fail but his word never has failed not one time not one time is it failed he said you know how strange that people might have thought of in the days of Noah when he was building away at the ark to save himself and his household there's going to be rain come down of Heavens but it didn't matter matter what they thought God reigned it just the same they had scientific proof they had it had never Noah what are you doing well I'm building Arc for what it's going to rain rain what is that what is it's going to fall from the heavens and it's going to come up from the earth and he's going to flood this place no you done lost your mind we got instruments we sent up there and there's no rain there never has been let me look back since the beginning of time what God Said is going to rain so he just kept putting another nail in the ark listen critics are going to critic unbelievers are going to unbelieve no matter how much you try to argue with them no matter how much you try to show them that's who they are but a Believer he's going to believe it's who we are we have a belief in our commission therefore we going to fulfill it and if a devil happens to step up and our way we're going to cast him out and if sickness Ares we're going to lay hands on it and it's going to go cuz it's his word and I can stand on his word he says I think about Moses standing up there on the side of the mountain looking at that burning bush he had lost all hopes of Freedom listen to this he had lost all hopes of Freedom this seem like the freedom that the people he so Gallant stood for one time was ever going to happen been 40 years since he tried but in the light of God standing by that burning bush everything in him changed Hallelujah he said I think it's the same today that many of us lose the sight of freedom I think as a little boy sitting here maybe INF infant uh infantile paralysis little arms twisted up lady with a white can maybe a blind woman lovely young lady on the C maybe cancer heart trouble or diseases maybe it's going to kill you you lose all thoughts of Freedom as soon as a doctor says it's incurable but let me say this with God there's not no such a thing as an incurable disease it doesn't matter what the doctor say it doesn't matter what monitors say it doesn't matter what test say it only matters what God says he said that's the reason he said I think men and women today would would they would ever step into the light of the Holy Spirit and under the unction of God's spirit the light of God's word everything that God promised will illuminate to you and be real again again be real again amen Maybe we've lost the realness step into the light of his word and let it become real again he said I I that's the reason Moses failed in the first place here's what's the matter it was the lack of having what the burning bush had amen what our failure today is the lack of having what the Holy Spirit has the Holy Spirit has all good things for us there he goes again all all good things for us and if we receive the Holy Spirit then all somebody say all all things are possible not only possible but promt my God Jesus said ask the father anything in my name and I will do it if you abide in me and my words abide in you ask what you will and it'll be given to you see when we step into the light of God's word with the unction of the Holy Spirit to shine a light on it brother The Impossible becomes a little thing then hallelujah amen I love how God magnifies things he makes what we think big into little things come on sometimes you needed to change your perspective get up a little higher amen I remember when I first went to South Africa I was walking down them streets and them big tall buildings I thought wow this is amazing you know I'm a city boy we tall his thing we got a pine tree or a country boy tallest thing I got a pine tree it's pretty tall but it ain't nothing like them skyscrapers thought wow this is amazing next day I'm up on top of one of them eating dinner and I'm looking down like wow them people look little the next day I was up on Table Rock and I was looking down on that on that restaurant down on the city and you could barely make out where I was standing just see little little little things walking around and a few more days later I was in an airplane and I went over Table Rock and I looked down and Table Rock look small see what you're looking at depends on where you're at what you're really seeing depends on what you're at if you're in the world the things of the devil looks huge it looks impossible it looks like I'll never overcome but if you get in the light of God's word you'll realize it's a little thing amen it's a little thing to overcome smoking and drinking and drugs it's a little thing in the presence of almighty God I've seen him in a moment take it all [Applause] away and getting a astronaut getting a rocket things really begin to look small this big old world and all our worries and all our frustration ain't a person sitting on top of a rocket worried about anything that's going on in this world I got to thinking about that when we was in the middle of 2020 and Co and then we got all the riots that were happening in the middle of that they shot a rock it off I thought I bet them two guys sitting on there they ain't worried about Co they ain't worried ain't looking over I wonder what they're doing over there in Minneapolis or wherever what riding and this at Chicago New York's whatever I no their eyes was on something different their position had changed maybe the day before they was reading all about it but today they're looking to go into another atmosphere all right maybe before these meetings you was reading all about it you thought it was impossible to overcome that thing you thought it was impossible to ever see your family serving God but maybe you got on the top of a rocket and you started looking up look up your Redemption draw now and you started looking into another realm and what was big becomes a little thing God God asked us to believe his word therefore he sends his holy spirit to energize that word when he falls into it he said when the word's being preached and the Holy Spirit brings the word he energizes that and flashes the same light of God's blessed promise God said I have remembered my promise to Abraham Isaac and Jacob and I'm sending you down there to do it and when God's word and promise becomes enlightened by the presence of the Angel of the Lord Stop Moses now if you can oh my yeah he's on his road cuz God always keeps his promises yes sir I thought this pretty amazing last night brother Jason ended this on on the on the Arrow of God's Deliverance it was a king that was given a commission strike the ground amen he told to shoot a bow and he was told to strike a ground and we know what he did he just took little three little laxidasical hits at it and he quit that was as far as he could go with what he believed God could do some people in strike the ground till they get to justification and as far as they go sanctification that's as far as they go but listen God wants to take us all the way amen we strike the ground enough to get our healing or or get a little Deliverance but we still live with other things and we allow Satan to bombard our mind and bombard our houses and bombard our children he wants you to take the arrow of God's Deliverance and going to strik in that ground until your enemy is gone if I can get somebody here tonight to believe the commission enough to grab an [Applause] arrow devil I have had enough of you you have come on my territory one too many days one too many moments and I am here to take your head [Applause] off yeah that's a sermon right there preached me and brother Tim went in there to pray for a woman that had cancer in her body and the doctors were taking her the next morning or maybe that day to to have operation and dad asked her she's laying there in that cancer riddle body and said what do you want me to do sister she said I want you to cut his head off I pray for me brother Tim that I'll just get the feeling better and my emotions will get all right and this a cut his head off so we did what she said we took the sword of the word the commission that God gave us and we laid hands upon the sick and they shall recover and that cancer ain't a sickness is a devil it's a name that the that the doctors give to it but we know what the eagle said he said it's a spirit and it come in that body in a body that was given unto God and it wasn't his possession to begin with Hallelujah we took our commission seriously and we prayed the prayer of faith and she went into the operation room they opened her up they said there ain't no cancer here hallelujah he's still the same yesterday today and forever he's still the same God he's still the same one right now you've heard the story probably watched the video but sister Atlanta buts that's a warrior might have been about a 90 lb Warrior but she was a warrior nonetheless she would come to church didn't matter what her feelings listen she' put a lot of us well people to shame we make up all kind of I'm going to be real tonight I we may we make all kind of excuses not to be in the house of God when the commission is is to be there it's part of the commission to the church well all right yeah I don't you don't get popular being like I ain't interested being popular I'm interested in preaching God's word I'm interested in getting somebody saved I'm interested in taking my sword and cutting off lukewarmness and formalism and Powerless religion I'm sick and tired tired of it amen I believe we ought to be a people that knows Our God and does exploits it's not afraid to stand toe to- Toe with the devil and say take your hands off you've come and you defied the armies of the Living God but today is your day of defeat is our commission this little woman was coming to church she didn't care she'd have can canc Cancer Treatments same week be there be on the couch could of hard to get herself up I got to get to church drag her little 90 lb shriveled up body the doctors thought the cancer treatment itself was going to kill her brought her in there and we put her up in the back and isolated her with her family but on one Sunday morning oh Jesus I'll never forget that moment Amen brother Tim was preaching that Bible days are here again we're serving a Bible God that has a Bible word that has Bible signs and wonders amen it's not a day gone by a god a God that we can just testify about a God that we can just talk about but a God that we can know a God that answers our prayers and he's preaching that thought as he even spoke about some of it just a few this other night but here he is he begins to sing a song what have I to dread what have I to fear here leaning on the Everlasting Arms that word struck that little 90 lb woman she said I don't have to fear this out of her seat she come and she made about two laps around that building and as she come prophecy went forth and said maram your enemy's dead Hallelujah you said what about it what happened I tell you what happened she went to the doctor the next day and she goes and gets her pets can and they come back all clear Hallelujah I'm here to tell you we're in that same kind of service tonight amen you can walk in here all battle down and all bound town and your scan looks all dark and dim but you can come out the next side all clear all is well it's finished it's over with we're still here the mission's still on Amen we're not to cow down so what about this one that died that's not has nothing to do with it the mission's still on I'll just tell you a personal testimony just a few years ago passing of my mother in 2021 I was to go right before she passed away I was to go to brother Ron Spencer's a minister for him and then the next weekend be at brother Josh Bennett for their meetings and it was in between was me and my wife's 25th anniversary amen thankful for a good wife amen thankful she could be with us sister Katie sister Katie's at home tonight just out feeling well in her body just believing the Lord's healing her even now but here just at a real Touch and Go place and she's in and out of the hospital and she's on a seemed like we didn't realize at the time but she was on a very fast decline of course holding Faith preaching Faith circumstances doesn't matter it doesn't matter who's wilting down or who's going away or who's walking away that has nothing to do with it I have a commission and I'm going to fulfill it I don't care as they say a hair lips a devil I could care less knocks all of his teeth look a good deal we are going to finish thisen so I I was praying about it what I what I do you know and watching looking and talk with brother Tim he said but he said son we are at a Red Sea moment he said I believe we need to speak and go forward he said you need to go to brother rods and you go to those meetings and God had take care of things and he did amen matter of fact I never forget the week I was leaving I went to go see her in the hospital and she she didn't know anybody really well she knew people she didn't know the day she didn't know it was Tuesday and she didn't know what day it was she knew her birthday and me and Dad but thought she was at home in the hospital room she was trying to go into places is was thought it was her house and I'm just being very real right now amen and and and and so we I go to sit with her and talk with her cuz I want to see her hoping she'll get out of the hospital before I leave and and uh I I just began to sing to her begin to sing songs just cuz she was real uptight and nervous and she knew something wasn't right but she didn't know what you could tell her spirit was just tore up so I remember what David would do he would just sing so I began to sing and I I'd sing Oh only believe and she would sing along with me oh and lift her hand and they say you know it just settle right down and you could see her almost just come to herself and then we then we stop for a minute just come all over again I just begin to sing again about the second of song long or so she she looks at me and she said are you preaching tomorrow night she didn't know what day it was as far as I knew saides ma'am I am she said I'm going to be there so well praise the Lord did look like it did it didn't look like it was no way she was going to be there the next morning they dismissed her and she shows up at church she loved to go to church and she was a Godly woman and and and stilled a lot of Godly principles in US children but you know I I I thought well surely you know God's moving you you're looking for every sign you're looking for everything you're you know you're just you're believing you're pushing it out you just keep going forward so she had to go back in the next morning as we flew out just for some tests and they didn't find anything let her go and so I go to brother Ron's and and I'm just praying and just asking God God be merciful you and it just burden and I'm just God I need an answer I I want an answer I I know you answer and I begin to study on a God that answers and I begin to see what brother brand said God always always answers he said many times it's in an unexpected way at an unexpected time and an unexpected place he said but you just need to realize that when he speaks he answers may not be what you expect may not be what you're looking for but he answers so I get up that that Sunday morning and I begin to preach that thought on the god at answers and I'm here looking for an answer and I'm praying for an answer and I'm asking God God I need to see you visibly I need to know I I need to know that you're here and you're see you're moving in this situation so brother Ron has a a little pull pit part or platform part that goes out in front of his his pull pit and I walk out there for some time and I'm preaching and I'm just going I went off my text and by and at that time my iPad it went blank and and you know and turned off and and I just preaching and I'm telling about the three Hebrew children and how they come to the fire and up and he said brother BR said let's turn towards heaven and he said I look up there and the angel say God are you seeing what's going on he said yeah I see it and he begins this Angel comes up and I'm I'm just going very fast here but this Angel comes up that angel comes up he

have that on didn't have one and I'm preaching and all of a sudden as I'm speaking of him I said he has come down into the fire and when I said that I Heard a Voice begin to speak now sitting behind me with brother Ron Brother Andrew and they saw my iPad pop up they saw it go through all the all through the apps and pick up amen where the where the tapes were and move down and pick a tape and push play you you can argue with it how you want to that's what happened out of the mouth of two or three Witnesses and they witnessed that take place and at that moment brother Ron bumps and he said the angel of the Lord standing right there at the pull pit and I hear Brother bram's voice he said it's the favorite of all the hym he said my favorite of all the hymns he said because it expresses the extreme deity of the Lord Jesus Christ is especially in the day that we're living in he said everybody else wants to make him just a man but he was more than a man he was God and that voice booms out all the way out into the audience to where sisters in the vesu thought they put it on the speakers it's just playing out of my iPad and I thought God you're in the fire yeah yeah you've showed yourself you're answered and and I'm just believing God's going to move I go on to brother Josh's and and I go on the next week home after I preach that meeting brother Josh say I land in streetport

said it's okay to ask why but I'm asking why and as I'm speaking that I was like Lord I I thought you showed very clearly you was in the fire and as I said that a voice spoke to me said I wanted to show you I was in the fire with you he said she's okay but I'm with you and he spoke these words said I'm going to give you a new song to sing and I begin to look at that and I thought here I'm singing the song of morning and my I've lost my mom but I'm not always going to sing this song Come On brother I'm not always going to sing the song of being down and defeated and and and depressed but he's going to give me a new song to sing and I begin to run it through the scriptures and bring it all the way down to Revelations 5 listen he has given the Bride of Jesus Christ a new song to sing hallelujah it's the song of the lamb and he is alive he is Among Us and he's in the fire with [Applause] us I'll show you just how plainly he proved that to me I would fly home and I would go into the hospital room where she was she hadn't spoken a word in 18 hours or so 18 24 hours and hadn't said nothing to a doctor and nothing to anybody I walk in there with me and my dad and we talk

head's coming [Applause] off come on now do you love him more than your backslid condition do you love him more than that lukewarmness is want to shrink you like a Bo constrictor as we heard and suck the life out of you do you love him more than your makeup do you love him more more than your dress do you love him more than your stinking rotten [Music] attitude come on somebody do you love him more than what you have before you I got to study in by by airplanes any well we're bringing this on down or bringing it on up however you want to look at it I got to studying about airplanes you know that when they adjust their different things the wings and the flaps and the Rudders and this that you know you know what that's called it's called adjusting the plane's attitude and you know what happens to a plane when adjust his attitude it adjust his attitude to go higher Hallelujah some of y'all need an attitude adjustment your attitude needs to be adjusted about the church your attitude needs to be come on now your attitude needs to be adjusted about the preaching and the worship and the songs and this that and the other we need our attitudes adjusted cuz we need to go higher this bride is not descending down into Hell she's rising up Hallelujah I'm speaking to a people that's rising up rising in power rising in [Applause] Authority rising and thus sayeth the [Applause] Lord he says we're in a time of of a matching time people want to match this well these are wearing this so I need to wear that hey I'll just be honest with you we got a lady down there and all y'all most of y'all know her cuz I know down there in Waco Texas and she begin to put out a TV show and it changed transformed millions of houses and she didn't have to touch one of them but because of what she was projecting she had reached in M oh oh God she had reached into another real and she was drawing energy and power from that realm and it was drawing people back to her we actually got a lady right now in men Louisiana that's doing the same thing she's now moving into television and things and and all of that what is it she has found that what's around her is not all the power there's more that she can't see than she can see oh yeah I'm going to preach that right there amen that she can gather so much re re doing so much resources and it's limited by this 15,000 people and maybe 100,000 around her but she's realized if I can just get into the other realm there's others there that I can reach I can't see them I don't know them I've never met them but I can reach them and pull from them the power to obtain what I need oh Hallelujah that's exactly that Satan is nothing but a copycat that's exactly what we should be doing pulling not from the Rams around us does you pull Too Much from the realm around you you'll dress like them you'll act like them you'll look like them hey I know it ain't it ain't popular to preach against makeup anymore but it's still wrong it ain't popular to preach against cutting hair but it's still wrong God doesn't [Applause] change and it ain't just for the Sisters there's a godliness that needs to be about our boys too amen I know we want to harp harp harp harp why you dress so long do this so much and our boys look walk around looking like a bunch of homosexuals it's time we clean up it's time we have a house cleaning and saying devil I've had enough of you if you want to match something match your experience against Paul's if you want want to match something it's matching time with the grace of God in the Bible that's our example real matching time don't try to match your neighbor match some of the Saints of the Bible come on now yes sir that's some of the Saints in the Bible so if you're a saint act like one dress like one talk like one pray like it's a direct quote like a saint be like a saint live like a saint die like a saint and go to heaven like a saint sounds like a good deal to me amen but you know we're in a separating time it's a borderline believer halfway look warm the devil don't mind if you're in the church he just don't want you to be the church huge difference he don't mind if you sit on a Pew he just don't want you to be involved and take authority over his kingdom that's what we've been given we've been given a commission it's a direct Authority he said you know it say he said Le to see in church age that's what we're in right he said you'll be just lukewarm said it makes God sick at his stomach he said he spew you out from his mouth the layot of sins just enough religion to make you sick go back to the spirit that works in the framework of the church what church was he talking about this church the Bride of Jesus Christ I know we want to separate it out when the hus pulled away but it's still pulling away borderline believing only going so far preach what you want to just don't mess with my closet preach what you want to just don't mess with my telephone don't mess with the things I'm looking at don't don't don't mess with that preach is happy all right amen the way to get happy is to get saved the way to get saved is to get down on your knees and repent and say God I'm sorry for the law lousy life I've been living and I've been laying under a rock somewhere I want more than I had yesterday amen is there some real Christians even tonight maybe you're even filled with the Holy Ghost but there ought to be a desire I want more than I had yesterday so I'm going to draw me a line in the sand and I'm going to pull myself across it and if I'm still alive when I get on the other side I'm going to draw another line I'm going to keep seeing lines drawn to all my children's in I'm going to see lines drawn to Cancer's heill I want to see lines drawn to people are filled with the Holy Ghost come on let's draw some lines here it's joy unspeakable and full of Glory how the old saints of God used to sit around and sing the Redemption Song Sing of the blood and the power of God and today it's as cold as zero listen he's actually preaching this on the fairgrounds before they had moved into Life Tabernacle but in streetport Louisiana this was the church he actually says here it's one of his favorite places to preach he would preach there I don't know how many Thanksgiving Services you know they just put out and he begins to call them out and tell them where they're wrong I know I'd love to be in brother Brandon's meeting some of you wouldn't cuz some of you get your hide burned I know Hib burning sermons ain't popular no more and we want to we want to you know just a it's a preacher who tell us all the good things listen the good thing is you're going to miss hell Amen brother Tim said it like this and I thought it was really good he said this world will be as close to Heaven some people will ever get but this world will also be as close to hell as I ever [Applause] get that's good news right there if this is the close to hell as I get glory to God hallelujah because this is not my home I'm just passing through I'm a stranger and a pilgrim [Applause] here stranger and a pilgrim what does that mean well go to some land that ain't American and find out you'll find out really quick you're strange you walk like an American you talk like an American somewhere between here and over there I picked up an ACC sent can't speak the language don't look like them don't dress like them don't act like them don't eat like them I ain't like them cuz that's not who I am then how are we going to be dressing like Leo Deans acting like leoan being like living like Leo Dean but yet the Bride of Jesus Christ no that is not going to happen the Bride of Jesus Christ will in no wise be a lukewarm Lord is L to sin but she will be on fire with the fire of God yes yes sir so if you find yourself in that condition you don't have to stay there Hallelujah that's good news amen I found myself in foreign lands many times and I found out real quick I don't have to stay here I got me a ticket home and I got a passport with my picture on it I got a ticket that the price has already been paid and I am going now I'm dependent on a plane and a company that may delay and may cancel and I may have to fight my way home amen but I that's not the that's not the carrier we're looking at this Old Ship is z it'll Crest every wave Hallelujah the waves has been against this ship it's been battered it's been torn but she's going to Crest every one of them Hallelujah and if you got your ticket in your hand you can Rejoice right now and say thank God the way is paid I don't have to stay here this is not my home I'm passing through abely some of us need to strike the ground more strike the ground to our attitudes change you know it ain't all about striking the ground well I wish God save that person no God saved me for you to sa that shows very fact you need to be Sav amen anyhow preach it amen thank you let me go on down as we bring this down no matter how little you are how big you are how important you are how unimportant is direct quote how unimportant you are you are here to serve a purpose just as my finger is here for a purpose the nail of fingers for a purpose my eye and every part of our bodies is to serve a purpose seen or unseen yes am some of them unseen parts are way more important than the seen Parts prayer warriors are very important for a church amen people that say are supporting is very important you may not ever be on the camera Lord knows I don't want to be on the camera don't understand anybody who does want to be on the camera but the Unseen parts are very very important even things that the doctors don't even know are important you got parts of your body they can cut out and you can still live but God put it there for a purpose they may not know the purpose they may not understand the purpose but God didn't put it there just to see if he could put it there neither did he put you here just to see if he could put you here amen he put you here for a purpose amen and so if you know that you're here for a purpose then there is nothing that can destroy us until God's purpose is fulfilled nothing can harm us into that purpose that God has put us here has been made manifest no matter how much trouble we have how many heartaches Sorrows whatever we go through all of those are for reasons there is a reason for it amen yes but it's all for a purpose all powers of Hell might raise against it but this bride will prevail we have God's Eternal promise oh there may be isms rise there may be programs rise there may be all kinds of things rise looks like it's going to be destroyed but it'll never be destroyed it's the purpose of God to see that it will be that it will prevail then it's not up to me it's not up to you whether to be destroyed or not it's up to God we can rest assured on it God will never let our heritage be destroyed Hallelujah for it is his purpose to give it to us Hallelujah let's bow our heads stand to our feet and bow our heads if you would we were all put here for a purpose every one of us Hallelujah he said I tell you we got to fight but we might have the most powerful weapon the devil makes fun of it and says there's no such a thing but pick up tonight and receive the Holy Ghost and defeat every devil of sin drunkenness whatever it is we got him on the run to be conquered yes and someday that Chief Captain will come and sin and sickness and sorrow will be over with and then we can lay our Shields down then we can lay our swords down then we can say it is finished but until that day pick your sword up you read about it in the book of Nehemiah when they went to rebuild the walls he said for every man to have a pickup a stone in one hand and a sword in the other hand cuz sand ballad and the man that was with him was coming in telling them they couldn't do it and they couldn't be that and they couldn't have it but each man began to work on the wall that was in front of his house the wall was not to keep you it's not there to keep you from something it's to keep you from the enemy from you brother Donnie says it so beautifully he says says I don't look at this message as some wall that holds me in he said I look at as as my castle yes our protection this word that preaches a a a clothline religion is not to keep you from you know looking pretty or being something no it's for your protection yes yes get the bitterness out of your heart amen I believe he's here very powerfully right now he's here to touch hearts and lives I tell you what what I want you to do I want you just wherever you are each one of you to lay hands on one another and I'm reading the quote again so you can see that it's not me it's not William brandom it's not me it's the Lord Jesus Christ and that you will know you're just as effective did you hear that church you're just as effective because you are a Believer and if you feel the holy spirit is on you maybe not in a gift like this but the holy spirit's on you somebody someone no matter who it is lay hands on somebody then bow your head lay your hands on somebody and by your head I feel led to do this I feel it's your time for healing I feel it's your time for deliverance I believe the holy spirit is moving all over this audience Hallelujah he say there little Yonder there's a little fell Yonder from Georg are praying there sitting back there have faith believe it's just everywhere it's just everywhere don't pray for yourself you pray for the person you got your hands on that'll make every one of you praying for one another now Lord Jesus the Son of God who raised from the dead even the threats of Pontius pilot and the Roman government seal could not hold you in the grave God the almighty came down on the day of Easter and rolled back the stone and he broke the seal and he rose up and was with your disciples 40 days and you commissioned them to go into the world and do the

you are to put him in his place and just remind him you know I I remember brother how Howard Carol used to say well the devil would get on him really really hard and things would just be you know knocking left and right and brother Harold would just say all right Satan all it's all right this is your day my day is coming my day is coming Hallelujah I believe he's got an expiration date amen you know the Apostle John said in 1 John 2:15 love not the world neither the things that are in the world If any man love the world the love of the father is not in him you know Satan does a lot of things to hinder our love of God that's right yeah entices us brings all kinds of things not just to young people to old people that's right to lure your away to get in the way of that love relationship because in that love that's the greatest power on all on all the Earth that's what brother brandham said was his great secret to the supernatural that that Power of Love That Power to trust God you know something that the Lord has just made so real to me recently and we realize that you know I mean you can you can take first John 2:15 and apply it to every age oh yes it's that's always been true but the Apostle Paul when he writes to se to to Timothy in his second letter in that third chapter he starts talking about in the last days perilous times will come and Brother brandham Talks so so much in Satan's Eden God of this evil age and he's proving by the Bible that that day that Paul was talking about where Satan would be worship like God would be the day that we live in that this is perilous times not that they didn't have perilous times in every age but there would come a time where it would be so bad where Satan would be exalted as the god of the Earth and it would actually become his Eden are we here I'm going tell you something friends that's that's one of the last things to see the whole world brother Brown said go on in saying Satan worship and that's when the Lord perfects his bride I love the power of God I think about someday brother Tim on that on that great day when when we're seated there with Christ on the throne and Satan is brought forward for his judgment and the Bible says they shall narrowly look upon him say is this the man that's right that made Nations tremble you got to be kidding we fell for this and you know I just imagine I mean you you can take it or leave it I just for me in my mind's eye I don't think the Lord will let him get by so easily as to step forward and say Satan I gave you everything I gave you the churches the families the schools I gave you science and ucation I gave you technology I gave you finances I allowed you to become the god of the age and when you were at your Zenith I perfected this queen that you see with me I perfected her right under your nose oh what a victory friends the Apostle Paul warned that one of the things that would be very prominent is that people people would be traitors they would be heady they would be highminded and catch it they would be lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God I said to myself I heard I don't remember who now was one of our preaching me Ministry team members who was ministering might have been brother Matt recently and he's quoting that scripture and I said Lord don't ever let me be guilty of loving me more than I love you don't ever let me satisfy this rotten old flesh when the enemy comes in to Temp me say I am not going to love me more than I love him oh that's what the world does they're going to love theirselves they would be the Bible says they would be lovers of theirselves truce Breakers false accusers say Lord don't ever let me be a lover of me more than a lover of you how many say Lord I wanted this flesh so crucified why you know why don't you listen friends do you know that that when when when something reaches an expiration date I mean you you know they'll they'll come around and that guy's got that stamp and he he's setting the date he puts a stamp on there and sets it on the shelf and it's got that expiration date you know why don't you take your eyes of Faith tonight and take the expiration and set it for tonight and say Satan you're expired I'm not even going to give you till tomorrow you're expired tonight how many are willing to have him expired say I'm done with you I'm not going to be a lover of myself anymore I'm going to serve the Lord God oh brother Matt let's sing again my chains are gone I've been set free have you expired him why don't you give him an expiration date put in capital letters expired my chains are gone I've been set free my God My Savior ransomed me and like a flood his Mercy Reigns unending love no expiration date Amazing Grace oh together my chains my

World Order not here to be part of that perilous time I'm here to escape it oh God lord I pray tonight that every claim that was made in the name of Jesus Christ it'll be recorded in heaven and
