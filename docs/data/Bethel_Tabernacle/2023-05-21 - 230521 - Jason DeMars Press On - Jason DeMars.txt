when the when the valley is deep forget the next part when your body is weary when we when we spent our resources what do we do we give up we quit say I ran out of resource I can't go on no because we're serving the god whose resources are unlimited we say I'll press on even when all odds are against me it looks impossible I'm going forward with Christ amen let's pray father we we come to you Lord and we're so thankful I'm so thankful Lord that you have given us the holy spirit that you've given us your word the revelation of that word Lord a true understanding and more sealed into this Holy Spirit Lord this Holy Spirit revelation that's leading us and guiding us into all truth that's teaching us Lord and correcting us and convicting us and strengthening us Lord we look to you we ask that you would As We Gather that you would do those things which are needful in US Lord move by your Holy Spirit speak to Hearts Grant strength Grant Deliverance Grant healing we Look to You Lord you sent your word in healness Lord we're we want to have Gentile faith Lord we want to just look straight at your word and regardless of circumstances say I believe it I accept that it's mine we ask that your Holy Spirit would come and take each one of us out of the way that you would flow and you would use this as you'd see fit we commit ourselves to you in Jesus name amen while I have you standing we'll read our text in Hebrews chapter 12. if you want to bring up the PowerPoint brother Mark appreciate that I'm going to read the first two verses there wherefore seeing we also are compassed about was so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus the author and finisher or perfector of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the Throne of God may the Lord add the blessing to the reading of his word he can be seated I just want to ask everyone to remember me in prayer I'll be leaving tomorrow out of Savannah for a mission's trip to the Middle East I'll be gone for two weeks so prayer for myself traveling mercies and that the Lord would have his way and the services and in meetings and Ministry there and he would open new doors um also please remember Sister Amy and the girls in prayer as well so two two weeks is uh when you're going into it looks like a long time it goes by fast when you're in it but but um and busy but we we just need the Lord's strength I'll be going to Turkey and also to Israel to minister to the word Minister the word to them there so prayers appreciated um we're running a race that's what Paul Likens the Christian walk to here in Hebrews this is what we're talking about we're not literally running a race it's a metaphor for your walk with God it is a it is a race there is a prize there is a goal there's there's a Mark that we're going towards and there's a way to go about this and this is the pitfalls that the Christian world ends up in all the time is they try to go after God and pursue this race according to their own way of thinking and own way of doing things we're not to do that were to lean not to our own understanding but in all our ways acknowledge Him and he'll direct our paths you know and so we look at this whole whole picture of the Christian walk and it can't be based on our own thinking it isn't going through the seven sacraments of the Roman Catholic Church that we run the Christian race it isn't by attending church regularly that's that's fine much of the world does that it doesn't doesn't mean you're saved it doesn't mean you have the Holy Ghost it doesn't mean you're following the word in your life it just means you go to a building and you attend a place it isn't looking the part it doesn't look like you look the part it isn't trying to fit in with the people around you or just do what the other people are doing but what it is a completely different thing it is a race that we are running and we have to do it according to the way God calls us to do it what is what does he say looking unto Jesus not looking under the church not looking unto the fivefold ministry though we thank the Lord for that and Jesus puts himself on display through that but that's not what it says here it says looking unto Jesus looking unto the word men will fail men will make mistakes men will disappoint you even if they did nothing wrong they might disappoint you anyway because your expectations are wrong and so we're not to look to men to meet our needs or look to Jesus he's our example now each of us is to live as an example and to not put a stumbling block in front of other people but ultimately we're not look I'm not looking to Brother Brad maybe Brother Brad uh makes a mistake should I follow brother Brad's mistake no we just say God bless brother Brad we pray for Brother Brad and we keep moving forward put any name in there brother Jason brother Matt brother this brother Jason whoever you might look at though they might fail they might make a stick mistake but we're to look to Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the Throne of God the whole process there we have the Lord Jesus he was he was rejected right so we're to look to him what are we looking at him for just to look at him just look at it no it's not just look at it there's an example there's something we're supposed to see and then something that we're supposed to emulate something that we're supposed to walk according to he suffered he was rejected he didn't like it he despised it but he he was given a reward for his obedience you know sometimes as Christians we look at it and we say well we have to follow our duty we have to do our duty regardless true and yet God continuously through the scriptures points out to us and shows us that there is actually a reward for following his word and he uses it as a motivation for us for Godly living there is a reward seek after that right there's heaven really ultimately there's a new body and there's a new Heaven and a new Earth this is our ultimate reward and a position and a place of rulership in in that new kingdom New Kingdom that's set up and so this is what we should be living for this should be motivating us this should be driving us forward in our life amen but there is also a way to seek after that that is right and a way to seek after that that is wrong now let's go to Philippians chapter 3 I sure hope brother Tony brings me that water soon Paul is speaking of his testimony and we're going to read these the verses that precede this later uh to to fill in the point but Paul is speaking of his testimony speaking about the fact that it is righteousness that comes by the Faith of Christ and not by the law not by obedience to the law and the that the purpose of this faith is that he would know Christ in the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable to his death so he's speaking of dying to himself and then Living the Life of Christ through his own flesh by knowing him that's that's the purpose of knowing him that that is our purpose as Christians right when Paul when Paul begins to tell his testimony what is he showing what is he valuing what is he looking at he's counting his past life his past Pursuits his past desires of the law and being a Pharisee and pursuing religious greatness I guess he lays that aside and says that's done I lay that aside thank you brother Tony I lay that aside so that I would know Christ and so in order for him to know Christ he has to lay aside everything from his past from his history and say that's done that's dead and I count it as refuse as dung he says I do that so I would win Christ and so he wants to let's read this verse not as though I had already attained either role already perfect but I follow after if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus all right so he wants to arrive at a particular state he wants to because he wants to arrive at perfection spiritual maturity in Christ and he connects that to knowing him knowing him in the power of his resurrection and remember we preached this before it doesn't stop there we'd like it to stop there but it says and the fellowship of his sufferings so many times we'll actually really the reality is we will not truly know the power of his resurrection unless we experience The Fellowship of his sufferings because it is in the midst of the fellowship of his sufferings that his power is made manifest to us to deliver us and heal us and to set us free and to take take the Captivity of the devil away from us it's in those places of suffering that we know him in power and so Paul is wanting to attain something he's wanting to attain we'll just put it exactly how we would speak to it today he's wanting to attain the rapture he wants to attain a new body and he wants to be caught up to meet the Lord in the air that's what Paul that's what his aim that's what his goal is that's what he's moving towards and he connects that to being perfect so he connects that Rapture to being fully mature in Christ but he then he connects that full maturity in Christ not to his moral perfection he never relates it to moral perfection sinlessness no what is he connected to knowing him and this is key and this is critical to understand we want to go in a Rapture don't ever disconnect that from knowing him if you disconnect that from knowing him you're doing something Paul never did this is what this is what the Christian life is about it's not achieving moral perfection it's knowing him and out of knowing him what happens you die to yourself and the life of Christ is manifested through your life so that's that's Paul's desire not as though I had already attained so there in his humility saying I know I know I'm not where I ultimately have to be and again this isn't just Paul talking about himself this is applying to the whole body of Christ not are we still here have we been raptured yet well I know some people have that idea but we haven't been literally physically changed and literally physically caught up to meet the Lord in the air we haven't been yet so we can say with Paul not as though I'd already attained either we're already fully mature or completed but what am I doing I'm following after on pursuing a goal what is my what am I pursuing I want to know him I want to know him in a very specific way that leads to my attainment of perfection you're trying to attain Paul is trying to attain perfection that's what he's that's what he's moving forward towards and he that's directly connected he's also trying to attain the Rapture so his pursuit of perfection and his Pursuit Of The Rapture is actually one in the same all right and that word there um that I may apprehend speaks of laying hold of to take possession of we have the word comprehend means to take hold of an understanding that's not this word this is apprehend so I want to I'm going to take a hold of a prize right there's a prize for winning the race I'm going to take a hold of it which is interesting because as you look at this verse it says I'm also apprehended of Christ Jesus so think about it that way as Christ has taken laid hold of you what does that mean it's a parallel you're his prize the bride is his prize the bride is his reward right let's I was studying last night and I I didn't even make it out of three verses in two and a half hours of studying so and I just kept kept going and I probably have six sermons here but we'll try to try to get through at least three verses but within the three verses there are about 25 verses so so this is from the whis translation Philippians 3 10 and 11. in order that I might come to know him in an experiential way and to come to know him experientially the power of his resurrection and a joint participation in his sufferings being brought to the place where my life will radiate a likeness to his death oh my if by any means I might arrive at the goal namely the out Resurrection from among those who are dead everyone is going to be in the resurrection every single person that's ever lived will be raised from the dead Paul is giving us a separate thing here by saying this word out Resurrection from among those who are dead that's the rapture so Paul is connecting this in his thought his knowing Christ in power and suffering Perfection completion maturity and attaining the Rapture Rapture those things are connected if if this is the only thing you get out of this sermon I want you to understand that you're attaining to the Rapture you're growing into Perfection is directly connected to knowing Christ in power and suffering if that's all you get today I've been successful that's what I that's one of the main things that I want you to see so here we are given a picture of a race being run that's the picture that Paul is bringing if I can go back so he's talking about following after he's reaching forward for something he's trying to win something we'll look at look at it more detailed in the next couple verses but we're going to go to First Corinthians chapter 9. speaking of running a race know ye not that they which run in a race run all but one receives the prize so run that you may obtain that's that word to lay hold of to obtain it's the same exact word in Philippians chapter 3 to to apprehend so run that you apprehend that you lay hold of the prize in other words run in a way that you're going to achieve Victory live your Christian Life in a way that you're going to overcome don't live it in a way that you're you're weak you can't overcome you can't achieve Victory you know if the holy spirit is in you you will achieve Victory but you have to run in a way that you will achieve Victory and you have to confess and speak in a way that you will achieve Victory if you speak in a way that you're losing you are losing but if you speak in a way that I am victorious I am more than a conqueror well I'm beat down I'm laying on the ground I can't even move shut up devil what does that have to do with anything God's word is more true than your circumstances Hallelujah and every man that strives for the Mastery is temperate in all things so again here here's he's speaking of wrestling now he's using wrestling as an analogy he's temperate in all things in other words he lives in such a way so that he's not a big old flabby guy that can't move people he might be a massive dude but he's living in a way to keep that that way so that he can be strong when he's in the middle of wrestling so he can do what he needs to do now they do it to obtain a corruptable crown think about it Saints think about um think about LeBron James he's an old guy now and he's been he's been playing he's been playing professional basketball for I don't even know 15 16 18 years um well he spends millions of dollars on his body immediately after a game he doesn't just go and eat a bunch of tacos immediately after the game he does core work he gets in in an ice bath he makes sure that there's recovery taking place immediately in other words his whole life is dedicated from A to Z to being on a basketball court and earning 50 million dollars a year that's his whole life is dedicated and he takes money and he dedicates it to that and he takes all of his time and dedicates it to that that is what I'm talking about this is how he's doing it to obtain a corruptable ring right yeah it's corruptable you might remember these guys in history basketball players in history just imagine if if this was thousands of years ago do you remember who won the Olympics in the year 2 BC do you remember who was born in zero BC well we we do know one person but he lived differently do you know who was born a little bit after that well we're still reading his these men's books why why what's happening here they're obtaining a corruptable crown that Fades away their memory will eventually be wiped off the Earth and it's meaningless ultimately meaningless but we're we're seeking to gain an Incorruptible ring one that will not pass away will not fade away and will be there for all eternity while though while LeBron James and Michael Jordan are completely forgotten you'll be standing on this Earth living and walking and breathing and rejoicing and having the time of your your life continuously that's an Incorruptible crown that we are seeking after therefore I therefore so run not as uncertainly not beating the air so fight-eyed not as one that beats the air so he's training he's running he's doing it very very purposefully specifically there's a there's a pro we go brother Travis and I are going to a trainer I don't know if he has a specific program but he sure is uh tearing us up but it's building strength and so there's there's a purpose there's a goal there's a plan and there is an execution of that plan what how about your Christian Life how about your walk with the Lord do you have a program do you have a plan do you have a trainer are are you dedicated to it are you waking up early are you spending your money on it your your efforts are you exerting yourself towards the towards an Incorruptible Crown wow how much more valuable than a body that's going to fade anyways but I keep under that literally means to beat until black and blue like a boxer a boxer trains to take hard punches right when you're a boxer you don't just say I'm a really good boxer and get in and somebody touches your jaw and you fall to the ground because you've never been hitting the job before you get hit all the time that's your training is to be beaten up and you train and you train and you train so that when someone punches you in the head you just go okay that happened let's let's keep going you've got to be able to take a punch that's this is a spiritual likeness we beat we have to beat our body now this is not speaking of Catholic monks flogging themselves fasting for a certain amount of days doing these things this is talking about this the the the the the the the the life of sin that wants to have dominion over us this is saying I beat that a sinful flesh I beat it into submission I bring it under into subjection it literally means I enslave my body is enslave the body and the desires of sin are you enslaving the bot are you making those sinful desires to become slaves to what you're trying to achieve in Christ to the goal that you're going after that's what we're supposed to be doing that's what Paul did that he didn't write this so he could just say man Paul was a great guy he was really cool he wrote this so that you would take this and say okay I need I need to apply this to my life I do need to enslave the body of this death this flesh to what to what to to Christ to the to the goal to the purpose of the race that I'm running at least that by any means when I should have preached to others I should be a Castaway in other words that I should be become disqualified I'm training so that I can finish the race as a winner I'm not training so that I'm all I'm disqualified from the race I'm training so I win I'm going to read it from I think I put it up here the weast also just to give some some a little bit different different layer of meaning do you not know that those who are running in a race are indeed all running but one receives the Victor's award be running in such a manner as the one who won the won the race in order that you may obtain the Victor's award everyone who participates in the athletic games exercises constant self-control in all things those to be sure in order that they may receive a perishable Victor's Garden Garland of wild olives leaves to be worn as a crown of victory but as for us a Victor's Garland which is imperishable as for myself therefore I so run in no uncertain manner I so swing my fists not as one who when fighting misses his opponent merely beating the air and not striking a straight blow which Finds Its Target Target but I beat my body black and blue and make it my abject slave lest somehow when I have preached to others I myself should be disqualified I find it fascinating there that he's he he is the eye that's speaking and he's talking about his body as the enemy as his flesh as the enemy and so his soul I think that's what he's saying his soul is in a war with his flesh and his soul is saying I'm I'm not just throwing wild punches I'm throwing them with Precision to beat against that area in my life that is weak be precise be precise with yourself if you have if you know you have an area of weakness start beating on it turn beat on it and beat on it until it's black and blue in other words be very specific with steps you take for yourself yeah yes yes we come and we come to the Altar and we pray and we ask for deliverance but this to me looks like a battle that we have to enter in on a daily basis we can get strength at the altar but we're probably going to have to learn to fight this this isn't just a spectator sport well I have a problem I'll go up to the Healer and he'll pray for me and I'll have no problems anymore in my life ever again is that how it works is that how the Christian Life Works that might that'll give us strength to the battle but it's a battle whether you want it or not you can come to the Altar and pray for no battle but it's the answer is no right right the answer is no I'm telling you right now if you you say I don't want to fight I'm tired I'm done the answer is no you're not you're not done you might be tired but just just you wait you haven't even learned about what tired is yet you're going to have to keep fighting and keep battling and you don't give up no matter what you see no matter what you feel you keep giving up Travis how many times uh when we're doing those workout routes you're like I'm doing it man the morning comes around I'm sleeping I'm sleeping in my my this hurts my that hurts and it does and I'm in so much pain how is it possible and a few minutes later we're going and we're pressing forward and you think how did I how am I even doing this and then you're more sore than you were before but what are we supposed to do we keep going every fiber in your muscles is burning and it hurts and you're sweating and you're you're you're drooping and and you feel like I can't go on what is what is it what are you supposed to do quit give up fall down keep one step in front of the other keep going keep fighting keep battling don't let the devil beat you are you kidding me he wants all he wants you to do is stop all he wants you to do is quit that's what he wants you to do the the word there in let me go back see if I go back there foreign myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind have you made mistakes yeah if you if you have if you say you haven't you're a liar that's a mistake in itself so I caught you we've all sinned and fallen short of the glory of God we've all we've all lived a life at some point in time that we're not very proud of at this moment and we can we can be limited by those things we could say I'm a horrible person I did this horrible thing yeah you did yep I did okay that's what the blood of Jesus Christ is for we forget those things that are behind but let's bring it even further because the devil wants us to focus on you made this mistake you made this mistake you're not even worthy yeah that's I've been saying that all along you're not worthy devil you you take the very thing that's true and try to make us feel bad about it when we should be rejoicing say yes I'm not worthy but the blood of Christ cleanses me from all sins that those things are thrown in the sea of God spots forgetfulness but I think even more let's think about the the other side is the Lord has done things in my life in the past that's good those are testimonies we thank the Lord for that but don't stop there don't say I had a testimony five years ago I don't need to walk with God anymore I don't need more testimonies I don't need more things to happen I had I had it from the past no forget that keep going forward there's there's more there's more to enter into there's more to press into in reaching forth unto those things which are before again what is what is before us what is Paul saying in the context the rapture and Perfection those two things so I'm reaching forth that's great the Lord did those things in my life thank you Jesus there's more for me to reach forward to there's more for me to go forward to how can we sit and say well it's enough to just have faith and be born again that's all I need I just believe in Calvary I don't need anything else that's not the attitude of a Christian the attitude of a Christian is thank you Lord for the new birth thank you for filling me with your Holy Spirit I know there's more for me I know there's more for me to reach unto that's Paul's purpose of heart let's look at pursuing looking backwards looking forwards and Luke 9 62 and Jesus said unto him no man having put his hand in the plow and looking back is fit for the kingdom of God we're not to look backwards we're to move forwards with God this is the response to someone who says let me go home and say bye to my family and take care of things at home before I serve you Lord no we drop everything and we serve him now we don't make excuses we don't say I don't have my life figured out I don't have this no that's not how salvation works I remember when I was was bad what the Lord was dealing with me trying to save me and I said to my friends well I'll get things I'll get my life straightened out and then I'll serve the Lord and they said what what's the purpose of the Gospel then we're not saved by getting our life figured out we give our life to Christ amen we put our faith in him and he figures our life out all right remember Lot's wife what good was it for her to look backwards she looked backwards and turned to a pillar of salt and her story was over and it's ended there and it's still being told of her story looking back at Sodom oh oh I'm longing for this thing or for that thing don't look back move forward with Christ Exodus 14. we're going to read 10 through 16. and when Pharaoh junai the children of Israel lifted up their eyes and behold the Egyptians marched after them and they were sore afraid and the children of Israel Cried Out unto the Lord all right they have left Egypt they're marching forward God leads him as brother Branham said look to be like God was a poor General leads them directly to a sea and what's the response they've totally forgot everything that God had done and totally forgot everything that God had promised them and we're right there in the moment looking at their circumstances and saying we're afraid Lord what do we do and they said unto Moses oh it's the prophet's fault he looked at the prophet and say our circumstances are bad we can't understand what's going on around us you must be a false prophet said unto Moses because there are no graves in Egypt has thou taken us away to die in the wilderness wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us to carry us forth out of Egypt is this not the word that we told you in Egypt saying let us alone that we may serve the Egyptians for it been better for us to serve the Egyptians than that we should die in this Wilderness my goodness and Moses said unto the people fear ye not stand still and see the salvation of the Lord which he will show to to you today for the Egyptians whom you have seen today you shall see them again no more forever so the Lord brought this as a setup he tested them right he brought them as a test will you walk by what your eyes see or will you walk by The Promise and every one of you is going to face the same thing in your life and is facing it has faced it and will continue to face it as long as you're here will you walk according to what your eyes see or will you walk according to your faith in God's word in his promises and what he's spoken to you by the scriptures and by this message the Lord shall fight for you and you shall hold your peace the Lord will fight for you and you're going to shut up that's what he just said and the Lord said unto Moses that's Faith Moses was speaking Faith that's good and the Lord said unto Moses wherefore Christ thou unto me speak unto the children of Israel that they go forward God's saying I told you to walk forward but but but there's circumstances preventing me from walking forward yeah and was it was was there some problem we had in in Egypt that got solved that I God solved the problem did he do it yeah is he leading us here well the people got mad at Moses and said God must not have appeared to you God must have not spoken to you well didn't you forget how God Vindicated his ministry God have proven his ministry time and time again and now you're faced with circumstances that are rising against you and you think must be a false prophet it's fascinating isn't it yeah it's parallels to our day today and God says to Moses why are you crying unto me speak why cry speak tell them to go forward but but but but we don't have boats we can't swim we don't have a barge go forward go forward Saints you might be blocked if if you're in the path of Duty and God has called you to do something walk forward I've seen it time and time again on the missions field if God has told you to do something though all circumstances look horrible do what God has said to do God will open the way it's up to him it's up to us to follow clear instruction it's up to God to take care of everything else though the circumstance just be be sure of this thing God will such ordain your walk that he will make the circumstances impossible well gee and you'll say Lord I thought you spoke to me and I thought you told me to do this thing but surely I must have misunderstood because all these things are against me we do that have you done it some of you are smiling because you're doing it and I'm smiling because I've done it too sure but then something Rises up and says I God has told me to do this and I'm going to do it even if I'm all alone and even if I look crazy lift up thy rod and stretch out thy hand over the sea and divide it and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea God will open the door it's up to him to open the door sometimes you might have to speak to the door you might have to speak the promise of God speak what he told you speak it to the circumstance and keep walking and Moses said unto the people uh uh what did I do here I'm all out of order no I'm not over and Moses said other people fear you not stand still and see the salvation of the Lord which he will show to you this day for the Egyptians whom you have seen today you shall see them again no more forever I just read this what am I doing aha next one oh that's the end of it all right what just happened brother Mark help me so back to verse 13 is where I want to be brother Mark Philippians 3 13. so reaching forth speaks of straining forward extending forward with the hand and foot and the body bent forward like a runner running a race like you're straining to get through the Finish Line you're you're pushing yourself forward so that you can get put every effort into obtaining victory just think of that for a minute you're running in a race and man you're pushing forward you're so hard you keep going and you keep going and it seems like this race is going to take forever exhaustion is starting to set in weariness sets in your muscles are on fire in your mind thinking I I gotta stop I gotta stop I can't do this anymore I'm gonna get injured it's impossible but then you start to remember there's a prize that's ahead remember that there's there's something of value ahead and so you you look up and you remember you remember your your teammates are counting on you your coach has asked you to do something you've got to do it every fiber of your body wants to stop the pain it's like it's like a fire going through your muscles but you strain forward with everything that's in you and you refuse to give up that's the picture I believe that Paul is trying to paint for us here he he's saying put every effort every exertion every strength and when it feels like you're going to quit just keep Reaching Forward keep going there we go Philippians 3 14 I press toward the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus there we finally got to that press the word press there and in Greek is dyoko and it means to pursue or follow in haste to press forward to strive to to do something with an intense effort to achieve a goal to strive for a purpose that's the same word that we saw also we brought out also in verse 12. he says press forward to lay hold of that which Christ Jesus laid hold of us for and the word there where it says the Mark Press towards the mark it means a goal or a purpose all right and then where it says prize it's a gift received as a prize or a reward interesting interesting way of wording that a gift received as a prize or a reward so we're running in a race we're going towards a reward but it's actually a gift right for by grace are you saved through faith that not of yourselves it's the gift of God not of Works lest any man should boast so this is a gift but God has so ordained that to get this gift we have to run we have to fight we have to battle we have to overcome overcoming is is a gift right yes and no overcoming is a reward right overcoming means there's a battle that you faced and you achieved victory But ultimately it's a gift because you're predestined to be an overcomer it's both of those things but it isn't just a gift by itself that you sit back and just receive but it is a gift that requires struggle striving difficulty that struggling struggling in difficulty doesn't earn your salvation it proves your salvation it vindicates that you are saved were to strive or to press forward to pursue strive towards the goal for the reward wouldn't it be better if we thought of our Christian Life on a daily basis like this instead of becoming lazy Christians too many times we become lazy Christians we don't look at it as we're in a battle we're in a fight we're running a race it requires constant training when you're spending time with the Lord when you're feeding on the message when you're studying the Bible when you're reading Godly books that point you to the word what are you doing you're you're training yourself for the battle you will never have strength for the battle if you don't do that but it's when the battle comes where's my weapon I don't even my my grip is so weak I can't even hold the weapon you've got it's got to be trained constantly you're you're running a race you don't just show up to the Olympics after off the couch and this is this this Christian walk and the battle that we're facing against the enemy is the Olympics right and we have we're gonna We Are ordained to Victory but there's a process and don't lose track of what is the overarching what is the overarching way to achieve Victory and have the strength is knowing him you can't lose track of that so when you're reading you're studying you're praying you're listening to messages think of it that way it's knowing him I want to know him and then God brings these circumstances these trials these difficulties to challenge us and what is what is he trying to do he's trying he's trying to get us to know him more When God says I need it there needed to be a sinner so that I could express my attribute of Salvation well that's fantastic but you just do that in a vacuum what good is it it's not in a vacuum God is it wants to express himself to you as a savior he doesn't just want to express himself randomly out in the world as a savior he wants you as an individual to know him as a savior he wants you as an individual to know him as a Healer he wants you as an individual to know him as your strength so if you're going to know him as a strength everything is going to be easy for you right everything is going to be so simple in your life that you're going to have a silver spoon there and Everything You Touch turns to gold it's not what it is in order to know God as your strength it means that there needs to be something in your life that's producing weakness because his power is made perfect in your weakness when you when you're just strong and uh everything's fine and I'm good is God being known in in strength you are being known and strength God is known in strength when you are at the end of yours and we can go on with every attribute of God love and mercy and Justice and Holiness every one of his attributes is not to be in a vacuum it's meant to be expressed and known by you brother Steve personally individually in a way that no one else could you you could explain it to us try to explain it we say that's good Doctrine brother Steve it's not supposed to be just good Doctrine you're supposed to know that Doctrine because you've walked in it and you've experienced it and you've lived it and it's manifested through your life we should put our daily effort our strength our power our time our money the focus of our life is training yourself for this purpose the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus our lord it literally means the upward calling of God I think no I don't have it there literally the upward calling of God so it's speaking of the Rapture what is the upward calling we're to be caught up in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air yeah and so that is that is the prize that we're straining and striving for if you examine your life and look at your life would you say it's characterized by straining and striving and pursuing and putting all exertion and effort into obtaining this prize or do you think it's just going to be offered up to you on a silver platter without any effort or strength or anything put into it I think sometimes As Americans we think everything should be given to us without anything and certainly salvation is a gift that is without question but Salvation is manifested in a life and you don't unless there is a life manifesting salvation there is no salvation and so if you have that gift abiding in you of eternal life it's going to be expressed in this way Paul is not trying to make you know a certain level of super Christians and everybody else just does what they want to sits in the Pew and comes to church and does nothing this is for every Christian to live and to walk in is you need to exert yourself you need to put your strength into this you need to put your time into it it takes time you know you can't you're not going to get quick fixes with Dodd sometimes he'll give that to you but usually it's when you've spent a lot of time when you've given your heart and given your life to study brother Jason gives his life to study in the word of God and his life is exudes that what about you that's not just for your pastor to do right that's not just the pastor job we're not Baptists we're not Catholics we don't show up and stick our tongue out and brother Jason slaps a Eucharist on our tongue that's we don't believe in that we don't study to show thyself approved unto God isn't just for a specialized class of people every one of us should be studying should be feeding should be feasting should be praying should be dedicating our time and our efforts to God and if there's things that are preventing that throw them away re-prioritize your time you know how many of you as the New Year comes around you look at your schedule and the things you're committed to and you say I've I've got to fix this I've got to fix this so it's right prioritize do that we should be doing that every day reprioritize your time not so your business can be successful but so that the word can be successful in your life James 1 verse 12 blessed is the man that endures temptation my goodness happy literally means happy is the man the Divine favor the deity the favor of the deity rests on the man that endures temptation how many of you talk like that oh man you know you see somebody they got a lot of money and they got nice cars and they say oh they're blessed I'm going to say stop that knock it off because James says blessed is the man that endures temptation for when he has tried so it's speaking of a trial speaking of another place that call is Peter calls it a fiery trial blessed is the man that endures fiery trials can we talk like that can we make that our speech oh you guys are dumbfounded by this just I'm gonna I'm gonna break this down a little bit just think of it and put Flesh on it the person that's there and he's struggling under a heavy weight but he's striving and he's fighting to overcome the devil with all that is his being is he's got everything is set against him blessed is that man that's the person that's blessed not the guy that has everything that he wants and never needs feel sorry for him feel sorry for that guy we have so much in America even our poorest people have so much but nevertheless think differently it isn't necessarily the blessing of the Lord to have prosperity it can be it can be a curse can be a horrible thing can take you far away from God and Jesus says that's the norm is that riches take you far away from God blessed is the man that endures Temptation for when he is tried and I think it goes without saying and overcomes he shall receive the Crown of Life which is Promised the Lord has promised to those that love him can't we just receive a crown of life if the lord loves us why do we have to have the first part of the verse because the low the ones that the lord loves he tries them and chastens them and rebukes them why because we need to be more like Christ we are we're in a condition where our lives need to be conformed unto him and so we need chastening yeah yeah brother Brad you need chastening Brother JD you need chastening looking in the mirror we need chastening every one of us to be more like Christ and he does that because he loves us we have a high calling we have an upward calling that's coming we're waiting for the rapture we're going to be caught up together with the dead Saints in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air that's the Heavenly calling we have it's a glorified body and then ultimately on a fully renewed and restored Earth and Heaven every atom in this ER in this universe is going to be renewed by Christ he's going to even change change natural laws in order to bring restoration to this to this entire universe and we're a part of that but we need to run the race in a specific way to get there you can't do it the way you want to do it sorry you can't figure out figure this out with your own plan and with your own purpose you can't live your life the way you want to live you have to be a prisoner to Christ you have to live in the manner that he asks you to live not the way not not a little bit the way Jesus wants you to live and then a little bit the way I like to live no you you surrender all of it all of your pride all of the the way you want to address where you want to live what job you want to have uh what car you drive every aspect of your life must be surrendered to Christ otherwise you haven't surrendered to Christ take up your cross and follow me Jesus says that's the only option there's not another option take up your place of torture and death and follow me that's the walk that he's called us to and that's the race that we are running together we're trying to attain something and Paul uses this terminology purposefully I believe we know that going in the Rapture is not something that we achieve by our own works you understand that right you are not going to good yourself into the Rapture you never could you will never be good enough you'll never be good enough because the object is the Holiness of God and the Holiness of God is absolutely infinite yeah yeah it's so far beyond anything that you could ever achieve or or do it's unimaginable but God has so ordained that we run a race he didn't ordain that we'd be Spectators in the stands he he ordained that we be participants in the life and manifestation of Jesus Christ and if you're not get into it how do I get into it by one Spirit we're all baptized into one body receive the Holy Ghost I want to go back I think is next uh Philippians chapter 3 verse 8. this is the start of Paul's testimony yea doubtless and I can't all things but lost for the Excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but done that I may win Christ and be found in him not having mine own righteousness see this is not our own achievement the achievement of our righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the Faith of Christ it doesn't even say your faith but it's the Faith of Christ the faith that belongs to Christ the righteousness of God which is by faith and we remember that righteousness is imputed to us through Christ in other words it's Christ's righteousness given to you as a gift and the means of obtaining it as faith and you can't have faith in yourself faith is a gift from God given to you no man can come to me unless my father except my father draws him first right but God has ordained that those who have faith would persevere in their walk with him that would run the race with patients that they would fight the battle they might they might lose battles but they're going to win the war as a whole sure you might you might fall over and over again but you get up and you keep fighting and you don't quit and you don't give up you keep enduring to the end and this is the purpose being found in him not having my own righteousness but then he and it goes on for what purpose Paul that I may know him so this is this is the the the the purpose that's going on this is Paul's purpose as a Christian that I may know him I didn't say it was the prize I said it was the purpose it was Paul's purpose I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship is of his suffering being made conformable unto his death so he counted all things as lost and done and he says he was found in him he received the Holy ghosts and this put him in Christ how do you get found in Christ you got to receive the Holy Ghost because of this he had the righteous he had musicians if he'd come I got I don't even 30 more pages probably of this so he counted all things as lost and is done he was found in Christ because of this he had the righteousness that was imputed to him by the Faith of Christ comes by faith the purpose of all this was knowing him and this is our race that's this is what our race this is your race knowing him fully by experiential knowledge not not merely doctrinal knowledge but experiential knowledge of the doctrine in your life laying hold completely of that revelation of Christ that he laid hold of us to receive the goal the purpose is knowing Christ the prize is the upward call the prize is the rapture the prize is a new new body on a new Earth the means of pursuing that goal I said this before on a repeated in closing the means of pursuing that goal is not achieving moral perfection through law-based righteousness the means of pursuing that goal is to know him both in the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable to his death or as we says that we would radiate the death of Christ think about that that our life would radiate his death his sufferings think about that we're supposed to radiate his life right but here Paul says we should radiate his death that we have died to ourselves that his life him being raised up his life would be manifested in and through us let's let's pray Heavenly Father we come before you now Lord and we ask this Lord that you would move in every heart and every every life get give each one this this Grit to run this race to press forward to press on give them that that determination in in their soul not just their spirit in their mind but Lord in their very depths of their soul they would have a determination to press on to pursue to to give all their efforts and exertions unto this purpose of knowing you the Lord I pray that your Holy Spirit would move upon every heart now with our heads bowed may your presence come and and just speak to us and deal with us Lord as do with each one on a one-on-one level well speak into their hearts the things that you're Desiring them to die too that you're calling them to put in place in their life and give them the strength Lord not just to make some pledge but but that they're they're conversation and their conduct their life would be reflective of running this race we look to you

your hand if you say I'm not quitting I'm not giving up I'm pressing forward I'm striving I'm striving for a purpose not meaningless not for a temporary goal a temporary gain but an eternal game one that I cannot lose our purpose Saints is knowing him our prize that we're striving for is a Rapture new body caught up the wedding supper we know him as he reveals himself to us in this hour unfolds himself to us and it's not just I know the message I know the doctrine and the brother Branham taught but it's you in your personal individual life God unfolding unveiling himself to you as an
