[0:24] feet amen praise the Lord let's just uh
[0:29] let's just open with the word of prayer
[0:30] this morning amen Heavenly Father we
[0:32] thank you for this day Lord we thank you
[0:34] for the another opportunity to gather in
[0:36] your house Lord Jesus and hear your word

[0:42] just edify the people Lord be with the
[0:44] entirety of the service today Lord we
[0:46] love you and we ask it in the name of
[0:48] Jesus Christ amen let us turn in our
[0:51] Bibles we're going to start with a
[0:54] scripture in Proverbs we're going to
[0:55] just do two verses so we're going to go
[0:57] to proverbs 4 and vers s and then we're
[1:00] going to move over into James 1 and
[1:03] verse 5 so this is um a part two from
[1:07] several weeks ago angles part two and
[1:10] this this morning I'd like to take uh
[1:12] like a subtitle if you will on
[1:15] perspective amen just give you a second
[1:18] to turn so proverbs 4 and verse 7 says
[1:21] wisdom is the principal thing therefore
[1:25] get wisdom and with all thy getting get
[1:29] understanding amen and let's turn into
[1:31] our Bibles to
[1:33] James 1 and verse
[1:37] 5 it's after
[1:39] [Music]
[1:42] Hebrews right before Peter James 1 and
[1:45] verse 5 and it says if any of you lack
[1:48] wisdom let him ask of God that giveth to
[1:50] all men liberally and abrath not and it
[1:53] shall be given to him amen God bless you
[1:56] as you take your seats this morning so
[1:58] in that previous lesson
[2:00] uh several weeks ago just a quick recap
[2:02] this morning um the inspiration had come
[2:05] from a story in a sermon where brother
[2:08] Brenham talks about a a sculptor a
[2:10] sculpture and there was this couple that
[2:12] was on a tour and and they began gazing
[2:15] at this sculpture and now these folks
[2:18] were were Christians but the tour guide
[2:21] began to notice that they were gazing at
[2:23] this particular um uh
[2:27] sculpture and and in a in a particular
[2:30] way and the couple recognized that this
[2:32] was a piece of art and that this piece
[2:34] of art was somehow supposed to represent
[2:37] Jesus on the cross and represent his
[2:39] sufferings but they were almost
[2:41] disappointed because of how it it seemed
[2:44] that the artist had portrayed Jesus it
[2:46] was it seemed like he just didn't he
[2:48] didn't put as much into it as they
[2:50] thought he should it was it was such
[2:52] little detail you know they felt like it
[2:54] didn't really portray the sufferings
[2:56] that Christ had gone through and the man
[2:58] that they were with it was some kind of
[2:59] a tour guide said that they weren't the
[3:02] first to say that or to say something
[3:04] like that but he drew them closer to the
[3:06] work of art and he said if you want to
[3:08] fully appreciate the entirety of it of
[3:11] the vision that the artist had you have
[3:13] to go directly in front of it and you'll
[3:16] notice that there's a place to kneel
[3:17] down amen and and they so they went
[3:20] there and there was a place to kneel
[3:21] down and they and they knelt down and
[3:24] this T this couple they took his advice
[3:27] and went in front of this artwork and as
[3:30] The Story Goes that they were both
[3:31] brought to tears to see at what depth
[3:35] the artist went into articulating the
[3:39] sufferings of Christ but it could only
[3:41] be appreciated at a certain angle amen
[3:44] it wasn't just by Pastor passing by that
[3:46] they could appreciate the entirety of it
[3:49] and and what the depth of what the
[3:51] artist was trying to articulate amen and
[3:55] so what the what the couple realized
[3:58] that just by passing by
[4:00] and people that would pass by and
[4:02] weren't willing to kneel down they would
[4:05] never see the sculpture and what the
[4:08] artist created in its entirety amen and
[4:11] it was all about perspective and and
[4:14] that was the whole point to get you a
[4:16] little bit closer to the image amen it
[4:18] was all about the angle of view and so
[4:21] we had went down a certain path last
[4:23] time with wisdom and with humility today
[4:25] we're going to deal with perspective so
[4:27] the simple the Oxford definition in the
[4:31] dictionary of perspective is a
[4:33] particular attitude toward or a way of
[4:36] regarding something a point of view you
[4:39] know sometimes I believe that if we can
[4:41] change our perspective on a matter then
[4:43] we're able to see a better outcome we're
[4:46] able to get out of our own mental headp
[4:49] space and and move into a realm of of
[4:52] possibility a realm of Faith you know
[4:54] pastors been preaching on that Faith
[4:56] amen and today and next next week's
[4:58] lesson um
[5:00] because I get Sunday school next week
[5:01] too am me and we're going to look into
[5:03] those two elements and how they blend
[5:05] together you know so in art perspective
[5:07] is actually a technique that artists use
[5:11] to create depth or the illusion of depth
[5:15] on a flat surface they they create what
[5:19] looks like At first is two-dimensional
[5:21] and they add a dimension to make it a
[5:23] 3dimensional object so in other words in
[5:26] order to have a certain amount of depth
[5:28] to the image
[5:30] the work of art it takes perspective
[5:33] amen that's a good concept in our in our
[5:35] life and in order to fully operate as a
[5:39] as a Christian in maturity and take your
[5:42] walk with Christ past just being surf
[5:45] surface level religion and add some
[5:47] depth to it I believe it takes some
[5:49] perspective amen and it takes seeing
[5:52] things from the lens that God sees it
[5:54] from God's perspective on it amen and I
[5:57] want to go through uh a few examples
[5:59] this morning morning um but I want to I
[6:01] want to drive that point down rather
[6:03] than staying in the natural realm all
[6:04] the time that's what Pastor trying to to
[6:06] drive down what rather than staying in
[6:07] the natural all the time to look in this
[6:09] in the Supernatural in the spiritual
[6:11] through the lens of of how God is
[6:13] looking at it amen because what what
[6:15] happens often times with myself maybe
[6:17] I'm the only one but we often times we
[6:19] get ourselves trapped into seeing things
[6:21] that are happening in happening in our
[6:23] life from a certain angle or or a very
[6:26] narrow perspective amen I hope I'm not
[6:29] the only one um sometimes it's just as
[6:31] simple as as we're living in a faithless
[6:35] society amen and we're just constantly
[6:38] bombarded with distractions that's just
[6:40] the way that it is and that's why it's
[6:43] so crucial to separate yourself from the
[6:45] things of the world to get alone with
[6:47] God and let God minister to your heart
[6:49] and allow him to see things with greater
[6:52] depth amen and I believe we all want
[6:54] greater depth in our life uh and you
[6:56] know that's the importance of coming to
[6:58] church that's the importance of hearing
[7:00] the word go forth of reading your Bible
[7:02] of hearing the tapes those things matter
[7:04] and you know I can't tell you how many
[7:06] times especially lately that I've come
[7:08] to these junctures in my life even
[7:10] recently you know where I I've felt like
[7:13] such a failure in some of those Avenues
[7:15] oh yeah anybody anybody there with me I
[7:18] I can look back at times in my life
[7:20] where I felt like I had really good
[7:23] habits in of reading my Bible of of
[7:25] listening to these tapes and my prayer
[7:27] life seemed like it was in a better
[7:28] place and my Faith seemed like it was
[7:30] better then or greater then than it is
[7:32] now I don't know if anybody else gets to
[7:34] thinking like that but then I started to
[7:36] think about you know then I started to
[7:38] think about if I could get myself you
[7:40] know back in that place somehow you know
[7:43] and and say Lord forgive me about the
[7:44] place that I'm in now let me get back to
[7:47] that place where maybe I felt so
[7:48] elevated but as I began thinking on this
[7:50] subject and the Lord began dealing with
[7:52] me on this subject you know I believe
[7:54] that we ought to strive for greater
[7:56] depths than what we used to be in amen
[7:58] because that was fine and good for that
[8:00] time in our life amen we were dealing
[8:03] and battling with things at our life at
[8:04] that point and that's where we needed to
[8:06] be and I know maybe sometimes we're not
[8:09] exactly where we should
[8:10] [Music]
[8:14] be amen
[8:34] amen pardon this Interruption
[8:47] here praise the Lord don't know what
[8:50] that
[8:52] meant
[8:53] amen God is good all the
[8:57] time but a song of Praise In This Heart
[9:02] of Mine amen we're just going to press
[9:04] on right now cuz I don't have sound but
[9:06] that's okay um but you know we get to
[9:10] being in this place where we want to get
[9:13] back to where we used to be amen and I
[9:15] sometimes I I I want to I I do that I I
[9:18] look back and I'm saying Lord I want to
[9:19] be there but we're not supposed to Look
[9:21] Backwards amen we're supposed to look
[9:23] forwards we're supposed to look at what
[9:26] God wants us to be in now because now
[9:28] we're dealing deal with different things
[9:30] than we were dealing with then so we're
[9:32] in a different battle than we are than
[9:35] we were at that point so God needs us to
[9:37] have greater depth in our Christian walk
[9:39] he needs us to have a a different you
[9:41] know having a prayer life those things
[9:43] are fundamental and you got to have
[9:45] those things so you know if you need to
[9:46] get back to that part of it then
[9:48] definitely get back to that part of it
[9:50] but he wants you to to go further in
[9:53] your further than you were amen he wants
[9:56] you to have a prayer life where it's
[9:58] where it's just a constant an
[9:59] intercession you're constantly in
[10:01] fellowship with him maybe maybe you
[10:02] don't have time to get on your knees you
[10:05] know two hours a day like you wish you
[10:07] could I don't I I I wish I did I don't
[10:10] have the time but if I'm constantly
[10:12] praying the Bible says without ceasing
[10:14] throughout my day then you're able to be
[10:17] in prayer you're able to be in
[10:18] fellowship with God the way that he
[10:20] intends it to be and he knows he knows
[10:22] that you're constantly inundated with
[10:24] society and inundated with things but if
[10:27] you can just set yourself set your mind
[10:29] mind decide even when you're doing
[10:30] things even when you're driving down the
[10:31] road even even whatever you're doing you
[10:34] can be in fellowship with the Creator
[10:36] amen and I believe that's that's a a
[10:40] place that we ought to strive for um you
[10:43] know as we Face new challenges in our
[10:46] life right and and as even as
[10:49] spiritually strong as you felt like you
[10:52] were at that point God wants you to to
[10:57] to push forward um you know because it's
[11:00] no longer the reality of of you right
[11:03] now that back then is no longer the
[11:05] reality of what you're facing now amen
[11:08] and God wants us to press towards the
[11:10] mark meaning looking forward looking
[11:12] ahead amen and and that's that's such a
[11:15] huge tactic that the enemy uses in your
[11:18] life is to keep you looking behind even
[11:21] in past Victory you're supposed to look
[11:23] at your past Victory and allow it to
[11:25] help you grow but if you only are
[11:27] looking at your past you're not being
[11:30] able to focus on your future and I was
[11:32] just thinking about about you know that
[11:35] scripture where it says remember Lot's
[11:36] wife you know she had this message of
[11:38] Deliverance she had this this this this
[11:40] opportunity to be delivered from
[11:42] something but she was so focused on her
[11:45] heart was some so far back in in in
[11:49] Sodom that she couldn't look forward
[11:51] amen she she didn't have that that
[11:53] ability in her heart
[11:57] um amen so
[12:02] the devil getting back to the tactics he
[12:05] knows you know he he knows how it works
[12:08] he knows if there's no life behind your
[12:11] testimony then he's keeping you at a
[12:13] standstill you know maybe maybe
[12:16] yesterday was a failure maybe you
[12:18] haven't done things the way that you
[12:20] felt you ought to you know this is just
[12:23] a reminder that you don't have to let
[12:25] those things condemn you amen you take a
[12:29] little half step and just and realign
[12:31] yourself right now and then you can use
[12:35] the devil's tactic on him and say look
[12:38] those things there's no condemnation in
[12:40] me I you're right I was a failure
[12:41] yesterday you're right I didn't pray
[12:43] enough yesterday but today a new day and
[12:45] I'm going to strive and press toward the
[12:47] mark because I I don't need to look in
[12:49] the past I need to look forward amen and
[12:52] remind him that he's that he's defeated
[12:54] and that every failure you have you know
[12:57] every failure you have is Washed by the
[12:59] blood of the Lamb amen and it's
[13:01] accounted on his behalf not on yours um
[13:04] and that you're living in Victory so
[13:05] with this concept of what artists call
[13:10] perspective um this is a definition that
[13:14] that I began to look at over the last
[13:16] several days and the definition in the
[13:20] world of art is the art of drawing solid
[13:24] objects on a two-dimensional surface so
[13:28] as to give the right impression of their
[13:31] height width depth and position in
[13:34] related to each other when viewed from a
[13:37] particular point so in other words it
[13:40] creates a realistic sense to the image
[13:43] amen and it it allows you to to see the
[13:46] image from the Viewpoint that the artist
[13:48] intended from it so it creates depth on
[13:51] the on a flat surface it's an added it's
[13:54] an added Dimension and so you know just
[13:57] in simple terms you you know it it takes
[13:59] a picture that you're looking at and it
[14:02] adds it adds almost if I could put it
[14:05] like this it adds a reality to it amen
[14:07] and so they can't trace it back exactly
[14:11] to where it was invented One Source I I
[14:13] came across they they thought maybe that
[14:15] it was in the fifth fifth century uh
[14:18] another source noted that it was around
[14:20] the 15th century that this concept came
[14:22] about called linear perspective am me
[14:25] and linear perspective it was an artist
[14:27] and architect named filipo and he added
[14:30] this dimensional concept to his
[14:33] architecture that allowed him to draw a
[14:37] building to look exactly as it did in
[14:40] real life amen it so it was it was
[14:44] beforehand and I was looking at some
[14:45] pictures this morning if you look at a
[14:47] at uh nonprospective pictures before
[14:50] this point they would draw people it was
[14:53] almost like they were above the other
[14:55] people to make it look like they were
[14:56] behind them but then he added this this
[14:58] perspective Ive Point these geometrical
[15:00] angles to make it look as if you were
[15:02] looking at the real image of it to make
[15:04] it look like it was a reality amen and
[15:06] I'm probably butcher butchering this
[15:08] with some with some artists but just um
[15:11] concept of the spiritual types that it
[15:13] that it came about just really struck me
[15:16] and what I like to think about is this
[15:20] that around the time that the Holy Ghost
[15:24] came that's the time that real
[15:26] perspective was born into the life of a
[15:28] believer amen you know it was always the
[15:31] Holy Ghost always would come and anoint
[15:33] even in the Old Testament would come and
[15:35] anoint but it was the Holy Ghost that
[15:36] did that right but now when the Holy
[15:39] Ghost came he was able to indwell within
[15:41] us and give us a perspective that God
[15:45] you know and we're going to get to this
[15:46] in just a minute if I have if we have
[15:47] time but when God was training the
[15:50] disciples he would even and we're going
[15:52] to get to that specific story about the
[15:54] fishes and the loaves I'm getting ahead
[15:56] of myself but he he said go I I have
[15:59] these people that I want to be fed and
[16:01] he said what food do you have and so the
[16:04] disciples said well I found this you
[16:05] know we're all familiar with that story
[16:06] you know we have this this this boy and
[16:09] he's got fishes and Loaves but how are
[16:11] we ever GNA I mean we're how we going to
[16:13] feed 5,000 people without with that
[16:15] amount of food you know so what they
[16:16] were doing is they were they had a human
[16:18] perspective a human side to it this
[16:20] doesn't make any sense but God's
[16:22] perspective showed that it didn't matter
[16:24] the the physical materials of or the or
[16:27] the the the sustenance that they were
[16:29] looking at then God had a different
[16:31] perspective on it amen and he was trying
[16:33] to show them he was trying to bring out
[16:36] look there is a reality behind this and
[16:38] he was trying to bring it out because he
[16:40] knew that eventually amen he was trying
[16:43] to know because eventually they would
[16:44] have to have a Ministry without him
[16:47] without without the physical aspect of
[16:49] Jesus they were going to have a Ministry
[16:51] of of the son of man without the son of
[16:53] man physically being there amen and
[16:55] that's what he was trying to get them to
[16:58] to to realize look you're G to you're
[17:00] going to go and Peter and and brother
[17:01] Jason kind of touched on this a lot
[17:04] better than I will but he he said you
[17:06] know when when Peter came to that gate
[17:08] beautiful you know and he started they
[17:10] started having these Miracles and they
[17:11] he started all these things started
[17:13] following his life there was a a a
[17:15] perspective because he was able to look
[17:17] back and remember that Jesus performed
[17:19] these things it didn't make sense but it
[17:21] doesn't have to make sense with the
[17:22] senses that we feel and see and hear and
[17:24] taste and smell there's a different
[17:26] sense there's something that that is
[17:28] that is over top of the senses that we
[17:31] have amen and it and it indwells within
[17:33] you today as a Believer sitting in these
[17:36] pews
[17:38] amen so this concept of of linear
[17:42] perspective is that it takes these these
[17:45] pieces of art these drawings and it adds
[17:48] a sense of of depth to it amen and we
[17:51] kind of touched touched on that um you
[17:54] know and so the disciples when they had
[17:56] this and they watched and perform those
[17:58] miracles
[17:59] Jesus said and I wanted to read this
[18:01] quote from Brother brandham In 1953 he
[18:04] said in prep the sermon preparation he
[18:07] said one time there was this little boy
[18:08] that came to Jesus the whole 5,000 and
[18:11] this is just to help you help you
[18:13] realize the point of view that we're
[18:15] coming from the whole 5,000 people that
[18:18] were hungry the little boy had five
[18:20] biscuits and two and three fishes wasn't
[18:23] very much in his hands but when it once
[18:26] got into Jesus's hands it f thousands
[18:30] see while it was in his hands it was
[18:32] just a few biscuits so while it was in
[18:35] while it's in our hands it may not seem
[18:37] like very much and it could hardly even
[18:39] feed the boy himself but in the hands of
[18:42] Christ it fed thousands amen so that
[18:46] little faith this is this is a direct
[18:47] quote brother brandom says 1953 in
[18:49] preparation 1111 that little faith that
[18:52] you've got tonight just enough to get
[18:55] you out to the church turn it loose
[18:59] amen you turn that thing that you have
[19:02] that faith that that that faith that you
[19:04] have you turn it loose you let God take
[19:06] a hold of it you let God have his
[19:09] perspective in your life and he takes
[19:12] those few loaves those few fishes when
[19:15] he creates these things that you didn't
[19:17] even you didn't even know were possible
[19:20] amen it's it's in so in the operation of
[19:23] of Faith you've got to take your sight
[19:27] on the matter and you place place it
[19:29] into the hands of Jesus the the great
[19:31] artist amen and just like a great artist
[19:34] will do he's the one that adds the depth
[19:38] to it amen you know um just in a just
[19:43] thinking about this if you've ever had
[19:45] you know a friend or maybe just an
[19:47] acquaintance rather and you just feel
[19:49] like you couldn't you could never maybe
[19:52] connect with them anybody have that you
[19:54] know you just you just felt like you
[19:55] just couldn't maybe you didn't know them
[19:56] very long or whatever it was you
[19:58] couldn't get maybe past the small talk
[20:00] there wasn't really any depth to your to
[20:02] your relationship amen and you know
[20:05] maybe there was just no relationship
[20:07] there you know maybe it's because you
[20:09] haven't spent enough time together or
[20:10] you haven't really gone through anything
[20:12] together but regardless it's just um
[20:14] it's just a two-dimensional friendship
[20:16] right it God wants more than that with
[20:19] us amen he wants he wants he wants
[20:22] something with greater depth and that
[20:24] that's why he allows trials to come
[20:27] that's why they're more precious to us
[20:29] than gold amen because it brings us to
[20:33] an elevated depth of of fellowship with
[20:36] him and that's what Jesus was was trying
[20:38] to teach his disciples in his ministry
[20:41] one day he wasn't going to be with them
[20:43] anymore and brother Jason is probably
[20:45] tired of me stealing his material but um
[20:49] one day he wouldn't physically be with
[20:50] them anymore but he wanted to show them
[20:52] how to operate the way that he would
[20:54] operate amen and to see things from his
[20:57] perspective and I wanted to touch on
[20:58] this if I could I just have a few
[21:00] minutes now and this is what I wanted to
[21:01] get to this morning this is kind of the
[21:03] core of my my heart is looking at Paul
[21:06] in 2 Corinthians which is a familiar
[21:09] reading we're just going to pick it up
[21:10] today 2 Corinthians chap 12 we're going
[21:12] to read um verses 1 1 through eight and
[21:15] it says it is not expedient for me
[21:18] doubtless to Glory I will come to
[21:21] visions and Revelations of the Lord I
[21:23] knew a man in Christ above 14 years ago
[21:26] whether in the body I cannot tell or
[21:28] whether out of the body I cannot tell
[21:30] God knoweth such as one caught up to the
[21:33] third heaven and I knew such a man
[21:35] whether in the body or out of the body I
[21:36] cannot tell God knoweth how that he was
[21:39] caught up into paradise and heard
[21:40] unspeakable Words which it is not even
[21:42] lawful for a man to utter of such un
[21:45] will I Glory yet of myself I will not
[21:47] Glory but in mine infirmities for though
[21:50] I would desire to Glory I should not be
[21:53] I shall not be a fool for I will say the
[21:55] truth but now I forbear lest any man
[21:57] should think of me above that which he
[21:59] seeth me to be or that he heareth of me
[22:03] and lest I should be exalted above the
[22:05] measure through the abundance of the
[22:07] revelations there was given to me a
[22:09] thorn in the flesh the messenger of
[22:11] Satan to Buffet me lest I should be
[22:14] exalted above measure and this is the
[22:16] this is the part I want to focus on for
[22:18] this thing I besought the Lord Thrice
[22:21] that it might depart from me amen and
[22:23] we're all familiar with that Paul had
[22:25] this infirmity this aspect of his
[22:27] natural body that was clearly causing
[22:30] him grief and and travail and I want to
[22:33] point out here that it caused him so
[22:35] much grief that this wasn't just your
[22:36] run-of-the-mill trial he was so vexed
[22:39] for this thing that he actually felt to
[22:41] bring it up to the creator of the
[22:42] universe three times amen he sought the
[22:45] Lord three times on this matter and when
[22:48] God went to go answer his prayer he
[22:50] answered it was something that was going
[22:52] to be more powerful than a natural
[22:55] healing he said my strength is made
[22:57] perfect in weakness in verses 9 he said
[23:00] my grace is sufficient for thee for my
[23:02] strength is made perfect in weakless
[23:04] most gladly therefore will I rather
[23:07] glory in mine infirmities that the power
[23:10] of Christ May rest upon me therefore I
[23:13] take pleasure in mine infirmities in
[23:15] reproaches in Necessities in
[23:17] persecutions in distresses for Christ's
[23:20] sake for when I am weak then I am I
[23:23] strong so Paul had this revelation of
[23:26] this situation that he was in from his
[23:28] trial that would give more glory to God
[23:32] than if it were if he were to physically
[23:33] heal me and looking at that at that
[23:36] scripture to be able to actually have
[23:38] that kind of testimony it takes a real
[23:40] witness a real presence of Christ in
[23:43] your life to have an infirmity is one
[23:45] thing but to be able to take pleasure in
[23:48] it is a whole another thing Paul was
[23:50] able to add this whole new layer of
[23:54] perspective to his situation you know
[23:56] because what happens when when we're
[23:58] going through things sometimes
[24:00] physically or or mind battles we often
[24:03] pray for instant relief amen who who
[24:06] else does that I me and that's not a bad
[24:08] thing we all we want that it's instant
[24:10] relief because it's something that we're
[24:12] physically dealing with right here and
[24:13] right now and I know that's the that's
[24:15] sometimes the very first thing that I
[24:17] that I've done and that have and
[24:19] probably will do but we read that the
[24:22] trying of your faith worketh patience
[24:25] right and that we're supposed to let
[24:27] patience have her per work so that we
[24:29] can be perfect and entire wanting
[24:31] nothing direct quote out of James 1: 3
[24:34] and 4 amen so in order for us to have
[24:36] this layer of faith into our lives we
[24:39] ought to seek the Lord's will for this
[24:41] infirmity or anything that we go through
[24:44] as a Believer because it's not just
[24:45] happen stce that you're going through
[24:47] this thing amen it's for our perfecting
[24:51] and if the first thing the and I don't
[24:54] want I don't want you to get caught up
[24:55] in in this in shackles here cuz you
[24:57] don't need to live with that forever
[24:59] amen he's going to he is the he is the
[25:01] Lord that Health our diseases amen he is
[25:03] faithful and he's true and he will
[25:05] deliver you of that thing but my my
[25:08] objective from this morning and this is
[25:09] how the Lord dealt with me is that we
[25:12] ought to approach that from a different
[25:14] perspective and be able to say before we
[25:16] pray for immediate relief or if that's
[25:18] the first thing that we get to let's say
[25:21] Lord I I know that this is obviously
[25:24] something that you knew I was going to
[25:25] have to go through before I even went
[25:27] through it you saw this it went across
[25:29] your desk so there's something that you
[25:30] want me to learn from it maybe there's
[25:32] something that you want somebody else to
[25:34] learn from it I don't know Lord help me
[25:36] get whatever it is out of this situation
[25:39] that you need me to get from it amen
[25:41] that's the prayer that I want to pray
[25:43] from now on that when I'm going through
[25:45] something it doesn't it doesn't matter
[25:47] if it's physical mental whatever Lord
[25:49] help me to learn from this and then
[25:52] because I know you have always delivered
[25:54] me I know you're going to deliver me
[25:55] Lord that that should be a clear
[25:56] expectation he's going to deliver you of
[25:58] whatever it is that is a solid
[26:00] expectation that God is the Healer of
[26:03] your diseases mentally physically
[26:05] spiritually and every way amen but Lord
[26:07] help me to have a different layer a
[26:09] different depth a different perspective
[26:11] and say Lord help me learn from this
[26:14] thing help me help me understand what it
[26:16] is that you want me to grow how you want
[26:18] me to grow from this situation amen who
[26:20] else wants that I want to have that let
[26:22] to let patience if we
[26:25] wouldn't if we wouldn't ever do that
[26:28] then if we always pray for immediate
[26:31] relief and then if that's how how it
[26:33] ends up happening if we get that we
[26:35] would never be able to reach that level
[26:37] of maturity that we're ordained for amen
[26:39] patience would never have her perfect
[26:42] work that God intended for in our lives
[26:44] because we would never be going through
[26:45] anything you know if I had you know if I
[26:47] had a headache right then and then two
[26:50] minutes later you know I prayed instant
[26:51] relief i' have no headache well where's
[26:53] the trial there amen and I I don't want
[26:56] that to again I don't want that to get
[26:57] you caught up in that you don't have to
[26:59] live in that I'm just trying to get you
[27:01] to have a different perspective on what
[27:02] we're going through in life
[27:04] amen we all desire relief from our
[27:07] hardships amen and we all we all we
[27:10] that's a normal thing we know that God
[27:12] is is faithful but there is also
[27:15] something greater that he wants from us
[27:17] amen and that's for us to live and walk
[27:19] as adopted Sons and Daughters of Christ
[27:21] with maturity with true faith and with
[27:24] the true attributes of his divine nature
[27:27] amen and the Lord has just been dealing
[27:29] with me heavy on this for the past
[27:31] several
[27:32] days
[27:34] amen I want the Lord to just add layers
[27:37] of depth in my Christian walk so before
[27:39] I could just go right into praying for
[27:42] just a certain Deliverance that I can
[27:44] let my desire first to be Lord bring me
[27:47] bring out the lesson in which you want
[27:49] me to learn from this circumstance amen
[27:51] help me have if I have the wrong
[27:53] attitude if I've if I've grown to have
[27:54] bitterness in it Lord change my heart
[27:56] maybe it's as simple as the Lord is
[27:57] trying to to activate your faith in a
[27:59] certain area so that you can you can
[28:02] take that thing and you can make it a
[28:04] reality because God placed within you of
[28:07] Faith amen he'll shape it
[28:09] amen say Lord help me Lord Lord help me
[28:13] Heavenly Father we thank you for this
[28:15] day we ask that you would just Lord
[28:16] bring this word alive into our hearts I
[28:19] pray you'd be with the minist ministry
[28:20] Lord Jesus be with brother Jason as he
[28:22] brings the word into our hearts Lord
[28:24] Jesus Through Your Holy Spirit father we
[28:26] love you and we commit our ways to you
[28:28] in Jesus name amen God bless you
