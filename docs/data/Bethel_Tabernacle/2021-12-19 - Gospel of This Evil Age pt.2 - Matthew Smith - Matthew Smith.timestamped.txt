[3:02] okay
[3:02] um let's all uh stand and have a word of
[3:05] prayer
[3:07] and your lord i want to invite you into
[3:09] our midst this morning and as you anoint
[3:11] my my own tongue that i would be able to
[3:13] speak to the people what you put on my
[3:14] heart and i went the areas that they'd
[3:16] be able to hear and asked it you'd make
[3:18] it so it's not just some some
[3:19] information for these people but that
[3:21] they'd be able to take something from it
[3:22] that would help them throughout the day
[3:23] and then they would
[3:25] live closer to you because of it yes
[3:26] he's in jesus name amen
[3:28] um we want to go ahead and turn
[3:32] to revelations chapter 17.
[3:38] and
[3:45] in verse 1.
[3:49] and there came one of the seven angels
[3:51] which um uh
[3:53] the seven angels which had the seven
[3:55] vials and talked with me saying unto me
[3:57] come heather i will show thee unto thee
[4:00] the judgment of the great that
[4:01] sitteth upon many waters
[4:04] um with whom the kings of the earth have
[4:05] committed fornication and the
[4:07] inhabitants of the earth have been made
[4:09] drunk with the wine of her fornication
[4:11] and then skipping down to verse 15
[4:14] and he saith unto me the waters which
[4:16] thou sawest where the horses are peoples
[4:19] and multitudes and nations and tongues
[4:22] and the ten horns which thou sawest upon
[4:24] the beast these shall hate the and
[4:26] shall make her desolate and naked and
[4:29] shall eat her flesh and burn her with
[4:30] fire
[4:31] for god hath put in their hearts to
[4:33] fulfill his will and to agree and give
[4:36] their kingdom unto the beast until the
[4:38] words of god shall be fulfilled and the
[4:41] woman which thou sawest is the great
[4:43] city which reigneth over the kings of
[4:45] the earth
[4:46] now uh y'all can be seated um
[4:49] we want to pick up from where we were
[4:50] last uh last time and where we got to
[4:53] last time was i kind of did a little
[4:55] history class and we kind of see how a
[4:57] lot of what we're seeing today is is um
[5:01] in terms of uh things like uh critical
[5:03] theory that's where we ended was i gave
[5:05] a quick little definition of critical
[5:06] theory where it's it's cultural
[5:08] communism and how we we know that this
[5:10] is very popular uh today that it's it's
[5:13] a huge issue
[5:15] um and it's even seeping into the
[5:17] churches and things like that where we
[5:19] we on the first class that we did um
[5:21] with uh
[5:23] sort of
[5:24] these things being accepted by the
[5:25] baptist church and the presbyterian
[5:26] church and how that there was a parallel
[5:28] there with the social gospel movement
[5:30] back in the early 1900s well
[5:33] i want to kind of wrap up um
[5:36] sort of where we are in terms of social
[5:38] issues um because i mentioned this
[5:40] before something called um critical
[5:43] queer theory
[5:44] now this is an actual
[5:47] people think oh let's you use the word
[5:48] queer well that's the actual terminology
[5:50] that they use it's actual academic term
[5:52] um and
[5:54] i don't want to spend too much time on
[5:55] this because i feel like the lord is
[5:56] kind of shifting my direction here but
[5:58] um the
[6:00] this is sort of the pinnacle of where
[6:01] critical theory ends up
[6:04] um
[6:05] it's the complete degeneration of any
[6:07] sort of moral fabric or or instant sort
[6:10] of um
[6:11] uh objective standard of morality um
[6:15] i want to read actually excuse me a
[6:18] um a quote from an academic paper this
[6:21] was published in i believe 2017 though i
[6:24] think it was republished in 2018 in a
[6:26] different journal as well
[6:28] and this uh
[6:30] academic article i mean this is
[6:31] peer-reviewed so this is
[6:33] the all the universities have rubber
[6:35] stamped this as
[6:36] coin of the realm this is as good as it
[6:38] gets this is taken as serious as a heart
[6:40] attack in congress this is the cutting
[6:43] edge of academic thought in this realm
[6:46] and the title of this article is
[6:49] queer futurity and childhood innocence
[6:52] beyond the in injury of development now
[6:56] that is
[6:57] a mouthful of a title and i could spend
[6:59] 20 minutes breaking that down alone
[7:02] and but i just want to read the first
[7:04] two paragraphs of this so you can kind
[7:05] of see
[7:06] what
[7:08] what the what
[7:10] queer theory is really trying to
[7:12] push
[7:13] and so it starts here
[7:15] in 1991 eve sedgwick published an essay
[7:18] that may be said to have initiated
[7:20] contemporary queer theories
[7:23] consideration of childhood as a site of
[7:25] heteronormative
[7:27] intervention
[7:29] it's always open season on gay kids the
[7:31] late queer theorist famously quipped in
[7:33] an article that was audaciously titled
[7:35] how to bring your kids up gay
[7:39] sedgwick contended that desire for
[7:42] non-gay outcome was pervasive in how
[7:45] adults deal with the appearance of
[7:47] non-normative
[7:49] gender or sexual desire in childhood
[7:54] advice on how to help your kids turn out
[7:56] gay not to mention your students
[7:58] parishioners your therapy clients or
[8:00] your military subordinates sedgwick
[8:02] suggested is less ubiquitous than you
[8:04] might think
[8:06] she was concerned with the amount of
[8:08] interferences being made into young
[8:10] lives that aimed to straighten out their
[8:12] futures was disturbed by large amounts
[8:14] of suicides and uh and brought the
[8:18] helping professions to task for their
[8:20] catastrophic support for beliefs that
[8:23] queer childhood was not viable or
[8:25] healthy
[8:27] now
[8:28] that's might that's a lot of big words
[8:30] and that's a kind of a little bit of
[8:32] word salad
[8:33] um
[8:35] but
[8:37] and i don't want to spend too much time
[8:38] on it but the bottom line of that
[8:40] is
[8:42] that is the
[8:44] there's nothing less than the 21st
[8:46] century mob of sodom and gomorrah
[8:49] um
[8:51] demanding the angels right which is
[8:54] whatever's pure and innocent and
[8:56] god-like the innocent thing that's
[8:57] within a child they're demanding that
[9:00] to make it like them
[9:02] they they can't let kids be kids they
[9:05] can't just assume that kids will grow up
[9:07] to be normal healthy adults with normal
[9:09] healthy desires they have to
[9:11] psychologically manipulate kids into
[9:13] this way of thinking okay because and
[9:16] and i could that's just the first couple
[9:18] paragraphs of that article
[9:20] as you read down into it um
[9:22] i mean she's they're openly talking
[9:24] about how you know we need to treat all
[9:25] kids as if they're all queer and queer
[9:28] is now the the standard and um
[9:32] you know they talk about destroying the
[9:33] heteronormative right heterosexual and
[9:36] normal they believe that that's a bad
[9:38] thing right and we have to tear it all
[9:40] down
[9:41] so
[9:42] we know that i mean this is the this is
[9:44] it's sodom and gor sodom and gomorrah
[9:46] manifested in the 21st century
[9:49] now
[9:50] the thing is
[9:52] this isn't
[9:53] this isn't a big secret it's not a
[9:55] mystery
[9:56] it's not like message people are the
[9:58] only no people who know this is going on
[10:01] um
[10:02] half the country knows this is what's
[10:03] going on
[10:04] um
[10:06] you have um
[10:08] if you look at the the recent virginia
[10:10] election the governor of virginia
[10:12] virginia just won the election based
[10:14] almost entirely on him just making a
[10:17] promise that he's going to get this
[10:18] stuff out of the schools
[10:20] the governor of florida is getting huge
[10:23] popularity across the country for also
[10:26] proposing legislation that they're going
[10:27] to ban this stuff you're seeing a
[10:29] massive reaction to this what what sort
[10:32] of
[10:33] in popular media and popular uh culture
[10:37] they're recognizing it as communism
[10:39] they're recognizing they're going back
[10:40] and seeing the founding
[10:42] writings about this and they're they're
[10:44] scared about it
[10:46] people are terrified of
[10:48] this new wave of communism
[10:52] that's coming in
[10:53] um
[10:54] and um
[10:57] there's also a um you're seeing it
[10:59] especially the younger generation i
[11:01] remember back in 2015 when
[11:04] uh they the supreme court effectively
[11:06] nationally legalized gay marriage in the
[11:08] u.s remember a lot of people were all
[11:10] like you know religious folks and
[11:12] especially people were all horrified
[11:13] like oh it's sodom and gomorrah i
[11:15] remember thinking back then because i
[11:16] was in college and i saw i was seeing
[11:18] all the queer theory stuff back then and
[11:20] most people had no idea anything about
[11:22] that and i'm thinking oh you all have no
[11:24] idea what's coming like like it's
[11:26] there's something come that you don't
[11:28] you can't even believe but
[11:31] now
[11:32] now that it's sort of manifested i'm
[11:34] also seeing a reaction in the younger
[11:36] people
[11:38] people who grew up because you got to
[11:39] think eve sedgwick wrote that paper you
[11:42] know how to bring your kids up gay in
[11:43] 1991
[11:44] that's older than i am
[11:46] right this is
[11:48] this is
[11:50] my generation grew up with that
[11:52] we we grew up knowing what the results
[11:55] of that is we know that in in the trans
[11:58] community there's like a 60 suicide rate
[12:00] you push kids down that road it's not
[12:02] going to end well
[12:03] right
[12:05] there's it's it's catastrophe too many
[12:07] people in my generation know what in
[12:09] what lies down that road
[12:12] and
[12:14] they're they're reacting to it you saw
[12:15] this with um
[12:17] uh
[12:18] there's a
[12:19] for instance there i saw some data um
[12:22] where they this is from an organization
[12:24] called glad
[12:25] um it's kind of an activist group but
[12:26] they do they do some polling data and
[12:29] they did they have the um accelerating
[12:31] acceptance
[12:33] uh poll that they do
[12:34] um every year it's like a report
[12:37] where they get the
[12:38] sort of the national opinions on lgbtq
[12:41] by the way you have you ever noticed
[12:43] that they started adding letters to that
[12:44] acronym and the queue stands for queer
[12:46] by the way
[12:47] um
[12:49] and also there's a plus at the end of it
[12:50] a lot of times because there's actually
[12:52] the acronyms like 30 letters long now
[12:54] um
[12:55] but
[12:56] the
[12:57] they did a a survey and part of the
[12:59] survey was how what percentage of non
[13:02] lgbtq 18 to 34 year olds identify
[13:06] themselves as queer or gay allies
[13:10] in 2016
[13:13] it was
[13:14] 63 percent
[13:17] of 18 to 34 year olds as of 2018 it is
[13:22] 45
[13:24] okay
[13:25] the younger generations are starting to
[13:27] have a shift um is this especially
[13:29] pronounced among young young men um in
[13:31] 2016 it was 62 percent and as of 2019
[13:35] i'm sorry was this yeah 2018 i'm sorry
[13:39] it was 35
[13:41] so you're seeing a massive shift almost
[13:43] that entire shift in the total numbers
[13:44] was entirely to young men who are
[13:47] bailing out of
[13:48] the critical theories the the the um
[13:52] sort of the gay acceptance movement like
[13:53] no no this is something sinister here
[13:54] and we don't want any part of it and so
[13:56] what i'm seeing especially in young men
[13:58] amongst young men
[14:00] is there's a massive shift back towards
[14:02] conservatism
[14:04] christian conservatism especially you
[14:06] saw this with the rise of jordan
[14:08] peterson okay he's more or less a
[14:11] secular guy but he uses the bible and
[14:14] um just general christian principles to
[14:19] to get young men to be responsible and
[14:21] and just teaches them general christian
[14:23] values which
[14:24] honestly can help people um even if you
[14:27] sort of remove the supernatural bible
[14:28] it's still the truth right and it'll
[14:30] still help people but it's not going to
[14:31] get them to heaven
[14:32] right
[14:33] um
[14:35] and so you're seeing this you're also
[14:37] seeing like i mentioned people in the in
[14:38] the
[14:39] religious communities
[14:41] um they're also seeing this they're
[14:42] fighting back i was actually after i did
[14:46] that first um
[14:48] uh sunday school
[14:50] i was listening to some i was actually a
[14:52] baptist commentator who was talking
[14:53] about the the critical theory stuff
[14:55] coming up in the baptist church and he
[14:57] even recognized the parallels with the
[14:59] social gospel movement back in the 1900s
[15:02] everybody's seeing this stuff and and in
[15:04] the churches they're going wait a minute
[15:06] we have to save society
[15:08] right the even the muslims are saying
[15:10] they're seeing it pop up there and they
[15:11] don't want it the buddhists are saying
[15:13] that it's popping up there they don't
[15:14] want it all the denominations are
[15:15] getting attacked with this this new
[15:17] marxism it's it's communism economism
[15:20] communism attacking the country that was
[15:21] the big drive of jordan peterson stuff
[15:23] as young men you got to be you know take
[15:25] individual responsibilities so you can
[15:27] not be sucked in into the communist move
[15:29] that's sweeping the land
[15:31] and so listen what we need to do is have
[15:33] a an organization we'll unite all the
[15:36] churches
[15:37] under one under one banner
[15:40] to fight communism
[15:42] right
[15:43] there all the denominations all the
[15:45] different fates are creating inter-faith
[15:47] organizations to fight back against
[15:49] communism
[15:50] and so
[15:52] i want to read a quote
[15:55] um
[15:57] oh
[15:58] one other thing i wanted to mention
[16:00] there seems to be especially amongst the
[16:01] young men a
[16:04] i've heard a lot of social commentators
[16:06] talking about how
[16:07] they're not christian
[16:09] but they're taking their kids to church
[16:11] because they're their new parents you
[16:12] know we'll take our kids to church
[16:13] because we understand that if we give
[16:15] them christian values they won't be
[16:16] sucked into communism
[16:18] they won't be preyed upon by the stuff
[16:21] that the the critical theory that's
[16:22] being taught in schools it's
[16:25] you know there it's it is a political
[16:28] move
[16:29] disguised as a as a religious one okay
[16:33] the but it's just going the other
[16:34] direction and so it seems to me what i'm
[16:37] seeing is you're seeing young people
[16:39] going well we don't want to be part of
[16:40] this so we're going to go join the
[16:41] church we don't really believe in god
[16:43] but we do
[16:44] want christian values we do want the
[16:46] structure that the church brings
[16:49] and so
[16:50] um
[16:52] i want to read this this this uh quote
[16:55] um this is from end time evangelism
[16:58] it says
[16:59] but it's america we could go back and
[17:01] show that right here that it's supposed
[17:03] to be in this nation that comes up where
[17:06] there's no waters no peoples that what
[17:08] he's talking about there are no waters
[17:10] that was a reference to what we read in
[17:12] revelations chapter 17.
[17:14] um
[17:15] comes up like a lamb got two little
[17:18] horns civil and ecclesiastical power but
[17:20] they unite together through political
[17:22] powers a new president we got bringing
[17:24] in rome again
[17:27] i want anybody to tell me any theologian
[17:30] here or anywhere else where the bible
[17:32] ever predicts that communism will rule
[17:35] the world
[17:36] don't you fear communism
[17:38] there's nothing to it it's a bogus thing
[17:40] that god is using to chase the nations
[17:42] with it
[17:43] chasing them chasing the nation sure the
[17:45] bible says rome will rule the world look
[17:47] at king and king nebuchadnezzar
[17:50] his dream his vision daniel's
[17:52] interpretation how every one of them
[17:54] kingdoms and dispensations hit just
[17:56] perfect and right down to the end there
[17:57] was rome so it's
[17:59] going to be rome
[18:01] it isn't going to be communism they're
[18:03] just figureheads that's all they'll
[18:05] never go nowhere
[18:07] no they won't
[18:08] so
[18:10] when i'm looking at the way things are
[18:12] going
[18:12] on one hand we could see that okay maybe
[18:14] things are going off in in this
[18:16] direction of sort of this neo-marxist
[18:18] agenda
[18:19] and
[18:20] you know i'm no prophet but personally i
[18:22] think that the devil's playing chess not
[18:25] checkers and he's giving the whole world
[18:27] something to be so scared of
[18:30] giving all the religious people of the
[18:31] world something to be terrified of so
[18:33] they'll run from the communists right
[18:35] into the arms of the pope
[18:36] right you're seeing
[18:38] um young
[18:39] sort of the the
[18:41] half the country is so scared of because
[18:44] once you get down into
[18:45] the whole gender theory stuff you get
[18:47] into things like um map if you ever hear
[18:49] that acronym stands for minor attracted
[18:51] persons this is a fancy uh
[18:54] i'll say propaganda term that basically
[18:56] means a pedophile um
[18:58] where they're they're merging which
[19:01] if you pay attention to that that um
[19:04] that title i read for that academic
[19:06] paper at the end of it is beyond the
[19:08] injury of development
[19:10] okay they're
[19:12] wanting to introduce
[19:14] sexual activity to children
[19:16] right because it's part of their
[19:18] political agenda right
[19:20] so
[19:21] this is you're seeing this merger there
[19:24] where you you now have a bunch of
[19:25] republicans going oh we got to save the
[19:27] kids we got to save the kids from this
[19:29] this this ideology that crushes anyone
[19:32] who stands against it and and might
[19:34] abuse them
[19:36] sexually so we're going to run to the
[19:37] catholic church
[19:40] what
[19:42] right good job escaping the frying pan
[19:44] folks um
[19:46] the
[19:47] this is
[19:48] the point is both of them end in the
[19:50] exact same thing they're both
[19:53] will both crush you in the end for
[19:54] dissension they both end up destroying
[19:57] the innocence of children they both have
[19:59] the same spirit because they're both run
[20:00] by the same devil right it's the devil
[20:03] playing both sides that's all it is it's
[20:06] the gospel of the evil age is
[20:07] realistically it's just anything that
[20:09] turns your head from the actual gospel
[20:11] right it's anything that's going to give
[20:13] you
[20:15] oh okay so you have you have a
[20:16] particular political leaning oh you
[20:18] think that um we need to have all sort
[20:20] of you know the the acceptance movement
[20:21] and and all the social activism and sort
[20:24] of the woke movement okay the devil's
[20:25] got good news for you
[20:27] okay because that's what the gospel
[20:28] means it's good news
[20:30] we've got good news for you there's a
[20:31] there's a church there's an organization
[20:32] that'll accept that if you want if you
[20:34] hate that you want to turn the other
[20:36] direction well the devil's got good news
[20:37] for you too
[20:38] right
[20:40] it's it's all
[20:41] just
[20:45] there's there's a it's a lie in both
[20:47] directions and it ends in the same
[20:49] catastrophe right
[20:52] but
[20:55] where does that leave us right
[20:57] because we don't want either side of
[20:58] that
[20:59] we're not part of this
[21:01] we're not
[21:02] we're not here for the devil's good news
[21:05] we understand that we do have good news
[21:08] we have actual good news
[21:10] right huh
[21:12] you've heard the term the sensation
[21:13] sweeping the nation well we have the
[21:15] sensation rejected by every nation
[21:18] nobody wants it and it's the one thing
[21:19] they all need
[21:21] right
[21:23] and
[21:26] is it is you know so satan has his
[21:28] gospel for this evil age but we have
[21:31] also a gospel for this age
[21:33] right it's it's um i wish i had i
[21:36] forgot to put the the rest of that that
[21:38] quote that i read in there but brother
[21:40] branham goes on to talk about how
[21:42] it'll get dark at the end time and the
[21:44] end time message will be perfect for
[21:46] that it'll be the end time message will
[21:48] be catered specifically to the end time
[21:51] darkness
[21:52] it won't be we won't need um uh some new
[21:56] thing because it's the same gospel is
[21:58] the gospel of this age because of the
[22:00] gospel of every age before it was the
[22:01] gospel when
[22:04] there was nothing but in the universe
[22:06] but
[22:08] a thought
[22:09] right and it'll still be the gospel when
[22:11] there's nothing left but dustin echoes
[22:13] right it'll still it's it's a timeless
[22:15] gospel it's an eternal gospel right
[22:18] and so we can
[22:20] we can say with with a certainty that we
[22:22] have good news and it is our duty to
[22:26] not just uh sit on that
[22:29] spread it as far and wide as we can the
[22:31] people if anyone is going to escape
[22:34] i mean i i was i put down you know if i
[22:37] could sum up what is the gospel in a in
[22:39] a sentence just like so many people
[22:42] before you would say john 3 16 right
[22:45] that's the gospel it's the good news
[22:46] that
[22:48] god so loved the world
[22:50] that you know and not i mean you think
[22:52] the world it's a tiny little speck an
[22:54] insignificant speck in the grand cosmos
[22:56] why did god love that in particular it's
[22:58] a you know they took pictures from space
[23:00] and there's this great speech by sagan
[23:02] who said oh it's a little blue dot that
[23:03] all of humanity is summed up in that
[23:05] tiny little speck insignificant spec
[23:08] well why did god love that world so much
[23:11] that he decided to die for it
[23:14] right what was it about that
[23:16] insignificant little dust mote
[23:19] that was so
[23:20] special
[23:22] because
[23:24] there was people there who would believe
[23:27] right there was people there
[23:30] who would not perish you don't have to
[23:32] perish with
[23:34] the gospel of the critical fears you
[23:37] don't have to perish with the gospel of
[23:38] of the catholicism and the and the and
[23:42] all the the myriad of denominations that
[23:44] spawned from it
[23:45] right
[23:46] there's there's there is good news that
[23:49] you don't have to
[23:51] um
[23:52] remain
[23:53] part of this
[23:55] train wreck that's going to go up in
[23:56] flames there is a way out and the way
[23:59] out is to not be associated with any of
[24:00] it to understand that
[24:03] we're not
[24:05] we're not uh condemned to
[24:08] this
[24:09] false choice you don't have to choose
[24:11] either side
[24:12] right too many people and i mean
[24:15] i'm probably a little too invested in
[24:17] politics myself and it's too tempting
[24:19] to
[24:20] see all the all the the the
[24:24] communism that pops up today and gets
[24:26] all up in arms about it and all been out
[24:27] of shape and oh it's such a travesty
[24:29] well it is a travesty it's wrong but
[24:30] that doesn't mean that you should also
[24:32] get caught up in the other side either
[24:34] right they're both a trap and the gospel
[24:37] is the good news of this age is that
[24:40] there is a third option
[24:42] right there's the god option and
[24:46] to understand that this world is not our
[24:48] home
[24:48] it is we're not from here
[24:51] we're not going to stay here we're going
[24:52] back to where we came from
[24:55] and uh
[24:56] that
[24:57] i suppose
[24:59] is the gospel
[25:01] and um
[25:02] i guess we're gonna actually
[25:05] end it there about three minutes early
[25:07] than what we're supposed to so and you
[25:09] can
[25:10] spend a little more time
[25:12] uh enjoying yourselves thank you so much
[25:15] and um we'll stand and have a word of
[25:16] prayer
[25:19] dear lord thank you for this opportunity
[25:21] to share what you've given me to the
[25:22] people ask that would bless the people
[25:24] and that it wouldn't just be my words or
[25:26] my ideas but that it would have it would
[25:29] help the people to to recognize the day
[25:31] that they live in and that they would be
[25:34] able to
[25:35] take this and apply it to where they
[25:37] live and and and and walk
