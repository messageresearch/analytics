really hard amen praise God Hebrews chapter 12 amen and I want to um I think I told the booth we're going to begin at verse 25 that' be the best place Hebrews 12 25 you have it say Amen see that ye refuse not him that speaketh for if they escaped not who refused him that spake on Earth much much more shall we not Escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from Heaven amen whose voice then shook the Earth but now he hath promised saying yet once more I shake not the Earth only but also heaven and this word yet once more signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken as of things that are made that those things which cannot be shaken May remain amen so when when the world is finished shaken only God's family will be left standing amen wherefore we receive a kingdom which cannot be moved thank God let us have Grace whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear for our God is a consuming fire I can tell he wants all of you and he'll either you'll either allow him to be Lord of all or he is not going to be willing to be Lord at all and uh you know I was just listening um before coming to church and sister Debbie and I were listening to a tape there and that I'm using tonight in this sermon number of statements from IT world falling apart where brother brandham said you've got to meet his conditions if you want him to meet your needs so you can't expect him to just you know you've heard me say before he ain't a vending machine right he's not Santa Claus see so it's not you know get in a crisis drop few quarters and say Lord I need some Deliverance if you I I first of all I want more than 75 cent worth of Deliverance I want I want I'm I'm like Ruth I don't want just a few handfuls I want the whole field I want all the possession amen so I'm certainly uh greedy in that way and uh I want everything that the Lord has for me amen let's bow our heads father we thank you for this service tonight and I ask for your divine blessing Lord as I just have spent Lord the entire day pondering this thought and Lord and putting it together in my mind and walking it through the scriptures and the things your Prophet said Lord we want to be sure that we have your exact mind for tonight uh so Lord I just commit myself into your hands right readily right now and ask you to take complete control of the service and I will just rest in that Assurance commit it to you in Jesus name amen God bless you friends you can be seated amen and amen excuse me and get all my uh ducks in a row here get everybody cooperating amen [Music] tonight I'm going to deviate from my series that I thought all week that I would probably get back to um but uh yesterday what are you doing machine yesterday um it was either yesterday or the day before very early in the morning the Lord dropped a a different thought in my heart and I I'm I'm I'm calling it competing Powers now I almost decided to call it a false Messiah but I figured with the events of of last night and today that would be like clickbait so I decided not to get accused of using a title uh that would be clickbait for U um people watching on YouTube and plus you'd think if I did that you'd think that I was going to preach on the Donald tonight but I'm not I'm not actually at all um I'm I'm going to use the events because they are epic events of what happened last night as a as a side note or more as what they would call a footnote but I got this burden before a day and a half maybe at least before anyone knew the outcome of any kind of election and it was uh down to the wires what they were saying it would be it would be very close it ended up not being and I think that's providential as well so the last thing that I'm interested in doing tonight is stepping up and and giving a political speech amen we're here for the word of God so but but it does bring us to a reality of competing powers in this day now let me kind of cut to the chase a little bit and take you into the message that brother brandom said and this might be getting ahead of myself it's okay it's the way I feel led to do it brother brandham comes just um uh later on in 1963 after he's preached the seals and some very uh amazing sermons and he comes to the end of 1963 just like we're coming to the end of 2024 hard to believe but he preaches a message called the world is falling apart later on he would take the message the world is again falling apart so obviously the Lord had quite a bit in these sermons that that we needed to get our minds around and in the first his first run with it in the world is falling apart in November the 15th uh 1963 brother brandham actually will contrast Alexander the Great with the Lord Jesus Christ amen and he will point out how in that sermon how that and you understand now why I'm starting with this because I remember my title is competing Powers all right and so he he contrast how that Alexander was a great you know lived uh many many years prior many centuries you know prior uh to Christ coming on the scene this was the the beginning of the rise of the Grecian Empire it would be many centuries later before that would diminish and the Roman EMP Empire would come on the scene who were in power at the time of the Lord Jesus amen and so we find then that many centuries separated their lives but brother brandham draws a contrast between both of them as conquerors yeah amen and ironically or not so much ironically because personally and this is just brother Jason I I wonder if the Lord didn't do it exactly on purpose uh to to show exactly the contrast between a World Conqueror who would who would start out his life as a prohibitionist but then who would become decadent in his power because when you have absolute power but you have no character that becomes evil that's a recipe for evil and so we realize then that when you when you take you can look down through history every despot that ever lived every Tyrant that every live that ever lived gained tremendous power but had no character and so it becomes satanic in other words not the person becomes Satan but that person leans into uh the the Fallen nature that they're born with and Satan ends up with all of that power Satan ends up with it see now I want you to understand a great principle that we would not have known had had brother brandham not given us this insider trading knowledge this top secret spiritual military uh inside knowledge and that is this and the devil didn't want anyone to know it but a prophet declared it and put it on a tape and I heard it amen prise God and now it can't be taken back that's right and he says this that a demon is almost powerless unless he can find somebody to work through see so a demon all by himself although he has brother brandom talks about how that Satan conjured up that storm he is the prince of the power of the air don't imagine he doesn't have any power he's got real power brother bradam when he was there in that big tent meeting and those witch doctors came in and he said they sat down and they began turning their cutting their feathers and turning them and saying father son Holy Ghost father son and actually using Three Holy words a as it were uh from the word of God and Conjuring a storm said we'll conjure a storm that'll blow this tent away and brother brandham said believe it or not the storm came yeah just like Jesus asleep in the boat and the demons swore this is our chance let's kill him and so they begin to stir the winds and the waves so it's not that Satan doesn't have any power say but I thought Jesus stripped him of all of his power understand that that Satan is equal to Christ except in creation what he's lacking is authority over you amen so he is in effect powerless unless you give him Authority so his only weapon against you not the world look it's obvious that he's the God of this evil age by the popular demand long before any politician won a vote Satan had already won the vote of the population of the Earth and he's now worshiped as the god of the age and so we realize then that that he doesn't he doesn't have any authority over you and I everything that all of his interaction with God's family anything that we go through as we've said before Satan must get permission from our heavenly father but now remember there's also the side of this that he might come to you and say you know I need you know you should do this and tempt you to do it and you might do it and then try to say the devil made me do it and brother brandham says no right he never because you were sealed into Christ and he couldn't get to you he said you stepped out to himen you stopped and listened to reasoning and then because you became a participant a co conspirator then you say well why did the Lord let me get punished I'm here to tell you you brought it on yourself see so when your when things like your prayer life your church attendance your fellowship when those things wne and the devil is able to use his very simple tactic it's astonishing how much success he has with this over God's family he uses a very simple out of the-box tactic called distraction and he just fills up your life with distraction oh yeah amen and he'll fill up your life with digital distraction and career distractions and and and entertainment distractions and Recreation distractions and and any one of them or all of them and and we just almost like the the children who followed the P Piper we just like follow along like we're hypnotized and then we come to our senses and we go oh Lord Jesus forgive me and he will because if we confess our sins he's faithful and just to forgive us amen but we understand that we bring so many consequences that maybe God didn't have planned for you he's aware of it and he will help you in your time of need but come on can we just own our own involvement sometimes friends that this whole power struggle you know is is really as brother brandham said it's it's for it's God and Satan vying for control of your mind amen cuz if Satan can control your mind he can control your actions control the minds of the of the people you'll control their actions that's a well-known uh trick that governments use and politicians use win the hearts and minds of the people where you think that came from amen see God's design is to win your hearts and Minds Satan's design is to win your hearts and Minds we go into an we go into an enemy Nation we what are we trying to do win their hearts and Minds only we go about it wrong instead of bringing them the the gospel that could really change their nature we just give them money and all kinds of things and they end up hating us even more right so brother brandham talks about how that Alexander You Know by the time he's 33 he's an alcoholic there's history records about 7 to 8,000 probably I think brother Bram used the the word the the the number 7,000 that's pretty close historically uh it's there it's somewhat subjective I'll take it but there were 7,000 prostitutes following his army right right this was one of the things that Jon of Arc you know got rid of you know when she was being used for God used by God in France she said we've got to get rid of these things it's the only way we can have the blessing of God and and she wasn't wrong so so we find then that by the time he's 33 he has conquered the known world conquered everything that they knew about that was worth anything there was still lands they know he wasn't on on he wasn't in North America wasn't even know understood you know by his armies but everything that was worth conquering he had conquered and then he died at 33 Conquering the known world that had any value but the contrast was that Jesus look here's here's the thing to get they both died at 33 and one of them is still dead but one of them came back to life and when he ascended on high he conquered death hell the grave Heaven Earth the universe he conquered everything at 33 I'll take that leader to me that power has already conquered my heart and my mind I hope you're here tonight and you're not still playing the the game of of of competing Powers I want to tell you something today don't don't don't give don't let this be a competition give your whole heart and mind to the Conqueror who conquered everything is still alive and is still in control brother brandham and here is where I'm trying to come down now to I want to try to go quickly because it's a Wednesday and brother brandham talks about it in a number of places he says here and this is a little sooner than a little before a few months before the world falling apart this is in July of 63 and I've only got some highlighted Spots I'm going to read that's why I didn't put them up because I didn't want to get slowed down with with whole quotes but I just want to read some Snippets brother brandham says we are at the end time there is not one hope left now this is by this is just July 1963 amen and we know that 1956 ended the call to America and by the time the sun rose on January 1 1957 America as a nation had rejected God and crossed the line and judgment was pronounced upon her and she has declined ever since amen now it's not about oh well her GDP is up her Army has conquered this it's not about that like brother brandham said sure he said anytime you denominate said the Holy Spirit leaves it God puts it on a shelf and he said and he said and then I'll ask any historian show me any church that ever denominated if it didn't die right there but then he concedes the fact because it's a pointless fact he says you say oh well but we've increased our numbers he said sure of course you've increased your numbers that's not the point you could quadruple you could go grow 10 times a 100 times over your numbers but if God has left that organization then all you have is dead people and and worse than dead you have no way to bring red Redemption because the light that brings Redemption has already moved on and the only hope that anyone has in that past movement is to hear the draw is to let the sunlight draw them out of there and follow after the light just like you your brother M says you pour concrete over it and the grass will grow out sideways and come up along the edges no matter what you do it's reaching up for the Sun and in every age and including this age there was a number of people in a dark day who the sun rose and they have ever since that day been reaching up for the sun I'm reaching up for it tonight friends I don't want to live one day without it the warmth of its raise it's life-giving raise so he's already declaring we're at the end time there is not one hope left we cannot build bu Upon This Nation this nation is based on politics politics is finished yes amen half the nation is having a big Jubilee party yeah the other half of the half the nation is is in their whiskey celebrating another half is in their whiskey crying what a miserable State of Affairs the this world is not my home I'm just passing through Hallelujah politics is finished yes he says on here in the world falling apart every so often the world gets in such a chaotic condition until there is this is a strong statement until there is nothing can help it yeah amen it's already gone so now won't at this point now we're not talking about what God can do because God has already it's already crossed a line for God to help it so now all it's got is its science and its politics it's government and its Army and its money suppose it so so he says and the and the and the truth of it is and history proves it once it goes beyond God's mercy then nothing can help it and it'll just Decline and Decline and Decline and so he says we've had that this several times these preludes he calls them we find that each time when it meets this condition and it causes people to start praying and they feel that everything has played itself out and all of our systems and everything that we have play itself to the end politics and other things things just comes to its end there is no more to it and I think all that's done by God he says and I think all that's done by God for a purpose to kind of rejuvenate a kind of bringing back it has a way of renewing itself now civilization has done that down through time one civilization Rises up and then it fades out in another one replaces it the the bottom line is people Humanity has managed to just keep finding new civilizations they've managed to just get new countries they managed to just keep going and the whole thing has become Global and and the world thinks well we've survived you know world wars we've survived everything looks like we're we we all we've got to do is try to build a secure future but what they don't realize is is that the last Nation all of those the reason it kept going forward is because it had to get to the last Nation the sun had to get all the way to the to the west and that has happened and now that nation has rejected it now there's no more Super Nations to come there is a superpower but it ain't a nation see certainly not politics in the traditional sense so he he goes on to say everything has just played itself to the end politics and other things just come to its end it's kind of a re a rejuvenating a renewing of itself and he says it like this it's just a law of God see amen so brother brother Matt has preached uh there from the uh Church age book about the you know the whole thing of of Revival and death and that cycle of Revival and death and we've seen it go all the way down through time brother brandham comes into this day the scripture is fulfilled now this is 1965 I'm jumping near to the end of his ministry and he says Jesus referring back to the day that we are living in right now this day right now see rich leoda and yet rotten in politics yes Church politics amen see National politics amen just as rotten as it could be and then he said as it was in the days of thought so shall it be in the coming end time notice what he said there in the day when the son of man will be revealed now we have the son of man the day of the son of man revealed again th this is exactly why I was so appreciating brother brother Joe Adams sermon from Sunday because he he took such such pains and cares and time to explain how that you know that he said we're not talking about isua get isua out of your mind he said when we say we're going back to Pentecost we're not talking about isua that was just one of a four-stage plan that God had to restore the brid tree there was justification sanctification the isua Revival which brother Ram said just brought a little more power that was missing in the church and it it it amped things up and some gifts started to flow again and some more power started to turn loose it was not the long awaited restoration that would put fruit in the top of the tree because because it proved it wasn't CZ it denominated just like Luther did just like Wesley did the Asuza fathers denominated so when brother brandham says that you can't mix Pentecost with this message he's certainly not talking about the upper room experience he's talking about what the azuza Revival became and that's true you can't mix because it denominated and that's exactly why people have tried people who claim the message people who preach the message and have had denominational spirits and you can't mix that kind of a spirit with the message cuz it's not a dead letter it's a living God it's a person of Christ the the message has is not and has never been books and tapes and quotes that's just a vehicle that God used but the message is a person of the word it's Christ now living inside of his people and brother brandham talks about how that that's why this is a restoration as brother Joe would say he said Sunday people say oh we have the revealed word don't lose sight of the fact please that the re that the Revelation the revealed word the Revelation that we have is a restored word that it has restored us back to the original faith of the fathers it has taken us back that's why brother brandham said that first age that Alpha age they had the Jubilee they had the abstract title they had that was the token was there that was the continuation of the ministry of Jesus Christ where they had not only the office of a son of man like we had in our day but they had the ministry of the son of man because an office is a prophet but the ministry is the word made flesh and that's where brother Bram says it was once again the word like in Christ in one man walking the shores of Galilee now the word was made flesh in an entire body on the earth starting at Jerusalem and moving out to Judea and Samaria and to the uttermost part of the earth and then that went down in the ages and has been brought back in this hour and so we've been restored back to the original faith of the fathers that's a perfect Faith because that's the mind of Christ see so so we find in that the fact that here we are with the restored word that's been revealed in this day and that's why that's why only the bride can see it because the the the the rest of the world outside of election can only believe what they read and can study a student comparing verse with verse but the bride the elect lady is not limited by what she can read and understand in reading or Scholastics but but to her she while the world understands what it can read the bride understands what has been revealed so it's not just something you read but something got revealed to [Applause] you you say well how do you know that it was the word revealed because it turns the reader and the believer and the person revealed into the image of this book it causes you to love God it causes you to hate sin it causes you to re say Amen to every word and not try to second guess it it causes you to not only receive but to accept and pursue the power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost amen so he goes on in the anointed ones at the end time he says he says he says here and he reads the scripture there from from the gospels for there shall arise Matthew 24 false Christ and false prophets talking about at the very last day and he says a Believer knows that we are now at the end of the history of the world Amen say well goodness that was 70 years ago that a that's just minutes and seconds to God that's nothing see we've been here 2,000 years Einstein proved that difference in time relativity see and so to to what has been two 20 centuries to us to God just a couple days see so we're told that in the last days and brother Brandon would say the last 2,000 years he says now believer a Believer knows that we are now at the end of the history of the world there will be no use of writing it didn't say they wouldn't just said it ain't going to serve a lot of purpose there' be no use of writing it because there won't be anybody to read it it's at the end of the time just when I do not know just how long it would be not even the angels of heaven knows that minute or that hour so he's talking about politics have come to their end this is 1960s society's at an end history is at an end now I I I I came across an article by a a very astute woman very smart actually I'm I subscribed to her Channel because of my fascination with physics and science but her name of course is Sabine hossenfelder she's wellknown she's a theoretical physicist she's a science Communicator she explores the role most often of of aesthetic criteria in the development of physical theories and argues and here's her main argument that that because that physics and I'm just going to give you the the short version it's a whole book she wrote a fantastic book called Lost in the math and she has many YouTube um about this she's held in some derision by physicists because she they don't want her telling what she's telling but she's a brilliant woman she's German and and um she says that that physics has just done nothing in the last 50 years that caught my attention because I remembered brother brandham saying science has come to its end politics come to its end the Earth's come to its end and here she's admitting that we've done nothing she says now oh I know you're going to say well we've developed string theory and we've developed chaos and we've developed you know um all you know all of these different positions and and all kinds of quantum physics she said yeah yeah yeah yeah that's true she says but it's all just beautiful Theory she said we we haven't we haven't substantially proven any of it right in the last half century amen wow and it it caught my mind because I remember it's like for instance you can take today one of our great minds is Elon Musk and his goal is a moon colony and then on to Mars now you say Do you think that can happen I do not the reason I do not do do I think they could eventually do that absolutely but from the Tree of knowledge of Good and Evil if they didn't run out of time just like brother Brenham says Luther would have came to this message but he died he ran out of time he couldn't he didn't live long enough Wesley would have become it but he didn't live long enough you see so they will but they won't live long enough because we've already reached the end of Politics the end of history and now even top physicists are saying we really reached the end of of scientific development and we've done nothing but guess at things amen and and and another thing and and when I think about musk saying oh we're going to have a moon Colony we're going to go to Mars when I look back at a prophet's seven visions and they covered different things they covered social trends they covered politics they covered you know the the the women and the and the and the morals and things like that they covered World War and different nations and powers and brother bram's prophecies have just hit with stunning accuracy Amen to the to the Limit that the only one remaining unfulfilled is he said I heard a terrific explosion and I turned and as far as I could see across the landscape of America just smoldering debris and ruin and blown to Pieces yes amen and you say well what is that going to be anything it would be as speculative and and I'll just say I don't know but that's okay cuz I plan to be somewhere else lot's children have to deal with that not Abraham's children I know that when we come back we walk out on the ashes of the wicked and that seems to be what brother Brenham saw just ashes just smoldering said as far as I could see just nothing but blown up places and smoking and and just like there had been a TR terrific and we preached here some time ago you know on just the destructive power of a one Megaton nuclear bomb and it took our breath away the destructive power of just one just a one Megaton and so so we when when I look at all of his categories one of the categories he dealt with was science yeah and and invention and the last thing he saw in the in the progression of scientific achievement was the driverless car that had no steering wheel and going down super highways under its own power we I mean and they've had that car and that whole concept for decades but now you are living in the days of the implementation of that yeah amen and we're literally they've already got I was just in Phoenix it shocked me I'd heard that Phoenix was one of the big cities of weo and everywhere I go there's wayo Cars Moving and no no driver in it and they're and they're now releasing in cars that have no steering wheel and you just get in it and the family faces each other exactly according to brother Brandon's Vision he didn't see Moon colonies and he didn't see us getting to Mars he saw what we are seeing right now I'm here to tell you look up because your Redemption draw n and in fact as I saw another article just today and and and I I don't know if I'm pronouncing this right but it's it's uh uh parthenogenesis and it's actually they now have this article because now they're forced to discuss the ethical and scientific question surrounding the creation of human embryos without the use of of of egg or sperm from the man or the woman that it's completely uh generated from stem cells alone and and so now there's this big ethical question well is that a human and it's actually the cell is developing DNA and starting to develop and they're they're stopping it because they say if this grows into a person and and they make it very clear we're not we're not trying to grow a baby we're just trying to understand creation and life I'm here to tell you they've reached the maximum and your Redemption is soon friends science is admitting they have not actually been developing they've got theories and you know the thing that that that that Sabine points out in this caught my mind she said the reason that the scientific community in in physics has stalled with definitive proof of all of these theories is because these theories have been focused on beauty and it's all mathematical Beauty and they want to make it so so eloquent and so elaborate and oh it's just beautiful and they get mesmerized cuz they can line it all up mathematically and it's a beautiful thing and I thought to myself that's exactly what Cain did he went after Beauty that's exactly what brother bradam said the problem was with the churches they want Beauty Satan lives in Beauty and it has and that's why politics has come to an end that's why science is maxed out that's why we're almost home I'm here to tell you something friends don't bother writing history books there won't be soon anyone to read it but there will be a recording of This Bride on the the other side and there will be a hall of history of the great warriors of the faith and I want to see your name there in my name there that we survive Leo toia hallelujah amen so he goes on down just want to catch a few more of these so you find then that he brother Brenham and the exposition of the seven Church ages in the resume he makes this statement right now the church is plural amen that are controlling politics he's talking about churches churches plural that are controlling politics and he says that's happening right now amen now it's no secret I don't think anyone would would deny that it is churches who put Donald Trump in office yes that's right because that he had enough if he didn't have the Conservative Christian Movement so-called he would have never even probably won the Primary right because the man has made so many statements and actions that are so egregious to human intelligence and as I said to you last time I'm not Prejudice I hate both of them that's a joke of course I I I hope let the Lord to get a hold of their lives somehow and and but I know this that God is in control say who's going to win the election and we and we were all saying it come on we were we were saying whoever God has picked it's not going to be the world is going to have an election they're going to spend gazillions of dollars on it and people are going to get on and Talking Heads are going to argue and fight over it you're going to have a pre-election and election and a postelection and this thing's going to go on for years and they're already figuring out 2028 I'm here to tell you God already knows who the 10 a gold president would be who the one we're replacing the one we're getting the next one if there's a next one I'm just so glad we know who is in control so he says he calls them churches now of course these are the ones that he had he had that's in the resume because he had already the resume is a resume of all of them and backing up going to the th tyon age you remember we've read it before where brother Brenham deals with that in the Book of Revelation chapter 3 and he speaks to the churches and we've read this before brother Brenham says in the th tyan Church age now why does he call these churches his churches even though they are the false Vine the truth of the matter is that they are Christians but they are not Christians of the spirit they are Christians of the flesh they are bearing the name so brother br said they're they they and he goes on and I've read it before they they appreciate the the fine qualities of Jesus see yeah I don't have that one but it's okay and and so so they subscribe to the fact that Jesus is the son of God born of a virgin can't died to save Sinners died to save the world every bit of that's true every bit of that's true but that's just the letter of truth that's that's not the spirit that therefore he says they're not Christians of the spirit they are Christians of the flesh because they can read about it and in this book and in other books and discover the history of what Jesus of Nazareth did and subscribed to the Fine qualities of his life and they've built churches and by this time now we've got north of 33,000 north of that 33,000 differ interpretations of the Gospel amen amen so take your pick you know pick one get in line somewhere I'm glad that I've got the original one Hallelujah and so so we find then he says they do bear the name but Jesus warned the Earth in the seventh chapter of the Gospel of Mark in the seventh verse how be it in vain see they do bear the name but how be it in vain do they worship me teaching for doctrines the Commandments of men he doesn't say in vain do they they worship me because they're bad people he says they they're they worship me in vain because they're not following the word of the hour and what they're doing is is they follow the Commandments of men and there's nothing in here that's a commandment of a man this is the this is a book written by God himself see and so as soon as you start getting an ad mixture of man-made Theory then you it's all it's all it becomes mongrelized at that point and I'm here to tell you that was never going to bring the ministry of the son of man back to the people it's going to have to take a complete restoration of the word and not just the word but the life inside the word the spirit would have to Fallen amen so he says you know we are living in the end time it's a statement you know we are living in the end time it is in this age that the churches are going to come together and as they are even now controlling World politics it's still churches see amen they are controlling World politics they will soon control the finances of the world then if you don't belong to the world organization of churches you won't be able to buy nor sell now at that point we're gone yes amen so then we're somewhere between that that and they are even now controlling World politics they will soon control the finances so we're somewhere between they're in control of world politics but they can't enforce except you by yourself because the bride is still here so we're we're just right in the in right in there where that comma is you understand friends that's what it's come down to we've come down and everything has come to an end and the next event can't come until we're gone Hallelujah and then when we're gone you're going to then he says he says now those those of the of the unwise Virgin is who he's speaking of he says you will lose all those who stay true to God so because there will be yes amen now if there's if there's people in the tribulation who stay true to God then it often obviously meant they were already true to God as far as as they knew that they were true righteous people who were living as best they understood now they're obviously not the bride because they're in the tribulation so you understand the world is filled with good people who are who are not they're not about what I'm about to read listen to this description those who stay true to God and keep their garments clean from the defilement of this world system of church ERS will be physically bereft those are the ones that'll get hunted down like dogs and killed now I always wondered how is that going to work um because how would the Constitution of the United States allow people to be killed for their religious belief and I I knew it was in the word I could see it in the Book of Revelation I just thought man there must just be such a throwing down of the Constitution and brother Brandon was saying already in the we don't even have a constitution anymore they they've just they've they've been breaking it and all it does is get worse and worse every year so now you when you think about it in those terms you realize that that that when you and and here here's something I just saw recently you know that Donald Trump took in Robert Kennedy took in RFK yeah right and so he he took in uh Bobby Kennedy I guess would be his son or maybe it's nephew thank you yeah and so one of the things that he and I heard it with my own ears he was at at one of the political speeches and he was saying that the that the current Administration he was just blasting his own Democratic um um people and so he was saying and he called them by name Biden and Kamala have have found he said they have just pushed through a law for the very first time in American history and I thought wow this is RFK I'm gonna pay attention to what he's about to say and they've got it now and it's already on the books and ready to be enforced and the law simply states that in times of national crisis anyone who publicly speaks against the government it can be put in prison yeah and completely confined to prison I'm here to tell you something friends it won't take much more after that to just put them to death and brother bradam said they will be hunted down like dogs oh hide me in the cleff of the rock oh I'm so glad for a message that's going to take me out of here before that day amen so he says they will be physically bere now watch this now he's going to talk about those who are Miss the Rapture but who are not living they're that they're just Christians of the flesh watch this there will be a great there will be presented to them a great temptation to give in Preachers will give in with the excuse that they will serve God within the framework of the Antichrist Beast system because the option is close your doors and don't be a church anymore so they will reason that well I'll operate within the framework of the Antichrist Beast system they will will give in to the flatteries and blandishments of the hierarchy and the people will follow these false Shepherds right into the slaughter but in the Judgment they will be found naked they will not be given those white robes amen the foolish virgin will get white robes and that's not you they wash their robes in the blood of the Lamb that's not the bride it's the foolish virgin who wash their robes in the blood of the Lamb because as far as the bride brother brandham said you are the blood of God by the spirit we don't have to wash our robes I've already passed from Death to life I already have the righteousness of Christ upon my life but those unwise virgin will stay true and they are holy people they're Holiness people they're righteous people as best they understand as best they understand the word of God they're sincere are Sav from destruction amen and they'll be granted eternal life they'll be given white robes they'll wash their robes in the blood of the lamb but brother brandham is saying that the rest which is the majority in the Judgment they will be found naked they will not be given those white robes neither will they walk with him you can't walk in spotted garments of the world holding hands with the devil here and then expect to be with God can I say that again you can't be found in the world holding hands with the devil here and expect to be with God you cannot live here and hold hands with the devil and expect to live with God you understand friends you cannot live here and hold hands with the devil and expect to live with God that's never going to happen so so now so then and of course this makes sense to me this whole thing I thought about it and why I got to close this whole thing makes sense to to me because when brother brandham is talking about his day and even to this day right at this moment the churches are in control of politics yes so this makes sense because it's not yet Rome it's Rome through her daughters yes amen see amen because Rome is the Beast system that takes it all and sets up an image to the Beast and the pope is in the driver and that's where the the Book of Revelation shows that when Satan is cast out of Heaven the bride goes up Satan is cast down he incarnates the false prophet which is the which will be the pope of Rome and then he become brother Bram said he becomes an incarnate devil where he's now the false prophet he's an incarnate devil but prior to that uh there's a there's a there's an image erected to the Beast which is all of the daughters building an image to the Beast amen oh my goodness friend you are to be rejoicing to say I'm so glad I can see all of this and I know how to avoid it and this is not part of my future and and why is this so relevant because the whole world is running now thinking they've got the Savior thinking it's all going to be good thinking it's all going to be fixed now we've got peace and safety right brother you know something here's here's brother Jason thinking out loud to you you good with that here is 40 years probably 45 years of studying the word of God intently and studying The Book of Revelation verse by verse about three and a half four years ago I started on online on a on a on a coast to coast it actually goes around the world a a group of teachers and I gathered and we started breaking down we started doing in a deep dive on the entire Book of Revelation verse by verse amen and and I get questions all the time I get I get calls all the time ministers calling me what how do you see this because they know that I've studied it so closely for the last several years and when I when I begin to look at how the whole thing is beginning to shape up it is not lost on me amen that sometimes we we say well there's going to have to be a big Financial collapse and then Rome that's how Rome is going to take over okay can I just point out something to you that I think about when I read the last remnants of a description of leoa she's not she's actually believes she's still rich and increased with goods and has need of nothing see so however that flips and switches and we say we yeah but but the the Rome's going to use the gold and buy it all out because they're going to make a deal with Wall Street and that's the Jews and then they're going to break the Covenant just okay great I because that's the way I see it too that's the way brother brandham saw it but even but even remember even brother brandham as a prophet when he's asked in C about that brother Brandon where in the scripture does it talk about Rome is going to make a deal with the Jews in Wall Street and then they're going to break it and brother brandham says well he said it's not in the scripture he said but but what is in the scripture causes me to conclude that that's the only thing that could happen because we do know that what the scripture does teach is that she'll rule through through uh craft and through flatteries see and so and we do see the terrible things that are coming upon the world in the tribulation they're going to I'm here to tell you don't imagine that this world is going to survive in the current sit in the current way you see it something is gonna happen and and and all I know is is right now the churches are controlling politics and they're working right in the hands of God to put whoever they need in office and and I'm here to tell you don't the whole reason I'm saying this is so you don't sit back and say I'm just going to wait till it looks like a collapse you're going to be found oh my you're going to be found missing out because this age is Rich and increased with Goods at least it thinks it is and I'm here to tell you that I'm not going to be a part of this system I don't care about the the World Order of the system I'm looking to make my home in a new world I'm looking to have Christ come among us see and so this is why this is exactly why and brother Brandon when he goes to to comes to the end of the world falling apart and and we come down to to this he comes down to this and I'm going to come to this part and I'm going to close for tonight he's dealt with Alexander and Jesus he's dealt with in this sermon World politics he's dealt with church politics amen and and now he's going to come down to speak to the true church because that's why he's there a prophet is not using his valuable limited time to try to persuade the world they're never going to be persuaded he's trying to bring the word to the elect lady now he doesn't exactly know who all she is he admits that in in in Chicago in 63 and he says Lord according to that Vision the other day talking about seeing that those little girls in the preview of the bread he said according to that Vision the other day he said I I I I I I know she's out here here he said now I don't know who she is but we're just sewing seed oh Hallelujah I'm so glad that I got a hold of some of that seed I'm so glad that it spoke to me from an inside way that's something I can't even put in words but something in here matched something in here and I said I that's what I want to be Hallelujah and so now he's going to he's going to come and try to bring some help for you and I because now he's just he's left it standing to say we're at the end politics at the end uh Church politics National politics and now we're we're realizing science is even has even limited themselves because now they've chased after Beauty yeah we find out that they're trying to create to to try to think you know is there a possibility of creating humans W without even using uh the normal me method I'm here to tell you friends it's Satan's Eden and and it's come back full circle again and you are alive and remain and it's those who are alive and I'm here to tell you I'm not just alive but I remain a Believer I remain committed to God and so he comes now he's dealt with all of that and now he comes to this he goes back to the Corinthian Church because they've got a problem they always had a problem Corinth had a terrible problem and their problem in a nutshell was balance amen they just couldn't stay balanced Paul was constantly having to correct their balance and they they were a true church they were the elect lady but they're you know they're chasing after this one and chasing after that one and this gift and that power and this tongue and this thing and and Paul's constantly having to put out Little Brush fires and try to call them around and and then and then they're they're even they're even found giving in to to powerless teaching yeah you know like brother Joe was talking about you know the the such a misunderstanding just like I was showing you the other night about brother I'm said you don't need a prayer line with perfect Faith you w need a prayer line and I showed what a silly argument that is to use that to say we shouldn't have a prayer line what a ridiculous thing to say and this bride isn't isn't babies anymore she's a mature lady she's ready for her body change and so we're not arguing over those kinds of things it when I I I spent plenty of time explaining exping why we do it and and now that I've seen how God works in it we saw it at the camp we saw it here Sunday don't come to me saying that there's no power in those things because we saw God Shake young people to the core we saw God move adults to the core and we're seeing the power of God moving and then the the the word and the word only and that one gets me the most I can't believe the imbalance that some people try to suggest that brother Brandon was meaning that's almost as ridiculous as brother brandham saying we can't mix Pentecost with the message and thinking that means the upper room experience how ridiculous that's completely ridiculous brother Brandon spends his whole time in this sermon arguing for that experience and he says that's what we need more and more in the church and he says they say well we've got the word and the word only all that means friends is that we no longer have an ad mixture we no longer have a mongrelized word we've got thus sayith the Lord we've got the word and the word only the word alone no man-made Theory it's the pure unadulterated word of God but the problem brother Bram is trying to help the church with he says he goes back to Corinthian and Paul to the Corinthian Church and he says Paul said I never come to you with the Excellency of words and wisdom of this world because you'll build your faith on that see and so during the time of Christ's first coming one of the leading problem problems we find in the in the in the early church that Paul was dealing with especially at Corinthia one of the early problems was a desire for Excellency of words see uh it was it was the Corinthians who as I said they used up so much of Paul's precious time always with problems and spiritual balance and he told the Corinthian Church I never come to you with the Excellency of words and wisdom of this world and so we realize that what he's trying to get them to understand is that the answer is not in word only I never came to you with Excellency of speech but I came to you in power and demonstration of the dynamic Spirit of the Living God listen friends that's what the Jubilee was all about you understand why they had to wait till the 50th day because the Jubilee was what had been promised all through the Old Testament God had been promising them through Millennia someday I'm going to live down inside of you I'm not just going to be above you I'm not just going to be with you but I'm not and I'm not just going to be word only I'm going to be the Living Word with Dynamic power that's going to come down into the church and the ministry of the son of man will walk the earth and it won't just be a temporary thing happening through a prophet but it's going to be an entire people who now the Holy Spirit can flow through to a dying world that's where we are friends the dynamic power of the Holy Spirit do we have the word we sure do and we thank God for it but it's not just a dead letter it's a living experience it doesn't specify any certain emotion or any certain manifestation but what it does is it'll change your heart and it'll change your mind and it'll change your walk and your talk and your entire life will be changed and that's what we want and that's why we saw a camp and that's what we saw here son Hallelujah I'm a witness of these things do you want that Bal Tabernacle is that the direction we're going in we're not going after dead letter we're not going after word with no Spirit the word and the word only is the very life of almighty God yeah if it wasn't the word and the word only you couldn't get the token amen you understand because the display here's another here's another teaching from The Book of Revelation the display of the Holy Ghost has always been parallel to the word that was revealed that's why it didn't make Luther stop drinking beer right amen but yet brother brandham said don't say he wasn't born again he certainly was don't say he didn't have the Holy Ghost he certainly did but the but the possibility of the level of experience they were that they could get access to the Token had not been seen since the days of the Jubilee in the early church when they had an abstract title and they were on their way to a Rapture now it had to be the seed had to go into the ground we know that a prophet showed us that the seed had to go into the ground but here here at the end time friends we've come Beyond Luther we've come Beyond Wesley we've come Beyond isua we've come back to the full word and the full token can now be on display and that brother brandom said is what will bring the dead for hundreds of years out of the Grave oh that's what I want to see friends I don't care about who's a president who's elected it's all going to the Beast system I just want know that that that Jesus is my king rise up to your feet friends that's what you want to pursue that's what you want to chase young person young man young woman you want to make something out of your life pursue the king hallelujah we're not here to be political activists oh this world is not my home I'm just passing through my treasures are laid up somewhere beyond the blue the Angels beckon me where from Heaven's open door because of that I can't feel at home in this world anymore am oh I love that song and we're going to have to come back to our Jubilee again that brother Tony had us jumping with praise the Lord friends list listen I the the one thing that that I so strive for and is it's Paramount to me is that we have bance in the word of God Amen an imbalance is one of the most detrimental aspects aever a real one a bonafied one born again of the spirit of God but with an imbalanced understanding and I just say Lord God let me be clear let me be understood and let me come with the word with a balanced approach believing everything a prophet said about it is that you bethl Tabernacle is that what your vision of a true church church is I'm here to tell you God confirms it God was confirming it at Camp God was confirming it Sunday God will confirm it tonight whatever your need could be God can confirm it right now Hallelujah there is nothing that can be withheld from you if you can believe it say well what's possible The Impossible that's what's Available to You by having the full word that's what's going to give you the token on display that's what's going to give you perfect Faith that's what's going to give you overcoming power and I'm here to tell you it will defeat the Devil I don't know you know when I when I look at that and I just say you know he he came in such a way that he even he even left room there in the scripture he left room for our human weaknesses amen you believe that oh yeah because it it it deals with us in general but it's not an absolute word I I I I don't want to open up my my iPad and go back to it again but God is here to bring you to every position that he saw of you before the foundation of the world and that should be your prayer say Lord bring me today this day bring me a little closer to the image you saw of me can you can you have that kind of faith can you believe he saw you before the foundation of the world if you can believe that because remember in perfect faith brother B said that's one of the there's several there's three or four five main points in one of them is you got to believe who you are you got to believe what he has said about you that you're the Spotless unadulterated Virgin Queen you're a bride of all of Christ he wouldn't have chosen you had you not been I don't know what kind of past you've had I don't know what kind of trouble you might be in but I'm here to tell you the word can call you up out of it into a higher place not just a word not just a teaching not just a Doctrine but teaching that comes with the power of the word of God am it's why I'm so glad for the ministry we got here we got a team of preachers who who teach and preach the word of God with power and demonstration of the Holy Spirit and we see it move and I'm say Lord God pour it on Hallelujah you won't that say Lord pour it on let our church go grow even higher in the spirit of God we're not trying to write a prescription on on whatever kind of sensation emotion or demonstration whatever just let God do it people people get sometimes worried I was discussing this with a brother just the other day very very sincere asking a question you know what about the gifts and I said brother brandham said write in that sermon WR in you I mean he's preaching the world is falling apart amen and in that message of all messages he's going to say the gifts operate in the church to keep the church clean yeah see that's why they operate to keep the church clean why would I be worried about gifts when we're a mature bride I understand the bride went through a babyhood she was an infant she had to grow up we we we we got it wrong many times and brother Bram talks about the Lord said you can't teach these things to Pentecostal babies well we're not Pentecostal babies anymore we were infants of the word but the bride has risen now to to a mature woman I just say Lord whatever you need to do what however you need to work let it work we're not here to put him in a box and limit anything that God can do why would I worry about it we're not immature anymore we know how we know how to how to we know the will of God brother brandham said she knows the will of God she knows what to do with the word of God amen that's who I identify as amen praise the Lord Brother Tony I want that Jubilee again all right this world is not my home this world is not my home come

we had a hurricane come and I'm glad nobody got hurt right and everything Lord just saved us from that hurricane amen praise the Lord hallelujah you sure did amen praise the Lord anybody else amen I got one I'm going to give brother Chris all right our dog we uh we have a boxer that's uh almost three and he uh he had a series of episodes throughout the last three years where he collapsed and is like a seizure or something we don't know but we took him to a specialist and he saw a heart doctor and the cardiologist said that you know he had a potentially a condition that boxers can get that they typically grow out of but they don't always and sometimes they require medicine so long story short we uh had a prayer cloth prayed over and put it on his collar a couple weeks ago and took yesterday to the cardiologist and just want to give God thanks she she said his heart's absolutely perfect God and so no condition whatsoever she said in fact his blood pumps like really good he's amazing and so I just thankful for that amen praise the Lord who you pointing that brother oh Chris there you go okay I wasn't going to give this but the sister that just spoke about the hurricane made me have to say it so um probably like a month ago a few days after Hurricane Helen um for anybody who doesn't know I'm a plumber and so me and my coworker went to a job where there was a tankless water heater that got hit by a tree and knocked it off of the the the house wall um everything was still hooked up so we were told to rehook it up or remount it to the wall anyway it all happened really fast but my cooworker wanted to see if it's still functioned because everything was hooked up and um if for anybody who doesn't know tangless water here is on demand so once you run water it automatically ignites so he hit the relief line to make water come through the heater and apparently I guess there was an internal leak well the water heater exploded in our faces oh my and it was about as loud as a cannon so it was louder than a gunshot a neighbor came and checked on us but my coworker's hand was literally on the heater as it exploded and I was standing right beside him and we left unscathed untouched praise the Lord thank the Lord for that amen praise the lord lord watches out for his people amen and he work he he he he favors your co-workers if you happen to be standing near them amen praise the Lord anybody else before we go tonight all right so coming into church so sister Debbie and I were driving and you know we were we always say oh my goodness once the clocks go back then we got to drive to church in the dark and it's just a whole different thing and then it was rain training and so we're driving and so we were excited to be at church to get here sing songs clap our hands and enjoy the presence of God so we're pulling leaving s Point Road go across the intersection and I'm headed up with you know Publix on this side and and U Wells Fargo on this side and right as I'm picking up speed I'm probably at 40 45 miles an hour and a car comes like leaving Publix or the the road up above it and he comes in and he's going to do that thing where he gets in in the middle and then waits for traffic to clear except he didn't wait in the middle and he decided to not wait in the middle when I'm 3 feet coming by him he's doing 10 miles hour and I'm doing 45 and there's an F-150 right on my I got a wingman right here and and it all it's all like choreographed it's all just happening at once he's coming in I'm dynamiting the brakes I'm trying to move this guy moves over he lays on his horn this guy just keeps on coming and somehow I don't even know how I just thought there's no way we're going to contact for sure and I didn't contact on either side I'm just guessing there was angels on both sides of the car going no hold that's good okay and somehow we we threaded the needle and I just I'm a great driver but it's it's beyond my skill to do that brother Matt you got another testimony all right was that a white Mercedes by any chance um I can't remember it all happened so fast so Saturday yeah on the way to church the exact same thing happened same spot wow same place same Lane same circumstances and I don't know how we didn't get hit I feel you so that's a the Lord is watching out for both of us amen praise the Lord amen praise
