[21:15] announcement is the beginning stages has
[21:17] started and we had a little concrete
[21:20] left to pour it's looking really good
[21:23] kind of reminds me of when I first
[21:24] started out as a Christian didn't look
[21:26] like a whole lot and I certainly hope I
[21:29] look a little more than that today but
[21:31] anyhow we all do we all want to grow in
[21:33] God don't we we have a vision of what
[21:36] this will look like when it's done and
[21:38] it's it's it's pretty beautiful is all I
[21:40] can say and I'm really looking forward
[21:42] to it it'll be all set up Sunday full
[21:45] bore
[21:46] 100% um with a few safety things to
[21:51] keep people from getting hurt um but
[21:55] praise God we got it started
[21:57] and he finishes his amen if you have a
[22:01] request upon your heart I just like to
[22:03] remember Jack's wife Kathy today sister
[22:05] Kathy still wasn't feeling good and um I
[22:09] do have a testimony of Bruce Noak his
[22:13] wife went through that surgery and um
[22:16] she's finally home um she had a period
[22:19] of probably a week and a half weakness
[22:21] and nause because she as Bruce said it
[22:24] seems like she started to turn a corner
[22:25] she's starting to get her strength
[22:27] backed and stuff that's just a tough
[22:29] thing to go through you know when you
[22:31] have a loved one and they're just going
[22:34] under these kind of Medical Treatments
[22:35] and stuff so we just want to hold them

[35:59] to the pulpit and and you don't have to
[36:01] labor through Thee the Lord is standing
[36:03] right
[36:05] here we appreciate that and I don't know
[36:07] if you got that PowerPoint up brother
[36:09] Brad but we're going to go directly to
[36:11] the
[36:12] word so thankful to have all the Watkins
[36:15] back you all had a wonderful time
[36:18] together as a family we missed you and
[36:21] glad you hurried back so continuing uh
[36:24] brother Jason asked me to continue on
[36:26] the topic that I was covering on Sunday
[36:29] overcoming depression we'll uh read the
[36:32] verse and then our musicians can find
[36:34] their
[36:38] seats Proverbs
[36:41] 12:25 anxiety in the heart of man causes
[36:45] depression but a good word makes it glad
[36:49] amen may the Lord add his Blessing to
[36:53] the reading of his word you can find
[36:54] your seats
[36:57] amen we
[37:01] are we're living in an hour and in an
[37:04] age as we talked about on Sunday where
[37:08] this modern Viewpoint of
[37:12] psychology is all
[37:15] pervasive it's everywhere it's it's in
[37:18] entertainment it's it's on the news it's
[37:20] in social media it's on it's taught on
[37:23] Tik Tik Tok uh schools are dedicating
[37:27] new
[37:28] um new positions in every school for a
[37:32] psychologist and it used to be when I
[37:34] was a a kid your school counselor just
[37:36] said what do you want to
[37:38] do okay I want to play sports this is
[37:41] what you need to do all right so now but
[37:44] now it's not that you are licensed
[37:46] psychologist and licensed counselors and
[37:49] social workers who are also trained in
[37:52] Psychology this picture is all pervasive
[37:56] from the time kids are in
[37:58] kindergarten and a and even to the point
[38:02] where their basis and their desire is to
[38:05] undermine the family and as you begin to
[38:09] study and look at this uh psychology
[38:12] it's a uh it's an
[38:15] ultra piece of feminism directly
[38:19] connected to the
[38:21] feministic spirit that's per permeating
[38:25] this age and so I want to speak about I
[38:28] want to combat that spirit because it is
[38:31] all pervasive to the point where many
[38:33] times we don't even recognize what's
[38:35] going on or what's what's happening um
[38:39] many many popular modern preachers oh
[38:43] they say we love his preaching it's just
[38:44] so relevant they're nothing more than a
[38:48] psychologist who is anointing their
[38:51] psychology with Biblical verses and
[38:54] ideas and terminology
[38:58] and so it's it's everywhere it's in the
[39:00] music industry po popular music it's in
[39:03] public schools it's new news media it's
[39:05] in the modern Pulpit it's almost to the
[39:08] point where it we don't even recognize
[39:11] it it's so all consuming and
[39:16] so as we read in the
[39:19] Bible it the Bible gives us an outline
[39:23] anxiety causes
[39:24] depression but a good word Mak makes it
[39:27] glad that's simple that's simple the
[39:30] Bible gives an outline for mental
[39:32] emotional spiritual and even physical
[39:35] healing to come to us the power of the
[39:39] Gospel is sent to us to bring healing
[39:43] and to transform us to have the mind of
[39:46] Christ amen in fact the New Covenant is
[39:50] that he gives us a new nature we were
[39:52] dead in sin and trespasses and now he's
[39:55] quickened us we're Made Alive
[39:57] together with
[39:59] Christ it's not a mere well just have a
[40:02] change of mind if we want to look at and
[40:05] think about psychology is they're simply
[40:08] trying to change your mind in order to
[40:11] bring healing we understand even even uh
[40:14] brother Don's sermon last week was a
[40:15] good precursor to that is they the devil
[40:20] will put a clog in those five channels
[40:25] of your mind and and and that clog will
[40:30] result in
[40:33] unbelief but the
[40:35] gospel uh comes to bring
[40:38] transformation it gives us a Ministry of
[40:41] the Holy
[40:42] Ghost every every one of us as Believers
[40:44] has a Ministry in the Holy Ghost you're
[40:47] given the Holy Ghost to profit with all
[40:51] or for the common good so each one has a
[40:54] gifting to bring a blessing to others so
[40:57] the Holy Ghost turns the focus from me
[41:02] to him and others I'm living to be a
[41:06] blessing to
[41:09] others it's teaching us to live
[41:12] unselfishly with true agape love and to
[41:16] help others be blessed to be healed and
[41:18] to feel the love of Christ as it comes
[41:22] forth from
[41:23] us it's also gives us an ongoing remedy
[41:27] as we talked about last service to
[41:29] combat anxiety that leads to
[41:33] depression it g it also gives us a
[41:36] community of people who are interested
[41:38] in loving and healing others in
[41:41] Christ it gives us elders and ministers
[41:45] that can counsel us by the word of God
[41:49] biblical counseling is not psychology
[41:52] amen if you can understand it correctly
[41:55] we're preaching the word of God to you
[41:57] here as a group counseling is simply
[42:00] applying the word of God in a very
[42:03] specific way here we're applying the
[42:05] word of God by preaching in counseling
[42:07] we simply apply the word of God to the
[42:10] life situation where there's a struggle
[42:13] and and uh counseling biblical
[42:15] counseling through a pastor through
[42:18] through the ministry is an important
[42:20] part of the local church but it is its
[42:23] approach functionally is not psychology
[42:27] its approach is bringing someone under
[42:31] submission to the will of God or let's
[42:33] put it this way perhaps the person is
[42:35] struggling to understand why the word is
[42:39] not having an effect in their life and
[42:41] it is due to a particular circumstance
[42:45] in their life of
[42:47] Disobedience and so the counseling is to
[42:50] point to the word so that repentance
[42:53] takes place or to a change of mind takes
[42:55] place so that health and healing and
[42:57] wholeness can be there in the human
[43:03] being and as we spoke about
[43:05] before I just I just want to go briefly
[43:08] into this because we laid the foundation
[43:09] on
[43:10] Sunday psycholog modern psychology and
[43:14] the modern
[43:15] philosophy about life is that everything
[43:18] is about being happy
[43:20] wow and so they seek after happiness as
[43:23] an end in itself this is what everyone's
[43:26] taught this this is what everyone goes
[43:28] for this is what psychologists are
[43:30] pointing to not only is what
[43:32] psychologists are pointing to it's it is
[43:34] what schools are pointing to and it's
[43:36] what parenting is pointing to and when
[43:38] you're pointing to that you're missing
[43:40] the mark entirely because God didn't
[43:43] design us to seek happiness for the sake
[43:45] of Happiness what what is what does
[43:48] Solomon tell us Solomon has access to
[43:51] all the pleasures of life he goes after
[43:53] everything he goes after study to be the
[43:57] greatest doctor of every every kind of
[43:59] knowledge what does he find out vanity
[44:02] vexation of spirit seeking that as an
[44:04] end in itself to find meaning you'll
[44:08] die
[44:10] seeking physical Pleasures as an ending
[44:13] of itself is Vanity of vanities it's
[44:16] meaningless and we we go on we go on and
[44:19] on what does he come to in the end and
[44:20] what he realizes and that's why I see
[44:22] that Solomon he repented at the end of
[44:24] his life in his old age amen
[44:27] but what did he what did he come to what
[44:29] is what is the the the purpose of man
[44:33] it's to fear God and to keep his
[44:36] Commandments this is the whole man in
[44:39] our translations it says the whole duty
[44:41] of man but we talked about it means the
[44:43] whole man this is the whole man this is
[44:48] what Man was created and designed for
[44:50] this is his purpose he'll never be happy
[44:53] he'll never find Joy he'll never find
[44:55] real meaning until he finds what makes
[44:59] him whole and that's fearing God and
[45:01] keeping his
[45:03] Commandments and we further know based
[45:05] on the New Covenant that he made with us
[45:07] that it's only by the baptism of the
[45:09] Holy Ghost that we can truly fear God
[45:11] and keep his Commandments because that
[45:13] is where he writes the word in our heart
[45:16] and in our mind so that we can live that
[45:18] word so it's that's the only satisfying
[45:21] portion that man can find regardless of
[45:24] his circumstances regardless of the
[45:26] scenario regardless of what it is that
[45:29] is what our purpose in life is for if
[45:32] you want to be a whole man or woman you
[45:37] must fear God and keep his
[45:41] Commandments and you have to know how
[45:43] that comes you you you can't approach it
[45:47] by your own works we understand how that
[45:49] comes based on the New Testament and the
[45:52] teaching of this
[45:55] message but in psychology is the
[45:57] scientific study of the mind and
[46:00] behavior psychologists are actively
[46:02] involved in studying and understanding
[46:05] mental processes brain functions and
[46:08] behavior the foundation of our world's
[46:12] Psychology today is a mixture of
[46:14] atheistic evolutionary feminist and
[46:17] Marxist thought that at its core Rejects
[46:21] and despises a Biblical worldview and
[46:24] the power of God unto salvation
[46:28] at its very core it's a
[46:30] misdiagnosis and the wrong prognosis and
[46:32] leaves people in the position of having
[46:35] no hope outside of themselves amen
[46:40] unless psychology understanding the mind
[46:43] and behavior is directed by the Bible
[46:46] and has at its core biblical Redemption
[46:48] by the power of God it is by its nature
[46:52] antagonistic towards healing and
[46:55] deliverance true healing in Deliverance
[46:58] as a minister of the Gospel I have to
[47:01] remember how the mind of man works but
[47:03] to divorce that from the Bible or to try
[47:06] to amalgamate modern psychology with
[47:09] Biblical thought is a horrible error
[47:11] amen and at its core it stagnates and
[47:14] removes people from the power of the
[47:17] Gospel of Jesus
[47:19] Christ let's look at Romans 12 verse 1 I
[47:24] beseech you therefore Brethren by the
[47:25] mercies of God that you present your
[47:27] bodies a Living Sacrifice wholly
[47:30] acceptable unto God which is your
[47:33] reasonable service and be not conformed
[47:37] to this world but be transformed by the
[47:40] renewing of your mind that you may prove
[47:43] what is that good and acceptable and
[47:46] perfect will of
[47:49] God Amen
[47:52] so psychology wants to conform us to a
[47:56] way of look looking at the world looking
[47:58] at life looking at the situations that
[48:01] we faced in in life but the gospel has
[48:05] come to
[48:07] transform us that word is literally
[48:10] transfigure that's the same word that's
[48:12] used for Jesus on Mount of
[48:16] transfiguration we are to be
[48:18] transfigured transformed by the renewing
[48:22] of our mind in other words what is the
[48:24] what is the aim and what is the goal
[48:26] amen it's the image of Jesus Christ we
[48:28] are to be a perfect reflection of Jesus
[48:32] Christ that's why we receive the Holy
[48:34] Ghost we receive the Holy Ghost because
[48:36] the Holy Ghost has a purpose that's to
[48:38] make us like Jesus
[48:40] Christ and so how are you going to get
[48:42] there it's by the renewing of your mind
[48:46] amen renewing of your mind towards what
[48:49] the mind of Christ what is that the word
[48:53] so how do we how do we have a renewing
[48:56] of the Mind
[48:57] it's by the revelation of the word
[48:59] through the Holy Spirit to us as
[49:02] individuals then through that we can
[49:04] prove what is that good and acceptable
[49:07] and perfect will of God but what does it
[49:10] start with asserting our self will
[49:13] asserting what we want in our life
[49:16] finding what makes us
[49:19] happy verse before that tells us exactly
[49:21] what it is present your body as a Living
[49:25] Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which
[49:28] is a reasonable service you it's a it's
[49:31] a total surrender to the purpose plan
[49:35] and will of God it's laying aside any
[49:38] goal that I have it's laying aside any
[49:41] plan that I have it's a lady assy any
[49:44] purpose I have and saying God I just
[49:46] want your will I want to be led by you I
[49:50] don't care what this world has to offer
[49:53] I only want
[49:55] you and and so that's how it starts it
[49:58] doesn't start by saying you know I
[50:00] really want to find a way to become very
[50:02] happy brother
[50:05] Luther no the the the place is the
[50:08] transformation comes and starts with
[50:10] offering your body amen offering your
[50:13] entire being to him on the Altar and
[50:17] saying I you can't take it back when you
[50:21] bring your lamb to the
[50:23] temple you don't bring it there and say
[50:25] well that was idea but you didn't do a
[50:28] sacrifice you didn't offer a sacrifice
[50:31] you changed your mind when you offer the
[50:34] sacrifice you give it to the priest wow
[50:36] amen and he takes care of the rest and
[50:40] so that's what we have to do we offer it
[50:42] to the Lord Jesus and we don't take it
[50:43] back we don't try to bring pick it up
[50:45] again we give it to
[50:48] him many of our problems this is that we
[50:50] Face many of our mental problems that we
[50:53] face and struggles and trials it's
[50:55] because we we want to pick it up yeah we
[50:59] want to pick it up we don't want to lay
[51:00] it down and leave it there
[51:08] amen 2 Corinthians 10 verse
[51:13] 3-5 for though we walk in the flesh we
[51:16] do not war after the flesh amen so again
[51:22] if we
[51:23] approach the battles that we face in our
[51:26] mind
[51:27] on the fleshly
[51:29] level we're not even we don't we don't
[51:32] even know where the war is yeah amen if
[51:34] we're just approaching it as well I want
[51:37] to reform
[51:39] myself you can many people
[51:43] do they they they they go to AA they
[51:47] they go to a
[51:48] psychologist and they learn how to
[51:51] reform themselves but that isn't what
[51:53] we're talking about here amen that isn't
[51:57] what the gospel is I have no problem
[52:00] with someone reforming themselves trying
[52:03] to make themselves a better life but
[52:05] you're Mi as a Christian you're missing
[52:07] the mark and you're you're in danger of
[52:10] making someone else your lord and
[52:12] savior I uh you
[52:15] know it it's we we look to the Lord the
[52:19] Lord is our
[52:22] strength and we look to what he has
[52:24] provided and so we can't we can't look
[52:26] at this battle that we're facing of life
[52:29] as merely a fleshly battle that we can
[52:31] win on a fleshly level or a mental level
[52:36] because we're not Waring after the
[52:39] flesh for the weapons of our Warfare are
[52:41] not carnal they're not
[52:43] fleshly but they're Mighty through God
[52:47] to the pulling down of
[52:50] strongholds casting down
[52:53] imaginations and every High thing that
[52:55] exalts itself
[52:57] against the knowledge of God and
[52:58] bringing into
[53:01] captivity most of our thoughts to The
[53:03] Obedience of
[53:06] Christ every thought to The Obedience of
[53:09] Christ and
[53:11] so if if it's a thought of anxiety if
[53:15] it's if it's a thought of fear if it's a
[53:18] spirit of depression trying to come upon
[53:20] you we have to bring every thought into
[53:24] that captivity amen
[53:27] we have to take it captive right that's
[53:30] that's a now we have political Wars and
[53:34] it's all everything's all messed up but
[53:35] in the past you did two things you
[53:37] either killed your enemy completely or
[53:40] you killed him and took him into
[53:42] captivity that's all you did so here
[53:45] here the purpose is every thought now
[53:47] must be captive to The Obedience of
[53:50] Christ so that in other words we're
[53:53] thinking the mind of Christ we're
[53:55] thinking his thoughts we're thinking
[53:57] word thoughts every situation every
[54:00] circumstance that we approach we're not
[54:02] thinking humanly speaking and
[54:04] approaching the situation humanly we're
[54:07] thinking about it with the mind of
[54:09] Christ and with the attitude and heart
[54:11] of Christ and every
[54:14] thought and there's a lot of thoughts
[54:18] that exalt themselves against the
[54:20] knowledge of God what we talked about
[54:23] before what is
[54:24] that how does the the devil talk to you
[54:28] he doesn't send a text
[54:30] message sometimes he does but not
[54:33] directly what does he do when he deals
[54:35] with you directly what is he doing he's
[54:38] getting to your mind amen and it comes
[54:41] as a thought in your
[54:43] mind and so then we have to every
[54:47] thought that comes we have to say is
[54:49] this of God or is this of the
[54:51] devil is the devil speaking or is God
[54:54] trying to deal with me
[54:57] right and so when we when those thoughts
[54:59] come we have to know which which one it
[55:01] is and cast down the ones that are from
[55:04] the enemy amen that's right
[55:14] Amen in the sermon the angel of
[55:18] God brother brandham
[55:21] says I will grant you this it is
[55:24] psychology in this way Psy I of course
[55:27] means mind and it's the mind of Christ
[55:29] and the human being has the privilege to
[55:31] enter in and know the mind of Christ
[55:34] Hallelujah my what a reality to dwell in
[55:36] the channel of Christ we unworthy
[55:39] Mortals have been brought in to be Sons
[55:42] and Daughters of God to be fellow
[55:46] citizens amen amen amen so the the the
[55:50] real
[55:52] psyche is having the mind of Christ and
[55:56] and that only comes by a supernatural
[55:57] birth we know that you cannot figure out
[56:00] the mind of Christ
[56:02] amen it's not an
[56:05] algorithm it's a supernatural experience
[56:08] that you walk in day by day by
[56:11] day amen and that's the important part
[56:15] to remember is psychology is offering
[56:17] you a natural means to try to heal what
[56:21] is its background worldview and what is
[56:26] it aiming at amen what is the word
[56:29] aiming at the word the word is aiming at
[56:32] your total
[56:34] health wow physical spiritual and at the
[56:38] soul level but it doesn't come he's not
[56:42] coming from the
[56:44] outside in that's what psychology is
[56:47] doing outside in approach but the word
[56:51] comes from the
[56:53] inside out amen it's it's coming by the
[56:57] baptism of the Holy Ghost to transform
[57:00] your nature in your soul so that nature
[57:03] is
[57:04] God so that you are being molded and
[57:07] shaped into the mind of
[57:15] Christ in Maya the prophet brother bam
[57:18] says we'll never be able to convert the
[57:20] World by trying to shine up our churches
[57:22] and make them bigger and polish up our
[57:24] ministers with better education
[57:26] they already got all that stuff they got
[57:29] all kinds of psychology and ball games
[57:31] and everything the world has got that
[57:32] but we got something they haven't got
[57:34] that's
[57:35] Christ amen try just stay in your own
[57:39] territory we got Christ they don't have
[57:41] Christ they got all the psychology don't
[57:43] try to match W them with wits you can't
[57:45] do it they don't they they can outmatch
[57:52] you just once more Lord now we got
[57:54] seminaries that hatch out our min
[57:56] ministers and we're building bigger ones
[57:58] all the time and we got students of
[57:59] psychology and that's all right if you
[58:01] want to teach psychology but I don't
[58:03] care about psychology I just want to
[58:05] know Jesus Christ that's all I want to
[58:07] know is
[58:08] him
[58:12] amen now psychology tries to explain and
[58:18] categorize human
[58:21] behavior as such it's directly affected
[58:24] by the worldview that stands behind that
[58:27] theory we have to understand that is
[58:31] people are trying to heal your mind
[58:33] they're trying to offer all kinds of
[58:34] things to heal your mind and we say we
[58:37] say well away with
[58:40] psychology in one in one sense people
[58:43] are handling it and saying we don't need
[58:45] counseling we just need uh preaching we
[58:48] don't need uh you know to talk we just
[58:51] need the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[58:53] that solves everything well
[58:57] you you have to have the word in the
[59:00] right balance amen amen the baptism of
[59:04] the Holy Ghost is just your starting
[59:08] process as a Christian you you you have
[59:12] the mind of Christ at an infant
[59:14] level right you have to grow into
[59:18] it he gives us the word he gives us life
[59:21] experiences that causes us to grow into
[59:24] it sometimes we get to a place brother
[59:26] Bram was a holy ghost filled Christian
[59:29] got to the place where he wanted to take
[59:30] his own life yeah amen
[59:34] okay you can get to a place where you
[59:36] have
[59:38] complexes and it's by the preaching of
[59:40] the word but also by personal
[59:42] application of the word look we have we
[59:45] have we're friends with one another we
[59:46] have friends and we can talk to each
[59:48] other we have a
[59:50] pastor we as the body of Christ need to
[59:54] be tools in the hands of the Lord to
[59:56] help heal one another all of us will
[59:59] find oursel in a situation where we have
[1:00:02] where our mind is all gummed
[1:00:04] up
[1:00:06] amen and we're
[1:00:08] struggling and I think the I think the
[1:00:11] point I'm trying to make is be in be in
[1:00:14] balanced about it if we preach the
[1:00:17] baptism of the Holy Ghost in such a way
[1:00:19] to make you think that you'll never have
[1:00:20] a problem again in your life we've
[1:00:23] really missed the mark amen but if we if
[1:00:26] we preach on uh dealing with your mind
[1:00:30] and H how to go through problems without
[1:00:32] getting you to the baptism of the Holy
[1:00:34] Ghost we're just trying to treat the
[1:00:36] outside symptom again we're coming from
[1:00:39] the outside in we got to go from the
[1:00:40] inside out amen but but really realize
[1:00:44] that there's times and I could speak of
[1:00:46] my own experiences that you're all
[1:00:49] messed up and you're thinking about
[1:00:50] people and situations and you go talk to
[1:00:54] a brother and he says what yeah you're
[1:00:57] think
[1:00:58] what the scripture says this and this
[1:01:01] and you go I'm such a dummy I was
[1:01:04] thinking I was just thinking I was stuck
[1:01:06] in my thoughts all that time about that
[1:01:08] and I wasn't even looking at it right
[1:01:10] see and we can that's healing yes amen
[1:01:14] that's that's that's amen that's friend
[1:01:17] biblical
[1:01:18] friendship you know better are the
[1:01:20] wounds of the I don't forget how the
[1:01:22] scripture goes but better are the wounds
[1:01:23] of a friend yeah and the the kisses of
[1:01:27] an enemy something like that you know
[1:01:29] people will people will flatter you from
[1:01:32] a distance but yet your friend is the
[1:01:34] one that knows you and could say w
[1:01:36] what's going on here I'm not sure that
[1:01:39] you're looking at this situation the
[1:01:41] right way and that's we need each other
[1:01:43] for that we all get to that place and
[1:01:46] and and the thing is that you know the
[1:01:48] world wants to replace that with a a
[1:01:51] psychologist and a social worker and and
[1:01:53] maybe that's okay maybe somebody has to
[1:01:55] do that
[1:01:56] but the reality is
[1:01:58] that they can't do what if I just would
[1:02:02] talk to my wife about the situation what
[1:02:04] my wife could do or what my friend could
[1:02:06] do they can't there's a relationship
[1:02:09] there there's a friendship there maybe
[1:02:10] there's a little joke that can go
[1:02:11] forward and lightens things up that
[1:02:14] would bring
[1:02:16] healing you see there there's so many
[1:02:18] things that we miss but the devil wants
[1:02:22] when there's a spirit of depression the
[1:02:23] devil will bring you to the place where
[1:02:25] you just isolate yourself from everybody
[1:02:28] amen that's right or or you get these
[1:02:32] thoughts of anxiety and we you pet them
[1:02:34] and baby them and pet yourself and baby
[1:02:37] yourself and encourage yourself I'm just
[1:02:38] you know I'm just an anxious
[1:02:40] person
[1:02:42] again uh all these mental illnesses that
[1:02:45] they've codified
[1:02:48] today is I doubt that they're even
[1:02:52] real because the reality is many of them
[1:02:55] are just identifying a devil and then
[1:02:59] people are accepting a
[1:03:02] devil anointing upon their mind amen and
[1:03:06] I just I personally like to say I'm an
[1:03:09] overcomer God I'm not an anxious person
[1:03:12] I'm an
[1:03:13] overcomer I've got Wars and battles but
[1:03:16] I'm day by day defeating the
[1:03:19] enemy every day that I wake up and keep
[1:03:22] walking with God I'm defeating the enemy
[1:03:24] once again amen and so this extreme the
[1:03:29] the the the
[1:03:30] world's Theory and approach to this is
[1:03:35] painted by the world's system and it's
[1:03:39] an antichrist and anti-
[1:03:41] mentality and we as as Believers need to
[1:03:45] un understand the big
[1:03:48] picture not only with what the world's
[1:03:51] pushing on us with psychology but also
[1:03:54] how we can be tool in the hands of the
[1:03:56] Lord to heal one
[1:04:01] another it can also it can be it can be
[1:04:05] uh even dangerous to to sometimes you're
[1:04:10] preaching so hard against psychology and
[1:04:13] people start to think I can't talk to
[1:04:15] anybody I'm struggling in my mind I
[1:04:16] can't talk to anybody that's not what is
[1:04:19] being said over the pulpit right
[1:04:22] now I I what I'm what I'm saying the
[1:04:25] opposite is we God has given us the
[1:04:28] tools there's people right here if
[1:04:31] somebody's struggling that will help you
[1:04:32] get healed and get free they'll just
[1:04:35] listen to you and point you to the
[1:04:37] scripture amen don't just sit there and
[1:04:40] struggle and fight and fume and fuss
[1:04:43] when you have a pastor that'd be more
[1:04:45] than willing to talk to you and other
[1:04:46] ministers that would and brothers and
[1:04:49] sisters that would just sit and listen
[1:04:51] to you say I need to talk
[1:04:56] we have to realize that we we all
[1:04:57] struggle and we all face difficulties
[1:05:00] and that we're all here for each other
[1:05:05] amen I
[1:05:07] think I just want I want to get this out
[1:05:10] and then move on to my next St I think
[1:05:13] what we have right now in this
[1:05:16] prevailing Theory especially amongst the
[1:05:18] Young Generation is that well this
[1:05:22] Behavior comes as a result of a trauma
[1:05:25] response from
[1:05:27] childhood and people talk and say well
[1:05:30] I'm triggered by certain things that I
[1:05:32] encounter this then then this creates a
[1:05:34] behavior chain resulting from past
[1:05:37] experiences is there a truth to that
[1:05:41] sure sure it is but don't that you you
[1:05:44] go looking under every Rock for that
[1:05:46] you're going to find
[1:05:47] it amen as we talked about before that
[1:05:51] understanding and approach to psychology
[1:05:53] lead leads to a permanent victim
[1:05:56] mentality it helps
[1:05:58] nothing it improves nothing and it makes
[1:06:00] a bunch of soft people that are not able
[1:06:03] to function in life in a normal way
[1:06:06] they're not able to go to a job they
[1:06:08] need mental health breaks because
[1:06:11] someone told them they did something
[1:06:13] wrong at the job they can't stand
[1:06:15] correction they're bastard children even
[1:06:17] though they grew up with a mom and dad
[1:06:18] in their home cuz their mom and dad
[1:06:20] don't want to correct them because what
[1:06:23] what's going to happen oh if we if we're
[1:06:25] hard on them they'll have a mental
[1:06:26] trauma and they'll get older and and
[1:06:28] they'll blame it on us that you know
[1:06:30] what if they're a real if you raise them
[1:06:32] right they'll stay in the way that they
[1:06:34] go and they'll praise God for a mom and
[1:06:36] a dad that spanked
[1:06:38] them
[1:06:41] am the Bible and we'll look at the
[1:06:44] scriptures but the Bible never allows us
[1:06:46] to blame our behavior and our responses
[1:06:48] on other people we are responsible in
[1:06:52] his sight for our choice choices and for
[1:06:54] our own behavior
[1:06:56] and definitely trauma response can be
[1:06:58] helpful in understanding some root
[1:07:00] causes brother brandham talks about it
[1:07:02] in some of his discernment lines even
[1:07:05] some behaviors some behaviors but we
[1:07:08] can't explain everything and explain it
[1:07:10] away and give ourselves an excuse of why
[1:07:14] we can't be
[1:07:16] healed you think about it these young
[1:07:19] people have been raised more gently than
[1:07:21] any generation in history and they have
[1:07:24] the most hatred for their parents and
[1:07:27] they don't want to have children of
[1:07:28] their
[1:07:29] own it's because of the root problem of
[1:07:32] this
[1:07:33] feministic ly
[1:07:36] livered psychological trauma
[1:07:41] response approach to raising children
[1:07:44] and that we've given to our own
[1:07:47] selves and again I said before I'm sure
[1:07:49] there are social workers that have
[1:07:51] helped people help people change their
[1:07:53] minds that's good I never want to take
[1:07:55] away any kind of help that a person
[1:07:58] could have but if it's pointing people
[1:08:01] away from Christ and pointing them
[1:08:04] towards some
[1:08:06] pathetic
[1:08:08] weak uh thing that keeps them as a
[1:08:12] victim ultimately what is it Satan has
[1:08:15] created this atmosphere of psychology
[1:08:17] upon the people's minds to keep them him
[1:08:21] standing under he's standing on top of
[1:08:23] them that's what he's doing he's got his
[1:08:25] foot over their head and that's all that
[1:08:29] they know to do I'm a victim I'm a I'm a
[1:08:33] victim you we have to realize the system
[1:08:36] of training and approaching life around
[1:08:40] this world has caused almost irreparable
[1:08:44] damage to the point that the nation must
[1:08:48] perish amen and it has produced a
[1:08:51] generation of people that is the most
[1:08:54] depressed people people in the history
[1:08:57] of this
[1:09:00] nation brother Bram said it was a
[1:09:02] neurotic age and brother branham's time
[1:09:04] people struggled with anxiety not even
[1:09:06] depression as we talked about before the
[1:09:09] statistics show almost no one was
[1:09:11] depressed in America in the 50s and 60s
[1:09:14] but they were anxious now everyone is
[1:09:18] anxious and 15 to 25% of people are have
[1:09:22] major depressive disorder so could it be
[1:09:26] that the system that's training people's
[1:09:29] minds is wrong yes of course that's what
[1:09:32] it is it's not according to the Bible
[1:09:35] and it corresponds directly with when
[1:09:38] they kicked the Bible out of the school
[1:09:40] and put the psychologist in the Bible's
[1:09:46] place and it's crippled them to the
[1:09:48] point where all they think about is
[1:09:50] their own
[1:09:52] happiness they're they're taught and
[1:09:55] encourage encouraged by their school and
[1:09:57] by their parents seek you got to you got
[1:10:00] to be happy come on and everything's
[1:10:03] telling them find find happiness that's
[1:10:06] the real meaning of life is being
[1:10:09] happy and then what do they give them as
[1:10:12] the means to be happy well this person
[1:10:15] hurt my
[1:10:16] feelings and now I can't do that anymore
[1:10:19] because I'm traumatized by it so not
[1:10:22] only does the devil see have them
[1:10:25] seeking after something that is actually
[1:10:28] like a vapor that you can't even grab
[1:10:29] hold of even as Christians we can't live
[1:10:32] like that saying I'm seeking after
[1:10:34] what's making happy uh seeking after
[1:10:37] something that's that that's happy
[1:10:39] happiness is like a vapor you can't grab
[1:10:42] a hold of it how many times are you
[1:10:44] happy during a day I don't
[1:10:47] know the more you think about it the
[1:10:49] less happy you'll be I promise
[1:10:52] you instead they encourage people to
[1:10:55] ruminate over the people that have hurt
[1:10:57] them person that's done me wrong this
[1:11:00] one this one hurt my feelings my my mom
[1:11:03] spanked me now I I won't be able to
[1:11:05] function as a as a good adult because
[1:11:08] I'm traumatized by this correction that
[1:11:10] I received by this crazy
[1:11:13] monster that's what they think and when
[1:11:16] I was young my my mom said this and I
[1:11:18] was a teenager my dad did this and uh
[1:11:23] I'm unhappy and my life is ruined
[1:11:24] because of it
[1:11:26] look everyone goes through struggles and
[1:11:29] trials yes amen you will be miserable if
[1:11:32] you're trying to avoid struggles and
[1:11:34] trials you young men you have to be
[1:11:37] challenged you have to do hard and
[1:11:40] difficult things all of us and if you
[1:11:42] don't you will be unhappy amen that's
[1:11:45] that's part of the problem in America we
[1:11:47] have everything so easy we're unhappy
[1:11:50] all the time but again it's seeking
[1:11:54] after the wind and reaping the Whirlwind
[1:11:56] is what this nation has done and they're
[1:11:59] ending up in the beginning of
[1:12:02] Ecclesiastes vanity of vanities all is
[1:12:05] Vanity and they want to take their own
[1:12:07] life thinking about our problems does
[1:12:09] not solve them amen true thinking about
[1:12:12] the thoughts that we have and ruminating
[1:12:14] about our past and the troubles and
[1:12:16] trials that we had doesn't bring healing
[1:12:19] amen it makes you
[1:12:21] worse it it doesn't improve the
[1:12:24] situation it makes it worse
[1:12:26] not only that the Bible tells us not to
[1:12:28] do that am the Bible tells us to to
[1:12:31] think on good things think on positive
[1:12:35] things think on the testimonies that God
[1:12:38] has given you think about the good
[1:12:39] things that God has provided you think
[1:12:42] about the word what the word
[1:12:47] says there are times of course we talked
[1:12:50] about it sometimes you need to talk
[1:12:51] about what you're going through
[1:12:52] sometimes you don't you just need to
[1:12:53] move on
[1:12:55] amen
[1:12:57] amen sometimes talking too much about it
[1:12:59] makes you fixated on it sometimes it's
[1:13:02] just just move
[1:13:04] on Commit it to God it happened it hurt
[1:13:09] let's move on with
[1:13:12] God we love him he's a Healer and the
[1:13:15] thing is what you're so we become so
[1:13:19] focused on self that we miss what
[1:13:22] actually God wants to use us for
[1:13:28] what we need today this is from the
[1:13:30] identified Masterpiece of God what we
[1:13:32] need today is the Life of Christ inside
[1:13:34] of us that's what purifies not the
[1:13:37] outward turned around collar or degree
[1:13:39] of psychology or something it takes the
[1:13:41] power of the resurrected Christ to make
[1:13:44] us what we should be God has no other
[1:13:47] plan than let the Holy Spirit Rule and
[1:13:49] reign in the church
[1:13:52] amen that is the plan
[1:13:55] that is the purpose of God if we want
[1:13:58] that's what he wants to do through us
[1:14:00] right he doesn't want us thinking about
[1:14:03] past hurts and past pains if you need if
[1:14:06] you're keep thinking about it go talk to
[1:14:08] someone that can help set you
[1:14:11] straight and move
[1:14:15] forward Satan has so
[1:14:18] deceived this
[1:14:20] world their total focus is inward
[1:14:27] amen the whole
[1:14:29] focus of the mind and the heart is
[1:14:33] selfish selfish and self-centered
[1:14:36] they're taught don't judge how you feel
[1:14:39] your feelings are the absolute they're
[1:14:42] your final Authority follow your
[1:14:45] feelings what a
[1:14:47] Madness what a
[1:14:50] danger you have to understand why you
[1:14:53] feel the way you feel you have to keep
[1:14:55] keep coming back to these same thoughts
[1:14:57] over and over again and and you know
[1:14:59] your therapists will treat you they'll
[1:15:01] give you they'll talk to you for a fee
[1:15:04] every
[1:15:05] week and they'll get you the medication
[1:15:07] that you need for all this of course I
[1:15:11] know people struggle I know people face
[1:15:13] difficulties I do I face sorrow I face
[1:15:16] sadness but it's a h it's a how we
[1:15:19] approach it that dictates whether we
[1:15:22] heal or whether we become
[1:15:27] victims Perpetual victims that's what
[1:15:30] our young people
[1:15:32] today that's gen gen Z gen Alpha they
[1:15:36] are they are being trained and taught to
[1:15:38] be Perpetual victims and fact they're
[1:15:42] they protest
[1:15:43] for the atrocity atrocities of Hamas not
[1:15:47] knowing what they're protesting for but
[1:15:49] they find meaning in this self-centered
[1:15:53] crazy
[1:15:55] mindless approach to I don't even know
[1:15:59] what they're doing
[1:16:03] Madness they they they would step one
[1:16:06] foot in Gaza Strip they
[1:16:10] would they're not talking about
[1:16:13] that they have no idea what they're
[1:16:15] talking about or what they're dealing
[1:16:16] with or what they're doing am they're
[1:16:19] just victims and anyone else that's a
[1:16:21] victim they identify with that
[1:16:26] victimhood
[1:16:30] wow how about we do what Jesus said to
[1:16:35] do and that we get our eyes off of
[1:16:38] oursel and get our eyes on him and
[1:16:42] serving
[1:16:43] others that's the that's the approach
[1:16:46] that we need to take he didn't many
[1:16:49] times Christians struggle because they
[1:16:52] think being a Christian is coming to
[1:16:55] church and sitting in a Pew you are
[1:16:57] supposed to be active you are supposed
[1:17:00] to be serving others you are supposed to
[1:17:01] be looking for people to help heal and
[1:17:05] if you just sit on your hands and listen
[1:17:07] to preaching that's all you ever do and
[1:17:10] and sing the songs and don't put your
[1:17:13] faith into action in serving others amen
[1:17:17] you will get stuck in the self centered
[1:17:23] cycle we have to get off of
[1:17:26] that Philippians 4:6 I'm going to read
[1:17:29] from the
[1:17:31] NLT don't worry about anything instead
[1:17:33] pray about everything tell God what you
[1:17:36] need and thank him for all he has done
[1:17:40] as we talked about before you're
[1:17:42] exercising the very same thing just
[1:17:45] which direction are you going towards
[1:17:47] Satan or
[1:17:50] God when we when we think about
[1:17:52] something a situation and we begin to
[1:17:54] worry and we think about all the
[1:17:56] possibilities of what can go wrong our
[1:17:59] our we're we're exercising faith in what
[1:18:02] Satan is speaking to
[1:18:04] us and we'll be conformed to that way of
[1:18:07] thinking good instead instead of
[1:18:11] worrying in because that's ex again
[1:18:13] that's exercising faith in the word of
[1:18:15] Satan instead pray about everything tell
[1:18:19] God what you need and thank him for all
[1:18:22] he has done not only for all that he's
[1:18:23] done but all that he's going to
[1:18:26] do because if he's made a promise you've
[1:18:28] identified that promise you've prayed
[1:18:30] about it he's under obligation to
[1:18:32] fulfill it for
[1:18:33] you then you will experience God's
[1:18:37] peace which exceeds anything we can
[1:18:40] understand did you see that then that's
[1:18:42] a connection that means this verse is
[1:18:45] connected to the that verse if you do
[1:18:47] this then this will follow if you do
[1:18:50] this don't worry about anything instead
[1:18:53] pray about everything tell God what you
[1:18:55] need thank him for all he's done
[1:18:57] then you will experience God's peace
[1:19:01] it's a perfect formula from the word we
[1:19:04] want peace Philippians 4:6 follow that
[1:19:08] and you'll receive the peace that
[1:19:10] exceeds anything we can understand his
[1:19:13] peace will guard your hearts and Minds
[1:19:14] as you live in Christ Jesus and now dear
[1:19:17] brothers and sisters one final thing fix
[1:19:20] your thoughts on what is true and
[1:19:22] honorable and right and pure and lovely
[1:19:24] and admir able think about those things
[1:19:26] that are excellent and worthy of Praise
[1:19:29] so Paul is telling you what you must
[1:19:31] think about amen it's not just what you
[1:19:34] have to do he's telling this is how if
[1:19:37] you want peace then you have to think
[1:19:40] about these things if you think about
[1:19:43] worry fear
[1:19:45] anxiety it is going to produce
[1:19:48] unbelief it's not going to produce Faith
[1:19:51] so if you if you want peace follow what
[1:19:54] Paul is telling you to
[1:19:58] do he reiterates
[1:20:00] it even further keep putting into
[1:20:03] practice all you learned and received
[1:20:06] from me everything you heard from me and
[1:20:09] saw me doing then he used that word
[1:20:12] again then then the God of Peace will be
[1:20:16] with you
[1:20:17] this is amazing to me look at this verse
[1:20:21] Paul is telling them put into practice
[1:20:24] what I've taught you and the example
[1:20:26] that I've left to you then you'll have
[1:20:29] peace amen we think if I just pray hard
[1:20:33] enough I'll have peace well there's a
[1:20:36] connection to that but it's not just
[1:20:38] that it's what you think about if you
[1:20:41] pray and then worry worry worry worry
[1:20:43] worry worry worry you're not doing what
[1:20:45] the word is saying to do you pray you
[1:20:48] give thanks to God you commit it to him
[1:20:50] then you then you then you say Lord help
[1:20:53] me instead of going back to the worry
[1:20:56] help me to think about the things that's
[1:20:59] pleasing to you that you've told me to
[1:21:01] think about and then we have to go
[1:21:03] further and realize that if we're not
[1:21:05] walking in obedience to the Vindicated
[1:21:08] word of the hour then we can't expect to
[1:21:11] experience peace in our life if our life
[1:21:14] is budding up against what the word says
[1:21:17] and saying no no no no I I'll go this
[1:21:19] far but not that far we can't expect to
[1:21:22] experience peace in our life it it has
[1:21:25] to be a full surrender to the
[1:21:28] word to do to do what the Apostle taught
[1:21:32] us to do not not in part not with our
[1:21:37] own thinking but a fully surrendered
[1:21:39] life to
[1:21:41] him then the peace that passes that goes
[1:21:44] beyond all
[1:21:45] circumstances will
[1:21:48] follow once again I'm going to have
[1:21:51] another part to this
[1:21:56] let me skip ahead a little bit to where
[1:21:58] I
[1:21:59] can
[1:22:06] finish again as we started you can never
[1:22:09] do any of this without the power of God
[1:22:13] by the holy ghost in your life that's
[1:22:15] the prerequisite get the baptism of the
[1:22:18] Holy Ghost have a true and genuine
[1:22:21] experience with God so that you know
[1:22:24] that you know that you know that you
[1:22:25] have it without question I have received
[1:22:28] the Holy Ghost and I'm a new man I'm
[1:22:33] changed but then now we're set free now
[1:22:37] we're set free now we're not in bondage
[1:22:39] to sin
[1:22:42] anymore but it we have to
[1:22:45] let Faith have control amen we can let
[1:22:49] worry and fear and we can get all kinds
[1:22:51] of complexes built up in our mind
[1:22:54] or we can let go of it
[1:22:58] all and let God be in
[1:23:00] control no doubt every one of us has
[1:23:04] experienced things that have hurt us
[1:23:06] that have frustrated us that we could
[1:23:09] fixate on and say I'm leaving
[1:23:13] everything but there's something if you
[1:23:16] got the Holy Ghost your predestinated
[1:23:18] seat of God there's something on the
[1:23:20] inside of the inside that's pushing you
[1:23:23] forward despite
[1:23:25] despite your better judgment as brother
[1:23:27] brandham
[1:23:28] said you're you're going forward with
[1:23:31] God and you're saying I don't know what
[1:23:33] happened and I don't know why it
[1:23:35] happened but God allowed it to happen
[1:23:39] and I trust him and I love him and I'm
[1:23:41] walking forward so that faith can be
[1:23:45] that controlling thought pattern and
[1:23:48] your living and doing the word
[1:23:52] regardless all right so I want to just
[1:23:54] in clo in closing just a few more
[1:23:57] minutes talk about some of the steps of
[1:24:00] doing the
[1:24:02] word I think this is important because
[1:24:05] the Bible does clearly give us a process
[1:24:10] for holess and when we have when there's
[1:24:12] a a a struggle and a sickness in your
[1:24:15] mind and again in all that I've said I'm
[1:24:19] not detracting from the fact that there
[1:24:21] are struggles by any means Amen brother
[1:24:24] brand had them I have them you have them
[1:24:27] we all know that we're not so super
[1:24:29] spiritual with Halos on our heads that
[1:24:31] we don't realize that our our thoughts
[1:24:34] can get messed up and mixed up and we
[1:24:36] can struggle and get frustrated and
[1:24:40] really if if if we understand it's all
[1:24:43] on
[1:24:44] us and we have to understand that it is
[1:24:46] on us to control how we think about
[1:24:50] things am and what we let control us cuz
[1:24:52] those thoughts can control control you
[1:24:56] and stop you from doing what doing the
[1:24:58] word living the
[1:25:00] word so what are some steps of doing the
[1:25:02] word if you're
[1:25:04] struggling if you're having trials if
[1:25:06] you're facing difficulties if you're
[1:25:09] stuck up in your mind that you just
[1:25:11] can't let go of something talk to your
[1:25:14] pastor or someone that you trust in the
[1:25:16] body of Christ talking through the
[1:25:18] depression can often lead a person to
[1:25:21] discover wrong ways of thinking
[1:25:23] unrepented of sin or just help them be
[1:25:26] released from the pain that they have by
[1:25:28] talking to someone that cares I've seen
[1:25:31] it many times in counseling people just
[1:25:33] listening I didn't say a word almost the
[1:25:36] whole time and I just listened and I and
[1:25:39] I could feel what they were going
[1:25:41] through and at the end I I gave them
[1:25:43] just a little scripture and prayed with
[1:25:45] them oh my I'm just the Lord has healed
[1:25:49] me I I feel like I've just been totally
[1:25:52] released from this thing thank you so
[1:25:53] much for everything you did I didn't do
[1:25:56] anything the Lord did it amise the Lord
[1:26:01] and you just talk to someone that
[1:26:03] cared that's what we need to be as a
[1:26:07] part of the body of Christ people that
[1:26:09] care you any of us if you care you can
[1:26:13] be a means of healing for someone
[1:26:16] amen act in obedience to God's word no
[1:26:19] matter the
[1:26:22] circumstances act in obedience to the
[1:26:25] word the devil's going to try to push
[1:26:27] you away from doing
[1:26:29] that wake up in the morning spend time
[1:26:33] in prayer reading the Bible listening to
[1:26:35] the message before you go to
[1:26:38] sleep
[1:26:39] pray read the Bible do the same thing
[1:26:44] amen attend every church service and
[1:26:47] bible study and prayer meeting the
[1:26:48] Church
[1:26:50] offers talk to and fellowship with
[1:26:52] like-minded believers
[1:26:55] this is on the carnal level but it has
[1:26:57] its impact everywhere exercise your body
[1:27:01] drink water eat
[1:27:03] healthy right amen as brother John Andy
[1:27:07] says drink water
[1:27:09] brother that's
[1:27:11] true many times we become dehydrated and
[1:27:14] it impacts on all of our
[1:27:16] health these things are carnal but they
[1:27:19] do all of them it has an impact on the
[1:27:21] whole person
[1:27:24] resolve conflicts quickly as best as you
[1:27:27] can deal with people that wrong you
[1:27:30] directly not in Gossip or behind their
[1:27:33] backs playing the blame game go directly
[1:27:35] to your brother or sister and speak to
[1:27:37] them and get it resolved many times a
[1:27:40] person facing depression it's coming
[1:27:43] because they've not resolved the
[1:27:45] conflicts that they have and they've
[1:27:47] hold on to something instead of doing
[1:27:50] what the word says and it's maybe it's
[1:27:52] very uncomfortable to do but it's what
[1:27:54] the word says Matthew
[1:27:57] 18 doesn't say go and gossip go tell
[1:28:00] your therapist about how horrible this
[1:28:01] person
[1:28:02] is it says go and deal with them
[1:28:05] directly many times we Face mental
[1:28:09] struggles and trials because we're not
[1:28:11] doing the word if we just did what the
[1:28:14] word said to do it would we wouldn't
[1:28:17] even get sick in our
[1:28:20] minds all right start do musicians if
[1:28:23] you come
[1:28:25] we talked about this before but I think
[1:28:26] it's important start doing something to
[1:28:29] serve
[1:28:31] others we get so focused on oursel take
[1:28:34] the focus off of yourself and put it on
[1:28:38] others when
[1:28:40] God deals with you and heals you from
[1:28:43] something many times that's the very
[1:28:46] thing that God will use you to help
[1:28:48] others with
[1:28:49] amen and as we talked about control your
[1:28:54] thought Life by the power of the Holy
[1:28:56] Ghost speak to yourself with scriptural
[1:29:00] patterns of thought not with demonic
[1:29:03] lies and patterns from your past and the
[1:29:06] ways that the world teaches you to
[1:29:08] nurture your feelings think the with the
[1:29:11] mind of
[1:29:13] Christ again what is the devil's purpose
[1:29:16] when the devil has created this system
[1:29:19] of the world in this program he wants to
[1:29:21] have victory over the Saints
[1:29:24] yes he wants us defeated and he wants us
[1:29:27] living defeated so that we're it's a
[1:29:29] powerless
[1:29:31] bride we can't we we can't be in that
[1:29:34] situation in that circumstance and it's
[1:29:36] going to the greatest battle ever fought
[1:29:38] where is it fought between your
[1:29:42] ears between your ears but we have to
[1:29:45] remember it takes that soul in full
[1:29:48] surrender to the word as the control
[1:29:51] tower controlling over the mind the
[1:29:54] devil chose your mind chose the ma the
[1:29:56] mind of man as his Battlegrounds God
[1:29:59] chose the heart and that's heart that
[1:30:02] that is the place by the Holy Ghost
[1:30:05] where we can then be Overcomers and
[1:30:08] control amen how we think what we think
[1:30:11] about and what we're feeding on because
[1:30:13] ultimately it has to be word thoughts
[1:30:17] word on top of word lined in our soul so
[1:30:21] that we're expressing expressing the
[1:30:23] full manifestation of Jesus
[1:30:26] Christ amen let's pray Heavenly
