========================================

are the same yesterday today and forever your heart towards your people is the same and whatever Satan throws at us we know we know that we'll overcome every wave that comes will crest every bit of it Lord and will will come through Lord by your grace all the way to the very end Lord we don't know we don't know our path we don't even know necessarily the next step on our journey Lord but we know you and we know that you're faithful and we know that your promises are immutable unchangeable Lord and we cling to that with all of our heart Lord we pray your blessing on on those who are away at the men's meeting on brother Jason and the ministry team there at the men's meeting blessed them and bless each of the Saints the brothers that are here from here that are there Lord just may it be a great refreshing time for them and watch over them as they travel as well father we commit ourselves to you father we want to we want to step out of the way we want you to come we want you to take over we ask these things in Jesus precious name amen amen so our look at our first scripture and really we're going to be spending much of our time looking at this in Hebrews chapter 6. and brother Josh if you want to help me control it appreciate that and the small version came through I hope they are not all like that otherwise we might as well just take it down those of you in the front row if you want to come up here you can probably see it if you stand right next to the screen um amen Hebrews 6 verse 4 so I guess we're going to be old school you can if you have a Bible you could turn to that and if you're new school if you have a phone which you all do you can look at that for it is impossible for those who are once enlightened and have tasted of the Heavenly gift and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the world to come if they shall fall away to renew them again unto repentance seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh and put him to an open shame may the Lord add the blessing to the reading of his word you can be seated you say your your title is very strange married to the backslider and you read this scripture which can be sometimes looked at as a conundrum Hebrews chapter 6. and that's what I want to spend time on looking at this and looking at it in the context of the scripture and the message so when we're looking at this verse These verses it appears that's what it's saying is when if someone Falls away if they fall away the word following means to deviate from the right path they cannot be renewed in Repentance okay so that's taking the scripture just at face value without understanding anything beyond that you would look at that and say a person can have genuine faith genuine genuine experience with God and then fall away from this experience with God look at what it's saying if we go back there they were enlightened they were taste they tasted of the Heavenly gift they were made partakers of the Holy Ghost they tasted the word of God they tasted the powers of the world or the age to come so what is this telling us very strange it's almost you almost read it in it in a way it feels discouraging what hope do I have if if I would fall away I can't repent again I can't come back to Salvation because I'm I'm crucifying the Son of God a second time if I were to do that thank God these aren't the only verses in Hebrews chapter 6. or the whole Bible they are verses and they are true but until you look at the con the rest of the context you'll be confused and you see people that hold to that that are against eternal security perseverance of the Saints they always bring you this scripture oh I see what you're saying about predestination but this scripture proves all the rest of the Bible wrong oh okay interesting again it's it seems like this is saying two things a person has had an experience with God and they can fall away from the faith and a person that has fallen away cannot come back because it would be a second crucifixion of Christ but I want to show you scripturally these things are that's an impossibility so we can't take this verse and again this is a huge mistake that many people make whether it be a message believer or not a message believer is you take one verse or series of verses out of context and create a whole Doctrine surrounding this you knuckle down on two verses and then reinterpret the rest of the Bible or the rest of the message in order to arrive at the point that you're trying to make and that's that's a great error great mistake the subject matter could go on and on in the message you know a person could could take the few quotes where brother Branham says Jesus is is not God but then dismiss a thousand quotes that he says he was God and so you we never want to do that for anything we want to understand its context we want to understand how brother branham's understanding was developing over time the things that he taught when the sea when the seals were opened if the Lord showed him I've been I've been corrected on this thing again we take the whole context not our favorite context not the one that we like that arrives at our conclusion but we take the whole word of God that's critical if if if we take Hebrews 6 4-6 and make the point that I've made about it we would then have to dismiss an avalanche of scripture so again it's saying the person was enlightened they've tasted the Heavenly gift made partakers of the Holy Ghost tasted the word of God tasted the powers of the age to come seems like a very good experience doesn't it seem good to you does it doesn't it seem like something that you want absolutely person that has experienced justification in their lives they've been born of the spirit of God cannot fall away from the faith you can have ups and downs in your life you can backslide but you can never permanently fall away this would be dishonoring God in Christ and it would just demonstrate that God is Not omnipotent and it would show that the the Father and Son aren't in unity are in disagreement let's look at the next scripture John 10 verse 28 and 29 and and also verse 30. Jesus speaking and I give unto them eternal life all right so there there's our start he gives them he gives them eternal life we don't give ourselves eternal life we don't choose to have eternal life but he says I give my sheep eternal life and they shall never perish so if they've been given eternal life if they if they're in other words if they're enlightened they taste of the word they they're partakers of the Holy Ghost they fall away they could never renew themselves again to repentance must be speaking of something something different because here Jesus saying I give them eternal life they'll never perish it doesn't say anything about what we do doesn't say anything about us now this is the honor and glory of God through Jesus Christ I give them eternal life they will never perish there's he doesn't give any exceptions to that they'll never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand so in other words there's going to be people that seek and there's going to be demon spirits that are going to try to pluck you out of Christ's hand but he says it's impossible the next verse My Father which gave them me is greater than all and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand all right so Jesus says the Son of God says no one I give you eternal life you'll never perish you'll not be plucked out of my hand my father is greater than all no one can pluck them out of his hand what is the next verse I and my father are one we're I Jesus and the father are in unity to the fact of this you'll never be lost you'll never perish that's just one scripture we have many more to talk about as we go on but I want to get back to Hebrews 6. a person that's been given eternal life cannot lose it you'll never perish you'll never be plucked out of his hand secondarily the other point we made is a person certainly can repent and receive restoration you can get saved you can backslide horribly God can call you to repentance and he and you respond with repentance and God will restore you completely how many believe that so we can't take Hebrews 6 to violate that principle of scripture either that's a misunderstanding to say well if someone has true salvation they backslide they're finished brother Luther it's unscriptural Jeremiah chapter 3 verses 12-14 go and Proclaim these words towards the North and say return thou backsliding Israel saith the Lord and I will not cause my anger to fall upon you for I am merciful saith the Lord and I will not keep anger forever only acknowledge thine iniquity that thou Hast transgressed against the Lord thy God and has scattered thy ways to The Strangers under every Green Tree and you have not obeyed my voice saith the Lord turn oh backsliding children saith the Lord for I am married unto you and I will take you one of a city and two of a family and I will bring you to Zion so that's God's heart this is this is a people of course it's speaking of a national identity Israel as as a nation but that's made up of individuals and so he's calling out to those individuals that make up that Nation you're not listening to me you're not hearing my voice you're not responding so my wrath is against you and I'm going to drive you from this land nevertheless he says you backsliders if you repent if you hear my voice you come back I'll receive you I will restore you I'll give you a city Hosea 14 4. I will heal their backsliding I will love them freely for my anger is turned away from him hosea's life is a perfect expression of that Hosea to Marry The Prostitute who kept running away from him and he he kept running after her no matter how rotten she was how terrible she was he kept running after her and that's the heart of God so again we can't take Hebrews 6. and and completely throw God's heart away God's heart is when someone turns to him no matter how bad it is I mean how much worse can you get than what Hosea Gomer did to Hosea and yet you can't get any worse in the relationship of a husband and wife and yet what happened he kept going after her why because it was supposed to express the heart of God first John 1 verse 9. how do we how do we look at and Define backsliding brother Branham says I backslide every day that's that in one sense in another sense you could say you know look at look at the children of Israel they worshiped idols that's like an unto the what happened between Hosea and Gomer they worshiped idols and God said if you'll just hear my voice and repent and come back I'll receive you and I'll bring you to Zion think of God's grace just just just comprehend that for a moment does he anyone that comes to him will he turn them away scripture says he'll anyone that comes to the son I will in no eyes cast out this is God's heart and even somebody says ask brother Brandon a question and answer I I've backslidden I've done terrible things can I come back he says if you want to come back it shows you can come back so again Hebrews 6 is something that many times it's it's absolutely the truth I'm not trying to denigrate the scripture I want you to see the context I'm emphasizing this so that we don't dislocate this scripture from the rest of it so that we do understand God loves the backslider he says I'm married to that backslider and I'm gonna go get that backslider and bring them bring them back because it's my glory at stake he said they'll never perish no one will pluck them out of my hands even if that sheep is doing his best to get lost he says 99 I'm going to leave and I'm going to go find that one and he doesn't it doesn't matter how bruised battered and broken that God himself gets through that he's going to find that sheep because he said I will never lose it so when we when we see this God when we confess our sins he's faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness I don't see any qualification I don't see any well if you do this if well if you did this there's no forgiveness if you did that there's no forgiveness he just says if you confess the only requirement is confession repentance and he will forgive and he's faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us second chronicles 7 14. If my people which are called by my name very famous scripture shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their Wicked Ways then will I hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land that's God's principle he doesn't put a limitation on what the Wicked Ways are look if the Wicked Ways are like just like this then I can then there's forgiveness but if the Wicked Ways are like you know this and this and this never okay you say how about blasphemy of the Holy Spirit there's no forgiveness for that absolutely the truth if you blaspheme the Holy Spirit but the thing is about a person that blasphemed the holy spirit is they remain stubborn and steadfast in their rejection of the work of the Holy Spirit Paul the Apostle says he was a blasphemer Paul blasphemed the Holy Spirit and yet Jesus went after him because he was one of the elect and he forgived forgave his sins so really ultimately to a person that turns to Christ there is no limit to his forgiveness aren't you thankful aren't you glad for that I'm glad for that let's have that towards each other too let's remember that because in Hebrews 6 a person many times Cults use this for fear to control the people if you go out from us if you go if you leave the group there's no repentance there's no there's no forgiveness I'm just telling everyone who's left Bethel Tabernacle and dislikes us and hates us come on back we love you there's forgiveness there's repentance and there's love amongst the people don't let the devil lie to you and say you won't be accepted here the people like me I did too much that's from hell can I can I get a raised hand and an amen to that I wish we had a camera right here to show everyone if they're listening in you're welcome here we love you you might have called us all kinds of names come on back we love you we love you no matter what we want we want to see God's blessing and God's best and we want to see you walking with him in Victory and joy and peace that's God's heart this is God's heart if you don't want to come then don't come nobody's forcing anybody we want to see we don't want to see a bunch of people whose hearts are far from God and living under the thumb of some perception get that perception out of your head the ministry team has no desire for any of this any of that nonsense we just want to see your heart so in love with Jesus Proverbs 24 16. for a just man fallest seven times in that wonderful and riseth up again but the wicked shall fall into mischief let's let's not be so holy around here that we think that you know our ministry team our leaders they never fall and make mistakes we all do but guess what we're getting up again and we're walking forward with God but the wicked fall and they remain where they fell that's the that's the difference everybody falls everybody sins but The Godly they stand up dust themselves off Lord help me I made a mistake I sinned against your word it's a serious thing we don't treat sin lately it's a very serious thing we but we dust ourselves off Lord forgive me cleanse me and we keep walking forward so if you backslide from the faith you can be restored this is not speaking the Hebrews 6 is not speaking of a person that's received genuine salvation and then they go to lose it and then they can't regain it no that's not what it's speaking of so let's look at the context a little bit more Hebrews chapter 6 back to that and we're going to read verses 7 and 8. this is a direct answer I believe to this for the Earth which drinks in the rain that cometh oft upon it and brings forth herbs meat for them by whom it is dressed receives blessing from God but that which Bears thorns and Briars is rejected and is nigh under cursing whose end is to be burned oh my so what are those two verses telling us so the ground what does the ground do when it rains soaks it up when it when it falls when it comes hopefully it soaks it up otherwise you have a flood but under normal circumstances we have that's providing nutrients and strength to the ground so that whatever is in it uh Sprouts comes to life grows so good good we're looking at good ground in verse 7 this is good ground why because it brings forth herbs or it brings forth fruit for the farmer so the per the whom it is dressed that's the farmer and and that good ground brings forth good fruit and receives blessing from God but the evil ground the bad ground the bad field produces thorns and Briars and what the farmer does when his field produces thorns and prayers is he burns it up so it's nigh under cursing who's and whose end is to be burned it's going to be burnt so the context and the bigger picture that Paul is presenting is two kinds of fields one is a good field one is a bad field and so what is what is that outward Force that's coming upon it rain the Bible says the rain falls on the just and the unjust so the same rain that makes the fruit tree grow or the wheat grow also makes the thorns and the thistles grow so it's receiving the same rain these who are once enlightened none of those verses say they had eternal life I mean if we look back at at those verses in Hebrews four through six doesn't say they have eternal life it doesn't say that they have faith which causes them to endure to the end it says they were once enlightened tasted of the Heavenly are they uh made partakers of the Holy Ghost all of these things it speaks about none none of that says they have faith and hope that endureth to the end both Fields have all those five things they have enlightening the Heavenly gift partaking of the Holy Ghost tasting the word of God tasting the powers of the age to come they both experience that anointing but when that anointing comes on the good field it produces good fruit when that anointing comes under thorns and thistles it produces thorns and thistles both Fields experience the rain Matthew 7 21 not everyone that saith had to be Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven in other words it's not merely an outward confession but it's an out it's an outward confession that's accompanied by a life that is living in submission to the will of the father many will say to me in that day Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works then I will profess unto them I never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity so it isn't the one that can produce miracles it isn't the one that can point to something on the outside but it's it's the one that has something on the inside that's producing a life on the outside both groups have Miracles Matthew 7 Mark 16 these signs shall follow them that believe and those who are calling to him Lord Lord but don't do his will also have signs also have miracles in the anointed ones at the end time brother brother Branham says Moses a man sent from God with the word of God and on his journey taking Israel into the Promised Land strictly with the Commandment of God he met another prophet another anointed one that had a genuine anointing of the same holy spirit that was upon Moses that's right he was a prophet the Holy Spirit was upon this man his name was Balaam we're all acquainted with him well the very things the same things that the man said is still taking place about 2 800 years ago Thou Art like a unicorn of Israel whoever blesses you will be blessed but we know that Balaam was a false teacher and what was the fruit that he brought forth in his life Disobedience to God's word where does Jesus draw the difference in Matthew 7. obedience to the word the fruit of your life is obedience to the word you say what in the world does this have to do with backslider you'll see yeah you'll see you'll see the picture trying to do with God a service without it being his will it is possible a man or woman with all sincerity trying their best to do God a service and stirred it in the wrong way listen with a genuine anointing of the Holy Spirit upon them but stirred it contrary to God's plan for the age and Chaos the whole thing now if you believe that's the truth say Amen we just read it chaos the whole thing by not coming God's provided way to do it what's God's provided way to do it by the word it's it's people that they they have the same signs outwardly but what are they doing they're going contrary to the word we're talking about what Hebrews 6 4-6 is talking about a person with an anointing a person that's religious a person a person that looks like they're trying to follow God's word a person that looks looks to me like a Pentecostal charismatic right they've got signs they've got demons being cast out they've got miracles they've got prophecy and we what is it they're contrary to God's original program and what do they do they chaos the whole thing thank you a thinking man's filter brother Branham says notice now woman they want to have bobbed hair they want to wear shorts paint makeup these little bikinis and things that way that they wear nowadays they want to do it and yet they want to go to church you see that anointing upon the spirit not upon the soul so what is the what is what is the difference between the anointing on the spirit and the anointing on the soul the anointing on the soul is what brings transforming power the soul is the nature of the spirit and God wants to get that nature that's inside of the soul to agree with his word and so when the when the true anointing baptism of the Holy Ghost comes upon that Soul it changes everything but when that anointing comes upon the spirit it brings what does it bring it brings change it rings it brings miracles but it doesn't bring transformation on the inside of the inside that brings religion trying to do God of service without it being his will now notice that in this now David thought he had everything in order and he was inspired see how the Holy Spirit can anoint a man but it's got to be in the order of the anointing the outside Spirit can be Anointed with the Holy Ghost and the Soul as dark as pitch my that's exactly what Hebrews 6 is talking about a person that is Anointed and it's a genuine anointing but it's in the wrong place the cockleberg grows on the same water that builds puts life into the wheat puts life into the cockle bird but at the bottom of the cocklebur it's a cocklebur life listen it's rejoicing and blooming and got life and doing everything that the wheat does but the soul of it is cockleberry see false teachers can rise teaching all kinds of trinitarianism and everything else and be Anointed with the Holy Ghost and prefer listen and perform just as many miracles as the true gospel can but by the word here that's what does it see what I mean that's what we we need to be looking at and understanding is we can have wonderful anointings we can have wonderful emotions I'm not against it one bit we should have that amen but the point being is you can also have that and not be right with God not be not have the not have the genuine New Birth not be not be following the truth of the word it can be a deception on the outside that doesn't mean we throw away emotion throw away Supernatural no that follows them that believe but we also understand that's that is the place where the devil will also deceive don't get it out in order and say oh we have Miracles we have signs we have Supernatural we have emotion in our services okay so what we should have that but that's not our absolute the word of God is our absolute and our first let your heart be aligned with the word then let the other things follow that when the anointing comes the enlightenment of the Gospel comes the tasting of the word all these things come and it can anoint the spirit of a man or a woman but not bring a genuine birth in the soul how does it do that very simply put is the only person that can have a genuine birth in the soul is the one that was chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world who's had the seed of God placed in their soul so that when the word is preached the light strikes that seed and it comes to life otherwise there's not a spot for them if you'd read in John 8 Jesus tells the Pharisees my word has no place in you that's why they call him a devil that's why they call him the devil is because the word has no place in them just like if you're trying to send a Wi-Fi signal to a brick it can't receive it but if you have if you have an iPhone maybe an Android sometime to bless your hearts you can receive that signal you can receive that signal in in a phone or a laptop or a tablet or uh or or a computer you can receive that signal there's something in it to receive it but you try to send a Wi-Fi signal to a brick it can't it can't accept it can't take it and that's what the problem is the person can get the anointing on the spirit but there's no place for the word in their soul there's no predestinated seed there so they they get anointed they get religious they shout they speak in tongues they dance in the spirit and so does the real believer but yet what what is the ultimate brother Branham says but by the word here that's what does it not by miracles not by dancing not by tongues but by the word Jesus makes that same exact difference is he that does the will of my father that's the one who will be accepted when they say Lord Lord the Holy Ghost Reign it falls on the wheat seed and produces bread for the master's table the Holy Ghost Reign falls on a Thistle and it produces more thistles that's what it does and that's what Hebrews 6 is talking about he cannot be renewed again to repentance because there's no spot for repentance in him Esau he repented with tears right but he didn't find it no why because he wasn't predestinated to find it Jacob have I loved Esau have I hated Jacob could repent though it was a long time before he did finally repent he finally did repent Esau tried to but couldn't find it isn't it interesting well that's not fair God's not fair who are you the thing form to say to him that formed it why have you made me thus God is the Potter you're the clay you can't change a wheat into a thistle God has ordained it to be a wheat it will be a wheat no matter no matter how messed up it grows this direction that direction it's always going to be a wheat it might not be a very fruitful wheat but it'll still be a wheat right if it's a thistle you're not going to make bread from it I'm sorry as hard as you want as bad as you want to try you cannot it's not ordained to produce bread and it cannot repent it cannot be renewed to repentance because it can never do it in the first place in the indictment brother Branham says notice this they crucify to themselves the son of God afresh what did they do what by having a taste and knowing that it's at the it's the truth and then turn around and denying it what did it do it's impossible right so they they taste it they see it they see the Vindicated word brother Branham took this Hebrews 6 and brought it into something that was applied in the last age to the church age and the denominational system then and the people in it what did they do they crucified the word of God afresh by denying it they see it manifested they say oh that's a genuine Prophet yeah the Pentecostals did anyways but don't listen to the word don't take the word the very reason the Miracles came was to point us to the word that's out that's always to have preeminence any real brother bam says any real miracles of god produces a message so does that mean that someone that leaves the message says they don't don't agree with it can never come back that's again this is not talking about the predestinated seed this is not talking about the wheat plant that produces the bread on the master's table it's talking about a cocklebur Hebrews 6 9 but beloved again we're continuing the context he's talking about he talks about the two fields and we read about that and he says but beloved oh now who are we talking to we're talking to the Beloved the Beloved of God the elect of God we are persuaded better things of you and things that a company salvation though we thus speak you see this warning he's put the warning before him but he says there's better things for you I know I know that there's better things for you things that accompany salvation I like that we realize that there's things that accompany salvation there's things that go along with it if you have salvation there's things that accompany that it's not just salvation and there's no accompaniment to it there's salvation and things follow for God is not unrighteous to forget your work again he's not he's not going off and jumping off to a different subject he's talking about the same subject and he's trying to point out here is what I'm talking about here is the good fruit that the good field produces for God is Not unrighteousness unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love which you have showed towards his name in that you have ministered the Saints and do Minister and we desire that every one of you do show the same diligence to the full Assurance of Hope to unto the end that you be not slothful but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises that's that that list of things that Paul is speaking about is quite different than the other list that he spoke about the ones enlightened tasting of the good word of God and and so forth and the powers of the age to come this one is speaking of things that accompany salvation it's one thing it's one thing to be religious it's one thing to have an anointing it's one thing to make a profession an outward profession I believe this message I believe in Jesus Christ I believe he's the same yesterday today and forever fantastic that's tasting that's being enlightened but that's not the same thing as the things that accompany salvation a true experience of eternal life a true experience with the person of eternal life produces these things we're reading about here what what does he say I'm God is not unrighteousness to forget your work your effort that word literally means effort so this is company salvation what a company salvation effort and labor of love the word labor there literally refers to troubles and trials so in other words the troubles and the trials that you face because of love and he says which you have showed towards his name towards the Lord Jesus Christ how so in that you have ministered that you've served the Saints and do serve so these are the things again reminding you they accompany salvation true salvation is accompanied by what Paul is pointing out right here and we desire that everyone you show the same diligence oh there's diligence diligence for what diligence to the full Assurance of Hope to the end in other words there's some something inside of you when you've received salvation it brings a diligence that brings you to that complet complete assurance you have completed your Assurance of the word of God because God cannot lie his promises never fail so I can have hope to the end again hope is not just a wish in the Bible hope is an Earnest expectation an Earnest expectation of what just some random thoughts that you had no an Earnest expectation of God's promises that he's made to you that you're going to endure to the end that he you don't have to you don't have to be in fear and worry oh I wonder if I'm one of those that's just been enlightened and tasted the good word of God and and I'm just going to ultimately fall away and know I believe God's promises I will be there at the end not because of anything I do but because the work that he's doing in me that you be not slothful you're not lazy so this is something that accompanies salvation it takes away all laziness slothfulness from you it causes you to be a follower of the Believers from the past that we have the example in the scriptures that they through faith and patience inherit the promises even the ones that never in this lifetime inherited them but We'll Inherit them in the age that is to come Abraham never got even a little bit of land had to buy just a burial spot that's really his only possession in the Promised Land but he endured with patience to the end a lot of mistakes did Abraham make a lot of mistakes God didn't account that to them he was faithful through faith and patience he inherited the promises what was the secret to Abraham we told you that before he fell down seven times and rose up eight amen so that that is that that is a great great difference between the one who's anointed merely on the outside and the one who is truly changed who has experienced genuine salvation Matthew 10 verse 22. I hope this is an encouragement to you and you shall be hated of all men for my name's sake but he that endureth to the end shall be saved you're going to be persecuted you're going to face trials and difficulties bad things are going to happen because of your faith sometimes sometimes you see people say well you know I if I do this if you know for example if I wear a skirt at work it's going to cause me troubles okay isn't that going to cause isn't being having faith in Christ didn't he say it wasn't cause everybody trouble he didn't say I've come so that your life would be so easy he said I didn't come to bring peace but a sword and so yes there's P abiding peace on the inside contrary to the circumstances we face on the outside amen but he that endures till the end will be saved so that looks to me like a conditional promise of salvation it isn't a conditional promise of salvation but it's saying there's things that accompany salvation if you have salvation you will endure to the end again in our in our picture in Hebrews 6 it's not speaking of a backsiding believer that tries to repent it's speaking of a cocklebur that bears evil fruit in their life they believe with all their heart this is what brother branham's presenting it as if you go back look at anointed ones at the end time and the vision that the lord gave to him when he went to those Pentecost that Pentecost his first Pentecostal meeting he was shown and it's clear this is someone who believes they're doing right they believe they've got the real anointing they believe they're going in the right way but their life is producing something different remember the story about the two people one was speaking in tongues wasn't one was interpreting brother has brother Branham has the vision he sees one their life they're godly people another one he's running with some other woman both anointed but them but the man thinks he's right and he's hiding his sinful life a Believer a believer that falls is always welcome to repent by God if but if you do have salvation it's going to produce something in your life ultimately again there's ups and downs in everyone's life we see that clearly by example in the scripture there's falling there's failing if there wasn't there'd be no need for John to write if we confess our sins he's faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness that would be unneeded because we as soon as you get the Holy Ghost you're perfect and you never sin the rest of your life well in God's eyes you never sin in the first place but that's not because of you that's because of the blood of Jesus Christ that was shed for you and you put your faith and trust in him only then that's washed away but by Our Lives we experience we we sin we have a a sticky nature and we'll have that until we have a new body but if you do have salvation it's producing the life of Jesus Christ in you II Timothy 2 verse 13. I have always read this scripture and it just continually stuns me if we believe not he's writing to Christians if we believe not yet he abides faithful he cannot deny himself people try to reinterpret this and say well you know if if you're not if you're not a Believer it doesn't affect God he's still faithful well why does he say he cannot deny himself at the end this the issue is himself him denying himself so in other words you as an elected child of God you might come to this place where your faith is so weak I came to this place about a year ago faith is so weak you couldn't trust God for anything right you're almost dead I I was laying in that hospital so weak my faith was I was I felt like I was in darkness what what did God do he couldn't deny himself God sent Mercy I love I love the expression God doesn't just throw uh throw a life vest to us in the ocean that's not our predicament we're not just lost in the ocean we're actually a dead body at the bottom of the ocean God dives off the ship to the Bottom of the Sea grabs our dead body brings us up to the shore and breathes new life into us and I feel like that's what the Lord did for me I I was I was done but he's faithful even when we're not faithful even when our faith is weak he cannot deny himself that's the god that we serve that's the god that we love he why why does he say he cannot deny himself because you're a part of him you're a part of his life if he denied you he would be literally denying himself isn't that glorious Philippians 1 6. and I am sure of this I'm sure of this Paul was sure of this that he who began a good work in you will be faithful to complete it until the day of Jesus Christ will bring it to completion he he is he started the work did you start the work did you call yourself did you call yourself to Faith did you search and find and look for God everywhere you could go I was running from God and God was running after me that was my experience I wasn't searching I was fighting my way as hard away from God as I could and God was fighting as hard as he could to grab me and open my eyes and open my ears and changed my life and that's what he did it was literally nothing that I did he chased me he caught me God never fails at his work does he he caught me he started the work I'm not the one that started it I'm not the one that's doing it and I'm not the one that's going to finish it he started it everyone has to remember that if he hasn't started the work in in you there's an altar there's a there's a place you can come to come to the Lord give your heart to him you know and and all it took for me I remember driving down the road on on the way home from a meal with friends that were talking to me about The Bible and I just said Lord I want to live for you and from that point all the burdens left my shoulders and my desire was for him I had a lot of problems I had to face I had a lot of transformation that I needed in my life but he he has done it and he's still doing it and he's going to do it until the day of Jesus Christ that's God's ultimate work in you and me I I cannot keep myself if it was up to me I would certainly Fall Away my faith would go weak and I would just go after the desires of the flesh but there's something on the inside of the inside that's preventing me from ever doing that some of my favorite verses series of verses in the entire Bible here in Romans 8. after he began he explains predestination and the fact that we're predestined to be conformed to the image of Christ Paul then says this what shall we then say to these things what do we say now if God be for us who can be against us he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect it's God that justifieth who is he that condemns it's Christ that died yea rather that is risen again who's even at the right hand of God who also makes intercession for us who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or Peril or sword I mean that's some heavy stuff that's some serious difficulties spoken of right there even the sword that comes to chop our head off is not going to separate you from the love of Christ it might separate your head from your body but it's still not going to separate you from the love of Christ as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us I want you to see this what is a conqueror another way to say a conqueror is an overcomer why are we Overcomers what's the whole context of what he's talking about now he's not jumping to another subject he's talking about the same thing why are we Overcomers because nothing can separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus that's why you're a conqueror that's why you overcome that's why you defeat the enemy because nothing could separate you from him from his love God it's God that justify us who is the one that condemns it's Christ that died nothing can separate you from that not even you sometimes we try hard but it's still not going to happen for I'm persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord nothing there's no devil in hell there's no person on this planet that can take you away from his love and there's a lot that goes along with that that doesn't mean you can live any kind of life if you're if you have the love of God in your heart it constrains you to live a pleasing life to him so part part of this the love of God keeping us to the very end and nothing separating from that is the work that he's doing in our life again you know it's it's easy you know that you can become a a super calvinist and say hey I don't I can just I just believe and live any kind of life no if you believe it produces a different kind of life and it doesn't take it you you put your effort you put your strength you put your whole life into it but at the end you realize that the whole thing was God moving inside of you Paul made the statement that I work I work harder than all of the other POS the apostles and what is what is his next statement yet not I but Christ the grace of God in Me and so that's what's working the grace of God is Not merely a nice saying that says he passes over your sins or he has his favor on you but the Grace Grace speaks of him putting his Supernatural effort in power in your life to change you Grace means favor but when that favor is on you his hand is on you you know we read we read in in uh I think it's I think it's Psalm 34. though I could be wrong about David who he David says his hand was Heavy upon me my moisture is turned into the drought of Summer and yet the first verse is starts out in that chapter blessed is the man whose transgression Is Forgiven amen whom the Lord to whom the Lord does not impute sin but what preceded that was David keeping silence David not repenting not confessing his sin to the Lord so God put his hand heavy upon Him David falls into depression falls into sorrow what was that depression and sorrow that David went through that was God's love that was God's love to get him to open his mouth and confess his sin and repent to the Lord so that he could experience the blessing of being the man whom God does not impute sin to doesn't say that the man is sinless but it says the man doesn't have his sins counted to his account Psalm 34 verse 22 and the ESV says the Lord redeems the life of his servants none of those who take refuge in him will be condemned isn't that beautiful that that that goes to our Point earlier if you have a heart to run and take refuge in Christ you won't be turned away you won't be pushed away you won't be condemned the Lord will redeem you it's the Lord's work salvation is of the Lord again he starts it he's doing it and he completes it John 6 39. and this is the Father's will which has sent me that of all which he has given me I should lose nothing but should raise it up again at the last day is Jesus going to lose anything he says you'll lose nothing so there's there's no way you can fall away from genuine salvation and this is the will of him that sent me that everyone which seeth the son and believes on him may have everlasting life and I will raise him up at the last day this is a promise this is a promise this is not a maybe this is not an if this is his work this is what he accomplishes he will do it Ephesians 4 30 musicians if you'd come and do not grieve the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed until the day of your Redemption we certainly can grieve the Holy Spirit right otherwise Paul what what's the point of saying it we can do things in our lives we can have certain attitudes and it Grieves the influence of the holy spirit away from us but it doesn't grieve the holy spirit away from you because if you're sealed with it you're sealed until the very end but you can do things that grieve the Holy Spirit and that Holy Spirit is going to lay his hand heavy on you and he's going to lead you to repentance that's his love again it's don't get these things out of order don't get predestination out of order that somehow you can live any kind of life and you're going to make it in the end the true and you'll have ups and downs no question don't if you believe if you love the Lord Jesus with all your heart you'll be saved you will be don't but don't think that that doesn't carry consequences in it remember there's things that accompany salvation okay so you're you're saved then what your life just looks like the world no there's many things and we didn't get to the scriptures I've got probably 40 more Pages here so whenever I preach text I'll finish it but there's many more things we can look at and see but the react this is the thing is that when you believe when you have real salvation your faith again is not your work your something that you did it's by grace are you save through faith that not of yourselves it's the gift of God not of Works lest any man should boast go go back further what we talked about it's the seed predestinated seed being in the soul when the word comes to that it quickens it to life then there's ups and downs there's struggles there's trials but God is the one keeping you to the end if you can explain your life by your own by your own and your your walk with God by your own merits by Your Own Strength it's very doubtful you have the Life of Christ I personally can't explain what the Lord has done in my life how he's led me how he's kept me through all that we've all that all the ups and downs and the trials and tribulations he is I can't explain this he who began a good work in me will be faithful to complete it until the day of Jesus Christ you you that have that hope inside of yourself the Bible says you'll purify yourself even as he is pure that that word in you produces a life yes you can fall away yes you can make terrible mistakes terrible what did David do he was a predestinated seed of God no he didn't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost but he committed adultery and murder and covered the whole thing up with a conspiracy and what did he do he repented and God received his repentance so we can go through all kinds of ups and downs but it shouldn't be in our heart to want to do that our heart will run from that turn from that and yet if you do God is there if you just turn to him if you say Lord I was wrong I said I sinned I made a terrible mistake please forgive me he will absolutely forgive you we we know that's the truth in the promise of god let's stand up we'll pray Heavenly Father we're so thankful and so grateful for your word Lord I pray this would be a encouragement and a strengthening to Believers Lord I pray that it would be a challenge to anyone who would be hearing and doesn't have a genuine experience of the baptism of the Holy Ghost in their soul lord I pray that even even as my words are going forth now that people will be
