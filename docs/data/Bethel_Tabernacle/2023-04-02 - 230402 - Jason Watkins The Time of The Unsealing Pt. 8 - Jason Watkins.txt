It's It's very scary to stand here. I have to just say this. I don't It's never easy for me to be up here. I'm not a a singer. But I did promise the Lord years ago if he gave me a song that I would do my best to sing it. even if I have a heart attack. But about three weeks ago, this song just started kind of dropping into my heart and I have not been able to get away from it. And it's been really weird just the things that he's kept putting right in front of my face. And so I know that this is him and I pray that it'll be a blessing. And it just came from the inspiration of that that vision that brother Brandham had of us at the end. And we know that's right where we're standing. And I just feel like we have to really step back and take a really close look at what he said because it's life or death. So I pray that I can sing this. When the enemy comes in like a flood, God will raise a standard. I'll just sing it acappella. I'm sorry. I haven't practiced with anyone. Hello. When the enemy [singing] comes in like a flood, God will raise a standard. [singing] His wife is to be set apart. [singing] She is like no other. She has no desire for this world. its music or its fashions. She has become his word made flesh. She [singing] is now his standard. So when the world comes in like a flood, [singing] God will raise a standard. His bride is to be set apart. heart. [singing] She is like no other. She has no desire for this world, [singing] its music or its fashions. She has become his word made flesh. [singing] She is now his standard. [singing] So when the world comes in like a flood. So when the world comes in like a flood, will you compromise dancing to the worldly beat? [singing] A Christian in disguise. Won't you turn your eyes on him and hurry back in line? Onward Christian solders is our battle cry. So when the world [singing] comes in like a flood, God will raise [singing] a standard. His bride is to be set apart. She is like no other. She has no desire for this world. She's marching to a different drummer. She has become his word made flesh. She is now his standard. So when the world's pressing in on you, will [singing] you compromise? Dancing to the worldly beat. Confusion in your mind. But won't you turn your eyes on him and quickly get in step? [singing] Onward Christian soldiers is our [singing] battle cry. So when the world comes in like a flood, [singing] will we be a standard? Will we turn our eyes on him and quickly get in [singing] line when the world comes in like a flood? I want to be a standard. [applause] Amen. Amen. How many of us appreciate that? Amen. Amen. [clears throat] Brother Joe Harell, if you come and give us a song also this morning. Amen. Let's give him a hand. [applause] [music] Amen. I certainly want to be his standard. Certainly appreciated [music] that song, Sister Sharon. That was that was beautiful, too. Our young people, I tell you, I was so encouraged the other night. We were at brother Brad's and we had a good turnout. And you know, the main theme that they had, which really [music] really encouraged me, was to see that they had a such a desire to see their friends come to the Lord. such a desire [music] to see the the ones who aren't here anymore to reach out to them and and the ones maybe that are here that are drifting a little bit to beckon them come on up a little higher. I tell you what, that's just my goodness, it [music] just encouraged me so good. So, we need to pray for our young people and just hold them up. You don't think you [music] didn't have time to run over? All right, you can do that. Y'all pray for us this morning. You love him. Is it up? Good. In the Bible, we read [singing] how Lazarus was laid at the rich man's gate, [music] full [singing] of sores, desiring the crumbs that [music] fell [singing] from the rich man's plate. [music] When he died, he was carried by angels to the [singing] bosom of Abraham. [music] And although he was poor in heaven, I'm sure that there's not a rich man. [music] Cuz it don't take this world's possessions. [music] No [singing] money that I'll have to pay. [music] It just took the blood of God's only [singing and music] son to wash all my sins away. And I don't have [music] much longer to stay here. My race [music] is almost run. And [music] Lord, you know I've seen better days, but the best is [music and singing] yet to come. [music] [music] My pockets aren't filled with money and I [music] don't wear the ladies styles. And the house [music] that I live in is old and run down. But that's all right. It'll do [music] for a while cuz soon I'll inherit a mansion [singing] [music] that never will decay. And [music and singing] I'll wear a white robe and a crown of glory that faded [music] not away. Cuz it don't take this world's possessions. [music] No money that I'll [singing] have to pay. It just [music] took the blood of God's only son to wash all my [music] sins away. And I don't have much longer to stay here. My race is almost [singing] [music] run. And Lord, you know I've seen [music and singing] better days, but the best is yet to come. [music] And Lord, you know I've seen [singing] better days, but the best [music] is yet to come. [applause and music] How many's ready for the word? Amen. Let us stand. Amen. I want to greet all the guests again. Amen. Greetings. Now, there's a rule. The first time that you're here, [music] you're guest. The second time, your family. Amen. Amen. Let's give the Lord one more hand. Amen. [music and applause] Hearts and minds ready for the word. Amen. Amen. This because he lives, I can face tomorrow. God sent his son. They called him Jesus. He [music] [singing] came to love, heal, and forive. He bled and died to [music] and [music] grave my savior lives. [music] Because he lives, I give [music] face to [music] lives. All fear is gone [music] because I know [music] he holds my [singing] life [music] Heat. Heat. [music and singing] [music] That's right. [music] [music] I [music] know. Oh, yes. I know. I [music] now [music] [singing] [music] give the Lord a hand this morning. Hallelujah. [music] [applause] Thank you, Lord Jesus. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Amen. God bless you all. Smiling faces and enjoying all that worship in the back. Enjoy all those specials. Amen. Praise God. We're going to invite you right to the book of Hebrews, chapter 12 this morning. Amen. Glad to be in the house of God on a beautiful sunny Sunday. Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. Enjoying all of these uh wonderful songs. My just such a treat for me in the back. And Amen. And I I get to hear it right when I walk in the side door. I could hear Anthony back there with his band. They were jumping and it was sounding good. [laughter] And then um Amen. I was able to uh catch brother Jason Sunday school from the back. I think it's quite a profound thought. My I I I I thought to myself, JD, as you were the way you go about it, I it made me think about the I don't remember if it's in the um I think it's like on the back of the book where other people write about this person who wrote the book. And if you go I think it's I know it's the book Christ the Healer. And I think that one of the things on the back that some other minister, some renowned man of that of that era, he said, he said to the effect, he said, "Brother Bosworth has made this topic of divine healing so tight, it's just so proven, there's no way anyone, he just has went over the top with it. There's no way anyone could refute it." Amen. Not with your Not with your Bible, anyway. Praise the Lord. Amen. So, I I was thinking about that, Brother Jay, as you were covering that so thoroughly, back and forth, back and forth, back and forth, not afraid to take on the challenges and the questions that you you see in the world today. Just taking them head on. Amen. I think that that's magnificent. Amen. Hebrews chapter 12. Hebrews [clears throat] chapter 12. The time of the unsealing part eight won't get finished. Already know it. Oh, well, so so much for numericics, but anyway, we're just going to carry on uh in the Lord and carry on with whatever the Lord has for us. Amen. You love the word. It's been a great thrill to me to have this series because it's such a my such a monumental moment that we have arrived at in human history as the Bible refers to the there's a generation upon whom the ends of the earth have come and we believe that we are that generation. We believe it because God has sent a message that he promised he would send right at that time and we have that and so we're very much thrilled with that this morning. Amen. Visi u greetings to our visitors in the back there. God bless you. We're happy to have you all here today. Amen. Hebrews chapter 12 um verse one. I'm not going to keep you standing for the whole reading because we're going to read pretty much that entire chapter. But let's just catch a little bit. I'm going to let you be seated. Wherefore, seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us. Do you find it amazing that Paul would need to say that to believers? He's not, this isn't a this isn't a an outreach campaign where they're in the hedges and highways. He's talking to his own countrymen who have believed on the Lord. And he's saying, since we are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight and the sin which doth so easily. Can you imagine that can be true about believers? So easily beset us. And let us run with patience the race that is set before us, looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, [clears throat] despising the shame, and is sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds. Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin. This is my favorite passage to go to when I find people in a pity party. My favorite one. This is like knocks them out. It's right between the eyes. You haven't yet suffered under blood. You know, many have. Many millions have. You haven't. So get over yourself. Stand up. Dust yourself off. God still loves you. Don't think of trials, even the fiery ones, as strange. They're for your good. So press on. Get back in line. Get back in step. Press on. All right. Think about him who endured such a well, they did me wrong. Think about what a contradiction that Jesus accepted on himself. The perfectly innocent being condemned by the totally guilty. You talking about being done wrong. Wow. So [clears throat] verse five. And you have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children. My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him. For whom the Lord loveth, he chastineth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth. If he endure chastening, God deleth with you as with sons. For what son is he whom the father chastineth not? All right. But if you be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then you're bastards and not sons. Furthermore, we have had we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us, and we gave them reverence. Shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the father of spirits and live? That's a pretty good reward, isn't it? Amen. For verily for a few days uh for a few days chastening for they verily for a few days chasened us after their own pleasure. But in other words, how they thought best. didn't always get it right. Amen. I'm a dad. I know I didn't get always get it right. Glad my boys still love me. Amen. [clears throat] Amen. No, their wives are saying, "Oh, they deserved it." Amen. Now, no chastening. Here's a here's a a common sense thing. Now, no chastening for the present seemth to be joyous. Paul understands you're a human. He understands suffering is real and sadness and sorrow. It's not that we don't sorrow. We just don't sorrow as the world who has no hope. See, so he says, he says, "Now, no chastening for the present seemth to be joyous, but grievious. Nevertheless, that notwithstanding, I'm not denying that that's true. However, afterward, it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby. Wherefore, because of this, having known this, now that you get it, lift up holy hands which hang down, and the feeble knees, and make here here's a lesson. Make straight paths for your feet. I'm tired of getting chastised. Make straight paths. Amen. Man, I was talking to a sister the other day and I said, "Look, sis, here's a here's a lesson, life lesson for you. The quickest way to a trial or a test is fail one. I promise you'll get it again and again and again and again until you pass it." See, so make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is lame be turned out of the way, but but let it rather be healed. Let it allow it. Permit it to be. You have to do that. You have to allow the word to dwell in you richly. You have to let the mind which was in Christ be in you. You have to uh you know allow yourself to look from his perspective. Amen. Amen. Make straight paths for your feet lest that which is lame be turned out of the way, but let it rather be healed. have a number of prayer requests I want to pray for. Um, brother Chris St. John was sick today. Brother Brad has been sick. Brother Bradley, he came actually I met him. He was coming in the parking lot. He come in, felt too bad. Went home to lay down his streaming today. Sister Kathy still recovering. Brother Jack. Amen. And um and uh seemed like I had uh one more. Um let me see who it was. Um yes uh Sister Amber um she's still devil's still attacking her. So we're praying for that as well. Uh we've had a wonderful time in the men's Thursday night prayer meeting. Brothers, that has been a wonderful thing, hasn't it? I tell you that has that has done so much for my heart. We were gathered, a good-sized group of us here were gathered Thursday night and we were praying and we got a text from a sister uh who streams us from California and has rededicated her heart to the Lord and streams us and she sent in a prayer request. Brother Jason, I was just praying for the brothers at the Thursday night prayer meeting and I want to put in my request and every one of us, all of us men, we had to fight back tears to thank here's a lady in California who's just streaming and and it's on her heart to get down and pray for the brothers who are gathering on Thursday night. Oh my, it just thrilled me so much. Amen. So, let's take these requests to the Lord and uh ask for his blessing. Father, we thank you for your love and your kindness to us. Lord God, I thank you for your word that's been read now. We know there's a blessing in reading it and a blessing in hearing it read. We know your word is already anointed. It's we Lord who need thy anointing. I pray that you will bless speaker and hearer Lord as we speak from our heart today and [clears throat] give it give it Lord may I give it uh in the way that I received it and let it flow me taking no thought Lord not not to avoid my preparation but no thought of how I'm going to make it go or how far I'm going to go I want you to be in control of that Lord I commit it to you master these sick and afflicted among us Lord we re ask you to remember them especially right now that you would speed healing Lord into their bodies. We commit it to you now in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you as you're seated. [clears throat] Oh, so brother Donald, I'm sorry, Deb. I didn't see that in time. Brother Donald at home not feeling well also. Let's uh be remembering him apparently. Um so the um brother Luther, I guess the basket's just at the back. Uh you didn't they didn't call you forward um to make you round. So God bless you. That's all right. Um yes, thank you. Um we want to just be praying for uh William. Y'all remember William. He's almost like a fourth son to me. Has been for years. called me dad for years. And uh he he has visited quite a bit. And uh his mother, Sister Connie, who also many of us know went on to her reward to be with the Lord. You know, uh we're not sad for her. Uh happy days for her. My but uh you know, we want to be praying for William and for brother Wayne at this time and that family. Lord, keep them very near. Amen. [clears throat] All right. So looking now from our from our text, let's go back and let's finish reading from verse uh 15 or verse 14, I'm sorry. Follow peace with all men and holiness without which no man shall see the Lord. always puzzles me that at every Hollywood funeral, uh, they've got the people who live the most adulterous, um, you know, low moral lifestyle and they're all in heaven looking down. To which I go, "Wow, I'd like to hope that, but I mean, what about what about this? That without holiness, no man shall see God." And I'm sorry, but there there's not going to be like the world thinks. An angel stepping out on a cloud blowing a trumpet. An es golden escalator drops down. Jesus descends like Donald Trump and takes us all home. Takes the whole world home. Oh, we're all going home now. That's not going to happen. That's a fairy tale. Yes. Amen. First of all, the rapture is a secret happening that the world's unaware even happening until after the fact. We're gone for quite a while before the foolish virgin even realized we're gone. Amen. So, so we realize that without holiness, no man shall see the Lord. Looking diligently, lest any man fail of the grace of God, lest any root of bitterness spring up trouble you. This is to believers. and thereby many be defiled, lest there be any fornicator or profane person as Esau, who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright, for you know how that afterward, when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no place of repentance. Catch it, though he sought it carefully with tears. Amen. You see, so in order to repent, the the door of repentance has to be opened to you. You can't just decide to love God. The love of God has to be poured into your heart by the Holy Ghost. You can't just decide, I'm gonna I'm gonna go to heaven. You don't. That that doesn't work. You have to be first invited. Say, well, Jesus invited the whole world. Well, he died for the whole world. And every man does get a does have an opportunity to give his heart to the Lord and accept the free pardon. Uh but but you have to remember that, you know, you do have to accept it. A pardon's not a pardon unless it's accepted as that. And then when you repent, that means you turn your life around. That means you don't live the same kind of life anymore. You're a new creation. So he says here, now watch, though he sought it carefully with tears, for ye are not come unto mount unto the mount that might be touched and that burned with fire. This is Sinai. nor under blackness and darkness and tempest, and the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words, which voice they that heard intreated, that the word should not be spoken to them anymore. For they could not endure that which was commanded. And if so much as a beast touched the mountain, it shall be stoned or thrust through with a dart. So terrible was the sight that Moses said, "I exceedingly fear and quake. You're not you're not come to that mountain. Verse 22. But ye are come unto Mount Zion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem. Now, you'll notice there's a difference in the language here between Hebrews 12 and Revelation 21 where in in there you have a a holy uh Jerusalem. Here you you find him saying this is the heavenly Jerusalem but there it's a holy Jerusalem because there's John said there was no temple there. See because the lamb and the light are the are the lamb is the light thereof. And we find that the that the temple is God's family him dwelling in them. That's why when John was told by the angel holding one holding that seventh vial, "Come and I'll show you the bride, the lamb's wife." Well, when he took him to show him the bride, the lamb's wife, he saw the city. See, so that's that's holy Jerusalem. Why? This is heavenly Jerusalem that which you are already seated together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. Here here's how you know it. This is the heavenly Jerusalem. Verse 23, to the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven, and to God the judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect, and to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of Abel. See that you refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth, much more shall we shall not we escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven. Whose voice then shook the earth. All right, that was Sinai. But now he hath promised, saying, yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also heaven. And this word yet once more signifth. Here's what it means by saying yet once more. It means that there's a removing of those things that are shaken as of things that are made. That those things which cannot be shaken may remain. Amen. And that's what you find in a new heavens and a new earth once you break into Revelation chapter 21. Now it's making uh it's describing God dealing being with mankind in a way that it has never been before in all the Bible that it says God himself will dwell with men. So he's not coming to dwell in an office. He's always dwelt in an office. But this is now God tabernacling himself in his family. See? And so we're with Jesus who's the beginning of this new family and the pillar of fire above him. That doesn't make a second God or a third God. That means it's the one God above all, through all and in you all. Amen. And that's what we're coming to. That's the surrendering of the kingdom. Say for brother Jay was dealing with that uh Wednesday. The surrendering of the kingdom. The son surrenders up the kingdom to the father. That doesn't make two lords. That's an incorrect doctrine. That's what it is is a surrendering of the office. Now it's God. [screaming] God himself shall dwell with men. And there was no temple there because why? You are the temple. You say, "How did I get there? [screaming] You're being built into it now. You're lively stones. You're being fashioned and crafted by the word of God. No wonder only the bride goes in the rapture because she is a word bride. She's not a denominational theory. She's not a concept. She's not something that that uh that 33,000 different denominations said was the bride. There's been [screaming] brides, brides, churches, churches, brides, churches, brides. But at the end, there had to come a real one. That's the promise in the Bible that at the last day there would be a real one in the earth. Should be a very small number. And God would send a message with a messenger with a message that would call her [screaming] out of the church and and and dress her in the garments of the word and she it is who will receive the sleeping saints. She alone and the world will spin off into chaos. So this is why verse 28 is so vital. Amen. Wherefore, in other words, having said everything that I just said, this is Paul now, having said everything that I just said to you about, you know, trials and tribulations come for your good, set straight paths before your feet. See, you you're not come to Sinai anymore. You're not coming to something some man-made. That that whole law was never that was not God's plan. That was the people's plan. They wanted that. They already had the pillar of fire. Why would you want a law? They had the they had the prophet. They had the pillar of fire. Why would What would you want with a man-made system that you can't keep anyway? See, and so you know, but he's saying we're not doing that again. The New Testament era is not going to be about that. God is the Holy Ghost isn't coming to give control of the church to groups of men or women. He's coming to be the head of his own church. Amen. And he draws her aside by the word of God. Wherefore we receive a kingdom, there it is. A kingdom which cannot be moved. Let us have grace whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear. So we receive a kingdom. That's why it's now God in in the new heavens in the new earth after the millennium after the devil's been destroyed. Death and hell have been cast into the lake of fire. There's nothing evil. All evil people, all evil demons, all the evil devil. They've all been annihilated. See, as as brother Jason was showing this morning, only God can do that. See, because don't forget Lucifer has a soul. It's what made him a free moral agent. Right? And so God will destroy him and death and hell and the false prophet. And everything is cast in the lake of fire, after the judgment, which is after the millennium, which is after the tribulation, which is after we leave. Amen. Like like dominoes going in reverse. But they're going to go this way. And I'm here to tell you, once once Revelation chapter 21 breaks open, everything God at that time fills all time, space, and eternity. Everything in existence is a pure expression of him. And and and and he is a pure expression of everything that's in existence. Amen. What a day that will be. That's a kingdom. That's a kingdom coming. We are here today preparing for that kingdom. If you want to go, do you want to go? Good news. [screaming] I got a road map today. Good news. I got coordinates, good news. You can you can meet and and you say, "Where where where does the road begin?" You know, in in Bunan's story of the pilgrim's progress, it began at the wicked gate. I'm here to tell you, it begins at Calvary. And from there, it just goes on and on [screaming] and on and on till one day, we're going to stand with glorified bodies like he has. We have showed you in the past and I'm going to really pace myself on time because I'm not trying to get finished. I'm just going to watch the clock and go to a to a if you would just give me your undivided attention 55 60 minutes. Uh I'm going to try to stop because I suffered quite a bit from last Sunday. It was a joyful suffering. I was smiling but I was also hurting. Amen. is, you know, gave me a chance to get at the devil. I like it. I hate that guy. I want to kill him. I want I want the Lord to kill him and I want to watch. Amen. If you if you've been around the world as I have and seen the suffering I've seen over decades, you'd be wanting to stand at the edge of the of the pit, too. You'd be wanting to stand right there, toss him. Amen. Oh my. Hey, you say that's that's sadistic. The Bible says that all heaven was rejoicing and the word of God says rejoice. Hallelujah. [screaming] For your enemies destroyed and they they worshiped God because he had destroyed the devil. Hallelujah. My they were celebrating it. So we find that God is a consuming fire. So we have talked to you in times past of how when we're talking about the operation of the kingdom, the operation of the kingdom is the operation of third pull. For us at this stage, it's a coming kingdom. It's a coming world. What are we doing here? How do we get there? God has sent a message that went through three pools and we are coming to that third one. We are in it. That is the opening of the word. We have been in it since the day when the seven seals were broken and loosed to us. And we are now uh uh eating our way to a body change as it were. You can see as as brother Brandon would say that he he hid it all through the Bible taught us that it wasn't written but it was he did he didn't show it but he did show it in the lives of the people and we started back with Abraham and we showed you there was no difference in a prophet in the woods saying a squirrel will be here or Abraham saying that that the the Lord shall provide a lamb. And it that was impossible. And Abraham didn't take one with him, but he spoke. And and and lo and behold, maybe even Abraham didn't even know. I'm here to tell you something, friends. I'm not here to tell you you're always going to be aware of it. But if if your life is dedicated to God, and you're living, as a prophet said, in those spheres with God, and you're totally sold out, whatever you face, there's going to be a word that's going to come through you, and you'll say, "Oh, that was me." And it's not going to be you. It's going to be him. Amen. See, and so this this this was seen there because that's Genesis 1 power. Jesus didn't even operate that. He had that power, but he never operated it. He always made something from something. He never created something out of thin air. He hadn't done that since he created the world, the heavens and the earth, which Ephesians shows us that it was all created and done by Jesus Christ. so long before his he was born of a woman. So we find out then that he was the genesis of the spoken word and that he's he shows a demonstration of it in Abraham. And then and then this is exactly one of the reasons why Jesus said as it was in the days of Lot and in the days of Noah. Now notice he didn't say in the days of Abraham or in the days of Enoch because that's God's family. He's the warning in Matthew in in Luke 17 and Matthew 24 is warnings of the wickedness of the end time. And here's what you want to be on the lookout for. When you see the evil of Lot's day and the evil of Noah's day, then understand that Enoch was already on the scene and there's already a capstone. There's already a visitation. By the time Lot uh by the time Sodom is destroyed, Abraham has already met Melzdc and he's already done the impossible in Abraham's life. And I just say, Lord, that's what I need. I need you to do what seems to be impossible for me. I have fought all my life since uh to to try to be a a live a life worthy of the gospel. And it just seems so impossible to meet it perfectly. To meet it perfectly. I get close and then I stumble and I get close and I stumble. But I mean I'm looking for a faith that's going to do the impossible. Amen. It literally produced in Abraham a mind beyond himself. You know the faith of Abraham can raise the dead. Did you know that? That's exactly if you go to the uh to the to the rich young ruler and he lifted up his head his eyes in hell. What a picture. I'd never thought about it till brother Jason pointed out the other night. Imagine imagine the agony of being able to see over into the paradise and you're in this torment and there's a he said I oh s he said there's a great gulf fixed between us and you can't come here and we can't come there. And he says well then send Lazarus back. So he had he had faith that Abraham could raise the dead. Yeah. Father Abraham, send him back. He's dead. But father but your father Abraham, you've got you've got the power of the spoken word. Oh, you [screaming] you've already you've met the king of Salem. Hallelujah. You already are familiar with speaking that which is impossible. See, so it's pretty good to be a child of Abraham. Amen. If you've got the same faith of Abraham, because it's a faith from somewhere beyond himself. And that's really the key. This is really the beauty of Mark 11 that Abraham didn't have to know how it would go, but but he could exercise uh his perfect faith and declare. And it turned out to be the voice of the Lord speaking through him in creation. You know what it did? It met his need. And and I want to say it this way. It met his need, the greatest need he would ever face. I mean, think of what he's on his way to do. Waited 24 25 years to get this son and then gets to half raise him only now to sacrifice him. You're talking about a need. You think you got a need? No. You ain't had a need like that. I'm here to tell you something, friends. You are just be glad and rejoice. I wouldn't have wanted to been Abraham facing that. Oh my. But it not only met his need. The word that catch it now. I want you to catch this. The the word that he spoke wasn't his own. That was God speaking through a vessel so surrendered that he was willing to take his child, his only child as far as God was concerned, and sacrificing. That's surrender. Amen. That's your model. That's your road map. That's the kind of sincerity that operates the third pull today. Don't don't misunderstand. You're not going to just sit in a message church and say, "I believe God sent a prophet." And, "Well, the devil does, too." "Well, I believe it's true." Well, so does the devil. Oh, I I believe in God. So does the devil. I believe the Bible. So does the devil. You understand? But but but but we don't find Satan operating creative power. We find God's family doing that. And what was and what was it? Because of the sincerity and the dedication and the total surrender and the total commitment, Abraham was fully committed. So the word that he spoke not only met the need that he had, but it also met the need of the word to manifest. See, because the word has a need. I mean the whole reason we have creation is because God wanted to express himself alone with his thoughts was not tenable. He didn't want to be that. He had been that in the eternities. So he creates angels and they start to worship him and now he becomes an object of worship. And then he he he he he starts creating heavens and earth. He and he's all doing all of that in the office of sunship. And he's he's he's moved himself into the pillar of fire. And now he's creating. And now he's got a earth. And now he's dressed it, made a garden, and put his son and his son's wife there. And now he's got future plans of a of a family and a whole economy and and a whole civilization, a universal [screaming] universewide civilization. I'm here to tell you, the universe we live in is a is a little pepper speck compared to his plans. [screaming] Yeah. Oh my. No wonder Paul could say, "You've never imagined what it's going to be. It's too much. Do you imagine? You don't have the You'll blow fuses. You don't have the wiring for it." But the word had a need to manifest. Why does God meet you here in church and you've taken the time to get up and get dressed and burn gas and dress your family and go through the vexations of all of that and get them to church and come into a building of your own vition and sit down and give some money and clap and sing for God to send a [screaming] crazy man out here and tell you you need to repent. And you need to have more sincerity. Who thought up this model? No wonder it's called the foolishness of preaching. But why do you keep coming back? You love pain. No, you [screaming] love the word. Why do you put up with it? Why do you ha why are you willing to take it and and not only take it but to say me more, [screaming] more, Lord, more? Help me, oh God. Why? Because there's been a supernatural power. You have not come to Sinai under a denomination. You have [screaming] come to Mount Zion. Hallelujah. You're part of the kingdom that's being developed in the world. You're being trained for rulership in the in the worlds to come. This is what the gospel is all about. See, so how will I operate the third pull? You just know this. God's word needs to manifest in this dark age. I'm here to tell you, he has designated it to speak through you. God doesn't need the whole world. He's looking for a few good men and women who are willing to surrender their life and meet his need. How many are there in this building today who say, "I would love to think that I could meet his need. I'm always asking him about my needs. He's always pouring so much on me. I'm so far behind. I'll never catch up. I can never repay. You're right. You can't. But yet, he has a need of you also. I want to say today, Lord, let my life meet your need. Let my life [screaming] be a living voice of this word. That's why you put it in a book. You didn't put it in a book to stay in a book. You when the when the book is closed for the last time, the [screaming] word will be flesh. You always intended to have it flesh. The word spoke about Jesus. It spoke of the coming Messiah. God was not satisfied with that. God put him in the earth and all the everything that was written became a human. Amen. And he's the beginning of a whole brand new creation. The church of the living God. This is what the gospel is about. This is what we believe. This is why we love the Lord. Hallelujah. It's more than just a theology. My goodness. Oh, I'd be so sad if that's all I had. If I didn't have a living reality of God in my life and I could feel him moving and I could see him moving and see him manifesting and see and feel and hear and touch and taste the power of the word of God in operation. Amen. He created this need in Abraham. Abraham needed to not lose his son. That's quite a need. Would you agree with me that that would be the greatest need he had ever had? You know, so so maybe it's not something God is planning to do in my life. You know, this this whole third pull, this whole spoken word, we've got these examples, you know, of fish and tumors. And I told you last time that that particular one there when he disappeared a tumor by a spoken word in an instant. I just said to me maybe other than the salvation of my sons the that that disappearing that that cancerous demon and a with a word disappeared it. And I just I remember saying to you here in part four, five or six somewhere back in there. I said I got things in my life that need disappeared. I got things that wasn't w wasn't supposed to be part of me that came as a result of sin or I was raised or this happened to me or that happened to me or this happened to you or that happened to you and it caused things in our life and maybe we were even culpable. Come on. Maybe we have to take some ownership in part of it. But I need a word that can disappear those things out of my life. Amen. And I don't know if it's something I don't think it's something that we plan to go around every day. You know, I do every day in my life, every waking hour as I walk these last miles of earth's history. But it's very comforting to know that it will be there when I face my greatest need. That's what it was for Abraham. It met his greatest need. Oh friends, you're almost certainly say, "What's my greatest need, Brother Jason?" Well, you're almost certainly never going to be able to figure that one out. You're almost certainly never going to be able to decipher your greatest need. But can I say to you today, "Shalom, bride, because it'll be the mind of Christ operating." You don't have to worry. [screaming] You got enough to worry about. Don't worry about that. It'll be the mind of Christ. worry about your sincerity and about your [screaming] dedication to the Lord. Because it will meet my greatest need. God knows what it is. Amen. So I just say today, I'm happy to just let him do the driving. Amen. You see, perfect faith in the third pull is distinct from human faith. And human faith's important. Even the right mental attitude towards every promise of God, any promise of God will bring it to pass. Amen. See, so we're not discounting human faith. You need human faith. You know, here's a prophet sitting trying to explain that to a young girl. And you know, he's he's looking at a at a fan and he's looking at a window shade and he says, "Watch." and he just stared at it and the shade rolled up and the shade rolled down and she said, "Brother Brandon, that's spiritualism." He started laughing. He said, "It's not spiritualism." He said, "It's just faith. There was a prophet who had learned how to operate that." And he looked, he just stares at it. He said, "Bring me a crosseyed child." He said this in front of the whole world with thousands of people. Yeah. You better be able to put up or shut up. And he said, "Just bring me any crosseyed child. I'll straighten her eyes out just by looking at them." Yeah. and he had done it. See, now he's he knew that that that's not the answer because that won't last. They asked him, "Do you have to be a Christian to get healed?" He said, "No, you don't have to be a Christian to get healed. The atonement is for whomsoever will." You don't have to be a Christian to get healed. But he said, "You you need to be a Christian if you want to stay healed." You come up under this anointing, the devil will take off. But as soon as you get outside and you're not a Christian and you haven't given your heart to the Lord, he'll just come right back and bring some buddies. Yeah. Amen. See where the the real church ain't playing church. This is life and death for many people. See, so [snorts] so we take it very seriously. But it's distinct from human faith. Perfect faith is a revelation of the word that is sovereignly given to you. It's it's a it's a moment where you face a situation and and and from a world other than the one you're walking around in, from a realm other than the one you live and breathe in, from some other supernatural realm, there comes an a revelation of God to strike your heart to believe that word. And the next thing you know, you can't even stop it. You're just saying it. I've had that happen. You're just saying it. It just happens in a moment. You're just at the right place. And here's a situation and here's a devil and I just like just like Shamgar. I'm a son of God. I'm a child of Abraham and they come in here every year and I don't have to put up with this. And he grabs an [screaming] ox goat and wipes them out an entire standing army. Let me tell you something, friends. This supernatural power is real. And I'm I'm I'm putting you on notice that this is the demonstration that God is determined to do at the end time. I know we've [screaming] seen God move already, but I'm here to tell you there's more to come. And if there wasn't, we had already [screaming] begun. Hallelujah. And I believe in a fresh surge. I believe in the dynamics of the Holy Ghost. Amen. Falling upon the word that we've received and believed. See, it's perfect faith. I mean, this is exactly why it can save your family. See, that's exactly why this this is so powerful. It can save your family when all hope is lost. When all human this isn't human faith. When all human hope is gone, there's still this there. God doesn't you think God is limited. Oh my. By this natural realm, you say, "Oh, well, you know, I know he's the God of good men. He's the God [screaming] of all men. He puts rings in the noses of emperors. Nobody's a match for him." Put your trust in Christ. Pull your token and say, "Devil, [screaming] I claim this child. God knew I would have them and God knew I'd [screaming] be a believer and he's going to have to make a way. Hallelujah. [screaming] That's the power of the third pole. And all it takes is dedicated lives. It's the mind of Christ in operation. It's not your mind. The lesson then is consecration and dedication. How dare I I remember saying this. I don't remember which s part I said it in, but I found in a note and I know it was part of this series. How dare any of us to how dare any of us allow our lives to be one foot in the word and one foot in the world. One foot in the word and one foot in Leodosa at this critical. First of all, let me just say, how dare you do that after all God has done for you and he needs you. He needs you. He needs He's looking to this bride to fulfill his word. And then as if that's not as if that's not enough, all that he's done for us and poured out his life, how can we not how could we live with one foot in Leodysia? Not only that, but think about everything you need. As that's why brother Brandon said in perfect faith, listen, he said you're going to need it. There's a day coming. You're going to need it. Guess what? [screaming] You're here. This is that day. You've reached an impossible age. It wasn't impossible in [screaming] his day. It hadn't gone into complete darkness. But looking forward, he didn't even think we'd make it out of the 20th century cuz it was just too impossible, [screaming] too dark. And yet, here we are. I say we must be believers. Hallelujah. [snorts] See, so only sincerity and much prayer and consecrated hearts will insulate God's family from wrong outcomes. Not saying you won't get trials and tribulations, but ultimately God will make it for your good because that's his promise. Amen. Bible doesn't say all things will be good. People say, 'Oh, well, you know, the Lord the Lord said all things are good to them that love him. That's not what it says. It says all things will work together for your good. They'll work together for your good. You see, when we think about Elijah, and we we uh we we read this last time, and you've got a PowerPoint, Bubba, but just hold up. Well, you can go ahead and put the title screen up, Noah. Um, and we'll [clears throat] just if I get to it, I'll get to it. We we found out, and I I mentioned this briefly because I didn't want to go into it deeply at the time, and uh and it's and especially in a series like this. I have a brother who's a great friend who literally creates a transcript of every sermon I preach and I don't publish them by any means. what he does with them is his business. But but and I do get emails from around the world. I'm not behind that for you looking at let me look in the camera. I'm that's not me doing that. That's that's other people. But it's fine. I don't he's a great friend. But uh it's particularly helpful in a series like this because I don't always remember, okay, did I cover that? What did I say? And then I jumped ahead and then I went back here. And so I can index the whole text and say, oh, did I ever say that? Oh, yeah. Right there it is. And you you got saved today about 20 minutes of material. Well, you don't have to listen to because you've already heard it to brother coffee. I you're brother Mark. They're thanking you today. Amen. But but here so here's one thing I do remember talking about briefly and I went back to look at the transcript to see just how far I went into it. But I want to say this if some of it is a recap. I want it I want you to get it because to me it was a big point that for Elijah we've read about Elijah and Elisha and how that they crossed the Jordan went to the other side and Elijah was taken up in a as we would call it a rapture in a in a in a chariot of fire as a type of the rapture and then and then the mantle fell upon Elisha and you remember we've talked about how their names were so similar Elijah Elisha probably said like Mr. Jesus like Mrs. Jesus. See, it's Christ and his family. The kingdoms of this world have have become the kingdoms of our Lord and his Christ. That's the anointed. That's his family. See, you're not Jesus Christ. He's Jesus Christ. But but but she's Mrs. Jesus Christ. Just like it's all it is is Adam and Eve again restored back like in the Garden of Eden. That's the real mystery that unlocks the Godhead. If people would just not get tripped up on father son, they wouldn't see him as multiple people. It's a husband and a wife. That's that's the secret of the kingdom. See, so so so we realize that it is father son in those offices. I'm not saying it's not. I'm just saying you're better to think of the godhead as husband wife. You you won't get twisted around. So So we find that that Elijah they cross and then he says, "I need a double portion. What do you want for me? I need a double portion." And he was going to need it. he was going to. Now that has two that has a a dual meaning in the in the Old Testament and this is borne out in many common commentators but you also can bear it out in the original Hebrew. uh but we find that it has a a double double meaning that it it first of all it means in fact is from theologians if I just take if we didn't have a prophet we wouldn't even know the other half of it which is actually a greater half from theologians it just means that he's copied and pasted it's just a d he's just duplicated so whatever you are I want to be but a prophet in this day comes and goes back and peels off a few more layers theologians couldn't get to and he says, "No, it's actually a double like you think of a double portion because in this day we've got the double threat of the days of Noah and the days of Lot. You've got an age of Satan's Eden. That's unprecedented. You've got Satan as the god of this evil age. That's unprecedented. Hallelujah. You've got men's hearts failing for fear. You've got perilous times. You've got men running after seducing spirits. You've got teachers with itching ears. Those are all end prophecies. It wasn't that they didn't have some of that in in play all down through the ages, but you've got the whole tsunami. You've got the entire thing o overflowing you. And but I'm here to tell you when Satan comes in like a flood, [screaming] God raised us a standard. Hallelujah. And we we have a double portion. See, but of course you know that that when when brother Brandham has his experience there in the vision with the great Mamba and he said, "I I saw in this and what God was showing him, he saw himself walking on a map of Palestine." And he looked and he could see the Jordan River coming. And now the he's coming to the third pole. And this is the time of the the the third phase of his ministry, the last one. The one that's going to come on the bride, the one that's going to go on to Moses and Elijah. Same one, same Holy Ghost. See, people who say we don't need the Holy Ghost anymore. That's what Moses and Elijah getting. Good grief. How are you going to get a new birth? How how's the 144,000 going to get born again if they don't have the Holy Ghost? So, so people can just get so twisted. It's it's it's nonsense sometimes. They don't they don't know their Bibles is what they don't know. Yeah. And [snorts] so so we find that that when when it when it when it comes to that time and there's that great mamba snake and brother knew what it was having been on safari many times and it was very large and he said all the people men's hearts failing for fear. Everybody was afraid. It was a time of great fear. Everybody was afraid and there was somebody with him, a brother. And here come this great serpent. He said, "I could hear it crashing through crashing through the weeds and it came out onto the road and everybody's scattering." And he said, "And here it comes." And he said, "It comes right at me." And and and he said, "As as it began to get to me, it tried to reach tried to reach and it got stopped and it couldn't quite bite me." And he says, "You've been given power over him." Amen. to bind him and he bound him. I bind you in the name of Jesus. And you know the story. And he said, "You've been given power to loose him." And he said, "I loose you in the name of Jesus." And he started coming life. And he bound him back really quick. See? And so he he's got all of this all of this is happening because the Jordan is now in coming. It's the third phase. And he says, "Now this mamba, this sphere, these people that are following you, here's a brother following you. There's the Jordan. It's all working together. And what does it mean? What does Jordan mean? Death to self. Because what what what is he's saying now? You're going to have to be more sincere than you've ever been. He was asking for the impossible. And brother Brandham couldn't be more sincere and had no idea how to become more sincere. So you know what he said? Very well, Lord. Amen. Amen. I can't do it, but you said it very well. Then make me more sincere. That's quite a prayer because you don't know what you might be praying for. But I I just say today with all the courage and all the human courage I can get, anybody that wants to volunteer to come along, I want to say very well, Lord, then make me more. Make me more sincere than I've ever been in my life. Oh, I see all of you don't have that courage. You got that courage [screaming] today to say, "Lord, whatever it takes, by whatever means necessary." Yeah, there's some more honest hands, make me more sincere. Amen. Amen. See, because because remember because look the he's coming to this Jordan, death to self. We read about Elijah's rapture. Elijah would have never got to the rapture had he not crossed the Jordan. The rapture was on the other side of crossing. The rapture was a fresh death to self. Elijah was already a great man of God. But when it came time for the rapture, Elijah had to have a fresh crossing. Elisha received a promise, a double anointing. His mantle fell upon him. But when Elisha got back to the river, he also needed to cross Jordan. He had to have a fresh. He had followed the prophet. He had been loyal. He had been faithful. He went to church. He paid his ti. He sung songs. He He told everybody. He washed the hands of the prophet. But he needed a fresh a fresh anointing. Hallelujah. He had a secondhanded robe, but prophet said he needed a firsthand experience. If he was going to operate the third pole, if he was going to operate [screaming] the double portion, he would have to cross Jordan as well. Come on, friends. Where did John begin his ministry? At the Jordan. Where did Jesus begin his ministry at the Jordan? Where did a prophet come to the [screaming] Jordan? He said, "How vital is it? That mamba is here." And he said, "When it couldn't get to me, it went after my brother." That's you. And he said, "I was watching my brother and he was jumping up in the air, jumping and leaping, escaping, and the serpent trying to strike him. And brother Prideam is crying for mercy because here's why. Here's why. Here's why." He said, "I knew one hit and it's over. One hit and it's over. [screaming] Moms, dads, parents, preachers, one hit on your children and it could be over. [screaming] One hit on your You need the third pull. You need Jordan. You need a fresh anointing. That's how that's [screaming] how vital it is. That's how perilous the times that we live in are. You don't have time to have carnality in your home. Not if you love your family, fathers, dads. Come on. If you love that woman, if you love that child, have a token [laughter] applied to that home. Amen. Hallelujah. One hit is all it took. Elisha comes back down to the river and he can't open it because he he realizes, "Yeah, I' I've followed this ministry, but now it's got to become now that messenger's gone, and I can't just push play anymore." Amen. Amen. I'll go the rest of my life pushing play, but I can't just do that. Amen. I got to have Where's the God? Where's the God? I I followed a man who followed a god. Where's the god for me? What god? Baal? No. A star tank? No. Uh which which heathen god? None of them. Which god? The god [screaming] of Elijah. I want the god of Elijah. Where's the god of Elijah? [screaming] That's the god. I'm not here for the god of this evil age. I'm not here for leodysia. I want the God of Elijah. Hallelujah. And that opened the Jordan. And that crossed him through a fresh death to self. That activated [screaming] that activated his power over the snake. That activated his power over that serpent. That activated his double portion. Amen. Amen. Death to self is the only path to operating the double portion. That is what [sighs] that is what so many have lacked. They've tried to do an end round on that. See, but we find that you you can't do that. It you're if you're going to operate that ministry, it's [snorts] got to start at Jordan. You're no better than John the Baptist. You're no better than Jesus. It's where they had to start. See Jordan Jordan Jordan was in the path of of of the much needed sincerity. You get that? Jordan was in the path of that. The sincerity that he needed was on the other side of it. And for Elisha, the sincerity and the double portion he needed was back on the other side again. See, so no matter how you no matter how you go, you're not going to be able to get around it. a greater level of sincerity that is needed for this hour. And you know, brother Brandham, you know, he comes to the end of describing He comes to the end of describing Boy, I'm out of time. He comes to the end of describing his experience in the woods operating the supernatural part of his this this third pull, this supernatural part of his 33-year ministry. And that's where he begins to cry out for fresh revival. That's what it meant to him. That if I'm if I'm going to accomplish what's needed for this hour, I'm going to have to have a death to self. Remember, this is this is exactly what I believe the prophet is speaking of when he calls it a fresh surge. This is what the prophet is saying when we've operated in a small way, but you just watch when this begins to tighten up. Watch it then. See, and it'll be to the to the totally lost, to the church, and to the bride. And they all three have a different application. But this is the one where he said that I am looking for the the dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the Holy Ghost that we've operated in small way. I'm here to tell you something, friends. We're we're 60 years in. And you know that Paul's alpha age only had 20 years before they started to backslide. So they never made it to the body change. We've had 60 years to get back in step and get the word restored and get it all around the world and find it in the darkest jungles. And now we've got a global bride ready around the world. But the requirement remains the same. Don't leave here today thinking that this is, you know, to me, I I I don't believe that that it that it should be that I need the catalyst of the dead saints rising to somehow quicken my faith. I I I you know, God can do whatever he wants to do. And I guess the point I'm trying to make is that I don't want to think that I need some kind of cosmic jump start, right? I'd like to believe that I'm right there. I'd like to believe it's just a short little step and that when they appear in my living room, it won't it won't be that much of a surprise. Oh, hallelujah. because because it's very clear and I'm not going to go through the quotes today, but a prophet went quote after quote after quote after quote that there will be this bride who will call forth the sleeping saints. It'll be this bride and her life and her faith that'll literally raise the dead and call them back. Oh my. Oh. Oh, I don't know. I say, "How's that going to work?" I don't know. But it would thrill me if one of these mornings I step out into my living room and I feel a strange feeling and I don't know. It's going all over the [screaming] world. And something begins to well up within me. And I hear myself saying, "Brother Eddie, come forth." Hallelujah. Sister Seal, come forth. Brother Jesse, Sister Bonnie, come [screaming] forth. Hallelujah. You say, "Well, it happened that way. I don't know, but I know I'm going to be there. I know I'm going to be involved in it." Hallelujah. That's what happened to Jesus at the tomb of Lazarus. Lazarus, specifically you, [screaming] not everybody. [laughter] Come forth. Oh, my friends. This is the day the Lord has made. I will be glad and rejoice in it. Hallelujah. Oh, let's stand to our feet. Brother Anthony, bring your team. Hallelujah. I want to sing that song. Brother Andrew, this is the day the Lord has made.
