[2:31] god bless you
[2:32] let's stand and pray
[2:37] heavenly father we come before you in
[2:39] the name of jesus christ and we're
[2:41] asking for your mercy and grace upon us
[2:43] lord
[2:44] fill us with your spirit lord in your
[2:46] love and your light lord let your word
[2:49] flow through each one of us
[2:51] may you your name be lifted up and
[2:53] glorified this morning take your word
[2:55] and break it open to our hearts we ask
[2:57] in jesus name
[2:58] amen i'm going to continue
[3:01] looking at the two seeds of genesis
[3:04] chapter three
[3:06] and
[3:07] scripture we're going to read is
[3:10] genesis 3 14 and 15. if you want to
[3:13] bring that up
[3:14] all right
[3:16] and the lord god said unto the serpent
[3:18] because you have done this you're cursed
[3:20] above all cattle and above every beast
[3:23] of the field upon thy belly shalt thou
[3:26] go
[3:26] and dust shalt thou eat all the days of
[3:29] thy life
[3:30] and i will put enmity between thee and
[3:33] the woman
[3:34] and between thy seed or thy offspring
[3:37] and her offspring
[3:38] it shall bruise thy head
[3:41] and thou shalt bruise his heel
[3:43] may the lord add the blessing to the
[3:45] reading of his word you can be seated
[3:50] so
[3:52] this verse is
[3:55] the
[3:55] at the end of 15 is actually
[3:58] the first prophecy of the messiah
[4:02] it's ultimately speaking of
[4:05] what christ did at calvary
[4:08] against the devil
[4:10] but isn't it interesting that the
[4:11] terminology that is used is
[4:14] you know
[4:15] offspring
[4:17] between
[4:18] your offspring so
[4:20] it's almost as saying as though the
[4:22] devil
[4:23] is the offspring of the serpent which of
[4:26] course we understand
[4:27] that's that's not accurate but
[4:30] if you take this
[4:31] if you take this
[4:33] back you run it all the way through
[4:34] scripture genesis to revelation
[4:37] it becomes simple to understand it's the
[4:39] offspring of the devil
[4:42] coming through the serpent seed line
[4:46] both of them both seeds both of these
[4:48] offspring
[4:49] come through eve but one is reckoned to
[4:52] be eve's proper
[4:54] offspring of course via adam but the
[4:57] other one is referred to as the
[4:59] serpent's seed that's where we get that
[5:02] title for that doctrine the serpent seed
[5:05] right from this scripture
[5:07] it's it's a direct biblical reference
[5:10] between thy seed who's thy he's speaking
[5:13] to the serpent
[5:14] so it's the serpent's seed
[5:17] and so the last two times we've spent
[5:19] spent time
[5:21] going through the scriptures genesis to
[5:23] revelation
[5:24] i want to just summarize that
[5:27] and move on to the very last thing
[5:29] because what typically happens
[5:31] has happened for me
[5:33] in sharing serpent seed with someone
[5:36] who's never heard it before
[5:38] is you go through all of this you speak
[5:41] all of this they're amazed and shocked
[5:43] and at the end they say
[5:45] but genesis 4 verse 1 completely blows
[5:48] your
[5:49] understanding out of the water
[5:51] it directly set tells us that
[5:54] cain is the son
[5:56] is the result
[5:57] of adam and eve
[5:59] over and over and over and over and over
[6:00] again you spend your time going through
[6:03] the whole scriptures and then it gets to
[6:05] the end or maybe they leave and they
[6:07] come do some research and then they come
[6:08] back to you and say but genesis 4 1. i
[6:11] mean
[6:12] how can you believe in that
[6:14] how can you understand that
[6:17] that's the that's what we're going to
[6:18] spend most of our time
[6:20] talking about and answering
[6:22] this morning
[6:24] so next slide
[6:26] so first it's god's command
[6:29] comes to the adam and eve
[6:31] even when they're still in spirit form
[6:34] as as a promise as a potentiality it's
[6:37] to multiply
[6:38] and replenish the earth
[6:41] that's god's first commandment along
[6:44] with taking dominion over it then come
[6:48] then in genesis 2 8 and 9 god commands
[6:51] them not to eat
[6:52] of the tree of knowledge
[6:54] which is in the midst of the garden
[6:57] and so we took time and showed
[7:00] that these are two figurative trees not
[7:02] literal trees revelation 2 7
[7:05] shows us that
[7:06] then we look and we found in song of
[7:09] solomon
[7:10] uh chapter 4 verse 12 and 16 as well as
[7:13] in
[7:14] chapter 5 verse one
[7:15] uh the garden that these two trees are
[7:18] that the tree is in the midst of
[7:20] is the body of eve
[7:21] you can find
[7:23] and search through the message and see
[7:25] different quotes where brother branham
[7:26] points at different aspects of this
[7:28] sometimes it's the body of eve sometimes
[7:31] it's the devil himself if we understand
[7:34] the life source behind the two trees
[7:37] is the lord jesus christ
[7:39] and satan
[7:40] but they're not literally the lord jesus
[7:43] christ and satan
[7:45] they're two they're two things that are
[7:47] governing life
[7:50] in fact you can speak of it figuratively
[7:52] all through scripture
[7:54] to to eat of the tree of life today
[7:57] is to receive the message for your day
[8:00] that's eating of the tree of life
[8:02] eating of the tree of knowledge of good
[8:03] and evil it's
[8:04] eating a bit a little bit of the the
[8:06] word and a little bit of the false word
[8:09] from the false vine
[8:11] this is that that's what that's how you
[8:12] do it today but that's the law governing
[8:16] the the laws governing the reproduction
[8:20] of life
[8:22] god says if you eat of the tree of not
[8:24] tree of life you'll produce children
[8:26] with eternal life if you eat of the tree
[8:29] of the knowledge and good and evil it
[8:30] will produce death
[8:33] all right
[8:35] also we saw over and over again that
[8:38] the
[8:41] the garden was referred to as
[8:44] solomon's wife
[8:47] that was her her body speaking of that
[8:50] as a garden of course we understand
[8:52] there's a literal garden of eden
[8:55] but there's also trees in them there's
[8:57] trees that grow out of the ground
[8:59] and then there's trees that grow out of
[9:01] the midst of the garden
[9:03] all right
[9:05] so next slide
[9:08] proverbs 30 verse 20 shows that they
[9:11] shows what eating means eating is used
[9:13] as a figure
[9:15] of the sexual act it's also used in
[9:18] song of solomon chapter 4 5 and 6.
[9:22] and it's that's that was literally
[9:24] spoken of as
[9:26] this is the way of the adulterous woman
[9:29] she eats and wipes her mouth and says
[9:30] i've done no wrong
[9:33] genesis 3 15 god puts that enmity
[9:35] between
[9:36] two genetic lines
[9:40] it's not it's not merely a prophecy of
[9:42] the messiah and the devil but it's two
[9:44] genetic lines and the ultimate of the
[9:47] two genetic lines is jesus christ
[9:50] on one side
[9:52] and
[9:52] judas on the other side you see that
[9:55] brother branham talks about that but
[9:56] then it continues on even after that
[9:59] in the scripture
[10:02] all right
[10:04] jesus and the pharisees both refer to
[10:07] the original sin in john chapter 8 as
[10:10] fornication
[10:12] next screen
[10:14] paul refers to the original sin as
[10:15] adultery in second corinthians 11
[10:18] and john
[10:19] references cain
[10:21] as being the son of the wicked one
[10:23] in first john
[10:25] 3 verse 12.
[10:28] so
[10:30] we go through all this
[10:33] i remember especially when i was
[10:35] uh going to bethel college
[10:38] as a baptist school and a lot of
[10:40] wonderful sincere
[10:42] believers there
[10:43] but when it would come to this doctrine
[10:45] you'd go through all of these things and
[10:47] they just sit there with their mouth on
[10:49] the floor just shocked
[10:51] to see it and then
[10:53] you say well just pray about it and
[10:55] we'll follow up again and talk
[10:57] in a couple weeks you come back
[10:59] and the
[11:00] the scripture they bring is on from on
[11:02] the next screen genesis 4 verse 1.
[11:05] and they take this and they say see
[11:07] here's here's a bomb that blows up
[11:09] everything you said i see the validity
[11:11] of what you said
[11:12] but
[11:14] here's the scripture
[11:17] you're done
[11:19] adam knew his wife
[11:20] and she conceived and bear cain and said
[11:23] i've gotten a man from the lord the
[11:25] first time someone said that to me i was
[11:27] like
[11:28] i have no idea
[11:32] my first response was you can't take
[11:35] you can't take one scripture and make it
[11:37] blow up the rest of scripture
[11:39] true statement
[11:41] but i think there's there's something
[11:42] even in even more important there
[11:45] if you click the mouse again i guess
[11:47] it'll bring up the next one yeah
[11:49] so in
[11:51] here's a little
[11:52] lesson in english
[11:54] we have past present and future tense
[11:58] but in hebrew they don't have that they
[12:00] just have two tenses perfect
[12:02] and imperfect
[12:03] perfect tense
[12:05] is a completed action
[12:08] imperfect tense is an action
[12:10] that's in process
[12:12] all right
[12:14] so let's look at the next screen
[12:20] and adam had known
[12:23] his wife
[12:24] and she was conceiving
[12:27] and she was bearing cane
[12:30] so when you look at this the tenses of
[12:33] that word it looks like
[12:34] it's all the same
[12:36] but in in hebrew
[12:40] they don't have
[12:42] uh punctuation
[12:44] there's no punctuation there's no period
[12:45] there's no exclamation point
[12:47] there's no commas there's no colons look
[12:50] look in your bible go back to the last
[12:52] screen
[12:55] look in that verse
[12:58] we have a semicolon
[13:00] commas
[13:01] and a period
[13:03] how did they do that when there's none
[13:05] of that
[13:07] in the hebrew
[13:08] well
[13:10] what their support what a translator is
[13:12] supposed to do is supposed to take the
[13:13] thought
[13:14] and the tenses of the verbs
[13:18] and
[13:19] make their sentences
[13:20] so here
[13:22] in this one they make it all
[13:24] one sentence
[13:26] i think they're trying to use the
[13:27] semicolon to to give some distinction
[13:31] if you look at a french translation
[13:34] i think french has a similar
[13:37] setup
[13:38] with verb tenses
[13:40] if you look at a french translation it
[13:42] has this as the first sentence and adam
[13:44] knew his wife period
[13:45] so end of thought
[13:47] moving to the next thought
[13:49] and she was conceiving so if you can go
[13:51] back to the last screen
[13:53] the next screen
[13:56] she was conceiving and she was bearing
[13:58] cane in other words
[14:00] adam had known that that's a perfect
[14:03] tense it's a completed action
[14:06] in other words this is
[14:08] like saying
[14:11] back
[14:12] back a little while ago
[14:13] adam had known his wife that's done
[14:17] and she was conceiving and she was
[14:20] bearing cain
[14:21] so the purpose of that those tenses
[14:24] is to show a distinction between the
[14:26] actions verbs are an action word
[14:29] so it's trying to show different actions
[14:31] there you say
[14:32] was that how they do it every time are
[14:35] you from you're familiar that the
[14:37] scripture
[14:38] brings this
[14:39] same phraseology multiple different
[14:42] times if you go to the next screen
[14:46] so we see here again and cain knew his
[14:49] wife and she conceived and bear enoch
[14:51] and he builded a city and called the
[14:53] name of the city after the name of his
[14:55] son
[14:57] enoch okay
[15:00] genesis 4 25.
[15:03] so
[15:04] we'll go back to that and adam knew his
[15:06] wife again and she bear a son and called
[15:09] his name seth for god said she
[15:11] had appointed me another seed instead of
[15:14] abel whom cain slew
[15:16] so let's go back
[15:19] yes right there
[15:21] hear the tenses of that verse cain was
[15:24] knowing his wife so it's all imperfect
[15:26] tense
[15:27] it's all action in process cain was
[15:29] knowing his wife and she was conceiving
[15:31] and was bearing enoch
[15:34] so again it's the same
[15:36] verb tense for each and every one of
[15:39] those words
[15:41] and then go to the next screen one more
[15:46] there you go
[15:47] same thing adam was knowing his wife
[15:50] again and she was
[15:52] burying a son etc
[15:54] so
[15:55] once again same verb tenses in this
[15:59] it's it's it's the same it's this it's
[16:01] actions
[16:03] multiple actions that are all connected
[16:05] together with the same tents
[16:09] so
[16:10] next screen
[16:14] and adam knew his wife and she conceived
[16:16] and bear cane and said i've gotten a man
[16:19] from the lord so you understand these
[16:22] are separate actions
[16:25] three different examples of verses looks
[16:27] exactly the same right
[16:29] should be should be similar
[16:32] what is happening here adam had known
[16:35] his wife period that's the thought
[16:38] and she was conceiving and she was
[16:39] bearing cane so
[16:44] does this itself in itself teach
[16:48] serpenceed
[16:50] no
[16:51] not by itself
[16:54] definitely not by itself but
[16:56] it should
[16:57] lead a person to go what's happening
[16:59] here because
[17:01] these other verses
[17:03] are different than this one why
[17:06] would this be different
[17:08] than those other verses
[17:09] because whoever's writing genesis god
[17:13] through through moses
[17:15] is trying to point out a distinction
[17:18] in the actions why would he write it
[17:21] this way
[17:24] why would he write it that way what
[17:25] what's what was the point of writing it
[17:27] that way
[17:29] just like the rest of genesis chapter 2
[17:33] genesis chapter 3
[17:35] it is hiding the truth in plain sight
[17:41] now
[17:42] in our english language it hit it even
[17:44] more
[17:46] it's incredible
[17:48] but if you dig a little deeper you could
[17:50] see
[17:51] exactly what this these verses are
[17:53] speaking about
[17:55] and this is this is important and i
[17:57] think i think
[17:58] everyone should remember this if you're
[18:00] sharing serpent seed with someone
[18:01] eventually
[18:03] if if they're astute enough they're
[18:04] going to come to this point
[18:06] where they say
[18:08] i'm dropping a bomb on you now
[18:11] but now you can answer
[18:12] no it's look at these other verses why
[18:15] is it why is it different
[18:17] no this verse doesn't prove serpent seed
[18:19] absolutely not
[18:20] but it doesn't disprove serpent seed
[18:23] absolutely does not it separates those
[18:26] two thoughts
[18:27] it makes them distinct
[18:29] and and that's
[18:31] that's that's key and that's critical i
[18:33] i i myself learned this
[18:36] um
[18:38] from the brothers in in
[18:41] turkey
[18:42] the iranian brothers
[18:45] the reason they discovered it was
[18:48] two of them speak the french language
[18:51] they saw it
[18:52] in
[18:54] their french bible saw this difference
[18:56] looked to the english and the persian
[18:57] bible didn't see that
[19:00] there
[19:01] so they began to study and and as i
[19:03] studied myself i found lots of different
[19:05] references
[19:06] to this specific thing
[19:08] and so praise the lord god
[19:11] hides his truth
[19:13] in
[19:14] in simplicity
[19:15] you know again
[19:18] we go back go back to
[19:21] screen
[19:22] number three
[19:27] you know looking at
[19:29] looking at all of these evidences
[19:33] why would god come he commands them
[19:34] multiply and replenish the earth let's
[19:36] skip the trees all right
[19:39] let's skip that portion and say all
[19:41] right
[19:42] i don't understand what this means it's
[19:44] very strange
[19:45] eating fruit and so forth is going to
[19:47] cause us to die
[19:49] i i don't i don't get that okay let me
[19:52] leave that aside i'll come back to
[19:54] understand that later
[19:55] then we go forward and we see
[19:59] the the serpent speaking to eve
[20:02] okay
[20:03] and again speaking about eating the
[20:06] fruit is pleasant to the eyes and a tree
[20:08] desire to make one
[20:10] wise all these different things all
[20:12] right you can grab that and just say if
[20:15] the bible is literal
[20:17] we cannot we cannot go and understand
[20:20] things this way okay all right we we
[20:23] have that but then immediately when god
[20:26] is putting let's let's uh if you want to
[20:28] bring up the scripture
[20:30] there in i think it's the first second
[20:32] screen
[20:35] god comes to the curses
[20:39] what is he doing
[20:40] look at the serpent he's he's literally
[20:43] changing
[20:44] his dna
[20:47] he's taking away his ability
[20:50] what was his abilities
[20:52] well
[20:53] he was able to speak this is not talking
[20:55] about the devil
[20:59] get that out of your mind people people
[21:00] think that the serpent is the devil you
[21:02] see all the
[21:03] it drives me crazy seeing the little
[21:05] children's book you know you're
[21:07] you're reading something to your
[21:09] children and they got the snake oh i
[21:11] seen one that the snake was a big giant
[21:13] lizard that was just recently
[21:17] goodness what
[21:19] a giant lizard that could talk
[21:22] no
[21:25] he stood on all he stood on stood on two
[21:27] feet
[21:28] he could he could speak
[21:30] he could reason so what is god doing
[21:32] here he's changing his dna so he
[21:34] couldn't do
[21:36] what he did before
[21:38] totally changing his dna structure all
[21:40] right
[21:42] then
[21:43] the in the next breath
[21:45] he says
[21:46] i'll be
[21:47] put enmity between thee and the woman
[21:50] okay well didn't he didn't he already do
[21:52] that by making him a snake
[21:54] there would
[21:55] in other words there's no affinity
[21:57] between the woman
[21:59] and the serpent anymore
[22:01] so god placing that enmity there that's
[22:03] finished but then it goes further
[22:05] between thy seed and her seed
[22:08] this verse right here should put stop us
[22:11] in our tracks
[22:13] because if that is a prophecy of the
[22:15] messiah which every christian
[22:18] catholic
[22:19] orthodox
[22:20] evangelical
[22:23] everyone who believes it
[22:25] everyone believes that
[22:26] so if her seed is the lord jesus christ
[22:31] that crushes the head
[22:34] of who
[22:36] the devil
[22:39] it's offspring so if you're going to say
[22:41] the serpent is the devil which many
[22:43] denominational people believe
[22:45] the serpent is the devil
[22:48] who is the devil's offspring
[22:51] it has to be answered
[22:53] because here it's speaking about
[22:55] offspring all right it's just spiritual
[22:58] it's just spiritual offspring
[23:01] well
[23:02] okay
[23:04] flip uh flip over to scripture josh and
[23:06] give me
[23:07] genesis 3 16.
[23:22] this is the curse
[23:25] god is placing on the woman as a result
[23:27] of her sin
[23:29] i will greatly multiply thy sorrow and
[23:31] thy conception in sorrow thou shalt
[23:34] bring forth children just the verse
[23:36] before he's talking about children
[23:38] right
[23:41] so thy seed thy seed
[23:44] and the serpent seed
[23:47] but
[23:48] no she ate from
[23:50] a tree
[23:52] she ate fruit
[23:54] so if she ate fruit
[23:56] the bible says an eye for an eye and a
[23:59] tooth for a tooth
[24:01] i will give you a toothache and stomach
[24:03] ache shall you have
[24:06] but here god is saying
[24:09] the part of your body that you sinned
[24:11] with
[24:12] i'm punishing
[24:16] this verse in itself should make
[24:18] everyone go
[24:19] what's happening here
[24:23] two two verses okay god said don't god
[24:26] said multiply and replenish the earth
[24:28] then he said don't eat of these two
[24:30] trees in the midst of the garden one
[24:32] brings life one brings death
[24:34] all right
[24:35] or he didn't say don't eat of two trees
[24:38] he said don't eat of the tree of the
[24:40] knowledge of good and evil that brings
[24:42] death
[24:43] the tree of life
[24:45] produces life of course
[24:47] then we see two seeds two seed lines
[24:52] spoken of
[24:53] the genetic structure of the serpent
[24:55] changed and here god says i'm gonna
[24:58] multiply your sorrow and pain in
[25:00] conception in sorrow you'll bring forth
[25:03] children
[25:04] and your desire shall be to your husband
[25:06] and he shall rule over you so we have
[25:11] genetics changing
[25:13] two seed lines
[25:15] enmity there
[25:17] a prophecy of the messiah
[25:20] pain and pain and sorrow being
[25:22] multiplied in conception
[25:25] and a desire towards her husband and him
[25:27] ruling over here it's so if if that's
[25:30] god's punishment
[25:31] and god is just an eye for an eye and a
[25:33] tooth for a tooth
[25:35] then what was the sin
[25:38] eating of a tree
[25:41] just ask yourself could it be figurative
[25:44] could it possibly be figurative
[25:47] of course we understand it is it's
[25:48] simple
[25:50] it's simple genesis 4 1 does not
[25:52] disprove serpent seed it demonstrates
[25:56] the truth of serpent seed that the act
[25:58] of adam is separate and distinct
[26:01] from the life that was produced
[26:03] in cain
[26:05] so obviously we understand there was
[26:07] twins involved
[26:09] the act happened very close
[26:11] same day
[26:12] that produced cain and abel born as
[26:15] twins
[26:16] so we're just going to close it right
[26:18] there if you want to stand let's pray
[26:23] heavenly father we're so thankful for
[26:25] your word
[26:27] we're so thankful for the light
[26:29] that you've shined upon it in this day

[26:46] as the scripture says it's given unto

[26:55] and ears to hear
