[31:53] amen we're just happy to be here tonight
[31:55] um
[31:57] i i missed last wednesday when they were
[31:59] all given testimonies but i was but i
[32:01] was watching in
[32:03] those of you who were at camp we all had
[32:04] such a good time of fellowship and
[32:06] hearing the word
[32:08] our spirits get to listen to all that
[32:10] worship
[32:11] you know there's
[32:12] five six services and all that great
[32:14] worship and all that all those great
[32:16] services back to back
[32:18] then when we come we come home we find
[32:19] ourselves wishing to be back at camp
[32:21] amen
[32:22] uh
[32:23] of course you know we were around
[32:24] friends but you know we were around
[32:26] other believers like-minded people and
[32:28] just gathered together
[32:30] one accord which is awesome
[32:32] one sole purpose and that was to draw
[32:34] closer closer to jesus and that's i
[32:36] think that was the purpose of all of it
[32:39] i want to speak to you tonight on being
[32:41] led to the spirit
[32:43] this message is really close to my heart
[32:46] because of how the lord has been dealing
[32:47] with me over the past few months and
[32:49] especially over the past couple of days
[32:52] brother jason texted me
[32:53] just a few days ago um he was and he
[32:56] asked me
[32:57] uh to take tonight
[32:58] and before before we went to camp before
[33:02] covett and everything happened i was
[33:03] actually scheduled to to to minister
[33:05] that night and i had a sermon on my
[33:07] heart and so when he texted me i i was
[33:10] thought to myself awesome i already have
[33:12] a sermon
[33:13] but uh the lord had other intentions for
[33:15] tonight
[33:17] something that the lord has been
[33:18] personally dealing with me
[33:20] is uh lately on this subject matter
[33:23] itself just being submissive to his
[33:25] leadership
[33:27] um
[33:29] you know as human beings and as
[33:30] christians
[33:32] i believe we all fall short of this you
[33:34] know from time to time
[33:35] but i'm learning that god doesn't want
[33:37] us just to give us a task or a message
[33:39] and then come back when when he has
[33:42] another message or a task for us he
[33:43] wants to be with us through the whole
[33:46] process
[33:47] the whole process he wants to be their
[33:48] friends and so i've been learning that
[33:50] and just been trying to give it to the
[33:51] lord and
[33:52] you know he wants to direct your path he
[33:54] wants you to be a part of he wants to
[33:56] not just be a part of the decision but
[33:58] he wants to be a part of the whole the
[33:59] whole decision-making process amen
[34:02] um we were when we were at the men's
[34:04] meeting a couple a couple of months ago
[34:06] i believe it was
[34:08] i believe it was brother sam browning
[34:10] made a statement and it just really
[34:12] spoke to me it says god never made us to
[34:14] be independent of him
[34:16] in fact the closer you get to god the
[34:19] more you realize
[34:21] just how dependent on him that you need
[34:23] to be amen and that just spoke to my
[34:25] heart because you know young people you
[34:27] know
[34:28] as you get older you have the desire to
[34:30] be more independent of your parents you
[34:32] know you want to get a license and you
[34:34] know you want to get a car and you want
[34:35] to be able to drive yourself around and
[34:37] you want to have a job so you can have
[34:38] your own money and those things are
[34:40] natural you know that's great um
[34:43] i remember feeling that way too
[34:45] but now i look back and i'm like
[34:47] uh it was so great to not worry about
[34:49] bills or a mortgage or going to work
[34:52] so i'm thankful for those times amen but
[34:55] even though it's natural for us to grow
[34:57] up and
[34:58] you know and gain responsibility get
[35:00] married and you know have a place to
[35:02] live and be independent of our parents
[35:03] here on earth
[35:05] it should never be like that with our
[35:06] heavenly father amen
[35:09] he's here to do what it says in psalms
[35:11] 140 and that's to teach us to do his
[35:14] will and lead us
[35:17] into the land of uprightness
[35:20] just a little um thank you just a little
[35:22] personal testimony i had just
[35:24] being led of the spirit
[35:26] a few months back i i had an opportunity
[35:29] to do this little
[35:30] this little part-time job and um
[35:33] i didn't i didn't pray about it i didn't
[35:35] i just i applied and i got hired and um
[35:38] it was going i was going through the
[35:39] process and one night i was laying in
[35:40] bed i was actually at work and
[35:43] you know they had already hired me but
[35:45] i was just laying in bed and the lord
[35:46] started to really check my heart he's
[35:48] you know where where do i need to use
[35:50] that yeah okay can i just give you this
[35:52] then yeah okay
[35:54] all right
[35:58] yeah
[35:59] amen got some technical difficulties
[36:01] that's all right though
[36:03] perfect
[36:04] old-fashioned amen
[36:05] um
[36:07] but i was just laying there that night
[36:08] and i was just praying and the lord
[36:10] really started dealing with me started
[36:11] checking my heart and just saying you
[36:12] know how how are you
[36:15] you know you you've got your family at
[36:16] home now you're going to have this
[36:17] newborn and you you know you're you're
[36:19] doing the school you're doing these
[36:20] things and now you want to get a
[36:22] part-time job you know you don't it's
[36:23] not something that you need to do lord
[36:25] he was just really checking my heart
[36:26] he's like you didn't even ask me about
[36:28] this you didn't you didn't pray about it
[36:29] you didn't lay it before me you didn't
[36:31] do anything and i was just laying there
[36:33] and i was i had a serious conviction on
[36:35] my heart i was wow lord i'm sorry you
[36:37] know i'm sorry i did this and i just was
[36:39] praying and i i was just trying you know
[36:41] i was saying well maybe i just won't do
[36:42] it very often or i'm just trying to you
[36:44] know how we do kind of scapegoat around
[36:46] it a little bit you know
[36:48] i'm sorry lord but you know but
[36:51] the lord doesn't like butts amen
[36:54] so he was just dealing with me on that
[36:56] and so finally i just i lifted my hands
[36:58] i said lord i won't take it if this is
[37:00] something you know i'll call him you
[37:02] know tomorrow and i'll
[37:03] you know i'll
[37:05] say i decline it or and i'll have to go
[37:07] through that that awkward phone call
[37:09] that that awkward conversation um but
[37:11] friends you know the lord works in
[37:13] peculiar ways in mysterious ways and
[37:16] that makes us because we have the holy
[37:18] spirit it causes us to be peculiar amen
[37:20] and so i did i had to have a weird phone
[37:23] call an awkward conversation but it was
[37:25] it was led of the lord amen um
[37:28] uh
[37:31] it's just what a little bit of what i
[37:32] want to get into tonight just um how the
[37:35] spirit spirit-led lives of you know holy
[37:38] ghost-filled christians are often very
[37:39] peculiar
[37:41] so oftentimes a task that the lord has
[37:43] in store for our lives we feel unfit for
[37:45] and unready to do
[37:47] and another thing that was spoken at
[37:48] that meeting um in certain situations if
[37:52] you know if you're going through
[37:52] something or if if you feel like you're
[37:55] in a place that you shouldn't be in uh
[37:58] if you're unfit to do that task the lord
[38:01] the lord's ways are higher than our our
[38:03] ways and his thoughts are higher than
[38:04] our thoughts so he'll if he places you
[38:06] into a position to do something or to be
[38:08] somebody then and and it's of him and
[38:11] it's and you're being spirit-led even if
[38:13] you feel unfit he will prepare you he
[38:15] will do on-the-job training amen and i
[38:17] thought that spoke to my heart a lot
[38:19] yeah i definitely don't feel like i need
[38:20] to be up here but he's doing all the job
[38:22] training amen so i'm just praising god
[38:24] for that
[38:25] satan has specific attacks that he uses
[38:27] to get us out of the will of god to
[38:29] question our faith to destroy our
[38:31] confidence in the leading of the lord he
[38:33] uses doubt um you know in the garden of
[38:35] eden uses reasoning he uses uneasiness
[38:38] he uses fear of the unknown like what
[38:39] pastor was talking about on sunday
[38:42] and the list just goes on and on and on
[38:45] um there's this there's this evangelist
[38:47] i was uh
[38:50] brother paula fontaine actually quoted
[38:52] him and so i started doing a little bit
[38:53] of research on him his name is watchman
[38:56] knee watchman knee was a faithful
[38:57] chinese evangelist in the early part of
[38:59] the 20th century
[39:01] and he dedicated his life to the work of
[39:03] gosp of the gospel in china
[39:06] in the 1930s and 40s watchmen actually
[39:08] had a you know faithful ministry of the
[39:10] gospel with his brothers in shanghai
[39:12] china where they labor for the lord but
[39:14] in 1949
[39:16] which is near the end of the second
[39:17] world war and now the nationalist
[39:19] government of china fell and the
[39:21] struggle for christians in that country
[39:23] really began but his the burden was
[39:25] still upon his heart he was still a
[39:27] spirit-led christian and he still had
[39:28] that burden so at that time
[39:31] watchmen sent his brothers
[39:33] actually one of his brother's names was
[39:35] witness which is cool
[39:37] he sent his brothers that were
[39:39] faithfully working with him in the
[39:40] gospel at that time in taiwan he sent
[39:42] them to taiwan
[39:44] but he had a burden on his heart to
[39:46] return to mainland china where all the
[39:48] controversy was going on where where
[39:51] that government had fallen
[39:53] and to continue the work there by the
[39:55] leading of the holy spirit amen
[39:58] in an attempt to get his brother not to
[40:00] return to the to to the mainland um
[40:03] watchman's brother witness sent this
[40:05] advisement and but received a peculiar
[40:07] response he said before brother knee
[40:10] left hong kong brother lee advised him
[40:14] many times not to return to the mainland
[40:16] but brother nee said if a mother
[40:18] discovered that her house was on fire
[40:20] and she herself was outside the house
[40:23] doing the laundry what would she do
[40:25] although she realized the danger would
[40:27] she not rush into her home although i
[40:29] know that my return is fraught with
[40:31] dangers i know that many brothers and
[40:34] sisters are still inside how can i not
[40:37] return and that spoke to my heart so
[40:39] vastly because this is this is happening
[40:42] you know 75 years ago friends this isn't
[40:44] you know this isn't hundreds and hundred
[40:45] years ago in this in the bible this is
[40:47] this is happening now watchmen knee was
[40:49] arrested in 1952 because of his
[40:52] professed faith in christ so he was
[40:53] there evangelizing for two years doing a
[40:56] work and as well
[40:58] um he he had because of his professed
[41:01] faith in christ and his leadership in
[41:02] the local churches
[41:04] he was falsely condemned judged and sit
[41:07] sentenced in 1956 to 15 years of
[41:10] imprisonment
[41:12] although prisons didn't allow him to
[41:14] mention the lord's name in his letters
[41:18] his final letter written on the day of
[41:20] his death he alluded to the joy in the
[41:23] lord and it says in my sickness i still
[41:26] remain joyful at heart couldn't say the
[41:28] name of the lord but he used a scripture
[41:31] he used philippians 4 4 where it says
[41:34] rejoice in the lord always in my
[41:36] sickness i remain joyful at heart and
[41:38] watchman knee was practicing that word
[41:40] from apostle paul by the time watchman
[41:43] knee was arrested in 1952
[41:46] listen to this friends approximately 400
[41:48] local churches had been raised up in
[41:50] china in addition over 30 local churches
[41:54] had been raised up in the philippines
[41:55] and in singapore in malaysia and
[41:57] thailand and indonesia because why
[42:00] because he followed the leadership of
[42:01] the holy spirit amen
[42:04] simply put so this is one of his
[42:05] writings i have a few a few of his
[42:07] writings here but one of his writing
[42:08] says put verily very simply we were just
[42:10] talking about the devices that satan
[42:12] uses in in our lives amen put very
[42:14] simply satan's power in the world is
[42:16] everywhere yet wherever men and women
[42:19] walk in the spirit sensitive to the
[42:21] anointing they have from god
[42:24] that power of his of satan's just
[42:26] evaporates there is a line drawn there
[42:29] by god a boundary where by virtue of his
[42:32] own very presence satan's writ does not
[42:35] run
[42:36] let god occupy all the space himself and
[42:39] what room is left for the evil one amen
[42:42] friends what room is left for the evil
[42:44] one
[42:45] another one says it is imperative that
[42:47] believers recognize a spirit exists
[42:49] within them friends we have to recognize
[42:52] it is imperative it is it is it is so
[42:55] important to recognize that a holy
[42:56] spirit lives inside of you and if
[42:59] something extra is thought knowledge and
[43:01] imagination of the mind something beyond
[43:03] affection beyond sensation and pleasure
[43:05] of emotion something additional to
[43:07] desire decision and action of will
[43:10] it says god's children must be very
[43:13] humble before him and seek to know the
[43:16] teaching of the bible and the
[43:18] functioning of the spirit through the
[43:20] holy spirit in order that they may walk
[43:22] in the spirit amen we have to be very
[43:25] humble and to know that
[43:27] in order to walk in the spirit through
[43:29] the holy spirit we have to seek him amen
[43:33] this last one is where i kind of want to
[43:35] pivot here the book of acts is the best
[43:37] aid this is something that washmani said
[43:39] he says the book of acts is the best aid
[43:41] in approaching our work we do not find
[43:44] there anyone consecrating himself as a
[43:46] preacher nor anyone deciding to do the
[43:49] lord's work by making himself a
[43:50] missionary or a pastor amen he's talking
[43:52] about the book of acts what we do see is
[43:55] the holy spirit himself
[43:58] appointing and sending men out to do the
[44:01] work amen that's what we that's what we
[44:03] see in the book of acts and in this
[44:04] quotation it leads me to the thought
[44:06] that being spirit-led a spirit-led
[44:08] christian is supposed to closely
[44:10] resemble the book of acts church amen
[44:13] friends we're supposed to be living
[44:14] right now in the book of acts church the
[44:16] early apostles in acts had freshly
[44:18] received the greatest gift they had ever
[44:20] been given amen the holy spirit and that
[44:22] was their guide to preach the gospel
[44:24] amen
[44:26] let's look in acts 9 you guys if you
[44:28] want to turn with me you can it's in
[44:29] acts 9 and verse 1 but it's a familiar
[44:32] story so you don't have to turn with me
[44:33] but it it talks on the conversion of of
[44:36] saul
[44:37] saul was on the road to damascus with
[44:38] intentions of how the scripture states
[44:40] yeah let's turn it let's turn actually
[44:42] amen it's
[44:43] acts chapter 9
[44:45] just so we get a little outline of
[44:47] what's going on here in acts chapter 9
[44:49] and verse 1
[44:52] the conversion and saul yet breathing
[44:54] out so
[44:55] this was saul on the road to damascus
[44:57] and on on his way on his way to damascus
[45:02] his thought and his intention
[45:04] was
[45:05] to breathe out threatenings and to to
[45:07] slaughter the disciples of the lord that
[45:10] was that was his intention that would
[45:12] that was what he was that was what he
[45:14] was going to do amen but friends a light
[45:16] shine down we're all familiar with the
[45:18] story a light shine down friends and
[45:21] blinded saul and gave him instructions
[45:24] he said he said lord what will i do
[45:28] he said go forward and wait
[45:31] amen
[45:33] so a few verses later we we see that
[45:35] ananias sees a vision from the lord
[45:38] and he says to go unto saul
[45:42] and pray for him and instruct him on
[45:44] what on what to do but ananias knew
[45:47] who saul was and what he had done amen
[45:50] he saw
[45:53] he knew that saul was a murderer he knew
[45:56] that saul hated
[45:58] jesus
[46:00] and he knew how evil he was but the lord
[46:03] said to an eyes go anyway
[46:05] amen
[46:07] it was a peculiar thing to do and then
[46:09] friends we we read in um
[46:11] our opening verse in peter you know
[46:13] we're we're a set apart nation we're a
[46:15] peculiar people friends i'm going to say
[46:17] that word a lot peculiar i i had to
[46:20] practice it a lot because it's a hard
[46:21] word to say but peculiar we are a very
[46:23] peculiar people amen ananias heeded to
[46:26] the lord's call and went to saul he
[46:29] prayed over him and he was filled with
[46:31] the holy ghost and that's in acts 9 17
[46:33] amen friends he heeded what did he do he
[46:36] heeded to the call amen friends a few
[46:38] chapters later
[46:40] we're just kind of building up to
[46:41] something here a few chapters later paul
[46:43] was converted and now preaching the very
[46:45] name he persecuted just a few days
[46:47] earlier obviously he didn't have the
[46:49] credibility because of of his reputation
[46:52] but then another faithful servant of the
[46:53] cross which actually becomes his
[46:55] companion later on barnabas
[46:57] by the unusual leadings of the holy
[46:59] ghost sticks up for paul in verse 27 of
[47:02] acts chapter 9 and it was another
[47:03] peculiar thing that happened he was led
[47:05] by the holy spirit to change the course
[47:08] of history
[47:09] amen
[47:10] moving forward in chapters 15 chapters
[47:13] 15 and 16 specifically we see that paul
[47:15] now on his second missionary journey had
[47:17] already gone on one he had already given
[47:19] his heart to god he had already received
[47:20] the gift of the holy ghost he had this
[47:22] intention to go on a journey and the
[47:24] intention was to go into each city where
[47:26] he had previously been on his first
[47:28] missionary trip and to see how they were
[47:30] doing
[47:31] but the holy spirit had other plans amen
[47:34] he had other plans for tonight he had
[47:35] other plans for paul amen of course they
[47:38] made plans to go to a certain province
[47:40] but in acts chapter 16 verses 6 through
[47:43] 8 we can turn there if we want
[47:45] they were kept from preaching a certain
[47:48] in a certain part of asia let's let's
[47:50] turn friends
[47:51] in acts chapter 16 verses 6 through 8
[47:55] it says now when they had gone
[47:56] throughout uh
[47:59] fergia and the region of galatia and
[48:01] were forbidden of the holy ghost to
[48:03] preach the word in asia after they were
[48:05] come to my asia they assayed to go to
[48:08] bithya but the spirit suffered them not
[48:11] the spirit had other intentions and they
[48:13] passing by maija came to treos so they
[48:16] came into this place into treos
[48:18] and during paul's time in treos him and
[48:21] his companion
[48:23] were at a loss of where to go next their
[48:25] original plan had changed and
[48:27] their route was going into a different
[48:29] direction and they they didn't they
[48:31] didn't know they were they were hanging
[48:32] on by
[48:35] by the leading of the spirit amen
[48:36] friends
[48:38] that night after praying and waiting on
[48:39] the lord which is exactly what we're
[48:41] supposed to do in every situation that's
[48:43] exactly what paul did he was praying and
[48:44] he was waiting on the lord
[48:47] paul went to lay his head to rest after
[48:49] after praying after talking with talking
[48:51] with his companion i think he was with
[48:52] timothy he was talking and they were
[48:54] just
[48:55] what are we going to do i don't know the
[48:56] lord hasn't spoke to me what do you
[48:58] think what do you think you should do
[48:59] what where do you think we should go i'm
[49:00] not sure we're just going to wait on the
[49:02] lord amen so they waited on the lord
[49:04] paul went to go lay his head to rest
[49:06] when a vision appeared to him
[49:08] and i want you to i want you to focus in
[49:10] on here now a man of macedonia appeared
[49:13] to him and says in in verse 9 a vision
[49:16] appeared to paul in the night and there
[49:18] stood a man of macedonia and prayed him
[49:20] saying come over in macedonia and help
[49:23] us
[49:24] after he had seen the vision immediately
[49:26] we endeavored to go into macedonia
[49:28] assuredly gathering that the lord had
[49:30] called us to preach the gospel unto them
[49:32] friends they were led of the spirit to
[49:35] go into this place into macedonia
[49:38] they were in a strange land
[49:41] and just for active drama you know they
[49:43] probably hadn't showered in weeks
[49:45] food was scarce but none of that
[49:48] mattered to them the only thing that
[49:50] mattered was the gospel the gospel needs
[49:52] to get to wherever the lord has it to go
[49:55] amen friends
[49:59] they were learning to be subject to his
[50:02] leading
[50:03] they were learning to be completely
[50:05] dependent on him remember friends we
[50:08] cannot be independent of god we have to
[50:10] be dependent on him
[50:12] that's the way we have to live we have
[50:14] to be completely reliant on his leading
[50:16] even in times when it seems so peculiar
[50:19] amen we want to do you want to know the
[50:21] outcome of that trip the outcome of that
[50:23] trip is they obeyed the vision they went
[50:26] into macedonia which is specifically
[50:27] into three places which we all are
[50:29] familiar with philippi
[50:31] thessalonika and corinth do those things
[50:33] those three things sound familiar
[50:35] thessalonians corinthians
[50:37] philippians we wouldn't have those
[50:39] scriptures in the bible we wouldn't have
[50:40] we wouldn't have that encouragement if
[50:42] the if they hadn't heeded to the call of
[50:44] the holy spirit to go into macedonia and
[50:46] to say these things and do these things
[50:48] and then friends they were called this
[50:50] area today this is what this is what got
[50:52] me friends this area today
[50:55] is still now known as the gateway into
[50:59] europe
[51:00] historians say that up until that point
[51:02] the gospel had been limited to just asia
[51:06] and many historians credit paul's
[51:07] heeding to that macedonian call with the
[51:10] spread of christianity into europe and
[51:12] the entire western world
[51:14] all because ananias and paul heeded to
[51:18] this the leading of the holy spirit
[51:20] they got they got the gospel into a
[51:22] place it had never been before friends
[51:25] they a simple messenger subjected
[51:27] himself to the leadings of the holy
[51:29] spirit and spread the gospel into the
[51:31] part of the world it had not yet been
[51:34] praised the name of god that is imagine
[51:37] friends if he did that with them back
[51:40] then what his spirit can lead each and
[51:42] every one of us to do right now today we
[51:45] have to we have to just heed that word
[51:48] that word heed is talked a lot about in
[51:49] the bible it just take notice of we have
[51:52] to take notice of his leading his call
[51:55] his spirit amen
[51:58] i want to take a look at another story
[51:59] that while we're going forward
[52:01] in
[52:02] gideon let's turn to um gideon in this
[52:06] uh the book of judges i'm sorry the book
[52:08] of judges the sixth chapter
[52:21] amen
[52:23] this has been
[52:25] this book this story had been has been
[52:27] speaking to me actually a lot lately
[52:29] about in a lot of different ways
[52:31] but tonight how it spoke to me
[52:33] specifically was being led of the lord
[52:38] so gideon a little background with
[52:40] gideon he was an uneducated farmer from
[52:42] the country
[52:43] it talks about in verse in chapter 6
[52:46] unequipped in his own mind
[52:49] to save
[52:51] israel from the hand of the midianites
[52:53] the lord appeared to him an angel
[52:55] appeared before gideon and said thou
[52:57] mighty man of valor i have a task for
[53:00] you to do you're going to save the
[53:02] you're going to save
[53:04] um yeah we can turn first i think he
[53:06] just had it verse 12. the angel of the
[53:08] lord appeared unto him and said unto him
[53:09] the lord is with thee thou mighty man of
[53:11] valor
[53:13] the lord um
[53:14] in verse 14 the lord looked upon him and
[53:16] said go this thou might thou shalt save
[53:19] israel from the hand of the midianites
[53:21] have i not sent thee
[53:24] some bible commentary i was reading goes
[53:26] through the story of gideon and actually
[53:29] considers gideon to be a coward with no
[53:33] faith
[53:34] now i want you to just think about that
[53:35] for a second friends because we're going
[53:37] to go into to the reasons why but from
[53:40] carnal eyes with these three reasons
[53:42] it actually starts to make sense
[53:44] reasoning starts to kick in and it was
[53:46] like wow maybe he was a coward but from
[53:48] carnalize you look
[53:50] but from spiritual eyes you look and
[53:51] you're like so the first thing
[53:54] that gideon does he asks for a sign in
[53:56] verse 17 that the angel had actually
[53:59] talked to him
[54:01] and he said unto him if now i if i have
[54:02] found grace in my sight show me a sign
[54:04] that thou talkest to me
[54:07] second he laid a fleece before the lord
[54:10] in verses 36 and 37 and asked for a
[54:14] clear-cut sign that it was his direction
[54:17] and commission to lead israel into
[54:19] victory we can turn there in verse 30
[54:22] verse 36 and verse 37 it says and gideon
[54:24] said unto god if thou will save israel
[54:26] by mine hand as thou has said
[54:29] i will
[54:30] uh
[54:32] behold i will put a fleece of wool in
[54:34] the floor and if the dew be on the
[54:36] fleece only and it be dry upon all the
[54:38] even the earth beside then shall i know
[54:41] that thou wilt save israel by mine hand
[54:44] hast thou has said and what did god do
[54:46] the lord granted his request
[54:48] his circumstances dictated his action
[54:51] friends he had something he had a great
[54:54] task to be done he was an uneducated
[54:57] farmer that the lord spoke to and said
[54:59] you are going to go before israel or
[55:01] you're going to take israel and you're
[55:02] going to deliver them out of the hand of
[55:04] the midianites
[55:06] what do you mean lord i'm a i'm a farmer
[55:09] how do you expect me to do this
[55:12] so he you know what he does
[55:14] he doesn't he doesn't just accept the
[55:16] first sign
[55:17] he doesn't just accept the second sign
[55:19] with the fleece
[55:21] he lays another fleece before the lord
[55:23] but this time he asked it to be done the
[55:25] opposite way of the first fleece just so
[55:28] he knew that it was the lord
[55:32] the lord's direction
[55:34] and guess what god did
[55:36] the lord granted his request once more
[55:40] his circumstances dictated his action
[55:42] friends put yourself in his shoes he was
[55:44] asked by the lord to lead that army
[55:48] when the angel appeared unto gideon god
[55:51] already knew his attributes
[55:53] he already knew the very first thing he
[55:55] said to him he said gideon thou art a
[55:57] mighty man of valor how do you know that
[56:00] if he if he didn't see his spirit within
[56:02] him
[56:04] you may even get to a point to think
[56:07] like those commentators did
[56:09] i was reading
[56:11] and you know
[56:13] he had to lay a fleece before the lord
[56:15] and he had to you know he had to have
[56:16] the angel perform a sign and and he had
[56:19] to lay another fleece before the lord
[56:21] and i mean god had already given his
[56:23] word
[56:24] you know gideon already had the
[56:25] instruction does that sometimes happen
[56:27] in our lives god has already given you a
[56:28] word he has already given you
[56:29] instruction why did he lack faith to
[56:32] move forward with the plan god had given
[56:34] him why why why did he lack that faith
[56:37] friends if you ask me laying out the
[56:39] fleece
[56:40] before the lord
[56:41] didn't question his faith it proved his
[56:44] faith it proved that he wanted to be
[56:46] completely led by the lord and not do
[56:49] anything until he was sure it was god
[56:51] speaking to him amen a great task was
[56:55] placed upon him and he wanted to ensure
[56:57] that it was the lord's perfect will and
[56:59] not his own amen friends i'm so many
[57:02] times we i think that of that story and
[57:04] with carnal eyes you look at it you had
[57:06] to lay these he wanted to be completely
[57:08] led of the lord he had a great task at
[57:10] hand we have a great task at hand in
[57:12] these last days i want to be completely
[57:14] led of the lord i don't want to go on my
[57:16] own path i don't want to do my own thing
[57:18] i don't want to make my own decisions i
[57:20] don't i don't i i can't because i know
[57:23] that i can't do it i can't do it by my
[57:24] own will i have to do it by his will you
[57:27] know friends there's something that
[57:27] spoke to me that did you know that in
[57:30] hebrews so gideon was talked about in
[57:31] hebrews chapter 11. in hebrews chapter
[57:34] 11 it says you know there is a total of
[57:37] 16 names spoken about in hebrews chapter
[57:39] 11. 16 names i did a little uh research
[57:42] with dr google he helped me out a little
[57:44] bit there's over 3 200 names mentioned
[57:47] in the bible there's like 327 i think
[57:50] don't quote me on that
[57:52] mentioned in the whole bible and 16 made
[57:54] the cut 16
[57:57] that is less
[57:59] than half of 1
[58:02] less than half of 1
[58:04] made the faith hall of fame and guess
[58:06] who was one of them gideon
[58:10] i don't think god makes mistakes do
[58:12] y'all do you think god makes mistakes
[58:14] gideon sought direction from the lord at
[58:17] every step during his commission that's
[58:19] what he did has this happened to you god
[58:21] gives you a great task or a great
[58:22] decision or something that you need to
[58:23] do whatever may be friends god wants to
[58:25] direct your paths he doesn't want to
[58:27] just give you a direction and then you
[58:29] go out and do it on your own he wants to
[58:31] give you direction and then guide you
[58:34] the whole way through it amen friends
[58:39] his confirmation
[58:42] of completing the task
[58:44] many times in our spirit we pray for
[58:46] certain things and ask the lord for
[58:48] direction and what we receive isn't what
[58:51] we want to hear this is something
[58:52] personal to me sometimes i'll pray
[58:55] and in the back of my mind i may already
[58:57] have that decision made up in my mind
[58:59] amen anybody else guilty of that we you
[59:01] know we we want the lord to lead us and
[59:03] we want the lord to guide us but
[59:05] sometimes it's
[59:07] we think we know what's what's best for
[59:08] ourselves amen so we pray because we
[59:11] know we're supposed to but then we step
[59:14] out and and we say okay well you know
[59:17] maybe we receive that that word but it's
[59:19] not exactly the word that we wanted to
[59:20] receive and and it wasn't exactly the
[59:23] way that we wanted to go but we still go
[59:25] the way that we wanted to go anybody
[59:27] guilty that i know i have been
[59:29] and
[59:30] and it's at those times that maybe we
[59:32] might reject the lord's leading a little
[59:34] bit or maybe just sidestep it from what
[59:37] we know is right amen
[59:42] has
[59:43] it
[59:44] i'll be praying about something
[59:47] it may even be something minor
[59:50] but i'll ask for his direction deep down
[59:52] in my heart
[59:56] even though i've known that that
[59:58] decision is already made
[1:00:02] or if there's something maybe i'm
[1:00:03] leaning more towards
[1:00:05] and then god through his holy spirit
[1:00:08] that each one of us have amen i hope we
[1:00:10] all have it amen
[1:00:12] will give me an answer the opposite of
[1:00:15] what i wanted to hear
[1:00:17] anybody guilty of that that's happened
[1:00:19] so many times
[1:00:21] it's times like that when it is most
[1:00:24] difficult to follow the leadership
[1:00:28] the most difficult
[1:00:30] but god wants to teach us his ways
[1:00:33] he wants us to learn
[1:00:35] how to follow every word of god amen
[1:00:41] you know another thing that you know
[1:00:44] when we go through things or when we
[1:00:46] have something in our life that we want
[1:00:47] to pray about and i i've been guilty of
[1:00:50] it too
[1:00:51] um
[1:00:52] we
[1:00:53] spend a few minutes in prayer about it
[1:00:56] you know we wake up in the morning and
[1:00:57] we
[1:00:58] you know we ask the lord maybe for 30
[1:01:00] seconds lord would you help me with this
[1:01:02] or would you help me with that and then
[1:01:04] we have to go through our day you know
[1:01:05] we got to drive to work and we we have
[1:01:07] to you know do a certain thing and then
[1:01:08] we got to come home and we gotta you
[1:01:10] know maybe make some food and you know
[1:01:12] maybe you know do something or whatever
[1:01:15] it is and then we get we get to our our
[1:01:16] night and we need to relax right so then
[1:01:18] we you know maybe we might pick up the
[1:01:20] bible for 10 or 15 minutes or whatever
[1:01:23] and then maybe before we go to bed we we
[1:01:25] pray for 30 seconds or maybe for five
[1:01:27] minutes or maybe for 10 minutes how does
[1:01:29] the lord know that we're serious when we
[1:01:31] do that friends
[1:01:32] how will the lord ever know we're
[1:01:34] serious if we can't even spend five
[1:01:37] minutes in prayer with him and i've been
[1:01:39] guilty of it i'm looking at you but
[1:01:40] there's a mirror right here i've been so
[1:01:42] guilty of that so many times i'll spend
[1:01:44] i have something on my heart maybe that
[1:01:46] i need the lord to guide me and lead me
[1:01:48] it's a serious decision or it's a
[1:01:50] serious task or whatever the case may be
[1:01:52] and i spend three minutes in the morning
[1:01:54] and you know four and a half minutes at
[1:01:56] night maybe throughout the day i'll have
[1:01:58] it on my mind but am i praying i know
[1:02:00] the bible says to pray without ceasing
[1:02:01] but am i praying am i really am i really
[1:02:04] going before the lord are you going
[1:02:06] before the lord with this task that's
[1:02:07] what gideon did he went before the lord
[1:02:09] with that fleece because he wanted to
[1:02:11] make sure that his direction was
[1:02:13] completely led of the spirit amen do we
[1:02:15] ever really do that do we ever lay that
[1:02:17] fleece before the lord and say lord is
[1:02:19] this really what you want me to do is
[1:02:21] this really the way that you want me to
[1:02:22] go we need to we need to do that more
[1:02:24] friends amen i'm guilty i need to do it
[1:02:25] more
[1:02:27] we ought to be like gideon more times he
[1:02:29] had a big battle ahead we have big
[1:02:31] battles ahead friends i'm gonna tell you
[1:02:32] right now you've got if you're not in
[1:02:34] one then you're gonna be in one and if
[1:02:36] you know if you're not gonna be in one
[1:02:38] you just came out of one and you're
[1:02:39] probably in 14 right now amen but
[1:02:43] we have to be sure
[1:02:45] and he wanted to be sure
[1:02:47] i got a personal testimony i wanted to
[1:02:49] share i was you know talking to my
[1:02:50] parents about it a little bit and it
[1:02:52] happened when i was younger so i
[1:02:54] i needed to refresh myself on it but
[1:02:57] when i was younger we lived in indiana
[1:03:00] and my grandpa had just um
[1:03:03] within the past i don't know the exact
[1:03:05] timeline but he had closed his church he
[1:03:07] had he had a lot of sickness so we were
[1:03:08] going to to churches that were that were
[1:03:10] hours away um we were going to one
[1:03:13] church and it was two and a half hours
[1:03:14] and then we would maybe go for a while
[1:03:16] to another church but it was it was it
[1:03:17] was far it was a distance
[1:03:19] and um we were kind of out of fellowship
[1:03:23] and so the my dad mama had it on their
[1:03:25] heart to to
[1:03:26] put their kids us me and my sister into
[1:03:29] a place into a church get them into a
[1:03:31] church that had young people their age
[1:03:33] amen friends and that's that was a that
[1:03:34] was a heavy burden on their heart
[1:03:37] and
[1:03:38] him and my mom started searching and
[1:03:40] praying
[1:03:42] and so
[1:03:43] he felt like he had to move he wasn't
[1:03:46] sure yet what that meant or where that
[1:03:48] where that was to but he but he felt
[1:03:50] like he had that he had that he had that
[1:03:52] burden on his heart i need to get them
[1:03:53] into a church i need to get to him into
[1:03:54] a place i just don't know
[1:03:56] where so they started searching they
[1:03:59] started praying
[1:04:00] we sold our house and we moved in with
[1:04:02] our grandparents
[1:04:04] and we started visiting other churches
[1:04:05] you know we came
[1:04:07] here praise the lord and we came we went
[1:04:09] to arizona and we went to north carolina
[1:04:11] and we went to a different a bunch of
[1:04:12] different churches and he just wasn't
[1:04:13] sure where exactly the lord wanted him
[1:04:15] he you know he was he was praying and he
[1:04:17] was searching he was waiting on the lord
[1:04:20] he was asking for his leadership
[1:04:22] you know he owned a good business there
[1:04:24] we had a really nice house
[1:04:26] from the perspective of anyone looking
[1:04:28] at the outside when we look at it from
[1:04:29] carnal eyes it didn't make any sense to
[1:04:32] move didn't make any sense
[1:04:34] but friends when you're led of the
[1:04:36] spirit of the lord
[1:04:37] it's peculiar
[1:04:39] amen
[1:04:40] one day during a service um
[1:04:43] actually brother jewel was the one that
[1:04:44] was preaching that service he was
[1:04:46] feeling my dad was feeling the weight of
[1:04:48] all these changes and he just wasn't
[1:04:50] sure
[1:04:51] exactly what the lord wanted and and you
[1:04:54] know he had already sold the house and
[1:04:55] now he what you know we had come and
[1:04:57] visit here and you know he thought this
[1:04:59] was the place but that's a big that's a
[1:05:00] big change you know to move to a
[1:05:02] different place to move to
[1:05:04] not having a not knowing where you're
[1:05:06] supposed to
[1:05:07] be not having a place lined up not
[1:05:09] having a job lined up that's a that's a
[1:05:11] hard place to be in especially as a
[1:05:12] parent as a father i don't know yet but
[1:05:14] i will know soon amen two months three
[1:05:16] months
[1:05:18] um
[1:05:19] it was it was a peculiar thing for him
[1:05:23] and he wasn't sure
[1:05:25] if it was exactly what the lord wanted
[1:05:28] friends gideon wasn't sure that it was
[1:05:31] exactly what the lord wanted
[1:05:33] so what did he do he desired he desired
[1:05:35] to be spirit-led no matter how hard it
[1:05:38] was
[1:05:39] he was leaving his family we had all of
[1:05:41] his family live there he was my mom was
[1:05:43] leaving her family he was leaving a
[1:05:45] great job a nice house a
[1:05:48] pretty good life from the outside amen
[1:05:50] but god had other intentions for us amen
[1:05:53] praise god
[1:05:54] that service he was in
[1:05:57] he was in great travail he was just the
[1:06:00] lord had placed a heavy burden on him
[1:06:02] and he just didn't he wasn't sure
[1:06:05] he just raised his hands and he was just
[1:06:07] praying and asking and he was waiting on
[1:06:09] a confirmation he began praying in that
[1:06:11] service
[1:06:12] for something specific
[1:06:14] amen sometimes we need to be specific
[1:06:16] with god
[1:06:17] he likes it when we're specific
[1:06:20] little did he know that my mom was
[1:06:22] sitting next to him
[1:06:24] not telling him but praying the exact
[1:06:27] same prayer that he was
[1:06:29] praying for the exact same thing
[1:06:31] you'll never be able to convince me
[1:06:34] that there is not a leading of the holy
[1:06:36] spirit when something is placed upon
[1:06:39] your heart and you are impressed so
[1:06:42] deeply about something that is the holy
[1:06:44] spirit and when you know that his spirit
[1:06:47] led there is not you can't tell me that
[1:06:48] that isn't the holy spirit amen you
[1:06:50] can't tell me that that isn't real
[1:06:52] they prayed
[1:06:54] that once brother jewell closed that
[1:06:55] service that he would walk right back to
[1:06:57] him and then he would lay his hands on
[1:06:59] him
[1:07:01] and praise god
[1:07:03] for a minister who was under the spirit
[1:07:05] and under the anointing
[1:07:07] because they prayed that prayer
[1:07:08] specifically and brother jewell
[1:07:11] being led by that same spirit that was
[1:07:13] in both of them did that exact thing he
[1:07:16] closed the service really quick and i've
[1:07:18] actually i haven't been in one of
[1:07:20] brother jewel services in a long time
[1:07:21] but usually you know he sings after and
[1:07:23] maybe he'll go back to the office or
[1:07:24] hell of a prayer line or something but
[1:07:26] he closed immediately and he gave it
[1:07:28] back to the song leader he didn't sing
[1:07:30] any songs and he walked didn't go walk
[1:07:32] to the back office he walked straight to
[1:07:34] where my dad was sitting he's laid his
[1:07:35] hands on him and he just prayed over him
[1:07:37] friends that was the holy spirit leading
[1:07:39] him amen friends
[1:07:41] he closed that service
[1:07:43] just like gideon my dad didn't know what
[1:07:48] what the lord desired for him
[1:07:51] so he wanted to be sure
[1:07:53] amen friends he wanted to be sure that
[1:07:56] it was
[1:07:57] that he was guiding his entire path not
[1:08:00] just the main decision but every little
[1:08:01] decision along the way
[1:08:06] there's a story
[1:08:11] there's a story that
[1:08:14] brother benham tells in being led by the
[1:08:16] spirit in 1950
[1:08:19] that really spoke to my heart the other
[1:08:20] day
[1:08:22] and it was about
[1:08:24] brother branham had just come back from
[1:08:26] he was coming back from a meeting
[1:08:28] and he
[1:08:31] was flying from i believe texas back
[1:08:33] home
[1:08:34] and
[1:08:35] some plane troubles happened or some
[1:08:37] weather happened
[1:08:38] and the plane had to ground in memphis
[1:08:40] so when the plane grounded in memphis
[1:08:45] the airline actually
[1:08:48] gave him
[1:08:49] a free a free night at a hotel they gave
[1:08:51] him a limousine to drive back they gave
[1:08:53] him the whole nine yards so he went back
[1:08:55] there and he was just he was writing
[1:08:56] some letters and he was just praying and
[1:08:58] he thought oh i'm you know i'm just
[1:08:59] gonna i'm just gonna write some letters
[1:09:01] pray and then go to bed
[1:09:03] so we had an early wake-up call and i
[1:09:05] think his flight was at seven so he went
[1:09:07] to bed early and he woke up really early
[1:09:09] the next morning and he just he had
[1:09:11] these letters written so he decided he
[1:09:13] was gonna walk
[1:09:14] down to the post office that morning
[1:09:16] before the limousine was gonna come and
[1:09:18] pick him up
[1:09:19] to go to his to his flight so he just
[1:09:21] started walking and he was just walking
[1:09:25] and all of a sudden something started
[1:09:27] impressing on him he was just walking he
[1:09:29] hadn't even made it to the post office
[1:09:30] yet and he's the lord the holy spirit
[1:09:33] said turn around go go the other way
[1:09:36] and he just kept walking sometimes we do
[1:09:39] that this is a prophet amen this is a
[1:09:41] prophet and he wasn't sure so he just
[1:09:43] kept walking kept walking and all of a
[1:09:45] sudden it it said it again turn around
[1:09:48] and go the other way so he stopped and
[1:09:50] he looks into a window
[1:09:52] and i don't remember what he was looking
[1:09:53] at but he looks into a window and he
[1:09:54] just bows his head and he just prays
[1:09:56] lord is that is that you is that you
[1:09:58] telling me to go the other way turn back
[1:09:59] around
[1:10:02] and the spirit just told him turn around
[1:10:04] and go the other way
[1:10:09] there was someone
[1:10:11] that was patiently waiting
[1:10:13] that had that same holy spirit in them
[1:10:16] that was praying
[1:10:18] that grounded a plane from texas to
[1:10:21] indiana right in memphis that caused an
[1:10:24] airline to pay for a hotel because she
[1:10:26] had a burden upon her heart for her son
[1:10:29] that was laying in his bed dying on his
[1:10:32] deathbed
[1:10:33] she had a burden upon her heart and she
[1:10:35] believed she he said in the story she
[1:10:37] believed that the holy spirit was still
[1:10:40] alive and that it still led people so
[1:10:43] she believed that so she said that she
[1:10:45] was praying and that you know the lord
[1:10:48] how the story exactly goes is um
[1:10:51] he tells it a in a few different places
[1:10:53] but you know he he comes up to the he
[1:10:56] walks finally up to this fence and he
[1:10:58] sees this old lady and he was just him
[1:11:00] and a hymn and he walks up to and he
[1:11:02] sees this old lady and she's just
[1:11:04] sitting on this hint on this fence and
[1:11:06] you know she's just tears are just
[1:11:08] running down her eyes

[1:13:08] and he
[1:13:09] they just go in and she sees they see
[1:13:11] them
[1:13:12] they see this boy you know just laying
[1:13:14] down and travail and
[1:13:16] what was happening everything that she
[1:13:18] had told him
[1:13:20] and he just asked her he said
[1:13:24] will you pray first
[1:13:26] you know he he said he said i've been in
[1:13:28] i've been in king's houses kings palaces
[1:13:30] i've been in you know i've been in the
[1:13:32] greatest places in the world but i felt
[1:13:34] more at home in that little shack of
[1:13:36] that little old woman than i've ever
[1:13:37] felt in my whole life
[1:13:39] because the holy spirit was there
[1:13:41] friends we feel at home and the holy
[1:13:43] spirit's there if we've got it amen and
[1:13:45] he just went in and he said he said man
[1:13:47] we
[1:13:48] you go ahead and pray and she started
[1:13:50] praying and he said man it was the
[1:13:52] anointing was there she knew how to pray
[1:13:55] knew all the old-fashioned pray she was
[1:13:57] just praying and she was praying
[1:14:01] and
[1:14:04] she gets done praying and he's just lord
[1:14:06] is you know is this why you had me come
[1:14:08] here is this is this what you want me to
[1:14:09] do still questioning
[1:14:12] so he prays he prays that prayer he just
[1:14:15] says you know i don't know exactly the
[1:14:17] prayer he prayed but he prayed
[1:14:20] and that boy
[1:14:22] health came back into that boy after
[1:14:24] that prayer that woman's faith that was
[1:14:27] led to the holy spirit to have that
[1:14:29] plane grounded to go to that certain
[1:14:31] certain place to speak to a certain
[1:14:33] minister to have him come into his house
[1:14:35] to pray over her
[1:14:36] that faith caused that boy to come back
[1:14:39] from where that place was he was in and
[1:14:41] he said that he talked to her two years
[1:14:43] later and that boy was serving the lord
[1:14:45] and doing exactly what he was supposed
[1:14:46] to be doing amen friends that can happen
[1:14:49] with each and every one of us for any
[1:14:50] request that is that's a story but that
[1:14:52] can happen if you just place yourself
[1:14:54] into that position he's the same god
[1:14:56] he's the same god that does that friends
[1:14:59] the holy spirit will impress you friends
[1:15:01] to do certain things and it's peculiar
[1:15:04] it makes us do peculiar things that we
[1:15:06] just don't understand it didn't make
[1:15:08] sense for him to turn around and go the
[1:15:09] other way he didn't have time he had 15
[1:15:12] 20 minutes to go to the post office and
[1:15:14] to do this and then he needed to get
[1:15:15] back to catch a taxi to go fly home
[1:15:18] because he had just been on all these
[1:15:19] meetings but that's not what the holy
[1:15:21] spirit had intended holy spirit the holy
[1:15:23] spirit didn't
[1:15:24] didn't care about what time he needed to
[1:15:26] be home he cared they she cared about
[1:15:28] that that woman's request because she
[1:15:30] was in travail she had a request upon
[1:15:32] her heart friends when you have a
[1:15:33] request upon your heart and you lay it
[1:15:35] before the lord and you ask and you know
[1:15:37] that you're going to receive when you
[1:15:38] ask then he'll do something for you we
[1:15:41] have to be sensitive to his leading we
[1:15:43] have to be sensitive to the leading of
[1:15:45] the spirit it's a dynamic process always
[1:15:48] moving always flowing
[1:15:50] even a prophet of god we notice in that
[1:15:52] story even a prophet of god at times was
[1:15:55] unclear if he was doing what the lord's
[1:15:58] will was
[1:15:59] he wasn't sure
[1:16:00] you know gideon wasn't sure
[1:16:03] paul wasn't positive but we're impressed
[1:16:07] a certain way to do a certain thing and
[1:16:09] if we step out on faith and do that
[1:16:11] thing as long as we're sensitive and we
[1:16:14] have him direct our whole path the whole
[1:16:16] way then he will lead and guide us every
[1:16:19] step of the way amen
[1:16:21] we just have to be sensitive to the
[1:16:23] leading of his spirit hallelujah friends
[1:16:26] oh praise god paul once said in
[1:16:29] calling jesus on the scene 1963 paul
[1:16:32] said the life that i once live i live no
[1:16:34] more not me but the christ that lives in
[1:16:36] me that's it he had just passed from
[1:16:38] death unto life and christ was alive in
[1:16:41] him safely secured christ was the one
[1:16:44] guiding the ship paul just had to sit in
[1:16:46] it still and obey notice god will make
[1:16:49] our bodies obey him and he just said in
[1:16:52] saint john the sixth chapter he eats my
[1:16:54] flesh and drinks my blood he has
[1:16:55] everlasting life and i will raise him up
[1:16:57] in the last day
[1:16:59] think of it friends our bodies
[1:17:01] obey when we have no more control over
[1:17:04] it and turns back to a spoonful of dust
[1:17:08] god will speak to that body and it will
[1:17:09] rise up again in the likeness of the
[1:17:12] resurrected jesus christ what are you
[1:17:14] worrying about it is in the hands of god
[1:17:18] let's go amen he will rise it up what
[1:17:20] day he promised to do it that's thus
[1:17:23] saith the lord he's written it in his
[1:17:25] word what are you scared about in this
[1:17:26] little ship he is in it friends he was
[1:17:29] in it with paul friends he was in it
[1:17:32] with gideon he was in it with ananias he
[1:17:34] was in it with my dad he was in it with
[1:17:35] me he's in it with you friends he's in
[1:17:38] that ship remember jesus said to follow
[1:17:40] me and get rid of what you got follow me
[1:17:42] that's the only way to have eternal life
[1:17:44] that's the only remedy he gives this man
[1:17:48] it was the only rhythm that he gives
[1:17:49] businessman it's the only remedy he
[1:17:51] gives anybody
[1:17:52] his choice he makes his decision so it's
[1:17:55] perfect every time and we must
[1:17:58] follow him it's the only way to have
[1:18:01] eternal life so the leadership of god is
[1:18:03] listen to this the leadership of god is
[1:18:05] to follow the vindicated word of the
[1:18:07] hour by
[1:18:09] the holy ghost by the leading of the
[1:18:11] holy ghost that was from leadership
[1:18:13] 1965. that's exactly what watchmen knee
[1:18:17] had to do he had to follow the
[1:18:18] leadership of the lord and even though
[1:18:19] he went and put he was put in prison he
[1:18:21] was doing a work and a service for the
[1:18:22] lord god and that was the way that he
[1:18:24] was supposed to go he died amen

[1:24:24] dreamed
[1:24:26] i'm
[1:24:27] learning to
[1:24:30] [Music]
[1:24:36] you know the lord wanted to speak
[1:24:37] tonight and i believe that he did amen i
[1:24:40] believe that the lord had a something
[1:24:42] that maybe you know as the phrase says
[1:24:45] still water
[1:24:46] goes deep runs deep and it was maybe
[1:24:49] something that you've heard something
[1:24:51] that was simple but yet so profound
[1:24:54] i believe the lord spoke to hearts
[1:24:56] because there were people praying maybe
[1:24:57] out there in this church maybe you were
[1:24:59] praying about something asking the lord
[1:25:02] to come by and speak to you and lord
[1:25:04] used our brother caleb amen here tonight
[1:25:06] thank you brother caleb amen for
[1:25:08] yielding to the holy spirit i love that
[1:25:11] so much and brother adam said he's the
[1:25:12] same god
[1:25:14] the same god that grounded a plane
[1:25:17] you know i was hearing that story even
[1:25:19] just a few i remember hearing that a few
[1:25:21] months ago and brother branham said that
[1:25:22] little
