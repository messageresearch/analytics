[31:28] called rebuilding Eden I would like to
[31:30] say I do have one prayer request to take
[31:32] for sister Phyllis who has an unspoken
[31:35] request and she lost her keys this
[31:38] morning so we're gonna pray that the
[31:40] holy spirit will uh

[31:54] excellent better now praise God happy to
[31:58] have you here today this uh for all of
[32:00] you all who don't know the back story uh
[32:03] this this young man grew up with our
[32:05] kids and his mom and dad and uh where uh
[32:08] my his dad and and myself
[32:11] um are related and and and distant
[32:13] cousins but we grew up together and I
[32:16] haven't seen him in a long time praise
[32:18] the Lord amen if you ever heard me tell
[32:20] the story of the little three-year-old
[32:22] that I wore out for climbing on a
[32:24] dresser and thought it was Chris it
[32:26] turned out to be Terry
[32:28] assistant it was you're right he's the
[32:32] one who started it Terry
[32:34] Chris you owe him quite a bit
[32:37] and then I had to repent to his parents
[32:40] and uh they of course his dad thought it
[32:43] was funny he said well he probably
[32:44] needed it
[32:46] amen praise the lord well we're happy to
[32:49] have you here good to see you amen so um
[32:52] I wanted also to to just say I I
[32:56] actually had it on my schedule for
[32:58] Wednesday
[32:59] and it got past me and then I was
[33:01] actually glad that I could wait till
[33:02] Sunday when more of you were here I just
[33:05] wanted to express how much sister Debbie
[33:07] now when those cards that you got and
[33:09] the birthday and the cake and the
[33:11] celebration and and the the trickery
[33:14] that um sister Hannah pulled on me
[33:18] amen LED astray by a little girl and uh
[33:22] she led me right into the Trap amen and
[33:26] so we're happy I just wanted to say how
[33:28] much I appreciate that it really warmed
[33:31] my heart sister Debbie as well so thank
[33:33] you and God bless you amen James chapter
[33:36] one we're just going to catch a couple
[33:38] of verses and then we're going to go
[33:39] right to Matthew chapter 12.
[33:45] James chapter 1 verses 17 and 18.
[33:50] every good gift
[33:52] and every perfect gift is from above you
[33:57] get anything good and perfect it come
[33:59] from God
[34:00] because Satan is just a perverter and
[34:03] he's he has one motive and that's to
[34:06] destroy all right every good gift and
[34:09] every perfect gift is from above and
[34:13] cometh down from the Father of Lights
[34:16] with whom is no variableness no neither
[34:21] shadow of turning so I've expressed to
[34:24] you many times that this is a great
[34:28] testimony to Hebrews 13 and 8 that Jesus
[34:32] Christ is the same all the time
[34:35] yesterday today and forever he he does
[34:37] it as we've as we've said rather
[34:40] humorously he doesn't wake up on the
[34:42] wrong side of the bed he doesn't wake up
[34:44] in a bad mood he doesn't have a bad hair
[34:46] day
[34:47] he's always amicable he's always Fair
[34:51] he's always
[34:52] warm-hearted he's always full of love
[34:55] he's always trying to help
[34:58] always
[35:00] the Bible says that his throne is
[35:03] established in Mercy say well but wow
[35:07] I've got a pretty bad track record
[35:08] surely he can't love me but the Bible
[35:11] says that that Mercy rejoiceth against
[35:14] judgment see so so just
[35:18] um just be aware of that look at this
[35:20] second verse 9 verse 18. of his own will
[35:25] of his own will
[35:27] beget he us with the word of Truth that
[35:32] we should be a kind of first fruits of
[35:35] his creatures so the way he gets you to
[35:39] be like him which is why you were built
[35:43] the whole purpose of life and the Earth
[35:45] is for God to have a kingdom amen and
[35:48] he's going to have a kingdom of saints
[35:50] that are like him and you were born the
[35:53] opposite of him
[35:54] so the way he's going to get you back to
[35:56] being like him he's going to send his
[35:58] word you're going to believe it it's
[36:00] going to create a new birth experience
[36:02] in you and then your life will start
[36:04] turning around and you'll start being
[36:06] like him and and on Resurrection morning
[36:08] you'll be exactly like him even to even
[36:11] you have a body like his glorified body
[36:16] amen so
[36:19] um these verses
[36:21] um tell us I want you to notice before I
[36:24] let you be seated and I'll read my
[36:25] second text with you seated but just
[36:27] catch this now
[36:28] so these verses tell us a little bit
[36:32] about him
[36:33] right every good gift is from him every
[36:36] perfect gift is from him he has no
[36:39] variables he has no shadow of turning
[36:41] right it tells us a little bit about him
[36:44] it also tells us some of his intentions
[36:47] to save us for his kingdom he says here
[36:52] he's going to be goddess with the word
[36:54] of truths so that we can be kind of like
[36:57] first fruits of his creation like
[36:58] offspring
[37:00] you see so and then and then we finally
[37:03] realize that they not only tell us a
[37:05] little bit about him and his intentions
[37:07] to save us for his kingdom but it tells
[37:10] us a little bit about what we will be
[37:12] seen as by him you will be viewed as his
[37:17] offspring
[37:18] wow that you you there's no better deal
[37:21] in the in the universe than that than to
[37:23] be considered The Offspring of God
[37:26] you've heard me say it many times uh
[37:30] maybe I'll say it for the sake of our
[37:31] visitors our future is bright
[37:34] friends our future is bright is it any
[37:37] wonder that once you get this little
[37:39] small window uh into into what's been
[37:43] and what lays ahead my no wonder we can
[37:47] love him the way we do let's pray father
[37:49] we thank you for your word that's been
[37:52] read this morning
[37:54] I'm committing myself Lord to your
[37:57] anointing there's once again this is
[38:00] just a series that I'm going through
[38:02] step by step as I feel led of the Holy
[38:04] Spirit it'd be impossible to get it all
[38:06] today not even a chance of that so we
[38:09] just want to try to get the portion that
[38:12] you want for today so I committed to you
[38:16] Lord completely into your hands take
[38:18] take this vessel take the preacher take
[38:22] the hearers take every Spirit under your
[38:25] control for the glory of God may you
[38:28] help sister Phyllis find her keys today
[38:31] may you bless her in the unspoken
[38:34] request that she has today May It Be So
[38:37] Lord we ask big of thee in Jesus name
[38:40] amen God bless you friends you can be
[38:43] seated and we're going to turn to
[38:44] Matthew chapter 12.
[38:49] now I'm definitely going to
[38:53] I'm reading both of these passages for
[38:55] my opening text I don't think I will
[38:58] really get to the substance of this
[39:00] second text but per Adventure I do and
[39:03] it goes faster than I think then I want
[39:06] to go ahead I don't want to have to read
[39:07] it
[39:08] um down down the path Matthew chapter 12
[39:11] verses 38 to 42.
[39:15] then certain of the scribes and the
[39:18] Pharisees answered saying Master we
[39:21] would see a sign from thee
[39:23] but he answered and said unto them
[39:26] an evil and adulterous generation
[39:30] seeketh after a sign and there shall no
[39:34] sign be given to it but the sign of the
[39:37] prophet Jonah now
[39:40] I want you to catch something here
[39:42] it's not it's not unusual
[39:46] for people to want to see the
[39:48] supernatural That's Not Unusual and God
[39:52] very often times brings forth the
[39:55] supernatural
[39:57] but remember that the the supernatural
[40:00] that we cease signs and wonders and
[40:04] miracles he's always done that but
[40:07] that's never really
[40:09] the proof of God that's just evidence
[40:14] it's evidence it and it accumulates and
[40:18] and you have an accumulative uh idea IDE
[40:21] idea that God must be true he must be
[40:24] real because I see Supernatural things
[40:27] that are happening in front of me that
[40:31] aren't natural
[40:33] they're super natural
[40:36] they can't happen in nature the laws of
[40:40] physics even in the quantum world would
[40:42] not allow what I'm seeing therefore it
[40:44] must be something even beyond that and a
[40:47] lot of times mankind Humanity doesn't
[40:50] know what it is they think maybe there's
[40:52] some energy up there there's some being
[40:54] they're not sure what it is some of them
[40:56] don't believe in a being at all they
[40:58] believe this is it I find that to be a
[41:00] heartbreakingly sad way to look at life
[41:03] my goodness if if this is it then why in
[41:06] the world did I even come here because
[41:08] all you all you do is you're born and
[41:10] job said you're a man born of a woman is
[41:13] just a few days and full of trouble
[41:15] you can look on the streets and look in
[41:17] the headlines and this ain't a world uh
[41:20] that that's a very good place it has a
[41:23] lot of good people in it but I'm glad
[41:25] that God's going to take it back over
[41:26] and turn it back into a good place
[41:29] so I'm glad to know that there's
[41:31] something uh after this world as as
[41:34] you've heard you know many times I'm in
[41:37] preaching funerals and you take that
[41:38] scripture where Jesus said you know
[41:40] you've believed in God believe in me in
[41:43] my father's house are many mansions and
[41:45] if it weren't so I would just tell you
[41:48] the truth I'm just that honest that's
[41:49] what Jesus is saying I'm just honest if
[41:52] this wasn't true if I was tricking you I
[41:55] would just own it I would just tell you
[41:57] but what I'm telling you is is there's a
[41:59] world out there and I'm going to prepare
[42:02] it so that when you get there and oh yes
[42:04] you're going to get there
[42:06] see and so that where I am you can be
[42:08] also and and and brother Branham is
[42:11] saying how he says Jesus what Jesus is
[42:13] saying to his disciples is that this
[42:16] life is not ended in death
[42:19] that there's a there's a whole nother
[42:22] life after this life is over that is a
[42:26] continuation of this same life in
[42:29] another world
[42:30] which actually is just another dimension
[42:33] because heaven is going to be right here
[42:35] on this Earth the Bible makes that very
[42:37] clear only it won't be under the rule of
[42:41] man it'll be back under the rulership of
[42:43] God's word
[42:45] so we we find him here
[42:48] saying to these people you're going to
[42:50] read here in verse 39 he answered to
[42:52] them and said an evil and adulterous
[42:53] generation seeketh after a sign but
[42:56] there won't be a sign given it except
[42:58] Jonah now what made Jonah A Sign was
[43:03] because it was a fulfillment of the word
[43:07] Jesus wasn't there to be a circus act
[43:10] for them he wasn't there to clown for
[43:12] them and and you know and and he went
[43:15] about Healing The Sick only because he
[43:17] had a kind heart and he came and he said
[43:21] the the the the healthy don't need a
[43:23] physician but it's the sick they said
[43:24] why do you go among Sinners he said
[43:26] because it's the Sinners who need me see
[43:28] and so so we find that he went about the
[43:32] Bible says doing good what was he doing
[43:34] he was showing the love of God see so so
[43:38] we find he says but but if you if you
[43:42] won't take the Fulfillment of the word
[43:44] as the sign and all you want me to do is
[43:48] do some magic tricks for you
[43:50] you're evil
[43:52] you're evil if all you're doing is
[43:55] chasing after you know uh spectacular
[43:58] things that can tantalize your mind but
[44:01] you refuse when I have showed you my
[44:04] word and I fulfilled my word and it even
[44:06] came to pass in your day and you don't
[44:08] you won't receive that
[44:11] and then you want me to do a magic trick
[44:14] you're evil
[44:16] that's an evil heart
[44:18] he says for as Jonah verse 40 was three
[44:21] days and nights in the whale's belly
[44:23] so shall the son of man be three days
[44:25] and three nights in the heart of the
[44:27] earth see and so when I read that that
[44:31] he's saying the son of man will be this
[44:34] amount of time in the heart of the Earth
[44:37] you've never attended a funeral
[44:40] in all your life where you expected the
[44:43] person to just be there for three days
[44:48] I've never preached one I've never went
[44:50] to one where everybody said okay three
[44:53] days from now
[44:54] but Jesus is saying here three days and
[44:58] that's it I'll be back
[45:00] see so why am I a Christian today
[45:04] because he said he would do it and he
[45:07] did
[45:08] say how do you know he rose cause I met
[45:10] him
[45:11] he lives inside me changed my whole
[45:14] heart changed my whole mind changed my
[45:16] whole life
[45:19] watch as he goes on verse 41 the men of
[45:21] Nineveh
[45:22] shall rise in judgment see that's why
[45:25] it's such Folly it is such Folly these
[45:29] people running around you know trying to
[45:31] believe or disbelieve the sign and the
[45:34] sign to to be believed is the word of
[45:36] God being fulfilled what God said he
[45:39] would do he said how the world would be
[45:40] at the end he said this is what I'll do
[45:42] right before I destroy it and he did it
[45:44] and we have it
[45:46] so they can argue about a bridge and a
[45:48] cloud and a bear all they want to that's
[45:50] just evidence
[45:51] but I I already have the proof of what
[45:55] he has done in this day
[45:58] changed my life changed my world
[46:03] the men of Nineveh now watch this now
[46:05] here's here's what he's going to say to
[46:07] these evil-hearted people who he was the
[46:10] word fulfilled he was Isaiah's prophecy
[46:12] and they're refusing it
[46:14] they're wanting a magic trick
[46:16] Isaiah had told him what would happen
[46:18] and here he is and they're not accepting
[46:20] it
[46:21] and he says to them the men of Nineveh
[46:23] shall rise in judgment with this
[46:25] generation and shall condemn it because
[46:28] they repented at the preaching of Jonah
[46:31] they were they were heathens
[46:34] and here's Israelites who are supposed
[46:36] to be God's people
[46:38] as as brother Adam said the the most
[46:41] holy
[46:42] City
[46:43] with the most holy people
[46:46] took the most holy person
[46:49] and gave him the most cruel death
[46:55] he says the men the men of Nineveh shall
[46:57] rise and judge you see because they
[47:00] repented at the preaching of Jonah and
[47:03] behold a greater than Jonah is here
[47:06] speaking of himself a greater than
[47:08] Jonah's here and you're still not
[47:10] believing it and heathens believed a
[47:12] lesser version
[47:14] verse 42 the queen of the South this is
[47:17] the Queen of Sheba
[47:19] the queen of the South shall rise up in
[47:23] the Judgment with this generation and
[47:26] shall condemn it for she came from the
[47:29] uttermost parts of the Earth
[47:33] this queen of the South she came from
[47:34] the uttermost parts of the Earth
[47:37] to hear the wisdom of Solomon and behold
[47:41] a greater than Solomon is here
[47:45] so you know at the at the beginning of
[47:50] of part two in this series today is part
[47:52] three in fact
[47:54] at the beginning of part two
[47:57] uh we found ourselves looking back in
[47:59] time we went way back we went way back
[48:03] further than Genesis 1 1 in the
[48:05] beginning God created the heavens Earth
[48:07] we went back beyond that say does the
[48:09] bible take us there sure John 1 takes us
[48:12] back in the beginning was the word it
[48:14] was with God and was God and we we found
[48:17] way back there that before there was an
[48:20] earth before there were stars before
[48:23] there were galaxies or anything there
[48:27] was God
[48:29] we found that that great eternal spirit
[48:31] that filled all time space and Eternity
[48:36] and and here in our day the prophet
[48:39] described God in that in that way back
[48:42] period
[48:44] he used a metaphor so that we as humans
[48:47] could try to get our mind wrapped around
[48:49] wow what does that even mean this great
[48:52] being that predated stars and galaxies
[48:55] and space and and he filled all time
[48:59] space and Eternity how do you even get
[49:01] your mind around that
[49:03] well you can't fully because you're this
[49:06] this right here is in a finite condition
[49:07] and you won't be able to fully
[49:09] comprehend who he is and even who you
[49:11] are and how the relation works until we
[49:14] cross to the other side the Bible says
[49:16] then we'll know as we're known
[49:20] so so here we it's a walk of faith we
[49:24] have to walk by faith Jesus had to do
[49:27] that in fact is Jesus was a faithful
[49:31] high priest now what made him a faithful
[49:33] high priest because in always tempted as
[49:36] we were as we are he was
[49:38] he was he had to literally endure
[49:41] everything that you and I have to endure
[49:44] so that he could know what it feels like
[49:47] as a mortal
[49:48] as a man God came down and became a man
[49:51] Jesus wasn't a second person in the
[49:54] godhead that's ancient Babylonian
[49:57] polytheism he never was that it's all
[50:00] wrapped up in expression but he God
[50:02] became a man and walked the Earth and
[50:05] felt what it feels like to get sick to
[50:08] get lonely to be rejected to have his
[50:11] feelings hurt he felt what it feels like
[50:13] to have love and then to lose someone
[50:15] you love
[50:17] he felt Jesus as a human felt what it
[50:22] felt like to not know what tomorrow
[50:25] holds
[50:28] he had to walk just like you only
[50:31] knowing who holds tomorrow
[50:33] see he says that all through the
[50:35] scripture you find that brother I'm
[50:36] taught that very clearly you know he he
[50:39] he's walking through a crowd and the
[50:41] woman with a blood issue she's had it
[50:43] for years and no doctor can help her and
[50:45] she slips in because she said in her
[50:47] heart if I can just Touch the Hem of His
[50:49] Garment
[50:50] and there's no way he would have felt
[50:52] that she didn't tug on it she didn't
[50:54] grab it she just touched it and it hung
[50:57] loose from his body and it was even an
[50:58] outer layer it's impossible for a human
[51:00] to feel that and he didn't feel her
[51:03] physical touch on his on His Garment but
[51:06] he felt strength go out of his body he
[51:08] felt himself getting weak and he knew
[51:11] somebody had contacted his father and
[51:13] had Drew healing out of him oh my
[51:16] because why he was a fountain of healing
[51:20] and he turns around and he says who
[51:23] touched me
[51:24] and brother Brandon points out two
[51:26] things he said first of all he didn't
[51:28] know who touched him
[51:30] second of all and he didn't know until
[51:33] the woman came trembling forward and
[51:35] revealed her own self and then he didn't
[51:38] know what was wrong with her
[51:39] until others showed him
[51:42] and he says I do everything by Vision
[51:45] the son does nothing but what he sees
[51:47] the father doing Jesus so God
[51:50] intentionally limited his own self and
[51:53] his Humanity remember remember that he
[51:56] he who thought it he thought it not to
[51:58] be robbery to say I am God I'm equal to
[52:01] God if you see God you see me the one
[52:04] who didn't think that was robbery laid
[52:06] aside his Splendor in heaven and came
[52:08] down Paul said and took the form of a
[52:11] servant and became a man among us
[52:14] and there he walked and he had to walk
[52:17] daily and and from his Humanity God hid
[52:21] and and he had to get a download every
[52:24] day on what to do
[52:26] even even after his resurrection
[52:30] he comes to the Mount and they they want
[52:32] to know about the coming of the Lord and
[52:34] the restoration of Israel and Jesus you
[52:37] know in one place in the gospels when
[52:39] he's talking about that he says now of
[52:42] that day no man noeth not even the son
[52:46] even I don't know it and when they ask
[52:49] him on the mountain well you're now will
[52:51] you now restore the he said now that's
[52:53] just in God's hands I that that's that's
[52:55] not for you to know I don't even know
[52:58] myself only God alone has that but but
[53:01] we find that when he ascended and he
[53:06] went from living in a human body even
[53:09] glorified that body got laid on The
[53:11] Mercy Seat so that there's a Perpetual
[53:13] atonement for you and me
[53:16] that even if I make a failure God is
[53:19] only looking at My Sacrifice he doesn't
[53:21] see my failure Hallelujah
[53:25] and but when he went back he said I come
[53:27] from God I go back to God in other words
[53:29] when he went from a human back to being
[53:31] the pillar of fire that met Paul on the
[53:34] road to Damascus and said I'm Jesus and
[53:37] it was a pillar of fire it went back to
[53:40] that one that led Israel through the
[53:42] Wilderness who met Moses in a burning
[53:44] bush
[53:46] and now he can come to John on the Isle
[53:48] of patmans and he can give him the whole
[53:51] revelation of everything that's going to
[53:53] happen because now he knows everything
[53:56] makes clear and who is this Melchizedek
[53:59] he bypassed theophany he says now I mean
[54:02] he came from theophany to word he said
[54:04] you bypass that because in that form he
[54:07] note all things
[54:08] but not in his human form
[54:10] and therefore that's why the Bible you
[54:13] know I think it's John or is it Peter I
[54:15] don't remember said
[54:16] that we have known Christ in the flesh
[54:19] but henceforth know we him no longer
[54:23] now he's went back to the pillar of Fire
[54:26] and the responsibility to be the word
[54:29] made flesh is now transferred to his
[54:32] church to his bride the voice the voice
[54:35] of God in the earth now that that that
[54:37] that word made flesh is in a
[54:40] many-membered pride
[54:42] friends it is humbling
[54:45] and difficult to get your mind around
[54:49] that you walk around here today
[54:52] with knowledge of of the events of the
[54:55] world and knowledge of the coming of the
[54:57] Lord that even Jesus though he knows now
[55:01] but in his Earthly Ministry he didn't
[55:03] even know you know more now than he knew
[55:06] then
[55:08] that that's blasphemous in some circles
[55:11] but that's what the Bible shows us
[55:14] this has now been what kind of
[55:16] responsibility do we have that the
[55:19] mysteries of the Kingdom have been
[55:21] entrusted to us say oh I want to write
[55:24] it in a book and go put it in a cave
[55:26] somewhere no don't write it behind skin
[55:29] and be the Living Word to the last age
[55:33] oh I hope you're catching that
[55:40] so so we find that
[55:43] brother Branham is trying to describe
[55:46] how
[55:48] how would a prophet
[55:50] who can see through prophetic lenses and
[55:53] understand things and doesn't tell us
[55:56] everything he said God doesn't tell His
[55:58] prophets everything and Prophets don't
[56:00] tell the people everything
[56:03] he said many times God will tell me and
[56:05] show me stuff he said I can't say
[56:06] anything about it
[56:08] but here's a case where he was given
[56:11] Liberty to describe what God is like
[56:14] back in the eternities before he was a
[56:17] man
[56:18] before he was a pillar of Fire
[56:21] before there was anything
[56:23] there was just God Alone with his
[56:25] thoughts
[56:27] and the closest that he could use as a
[56:30] metaphor
[56:31] is to describe and he described we read
[56:35] it last time in part two he described it
[56:37] like a great fountain
[56:41] way back in the eternities
[56:43] and out of this great Fountain we we
[56:47] found that you know it it it it it it it
[56:50] it was it flowed everything good flowed
[56:53] out of it you know as as this being
[56:57] flowed pure love and and pure truth and
[57:02] pure joy uncut uncontaminated Joy
[57:06] uncontaminated uh truth pure truth pure
[57:10] honesty pure loyalty ever no wonder no
[57:15] wonder James would say in our text oh
[57:18] good gifts and all perfect gifts come
[57:20] down from him who is above they flow
[57:24] down to us from that great Eternal
[57:26] Fountain who then took the form of a
[57:28] pillar of fire and began to whirl
[57:31] and now here he is as a pillar of fire
[57:34] and a prophet said something that could
[57:36] now be seen actually seen physically
[57:40] but at the time that he whirls himself
[57:43] into the pillar of fire to be seen
[57:44] there's still yet nothing to see him
[57:47] and so in that form of the office of sun
[57:50] not us not a son like I have a son who's
[57:53] separate from me it's simply that God
[57:57] transferred himself from that great
[58:00] spirit into a form and you could see it
[58:03] and and therefore it took the title The
[58:06] designation not in English like we think
[58:08] of an offspring a son that's not what
[58:10] Jesus was Jesus was the very God into a
[58:14] form
[58:15] and in that form of the pillar of fire
[58:18] his entire family already existed
[58:22] and down Through the Ages he would
[58:25] Express them into Earth and when they
[58:27] got there it looked like Adam and it
[58:28] looked like an Abel and it looked like a
[58:30] Seth looked like an Abraham looked like
[58:31] a Noah looked like a Moses it was in
[58:33] Isaiah was it Ezekiel it was a David it
[58:35] was a Solomon it was John it was Jesus
[58:38] it was Matthew Mark Luke and John
[58:40] hallelujah it's Luther it's Wesley it's
[58:42] it's Azusa it's the Bride of the last
[58:45] day
[58:46] and here we are friends and you're The
[58:48] Offspring of what God had in his mind
[58:52] before the foundation of the world
[58:57] you're guaranteed not to hear that on
[58:58] the average Sunday morning
[59:01] and we wouldn't know a thing about it if
[59:03] it hadn't been for a prophet in our day
[59:07] so he's describing him in this way but
[59:10] this great fountain
[59:13] alone with his thoughts
[59:15] and the prophet goes on to describe him
[59:18] as lonely
[59:20] was lonely
[59:22] he wanted a family
[59:25] every young man knows that feeling
[59:28] wanted wanted something it's it and and
[59:32] it's hard to you know you you you you
[59:34] want a companion in life
[59:37] you start longing young men you know I
[59:39] can see them grow up and I dedicate them
[59:41] as babies and I baptize them as young
[59:44] men and I watch them grow and they're
[59:46] they're like this one-dimensional person
[59:49] until one day they come to see me and
[59:52] they they got a whole different kind of
[59:53] approach now you know I want you to pray
[59:55] I'm thinking and they're they're
[59:56] starting to respond I want a companion I
[1:00:00] want a mate I I wanna I want to expand I
[1:00:04] want to extend I want to be more
[1:00:09] and it's not all about having more it's
[1:00:11] about being more
[1:00:18] my wife isn't
[1:00:20] she she's what makes me more
[1:00:23] because they too have become one flesh
[1:00:28] and so the strength I can't get
[1:00:30] sidetracked on that today I was almost
[1:00:32] hit this morning studying got a whole
[1:00:34] bunch of notes we'll catch we'll get to
[1:00:36] it in our family series that we're doing
[1:00:38] on the first Wednesday of each month
[1:00:40] but the whole synergetic effect there
[1:00:42] and Synergy is quite a phenomenon
[1:00:45] and uh
[1:00:46] in physics and so it just means that the
[1:00:50] two combined or then they're greater and
[1:00:52] they're stronger and they're more than
[1:00:54] the sum of their individual parts
[1:00:56] or you would say you know 10 plus 10 is
[1:00:59] 20 but by the time you put them together
[1:01:01] it's it's 40 and 100 and 200 and 500 and
[1:01:04] a thousand say where'd this how'd this
[1:01:07] see and then and and science actually
[1:01:09] contract that they they know that one
[1:01:11] horse can pull this much weight but put
[1:01:15] a second horse with him and team them
[1:01:17] together and if you train them to step
[1:01:19] together and pull in harmony they can TR
[1:01:22] they can pull now up to three times what
[1:01:25] the what they could have pulled in to be
[1:01:27] saying oh there are only two of them how
[1:01:28] did it go three times that Synergy see
[1:01:31] and so and that's science can actually
[1:01:34] list why it's working that way because
[1:01:36] now you got four Hooves on the ground
[1:01:37] you got more traction you you've got
[1:01:39] you've got more pull you've got more
[1:01:41] pull from a central tie that goes to the
[1:01:44] weight there's all kinds of of
[1:01:46] scientific things I'm not here to break
[1:01:47] it down today but by the time you take
[1:01:50] that into the supernatural then it's one
[1:01:53] will chase a thousand and two ten
[1:01:55] thousand
[1:01:56] see
[1:01:57] so it goes off the scale once you once
[1:01:59] you get let God have a hold of it let
[1:02:01] God have a hold of your life I promise
[1:02:03] you you'll have a life like you never
[1:02:04] imagined more than you could ever
[1:02:06] accomplish on your own if you just let
[1:02:08] him have your have control of your life
[1:02:12] so he's lonely he wanted a family I
[1:02:14] gotta hurry
[1:02:16] he wanted to share his eternal life with
[1:02:19] someone
[1:02:21] so he comes to Genesis 1 and
[1:02:24] and there God now moving out in his plan
[1:02:28] what is he doing Genesis 1 1 Let There
[1:02:31] Be he says and God created the heavens
[1:02:35] and the Earth
[1:02:37] that's not God just killing time
[1:02:40] that's not God just playing around he's
[1:02:42] not just experimenting in a laboratory
[1:02:44] he's fulfilling a vision from within
[1:02:47] himself
[1:02:48] see when I when I decided I wanted to
[1:02:51] have my wife I wasn't playing games
[1:02:55] I I'm serious and my request will you
[1:02:59] marry me and I I that meant to me and
[1:03:02] when my mom asked me why do you want to
[1:03:04] marry her she knew I loved her I'd been
[1:03:06] dating her for three and a half years
[1:03:07] she said on our wedding day we're
[1:03:08] driving my mom is driving beside I'm
[1:03:10] driving she's riding beside me I just
[1:03:12] want to hear it I want to hear you say
[1:03:13] it why do you want to marry Debbie and I
[1:03:16] thought about it for a moment and I said
[1:03:18] because I'm tired of taking her home
[1:03:23] and I meant that so sincerely I didn't
[1:03:26] want to back out of her driveway and
[1:03:28] wave at her see tomorrow or next Sunday
[1:03:31] or I was done with that I wanted her
[1:03:33] with me all the time everywhere
[1:03:36] I wanted to be more than I was
[1:03:41] and this is what God was doing
[1:03:44] when he was lonely but he wanted a
[1:03:46] family he wanted to share his eternal
[1:03:48] life with someone and so he comes to
[1:03:51] Genesis 1 and God created the heavens
[1:03:55] and the Earth
[1:03:56] but we found in our last study Wednesday
[1:04:00] if you weren't here or just for your
[1:04:02] benefit we found that when he said when
[1:04:06] he created the heavens and the Earth
[1:04:07] though he found that the world was void
[1:04:10] and it was and it was in chaos
[1:04:13] and darkness covered the face of the
[1:04:15] demon Prophet said it was just chaotic
[1:04:18] just just chaos everywhere there was
[1:04:20] there was no semblance it was anything
[1:04:22] but a beautiful garden
[1:04:24] was everything the opposite of that but
[1:04:26] it was a start
[1:04:28] and we find that he comes forward from
[1:04:31] his throne now he's not just satisfied
[1:04:34] to say
[1:04:35] I'll create it let there be an earth Let
[1:04:37] There Be Heavens but he's not just
[1:04:40] satisfied with that now he's going to
[1:04:42] take the next step and he from his
[1:04:44] throne he calls to the Earth let there
[1:04:47] be light
[1:04:48] you see when he saved you he didn't save
[1:04:50] you to leave you like you are he saved
[1:04:53] you to change you and lift you up above
[1:04:56] the Shadows of the sinful world you live
[1:04:59] in and someday set you as his peculiar
[1:05:02] treasure in a brand new world
[1:05:06] and so what is it what is daily
[1:05:08] Christianity about is daily Christianity
[1:05:10] this building hospitals and schools and
[1:05:12] feeding babies and kissing babies that's
[1:05:14] that's fine that's we we show the world
[1:05:17] that we care but my my daily life under
[1:05:21] God as I'm being grown I'm being raised
[1:05:24] I'm being trained I'm being taught I'm
[1:05:27] being I'm being uh manifested
[1:05:30] and when this whole bride around the
[1:05:33] world and that last name on his book is
[1:05:34] called and they're all manifested we're
[1:05:36] going home
[1:05:38] Hallelujah
[1:05:41] so he says let there be light he's still
[1:05:44] doing that today he's still
[1:05:47] commanding light to be born in your life
[1:05:51] light drives out darkness and that's
[1:05:53] what the new birth is about if if the
[1:05:56] new birth
[1:05:57] that you claim you have has not driven
[1:06:00] the darkness from your heart the new
[1:06:02] birth you think you have is a mirage
[1:06:07] I don't say that hurts your feelings and
[1:06:09] say that to help you
[1:06:10] this is a warning collection Danger
[1:06:16] [Laughter]
[1:06:19] the enemy
[1:06:20] what do I do let Christ have control of
[1:06:22] your life
[1:06:24] see he's not interested in just church
[1:06:27] goers the devil's a church goer
[1:06:30] he's trying to change people's whole
[1:06:31] nature
[1:06:33] and so we came and we found that he
[1:06:38] he built a beautiful garden
[1:06:41] in this Garden he had placed his son and
[1:06:44] his son's wife and
[1:06:47] it was beautiful
[1:06:48] it was perfect it was flawless
[1:06:52] I I it's it astonishes me when people
[1:06:56] look at the broken world today whom they
[1:06:58] broke in are breaking
[1:07:00] and somehow want to blame God for that
[1:07:02] why does God let this happen why does
[1:07:04] God let that he was a real God he had
[1:07:06] stopped us if he was a real God he'd
[1:07:07] stop that whoa
[1:07:10] hold on
[1:07:12] when God made it it was perfect
[1:07:15] when God finished it he rested and
[1:07:18] everything he said it was all good
[1:07:22] it was mankind who broke the world and
[1:07:26] today is still breaking it
[1:07:28] see
[1:07:30] God's going to put it back together but
[1:07:32] he he didn't want a kingdom of robots
[1:07:34] and Androids he doesn't want AI
[1:07:38] you understand he wants a family
[1:07:41] I didn't I didn't marry a robot I
[1:07:44] married a woman who would share my
[1:07:46] Visions who thought like me who desired
[1:07:48] like me who Who Loved God like me oh my
[1:07:52] and this is this that's why Paul said
[1:07:55] that the human marriage is just simply a
[1:07:57] scaled down version of what God did God
[1:08:00] that's his whole plan
[1:08:03] see that's why you you understand that
[1:08:05] God had better if you understand it as
[1:08:06] husband and wife instead of father son
[1:08:08] father son is true but it can be
[1:08:10] confusing because then you know
[1:08:12] especially for English-speaking people
[1:08:14] Sun sounds like a separate person but
[1:08:16] but but it's it's always been husband
[1:08:19] and wife and they too shall be one see
[1:08:22] all right
[1:08:25] so when we when we last viewed the
[1:08:28] garden scene this beautiful world this
[1:08:31] perfect Eden
[1:08:33] as we looked on it last Wednesday we
[1:08:35] found that God's perfect Eden had become
[1:08:39] a catastrophe
[1:08:41] a catastrophe
[1:08:43] sin had found its way in and his family
[1:08:46] his son Adam and his Adam's wife Eve had
[1:08:51] made a dreadful mistake and and now his
[1:08:55] son has fallen we showed you last time
[1:08:57] we'll talk about a little bit again Eve
[1:09:00] couldn't bring the world down her sin
[1:09:02] didn't do that her sin didn't even open
[1:09:04] her eyes what she had done
[1:09:06] and she's still with Glee bringing it to
[1:09:09] Adam to show him look what I found
[1:09:12] it was Adam who knew what the problem
[1:09:14] was it was Adam who knew what this meant
[1:09:16] he had two choices I could let her go
[1:09:18] and she'll die with the world or I can
[1:09:20] save her because I know God can't kill
[1:09:22] me because I'm his son
[1:09:24] and if he would kill me that's kill
[1:09:26] himself see and therefore I love this
[1:09:29] woman and so I'm going to step into sin
[1:09:31] with her and protect her
[1:09:33] see
[1:09:35] he did that out of love for Eve
[1:09:40] the Earth had become a catastrophe Eve
[1:09:43] the mother of all living
[1:09:47] seduced and
[1:09:49] tricked by Satan
[1:09:51] had indirectly brought about the
[1:09:53] downfall of all life on Earth and as I
[1:09:56] said at the start she didn't she didn't
[1:09:59] believe that what she was doing was
[1:10:01] wrong and and when the even when the
[1:10:03] deed was done she she didn't know even
[1:10:06] what she had done she didn't realize
[1:10:09] that she was in grave peril
[1:10:12] she'd come back to Adam happy
[1:10:14] she didn't know she was at that moment
[1:10:17] between life and death
[1:10:19] and that this Peril as if that's not bad
[1:10:23] enough it was unrecoverable
[1:10:26] you understand there it was
[1:10:28] unrecoverable by any Act of repentance
[1:10:32] that she could perform
[1:10:34] there was no amount of reparations that
[1:10:38] she could pay it was irreversible and
[1:10:42] unrecoverable by her
[1:10:44] she had no way to bring herself back
[1:10:48] from Doom
[1:10:50] now there's a reason for that
[1:10:53] there's a reason why it had only Adam
[1:10:56] could do that and not Eve
[1:10:59] only Adam could provide the solution Eve
[1:11:02] couldn't there was nothing she could do
[1:11:04] she was helpless and hopeless
[1:11:07] so a little bit about how she got in
[1:11:09] this condition and how Satan so
[1:11:13] easily misled her just like the Bible
[1:11:15] says
[1:11:16] lay aside the weights and sins that so
[1:11:20] easily beset you so that you can run the
[1:11:23] race with race with patience
[1:11:28] we find that the Bible shows us in
[1:11:30] Genesis that
[1:11:32] that before she was expressed as a human
[1:11:36] in the garden
[1:11:38] the Bible shows us that she had a
[1:11:40] pre-existence inside Adam
[1:11:43] she was in Adam
[1:11:46] just like Christ the son of God was God
[1:11:50] and when he expressed himself he came
[1:11:53] from one point to something else and in
[1:11:56] that Pillar of Fire his entire family
[1:11:58] Eve was there listen there as I've said
[1:12:01] to you before Isaiah 42 shows us there
[1:12:04] is only one elected son
[1:12:06] and that's Christ
[1:12:08] he's the only elected son how did I get
[1:12:11] elected because I was in him before the
[1:12:13] foundation of the world
[1:12:15] that's the only way see
[1:12:17] and so so we find that
[1:12:20] that before she was expressed as a human
[1:12:24] the Bible shows us that she existed
[1:12:27] within Adam and this is exactly why when
[1:12:30] God made them
[1:12:32] he called their name Adam
[1:12:37] when he made them he called their plural
[1:12:41] plural name Adam
[1:12:43] because if there was only one expression
[1:12:46] and that was Adam
[1:12:47] and so as Adam goes along he looks at
[1:12:50] nature he sees all the animal kingdom
[1:12:52] and everybody's got a mate but he looked
[1:12:54] all among the creation of God and he
[1:12:56] couldn't find one like him
[1:12:58] and and the and the laws of God don't
[1:13:01] allow for cross-breeding
[1:13:03] every seed had to bring forth of its
[1:13:05] kind so there was so that that that
[1:13:07] means that that while there is
[1:13:10] absolutely such a thing as Bible
[1:13:12] Evolution Charles Darwin missed that key
[1:13:16] point
[1:13:17] God did use Evolution but not crossing
[1:13:20] the species every seed brought forth of
[1:13:22] its kind uh every that's why when you go
[1:13:25] back I asked my science teacher that
[1:13:27] time sister mom uh I I I my my Bible
[1:13:30] teacher and I said Mom my science
[1:13:33] teacher ninth ninth grade 10th grade I
[1:13:34] don't remember he's a he's an
[1:13:36] evolutionist what can I say she says go
[1:13:38] ask him why did it stop
[1:13:42] I said well what does that even mean she
[1:13:43] said well go to the most ancient cave
[1:13:46] paintings they can find that they claim
[1:13:49] are millions of years old and and man is
[1:13:52] painted on there with ten fingers and
[1:13:54] ten toes and a nose on the front and two
[1:13:56] ears on the side and eyes right here and
[1:13:57] a mouth right here and he walks around
[1:13:58] upright and he can he can shoot a bow
[1:14:01] and Hunt animals and and and if
[1:14:03] evolution brought him to that then why
[1:14:05] did it suddenly stop what did you go on
[1:14:07] vacation by now he should have you know
[1:14:09] 40 toes and and 38 fingers and he should
[1:14:12] be you know he should have two heads so
[1:14:14] he can think more clearly you know why
[1:14:16] why did it stop
[1:14:19] if evolution brought him from a tadpole
[1:14:21] why'd it stop yeah
[1:14:25] well I didn't have an answer neither did
[1:14:26] my science teacher
[1:14:29] well I gotta get to my next class here
[1:14:34] still waiting on that answer
[1:14:38] but God did didn't use a form of
[1:14:40] evolution he evoluted up he first he
[1:14:44] started out with the the Sea and the
[1:14:46] creatures and the water and the whales
[1:14:47] and different things and then he then he
[1:14:49] starts making cows and horses and dogs
[1:14:51] and all he starts coming up at polluting
[1:14:52] higher and higher and higher until he
[1:14:54] gets to a man now a man is made in His
[1:14:56] image see
[1:14:58] and so so we find then that that if man
[1:15:03] was going to have a mate
[1:15:05] she would also have to be in His image
[1:15:07] and if he was in God then she would be
[1:15:10] in him
[1:15:11] and so he put Adam to sleep and opened
[1:15:14] up his side just like Jesus had his side
[1:15:17] open to Calvary because he was the
[1:15:19] second Adam and he took Eve out of her
[1:15:21] out and then he made a body and now
[1:15:24] she's standing side by side and Adam can
[1:15:26] look at her and hold her and embrace her
[1:15:28] and they're sweethearts
[1:15:32] so she had her being within the original
[1:15:35] creation that is to say I know brother M
[1:15:39] talks about all the time she wasn't in
[1:15:40] the original creation that's true but
[1:15:42] you have to qualify that by everything
[1:15:43] he said that of course she was she she
[1:15:47] had her being within the original
[1:15:50] creation that is to say she was in Adam
[1:15:53] and she was real
[1:15:55] and she existed see but she had not been
[1:16:00] a part of the original manifestation In
[1:16:04] the Flesh you understand when God
[1:16:06] manifested everything on Earth she was
[1:16:08] not there and Adam's looking around
[1:16:09] where she at where's my mate and God
[1:16:11] says well he's lonely God knew what that
[1:16:14] felt like I was lonely my son is lonely
[1:16:16] I'll put him in a deep sleep I'll take
[1:16:18] her out of him and stand her up beside
[1:16:19] him and it was beautiful
[1:16:23] was genius it was masterpiece now he's
[1:16:26] got a family now he's a little further
[1:16:28] in his great plan because now he's going
[1:16:31] to start from here and it's going to
[1:16:33] multiply he told them multiply multiply
[1:16:35] replenish the Earth replenish the Earth
[1:16:36] because he he's now starting it's kicked
[1:16:39] off it's underway he's headed toward
[1:16:41] making a kingdom
[1:16:44] and then Satan Moves In
[1:16:48] and so
[1:16:49] we find that in this sense
[1:16:52] coming out of Adam she became a
[1:16:55] byproduct
[1:16:56] of God's Wonder working power
[1:16:59] you know to to solve Adam's loneliness
[1:17:02] and to make them Complete because
[1:17:05] neither one of them were in that
[1:17:06] condition
[1:17:08] and a byproduct you know sometimes that
[1:17:11] I don't know why men want to stand on
[1:17:14] that sometimes to you know strut their
[1:17:17] dominance over their wife and treat her
[1:17:19] like a doormat that was nothing like
[1:17:21] that in the Garden of Eden they stood
[1:17:24] equally before God and worshiped God I
[1:17:27] get that the fall came and her desire
[1:17:28] would be to her husband I understand
[1:17:30] that we're not arguing that her place uh
[1:17:32] you know but she has a place
[1:17:35] and she's valuable you say well yeah but
[1:17:38] she's a byproduct byproducts are amazing
[1:17:44] listen
[1:17:46] you know what photosynthesis is
[1:17:48] photosynthesis it's a byproduct of
[1:17:51] carbon dioxide
[1:17:53] try to live without photosynthesis
[1:17:55] photosynthesis
[1:17:57] photosynthesis do you know what it's
[1:17:59] byproduct is you're breathing it
[1:18:02] oxygen
[1:18:04] is that a bad thing I'd say auction is a
[1:18:06] pretty good thing I'm pretty sure I need
[1:18:08] it
[1:18:10] so I would have to say Lord keep the
[1:18:11] carbon dioxide coming so photosynthesis
[1:18:14] can take place so oxygen can be released
[1:18:16] so I can live
[1:18:17] nitrogen that's a that's a that's a
[1:18:20] byproduct
[1:18:21] all all of these different things I mean
[1:18:23] I I have a whole list that I that I'm
[1:18:26] just trying to show you William Brandon
[1:18:28] was never trying to down women that's a
[1:18:30] misunderstanding
[1:18:31] and that's that's men who don't love
[1:18:33] their wives correctly try to stand on
[1:18:36] that was God never intended for it to be
[1:18:39] that way
[1:18:41] never
[1:18:43] see
[1:18:44] so it's it's just simply a prophet
[1:18:46] explaining how she got here and what
[1:18:48] position that put her in see
[1:18:50] and so she she she has her beginning she
[1:18:54] existed in him she's later expressed in
[1:18:56] the flesh she's taken out of Adam in
[1:18:58] this sense she's a byproduct but but
[1:19:01] she's a byproduct of God's Wonder
[1:19:03] working machinery she's a byproduct of
[1:19:05] his Machinery to help Adam's loneliness
[1:19:08] the byproduct was a wife see
[1:19:11] so so but as such
[1:19:14] not being manifested in the original
[1:19:16] sequence of creation she couldn't redeem
[1:19:20] herself from sin
[1:19:22] there's the real catch
[1:19:26] she couldn't since she came that way
[1:19:29] since she was not a direct creation of
[1:19:32] the spoken word of God like Adam was
[1:19:35] she came subsequently to the sequence of
[1:19:38] creation so now she cannot redeem
[1:19:42] herself from sin so much like it is
[1:19:45] today friends we find ourselves in the
[1:19:48] exact same position unable to save
[1:19:50] ourselves from sin and death I had no
[1:19:53] way to save myself I was born in sin I
[1:19:56] was headed for hell I had no chance to
[1:19:58] save myself we come into this world lost
[1:20:00] amen where we come cut off from God we
[1:20:04] come with a fallen nature we're unable
[1:20:06] to trade I can't trade my death for life
[1:20:11] but there was one who could save her
[1:20:15] Hallelujah there was one who could save
[1:20:17] you and who could save me
[1:20:20] the first Adam saved her the second Adam
[1:20:23] saved you and I
[1:20:25] oh
[1:20:26] there would come one to save her
[1:20:30] just as I found one who could save me
[1:20:32] that day
[1:20:33] a second Adam of Christ and I'm here to
[1:20:36] taste something you can find that same
[1:20:38] savior today
[1:20:39] you can you can't save yourself good
[1:20:42] works won't do it you'll never get there
[1:20:45] your best efforts are nothing to they're
[1:20:47] they're God it's not that God doesn't
[1:20:49] appreciate good works but he can only
[1:20:52] the only life that God can can have in
[1:20:55] his presence is his own life
[1:20:58] because he's so pure nothing less than
[1:21:01] his own life can can be in front of him
[1:21:03] so the great and beautiful Plan of
[1:21:06] Redemption is God came down as a man and
[1:21:09] swapped life with you and me and I got
[1:21:13] his life and he took my life and paid
[1:21:15] the price
[1:21:17] and I get the reward imagine that he
[1:21:19] paid the price and I get the reward wow
[1:21:22] how could you not love him how could I
[1:21:25] not love him how could the whole world
[1:21:27] not love him
[1:21:28] universally
[1:21:32] a single worthy one
[1:21:35] who could take our place in judgment and
[1:21:38] set us free
[1:21:39] in her beauty
[1:21:41] and in her innocence
[1:21:44] thinking she had accomplished a great
[1:21:46] thing I'm not going to go a whole lot
[1:21:47] longer
[1:21:49] yeah tons more but I'm just going to get
[1:21:51] to a point and stop
[1:21:55] in her innocence thinking
[1:21:59] when she went along with the Serpent's
[1:22:01] lie
[1:22:03] as Paul said she was seduced
[1:22:06] by the devil
[1:22:09] but thinking that she had accomplished a
[1:22:12] great thing
[1:22:13] she desired to share it with the man she
[1:22:16] loved her Adam
[1:22:19] she had lost sight of the fact here's
[1:22:21] where we were last Wednesday
[1:22:23] she had lost sight of the fact that the
[1:22:26] tree of knowledge of Good and Evil
[1:22:28] and the Tree of Life stood side by side
[1:22:31] in the Garden of Eden
[1:22:34] now brother Branham shows in the
[1:22:36] scripture unmistakably
[1:22:39] you have to just be willfully blind you
[1:22:41] have to deny so many Bible verses you go
[1:22:44] into John's gospel you go into John's
[1:22:46] letters he's the one who always is
[1:22:47] writing about love
[1:22:48] and always about you know he was the
[1:22:50] light and the life of men and the love
[1:22:52] of God and God is love and all these
[1:22:54] different things and and John shows in
[1:22:57] his in the gospels he shows in his
[1:22:59] Epistles that the only
[1:23:02] source of eternal life is Jesus
[1:23:08] John makes that clear there is no other
[1:23:12] source there never has been another
[1:23:14] source of life except Christ
[1:23:19] and and Christ that we're you know we're
[1:23:21] not talking about just limited to the
[1:23:24] baby born in a manger we're talking
[1:23:25] about the one who created the whole
[1:23:27] world Paul said he created All Things by
[1:23:29] Jesus Christ
[1:23:31] John said that in the beginning was the
[1:23:33] word it was God was with God and was God
[1:23:35] it was made flesh and and and through
[1:23:37] him God created all things that are
[1:23:39] everything that is was created by Him
[1:23:41] and for him
[1:23:43] see don't get trapped up in his Humanity
[1:23:46] thinking he's lost somehow less than
[1:23:48] these same Eternal being he's the exact
[1:23:49] same Eternal being only now living as a
[1:23:51] man
[1:23:52] so that he can take the curse of sin
[1:23:54] into his body on your behalf so that he
[1:23:56] could be judged of God guilty and sent
[1:23:58] to hell so you would never have to go
[1:24:01] because he knew if you went to hell you
[1:24:03] couldn't get out he knew if he did he
[1:24:05] could get out easy
[1:24:07] he could walk right down to the devil
[1:24:09] smack him down take the keys loose the
[1:24:10] prisoners
[1:24:11] Ascend right up out of hell and nothing
[1:24:13] could stop him took him right into the
[1:24:15] throne room if God walked him right down
[1:24:16] Glory Lane made a turn on Hallelujah
[1:24:18] Avenue and and pulled right up to the
[1:24:20] throne and said father all these Old
[1:24:21] Testament Saints are yours
[1:24:25] and so so we find that
[1:24:30] that that the prophet shows so if that's
[1:24:33] true and countless scriptures
[1:24:36] show and prove that Jesus is life he's
[1:24:40] the only source therefore if you're
[1:24:43] seeing a tree of life in the garden you
[1:24:46] cannot escape the conclusion that it was
[1:24:48] a person
[1:24:49] it wasn't a tree like a kid would climb
[1:24:53] was a person it was Christ
[1:24:56] once you understand that then you
[1:24:59] realize good grief then the tree of
[1:25:01] knowledge of Good and Evil was also a
[1:25:03] person who was it Satan
[1:25:06] say Satan are you kidding me he was in
[1:25:08] the garden go read Ezekiel
[1:25:10] where Ezekiel says that thou Lucifer was
[1:25:13] in Eden you were in Eden
[1:25:16] you were there and all your beauty and
[1:25:18] so Satan seduces Eve through vicariously
[1:25:23] because he can't bring life like God so
[1:25:26] he he inhabits a beast that was more
[1:25:29] cunning than any other beast called The
[1:25:30] Serpent who walked upright and talked it
[1:25:32] wasn't a snake when's the last time a
[1:25:34] snake talked to you
[1:25:38] or reasoned with you that's ridiculous
[1:25:41] you know sometimes people have to say
[1:25:43] good grief come up out of your Sunday
[1:25:45] school little kid's mind and read the
[1:25:47] scriptures correctly
[1:25:49] and and he was an upright he was more
[1:25:51] cunning and subtle than any Beast walked
[1:25:53] around looked like a man it was that
[1:25:54] Missing Link science tried to find him
[1:25:56] they can't find him the closest link
[1:25:58] they've got is a champ to a man and they
[1:26:00] go how did we get from here to here
[1:26:01] there's something missing they'll never
[1:26:03] find him God cursed his body took his
[1:26:05] legs and arms off of him put him on the
[1:26:07] ground
[1:26:08] see and so so you realize that
[1:26:12] vicariously through the serpent he's he
[1:26:16] takes Eve in seduction
[1:26:17] and then and then she's she's pregnant
[1:26:20] with twins how'd that happen not eating
[1:26:23] an apple
[1:26:25] she's pregnant with twins and one's a uh
[1:26:28] the Son of God and one's the son of the
[1:26:30] devil
[1:26:31] the Bible makes that very clear
[1:26:33] constantly scripture after scripture
[1:26:34] after scripture I'm not here to preach
[1:26:36] on the original sin today I'm trying to
[1:26:38] get I'm trying to get to this last point
[1:26:40] before I close
[1:26:42] but we find that through the cunning of
[1:26:45] the serpent
[1:26:46] he had persuaded Eve that the tree of
[1:26:49] knowledge was the tree to be desired and
[1:26:51] she said that she said the Bible says
[1:26:53] when she saw that it was good for food
[1:26:55] and a tree to be desired to make one
[1:26:58] wise she took see
[1:27:00] and he's doing the same thing today
[1:27:05] he whispers in your ears your young
[1:27:09] people especially he whispers in your
[1:27:11] ears the same way he did Eve trying
[1:27:14] trying to persuade Eve that that the
[1:27:17] tree of knowledge is the way to go
[1:27:18] that's the tree to be desired the world
[1:27:21] is your oyster Eve the world is your
[1:27:25] oyster you you can have whatever you
[1:27:27] want you can have fortune and Glory you
[1:27:30] you can you can have wealth and pleasure
[1:27:32] and and this seduction of Eve devastated
[1:27:37] all creation
[1:27:41] it destroyed Adam's happy home it'll
[1:27:44] destroy your home too
[1:27:46] it'll destroy your home listen husbands
[1:27:50] and wives you owe loyalty to one another
[1:27:52] children you owe loyalty to your parents
[1:27:54] this uh one thing I have to constantly
[1:27:57] tell teenagers this thing is bigger than
[1:27:58] you
[1:27:59] this ain't all about you get out of your
[1:28:01] selfishness and care about your family
[1:28:03] who loves you because if the devil can
[1:28:06] ruin you he can tarnish them
[1:28:08] hallelujah we're all in this thing
[1:28:10] together friends
[1:28:11] Hallelujah
[1:28:15] it destroyed Adam's happy home
[1:28:19] his blessed life as a minor god of the
[1:28:21] earth which is what he was
[1:28:23] for when Adam
[1:28:26] in his great love
[1:28:29] moved to save her
[1:28:31] he fell with her
[1:28:34] and when Adam fell
[1:28:36] since he was the top of creation
[1:28:38] everything under him fell
[1:28:41] all nature collapsed
[1:28:44] it required her Adam the first Adam to
[1:28:47] move for her
[1:28:48] in a way that revealed to her her
[1:28:52] falling condition I'm going to say that
[1:28:53] again that's a big point
[1:28:56] Eve came back from her illicit Affair
[1:28:59] still not knowing it was wrong
[1:29:01] not even knowing she was naked
[1:29:03] her Consciousness still hadn't been
[1:29:05] hadn't been undone she comes back to
[1:29:08] tell him all about it
[1:29:10] but when Adam took her and moved it took
[1:29:13] in other words it took Adam to show to
[1:29:17] her the Peril she was in and the dire
[1:29:20] situation she was in and that she was
[1:29:23] doomed and the only decision now to be
[1:29:26] made is does he sacrifice himself and
[1:29:30] all creation to save her I'm here to
[1:29:33] tell you he did
[1:29:34] and the second Adam did he left his
[1:29:38] throne in glory
[1:29:39] he came down and sacrificed everything
[1:29:41] and stood in judgment not to just die
[1:29:45] for you as brother Dale Smith says but
[1:29:47] to die instead of you
[1:29:50] Hallelujah he died he didn't have to do
[1:29:53] it Adam didn't have to do it
[1:29:56] but but literally the whole world was
[1:29:59] broken when Adam saved her life
[1:30:04] when the serpent brought her the
[1:30:05] knowledge
[1:30:07] still none the wiser but when Adam
[1:30:08] brought her the same knowledge she
[1:30:10] understood in that moment that she was
[1:30:12] now in a fallen condition and sinful she
[1:30:15] knew then the painful truth
[1:30:17] she was lost
[1:30:19] she couldn't save herself and she
[1:30:22] realized that what Adam had just done to
[1:30:24] save her life literally he took her
[1:30:27] penalty upon himself and stood for her
[1:30:31] in judgment
[1:30:33] that friends is what the second Adam did
[1:30:37] for you and me
[1:30:41] it took him
[1:30:43] moving
[1:30:44] I didn't I was like Paul I didn't know I
[1:30:48] was a sinner
[1:30:49] I thought I was a good guy
[1:30:51] I was raised in a good home I was a good
[1:30:54] old boy
[1:30:55] I didn't cheat on people I didn't lie I
[1:30:58] was noble I I was a friend to all men I
[1:31:01] walked around in the earth and and I
[1:31:03] would have never known that I was dying
[1:31:06] I had heard the story since a boy
[1:31:10] and I thought I was fine but it took the
[1:31:13] second Adam
[1:31:14] it took the second Adam coming to me to
[1:31:18] say I love you but you're you're not
[1:31:20] alive yet you're still dying you're
[1:31:23] you're born in sin and you're gone it
[1:31:25] doesn't matter how good you are or how
[1:31:27] good you think you are how many Good
[1:31:28] Deeds you can perform
[1:31:30] you need to let me come in
[1:31:34] you need to let me come in and take out
[1:31:36] your old sinful life and replace your
[1:31:39] life with my life I've never been so
[1:31:41] happy friends to raise up my hands and
[1:31:43] surrender and say yay Lord come in and
[1:31:45] take the old me take it all take
[1:31:48] everything of me away I I want to be
[1:31:51] like you I want to be in heaven I want
[1:31:53] to have that home I want to have that
[1:31:54] Lord I Lord I I desire Purity I desire
[1:31:57] Holiness I'm searching for truth I'm
[1:32:00] searching for purpose
[1:32:03] and I found it today and you can find it
[1:32:06] too friends you can find it right where
[1:32:08] you're sitting right now you can find
[1:32:10] and say Lord God maybe maybe you've
[1:32:13] never known him in that way maybe you've
[1:32:14] been born and raised in the truth but
[1:32:16] you sit here today and this preaching
[1:32:18] has led you to say to yourself I need
[1:32:20] more I need more of God I need more of
[1:32:23] something in my life Hallelujah you want
[1:32:25] to raise your hand up to God and admit
[1:32:27] that today and say master of all life
[1:32:30] come into my life and resurrect me to
[1:32:33] the newness of life that your word
[1:32:35] promises that's what will prove
[1:32:38] that you have passed from Death unto
[1:32:40] life when you're in complete nature your
[1:32:44] old Fallen nature that was so
[1:32:46] comfortable in the world is no longer
[1:32:49] comfortable there and you've been given
[1:32:51] a new nature you've been completely made
[1:32:54] as Paul would say a new creation as
[1:32:57] brother Brandon would say a brand new
[1:32:59] unit
[1:33:02] if I call up Chris and say Chris
[1:33:04] my AC's could put
[1:33:07] uh I need a I need a brand new unit

[1:33:12] mean come and rebuild it

[1:33:25] getting a brand new unit I don't just
[1:33:27] want to be repaired I'm not looking for
[1:33:29] a Band-Aid I don't need an adjustment I
[1:33:32] need it to be brand new
[1:33:34] Hallelujah I need a GPS
[1:33:38] believe that today oh let's stand up all
[1:33:41] over the building friends brand new you
[1:33:43] can be brand new
[1:33:46] you don't have to you might have come in
[1:33:48] here as one person you can leave as a
[1:33:50] completely different one you can have
[1:33:52] God moving in your life in a way that
[1:33:56] you never dreamed possible
[1:33:59] that's absolutely how God moves that's
[1:34:01] that's the the realities of the future
[1:34:03] hidden Mana did you know that the future
[1:34:05] hidden Mana
[1:34:08] it's that it's the eternal
[1:34:11] unfolding of Christ
[1:34:14] in the Eternal ages to come that's what
[1:34:16] the Book of Revelation means when it
[1:34:18] talks about the hidden manner
[1:34:21] and and the prophet said sometimes
[1:34:24] we get a little taste of the word of God
[1:34:27] or you know the movement of the Lord in
[1:34:30] our lives are we coming to a church
[1:34:31] service like this and we think it's so
[1:34:34] wonderful
[1:34:36] and brother Brandon and it is he's not
[1:34:38] saying it's not
[1:34:39] a the
[1:34:41] um a crumb of this is wonderful
[1:34:43] so he's not saying it's not wonderful
[1:34:45] he's just simply saying however
[1:34:47] someday
[1:34:48] you think this is good
[1:34:50] someday he in that word will become what
[1:34:54] you never dreamed possible
[1:34:58] but you never
[1:35:00] dreamed possible
[1:35:02] oh
[1:35:04] I don't know friends
[1:35:06] I can imagine quite a bit
[1:35:08] and the Lord is saying you've never
[1:35:10] imagined this
[1:35:12] it's never entered into the heart of man
[1:35:14] what God has in store for them that
[1:35:18] loving
[1:35:19] you might think that you're by your
[1:35:20] heads with me all over the building
[1:35:25] if you might think that you're a good
[1:35:27] person well and well and fine that's
[1:35:29] wonderful I'm glad
[1:35:31] that you have a uh
[1:35:33] that you don't suffer under an
[1:35:36] inferiority complex you think I'm a good
[1:35:38] person I do good things praise God God
[1:35:40] bless you keep doing them those are
[1:35:42] wonderful
[1:35:43] that's how you won't lose your reward uh
[1:35:46] the reap you reap what you sow if you if
[1:35:49] you sow Good Deeds God will cause Good
[1:35:51] Deeds to come your way if you sow the
[1:35:52] good word of God that'll grow a crop in
[1:35:54] your life don't you worry you bring a
[1:35:57] cup of cold water to one of God's family
[1:35:59] and Jesus said you'll never lose your
[1:36:02] reward for that in this life or the life
[1:36:04] to come
[1:36:05] so it's awful it's wonderful that you
[1:36:07] have good deeds and you feel like a good
[1:36:10] person
[1:36:12] but don't make the mistake that Eve made
[1:36:15] thinking she was okay
[1:36:18] and a good person
[1:36:19] when actually she stood in Peril of her
[1:36:23] life
[1:36:24] and it took Adam to open her eyes and
[1:36:28] then they knew they were naked
[1:36:33] maybe the second Adam is standing near
[1:36:36] you right now
[1:36:37] all heads bowed please all over the
[1:36:39] building I don't want anyone looking
[1:36:40] around
[1:36:41] [Music]
[1:36:43] maybe the second Adam is standing near
[1:36:45] you right now saying you are a good
[1:36:48] person that's fine but you're gonna need
[1:36:51] to be more than good you're going to
[1:36:53] need to be me
[1:36:55] that's the message of the Gospel
[1:36:58] you're going to need to be more than a
[1:36:59] church goer you're going to need more
