amen thank you [Music] Lord amen a confession like that that's the work of God in a person's heart the the human nature doesn't want to surrender to the word of God it human nature that we're born with Rebels against the word of God Amen but that's the Holy Spirit moving moving in our hearts I I trust that each one Sayang that with a A True Confession from their lips that they say we're holding nothing back truly whatever it takes and it's going to take a lot he promised he promised that we'll be transforming power he also promised there will be troubles and trials and difficulties and they're going to challenge our faith but he's going to deliver us out of out of or through every one of them amen so we're so thankful for that and um want to it's been a while since I've given a missions report I have three uh trips that I've done since the last time I've uh spoken about the missions trip so we're going to do that tonight and if there's time at the end though I doubt there will be we'll have a short message so let's start by turning to the scriptures we're going to look at Revelation chapter 10 just read one verse there verse 11 and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and Nations and tongues and kings amen this is the this is the calling and the commission to the bride of Christ amen at the end time it means there's a great necessity Amen to take this seven seal mystery that's been revealed take it to the Nations amen amen uh Psalm 19 and look at verse four I always love this verse because Paul quotes it in the New Testament in uh Romans chapter 10 and he says this is the the preaching of the word has gone out into all the world I always am stand amazed at the revelation of that because if you read psalms 19 it's saying the heavens declare the glory of God and the firmament showeth his handiwork so I guess instead of the heavens declaring the gospel he's put it into human flesh amen that we would take the word and that it would go into all the Earth their line is gone out through all the Earth and their words to the end of the world in them hath he set a tabernacle to the for the sun let's pray father we just come before you now Lord and we're so thankful for your mercy and Grace To Us Lord we we're so thankful that you've chosen to reveal yourself to us Lord this wasn't what we were looking for this wasn't what we were seeking after Lord but you you sought after us you came to us you called us Lord and you if we can really catch the revelation we understand that you yourself have come to teach us amen and reveal yourself to us in this hour Lord to write your word in our heart and in our mind and it wouldn't be like the old Covenant where every man would teach his neighbor but rather we would be taught by you Lord we pray that this secret place Lord that's been made available for us to enter into would become more and more real to us Lord we commit this time with you into your hands Lord For Your Glory we think of those who are not feeling well and all the different things that have been been going around Lord we just rebuke the devil in the name of Jesus Christ and we ask for healing and strengthening to everyone under the sound of the voice Lord we look to you commit ourselves to you in Jesus name amen God bless you you could be seated maybe Doug and Chassidy were welcomed on Sunday but we'll welcome him again amen you were sick my goodness so much sickness going around well glad you're here so three missions trips since August I was going to give a missions trip before but Tony uh and and the worship team did such a wonderful job I came to the pulpit the an the anointing struck me and I all I could do was preach I couldn't said I can't waste this anointing here that's come on this but I felt the same way coming again today such so appreciative of all the specials and songs and the anointing that yall bring into the service as well um I do want to preach but I'm going to just let let the preaching come in the form of a testimony amen so three missions trips different different kind of year as everybody knows I'm usually uh thank you a middle eastern missionary and for some reason last October of 2023 the Lord dealt with my heart to um accept accept some other invitations to other places and of course Honduras brother Matt and I went and then also uh in zomia brother Mulo Chanda um is a pastor there in luaka wonderful brother I've been contact with him I um I I met him through my podcast and we've been in touch ever since probably I think maybe a couple years before or a year before um probably a year before I moved here so it's been it's been a while and he's been after me for a long time to come visit and was interesting to see the Israel flag there in luaka Zombie as we're driving down the road and uh it it's to me I was expect it was my first time to sub Sahara Africa so I was really uh expecting try hard trials and difficulties in the um bathroom situation and food situations and and uh uh I stayed in the Rison blue so I was [Laughter] blessed no no problem and their infrastructure is is quite good in the in the big city of luaka there um this is Brother mul's Church there we had uh six services in his church in in three days and uh Lord really moved I I had on my heart to speak on um a word family to them and uh you know Africa is such a different culture and the struggles and the difficulties they would have in families would be definitely different from here but we find whatever the what whatever the culture is and the difficulties are the word uh answers answers the issues and uh for them the big thing that stood out was realizing the responsibility that a father has uh towards his daughter for them you have a daughter that's just my wife's responsibility and so I for some reason I didn't even know know what it was but the Lord led me really to spend time and focus on that and uh all the deacons and the ministers were there you got to come all around the country to every one of our churches and preach this to us because we don't we don't we don't ever hear anything like this and we really need it um the other thing I learned while I was there and the other the the other topic I I felt led to speak on was seventh seal Oneness restored and um some of them have come into the the revelation of the opening of the word but there's a huge uh group there that is totally totally blind to that and teaching against that um kind of similar circumstances to what I was dealing with with the Iranians with Ewald Frank doctrine that seventh th seventh seal that's all for the Jews that's not for the Gentiles uh it's a seventh trumpet angel it's nothing to do with brother brandham and so that that teaching had gone in and I I uh I didn't really know that I just felt led to preach on it and then we had a ministers meeting afterwards you can see more of the church uh there and uh just wonderful the Lord really moved in the Services Group of Believers there in uh luaka and then we had a u afternoon uh ministers meeting with the brothers and from all over zomia and uh some of the questions that came up were regarding the seventh seal um fairly innocuous questions really nothing that would lead you to think that there was some false teaching going around and the Lord just lend me down the line to tell my testimony of how the Lord dealt with me and dealt with me uh working with Iranian Believers regarding not having any understanding of the seals or their purpose and uh a few of the brothers that caught the Revelation well had already caught the Revelation um I saw them smiling and putting their head down and almost chuckling a little bit like this is too this is too uh too funny because he's he's blasting directly this one and this one and that one and this one and this one and so they're just like and so I thank the Lord because the you know those brothers were eager to stay in contact and want me to come back back and visit so Lord willing I'll be going back for their annual meetings in um in early July for that but the need is great but I'm only one person so anybody that's listening uh like like I did last year for the camp I'll just pray the Holy Spirit sweeps through the ministers here and convict your heart to get out on the missions field Amen brother Luther so after the I think I was four 4 days in laka we took through the road I think it was a 10hour drive but you know it's African time so you really don't know what that exactly means um I think it took us about 8 hours to get to the first place though the uh Google Maps said it would be uh five so the first place we hit typical thing you'll see there Ox cart down the road people riding along and we had a service in this church we just brother brother Mulo said we got to hurry the church will be waiting for us we showed up not a soul there and so they started playing music and then the village starts filing into the to the church and went and and preached on overcoming depression and uh Lord really moved in a lot of people's lives things they'd never heard before and and uh soon as I finished preaching went off the platform um spent few minutes speaking with the pastor got in the car and we had another I think 7 hours to get down to Livingstone so was a long day and uh the pastor there in uh Muni Village uh next to Livingstone also does some tour guide work so he took me around he took me to the Livingstone Museum so I got to see different uh David Livingstone artifacts there and things about the history of different uh zombiie and tribes and uh also got they took me over to V Victoria Falls which is pictures don't do it justice but it was a incedible experience to go with the brothers got to hang out with the brothers and some baboons so they're not afraid of people and I guess there's no need for us to be afraid of them although they could tear you up pretty good they on that bridge when you're walking across the bridge they would just run as fast as they could right past your head I didn't I didn't put it in here but one of the baboons crossed the bridge and was kind of going in front of us and he found a Fanta bottle that didn't have the cap on and he sat down and put it back to take a swig I was like my goodness these are Advanced baboons here got a little drop of of some sugar and uh took us to a place where they had all kinds of lions at a park there I had they said they asked me if I wanted to go and walk with the Lions and I said this was good enough we stayed on a hotel on the zambesi just up from Victoria Falls and uh got to see a incredible Sunset there now when we're driving and leave at night the statement is watch out for deer right not in Africa it's it's watch out for elephants and I'm like come again watch out for what elephants so if you don't have your high beams on the way the way elephants do is they in order to moisturize their skin they roll around in mud and so they have that mud on there and if you just have your regular Beam on and are going fast the their their their hide just uh doesn't reflect the light so you don't see them so you have to have your high beams on and kind of drive drive slower that was a pretty neat experience to see him this was just come kind of coming in and out of where our hotel uh was located I don't know what that is let me look on on here and see might be a video or not so this was the little church in mukan Village it was a uh very very interesting experience with them I spoke on the seventh Seal family and uh the pastor was so enthusiastic and I guess they're I was confused because I would say like a sentence and he would talk for two or three minutes and he's running around the church screaming and jumping I turned around and looked at brother Mulo I said what's he doing is he interpreting what I'm saying he's like like yeah he said their their dialect is it's it's like every word you say there's an explanation it's not just the husband is the head of the wife they don't have this word there's a there's a whole sentence that goes for that word head like my goodness forget what I'm preaching on by the time he's done this little guy uh was the pastor's son and uh he came up to me after service and and he said uh when are you leaving I said tomorrow I have to be at the airport tomorrow around noon and he said okay when I'm done with school you come pick me I was like I don't know buddy I I'm so sorry I don't think I don't think I can do it no no you come pick me I go I go with you no I can't so he came I got in the vehicle he come around and he just looked up at me with the big eye big eyes and when school is done you come pick me like I don't think it's going to work but I'm almost convinced so just uh tremendous experience this this pastor his uh uncle is the chief of their Village and if you're not familiar uh you know they they they have their elected government there but then they also have Chiefs and those Chiefs are in control of I mean unbelievable vast territories they they control the land and so he was saying now I I want you to come back and meet the chief and he'll give you some land and you can develop it he's like as many hectars as you want and I'm like that's not that's not my business I don't i' be glad to meet the chief but I don't need any land don't get any ideas about going with me but just just tremendous for for me after going to the Middle East for so long and dealing with a little bit tough people to deal with going to uh Zombia was like the one of the biggest breath of fresh air for me that I've ever experienced um totally just fell in love with all the people there and I can't not go back the now the whole time I told the brother the pastor make sure that this pastor in mukan Village uh books me on a Safari I can't there's no possibility I can go to Africa and not at least drive around and see some animals oh yeah yeah yeah yeah they'll do that they'll do that day whole day goes by it's like are we doing that next we doing that next we're doing that next oh yeah yeah yeah where are we going now back to the hotel okay so I went to the hotel and spoke with them and the next morning at like 6:00 a.m. they had a time for us to go so I could do it before um getting on to the the plane to head to South Africa so got to see hippos and zebra they don't they in this particular Park they don't have any uh Predators so if Predators come in they they uh trap them or whatever they do probably uh tranquilize them and take them out on the other side of the fence um they do come in because they can cross the river but the rest of it is kind of fenced off so this was a interesting experience uh the the drivers were taking us around and showing us different things they said do you want to do a rhino walk and I was like yeah yeah absolutely so you get to the Rhino and the Rhino are actually guarded by people 24/7 365 there's never not a time because people poachers come and saw off their their um horn and it's used for medicine in China so they the the the guy asked us do you know what these who these guns are for and I was like uh I don't know the Rhinos they're like oh no these wouldn't touch a rhino these are for the poachers and so they're there um and so when you go they they put one of the um gay morens walking with you so we're walking and we go and finally as we get back to the vehicle after the walk brother Mulo says hey do I know you to this this this fell and he's like yeah we know each other you're this person you're this person and here here it was a message believer that's a preacher that goes around the country as a game Arden so I got his contact in information we've been in touch ever since I always have him send me some photos or something from something that he's doing so he goes all around this affords him because they do like few days on a few days off so it affords them time to preach in different areas and so that was a neat experience then we forward to November um went to uh Cambodia this is Pham pen is where we flew into so it was quite an adventure um I've never gone that direction before so uh 12 hours difference and uh and it's it's a long flight from Atlanta to to Korea and then uh it's another like 5 and 1 half 6 hour flight from um soul to pen we we uh we got into the airport late and brother Brent who was traveling with or I was traveling with him um from Brother Eugene's Church his uh luggage didn't come so we were we got to the hotel at like 2:00 a.m. and didn't get to bed till 3:00 a.m. and the brother brother Paul said that picked us up said um we got to leave at 6:00 a.m. for uh the next town that we're going to I was like okay how long's the drive he's like 12 hours ah okay so very little sleep and and and lots of time and this was the bus that they put us on with about 20 Filipinos and there was no business that 20 people should have been on this in this van and the seats were definitely made for little people what what what I found with cambodians and Vietnamese and uh Lao um their men are about the size of Avery and Mina uh no joke and little and their their women are like just a little bit bigger than Addie so they're just tiny so they fit in these seats uh they gave two seats to Brent and I and neither of us were barely on the seat and I was already suffering in pain so about halfway through I said I can't I can't go on this hurts too much I I I can't do it so the somebody came and picked me up then I could be in a vehicle for the last uh four or five hours but it was this was a soft form of torture I would have told you anything that you wanted to know to get out of it brother Paul uh there from from pen uh he's he's doing missions work all through southeast Asia he's doing missions work uh with Vietnamese people with Laos he's he's Cambodian but he's he's um also speaks Le oian so he's been doing translation work into uh Le ocean and doing Outreach so this has been kind of a a very New Missions work in the last uh seven seven or eight years Co really slowed things down but I think the last meeting that brother Brent went to um was 2019 and they had about 20 people there for the meetings just a just a just a start really for the missions work but this time um Brother Paul's been working hard and traveling a lot through the country and in contact with people uh in Vietnam denominational Christians leading them to the message and so he's been doing a great job I think every meal is f breakfast is f lunch is f dinner is f which I like so it was good and you see that little tiny dish on the left that was our that was the meal and that's why I found out there're so little is cuz their dishes are like that I had to eat you know about four or five of them to make for what American normally eats but it's good food Buddhist Buddhist monk crossing the street see that quite a bit in in this particular um in Cambodia to have a have a meeting the way that we had with so many people there you got to get the agreement of the Christian Bishop the uh Buddhist manager and the police on our way the Buddhist um manager backed out and said you can't have your meetings so we're like four hours out after all this misery and we can't have the meetings I just said brother Paul we're going to pray there's no way that the Lord sent me through all this to get here to have it canceled so don't worry about it we're going to pray and we'll rebuke the devil and meetings will be fine tomorrow and they and they were um I think it took about $100 to pay the Buddhist uh manager but the Lord made his the Lord made his heart willing and I think about uh 25 R 25 uh Filipino Saints came with to support the meetings uh brother Nestor and some other ministers uh came as well really blessing to get to know them and fellowship with them brother brother Paul there was three services a day for four days and brother Paul translated every single one of them have no idea how he still had a voice at the end oh and yeah but did I mention Cambodia is hot very hot but it was open they had fans going and the breeze was coming through so that really did take some of it off but very hot very humid that's the all the ministers that were there from the Philippines um from uh Cambodia from Laos and from Vietnam so Vietnam there's really not a a good possibility for anyone to go there and openly hold meetings um the way that they it's a Communist Regime and they're not at all open to any of that some brothers over over time you may have heard different testimonies going there and a number of Believers from Europe from um new Zealand from Australia have been arrested or almost arrested in um in Vietnam so it was a great blessing these brothers could come over I think the Border was just 15 or 20 minutes away from where we held the meetings there in Northeast Cambodia um so from there and also I think there was uh three or four brothers from La they got me a 2XL shirt Cambodia sizes are very different I think I need to lose another 200 PBS in order to get in that one get down to about 70 pounds and I'll fit it that was the picture of all everybody there was at the meeting so quite a quite a growth of the message there in that area in the last five or six years much to do so so remember brother Paul in prayer he's he's a busy man and uh could use definitely could use some more support and could use so the Holy Spirit to sweep through your hearts and send you to Cambodia because there's really isn't a lot of brothers doing missions work in this part of Southeast Asia so morbid picture but this is uh uh the called The Killing Fields Cambodia back in the 70s and 80s P pot um brought brought the um more upper class middle class people uh into these um areas that were like uh cordoned off and hidden off and did a lot of tricks to hide what was happening but they just they didn't use bullets or or knives or anything they just used farm implements to murder millions of people um at this particular place it was hundreds of thousands when it sometimes when it's heavy rains there's still bones coming up out of the mud and and dirt that they're finding and it's h it was it's horrific what the people there went through so went to the you can go into the palace area there not into the palace but the grounds of the palace and see that so I had a couple hours before my flight so I had to to see something right wonderful time I just enjoyed the fellowship for our breakfasts and our dinners with the Philip Filipino Saints um just really really precious I have to I have to be careful because I'm going to want to go to the Philippines really bad after meeting them but there's a lot of work to do in the Middle East so then a very unexpected trip to Uganda um earlier in the year I had a conversation with brother Abraham and he he said uh I had mentioned wanting to get get to Uganda and was kind of asking him about some of the different invitations that I had from different people and he said well why don't you come visit me and I said oh well when he's like oh the year's taken up but I don't know maybe the end of the year we have meetings at at at at New Year's maybe that'll work for you and I said maybe we can talk later and for for him that was you're coming I'll give you the details later for me that was we'll talk later so December 15th here's the details uh I'm not coming says brother it's devastating we we we have we have 10 services and I have one Minister I need I need someone else to come and it'll be impossible to find someone I could preach but the people are wanting you know some visitors to come they hear me preach all the time oh brother I I thought you I thought you were coming and uh you know I've heard that heard things like this before and just said I'm not coming but something convicted me this time and the Lord was working working beforehand and ended up surrendering to the call to go to Uganda last minute right after Christmas and uh was an incredible uh experience to be able to go to Uganda see um beautiful people there and The beautiful landscape there um brother Tony let me borrow his his drone so I could get some different shots in the area and that's brother Abraham's Church there they're adding on to it it's a it's a work in progress um so keep them in prayer but um there was about I would say there's about 700 7 or 800 people that were at the meeting they kind of have them in different areas uh sitting we had 10 Services on Two on Sunday three Monday three Tuesday two on Wednesday and then we had to get after service we had to eat get in the car and go back to kalala it's quite a whirl whirlwind trip but amazing experience just preaching to the Saints there um how they pull on the word and their their hearts are just always the Lord the Lord deals with him and it's amazing to see him come forward and and pray and pour their hearts hearts out to the Lord after every after every message um that's outside of brother Abraham's house I don't know if you've heard the testimony but um a group of Believers in Europe went together and built him this this house his house before I don't know if you could see it on this picture yeah just to the left of the church was his house where he lived before so that is just a about a block um that direction um or this direction if you're looking at that one is where his house is and um they they built it for him it's it's a nice house for hosting people and it was uh great blessing to him every me every meal three meals a day with myself and brother Abraham and brother Burley please don't be jealous about the fellowship I had with these brothers but it that that was for me that was as much of a blessing as every part of it um brother Abraham every night starts playing his guitar the family gathers around they they sing and uh read the scripture and he preaches for 15 20 minutes and everybody prays together and then I was just finally getting deep sleep and about 5:00 a.m. the guitar starts strumming and I was like do I have to go service services in a few hours and I barely slept I went and shut the door went to sleep but it was such a inspiration to me to see that and how he does that and how faithful to that I asked the kids oh uh you you guys always do that evening and morning he's like for 30 years so it's amazing got a got a um some pretty neat footage from the Drone I wish I could put it in here but just uh was a tremendous experience for me spending time with brother Abraham and seeing his church and seeing Uganda meeting the people was is uh very very blessed um I can't believe it but I have 15 minutes to preach so I'm going to bring up my notes and we'll go to that um with that said I do have a missions trip coming up to Egypt I'll be going for two weeks uh leave on the 27th and we'll be there until the uh 10th of February so please remember me in prayer and that work in prayer the the open doors amongst the Pentecostal churches that I went to uh last March is is still open and Lord willing I'm trying to there's they have 70 churches that they've opened the door to me too Lord willing I think we're doing 15 churches this time so just do the math we'll try to get through that God willing in 2025 if if if it's his plan for us so let's turn in the scripture to Revelation 10 verse 8 and the voice which I I heard from Heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth as sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and Nations and tongues and kings and so we notice then that we John being a type of the Bride that we have to take of course thises and symbols we understand it's not a literal book that we take and eat but it is taking the revelation of the word and spiritually assimilating that not just in our brains but at the depth of our very soul and so it's it's feeding on that word so that Revelation upon Revelation upon Revelation is added to to to our soul to bring us to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ and so then out of that it's not it's not enough to just do that because there's a next step to that and the next step to that is the word that you've assimilated must come out of your lips it's not enough to talk about your inheritance you you have to speak what your inheritance has given you the the word that we've been delivered is not all not only a revelation that gives us knowledge that's fantastic that has to start that way but it's not supposed to finish that way number one is it's going to produce a certain kind of life number two it's going to produce a certain kind of word coming forth from our lips and that that is a great portion of the third pole in the seventh seal I think you can bring up can you bring up that uh PowerPoint again at the very end there's some quotes I'm just going to start reading if you can get it I think it's just towards the end right after that um Sunset picture has been 7even years years ago said don't try to explain that said this is the third pool but I'll meet you in there that right I was standing with a little baby shoe when he told me said now make your first pull and when you do the fish will run after the lure said then watch your second pull said because it'll only be small fish he said then the third poll we will get we will we'll get it and all the ministers got around me said brother brandham we know you can do it Hallelujah brother brandham that's where how he's got tied up with a bunch of preachers see I love people they want you to explain everything this and that I said well uh uh uh said I don't know said I've understand fishing now I said now the first thing you do here's the way it's done you see all the fish around you got the jerk The Lure well that's exactly the tactics of fishing so I said jerk The Lure now you see when I jerk The Lure first time now the fish takes it out after it but they they were little ones and that's just like they were catching so then I said then then you'll set and I jerked it out on the bank and I had a fish but it looked like a skin Over The Lure it was just was so little and I was standing there and something said I told you not to do that I started crying all the line was Tangled around me like this I was standing there crying with my head down like that I said God oh forgive me I'm a stupid person Lord please forgive me and I had this line and then and that when I had in my hand was a little baby shoe about that long and I had the string was about as big as around as my finger about half an inch like and the eyelid in the shoe this shoe was just about the size 1116 probably of an inch in the eyelet and I was trying to lace this little shoe up this great big inch cord and a voice come and says now you can't teach Pentecostal babies Supernatural things said now let them alone and just then he picked he picked me up he he took me up and sit me way up high to where a meeting was going on looked like a tent or a cathedral or some sort and I looked and there was a little box like little place over in the side and I seen the that light was talking to somebody above me that light that you see there on the picture it Whirled away from me like that and went over that tent and said I'll meet you there said this will be the third poll and you won't tell it to nobody and in sepino Canyon he said this is the third pole and there's three great things that goes with it now he's going back to the seals he's telling his testimony he's talking about the vision and he's telling us the little room the tent in other in other ones it says that light left me and went down to that little room and the people went in that little room and they come out totally he what happened I don't know I can't explain brother brandham says in sepino can Sabino Canyon he told me this is the third pool now he's going to go back and bring this back into the seventh seal that he's preaching on and he says and there's three things that goes with it and one unfolded today or yesterday the the other one folded today and there's one thing that I cannot interpret because it's in an unknown language but I stand right there looks right straight at it and this is the third pull coming up and the Holy Spirit of God oh my so there I'll bring that there so if we begin to look at this and and understand what he's speaking about there in in simplicity not thinking trying to explain every single detail but if we understand there's a change that takes place under the third pole by going into a secret place and the angel pointed out to brother brandham and said when you pray go into the secret place and ask your father heavenly father in secret and he'll reward you openly so going in there and that Pillar of Fire meeting the people in there not knowing what happened but coming out totally changed and transformed and this is the third poll what is the third poll it's the opening of the word brother brandham says says this on a number of occasions and a number of different ways through 63 64 and 65 third poll is the opening of the word so when we realize these symbols that are bringing forth are symbols that are connected to uh scriptural event that's taking place and of course we understand when the seven Thunders utter their voices they're not bringing a new revelation they're bringing biblical truth to the Forefront once again they're taking the things that were left off through the reformers Gathering those Revelations together and making it presenting it openly to the bride in other words it's the fullness of the New Covenant totally restored back to us and so it's going to take that those seven Thunders which the prophet says that the the the seven Thunder Mysteries is what will restore the church back to the original faith and it's something that is not written and yet it's a scriptural Revelation it's from Genesis to revelation God making known the Mysteries to his people brother bam says in the seventh seal he says don't try to interpret the things don't try to do anything more than just live a close Life Giving praise and honor to Jesus Christ don't interpret it turn with me to John chapter 6 and verse 44 four I'm going to have to go fast cuz I have to be done no man can come to me except the Father which has sent me draw draw him and I will raise him up at the last day amen so it's a sovereign work of God he is the one that does the drawing it's not us that does the choosing it's him that does the choosing it's not it's not us that we sought God but it's rather that God went out and sought us and Drew us to the reality of the revelation of Jesus Christ verse 45 it is written in the prophets and they shall be all taught of God every man therefore that hath heard and ha learned of the father cometh unto me not that any man has seen the father say save he which is of god he has seen the father my goodness so the purpose of Christ and why he came was so that all the children of God would be taught of God this goes right back to the New Covenant we'll read it in in a minute so we're not to interpret the things ourselves we live a Godly Christian Life and God will teach it to you amen he says it's not to be known to the public he said he says I got in trouble before and I messed things up and I Tangled myself up in all this line because I tried to explain the details to everybody he says I'll take it to my grave there's three things one unfolded he said under the Sixth Seal it's the SE the coming of the son of of man the Angels wouldn't know anything about it but it's the coming of the son of man this the second part will be the seven Thunder mystery right and the third part came in an unknown language and I couldn't make it out and I'll I won't interpret it and I'll take it to my grave so it won't be known to the public don't interpret it but live a Godly Christian Life don't be a fanatic amen I I think we can all see the great prophetic voice that was in those utterances that came off because what have people done they've been a fanatic they tried to bring their own interpretation of everything instead of let letting brother brandham interpret his own words which he does read Christ as the mystery of God revealed and you'll find out the secret what is the secret Daniel 12 I'm just going to go very fast Daniel this is 4 through1 if you want to write it down but Daniel Comes he sees a vision he's told Daniel shut up the words and seal the book even to the time of the the end then he goes forward and he says I heard but I understood not what what what will will the end of these things be my Lord go your way Daniel the words are SE are closed up and sealed till the time of the end so what is the sealing it's a sealed away from the understanding amen the revelation of the word to our hearts was sealed off but then it says many will be purified and made white and tried but the wicked shall do wickedly and none of the wicked shall understand but the wise shall understand so this mysterious book that's sealed up is going to be broken open and it's going to be revealed to the hearts of the wise in seventh seal brother bam says the end time seal when it starts will be absolutely a total secret according to the Bible before knowing that and remember Revelation 10 1-7 chapter 10 1:7 at the end of the seventh Angel's message all the mysteries of God will be known so it starts out as a secret but it doesn't finish that way it finishes as as a revelation of the word to the bride last one Hebrews 8 musicians if you want to come Hebrews 8 8-13 for finding fault with them he saith behold the days come sayith the Lord when I will make a New Covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah not according to the Covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt because they continued not in my Covenant and I regarded them not sayi the Lord for this is the Covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days sayeth the Lord listen I will put my laws into their mind and write them in their hearts and I will be to them a God and they shall be to me a people and they shall not teach every man his neighbor it'll be in an unknown language they'll not teach every man his neighbor and every man his brother saying know the Lord For All Shall know me from the least to the greatest for I will be merciful to their unrighteousness and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more in that he saith a New Covenant he hath made the first old now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away so it's the the fullness of the New Covenant which is what Christ revealed in the fullness in his bride the Oneness of Christ and his bride the the bride has a secret she has the word she she is one with the word she's taken the book she's eaten it and she's prophesying again that's where the transforming power that's where the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ comes from is from the revelation of the word that's the New Covenant that's the teacher he's in you revealing the hidden secrets amen let's stand Heavenly Father we're so thankful Lord for your mercy and your grace to us Lord we're so thankful for the revelation of the word in this hour Lord truly it's the it's a new language Lord that's revealed just to the heart of the Bride not known to the public Lord but it's a it's a secret relationship the Oneness of Christ The Living Word and his bride she she is him she is him on display Lord let us become the word more and more Lord give us one desire and one passion in this life Lord and that's to
