[0:00] [Music]
[0:51] I am the clay.
[0:56] [Music]
[1:00] Mold me
[1:02] and make
[1:06] me
[1:09] after
[1:11] thy will.
[1:17] While I am waiting,
[1:22] [Music]
[1:26] yielded
[1:28] and still. Could you just stand? Would
[1:31] you just sing that with all of our
[1:32] heart?
[1:34] Oh, have thy
[1:37] own way,
[1:41] Lord.
[1:44] have thy
[1:46] own way.
[1:53] Thou are the father
[2:01] and I am
[2:04] the clay.
[2:11] Hold me
[2:14] and make
[2:17] me
[2:20] after
[2:22] thy will
[2:29] while I
[2:32] wait.
[2:38] healing
[2:40] and still.
[2:43] Would
[2:43] &gt;&gt; you just turn with me in your Bibles to
[2:46] the book of Psalms,
[2:48] Psalms 33,
[2:51] is going to read verses 1-9.
[2:54] It says, "Rejoice in the Lord, oh ye
[2:57] righteous, for praise is comely for the
[3:01] upright. Praise the Lord with harp. Sing
[3:05] unto him with the sultry and an
[3:07] instrument of 10 strings. Sing unto him
[3:10] a new song. Play skillfully with a loud
[3:15] noise. For the Lord
[3:18] for the word of the Lord is right, and
[3:20] all his works are done in truth. He
[3:24] loveth righteousness and judgment, and
[3:27] the earth is full of the goodness of the
[3:30] Lord. Aren't you glad for that? Amen.
[3:34] By the word of the Lord were the heavens
[3:36] made and all the host of them by the
[3:39] breath of his mouth. To this day that
[3:42] still shocks me that he just spoke,
[3:45] right? And he created everything. Think
[3:48] about that. He gatherth the waters of
[3:51] the sea together as a heap. He layeth up
[3:54] the depth in storehouses.
[3:57] Let all the earth fear the Lord. Let all
[4:00] the inhabitants of the world stand in
[4:03] all of him. For he spake and it was
[4:06] done. He commanded and it stood fast.
[4:11] Let's just bow our heads, have a word of
[4:13] prayer. Almighty God, it's always a
[4:16] privilege and an honor, Lord, to be able
[4:18] to come before your throne,
[4:21] Lord. Yet another service, Lord. Another
[4:23] Wednesday night. We're here in your
[4:25] house bringing our vocal cords, Lord,
[4:29] and our hearts and our Lord, our songs
[4:32] of praise unto you to sing of the
[4:35] goodness of God to speak of our great
[4:39] King, the lover of our souls and the
[4:42] giver of life.
[4:44] Thank you, dear God, for all that you do
[4:46] for us, Lord. Wednesdays. Sometimes we
[4:49] come in here and we're a little tired,
[4:52] Lord, and the devil plays with our mind
[4:55] and sometimes it's hard to focus, Lord,
[4:58] and just get ourselves out of the way. I
[5:01] pray tonight, Lord, is a special night.
[5:04] Lord, may it be a special Wednesday
[5:06] night, Lord. May you just touch our
[5:08] hearts, Lord. Help us to be open to
[5:12] receive whatever you have in store for
[5:14] us, Lord. And may the desires of our
[5:17] heart be to leave better people tonight
[5:21] as we hear your words. May it sink down
[5:24] into the depths of our heart, the depths
[5:26] of our soul. In that wonderful name of
[5:29] Jesus Christ, the congregation says,
[5:33] "Amen.
[5:36] Have thy
[5:38] own way, Lord."
[5:42] Oh yes.
[5:44] will have thy
[5:48] own way,
[5:51] Lord.
[5:54] Oh, have thy
[5:57] own.
[6:03] I
[6:06] the potter
[6:11] and I am the clay.
[6:17] [Music]
[6:20] Oh, mold me
[6:23] and make
[6:26] me.
[6:29] after
[6:32] thy will
[6:38] while I am waiting,
[6:46] yielding
[6:49] and still.
[6:54] Can we give the Lord a hand clap of
[6:56] praise tonight?
[6:59] Amen. Brother Luther, why don't you come
[7:01] on up and we'll just pray over the
[7:02] tithes and the offerings first.
[7:06] Amen. Are you under expectation tonight
[7:08] to hear from the supernatural?
[7:11] Amen. If you're not, then change your
[7:13] mind because you can be. Come on up,
[7:16] brother.
[7:19] [Music]
[7:26] Let's pray.
[7:29] Father, we come here before you, Father,
[7:31] in the name of Jesus Christ,
[7:33] thanking you for hearing, Lord, when we
[7:36] request prayers for our loved ones, our
[7:39] brothers and our sisters, the
[7:41] testimonies that come forth of what
[7:43] you're doing for them, Lord.
[7:46] Father, and it's not one man standing
[7:48] here, Father, but it's a it's a whole
[7:50] body looking to you this evening. As we
[7:53] collect the tithes and offerings, I pray
[7:55] that you bless the cheerful giver.
[7:56] Father, remember those that are
[7:58] streaming this evening.
[8:01] Let your presence be felt. Father,
[8:04] touch us and strengthen us in your word.
[8:09] We thank you for this opportunity this
[8:11] evening, Lord.
[8:13] There's nothing like going to the house
[8:15] of God. Bless us today, we pray, and may
[8:18] our worship be acceptable in your sight.
[8:20] In Jesus name we pray. Amen.
[8:24] Amen.
[8:28] Amen.
[8:30] [Music]
[8:34] Aren't you glad that when he reached
[8:35] down his hand for you? Amen.
[8:39] I if you have the words for that.
[8:43] I think I know by heart. I always get
[8:46] nervous when I get up here.
[8:49] Once my soul
[8:53] was array
[8:55] from that heavenly
[8:59] way.
[9:02] I was wretched
[9:05] and vile
[9:07] as could be.
[9:16] &gt;&gt; You're above
[9:19] gave me peace,
[9:22] joy, and love
[9:25] when he reached
[9:28] down his hand
[9:31] for me.
[9:37] when he reached
[9:39] down his hand
[9:43] for me.
[9:46] [Music]
[9:49] And he reached
[9:51] way down
[9:53] [Music]
[9:55] for me.
[10:00] Oh, I was lost
[10:03] when undone
[10:06] without my God.
[10:09] Wore his son
[10:12] when he reached
[10:15] down his hand.
[10:18] for me. Aren't you glad he did that for
[10:20] you?
[10:24] But I was nearing
[10:26] [Music]
[10:27] despair
[10:30] when he came
[10:33] to me there
[10:36] and he showed me
[10:39] that I
[10:42] could be free.
[10:47] Then he lifted
[10:51] my feet,
[10:53] gave me glory
[10:55] [Music]
[10:57] complete
[10:59] when he reached
[11:02] down his hand
[11:05] for me.
[11:08] Sing it with all your heart.
[11:11] When he reached
[11:14] down his hand
[11:16] [Music]
[11:17] for me
[11:23] when he reached
[11:25] his way down
[11:29] for me.
[11:34] I was lost

[11:43] or his son
[11:46] when he reach
[11:49] down his hand
[11:51] [Music]
[11:53] for me.
[11:55] Does your heart rejoice?
[11:57] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[11:58] &gt;&gt; How my heart
[12:01] it does rejoice.
[12:04] Since I made
[12:07] him my choice
[12:10] from the tempest
[12:13] to him
[12:16] by now fleeing
[12:22] now I lean
[12:25] on his arm.
[12:28] Oh, thank you Lord.
[12:33] when he reached
[12:36] down his hand
[12:40] for me.
[12:45] when he reached
[12:48] down his hand
[12:51] for me
[12:57] when he reached
[13:00] way down
[13:03] for me.
[13:06] [Music]
[13:08] I was lost
[13:11] and undone
[13:15] without God
[13:18] or his son.
[13:21] and he reached
[13:23] down his hand
[13:26] for me.
[13:32] Well, since the Lord
[13:36] gave me peace,
[13:39] heavenly joy
[13:42] never cease.
[13:44] [Music]
[13:45] Lord, I give all
[13:48] my life
[13:50] One to three.

[13:59] all my life.
[14:02] Hold my hand.
[14:04] Grant that I may stand with you, Lord.
[14:08] When you reached

[14:14] for me.
[14:16] Can you sing that chorus again?

[14:30] [Music]
[14:32] when he reach
[14:34] way down
[14:38] for me.

[21:59] a couple of specials tonight. You can be
[22:02] seated, Sister Brenda. Come on up.
[22:07] [Music]
[22:23] Consider
[22:28] [Music]
[22:44] the liies.
[22:46] They don't toil
[22:50] nor spin.
[22:53] And there's
[22:56] not a king
[22:58] with more splendor
[23:02] than them.
[23:05] Consider
[23:07] the sparrows.
[23:10] They don't plant
[23:14] nor.
[23:16] But they're fed
[23:19] by the master
[23:23] who watches
[23:26] them grow.
[23:29] And we
[23:32] have a heavenly
[23:35] father
[23:38] above
[23:41] with eyes
[23:43] full of mercy
[23:46] and a heart
[23:49] full of love.
[23:53] He
[23:55] really cares when
[23:58] your head is bowed low.
[24:04] Consider
[24:07] the liies
[24:10] and then you
[24:13] will know.
[24:16] May I
[24:19] introduce you
[24:22] to this friend
[24:25] of mine
[24:28] who hangs
[24:31] out the stars,
[24:33] tells the sun
[24:36] just when to shine.
[24:39] And he kisses
[24:42] the flowers
[24:45] each morning
[24:48] with due.
[24:51] For he's
[24:54] not too busy
[24:57] to care
[25:00] about you.
[25:03] We
[25:06] have a heavenly
[25:09] father
[25:12] above
[25:15] with eyes
[25:18] full of mercy
[25:20] and a heart
[25:23] so full of love.
[25:27] He
[25:29] really cares when
[25:32] your head is
[25:35] bowed low.
[25:38] Consider
[25:41] the liies
[25:44] and then you
[25:47] will know.
[25:50] Consider
[25:53] the liies
[25:56] and then you will
[26:01] Oh,
[26:06] [Music]
[26:10] [Applause]
[26:19] [Music]

[28:28] within no longer can char my soul.
[28:34] For pleasures I find in peace and in
[28:39] mind. Since Jesus has made me whole.

[32:41] you know, we're this Matt McGary." I
[32:44] said, "We're going to um maybe just grab
[32:45] one of them pizzas and take it back. We
[32:47] don't got a" and and that's when I got
[32:49] that McGary stare. I called it. Amen.
[32:51] where he just like went blank like and I
[32:53] realized what that look was was that's
[32:56] not how we operate out of here. Amen.
[32:59] And uh he ate he fed us so much food me
[33:02] and Matt both sore off eating for a
[33:05] week. Amen. Now I haven't kept it. Matt
[33:07] have let me ask for Rachel. Has has he
[33:09] kept it? Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[33:12] Amen. Praise God. I I thought I'm going
[33:14] to come back and I'm going to tell
[33:15] Sister Joy I am a vegetarian
[33:19] beginning today.
[33:21] Amen. I think I probably ate a half a
[33:24] cow while I was out there.
[33:27] And uh if you doubt that, ask Brother
[33:28] Matt. He will back that story up. Amen.
[33:32] Joel chapter 2. Want to continue on um
[33:36] from Sunday. I think they've they titled
[33:39] it. I'm going to change that title a
[33:41] little bit. You know what, Z? I tell you
[33:43] what, honey. I told you part three, but
[33:46] actually I'm going to change Sunday to
[33:47] three. So, let's We'll let dad fix it.
[33:50] Don't We'll fix it in post. Amen.
[33:51] Tonight, it'll actually be part four.
[33:53] Amen. I meant to title that last uh or
[33:56] Sunday before last. Praise God. I sure
[33:58] enjoyed that, Brother Caleb. I got a
[34:00] chance to uh see that service and and uh
[34:03] I was uh I I told Brother Matt, I was
[34:05] listening to it on the plane. I said,
[34:06] "My goodness, this young man's jumping
[34:09] all over the place." I said, "We he he
[34:11] could take our opening night at youth
[34:13] camp with this kind of preaching." Amen.
[34:16] And I haven't got a chance to hear the
[34:17] Sunday school yet, but I've heard it's
[34:18] quite amazing. Amen. So, we're looking
[34:21] forward to that. I enjoy the ministry we
[34:23] have here. I think we got some of the
[34:25] best.
[34:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[34:28] Joel 2:20, Joel chapter 2, and we will
[34:33] um just going to read down a few verses
[34:36] uh beginning at verse 23.
[34:39] We're going to preach a little bit. We
[34:41] got some prayer requests to take up. Be
[34:43] glad then, you children of Zion, and
[34:46] rejoice in the Lord your God.
[34:49] For he hath given you the former rain
[34:51] moderately, and he will cause to come
[34:53] down for you the rain, the former rain,
[34:56] and the latter rain in the first month.
[34:58] And the floors shall be full of wheat,
[35:00] and the fat shall overflow with wine and
[35:03] oil. and I will restore to you the years
[35:07] that the locust hath eaten the
[35:08] cankerworm and the caterpillar and the
[35:10] palm worm my great army which I sent
[35:13] among you. Ye shall eat in plenty and be
[35:16] satisfied and praise the name of the
[35:18] Lord your God that hath dealt wondrously
[35:20] with you and my people shall never be
[35:22] ashamed. And I love this 27th verse. and
[35:27] ye shall know that I am in the midst of
[35:29] Israel and that I am the Lord your God
[35:31] and none else and my people shall never
[35:34] be ashamed. So the only way you're going
[35:36] to know who you are and the Lord is
[35:39] going to be in our midst and you will
[35:40] never have to be uh you know getting
[35:43] left holding the bag. You'll never be
[35:45] ashamed. You'll you'll have the Lord's
[35:48] presence and there will be a a complete
[35:52] unveiling of the mighty God all at the
[35:54] end time when the former and latter rain
[35:57] comes together in the same month and the
[35:59] baptism of the Holy Ghost is a fresh
[36:01] surge at the end time. Amen friends. So
[36:04] anybody you know who wouldn't want to
[36:06] have a Holy Ghost baptism like Peter
[36:09] referred to here, I can't imagine why
[36:11] you'd want that gone because that's what
[36:14] identifies the presence of God. the
[36:16] ministry of the son of man. You know why
[36:17] that's true? Because that's what it
[36:19] identified in Acts two.
[36:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:22] &gt;&gt; It identified the presence of the son of
[36:24] man. It identified that ministry in the
[36:26] church. Amen. Which is the word made
[36:29] flesh. Let's pray. Father, we thank you
[36:32] for your word now. And I ask for your
[36:34] blessing as we venture forth. Lord, give
[36:38] us hearing hearts tonight to hear your
[36:40] word. We commit it to you in Jesus name.
[36:42] Amen. God bless. You can be seated.
[37:02] So, we were
[37:05] covering the last time and I just want
[37:06] to make one or two quick points from two
[37:09] Sundays ago.
[37:11] We found that
[37:13] when brother Brandham talks about this
[37:16] day the scriptures fulfilled and he
[37:19] references now Luke chapter 4 and and
[37:23] and we find that's where of course Jesus
[37:25] is is taking the scrolls and saying you
[37:29] know and he's reading from Isaiah's
[37:31] prophecy uh the Lord God um the spirit
[37:34] of the Lord is upon me because he hath
[37:36] anointed me to preach the gospel to the
[37:37] poor goes on down bind up the
[37:39] brokenhearted deliverance to the
[37:41] captives, recovering of sight to the
[37:43] blind is set at liberty, them that are
[37:45] bruised to preach the acceptable year of
[37:47] the Lord. And from there he says, "This
[37:50] day this scripture is fulfilled." Then
[37:53] when you go uh to uh to brother Brandham
[37:57] in a in another sermon, he takes where
[38:00] Jesus is coming riding in uh in in
[38:04] fulfillment of prophecy. And so in one
[38:07] in the first instance in the temple, he
[38:10] is identifying himself as the
[38:13] fulfillment of prophecy. But when he
[38:15] comes riding in, he's not just
[38:18] announcing something. He's actually
[38:20] embodying it. And that was a big point
[38:23] that you understand because the whole
[38:26] purpose of the gospel and I might I'm
[38:28] going to get ahead of myself to say
[38:30] this, but you know, you can you can come
[38:32] upon a a pond of water and everything is
[38:36] still. And if you take a rock and you
[38:38] toss it out into the middle, you'll get
[38:40] those like concentric rings that just go
[38:42] outward in ripples and they just go on
[38:45] and on and on all the way to the shore
[38:47] in all directions all at the same time.
[38:50] And we find that that's exactly how the
[38:53] gospel was to go forth. That Jesus said,
[38:56] "You'll first be a witness in Jerusalem,
[38:59] then in Judea, Samaria, the uttermost
[39:01] part of the earth." So, it's like rings
[39:03] going out until it finally will cover
[39:06] the whole earth. And after 2,000 years
[39:08] of church history, and Jesus prophesies,
[39:12] when this gospel is preached in all the
[39:14] world, that's when the end will come.
[39:16] Now we are we know we can see why it
[39:20] would take when we say there were seven
[39:21] ages and at the last age you had the
[39:24] return of the ministry of the son of
[39:27] man. You not only had the office you had
[39:29] a prophet but you had the ministry of
[39:30] the son of man which would be the
[39:32] fullness of the word living in a people.
[39:36] And because that's the gospel that Jesus
[39:39] was referring to. Jesus said when this
[39:41] gospel
[39:42] &gt;&gt; which gospel what was he? He was the
[39:45] word made flesh. When the word in its
[39:47] fullness is living behind skin, when
[39:50] that gospel repeats again at the end
[39:53] time, that's when the end will come. And
[39:55] so it was after the seed would go into
[39:57] the ground after seven ages and at the
[39:59] end of the seventh age that ministry of
[40:02] the word made flesh would appear again.
[40:05] And it's the exact same principle. We
[40:07] can stand up today and announce this day
[40:11] this scripture is fulfilled. Not just in
[40:13] words, but now comes the allimp
[40:15] important part where we actually live
[40:17] it, where it's actually actionable
[40:20] action in our lives. And so we're not
[40:22] just declaring fulfillment, we are
[40:25] embodying fulfillment.
[40:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:29] &gt;&gt; Does that blow your fuses?
[40:32] &gt;&gt; You understand that? So, so we're
[40:34] actually publicly embodying that
[40:38] prophecy when that Jesus spoke of. So,
[40:41] we found out last time we had another
[40:43] example that we gave you. We found where
[40:46] the Apostle Paul uh it goes back and
[40:50] pick and picking up a reference out of
[40:52] Isaiah 59 where he he he he put upon
[40:57] himself righteousness as a breastplate
[41:00] and a helmet of salvation upon his head.
[41:03] And then he goes and then right after
[41:04] that he's going to start going into
[41:06] judgment. He's he's covered in zeal and
[41:09] vengeance. So we know that right before
[41:11] the tribulation, we can see in the
[41:13] scripture that right before the
[41:14] tribulation of judgment when he goes
[41:16] forth judging, he will appear in his
[41:19] body. And as Paul picks it up when he he
[41:22] points back to it in Ephesians 6, that
[41:25] we are to have on the breastplate of
[41:27] righteousness that we are to have a
[41:29] helmet of salvation. We are to take. So
[41:31] the prophecy that is in Isaiah 59 would
[41:35] be a fulfillment. it would be embodied
[41:37] in his church all down through the ages.
[41:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:42] &gt;&gt; And then when that has happened again,
[41:44] there's the there's another one. When
[41:46] you see the word embodied all the way
[41:49] down through the ages after the seed has
[41:51] went in the ground after it went all the
[41:52] way into dark ages after it came back up
[41:55] to a complete restoration just like Joel
[41:57] prophesied then then now once again the
[42:01] ministry is upon a people who have on
[42:04] the breastplate of righteousness who
[42:05] have a helmet of salvation who also
[42:07] because now it's not just Isaiah 59 now
[42:11] it's in it's it's in Ephesians 6 because
[42:14] now it's under the Holy Ghost era So it
[42:16] not only has a helmet of salvation, it
[42:18] has a sword of the spirit. It has it has
[42:21] a shield of faith. It has a preparation.
[42:24] Your feet shot with a preparation of the
[42:26] gospel. We have the full measure, the
[42:28] full gospel
[42:29] &gt;&gt; right here at the end time right before
[42:32] the tribulation strikes.
[42:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:36] &gt;&gt; So it it should not surprise you
[42:39] &gt;&gt; when the ministry comes forward and said
[42:41] we need to be living the word of God. it
[42:45] because remember that Jesus didn't just
[42:48] declare it with his lips.
[42:52] He actually embodied it
[42:54] &gt;&gt; and got on the animal and rode him into
[42:57] Jerusalem. So it was more than just us
[43:00] saying God sent a messenger. Well, what
[43:03] was the message? Christ. How so? Because
[43:06] that's his word. Well, then what does
[43:08] that do for you? Makes me the word made
[43:10] flesh. That's the That's the point.
[43:12] That's what it's supposed to do.
[43:14] Friends, do you understand that? Just by
[43:16] these two points alone, all I've done is
[43:18] tie together these prophecies and you
[43:21] can know of assurityity that you are
[43:24] right near the door of a body change. We
[43:26] have lived out all the ages and we're
[43:29] just now ready to take a flight to the
[43:31] skies.
[43:33] There was nothing between
[43:36] Christ and his people putting on the
[43:39] helmet of salvation and the breastplate
[43:41] of righteousness. There was nothing
[43:43] after that except the tribulation.
[43:45] There's nothing sandwiched in between
[43:47] there. And so when you see that in its
[43:50] fulfillment today, I'm here to tell you
[43:52] there's not another age coming. There's
[43:54] no more messengers coming. You are the
[43:56] final voice to the final age.
[43:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:00] &gt;&gt; Does that make sense to you? Yes. Praise
[44:02] God.
[44:02] &gt;&gt; So, it's urgent. No wonder that the
[44:05] ministry uh is constantly urging us
[44:08] forward in our walk.
[44:10] &gt;&gt; We can't just have lip service. Jesus
[44:12] didn't stop that. I don't if you leave
[44:14] here tonight, don't forget that he
[44:17] didn't just stop declaring that he was
[44:20] the prophecy fulfilled with his lips. He
[44:23] actually went on and got on an animal
[44:25] and wrote it in embodying the prophecy.
[44:28] &gt;&gt; Yes. Praise God.
[44:29] &gt;&gt; Why would he do that? Because that was
[44:31] the prophecy to follow the ministry that
[44:34] bound up the brokenhearted, the ministry
[44:37] that preached to sinners, the ministry
[44:38] that opened blinded eyes. That was to
[44:40] follow it. God hasn't given us a message
[44:43] to entertain us. He's given us a message
[44:45] to be embodied so that our life goes
[44:48] forward. And your the final voice is a
[44:51] declared voice in the lives of the
[44:53] people.
[44:54] &gt;&gt; And that the next stage after that is
[44:57] the voice of the resurrection.
[44:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:01] Amen.
[45:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:04] &gt;&gt; So, I just wanted to seal that up in
[45:06] your heart because now when brother
[45:08] Brandham goes to the former and latter
[45:10] reign,
[45:13] oh my, he's he's gripped with with how
[45:17] much he he he shows the parallels and he
[45:21] ties it back into the scripture. Makes
[45:23] it very clear this is the day when this
[45:26] is supposed to happen. And so the that
[45:29] there there there would come a time
[45:31] where people are stumbling in gross
[45:33] darkness. And brother Brandham covers
[45:35] this. If you go back, I would recommend
[45:37] it's an excellent tape if you want to
[45:38] listen to one. It's uh March 3, 1960.
[45:42] And brother Brandham, you know, he he's
[45:44] tying together all of these scriptures
[45:46] to show us where we are. And he and but
[45:49] he's not just he's not just naming it
[45:53] prophecy like Jesus was naming prophecy.
[45:56] this day it's fulfilled in your ears.
[45:58] The words you just heard are fulfilled.
[46:00] But now a church that is supposed to be
[46:04] showing
[46:06] &gt;&gt; the prophecy. They're supposed to be
[46:08] demonstrating the word of the prophecy,
[46:12] but yet they're stumbling in gross
[46:14] darkness. And and brother Brandham deals
[46:16] with this how that it's a people who
[46:18] calling who actually call themselves
[46:21] Christians and yet the women are
[46:23] dressing immorally. The men are smoking
[46:26] and drinking and and cocktail parties
[46:29] and they're and the women are wearing
[46:31] shorts and bobbing their hair and all
[46:33] kinds of makeup. And brother Brandham is
[46:35] say is brother Brandham is showing that
[46:37] this is the hour where there's two stark
[46:41] realities. One is gross darkness and the
[46:44] other is the perfect sunshining.
[46:47] &gt;&gt; One is a famine for hearing the word and
[46:49] the other is floors full of wheat. I I
[46:53] already know what camp I want to be in
[46:55] and there ain't no in between camp.
[47:00] &gt;&gt; He he he talks about how that living
[47:02] sin, you know, sinful living, it
[47:05] produces spiritual blindness. Brother
[47:07] Brandham deals with that. We've been
[47:09] taking this title that, you know, about,
[47:12] you know, sin, sinful living brings
[47:15] forth sin. And we're we're continuing on
[47:17] it tonight. And brother Brandham
[47:19] actually zeros in on how that sinful
[47:23] living, catch this now, sinful living
[47:26] produces blindness.
[47:29] And the problem, the real problem with
[47:32] with blindness is you are it prevents
[47:36] you from having discernment in the time
[47:40] when if you were ever going to need
[47:42] discernment, it's now. Amen.
[47:45] &gt;&gt; You're raising your families in the
[47:47] darkest, most treacherous, most wicked,
[47:50] most perverted, most upside down, inside
[47:53] out. Humanity has never known the level
[47:56] of sin and corruption. If if fathers and
[47:59] mothers ever needed spiritual
[48:00] discernment, it's now. You can't afford
[48:03] to let your lifestyle blind your senses
[48:08] &gt;&gt; of what you see going on around you.
[48:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:15] It signals that the age, the darkness
[48:19] actually signals the age and where we
[48:20] are in the scripture. And it speaks of
[48:23] how that people would have their
[48:26] sensitivity
[48:28] to
[48:30] the not only the word but to what's
[48:32] actually going on around them and their
[48:35] sensitivity would be dulled.
[48:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah. So that it and it's and it's so
[48:39] bad according to Bible prophecy,
[48:42] it's so bad that society as a whole,
[48:47] we're talking global, we're not just
[48:48] talking North America,
[48:50] &gt;&gt; society, global society, governments,
[48:54] courts,
[48:55] schools,
[48:58] business,
[48:59] &gt;&gt; finance,
[49:01] social, the social fabric,
[49:03] entertainments, recreation, church
[49:06] services, home life
[49:09] that everything
[49:12] people would actually lose the ability
[49:17] to discern between right and wrong
[49:20] &gt;&gt; so that they would look at things that
[49:22] society for thousands of years saw as
[49:25] wrong and dangerous and say there's no
[49:28] danger it's all good and we're all just
[49:30] being and and you just need to let
[49:32] everybody be who they are and brother
[49:34] Brandham said they say oh you're an old
[49:36] fogy uh William Brandom you you and he
[49:38] says you you remember this someday
[49:41] friends you'll hear you'll hear this
[49:43] voice for the last time.
[49:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[49:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:47] &gt;&gt; I remember a conversation I had with
[49:49] Billy Paul before some years before he
[49:52] passed away and I was curious about the
[49:56] the testimony brother Brandham tells
[49:57] about how that Billy had a dream. He
[49:59] said Billy doesn't dream uh very often
[50:01] at all. I think it came through brother
[50:04] Brown's mother said he doesn't dream
[50:06] very often and so when he does then he
[50:09] says it's usually something spiritual
[50:11] from the Lord and Billy tells the dream
[50:14] how that that you know there was chaos
[50:17] in the world and things were you know
[50:20] exploding and it was just a violent
[50:22] situation I forget I haven't looked at
[50:24] it in a while but the point I was
[50:26] curious about and wanted to know I said
[50:29] but but brother Brandham tells and I'm
[50:30] talking to brother Billy Paul and I
[50:32] said, he says that in the dream that
[50:35] that you were in church and that and
[50:38] Billy, brother Billy told me, he said,
[50:40] "I was in church and he says, "Dad, come
[50:42] in." And he says fire was flying from
[50:46] his eyes. You can find the quote, "Fire
[50:48] flying from the eyes or something like
[50:50] that." And he says, "It's time to go,
[50:53] Billy." And when he said, "It's time to
[50:56] go," then Ma screamed out, "What about
[51:00] Sarah?" Sarah's a 14-year-old girl.
[51:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[51:03] &gt;&gt; Who was already starting to show signs
[51:06] of rebellion. And she says, "What about
[51:08] Sarah?" And he said, "Daddy just looked
[51:11] very stern and said, she's heard.
[51:14] It's time to go."
[51:17] &gt;&gt; I want to tell you something, friends.
[51:19] It's time to go.
[51:21] &gt;&gt; It's definitely not time to be moving
[51:23] into rebellion. It's definitely not a
[51:26] time to be getting cool on the Lord.
[51:28] It's not a time to be getting distant
[51:30] from the Holy Spirit. Your redemption
[51:32] drawth nigh. It's time to go. It's time
[51:34] to be serious about this.
[51:42] &gt;&gt; So he, brother Ben Brandon, spends that
[51:44] whole sermon tying all of that together.
[51:47] And he comes and I read it for you last
[51:48] time. Oh, let every one of us us be
[51:51] overcomers. See, he wanted to he he he
[51:53] wanted to he said we've got to be
[51:55] overcomers so that so that Christ can
[51:58] live inside of us. And I don't want to I
[52:00] don't want to get slowed down reading
[52:02] reading that whole quote. I read I read
[52:04] this one for you and I'm only going to
[52:06] take these two points in choosing of a
[52:08] bride. He's giving that same straight
[52:11] warning. He says it we should straighten
[52:13] up our lives.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; Things that we have done. Let me advise
[52:16] you as a minister.
[52:18] If you believe me to be God's prophet,
[52:20] you listen to what I've told you. If
[52:21] there's one little tinkle of feeling in
[52:23] your heart, you go to God right now.
[52:26] &gt;&gt; See, and he says Paul and it goes into
[52:29] the rapture. Paul said, "When I was a
[52:31] child, I spake as a child. Thought as a
[52:32] child, you act as a child, but you grow
[52:34] older. You begin from making your first
[52:36] steps, toddle and fall and get up and
[52:38] try it again. Then after a while, you
[52:39] get so you can walk a straight line." He
[52:41] said, "That's what we have to do as
[52:42] soldiers of the cross. Now is time to
[52:46] walk a straight line right down that
[52:48] highway to glory. That's the highway I
[52:50] want to be on.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; So when we when we um
[53:02] let me just read this. I think they're
[53:04] busy getting something prepared for me.
[53:05] I'm just going to read you this from
[53:06] second Timothy chapter 2.
[53:10] Paul says um
[53:14] the servant of the Lord must not strive
[53:15] be gentle unto all men apt to teach
[53:17] patient in meekness instructing those
[53:19] that oppose themselves if God per
[53:22] adventure will give them repentance to
[53:24] the acknowledging of the truth here's an
[53:26] important verse that they may recover
[53:28] themselves out of the snare of the devil
[53:31] who are taken captive those words who
[53:34] are taken captive by him at his will
[53:40] so that they may recover themselves out
[53:43] of the snare of the devil who are taken
[53:45] captive by him at his will. I you know I
[53:49] I I think that I could speak for us all
[53:52] tonight when we would and I don't need a
[53:54] show of hands and this is not we're not
[53:56] setting up a confessional booth but I
[53:58] think we could all agree that there have
[54:00] been times where we were left astonished
[54:03] that Satan just so easily took control
[54:05] of us and we found ourselves over here
[54:08] going what in the world am I doing
[54:10] &gt;&gt; back over here my goodness Lord I'm a
[54:12] Christian I'm a believer and that's true
[54:14] and you really are but I'm here to tell
[54:16] you friends He goeth about like a
[54:18] roaring lion. He This is a dark age and
[54:21] you cannot afford to let your life slip
[54:24] into the edges of carnality because it's
[54:26] a slippery slope that will only take you
[54:29] further and further away from God.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; And this is not the hour for that to
[54:33] happen. This is in fact the plight of
[54:35] too many of God's four ordained
[54:38] children. I'm I'm giving it to you that
[54:39] you're for ordained,
[54:41] &gt;&gt; you know. Um you know, and and and that
[54:44] but but because you are for you say,
[54:46] "Well, I'm for ordained."
[54:48] Okay, great. For ordained to do what?
[54:52] &gt;&gt; Well, to make heaven. Okay, great. But
[54:55] what do you that's then? What about now?
[54:58] Well, I'm supposed to believe. Yeah, you
[55:00] better. But what does that mean?
[55:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[55:03] &gt;&gt; You know, don't put it off in the misty
[55:05] blue. Don't put it off, you know, and
[55:07] say, "Well, I I can't be lost. I was in
[55:09] it. I was in it." Yeah, that's all
[55:10] that's all correct. I'm predestinated
[55:12] not to fall. That's all correct. But
[55:14] what is my mission right now? I'm
[55:16] predestinated to be fighting on the
[55:18] front lines in God's army. I'm not
[55:21] supposed to be sitting back thankful
[55:23] that I can't be lost. If I'm if I really
[55:26] am that person, then I'm going to want
[55:28] to be able to say, "Give me a sword of
[55:29] the spirit. Give me a shield of faith.
[55:31] Give me a helmet of salvation.
[55:34] Yes.
[55:37] &gt;&gt; To many of God's four ordained children
[55:40] who are supposed to be fighting on the
[55:42] front lines,
[55:45] and I almost use this for a text
[55:46] tonight, the story of Samson, because
[55:50] we're supposed to be fighting on the
[55:51] front lines, but too many of God's four
[55:54] ordained children,
[55:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm giving. I'm granting that too
[55:58] many of God's elect lady, too many of
[56:01] God's chosen vessels find themselves
[56:04] like Samson being taken captive by the
[56:07] very enemy that you're supposed to
[56:10] destroy.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; God help us all. God help me.
[56:14] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[56:16] &gt;&gt; It's the plight of too many of God's
[56:18] four ordained children. That's the
[56:19] plight of too many parents. And I and
[56:22] and I I I I so hate the devil. I I don't
[56:25] want to see any more parents have to sit
[56:28] and cry and watch their teenagers drift
[56:32] off, drift off, drift off, and finally
[56:34] break away and roll off into the world.
[56:37] I I want to see the young people full of
[56:40] the Holy Ghost.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; I want to see parents that care enough
[56:45] to do whatever is necessary to make sure
[56:47] their children are in church and hearing
[56:49] tapes and reading their Bible and having
[56:51] fellowship. I cannot imagine that a
[56:54] parent who says they love their child
[56:56] does not does not lay aside every weight
[56:59] and sin and run the race fervently with
[57:02] zeal.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:05] &gt;&gt; I cannot see that parents who constantly
[57:08] allow careers and job and school keep
[57:11] them out of church, keep their kids out
[57:13] of church and and and have no problem
[57:15] getting them to all the social events
[57:17] and all the recreational events, but
[57:19] come to the house of God. Sorry, we
[57:21] can't make it.
[57:24] &gt;&gt; Oh my. That's not in my notes. That
[57:26] one's free. You can have it.
[57:32] &gt;&gt; I'm tired of seeing that happen.
[57:35] Teenagers captured by the enemy. It's
[57:38] bad enough if if you were vigilant and
[57:41] as a parent and and you tried to always
[57:44] secure the borders of your family, but
[57:47] it's uh it's way more painful if you
[57:50] didn't. And then you see that to see
[57:53] those loved ones carried about by every
[57:56] wind of doctrine and don't think they
[57:57] won't be.
[57:58] &gt;&gt; To see those you love taken by every
[58:03] snare of the devil when they are, as the
[58:05] scripture said, taken captive by him at
[58:09] his will. But I'm just glad tonight
[58:11] there's another power greater than that
[58:14] power. I'm glad I'm connected to a
[58:16] greater power. I'm glad I got someone
[58:19] who can fix the problems, who can make
[58:21] up the shortfall, and who can go after
[58:23] my family.
[58:25] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[58:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; Satan doesn't get the last word.
[58:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[58:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[58:32] &gt;&gt; Unless you give it to him.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; I say don't give it to him.
[58:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; I There's one who who can save them
[58:39] according to his promise if I'll believe
[58:42] it.
[58:43] &gt;&gt; See, say, "Oh, well, I believe it."
[58:46] Well,
[58:48] Real believing. You might believe
[58:50] something's true, but real believing is
[58:52] when you're willing. When you're
[58:54] willing, when you're willing to hear,
[58:57] recognize, and act upon the word of God.
[59:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:03] &gt;&gt; That's when God will do the impossible
[59:05] part.
[59:07] Amen. Yeah,
[59:11] &gt;&gt; as I've been saying to you, sinful
[59:13] transgressions come from living in
[59:17] sinful ways.
[59:20] You you you don't in you don't intend to
[59:23] get fleas when you slept near a feral
[59:27] dog.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; But that's what happens.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; Feral dogs get fleas.
[59:33] That wasn't your intention to get fleas,
[59:36] but that's what happens. You see, and I
[59:39] I I want you to understand tonight,
[59:42] you know, pharaoh means like it was a
[59:44] domesticated animal that got free and
[59:46] went into the wilderness and became
[59:48] pharaoh. Became wild.
[59:50] &gt;&gt; Hogs get out of hogs break out from
[59:52] farmers and they're they're
[59:53] domesticated. They break out and go into
[59:55] the wilderness. You never see them
[59:56] again. They go wild. Dogs do that. Cats
[59:58] do that. They become feral. And I the
[1:00:00] reason I'm bringing that up tonight is I
[1:00:02] want to make you aware of something. I'm
[1:00:04] sure you know it, but I hope you I hope
[1:00:06] that this language will prick your
[1:00:09] conscience. Uh, you see, there is such a
[1:00:12] thing as feral spirits from the
[1:00:14] underworld.
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; They roam the earth looking for friendly
[1:00:20] lodging.
[1:00:22] They're really they're feral angels
[1:00:24] really is what they are.
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; And just like feral hogs or any
[1:00:29] domesticated animal, they escaped into
[1:00:32] the wild. They became feral. They are
[1:00:35] feral angels who once walked proudly.
[1:00:40] These these demon spirits, let me just
[1:00:43] put it in plain language. These demons
[1:00:48] are feral angels.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; That used to walk the grandeur and the
[1:00:53] beautiful shores of heaven.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; They used to walk in and out of the
[1:00:57] temple of God. They used to worship God.
[1:01:00] These demons
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; that are controlling the world, that are
[1:01:04] sucking the life out of your children.
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; They are feral angels
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; that used to know the pleasures of
[1:01:11] walking and serving God. But they fell
[1:01:15] for the lie of Lucifer and they joined
[1:01:18] his rebellion and they became fallen
[1:01:21] angels. Isaiah 14:12.
[1:01:25] How art thou fallen from heaven, oh
[1:01:28] Lucifer, son of the morning? How art
[1:01:31] thou cut down to the ground which did
[1:01:35] weaken the nations? That's Isaiah 14:12.
[1:01:40] You talk about
[1:01:42] regretting
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; that you hung out with the wrong crowd.
[1:01:47] I wonder if those fallen angels
[1:01:51] when they realized they'd lost the the
[1:01:53] war,
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; they'd been kicked out, they'd been cast
[1:01:56] down into hell and hell got created as a
[1:01:59] prison for the devil and his angels.
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; These now feral angels, these demons who
[1:02:05] used to walk the wonderful streets of
[1:02:08] glory and they fell for Satan's lie. I
[1:02:11] wonder if they ever asked themselves
[1:02:13] that question. How did I ever allow
[1:02:16] myself to fall for his lie?
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; Only that only to realize there was no
[1:02:23] way back for them.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; And they're reserved in chains of
[1:02:27] darkness according to the Bible, waiting
[1:02:29] for the day of judgment. You're talking
[1:02:31] about regretting the crowd that you hung
[1:02:34] out with. Think of think of it, friends.
[1:02:37] Think about this. I I thought to myself,
[1:02:39] you know, the the in the trail of the
[1:02:42] serpent.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, brother Brandham tracks the
[1:02:45] trail of the serpent from Isaiah 14
[1:02:50] where he is the son of the morning.
[1:02:54] And how precipitous is is the fall? How
[1:02:57] far?
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; Ask yourselves tonight, and I'm not
[1:03:00] going to give you the answer. I want you
[1:03:01] to imagine it in your own mind.
[1:03:04] How far is it in the trail of the
[1:03:07] serpent? How do you go from being the
[1:03:10] son of the morning?
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; Your right hand to the throne. You stand
[1:03:17] on the right side of God Almighty.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; You're the son of the morning, the most
[1:03:22] beautiful angel. You're you're an
[1:03:24] archangel.
[1:03:26] How do you go from this being the son of
[1:03:29] the morning and plunging all the way
[1:03:32] down to all of the depravity that we
[1:03:36] know now as the devil.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; That fall is nearly immeasurable in my
[1:03:45] mind, if not completely so. And I will
[1:03:48] assure you tonight that that same
[1:03:51] Lucifer has an immeasurable amount of
[1:03:54] failure lined up for you if you follow
[1:03:57] him.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; There is no limit. I will assure you, he
[1:04:00] has no limit. There's no limit to the
[1:04:02] depths. Hear me. There is no limit to
[1:04:05] the depths that he will take you. And
[1:04:07] he'll get you dabbling with this and
[1:04:09] dabbling with that. And you won't be two
[1:04:11] or three moons later and you'll be
[1:04:13] entrenched in it. Break free, friends.
[1:04:15] Your eagles. Fly away from that kind of
[1:04:17] stuff.
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; Sinful lifestyle brings sin. Carnal
[1:04:21] lifestyle makes you weak.
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; As far as you will allow him to take
[1:04:28] you. And I give you my word, it's
[1:04:30] further than you can imagine.
[1:04:33] Find anybody on Skidro will tell you
[1:04:36] that they didn't start out life on
[1:04:37] Skidro.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; They started out in their right mind.
[1:04:41] Innocent child.
[1:04:43] Somehow they got imprinted. so imprinted
[1:04:45] with the world, they've lost all hope
[1:04:47] and live in squalor.
[1:04:54] I want to say this to you.
[1:04:58] These Pharaoh angels,
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; These demons,
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; yes,
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; they will camp
[1:05:09] as close as you will allow them. Right.
[1:05:12] Amen.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; Their goal is to surround you,
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; inhabit you,
[1:05:19] permeate every aspect of your life, and
[1:05:24] and they're they actually are desiring.
[1:05:26] What you don't realize is they're not
[1:05:29] just desiring to make you fall
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; so they can laugh at you. Their design
[1:05:35] and their desire is to express
[1:05:38] themselves,
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; but they need a body.
[1:05:42] They can't express themselves as human
[1:05:44] beings. They have to have a body.
[1:05:47] Brother Brandon would say a devil is
[1:05:49] almost powerless unless he can get
[1:05:52] somebody to work through. And you can
[1:05:55] see that you can see it on people. You
[1:05:57] can people don't realize that that that
[1:05:59] that they are actually is I mean it it
[1:06:02] literally affects their appearance,
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; their garments, their language,
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; where they go, what they do. And those
[1:06:11] people think, "Oh, I don't want anything
[1:06:13] to do with God. I like my freedom." You
[1:06:16] have no freedom. You are a complete
[1:06:18] prisoner to demons inside you who are
[1:06:21] the reason you dress like that and act
[1:06:23] like that and look like that and talk
[1:06:24] like that and parade around like that
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; is because you've got a demon spirit
[1:06:29] who's expressing his life through you.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; See this was this was what see Satan the
[1:06:37] problem was remember this goes back to
[1:06:39] creation. Satan couldn't create
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; he couldn't do like God. He couldn't
[1:06:43] create his own. So, so the whole process
[1:06:46] is is to take God's created humans and
[1:06:49] and indwell them so that they can ju
[1:06:52] just like God wants to be embodied in
[1:06:54] his church, Satan wants to be embodied
[1:06:56] in his church.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; And when you have uncommitted churches
[1:07:04] uncommitted to the straight laced
[1:07:06] gospel,
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. When you have un unspiritual
[1:07:10] homes,
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; when you have non nonfervent supposed to
[1:07:15] be Christians,
[1:07:18] this is where these Pharaoh angels find
[1:07:21] their greatest access.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; I'm going to say it again. Uncommitted
[1:07:26] churches, unspiritual homes, nonfervent
[1:07:30] humans, and that are supposed to be full
[1:07:32] of the Holy Spirit. This is where the
[1:07:35] these feral angels find their greatest
[1:07:39] access. How art thou fallen from heaven.
[1:07:43] Oh Lucifer, son of the morning. Listen,
[1:07:46] friend, I it's not it's not unheard of
[1:07:48] for sons of God's family to hear a
[1:07:51] question like that. Only it's not how
[1:07:54] art thou fallen, but it's Adam, where
[1:07:57] art thou?
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Brother Brandham says in
[1:08:02] this sermon here, and I'm brother Matt's
[1:08:04] going to play a clip for me from having
[1:08:06] conferences. Brother Brandham says how
[1:08:08] he he ran up and down the garden. Adam,
[1:08:13] Adam. And I I thought I'll just I'll
[1:08:16] just memorize how he inflects and I'll
[1:08:17] say it and I listen to it fresh. And I
[1:08:20] said, I could never capture the
[1:08:21] prophet's urgency. And I want you to
[1:08:24] listen to it with me now. Go ahead, son.
[1:08:31] When God knew that that shocking state
[1:08:35] of emergency, I suppose the first ever
[1:08:38] came to heaven
[1:08:40] was when he heard that his children was
[1:08:42] lost.
[1:08:44] And he came
[1:08:46] frantically
[1:08:48] up and down through the garden. He went,
[1:08:52] looking under every bush.
[1:08:54] Adam.
[1:08:56] Oh my son Adam, where art thou?
[1:09:00] There stood Adam and Eve with their fig
[1:09:03] leaves sewed together
[1:09:06] behind the bush.
[1:09:09] Father going back and forth screaming,
[1:09:11] "Where are you? Where are you?"
[1:09:15] That same God
[1:09:18] goes up and down the aisles, night after
[1:09:20] night, screaming the same thing.
[1:09:23] Where art thou? Where art thou?
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; Where art thou? Where art thou?
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; Adam and Eve.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; That's the cry of the Holy Spirit of a
[1:09:32] creed that they have or denomination
[1:09:34] there. There are
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; So if you caught that when he says the
[1:09:42] father going back and forth screaming,
[1:09:44] "Where are you? Where are you?" See, it
[1:09:49] wasn't just where are you? Where are
[1:09:50] you? It's where are you? Where are you?
[1:09:53] It's it's it's not just God saying, "Oh,
[1:09:56] I can't find you, son. I have no idea. I
[1:09:58] know I'm God, but I have no idea where
[1:10:00] you actually are." God knew right where
[1:10:02] they are. The cry is not, "I can't find
[1:10:04] you, Adam." The cry is, "Adam, where are
[1:10:07] you? How did you get this? How did you
[1:10:09] get into this condition? I gave you a
[1:10:11] perfect world. I gave you my word. I
[1:10:14] visited you every day. Where are you?
[1:10:16] Where are you?
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, let me say tonight, friends, where
[1:10:20] are you? You might not be hearing, "Oh,
[1:10:22] how art thou fallen from heaven,
[1:10:24] Lucifer, son of the morning." But God's
[1:10:26] family is hearing tonight. Where are
[1:10:28] you? Where are you? Hallelujah. Oh, I'm
[1:10:31] so glad that when that voice came, it
[1:10:34] was not a prophet like Isaiah indicting
[1:10:36] me, but it was my heavenly father
[1:10:38] running up and down the avenues of my
[1:10:40] life saying, "Son, oh son, where are
[1:10:43] you, my son?"
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad that when the cry came out,
[1:10:47] I had a way back. Hallelujah, friends.
[1:10:50] Amen.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; Oh my. That same God up and down the
[1:10:53] aisles night after night screaming the
[1:10:56] same thing. Where art thou?
[1:10:59] Where art thou?
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:03] So it's through individuals,
[1:11:06] individual people,
[1:11:09] individual families
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; and through their churches and through
[1:11:13] the churches of and churches are just
[1:11:16] collections of families.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; And families are groupings of people.
[1:11:20] And so it's individuals make up
[1:11:22] families. Families make up churches. And
[1:11:25] God has ordained that to spread the
[1:11:28] gospel around the world. God has
[1:11:30] ordained
[1:11:32] that this is how his kingdom flourishes.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; So
[1:11:38] when
[1:11:40] when there is no flourishing
[1:11:44] of the life of God,
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; coming from your home,
[1:11:49] is that God's fault?
[1:11:52] Don't even say it's the devil's fault.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; You have to just say, "Lord God, have
[1:11:58] mercy on me." Yes.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; When we don't see a church with the
[1:12:03] signs and wonders and the power of God
[1:12:05] and miracles to cast out devils, not
[1:12:08] even by laying on of hands, just
[1:12:09] preaching the gospel. I'm going to tell
[1:12:11] you something, friends. If I thought
[1:12:12] that this gospel couldn't cast out
[1:12:14] devils, I'd have hung it up a long time
[1:12:16] ago and become a psychologist. But I've
[1:12:18] seen what this gospel can do. I've seen
[1:12:21] that it casts out devils and it it heals
[1:12:24] the sick and it raises the dead and it
[1:12:26] opens blinded eyes both natural and
[1:12:28] spiritual. I've seen these things
[1:12:30] happen. I've seen young people bound get
[1:12:33] free. I've seen old people bound get
[1:12:36] free. I've seen the Holy Ghost while I
[1:12:38] was preaching
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; the Holy Ghost falling upon them and
[1:12:42] then and then with the gifts added to
[1:12:43] the church and laying on of hands and
[1:12:45] anointing with oil and the prayer of
[1:12:46] faith. How why would we want to be a
[1:12:49] powerless church? I have nothing to do
[1:12:51] with a powerless church. I want a church
[1:12:53] that's sold out. I want families that
[1:12:55] are sold out. I want to see the power of
[1:12:57] God moving. And I want to see the devil
[1:12:59] running.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; Pastors, parents, individuals
[1:13:08] hear this warning friends.
[1:13:12] pastors, preachers, parents, individuals
[1:13:16] themselves.
[1:13:18] They they open up their most prized
[1:13:23] possessions to spiritual torture and
[1:13:26] spiritual grief when they let down the
[1:13:28] bars in their churches,
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; in their homes or in their lives.
[1:13:37] When ministry,
[1:13:39] when parents
[1:13:41] or when individuals don't take a fervent
[1:13:44] stand,
[1:13:46] then there's no way to stop the devil.
[1:13:50] When he comes in like a flood and come
[1:13:53] in like a flood, he shall.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; Oh my friends, when he goes about
[1:13:59] seeking whom he may devour, but neither
[1:14:02] ministry nor parents nor individuals
[1:14:05] will take a fervent stand, then who will
[1:14:08] be there to stand in the gap and say,
[1:14:10] "Thus far and no further."
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; Oh, that's not a kind of family or a
[1:14:15] kind of a church or the kind of person I
[1:14:17] want to be. I want to know that the
[1:14:19] authority of the almighty God flows
[1:14:22] through me.
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; It's not power for the sake of power.
[1:14:25] The way up is always down.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; It's humbling yourself to the word of
[1:14:30] God.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; I think about how many homes and how
[1:14:33] many lives and how many whole churches
[1:14:35] whole churches
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; have been swept aside by the enemy,
[1:14:38] driven off the battlefield and
[1:14:39] vanquished completely
[1:14:42] blown to pieces. families that that
[1:14:45] worshiped together and sat in church and
[1:14:47] cried and worshiped God and raised hands
[1:14:49] today blown to smitherines.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; Parents in every direction, children in
[1:14:55] every direction and that happens to
[1:14:57] whole churches. I think about Life
[1:14:58] Tabernacle and how many times brother
[1:15:00] Brandon went there and and and they're
[1:15:02] in Louisiana and shreport
[1:15:04] Life Tabernacle. some of the most
[1:15:06] fantastic miracles and things that
[1:15:08] happen there.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; And and yet you go there today and it's
[1:15:12] just a it's just a a dead morg of a
[1:15:16] so-called church. There's no life of the
[1:15:18] word there. There's no life and liberty
[1:15:20] there. and the and the and the old place
[1:15:22] where right across the street where
[1:15:24] brother Brandham was right in that area
[1:15:26] holding meetings and now it's a museum
[1:15:29] to the king of rock and roll
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; and you literally can walk out of the
[1:15:34] parking lot as I remember it from life
[1:15:36] tabernacle and look and there's a
[1:15:38] there's a big larger than life statue of
[1:15:41] a modernday Judas's scariot
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; I'm here to tell you why did that happen
[1:15:45] because that church rejected the message
[1:15:47] of the hour
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; and it blown to blew to pieces is I
[1:15:50] don't that's not going to be my my
[1:15:53] plight. I don't want that to be your
[1:15:55] plight. I want this to be a shining
[1:15:56] beacon on a hill. I want that when the
[1:15:59] Lord comes, he'll find the liberty that
[1:16:01] he has among our lives.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; Yes. Hallelujah.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; I think about life tabernacle. I think
[1:16:08] about other other churches that I've
[1:16:10] known and oh, but that's not the end of
[1:16:12] the story. And let me say it like this.
[1:16:15] That's not the word for the bride. The
[1:16:17] word for the bride is thy floors shall
[1:16:20] be full of wheat and the fat shall
[1:16:22] overflow with wine and oil. Hallelujah.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon when he went beyond the
[1:16:30] curtain of time, that iconic moment when
[1:16:34] he heard that voice and the whole thing
[1:16:36] is starting to fade from view and one of
[1:16:39] the last things right before he has to
[1:16:41] go back that he hears all that you ever
[1:16:45] loved. Oh yes.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; And all that ever loved you, God has
[1:16:52] given you.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm going to tell you something,
[1:16:55] friends. It's true. There is a way that
[1:16:57] seemth right to a man, and the end
[1:16:59] thereof is destruction. But thank God,
[1:17:01] there is a true way that we can live in.
[1:17:04] There is a true path that you can walk
[1:17:06] on. And and and you can be a real
[1:17:09] standard. You can be you can you can be
[1:17:12] a real standard raised up to stop Satan
[1:17:14] in his tracks. Hallelujah.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; I vote for stopping him.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; I vote for stopping him.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; How many vote with me?
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; I vote for stopping him in his tracks.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; Revelation 16. He hath made us not
[1:17:31] failures and peasants.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; He hath made us kings and priests unto
[1:17:35] God and his father. I'm here to tell you
[1:17:38] God has placed the full await and
[1:17:40] authority of all of heaven into the
[1:17:43] hands of his redeemed family so that all
[1:17:46] that you ever loved and all that ever
[1:17:49] loved you can walk in the freedom of the
[1:17:51] Holy Spirit. He's raised you up so that
[1:17:54] all that ever loved you and all that you
[1:17:56] ever loved can breathe free air, can
[1:17:59] breathe a Holy Spirit. I'm so glad
[1:18:02] tonight that we have a bomb in Gilead
[1:18:05] and it has it is a cure for any disease,
[1:18:08] spiritual, sickness, emotional,
[1:18:11] financial, it doesn't matter what it is.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; All that I ever loved and all that ever
[1:18:19] loved me can soar into the heavenly
[1:18:22] atmospheres. That's what I want.
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want all that I ever love to be
[1:18:27] able to soar into the joys of the Lord
[1:18:29] every day, today, tomorrow, for the rest
[1:18:32] of their lives.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; Not an imaginary freedom.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; No, no, no. Not somewhere over a
[1:18:38] rainbow.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; But right now,
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; I believe he's a right now God.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; How many believe? How many accept he's a
[1:18:45] right now God?
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; See, I want a right now God.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; And the floors shall be full of wheat. I
[1:18:53] got nine, eight and a half minutes.
[1:18:56] And the floors shall be full of wheat.
[1:18:59] The fat shall overflow with wine and
[1:19:01] oil. And I will restore to you the years
[1:19:06] that the locust hath eaten. The canker
[1:19:09] worm and the caterpillar and the palmer
[1:19:10] worm, my great army which I sent among
[1:19:13] you. See,
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; this actually
[1:19:21] identifies
[1:19:23] the tactics of the devil
[1:19:27] in this scripture because notice how he
[1:19:29] says, "I'm going to restore
[1:19:32] in stages what was taken from you
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; in stages."
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; So, this is exactly the tactic of the
[1:19:40] enemy. He slowly cuts off your ferveny.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham dealt with this in in
[1:19:47] restoration of the bride tree. That's
[1:19:49] another good one. Go listen to it. It
[1:19:50] started out the tree was blossoming.
[1:19:52] Fruit was in the top. The church was
[1:19:55] ripening on toward the rapture. I get
[1:19:57] the seed had to go into the ground. I
[1:19:58] understand that.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; Uh but but then it takes away the fruits
[1:20:03] and then it takes away the leaves and
[1:20:05] then it take and and then it starts
[1:20:06] getting into the bark and it gets all
[1:20:08] the way down to the root. Yeah.
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; And so he's going to restore that bride
[1:20:12] tree back to where the last thing before
[1:20:14] the rapture is the fruit is ripening in
[1:20:16] the top of the tree again.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; And that's where we are, friends. Not
[1:20:20] another stage.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; The the next stage above fruit ripening
[1:20:23] in the top of the tree. You'd have to
[1:20:25] fly. And that's what's going to happen.
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes. Yes.
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; See,
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; but slowly over time, I just want to
[1:20:33] deal with that before we close because I
[1:20:35] I I want to make this point to you and
[1:20:38] really get it in good in case this is my
[1:20:40] third and or third or fourth and final
[1:20:43] installment of this little little
[1:20:45] thought that's I thought it was a little
[1:20:47] thought and here I am four parts of it.
[1:20:48] It's just burning my heart up.
[1:20:51] But let me just speak to you about
[1:20:53] something that you'll know is reality. I
[1:20:55] won't even have to talk very much about
[1:20:57] it.
[1:20:58] You're well acquainted with the trial
[1:21:01] after trial.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; Hardship after hardship.
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; Satan just piling on, piling on. Starts
[1:21:09] to cut off our ferveny. Starts to cut
[1:21:12] off our zeal. Starts to cut off our
[1:21:14] fellowship. Starts to suddenly you're
[1:21:17] not reading your Bible like you used to.
[1:21:19] And even when you do, you don't enjoy it
[1:21:20] as much anymore. Those those prayers are
[1:21:24] getting shorter and shorter and fewer
[1:21:26] and further in between
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; and Satan is piling onto our lives the
[1:21:31] weariness of mind that accumulates. This
[1:21:35] is his tactic.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; And he just a little here and a little
[1:21:39] there and a little here. And it doesn't
[1:21:42] seem like much to you because it's just
[1:21:44] little installments until you get way
[1:21:47] over here and you're three or four
[1:21:49] levels down the mountain where you used
[1:21:51] to be. How did I get down here? You were
[1:21:55] you were every day reaching for a higher
[1:21:58] handhold and pulling yourself up higher
[1:22:00] on the mountain. And now you find you're
[1:22:03] looking up at your own trail. There's
[1:22:04] where I used to be.
[1:22:07] You think that the devil isn't a master
[1:22:10] at that.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; Slowly over time,
[1:22:15] trial after trial, hardship after
[1:22:18] hardship, rejection after rejection, it
[1:22:21] begins to accumulate. And year after
[1:22:23] year, he takes and he takes and he
[1:22:25] takes. But I I want to I want to give
[1:22:28] you this tonight.
[1:22:31] Everything that Satan has taken from us,
[1:22:36] this message was sent to give it back.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; Your peace that passes understanding,
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; the joy of the Lord, the oil of
[1:22:48] gladness, the wine of stimulation.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; I'm here to tell you something, friends.
[1:22:53] This message of the son of man has come
[1:22:56] to restore. I will restore all the years
[1:23:00] everything that Satan ever took from me.
[1:23:03] Uh all the years that Satan now uses to
[1:23:07] plague your faith and to steal your joy
[1:23:11] and rob you of all the redemptive
[1:23:13] blessings that God intends for you and
[1:23:16] died for you to enjoy. I'm here to tell
[1:23:20] you this message is giving it back. It's
[1:23:22] restoring the message. The me listen
[1:23:25] friend let me let me say this to young
[1:23:27] young young teenagers because the devil
[1:23:29] tells you oh if I serve God I got to
[1:23:32] give up this I got to give up that I
[1:23:34] can't do this I can't do that. The
[1:23:37] message does not come to take things
[1:23:39] from you. The message comes to set you
[1:23:42] free and give you all the most valuable
[1:23:45] things. The only things that's keeping
[1:23:47] you from are the things that are killing
[1:23:48] you. And he he because you God wants you
[1:23:51] to have life and liberty in the Holy
[1:23:53] Ghost.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; It comes to restore.
[1:23:58] It doesn't come to
[1:24:00] destroy my life. The The message doesn't
[1:24:03] come The message doesn't come to make me
[1:24:06] lose my children.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; The message doesn't come to cut me off
[1:24:10] from my family because I've been a
[1:24:12] believer. That's not why it came. I'm
[1:24:14] here to tell you, you're in the age of
[1:24:16] restoration. And God is going to recover
[1:24:18] our children. And God is going to
[1:24:20] restore our families because we are
[1:24:22] believers. I hope you're a believer
[1:24:24] tonight.
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You can take back. You don't
[1:24:28] have to have sickness to take you down
[1:24:30] to the grave in some sorrowful, slow
[1:24:33] defeat. I I'm here to tell you, yes, you
[1:24:35] say, "Well, people do die, right? To
[1:24:38] live for me to live is Christ, but to
[1:24:40] die is not loss. To die is gain.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; See,
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; you can take back your faith.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; You can take back your joy.
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; You're you're already an elected child.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; You're already greatly loved. You're
[1:25:03] already highly favored.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; What does hinder you?
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; What does hinder you? He Paul said, "Oh,
[1:25:09] you foolish Galatians. What hinders
[1:25:11] you?" Come on, Bethl Tabernacle. What
[1:25:13] does hinder you really?
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; It's not God. It's not his word. Don't
[1:25:17] even go blaming the devil. It's me, not
[1:25:20] my brother, nor my sister, nor my

[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; Brother Mark Lowry, we sent in a prayer
[1:29:54] request tomorrow morning. I have a big
[1:29:57] meeting with a potential client. This is
[1:30:00] a really big opportunity for brother
[1:30:02] Mark. And he said, "I I need the Lord's
[1:30:05] blessing." He said, "I" He told me
[1:30:07] personally, he said, "I need more than a
[1:30:08] normal blessing." I said, "Well, buddy,
[1:30:10] we're going to pray." Amen. Praise the
[1:30:12] Lord. Brother Kenny wrote in, "One of
[1:30:15] our employees
[1:30:17] husband was in a terrible traffic
[1:30:19] accident. Had to be rushed to MUSC and
[1:30:22] could you remember him? I don't have the
[1:30:24] name, but um it's one of their employees
[1:30:27] there." So, they were dealing with that
[1:30:29] this afternoon and the suddeness of that
[1:30:31] and interrupting of their whole
[1:30:32] schedule. So, let's be praying for these
[1:30:34] things. Amen. You got a need, you want
[1:30:36] to raise up a hand to the Lord tonight.
[1:30:38] Amen. Hold that hand up so the Lord can
[1:30:39] see it. Now, this ain't just a a thing
[1:30:41] we do. I got a real need. I got a number
[1:30:44] of them in my heart. Amen. Uh take a
[1:30:47] hold somebody standing near you. Join
[1:30:49] with them in prayer.
[1:30:51] Master, we thank you, Lord God, for this
[1:30:54] wonderful opportunity to come into your
[1:30:56] presence, Lord, and to hear the word of
[1:30:58] God preach. And I'm grateful to you,
[1:31:00] Lord. I was I was able to completely,
[1:31:03] Lord, evacuate my whole heart with that
[1:31:05] thought. I I feel like I've I've I've
[1:31:08] clenched it, Lord. The the nail should
[1:31:10] be clenched at this point, Lord. Lord,
[1:31:12] the people ought to know that that that
[1:31:14] carnal, edgy lifestyle, those sinful
[1:31:17] ways, all that does is multiply more
[1:31:19] failure in our lives. And you have
[1:31:21] called us to a higher standard. You've
[1:31:24] called us to be more than that, Lord.
[1:31:26] You've called us to rise up above the
[1:31:28] darkness of this evil age and shine
[1:31:31] forth the light of your glory. Shine
[1:31:33] forth the power of God. We are supposed
[1:31:36] to know you in your power and
[1:31:39] conjunction, your resurrection. Lord, I
[1:31:42] pray that you'll grant it to us tonight.
[1:31:44] We claim deliverance, Lord, and that
[1:31:46] you'll help in this time of trouble for
[1:31:48] this employee, the husband of this
[1:31:50] employee there, Lord. Don't know who he
[1:31:52] is, but you know who he is, Lord. And
[1:31:54] Father, his wife happens to work with
[1:31:56] believers who sent in a request and here
[1:31:58] we are praying and we're sending prayers
[1:32:00] to MUSC to that man. Lord, may you have
[1:32:04] mercy. I pray on the case. I pray Lord
[1:32:06] for brother Mark that you would bless
[1:32:08] him on this meeting with great abundance
[1:32:11] over above and beyond. Lord, how many
[1:32:13] times have I seen you come on the scene
[1:32:15] for me in these kind of situations? And
[1:32:17] you actually did more than I could even
[1:32:19] think to even ask you to do and you even
[1:32:22] did more than that. Father, I ask that
[1:32:24] it's such a blessing. Show this great
[1:32:26] kindness to your servant, Brother Mark.
[1:32:28] We commit it to you now. And all the
[1:32:30] hands that went up, Lord, all over the
[1:32:32] building, you see every need, Lord.
[1:32:34] Here's my hands again. Father, I have
[1:32:36] great needs in my life. I know of great
[1:32:39] needs in the lives of the saints here
[1:32:40] and I ask for your mercy for us, Lord.
[1:32:43] In coming days, may you help us, Lord
[1:32:45] God, to shine brighter and brighter,
[1:32:48] cleaning up, Lord, wiping off all the
[1:32:50] smuds from our lens that we might be a
[1:32:52] lighthouse.
[1:32:54] Oh, grant it to us, lamb of God. We
[1:32:56] commit it to you, master, in Jesus name.
[1:33:00] Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. You
[1:33:02] love him. Amen. Let's sing some more of
[1:33:04] that just before we go. Create in me.
