[14:33] one of us when we look around in the
[14:35] world that we're living in and we see uh
[14:38] the condition and we see the condition
[14:40] of the people and you know, but when we
[14:43] look, we we must always remember this.
[14:46] If not for God's grace, there we be. If
[14:51] it wasn't for the grace of God tonight,
[14:53] just think of where you might be. Amen.
[14:56] But God rich in mercy.
[14:59] Amen. I'm glad that I serve a God that
[15:01] by nature is merciful.
[15:04] Amen. By nature, you know. So when you
[15:07] when you're asking God to show you
[15:10] mercy, you're not asking him to do
[15:12] something that's against his nature to
[15:15] do because by nature, he is a merciful
[15:18] God. Amen. And and I'm glad that that's
[15:22] the kind of God that we serve tonight.
[15:24] Could we just all bow our heads and look
[15:26] to the Lord in a word of prayer? If you
[15:28] got a special need tonight, why don't
[15:30] you just lift it up to him? And make it
[15:33] known. And how many knows that God sees
[15:36] every heart? He knows every every need.
[15:38] And and let's just lift that up before
[15:41] the throne of grace tonight. Heavenly
[15:43] Father, Lord, we're so thankful, Lord.
[15:45] We count it such an honor and a
[15:47] privilege, Lord, as we stand here
[15:49] tonight and we look at this this
[15:51] audience of of young people, Lord, and
[15:54] realizing, God, that it's not just
[15:56] another group of young people, Lord,
[16:00] that's not another group of teenagers.
[16:02] And Lord, but there this is the the
[16:05] purchase of the blood, Lord. We know,
[16:08] God, that what's standing before us
[16:11] tonight is a is a part of the bride of
[16:13] Jesus Christ. And Lord, when we realize
[16:16] that God, it it just puts such a a
[16:19] burden of responsibility upon us, Lord,
[16:23] that we want to be so careful, Lord, how
[16:25] we would approach, Lord, and how we
[16:27] would speak. And Lord, the things that
[16:29] we would say, God, because we realize,
[16:31] Lord, that we're speaking to a special
[16:33] group of people. And Lord, we just want,
[16:37] Lord, that you would be pleased in all
[16:39] things that are said and done. And we're
[16:41] asking, God, that you would hide us
[16:43] behind the cross. Lord, that you would
[16:46] just put in our mouth, Lord, the very
[16:48] words of life. And Lord, I pray, God,
[16:51] that the things that shouldn't be said,
[16:53] that you would just seal our lips, Lord.
[16:55] But Lord, the things that you desire to
[16:58] be spoken, Lord, I pray, God, that you
[17:00] would speak. And Lord, may it be, God,
[17:02] that your word would be as a flaming
[17:04] fire. And Lord, I pray that the hearts
[17:07] of your children would be as kindling
[17:09] tonight. And Lord, may the fire of the
[17:12] word of God strike the heart of every
[17:14] believer. And Lord, may it set our souls
[17:16] a flame. And Lord, may we all leave here
[17:19] burning, Lord, with the fire of the Holy
[17:22] Spirit in our hearts. Lord, I pray that
[17:24] you'd meet every need. Lord, every
[17:27] request, God, you saw every heart, every
[17:29] hand. Lord, you know the unspoken
[17:31] things. And Lord, we're just praying God
[17:33] that even not just in this service, but
[17:36] in these meetings, Lord, that you would
[17:38] just have your way among us. Lord, I
[17:40] pray God that you'd have preeminence,
[17:42] Lord. We're inviting you to come not to
[17:44] be an onlooker, Lord, or just to sit in
[17:47] the corner, Lord, as a recording angel,
[17:50] but Lord, we want you to be active in
[17:52] the service, Lord. Take an active part
[17:54] in every service, in every meeting, God.
[17:57] Lord, we want you to be the supreme one
[17:59] and we want to recognize your presence,
[18:01] Lord. Just have your way among us now.
[18:04] As we commit ourselves into your hands,
[18:05] we surrender our lives to you. In the
[18:08] name of Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen.
[18:12] Amen. If you'd take your Bibles tonight,
[18:14] we'll just try to get right into the
[18:15] word. And I want you to turn with me to
[18:17] the book of Matthew in the 12th chapter.
[18:19] And while you're turning there, I do
[18:21] want to thank brother Jason, brother
[18:22] Matt, and all the uh minister brothers
[18:25] and you know the local assembly and
[18:27] their invitation to come and be a part
[18:29] of this meeting. We certainly are
[18:31] honored to be able to stand before you
[18:33] and and uh also uh the other minister
[18:36] brothers that are here. Amen. Brother
[18:38] John and and which will be speaking as
[18:41] well and and then uh brother Andrew come
[18:43] and you know just uh take in a service
[18:46] or or two and and uh appreciate that the
[18:49] support and all the minister brothers.
[18:51] We just appreciate each one and uh we're
[18:54] we're we're certainly honored uh to um
[18:58] to be numbered among great men of God
[19:00] and and just you know consider ourselves
[19:03] to be the least uh of all but but
[19:06] nevertheless I I I just pray that God
[19:09] can use us and and uh you know I I'm a
[19:13] I'm the kind of preacher I don't know
[19:15] most of you probably know me. I know
[19:17] I've preached to a bunch of you but uh
[19:19] I'm not scared of any man. So you you
[19:23] don't be scared to say it and and it
[19:25] ain't going it ain't going to bother me
[19:26] a bit. So Amen. matter of fact uh you
[19:29] know I'd be a little bothered if you
[19:31] don't. So Amen. So you just find your
[19:33] liberty tonight. I know what you can do.
[19:36] And I've always said this. You ain't You
[19:38] don't have to beg the bride of Jesus
[19:40] Christ to amen the word. Just preach the
[19:43] word and they'll amen. You don't have to
[19:45] beg her to worship. Just give her a
[19:47] place to do it. That's how you get it.
[19:49] So you got an opportunity tonight. This
[19:51] is your service. Amen. Matthew 12 and
[19:55] verse
[19:57] 43. When the unclean spirit is gone out
[20:00] of a man, he walketh through dry places,
[20:04] seeking rest, and findeth none. Then he
[20:07] saith, I will return into my house from
[20:09] whence I came. And when he is come, he
[20:12] findeth it empty, swept, and garnished.
[20:15] Then he go then goeth he and taketh with
[20:18] himself seven other spirits more wicked
[20:20] than
[20:21] himself. And they enter in and dwell
[20:24] there. And the last state of that man is
[20:27] worse than the first. Even so it will be
[20:30] also unto this wicked generation. May
[20:34] God just add his blessing to the reading
[20:36] of the word. And you can have your seats
[20:37] tonight. It's all right. I'm going to
[20:38] take this off. Just get it right out of
[20:40] the way. Thank you, brother. Amen.
[20:44] I want to speak to you this evening by
[20:47] the help of the Lord for the next few
[20:49] minutes on the strong man of the house.
[20:53] And if I could um maybe have a a little
[20:57] bit of a a point I would like to make is
[21:00] keeping the victory. How many like to
[21:02] have the victory? Amen. You know, but
[21:05] but the thing about it is is is is
[21:08] getting the victory is one thing, but
[21:09] keeping it see that's something else.
[21:12] Amen. You can get a you can get a touch
[21:14] from God, but but we want it to be
[21:17] something that goes beyond just a youth
[21:20] camp. I I want you to be able to leave
[21:23] this youth camp and take something home
[21:24] with you and it lasts not from just camp
[21:28] to camp or revival to revival, but
[21:30] something that's going to stay with you
[21:32] and you're going to keep it. And and so
[21:34] that's what we want to look at tonight.
[21:36] Now, in the message, why some people
[21:38] can't keep the victory. The prophet
[21:41] said, "Now, now the church doesn't need
[21:43] a polishing. It doesn't need a
[21:46] faceelifting. It needs a birth. It needs
[21:49] a conversion." And let me just start by
[21:52] saying this. You ain't never going to
[21:54] keep the victory without being born
[21:56] again. And Jesus come in John chapter 3
[22:00] and he spoke to Nicodemus and he said,
[22:02] he told Nicodemus, "Except a man is born
[22:05] again, he shall not see the kingdom of
[22:07] God. He cannot enter into the kingdom of
[22:09] God." And then he goes on to say,
[22:11] "Marvel not that I've said unto you that
[22:13] you must be born again." And so we know
[22:16] by that that the that Jesus himself,
[22:18] brother Brown would even say it's the
[22:19] first doctrine that Jesus ever taught.
[22:21] You must be born again. And we know by
[22:23] that that Jesus is saying you must. He
[22:26] didn't say, you know, this is a good
[22:27] idea. This is something that if you' do
[22:29] it, you'd be better off. Or you know, if
[22:32] if you'd be born again, then it would
[22:34] really help you in your life. No, he
[22:35] said you must be born again. In other
[22:38] words, it is absolutely necessary. Amen.
[22:41] And essential. Amen. You've got to do
[22:43] it. You must be born again. Amen. So,
[22:46] just bear that in mind tonight. And the
[22:48] prophet of God said, he said, "That's
[22:50] what the church needs." Now, look as he
[22:52] goes on to say, he said, "The Bible said
[22:54] that when an unclean spirit is gone out
[22:56] of a man, he walks in dry places. And
[22:59] when he comes back, he finds it
[23:01] different." Now, here's what's the
[23:02] matter. When an unclean spirit comes
[23:04] back to the old place, the reason that
[23:07] you have your ups and downs is when the
[23:09] unclean spirit goes out, that's just as
[23:12] far as you go. See, you go and you get a
[23:15] new heart or something. Now, what's he
[23:17] talking about there? He's taking it from
[23:19] the scripture, Ezekiel 36, and and how
[23:22] that Ezekiel spoke there uh and and how
[23:25] he laid out the new birth. Brother B
[23:27] would tie it with the new birth and he
[23:29] said that's uh even in that same
[23:31] message, he said it this way. He said,
[23:32] "That's what we need today is an
[23:34] experience of the new birth." And now I
[23:36] want you to watch the order that Ezekiel
[23:39] brought it in. He said, "I'll give you a
[23:40] new heart. I'll give you a new spirit
[23:43] and then I'll put my spirit in you."
[23:46] Now, many times there's been the
[23:48] terrible mistake. The people has thought
[23:51] sometimes that the new spirit was the
[23:54] Holy Spirit, but it isn't. It's a new
[23:56] spirit. And why? You couldn't even get
[23:58] along with yourself with your old
[24:00] spirit. Amen. How you going to get along
[24:03] with the Holy Spirit? Amen. But God gave
[24:05] you a new spirit that you could get
[24:07] along with his spirit. Amen. And we can
[24:10] see in this, brother Bam is showing. He
[24:12] said, watch the order of it. How Ezekiel
[24:15] would lay it out. And watch the order of
[24:16] it. He puts it in three. He said, "God
[24:19] will give you a new heart." Now, Brother
[24:21] B said, "That was the grace of God. It
[24:23] was God's grace to you. He gave you a
[24:25] new heart. He took out the stony heart
[24:27] and gave you a heart of flesh." Why
[24:29] would God do that? because he has to get
[24:31] give you a a new heart so that you can
[24:35] have a heart to receive the word. Amen.
[24:38] Because you got a stony heart. You you
[24:40] were born Amen. Let me just say it to
[24:42] you this way. I don't care what family
[24:44] was born in. I don't care if you're
[24:45] raised in the message. You were born in
[24:47] sin.
[24:49] Amen. You were you were shapen in
[24:51] iniquity. Amen. Amen. You were all born
[24:54] under that same curse. And Amen. And
[24:56] therefore, you must be born again there.
[24:59] That's why, Amen. Jesus would come along
[25:01] and say, "You have to be born again
[25:03] because you were born wrong the first
[25:05] time." Amen. And by nature, you were a
[25:08] sinner. Amen. And you come here with a
[25:10] stony heart. So the first place that God
[25:12] has to start is with your heart. Amen.
[25:15] And so we can see it's the grace of God.
[25:17] He gives you a new heart and then he
[25:19] gives you a new spirit so that you you
[25:21] would have a spirit that would get along
[25:23] with his spirit. The prophet said, he
[25:25] said, "But the mistake that people make
[25:27] is they think that the new spirit is the
[25:29] Holy Spirit." Amen. And that's just as
[25:32] far as they go. But let me just say that
[25:34] we don't we're not here tonight so you
[25:36] can get a new spirit. Amen. But we're
[25:38] here that you can get the Holy Spirit.
[25:41] Amen. Because let me just go on to say
[25:43] this. The the prophet taught us also
[25:45] that we can pick up one another's spirit
[25:48] and you can even get the pastor's spirit
[25:50] and you can get a church spirit and you
[25:52] can Amen. But listen friends, we're not
[25:54] here tonight so you can pick up one
[25:56] another's spirit or that you can Amen.
[25:58] pick up a preacher spirit. Amen. But
[26:00] we're here so that you can get the Holy
[26:03] Spirit. Hallelujah. Because only the
[26:06] Holy Spirit can change your
[26:09] life. Amen. That's just the truth. Now
[26:12] watch. Because Amen. The prophet would
[26:14] go on to say, he said, "Amen, there's
[26:17] three works of of grace. There's
[26:19] justification, sanctification, the
[26:20] baptism of the Holy Ghost, three works
[26:23] of grace. We know that's the three
[26:25] stages or parts of a birth. And then he
[26:28] would say in the message of contest, he
[26:29] said when an unclean spirit is gone out
[26:31] of a man, he walks in dry places.
[26:33] Returning back then, bringing seven
[26:35] other devils with him. And now that goes
[26:38] to show that if the man was clean of the
[26:40] devil. See, then there was something
[26:42] that was in him that now has gone out. A
[26:45] devil has gone out. Amen. Now, when the
[26:47] devil moved out, that gives God an
[26:50] opportunity to move in. Amen. So, when
[26:53] he goes out, let the Holy Spirit come
[26:55] in. Don't just leave it there. See,
[26:58] because if you do, you just repent of
[27:00] your sins and go on, then you're going
[27:02] to be worse off than ever.
[27:05] Now, I mean, you you you're hearing what
[27:07] the prophet is saying. He's saying you
[27:09] be worse off than ever. If you just come
[27:11] to a place of repentance, and that's as
[27:14] far as you go, and you don't Amen. get
[27:17] that place because you can come here
[27:19] tonight and we could cast the devil out
[27:21] of you. The preaching of the word can do
[27:23] that just by the preaching of the word.
[27:25] Amen. You you there can be a work of
[27:27] justification. There can be a work of
[27:29] even sanctification in your life. Amen.
[27:31] And you can be cleaned and a a a and the
[27:34] devil be cast out. But the prophet said
[27:36] if you don't let the Holy Spirit come in
[27:38] and fill that place, he said, see,
[27:42] you'll be worse off than you ever was. I
[27:44] just say this tonight. I believe that's
[27:46] why. Amen. Brother Bannon was against
[27:48] man-made altar calls. Amen. Now, let me
[27:51] make that clear. The prophet was not
[27:53] against altter calls, but he was against
[27:57] man-made altar costs where me just
[28:00] pulled and pulled on on people to come.
[28:03] Amen. Because listen, if if God is not
[28:05] dealing with a heart and I get you up
[28:07] here, Brother Bam would just say it
[28:09] plain and he just said it like he said,
[28:11] you will make them 10 times harder to
[28:13] win to Christ. You know why? Because
[28:16] they'll you'll come to the altar. Amen.
[28:18] And you'll leave, Amen, with the same
[28:21] desire that you came with. And you're
[28:23] always going to be disappointed.
[28:26] You might as well say, "Amen." You come
[28:28] to a place, amen, but you don't get,
[28:30] Amen, that that place, Amen, in you
[28:33] that's cleaned out is not filled with
[28:35] the spirit of God and occupied by the
[28:37] Holy Ghost. Amen. So you just go out and
[28:40] only to fail. Amen. Only to Amen. make
[28:43] another mistake, fall right back in the
[28:45] very thing that you just got out of.
[28:47] Amen. And it just leaves you
[28:49] disappointed.
[28:53] But watch because there's got to be a a
[28:56] a truth of this. He said, "You'll be
[28:58] worse off than ever." But get that place
[29:02] where Satan once lived occupied. Get it
[29:05] filled with the Holy Spirit of God, and
[29:08] then you'll have the strength of God's
[29:10] word in you.
[29:13] How many of you wants to be overcomers?
[29:17] Amen. I I'm asking you, how many desires
[29:19] to be an overcomer?
[29:22] First John 5 and chap uh uh chapter 5
[29:25] verse4. For whatsoever is born of God
[29:29] overcometh the world. And this is the
[29:33] victory that overcomemeth the world,
[29:35] even our
[29:37] faith. Who is he that overcomemeth the
[29:39] world? But he that believeth that Jesus
[29:41] is the son of God, and this is he that
[29:44] came by water and blood, even Jesus
[29:47] Christ, not by water only, but by water
[29:50] and blood. And it's the Spirit that
[29:51] beareth witness, because the Spirit is
[29:54] truth. For there are three that bear
[29:57] record in heaven, the Father, the Word,
[29:59] and the Holy Ghost. And these three are
[30:01] one. And there are three that bear
[30:03] witness in earth, the Spirit, and the
[30:05] water, and the blood. And these three
[30:07] agree in one. Now watch this. says a
[30:10] prophet would pick up that scripture and
[30:11] he says there's three that bear record
[30:13] in heaven. The father, the word which is
[30:16] the son, the word is the son. The
[30:18] father, the word, and the holy ghost.
[30:19] These three are one. There are three
[30:21] that bear record on the earth. The
[30:23] water, the blood, and the spirit. They
[30:24] agree. Amen. In one. They're not one,
[30:26] but they agree in one. Watch. Because
[30:29] you cannot have the father without
[30:32] having the son. And you cannot have the
[30:35] son without having the Holy Ghost
[30:37] because they are one.
[30:40] In other words, can I just say it to you
[30:41] this way tonight? You cannot have Amen.
[30:44] You can't have God without having the
[30:47] word
[30:49] because he said the word is the son.
[30:52] Amen. That's where a lot of people
[30:53] today, everybody says they love Jesus,
[30:55] but they don't love the word.
[30:58] Amen. But I've got some bad news for
[31:00] you. You can say you love Jesus all you
[31:02] want to. If you don't love the word, you
[31:03] don't love him.
[31:07] Because in the beginning was the word
[31:09] and the word was with God and the word
[31:11] was
[31:12] God. If you love Jesus, you love his
[31:16] word. Can you say amen? Amen. And you
[31:19] cannot amen have God without having the
[31:22] word. Amen. Listen friends. How did this
[31:25] Leodysian age put Jesus out of the
[31:27] church? They did not put the nail
[31:30] scarred man. Amen. The man Jesus Christ,
[31:33] they did not run him out of the church.
[31:35] Amen. But they put him out by rejecting
[31:38] the
[31:40] word. And when they rejected the word,
[31:42] they rejected Christ.
[31:46] Hallelujah. Amen. But you, how many can
[31:48] see that on the negative side? To reject
[31:50] the word is to reject Christ. If it's
[31:53] that way in the negative, Amen. then to
[31:56] believe this. To receive the word is to
[31:59] receive Christ.
[32:01] [Applause]
[32:03] Hallelujah. Say, "Brother, how can I
[32:06] receive Christ?" Receive the word.
[32:09] Amen. Can I quote a prophet to you? You
[32:11] are becoming the word as you receive the
[32:14] word.
[32:16] Hallelujah. Amen. How many wants Jesus?
[32:20] Amen. How are you going to receive him?
[32:22] Amen. By receiving his word. Because he
[32:25] is the word.
[32:27] Are you with me so far? Amen. But let me
[32:30] take a little a step further. You can't
[32:32] have God, you can't have the word and
[32:34] not have the spirit.
[32:38] Are are are you understand what I'm
[32:39] saying? You cannot you can't separate
[32:41] it, friends. And that's the problem we
[32:43] have many times. We got some on this
[32:45] side and all they want is the spirit.
[32:47] Oh, they just want the spirit. They they
[32:49] love the move. They love the feeling.
[32:51] They love the all this. Amen. But they
[32:53] don't want the word.
[32:56] Amen. But then on the other side, we got
[32:58] it's just word only. Word only. Word
[33:00] only. But they don't want the
[33:02] spirit. But friends, let me just say
[33:04] this. Jesus said, "My word is spirit and
[33:09] life." You cannot separate the word from
[33:13] the
[33:13] spirit. Or the spirit from the word.
[33:17] Listen friends, we are not here to try
[33:19] to work up emotion. We're not here
[33:20] trying to work up a a sensation. Amen.
[33:23] That's not what it's about. Amen. But we
[33:25] are here to lift up the word.
[33:28] Hallelujah. Amen. And where the word is,
[33:30] there'll be the
[33:32] spirit. There'll be a
[33:35] power because a word comes with power.
[33:39] It comes with demonstration.
[33:42] It's not dead lettering.
[33:44] It's a
[33:46] power. Amen. And the and he's saying
[33:48] these three, these that bear record in
[33:50] heaven, the father, the the the the
[33:52] word, and the spirit, these three are
[33:55] one.
[33:57] And then you have the water, blood, and
[33:58] the spirit. These three agree in
[34:00] one. You can't have the father without
[34:03] having the word. Can't have the word
[34:06] without having the spirit. But brother
[34:08] Brown said, you can be justified and not
[34:11] be
[34:13] sanctified. And you can be sanctified
[34:15] and not have the Holy Ghost.
[34:19] Are are you following me? You can come
[34:21] through a work of
[34:23] grace. Amen. You can come to a place of
[34:27] repentance. You can you can even be uh
[34:30] uh you know you can the word can speak
[34:32] to your heart and you can walk in
[34:34] obedience and be baptized in the name of
[34:36] the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. And and
[34:39] accept that and come to a justified
[34:42] state.
[34:44] But if you stop there, you ain't went
[34:45] far enough.
[34:48] And let me tell you, amen, you will
[34:50] never keep the victory.
[34:53] living in a justified
[34:55] state. You will never keep the victory.
[34:58] Living in a sanctified
[35:00] state, I just feel like preaching
[35:02] tonight and saying this. We are not here
[35:05] for partial
[35:08] births. We not come to see a bunch of
[35:10] stillborn babies. Amen. But we want real
[35:14] true bornag again sons and daughters of
[35:16] God that are quickened to life by the
[35:19] baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[35:22] Hallelujah. That'll put a power in you.
[35:26] That'll make the word
[35:29] [Applause]
[35:30] live. Hallelujah. I tell you what it'll
[35:33] do. It'll bring the words off the Bible.
[35:36] Amen. And make it walk. Hallelujah. Not
[35:39] in your pastor's life. Not in the
[35:42] evangelist's life. Not in the deacon's
[35:44] life. I'm talking about in
[35:48] you. Hallelujah.
[35:51] This message is not just books and
[35:54] tapes. It's not just quotes that we post
[35:57] on our refrigerator. Amen. This message
[36:00] is
[36:01] alive. It's a living
[36:04] reality. The message is Christ.
[36:09] It's got to be Christ in you, a hope of
[36:11] glory which can only come through a
[36:13] birth. Amen. It can only come Amen.
[36:16] Amen. The spirit of God has to come and
[36:18] indwell in you as an
[36:22] individual. Watch what the prophet said.
[36:26] He said, "There's where you Nazarene
[36:28] people failed. You just went far. You
[36:32] went that far." He sum out
[36:34] sanctification. You went that far and
[36:37] you didn't go no
[36:39] further. I just say this. I'm afraid
[36:42] some didn't get that
[36:45] far because sanctification will clean
[36:47] you up.
[36:50] Come on, church. Amen. And and and while
[36:54] I'm right here, I might as well just
[36:55] stay there a minute and tell you Jesus
[36:57] will not live in a dirty house.
[37:02] Come on, church. Jesus will not live in
[37:05] a dirty house.
[37:07] Amen. He's not going to come and live
[37:09] Amen. in a in a in a house full of sin.
[37:13] Amen. The house must be clean.
[37:17] There's got to be a work of
[37:18] sanctification in your life.
[37:23] But the prophet said, "See, the
[37:25] Nazarines come to that
[37:27] place. Many people come to a place of of
[37:31] sanctification." He said, "But see where
[37:33] they made their mistake is they didn't
[37:35] go no further.
[37:37] The vessel is sanctified and on the
[37:39] altar ready for service but not in
[37:42] service. But the Bible says, "Blessed
[37:45] are they that hunger and
[37:48] thirst." Let me just stop here and ask
[37:51] you the qu. How many of you are hungry
[37:54] and thirsty?
[37:56] How many wants Amen. How many of you
[37:58] desire righteousness?
[38:01] Amen. How many of you want the life of
[38:04] Christ living through you? How many have
[38:07] that desire tonight? Amen. Well, I got
[38:09] good news. I got a promise to give you.
[38:12] Blessed are they that hunger and thirst
[38:14] after righteous. They shall be
[38:20] filled. Hallelujah. Amen. They shall.
[38:24] That word shall is not they might be. It
[38:27] might happen. Maybe. Amen. But you
[38:30] shall. If you're hungry tonight, if
[38:33] you're thirsty tonight, there's a
[38:35] promise.
[38:36] Hallelujah. If there's a deep calling,
[38:40] there's got to be a deep to respond to
[38:43] that
[38:47] call. They shall be filled.
[38:52] See the water, the blood, and the
[38:54] spirit. Jesus come to wash and cleanse
[38:56] and sanctify a church that he might come
[38:59] and live in it.
[39:01] He gave his own god-born blood that he
[39:04] might cleanse it from a from our first
[39:06] birth and give us, amen, a sanctified
[39:08] holy vessel that he himself might come.
[39:11] See, a little while the world seeth of
[39:13] me no more, yet ye shall see me because
[39:15] I, amen, and I, as a personal pronoun,
[39:18] will be with you, even in you, even to
[39:20] the end of the consummation. Amen. The
[39:22] works that I do shall you do also, and
[39:24] these signs shall follow them that
[39:26] believe. Amen. God in the church. Oh my
[39:28] deity. Amen. There you are. Amen.
[39:31] There's three that bear record in
[39:32] heaven. The father, the word, and the
[39:34] son. Amen. The father, uh, the word
[39:36] rather, and the holy ghost, they are
[39:38] one. Hallelujah. Amen. There's three
[39:41] that bear record in the earth. Amen. The
[39:43] water, the blood, and the spirit. These
[39:45] three agree in
[39:49] one. Now, watch this. And let me show
[39:53] you. Let me show you a principle. A
[39:56] principle in the word. You can see it
[39:57] clearly in divine healing.
[40:00] Because you know how many uh you know
[40:03] the prophet come and he taught us he
[40:05] taught on demonology and he taught in
[40:07] the physical realm and then there's
[40:09] demonology in the spiritual realm right
[40:12] amen and he would use the physical side
[40:14] to show you amen principles in the
[40:17] spiritual realm and watch this because
[40:21] dealing with uh brother B would talk
[40:22] about cancers and and how that they
[40:25] would attack a body and he would say how
[40:27] that he said the devil is not a
[40:29] creator. How many knows that's true?
[40:33] Amen. Satan only can
[40:35] pervert. Amen. He cannot create. See,
[40:38] only God can do that. But see, then
[40:40] brother B would talk about how do these
[40:41] things come and attack the body like a
[40:44] cancer or so forth. It would be a a cell
[40:47] that would be
[40:49] bruised. In other words, Amen. something
[40:51] there's an injury in the body or
[40:53] something takes place and and and and
[40:54] and then Satan because let me just say
[40:57] this Satan is an opportunist
[41:00] and if Satan's going to hit you, he's
[41:02] going to hit you in the weakest place.
[41:05] Amen. And he's going to we hit you in
[41:06] the weakest time. Come on, church. Amen.
[41:10] And that's when he's going to come and
[41:11] that's where he's going to hit. And
[41:13] brother Brown would even call that sail
[41:15] that sale that's been injured. He would
[41:16] call it a backslid sail.
[41:20] And then amen now life will come and
[41:22] attach itself and then sail upon sail it
[41:26] will begin to
[41:27] build. Is that right? He said what is it
[41:30] doing? He said that br cell alive comes
[41:33] amen of cancer and comes into that and
[41:35] begins to multiply cells and the cancer
[41:38] amen gets bigger and bigger. Amen.
[41:40] What's it doing? Sucking your
[41:42] bloodstream killing you poisoning you
[41:44] and finally it'll get you.
[41:47] He said, "Now, if a doctor can catch it
[41:49] early enough,
[41:51] see, if a doctor can catch it early
[41:53] enough, then he can go in and do a
[41:55] surgery and he can cut the thing out."
[41:57] And he said, "If he can cut all of it
[41:59] and get it all out," he said, "then
[42:01] you're free of it." He said, "But if one
[42:03] little bit of it
[42:04] remains, see, it'll just be it'll just
[42:07] begin to grow
[42:08] again." Amen. And and and I thought
[42:11] about that how that even the in medical
[42:14] science and doctors and so forth they
[42:16] can have such a great success in in in
[42:20] treating amen these diseases if they can
[42:23] catch it in an early stage.
[42:26] And that's why they're constantly, you
[42:28] know, telling people to do
[42:31] self-examinations, you know, uh uh don't
[42:33] wait till you till you're feeling the
[42:35] symptom.
[42:37] Amen. But but you need to be doing
[42:41] self-examinations looking for the
[42:43] problem before it takes root or before
[42:46] it grows to a place amen that it gets
[42:48] out of control.
[42:50] If it's that way in the physical realm,
[42:52] what about in the spiritual realm?
[42:55] I believe we need to constantly do
[42:57] self-examination.
[43:00] Amen. And catch the thing in early
[43:01] stages and then the spirit of God can
[43:04] come and cut the thing out.
[43:08] Are you with me tonight? Let me tell you
[43:10] something. You know how Satan attacks a
[43:12] church the same way he attacks a body.
[43:16] He'll come to somebody in the church
[43:18] that's got their feelings hurt. It's a
[43:21] bruise sale.
[43:23] Amen. Which becomes
[43:24] backslid and that's where he starts.
[43:28] And if you ain't careful, it'll build
[43:30] sail upon sale. Say, how's it do that?
[43:33] Because that backsliding sail will start
[43:35] telling the Amen. you know, go to
[43:37] another sale. Amen. And and what's it
[43:39] doing? It's drawing more strength and
[43:41] growing greater and greater.
[43:47] So you see that the tactics of Satan and
[43:49] now brother Brown said now a doctor if
[43:51] he can catch an early stage, he can cut
[43:53] the thing out.
[43:56] And God can perform a
[44:00] miracle. How many believes God our God
[44:03] is a miracle working God?
[44:06] God can perform a miracle. And if God
[44:08] performs a miracle, the tumor will
[44:10] completely just fall off or disappear.
[44:15] Amen. But but then God also Amen.
[44:19] There's also such a thing as divine
[44:21] healing.
[44:22] Now divine healing is a process.
[44:25] Now that's where the part I want to deal
[44:27] with and show you this principle because
[44:30] brother Brown said somebody will come up
[44:32] and get prayed for. He said, "And God,
[44:35] Amen, will heal them.
[44:38] And you know what'll happen? He'll that
[44:40] Amen. the spirit of God will will will
[44:43] curse the life
[44:45] that is in that tumor." Now, Brother
[44:48] Brown said the tumor is still there.
[44:51] But the life has left it.
[44:54] Amen. But the thing about it is and the
[44:56] person feels
[44:58] better. They feel better.
[45:01] But then in about 72 hours, see three
[45:06] days, what's going to happen? Because a
[45:08] life has left it. Brother Brandon said,
[45:10] "Now corruption is going to set in. But
[45:13] corruption not in the body, but in that
[45:15] cancer because it's dead." And he said,
[45:18] "When it does, it'll begin to swell and
[45:20] the person will feel sick." You can see
[45:23] it clearly. But somebody had a tumor on
[45:26] their eyes. They come up in the prayer
[45:27] line, brother. You know, they'd be
[45:29] prayed for. They're healed. They can
[45:31] see. Amen. They can see. They feel
[45:34] better. They can see. But then three
[45:35] days later, that thing begins to swell.
[45:38] Amen. Their eyesight begins to and and
[45:40] watch. Amen. The prophet of God said,
[45:42] "Amen. When them symptoms begin to come
[45:45] back and they begin to feel bad again."
[45:47] Amen. You know what they do? Satan is
[45:49] right there.
[45:51] He's right there to say you you didn't
[45:54] get your healing. You never was healed.
[45:57] It didn't really happen. And he said if
[46:00] you ain't careful, unbelief will
[46:02] resurrect.
[46:05] The life that was in that
[46:10] cancer. Listen friends, think about it
[46:14] in the spiritual realm now. Because
[46:17] you'll come to a a a youth camp like
[46:19] this or you'll come, you go in a service
[46:21] and you know, you have a good powerful
[46:23] service and spirit of God's moving on
[46:25] you and you come to the altar. Somebody
[46:26] prays over you. You're desiring
[46:28] deliverance. You're desiring uh uh you
[46:30] know, God to help you with a certain
[46:31] thing, whatever it might be. Amen. You
[46:33] come up for prayer. Amen. Somebody
[46:34] agrees with you in prayer. Amen. And you
[46:36] leave there feeling good. You leave
[46:39] there delivered. You leave there, amen,
[46:42] with a victory.
[46:44] But you watch about three days later.
[46:47] Let me tell you, I'm I'm laying
[46:48] something out to you, a principle. Amen.
[46:50] Because a devil's coming back.
[46:54] Amen. I just read it to you right out of
[46:56] the Bible. Amen. When an unclean spirit
[46:58] is cast out of a man, he walketh in dry
[47:01] places. Amen. But he's coming back
[47:05] because, Amen. That spirit that left
[47:08] you, Amen, is looking for a body to
[47:10] inhabit.
[47:14] When and and and that and when Satan
[47:16] comes back, this is the this is the
[47:18] point. If the good man, the strong man,
[47:21] if the good man, brother Ben, we caught
[47:22] the good man of the house is not there.
[47:24] If there's not somebody there to say,
[47:26] "Hey, wait a minute, buddy. You ain't
[47:28] coming back in this house."
[47:31] Amen. No, we you cast we were you were
[47:33] cast out of this house and you ain't
[47:34] coming back in this house. Amen. No,
[47:37] this you're not welcome here no more.
[47:39] You understand what I'm saying? There's
[47:40] got to be a a good man of the house has
[47:42] got to be standing there. Amen. To guard
[47:44] the door of the house.
[47:48] Hallelujah. Amen. Watch this. Because
[47:51] Amen. You can see it in in divine
[47:52] healing. You can see this principle.
[47:54] Amen. Uh because brother Brown says,
[47:56] "See, cuz faith killed it." He said,
[47:59] "But unbelief will resurrect it."
[48:03] Amen. I say this tonight. Amen. Don't
[48:06] let one speck of unbelief drop in your
[48:09] heart.
[48:11] [Applause]
[48:15] Hallelujah. Amen. And when Amen. it
[48:18] returns back, Amen. Let the good man of
[48:20] the house which is faith stand there and
[48:22] say, "Amen. I don't care what it looks
[48:24] like. I don't care what I feel
[48:28] like." Hallelujah. If God touched your
[48:32] body and healed you, I don't care what
[48:34] the symptoms say. Say, "By his
[48:37] stripe, I am
[48:41] healed." I'm not going by what I
[48:45] feel. Not going by the
[48:47] circumstances, not going by what I see.
[48:51] I'm going by God's word.
[48:53] And his word says, "I'm healed."
[48:57] Hallelujah. What about if you're
[48:59] delivered?
[49:00] Amen. Let me just tell you, because
[49:01] you're going to walk out of here and the
[49:03] first little funny feeling that comes,
[49:05] the devil's going to be right there and
[49:07] he's going to say, "Oh, I told I knew
[49:09] you knew it was just there's nothing to
[49:11] that. It was just a workup. You just got
[49:14] a a little sensation. Somebody just got
[49:16] you excited. Somebody talked you into
[49:18] it." Amen. I tell you what you need to
[49:20] do is stand right up toe to toe of that
[49:22] devil and say, "Devil, I don't care what
[49:24] I look like. I don't care how I
[49:27] feel. I know it's
[49:31] real.
[49:34] Hallelujah.
[49:36] [Applause]
[49:37] Hallelujah. God touch
[49:41] me. I've been
[49:44] delivered. Say, "But brother Josh, what
[49:46] am I going to do when I fall?" Get back
[49:51] up. Are you hearing me
[49:55] tonight? You're going to fall. You're
[49:58] going to stumble. You're going to
[50:01] trip. But what are you going to do? Lay
[50:05] there and wallow in it and let the devil
[50:07] put his foot on your neck? I say no.
[50:10] Stand back up.
[50:13] [Applause]
[50:15] Hallelujah. And tell the devil, I'm I'm
[50:20] saved. I'm
[50:22] justified. I'm sanctified.
[50:25] I've been filled with the Holy
[50:29] Ghost. Some of you sitting there
[50:31] thinking, "Preacher, you're trying to
[50:33] tell me to be a hypocrite." I ain't
[50:35] trying to tell you to be a hypocrite,
[50:36] but I am telling you this. You have a
[50:38] positive confession.
[50:41] And some of you saying, "Well, I ain't
[50:42] sure if I got the Holy Ghost or not."
[50:44] Well, I tell you what I do. I start
[50:46] confessing it right now. And I keep
[50:49] confessing
[50:50] [Applause]
[50:52] it until God makes your body. Obey your
[50:59] confession.
[51:01] Hallelujah. Confess you're an overcomer
[51:04] until you are an
[51:07] overcomer. Confess. Hallelujah. That
[51:10] you're delivered until you are
[51:13] delivered.
[51:18] Hallelujah.
[51:20] I ain't talking about a fairy tale. I'm
[51:22] talking about reality.
[51:27] Hallelujah. Let me tell you something.
[51:28] Amen. There's a power of God in this
[51:30] building tonight. Amen. There's a power
[51:32] of God. You don't have to leave the way
[51:34] you came.
[51:36] No, sir. You don't have to leave this
[51:38] camp the way you came. Amen. You can
[51:40] leave. Amen. If I was you, I'd make my
[51:43] mind up right now. Every one of you
[51:46] young people, I'd make my mind up right
[51:48] now. Amen. I am going to leave
[51:50] different. I am going to leave
[51:53] delivered. I am going to leave on
[51:57] fire. I'm going to leave
[52:00] filled.
[52:02] Hallelujah. I will be an overcomer.
[52:07] [Applause]
[52:13] Amen.
[52:15] Watch this. In Mark chapter 11.
[52:19] Amen. Because Jesus now he's coming and
[52:24] he and he and he sees a fig
[52:26] tree. And when Jesus sees this fig tree,
[52:30] he's he's
[52:31] hungry. A and he desired that he eat
[52:35] fruit of this tree, but there was no
[52:36] fruit on
[52:38] it. And Jesus cursed the tree.
[52:44] And and
[52:45] then the next
[52:47] day as they were passing by his his
[52:50] disciples were they marveled how how
[52:53] quickly that the tree had died and
[52:55] withered and and they marveled at this
[52:57] and and that's where Jesus told him said
[52:59] have faith in God. He said if you say
[53:02] this mountain be and believe in your
[53:04] heart if you Amen. This is Mark 11 I'm
[53:06] talking about. And the and the events
[53:08] preceding Mark 11:22 was Jesus coming to
[53:11] this fig tree and desiring to eat fruit
[53:13] off of there's no fruit on he cursed the
[53:15] tree. But but watch this because brother
[53:18] Brandham takes that scripture and he
[53:19] shows something. It's so powerful
[53:21] because brother Bam would show he said
[53:24] Jesus cursed that tree from the
[53:28] roots. He said an hour later he said
[53:31] when Jesus spoke them words nothing
[53:32] changed on that tree.
[53:35] The leaves were still on the tree. The
[53:37] bark was still on the tree. Nothing
[53:39] happened to the tree that they could see
[53:42] visibly. None. The leaves didn't fall
[53:44] off immediately. Brother said,
[53:46] "Lightning didn't strike the tree and
[53:48] burn it up. The earth didn't open up and
[53:50] swallow it up." He said, "God could have
[53:51] done all that, but he didn't." Jesus
[53:54] just cursed. And he said, "What did he
[53:55] do? He cursed the life that was in the
[53:57] tree and the tree started dying from the
[54:00] roots."
[54:03] Amen. But let me just say this. That
[54:06] tree was dead the minute Jesus spoke
[54:08] them words.
[54:11] That tree was absolutely dead as soon
[54:14] words come out of Jesus's mouth. And he
[54:16] cursed that tree. That tree was dead.
[54:21] Let me tell you, let me show you the the
[54:23] difference between God and Satan.
[54:25] Because Satan's trying to destroy the
[54:27] bride tree,
[54:29] but he's doing it from the outside in.
[54:32] And he's trying to destroy the tree by
[54:34] eating the fruit and eating the leaves
[54:37] and eating the bark. But brother Brown
[54:39] said he forgot that life was in the
[54:44] roots.
[54:45] Hallelujah. He shows a type in Christ.
[54:50] He said they that Roman bug got on the
[54:54] tree and he ate it down to nothing but a
[54:57] stump. But there was life in the
[55:00] roots and God said, "I will restore."
[55:05] Hallelujah. Let me encourage you with
[55:08] this tonight. Amen. Amen. Satan might
[55:10] been gnawing on your fruit, gnawing on
[55:12] your leaves, gnawing on your bark, and
[55:14] he might have you eat down to next to
[55:15] nothing. But if you belong to Jesus
[55:20] Christ, if there is a seed of
[55:23] life in you
[55:27] tonight, then there is a hope of
[55:31] [Applause]
[55:33] restoration. All you need is to get in
[55:36] the right
[55:38] atmosphere.
[55:40] Hallelujah. And watch the light begin to
[55:43] grow up in that tree.
[55:47] Hallelujah.
[55:49] Amen. Amen. But watch this. Amen. Jesus,
[55:53] his tactics was completely opposite of
[55:55] Satan's.
[55:57] When he got ready to destroy the tree,
[56:00] he didn't do it from the outside in.
[56:03] He did it from the inside out.
[56:06] And when Jesus gets ready to change your
[56:08] life, he don't do it from the outside
[56:11] in.
[56:13] He does it from the inside out.
[56:18] Glory to
[56:19] God.
[56:21] Hallelujah. That's why we're not here
[56:24] tonight to try to reform a group of
[56:27] young
[56:29] people. We're here to get you to
[56:32] Christ and let a work of
[56:34] restoration come in your life. Quicking
[56:37] power, transforming power, not from the
[56:40] outside in, from the inside out.
[56:45] Glory to God. You ought to leave this
[56:46] camp singing. It's Jesus on the inside.
[56:49] He's working on the outside. Oh, what a
[56:52] change in my
[56:55] life. It's the Holy Ghost on the
[57:00] [Applause]
[57:01] inside. Hallelujah.
[57:04] Friends, I'm telling you this tonight. I
[57:06] want you to understand this. Amen. This
[57:09] is why people can't keep the victory
[57:11] because we got a lot of people trying to
[57:13] live a Christian life and they don't
[57:15] have the Holy Ghost. They don't have the
[57:18] lifegiver on the inside. Amen. They do
[57:20] not have listen. They never been born
[57:23] again. And you will never live a
[57:25] victorious Christian life. You can't do
[57:28] it,
[57:31] but he can.
[57:35] Hallelujah.
[57:39] I might as well say it
[57:41] [Applause]
[57:42] tonight. These people walk away from
[57:44] this message because they say, "You
[57:46] can't live it. I can't live it. It's too
[57:49] many It's too many dos and don'ts in the
[57:51] message. It's too many rules and I can't
[57:53] live it." And you know what? You can't
[57:55] live it.
[57:58] But he can.
[58:05] And this message ain't dos and don'ts.
[58:09] It's a living reality of a living God.
[58:16] Hallelujah. I just say this. I say it to
[58:19] the critics. I say it to every critic
[58:21] tonight. Amen. You take any group of
[58:23] young people on this planet. Amen. I
[58:26] challenge you to do it. Amen. Amen. And
[58:28] bring them along aside. Amen. what this
[58:30] message will produce.
[58:33] Come on, church. Amen. They can say what
[58:35] they want to about our message. Oh, the
[58:37] message is this and the message is that
[58:39] and it failed here and it failed there.
[58:40] I tell you what this message will do.
[58:42] It'll take Amen. young ladies and have
[58:45] them dress like Christians looking like
[58:48] oh come on in modest apparel. Amen. Boys
[58:51] actually look like
[58:53] [Applause]
[58:56] boys and girls actually look like girls.
[59:02] Right in the middle of Satan's
[59:07] eating in the most perverted age in the
[59:11] most perverted
[59:14] time. Hallelujah. I tell you what, I
[59:17] hate to be standing there in that day.
[59:19] Amen. I can hear the words of Jesus
[59:21] ringing in my ear tonight. Amen. Amen.
[59:23] Because he talked about the queen, amen,
[59:25] of the south and how she had rise up in
[59:28] the judgment against that generation.
[59:30] Amen. Because she heard, amen, of the
[59:32] wisdom of Solomon, amen. And he said,
[59:34] "And a greater than Solomon is hit."
[59:41] And I think about in the judgment, a
[59:43] bunch of Amen. Uhhuh. self-righteous
[59:46] church members stand in the judgment.
[59:48] Amen. standing there and say, "Amen, but
[59:50] you don't understand the age I lived in
[59:52] and you don't understand the pressures
[59:53] of the time and you don't understand."
[59:55] Everybody was doing it and all the women
[59:57] was cutting their hair and they all was
[59:58] wearing makeup and they all was wear
[1:00:01] amen wearing them high heels and they
[1:00:02] was all Amen. dressing in that kind of
[1:00:04] way. Amen. And I can just see God say,
[1:00:07] "Come here." Amen. Come here. One of you
[1:00:09] young people, come here. Amen. Come
[1:00:10] stand up right here. Amen. And God say,
[1:00:12] "Amen. Look right here. Here was a boy."
[1:00:15] Amen. Just a teenager. He lived in the
[1:00:17] same age you lived in.
[1:00:21] Hallelujah.
[1:00:25] He did it.
[1:00:30] Now, where's your excuse?
[1:00:34] Hallelujah.
[1:00:35] One of you young sisters, come up here
[1:00:37] right quick. Somebody you that's all
[1:00:39] right. Right here. Amen. Could you
[1:00:40] imagine? Amen. So, and God says, "Come
[1:00:42] here, young lady." Amen. Let me just
[1:00:44] show Amen. Listen. She did it. Where's
[1:00:47] your excuse? She did it. Amen. She She
[1:00:51] lived an overcoming life in the middle
[1:00:53] of Leosa, right in the middle of Satan.
[1:00:56] She did
[1:00:57] [Applause]
[1:01:00] it.
[1:01:02] Hallelujah. You want to know
[1:01:06] how? Not cuz she was raised in a better
[1:01:09] family. Not because he was raised in a
[1:01:11] better family. Not because of your last
[1:01:14] name. is because greater is he that is
[1:01:19] in
[1:01:19] [Applause]
[1:01:23] you than he that is in the
[1:01:29] world.
[1:01:30] Hallelujah. It's the power of the Holy
[1:01:37] Ghost. I ain't talking about a shout. I
[1:01:40] ain't talking about a dance, brother. I
[1:01:42] believe in shouting. I believe in
[1:01:44] destin. I believe in all those things.
[1:01:46] But I tell you what I'm talking about.
[1:01:48] I'm talking about an overcoming
[1:01:51] life. I'm talking about a power that'll
[1:01:54] change you.
[1:01:57] It'll save you. And brother, it's not
[1:02:00] just that. It'll keep you.
[1:02:03] It'll hold you.
[1:02:10] Hallelujah.
[1:02:12] Hallelujah.
[1:02:16] It's Jesus. He's working on the inside.
[1:02:18] Amen. Watch what he done. He cursed that
[1:02:20] tree. Amen. And watch. Amen. He killed
[1:02:22] it from the roots.
[1:02:26] Brother, as soon as he spoke, brother
[1:02:27] John, as soon as he spoke, it was over.
[1:02:32] And brother, he said even an hour later,
[1:02:35] the leaves looked the same.
[1:02:39] But brother diggs. Amen. Eventually
[1:02:43] the outside was going to catch up with
[1:02:46] the inside.
[1:02:50] Come on, church. Amen. You can't be
[1:02:52] changed on the inside and not affect the
[1:02:54] outside.
[1:02:56] Amen. You ever get a change in your
[1:02:58] soul, I tell you what it'll do. It'll
[1:03:00] reach out to your
[1:03:02] spirit and it'll reach out to the flesh
[1:03:07] and it'll begin to conquer the flesh.
[1:03:10] [Applause]
[1:03:12] Hallelujah. Amen. And you will become an
[1:03:15] overcomer.
[1:03:17] Amen. Because the outside, amen, will
[1:03:20] begin to manifest. Amen. what is on the
[1:03:22] inside.
[1:03:26] By the next day, they walked back by
[1:03:29] that tree and it was withered and the
[1:03:32] leaves were falling
[1:03:33] off. You know, I feel I I want to stop
[1:03:36] right here and just say something
[1:03:37] because brother Brandon said he talked
[1:03:39] about an oak tree because I want you to
[1:03:42] understand
[1:03:43] something. Everybody's process ain't
[1:03:45] exactly the
[1:03:46] same. Amen. And sometimes some of y'all,
[1:03:50] I mean, it could all happen in one
[1:03:52] night.
[1:03:54] And others, amen, it's a process and
[1:03:57] you're growing in grace from from grace
[1:04:00] to grace. Amen. And God is working and
[1:04:03] dealing and and changing you and Amen.
[1:04:05] And and and the thing about it is, but
[1:04:07] brother Brown taught about that old oak
[1:04:08] tree. He said he said, "You know, them
[1:04:10] oaks will hold on to the leaves all
[1:04:12] winter
[1:04:14] long. Them old dead leaves, they dead as
[1:04:16] they can be." But he said that tree will
[1:04:17] hold on to it. He said, you know, but
[1:04:20] come the spring of the year, you don't
[1:04:22] have to go out there and pick them dead
[1:04:23] leaves off.
[1:04:25] You ain't got to go get you a ladder and
[1:04:26] climb up there and pull all the dead
[1:04:27] leaves off so new leaves can come on. He
[1:04:30] said, just let new life,
[1:04:33] just let new life come. And when that
[1:04:35] life begins to come up from the roots of
[1:04:37] that tree, it begins to push out in the
[1:04:40] limbs. It begins to push out and them
[1:04:42] green leaves be and brother when that
[1:04:44] new life begins to push
[1:04:47] out all them dead
[1:04:50] things begin to fall
[1:04:53] off.
[1:04:55] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. That's what'll
[1:04:58] change you. Let the new life of the Holy
[1:05:02] Ghost begin to flow through you. All the
[1:05:05] dead things of the world will begin to
[1:05:07] fall off.
[1:05:13] Hallelujah. It's transforming power.
[1:05:17] [Applause]
[1:05:18] Glory to God. I asked that brother how
[1:05:22] long I should preach and and so I'm
[1:05:25] trying to I'm I got a long ways to go.
[1:05:28] Praise God.
[1:05:30] Amen. But watch this because the prophet
[1:05:34] says he says remember he said I've
[1:05:37] warned every one of you in 72 hours what
[1:05:40] would take place. The Bible says the
[1:05:41] unclean spirit going out of a mount he
[1:05:43] walks in dry places returns again. Is
[1:05:45] that right? Seven other devils worse
[1:05:48] than he was. See be careful there and
[1:05:51] let the good man of the house be
[1:05:53] standing
[1:05:54] there. Amen. with faith waring him away,
[1:05:58] telling him he can't come. See, refuse
[1:06:01] to see it. Refuse to have it or anything
[1:06:06] else. You just stay right there with it.
[1:06:09] Now, let me just put this scripture in
[1:06:12] because James said, "Submit yourself
[1:06:15] therefore to God.
[1:06:18] Resist the devil
[1:06:21] and he'll flee from you.
[1:06:25] Well, watch that scripture. Submit
[1:06:27] yourself, therefore, to God. There's two
[1:06:28] parts of it. That's right. You got to
[1:06:30] submit yourself to God. Submit yourself
[1:06:33] to his word. Yield to the to the to the
[1:06:37] spirit of God. Amen. Come under the
[1:06:39] authority of the word of God. Amen.
[1:06:41] Allow amen that word to Amen. have
[1:06:44] preeminence in your life.
[1:06:46] Submit yourself to God. Resist the devil
[1:06:51] and he'll flee from you.
[1:06:54] How many believe this Bible is the
[1:06:56] infallible word of God?
[1:06:59] How many believe that heaven and earth
[1:07:00] will pass away but this word will never
[1:07:02] fail? How many believe it's full of
[1:07:04] promises?
[1:07:06] How many will say them promises belong
[1:07:07] to me?
[1:07:09] Amen. How many of you can receive the
[1:07:11] promise of salvation?
[1:07:13] How many receive the promise of healing?
[1:07:15] Amen. All these great promises. Well,
[1:07:16] that's a promise too. Resist the devil
[1:07:20] and he will flee.
[1:07:30] I'm just going to tell you this tonight.
[1:07:32] The trouble with too many of us is we're
[1:07:34] not resisting the devil.
[1:07:37] That word resist means to set yourself
[1:07:39] against.
[1:07:42] Amen. Set yourself against.
[1:07:44] Listen. What are you going to do
[1:07:46] tomorrow when the devil comes to you and
[1:07:48] he starts trying to talk in your ear?
[1:07:50] You're going to sit there and listen.
[1:07:52] Yes, sir. I'm ask you, are you going to
[1:07:54] just accept it? Are you just going to
[1:07:56] say, "Well, that's just the way things
[1:07:58] are." Listen, friends, that's the
[1:07:59] problem we got. Too many people are
[1:08:01] sitting in the church and they're just
[1:08:03] saying, "That's just the way things
[1:08:04] are."
[1:08:06] You know, it's just the age we live in.
[1:08:09] It's just the spirit of the age. It's
[1:08:11] just the time we're living in. Amen. And
[1:08:14] if you keep going down that road,
[1:08:15] floating down the stream, ain't no
[1:08:17] telling where you're going to end up.
[1:08:19] and every spirit out of hell will attach
[1:08:22] itself to you. But I tell you what to
[1:08:24] do. Stand up in faith and resist the
[1:08:29] devil. Set yourself against
[1:08:33] it. Hallelujah. And my Bible says he
[1:08:37] will flee.
[1:08:42] Hallelujah.
[1:08:47] Let me try to hit another scripture here
[1:08:50] before we close. Luke chapter
[1:08:53] 11 verse
[1:08:57] 21. When a strong man
[1:09:00] armed keepeth his
[1:09:02] palace, his goods are in peace.
[1:09:08] But when a stronger than he shall come
[1:09:10] upon him and overcome him, he taketh
[1:09:13] from him all his armor, wherein he has
[1:09:16] trusted and divideth his fools. Now
[1:09:19] watch this because here again, we have a
[1:09:22] principle set in the word of God because
[1:09:24] here's a strong man and and there's
[1:09:27] different ways we could apply this
[1:09:28] tonight, but I'm going I got a quote
[1:09:30] here and and and and I'm going to make a
[1:09:33] I'm going to show you something as a
[1:09:35] principle because now here, Amen. The
[1:09:38] Bible is speaking of a strong man. Now,
[1:09:39] I'm just going to say this.
[1:09:41] Satan is a strong
[1:09:44] man. And Satan has a lot of strongholds.
[1:09:50] And even some of you sitting here
[1:09:52] tonight, Satan may have a stronghold in
[1:09:55] your life.
[1:09:58] And he's sitting there as a strong
[1:10:01] man and and and in your in your life.
[1:10:05] He's got a stronghold in your life. But
[1:10:06] now watch the Bible because when when
[1:10:08] when the strong man is armed and and he
[1:10:11] keepeth his palace, his goods are in
[1:10:14] peace. But when a stronger,
[1:10:19] when a stronger than he shall
[1:10:22] come,
[1:10:24] Hallelujah. I'm just going to use the
[1:10:26] scripture in this way tonight and show
[1:10:28] you this because there's one stronger
[1:10:29] than the devil.
[1:10:34] Amen. Let me just use a quote to back up
[1:10:35] what I'm saying. Anointed ones at the
[1:10:37] end time. He said, "God alone can cast
[1:10:39] out the devil." We know that. God alone.
[1:10:41] For the strong man has to be stronger
[1:10:44] than the one that is in the house.
[1:10:48] Hallelujah. So if the devil is in your
[1:10:50] house as a strong man, the only way that
[1:10:53] you can be free of that is somebody
[1:10:56] stronger
[1:11:00] has got to come
[1:11:01] by. But I got good news for
[1:11:05] you. God is stronger than the devil.
[1:11:11] The power of God is greater than the
[1:11:15] power of the devil.
[1:11:18] Hallelujah.
[1:11:19] Amen. Can you believe that tonight?
[1:11:23] Let me do Let me put it in another way
[1:11:25] that maybe can help you understand, you
[1:11:27] know, because the only Let's just say
[1:11:29] this. Let's just say there's a man and
[1:11:30] he's setting traps and and and and let's
[1:11:34] say he's after raccoons. We'll just use
[1:11:35] that. And he and and he's setting traps,
[1:11:37] you know, and he's got traps and and
[1:11:39] this and this animal gets caught in a
[1:11:41] trap. Now, the only hope that that
[1:11:46] animal has because see that animal is
[1:11:50] caught in a trap that he cannot free
[1:11:52] himself
[1:11:54] from. I mean, you know, some of them
[1:11:56] gnaw their legs off and things like that
[1:11:58] and you know, but but but they don't
[1:12:00] have the ability to set themselves
[1:12:03] free. You are you following me? And see,
[1:12:06] the devil's setting traps for
[1:12:09] you. A and and and you don't have the
[1:12:12] ability to free yourself. And the only
[1:12:14] hope that animal has is a higher
[1:12:17] species. Amen. A greater intelligence.
[1:12:20] Somebody of a Amen. can come along and
[1:12:22] and see them in their in their desperate
[1:12:25] need. Amen. and and set them free. See,
[1:12:29] that's what it takes. Amen. There's got
[1:12:31] to be something greater, amen, to come
[1:12:34] along and set them
[1:12:36] free. Amen. And if the strong man is in
[1:12:39] your house and the devil has a
[1:12:41] stronghold in your house, the only hope
[1:12:44] you have is that a stronger one can
[1:12:47] come.
[1:12:49] Hallelujah. Amen. But as I said, Amen.
[1:12:52] God is stronger than the devil. Yes,
[1:12:56] sir.
[1:13:00] Can I prove it to you by the word of
[1:13:02] God? Can I just prove it to you by the
[1:13:04] Bible? Because how many knows that the
[1:13:06] battle actually started in heaven?
[1:13:09] The battle started in heaven. And
[1:13:11] Michael and his angels fought against
[1:13:13] Lucifer and his angels. Amen. But the
[1:13:16] Bible says, Amen, that Michael kicked
[1:13:19] him out of heaven.
[1:13:22] Can you say amen? And brother Brown said
[1:13:25] the battle that was in heaven which was
[1:13:27] a battle of angels came down to the
[1:13:30] earth
[1:13:31] and now the battle of angels become
[1:13:33] human battles. And he says it come in
[1:13:36] the in the battleground your mind's been
[1:13:37] raging ever since. Is that right? Is
[1:13:40] everybody following me so far? Amen. But
[1:13:42] but the principle I want you to see is
[1:13:44] this that Jesus met Satan on the
[1:13:48] battlegrounds or I should say Michael
[1:13:51] met Satan on the battlegrounds in
[1:13:53] heaven. God and Satan come and met in a
[1:13:57] battle. Who won?
[1:14:01] I'm asking you the question. Who won?
[1:14:03] This ain't a trick question. You can
[1:14:04] answer it. Who won?
[1:14:07] God.
[1:14:08] Amen. Watch now because let's bring it
[1:14:10] down to the earth. Now
[1:14:12] Jesus comes to the earth and takes on
[1:14:17] flesh. The Bible says that he was led
[1:14:19] away in the wilderness to be tempted of
[1:14:21] Satan. Right here they met again on the
[1:14:25] battlegrounds, not in heaven, on the
[1:14:27] earth.
[1:14:29] Who won?
[1:14:34] Now I'm going to show you something real
[1:14:36] powerful. Because brother Brown said on
[1:14:38] that battleground, he didn't even use
[1:14:39] supernatural power
[1:14:42] to defeat the enemy.
[1:14:45] He used the word alone
[1:14:48] to show you
[1:14:53] that you
[1:14:54] [Applause]
[1:14:58] also.
[1:15:00] Hallelujah. Let me say this with the
[1:15:03] authority. Amen.
[1:15:05] The word of God will defeat Satan
[1:15:08] on any grounds,
[1:15:10] [Applause]
[1:15:12] anywhere,
[1:15:17] anytime.
[1:15:19] Hallelujah. And that ain't the end of
[1:15:21] the
[1:15:23] story. Jesus died on Calvary. They laid
[1:15:27] his body in the grave. Amen. His He
[1:15:30] Amen. descended down into hell.
[1:15:34] Amen. He went right down into hell. And
[1:15:36] when he got there, Amen. he met Satan
[1:15:39] again.
[1:15:41] Who won?
[1:15:47] Hallelujah. Who
[1:15:49] won? He jerked the door off of
[1:15:52] hell. He ripped the
[1:15:54] keys off of Satan's neck.
[1:15:59] And he rose on the third day for your
[1:16:04] justification. Hallelujah. As a mighty
[1:16:10] conqueror. My God defeated Satan in
[1:16:13] heaven. He defeated Satan on earth. He
[1:16:17] defeated Satan in hell.
[1:16:20] And that God will defeat Satan in your
[1:16:24] heart, in your life, in your home.
[1:16:30] Hallelujah. I don't care where God meets
[1:16:34] Satan on any
[1:16:36] battleground. He
[1:16:38] always comes out on top.
[1:16:42] [Applause]
[1:16:44] Hallelujah. I want you to understand
[1:16:46] something tonight. Amen. How many I
[1:16:49] asked you earlier. I'm going to ask you
[1:16:50] again. How many wants to be an
[1:16:52] overcomer? How many wants to be an
[1:16:54] overcomer? This is overcoming.
[1:16:57] Recognizing Satan and all of his
[1:17:01] tactics. Brother Ram said, "You must
[1:17:03] first realize that Satan is real and he
[1:17:07] is against you." Come on, church. Young
[1:17:09] people, I want you to understand. Amen.
[1:17:11] Don't you listen to this world out here.
[1:17:13] They'll tell you there ain't no real
[1:17:14] devil and there ain't no real hell and
[1:17:16] there ain't no real God and there ain't
[1:17:17] no real Let me tell you something. There
[1:17:19] is a real devil.
[1:17:21] Amen. He is real and he is not your
[1:17:24] friend. He is your enemy.
[1:17:27] He is against you. And you got to
[1:17:30] recognize Satan and know that he's real
[1:17:33] and know he's against you. But that's
[1:17:35] only half of
[1:17:37] it. And then
[1:17:39] realize that greater is he
[1:17:43] that is in
[1:17:48] you than he that is in the world.
[1:17:56] Let me tell you this
[1:17:57] tonight. You by yourself are not able.
[1:18:01] You're no match for the devil. You
[1:18:04] cannot defeat the devil by yourself.
[1:18:07] Amen. But that's why greater is he.
[1:18:10] That's Listen. God did not ask you to
[1:18:13] fight this battle alone.
[1:18:19] Let me let me bring this to a close. I I
[1:18:23] got I got pages upon pages. But but let
[1:18:26] me just end it with this. Brother Bam,
[1:18:28] in the message, How can I
[1:18:30] overcome? Brother Bam actually takes a
[1:18:32] the scripture that I use as a text
[1:18:35] tonight. And and he begins to say,
[1:18:37] watch. He said, because we're living in
[1:18:39] the age of the literal
[1:18:42] life of Jesus Christ. Listen to me.
[1:18:46] Listen to me, church. You're living in
[1:18:48] the token
[1:18:50] age that you you you can't Amen. Listen.
[1:18:54] Amen. Luther's age, they had their
[1:18:56] message. They were sealed under their
[1:18:58] message. Wesley's age, they had their
[1:18:59] message. It was a And what did that
[1:19:01] message do? Listen, friends.
[1:19:04] Justification was not a doctrine in
[1:19:05] Luther Luther's age. It was it was a
[1:19:08] Amen. When justification be to be
[1:19:10] preached and the revelation of the word
[1:19:12] of God began to be released, Amen. What
[1:19:14] did it do? It produced a justified
[1:19:17] life in the
[1:19:19] people. Sanctification was not just a
[1:19:22] doctrine. Amen. Wesley begin to preach
[1:19:24] the the revelation, the message of the
[1:19:26] hour. Amen. Of power was released and it
[1:19:29] produced sanctification in the lives of
[1:19:31] the people,
[1:19:34] restoration of the gifts, same thing on
[1:19:36] down. But now we're living in the token
[1:19:38] age.
[1:19:39] And friends, it's not a doctrine. It's
[1:19:41] not it's not just something, you know,
[1:19:43] uh some kind of some kind of uh theory
[1:19:45] or a new thing or some kind of doctrine
[1:19:47] we're trying to get you to come to.
[1:19:49] Amen. But when the message of the hour
[1:19:50] is preached, what's it going to do? It's
[1:19:52] going to produce a life
[1:19:55] in a
[1:19:58] people. And brother B says, see, this is
[1:20:01] the age we're living in. It's the age of
[1:20:03] the literal life of Jesus Christ. and
[1:20:05] watch because he starts laying out a
[1:20:07] principle and he says see Luther's age
[1:20:10] justifications Wesley's age
[1:20:11] sanctification he said he said but see
[1:20:15] he said that come now we've come to the
[1:20:17] place he said because sanctification
[1:20:19] don't put you in service it only cleans
[1:20:21] you and sets you aside for service he
[1:20:24] said the Holy Spirit puts you in service
[1:20:27] he said and and and he said
[1:20:29] justification didn't put him in
[1:20:31] sanctification didn't put him in he said
[1:20:34] it come now to where now the that Christ
[1:20:36] is coming into his church and then
[1:20:38] brother Brown said watch it was in that
[1:20:39] leodysian age the only age that now he's
[1:20:42] put out of the church and and he's
[1:20:44] making a point he had to be in to be be
[1:20:47] put out he said and it come to the to
[1:20:50] the literal life the age of the Holy
[1:20:52] Ghost itself coming into the people and
[1:20:55] now they have rejected because he's
[1:20:56] shown himself Jesus Christ the same
[1:20:58] yesterday today and forever and he said
[1:21:01] because he said they don't want to be
[1:21:03] identified with it. He said, "Watch." He
[1:21:06] said, "They're so scared of it, they
[1:21:07] won't even say Holy Ghost." They'll say,
[1:21:09] "Holy Spirit." They won't say Holy Ghost
[1:21:10] because they're so afraid they'll be
[1:21:12] identified with Pentecost. They're so
[1:21:13] afraid they're going to be
[1:21:15] ident. Amen. People are afraid to even
[1:21:18] even be worshiping in the house of God
[1:21:20] or be, you know, afraid of things like
[1:21:23] somebody's going to label me. I'm
[1:21:24] Pentecostal. Let me just tell you right
[1:21:26] now, I am Pentecost.
[1:21:30] Somebody Somebody, you know, man, you
[1:21:32] you shouldn't say that. And amen. I Let
[1:21:34] me just tell you, I'll say it again. I
[1:21:35] am Pentecostal.
[1:21:39] Not Isuzu Street, not Pentecostal age,
[1:21:41] not I ain't talking about
[1:21:43] Pentecostalism.
[1:21:44] I'm talking about hacks
[1:21:48] to the original.
[1:21:51] [Applause]
[1:21:54] Hallelujah. And I ain't ashamed of it.
[1:21:59] Can I just quote a prophet of God 1965
[1:22:02] invisible union? He says she don't want
[1:22:04] talking about the church, the modern
[1:22:06] church. She don't want none of them
[1:22:08] miserable creatures that she thinks they
[1:22:10] are screaming, hollering, tongue
[1:22:12] talking. Amen. Acts 2:38, children, but
[1:22:16] it's the only kind that the word can
[1:22:23] produce.
[1:22:25] Hallelujah. And I am glad to say
[1:22:28] tonight, I am one of them.
[1:22:33] Hallelujah. Is anybody want to join me
[1:22:35] in that? I said, I am one of
[1:22:39] them. Say, brother, what are you talking
[1:22:41] about? I'm talking about one of them.
[1:22:44] saved,
[1:22:46] justified,
[1:22:48] sanctified, Holy Ghost filled, devil
[1:22:51] stomping,
[1:22:53] fire
[1:22:55] breathing, children of the most high
[1:22:58] God. Hallelujah. That's who you
[1:23:03] are. That's overcoming
[1:23:05] power. Hallelujah. And when the strong
[1:23:08] man is in the house, Amen. Greater is he
[1:23:12] that is in
[1:23:14] you. Hallelujah. When the devil comes
[1:23:17] back, I got bad news for the devil.
[1:23:20] Another king has occupied the throne of
[1:23:24] my
[1:23:27] heart. The sea ain't
[1:23:31] empty. The house is not empty. But the
[1:23:35] house is occupied.
[1:23:40] You know what that's telling the devil?
[1:23:41] I'm sorry, devil. There ain't no room
[1:23:44] for you here.
[1:23:47] Hallelujah. Friends, I'm telling you
[1:23:49] this tonight. Amen. You ought to tell
[1:23:51] the devil, devil, ain't no room for you
[1:23:52] in my house. Ain't no room in my in my
[1:23:56] bedroom. Ain't no room, Amen. in our
[1:23:58] church.
[1:24:00] Come on, y'all. Help me tonight. Let's
[1:24:02] tell the devil right now. Devil, you
[1:24:04] ain't welcome in this camp.
[1:24:12] You ain't welcome in these services.
[1:24:16] No,
[1:24:17] devil. There ain't no room for you
[1:24:21] here. Because in this camp, Christ is
[1:24:25] here. The Holy Ghost is here. The angels
[1:24:29] of God are here. Healing is here.
[1:24:33] Deliverance is here. The power of change
[1:24:37] is here
[1:24:38] [Applause]
[1:24:40] tonight. And devil, there ain't no room.
[1:24:47] Hallelujah. As a musicians, we come
[1:24:49] tonight. Amen. Because brother Brown's
[1:24:51] bringing that down. How can I overcome?
[1:24:53] He's bringing it down and he's showing.
[1:24:56] He said, see, he said, but when Christ
[1:24:58] begins to show himself alive, he begins
[1:25:02] to come in, he said, watch. He said, he
[1:25:06] said they put him
[1:25:08] out. If y'all don't mind, I I I'm having
[1:25:11] to I'll have to find it, but I'm going
[1:25:12] to try to find it.
[1:25:15] And the and the prophet
[1:25:17] says he says
[1:25:20] see he
[1:25:23] says come down that le ought to see an
[1:25:26] age after he had received the Holy Ghost
[1:25:28] with the knowledge of the spirit of God
[1:25:29] within it and then
[1:25:32] deny the very works of God and call it
[1:25:35] an evil work.
[1:25:41] And brother Brown said they put Christ
[1:25:42] on the outside of the
[1:25:46] church. He said, "Now we see these hours
[1:25:49] that we're living in this
[1:25:50] state and and we see what it was and the
[1:25:53] Holy Ghost is rebuking the age that put
[1:25:56] him out."
[1:25:59] But in all that, did you notice to him
[1:26:03] that overcometh
[1:26:07] even in that worldly
[1:26:09] wicked
[1:26:11] age to him that overcometh
[1:26:15] you know what brother Brown's saying,
[1:26:16] brother Jason? saying even in that age
[1:26:19] even in that Christ rejecting
[1:26:23] lukewarm in that age where the church
[1:26:25] would be naked and miserable blind don't
[1:26:29] even know
[1:26:30] it the most wicked of all the ages he
[1:26:33] said even today to him that overcometh
[1:26:36] you know what God saying there's going
[1:26:37] to be overcomersmen
[1:26:40] how many say how many can say tonight
[1:26:42] Lord let that be me
[1:26:45] let me end in saying is they put him
[1:26:48] out. They actually put Christ out of the
[1:26:54] church. And in Revelations, we see him
[1:26:57] standing at the
[1:26:58] door
[1:27:01] knocking. Remember brother Brown talking
[1:27:03] about the artist painting a
[1:27:05] picture. They come, the critics come,
[1:27:08] they
[1:27:09] said, said you made a
[1:27:11] mistake. Said you didn't put no latch on
[1:27:13] that door. You didn't. He painted that
[1:27:16] picture. Christ standing on the outside
[1:27:17] the door. He's knocking. Said, "You made
[1:27:18] a mistake." Why? What was the mistake he
[1:27:20] made? Said you didn't put a latch on
[1:27:22] that door. He said, "No." He said,
[1:27:24] "See." He said, "It's on the inside."
[1:27:28] Amen. Cuz you have to let him in
[1:27:34] now. They put him out of the church.
[1:27:37] But is there anybody in this building
[1:27:38] tonight saying, "Yes, Lord." Lord, they
[1:27:41] might not want you, but I do. Yes. Yes,
[1:27:45] Lord.
[1:27:48] Lord, this world might reject you, but I
[1:27:50] want you. Amen. I got a promise for you,
[1:27:53] friends. Whosoever will open that door
[1:27:57] and let him come in. He said, "I'll come
[1:27:59] in and I will s with you."
[1:28:02] Friends, if you'll let him in your heart
[1:28:05] tonight, Jesus will come
[1:28:08] in. The strong man, the stronger man,
[1:28:11] the good man. Let him in your house
[1:28:13] tonight. Let him
[1:28:18] in.
[1:28:19] That's how you'll keep the
[1:28:25] victory. As we just bow our heads
[1:28:30] tonight, I want to just invite you. You
[1:28:34] do the
[1:28:35] praying, friends. I I can't I can't
[1:28:39] invite Jesus into your heart.
[1:28:41] You have to do
[1:28:43] it. You do the praying
[1:28:47] now. If you want him to come in, ask
[1:28:51] him. He's a gentleman. The Holy Spirit's
[1:28:55] a gentleman. You have to invite
[1:28:57] him. How many say that tonight? Say,
[1:29:00] "Lord, come in and listen. It's doors
[1:29:03] indoors. Don't just let him in the outer
[1:29:05] room in
[1:29:06] the just inside to stand in the forer.
[1:29:09] But how many say Lord come in the secret
[1:29:12] places. I don't want to hold nothing
[1:29:14] back tonight. Lord I want to open every
[1:29:16] door in my life. Just come in
[1:29:19] Lord just begin to ask him tonight.
[1:29:22] Heavenly
[1:29:24] Father, Lord, you see these young hearts
[1:29:29] and Lord Jesus, we just try to be
[1:29:31] obedient to your spirit
[1:29:33] and Lord, there's so many things, Lord,
[1:29:36] that we would perhaps love to say and
[1:29:38] things we've studied and thoughts, Lord,
[1:29:40] and things that were omitted and left
[1:29:43] out and but God, that's not what is
[1:29:46] what's important and that's not what I
[1:29:48] come to do tonight. And I ask you, Lord,
[1:29:50] in coming here, I said, Lord, you have
[1:29:52] your way. You speak the things that need
[1:29:55] to be spoken, oh Lord God.
[1:29:58] Lord, you know the needs. Lord, I don't
[1:30:00] know what they are. I don't But Lord,
[1:30:02] you know you're the omnisient God. Oh
[1:30:04] God, you're the omnipotent God. Lord
[1:30:07] Jesus, I I pray tonight, God, as a word
[1:30:10] has went forth that it's pricricked the
[1:30:11] hearts. Oh God, may it be Lord, even as
[1:30:15] it was, Lord, there on the day of
[1:30:17] Pentecost, Lord, when Peter begin to
[1:30:19] stand up and he be to speak the words of
[1:30:21] life. Oh God, and their hearts begin to
[1:30:24] be pricricked by that word and they
[1:30:26] begin to say, "What must we do? What
[1:30:29] must we do?" And now I can hear a
[1:30:30] prophet at the opening of the seals and
[1:30:32] he stands there and he says, "If you've
[1:30:34] not been baptized in the name of the
[1:30:36] Lord Jesus Christ, I command thee, run
[1:30:39] to the water quickly. If you've not
[1:30:41] received the spirit of God in your life,
[1:30:43] I command you, receive ye the Holy
[1:30:45] Ghost. Oh God, I feel the urgency of the
[1:30:49] hour. I feel the closing out of the
[1:30:51] time. The Gentile days are coming to an
[1:30:53] end. Oh God, I stand before this
[1:30:56] audience tonight. And Lord, I want to
[1:30:58] repeat the words of our prophet. Receive
[1:31:00] ye the Holy Ghost. Receive you the Holy
[1:31:02] Ghost. Be born again of the spirit of
[1:31:05] God. Receive Jesus Christ. It's the
[1:31:08] token or perish.
[1:31:10] Accept it tonight. Receive it tonight.
[1:31:13] Oh God, hear the cries of these hearts.
[1:31:16] Hear the cries of these these young
[1:31:18] people tonight as they lifted up their
[1:31:20] hands and their you hear their hearts
[1:31:22] crying out to you. Doors are opening up.
[1:31:26] Oh God, come and abide. Come, Holy
[1:31:29] Spirit, abide.
[1:31:32] Take up your residence now. Occupy the
[1:31:34] house. Let the good man come. Let the
[1:31:37] stronger man
[1:31:39] come. Oh, have your way, Lord. Have your
[1:31:42] way. We commit our lives in this service
[1:31:45] and all this this camp, Lord. Everything
[1:31:47] that'll be said and done, we commit into
[1:31:50] your hands in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:31:57] Little girl was lying
[1:32:00] there. People were weeping.
[1:32:05] They just laughed at
[1:32:08] Jesus when he said she's only
[1:32:13] sleeping. But as he took her by the
[1:32:17] hand, well, she began to live
[1:32:21] again. Some began to praise the Lord.
[1:32:26] Tom began to
[1:32:29] say, "He's in the
[1:32:33] house." And death has to
[1:32:37] flee. And now there is
[1:32:41] light where darkness used to
[1:32:45] be. And now there is
[1:32:49] hope. There's no more doubt.
[1:32:53] [Music]
[1:32:55] Praise his
[1:32:58] name. Praise his
[1:33:02] name. He's in the
[1:33:05] [Music]
[1:33:08] house. And we were like that little
[1:33:12] girl dead in all our
[1:33:16] sins. But Jesus touched this heart of
[1:33:20] mine and he gave me life again.
[1:33:24] [Applause]
[1:33:26] And I am just a house of a
[1:33:29] rain ever since that blessed
[1:33:33] day. Well, there's a light that shines
[1:33:36] in me for all the world to
[1:33:40] see. And he's in my house. Oh death
[1:33:46] pass.
[1:33:49] Oh, and now there is
[1:33:53] light where darkness used to
[1:33:57] be. Now there is
[1:34:01] hope. There is
[1:34:04] [Music]
[1:34:05] no
[1:34:07] praise name. I'm going to praise his
[1:34:12] name.
[1:34:15] in the
[1:34:18] house. You got to see. Oh, this is your
[1:34:22] moment. Now there
[1:34:25] is no dark
[1:34:33] right now. right now.
[1:34:37] Oh,
[1:34:39] praise. Praise his
[1:34:44] [Music]
[1:34:49] name. Mercy. Oh,
[1:34:52] my little girl was lying there. My
[1:34:58] people were think about that now. That's
[1:35:01] a true story. We just laugh at
[1:35:04] Jesus when he said now she's only seen
[1:35:08] that's just as real as your life. As he
[1:35:10] took her by the hand, watch it now. She
[1:35:14] began to live. Here it
[1:35:18] is. Praise the
[1:35:24] Lord. He's in my house.
[1:35:28] [Music]
[1:35:35] Hallelujah.
[1:35:37] Now used to
[1:35:41] be there
[1:35:45] is there's
[1:35:49] no
[1:35:53] praise. Praise his name.
[1:35:57] [Music]
[1:36:01] We were like that little girl. Lift it
[1:36:04] up now. We were like that little girl.
[1:36:09] Dead in all our sins. But Jesus touched
[1:36:14] this heart of mine. Wow. Gave me life
[1:36:18] again. Is that true?
[1:36:20] I am just the house of Yes, sir. This
[1:36:26] blessed
[1:36:27] day, there's a light that shines from. I
[1:36:32] want all this world to see. Come on.
[1:36:36] There he is in my house. Come on,
[1:36:39] spirit. You got to let me hear you. Let
[1:36:43] me hear you. There is
[1:36:46] light. Where darkness used to
[1:36:50] be,
[1:36:52] there is hope.
[1:36:56] And there's no one else. Oh yeah. Oh,
[1:37:00] praise him. Oh
[1:37:02] yeah. Praise the
[1:37:07] Lord. He
[1:37:10] is.
[1:37:12] Hallelujah. Glory to
[1:37:14] God.
[1:37:16] Glory. Hallelujah.
[1:37:19] Lord. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:37:25] You relate to that song? You relate to
[1:37:28] the sermon you heard tonight? That's
[1:37:30] real life, friends. What you heard
[1:37:32] tonight was preaching that deals with
[1:37:35] real life. The devil didn't want you to
[1:37:39] hear any of that.
[1:37:41] And you heard all of it.
[1:37:44] Now, you know, I don't know how long
[1:37:47] maybe you come here tonight and you
[1:37:49] know, I I believe that everybody that
[1:37:52] comes to these events comes to grow in
[1:37:54] Christ.
[1:37:56] Is that fair? Maybe you come here, you
[1:37:59] say, "This is my year. This is I'm not
[1:38:01] I'm not not going to need another camp
[1:38:03] after this one. I'm going to be free
[1:38:06] completely. I'm going to live where I
[1:38:08] want to live in Christ." Well, I want
[1:38:11] you to know something. You don't even
[1:38:12] got to wait till the end of this camp.
[1:38:13] Amen. You don't even got to wait till
[1:38:16] the end of this service.
[1:38:19] No, not at all. You know, when when you
[1:38:22] when you when you think about, you know,
[1:38:25] how long does it take God to do
[1:38:27] something? I mean, think about you say,
[1:38:30] "Man, I've had this thing a long time,
[1:38:31] Brother Jason." Well, the Antichrist
[1:38:35] worked for 2,000 years and set up to a
[1:38:39] point you find in Revelation 18. It was
[1:38:41] a beast in control of the world for
[1:38:43] 2,000 years in the Gentile ages. And God
[1:38:47] took it down in one
[1:38:49] hour. God only needs one hour to
[1:38:52] accomplish anything in your life. He
[1:38:55] undid 2,000 years of hard work of the
[1:38:58] devil and he undid it in one hour. The
[1:39:00] Bible says in in one day so great a thou
[1:39:02] so so great a destruction and then it
[1:39:04] went on from there it said in one hour
[1:39:06] and they cried and said alas alas such a
[1:39:09] great city oh my all of this for in one
[1:39:11] hour in one hour it was made desolate
[1:39:18] God don't need long
[1:39:20] in one hour you know I I I was standing
[1:39:24] I was sitting there thinking as brother
[1:39:25] Josh was preaching that and I thought
[1:39:27] about brother Brandham
[1:39:30] you know telling I I was reading here
[1:39:32] some time ago in a discussion with
[1:39:33] another minister and we were talking
[1:39:34] about where brother Brandham I forget
[1:39:36] the exact details of the story but he
[1:39:39] was speaking to an audience and and they
[1:39:42] had somebody had been through a hard
[1:39:43] trial and and it was a church and it
[1:39:45] struggled and and brother Brandham said
[1:39:47] and it took six years and he said but
[1:39:50] finally after six years six years they
[1:39:53] got the victory and brother Brandham
[1:39:55] said they didn't need to wait six
[1:39:56] minutes right I got They didn't need to
[1:40:00] wait six minutes. I thought about I
[1:40:02] thought about brother Brandham talking
[1:40:03] about 6 seconds smith. You ever hear
[1:40:04] brother talk about 6 seconds smith? 6
[1:40:06] seconds smmith because he put you on the
[1:40:08] floor in 6 seconds. He put a three-piece
[1:40:10] on you and now lights out you're gone.
[1:40:12] One shot sometimes. 6 seconds. I'm going
[1:40:15] to tell you something. I think the real
[1:40:16] 6 seconds might be here in the building
[1:40:18] tonight.
[1:40:20] I ain't talking about some boxer from
[1:40:22] back in the day of brother Brandham's
[1:40:24] boxing days. I'm talking about a Holy
[1:40:26] Spirit who don't need 2,000 years to set
[1:40:29] you free. He don't need 6 hours. He
[1:40:32] don't need 6 years. He don't need six
[1:40:35] minutes. He don't need six
[1:40:39] seconds. You can have that deliverance
[1:40:42] right
[1:40:43] now. You don't need to wait six more
[1:40:46] seconds. You don't need three more
[1:40:48] services. You can have it right now.
[1:40:53] [Applause]
[1:40:56] Brother Josh talking about how that
[1:40:58] quoting there when brother Brandham is
[1:40:59] quoting and
[1:41:01] saying my goodness said here comes a
[1:41:04] situation and and and and people
[1:41:08] sometimes they they become so distraught
[1:41:11] with what God can do and and he says you
[1:41:14] know God can can do a miracle and God
[1:41:17] can come and and he can you might have
[1:41:20] something some disease some affliction
[1:41:22] and God can just disappear it. I thought
[1:41:25] about that. Wow. God can disappear. And
[1:41:27] brother Josh goes on to say, "Now look,
[1:41:29] you're if you're not careful when the
[1:41:32] when the devil comes back around and he
[1:41:35] says, now that same faith that took it
[1:41:37] away, that unbelief will resurrect it."
[1:41:40] I mean, did you know you had
[1:41:41] resurrection power?
[1:41:45] Resurrection power is God power. That's
[1:41:48] God power. So, let me say to you
[1:41:49] tonight, don't use your God power to
[1:41:52] resurrect the devil. Don't use your God
[1:41:54] power to make a treaty with the devil.
[1:41:56] Use your Don't help him. Use your God
[1:41:59] power. How many say tonight, I'd like
[1:42:01] for the power of God to disappear my
[1:42:03] affliction. Disappear this weakness. How
[1:42:06] many would say, "Tonight, I want to have
[1:42:08] this weakness. I want to have this
[1:42:10] trouble. I want to have this problem. I
[1:42:12] want the Holy Spirit to disappear it in
[1:42:15] my life tonight." Oh, I'm here to tell
[1:42:18] you something, friends. You don't need
[1:42:19] to wait any time at all right now. God
[1:42:22] can disappear whatever is troubling you
[1:42:25] with the power of the
[1:42:27] resurrection. I'm a believer of that,
[1:42:29] friends. I appreciate Brother Josh
[1:42:31] declaring. He said, I'm I'm a
[1:42:34] Pentecostal. Me,
[1:42:36] too. I'm here to tell you the message of
[1:42:38] the hour will identify you. The world
[1:42:40] has a trouble with that these days. They
[1:42:42] can't identify gender. They can't
[1:42:44] identify anything. The message will
[1:42:46] identify your gender.
[1:42:48] It'll it'll tell you whether you're a
[1:42:50] boy or a girl. It'll make a girl act
[1:42:52] like a lady and a boy act like a
[1:42:54] gentleman. The message will do more than
[1:42:57] that. It'll do more than identify your
[1:42:59] gender. It'll identify your origin.
[1:43:02] It'll identify your heritage. It'll
[1:43:06] identify your lineage. It'll tell you
[1:43:08] your name was in the lamb's book of life
[1:43:12] before the foundation of the world. And
[1:43:14] there's not enough devils in all of hell
[1:43:17] to keep you out of it.
[1:43:21] Hallelujah. Oh, hallelujah,
[1:43:25] friends. My If the enemy has taken such
[1:43:28] a beating tonight, what is in store in
[1:43:30] the next three services? I He's probably
[1:43:33] running for the hills. Amen. The power
[1:43:36] of God and the preaching of the gospel.
[1:43:38] You know what it does, Brother Brandham
[1:43:39] said? It said it drives back spirits of
[1:43:41] unbelief.
[1:43:44] and allows the Holy Spirit to deal with
[1:43:47] you. So, you're at a good place. You're
[1:43:50] at a place where the word is going
[1:43:53] forward. How many appreciate that
[1:43:54] tonight? How many appreciate our brother
[1:43:56] Josh laboring like that?

[1:48:27] Are you willing to follow your king,
[1:48:29] friends?
[1:48:31] Are you willing to give him your whole
[1:48:33] heart and your whole life? Say,
[1:48:35] "Tonight, Lord, my
[1:48:37] king." Hallelujah. All the world will
[1:48:41] praise your great
[1:48:49] name. Your great
[1:48:55] [Music]
[1:48:59] name. We love you, Lord God.
[1:49:03] How we love you in this building
[1:49:05] tonight. Father, what a word. What a
[1:49:09] life comes forth from this word. What a
[1:49:12] faith, Lord, in the hearts of these
[1:49:14] young men and young women. It was
[1:49:16] obvious, Lord, from the from the minute
[1:49:19] go that they wanted to be here. They
[1:49:22] assembled, Lord, think of it, Father,
[1:49:25] when the whole world is running after a
[1:49:28] false system and Satan's got all
[1:49:32] control. It's a complete takeover. His
[1:49:34] He has his full Eden.
[1:49:38] He's got all the politics, all the
[1:49:40] pullpits, all the science, all the
[1:49:43] education. He's got the families, the
[1:49:45] homes, the social fabric of the whole
[1:49:48] nation, all the entertainment industry.
[1:49:51] Lord, it just burns him that he doesn't
[1:49:54] have this little bride. She just keeps
[1:49:57] marching for Zion. Oh, she won't be
[1:50:01] distracted. She won't be set aside. She
[1:50:03] won't be denied.
[1:50:06] Oh lamb of God, help us to march more
[1:50:08] towards Zion. Father, what a service
[1:50:11] tonight. What a word that came forth.
[1:50:14] What a courage puts in our heart. I sit
[1:50:17] there, Lord, thinking, "Oh, lamb of God.
[1:50:21] Build faith and build courage in the
[1:50:23] hearts of these young men and young
[1:50:25] women. And build it in mine, Lord. Build
[1:50:28] it in all of us. Father, we're at a
[1:50:30] great hour, tremendous hour. Oh God, we
[1:50:34] need to see you so clearly. You have
[1:50:37] manifest yourself in this day. What a
[1:50:39] privileged people we are. We thank you
[1:50:42] for it. Lord, I pray you will go with
[1:50:45] these young men and young
[1:50:47] women. Lord, give them good rest
[1:50:49] tonight. What other what other
[1:50:52] activities maybe uh are planned? I don't
[1:50:55] even know what the schedule is, Lord.
[1:50:57] But I pray from from the moment they
[1:50:59] walk out of this building, they won't
[1:51:01] walk out of your presence.
[1:51:03] That your presence, your abiding
[1:51:06] presence, you told Lord, you told a
[1:51:09] prophet when a evil spirit stood there
[1:51:12] in his room and and hissing and spitting
[1:51:15] at him said, "You're an impostor.
[1:51:18] You're a fake." They those devils still
[1:51:20] try to say that today.
[1:51:22] And brother Brandham just set up not a
[1:51:25] bit of he just looked right at him and
[1:51:26] said, "Satan, you're an offense to me."
[1:51:30] And that devil vanished. And right down
[1:51:33] in that same corner where he had stood,
[1:51:35] that pillar of fire dropped down. And
[1:51:38] you said to your prophet, "Don't ever
[1:51:40] fear to do anything, for the never
[1:51:43] failing presence of Jesus Christ goes
[1:51:45] with you
[1:51:46] always." Lord, that's a promise to this
[1:51:49] entire bride. your neverfailing
[1:51:52] presence, the realities of the living
[1:51:55] God to live in our lives. It's more than
[1:51:58] a saying, Lord. It's more than a cliche.
[1:52:00] It's more than a doctrine, as the
[1:52:02] preacher was preaching tonight. It's a
[1:52:05] person. This message is a person. And
[1:52:09] this person, this this mystery, as the
[1:52:13] Apostle Paul shows us, the fellowship of
[1:52:15] the mystery. And people are saying, "Oh,
[1:52:17] it's a mystery. It's a mystery." No, no,
[1:52:18] no. This mystery wants to have
[1:52:20] fellowship with you. This mystery wants
[1:52:24] to have fellowship with you. It's a
[1:52:26] person. It's a presence of almighty God.
[1:52:29] We thank you. We commit everything now
[1:52:32] into your hands. May the balance of our
[1:52:34] evening be spent glorifying you. Lord,
[1:52:37] when we lay our head at last on our
[1:52:39] pillow
[1:52:41] tonight and we're just alone there with
[1:52:44] you and our thoughts, may we raise a
[1:52:47] hand and one last salute before slumber
[1:52:51] takes us and just say,
[1:52:53] "Lord, thank
[1:52:55] you. Thank
[1:52:57] you. Thank
[1:52:59] you." We thank you for all these things,
[1:53:02] Lord, in Jesus wonderful name. We're
[1:53:06] happy to have had you here tonight. You
[1:53:07] have any other announcements? Come,
[1:53:09] Brother Jay. Amen. We got a few
[1:53:11] announcements for you. I didn't get a
[1:53:13] chance to speak to you before we
[1:53:15] started, but I'm so happy to see you
[1:53:17] all. God bless you. A lot of the faces,
[1:53:19] almost all of you from last year. Amen.
[1:53:22] You must have booked early. So, we're
[1:53:24] happy to have you here again this year.
[1:53:26] Amen. God bless you. God bless you,
[1:53:30] everyone. Go ahead and have your seats.
[1:53:32] We're going to make some announcements.
[1:53:34] What would youth camp be without
[1:53:36] announcements,
[1:53:38] right? And so we want to we'll do that
[1:53:41] and then we'll uh continue worship uh
[1:53:44] after I'm
[1:53:46] done. Welcome. We love you all. Very
[1:53:50] excited you're here. Um I just want to
[1:53:54] repeat my appreciation to the counselors
[1:53:58] that have come to help us. Without them,
[1:54:01] uh none of this would be possible. So,
[1:54:04] thank you all much.
[1:54:11] Yes.
[1:54:13] Amen. Just a few reminders. I hope
[1:54:16] you'll love me after I'm done with the
[1:54:17] reminders
[1:54:19] still.
[1:54:21] Um, service seating is for counselors
[1:54:24] and campers only. So, um, make sure that
[1:54:28] that's reserved for that. And I see we
[1:54:31] have counselors that are having to stand
[1:54:33] up. So, um, uh, just make sure that if
[1:54:36] you're a camp, not a camper or a
[1:54:38] counselor, you check before you get a
[1:54:40] seat with brother Brad in the back.
[1:54:42] Brother Brad's back there. Raise his
[1:54:44] hand if you don't know who he is. Um, he
[1:54:47] also requested that we not uh have seats
[1:54:51] saved for service. Makes their job very
[1:54:54] difficult. So, if you're here, sit down
[1:54:57] and and take your spot and uh don't save
[1:54:59] it for a bunch of different people.
[1:55:03] Um, regarding lunch and the meals down
[1:55:07] there, I know we had some problems with
[1:55:09] some people has had some confusion. If
[1:55:12] you do have some food allergies, please
[1:55:14] let the servers know right away that you
[1:55:16] do what what allergies you have. They've
[1:55:19] made accommodations for all of that.
[1:55:23] Um, also the main office last, if you
[1:55:27] were here last year, you know the main
[1:55:28] office was in the main lodge there just
[1:55:31] as you came in. Our main office where
[1:55:34] our medical uh team is going to be and
[1:55:37] our admin staff is the concessions
[1:55:39] building. So, if you have any needs of
[1:55:41] anything, go to that spot, the
[1:55:44] concessions building. They're right in
[1:55:46] the middle. um administration. Lost and
[1:55:49] found will be in that as well. Um
[1:55:52] there's going to be t-shirts and hoodies
[1:55:54] for sale there if you didn't order one
[1:55:57] before camp. They're in the concessions
[1:56:00] building. Um practice time for choirs
[1:56:04] and specials will be tech texted out to
[1:56:08] all of you individually when your time
[1:56:10] will be.
[1:56:13] Um, everybody see the schedule and the
[1:56:18] rules and regulations posted up in your
[1:56:21] cabins. They're there. Um, I'm going to
[1:56:25] read through a couple of them just to to
[1:56:27] to be sure. I know some of you some of
[1:56:30] the young people will uh just go right
[1:56:33] past those because you got more
[1:56:34] important things to do. So, want to make
[1:56:37] sure everybody is aware just of the
[1:56:40] basic ones. So some obvious ones, boys
[1:56:43] are not allowed in girls dorms and vice
[1:56:44] versa. And there's no zero tolerance
[1:56:46] tolerance for that. As we say in that,
[1:56:50] we're trying to operate our camp with
[1:56:51] clear expectations and clear
[1:56:55] consequences. So if if you hear me say
[1:56:58] zero tolerance for that, that means that
[1:57:01] we have to immediately
[1:57:03] uh send you send you home. So we don't
[1:57:07] want to do that. the very very very last
[1:57:09] thing we want to have to do. But let's
[1:57:12] let's remember that consequences are
[1:57:14] clear. So if we say there's zero
[1:57:16] tolerance, don't do it. Uh leaving your
[1:57:19] cabin before rise and shine and after
[1:57:21] lights out is not allowed. And again,
[1:57:24] zero tolerance for it. Also, if you if
[1:57:27] you think you can get out and you you
[1:57:29] escape, you're not going to be escaping
[1:57:33] anywhere because there's cameras all
[1:57:35] over the property and
[1:57:38] we're going to be aware that you're out
[1:57:39] and someone's going to find you and then
[1:57:42] you're going to have to call your
[1:57:43] parents and have them come get you.
[1:57:45] So, no one is allowed on the lake
[1:57:48] trails, the back lake trails, the one
[1:57:50] along the front is fine, but the back um
[1:57:54] non-paved lake trails after
[1:57:56] dark. Campers are not allowed to drive
[1:57:59] any golf carts or jump on them when
[1:58:01] they're in motion. If you remember last
[1:58:04] year,
[1:58:08] uh once campers are checked in, not
[1:58:12] allowed to leave to leave the camp at
[1:58:14] all. You have to stay here. So if you've
[1:58:16] driven your vehicle, it's in place.
[1:58:20] Don't move it. Don't go anywhere. You're
[1:58:22] here. You're
[1:58:24] stuck. If you do have if you do have a
[1:58:26] need, something that you've forgotten,
[1:58:28] please let your counselor know. We'll do
[1:58:30] our best to try to make accommodations
[1:58:31] for you.
[1:58:33] So, I'm going to leave it off there. It
[1:58:35] gets way more boring from
[1:58:38] that. Please read them. If you break a
[1:58:40] rule and you say, "I didn't know." I'm
[1:58:43] sorry. You don't have an excuse. It's
[1:58:44] posted everywhere. You got a text with
[1:58:47] it. Make sure you sign up for that text.
[1:58:50] You'll see the different places up front
[1:58:51] where it is. when we need to send you
[1:58:54] updates, timing updates, or even if
[1:58:56] there's an emergency on the camp and we
[1:58:57] need to alert you, if you have your cell
[1:58:59] phone with you on camp, make sure to to
[1:59:03] text that number and click join now.
[1:59:06] So, let's see.
[1:59:10] Sunday
[1:59:12] afternoon, we'll have baptisms uh in the
[1:59:15] lake for anyone that would like to. Just
[1:59:18] be sure to verify with your local pastor
[1:59:23] before you do that.
[1:59:27] Um, concessions are going to be open
[1:59:30] every day at 9:00 a.m. and they will
[1:59:34] close at 10:30 p.m. Um, hot food is
[1:59:38] going to be available for purchase at
[1:59:40] concessions after the service tonight.
[1:59:43] There's going to be bonfire devotions.
[1:59:46] If you were here last year, you know how
[1:59:48] epic they were with with Brother Diggs.
[1:59:50] and we're excited to have him back with
[1:59:52] us and minister to you tonight. So that
[1:59:55] will the bonfire part of the or the
[1:59:58] devotions part of it will start at 1000
[2:00:01] p.m. sharp. So after we dismiss, make
[2:00:04] sure you get down there, get in, get
[2:00:06] through concessions and get your get
[2:00:08] your place there around the Lakeside uh
[2:00:12] bonfire. And so I think that is
[2:00:17] everything. Brad, did I forget
[2:00:18] something? We're good. All right, let's
[2:00:22] let's
[2:00:24] stand and worship the Lord

[2:06:29] done. His arms.
[2:06:33] Oh, in his
[2:06:35] arms I
[2:06:38] feel
[2:06:39] protected. Oh yes, in his
[2:06:44] arms never
[2:06:49] disconnected. In his
[2:06:52] arms I
[2:06:54] feel protected.
[2:06:57] There's no place I'd rather rather
[2:07:02] be. I'm falling in love.
[2:07:06] Oh, falling in love with
[2:07:13] Jesus. Oh, falling in love with Jesus.
[2:07:20] [Music]
[2:07:22] Oh, falling in
[2:07:25] love with
[2:07:28] Jesus is the best thing I've ever ever
[2:07:35] done. Amen. Bring it up one and can sing
[2:07:38] this one. It is so
[2:07:42] sweet to trust in
[2:07:47] Jesus just to
[2:07:50] take him at his word. Oh, and just to
[2:07:59] rest upon his for all. Oh yes.
