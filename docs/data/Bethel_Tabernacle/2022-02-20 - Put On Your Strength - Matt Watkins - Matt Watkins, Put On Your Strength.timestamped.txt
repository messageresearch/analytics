[46:01] burned burning upon my heart and i'm
[46:03] just even
[46:05] leading up to the service here today
[46:08] that satan has battled me in my body the
[46:10] last two days just felt just felt

[46:23] lord has for us you believe that god is
[46:26] here that he's mindful of any request no

[46:32] might have prayed this morning what you
[46:33] might have prayed last night what's upon
[46:35] your heart amen god is just mindful of
[46:38] us i believe that this morning so i'd
[46:40] just like to take a thought here and i'd
[46:42] like to title this put on your strength
[46:46] put on your strength
[46:49] isaiah chapter 52 verse 1 awake
[46:54] and then he repeats it awake
[46:57] put on thy strength
[47:00] o zion
[47:02] put on thy beautiful garments
[47:04] o jerusalem
[47:06] the holy city
[47:08] for henceforth there shall no more come
[47:11] into thee the uncircumcised and the
[47:13] unclean
[47:15] shake thyself from the dust
[47:18] arise
[47:19] and sit down
[47:21] o jerusalem
[47:23] loose thyself from the bands of thy neck
[47:26] o captive daughter of zion
[47:29] for thus saith the lord you have sold
[47:31] yourself or not
[47:33] and you shall be redeemed without money
[47:36] for thus saith the lord god my people
[47:38] went down a four time into egypt the
[47:40] sojourn there and the assyrian oppressed
[47:43] them without calls
[47:45] now therefore
[47:46] what have i hear sayeth the lord that my
[47:48] people is taken away for naught
[47:51] that they rule they that rule over them
[47:54] make them to howl saith the lord and my
[47:57] name continually every day
[48:00] is blasphemed
[48:02] therefore my people shall know my name
[48:05] therefore they shall know in that day
[48:08] that i am he that doth speak behold
[48:12] it is i
[48:14] lord we thank you for the reading of
[48:15] your word
[48:17] knowing lord that
[48:18] it's applicable it's
[48:21] father even no matter what
[48:24] situation your family finds themselves
[48:26] in today your word meets the challenge
[48:29] of the hour
[48:31] every situation lord every
[48:33] today is a group gathered here that came
[48:35] and
[48:36] lord they've prepared themselves the
[48:39] music the singing the worship that has
[48:41] went forth lord and collectively we
[48:43] stand here lord as your children lord
[48:46] lifting up our hands representing needs
[48:48] god that we have upon our heart
[48:50] lord we believe that you're mindful this
[48:52] morning that you can do the lord above
[48:56] anything we could hope or think or ask
[48:58] this morning lord you're for us you're
[49:00] with us
[49:01] god you you're here to encourage us here
[49:04] to speak to us now lord may we just step
[49:06] aside right now and surrender our
[49:08] vessels lord to you each and every
[49:10] single person from the front row all the
[49:13] way to the back of the sound booth lord
[49:15] i pray that every heart would just be
[49:17] surrendered right now as we raise our
[49:18] hands and say lord we surrender to you
[49:21] right now to your spirit may father you
[49:24] come and speak lord your word that you
[49:26] would want to say move me the speaker
[49:28] move them the hearer out of the way and
[49:30] may you get the glory and everything be
[49:32] with our pastor this morning who's away
[49:34] lord even an hour or two behind us god
[49:37] may be going into the pulpit soon lord i
[49:39] pray that you would anoint him father
[49:41] the people the group that's there may
[49:43] you accomplish the purpose that you sent
[49:45] him for be with us now lord we ask in
[49:48] jesus christ's name
[49:50] amen you can be seated this morning
[49:52] thank you amen
[49:59] i want you just to keep your bible open
[50:01] there to isaiah we're going to back up
[50:03] just for a moment and i'm just going to
[50:05] uh read just a few scriptures here that
[50:08] uh sort of preface or give this some
[50:11] context
[50:12] it's amazing because
[50:14] the lord says even in isaiah chapter 49
[50:17] and we're gonna
[50:19] i'm just gonna quote from that and you
[50:20] don't have to turn i don't have the
[50:22] verse references here but
[50:24] in isaiah chapter 49
[50:27] god gives this god gives his children
[50:29] this message and you leads all the way
[50:32] up to isaiah 52 which we just read and
[50:34] we're going to go back to it
[50:36] but god's
[50:37] people are even in isaiah 52 when he's
[50:41] describing this daughter of zion and
[50:43] he's saying that you're you're groveling
[50:45] in the dirt you're you're on the ground
[50:48] and and he says and the the
[50:49] uncircumcised are coming in unto thee
[50:52] and blaspheming and it's amazing because
[50:54] if you go and study in the book of
[50:56] isaiah in chapter 49 specifically
[51:00] god begins to speak to them and he
[51:02] begins to tell them and i'm just going
[51:04] to quote this you don't have to turn
[51:06] there he says you shall no longer hunger
[51:09] and thirst
[51:10] and he says i will have mercy on you and
[51:13] lead you by the springs of living water
[51:16] for the lord will comfort his people
[51:19] and have mercy on all the troubled ones
[51:22] and this is specifically speaking to
[51:24] their condition
[51:26] that they're they're they're they're
[51:27] they're crying for deliverance and
[51:29] they're being oppressed by an oppressor
[51:32] and god has uh
[51:34] they begin to to cry out and god has
[51:37] responded and saying
[51:38] you'll no longer hunger and thirst
[51:40] you're no longer going to remain in
[51:42] darkness but he says i'll have mercy on
[51:45] you i'll lead you by the springs of
[51:47] living water and he says and and and the
[51:49] lord will comfort his people
[51:52] and have mercy on all of the troubled
[51:55] ones
[51:56] it's amazing because the voice of the
[51:58] lord just continues to speak to them in
[52:00] this darkness
[52:02] this isn't israel in a time of great uh
[52:05] uh happiness and rejoicing a revival
[52:09] but it's a time when they're oppressed
[52:11] it's a time when they're downcast and
[52:13] they're they've reached the bottom and
[52:16] they're at their wit's in and they're
[52:17] they're they're they're they're they're
[52:19] in there they're so low that they're
[52:20] literally uh in the dirt and laying and
[52:23] groveling on the ground and they're
[52:26] clutching this chain and and god speaks
[52:28] to them in isaiah and he says uh you're
[52:30] he says
[52:31] he's the the bible begins to describe
[52:34] them and says that they're chained about
[52:35] by the neck
[52:37] and and they're they're they've hit rock
[52:39] bottom they're at their very lowest and
[52:41] god begins to
[52:43] begin to speak to them and he says i'll
[52:45] deliver you and i'm going to have mercy
[52:47] upon the troubled ones and you'll no
[52:49] longer thirst again and you'll no longer
[52:51] hunger and every tear that you're you're
[52:54] crying and all of the anguish and all of
[52:56] the sorrow and everything that you're
[52:57] going through god says i've bottled all
[53:00] of your tears i've put them in a bottle
[53:03] david references that so beautiful and
[53:05] says every tear you've cried you've put
[53:07] them in your bottle in your book of
[53:09] remembrance you know the lord notices
[53:12] what we do humanly
[53:14] the lord notices what we do on a very
[53:17] natural level sometimes we make serving
[53:19] the lord such an ethereal and such a
[53:22] spiritual experience and no doubt
[53:24] there's it is a spiritual experience it
[53:27] is a spiritual relationship but let me
[53:29] just tell you sometimes serving god
[53:32] doesn't always feel anointed it doesn't
[53:34] always feel revelated it doesn't always
[53:37] feel like you're you're you're you're
[53:38] trembling it doesn't always feel like
[53:40] you're about to speak in tongues
[53:43] sometimes serving the lord feels very
[53:45] natural just when you wake up every day
[53:48] and you put your feet on the ground and
[53:50] you're facing troubles and you're facing
[53:52] difficulties and you're facing trials
[53:54] but you have faith to come to church and
[53:56] you have faith to keep on believing it
[53:58] and you just no matter what you're going
[54:00] through you're still confessing but i
[54:02] know my god's a healer and i know my
[54:04] god's a deliverer and it may not make
[54:06] sense right now but i know he's got it
[54:08] all in control how many times friends
[54:10] have you said that from your mouth and
[54:12] says but i know the lord has it all in
[54:14] control do you realize it may not feel
[54:17] anointed it may not feel like you're on
[54:19] fire it may not feel like you're about
[54:20] to shout but you just utter the words
[54:22] he's got it all in control do you
[54:25] realize that that may not feel like
[54:26] anything but you are accomplishing the
[54:29] purpose of god and defying the kingdom
[54:32] of the enemy
[54:36] and so he comes he comes to this place
[54:38] and he begins to say you're you're down
[54:40] cast i'm going to deliver you my my
[54:43] people will not
[54:44] he says they'll they'll i'll have mercy
[54:46] on the troubled ones it's incredible
[54:48] because even through all of this voice
[54:50] of encouragement
[54:51] and through all of the words of the lord
[54:53] that he's speaking to them their
[54:55] reaction isn't to suddenly stand up and
[54:58] say praise the lord i've heard the voice
[55:00] of god is going to deliver me and i know
[55:01] it doesn't look like it but i'm going to
[55:03] rejoice no
[55:05] the isaiah 49 and verse 14
[55:08] it says but zion says if you have this
[55:11] you could put it up isaiah 49 and 14
[55:13] brother josh
[55:15] he says now this is the lord after he
[55:16] speaks himself i'll deliver them i'll
[55:18] have mercy upon you leave me lead you by
[55:20] the springs of living water i'll comfort
[55:22] my people and have mercy on all the
[55:23] troubled ones and he says in verse 14
[55:27] but zion said this is their reply the
[55:30] lord hath forsaken me
[55:33] and my lord
[55:34] hath forgotten me
[55:37] even after the voice of the lord do you
[55:40] do you know what that would feel like
[55:42] now i'm just going to stop here and say
[55:43] something because i'm preaching to you
[55:45] put on your strength
[55:47] do you realize what it does to the lord
[55:49] when he's to when with the the the
[55:52] reaction that it draws from a heavenly
[55:54] father when he's promised his children
[55:58] something and their reply isn't to trust
[56:01] his word that reply isn't to grab ahold
[56:04] by faith but to say the lord's forsaken
[56:06] me he's forgotten me
[56:10] how much it hurts and i'm going to speak
[56:11] to speak on this and a man would
[56:13] understand this because a man to to a
[56:15] man thank you brother your word means
[56:18] something
[56:20] right
[56:21] when you give your word to to your wife
[56:24] and you tell and you tell them something
[56:25] you don't believe a real man he has a
[56:28] sense of
[56:29] good pride and we preach against private
[56:31] there's there's a there's a pride or let
[56:33] me say a dignity that a man should have
[56:36] he should his word should mean something
[56:39] to him
[56:40] you know it bothers him to a man it
[56:42] bothers him when he gives his word and
[56:45] he doesn't he senses that there's a
[56:46] distrust
[56:48] you don't trust me well i i said it
[56:50] didn't i made a promise didn't i
[56:52] and it's something discouraging to him
[56:54] even to a young man as as a teenage boy
[56:58] to have the trust of his father should
[57:01] mean something to him that when he tells
[57:03] you when you when you tell him something
[57:05] he doesn't question he doesn't research
[57:07] it he doesn't investigate it he just
[57:08] takes you at your word and there's
[57:10] there's a sacred trust that he has that
[57:12] when he speaks he means it he'll stand
[57:15] behind it and you can depend upon it
[57:19] a man even in a marriage in a home when
[57:21] a wife takes the word and when the when
[57:23] when a husband speaks and then maybe a
[57:25] trouble or some kind of issue has came
[57:27] up and the man just the man says don't
[57:29] worry honey it's going to be okay i'm
[57:31] going to take care of it you know it
[57:33] does something it gives that man some
[57:36] sense of fulfillment when the pressure
[57:38] really comes off and the the fear leaves
[57:41] his family because he's given his word
[57:45] it does something to him when he can
[57:47] look at a troubled situation and they
[57:49] believe him
[57:51] and he maybe doesn't have it all figured
[57:52] out and he doesn't even have know how
[57:55] it's going to work out but he has
[57:57] he has his family has the assurance that
[58:00] the man the father the high priest the
[58:02] head of the home the father the husband
[58:05] the father you can rest the easy because
[58:08] i'm gonna i'm gonna take care of this
[58:10] don't worry i'm gonna take care of us
[58:12] how much more to our heavenly father
[58:15] when he promises us his word how much it
[58:18] must delight him when we believe his
[58:20] word
[58:24] and how it must hurt him when we doubt
[58:27] his word
[58:29] are you with me here this morning
[58:32] and he says but but zion said the lord
[58:34] has forsaken me and my lord hath
[58:36] forgotten me
[58:37] now notice these aren't these aren't
[58:39] sons of the devil these aren't heathens
[58:42] that we're dealing with here this is
[58:44] this is this this is zion this is the
[58:46] family of god the whole the holy family
[58:48] of god separated unto god who is chosen
[58:51] this isn't the sinner this isn't the the
[58:53] the hittite or the perizzite or the
[58:56] canaanite this is god's family
[58:59] his own children of whom the virginity
[59:02] or the seed line or the life would come
[59:04] through
[59:05] and they're they're saying the lord has
[59:07] forsaken me he's forgotten me
[59:11] who saw the lord notice this the bible
[59:13] says they're the sons of abraham those
[59:15] who knew righteousness
[59:17] in whose heart was the law of god
[59:20] if anybody
[59:22] should have believed the word it should
[59:25] have been them
[59:27] if anybody should have taken god his
[59:29] word and accepted it
[59:31] it should have been him that's why the
[59:33] lord began to get so impatient
[59:36] and he says i even i this is isaiah
[59:38] chapter 51 and you can turn there
[59:40] brother josh isaiah 51 and verse 12
[59:42] we're going to get to 52. let's look at
[59:44] verse 12 of isaiah 51 notice what the
[59:47] lord is saying here you can almost see
[59:50] this impatience of the lord as god says
[59:53] i'm going to deliver you i'm going to
[59:54] i'm going to deliver you you're going to
[59:55] walk by springs of water and then their
[59:57] response is oh the lord's forsaken us
[59:59] he's forgotten us so god continues he
[1:00:01] says i
[1:00:02] even i
[1:00:04] am he that comforteth you
[1:00:07] who art thou that thou should just be
[1:00:09] afraid of a man that shall die and of
[1:00:11] the son of man which shalt be made as
[1:00:13] grass keep going verse 13
[1:00:16] and he says and forgivest the lord thy
[1:00:19] maker that has stretched forth the
[1:00:21] heavens and laid the foundations of the
[1:00:23] earth and has feared continually every
[1:00:26] day because of the fury of the oppressor
[1:00:29] as if he were ready to destroy and where
[1:00:32] is the fury
[1:00:34] of the oppressor
[1:00:36] now it's incredible because god has
[1:00:38] given them this word he's reminding them
[1:00:40] he's he's crying out to them and then
[1:00:42] you come all the way over
[1:00:44] to isaiah chapter 52. if you'll turn
[1:00:47] there where we read we're just going to
[1:00:48] read this again
[1:00:50] he says awake awake verse 1
[1:00:53] put on thy strength o zion
[1:00:56] put all thy beautiful garments
[1:01:00] o jerusalem the holy city
[1:01:03] for hence forth there shall no more come
[1:01:05] unto thee the uncircumcised in the
[1:01:07] unclean
[1:01:09] awake
[1:01:11] awake so they're in this they're in this
[1:01:13] stupor they're down on the ground
[1:01:15] they're they're they're asleep or else
[1:01:17] he wouldn't be staying awake
[1:01:19] they've forgotten who they were
[1:01:22] they forgotten who their heavenly father
[1:01:24] was
[1:01:25] they forgotten his promises how can you
[1:01:27] forgive me the lord is trying to remind
[1:01:29] them it's i even i
[1:01:31] he goes on further we read it we read it
[1:01:33] here in verse um the verse six therefore
[1:01:35] my people shall know my name therefore
[1:01:38] they shall know in that day that i am he
[1:01:41] that doth speak
[1:01:43] behold
[1:01:45] verse 6 brother josh behold it is i
[1:01:50] therefore my people should know my name
[1:01:52] they shall know that in that day that i
[1:01:53] am he that doth speak behold
[1:01:56] it is i you see how much the lord wants
[1:01:59] to make himself known in the middle of
[1:02:02] your darkness
[1:02:04] do you see how much the lord wants and
[1:02:06] has a desire they shall know that i am
[1:02:09] he that speaks behold in his eye
[1:02:13] back up to verse one he says wake awake
[1:02:15] put all my strength shake thyself verse
[1:02:17] two
[1:02:18] from the dust arise
[1:02:21] and sit down o jerusalem
[1:02:24] loose thyself
[1:02:25] from the bands of thy neck
[1:02:29] o captive daughter of zion
[1:02:33] a condition that she was in
[1:02:35] in the dust and even to god remember
[1:02:38] this is this is zion's this is this is
[1:02:40] the daughter of god this isn't the
[1:02:42] daughter of jezebel
[1:02:44] this is his own family
[1:02:46] this is his own daughter
[1:02:48] if anybody he was going to project his
[1:02:50] love to it would be his own daughter
[1:02:54] and here is a father she sees it and he
[1:02:56] sees her in this condition and she's in
[1:02:58] the dust and she was she was once
[1:03:01] imagine what she was she was once a pure
[1:03:04] uh uh a beautiful woman
[1:03:07] and she she has royal garments because
[1:03:09] of who she is but now she's in the dirt
[1:03:12] her her garment is tattered it's it's
[1:03:14] it's full of it's it's dust she's in the
[1:03:17] dust she's laying there
[1:03:18] and she's being abused
[1:03:21] she's being trampled on
[1:03:23] by the uncircumcised and the unclean her
[1:03:26] garment is now torn and it's filthy and
[1:03:29] it's dirty and it's tattered and it's
[1:03:31] whole has holes in and she's laying
[1:03:33] there and gone and she's howling in
[1:03:35] despair and crying out
[1:03:37] and she's got a chain on her neck
[1:03:39] imagine this condition that even his
[1:03:42] even her heavenly father's looking at
[1:03:43] this and he begins to speak and he says
[1:03:46] wake up
[1:03:47] wake up child
[1:03:49] get up out of the dirt do you know who
[1:03:52] you are do you know who do you remember
[1:03:54] who where you came from
[1:03:56] and he says she's laying there and he
[1:03:58] says shake myself from the dust she's
[1:04:01] clutching at this chain
[1:04:03] about her neck it's incredible because
[1:04:05] i'm reminded of the words of the apostle
[1:04:08] paul and he says be you speaking to the
[1:04:11] family of god he says be not entangled
[1:04:14] again
[1:04:15] with the yoke of bondage
[1:04:17] wherewith christ hath already set you
[1:04:20] and made you free
[1:04:23] so you can take god and god can deliver
[1:04:25] you and free you and let you can free
[1:04:27] you of chains and then you yourself go
[1:04:29] and chain yourself right back up
[1:04:32] and he says she's clutching at her neck
[1:04:35] and god is saying now the enemy's there
[1:04:37] he's blaspheming taunting her
[1:04:41] and and then god god comes and it is
[1:04:43] it's it's amazing because
[1:04:46] he doesn't pick her up he doesn't he
[1:04:48] doesn't stand there and shield her from
[1:04:50] the enemy and and come in like a great
[1:04:52] superman and pick her up and dust her
[1:04:55] off and and shake her off and then take
[1:04:57] her and to put a garment god doesn't do
[1:04:59] any of that he just speaks to her
[1:05:01] amen
[1:05:02] awake
[1:05:04] awake
[1:05:06] put on your strength
[1:05:08] now that's easy to do
[1:05:11] it's easy to do when you're
[1:05:13] vibrant and full of life and
[1:05:16] prayers are being answered and you're
[1:05:17] walking and constant vision of the lord
[1:05:20] and the lord's just pouring out blessing
[1:05:22] and and my there's no trouble and it's
[1:05:24] easy to do you stand there and i'm a
[1:05:27] child of god i'm a son of god i'm a
[1:05:29] daughter of god it's easy to do it's
[1:05:31] much harder
[1:05:33] when life is so troubled you and so
[1:05:35] afflicted you and the devil so fought
[1:05:38] you and so
[1:05:39] attacked you and now you're down it's
[1:05:41] much easier when you're already standing
[1:05:44] to put on your beautiful garment it's
[1:05:45] much harder when you're down on the
[1:05:47] ground
[1:05:48] and you're having trouble
[1:05:51] and satan has walked all over her
[1:05:53] and now she can hear maybe just as a
[1:05:56] faint cry
[1:05:57] she's even there groveling doesn't know
[1:05:59] who she is her senses her sensibility is
[1:06:02] gone
[1:06:04] and and and and and she's this is this
[1:06:07] is the daughter of god bearing the one
[1:06:10] who bore the vessel of god and now now
[1:06:13] now she's laying there it's so much
[1:06:15] easier when you're on top of the world
[1:06:17] so much harder when life comes and hits
[1:06:19] you out of nowhere and you find yourself
[1:06:22] turned turned around and you're you're
[1:06:23] trying to get your senses about you and
[1:06:26] you know and when it rains it pours and
[1:06:28] when the devil knows he's got you
[1:06:30] starting to get you down here brother
[1:06:31] branham says that's when he really
[1:06:33] throws on the punches
[1:06:36] and he when he sees he got you tripped
[1:06:38] up and starting to fall man he'll really
[1:06:40] unleash all hell upon you and upon you
[1:06:43] and attack you from every direction and
[1:06:45] attack your mind and your family and
[1:06:46] your children your finances your health
[1:06:49] they'll get you and it'll get you to
[1:06:50] such a place to where you're just almost
[1:06:52] like brother banh talks about amnesia
[1:06:54] you forget who you are you forget who
[1:06:56] where you came from
[1:06:59] and he says and she's down on the ground
[1:07:01] and god's beginning to whisper to her
[1:07:03] and beginning to speak to her
[1:07:05] it's incredible because you come to this
[1:07:08] story and i'm just going to take a
[1:07:09] complete turn here
[1:07:11] there's no there's it's amazing because
[1:07:14] there's no one
[1:07:15] to me
[1:07:17] there's there's
[1:07:18] a few characters in the bible that are
[1:07:21] more
[1:07:22] uh
[1:07:23] up and down and in and out and
[1:07:26] one day in and one day out then the man
[1:07:29] jacob
[1:07:30] started looking
[1:07:31] even just two days ago and the lord just
[1:07:33] brought me i knew this was the direction
[1:07:35] of the lord lord have me go just looking
[1:07:37] over this man's life
[1:07:39] and jacob's is a is a
[1:07:42] uh a cheater
[1:07:44] you you he's he's he's a conniver he's a
[1:07:46] supplanter it's what his name means
[1:07:49] he deceives and he connives he's
[1:07:51] manipulating
[1:07:53] and he's and and yet what's so
[1:07:55] incredible is that this this man who you
[1:07:58] read about that's so horrible and so
[1:08:01] evil
[1:08:02] yet god loves this man amen
[1:08:06] and he says that even before he was born
[1:08:09] before he ever came or breathed life
[1:08:11] before he'd done good or evil paul makes
[1:08:13] it clear that god says i loved him
[1:08:15] there's a there's a there's a love that
[1:08:17] he had for this man
[1:08:19] he wasn't a good man
[1:08:21] but he was god's man
[1:08:23] and you can be not a good man but you
[1:08:25] could be god's man
[1:08:27] and there are certain people who are
[1:08:28] good men who aren't god's men
[1:08:31] and by worldly standards they might seem
[1:08:34] good
[1:08:35] but to god is really all that matters
[1:08:37] because we look on the outward
[1:08:38] appearance that's natural it's normal
[1:08:40] for our in our fallen flesh even as a
[1:08:43] believer we look on the outward we look
[1:08:46] in the in the chart of wins and losses
[1:08:48] that's how we view people
[1:08:50] we look at the outward appearance and
[1:08:52] god says for you he says but i'm my ways
[1:08:54] just let me remind you this morning god
[1:08:56] doesn't see things how we see things
[1:09:00] let me remind you family of god you may
[1:09:03] be looking at a certain situation a
[1:09:05] certain way and god might be looking at
[1:09:08] it entirely different
[1:09:11] completely different
[1:09:14] but god's purpose comes upon this man's
[1:09:16] life
[1:09:18] and when god's purpose when god sets out
[1:09:20] his purpose upon a life
[1:09:23] nothing can stop that purpose
[1:09:26] let me go further and say that god's
[1:09:29] purpose
[1:09:30] never dies
[1:09:32] and it never changes
[1:09:34] no matter what god sets his purpose to
[1:09:37] no matter what happens or how the object
[1:09:40] of that purpose responds
[1:09:42] god's purpose never changes
[1:09:46] you take a man like samson who
[1:09:49] who would look at a life of of of the of
[1:09:51] just disaster at the very end a man who
[1:09:54] has so much potential and did so much
[1:09:56] for god and god comes to him and even at
[1:09:59] his birth you remember when he appears
[1:10:00] to manoah in judges uh 12 or 13 and god
[1:10:04] appears to manoah and he appears to this
[1:10:06] man and this
[1:10:08] this father and mother and he says for
[1:10:10] lo thou shall conceive a son and and no
[1:10:12] razor shall come upon his head there
[1:10:14] will be a nazareth unto god and god
[1:10:16] begins to tell them that even before
[1:10:19] samson is born even before he's ever
[1:10:22] done anything good or he's ever done
[1:10:24] anything bad before any of that happens
[1:10:27] god has a purpose for a life whether
[1:10:30] that life ever comes to the purpose that
[1:10:33] god calls it to doesn't change whether
[1:10:36] god's purpose is upon that life
[1:10:40] now i'm just going to stop and slow down
[1:10:42] because i just felt the anointing of the
[1:10:43] holy spirit said it's right here
[1:10:46] this is what the struggle was even over
[1:10:48] thank you lord
[1:10:50] god's purpose
[1:10:51] upon samson's life
[1:10:54] didn't change when samson didn't go
[1:10:57] god's way
[1:11:00] it did not matter god didn't see samson
[1:11:04] and see a man who was going to surrender
[1:11:06] and a heart that was submissive to the
[1:11:07] lord and he says aha ah i got it that
[1:11:09] man look at him look at look at his
[1:11:11] obedience right there that's the perfect
[1:11:12] candidate right there and now i'm gonna
[1:11:14] come no before samson ever was born
[1:11:18] before he ever came onto the earth
[1:11:20] before he ever proved himself
[1:11:23] god decided a purpose would be fulfilled
[1:11:27] in his life
[1:11:28] and it did not change
[1:11:33] god comes to minoa and says he'll be a
[1:11:35] nazareth unto god and he says he'll be
[1:11:36] he'll be and he says for he'll begin to
[1:11:38] deliver for the the my my the israel out
[1:11:41] of the hand of the oppressors the philip
[1:11:43] the philistines
[1:11:45] and god says and i don't want to take
[1:11:47] time to turn there but if you look in
[1:11:48] the book of judges and he says for lo he
[1:11:51] shall be a nazarite unto god even from
[1:11:54] his birth
[1:11:57] unto his death
[1:11:59] that's right
[1:12:01] it'll be a nazareth unto god from his
[1:12:03] birth
[1:12:05] all the way to his death from the
[1:12:07] beginning when you turn the first page
[1:12:09] in the very first story before you even
[1:12:11] turn and open the book there's a purpose
[1:12:13] that god has
[1:12:16] so it didn't matter what happened in the
[1:12:18] middle
[1:12:19] didn't what matter what what chapter 2
[1:12:21] or chapter 3 or chapter 4 said god set
[1:12:25] out a purpose upon a life
[1:12:29] and it wouldn't change even when samson
[1:12:32] resisted and went the total opposite
[1:12:35] direction
[1:12:36] of that purpose
[1:12:39] because god made a promise and god is a
[1:12:42] promised keeper
[1:12:44] he doesn't break his word
[1:12:46] he's a covenant keeper
[1:12:48] and when he promises something he sees
[1:12:50] it through to the end
[1:12:53] and god says he'll be a nazarite unto he
[1:12:55] says there'll be a nazi than me from his
[1:12:57] birth even unto his death
[1:13:00] that means that even death doesn't
[1:13:02] change the purpose that god has
[1:13:06] and so god breathes upon this man we
[1:13:08] know his life goes to completely
[1:13:09] opposite direction he marries the wrong
[1:13:11] woman he goes into the wrong town he
[1:13:13] messes up here and he messes up there
[1:13:15] and he's a complete failure you say well
[1:13:17] then i'm sure at some point god says man
[1:13:20] you know what i must have made a
[1:13:21] horrible mistake when i when i came to
[1:13:24] manila i'm really i picked the wrong guy
[1:13:26] no god's promise never changed
[1:13:29] god was with samson in timnath he was
[1:13:32] with samson at
[1:13:34] at no matter uh at gaza he was with
[1:13:37] samson with the philistines he was with
[1:13:39] samson you say he was there god made a
[1:13:41] promise and he wouldn't leave
[1:13:45] though his life with the opposite
[1:13:47] direction god's purpose never
[1:13:51] changes
[1:13:54] even to jacob we find jacob's stories
[1:13:57] he's running from esau he steals the
[1:13:59] birth white church birthright tricks him
[1:14:03] tricksy man and esau because of the kind
[1:14:05] of man he is gives up the birthright for
[1:14:07] a pot of stew
[1:14:09] and so jacob jacob uh comes and he's now
[1:14:12] he's on the run and the mother sees the
[1:14:15] trouble that uh that's going to happen
[1:14:17] and and rebecca hears of this and and
[1:14:20] esau says i'm going to murder him i'm
[1:14:22] going to kill my brother and so rebecca
[1:14:23] says oh jacob we've got to do so or
[1:14:26] isaac we got to do something with jacob
[1:14:28] so let's send him away and so jacob goes
[1:14:30] on his journey
[1:14:32] and and and he sets off and goes to
[1:14:35] pataram and and
[1:14:37] and his entire life takes a turn and a
[1:14:39] course now remember
[1:14:41] remember the purpose of god was already
[1:14:44] upon his life before he tricked esau
[1:14:49] the purpose of god was already about his
[1:14:51] life before he was ever
[1:14:54] born so jacob sets off and
[1:14:58] genesis chapter 28 brother josh if you
[1:15:00] want to pull that up that'd be good
[1:15:02] genesis 28
[1:15:04] he goes to where laban lives
[1:15:06] he's going to find a wife there and
[1:15:08] going gonna try to live peacefully
[1:15:11] while esau is calming down
[1:15:15] and so he goes and god gives him this
[1:15:18] amazing genesis chapter 28 verse 12
[1:15:20] brother josh look at this as he appears
[1:15:22] to jacob and he dreamed
[1:15:25] and he dreamed and behold a ladder
[1:15:28] set up on the earth
[1:15:30] and the top of it reached the heaven now
[1:15:32] god appears to jacob in a dream
[1:15:36] and jacob sees this ladder and it goes
[1:15:38] from heaven from earth all the way up to
[1:15:41] heaven
[1:15:42] and behold the angels of god ascending
[1:15:47] and descending
[1:15:48] on it
[1:15:50] now
[1:15:52] this incredible dream that god gives
[1:15:55] jacob isn't just you know isn't just
[1:15:57] some kind of uh
[1:15:59] oh effect or god's just gonna shake him
[1:16:01] or give him this incredible vision just
[1:16:03] to give him a vision just to give him a
[1:16:05] dream just it isn't for a show god does
[1:16:08] nothing for a show
[1:16:10] god does nothing just to impress
[1:16:11] somebody he's not going to impress you
[1:16:13] he's not going to impress me when god
[1:16:15] does something it's for a specific
[1:16:16] reason and a specific purpose and has a
[1:16:18] specific message behind it
[1:16:22] and so jacob dreams this dream and it's
[1:16:25] not a like we said it's not some kind of
[1:16:28] special effect or way to get him
[1:16:30] emotional and get him stirred up but god
[1:16:33] is literally drawing back the curtains
[1:16:36] of earth
[1:16:37] he's drawing back the curtains of
[1:16:40] jacob's current surroundings and his
[1:16:42] curtain current conditions
[1:16:45] and god says jacob i want to show you
[1:16:47] something that just beyond this human
[1:16:50] realm
[1:16:51] just beyond this human veil
[1:16:54] is a curtain i'm going to draw back as
[1:16:55] brother branham says just beyond this
[1:16:58] curtain he says just be on this curtain
[1:17:00] of time in this dimension and god takes
[1:17:02] them beyond the curtain of time what's
[1:17:03] he doing he's opening the curtain to let
[1:17:06] brother branham realize there's more to
[1:17:08] your life than just what you see
[1:17:13] there's more to your life than just what
[1:17:15] you're going through
[1:17:17] you look at the here and now and the
[1:17:19] current struggle and the current problem
[1:17:20] and the current issue and the current
[1:17:22] stress but god says let me just draw
[1:17:24] back the curtain of time to show you
[1:17:27] there's a much bigger picture
[1:17:32] than what you're seeing brother brandon
[1:17:33] says he says would you would you ever he
[1:17:36] says i he says oh oh would you like just
[1:17:39] to see beyond the curtain of time and
[1:17:41] brother adam says it this way he says oh
[1:17:43] it would help me so much
[1:17:47] i'm glad he let brother branham see
[1:17:49] because it wasn't just going to help him
[1:17:50] it's going to help me in 2022
[1:17:54] to see beyond the curtain of time and
[1:17:55] realize there's more to this life than
[1:17:57] just what meets the eye
[1:18:01] god was literally drawing the curtain
[1:18:03] back and showing jacob
[1:18:06] what's he seeing a ladder
[1:18:08] an angel's going up down and up and down
[1:18:11] and up and down
[1:18:13] what's he trying to show jacob jacob
[1:18:16] even if you don't see it there's
[1:18:18] activity happening all the time
[1:18:21] even if you don't sense it or you don't
[1:18:23] feel a child and you feel like things
[1:18:25] are just mundane and things are to stale
[1:18:28] there's something taking place all the
[1:18:30] time there's angels going up and coming
[1:18:33] down they're coming to visit you and
[1:18:35] encourage you and pray for you and and
[1:18:37] try to anoint your faith there's
[1:18:39] something happening jacob
[1:18:41] there's activity in the heavenlies
[1:18:45] amen
[1:18:46] at all times jacob they never stop
[1:18:51] they never stop
[1:18:53] they go up and they go down and they
[1:18:55] never quit and they never angels never
[1:18:58] get tired
[1:19:01] hello somebody
[1:19:03] angels let me tell you you might get
[1:19:05] fatigued and you might get tired but god
[1:19:07] never gets tired he never gets tired he
[1:19:09] never gets fatigued he's not sweating
[1:19:13] you might labor and you might toil and
[1:19:14] you might sweat
[1:19:16] but there's divine oh i just want to
[1:19:18] tell you this morning there's divine
[1:19:21] activity that is happening on behalf of
[1:19:24] your family even when you can't see it
[1:19:27] and you can't feel it and you can't hear
[1:19:29] it and there's no evidence of it oh it's
[1:19:32] like the song says even when it feels
[1:19:34] like i'm surrounded i'm surrounded by
[1:19:38] you amen
[1:19:40] and what what's the what's the what's
[1:19:41] the the verse say even when it feels
[1:19:43] like you're not working you're working
[1:19:46] even when it doesn't feel like you're
[1:19:48] moving you're moving even when it feels
[1:19:50] like there's no activity to my life take
[1:19:53] courage
[1:19:54] god's moving
[1:19:58] that's what god was showing jacob these
[1:20:00] angels have an assignment they're going
[1:20:01] back and forth to earth
[1:20:03] to lead and to guide and to minister the
[1:20:06] bible says the angels of god camp about
[1:20:09] those who fear him
[1:20:11] they can't they literally camp and take
[1:20:14] their abode amongst god's family
[1:20:21] those angels that are there
[1:20:22] to warn you
[1:20:24] to protect you
[1:20:26] to guide you
[1:20:27] to minister to you
[1:20:29] to encourage you to guard you
[1:20:34] god says jacob i want you to understand
[1:20:36] because it's going to become important
[1:20:38] in your life specifically
[1:20:40] there's a ladder there
[1:20:42] and all those angels that are going up
[1:20:44] and down god says i'm going to make a
[1:20:46] promise to you jacob and i'm going to
[1:20:49] keep working out my promise and my plan
[1:20:52] no matter if you sit down and you get
[1:20:55] tired and you feel discouraged god says
[1:20:58] i'm going to keep working i'm going to
[1:21:00] keep moving
[1:21:01] i'm going to keep proceeding i'm going
[1:21:03] to keep pursuing i'm going to keep going
[1:21:07] and he says in verse 13 turn there if
[1:21:09] you could in genesis chapter 28
[1:21:12] he says in verse 13 and behold the lord
[1:21:15] stood above it now this is god above
[1:21:18] everything that he's seen jacob sees
[1:21:19] this ladder he sees this vision and
[1:21:22] behold the lord stood above it and said
[1:21:25] i am the lord god of abraham thy father
[1:21:28] and the god of isaac now why is god
[1:21:30] saying this this is important because
[1:21:32] now god is joining this man jacob and
[1:21:35] he's attaching him to a promise he
[1:21:38] already made to a father and a
[1:21:39] grandfather
[1:21:41] you see why the birthright was so
[1:21:43] important to jacob
[1:21:45] because that right that birthright that
[1:21:48] meant that the lineage of christ the
[1:21:50] messiah would come through his seed
[1:21:55] and so jacob
[1:21:56] fights to get that birthright are you
[1:21:58] here church
[1:21:59] he fights to get that birthright so god
[1:22:01] now because he has the birthright god
[1:22:04] stands above it and says i'm the lord
[1:22:06] god of abraham thy father and of god
[1:22:09] and he says and the god of isaac the
[1:22:11] land whereon thou liest to thee will i
[1:22:14] give it and to thy
[1:22:17] seed
[1:22:18] so what's god doing
[1:22:20] because jacob has the birth he's not a
[1:22:22] good man don't don't forget this this is
[1:22:25] not a good man he's not a god man yet in
[1:22:28] fact he never will be
[1:22:30] until his name is changed
[1:22:36] hello hope you're catching that this
[1:22:38] morning
[1:22:40] he'll never be a god man
[1:22:43] until his name is changed
[1:22:45] but does that mean the purpose of god is
[1:22:48] not with him even when he's not a good
[1:22:50] god man
[1:22:53] even when he's not before he's israel
[1:22:55] when he's still jacob when he's still a
[1:22:57] deceiver god is still making a promise
[1:22:59] to him
[1:23:00] remember what brother branham says he
[1:23:01] says at the at pentecost he says they
[1:23:04] didn't become sons at pentecost when the
[1:23:07] spirit of god he says that he they
[1:23:09] didn't become sons then they were always
[1:23:12] sons
[1:23:14] and he says you didn't become a son of
[1:23:15] god because you were born again you were
[1:23:18] always a son of god
[1:23:20] even in your sinful most darkest moments
[1:23:23] you were always a son therefore you were
[1:23:26] reborn
[1:23:29] so jacob even though he's not a good man
[1:23:31] yet the promises of god is with him and
[1:23:34] god says and to thee will i give it and
[1:23:36] to thy seed so now god brings jacob into
[1:23:39] this covenant blessing with abraham and
[1:23:41] isaac the lord was saying i've accepted
[1:23:45] you into my promise into my plan
[1:23:49] you're the firstborn now jacob
[1:23:52] and now through you you have the
[1:23:54] birthright so now all of the blessings
[1:23:58] that i promised to abraham and all of
[1:24:01] the promises and all of the blessings
[1:24:03] that i promised to isaac are now passed
[1:24:06] down to you
[1:24:09] and you did nothing to deserve that
[1:24:14] do you realize the promises you have
[1:24:16] today
[1:24:17] because of mercy that rewrote your life
[1:24:21] and you're a spiritual seed of abraham
[1:24:23] and you did nothing to deserve it but
[1:24:25] the same promises that he made to
[1:24:27] abraham are now passed down to you and
[1:24:29] your family and to your seed and to your
[1:24:32] children and your children's children
[1:24:34] there's a promise and a blessing that is
[1:24:36] upon the life of a believer and they did
[1:24:39] nothing to deserve it
[1:24:42] we ought to be thankful this morning
[1:24:45] now god says in verse 15 notice this
[1:24:48] here
[1:24:49] verse 15 he says and behold
[1:24:52] i am with thee
[1:24:55] and will keep thee in all places
[1:24:58] whether thou goest
[1:25:01] and will bring thee again into this land
[1:25:04] for i will not
[1:25:06] leave
[1:25:07] thee
[1:25:09] until
[1:25:10] i have done
[1:25:11] that
[1:25:12] which i have spoken
[1:25:15] what a powerful
[1:25:17] promise
[1:25:20] that god makes
[1:25:21] to a very bad man
[1:25:26] what a powerful
[1:25:27] covenant
[1:25:29] god attaches
[1:25:30] to this deceiving
[1:25:33] shyster
[1:25:36] lying conniving manipulating
[1:25:40] here's the same man that comes before
[1:25:42] laban
[1:25:43] and this man is so good that he decides
[1:25:46] he's not sure if laban's gonna kill him
[1:25:48] or not so he sends his wife and kids
[1:25:50] first to see well if they die then i
[1:25:52] know i'll retreat and go the other way
[1:25:54] that's what kind of man we're dealing
[1:25:55] with
[1:25:57] not much of a man
[1:25:59] but yet even in that state god's purpose
[1:26:03] is is with him
[1:26:05] god says i'll behold i am with thee
[1:26:09] and we'll keep thee and all
[1:26:11] i love this this is my sermon here for
[1:26:14] today
[1:26:15] i'll keep thee in all the places
[1:26:19] whether thou go
[1:26:21] god was giving him an oath
[1:26:23] and he says i'll never leave you jacob
[1:26:26] i want you to remember this promise i'll
[1:26:28] be with you every step you take
[1:26:33] every step every turn
[1:26:36] you'll never make a move in your life
[1:26:38] that i'm not right there beside you
[1:26:41] does that mean jacob is going to go
[1:26:42] everywhere that god tells him to go no
[1:26:44] he's going to go the opposite but does
[1:26:46] that change the plan of god does god
[1:26:49] ever leave him no when god says go left
[1:26:52] jacob goes right
[1:26:54] but god didn't go left god went right
[1:26:56] with jacob
[1:26:58] because god's purpose follows his seed
[1:27:01] he follows his child no matter where
[1:27:03] that child goes
[1:27:05] god says i'll never leave you i'll never
[1:27:06] forsake you
[1:27:08] i'm going to go with you every when i
[1:27:10] say go straight and you do a u-turn and
[1:27:12] you go the other way
[1:27:15] god says well i guess i'll make a u-turn
[1:27:17] and go with you
[1:27:19] and then god says now go right and you
[1:27:21] go left
[1:27:23] god says i'll be with you in all the
[1:27:25] places
[1:27:26] i'll never leave you
[1:27:28] i'll never forsake you
[1:27:30] until i've done that which i have spoken
[1:27:33] to thee of
[1:27:35] my
[1:27:36] purpose
[1:27:37] will never
[1:27:38] change listen
[1:27:41] even if you never surrender to my will
[1:27:45] i'll never leave you
[1:27:50] even if you spend your life
[1:27:53] calloused and cold and carnal
[1:27:56] unsurrendered
[1:27:58] my promise is still right beside you
[1:28:04] no matter
[1:28:06] what
[1:28:09] jacob
[1:28:11] no matter where you go
[1:28:13] i'll never leave you
[1:28:15] i'll never forsake you oh i know i've
[1:28:18] preached on this here before but i'm
[1:28:19] just going to cover it just one more
[1:28:20] time do you realize what god says to
[1:28:23] jacob
[1:28:24] when he says in isaiah we've read it in
[1:28:26] isaiah and even if you back up god says
[1:28:28] to god says this exact thing to jacob
[1:28:31] i'll never leave you
[1:28:33] i'll be with you
[1:28:36] i'll go with you in all the places
[1:28:39] whether no matter where you go jacob
[1:28:43] i'm going to stay right with you oh
[1:28:45] captive daughter he says the same thing
[1:28:47] to israel get up awake put on your
[1:28:49] strength
[1:28:51] notice he doesn't rebuke her he doesn't
[1:28:53] chastise her he doesn't speak to her
[1:28:55] meanly or an uh or a voice to attack her
[1:29:00] he's just like a kind heavenly father he
[1:29:02] whispers to her wake up awake put on
[1:29:05] your strength o zion put on your
[1:29:07] beautiful garments he says in isaiah
[1:29:08] chapter 49 can a woman forget her
[1:29:11] suckling child that she should not have
[1:29:14] compassion on the son of her womb yea
[1:29:16] they may forget
[1:29:18] yet i will not forget thee
[1:29:21] behold i have graven thee upon the palms
[1:29:24] of my hands
[1:29:25] and he says thy walls are continually
[1:29:29] before me
[1:29:31] this is isaiah 49
[1:29:33] thy walls the word for wall is choma
[1:29:36] which means like a brick mason would lay
[1:29:38] a brick and then he'd lay another brick
[1:29:40] upon another brick and he'd lay another
[1:29:42] brick upon another brick and another
[1:29:44] brick upon another brick
[1:29:45] what's he saying he's saying the brick
[1:29:47] is joined it becomes one with the wall
[1:29:51] god is saying behold i've graven thee
[1:29:53] upon the palms of my hands thy walls
[1:29:56] i've attached myself to you
[1:30:00] this is what god does to jacob i'm
[1:30:02] attaching myself to you jacob
[1:30:05] i'm this isn't this isn't a covenant to
[1:30:07] where if you do this and i do that if
[1:30:08] you do this i'll keep that god says i'm
[1:30:10] going to attach myself i'm going to
[1:30:13] build like a mason would build a wall a
[1:30:15] brick upon a brick upon a brick
[1:30:19] and no matter where you go there am i
[1:30:22] no matter where you ever go jacob i'll
[1:30:25] be with you
[1:30:28] can a woman forget her suckling child
[1:30:30] yeah they may forget
[1:30:31] but i cannot forget you because i've
[1:30:33] graven you upon the palms of my hands
[1:30:36] your walls are continually
[1:30:39] before before me
[1:30:45] we followed this here before and i'm
[1:30:46] just going to follow it here just for a
[1:30:48] moment
[1:30:50] in genesis chapter 28 i want you to look
[1:30:52] here in verse 16 as jacob begins to
[1:30:54] speak
[1:30:56] and he says and jacob awoke out of his
[1:30:58] sleep
[1:30:58] and he said surely
[1:31:00] the lord is in this place this is i this
[1:31:03] is genesis 28 brother micah verse 16.
[1:31:06] and he says here and jacob i woke out of
[1:31:08] his sleep and said surely the lord is in
[1:31:10] this place and i knew it not
[1:31:13] and he was afraid
[1:31:15] and said how dreadful
[1:31:17] now it's amazing when you click on that
[1:31:19] word it doesn't mean awful but actually
[1:31:21] the opposite it means awesome
[1:31:25] and he says how awesome is this place
[1:31:29] this is none other but the house of god
[1:31:33] and this is the gate of heaven
[1:31:37] jacob wakes up
[1:31:39] and he says here jacob rose up early in
[1:31:41] the morning
[1:31:42] and he took the stone
[1:31:44] that he had put for his pillows and set
[1:31:46] it up for a pillar
[1:31:48] and poured oil what's he trying to do he
[1:31:50] this man he's trying to do anything he
[1:31:52] can all he knows is he woke up and there
[1:31:54] was this incredible dream and he looks
[1:31:56] and he looks at the stone that his head
[1:31:59] was on and he literally takes he's just
[1:32:01] trying to do anything he can
[1:32:03] to remember to memorialize this spot
[1:32:06] so he takes the rock and he builds an
[1:32:08] altar and he says okay this is the rock
[1:32:10] my head was laying upon and he's gonna
[1:32:12] take that rock and he's gonna place it
[1:32:13] upon another then he's gonna he's gonna
[1:32:15] step back and go god met me right there
[1:32:18] and i've seen the dream and it's gonna
[1:32:19] take oil and he's gonna begin to pour
[1:32:21] oil upon that stone
[1:32:24] he's anointing that stone and you say oh
[1:32:26] jacob you're just being emotional you're
[1:32:29] all worked up and all you know in the
[1:32:31] frenzy old because god you're gonna take
[1:32:33] a stone you know that's what i said it
[1:32:35] might have looked very natural to other
[1:32:37] people
[1:32:38] but do you know god noticed what jacob
[1:32:41] did
[1:32:44] and god was watching
[1:32:46] as jacob takes this stone and he's
[1:32:48] pouring oil upon the stone
[1:32:51] jacobs rose up early in his pillar and
[1:32:53] poured over along the top of it verse 19
[1:32:55] going brother micah
[1:32:57] and he says and he called the name of
[1:32:58] that place bethel
[1:33:00] but the name of the city was called lose
[1:33:02] at the first so he gives it a name
[1:33:04] this house of god this is none other
[1:33:07] this is none other
[1:33:09] but the house of god and he makes a
[1:33:11] promise to god
[1:33:13] and he says god i'll now he says if
[1:33:15] you'll be with me and will keep me uh
[1:33:17] and give me bread to eat of ramen to eat
[1:33:19] he says raymond to put on verse 21
[1:33:22] and he says so that i come again to my
[1:33:24] father's house in peace then shall the
[1:33:25] lord be my god
[1:33:28] and you know what happens time long
[1:33:31] space of time goes on
[1:33:34] twenty years
[1:33:35] elapsed
[1:33:37] from that experience
[1:33:40] 20
[1:33:41] long
[1:33:42] years
[1:33:45] of a heart
[1:33:47] that is not in tune with god that is not
[1:33:50] in sync with his purpose
[1:33:53] that is still selfish
[1:33:56] that is still bitter
[1:33:58] that is still cheating
[1:34:00] still stealing
[1:34:02] still lying
[1:34:03] still conniving
[1:34:05] and god says go left jacob goes right
[1:34:08] god says turn around jacob continues on
[1:34:12] even after this great experience that
[1:34:14] god has
[1:34:15] and after all of the wonder and all of
[1:34:17] the glory of this moment and he's a
[1:34:19] pouring oil and he's anointing this
[1:34:21] pillar
[1:34:22] and yet 20 years go on
[1:34:26] and there's nothing jacob's just going
[1:34:27] the opposite direction you see you can
[1:34:30] have an experience with god and have a
[1:34:33] great powerful thing that god does for
[1:34:35] your life but if you don't come under
[1:34:38] simple obedience to the word of god
[1:34:42] simple obedience to the word of god in
[1:34:44] your life becomes disobedient and you
[1:34:46] spend 20 long years
[1:34:49] and he spends 20 long dreadful years
[1:34:53] stuck
[1:34:57] you know you can spend years stuck
[1:35:01] you get stuck in a ditch somewhere and
[1:35:03] your wheels are spinning
[1:35:05] and you're not going anywhere and the
[1:35:07] the more you you pit that gas pedal the
[1:35:10] deeper those wheels sink
[1:35:12] and the deeper the truck goes and the
[1:35:14] deeper the problem is
[1:35:16] and you can spend years
[1:35:19] and years
[1:35:20] and years
[1:35:23] in a rut
[1:35:24] in a ditch
[1:35:26] jacob spends years
[1:35:28] stuck
[1:35:34] when
[1:35:35] jacob
[1:35:36] when
[1:35:37] are you going to believe
[1:35:40] when jacob are you going to not just say
[1:35:43] amen to these things
[1:35:46] but when are you going to actually
[1:35:48] believe them amen
[1:35:50] and you spend years in church and years
[1:35:53] in church and years in church going from
[1:35:56] this place to that place into this
[1:35:58] ministry and that ministry and this
[1:36:01] place and that place and the problem all
[1:36:03] along lies within you jacob
[1:36:07] and he spends 20 years stuck
[1:36:10] in a rut
[1:36:12] unable to get out
[1:36:15] and he still comes to the same problem
[1:36:17] the same issue
[1:36:19] god surely surely lord you would have
[1:36:21] given up on this man after year five
[1:36:24] five years
[1:36:25] lord surely no
[1:36:29] lord what are you doing in his life i'm
[1:36:30] still standing here
[1:36:32] just waiting
[1:36:35] eight nine years 10 years 11 years let's
[1:36:38] get a status update on brother jacob
[1:36:41] where's he at
[1:36:43] lord says
[1:36:44] he's still right there still stuck in
[1:36:46] the same ditch
[1:36:48] still has the same problem
[1:36:53] lord
[1:36:54] when are you going to move on
[1:36:56] never
[1:36:58] you see when i made a promise to this
[1:37:00] man
[1:37:01] it was from birth
[1:37:02] all the way to death
[1:37:05] and even if he goes to his grave like
[1:37:07] this i'll never leave
[1:37:10] i'll never forsake him
[1:37:14] just like he says to that daughter of
[1:37:16] zion awake
[1:37:18] wake up lord
[1:37:21] pull jacob out of it
[1:37:23] no i can't
[1:37:25] lord send him get him out just pick him
[1:37:27] up just jerk him up brother branham says
[1:37:29] if god takes you through a pipe and he
[1:37:31] says and he just hears you and he says
[1:37:33] but almost like a pipe he just pulls you
[1:37:35] out through the other side and says then
[1:37:36] how would you ever say you ever overcame
[1:37:38] anything
[1:37:41] god just deliver him lord pick him up
[1:37:43] out of it god you see him in this
[1:37:45] condition he's your child he's been
[1:37:46] given your promise
[1:37:48] lord surely you'll do something special
[1:37:50] for him god says i've already done
[1:37:53] everything jacob needs i've already put
[1:37:56] inside of him
[1:37:57] [Music]
[1:38:00] it's already there
[1:38:03] daughter of zion it's already inside of
[1:38:06] you
[1:38:08] lord you see her she's laying there
[1:38:10] she's being trampled upon surely as a
[1:38:12] heavenly father you're gonna send out a
[1:38:14] rescue you're just going to come and and
[1:38:16] no
[1:38:16] no god says what i'm going to do i'm
[1:38:18] going to keep speaking awake child
[1:38:21] wake up
[1:38:22] put on your strength
[1:38:24] and he says put on your
[1:38:27] beautiful garments
[1:38:30] lord can't you put them on her no
[1:38:33] i've given them i've given her the
[1:38:35] garment
[1:38:36] but she's got to be the one to put it on
[1:38:41] i've given her everything she has need
[1:38:43] of in her journey of life all the way to
[1:38:46] a body changes already down inside of
[1:38:49] her
[1:38:50] and it's so amazing how many years
[1:38:52] people get stuck
[1:38:54] waiting for god to come and send out a
[1:38:56] rescue and some supernatural thing and
[1:38:58] this daughter of zion could have laid
[1:39:00] there for years and you know what would
[1:39:02] have happened if she discontinued to lay
[1:39:03] there she would have died there
[1:39:08] she would have died there
[1:39:10] what happens to samson he continues and
[1:39:12] he continues and continues until finally
[1:39:14] his life comes to an end now god did
[1:39:16] something glorious at the end of his
[1:39:17] life
[1:39:18] but all what god could have done had
[1:39:20] that child ever just surrendered and
[1:39:23] became obedient to the purpose of god
[1:39:26] that was following him
[1:39:32] wake up put on your strength
[1:39:34] oh beautiful daughter of zion
[1:39:37] put on your strength i'll never leave
[1:39:40] you i'll never forsake you i'm never
[1:39:42] going to quit on you i'm never going to
[1:39:43] give up on you
[1:39:44] i'm never going to stop but in order for
[1:39:46] me to do anything you've got to believe
[1:39:48] it child you've got to make a choice to
[1:39:50] believe it but you've heard this preach
[1:39:52] for year after year where you had jacob
[1:39:55] i'm still stuck in the same place why
[1:39:57] jacob you've been preached deliverance
[1:39:59] you've been preached freedom you've been
[1:40:01] preached the power of the blood you've
[1:40:03] been preached the power of atonement
[1:40:05] you've been preached the power of
[1:40:07] reconciliation
[1:40:08] you've been preached the power of
[1:40:09] redemption how much more do you need
[1:40:12] jacob everything that you need is
[1:40:14] already inside of you
[1:40:16] amen
[1:40:18] but you've got to choose
[1:40:20] to believe the word of god
[1:40:24] you got to choose to believe it
[1:40:27] no one they're waiting and waiting and
[1:40:30] waiting and waiting and waiting
[1:40:32] just like the man at bethesda the poor
[1:40:34] man the pull of bethesda and jesus comes
[1:40:36] to this man an invalid for 30 i think 38
[1:40:39] years he lays at this pool
[1:40:41] and you know jesus comes to him
[1:40:44] and it's incredible when you go read the
[1:40:45] account and jesus comes to this man
[1:40:48] jesus doesn't sit down beside this man
[1:40:50] now here's this invalid 38 years his
[1:40:53] back no doubt is hurting he can he his
[1:40:56] sores all over his body from laying
[1:40:58] there
[1:41:00] and jesus doesn't come and say
[1:41:02] oh man bud oh my poor brother does your
[1:41:06] back hurt
[1:41:09] is it painful no you know why because
[1:41:13] sin
[1:41:14] when he's healed jesus says go and sin
[1:41:15] no more so sin had put him here
[1:41:19] and jesus just comes to this man he just
[1:41:21] goes right to the
[1:41:23] cuts right to the chase
[1:41:25] and says
[1:41:26] sir
[1:41:27] will you be made whole amen
[1:41:32] and then the man starts oh well you see
[1:41:34] at 38 years every time the angel comes
[1:41:36] and stirs the water i have no man and he
[1:41:38] doesn't pick me up and and i just lay
[1:41:41] here sort of like that groveling woman a
[1:41:43] daughter of zion she's just laying there
[1:41:44] groveling getting trampled on in the
[1:41:46] dust and god's saying wake up and then
[1:41:48] god says loose yourself from the bands
[1:41:51] that are upon your neck
[1:41:53] this man says i've been laying here for
[1:41:54] years and and have no man to pick me up
[1:41:58] and to put me in the water and then
[1:41:59] jesus you know jesus you never find a
[1:42:01] dialogue
[1:42:03] you never find a conversation jesus lets
[1:42:05] him finish and then he repeats will you
[1:42:07] be made whole
[1:42:12] and so the man repeats well every time
[1:42:14] 38 years i've been laying here and
[1:42:16] there's no man to pick me up and no man
[1:42:17] to put me in the water you see
[1:42:20] people and i've said this and preached
[1:42:21] this many years ago the drunkard when he
[1:42:24] drinks alcohol and he watches how it
[1:42:26] destroys his life and it destroys his
[1:42:28] marriage and it takes his driver's
[1:42:29] license and and it takes his family and
[1:42:31] it kills his career and it kills his job
[1:42:34] he hates that
[1:42:35] people hate the result of addiction they
[1:42:39] hate the result of sin
[1:42:42] but jesus doesn't come to say do you
[1:42:44] hate the problems that sin has caused
[1:42:47] you no he says do you hate the sin
[1:42:53] do you hate the disease
[1:42:56] not the symptoms that it's caused you
[1:42:59] will you be made
[1:43:01] whole
[1:43:07] will you be delivered daughter of zion
[1:43:09] jacob for years
[1:43:11] god just keeps on
[1:43:13] and keeps on
[1:43:15] and keeps on can i have just a few more
[1:43:17] minutes
[1:43:18] are you here this morning
[1:43:21] for 20 long years trial and sorrow but
[1:43:25] you know what god's attached
[1:43:28] after leaving bethel jacob settles down
[1:43:32] and he quickly
[1:43:34] quickly
[1:43:35] i mean it's amazing how fast we forget
[1:43:40] what the lord does for us in our life
[1:43:42] amen
[1:43:44] just like that it's like poof it's gone
[1:43:47] and jacob's right back to his own his
[1:43:49] old disobedient backslid and lustful
[1:43:52] and god appears to jacob in genesis 31
[1:43:55] brother josh genesis 31 and verse 13.
[1:43:58] after he's cold and backslidden god
[1:44:00] appears to him again
[1:44:02] and he says in verse 13 i am the god of
[1:44:05] bethel
[1:44:07] where thou anoint us the pillar notice
[1:44:09] aha
[1:44:10] god noticed
[1:44:12] you think you're getting emotional when
[1:44:14] you do something and god's brother diggs
[1:44:16] is here preaching stand up and shout and
[1:44:18] say a man might do it you think oh he's
[1:44:20] just getting emotional god notices what
[1:44:22] you do
[1:44:23] god notices the voice that you say amen
[1:44:25] with god hears it and it's not important
[1:44:28] for a preacher to hear you say amen it's
[1:44:30] important for god to hear you say amen i
[1:44:33] believe what's being preached i agree
[1:44:35] with what's being preached lord be it
[1:44:37] unto me according to thy word
[1:44:40] god notice what jacob did to that pillar
[1:44:43] and the oil
[1:44:45] and he says in the god i'm the god of
[1:44:47] where thou knowing is the pillar thou
[1:44:48] vow to vow unto me now arise
[1:44:52] what's he saying to that woman that
[1:44:54] daughter wake up
[1:44:56] arise
[1:44:57] he says jacob arise
[1:44:59] lord why didn't you force him why didn't
[1:45:01] you just pull him to it no god just
[1:45:03] keeps telling him the word
[1:45:05] arise
[1:45:08] get thee out from this land and return
[1:45:10] into the land of thy kindred
[1:45:13] go left jacob
[1:45:15] he's like jacob come on you can do it
[1:45:17] jacob you're gonna do it and you read
[1:45:19] the next verse
[1:45:20] jacob
[1:45:21] you're going right god said go left
[1:45:24] why'd you go right
[1:45:26] what's it gonna take jacob for you to
[1:45:28] believe the word of god here god's
[1:45:30] coming to you appearing to you again go
[1:45:33] back to jay go back to bethel instead he
[1:45:36] goes to shechem
[1:45:39] hold on a minute i just read god said go
[1:45:42] to bethel you would you went to to check
[1:45:45] them
[1:45:47] what's what's going on in your mind
[1:45:49] jacob
[1:45:50] he's stuck in that rut he's stuck in
[1:45:53] that ditch
[1:45:55] he's stuck there and his wheels just
[1:45:56] keep spinning and his problems get
[1:45:58] bigger
[1:45:59] and his ditch gets deeper
[1:46:03] and it just exacerbates the problem
[1:46:07] he goes to shechem
[1:46:08] it's amazing
[1:46:10] because in hebrew if you click on the
[1:46:12] word shekham and strong's concordance it
[1:46:14] means two things
[1:46:16] going back
[1:46:19] not to bethel
[1:46:22] but backsliding
[1:46:24] and it means this
[1:46:26] a place of burdens
[1:46:31] a place
[1:46:32] of burdens do you know
[1:46:36] do you know what it is do you know what
[1:46:38] it means do you know what it brings
[1:46:41] when you disobey what god tells you you
[1:46:44] know where you come to a place of
[1:46:45] burdens
[1:46:49] and shechem's going to be a place of
[1:46:51] great burden to this man it's going to
[1:46:53] go beyond and scar jacob now the effect
[1:46:56] of the father is not just going to
[1:46:58] affect the father the man jacob but now
[1:47:00] that disobedience is going to pass down
[1:47:03] and it's going to mark his family
[1:47:07] because disobedience to the word
[1:47:09] obedience to the word blesses not just
[1:47:12] the man but the entire family
[1:47:15] and disobedience to the word doesn't
[1:47:17] just hurt one but it hurts the whole
[1:47:19] body
[1:47:21] and shechem is going to mean it mean a
[1:47:22] place of burdens
[1:47:30] all kinds of trouble is going to come
[1:47:31] from that choice
[1:47:33] jacob
[1:47:35] his daughter
[1:47:36] his daughter dina
[1:47:38] is going to be defiled
[1:47:41] that's just a mess man i don't even want
[1:47:43] to get into it this morning just to save
[1:47:44] time
[1:47:45] but just a mess
[1:47:48] a
[1:47:48] mess he goes instead of to bethel he he
[1:47:52] goes to shechem and then what happens to
[1:47:54] his daughter now his sons and his sons
[1:47:56] become murderers and then murder the
[1:47:58] sons of of this man the the all of his
[1:48:01] brothers
[1:48:03] and jacob barely gets out
[1:48:06] barely gets out there alive
[1:48:08] and his one daughter's affected for the
[1:48:10] rest of her life she's defiled
[1:48:12] and burdens are now brought upon him
[1:48:18] jacob
[1:48:21] my now at this point
[1:48:23] if i was his daddy
[1:48:25] if you were his
[1:48:27] if you were his daddy if you were his
[1:48:29] father it's so amazing how if we were
[1:48:31] the father of some of these men and we
[1:48:33] were the dad and we looked at what a
[1:48:35] child does it's so amazing how human
[1:48:38] love is so different than god's love
[1:48:42] amen
[1:48:45] so quickly
[1:48:48] we would have just marked him off
[1:48:51] so fast we would have just wrote him off
[1:48:54] how quick we are to write people off
[1:48:57] lord forgive me i'm the from the
[1:48:59] guiltiest
[1:49:00] lord forgive me
[1:49:02] how differently god looks at people than
[1:49:04] how we look at people
[1:49:06] and god deserves the heart we see the
[1:49:08] outward appearance
[1:49:10] god doesn't that's right
[1:49:13] amen and sometimes we say why is why are
[1:49:15] they due why are we
[1:49:16] my goodness we we should we if i was in
[1:49:18] charge well that's why you're not
[1:49:22] [Music]
[1:49:26] oh boy i would jacob my look at what's
[1:49:28] happened now it's not just you it's your
[1:49:30] daughter
[1:49:32] how differently we respond than how god
[1:49:35] responds to jacob
[1:49:40] shechem means a place of burdens and
[1:49:42] going back
[1:49:44] and horrible burdens
[1:49:46] comes to this man
[1:49:48] you've disobeyed the lord jacob you've
[1:49:50] never obeyed him you've met you've
[1:49:51] missed everything he said you went the
[1:49:54] opposite direction than he's ever told
[1:49:56] you've just completely ignored him
[1:49:59] look what god says in genesis chapter 35
[1:50:01] verse 1.
[1:50:03] here's god's here's god's rebuke
[1:50:06] you ready for the heavenly father to
[1:50:07] come with the cracking of the whip and
[1:50:10] god said unto jacob
[1:50:12] arise
[1:50:16] go up to bethel
[1:50:19] god hold on
[1:50:21] lord
[1:50:22] aren't you going gonna mention something
[1:50:24] didn't you see what he did
[1:50:27] surely lords are gonna chastise him and
[1:50:29] rebuke him and look what he's done to
[1:50:30] his family
[1:50:33] lord says
[1:50:34] arise
[1:50:36] go up to bethel
[1:50:38] and dwell there
[1:50:41] and make an altar unto god
[1:50:43] that appeared unto thee
[1:50:45] when thou fled us from the face of esau
[1:50:47] thy brother
[1:50:49] he doesn't mention shechem
[1:50:51] he doesn't he doesn't mention the
[1:50:52] mistake
[1:50:54] he does you know so many times we would
[1:50:56] we
[1:50:56] were the ones who always bring up our
[1:50:58] past and bring up our mistakes
[1:51:01] god never mentions any of it
[1:51:03] god just keeps giving you the word
[1:51:06] what's god's gonna say arise wake up
[1:51:08] daughter of zion put on your strength
[1:51:10] old daughter of zion get up out god are
[1:51:12] you gonna give up no i'm never gonna

[1:51:26] walk out on me god i'm never going to

[1:51:29] finally have enough of me and just kick
[1:51:31] me to the side let me make sure it's

[1:51:35] of god he will never ever ever give up

[1:51:42] praying he'll keep encouraging you

[1:56:00] even this morning and several months to
[1:56:03] a month or so ago i was ministering
[1:56:05] brother john andy's church there in
[1:56:07] washington the lord just anointed my
[1:56:09] faith
[1:56:10] and ever since these words were spoken
[1:56:12] the lord just stirred something and
[1:56:13] deposited something down inside of me
[1:56:16] and i knew i'd be preaching it so here i
[1:56:18] am today
[1:56:19] preaching it to you
[1:56:21] i remember just back going back to
[1:56:24] october of last year
[1:56:26] my mind went all the way back i watched
[1:56:28] again even the freshly just to put it
[1:56:30] all back in my memory again
[1:56:32] of the testimony service we had and the
[1:56:34] the testimonies of deliverance for
[1:56:37] sister kathy and brother mark and
[1:56:40] brother jason and the different ones god
[1:56:41] just did miraculous things in our church
[1:56:45] into the body of believers
[1:56:47] and he said as i was studying this
[1:56:49] message and studying these things put on
[1:56:51] your strength
[1:56:52] i was so just just just shook
[1:56:55] even even there and this in the back
[1:56:56] office even hearing it again i just
[1:56:58] weeped and began to break
[1:57:00] and it became more real to me than it
[1:57:02] ever became to me that it ever came to
[1:57:04] me even just this morning as i was just
[1:57:07] reminded of the testimony of brother
[1:57:09] jason specifically when he was in the
[1:57:12] hospital my mind goes back to the two
[1:57:14] o'clock 2 15 in the morning looked at
[1:57:16] the text message call from sister amy
[1:57:19] saying brother matt brother jason he's
[1:57:21] bad he's jason's really his oxygen's
[1:57:23] down in the 80s and and we knew he had
[1:57:25] been sick and he'd been at home
[1:57:27] suffering from covid and and then my dad
[1:57:30] even himself was there at home sick and
[1:57:32] not able to stand up and he would have
[1:57:35] sister amy said someone's got to come
[1:57:36] and get him right now you've got to take
[1:57:38] him to the hospital the emergency room
[1:57:40] right now and i'm trying to wake up and
[1:57:42] trying to process everything that she's
[1:57:44] telling me and i could hear even just
[1:57:46] even through the text messages and i'm
[1:57:48] texting my dad and my dad's sick and
[1:57:51] brother travis who lived close by sister
[1:57:52] deborah they were sick with cove at him
[1:57:54] did we seem like it just went rampant
[1:57:56] through the church 12 or 13 families and
[1:57:59] god had had shown mercy and we i hadn't
[1:58:02] had it yet i was one of the only ones
[1:58:04] the only one in the ministry that
[1:58:06] wasn't sick with it and so my dad said i
[1:58:08] can't go i'm sick i can't even stand up
[1:58:11] right now and and he says you can't go
[1:58:13] get jason because you're the last one
[1:58:15] basically the last man standing and he's
[1:58:18] and i said well brother travis already
[1:58:19] has it brother travis can go and get him
[1:58:20] so i called travis wolf travis up three
[1:58:22] approaching three o'clock in the morning
[1:58:24] and i woke him up and said travis jason
[1:58:26] apparently he's really sick he's he's
[1:58:29] amy's really worried about him you gotta
[1:58:30] take him right now and then he said

[1:58:34] so travis wakes up gets in his car go
[1:58:36] straight to brother jason i'm texting
[1:58:38] brother andrew uh immediately brother

[1:59:00] went back to some of the text messages i
[1:59:02] had with brother andrew and brother
[1:59:04] travis and and and then brother travis
[1:59:07] goes and gets brother jason and takes
[1:59:09] him my brother jason doesn't even well
[1:59:11] remember some of these details we tell
[1:59:12] him and he believes us some of them he
[1:59:14] don't even remember doesn't remember it
[1:59:16] happening

[1:59:29] fine he'll get to the hospital and
[1:59:30] travis is there okay all is well and
[1:59:33] then brother travis calls me and i could
[1:59:35] hear it in his voice
[1:59:37] and he says i
[1:59:38] i i wasn't that really that really got
[1:59:41] to me real bad i said what he said i
[1:59:43] wasn't expecting that brother jason is

[1:59:57] and and and
[1:59:58] and it just really affected him
[2:00:00] and i remember hearing those that voice
[2:00:02] and i thought
[2:00:03] wow
[2:00:05] you know you put it off in your mind
[2:00:07] that anything bad could ever really
[2:00:08] happen brother jason's young and and
[2:00:10] you're thinking there's no there's no
[2:00:12] way you know he'll he'll be fine and
[2:00:14] then brother andrew who every time one
[2:00:16] of our believers here at our church goes
[2:00:17] into the hospital you know we
[2:00:19] communicate brother andrew communicate
[2:00:20] back and he's always positive and always
[2:00:22] oh yeah we got them in there they'll be
[2:00:24] fine and there's always a good message
[2:00:26] of positivity and hope and you know sort
[2:00:28] of put your mind at rest if it can be
[2:00:30] put to rest and
[2:00:32] and i said brother andrew can you give
[2:00:34] me an update can you give me another mr
[2:00:35] amy's waiting on an update can you give
[2:00:36] an update brother just responds he's
[2:00:40] critically ill

[2:00:45] definitely going to be admitted to the
[2:00:47] hospital he's very he's a very sick
[2:00:49] person
[2:00:51] i remember laying there at three three
[2:00:53] o'clock in the morning
[2:00:54] and i'm trying to go back to sleep and
[2:00:56] just pray and me and rachel both just
[2:00:57] prayed i remember laying there and the
[2:00:59] thought just dawned on me and i thought
[2:01:01] it's like you're trying to wrestle with
[2:01:03] this
[2:01:04] this this reality that we could lose
[2:01:06] brother jason
[2:01:08] no
[2:01:10] there's no way his family is all of his
[2:01:11] children that we love sister amy and
[2:01:14] you're thinking of this you know it's
[2:01:15] amazing how close when it hits close to
[2:01:18] home
[2:01:19] how real things become
[2:01:22] people could say what they want about
[2:01:23] this this and this and they speak very
[2:01:25] loosely about covet and how real it is
[2:01:28] and how when it comes really close
[2:01:32] and and i just remember laying there and
[2:01:34] i remember trying this trying struggling
[2:01:36] and just every time i'd wake up i pray
[2:01:38] and waiting for an update waiting for an
[2:01:40] update and you don't there's such a
[2:01:41] realm of the unknown and then days days
[2:01:44] go by and the report comes back and
[2:01:47] and it's just looking bleaker and
[2:01:49] bleaker and and
[2:01:50] brother jason has a condition where
[2:01:53] their sister amy calls the doctor calls
[2:01:55] the nurse and sister amy said i could
[2:01:57] hear the nurse and her voice she was
[2:01:59] fatigued having been up all night with
[2:02:01] jason she says tells amy he doesn't know
[2:02:04] who he is he doesn't know who you are he
[2:02:06] doesn't know what his job is he doesn't
[2:02:08] know any of his kids names could you
[2:02:10] imagine
[2:02:13] and and and i just remembered that as i
[2:02:16] went back in my memory
[2:02:18] and watching sister amy who no doubt
[2:02:21] just the devil's playing with her mind
[2:02:23] trying to tell her every lie of the
[2:02:25] enemy playing with brother j his brother
[2:02:27] jason testified and he said every forget
[2:02:29] the way you were to the brother jd but
[2:02:31] you said every weakness and every
[2:02:33] insecurity i ever had in my in my flesh
[2:02:36] satan attacked every single one of them
[2:02:39] and you do you no doubt you i remember
[2:02:42] that sister amy's saying she could hear
[2:02:44] the voice
[2:02:45] the the voice through the nurse
[2:02:47] and she's struggling and and even in her
[2:02:49] mind you know we're all we're only human
[2:02:53] you're only human
[2:02:55] and we have a tendency to doubt
[2:02:57] even the best of believers in the best
[2:02:59] of times hello
[2:03:03] i never never forget
[2:03:05] sister amy saying that she's beginning
[2:03:07] to just collapse and that morning she
[2:03:09] collapsed and she was a mess and no
[2:03:11] doubt all of the thoughts and all of the
[2:03:13] reality of that situation
[2:03:16] and sister amber comes to her house
[2:03:19] and i'll never forget those words the
[2:03:20] sister amy even is anointed with the
[2:03:23] message perfect faith lord gives her
[2:03:25] that message and there's something
[2:03:27] brother branham says there and
[2:03:29] and and there's a tongues and an
[2:03:30] interpretation and the interpretation of
[2:03:32] those tongues were exactly what she
[2:03:34] needed to hear for brother jason that
[2:03:36] yea the lord shall heal and the lord
[2:03:38] shall perform a miracle and she had
[2:03:40] texted jason and i'll never forget these
[2:03:43] words that sister amy said in her
[2:03:45] testimony she said i knew if i could
[2:03:47] just get jason if i could just get him
[2:03:49] to respond and i could give him the word
[2:03:51] and she said i knew he was in a terrible
[2:03:53] place and he couldn't believe for
[2:03:55] himself and he couldn't believe her
[2:03:57] situation she said but i knew he was a
[2:03:59] believer and i knew that if i could just
[2:04:01] get him the word and get him just to
[2:04:03] agree to it faith would start to take
[2:04:05] place
[2:04:06] and she said jason just responded
[2:04:08] need and she got the message and then a
[2:04:12] few moments later miracle
[2:04:14] need miracle
[2:04:18] the lord gave her an interpretation to a
[2:04:21] prophecy
[2:04:22] and i'm not even going to try to try to
[2:04:23] re rehearse it here but it was something
[2:04:25] to the effect that the miracle yay i'll
[2:04:28] perform what i've spoken yeah i'm god
[2:04:30] i'm a god who i'm the god who healeth
[2:04:32] thee and all thy diseases
[2:04:35] and sister amber comes to her house and
[2:04:36] amy's falling apart and broken even of
[2:04:39] her own self and trying to trying to
[2:04:41] have faith and you try to believe but
[2:04:43] but here she is even in her own flesh
[2:04:45] struggling and sister amber anointed of
[2:04:47] god inspired of god looked at sister amy
[2:04:50] and said sister amy you're gonna have to
[2:04:53] choose
[2:04:54] to believe
[2:04:55] you're going to have to make a choice to
[2:04:58] believe the word of god and sister amy
[2:05:02] said it did something to her i've got to
[2:05:03] make a choice it's one thing to quote
[2:05:06] the word it's one thing to just say the
[2:05:08] word but it's different when you say i
[2:05:10] believe the word of god because i'm a
[2:05:13] believer and she took hold of faith
[2:05:16] [Music]
[2:05:18] the lord inspired me as i heard those
[2:05:20] words again this morning and i just want
[2:05:21] to say this to you this morning church
[2:05:23] if there ever was a time to believe it's
[2:05:27] now if there ever was a time for you to
[2:05:30] be a believer and to cast aside doubt
[2:05:32] and to stand against the fear that's
[2:05:34] being spread in the world today it's
[2:05:37] time for believers to believe the word
[2:05:40] of god
[2:05:42] oh how many could raise a hand and say
[2:05:44] lord i'm going to make a choice
[2:05:47] to put on my strength
[2:05:49] it's inside of me stand to your feet
[2:05:51] with those hands raised and say lord
[2:05:53] i've got to make a choice today i choose
[2:05:56] to
[2:05:58] believe the word
[2:06:00] i'm going to choose to believe
[2:06:02] brother jason is here today
[2:06:05] and his recovery is so supernatural that
[2:06:08] you almost quickly forget the condition
[2:06:11] he was in hardly able to form a sentence
[2:06:14] just last year
[2:06:16] and now he stands here in his right mind
[2:06:18] sharp sharper than attack you say man
[2:06:20] did that man had not man had nothing to
[2:06:23] do with that
[2:06:24] that was god anointing the faith of a
[2:06:27] believer and when a believer who's
[2:06:29] already a believer chooses to believe
[2:06:31] the word
[2:06:33] nothing is impossible
[2:06:35] let me remind you here church you're a
[2:06:38] believer
