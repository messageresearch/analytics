[39:00] didn't even know the direction really
[39:02] that it would go or what Vision I just
[39:04] had the thought come to my mind
[39:06] strengthen the feeble
[39:08] needes amen and so we're going to look
[39:10] and turn to Hebrews chap
[39:16] 12 and verses 12 and 13 we're going to
[39:19] return back to this frequently through
[39:23] the through the service
[39:29] wherefore lift up the hands which hang
[39:31] down and the feeble knees and make
[39:33] straight paths for your feet lest that
[39:36] which is lame be turned out of the way
[39:39] but let it rather be healed amen may the
[39:42] Lord add the blessing to the reading of
[39:43] his word you can be
[39:47] seated of course as we read this we see
[39:50] the scripture says starts with
[39:54] wherefore means on a because of and so
[39:58] then we know that this is connected to
[40:00] the previous thought that came forward
[40:03] which is was about the Lord's
[40:06] correction and we'll read
[40:09] that starting at verse 5 and you have
[40:12] forgotten the exhortation which speaketh
[40:14] unto you as unto children my son despise
[40:18] not thou the chastening of the Lord nor
[40:21] faint when thou art rebuked of him for
[40:23] whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth and
[40:26] scourgeth every son whom he receiveth so
[40:30] we understand that not all things that
[40:33] we go through we think it's because
[40:35] God's angry with us right we take this
[40:38] approach this has happened because God's
[40:40] angry with
[40:42] us I don't want to get ahead of myself
[40:44] but I'm going to lay that here is that's
[40:46] the wrong way to think the wrong way to
[40:48] look at
[40:49] it and we'll we'll I'll leave that there
[40:54] we think that but that's not right
[41:00] verse 7 if you endure chastening God
[41:03] dealth with you as with sons for what
[41:05] son is he whom the father chasteneth not
[41:09] well we live in a day that if you
[41:12] chasing your children you not in South
[41:14] Carolina but in many states you'll wind
[41:16] up in
[41:17] jail you'll wind up having your children
[41:20] taken away from you can you imagine
[41:22] that's the society that we live in we
[41:25] have so
[41:26] departed from
[41:29] anything that's true and foundational
[41:31] and right into total Madness as I think
[41:35] about this you know some things have
[41:37] totally colored the way we look at
[41:42] everything how what is that feminism has
[41:46] colored the way we look at everything
[41:48] and a real man being a man is considered
[41:51] a horrible thing and he shouldn't be
[41:53] manly or Express manhood that's totally
[41:57] against the word of God that's totally
[41:59] against God's vision for family and home
[42:02] this the other part feminism has colored
[42:05] our our minds the other part that's
[42:06] colored our minds is modern
[42:09] psychology everyone has become a pop
[42:12] psychologist this happened because of
[42:13] this thing in my life and this I do this
[42:17] because of this okay but you're
[42:19] responsible for your own actions it may
[42:22] have happened because of that but
[42:24] everyone has an excuse for how they
[42:25] behave because Mom was this and dad was
[42:28] that and grandfather and this and that
[42:30] we know that God visits the sins of the
[42:33] fathers unto the children to many
[42:36] generations but then we've taken this
[42:39] and the scripture says and condemns this
[42:41] thought
[42:42] is the fathers eat sour grapes and the
[42:46] children's teeth are set on edge and God
[42:48] says everyone will die for his own
[42:52] sins so to get that idea in this pop
[42:56] psychology World well this explains a
[42:59] lot it helps me to understand because my
[43:01] dad was this and was that that's TR that
[43:03] might be true it might not be true to it
[43:06] might simply because you're making
[43:07] excuses for
[43:08] yourself and you're not going according
[43:11] to the word of God you're going to
[43:12] answer for what God says God provides
[43:14] the means for healing for deliverance
[43:17] for
[43:18] wholeness you can't just sit there and
[43:21] say my dad my mom Grandpa and then
[43:24] expect to get away with that
[43:26] excuse God Is A Healer God is a
[43:29] deliverer the gospel comes to change us
[43:32] not to leave us in the place blaming
[43:34] something on something hap that happened
[43:36] in the past but that's pop psychology
[43:38] and even even if you examine it closely
[43:42] much of our pop psychology that we see
[43:44] that's accepted in the world even
[43:46] psychologists say it's nonsense which
[43:49] psychologist psychology is all based on
[43:53] Marxism
[43:55] and uh uh modernistic feminism and so we
[44:02] we have to understand God deals with you
[44:05] as with a son when you're being
[44:08] chastened now we we see that and we read
[44:11] that we can't imagine how that could be
[44:13] if God loves us he he just Pats us and
[44:15] babies us and and does everything nice
[44:18] for
[44:19] us no he's raising children to be mature
[44:24] sons and therefore he corrects
[44:28] us he spanks us spare the rod and spoil
[44:31] the child so God spanks us I remember uh
[44:35] Amy always telling the girls we don't
[44:38] get physical spankings anymore like you
[44:41] you're getting uh when they were younger
[44:44] and but God still deals with us and
[44:47] gives us spankings amen and that's his
[44:49] love because if you're without
[44:51] chastisement where of all our partakers
[44:54] then are you bastards and not Sons
[44:56] can I just say this we're filled with a
[44:58] world and America of bastards yeah they
[45:02] live and act like bastards even if
[45:04] they're even if they have their father
[45:06] around they're acting like a bunch of
[45:08] bastards why because they have no
[45:10] correction and they cannot stand
[45:12] chastisement if they're corrected they
[45:14] will let you know I do I never need to
[45:17] be corrected thank you I am always right
[45:20] and I always look at everything right
[45:22] and I always see everything right you're
[45:24] a fool that's what you are that's
[45:27] right furthermore verse 9 we have had
[45:31] fathers of our flesh which corrected us
[45:34] and we gave them reverence shall we not
[45:36] much rather be in subjection unto the
[45:38] father of spirits and
[45:41] live my for they verily for a few days
[45:44] chasen us after their own pleasure but
[45:47] he for our profit that we might be
[45:49] partakers of his
[45:54] Holiness now no chastening for the
[45:56] present seeth to be joyous but Grievous
[45:59] nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the
[46:02] Peaceable fruit of righteousness unto
[46:04] them which are exercised
[46:07] thereby all right so we see
[46:12] that God brings to correction to us in
[46:16] our lives and the corre correction that
[46:19] he's bringing to us actually could cause
[46:22] us to faint the Bible says don't faint
[46:24] when you're corrected
[46:26] but it it there is that he's he's saying
[46:30] that because there is that possibility
[46:32] that we would faint because we see the
[46:34] circumstances and we apply the wrong
[46:37] thing to the circumstances and it leads
[46:39] us to look at it differently and we I
[46:42] give up I can't go on he says don't do
[46:45] that the correction is described as
[46:48] something that does not seem joyous but
[46:52] rather Grievous the NLT says no
[46:54] discipline is enjoyable while it's
[46:56] happening it's
[47:00] painful so I want to come back to what
[47:04] the discipline is to produce because
[47:06] that's what the scripture says there but
[47:07] first I want to look more at this
[47:11] painful Grievous correction that God
[47:14] gives to us out of love I think brother
[47:18] Caleb really if you listen to the Sunday
[47:20] school if you didn't go listen to it he
[47:22] laid the foundation for today's message
[47:24] I love when the Lord puts that together
[47:26] you know in the denominational World
[47:28] they get together with meetings and all
[47:30] the Sunday School people and everyone
[47:32] coordinates with the pastor what they're
[47:34] going to talk about we don't have to do
[47:35] that we just coordinate with the Holy
[47:37] Spirit and he works everything else
[47:40] out not that there would be anything
[47:42] wrong with coordinating that but simply
[47:44] just to say the grace of the Lord you
[47:47] see when he directs
[47:49] us uh
[47:54] psalm
[47:57] there we go get caught up
[48:00] there Psalms
[48:03] 118 Verse
[48:05] 18 the Lord hath chastened me sore but
[48:09] he hath not given me over unto
[48:12] death so the Lord can chasen a
[48:16] sore some and sometimes he does and
[48:18] again I before I go forward I want to
[48:21] make this statement is
[48:24] that two things things one is when you
[48:27] look when you preach about this everyone
[48:30] starts to get nervous and think the
[48:32] preacher is going to point out that I'm
[48:35] going through what I went through
[48:37] because of the sin in my life the
[48:39] preacher is not going to do that today
[48:42] the preacher is just going to preach the
[48:43] word right the word applies we don't
[48:46] want to be so soft soaped that we think
[48:48] we have to be padded and babied say we
[48:51] go we go we all go through
[48:54] things because of of the sins that we
[48:57] commit and God is correcting us because
[48:59] of that we'll look at that more but I
[49:02] also want you to understand is sometimes
[49:05] it's just a tri predestinated trial that
[49:07] you're supposed to go through but even
[49:09] in that situation God is beating off the
[49:12] dross he's beating off the Flesh and the
[49:16] attributes of the flesh that you still
[49:18] have in your life he's doing that and so
[49:20] when he's chastening us
[49:23] sore know that that's his love
[49:26] amen Psalm 119 verse 67 before I was
[49:30] afflicted I went astray but now have I
[49:34] kept Thy word
[49:36] h Affliction comes and it causes us to
[49:40] know I need to I need to stay and stand
[49:43] by the word I need to to go with what
[49:46] God says not with what I think what I
[49:49] want to do because ultimately what what
[49:51] why did the Affliction come you were
[49:54] going astray
[49:56] so is that God's hatred for you does
[50:00] that mean God's angry with you that
[50:01] means he loves you because you're going
[50:04] astray and he's going to keep you in the
[50:09] way Psalm
[50:11] 11971 it is good for me that I have been
[50:14] Afflicted that I that I might learn thy
[50:21] statutes now there's really
[50:24] no there's no other way it's through the
[50:27] preaching of the word we learn this the
[50:30] word of God the statutes but it's also
[50:32] through the afflictions that we face in
[50:34] our life you're not going to learn any
[50:36] other way it's when the word God gives
[50:39] you a promise let's just simplify it God
[50:41] gives you a promise he never under any
[50:44] circumstances even in Paradise gives you
[50:47] a promise and a commandment and doesn't
[50:50] put some kind of trial in the way to
[50:53] test whether you believe that word or
[50:56] not even in the Garden of Eden where it
[50:59] was perfect God tested whether they
[51:02] believed the promise whether they would
[51:05] follow the
[51:06] word and so anytime God gives you the
[51:09] word trials will come if you don't obey
[51:12] that word afflictions
[51:14] come so either way you're going to get
[51:17] trials and get get Affliction you say
[51:20] that's not fair that's not right I'm
[51:21] just telling quoting you to what the
[51:23] word says this is the life this is the
[51:26] experience of the Life of Christ and
[51:28] we'll never know him until that word is
[51:31] tested in
[51:33] us we know him in the power of His
[51:36] Resurrection The Fellowship of his
[51:37] sufferings being made conformable unto
[51:40] his death so it doesn't just say knowing
[51:44] him in the power of his resurrection
[51:46] we'd all be happy and thankful if that's
[51:47] all that there was but it continues on
[51:50] and it says that in the we know him in
[51:53] the fellowship of his sufferings
[51:56] so when we are facing afflictions we're
[51:58] facing trials that is the place that we
[52:02] know him more now this is where the
[52:04] problem comes in in our minds and in our
[52:07] understanding is that we value comfort
[52:10] more than we value knowing god that's
[52:14] the problem we want to be babied we want
[52:17] to be padded we want it to be simple we
[52:19] want it to be easy and it's just not
[52:22] that way that is not what God has
[52:25] ordained for this life he's not made it
[52:28] so that you would be babied he's made it
[52:30] so that you would be a reflection of
[52:31] Christ now if you just want to go the
[52:33] way of the world and follow follow the
[52:36] devil and the
[52:37] world have it your way but the the path
[52:41] of knowing god is the path of Trials and
[52:44] affliction because he loves you he has
[52:46] an end in sight for you his love isn't
[52:50] simply oh I just pour out the blessings
[52:52] and the money fills your bank account
[52:55] and you drive the best cars I mean
[52:57] that's what the the charismatic movement
[52:59] would have you to believe but it's false
[53:01] Doctrine it's a
[53:02] lie God provides God meets your needs
[53:06] but sometimes God takes you through
[53:08] terrible and horrible things he might
[53:10] take you through losing everything but
[53:13] what will you gain everything the real
[53:16] thing what is the real thing knowing him
[53:20] loving him there's nothing better than
[53:22] that and so when we get we struggle is
[53:26] because we're looking we're
[53:28] valuing something that's wrong we're
[53:31] valuing something outside of
[53:35] God Psalms
[53:39] 1821 for I have kept the ways of the
[53:41] Lord and have not wickedly departed from
[53:45] my
[53:46] God okay David you haven't wickedly
[53:50] departed from your god I've got some
[53:52] stories to tell okay so what is he
[53:54] saying so what is he saying here what is
[53:57] David saying is David David didn't just
[54:01] simply leave God behind he didn't say
[54:04] you know what I don't believe this
[54:05] anymore I don't he he sinned absolutely
[54:10] but he didn't wickedly depart from God
[54:13] as in he says I don't believe it I don't
[54:14] accept it when he was confront he made a
[54:17] horrible mistake I
[54:19] mean it's beyond measure the Bible
[54:23] ordains death for him double
[54:26] death he he achieved the death penalty
[54:29] twice in one
[54:31] case and God pardoned his sin and
[54:34] forgave him but he didn't wickedly
[54:36] depart from God he he made a horrible
[54:38] mistake but he didn't lose his faith he
[54:41] simply sinned against God see and so
[54:45] when we're talking about this Affliction
[54:48] this trial these things that we're going
[54:50] through we're not talking about someone
[54:52] that's just walked away from God but
[54:55] someone who through the weakness of the
[54:56] Flesh and the infirmities of the mind we
[54:59] go astray we sin each one of us does
[55:03] that as long as we're here in this flesh
[55:07] we are going to sin it's not until this
[55:10] is a new body now he's growing us and
[55:14] there should be a pro procession of
[55:16] growth in our life but we're never going
[55:19] to achieve sinlessness until this body
[55:23] is changed to be like an unto Jesus
[55:25] glorious
[55:27] body 1 John chapter 1 if we say that we
[55:32] have no sin we deceive ourselves and the
[55:34] truth is not in us if we confess our
[55:36] sins he is faithful and just to forgive
[55:38] us our sins and to cleanse us from all
[55:42] unrighteousness if we say that we have
[55:43] not sinned we make him a liar and his
[55:47] word is not in us we all we all sin and
[55:52] I think the closer you are in your walk
[55:55] with the Lord the greater awareness you
[55:58] have of your your own weakness and your
[56:01] own sin but thank God there is a remedy
[56:06] if we walk in the light as he is in the
[56:08] light he's faithful and just to forgive
[56:11] us of our sins and to cleanse us from
[56:13] all
[56:15] unrighteousness through that blood we
[56:17] are changed and
[56:19] transformed
[56:22] amen so God uses afflictions and trials
[56:27] to lovingly correct us they're painful
[56:29] they're Grievous they're not pleasant
[56:32] for the
[56:34] moment but I want to I want to talk
[56:36] about this I want to look at job as an
[56:39] example I want you to understand when
[56:41] I'm when I'm speaking of this I'm not
[56:43] trying to paint every Affliction and
[56:46] trial that you're going through it's
[56:47] because it's because you've sined you
[56:49] better figure it out you want to we want
[56:51] to live in Grace right we want to
[56:54] understand understand the grace of God
[56:56] and too often we get so tied up in this
[57:01] idea that if I'm if I'm living like this
[57:04] I'm not going to make it well if you're
[57:06] living like that as an expression of who
[57:09] you are on the inside of the inside if
[57:12] you're living wrong from that then
[57:14] you're not going to make it but if
[57:16] you've made a
[57:17] mistake if you're walking with God you
[57:20] love the Lord you've made a mistake you
[57:22] can't be in this position where you're
[57:24] constantly wondering do I have the Holy
[57:25] Ghost do I did I make it did I do this
[57:27] you can't you can never have rest and
[57:30] you can never have peace in your heart
[57:32] if you're constantly wondering well to
[57:36] today I was real good I'll make the
[57:38] Rapture if it happens today but to
[57:40] yesterday if it happened yesterday I
[57:42] wasn't going to make it because I was in
[57:44] the middle of being rude to my family or
[57:46] whatever whatever it might might have
[57:48] been I wasn't in the right you're not
[57:50] ever going to make it by your own works
[57:53] by your own achievements by being good
[57:56] you're not going to good yourself into
[57:58] the
[57:59] Rapture that's what the blood of Jesus
[58:01] Christ is for it cleanses us but the
[58:03] evidence of being cleansed by the blood
[58:05] is that he is changing and transforming
[58:08] us and you're not satisfied with staying
[58:11] in the condition of worldliness and sin
[58:14] you hate it you don't want it and you're
[58:16] seeking God and saying God take this
[58:18] from
[58:19] me that's that's what he's doing in us
[58:23] and we can look to Jo as an example he
[58:26] thought his trial came unjustly because
[58:29] I've done everything that I'm supposed
[58:31] to do so God must be unjust in this no
[58:36] you don't understand job trials don't
[58:39] just come because you've
[58:41] sinned Trials come because God wants to
[58:45] mature us that was job's job La was
[58:49] lacking in
[58:50] Revelation that even the perfect sinless
[58:54] Messiah
[58:55] had to be tried through
[58:58] suffering and had to be made perfect
[59:01] through suffering so no it wasn't it
[59:03] wasn't your sin job it was simply that
[59:06] God was trying you that God had a
[59:08] purpose he wanted to two things he
[59:10] wanted to prove
[59:12] himself to Satan through job and
[59:16] secondly he wanted to bring job to
[59:19] maturity through suffering and we find
[59:22] that woven all throughout the Book of
[59:24] Job
[59:25] there's both of them are understanding
[59:27] God in such a simplistic way if things
[59:29] are
[59:29] easy then you did right if things are
[59:34] bad then you did wrong this is the this
[59:37] is the mentality we still have many
[59:39] times and we're here we're listening to
[59:42] the seventh Church age messenger preach
[59:44] the the sovereignty of God and salvation
[59:47] and the power of God and the what
[59:51] justification really means and we're
[59:52] still thinking this if things are going
[59:54] going bad for me it's because I'm a
[59:57] secret sinner if things are going good
[1:00:00] for me it's because I'm doing right this
[1:00:03] is this is just
[1:00:05] natural for man to look at things and
[1:00:09] think of things this way but the Bible
[1:00:11] says no that's not
[1:00:14] true that's not
[1:00:16] accurate and until we find our rest in
[1:00:19] the fact that the things that we're
[1:00:21] going through are are to mature us and
[1:00:24] to get us closer to Christ we'll
[1:00:27] continually to be relying on our own
[1:00:30] works you'll never be saved by relying
[1:00:32] on your own
[1:00:33] Works how can you think well I I felt a
[1:00:36] good anointing at the service today I'm
[1:00:38] right with God but I felt nothing the
[1:00:40] the next day so I'm not right with God
[1:00:42] stop looking at the outward where is
[1:00:45] your faith do you believe God's word am
[1:00:48] do you believe that you're not saved by
[1:00:50] coming to the Altar and a minister
[1:00:53] laying his hands on you that's never
[1:00:55] what salvation Ever Was supposed to be
[1:00:58] God can use all these things as a means
[1:01:00] but Salvation is not by the altar call
[1:01:02] Salvation is by faith alone in Christ
[1:01:06] alone whatever outward display we have
[1:01:09] God deals with us differently he dealt
[1:01:10] with me in a car all by myself deals
[1:01:13] with some people coming to the altar
[1:01:15] deals with some people right in your
[1:01:17] chair some everybody is different how he
[1:01:20] deals with but it's the same thing that
[1:01:22] he saves Us by and that's Faith amen
[1:01:25] stop this immature nonsense of thinking
[1:01:29] things are bad I'm I did bad well that
[1:01:32] might be true he might be correcting you
[1:01:35] but the fact is if you un if you really
[1:01:38] understand your condition before
[1:01:40] God then you're actually going to
[1:01:45] understand he's trying to make us like
[1:01:47] Christ whether it's my sin or whether
[1:01:50] it's a predestinated trial let's get
[1:01:52] closer to Christ
[1:01:54] you don't well I got to figure out what
[1:01:57] sin it is do you know that God gave you
[1:01:59] the Holy Spirit and he's obligated to
[1:02:01] correct you that verse we just read we
[1:02:04] look at it from our perspective saying
[1:02:07] well God corrects us and it's really
[1:02:10] hard and it's very difficult but from
[1:02:12] God's perspective it means there's a
[1:02:14] actual promise connected that if you're
[1:02:17] a son he will chastise you he will
[1:02:20] correct
[1:02:21] you because what what what is this
[1:02:24] ultimately connected to is that the
[1:02:27] shepherd will not lose one
[1:02:31] sheep he he that's what he
[1:02:35] said I will not lose one you can read it
[1:02:38] I think it's John chapter 10 not one
[1:02:42] sheep will be lost so he's going to do
[1:02:46] what it takes to make sure the Sheep
[1:02:48] gets there in the condition that he
[1:02:50] wants it to get
[1:02:52] there and so he'll correct the Sheep
[1:02:55] he'll he'll he'll he'll give him healing
[1:02:57] ointment he'll bring him to food he'll
[1:02:59] do whatever it takes no matter how how
[1:03:02] difficult how hard the circumstances are
[1:03:04] for him he's going to do
[1:03:07] it no matter how difficult you make it
[1:03:09] for him let's put it that
[1:03:13] way he is going to come after you and he
[1:03:15] is going to get you because it would be
[1:03:17] a shame to the shepherd to lose a sheep
[1:03:21] so he's not going to lose you so if you
[1:03:24] find if you're dealing with
[1:03:27] chastisement then praise God he's
[1:03:30] dealing with you as
[1:03:36] Sons what was job's answer ultimately
[1:03:38] what was job's
[1:03:40] answer God does what he wants
[1:03:44] to that's that's the that's the final
[1:03:46] answer job so you say why did this
[1:03:49] happen to me God does what he wants to
[1:03:52] and he he knows how to produce the the
[1:03:54] right effect in his sheep to make them
[1:03:59] mature right he's bringing us to
[1:04:02] maturity he's perfecting us and so he's
[1:04:05] going to bring those circumstances upon
[1:04:07] you to accomplish those purposes why did
[1:04:09] he do this why did this
[1:04:11] happen y'all I don't
[1:04:16] know I barely have my own stuff figured
[1:04:19] out I don't know what I'm doing I'm all
[1:04:21] I know is one thing is I'm holding God's
[1:04:23] hand amen
[1:04:26] and I believe he's leading
[1:04:28] me that's what's important that's the
[1:04:30] most important
[1:04:32] thing as I said before Jesus
[1:04:35] suffered in order for him to be brought
[1:04:38] to maturity and it was certainly not
[1:04:40] because of the sins that he had
[1:04:43] done at the same time we spoke of
[1:04:46] David David suffered badly in his life
[1:04:50] before he became King when he was
[1:04:52] unworthy really of the suffering he
[1:04:56] suffered why because God was using that
[1:04:58] to bring him to maturity so that when he
[1:05:01] would become king he would be the kind
[1:05:03] of King that God wanted him to be but
[1:05:05] then later in in
[1:05:07] life the sword was never to depart from
[1:05:10] his home because he sinned in the matter
[1:05:12] of Uriah the hittite that was reaping
[1:05:15] what he sowed you're going to reap what
[1:05:17] you sowed right that's not that's simply
[1:05:20] a principle that God has put in place
[1:05:23] you say well God's angry with me because
[1:05:25] no you just are reaping what you sowed
[1:05:28] that doesn't mean God's angry with you
[1:05:30] if you have confessed your sin he's
[1:05:32] faithful and just to forgive your sin
[1:05:34] and to cleanse you from all
[1:05:37] unrighteousness that that's repentance
[1:05:40] you've repented you've turned away from
[1:05:41] it you've asked him to cleanse you it's
[1:05:44] in the sea of forgetfulness never to be
[1:05:46] remembered no more but you'll still have
[1:05:48] consequences for our we have
[1:05:50] consequences for the things that we do
[1:05:55] and there's there's other examples of
[1:05:57] people suffering unjustly and doing it
[1:06:00] and submitting themselves to God and God
[1:06:02] accomplishing a great purpose the
[1:06:04] Apostle Paul he he suffered from
[1:06:07] something he asked God to deliver him
[1:06:08] from it three times and God said my
[1:06:11] power this is given to you keep you
[1:06:14] humble because my power is made perfect
[1:06:17] in
[1:06:19] weakness and so again God has all I'm
[1:06:23] not here to stand and say I can tell you
[1:06:26] all the plans and purposes and
[1:06:28] everything that you're going through
[1:06:29] God's doing this and go I can't do that
[1:06:32] I could lay out to you what the
[1:06:34] scripture
[1:06:35] says it's up to God to show you and
[1:06:38] sometimes he'll just say trust
[1:06:41] me but God I want to know why do you
[1:06:45] trust me that's what he ask us to do go
[1:06:48] through this and trust me and know that
[1:06:52] I have a purpose cuz cuz job
[1:06:54] sat there argued with his buddies back
[1:06:57] and forth they argued and argued and
[1:06:59] everybody had the right point and at the
[1:07:01] end who came and made the final
[1:07:03] statement I'm he he said I'm God I do
[1:07:08] what I want to basically that's that's
[1:07:10] the summary of all that he
[1:07:14] said I can do exactly what I want to and
[1:07:16] you have nothing to say about it that's
[1:07:19] Faith that's trust because we know the
[1:07:22] character of God we know that he's doing
[1:07:24] something we know his promises we know
[1:07:27] what he says and so we can just grab
[1:07:28] hold and move
[1:07:30] forward second Corinthians chapter
[1:07:35] 7 verse 9 now I Rejoice not that you
[1:07:39] were made sorry but that you sorrowed to
[1:07:42] repentance for you were made sorry after
[1:07:44] a Godly manner that you might receive
[1:07:47] damage by us in
[1:07:49] nothing verse 10 for Godly sorrow
[1:07:51] worketh repentance to Salvation not to
[1:07:53] be repented of but the sorrow of the
[1:07:56] world Works
[1:07:58] death verse 11 behold the selfsame thing
[1:08:01] that you sorrowed after a Godly sort
[1:08:03] what carefulness it wrought in you yay
[1:08:06] what clearing of yourselves yay what
[1:08:08] indignation yay What Fear yay what
[1:08:10] vehement desire yay what Zeal yay what
[1:08:13] revenge in all things you have approved
[1:08:16] yourselves to be clear in this matter so
[1:08:20] there is
[1:08:21] correction that God brings that leads to
[1:08:28] sorrow and that's supposed to lead to
[1:08:30] repentance right God is that's his love
[1:08:34] he's bringing a spanking it hurts and
[1:08:36] you're supposed to repent other this
[1:08:38] otherwise the spanking just keeps
[1:08:41] coming you
[1:08:43] repent you turn to God and you walk
[1:08:45] forward right it's a great blessing from
[1:08:48] God that he deals with us this way it
[1:08:51] means that he's trying to produce
[1:08:54] himself in
[1:08:55] us and again none of these things are to
[1:08:58] be considered God the wrath of God upon
[1:09:00] his
[1:09:01] children the wrath of God never comes
[1:09:04] upon his children because Christ himself
[1:09:07] took the wrath upon
[1:09:10] himself Christ took our sins upon
[1:09:14] himself and he was
[1:09:17] punished by God's anger in our place so
[1:09:21] as far as we're concerned God's anger is
[1:09:24] done it's finished when Christ said it's
[1:09:27] finished on the cross it was
[1:09:30] finished he took your place you don't
[1:09:32] have to experience God's
[1:09:36] Wrath you say well how do I know the
[1:09:38] difference between God's corrective love
[1:09:41] and God wanting to prove something
[1:09:44] through my
[1:09:46] life that's difficult to
[1:09:49] answer God will deal with you God will
[1:09:52] show you if he's wanting to correct you
[1:09:54] with something I'm I'm pretty sure I'm
[1:09:56] well acquainted with stuffing sin and
[1:10:00] not not wanting to make it right and God
[1:10:03] putting his thumb on
[1:10:04] me and making it known the way he wants
[1:10:08] to make it
[1:10:09] known and me having to to make those
[1:10:11] things right I'm pretty sure if you're a
[1:10:14] Son of God if you're a daughter of God
[1:10:16] you're probably acquainted with that so
[1:10:18] God has your number he knows where you
[1:10:21] live he knows where you're at and he
[1:10:24] will deal with you and he will correct
[1:10:26] you instead of holding on to that and
[1:10:28] trying to just let
[1:10:31] go God will deal with
[1:10:33] you there's no sin too great that God
[1:10:37] can't heal and God can't
[1:10:43] deliver obviously there's consequences
[1:10:45] for what we do but yet we know that God
[1:10:48] heals God delivers God forgives how do
[1:10:52] we know the difference well God is
[1:10:55] dealing with you to make you like Jesus
[1:10:56] Christ just like we said said either by
[1:10:59] correction or by
[1:11:01] trials if you're
[1:11:03] confused don't ask me ask God because he
[1:11:07] wants to lead you he wants to deal with
[1:11:10] you you need to know him in that way
[1:11:13] that you know what he's dealing with you
[1:11:16] about get alone go in go off in the
[1:11:19] woods go somewhere get alone with God
[1:11:22] and let him deal with you let him speak
[1:11:24] with you you know you hear about brother
[1:11:26] brandham having to get away he he has a
[1:11:28] heavy feeling something is is not right
[1:11:31] he he gets away to the woods or he gets
[1:11:33] away to a place where he can pray why
[1:11:35] aren't you why aren't we doing that take
[1:11:37] the time if that heavy feeling comes
[1:11:40] God's trying to speak something to you
[1:11:42] well go and listen let him speak seek
[1:11:45] him and he'll find
[1:11:48] him
[1:11:50] well I'm
[1:11:52] afraid God know no longer loves me due
[1:11:54] to the circumstances of my life or some
[1:11:56] painful thing I
[1:11:59] experienced you've not yet resisted unto
[1:12:03] blood striving against sin you know what
[1:12:05] that means you haven't given your your
[1:12:07] life you haven't died in your fight
[1:12:10] against sin
[1:12:13] yet Christ did in his battle against sin
[1:12:17] he died we're all given a path by God to
[1:12:20] walk and we're all given crosses to bear
[1:12:24] we don't understand why we're going
[1:12:26] through what we're going through that
[1:12:28] sometimes it's supposed to be that way
[1:12:30] so that you walk by faith and not by
[1:12:33] sight sman Church age chapter 4 brother
[1:12:35] brandham says you see they could not
[1:12:37] figure out God's
[1:12:42] love here we can read along together
[1:12:45] yeah you see they could not figure out
[1:12:47] God's love they thought that love meant
[1:12:49] no suffering they thought that love
[1:12:52] meant a baby with parental care but God
[1:12:54] said that his love was elective love the
[1:12:57] proof of his love is election that no
[1:12:59] matter what happened his love was proven
[1:13:01] truly by the fact that they were chosen
[1:13:03] un unto salvation because because God
[1:13:06] hath chosen you to Salvation through
[1:13:08] sanctification of the spirit and belief
[1:13:11] of the
[1:13:13] truth it's not circumstances that you're
[1:13:16] saved by it's not thinking that you're
[1:13:19] blessed by God it's not feeling an
[1:13:22] anointing that you're saved by you're
[1:13:24] saved by faith do you believe that Jesus
[1:13:27] Christ died for your sins that he's
[1:13:29] given you the holy
[1:13:31] spirit it's through faith that you're
[1:13:33] saved so my circumstance you don't
[1:13:37] understand my circumstances I might not
[1:13:39] but somebody else might but whether I
[1:13:41] understand the circumstances or not I do
[1:13:44] understand God's word and God's word
[1:13:47] declares it's not by your situation do
[1:13:49] you know that you he loves you but that
[1:13:52] it's by the word
[1:13:54] that you know that he loves you he has
[1:13:55] said it you receive it that settles
[1:14:00] it that's what faith
[1:14:03] is the approach to God 1955 brother
[1:14:06] brandham says he wants us to if the
[1:14:09] Earthly parents wants us to do well what
[1:14:11] about our Heavenly parent the Lord
[1:14:13] Jesus he has to correct us and the
[1:14:16] scripture says if we cannot stand CH
[1:14:18] chastisement or a whipping child
[1:14:20] correction then we become illegitimate
[1:14:22] children and not the children of God see
[1:14:26] if you're really born again get it now
[1:14:29] if you're really born again there's
[1:14:30] nothing can separate you from God that's
[1:14:32] right neither starvation perils trials
[1:14:35] suffering death nothing can separate us
[1:14:38] from the love of God which is in Christ
[1:14:42] Jesus you see how we connected that
[1:14:44] together regardless even if it is
[1:14:48] correction over your sin in your life
[1:14:51] that's between you and God that's not
[1:14:53] and and and and again based on
[1:14:56] experience I've seen churches I've seen
[1:14:58] pastors this doesn't happen here but it
[1:15:01] happens it has happened where something
[1:15:03] horrific happens in someone's life and
[1:15:06] that pastor says see you weren't
[1:15:08] respecting the church you weren't doing
[1:15:10] this this happened because of that what
[1:15:13] a reproach and it's caused people to to
[1:15:17] walk away from everything because they
[1:15:19] thought God hated me because of this
[1:15:21] happened that's not the truth
[1:15:23] right it's not God's anger cuz there's
[1:15:27] nothing can separate you from the love
[1:15:29] of God in Christ Jesus No Angel no devil
[1:15:33] no preacher no nothing and that has to
[1:15:37] be your experience and you have to say
[1:15:39] no matter what anybody says I don't care
[1:15:42] if the whole world turns against me I
[1:15:43] don't care if my pastor turns against me
[1:15:45] and the whole church kicks me out God's
[1:15:48] word is true if everybody turns against
[1:15:52] the message I'm going to stand with the
[1:15:56] word that has to be your conviction
[1:15:58] you're not doing this because of what so
[1:16:00] and so is doing so and so this one over
[1:16:02] here if brother Jack stays faithful I'm
[1:16:04] going to stay faithful no we we believe
[1:16:08] God Trials Come whether it's for
[1:16:11] correction or for a simply a trial
[1:16:14] nothing will separate you from the love
[1:16:16] of God even that trial in itself we know
[1:16:20] for a fact it's the love of God when
[1:16:23] well it's because I sinned it's the love
[1:16:25] of God well it's not it's because I
[1:16:29] because he's just giving me a trial to
[1:16:30] mature me it's the love of God either
[1:16:34] way you have to understand that what is
[1:16:37] coming to you is God's love to make you
[1:16:40] more like Jesus Christ to conform you to
[1:16:43] him and to prevent you from going in a
[1:16:46] direction that you shouldn't
[1:16:47] go sometimes we get to a thing and we we
[1:16:50] we have 10 different leadings from the
[1:16:53] the
[1:16:55] Lord I must do this I must do that I
[1:16:58] have to go there and it sometimes you
[1:17:01] feel like am I schizophrenic what's
[1:17:03] going on Lord I want to know what you
[1:17:06] want me to
[1:17:07] do what does he say to do is simple
[1:17:10] brother brandham tells us and it it's
[1:17:12] just the most incredible truth that I've
[1:17:17] ever I've ever read in my life to be
[1:17:21] honest with you about how to find the
[1:17:22] leading of the Lord
[1:17:23] brother Bram says you you lay yourself
[1:17:27] aside you pray you ask God you get
[1:17:30] yourself neutral about it then when you
[1:17:33] get yourself neutral what what direction
[1:17:35] should I go Lord you get yourself
[1:17:37] neutral if the L he said sometimes the
[1:17:39] Lord will deal with by visions well not
[1:17:42] me that's how brother Bram was dealt
[1:17:44] with he said not everybody's that way
[1:17:46] but as you're praying sometimes you're
[1:17:48] leaning towards that you're leaning
[1:17:49] towards that but when you get there he
[1:17:51] said wait on the Lord and wait
[1:17:54] and then
[1:17:55] wait and wait right because it's in the
[1:17:58] waiting where the Lord will correct us
[1:18:00] and redirect us but when you've waited
[1:18:02] on him you've prayed you've got yourself
[1:18:05] neutral you're leaning towards a
[1:18:06] direction brother Bram says if you start
[1:18:08] going towards the direction because
[1:18:11] you've done what you know you're
[1:18:13] supposed to do God is obligated to
[1:18:16] correct you to stop you from going the
[1:18:19] wrong direction and so what he'll do is
[1:18:22] he'll s trials he'll send afflictions
[1:18:25] he'll send a hedge of thorns to direct
[1:18:28] you back to the way that you're supposed
[1:18:29] to
[1:18:30] go either way it's the love of God do
[1:18:33] you see what I'm saying if we're if
[1:18:35] we're seeking him he's we're going to go
[1:18:38] through trials if we're not seeking him
[1:18:41] he's going to correct us with trials so
[1:18:44] either way what are we going to do we're
[1:18:46] going to be more like Jesus
[1:18:49] Christ in the approach to God 1955 say
[1:18:53] brother brandom I'm a Christian and I
[1:18:55] got a sickness
[1:18:58] now I wonder why it come God may be
[1:19:02] purging you amen give you some trials
[1:19:04] make you draw a little closer to him
[1:19:06] pray a while then heal you that you can
[1:19:09] have a
[1:19:10] testimony
[1:19:12] amen Romans
[1:19:14] 5 verse 2 by whom also we have access by
[1:19:19] faith into this grace wherein we stand
[1:19:21] and rejoice in Hope of the glory of God
[1:19:24] and not only so but we glory in
[1:19:26] tribulations also knowing that
[1:19:28] tribulation worketh patience and
[1:19:31] patience experience and experience hope
[1:19:33] and hope maketh not ashame because the
[1:19:35] love of God is shed abroad in our hearts
[1:19:38] by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us
[1:19:41] so we see again there's a there is a
[1:19:44] procedure that the Bible has for getting
[1:19:47] you to this place where the love of God
[1:19:50] is shed abroad in your hearts there's a
[1:19:52] there's a process that God takes you
[1:19:55] through through trials through
[1:19:58] tribulations tribulations produce what
[1:20:02] patience what does p patience produce
[1:20:05] experience in other words it furthers
[1:20:07] your experience with God you know God
[1:20:10] more
[1:20:11] intimately you know if if if life is
[1:20:15] just easy for you how much do you really
[1:20:19] know
[1:20:20] God how much do you understand
[1:20:23] who he is not
[1:20:25] much but as you go through life as you
[1:20:27] struggle as you go through trials and
[1:20:30] afflictions you know him more and more
[1:20:32] and that's where your experience
[1:20:35] increases and that's where your hope
[1:20:38] then increases now hope doesn't mean a
[1:20:40] wish in the Bible hope means an Earnest
[1:20:45] expectation amen and it's directly
[1:20:47] connected with faith faith hope and love
[1:20:51] right so there's there's an Earnest
[1:20:53] expectation of what that God is going to
[1:20:55] do what he said he will do he has a
[1:20:58] promise for you you hold on to that no
[1:21:01] matter what no matter what circumstances
[1:21:02] no matter how long it takes you hold on
[1:21:05] why because God said so that settles
[1:21:14] it but I want you to think about
[1:21:18] this I I think too so many times we
[1:21:20] think about trials and we think about
[1:21:24] afflictions and we think about it wrong
[1:21:26] we think about it about how y'all are
[1:21:28] looking right now man this guy's
[1:21:29] preaching on trials and
[1:21:32] afflictions wouldn't you shut up about
[1:21:36] that well you're living it and I'm
[1:21:38] living it I want to preach where you're
[1:21:40] at because this is where I'm
[1:21:42] at the Holy Ghost dispensation we're
[1:21:45] actually called higher than job we're
[1:21:49] not called to argue with our friends
[1:21:51] about why we're going through what we're
[1:21:52] going through or argue with
[1:21:54] ourselves about why we're going through
[1:21:57] what we're going through we're called
[1:21:58] much
[1:22:01] higher 1 Peter 412 and 13 beloved think
[1:22:05] it not strange concerning the fely fiery
[1:22:08] trial which is to try you as though some
[1:22:10] strange thing happened unto you aren't
[1:22:13] we we're always shocked something
[1:22:16] difficult's happen and we're just under
[1:22:17] a shock how could this happen Peter says
[1:22:20] don't do that don't think it's true
[1:22:23] strange but Rejoice see that's the
[1:22:27] that's the higher calling that we have
[1:22:29] under the Holy Ghost dispensation we're
[1:22:32] not called under job's dispensation to
[1:22:34] argue about it we're called to rejoice
[1:22:37] in it what a difference rejoice in as
[1:22:40] much as you are partakers of Christ's
[1:22:42] sufferings that when his glory shall be
[1:22:45] revealed you may be glad also with
[1:22:48] exceeding Joy amen 2 Corinthians 1:7 and
[1:22:52] our hope of you is steadfast knowing
[1:22:54] that as you are partakers of the
[1:22:55] suffering so shall you also of the
[1:22:59] consolation if you're a partaker of
[1:23:01] suffering you can automatically say
[1:23:03] hallelujah I'm going to be a partaker of
[1:23:06] the
[1:23:06] consolation because why because God said
[1:23:09] so God promised I will receive Comfort
[1:23:15] am James 1
[1:23:20] 2-4 dear brothers and sisters when
[1:23:22] Troubles of any kind come your way
[1:23:24] consider an opportunity for great joy
[1:23:27] for you know that when your faith is
[1:23:29] tested your endurance has a chance to
[1:23:32] grow so let it grow for when your
[1:23:34] endurance is fully developed you will be
[1:23:37] perfect and complete needing nothing see
[1:23:41] this is the
[1:23:42] end that's what God is leading us to
[1:23:45] that's what tribulations and troubles
[1:23:48] that come our way there for a purpose we
[1:23:51] can know as Christians
[1:23:53] this is for a purpose this is not
[1:23:55] meaningless what I'm going through God
[1:23:57] is working something in me for his
[1:24:00] eternal
[1:24:02] purposes whether it merely be a in this
[1:24:07] life that he's making us more like Jesus
[1:24:09] Christ or he actually could be creating
[1:24:13] a crown for us in that new body if we
[1:24:18] pass this trial if we pass this
[1:24:21] Affliction it will cause us not only to
[1:24:23] grow in this life but it'll produce a
[1:24:25] reward in Heavenly places in Christ
[1:24:30] Jesus there's
[1:24:32] absolutely I want to start to turn a
[1:24:34] corner there's absolutely no such thing
[1:24:37] as a true perfected faith that would
[1:24:40] come without trials afflictions
[1:24:43] difficulties broken hearts tears and
[1:24:47] pain we are ordained to go through such
[1:24:51] I don't think we need to to go into the
[1:24:53] scriptures on that it's so clear we're
[1:24:55] ordained to go through trials and
[1:24:57] tribulations and sufferings the devil is
[1:25:00] against us the world is against us they
[1:25:04] hate the word of God and they're
[1:25:06] battling against it because you're
[1:25:08] living by the word by by default the
[1:25:11] devil and the world is against
[1:25:13] you we're ordained to grow through these
[1:25:16] things but God takes them and harnesses
[1:25:20] them to use them to mold you and shape
[1:25:22] you so that you would become
[1:25:25] strong it's not God's Wrath against you
[1:25:27] it's his love to ensure that you come
[1:25:31] out like Jesus
[1:25:37] Christ now let's look at those verses we
[1:25:41] read
[1:25:44] before no chastening for the present
[1:25:48] when you're going through it it's not
[1:25:51] joyful right
[1:25:52] it's painful yeah but actually there
[1:25:55] should be something according to the
[1:25:58] scripture there should be something down
[1:26:01] further than on the outside on the
[1:26:04] inside of the inside that there would be
[1:26:07] a joyfulness raise up now you say I'm
[1:26:10] not there yet I'm probably not there yet
[1:26:13] either but guess what I believe that God
[1:26:15] is bringing us to this that when we go
[1:26:18] through trials and afflictions that it
[1:26:20] goes from being drudger
[1:26:23] to being joyful do we say we thank God
[1:26:26] for the promise instead of looking oh my
[1:26:29] it's horrible what I don't know what to
[1:26:31] do we look ahead to the promise of
[1:26:35] consolation and
[1:26:37] deliverance instead of focusing on the
[1:26:39] problem if you look ahead to The Promise
[1:26:42] You Can Be Joyful if you focused on the
[1:26:46] circumstance it's it's just painful and
[1:26:48] it's not it's Grievous but we're called
[1:26:51] higher
[1:26:54] amen I believe he's training us to go
[1:26:59] higher so that there's this joy in the
[1:27:02] it's not because we're
[1:27:04] masochists we don't want to go through
[1:27:07] the bad thing the the hard things the
[1:27:09] trials but we know that we're looking at
[1:27:11] a promise and so we can Rejoice I think
[1:27:16] most of the problems fall away when we
[1:27:19] can look to the promise and rejoice
[1:27:21] instead of just focusing on I have this
[1:27:23] problem I have this
[1:27:26] trial most of the trouble is in our the
[1:27:29] battle is in our mind to stay in perfect
[1:27:32] peace because why the devil wants us to
[1:27:36] worry about and try to fix our
[1:27:38] circumstances instead of looking to God
[1:27:40] trusting in Him and let him resolve the
[1:27:46] circumstances I want to look at this in
[1:27:49] the
[1:27:51] NLT as we kind of turn the the corner
[1:27:55] towards closing just turning the corner
[1:27:58] I'm not saying I'm closing very soon
[1:28:00] we're just turning the corner in that
[1:28:05] direction I'm not going to be like
[1:28:07] brother digs you know he starts and
[1:28:09] preaches 5 minutes he says don't get
[1:28:10] scared I'm about fixing the clothes well
[1:28:13] an hour later he still hasn't
[1:28:15] closed and we appreciate that he's not
[1:28:18] because we wouldn't be happy if he
[1:28:19] preached just for 10 minutes
[1:28:22] all right so Paul writing to the Hebrews
[1:28:25] says so take a new grip with your tired
[1:28:28] hands and strengthen your weak knees
[1:28:33] Mark out a straight path for your feet
[1:28:35] so that those who are weak and lame will
[1:28:38] not fall but become
[1:28:41] strong
[1:28:43] so in all of this we understand that
[1:28:47] this correction because this this this
[1:28:49] is the verses preceding God's correction
[1:28:53] right so God has God has corrected us so
[1:28:56] God is trying to accomplish a purpose
[1:28:59] what purpose so that we would become
[1:29:01] strong I get this picture in my head I
[1:29:04] don't know if you've all have seen this
[1:29:07] but there's this uh this little German
[1:29:11] advertisement where an old grandfather
[1:29:14] he starts out he's so weak and through
[1:29:17] the year he begins to lift up this
[1:29:19] kettle bell and he's just taken the
[1:29:20] kettle bell and he's lifted it up and
[1:29:22] everybody's like what's this crazy old
[1:29:24] man doing he's doing it no matter what
[1:29:26] rain shine no matter what he's doing it
[1:29:29] but little by little he's doing this and
[1:29:31] he's becoming stronger and becoming
[1:29:32] stronger and at the end then he's able
[1:29:35] to lift his granddaughter up so she
[1:29:37] could put the star on top of the
[1:29:38] Christmas tree but the point being is
[1:29:40] that's the picture I'm getting in his
[1:29:42] mind you're in a condition this this is
[1:29:45] saying feeble
[1:29:47] knees we weak grip so think of that
[1:29:50] you've you've come to this this
[1:29:52] condition in your walk with the Lord
[1:29:54] where your knees are
[1:29:56] feeble that's not where the Lord wants
[1:29:57] you to be he wants you to be at the end
[1:29:59] he wants you to become strong so what
[1:30:01] it's going to do he says take a new grip
[1:30:04] your hands might be weak but start
[1:30:06] taking a
[1:30:07] grip strengthen your knees how do you do
[1:30:10] that just you have to make a flat path
[1:30:12] and start walking that's what you have
[1:30:15] to do make that path straight and just
[1:30:18] start walking and what will happen
[1:30:20] you'll get strong that's God's
[1:30:24] purpose your faith muscles might be weak
[1:30:27] you might be in a place where every
[1:30:29] circumstance every trial that comes your
[1:30:32] way you're questioning everything and
[1:30:34] you're wondering what's the purpose
[1:30:36] behind this why is there why is this
[1:30:38] happening I'm saying right now you can
[1:30:40] take this opportunity to take a grip
[1:30:43] take a new grip grab a hold of the word
[1:30:47] of God start walking you don't H you
[1:30:50] don't have to live in in this constant
[1:30:53] worry about your circumstances you can
[1:30:56] change the circumstance you can change
[1:30:59] where your faith is it just takes a
[1:31:02] little
[1:31:03] step take one step today take two
[1:31:05] tomorrow take three the next day take
[1:31:07] four the next day that's the picture
[1:31:10] that you're getting you get in my mind
[1:31:12] feeble knees I see just an old shriveled
[1:31:14] up old man he's just walking around he
[1:31:16] can barely stand up but you begin to say
[1:31:19] okay now sit in that chair stand up and
[1:31:22] every day you start to do a little
[1:31:26] something and and little by little
[1:31:28] instead of being scrunched over like
[1:31:30] this you're like this and then you're
[1:31:32] like this and then you're like this and
[1:31:34] then you're have your hands in the air
[1:31:36] rejoicing because God has made you
[1:31:39] strong you were once lame you were once
[1:31:41] weak you once you couldn't do anything
[1:31:43] you could even hardly lift anything but
[1:31:46] then step by step you went from being
[1:31:49] that weak cowardly Christian that every
[1:31:53] circumstance cows us down and oh my oh
[1:31:57] it's it's horrible he wants you to be a
[1:31:59] joyful
[1:32:00] Christian he wants you to take the
[1:32:02] trials of the afflictions and not be sad
[1:32:05] and and weepy but to rejoice in them
[1:32:08] from your soul not faking it but a
[1:32:11] reality in your heart say how do I get
[1:32:14] there one step and one walk with God at
[1:32:19] at a time every day but if you stop what
[1:32:22] happens when you're working out brother
[1:32:24] Chris what happens what happens to me I
[1:32:27] I'll just say that he's he's more
[1:32:29] consistent than I am what happens to me
[1:32:32] and brother Erin when we stop lifting
[1:32:34] weights we start to get
[1:32:38] weaker all of us you start to get weaker
[1:32:42] you you're you know and that's the
[1:32:44] direction that the world wants to take
[1:32:46] us Bend us over and be weak so that we
[1:32:48] can't do what God wants us to do right
[1:32:52] that's the spiritual Direction the devil
[1:32:54] wants to take each one of us by our
[1:32:55] circumstances so that we don't
[1:32:58] resist amen resistance is where strength
[1:33:01] comes right so you're going to resist
[1:33:04] the devil every day you're going to get
[1:33:07] stronger and stronger and stronger but
[1:33:09] if he just sometimes he just comes with
[1:33:10] a flurry of punches and you're just laid
[1:33:12] low and what happens you just lay down
[1:33:16] and you just get beat instead of
[1:33:18] standing up and say I will not submit to
[1:33:22] you Satan sometimes just saying that out
[1:33:25] loud you can get the strength to walk
[1:33:27] forward and get stronger and get
[1:33:40] stronger Hebrews
[1:33:42] 54 speaks of that but strong meat
[1:33:45] belongs to them that are of full age
[1:33:47] even those who by reason of use have
[1:33:50] their senses exercised
[1:33:52] to discern both good and evil reason of
[1:33:56] you speaks of training literally speaks
[1:33:58] of training so by
[1:34:01] training you're developing the skill to
[1:34:04] recognize between good and evil so that
[1:34:08] this is the hour that we're living in
[1:34:10] God is giving to us not the first
[1:34:13] principles of the doctrine of Christ but
[1:34:15] he's giving us the strong meat the
[1:34:17] Mysteries revealed the seals open
[1:34:22] so that he's giving us that to us so
[1:34:26] that we can be in training to walk in
[1:34:29] strength so that we don't have to be
[1:34:31] beaten down by our circumstances but
[1:34:33] that we can be joyful in the midst of
[1:34:36] them so how do we strengthen our weak
[1:34:40] knees and how do we get a new
[1:34:43] grip I want to look at a quote from
[1:34:46] brother brandom is pretty incredible
[1:34:48] Redemption incompleteness and joy
[1:34:52] I'm trying something for the glory of
[1:34:54] God just asking God to help us to give
[1:34:56] us Souls into the kingdom and Believers
[1:34:59] that will strengthen their faith and
[1:35:01] move up even without anything else just
[1:35:04] will just move right up and say listen
[1:35:07] to that even without anything
[1:35:09] else we'll just move right up and say
[1:35:12] God I believe you on the word that's it
[1:35:15] there is the initial and first and best
[1:35:18] way that's right take God at his word
[1:35:25] amen take God at his word but he doesn't
[1:35:29] finish there then if you can't do that
[1:35:32] then of course God sends other things in
[1:35:36] such as gifts and signs to confirm his
[1:35:38] word to confirm it to every believer
[1:35:41] that's his love so the way that we
[1:35:43] actually strengthen our faith is to move
[1:35:46] out without any move up without anything
[1:35:49] else and say God I believe you you upon
[1:35:52] your promise for me regardless of
[1:35:54] circumstances regardless of Trials
[1:35:56] regardless of how I feel regardless of
[1:35:59] what pain you might be going through you
[1:36:01] just take God at his word you say that
[1:36:04] seems so simple yes it is it's God in
[1:36:09] Simplicity take him at his word that's
[1:36:11] the mature place that he wants us to
[1:36:14] be read listen to Listen to or read
[1:36:17] perfect Faith this is just exactly what
[1:36:20] brother Bam's talking talking about he
[1:36:22] wants you to believe the word from that
[1:36:24] chair that you're sitting in right there
[1:36:26] or the one at your home or the one in
[1:36:27] your car believe his word accept healing
[1:36:30] and go forward and confess it no matter
[1:36:32] what what you see that's what God that's
[1:36:35] the perfect faith says if you had
[1:36:37] perfect Faith you wouldn't need a prayer
[1:36:40] line yeah that's what he's taking us to
[1:36:43] now I believe in prayer lines I believe
[1:36:44] God works through prayer lines if you
[1:36:46] don't have faith enough brother bam says
[1:36:49] he sends gifts such as gifts but he's
[1:36:51] trying to take each of us higher into
[1:36:54] Realms of perfect Faith amen and I don't
[1:36:58] believe in shaming people oh you know if
[1:37:00] you had faith brother Chris you wouldn't
[1:37:02] come to the prayer line no that's
[1:37:04] nonsense that's
[1:37:08] religiosity sometimes I need that we all
[1:37:11] need that we're all in the place where
[1:37:13] we need his grace and his grace is there
[1:37:16] he says even if you can't do that he
[1:37:19] sends a gift your way but what is I
[1:37:22] believe we can we can bring it to this
[1:37:24] point is that he sends those gifts and
[1:37:27] signs so that they would bring you to
[1:37:30] the place that you would be in maturity
[1:37:33] in the word take him at his word and
[1:37:35] just believe it no matter
[1:37:40] what regardless of circumstances
[1:37:42] regardless of how you feel regard I mean
[1:37:47] look I'm not standing here saying hey
[1:37:50] this is what I this this is what I have
[1:37:53] and you guys come come and and get what
[1:37:56] I have I'm standing here preaching this
[1:37:58] I need
[1:38:01] it circumstances sometimes swallow me up
[1:38:04] but that's not where I'm supposed to
[1:38:07] be sometimes my faith gets so weak and I
[1:38:10] I wonder why when God has proven himself
[1:38:13] over and over and over again so
[1:38:16] supernaturally that no one should doubt
[1:38:18] it and
[1:38:19] yet no that not how I'm going to be
[1:38:22] moving forward I'm going to take God at
[1:38:23] his word I'm going to say he said it and
[1:38:25] I'm going forward by faith regardless of
[1:38:28] how I
[1:38:31] feel Isaiah 35 says something like what
[1:38:34] brother brandham says in Hebrews 12 he
[1:38:37] says you take the grip you strengthen
[1:38:40] your knees but here in Isaiah 35 it's
[1:38:44] it's commanding someone to strengthen
[1:38:47] the weak hands and confirm the feeble
[1:38:49] knees say to them them that are of a
[1:38:51] fearful heart be strong fear not behold
[1:38:55] your God will come with vengeance even
[1:38:58] god with a recompense he will come and
[1:39:00] save you
[1:39:02] amen even if you don't have the faith to
[1:39:04] rise above every circumstances God will
[1:39:07] send a minister to you or a Believer to

[1:40:01] Amen in the
[1:40:03] sardian uh Church
[1:40:10] age it brought uh it brought forth a
[1:40:14] free Bible to the people again the
[1:40:16] Lutheran age brought forth a free Bible
[1:40:19] they made their press and begin to give
[1:40:21] the world the Bible God bless the
[1:40:22] lutherans for that yes sir they put the
[1:40:24] Bible back in the lady's hand again was
[1:40:27] just priest alone never even had to look
[1:40:29] at it because it was the pope said and
[1:40:32] he was the god so whatever he said that
[1:40:34] did it so now the Lutheran Revival what
[1:40:37] they wanted to strengthen now you got
[1:40:39] the Bible in your hand Now read it
[1:40:40] believe it don't lay it up on the Shelf
[1:40:42] say well we got a Bible that ain't going
[1:40:44] to do you no
[1:40:46] good there's too many lutherans in
[1:40:49] Pentecost today there's too many
[1:40:50] Lutheran in the message today laying the
[1:40:54] Bible around and taking what somebody
[1:40:56] else says about it brother read the word
[1:40:58] search the scriptures for they are they
[1:41:00] which testify of me said Jesus in them
[1:41:03] you think you have eternal life that's
[1:41:05] the thing to do read the word strengthen
[1:41:10] that's the word if you look if you run
[1:41:11] that back I think it's in the the this
[1:41:14] that church age smean Church age or
[1:41:16] sardian church age he speaks about that
[1:41:20] to strengthen
[1:41:21] strengthen what you have right and this
[1:41:25] is Brother brandom commenting on that
[1:41:26] how are you going to strengthen what you
[1:41:27] have read the Bible read your Bible
[1:41:30] every day look don't just read it to
[1:41:33] check it off the list but really Feast
[1:41:37] on the word take it into your heart take
[1:41:40] God's promises over your circumstances
[1:41:42] read over them again and again and again
[1:41:45] recite them back to the
[1:41:49] devil
[1:41:51] an expectation 1961 brother brandom says
[1:41:53] I look at the way the Pentecostal church
[1:41:55] is getting oh God professing Holiness
[1:41:57] and what Have We Become salt salt that
[1:42:00] lost its Savor God bring back the Savor
[1:42:03] back to the Salt quickly that it might
[1:42:05] contact this rottening world it's a
[1:42:07] Savor if it contexts and it's got life
[1:42:09] in it it'll save God make us savers of
[1:42:12] the world Grant it Lord put the Savor in
[1:42:15] us to strengthen the church that people
[1:42:17] might walk in this door and see the
[1:42:18] power of the resurrection of the Lord
[1:42:21] Jesus moving among the people showing
[1:42:23] himself alive forever more amen may we
[1:42:26] not look to the applaud of the people or
[1:42:28] the opinion of the people or 40,000 in a
[1:42:30] meeting to make a Revival oh God that
[1:42:32] isn't a Revival I pray that the holy
[1:42:34] spirit will get a hold of a few hearts
[1:42:37] and shake the church and cause a real
[1:42:40] Pentecostal Revival Grant it Lord
[1:42:44] amen we'll
[1:42:47] never be able to have the power of the
[1:42:49] Resurrection in our Our Lives if we're
[1:42:52] not walking as triumphant Christians
[1:42:56] that's what God's called us to be is
[1:42:58] walking in Victory not on this level
[1:43:01] where everything's beating us down and
[1:43:03] we can't stand up on our feet that's
[1:43:06] going to come the beating is going to
[1:43:08] come that's not a question we we
[1:43:11] established that there is going to be
[1:43:13] punches thrown your way there's going to
[1:43:15] be kicks there's going to be a battle
[1:43:17] and you're going to have to face it
[1:43:19] whether you like or not but the question
[1:43:23] is not whether you're going to face it
[1:43:25] the question is will you walk in Victory
[1:43:28] will you walk as a triumphant Christian
[1:43:30] or will you let the circumstances beat
[1:43:32] you down so that your faith cannot
[1:43:34] operate and the power of the
[1:43:35] Resurrection will never be manifested in
[1:43:38] your life in that way and we have to
[1:43:41] know him in the power of the his
[1:43:43] resurrection and the fellowship of his
[1:43:46] sufferings it's both together and how
[1:43:49] you'll know him whe When You're Going
[1:43:51] Through The Fellowship of his sufferings
[1:43:53] look at Paul all everything that he he
[1:43:55] wrote To Us everything that we read it
[1:43:57] wasn't someone that had a good and easy
[1:43:59] life many of them are written from
[1:44:01] prison and I'm I'm promise you prison
[1:44:05] now is a pleasure compared to what it
[1:44:07] was in Roman Roman
[1:44:12] times 2 Corinthians
[1:44:16] 2 verse 14 now thanks be unto God
[1:44:21] which always causeth us to Triumph in
[1:44:24] Christ and maketh manifest the Savor of
[1:44:27] his knowledge By Us in every
[1:44:31] place for we are unto God a sweet Savor
[1:44:34] of Christ in them that are saved and in
[1:44:36] them that perish to the one we are the
[1:44:39] Savor of death unto unto death and to
[1:44:42] the other the Savor of Life Savor means
[1:44:45] the
[1:44:46] aroma the aroma of Life unto life and
[1:44:50] who is is sufficient for these things
[1:44:53] Paul asked that at the end who is
[1:44:55] sufficient no no none of us are
[1:44:56] sufficient for it but I want to go back
[1:44:59] to that verse
[1:45:02] 14 thanks be to God so he's giving
[1:45:04] thanks for what which always causes us
[1:45:09] to Triumph in
[1:45:12] Christ you say
[1:45:15] well I don't feel very
[1:45:18] triumphant this verse
[1:45:21] at the end acknowledges that sometimes
[1:45:23] you won't feel very triumphant and at
[1:45:26] the core you're not
[1:45:29] sufficient but this is what this is the
[1:45:32] reality do you believe God's
[1:45:35] word then if you are filled with the
[1:45:39] Holy Spirit and you're one of God's
[1:45:43] elect then we can say categorically that
[1:45:47] in Christ you're always walking in
[1:45:49] Triumph
[1:45:51] no because I
[1:45:54] stop it this has nothing to do with what
[1:45:58] you think with how you feel and with
[1:46:00] what you say the Triumph has already
[1:46:03] been
[1:46:04] accomplished Christ has already defeated
[1:46:08] the works of the
[1:46:09] devil right that's what happened at
[1:46:12] Calvary at the
[1:46:14] Resurrection the the the the work is
[1:46:17] finished the devil is defeated well why
[1:46:20] I have all these troubles and trials
[1:46:22] because he's using you to finish the
[1:46:25] Triumph now think about this if you look
[1:46:29] at
[1:46:30] this you look at this verse he causes us
[1:46:34] to Triumph the word triumph literally
[1:46:36] means a triumphal
[1:46:38] procession so if you if you think about
[1:46:41] this you might see in in in reading
[1:46:43] books or see in the Roman age when the
[1:46:49] military would come in to Rome there
[1:46:51] would be a great assembly of people
[1:46:54] there and the military the general would
[1:46:56] come at the head riding on riding on
[1:46:59] horses and so forth and the military
[1:47:01] would March behind and everyone's
[1:47:04] rejoicing because there has been a
[1:47:05] victory that's already been accomplished
[1:47:08] and so what this is speaking of is a
[1:47:10] victory's already been won a victory's
[1:47:13] already been achieved and we're in the
[1:47:16] company in the army with Christ and
[1:47:18] we're walking behind him and he's
[1:47:20] causing us to walk in
[1:47:23] Triumph that's not a
[1:47:25] question that's not a maybe you always
[1:47:29] are triumphing so can you say I'm
[1:47:31] walking in Triumph do you believe that
[1:47:34] he has won the battle and you're just in
[1:47:36] the procession because he won the battle
[1:47:39] for you your life so then we can go a
[1:47:43] little bit further and extrapolate from
[1:47:45] this that your life is actually meant to
[1:47:49] be a triumphal
[1:47:52] procession in a triumphal procession is
[1:47:54] everybody
[1:47:56] sad is everybody sorro no they're joyful
[1:48:00] why because they know the victory is won
[1:48:02] we're walking forward the enemy might be
[1:48:04] trying to come against us but we're
[1:48:05] walking in Triumph no matter what why
[1:48:08] because Christ has already won the
[1:48:12] victory you don't feel very triumphal
[1:48:15] sometimes right I I I I sense that
[1:48:18] you're saying that I'm saying that
[1:48:20] myself but either way the word says I am
[1:48:24] so do you believe it or not it's a
[1:48:25] matter of
[1:48:28] Faith your life
[1:48:31] then does what if you're walking in that
[1:48:34] triumphal procession of Christ your life
[1:48:37] does what it produces an
[1:48:40] aroma an aroma to do what to make
[1:48:44] manifest his knowledge so what is your
[1:48:47] life your life is actually a manifest
[1:48:50] estation of the knowledge of Jesus
[1:48:53] Christ that is what your life is
[1:48:55] supposed to be expressing so what is
[1:48:58] your life expressing is it expressing
[1:49:01] the Triumph of Christ it should
[1:49:03] be there's nothing that should prevent
[1:49:06] you other than
[1:49:08] you you're the greatest enemy well the
[1:49:10] devil's brought this the devil's brought
[1:49:12] that if you're in Christ the devil has
[1:49:15] no say about it the word declares it
[1:49:18] over
[1:49:19] you the triumphal procession is leading
[1:49:22] us along and we're spreading wherever we
[1:49:25] go the beautiful Aroma of Christ for
[1:49:29] some it speaks of it looks like death to
[1:49:33] them for others it looks like Grace to
[1:49:38] them amen the gospel does not come in
[1:49:41] word only right it's not just us saying
[1:49:45] we believe it but it's in manifestation
[1:49:47] it's in demonstration it's in the power
[1:49:50] of God on display in your life that's
[1:49:54] what making it manifest means it's not
[1:49:58] just well he has a stamp of Christian on
[1:50:00] him he's made his confession no The Life
[1:50:03] of Christ is flowing through him so that
[1:50:06] everyone around knows wow what's that
[1:50:09] smell Something's Cooking around here
[1:50:11] something
[1:50:13] wonderful some wonderful smell well some
[1:50:15] people it's a horrible smell why because
[1:50:17] they're walking and living in death
[1:50:22] it's as the Bible said if our gospel be
[1:50:24] hid it's him hid to them that are lost
[1:50:29] amen 1 Corinthians chapter
[1:50:35] 2 yeah verse
[1:50:38] 3-5 and I was with you in weakness and
[1:50:41] in fear and much trembling and my speech
[1:50:44] and my message were not in plausible
[1:50:46] words of wisdom but in demonstration of
[1:50:49] the spirit and a power so that your
[1:50:51] faith might not rest in the wisdom of
[1:50:54] men but in the power of God Amen that
[1:50:58] that's not just for preachers that's for
[1:51:00] every one of us it's not to come just in
[1:51:04] plausible words you made the best
[1:51:06] argument no it's to come in the power of
[1:51:08] God the power of the Gospel to heal to
[1:51:11] deliver to transform a life that's how
[1:51:14] it's supposed to come and your life is
[1:51:16] to be an expression of
[1:51:18] that uh Second Corinthians chapter
[1:51:22] 4 but have renounced the hidden things
[1:51:24] of dishonesty not walking in craftiness
[1:51:28] nor handling the word of God
[1:51:30] deceitfully but by manifestation of the
[1:51:34] truth commending ourselves to Every
[1:51:36] Man's conscience in the sight of God
[1:51:39] Amen what is our life what is our
[1:51:41] ministry that's for every one of us
[1:51:43] again we put that too much on preachers
[1:51:46] every one of us is ordained to take take
[1:51:50] the word and to be the manifestation of
[1:51:53] the
[1:51:54] truth that's what our ministry is that's
[1:51:56] what we're called to you are to be a
[1:51:58] manifestation of the
[1:52:00] truth by the word not apart from the
[1:52:03] word but by the word that is our Triumph
[1:52:08] in Christ he's called us to hire things
[1:52:12] Saints he's called us to higher Powers
[1:52:14] higher manifestations of the truth
[1:52:16] higher demonstrations of the truth not
[1:52:19] to not to these low things he's called
[1:52:21] us to Great Victory let's walk in it but
[1:52:25] it starts by
[1:52:27] faith starts by believing what God Said
[1:52:30] applies to
[1:52:31] me and then walking forward as though
[1:52:36] that's the truth with what hope not a
[1:52:39] wish hope but an Earnest expectation God
[1:52:42] said so that settles it if someone's
[1:52:45] sick any one of you can go lay hands on
[1:52:48] them and they can be healed we should
[1:52:52] have that understanding we should have
[1:52:53] that mind mindset when we come across a
[1:52:56] person that's sick and Afflicted father
[1:52:58] do you want me to pray for this person
[1:53:00] and then pray and you can with
[1:53:03] expectation believe that they're going
[1:53:04] to be
[1:53:07] healed
[1:53:09] amen the correction that we receive from
[1:53:12] the Lord is to cause us to become
[1:53:16] strong it's not to keep us in a in a low
[1:53:19] place in a weak place we misunderstand
[1:53:21] what it is it's caused us to have the
[1:53:24] strength of the Lord so that we can walk
[1:53:27] in that triumphal procession with Christ
[1:53:30] amen you musicians if you
[1:53:33] come Christ has defeated the enemy and
[1:53:38] we simply March in Triumph with
[1:53:40] him and as we March in Triumph with him
[1:53:43] our lives manifest the truth that we
[1:53:47] have that has been revealed to us amen
[1:53:51] how many of you want to accept Christ's
[1:53:53] Triumph for
[1:53:54] you just move forward with him as though
[1:53:58] you're walking step by step in this
[1:54:01] procession what what is this walk that
[1:54:03] you're walking in it's a walk of Triumph
[1:54:06] a walk of Victory a walk of
[1:54:09] overcoming you say I feel defeated I
[1:54:11] feel this just get up and start walking
[1:54:14] Saints stop listening to the lies of the
[1:54:17] enemy do what you know you're supposed
[1:54:20] to do it's not complicated God has
[1:54:23] brought the word to us he sent a message
[1:54:26] this day it's brought it into such a
[1:54:27] simple way who complicates it the devil
[1:54:31] don't stop listening to him tell him
[1:54:34] he's already a defeated being when
[1:54:36] brother brandham let's all stand when
[1:54:38] brother brandham made the people stand
[1:54:40] and he had them put hands on one another
[1:54:43] what did he say Satan you are a defeated
[1:54:46] enemy you're a defeated
[1:54:48] being he he is defeated
[1:54:54] amen Triumph he's already defeated
[1:54:58] regardless of what you went through what
[1:55:00] regardless of the trial regardless of
[1:55:03] the sin that you've committed repent and
[1:55:06] walk with God he's not telling you to
[1:55:08] wallow in the mud he's telling you to
[1:55:11] walk and be strong get a new grip make
[1:55:14] your knees strong how do you make my
[1:55:17] knees strong take the word and stand
[1:55:19] there
[1:55:20] and believe it confess it and act as
[1:55:23] though it's coming to pass in your life
[1:55:25] because it
[1:55:26] is
[1:55:28] amen no matter what you feel no matter
[1:55:31] how you view yourself throw the way you
[1:55:34] view yourself in the trash can and take
[1:55:38] what God said about you you you can say
[1:55:41] it with me I am a triumphant Christian
[1:55:45] say that with me I am a triumphant
[1:55:48] Christian now say it like you mean it I
[1:55:51] am a triumphant Christian that is what
[1:55:54] God's word says about
[1:55:57] you I want to read
[1:56:01] this before we
[1:56:04] pray there's not one word God has
[1:56:07] promised but what will come to pass he
[1:56:10] said heavens and earth will pass away
[1:56:13] but my word shall not fail every promise
[1:56:17] is
[1:56:18] perfect and on that one promise in
[1:56:20] scripture I will not leave my Holy One
[1:56:23] to see corruption nor suffer him to see
[1:56:25] corruption neither will I leave his soul
[1:56:27] in hell now Jesus knew that corruption
[1:56:29] sets in the body after 72 hours the nose
[1:56:33] falls in Undertaker present would know
[1:56:35] that now the corruption sets in the body
[1:56:37] and David said by the Holy Ghost a man
[1:56:39] inspired the word of the Lord coming to
[1:56:41] this Prophet said I will not suffer my
[1:56:43] Holy One to seek corruption and he
[1:56:45] knowed before one cell would corrupt
[1:56:47] amen he would be up out of the grave
[1:56:50] amen why he was the word fortified by
[1:56:53] the word and he rose up he conquered
[1:56:54] death hell and the grave and himself
[1:56:57] come back in the form of the Holy Ghost
[1:56:59] to fortify his army for this last day
[1:57:03] amen in this big Onslaught where these
[1:57:05] great intellectual Giants rising up
[1:57:07] reasoning against the word but I will
[1:57:10] not leave you comfortless I will come
[1:57:12] again and be with you and in you again
[1:57:15] he said I will pray the father he will
[1:57:17] send you another comforter which is the
[1:57:19] Holy Ghost he will abide with you
[1:57:20] forever what is it the word God's
[1:57:23] artillery in the human being manifesting
[1:57:27] the resurrection think of it that great
[1:57:30] conqueror he's in
[1:57:32] you he's in me he is the great
[1:57:36] conqueror he has brought the word it's
[1:57:38] going to come to
[1:57:40] pass it never
[1:57:43] fails now circumstances come and they're
[1:57:47] try their
[1:57:48] purpose the devil is trying to get you
[1:57:51] to disbelieve the word God is trying to
[1:57:54] bring you to maturity that's the
[1:57:57] confrontation if you're walking in
[1:57:59] Triumph and the conf confrontation comes
[1:58:02] you can simply
[1:58:03] say God's word says this I'm walking in
[1:58:06] that I'm not walking in the doubt that
[1:58:08] the devil's trying to bring me the
[1:58:10] circumstances are ordained of God to
[1:58:13] perfect you they're not ordained to God
[1:58:15] of God to destroy you or to bring you on
[1:58:18] a low level they're ordained to make you
[1:58:21] more like
[1:58:22] Christ and the question is how will you
[1:58:25] respond the devil has a way for you to
[1:58:28] respond and that's to take you low to
[1:58:31] make you weak to make your faith
[1:58:34] inoperable God's not doing that to to
[1:58:37] create that in your life he's trying to
[1:58:39] make you strong so that you can realize
[1:58:41] you can take him as at his word and he
[1:58:43] will do it amen let's
[1:58:46] [Music]
[1:58:48] pray
[1:58:52] father we realize
[1:58:55] that the great sin which separates man
