[31:53] amen god bless you all this morning
[31:55] greet you in the name of the lord
[31:57] happy to be here happy to have all of
[31:59] you here
[32:00] praise the lord we're going to invite
[32:02] you right to the scripture to matthew's
[32:04] gospel
[32:05] the 13th chapter matthew 13.
[32:10] amen praise the lord enjoyed the sunday
[32:13] school lesson
[32:14] uh that brother jd was that part 10 was
[32:16] that the final on that
[32:17] uh yeah okay still got some more on that
[32:20] huh okay we talked about maybe 10 would
[32:22] be it and
[32:23] so you got some more okay the real
[32:25] reason i'm saying that
[32:27] is because that the lesson has been so
[32:29] profound to me
[32:31] i have invited brother jason to take a
[32:34] couple of wednesdays in a row
[32:36] and take all of the parts condense it
[32:39] into two
[32:39] parts because i want the whole church
[32:42] and my fear
[32:43] is that not enough people heard it amen
[32:46] i appreciate all of those who attend the
[32:48] sunday school class
[32:49] and who if you're not attending or
[32:51] streaming and i do get reports that
[32:53] people even are driving to church
[32:54] streaming that's why it's
[32:56] important that we have our audio link
[32:58] working because uh it guarantees a
[32:59] better stream but i thought that it's
[33:02] um it's so relevant so time sensitive
[33:05] what brother jason has been speaking on
[33:07] concerning love
[33:09] that i think it's where we ought to be
[33:12] living
[33:13] i think it's crucial that we be living
[33:16] right there
[33:17] right now i think that we are facing
[33:20] challenges in the world today
[33:22] and you know something friends i
[33:25] appreciate
[33:26] gifts and i appreciate prophecies and
[33:28] dreams and
[33:30] and the lord certainly works in those
[33:32] ways he visits with angels he
[33:35] he does all kinds of things but i i love
[33:37] it when god can show me
[33:39] something in his word because there i
[33:42] have perfect faith
[33:43] if an angel appeared to me and told me
[33:45] something i'd still have to check it by
[33:47] the word
[33:48] amen if i had a vision if i had a dream
[33:50] i'd still have to check it by
[33:52] the word so i'd rather just cut to the
[33:54] chase and lord give me the word
[33:56] amen because there is where my faith is
[33:59] perfect you know
[34:00] the difference between human faith and
[34:02] perfect faith is human faith you have to
[34:04] exercise and try
[34:06] and make it work and work on it and and
[34:08] you have to involve some effort
[34:10] perfect faith isn't has anything to do
[34:11] with you it's god sovereignly coming
[34:13] down
[34:14] and enlightening it to your heart and i
[34:16] have a perfect faith in this book
[34:20] years ago when the lord saved me he gave
[34:22] me a perfect
[34:23] faith in this book and so i i have
[34:27] when i when i can see something in the
[34:29] word
[34:31] there's not enough devils in hell to
[34:32] take me away from it amen
[34:34] praise the lord so i i've asked brother
[34:38] jason to do that you can't do that
[34:39] a lot of times to preachers but teachers
[34:42] you can i've done that in the past
[34:44] i've i remember back in the day when
[34:46] brother lonnie was alive i would
[34:47] periodically call him say bililani
[34:50] i want you to come and teach us on a
[34:51] certain subject i've had other preachers
[34:54] other teachers do the same thing it's a
[34:56] little hard for a preacher to do that
[34:58] but teachers have a special gift that
[35:00] they can take a subject and i just think
[35:03] that
[35:03] that that is so relevant so timely and
[35:06] so powerful
[35:07] that i i just want it even if you've
[35:09] heard if you heard
[35:10] every one of his parts if you were to
[35:11] say i was here uh for every one of them
[35:14] then you're going to really enjoy when
[35:17] he recaps it again
[35:19] at the lord's leading brother jason i'll
[35:21] just leave that in your hands
[35:22] amen but i sure would like to have that
[35:25] praise the lord
[35:26] enjoyed all of that singing wow that
[35:29] song says to meredith
[35:30] goodness that's so i would be
[35:32] hard-pressed to describe how that
[35:33] blessed me
[35:34] amen and brother god bless you i so
[35:36] enjoyed your family what a beautiful
[35:37] family singing
[35:38] god bless you welcome you here today i
[35:40] don't recognize you do i do i haven't
[35:42] met you before what's your name
[35:46] brother simmons pray praise the lord
[35:49] brother
[35:49] that's maybe where i remember because
[35:51] you look familiar to me
[35:53] but um amen i enjoyed that that is
[35:55] wonderful amen i love to see
[35:58] families you know praying together
[36:00] singing together in church together
[36:02] amen there's something so divinely
[36:04] beautiful about that
[36:06] praise the lord all right matthew
[36:08] chapter 13
[36:10] we want to just read these first nine
[36:12] verses and we'll let you be seated
[36:14] amen uh
[36:17] okay i might have to cater corner that a
[36:20] little bit so everybody can see it a
[36:21] little better
[36:22] um that looks like a deep subject don't
[36:24] it
[36:26] amen we're going to talk about the
[36:27] circle of life
[36:29] actually i'm going to preach today on
[36:31] living between two realities
[36:33] amen matthew chapter 13 verse 1.
[36:38] the same day went jesus out of the house
[36:40] and sat by the seaside
[36:42] and great multitudes were gathered
[36:44] together unto him
[36:46] so that he went into a ship and sat
[36:50] and the whole multitude stood on the
[36:52] shore and he spake many things unto them
[36:54] in parables
[36:56] saying behold a sower went forth to sow
[37:00] and when he sowed some seeds fell by the
[37:02] wayside
[37:03] the fowls came and devoured them up some
[37:06] fell
[37:07] upon stony places where they had not
[37:10] much earth and forthwith they sprung up
[37:13] because they had no deepness of earth
[37:16] and when the sun was
[37:17] up they were scorched
[37:21] they were scorched and because they had
[37:23] no root they
[37:24] withered away and some fell among thorns
[37:28] and the thorns sprung up and choked them
[37:31] but other
[37:31] fell into good ground and brought forth
[37:34] fruit some a hundred fold
[37:36] some sixty-fold and some thirty-fold
[37:40] who hath ears to hear let him hear
[37:44] amen we want to go to prayer this
[37:46] morning
[37:47] and we're gonna ask the lord's blessing
[37:50] upon speaker and hearer
[37:51] the word is already blessed but we need
[37:54] his anointing today
[37:55] amen so um you pray for me
[37:59] i'm a little bit uh was iffy whether i
[38:01] would be able to carry today brother jd
[38:03] was ready
[38:04] in the bullpen to take it uh i a couple
[38:07] of years ago i
[38:08] fell on the ice injured both shoulders
[38:11] got through that they were healed up
[38:12] nicely
[38:14] and a couple of months ago i
[38:16] re-aggravated the left shoulder well
[38:18] through various therapies and everything
[38:21] you know whenever pain starts moving
[38:22] that's generally a sign
[38:24] of healing and so uh it moved all right
[38:27] and it's moved
[38:28] up into my neck and so i'm having a lot
[38:31] of
[38:32] cramping like charlie horse in your neck
[38:34] if you can imagine that
[38:35] and it's been quite excruciating doc
[38:38] meredith has taken good care of me so
[38:39] don't worry
[38:40] i'm fine i've got some meds for it we're
[38:42] trusting the lord
[38:44] to get me through it amen so if i seem
[38:47] to be moving a little slow today that's
[38:48] on purpose
[38:50] amen um also we want to pray for brother
[38:54] blue
[38:54] sister sarah passed away early this
[38:56] morning so
[38:57] she of course sister sarah wonderful
[39:00] christian
[39:01] she's been in declining health for years
[39:04] we were praying she's been in the
[39:05] hospital over in charleston
[39:07] and she went home to be with the lord so
[39:10] asleep to us
[39:11] but awake to god but you know that's
[39:15] still a terrible loss so
[39:16] let's pray for brother blue for the
[39:18] children for the whole
[39:20] assembly um and that the lord will just
[39:23] bring the comfort that he promised
[39:25] he promised amen he's good at keeping
[39:28] his promises
[39:29] amen let's pray father we thank you
[39:32] this morning for your word thank you for
[39:36] these divinely revealed truths that come
[39:38] to us in this hour
[39:40] we're have great confidence in your word
[39:42] lord
[39:43] and i know that it is accomplishing even
[39:46] more
[39:46] than we can think or ask certainly more
[39:49] than we're aware of
[39:50] and so it is with that confidence that i
[39:53] approach the word today
[39:54] to give us a time where we can look into
[39:57] a fold of your word
[39:59] things you've inspired my heart i pray
[40:02] now lord that you will
[40:03] anoint the speaker and the hearer today
[40:06] we know your word is already anointed
[40:09] i pray lord that you'll be with me
[40:11] father and let your anointing be upon me
[40:13] once that happens it
[40:15] there's there's no pain at all can break
[40:18] through that
[40:18] so i'm looking for that father and i'm
[40:20] committing it to you
[40:21] now lord a sadness in our heart
[40:26] to think of brother blue lord our dear
[40:29] friend and the assembly there and the
[40:31] whole family
[40:32] and you and your sovereign divine
[40:35] wisdom have elected lord to carry sister
[40:39] sarah on home to her reward now it's a
[40:42] happy day for her
[40:44] but going to be sad for us and for the
[40:45] family so i pray master that you'll be a
[40:48] great comfort you promised you would
[40:50] and we know you keep your promises so
[40:53] i'm committing it now into your hands
[40:57] and may you bless us the remainder of
[40:58] this day in jesus name amen god bless
[41:02] you
[41:02] you can be seated
[41:18] amen
[41:24] praise the lord i think i'll start here
[41:26] now
[41:27] let me kind of caddy corner this if i
[41:30] can
[41:31] and that way everybody can get a fairly
[41:34] decent
[41:34] view of it amen y'all should be you see
[41:37] that good brother don
[41:38] good enough amen joy good enough okay
[41:41] praise the lord looks like a very simple
[41:43] concept
[41:45] but we're going to be uh speaking today
[41:50] on living between two realities
[41:54] now this of course is john 1. if you put
[41:56] that up
[41:57] brother josh john 1 and 1 up
[42:00] on the screen and just be ready to go
[42:03] back to matthew because we're really
[42:04] going to use the
[42:05] you're going to get a workout today
[42:06] brother josh praise the lord
[42:08] amen so jo uh
[42:11] saint john chapter 1 verse 1 of course
[42:14] in the beginning
[42:15] we realized that this is the beginning
[42:17] before the beginning in genesis
[42:20] amen genesis starts out with you know
[42:23] god creating the heavens and the earth
[42:25] but this beginning predates that
[42:28] in the beginning was the word and the
[42:31] word was with god and the word was god
[42:33] so this is the logos this is the form
[42:36] that god took as the pillar of fire
[42:39] and that was brother branham called that
[42:41] the first son of god
[42:43] now not a son like we would necessarily
[42:46] think in the english term
[42:47] because i have sons who are separate
[42:51] from me as a separate person this is not
[42:55] the the logos was not a separate person
[42:58] from god
[42:59] in that sense that in this case sonship
[43:02] is more of a title
[43:03] that he's now taking this is why brother
[43:06] branham would say there's no such thing
[43:07] as an eternal son
[43:09] because a son is a son comes from
[43:12] something
[43:13] so uh so god simply moves
[43:16] from that self-existing spirit that no
[43:20] man hath seen or can see
[43:22] he dwelt in in in light and this was
[43:25] before angels this was before
[43:28] stars this was before planets this was
[43:31] before there was anything brother
[43:32] branham
[43:33] even uses an astonishing um
[43:36] way to describe it he says that this was
[43:39] a
[43:40] time when god was not even exactly god
[43:42] now he wasn't denying that god was that
[43:44] eternal elohim
[43:46] that he was that great divine fountain
[43:48] back in eternities
[43:49] all he's simply meaning was that there
[43:52] was nothing to worship this being
[43:54] and so god in english means object of
[43:58] worship
[43:59] since there was nothing to worship him
[44:01] that english word god doesn't apply
[44:04] to to this until he creates angels
[44:08] and angels start worshiping now it's
[44:11] important that you realize
[44:13] that in this office the word he was the
[44:15] word the logos
[44:17] this is the first son of god because now
[44:19] brother branham says it like this
[44:21] he says i can see that little light
[44:23] starting to form
[44:25] something that could be seen
[44:27] interestingly enough
[44:28] at the time he did that there's no one
[44:30] to see it
[44:32] so if a tree falls in a forest and
[44:34] there's no one there to hear it does
[44:36] it actually make a sound all right we're
[44:37] not gonna get too deep into that today
[44:40] but at the time when he he's actually
[44:43] can be seen there's not yet anything to
[44:44] see
[44:45] and so he starts creating angels and
[44:47] they start worshiping him
[44:48] now he's he's moving into a
[44:51] manifestation
[44:52] now he's being worshiped so now he he
[44:55] was always that same being but now
[44:58] he's god see and so
[45:01] then when he then he moves that form
[45:04] into that pillar of fire and because he
[45:07] went from here to there
[45:09] and and so now there's an expression so
[45:12] that
[45:12] takes a designation son
[45:15] all right not like this father and this
[45:18] son
[45:18] this is a different human that was the
[45:21] same person only taking a different form
[45:23] he condescended
[45:24] you got it that's that's rudimentary to
[45:27] us and so
[45:28] we realized that it was in that form
[45:31] that he created heavens and earth
[45:35] according to john 1 according to
[45:36] ephesians the third chapter
[45:38] every there's not anything that was made
[45:40] that was not made
[45:42] by the word amen amen and the bible says
[45:46] in ephesians 3
[45:47] all things were made by jesus christ see
[45:50] and yet genesis 1 1 says in the
[45:52] beginning god created
[45:54] so either the bible is lying the bible
[45:56] is the writers were confused
[45:58] or it's all the same person take your
[46:01] choice
[46:02] but for me i'm i'm i don't i don't have
[46:05] enough faith to believe if you believe
[46:07] he was
[46:08] three two or three different people then
[46:10] you got more faith than me
[46:11] because i can't read that in the
[46:12] scriptures amen
[46:14] so we realize that why did i draw it as
[46:17] a circle because a circle
[46:19] represents eternity so god never had a
[46:23] time that he started don't blow fuses
[46:25] trying to comprehend that
[46:27] he never had a time that he started and
[46:29] so
[46:30] to god there's no forwards or backwards
[46:33] in time to us it's linear
[46:34] to him it's not you understand even the
[46:37] uh brother jd what was that fancy word
[46:40] you used about god using language that
[46:41] we can understand
[46:44] what he said amen anthropomorphic
[46:48] amen that's what you get when you go to
[46:50] college you get all these words
[46:54] and so because god has to use those
[46:56] words
[46:57] because how are you going to describe a
[46:59] being like this
[47:01] you know even even solomon was
[47:03] bewildered how to build a temple he said
[47:05] who am i how am i going to build a
[47:07] temple that's going to house god
[47:09] when heaven is his throne and the earth
[47:12] is just a footstool
[47:13] i mean how you know who am i to think
[47:15] that god could be
[47:17] you know dwell in a house and so
[47:20] we realized that and i'm not trying to
[47:23] teach on the godhead today i'm trying to
[47:24] set a foundation for you
[47:26] to to give you to understand so this is
[47:29] why
[47:30] this is the realm god lives in all right
[47:33] now we find that that's why
[47:38] a child of god who is born again
[47:42] of the holy ghost can never backslide
[47:46] amen amen meaning
[47:50] lose your new birth now you very
[47:53] well could make a mistake thank god
[47:57] good news don't don't pass out good news
[47:59] the blood of jesus christ
[48:01] is already atoning for the mistake
[48:03] before you make it
[48:06] you understand it's already atoning it's
[48:08] already speaking
[48:10] brother brother branham said he doesn't
[48:11] even he doesn't even in one place he
[48:13] said
[48:14] he doesn't see you he sees your
[48:15] sacrifice he doesn't even hear your
[48:17] voice
[48:17] he hears when you are repenting this is
[48:20] what brother branham taught us when
[48:21] you're repenting
[48:23] from a broken heart by the holy ghost
[48:26] that's
[48:26] christ interceding using your voice and
[48:29] god hears the voice of christ
[48:31] that beautiful see when you when it's
[48:35] really coming from your heart
[48:36] and brother branham said you know the
[48:39] the blood speaks for me
[48:41] how can he condemn me when the blood is
[48:43] perpetually speaking for me
[48:45] so we know that we can make mistakes yes
[48:49] you can your prayer life can get slack
[48:51] your church attendance can get slack
[48:53] your fellowship can get slack you can
[48:55] get cold
[48:56] little carnal
[49:00] there's no more miserable a person than
[49:02] a christian carnal around the edges
[49:06] that's a horrible life don't live there
[49:08] friends it's not fun
[49:10] and so we're meant to be eagles we're
[49:12] meant to be soaring we're meant to be
[49:14] overcomers that's the promise why would
[49:17] you
[49:17] why would you not take advantage of the
[49:19] promise
[49:20] live above it amen and and you and
[49:23] and peter said that you can actually get
[49:25] to the point where you never fall
[49:27] brother branham used his words to
[49:29] describe it he said you go so far into
[49:31] christ satan can't find you
[49:32] wouldn't that be amazing so
[49:35] we realized that the reason that that uh
[49:39] that a born-again child of god can never
[49:42] fall
[49:42] out of that is because in your soul
[49:46] when you're born again of the spirit of
[49:48] god when that gene of god has come to
[49:50] life that is the new birth
[49:51] amen amen the gene of god come to life
[49:55] then then that soul has already passed
[49:58] from death to life
[50:00] it can never enter into the judgment it
[50:01] can never be indicted
[50:03] you can never be accused no god will not
[50:06] accept an accusation against a
[50:07] born-again child
[50:09] it doesn't matter how much video replay
[50:11] satan has it's all dismissed
[50:14] no there is now therefore no
[50:16] condemnation to them which are in christ
[50:17] jesus why
[50:19] because your soul is already in heavenly
[50:22] places with christ jesus
[50:24] brother branham said you're already on
[50:26] the other side of the chasm worshiping
[50:28] sitting with christ
[50:29] hallelujah see and what we're doing now
[50:33] is is that so now you're already
[50:36] living between two realities
[50:40] when you're born again you're living in
[50:42] two worlds
[50:44] because this guy is still here amen
[50:47] and now that that inner that inner life
[50:50] of christ
[50:51] is on the inside but it's already in
[50:53] that realm you've already got a gateway
[50:55] opened hallelujah that's why
[50:59] you can come boldly into the throne room
[51:01] of god
[51:02] the gateway is open to you you
[51:05] understand
[51:06] so so we find that that here
[51:10] there's no forwards there's no backwards
[51:13] there's no yesterday there's no tomorrow
[51:15] it's all right now
[51:16] so you can't backslide
[51:20] because in here there is no back
[51:25] so you can't backslide there is no back
[51:28] you're already in eternity amen
[51:32] so we realize then that what are we what
[51:34] is the
[51:35] what is the holy ghost the holy ghost is
[51:37] the spirit of adoption
[51:39] growing you perfecting you bringing you
[51:41] to a body change
[51:43] so that this guy matches all three
[51:46] layers of you
[51:46] sync up and live in this realm
[51:50] right now you're forced to live in two
[51:53] realities
[51:55] you're living between two worlds see
[51:58] you can be influenced by either one
[52:02] all right now brother branham did an
[52:05] interesting thing when he drew this
[52:08] he drew a little loop he called it a
[52:11] loop a little loop down
[52:13] he said his wife called it a hickey so
[52:15] you know it
[52:16] in my mind i wasn't there to see it but
[52:18] i imagine just a little loop i'm gonna
[52:21] i'm gonna kind of draw it up maybe a
[52:25] little different than what he described
[52:27] only because i want to emphasize a point
[52:29] he didn't emphasize
[52:30] until later he later he emphasized it
[52:32] but not at the time when he made the
[52:34] drawing
[52:35] so what i'm going to do is i'm going to
[52:38] draw
[52:38] your life like this brother branham said
[52:43] that what we have is
[52:46] a little drop down or a little loop down
[52:50] and what happens is and i drew it in red
[52:53] because this is the time of redemption
[52:56] when god's family comes out of this
[52:58] realm and drops down and lives in this
[53:00] realm
[53:01] and you're in time and you're born in
[53:04] sin
[53:04] and you and the but the blood of jesus
[53:06] christ is there for you
[53:08] a gene of god is already inside you amen
[53:12] all right you're still with me so this
[53:15] is the time
[53:16] of our lives now you you've got that all
[53:20] right
[53:20] now let let me let me make
[53:23] a couple of points
[53:27] all right
[53:31] 2020 presidential election is in here
[53:36] thank god it's not in here
[53:41] now bear in mind and here's the point i
[53:42] want to make that brother branham didn't
[53:44] make till later
[53:45] notice that the timelines are running
[53:47] together
[53:49] so you've got two realities that are
[53:51] still running this is still in operation
[53:52] just because the
[53:53] just because satan didn't sucker-punch
[53:56] god in genesis
[53:58] you understand eternity's still
[54:02] in business sister blue has already left
[54:06] this line and went to this line
[54:10] god amen amen sister seal has left this
[54:14] one she went to this one
[54:16] hallelujah this is why we say she's
[54:18] asleep to us because her body's buried
[54:20] down here
[54:21] but she's awake to god because her soul
[54:24] is there
[54:25] and she's already got a word body
[54:29] wow i'm not supposed to get excited
[54:32] today
[54:35] so we find that that you know
[54:38] all the chaos is down here all the
[54:42] burning cities
[54:43] are down here coveted 19 is down here
[54:47] don't worry it's not up here
[54:51] hallelujah so there's no election
[54:55] chaos in that circle there's no racial
[54:58] injustice up here
[55:00] that's all down here amen there's no
[55:02] women
[55:03] treated like doormats there's no child
[55:05] abuse
[55:06] there's no poverty there's no viruses
[55:09] there's no sickness
[55:10] there's no funerals hallelujah
[55:14] up here that's all down here
[55:18] in this little loop of time
[55:21] this round this realm has registries of
[55:25] life they keep them birth records they
[55:27] do census and count the people and and
[55:30] they have they build cemeteries and put
[55:32] people's names who used to live
[55:34] this this realm is filled with registry
[55:37] of former citizens and current citizens
[55:40] i'm here to tell you this realm also has
[55:42] a citizen registry
[55:45] and what you want to rejoice in today
[55:48] because you see
[55:49] the word for your hour which came from
[55:51] this realm it's not a creation of this
[55:53] realm
[55:54] this is where the reformers had to deal
[55:55] with but this
[55:57] but the message we have is what paul had
[55:59] and that came
[56:00] paul said i didn't get it from men i got
[56:03] it from this realm
[56:05] amen and because you see that that is an
[56:09] identification with you
[56:11] that this is your origin not this
[56:15] i'm here to tell you no matter how bad
[56:17] your life has been
[56:18] here or might be tomorrow here
[56:21] it don't matter because you got a life
[56:24] here coming
[56:26] your future is bright your future
[56:29] is secure i'm living between two
[56:32] realities right now
[56:33] but but well i'm going to tell you
[56:35] something friends what you want to do as
[56:37] a christian is
[56:38] lose this one and start living according
[56:41] to this one
[56:43] amen now
[56:47] all right watch let me carry on
[56:53] all right brother um
[56:57] josh let's go
[57:00] to we've already read down to verse 9
[57:02] let's pick up to verse 10.
[57:04] we read verse 9 in john 1
[57:08] i'm sorry i'm sorry josh in matthew 13
[57:12] and we read one through nine so let's
[57:13] pick up matthew 13
[57:16] verse verse 10 and verse 9 was who hath
[57:19] ears to hear
[57:20] let him hear all right verse 10 and the
[57:24] disciples
[57:24] came and said unto him why
[57:28] speakest thou unto them in parables
[57:34] so there's a reason for it
[57:37] amen god didn't jesus wasn't doing it
[57:40] there's nothing in the word
[57:42] that is redundant or pointless
[57:46] every word even every punctuation
[57:50] every iota every jot every tittle
[57:53] is important and for a reason
[57:56] see that's why brother branham said you
[57:58] should be able to see jesus christ
[58:00] in every verse and every line
[58:04] see and and i and i get sometimes people
[58:07] struggle with that because they read
[58:08] heinous acts
[58:10] of of of of stories in the bible and
[58:13] they read terrible things of genocide
[58:15] and
[58:16] and horrible acts of perversion and
[58:18] idolatry and say my goodness
[58:20] how is how is jesus in those verses
[58:23] because he never did any of those things
[58:25] that's right
[58:26] he didn't but you did and he took your
[58:29] guilt
[58:30] and gave you his innocence no matter
[58:32] what you read in here you
[58:34] should be able to read jesus christ in
[58:36] every line
[58:37] next time you read some heinous sin and
[58:39] you know in your mind
[58:41] that you are guilty of that just say
[58:43] thank god for jesus christ
[58:45] because i'm not guilty of that anymore
[58:48] he
[58:48] took that sin amen he took it
[58:51] literally brother branham god traded the
[58:55] innocent for the guilty gave up
[58:58] jesus to get you amen
[59:02] amen can you absorb that gave up the
[59:05] innocent
[59:06] jesus to get you and brother branham
[59:10] said and we're not just talking about
[59:11] metaphorically brother
[59:12] it was so valid a swap
[59:16] that he died for it and
[59:20] god even let it happen and left him at
[59:22] calvary
[59:23] and brother branham said god judged him
[59:25] a sinner who knew no sin who had never
[59:28] committed a sin
[59:29] but he became sin for you and i and
[59:31] brother brown says god
[59:32] judged him as a sinner and sent him to
[59:35] hell
[59:37] you know why so you you
[59:41] you you you you you
[59:44] you and me would never have to go there
[59:50] see how could a hell could hold you but
[59:52] it couldn't hold him
[59:54] the grave couldn't hold him so he says
[59:58] and he answered verse 11 he answered and
[1:00:01] said unto them
[1:00:02] here's why why do i speak in parables
[1:00:05] because it is given unto you
[1:00:08] to know the mysteries of the circle amen
[1:00:13] amen all right it is given unto you to
[1:00:17] know the mysteries of the kingdom of
[1:00:18] heaven
[1:00:19] but to them in the alternate reality
[1:00:23] it's not given to them
[1:00:27] so there's the first principle jesus
[1:00:29] speaks to
[1:00:30] everybody that claims the name of jesus
[1:00:34] remember in the church ages
[1:00:36] because the false church said they
[1:00:38] called themselves ecclesia
[1:00:40] and so because they claimed the name of
[1:00:43] jesus
[1:00:44] then he spoke to them and gave and and
[1:00:47] and
[1:00:47] they and now the requirements of that
[1:00:49] church were upon them
[1:00:50] and so they they didn't do theirselves a
[1:00:52] very good service by making that claim
[1:00:55] so the first point we want to make is
[1:00:57] that he speaks to everybody
[1:00:59] who claims the name of jesus but he
[1:01:01] speaks in parables
[1:01:04] to the non-elect amen
[1:01:07] amen he he gives a legitimate
[1:01:11] non-facetious totally legit opportunity
[1:01:14] for every man to save himself from
[1:01:15] destruction he's not an unjust god
[1:01:18] he provides a way jesus died at calvary
[1:01:20] for the sins of the whole world
[1:01:22] amen and anybody whosoever will can
[1:01:25] believe that
[1:01:26] i i you know people who argue against
[1:01:29] against election by they wouldn't argue
[1:01:32] against it if they understood its origin
[1:01:35] i mean it's not it's not a lottery it's
[1:01:38] not bias or prejudice
[1:01:40] this young man is my son by origin
[1:01:45] none of you other ones are that's not
[1:01:47] unfair to you
[1:01:49] it just is it just is
[1:01:52] it's not a question of fairness and so
[1:01:56] you know if if i said you know if i've
[1:01:59] got
[1:02:00] you know enough money to give my son the
[1:02:03] inheritance of my kingdom
[1:02:04] and because all of y'all love me too
[1:02:08] then i'm going to give all of y'all a
[1:02:09] place over there and give all y'all some
[1:02:11] millions in a mansion also
[1:02:13] he'll still be he'll still be royal
[1:02:16] family you understand
[1:02:17] so god's god doesn't want anybody to die
[1:02:22] he pleads with humanity why will you die
[1:02:24] why would you not come to me that you
[1:02:26] may have life
[1:02:28] so you're going to find out that people
[1:02:30] make choices
[1:02:32] and it's not god's fault and it's not my
[1:02:35] fault
[1:02:35] and it's not your fault all right
[1:02:39] the the bottom line is he speaks
[1:02:43] to all who claim his name but to
[1:02:46] non-elect he speaks in parables but to
[1:02:49] the elect
[1:02:50] he gives us understanding um
[1:02:53] hey josh can you get luke 10 21 real
[1:02:56] fast
[1:02:57] amen luke 10 21 in that hour jesus
[1:03:02] rejoiced in the spirit
[1:03:04] and said i thank thee o father
[1:03:07] lord of heaven and earth that thou has
[1:03:10] hid these things
[1:03:11] from the wise and prudent and has
[1:03:14] revealed them
[1:03:15] unto babes even so father
[1:03:18] for it seemed good in thy sight all
[1:03:21] right
[1:03:22] so that's the nature of jesus all
[1:03:25] through the ages
[1:03:27] you'll find him operating that way he
[1:03:29] operated that way all the way back to
[1:03:30] the book of genesis
[1:03:32] he speaks things on in an unclear way
[1:03:36] because you got a seat belt on
[1:03:39] because not everybody is supposed to
[1:03:41] catch it
[1:03:44] now i'm not out of the bible i'm only
[1:03:47] telling you
[1:03:48] they asked him why do you do that and he
[1:03:50] gave him the answer because to you it's
[1:03:51] given to them it's not given
[1:03:52] see all right now watch
[1:03:56] so so then matthew back to matthew 13.
[1:04:01] all right matthew 13 all right i think
[1:04:04] verse 14 for whosoever hath
[1:04:08] to him shall be given and he shall have
[1:04:11] more abundance
[1:04:13] but whosoever hath not from him shall be
[1:04:17] taken away
[1:04:18] even that he hath i think that was verse
[1:04:20] 12 brother josh my
[1:04:21] my apologies now to verse 13. therefore
[1:04:25] speak i to them in parables because
[1:04:29] they seeing see not and
[1:04:32] hearing they hear not neither do they
[1:04:35] understand
[1:04:36] and in them is fulfilled the prophecy of
[1:04:40] esias which saith hearing
[1:04:43] ye shall hear and shall not understand
[1:04:45] and seeing ye shall see
[1:04:46] and shall not perceive for this people's
[1:04:49] heart is wax gross
[1:04:50] and their ears are dull of hearing and
[1:04:53] their
[1:04:54] eyes read it with me they
[1:04:57] have closed all right so now here comes
[1:05:01] his answer
[1:05:02] lest at any time they should see with
[1:05:05] their eyes
[1:05:06] and hear with their ears and should
[1:05:08] understand with their heart
[1:05:10] and should be converted and i should
[1:05:13] heal them
[1:05:14] so if they can hear from their heart and
[1:05:17] understand then conversion is there
[1:05:20] you understand so that's why brother
[1:05:23] branham said
[1:05:25] what is the new birth it's a revelation
[1:05:29] of jesus christ personally to you
[1:05:34] all right so whenever the heart can hear
[1:05:38] and understand the conversion is there
[1:05:41] and healing is there
[1:05:43] so with understanding comes all
[1:05:47] the blessings of the word of god so
[1:05:49] therefore
[1:05:50] god hid it from some for the purpose
[1:05:54] that they're not all going to receive it
[1:05:58] amen all right
[1:06:01] now watch all right matthew
[1:06:04] we read there in in uh verse 14 because
[1:06:07] of the prophecy of
[1:06:08] isaiah isis isaiah of course isaiah had
[1:06:12] laid out
[1:06:13] that when christ came isaiah prophesied
[1:06:16] this 700 years before it happened
[1:06:19] he prophesied that when christ come
[1:06:22] israel
[1:06:23] would be too blind to receive him
[1:06:27] so why is jesus speaking in parables
[1:06:31] he's
[1:06:32] helping bring to pass isaiah's words
[1:06:37] you got me in other words he's on the
[1:06:40] he's used he's
[1:06:42] his life is working out of the same
[1:06:43] playbook that was written in the circle
[1:06:47] amen there's a book of life of the lamb
[1:06:51] slain before the foundation of the world
[1:06:53] that took place in the circle not in the
[1:06:55] loop down
[1:06:56] amen the loop down only was a
[1:06:59] manifestation
[1:07:00] of what had already been planned in the
[1:07:01] circle all right in the eternities
[1:07:05] and so we find then that he's that
[1:07:07] isaiah
[1:07:08] speaks under inspiration of god that
[1:07:11] when the messiah comes on on the
[1:07:14] scene israel will be too blind to catch
[1:07:16] it now
[1:07:18] all you have to do is go in your mind
[1:07:22] to revelation 3 17 josh revelation 3 17.
[1:07:26] all right you're going to see the exact
[1:07:28] same principle all right
[1:07:31] revelation 3 17 this is our age
[1:07:34] amen this is the age of the church
[1:07:38] of the last day because thou sayest i am
[1:07:41] rich
[1:07:42] and increased with goods and have need
[1:07:44] of nothing
[1:07:45] and knowest not that thou art wretched
[1:07:48] and miserable and poor and blind and
[1:07:50] naked now
[1:07:51] if you think isaiah's feat was amazing
[1:07:55] that he could write
[1:07:56] something 700 years before it happened
[1:07:59] imagine this is written 2 000 years
[1:08:02] before it happened
[1:08:03] and yet we look around the world and we
[1:08:06] look at man-made church systems and we
[1:08:09] we read revelation 3 17 and go yep
[1:08:13] boy he hit that one on the money see
[1:08:16] because
[1:08:16] god has already spoken
[1:08:20] the condition of the end time and so
[1:08:23] he he already has spoken that the end
[1:08:26] time
[1:08:26] church would be blind and miserable and
[1:08:29] naked
[1:08:30] and wretched and that they would put him
[1:08:32] out
[1:08:33] amen and they did and they are
[1:08:37] amen so we find that that now
[1:08:40] now romans if you i'm not going to do it
[1:08:42] today but if you want to go home for a
[1:08:44] good follow-up study to today's lesson
[1:08:47] go home and read the 10th and the 11th
[1:08:49] chapter
[1:08:50] of the book of romans because you're
[1:08:52] going to find that paul
[1:08:53] separates the elected from the blinded
[1:08:57] from the self-damned
[1:09:01] three categories of people romans
[1:09:04] 10 deals with the self-damned
[1:09:07] who closed their own eyes out of
[1:09:10] rebellion if you
[1:09:12] if you go and you and you look at some
[1:09:14] of those principles in
[1:09:15] romans 10 you're going to find
[1:09:17] constantly
[1:09:18] that paul talks about what happened to
[1:09:20] those jews back there under moses they
[1:09:23] were rebellious
[1:09:24] and they didn't want to believe the word
[1:09:27] of god
[1:09:28] and when jesus came on the scene
[1:09:32] and we find that paul is trying to show
[1:09:34] how that
[1:09:35] the true israel's not lost he's trying
[1:09:37] to get it across to the gentile churches
[1:09:39] to say
[1:09:40] you're elect he's taught them you're
[1:09:42] electing christ before the foundation of
[1:09:43] the world
[1:09:44] but don't discount true israel because
[1:09:46] they're elected also
[1:09:48] but they were and he deals with this in
[1:09:50] romans 11
[1:09:51] they were blinded so you could come in
[1:09:54] but we find them in the fifth seal that
[1:09:57] all
[1:09:57] through the seven church ages all seven
[1:10:00] contiguous
[1:10:01] and continuous ages that they were
[1:10:04] given white robes not because of the
[1:10:07] testimony of jesus christ they weren't
[1:10:08] they didn't have that
[1:10:09] but they were given white robes for the
[1:10:11] testimony they held
[1:10:14] amen so paul in romans 10
[1:10:17] deals with those jesus met them
[1:10:21] and i think in john chapter 8 when they
[1:10:23] challenged him on their genealogy
[1:10:26] and they had i mean you think you think
[1:10:29] you can do a dna swab today
[1:10:31] and get a genealogy these guys had
[1:10:33] family records that went all the way
[1:10:35] back to abraham
[1:10:36] and could prove and when they said we
[1:10:38] were abraham's children jesus didn't
[1:10:40] even argue that in fact as he agreed
[1:10:41] he said i know you're abraham's children
[1:10:43] but you tried to kill me and abraham
[1:10:45] didn't do that
[1:10:46] so i get that your your lineage is back
[1:10:48] there
[1:10:49] and now paul is in romans 10 explaining
[1:10:51] to the church
[1:10:52] listen you got to face the facts that
[1:10:54] not only you know there's
[1:10:56] israelites that just did not want to
[1:10:58] follow god
[1:10:59] just like there's christians today the
[1:11:01] bible says not all israel's israel he
[1:11:03] would say in another place
[1:11:04] just like not all christians are
[1:11:05] christians what determines
[1:11:07] what determines a true israelite what
[1:11:09] determines it with 144 000
[1:11:11] it's those who believe the word of their
[1:11:13] hour what determines it for a real
[1:11:15] christian those who believe the word of
[1:11:16] their hour
[1:11:17] why how does that work because that's
[1:11:19] how they get a new birth
[1:11:23] and it's evidence when you have passed
[1:11:25] from death into life
[1:11:26] by the word of your hour you're already
[1:11:29] living
[1:11:30] in in this realm yes but in that realm
[1:11:32] also amen
[1:11:35] and so so paul separates very clearly
[1:11:39] this is done paul does this on purpose
[1:11:42] to clear god of any impropriety or
[1:11:45] double dealing
[1:11:46] or injustice you cannot when you go read
[1:11:49] romans 10 and 11
[1:11:50] there's no way to come away blaming god
[1:11:53] impossible not if you read the bible
[1:11:55] because he talks about how that they
[1:11:57] made these choices of their own
[1:12:00] volition they that god didn't force them
[1:12:02] to do it it wasn't a setup it wasn't a
[1:12:04] sting it wasn't entrapment
[1:12:06] god gave them a legitimate chance they
[1:12:08] wouldn't take it
[1:12:09] they didn't want it
[1:12:13] all right we're going to show you some
[1:12:14] more of that in the modern day all right
[1:12:16] so
[1:12:16] so this is the principle so what is paul
[1:12:20] talking about in the old testament
[1:12:23] you're seeing the principle
[1:12:25] you're seeing the old testament version
[1:12:27] of strong delusion
[1:12:30] we have a new testament application of
[1:12:33] that
[1:12:33] that was prophesied that when people
[1:12:36] make a choice
[1:12:37] remember paul said the talking about the
[1:12:38] ancient people that when they knew god
[1:12:41] they actually knew him they actually
[1:12:42] knew who he was and they knew what was
[1:12:43] the truth
[1:12:44] they on purpose chose not to worship him
[1:12:46] as god
[1:12:47] remember that made of him four-footed
[1:12:49] creatures and winged creatures and
[1:12:51] reptiles and birds they did that god
[1:12:52] didn't trick him into doing that they
[1:12:54] wanted to do that
[1:12:55] they didn't want i say it all time
[1:12:57] people don't want a real
[1:12:58] they'd rather have a denomination
[1:13:01] because a denomination is just a
[1:13:03] you know a guideline of how you live and
[1:13:04] what we do and when we come to church
[1:13:06] and what we do
[1:13:06] but but a christianity is a living
[1:13:09] experience
[1:13:10] and people don't want a living god
[1:13:12] because then they're responsible
[1:13:14] that's why they built idols because they
[1:13:16] didn't want to acknowledge that god was
[1:13:18] real and alive
[1:13:19] because when you acknowledge as soon as
[1:13:21] you acknowledge that then you
[1:13:22] you acknowledge an obligation to that
[1:13:24] god and that's what they didn't want to
[1:13:27] do they didn't want to have that
[1:13:28] they wanted to be able to make their own
[1:13:30] choices see
[1:13:32] and so we find then that you see it all
[1:13:35] the way back the spirit of adultery i'm
[1:13:38] sorry the spirit
[1:13:39] of idolatry uh self-determination
[1:13:42] uh oh that was on operated in israel
[1:13:44] even back through the old testament you
[1:13:46] see it all the way back to cain
[1:13:49] you see it all the way back to cain now
[1:13:51] i'll just give you a fair warning today
[1:13:52] there's some i looked across my notes to
[1:13:54] the finish and i realized
[1:13:56] some of the things i'm going to say
[1:13:57] might be a repeating from a previous
[1:13:59] sermon
[1:14:00] but i'm anointed of the holy spirit to
[1:14:02] repeat them again
[1:14:03] and expand on them so that i'll be all
[1:14:05] right all right so
[1:14:07] so we find that it goes all the way back
[1:14:10] to cain now i want you to look at the
[1:14:12] situation
[1:14:13] real close today with cain
[1:14:17] so cain didn't care
[1:14:21] that he had killed his brother even when
[1:14:24] he's confronted by god
[1:14:27] he doesn't care he doesn't even try to
[1:14:30] repent for it
[1:14:32] in fact as he tries to lie his way out
[1:14:34] of it
[1:14:36] you understand so he he didn't care
[1:14:39] at all and and so if you'll notice
[1:14:42] what cain cared about is he
[1:14:46] he complained that
[1:14:49] that my burden is greater than i can
[1:14:52] bear because
[1:14:53] i've chose to live my own life without
[1:14:56] you
[1:14:57] telling me what to do but if somebody
[1:15:00] meets me they'll
[1:15:01] kill me and i'm not gonna get i'm not
[1:15:03] gonna i'm getting the sword into the
[1:15:05] stick
[1:15:06] so gee if if i'm gonna choose my own way
[1:15:09] the least you could do is keep me from
[1:15:11] getting killed so that i can enjoy my
[1:15:13] life
[1:15:13] without your interference that i've
[1:15:15] chosen
[1:15:17] and so god said fine so god put a mark
[1:15:19] on him and said to the earth anybody
[1:15:21] that
[1:15:22] sees that mark and kills him then you'll
[1:15:24] be under my judgment
[1:15:25] so cain you understand cain didn't care
[1:15:29] he he he only worried that he wouldn't
[1:15:32] get to enjoy the life he had
[1:15:34] chosen which was free of god's oversight
[1:15:38] and limitations and the world
[1:15:41] is exactly the same today
[1:15:45] and so god is justified he's only giving
[1:15:48] them
[1:15:49] what they chose
[1:15:52] in every age you cannot impugn god's
[1:15:55] justice or righteousness that israel
[1:15:58] tried to say that they tried to accuse
[1:16:00] him
[1:16:01] of inequity and he wakes a prophet up
[1:16:04] and says take this down and go
[1:16:06] tell them i said it said go and say to
[1:16:08] them thus saith the lord you say
[1:16:10] i'm unfair you say i'm unequal
[1:16:13] i'm telling you you're the ones who are
[1:16:15] unequal
[1:16:16] you're the don't think i don't see you
[1:16:18] in your secret places
[1:16:20] sinning from the desires of your heart
[1:16:23] say well but good grief they didn't even
[1:16:25] have the holy ghost it's unfair
[1:16:27] david didn't have the holy ghost but
[1:16:29] david said i've hid his word in my heart
[1:16:30] i keep it before i tied it to my bed i
[1:16:33] don't want to sin against him
[1:16:34] it worried david that he did sin against
[1:16:37] him and he's always repenting
[1:16:40] see so there's no excuse there
[1:16:43] david said i love the law of god
[1:16:48] see david never saw it as limitations
[1:16:51] david saw god's word as protection
[1:16:55] and mercy and judgment he never saw it
[1:16:58] as god limiting him
[1:17:00] in his life amen now
[1:17:04] let's bring up my powerpoint brother
[1:17:05] josh

[1:18:43] your hands now
[1:18:44] modern ahab and jezebel see he called
[1:18:48] he called that jezebel system that was
[1:18:50] behind kennedy catholicism
[1:18:52] see we were talking uh i was in a
[1:18:55] minister's chat
[1:18:56] just yesterday seemed like somebody here
[1:18:58] in the church but um
[1:19:00] we we were talking about the the makeup
[1:19:03] of the supreme court of the united
[1:19:04] states it's almost entirely catholic
[1:19:07] like there's maybe one or two jews and
[1:19:10] the others are all catholic and that
[1:19:13] that if you go back
[1:19:14] a hundred years just a hundred years
[1:19:16] that's unheard of in american history
[1:19:18] they had back back in the day they had
[1:19:20] what they called the catholic seat
[1:19:22] they always wanted to have at least one
[1:19:24] catholic one
[1:19:26] on you know from from the from about the
[1:19:29] mid-1800s
[1:19:30] and so but that's all it ever was it was
[1:19:33] almost just like a little pat on the
[1:19:35] head okay we'll give you guys
[1:19:36] one seat at the table it is unheard of
[1:19:39] historically for this country
[1:19:41] that now catholics dominate
[1:19:45] our supreme court and now set in the
[1:19:47] white house
[1:19:48] and hold a majority in our congress in
[1:19:51] both chambers
[1:19:52] that's not an accident don't think
[1:19:56] that's happenstance
[1:19:58] that's not an accident that's god listen
[1:20:01] i was i was saying to you earlier that
[1:20:04] jesus was helping the prophecy remember
[1:20:06] i
[1:20:07] told you some weeks ago maybe in a
[1:20:08] sunday school class i don't remember
[1:20:10] that when god puts prophecy
[1:20:14] it's not just god by his foreknowledge
[1:20:16] he looks down the chain of time sees
[1:20:18] what's going to happen and has somebody
[1:20:19] write it in a book
[1:20:20] so that when it comes to pass it makes
[1:20:22] god look good that's not it
[1:20:24] god determines in his mind what history
[1:20:27] is going to be before its history
[1:20:29] and then he manipulates they politicians
[1:20:32] think they're in control
[1:20:34] kings monarchs prime ministers
[1:20:36] presidents they think they're in control
[1:20:38] they're not in control
[1:20:42] the circle is in control
[1:20:45] the kingdom of heaven is in control
[1:20:48] you need to remember that don't worry
[1:20:49] about what's happening in this world
[1:20:52] the eternal realms of heaven are in
[1:20:54] control
[1:20:56] i'm not subject as brother abraham says
[1:20:58] we're not we don't live by the mercies
[1:21:00] of lucifer
[1:21:01] we live by the mercies of jesus christ
[1:21:03] you need to put the devil in his place
[1:21:06] and just let him know i don't live by
[1:21:08] your mercies i'm not subject to you
[1:21:10] i'm i'm connected to almighty god
[1:21:15] watch so he says what you're going to do
[1:21:19] with it it's on your hands now modern
[1:21:20] ahab and jezebel the very thing that you
[1:21:23] run here for freedom
[1:21:24] you pulled yourself right back into it
[1:21:26] again but that's what you wanted
[1:21:28] you wanted some flat top ricky modern
[1:21:31] elvis of the day you got it
[1:21:33] you wanted a smart educated politician
[1:21:36] with a genius brain
[1:21:37] you got it how did you do it
[1:21:40] you don't want god's messiah the
[1:21:43] anointed word
[1:21:45] the word made manifest the word bringing
[1:21:48] itself forward
[1:21:49] you don't want that god sent it to you
[1:21:52] but the church don't want that they want
[1:21:54] their creed they want a genius that can
[1:21:57] fix creeds to where everything bounced
[1:21:59] to it
[1:22:00] you'll get it uh-huh it's on its road
[1:22:02] you got a lot of children to it
[1:22:04] but there's going to be a grandpa raise
[1:22:06] up one of these days of pharaoh who
[1:22:08] doesn't know joseph
[1:22:10] say something friends we were remarking
[1:22:12] i was remarking in a minister's chat
[1:22:14] two two big headlines that have hit one
[1:22:16] came out of israel
[1:22:18] and israel one of their leading voices
[1:22:20] in israel
[1:22:21] they were asking him about the vaccine
[1:22:23] coming
[1:22:24] and said are you going to force israelis
[1:22:26] to take the vaccine he said well
[1:22:28] we're not it's not exactly like we're
[1:22:30] going to force you to take it
[1:22:32] and i'm not here for khan i'm not pro or
[1:22:34] con the vaccine that's not my sermon
[1:22:35] today
[1:22:36] i'm just saying this is this is modern
[1:22:38] events made clear in prophecy
[1:22:39] and he says it's not like we're going to
[1:22:41] force you to do it
[1:22:42] but we we may make it so that where you
[1:22:45] can't buy sell or trade unless you have
[1:22:47] it
[1:22:48] amen amen and then
[1:22:52] the very same day or maybe the next
[1:22:53] morning this is even a bigger headline
[1:22:56] francis the pope of rome has now entered
[1:22:58] into a consortium into a deal into a
[1:23:01] into a group effort with big wall street
[1:23:03] businesses big blue chip companies
[1:23:05] they've got plans for 2021
[1:23:08] and doesn't the bible say that rome will
[1:23:10] rule through commerce and through trade
[1:23:12] and through craft
[1:23:14] listen friends i'm here to tell you
[1:23:15] that's not the devil gaining ground
[1:23:18] that's god moving his puppet
[1:23:21] hallelujah god is moving his puppet i'm
[1:23:24] here to tell you that same god is
[1:23:26] perfecting you
[1:23:27] that same god is keeping your mind clear
[1:23:30] and keeping the insanity out of your
[1:23:31] homes
[1:23:32] oh we ought to rejoice and praise god
[1:23:35] for that
[1:23:36] i'm glad he's in control of these things
[1:23:39] watch he goes on
[1:23:45] and that's what you wanted see that's
[1:23:49] what paul dealt with in
[1:23:50] in romans 10. look this is what israeli
[1:23:53] don't thank god some evil ogre for
[1:23:54] condemning them that's what they wanted
[1:23:57] when jesus confronted them in john 8 and
[1:24:00] he said
[1:24:00] you're trying to kill me you're of your
[1:24:02] father the devil that's what they wanted
[1:24:03] they even conspired
[1:24:05] when they couldn't deny his miracles
[1:24:08] they couldn't deny him
[1:24:09] and and they said so who's authority
[1:24:12] he said who's authority to preach do do
[1:24:15] do cast
[1:24:16] out devils and we think you do it by
[1:24:18] beelzebub
[1:24:19] and jesus with his sense of humor says
[1:24:21] that's interesting
[1:24:24] okay so if i cast out satan by beelzebub
[1:24:27] exactly who is it your sons cast him out
[1:24:29] by because his sons
[1:24:30] their sons weren't casting out any
[1:24:32] devils so the whole thing was like
[1:24:35] uh who was that excuse me you want to
[1:24:38] tell me that miracle they just did
[1:24:39] what was that i can't hear you
[1:24:43] and when they say oh by whose
[1:24:45] authorities do you do it he said well
[1:24:46] i'll i'll answer that if you answer me
[1:24:49] john's ministry was he of god or no
[1:24:50] simple question you'd think anybody
[1:24:52] could just go
[1:24:53] well it's a or b a curtain one or two
[1:24:55] it's a simple question it's pretty
[1:24:56] straightforward he's not ambiguous he's
[1:24:58] not
[1:24:58] double speaking this is just a simple
[1:25:00] question john was a well-known ministry
[1:25:02] is it of god or no yes or no
[1:25:04] and they have to huddle
[1:25:08] come here boys okay here's a problem
[1:25:12] if we say no we're probably gonna get
[1:25:14] killed because all the people think he
[1:25:15] was
[1:25:16] but if we say yes he was of god then
[1:25:17] he's gonna ask us then why didn't you
[1:25:19] believe what he said about me
[1:25:21] so they come back with a great answer
[1:25:25] we don't know
[1:25:28] we can't tell he said fine neither tell
[1:25:31] iu by what authority i cast out devils
[1:25:34] go on with your bad self go on that's
[1:25:36] what you wanted
[1:25:37] that's what a prophet is here doing go
[1:25:39] ahead america
[1:25:40] it's what you wanted you didn't want god
[1:25:43] you didn't want god man flesh
[1:25:45] you didn't want a prophet you didn't
[1:25:46] want to you didn't want to observe the
[1:25:48] life of god's family
[1:25:49] and pattern yourself after that you
[1:25:51] wanted a man with a genius brain
[1:25:54] somebody who could fix up your politics
[1:25:56] and make everybody else follow you
[1:25:59] you got it go ahead you know you know
[1:26:01] why cities are burning
[1:26:04] because of that amen because of that
[1:26:08] and that's what you wanted that's what
[1:26:09] the church you can see the very way
[1:26:12] they're doing yes sir the very way
[1:26:14] revelation 17 explains it of the old
[1:26:17] and her daughters exactly
[1:26:19] and it'll all go back home to mama
[1:26:23] and it's on its road right now to make
[1:26:26] one
[1:26:26] universal church you're going to get
[1:26:29] just exactly denominations
[1:26:31] what you want hear me
[1:26:34] it'll come to pass and i may be gone by
[1:26:37] that time
[1:26:38] but those who won't accept that when the
[1:26:40] evening light begins to fall and go out
[1:26:43] they look around they they see they're
[1:26:45] forced into something by their
[1:26:47] denomination and their denomination has
[1:26:48] took it to save their faces which
[1:26:50] they'll
[1:26:51] all do it they'll all do it
[1:26:55] now he comes after the seals watch this
[1:26:57] he comes here um
[1:26:58] in in november 1963 he's
[1:27:01] on the same subject the world is again
[1:27:04] falling apart
[1:27:05] and so does the word of god you can't
[1:27:07] take a church
[1:27:09] and bring it to life on some tradition
[1:27:12] you might bring
[1:27:13] members by the millions but you'll never
[1:27:16] bring down the power of god
[1:27:18] until we get back to the original
[1:27:21] word back to the foundational word back
[1:27:25] to the blood
[1:27:26] back to jesus christ back to
[1:27:28] old-fashioned prayer meetings
[1:27:29] back to god so
[1:27:33] what do you want bethel tabernacle do
[1:27:34] you want to grow this church into the
[1:27:36] millions
[1:27:37] or would you rather have the power of
[1:27:38] god
[1:27:40] hallelujah i make my choice today let
[1:27:43] the world hear it i choose the word
[1:27:46] i choose god i'm not interested in
[1:27:48] numbers i'm interested
[1:27:49] in the holy spirit
[1:27:52] i want to see it anoint marriages and
[1:27:54] anoint homes and anoint teenagers
[1:27:56] and anoint the old and raise up the dead
[1:27:59] and heal the sick and i want to see the
[1:28:00] power of god
[1:28:01] keep my mind sane
[1:28:05] in an insane world
[1:28:10] make your choice because you can
[1:28:17] but anyhow he says we may be so far gone
[1:28:21] now that the hours far past but anyhow
[1:28:23] the gospel must be preached we're not to
[1:28:24] judge that
[1:28:25] see we just keep preaching it till he
[1:28:27] comes
[1:28:31] god knew what they had need of
[1:28:34] so he gave them what they had need of
[1:28:37] so again we find what they had we have
[1:28:41] done the same thing
[1:28:42] russia and all the rest of them wants
[1:28:43] theirs and the different scientists
[1:28:45] wants to make themselves a great name
[1:28:46] enoch each nation wants to get its
[1:28:49] brainy man

[1:28:52] system in it we want a denominationalism

[1:29:56] russians are calling for a man who can
[1:29:58] conquer space

[1:30:01] they're scientists what if they get one
[1:30:03] what if they get their messiah what we
[1:30:05] gonna do and mercy on us if they get it
[1:30:07] remember germany got such a messiah not

[1:30:11] know what it done to them
[1:30:14] amen now what about the church what kind

[1:30:45] christian i don't want that among you i
[1:30:48] don't want that among me

[1:30:52] give our whole
[1:30:53] hearts and minds unreservedly to the
[1:30:56] word of this
[1:30:57] hour and so that the holy spirit can
[1:30:59] anoint that word in you
[1:31:03] that's the only way it's it's it's
[1:31:06] it's it's what it's the magical force
[1:31:09] it's an anointing
[1:31:10] that comes down upon the word to make it
[1:31:13] live
[1:31:14] see it moves between us and it'll anoint
[1:31:17] good or bad
[1:31:19] it'll anoint the dark side or it'll
[1:31:21] anoint the sight of light

[1:34:44] i'm here to tell you there's a power
[1:34:46] that can come down into your life
[1:34:48] and clean out your heart and clean out
[1:34:50] your mind
[1:34:52] hallelujah
[1:34:55] oh my
[1:34:58] i'm out of time let me try to finish
[1:35:01] revive okay what are we looking for what
[1:35:04] what what more do you want
[1:35:05] what does the church want anyhow we've
[1:35:09] already got it
[1:35:10] god gave it to us it's his promise for
[1:35:13] this hour we
[1:35:14] look in the bible we see it everywhere
[1:35:15] through the bible anointed ones
[1:35:18] come on and and made the word live again
[1:35:21] right in the hour for that hour and
[1:35:23] we've got the messiah this is him the
[1:35:26] word
[1:35:26] in the beginning was the word it it
[1:35:30] blows
[1:35:30] my mind that people try to assert
[1:35:34] that william branham led people to
[1:35:37] himself
[1:35:38] that is the dumbest thing if you ever
[1:35:40] knew anything about message
[1:35:42] here's what he led you to his entire
[1:35:45] ministry
[1:35:47] it is a flat bald-faced lie
[1:35:51] with malice they intend to deceive by
[1:35:54] that
[1:35:54] he always led people to the word he
[1:35:57] never led people to himself
[1:36:02] the word in the beginning was the word
[1:36:04] and the word was with god
[1:36:06] and the word was god and the word
[1:36:08] remains god hebrews 13 8 the same
[1:36:11] yesterday
[1:36:12] today and forever we know what is
[1:36:14] supposed to take place in this day
[1:36:16] we're wanting a messiah and god gave us
[1:36:18] the messiah his promised word for this
[1:36:20] day
[1:36:20] it's just waiting here you go it's just
[1:36:23] waiting for somebody with faith
[1:36:25] to anoint it and make it live again yes
[1:36:27] sir it's a real messiah
[1:36:29] it's the words of god which jesus said
[1:36:32] both heavens and earth will pass away
[1:36:34] but my word shall never pass away but
[1:36:37] the church sits spiritually dead
[1:36:39] gone the hours past them they're in a
[1:36:41] slump they hardly know what to do
[1:36:43] one running this way and one that way
[1:36:45] and ever hear
[1:36:46] every promise that god made in the bible
[1:36:49] every one of them
[1:36:50] is laying there just as good as they
[1:36:52] ever was can you believe that
[1:36:54] can you believe that every promise no
[1:36:56] matter how many thousands of years old
[1:36:58] it might be
[1:36:59] it's just as good today as it was when
[1:37:01] it was written
[1:37:03] amen every one of them as good as they
[1:37:06] ever was it's the hour what makes the
[1:37:08] church
[1:37:09] like this we're in the age of laodicea
[1:37:12] when she has to come this way this is
[1:37:15] the
[1:37:15] hour for it amen
[1:37:18] that's what god knew would happen
[1:37:21] in this life i'm gonna tell you
[1:37:22] something friends i i find myself
[1:37:26] living in a completely different realm

[1:43:14] god and say lord remember me
[1:43:16] a sinner today have mercy on my life

[1:43:26] years and i'm a believer of it today and
[1:43:28] i'm not
[1:43:29] a fake i really believe it i believe it
[1:43:32] for real i know it's true
[1:43:35] but i'm also aware that my life ain't
[1:43:38] anywhere where it needs to be and i
[1:43:40] haven't felt the anointing of the holy
[1:43:42] spirit like he promised in a long time
[1:43:44] and i want the lord to remember me maybe
[1:43:46] you'd raise up a hand today
[1:43:48] god sees it friends god sees it
[1:43:52] maybe you're here today you say brother

[1:44:01] say i want more of god
[1:44:03] lord i want more of you in my life that
[1:44:05] should cover everybody today
[1:44:07] i did it that way on purpose
[1:44:11] so that nobody could say you left me out
[1:44:15] i didn't leave anybody out i gave you an
[1:44:18] opportunity today to know him
[1:44:20] for the first time or to know him in a
[1:44:22] renewed way
[1:44:24] or to know him in a greater way
[1:44:27] so i'm gonna pray for you now with all
[1:44:29] your heads still bowed master
[1:44:31] whatever hands went up thou knowest lord
[1:44:34] even if hands didn't go up no doubt
[1:44:36] hearts reached up to you
[1:44:38] sometimes people can get so caught lord
[1:44:41] in the complexes of life
[1:44:42] they hardly can get a hand up but yet
[1:44:44] their heart can cry out
[1:44:46] maybe someone is calling out to you
[1:44:49] right now saying lord
[1:44:51] here i am under the pile of all this
[1:44:53] flesh
[1:44:54] and i'm calling for help i'm sorry for
[1:44:57] my life i'm sorry that i've
[1:44:59] i've been an underachiever in your
[1:45:01] kingdom
[1:45:03] but i'm crying out to you from
[1:45:05] underneath all this flesh
