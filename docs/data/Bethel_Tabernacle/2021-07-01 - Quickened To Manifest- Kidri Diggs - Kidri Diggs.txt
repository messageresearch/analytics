my my own this i can't even trust my own decisions hey man i have to solely lean on him amen and that way whatever happens is his will amen so that's the way i want to be a man i want to just be leaning on god i thank god for all of you pastor amen different ministering brothers the government of the church amen let's just go before the lord in prayer and we'll get right into the word of god if you have a need tonight just know that our god is able and he's a prayer answering god let's pray lord jesus father we deem it a privilege to be in the presence of saints with like precious faith lord and lord know that we're in perilous times lord and lord for the unbeliever these are weary days but for us lord we're looking at something to come lord lord we're looking at a a new life lord a a new house a new way of living father that you promised us lord lord you said the right mental attitude to bring any divine promise to pass or even every divine promise to pass so lord we pray for that right mental attitude lord lord that tonight we'll be sober minded lord lord god that we won't just get drunk on on unnatural things but lord in the spirit lord we'll be we'll be conscious we'll

through us lord and and lord let the hearer hear the voice of god and lord god let us be careful how we're here and lord give us understanding and lord we pray the blessing of the kingdom be upon us lord and that that that sacrificial lamb that that that covenant blood just continues to brood over our lives lord we kept we'll be giving you all the praise and glory and honor in the wonderful name of jesus christ we pray the church amen amen if you have your bible let's turn to um the book of john st john chapter one saint john chapter one i hope you guys are still kind of bubbly based upon the meetings that you just had because we we're talking about it up in our area hey man i mean it was just it was just it was just good well but no i can't say that cause chicken is good it was great holly look at that hallelujah how many feel that way amen church we are we ought to look for these kind of times in the lord amen when we get so caught up we just lose ourselves amen thank you jesus let's go to uh saint john chapter one and i wanna i wanna start reading that verse ten he was in the world in the world was made by him and and the word and the world knew him not he came unto his own and his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood not of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of god hallelujah amen let's go to romans chapter 8. romans chapter 8 let's uh start at verse 18. romans 8 18 the bible says for i reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of god hallelujah may the lord have a blessing to the reading of his word you can have your seats amen by god's grace um we want to use for a subject tonight quicken to manifest quicker to manifest and just to give you a little insight uh i believe the last time i was here i i i spoke about um god's expectation and you know this message right here is you know how you have a a hurricane right and the hurricane out on the ocean is full speed and it's maybe uh uh 200 miles per hour but as it hits land it begins to break off into other storms but all those storms are part of the initial hurricane and that's what this message is tonight this message is kind of a a tropical storm breaking off from god's expectation but if we can kind of if you kind of want to say a part two i don't i don't really know if it's a part two or not but we're kind of gonna be dealing with the same area so to speak but quicken to manifest you know the bible says that we were once dead and trespassed and sin but thee we were quickened amen quicken means to be made alive so church there's no reason why if we say we're being quickened by god god has given us a messenger and the word has has come to to make us live and we're alive there's no reason why we should have dead services there's no reasons why our worship should be dead our anything we do for god should be dead because we've been made alive there's there's a reason why god has quickened us and it's simply to manifest his life amen but you know as as i look and we think that you know just coming to churches because no coming to church is not good enough you have a purpose amen god created you with the purpose of a seed being inside of you hallelujah and just saying like this that uh the condition of the world from the beginning of time it made parts of god manifest hallelujah you know the prophet of god said that the condition of the sin it brought out more of the attributes of god you know there was no sickness so uh god being a healer he had to allow that so the attribute of who he was could come out hallelujah see god is all about demonstrating his life hallelujah but what i love about it he's made us a part of his life so who's the worst demonstrate now hallelujah you got something to do you got something to manifest if you are part of god's attributes this world this hour is calling for you to manifest god hallelujah we got to be more than just good christians sitting in a message believing church but there are people who need the attributes of god like there were people who needed healing there were people who needed salvation there were people that needed deliverance and the condition of the world made god unveil himself hallelujah so i'm saying if that same attribute of god has been quicker than you it will cause you to manifest who god is hallelujah oh my oh wow holy i feel like i'm in the park hallelujah glory and you just think about it quicken made alive church we're in a place where uh god told abraham he said there's nothing that i'll hide from abraham hallelujah because abraham went through all the testings of god to manifest the character of god and you think about a church all the things we go through it's very simple god is bringing us back into his image hallelujah so don't look at your trials as oh my like brother jews say why is he rousey wu no what he's doing is he's bringing forth a real live manifestation of his person hallelujah hallelujah and what a privilege it is hallelujah to not be just in the catholic church or or pentecostal church but we have the word of the hour hallelujah you know we say that so much that it doesn't even arise us anymore the message of the hour the message of the hour the message of the hour what does that mean that means that this message for this hour is here to manifest the character of god because in every hour there was a message and for that hour the people were quickened to manifest the life of god hallelujah and every age church if we could go as far back as let's just start let's just say luther hallelujah when the word was manifest in his hour what did he do he brought forth the character of faith hallelujah so he was quickened he was made alive even though he was in a dead church you see how powerful your calling is oh my let's read a little bit amen um i don't know if i have this one up there but uh let's go with it by the grace of god listen we're talking about is there's another scripture you know where it says if the spirit that raised up christ from the dead dwells in you it will also quicken your mortal body it will make your mortal body hallelujah do things supernatural wow hallelujah that spirit inside hallelujah if it raised up christ from the dead it has the same ability in you to do the same thing you did in christ we're not dealing with a different god we're not dealing with a different holy ghost we're not even dealing with different circumstances because god remains the same holy he created hallelujah everything around you to bring forth more of himself so what we ought to do is say lord here am i use me but look church he said if that spirit that raised up christ from the dead dwells in you it shall also quicken your mortal body that's the part that catches us we're waiting on a rapture no hallelujah you're going to manifest god on this side because that's the only way the rapture is going to take place is if god sees himself down here on this earth first hungry it's not going to take place because everything is right in heaven no it's going to take place because everything is right on earth in the believer that is hallelujah but we think about it the same god we should look for the same manifestation the same attributes the same character the same nature hollywood if you are quickened it will manifest the same god hallelujah don't let that go over your head now think about what god has done in your life has he been a healer to you talk to me church amen has he been your joy has he been your deliverance has he been your all in all and now he's saying that you are his attributes so it's time for you to be a deliverer church think about this i'm here because somebody i know got saved and demonstrated life before me it wasn't that i sat down and i read the book and the book started glowing and i was like wow god is calling me no i saw a converted parrot hardly i saw a converted mama hallelujah who was dedicated her to let god manifest himself out of her and that same life her would captivate me her being made alive she was quickened to manifest god as a savior and i saw god in her and i wanted to be saved and it's the same thing hallelujah life hallelujah breeds life so if you're quickened hurry it's for you to manifest more of god but we look we get we get we get we get stumped but we think about how powerful god is and all the things that we that he does and we say lord not me you're exactly right not you the seed in you amen i just love how brother jason put it on the bible study one day he said hear people say all the time i'm predestinated i'm predestinated i'm predestinated before the foundation of the world i'm predestinated why i'm predestinated he says no you're not it's that seed inside that's predestinated holy remember the bible says flesh and blood shall not inherit the kingdom of god so what is god coming back for his very own life the seed that he planted in you and i before the foundation of the world once it starts to manifest the character of god it gets god's attention you notice that mother eagle didn't search into the eggs she didn't go looking for an egg hallelujah until there was something to look for until there was something to respond to the eagle's cry glory hallelujah cause look the prophet of god let me read this for you y'all know me it don't it don't take 500 people for me to get excited it don't even take 10 holidays because when i start to think about what god has done for me and you know my i can feel god bringing me to a place you know where my heart's desire is to manifest the words that paul said if i glory i'm a glory of the things i've suffered knowing that those things are bringing me to the light of christ like perfection oh holy church did joseph know that all his trials and tribulation was leading him to the throne hardly here second in charge he had to fight jealousy he had to fight lies he had to fight pride he had to fight her sexual demons all kind of stuff he even had to fight loneliness but all of that put him at the top of his sprint his place and all those spirits that he had to fight god put it all back in the palm of his hand wow reason why you don't give it to some of us right now because we can't handle it holy there are gifts of the spirit land in the church but the reason why they don't operate for one hallelujah we're not sold out enough hallelujah for two hallelujah if god was to show us some things that's going on amongst our sisters and brothers we'll treat them different because we don't have the character yet so god lets you go through things why to develop compassion wow hallelujah hallelujah so when you see somebody's child go to the world you have compassion why because he let yours go hallelujah oh you see somebody you know what we always say we'll say somebody get sick somebody get covered and we say we're going to pray behind the devil up buying the devil up and the person come to tell you they'll be like well i'm struggling please pray for me and all we can say is pile the devil up buy the devil up but then it starts happening to you where's all that binding devil up then oh be patient with me be patient with me i'm i'm not quite there yet but i'm trusting and believing oh you trusting and believing now when there's somebody else by the devil to pat him up see what i love about god we're in a time right now holly where god is dealing with the person in the mirror we got to take our eyes off the people that left take your eyes on the people that's criticizing and look at what you're manifesting hallelujah do you realize that your life could be so powerful enough it can make all the people behind you get courage david's life was so powerful a army that was paralyzed david set everybody free when the life went down why because he came to manifest that god was a warrior goliath was created so david could kill him wow that was his only purpose and he was created hallelujah as a legend hallelujah he defeated this land that land this land that land he had a great reputation god let him get really big so he can make david bigger and you're wondering why you're here because there's parts of god there's parts of god's attribute that this hour is calling for god is calling for a people that will restore the rainbow not for pride day they will restore the covenant hallelujah say that coveted rainbow belongs to the bride wow you were created in this day hallelujah where you have to fight those kind of spirits and not fight the people look church there are things that only you will quicken so you can manifest nobody else could beat goliath but david saul was about six nine two hallelujah you know back in those days i was considered to be a giant see we thinking eight feet ten feet tall no remember god don't change he's the same if the whole nations are eight feet ten feet where are they now he has to be the same so i give you seven feet i get six nine plenty of them hallelujah so church let's let's let's let's be sober when we read the bible god is not gonna put anything out of your reach hallelujah so we're looking at goliath as a 10-foot giant hallelujah and you look at that you'll be like god i can't kill somebody 10 feet but let's bring them down to 6 9. that's still a giant to me hallelujah because he because he was 10 centimeters taller than me so in my in my face he's a giant hallelujah but if he's a giant god manifests me he quickened me holly to understand that there's nothing too tall or too big for my god hallelujah but you look church just i i feel my helper brother jason hallelujah look church you think about it everybody else talk of life nation at the nation kingdom of the kingdom and his reputation went throughout the whole earth and he was so confident in who he was hallelujah his confidence was spewing out of his mouth he'd go down to the army and say bring me a man one of the greatest trash talkers that ever lived i hope you all ain't afraid of a little devil trash talk because god is already dealt with his trash talk somebody gonna cut your lights off he gonna take your children you ain't gonna pay your bills god didn't already dealt with spiritual trash talk and he was so bold harley see he was manifesting the life of his father here hallelujah all talk and no substance in the presence of god notice i said in the presence of god around unbelievers he was somebody big but to david he was just another man he was just another man notice one time david never called him a giant wow he never called him a giant david said it just like he was supposed to be saying you're an unbeliever right and you going down right i'm gonna cut your head off and i don't even have a sword come on church david was mad if david was quickened to manifest faith hallelujah in the unseen realm david was quick and hardly to speak things into existence that looked like it shouldn't be in that hour that was his hour it was none of his brothers and some of them were bigger than he was it wasn't saul and none of the other mighty men that were there it was only david david was there hallelujah why because goliath was on the scene so when goliath was born david had to be born because in god's mind only david could take care of him oh hallelujah so you had to be in this day to fight a covet all right i just heard a testimony from a friend of mine in london church he he uh uh constructed i can't think of the right contract or whatever they call it covet and it messed up his respiratory system and he started breathing real bad his wife was you know they were sitting at home and they were saying well let's pray about let's pray about it then it got to a place i think she was a nurse where she tested his chest and full of fluid and it's when that happened you go on your way out and she said i can't take it no longer let's go to the hospital talk to the hospital they put them on a respirator and they say look you got to be on this respirator for a couple hours the couple hours turned into 12 days and in those 12 days when he got there he slipped into a coma so 12 days he was in a coma fighting coven how was he fighting by the prayers of the saints wow there were people in his church that would manifest for that hour just to pray for him they might not they might not never do anything else hallelujah but god heard their prayers holly they were quickened quicker to what hallelujah to believe that god asked his prayer and they had to be in their position praying for that brother because he couldn't pray that's why the scripture calls us kings and priests because somebody had to be there to step in the role of an intercessor he's still the same god remember that scripture because jesus said holy the devil desires to sift you as weak but i have prayed for you hallelujah before it even happens god says i have prayed for you hallelujah and luke church they were looking for him to die but the saints kept praying and then all of a sudden he woke up amen what did you expect when believers pray i don't know about y'all but look joshua was manifest to come after moses holly because he was going to do things in his church that them hard-headed believers wouldn't do in moses church so joshua had to have an attitude that i'm not going to put up with all the slandering of a prophet when you act up we're gonna kill you and your whole family your cousins everybody remember god told them do not touch your cursing things and again say well uh was it was he a prophet before 63 or after 63. you couldn't do that in joshua church was no reasoning in that church whatever the prophet said it was a prophet speaking hallelujah but you know now we're in a day where we have a reasoning spirit where people say well did he say that before 63 or after 63. i know i was preaching someplace i ain't going to say the name but a brother came up to me after church and i still called him a brother he came with me out of church he said well brother this and that this he said you kind of lost me and i was talking about the god of the universe before there was ever a universe he was just self-existing he was just he wasn't even god yet hallelujah he was just a great eternal he was like oh brother you know this and that blah blah blah you know he said you just kind of lost my saying what and he started saying what i said i said you believe the prophet he said yeah i believe the prophet so i showed him the direct quote i was quoting so you see that you're a believer huh there go huh you believe it look at it look at it he said well uh i believe him after 63. i looked him straight in his face and i said you know what you ain't a believer wow right there in this church and let me tell you something people will respect you when you're honest with them you need to tell me i'mma get there and preach my heart out and then you're gonna come to me and tell me it wasn't god you think i'm gonna sit there and let you bark at me like that and you haven't noticed honey i'm a bloodhound but sometimes i can turn into a lion oh man all this just you think about preachers that you like to criticize and brother i'm telling my real preachers holy those field preachers that stay in labor and and praying do all these things and even get in the pulpit and afraid that they're going to say something wrong and you got the courage to walk up to them and say that wasn't god you heard what god told miriam and aaron he said are you afraid of god you're going to talk to moses like that he said i talk to others through dreams and and different things he said but it ain't so with moses i speak face to face lift the ear with him and you don't go up there and judge a man by his mistakes or you're gonna judge him by his trials you're gonna judge him by his family no judging by his convictions because what you don't see is what's really in that man's heart he may be up there nervous as all get out and say lord please not me but you speak i don't know where that one come from if we got some critics in here well no i ain't gonna put that on you normally the critics are online watch out watch out because some of them are smart enough to know if you come and sit in here we can pick up your spirit and start preaching directly to you and bro jason i'm one of those who don't mind talking directly to you if you got that spirit on you but you guys are my family hallelujah like brother brown i'm saying we fussed like cats and dogs in the backyard but when you mess with one of us out front holly although i may be from columbus you gonna talk about my friends in beaufort i don't care how hot you say it is down here i got some people i love down there they smoking they on fire hallelujah that's why i love going down there i told one brother the mosquitoes that big down here i say but i love coming amen but jason i don't know if you remember this years ago we did an outreach in the park it was me you brother burley hallelujah brother bernie was preaching i was singing because y'all know i love the worship holly and burlesque barely said he said brothers what you gonna wait it's my first time coming he said what you gonna wear i said i'm gonna put on a t-shirt i mean you know like a flannel or something this and they say charlottesville yeah so they're gonna eat you alive i said oh brother i just put on some offers whatever you call stuff you say brother they gonna eat you alive these mosquitoes are very disrespectful and don't let me talk about the sand flies you got to be a special breed of person to stay down here hallelujah a canadian can't come down here and be satisfied he got to be converted to know that god calls him to this place and you think about it that man has been all over the world why he keep coming back to this heat it's his calling hallelujah and i love it you know sometimes i i kind of got off but sometimes i go into cold areas especially canada up there with brother eugene and i go up there they'll be like oh brother dicks this is cold i said yeah it's cold it's minus 40. and they're laughing and they're having good jokes with me they're calling me weak cause i'm all cold and i got all three coats and all that stuff and i look at them and i say you know what i'd love to have you in carolina in the middle of july come on and we'll see how brave you is then we'll see you laughing then holly don't mess with me i was manifest to live in the heat i feel like mike tyson out of retirement hallelujah i'm alive again let me move on look listen what he says church now he says that same spirit that raised up christ christ out of the dead quicken your mortal body hallelujah look he says he says now this is this is uh verse this paragraph 86 gideon he says uh now the holy spirit is here on the earth looking out for those individuals that god has ordained to life in this age hallelujah think about that church now what he's doing is he just got finished talking about the the eagle and he says how that eagle knows how many eggs it had had he said but some kind of way one gets lost so he takes the one hallelujah and it goes and sits on that and hatches and once that one hatches that mother eagle starts searching for the other egg and he says the holy spirit hallelujah is here looking out holy those individuals that god has a day to life in this age so the holy spirit is searching for you that's what these anointings is in church holy god is trying to quicken that life so the real you can come out this ain't about just gathering in bethel tabernacle no there's a quicker thing going on the word is here to make you alive a baptist doctrine couldn't do it a catholic doctrine couldn't do it a pentecostal couldn't do it it has to be the word for your power what kind of word for your hour remember luther's hour the word was faith whether it's the world was satisfication and there were individuals quickened to manifest what they were preaching i hope you're with me church there were people hallelujah who didn't even know who they were to those reformers started preaching the word they look like just ordinary people holy you know that you're so special you can make preachers preach on your trial it just happened several times and you heard and i can't get this out of my system every time i get down in prayer all i can hear is rachel putting restore all over the house now i think that happened just for us to say my she's close to god that happened for all of us so we could see that god hears our prayer we just got to get desperate holy and you know what i do for man you know what i do i get down in prayer i say lord you did it for rachel and matt you did it for them you can't be a respected person right and i know we believe the same thing so i said god you heard her prayer holy when you said our restored you weren't just talking to her you were talking to all of us [Applause] but that's what we do we look at god answering the prayer of one of our brothers and sisters and we think it's just for them no she was quicker to manifest that in your ears what is it really saying what it's really saying is that the word that's coming over this pulpit this pulpit holy is producing real believers that can get in contact with god and don't get jealous and you just sit there and say well god ain't asking my prayer ask yourself why there's nothing wrong with god if prayers are not being answered the problem always relies with that person in the mirror but he says the walking he's even showed it to me a different way that church even sometimes when you pray the answer may not come simply because it's not time because remember it took 21 days god already had the answer coming but it took 21 days hallelujah the angels just had to fight some demons hallelujah but what i love about it when they got through hallelujah the angel said he said dale as soon as you turn your face holy rachel as soon as you turn your face god was putting it on brother john's heart to preach our restore and that's a message hold you that's a message to all your children hallelujah everything that you love hallelujah y'all better pay attention because your parents got contact with god don't try to live your own life holly because they sitting there hardly they were created hardly to stand guard over you hallelujah listen he says now the holy spirit is here on earth looking out for those individuals that god has ordained to life in this age and as soon as it finds it it does look at us now it does just like it did on jesus christ so when the holy spirit finds you it has to manifest the same thing it did in christ i know that went over some of y'all heard but i want you to put your big gloves out look this is not a playoff we in the world series right now holy you got to put your gloves up hallelujah you got to catch everything god is saying to you if it looks like it's going over the fence ask god to let you fly yeah come on go up there and get it hallelujah there was a song that said i believe i can fly listen he said it does just like it did in jesus christ the great super son of god who redeemed us all it comes down and takes his place of a bold into the human life now he's talking about the holy spirit he's talking about the same life of christ once you're quickened the word of god the spirit of god the life of god comes down in you and it takes it abold now you tell me hallelujah if god comes inside of you what should it manifest god cause brother branham said if i had the spirit of john diliger you expect me to be shooting guns cause i got his spirit he said if i had a spirit of some super mechanic you expect me to be able to fix things he said if i had the spirit of beethoven you expect me to orchestrate but i ain't got none of those spirits i got the spirit of jesus christ [Applause] hallelujah so when we pray we should expect demons to when we move we should expect creation to listen [Applause] because we're quickened to manifest the life of god he said it comes down and takes his abode in the human life now notice how you brought the quickening power he said now that quickening power that comes upon jesus quickened him to manifest every promise of the word of that day so why did god send a message for us to manifest every promise for our day you know church i'll be looking at the titles of the message sometimes and god has shown me that more than just titles spoken word is the original seed that's an event given to the believer her christ the mystery of god revealed that's a manifestation in the believer's life and i got i just got one that just sets me on a rooftop holy the prophet of god here was inspired he was quickened to preach a message called the mighty god unveiled hallelujah church that's not a title god was actually showing the believers i'm here i'm here and then he didn't got the prophet to say holy god says things hallelujah that fears down the crowd because some people can't see god being god inside of their weak flesh but let me tell you something the flesh of jesus was just as weak as yours but what made it strong was the spirit inside his flesh could bleed his flesh could hurt his flesh could black style but what stopped all that spirit inside he didn't put you in a different body of flesh it's the same flesh that's why he had to give us the same spirit wow hallelujah he said oh but jesus you know his flesh was stronger than ours no flesh is flesh it was the character and nature of god holy without sin living in that body that's why i could overcome every temptation it could overcome every reasoning spirit hallelujah why because of that spirit inside holy look jesus holy let me finish reading it he had a purpose amen he said now the quickening power that came up on jesus quicken him listen the prophet god said jesus was quickened wow he was made alive house ago that the first adam was a was it was a was it was a hyper rejection the first adam was living so the second album was a quickening spirit y'all keep pulling it's coming to me see he's trying to tell us hallelujah this is not just a body that god created to be a trophy he didn't want adam to be a trophy he let adam go his own way make his own decisions hallelujah to show us that no matter what you do hallelujah he'll still call your name and put you back in position i know about y'all i did some things that are not worthy of this gospel holly but it's too late god has already fell in love with me it's too late he's already given me the holy spirit and he can't take it back with all my mistakes with all my shortcomings hallelujah i'm gonna read you something else and he gonna shake your boots he said quicken him to manifest every promise of the word of that day think about that church god gave us a message for this hour we were quickened to manifest every word for our day [Music] and i know sometimes you think he said oh god use brother brethren he wants to use you he said so does the holy spirit that comes upon us this day if it's not a mockery holy spirit if it's not the devil mark in the holy spirit but it's but is the real true holy spirit it'll manifest the promise of this hour of this hour so that means hallelujah every revealed word belongs to us hallelujah everything that that prophet preached by revelation for our day belongs to you and i yeah everything hallelujah events taking place hallelujah you know i was even thinking about the seventh seal earlier you know uh the real mystery of the seventh seal is is is is is you know god incompletion hallelujah it's not necessarily i mean there is a seal that had to be opened and loosed and all these things but there's a greater seal hallelujah of the seven seals that we go over hallelujah remember the bible said hallelujah that in that capstone there was a ceiling starting with virtue hallelujah and it took all of those seals hallelujah to get us to the top hunley but see the thing about those seals nobody knows you got it or not but you and god nobody knows if you got real patience so god will put you in place to manifest it hallelujah nobody knows if you got temporary self-control so god will put you in a position where you can manifest that ceiling oh my thank god for the opening of the seals no the service seal has been opened is not silent because i can feel godliness brotherly kindness and all these things working in my life oh my look i'm gonna try to move kind of quickly because i want to hold y'all too long look give me give me eight or seven gideon he says now um what i'm talking about when the word came in a particular hour we believe we got the message of the hour right now you what what we're gonna show you how the prophet preached that for every hour a word came in and manifested to a people hallelujah and it and it and it fulfilled what that word was saying he said when it fell upon luther it manifests that promise of that hour when it fell upon wesley it manifests the promise of that hour when it fail when it falls in this day it manifests the promise of this hour when it fail upon moses it manifests the promise hallelujah of that hour he says fell upon knowing now this is where i want to stop hardly god created noah because noah was the only one that could make it rain was the only one that could make it rain there were people all over the earth but god chose noah because noah was the only one that could be quicker and hallelujah to manifest rain why did the rain come because noah stayed with his message that's the only reason why the rain came because he was quickened to believe in what god said holy nobody else could do it hallelujah and you know i believe the prophet said that there were other boats in that day hollywood but noah was the only one that could understand what god was really calling for he was calling for a life that could be judgment proof hallelujah and you know look noah was made alive he was given the grace of god just so he could preach it's gonna rain he'd have to take another text it's gonna rain his children back up he says hey didn't i tell y'all it's gonna rain white bears say no we're gonna have a date night he said honey it's gonna rain we'll go to olive garden some other time but right now it's gonna rain hallelujah the teacher's calling from school and he said son daughter it's going to rain holy people acting up in church it's going to rain and he stayed with that message why he was going to manifest something where did the rain come from it came from noah's belief wow god would have never let it rain if noah didn't believe god so why did it came why did the rain come because noah believed and it'll be the same thing in your game where is this rapture coming from from your faith where's the body change coming from from what you believe hallelujah he said no it manifests the promise of that our will it fell upon jesus it manifests the promise of that hour what was the promise for his hour or resurrection jesus came he was quickened hallelujah just stripped satan from all his power but look how he had to go through he had to be whipped he had to be rejected by the people he loved he had to be talked about hashtag all kind of stuff earlier but that was the only way he could manifest hallelujah the promise of god in his day hallelujah for his hour his calling remember hallelujah he even said lord if it be possible please let this cup pass for me but god put something in him hallelujah that he cast down reasoning and he said lord nevertheless not that will thy will be done he was quickened to manifest resurrection power for that day and then the scripture comes and says if that same spirit that deals that that that that raised jesus up from the dead dwells in you will do the same thing so in our day we have a message of resurrection power but we got a prophet hallelujah listen church i want you to catch this we had a prophet that manifests a message in our day hallelujah to tell us hallelujah we got everything that all the mother churches had we got faith we got sanctification we got gifts and we're going to make a rapture happen what does that sound like brother jason don't that sound like a super church huh dude that sounds like a super church see we're looking at it as oh oh manifestations of natural things no it's a manifestation of a life that's what make it super remember he called jesus the super son why was he a super son by his life remember he could easily cast satan down but he said it is written and he just lived in front of him hallelujah oh my he said manifest the promise of the hour when it fell upon jesus manifest the promise of that hour 88 he says it's the holy spirit coming down to quicken make alive those people that's for ordained of god to be in the rapture the sole reason why a prophet came it's because of us he had to send a word hallelujah that would quicken us so we could take our rightful spot in god's mind god didn't see any of us lost hallelujah if he for ordained us to be with him sitting in heaven he had to send a word that could wake us up wow that's why that's why i don't get into all those debates of you know the prophet he made mistakes and didn't get a bear and all that stuff and i'm gonna be honest i'm gonna be honest i'm gonna be very very transparent right now you know did he get a beard to go to india and all the stuff look i'm gonna say this as nice as i can as simple as i can i don't care what the bear got to do with me what a trip that india got to do with me his whole job was to introduce jesus hallelujah now if you got jesus you got the earnest who cares about a bear who cares about a trip to india jamaica or wherever else they say he supposed to go who cares about some old dirty rotten plane sitting up in the mountains who cares it was all about the meeting with you in christ and that prophet hallelujah the word quickened you enough to be able to see christ in your day his job is done with you [Applause] i ain't looking for him to do nothing else because it wouldn't be scriptural his whole purpose was to come and turn my heart back to the faith of the fathers now you go every time elijah the spirit of elijah came there was a turning point every time he came there was a turning hallelujah remember when elijah was standing there hallelujah with the prophets of baal hallelujah he said lord so that their hearts may be turned back let the fire come hallelujah every time god comes and identifies himself by fire in your heart he's burning out everything else that you don't need you know it's it's church let's grow up this ain't the time to be debating whether brother brennan was a prophet or not it's done it's over if you heard a word holy that quickened you that gave you life they had to be a prophet right hallelujah because the word of god comes to a prophet first then up did that same word of god comes to the believer hallelujah so it's not the prophet coming to you is god coming to you amen and that's what they doing that's what the devil does the devil always wants to put it on flesh you know brother branham said brother brown brother brother branham and you know what's so special about us besides maybe some some of us harley but jason's kind of privileged he's been there in the tabernacle as a little boy right holly i ain't never been there to this day and being in jeffersonville everything just kept on i just ain't really had no big desire because those things don't excite me what excites me is that my name is written in heaven i've been to sabino kane going up the mountain to my who the anointing and all the stuff only thing i felt is heat and sweat i know one time i made this statement i was in jamaica i was saying you know listen that blah blah blah he the boy brother still say me too brother i've been to the cave all i got is a dirty shirt what's your expectation of this life that god has given you it ain't just for the relics of a prophet it's for that life remember what elisha said he said i want a double portion of your spirit i don't want i don't want just the miracles you did the relics of your life he said i want that god you got amen and you know what we get to heaven you know what me and brother brother go fellowship about our god i ain't gonna talk to him about like the caribou and all these things i'm talking to brother biscuit about that what's the attraction on the mountain i told the brother brady about that but when we get on the other side we're going to talk about what he did for us we're going to talk about what it means to be redeemed i am redeemed by all with the pride jesus hey man we gonna be up there talking about squirrels we're gonna be talking about only when you shot the lion and all no we're gonna be talking about that quickening power that got us here and i know some people get offended because you take it away from the private no i ain't right but jason you know what i say i say if the prophet was here some of these these radical believers they out quote him with his own quotes he comes well brother i didn't i didn't mean it like that was what i mean no but you said over here on this page that's what's going on right now we show people direct quotes of the prophets showing what they believe is wrong and they still won't receive it you know why because they're born to manifest another life but like i say kiara when i be at the gym if somebody ain't working out like they're supposed to i say coach i'm just minding my business i'm gonna keep on working out i'm just minding my business if you won't teach yourself you go ahead and cheat yourself but i ain't cheating myself i came here to sweat hallelujah like one of my one one of one of my friends in there a female hallelujah she be working out hallelujah she take a picture hallelujah and i like this little slogan huh it may be kind of congo but i like it she take the picture all of us be all sweaty and everything's taking picture and she put on the caption sweat like a pig but look like a fox oh yeah cause there's something you're gaining by all the things you're going through i know some of that somebody i know that through some of y'all for a loop hallelujah oh my let me keep reading what time we got with tommy oh my where we at where we at no i'm looking for the time it was o'clock ready that's one of the hidden clouds right here i don't know what kind of clock this is one of the mystery clocks okay all right all right listen um you didn't give me 92. listen he says but he that understand that he have known his place in this hour if you got understanding you know your place in this hour there's nothing that any of these unbelievers can say hello that will take you off your stand holy because why it's a personal experience and that's what people have been lacking holly they've been lacking a personal experience so they want to blame it on the preacher they want to bring on brother bradley he preached he had a hole in his shirt all kind of stuff and about the bridge and who cares about a bridge i thought some of y'all looking at me like bro really the prophet said that but notice i'm not making light of those things but you think i'm gonna base my salvation on whether a bridge fell or not huh hey base my salvation on that i'll base my salvation on the grave being empty right amen hallelujah holy hold my church and and i'm i'm gonna blow y'all away right quick i know a brother i ain't gonna call this thing i know a brother who said his sister was a nurse to an elderly lady up in jeff and she was like her 90s or whatever and she asked this elderly lady did that ever happen and she says yeah baby that happened back in the day and this brother preached that all over the world and now he say he don't believe it that's why you can't base your salvation on things you heard it has to be a god-given understanding because somebody built the bridge and somebody can tear the bridge down but if nobody gave you this christ nobody can take this christ boy bro jakes i know some people didn't cut me off online we'll see how they end up oh my church i'm just surrealist amen hallelujah this he said but he that that he knoweth and i'm not making light of the things in the prophet's life i believe holy all the things that he say happened happen i'm not here to reason any of that i'm here to put the silence hallelujah those who try to make me believe is not amen and that's why i say i don't care what you got to say about it hallelujah because i'm not basing my salvation on any of that i'm basing my salvation on what that word the prophet did preach did in my life amen can i get an amen church that's what we're living by because you remember when he went beyond the curtain of time he said i preached what paul preached and everybody said we're resting on that right he didn't say i gave a vision hill or caribou or bear and all these things he said no i preach what paul preached and if paul group is here my group gonna be here how it's a revelation [Applause] i'm sorry y'all i'm trying to quit but i love a church that can pull hallelujah listen he says he that heareth my word and believe on him that sent me present tense eternal life shall not come into the judgment but has already passed from death unto life then when this new eternal life dwells in you somebody say amen it is the potential or the earnest hallelujah of you being quickened from mortal to immortality [Applause] whoa the holy ghost is my earnest now you know what earnest money is when you're going to buy a house or a piece of property to show them people you serious they say put up a certain percentage now if you back out this deal you're gonna get this money back so when you put that up you're showing them that this contract i mean business holly and i'm gonna give you some earnest to show you that i'm serious i'm gonna give you some earnest that holds my feet to the fire holy and the holy ghost is our earnest hallelujah jesus gave us the earnings showing that we got a spot in heaven it's a part of the contract he was serious about you he said the holy ghost hallelujah is the earliest of you being quickened from mortal to immortality now i'm here to shock you because i got the holy ghost that means i already got a body change i thought some of y'all was going to rejoice you mean i'm the only one who got a little ache or a little pain in his body holy but my holy ghost overrides that remember he said if you want a acorn hell yeah he said he said you want a oak tree you get your acorn oh my it what is it it's the earnest it's the potential of what's going to take place oh my listen drop down to 98 gideon he says notice now this is what i want to show you how we're going to get there by the grace of god it's quicker to manifest listen he said notice you are now on your way he's talking about when you get the holy spirit notice you are now on your way growing to the full resurrection hallelujah amen that's why what john preached about that tree was so powerful hallelujah it looked like hallelujah that the tree is not growing but it's growing it's growing through the wet season it's going through the dry season he's even growing with scars in his life hallelujah he says no tree just comes up overnight it's got to grow as we grow hallelujah as we grow in the grace and knowledge of god hallelujah listen church we're growing in grace and knowledge of god what is grace god is continually giving us more and more unmerited favor [Music] as i live i'm getting more and more favored the more i mess up the more grace god's given me let me help you out let me help you out hurry up some of us have messed up today but we're growing in grace think about that growing in grace every time you mess up you get more grace hallelujah oh my god in grayson and knowledge hallelujah so you mess up god give you more grace and did he show you what you messed up on you messed up again again you mow grace did he show you what you messed up all he had messed up against the emo grace growing in grace and knowledge see satan's so dumb he thinking lord let me mess up this let me mess up that god said go ahead i'm gonna give him more grace because that's grace that's gonna give him more knowledge oh my i'm trying y'all you know you just can't just bring a 747 straight down jew helicopter number 747 take me a little time cause i come down everybody's gonna get shook up we gotta take out that to know how to set that tail end down first then you just let that front end come down you know a good pilot if you're sleeping on the plane he can put you on the ground and you think he's still in the air i love to come to church hallelujah brother brad and they dismiss church and i still feel like i'm in the air hallelujah i still feel like we're up there 30 000 feet high jesus christ the holy ghost is the best pilot i've ever seen holy i'm gonna leave him driving up 95 and still feel like i'm on the pulpit why it's the grace of god oh my god man he said baptizing to the holy spirit now the pentecostal church i want to read all that amen listen what god is doing he's putting everything in position holly there's a quote but maybe brother jason can get it for you but he said the message of this hour has been positionally placing us he's been putting us in position why to manifest the word for our day yeah holy you're like oh brother d my life is so tore up i've got so many problems i've i've done drugs i've done this i've done that but you're still here what is that grace think about it through all that messed up through all that stuff now you sitting here hearing a raw word you're hearing something that can quicken you through all your trials through all your mistakes the devil may have told you you're going to turn out to be nothing god said uh i see you sitting in church hallelujah hallelujah oh my let me come on down listen i want to kiss the back end of this quote and i'm gonna close no i'm gonna read the whole quote i'm gonna close listen this is uh adoption 1960. he said inside of that was the attributes which meant that he was inside of his great lli elohim was the attribute of or you know what an attribute is or let me say it like this was a nature think about that church if we um now this this ain't no skin milk now this vitamin d is real milk you got a weak stomach you're gonna make it bubble listen he said that his attributes are the nature of god so if we are his attributes who are we we are his very own nature that's why when you go back and you read about hallelujah the virtues he said if these things be in you and abound you will never fail that's why i called it a silly hallelujah hallelujah oh my why it's the nature of god show me in the bible where god's nature ever failed you know they came up they came up to god they looked like they had accusation against him they said we caught this woman in adultery she was an adultery no she was in it this and that jesus just kept writing see his nature wasn't too accused but his nature was to always find grace and even more grace she did it yes she did it but he wasn't going to get those accusers of satisfaction he said daughter where are your accusers first let's deal with them he said if you be if any of you be without sin and you know some of them were some big boys in church now there was some big boys and they came to jesus you know they probably had on their phylacteries you know there's there was sadducees and pharisees they sitting there talking to jesus you know the woman we caught her she did it i saw it she did it but what i hate about those kind of spirits they single people out why didn't they bring the man too i hate these single out spirits i always want to do believe one story god know the truth oh my i'm sorry y'all don't blame me blame the pool holiday i still see if you sitting at home watching it it's not the same effect ain't nothing like being here hearing this loud black preacher sweating ringing in your ears ain't nothing like it see what you don't see on the internet is that everybody in this room feel the same way i feel like [Applause] you don't feel that charge hallelujah the only difference is they build that hole in theirs back than i am hallelujah they feel the same way hallelujah but if they could they cut loose and we turn over some chairs in here you ain't gonna feel that on the internet can i get a witness now if you got this if you you know if you can't get here you got to stay home i ain't talking about you i'm talking about you people who just say well just another wednesday night think honey think we're going to stay home the power of decision what if jesus said that you were using me well no you didn't come with it so i think i'm going to stay home my church our example is in the scripture when those disciples got together on one accord god had no choice but to come down and that's always been his way when the people get on the same accord god has to pay attention because they got the power to make something happen you go to genesis chapter 11 where they're building the tower of babel hallelujah the bible says god came to take notice of what they was doing he said look the people have become one and there's nothing that they won't be able to do now he said so i got to stop this what were they gonna do they're gonna build a tower up to heaven he had to stop it and confound their languages because we can do it when we get together if we come here prayed up on the same accord we'll see the supernatural every time in one place the prophet of god say if we get on the same accord he said everybody be here from sickness within the next five minutes they made this good quotes to me i believe that because i believe we get on the same accord hallelujah hey man we can pray things into one another's life and it'll happen like that honey we can pray against financial depression huh we can pray against natural depression we can pray against all these other demon powers that try to upset us we can pray against stress and anxiety holy and believe us and god will hear our prayer why because if that spirit that raised up christ from the dead dwells in you it will also quicken your mortal body [Applause] joshua wasn't no different from you he just believed in the promise god told him nothing to be able to stand before you not even the son of the moon oh my listen well he said uh you know what an attribute is or let me say it like this was a nature this so little fellow will get it he said oh my he said so the little fellas again all you young people you babies this is plain enough for you to say i'm a child of god who are you talking to i'm a little baby jesus he says that's so the little fellows can get it and i'm one of the little fellas that has to get it that way inside of him was the nature to be a father but he's self-existent there ain't nothing for him to be a father by and now down inside that was something else that he was god and god is an object of worship oh my if he's an object of worship why is it so hard for us to worship when we come here that's the whole reason why we call him god we come here to worship hollywood it ain't just a song leader's job to sing songs it's your job to worship or not you need to come here saying i'm the song leader whatever he's saying i'm going to take over i'm going to say everybody bro jason i hate to say it i haven't been in some churches and they didn't provoke me to worship they sing a song about how great is our god and then they like this hungry he's our god sing with me i'm like y'all can't be single by the same god i know name above all names worthy of praise my heart will say how great is our god and don't get me started with we make a miracle worker promise keeper light in the darkness my god that is who you are [Music] don't get me started you think you're going to sing songs like that and i'm going to sit in there and bite my nails and look down at the float i had cancer he's a wifemaker [Applause] diabetes not once but twice he's a miracle worker [Applause] that song start off saying you are here wow what is it church it's a promise to us wherever two or three believers are there will i also be in the midst he said he was god and god is an object of worship but he was self-existent eli ella elohim so there was nothing to worship him inside of that he was a savior and there was nothing lost to be saved see inside of that he was a healer but there was nothing sick to be healed or nothing nothing to be sick now do you get the picture somebody say man do you get the picture all these things were out of place because god's nature was calling for that so sickness hallelujah projected him to be a healer so he had to turn it loose oh my he said so his attributes his nature produce what is today wow the nature of god produce what we have right now the nature of god produce homosexuality running wow why because he is a deliverer his nature produced a covet ebola aids all these things why because he's a healer but where is he doing the healing through you because he said if you lay hands on anything it'll be healed catch it catch how simple that is he said just lay hands on him say pray the anointing in your life should be that the demons recognize who you are you know many times when jesus stepped in the room the demons recognized who he was he said shut up don't say nothing don't tell nobody who i am be quiet he didn't even have to pray and have to do nothing he said shut up be quiet and then demons say we know who thou are thou art the holy one of israel shut up don't tell nobody i got something to do in here be quiet i'm looking for faith listen so the holy spirit is the earnest potential of our resurrection somebody say hey man what is potential potential is something in a baby stage but it's gonna come into something get in give me the first clip i'm about to close don't get nervous i want y'all to watch this and listen carefully the video yeah the video listen carefully turn it up bro potentially you press the button again keep getting kidding okay oh they'll make

so adorable okay that's good you know what that is that's a lion cub you know i was in africa them cubs like that they you go to the safari they let you play with them they let you pet them you can even put your finger in their mouth it's a lion but that's the baby stage that's the baby state it don't look powerful it don't look like king of the beast it just looked like a little look meow you heard they were laughing they were laughing at us is that it and a man crack a joke and he said it'll turn into a crowd later they're making fun of a lion and that's how the devil like to try to bluff us he come and say reducing we that and he don't really realize that we are gods we are children of the most high god all that is in him is in us in that baby stage hallelujah that lion will learn how to hunt he'll learn how to growl where his ground will go over five miles when it growls hallelujah give me the next clip next video now potential let me show you the real thing turn it back up turn the music back up i want you to hit us you see anybody playing with that you see anybody getting out of that car you see anybody say it's so cute that's that very cub in his full mature stage hallelujah all that it was in that baby stage is what it is right there and you just look at the intimidation nobody's getting out their car nobody's even talking or cracking jokes why because they see a real lion they see a mature king of the beast and you in your position that's what the devil sees he sees a real mature son and daughter of god who knows who they are and he dare to make jokes

ourself get past ourself and realize that if anything the devil can do he'll use your own complex and your own uh mental uh you know attack you in your mind and get you to believe a lie he'll do anything he can to keep you out of church because like brother diggs said he doesn't want you in this atmosphere doesn't want your kids in this atmosphere amen he wants you at home streaming no
