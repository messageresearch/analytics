========================================

Wednesday night um on the gene of God that's part two and uh turn it on then it'll work hopefully yes it will so we're going to be looking at the nature of man's life its source as well as immortality and the injection of death and destruction we want to relate all that back to election and the genetics of the human race from the Garden of Eden all the way to the New Jerusalem we won't do that today all that today in Sunday School but that's our purpose in this topic and First John 3 7-9 we want to read little children let no man deceive you he that doeth righteousness is righteous even as he is righteous he that committeth sin is of the devil for the devil's sins from the beginning for this purpose the Son of God was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin for his seed remadeth in him and he cannot sin because he is born of God may the Lord have the blessing to the reading of his word you can be seated and so this is look this scripture is looking at the the the fruit of the life that is behind the seed so if John is saying if you're living a righteous life then that manifests that you're born of God if you're if you're committing sin that means it's manifesting here from the Devil and you could say well we all sin and and fall short of the glory of God absolutely that is correct but we're looking at the end fruit result of confrontation with the manifested word for your day right sin is unbelief smoking cigarettes is not sin brother Branham always says that and people get so offended wearing pants on a woman cutting your hair all that is not sin it's simply the attributes of sin the Holy Spirit comes to condemn the world why do they why does he condemn the world because they smoke and drink no the holy spirit will come and condemn the world because they don't believe in Jesus Christ in other words they don't have faith that's what the condemnation is that's what the unforgivable sin is Abiding and unbelief and so he that commits sin he that unbelieves is of the devil whoever is born of God does not commit sin whoever's born of God believes doesn't mean that we don't commit sins doesn't mean we don't do things that we need to repent of scripture is very clear that until we get a new body and our immortality we're going to have sin that we need to make right that we need to repent of that's not the issue that this verse is speaking of this verse is telling us you you don't believe you don't disbelieve the word when you're born of God when you come out you're birthed out from God when the word comes to you you believe it you receive it that's the end result that's what God created us to be but there's a whole lot on the in between Genesis 2 16 and 17 says and the Lord God commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden now may is freely eat but of the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof Thou shalt surely die that's the condemnation that that is the Judgment of God if you eat of this tree you'll die and if we see the confrontation of Eve and the serpent what is her Original Sin while we said we are many times we say it's sex well in in a way the reality is it started with unbelief she heard the word twisted and she accepted the word twisted her faith connected with the wrong word and because of that through the whole human race into sin brought forth in in her mind first it was conceived in her sin was conceived in her mind then it was conceived in her womb right and so so that's the judgment Adam was created and Eve was created immortal they were only subject to death if they ate of the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil and God does not say the punishment for sin is eternal conscious torment in a burning Hill it says it's death death means ceasing to exist all right so they ate of the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil this resulted in inherited death inherited sin nature for the human race Romans 5 12. I'm going quick if you're here on Wednesday night you know why I'm going quick because this is all review wherefore as by one man's sin entered into the world and death by sin and so death passed upon all men for that all have sinned so this is we get the same punishment as Adam because he was the head of the human race so we receive what he receives thank God he was replaced there was a second man the Lord From Heaven and we in him we receive life and we went over these words the two words we talked about ion and Ionia and we're going to look at every time we looked every time ion was used we're not going to look at every time again we're going to look at a few just to demonstrate if you see the definition there ion sometimes it's translated Eternal sometimes age sometimes World sometimes a Messianic period translated many different ways you see the heading there is the word Eternal the same as Immortal well in English yes but looking at the Greek when we when we look at the Greek we can't take ion and make it be eternal across the board here's what we would do here Colossians 1 26 even the mystery which has been hid from eternity and from Generations but now is made manifest to this two of saints again it doesn't make sense hid from ages that's that's correct second Timothy 4 10 for Demas has forsaken me having loved this present eternity again this is this the word ion is used in conjunction with a word that signifies time present tense so this present age or this present world First Corinthians 2 7 but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before eternity unto our Glory again doesn't make sense there's no before eternity The Eternity has no beginning and no ending but this word ion is used in conjunction again with beef the term before connection to time it's speaking of an age or a period of time here's another word that's translated as Eternal ionios closely connected the other one and you see in the Thayer definition this is why I say we have to know our Bible and know the revelation of this message otherwise if you look at the these definitions you'll take it as an absolute the definitions are not the absolute the Bible is and so the Bible will if we study it closely will help us Define itself but usually with the hard-headedness of man it takes God sending a message to correct us but by the Holy Spirit we can compare Genesis to Revelation and that message that we can come to the right Revelation and understanding so here he says without beginning and at end Without End never to cease so the common ways that we use eternal once again failure from the dictionary Romans 16 25 now to him that is a power to establish you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ according to the revelation of the mystery which was Kept Secret since eternity began doesn't work since the world began or since the ages began even as Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities about them enlightened manner giving themselves over to fornication going after string strange flesh are set forth for an example suffering the Vengeance of Eternal fire how long did this eternal last foreign it was very quick it it destroyed everything it burnt up and it was done very quickly so that's not a very long eternity right there but the fire is what's Eternal because it's coming from an eternal God but we're not looking at a a verse that's speaking of torment never-ending torment the time period was quick the source of the fire is eternal so we looked at this before we mentioned this the two words in the Greek that are translated as Eternal Everlasting or forever are words that have a varied meaning depending on the context it is used in if used in conjunction with God or life it speaks of the quality of the Almighty which is that he never had a beginning and never had an ending but if it's used in conjunction with punishment or a dispensation it's meaning varies depending on that it speaks of a period of time so again it's you have to see the the context and then the larger context as we looked at before it says the the the the wicked will go into Everlasting or eternal punishment right so we can't just take that verse isolated against the rest of scripture and then come up with a conclusion that makes us reinterpret the whole Bible so in other words you're you have to look at it systematically from Genesis to Revelation to see if what what is this subject first we look in other words first we look at the sentence that it's used in next we look at the book that it's used in after that we looked at it in the realm of what is this Doctrine from Genesis to revelation and how is it developed and how does how is God unfolding it through that otherwise we'll come to a we can come to all kinds of conclusions and people do come to all kinds of conclusions but if we take this General principle and look at it look at its context we can come to a correct revelation so let's look at the verses that are supposedly telling us that there's an eternal hell again our English definition of Eternal that brother Branham gave us shows that hell itself cannot be an unceasing torment Mark 9 43 and 44 and If thy hand offend thee cut it off it is better for thee to enter into life maimed than having uh two hands to go into hell into the fire that never shall be quenched where their worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched oh now we're in trouble remember though the worm and fire don't die never said anything about the person that said into it so again we we have to we have to watch that well why would it make any sense if we're saying that the if the person's cast in there and the worm doesn't die and the fire does not quench what does it mean well first of all what does it mean a worm so when people are sent into hell they're going to be covered with fire and worms you know we have to again this is this is actually a quote of the Old Testament if you're not familiar with it let's look at it Isaiah 66. and they shall go forth and look upon the carcasses of the men that have transgressed against me for their worms shall not die neither shall their fire be quenched and they shall be in a horrible abhoring unto all flesh so it's speaking of the time of God's judgment at the at the end of the tribulation period if you look at Isaiah 66 God is judging the people for what they've done against his word and so the bigger picture is people are alive still going out and looking at what's happening so they've looked and see what's happened as an aft this is like the aftermath of Armageddon you could say and the judgments that fall so now the the aftermath is there's going to be bodies laying around Jerusalem dead burning with worms eating them up that's what your eternity is going to be like in the new Heaven and new earth there's going to be bodies laying around that are getting eaten by worms and on fire how does it make sense it doesn't make sense the worm dies not the Fire doesn't die same thing as Eternal fire how long did the Eternal fire burn long enough to destroy what was necessary this is the context of scripture Matthew 10 28. and fear not them which kill the body but are not able to kill the soul but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and Body in hell so if if to kill is to deprive the body of life then hell would seem to be the Declaration of both physical and spiritual life in other words the ultimate purpose of hell is the extinction of being if hell is death and hell are cast into the Lake of Fire this is the second death what is death what is death here when our family passes away we understand the spiritual aspect of it but for us as far as we're concerned death is a cessation of life in this Dimension let's just put it that way they don't live here in this Dimension anymore life has ceased so if there's a second death that is killing the soul so are are we suggesting that God is eternally killing the soul that doesn't make sense at all there's no logic to that killing the soul means the soul is going to go out of existence and God is able to do that we can kill a body only God can kill a soul and another another point is some people they don't understand Soul Spirit body the man has three different parts right well to them they say soul means the whole person the whole being and in some cases it can mean it but in this case why are we separating soul and Body in other words God is God in this verse there's a separation between the in inanimate part the spiritual part of man and the physical part of man so we can kill the physical part only God can kill the spiritual part right so that's what's going to happen that that's what hell does that's the ultimate thing that the Lake of Fire will do is deprive your soul of life brother Branham says he'll die he'll go into a lake of fire and brimstone which burns where burning is going on forever and ever and maybe for a hundred million years his soul may be tormented in a lake of fire and brimstone you say will it just be like regular Brimstone I believe it'll be a million times worse than that I believe you couldn't describe it by fire by a literal fire the only reason it's put by fire that fire is the most consuming thing that we have we we had it absolutely consumes and destroys everything fire does so you see it's perfectly expression that's the reason why fire is used is because it destroys everything so when you see fire it means it's taking something out of existence First Corinthians 1 18 for the preaching of the Cross is to them that perish foolishness but to un unto us which are saved it is the power of God so you see that there's people that are perishing and we're on we were on that road too but someone saved us the power of God comes and saves us out of perishing second Corinthians 2 15 for we are unto God a sweet saver of Christ in them that are saved and in them that perish so here we have again saved and perishing second Thessalonians 2 10 and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish because they receive not the love of the truth that they might be saved once again same picture some are saved and some are some perish for the wages of sin Romans 6 23 the wages of sin is eternal conscious punishment in hell oh for the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ Our Lord eternal life is a gift it's not what we deserve though we're predestinated to it and we understand the picture behind it that if you have eternal life you always had eternal life but you are in God as one of his thoughts or one of his attributes and then your birth forth but it's not what we deserve we deserve to perish Matthew 7 13 enter ye in at the Straight Gate for wide is the gate and Broad is the way that leads to destruction and many there be which go in there at so we have perishing death and destruction so if hell is eternal then those that perish never perish those who are destroyed are never destroyed and those that die never die how does it mix how does it make any sense at all Revelation 2014 we referred to it before in death in hell were cast into the Lake of Fire this is the second death it's very clear death is a cessation of life they're cast into the Lake of Fire as brother Brandon said they may burn for millions and billions of years I believe that just as we Christians we get a reward based on our works unbelievers will get a reward based on their works if you're Hitler or you're the devil or you're well I won't say any contemporary names but if you're some corrupt politician that's responsible for Millions and millions of death you will receive a just reward you will burn for the time that God has allotted for you and someone that hasn't done that is not going to burn that as long you see what I'm saying it's a judgment of reward so first death physical life is done second death spiritual life is destroyed it's annihilated it goes out of existence Revelation 20 verse 10. and the devil let me get forward here and the devil that deceived them cast was cast into the lake of fired Brimstone where the Beast and the false prophet are and shall be tormented day and night forever and ever again after studying ion it's just it's doubled up the word ion it means a long period of time and again the Beast is not an individual it's an actual it's it's an Empire right it's the it's the political portion of Rome so you know here we have a picture there's I guess there's a spirit behind every Empire lots of spirits behind every Empire and so though all those Beast spirits that are connected to Rome are sent in to this place for the judgment is eternal right the punishment is eternal it means it's not going to change the torment is not eternal it comes to an end Malachi 4 1 for behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven and all the proud ye and all that do wickedly shall be stubble in the day that cometh shall burn them up saith the Lord of hosts that it shall leave them neither root nor Branch you say well that's the the day of the Lord that's right at the end of the tribulation period or it's the tribulation period that's going to do that but the picture is the wicked are going there's nothing going to be nothing left of the wicked right and so yes Conte in based on the context is this is speaking of the day of the Lord and that's when they're going to be destroyed and the righteous will walk out on the ashes of the wicked yes and you could probably see how that's connected to Isaiah 66 that we looked at previously where they'll will go out and see where the fire is not quenched and where the worm is not destroyed see that's that's connected there but this is bringing us to the ultimate end of the wicked which is nothing's left to them brother Brandon says I don't believe the Bible teaches an eternal burning hell it doesn't because if hell is eternal and people that go there will be punished eternally the only one the way they could be eternally punished they'd have to have eternal life there's only one form of eternal life and that's in God see so they have to come to Annihilation that is their physical part becomes annihilated and then their spiritual part becomes annihilated that's completely consumed there's no more to it neither root nor Branch the Bible calls it they're completely done away and if this is Exodus 21 let's look at a principle here God's principle 23-25 and if any Mischief follow then thou shall give Life For Life eye for eye tooth for tooth hand for hand foot for foot burning for burning wound for wound stripe for stripe now this this is a point that I remember when I first got saved spending so much time reading Jonathan Edwards and and the logic behind his understanding and he goes into great detail to demonstrate why man deserves Eternal punishment not just Eternal punishment eternal torment because they say well God has is is an infinite God he's infinitely holy you have offended an infinite God so your punishment therefore should be infinite it's an interesting logic but it isn't based on scripture it's based on philosophy I love Jonathan Edwards I'm not here to put anything down on him it was the age that he was living in that that that man's Spirit age and it wasn't these things weren't to be restored then but the point being that I'm trying to bring out as many say that today still say that today and use that same logic today but really does it fit is a crime committed in time worthy of Eternal conscious punishment you've committed a crime yes it's horrible yes it's a bad thing but is God going to punish you for all is that the character of God to punish for all eternity or is it the character of God to reward you according to your works if you're if you're not covered by the blood he's going to judge you and judge you fairly God would be meeting out a punishment that was not in line with his own Divine Justice eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth and for hand he promised in the beginning death he did not promise to Adam when he came to Adam he didn't say the day you eat of this tree you're going to be punished in hell for all of eternity didn't say that why because there was a place for Redemption right for Adam but the punishment is death and its Ultimate Death Ezekiel 18 4 behold All Souls are mine as the soul of the father so also the soul of the son is mine the soul that sinneth it shall die so again just cut recovering the things we covered on Wednesday and tonight and close our tonight I I did have two coffees but started on my third maybe I needed that this morning immortality is not the default of every human being Now understand we we look at this in the big picture and you say well yeah for some people it is well just a minute just a minute what about the blood of Christ what about God working out his plan in time what we are worthy of is death and punishment for that sin we understand predestination we understand election that's God overriding this whole process we understand even further back than just the election and understand where our life source is but don't get it out of out of cater and think well I just this is what I deserve no you're promised death and you're deserving of the Lake of Fire that's not the default of every human being eternal life is a gift given and revealed through Jesus Christ only don't get it don't get predestination and election and eternal life crossed up in that way I'm not saying you're given eternal life the minute you're saved that's that's it's connected but it's separate hell is described using Darkness fire and destruction perishing death all of that is a picture of annihilation none of that is a picture of Eternal conscious torment people will be tormented but fire destroys completely not partially judgment is eternal fire is eternal but conscious torment is not those who are cast into hell will eventually be annihilated because they don't ultimately possess eternal life and God's judgment upon sin calls for death both physical and spiritual death so we're going to tie the rest of it together we're going to look into the rest of it as we go forward
