[9:16] this morning
[9:24] just take just a thought the spirit of
[9:27] the last days the spirit
[9:31] of the last days verse 3
[9:34] second timothy
[9:35] this know also that in the last days
[9:38] perilous times shall come
[9:41] for men shall be lovers of their own
[9:43] selves covetous boasters
[9:46] proud
[9:47] blasphemers
[9:49] disobedient to parents
[9:51] unthankful unholy
[9:54] without natural affection truce breakers
[9:57] false accusers incontinent
[10:00] fierce
[10:00] despisers of those that are good
[10:03] traitors heady high-minded
[10:06] lovers of pleasure more than lovers of
[10:09] god
[10:10] having a form of godliness
[10:13] but denying the power thereof
[10:16] from such turn away look to verse seven
[10:19] ever learning and never able to come to
[10:22] the knowledge of the truth you can be
[10:25] seated this morning
[10:27] we have a some slides here
[10:31] to make sure this um is working
[10:34] real fast just make sure this is
[10:37] on
[10:39] there we go good all right praise the
[10:41] lord that's a few little technical bugs
[10:44] but we got them worked down
[10:46] it's amazing when you look at the
[10:47] declaration of independence
[10:50] one of the phrases that you find inside
[10:52] of there thomas jefferson said is what
[10:55] the government is
[10:57] put in place to protect and that is
[11:01] life is one of them
[11:03] liberty is the second one and the third
[11:06] one is the pursuit
[11:08] of happiness it's amazing that they put
[11:10] that in there if you've ever looked at
[11:12] the declaration of independence and
[11:13] thought what were the crafters what did
[11:16] they have in their mind when they were
[11:18] pinning this that we have the right and
[11:21] in fact they call it
[11:22] the inalienable right
[11:25] of a u.s citizen to pursue life
[11:28] liberty and the pursuit of happiness and
[11:31] everyone is pursuing something they call
[11:34] it the american dream i was driving on
[11:36] ladies island and seeing a an old uh
[11:40] just uh just dilapidated as dilapidated
[11:43] as it could get a class a that's the
[11:46] motor coach that you would drive in you
[11:48] know like a big rv
[11:49] and man this thing was dilapidated
[11:52] rusted um
[11:53] you know the wheel wells were rusted you
[11:56] could see into the wheel wells from
[11:57] where the tire was that none of the
[11:59] tires this thing was massive probably 40
[12:01] feet long big and you could just as i
[12:04] was looking at that um that rv
[12:08] i thought man this thing's probably like
[12:09] a i would say like a 1985 model and out
[12:12] in these you know here's this man and
[12:14] this woman driving it i thought man
[12:16] probably and it's when that thing just
[12:18] came off the lot it was probably just
[12:20] nice and the paint job was new and you
[12:23] know they were the envy of everybody as
[12:25] they drive it now they're the
[12:27] laughingstock of everybody because the
[12:30] thing is just rusted to pieces it's
[12:32] dilapidated it's falling apart
[12:35] and and as i look as it goes by me i'm
[12:37] just these thoughts are running through
[12:38] my mind thinking man that thing was
[12:40] probably so nice when they first bought
[12:42] it probably you know nowadays a rv like
[12:45] that cost a hundred thousand dollars
[12:48] just to drive something like that
[12:50] and and then looking at the condition
[12:52] that it is now the glass was broke and
[12:54] you could see where the tent had started
[12:56] to scrape off i mean it was still it
[12:57] still wasn't wasn't uh un you know
[13:00] unusable but it was quite a far stretch
[13:02] away from what it was when it when it's
[13:05] glory days
[13:06] and it was incredible because as it went
[13:08] by me the black smoke just puffing out
[13:10] of the back of it and i looked on the
[13:12] side and you could make out the writing
[13:14] that was there that was sort of faded
[13:17] and was missing letters and the writing
[13:18] was the american dream
[13:25] and i thought my goodness what a what a
[13:27] stereotype of what a what a true emblem
[13:31] of the american dream and here this
[13:34] thing wrote right on the side of it the
[13:36] american dream and it had it had uh it
[13:39] had fallen far from grace
[13:42] it had fallen far from what it once was
[13:45] and that's what they call this is the
[13:47] the life
[13:48] lib to to have life to have liberty
[13:51] according to the crafters
[13:54] it's our inalienable right life
[13:57] liberty and the pursuit
[13:59] of happiness
[14:01] and so you begin with and it's a it's
[14:04] like a uh you would call it a just a
[14:07] vocation that you're given
[14:09] by by the the founders of the nation
[14:13] that that's your pursuit i mean that
[14:15] that's your that's your right is to
[14:17] pursue
[14:18] happiness and everyone is pursuing
[14:21] something you know you're you're today
[14:23] you're pursuing you're in pursuit of
[14:25] something all of us in this world uh you
[14:28] know today as i was pursuing something
[14:30] and i believe it's important
[14:32] that we know what we're pursuing i think
[14:34] that's a good question sometimes to ask
[14:36] us just here in sunday school something
[14:38] very simple
[14:40] what are we trying to
[14:43] that's obtain what is it that we're
[14:45] after
[14:46] what is it that we're
[14:48] pursuing
[14:50] what is it that we're chasing the
[14:52] world's
[14:53] chaste
[14:54] liberty they've chased life
[14:57] all throughout american history that's
[14:59] what you find is this pursuit of it's
[15:02] always progress
[15:04] always trying to improve and and
[15:08] without denial things have improved
[15:10] technology has advanced in ways that we
[15:13] never would have thought possible never
[15:15] would have dreamed uh you know the
[15:18] technology that we have today that we
[15:20] could pull out of something a device in
[15:22] our pocket and and and be able to video
[15:25] chat with someone in another country and
[15:27] be able to converse just back and forth
[15:30] or on your watch you know you can
[15:32] be running down the road and talking to
[15:34] someone on your watch
[15:36] it's incredible what technology has done
[15:39] and the world has progressed but has it
[15:43] has it has it found the question i have
[15:45] this morning
[15:46] is has it found what it's looking for
[15:51] has it found what they've called the
[15:53] american dream what does that really
[15:55] mean to have the
[15:57] american dream
[15:59] you could tell by the name of the bus
[16:01] the motor coach it was
[16:03] it was a life that was
[16:05] free and had freedom and had liberty and
[16:08] kid and had riches and had excess and
[16:10] was successful that's what they look at
[16:13] they pursue so because of that the
[16:15] pursuit of money you have the per people
[16:18] are always chasing and they they're
[16:20] pursuing uh their entire life mission
[16:23] and life purpose is money money is a is
[16:26] a is a an idol that's worshipped
[16:29] in this in our in our country people are
[16:31] pursuing it constantly trying to chase
[16:34] riches always chasing the next big
[16:37] paycheck the next big
[16:39] opportunity
[16:42] and i'm trying to give you just an idea
[16:44] of the pace that america the the
[16:47] american dream i'm trying to give you
[16:49] the pace and the atmosphere that the
[16:51] world because we're told that you're
[16:54] you're too that your inalienable right
[16:55] is to have life liberty in the pursuit
[16:57] of happiness and we heard that so we
[17:00] chased it we're chasing happiness well
[17:02] money brings half money bangs
[17:03] possessions so that must produce
[17:05] happiness what a lie that's been told to
[17:08] many a movie star and actors and music
[17:10] stars who've died by suicide at 18 19 20
[17:14] years old because they got all the money
[17:17] in the world and they realize money
[17:19] doesn't bring happiness
[17:22] can you say amen
[17:25] some pursue money and they're always
[17:27] chasing that others pursue a bigger
[17:29] house a better car they're looking for
[17:31] status or some way to have an imagery
[17:35] that they give off and some of the most
[17:38] broke people in the world drive some of
[17:40] the nicest cars
[17:43] and live in some of the biggest houses
[17:46] because it's all about an image that
[17:48] you're as as it's the the cochlear ism
[17:51] as you know or you could say you know
[17:53] you're trying to keep up with the
[17:54] joneses or trying to keep up with this
[17:56] family and everyone's trying to keep up
[17:58] and trying to stay to make sure you're
[18:00] you know you don't have to be at the
[18:01] very top but just make sure you're not
[18:03] at the very bottom and it's all about an
[18:05] image
[18:07] some people are pursuing social
[18:09] acceptance
[18:11] in a higher class that's what they call
[18:13] when they say oh man you've i just want
[18:15] to make it i'm trying to make it i'm
[18:16] trying to make it i'm doing what i'm
[18:18] doing because i got to get out of here i
[18:20] got to make it what are they trying to
[18:21] make it to
[18:24] they're trying to make it to what people
[18:25] have defined
[18:27] defined in this shallow shell of what
[18:30] the american dream is
[18:34] so some people chase money some people
[18:37] chase
[18:38] status some people chase image
[18:41] and then you have other people who you
[18:43] have people who pursue money people who
[18:45] pursue
[18:46] image people who pursue status and then
[18:48] you have others
[18:49] who are pursuing they wake up every day
[18:52] chasing running laboring sweating
[18:54] but they don't really know what they're
[18:56] chasing
[18:58] they don't really know what they're
[18:59] pursuing
[19:01] they're just in this roundabout
[19:04] and what is it that they're trying to
[19:06] obtain the world is chasing
[19:08] life liberty and happiness
[19:11] and so
[19:12] now we ask this question here we are
[19:15] this many years
[19:16] past that inalienable right given to
[19:19] this nation
[19:21] and i ask have they found
[19:24] what they're looking for
[19:27] has the world here we are in the break
[19:29] of 2022
[19:31] man the age of progress and we ask
[19:34] ourself
[19:35] has the world found after all those
[19:38] years of pursuit have we found
[19:41] happiness
[19:44] is the nation is the world
[19:50] happy when you look on
[19:53] the news you see streets that are
[19:55] burning
[19:57] rioting
[19:58] protesting
[20:01] you see a two parties screaming at each
[20:03] other fighting
[20:05] you you see a world that's paralyzed
[20:09] by fear
[20:10] every single day
[20:13] a world that's that's
[20:15] uh that's oppressed by
[20:18] hatred and hate
[20:22] and and anger
[20:24] and malice if i was to take the
[20:26] barometer and i was to tell you the
[20:28] temperature
[20:29] of the world of the nation and it
[20:31] doesn't matter where you go and what
[20:32] part of the country you're in you're a
[20:34] little better in the south i'll say that
[20:36] but
[20:39] yeah it's a lot lot better weather
[20:42] but if you were to take the temperature
[20:44] you'd get this across the board
[20:47] that the real
[20:48] atmosphere
[20:50] of the nation is not happiness
[20:53] but it's
[20:54] malice and envy and jealousy and
[20:58] bitterness
[21:01] and it's constantly i want to just
[21:04] this is so simple i know but i thought
[21:06] it was just good for a sunday school
[21:08] it's constantly
[21:10] being fed through cycles and there's
[21:12] always been throughout the dawning of of
[21:15] of news media there's always been a new
[21:18] cycle
[21:19] but now we live in the age of
[21:21] information we live in the information
[21:25] age
[21:26] and with the click of a button just on
[21:29] your phone just in the click of a button
[21:31] you don't have to go down and spend 25
[21:33] cents anymore at a machine or 50 cents
[21:36] or a dollar 25 for the paper or get get
[21:39] and then go through the paper and and
[21:41] and be able to you know you don't even
[21:43] need a subscription service you don't
[21:44] need any of that you just with the click
[21:46] of a button
[21:48] with your out your phone on your
[21:50] computer on any device that you have
[21:53] we're in the world of the information
[21:55] age where everything is connected
[21:58] and and and and and with the click of a
[22:01] button with just the press of your
[22:03] finger
[22:04] you can ingest and consume
[22:08] gallons and gallons and gallons of
[22:10] hatred and fear
[22:13] and strife and anxiety and worry you
[22:16] don't have to go out and seek it just
[22:17] with the click of a button you don't
[22:18] even realize i don't think we realize
[22:21] sometimes how much of that we ingest
[22:26] how much of it that it affects us
[22:29] you know it's amazing because
[22:32] it's no accident we know that this is
[22:34] satan's eden
[22:36] and it's not just random we haven't just
[22:38] arrived
[22:40] at the information age you haven't just
[22:43] arrived here
[22:44] but it's there's a there's a design i
[22:46] want you to look beyond the surface this
[22:48] morning and understand that it's
[22:50] designed that way it's being controlled
[22:55] by an end-time spirit
[22:58] and that there's a movement happening
[23:01] and that movement has a leader it has a
[23:04] president
[23:07] and his name isn't joe biden
[23:10] but there's a leader
[23:12] there's a president
[23:14] to that movement
[23:16] he's greater than any
[23:18] president we've ever had he's greater
[23:20] than any pope the bible calls him the
[23:23] god
[23:24] are you listening
[23:26] the bible calls him the god of this evil
[23:29] age
[23:33] and he's
[23:34] a god
[23:35] because of his stat he gets god's status
[23:39] because he's worshiped
[23:41] by people
[23:44] it's and i want you to listen uh just
[23:45] listen real close what brother branham
[23:47] says here in investments
[23:49] he says now let's talk and bring it
[23:52] back home once you church members wants
[23:55] the same thing
[23:56] you want some preacher you women that
[23:58] will not condemn you for the way you
[24:01] dress and live
[24:03] somebody that'll pat you people on the
[24:05] back and tell you that you can do this
[24:08] that and the other and you can act like
[24:10] the world and live like the world and
[24:11] still maintain your confession of christ
[24:14] you're wanting those
[24:16] things you voted listen holly says this
[24:19] you're wanting those things you vote it
[24:21] you'll vote against a godly man out of
[24:24] your community to get a man like that in
[24:27] there
[24:29] it's the desire now remember and we i
[24:32] don't know how to
[24:33] uh to blank this maybe it's that good
[24:36] remember it was
[24:38] we've spoken this before ahab and
[24:40] jezebel
[24:41] evil king
[24:42] evil queen
[24:44] didn't just israel didn't just
[24:46] that wasn't just misfortune that they
[24:49] got an ahab and jezebel but ahab and
[24:51] jezebel was actually the reward for the
[24:55] desire of their heart it's what they
[24:57] were wanting so brother branham says you
[24:59] want a preacher who will not tell you
[25:00] how to live how to dress how to act you
[25:02] want somebody you'll vote them out
[25:05] to get somebody like that and he says
[25:07] it's the desire
[25:09] it's the spirit of the nation and then
[25:11] he says it's the spirit
[25:14] of the last days
[25:17] so there's a spirit of the last days we
[25:20] read about it in timothy and may i stop
[25:22] right here just a minute and say i
[25:24] believe that the people
[25:26] are in the preparation of the last great
[25:29] destruction this world will ever know
[25:33] i believe we're at the end you can speak
[25:35] to people you could put a billy graham
[25:37] in every city in the united states
[25:39] they'd drink whiskey and smoke
[25:41] cigarettes and laugh at you and
[25:43] everything else just the same
[25:45] they are in the spirit
[25:48] so what is he speaking of here this is
[25:50] an anointing
[25:51] this is a worship this is a spiritual
[25:54] something spiritually that they're
[25:57] participating in they don't even realize
[25:59] it
[26:00] but the he says they're in the spirit of
[26:03] the last days and notice this this is
[26:06] the prophet speaking here and god
[26:08] they're in the spirit of the last days
[26:10] and god cannot send destruction
[26:14] before the people are in the spirit for
[26:17] destruction
[26:20] another place he says you can't be
[26:21] healed until you get in the spirit of
[26:23] healing
[26:24] he says we can have a sp
[26:26] a healing service and he says but
[26:28] healing couldn't take place until you
[26:29] get in the anointing of the atmosphere
[26:31] of that that's why we have a worship
[26:33] service we can't really worship until
[26:35] we've entered into the spirit of worship
[26:38] and he says god can't send destruction
[26:41] until the people come under the spirit
[26:44] of destruction man i have to stop right
[26:46] there and say they are in the spirit of
[26:48] destruction
[26:49] you'll never see a an uh a group of of
[26:52] people
[26:53] that are more typified by destroying
[26:56] things than the age that you live in
[26:58] today
[26:59] and you say well they're burning the
[27:00] streets down and they're burning they're
[27:02] riding and building yeah that's one side
[27:04] of it the other side is get it on
[27:05] facebook and get it on social media and
[27:07] get it in their massive microphones and
[27:10] destroying and tearing down the other
[27:12] party
[27:14] it's all destruction brother branham
[27:16] says you could kill a man more than one
[27:17] way to stick a knife in his back speak
[27:19] against him speak against his character
[27:23] all right you with me
[27:25] he says they're in the spirit of the
[27:26] last days god never did destroy anything
[27:29] man always destroys himself
[27:32] so you have this constant you have a we
[27:35] live in the information age and as i
[27:38] said it's no accident
[27:40] you something you i don't think you even
[27:42] realize it to you this if you were to
[27:44] stop and transport yourself and travel
[27:46] back in time 30 years ago
[27:50] and you were to contrast it with today
[27:53] you would not believe
[27:56] you would not believe how distracted you
[27:59] are today
[28:00] not realizing it
[28:02] by um by a news
[28:04] media

[28:08] word media because it's not just always
[28:10] fox news sometimes it's instagram and
[28:12] facebook and snapchat
