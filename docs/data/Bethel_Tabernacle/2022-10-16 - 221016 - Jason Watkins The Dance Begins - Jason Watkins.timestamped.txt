[0:33] wonderful name. And the church says,
[0:35] "Amen."
[0:36] Amen. I want to greet a few guests um

[0:45] to just welcome Sister Evelyn. Amen.
[0:48] Nice to meet you. Amen. You're welcome.
[0:50] Amen. Amen. Also, Emily Curtis had a
[0:54] family here. Amen. And I believe they
[0:56] sing. Amen. So, we definitely have to
[0:59] see if we can get Sister Sally Duke and
[1:01] husband to give us a song. Amen.
[1:04] No husband. Okay. He gave me the look.
[1:08] Well, God bless you this morning. Amen.
[1:10] We're going to have Brother Jack if you
[1:11] come. Amen. And give our give your
[1:14] testimony. You may be seated. Amen.
[1:30] I ain't nervous. I'm tell you, it takes
[1:33] God to do what just happened to me.
[1:36] Brother Luther prayed two weeks ago. I
[1:38] was that brother that's fighting two
[1:40] devils, and I'm still fighting them.
[1:42] Y'all keep praying for me. This coming
[1:43] week, I'm going to be still fighting.
[1:45] This thing's coming once again.
[1:49] It's come again. Now, Sister Kathy was
[1:52] last year, Brother Jack had to take that
[1:54] sword and I I went out there. I went to
[1:57] Gangsville, Florida, and I come back
[1:59] after I come back and I fought even when
[2:01] I got home, I fought that devil. This
[2:04] thing was two-edged sword. And I'm tell
[2:05] you what, when you got that word in you,
[2:06] you don't have the word. You hear me?
[2:08] Because Satan, Satan's got no power over
[2:10] us. He ain't got nothing but a bow with
[2:12] no arrows. You hear me?
[2:15] Oh, anyway, I'm tell you, I God's been
[2:18] waking. I ain't been able to sleep
[2:20] hardly. I told sister Kathy I laid in
[2:22] the recliner last night before dark come
[2:25] and uh she took a picture. My mouth was
[2:28] open. I was sleeping like crazy. But
[2:30] then from from 8:00 or something like
[2:33] 7:30 to all night long I hadn't slept.
[2:37] God has been dealing with people. I
[2:40] ain't nobody hear me.
[2:41] Ain't nobody
[2:44] but I I didn't get no sleep last night.
[2:46] All I done is laid in my recliner. I'm
[2:48] like, "Brother Jason, men, brother Jason
[2:50] talked me driving that truck back that
[2:51] y'all going to see out there." The power
[2:53] of God come down on me and I was Brother
[2:56] Jason felt it. I don't know what
[2:57] something's happened, but Brother Jason
[2:58] felt it. And uh and I just uh give all
[3:03] the glory to God, but I had no sleep. I
[3:04] just closed my eyes and laid there and
[3:06] God talks to me. I ain't I ain't
[3:07] nothing. You hear me? I ain't nothing
[3:08] but God almighty. I me and Sister Kathy
[3:11] has dedicated our life fully to this
[3:12] message. This message this message is
[3:14] truth, people. Amen.
[3:16] I know where I'm going. You hear me?
[3:18] I could drop dead right now and it don't
[3:20] worry me one bit.
[3:22] That faith has dropped in this heart.
[3:24] You hear me?
[3:25] I ain't been with y'all very long, but I
[3:26] tell you what,
[3:27] this ain't brother Jack speaking there.
[3:29] Y'all never seen Brother Jack guest. You
[3:31] hear me?
[3:32] Y'all never seen him.
[3:35] Oh God.
[3:45] I wrote this down.
[3:48] When this started coming to pass,
[3:50] Brother Luther prayed that I was that
[3:53] brother them two demons I've been
[3:54] fighting. When this started coming to
[3:56] pass, he Christ came to me at 2:30 a.m.
[4:00] I might cry like a baby, but this is
[4:02] real.
[4:04] At 2:30 a.m., I woke up crying, talking
[4:07] to him, and then he led me to my
[4:10] recliner. And me and brother Jason
[4:12] corresponded with that. He said,
[4:13] "Brother Jack, when I sit in my
[4:15] recliner, he comes and talks with me."
[4:16] That's the same thing. I ain't no
[4:18] minister. And I told Brother Jason, he's
[4:20] found out, Brother Jack, that first time
[4:21] I come up here, he said, "You ain't no
[4:22] preacher." He said, "No, Brother Jason,
[4:24] you can lay $10 million on the hood of
[4:26] my truck." And I'll tell you, take that
[4:28] money and go, I am not called to preach.
[4:29] And the only way I'll get up here and
[4:31] preach Jesus Christ or have to come back
[4:33] himself and tell me face to face. And
[4:35] that revelation hit me when I give my
[4:37] testimony in Mon Georgia. I a brother
[4:39] said that. He said, "You, I believe you
[4:40] called to preach." I said, "You listen
[4:42] to me." And that revelation dropped down
[4:43] in my heart right then. And I said,
[4:45] "Listen to me. I ain't called to preach.
[4:47] Jesus Christ gonna have to come face to
[4:49] face to me and tell me himself." And
[4:50] that revelation hit me like a rock. And
[4:52] I said, "That ain't going to happen."
[4:53] Because we meet him in air. He don't
[4:55] come back down. We meet him in the air.
[4:57] Woo. This is rich.
[5:00] Then he led me to the recliner, showed
[5:03] me the power of prayer.
[5:07] You must have 100% faith together
[5:11] or your pastor can't help you. And
[5:14] brother Jason Watkins, I got 100% faith
[5:16] in that man. You hear me?
[5:18] No, it was everybody's prayers together.
[5:20] But whenever me and him prayed, I don't
[5:22] know, there's something there. There's
[5:23] just no doubt whatsoever. And I told
[5:26] brother Jason, I said, I just lost my
[5:27] job. I just lost my excavator. And
[5:30] brother Tony, I just lost that brand new
[5:31] Peterbuilt truck only 11,000 miles on
[5:34] it. But that's not my God.
[5:37] I didn't have one thought about it. I
[5:38] lost that truck. They called me in and
[5:40] said, "I don't need you no more.
[5:41] Wouldn't tell me why." I said, "Tell me
[5:42] why this man let his daughter take the
[5:44] place over. I've been with them nine
[5:45] years. I didn't have nothing in writing,
[5:47] but I they the man, her daddy is losing
[5:50] his mind like and this man that was
[5:53] sitting in the office with him, they got
[5:54] rid of him, give him part of the
[5:56] business." And I went straight to him
[5:57] when I found out what happened. I said,
[5:58] "You need to go to them." I said, "You
[6:00] you know what we had? I didn't have it
[6:02] in writing." And I said, uh, the
[6:04] agreement we had, I I haven't helped
[6:06] them in a year. I've got my own work in
[6:08] a whole year. Hadn't even helped them
[6:10] take their machine and go do the work. I
[6:12] could take that machine and rent rent
[6:14] one myself. I'd made them $90,000. In
[6:16] one month, I could have took a rent a
[6:18] machine and put $50,000 in my pocket.
[6:20] But this brother here don't chase money.
[6:22] You hear me? I hope this is a blessing
[6:24] for somebody. I know it's got to be. But
[6:27] anyway, I'm going to read you what
[6:28] whenever that I sat under my chair and
[6:30] that come God. This little tablet's
[6:33] help, brother Jack. I know y'all might
[6:35] see some. This is a Bible on it, too. I
[6:37] got the Bible on it. But I'm tell you,
[6:38] this tablet has helped, brother Jack,
[6:40] cuz I can follow along with that
[6:41] prophet. And God is just opening things
[6:42] up to me, open things up. When he when
[6:45] he revealed that to me, I punched on my
[6:47] tablet and punch in uh about your
[6:49] pastor. Listen to this. This not my
[6:52] words.
[6:53] your godly pastor,
[6:56] his holy sanctified hands upon you. You
[7:00] know, you called him to pray for you.
[7:02] And that's exactly what I've done. When
[7:03] I Brother Jason don't hear from me much,
[7:05] but whenever I call him, he knows that
[7:06] something's serious because I know he's
[7:08] a dedicated man of God. I send him text
[7:10] sometime, and he loves that. And I sent
[7:12] him a text other morning. I said, "I'm
[7:14] sorry. I sent you a text early, but I've
[7:16] been bubbling over and I couldn't hold
[7:17] it." He said, uh, said, "What is it? Is
[7:21] your pastor's faith with yours? Yes,
[7:24] sir. He's not a sideline man. He's a God
[7:28] servant right up in the front line with
[7:30] a two-edged sword in his hand.
[7:32] Certainly, he sure is.
[7:34] And here's another one. Put your hands
[7:37] on him by faith and believe it. That's
[7:40] where it's at. This is Brother Brandon.
[7:42] Ask your pastor to pray for you. Prayer
[7:45] changes things.
[7:47] What does it do? It doesn't heal you. It
[7:50] gives you faith to accept what God's
[7:52] already done for you.
[7:54] Amen.
[7:55] You know, this this is the house of
[7:59] judgment. House of God where God comes
[8:01] down and passes his judgment. Your
[8:03] pastor is supposed to be a righteous
[8:05] man. And brother Jason is the
[8:07] congregation supposed to be with him
[8:10] 100%.
[8:12] You're supposed to be a 100% together.
[8:16] That's right.
[8:18] I can't. I mean, something else
[8:19] happened, but I can't. God didn't want
[8:20] me to say this. And in there, if you're
[8:23] not, then Satan's got a way to get in.
[8:27] But this takes a consecrated life, a
[8:30] dedicated life. And this, we know time
[8:32] to fool around, people. This thing's
[8:33] fixing to close. I'm telling you,
[8:36] this this this robber flesh, y'all ain't
[8:38] never seen me, but this robber flesh is
[8:40] fixing to drop.
[8:42] And this body's fixing to be changed.
[8:44] Oh, God. Hallelujah.
[8:46] Oh. All right. Now, I called Brother
[8:49] Jason. I said, "Uh, Brother Jason, I
[8:52] need you to pray for me." Um, I just
[8:56] lost my job. I just lost that brand new
[8:57] Peter belt truck. They told me to go
[8:59] clean my truck out. They wanted my
[9:01] pickup truck. Give me your phone, your
[9:02] credit card. They wouldn't tell me why.
[9:04] I said, "Tell me what's wrong." And I
[9:06] knew sooner or later it weren going to
[9:07] work out because a woman his daughter
[9:09] took it over and then uh said, "We
[9:12] sending the boy I'm sending the boys
[9:14] right now to your house to get the
[9:15] lowboard truck." I said, "That's fine.
[9:16] Go ahead. I'll go clean my truck out." I
[9:18] went and clean my truck up. Oh my
[9:20] goodness. And uh I said, "Brother Jason,
[9:23] I need you to pray for me." I said,
[9:25] "Everybody in Brunswick, Georgia knows
[9:27] me and knows my character. They know
[9:29] what kind of man I am." I'm tell you
[9:30] there's some people that ain't even
[9:32] don't even know Christ and people that
[9:34] might know Christ and but they know what
[9:37] happened and and they mad about it. They
[9:38] said I know we know Jack guest
[9:40] character. I said I got five different
[9:43] companies right now. They they
[9:45] approached me two years ago when we sold
[9:47] part of the business out. One of them
[9:48] was an accounting commissioner friend of
[9:49] mine. He said I'll buy you anything you
[9:51] want if you come with me. But see this
[9:54] brother don't chase money. Uh, and I
[9:57] said, "Uh, I got to let the Lord lead
[9:59] me." And I told, "Brother Jason," I
[10:01] said, "I need you to pray for me. I got
[10:02] five different companies ready to buy me
[10:04] anything I want, but I got to know the
[10:06] perfect will of God." He said, "Brother
[10:07] Jack, don't don't sound like I need to
[10:09] pray for you a job. Sound like I need to
[10:11] pray. Which one?" I said, "That's
[10:12] exactly right." And, "Brother Jason, I
[10:14] didn't know this, but I I had five
[10:16] things. Five things wrote down." How
[10:19] many people go to a job and tell them,
[10:20] "Man, this is what this is how it's
[10:21] going to be. You going to have to do
[10:22] this or I ain't coming with you." And I
[10:25] come to find out I have seven things.
[10:27] I wrote it down. I got it. I wrote it
[10:29] down. All seven things. I told Brother
[10:30] Jason, I said, "If this man, he's only
[10:33] he's only two minutes from my house, 43
[10:35] years old, loves me to death because he
[10:37] knows my character." And he I said, "If
[10:40] he don't agree to these uh five things,
[10:43] Brother Jason," which it was seven now.
[10:45] I said, "If he don't agree to these
[10:46] seven things, I'll know it ain't the
[10:48] will of God for me to go there."
[10:49] See, this is faith. This is faith. Not
[10:52] that guest. Right.
[10:53] The word, hearing the word builds faith.
[10:56] And I ain't where I'm supposed to be
[10:57] yet, but I'll tell you what, I'm steady
[10:58] gaining. And I told brother Jason, I
[11:00] said, I wish God had moved moved me here
[11:02] 15 years ago, but me and Sister Kathy
[11:04] Weather, we prayed a whole year. We
[11:05] would not move on our own. And I said,
[11:08] they ain't no devil in hell can shake
[11:10] this brother from this place. You hear
[11:11] me? I got a clear-cut decision. I know
[11:13] what I'm talking about.
[11:15] And then I said, uh uh I said, if he
[11:18] don't agree to these seven things, I
[11:20] ain't going with him. He said, "That's
[11:21] the way we're going to pray at, brother
[11:22] Jack. And if he don't agree to them, my
[11:24] second choice was county commissioner
[11:25] friend of mine." And then I didn't know,
[11:28] but I got seven choices. My son, my
[11:29] youngest son, tried to best to get me to
[11:31] go with him. He said, "I got all kind of
[11:33] people. I got work. You got work. They
[11:35] looking at the dollar. This brother
[11:37] ain't looking at the dollar. You hear
[11:38] me?" And anyway, uh, so I said, "No, I
[11:41] can't do that." But anyway, um, so I I
[11:45] prayed about when I got out of my
[11:46] recliner,
[11:48] that same message. You can't put
[11:50] something like this together. That same
[11:52] message when I went to get Sister Kathy,
[11:55] my angels will go before me. When I was
[11:58] sitting in that recliner, when I got up
[11:59] that morning, I said, "Lord Jesus, your
[12:00] angel will go before me."
[12:02] And I'll tell you what, if I these eyes
[12:04] have been open, and there's some other
[12:05] stuff happened. I told Brother Jason,
[12:06] I'm hoping to see that angel to come to
[12:08] me. Uh if God permits it, if he don't,
[12:11] that's fine, too. But I I said uh and I
[12:14] got up and told Sister C, I'm going to
[12:15] talk. I said, and she'd been pray. She
[12:17] prayed for me. And I went to this man.
[12:19] Listen, I went to this man and I said,
[12:22] "Uh,
[12:24] I got seven things you got to agree to."
[12:26] And I already signed my name to it. I
[12:28] said, "I ain't going to get messed up
[12:29] again. Me give me giving money away to
[12:31] people and they don't even appreciate
[12:32] it. And I could have been a boy, I could
[12:34] have been a multi-millionaire. This
[12:36] other fell I worked with, I didn't do
[12:37] this until I got a clear-cut decision
[12:39] from God. I didn't work for five solid
[12:42] months when God uh I didn't even know
[12:45] brother Jack Palmer but I went into a
[12:46] two weeks fast and God laid on I didn't
[12:49] hunger or nothing but I tell you what
[12:50] time of coming out two weeks fast I
[12:52] didn't know brother Jack Palmer from
[12:53] nothing a woman that still smoked got
[12:55] him to come to Patterson Georgia two
[12:57] miles from my house and the house is
[12:59] still standing out just about to fall
[13:00] down he showed me that film I went to
[13:02] Brunswick Georgia and I got me a job and
[13:04] I drove back and two for 33 years to
[13:05] make Georgia and Sister Kathy and the
[13:07] young we pack the young in there leave
[13:09] early and get back at 9:00 at night.
[13:11] And anyway, uh so then I I said, "I got
[13:14] seven things you got to agree with." He
[13:16] said, "Uh he got the paper from me. I I
[13:20] ain't got it with me." Anyway, uh he got
[13:22] the paper from me. He looked at that
[13:24] thing real quick. He said, "Jack, guess
[13:25] I ain't got no problem. Just sign that
[13:28] thing and I told him what I had to have
[13:29] by hour and he put that on there." He he
[13:32] told the secretary, "Make a copy of this
[13:34] and put it in our file." That's mine and
[13:35] Jack Guess's uh agreement.
[13:38] Woo!
[13:39] Man,
[13:41] and now listen to this. Kathy said, "Why
[13:42] in the world you do this?" But see, I'm
[13:45] led of the spirit of God. When God tells
[13:47] this boy something, my young, my oldest
[13:50] son said, "I'm sure glad you wasn't
[13:51] Abraham, cuz you would have took that
[13:52] sword and cut me, killed me." I said,
[13:54] "You exactly right. If he told this
[13:56] brother here to do done that, cuz I'm
[13:58] Abraham's seed, I would have sure done
[14:00] it." And anyway, anyway, that's another
[14:03] thing. I didn't have this in there. God
[14:04] put it in there. And anyway, uh, how
[14:07] many I mean that seven things you don't
[14:09] go to a boss man tell him what you got
[14:10] to have and listen to this here.
[14:13] Uh, I said, "I want to pick out what
[14:16] kind of truck I want." And I said, "It's
[14:18] got to be exactly what I want." He and
[14:21] and he said, "Uh, what do you want,
[14:23] Jack?" I said, "I want a Chevrolet or
[14:24] GMC." And I said, "What?" I said, "I
[14:27] want to pick the color of it." And that
[14:30] reminded me that little girl, Brother
[14:31] Brandon pulled to her. She didn't have
[14:32] no eyeballs. And them eyeballs come in
[14:34] there. I'm still his child. She was his
[14:37] child. And he stopped for a minute.
[14:39] Brother Benn said, "What color do you
[14:40] want, baby?" She said, "I heard blue was
[14:43] pretty
[14:44] and give her the prettiest blue set of
[14:46] eyes you ever seen."
[14:47] That same God didn't leave her, Brother
[14:49] Brandon. He's here with us. You hear me?
[14:51] All it takes is faith.
[14:53] Brother Brandon said, "If I I can
[14:55] produce it. the congregation get
[14:57] consecrated to God and dedicate their
[15:00] life to God, come with one mind and one
[15:02] accord, they want every sick person walk
[15:05] out of that door.
[15:06] He'll be completely healed before he
[15:07] walks out that door. That's not my
[15:09] words.
[15:10] And anyway, I said, "Uh, what?" He said,
[15:12] "What color do you want, Jack?" I said,
[15:14] "Well, that one I had that boss man gave
[15:16] me." He that boss man gave me a truck
[15:17] and he took my old one. And that speaks
[15:19] for itself there. And I um I said,
[15:22] "Well, I like that uh dark charcoal
[15:25] kind, but I really like burgundy."
[15:29] He started smiling. This man already
[15:31] picked my truck up for him. Went to work
[15:33] with him.
[15:35] He started smiling. He said, "I already
[15:36] picked your truck out. It's burgundy."
[15:38] And he asked my wife before we even went
[15:40] to the mountains. Me and Kathy already
[15:42] playing go to the mountains anyway. And
[15:44] uh he asked my, "What's your wife's
[15:46] name, Jack?" And I didn't catch on to
[15:48] it. I said, "Kathy." And we done paid
[15:50] for most of the motel room, but I mean
[15:51] the cabin. And he he called before we
[15:55] got there. I hadn't even went to work
[15:56] with this man. He didn't know if I was
[15:57] coming. Undoubtedly, he felt something.
[15:59] And he he paid for our cabin. We didn't
[16:02] know a dime when we got there. I hadn't
[16:03] even signed on with him. That's God.
[16:06] I'm getting credit. This boy, he won't
[16:08] take no credit from God. He knows this
[16:09] boy. You hear me? God knows him. And uh
[16:12] so he said, "I done picked you one out.
[16:14] It's burgundy. This boy is only 43 years
[16:16] old." He said, "I've been knowing you,
[16:18] Jack, since I was a little boy. you done
[16:19] work for my granddaddy? And said, I know
[16:21] your character, buddy. He said,
[16:23] everybody here in Glen County knows your
[16:25] character. That's the reason everybody
[16:26] wants you. And uh um and they know the
[16:30] business I got built over the years that
[16:32] God gave me. And anyway,
[16:36] he we I went with him to Folkston,
[16:38] Georgia. He had a business down there
[16:40] and he already talked to the man that
[16:42] works with him and he had a truck and he
[16:44] was going to buy him a new one. Now
[16:46] look, I want you to watch God. He had a
[16:48] new one and um he said, "Uh I can't sell
[16:52] it, Josh. Uh I can't find what I want."
[16:54] They said it' be January 4. They can
[16:55] find what I want. And me and Josh
[16:57] started to back up and he said, "There's
[16:59] a truck right there, Jack." And he said,
[17:00] "I could have swore that truck was
[17:01] burgundy, but it was a brown color." I
[17:05] said, "Josh, you remember what we talked
[17:07] what happened there about that burgundy
[17:08] truck?" He said, "Yeah." So we looked
[17:10] everywhere. Me and Sister Kathy look,
[17:12] she'd tell you we called. I called.
[17:14] North Carolina close to Virginia had
[17:16] two, but it wasn't a color. And I didn't
[17:17] feel good about I was thirding in the
[17:19] flesh and I said, "Well, no, that ain't
[17:21] what I'm supposed to get." And Josh, I
[17:23] said, "I'm going to Baxley, Georgia.
[17:25] This man Woody Fam, he got he got a half
[17:27] a city block Chevrolet, GMC, Ford. He
[17:29] got all of it." And uh he called him. He
[17:32] he called him. He said, "Jack, I called
[17:34] him. He ain't got one."
[17:36] He said, "You can go if you want to." I
[17:37] said, "No, I ain't going."
[17:40] So, uh, we went to I had to move a
[17:43] machine there. So we went to uh
[17:46] Jacksonville and on the way to
[17:47] Jacksonville Kathy I a spiritual person
[17:50] nervous and Kathy gets upset when that
[17:51] hope when that anointing comes on me I
[17:54] get so nervous and I get I get to
[17:55] staggering like a drunk man people and
[17:57] just that ain't Jack guess and uh she
[18:00] she's seen how I was this week. So, we
[18:02] got in the car, let her drive, and I
[18:04] punched in. We don't have internet, but
[18:05] I punched in on the data thing on the
[18:07] phone, and um I punched in GMC
[18:12] dealership.
[18:14] And the first one come up, it said GMC,
[18:16] and I thought this I punched on it. It
[18:18] was a car lot that mostly sells cars,
[18:20] but they sell some trucks, too. I said,
[18:22] "I'm coming to Jacksonville, Georgia.
[18:24] What kind of trucks you got?" I'm
[18:26] looking for a 2500 heavyduty Chevrolet
[18:29] or GMC uh diesel automatic. Addison
[18:32] automatic. And uh he said, "I got
[18:34] three." He said, "I got a burgundy one."
[18:37] Woo. You talking about something? He
[18:38] said, "I got a burgundy with with only
[18:40] 39,000 miles on it for $69,000.
[18:44] This is y'all's prayers. I'm telling
[18:45] you, this is y'all's prayer. This is the
[18:47] power of prayer here." Not Jack Guiss,
[18:49] not brother Jason. Not only this church,
[18:51] I have brother Tim Puit's church
[18:53] praying. Brother Wayne Lawson's a
[18:55] personal friend of mine. Me and him
[18:56] talked. I had him praying. I told him
[18:57] about it. And uh and sister K said,
[19:00] "What you want to call him?" I said,
[19:00] "I'm going to get everybody I know to
[19:02] pray." And because I know what they're
[19:04] done for her today. And so uh he said,
[19:06] "I got that burgundy and I got a brand
[19:08] new one just rolled off the truck." And
[19:11] he said, "You can pick which one you
[19:13] want." He said, "I got a black GMC
[19:14] Denelli." And I said, "We've been there
[19:17] a minute." And we got there and I didn't
[19:18] call him. Me and Sister Kathy pulled in.
[19:20] The cars was up front and I pulled right
[19:22] around back and here said that that
[19:23] burgundy's truck sideways. She said,
[19:25] "Look at there. What a beautiful truck."
[19:28] I said I said, "Yeah, that's it. That's
[19:30] it." And uh uh so she got out and I
[19:32] said, "Where you at? Where you at?" She
[19:34] done got in the driver's seat of it. I
[19:35] didn't know where she went. And I said,
[19:37] "Uh um" I started crying when I got out.
[19:41] I started crying and I called the boss
[19:44] man. I said, "This one's 69,000." No,
[19:46] I'm the carninal man. The carinal
[19:48] working man would have picked this one
[19:49] right here. This just come off the
[19:51] showroom floor, 11 miles on it. I could
[19:55] have got that truck for $80,000.
[19:59] But you remember that burgundy truck I
[20:01] was talking about? This is a burgundy
[20:03] truck with 39,000 miles on it. I'm going
[20:06] to tell you what them them people at
[20:07] that car lot, they got witnessed to. I
[20:10] didn't have to put no money down on I
[20:11] said, "Let me tell you something. If you
[20:12] sell that truck before I get back," I
[20:14] said, "We going to bring you a check. We
[20:15] don't need no financing." this man I
[20:16] work with. He said we going to bring him
[20:18] a check. Tell him uh he said tell him I
[20:20] said I'll be back tomorrow. I'm said I
[20:22] pity y'all if y'all let that burgundy
[20:23] truck get away here from here before I
[20:25] get back. And you know what the boss man
[20:28] put it in my lap.
[20:30] See God want to see what I do see. But
[20:33] he knew he could trust me. Say but he
[20:35] put it he said time put it in your lap
[20:36] and see what you do. My boss man called
[20:39] me. He said Jack it don't matter to me.
[20:41] Whichever one you want I'm gonna bite. I
[20:44] said okay. I went back in there and
[20:46] talking to him. I said, "Well, my boss
[20:48] man told me any one truck I want. I
[20:50] could get this brand new truck or I can
[20:52] get this one." I said, "You know," I
[20:54] said, "I'd be scared to death to pick
[20:56] this truck." I said, "Because when I
[20:57] drove off, I'd probably gotten a wreck
[20:59] or got killed. I don't know." I said,
[21:01] "But I am not picking that truck." I
[21:04] said, "I'm picking that truck." I said,
[21:05] "And and he said I said, you have it
[21:08] flat full of fuel when I get back and
[21:10] have it ready and we'll bring you a
[21:11] check. We don't need no financing." And
[21:13] the excavator they took from me was that
[21:15] one there with 6,400
[21:19] hours on it. This is God people.
[21:22] That's a brand new one. He said he c he
[21:24] called the Caterpillar place before I
[21:25] even went to work with him. He said
[21:27] Jack's going to call you and you let him
[21:29] pick out any machine he wants. It don't
[21:30] matter what he wants. The one I picked
[21:33] was a Caterpillar uh uh 336 $441,000.
[21:39] He said, "If Jack wants that one, I'm
[21:40] going to cut you a check for it. We
[21:41] don't need no financing.
[21:43] All right.
[21:43] But he they didn't know it. But I
[21:45] already called the John Deere pl cuz in
[21:47] my heart I wanted the same one I had.
[21:50] This machine here only had 300
[21:53] uh 230 hours on it. And and it was in
[21:57] Orlando, Florida. And my cousin used to
[21:59] be the salesman there, but he got out
[22:01] and somebody else, but they knew me. All
[22:03] them John there people know me. And uh
[22:05] he said, "Jack, I can get you this one
[22:07] for 341,000.
[22:11] My boss boss man I just heard him said
[22:13] bring it on to John Deere. If Jack uh
[22:16] runs it and he likes it, y'all got to
[22:18] take it to Savannah uh the airport in
[22:20] Savannah. He's got a job there Monday
[22:22] morning to do with it. He said, "But if
[22:24] Jack don't like it, y'all can take that
[22:26] machine." And anyway, I went and run it.
[22:28] Kathy, come down there and took pictures
[22:30] and I run this machine and I said,
[22:32] "We'll take it." And Josh called him. He
[22:35] said, "We don't need no finance and I'm
[22:36] going to bring you a check. 341,000 plus
[22:38] tax." This is God, people.
[22:41] Yeah,
[22:42] there it is. There me standing on it.
[22:45] I tell you, put God first. You ain't got
[22:47] to worry. You ain't got to worry. He'll
[22:49] take care of you until I leave.
[22:50] Amen.
[22:51] I hope I don't never have to sit in that
[22:53] seat because this ain't my God.
[22:57] That's my God. And he's right in here.
[22:58] That's right.
[22:59] I've been sealed and they can't nobody
[23:00] tell me I ain't been sealed. And then he
[23:03] called my buddy, my county commissioner,
[23:06] and bought this dozer for me, too. And I
[23:09] and I was sitting in the seat with him.
[23:10] My county commissioner friend didn't
[23:12] know I was sitting in there. He said, "I
[23:13] got uh Jack guest sitting seat." He
[23:15] said, "I'm gonna tell you what. When
[23:16] that Caterpillar man told me he's going
[23:17] to you, I tried I scram. I said, "I
[23:19] can't talk to you anymore. I'll call
[23:20] Jack Guest and see if he's going to you
[23:22] cuz I was buy man anything I want." He
[23:24] said, "I'll let you have that dozer
[23:26] forund and I want to let you see how
[23:27] God's already working." Um, I'll let you
[23:30] have that doer for $130,000.
[23:33] I can't say what we what was said. I'll
[23:36] tell you on social. But anyway, I said,
[23:38] "Let me let me u let me talk to him." He
[23:42] said, "I got Jack guest coming right." I
[23:43] knew what the doer was cuz I know the
[23:45] man. I run it three minutes, parked it.
[23:47] I said, "It's it's what we want." I
[23:49] said, "But let me talk to him. I can
[23:50] save you some money." I talked to my
[23:52] friend. He said, "I'll let y'all with
[23:55] him. I'll let you have it for $125,000."
[23:57] I saved him $5,000 just like that.
[24:00] And anyway, I've had I've had five to 10
[24:02] machines. I have never never
[24:06] had one with this on it. You talking

[42:17] Yes, you did.
[42:20] [Music]
[42:24] He's
[42:31] getting all kind of work out of me
[42:33] today.
[42:35] It needs to be a little higher, brother.
[42:45] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[42:51] Let's try um only I can think of is what
[42:53] I sung Wednesday night maybe in D again.
[42:59] I'm so glad that I appreciate that
[43:00] testimony, brother Jack. That was so
[43:02] good. Oh my. Power of prayer. Amen. You
[43:05] need to go back and listen to the Sunday
[43:07] school. That's exactly what I titled
[43:08] this morning. Sure did.
[43:12] I'm not on
[43:14] an ego trip.
[43:17] I'm nothing
[43:20] on my own.
[43:22] [Music]
[43:24] I make mistakes
[43:29] and often slip,
[43:32] just come in flesh
[43:35] and bone.
[43:38] But he'll prove someday
[43:43] just what I say.
[43:46] I'm of a special
[43:50] kind.
[43:52] When he
[43:54] was on the cross,
[43:57] [Music]
[43:59] I
[44:01] was on
[44:03] his mind.
[44:06] [Music]
[44:10] He knew
[44:12] me.
[44:16] Yet he loved me.
[44:24] Oh, he whose glory
[44:28] makes
[44:30] the heaven shine.
[44:37] No one unworthy
[44:41] [Music]
[44:44] of such mercy.
[44:52] When he was on the cross,
[44:59] I was on
[45:02] his mind.
[45:05] [Music]
[45:11] A look of love
[45:13] is on his face.
[45:17] Thorns
[45:20] on his head.
[45:22] [Music]
[45:23] Oh, the blood ran down that scarlet
[45:29] road
[45:31] and stained it crimson
[45:34] red.
[45:37] Though his eyes were on
[45:41] the crowd that day,
[45:45] he looked ahead
[45:48] in time
[45:51] when he
[45:53] was on
[45:54] the cross that day. Oh, you and I were
[46:00] on
[46:01] his mind. Won't you stand with me? Sing
[46:05] that part. Oh, he knew
[46:10] me.
[46:14] Yes, he loves.
[46:17] Make it personal this morning.
[46:21] Oh, he
[46:23] whose glory
[46:26] makes
[46:28] the heaven shine.
[46:33] [Music]
[46:34] So unworthy.
[46:39] Oh, I didn't deserve anything.
[46:44] Thank you, Jesus.
[46:49] When he's
[46:51] on the cross,
[46:55] you and I
[46:58] were on his mind. One more time, just
[47:02] sing it to him this morning. know my
[47:06] he knew
[47:08] me.
[47:10] [Music]
[47:22] Glory
[47:24] makes
[47:26] the heaven shine.
[47:30] [Music]
[47:33] So unworthy.
[47:36] Oh, do you love him this morning?
[47:39] Of such
[47:43] see
[47:48] when he was on the cross.
[47:55] I
[47:56] was on
[47:58] his mind.
[48:01] that when he
[48:03] was on the cross,
[48:09] I was on
[48:12] his mind.
[48:16] Amen.
[48:18] [Music]
[48:26] Amen. God bless you all this morning.
[48:28] Happy to have you here in the house of
[48:31] God with us. Amen. You happy to be a
[48:34] Christian?
[48:35] Amen. I sure have enjoyed all the
[48:38] mornings so far. I was able to catch
[48:41] Brother Joe's. We're getting Brother
[48:43] Joe's getting a workout today. My
[48:45] goodness. Teaching the Sunday school
[48:46] class, singing special songs. Amen. I I

[48:57] agree, brother. Amen.
[49:02] Yeah. Praise the Lord. Brother Matthew,
[49:03] I heard you telling that, Brother Matt
[49:05] Smith. Um cuz Wednesday I was not
[49:08] actually scheduled to preach. And so it
[49:11] got switched around. We had to make it.
[49:13] We had a necessary change. And so I I
[49:15] come to the pull pit, you know, not
[49:17] expecting to preach. And so after the
[49:19] sermon, brother Matt,
[49:21] he said, "Inspiration, you know, just
[49:23] take the word and add the water of the
[49:25] Holy Spirit." and got in instant
[49:26] inspiration.
[49:28] Amen. So, we sure appreciate that. Amen.
[49:31] I want to uh welcome our visitors today,
[49:34] our friends here with the Curtises. God
[49:36] bless you. Enjoyed that singing. Happy
[49:38] to have you all here today. Amen. Happy
[49:40] to have Sister Amariah. Amen. Now, she's
[49:42] not a visitor, but I never get to see
[49:44] her, so I'm

[49:50] her and I run. I still can't catch her.
[49:53] Amen. So, Rosie, you need to hang
[49:55] around. and give Peppa a hug after
[49:56] church. Amen.
[49:59] Now that I've thoroughly embarrassed

[50:20] Brother Connie and Sister Moa still with
[50:22] us. Happy to have them here. They'll be
[50:23] here. And it's Sweden. Amen. Amen. I
[50:27] said Switzerland last time and Swed was
[50:30] quick to correct that.
[50:32] We're happy to have them here. They'll
[50:34] be here for a month or so. So, uh, y'all
[50:37] family uh y'all plan to get together and
[50:39] invite them to some fellowship. Amen.
[50:41] Show them some real southern
[50:43] hospitality.
[50:45] Amen. God bless you. We um uh we're
[50:47] going to I think brother Tony just
[50:49] decided to we have the offering basket
[50:51] at the back. Brother Luther, we uh kind
[50:53] of ran out of time, but it's all good.
[50:56] I'm happy in the Lord today. Uh you
[50:59] probably, Brother Richard, God bless
[51:01] you. You probably saw in the
[51:02] announcements that um we're going to
[51:04] have uh kind of one of our little
[51:06] impromptu singalongs in the fellowship
[51:08] hall. Usually that thing just
[51:10] spontaneously starts, but every once in
[51:12] a while we plan it. So, we've got plenty
[51:14] of singers here this weekend. So, if you
[51:16] want to hang around, hear some good
[51:18] toetapping Jubilee singing. Amen. We're
[51:21] going to extend the worship. Brother
[51:22] Jack actually made himself available to
[51:24] continue his testimony after fellowship
[51:27] after lunch for anybody who wants to
[51:29] hear the rest of it. And I promise you
[51:31] there's a lot more to hear. Amen. It's
[51:33] thrilling. Amen. To hear brother Jack to
[51:36] that. I said, "Brother Jack, your
[51:38] enthusiasm and your faith is contagious.
[51:41] My I never been so happy to be infected
[51:44] by something in my life. Praise God."
[51:47] So, uh, we're getting a little bit of a
[51:49] late start, but that's to my advantage,
[51:51] actually. So, the Lord knows all things.
[51:54] Uh, the enemy attacked me in body and
[51:57] all the brothers started praying. I put
[51:59] it out into the minister's chat to offer
[52:02] prayer for me. Don't really know. Just
[52:04] kind of a flu bug dropped in on me. Um,
[52:07] then I felt good yesterday and then last
[52:09] night it started feeling again. So, I
[52:10] woke up this morning and Sister Debbie
[52:12] said, "How do you feel?" I said, "Well,
[52:14] not perfect, but I'm perfect in the Lord
[52:16] anyway. So, it'll actually uh work to my
[52:19] advantage. Maybe we'll abbreviate our
[52:21] sermon just a little bit and that'll
[52:23] help me. Amen. So, God bless you as we
[52:26] turn to Revelation chapter 19.
[52:30] Amen. Revelation chapter 19. You say,
[52:33] "Brother Jason, you know, Revelation,
[52:37] anywhere in the book of Revelation ain't
[52:38] a text for a short sermon."
[52:42] I didn't say I was going to preach a
[52:43] short sermon. I just said we'll take it
[52:45] easy a little bit, but Amen. probably
[52:48] will end up a little bit. But um
[52:50] wouldong as you know that's the thing
[52:52] once the anointing comes on me and
[52:54] that's a real thing. Don't think that's
[52:56] a cliche. uh preacher, every preacher in
[52:59] here will tell you that is a actual
[53:02] thing that you can come into this pull
[53:04] pit, feel sick, be in pain, have an
[53:06] injury, something and anointing hits
[53:08] you, and you feel like you're 18 again
[53:10] and you ain't got a pain or a problem.
[53:13] But then as soon as you leave the pull
[53:15] pit,
[53:17] and you sit down, you What have I done?
[53:21] Amen. Amen. These preachers shaking,
[53:24] laughing their uh shaking their head,
[53:25] laughing. They they know what that's
[53:27] about. That's a very real thing.
[53:29] Revelation chapter 19, we'll just let
[53:32] we'll read this uh 10 verses and we'll
[53:34] let you be seated.
[53:37] Uh I'm going to um
[53:40] I'm going to continue reading, but we'll
[53:41] we'll let you be seated after verse 10.
[53:47] And after these things, I heard a great
[53:49] voice of much people in heaven saying,
[53:53] "Allelujah, salvation and glory and
[53:56] honor and power unto the Lord our God.
[54:01] For true and righteous are his
[54:04] judgments. For he hath judged the great
[54:07] which did corrupt the earth with
[54:10] her fornication,
[54:12] and hath avenged the blood of his
[54:15] servants at her hand. Um, Dr. Scoffield
[54:19] makes a mention that
[54:22] this word allelujah which is different
[54:24] than hallelujah is found only here in
[54:27] the Bible because that it is a direct
[54:30] reference through the Greek language.
[54:32] It's significant that it's allelujah
[54:35] because because of the verse that we
[54:38] just read. He hath judged the great
[54:40] This is something that nature has
[54:44] groaned and waited for the adoption of
[54:46] sons and waited for the antichrist
[54:49] system to be put down once and for all.
[54:55] I'm looking for the day when it's put
[54:57] down once and for all.
[55:01] Amen. We want to we want to talk about
[55:03] our part in that today. Are you aware
[55:05] you have a part to play in that?
[55:08] Amen. So he says
[55:11] verse two, "For true and righteous are
[55:13] the judgments for hath judged the great
[55:14] which had corrupt the earth with
[55:16] her fornication
[55:17] and how my and hath avenged the blood of
[55:20] his servants at her hand." And again
[55:23] they said allelujah. And her smoke rose
[55:26] up forever and ever. And the four and 20
[55:30] elders and the four beasts fell down and
[55:33] worshiped God that sat on the throne
[55:35] saying, "Amen, allelujah." They are
[55:38] thrilled about the destruction of this
[55:40] system. And a voice came out of the
[55:43] throne saying, "Praise our God, all ye
[55:46] his servants, and that ye that fear him,
[55:50] both small and great. And uh and I heard
[55:54] as it were the voice of a great
[55:56] multitude and as the voice of many
[55:59] waters and as the voice of mighty
[56:02] thunderings saying here it is again.
[56:04] Allelujah for the Lord God omnipotent
[56:08] reignth.
[56:09] Let us be glad and rejoice and give
[56:12] honor to him for the marriage of the
[56:14] lamb is come and his wife hath made
[56:18] herself ready.
[56:20] And to her was granted that she should
[56:22] be arrayed in fine linen, clean and
[56:25] white. For the fine linen is the
[56:27] righteousness of the saints. And he
[56:30] saith unto me, write, blessed are they
[56:33] which are called unto the marriage
[56:35] supper of the Lamb. And he saith unto
[56:37] me, these are the true sayings of God.
[56:41] And I fell at his feet to worship him.
[56:44] And he said unto me, See, thou do it
[56:46] not. I am thy fellow servant and of thy
[56:50] brethren that have the testimony of
[56:52] Jesus worship God. For the testimony of
[56:56] Jesus is the spirit of prophecy. Now you
[57:00] just keep your Bibles open. But let us
[57:02] pray.
[57:05] Father, I commit myself into your hands
[57:07] just now and I ask for you to be with me
[57:10] and body Lord and spirit. help my mind
[57:13] and Lord just be in on my lips that I
[57:16] speak exactly what it what it is that
[57:19] you have for us today. I commit myself
[57:22] into your hands now in this audience.
[57:24] May you bless both speaker and hearer.
[57:27] We commit it to you in Jesus name. Amen.
[57:31] God bless you friends. You can be
[57:32] seated.
[57:35] Now I wish to continue reading uh 11-15,
[57:41] but let me just uh you know perhaps make
[57:45] uh an opening statement or two.
[57:48] One of the things that you're you're
[57:51] you're going to want to realize, you're
[57:53] about to read about Thank you, brother
[57:56] Tony. You're about to read how in the
[57:59] very next verse he says, "And I saw
[58:02] heaven opened
[58:05] and behold a white horse and he that sat
[58:07] on him was called faithful and true and
[58:09] in righteousness doth he judge and make
[58:12] war." It goes on to describe
[58:16] this one coming. And we're going to find
[58:18] when we get down to verse 13 and verse
[58:22] 14 especially that the armies of heaven
[58:26] follow with him. Now the armies of
[58:29] heaven, I'll just tip you off. The
[58:31] armies of heaven are the bride because
[58:33] that's who he's talking about. The the
[58:35] bride hath made herself ready. See? And
[58:38] so now she's coming and she's clothed in
[58:42] fine linen. and the the literally uh
[58:45] you're finding Christ and his triumphant
[58:49] church coming back at the end of the
[58:52] tribulation to finish up and wrap up and
[58:56] to um to commence, if I could say it
[58:59] this way, to commence the transition,
[59:02] the final transition of the earth from a
[59:06] fallen state into a millennial state.
[59:09] And there he's going to lift the curse
[59:12] off the earth that came on the earth.
[59:14] When Adam fell in the garden of Eden
[59:16] when Adam fell being the son of God and
[59:19] the Bible doesn't call him merely a son
[59:21] of God. It calls him the son of God. And
[59:23] so we find that this is why Jesus would
[59:26] be called the second Adam. See because
[59:28] he's now the son of God. He's he's
[59:32] everything that that God envisioned uh
[59:35] when he thought of Adam and Eve that
[59:38] Christ and his bride are going to
[59:41] accomplish what Adam and Eve in the
[59:43] original failed to do. And so we realize
[59:46] that this is exactly why that that that
[59:51] in Adam the Bible says not in Eve. In
[59:54] Adam we all die.
[59:56] See because what Eve did Eve was
[59:58] deceived. It wasn't Eve. It was Adam who
[1:00:02] knowingly transgressed the word that
[1:00:04] plunged all of humanity into sin. When
[1:00:09] Eve did what she did, the earth didn't
[1:00:11] yet have a curse upon it. See? And so,
[1:00:14] uh, their bodies weren't even cursed
[1:00:16] yet. And so, we realize that that it's
[1:00:19] when Adam knowingly with his eyes open
[1:00:22] transgressed the word of God. Then when
[1:00:24] Adam fell, as the prophet would say,
[1:00:27] then all nature under him. And since
[1:00:29] Adam was the son of God in the earth, an
[1:00:32] amateur god to rule the earth, then all
[1:00:34] nature under him fell. So the second
[1:00:36] Adam which is now Christ begotten of a
[1:00:39] woman, right? To to virgin born, right,
[1:00:42] to reverse the sin in the garden and a
[1:00:46] blood sacrifice because that was the
[1:00:48] kind of sin it was and because life is
[1:00:50] in the blood and life was transmitted.
[1:00:53] And so we find that there had to be a
[1:00:55] blood sacrifice. This is the revelation
[1:00:57] Abel caught. This is what Cain missed
[1:00:59] and wasn't able to get a hold of. Uh
[1:01:01] Abel caught it right away that it had to
[1:01:03] be a blood offering. Without the
[1:01:05] shedding of blood, there could be no
[1:01:06] remission of sin. And so we find then
[1:01:09] that Christ as the second Adam. Uh then
[1:01:13] he you know uh conquers death by his own
[1:01:16] death and uh his burial and his
[1:01:19] resurrection. He receives the keys of
[1:01:21] death and hell and the grave. He com he
[1:01:24] ascends on high and says all power is
[1:01:26] given unto me in heaven and in earth.
[1:01:29] And so we realize now that in the in the
[1:01:32] first Adam we all die. In the second
[1:01:34] Adam we all live. Now in the first Adam
[1:01:37] he had a bride and that bride existed
[1:01:40] first in him and you couldn't see her.
[1:01:43] But finally there was an expression of
[1:01:45] her that you could see. And now at the
[1:01:48] end time, God bring what does he do on
[1:01:51] the other side of Calvary? He brings a
[1:01:54] bride into being that the world can see.
[1:01:57] But but now what they can't see is she's
[1:02:00] actually a part of him. She's actually
[1:02:03] an expression of God. And the same way
[1:02:06] they couldn't see, there was a time when
[1:02:08] Eve couldn't be seen in Adam. Then then
[1:02:10] we find that that in the eyes of God,
[1:02:13] you are seen as the same person.
[1:02:16] Amen.
[1:02:17] as Christ. She is him.
[1:02:21] See, and the spirit and the bride say,
[1:02:24] "Come." This is the great mystery
[1:02:26] released under the seventh seal. This is
[1:02:28] what the trinitarians miss. This is what
[1:02:31] the oneness miss. He's not three
[1:02:33] persons, but neither is he Jesus only.
[1:02:36] That all of those formulas have it
[1:02:38] wrong. That the that the correct formula
[1:02:41] has Christ and his bride, Mr. and Mrs.
[1:02:44] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:02:45] You say, "Well, if I'm Christ and he's
[1:02:47] Christ, then what's the difference
[1:02:49] between him and me?" He's both Lord and
[1:02:51] Christ. That's not you. I don't pray to
[1:02:54] you. You didn't baptize in my name. I
[1:02:57] didn't save you. He saved us all.
[1:03:00] Amen. So, this is why when the when John
[1:03:04] bows to worship this angel that he says,
[1:03:06] "Don't do that. We only worship God. I'm
[1:03:10] just a man. I'm saved by grace. I was
[1:03:13] born in sin like you." But God rich in
[1:03:15] mercy love me too.
[1:03:18] So we realize then that that the bride
[1:03:21] operates and the principle of this
[1:03:23] oneness this unity is found in Hebrews
[1:03:26] 138. It's exactly why brother Brandham
[1:03:29] that was the very commission of his
[1:03:30] ministry. Jesus Christ you see the same
[1:03:33] yesterday and forever. So the bride she
[1:03:36] is him doesn't mean the bride is
[1:03:38] literally him. It means the bride is the
[1:03:40] same as him. It's Jesus Christ the same.
[1:03:44] yesterday, today, and forever. So, we're
[1:03:47] always watching for the I am. Where is
[1:03:49] the I am? And that's what uh and that's
[1:03:52] what the world is missing today. Now, so
[1:03:55] when we come down to this point, you
[1:03:58] find that a bride and armies of heaven
[1:04:02] are following him out. And you'll notice
[1:04:05] that that when we read verse 14, "And
[1:04:08] the armies which were in heaven followed
[1:04:10] him upon white horses clothed in fin and
[1:04:13] white and clean." All right. So now we
[1:04:16] realize that the same act attributes of
[1:04:19] him are attributed to her because his
[1:04:21] name is called the word of God.
[1:04:23] Amen. That's not his name. That's what
[1:04:25] he's called. See, so and the armies of
[1:04:27] heaven which followed him. So this
[1:04:30] clothed in fine linen, clean and white,
[1:04:33] and the purity of the word, and out of
[1:04:35] his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with
[1:04:37] it he should smite the nations, and he
[1:04:40] shall rule them with a rod of iron. Now
[1:04:42] that is a millennium verse, and we know
[1:04:46] that we are to rule and reign with him.
[1:04:50] Amen.
[1:04:51] So now I want to point you very clearly.
[1:04:53] Look at look at verse 15 very closely.
[1:04:56] Out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword.
[1:04:59] That of course is the word. All right?
[1:05:01] It's symbolic. Just like when Moses and
[1:05:04] Elijah, the Bible talks about when they
[1:05:07] come against Moses and Elijah that
[1:05:10] anyone who comes against them, fire
[1:05:12] proceedth out of their mouth. Now, it it
[1:05:15] doesn't mean Moses and Elijah are fire
[1:05:17] breathing dragons.
[1:05:19] It's not it. Fire represents judgment.
[1:05:22] Their word controls nature and it's a
[1:05:24] judgment word. So it's not it's not a
[1:05:27] flamethrower type of that's not the
[1:05:29] imagery. This is all symbolism. And so
[1:05:32] in fact is we wouldn't even know that
[1:05:35] the horses are literal because you would
[1:05:38] only think of them as symbolic cuz
[1:05:40] everything here is symbolic and you
[1:05:42] wouldn't know that they were literal
[1:05:44] horses except that a prophet in this day
[1:05:47] when he's challenged on horses being on
[1:05:50] the other side and the man says brother
[1:05:52] Brandham I loved your testimony of
[1:05:55] beyond the curtain of time and I loved
[1:05:57] it until you said you saw your horse and
[1:06:00] and and there are no he heavens for
[1:06:02] humans,
[1:06:04] not horses. And brother Brandham said,
[1:06:06] well, he wrote him back a very courteous
[1:06:08] letter. And he said, well, first of all,
[1:06:10] brother, I never said I was in heaven. I
[1:06:12] said, I was in some place beautiful in
[1:06:14] paradise and saw the family of God
[1:06:16] there. And and he said, I asked to see
[1:06:18] Jesus and they said he's on up a little
[1:06:20] higher. You remember Paul was called up
[1:06:22] there to the third heaven. He said, I
[1:06:24] never said I was there. He said, but
[1:06:26] that it might help you. and he went to
[1:06:29] Revelation 19 when Christ comes out
[1:06:32] riding a white horse and the armies of
[1:06:34] heaven come following him on white
[1:06:35] horses.
[1:06:37] So, so, so thi this is why I'm so glad
[1:06:41] far vindicated prophet to sort all of
[1:06:43] this out for us. We would never have a
[1:06:44] way to know it.
[1:06:45] So, now watch, look at verse 15 because
[1:06:47] I'm really trying to I'm trying to get a
[1:06:50] certain angle to you before I go
[1:06:52] forward. So out of his mouth goeth a
[1:06:55] sharp sword that with it he should smite
[1:06:57] the nations and he shall rule them with
[1:07:00] a rod of iron and he treadth the wine
[1:07:03] press of the fierceness and wrath of
[1:07:05] almighty God. Now when you read verse 15
[1:07:09] of Revelation 19, you don't you don't
[1:07:13] think of any you think of only one
[1:07:17] person ruling in the millennium with a
[1:07:20] rod of iron because right here that's
[1:07:23] all it says.
[1:07:25] He shall has nothing about they shall.
[1:07:28] But we also know that in and they said,
[1:07:30] "Well, that's what the Bible says." And
[1:07:32] like brother Brandham, like that Baptist
[1:07:34] preacher said, "Brother Brandom, but the
[1:07:35] Bible says Abraham believed God and it
[1:07:38] was counted to him for righteousness."
[1:07:39] And brother Brandham says that's true.
[1:07:41] The Bible does say that. But the Bible
[1:07:45] also says that he was given a seal, a
[1:07:48] sign of circumcision a as part of the
[1:07:51] covenant that God recognized his faith.
[1:07:54] So we realize that verse 15 doesn't
[1:07:57] include you. But the Bible also tells us
[1:08:00] that we shall rule and reign with him.
[1:08:05] See? All right. Now, that's an important
[1:08:07] point. Just because you don't see it
[1:08:09] here, we find the truth of it. You find
[1:08:12] that so I could say to you that
[1:08:14] Revelation 19:15 contains a hidden
[1:08:18] mystery
[1:08:20] that's not viewable except by another
[1:08:22] scripture.
[1:08:24] Amen. All right. Now, I just want that
[1:08:26] in your mind real strong.
[1:08:29] All right. So, we find here that this
[1:08:32] this principle of Christ
[1:08:36] uh operating with his bride. Now, I've
[1:08:40] got I've got an unusual title for you
[1:08:43] today and so and I apologize for my
[1:08:47] quirkiness, but
[1:08:49] if the Lord wanted me to be somebody
[1:08:51] else, he'd have made me somebody else,
[1:08:52] right?
[1:08:54] I want to speak to you today on the
[1:08:57] dance begins.
[1:09:00] Amen.
[1:09:01] The dance begins.
[1:09:04] So we find in this in this analogy in
[1:09:08] that I'm breaking into right from the
[1:09:10] beginning. I'm trying to get you to
[1:09:12] understand this great mystery of Christ
[1:09:16] and his bride that it's a king and a
[1:09:19] queen. We find as we have found many
[1:09:22] times that at in revelation chapter 22
[1:09:25] it's the spirit and the bride saying
[1:09:28] come.
[1:09:28] Amen.
[1:09:29] See and so so strong is this principle
[1:09:33] that Jesus would actually talk about
[1:09:37] that whosoever sins his church would
[1:09:41] remit in the earth. They would be
[1:09:43] remitted in heaven. And whosoever sends
[1:09:45] his church his body retained they would
[1:09:48] be retained. So now you can see it's God
[1:09:52] working through his family. Now it's
[1:09:55] it's we don't follow the Catholic
[1:09:58] misunderstanding of that scripture that
[1:10:02] it's not a priest in garments sitting in
[1:10:04] a confessional. See that you're going to
[1:10:07] go and and and and confess your sins to
[1:10:09] him. And so it's not that that's a mis
[1:10:12] that's a misrepresentation. That's mixed
[1:10:14] misinterpreted theology. But what it is
[1:10:17] a prophet explained that when you
[1:10:20] because you have Christ in you and
[1:10:22] Christ is his word and when you and
[1:10:25] brother Bram talks about when the
[1:10:27] believer puts the word of God on his
[1:10:28] lips that's the same as deity speaking.
[1:10:31] Amen.
[1:10:32] See that's why Jesus said not not that
[1:10:34] I'm going to do it. He said you go into
[1:10:36] all the world and preach the gospel to
[1:10:39] every creature. See Jesus would say
[1:10:41] whatsoever you say if you say to this
[1:10:43] mountain. See, and so there the the
[1:10:45] whole purpose of the Holy Ghost was to
[1:10:48] continue the work of the Lord Jesus in a
[1:10:51] many membered form.
[1:10:52] God was never intending to stay bottled
[1:10:54] up in one body walking the shores of
[1:10:56] Galilee. The whole mystery of the
[1:10:59] Godhead is understood in expression.
[1:11:01] Amen.
[1:11:02] See, and so it's a God continuing to
[1:11:05] unfold himself. As we've said to you
[1:11:07] many times, it's it's where the I am is.
[1:11:11] And so we find it in various forms. And
[1:11:13] Moses saw him, he was a burning a fire
[1:11:16] in a burning bush. When Joshua met him
[1:11:18] later, he was a soldier. When Gideon met
[1:11:20] him at a later time, all down through
[1:11:22] the Bible, when Ezekiel found him, he's
[1:11:24] a wheel in the middle of the wheel. When
[1:11:26] John saw him, he was a human.
[1:11:28] Amen.
[1:11:29] Amen.
[1:11:31] Amen. Yeah.
[1:11:32] And so, so we find out that that that
[1:11:35] the book of Revelation goes on to
[1:11:37] declare how that he's going to
[1:11:40] incarnate. We've been using this word a
[1:11:42] lot. How that he's going to incarnate
[1:11:45] his church. And we read for you last
[1:11:47] time, Brother Brandham talking about
[1:11:49] incarnation. Might might refer to it
[1:11:51] again today perhaps if I get to it.
[1:11:55] But it's when a deity uh moves into the
[1:11:59] form of flesh, moves into a human form
[1:12:03] or it can be an animal because when
[1:12:04] Satan does it, it's a beast.
[1:12:07] All right? And so because Satan can't
[1:12:09] reproduce a human family, he doesn't
[1:12:11] have the power of creation.
[1:12:13] All right? So he he he he perverts God's
[1:12:15] word. Now, so we find it when Jesus, you
[1:12:19] know, talks about who so whosoever sins
[1:12:22] you remit or retain. And brother
[1:12:23] Brandham said, "It's you taking the
[1:12:25] gospel to them." Because when a
[1:12:27] Christian puts it on his lips, it's like
[1:12:28] God speaking. So when you take the
[1:12:30] gospel to them and they receive it, then
[1:12:33] you have been the vessel by which their
[1:12:35] sins were forgiven.
[1:12:37] And if you take the gospel to them,
[1:12:39] you've done your part. If they reject
[1:12:42] the gospel, they haven't rejected you.
[1:12:45] They've rejected the God in you coming
[1:12:47] through the word.
[1:12:49] See? And so your your your your hands
[1:12:52] are clean. And that's why Paul says, "I
[1:12:54] have not shunned to declare unto you the
[1:12:57] whole council of God on the day of
[1:12:59] judgment." Nobody is going to be able to
[1:13:02] wag a finger at Paul and say, "You never
[1:13:04] told me."
[1:13:07] They're not going to be able to say a
[1:13:09] prophet in this day. You didn't tell me.
[1:13:11] He told you on,200 plus tapes. Yes,
[1:13:14] we've got a Bible with thousands of
[1:13:16] pages and thousands thousands of words
[1:13:18] and hundreds and hundreds of pages and
[1:13:20] and God and then not only that, but even
[1:13:23] the the sun rises every day and declares
[1:13:25] his glory. All nature declares him. Even
[1:13:28] though it's under a curse and even
[1:13:30] though it's in a fallen state, it
[1:13:32] struggles to bring glory to God. Yes,
[1:13:36] I'm in a fallen state. Yes, I make
[1:13:38] mistakes. But I rise up every day. I'm
[1:13:40] not the su n. I'm an S O N and I try to
[1:13:44] bring glory
[1:13:46] to the world.
[1:13:49] See, so sometimes, you know, you never
[1:13:53] rise.
[1:13:55] The sun is to rise. The sun is to bring
[1:13:58] light to the earth.
[1:14:00] And sometimes, sadly, God's very own
[1:14:03] family members never shine.
[1:14:07] See, say, "Are they not God's children?"
[1:14:09] Oh, they're God's children, but they're
[1:14:11] living far below their privileges.
[1:14:13] They're not, as brother Jack was talking
[1:14:15] about today, they're not surrendering
[1:14:17] their lives to the level I'm here to
[1:14:19] tell you something, friends. The world
[1:14:21] is so dark and so toxic
[1:14:23] that you've got to press daily to shine.
[1:14:26] You've got to press constantly to shine.
[1:14:29] You can't leave it on autopilot. You got
[1:14:31] to be proactive. You got to make a
[1:14:33] determination. I'm going to wake up
[1:14:35] today and get close to God. I'm going to
[1:14:38] move out through the day and I'm going
[1:14:39] to let God speak to me. Sometimes we we
[1:14:42] go a whole day and say, "How many times
[1:14:44] have I even thought about God?"
[1:14:47] Amen.
[1:14:51] More to say on that shortly.
[1:14:55] It's really that's the really the the
[1:14:57] catalyst of my title actually. You'll
[1:15:00] find out.
[1:15:02] So this whole principle of Christ and
[1:15:05] his bride, Christ and his armies and all
[1:15:07] with similar descriptions.
[1:15:11] And so you find
[1:15:15] that that Jesus,
[1:15:17] you know, when he's looking out, I'm
[1:15:19] just giving you these examples because
[1:15:21] you're familiar with them. He looks out
[1:15:22] across a a vineyard and he says,
[1:15:26] "Truly," looks I don't remember if it
[1:15:27] was a vineyard. It might have been a
[1:15:28] field of wheat. I can't remember. But he
[1:15:30] says truly the the it's it's white unto
[1:15:34] harvest.
[1:15:34] Yeah.
[1:15:35] And but the the problem is the laborers
[1:15:38] are few.
[1:15:40] Pray ye to the Lord of the harvest that
[1:15:43] he sent forth laborers.
[1:15:46] And brother Brandon picks that up and
[1:15:48] says, "Isn't it amazing that Jesus
[1:15:52] himself
[1:15:53] saying to these people, pray ye the Lord
[1:15:56] of the harvest?" And he said Harry stood
[1:15:58] he was the Lord of the harvest.
[1:16:00] So what he's saying to he said then what
[1:16:03] Jesus is really trying to say is uh you
[1:16:07] know I I want to do this.
[1:16:10] I'm just I'm declaring to you my intent,
[1:16:13] my desire. There's a ripened field and
[1:16:16] it needs harvesting and I want to
[1:16:18] harvest it. But I I want you to ask me,
[1:16:22] pray to me to do it. Say, why in the
[1:16:25] world is that? because I want your
[1:16:27] involvement.
[1:16:29] I want your words to be my words and my
[1:16:31] words to be your words. And when I say
[1:16:33] go forth and labor, you'll rise up and
[1:16:35] say, "Go forth and labor." And whatever
[1:16:38] the voice speaks in heaven, we find
[1:16:40] ourselves in the earth moving.
[1:16:45] This is what dance is.
[1:16:47] That's right.
[1:16:48] Dance is expression.
[1:16:51] That's why it's called an art. It's a
[1:16:53] It's an art form. It's an it's an it's
[1:16:55] an expression and there's a holy dance
[1:16:57] and there's an unholy dance perverted by
[1:17:00] Satan.
[1:17:00] Amen.
[1:17:02] See? All right. Now, so we find then
[1:17:05] that he's wanting interaction with his
[1:17:08] family. That's always been his goal, to
[1:17:10] have fellowship with his family, to be
[1:17:13] in harmony with that family concerning
[1:17:16] his will, which which is all good
[1:17:20] and all pure
[1:17:22] all the time.
[1:17:24] So, let me just tell you today, you just
[1:17:27] do what he wants you to do.
[1:17:28] It'll turn out great.
[1:17:30] You don't have to understand it. If your
[1:17:32] faith is limited to your understanding,
[1:17:34] you're in a sad state of affairs. My
[1:17:36] faith goes way beyond my understanding.
[1:17:40] Oh my. It, you know, it it so it's as if
[1:17:43] he has this conversation with himself to
[1:17:45] demonstrate this principle. And you
[1:17:48] know, what could that mean for us
[1:17:50] friends as the final voice to the final
[1:17:53] age? I mean, the Bible talks about in
[1:17:56] the last days that that God is calling
[1:17:59] for saviors. In the Hebrew, it means
[1:18:01] intercessors. He's calling for saviors.
[1:18:03] He's called say but only Jesus is the
[1:18:06] savior but he's calling for intercessors
[1:18:08] people who will pray and dedicate their
[1:18:11] life and go forth in the name of the
[1:18:14] lord.
[1:18:15] This is the great mystery that has been
[1:18:18] revealed that Paul says was hidden from
[1:18:20] the ages that is this Christ in you
[1:18:25] and the hope of glory. Yeah.
[1:18:27] So in you doesn't doesn't just in you
[1:18:31] stop doesn't make glory cuz glory is an
[1:18:33] expression.
[1:18:35] Amen.
[1:18:36] Amen.
[1:18:37] So the sun is in existence but you don't
[1:18:39] see its glory until it's in the sky.
[1:18:42] So glory means an expression. So it's
[1:18:44] Christ in you the hope of in other words
[1:18:47] in the hope that you will let this mind
[1:18:50] which was in Christ be in you and that
[1:18:53] it will be Christ in you the hope of
[1:18:55] glory that my life will bring him glory
[1:18:58] and God will have his life that he lived
[1:19:00] in Jesus and and and Mrs. Jesus all
[1:19:03] around the world.
[1:19:06] This is exactly the plan of redemption.
[1:19:09] This is how it's supposed to work. See,
[1:19:13] so you can imagine then how tragic it
[1:19:16] is.
[1:19:17] How tragic it is when
[1:19:20] and and this is probably a statement
[1:19:22] that everybody who's not here needs to
[1:19:24] be here to hear,
[1:19:27] but let let me just say, let me say it
[1:19:29] to you who are here.
[1:19:31] Per adventure, Satan tries to get you in
[1:19:34] in days down the road to not be here.
[1:19:36] Amen. You know th this is why it's this
[1:19:39] is why it's so tragic when God has
[1:19:41] family who are his actual seated family
[1:19:45] but they have let the cares and affairs
[1:19:47] of this life choke out the love and life
[1:19:50] of God and they're and they're they put
[1:19:52] every other thing ahead of church and
[1:19:55] schedule and in their schedule
[1:19:56] everything else ahead of being the glory
[1:19:58] of God and all they are is the glory of
[1:20:02] some business or they're the they're the
[1:20:04] glory of some sport or they're the glory
[1:20:06] of some entertainment. I'm not here to
[1:20:08] be glory for any of that stuff.
[1:20:11] Not here to be the glory of Leodysia.
[1:20:14] I'm here to be the living glory of
[1:20:16] almighty God.
[1:20:19] Amen.
[1:20:20] And that's why you see them of God's
[1:20:24] family making decisions so effortlessly
[1:20:27] to not be to not give themselves over so
[1:20:32] fully and freely to the presence of God.
[1:20:37] Amen.
[1:20:39] Amen.
[1:20:41] So, so he calls for saviors today. He
[1:20:46] calls for intercessors.
[1:20:48] The Bible prophesied that in the last
[1:20:50] days that those who know their God will
[1:20:51] do great exploits.
[1:20:54] Say what are we going to do? Whatever it
[1:20:56] is, it'll be great.
[1:20:57] Amen.
[1:20:58] Might not be what the world calls great.
[1:21:00] Are you okay with that?
[1:21:02] Are you okay to be a weirdo and an
[1:21:04] oddball and a nut? Cuz what the Lord
[1:21:06] might call great for you to do, you
[1:21:08] might not think is great. and your
[1:21:11] neighbors and your ma and your
[1:21:12] associates and your business partners
[1:21:14] and and and and and
[1:21:16] your customers, brothers. All you half
[1:21:18] the most of the men in here are are
[1:21:19] self-employed. Your customers might not
[1:21:21] think it's great,
[1:21:23] but does God think it's great? Amen.
[1:21:27] So now
[1:21:30] with this principle in mind,
[1:21:36] you can see how very tragic
[1:21:40] Revelation 3
[1:21:43] finds the church. 3:17, Brother Brad.
[1:21:47] Revelation 3:17.
[1:21:51] Because
[1:21:52] thou sayest, I am rich and increased
[1:21:56] with goods and have need of nothing,
[1:22:00] and knowest not. Now, here's the first
[1:22:03] line was what they think they are.
[1:22:06] But here's what they really are.
[1:22:08] But knowest not that thou art actually
[1:22:11] wretched
[1:22:12] and you're actually miserable
[1:22:14] and you're quite poor. And the reason
[1:22:17] you don't know it is because you're
[1:22:18] blind
[1:22:20] and you're naked.
[1:22:22] See,
[1:22:23] now he he doesn't just I love the fact
[1:22:25] that God doesn't just bring the problem.
[1:22:28] He brings a problem and a remedy.
[1:22:31] And he goes on to say, which we're not
[1:22:33] going to venture into, but he goes on to
[1:22:34] say, I counsel thee buy of me gold. Take
[1:22:37] Isv. I'm going to provide you with
[1:22:39] everything you need to escape this
[1:22:41] horrible condition. This is a horrible
[1:22:44] condition. And brother Brandham said the
[1:22:45] most pitiful part is they're blind. You
[1:22:47] can't tell them. See, they think that
[1:22:49] they are rich. They think that they're
[1:22:51] increased with goods. They they they
[1:22:53] this is their self assessment. I don't
[1:22:56] need anything. And so, of course, if
[1:22:57] they don't need anything, then they
[1:22:58] don't need God. They sure don't need his
[1:23:01] word. They sure don't need a preacher
[1:23:03] yelling at them telling them how to
[1:23:05] live.
[1:23:06] Come on.
[1:23:07] See, you say, "Well, but that's the
[1:23:09] world." No, that's the spirit on the
[1:23:12] world.
[1:23:13] Amen. And you're not immune from that
[1:23:15] spirit trying to talk to you.
[1:23:19] Don't lose that. Don't read that and go,
[1:23:21] "H, that's not me." It is. It is you. If
[1:23:24] you let it, it's up to you to either be
[1:23:26] it or not be it.
[1:23:28] You see? And so, this is the spirit
[1:23:30] that's trying to anoint the world. And
[1:23:33] your seed gene isn't going to protect
[1:23:35] you from that be. And neither will the
[1:23:37] baptism of the Holy Ghost keep the devil
[1:23:39] from whispering it to you and trying to
[1:23:41] influence you. Right?
[1:23:42] Cuz brother Brandham said that's the
[1:23:44] greatest battle ever fought and that in
[1:23:46] the beginning that God and Satan decided
[1:23:48] on a battlefield and it would be the
[1:23:49] mind of man.
[1:23:50] So Satan has a a a legal right to try to
[1:23:54] influence your mind so that you look
[1:23:56] like this. But I'm here to tell you if
[1:23:58] you're a believer of the word, you're
[1:24:00] not supposed to look like this.
[1:24:03] This isn't my heritage. I'm not here to
[1:24:06] think I'm rich when I'm poor. I'm not
[1:24:08] here to think I'm clothed when I'm
[1:24:10] naked. I'm not here for those things.
[1:24:11] I'm here to to fulfill the
[1:24:13] righteousness. I'm going to be clothed
[1:24:16] in pure linen, clean and white.
[1:24:21] Sometimes you just have to shake
[1:24:23] yourself like Samson and shake off the
[1:24:25] devil and shake off the chains. Say,
[1:24:27] "I'm a son of God. What am I doing here?
[1:24:30] I'm marching to Zion. I don't know what
[1:24:32] I was thinking. I'm marching to Zion."
[1:24:36] Sometimes we need to have that happen in
[1:24:38] our lives, friends.
[1:24:44] Brother Brandham talks about this
[1:24:46] lukewarm church
[1:24:48] and the Leodysian church agent the cab
[1:24:50] says.
[1:24:53] You can express it any way you want.
[1:24:57] It all adds up. It all adds up.
[1:24:59] Sugarcoat it how you want.
[1:25:02] Okay. So, well, you know, I got to have
[1:25:05] a career. Sure. Got to have an
[1:25:07] education. Sure. you know, I got to have
[1:25:10] the functions of living. Absolutely.
[1:25:12] Paul, you know, they asked Paul that.
[1:25:15] They said, you know, Paul said, you
[1:25:16] don't have anything to do with the
[1:25:17] world. He writes in his first letter and
[1:25:20] they write him back. And then Paul
[1:25:22] writes his second letter and they said,
[1:25:24] you know, Paul, you you said we
[1:25:26] shouldn't have anything to do with the
[1:25:26] world, but I mean, we go to school, we
[1:25:28] go to the market, we have jobs, you
[1:25:30] know, we work in people's homes. And
[1:25:32] Paul writes them back to say, 'Listen
[1:25:34] concerning what I said to you in the
[1:25:36] first letter. I didn't mean you can go
[1:25:39] out of the world. You can't leave the
[1:25:41] world,
[1:25:42] but what I mean is don't live like
[1:25:44] you're attached to it. Remember, you're
[1:25:46] not of the world.
[1:25:48] Yeah, you're in it. Yeah, sure, you got
[1:25:50] a career and you got an education and
[1:25:52] those are all fine things. And sure, all
[1:25:54] all work and no play makes Johnny a dull
[1:25:56] boy. I'm not saying I'm not saying we
[1:25:58] got to live in a convent. Amen. I I'm
[1:26:01] not saying that, friends. There's
[1:26:03] liberty in Christ.
[1:26:05] Only don't use your liberty as a as a
[1:26:07] way to offend God.
[1:26:10] See,
[1:26:11] there's no sin that can attach itself to
[1:26:13] me. I'm unindictable. I'm the
[1:26:15] unindictable, undefeable child of God.
[1:26:17] But I'm not going to turn grace into
[1:26:19] disgrace.
[1:26:21] The more he gives me, the more I want to
[1:26:23] serve him.
[1:26:25] Amen.
[1:26:28] I'll tell you something, friends. I am
[1:26:30] proving more and more every day in my
[1:26:32] life. The more you can dedicate yourself
[1:26:33] to God, the more power with God you'll
[1:26:35] have.
[1:26:37] Hallelujah.
[1:26:38] And you're going to need it cuz this
[1:26:40] world is burning down.
[1:26:42] And brother Brandham says you can, you
[1:26:44] know, talking about Revelation 3, the
[1:26:46] sad state of Leodysa. You can express it
[1:26:48] in any way you want and it all adds up
[1:26:51] to the fact that the church is
[1:26:54] complacent.
[1:26:56] Amen.
[1:26:57] She is. Here's a couple of either or or
[1:27:00] both. She is satisfied with what she
[1:27:04] has. She either figures she has it all
[1:27:09] or has enough.
[1:27:13] And that's spiritual amnesia.
[1:27:16] If you ever reach a time in your
[1:27:18] Christian walk, if you're sitting here
[1:27:19] today and you know in your heart, I
[1:27:22] don't need you to confess to me, this
[1:27:23] ain't a Catholic church. I you just talk
[1:27:25] to the Lord. I'm tell you something. If
[1:27:28] you're sitting right there and you are
[1:27:29] now comfortable in your spiritual level,
[1:27:32] you have you're in trouble.
[1:27:34] You got a problem. You need to open up
[1:27:37] your heart and say, "Lord God, I need to
[1:27:38] come here today to rise higher, and I'll
[1:27:41] come back next time and go higher. And
[1:27:43] tomorrow morning, I'll be in my recliner
[1:27:45] going higher."
[1:27:49] Amen. Brother Jack and I have that in
[1:27:50] common. I didn't know that till he told
[1:27:52] me. We both got a 5 a.m. chair. We
[1:27:54] talked to the Lord. And I'm here to tell
[1:27:55] you, the Lord talks back.
[1:27:58] I want you to know that the Lord talks
[1:28:00] back.
[1:28:01] You don't just sit in a dark room. You
[1:28:03] start talking. I promise you, he starts
[1:28:06] talking back.
[1:28:08] Hallelujah. I know it by experience.
[1:28:11] He's met me there time after time after
[1:28:14] time.
[1:28:15] Amen.
[1:28:18] I said to a young man here, I was
[1:28:20] counseling a young teenage man here just
[1:28:22] the other day, and I said, "Listen, you
[1:28:25] take brother Jason's word for it. I
[1:28:26] preached this gospel on six of seven
[1:28:28] continents and I have never seen God
[1:28:32] fail to keep his word. And if I told you
[1:28:35] anything else, I'd be fibbing. But he
[1:28:38] always keeps his word if you'll just
[1:28:40] believe it and act upon it.
[1:28:46] She's either satisfied with what she
[1:28:48] has. She either figures she has it all
[1:28:50] or has enough.
[1:28:52] So when Christ descends
[1:28:55] in Revelation 10
[1:28:59] to
[1:29:00] to be united
[1:29:03] with his church
[1:29:05] when he descends in Revelation 10
[1:29:09] to transition
[1:29:11] to to begin the the final the final
[1:29:15] phase, the final process to kick off the
[1:29:20] the last portion
[1:29:22] to complete a full restoration,
[1:29:25] which then takes the Omega church back
[1:29:28] to the apex of where Alpha began to
[1:29:30] decline and backslide. And it takes her
[1:29:33] back to that point and takes her on.
[1:29:35] And we're going to what the Alpha Church
[1:29:37] never made it to, a body change, the
[1:29:40] resurrection of the sleeping, the
[1:29:42] transition of the world into a
[1:29:44] millennium.
[1:29:45] That's where we're at. That's what's
[1:29:48] happening in nature. They can call it
[1:29:49] global warming. They can call it
[1:29:51] whatever they want. I don't admit or
[1:29:52] deny any of it. I just know this and
[1:29:54] say, "Oh, man, this man that." I know
[1:29:56] it's sin.
[1:29:58] But I know God's going to lift the sin.
[1:30:00] And when he lifts the sin, it doesn't
[1:30:02] matter what they've done for 6,000
[1:30:05] years. This millennial world is going to
[1:30:07] be perfect.
[1:30:12] Just like me.
[1:30:14] It didn't matter what kind of background
[1:30:16] I had.
[1:30:17] It didn't matter how I was born. It
[1:30:20] didn't matter how I got cultured or
[1:30:21] socialized or raised or lived under
[1:30:24] misinterpret theology or lived under
[1:30:25] abuse or had this heartbreak or that
[1:30:27] heartbreak. Life's about that. Life's
[1:30:29] not fair. I just can tell you this that
[1:30:31] once he found me, he made me perfect. He
[1:30:35] took away all my past sins and set me on
[1:30:39] high. And now I have full authority
[1:30:42] of heaven behind me in a moment.
[1:30:46] I didn't have to grow into it. It came
[1:30:48] in a moment.
[1:30:51] Not discounting spiritual growth, of
[1:30:53] course.
[1:30:54] Amen.
[1:30:57] But I didn't have to wait.
[1:31:00] When I was born again of the spirit,
[1:31:04] I didn't have to grow to cast out a
[1:31:07] devil.
[1:31:09] My word was as good on the check as his
[1:31:11] word right then and there.
[1:31:14] Amen.
[1:31:14] Amen.
[1:31:16] See, brother Jackie, it didn't matter
[1:31:18] that you were only 19. You come out of
[1:31:20] that fasting, you had power with God.
[1:31:22] Hallelujah.
[1:31:24] Doesn't matter. You young men, you young
[1:31:26] sisters.
[1:31:27] You can have power with God right now.
[1:31:30] Right now in this service, you don't
[1:31:32] even have to wait till it's over. You
[1:31:34] can have it right now. Why don't you
[1:31:36] raise up hand and say, "I'll I'll take
[1:31:37] it. I'll receive it right now."
[1:31:41] Hallelujah.
[1:31:43] Thank you, Lord.
[1:31:43] Amen.
[1:31:45] Praise God.
[1:31:47] Amen.
[1:31:48] When Christ descended in Revelation 10
[1:31:50] to transition all creation to begin the
[1:31:53] final phase
[1:31:55] of his redemptive plan,
[1:31:58] transition the earth back to a
[1:32:00] millennium when he descended to kick
[1:32:02] that off.
[1:32:04] He finds the last day earth in a
[1:32:06] catastrophe.
[1:32:08] In a catastrophe.
[1:32:11] lukewarmness and coldness and forms of
[1:32:15] godliness are everywhere.
[1:32:18] All Christianity, the He goes to their
[1:32:21] tables to have communion. But the Bible
[1:32:24] says their tables are full of vomit.
[1:32:27] Amen.
[1:32:29] And like a a a hog to its wallow, like a
[1:32:33] dog to its vomit. That's the way the
[1:32:35] church has all become man-made creed and
[1:32:38] formal uh religion.
[1:32:42] And there's there's no purity anywhere.
[1:32:45] There's no clean place anywhere. And and
[1:32:48] a church, not only could she not go in a
[1:32:52] rapture, she couldn't get any better.
[1:32:55] She couldn't improve. As I've said to
[1:32:56] you so many times, that's about as bad
[1:32:58] as you can possibly get when you already
[1:33:01] don't qualify and you can't improve.
[1:33:04] Amen.
[1:33:05] I mean, you're you're talking about a
[1:33:07] Gordian knot, a hopeless conundrum.
[1:33:09] You're there. There there's no chance.
[1:33:11] You don't even have a chance
[1:33:13] because you you can't go like you are
[1:33:15] and you can't get any better. I'm here
[1:33:17] to tell you, he wasn't going to come
[1:33:19] down and try to renovate an old fallen
[1:33:23] Horus church. He was going to he saw
[1:33:26] inside of there that there were still
[1:33:28] gene seed of God and he would call them
[1:33:31] out of there like he called Israel out
[1:33:34] of a nation. He would call a bride out
[1:33:37] by his word and she would become the
[1:33:40] spotless bride of the lamb. She would be
[1:33:43] him in the earth.
[1:33:46] Amen.
[1:33:49] You know, I started making this point
[1:33:52] Wednesday and I I think I didn't finish
[1:33:53] it and I want to finish it today. It's
[1:33:55] not a a great long point, but Chris and
[1:33:59] I in our Chris and I go to church in the
[1:34:03] mornings and exercise breaks out.
[1:34:08] Amen, Gibb. We go to We go to church. I
[1:34:12] said, "Chris, you're going to meet me at
[1:34:13] church? You going to meet me at the
[1:34:14] bridge?" "Yeah, Dad. Nine bells. Let's
[1:34:16] go." So, we go to church and exercise
[1:34:18] breaks out while we're there.
[1:34:23] And we were talking about this the other
[1:34:25] day, several days ago, and we just
[1:34:27] started talking about life. And we both
[1:34:29] agreed. We both agreed wholeheartedly.
[1:34:33] What is the point of life
[1:34:35] if you don't secure eternal life?
[1:34:39] What's the point?
[1:34:41] Then then just eat, drink, and be
[1:34:42] married for tomorrow we all die.
[1:34:46] I I mean this is what Paul said. If it's
[1:34:47] no hope in the resurrection, I'm above
[1:34:49] all men most miserable.
[1:34:51] I mean, goodness, if if I don't invite
[1:34:54] me over to eat and spread a seven course
[1:34:57] wonderful gourmet meal in front of me
[1:34:59] and say you can look at it, but you
[1:35:00] can't eat it.
[1:35:01] I'd rather not come over. I'd rather not
[1:35:04] smell the aroma.
[1:35:06] See? And so Paul is now carried to the
[1:35:09] third heaven and sees all these things.
[1:35:11] And now Paul is saying, "Wow, now that
[1:35:13] I've seen what I've seen, if there's no
[1:35:15] resurrection, I above all men
[1:35:18] say, you're going to be miserable. You
[1:35:20] have no idea.
[1:35:22] I went to the third heaven. Trust me,
[1:35:24] you have no idea what God has in store
[1:35:27] for those that love him.
[1:35:30] Oh my. If I if all he come to tell me
[1:35:33] was this wonderful word and and I could
[1:35:35] eat upon it, but if it can't give me
[1:35:37] eternal life because I'd rather not know
[1:35:40] it cuz it's going to make me crave
[1:35:41] eternal life. Once I read about God and
[1:35:43] his heaven and his plan, I want to be
[1:35:45] there. I want to be a part of it.
[1:35:48] Hallelujah.
[1:35:50] Amen.
[1:35:51] And that's why people people commit
[1:35:53] suicide. We were talking about that
[1:35:54] Wednesday night is I almost become
[1:35:56] socially cool among teenagers to take
[1:35:59] your own life in which I said you
[1:36:01] actually can't take your life because
[1:36:02] your life don't end
[1:36:04] and that's what no one's telling them.
[1:36:06] Those Hollywood producers aren't telling
[1:36:08] them oh actually you don't die.
[1:36:11] Cuz no one's ever yet died.
[1:36:14] No, people's bodies have stopped
[1:36:16] functioning. But the person that was
[1:36:18] them is is bound over for trial
[1:36:20] in a place called hell
[1:36:22] where you're bound over for trial
[1:36:24] and or you're in the land of the
[1:36:26] redeemed.
[1:36:28] Say, "What about purgatory?" I said,
[1:36:30] "I'm in it.
[1:36:31] I'm between heaven and hell right now."
[1:36:34] And since the lid has torn torn from
[1:36:36] hell and demon powers are streaming into
[1:36:39] the earth, I just say, "Hell has come to
[1:36:41] the surface. I'm in purgatory right now.
[1:36:43] Hallelujah friends. And I'm not looking
[1:36:45] to stay here. I'm looking to go there.
[1:36:48] Hallelujah.
[1:36:52] So, you know, because people get so
[1:36:54] decided dissatisfi dissatisfied with
[1:36:56] life,
[1:36:57] then what's the point? And I mean
[1:36:59] millionaires,
[1:37:01] multiple millionaires,
[1:37:03] even billionaires, they hang themselves
[1:37:05] in closets.
[1:37:06] Amen.
[1:37:08] What?
[1:37:10] Man, if I had your money, I'd live it
[1:37:11] up. Don't be so sure.
[1:37:15] Don't be so sure.
[1:37:17] Bible talks about it being rich as being
[1:37:18] a torment
[1:37:20] cuz then you worry about how to keep it
[1:37:21] and you worry about somebody stealing it
[1:37:23] and you worry I mean you know and and
[1:37:25] then it sets up this this lust that you
[1:37:29] can't suppress. And they asked
[1:37:31] Rockefeller, "Goodness, you got so much.
[1:37:33] How much is enough?" And he said, "A
[1:37:34] little more than I got."
[1:37:37] Well, how much do you want? More than I
[1:37:38] have. But you already got so much. Yeah,
[1:37:40] but I need more. You already got more
[1:37:42] than you can spend
[1:37:43] in a hundred lifetimes.
[1:37:45] Yeah.
[1:37:46] But you don't realize that's that's the
[1:37:48] pipe piper. That's that's Satan. It's
[1:37:50] Eden. It
[1:37:51] it's it's drawing you to a destruction.
[1:37:55] Amen.
[1:37:57] And people realize that wealth doesn't
[1:37:59] give it to them. Fortune and glory. In
[1:38:01] fact is the ones who get the most famous
[1:38:02] and get the richest when they're
[1:38:04] suddenly not famous anymore.
[1:38:06] That's when they take their own life or
[1:38:08] attempt to.
[1:38:09] Amen.
[1:38:10] See, so because they can't answer the
[1:38:13] question,
[1:38:15] what's the point of life? And and that's
[1:38:17] the question that you I mean, it's
[1:38:18] almost a cliche. What's the meaning of
[1:38:20] life?
[1:38:22] I'm so glad I have the devil's answer
[1:38:24] before he ever thought of the question.
[1:38:27] What is the point of life if you don't
[1:38:30] obtain
[1:38:31] eternal life?
[1:38:35] Say, well, to to get riches, it's all
[1:38:37] going to ash and cinder. Amen. Amen.
[1:38:40] Well, to be famous, it's all going to
[1:38:41] ash and cinder.
[1:38:43] Well, I I want to have things. I want to
[1:38:45] I want to I want to have freedom. There
[1:38:47] is no freedom outside of Christ.
[1:38:49] The only the only the the freedom you're
[1:38:51] believing in is a taskmaster that hates
[1:38:53] you and wants to kill you.
[1:38:56] See
[1:39:02] the evolving purpose
[1:39:05] of the dance. And I'm not speaking of
[1:39:07] any dance in particular, just dance as a
[1:39:09] general category.
[1:39:12] They have evidence
[1:39:14] of dance records dated all the way back
[1:39:17] to the ancient Egyptians.
[1:39:20] Mankind has been using dance
[1:39:22] in an expression
[1:39:25] and it has come forward. And I'm not
[1:39:26] going to take the time for a history
[1:39:28] lesson today. It was fascinating to me,
[1:39:29] but I'm not going to bore you with it.
[1:39:32] But but you know, it came all the way
[1:39:34] from centuries BCE all the way up to the
[1:39:37] time of Christ and and and all the way
[1:39:39] into into after Christ. And and we find
[1:39:43] that, you know, it comes up, they find
[1:39:45] uh during the Renaissance, now I'm
[1:39:47] jumping. Now I'm jumping centuries and
[1:39:49] centuries even millennium millenniums.
[1:39:52] And so during the Renaissance um dances
[1:39:55] were recorded through a simple form of
[1:39:59] verbal abbreviation. And so in other
[1:40:01] words um they they tried to improve with
[1:40:05] with progress because it's the tree of
[1:40:07] knowledge of good and evil.
[1:40:08] Amen.
[1:40:09] So they're always trying to improve it.
[1:40:11] Improve it. Improve it. How can we make
[1:40:13] the connection of expression in dance
[1:40:15] easier, better, slicker, more powerful,
[1:40:18] more expressive to give a message?
[1:40:20] Because that's what dance is. It's a
[1:40:21] message.
[1:40:22] Amen.
[1:40:23] Right. So that that's why that Satan
[1:40:26] takes young people out and puts them in
[1:40:29] a club and plays wild music which is
[1:40:32] going to make your body move because
[1:40:33] your body responds to those rhythms and
[1:40:35] percussions.
[1:40:36] That's music. Remember friends that
[1:40:38] music was not in the original creation.
[1:40:40] Music pre predates the creation. See,
[1:40:43] music was already in heaven.
[1:40:45] Worship was already in heaven when God
[1:40:47] created the heavens and the earth. So,
[1:40:49] so we find that it predates, let me say,
[1:40:51] it predates the creation of the earth to
[1:40:53] be more clear. So, it already existed in
[1:40:56] heaven. So, that so music is has a
[1:40:59] supernatural quality to it. That's
[1:41:01] that's why when you hear certain music,
[1:41:03] it'll put you in a certain mood.
[1:41:05] You hear they call it toetapping.
[1:41:07] There's a reason. You'll snap your
[1:41:09] fingers. You'll drive down the road and
[1:41:10] tap on the steering wheel. You'll bob
[1:41:12] your head and hope nobody saw you do
[1:41:14] that.
[1:41:16] What was wrong with this crazy guy?
[1:41:18] That's the power of music. It it
[1:41:19] actually you feel it. Brother Brandham
[1:41:22] describes that, you know, and when he's
[1:41:23] talking about, you know, I'm not going
[1:41:25] into it today. We've preached on it
[1:41:26] before, but brother talks about it in in
[1:41:28] Masterpiece and and and Shalom and
[1:41:30] different places, some of my favorite
[1:41:32] sermons about how that these wonderful
[1:41:34] pieces of music, you know, here that you
[1:41:37] know, here here is here is uh you know
[1:41:41] uh these great and this and and for many
[1:41:43] of those composers, this was their
[1:41:44] church m this was their gospel music. It
[1:41:47] was worship handles Messiah. It's he's
[1:41:49] worshiping his god.
[1:41:51] And so so we find that brother Brandham
[1:41:54] said that it has such a power and this
[1:41:56] is how a prophet describes it. He said
[1:41:58] to you can just close your eyes and live
[1:42:02] in it
[1:42:04] and you just you're gone somewhere and
[1:42:06] you're just with your eyes closed and
[1:42:08] you're swaying and imagery is coming
[1:42:10] before your mind and and if it's a
[1:42:12] particularly worshipful song tears will
[1:42:15] start to roll down your face. You know,
[1:42:17] somebody didn't tell you a sad story.
[1:42:19] The music is doing it to you.
[1:42:22] You know, and and sometimes if we we you
[1:42:25] know, we get in here, you know, on a
[1:42:27] Wednesday night, you people come in,
[1:42:28] you're tired, you're you're beat down
[1:42:30] from the day, and Anthony understands
[1:42:33] that this is the time to come out and
[1:42:35] sing something snappy, get your blood
[1:42:37] moving, get your hands clapping, get
[1:42:38] your toes tapping. He'll come out with
[1:42:40] some big jubilee, and next thing you
[1:42:42] know, you're not tired anymore.
[1:42:44] See? And and so it's just it's just all
[1:42:47] about understanding the science of
[1:42:49] rhythm and music.
[1:42:51] And so they by the time you get to the
[1:42:54] 17th century now, they've come through
[1:42:55] the Renaissance. They're they've made it
[1:42:57] a form of verbal abbreviation with one
[1:42:59] letter standing uh for each individual
[1:43:01] step in the dance. by the time they get
[1:43:03] to the 17th century, uh, the increasing,
[1:43:06] you know, they're increasingly trying to
[1:43:08] make these complex floor patterns and
[1:43:11] and have certain types of dances, you
[1:43:14] know, particularly those of the court
[1:43:15] ballets, which which led to the
[1:43:17] emergence of actually what they call
[1:43:19] track drawing systems. So, you
[1:43:21] understand the tree of knowledge is just
[1:43:23] adding.
[1:43:24] It's growing. The understanding of it is
[1:43:26] growing. By the time you get to the 19th
[1:43:29] century, subsequent ballet masters
[1:43:31] turned to a form of what they called
[1:43:33] notation using stick figures. So that
[1:43:36] sounds pretty simple. Actually, they're
[1:43:37] making it more brilliant.
[1:43:40] By the time you come into the 20th
[1:43:43] century, uh you know, choreology and had
[1:43:47] developed and and here's a man or here's
[1:43:49] two people, a lady and a man Joan and
[1:43:52] Rudolph uh Benesh. in the 20th century.
[1:43:55] You know, now dance is based on a more
[1:43:57] clearly visual rather than symbolic form
[1:44:02] of notation. Now, catch that dance was
[1:44:05] always symbolism. They had certain
[1:44:08] movements that that's why I said they
[1:44:11] get these young people in these clubs
[1:44:13] dancing to this wild boogie woogie
[1:44:15] music. It's not worship. It's not
[1:44:17] expression. It's just vulgarity.
[1:44:20] It has no original purpose in dance.
[1:44:24] Dance dance was a language.
[1:44:26] Dance. David danced before the Lord with
[1:44:29] all his might.
[1:44:31] See, now his wife McCall didn't like
[1:44:33] that dance cuz it was a godly dance.
[1:44:36] She probably wouldn't have mind it had
[1:44:38] he danced some worldly jig. But he's
[1:44:40] dancing to bring forth Jehovah, which to
[1:44:42] the world probably looked pretty crazy.
[1:44:45] It probably didn't look like, man,
[1:44:46] that's not a cool dance at all. to God
[1:44:49] to God. It was David was worshiping. It
[1:44:52] was a language God was speaking
[1:44:54] that David was speaking to God.
[1:44:58] He was inspired.
[1:45:00] But by the time you get to the 20th
[1:45:01] century, does that surprise you?
[1:45:04] Right? As Leodysia comes on the scene,
[1:45:06] by the time you get midway through n the
[1:45:08] 20th century, dance is now more more
[1:45:12] visual rather than symbolic form of
[1:45:15] notation. And it's all about, you know,
[1:45:18] vulgarity and vulgar moves and who can
[1:45:20] do the most vulgar moves until it
[1:45:22] becomes so vulgar. It it's it's it's
[1:45:25] even embarrassing to a man and a woman
[1:45:27] in the privacy of their home, even
[1:45:29] married.
[1:45:31] Some of those dance moves that they've
[1:45:33] created today should not even be done
[1:45:35] among married couples. It's filth.
[1:45:38] It's a spirit of perversion.
[1:45:40] It was never what dance was supposed to
[1:45:42] be.
[1:45:43] Dance is supposed to Let me say this,
[1:45:45] friends. Your lifestyle to God is a
[1:45:48] dance.
[1:45:50] Your church attendance is a dance.
[1:45:53] You don't got to be jumping, running, or
[1:45:55] swaying or jigging. It's about the voice
[1:45:57] of your lived life. It's a harmony.
[1:46:00] Brother Benham talks about the harmony
[1:46:02] of the composer. And now the orchestra,
[1:46:05] we're in harmony with him. And when he
[1:46:07] he has a certain idea and we absorb
[1:46:10] that. And when the heaven plays it, we
[1:46:12] play it. When heaven sounds it, we sound
[1:46:15] it in the earth.
[1:46:24] In fact is
[1:46:27] this is why remember in brother
[1:46:29] Brandham's vision of the church part of
[1:46:32] the catastrophe
[1:46:34] he found the church
[1:46:37] of every
[1:46:38] of every culture
[1:46:42] dancing
[1:46:43] following a witch.
[1:46:47] who was full herself of whoredoms
[1:46:49] because she was nude
[1:46:51] from the waist up
[1:46:53] and she was she you know which is such a
[1:46:58] a slap in the face to El Shadi
[1:47:01] who is the breasted God
[1:47:03] who provided that to give Abraham
[1:47:05] sustenance to change his life.
[1:47:08] Oh, and here's a church feeding their
[1:47:10] children poison
[1:47:12] and expecting a body change. You're
[1:47:14] never going to get a body change feeding
[1:47:16] off the poisons of the world.
[1:47:20] And we find that she's dancing and
[1:47:22] brother Ram says dancing to the beat of
[1:47:24] rock and roll.
[1:47:27] Would to God it had only stayed rock and
[1:47:29] roll. Now it's so many different genres
[1:47:31] and varieties and every kind of social
[1:47:33] media contact. I tell you something
[1:47:35] parents, you should be careful what you
[1:47:38] allow your children to participate in.
[1:47:41] Say, "Well, I got to let them be them."
[1:47:43] You got to raise them in the ways of the
[1:47:45] Lord.
[1:47:46] You got to train them up. It's amazing
[1:47:48] to me people can train animals.
[1:47:51] And your child is the most intelligent
[1:47:52] animal ever ever created. And no one
[1:47:55] trains a child.
[1:47:57] They train dogs.
[1:47:59] They'll train horses and dolphins and
[1:48:00] monkeys. Nobody will train a child.
[1:48:02] And a child has a free moral age and has
[1:48:04] a mind and can reason. He's the easiest
[1:48:06] to train.
[1:48:08] Amen.
[1:48:08] And nobody will train their ch their
[1:48:10] children. They think their duty is just
[1:48:12] to house them, shelter them, feed them,
[1:48:14] clothe them, protect them. Your duty is
[1:48:16] to train them up in the ways of the
[1:48:18] Lord. Your duty is to be say, "Well,
[1:48:21] they're just going to have to have the
[1:48:22] Holy Ghost, right? That's you until they
[1:48:24] get him."
[1:48:25] Amen.
[1:48:26] Amen.
[1:48:26] Oh, that might have hit a brick wall,
[1:48:28] but I'm going to say it again, parents.
[1:48:30] That's you until they get him.
[1:48:34] See?
[1:48:35] Oh, I got to I got to hurry.
[1:48:38] You still good?
[1:48:41] Thank you, brother Rich.
[1:48:43] So, in fact is that many of the terms
[1:48:47] used in reference to dance rhythms such
[1:48:49] as tempo and dynamics and beat are are
[1:48:51] derived from music. See, and and and and
[1:48:56] at most and this is this is this is a
[1:48:58] reading from a learned scholar. And at
[1:49:00] most dance is either set to music or
[1:49:02] accompanied by it. In fact is this
[1:49:05] expert calls it he's a he's a instructor
[1:49:08] and a and a professor of it. It's he
[1:49:11] calls music the most important element
[1:49:15] of dance is music.
[1:49:17] Amen.
[1:49:18] See and he talks about it's rare for
[1:49:21] dance of any kind social theatrical
[1:49:23] religious to develop without musical
[1:49:26] accompaniment. So there's this close
[1:49:28] relation between dance and music. And
[1:49:31] it's based on the fact that both are
[1:49:34] organized around rhythmic patterns.
[1:49:38] So now this is nature.
[1:49:40] Say, "Oh, you're giving us a science
[1:49:41] lesson." I'm not. I'm giving you a
[1:49:43] lesson on nature.
[1:49:44] This is how God built you. This is why
[1:49:46] rhythm and beat and music move your
[1:49:48] body.
[1:49:49] See? And so, so we find out then that
[1:49:53] it's all organized around rhythmic
[1:49:54] pattern. Thus, the rhythm of the
[1:49:56] accompanying music may be used to
[1:49:57] determine the rhythm of the dance to
[1:49:59] give it emphasis or to help the dancers
[1:50:01] maintain the same beat. And that's
[1:50:02] important. In fact, it's nearly Now,
[1:50:05] think about this. I'm I'm going to go to
[1:50:07] another gear. Nearly all physical
[1:50:10] activity
[1:50:11] is done rhythmically.
[1:50:15] beating of your heart,
[1:50:17] the flow of your breath,
[1:50:20] walking and running,
[1:50:22] work activities such as digging, sawing,
[1:50:24] scrubbing. You all know they work on the
[1:50:27] railroad, singing. Men saw big trees,
[1:50:30] singing. Sometimes people are chopping
[1:50:32] wood, singing. What? What? What? What
[1:50:34] are what are they doing? Sometimes
[1:50:35] people exercise to music
[1:50:38] because it's a rhythm. It and it keeps
[1:50:40] them going. In fact, as they talk about,
[1:50:42] and I I don't want to labor labor you
[1:50:44] with all this reading, but they talk
[1:50:46] about it actually can improve your
[1:50:48] endurance because it makes you even. So,
[1:50:50] you don't just jump in and wear yourself
[1:50:51] out. You've got a you've got a rhythm
[1:50:53] and a sync to your workout and you you
[1:50:55] can go a long time. People on the on the
[1:50:57] dance floor, people in discos, uh, or or
[1:50:59] clubs, nightclubs, they can dance a lot
[1:51:02] longer because they're moving to the
[1:51:03] rhythm of the music and they're not just
[1:51:05] blowing it all out the stack.
[1:51:07] See what I'm saying?
[1:51:09] So now friends, I I just want you to put
[1:51:11] on your spiritual thinking caps for a
[1:51:13] minute. What does this mean to us? When
[1:51:15] brother Brandham talks about the spirit
[1:51:17] of the composer and the music that is to
[1:51:20] be the word of God and you supposed to
[1:51:22] have a life that's a heavenly dance to
[1:51:24] him in in in in not only in celebration
[1:51:27] of him, but in in awe and worship and
[1:51:31] you're declaring to the world who you
[1:51:33] really love and who you really believe.
[1:51:38] I'll skip over the rest of it. They they
[1:51:40] go on to all kinds of more complex
[1:51:42] scales and and and how that and how that
[1:51:45] even they even write dancers are
[1:51:47] assigned sometimes to to specific
[1:51:49] instruments and they're choreographed in
[1:51:51] such a manner and this is beautiful that
[1:51:54] often times the dancer and the music are
[1:51:58] choreographed in such a manner that they
[1:52:00] duplicate on stage the relationship
[1:52:02] among the instruments and the orchestra.
[1:52:05] So in other words, the dancer becomes an
[1:52:08] extended expression of the orchestra.
[1:52:11] Amen.
[1:52:12] Now, now you're talking about Christ and
[1:52:14] his bride.
[1:52:15] Christ is playing a melody of his word
[1:52:17] and we become the dance. We become the
[1:52:20] expression, the the the the orchestra is
[1:52:23] not even sometimes they're out of sight.
[1:52:25] It's the it's the dancer on the stage
[1:52:27] that everybody's throwing the roses at.
[1:52:29] I'm here to tell you something, friends.
[1:52:31] There might be people who will never
[1:52:33] hear the trumpet sound of this, but they
[1:52:34] might hear it through you.
[1:52:36] They might never pick up this book. They
[1:52:38] might never turn on a tape, but they can
[1:52:40] see the harmonic rhythm. They can see
[1:52:43] the melody of heaven lived out in mine
[1:52:47] and your lives.
[1:52:50] Oh, it goes on and on and on. I could
[1:52:52] just carry on.
[1:52:55] They talk about social dance almost
[1:52:58] always accompanied by music.
[1:53:00] And here's what it here's what here's
[1:53:02] what the modern listen now here's what
[1:53:04] modern music and dance is set to
[1:53:07] accomplish. Here's its 21st century
[1:53:10] goal. All right, you ready?
[1:53:13] Amen.
[1:53:14] And there's a great spiritual type on
[1:53:16] the other side.
[1:53:18] The whole thing of this day is to
[1:53:22] encourage the dancers
[1:53:25] to abandon themselves to their
[1:53:28] movements.
[1:53:31] Amen.
[1:53:32] To abandon themselves. That's what
[1:53:35] worldly music, friends, you young
[1:53:38] people, that's all Tik Tok is about.
[1:53:41] That's all social media is about. is to
[1:53:44] get you to abandon your movements. To
[1:53:46] abandon yourselves to your movements and
[1:53:50] march and dance and swing and bop and
[1:53:53] sing and live and act away that doesn't
[1:53:56] come from here.
[1:53:59] But there is one that comes from here.
[1:54:01] Hallelujah. That's the one I'm dancing
[1:54:04] to today. That's the one I want in my
[1:54:07] life. That's the one I want to give
[1:54:09] myself over to. I want to I want my life
[1:54:12] to be the rhythm of the word. As brother
[1:54:14] Brandham saw her said she was marching
[1:54:16] to the step of the gospel.
[1:54:19] Hallelujah. Something like onward.
[1:54:21] Christian soldiers. How many Christian
[1:54:25] soldiers are here today who say onward
[1:54:28] and not just onward, onward and upward.
[1:54:35] Hallelujah.
[1:54:39] It's a great opportunity. I was thinking
[1:54:42] about this morning as I was sitting in
[1:54:45] my early morning chair and I was up a
[1:54:49] little bit late, probably six maybe cuz
[1:54:51] I had been sick and didn't feel good and
[1:54:54] I'd slept in an extra hour and
[1:54:58] I thought about the opportunity to spend
[1:55:00] time with the Lord to start to start my
[1:55:02] day. I want to tell you something,
[1:55:04] friends. There's nothing like starting
[1:55:06] your day with some spiritual
[1:55:09] nourishment.
[1:55:12] You know, and to socialize a little bit
[1:55:14] with God.
[1:55:15] Can I use that modern term? There's
[1:55:18] nothing like early morning socializing
[1:55:20] with God.
[1:55:21] Oh my God. Let me tell you something.
[1:55:24] Let me tell you something, teenagers.
[1:55:25] God has a Facebook.
[1:55:26] Amen.
[1:55:28] Amen. God has a word that you're to gaze
[1:55:31] at and see what you really are made of.
[1:55:34] And God can sit there at that time and
[1:55:36] really begin to bring out in you what
[1:55:38] you're lacking and what you need. Say,
[1:55:40] "Oh, do I want to hear that? You want to
[1:55:42] hear that above everything? You want to
[1:55:43] hear that if you don't ever hear
[1:55:44] anything else again in your life, you
[1:55:47] want to hear that.
[1:55:49] But you have to understand that Satan
[1:55:51] doesn't want that to happen."
[1:55:54] Now, I'm coming to my real burden today.
[1:55:59] Satan doesn't want that to happen.
[1:56:04] He wants as soon as he can to draw you
[1:56:07] away from that.
[1:56:09] Amen.
[1:56:10] Get you feeding on the tree of knowledge
[1:56:12] and all of its worldly poisons.
[1:56:16] You know, get you to first thing out of
[1:56:18] your bed and you know, as soon before
[1:56:20] you open your Bible, you're opening your
[1:56:22] phone.
[1:56:24] before you're talking to God, you're
[1:56:27] checking your mail.
[1:56:29] And all the while, the Lord, like a
[1:56:31] gentleman, is just sitting there quietly
[1:56:33] waiting on you.
[1:56:38] I said, "Lord, don't ever let me be
[1:56:40] guilty of that. Let me come into your
[1:56:43] house." Say, "I thought it was your
[1:56:44] living room." It is. It's his house. I
[1:56:46] want to come into his presence with my
[1:56:48] hands up and say, "Oh God, have mercy on
[1:56:51] me this day, Lord God. Oh, I'll get to
[1:56:54] my email. I'll figure out who texted me.
[1:56:56] I'll get I'll get there. It doesn't
[1:56:58] matter. I'm always somebody's needing
[1:57:00] something. But but but but I I but I
[1:57:03] need him.
[1:57:04] I need him.
[1:57:06] And and Satan Satan doesn't want that.
[1:57:08] He wants you immediately feeding on the
[1:57:10] tree of knowledge and worldly poisons.
[1:57:13] Right.
[1:57:14] Amen.
[1:57:14] And there the dance begins.
[1:57:18] Amen.
[1:57:19] Amen. There's where the dance begins.
[1:57:25] And your decision is who is my partner.
[1:57:29] Amen.
[1:57:30] Today,
[1:57:32] I got more to say, but the Lord's
[1:57:34] prompting me just to stop right here.
[1:57:37] Who is your dance partner?
[1:57:40] Today, friends, I want you to think
[1:57:43] about that deeply.
[1:57:45] Who do you who do you want for a dance
[1:57:49] partner?
[1:57:50] Ask yourselves that question humbly. Bow
[1:57:53] your heads with me. Musicians, quietly
[1:57:56] make your way to the platform. Anthony,
[1:57:57] bring come with your team
[1:58:03] while every head is bowed and
[1:58:06] every
[1:58:08] eye is closed. Now just people holding
[1:58:12] positions coming to their place.
[1:58:15] Don't be looking around. Don't be
[1:58:16] distracted.
[1:58:20] I want you to think as they prepare
[1:58:23] whatever you're going to go with.
[1:58:25] Brother Ken, just just while they are
[1:58:28] preparing now, I want it deeply on your
[1:58:32] mind and your heart right now. Say,
[1:58:34] "Lord,
[1:58:37] what's the real desire in my heart?
[1:58:41] Don't let me
[1:58:43] continue to think I'm okay if I'm not.
[1:58:47] Don't let me There's no deception worse
[1:58:50] than selfdeception. It's the worst
[1:58:52] deception in creation is selfdeception."
[1:58:56] Say, "Lord, have I let my life get so
[1:58:58] busy?" Be honest now. Be honest with
[1:59:00] God. Have I let my life get so busy?
[1:59:03] your hands. I haven't even asked for
[1:59:05] hands. Hands are already going up. Have
[1:59:07] I let my life get so busy, Lord? Have I
[1:59:11] allowed the the the wrong conductor in
[1:59:14] my life?
[1:59:16] Where am I at, Lord? What kind of what
[1:59:18] kind of dance is my life? Why don't you
[1:59:21] stand to your feet with me, friends? And
[1:59:25] if you feel in your heart today that
[1:59:27] this word has spoken to you deep in your
[1:59:29] heart, why don't you raise up, join me
[1:59:31] and raise up those hands and say, "Lord
[1:59:33] God, oh let my life be a dance of the
[1:59:37] royal court. Let my life, oh God, be
[1:59:41] under your control of your rhythm and
[1:59:43] your beat and your sheet music.
[1:59:47] Let my life, oh lamb of God.
[1:59:51] Let my life be be played out to the
[1:59:55] sheet music of the word.
[1:59:57] The word that you've sent in this day,
[1:59:59] this wonderful, glorious word. You found
[2:00:02] the earth in a catastrophe. You called
[2:00:05] me out of it. You called me to serve
[2:00:06] you. You called me to worship you. But
[2:00:09] not just worship you. You called me to
[2:00:12] worship in spirit and truth.
[2:00:16] forms of godliness you have no use for.
[2:00:19] None. You don't even want them. You even
[2:00:21] told Israel, "Don't even bring me that
[2:00:23] kind of offering. I don't even want it.
[2:00:24] I won't receive it."
[2:00:28] What you want is a sincere heart
[2:00:32] that will come to God in an honest way.
[2:00:35] Say, "Lord, I need you today."
[2:00:38] Oh, both of my hands are up again. Lord,
[2:00:41] I need you today.
[2:00:43] Oh, come Lord God. You saw I had more in
[2:00:46] my notes. I'm sure I'll catch it at
[2:00:48] another time. It's still burning on me.
[2:00:50] But I I just felt led of the spirit of
[2:00:52] God to just ask the people right now.
[2:00:56] What's your dance?
[2:00:59] What did your dance begin as today? What
[2:01:02] will it be tomorrow? Monday morning when
[2:01:05] you wake up, teenager,
[2:01:07] what will be your dance?
[2:01:10] Brother, sister, when you're at work,
[2:01:14] young people, when you're at school,
[2:01:18] there's going to be all kinds of dances
[2:01:20] going on around you. Which one are you
[2:01:21] going to dance?
[2:01:24] What's your decision? The king is
[2:01:26] waiting to hear your answer. He's
[2:01:28] waiting to hear your answer.
[2:01:31] I tell you, in the name of the Lord
[2:01:33] anointing me now, the king is waiting on
[2:01:35] your answer.
[2:01:38] What will you say to him?
[2:01:43] If you can't muster the courage to
[2:01:45] commit to his dance, then just say this.
[2:01:49] God, be merciful to me, a sinner.
[2:01:54] Oh, I promise you, you just start right
[2:01:56] there and he'll give you the dance.
[2:01:58] He'll give you the kind of music that
[2:02:00] you need.
[2:02:02] Oh, lamb of God.
[2:02:05] Perhaps we didn't come today expecting
[2:02:07] this kind of a finish. I know I didn't.
[2:02:10] But I know you're here right now. And I
[2:02:13] know you're dealing not only with our
[2:02:14] hearts, you're dealing with my heart. Oh
[2:02:16] God, you're calling me higher. You're
[2:02:18] calling us all higher. I believe your
[2:02:21] coming is so soon.
[2:02:24] I wanted to go through the word today
[2:02:26] and so prove that. But perhaps you've
[2:02:28] got it for another time. back. If there
[2:02:30] is another time, if I never get another
[2:02:32] chance and this is my last sermon and
[2:02:35] the rapture comes, then let the world
[2:02:38] know.
[2:02:39] But I left the earth saying, "Lord, I
[2:02:41] want more of you. I want more of you."
[2:02:44] That'll be the last will and testament
[2:02:45] of Jason Watkins. That's the last thing
[2:02:47] we heard him say. That's the last dance
[2:02:49] we saw.
[2:02:52] He danced, "I want more of you, Lord."
[2:02:56] That was the cry of his heart.
[2:02:59] I pray you'll grant it to us today. Sing
[2:03:02] for us, brother Ken.
[2:03:06] [Music]
[2:03:09] Oh, make it personal.
[2:03:12] Make it real personal
