[0:00] father Lord we come before you this
[0:02] morning humbly inviting you into our
[0:04] little Sunday school this morning Lord
[0:06] we ask that You' meet us here father
[0:09] that this little thought of my heart
[0:11] might help somebody make some
[0:15] encouragement
[0:17] might Comfort The Afflicted and maybe
[0:20] afflict the comfortable a
[0:21] little Lord give us an encouragement
[0:25] to always hold to your promise of
[0:29] salvation always hold to your promise
[0:32] of all your promises in the word Lord
[0:35] that without you we could do nothing
[0:38] father we ask you would
[0:39] Grant inspiration to the word that we're
[0:42] going to read father that though we may
[0:45] have words on a page that the letter
[0:47] alone would just kill us father but your
[0:50] spirit would bring life so we ask that
[0:53] you would bring us revelation of the
[0:56] word as we would read it this
[0:57] morning and to invite you into our
[1:00] Sunday school that you would move on the
[1:02] hearts of the people that you'd be with
[1:04] us throughout not just the Sunday school
[1:05] but the worship service and then into
[1:07] the into the main service Lord that our
[1:10] hearts would be open and that the needs
[1:12] of the people would be met we ask these
[1:14] things in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:15] Christ
[1:17] amen um I want to turn this morning for
[1:19] a text to uh St John chapter
[1:27] 14 and we're going to go to verse 6
[1:33] 16 John chap 14 and verse
[1:41] 16 all right I'm going to read here it
[1:45] says and I will pray the father and he
[1:48] shall give you another comforter that he
[1:50] may abide with you forever amen you all
[1:54] can have your
[1:55] seats um I want to take a title this
[1:58] morning
[2:00] um it's a little bit of a I admit a
[2:03] little bit of a tongue and- cheek kind
[2:04] of a title called good people go to
[2:08] heaven and you know we you hear this a
[2:11] lot it's kind of a cliche almost and
[2:13] almost you know especially in you know
[2:17] properly uh taught Christians you know
[2:20] this idea of oh will good people go to
[2:22] heaven you know it's really not that
[2:24] simple um but you know people have this
[2:27] idea it's kind of like a secular belief
[2:29] kind of like this you know maybe in the
[2:30] nominal Christian World well I'm a good
[2:32] person you know I I you know I don't do
[2:35] nothing too too terribly wrong you know
[2:37] I I you know I don't commit adultery I
[2:39] don't lie I don't cheat I don't steal
[2:42] you know I you know I I may have my
[2:43] faults and my failures but you know I'm
[2:45] a good person and I'm sure God will
[2:47] understand that you know when I you know
[2:50] day of judgment you know I'll somehow
[2:52] I'll be a good enough person then
[2:54] that'll my good will cancel out my bad
[2:56] you know on the whole I'm a good person
[3:00] yeah
[3:02] and you know and so we have this you
[3:05] know if I'm just good enough I'll go to
[3:07] heaven or or you know good people go to
[3:09] heaven and it's it's it's a cliche and
[3:13] it you know people fall into it and
[3:14] people gravitate towards that notion
[3:16] because there is a little kernel of
[3:18] Truth in it right there is a little
[3:21] piece of Truth in that it's just not
[3:23] what people really expect and it's not
[3:25] what people fully
[3:28] understand and so I you know to to flesh
[3:32] this out I want to turn to uh Matthew St
[3:34] Matthew chapter 19 and verse
[3:39] 16 um I'll
[3:45] turn
[3:50] and
[3:52] says and behold one came and said unto
[3:55] him good Master what good thing shall I
[3:57] do that I may have eternal
[4:01] life and he said unto him why callest
[4:04] thou me good there is none good but one
[4:07] that is God but if thou will enter into
[4:09] life keep this
[4:12] Commandments keep the
[4:14] Commandments now couple things I want to
[4:16] point out about this number one Jesus
[4:20] did not correct him right he didn't say
[4:24] don't call me good there's only one good
[4:26] but God that's not what he said he
[4:29] clarifi
[4:30] ified do you know what you just said and
[4:33] did you mean
[4:34] it right he's he's and the other thing
[4:38] to bear in mind is Jesus knows that he
[4:40] knows the thoughts and intents of the
[4:41] heart he knows what the Rich Young Ruler
[4:43] meant when he said that right he's not
[4:46] asking for his own edification he's
[4:48] getting this young man to confirm to
[4:51] himself I'm speaking to God In the Flesh
[4:54] amen right that's what he's doing he's
[4:56] he's establishing this that when this
[4:59] young man is asking him for how do I
[5:01] attain eternal life he's going to get
[5:03] the actual answer it's not going to be a
[5:06] a a you know just some you know wise
[5:09] man's belief it's going to be actual God
[5:13] In the Flesh giving him the answer to
[5:15] that
[5:17] question and so he says you know keep
[5:20] the Commandments and then the and the
[5:22] man says um he said unto him which and
[5:25] Jesus said Thou shalt do no murder Thou
[5:27] shalt not commit adultery Thou shalt not
[5:30] steal thou shall not bear false witness
[5:32] honor thy father and thy mother and thou
[5:34] shalt love thy neighbor as thyself the
[5:37] young man saith unto him all these
[5:39] things have I kept from my youth youth
[5:41] up what lack I
[5:44] yet and Jesus said unto him if thou wil
[5:48] be perfect go and sell that thou Hast
[5:52] and give to the poor and thou shalt have
[5:54] treasure in heaven and come and follow
[5:56] me and when the young man heard that
[5:58] saying he went away sorrowful for he had
[6:01] great
[6:02] possessions
[6:05] now the interesting what you know what I
[6:08] gravitate what what my sticks out to
[6:12] me is number one when the man came to
[6:16] him in the first place he's asked him
[6:18] what good thing must I do right he's got
[6:21] this mentality it's this that that exact
[6:24] mentality of if I'm just a good enough
[6:26] person I'll make it right I can gain
[6:29] eternal life by doing some service to
[6:33] God what good thing do I got to
[6:36] do
[6:39] and you know Jesus says okay we'll keep
[6:41] the Commandments he's okay well I've
[6:42] kept all the
[6:44] Commandments and okay so then now
[6:46] there's this other the last thing he's
[6:47] got to do is sell all that he has amen
[6:52] and go follow Jesus
[6:55] now Jesus didn't tell him to sell all
[6:58] that he had and start from zero and no
[6:59] you know go live your life donate
[7:01] everything you have to the poor and then
[7:02] you know you can do whatever you want
[7:03] after that right the key part there is
[7:06] to come follow me part right because
[7:09] there was a bunch there were there were
[7:10] disciples with
[7:12] Jesus who they they didn't Peter didn't
[7:15] keep the Commandments from the time he
[7:17] was a youth you know Peter was a was a a
[7:20] rascal right you know all these you know
[7:24] St Matthew he was a a a crooked tax
[7:26] collector he was a cheat you know amen
[7:30] he you know there's all these PE these
[7:31] people were not they didn't keep the
[7:33] Commandments from their youth but the
[7:35] key thing was whatever it was that they
[7:37] had they gave it up to follow Jesus it
[7:40] wouldn't have mattered what it was in
[7:42] particular it's just that they gave it
[7:43] up in order to follow
[7:45] Jesus that was the key part
[7:49] and you know people have this mentality
[7:51] of it it wasn't about and so you know in
[7:54] the scientific world we would say if
[7:56] there's something that
[7:58] changes you know things that things that
[8:00] change or don't change or whatever and
[8:01] it doesn't affect the outcome we call
[8:03] those irrelevant variables right whether
[8:06] or not he was a good person whether or
[8:08] not he kept the Commandments up until
[8:10] that point was kind of irrelevant it
[8:12] didn't really matter because some people
[8:16] didn't keep the Commandments he clearly
[8:18] did keep the Commandments the people who
[8:20] didn't keep the Commandments got eternal
[8:21] life and he didn't so the keeping of The
[8:24] Commandments wasn't really relevant up
[8:27] until that point now that also there's a
[8:30] balance to that there is also not a
[8:33] justification to just live any old way
[8:37] right in order to follow Jesus you still
[8:39] have to keep the Commandments once
[8:41] you're following Jesus there is a
[8:42] mandate to keep those Commandments and
[8:45] if you have some verbal Ascent to Christ
[8:48] as a savior but have no intention of
[8:51] keeping Commandments then okay you you
[8:54] know that CH you know Jesus is the
[8:55] Christ that so do the Devils right there
[8:59] there has to be a life lived in that
[9:04] but the point is attainment to you know
[9:08] being a good person isn't through some
[9:10] sort of
[9:11] works right you know doing good things
[9:14] doesn't make you a good person because
[9:16] there's only one good but God and you're
[9:18] not going to become God through good
[9:20] works
[9:22] right so but like I said there is a
[9:25] kernel of Truth in that statement good
[9:27] people go to heaven right
[9:30] there's a kernel of Truth in that and
[9:31] that's why it's deceptive right that's
[9:33] why people gravitate towards it um
[9:36] because all good Lies start on a
[9:38] truth um at least the really deceptive
[9:41] ones
[9:42] do and I want
[9:44] to turn to uh back to St John
[9:51] 14 and kind of show you the way I want
[9:54] to where my mind is on
[9:56] that uh
[10:05] this is St John chapter 14 and verse
[10:08] 16 says and I will pray the father and
[10:11] he shall give you another comforter that
[10:13] he may abide with you forever even the
[10:15] spirit of Truth whom the world cannot
[10:18] receive because it seeth him not neither
[10:20] knoweth him but ye know him for he
[10:23] dwelleth with you and shall be in you
[10:26] amen right so he's identifying himself
[10:30] right because he dwelleth with you well
[10:32] who's dwelling with them right then well
[10:34] Christ was dwelling with them right
[10:36] then um and shall be in you and I will
[10:39] leave you I will not leave you
[10:41] comfortless I will come to you yet a
[10:43] little while and the world seeth me no
[10:45] more but ye see me because I live ye
[10:48] shall live also at that day you shall
[10:51] know that I am in my father and ye in me
[10:54] and I in you and he that hath my
[10:58] Commandments and keepeth them
[11:00] um he that hath my Commandments and
[11:02] keepeth them he it is that loveth me and
[11:05] he that loveth me shall be loved of my
[11:08] father and I will love him and will
[11:10] manifest myself to him so again there at
[11:12] the at the end to reiterate this idea
[11:15] that oh well you know I'll just have
[11:17] some mental Ascent that you know I I
[11:19] love Jesus well no you don't you don't
[11:21] actually unless you're keeping
[11:23] Commandments right there there is that
[11:25] stipulation you there you know you can
[11:27] say what you want to but unless you're
[11:28] conf coning to what Christ commanded you
[11:31] to how Christ commanded you to live
[11:32] there's no actual love there but notice
[11:36] Christ is is indicating uh something and
[11:39] I want to turn to First
[11:44] John want to kind of start wrapping up
[11:47] uh 1 John chapter
[11:52] 4 and we'll start at verse one and he
[11:55] says um beloved believe not every Spirit
[12:01] but try the spirits whether they are of
[12:03] God because many false prophets are gone
[12:05] out into the world hereby know ye that
[12:08] the spirit of know ye the spirit of
[12:11] God every spirit that confesseth that
[12:13] Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of
[12:16] God and every spirit that confesseth not
[12:19] that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh
[12:21] is not of God and this is that Spirit of
[12:25] antichrist whereof you have heard that
[12:27] it should come and even now already is
[12:29] in the
[12:31] world verse four ye are of God little
[12:33] children and have overcome them because
[12:36] greater is he that is in you than he
[12:37] that is in the
[12:38] world
[12:40] so
[12:44] um looking at verse two again it
[12:47] says if you want to know if you want to
[12:49] have discernment and be able to discern
[12:51] what Spirits are of God you know what
[12:53] spirit is of God then here's here's a
[12:56] good way here's the indicator right
[12:59] every spirit that confesseth that Jesus
[13:01] Christ has come in the flesh is of
[13:03] God okay and then going down every
[13:07] spirit that confesseth not that Jesus
[13:09] Christ is come in the flesh is not of
[13:11] God right
[13:13] and and that spirit that confesseth not
[13:16] that Jesus Christ come in the flesh is
[13:18] the anti Spirit of antichrist that
[13:19] you've heard about and so I'm telling
[13:22] you in this day so many people are
[13:25] running to and fro looking for all the
[13:28] Antichrist is coming coming even you
[13:29] know non- message people you know
[13:31] secular or not um not secular but uh
[13:33] nominal Christian people people who you
[13:36] know don't really you know believe the
[13:37] message even people are everyone's
[13:41] looking for the Antichrist people can
[13:42] see that in the the world is kind of
[13:44] looking a lot like the Book of
[13:45] Revelations at this point um and
[13:47] everyone's looking for the Antichrist oh
[13:49] what's the Antichrist going to be who's
[13:50] the Antichrist you
[13:53] know well here's the an you know you we
[13:56] the Bible tells the Antichrist is coming
[13:58] so if you want to know what it is and
[14:00] what it looks like here you go it's the
[14:04] one that says Jesus Christ has not come
[14:05] in the flesh that's the spirit that you
[14:08] got to look out for
[14:12] and interesting language that was used
[14:15] there I think because number
[14:17] one it said Jesus Christ Has Come In the
[14:21] Flesh now when Jesus is on the
[14:26] Earth all right let let me put it like
[14:28] this me let me make an analogy if I say
[14:32] you know uh uh you know brother Travis
[14:37] Jackson is come in the flesh and you
[14:40] know you someone's going to try to deny
[14:42] that brother Travis Jackson is come in
[14:43] the flesh well it's obvious the fact
[14:45] that I even have a name to attach that
[14:47] shows that he was come in the flesh he's
[14:49] on Earth he's a he's a physical person
[14:52] right no one was referring to God to God
[14:56] as Jesus Christ before Jesus Christ came
[14:59] Came In the
[15:00] Flesh
[15:02] right doesn't you know he was Jehovah he
[15:06] was you know Yahweh he was a lot of
[15:08] different things but he was never Jesus
[15:09] Christ until he came in the flesh okay
[15:12] so to deny so it doesn't make any sense
[15:15] why someone would try to deny that Jesus
[15:17] Christ came in the flesh if they're
[15:18] talking about the man who walked on the
[15:20] shores of
[15:21] Galilee right no one's going to deny
[15:24] that people met him right this book is
[15:27] written by someone who literally met
[15:31] him what John is saying is the spirit of
[15:34] the Antichrist is the one that says
[15:36] Jesus not Christ has come in your
[15:39] flesh that's what he's referring to
[15:42] right because what does he say greater
[15:45] is he that is in you than he that is in
[15:47] the world that's the spirit right the
[15:51] spirit that's in you is what's what's
[15:53] showing that Jesus Christ Has Come In
[15:55] the Flesh what spirit is in you right
[15:58] what did Jesus say I'll be with you even
[16:00] in you who's the comforter that would
[16:02] come to you right the the the message of
[16:06] the hour has come to
[16:09] restore an indwelling of the Holy Spirit
[16:12] back into the people it's a restoration
[16:15] of Christ back into the people right and
[16:19] when things would come anything that
[16:21] would come between you and the
[16:23] indwelling of Christ with into you that
[16:26] is the spirit of antichrist anything
[16:28] that would come against you and say that
[16:29] that's a false thing that is a spirit of
[16:32] antichrist because it is it is contrary
[16:35] to Christ coming in the
[16:37] flesh right that this
[16:41] this um and and that would be the that
[16:44] would be the
[16:46] the that would be the great
[16:49] um uh deception of the age right that
[16:53] would be the great lie at this end time
[16:56] that would put the incarnation of Christ
[17:00] in the flesh is something that happened
[17:02] a couple thousand years ago and not
[17:04] something that's current now not
[17:06] something that's available to people now
[17:09] right that's what would you know you
[17:12] know we live in a day where we have a
[17:15] promise that Christ can is on the Earth
[17:18] again right the the entire message of
[17:21] the hour is hinged on that one concept
[17:25] everything is hinged on that and so
[17:28] often Our Lives you know that's what the
[17:31] devil tries to do you know with with
[17:33] every struggle it seems like that we
[17:35] that we
[17:36] have is a um every trial every every uh
[17:42] when the devil tries to come against you
[17:43] spiritually it's always to hinder that
[17:47] key component right to either either
[17:51] stifle the spirit moving in your life
[17:53] through distraction through um through
[17:58] uh you know know stress hardship you
[18:00] know it seems like
[18:02] every you know I I I brother uh Caleb
[18:07] asked me if I could cover for him the
[18:08] Sunday he was actually scheduled to to
[18:09] do Sunday school and I I said yes and
[18:11] then the next day everything went to
[18:14] pieces you know the you know the you
[18:18] know everything goes sideways you know
[18:20] I'm you know back to back to back to
[18:23] back why because the devil's trying to
[18:26] to you know flood the Zone with with
[18:29] distractions and problems that I've got
[18:31] to deal with why because he's trying to
[18:33] hinder something right he's trying to
[18:35] hinder someone to be encouraged he's
[18:37] trying to he's trying to create so many
[18:39] potholes that you can't move forward or
[18:42] he'll just give you something that that
[18:44] that uh you know is going to take up
[18:46] your time he's going to try to you know
[18:48] siphon up your time with social media or
[18:51] or whatever or he's going to try to you
[18:54] know attack your attack you mentally
[18:56] give you some sort of depression or give
[18:58] you some sort of anx xiety that you're
[18:59] constantly dealing with that that you
[19:01] can't you know hold to a promise because
[19:04] you know you're all in your own feelings
[19:06] about something that you did or said or
[19:07] whatever you know everything is always
[19:10] to hinder the recognition that Christ is
[19:14] in you and trying to do
[19:15] something right that is uh like the
[19:19] number
[19:21] one uh problem that we deal with in this
[19:24] age and anything that is going against
[19:28] you that is trying to shut you down and
[19:31] not let the spirit of Christ move in
[19:33] your life that is the
[19:35] Antichrist by definition it is the
[19:38] opposite of Christ it is inhibiting
[19:40] Christ right which and the other side of
[19:44] it is if you really look into what the
[19:46] word Antichrist means doesn't
[19:48] necessarily mean opposite of it really
[19:52] if you get the heart of what it means it
[19:53] means a substitute for right does not
[19:57] Antichrist is not necess necessarily the
[19:59] opposite of Christ it is the substitute
[20:02] for Christ right it is not Christ but it
[20:08] assuages the conscience in your head
[20:10] that tells you you need Christ right
[20:15] and you know that's what that's what the
[20:17] whole world is being flooded with is um
[20:21] you know especially in this day and age
[20:22] where it seems like there's this massive
[20:24] uptick in you know Uprising in spiritual
[20:27] awareness you know huge numbers of
[20:30] people are recognizing that the you know
[20:32] uh you need you need some sort of
[20:34] Christian values to hold the world
[20:37] together right you know to hold Society
[20:39] together well you know we we're going to
[20:40] be good people and you know we're going
[20:42] to we're going to make America uh a a a
[20:45] moral country again and America is going
[20:48] to be was great when it was Christian
[20:51] and we're going to make America
[20:52] Christian again and they will do it in
[20:55] name only right they will they will have
[20:59] a lot of people going to church a lot of
[21:01] people go to church and I and a lot of
[21:04] people who go to church are not
[21:05] Christians am right because they've
[21:08] they've they have a form right they they
[21:11] do all the things that look like
[21:13] Christianity they do all the things that
[21:14] look like Christ they do all the
[21:16] Commandments right they keep all these
[21:18] Commandments do a lot of good works but
[21:20] there's no actual indwelling there's
[21:23] nothing because when it comes down to
[21:24] when somebody says you know the whole
[21:26] thing of like well you know I'm a good
[21:27] person
[21:29] usually what that is associated with the
[21:32] other statement that's attached to is I
[21:34] have this problem I have this thing I
[21:37] don't want to give up I have this
[21:39] one Crystal prized thing that you can't
[21:43] claw out of my hands right but I'm a
[21:47] good person I'll make it on that you
[21:49] know what it was every single person who
[21:53] followed Jesus had something right it
[21:55] was they had some dream they had some
[21:58] ambition they had something right and in
[22:01] this day and age everybody's got
[22:03] something and what when Jesus spoke to
[22:06] the rich rich young ruler and told him
[22:08] to sell everything that he had and
[22:10] follow him what it boiled down to was it
[22:13] it wasn't necessarily his wealth in
[22:15] particular it was just that particular
[22:18] to him it was
[22:19] wealth right there there are Christians
[22:23] who can have money but I guarantee you
[22:25] the real genuine Christians who have
[22:27] wealth will not not cling to it and put
[22:29] it between them and Christ right they if
[22:33] if God told them if if the Lord spoke to
[22:35] them and told them to sell it all off
[22:37] and and be a popper they do it in a
[22:38] heartbeat right and anybody who wouldn't
[22:41] well then that's that's what's the
[22:44] stumbling block right it doesn't have to
[22:47] be wealth it could be anything it could
[22:50] be your job you know I'm you know I'm
[22:53] I'm you know I just I want to be a
[22:56] businessman I have this dream of growing
[22:58] my business and I'm going to be a great
[22:59] businessman and I'm going to have this
[23:01] awesome I just got to work 80 hours a
[23:03] week stay out of church and never be a
[23:05] father to my kids you know I could you
[23:07] know I'm not going to be in the position
[23:09] because what did he tell him he said
[23:10] take up your cross and follow
[23:12] me well the
[23:15] cross Jesus wasn't crucified yet to the
[23:18] average person that doesn't speak to at
[23:21] that time when Jesus said that the cross
[23:24] meant nothing other than a public form
[23:26] of execution yeah a humiliating form of
[23:30] execution at that when he's talking
[23:31] about taking up a cross only people who
[23:33] took up crosses were the people who were
[23:35] humiliated publicly and publicly
[23:37] executed right to to Bear a cross was
[23:40] basically saying are you willing to
[23:42] publicly humiliate yourself to sell off
[23:45] all the comfort that you have sell off
[23:46] your status as a wealthy man of power
[23:51] burn it all to the ground and then go
[23:52] sleep on the side of the street with me
[23:55] and my followers are you willing to
[23:58] instead of stepping over that beggar
[24:00] every morning on the way to the market
[24:02] are you willing to go make your bed next
[24:03] to
[24:05] him and that's what he wouldn't give up
[24:08] I I can't do it and he and again he
[24:12] started this conversation by saying you
[24:14] called me good you know that only
[24:16] applies to God do you mean what you just
[24:19] said and the Rich Young Ruler did not
[24:21] correct him he knew exactly who he was
[24:24] talking to he knew full well he was
[24:27] talking to God in flesh
[24:29] and he and he and he turned down the
[24:32] opportunity because he had something he
[24:35] couldn't give up and so many people that
[24:37] have something they can't give up they
[24:39] got something they they just will not
[24:41] let it
[24:42] go and you know uh you know well I you
[24:46] know I okay so I have this thing that I
[24:48] just won't let go of but I'm a good
[24:50] person I go to church I go to a message
[24:52] Church you know I read I read brother
[24:54] brandom and listen to tapes you know I'm
[24:56] a good person if there's something that
[24:59] you will not give up then you will
[25:02] never you will never have a true
[25:04] indwelling of Jehovah inside of you you
[25:07] will never have that and the fact of the
[25:11] matter
[25:12] is good people do go to heaven the
[25:15] problem is the measuring stick for how
[25:18] we determine good is God until you
[25:21] measure up to God no you are not good
[25:25] good people do go to heaven you just
[25:26] will never attain it
[25:28] out in your own doing the only way is to
[25:31] have the that good God dwelling inside
[25:34] of you that's it
[25:37] amen and we're out of time let's let's
[25:46] stand
[25:47] father Lord
[25:50] I I thank you for this opportunity to
[25:52] deliver the burden of My Heart Lord and
[25:55] maybe somebody would have been
[25:56] encouraged father to encourage that they
[26:00] would know that Lord that it is you
[26:02] dwelling inside of them and that it
[26:03] would not be some works that their
[26:05] faults or their failures would not be
[26:08] the determining factor in
[26:11] in in their salvation Lord but it would
[26:13] be that they would cling to you and that
[26:15] they would they would always hold to
[26:17] that salvation that you would offer
[26:20] Lord father that we would be have a a
[26:23] true Revelation that Lord if we would
[26:25] give it up whatever it is that would be
[26:27] in our hearts Lord that would hinder us
[26:29] Lord that if we would just give it up
[26:31] that father you would have something
[26:32] better for us there would always be
[26:34] better something better for us that you
[26:35] would never ask us to give up a treasure
[26:39] unless you had another treasure waiting
[26:40] for us that would be even
[26:42] better so father we ask that you would
[26:45] be with us through the service that you
[26:47] would the remainder of the service that
[26:48] you would go with us throughout the day
[26:50] Watching Over Us and keeping us that the
[26:52] people would be encouraged father I ask
[26:55] this in the name of the Lord Jesus
[26:57] Christ amen amen
