okay I don't see any other visitors so if you're visitor I am sorry amen praise the Lord you love him 1st Samuel chapter 3 just going to get one verse and we'll let you be seated I um you may have noticed it you may have not I've not tried to make a deal out of it I've tried to be kind of subtle um you'll notice that the musicians stay for the reading of the word and then they don't walk off until that's finished and you're seated now we we that on purpose brother Matt inst instituted that some time ago and uh we like it like that and there's reasons behind that uh however uh you know I want to give them an opportunity to make their way out make their way around get back in the service let all the dust settle and um so so that there's no one lingering in the back lingering outside everybody's in when I um get ready to go into the main body of my material amen work hard on these sermons and I want everybody to hear it amen so that's why we say pay attention give me your undivided attention you've heard me say that don't run in and out don't make that door back there a revolving door you're a big boy you're a big girl you can wait amen if you got a little infant and they are a little baby they need to go out well that's Grand I got a soft Grandpa's heart for little children but uh adults uh and and not that that's been a problem recently I'm only saying that as an addendum to what I started saying okay let's move on so you'll notice that oh I'm getting back to what you may have noticed you may have noticed that even if I have a lengthy reading I'll just read an entry let you be seated and I'll make some comments that I want to make while the team here is moving around and getting back in the service excuse me amen 1st Samuel 3:1 and the child Samuel ministered unto the Lord before Eli and the word of the Lord was precious in those days there was no open Vision let's pray father we thank you for your word now already Lord the singing The Worship the reading of the word there's already been such a a train of bless blessing Lord uh here today but now we come Lord to even a more important part and that is to look into the things of God to bring out lord it's my duty as I've been commissioned and instructed by the prophet of this age to take these things and dig these things out for the people and feed it to the people from the scripture as it has been interpreted to me by this message this restorative restoration message of the hour we thank you for the Sunday School classes Lord I know that the intermediate class uh really uh no doubt would would have enjoyed sister Jean's class so that she uh taught them today it was a special class we're grateful that she is able to do that Lord and we ask it be a blessing brother brother JD's class Lord so filled with just such gold Lord I was sitting in the back listening and I thought my what a what a vision what what picturesque speech this is that I just I just see the whole thing that I'm hearing Lord and we thank you for the gifts that are among us now take your word Lord use it mightily to help your people to dress your bride we're here Lord to be a help not a hindrance father if anyone I know that doctors physical doctors take the hypoc IC oath to do no harm but if anybody was going to take that oath it ought to be spiritual doctors like myself so father I'm going to look into your doctor's book today and I'm going to go forth Lord to identify the causes problems in our lives and the remedy for it it's not a whole lot of value just identifying the trouble if we don't have a remedy so I'm giving that also into your hands in Jesus name amen God bless you as you're seated um thanks sir well that's one of them nuclear ones isn't it Bradley yeah I love those amen praise the Lord I um I want to be I don't know if it got read or not brother Aaron sent me a request concerning his mother and um uh she's oops she's been having some uh things going on and and needs a touch from the Lord um says please pray for my mother Tria Simmons she hurt her hip can hardly move my poor sis so will you be remembering amen sister Triva today and U you know we we age out we get old and uh but my the Lord can still come on the scene amen I'm appreciative amen for uh the help that the Lord gives um our our elderly a amen that don't include me yet amen but I'm thankful for the the the help the Lord can give to me too amen praise the Lord thank you buddy all right so I want to take today oh wow yes Gabriel see you should have waved at me Alexis you should have waved Luther you should have threw something happy to have them in here today as well praise the Lord amen see I got people amen so if it gets past me believe me my people will let me know um I want to take a title today precious in thy sight amen and uh I actually preached Wednesday night for brother blue boy we had a fantastic time amen and uh just love the Lord so sister uh sister Sharon actually showed up there her and sister Grace and dropped in on the service and I was so glad to see them I told sister Sharon she might have to hear the sermon twice but actually it's going to be a different approach today which I I wondered if it would be so some of the same material but angled a little different the Lord does it like that you know I I got I got stuff I preached in Arizona I haven't preached here yet we'll get around to it but but I want to take this sermon precious in thy sight and I want you to really quickly get on board because I'm going to use um I'm going to minister a lot by contrast and so you know comparative that's a lot of times you can if you can't get it when somebody explains it then they show you the contrast you go oh okay now oh I see why you said okay now it makes sense so I'm going to kind of use a little bit of contrast tonight this morning and so I want now to if you will turn with me to Philippians chapter 1 and we're going to have a lengthy reading I'm going to leave you seated so in Philippians 1 and we want to begin with verse one and we're going to read down through verse 21 now this is this is a beautiful book you know my Paul's letters to Galatians and Ephesians and Philippians these were these were such beautiful letters and uh there's a lot I could say about that I don't want to uh you know you you that I could say about all those books they have deep meaning to them but uh the book of Philippians if Colossians is the book of Christ because it talks so much about Jesus the express image of his person the express image of God and the the book of Philippians is certainly a letter to the bride and in fact is it's a really really the only church that Paul never really had to correct and so uh they they really were a beacon of righteousness and Holiness uh Philippi was located in Macedonia not on the uh water but near it so Philippians chapter 1 and verse one Paul and Timothy the Servants of Jesus Christ to all the saints in Christ um Let me let me start from my own Bible Paul and timotheus the Servants of Jesus Christ to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are Philippi with the Bishops and deacons Grace be unto you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ I thank my God upon every Rememberance of you always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy for your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now being confident of this very thing that he which hath begun a good work in you has he begun a good work in you well here's some here's some good news in a Troublesome world he that hath which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ so that's good and Troublesome because it means that if you're not cooperating he's going to keep doing it and you know he would like for you every parent you know uh sweetheart put that down that don't touch that but if that doesn't work other measures are required amen all right enough said all right verse seven even as it is meat for me to think this of you all because I have you in my heart boy do I know how that feels in as much as both in my bonds and in the the defense and confirmation of the Gospel ye all are partakers of my grace so that's a scripture that undergirds my constant statement to you we're all in this thing together amen and I I just hope that you understand my heart and my soul when I'm preaching as I look out over this audience this morning and this might not always be true but it happens to be true today I don't see a human being in here that I don't have full faith and confidence you're Sons and Daughters of God and will be with me in glory amen so no matter what I say in this sermon don't lose sight of what I think about you is that a deal now I need to hear you say it is that a deal amen all right amen sister Anna good to see you today praise the Lord all right let's carry on for God is is my record how greatly I long after you all in the bows of Jesus Christ and this I pray that your love may abound yet more and more uh Now Catch what he wants it to abound in in knowledge and in all judgment so it's it you wouldn't necessarily think of love as knowledge and judgment but that's because we think of human love the old fuzzy feeling that fuzzy warm feeling we call love that's just a human sensation of of of felo that's not Agape Agape Love Is the Love of God that is a that is his person remember God doesn't have love he is love and that that life or that love or that life is poured into our hearts by the Holy Ghost so you have that's why I said to you last Sunday there's a big difference between between loving God and having the love of God see you there you and I made that comment we I don't at all think that now I know there's a a hypocritical church that comes up at the Judgment bar and Jesus says there the king says they're all workers of iniquity I get that I'm not talking about that today I'm not preaching to that group today I don't believe any of those are here today uh but but but but just just and that's why I say you know I do see evangelicals and charismatics and Pentecostals and I see Catholics and I see methodists and Baptists who really do love the Lord they really do that's not fake that's not part of that necessarily that iniquity crowd God to be the judge of that thank the Lord but but but just remember yes they have a love for God but that's still not the same as having the love of God having the love of God is the new birth and that places you in the first resurrection and you go in the Rapture is that clear having just a love for God the unwise Virgin have a true love for God but they never get the oil they're not born again they actually are safe from destruction but they don't have the love of God they don't have the token so so I I I I I I'm going to be glad for all of those that make it and I'm sure some are going to make it that I didn't wasn't sure they were going to make it but I'm not preaching to that crowd today I believe I'm preaching to Believers as I look out over this audience today I don't see anyone that I would not firmly in the presence of the Holy Angels say I believe that person is going to be with me in heaven amen see why do you keep coming to hear the word because you're lovers of the word all right so all right let's carry on so so this I pray that you're not the fuzzy human thing May abound amen yet more and more you want my fuzzy my fuzzy feeling to abound more no I want the love of God to abound how do I know it's abounding you'll get a knowledge of the word you'll get an understanding of his nature you'll you'll follow along his character and his example because you can say anything see you can say anything word words are cheap uh but but it's but brother brandham said live me a sermon all right that's the one that God looks at it's the it's that heart reaction to the word of God I can tell you that much it's the heart reaction to the word in whatever form it came that's what gives the foolish virgin eternal life even though they arrive at the at the bar without eternal life am they're granted it because the king can see in their heart and they and he talks about works and they don't even remember doing them they're like well I mean I'm glad I did it but truth is sir I don't really remember doing it but see it was their heart's response to the word the the iniquitous crowd had all kinds of works and they were all invalid none of them counted the king the the king would not count it in their favor because he was looking at their heart see and it was full of iniquity all right so so it matters your heart's response to the word today amen that's what that's the for me friends all my life in Ministry more than 30 years and almost you know more than now coming up on 29 years pastoring this church that's always been the the uh the real vision of me as long as I can see your heart uh for God and I I know you're you you make mistakes I'm going to shock you so do I amen no really no I do for real don't look at sister Debbie I I'm I'm admitting it I do but in my heart I love God and in my life I have the love of God Amen and it causes me to go again and go again and go again and go again and I'm just never going to stop till the coming of Jesus Christ why because I've allowed the Holy Spirit to increase my love in the knowledge see and and not only more but more and more that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment that you may approve things that are excellent see I'll break all this down a little bit as we go I just want to get it read or I'm never going to get anywhere that you may be sincere and without offense till the day of Christ being filled with the fruits of righteousness which are by Jesus Christ unto the glory and the praise of God all right now we're going to skip down um to verse 20 according to my Earnest expectation and my hope that in nothing I shall be ashamed but that with all boldness as always so now also in Christ shall so so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body whether it be by life or by death for to me to live as Christ and to die is gain amen now we will Circle back to Philippians if I don't run out of time I want to come back around to our to our text where we opened up with that where we were in the days of Eli and and Samuel ministered unto the Lord before Eli and the word of the Lord was precious in those days there was no open Vision now precious in the Hebrew which uh has the same basic meaning in the in the Greek also I looked I compared them both and they're pretty much exactly the same thing but precious in the Hebrew where we've read our text is a verb meaning to esteem to to be valuable to be costly so now it's a verb in other words it's action so it it's not just a a thought that you have in your mind oh isn't that lovely well what are you doing about it well oh that's a precious thing really well why do I see it sitting neglected and in danger of being destroyed well but my I love it I believe it's precious well then act like it if something's precious you care about it Am I Wrong something's precious you care about it see I've said many times that in marriage counseling when I see couples in having problems it doesn't take me very long A lot of times you can track it back to to finances and there's conflict because of finances that's that's all that's so often true but but even prior to that one is uh the the the first the number one and it's not only generally the first one but it's the number one vow that I see over 35 years of Ministry the number one vow I see broken in a marriage is the vow to cherish it goes out the window everything becomes old hat and just ho hum and and everything's taken for granted and and that's just a recipe for disaster so this word precious the word was precious in those days because there was no open Vision so when something's rare it's precious precious stones are are precious because they're rare amen e events that happen time that you get to spend with a loved one it's precious to you because it might be rare all right so it's a verb an action word meaning to esteem something in your actions to Value something in your actions to view it as costly it has the basic idea of being highly valuable and worthy you're with me now now you should already be re joing because I'm preaching on precious in thy sight so does he see me as valuable does he see me as worthy I know I don't but does he amen it indicates a high evaluation put on someone or something it indicates considering something worthy of preserving worth preserving such as a human life it can take on the idea of making something rare in certain positive usages the process of redeeming a person now now how much does that cost I'm going to give you a scripture just in a minute I want you to hold that one in your mind the process of redeeming a person is said to cost great effort it is used figuratively of making something scarce or rare you know uh in in life things that come our way in life now brother brandham goes back in the message hear his voice in 1958 there's three sermons where he really um drills down on this idea of the word being precious if I was preaching if it was a preaching sermon today I'd blow through that but this is more of a expository so is that okay we did that last Sunday seemed to be in that gear don't know how long that'll last but we're going to stay right with it brother brandham said in 1958 hear his voice and the child Samuel ministered unto the Lord before Eli and the word of the Lord was precious in those days for there was no open Vision brother brandham says you what is what a vision is then he asks a question here's his answer it's the direct word of the Lord the Lord's word was precious because there was no open vision and the problem with that is without a vision the people perish all right so this is an alarming problem brother Brenham is going to take up this subject and say listen if the if the word of God is rare in your life that could be a problem if the word of God is seldom consumed by you that could be a problem see and so you say well you know what what what if I'm in a position where I can't you know have a live Ministry I'm a shut in there's no church near me well then I would say that the word must be really precious to you and it is precious there's Saints in that condition who who get online spend money on an internet connection set in their living room and stream this service live and by archive and rejoice with you why because the word is precious you don't know what you have until you don't have it Amen brother brandham goes on to say the voice of God hearing his voice in that day was a rare thing see there was no open vision and it was a rare thing the real voice of God now fortunately that was going to get solved as Samuel started to grow he started seeing visions when he hearing the voice of God when he was very young so he says to hear the voice of God and and it's a rare thing now he's going to bring that into the modern day and into his cub scout day now just imagine what it is in our day so he says and it was a rare thing the real voice of God because the people had gotten away amen so now he's not blaming God he's not even goingon to he is going to throw some shade on the ministry but he's he's going to start out by saying the people had gotten away they had a church in that day that just didn't follow the Commandments of the Lord are you glad for a church that does really are you glad for a church that does I know it can be scalding sometimes just trust me when us ministers are up here scalding you it's scalding us we've already been hided you know got a hiding in the in the back office and so we're all in this thing together so he said they had a church in that day that just didn't follow the Commandments of the Lord they had a minister by the name of Eli and he had gotten away from God by just teaching the precept of what the people wanted to believe you appreciating your team here a little more today see preaching what the people wanted to believe if that isn't a parallel to this day he just taught the people and he looked he took his choice ones you know in the sacrifice and they put the hook in he always was taking the best and he told his sons to take the best of the Flesh and their hooks out of the offering and he says it just became a place where the offering was the main thing I don't ever want this place to be where the tithes and offerings are the main thing I want to preach the gospel if all of you stop paying tithes and offerings thank you that you do but you know shame on you if you don't cuz every real Christian does you're not a Christian if you're not paying tithes and offerings that's the that's that's direct quotes that's the scripture you're not preaching on that today you should be glad thankfully it's not a serious problem here it's a problem somewhat in every church that I've ever seen including this one but it's not a serious problem here praise the Lord um so so so brother Brandon is saying so the church just became a place where the offering was the main thing all right now I'll come back to brother brandom in us a little bit I want to read you some scriptures because you know now we're going to look at by comparison of some things the Bible called precious and hopefully this will inform your thinking as to what ought to be labeled precious and what ought not to be all right so you remember and I'm not necessarily going to read them all and Noah don't try to follow me because I'm going to go too fast just going to mainly quote and and and go quickly so but if you want to make a note when you go home in 1st Samuel 26:21 tells the story of of King Saul saying to David he's apologizing David I found out you could have killed me in my sleep you could have killed me when I wasn't looking you had several opportunities you didn't take them and he says David return home he starts calling him his son again s Saul's going insane by an evil spirit starts calling David his son I'll no more do thee harm because my soul was precious in Thine Eyes this day behold I have played the fool and have aired exceedingly except the Lord of harvest had left us a seed we would be all together like under Sodom and Gomorrah we have played the fool we have aired exceedingly but my soul was precious in His sight he cared about me he cares about you thank God amen so you remember the story from second Kings chapter 1 where the king sent to get Elijah down off the mountain he sent a captain with 50 and man of God all arrogant man of God King wants you ASAP well let's see if I'm a man of God if I be a man of God fire will come down and consume all of yall gone they were gone that's 51 humans incinerated in a moment from Heaven God's been known to Stone people from Heaven incinerate people from Heaven he's not to be messed with or trifled with he's a serious man you understand he cares about his word he cares about his Messengers be careful be careful when you're dealing with his Messengers or his servants be careful some times I I I I had one man one time many years ago doesn't go to this church many years ago and and began to just bash a certain Minister and I knew that what he was saying was actually accurate the brother had done some things of impropriety but I just stopped him I said brother be careful be very careful because that is a servant of the Lord whether he's whether he's not living a life Worthy is one thing but be careful because truly he does have an evident Min he does have an evident fruit of his Ministry and signs and wonders and he does preach the word uh so and he said well why why should I be careful if I'm right I said because you could be absolutely right and get in a lot of trouble be careful see so so he they the king does it again 50 more 51 more are dead now you 102 men have died uh between morning and noon and finally the third one comes and he's got his 50 and he gets on his hands and knees with his face to the ground and crawls up to the prophet and he says behold there came fire down from heaven and burn up the two captains of the former 50s with their 50s therefore let my life now be precious in thy sight amen and it was Elijah had mercy we find out that when the queen of shean I got to go quicker the queen of shean First Kings 10 when she came through the Bible said she came came to Jerusalem with a very great train with camels that bore spices and very much gold and precious stones and when she came to Solomon she communed with him of all that was in her heart I want to tell you something friends when you come to God bring him precious things bringing precious things making the first in your life this this being can do amazing things for you and your and your life and so she came with reverence and just a heathen Queen but God honored her 2 Chronicles when Solomon was building the house of the Lord and Solomon was so stressed out because it had to be a great Solomon didn't he just felt so inadequate so so no way I can do this how am I going to pull this off the house that contains my God has to be great how am I going to build a house to contain the God of all Heaven that created heavens and earth but here's one but so so really the answer to that is he couldn't but here's what he could do he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty and the and and the gold was the gold of parame and he built it out of the Cedars of Lebanon and he did all he could do I just say to you today in your life you can't ever be completely worthy of housing the Lord Jesus Christ but that's okay because when he comes in you you get credit for his perfect life just make sure you do what you can do at least bring gold and precious stones let that be your life Peter said you're built you're the T you're the living Tabernacle of the living God's presence so build it beautiful so so we find here's that scripture in Psalms 49 the price of a soul people making their boast about their power and they don't need God and they can go on without God thank you very much and God's reply is them that you can't even redeem your own brother what what do you think you got all this power none none of them can by any means redeem his brother nor give God give to God a ransom for him for the Redemption of their soul is precious and it ceaseth forever in other words Redemption does not come so easily see for for no one here's why because no one can ever pay enough money to live forever you understand the there's no amount of money there's no amount of worldly Treasures you could bring or works that you could do for God to earn eternal life whatever you did might have value but eventually that value is going to run out because you're going to be burning up time but but eternal life has no end to it and and God is just simply saying there's no one who who can pay enough money to live forever and never see the grave so here's the message you need him how precious are thy thoughts unto me D the psalmist said in Psalms 139 how precious are thy thoughts unto me oh God how great is the some of them David or Solomon I should rather say in the third proverb refers to wisdom and in wisdom he calls her precious she is more precious than Ruth rubies and now that's that's this is the wisdom of God and Solomon says you need to find her you need to find her and because her wisdom is is above rubies don't chase rubies see and in fact is he said and all the things that thou C desire are not to be compared to her so there's nothing you could make a list of today of I don't care how much how long your list was you know I want an education and I want money and I want friends and I want likes and I want this and I want that and I want power and I want I want Beauty and I want society and I want the world make a list check it twice none of it is equal to one thing finding W God's wisdom it's a chasing of the wind to to live a life without the wisdom of God he goes on in the 20th Solomon says again there is gold okay there is gold uh and a multitude of rubies okay I'll give that up there is gold there is a multitude of rubies they're there for the taking but the lips of knowledge are a precious Jewel the lips of knowledge I would rather give my children lips of knowledge than give them rubies and gold because I've seen too many parents give their kids rubies and gold and every kind of every kind of thing that the world to make them a success in the world a world that's burning down and I'm not opposed to having your children Excel but just remember if you win the rat race kill a rat brother brandom says he says they talk about you know this was before 69 he said they talk about going to the Moon brother ad him says well I care about the moon he said they get up there they won't find nothing they did and they didn't and he said I want to pass the moon so fast they don't even see it hallelujah oh he said he said they they want this education and that education he said education civilization is all of the devil and will perish he says Heaven won't have any education and then the next breath says it'll be an education so far superior ior to this this won't even be thought of so where are you laying your Treasures young people what is your goal what's precious to you what's precious to you Mom and Dad how you how are you raising them how how are you raising them looking right in your eyes how are you raising them see those of you who aren't don't have children yet but children are on the way and what what are you going to do what's going to be your decision there's there's been parents in this church that I preach this kind of preaching to I've I've went through five or six generations of young people I'm getting old I I I dedicated them as babies baptized them with little kids and now they're grown adults blown out into the world because their parents didn't care enough to take what I was preaching and make the changes in their home and their children have followed them right into the world and we'll follow them right into the tribulation and we'll follow them right into the Lake of Fire if they don't find Christ W it's it's it's tragically sad so he says the lips of knowledge are precious jewels now I I want you to understand that that this lady wisdom that is more precious than rubies and that there's no collection of things that you could even desire to compare to her and these lips of knowledge that are precious jewels this is the very wisdom and knowledge that the world has rejected in every age amen so it shouldn't seem peculiar to you that I that preachers preach about this because the Bible says in Romans 1 for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made there's no way to deny the presence of God when you walk around in nature you're an idiot if you do that you're blind there's no way to look at the cosmos and see the Perfection and see how it all works and how all nature runs in continuity and and and and and to think that that happened by accident that is silly and if you have a creation you have to have a Creator because nothing something can't come from nothing so there has to be a cause there has to be a causer amen and nature is reflective of his Beauty just like I have had children and my children you all enjoy as friends beautiful young men and and they're an expression of me they came out of me that's what nature came out of God that's why it's beautiful that's why we love it amen because we're built out of we come out of the same thing that's why you love the word of God because a gene of God's nature was down inside you and it came to life Hallelujah see but but the world in in in in in large part has rejected it get that through your head I'm sorry that's true but it's never not been so he's going back all the way to the anti deluvian people the Ancients he said they saw God they saw the things that are made even his eternal power in Godhead so that they are without excuse no wonder Jesus preached to them in hell and Jesus went down there and told them said you ought to have listened to Noah you should have listen you didn't but you should have see and so he says they're without excuse because that when they knew God so at one time they did they glorified him not as God neither were thankful but became vain in their own imaginations and their foolish heart was darken professing themselves to be wise they became fools see and even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge this is blistering this is an indictment you can't even hide I can't even I can't even make an excuse for these people even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge you remember that knowledge that's more valuable than rubies that knowledge that's precious stones even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge God just gave them over to a rep probate mind to do those things which are not convenient being filled with all unrighteousness fornication wickedness covetousness maliciousness full of Envy murder debate deceit malignity Whispers backbiters haters of God disrespectful proud boasters am I reading a headline out of the modern day or is this 2,000 year old text boasters inventors of evil things disobedient Parents Without natural understanding Covenant Breakers without natural affection a lot of parents suffer from that they don't have a natural affection to to live the kind of Life they should live in front of their children even though it's going to corrupt and poison them implacable unmerciful who knowing the Judgment of God that they which commit such things are worthy of death not only do the same but have pleasure in them that do them they'll they'll clap for the people who are against God I didn't make that up Paul didn't make that up that that's that that's true see so but but now that's contrast all right remember I told you I was going to keep going back and forth so you can get what precious is Isaiah 28 16 therefore thus saith the Lord behold I lay in Zion this is the remedy this the remedy for a Dying World this is the remedy that he prescribed for rebellious Israel behold I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone a tried Stone a precious Cornerstone a sure Foundation that's Christ that's a sure Foundation there is no other Foundation to build your life on besides that Jeremiah records in Lamentations 4:2 that the sons of Zion are comparable to fine gold and they're precious the sons of Zion how many sons of Zion do we have in here today the son the precious sons of Zion comparable to to find gold going into the New Testament I'm just hurrying along boy I got to hurry Matthew 26:7 there came un unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment poured it on his head as he said at me and brother brandom talks about that precious ointment of this woman that even though when she went into the store to buy it she was worried because she knew he was a prophet she knew he'll know brother Ram says picks up in the narrative starts telling the story uh he says she she he said she said she'll he'll know where I got this he'll know but I got to do it anyway and she grabbed her little treasure box and broke it took out all of her money that she had made you know I going to tell you something friends he just wants your life it doesn't matter how bad you wrecked it it doesn't matter how soiled you made it he can clean it he'll take it right now it doesn't matter what happened but that that that that wasn't the point the point was she wanted the best for him and she told the storekeeper here's all my money I want the best I want the best he said Jesus wants your best he deserves your best he said you ought to make him first don't make him second he don't want to be second he don't deserve to be second see and so and then brother Bram you know he Segways to The woman there who came into Simon's house you remember that and they were all laughing at Jesus they all was there just like the world they're laughing at him they're all there to just ridicule him they're all there to just judge him and and and cast shade on him but brother Brandon talks about that woman that came in and fell at his feet began to wash his feet with her tears brother brandham said in all that unbelief in all of that hypocrisy he said it only took one woman to change the whole atmosphere and sins were forgiven and a soul was redeemed and 10,000 worlds of value was captured Peter says in uh first Peter uh six wherein you greatly rejoice now we're going to show you some contrast wherein you greatly Rejoice though now for a season if need be you are in heaviness through manifold Temptations verse 7 that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perisheth though it be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honor and Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ oh I love that friends we're talking about something you know why it's more precious than gold because gold perisheth this preciousness of Christ never perishes Hallelujah whatever your suffering is today whatever trial you might be in right now just know this that your life there will be praise and it'll be honor and it'll be glory so do your wor Satan because once I get as brother how Howard Carol said go ahead Satan carry on old boy this is your day my day is coming Hallelujah my day is coming oh my so Peter says that on down in the 18th and 19th verses for as much as you know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things as silver and gold from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers but you were redeemed with the precious blood of Christ Christ Hallelujah he goes on in his second letter whereby are here's another contrast whereby are given to us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature there's nothing you can do in your life more valuable to you than be a partaker of a divine nature when you are a partaker of divine nature you will never die when you're a partaker of a divine nature Satan is under your feet when you are a partaker of divine nature all Heaven is behind you how do I get that there's precious promises precious they're in the word do you care about them what is precious to you today is this precious if it is that's good if it's not that's real bad see it goes on Revelation 21 1011 and he carried me away in the spirit to a great high mountain and showed me that great City at Holy Jerusalem this is uh the the holy Jerusalem is a type of the Bride I don't have time to preach on that today the holy Jerusalem descending Out of Heaven from God having the glory of God and her light she even calls it a her she has the glory of God and her light was liken to a stone most precious amen even like a jasper stone clear as Crystal friends stop letting the devil beat you up with your failed past I'll promise you when you get to that City when you are that city you'll be clear as Crystal you'll be clear as Crystal verse n 21 verse 19 the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all all manner of precious stones so do you wonder why I say all the time that our future is bright how can you read that how do you read that and not think our future is bright see oh but the devil he don't matter is eternal life precious to you come on is eternal life precious to you have you been granted eternal life have you been given the opportunity to serve God then he don't matter hallelujah it's when you stop short of that lofty position in Christ now Satan matters now he matters when you don't when when when you don't when you stop short of allowing the mind which was in Christ to be in you when you stop short of letting the word dwell in you richly amen see when you're not willing to uh flee youthful lust when you're not willing to cast down vain imaginations when you're not W then Satan matters when you're not willing to do those things when you're not willing to bring every thought subject to the Holy Spirit CU if you bring that thought to the Holy Spirit he'll kill it if you don't you'll ruminate and next thing you know it'll lead to an act oh friends this is a rocket science this is overcoming 101 I want to be an overcomer the word is precious to me eternal life is precious to me the example I live in front of you is a precious thing see it's when you stop short of that lofty position now that's when Satan matters that's exactly when he matters and he plays for blood continuing with our quote from hear ye him or I'm sorry hear his voice 1958 and Samuel just uh he he says Samuel he means Eli of course and Eli just careless about the way that he handled the Commandments of the Lord and the real word of God was a rare thing that's the way it is today we go to church and we find the people going in and having some great drive on oh we want to make our denomination this year so many more bring bring your letter from the other Church Unite with us and slogans like a million more and 44 and all such as that trying to outgrow the next denomination and in doing so we've let the bars down to the Bible because that's really one of the only ways you can do it see uh if if you preach the fresh kill of the word only Eagles will gather see and so so but I like eagles amen I Jonathan's always trying to get me to go birding with him and he loves the Raptors and next time he says hey Dad you want to go uh you want to go birding uh for eagles and I'll say I'm going Sunday amen wow that's some beautiful ones whoa look at all them Eagles so he says um and in doing so we've let the bars down of the Bible we've got away and began to teach things different the prophets spoke of these days they did it didn't get here by accident prophets knew it was coming prophets spoke of these days that when they for teaching would teach the man's Doctrine and not God's Doctrine and we've seen so much of that it's gone on so long until today the in the in the remember there's Boy Scouts this is Cub Scouts this is kindergarten 1958 all right love to have those simple days for serving God again see and in the and in the Cub Scout days just by contrast think of about what it is now think of what your children have access to think of what you have access to see so he says and we've so much of that today and it's gone on so long until today the word of the word of the Lord is a rare thing that someone can come and say thus sayeth the Lord I I hope that's not true in our homes friends I hope it's not true for you and your family that the that partaking of the word of the Lord is a rare thing see we've had a lot of impersonation of that Satan is really on the job see and so he goes on I'm just trying to skip down it's a rare thing to hear the voice of the Lord to find a a person that can you know say the Lord spoke to me you notice that amongst the people anymore that they hardly hear a time you know and and he talks about prayer that they they can't say the Lord spoke to me because there's no more praying like there used to be and their homes were back then their homes were set in order by the book of the Lord and God was first in their home amen amen that a contrast see we got too many things ahead of the Lord that's a tough one this is 1958 what is it in 2024 we got two many things ahead of the Lord you can't have the prayer meeting because Mr Godfrey is on TV tonight you can't have the prayer meeting because we love Lucy is on tonight or some kind of a foolish nonsense it's like that that takes up the time and we don't have time to hear the voice of the Lord you don't need me to cabbage on that brother brandham is blasting us already and those who do claim to be Christians just kneel down with a little prayer a little homemade Lord bless me bless family take care of us thank you good night next morning rise say just guide me through the day good day oh all right thank you see we first of all we do all the Talking we don't even give him a chance to talk back you have to spend some time doing that see and he says that if we would pray and pray until our soul comes into the presence of God and then just relax and listen to his voice but there's so many voices today and how there's so many voices today that takes the voice of the Lord away from us right right Eagles now Focus I don't see everybody saying amen okay okay now I'm focused right Eagles all right that's better so many voices they they so many people are listening to that see there's so many voices to take the voice of the Lord away there's a voice of pleasure so many people are listening to that where they can go home and have a good time or or where they can go and have a good time and many of them are professing to be Christians some kind of an old rock and roll coming up they just can't listen to what God say well I'm a Christian I read a Bible verse every day Jesus wept that's it go ahead but then to really get down and pray they got too many other things to do there's so many voices in the world so many things to attract our attention from God or distract our attention oh I would like to go into personal experiences he talks about that you know and and and would love to you know have personal testimonies and and and let me let me skip over some of this um and and how the Lord came and spoke to him he says oh he he is still the same Lord God and you hear him hour after hour speaking to you in your in your prayer Closet in your prayer room come out before the audience speak visible to the people the voice of God it was precious in the days of Samuel it's more precious today am for there was no open Vision Peter heard the voice and it changed his theology he went right straight to the Gentiles who he thought was a bunch of illiterate offcast but the voice of God not his teaching the voice of the Living God changed him now a much shorter quote he covers this subject again and in the voice of God in this last day is it all right you good I'm I'm going to stop here just in a minute don't what does B say I'm fitting to close don't get nervous all right the voice of God in this last day it's a very outstanding time this 1963 it's a very outstanding time we realize that where we're speaking from in the scripture there was no open Vision in the days of Samuel therefore where there's no vision the people perish we must have a vision and Visions come to the prophet and it's the word of the Lord spoken to him that's the beauty of this message because it came through a prophet so this message is the voice of God it's the vision given to a prophet see and we need the voice of God today to meet the need of the hour to meet the time that we're living in and after he has promised it we can rest assure that he will keep his promise that's the confidence that the believer has in his maker that he promised to meet the need last one absolute 1963 there was no prophet in them days to stand to the word and direct Israel so the word wasn't coming so every man did what was right in his own sight and that's about where we've gotten to again today Brethren see every man is right in his own sight say well if I want to take the Golden Rule if I want to do this on some religion I believe my religion do so and so and you find that everybody finds that God's Got Away listen to this Prophet God's Got Away the Bible say says there is a way that seeth right unto a man but the end thereof is the ways of death and there's nobody wants to die that's that's separation we don't want to separate from God a we we want to live life and he says life is the greatest treasure that man can have and now we've got to find out what is life and he Jesus said my word is life that's the life that you should have the word living in in you I've given you the problem and I've given you the solution the word living in you the vision that the prophet had is that when he you know that that to show us one of the one of the beauties that beautiful things that came out of the opening of The Seven Seals is that she is him she's no longer her and I've taught on that before she's not she's not corporally him I said I didn't die for you you don't pray to me you understand but so she's not literally him in that Corporal sense but she is the Corporal extended body he she is the word made flesh in the Earth again just like Jesus was when he walked the shores of Galilee only he was born without sin you were born in sin now brought back to a sinless condition and the plan of God rolls on she is him because Hebrews 13:8 gives us the key she's the same as him when you say she is him that's not that's really in a way just saying I'm a Christian the problem is the whole world says I'm a Christian but they're not the same as him and that's the real rub Hebrews 138 has no application in their daily life they're not him they're they're they're admiring the fine qualities of Jesus but they've never had a a heart replacement they've never come under the power of God and been made a new creation go through the Regeneration with him they the the disciples said oh yeah we can do that absolutely and Jesus said can you can you eat what I'll eat and go through what I'll go through you've got to be with me in the Regeneration yeah Lord we can do that absolutely you're going to resurrect no wait a minute hold on oh before I resurrect I first got to I first got to die wait what yeah and then I got to be buried oh hold on then I resurrect now how many want it amen she is him are those who were willing to die and be buried and then raised with him because she's got to be the continuation of the word of God she's the she's the multiplication she's the multiplied expression that's what Genesis 1 128 is pointing to he said to Adam be fruitful and multiply Hallelujah brother brandham said he already knew in spok word Original Seed he already knew nothing could multiply unless something died and so there was going to be a death and it was going to be the Lamb of God who would die for the sins of his family Hallelujah and you've got to go through the Regeneration with him and be willing to die to yourself and die to the world and be buried and the world has no more and then you're born again and renewed you resurrect with him she is him see you be come literally what the bride's image is and I'm going to close right here because I can't dare go to my next event we'll have to make it another part what you find happening is that the the family of God in this last day is now she's no longer just a part of God because they had a partial understanding but now she's the fully unveiled word of God she's all the revelation of the mystery of his person you get that so that that's why I can come here today and take a sermon like this and and and and i' I've had to just put it like brother Brandon put it and just as they say put it in the brass tax just lay it out there and say Here's contrast here's people who didn't value the word of God here's people who did what say you what say you there's people in history who valued who held his word precious and there's people who didn't what say you choose choose this day whom you will serve choose who is precious to you choose what is precious in your life amen let's stand to our feet friends choose this dayu what is precious to you praise God while the musicians come and and and and play I want you just to Bow your heads with me just for moment everybody getting to their Post Bow your heads with me for a moment Lord there was so much more word to get to and but I I I I'm okay I I feel like that's exactly you you you were in control of it you ordained everything that was said and if you give me life and if there's a tomorrow and if we're assemble again here together before your coming although we would take your coming but if we if we have a tomorrow Lord I guess today the real burden of my heart if I really bring it down to the Brass tax the real burden of this Shepherd 's heart for the people Prophet called it a burden of the word for the people and that word is this what is precious to you what what do you hold as valuable and in what order do you assign it preciousness there's many things that are precious but what is the how would you set the order if you made a list of those things what would be the order in your list would would Christ and his life would being would following him through the Regeneration be at the top of your list and if you've already accomplished that and you're already born a new in Christ then then what's at the top of your list what ought to be there is that your life would bring forth a testimony of the word of God that that would be the first and foremost things of course you're going to have other things you've got life and living and families and jobs and bills and the functions of living I get that of course we've mankind has faced that since the fall to earned by the sweat of his brow children go to school I'm all for it I love it that's not the we get jobs we get careers praise the Lord thank God for his Bounty but surely that's not at the top of your list list surely everything that you could ever want to do is under and subject to living your life and making Christ the center making him first reading his word praying communing with him letting that come out through your life and through your flesh and your life becomes an example of the Bible so that people who will never read the Bible Act will read it by reading you surely that's true friends I came here today with faith in my heart that that's true about all of us if you're here today and you've never known him in the power of his resurrection in his power and his resurrection see that's what the Bible actually says to know him in in the power and the resurrection so I don't just want to know him in power I want to know him in his resurrection and if I'm going to know him in his resurrection I got to first die and be buried could never know him in the power of His and Resurrection unless I'm willing to first die and be buried and then I can rise with him then I can live my life in fellowship with his sufferings and allow patience to have her work and allow the trials and fiery things to bring preciousness into my life Lord one day we were lost and undone we had no chance but my soul was precious in thy sight I thank you for that Lord I raise up my hands why don't we raise up hands all over the building say Lord we thank you thank you that our souls were precious in your sight thank you Lord that you didn't give me to the devil he wanted me but you wouldn't give me and he couldn't take me Lord because I belonged to you and now I've surrendered to you now the devil don't matter he can't stop me my whole life is given to you Lord my whole life in service I'm sorry Jesus for my failures I'm so sorry for my mistakes and my stupidness and stumblings my lack Lord and and and lackluster lacking sometimes Lord I I just am sorry for that help me mold me take us as a church mold us Lord renew revive rebuild Hallelujah restore us Lord God if there's any in here who have backslid and Away listen friends he's married to the backslider don't think he's forgotten those days when you loved him with fervency don't think he's forgotten that he Longs for it again he Longs for it again brother he Longs for it again sister he longs to have you back like he used to have you when you loved him and you prayed and you worshiped him and you wept and you lived and your life was a sacrifice of Christ for the whole world to see you had a beauty and a harmony with the Lord and the spirit flow flowed through you you loved hearing the word you loved reading you loved talking to the Lord he's married to you backslider he hasn't lost you he hasn't left you he hasn't divorced you he hasn't forgotten you you're inscribed on the palms of his hands he could never forget you said Can a mother forget her suckling child she might
