our voice Lord forgive us our sins and trespasses in the name of Jesus Christ we pray church say amen amen if you have your Bibles let's turn to um Matthew the 6th chapter Matthew chapter 6 6 Matthew chapter 6 we want to read um verse six and just to make the reading short let's start at uh verse 22 Matthew 6 and 22 if you haven't say Amen the light of the body is the eye if therefore thine eye be single thy whole body shall be full of light but if thine eye be evil thy whole body shall be full of Darkness if therefore the light that is in thee be Darkness how great is that Darkness let's go to Romans chapter 6 Romans chapter 6 read that ver verse 13 Romans 6 and13 the Bible says neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness Unto sin all right but yield yourselves unto God as those that are alive from the dead and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God for sin shall not have dominion over you thank God for ye are not under the law but under grace verse 19 I speak after the manner of a man because of the ministry of your flesh I mean because of the infirmity of your flesh for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity yeah unto iniquity unto iniquity even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto Holiness amen may the Lord had a blessing to the reading of his word you can have your seats amen how many glad to be in here tonight you know tonight I'm kind of going up operate as a chef all right all right kind of GNA operate as a chef tonight just to kind of give you a visual of what we're dealing with and tonight by the grace of God my subject is how do you measure up you know and I I I want you young people to understand that uhh uh you're important to the kingdom of God you know and when you go back through the scriptures you know there was a place where the children of Israel were marching through the Wilderness and the people complain and complain and God said you know what I'm not going to deal with y'all anymore I'm going to take all those young people and I'm going bring them into the promised land you know he took all the young people you know the people that the parents thought didn't understand the people that the parents may have thought were too young the people who thought that the parents were just going to be prayed God said I'm going to watch over them and I'm going to bring all of them into the promised land so you know if you just take that type Hallelujah that you are a part of the promised land but you know I I want to deal with uh how do you measure up and you know I want to talk about ingredients you know but just to give you a visual you know what this is amen this is called a measuring cup and you know this cup is used to put ingredients in to make something or to produce something and you know when we're looking at the Bible the Bible says that the light of the body is the eye and if therefore the eye be single the whole body shall be full of light so what the scripture is saying is very important what you look at hallelujah it's very important what you spend your time Hallelujah bringing it through your eyes why because your eye has a connection to the main thing I'm going to deal with tonight which is your spirit Hallelujah and you know uhh I'm sure you know the word has been preached in this place over and over and over again you know and and the fivefold ministry is here and you know HH uh I'm sure you've heard of the term Body Spirit Soul amen amen young people I see I got to walk tonight huh H y'all know I'm a walker and a talker Hallelujah but you know there's a body there's a spirit there's a soul right but tonight I don't want to deal with this I don't want to deal with your body Hallelujah because you spend a lot of time especially young girls and young men you spend a lot of time making sure the body look good all right you know you you uh no doubt tonight you put on a a a a nice pair of clothes and and and some of you sisters got your curls done and you know and some of you brothers made sure you had a line up or whatever the case is and you put on your nice shoes and your nice shirt and and the jacket and match you know you want to make sure that the body is presentable Hallelujah but you know one thing God doesn't care about your flesh come on Hallelujah you know we spend a lot of time worried about the body Hallelujah but what about your spirit H your spirit is is is if I can say it like this even more important than your body because what goes in your spirit Hallelujah will conduct how you walk in your body Hallelujah on so your spirit is very important Hallelujah and you know uhh what does it mean now I want I want you to I want you to grasp what I'm saying hallelujah there's a body there's a spirit there's a soul now catch it in between your soul and your body there's a spirit H now your spirit it can either connect in a good way to your soul or connect in a good way to your body Hallelujah cuz what's going on in your spirit is going to affect your body Hallelujah and if you don't get it right it can damn your soul yes sir Hallelujah but you know how do you measure up what's going in your spirit tonight it says that the light of the body is the eye hallelujah what are you watching what are you looking at what gets your attention you know hhhh and I'm sure you see this you know you could be riding down the road and a and and and a car pulls pulls up beside you and the music is booming and it got lights on the wheels you know they changing colors green red yellow why does that happen so you can turn and look yeah it's there to K get your attention Hallelujah and as your eye looks upon these things what the enemy is trying to do is deal with your desire oh my oh my what the enemy wants to do he wants to catch your attention by the things that can easily connect with your body Hallelujah get in your spirit then want you to Crave and desire those things wow and you say let's keep reading it says the light the same Matthew 622 it says the light of the body is the eyes so we dealing with the eyes and then it says if therefore thine eye be single then the whole body is full of light Hallelujah if you keep your eyes if you keep what you watch your whole body will have a measure of good things in it Hallelujah and did it says but if thine eye be evil see the same eye that sees good things is the same eye that can see evil things so it's up to you Hallelujah to have the right things in your spirit oh my you know in the in the Book of Mark Mark chapter 4 if you can put that up Mark chapter 4 verse uh 24 I'm G finish reading this this this verse of scripture first though it says but if thy eye be evil thy whole body be full of Darkness if therefore the light that is in thee be Darkness how how great is that Darkness see sometimes we don't realize Hallelujah by the things we watch and and what we love to look at at how dark is making you become wow wow you say well brother digs I like watching a little movie every now and then you know uh sometimes it has a little cursing in it sometimes it it has a little fornication in it oh man you know sometimes you know has a little naked girl in it or a naked boy what is that poon that's a measure of Darkness now you see this vessel started out clear but as the eye begin to partake certain things in measure the vessel got dark just a measure of it it's not all it still got some clear parts so there's still help Hallelujah all right there's still help why because it's coming in a measure Hallelujah and that's what Satan does he doesn't just you don't just Wham Hallelujah end up in a condition that's drunk and backslid and all no it starts with a measure you know Hallelujah one of our sisters one one of one one of my great mothers in the gospel she sung a song sister Lewis little by little Hallelujah little by little that's what the enemy does he gives it to you little by little Hallelujah but what what if Hallelujah whatever you know you you you watch a little something and you know and you look at it and you think you know man I should have been watching that you know man you know that that that that just ain't good for my spirit and then you repent it's about even isn't it so you starting back at Ground Zero again but somebody's going to win Hallelujah and it goes you see as a young person you don't want that life a measure of evil and a measure of good a measure of evil and a measure of good somebody has to win and we want God to win Hallelujah now it says h Mark 4 verse 24 it says everybody all right talk to me young people everybody all right see what I want you to understand is I've been where you are Hallelujah and some of you are farther ahead Hallelujah in your life where you are now than when I was when I was in your seat Hallelujah but look what God did Hallelujah God convicted me Hallelujah who Hallelujah God convicted me to get my life right Hallelujah and kept giving him a measure of measure of Grace a a measure of Love A measure peace Hallelujah and I turned out to be this kind of vessel Hallelujah Mark chapter 4 the Bible says in verse 24 he says and he said unto them take heed what you hear with what measure you meet it shall be measured to you and unto you that here shall more be given Hallelujah so Hallelujah you can also be affected in your spirit by what you hear so it's very important to be listening to the right thing hallelujah it's very important Hallelujah to have your ears Hallelujah consecrated to the things of God you say well brother digs you know uh I I like I like uh uh Christian music but it it got to have a little Twain to it watch out you got to give me a little Bumble of at Le something that I could feel see that's your body and as long as you're trying to satisfy your body you'll take things in that will corrupt your soul wow you say what brother digs you know I need something that going to make me move you do huh you say yeah I like Christian music but I like Christian rock and roll I like Christian music but I like rap gospel I like Christian music but I like a visual where you know everybody shaking their head and going crazy and beating it on the drum that's another measure now you dealing with the first measure was what came into your eyes now the second measure is coming above what you hear look at the vessel it's getting darker and darker how many with me let's measure up but what if you come to church and and the preacher's preaching and he presents a a a opportunity for you to get prayed about that thing an opportunity for you to come and say well I don't want to just listen to anything amen I want the right thing going in my spirit I want the right songs going in my spirit I want songs that can produce the Life of Christ then what's happening that's right now you have another measure of Christ Hallelujah and I hope you're catching what I'm saying your life shouldn't be a seesaw a measure of the devil a measure of God a measure of the devil a measure of God somebody's got to win Hallelujah and why not Christ why not let Christ win because there are things that connect with your spirit Hallelujah and if you let it connect too much it's going to bring other things into your spirit because what I want you to realize is hallelujah these things that I'm talking about you know music or whatever you know I I I I could I could hit ding a little bit but I'm I I think you get the point you know if if you say well brother di I I I spent I spent a little time you know maybe an hour on social media ain't nothing wrong with that I'm pouring in the good glass right are you with me I'm pour in a good glass but then that hour on social media turns into four hours that which could have been good now turns into something bad because you spent too much time and did it got in your spirit and It produced something that's no good my okay listen I ain't going to be long Hallelujah I hope y'all with me how many understand what I'm talking about what am I talking about talk to me young people I'm talking about the measure of God or the enemy in your spirit amen listen in Romans chapter 6 where dealt with the previous verses before that Paul was saying when I will do good I do evil and he said that lets me know in my good evil is present Hallelujah I want you to understand right now at this youth meeting tonight the enemy is trying to make some of you disinterested because you feel like I'm good you know I'm good I come out of a good house and you know I you know I haven't I kept my virtue haven't done anything this and that but what's in your spirit cuz you could be right in church Hallelujah and your heart not be Sanctified where you have desires for other things outside of the church Hallelujah you know what brother Jason I've watched young ladies desire to get married and get married and and they find the guy they want Hallelujah and maybe he's a Christian and goes to a good church and got good parents but that guy Hallelujah that you find cripples to God in your life that ain't the right man for you you used to sing but now you don't sing no more but you found a good Gody you used to pray but now you don't pray no more why what's happening it's a measure of the wrong thing overpowering the God in your life and really really what's happening is the enemy will pervert something that's good having a desire to have a good Christian make somebody that's equally yolked Hallelujah that's a good desire but if that person comes in and begins to Rob your spirit from a relationship with God then that's the wrong person now ask yourself Hallelujah you say yeah I got him I got her but since you've been with that person how is your relationship with God uhoh we in it now we in it now got some relationships going going on not only relationships but we got some crippling going on because that relationship is crippling Hallelujah your spirit to develop the Holiness of God the cleanliness of God remember in the Bible Hallelujah there were three that God gave talents to and some of you got talents but your talents are not on display why because there's too much of a measure of the wrong thing listen everybody all right what are ingredients ingredients are things that goes into something to make something now you ask yourself what kind of spiritual or natural ingredients I have in my life how great is per in your life that's an ingredient yes sir hallelujah how great is worship in your life that's an ingredient wow Hallelujah the things of God are you Meek are you temperate Hallelujah do you desire to be used of God these are ingredients or would you rather come to church and just be quiet and not be bothered that's also an ingredient you might be feeling right now well s just please leave me alone don't B bother me don't say that to me I don't want to hear it anymore there's something inside of you that don't want to hear it it's something that's been developed over time through the measures of Darkness you've been putting In Your Vessel all right let's go see what I'm what what I'm talking about tonight Hallelujah and and I want to make this clear what I'm talking about tonight is the making of a Christian Hallelujah and you know who you are by the things you crave and desire absolutely oh my listen ingredients are the things that are used to make something now there are ingredients in us hallelujah but what I want you to catch about the ingredients in us all the ingredients takes it away from being clear wow the ingredients that make up this and I know y'all going to laugh at me make up this Cocola Hallelujah once all the ingredients are in there it'll never be clear again it can only produce something dark how by the ingredients that come together Hallelujah now you ask yourself by the ingredients Hallelujah of your spiritual journey what kind of life are you producing but remember it's going to come by a measure you might be sitting here right now and you've been in church all your life but what are you producing you've been in church since you were a little baby Hallelujah from a little baby to now you should be a Powerhouse you know brother Tony come out scene we worshiping it but I couldn't even hear y'all right and I know I didn't seen some of y'all sing specials I didn't seen some of y'all worship Hallelujah every time we come together should be a camp meeting Hallelujah but I guarantee you if we were at the Clemson Carolina game we'll be going crazy hallelujah or whatever your team is or whoever your idol is concerning your body okay let's go what kind of ingredients are in your life now listen let's talk about the enemy what gives the devil power or should I say who gives the devil power we do the enemy is only as great as you let him be thisen what the prophet of God says everybody all right Hallelujah that was kind of weak everybody all right Hallelujah y'all never know I might have some prizes after this Hallelujah Glory Glory listen this is this is in the message um Oneness of unity he says now when the meetings going on are we in a meeting tonight we're in a youth meeting Hallelujah I want you to see how important it is to have the right Spirit he says now when the meeting's going going on an evil spirit in the meeting that spirit is almost harmless until he can catch somebody that he can work through so your problems all the things you're worried about they're no good unless you give it attention the devil can't do anything in the service tonight unless you yield what your eyes your ears your spirit to him he's harmless let's keep going you know that's kind of amazing because when you think about that thought you know a lot of times we look at our life and we say I'm unhappy because you give the enemy Hallelujah power in that area to make you unhappy that's Hallelujah you say brother DS my anxiety because you give the the enemy power in that area to produce fear everything Satan has is a perversion of truth remember it started out with a clean vessel all right but it's the things you add in as a measure that makes it dark yes sir true I believe all of you are good people hallelujah remember the prophet of God said even a fallen child of God is a child of God so God let me say like this God will always have love for you but the thing of it is you got to love him back that's why some people not going to make it because they're not able to love God back Hallelujah listen he says now when the meeting's going on the evil spirit in the meeting that Spirit almost harmless until it can catch somebody that it can work through then when it can work through it'll certainly do damage because it is an evil spirit Hallelujah see so once you give play to it it can only produce what it is this can only produce what it is hallelujah and all the things in it you know if I just drink this Hallelujah over and over and over again now it say zero sugar but yeah right Hallelujah and a lot of times we have to have faith Hallelujah in the things that are no good you say what are you saying I have to trust that this has the right in all the ingredients that they say out in here but how do I know I have to believe it by faith and you do the same thing we do the same thing Hallelujah we actually have a Measure of Faith to believe believe in the devil got youright Satan say you sick you say yeah yeah yeah I am you turn into a believer of his thoughts right you give him your faith oh my listen it says he says then then you know it'll certainly do damage because it's an evil spirit it says and the Holy Spirit is here somebody say amen amen how many knows that the devil wants to be just like God he wants to be worshiped Hallelujah he wants to have all your attention hallu he wants to be light so everything he does he got it from God first but what he does is he perverts it Hallelujah church this right here cannot be made without water it starts clear first and and then as they begin to add measures of different ingredients measures of different things measures of this and measures of fruit toast and glute coast and no ghost and South Coast and East Coast and West Coast and as it goes from coast to coast it gets darker and darker that's what we don't want to be Hallelujah and everyone in here you have a right to be this listen he said the holy spirit is here somebody say Amen trying to find somebody to work through Hallelujah wouldn't you want to be that body tonight that the Holy Spirit can work through Hallelujah and if you and if you don't have that desire it's because you have too much of us in you I've been there been in church hearing the word I'm like yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I hear you preacher but I just say ain't quite there yet that's because I had too much of the measure of the darkness inside of me but as I begin to Hallelujah lose my desire for those things it got clearer and clearer and clearer Hallelujah to where the darkness couldn't overpower me anymore Hallelujah you ask yourself why do we preach so hard about these things why do we come to you so hard about these things because we know what it means to overcome the flesh amen hallelujah and we Hallelujah there's a story that the prophet preach about a young girl I want you young girls to listen to me he said she was a young girl she grew up in a Christian home some young girls say Amen that was kind of weak she grew up in a Christian home you say but she chose a worldly boy now that worldly boy Hallelujah didn't have the same upbringing she had so what was in his Spirit was something completely different than what was in her spirit but what she had to do she had to yield to the thoughts and the actions that were in his Spirit to become what he was or either he had to yield to what was in her spirit to become what she is now which one are you doing but the story goes it says hallelujah she chose a boy that smoke why because she had two much of the wrong measure in her even though she was sitting in church oh my she chose a boy that smoked Hallelujah and he got her to smoking see if her spirit entered into the next level of Holy Spirit she could have never been overcome like that because there would have been something inside of her that would say no I was raised better than that I'm not going to do that Hallelujah and I know we all them men there Hallelujah we got friends we got worldly friends who are doing certain things even in the church they're doing certain things and there's something inside of you say no I ain't going to do that what is that that's the consciousness of God in you hallelujah oh my listen this girl she chose a boy that smoke and he got her to smoking and one night they went out on a date Hallelujah instead of giving her just a just a regular Coke he mixed up mess in it that was all so dark oh my and she couldn't tell the difference she thought she was drinking regular Coke but there was another measure of something else Hallelujah and sometimes the devil will give you something and because it might look the same there's another measure of something else in it he'll give you a nice looking boy that's in the church Hallelujah but just has a little measure of darkness and out of him that you can't see a nice looking girl who's in the church without the holy ghost that may have a measure of Darkness inside of her that you can't see can't see that's why it takes the Holy Spirit huh don't go by your flesh don't go after the things that this body going to want because you know what this body does this body is a measure of what dirt and it's going back to the dirt it has no value your body has no value that's why the the scripture says Flesh and Blood shall not inherit the kingdom of God we ever heard that before amen oh my and this boy once he gave us some Darkness he took a measure of something else some alcohol pour it in there and she couldn't tell the difference she drunk it and she started getting a little woozy and she drunk it and drunk it and kept drinking and next thing you know he took advantage of her and he stole all her virtue from her Hallelujah and it made her feel so bad CU she feel like well I'm here now I'm here now might as well continue but I want to say tonight you don't have to continue Hallelujah you don't have to continue Hallelujah all you have to do is tell the devil get back I will not go down this road with you anymore I have a greater hunger for something else Hallelujah but this girl who had no fight even though she was raised in church even though she came out of a good home Hallelujah in her spirit those things she was coming across she got to had a little desire for it and then that desire over take it went to smoking it with to drinking and the drinking Hallelujah the measure of alcohol turned into prostitution measure after measure of Darkness made the temple darker and dark and darker but she came out of a good home she was raised right she probably was sitting in church like you guys are but in her mind or in her spirit or in her ears she was intaking the wrong things that was resting up Hallelujah and you know Church she got to a place to where she smoked Hallelujah then she drank she turned into a prostitute Hallelujah next thing you know all of those measures all those measures begin to overcome her I'm going end up with us it started little by little then it turned into an overflow to where she wouldn't even fight anymore then she found herself being overcome all the way to the brim to when the prophet met her she was in the in s institution because she allowed these things by measure to get in her spirit and the prophet would talk to her and we got to find out who going to drink this now cuz we ain't going to throw it away Hallelujah now she got to a stage in her life where she didn't have any more fight now she's in the insane institution they tell her she crazy then the prophet comes with deliverance and now she's at a place where she's willing to get her spirit right even in a crazy house Hallelujah there was something inside of her saying there has to be more see all along Hallelujah she went from smoking to drinking to prostitution H from the insane institution no it was a cry for more of God but she was in taking the wrong things in my measure amen oh my oh my and we know the story The Prophet prayed for and you know her her her her testimony was you know uh she went to the uh good Shepherd's community and she went there got prayed for almost turned into a nun or whatever she did everything that looked right in the body but on the inside she still had the same Cravings she said as soon as she would get out of jail she'd go back into the same thing why there was a spirit inside out of her that's right and I want you to understand right now there's a spirit in you amen hallelujah either it's drawing you closer to God or further away from God let me say it like this brother Jason if you don't mind Hallelujah young people you can no longer this night stay neutral all right you can no longer stay neutral you have to identify yourself either it's God either it's light either it's darkness which one are you going to succumb to listen let's keep reading now we know the moral that story that young lady she got deliver when the opportunity came the prophet of God says to her he said surely you can't be a patient she said yes let me tell you my story and he's begin to tell the prophet everything that I just told you and he said you know what don't you know sister that was a devil yes sir she said brother brandham I've always believed that what am I saying even if you doing your wrong you can be conscious that it's the enemy even with the measures of wrong in your life you know you ain't right we know we ain't right I knew I wasn't right but God still called my name wo Hallelujah Adam and Eve they knew knew they wasn't right but God still called their name could it be tonight that God is calling somebody's name in all your lukewarmness listen let's put away this thing right here let's trop stop trying to satisfy this because this will never be satisfied hallelujah hallelujah you say oh brother j i I just wear a little Foundation then the foundation go from brown to orange to Red to Green you said oh brother I just I just want a little color and it and it goes from from from from light blonde to Orange to Amber to Green to Pink it starts in measures little by little listen Church you know what the enemy tries to do he'll try to make make it look like it was always that way that's what he does with the the lesbian and gay community say no I was born that way no you wasn't no you wasn't you received an evil thought then you receive another evil thought and another evil thought and another evil thought until you became a Believer and once you became a Believer all those thoughts made you what you are today and it's just like like that for us hallelujah listen everybody all right we going to get to the chicken or whatever we got back there but let's let's let's let's deal with how do you measure up tonight how is your vessel is Your Vessel dominantly clear in your spirit or is there too much Darkness Hallelujah Brother D why do you preach like this cuz I love you hallelujah amen and I I and I love to come and snatch one of my sisters away from the devil snatch one of my brothers away from the devil Hallelujah and as we're going back to God and you praying I'm looking at him say got you got you again Hallelujah you thought you had them no uhuh but I'm their brother Hallelujah I know your tactics got you Hallelujah okay listen he says the holy spirit is here trying to find somebody to work through somebody say amen and when it finds somebody to work through it can do good see the two Spirits their motives objectives watch how it is watch their works wash their fruits then you can see what spirit is on you see we don't have to have meets like this for me to tell you what you are watch your life when you leave here hallelujah when you leave here grab your phone go to your music and ask yourself can brother Jason listen to this with me grab your music and say you know you know brother Matt might be a little cooler you go to brother Matt say a brother Matt he knows me he's a good brother but put it in his ears and see if he can listen to it with you or take your phone H go to your pastor your mother or your father and go to your Netflix downloads and see if they can watch it with you Hallelujah take them to your social media Hallelujah I ain't talking about the good page where you standing there smiling like this no I'm talking about the other account under a different name with the picture like this oh my brother that's what I'm talking about when you got dual accounts I hope you parents understand Hallelujah there Hallelujah you got a good child and then you got an experienced child hallelujah oh yeah I know about them dual accounts got a good one where you got this one over here where you know under your name is like hey this is Suzy and then over here on this account this is suie cute what is it in your spirit that want you to be Hallelujah two kinds of people on Hallelujah everybody all right listen tonight is not a message of condemnation huah but one thing I've learned about God every time God correct me is for my good every time he corrects me is because he loves me so much he doesn't want me to continue in error he doesn't want me to continue in darkness oh my listen he says see the two Spirits their motives objectives watch how it is watch their Works watch their fruits then you can see what spirit is on you you are motivated by Spirit You're motivated by Spirit now ask yourself tonight are you here because the motivation was I want to hear from God or do you feel like you were forced to be here ah let me let me go ahead and go so I can keep mom and daddy off my back he said if you have a spirit it motivates your life and if your life Bears the fruit of a Christian it's a Christian Spirit Hallelujah now you may be lift you may be filled now this is one of my favorite quotes that I like to give to the young people I ain't going be too much longer everybody all right listen the message come follow me we consider ourselves to be young people amen amen hallelujah come follow me he says you make yourself when you're young I want you to understand tonight you're making something wow wow through the course of your life you're making something how by the ingredients you take it through your eyes and your ears that gets your spirit that turns you into something you make yourself when you're young you set your Ambitions Hallelujah to what you want to do amen one of the most ambitious beard that we've heard about through this decade was Kobe Bryant but even he was so ambitious with his basketball he studied everybody he did all these things he still was just a man with Hallelujah ordinary unconverted desires even though he was a great star and and and and you know he was well loved in the basketball Community he got caught in adultery even though he he scored 50 60 points and all these things his teammates say he wasn't a good teammate so even though he had measures of talent and all these other good things he still had measures of Darkness inside of him on one end he looked to be great he looked to be good Hallelujah because of his talent and then on the other end who he was on the inside made people sick oh Jesus Christ and I don't know him personally but I'm just going by the testimony of from others others that spoke on him he say ambitious to what you to do he said what you're trying to achieve in life Hallelujah you're Ambitions the things that you desire who you want to be will drive you yeah now don't let your Ambitions be solely about who you can be in this flesh let your Ambitions be who you can be in the spirit who you can be in God's kingdom because Abraham was just an ordinary man until you begin to take on and believe what God said he was Hallelujah if I could use this one before I close Samson was a great man until Hallelujah he let his flesh take over as long as he tried to operate Hallelujah by the word that God gave him he was over okay he was okay but as soon as he allowed his body to have control he failed in his spirit my listen he says you think of it and as you think of course your mind it presents it into your mind by an unknown something that dominates your mind Hallelujah I almost call this Hallelujah domination tonight I want you to understand young people where you are there's something in your life dominating you right now wow either it's God or the enemy something dominate you when you leave this church that spirit is going to come back on you and dominate you again if it's the wrong Spirit if it's God it'll increase if it's the enemy it'll increase you say and then when it becomes in your mind then you speak it Hallelujah that you're going to do do it and then your Ambitions drive you to it how do you measure up tonight this right here this Darkness it'll begin to if you get enough of us in your system it'll begin to shut down things in your body that was once operating right and when you get too much Darkness Inside by measure it'll begin to shut down things in your life that once God could use ask yourself ask yourself right now over the course of the of the past couple months how much of God have you really surrendered to you can ask yourself that your parents know your pastor know different ones may know who are close to you and are watching you they they they can they can they can see the dominating force in your life H you say oh praise God brother digs I have a good job but how much of that job is dominating your spirit you say oh brother digs you know I'm in a good place of school and and and I'm getting my book work and how much of that knowledge is dominating who you are in closing everybody all right we love those words inclosing Hallelujah in closing this is what the prophet of God says and I'm going to break into the of this quote this is in uh uh Waters of Separation Hallelujah can't we see don't we see Sodom on the earth talk to me young people see unlike your day my day my day brother even even more than brother Jason's day hallelujah hallelujah when he was a child coming up you couldn't walk around like people walk around today why because there was more of a consciousness of God but now because of the measure of Darkness that's been given to be okay the consciousness of God hallelujah you got to look for it now Hallelujah there was a time when a woman wouldn't wear pants to church even in a Baptist or a Methodist or a Pentecostal Church they wouldn't come like that why out of reverence to God but now the measures of these things have come in and made it dark and dark and everybody's like it's all right you know one thing about this Hallelujah one thing about this Hallelujah I want you to catch this the more you drink it the better it'll taste and you'll said you'll be thirsty because being thirsty is it's something natural Hallelujah but you're really not thirsting for this you're thirsting for this but but because this tastes better you'll run to this every time it'll become like second nature remember it starts out how that wasn't everybody it starts out how starts out how okay I don't want to hear a Brothers I want hear a sisters starts out how a that was weak sister I know you soft spoken that's good it starts out by just a measure and then you get more and more and more hallelujah how many of you sisters like cooking no don't raise your hand but you know when a you young Brothers may not do much cooking but you know let's just say Bing a cake huah you can use the same measuring cup to put in the ingredients two teaspoons of this and four teaspoon of that and this and milk and eggs and cream and butter and all that into a cake right trying to bake a cake you need all the right ingredients if you got the right ingredients you get the cake but what if you leave out one ingredient you're not going to get the product that you're looking for and I wonder how many of us tonight how many young people across the globe are leaving out ingredients listen the prophet of God say it behooves you to check your spiritual condition every hour of the day and be ready for you don't know what the time is coming God has made a way Oh my he said he sending everything the preaching of the word signs wonders he's give one message of preaching another signs message he said another thing not willing that any should perish God don't want nobody in this room to be lost but you got to have a will and a want to to move on with God he said his gifts in order in the church and so forth and still people continually made right on through and just like that didn't even pay any attention to it and I'm sure what I've said tonight you've heard it before maybe in a different way cuz there's only one brother digs you've heard it before amen but are you listening and one thing about God he'll bring it back why because he knows somebody's not doing it what is that that's his Mercy Hallelujah that's his Mercy he loves you so much he'll keep saying to you over and over and over again why because he wants you to get it he wants you to understand that he loves you and you're a child of God don't just brush him off because God ain't going no way Hallelujah and in my closing Hallelujah think about how do you measure up let's just say right now Hallelujah I was the boss of everyone in this room Hallelujah and you were going to receive wages by how you receive what I preach tonight and God showed me in the spirit each and every individual in this room how you receive what I preach tonight you think you have a big check or a small check you know you might want a big check but I said wages based upon what you receive and how you received it not what you want what are you doing with it Hallelujah because you go to a job Hallelujah they don't just give out free checks at Chick-fil-A no you got to work Hallelujah that drive-thru ain't moving that fast for nothing you got the work they got people moving that chicken moving them fries Hallelujah you got the work and when it comes to your spiritual journey you got to have measures of God in your life Hallelujah constant measures of God constant measures of God hallelujah because this flesh wants that am the spirit man think about your spirit come on musicians I'm closing if they only realized that in their soul was a spirit of the devil that was dominating their life then it can't be something else this is not a night or a message of Doom and Gloom but let's be aware Hallelujah that the enemy is not just going to let you sweep or walk your way into heaven no you got to fight for it Hallelujah you got to fight for it amen and you can't wait Hallelujah to October to the camp meeting for you to get on fire for God no it starts with a daily communication with God say Brother D I don't know how to pray you got the star somewhere brother I'm a little shy you got to come out your cell sometimes Hallelujah you got to ask God and say think about it the prophet of God I believe it was the prophet who said he didn't even know how to talk to God he would just go out there and say Mr God and I think of one place they uh it was somebody who just just begin to say ABCs or something to that effect amen see God God's not looking for us to be somebody big and great he's looking for us to be sincere [Music] Hallelujah that's what God wants he wants us to really really really spend the time or take the time to get to know him let's pray pray Lord Jesus father here we are Lord and we know how real you are and Lord as this word is going forth Lord we pray that it will find the proper resting ground Lord Lord that we don't just brush you off
