[42:02] and i said well praise the lord the lord
[42:05] he just starts you just start feeling
[42:06] that anointing and i can't explain it
[42:09] but if you're a minister you know what
[42:10] i'm talking about
[42:13] but you know i wanted to uh talk tonight
[42:15] a little bit and i've heard a lot of
[42:17] different ministers and um
[42:19] it's it's been a real pleasure being
[42:21] here in the past few weeks that we've
[42:23] been here thank you brother
[42:25] i'm already dry
[42:27] um
[42:28] it's been a real pleasure coming here
[42:29] and
[42:30] and being a part of this little assembly
[42:35] i didn't bring my fellowship card though
[42:39] well yeah
[42:40] we're not supposed to need one of those
[42:41] are we
[42:42] not supposed to anyway
[42:44] but sometimes you feel like that the
[42:46] spirit's kind of starting to creep in a
[42:47] little bit you know
[42:49] the uh
[42:50] amongst uh some of the churches and and
[42:52] uh if you don't believe this doctrine
[42:54] and you don't believe there's a little
[42:55] certain thing to kind of
[42:56] draw a little circle and just draw you
[42:58] right out and
[42:59] i tell you what brother i'm a good
[43:01] circle drawer i i've just always just
[43:03] drew them right back in if i if i can
[43:06] some of them just don't want to be drawn
[43:07] in though
[43:09] ah well that's for no more we don't we
[43:11] don't want you over there so
[43:13] but i love them anyway amen
[43:15] but uh
[43:16] so i'm just glad to be here tonight glad
[43:19] main thing is we want to see what the
[43:21] lord is going to tell us
[43:23] now i want to read a
[43:25] vision that brother branham had
[43:27] and i of all the things i thought i
[43:29] remembered i forgot my glasses
[43:32] but i think i'll be good i've got it um
[43:35] i've got it pulled up here so
[43:38] i want to start off with telling about a
[43:40] vision that brother branham had
[43:42] and
[43:43] he had you know many times he would talk
[43:45] about having a vision and if everything
[43:47] wasn't exactly in the place it wouldn't
[43:49] it wouldn't happen it would have come to
[43:50] pass
[43:51] in this particular time he was talking
[43:53] about the vision they had a little boy
[43:55] that was um
[43:57] his arms were all twisted up his legs
[43:59] were all twisted up
[44:00] and and so when he saw him he had double
[44:02] pneumonia and he's his father backslid
[44:05] and he came and talked to him and so
[44:07] brother branham had already told the
[44:09] story of how he went there and how he
[44:11] just you know the lord had already
[44:12] showed that the little boy was going to
[44:13] be healed he said just go there and and
[44:15] it'll be and so he goes and immediately
[44:17] grabs a little baby up he's about three
[44:19] or four years old and picks him up and
[44:21] and and says in the name of jesus christ
[44:23] be well when nothing happened he got
[44:24] worse
[44:25] see
[44:26] and he said you see i got ahead of the
[44:28] vision
[44:30] and so
[44:31] we don't want to get ahead of god's
[44:32] vision do we
[44:34] so he's talking to brother vale he said
[44:35] brother vale if this
[44:37] if this uh pad was supposed to be laying
[44:40] here i can't say a word till that pad is
[44:42] laid there see has to be just that way
[44:45] it showed me
[44:46] so i said bring me the baby and the
[44:48] daddy brought the baby to me and i
[44:50] prayed for it and it got worse so i
[44:52] thought now something it really lost its
[44:54] breath and they had to fight and shake
[44:56] and everything get breath in it i
[44:58] thought now there's something wrong and
[45:00] i happen to think where's the old woman
[45:03] that wasn't there yet so they take the
[45:05] baby laid it down they was putting stuff
[45:06] under his nose everything and crying the
[45:09] mother screaming hysterically and
[45:10] everything but the baby was just barely
[45:12] breathing boy i wouldn't have wanted to
[45:14] be right there at that time because i
[45:16] mean they had most confidence in brother
[45:18] branham and then he goes and he prays
[45:20] for the baby and he gets worse and the
[45:21] mama's crying upset and he's like oh my
[45:23] goodness
[45:25] the baby got worse just barely breathing
[45:28] i thought well
[45:29] through my stupidity
[45:31] i have misused the vision of god because
[45:34] i never waited on it being so over
[45:36] excited
[45:37] we ever wonder if we've ever done that
[45:39] before
[45:40] by this you can see brother veil why i
[45:42] wait i don't care who tells me i love
[45:45] you as my brother brother don't never
[45:47] try tell me something to do when i feel
[45:50] that i've got the will of the lord see
[45:52] no matter how well it looks the other
[45:55] way
[45:57] see how well it looks see i see never
[45:59] try
[46:01] i've got the will of the lord no matter
[46:03] how well it looks the other way i'll
[46:05] wait for him see and so i learned a
[46:07] lesson right there many many years ago
[46:10] and to do exactly what he says and don't
[46:13] do it till he says it's ready to be done
[46:16] i said mr emma i said mr emil you still
[46:19] have confidence in me as a servant of
[46:21] christ
[46:22] now this is after everything got into
[46:24] place
[46:24] he had to wait for the woman to come
[46:26] there the hat was laid in a certain way
[46:30] said you have confidence in me as a
[46:32] servant of christ he said i sure do
[46:34] brother branham i said can i tell you
[46:36] now i spoke ahead of the vision a while
[46:37] ago that's why it didn't happen if you
[46:40] still got confidence in me go bring your
[46:42] baby oh my i see
[46:44] i see it was right then you see
[46:47] go bring me your baby he said i'll do
[46:49] anything you tell me to do brother bill
[46:51] i wouldn't be afraid to pick it up
[46:53] because they pick it up it just went the
[46:55] breath all together left it brought the
[46:57] little baby up to me reached and got it
[46:59] in his arms brought it up to me and
[47:01] stood there i put my hand on it lord
[47:03] forgive the stupidity of your servant
[47:06] see i spoke ahead of your vision but now
[47:09] let it be known that your god of heavens
[47:12] and earth
[47:13] no more said that the little baby throw
[47:15] both arms around his daddy began
[47:17] screaming and crying saying daddy i feel
[47:19] all right now
[47:22] now see there's something to be said
[47:25] about that and i've i've i've read that
[47:27] many many many times
[47:28] and i know that brother branham said
[47:30] that like everything had to be just
[47:31] perfect in a perfect order before that
[47:34] would take place
[47:36] now the thing about what we're
[47:39] what we're looking at today
[47:42] is that never before
[47:45] have we had such a detailed explanation
[47:48] of visions
[47:50] than in this day we've we've read about
[47:53] them in the bible and we you know
[47:54] ezekiel had them and and and different
[47:56] ones jeremiah had them different ones
[47:59] but we never had anybody that actually
[48:01] said and try to explain to us
[48:03] what
[48:04] the detail about a vision
[48:06] daniel had a vision that was troubled
[48:08] many days at his head but it didn't
[48:10] really say what they were
[48:12] but we had a prophet to come and tell us
[48:15] that that what the vision was if we can
[48:18] understand this tonight is that god was
[48:21] allowing the prophet to see through his
[48:23] own eyes
[48:25] he was seeing the very mind of god
[48:28] and that's where we're at tonight
[48:30] if we can ever catch the vision of the
[48:32] very mind of god
[48:34] and so
[48:35] how privileged are we tonight amen
[48:39] when i start to think about that why
[48:41] couldn't it just have happened
[48:43] why couldn't the baby just gotten well
[48:45] because god already said it was going to
[48:46] be well but he was looking through god's
[48:49] eyes
[48:50] and it had not happened yet
[48:52] he couldn't get ahead of that no matter
[48:54] what we try to do in our life
[48:56] it's got to be in god's time
[48:59] we can't get a hold of we can't get
[49:00] ahead of the vision amen
[49:04] i'm so glad that we can hear his voice
[49:06] tonight aren't you
[49:09] when the world is hung up on a man
[49:12] see
[49:13] we hear the voice
[49:15] and we see what god brought to us
[49:18] through a prophet
[49:19] in our day
[49:22] we we know what the what the visions are
[49:25] we know when he said
[49:27] never one time did ever fell well they
[49:30] couldn't fail
[49:31] because they wanted brother brown's
[49:32] visions to start with they're god's
[49:34] visions
[49:35] that he was allowed to see
[49:37] the very mind of god
[49:40] now the rest of the world can't see it
[49:42] they don't believe it because they're
[49:44] hung up on the man amen
[49:46] they're hung up on on a little kentucky
[49:48] prophet or a little kentucky hillbilly
[49:50] that didn't have any education
[49:53] and
[49:53] so
[49:54] they're hung up on him
[49:56] and so we can also bring that down to
[49:58] the extreme in the message some people
[50:00] get hung up on him too
[50:02] the other way
[50:04] that's all they can see
[50:06] and miss what god's doing now in his
[50:08] church
[50:10] they say oh what he did back 50 years
[50:12] ago what he did back 60 years ago
[50:15] and i thank god for that
[50:17] where were you i was asking brother
[50:18] jason in the back where would we be
[50:20] tonight without this message
[50:24] i don't know where i would be i really
[50:26] don't
[50:27] i might be out in the world on a beach
[50:29] somewhere with a beer in my hand
[50:32] i might be a apostolic it might be a
[50:33] pentecost i don't know where i would be
[50:36] but i'm so glad that god sent this
[50:38] message
[50:40] hey man
[50:41] and i'm not hung up on the man
[50:44] i love him i respect him we should all
[50:47] give him respect and due diligence amen
[50:51] due respect to him
[50:53] but all the glory goes to god
[50:56] see
[50:57] everybody wants to put it back on well
[50:59] we don't need the preachers anymore
[51:02] see the fifo ministries failed all we
[51:04] need is just put the tapes on that's all
[51:06] we need
[51:09] well there's a lot of truth to that
[51:13] just like any doctrine and it's no more
[51:15] than a doctrine
[51:17] every doctrine that's ever come out
[51:19] there's a little bit of truth to it see
[51:22] and we've all many of us have come up in
[51:24] this message we've been acquainted with
[51:25] so many different doctrines and i can
[51:27] start naming them off and and i'd
[51:29] probably
[51:31] run out of time tonight
[51:33] because there's so many different
[51:34] doctrines a brother might read in the
[51:36] seal book and get a little revelation or
[51:38] get a little opinion is what i honestly
[51:40] think it is mostly opinion and then
[51:42] they'll run off and start a little uh
[51:44] little sect over here and and say well
[51:46] now if you this is it right here this is
[51:48] i got a picture of the toe you know i
[51:50] got to pick the you joined the the the
[51:53] toe group over here
[51:55] i got a picture of the knee now now and
[51:57] now we got more revelation but this is
[51:59] all you got to come over here this is it
[52:02] and i grew up in a church that that um
[52:05] oh that was on the other extreme of the
[52:07] spectrum don't listen to tapes at all
[52:10] see
[52:11] uh just get rid of them get the
[52:13] revelation from me because god's put put
[52:15] me in this place to to break the word to
[52:18] you so you don't need the tape see
[52:20] and and you're wrong on both ends see
[52:24] we got to stay right down the middle
[52:28] keep that balance
[52:29] amen
[52:32] now
[52:34] we have a balance
[52:36] no there's no way we'd ever know these
[52:38] mysteries without brother branham
[52:40] amen never know the mysteries how in the
[52:43] world we were just talking about that
[52:45] great educated men
[52:47] they they said and they go through the
[52:49] greek and they go through the latin and
[52:50] they go through all these things and the
[52:52] best that they can produce is a million
[52:54] miles away from what god has for this
[52:57] bride to get us ready for
[52:58] rapture all of the denominations
[53:01] combined
[53:02] and jehoshaphat before he went up uh to
[53:05] ahab wanted to go and push out the
[53:07] syrians and he said um they're eating
[53:10] our children's food and and joshua well
[53:12] i brother i'll join you i'll go with you
[53:13] but i want i want a word from the lord
[53:16] and they brought out 400 men oh yeah go
[53:19] go it's fine go before you have the gods
[53:22] give you that land you go
[53:24] and then another one said he made a
[53:26] horns of iron said this is what you'll
[53:28] push the enemy out with and
[53:30] and jehoshaphat said well don't you have
[53:32] just one more
[53:33] just one more
[53:35] see
[53:36] he waited on the word from the lord the
[53:38] rest of them just was impulsive
[53:40] see it wasn't according to the vision
[53:42] had to be according to the vision
[53:45] now
[53:48] the message is jesus christ today
[53:52] but we have to stay in god's program
[53:55] see david got out of god's program
[53:58] he wanted to bring the ark back to
[53:59] jerusalem he got all stirred up and got
[54:02] all excited about it brother brown said
[54:04] he danced and he and had all kind of
[54:06] religion
[54:07] but he failed to to consult the men of
[54:10] god right now
[54:11] he consulted all the other people he
[54:13] consulted the other kings and the and
[54:15] the governors in the military they said
[54:17] oh it'll be great
[54:18] go get it
[54:20] but see when he brought the ark back
[54:23] he put it on a man-made system
[54:26] he put it on a new cart brother random
[54:28] said that he put it on a new
[54:29] denomination is what he did
[54:32] the word of god
[54:33] and god wasn't even in it
[54:36] he was supposed to put it on the
[54:38] shoulders of the levites
[54:40] the word is to be handled by men of god
[54:43] not by a man-made system
[54:45] see that's where david got off
[54:48] cost a man his life
[54:50] why because he didn't consult the word
[54:52] of god
[54:54] he didn't consult the lord
[54:56] amen now we can hear some things that
[54:58] says well you know this sounds okay
[55:01] and and uh just to do this over here uh
[55:03] it sounds okay but what does god's word
[55:05] say about it
[55:07] i don't want to take any man's word if
[55:09] it doesn't line up with god's word
[55:11] i don't care what he calls himself
[55:13] prophet potentate whatever he might be
[55:15] yeah amen
[55:17] it's got to line up with god's word amen
[55:21] now
[55:22] let's turn to genesis 2 18.
[55:26] this is all right this morning shouting
[55:27] too loud emma
[55:30] i don't need a microphone brother luther
[55:34] i've been told that before
[55:40] not by brother loser
[55:43] genesis 2 18.
[55:45] now when god made everything and he
[55:48] rested and he made everything every day
[55:50] he said that it was good
[55:52] he made he made all the ocean anybody
[55:54] the seas made the mountains and
[55:55] everything he said is that that was good
[55:58] but now let's see if i can find 218 here
[56:01] there we go
[56:03] this pulpit ain't low enough and the
[56:05] lord god said it is not good that the
[56:08] man should be alone
[56:09] i will make and help me for him
[56:12] so that was the only thing that god
[56:13] looked and saw that wasn't good that
[56:16] adam was alone
[56:20] and i heard brother aaron preach that
[56:22] when he was here and it really stuck
[56:24] home with me
[56:25] and i began really looking at what he
[56:28] was talking about
[56:29] and it goes right back to the vision of
[56:32] the mind of god
[56:33] of what he saw when he created adam
[56:36] because adam was living in a perfect
[56:38] state of of harmony with nature he was a
[56:41] in his theophany form when he walked on
[56:43] the earth but it was no man until the
[56:44] soul so god said he he uh made him in
[56:46] the flesh and he formed him up out of
[56:48] the soul out of the dust of the earth
[56:50] and then out of that came eve
[56:53] but see
[56:54] adam might have thought that he was in a
[56:56] perfect state and just looking at adam
[56:59] he was a beautiful man no doubt he was
[57:02] handsome the most perfect man that ever
[57:04] was up to that time and god had just
[57:06] created him there was no sin there was
[57:08] no pollution there was nothing he was a
[57:10] perfect man according to what we would
[57:13] say but god looked at him and said it's
[57:15] not good that he's alone
[57:17] and and so now adam probably would have
[57:18] thought to himself well i'm doing just
[57:20] fine until he saw eve but the reason why
[57:23] he wasn't perfect
[57:25] it's because
[57:27] the word perfect actually comes from the
[57:29] latina and i looked it up perfection
[57:31] see he was almost perfect but the
[57:34] original definition of perfection comes
[57:36] from latin it means to complete
[57:39] or professier uh i believe that's how
[57:42] you pronounce it perfecieri
[57:45] it means to be completed
[57:47] so adam wasn't completed right without
[57:50] his bride amen now he might have looked
[57:52] beautiful and he might have had
[57:55] everything going for him but it wasn't
[57:57] completed
[57:58] now just like an artist can paint a
[58:00] picture like the the hoffman head of
[58:02] christ and so he he paints the the poor
[58:05] people in the background the the beggar
[58:07] and he's and he's there and then maybe
[58:09] he paints he paints christ and then he
[58:11] paints the rich young ruler and you look
[58:13] at it it's beautiful you're looking at
[58:15] the picture and say well that's perfect
[58:17] christ is perfect the the the thatched
[58:20] roof and the stone he's got it just
[58:22] perfect in the way that the masons would
[58:24] have cut the stone and everything and
[58:25] even the way he's holding his hands he's
[58:27] you can tell he was a carpenter and and
[58:29] uh and the rich young ruler how he's got
[58:32] the robe on and everything is perfect
[58:35] but then the artist would step back and
[58:36] say no it's not perfect yet there's
[58:38] still something left and then maybe he
[58:40] goes up and he he paints the blue ribbon
[58:43] along the the hat of the rich young
[58:45] ruler and and you know they were they
[58:46] were um and the blue along the ribbon uh
[58:49] the blue ribbon which was the numbers 15
[58:51] which they were uh god commanded them to
[58:54] to do and so he put the blue ribbon on
[58:56] there and so now
[58:58] now it's perfect see
[59:00] see perfection is in the eyes of the
[59:03] artist of the man who completed the
[59:05] picture so so he finishes painting it
[59:08] then he steps back and says now it's
[59:10] completed amen
[59:12] oh my
[59:14] so perfection
[59:16] means completion it means perfection
[59:19] it means completion amen
[59:22] now turn to hebrews 11.
[59:26] and i'm not a long-winded preacher
[59:32] but i got a quote that brother ram said
[59:34] that uh
[59:35] he said don't wear the people out
[59:39] he said he said peter preached a
[59:41] 15-minute sermon on the day of pentecost
[59:44] and won 3 000 souls of christ
[59:47] i should have got amen out all of y'all
[59:49] on that one
[59:51] i got a wow
[59:54] ain't that what he said brother jason
[59:56] what are you saying amen
[59:59] hebrews 11. now let's turn this look at
[1:00:01] verse 40.
[1:00:03] well i'll tell you what let's let's go
[1:00:04] down to verse 37 4 uh first because i
[1:00:07] like to set the stage of what he's
[1:00:09] talking about here
[1:00:10] he says they were stoned they were sawn
[1:00:12] asunder
[1:00:14] they were tempted
[1:00:17] were
[1:00:18] slain with the sword
[1:00:20] they wandered about in sheepskins and
[1:00:21] goat skins being destitute afflicted
[1:00:24] tormented
[1:00:25] of whom the world was not worthy they
[1:00:28] wandered in deserts and in mountains and
[1:00:29] in dens and caves of the earth and these
[1:00:32] all having obtained a good report
[1:00:34] through faith received not the promise
[1:00:37] see god having provided some better
[1:00:40] thing for us
[1:00:41] that they without us should not be made
[1:00:43] perfect
[1:00:45] i think they were pretty much perfect
[1:00:48] i feel like they were
[1:00:50] the world was not even i believe right
[1:00:51] here brother
[1:00:53] paul said of whom the world was not
[1:00:54] worthy
[1:00:55] that what he said
[1:00:58] of whom the world
[1:01:00] was not worthy verse 38
[1:01:03] they wandered in deserts in the
[1:01:04] mountains and in dens and caves of the
[1:01:07] earth
[1:01:08] and these all having obtained a good
[1:01:10] report through faith received not the
[1:01:12] promise god having provided some better
[1:01:15] thing for us that they without us should
[1:01:17] not be made perfect
[1:01:21] now
[1:01:23] we know what he's talking about here
[1:01:26] they were they were perfected in christ
[1:01:29] but they weren't completed without us
[1:01:32] because god had a vision in his mind
[1:01:35] and the vision was a completed church
[1:01:38] started from the foundation at ephesus
[1:01:41] going all the way up
[1:01:43] and so when we look back and we say well
[1:01:46] they well they weren't perfect without
[1:01:48] us well neither are we without them you
[1:01:50] see because where will we be without
[1:01:53] them laying the foundation and coming on
[1:01:55] up
[1:01:56] so you you can't you can't say well we
[1:01:58] don't need these stones over here
[1:02:00] absolutely we need those stones over
[1:02:01] there
[1:02:02] you can't say that we don't need
[1:02:03] speaking in tongues anymore when god put
[1:02:06] it in the church you can't say that we
[1:02:08] don't need prophecies anymore you say
[1:02:10] you can't say we don't need the fivefold
[1:02:12] ministry anymore yes we had a perfect
[1:02:14] word yes we had a perfect message that
[1:02:17] came with a prophet a man sent from god
[1:02:21] but it doesn't take away from what god
[1:02:22] has already put into the church
[1:02:25] see because god in his mind had another
[1:02:27] vision out ahead
[1:02:30] and so we're just fulfilling that part
[1:02:32] of the vision that it wasn't that they
[1:02:34] were not perfect it's that things
[1:02:36] weren't completed yet until god brought
[1:02:39] us
[1:02:40] into the picture
[1:02:42] see adam was perfect but he wasn't
[1:02:44] completed until eve was brought into the
[1:02:46] picture amen see
[1:02:48] and so oh my can i say this
[1:02:52] that god knew exactly how adam felt
[1:02:56] because he dwelled alone brother brown
[1:02:58] said with his thoughts he was uh he was
[1:03:00] the uh god the logos the elohim the i am
[1:03:04] that i am he he dwelt but he had in his
[1:03:07] mind the attributes and he had a vision
[1:03:10] of every one of us sitting here tonight
[1:03:12] he had a vision of his bride and every
[1:03:15] every believer that ever lived and
[1:03:17] trusted in him he had in his mind and
[1:03:19] every one of those has to be manifested
[1:03:21] it has to take place
[1:03:24] one time i was talking to a man and he
[1:03:26] was talking about abraham
[1:03:29] and he said he didn't believe that god
[1:03:31] knew all things
[1:03:33] he said i said what do you mean he said
[1:03:35] god doesn't know the end from the
[1:03:36] beginning i said what do you mean he
[1:03:38] said when he commanded abraham to slay
[1:03:40] isaac
[1:03:41] and when he lifted up his knife to kill
[1:03:43] him he stopped them and said now i know
[1:03:47] that you'll obey me and do all that i've
[1:03:49] commanded you see
[1:03:51] and he does say that the bible does say
[1:03:53] that
[1:03:54] but you see
[1:03:56] that's coming from an unbeliever to
[1:03:57] start with
[1:03:59] because
[1:04:01] what god was saying
[1:04:03] and i hope i can convey this to you
[1:04:06] that god's whole plan wants to manifest
[1:04:08] you and i what's the manifest sons and
[1:04:11] daughters of god that's going to believe
[1:04:12] him and to worship him he made the
[1:04:14] angels first he made adam to walk in
[1:04:16] perfectness and pureness and eve too
[1:04:18] then sin got in the mix of it amen
[1:04:22] so then the attribute of being a savior
[1:04:24] had to come the attribute of being a
[1:04:26] redeemer had to be manifested
[1:04:28] so all these things were being
[1:04:30] manifested and even well uh when but
[1:04:33] before god said it wasn't good for adam
[1:04:35] to be alone
[1:04:36] he brought he was bringing animals to
[1:04:38] him and and god and the bible says to
[1:04:41] see what adam would name them well why
[1:04:44] would god have to see he already knew
[1:04:47] he already knew exactly what he's going
[1:04:48] to do but
[1:04:50] for the first time he was now having
[1:04:52] fellowship with his creation
[1:04:54] the creator was experiencing the
[1:04:57] fellowship of the creation
[1:04:59] and for the first time
[1:05:02] when he saw abraham obeyed him in all
[1:05:04] things he said now i know now i have
[1:05:07] experienced this absolute obedience from
[1:05:11] a true son of god amen
[1:05:13] now i know now i see god knew him but
[1:05:16] now he knows experientially
[1:05:18] he's experienced it now
[1:05:24] praise be unto god amen amen
[1:05:30] that was in god's mind in his vision
[1:05:33] that he had
[1:05:34] but you and i are still somewhere in
[1:05:37] that vision tonight oh yes amen you see
[1:05:40] because john saw a spotless bride
[1:05:43] john looked into the very mind of god
[1:05:45] amen and he saw a spotless bride
[1:05:49] going to have somebody that's going to
[1:05:51] overcome in this day
[1:05:54] oh
[1:05:56] raise your hand if you're an overcomer
[1:05:57] tonight god's going to have somebody see
[1:06:00] you overcome by the war by the blood of
[1:06:02] the lamb and the word of your testimony
[1:06:05] who's an overcomer tonight
[1:06:08] i am an overcomer
[1:06:10] you're an overcomer
[1:06:12] it's not by my power but it's by the
[1:06:15] lord it's by the blood of the lamb and
[1:06:17] the word of your testimony
[1:06:20] see i talked to a little fella the other
[1:06:22] day he came to church
[1:06:23] up at brother david's just uh he didn't
[1:06:26] know anything about the lord he said i'm
[1:06:28] trying he said i'm coming and he said he
[1:06:30] said i want the lord to live in me he
[1:06:32] said and he said you know what he said
[1:06:34] he's going to to be living in me more i
[1:06:37] said right there you go i said that
[1:06:39] testimony right there
[1:06:41] i said keep that testimony never lose
[1:06:44] that you stay in fellowship with these
[1:06:46] brothers and sisters you keep around
[1:06:48] this fellowship
[1:06:50] stay here
[1:06:51] and then keep that testimony that he's
[1:06:53] going to be living in me more and more
[1:06:55] and more and more no matter how many
[1:06:57] times i fall let me tell you something
[1:06:59] i've failed so many times
[1:07:01] i've faltered
[1:07:03] but you know what what's the difference
[1:07:04] in a in a quitter
[1:07:07] and me
[1:07:08] the difference is i get back up amen
[1:07:12] we all get knocked down but when you're
[1:07:14] up you're up
[1:07:15] and the devil can look at you and he
[1:07:16] don't know what to do with you i hit him
[1:07:18] with everything i had an old uh screw
[1:07:21] loose or whatever them demons are there
[1:07:23] they're coming up just uh all bruised up
[1:07:25] and while i was in a battle i thought i
[1:07:27] had him down and like an mma they got
[1:07:29] him on the ground he'd say oh boy this
[1:07:30] is it but all of a sudden he comes back
[1:07:32] up fighting swinging somehow or another
[1:07:35] god give me that kind of
[1:07:37] resilience
[1:07:38] like uncle buddy robinson said he said
[1:07:40] give me a backbone like a saw log give
[1:07:43] me galvanized bridges how many knows
[1:07:44] that pole brother around talked about
[1:07:46] give me a wagon load of gumption up to
[1:07:48] the gable end of my soul
[1:07:50] let me fight the devil till i don't have
[1:07:52] a tooth left and then gum him till i die
[1:07:54] that's why i said that's the testimony
[1:07:56] that i want
[1:07:57] put it on my tombstone he fought the
[1:07:59] devil till he didn't have a tooth left
[1:08:01] and then he gummed him till i until he
[1:08:03] died
[1:08:05] if i have a if i have a tombstone
[1:08:08] amen brother i believe i'm looking at
[1:08:10] people that never see one
[1:08:13] i'm looking at a glorious bride that
[1:08:15] god's getting ready for a rapture
[1:08:16] tonight
[1:08:18] just might as well be you
[1:08:21] hey man
[1:08:22] why not why not be you
[1:08:27] i'm tired of taking the devil's uh
[1:08:30] who hit john or whatever it is he's
[1:08:31] trying to feed us
[1:08:35] it keeps me beat down enough
[1:08:37] i don't need to give him no help
[1:08:41] oh my
[1:08:42] but here's the thing about it you know
[1:08:44] what what you know what the problem is
[1:08:48] many believers don't realize what we are
[1:08:51] you don't realize the potential that
[1:08:53] you've got the devil knows what you got
[1:08:55] the devil knows your potential
[1:08:58] see
[1:08:59] he knows exactly what he's got he he bit
[1:09:01] into a million votes at calvary he
[1:09:03] thought he had him see he thought that
[1:09:06] this man who called himself the son of
[1:09:07] god i'm getting ahead of myself
[1:09:10] he thought he had him there when he
[1:09:11] lifted him up off the ground
[1:09:13] he was lifted up and hung on a tree
[1:09:15] cursed as every man that hangs on a tree
[1:09:17] he thought he had him there
[1:09:19] but he didn't realize what he'd done
[1:09:22] see
[1:09:23] i want to go back to possession
[1:09:25] and i'll get back to the thought it's
[1:09:27] going to have here in just a second
[1:09:29] but the possession like the brothers say
[1:09:31] a lot of times footsteps mean possession
[1:09:33] and it's true if you go back in the book
[1:09:35] of ruth when when boaz who was i i just
[1:09:39] believed he was a he was a uh have you
[1:09:41] ever heard of a poker face somebody's
[1:09:43] got a poker face you don't know what
[1:09:44] they're thinking
[1:09:45] boaz must have had one of those because
[1:09:48] let me tell you something he wanted ruth
[1:09:50] from the first time he saw her hey man
[1:09:52] he wanted everybody he played it cool i
[1:09:55] i i hear some of these young guys they
[1:09:56] say oh dad hey dad you gotta well i'll
[1:09:59] just give it away but never mind i hear
[1:10:01] some of these other young guys and
[1:10:02] they'll say uh dad he said you can't you
[1:10:04] can't act like you you know you gotta
[1:10:06] you gotta be cool about so okay all
[1:10:08] right i i got you
[1:10:10] so so boaz saw ruth and he wanted her
[1:10:14] but yet he knew there was another
[1:10:16] kinsmen see
[1:10:17] so he had to play his cards right hey
[1:10:19] man god forgive me for using that kind
[1:10:21] of a a an analogy but just to get you to
[1:10:24] understand what i'm saying so he had to
[1:10:25] play his cards right so what'd he do he
[1:10:27] got the kinsmen at the gate of the city
[1:10:30] and the gate was was their legal binding
[1:10:34] uh courtrooms that's where all the
[1:10:36] elders would come
[1:10:37] and and and the bible says that boaz had
[1:10:40] the elders to sit down and he had the
[1:10:42] near kinsmen there and and he must have
[1:10:44] really he was like um so he played it
[1:10:47] right so he says uh hey um let's just
[1:10:50] call his name joe all right he was a
[1:10:52] kinsman hey joe this is boaz so what
[1:10:55] about that piece of property over there
[1:10:57] um you know um uh it's it's like a
[1:10:59] pretty good place it's got some good uh
[1:11:02] good potential uh for wheat and barley
[1:11:04] and and uh you know joe's center he's
[1:11:06] like yeah he said you know what i think
[1:11:09] i'm gonna buy that piece of property boy
[1:11:11] it's like you know what he said that's
[1:11:12] that's good ground it's kind of like
[1:11:13] somebody comes and they tell you you
[1:11:15] want i got good news and bad news which
[1:11:17] one you want first so he's he tells but
[1:11:20] he tells joe um the good news first what
[1:11:23] is good good ground is
[1:11:25] water's close by it's got a good well on
[1:11:26] it and uh and so he's like yeah i'll buy
[1:11:29] it i buy it but then a boy is like um
[1:11:32] just one little thing there um
[1:11:35] one little catch uh
[1:11:37] you gotta take two widows and he's like
[1:11:38] huh
[1:11:39] um
[1:11:40] one little catcher's two widows what
[1:11:42] what did you say
[1:11:43] two widows come along with it he's like
[1:11:46] huh huh two widows huh
[1:11:49] i guess he had never seen ruth yet
[1:11:53] so he's like two widows oh brother
[1:11:56] and
[1:11:57] the and and what uh you gotta rate you
[1:12:00] know according to the law you gotta
[1:12:01] marry one of the widows what and you
[1:12:04] gotta raise up seed
[1:12:06] a son
[1:12:07] and guess what
[1:12:08] according to the law of uh heredity he's
[1:12:11] gonna fall there to the land and but you
[1:12:13] know but you can have it for you know 20
[1:12:15] 30 years at the most he's like wait a
[1:12:17] minute this ain't sound like too good of
[1:12:18] a deal to me i don't want this all right
[1:12:21] because ruth what is kind of a woman see
[1:12:24] and so he backs out of he takes the shoe
[1:12:26] off hands at the boat i said oh no and
[1:12:29] that was a symbol of possession in the
[1:12:32] hebrew culture
[1:12:33] and they knew that and so when he hands
[1:12:35] him that shoe he gives it to him and of
[1:12:38] course we know the rest of the story
[1:12:40] don't we
[1:12:41] and for what boaz did you know his name
[1:12:44] was inscribed on the temple
[1:12:46] on one of the pillars of the temple
[1:12:48] is that right on the first temple that
[1:12:50] solomon built amen
[1:12:52] and and what what's so striking is how
[1:12:55] that god brought in ruth who was a
[1:12:57] moabitess and you know boaz's mother was
[1:13:00] rahab
[1:13:01] so he didn't have no problem marrying
[1:13:02] him about us you know but the other
[1:13:04] guy's like oh she's not my kind of a
[1:13:05] woman i don't i don't need that
[1:13:08] but you know what
[1:13:10] that's just about
[1:13:11] how the devil is
[1:13:14] because he really don't want you he
[1:13:15] wants to destroy you but you ain't his
[1:13:17] kind of a woman
[1:13:19] let me tell you something tonight
[1:13:22] you don't ring his bell
[1:13:24] you know why because you don't listen to
[1:13:26] his vomit that he spews out
[1:13:30] you're the bride of the lord jesus
[1:13:32] christ
[1:13:33] if you don't hear nothing else in this
[1:13:34] message hear that tonight you are his
[1:13:37] bride tonight amen
[1:13:39] but ruth wasn't his kind of a woman
[1:13:42] well let me tell you something about the
[1:13:43] footsteps being possession see when
[1:13:46] moses met the burning bush god said this
[1:13:48] ain't yours this is mine and mine alone
[1:13:51] you take off your shoes moses
[1:13:53] when joshua went across to jordan take
[1:13:55] off his shoes joshua
[1:13:58] is that right who are you i'm the
[1:14:00] captain of the lord's host take off your
[1:14:02] shoes
[1:14:04] see that wasn't theirs
[1:14:06] only what see you got authority if
[1:14:08] you're under authority
[1:14:10] well god was trying to establish
[1:14:12] see
[1:14:13] we only have authority tonight because
[1:14:14] we're under authority if we step out
[1:14:16] from under that authority we have no
[1:14:17] authority
[1:14:18] is that right
[1:14:19] but let me tell you something i think
[1:14:20] about another one and and sometimes
[1:14:23] people get this all scrupled up and i
[1:14:25] was just talking to brother jason the
[1:14:26] other day about this in revelations 10
[1:14:28] when the angel comes down
[1:14:32] what does he do
[1:14:34] he sets one foot
[1:14:35] on the land
[1:14:37] and he says one foot on the sea the sea
[1:14:40] representing people
[1:14:41] why he's
[1:14:42] he stepped off the mercy seat he's now
[1:14:44] he's got the book see and he sets one
[1:14:46] foot on land in one seat and cries with
[1:14:49] a loud voice what he's coming down to
[1:14:51] possess he's claiming it this is all his
[1:14:53] see it's gotta be burnt over but all of
[1:14:55] it's his now all this a lot of folks say
[1:14:57] well that already happened and they get
[1:14:59] way off on the on the mercy's overkick
[1:15:02] some of them say it ain't happened yet i
[1:15:04] believe it's happening now as we're
[1:15:06] sitting here
[1:15:08] see as grace is going up judgments are
[1:15:11] coming down amen
[1:15:13] and that was the part that always kind
[1:15:14] of uh got me off because brother brown
[1:15:16] said at this time when this is see this
[1:15:18] is the difference when it's completed
[1:15:20] when he takes full possession
[1:15:23] but he said the shout the voice and the
[1:15:25] trump of god he does all three as he's
[1:15:27] descending
[1:15:28] see
[1:15:29] so what what we want to do is right now
[1:15:32] the reaper he sees putting in the sickle
[1:15:34] for the harvest see but even that
[1:15:36] morning when the reaper gets up and he
[1:15:38] drinks his coffee
[1:15:40] and he gets his sickle out and he goes
[1:15:41] over with a wet rock and gets it real
[1:15:43] good and sharp and he starts he goes out
[1:15:45] stretches oh it's a big old field i'm
[1:15:47] getting ready to go cut it even while
[1:15:49] the the reaper's on his way to the field
[1:15:51] they're still wheat getting ripe in the
[1:15:53] field
[1:15:54] at that time
[1:15:56] see he's coming
[1:15:57] right now
[1:15:58] he's almost here we've seen his
[1:16:00] appearing
[1:16:01] brother brown said these things that you
[1:16:03] see are his appearing don't get it mixed
[1:16:05] up with his coming
[1:16:06] when he breaks the eastern sky one
[1:16:08] morning
[1:16:09] and that trump of god sounds and the
[1:16:11] dead in christ rises see
[1:16:14] then we go to meet him in the air
[1:16:17] but he's coming he's he is appearing now
[1:16:20] amen
[1:16:21] do you believe it
[1:16:24] and now how do we get there
[1:16:26] so what i was going to say a little bit
[1:16:27] ago is what's the whole problem
[1:16:30] is we've got mechanics but where's the
[1:16:32] dynamics see
[1:16:34] i was so glad to hear about dynamics
[1:16:36] y'all laughing at my my bandana here
[1:16:40] it's all right how about i need a shop
[1:16:42] towel or a beach towel up here where i
[1:16:44] sweat sometimes
[1:16:46] but
[1:16:52] so
[1:16:53] we've got the mechanics but i i how many
[1:16:55] heard the testimony
[1:16:57] i mean i better wait on brother matt to
[1:16:59] give that testimony yeah you better how
[1:17:01] about all right so i'll wait on that but
[1:17:04] i tell you what god is doing exploits
[1:17:06] today
[1:17:06] he's doing exploits in our time amen
[1:17:10] so
[1:17:10] what we what we're looking for is the
[1:17:12] dynamics
[1:17:13] so each one of you right now just
[1:17:16] imagine
[1:17:17] a saturn v rocket or whatever that
[1:17:19] rocket is that elon must come up with so
[1:17:22] one of those rockets is sitting on the
[1:17:24] launch pad
[1:17:26] and right now it's got a a
[1:17:28] pre-designated
[1:17:30] coordinates put into that rocket
[1:17:32] it's got fuel in that rocket
[1:17:35] it's ready for takeoff
[1:17:38] but it lacks one thing
[1:17:41] fire
[1:17:42] see it takes fire
[1:17:45] to get under that to take it off and
[1:17:48] that's you and i we what we need tonight
[1:17:51] we need that fire of the holy ghost in
[1:17:53] our life see
[1:17:54] we need more of him living in us
[1:17:57] less of us
[1:17:59] more of him
[1:18:01] dig out
[1:18:02] brother brown said this i'm going to
[1:18:04] read this to you making the valley full
[1:18:06] of ditches
[1:18:07] now he said
[1:18:10] i think this is it
[1:18:14] is this all right with y'all
[1:18:19] well
[1:18:20] there we go yeah that's it
[1:18:23] now he said now i saw a vision i see the
[1:18:26] way out i know what to do and i tell you
[1:18:29] brother today the church hasn't got the
[1:18:31] vision or they'd have more prayer they'd
[1:18:33] be more spiritual than what they are
[1:18:36] unless there is a vision unless someone

[1:27:31] sanctify
[1:27:32] and make spotless abroad
[1:27:34] by his own precious blood
[1:27:37] and the brother jason was just telling
[1:27:38] me that brother branham said that we are
[1:27:40] part of that godhead why because we came
[1:27:43] out of christ right
[1:27:44] we was in that original we came out of
[1:27:46] him we're going right back to him he's
[1:27:48] going to pull us right up to his side
[1:27:50] we're going to sit on the throne with
[1:27:51] him he's going to hold everything you
[1:27:53] went through was it worth it oh it was
[1:27:55] worth it all the troubles i which i

[1:33:23] what he is
[1:33:26] in his mind

[1:33:33] think about his family and when he looks
[1:33:35] at me i want him to see completion i
[1:33:37] want him to see perfection i thought
[1:33:39] about brother branham there you know in
[1:33:41] shalom talking about you know the the
[1:33:44] composer i mean when it when he's
[1:33:46] writing a masterpiece there and
[1:33:47] masterpiece and and shalom in different
[1:33:49] places where when you're writing a
[1:33:52] masterpiece you're the composer it only
[1:33:54] matters what you think
[1:33:56] and the conductor has to do it like you
[1:33:59] want it the musicians have to play it
[1:34:02] like you want it and amen i i want to
[1:34:05] have the spirit of the composer tonight

[1:34:16] up some prayer requests but i love
[1:34:18] that god came with a purpose
[1:34:21] i hope you absorb that tonight as
[1:34:24] brother joe was just coming down he made
[1:34:26] that statement right at the end god
[1:34:28] came
[1:34:29] everything he has done
[1:34:31] has been with a purpose
[1:34:33] he came to accomplish something because
[1:34:35] otherwise then it just becomes well why
[1:34:38] am i here why am i at church and i i
[1:34:40] thought about
[1:34:42] you know
[1:34:44] david you know the bible says that when
[1:34:47] when that man i forget his name now in
[1:34:49] the scripture
[1:34:50] when he when the ark was unsteadied and
[1:34:54] the man just put his hand on it just
[1:34:56] casually
[1:34:57] and and the lord struck him dead and the
[1:35:00] bible talks about david was angry over
[1:35:02] that and david wasn't david you you know
[1:35:05] this is a man after god's own heart
[1:35:06] you're never going to find the david i
[1:35:09] read about in the bible angry at god
[1:35:12] i see that as self-loathing i see that
[1:35:14] david realized that this is a
[1:35:17] trickle-down economy this is from the
[1:35:20] top
[1:35:20] i didn't care enough about consulting
[1:35:23] the word
[1:35:25] i took the word too casually and and
[1:35:28] that trickled down to a man who thought
[1:35:31] nothing more than just putting his hand
[1:35:33] on on something that he was never
[1:35:35] supposed to lay a hand on
[1:35:37] and i think about that you know as
[1:35:39] brother joe was saying
[1:35:40] you know wish i'd uh went to wednesday
[1:35:42] nights which shadow went to more sundays
[1:35:44] wished i'd have prayed more wish i'd
[1:35:46] have had more of a life wish i had to
[1:35:48] listen to more tapes i i sit there
[1:35:50] reflecting on that i thought about all
[1:35:52] my years and the age i am now and the
[1:35:54] generations that i preached to
[1:35:57] we were just speaking uh brother kenneth
[1:35:59] and i speaking just the other day and i
[1:36:02] think i was counting up we were in our
[1:36:04] sixth i think fifth i think we're in our
[1:36:06] currently our sixth generation of senior
[1:36:08] youth and you know i've seen a lot
[1:36:12] and
[1:36:13] one of the things that will break my
[1:36:14] heart faster than anything
[1:36:17] is to see
[1:36:18] somebody as an adult and i started
[1:36:21] preaching to them when they were just a
[1:36:23] child maybe dedicated them then baptized
[1:36:25] them then preached to them and they went
[1:36:27] from a child to you know
[1:36:29] a young a young boy and then from there
[1:36:32] into a teenager from a teenager into a
[1:36:34] young man or a young woman and then from
[1:36:36] there into an adulthood and married life
[1:36:38] and then they're having children and
[1:36:40] then i'm dedicating those children and
[1:36:42] baptizing those children and looking
[1:36:44] back to see
[1:36:45] all that investment of time all that
[1:36:47] investment of word and not just me i'm
[1:36:50] just the lord's servant but all of god's
[1:36:52] investment
[1:36:53] and to see it just
[1:36:55] disregarded
[1:36:56] to say my
[1:36:58] you know i i've seen two i guess what
[1:37:01] what breaks my heart is i've seen too
[1:37:03] many times where i'm sitting with a a
[1:37:07] married couple
[1:37:08] they're in there
[1:37:10] approaching you know
[1:37:12] middle age
[1:37:13] you know somewhere around in there got
[1:37:15] kids got teenagers and got regrets
[1:37:19] now
[1:37:20] because they never did the thing
[1:37:22] that the ministry warned them about and
[1:37:24] warned them about and warned about and
[1:37:26] preached to them i'll tell you something
[1:37:27] friends don't disregard the word of god
[1:37:31] take it seriously god did this for a
[1:37:36] purpose the lord came into our day with
[1:37:38] this message
[1:37:40] on purpose
[1:37:42] god didn't just save you
[1:37:44] for purpose he saved you on purpose are

[1:40:52] i wrote this note down right at the

[1:40:55] his brother joe was reading that quote
[1:40:58] [Music]
[1:41:00] and you know
[1:41:02] whatever you do
[1:41:04] don't do nothing
[1:41:08] brother branham taught us that there's
[1:41:10] no way
[1:41:12] to come into the presence of god
[1:41:14] and leave the same person you came amen
[1:41:18] you will either

[1:41:28] way you either leave better or you leave
[1:41:31] worse
[1:41:32] and i think
[1:41:34] the most surefire way
[1:41:36] to leave worse is to come into the
[1:41:38] presence of god and just do nothing
[1:41:41] [Music]
[1:41:43] i want to invite you tonight to think
[1:41:45] about the word you heard god
