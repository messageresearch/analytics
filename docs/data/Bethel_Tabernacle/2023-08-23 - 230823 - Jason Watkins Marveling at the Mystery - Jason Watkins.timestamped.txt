[33:52] praise the Lord At Last marveling At the
[33:56] mystery
[33:57] been working
[33:59] well that's I don't know that I can make
[34:01] that claim I got the thought of this it
[34:03] all came out of the heavens a couple of
[34:05] weeks ago
[34:06] at least the beginning of it all day
[34:09] today has been the continuation of the
[34:12] outpouring so I wasn't
[34:14] um
[34:15] too sure that that's the way I would go
[34:17] but it just was a unending Fountain so I
[34:20] just went with it and glad I did I have
[34:23] really enjoyed studying this thought
[34:25] today so I've covered your undivided
[34:27] attention for just a little while I know
[34:29] it's Wednesday I won't keep too long but
[34:32] it's just a little bit of a diversion
[34:33] from my series
[34:35] amen
[34:37] that we've been working on on restoring
[34:39] Eden so uh rebuilding Eden so we're
[34:42] looking tonight at marveling at the
[34:44] mystery revelation 17. and verse 1.
[34:50] and there came one of the Seven Angels
[34:53] which had the seven vials and talked
[34:56] with me saying unto me
[34:59] come hither I will show unto thee the
[35:02] Judgment of the great that sitteth
[35:04] upon many Waters
[35:06] with whom the kings of the Earth have
[35:09] committed fornication and the
[35:11] inhabitants of the Earth have been made
[35:14] drunk with the wine of her fornication
[35:18] so he carried me away in the spirit Into
[35:21] the Wilderness
[35:23] and I saw a woman sit upon a Scarlet
[35:25] colored Beast
[35:27] full of names of blasphemy having seven
[35:30] heads and ten horns
[35:33] and the woman was a raid in purple and
[35:35] scarlet color and decked with gold and
[35:38] precious stones and Pearls having a
[35:41] golden cup in her hand full of
[35:43] Abominations
[35:44] and filthiness of her fornication
[35:49] and upon her forehead was a name written
[35:52] mystery Babylon the great the mother of
[35:56] harlots and the Abominations of the
[35:59] earth that's quite a title
[36:01] and I saw the woman drunken with the
[36:04] blood of the Saints
[36:06] and with the blood of the martyrs of
[36:07] Jesus
[36:09] and when I saw her
[36:11] I wondered with great admiration that's
[36:14] shocking
[36:16] having just seen what he had seen and
[36:19] having been told what he was told
[36:22] by the angel who had one of the seven
[36:25] vials this is I'm not teaching on it
[36:28] tonight but if I were working on a study
[36:31] in Revelation chapter 17 opens with the
[36:35] messenger of this age coming to John
[36:39] he's one of the messengers of the seven
[36:41] vials
[36:43] just just to jog your memory you
[36:46] remember that brother Branham back when
[36:48] we taught on the vows brother Branham
[36:50] taught on the vials people just don't
[36:52] realize that because he didn't call it
[36:54] that but he named a series and he said
[36:57] in here we're going to get to these
[36:58] vials and by the time he comes to the
[37:00] end of it he says now I hope you
[37:01] understand the vials better and I did I
[37:04] had a tremendous much once I knew that's
[37:06] what he was doing
[37:07] and remember that the seventh vial has
[37:11] already been partially opened brother
[37:13] Branham threw a rock up in the air
[37:16] voice of God said to him take a rock and
[37:18] throw it in the air and say thus saith
[37:21] the Lord judgment striking the west
[37:23] coast and brother Branham said now from
[37:25] that moment the judgments will just I
[37:28] forget his exact language the judgments
[37:30] will just keep rolling and it'll roll
[37:32] all the way into the tribulation listen
[37:34] friends the woes have already started
[37:36] the seventh vial has already released
[37:39] into the air no wonder you see the
[37:41] madness
[37:42] an insanity out there in the world
[37:44] because it was a plague on men's Mind
[37:47] released in the air so there's no way to
[37:49] get away from it if you breathe you get
[37:51] it
[37:51] a man mask won't help you no vaccination
[37:54] except this
[37:56] praise the Lord
[37:58] so this is clearly and I just want to
[38:01] say it intentionally
[38:04] distinctly
[38:06] you are reading in verse 1 that is
[38:10] William Branham
[38:14] unmistakably
[38:16] unquestioning there's no way to
[38:18] challenge that in the Bible it's clearly
[38:21] the angel to the seventh age that is
[38:24] absolute in the Bible
[38:27] and now he says here in verse 6 and I
[38:30] saw the woman drunken with the blood of
[38:33] the Saints and with the blood of the
[38:36] martyrs of Jesus and when I saw her I
[38:40] wondered with great admiration
[38:43] so
[38:45] John represents the bride
[38:48] so I would say this is something we need
[38:51] to take a warning from
[38:53] you understand
[38:54] I want to point out to you that neither
[38:57] his seed Gene nor his Upper Room
[39:01] experience
[39:02] stopped him from admiring this religious
[39:05] system
[39:06] the only way he got his head on straight
[39:09] was the angel corrected him
[39:13] all right more on that in a minute
[39:15] and the angel verse 7 said unto him
[39:18] wherefore didst thou Marvel
[39:22] fair question I will tell thee The
[39:24] Mystery of the woman and of the Beast
[39:27] that carreth her which hath the seven
[39:30] heads and ten horns that was the
[39:32] ministry of William Branham that's what
[39:34] he did he explained who the mystery of
[39:36] this the mystery the Beast that she rode
[39:39] was a power
[39:40] and who the who the Beast was who the
[39:43] false prophet was who the Antichrist is
[39:45] they probed at it
[39:48] they all a lot of them probed at it a
[39:51] lot of reformers probed at it and and
[39:53] got some of it right and even John wrote
[39:56] that her you know death follows him we
[40:00] know that
[40:01] we know that that's that much we know
[40:03] but it took the prophet of the last day
[40:05] to identify exactly precisely
[40:10] authoritatively who it was
[40:13] so that you could authoritatively avoid
[40:16] it
[40:18] amen
[40:20] all right let's pray
[40:23] Master we thank you
[40:25] for the wisdom that you have given us in
[40:27] the word we thank you for the insight
[40:30] Lord we're not caught unawares we're not
[40:33] caught we shouldn't be anyway caught off
[40:36] guard by these things we we're not
[40:39] troubled Lord it is troubling to see the
[40:42] craziness in the world very troubling
[40:45] but we're not troubled we are as Paul
[40:47] said cast down but not forsaken we we do
[40:52] go through these things and we're right
[40:54] there with the rest Lord when when when
[40:56] when Israel was captive in Babylon
[40:59] everything any Calamity that the nation
[41:03] of Babylon suffered Israel had to suffer
[41:05] along with it but they were still your
[41:07] redeemed people
[41:09] so we you get you brought them out of
[41:11] there Lord and you're going to take us
[41:12] out of here and I'm glad for that so I
[41:15] thank you tonight and I ask that you
[41:17] give us real uh understanding in the
[41:21] word of God tonight give us courage Lord
[41:23] to look at it
[41:26] to face it
[41:27] it took me today a great deal of Courage
[41:31] Lord as I went through to study it
[41:34] father so I'm I'm praying now for all of
[41:37] us we're remember we're but dust and I
[41:40] ask for your mercy on our lives in Jesus
[41:43] name amen God bless you friends you can
[41:46] be seated
[41:56] praise the Lord
[41:58] um
[41:59] let's go ahead and put my oh thank you
[42:01] sir that's my title slide
[42:04] and I want to by the help of the Lord
[42:09] take this subtitle
[42:12] the seducing spirit
[42:14] of the Modern Age
[42:17] don't you
[42:20] think less than that it is a seducing
[42:24] seductive
[42:26] sultry tempting
[42:28] Spirit of this age
[42:31] and it seeks to draw even God's family
[42:36] and lure her away from the clear-cut uh
[42:44] lines of demarcation between
[42:48] the real Holy Ghost and an impersonation
[42:51] of it
[42:52] the real
[42:54] real Christianity
[42:56] and an impersonation of Christianity
[43:00] that's what the Holy Ghost is given for
[43:03] he's not mistaken over his word he's not
[43:08] mistaken over his bride aren't you glad
[43:12] he's not mistaken over his Messengers
[43:15] he's never had to repent
[43:18] for anything
[43:20] he's never had a bad idea amen Christ
[43:24] has never had a bad idea
[43:26] he's never sent forth a word and had to
[43:31] had to send out a recall
[43:34] foreign
[43:35] good to see you I thought I recognize
[43:38] that voice
[43:39] he's never had to send out a recall
[43:43] [Applause]
[43:45] back in uh there's something that's in
[43:48] that that could be a health hazard and
[43:50] maybe catch you on fire or cause you to
[43:53] crash
[43:55] there's no recalls needed the word of
[43:58] God Has Come to Us perfect
[44:01] every
[44:02] every member of his family that has ever
[44:06] been in the earth came into the Earth as
[44:09] a member of his family lived in the
[44:11] Earth as a member of his family Departed
[44:14] the world as a member of his family they
[44:17] had all kinds of ups and downs we have
[44:19] all kinds of ups and downs
[44:21] all right but but I'm but I'm my
[44:24] confidence is in whom I have believed
[44:29] I don't put my confidence in myself I
[44:33] put my confidence in him who called me
[44:36] who chose me who ordained me
[44:41] you tonight have the grand privilege to
[44:45] know that your Redeemer Lives
[44:48] that you can know that for a certainty
[44:52] and it's not a head knowledge sister
[44:55] Debbie and I were listening to a take
[44:58] today that I didn't remember hearing if
[45:00] if I ever have it's been a long time it
[45:02] was fortunately I didn't know if it
[45:04] would the audit would be clear it's from
[45:05] 1955 a very good tape called where
[45:09] Pentecost
[45:11] went wrong or where Pentecost made its
[45:14] mistake something to that effect
[45:16] on November 11 1955
[45:20] and brother Branham is
[45:22] is he's got about at that point he's got
[45:25] about 13 months
[45:27] to turn Pentecost around
[45:30] or she's going to cross a line and
[45:34] America with her
[45:36] after 1956 that's it and going into 1957
[45:40] a prophet says in 56 this is her last
[45:44] opportunity and here he is at the end of
[45:47] 1955 and he's preaching his heart out
[45:52] he's pleading with Pentecost in the most
[45:55] humble
[45:57] way softly speaking to them to say you
[46:02] know you know you know where we've made
[46:03] our mistake it should be obvious to us
[46:07] where our mistake is and he just went
[46:09] into the word and I'm going to tell you
[46:12] it's an amazing I I just paused it I
[46:15] said to my wife I said it is astonishing
[46:18] to me that anyone could hear the sincere
[46:22] heart of this man pleading for the cause
[46:25] of Christ humbly and with such feeling
[46:29] of love and compassion for the audience
[46:32] and those people who would hear it and
[46:35] and how anyone could turn that aside and
[46:39] how anyone could think anyway in any way
[46:41] less than that this was surely one of
[46:44] the most lovely humble Ministers of the
[46:47] Gospel that the Lord had ever sent to
[46:49] the Earth
[46:52] and yet
[46:54] he couldn't turn it around
[46:56] he couldn't turn it around he tried to
[46:59] turn it around but he couldn't turn it
[47:01] around it was not going to be turned
[47:04] around you say no then then a greater
[47:08] Prophet needed to come hey Jesus came
[47:11] himself to try to turn Israel around and
[47:15] he couldn't do it
[47:17] see
[47:18] and and so so we realized that God is
[47:21] still in control of it all but here we
[47:25] find
[47:26] John
[47:28] in the representation of the Bride As
[47:31] Brethren taught us in the in the Book of
[47:33] Revelation
[47:34] he marveled he found himself
[47:38] greatly admiring
[47:40] this religious system of the end time
[47:44] don't forget
[47:46] John was caught up to the in the to the
[47:48] Lord's day which means he was caught up
[47:50] to our day that's the Lord's Day the day
[47:52] of the Lord is the day of judgment it's
[47:54] a finality it's the it's the completion
[47:56] of all the ages John was caught forward
[47:58] and even God said now even God said I'm
[48:02] gonna even when he showed him the ages
[48:04] and he takes him up and he says now I'm
[48:06] going to show you what must be hereafter
[48:09] and so literally he gave John a front
[48:13] row seat and he gave him a prophet tour
[48:16] guide
[48:18] a prophet from the future
[48:21] who John tried repeatedly to worship but
[48:24] who a hundred percent of the time
[48:27] refused worship and redirected it back
[48:31] to God
[48:32] as any true Prophet would
[48:36] so John representing the bride he's he's
[48:39] admiring this religious system of the
[48:42] end time
[48:44] Cinder a prophet from the future a
[48:48] carbon-based human prophet
[48:52] told him that he should not Marvel or
[48:56] wonder or admire her
[48:59] that the blood of the martyrs was under
[49:02] her skirts that she was a beast
[49:05] a very terrible Beast who who who Wars
[49:11] against Christ at every turn and the
[49:15] prophet is saying to him don't be
[49:17] impressed
[49:18] and I I give you the pro I give you the
[49:21] the prophet's words to the bride to John
[49:23] of the last day don't be impressed with
[49:26] this world's order
[49:29] it's a sinful order don't be young
[49:33] people don't be impressed
[49:36] with the sinful order of this world
[49:39] don't be drawn in
[49:42] because it's a beast system
[49:45] now in no way are we limiting this
[49:49] tonight to the Church of Rome
[49:52] it's not limited to the Catholic Church
[49:54] you know man-made religion
[49:58] man-made religion is only a front
[50:02] for this satanic influence that is upon
[50:07] the world today
[50:09] he uses listen
[50:11] he uses beautiful religion
[50:16] to deceive the people
[50:19] that's the scriptures
[50:21] he uses Beauty he uses religion he uses
[50:24] beautiful religion to deceive the people
[50:29] that's the secret that the messenger
[50:33] uncovered and boy don't you know the
[50:36] devil didn't like being outed like that
[50:39] but prophets have a a nasty habit of
[50:43] outing the devil in every age and
[50:47] they're always coming to identify the
[50:49] true and living God and to clearly show
[50:52] who the Antichrist is and this Prophet
[50:55] was no different that it takes the whole
[50:59] world into deception as the Book of
[51:03] Revelation shows us they shall all
[51:05] worship Him whose names were not written
[51:08] in the Book of Life of the Lamb slain
[51:11] before the foundation of the world the
[51:13] whole world the Bible says that shall
[51:16] worship Him whose names were not written
[51:19] in the Book of Life of the Lamb the very
[51:23] fact that it takes the whole world into
[51:25] its deception is evidence
[51:30] that nobody thinks the messenger was
[51:33] right
[51:37] they believe in Mass he was mistaken
[51:42] [Music]
[51:44] in order to get John the bride at the
[51:47] end time not to do that
[51:51] not to fall for that the angel revealed
[51:56] The Mystery of the Beast he come into
[52:00] this age with simple Kentucky grammar
[52:03] and rather than use some Greek and
[52:06] Hebrew mashup to explain to you who
[52:09] Satan was brother Branham in his
[52:11] Kentucky wake just says he's a slicker
[52:17] he's a slicker
[52:20] had somebody call me that one time
[52:23] I almost punched them off their feet
[52:29] I went in and probably put on raggedy
[52:32] clothes just to not have that appearance
[52:36] but it's not an appearance it's an
[52:38] attitude it's a it's a spirit it's a
[52:40] it's something that transmits it's
[52:42] something it's an aura
[52:43] see it's a deceptive uh spirit and
[52:48] brother Branham called him a Slicker he
[52:50] said Satan is a slicker said he he's not
[52:53] some ghoulish monstrous with horns and a
[52:57] pitchfork and a red tail he said he's a
[53:00] Slicker and he he impersonates
[53:03] Christianity and I I just wonder tonight
[53:06] are you on the lookout for that
[53:10] because we're talking about a deception
[53:13] on a scale like the world has never seen
[53:17] and a deception so close to the real
[53:20] that it would deceive even the elected
[53:23] if that were possible
[53:25] so we're not talking about something you
[53:28] know that looks like the devil we're
[53:31] talking about something that looks kind
[53:34] of like Christianity it feels kind of
[53:38] like Christianity it appeals to your
[53:41] emotions and appeals to your mind and
[53:44] appeals to your senses and can almost
[53:46] make you think that you know we're all
[53:49] the same we're not
[53:53] we're not
[53:55] God's family has never been the same as
[54:01] anyone else in the earth in any age of
[54:06] History
[54:07] she's separate
[54:09] she's called out
[54:11] she's chosen she's peculiar she's weird
[54:15] and nutty
[54:18] by the world's standards wear that with
[54:22] pride I'll say you today be a nut with
[54:24] pride say well I'm screwed to the right
[54:27] bull I know that
[54:29] see
[54:31] so I'm not talking about now you know
[54:34] when I say are you are you on the
[54:36] lookout
[54:37] for this I'm not talking about living in
[54:39] fear
[54:41] not talking about walking around in fear
[54:45] conspiracy
[54:47] anxiety
[54:50] you know it's it's now I want to say
[54:52] this
[54:53] it's not it's not about burying your
[54:56] head in the sand and denying legitimate
[55:00] satanic conspiracy
[55:03] because that's part of the ruse
[55:06] see
[55:07] you're talking about a conspiracy
[55:09] brother Branham calls it a trinity
[55:13] of power
[55:15] it's the ultimate conspiracy and and he
[55:18] says it's a trinity of political power
[55:21] religious power and Demon power
[55:27] we don't fear him because greater is he
[55:30] that is in us than he that is in the
[55:33] world you say Amen to that
[55:36] so so but but but I will say to you
[55:40] you know tracking it and worrying about
[55:43] the conspiracies that go on today
[55:46] friends that's a recipe for
[55:48] uncontrollable anxiety
[55:52] uncontrollable
[55:53] you'll never get past it take all the
[55:55] meds you want see all the doctors you
[55:57] want it's a neurotic age and the doctors
[55:59] are giving doctors meds
[56:02] brother Brown said that in the 60s
[56:04] psychiatrists are treating psychiatrists
[56:08] see these things are all well known and
[56:12] and movie stars and sports stars and
[56:15] music stars and they all have to have
[56:18] therapists and psychiatrists and drugs
[56:20] and sometimes they go over the edge and
[56:22] those doctors end up killing them
[56:25] it's a mad world and we're I'm glad to
[56:27] not be a part of it
[56:31] I'm glad that God is in control of all
[56:34] things and all men so we are not to live
[56:37] in fear he's not just the god of Good
[56:39] Men he's the God of all men
[56:43] but but but but are you
[56:46] are you cognizant of the fact
[56:49] that this deception that was prophesied
[56:53] to appear at the end of time which how
[56:56] many believe were there
[56:58] this deception that was to appear
[57:01] it this deception not North Korea or
[57:05] China or Russia
[57:07] this deception is the greatest
[57:10] existential threat human kind has ever
[57:14] faced
[57:16] this threat is so
[57:20] so big
[57:22] it looms so large that it's going to
[57:26] take
[57:27] Humanity to a complete Extinction event
[57:32] no World War has ever done that no
[57:34] Tyrant no dictator no world power no
[57:36] nuclear bombs no nothing has ever done
[57:39] that
[57:40] this is the greatest threat the world
[57:43] has ever faced the effect it can have
[57:46] on your life
[57:48] uh
[57:51] is it can can be Indescribable if you
[57:54] let it get a toehold in your life see
[57:58] the deception and and let me let me say
[58:00] it like this as it relates to the Bride
[58:04] of Jesus Christ because I've got some
[58:06] quotes you'll be familiar with about how
[58:08] that this bride's predestinated to not
[58:10] fall
[58:11] she can't be deceived because she's
[58:12] elected as Jesus said it would deceive
[58:14] the very like if that were possible
[58:15] we'll look at that in a minute
[58:17] but
[58:19] but we know what this deception is going
[58:21] to do to the world I'm really not
[58:23] preaching to the world
[58:24] I'm actually preaching to believers
[58:28] and when it comes to the Believers the
[58:30] deception that's the one that you've got
[58:33] to worry about I already know you're not
[58:36] gonna join a denomination
[58:43] for real of course I won't I already
[58:45] know you won't have anything to do with
[58:47] organized religion I'm not here to tell
[58:49] you what you already know I'm here to
[58:52] tell you that as a Believer the
[58:53] deception to watch out for is to
[58:56] mentally minimize sin and carnality of
[59:01] the Beast system controlling the world
[59:06] and the effect that that can have
[59:09] for you to mentally minimize in your
[59:13] mind you minimalize you minimize
[59:17] carnality
[59:19] you minimize the sin or it doesn't
[59:21] matter oh it matters
[59:24] the effect it can have on your lives or
[59:27] should I say more desperately on the
[59:30] lives of your loved ones
[59:33] that you're supposed to protect and Lead
[59:37] who came into the world with a little
[59:40] innocent sinful nature
[59:43] that came from you by the way
[59:46] just saying
[59:49] I got that from you
[59:52] and you're gonna give them a double
[59:55] whammy
[59:56] you bring them into the world
[59:59] through a way that birthed him with
[1:00:01] never giving their permission they're
[1:00:03] born into a world in sin and then you
[1:00:05] don't even have the decency to keep them
[1:00:09] away from carnality and sin
[1:00:13] see
[1:00:15] more often than not
[1:00:18] it happens when you minimize the
[1:00:22] significance
[1:00:23] and the authority
[1:00:25] of the messenger
[1:00:27] sent to warn you
[1:00:31] talking to believers
[1:00:35] not here to preach to the world tonight
[1:00:38] preaching to believers I'm going to say
[1:00:41] it again more often than not
[1:00:45] it happens when what happens when people
[1:00:48] mentally minimize sin and carnality in
[1:00:52] their homes and their lives and their
[1:00:53] activities
[1:00:54] they do it they do it in their lives
[1:00:56] they do it around their loved ones who
[1:00:58] are looking to them for example more
[1:01:00] often than not it happens when you
[1:01:02] minimize the significance and the
[1:01:05] authority of the messenger sent to warn
[1:01:09] you what do you suppose would have
[1:01:11] happened had John done that
[1:01:17] John is
[1:01:18] minister google-eyed
[1:01:20] he's Smitten by this modern
[1:01:25] impersonation of Christianity
[1:01:28] did I read it did you read it with me
[1:01:31] he says it that's his words I greatly
[1:01:34] admired and the angel
[1:01:36] are you kidding
[1:01:39] I I I I want I will tell you
[1:01:44] what she really is
[1:01:46] the blood of your brothers and
[1:01:48] sisters are just under her skirt she's
[1:01:50] drinking their blood
[1:01:53] this is an impersonation of Christianity
[1:01:58] nothing to do with that John you have
[1:01:59] nothing to do with that bride
[1:02:02] we are separate unto God
[1:02:05] how many want to live in the in the
[1:02:08] regions where God lives you want to live
[1:02:09] up there in those spheres
[1:02:12] yet that's on you God's willing to bring
[1:02:14] you up there but you've got to be
[1:02:16] willing to lay aside you can't minimize
[1:02:19] these things you got to get rid of them
[1:02:21] and get them out of your life
[1:02:24] brother said that's for whoever wants to
[1:02:26] live up there in those in those spheres
[1:02:27] with God
[1:02:31] brother Branham in our first quote says
[1:02:34] thirsting for life
[1:02:40] is that scream darkened somehow it
[1:02:43] doesn't look very bright but um if you
[1:02:46] can fool with it without interrupting me
[1:02:48] fine if not with weight collfter service
[1:02:51] thirsting for life that's a grand title
[1:02:53] isn't it

[1:02:57] my Birthright in Jesus Christ
[1:03:00] for all the television and popularity

[1:04:08] these nasty ungodly things I'd rather
[1:04:12] have favor with Christ than to be the
[1:04:15] president of the world

[1:04:39] Shadows of death I would advise you
[1:04:42] at this hour to prepare to meet God that
[1:04:45] will have to meet you at that hour
[1:04:48] you'll either meet him as a masterpiece
[1:04:50] that he has worked on or a floating
[1:04:53] piece of Driftwood to go to your final
[1:04:56] destination
[1:04:58] so don't you use listen don't here's a
[1:05:03] prophet don't you use this life just to
[1:05:07] drift around and Float around and get a
[1:05:10] better job and address better and to get
[1:05:14] a new television or a better car life
[1:05:17] means more than that
[1:05:22] Hallelujah
[1:05:24] life means more than that
[1:05:29] sometimes
[1:05:30] Believers can get caught in that in that
[1:05:34] same thing this this fast-paced
[1:05:38] highly advanced
[1:05:40] civilization with goodness
[1:05:44] everything is at our fingertips
[1:05:47] everything
[1:05:49] you know I I was I was talking to my
[1:05:51] wife about you know in in agrarian days
[1:05:54] before the Industrial Revolution when
[1:05:56] you know we were Agricultural and we
[1:05:59] raised farms and you might have a 5 10
[1:06:04] 12 member family on a farm like Jacob
[1:06:07] back in the Old Testament and had all of
[1:06:09] his sons around and daughters and
[1:06:11] everybody had a job and everybody worked
[1:06:13] and and when the family had a need you
[1:06:16] know what everybody went into the field
[1:06:18] to work
[1:06:20] that's how you did it a family worked
[1:06:23] together to put food on the table and
[1:06:26] and today you can't hardly get teenagers
[1:06:29] to put their phones down
[1:06:32] to wash a dirty dish
[1:06:36] this is what the world has become it's
[1:06:39] Madness
[1:06:41] it's insanity
[1:06:48] like any unhealthy food we eat
[1:06:52] we gain unhealthy results do you believe
[1:06:55] that
[1:06:56] remember that that we eat and live I
[1:07:00] mean listen historically speaking and
[1:07:03] I'm not going to here to preach a
[1:07:04] history lesson but historically speaking
[1:07:07] we and I even have stuff I could read
[1:07:10] you for reference but we we literally
[1:07:13] it's proven that we in this High
[1:07:15] Advanced civilization with everything at
[1:07:17] our fingertips we eat and we live with
[1:07:20] greater substance than Kings and
[1:07:23] monarchs ever dreamed of living
[1:07:28] you have you have more substance and and
[1:07:32] nice things and access to things even
[1:07:36] even just spices in your cabinet
[1:07:39] that they used to have to fight Wars
[1:07:42] over
[1:07:44] but Wars over spices
[1:07:47] things that you can just go to the
[1:07:48] grocery store right now and fill a
[1:07:50] pantry with
[1:07:52] see
[1:07:53] the the curse at the end time is to be
[1:07:57] weaker and wiser from the Tree of
[1:07:59] knowledge
[1:08:01] that's the warning that we're under in
[1:08:04] this age
[1:08:05] you know and and if we're not careful if
[1:08:08] we're not careful Believers you still
[1:08:10] believe her
[1:08:12] if we're not careful Believers we we
[1:08:15] like John we can become drunk with the
[1:08:21] wine of her fornication like other
[1:08:24] churches have
[1:08:26] and you might be a son or daughter of
[1:08:29] God doing it
[1:08:31] you have to be careful
[1:08:34] we be because we can become drunk with
[1:08:37] the wine of her fornication
[1:08:40] Jesus said for there shall arise false
[1:08:43] Christ and false prophets
[1:08:46] and shall show great signs and wonders
[1:08:51] in so much that if it were possible they
[1:08:54] shall deceive the very elect
[1:08:58] right
[1:08:59] brother Branham says in Christ is the
[1:09:01] mystery
[1:09:03] but the even the last day is not going
[1:09:06] to do it because she's predestinated
[1:09:09] to not to do it
[1:09:12] she'll be a token to the world
[1:09:17] God will you'll be like uh a trophy
[1:09:23] that God will be able to say when the
[1:09:26] world tries to
[1:09:27] say God is unfair God can just point to
[1:09:30] his bride say well how is she doing it
[1:09:33] because I'm not doing it for her I'm I'm
[1:09:36] living in her but she's the one
[1:09:37] overcoming
[1:09:39] see
[1:09:41] I'm not I'm not pushing her through a
[1:09:43] pipe I'm not pouring her into a mold and
[1:09:46] pouring her pulling around saying see my
[1:09:48] Overcomer pride no no she's doing that
[1:09:51] herself
[1:09:53] I sent a prophet and told her that
[1:09:55] there's some things I won't do for her
[1:09:57] she the bride will make herself ready
[1:10:00] and you will be an overcomer
[1:10:05] he gives you the word he gives you his
[1:10:07] Spirit he gives you church he gives you
[1:10:10] prayer gives you his Bible he gives you
[1:10:11] taste he gives you friends listen listen
[1:10:15] so so if you have found yourself
[1:10:18] mingling around
[1:10:20] with all of the false religion
[1:10:24] and you say well I'm not mingling around
[1:10:26] with that well where are you at tonight
[1:10:28] in service are you even here
[1:10:33] or oh I'm sorry did some some event some
[1:10:37] career some job keep you out of the
[1:10:40] house of God poor thing
[1:10:43] a career and a job God gives you and
[1:10:45] that's your gratitude for him
[1:10:47] and God gives you everything you have
[1:10:50] including the air in your lungs
[1:10:53] and you and he gives you children and
[1:10:56] you can't even bring him to the house of
[1:10:57] God
[1:10:59] my goodness
[1:11:01] when's the last time you set your
[1:11:02] children down and opened the Bible or
[1:11:04] played a tape
[1:11:09] see I'm I'm speaking to not necessarily
[1:11:11] anyone in here tonight so you understand
[1:11:13] this this goes around the world
[1:11:16] so
[1:11:18] but it but if the shoe fits wear it
[1:11:21] and if you don't like the shoe grow and
[1:11:23] it won't fit
[1:11:29] you see friends I get what brother
[1:11:31] Branham is saying here I understand that
[1:11:33] but can I can I point something out to
[1:11:35] you in the natural world of physical
[1:11:37] laws
[1:11:38] if I drink out of the same wine bottle
[1:11:40] as an unbeliever I'll get just as
[1:11:42] intoxicated
[1:11:45] that quote won't stop that
[1:11:49] that Bible verse
[1:11:52] right there won't prevent that
[1:11:55] John had the Holy Ghost
[1:11:58] right
[1:11:59] John John here is caught up into the
[1:12:02] Lord's day and has even got a prophet
[1:12:03] walking with him instructing him and he
[1:12:05] still falls into that trap
[1:12:08] if I drink out of the same if you run
[1:12:11] with dogs you get fleas if you drink out
[1:12:14] of the same wine bottle as the world is
[1:12:16] drinking out of I'm not saying you're
[1:12:18] not a believer I'm saying you're foolish
[1:12:23] it's the truth
[1:12:25] see and it shows up
[1:12:29] oh mine Lord help me to keep going
[1:12:34] so the Holy Ghost doesn't keep me from
[1:12:37] getting drunk on it the Holy Ghost keeps
[1:12:40] me from drinking it amen
[1:12:47] it doesn't prevent me from getting drunk
[1:12:48] if I drink it it just prevents me from
[1:12:50] drinking it
[1:12:52] see you go away and you wonder
[1:12:55] oh my how many times I've I've heard
[1:12:59] this in people whining and complaining
[1:13:01] over because the Lord had to take a
[1:13:04] paddle to him and they wonder why
[1:13:06] goodness or what's worse and what's more
[1:13:09] heartbreaking is they have to watch
[1:13:11] their children get a paddling
[1:13:15] for because the Lord had to teach them
[1:13:17] something the parents should have taught
[1:13:18] them
[1:13:20] and didn't
[1:13:22] and then the Lord has to teach it to him
[1:13:25] you're talking about pain in the heart
[1:13:27] of a parent that's that's pain
[1:13:30] when you see the Lord they have to
[1:13:32] suffer because the Lord taught him
[1:13:33] something you never taught them
[1:13:35] see
[1:13:36] and if you ever told it to him it
[1:13:38] immediately got erased in their mind
[1:13:40] because they saw you didn't live what
[1:13:42] you were saying
[1:13:45] I mean listen friends you know it it I
[1:13:48] know it can look like judgment I get
[1:13:50] that sometimes it can look like judgment
[1:13:52] but can I say to you tonight it's it's
[1:13:54] actually the love of God it's actually
[1:13:56] the love of God because you're
[1:13:59] predestinated to not fall
[1:14:03] because you're predestinated to not fall
[1:14:06] because that's true about you it's not
[1:14:09] judgment it's the love of God and I just
[1:14:11] say Lord pour that love on me
[1:14:17] I mean even brother Branham is being
[1:14:19] told at one time he he can't get his
[1:14:21] line tangled up in these kinds of days
[1:14:23] now of course that's because of a misuse
[1:14:26] of his ministry but I mean it's it's a
[1:14:28] blanket concern in life for all of us
[1:14:32] don't get your line tangled up in these
[1:14:36] kinds of times you're coming to the
[1:14:38] consummation of the ages you're the
[1:14:40] generation upon whom the ends of the
[1:14:42] world have come
[1:14:47] brother Branham talks about how that the
[1:14:51] Saints there and the in the
[1:14:55] early centuries that when they went in
[1:14:58] there to at the Council of nicaea trying
[1:15:01] to stand for the word of God trying to
[1:15:03] take a stand
[1:15:06] say well that was a noble thing brother
[1:15:08] Branham said they had no business
[1:15:12] going there
[1:15:14] that you they weren't going to turn them
[1:15:16] around polycarp learned that the hard
[1:15:18] way
[1:15:19] see maybe it's one of the reasons why a
[1:15:22] prophet couldn't choose him though many
[1:15:24] theologians chose him over ireneus but
[1:15:26] brother Brown says no irenius was the
[1:15:27] messenger because polycarp leaned just a
[1:15:29] little bit too much to organize religion
[1:15:31] he just had that little bit of coloring
[1:15:34] and irenius was militant against it
[1:15:38] and so so we find that brother Adam said
[1:15:41] they had no business being there and and
[1:15:43] that's why that's why brother Branham
[1:15:45] goes into the scripture when it came to
[1:15:47] the Feast of Bel peor
[1:15:50] and that was when Moab holds a big a big
[1:15:53] Moab holds a big church service
[1:15:57] and they're they're trying to they're
[1:15:59] trying to get Balaam to curse Israel
[1:16:01] that doesn't work that's never going to
[1:16:03] work and so Balaam says well I told you
[1:16:06] I couldn't do it in the beginning and
[1:16:07] and if you offered me more money a
[1:16:10] goodness if you offered me all the money
[1:16:11] in the world I can't curse what God has
[1:16:14] blessed
[1:16:15] but I can tell you how to trick them
[1:16:19] hold a big Feast call it a big religious
[1:16:22] day and invite him to church
[1:16:25] and Israel fell for that not all of them
[1:16:29] but some of them some of them were even
[1:16:31] princes
[1:16:33] and you know what happened to them they
[1:16:35] went in there and they got sucked in
[1:16:39] and God looked upon and they were and
[1:16:42] and right away they started questioning
[1:16:43] the authority of the messenger now how
[1:16:47] do you know that well because one of
[1:16:48] them happened to come back with a a
[1:16:52] moabite hooker
[1:16:54] walked right past Aaron and Moses like
[1:16:58] you don't have no authority over me and
[1:17:01] took her into the tent and the and
[1:17:04] Phineas grabbed up a javelin and winning
[1:17:06] after him and finished them
[1:17:08] and God said that Phineas I'm so proud
[1:17:11] of you your line will be priests to me
[1:17:14] forever
[1:17:15] but you can see that that that kind of a
[1:17:19] moving in those circles caused the
[1:17:22] message to be reduced in their mind and
[1:17:26] the authority of the messenger who told
[1:17:28] them don't go don't have nothing to do
[1:17:30] with that
[1:17:33] how many know their Bibles
[1:17:36] see so I I I know that we should not be
[1:17:40] Tangled with the world young people
[1:17:42] don't be Tangled Up don't get tangled up
[1:17:45] in social media and and all it's going
[1:17:47] to do is feed you this woke agenda that
[1:17:50] should be the last thing on your mind is
[1:17:52] this woke left left woke agenda that
[1:17:56] denies God and denies the authority of
[1:17:58] the Bible and denies everything that we
[1:18:01] hold dear
[1:18:03] and and inverts families and destroys
[1:18:06] the nuclear family and puts a woman out
[1:18:07] of her place and a man out of his place
[1:18:09] and young people out of their place no
[1:18:11] wonder children in the last day will
[1:18:14] rise up to torment their parents that's
[1:18:16] prophecy
[1:18:19] husbands and wives should not be Tangled
[1:18:22] Up in this layout of sin economy chasing
[1:18:25] the wrong things for gain
[1:18:29] come on friends I'm an old-fashioned
[1:18:31] believer but I believe the word of God
[1:18:34] is true and I believe it tells Families
[1:18:36] how to live how to operate how husbands
[1:18:39] and wives should be how children should
[1:18:41] be in the home how there should be
[1:18:42] respect and everybody should be
[1:18:44] contributors
[1:18:47] I believe in the old-fashioned power of
[1:18:49] God in a church I believe that families
[1:18:51] ought to be spiritual they ought to come
[1:18:53] in here praying you ought to come in
[1:18:55] here rejoicing you ought to be able to
[1:18:57] welcome the Holy Spirit
[1:18:59] then we can see impossible uh cancers
[1:19:03] destroyed then we can see homes repaired
[1:19:06] and marriage is repaired and young
[1:19:08] people filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:19:11] I say we sell out to the word of God
[1:19:14] whatever what about it Bethel Tabernacle
[1:19:16] I say we sell out to the word of God
[1:19:19] Hallelujah
[1:19:25] when we look at this these two
[1:19:27] scriptures
[1:19:28] I don't know if I could
[1:19:31] put two
[1:19:33] more opposite
[1:19:35] Polar Opposites than these two
[1:19:38] scriptures
[1:19:40] one is the judgment
[1:19:42] that you read about in The Book of
[1:19:43] Revelation only here it's a record a
[1:19:45] part of it's recorded in Matthew 25 that
[1:19:47] Revelation doesn't doesn't
[1:19:49] make you privy to
[1:19:51] Jesus covers it
[1:19:54] this now is that false Church
[1:19:58] coming to say
[1:20:01] we have all kinds of works that we've
[1:20:03] done
[1:20:04] we were a beautiful church we did all
[1:20:06] kinds of a command all kinds of
[1:20:07] accomplishments and we had programs and
[1:20:10] and family and you know what
[1:20:13] Jesus doesn't deny that they did those
[1:20:16] things
[1:20:17] he just simply says they don't count
[1:20:19] because you they were iniquitous works
[1:20:23] and you knew all the time that your
[1:20:25] heart wasn't right
[1:20:28] you knew all along that your heart
[1:20:30] wasn't right
[1:20:32] and therefore he answered and said
[1:20:34] verily I say unto you I know you not
[1:20:37] now can I say this to you if he didn't
[1:20:40] know them
[1:20:42] they didn't know him
[1:20:47] what does God were talking about
[1:20:49] if he didn't know them then they didn't
[1:20:52] know him either
[1:20:54] I'm not talking about he was he was not
[1:20:56] aware of their presence in the earth he
[1:20:58] gave them life ain't talking about their
[1:21:00] their their carbon-based body he knew
[1:21:02] they were there he gave him an
[1:21:03] opportunity and dealt with them in life
[1:21:05] it's not what we're talking about
[1:21:07] what we're talking about is that they
[1:21:10] never ever in all of their religiosity
[1:21:13] and all of their beautiful religiousness
[1:21:18] they never had a relationship with
[1:21:22] Christ
[1:21:23] at any level
[1:21:27] now the foolish virgin did they were
[1:21:29] actually saved
[1:21:31] and they didn't even know how they got
[1:21:33] saved
[1:21:34] they didn't even remember doing those
[1:21:36] things for him
[1:21:37] I mean I'm glad I'm sure they were glad
[1:21:39] they did it
[1:21:40] Lord I'm I mean I'm glad I did it but I
[1:21:43] kind of don't really well just just I
[1:21:45] really don't remember doing it
[1:21:47] but but you you see that what the Lord
[1:21:49] was pointing at in the story that Jesus
[1:21:52] is telling is that what determines this
[1:21:55] is why God looks at the heart what
[1:21:57] determines was their heart's response to
[1:21:59] the word at whatever level God revealed
[1:22:02] it they caught it and believed it and
[1:22:04] ran with it
[1:22:06] and it was genuine and it was real
[1:22:09] and the Bible calls them Sanctified ones
[1:22:12] the Bible calls them saints in rev in
[1:22:15] the Book of Revelation
[1:22:16] in Matthew 25 Jesus the king calls them
[1:22:20] righteous
[1:22:21] you see so these are Sanctified living
[1:22:25] people
[1:22:26] who lived Sanctified lives that's your
[1:22:30] foolish virgin
[1:22:32] not the impersonation of Christianity
[1:22:36] not saying people can't cross from one
[1:22:38] category to another many of us came out
[1:22:40] of those systems and came into the
[1:22:42] revealed word not saying they can't be
[1:22:44] move on and get out of that come to
[1:22:46] their senses before it's too late that's
[1:22:48] why I'm preaching that's why we're on
[1:22:49] the internet
[1:22:50] trying to reach them and tell them
[1:22:51] you're you're deceived you're you think
[1:22:54] you're okay you're not okay
[1:22:56] but my message tonight is to Believers
[1:22:59] you know you might not be okay either if
[1:23:02] you're drinking out of the same goblet
[1:23:04] as the religious world as the
[1:23:07] impersonators of Christianity if you're
[1:23:10] drinking out of that you're getting
[1:23:11] drunk with them
[1:23:14] me
[1:23:17] so he says I knew you not I I know you
[1:23:21] not now look at the exact opposite
[1:23:23] Ephesians 1 6 to the praise of the glory
[1:23:26] of his grace wherein he hath made us
[1:23:29] accepted in the Beloved I'd say there's
[1:23:31] a pretty start one of me don't know him
[1:23:33] at all and the other ones have been
[1:23:35] accepted in the Beloved
[1:23:37] he goes on Paul here in Colossians
[1:23:40] giving thanks unto the father catch this
[1:23:42] now
[1:23:43] giving thanks unto the Father which hath
[1:23:47] made us meet to be partakers of the
[1:23:49] inheritance of the Saints in say it with
[1:23:53] me light
[1:23:55] so how do you how do you find right
[1:23:57] standing with God you have to be a Child
[1:24:01] of the Light
[1:24:03] so when the light comes you have to
[1:24:06] accept it
[1:24:08] see
[1:24:09] it's so powerful that even the foolish
[1:24:13] virgin who aren't ordained to see all
[1:24:15] the light are saved just by agreeing
[1:24:18] with what life they do see
[1:24:20] that's how powerful it is
[1:24:24] who hath delivered us catch it from the
[1:24:28] power of Darkness
[1:24:30] and hath translated us into the kingdom
[1:24:34] into the kingdom of his dear son verse
[1:24:37] 14 in whom in whom
[1:24:40] we are in Christ
[1:24:43] we have Redemption who has Redemption
[1:24:46] those who are in Christ
[1:24:48] how did I get in I followed the light
[1:24:52] I receive the light if we walk in the
[1:24:55] light as he is in the light the blood of
[1:24:58] Jesus Christ cleanses us from all sin
[1:25:01] see
[1:25:03] so so the prophet
[1:25:05] sent with the spirit of Elijah now I I
[1:25:08] want to I want to I want to turn a
[1:25:10] corner
[1:25:12] all right
[1:25:13] I'm gonna turn the corner you good
[1:25:20] so
[1:25:22] a prophet
[1:25:24] who came to us
[1:25:26] with the spirit of Elijah
[1:25:30] say well you really are emphasizing that
[1:25:32] aren't you I need to
[1:25:34] because where we're headed
[1:25:36] okay
[1:25:38] so I want it in your mind
[1:25:41] the prophet sent with the spirit of
[1:25:44] Elijah
[1:25:45] called out
[1:25:47] entertainers
[1:25:50] he called them out
[1:25:52] by name
[1:25:55] most prominently
[1:25:57] he repeatedly called out Elvis Presley
[1:26:00] Pat Boone and Ernie Ford
[1:26:04] and he called those names publicly Elvis
[1:26:08] Presley
[1:26:09] Pat Boone's and Ernie Ford
[1:26:13] now he declared that Elvis Presley
[1:26:16] became a modern day Judas Iscariot
[1:26:21] because he started out in a Pentecostal
[1:26:22] Church
[1:26:25] he had a god-given gift
[1:26:30] God doesn't take those things back even
[1:26:32] if you misuse them
[1:26:35] he was given a gift that should have
[1:26:37] been into the in the control of the Holy
[1:26:39] Ghost for the benefit of God's family
[1:26:44] but brother Branham says that
[1:26:47] he became a modern day Judas Iscariot
[1:26:51] because he sold his god-given gift
[1:26:56] for Satan's use
[1:26:58] in exchange for a fleet of Cadillacs
[1:27:03] for a fleet of Cadillacs
[1:27:06] Fortune
[1:27:08] Fame
[1:27:09] and Glory
[1:27:12] in doing so
[1:27:14] he doomed himself
[1:27:17] and he doomed millions of teenagers and
[1:27:22] adults alike to the Lake of Fire
[1:27:28] by now it's likely tens of millions
[1:27:31] that's directly by extension it's
[1:27:34] probably many times that
[1:27:37] by extension of his influence it's very
[1:27:40] likely uh hundreds of millions of
[1:27:44] teenagers and adults have been doomed to
[1:27:48] the Flames of the Lake of Fire because
[1:27:52] Elvis Presley with a gift from God sold
[1:27:56] it for the devil's usage
[1:28:01] it doesn't it's not strange to me that
[1:28:05] that this would be the
[1:28:07] final prophetic identification Judas
[1:28:11] Iscariot
[1:28:12] that doesn't surprise me that a prophet
[1:28:14] would
[1:28:15] that his final words about Elvis Presley
[1:28:18] was that he was a modern day Judas is
[1:28:20] scared that doesn't shock me because I
[1:28:22] mean Elvis was the king of rock and roll
[1:28:26] but I I find it most interesting that he
[1:28:29] would call out by name Pat Boone and
[1:28:32] Ernie Ford
[1:28:34] Folk
[1:28:35] country and gospel singers
[1:28:40] and many times gospel singers
[1:28:44] good old boys
[1:28:47] soft-spoken large-hearted
[1:28:50] could make you really feel good
[1:28:52] listening to their even their Gospel
[1:28:54] tunes
[1:28:56] and they even had
[1:28:58] confessions of conversions and they went
[1:29:00] to church
[1:29:03] but here's an Elijah Prophet saying
[1:29:06] Elvis Presley and he's putting them in
[1:29:07] in one category Pat Boone
[1:29:11] Ernie Ford
[1:29:15] that he grouped them together
[1:29:17] under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost
[1:29:20] numerous times in the Pulpit I'm
[1:29:24] certainly listen friends I I'm certainly
[1:29:27] not Elijah
[1:29:30] and I'm I'm not even his assistant
[1:29:32] Elisha but but neither are we facing
[1:29:36] those Cub Scout level days
[1:29:41] so all things being equal I think I can
[1:29:44] go forward as a servant of the Lord
[1:29:46] [Music]
[1:29:48] having the same Holy Ghost and by the
[1:29:50] way with a Divine call
[1:29:54] you better believe that you better find
[1:29:55] another church
[1:29:58] see
[1:30:00] as a pastor as a believer
[1:30:03] as a preacher of this message I can say
[1:30:06] With all sincerity that that we might
[1:30:10] need to revisit this deceptive way of
[1:30:13] the devil
[1:30:15] in the way that he operated in Elvis
[1:30:18] Presley Pat Boone and Tennessee Ernie
[1:30:21] Ford
[1:30:24] as he tries and goodness gracious
[1:30:28] seems determined to try to do it again
[1:30:31] right here at the finish line
[1:30:38] but he answered I'm bringing you back to
[1:30:40] this
[1:30:42] but he answered and said
[1:30:44] verily I say unto you
[1:30:46] I know you not
[1:31:03] Hillsong
[1:31:05] does not
[1:31:06] know him
[1:31:09] as the bride knows him
[1:31:13] this is the impersonation of
[1:31:16] Christianity
[1:31:19] this young woman
[1:31:23] according to the Bible
[1:31:25] she is wasting her time to even pray
[1:31:30] a woman who cuts her hair
[1:31:33] that is a sign of rebellion to God and
[1:31:37] she can pray all day long God will not
[1:31:40] hear her prayers that means she doesn't
[1:31:43] even have access to having an audience
[1:31:45] with him
[1:31:46] she can't even if people say feels like
[1:31:49] my prayers aren't getting more higher
[1:31:50] than the ceiling hers truly aren't
[1:31:56] seeing this singer cannot even receive
[1:31:59] an audience
[1:32:01] with God to hear her prayers
[1:32:04] is she savable I hope so
[1:32:07] could she come to the knowledge of the
[1:32:09] truth God granted
[1:32:11] have mercy she looks like a very nice
[1:32:14] person
[1:32:16] see now where I want to make this clear
[1:32:20] we're not talking about a gift and I'm
[1:32:22] not even talking about their songs
[1:32:24] but just remember can I just say this
[1:32:26] for the sake of our worship leaders just
[1:32:28] to give you some instruction
[1:32:30] that sometimes you'll hear our worship
[1:32:33] leader sing these people's songs you
[1:32:35] know why that is because brother Branham
[1:32:37] said all inspiration comes from God a l
[1:32:40] l
[1:32:41] only thing that happens is it falls on
[1:32:44] an unre unregenerate vessel and it gets
[1:32:46] twisted that inspiration came from God
[1:32:48] we own that that's for me that was sent
[1:32:51] for me I have a right to go reclaim that
[1:32:54] song and redo it under a proper
[1:32:56] anointing it belongs to me
[1:33:00] so if they take the inspiration that
[1:33:02] came from my father and they wrote a
[1:33:05] song and jazzed it up and rocked it up
[1:33:07] so that you can't even you shouldn't
[1:33:08] even be playing it
[1:33:11] then we have the right and I I have the
[1:33:14] right with Holy Ghost filled uh worship
[1:33:16] leaders to say brother I have confidence
[1:33:18] in you you want to sing that song redo
[1:33:20] it you know how I want it to sound redo
[1:33:22] it because you're a holy ghost filled
[1:33:24] man and it comes out like it was
[1:33:25] supposed to come
[1:33:29] amen
[1:33:31] all right I just I just want to take up
[1:33:33] for my worship leaders for a second
[1:33:36] all right so
[1:33:38] but in this but but I'm just saying I'm
[1:33:41] not judging her heart I'm just saying
[1:33:42] right now she can't even get a prayer
[1:33:44] through
[1:33:46] but the deception is
[1:33:48] the deception is so strong because of
[1:33:51] the Charisma and the song and the music
[1:33:52] and the the melody and the beat and
[1:33:55] she's pretty and she sings like an angel
[1:33:57] and it literally like John it just
[1:34:01] causes John to go
[1:34:02] I greatly admired her
[1:34:05] until the prophet slaps him
[1:34:09] what are you thinking
[1:34:15] you good
[1:34:17] I hate to show this picture it's so
[1:34:19] vulgar
[1:34:26] don't get mad at me teenagers
[1:34:28] Lauren Daigle doesn't know him as the
[1:34:31] bride knows him
[1:34:37] I I don't even want to leave that up
[1:34:41] sincerity
[1:34:43] I have no doubt of that
[1:34:45] I'm not questioning her her motives
[1:34:48] could could it brother Jason goodness
[1:34:51] gracious you sound so judgmental I don't
[1:34:53] know why
[1:34:54] I I acknowledge sincerity
[1:34:57] I don't deny that at all I'm not saying
[1:35:00] she's a fake
[1:35:02] I I you say well could it could it be
[1:35:04] that maybe she's like brother Branham
[1:35:06] said maybe misinterpreted Theology and
[1:35:09] that's why she's like that sure
[1:35:11] sure that could be that could absolutely
[1:35:14] be I'm not here to say she couldn't come
[1:35:16] to an altar and get the real Holy Ghost
[1:35:19] and become a real lady
[1:35:22] before Christ
[1:35:24] brother Branham listen brother Branham I
[1:35:26] didn't put the quote up but I could have
[1:35:27] brother Branham talks about Jackie
[1:35:29] Kennedy and says that maybe if she had
[1:35:32] he didn't want to be judgmental of her
[1:35:34] he said because maybe she never heard
[1:35:35] one of my messages
[1:35:37] maybe if she would have heard one of my
[1:35:39] messages it would have been different
[1:35:41] with her and Jack
[1:35:43] said I certainly disagree with his
[1:35:45] politics but maybe if he'd have heard
[1:35:47] one of my messages things could have
[1:35:48] been different so I I'm not even talking
[1:35:51] about her songwriting ability for
[1:35:54] goodness sake don't turn me off because
[1:35:56] maybe I made you mad
[1:35:58] you don't know how many times I can
[1:36:00] preach an hour and a half sermon and
[1:36:02] somebody got mad over 27 seconds
[1:36:05] and if it comes at the front of the
[1:36:07] sermon they don't hear the rest of the
[1:36:09] sermon are we believers
[1:36:14] I'm not talking about her songwriting
[1:36:17] ability that's a gift of God she'll be
[1:36:20] responsible uh to to the one who gave it
[1:36:23] to her for who she allowed to anoint it
[1:36:27] she doesn't own the gift the gift is in
[1:36:30] her like the gift is in me to preach
[1:36:32] that's a piece of Machinery put in me at
[1:36:34] Birth I can't control that it just
[1:36:36] clicks on and starts working
[1:36:39] see I'm not the gift I I thank you
[1:36:42] praise the Lord
[1:36:44] praise the Lord
[1:36:47] I hope so
[1:36:50] I don't mind a rose now and then
[1:36:57] she will be responsible I will be
[1:37:00] responsible every minister in here every
[1:37:02] musician every worship leader will be
[1:37:06] response every every worshiper will be
[1:37:09] responsible for who you let anoint the
[1:37:12] gifts that lay within you
[1:37:15] just like her just like you I'm not
[1:37:18] saying she can't get saved
[1:37:21] I'm not saying it's not a you know I I
[1:37:24] mean I mean look I mean when I talk
[1:37:26] about the gift of God and her being
[1:37:28] responsible that's true for every
[1:37:30] born-again believer every child of God
[1:37:32] who has a gift from God I'm not saying
[1:37:35] she can't get saved I'm not preaching
[1:37:38] about God saving people I'm preaching
[1:37:41] about people under the deception of the
[1:37:44] end time making people believe they are
[1:37:47] saved when they're not right I'm gonna
[1:37:51] say it again I'm not preaching about
[1:37:53] being saved I'm preaching about the
[1:37:55] deception that tells them they're safe
[1:37:56] when they're not saved
[1:38:00] I'm preaching about Believers minimizing
[1:38:03] this kind of deception and blowing it
[1:38:07] off and will maybe even leave this
[1:38:10] service tonight and go right back with
[1:38:12] no effect no matter what the preacher
[1:38:14] says
[1:38:19] I'm not preaching uh uh like what you
[1:38:22] might think I am
[1:38:26] I don't want to see Believers minimize
[1:38:29] the deception
[1:38:32] say what do you mean by that okay
[1:38:35] let's just call let's just put it on put
[1:38:37] it put it right on it
[1:38:39] you know
[1:38:40] what does it mean to minimize you know
[1:38:44] this deception to minimize everything
[1:38:46] when I see people trying to copy it
[1:38:51] when I see people coming anywhere near
[1:38:54] that who claim to be believers
[1:38:58] that you're under a delusion by Satan
[1:39:02] amen that's not a Christian
[1:39:05] that's not godly that's not holy come on
[1:39:09] dear I mean do you feel that exposing
[1:39:12] naked sexuality is of the Holy Ghost be
[1:39:16] honest come on friends come on
[1:39:19] come on be honest young people be honest
[1:39:24] that's not holiness
[1:39:27] that's vulgarity
[1:39:29] I'm embarrassed to show it in the house
[1:39:31] of God
[1:39:35] and then to see believers
[1:39:37] kind of dressing kinda like that
[1:39:40] and having that loosey-goosey carnal
[1:39:43] lifestyle
[1:39:44] and you dress one way in church and then
[1:39:47] you dress a completely different way on
[1:39:49] Facebook
[1:39:51] you go to meetings and raise your hands
[1:39:53] and cry real tears and I grant you the
[1:39:55] real and then you go on Instagram and
[1:39:58] you're so vulgar I have to move the page
[1:40:00] quickly
[1:40:02] and you're supposed to be a believer
[1:40:04] you're not a Believer you're a hypocrite
[1:40:07] and you need to repent
[1:40:10] you need to ask God to have mercy on you
[1:40:12] you need to let the Holy Ghost come in
[1:40:15] and give you a refilling
[1:40:18] I'm not suggesting you haven't had
[1:40:19] experiences with the Lord you probably
[1:40:20] had lots of them you need a new one
[1:40:28] one side of me feels righteous
[1:40:30] indignation at this seductive trap that
[1:40:32] this is the deceptive allurement that
[1:40:35] brings upon the Bears upon the mind of
[1:40:38] our young sisters in the mind of our
[1:40:40] young brothers and even and and even
[1:40:42] more sadly as adults who wallow in it
[1:40:47] and I I I get my heart broken because I
[1:40:50] have to look at a picture and go like
[1:40:52] father like son
[1:40:54] like mother like daughter
[1:40:58] yeah husband over here was too weak and
[1:41:00] here he is the same it's just a it's the
[1:41:03] same Spirit living in a different body
[1:41:05] listen friends I'm trying to do one
[1:41:07] thing I'm trying to get you home
[1:41:09] I'm trying to get you in a Rapture I'm
[1:41:12] trying to get the Holy Ghost to move
[1:41:13] freely in your lives without without the
[1:41:16] Holy Spirit blushing
[1:41:18] when he comes into your presence
[1:41:21] did you know he could do that
[1:41:24] then there's the
[1:41:27] shock and all can I start preaching now
[1:41:33] then there's the
[1:41:35] the shock and all
[1:41:38] when I see even parents
[1:41:41] God help me not to break down
[1:41:50] I love children
[1:41:52] I love mine
[1:41:54] I love yours
[1:41:56] they're precious
[1:42:00] and right in the middle I see parents
[1:42:03] right in the middle of guiding Souls
[1:42:08] who are under their care
[1:42:10] parents who have been called into one of
[1:42:15] the most solemn and difficult duties
[1:42:19] that one could ever face in life
[1:42:24] raising the Lord's heritage
[1:42:29] raising them
[1:42:32] not according to your whims
[1:42:34] certainly not according to laodicea
[1:42:38] but raising God's Heritage in the
[1:42:41] admonition of God
[1:42:44] oh in the admonition of the Lord but yet
[1:42:48] shirking the duty
[1:42:50] that they have before God to mold these
[1:42:53] little innocent sinful nature lives in
[1:42:57] the direction of the word shirk that
[1:43:00] responsibility completely
[1:43:02] a responsibility
[1:43:05] that you have Mom and Dad
[1:43:08] a responsibility to help the Holy Ghost
[1:43:10] have a good chance to deal with them
[1:43:14] when they grow
[1:43:17] when I think about their little innocent
[1:43:20] lives they don't stay that way they grow
[1:43:22] up and then they start having problems
[1:43:26] none of us are perfect I don't think I
[1:43:29] think that I certainly wasn't perfect
[1:43:31] there's no one Perfect Adam and Eve had
[1:43:33] the most perfect parent you could ever
[1:43:35] want God they lived in a perfect place
[1:43:37] Garden of Eden they still fell I get
[1:43:39] that that can happen the devil's Wily
[1:43:43] but there's no pain like seeing your
[1:43:46] child suffer on something they can't get
[1:43:48] free of because you know you didn't hold
[1:43:50] the standard like you should have
[1:43:56] little children start life with no
[1:43:59] understanding at all of all of this if
[1:44:01] parents don't instruct them
[1:44:02] they start out they don't know nothing
[1:44:04] about it
[1:44:05] they're as innocent as can be they're a
[1:44:07] blank slate
[1:44:10] I mean what does it take to start with a
[1:44:13] blank slate
[1:44:14] and by the time you get 14 15 16 years
[1:44:18] down the road you've got a complete
[1:44:20] Anarchy and Rebellion how did you get
[1:44:22] how did you go from a blank slate to
[1:44:24] that
[1:44:26] and that took some Titanic failures
[1:44:29] see
[1:44:31] and they start life with no
[1:44:33] understanding and and and and they never
[1:44:36] they they they were they never were
[1:44:40] informed that Satan recorded their birth
[1:44:44] they never were informed that he opened
[1:44:46] a file on them the day they were born
[1:44:48] he's been plotting their destruction
[1:44:50] ever since they have no concept of that
[1:44:55] when that happens
[1:44:58] my heart goes from indignation to a
[1:45:00] terrible sadness
[1:45:04] and then I start thinking about
[1:45:07] what can I do to help
[1:45:10] What Can I Do Lord and I I know there I
[1:45:13] know they're not my children so I plead
[1:45:16] with the parents
[1:45:18] and I pray and I preach and I plead with
[1:45:21] them and it goes in one ear and out the
[1:45:24] other and nothing changes and years
[1:45:26] passed by and decades pass by in that
[1:45:29] little innocent Blank Slate grows up and
[1:45:31] now they're off headed into the world
[1:45:33] and and they've got their eye on the
[1:45:35] prize of oh you know let's be the king
[1:45:37] of the world let's whatever laodicea has
[1:45:39] because they never were taught that the
[1:45:42] world's burning down and not not to
[1:45:44] layer Treasures up here we're getting
[1:45:46] out of here
[1:45:52] and if I'm successful at that
[1:45:57] you know then I
[1:45:59] I A lot of times have terrible trouble
[1:46:02] pleading with parents to have spiritual
[1:46:05] homes
[1:46:06] to raise them to know God to teach them
[1:46:08] the ways of the Lord
[1:46:10] you know my motive
[1:46:13] can I say to you my motive and my
[1:46:16] objective in stepping on your toes
[1:46:20] and ruffling your feathers
[1:46:22] is whether you believe me or not my
[1:46:26] motive is not against you I'm trying to
[1:46:30] keep your children from appearing at the
[1:46:34] Judgment bar at all
[1:46:36] I don't want to see them in trial at all
[1:46:39] I want to see them on the throne
[1:46:45] listen oh goodness let me get back to my
[1:46:49] previous thought I gotta close it's

[1:46:52] keep you long got 10 more minutes
[1:46:55] I want to Circle back and just

[1:47:02] I feel so passionate about it
[1:47:05] so if I've hurt your feelings didn't
[1:47:06] love me anyway because it wasn't my
[1:47:09] intention to hurt your feelings
[1:47:12] you know we we put up these two young
[1:47:14] women
[1:47:17] sewed their picture
[1:47:20] and
[1:47:22] you know I I'm not saying those women
[1:47:24] couldn't become true Christians I want
[1:47:26] that on the record
[1:47:28] Jesus died for them as much as he did
[1:47:31] for anyone
[1:47:32] listen God so loved the God so loved
[1:47:35] them both that he gave his only begotten
[1:47:38] son to save them
[1:47:41] just as much as he did for anyone I
[1:47:45] don't doubt their sincerity at all I'm
[1:47:48] not the judge of someone's heart only
[1:47:50] God knows that I'm not sent here for
[1:47:55] that reason not sent here to judge their
[1:47:58] heart I'm sent here to shine a light
[1:48:02] so could I say to you tonight as we wind
[1:48:05] down
[1:48:06] if you if you if you happen to meet
[1:48:10] either of them
[1:48:12] and you get the chance uh please
[1:48:17] in great love and great kindness
[1:48:20] please tell them that they're short of
[1:48:22] the mark
[1:48:24] if you go to their concerts and you just
[1:48:26] happen to get a backstage pass or you
[1:48:28] get to get an autograph can you please
[1:48:30] just in love and kindness tell them
[1:48:34] I'm shocked that you'd be at their
[1:48:36] concert but if you are
[1:48:38] laughs
[1:48:39] I just I'm sorry the Lord backed me up
[1:48:42] on that one I had to turn around on that
[1:48:49] please tell them that
[1:48:51] they have a ways to go
[1:48:53] to be accepted in the Beloved
[1:48:58] to be accepted in the Beloved they have
[1:49:01] a ways to go and I just say now
[1:49:04] can I say
[1:49:08] please make sure you're qualified to say
[1:49:10] it
[1:49:14] don't don't let the the voice of your
[1:49:17] life be different from the voice of your
[1:49:18] words because then all you'll do is
[1:49:20] confuse them even more
[1:49:22] they've already had charlatan preachers
[1:49:24] who wouldn't tell them the truth who
[1:49:26] wouldn't live an example in front of
[1:49:27] them so if you're gonna if you're gonna
[1:49:29] tell them that they're short of the mark
[1:49:30] that they're not going to get to the
[1:49:32] Beloved that they got a ways to go
[1:49:34] please be qualified
[1:49:42] I can
[1:49:43] say with lots of study and prayer on
[1:49:46] this sermon
[1:49:48] connecting myself to the mind of God
[1:49:50] that the heartbreaking story
[1:49:55] these people
[1:49:57] tried to get into the kingdom
[1:50:00] and it was just an impersonation of
[1:50:02] Christianity
[1:50:03] it's so sad
[1:50:06] you see I I I as I said to you earlier
[1:50:09] if he doesn't know them then they never
[1:50:12] knew him if he never knew them they
[1:50:14] never knew him and and and and and I
[1:50:17] realized that that they don't know him
[1:50:19] and and no matter what it looks like in
[1:50:22] their videos
[1:50:25] no matter what it looks like
[1:50:29] they don't know him they've never met
[1:50:31] him
[1:50:33] it doesn't matter that they cry real
[1:50:35] tears and raise real hands and have real
[1:50:40] sincerity Cain had all of that
[1:50:48] that's that's an impersonation of
[1:50:52] Christianity
[1:50:55] the Pharisees did the exact same thing
[1:50:58] listen it might shock you but sincerity
[1:51:01] alongside of iniquity is possible
[1:51:06] sincerity alongside of iniquity is
[1:51:08] possible
[1:51:09] they're proving that nature itself
[1:51:11] taught them that they were wrong but
[1:51:13] they wanted a religion according to how
[1:51:15] they wanted it to be
[1:51:18] and the reason that the carnality won't
[1:51:21] go out of their lives is because they
[1:51:23] have re they have diminished the
[1:51:25] authority of the Prophet that was sent
[1:51:28] to John to tell him don't admire her
[1:51:33] don't stay away from her it's an
[1:51:36] impersonation and when you have
[1:51:37] minimalized the the prophet that came to
[1:51:41] John right here this Prophet from the
[1:51:43] future when you minimalize his authority
[1:51:46] no wonder the carnality won't leave your
[1:51:49] life
[1:51:50] no wonder I still see what I see on
[1:51:53] social media
[1:51:56] on on men and women who claim to be
[1:51:59] message believers
[1:52:02] see
[1:52:04] so because they wanted a gospel how they
[1:52:08] wanted it as I've said to you before if
[1:52:11] you go for very long and you don't get a
[1:52:13] new birth
[1:52:14] you know there's 33 000 different
[1:52:17] versions of the gospel and if you don't
[1:52:20] if you linger and dilly dally and stay
[1:52:23] in the valley of you know decision too
[1:52:25] long and get spiritual Amnesia and you
[1:52:28] sit in mess you might sit at a message
[1:52:29] church for two or three decades and
[1:52:31] never even been born again because you
[1:52:33] think you're all right you're not
[1:52:35] because I can see you're not because you
[1:52:36] can live like that
[1:52:38] see and and and and so so so when we
[1:52:42] when we come to that listen friends
[1:52:44] there's only there's only one way to do
[1:52:47] it you've got to come to God sincerely
[1:52:50] and in deep honesty and because what
[1:52:53] will happen is that you'll finally hunt
[1:52:56] around
[1:52:58] until you find a version of The Gospel
[1:53:00] that you wish was true
[1:53:02] and there's plenty of examples out there
[1:53:05] to give you that and tell you you're a
[1:53:06] Christian or you're a Believer even a
[1:53:08] believer the message and and none of
[1:53:10] it's true it's not accurate
[1:53:12] that's just not true
[1:53:17] not that they can never know him but if
[1:53:19] they are to know him
[1:53:21] listen not that these young ladies can
[1:53:24] never know him
[1:53:26] but if they are to know him God uses his
[1:53:29] family to win other people
[1:53:33] so how what what chance do they have how
[1:53:37] are you going to go give them a message
[1:53:39] if you if you live similar to him and
[1:53:41] you look kind of like them
[1:53:44] see I'm not talking about their music
[1:53:45] not talking about their song not talking
[1:53:47] about their gifted they're gifted people
[1:53:48] not some other songwriter on top of
[1:53:50] other songs I'm not talking about their
[1:53:52] motives not talking about their
[1:53:53] objective not questioning their
[1:53:55] sincerity I'm not judging their heart I
[1:53:57] have no way to do that
[1:53:59] but they need to hear
[1:54:01] you got further to go if you want to
[1:54:04] stand in the Beloved
[1:54:10] so tonight you know if you are
[1:54:13] imitating them
[1:54:18] if you're imitating them
[1:54:21] how are you going to show them him
[1:54:26] I'm not trying to insult you
[1:54:29] I'm not trying to anger you I'm not
[1:54:32] trying to irritate you
[1:54:34] I'm trying to wake you up
[1:54:36] to the greater need of God's presence in
[1:54:40] your life
[1:54:43] I close with this
[1:54:45] it comes back if not I'll read it
[1:54:49] try it again
[1:54:53] okay I'll just read it I can't get it
[1:54:55] back it's all good
[1:54:57] it's the last two
[1:55:00] slides on the PowerPoint
[1:55:03] here we go
[1:55:05] the last two
[1:55:08] one up
[1:55:11] right there right there
[1:55:14] let me say something to you notice a
[1:55:16] title
[1:55:17] if I read the title out loud
[1:55:20] you believe in that
[1:55:23] come musicians while I read this
[1:55:26] let me say
[1:55:28] something to you brother and sister
[1:55:33] in first John the second chapter and the
[1:55:37] 15th verse we can read it if you wish to
[1:55:40] the Bible says
[1:55:42] that if we love the world
[1:55:46] or the things of the world
[1:55:49] it's because the love of God is not even
[1:55:54] in US
[1:55:56] now the word
[1:55:58] there is not Earth it's a Greek word is
[1:56:02] Cosmos which means the world's order
[1:56:05] see so if we love Fashions of the Earth
[1:56:10] the world if we love the trend of the
[1:56:13] day
[1:56:14] if we think this is a wonderful time oh
[1:56:19] we have all these things if you think
[1:56:22] that it's because your thinking is wrong
[1:56:28] it's because your thinking is wrong
[1:56:35] do I it's it is perverted
[1:56:38] by the devil
[1:56:40] can you absorb that
[1:56:42] your thinking is wrong
[1:56:45] if you find
[1:56:47] the allurement of the world
[1:56:50] operating in your life
[1:56:55] then then there's a pro your your love
[1:56:57] of God tank is way down low on you're
[1:57:00] running on fumes
[1:57:03] bow your heads with me I'm going to read
[1:57:05] this quote to you why your heads are
[1:57:07] bound
[1:57:07] [Music]
[1:57:10] your thinking is wrong
[1:57:13] I'm gonna back up keep your heads bound
[1:57:15] listen
[1:57:17] carefully
[1:57:19] here's a prophet here's that profit from
[1:57:22] the future that came to John and rebuked
[1:57:25] him for admiring the world
[1:57:29] John was a Believer just like you he was
[1:57:31] a seed Gene just like you but he got
[1:57:33] caught in it
[1:57:35] let me say something to you here's that
[1:57:37] same Prophet that was speaking to John
[1:57:39] brother and sister
[1:57:40] first John the second chapter the 15th
[1:57:43] verse we can read it if you wish to the
[1:57:44] Bible says if we love the world or the
[1:57:47] things of the world it's because the
[1:57:49] love of God is not even in US
[1:57:52] now the word is Cosmos which means the
[1:57:56] world order so if we love Fashions of
[1:57:59] the Earth the world if we love the trend
[1:58:02] of the day if we think this is all a
[1:58:04] wonderful time oh we have all these
[1:58:06] things if you think that
[1:58:08] it's because your thinking is wrong it's
[1:58:12] been perverted by the devil
[1:58:15] for if you love The World's order and
[1:58:18] the things of this present world it's
[1:58:20] because the love of God's not even in
[1:58:23] you remember that oh god look what we're
[1:58:27] looking into
[1:58:32] I'm going to pray for you
[1:58:34] you pray for me
[1:58:37] this might not be the sermon you
[1:58:39] expected on a Wednesday night
[1:58:41] you might not have thought I was going
[1:58:43] to go in this way by the title
[1:58:45] marveling at the mystery
[1:58:49] but if you find yourself marveling at
[1:58:51] the mystery that a prophet has already
[1:58:52] interpreted and unlocked it
[1:58:55] it's still a mystery to you if you're
[1:58:56] marveling at it once once the prophet
[1:58:59] told John what it was he stopped
[1:59:01] marveling
[1:59:02] once he informed John by a revelation
[1:59:04] John quit quit chasing that
[1:59:08] so rather than now keep your heads valid
[1:59:12] but listen real careful I'm gonna give
[1:59:14] you a life-changing instruction
[1:59:18] rather than spending all your time
[1:59:21] asking God to change you can I put a can
[1:59:24] I put a little line in your prayer just
[1:59:26] ahead of that
[1:59:28] can you start your prayer by saying Lord
[1:59:30] give me more confidence in the messenger
[1:59:34] you sent me
[1:59:36] give me the same amount of confidence
[1:59:38] that John the Divine had when your
[1:59:43] Prophet came to him and said don't
[1:59:47] admire her
[1:59:49] don't Marvel at her don't be captivated
[1:59:54] by her that's an impersonation of
[1:59:57] Christianity she's against Christ
[2:00:01] she only looks like beautiful religion
[2:00:05] but a prophet that came to John who
[2:00:08] represented the bride has come to you
[2:00:10] the very same one
[2:00:13] and he's given you the very same message
[2:00:15] so if you're finding it hard to overcome
[2:00:18] why don't you ask God to give you a
[2:00:20] fresh revelation of the authority of the
[2:00:24] messenger that God sent
[2:00:26] I'm telling you whatever he taught you
[2:00:29] you can Bank your soul
[2:00:33] you can sleep easy at night knowing that
[2:00:36] your children are being raised correctly
[2:00:39] knowing that if you say father there
[2:00:42] will be a father to answer yes my child
[2:00:44] that if you have a need he's a very
[2:00:47] present help in a time of trouble that
[2:00:50] if the Devil comes in like a flood don't
[2:00:52] worry God will raise a standard up
[2:00:55] against him
[2:00:56] I'm going to pray for you master
[2:00:59] I thank you for this service tonight
[2:01:02] it's went long Lord longer than I
[2:01:04] intended but I was under strict orders
[2:01:06] to finish this sermon if I had to stay
[2:01:08] here to midnight
[2:01:10] I tried to go forth as studiously as I
[2:01:13] could I tried to say everything you
[2:01:14] wanted said I believe I have have I have
[2:01:17] no regrets I I said it with a pure heart
[2:01:19] with love that's the truth if anybody
[2:01:23] thinks I
[2:01:24] if my if my righteous indignation came
[2:01:28] across like as if I'm angry well
[2:01:30] righteous indignation kind of looks like
[2:01:32] that but it's righteous because I'm
[2:01:34] zealous for God's word and I care about
[2:01:37] people
[2:01:38] and sometimes I feel like I just have to
[2:01:41] smash people to get them to open their
[2:01:44] eyes come to your senses
[2:01:47] Shake Yourself Samson the Philistines
[2:01:51] are upon thee

[2:01:58] help me helpless people there's an
[2:02:01] internet audience Lord I know that
[2:02:03] especially on Wednesday nights Lord I'm
[2:02:06] informed by our audio video team manager
[2:02:09] that Wednesday night we have the most
[2:02:11] Life Connections from all over

[2:02:17] asking for your mercy for all of our
[2:02:19] Lives Lord Jesus
[2:02:21] and help us father help us won't you
[2:02:24] give us a greater confidence in the
[2:02:27] messenger you sent

[2:02:32] help us to kick things out of our lives
[2:02:35] and out of our homes
[2:02:36] and kick them out once and for all
[2:02:39] and say I'm done with that

[2:03:15] I'm praying for their spirit I don't
[2:03:17] want to see anyone
[2:03:20] feel offended
[2:03:23] never had that intention
[2:03:26] but what I've said has been said in
[2:03:28] honesty and it needed to be said it
[2:03:32] needed to be established and nailed down
[2:03:34] as the prophet said I've got to hammer
[2:03:35] it until the nail clinches
[2:03:41] so I commit it now to you I know nothing
[2:03:43] more to say or do
[2:03:45] I commit the balance of this service
[2:03:48] into your hands in Jesus name
