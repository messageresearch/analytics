[6:56] today? One day is coming. Oh, glorious
[6:59] day.

[8:05] [Applause]
[8:07] [Music]
[8:10] Glorious day.
[8:13] [Applause]
[8:14] Let's start our verse now.
[8:19] One day when heaven
[8:21] was filled with his praises,
[8:25] one day when sin was as black as could
[8:29] be,
[8:31] Jesus came forth to be born of a virgin,
[8:37] dwelt among men. My example is he.
[8:43] The word became flesh and the light
[8:47] dwelt among us. His glory revealed
[8:53] that living he loved me and dying he
[8:57] saved me and buried he carried my sin
[9:02] far away. Oh rising, he justified
[9:08] freely forever.
[9:11] One day he's coming.
[9:14] Glorious day.
[9:17] Let's go up, brother Andrew.
[9:20] I want to get right.
[9:22] [Music]
[9:24] One day they led him up Calvar's
[9:28] mountain.
[9:30] And one day they nailed him to die on a
[9:34] tree. Oh, suffering, anguish,
[9:39] despised and rejected.
[9:43] Bearing my sin, my redeemer is he.
[9:49] Hands that healed nation, stretched out
[9:53] on a tree,
[9:55] and took the nails for me.
[9:59] Living he loved me and dying he saved
[10:04] me. Buried he carried my sin far away.
[10:10] Oh rising he justified
[10:14] freely forever.
[10:17] And one day he's coming.
[10:20] Oh glorious day. Oh glorious day.
[10:30] Glorious day.
[10:34] Let's sing this now. One day the grave,
[10:39] one day the grave could conceal him no
[10:44] longer.
[10:45] And one day the stone rode away from the
[10:50] door. Yes. Then he arose. Go for death
[10:55] he had conered.
[10:58] Now he's ascended
[11:01] my lord ever more.
[11:04] Death could not hold him. The grave
[11:08] could not keep him from rising again
[11:14] and living. He loved me. Oh, sing it to
[11:18] him now. Oh yes. and buried. He carried
[11:23] my sin far away. Oh, rising, he
[11:28] justified
[11:30] freely forever.
[11:33] One day he's coming. Oh, glorious day.
[11:39] Oh, glorious day.
[11:45] Glorious day.
[11:49] Don't know if you know this. One day the
[11:52] trumpet will sound for his coming.
[11:57] One day the skies with his glories will
[12:01] shine.
[12:03] Oh wonderful day my beloved
[12:07] one bringing.
[12:10] My savior Jesus is mine. Sing it to him
[12:13] now. Living he loved me. Dying he saved
[12:19] me. Buried he carried
[12:23] my sin far away. Oh and rising he
[12:28] justified
[12:30] freely forever.
[12:33] One day he's coming. Oh glorious day.
[12:39] Glorious
[12:41] day.
[12:44] Give him a praise offering. Hallelujah.
[12:48] Amen.
[12:51] Are you glad for that? Amen. Turn on and
[12:54] shake somebody's hand. Greet them this
[12:56] morning. Tell them, "God bless you. Good
[12:57] to have you here in the house of the
[12:59] Lord." Amen. Worshiping together. You
[13:01] can have your seats. Brother Aaron has a
[13:02] special for us, we'd have him come at
[13:04] this time. Amen. A group, whatever the
[13:07] group is, come on and make your way.
[13:09] Group, whoever's singing with Brother
[13:10] Aaron. Amen.
[13:13] Now, I'm going to do something and just
[13:15] because I get my once in every four
[13:17] months to lead songs, so I'm going to
[13:19] I'm going to take advantage of it. I
[13:21] want y'all to give this group not yet a
[13:24] hand. But I don't want your golf clap.
[13:29] I want a real clap as if you actually
[13:31] appreciate gifted singers that will get
[13:34] up here and sacrifice their self, put
[13:37] themsel on the spot. Let's give this
[13:39] group and brother Aaron a real hand.
[13:44] Hallelujah.
[13:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[13:51] [Music]
[14:44] Wow. I'm going to let the glory roll
[14:46] when the road is called in glory.
[14:50] I'm going to get beside of myself when I
[14:52] get beside the king that day. I'm going
[14:56] to have the time of my life when the
[14:58] time of my life is over.
[15:01] I'm going to get carried away and I get
[15:05] carried away.
[15:08] Well, I don't know why I become a little
[15:10] shy. I get around a whole lot of people.
[15:14] And I can't figure out why. I never can
[15:16] shout about the love that floods my
[15:19] soul. My confess can express feelings
[15:24] deep inside me. One day I know and
[15:27] cannot show. One day we'll overflow.
[15:32] I'm going to let the glory roll. When
[15:34] the road is called in glory,
[15:38] going to get beside of myself when I get
[15:41] beside the king that day. I'm going to
[15:44] have the time of my life. When the time
[15:46] of my life is over,
[15:50] I'm going to get carried away. When I
[15:53] get carried away,
[15:56] will I pass the clouds and shout so loud
[16:00] may sound like thunder. My cheerful eyes
[16:04] may fill the skies till it looks like
[16:07] rain. And as I leave this world, pass
[16:10] the gates of pearl. Stand before my
[16:13] savior. I'll let my soul let the glory
[16:16] roam in the ro. He calls my name. I'm
[16:21] going to let the glory roll. When the
[16:23] Lord is calling glory,
[16:26] I'm going to get beside myself. When I
[16:29] get beside the king that day, I'm going
[16:33] to have the time of my life. When the
[16:35] time of my life is over,
[16:38] I'm going to get carried away and I get
[16:42] carried away.
[16:44] I'm going to let the glory roll. When
[16:47] the road is called in glory,
[16:50] I'm going to get a side of myself. When
[16:53] I get beside the king that day, I'm
[16:57] going to have the time of my life. When
[16:59] the time of my life is over,
[17:02] I'm going to get carried away. When I
[17:05] get carried away,
[17:08] I'm going to let the glory roll. When
[17:11] the road is gone for

[17:21] to have the time of my life. When the
[17:23] time of my life is over,
[17:26] I'm going to get carried away. Carried
[17:29] away.
[17:32] When I get carried away.
[17:36] [Music]
[17:41] [Applause]
[17:44] Amen. Let's all stand to our feet this
[17:46] morning. But Luther, could you make your
[17:48] way? Lala Elohim. Brother Andrew, if you
[17:50] could play that for us. Amen. I don't
[17:53] see any needs written down, any request.
[17:56] Amen. Maybe you have something upon your
[17:58] heart. As we take up the tithes and
[17:59] offerings, we'll also take up any
[18:01] unspoken prayer request. Maybe something
[18:03] upon your heart. You just want to raise
[18:05] your hand to the Lord and let the Lord
[18:06] see that need. Say, "God, here's what I
[18:09] need today." Representing it by hand.
[18:11] The Luther come and take up the
[18:13] offerings and
[18:16] [Music]
[18:20] so a couple of written down requests. uh
[18:23] wrote a sister Jiance has a friend that
[18:26] she works for Susan McFerson
[18:30] and she has cancer and it's like six
[18:34] people in the world have had this rare
[18:35] form of cancer.
[18:38] Um
[18:39] Brad is also ministering in Ohio. We
[18:42] want to remember him. We have several
[18:44] people that we are dealing with cancer.
[18:46] Sister Melissa's mom and family because
[18:49] this is you know it changes everything.
[18:51] and the family's dealing with this and
[18:53] that. So, we want to remember them also.
[18:56] And Sister Melissa's daughter Jessica is
[18:59] traveling where we'd all want to go.
[19:01] She's going to Australia and New Zealand
[19:04] for vacation. Just want safe travel,
[19:07] have a great time, bring her back
[19:09] safely,
[19:11] eventually get her back in the house of
[19:13] the Lord. Amen. Um, cancer is just
[19:18] another thing, just a demon.
[19:20] So, you know, when people give me these
[19:22] requests,
[19:25] you know, I I'm glad it doesn't just
[19:26] rest with me, but it is a um
[19:30] my you just want God to hear you, God to
[19:33] work on their behalf. I want to remember
[19:36] our sister Kathy and brother Joel this
[19:38] morning, any others that are dealing
[19:40] with sickness or just difficulties in
[19:43] this life. Let's pray. Father, we love
[19:46] you this morning.
[19:50] You know how my heart is, Father.
[19:53] When somebody asks prayer,
[19:57] oh, how I would just want to kneel at
[19:59] your throne.
[20:01] Pray that you would hear my requests
[20:03] with a sincere heart this morning. We're
[20:06] gathered together in your name. We're
[20:08] all looking to you for the answers to
[20:09] the questions and requests of our heart,
[20:13] Lord.
[20:15] And father, you said ask anything in my
[20:19] name
[20:20] and you would do it. So we come to you
[20:23] Lord in the name of Jesus Christ this
[20:25] morning for these requests. Each and
[20:27] every one is important.
[20:29] No one is higher than the other one.
[20:33] As a human being
[20:36] that's beyond my understanding.
[20:39] But father as an eternal being,
[20:42] how you can love equally and without any
[20:47] dissimilation.
[20:49] We pray that you would move upon these
[20:51] requests. Father, bless those that are
[20:53] streaming.
[20:55] Lord, as we collect the tithes and
[20:56] offerings, bless the cheerful giver.
[20:59] Magnify your kingdom in our hearts this
[21:02] morning.
[21:03] We thank you for the bounty that you
[21:05] give us in Jesus name. Amen.

[26:10] When uh Brother Matt and I were in
[26:12] Poland recently,
[26:14] I was just taken back. It just it left
[26:17] me amazed that they do that as well.
[26:21] Except they do it a long time. They
[26:25] said, "Give the Lord a hand." And they
[26:27] started clapping all over, thunderous.
[26:30] And it just kept going and and even I
[26:33] was like, "Okay, are we done?" It just
[26:34] kept going and I just thought, "Wow,
[26:37] Lord, my goodness, what a welcome of the
[26:40] Holy Spirit." So, you know, we're we're
[26:42] not just clapping for the sake of a
[26:45] tradition, but because we love the Lord.
[26:48] Amen. We want to make him welcome. Amen.
[26:51] God bless. You can be seated for just a
[26:53] moment. Amen. Let me uh pause the music.
[26:56] I'm going to make just a few quick
[26:57] announcements here. Let me get to the
[26:59] right right area.
[27:05] Tell the president I can't talk right
[27:07] now. I'm in the pull pit. And
[27:09] Amen. I don't know why he calls me at
[27:12] work.
[27:15] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[27:18] You love the Lord.
[27:20] Amen. We have a a wonderful opportunity
[27:24] today. I get to do one of my favorite
[27:26] things and that's dedicate a baby. Man,
[27:28] we are dedicating a lot of babies.
[27:31] Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[27:37] So, um, as such, we we kind of have some
[27:41] plans. And I say plans because they're
[27:43] not uh all completed yet. But you're
[27:46] going to notice on the back side of the
[27:48] fellowship hall, a little playground.
[27:51] And um now we're I say we're not
[27:53] finished cuz we're going to build
[27:55] another play area for our um our regular
[27:59] size kids because we got a ton of them
[28:01] as well. But um and we're going to put,
[28:04] you know, something bigger um bigger
[28:06] swings and slide and monkey bars and
[28:08] things like that. Do they still call
[28:10] them that or jungle gym? Yeah, I used to
[28:12] call them monkey bars and I was and I
[28:14] and I and I hung from them constantly.
[28:17] But um so what we built out here is just
[28:20] for our little carpet crawlers. And so
[28:24] um and because we got a ton of them, I
[28:26] was noticing uh I was noticing Uriah
[28:28] standing up and I couldn't believe it. I
[28:31] tell you what, the way that kid screams
[28:33] and yells and preaches in service and
[28:35] he's already standing up. He's going to
[28:37] be running the aisles before long.
[28:41] Yes, sir. Getting his license next week.
[28:43] And so, and so we've got a we've got a a
[28:47] quite a a little group of little guys.
[28:49] And so, just remember that that is kind
[28:52] of held for our our very little
[28:55] children. Uh, you know, probably
[28:56] somewhere up around four or five years
[28:58] old and under. Um, because after that,
[29:01] the the stuff we're putting out there is
[29:02] not going to hold up to larger kids. And
[29:04] neither will uh larger kids be able to
[29:07] run around out there. It's not a very
[29:08] big spot. So, it's just about perfect
[29:11] for our little bitty guys and gals. And
[29:13] so, we're going to build something for
[29:15] our six, seven, eight, nine, 10 year
[29:17] olds, I don't know, um to get out there
[29:19] on. Uh we'll build that um later, but uh
[29:22] we have that uh for you waiting. And
[29:25] moms can go out there. We put a nice
[29:27] shade on it. And I just appreciate all
[29:29] the hard work that went on there. And
[29:32] there's uh probably more people than I
[29:33] even am aware uh that were involved in
[29:37] that. And uh I know brother Matt and
[29:39] Sister Rachel kind of headed that up. Uh
[29:42] but they had lots of help. Every time
[29:43] we'd go in there, there'd be different
[29:45] teams of people working and equipment
[29:47] running and it just uh they did it in
[29:49] record time. I couldn't even believe it.
[29:51] Now, Sister Rachel said there's a
[29:52] there's actually a little playhouse that
[29:55] hasn't arrived yet. It was supposed to
[29:56] arrive Friday and then Saturday and
[29:58] FedEx dropped the ball. But anyway, that
[30:01] we should have that Monday. I think they
[30:03] will have um I believe there's a a
[30:05] little slide or something going out
[30:07] there already. Um but you'll see it's
[30:09] just tiny. So, uh we're happy for that.
[30:12] I want to give all of those who made an
[30:14] effort and worked on that. Amen. Another
[30:17] Amen.
[30:23] And so, uh you just tell all my little
[30:25] bitty sweetie pies. We'll we're going to
[30:26] build one for the older ones. Uh, but
[30:29] we'll keep this one for our little Amen.
[30:31] I call them carpet crawlers. Amen.
[30:33] Praise the Lord. All right. Praise the
[30:35] Lord. All right. Brother Andrew, give us
[30:38] the uh the the song. Bring them in.
[30:41] Bring them in. Bring them in from the
[30:42] fields of sin. Going to invite Brother
[30:45] Matt and Sister Katie to come at this
[30:47] time. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen.
[30:51] And and anybody that wants to come and
[30:53] take pictures, you can. Oh, bring them
[30:56] in.
[30:58] Oh, bring them in. Oh my. Bring them in
[31:04] from the fields of sin.
[31:08] Bring them in.
[31:13] Oh, she's laughing already. Bring the
[31:16] little ones to Jesus.
[31:19] [Music]
[31:22] You know, she's going to drop that Kate.
[31:24] Okay. Oh, it's hooked to her. Wow. Okay.
[31:26] You can't even get away from that
[31:27] pacifier, young lady. Let me let me get
[31:30] a hold of this. All right. Wow. Oh no.
[31:34] Oh. Oh. Oh. Now get up and take a look.
[31:36] Take a look. There's your paparazzi
[31:38] moment. All right.
[31:43] You know, we sing bring them in from the
[31:45] fields of sin. We know that children are
[31:47] innocent. And she hasn't even figured
[31:49] out how to lie yet. But she will. And
[31:52] because they're born in sin and uh we
[31:56] realize that we want to give them back
[31:58] to the one who gave it uh so that he can
[32:00] be her truest father and her mother and
[32:03] her brother and her sister. Amen. Praise
[32:06] the Lord. Oh, okay. Wait, hold on. Don't
[32:09] break a record and cry on me.
[32:12] She's like going, "Wow, think about it."
[32:16] Full name.
[32:17] &gt;&gt; Celestine Rose.
[32:18] &gt;&gt; Celestine Rose. Oh, how beautiful. Okay,
[32:21] princess. Here we go. Let's pray.
[32:25] Father, what a bundle of love I hold in
[32:27] my hands our little sister Celeststeine
[32:30] Rose. And Lord God, this is the time
[32:33] when parents come and admit freely and
[32:35] openly, Lord, that they don't have the
[32:38] ability to to do the job sufficiently.
[32:41] They need you, Lord. So, we're bringing
[32:43] her in dedication to you, Lord. We don't
[32:45] baptize little babies. She wouldn't even
[32:47] know what that's about. But Lord, we can
[32:49] dedicate her to you and lift her to you
[32:51] and ask that you would watch over her
[32:53] life. Keep her strong and in health.
[32:56] Lord God, may she be raised in the
[32:58] admonition of God taught the ways of the
[33:01] Lord. Not just Lord, your acts and
[33:03] history, but the ways of the Lord that
[33:05] can only come through demonstration. So
[33:07] I pray you anoint the parents for this
[33:09] task, Lord. It's a great task. The world
[33:12] is careless with it today. But your
[33:15] family, Lord, pay attention to these
[33:17] things. So we give her to you now in
[33:20] dedication to the Lord Jesus Christ for
[33:23] a life of health and safety and service
[33:26] to the king in Jesus name. Amen. All
[33:30] right. All right.
[33:34] All right.
[33:36] Okay.
[33:37] Amen.
[33:39] Amen. Oh goodness.
[33:44] Amen. If grandpa wants to do that again
[33:46] when he gets here, we'll let him. Amen.
[33:48] Praise the Lord. God bless you. Give him
[33:50] a hand this morning.
[33:53] [Applause]
[33:58] Amen. Praise God. Praise the Lord. So,
[34:03] Sister Emily, I'm looking for Brother
[34:04] Tom today. Is he here or is he
[34:07] uh Is your dad here? Oh, I thought he
[34:10] was coming here. Not Oh, okay. All
[34:14] right. Go get him real quick. We'll
[34:15] wait. Yeah. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[34:19] Always enjoy seeing Brother Tom. Let's
[34:21] stand back to our feet.
[34:25] Praise the Lord.
[34:27] I believe um I believe I gave John 17:es
[34:32] 3:5. We're going to continue today. This
[34:34] will be the seventh installment
[34:37] on future events becoming clear in
[34:39] prophecy. I I trust you're enjoying this
[34:42] series. I certainly am enjoying it. It's
[34:45] so instructive and makes clear so many
[34:49] things. You know, I'm so grateful to the
[34:51] Lord for the word that we have because
[34:55] our hearts don't fail for fear because a
[34:58] fear, the greatest fear is always a fear
[35:00] of the unknown. So, I'm glad he has
[35:02] revealed to us everything pertinent to
[35:05] our life and gives us understanding not
[35:08] only of what we see around us, but so we
[35:10] can understand ourselves. Amen. and
[35:13] believe that we are part of the plan.
[35:16] That is the most beautiful thing. I
[35:18] would say friends that the most
[35:20] beautiful thing that the seventh seal
[35:22] unveiled was the mystery of the bride in
[35:25] Christ. Amen. That she is Mrs. Jesus
[35:28] Christ. Amen. John 17
[35:32] verses 3 to 5.
[35:35] And this is life eternal that they may
[35:38] know thee, the only true God, and Jesus
[35:42] Christ, whom thou hast sent. I have
[35:45] glorified thee on the earth. I have
[35:48] finished the work which thou gavest me
[35:50] to do. And now, oh Father, glorify thou
[35:54] me with thine own self, with the glory
[35:58] which I had with thee before the world
[36:02] was. Amen. May the Lord add the blessing
[36:06] to the reading of the word. You can be
[36:07] seated. We sure enjoyed our time last
[36:10] night uh with brother Samuel yesterday
[36:13] morning and evening. Had a wonderful
[36:15] time of fellowship around the word. It
[36:17] was good to see brother Joe and sister
[36:19] Jessica. And uh maybe we might be able
[36:22] to get some fellowship from them in the
[36:24] later afternoon if they get freed up
[36:26] over there with the Spanish saints. They
[36:27] thought they might wind their way over
[36:29] to the fellowship hall. got a a nice u
[36:32] some act some activities and food and
[36:34] fellowship planned for after the service
[36:36] today. I think you've probably seen the
[36:38] announcement. Amen. We've sent sent it
[36:41] out and sent out reminders as well.
[36:43] Amen. So, we had been last time dealing
[36:49] with um bringing you I don't know if I
[36:52] don't remember if I read it or not, but
[36:54] when we look at Romans 19 from the New
[36:58] Living Translation,
[37:00] uh Romans 8:19 says, "For all creation
[37:04] is waiting eagerly for that future day."
[37:08] Are you looking forward to that future
[37:10] day?
[37:11] Three people. I saw two hands and heard
[37:14] one amen. Are you looking forward to
[37:16] that future day? You may not be looking
[37:18] forward to the future day of the of the
[37:20] world. It's pretty dismal. But but this
[37:22] is the day when he says when God will
[37:25] reveal who his children really are.
[37:28] Brother Brandham called that the Mount
[37:31] Zion showdown. I don't mean to imply he
[37:33] directly referenced Romans 8:19, but it
[37:36] but but this is what that is. It's a
[37:38] Mount Zion showdown. And we find that in
[37:42] Revelation 14, you find that you have
[37:45] the 144,000 standing on the Mount Zion.
[37:49] And of course, Zion is always the bride.
[37:52] So, it's not standing, you know, on
[37:54] Mount Zion, but it's careful to say on
[37:56] the Mount Zion. So, you have the bride
[37:59] and the 144,000.
[38:01] Later on down lower, you find that you
[38:04] you find the remnant of the woman's seed
[38:06] down there. Now, they don't go into uh
[38:09] the millennium with us, but uh you say,
[38:11] "Well, why would they not if they're in
[38:13] the same place as the bride and the
[38:15] 144,000 and they're shown in the same
[38:17] chapter?" But remember, you don't read
[38:19] the book of Revelation like a newspaper
[38:21] linearly in every way. Uh and we find
[38:24] out that the reason that the 144,000 do
[38:27] go into the millennium as attendance to
[38:30] the bride is because they receive the
[38:33] same message that you have received. And
[38:36] with that they receive the same Holy
[38:38] Ghost that you have received. They are
[38:41] born again. Therefore, they are made
[38:43] part of the first resurrection upon whom
[38:46] the second death hath no power. I I
[38:49] enjoy knowing that the second death
[38:53] already has no power on me. This body
[38:56] might lay down. The Lord finishes me
[38:58] with this body lays down and I go on and
[39:01] and but but but I have my future is
[39:04] bright. Amen.
[39:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so I did not start here and I
[39:08] am not ending here. And brother Brandham
[39:11] deals with that where Jesus is saying
[39:13] you know uh in my father's house are
[39:15] many mansions. And so if it were I I
[39:17] would have told you and I go to prepare
[39:19] place and brother Brandham said what
[39:21] Jesus was saying to his disciples and
[39:24] this is a a massive point that every
[39:26] human needs to take notice of that this
[39:29] life is not ended in death.
[39:32] That's what he was trying to comfort
[39:34] them with. This life is not ended in
[39:36] death. That's why you've heard me say
[39:38] for years. This life really isn't about
[39:40] this life per se. It's about the next
[39:42] one. And so Jesus told us lay up
[39:44] treasures for that life coming right
[39:47] here. I have a mission. We've discussed
[39:49] that. We've we've taught on it. And we
[39:51] fig we we realize now that he is coming
[39:54] to a uh what we have been seeing through
[39:57] the church ages. And we've been showing
[39:59] this. I'm not going to go back over it
[40:01] today, but we are now at a uh completing
[40:06] a 6,000year
[40:08] mission. Uh and he's now ready to take
[40:11] the next step. What he's doing is
[40:13] redeeming all creation, not just a
[40:17] gentile bride. There's a Hebrew part of
[40:19] the bride.
[40:21] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram says that the Hebrew part
[40:23] of it. And so so we realize that when he
[40:25] he talks about that on that great
[40:28] morning that Hebrew part of the bride
[40:30] will lead the way and then the gentile
[40:33] bride will fall in and then the last age
[40:35] will fall in in their order and away we
[40:38] go to the sky. Oh, I'm glad that's not a
[40:41] movie. That's not something by Disney.
[40:43] That's they've never thought about
[40:44] something so glorious as that. That's a
[40:47] real event that we you have a ticket to.
[40:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. You have a token for that.
[40:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:56] &gt;&gt; So we realize that after the millennium
[40:59] then the seven seventh the 7,000 years
[41:03] is finished that seventh section of a
[41:05] thousand years at the end of the
[41:07] millennium and then he redeems the earth
[41:09] and it becomes a new heaven and a new
[41:11] earth. So I I want you to realize
[41:14] friends I want you to think of it this
[41:16] way and here's why. Because too many
[41:20] times we live at ground zero and we get
[41:23] so um we get so astonished at things
[41:27] that befall us
[41:29] &gt;&gt; or happen in our lives. Sometimes it
[41:31] looks like misfortune. We know that all
[41:34] things must work together for the good
[41:36] of them that love him.
[41:37] &gt;&gt; But we also know that he doesn't promise
[41:39] everything will be good only that
[41:41] they'll all work together for your good.
[41:44] So sometimes we find ourselves in the
[41:46] midst of trials and tribulations that we
[41:49] didn't expect. We wouldn't have chosen
[41:51] and we would have avoided if we could
[41:54] have saw them coming. Uh because I've
[41:57] got all of that. I sure don't want to
[41:58] add extra corrective measures to my
[42:01] life. I'm already in in it for training.
[42:04] Uh, God forbid I would live in such a
[42:07] way that I would actually add extra
[42:09] layers of God having to come down in in
[42:12] loving chastisement. As brother Jason
[42:14] was talking this morning, real agape
[42:16] love is the only real love there is.
[42:19] It's the love of a father. And that's I
[42:22] I was so enjoying that lesson today. And
[42:24] so so we find that that that this is why
[42:28] I have I I want you to understand it's
[42:31] uh it's larger than you. It's bigger
[42:34] than your trial. I don't care how big
[42:36] your trial is. And and and listen,
[42:40] you're you're it's all bigger than this
[42:42] one whole one church here. It's bigger
[42:44] than the bride. It's the He's redeeming
[42:47] all creation.
[42:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, a lot of times when Satan
[42:52] wants you to focus down on, you know,
[42:54] and get you in that what Brother Juwel
[42:56] called wowy wowsy woo, you know, uh that
[43:00] that little, you know, uh me me monster
[43:03] party that we sometimes get into and
[43:05] little pity party and uh but it's bigger
[43:08] than you. I you know, I say that to
[43:10] young people. I say, listen, you know,
[43:12] you you get this going on in your home
[43:14] and maybe you don't like this and that
[43:15] and the other and mom and dad you don't
[43:17] like their decision. This is bigger than
[43:18] you. Amen.
[43:19] &gt;&gt; This is a whole family you're a part of.
[43:21] There's a name to be upheld and and
[43:24] there's the name of Christ. We should
[43:25] live above reproach
[43:28] &gt;&gt; on purpose.
[43:30] &gt;&gt; See, on purpose.
[43:33] So, so we find that it's it's as mankind
[43:38] has now coming down to his long
[43:42] multi,000year run, a 6,000 year run in a
[43:46] fallen condition. And that's over.
[43:49] that's ending. And uh and and and then
[43:52] at the end of the millennium, the whole
[43:54] the whole mission to redeem all of
[43:56] creation goes forward. And I I'm just
[44:00] glad to know that I am included in that.
[44:04] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm trying to be um rather
[44:08] meticulous today. I want to go point by
[44:10] point and I'm not going to keep you, you
[44:12] know, but I do want to cover my ground
[44:14] and when we'll I think I know where I
[44:16] can get to and we won't try to press it
[44:17] beyond that because this series is
[44:19] pretty heavy. We're teaching a lot of
[44:21] different things. We've talked a lot
[44:24] about the letter H that was added to the
[44:26] name of Abraham making his name to Abram
[44:30] making his name Abram. We've showed you
[44:32] the difference between uh you know in in
[44:36] English and these things are all
[44:37] important. This isn't just knowledge for
[44:39] the sake of knowledge. But in Abram, we
[44:41] have five English letters, but there's
[44:43] only four in the Hebrew. In Abraham, we
[44:45] have seven English letters, but there's
[44:47] only five in Hebrew. And so, we realize
[44:51] and many many scholars, Rashi, as I told
[44:54] you, one of the leading commentators
[44:56] today, uh, his notes are cover every
[44:59] modern prince, every modern printing of
[45:01] the Torah. Uh and and so he he rather
[45:04] supposes that this five letters to the
[45:06] name of Abraham are aspects of Abraham's
[45:10] trials as major testing stages in
[45:12] Abraham's life. He refers it to five
[45:14] commandments or acts taken from the
[45:16] Torah as behaviors foreshadowing the
[45:18] Mosaic law. And so um so that's fine. I
[45:22] I get that. And I in fact as I I
[45:25] appreciate you know the aspect of of of
[45:28] him knowing that there was something
[45:31] significant to the name change that and
[45:35] this is where I want we're really going
[45:36] to look at it today and and I was so
[45:39] astonished that brother Matt would be
[45:40] singing lai Elohim. And so uh we're
[45:44] going to look at that as we get down to
[45:46] it here. Just let me go through uh I've
[45:48] got this laid out so I keep myself in
[45:50] line. So we find then that um with only
[45:55] five Hebrew letters in the name Abraham
[45:58] as opposed to seven letters in the King
[46:00] James Bible. Now this kind of um um
[46:04] numerology and things that we notice you
[46:07] you can't go to seed on that but brother
[46:09] Brandham talks about numerology is
[46:11] perfect in the scriptures and threes and
[46:13] fives and sevens and you know and and
[46:16] we're not here to preach on Bible
[46:17] numerology but it's important and you
[46:21] need to you need to understand
[46:23] that him calling you Mrs. Jesus Christ
[46:28] is not an insignificant thing and it's
[46:32] certainly not just a grand title that
[46:34] you get to go, "Oh, I'm Mrs. Jesus
[46:37] Christ." Uh, it's it's so much more
[46:39] about that as you'll see it as we
[46:41] develop it here. You find, and this is
[46:44] one of my favorite places to notice it
[46:47] in the book of Esther in the first
[46:50] chapter in the 10th verse. You might
[46:52] want to follow me on this one, Brother
[46:53] Kev. Esther 1 verse 10. You're going to
[46:57] notice how that it opens up in this 10th
[46:59] verse. On the seventh day, not the
[47:02] first, second, third, fourth, fifth, or
[47:04] sixth. On the seventh day, when the
[47:07] heart of the king was merry with wine,
[47:10] he commanded and he goes through all of
[47:12] these names. I'm not going to try to
[47:14] pronounce them. I want you to notice the
[47:16] se the the seventh one. Carass. All
[47:19] right? and Carass, the seven chamberlins
[47:23] chamberlains that serve in the presence
[47:26] of Ahazerus the king. All right. Uh get
[47:30] ready for Revelation chapter 1 in
[47:32] Matthew 24, but we'll get there in a
[47:33] minute, Kevin. I I'll give you the high
[47:34] sign. So, these seven chamberlains are
[47:39] are royal officials with royal authority
[47:44] and they serve at the pleasure of the
[47:46] king. They are in fact appointed by the
[47:48] king and they serve as supervisors and
[47:51] administrators over the kingdom. These
[47:55] are some heavy hitters. These are the
[47:57] guys you want. You want to be in their
[47:59] favor because they answer to no one but
[48:02] the king.
[48:03] &gt;&gt; And they administrate his laws. They
[48:06] supervise over the kingdom and
[48:08] administrate to make sure that the
[48:10] wishes of the king regarding and you're
[48:13] going to see here in a minute that it
[48:15] even has an effect on his family. So
[48:19] when we look at this at that name Carass
[48:22] you will notice that it only has six
[48:26] letters. Now that's important. All
[48:28] right. So because that when we when we
[48:33] when we see that let me let me catch
[48:35] this one first Kevin give me Revelation
[48:36] 1 uh verse 4 John to the seven churches
[48:43] which are in Asia. Grace be unto you and
[48:47] peace from him which is and which was
[48:50] and which is to come from the seven
[48:53] spirits which are before the throne. So
[48:56] you're seeing a perfect pattern in the
[48:59] seventh day. You've got seven
[49:01] chamberlins, right? Who who are the
[49:04] administrators? And when John sees it,
[49:07] sees the one there, he sees the seven
[49:10] spirits of God who who are who are doing
[49:12] what? They are before his throne. So we
[49:16] know in our teaching that these seven
[49:18] spirits anoint seven messengers. And
[49:21] those messengers come with the authority
[49:24] of the king. They serve at the pleasure
[49:25] of the king. Everything that they are
[49:28] teaching is what God is revealing from
[49:31] his throne.
[49:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:33] &gt;&gt; And in the ages when you know in the
[49:36] middle when it's an ad mixture that's
[49:38] okay because Christ is seated in the
[49:40] eternity interceding for that ignorance.
[49:43] All right. Then when we come to Matthew
[49:45] 24. All right. We find where Jesus now
[49:50] is giving a prophecy of the end time.
[49:53] Matthew 24:26-28.
[49:56] Wherefore, if they say shall say unto
[49:59] you, Behold, he is in the desert, go not
[50:02] forth. Behold, he is in the secret
[50:04] chambers, believe it not. For as the
[50:07] lightning cometh out of the east, and
[50:09] shineth even to the west, so shall also
[50:14] the coming of the Son of Man be. For
[50:17] wheresoever the carcass is, there will
[50:21] the eagles be gathered. Only now it's
[50:24] not six letters, it's seven letters.
[50:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; Where the carcass is. You say, "But wait
[50:30] a minute. One is speaking of it's a
[50:33] man's personal name and this one is
[50:35] speaking of an animal." They're both
[50:37] typing what God is doing in his word.
[50:40] And in fact is you remember last time
[50:43] when they asked Jesus and I don't know
[50:45] if I still have that Jesus starts
[50:47] talking about you remember we read it in
[50:49] Luke 17 he starts talking about you know
[50:52] I'm going here I'm going there and
[50:53] they're asking him where Lord
[50:56] &gt;&gt; because they think he's talking about a
[50:58] GPS location and his answer to and they
[51:02] answered and said unto him Luke 17:37
[51:05] and they answered and said unto him
[51:07] where Lord and he said unto him
[51:10] wheresoever the body is thither will the
[51:13] eagles be gathered together. So so we're
[51:16] coming down and when I when I begin to
[51:19] go back and I begin to look at at at
[51:22] church age commentators and even all the
[51:24] way into the into the modern day of
[51:26] commentators on the Bible going all the
[51:29] way back as far as I could find and I
[51:31] went all the way back. You're going to
[51:32] see here in a minute we've got some all
[51:34] the way way way back. And so, but the
[51:37] best commentators
[51:39] uh take Matthew 24
[51:43] where for whsoever the carcass is, there
[51:47] will the eagles be gathered together.
[51:49] And so you can't tell me that it's an
[51:52] accident that on the seventh day several
[51:54] in cha seven chamberlains come and one
[51:57] has six letters carcass but in the New
[51:59] Testament it's now a different symbol
[52:02] attached to something different and it's
[52:04] attached to the feast of the word and
[52:06] it's seven letters and that's I'm I'm
[52:08] saying to you it's not unfounded in the
[52:11] Bible for God to have changed Abraham's
[52:14] name from Abram to Abraham and that
[52:18] going from 5 to 7 in English is
[52:21] significant.
[52:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:26] &gt;&gt; But but when I looked at the
[52:27] commentators and I I was stunned because
[52:31] the best of them put Matthew 24 for
[52:35] wheresoever the carcass is, there will
[52:38] the eagles be gathered together. Now we
[52:40] know that's today a feast of the word.
[52:43] &gt;&gt; As the lightning shineth out of the east
[52:45] unto the west, that's now. And that's
[52:47] the time when we have the carcass, seven
[52:49] letters, the feast of the word of God.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; See,
[52:54] so I here's here's one that was
[52:57] reflective of all of them. The IVP Bible
[52:59] background commentary of the in the Old
[53:01] Testament or rather actually on the New
[53:04] Testament. They have an Old Testament
[53:05] and New Testament. This is from the New
[53:07] Testament. It's actually believes that
[53:10] this is a scripture applied to the
[53:14] tribulation period. And it goes further
[53:17] in its error to believe that Jesus's
[53:20] return will not be a secret event.
[53:24] Wrong.
[53:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:26] &gt;&gt; First mistake. Matthew 24 uh 28 is not
[53:31] in the tribulation. It's before the
[53:33] tribulation. And it's a bride feeding on
[53:36] the body word of the son of man.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; It's it it certainly is a secret
[53:41] catching away. He comes as a thief in
[53:43] the night. Listen friends, they say,
[53:45] "Well, but the Bible says every eye
[53:47] shall see him." Sure, when he comes back
[53:49] in Revelation 19, every eye shall see
[53:51] him. But that's not a happy time.
[53:55] &gt;&gt; The Bible says they wail because of
[53:57] that. That doesn't sound like the
[53:59] coming, the second coming of the Lord
[54:01] that the world is looking for.
[54:04] They go on to postulate this and
[54:08] postulate that and it appears to have
[54:10] been a well-known proverbial saying. And
[54:13] one view of its meaning is that Jesus
[54:15] meant that the false messiahs and the
[54:18] false prophets were similar to vultures.
[54:20] Okay. Amen. Thank you. I like that. They
[54:23] would be trying and then they go right
[54:26] off into the ditch again. They would be
[54:28] trying to pick the corpse of the dead
[54:30] Israelites clean for their own advantage
[54:32] when Jesus returned.
[54:35] Wow. Thank God for a prophet.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then they as almost like a
[54:41] footnote they mention there is there is
[54:43] a possibility in view of the context
[54:46] that the corpse refers to Christ and the
[54:50] vultures are God's children gathered to
[54:52] feed on him. Okay, keep coming. You're
[54:56] getting warm. You're getting warm.
[54:58] Remember the little game we played as
[54:59] kids? You're getting warm. You're
[55:00] getting cold. You're getting cold.
[55:02] However, right as they're getting warm,
[55:04] however, the idea of feeding on Christ
[55:07] is foreign to the context and the
[55:09] comparison of him to carrying is
[55:10] unappealing. Oh my, oh my, no wonder
[55:13] they love their rituals and their
[55:15] traditions and their denominations and
[55:17] their ivory towers and their crystal
[55:18] cathedrals. But I'm telling you, the the
[55:21] body word is what we feed on and it's
[55:23] what we love. And we don't we're not
[55:25] looking for pomp and circumstance. I'm
[55:27] looking to be like him.
[55:31] I'm feeding on the body word of the son
[55:33] of man. So they end up missing the whole
[55:36] thing. They literally miss the feast of
[55:38] the word that is promised to God's
[55:42] family in the last days.
[55:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:45] &gt;&gt; They miss the six letters to seven
[55:49] letters at the end time between the
[55:53] messenger to Sodom and the messenger to
[55:55] the bride.
[55:57] &gt;&gt; They missed that completely. And I and
[55:59] and brother Brandham says, "Never have
[56:01] we had a messenger to the church with
[56:05] the last three letters ham." See,
[56:08] because you remember that brother
[56:10] Brandham said, "It's the H from Elohim."
[56:12] And that's super important. Just in a
[56:13] minute. Not from Jehovah, per se.
[56:16] They're the same person. Elohim and
[56:18] Jehovah, the same person. But Brother
[56:20] Brandham constantly says it was he took
[56:22] it from Elohim. Hi M. And he says, "Look
[56:25] at Dr. Billy Graham. H A M." There's
[56:27] that H. Brother Brown says, "But it's
[56:29] only six letters."
[56:31] &gt;&gt; And he says, "But Abraham, that was
[56:33] seven letters. It wasn't the angel that
[56:35] went to Sodom. That's not my messenger.
[56:39] Because I'm not in Sodom. Why am I not?"
[56:41] Cuz Abraham uh Lot lifted up his eyes
[56:44] and looked toward the fertile fields and
[56:46] said, "Man, I could really do good down
[56:47] there in Sodom." But Abraham said, "I
[56:49] want nothing to do with the things of
[56:52] the world. I want to stay right here
[56:54] with my Lord
[56:56] &gt;&gt; and have communion with him.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:00] &gt;&gt; And he says, notice it was seven
[57:02] letters. That's that uh in the name of
[57:04] Abraham. He was not it was not the
[57:07] sixletter messenger. I looked back as
[57:09] far as as Augustine and origin and uh in
[57:14] in Augustine rather the in his book the
[57:17] city of God uh book uh Roman nubal. Come
[57:20] on. That would be 16. Book 16 describes
[57:24] Abraham's name change as a divine sign
[57:28] of God's covenant and Abraham's enlarged
[57:31] destiny, but does not tie the change
[57:34] specifically to the name Elohim. Right.
[57:38] &gt;&gt; See, and so we we read you that some
[57:41] commentators, I read this last time, see
[57:44] it attached to Jehovah or Yahweh, which
[57:47] is Yahweh and then and then then it
[57:49] becomes Jehovah. And I don't want to go
[57:51] through the linguistic breakdown of all
[57:52] of that, but I'll just give you the the
[57:54] important highlights, but they're all I
[57:58] found a uniform agreement. Origin the
[58:01] same thing. his homalies on Genesis. He
[58:04] considers this the name change symbolic
[58:06] of spiritual transformation and God's
[58:08] call. But no linguistic link to Elohim
[58:12] is made.
[58:15] Medieval and Reformation era writers
[58:17] Thomas Aquinus in his Suma theologica
[58:21] refers to Abraham as a type of the
[58:23] faithful linking the name change to
[58:25] God's promise but again not to Elohim
[58:27] specifically. Martin Luther himself
[58:29] emphasizes the covenantal implications
[58:32] and divine promise wrapped in the name
[58:34] change. God makes Abra Abram Abraham to
[58:37] signify his role as father of nations.
[58:39] Luther refers to God broadly but not
[58:42] with a focus on Elohim.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; Adam Clark in the early 1800s suggests
[58:47] the added letter H is symbolic and notes
[58:50] rabbitic suggestions but again no tie to
[58:54] Elohim. Oh my. And but yet, brother
[58:58] Brandham comes to us and he and he lifts
[59:01] it from the scripture that Abraham
[59:05] called him Elohim.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; Now, you don't linguistically find that
[59:10] that's not the word he uses in in
[59:12] Genesis 18:1. He uses Yahweh, which is
[59:15] like Jehovah.
[59:18] And and and you but you do find Brother
[59:20] Brandon wasn't wrong because he didn't
[59:22] he says Abraham called him that. And
[59:24] that's what Abraham did. You've got if
[59:25] you just keep reading a little more into
[59:27] Genesis 21, you'll find Abraham using
[59:29] it. You go on to Genesis 22, that's the
[59:32] very thing. And Abraham said, "My son
[59:35] Elohim will provide himself a lamb for a
[59:38] burnt offering."
[59:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; All right. And so, so and and in Genesis
[59:44] 21:33, "And Abraham planted the grove in
[59:46] Basheba and called there on the name of
[59:48] Elohim, the everlasting God." All right.
[59:52] Uh, it's a it's a it's a a variation of
[59:55] LML lam, but it means everlasting God.
[59:58] Same thing. So, I don't want to get too
[59:59] much into the weeds on this on this
[1:00:01] breakdown. I'm just giving you the
[1:00:02] highlights.
[1:00:04] I'm just showing you that a prophet was
[1:00:07] not wrong when he's noticing this. Amen.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; And so now again, not linguistically
[1:00:13] speaking, but as a as a as a as an
[1:00:17] application, as a theological theme, uh
[1:00:21] Jehovah
[1:00:23] uh seen as God as a father dwelling with
[1:00:28] his children. You remember that as he
[1:00:30] led Israel, remember he said to Moses in
[1:00:34] Exodus 4, I believe he said, "Say unto
[1:00:38] Pharaoh, Israel is my son."
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; You remember over in Deuteronomy where
[1:00:45] Mo Moses tells the people that God has
[1:00:48] carried you like a father would carry a
[1:00:51] son. See? So, so we realize then that
[1:00:55] that Jehovah is a name more fitting. Uh
[1:01:00] we we we see that in Exodus 4 and I I
[1:01:03] don't remember exactly in Deuteronomy,
[1:01:04] but uh he he carries him like a son. I
[1:01:06] believe it might be the even the first
[1:01:08] chapter, but but but he plainly tells
[1:01:12] Moses and I have this one. Exodus 6.
[1:01:15] Kevin, give me Exodus 6.
[1:01:20] Exodus 6:es 2 and three
[1:01:24] because here Moses plainly God plainly
[1:01:27] tells Moses and God spake unto Moses and
[1:01:31] said unto him, I am the Lord.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; Next um next and I appeared unto
[1:01:38] Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob by
[1:01:43] the name of God Almighty.
[1:01:46] Now that's El Shadai. That's the
[1:01:48] breasted one. You remember brother
[1:01:49] Brandon brings that says Abraham you're
[1:01:51] old. You're you're Sarah's old. There's
[1:01:55] no way. So nurse from me. Nurse your
[1:01:58] strength. Nurse your youth. Nurse your
[1:02:00] health. Let me say it to you today.
[1:02:02] Nurse your strength. Nurse your youth.
[1:02:04] Nurse your health. Nurse your power to
[1:02:07] overcome. He's still El Shadi.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; But by the name of God Almighty. But by
[1:02:16] my name Jehovah was I not known to them.
[1:02:21] See, so it's not now you you realize,
[1:02:24] well, wait a minute. I thought Jehovah,
[1:02:26] you know, to and said the
[1:02:29] and you know, when he sacrificed Isaac
[1:02:31] or didn't sacrifice him there and he
[1:02:32] said he called the place when he said to
[1:02:34] Isaac, the Lord will provide. And then
[1:02:36] the Bible says and it's now Jehovah Gyra
[1:02:40] because it means the Lord our provider.
[1:02:43] And he's got seven compound redemptive
[1:02:45] names. He's got actually more than that,
[1:02:47] but brother Brandham emphasized those
[1:02:49] seven. Uh and and th those were the ones
[1:02:52] that were important. God, it's the same
[1:02:54] God. It's always the same person.
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; Whether we say Holy Spirit or Holy
[1:02:59] Ghost, it's the same person. See, there
[1:03:03] is no distinction between them at all.
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; And so, um so, so I just want to make
[1:03:09] that point. So we find out then that
[1:03:14] that this would have a particular
[1:03:17] meaning to the seventh church age alone.
[1:03:21] Because not until Elijah could anyone
[1:03:26] see that the H was not taken from the
[1:03:30] name Jehovah per se, but rather and this
[1:03:34] is important to just like he was
[1:03:36] Jehovah, but he said I wasn't known by
[1:03:38] Jehovah. So these things are important
[1:03:39] to God. So it it wasn't it wasn't an age
[1:03:43] from the name Jehovah like many of the
[1:03:46] writers will agree with. But they but
[1:03:48] none of them until we come to the last
[1:03:51] day until we come to the seventh age
[1:03:53] under a seventh messenger. And he says
[1:03:56] it's not Jehovah it's Elohim. Because
[1:03:59] the family of God had waited 2,000 years
[1:04:04] to see the return of the days of Noah
[1:04:07] and the days of Lot coming
[1:04:09] simultaneously
[1:04:11] coming combined and coming to bear upon
[1:04:14] the saints. And it's at that time that
[1:04:17] he says it's Billy Graham to the church
[1:04:19] and it's seven letters to the bride. And
[1:04:22] I'm not going to call you church. I'm
[1:04:24] going to change your name. your bride.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; You're Mrs. Jesus Christ. You're the
[1:04:30] virtuous, bloodwashed virgin bride of
[1:04:34] the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; She's living her life in this age
[1:04:44] and an invisible union with the heavenly
[1:04:48] bridegroom. That's why the world looks
[1:04:49] upon us. They don't see that. They see
[1:04:52] their holiness standards. They admire
[1:04:54] that. They want to emulate that, but
[1:04:57] they're not willing to take the path it
[1:04:59] that it requires.
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; And so they they don't see that what we
[1:05:06] are in Christ identified in the word as
[1:05:10] the last day bride. They to them it
[1:05:12] looks more like a controlled cult. It
[1:05:14] couldn't be anything further from the
[1:05:16] truth than that.
[1:05:18] But you understand I don't judge them
[1:05:20] too harshly because our union with
[1:05:22] Christ is invisible.
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; You you have to be inside the union to
[1:05:28] catch it.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; Just like just like just like when we
[1:05:33] take baptism. All right. Brother
[1:05:36] Brandham says if you can read
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; you can get baptism. All you got to do
[1:05:41] is read.
[1:05:42] He says concerning um concerning the
[1:05:46] original sin, he says it's so plain a
[1:05:50] 12-year-old child
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; could get it.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; But he says, "But when it comes to the
[1:05:57] Godhead, now you can learn and memorize
[1:06:01] the X's and O's and how we explain it.
[1:06:03] We have to be very careful. Use the
[1:06:05] correct language or it it'll it'll go in
[1:06:07] the weeds quickly and give you the wrong
[1:06:09] idea." And I love Brother Brandom. I
[1:06:11] just always go back to brother
[1:06:13] Brandham's simple explanation. It is so
[1:06:15] beautiful. And he says, you know, he
[1:06:17] like Solomon. Solomon was the son of
[1:06:19] David. He said, "But now Jesus wasn't
[1:06:22] exactly like Solomon." He said, "Because
[1:06:24] Solomon was just a man."
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; He says, "But Jesus was man plus the God
[1:06:31] man." Hallelujah. So, I love Brother
[1:06:35] Brad's simple uh Kentucky way of
[1:06:38] explaining things. So we find then that
[1:06:41] she lives in this invisible union. And
[1:06:45] so we know and we've already
[1:06:47] demonstrated to you in our previous
[1:06:49] lessons that God creates by that letter
[1:06:54] H.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; He renames by that letter H. He
[1:06:59] multiplies through that through that
[1:07:01] what? Through his word. See where' the H
[1:07:04] come from? From him. Who's he? The word.
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; All right. So, so then Abraham's
[1:07:10] transformation
[1:07:12] from Abram to Abraham, it would parallel
[1:07:15] perfectly the transformation
[1:07:18] uh by the word of the son of man. But
[1:07:21] you remember Jesus comes to them and he
[1:07:24] gives them a parable concerning the the
[1:07:28] swer of the seed. You remember that? And
[1:07:30] the and later on he doesn't explain it a
[1:07:33] whole lot. You know, one went and swed
[1:07:35] forth seed and up came wheat and then a
[1:07:38] enemy come in and swed behind him and up
[1:07:40] came tears and and and then the servants
[1:07:42] came, Lord, what shall we do? Would you
[1:07:44] would they we root them up? He said,
[1:07:46] "No, not so. Let them grow till the end
[1:07:49] to the harvest and I'll send forth my
[1:07:51] angels and they'll separate all this."
[1:07:52] See, so when they get Jesus back in
[1:07:56] private, they ask him, "Master, declare
[1:08:00] unto us the parable of the swers." And
[1:08:02] so Jesus makes it clear the field is the
[1:08:05] world. It was created by he
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; the field is the world. It was created
[1:08:11] by H. It and and it becomes and that
[1:08:16] place that I have created by my breath
[1:08:19] by he by the H in Elohim by that same
[1:08:24] word by that same word I have made it so
[1:08:28] that the place I create which is the
[1:08:31] world is where I will plant the new
[1:08:34] children of the kingdom and they're
[1:08:37] going to be sown here and raised here
[1:08:40] and they and the earth and me and my
[1:08:43] word and my name will all be the same
[1:08:46] thing.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; So, so we find then that divine speech
[1:08:53] plus divine seed equals divine sons and
[1:08:57] it spans all through the Old Testament
[1:08:59] and the New Testament. And that's why
[1:09:02] you have to have a revelation of the
[1:09:04] Godhead to really for it to really take
[1:09:07] a hold because the the only people who
[1:09:12] can receive that revelation
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; say those to whom the spirit will make
[1:09:16] it clear the only ones he can make it
[1:09:19] clear to by revelation are people who
[1:09:22] are made of the same substance. Amen.
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; So, there's no way for anyone who's not
[1:09:28] part of the Godhead to understand the
[1:09:31] Godhead because we can't even figure out
[1:09:34] all the X's and O's, but I know I'm part
[1:09:37] of something that didn't begin here. I
[1:09:40] know I didn't come into the earth like
[1:09:42] everybody else. I came with a purpose
[1:09:44] and God has given me a divine call and
[1:09:46] I've entered into an invisible union.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:52] So this is why brother Brandham when he
[1:09:54] would say in the future home this is a
[1:09:56] privilege you have
[1:09:58] see because remember the future home
[1:10:01] he's showing you remember he took in who
[1:10:03] is this mazdcin and Christ is the
[1:10:06] mystery god revealed and it's all god by
[1:10:07] expression god by people and there's we
[1:10:09] read all those powerful quotes for you
[1:10:11] that you were gene and your father and
[1:10:13] he goes on that in the last four sermons
[1:10:15] uh in the rapture and uh and in
[1:10:17] leadership and and uh and and uh two
[1:10:20] other ones escaped me. But but we find
[1:10:23] here in the future home late in ' 64,
[1:10:26] he's saying if he healed a man at any
[1:10:29] time through the journey of life, let it
[1:10:32] be in the days of Jesus, the apostles,
[1:10:34] the prophets, whenever it was when the
[1:10:36] same condition is met. Aren't you glad
[1:10:37] for that? He's got to do it again.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; So there's nothing you need to do to
[1:10:43] talk him into it. Just walk in the order
[1:10:46] of his word and when you get a problem,
[1:10:49] remind him of his promise.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Friends, divine healing is
[1:10:54] that simple. You don't have to jump up
[1:10:56] and down and run all over the place and
[1:10:58] make a big bunch of noise. You have to
[1:11:00] live your life in accordance with his
[1:11:02] word. And when you get a problem, and
[1:11:04] you will. When you get a problem, you
[1:11:06] say, "Lord, this is your promise. I'm
[1:11:08] claiming it right now. It's mine. It
[1:11:11] always was mine. It always will be mine.
[1:11:14] And there's no devils that can stop me
[1:11:17] from getting it.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; The only one that can really stop me is
[1:11:21] me.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; See, so he says, "Whatever it was, when
[1:11:28] the same condition is met, he's got to
[1:11:30] do it again." That's right. He doesn't
[1:11:32] change. Man changes. Time changes. The
[1:11:35] time changes, our changes, dispensation
[1:11:38] changes, but God remains the same. He is
[1:11:42] perfect. And brother Benham says, "What
[1:11:44] a hope that ought to give sick people."
[1:11:48] See, friends, that's the whole beauty of
[1:11:50] it. The if if if if any man or woman
[1:11:54] down through the scripture ever received
[1:11:57] the revelation from God starting with
[1:11:59] Abel who received it, he heard, he
[1:12:02] recognized, and he acted upon it. Then
[1:12:06] then what whatever God did for them, if
[1:12:08] you hear it and recognize it and act
[1:12:10] upon it, if you receive it and believe
[1:12:12] it and act upon it, then God has to do
[1:12:15] the same thing for you. Why do you think
[1:12:17] Why do you I mean, in Egypt, they've got
[1:12:19] a pyramid. And and what and they think
[1:12:22] they built that thing. What they don't
[1:12:24] know is is that was Enoch's church.
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; And they think they built it. They
[1:12:29] didn't build it. Enoch built that thing.
[1:12:31] That was his church. And he and he and
[1:12:33] the the the Bible in the stars match the
[1:12:35] Bible in the pyramid matches the Bible
[1:12:37] that we have. Oh, hallelujah. Now the
[1:12:40] Now the trick is to get this Bible to
[1:12:42] match this Bible.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; He's already given you a name change.
[1:12:46] He's already given you H into your name.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; What does hinder you, oh foolish
[1:12:51] Galatians? What does hinder you?
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; How did you ever turn it around to some
[1:12:56] man-made thing? This is the power of of
[1:12:59] Christ and his resurrection power that I
[1:13:01] may know him
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; and the power of his resurrection.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; I mean, listen, here's here's the real
[1:13:10] takeaway for me. Go to that pyramid.
[1:13:13] Many of you have been to that pyramid.
[1:13:15] Mike's been to that pyramid. JD, Matt's
[1:13:17] been to that pyramid. Anybody else been
[1:13:18] to that pyramid? Got three brothers in
[1:13:21] here. Brother Travis, you were there.
[1:13:22] That's right. Uh and the and the girls
[1:13:24] were there when y'all saw all that. Uh
[1:13:26] when y'all went to who? Israel, you
[1:13:29] didn't take your wives. What's the
[1:13:30] matter for you?
[1:13:34] Wow. I would have never Well, never
[1:13:36] mind.
[1:13:38] Oh, praise the Lord, Sister Deb. You got
[1:13:40] the best man in the building. I I don't
[1:13:43] know. She wouldn't go probably. Well,
[1:13:44] she might. Pyramids. No. Jerusalem. Yes.
[1:13:48] She's be like, I'll just see the
[1:13:49] pyramid. I'll just go meet Enoch and
[1:13:51] I'll ask him about it. I'm so glad to
[1:13:54] know I'm going to meet Enoch.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; The point I'm wanting to make is, yeah,
[1:13:59] his church is there, but there ain't no
[1:14:01] grave there.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; You Enoch's not buried there. Look all
[1:14:08] through, dig through the sand till
[1:14:09] kingdom come. You won't find a grave.
[1:14:12] You won't find his remains because he
[1:14:15] was changed in a moment and the
[1:14:17] twinkling of an eye.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Abraham's
[1:14:23] name change added creation power to the
[1:14:26] promise. Which means that because you
[1:14:29] are now Mrs. Jesus Christ, the power of
[1:14:32] creation is added into your promise.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; See, so that's how he'll get us all the
[1:14:38] way. I mean, creation power, I just say,
[1:14:40] my goodness, creation power, it already
[1:14:43] proved it can create something out of
[1:14:44] nothing. Are you standing on an earth?
[1:14:46] You're standing on an earth that came
[1:14:48] out out of nothing. He made all things
[1:14:50] from nothing that appears.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; See, so if that's the kind of power he
[1:14:54] has and that's and he he has put that in
[1:14:58] your possession and identified it. He
[1:15:01] put a marker there calling you Mrs.
[1:15:03] Jesus Christ like Abram made him
[1:15:06] Abraham. Sarai made her Sarah. He's
[1:15:08] doing the same thing again. And I just
[1:15:11] so appreciate that it took a prophet to
[1:15:13] realize that it came out of Elohim
[1:15:16] because because Elohim
[1:15:19] literally Elohim is the self-existing
[1:15:22] God. And as Abraham as I showed you in
[1:15:24] 20 what I say 21 and 22 and 23 maybe
[1:15:28] he's using that term. And so when he
[1:15:31] when there in 18 he calls him Yahweh or
[1:15:34] Jehovah. And then three I think two or
[1:15:37] three verses down he because he calls
[1:15:39] him Lord not lords Lord Yahweh Jehovah
[1:15:44] three or two or three verses down he
[1:15:46] says my Lord and that's Dona because now
[1:15:49] it's personal you're not just I already
[1:15:51] know who you are but I also know you're
[1:15:54] my Lord. I also know that I came out of
[1:15:57] your lineage.
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that's what kept him out
[1:16:01] of Sodom. That's what brought you out of
[1:16:03] Sodom. You no longer were satisfied with
[1:16:06] Sodom. You wanted to live among the
[1:16:08] king. Hallelujah.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; So, it's a it's the same resurrection
[1:16:15] creative power that works in the
[1:16:17] believer's body and it it shows that it
[1:16:21] will bring us from the grave and that
[1:16:23] the redemption of all creation is
[1:16:25] underway. The redemption of all
[1:16:28] creation.
[1:16:30] That's literally what the future home
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; message was all about. And nothing can
[1:16:37] stop it.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; That's right. Praise God.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; Nothing ever could stop it.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; See, friends, that's what we've been
[1:16:44] trying to get you to understand. There's
[1:16:46] not enough devils in hell.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; You're on the way to something.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; It's like I It's like I gave you that
[1:16:53] golfing. Got a number of brothers in
[1:16:55] here love golf. They always appreciate
[1:16:56] this, but everybody can can see it. Uh,
[1:16:59] and I don't remember which golf pro it
[1:17:01] was. Might have been Zeer. I don't
[1:17:02] remember. It was way back or Palmer, one
[1:17:04] of those guys. It might have been uh
[1:17:06] Jack because he had such a long drive
[1:17:08] and they were asking him, "How do you
[1:17:09] drive the ball that far off a te?" And
[1:17:12] man, he could just like send it to Alpha
[1:17:15] Centuri off the T-OT. And he said,
[1:17:18] "Well, it's I because I'm not trying to
[1:17:20] hit the ball.
[1:17:22] I'm trying to do a perfect swing and the
[1:17:24] ball's in the path."
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; And literally, he said, "The ball's in
[1:17:28] my way.
[1:17:29] He said, "I'm trying to commit a perfect
[1:17:31] swing, and the ball is in my way. It's
[1:17:34] in the path of the swing." So, I'm here
[1:17:36] to tell you something, friends. God is
[1:17:39] going to restore an earth, and he's
[1:17:41] going to restore an Eden, and he's going
[1:17:42] to bring a new heavens and the new
[1:17:44] earth, and you're going to be there cuz
[1:17:45] you're in the way.
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And on his way to that, he's
[1:17:49] taking you home. On his way to that,
[1:17:51] we're coming back together with Moses
[1:17:53] and Elijah together, 144,000. Uh because
[1:17:55] of that, we're all going to be in a
[1:17:57] millennium. Because of that, when Satan
[1:17:59] is loosed at the end of a thousand
[1:18:01] years, we're lifted up and fire and
[1:18:02] brimstone is rained down. And I saw a
[1:18:05] new heavens and a new earth. And you're
[1:18:07] going to be there. And that city of
[1:18:09] gigantic pearl is already hung. The
[1:18:12] gates are hung. The streets are ready.
[1:18:14] And those who built it stand in awe,
[1:18:16] waiting only for those to throng its
[1:18:19] streets for whom it was built.
[1:18:20] Hallelujah.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:18:26] So we find then that
[1:18:29] our life then becomes now let me turn
[1:18:32] for home God maybe I would say 15 16
[1:18:35] minutes you good
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; I want to get to this part it's on my
[1:18:40] heart I had two more parts I wanted to
[1:18:43] get to but I said to myself self when
[1:18:45] you get to this point look at the clock
[1:18:47] and you may only have time for one I got
[1:18:49] time for one
[1:18:52] there were times
[1:18:55] Um,
[1:18:57] and I I struggled even studying how to
[1:19:00] word this to make it sound sensitive
[1:19:03] enough, but not I'm not here to take a
[1:19:06] sermon like this where we're just
[1:19:09] rejoicing in the Lord and turn it dark
[1:19:11] on you.
[1:19:13] But there have been times in our lives
[1:19:18] where our environment
[1:19:21] uh for lack of a better way to say it
[1:19:23] didn't nurture our true nature.
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; And I'm talking about the one that Paul
[1:19:30] spoke about. We were all at one time by
[1:19:33] nature the children of wrath, but that's
[1:19:35] not our original nature. Our original
[1:19:37] nature, we've proved to you, came from
[1:19:39] God. That's the gene of God. As you were
[1:19:42] a gene in your earthly father, so you're
[1:19:43] a gene in your heavenly father. And
[1:19:45] that's that that's that deep calling to
[1:19:47] the deep. Called to that gene. And that
[1:19:49] gene responded. That that seed called
[1:19:51] out there must be more. There must be
[1:19:54] something more. And because it had that
[1:19:56] cry, the world doesn't cry that. They're
[1:19:59] when they say there must be something
[1:20:00] more, they're mostly referring to extra
[1:20:02] zeros in their checking account. Right?
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; When when they cry for something more,
[1:20:07] they want something material, something
[1:20:08] in the world, a higher education, a
[1:20:10] better career, better station in life,
[1:20:11] better position, more social media
[1:20:13] friends, all you know, but but to the
[1:20:15] but to the bride, somehow we have this
[1:20:18] strange almost inexplicable feeling that
[1:20:21] says, "I really don't care so much about
[1:20:23] that.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm crying for something more that's
[1:20:27] eternal,
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; not transient. Not here. It's gone here
[1:20:30] today. It's gone tomorrow. You be rich
[1:20:32] today and broke tomorrow.
[1:20:34] Multi-millionaires, billionaires who
[1:20:37] lose a bunch of money and and come down
[1:20:39] to just be millionaires jump out of 50
[1:20:41] story windows
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; because I'm broke. What do you mean? You
[1:20:44] still got $50 million in the bank. Yeah,
[1:20:46] but I used to have 3.6 billion. I'm
[1:20:48] broke. You're not broke. You're insane.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; So, so the the the God of this evil age
[1:20:57] has blinded your eyes.
[1:21:00] So, we get that that there we had a an
[1:21:03] original nature. I wasn't born with it,
[1:21:05] but I had it I was born with it dormant
[1:21:08] as a seed of God down inside of me. And
[1:21:11] so, there were times when we maybe I
[1:21:14] don't know, maybe the the way we were
[1:21:16] born, maybe we were born illicitly,
[1:21:18] maybe we were born in a family that
[1:21:20] wasn't godly. Brother Brandham was like
[1:21:21] that. His family was not religious at
[1:21:23] all, he said. And it put terrible
[1:21:26] strains in him. and he he he he hated
[1:21:29] women and he said they're not worth a
[1:21:31] good bullet to shoot them with. And
[1:21:32] that's a that's the mentality of a
[1:21:34] 14-year-old boy who's been raised in
[1:21:36] that kind of environment
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; of cheating and drinking and killing and
[1:21:40] cussing and everything is foul. And he's
[1:21:43] he knew that married women were at his
[1:21:45] house uh you know in fornication through
[1:21:47] the night going back home in the give
[1:21:49] them black coffee and get them back home
[1:21:51] before their husband comes in from his
[1:21:52] overnight shift. get him sober and
[1:21:54] saying be home cooking him breakfast.
[1:21:56] And brother Brandham said, "I hated
[1:21:58] that." He said, "Now the Holy Spirit
[1:22:00] took that from me." He said, "And now I
[1:22:01] realize that a godly woman is the
[1:22:03] greatest gift God can give a man outside
[1:22:05] of his salvation."
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; That she's a jewel in his crown. And and
[1:22:09] he and he talks about you treat her as a
[1:22:11] sweetheart and all these different
[1:22:12] things. So I'm I'm just saying all that
[1:22:14] to say again, sometimes environments
[1:22:17] didn't nurture our true nature.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; Wow. Maybe maybe former associates,
[1:22:24] maybe dare I say former churches, former
[1:22:27] pastors, former spouses. I hate to say
[1:22:29] it like that, but hey, this is the
[1:22:31] grabag of life,
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; you know, and and it happens. And and
[1:22:35] and and more than that, not only not
[1:22:38] only did it not nurture our true nature,
[1:22:41] but it actually fed our flesh nature.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; This is almost a double whammy. And I
[1:22:47] have heard I have heard over over almost
[1:22:50] 40 years of ministry. I have heard uh
[1:22:54] you know the the heartbreaking stories
[1:22:58] of those raised in those kinds of
[1:23:00] environments.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; And sometimes
[1:23:04] I have as you have today in a real uh
[1:23:08] turn of of let's just be honest. Let's
[1:23:10] be transparent today. And I'll just be
[1:23:13] transparent with you. Sometimes I have
[1:23:15] suffered deep regrets
[1:23:17] uh uh steering my own ship
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; into
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; situations that didn't nurture
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; my true nature but actually fed my
[1:23:27] fallen flesh.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; Or worse yet, you say it can be worse
[1:23:32] than that. Yeah. Worse yet, many times,
[1:23:35] come on, I'm going to say we. Sometimes,
[1:23:38] not only did we steer ourselves into
[1:23:39] those terrible harbors, but we refused
[1:23:42] to steer ourselves out of them, even
[1:23:45] though the captain was giving you the
[1:23:46] coordinates to get out.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; I think we have to come back to the
[1:23:58] oldfashioned stanza. It's not It really
[1:24:00] is not my brother or my sister, but it's
[1:24:04] me, oh Lord. Yeah.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; It really is not my parents or my
[1:24:09] pastor, my spouse or my children, my
[1:24:12] school or my job. It's me, oh Lord,
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; standing in the need of prayer.
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; I'm going to tell you something,
[1:24:20] friends. When you're willing to lead
[1:24:21] with that, something good can be
[1:24:23] accomplished.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; When you get down off your high horse
[1:24:26] and you'll lead with that and say, "It's
[1:24:28] not this one or that one. It's I was I'm
[1:24:30] not going to blame anyone no matter what
[1:24:31] happened because I did enough damage to
[1:24:33] myself. How am I going to blame them? I
[1:24:36] just know now I've got a choice to make
[1:24:38] and I can break a cycle and I can take
[1:24:40] the way of the of the despised few if I
[1:24:42] want to.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; And if you want to, I'm here to tell you
[1:24:46] there's a Holy Ghost who's here to give
[1:24:48] you and empower you with the ability to
[1:24:51] do that and break the cycles of bad
[1:24:54] family and bad planning and bad marriage
[1:24:56] and bad this and bad that. Oh, he can
[1:24:58] make you a brand new creation in Christ
[1:25:01] Jesus.
[1:25:03] Thank you, Lord.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; There's one above you with creative
[1:25:06] power. I don't ever want you to forget
[1:25:09] that today when you leave here and you
[1:25:11] say, "Well, you just don't know what
[1:25:13] happened to me." I don't know. I
[1:25:15] probably don't want to know. I certainly
[1:25:17] don't need to know. But here's what I do
[1:25:19] know. And here's what I'd like you to
[1:25:20] know. There's someone just above you
[1:25:23] with creative power.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. who, as brother Fred
[1:25:28] Mullen says, I want to tell everybody
[1:25:31] about somebody who can help anybody.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; Oh my. He created everything from
[1:25:38] nothing. Isaiah 59 says, "Behold, the
[1:25:42] Lord's hand is not shortened that it
[1:25:45] cannot save, neither his ear heavy that
[1:25:48] it cannot hear." I love the NLT version
[1:25:50] of that. Listen. It starts out with that
[1:25:52] big bold exclamation point. Listen, the
[1:25:55] Lord's arm is not too weak to save you,
[1:25:58] nor is it too deaf to hear your call.
[1:26:01] Can I just come to a conclusion today to
[1:26:03] say uh the Lord, the arm of the Lord is
[1:26:06] not too weak to save you. The arm of the
[1:26:10] Lord is not too weak to save your
[1:26:12] children. The arm of the Lord is not too
[1:26:14] weak to save your marriage. The arm of
[1:26:16] the Lord is not too weak to save your
[1:26:18] health. And he's not deaf. He can hear
[1:26:21] you.
[1:26:22] All you have to do is cry out to him and
[1:26:25] say, "Lord God, I'm not worth much, but
[1:26:27] somehow you love me while I was a
[1:26:30] sinner, and I want to give my whole
[1:26:32] life, my everything to you right now. My
[1:26:35] I dedicate everything to you." How many
[1:26:39] are willing to lead with that today?
[1:26:40] Stand to your feet with me. Raise up
[1:26:42] those hands in affirmation. Say, "Lord,
[1:26:45] I'm willing to surrender it all. I want
[1:26:47] your all everything in your word, Lord
[1:26:50] God. Today. I don't want to wait more
[1:26:53] years. I want to see it come today.
[1:26:59] Oh my.
[1:27:01] Brother Brandham talks about I love this
[1:27:03] statement.
[1:27:06] M sing that for me again. Li Elohim. It
[1:27:09] was so shocking that you were singing
[1:27:11] that.
[1:27:13] predestinated children.
[1:27:17] They recognize their true spiritual
[1:27:20] identity
[1:27:21] when they hear the authentic call of
[1:27:23] God.
[1:27:25] Here's how brother Brandham said it.
[1:27:28] And I know everyone in here
[1:27:31] can relate to this.
[1:27:34] He talks about a eagle trapped in a bar.
[1:27:37] How to get him to think he's a chicken.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; He's not. He's an eagle.
[1:27:42] Brother Ram says, "But one day his
[1:27:45] mammy, his mother eagle, his mammy flew
[1:27:49] over."
[1:27:51] You know why she flew over?
[1:27:54] Cuz she was looking for him.
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; I don't I don't know what barnyard you
[1:28:00] were in, what barard you were in. I
[1:28:05] don't know what house of ill fame you
[1:28:08] were in. But when he found you, he found
[1:28:11] you cuz he was looking for you.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; And I want you to recognize that today.
[1:28:16] Give that back to the devil. It doesn't
[1:28:19] matter how I was born. It doesn't matter
[1:28:20] what I came through, my raising my
[1:28:22] people, my job, my this. None of that
[1:28:25] matters. I'm choosing him. I'm choosing
[1:28:28] the one who can change it all and help
[1:28:30] me. The one who knows me, the one who
[1:28:32] came looking for me.
[1:28:36] One day his mommy flew over and she
[1:28:38] screamed. He recognized it. None of
[1:28:40] those other little chickens, they didn't
[1:28:42] even look up other than maybe to run.
[1:28:46] He recognized it. That sounded right.
[1:28:49] Why?
[1:28:51] He was a eagle to begin with.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; Here's Elijah. That's the way it is with
[1:29:00] the gospel or the word or the power of
[1:29:03] Jesus Christ. When a man has been
[1:29:06] predestinated to eternal life, he hears
[1:29:09] that true ring scream of God, nothing
[1:29:13] can keep him from it.
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; If an eagle flies over a barnyard,
[1:29:20] chickens scramble and run. What caused
[1:29:24] that little guy to not run, but to
[1:29:27] actually look up and try to talk to this
[1:29:30] great being? And somehow when she
[1:29:33] screamed out, "You're not a chicken. You
[1:29:36] don't belong there. You didn't start
[1:29:39] there. You came from me. Somebody took
[1:29:42] you. There was a devious trick played on
[1:29:45] you. You didn't start in that barnyard.
[1:29:47] I didn't start in this fallen world. I
[1:29:49] heard an eagle scream. You didn't start
[1:29:51] there. Just say that to yourself. I
[1:29:53] didn't start here. I got a creator above
[1:29:55] me saying, "Come up higher. Come up out
[1:29:58] of that. I've got a whole new life for
[1:30:01] you. A whole new world for you." Mama,
[1:30:04] that sounds good. What do I do? Just
[1:30:08] flop your wings, honey. Just flop your
[1:30:11] wings. He said he he tried to give it a
[1:30:14] big jump. He didn't get too far at
[1:30:16] first. That might be you. Say, "I've
[1:30:19] tried this, Brother Jason. And I didn't
[1:30:21] seem to get much higher than the post.
[1:30:22] That's about how high that eagle got.
[1:30:25] But he kept jumping. She said, "Just
[1:30:27] keep flopping." And finally, he made a
[1:30:29] leap and he caught a current and he
[1:30:31] flopped harder and up he went. Up he
[1:30:33] went. Up he went. You know the beauty of
[1:30:35] that? He never needed to go back there
[1:30:37] and peck around in manure again and live
[1:30:40] among the chickens. He was free.
[1:30:43] He now knew his new nature, his original
[1:30:46] nature, and none of the problems of life
[1:30:49] mattered anymore.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; He just gave them all to Jesus. I
[1:30:54] haven't suffered like he did. So, let me
[1:30:55] just give my little suffering over to
[1:30:57] him because now I'm free.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Friends, that's why
[1:31:03] we've been trying to tell you
[1:31:06] it isn't acquiring something foreign.
[1:31:08] Not to you, not to the believer. when
[1:31:10] you're born again of the spirit of God.
[1:31:12] That's why so many people don't
[1:31:13] understand it and never get it because
[1:31:14] it's just a foreign thing to them.
[1:31:17] But but but you haven't acquired when
[1:31:20] you acquire the Holy Ghost, you haven't
[1:31:22] acquired something foreign,
[1:31:25] but you have recognized
[1:31:28] something
[1:31:30] innate, intrinsic. Something is born
[1:31:33] down inside of you. It's a it's an
[1:31:35] inborn thing. And you know I it's
[1:31:39] hearing a call that that resonates to
[1:31:43] your deeper identity.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; I know we got identity as humans and
[1:31:48] South Carolinians or this one or that
[1:31:49] one the other one. We got all kinds of
[1:31:51] identity. You wives take the name of the
[1:31:53] husband. We got all kinds of different
[1:31:55] identity. But I'm hearing a call that
[1:31:58] goes beyond all of that. It resonates
[1:32:00] with a deeper identity. You know it's
[1:32:02] there. You know it's there. That's how
[1:32:03] you recognize the word of God.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. As I said to you some weeks ago,
[1:32:10] I if it's not in your heart, why didn't
[1:32:12] you stay where you were?
[1:32:15] Why didn't you stay a child of darkness?
[1:32:17] Why'd you repent? Why'd you come to the
[1:32:18] light? Why'd you come to Christ? See,
[1:32:21] the dissatisfaction I just want to make
[1:32:23] these closing comments. That okay?
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; The dissatisfaction
[1:32:30] that many feel with their worldly
[1:32:33] existence. Do you remember brother
[1:32:34] Brandham said we live in an age we
[1:32:36] seemingly are unfitted for.
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; And I just want to say to you today that
[1:32:41] you are probably a fish out of water on
[1:32:44] many levels. You've probably seen other
[1:32:48] people you grew up with, went to school
[1:32:50] with, whatever. They have probably went
[1:32:52] circles around you and maybe
[1:32:54] multi-millionaires and here you are just
[1:32:56] a believer struggling along. People you
[1:32:58] grew up with took advantage. You see,
[1:33:00] the the Bible says that that you know
[1:33:02] that that the devil is wiser than Daniel
[1:33:04] and that wisdom goes along with Cain's
[1:33:06] children.
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; God's people have always been simple.
[1:33:09] God has intelligent believers and he has
[1:33:12] wealthy believers. God knows how to do
[1:33:14] it. I'm just glad I'm glad he knows how
[1:33:15] to do it.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; When brother Brandham, you know, asked
[1:33:18] him, you know, he looked at or Roberts
[1:33:19] and Tommy Osborne and all those big
[1:33:22] universities and brother Brandham said,
[1:33:23] I'd be ashamed to have him come to my
[1:33:25] office. Think about that. Elijah, the
[1:33:27] greatest ministry since the days of
[1:33:29] Christ. And he said, "It'd be one little
[1:33:31] typewriter in the end of an old trailer
[1:33:33] typing, trying to get letters out and or
[1:33:36] Roberts with machines that never touch
[1:33:38] the letter and four million of them."
[1:33:40] And he he finally comes out feeling
[1:33:42] sorry for himself and he says, "Lord,
[1:33:44] what about me?"
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; The Lord just said, "Look up.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; Look up." I say to you today, friends,
[1:33:54] just look up. Your future is so bright.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; He said, I am your portion. And brother
[1:34:00] Brandham said, that's good enough for
[1:34:02] me, Lord. Oh, and sometimes you may feel
[1:34:06] dissatisfaction with your worldly
[1:34:08] existence. I want to want you to know
[1:34:10] it's not it's not a failure to adapt,
[1:34:15] but it's an evidence of another life
[1:34:18] living inside of your life. Amen.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; The world order is an environment.
[1:34:28] And I just borrowed Brother Bradam's
[1:34:30] statement and I just said the plain
[1:34:32] brass tax of it is is that the world
[1:34:35] order is an environment incompatible
[1:34:39] with my design. And I'm glad it's
[1:34:42] passing away.
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; I'm not chasing it. The feeling of not
[1:34:46] fitting in with the world.
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:50] It isn't because there's something wrong
[1:34:54] with you.
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; It's actually because you were made for
[1:34:57] something higher.
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; There's nothing wrong with you. You were
[1:35:03] made for something higher.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. It's not because you're
[1:35:09] failing. It's because God made you for
[1:35:14] something better and your true nature
[1:35:17] knows it.
[1:35:21] Oh l
[1:35:24] take it over son.
[1:35:27] [Music]
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; How I long
[1:35:32] to worship
[1:35:35] you.
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; Oh,

[1:35:43] him.

[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; It's a dark hour, friends.
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; Satan comes
[1:36:04] to bring us down.
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; You identify with that. But with your
[1:36:11] spirit,
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; your spirit
[1:36:14] before us.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; Do you recognize his presence
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; and righteousness
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; and righteousness
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; going to rise
[1:36:23] and sing?
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:36:29] [Music]
[1:36:32] hallelujah.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; How we long
[1:36:36] to worship
[1:36:38] you. Oh yes God.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; Oh

[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; Give us another verse brother.

[1:37:02] in worship.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; Now look at that line. No matter
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; no matter what.

[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; what the circumstance.
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; No matter
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; no matter what.
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; How many got situations?
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; Say, "Man, Lord, I got a situation." No
[1:37:20] matter.
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; Lord, we lift.
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; I lift up holy hands.
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; I know he's got this.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; Who does?
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; Oh, and
[1:37:32] hallelujah. Oh.

[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; Elohim.
[1:37:50] [Applause]
[1:37:52] How we long. We got another verse to
[1:37:55] worship
[1:37:57] you. Come on. Let's sing that again.
[1:38:00] Here we are
[1:38:02] in Satan's
[1:38:05] Eden.

[1:38:18] here
[1:38:20] before us

[1:39:05] Matt. Hallelujah. Before we go, let's
[1:39:07] worship him, friends.
