[0:00] and that's
[0:02] because um I was born in Mexico
[0:07] City a long time
[0:09] ago and eventually I was the first of 10
[0:14] children and so um
[0:17] my um parents were Baptist
[0:21] missionaries and my four brothers are
[0:23] Baptist preachers so my youngest brother
[0:27] built a nice Church in Flagstaff last
[0:30] two years and so the eight remaining
[0:33] siblings all showed up for the
[0:34] dedication so I was out
[0:37] there but uh I was asked if I spoke
[0:40] Spanish yes I'm bilingual I was raised
[0:42] in
[0:44] Mexico um and so we're glad that we can
[0:50] be here with you and we could speak all
[0:54] night and maybe not touch on the um
[0:58] subject that is bothering you or the
[1:00] that the question that you might have
[1:04] so um if you have any questions we
[1:07] thinking about them and we will do our
[1:10] best
[1:12] to uh answer the question to where it
[1:17] would be something you could understand
[1:19] we're not going to preach we'll do that
[1:21] on
[1:23] Sunday and I know that you have a good
[1:25] preacher here so I'm struggling to see
[1:27] what I can say that hasn't been said
[1:30] or that might make sense but just like
[1:33] with brother Matt and his dad well of
[1:35] course our good friend Brad here JD um
[1:40] everybody's got their own angle at the
[1:42] word my purpose in the ministry is to
[1:46] like brother Bram says make Christ real
[1:48] to the
[1:49] people we can all go and see what
[1:51] brother Bram said about whatever subject
[1:54] and we've spent our life translating
[1:55] into Spanish and producing other books
[1:58] to help people you know
[2:00] but um my first question would be who
[2:04] all here is actually married besides
[2:06] Brad what yeah JD your wife's not
[2:11] here anybody else
[2:14] married oh yeah man are you kind of
[2:17] getting
[2:18] close getting close are you committed
[2:23] yeah oh real
[2:26] close uh
[2:28] committ
[2:30] okay well so we're basically dealing
[2:33] with people that are headed towards
[2:36] marriage and um the only thing I can
[2:38] tell you is wait until the right person
[2:41] comes along even if you're 30 it doesn't
[2:44] matter because there's worse things in
[2:47] going through life single yeah believe
[2:50] me you don't have to look very far you
[2:53] believe
[2:55] that to prove the
[2:58] point but um
[3:00] so what what things are on your mind
[3:04] things that um you need help with or
[3:08] we're not talking Doctrine we're talking
[3:10] just simply your everyday stuff and
[3:13] stuff you might not understand in the
[3:15] message even though you've been here for
[3:16] several
[3:17] years um and we'll start with Brad I'm
[3:21] sure he's got at least one
[3:25] question asking questions yeah
[3:31] Sarah does he have a
[3:35] question yes please do I heard I think I
[3:39] don't remember which brother's ttim
[3:42] Brandon was a bit of a
[3:44] prankster he had a great sense of humor
[3:48] yes and then when people played tricks
[3:50] on him he was real cool about it too
[3:55] like he was going down the street one
[3:56] day in a station wagon and so one of his
[4:01] you know young men are riding along with
[4:03] him and so here comes this pretty girl
[4:06] you know walking down the street so when
[4:08] they get close this guy reaches over and
[4:10] honks the horn and he Ducks down the
[4:12] only one they can see is
[4:16] from yeah he uh he was uh he had a real
[4:20] sense of
[4:21] humor
[4:23] Y what
[4:25] else how did you meet your wife I met my
[4:29] wife
[4:30] because I okay my mother was born and
[4:34] raised in Tucson
[4:35] Arizona and so when I got up to the 10th
[4:39] grade they sent me from Mexico to live
[4:43] with my grandfather in
[4:45] Arizona and so I'm in this
[4:47] school of 25 200 kids big school and we
[4:53] um uh I developed the attitude I I was
[4:57] the Oddball I didn't dance didn't go to
[5:00] the parties didn't smoke didn't drink
[5:02] all that so they knew I was kind of
[5:04] strange and I was just a born again
[5:06] Christian the Baptist Church you know
[5:09] well so then one day this girl comes up
[5:11] to me she's I barely knew who she was
[5:14] and she says now we know you're you're
[5:16] kind of you know
[5:18] picky but um we know just the girl for
[5:22] you well Rebecca apparently had been
[5:24] there a couple weeks more and I didn't
[5:28] know she wasn't into my class es so they
[5:31] um she said well uh her name is Rebecca
[5:34] yeah where is she she way over there
[5:36] getting on the bus so the next day I met
[5:38] Rebecca brandham and sure enough most
[5:40] beautiful girl I'd ever seen and
[5:43] especially with that southern accent you
[5:45] know out in Arizona and so um but then
[5:49] had to meet her dad well I never heard
[5:51] that name before so it didn't didn't
[5:54] register you know and all she said my
[5:56] dad's a preacher you got to talk to him
[5:59] so as it turns out they they had an
[6:03] apartment they rented uh for the about
[6:07] three years anyway they they landed they
[6:10] rent into an apartment and it was like a
[6:11] block from my house wow predestination
[6:14] you know didn't have to go shopping
[6:16] didn't have to spend a bunch of money or
[6:18] anything and so I go and talk to the man
[6:21] and here he was in the backyard with no
[6:24] shirt on you know messing with the
[6:26] plants and stuff and so she introduces
[6:29] me and then
[6:30] disappeared and here I'm talking to well
[6:32] I never heard never heard that name
[6:33] didn't know anything about Ministry at
[6:35] all so we just talked and so maybe 15 20
[6:39] minutes and he
[6:42] um
[6:44] uh I forget what questions he asked I
[6:47] don't remember any of that but we were
[6:48] just talking and so he um he gave me
[6:52] permission I could I could date her well
[6:55] I had the victory but he had the problem
[6:58] because there were some other guys
[7:00] that kind of waiting their turn but
[7:02] game's over you
[7:04] know so he had to announce that publicly
[7:07] kid here my girl's going with um and
[7:11] that's how I met her and we we finished
[7:14] um uh that was the middle of the 11th
[7:16] year so we had a year and a half school
[7:18] together we graduated together in May of
[7:24] 1964 that was when the first Mustangs
[7:27] came out 6 four to have so do that
[7:32] answer your
[7:37] question you two are pretty quiet over
[7:39] there Sur you're thinking of
[7:44] something more
[7:47] nervous was oh I was already in by
[7:51] then but I was I tried to be careful
[7:54] because I know you could see through me
[7:57] so there was no telling any stories or
[7:59] anything you
[8:00] know and so we uh we couldn't have any
[8:03] dates during the week cuz you know we're
[8:05] at school and then uh really the only
[8:08] time we had a date was probably Friday
[8:10] night because Saturday night had to get
[8:12] ready for church and everything and so
[8:14] they lived in this duplex
[8:16] apartment and so you know we'd walk up
[8:19] to the door and here you know saying
[8:21] good night and everything all of a
[8:23] sudden this light comes on right about
[8:24] six and a half feet you know porch light
[8:27] and um kind of bothersome you know so
[8:32] light comes on little hand comes out I
[8:35] put a quarter in the hand hand goes back
[8:37] light goes off real
[8:41] simple and I know whose hand it was so
[8:44] that was my brother-in-law's earliest
[8:46] experiences in separating Believers from
[8:48] their
[8:52] cash and when he heard me tell the story
[8:56] you know he's had got to have a comeback
[8:58] and he said you wasn't even a believer
[9:00] at the time I said well your your dad
[9:03] thought
[9:05] so the
[9:10] story yeah it was um quite an
[9:16] experience did you ever get in trouble
[9:18] with
[9:19] what uh yeah there was once or twice and
[9:22] I should have you know zipped
[9:27] it but uh he was very kind they let it
[9:30] go you
[9:34] know whatever you did must been B enough
[9:39] that the what I said whatever you did
[9:41] must been bad enough not repeat yeah it
[9:44] was you know it's not
[9:47] necessary yeah I know if you're in it
[9:50] with Brad
[9:53] I take it all into
[9:55] consideration if he's the hero here I'll
[9:59] I'll blame for
[10:06] yeah well um as I you know spent more
[10:10] time around him and he didn't give me a
[10:14] bunch of tapes or anything to listen to
[10:15] he just accepted me for what I was
[10:17] because he could see that I was a
[10:19] Christian mean he tells that story on
[10:21] one of the questions that answers in
[10:23] August of 64 says that she was you
[10:27] know playing the wrong of music and all
[10:30] this business and and um he said but
[10:33] then she met George he's a Christian and
[10:35] it the problem well I was taken to the
[10:37] Baptist church every Sunday so because
[10:40] there was no church in Tucson at the
[10:42] time and so uh as I learned more about
[10:46] him and wow it's right here in the Bible
[10:49] and there was no books back then there
[10:50] was just a life story book and Prophet
[10:53] South Africa um I realized that this is
[10:57] real and you know it's worth
[10:59] investing in a whole life so I think it
[11:02] was in July of
[11:03] 64 that I wrote a letter to the Baptist
[11:06] Church told him take my name off you
[11:08] know not coming
[11:10] back but um whole thing about the
[11:13] message it's scriptural see it's not
[11:15] just another idea like the Catholics at
[11:17] their idea they're all in this thing
[11:20] together they all have the same Bible we
[11:22] have but they they they have the same
[11:25] basic Doctrine they got a few little
[11:27] differences now this is this is life
[11:29] this is re reality and it's right there
[11:32] in scripture so once you see William
[11:34] brandom in the scripture well then
[11:36] there's no choice sck with it you know
[11:40] and um so I tell people today that what
[11:43] you have to
[11:44] do if a person says I believe the Bible
[11:47] well then let's look in here there's
[11:49] places where God uses the spirit of
[11:51] Elijah five times oh never saw that
[11:54] before well then once you see that well
[11:57] then what do you have to say well then
[11:59] can testify but um now the Baptist
[12:03] Church they they uh thought I was crazy
[12:06] and you know I was the first of 10
[12:08] children so I was supposed to you know
[12:09] follow in the footsteps and I didn't so
[12:13] they always had respect for brother Adam
[12:14] they didn't never they never say
[12:15] anything bad about him they just didn't
[12:18] understand you
[12:24] know question what would you say all the
[12:47] things outside of that in his
[12:57] character
[13:02] well that he had a lot of Grace he
[13:05] didn't jump to
[13:06] conclusions see like when when they
[13:09] moved to
[13:10] Arizona um it was because of a vision
[13:14] didn't have didn't ask for permission
[13:16] you know and they didn't know how long
[13:17] they would stay they get their clothes
[13:19] go west because they were going to tear
[13:21] up the driveway and okay so in reality
[13:24] you're thinking well as soon as I get
[13:26] the driveway fix we'll move back but
[13:28] anyway so out west with their just their
[13:31] clothes well at that point Rebecca had
[13:33] been with the same kids from the first
[13:35] grade and here she was in the middle of
[13:37] the 11th grade bad time to move she had
[13:41] had already like almost 10 years of
[13:43] classical
[13:45] piano piano at the house every day no
[13:48] piano out west um it was radically
[13:51] different no trees no church no friends
[13:54] but anyway so the girl at the
[13:56] corner uh her mother was a a piano
[13:59] teacher she had a grand piano well
[14:01] that's she gravitated there so um that's
[14:05] the girl that introduced us you know but
[14:07] um so one day brother R was getting
[14:09] family ready for supper going going out
[14:11] to eat there's only three kids okay
[14:13] there's only two where's Rebecca well
[14:15] she's at the corner we'll pick her up on
[14:17] the way so when he stops to go up to the
[14:20] door he's not hearing chopan or bethoven
[14:23] or down at the cross it's rock and roll
[14:27] because this other girl is just yeah
[14:29] yeah 20 20 fingers on one piano two
[14:32] girls you know and so he's about to lose
[14:36] it J so he knocks on the door and
[14:40] miraculously they heard she comes to the
[14:42] door he didn't jerk his belt off for
[14:44] nothing he said it's time to go so we go
[14:48] and she didn't hear another word about
[14:49] it for two months course the parents are
[14:52] praying and then as he tells the story
[14:54] there in ' 64 that um then she met me
[14:57] and I was taking her to church and and
[15:00] end of that problem you know wow yeah
[15:03] real simple but at the time looked like
[15:05] the end of the world so he was a lot of
[15:08] Grace and he knew when people were
[15:12] telling him the truth and when they
[15:13] weren't but he he was real cool and you
[15:17] could treat him all the same you know
[15:19] and you'd think that was his best friend
[15:21] but it was causing him the most
[15:23] problem you
[15:25] know
[15:27] yeah
[15:34] what about that
[15:42] one well
[15:44] Bert yeah I never met him
[15:47] okay but see there's an example here's a
[15:50] just a worldly guy he was a good shot he
[15:53] was a good Hunter somehow they teamed
[15:56] up and also uh like the Dr adir he talks
[15:59] about Sam adir in Jeffersonville well
[16:02] see brother br's neighbor was Mrs May
[16:06] well Mrs May was a nurse at the hospital
[16:09] and when she found out that the Reverend
[16:11] Brandon next door and Dr adir were close
[16:13] friends she couldn't just couldn't
[16:16] fathom that because Adar had a bad bad
[16:19] mouth he was just bad but somehow they
[16:22] were close friends you
[16:24] know so he uh he didn't judge people he
[16:29] was just
[16:30] kind now he knew how to stay away from
[16:33] people that are really bad but um yeah
[16:37] that that guy actually became a
[16:39] Christian and and became a deacon and
[16:41] Baptist Church I think brother B tells
[16:43] that part yeah
[16:46] so what
[16:49] else years ago you told a story about
[16:52] don't remember the details something to
[16:53] do with
[16:56] Cadillac driving it
[17:03] well okay first of all back in the 60s
[17:07] Cadillac was just the ultimate car
[17:10] European cars had come over here very
[17:12] much so the Christian businessman which
[17:15] is a big organization wanted to buy him
[17:18] a nice car they were buying other people
[17:20] Cadillacs they want to buy him a
[17:21] Cadillac nope no Cadillac so um finally
[17:27] um brother Mar bright you've heard that
[17:29] name he was the treasurer of the
[17:32] organization and he got a new car every
[17:34] year so
[17:36] in like October or November
[17:39] of
[17:40] 55 he was getting delivery on his new 56
[17:44] Cadillac so he got the keys to the 55
[17:47] and gave it to these two guys you drive
[17:49] this to Jeffersonville just park it give
[17:51] him the keys don't talk to nobody just
[17:52] leave it there also brother RM comes
[17:55] home wow where' this come from this it's
[17:57] a huge car it's like from here to the
[17:59] next room you know and um big four-door
[18:03] had had a I think the engine was like
[18:06] 500 horsepower had two four barrel
[18:10] carburetors I mean it was nice it had
[18:13] air conditioning real nice air okay so
[18:16] he puts it in the garage and um wasn't
[18:20] going to drive it deal with this later
[18:22] so after several months he puts a little
[18:24] disclaimer in the newspaper said that um
[18:27] I'm going to be driving this blue and
[18:28] white car I didn't buy it with your
[18:30] money somebody gave it to me and
[18:31] explained it all so when they went to
[18:34] Arizona they drove that also okay so
[18:37] they they have it out there well so
[18:39] sometimes he would say hey why don't you
[18:41] take my car tonight well I was young but
[18:43] I wasn't stupid you know that's great
[18:45] idea
[18:47] but my Ford truck I could put the
[18:51] regular gas in it which was 22 cents a
[18:53] gallon MH but his car needed the premium
[18:58] that was 36 Cents a gallon so and there
[19:01] was no self- pump you had to pull up and
[19:03] let the guy do it you know so we we'd
[19:05] drive that sometimes and we'd pull up
[19:06] and get $3 worth of
[19:09] gasoline and so one day we're coming
[19:12] home from school driving this
[19:15] Cadillac and Rebecca lived a block this
[19:18] way and I lived a block down that way
[19:20] and so as we we're you know negotiating
[19:23] the turn I looked down there to see if
[19:25] anybody was at my house well I cut it
[19:28] too short and right behind the front
[19:31] tire it caught this fire
[19:34] hydrant
[19:37] Crunch and so oh now what are I'm going
[19:39] to do so of course he saw it and he
[19:42] wouldn't let me pay for it they fixed it
[19:43] for like $50 he wouldn't let me pay for
[19:45] it and you know there was that where
[19:47] that where we hit that thing it was
[19:49] always greener there but I guess it
[19:52] busted something wasn't wasn't a real
[19:55] big hit but anyway it was always Greener
[19:58] right around that thing when I was out
[20:00] there last week I looked and sure enough
[20:01] they already removed it so this channel
[20:05] it some other way but um yeah that's the
[20:08] story about the about the
[20:14] Cadillac I don't be thinking of a
[20:16] question for Sunday because we're not
[20:18] going to have questions and answers on
[20:20] Sunday but we will start on time and I
[20:23] want you all to be there and show people
[20:26] that it's possible
[20:33] well just what's on tape he never said
[20:35] more than that and um he never that I
[20:39] remember he never mentioned the fact
[20:41] that his trainer was named George
[20:43] Smith but that's part of his story Smith
[20:47] yeah 6 second
[20:48] Smith but that was way back when he was
[20:50] you know 18 19 years old
[20:53] 20 what's your best
[20:56] memory well there's a lot of them um
[20:59] we've mentioned a few things best memory
[21:01] would probably be when I was praying
[21:04] with some brothers for the Holy Ghost
[21:07] and and he called about then because I
[21:10] was in Texas and he was in
[21:11] Arizona and um and as we were
[21:15] praying we're just three guys praying
[21:17] you know and I in my mind I could see
[21:20] like a cloudy sky with uh openings where
[21:23] you know rays of Sun come down through
[21:25] the clouds and um and one of those
[21:29] raises coming to me I guess and so about
[21:31] then he called for those other brothers
[21:33] he was calling them they'd been waiting
[21:35] for the call but he said first let me
[21:37] talk to George okay so I greeted him and
[21:40] he said I want to be first to
[21:41] congratulate you on receiving the Holy
[21:43] Ghost so that was always pretty special
[21:46] wow
[21:47] yeah and so all these years later not so
[21:50] much that he said it but that something
[21:53] really happened and it got bigger every
[21:54] day but it's a real vindication
[22:04] any
[22:05] what me no other people have dreams and
[22:09] tell me about it but I I was in it maybe
[22:13] um the other day this brother called me
[22:15] and he said um that he was like a fly on
[22:18] the wall because he could see brother
[22:19] Brand's living room and he said that um
[22:24] sister Brandon was in one chair and
[22:25] brother Neville was in another chair and
[22:28] me and Rebecca were sitting by the
[22:29] fireplace and so we're just talking so
[22:33] directly brother Neville gets up to
[22:34] leave and sister Brandon sees him to the
[22:38] door and so they're over there by the
[22:40] door and they said to Rebecca hey come
[22:42] here well I have one right here um
[22:45] brother Neville died in
[22:47] 74 and sister R died in 81 and Rebecca
[22:52] died in 06 so you know they're in one
[22:55] category I'm still sitting by the
[22:57] fireplace and so they look back at me in
[22:59] the dream and they said you keep doing
[23:01] what you're doing so that's why I'm here
[23:04] tonight still doing what I'm
[23:07] doing so there's been things like that
[23:10] but not what I dreamed my dreams don't
[23:13] last over 10 minutes when I wake up it's
[23:16] all
[23:18] gone I heard it's really really rare
[23:23] to well I don't know it's depends what
[23:27] God wants show
[23:29] you
[23:35] sister well she was very very German
[23:38] everything had to be in order yeah she
[23:41] couldn't go to bed at night if there was
[23:43] a dirty sock some place everything had
[23:44] to be
[23:51] done yeah there was I don't know what
[23:53] percentage but anyway she she was like
[23:55] that and the thing is they were raised
[23:57] very poor when she was young uh she said
[24:00] that come to the end of the month they
[24:02] were moving because you know Ren St okay
[24:04] forget this get your mattress and take
[24:06] off and so uh to her anything that's
[24:10] that's old is
[24:12] trash if we're not using it that'll hear
[24:15] it very
[24:16] practical
[24:20] yeah have a question
[24:25] um brother different people speak about
[24:28] how there was always people at their
[24:30] house all the time um so in or in my
[24:34] mind a lot of times I think people
[24:35] sitting out the yard or on the porch or
[24:38] just around the house the phone going
[24:40] off every few minutes and was it like
[24:42] that or was in my
[24:45] imagination no he tells uh something
[24:48] like that that phone's ringing all the
[24:50] time cuz it was a black phone on the
[24:53] wall with a dial had in cell phones and
[24:56] people would call and they wanted to
[24:58] talk to him and so there would be uh
[25:01] Rebecca says she'd come out to go to
[25:03] school and there's people laid on the on
[25:05] the porch you know so the the kids on
[25:08] the bus they're asking how come all
[25:11] these weird people well she said people
[25:15] love my dad so
[25:17] much and of course then she'd tell him
[25:19] about that he's going he just went over
[25:21] and prayed for King George you know in
[25:23] England so they'd make fun of that and
[25:26] so so oh is your dad still going to go
[25:29] you go pray for him no he's healed he
[25:31] not going back there so she was always
[25:33] on top of it you know wow but yeah there
[25:35] were people they would come and and he
[25:38] didn't have Yard Service he'd cut his
[25:39] own grass with you know power more but
[25:43] you had push it right and so he uh
[25:46] there's a picture I think inh one of the
[25:48] books where he's got this white coat on
[25:52] well it's August in
[25:54] Jeffersonville miserable so he was out
[25:57] there they cut the grass with no shirt
[25:59] on and and these people drove up they
[26:02] needed prayer so he ducked into the
[26:04] garage and got this raincoat on plastic
[26:07] raincoat and he goes and prays for him
[26:10] and they took pictures and so yeah a lot
[26:12] of that kind of stuff eventually they
[26:14] put a sign in the yard you need
[26:16] attention call this number and you know
[26:19] get on the list but yeah people just
[26:21] show up and if you had a you know sick
[26:24] child that's probably where you'd go you
[26:26] know
[26:28] I just can't
[26:29] imagine being a
[26:32] wife trying to keep my household
[26:34] together and keep things running and go
[26:36] people always being in my house and
[26:38] being on my porch and waking up and
[26:40] finding people in the yard and I just
[26:42] can't fathom that that would make me a
[26:44] nervous right okay see first of all they
[26:46] didn't have a nice house like this yeah
[26:49] two bedrooms one bath right so people in
[26:53] particular would come and maybe spend a
[26:56] week oh wow so somebody had to vacate
[27:00] the room right and the one bathroom and
[27:03] so here's sister brand trying to fix
[27:05] breakfast so she's trying to get the
[27:07] bacon out you know to get it on the to
[27:10] the paper towel and somebody grabs
[27:14] it how much that would you put up with
[27:16] oh my good I would probably be sitting
[27:19] in the corner crying yeah she had a
[27:21] tough
[27:26] life
[27:28] brother mom to be husband
[27:32] somebody oh there was it was the whole
[27:34] story out it was a miracle that we have
[27:38] a message that makes sense and it's
[27:41] clear and you know just a lot of things
[27:44] uh he was the thing is his family the
[27:49] ones before him they were all drunks and
[27:51] characters you know her people were too
[27:54] and so he was the one that made the
[27:57] difference
[28:02] yeah
[28:09] like something he did that I didn't
[28:12] like is that what you
[28:14] mean
[28:16] brother
[28:20] yes something like that well he he had a
[28:24] limit to his you know patience a lot of
[28:26] times
[28:27] but um yeah he he didn't like to see
[28:32] boys acting like girls that was really
[28:34] one of his pet
[28:37] peeps men like act like men so see the
[28:41] Lord knew when to take him because if he
[28:43] was to live
[28:46] today he'd go to the woods never come
[28:49] back he open the C would
[28:53] yeah what about
[28:56] sister
[29:00] uh they got along very well she was the
[29:02] one that most reflected his character
[29:06] wow yeah she was the firstborn you know
[29:10] and he would take her huntting or
[29:12] whatever so they got along real well
[29:15] yeah she was
[29:17] nature a lot like him
[29:22] yeah whatever happened to
[29:25] Sarah I don't know if you you find her
[29:27] let me know oh wow she married a
[29:32] basically a
[29:33] unbeliever
[29:36] and I always wonder never no no she's
[29:40] out there
[29:43] someplace well right she doesn't want to
[29:46] be found but see Billy died on the 19th
[29:48] of October and so she knew about it so
[29:52] she must be over there someplace so her
[29:54] friend called one of the relatives asked
[29:57] if she could come to the funeral well
[29:59] sure well she didn't show up so she
[30:02] doesn't want to get around us because
[30:05] she have to answer a lot of
[30:07] questions so
[30:09] better it's very
[30:14] sad in the services what stands out what
[30:17] stands out to you the
[30:23] most well the fact that he could be
[30:26] involed D with so many different people
[30:29] and yet come out there like cool as
[30:32] cucumber good evening friends and you
[30:35] know the way he gets started you know
[30:37] and spirit's all
[30:39] settled uh the Miracles were fantastic
[30:42] but the the preaching of the words that
[30:45] stick with what's written not inventing
[30:48] stuff and could have been and it was it
[30:51] was very um very
[30:56] refreshing
[31:05] oh this
[31:06] is the prophet of our age I don't know
[31:09] when that was but it was somewhere in
[31:11] the first year yeah because it's it's
[31:14] all Bible you know if it was Harry
[31:17] chrishna or something that you know was
[31:19] patched on or even the Mormons no this
[31:21] this is scripture and he was very
[31:24] careful that it would be scripture
[31:33] yeah got to be personal to each person
[31:36] and you're not going without the Holy
[31:39] Ghost
[31:43] so funniest
[31:45] memory well let's see funniest
[31:48] memory
[31:50] um I don't know
[31:54] um I don't think about that but he's
[31:56] he's a real jokester you know oh he
[31:59] could pull some fast ones
[32:02] and but uh he was just very very normal
[32:07] but see like he would see a
[32:09] situation and then Sunday he's preaching
[32:12] and he's comes from way over here
[32:13] someplace and telling this story about
[32:16] three days later you realize oh that's
[32:18] me in that
[32:22] story
[32:23] [Music]
[32:26] yeah
[32:28] I bet that
[32:33] embar up in their seat and hid under the
[32:36] pews yeah so his brother Jason preached
[32:40] about you a lot
[32:42] occasion you give him reason
[32:53] toor what question oh
[32:59] he
[33:03] thinking did you get
[33:07] involved very good question after I was
[33:11] baptized on the second day of
[33:14] August 65 then we got in the station
[33:17] wagon and we went to
[33:18] Tucson and so by then I um I've been out
[33:24] of school for a year you I had baptism
[33:27] right and I had the girl under contract
[33:30] cuz she had the ring and I had a car so
[33:33] I'm kind of making progress so we're
[33:35] driving around in my car and uh brother
[33:39] Ram says now if you ever get a chance to
[33:41] go to Israel your Bible will be a new
[33:43] book well that kind of went over because
[33:47] I wasn't thinking about Israel thinking
[33:48] about the girl you know and so um we
[33:54] um I don't know 1970s three we made our
[33:58] first trip and uh sure enough it's so
[34:03] small it's right there and so then in 84
[34:07] we took our first
[34:08] group and this past
[34:11] June uh was group number
[34:14] 48 so and it might be the last because
[34:18] there war and there's no
[34:20] tourism yeah yeah that's how I got
[34:24] started so I don't know how much of it
[34:26] he saw he didn't say any more about
[34:38] it well he didn't just yeah no I know he
[34:42] he he would carry on and he might get
[34:45] quiet or he might go in the other room
[34:47] you know but
[34:49] um he those Visions it might take a
[34:52] minute now the way he tells it B old
[34:55] long story it's like a dream you know
[34:58] really when you dream that that could be
[35:01] two minutes worth but you see all these
[35:03] details you know and that's the same
[35:06] with him um you wouldn't know it
[35:11] yeah and he didn't tell all that he knew
[35:14] either
[35:18] so but the main thing is stick with the
[35:22] scripture because like it says in
[35:23] Galatians 1:8 that you know Paul had
[35:27] been there he had baptized some of these
[35:28] people now he comes back and already
[35:31] these strange people came through you
[35:33] got to do this you got to do that he
[35:35] said look I preached under inspiration
[35:37] you know here's a revelation if I come
[35:39] back or Silas or if you know our big
[35:43] friend here or whoever comes over and
[35:46] says something
[35:48] different going down to stick with the
[35:52] original and that was what was great
[35:54] about brother BR is he he preached
[35:56] scripture he he had the same story all
[35:58] the way through he didn't change
[36:14] it it's on some
[36:19] tapes well yeah they they uh the people
[36:23] making the tape okay uh sometimes they
[36:26] would turn the volume down but most of
[36:28] the time he would just be quiet well
[36:30] maybe it's something we need to know
[36:31] right now uh but that's why he had to
[36:34] put in the church or okay that's all
[36:36] good but while I'm preaching you know we
[36:39] don't do that before do it after uh but
[36:43] he preached everywhere so a lot of
[36:44] people didn't pay attention to
[36:47] that now they they could have made
[36:50] better tapes uh we won't get into that
[36:53] ancient history now but yeah
[36:59] brother
[37:04] George your
[37:08] memory talking
[37:23] about this is my d
[37:27] he brother George speak to the condition
[37:30] things were From perspective during the
[37:33] trying
[37:34] time Gap
[37:43] also well the family
[37:48] um didn't see him when he was out like
[37:51] that he was gone they were at the house
[37:53] you know but he was a very high strung
[37:57] person and he had just had enough me
[38:02] here he is seeing all these Visions all
[38:05] these Miracles all these people been
[38:06] healed but people were coming for the
[38:09] for the fish fishes and Loaves they
[38:11] weren't catching what he was
[38:13] saying and so he human he'd had enough
[38:18] man I wish I could just go out and do
[38:19] that forget all this but of course God
[38:23] wouldn't let him you know I mean I've
[38:26] felt that way himself I went on vacation
[38:28] for the first time this past July I
[38:32] think it
[38:33] was and I'd always wanted to go on one
[38:35] those flat boats in Europe you know go
[38:38] down the river so got of the range
[38:40] nobody knew who I was it was
[38:42] nice just nobody wanted a picture
[38:45] nothing it was just seven days by myself
[38:49] well that's the way brother Rand was he
[38:50] liked to go out hunting and be out there
[38:53] but then some of these other guys
[38:54] started going with him well it wasn't
[38:56] much to a vacation with 10 guys with but
[38:59] um yeah on that occasion there he he
[39:01] just had enough for getet it but U and
[39:05] then there's the there's your name on
[39:06] the mountains but see interesting thing
[39:09] about his name
[39:11] um we got used to his name being William
[39:15] Maran random the two
[39:18] RS okay well he didn't like that name at
[39:22] all he just didn't like it his last
[39:25] driver's license
[39:28] the last driver's license he had in ' 65
[39:32] says
[39:33] Marvin he invented a name just get away
[39:35] from
[39:37] that you know and so then sometime after
[39:42] that no it's just say something he
[39:44] dreamed up and so then after that
[39:47] driver's license so somewhere in the
[39:49] last year or two of his life the Lord
[39:53] showed him the truth of of Maran it has
[39:56] to do with all you people right here in
[39:58] the state
[40:00] because during the Revolutionary War
[40:04] when there was the man called the was it
[40:07] the river
[40:09] rat okay so he was kind of in between
[40:12] you know swamp fo Swamp Fox so he came
[40:16] through a yard and they would just come
[40:18] in take anything they want and keep
[40:19] going well he came into this
[40:22] yard and uh there was no men because
[40:25] they were in the war
[40:27] and here's this lady and she's very
[40:28] pregnant so he was very nice to her you
[40:31] know they didn't steal anything just had
[40:33] a meal and so because he was so nice to
[40:37] her she named the child Marion and from
[40:41] then till today there's a Maran in the
[40:43] family that's where that comes
[40:48] from
[40:53] yeah that
[40:55] question
[41:02] uh so um he have
[41:07] aor yeah he like
[41:11] Fords I
[41:12] mean like the Ford station wagon yeah
[41:16] back then see he he drove General Motors
[41:20] until they come up with the V8 as long
[41:22] as they were straight he had the he had
[41:25] Pontiac whatever ever but then when they
[41:27] came to the V8 he figured that Ford had
[41:30] a better motor so from that
[41:34] on
[41:42] okay was he strict when it
[41:46] came strict about
[41:49] what well yeah there were some rules you
[41:52] know um the uh sad part is he probably
[41:58] saw in Vision more than he wanted to see
[42:01] and didn't say anything but but he he
[42:04] had some rules
[42:07] yeah he um they would travel to like
[42:11] from Jeffersonville Tucson okay so they
[42:15] he like to go early like six o'clock we
[42:17] rolling I'll go to sleep we're going to
[42:19] get there so he' drive and drive and
[42:21] drive well he get tired he pull over
[42:24] everybody be quiet for 10 minutes people
[42:27] so he would take a power
[42:28] nap get up go another four hours you
[42:32] know so they get to this little town I
[42:34] was with them that time and they
[42:36] whatever Town it was in Oklahoma
[42:38] probably and so um it's summertime so
[42:42] 8-year-old Joseph says uh let's get a
[42:46] hotel with a pool it was his request you
[42:49] know and so keeps driving well he gets
[42:52] the last Motel you know before leaving
[42:54] town and it didn't have a
[42:57] pool well the random way is to just slow
[43:01] boil you
[43:03] know not get mad but get
[43:06] even
[43:07] so and so everybody goes in the room
[43:10] cleans up and he sweeps out the car and
[43:12] and now we're going to get in the car
[43:13] and go back to you know supper well as
[43:16] soon as they stop at this little you
[43:18] know place for supper there's a little
[43:21] band out there rock and roll Joe jumps
[43:23] out he starts Jing with these guys
[43:27] oh yeah well soon as he got back to the
[43:30] hotel he got wore
[43:32] out he took the belt out of
[43:37] him
[43:40] yeah
[43:42] yeah
[43:53] dating what was your age well when we
[43:57] met we were
[43:59] 17 we married at
[44:02] 20 you know married in March of
[44:06] 66 okay uh the rules were you had to be
[44:10] in by
[44:11] 11: and one time we we
[44:15] were um sitting in my
[44:18] pickup and it's you know probably
[44:21] quarter to 11 or something and so I'm
[44:23] I'm stopped on the wrong side of the
[44:25] street
[44:26] you know they lived on the left side and
[44:28] I just stopped there well there's no
[44:31] lights anywhere you know street lights
[44:34] but nobody's coming so here comes this
[44:37] car way down there starts coming with
[44:39] the bright lights on so I pull on my
[44:41] lights bright just to let him know that
[44:43] you lights dimmed wouldn't you know it's
[44:46] him he circles and Parks right behind us
[44:49] you
[44:51] know that was very
[44:54] embarrassing he never said a word about
[44:57] it you
[44:58] know he trusted us so
[45:01] yeah yeah he I like I told my kids look
[45:05] I'm going to trust you until you give me
[45:07] reason not
[45:08] to then Hammer comes
[45:14] down but my kids are good liars you
[45:19] know I have two boys and a girl in the
[45:21] middle and so you know they were 18
[45:23] months apart and so something would you
[45:26] know get broken or something went wrong
[45:28] oh nobody knew nothing about it of
[45:30] course well so they all got the weapon
[45:33] then it' be better if you tell the
[45:49] truth oh yeah yeah he blasted it all the
[45:54] time uh they hadn't figured out on their
[45:57] own that the high heels were you know
[45:59] giving them back trouble and different
[46:01] things so he came down hard on that
[46:04] people get rid of their high
[46:06] heels but yeah girls like to look
[46:09] fashionable okay that's fine and girls
[46:13] love attention we all know
[46:15] that right brother
[46:21] jie but there's limits you know uh
[46:26] you go showing off and you're going to
[46:29] attract all kinds of weird
[46:31] people you only want one guy that is the
[46:35] right
[46:38] guy and you
[46:43] asked yeah I had to ask
[46:46] him well it was in a little bit intense
[46:50] um and we're in the room by oursel and
[46:53] and he starts talking about trips I
[46:55] don't know what all kinds of stuff and
[46:58] after a long time I said no brother BR
[47:00] this is all wonderful but I I come for a
[47:02] reason you know set this time up aside
[47:05] for a reason oh what would that
[47:10] be and I said well you must notice that
[47:13] I really like your daughter and I said
[47:16] I'm here to ask for your permission and
[47:18] your blessing to marry her it's kind of
[47:21] be nice you know so then the eyes get
[47:24] real narrow and he said now look
[47:26] I'm going to give you guys permission to
[47:28] be engaged but don't even think about
[47:30] marriage until you both have the baptism
[47:33] of Holy Ghost yeah he says because you
[47:35] see what happens to those that haven't
[47:38] waited and so we put it
[47:41] aside and then I received the Holy Ghost
[47:44] would be the end of
[47:46] September and within a week I was a US
[47:49] Soldier with the Holy Ghost
[47:52] gone and then he left the scene in
[47:54] Christmas
[47:56] and so then when we get to March of
[48:00] 66 I knew what God had done for me and I
[48:03] knew God had done something for her so I
[48:05] called her from Louisiana I said hey
[48:07] let's get married next Tuesday sure
[48:10] enough last Tuesday so we had a private
[48:13] ceremony at the house and then we took
[48:16] off and after two weeks I went to
[48:19] Vietnam for a
[48:20] year so trial by
[48:24] fire brother Collins mared us he was one
[48:28] of the ministers the
[48:34] time
[48:47] wasn't spiritual
[48:49] grow daily
[48:51] prayer I'm asking what we
[48:54] do
[49:02] yeah when he was just home by himself uh
[49:04] he he spent a lot of time in prayer he
[49:07] would go up in the canyon and he'd go
[49:08] different places just hiking you know by
[49:11] himself but uh he spent a lot of time
[49:14] cleaning his guns and loading the
[49:16] ammunition and a lot of things you know
[49:19] but yeah his his secret was was the
[49:22] prayer
[49:24] life and he get up early when everybody
[49:27] else still sleep
[49:34] yeah five
[49:38] yeah
[49:39] yeah yeah well if you guys live long
[49:43] enough you'll realize that you can do
[49:45] with less
[49:47] sleep
[49:52] right are you taking notes of all this
[49:55] are you dood are you doodling
[50:01] yeah what
[50:11] else uh that would probably be at the
[50:13] top of the list but like when he was
[50:16] preaching the the anointed ones at the
[50:17] end time one of the powerful messages we
[50:20] have I was sitting from me to you you
[50:23] know from him when he's preaching that
[50:26] but it's just kind of drifted
[50:29] over only when you get it in in print
[50:33] and then course translating it going
[50:34] over every phrase you know and now I
[50:38] really got it yeah tell them what what
[50:42] your role was
[50:46] about well when I got back from the Army
[50:49] in October of
[50:52] 67 uh the printing work had already
[50:54] begun and they were you know putting
[50:58] books together and everything but there
[51:00] had been somebody that had translated a
[51:02] couple messages but there was nobody
[51:05] around that could do the type setting to
[51:08] get ready for press so they hired me for
[51:11] that and so I realized when I'm going
[51:13] through that okay there's something do
[51:16] this doesn't flow here something's not
[51:18] right so I got the tape well sure enough
[51:21] they left out a paragraph you know and
[51:24] so I had to kind of redo it and get it
[51:26] ready um and that's when I got started
[51:30] but then I got into full-time just
[51:32] translating and that is a real chore
[51:35] because you got to take Kentucky English
[51:39] which people in you know those other
[51:41] countries what is he
[51:43] saying and the people here that are in
[51:46] charge they have the attitude that that
[51:49] it's got to be exactly what he said Well
[51:52] we'd like to think that what we have in
[51:54] the Bible is ex exactly what he said but
[51:57] this is something that came down through
[51:59] several translators and okay it makes
[52:01] sense and this is probably real close to
[52:04] what he said but there's no such thing
[52:07] as word for word translation it's just
[52:09] not anywhere in any language you
[52:12] translate the phrase this is what this
[52:14] says because they have to understand
[52:18] what he's saying you know we want them
[52:20] to have the same blessing that we have
[52:23] uh when they're listening or reading it
[52:25] and that's been the success like of seal
[52:28] book and different things that it's it's
[52:30] it's what it says you know and so I've
[52:33] been ministering for over 50 years and
[52:37] and translating sermons and staying
[52:41] busy brother George I guess it's
[52:43] generally what would you and I not to
[52:45] put you on the spot but what would you
[52:47] to the young
[52:54] people
[53:10] right what do you what would you
[53:13] summarize just to
[53:18] say spiritually yeah well um there's a a
[53:24] formula to stay
[53:26] balanced and we'll go over again Sunday
[53:30] but you like to take notes and you like
[53:33] to you know
[53:35] rules um if you'll read at least one
[53:38] chapter out of your Bible every
[53:41] day and make a point to go through the
[53:44] Bible in one year or sooner there's
[53:46] there's on the phone there's schedules
[53:48] you know knowing your Bible is very very
[53:53] important um because when brother br's
[53:56] preaching like when I'm translating I
[53:58] got to know when he's quoting scripture
[54:00] he doesn't always say John 1 says this
[54:03] he's going along he'll drop in a
[54:06] quotation well if you don't know it's
[54:07] Bible it's not going to get any
[54:09] quotation marks you know um one chapter
[54:13] a day bible one page a day of your
[54:16] church age book listen to at least 20
[54:19] minutes of the
[54:20] tape surely you can find time for this
[54:23] and you pray at anytime if you follow
[54:26] those four steps you will have a more
[54:29] Balanced Life and things will make more
[54:32] sense to
[54:33] you but and it's something anybody can
[54:38] do chapter page 20
[54:53] minutes don't feel better about
[55:04] yourselfer most recently just
[55:10] realiz the world's going away things
[55:13] that I like to do with my physical flesh
[55:16] that happy temporarily but after you're
[55:19] done I immedately why
[55:21] I yeah well and the cell phone is a
[55:24] great way to waste time you go to look
[55:27] for something and you go you get way
[55:30] over here what was I looking
[55:32] for yeah it happens to me but um yeah
[55:36] you got to make time because just like
[55:38] your body needs water needs nourishment
[55:42] you can't go 24 hours without drinking
[55:44] water and you can't go very long without
[55:46] eating food well the soul needs to be
[55:49] fed also it's a
[55:51] similar equation so you you feed the
[55:55] soul by reading God's word it
[56:01] works
[56:11] okay a lot of quiet
[56:15] people but if we were giv out ice cream
[56:17] it'd be a little more
[56:23] noise
[56:38] me well we talked up long enough they'll
[56:41] mess
[56:44] up but I have been deceived along the
[56:53] way
[57:06] yeah yeah no there's um there's a lot of
[57:10] people carrying tablet carrying books
[57:13] they're not all going to
[57:16] heaven just you know because you got the
[57:18] stuff doesn't mean you're going anywhere
[57:21] it's got to be on the
[57:23] inside so it's your age four steps
[57:32] okay no I've heard about it but I've
[57:34] never been in the same
[57:47] place that's
[57:53] it
[57:59] awesome thank you brother well you're
[58:01] very
[58:03] welcome um I just wanted you all to
[58:06] participate yeah your
[58:08] service
