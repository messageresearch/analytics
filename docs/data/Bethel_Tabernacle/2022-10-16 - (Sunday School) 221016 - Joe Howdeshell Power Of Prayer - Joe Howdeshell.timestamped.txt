[0:01] One, make a joyful noise unto unto God
[0:04] all ye lands.
[0:10] Say unto God, how terrible art thou and
[0:13] thy works. Through the greatness of thy
[0:15] power shall thine enemies submit
[0:17] themselves unto thee.
[0:25] Come and see the works of God. He is
[0:28] terrible in his doing toward the
[0:29] children of men.
[0:38] He ruleth by his power forever. His eyes
[0:40] behold the nations. Let not the
[0:43] rebellious exalt themselves
[0:46] sayless people
[0:50] which holdeth our soul in life and
[0:52] suffereth not our feet to be moved. For
[0:56] God,
[1:00] thou broughtest us into the net. Thou
[1:02] ladest affliction upon our loins.
[1:13] I will go into thy house with burnt
[1:15] offerings. I will pay thee my vows.
[1:23] I will offer unto thee burnt sacrifices
[1:25] of fatlings with the incense of rams. I
[1:27] will offer bulocks with goats. Sa
[1:36] I cried unto him with my mouth and was
[1:38] extolled with my tongue.
[1:44] But verily God hath heard me. He hath
[1:47] attended to the voice of my prayer.
[1:49] Blessed be God which hath not turned
[1:52] away my prayer, nor his mercy from me.
[1:55] Let's pray. Heavenly Father, oh God, how
[1:58] we're so thankful, Lord, to have an
[2:01] opportunity to come once again in this
[2:04] house of worship, Lord, that's
[2:05] sanctified and set aside for thee, Lord.
[2:08] Oh God, how we try to keep this place,
[2:10] Lord, as as as sanctified as we can,
[2:13] Lord, God, within our means, Lord. Lord,
[2:15] and we want to come with reverence, dear
[2:17] Father, Lord, and just to lay down all
[2:20] of our burdens of the week, Lord, and
[2:22] just to be able to come in here, Lord,
[2:24] and read your precious word. How
[2:26] privileged we are, Lord, when we think
[2:28] about so many that have died, Lord, and
[2:30] gave their lives so that we might have
[2:32] this precious word before us, Lord. We
[2:34] don't count it as a light thing, Father,
[2:36] Lord. How privileged we are to be able
[2:39] to gather and to meet this morning to
[2:41] hear your word, to read your word, Lord.
[2:43] And father, we just ask that you would
[2:45] come, Lord, and open the word to our
[2:47] hearts. Open our ears that we might hear
[2:49] and our eyes that we might see. In
[2:52] Jesus' name we pray. Amen. You can be
[2:55] seated. And I wanted to talk a little
[2:57] bit this morning
[2:59] um about that last verse. Blessed be God
[3:03] which hath not turned away my prayer,
[3:06] nor his mercy from me. Now, if you have
[3:09] your Bibles also, let's turn to the book
[3:11] of Daniel.
[3:13] uh chapter
[3:14] six and I I wanted to talk
[3:18] about a lot of times when we think about
[3:20] prayer and brother Brandham said many
[3:23] times he said if you have any questions
[3:25] or anything this morning I I have an
[3:27] interactive style of doing Sunday school
[3:29] this this we have the preacher coming
[3:31] later on so um if you have a question
[3:33] just raise your hand and I'll be glad to
[3:35] answer your question so is that okay
[3:40] um I don't mind it at all matter of fact
[3:41] I might even ask you some questions
[3:42] sometimes. So, be ready. All right,
[3:45] brother. You got it. Go ahead, brother.
[3:47] So, brother, I thought it was really
[3:49] good um when brother uh Jason preached
[3:51] last Wednesday night. Brother Caleb put
[3:53] on the minister's uh what what's like
[3:56] being instant in season, out of season.
[3:58] He said, "Being instant just means
[4:00] adding water, right? If it's instant,
[4:02] just add water." He said, "Being
[4:04] instant, just add water of the word."
[4:05] I'm like, "Amen." I like that. So, we
[4:07] got to try to be instant in season, out
[4:09] of season. Now, so I wanted to um Oh,
[4:14] I'm sorry. It's Daniel chapter 10.
[4:16] Daniel chapter 10. We want to read that
[4:17] part
[4:23] where now in the third year of Cyrus,
[4:27] king of Persia, a thing was revealed
[4:29] unto Daniel, whose name was called
[4:31] Belshazar, and the thing was true. But
[4:34] the time appointed was long, and he
[4:36] understood the thing, and had
[4:38] understanding of the vision. And in
[4:39] those days I, Daniel, was mourning three
[4:41] full weeks. In those day uh I ate no
[4:44] pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor
[4:47] wine in my mouth, neither did I anoint
[4:50] myself at all, till three whole weeks
[4:52] were fulfilled. And in the four and 20th
[4:54] day of the first month, as I was by the
[4:57] side of the great river, which is
[4:59] Hideel, then I lifted up mine eyes and
[5:01] looked, and behold, a certain man
[5:03] clothed in linen, whose loins were
[5:05] girded with the fine gold of Eupaz. His
[5:08] body also was like the barrel, and his
[5:10] face as the appearance of lightning, and
[5:12] his eyes as lamps of fire. Would have
[5:13] scared me to death. And his arms and his
[5:16] feet like a color of polished brass, and
[5:19] the voice of his words like the voice of
[5:21] a multitude. And I, Daniel, alone, saw
[5:23] the vision. For the men that were with
[5:25] me saw not the vision, but a great
[5:27] quaking fell upon them, so that they
[5:29] fled to hide themselves. Therefore, I
[5:32] was left alone and saw this great
[5:33] vision, and there remained no strength
[5:35] in me, for my comeliness was turned in
[5:39] me unto into corruption, and I retained
[5:41] no strength. Yet I heard the voice of
[5:44] his words, and that that that describes
[5:46] exactly what would happen to brother
[5:47] Brandham. He said it would leave him
[5:48] just as weak as could be. And he just
[5:51] everybody couldn't understand that. And
[5:52] he's like, "Go to Daniel." He said, he
[5:53] was that he was troubled his head for
[5:55] many days. Yet I heard the voice of his
[5:58] words. And when I heard the voice of his
[5:59] words, then was I in a deep sleep on my
[6:01] face and my face toward the ground. And
[6:04] behold, an hand touched me, which set me
[6:06] upon my knees, and upon the palms of my
[6:07] hands. And he said unto me, "Oh Daniel,
[6:09] a great a man greatly beloved,
[6:12] understand the words that I speak unto
[6:13] thee, and stand upright, for unto thee
[6:16] am I now sent." And when I had spoken
[6:18] this word, when he had spoken this word
[6:20] unto me, I stood trembling. Oh my, I'd
[6:22] love to hear an angel come and talk to
[6:24] me and say, "Greatly beloved, oh Joe,
[6:27] how of shell wouldn't that be great?" Oh
[6:30] my. But he has sent his word to us this
[6:32] morning. Amen. Oh, I just want to read
[6:35] that again.
[6:37] Yet I heard the voice of his words. And
[6:38] when I heard the voice of his words,
[6:40] let's see. And I heard and I says said
[6:42] unto me, verse 11, "Oh Daniel, a man
[6:44] greatly beloved, understand the words
[6:47] that I speak unto thee, and stand
[6:48] upright. For unto thee am I now sent,
[6:51] and when he has spoken his words unto
[6:52] me, I stood trembling." Then said he
[6:54] unto my ear, "Fear not, Daniel, for from
[6:57] the first day that thou set thine heart
[6:59] to understand, and to chasten thyself
[7:01] before thy God, thy words were heard,
[7:03] and I am and I am come for thy words."
[7:06] See, some sometimes we wonder, well,
[7:09] when the angel took him three weeks to
[7:12] get to him, well, was it the actual
[7:15] prayer heard or answered after three
[7:17] weeks? That's not what the angel said.
[7:19] He said, "From the very first day that
[7:21] you started praying, God heard you."
[7:23] Amen.
[7:25] What a wonderful thing.
[7:27] But the prince of the kingdom of Persia
[7:29] withtood me one and 20 days. But lo,
[7:32] Michael, one of the chief princes, came
[7:34] to help me. and I remain there with the
[7:36] kings of Persia. Now I am come to make
[7:39] thee understand what shall befall thy
[7:42] people in the latter days. For yet the
[7:44] vision is for many days. And when he had
[7:47] spoken such words unto me, I set my face
[7:49] toward the ground, and I became dumb.
[7:51] And behold, one like the similitude of
[7:53] the sons of men touched my lips. Then I
[7:55] opened my mouth and spake and said unto
[7:57] him that stood before me, "Oh my Lord,
[7:59] by the vision, my sorrows are turned
[8:01] upon me, and I have retained no
[8:03] strength. For how can the servant of
[8:05] this my lord talk with this my lord? For
[8:08] as for me straight away there remain no
[8:10] strength in me, neither is there breath
[8:12] left him. He even lost his breath.
[8:14] Remember when brother Brandham had the
[8:16] test at the Mayo Clinic and he went
[8:17] under a vision. They said every one of
[8:19] your vital signs were the same except
[8:22] for breathing. You didn't breathe when
[8:24] he went under that vision. And even
[8:26] Daniel said that right right here. Even
[8:28] my breath has left me. Y'all remember
[8:30] him saying that? He said, "You you had
[8:33] every vital sign except for breathing."
[8:35] Then there came again and touched me one
[8:37] like the appearance of a man. And he
[8:39] strengthened me and said, "Oh man,
[8:41] greatly beloved. Fear not. Peace be unto
[8:44] you. Be strong. Yay, be strong." And
[8:47] when he had spoken unto me, I was
[8:48] strengthened and said, "Let my Lord
[8:51] speak, for thou hast strengthened me."
[8:53] Now, I want to read what Brother
[8:55] Brandham talks about here for just a
[8:57] second.
[9:02] Let's
[9:04] see. I'm new to all this stuff here.
[9:09] Now, we we we know that that Daniel had
[9:12] purposed in his heart to hear this
[9:14] prayer to to to understand what God
[9:16] wanted him to know. Brother Bram said he
[9:19] didn't just go off and and just sit down
[9:21] and and in a closet and and just take
[9:23] take a few moments, but he got way out
[9:26] away from everybody. Right? He says,
[9:28] "Daniel down in Babylon, as we spoke of
[9:30] him last night, he had purposed in his
[9:32] heart that he would not defile himself
[9:34] with the Babylonian doctrines. But one
[9:37] day, now this is on hear his voice in
[9:38] 1958, morning service in
[9:42] October." But one day down there, Daniel
[9:44] got in need and he knowed he wanted to
[9:46] hear the voice of God. Yet he had the
[9:49] scriptures, but he needed to hear the
[9:51] voice of God. and he went down to the
[9:53] such river and he just didn't go down
[9:55] there and park his chariot and kneel
[9:57] down in the bull rush and say, 'Lord
[9:58] God, I want to hear you. Where are you
[10:01] at? No, you don't do it that way. Isaiah
[10:04] had took his chariot and the drivers and
[10:05] went down to the river and sent them
[10:07] back. He was going to stay till he heard
[10:09] that's the way he got desperate about
[10:11] it. A lot of times we think about prayer
[10:14] and we think, well, it's a wish list. We
[10:16] sit down and say, "Lord, help me. Help
[10:17] my family." And brother even said, he
[10:19] said, "Just don't get down and say,
[10:21] bless mama. bless papa, bless this one
[10:23] and that and other. It's not a Christmas
[10:25] list. It's not a wish list. And a lot of
[10:27] times even in the world when they say
[10:29] you have our thoughts and prayers, well,
[10:31] what they're really saying is you have
[10:32] our best wishes because they not not
[10:35] really praying and you know they're not
[10:36] really praying. A lot of them,
[10:37] especially the government when the pre
[10:39] the presidents and different ones says,
[10:40] well, our thoughts and prayers are with
[10:42] so- and so. It's just good wishes. It's
[10:44] just, well, we we hope the best for you.
[10:46] But see, hope in our day and time is
[10:49] completely I'm sorry. I'm starting to
[10:50] preach, but hope in our day and
[10:54] time is completely. Well, see, all
[10:57] right. I blame this on brother Jason
[10:59] because he said, "Be in the bullpin
[11:00] warming up because I'm sick and I may
[11:03] have to have you to speak this morning
[11:04] for me." So, I'm sorry. That's kind of
[11:08] when that anointing comes, you just you
[11:10] just got to bear with it. So, y'all just
[11:12] pray for me. All right. So, the word
[11:15] hope, brother Brown, you know what I'm
[11:17] talking about, don't you? Look at him
[11:18] back there snickering. So, all right.
[11:21] So, the word hope means um I hope so,
[11:24] maybe so, think so. I hope it's going to
[11:26] work out that way. But that's not the
[11:28] Bible definition of hope. Who knows the
[11:30] Bible definition of hope? I know you
[11:33] know it, Brother
[11:34] Bradley. It's a steadfast rock solid
[11:38] assurance. Right? That's the Bible
[11:40] definition of hope. Our hope is in the
[11:43] Lord. It's not our hope so, maybe so,
[11:46] think so. No, no. Our
[11:49] hope, I mean, solid. There's nothing on
[11:52] this world that man can make or or
[11:54] anything in this world as solid is that
[11:57] hope. It's rock solid. It's as solid as
[12:00] you can get. That's our hope. Now, so
[12:04] when we talk about prayer, what is it?
[12:05] It's not just a wish list. It's not just
[12:08] getting down and saying, "Lord, I want
[12:09] this. I want that or bless me or bless
[12:11] this." What is the What is prayer?
[12:13] Prayer is actually a communion. It's
[12:16] when you get down. It's a worship with
[12:18] God. You're down and you're emptying of
[12:20] yourself. Your own thoughts, your own
[12:22] ideas, your own wants. You say, "Lord,
[12:26] not my will, but thy will." Whatever it
[12:28] is inside of me, take it out, Lord, and
[12:30] you put you in me. Amen. Being born
[12:34] again is not just taking on a another um
[12:37] a robe. It's you're actually being
[12:39] transformed from who you were to
[12:41] somebody else. That's the that's the
[12:43] whole you must die and be risen again to
[12:46] walk in the newness of life. Not your
[12:49] old nature, not your old person who you
[12:50] were, but now you're walking not my
[12:53] ideas, not my thoughts and my wants and
[12:55] my desires, but I want his life living
[12:57] in me, working in me, working through
[12:59] me. And that's when you pray. It's a
[13:02] worship. It's a It's an emptying out.
[13:05] It's a conversation when you have a
[13:07] conversation with somebody. It's not
[13:08] one-sided. Well, I can talk to that wall
[13:10] and I talk to people and I I would
[13:11] probably be better off talking to that
[13:13] wall. But you can talk to the wall all
[13:15] day long. But when you have a
[13:17] conversation, you don't get anything
[13:18] from that wall. But when you talk to
[13:20] somebody, you're receiving too, right?
[13:23] You talk and you receive. You speak and
[13:25] you receive. It's communion. It's
[13:27] fellowship. It's it's and when you
[13:30] fellowship with like I can fellowship my
[13:32] wife and we have wonderful time of
[13:34] talking but just think about when you
[13:36] fellowship with the creator of heaven
[13:38] and earth the creator of everything that
[13:41] we know of. Oh my well our minds we just
[13:45] have we can't even fathom and
[13:47] comprehend. We think about God you know
[13:49] they say I think when the Russians sent
[13:51] the cosminauts up in the 50s they said
[13:53] well we proved there's no god up there.
[13:54] There's nothing but blackness in space.
[13:56] Well, you you can no more take a rocket
[13:58] ship to to heaven than you can dig a
[14:00] hole to hell.
[14:02] I had some friends that that swore up
[14:04] and down that they d they dug a deep
[14:06] hole in Russia and they stuck a
[14:07] microphone and you could hear the
[14:08] screams of hell. I said, I don't think
[14:09] you can do that. I don't think that from
[14:12] this dimension, you can't get there no
[14:14] more than you can take a rocket and go
[14:15] to heaven. It's not going to happen.
[14:17] Amen. And so when you go back all the
[14:19] way through space and time in the
[14:21] universe and and get all the way back to
[14:23] the and even science now believes that
[14:24] it all came from a little point the size
[14:27] of the head of a pen all the energy and
[14:29] all the molecules and all the all
[14:31] everything that was created in the in
[14:32] the whole entire universe all the planet
[14:35] stars and everything came from a size
[14:37] that's what they say the size of a pen
[14:40] head. I'm like my goodness. Well we've
[14:42] always said he's got the whole world in
[14:44] his hands. I didn't realize that he had
[14:45] the whole universe just on his
[14:47] fingertips. So, but see that's science.
[14:50] God said you give him a little while and
[14:52] they'll just prove him right. They try
[14:53] to prove him wrong, they just prove him
[14:54] right. So, when we think about this
[14:57] infinite God who created all things, he
[14:59] was outside of time. You can't go back
[15:02] in billions and billions of and ever see
[15:03] God. Not in this dimension. He doesn't
[15:06] live in this realm. And even up a little
[15:09] higher when brother Brandham went beyond
[15:11] the curtain of time, he said he's up
[15:12] even higher than that. Amen. So where is
[15:15] this God? Oh my. So we need to spend
[15:18] time in fellowship with him. Need to
[15:20] spend time in prayer and worship. Amen.
[15:23] Shutting out everything.
[15:26] Oh my. I'm about to get all over my
[15:28] sermon. I was going to preach.
[15:32] No, not this morning,
[15:35] brother. He had to get plum away from
[15:37] all the soldiers and all the astronomers
[15:39] and the wise men, all the doctors of
[15:41] theology. Oh my. And so forth that was
[15:44] trying to tell him this. You do this
[15:47] Daniel. You do this Daniel. But he got
[15:49] away from all of it. That's the way you
[15:52] got to do
[15:53] it. This you do this D. See that's the
[15:56] way you got to do it. And he got down on
[15:59] the river and he stayed there for 21
[16:01] days wrestling with the angel of the
[16:03] Lord. Kind of like what Jacob did. But
[16:06] we're told that he looked out upon the
[16:08] waters. There he saw an angel standing
[16:11] with his foot on the land in the sea and
[16:13] raised up his hands and swore by him
[16:14] that lives forever and ever. When the
[16:16] things that Daniel saw come to pass
[16:18] there should be no more. He had been
[16:20] delayed 21 days because of the evil of
[16:23] the
[16:26] land.
[16:27] Now I don't want to get ahead of myself
[16:31] there. So let's just stop. Okay, we got
[16:35] about 12 13 more minutes here and I want
[16:36] to try to set this up. So, we know that
[16:40] back um I think around
[16:43] 194748 around that time, Brother
[16:45] Brandham had a vision and he was sitting
[16:47] there and I remember him describing it.
[16:49] He said that he was sitting there and he
[16:50] saw his his um I believe it was he heard
[16:53] a a lamb. It was caught up in some
[16:55] bushes and he heard a little l a voice
[16:58] that the lamb was bleeding and it
[16:59] bleeded. I only said one word,
[17:02] Miltown. Miltown. And you all know the
[17:04] story. Yeah. But when you go back and
[17:06] you really think about what happened,
[17:08] God never came and told brother
[17:10] Brandham, "All right, I got a little
[17:11] girl down there down there named Georgia
[17:13] Carter. She's in a town of Miltown.
[17:15] She's got tubercular menitis. She's
[17:18] laying there. She's been praying." No,
[17:20] he heard one word, Miltown. He had never
[17:23] even heard of Miltown.
[17:26] So why didn't he have all the
[17:29] information? Sometimes when we pray, we
[17:31] don't always get all the information.
[17:33] Amen. Brother Ram got one word and he
[17:36] had to find out a couple services like
[17:39] does anybody know where Miltown is?
[17:40] Finally, brother, yeah, it's down so and
[17:41] so 30, 40 miles away. So then he got the
[17:44] rights and went down there and and he
[17:46] and after that he got to the little
[17:48] church and he said, "Well, Lord, do you
[17:49] want me to preach on the street?" He
[17:51] said he went in and got a soap box.
[17:53] That's what he said. And come out and
[17:54] set it on the and sat down and stood on
[17:56] the corner. And he said he had he
[17:57] couldn't come up with nothing to preach
[17:59] about.
[18:01] You believe that? The prophet of God.
[18:03] Yeah. He said, "I couldn't think of
[18:05] nothing to preach about." Can you
[18:06] imagine him standing there on that soap
[18:07] box, people walking by and I might come
[18:10] up to him just standing there?
[18:13] He said, "Well, Lord, what do you want
[18:14] me to do?" So he walked up and saw a
[18:16] Baptist church up on the hill and had
[18:18] they'd had a scandal and everything and
[18:19] he sat there and he said, "Lord, if you
[18:21] want the doors open, send somebody by."
[18:23] No more. And he said that, a man said,
[18:24] "Do you want to get in the church?" He
[18:25] said, "Yes, sir." So, you know the
[18:27] story. had a revival started up and and
[18:30] the problem with that area was there was
[18:32] so much unbelief that he said, "I don't
[18:35] even know." Let me see if I can find
[18:37] that quote there. I want to go back and
[18:40] um see what he said. We got a few We got
[18:42] a few minutes, don't
[18:45] we? Now, let's see.
[18:50] Um I bookmarked it. I thought I
[18:56] did. Well, let's see. So, anyway, so it
[19:00] said, okay, so I'll read this right
[19:02] here. So, it says, oh, yes.
[19:05] Um, I don't care what my church says.
[19:11] Says, well, the devil's a liar. He don't
[19:14] want me to tell this this
[19:15] morning. Looking. Okay. So now when I
[19:19] got down Okay. So here we go. So now get
[19:24] this name now so you can write to her.
[19:27] She she I'll wait a minute for I call
[19:29] her name and address. So you get your
[19:31] pencil and piece of paper and she lived
[19:32] down the hill and her people belong to a
[19:34] certain denomination of church that
[19:36] absolutely doesn't believe in the
[19:38] spirit. Now what is sin?
[19:41] Unbelief.
[19:43] Unbelief. That's the original sin. It
[19:45] wasn't the act. It was the unbelief that
[19:47] led to the act. But the original sin is
[19:50] unbelief. It don't matter what title
[19:52] you've got. It don't matter what lodge
[19:53] that you attend every Sunday and call
[19:55] yourself a Christian. If you don't have
[19:57] belief, you're still you'll die in your
[19:59] sins. The Pharisees had it. The
[20:01] Sadducees had it. The word is dead until
[20:04] it's quickened by the spirit. And the
[20:06] worst spirit is a religious spirit.
[20:07] Ain't that right? Worst spirit. You
[20:10] can't even hardly talk to them. You ever
[20:12] tried to witness to somebody that was
[20:13] absolutely staunch and just died in the
[20:15] wool? Oh my, it's like talking to that
[20:17] wall right there. You'd be better off.
[20:19] The word is dead until it's quickened by
[20:21] the spirit, but they don't believe in
[20:22] that. See belief. Jesus couldn't even do
[20:26] anything because of unbelief.
[20:29] The God of heaven, manifested in flesh,
[20:32] incarnate God, walking on this earth,
[20:36] could not do anything because of the
[20:38] unbelief of the people. Right. Amen. Put
[20:42] that in perspective.
[20:44] A church, I don't know whether you have
[20:46] them up here or not, but they had made
[20:48] the announcement that anybody that
[20:49] attended my church would be given their
[20:51] letter when they come back. Not only did
[20:53] they not want to go in, but they
[20:54] prevented them others from going
[20:57] in. So I said, "All right, somebody will
[21:00] come." So we had a church full that
[21:01] winter. And so Mr. Hall, come to me. And
[21:04] he said, "Brother Brandon, there's a
[21:05] little girl laying over here over the
[21:07] hill here. She's about 20 years old.
[21:09] She's been laying flat on her back for
[21:11] nine years and eight months. Not to move
[21:13] from the bed. Tubercular plum through.
[21:14] The doctor hasn't even visited her for
[21:17] the last three or four years. There's
[21:18] nothing they done since LA last year.
[21:20] She has tubercular of the throat,
[21:22] tubercul of the lungs, tubercul
[21:23] intestinal tract, tubercular of the
[21:25] female organs, and said she got your
[21:27] little book a couple of months ago. Oh
[21:29] my. When do you think God heard her
[21:31] prayer?
[21:33] Do you think he heard her prayer when
[21:35] she finally got up off of that bed? Or
[21:37] do you think he heard her prayer the
[21:39] first time she got that book and started
[21:40] praying? And God sent that vision to
[21:43] that prophet. And it took him how long?
[21:46] He said he preached eight days in that
[21:48] in that meeting. It took him weeks and
[21:49] weeks and weeks. Yeah.
[21:53] To finally get there. And she had the
[21:55] book for three months and was praying.
[21:59] And just as as he said that, something
[22:01] said to me, "There's the lamb that's
[22:04] hooked in the wilderness." So I thought,
[22:06] "Oh well, Lord, you make a way. I'll
[22:08] just wait for you, but I knew that was
[22:11] the witness of the spirit." I
[22:14] waited. Now I want to go ahead and I was
[22:17] going to skip over this, but for
[22:18] somebody who hasn't ever heard this, I
[22:19] want to read this. And so finally when
[22:21] the meeting ended about 8 days, so all
[22:23] this had been going on, he had a revival
[22:24] in town. I was going to go home and on
[22:27] and that day the mother give consent to
[22:29] come over. said, "We we'll all leave the
[22:32] house if he wants you to come over just
[22:34] to satisfy her. This is on looking to
[22:36] the unseen 1950 looks like in August
[22:39] 16th. We won't even stay while he's
[22:43] there." And so I said, "Well, I'll go
[22:45] anyhow." So the mom and dad didn't want
[22:47] to be there. So they finally let him
[22:48] come to pray for. But said, "Well, I'll
[22:51] leave the house if he wants you to come
[22:52] over just to satisfy her, but but we'll
[22:54] leave the house. We won't even stay
[22:56] while he's there." Brother Bram said,
[22:58] "Hypocrites.
[23:00] He said, "I'd rather meet God as a
[23:01] ranked sinner, an alcoholic drug addict,
[23:04] than a hypocrite." Think about that.
[23:07] Religious people, hypocrites. Jesus said
[23:10] that to the scribes and Pharisees.
[23:12] Hypocrites.
[23:14] So, I went down and went to the room,
[23:16] went in the room. When I walked in the
[23:18] room, I knew that was the woman. I
[23:20] looked at her. She weighed 37 pounds.
[23:22] Almost 20 years old. I think she's 18
[23:24] exactly. She was nothing but bone. She
[23:27] couldn't raise her hand. She couldn't
[23:28] raise her sputum cup. Her mother had
[23:30] taken the polyy fairly young woman.
[23:32] Turned gray as she could be and sat
[23:34] right there. And they hadn't even woman
[23:36] had the girl had never seen out the
[23:38] window for eight years. Nine years and
[23:40] eight months. She laid on the bed. This
[23:42] is plain. But they couldn't even put her
[23:43] on the bed pan. They had a rubber sheet
[23:45] under her and just changed the sheets in
[23:47] that manner. And then she her limbs
[23:49] right up there was just about this big
[23:51] around. I imagine that's what he said.
[23:52] and you and you write to her now and he
[23:54] gives the address and she'll write you
[23:56] back and give the doctor statements. And
[23:58] so when I went down across the hill, all
[24:00] the Christians said, "If that girl gets
[24:02] healed, it'll turn everything in this
[24:04] country to crying." But that's just the
[24:07] time you want to watch. God doesn't heal
[24:10] to make a showing. See, and they won't
[24:14] do it. And they won't do it usually.
[24:16] That's the hardest person in the world
[24:18] to be healed. When everybody's looking,
[24:21] then all the demons with their power
[24:23] focus right on them in their unbelief.
[24:25] Unbelief is the demon power. Of course,
[24:29] he that believeth not is condemned
[24:33] already. Now, he said, "I went in and
[24:35] had prayer for the little girl and she
[24:37] was telling me about reading where in
[24:38] the paper another girl had been healed."
[24:40] He talks about that little Methodist
[24:41] church. She was a nail, I think was her
[24:43] name. how the Lord moved by vision, sent
[24:46] me away in the wilderness hunting across
[24:47] the hills and found her. Said the
[24:49] woman's married now she's about 16 years
[24:51] old, 18. She was telling me about that.
[24:53] Well, I seen her faith was in the
[24:55] vision. So, I want to read on down to
[24:57] where she gets out of the bed because I
[24:58] love to hear this.
[25:02] So, then I was going up that night. All
[25:04] right. So, I want to hear I want to read
[25:06] on down here. So, he's sitting there
[25:08] praying. He says he saw that the um go
[25:10] by the way of Carter's. So that's
[25:13] Georgia Carter was the girl that got
[25:14] healed. Thus say he said I said thus
[25:17] sayith the angel of God who's fed me
[25:19] since the days I was born on this earth
[25:20] and has never lied to me. Georgia Carter
[25:22] will be well a well woman in the next
[25:24] hour.
[25:26] So she began to pray and thought of her
[25:28] daughter. Okay. So her mama saw the
[25:30] vision saw everything like that. I don't
[25:31] have time to read all of it but he said
[25:34] I took her by the hand and I said as the
[25:35] Lord God has said to me in the name of
[25:37] the Lord Jesus Christ rise up and
[25:39] behold. and how she was able to raise up
[25:41] limbs that big around. Hadn't moved for
[25:43] nine years and eight months laying on a
[25:45] bed. But when God speaks, he gives
[25:47] strength. That's right. Taking her by
[25:49] the hand, she looked at me like that.
[25:51] Her eyes looked like they set. And I
[25:52] took her by the hand and raised her from
[25:54] the bed. In less than a moment's time,
[25:56] she was walking through the house. She
[25:58] was screaming. Her mother pitched over
[26:00] in the room, cold, fainted. The girl
[26:02] opened the door and walked out, sat on
[26:03] out on the grass, and began to bless the
[26:05] grass and bless the leaves. Bless her
[26:07] little heart. The first time she had
[26:09] seen the leaves in the grass from nearly
[26:11] over nine years as she was laying on
[26:13] that bed and the people began to run
[26:14] from the neighborhood everywhere. I done
[26:16] went outside toward the hills toward the
[26:18] church. I couldn't stand around there.
[26:19] The anointing was just blessing all
[26:21] around. started up the hill and said,
[26:25] "So her father comes in and sees all
[26:28] that and and so brother Brandham says
[26:30] this here and I want to go back
[26:34] and
[26:35] says he had to get plum away from all
[26:38] the
[26:39] soldiers but we're told that he looked
[26:41] upon and okay this is back on hear his
[26:44] voice he said and if he was delayed 21
[26:46] days because of the evil of that land in
[26:49] the days of Persia what would he be in
[26:52] this
[26:53] day? How long could he be
[26:56] delayed? But that underlying fa undying
[26:59] faith, that hunger and desire in the
[27:01] human heart that won't say no to God,
[27:04] but will hold on till God speaks from
[27:06] heaven. You can't play with this with
[27:08] this gospel. It's not to be played with.
[27:10] It must hit the tack 10 times out of 10.
[27:13] If you don't know what he's talking
[27:14] about there, he used to practice target
[27:16] shooting 50 yards with a thumb tack and
[27:19] he would shoot off-handed. Brother
[27:20] Charlie Cox, I I heard him say, "If you
[27:23] ever shot offhanded, that is no small
[27:25] feat." Let me tell you right now, he
[27:27] would hit a thumbtack at 50 yards with a
[27:29] 22 standing up, not leaning on a tree,
[27:32] not on a sandbag, off-handed. He said
[27:34] he's the best shot he had ever seen of
[27:35] anybody in his entire life. He said,
[27:38] "You've got to hit that tack times out
[27:40] of 10. Not nine out of 10, 10 out of
[27:42] 10." That's the way he was he was
[27:44] natured. That's the way God made him.
[27:46] It's got to be perfect or if it if it
[27:49] isn't right, it won't work. It's got to
[27:51] be perfect. Daniel
[27:54] prayed. Now, that ought to be
[27:56] encouraging to us. Sometimes we'll pray
[27:58] for a little bit, say, "Well, Lord, it
[27:59] hadn't happened yet." But just think of
[28:01] the unbelief. Just think of the
[28:03] unbelief. And even the people, so-called
[28:05] Christians, who don't believe in the
[28:07] moving of the spirit. Amen. He talks
[28:10] about here in faith is a substance. A
[28:12] little girl is there that weighed 47
[28:14] pounds. He said 37 a minute ago. 27
[28:17] years old, weighed 47 pounds by the name
[28:19] of Georgia Carter with tubercular. She
[28:21] belonged to this same church. And she
[28:24] said the people through the neighborhood
[28:25] said said she'd been on her back for
[28:28] nine years and six months. Let her get
[28:29] well and we'll believe it. That's what
[28:31] they all said. You let her get well and
[28:33] everybody in the whole country will
[28:35] believe it. He said, "But my friends,
[28:37] she's my piano player in the Miltown
[28:39] Baptist Church tonight." But do they
[28:42] believe? No.
[28:44] Even one raised from the dead, they
[28:47] don't believe in it. Now you think about
[28:49] that. No matter what you would say or
[28:51] do, if that unbelief is permeating
[28:53] through that land, it took the angel 21
[28:57] days in Daniel's day to get to him for
[28:58] the answer of prayer. It took George
[29:00] Carter 3 to four months for the
[29:05] messenger angel means messenger for a
[29:08] healing angel to get to her. Just think
[29:10] about even an hour day how much longer
[29:12] it might take. So don't give up. If
[29:14] you're praying for your loved ones, if
[29:15] you're praying for something to happen
[29:17] in your life, if you're praying for your
[29:19] son or your daughter or your husband or
[29:21] your wife or whoever it might be, even
[29:22] your mama or your daddy, don't give up.
[29:25] Don't don't be weary and welloing. Just
[29:27] stay right there.
[29:29] Because the thing about prayer is that
[29:31] what you have to do, what I was trying
[29:32] to get to a little bit ago when we was
[29:34] talking about God and his infinite, a
[29:36] lot of people just say, "Well, there's
[29:38] an old man up there with a white beard
[29:39] and he's always mad, but Jesus loves
[29:41] me." Well, that's kind of the thinking
[29:43] of the world. But see, Jesus, uh, I'm
[29:46] sorry, in Hebrews, it says, "When you
[29:47] pray, believe that God is." You've got
[29:51] to believe. What does it say here?
[29:53] Hebrews chapter 6 of chapter 11:6 it
[29:56] says when you
