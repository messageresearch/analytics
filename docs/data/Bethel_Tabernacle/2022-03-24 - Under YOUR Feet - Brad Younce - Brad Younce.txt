this uh little intro before when we sing this just give it again for those of you who didn't know the man who wrote this song battled an addiction in his life with drugs for years and he wrote this song out of his deliverance and he said if i could have the devil in a room and he said have him sitting down he said this is what i'd like to say to him [Music] might not recognize me now the chains that once surrounded me are laying on the ground [Music] you can't keep digging up my past you may have had a laugh or two but you won't get the last you might not recognize me now maybe i was blind but now i see maybe i was bound but now [Music] maybe you should listen when i [Music] if you want scars i'll show you scars all the wounds upon the hands of light that pierced the door if i were you i'd be afraid everything you meant for guilt the cross is meant for grace [Applause] maybe i was found but now maybe i was bound but now [Music] maybe you should listen when i speak maybe you need reminded you're under my feet [Music] i think it's time you meet my maker i think it's time you meet my maker oh i think it's time that you remember i think it's time that you remember maybe i was blind but now i see maybe i was bound but now i'm free maybe you need reminders [Music] maybe you're a lie that i don't need maybe you should listen when i speak maybe you need remind if you're under my feet maybe this is where we say farewell maybe you should crawl on back to hell maybe you need reminding you're under my feet [Music] under my feet [Music] [Applause] there's only one place for the devil that's under your feet let's all stand together appreciate them songs i hand-picked two of them and the third one is just a special treat i'm not going to tell you which ones i picked i'm sure he didn't enjoy that y'all ready to have church i am too let's go for the throne for prayer before we start heavenly father lord we just stand before you tonight god and in thee lord we're a needy people father but god you're you're an all-knowing and you know what each one of us has need of tonight god father you could take these words that i have and may you that you can custom fit to each person's ears for what they have need of god lord jesus i've studied lord and i've i've tried to apply myself but god without you lord and to come down he'll be nothing but god we're needing the preacher to come up on the scene lord i'm just a body that you're going to use father help me to step aside lord and lord that you could take full control that my lips can say what you want me to say and just hush them up not to say what you don't want me to but god come down in this service lord and move among your people father cause we know tonight that the devil is under our feet father we just get that revelation what a different kind of people we would be father i just pray god we place this service into your hands for your control in jesus name amen if you have your bibles let's turn to romans chapter 8 verse 28 and you're going to say what in the world has this got to do with under your feet well you're going to find out because i didn't know until the lord started dealing with me romans 8 28 i told the brother about gideon i said listen i said i've got scriptures all jumbled up it's all messed up but i hope they're in order and they're meant to be maybe it might look like something's not right but it is just hang on romans chapter 8 verse 28 and we know that all things work out to the good to them that love god to them who are called according to his purpose for whom he did for new for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he's also justified and whom he justified he's also glorified and then what shall we say to these things if god be for us who can be against us may god had a blessing you can have your seats i was telling brother jason before monday morning i was going to speak on more than a match and then monday morning it all got changed to this which we're still going to speak on more than a match but it's going to be under the feet under your feet more than a match means easily able to defeat we're facing an enemy tonight that we can defeat him it's so easy to beat the devil it means we can easily defeat him no matter what takes place the devil is under your feet tonight if we could just realize it but back in romans chapter 8 we know that all things work together for good to them that love god everything works out to the good not just when you're up on the mountain when everything's all hunky door and you're on your little clouds floating around and everything's rosy but it's like brother jd brought to us this past weekend when you're in your trials and tribulations when there's been testing your everything working out to the good everything is for your good it don't matter what's facing you what you're facing it's all for your good we know all things work out to the good to them that love god you love god everything's going to work out to your good when you're in the lowest valley is working out to your good when you're on the top of the mountain it's working out for your good hallelujah for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son god foreknew you so because he foreknew you he predestinated you he predestinated you to be conformed to the image which is having the same form it's what conform means having the same form similar conformed to that means tonight if you're in that conform to the image of god you are nothing but a walking talking jesus i walk jesus i talk jesus i act jesus i am jesus i'm conformed to his image moreover whom he did predestinate just because you predestinated you he's called you and he's called you he's justified you he's justified you he's glorified you hallelujah he's already done it what shall we say paul's fired up after all how can he not be when you know will you be the back parts of god's mind how can you not be fired up tonight god foreknew you he said what shall we say to these things if god before us who is going to be against us paul's going to ask in these verses he's going to mention who a few times and this is the first one who's going to be against you next verse he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us how shall he not with him also freely give us all things you've got god-given rights god has given you everything he's given you healing he's given you brother god given every promise in this book is yours all because he's freely give you all things god-given rights you have a right to defeat the devil that's a direct quote god-given right you have a right to defeat the devil so if that's the case who is going to lay anything to god's who's going to lay anything to the charge of god's elect there's that who again who is going to do it satan is at the throne daily satan is that we know he has a right to the throne of god and job near the story and job when the sons of god present themselves before the throne of god and satan came among the mist where you been satan oh i've been walking to and fro i've been walking two and a throw seeking who he made of our is what he's doing so he has access to the throne he's even got access in the building tonight satan is the most faithful member in church he probably got here early sometimes we see him get here early he beats us to church sometimes that's why when you come in here he goes and starts messing around with the sound system he starts messing around with the internet sometimes he starts messing around with that organ making it sound funny he don't want you to get something from god so he's already in the build he knows when it's time to come to church he's faithful brother he's the most faithful member if we just start getting him to pay tithes if he's going to come to church start putting money in the offering devil woo hallelujah but he's always day and night around the throne accusing you he goes up and he says you know what josh did today you know what caleb did today you know what chris did today he he okay just because they didn't didn't call your name satan knows who you are satan's already been at the throne this very day telling god what you've done just this day trying to accuse you but i'm here to tell you you repent what sin satan he has access to the sea of forgetfulness what brother brown said he has access to that sea of forgetfulness he should because that's where he lives but we don't i kind of wish we did because i know if i had a stick of dynamite i'd go down and blow blow that sea of forgetfulness blow everything out of it where stuff's not in my memory y'all know what i'm talking about or stuff's not your memory of your past he's constantly bombarding you but i hear what sin what sin oh brother brandon said he has access to that sin forgive us but we don't just think of it god cannot remember that we ever sinned think of that he says you young folks what about that what about it god don't even remember that you ever sin he can forget the whole thing and never will be brought into his memory anymore wouldn't that be something just as quick as you say god i'm sorry it's gone not from here only thing god says is what's sin i don't remember it it's about as far as the east is from the west and you know how far that is god don't even know what you've done but if we just move fast past that tonight what a free person we would become what kind of church services we got we know what the greatest battle ever fought it's in the mind mind battles our memories not erased i can tell you one day i was stuff happened several years ago that you know i'm not ashamed of i'm ashamed i should say but she said that way it constantly bombards you you're always repenting when you actually already truly repent you just don't know god don't know but i'm sitting here praying because i would pray every day god forgive me god forgive me i didn't mean to do that and i guess god got tired of hearing me god said what are you even talking about i don't know what you're talk all i hear is what you're confessing with your lips oh brother that done something different i was turned around different from that day on i don't repent for them things no more because they're gone they're in the sea of his forgetfulness and whatever's got you going tonight right here tell the devil where it's at talent that was it's in hell where he belongs get away from me satan you know satan starts starts telling you about you about your past you know what's funny i don't know if it happens to you but it happens to me why is it he always wants to bring up stuff you've done since you got saved he don't bring up stuff you've done before you before you started coming to church it's stuff you've done since you got saved he wants to bombard you with that hallelujah he starts bringing up your pass oh you've done this and all you've done that he keeps you beat down don't it if we dwell on he keeps us beat down but what's sin if the devil's bringing up your past i stole this from brother donnie if the devil keeps bringing up your past just go ahead and remind him of his future just tell the devil before you were created i was already here and when you're destroyed we'll still be going on it's just the beginning it's just the beginning brother brown said that sin was confessed to the world god don't even know that you ever sinned hallelujah he don't even know that's right he's he said he put them in a sea of forgiveness to remember them no more at all against you than men and women stands in the presence of god as sons and daughters of god the very nature of god in their hearts the blood of jesus has so remitted sins till god don't even remember them he don't even remember we even sinned what's sin hallelujah god puts our sins in the sea of forgiveness blocks the amount and there has if that they never happened and did we stand by the grace of god through jesus christ our lord pure and holy just as holy as he was because he doesn't see me when i come up there he sees his own son that's when you're conformed to the image of jesus christ he looks at you he sees jesus christ oh he can't see because i'm his son and he only sees his son and we don't have to think about sins anymore it's all gone it's under the blood you don't even have to worry about it anymore it's out of god's memory he don't even remember it no more so who i'm going to ask you again who shall lay anything to the charge of god's elect who it is god that justifies justified as though you've never done it in the first place that's what that means you've got you're being cleared hallelujah you've been cleared once we repented it's gone it's never to be thought of again we know what brother matt's been he talked to us a couple weeks ago when that old nature's burned out of you he loses authority he don't have power over you he has influence you'll be bothered with no sticky nature until we leave this world but you've got overcoming power tonight we've got over power tonight to overcome every devil who is he that condemneth it is christ that died yes yeah rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of god who maketh intercession for us who another who shall separate us from the love of christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or negatives or pearl or sword who is going to separate you from the love of christ who you know who is who is this who paul's speaking about i'll tell you first peter 5 9 be sober sober abstain from wine be sober watch be sober be vigilant vigilant to watch to give strict attention to to be cautious he's trying to get his point across be sober be vigilant i want you to be watching oh but we get so drunk on the things of the world we're not watching nothing we're not watching what god's doing we're not watching what satan's doing we just stagger in the church sometimes with the world on us drunk on the world and we can't even get into service i think he would do us good sometimes if we just come to church early sit there and pray the whole world off of you or you can enter into the atmosphere oh brother what what a what a help you would be to the preachers if you come in here and you're under hallelujah don't start throwing stuff at me can you say man brother inside joke be sober be vigilant because your adversary i know i said it before i'll do it again he's not your friend your adversary is not your wife your adversary is not your husband it's not even your pastor the adversary is not brother luther just because brother luther gets on your kids he's doing your job that's not your adversary yeah adversary adversary's a devil [Music] it's not somebody you disagree with the devil has a roaring line walketh about seeking whom he may devour he wants to swallow you up seeking whom he may devour but i'm here to tell you tonight we were made to defeat the devil there's nothing more i like than to give devil trouble i know he's going to fight us all in the morning you're afraid to say amen because you know he's going to be right there at your door in the morning when you wake up but i want the devil to know tonight no more satan i want him when i get out of bed in the morning and says oh no here comes brad yance again he knows your name like i said a little bit ago see come on put him under your feet the devil knows you the devil knows who we are today you didn't catch him by surprise hold on a minute where'd caleb come from no he knows you brother he's going to fight you but greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world he sees god's hand on you but i want him to say to me just go on back to bed because there's nothing i can do with you you are more than a match for me go back to bed hallelujah you know who you're fighting against you're in a war we're not on a picnic we got a box of chicken wing down here at huntington island having a picnic this is a battle we're going to somebody we're fighting against one of my favorite sermons how can i overcome overcome means to recognize the devil in every one of his tricks lots of people says there's no devil it's just a thought don't you believe that there's a real devil and he's just as real as you are or anybody a real devil and you must recognize him real you must know that he's a devil then the same time that you recognize him simple overcoming you recognize him and know that he is a devil and he's against you then to overcome you must recognize that the god in you is greater and mightier than he is he's that one that's in you has already overcome him hallelujah this next line and by his grace you are more than a match for him brother travis it don't matter what he throws up against you you're more than a match for the devil you are the undefeated unbeatable bride there's not a devil in hell can defeat you it might seem like it someday oh hallelujah who you can't do all this by yourself you got to have somebody greater on your side that's when that holy ghost fire comes in and burns that old nature out you have backing we have backing who is going to separate us from the love of god paul's going to answer the question nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us more than conquerors jesus was conquered conquered we're more than a conqueror you heard the story about the boxer who won a big championship they bring in the check and he says to the conqueror he turns around and hands it to his wife and says she is more than a conqueror that's what god's done to you he's handed you the check what do you need tonight fill out your check you're more than a conqueror hallelujah you know what he did jesus went up to the world to be tempted i'm go ahead and add this in right now after i drink temptations come from the devil no man's tempted of god now not saying that god won't allow satan to give you a little temptation to see what you're going to do test test your testimony to see what you'll do but he'll he won't god will not tempt you like he did jesus he comes jesus said if thou be the son of god if thou be make these stones bread if you are the son of god fall off that temple there the angels will catch you if you're the son of god bow down and worship me virantos jesus was tempted to he could have got all these kingdoms without a sacrifice without a calvary but if he did where we've been tonight we wouldn't be sitting right here i'm so glad he didn't [Music] he overcome the devil to show you everyone he was tempted at all points of life as we are but he did it without sin hallelujah he defeated the devil by the word to give you something you could defeat the devil by i said it i say it again a favorite line the word of god will defeat the devil anytime anywhere any place under any circumstance so what's your circumstance what is it the you can defeat the devil in it no matter what what's coming against you oh he was tempting everything hallelujah i'm skipping i said i had a lot for i am persuaded verse 38 that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things presence nor things to come nor highs nor death nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord there's nothing that's going to separate you not trouble no devil no hell no death nothing it's going to separate you from the love of god [Music] hey man you gotta have a power behind you to beat this devil james 4 7 submit yourselves therefore to god resist the devil resist the devil and he will flee from you this resists you need to be like colonel the incredible hulk resistance face it you're gonna face your devil you've got to walk right up to him don't be scared of him because once you resist the devil once he'll flee from you that's in the word resist the devil and he flees show him how tough you are he'll he'll start running he's going to avoid this fight who wants to fight incredible hulk who wants to fight against god who don't want to who don't want to fight against god because he knows he's already been beat before but he's made you more than conquerors you're more than a conqueror brother brown says just one line don't you never stop one second for the devil we always sit and talk to him what do you think about that service last night oh it was good but don't take him serious devil i know i said amen i know i said amen but can't take it easy on me today how are you going to stand up to the devil how are you going to be able to resist him what we need to do to be more than a match for the devil and it always comes back to this everybody that preaches this what you need inside your heart you the whole not again you got to get the holy ghost i don't care if you're the youngest person in the building the oldest one you've got to have the holy ghost because you can't beat no devil on your own but with it you're more than a match for the devil man you've heard you heard a basketball team when they're saying this team is more than a match so this this team and oh you see it happen all the time in basketball get in you know what i'm talking about or you're supposed to be the best team on the court and the first two or three quarters don't show it the other team is actually leading you there's no spark in the team but suddenly that's what sometimes we are in church we'll come and sit down in our pew no spark of life we're just going through the motions raise your hands praise the lord brother tony have to ask us okay that's probably not my territory come in dead drunk on the things of the world keep bringing that up for some reason we're on the verge of getting beat we got to do

amen don't you appreciate that the person of his word came and showed up tonight amen i love that message brother brad you preached i mean that that reminded me so much when he was talking about the incredible hulk it reminded me of brother branham when he talks about uh i think he said it was his mother and there was a great big man and he said it was it was like his mother and a vision and he said there was a great big man and he said he had a stick and he was he was going to hit her and he was yelling at her and brother branham said i was just i was just uh you know troubled and endowed and in fear and uh and brother branham said that stick was the triune uh trinity and he said he was just trying to beat the church down with the stick brother madam so all of a sudden at once i just said you ought not to do that and spoke against him brother branham says when i spoke he said i looked down and muscle started popping out brother adam said my arms grew bigger and he said i got bigger and stronger reminded me of the incredible hulk brother brad it's hard to be carnal but he said i got bigger and bigger and bigger and brother branham said that was that was the anointing of the lord to come and crush the enemy i thought of brother branham when he said moses mother and you ever know brother adam said that he said it over and over he said you know faith he said when when pharaoh sent out a decree to kill all the boys he said the mom he said had looked at that child and he said something struck her heart and he said and she knew this was a the promised child to come to be a deliverer brother branham says when she said that she said there was no more fear she didn't worry anymore she had faith to keep moving to take that baby brother and says you know why i said because faith has muscles faith has hair on its chest and he said and when faith speaks all the devils shut their mouths amen and i think a word of faith was spoken here tonight and the devil has to shut his mouth amen we're going to take up some more prayer requests brother brad i want you to pray i know you've been preaching and standing i want you to pray over this i mean these knees tonight i
