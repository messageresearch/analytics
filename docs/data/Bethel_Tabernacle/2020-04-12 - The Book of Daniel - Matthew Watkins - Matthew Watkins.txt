========================================

- the Word of God and if you if you study at all any historical commentary and you study commentary from different men who or even just have biblical based literature you read literature that's based on the Bible you'll find that there has been a shift now listen closer I don't want you to lose your hair is this the most important part there's been a shift in the way that biblical scholars of the past and the biblical scholars of today look at the Bible and what you'll find is if you study historical commentary or biblical literature you'll find that the change there's been a change that happened in our generation of the Bible and any literature surrounding the Bible in their attitude towards two categories miracles and prophecy and the way that has that biblical scholars now look at his history our miracles and prophecy is very different than how scholars or commentators of old did it's quite astounding when you really look at it and it's a telltale sign of something very important you see miracles and prophecies in the Bible used to be used as if you take out any miracle or any prophecy that you could name in the Bible Jonah being swallowed by the well Noah and the Ark Daniel and the Lions Den Shadrach and Meshach and Abednego and the fiery furnace where they go into a fire that was seven times hotter and they didn't get burnt not even a hair singe didn't even smell like the fire you take those miracles out of the Bible and miracles and prophecies used to be considered proofs of the inspiration of the Bible and many of you have you read many apologists for the Christian faith they would always used it they would use to look back and say look at the prophecies look at the miracles look at the prophetic things that have happened and and and it's proof that it's a divinely inspired book but it's amazing because nowadays biblical scholars shy away from any miracles speaking of miracles or prophecy in fact prophecy and miracles is considered a handicap in proving the validity of the Bible now in our age you say why is that you know most people today say well you know if you just cut out the miracles and you cut out all the prophecies I could believe a book like the Bible you know instead of instead of helping people to believe it's God's book it actually miracles and prophecies actually now to the modern world they hinder someone from believing the Bible think about this you're just here for a moment now today miracles and prophecies to people in the age we live in they don't help to get someone to understand that it's a divinely burrowed book now let hinders them but actually that's because you say brother Matt why is that because now we live in the scientific age and we live in an age where intellect has became supreme and Jesus said it would be this way that men would be lovers of their own self that's not getting the mirror and looking at your body or looking at your face and oh I'm so handsome and I'm so I'm so pretty if you're a woman the worship of self that Jesus is referring to is this worship the worship of man's thinking are you with me here so it's a scientific age that we live in and people deal with people so you ask how does science how does a scientific intellectual mind I'm talking about Christians here how does how does a scientific educated mind deal with miracles and prophecies well the miracles they treat them as fiction fable and you think I'm you thinking if you think I'm making this up today just go do some of your own study and read some modern biblical theology it's shocking now they have what they call textual variants and they they can't trust in the King James Bible anymore it's unreliable because there's textual variants and they've the NIV has deleted entire verses out of the book of Mark and the Book of Luke and it's a scientific age and they do you say how do they deal with miracles well miracles are just fiction rather than fact rather than an event that took place there these are myths and they category categorize them as tales or legends sort of like you take the the Greek gods of Zeus or they won't were that they were legends and fables you take the story of the Trojan horse or any of those any of those wives tales we call them or fables and this is how they treat they call the myths and legends you know they could say well there there may have been some you know maybe some when you look at the story of Daniel in the lion's den and Shadrach Meshach and Abednego and Jonah you know there may have been some kind of historical truth in them but really the way we should approach them because we're living in the modern age is we need to approach them more as these are just tells these are allegories and they give us good lessons of morality so the Bible can't be used as a historical fact of an event these stories that you read about we're just to glean from the moral of the story they that's how many people treat miracles of the Bible as tells with the moral and they treat prophecies as a record that was inserted after the event took place rather than a revelation that God gave to a prophet now we're sheltered from a lot of this because we're message believers and but and I'm just trying to get you to understand here be thankful for what you have be thankful for the revelation that you have because the entire world is groping in darkness and I'm speaking of the Christian world it's groping in darkness and gross darkness and it doesn't take very much time when I go to study us for a certain verse and I've got I'm weeding through everything the Prophet said about it going through all everything that the word says and if there's maybe some I want to get some added clarity to maybe a certain Greek quarter Hebrew word I go to certain resources that I use as brother branham use those also and we go to some of those resources and it's amazing to me sometimes I start looking at the way almost have to go back to men of a hundred years ago to get any pure thought because now the scientific age is so polluted the minds of men that they they just date a lit-up you face that here in our megachurch here in this city of where they just they they they they they can they they don't look at the biblical prophecies or miracles they say the days of miracles are past that God God's in sundry times spin that in days of past spoke to the prophets but now he's spoken through his son and there's no more apostolic gifts there's no more days of the Apostles is over we're not gonna get bogged down in that but I it's amazing because modern when you look at and what is is modern modern liberals modern liberal scholars who have really infiltrated the church because this was prophecy that this would take place and and they they they take these prophecies and what you find is what's amazing is when you go look at this to get the we're gonna run out of time but I want to get through this first part in particular when you study the Book of Daniel and chapter 11 when you come to Daniel chapter 11 Daniel 11 is the most vivid and detailed prophecies concerning future events that we have in the entire Bible there are other prophecies you see the Book of Revelations but the book of Revelation speaks in symbology and symbols and signs that needs interpreted but Daniel 11 go read it Daniel 11 is vivid specific very very very detail specific in fact there's over 200 specific details in Daniel 11 all of which happened centuries after Daniel passes away but all of which happened and you could google it you could go read the history and read the history books they happen centuries later so you say brother Matt what does that mean that either means that this is a book of man who's these are cunningly devised fables and a man has came in here and inserted these events after they took place to make it look like this was a divinely real book it's either that or it's a divinely revealed book and a person has to make that choice I choose to believe it's divinely inspired because the same the same Daniel he understands the prophecy of Jeremiah of 70 years in Babylonian captivity and we know that took place the seventy weeks of Daniel so put it up Isaiah chapter 46 if you don't if it's not ready that's fine but verse 9 and verse 10 notice what God says this is this is the this is why men have a log jam because they don't understand this about God Isaiah chapter 46 and verse 9 it says remember he says the former things of old for I am God not man that's what man tends to forget for I am God and there is none else I am God and there is none like me verse 10 he says in the next verse for the gorge he says declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times the things that are not yet done saying my counsel shall stand and I will do all my pleasure it's amazing to me how many of these people who look at this with this scientific modern approach even Christian scholars and they treat miracles and prophecies of the Bible in such a humanistic way but somehow they still want to keep the Bible somehow they still want to believe in the by which they just be honest and throw the whole thing out because if this is if any of this is man then all of it needs to be thrown out it's got to either be all God or none of God are you or your entire paradigm of God falls apart you got me and so well you know you can you can keep the moral and spiritual benefits from all those stores you don't have to believe that they were literal you could just keep all the moral and spiritual values and and and and just cut out all the miracles and keep the you know just they say just live by the Ten Commandments and the Sermon on the Mount I'm a good person that's all anything it's amazing how people will take that but they don't believe in miracles and prophecy they'll cut and splice and take portions of it because it fits into their historical understanding of Jesus but when you believe in miracles and prophecies you believe that he's the same yesterday today and forever and then that means you have to make a change in your life and people don't want to make changes you know what people can't believe in miracles and prophecy cuz they don't really believe in God because if they really believed in God they believed the scripture would is read in Isaiah but people they have no trouble except in a historical Sunday school Jesus they just have a log jam when you try to make him present today and relevant today right difference between religion and Revelation so there's a built-in reluctance in every human being there's something that's built into your system to accept anything to accept it to to agree with it with anything that's in a supernatural dimension now you're saved born by the Spirit of God and now you you it's part of your sixth sense you accept it but the fallen man the intellectual man how you were born you have a built-in reluctant reluctance or repelled it towards anything supernatural or understanding or believing anything or accepting anything in a supernatural dimension it's not just you look at scientism and it believes that we live in a closed planet and and a closed system and the only thing the only reality is that which can be put in the test tube and tested or taken with instruments and observed that's how science thinks they believe the only reality is what can be tests that are investigated so man always has a reluctance to believe in the supernatural now let's go to the book before we run out of time here Daniel the book of Daniel is in two halves two halves it's split into two halves and the first half of the Book of Daniel is mainly mostly all miracles and then the second half of Daniel the first half is chapter 1 through chapter 6 it's mostly all miracles and then the second half of Daniel chapter 7 through 12 is mostly all prophecy so you have these two categories in the Book of Daniel miracles and prophecy that's why people who don't believe in miracles are believed in prophecy they don't know what to do with the Book of Daniel because it's all miracles and prophecy the whole book is miracles in prophecy Daniel well Daniel was new you know Daniel the lines in yet happened but the lines had been fed you know right before Daniel went in there right and and so they they have a state they can't understand so I want I wanted this bring this here because it's so awesome to look at the first so the first if you read Daniel the first six chapters of Daniel are very easy to understand whereas the second half the last chapters are what you wouldn't even be more difficult to understand we all know the first six from sunday-school but most people are not familiar with the last six so the second seven to twelve are what we would call harder most people don't know it can't understand now some interesting facts this is amazing when I got to looking at this here and I won't get time to even get into it chapter as we said chapters 1 through 6 or mostly miracles chapter 7 through 12 is mostly prophecies now what's amazing is that chapters 1 through 6 are written in the third person chapter one through six Daniel he Daniel said and Daniel went and dent they're written in the third person but chapter 7 through 12 says I Daniel so the first six chapters are third person the last our first person Daniel I Daniel so you say for the Matt words that means it means the first six chapters are all about him and the second half is all by him so it's from Daniel so the first half of the Book of Daniel is everything that happens in Daniels life the second half of day of the Book of Daniel is everything that's going to happen after Daniels life prophecy and so some of it as we said has happened already a lot of it has happened already some of it is yet to come the first half is present the second half is future all history the most but you know the moment one of the most unusual differences that I found that's amazing is that the first half the first six chapters that you read in this book the first six chapters of this book and the second half so you have chapters you have chapter one through six and chapter seven through twelve and the first now you gotta listen closest this is going to confuse you you got two halves the first half the second half what's amazing is that the first chapter of the first half is written in the language of Hebrew the last five chapters of the first half is written in the language of Aramaic now when you go to the second half the first chapter is written in Aramaic and the last five are in Hebrew so it's not just as simple as dividing two halves there's actually something unique you see Aramaic was the was the I forget what they call that but it's the mother tongue it's the world it's the it's the tongue that everyone spoke Aramaic was the common language it was the one that everyone understood whereas the Hebrew tongue was only a selected people could understand that language so what does it say it says that there were certain portion wood tells me that there are certain portions of the book that was for the entire world to understand and to read and then there were certain parts Daniel wrote only for the Hebrews see for the mat what is that significance because there's certain portions of this book that the whole church world could see but then there's another language it's written in that only the bride can understand and so it tells you where the chapters were meant to be read they were both they were directed towards two classes or two different groups so you can tell which parts are meant to be read widely and understood and which parts now let's get to some historical background in the last two minutes by the kid I'm hurryin give me two minutes the historical background is Babylon we know that city very well what's important to understand is that the children of Israel when they were taken out of the promised land and brought into captivity in exile they were not all taken in one time we taught on this before we're gonna cover it here again it's important the they were not all taken at one time but they were they they they were in exile they weren't taking all at the same time and they also were not brought back to Jerusalem at that we're all together so when you read if you study the records carefully in the books of Ezra and Nehemiah and you read about Zerubbabel and Ezra and Nehemiah when you read them carefully you'll understand that they were taken in three different deportations three different times and they come back also in three different returns there's three different returns but the total number that comes back to Jerusalem is much smaller than the total number that went to Babylon and in fact they left behind when it was all said and done they left behind a massive Jewish community in Babylon that never returned only up until a few years ago until recently there was a community Jewish community in in what we would call modern Babylon now we know there's a reason for that it's all prophetic it's all it's all part of Israel becoming a homeland becoming a nation again but notice in the times of Daniel they don't all come back together there's three different trips and there's also three different deportations so historically in these numbers you can write down the first deportation was in 606 it was the we call it the top layer of society it was all of the important people all of the nobles all of the key people and among that first deportation was some young men four of them Shadrach Meshach Abednego and Daniel and all four of these young men go back in that first deportation and these were these were these were outstanding excellent men of excellence Daniel was there was a reason why he gets to Babylon and he's successful because he was a man of excellence now we're gonna we're out of time here today so we're just gonna put a pause put the break let's stand to our feet eleven o'clock got a stop there Lord Jesus we thank you Father for this teaching this morning we ask Lord that you would bless the remainder of the service the singing Lord the worship father the ministry of your word may you to speak to us this morning we ask by your word in Jesus name you
