TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] you you good morning everyone god bless you let's stand and pray heavenly father we just come before you lord and we are so thankful for your goodness your mercy your grace that you give to us lord i pray that your holy spirit would just be upon each one of us now lord speaking and and teaching and and guiding our thoughts today lord we just submit surrender ourselves to you lord that you would be glorified in our lives we ask these things in jesus name amen amen i'm going to be starting a series on a book of acts church and you can go ahead and be seated in the sermon god has a provided lamb brother branham says and if the branch ever brings forth or a vine brings forth a branch it has grapes on it the next vine comes out or branch out of that vine will have grapes on it if the church that come off of that vine was a pentecostal church with all the gifts if that ever really puts out another branch they'll write another book of acts behind it and that's what they had in the days of the apostles and the apostolic age never ended amen i want to draw from that thought a book of acts church and maybe even expand on it a little bit look at it from a different angle not just looking at the gifts and the supernatural power of god though that's certainly a part of it brother joe my goodness it's good to see you here praise the lord amen [Applause] love you brother he's been through a lot but he's faithful amen amen in the sermon be not afraid i want to look at it a little bit from this angle and is what kind of character did the holy ghost produce in the book of acts not just looking at supernatural gifts but looking at the kind of life those men and women lived in the book of acts be not afraid 1960 brother branham says i've had ministers will say to me you better go see him because he's in an influential man in this city i love this i don't care if he's a bum in the street so drunk he can't move he's just as much as a mayor of the city in the sight of god because it's whosoever will let him come but we went after somebody else that was a movie star and had some great pull or some tap dance or a modern jitterbug or whatever you want to call it in other words brother branham's calling out the christian celebrity worship that took place then and how how much worse is it now everybody wants this celebrity this one's a christian tim tebow we're buying we'll buy his jerseys he's no good at football but we'll just buy his dirties because he's a celebrity christian um and you can go on and on and on all these celebrity christians and what does it amount to in the end seventy percent of the time it amounts to utter moral failure look at the story of ravi zacharias all of his sins exposed before the world an abuse a serial abuser of women that's not what it's about it's not about celebrity it's not not about the big shot it's about every soul and if we can't look and this is what brother branham's saying we can't look at the celebrity and the stinky bum on the street in the same way there's something wrong in our way of looking at it god goes to the gutters this is back to brother branham god goes to the gutters go out into the streets and highways and compel them to come in and remember that was the last call the church has gone off without him see you've gone off on tantrums a lot of things come to my mind when i read that a lot of things come to my mind i don't know if i should say them right now but let let me try to put this in a gentle way we and there's nothing wrong with that we're we're so focused in the message movement on special meetings that i fear that our young people that are aspiring to be preachers what are they are aspiring to is to be invited to be the preachers at special meetings and now we've reached the pinnacle i'm i'm preaching at a special meeting i'm i'm a pastor of a church i would that we would look at it this way and that our young people that are aspiring to do something for god would think how can i go to the gutters how can i go to the streets to preach the word of god you don't you don't need to preach in this pulpit to do great things for god you might do much better things for god out of this building it's needed but we the church has gone off without him i wonder not everyone not all of us i'm not trying to paint such a broad stroke across every single person and everyone but i wonder if we haven't thought about this very often and if we've not got completely gone off without him but if we've our focus has shifted to the wrong thing in the wrong direction we want to be preachers and pulpits we want to have a time to preach and wednesday and sunday you could preach literally every day somewhere people are literally coveting ministers to visit them and i know kovitz going on and yet and yet if god if god leads you and guides you there's a way to go anywhere pretty much and so it it's not about what the limitations are it's about the god that we serve and his calling upon our lives but i wonder if too many lives and great ministries have been wasted inside of a church because that's the only focus that's been placed is we've got to be a minister and i've got a minister inside of the church i don't believe you have to do that and i'm just these are questions that i'm asking myself are we looking for recognition from the message elite are we looking for recognition at all do we treat the dirty stinking drunk with the same heart as the great men of message society so god goes to the gutters how does god go to the gutters how does god go to the gutters we are the body of christ we are his hands his feet his heart are we ready to be the hands and feet and voice of jesus and go the places no one else wants to or have we gone on without god or are we making a purpose to go on without god again they're just questions all of us have to answer them as individuals i'm not talking about our church and the church body and our pastor i'm talking about all of us as individuals and i it i don't care how spiritual you are how born again you are you can still go on without god mary and joseph were chosen vessels and what did they do they went they went forward when jesus was 12 years old they went forward without him that didn't make them wicked sinners that made them in the wrong place going the wrong direction acts 4 17 17-20 let's look at the nature of these people that were filled with the holy ghost this is the sanhedrin council but it but that it spread no further among the people let us straightly threaten them that they speak henceforth to no man in this name how did that go for the sanhedrin council they called them commanded them not to speak at all or teach in the name of jesus but peter and john answered and said unto them whether it be right in the sight of god to hearken unto you more than unto god judgey for we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard now that's that's gutsy that's the kind of that's what that's a book of acts believer not a soft soap jellyfish someone that says whatever it takes even if it means my death i will serve and obey the calling that god has placed upon my life the authorities the big shot said you guys can't do that now they put their muscle behind that too right acts 55 17-21 then the high priest rose up and all they that were with him which is the sect of the sadducees and were filled with indignation and laid their hands on the apostles and put them in the common prison so they got arrested for preaching in the name of jesus and they got thrown in prison but the angel of the lord by night opened the prison doors and brought them forth and said go stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life so this is what the the lord spoke to them you just got out of jail he doesn't say go hide because they're coming after you he says go to the very place you arrested before stand and preach the words of this life what was their response when they heard that they entered into the temple late at night when it was dark and no one could see them and it was safer early in the morning and taught but the high priest came and they that were with them and called the council together and all the senate are the children of israel and sent to the prison to have them brought out they weren't there aren't these the guys that we arrested yep yeah they are but they really don't they're not counting their life as anything that's a book of acts church that's a book of acts believer they weren't waiting for the next special meeting they weren't looking they weren't looking for a great speaker to come no they were just being obedient they knew the people that listened to them preached said we these guys are ignorant and unlearned in other words they don't talk like a real rabbi but they saw their boldness and took note these ones had been with jesus they took what they had whatever they had and they completely gave it to christ for his glory no matter what the cost that is what jesus calls us to that is a book of acts holy ghost believer acts 40 through 42 acts 5 40-42 and to him they agreed and when they had called the apostles and beaten them called the apostles nice greeting come here and they beat them they commanded that they should not speak in the name of jesus and let them go and how did that go for them and they departed from the presence of the council rejoicing that they were for his name what did jesus tell them in the sermon on the mount i think we i think i need to turn there take me a second to find it but matthew chapter 5. yeah verse 10 blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake for theirs is the kingdom of heaven blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake rejoice and be exceeding glad for great is your ward in heaven for so persecuted they the prophets that were before you rejoice rejoice when you're persecuted that should be our that should be our reaction that we we've been persecuted we've been put out and where is where are you usually persecuted and put out when you preach the word those who believe they have the word but are going against it and so it should not cause us to be sad or weepy in another place jesus says rejoice even he says leap for joy i mean think about that think about that for a second that's quite a reaction i mean when when that's like winning the nba championship right they leap and throw their fist in the air and shout for joy and so that should be not just uh let's see i'm persecuted jesus said i should leave for joy i'm just gonna leap for joy even though i don't know it's it's literally it should be a natural holy ghost reaction within us that i've stood for jesus christ i've been faithful to him and people are standing and fighting against me it should cause me to be joyful and it shouldn't stop me from doing what i'm supposed to do i think i think that's a great point and daily in the temple and in every house they ceased not to teach and preach jesus christ do what you're called to do and don't stop doing it it does you don't have you don't have to wait for someone to say hey here's the pulpit did they were they waiting for someone to say here's the pulpit sure okay so the situation is different we have churches etc i understand that portion of it but that doesn't this when i when i was a young minister in my early 20s i remember praying and feeling frustrated i'm sitting here why won't my pastor let me preach more often i wish i would have more opportunity to preach and the holy spirit said why would you limit your ministry to these four walls i haven't called you to stay within these four walls and it really struck me and convicted me when i heard that don't stop if he's called you to teach and preach jesus christ don't stop doing it don't wait for someone else to give you permission that these they didn't wait for permission do it brother branham says if you don't have a pulpit get one put it on the street start a bible study in your home with go to the go to the gutters go to the homeless people and witness to them preach to them don't don't wait there's how many people haven't heard there's nations there's entire nations there's not one message translated from brother branham or even printed or even preached a message by a message believer has never been preached in nations in this world what are we sitting here for they say there's covet okay if god calls you you'll go when you're supposed to go and where you're supposed to go and nothing's going to stop you you say the government can stop me and throw me in jail temporarily again this is a book of acts holy ghost church it's not just supernatural in special meetings we have a special meeting and people are healed and this no it's these when did they have a special meeting they were on the street they went to the temple in public places what is the last call brother brother branham told us the last call go into the highways and the hedges and compel them acts 15 25-26 it seemed good unto us being assembled with one accord to send chosen men unto you with our beloved barnabas and paul listen to this next portion about barnabas and paul men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our lord jesus christ amen lord help us i think that's that's called that's all of us it isn't just for barnabas and paul all of us all of us should stand for the gospel in season and out of season whether we're hated or loved it shouldn't matter we're not living for a pat on the back we're living for one pat on the back that's when we go to heaven for jesus to say well done thou good and faithful servant you might be rejected you might be rejected constantly for the sake of the gospel jesus christ is your portion men that have hazarded their lives for the name of the lord jesus christ acts 20 22 through 24 and now behold paul speaking to the elders of in ephesus and now behold i go bound in the spirit unto jerusalem not knowing the things that shall befall me there listen to this i'm going to jerusalem god called him to go to jerusalem he was being obedient to go to jerusalem but this is what every city is happening save that the holy ghost witnesses in every city saying that bonds and afflictions abide me or wait for me then what does he say next so therefore i'm gonna run to spain because it's too dangerous to go to jerusalem no but none of these things move me none of these things move me they don't change me from being obedient to what the lord has called me to neither kind count i my life dear unto myself wow it's easy to say oh yeah i don't count my we all i feel like we most of us count our life dear and to ourselves and we have to be careful because we're not living we're lit we're called to be stewards right we're called to multiply the blessings that god gives to us in in many different ways we're called to be excellent in everything we we do to be obedient in everything we do and yet we're not called to make that our focus and our hope we should say i don't count any of that dear to me what i'd count there is my character and being obedient and being a good steward of what god has entrusted me with but that stuff it doesn't mean anything to me give it up i'll give it up now if the lord asked me to neither count i my life dear unto myself so that i might finish my course with joy and the ministry which i have received of the lord jesus to testify the gospel of the grace of god you say brother jason we're in a different age we're not under that age they were called to persecution and difficulties and trials that's right but are we called to a different character we're supposed to be soft soap a bunch of sissified christians is that what we're supposed to be no we're supposed to be called with the same character we don't do what we do for recognition about from others we don't do what we do so that others will speak well of us jesus says woe unto you when all men speak well of you for so did they the false of the false prophets before you again it's a character issue it's not a situational issue you say we're not going to be persecuted we're not some people in the bride of christ today are persecuted it's not all about you in america or me in america there's people in iran there's people in turkey there's people in china and the list goes on who are gravely persecuted they're in prison so it's not about age or situation it's about the kind of character that the spirit of god is to produce within us we're not to be soft we're not to be weak we're to be witnesses and the holy ghost coming upon upon us gives us power to be witnesses and it gives us boldness that doesn't mean we don't have to pray for boldness paul asked wrote letters and asked people pray that i would have boldness to be a witness of the grace of god and so that that is for that is for all of us we need to pray for that we we sometimes we have shortcomings we we fail that's what the blood of christ is for to forgive us but don't just stay in the same position don't linger in weakness and fear we're called we're called to have a boldness we're called to be witnesses we're called to not be so concerned about what people think of us but to be concerned what jesus christ thinks of us amen how many want to be a book of acts believer i want to be a book of acts believer i want to have the character that god produced in those meant fearless that doesn't that doesn't mean there isn't you feel fear but you don't act upon your fear you don't well i'm scared so i adjust my life to avoid all difficulties and trials that's not the christian life that's not the christian walk often times the christian walk takes you to counter intuitive places calls you to do things that make no sense it causes you to give or spend money or spend time on things that zap you you see memes i'm only going to spend time think on things that add something to me okay that's the bible of satan we're called i'm gonna i'm gonna only do things that add to others that's what christianity is and in adding to others god will add to me but if my focus is on that last part it's not right god will add to you but if your heart is on yourself you you put a block on the blessings that are flowing you were created to live for others for your spouse for your children for the church for the bum on the street for the person that stinks the person that annoys you the person that gets on your nerves we're called to say i'm putting all that aside i'm putting my frustrations aside i'm putting my anger aside i'm putting my bad attitudes aside and i'm going to serve the person people that don't like me that don't treat me right because i'm not i'm not made for myself i'm not made to be a sissified christian that follows the easy path what did what was it that brother bran the the message in tongues was spoken to brother branham because you have chosen the hard way there was two paths in front of brother branham the hard way and the easy way i mean think about think about what his ministry the the money that his ministry died when he died there was millions that went on to brother billy paul brother branham could have built a huge auditorium in tucson and in jeffersonville and he could have just traveled back between there and it would have been full completely full and life would have been easy for brother branham he had nice office big staff he never chose that he actively you know he didn't even talk about this aspect right this is reading between the lines he chose the hard way and the lord told them this is my way oh the other ministers of that time they chose the easy way the way that seems most logical business-wise brother branham took the opposite direction and what did he do because of that what was it tremendous blessing awaited him where now no in heaven that we're not living for today sometimes we gotta remember that we're not living for temporary blessings lay up your treasures in heaven right it's a hundred fold if we if we jesus said if you leave everything father mother everything in this life you'll receive a hundred fold in the life to come you know what that is and the interest rate is ten thousand percent so what if i told you you could invest your money your time your energy into something that pays ten thousand percent you'd say sign me up i want it right now yep you can you you have access to that just have to start making deposits and you'll get all of it plus ten thousand percent in heaven amen let's stand and pray heavenly father we're so thankful for your grace lord we we want to be bold book of acts believers that we don't count our life as anything we don't count it dear to ourselves that but that we want to finish our course with joy thank you lord thank you for the joy that comes in times that should be painful thank you for that lord i pray your blessing upon each one under the sound of my voice may they experience that joy of being in the channel that you've called them to be in of of walking in boldness of being a witness being a book of acts church lord we ask these things in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you
