first two the third one you can work on it at home praise the Lord love the Lord this morning you got burden on your heart just to get closer to God and those that you rub shoulders with my goodness you know I was talking to somebody she wouldn't want me to say that but Melissa is a witnessing tool wherever she goes rubs shoulders with people she works with they always come to her for prayer they always come to her and I met a man that I was working for and I was just like say something bye I prayed for him but I didn't say nothing at the moment but um anyway everywhere she's worked they've always um they knew she was a Christian amen that's what I would want wherever I go that they would know that there was something in me that was different from the rest of the world let's pray father I love you this morning and I thank you for your grace and mercy I thank you for your encouragement your inspiration father and Lord we thank you for your presence this morning we didn't come to see each other though we love each other Lord and we rub shoulders with each other edify each other the Lord would come to see you this morning Lord as our brother brought a Sunday school lesson father without that seed without your presence we're not going to go anywhere father but we're thankful Lord that you spoke that word in the beginning and you keep it still today bless you people bless the tithes and offerings Lord we lift you up worship you in spirit and in truth remember those that had burdens upon their hearts this morning remember our children father how we think of them often how we want them sitting right next to us in the house of God full of the Holy Ghost sealed until the day of redemption that's a parent's desire father and I'm sure it's your desire we love you this

amen you want to create an atmosphere for the Lord to feel welcome amen how many want to create an happiness first say Lord I want you to feel welcome amen we had a quite a time I won't take any time to tell it today but quite a time in in Israel and it was incredible to me to watch the Jews how that they even when they're reading the Bible for the reading Victoria they're they're doing something called chuckling so that you've seen them do this constantly when they're reading when they're praying so I thought why do they do that when you look it up the reason is is because David said with my body not just with my mouth but with my whole body that this they believe that the soul is like a is like a candle and if you ever light a candle it doesn't stay straight it moves the whole time it's an active Dynamic flame and so they believe that worship to God should be an active Dynamic movement where you surrender not just your voice you might not even have a very good voice today but that's all right Make a Joyful Noise to the Lord and it's not a Joyful Noise isn't just what you do with your vocal cords it's what you do with your whole body I just want to raise my hand how many can do it with me say Lord I Surrender my whole vessel to you and they're going to move Beyond this Dimension move into another world and let the angels of God minister to us this morning water you turned into

say that amen you're a great blessing to me we want to find our place this morning in the gospel of Matthew we're going to go and continue on Matthew chapter 12 where we a part of what we read at least last week we're continuing on in our series rebuilding Eden this should be part fours I believe we're just going to catch a couple of verses here last time we started in verse 38 this time we'll just start and catch verse 41. and 42. Brother Don you have to stop doing that brother Amen Brother Don texted me last night as he often does and let me know he was praying and Brother Don is such a praying man has learned over the years how to break into another atmosphere when I got up this morning wow it's like the heavens were opened and Brother Don wrote to me again and I wrote back to him to say Brother Don you know the Lord is because that was his prayer the Lord would even break with even fresh and I I went to bed Saturday night thinking I had all my notes lined up nope my the heavens exploded amen and just a deluge and uh and then he had the nerve to write back again and say well I'm going to keep praying for more so Amen in his humble way I said I'm sure brother Jason others are praying also and I'm quite sure that's true amen so you you pray for me continue please that I can bring this I want to join this service to the last installment with just one or two statements and then we're gonna go forward from there Matthew chapter 12 just watching my starting time I'll be careful in studious today just keep me give me your undivided attention for just a little bit and then we will hit a pause button Matthew chapter 12 verses 41 and 42. amen the men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation and shall condemn it because they repented at the preaching of Jonas and behold a greater than Jonas is here the queen of the South shall rise up in the Judgment with this generation and shall condemn it for she came from the uttermost parts of the Earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon and behold a greater than Solomon is here let's pray father we stand here this morning quite unworthy Lord as vessels but it's your doing it's your choosing all we can do is humble ourselves Lord before your presence this morning and we do so and as a prophet would say humble yourself he said I I humbled myself and then I humbled myself again Lord and I I seek to come to this Pulpit humbly but yet I never step onto the platform without I humble myself again Lord and I stand here in the pulpit and read your word I humble myself again father how do I humble myself by realizing how very unworthy I am to stand here and if it were not for you none of us could stand here this morning and receive the things of God if it were not for you Lord if it were not for your vision and your plan and that day on Calvary and what you accomplished Lord if you hadn't have stepped forward from the eternities to claim the book lord none of this would even be possible today we would just simply be uh an extended time version of the former Revival that came in the early part of the 20th century we'd just be Lord uh no doubt a steep degradation of that and uh and um and and twisted away into chaos Lord but you came forward you took the book you opened and loosed the word to us and so today we stand here Lord as though we never sinned in the first place we're standing here the this morning Lord worthy in Christ because of you so Lord now come and take your word break it to us Lord It's the bread of life help me be with my heart and mind Lord I I have trusted that that I know the word Lord must come from a clean vessel and I have laid before you Lord and I have pled your blood over my entire life Lord God May every man and woman boy and girl in this building do the same fresh this morning that they may receive the word of life it must come with into clean hearts and clean minds and people who wish to to be the image of Christ in the earth Lord that's a great desire that we have I pray that you will grant us a fresh filling of your Holy Spirit this morning in Jesus name amen God bless you friends you can be seated that may seem like a bizarre way to pray but the further I go the longer I live the more I preach the more I realize how what God has called us to friends and I can tell you we're not just a church on the corner I never wanted first of all I always told the Lord when I argued against ever being a pastor and if you you might imagine say you argued with the Lord that might seem hard for you to believe but I did for years and and but I've but I would also say but if I ever do if I ever do become that I have no idea what my future holds but if I ever do I knew that I wouldn't want to preside over just another church on the corner I I wanted to be something more Hallelujah is that your desire today amen well I'm I'm here to say congratulations God has given us the more he's given us the wherewithal to not just do more but to be more amen so last time and I'm just going to have to go right into it uh um and we just want to be in prayer for a number of families still traveling I know there's a number over in Georgia who went for the services in the concert there and I was watching some of that last night and so I want to be praying for them brother Steve sister Emily on the road headed this way also and other different ones I'm sure who are out of town today amen who um who aren't here but I'm sure that the Lord is with them as well all right so last time we had concluded and as we came down in our in what we were trying to deliver is we we we ended up at the point where we were explaining to you how that yet you remember that when Eve committed the transgression that she committed that she knew as brother Branham said when she laid her head her poor little Eve as brother Branham called her poor little Eve his sweetheart his his darling and and they were sweethearts and she laid her poor little head over on his shoulder weeping and crying and saying it was all my fault it's all my fault and but but we realized that from the scripture and that's from Brother Branham dramatizing it as as few could do like brother Branham and he but brother Branham goes on to show and explain that that to remember what the Bible teaching was that Eve did that under a deception Eve never thought she was wrong if brother Branham says it over and over and over and over and over she thought she was doing right she thought it was a good thing she brought it to Adam with joy look at what I have discovered look at what is possible of course Adam being a Son of God being the Son of God was not fooled by that he knew immediately that it was a violation of God's word he he and he also knew immediately that she was doomed without remedy he also knew immediately that if she was going to be saved and he was determined she was going to be saved that if it was going to happen he would have to save her and he already knew how it would have to be he knew that he would have to partake of the same transgression with his eyes wide open see because that's what Sin is Sin you know you sin well that's what iniquity is that you actually know it's wrong and you do it anyway but he did it in a portrayal of Christ who also took your and my sin upon himself he who knew no sin the Bible doesn't say he who knew no sin committed sin said he who knew no sin became so he took your sin upon himself oh my thank you sir he took your sin he took our sin and became guilty of our sin just like Adam the the problem was that when Adam as I've said before that when Adam stepped into death to save Eve he got trapped himself he could not bring himself there was there had been as brother Branham said there had been uh from from from the resurrection of Christ the death and Barrel of Jesus that day on Calvary brother Branham said in the Rising Sun there had been many men noble men who had died and many of them had died for a very good cause but there had there had never been someone who could die and raise himself back up again so whereas Adam couldn't bring himself out of Death Christ was able to step into death for you and me and then turn around and pull you out with him and this is the beauty of that day on Calvary this is the beauty of Resurrection morning brother Branham said there had never been a morning like that morning because it answered the question if a man died can he live again it answered the question of what's next and what's beyond and and we find out that that you know the even the even the sacrificial lamb would have to be judged of sin and he would have to be condemned and he would have to be sent to hell that's what David uh shows and that's what happened to Jesus brother Branham said he was he was convicted and God judged him as a sinner and sent him to hell but David also knew under inspiration hell couldn't hold him the grave couldn't hold him he'll not leave my soul in hell and neither will he suffer his holy one to see corruption and so brother Branham said there had never been a morning like that and that's why we have today the answer or sometimes a better way to understand it we have the answer to the devil's challenge brother Branham said we have the answer to his question the question was a challenge that you know several things if a man died could he live again but but but is it the word that Satan was saying is it the word that's the challenge can you prove that it's the word that can overcome everything and that's what Jesus proved so we have today the answer to the devil's challenge yes you can be free yes you can be a child of God yes you can be redeemed nothing can keep you from it there's not enough devils in hell they who believe have become New Creation we have the devil's answer I am the devil's answer to the challenge as are you oh we are to rejoice in that this morning you are the answer to his challenge don't let him push you around don't let him threaten you don't let him threaten you with your children or your family you have the answer Hallelujah you have an insurmountable weapon an Unstoppable weapon Hallelujah and so we find that that when Eve came remember as we were saying last time so so you know brother Branham says over and over that she thought she was right so when the serpent now follow me real close I'm just building Foundation right now you good so when the serpent brought her this knowledge she was none the wiser she still didn't know she didn't know she was naked she hadn't she didn't know anything what he did didn't break the world because she couldn't break it see so she was none the wiser she still didn't realize what had happened she's still thinking it's a good thing and without any hesitation she brings it right to her husband and tells her see so she's living under a great deception but when Adam catch it now when Adam brought the same knowledge to her she understood at that moment that she was now in a fallen and sinful condition I'm here to tell you friends and that's where we ended last time it took the second Adam if if that took the first Adam to show the first Eve it took the second Adam to move upon you and me and show us I'm wrong I'm undone I'm in sin Hallelujah there is no way for us to know it a man can't know it that's that's that's exactly where the new birth begins is to say I'm wrong I'm lost you can't get a man I remember brother Glenn Miller former Pastor from back in the day made a statement my young heart held on to that I never forgot it he said you cannot convince a man to re to to be saved unless you can first show him he's lost you can't get him to repent unless you can show him he's wrong see and so it takes the Holy Spirit it took the second Adam to move upon us to show us that we were undone and when it did it produced It produced Now Catch what happened that when Adam brought that same knowledge to her It produced for the first time the tree of knowledge and the Tree of Life standing side by side in the earth now both of them are in flesh in a form the serpent isn't Lucifer he's the vicarious way Satan sowed unbelief into God's family and and therefore that's why even children of God are born in sin because we come through the wrong way we come through a violation of the word into life so even though we have a gene of God we still have to be born again you see and so we realized that that It produced it once again that's a very sharp distinction because the tree of life and when I say the tree of life I'm meaning it in the sense of now you've got a uh a Christ seed line see enable and you've got a seed line of the serpent seed and they're standing Cain and Abel side by side so you get me I don't want to lose you in the in the and you get lost in the wording so it's a sharp distinction because it brother Branham had showed that it would have to come forth in flesh see because when the Tree of Life brother and shows us in the tree in in the Garden of Eden that the Tree of Life hadn't become it couldn't be directly partaken of because it hadn't become flesh yet see but now you've got actually the the tree of knowledge standing and It produced a human and the seed line through Adam now you've got Abel and they're twins same mom two different dads that's why the Bible says Eve is the mother of all living but it never says Adam is the father of all living because it can't say that all right I'm trying to go slow so I don't lose you in the shuffle so so it would and you have to understand that it would this was going to be necessary he he had the Tree of Life hadn't become flesh yet it would it would have it would have come forth you know in flesh in fact is that's why brother Branham said eve ran ahead of the Lord that she would have finally become a mother she would and Christ would have been the child she would have had you understand so it would have come forth in flesh to do what to build the perfect image of what the coming Kingdom would be does that make sense because it's just starting out it's just two people in a garden in the whole earth but God's got a vision of an entire economy an entire Kingdom of saint that will fulfill the universe you see so so he's he's got in mind what they're going to look like say well he had it in Adam why didn't he just leave it like he had it because Adam because if he left it like that with no fall then the Redeemer part that was in God could never be fulfilled he would never get to redeem anyone he would never get to heal anyone he would never get to justify anyone but it was in his heart to not have a kingdom of Androids or robots or just people who are born he wanted people in His image to choose him clean any romance I you know I wanted my wife to choose me to choose me against all the other billions of men in the earth when I open a ring box I I'm asking her will you choose me see I've chosen you will you choose me that's what a proposal is no wonder it should be till death do us part that's God's image so so it would it would come forth see it would have come forth Christ would have come forth to build the perfect image of what the kingdom of God would be but it had to be a redeemed family I think you're with me I can feel it so it had to go through remember we're preaching on rebuilding Eden so it had to go through a fall and be redeemed to satisfy that part of God that had called for a redeemer I can't get sidetracked on it today but that that's that same anointing what's is what fell on a prophet during the time of the opening of the seals when he's calling for a redeemer a worthy one to take the book and it's got to skip it because if I if I go there we'll get lost so now we've got Adam and Eve now you've got Cain and Abel now you've got the tree of knowledge and flesh and the Tree of Life in flesh going forward and you can see the difference in their natures you can see that one they're both sincere they both go to church they both bring their offerings and and and Cain is not bringing a facetious offering he's not faking it he's sincere he's trying to worship God see so so so but but the difference is is that he when his when his way because you can only come God's provided way I mean if God is the Redeemer why wouldn't you have to come his way good grief why would if he's the Redeemer why do you get to choose if he's the Creator and he's the one who's going to pay the price I would imagine he has the right to choose the way you get redeemed he has the right to choose what offerings are acceptable to him and what offerings are not even if you bring them in sincerity he's just going to tell you that's that's not the offering for what you're after that what Cain actually brought would actually was part of a a sacrificial of grain and things that they would bring grain offerings and different things but that not for Redemption that wasn't the offering for Redemption for Redemption on in Leviticus it had to be blood see you couldn't bring your grain offering for that so so we find that that now he you've got two boys and one of them is resistant and you know both boys I'm gonna say it like this both boys are savable but only one is redeemable because because only the elected are considered in predestination see now both are savable but not but only one of them is redeemable because only one of them is the is the line the seed line of the Tree of Life right so so we find that now now you come fast forward 4 000 years so just fast forward 4 000 years to Resurrection morning and that's exactly why when he finally when when he finally did come forth on Resurrection morning then he now he's in a position to ascend from a Mountaintop and say all power in Heaven and Earth is given unto me this is why Peter could say God hath made that same Jesus whom you crucified he couldn't just he couldn't go to Calvary at 12. he could debate with the doctors of divinity but he wasn't ready for Calvary he couldn't come out of the water at 30 and go to Calvary he had to go into the Wilderness and suffer the Temptations the pride of life and the lust of the eye or everything that you would ever have to go through he had to overcome it by the word and then he had to live and he had to go about his life and do always always always that means never not he always did that which pleased the father that was for your sake and my saying see and and then he had to Die the seed had to get they wanted to make him a king he said well I've got to be portrayed and crucified that be far from the Lord get me behind me Satan the cup my father has given me shall I not drink it are you kidding I came for this cause came out into the Earth that whoever would believe on me would never die and unless unless the corn of wheat die and abideth alone you Brothers as brother Daryl was saying you brothers who are gathered around the campfire with me none of y'all can go where I'm going if I don't die but if I die and go and prepare a place then you can be where I am oh my so that's exact so then so then once you go through that whole process of of life and he's born in a manger in a stable of hay and he's he's not exactly the he's neither the blood of June or Gentile Joseph is not genetically his dad at Mary's not genetically his mom but she does provide the nutrients through the placenta into the fetus to grow his body and so that's why he's a human because he's built his bodies built from the cursed Earth that's why he could age that's why he could get sick that's why he could have a headache that's why he could say oh you'll look at me and say physician heal yourself because he's standing there sick trying to preach you understand that's why he could be killed you can't kill God and once Jesus rose glorified he dieth no more you understand so this is the only phase that God can brother Branham said God acted the part of death in Christ he said he did die he really did die but God couldn't die so God acted out death in a drama through Christ he's doing the same thing through you though you were dead yet shall you live and that same God is living again in his body in the Earth oh my so so this is exactly why 4 000 years later on Resurrection morning when he when he finally did come forth on Resurrection morning now Paul can write to the Hebrews in chapter five so also Christ glorified not himself to be made a high priest but he that said unto him Thou Art my son today at the resurrection I have begotten thee because you've went through the whole process you kept every word you lived it perfectly you gave your life on a tree you were cursed of all men you went down into hell and I resurrected you out of hell and you've lifted up upon the Earth and now today at Resurrection morning I have begotten thee today Thou Art my son today I have begotten thee it's the full cycle of the family coming forth in a body it's Christ Living in the full word [Applause] tea so in Christ so in Christ going down through death burial and Resurrection so Christ on Resurrection morning is now the the elected son of Isaiah 42 and 1. he's now the elected son in a prototype of what the whole family is going to be he was the beginning of the creation of God not just the one born in a manger the Nazarene who walked the shores of Galilee who went about doing good no the the one who went through all of that process who kept every word who sacrificed his life who went to hell who came up out of hell who resurrected in their glorified State now I have begotten thee Thou Art my son and that's exactly why verse 6 he could say thou art a priests Forever After the order of milk because why he's now a prototype of the entire family that's what you're coming to that's what I'm coming to one of these mornings my brother The Trumpet Of God shall sound the dead in Christ shall rise and we which are alive and remain shall be changed in a moment caught up together with them I I can't explain it any clearer I hope you're getting it see so Christ the elected son standing there with the characteristic of God to be a redeemer now fully satisfied forever thou art a priest Forever After the order of Melchizedek you Christ nor your bride will ever have to die because your life is an intercession forever you are you are redeemed my my penalty of my of my own law I suffered myself as well this is what God is saying I suffered In the Flesh for you now we can be together and nobody can bring an accusation against them which are in Christ Jesus understand why you can't be indicted you can't be words you can't be guilty you're free forever oh my two distinct Vines of humanity going forth into the world the Christ seed the seed of the woman and the serpent seed as Jesus would call them the children of the wicked one who Lord who sowed the tares the devil what was the field the Earth who are the wheat the children of the Kingdom who was the sower the son of man who sowed the tares the devil see so two lines their two seed lines would fill the Earth both are a byproduct of sin both of them these two men Cain and Abel are both a byproduct of sin every child that would be born going forward Abel's going to get murdered God's going to replace him with Seth and from there on he's going to run the line all the way out to Noah through Enoch through Methuselah and Enoch and into Noah and then from Noah through Shem to Abraham right amen and then all to on to Moses see God's got this whole thing choreographed it's beautiful it's like a ballet it's just it's so fluid it just is moving the devil's running all around trying to do everything and Pharaoh this and the Babylonians isn't everybody and God's just flowing it it's a masterpiece it's a piece of art it's a piece of music he's just playing it the devil's getting played and and and he doesn't even realize that God is just perfecting his family what is he doing he's showing a piece of himself and every one of those men so that when Jesus stood on the earth he was ever the last one of them oh my goodness wow and so so we find that both of them are byproduct of sin both as I said before both are savable but only one is redeemable and and the one that's redeemable is redeemable because yes he's a byproduct of sin but there's a hidden deposit down inside of him there's another as brother Branham said I found out that I'm not the son of Charles and Ella that other one there's another William Branham down inside of me that wasn't the son the son Charles and Ella Brandon the one that was the son of Charles and Ella Brandon was a sinner who ran from God but I found out there was another William Branham who was not the son of Charles and Ella Branham who was who had his lineage in Christ at Calvary and all the way back to the Garden of Eden that's what your new birth is about it's rebuilding Eden he can't rebuild the place till he rebuilds you and brother Branham said he redeems the Earth like he redeems his family oh my friends we would have had no clue how to Prophet not come in our day we would have had no way to know this kind of thing and see it put all together and find ourselves in the drama and I see my name and I have the Same Love Hallelujah oh my so we find that that one of them is redeemable though he's a byproduct of sin he has a hidden deposit he there's another Abel who's not not the son of Adam and Eve see there's another one called Seth and Seth is not the son exactly he's not only the son of Adam and Eve Cain couldn't receive it he refused to follow it he had the choice he could have God wasn't being facetious when he offered it to him God wasn't trying to trick him that was a legit offer you know Cain there's no Gene in you you didn't come from Adam you came from the Beast through a through a breach in the word by the by the by the devil talking to the serpent to your mother and you came wrong however I'm God and I create all life and I won't be defeated even for you and if you want to live I'll even find a way for you you're never going to be able to get the Revelation your brother because he has a different father but I'll save you anyway all you have to do is emulate him and just live just do whatever he tells you go to his church close your church close the doors and go to Abel's church and follow the word that he preaches and you'll find yourself at home Mercia oh to to the umpteenth degree and Abel and a Canaan his anger refused hey it came because God wouldn't accept his way and he was angry with murderous intent you see it today because we will not Abel wouldn't compromise on the word if Abel would have compromised then Cain could have said hey come on see and and if the world could just get us to compromise but we won't compromise I have no way I'm compromising and the world who thinks that they can live a compromised level of a born-again Believer but you can see in their life it's filled with carnality you see it in where they go what they do how they dress how they talk how they act you can see all and they but everybody wants to be a Christian everybody wants a version of Christianity that will let them live on the edge of carnality there's 33 000 versions of it but the real one don't allow that the real one does not allow that you you'll definitely for sure you mark my words on Resurrection morning you might have to face me we don't know how it'll all come out but I know this much you will never go in the Rapture until you have fully surrendered to every word of God and can say Amen to it a man in my home Amen in my life amen and my children Amen in every way you're going to have to you're going to have to do like Abel and say Amen to every word or you will be rejected doesn't matter that you said in a message Church you are born in the message had a message Pastor your whole life you'll miss the rapture we all make mistakes that's different it's different than an intentional disregard of God's word I make mistakes I Stumble and fall and have to repent thank God I can thank God we have an advocate but there's nothing in me to resist his word I want all of it I don't want any part of me to be like the world see this is what Abel craved Cain couldn't receive it Cain refused to follow it he wanted his own church version he wanted his own worship version he wanted his own sacrifice he refused to follow the opening of the word but Abel craved it Abel Abel like you and I Abel knew there there must be something higher than this than this life there's got to be you know there used to be a I hear I hear my parents and they they tell about that it's vague they're they're not exactly sure kind of like there was a garden kinda and they had this life and and they you know they didn't Abel son I'm sorry you've you've skinned your knee that you did that you didn't used to happen oh when did that oh well we don't know see brother Branham said that when they went out brother around says that when they God drove them out of the garden with an angel with a flaming sword now that's not a path it's not a geographical path it's the revelation of the tree of life it's a revelation of Christ because if they could get to that in a fallen condition they'd have eternal life in a falling condition and that would break the whole plan of God so he's got a Jesus was still standing there using the same flaming sword when he said except you eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life he's using the same sword to guard the same way that they can't understand that's terrible how dare you say that and they all walked away same brother Adam said he did that defend the crowd and so brother man said that when they were sent forth from this a paraphrase I don't have the quote in front of me but when they were sent forth from the garden that you know Adam had had the power like a like he was an amateur God he wasn't like one he was one and he could speak to the wind and brother Brandon would dramatize it as only an authoritative Prophet can and he would say he would say oh Adam that wind and he would say peace still thank you darling and Adam you know I would love to have a uh something right here but that tree's in the way it's beautiful can you tree uproot where do you want it sweetheart how about over here look lovely right there move over there and the tree I don't know how long it would take maybe instantly maybe it would pick itself up by its roots and walk over and re-dig itself into the ground I don't know you don't know we'll find out I'll understand it better by and by brother Brian said all the questions you ever had are going to be answered over there see and so he had this kind of power but brother Brandon shows that when God chased him from the garden and blocked the Revelation guarded the way he said Adam close as I can remember the quote Adam lost the Consciousness that he had ever had that kind of power he had other Avail came down a shroud came down over his memory over his Consciousness and brother Brandon said he law he he lost the Consciousness that he had ever had that kind of power or that they even ever had that kind of Life see so because because the angel with a flaming sword was guarding the way of their understanding and so it became vague it became mysterious it turned into a mystery of Christ now it's a now it's a mystery the tree of life became a sealed mystery you see but Abel there was something in in Abel that he that that that can't be the end of it there's something in him that like you you couldn't fully explain it and I even today being born again of the spirit I can tell you what God did to me but I can't fully explain it in language I just know I'm a new person and this is what they belong for there's got to be something more he's longing for Redemption that's you and me today we knew that this Mad World couldn't be all that there was there must be something more as brother lennial says then I heard recognizing your day serpent seed and perfect Faith the breach and the message of Grace and Lord I Thank thee Hallelujah just as it took the first Adam see just as it had taken the first Adam to make Eve realize her condition it took the second Adam to move upon us to help us to realize that we stood hopeless helpless to save ourselves it took just listen just now follow the types just as it took the first Adam to break the world I want that to soak I'm going to make two more statements you ready Satan couldn't do it want that to soak it it took the first Adam to break the Earth to collapse nature so that when he fell brother Brown says everything under him fell Satan couldn't break the world Eve the Bride of Adam couldn't break the world if you can believe it that's actually good news because since it took the first Adam to break it only the second Adam can fix it Hallelujah and when the second Adam fixes it just like Satan couldn't break it when the second Adam fixes it Satan can't stop it Hallelujah to stop the Plan of Redemption this mad world can't stop it corrupt politics can't stop it Hallelujah the Bride of Adam couldn't stop it the church can't stop it the false Church can't stop it there's not enough false churches not enough 33 000 to stop it just as Eve Adams brag couldn't break it your daily failures and my daily failures can't stop God [Applause] you cannot even destroy your own self Hallelujah because you are not the son of Earthly parents or a daughter of Earthly parents there's a Christ see down inside word amen it was marveling brother Matt's brother Matt Sunday school this morning my goodness oh what a thought but the man I want that research and wow all the findings why that just blew my mind what if we didn't have a prophet in this day oh you'd have to trust in science and they can't even figure their own self out see so just as Eve couldn't break it just as just as Eve couldn't change it you can't change it we are speeding toward a rapture and you can't you are going in a rapture and there's nothing you can do to stop it say brother Jason how is that even possible I'm like David psalm 16. I have set the Lord always before me because he is my right hand not because I'm superhuman because he is my right hand I shall not be moved always singing back in the day though all hell is sail me I shall not be moved Jesus will not fail me I shall not be moved just like a tree planted by the water I shall not be moved glory to God we ought to rejoice in that today oh Hallelujah that's the second Adam speaking from his throne it's the second Adam go to you look it up when you get home Revelation 21 it's the same place he was sitting in Genesis when he said let there be because before he'd just been a fountain an eternity brother Branham just said that great eternal spirit there's nothing you couldn't even see him he was no man hath seen God at any time see in that form he's unseeable so he condescends himself into a form brother REM says that little pillar of fight he says fire says I can see it just starting to whirl think of the atoms and molecules and things that had to go on and in physics and quantum physics and there's a there's a self creating self-sustaining ball of Fire and that's God and and because now he came from that great expanse and he condensed into a form now he takes the the title he's designated a title the son of God because he came from this into that not because he this was a separate person from this this had been this until he became this and in that form he starts creating see but but you first you first have God in Christ creating all things and now he speaks from his throne in in Revelation 21 uh and he says behold I make all a-l-l all things new I have the best possible news for you today I don't care what where you find yourself right now you may feel like the most unworthy it's only because you probably are you may feel completely there's no way to save yourself that's because you are but there's something down inside of you that doesn't want to stay like that and you want more I'm here to tell you I don't care what caused you to get there how you arrive there where you even are this morning the promise to you if you want it he said I will make all things I'll give you a new heart I'll give you a new mind I'll give you cleanness I'll give you gladness I'll pour upon you the oil of gladness I'll give you Joy for sorrow my Throne is established in Mercy why will you die as Jesus said why will you not come to me and live why will you die you don't have to oh friends could I could I act it out with more passion could I dramatize it in a greater way you don't have to die good news you don't have to die say I've got a weakness you don't have to keep it I got a problem it can be fixed I've got all kinds of baggage he'll take it from you Hallelujah he'll pour he'll pick you up out of the mire he'll sprinkle clean water on you and wash you and then he'll fill you full of his very life and you can be an offspring of the Tree of Life walking around in the Earth glory to God in the highest glory to God in the highest that's where we're at today friends that same one that spoke from his throne in Genesis the same one that spoke from his throne in Daniel the same one who spoke from his throne in Zachariah the same one who was seated in Revelation chapter four I saw one seated on the throne the same one after all Redemption is over and everything's finished and we're finally home and he's Seated on the throne again after he's after he was seen walking in the middle of the seven lampstands we find him back again and the end of it all when the tribulation the bride is gone the tribulation the 144 000 the Millennium that all Runs Out Satan tries to revolt God kills them all the Judgment bar everything is signed and sealed and delivered and a new city is ready to come and he says behold from his throne I make all things the beauty the beauty that it comes from his throne means that it's a Royal Decree and nobody can cancel it oh do you hear the King today speaking to you from his throne in glory come home child I'll save you I'll change you I'll protect you I'll grow you I'll give you a new world to live in a whole new life you'll be part of a family of God and I won't let anybody ever take it from you you'll go to a world with all this peace all is joy all the Fellowship of the Saints the whole world is full of godliness we're talking about it yesterday my wife and a sister there at the house and you know just the just the things that we have to go through just the things that we have to go through and rub shoulders with and God's ordained it that way he said that I've sent you out as as sheep among wolves stick close together love one another pray for one another these are instructions All Through the Bible all through the message Prophet says remember my warning now love one another above all things it's the greatest force on Earth see brother Branham says brother random says and I had a hard time reading this don't be angry ever don't ever be angry God help me

didn't get to cover it all how that that it took Adam it took Adam to show Eve she was wrong it took the second Adam to show us we were wrong it took the second Adam to fix what the first Adam broke
