========================================

good morning everyone may the Lord richly bless you thank you so much for tuning in online and for everyone being here just really really good to have more people here and looking forward as times go on for more fellowship with everyone we just definitely miss everybody very much so let's stand up and we'll pray gracious Heavenly Father we just come to you now Lord and we ask that your presence would be with us I pray Lord that you would give us all a spirit of wisdom and revelation and the knowledge of you Lord I pray that you would let your word come forth in clarity this morning and and that you would speak to hearts Lord and deal with hearts father we want to commit ourselves to you for your glory we ask it in the name of Jesus Christ amen god bless you you can be seated we're gonna continue on identifying the seed of the serpent part 2 and the scripture we're going to look at here is in Genesis chapter 1 and verse 26 through 28 actually let's just uh let's go to 27 and 28 so God created man in his own image and the image of God created he him male and female created he them and God blessed them and God said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth so that's God's command starts out is to multiply and fill up the earth then we go to Genesis 2 verse 9 and out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food and the Tree of Life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil okay so first God's commands multiply and replenish the earth and we always know when God gives a command he also gives a test so when they're cut when there comes a command there comes a test so the next thing we have is first thing we have is reproduction and the second thing we have is eating certain kinds of fruit two different kinds of fruit and again as we talked about last week a tree of life tree of the knowledge of good and evil immediately this should cause us to stop and say wait what's going on here why are we talking about trees that are good growing out of the ground and that are good for food and then we're talking about trees that are in the midst of the garden why why the difference in the language one growing out of the ground one in run one in the midst of the garden says nothing about growing out of the ground okay so then we go to genesis 3:15 and I will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel and then 16-under the woman he said I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband he shall rule over thee so three things we talked about this last week three things you can go to the next screen that's the wrong PowerPoint so three things we have Phillip the earth reproduction we had up all of a sudden there's there's the eating of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil then we're right back to two seeds two offspring being having enmity put against each other and then the next verse it says I will increase your pain and your conception so three things fit together one thing does not fit together what we're looking at literally if we want to say literal eating of the tree of knowledge if it's a literal fruit it's completely incongruous with the rest of the book of Genesis eating the wrong fruit but that in fact it was a sexual act of course of course the whole picture is talking about a sexual act then we have right in there a euphemism eating of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil so when we look at when we look at eating of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil we reviewed the scriptures last week such as the what proverbs 30 verse 20 I believe it was such as the way of an adulterous woman she eateth and why pethor mouth and say I have done no evil so eating of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil all these things fit perfectly together read through the book of solid Song of Solomon the picture is between Solomon and his bride and it's constantly talking about gardens fruit and eating so clear from Scripture that we're talking about a euphemism to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil we go to the next screen and once again scripture is very clear 2nd Corinthians 11 2 and 3 for I'm jealous over you with godly jealousy Paul writing for I have espoused you so there he's talking about engagement to be married I have espoused you to one husband and I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ but I fear lest by any means as the serpent beguiled Eve through subtility so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ next screen for if he that cometh preaches another jesus when we have not preached or if you receive another spirit which ye have not received or another gospel which you have not accepted you might well bear with him so Paul using a type he's saying here's the type Adam is engaged to Eve she's engaged as a virgin Christ is in great gauge to the church she's engaged in ver as a virgin and he's what does what is his fear his fear is that there would be a defilement of that virginity that's what he's afraid of and he likens that unto receiving a false Jesus a false gospel and a false spirit so what then did Paul assume the original sin was adultery that's what that's what he assumed that the original sin was when he was writing this verse you know go back one screen brother Joe so people will take that the serpent beguiled Eve and to us that's a connotation of adultery but if you look at the original word it simply speaks of being completely and utterly deceived so people will take that and say see you you message believers you don't know what you're talking this word has nothing to do with the sexual act well you're missing the point entirely the whole picture has to do with that it's not just one word that we're referencing to the whole picture that Paul is presenting and isn't this the picture that God brings to us all through the Bible God's relationship with his people is likened to a husband and a wife and when the wife becomes unfaithful in her faith turns to idols turns to other nations turns to false teaching God says you've committed adultery so that's the whole picture through the entire Bible but at the beginning of course it was just eating a fruit the the very first original sin is the type that's moving forward for God and His people that's the very first type now how are we gonna break that type where we're gonna say it was a literal peace an apple or an apricot pepperoni pizza it doesn't matter whatever it was it none of it makes any sense if you look at the the allegories in the Bible if you look at the picture in the Old Testament or in the book of Genesis none of it makes sense let's go to the next screen and next one one more church is engaged as a virgin to Christ eva's engaged as a virgin to Adam keep going paul fears the churches adultery by accepting a false word he compares that to the original sin if paul fears the church committing adultery and compares it to eve sin then we can conclude by the scripture that eve committed adultery with the serpent next one genesis 3:15 we read that but we'll read it again let's go back I will put enmity between thy seed if you look at the word seed there means offspring so thy offspring and her offspring very very clear there's two lines of offspring there's two necklines one is the seed of the serpent one is referred to as the seed of the woman we understand that this is ultimately a prophecy of Christ and His redemptive work we also understand that it had immediate application right away in Genesis between Cain and Abel so next screen here we see it and Cain talked with Abel his brother and it came to pass when they were in the field that Cain rose up against Abel his brother and slew him and then we skip ahead and Cain backs back and Cain knew his wife and she conceived and bare Enoch and he builded a city and called the name of the city after the name of his son Enoch and unto Enoch was born irad and irad begat booz yell and who's y'all beget with Susana the Jews al begat lamech and Lamech took unto Him two wives the name of the one was Adah and the name of the other Zillah so we see right there the serpent seed line they started civilization they started production they started polygamy the first ones to start polygamy it was not God it was the serpent seed line started polygamy next next one and ADA Bear Jabil he was the father of such as dwell in tents and such as have cattle and his brother's name was Jubal he was the father of all such as handle the harp in Oregon and Zillah she also bear tubal-cain and instructor of every artificer in brass and iron and the sister of tubal-cain was Naamah and Lamech said unto his wife Adah and Zillah hear my voice he wives of it laymen Lamech hearken unto my speech for I have slain a man to my wounding and a young man to my hurt if Cain shall be Avenged Sevenfold truly Lamech seventy and Sevenfold so there we see the birth of a tyrant so tyranny that's from the serpent seed line that's not from God's seed polygamy from the serpent seed line science civilization all these things of course they have their they have their proper application when done with and under the submission and authority of God's Word but outside of that submission we understand exactly what happened and what these things led to complete and total rebellion against God next screen John 8 verse 40 but now you seek to kill me a man hath told you the true truth which I have heard of God this did not Abraham you do the deeds of your father then said they to him we be not born of fornication we have one father even God so here we see Jesus go back there brother we see Jesus speaking to the Pharisees and he sees by their nature in how they respond to the word being manifested through him he says I see by your nature you're not doing the works of Abraham by your nature I can see who your father is and that's the devil and they they they understand what he's speaking about they know they know what he's saying and they right away say we're not born of fornication why in the world would they say that after he called said they were of their father the devil because it's a well well established fact it doesn't take much research at all to find out that Jewish people of this time believed that Cain was born of the devil and you know they have some misunderstandings within their teaching about that but ultimately they do not believe that Adam was the father of Cain and they do unfortunately at that time they did what many other what many current racist cults will do which is separate the seed lines only by race so the Jews viewed themselves as the pure race and everyone else was serpent seed just like white people would view themselves as the in in past and even today in sane people do now they view themselves of the pure race and anyone with any color is serpent seed there's people that believe that I've posted videos about certain serpent seed and had on YouTube and had racist people and congratulate me and immediately send them as a spam and it's just such nonsense that they want to believe this has nothing to do with that after after the sons of God saw the daughters of mine way ahead but just to clarify when the sons of God saw the daughters of men in those two genetic lines combined there ceased to be a pure serpent race that was that doesn't exist anymore everything comes through Noah and his wife and the the sons and daughters ham Shem and Japheth and their wives there's not somehow some pure serpent race somewhere it's all a mixed genetics all of our blood is perverted we're born wrong and that's why we have to be born again and so clearly the SERP they the Pharisees had an understanding what the original sin was they put it on fornication so next screen yeah John 8:44 you are of your father the devil and the lusts of your father he will do he was a murderer from the beginning and abode not in the truth because there's no truth in him when he speaks a lie he speaks of his own for he is the liar and the father of it so what what does Jesus it mean right here what is he referring to who was the one that told the first lie who was the one that committed the first murder it was Cain so what is he saying he's saying the father of Cain is the devil I mean I know I know this is simple to you but these things are not clear to everyone Jesus is saying that Satan produced Cain not God we understand when God's principles of life no matter no matter how evil the child would be the life has to come from God but it's God's principle that he's set forth in the human race to reproduce but but the spirit behind the birth of Cain was the devil and and again it was a literal not snake but an upright person that could speak that could reason that walked on two feet and Satan came and incarnated that serpent and through that physical instrumentality it wasn't a snake but an upright creature through that physical instrumentality together with Eve brought forth Cain next one first John 3:12 not as Cain who was of that wicked one and slew his brother and wherefore slew he him because his own works were evil and his brothers righteous alright so this verse is similar to that of the genealogies of Christ for instance in the book of Luke if you look closely in the Book of Luke were where they're going through the genealogies it will say the son of the son of the son of the son is in italics in the King James Version that means that that is added by the translators to make it to bring more sense to the verse so really what it says is of Abraham of Isaac so we hear in the same sense we see not as Cain who was of that wicked one so what can we assume right there the son of the wicked one and then next screen Matthew 13 37 through 39 he answered and said unto them he that soweth the good seed is the son of man the field is the world the good seed are the children of the kingdom but the tares are the children of the wicked one the enemy that sowed them is the devil the harvest is the end of the world and the Reapers are the Angels once again Jesus speaking about children of the devil next screen so let's look at this there in Jewish tradition this is this is a you can just see find this right on Wikipedia so in Jewish tradition Philo I mean these these people that I'm naming off our rabbis or philosophers that were Jewish people Philo perk to Rabbi Eliezer and the targum pseudo Jonathan asserted that Adam was not the father of cain rather Eve was subject to adultery haven't been seduced by either Samael the serpent in the Garden of Eden or the devil himself Christian eggs a Jesus of the evil one in first John 3 10 through 12 have also led some commentators like Tertullian to agree that cain was the son of the devil next screen so this is from Tertullian in the 3rd century from one of his writings he said he says having been made pregnant by the devil she brought forth a son so Jewish people had an understanding of serpent seed but also the early church had an understanding of serpent seed and as it as the church descended into darkness and false doctrine this understanding of the original sin was completely lost next screen Genesis 4:1 and Adam knew his wife and she conceived and bare Cain and said I have gotten a man from the Lord now this is one where people will always bring this verse and say Adam got together with Eve they produced Cain end of story serpent seed is a false doctrine so let's let's talk about that for a minute let's go to the next screen so English in English we have past tense present tense future tense in Hebrew they don't have those three tenses of verbs they have perfect and imperfect perfect means a completed action and imperfect means an action that's ongoing or an action that's in process so they also don't in in the original Hebrew text there's no punctuation none at all it's just a word although all the words running together and if you don't understand the tenses of Hebrew you don't know how to differentiate the thoughts so that's that's how we know that a new thought starts is when you have different tenses of the verbs so they're gonna go they're gonna go through and you're gonna look at that and they're gonna separate and put in punctuation based upon that in the King James you see it and Adam knew his wife and they put in a colon and she conceived and bare Cain if you look at some of the French translations they have a period there and Adam knew his wife period and then they start a new sentence and there's a reason for that let's continue on next screen an Adam this is this is how how it goes there in in that verse an Adam had known his wife so the first one and Adam knew his wife is a perfect tense it's a completed action but the next tenses are different and she was conceiving so it's a continuation it's changing the tense to an imperfect tense so Adam had known his wife and she was conceiving and she was bearing Cain next so let's look at this because the very similar language is used in two other verses here and it's important to understand it because it will bring us back to verse 1 and Cain knew his wife and she conceived and bare Enoch and he builded a city and called the name of the city after the name of his son you know very similar terminology the next one Cain was knowing his wife it doesn't say Cain had known so it's a different tense than what it is in Genesis 4 verse 1 Adam had known his wife here it is same tense and Cain was knowing his wife and she was conceiving and was bearing Enoch next one and Adam knew his wife again and she bare a son and called his name Seth for God said she hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel whom Cain slew again so here was it wasn't Adam had known it was Adam was knowing his wife again and she was bearing a son next going so Adam had known his wife she was conceiving and was bearing you see there the tenses are different so the thought is different the action the verb the action of II Adam knowing his wife is separated from the conception and bearing of Cain but when you talk about Cain and his wife both of the actions are connected when you talk about the birth of Seth both of the actions are connected but in Genesis 4 verse 1 they are disconnected his knowing his wife is talked about past tense finished a past tense perfect tense completed action the conception and burying of Cain is imperfect what is it doing it's clearly separating the two acts so that that anyone that could research this and study this and understand the action of Adam coming together with his wife is different than the conception and birth of Cain it is not connected together okay they're twins but the action is not connected together and the Bible never connects the birth of Cain so we take this verse we separate that out and we go run through the rest of Scripture no where is Cain included in the genealogy of Adam now that isn't because God is ashamed to put bad people in the genealogy because he goes to great detail about the sons of Abraham both both sides and the grandsons of Abraham Edom he goes into details about great detail about Edom God's on a shame a shame to do that to go into detail about a bad and wicked genealogy but he never connects Cain to Adam even in the verse that people that hate this message want to prove it wrong that they say it proves that Adam is the father of Cain it doesn't do any such thing it does the opposite it shows that there's a disconnection there and then we run through the rest of the scriptures and Cain is never connected to Adam so let's we'll close with that let's stand gracious Heavenly Father your word is true Lord we just stand in awe at the beauty of this vindicated mesh message that we've received Lord the word did not come out from us but it came to us Lord and we are recipients of that we ask that you just continue to quicken our hearts to the reality of this truth continue to open your word to us Lord make it live make it real within us father we ask your blessing upon the worship and upon the preaching of the word today may you be sovereign and move in people's lives Lord for your glory we ask it in Jesus name Amen god bless you
