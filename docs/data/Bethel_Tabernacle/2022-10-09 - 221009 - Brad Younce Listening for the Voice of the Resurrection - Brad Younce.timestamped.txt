[6:09] [Music]
[6:16] so verily verily I say unto you
[6:18] the hour is coming and now is when the
[6:21] dead shall hear the voice of the Son of
[6:24] God and they that hear shall live
[6:27] for as the father hath life in himself
[6:29] so hath he given to the son to have life
[6:33] in himself
[6:34] and has given him authority to execute
[6:37] judgment also because he is the son of
[6:40] man
[6:41] Marvel not at this for the hours coming
[6:44] in which all that are in the grave shall
[6:47] hear his voice and they shall come forth
[6:50] they that have done good unto the
[6:52] resurrection of life and they that have
[6:54] done evil unto the resurrection of them
[6:57] Nation now over in first Thessalonians 4
[7:00] 16
[7:01] you don't have to turn but very familiar
[7:03] for the Lord himself shall descend from
[7:06] heaven with a shout with the voice of
[7:08] the Archangel and with the Trump of God
[7:11] and the dead in Christ shall rise first
[7:13] then we which are alive and remain shall
[7:16] be caught up together with them in the
[7:18] clouds to meet the Lord in the air and
[7:21] so shall we ever be with the lord well
[7:24] I'm longing for that day aren't you
[7:26] may God added blessings you can have
[7:28] your seats
[7:30] for a title this morning I want to speak
[7:33] on listening for The Voice
[7:36] of the Resurrection
[7:39] brother Branham said and hear his voice
[7:41] so many things to dull the senses of the
[7:43] people today
[7:44] but in the midst of all of that in spite
[7:47] of every dueling dulling in every voice
[7:50] that's in the world today some of them
[7:52] pleasure voices some of them sinful
[7:54] voices to lure the people but in spite
[7:57] of every bit of that the truth of God
[8:00] Still Remains he that will hear my voice
[8:03] and come after me men and women who will
[8:06] hear the voice of God God still wants to
[8:10] speak to every individual that will open
[8:13] their ears to hear the voice
[8:15] don't you never get too busy but what
[8:19] you can stay in the presence and listen
[8:21] for his voice God always keeps his word
[8:24] no matter how bad times may be
[8:28] it don't matter how bad this world is
[8:31] getting
[8:33] it's like I said the prayer all hell is
[8:35] broke loose upon this Earth
[8:37] all the stress and strains of what's
[8:40] going on today the pressures of the
[8:43] world the voices that we're hearing out
[8:45] here
[8:46] political voices I mean our leaders we
[8:50] don't need to be listed his voice he
[8:51] don't even know what he's saying half
[8:53] the time
[8:55] it's the truth you said look at him
[8:57] you're like what's he trying to say
[8:59] I was going to add there's some
[9:01] ministers so-called ministers they're
[9:03] preaching the poor pitch you're sitting
[9:05] here wondering
[9:06] what are they saying
[9:08] we'll move on from that anyway but all
[9:11] kinds of voices that we're listening to
[9:13] when all the chaos and Hell breaking
[9:16] loose they're still the voice of God is
[9:18] one to speak to us
[9:20] oh voices of men is saying this message
[9:22] is not right
[9:24] look the voice of the devil
[9:27] uh voices saying you do too tired to go
[9:30] to church
[9:33] I've heard that voice a few times
[9:36] but there's only one voice when he'd be
[9:37] listening to this morning and that's the
[9:40] voice of Jesus Christ
[9:41] are you listening
[9:43] oh you could tell what voice you listen
[9:45] to by the way you act
[9:49] Hallelujah brother because he said Jesus
[9:52] Christ is still willing to speak that
[9:55] still Small Voice to anybody that will
[9:57] listen for him
[9:58] he is still ready to do it if we'll just
[10:02] quieten ourselves
[10:04] listen to his still Small Voice every
[10:08] one of you people who profess to be
[10:09] Christians
[10:11] set yourselves quiet before him don't
[10:14] let the Washington hinder sisters
[10:17] don't let the work hinder Brothers don't
[10:20] let nothing hinder
[10:22] don't let nobody know what you're doing
[10:26] just go before him and get the woods
[10:29] somewhere get out on the side of the
[10:31] road go into your secret closet and
[10:33] close the door when the kids are at
[10:36] school then get down on your knees
[10:39] you've heard all kinds of voices
[10:40] everywhere but just get down and stay
[10:43] there until those voices are silenced
[10:46] and you begin to lift up it'll change
[10:49] you it'll make you different
[10:53] it'll make you what you should be it'll
[10:56] make you the kind of Christian you ought
[10:59] to be
[11:00] Hallelujah but we find we're too busy
[11:04] we're always on the go
[11:06] running to and fro I say my next door
[11:10] neighbors are probably wanting the world
[11:11] because we're constantly in and out of
[11:13] our garage leaving all day long
[11:15] constantly on the go busy people that's
[11:19] the that's the age we live in we'll come
[11:21] to church we're so wore out from the
[11:23] cares of life
[11:25] from the stress and strains of the world
[11:27] what we need to do is come in that back
[11:30] door this place should be a place of
[11:32] Refuge
[11:35] we leave all the cares out there behind
[11:37] that door
[11:38] don't worry
[11:39] they'll be there when you get there when
[11:41] you walk back out you pick them up take
[11:43] them back home with you but for a moment
[11:45] for an hour or two
[11:48] times a week that's all
[11:50] leave your cares out there
[11:53] let's get it here where we're not so so
[11:55] weighted down
[11:57] with the cares of this world we can hear
[12:00] God speaking
[12:02] Hallelujah but it depends on what voice
[12:05] you're listening to
[12:07] depends on your final destination
[12:10] here in the scripture we just read that
[12:12] all it's in the grave will hear the
[12:14] voice of God
[12:16] whether you're lost or saved you're
[12:18] going to hear that voice one day
[12:21] some to life
[12:23] most to judgment
[12:25] wow goodness what is the voice of the
[12:28] Resurrection
[12:29] or who is this voice of the Resurrection
[12:32] you know who speaks to you this morning
[12:35] it's not me I'm sorry
[12:39] Adam heard the voice of God
[12:41] in the garden he talked to God the way
[12:43] it was intended to
[12:46] he was in constant fellowship with him
[12:48] God would come down in the cool of
[12:50] evening
[12:51] God would come down and have church with
[12:53] Adam
[12:54] God's come down this morning to have
[12:56] church with us
[13:00] he's standing right here all he wants to
[13:03] do for you to just open up your ears
[13:06] take a spiritual Q-tip
[13:09] clean out your ears this morning or you
[13:12] can hear God speaking to you he wants to
[13:15] hear you
[13:16] all right what happened Adam and Eve
[13:18] started listening to the voice of the
[13:20] devil
[13:22] God left them
[13:24] don't be listening No Lie of the devil
[13:26] we're not like Eve
[13:29] this second Eve ain't gonna listen No
[13:31] Lie of the devil
[13:32] we don't even need to be talking to him
[13:35] we don't need to be listened to what he
[13:37] has to say because it's nothing but lies
[13:41] Hallelujah there's only one voice
[13:45] are you listening for him
[13:48] he's not hearing all kinds of noise
[13:51] he's not here on a preacher it preaches
[13:53] loud
[13:55] even though he'll use it
[13:57] he'll use even the smallest people the
[13:59] quietest people
[14:01] when a man of God Gets behind this
[14:03] Pulpit a true called man of God it's God
[14:07] speaking to you
[14:10] Hallelujah if a man hears a voice of
[14:13] something and he's proven to be the
[14:15] voice of God and on time
[14:18] and that proceeds forth from the man
[14:20] heavens and earth will pass away but
[14:23] this word will can't pass away
[14:27] when God spoke it
[14:29] it's going to come to pass
[14:32] Elijah had a great Victory on Mount
[14:34] Carmel
[14:36] when under the anointing
[14:38] he had a prophets of a bale killed
[14:42] ran and hidden a cave
[14:44] when anointing left him
[14:46] God come to want to speak to him
[14:49] God said stand up like a man
[14:53] I'm going to say something to you
[14:55] earthquake come by we ain't come by and
[14:58] blow the rocks out
[15:01] think I'm fire
[15:03] God wouldn't need none of it
[15:05] God just come to him in a still small
[15:08] voice
[15:09] and spoke
[15:12] breath said big noises
[15:14] idiot attract a prophet
[15:16] Prophet didn't care about the big noises
[15:18] and when he heard that still Small Voice
[15:20] he knew that was the word
[15:25] we hear that still small voice today we
[15:27] know that's the word
[15:30] he says you know when I've seen this
[15:32] yesterday I was like
[15:33] wow
[15:36] the Sun
[15:37] can draw more water
[15:39] in 15 minutes without any noise at all
[15:47] we make more noise drawn out a gallon of
[15:49] water water then the sun does in a
[15:52] million barrels
[15:57] it's quiet
[16:00] it's quiet good you're quiet maybe you
[16:02] hear God Speak
[16:05] maybe you hear that still small voice
[16:08] but we're always looking for something
[16:10] that's big
[16:12] a lot of hooray
[16:14] a lot of Racket to it
[16:17] but it wasn't in the earthquake or the
[16:19] wind of the fire God spoke to him in a
[16:21] still small voice
[16:23] we've had our Thunder in the Pentecost
[16:27] we've had our thundering of God sent a
[16:29] prophet
[16:31] God speaks and Thunders God speaks
[16:33] enlightening but he also likes to speak
[16:36] in quietness
[16:38] in that still small voice
[16:41] you used to hear people say God spoke to
[16:44] me today
[16:45] and you're like you're waiting with the
[16:48] Audible Voice
[16:51] I've never heard the Ottawa voice of God
[16:54] some of these might have
[16:57] I hear him in that still Small Voice the
[16:59] quietness
[17:01] if I could get myself quiet enough
[17:04] the kind of person I am I can't get
[17:06] still long enough
[17:07] God just about has to shake you calm
[17:10] down a minute so I can speak to you
[17:14] I'm not along in that
[17:17] has longer we're listening to the things
[17:18] around us we can't hear him
[17:22] it's that still small voice
[17:25] sometimes we drown it out
[17:29] guilty
[17:33] where this is all kinds of voices
[17:36] voices of
[17:37] the man it's a Pulpit
[17:41] voices of TV evangelists
[17:45] that's who you were listening to One Day
[17:47] you're listening to denominational
[17:48] voices
[17:50] but one day you stumbled into a message
[17:52] Church
[17:53] and you heard the voice of God you like
[17:56] something is real
[17:58] this church has something real
[18:01] I've got something real you heard
[18:04] something different You Heard a Voice
[18:06] through the man it's a Pulpit and that
[18:08] voice came from eternity
[18:10] and called you out
[18:13] there's a voice drawing you
[18:16] know which voice are you listening to
[18:18] this scripture we read in John chapter 5
[18:21] verse 28 29. that's the voice of the
[18:24] Resurrection
[18:25] there's two resurrections at the end
[18:28] once for the bride and the others for
[18:30] the entire race
[18:32] but notice in this verse 28 is not to
[18:35] the bride
[18:38] it's to the world
[18:39] the Rapture has already took place but
[18:41] this takes but this happens
[18:43] we're already at the marriage supper
[18:47] toward the end of it
[18:49] we're going into the Millennium and at
[18:51] the end of the millennium
[18:53] that's when this takes place
[18:56] John 5 25 says verily verily I say unto
[18:59] you the hours coming and now is
[19:02] that the Dead
[19:05] how many were dead
[19:07] we were dead in our sins and trespasses
[19:11] when the dead shall hear the voice of
[19:13] the son of God
[19:15] have you heard his voice
[19:16] if you hadn't heard his voice if you're
[19:18] still dead in sin listen real close he's
[19:21] calling you
[19:23] he's calling the voice of the
[19:26] Resurrection he wants to resurrect your
[19:28] dead body and bring you to life this
[19:30] morning
[19:31] they that hear shall live
[19:36] Hallelujah when it happens the pride is
[19:38] already gone
[19:41] well proof
[19:42] brother Brown says in a church age book
[19:45] I should have said Church age book A lot
[19:46] of people don't like that book
[19:49] he's wrote by a man they said
[19:51] the question now arrives
[19:54] why are these righteous ones in the
[19:56] judgment
[19:57] there is no
[19:59] no come up
[20:01] for there but two resurrections since
[20:03] they could not qualify for the first
[20:05] resurrection they must come up in the
[20:07] second which is the resurrection to
[20:10] judgment
[20:11] the one who's qualified for the first
[20:14] resurrection
[20:16] the bride
[20:20] Brother JD we're pre-qualified
[20:24] you know you get these little things in
[20:26] the mail
[20:27] you've been pre-qualified for this
[20:29] credit card oh you get all excited five
[20:32] thousand dollars
[20:34] you fill it out turn it in sorry
[20:39] you didn't qualify
[20:41] but we got a pre-qualification
[20:45] this is a hundred percent qualification
[20:48] we were the back part of God's mind
[20:50] before the foundation of the world
[20:52] we were pre-qualified before the world
[20:55] ever began
[20:56] there's no devil in hell could take that
[20:59] from you
[21:01] Hallelujah
[21:03] that name can never be removed
[21:06] qualified for the rapture
[21:09] you might walk around in your flesh
[21:11] you're wondering
[21:13] if I'd I don't feel it
[21:16] I don't feel it
[21:18] but just remember you've been
[21:20] pre-qualified
[21:23] you're going to come to it the bride is
[21:25] not in the judgment
[21:27] Jesus must had yet another group in mind
[21:31] who had a certain Resurrection will
[21:32] receive eternal life they will receive
[21:35] it at the resurrection not previously
[21:38] received it as a member of the Bride
[21:41] John 5 28 29 Marvel not at this for the
[21:44] hours coming at which all is in the
[21:46] grave shall hear his voice
[21:49] John 5 28 29 is not the rapture
[21:54] for only the dead in Christ will rise
[21:57] from the graves at that time along with
[21:59] the living bride which is still on the
[22:01] earth first Thessalonians 4 16.
[22:04] and 17. I read it
[22:07] this but it says in John 5 28 29 that
[22:11] are going to come forth from the grave
[22:15] you're coming forth
[22:18] if you die Christian
[22:20] or you die lost you're coming forth
[22:26] the day is going to be brought before
[22:28] the Lord and judged
[22:30] Hallelujah whose names were not in the
[22:32] Book of Life
[22:34] and then they're going to be cast into
[22:35] the Lake of Fire do you recognize the
[22:38] voice of God
[22:40] Jesus says my sheep knows my voice
[22:44] and a stranger they won't follow
[22:46] you have heard the voice of God
[22:49] you won't be fought in any other voices
[22:54] no other voice will you follow
[22:57] Hallelujah if you hear the voice of God
[23:00] today you're a sheep
[23:06] what are you if you don't hear the voice
[23:07] of God
[23:09] you're a goat
[23:15] I don't know why I put that in there but
[23:17] that sounds pretty good
[23:19] if you're just a lamb
[23:22] but you you might be a lamb but you
[23:24] still haven't heard the shepherd's voice
[23:25] yet
[23:26] he's calling
[23:28] listen listen for him
[23:31] are you quiet enough where you can hear
[23:33] it listen for that still small voice
[23:37] and a stranger they will not follow
[23:40] but will flee from him for they know not
[23:43] the voice of strangers
[23:46] it's like your dog
[23:48] you'll go in the door and
[23:50] hey little boy he come running like
[23:53] you has
[23:58] he'll run from them
[24:01] that's why we need to do the devil he's

[24:19] sometimes we talk to the devil what do
[24:21] we do God
[24:26] only time God hears from some of us is
[24:28] when we uh pray over our food
[24:33] bless his food in Jesus name
[24:36] or if we go to bed
[24:38] oh I hadn't prayed today you lay your
[24:40] head on the pillar

[25:07] speak to God the more he's going to
[25:09] speak to us
[25:10] lay aside the cares of the world listen
[25:13] for the voice of God
[25:15] but there's a voice calling us to
[25:17] judgment
[25:19] I don't want to be called to judgment
[25:20] because there's a voice calling people
[25:22] to judgment
[25:25] it don't matter how old you are

[27:39] Hallelujah
[27:41] brother Graham said voice of many Waters
[27:45] what do these Waters represent
[27:48] the water represents multitudes and
[27:50] people and tongues
[27:52] voice what a horrible thing
[27:58] of life
[28:00] no pilate to guide him
[28:03] loose floating with the tides to hear
[28:05] the Roar of a great cataracts
[28:08] I could hear him when he's preaching
[28:10] this
[28:12] wished I could do it like he did
[28:15] to hear the Roar of the Greek cataracts
[28:17] the falls
[28:18] what a horrible thing it would be to a
[28:21] soul drifting
[28:23] voice of many Waters what is this voice
[28:26] it's the Judgment it's the voice of the
[28:30] ministers through the Holy Spirit cried
[28:34] out to the people
[28:36] in every age standing there
[28:38] the voice of many Waters crying out
[28:42] he says what it'll be know that you set
[28:44] in these meetings and heard that you
[28:46] should get right with God and receive
[28:49] the Holy Ghost and a drifting soul to
[28:51] hear the voice speak out in that meeting
[28:54] that you set in and heard the judgments
[28:57] of God preached and refused it
[29:00] the great fall
[29:02] is ahead of you the great cataracts to
[29:06] take you to your Eternal Doom
[29:09] wow

[29:15] that's not my destination
[29:18] my destination is heaven
[29:22] we're in this world but we're not part
[29:24] of it
[29:26] we're going home soon
[29:30] very soon
[29:33] voice of the Resurrection
[29:36] or the voice of damnation which one will
[29:39] you hear
[29:41] when it takes place
[29:43] Jesus came down took on flesh
[29:47] died for our sins
[29:49] took the whip upon his back for us
[29:52] sacrifice for you

[31:14] God calling
[31:17] some has heard the voices of
[31:18] resurrections other will hear the voice
[31:20] of damnation
[31:22] and then we cast it to the Lake of Fire
[31:24] and brother you don't want to be there
[31:28] one of these days is going to give you
[31:31] your final call
[31:33] and then the door is going to be closed

[31:55] on the curtain of time
[31:56] where you've seen young people and he
[31:59] says when I knew I had to return back
[32:03] there was only one thing that I would
[32:05] return to
[32:08] there's a way he said one thing I would
[32:10] return back to you for is to tell you
[32:12] people

[32:49] I am that I am go down to Egypt

[32:58] he was predestinated he heard the voice
[33:01] of God God changed him around changed

[33:14] Miss Catholic
[33:16] whatever denomination you come out of we
[33:18] were called Miss message
[33:24] oh Hallelujah
[33:26] we were called all kinds of names
[33:29] but we heard the voice of God we had a
[33:31] name change
[33:33] we're now Mrs Jesus Christ
[33:36] Hallelujah Paul's life was changed just
[33:39] like yours were
[33:41] you didn't have a care in the world
[33:43] you were out surfing brother Travis
[33:48] one day God got a hold of you
[33:50] you heard that voice you might have been
[33:52] in a bar room somewhere
[33:55] I've heard sometimes when people get
[33:57] drunk
[33:58] they start talking about Jesus
[34:01] maybe one day you were drunk
[34:07] by talking to him
[34:11] what a life I live Lord and he started
[34:13] speaking back to you and changed your
[34:15] life forever
[34:18] you were once drunk on the things of the
[34:20] world
[34:21] you're still drunk this morning
[34:25] yeah you're
[34:28] can
[34:30] drinking from the Fountain of Life
[34:32] Hallelujah
[34:35] somewhere down the inside was a
[34:37] predestinated sea given to you from the
[34:39] foundation of the world
[34:41] foreign
[34:42] and it came to life
[34:45] you weren't expecting it
[34:48] you never respect it you weren't looking
[34:51] for God
[34:53] a lot of people say I was looking for
[34:54] God no you weren't
[34:56] you were happy in your sins
[35:01] is that brother Diggs
[35:10] we were happy in our sins
[35:16] but one day Hallelujah God Yanks you up
[35:20] called you
[35:23] Hallelujah I'm hurrying Lazarus heard
[35:27] the voice of the Resurrection
[35:31] he was a real dead man
[35:34] Lazarus house was a place according to
[35:37] the prophet that Jesus would stop and
[35:39] rest from his preaching
[35:42] Lazarus was a good friend of Jesus
[35:46] I am too Lord
[35:50] we're told Lazarus was a scribe
[35:53] when Jesus was baptized Lazarus started
[35:55] falling
[35:56] he was a bosom friend to Lazarus
[36:00] so his house was a place that Jesus
[36:01] liked to go and rest from all his
[36:03] healing campaigns and preaching
[36:05] Jesus felt comfortable there in his
[36:07] house
[36:13] does he feel comfortable in your home
[36:17] foreign
[36:19] but Jesus had to leave
[36:22] he knew there was supposed to be a
[36:23] miracle take place
[36:25] he knew Lazarus was going to get sick
[36:27] and he knew if he was there he would
[36:28] have to heal him
[36:30] but he wanted a greater testimony so
[36:34] Jesus left
[36:36] and when Jesus leaves your home you know
[36:38] Barbara said about it
[36:40] the devil
[36:41] likes to come in
[36:45] well forget about Jesus sometimes we'll
[36:47] just put him over on a corner
[36:49] forget who he is how many here
[36:53] would invite me over to your house
[36:57] and put me over in a chair and don't
[36:59] even talk to me
[37:02] brother Aaron that's one
[37:08] so why do we do Jesus that way
[37:12] we want Jesus be the god of our home
[37:16] but we don't even talk to him
[37:20] say your preaching real slow today I'm
[37:22] trying to be like Brother JD
[37:25] he says great things when he's ghosts
[37:27] when he goes slow
[37:31] we don't even read our Bibles every day
[37:33] like we should
[37:36] I got a mirror it's okay I'm right here
[37:38] looking at myself and I'm praying
[37:40] and preaching I mean
[37:44] we wonder why we don't have no more move
[37:46] of God in our life
[37:50] if I say anything wrong bro Jason will
[37:51] be here Wednesday straight me out
[37:54] but when Jesus leaves your home expect
[37:56] trouble to hit
[38:00] what kind of homes we have if Jesus had
[38:02] preeminence
[38:04] if you let Jesus be the god of it if you
[38:07] put him first what kind of homes will we
[38:09] have
[38:12] is Jesus comfortable enough in your
[38:14] heart where you can say go to the
[38:15] refrigerator God
[38:18] my favorite Cherry Pepsi drinks in there
[38:19] go ahead and get it
[38:23] here here Lord sit right here in my
[38:26] favorite chair
[38:33] Hallelujah
[38:36] man
[38:38] but this case they did nothing wrong
[38:42] Lazarus and his sisters but God want to
[38:44] be glorified
[38:48] Jesus tarried
[38:50] Lazarus got sick Jesus tarried they sent
[38:52] free word to Jesus no answer
[38:55] day two
[38:57] Jesus your friend Lazarus is sick he's
[39:01] trying to work on Jesus's emotion
[39:05] didn't come
[39:06] finally Lazarus died
[39:09] how many here
[39:10] if you called up brother Jason to come
[39:12] pray for you in a hospital he didn't
[39:13] come that probably hurt your feelings
[39:17] yeah I'm gonna find somewhere else to go
[39:21] he don't care no more for me than that
[39:24] can you imagine what Martha and Mary
[39:26] were thinking
[39:28] they didn't know
[39:31] that in a little bit they was going to
[39:33] hear that voice of the Resurrection
[39:36] Hallelujah we don't know but in a little
[39:39] bit we're going to hear the voice of the
[39:42] Resurrection
[39:44] they were in a time of delay
[39:47] Jesus was delaying
[39:49] they were in the time of delay
[39:52] no answer
[39:54] if you're sick this morning you've been
[39:56] praying for a long time and you're in
[39:58] that time of delay
[40:00] don't worry
[40:01] God knows
[40:06] the voice of the Resurrection is coming
[40:10] it's been a miracle Jesus has stayed
[40:11] healed Lazarus
[40:13] it would have been
[40:14] it had been a greater Miracle when he
[40:16] can call him forth from the tomb
[40:19] Jesus comes on his own time
[40:21] he knows the best for us when you see
[40:24] you're at your ropes in
[40:28] hold on God knows what he's doing
[40:31] are you going to be like Joe
[40:37] though God slay me yet I'll trust him
[40:41] do you trust him through all things
[40:44] through everything Mary and Martha had
[40:47] reached their end
[40:49] their dad mom was gone now their brother
[40:52] was gone what were they going to do
[40:55] they left their Church to follow Jesus
[41:01] and Jesus wouldn't know where to be
[41:02] found
[41:03] they left for him but he wouldn't come
[41:05] for them
[41:08] Battle of the mind they were thinking
[41:10] I thought he loved us
[41:14] but I tell you as long as you have Jesus
[41:17] you're never alone
[41:22] you young people
[41:25] you don't have friends out here
[41:29] you say I don't have no friends
[41:32] but you got the best friend that man
[41:34] could ever have
[41:35] in the Lord Jesus Christ
[41:40] John 11 17 Jesus came
[41:43] and he found he laid in the graves four
[41:45] days already
[41:47] Bethany was nine to Jerusalem about 15
[41:49] furlongs about two miles
[41:51] and many of the Jews came to Martha and
[41:53] Mary to comfort them concerning their
[41:54] brother
[41:57] then Martha as soon as she heard that
[41:59] Jesus was coming went and met him
[42:01] but Mary sit still in the house
[42:04] then said Martha unto Jesus Lord if thou
[42:08] Hast been here my brother had not died
[42:11] she had faith
[42:15] but I know that even now
[42:18] whatsoever thou will ask of God God will
[42:23] give it to thee
[42:28] pause
[42:33] Jesus saith unto her
[42:35] thy brother shall rise again
[42:39] Martha said unto him I know
[42:43] he'll rise again in the resurrection of
[42:44] the last day
[42:47] she wasn't looking for it Jesus said
[42:49] unto her
[42:51] but oh I am the resurrection
[43:02] dead yet shall he live
[43:05] Hallelujah
[43:08] the same I am that came to Moses in the
[43:12] burning bush
[43:13] that same one and spoke let there be
[43:16] light
[43:17] it's the same one that said I am the
[43:19] resurrection and the life
[43:21] and whosoever liveth and Believes In Me
[43:25] shall never die
[43:31] love this question
[43:41] Beretta said thy brother shall rise
[43:42] again she said yes Lord I know
[43:45] the Jews believed in a general
[43:46] Resurrection
[43:48] said I know Lord he'll raise the last
[43:50] days as a general Resurrection he was a
[43:51] good boy
[43:52] I know he'll raise up
[43:55] watch him he says there's no beauty that
[43:58] we should desire him
[43:59] let alone skinny guy Jesus was
[44:02] he wasn't a great big Priestly looking
[44:04] fella he was a skinny fella
[44:07] and he straightened his little frame up
[44:09] and said
[44:11] can you imagine you see Jesus
[44:15] straight his little Frame Up
[44:18] I have the resurrection and the life
[44:23] what
[44:27] Hallelujah he that believeth on me
[44:32] though he did yes I live
[44:36] and Jesus therefore saw her weeping and
[44:38] the Jews also weeping which came into
[44:40] hurt he grown and his Spirit was
[44:41] troubled
[44:43] this is where have you lady
[44:46] they said unto the Lord come and see
[44:48] and then Jesus wept
[44:54] he's a man
[44:56] he wept
[45:00] he was a man when he's in a boat asleep
[45:04] but when a storm rose up he was God when
[45:07] he said peace be still
[45:11] he was a man when he walks up to the
[45:13] tomb of Lazarus
[45:16] he wept like a man
[45:19] he cried
[45:22] Jesus says take you away the stone
[45:24] Martha
[45:27] and the sister of him that was dead
[45:30] unto him Lord
[45:33] but by this time
[45:35] my sin stinks
[45:44] for he had been dead four days
[45:47] I found this interesting
[45:51] I've tried to find it brother JD I can't
[45:53] I don't know where I got it
[45:55] this is four days the rabbis taught that
[45:58] the spirit wandered about for three days
[46:00] seeking readmission
[46:03] into the body
[46:05] but abandoned it on the fourth day
[46:09] my opinion
[46:11] take it as it is my opinion
[46:13] I believe that's why Jesus waited
[46:16] there'd be no doubt this man's dead
[46:20] that his Lazarus Spirit was already gone
[46:22] towards his destination
[46:26] Lazarus had been dead four days
[46:29] skin worms has started to destroy his
[46:30] flesh
[46:32] and his nose caved in
[46:34] but it was time for a body change
[46:40] it's time for a body change
[46:44] I need one
[46:47] the voice of the Resurrection was going
[46:49] to speak and Lazarus body was going to
[46:52] change
[46:53] it's just like Abraham and Sarah
[46:56] they were old
[46:59] too old to have any children
[47:03] they had a body change
[47:04] when God said it's time
[47:09] the king of the Philistines
[47:12] looked at Sarah
[47:21] he was a young man
[47:23] why would he want a 90 year old grandma
[47:28] unless she was changed
[47:31] foreign
[47:33] why would God want to own the crepey
[47:36] little bride
[47:39] walking around here feeble
[47:41] walking around with swollen ankle
[47:43] gray hair no hair
[47:49] but we've got to be changed
[47:52] that voice is going to speak to us and
[47:55] we're going to be changed
[47:57] Hallelujah
[48:00] the real you bursting forth out of these
[48:02] bodies
[48:03] from the dust and will be like job
[48:06] though the skin worms destroy this body
[48:08] yet in my flesh shall I see God
[48:13] Jesus says roll away the stone
[48:19] he told these two sisters roll away the
[48:22] stone
[48:23] you see these two little frail women
[48:24] over here trying to roll away this big
[48:26] old stone
[48:28] but they had something to do
[48:31] if they want to receive something
[48:36] Hallelujah if you're needing to overcome
[48:39] a sin that seems to be hanging on
[48:45] it's time to roll Wick back that stone
[48:51] you've got to do it
[48:53] God ain't going to come down and roll it
[48:55] back for you
[48:57] if you want to hear a voice of the
[48:59] Resurrection roll back the stone
[49:02] roll back the stone of unbelief
[49:05] roll back the stone of the things of
[49:07] this world
[49:09] you need Deliverance roll back your
[49:11] stone of rock and roll
[49:13] back the stone of watching things you
[49:16] shouldn't
[49:17] roll the stone away
[49:21] the stone that's in your way is a fear
[49:24] of Who You Are
[49:28] afraid of it
[49:29] of it you've got to roll it away
[49:32] you gotta put your back into it

[49:40] Resurrection get rid of the Stone
[49:45] what do you have need of
[49:47] is it healing roll that sickness Stone
[49:50] away from you
[49:53] Hallelujah Martha Mary they came to the
[49:55] stone
[49:57] it stunk so bad behind it
[50:01] you can imagine smelling rotten flesh
[50:06] can you smell can you imagine the smell
[50:08] that goes up to God's nostrils of us
[50:12] of our stinking flesh
[50:17] they struggled they got it done
[50:20] you may struggle with this Stone you
[50:21] might not get the mood the first time
[50:24] it might not even budge
[50:26] but keep at it
[50:28] maybe God wants to see your sincerity
[50:32] It's Time It's Time Lord I want this
[50:34] Stone out of my way
[50:36] I've got to have the strength to do it
[50:38] you've got to make an effort
[50:41] it doesn't matter how bad your sin
[50:44] smells
[50:47] you've got to want to be delivered from
[50:50] it
[50:56] I want the people that they thought
[50:59] Jesus standing there tell these two
[51:00] women to roll back that Big Stone
[51:07] in the absolute
[51:08] great message
[51:11] he went down to the Grave there stood a
[51:13] man
[51:14] there stood God in flesh
[51:17] that could have said to that stone
[51:18] dissolve
[51:20] and it were dissolved
[51:22] but he said to them Little Women them
[51:25] Poor Little Women they're little young
[51:27] women take away the stone you've got
[51:30] something to do and they wrote away the
[51:33] stone and it made them sick
[51:37] it was so stinky
[51:42] Jesus stood there so stoop shouldered
[51:45] perhaps turning gray
[51:48] when he was not yet 30 years old and the
[51:51] Bible says he might have looked like 40
[51:53] or 50.
[51:54] you're a man not over 50 years old
[51:58] and you say you've been and you say
[51:59] you've seen Abraham
[52:02] before Abraham I was I am
[52:05] and we come to find out here he stood by
[52:07] the grave and he know that a vision had
[52:09] to strike he knew it had to be take away
[52:11] the stone
[52:12] he was stinking wrapped in Gray clothes
[52:14] and been dead for four days his nose had
[52:16] already caved in
[52:19] there he stood there
[52:21] straightened his little body
[52:24] I have the resurrection in the life
[52:27] and he that believeth on me though he
[52:29] were dead yes shall he live
[52:31] tell me a man that could ever make a
[52:33] statement like that
[52:35] whosoever liveth and believeth in me
[52:38] shall never die believeth to all this
[52:42] where have you laid him he says
[52:45] down he went to the Grave
[52:47] weeping like a man and when he got down
[52:50] there
[52:51] what did he say
[52:54] now do you when you get there you got
[52:57] something to do too you know take you
[52:59] away the stone
[53:00] if you want to see a miracle
[53:03] you sick people tonight if you want to
[53:05] see a miracle take away the stone
[53:08] take away that stone that sin that lays
[53:10] before the door
[53:12] you say Brother Bear I don't do nothing
[53:15] but if you don't believe it it can't
[53:17] happen
[53:18] take away the stone of unbelief and
[53:20] watch what happens just take away a
[53:22] stone and we shall obey the word of the
[53:24] Lord she saw a miracle
[53:26] [Music]
[53:27] there was another Stone wrote away one
[53:29] day
[53:31] another Resurrection
[53:33] it was Jesus Christ
[53:35] it was his turn to be raised from the
[53:37] dead the voice of the Resurrection
[53:39] rising up from his grave
[53:43] two women was going to that grave
[53:48] two women was going to that grave but
[53:50] this time they're going to bring spices
[53:53] I guess they thought they were going to
[53:54] roll the stone back and go in and anoint
[53:57] the body of Jesus
[53:59] but when they got there there was no
[54:01] stone to be moved
[54:02] the voice of the Resurrection spoke that
[54:05] stone moved
[54:07] the voice of the Resurrection is going
[54:09] to speak and each one of us is going to
[54:11] move
[54:12] when God speaks things happen
[54:17] when he said let there be light it
[54:20] happened
[54:21] when he says you're going to be healed
[54:23] it's going to happen
[54:25] when God speaks Miracles take place
[54:30] we've seen it happen
[54:33] preachers pray for you when you're sick
[54:36] and you turn and you walk out of here
[54:37] you're healed
[54:41] Hallelujah
[54:46] another quote
[54:49] this is probably the best one
[54:55] action in the life
[54:57] and he that believeth in me though he
[54:59] were yes shall he live
[55:02] he says speak
[55:04] omnipotence
[55:06] miraculous will take place
[55:09] and he always does it at the junction
[55:12] and we're at the junction
[55:14] blr when you see these things happening
[55:16] we're at the end time all beneficent
[55:19] speaks
[55:21] and a dead man
[55:25] lived again stood on his feet and went
[55:28] to a banquet he supper with him
[55:30] what happened
[55:34] oh my
[55:36] what happened
[55:38] some glorious day all we who are once
[55:41] dead in sin and trespasses omnipotence
[55:46] we were going to hell omnipotent spoke
[55:52] Hallelujah
[55:55] we've raised from hell
[55:58] to glory and someday we'll be a banquet
[56:01] supper
[56:05] at the last days
[56:06] speaks God's word is omnipotent we
[56:10] believe it and raised from Death unto
[56:12] life
[56:14] he that heareth my words and Believes In
[56:16] Me though he were dead yet shall he live
[56:19] omnipotence
[56:22] we're like Noah he says building away on
[56:25] the ark the miraculous will take place
[56:28] someday when the Rapture comes and Jesus
[56:30] comes we're at The Junction now when you
[56:32] see these things happen raise up your
[56:35] head your Redemption is drawing now
[56:38] omnipotence speaks and miraculous is
[56:41] done
[56:44] but you got to know the person of The
[56:46] Voice
[56:47] God I have the personal voice living
[56:50] down on the inside
[56:52] in order to hear the voice of the
[56:54] Resurrection
[56:57] with that same voice he'll call out the
[56:59] Saints
[57:03] Matthew 27 50 Jesus said when he cried
[57:05] out with a loud voice yelled it up the
[57:07] ghost
[57:08] he said it is finished
[57:12] he didn't say he was dead
[57:14] he just said it is finished
[57:17] the work that I came to do is finished
[57:23] and behold the veil of the temple was
[57:25] red and Twain From the top to the bottom
[57:27] and the Earth did quake and the Rocks
[57:30] rent and the graves were opened and many
[57:32] bodies which slept a rose
[57:35] and came out of the Graze
[57:38] of the resurrection and went into the
[57:40] holy city and appeared unto many the
[57:44] second Exodus
[57:45] foreign
[57:46] our pastor preaching on it
[57:49] that's the second Exodus The Godly men
[57:52] of the Old Testament Jacob says when I
[57:55] died take me over there and bury me in
[57:57] the land
[57:58] Joseph when he died says
[58:01] when you leave here and you're going to
[58:03] take me bury with my fathers they knew
[58:06] when the resurrection was going to take
[58:08] place
[58:09] they knew where the voice was going to
[58:11] come to where the voice was going to
[58:13] speak
[58:14] oh brother sister today we don't have to
[58:17] go to Israel
[58:19] we don't have to go to Israel to hear
[58:21] the voice of the Resurrection the voice
[58:23] of the Resurrection is going to come to
[58:25] us
[58:27] it's coming to us
[58:29] we're going to be in the right place
[58:32] as well the right place at the right
[58:35] time

[58:45] let me get this first
[58:47] Lazarus
[58:49] we didn't email the gray did we
[58:52] he's still dead
[58:57] God when he was Jesus when the man
[58:59] walked up
[59:01] and wept
[59:05] stood straight up when he spoke his name
[59:13] hey Lazarus come forth
[59:17] to call for Lazarus
[59:20] you had to have a big voice
[59:23] because Lazarus was on a four-day
[59:24] Journey
[59:28] that voice of the Resurrection had a
[59:30] stream for him
[59:32] Lazarus
[59:33] cut forth
[59:37] it didn't take four days for that Spirit
[59:39] to get back into Lazarus immediately
[59:42] here he come out of the Tomb unwrap him
[59:45] no we're going to hear that voice
[59:49] Bride come forth

[1:00:13] somebody made a comment said 60 is super
[1:00:15] old
[1:00:21] I'm only 51 so I'm pretty old
[1:00:25] foreign
[1:00:29] if I die
[1:00:32] before you young Brothers
[1:00:34] and the Rapture takes place
[1:00:37] I'm coming up first
[1:00:41] so don't be
[1:00:45] a sure

[1:00:54] died and rose again even so then which
[1:00:56] also sleep in Jesus God's going to bring
[1:00:58] with him
[1:01:00] the voice of the Resurrection is going
[1:01:02] to call us first
[1:01:03] he's gonna
[1:01:05] I'm putting myself in the grave already
[1:01:06] he's going to call the dead ones first
[1:01:10] and he want to come and get the rest of
[1:01:12] us
[1:01:14] Hallelujah for this we say unto you by
[1:01:17] the word of the Lord that we which are
[1:01:19] alive and remain unto the coming the
[1:01:22] Lord shall not prevent them which are
[1:01:24] asleep
[1:01:25] for the Lord himself out of Sin from
[1:01:28] heaven with the shout
[1:01:31] the message
[1:01:33] with the voice of the archangel
[1:01:37] and with the Trump of God and the dead
[1:01:40] in Christ shall rise first
[1:01:44] then we which are alive and remain shall
[1:01:48] be caught up together with them in the
[1:01:51] clouds to meet the Lord in the air so
[1:01:54] shall we ever be with the Lord
[1:01:59] called up
[1:02:01] we're going to be pulled up we're going
[1:02:04] to be seized God's going to take us by
[1:02:07] force the big gravity arm of God is just

[1:17:23] Jesus Christ with all your heart

[1:17:27] be baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:17:29] Jesus Christ and you shall receive that

[1:17:45] before the Lord there's the Lord is
[1:17:48] doing great things in this hour as he's
[1:17:50] saying he's speaking speaking present
[1:17:53] tense

[1:18:08] preaching of the word it's changing us
[1:18:10] from glory to glory we're beholding him
[1:18:14] so it's it's not there's a lot of voices
[1:18:16] there's a lot of voices in this age and
