Lord father we just place this service into your hands For Your Glory in Jesus name amen if you have your Bibles will turn to Ezekiel chapter 37 and we'll read verse 1 down to three and then we'll read the rest later I guess you couldn't tell by the special songs what I'm going to be preaching on tonight they did an outstanding job a lot better what I would have done for sure Ezekiel 37 1. the hand of the Lord was upon me and carried me out of the spirit of the Lord and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of Bones and caused me to pass by them round about and behold there were very many in the open Valley and although they were very dry and he said unto me son of man can these bones live and I answered O Lord God thou knowest may the Lord has blessings you have your seats for a title tonight I want to speak on bringing dry bones to life bringing dry bones to life first thing I just wanted to go ahead and say I was going to speak for my wife and we appreciate the prayers y'all prayed for her this week and she's here so there take that devil you know every time the it's time for me to preach the devil he likes to attack if he's not attacking me he's attacking my wife he's attacking her he's taking them attacking my dogs and it's all kinds it's something all the time I just mentioned the brother Matt on Monday he wanted me to do a job for him this morning and I told him okay I work out good I'll just spend all day Tuesday studying that then the devil attacked us it attacked my wife and then Hospital on that Monday night and yesterday just just tired in body but we're here to preach she asked me seriously he said are you still going to preach tomorrow night I said I guess so I ain't let no devil stop me we're here to defeat every devil so we're just here tonight we're just going to throat punch the devil how many wants to throw punch him with me lord I can't wait till the day that we get to heaven I hope the Lord gives us each 100 years just to kick the devil around but if you don't we can do it right now we go ahead right now start kicking the devil we have every right to stomp on that devil we were made to defeat him but I go that way because I'll start preaching on something else but we're made to defeat the Devil it don't matter what he throws against you trouble back Bible matter we're here we can stalk that devil we can beat him on everything he throws at us we are given a god-given right to stand up against him we ain't afraid of him Hallelujah ain't no devil gonna stand in front of you we're the Bride of Jesus Christ we have rights Hallelujah but if you if you're too weak tonight to defeat the Devil we're here to give you quickening power we're here to speak your dry bones to life that's the title Lord give us strength we all need strength there's times we even the preachers we need it we feel like sometimes we get dry we'll sit and just same old day after day and you y'all know what we're talking about y'all been out the world y'all come in here y'all just want to sit down and just relax I've heard Bud Donnie say that's the best sleep as people get is right here in church but if you're gonna if I see you sleeping I'm gonna call your name Hallelujah make these bones live again it's like bring you know that that song bring back the new again I want to see you again you remember how it was you first got saved I'll use up on cloud nine nothing's going wrong oh you're praying all the time you're reading your Bible you listen the tapes tape after tape after tape what happened to us what happened to us we were drinking the milk God was allowing us to feel his presence every time we come to church we were babies but then God pulled his Spirit back off of us see how you're going to react some of us went the wrong way some of us went too far some of us got dried up in our bones [Music] Hallelujah don't be scared say man you know the scripture signifies the Eve when Israel was scattered we won't go into all that detail we all know the story how they were scattered out all over the Earth but things happened World War One World War II things happened started driving Israel back to their Homeland started bringing bone upon bone back to them so that's what that's all about but we're living in a Time an age of death the world out here is dead dead everywhere and where you look there's death even in the churches I ain't just talk about denominational churches they got death verse death brought in their own message ranks Hallelujah people sitting in churches that are dying there's no life Hallelujah cause out of my belly shall flow rivers of Living Water you know what happens when a baby is born the baby comes out there's no breath doctor will pick it up smack its bottom it screams takes a big deep breath Brother JD I think is what we need to do some church people we need to pick them up and give them a good spanking by the gospel bring them back to life bring them dead bones back to life okay I quote Brevard says tell me the organization when it raises up they started with a move starts to organize they organize it later it died right there they become stillborn children that's dead children what they need is some gospel spanking exactly to bring it back to life so if you're dead come on up here let's give you a spanking we're going to bring these bones back to life we see these churches they're not producing children they're producing images of their pasture Hallelujah they act like your pastor well sometimes that's a good thing sometimes it's not some pastors are deader than four o'clock so what do they produce a church that said at four o'clock oh I'm so happy we got a live pastor we got a pastor we don't have to worry about he's not here to produce a bunch of Watkins he's already done that there's a few of you sitting here we're not to be the image of our pastor yeah he's ordained to see us through we're supposed to stay with him but he's not he's not here to produce a bunch of Watkins he's here to produce a bunch of Jesus Christ Hallelujah I know I'm sure he's sitting there chomping at the bit ain't been up here for about six weeks Lord will he'll be back up here on Sunday I'm sure he's chomping he's wanting to get up here he's not a dead Pastor there's firing him Bones those fire Them Bones want to start preaching brother Matt you know what it's talking about when you get a message from the Lord It's like a burning bunt in your bones that's what Jeremiah said Hallelujah it's all right we're not to be Children of the pastor we're the children of God born in His image Hallelujah we had those churches that have no life at all they walk around like a bunch of zombies you know what a zombie is they make these movies as zombies they just walk around got that stare in her eyes they'll look left or right they don't know where they come from they don't know where they're going a bunch of zombies Walking Dead dead men walking I'm going to say it I see some people sitting in church with that stare no life in them [Laughter] Hallelujah it'll be all right I'll probably be up here for a while oh we even got some professional sleepers in this message I've seen them they got their eyes wide open sleep and even nodding her head and saying amen see them do it the witness Dead Men Walking no life brother and sister if you had a life you you could wait till service to start tonight you can't wait for them doors to be unlocked by Brother Charles we should be so happy to get in here that's the way with the way we were one day we were walking dead men we were born in sin shaped in an equity we come into the world speaking lies that's how we were that's exactly walking aimlessly we had that stare in our eyes going from church to church going from Baptist to Presbyterian a methless Catholic that only makes sense you start Catholic go the other way but go to Pentecostal even message people walking around aimlessly dead no life a bunch of dry bones it makes you when you can see them can you want to say God can these balls live Hallelujah a bunch of dry bones but God's looking for a church that's on fire with the baptism of the Holy Ghost where we can have Revival every service I don't get too far ahead of myself but every time we come to those doors we should be in a Revival the church world's revivals is over we heard that years ago but we're still in a bride's Revival Hallelujah I'll stop right there for now we're living in time that the Church of God needs to come to life this ain't the time to be a dead Church this ain't the time just to be sitting around not doing nothing you know people always like doing this talk about going to ball games people goes and watch their kids play play sports or the grandkids and their teeth their boy will do something good brother Gideon when you make a big three-point shot or whatever you do does does bro Matt just sit there like this or even situational he scored a point no you're up and jumping around screaming come on now you're up jumping and screaming you'll lose your voice when's the last time you lost your voice in church Hallelujah people act like they do when their favorite team scores a touchdown oh they go around High fiving everybody they're so excited when's the last time you high-fived a brother over something was said from the pulpit I guilty I've done it one time we were having special amazing brother Tim Pruitt was preaching I still remember the sermon it's the mighty angel oh the parent one of the most powerful service I've ever been in we were actually young people we're standing in the back because we gave all the older people the seats and he was preaching I mean you know how blood Tim gets when that when he gets right there in that climax of his sermons and he I I can't really can't remember what he said but it was so good we all hollered glory to God and I turned around and me and his brother gave each other a high five and then we just kind of looked at each other thank God it was in the back but get so excited that you want to jump up to your feet but are we too dead when a team wins wins the game they haven't won in a while I watched one this past say that this past fall or my favorite team I'll go ahead and say it won a game that had one in 20 years I guess brother Gideon them fans just didn't sit there no they were up we're upping over the walls storming the field this is the field so if something said you like won't you come up here and storm the field let's act like we do at ball games without the drinking Hallelujah glory to God in the highest what we should be seeing won't you when the preacher says something she excites you so we should storm the field preach brother Hallelujah well I haven't seen Church peoples right there on that field they had pictures I hope they're not listening but come to church the next morning and sit on their hands we're on a faith we got a favorite team it's called the Lord Jesus Christ we go for him we're fans of Jesus matter of fact we're Fanatics for him Hallelujah don't worry about Jason's preaching Sunday oh they have no emotion just sit there no excitement to be in church but they'll get these ball games they'll get there two or three hours early to have a tailgate party sit there and talk about their team getting all worked up by the time they get in the stadium they're ready for the game to start what would happen if we would do the same thing we said talk about it brother Luther we'll talk about it all day long we can't wait to come to church what would happen if we come to church two hours early getting ready for the service when brother Tony comes right out here we're ready to have church but Harley's dead coming in all tired Hallelujah I made it to church something I have to do every Wednesday and every Sunday if I don't bro Jason's going to call me the Deacon is going to call me wonder where I'm at shame on us shame on us when we could come to church on the anointing we just sit there would say hallelujah preacher just raise your hands and you'll just go halfway half mast we know what it means with a flag's flying half mast somebody's dead oh Lord have mercy I like to get it get all excited get my oranges a wave and back and forth praise the Lord I want people to know I'm Not Dead I'm alive that's what God wants us to be he wants us to be a lively Church he wants us to be on fire we're not no dead Church when a man of God's up here preach let he know you're alive let him know you're living they were not preaching to a bunch of dead people a bunch of dried up bones well we got some visitors ain't gonna be coming back we are to be Lively stones on fire with God first Peter 2 4 says to whom coming as unto a living Stone disallowed indeed of men but chosen of God and precious ye also has Lively stones to be alive to be quick to breathe check and make sure you're all breathing we're Lively stones Hallelujah we don't need to be sitting here on Earth voted that's not what this means we're Lively you say why should I be Lively why should I act alive Peter says because you are a chosen generation we should be shouting a royal priesthood a holy nation A peculiar people that ye should show forth the Praises of him which has called you out of Darkness that's why we should Shout Hallelujah into His Marvelous Light which in time passed were not a people but are now the people of God one day we weren't one day we were walking dead but now we are the people of God we hadn't obtained Mercy but now we have we're not a dead Church whew I've gone to some Churches dead or doorknobs some of your brothers know what I'm talking about you go to that church they're better you're like what in the world Europe are preaching all you got they just sit here and look at you then you check out their pastor oh he's asleep I've had to wake up the pastors I hope I wasn't that boring it just becomes a tradition to the people come to church every Sunday I better go like I said a minute ago they'll be calling me they just sit there and look at you and you can tell that's their normal life they just come to church it's just normal the way they act it ought to be normal for us to come to church hallelujah praise the Lord happy that we're here not wishing we was at Walmart somewhere or eat down here Dockside eating some fish Hallelujah just a tradition oh Lord I wrote this down I didn't want to forget this don't let this to become a tradition to us just came to church same old same old no fire don't let it become a tradition it's a no emotion at all preachers can be up here preaching their heart out but people just sit there on their hands what we need is a stir and to bring these old bones to life a Revival in our soul I ain't talking about some fanatical emotion not seemed like I am but I'm not I've seen too much of that I've seen too many young people do that too many young people it's sad and I sit and pray dear God let this be real to them let this not be a thing they do to get in front of the church and just dance and run around and you know their lives are not right Lord May something stick with them because dancing ain't going to get you out of here it's going to take a holy ghost fire to burn everything out of you that's the only way you're going to get out of this place a church without a motion is dead we know what brother Brandon said do you need to bury it when you got a dead church we need to bury it Hallelujah we're expecting God to do something for us but remember said but he can't do nothing for us when we're just all drooping around like something half dead if you need a healing check the way you're walking are you walking droopy armed barely making it in the door falling through I'm here Lord Heal Me Hallelujah said this we're just all drooping around like something about half dead he wants a lively church he wants his members in there to be Lively stones build up into the house oh Isaiah 37 3 and he said unto unto me son of man can these bones live I don't know can they that's why he he had a smart answer only thou knowest Lord only thou know if they can again he said to me prophesying to these bones and say unto them oh ye Dry Bones hear the word of the Lord I'm going to speak to Dry Bones tonight hear the word of the Lord not only here but those people on the internet hear the word of the Lord thus saith the Lord got into these bones behold I will cause breath to enter into you and ye shall live to live to revive live forever Hallelujah live forever be quickened be alive be restored to life or health to revive be quick and from sickness from discouragement from faintness from Death to restore I will restore saith the Lord you know every generation has its chance at a Revival every generation we had ours you young people's got yours so what are you going to do with your chance [Music] what are you going to do with it oh they say that every year every year Youth Camp Bethel Youth Camp your chance at Revival they'll say it again next year maybe this this will be

next special meeting you don't even have to wait to Our Youth Camp you could get a Revival right now you can have one tonight you saw you know how will it make me act what will brother and sister so and so say who cares it makes everybody act different when you become alive you act different some people speak in tongues some people jump and Shout some people run around the building some people may not even feel a thing at all but they know there's been a change they can tell a change inside their soul so it's not all based on emotion we all like it makes us feel good will you get that Holy Ghost there's no one that can take it away from you nobody can take it away from you no boyfriend no girlfriend no devil no preacher shame on the preachers Hallelujah They Don't Preach the Holy Ghost

a Revival I want one every day and I will lay sinews upon you and will bring up the flesh upon you and cover you with skin and put breath in you and ye shall live ye shall know that I am the Lord Ezekiel says so I prophesied as I was commanded as I've prophesied there was a noise and that noise right there was voice there was a voice you know like in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mysteries of God should be finished a voices saying come out over my people seven Thunders utter their voices there's a noise the seven Thunders is nothing but the voice of God we hear the voice of God speaking when the voice of God speaks things start shaking Bones start coming together shake the building Lord hear the word of the Lord speak to us Lord let that voice come and behold there was a shaken and the bones come together bone to bone you know we were dead in our sin one day brother Joe going from church to church Ballroom to Bar Room dance hall to dance hall we weren't satisfied we thought we were when we go home late and I said there's got to be something more there's got to be more to this oh but what you didn't know there's something down on the inside of you a seed that was placed before the foundation of the world it was your time to be born you might have walked on this Earth 30 or 40 years you might have been 12. but one day that light struck that seed you become quickened you then your dry bones started rattling together you started shaking under the power of the Holy Ghost Lord shake this building Hallelujah we were just dry bones just walking around all we did was satisfy this flesh but all of a sudden a voice spoke it was the voice of God it was his voice that called you we were dead in sin we were dead men walking but now we're alive forevermore so I prophesied as I was commanded and as I've promised there was a noise behold is shaking when there's a voice there be guaranteed there's going to be some shaking be shaking this sin off your life shaking this off that alert going home and cleaning out your closets throwing away your old videos and your your rock music there's a shaking hear the word of the Lord hahaha oh I started to hear some bones rattling together we gotta speak laughing in them bones and when I beheld all the seniors of the flesh come upon them and the skin covered them above but there was no breath in them then said he unto me prophesying to the wind Hallelujah prophesy son of man and say to the wind thus saith the Lord God come from the Four Winds o breath breathe upon these that was slain that they may live that's what we scream about we get up here oh Winds of the Earth blow upon these people breathe upon us that's the Breath of God what happened Genesis 2 7. God formed Man Out of the Dust of the ground and breathed on him the breath of life he became a living soul First Corinthians 15 45 the first man Adam was made a living soul Hallelujah the last Adam was a quickening spirit Adam died God breathed the life into Adam he died but not this Adam he's got quickening spirits life-giving that's what Quicken spirit means life-giving Jesus has life-given Spirit he's here to give you life tonight foreign disciples were gathered at church the morning of the Resurrection Sunday they came to church Jesus appeared there it's me don't be afraid look at my hands you see the scars only one person was missing out of that meeting Thomas missed something because Jesus gave us his go into the world you're gonna go do this and he breathed on them and says receive ye the Holy Ghost Thomas missed that oh the disciples were so excited we received the Holy Ghost God himself breathed on me they were happy we should be happy tonight Hallelujah God breathed on me receive ye the Holy Ghost I guarantee brother Thomas was there the next service he didn't miss it Reverend says the church is a mystical Body of Christ born of the Breath of God Church of God is born of the Breath of God God breathed breath into them nostrils spiritually of Adam and he became a living Soul the true Pentecostal Church is born by the Breath of God I like the way he says true not 1906 Pentecost but the true Pentecostal Church and the same day at evening during the being the first day of the week when the doors were shut the disciples were assembled they fit for fear of the Jews Jesus came and stood in the midst of them and said to them peace be unto you and when he had showed them his hands his side the disciples were glad when they saw the Lord and then Jesus said to them peace be unto you as my father has sent me so send are you watch the father that sent him within him and Jesus when he sends a disciple he goes in him glory to God and when he had said this he breathed on them and says receive ye the Holy Ghost Church borned of the Breath of God brother says when this statue is molded itself up there in that condition God breathes breath upon them they received the Holy Ghost then you are a son of God we're not till God breathes on us they received the Holy Ghost then you are a son of God you're born into the Church of the Living God born by the Breath of God God breathed upon them and said receive ye the Holy Ghost not coming John he says put your name in put your name on there when you soup suppers and all that goes with it you join the lodge you can join a Methodist Lodge a Baptist Lodge a presbyterian Lodge at Catholic Lodge or Pentecostal Lodge or a message Lodge anything you want to join but you're not but we're not joining you're just joining the lodge but when you become a child of God you are born by the Breath of God oh if you find ourselves dying come up here let God breathe on you oh we need to just tell the Lord Lord revive us revive us again Lord send the Revival we're dying some of us see spiritual mouth-to-mouth we're so dead we're lifeless Breathe on Me God 's 120 went in Upper Room when the sound of a mighty Russian wind what happened the Breath of God came into the room Acts 2 1 says when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all in one Accord in one place and suddenly subtly Hallelujah we heard a good mess this past weekend and brother Josh is on suddenly suddenly there came a sound from heaven as a Russian Mighty Wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting you notice this first there came a sound from Heaven as a rushy Mighty Wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting Lord let that sound of a Russian Mighty wind blow through this building fill this house where we are sitting foreign tongues like as a fire and is set up on each one of them and they were filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance Hallelujah they had a power surge you remember years ago preached on the power surge what happens when somebody comes in unity when everybody's in one Accord it's Unity that's what happens a power surge which is an unexpected temporary uncontrollable increase in current or voltage in electrical circuit a voltage Spike that's what happens when you the with the lights are off it's dark in here there's a wire that runs from a panel box to that light switch to these lights right here but they won't get turned on you will have lights until you go flip the switch and when you do there's a power surge that runs through that box through that switch lights come on if you're sitting here in darkness I know a man who could turn on the light it's a power surge that's what happens when the Holy Ghost goes through you you get an uncontrollable temporary uncontrollable use of our body if I make us jump up and down and run around the building Hallelujah you might even speak in tongues well you might even just sit and cry power surge I always like to say this right after this a lot of us has got surge protectors we know what surge protectors do when a power comes through it it drains it so your computers and everything else won't get no no damage that's what some of us guys got a bunch of surge protectors when the Holy Ghost God's moving I can't act like that Lord dead men candies bolds live that's what brings a bones to life a power surge Lord sweep to the building tonight give us a power search give us something to put life back in these bones Hallelujah it is a rising of the Sun so many good quotes in that I ain't gonna read all of them I am so glad there is a 10 000 octane power the word of God and a holy ghost to light it up and to resurrect the power of God into a man's life or a woman's life or into a church they shoved that Cadillac down the road John you're under Dynamic power of the Holy Ghost which came back and was way during the people in the day of Pentecost making him the same yesterday today and forever if it made them act wild then it's going to make you act wild now Hallelujah I was giving away his brother dick says don't get nervous then said he unto me prophesy unto the wind son of man and say to the wind thus saith the Lord God come from the Four Winds and breathe upon these that were slain that they may breathe they may live again oh oh that's why I want to say Lord blow among these people blow Among Us Lord and I got myself here oh we need that Spirit that's going to Quicken us Ephesians 3 5 even when we were dead in sin hath quickened us together with Christ by grace are ye saved Robert said in God provided place if the spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead be in you it will also Quicken your mortal bodies if the spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead be in you it'll also Quicken your mortal body hallelujah quickening what does that word quick mean the Greek word means to be brought to life after death Hallelujah that's the Gate of worship he says worship it in the spirit of the truth mechanics and Dynamics together if the spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you it will Quicken your mortal bodies it will make you alive because it's all because it's already life and when it comes into your body it brings your whole body subject to it subject to what the word of God who all we need we need the Dynamics to strike the mechanics that's what a lot of us just got only God's just a bunch of mechanics this is one of the reasons for the man's prayer meeting every Thursday night and by the way men's prayer meet tomorrow night at six o'clock right here if you ain't been here you don't know what you're missing but that's the goal of what we pray every Thursday night Lord let the dynamic strike the mechanics we can just have all the mechanics we want we can be in a car we can have nice seats we have a motor in there oh beautiful color brand new vehicle but it's not going to run it ain't got a spark but go ahead and put some gasoline in it turn the key and watch that thing go Hallelujah so if you want if you Brothers want this in your families please come that was free but we can't work it up we can't produce a Revival on our own God has to do it okay I got a quote for that that's Sovereign but around says that's what God does and he alone has a right to send a Revival not get the mechanics together it's it's to pray for God to send the Dynamics he only reveals his word to those that are predestinated wow but the mechanics is all right but the mechanics won't move it it takes the Dynamics to move it you can build an automobile put find seats in it make fine Pistons proved by science what it can do but unless the Dynamics is in there she's just a dead piece of goods that's why we are sitting here we can be all mechanical raise your hands brother Matt does a good job of this raise your hands let's worship God again he says that 20 times the service maybe he's trying to get some life in you he didn't tell me say it Hallelujah but unless the Dynamics is there she's just a dead piece of good you're like in the Welsh Revival we know these men went over over to England looking for it says can you tell us where the Welsh Revival is because I'm him because since somebody was coming to that door and says hey where's the bride's Revival are you looking at it you're looking at the bride's Revival because I'm in a Revival every day why because the Dynamics they struck the mechanics it's a promise that's the mechanics but let God in his Sovereign Grace just speak to some little nitwit to some little nobody to let his Spirit fall into the City and men can't go to work women can't wash dishes the maids can't make the bed they're screaming and crying with their hands up in the air that's Revival and then he says that's the will of God the will of God is to go around crying and screaming and raising our hands up in the air so I prophesied as he commanded me and the breath Came Upon them and they lived and stood upon their feet and exceeded great Army I'm going to speak and say listen hear the word of the Lord wins four winds blow upon these people let these bones come to life what happens you become a great Army that you're the Invincible Army that no devil can beat you no devil can stand in your way that's what gives you power to kick around the devil Hallelujah Invincible Army we're called from the dead we're Lively Stones we're a lively Church there's a festival of Miracles going on here in this town y'all heard of it they they broadcast miracles all kinds of Miracles fire then they they it shows it shows the guy the video I see shows a guy touching people and they start rolling around the floor on fire and then they didn't

goes out a wildfire will go out don't you'll hear these wildfires up in Canada oh they've been burning for weeks they're eventually going to burn out but we're going to fire they'll never burn out Hallelujah one of these mornings we're going to need the Dynamics we're going to need that octane boost that octane power to boost us off of this Earth we're astronauts we're not in an airplane we don't have to have a big Runway to lift us off the sky all we got to do we got that power inside of us When God says It's Time Boom you talk about a sonic boom you think that's Sonic booms out here these planes flying over all day that ain't nothing to what's coming oh but astronaut he can be in his rocket he can be sitting back here looking toward the skies say that star right there that's where I'm going he can have it into the rocket launcher be sitting there has all the mechanics everything's working headlights are working the heat and air is working he's checked everything but until somebody lost that engine somebody puts a fire in that rocket it ain't going nowhere Dry Bones until you come alive and get a boost of power we ain't going nowhere I say we lord send us a Revival oh but you know what happens when that fire starts that he steals that thing starts shaking foreign they hear ten nine eight seven six five four engine check check this check that we're ready to go three

we're trusting and believing that you're going to do it right now in the name of Jesus Christ amen hallelujah thank you [Music] anybody got any testimonies [Music] um so as most of you know me and Micah are working on renovating our house um right now so we were looking for a set of cabinets which is very expensive and um so the cheapest ones we were able to find were eight thousand dollars and we still weren't able to afford that so I really wanted cabinets because it was really hard to have a kitchen without cabinets so um I started praying and I was like Lord if you can just give us a set of cabinets a full set under just five thousand dollars five thousand dollars or less we can work with that so I just started praying for him to find us some cheap cabinets so we get a text from Katie Watkins and she was she happened to be at this Restore store it sells a bunch of household items for really cheap there was a full set of cabinets there and she was like these are really cheap nice set of cabinets if you guys want to come look at them so we went over there and looked and they ended up working out they were just under a thousand dollars so we got a full set of cabinets for just under a thousand dollars so I thank God for that [Applause] [Music] most of you probably know Monday evening around 5 30. my heart went out of rhythm and it was beaten at 140 to 143 beats a minute you couldn't get it to slow down and the doctor had given me medication to take in case that ever happened and I took all the medication I could take it still wasn't slowing it down so we kept praying and praying we went to bed at two o'clock it was seemed like it was getting worse and I woke right up and I said we've got to go to the emergency room this is not this isn't right it felt like my heart was quivering kind of like when you have a jerking muscle in your arm or something and it was beating really fast and so we went to emergency room we got in there and brother Andrew called was able to get us in quickly thank goodness and so he gets us in there and they start putting all these wires and everything all over me and they tell me that my heart is in what they call a flutter where it wasn't just running fast it was fluttering while it was going fast and I feel like I couldn't breathe sometimes and it was just a very scary situation and they said Dr smallheiser your heart doctor will be in in the morning but we're going to have to give you a certain kind of medicine they said we have five tubes of medicine we can give you to try to slow this down well they gave me two and it slowed it down to 84 beats a minute but that's as slow as it would go so they put me in another room and it started going back up again I got up to go to the bathroom and it started going up again and it went back up to 140 again and so they put me back in bed and they gave me another syringe of that medicine it brought it back down to 84 and they said we're gonna have to give you another one and so they gave me another one still didn't bring it down past 84 it was still 84. and so they said we're gonna have to put you on a drip so they put me on a drip and all night my heart was racing anywhere from 80 it would go up to 108 to 140 back down to 70 back up to 80. it was just all night long it was like this and so I started praying and I said Lord before Dr smallheiser gets here please give me a regular heartbeat and anybody walking past my room probably thought there was a crazy person in there because I just started praying out loud I didn't care who hurt me I didn't care what was going on around me all I knew was I needed help and every time my heart rate would go down to 60 and it would be there for a couple of seconds it would go back up again and I would literally yell out at Satan and I'd say no you can't do this because I said you can't and Jesus gives me authority over it and you can't do this so stop it and I was literally yelling like that and I know if somebody walked past the room they probably thought a crazy person was in there but I did not care and finally at six o'clock I looked up at the Monitor and I noticed my heart wasn't doing that anymore and I thought maybe the drip kicked in or something I don't something's different and so um the doctor comes in at a little bit before seven and he looks at the Monitor and he looks at me and he's kind of a funny man he kind of cracks me up but he's kind of in his move sort of and it's very funny but he's looking at me and he looks at the Monitor and he looks at me again and he says nope that's not what's going on and he says your EKG says you were in a flutter but you're not you're having AFib and we got to fix this now so he leaves the room and then he comes back if or the nurse comes in a few minutes later and she goes you're in sinus rhythm she said you're perfect everything's fine and it hit me that before he came in there it was the prayer that I prayed that it was perfectly in Rhythm and it was an afib but they said that you could somehow have a fast heart rate and still be in sinus rhythm I don't understand how that works but anyways I was in sinus rhythm even though it was running a little bit fast so anyways um they admitted me into the hospital and I was praying and I said Lord I said I don't want to have to be in here I'm tired I want to go home to my own bed can you please fix it where I can go home tonight so they put me in there and they admitted me they changed me into a room they had me in there and they came in kept doing all the tests and all the things and they kept saying everything looks great you're fine everything's wonderful at I think it was at 12 o'clock the nurse come in there and she said I don't know what's happened but she said they're allowing you to go home they said I was not expecting this at all and every doctor and nurse that came in there to look at me they said I was not expecting him to let you go home but he's letting you go home so I went home at two o'clock and I have been pretty much okay since I'm tired but I'm doing well and I thank the Lord for that and I thank you all for your prayers and I'm sorry I took so long talking about this but I really appreciate your all's prayers and and brother Jason was such an encouragement to me kept sending me text messages and encouraging me and I really appreciate that [Applause] [Music] Matthew wanted me to this um Ashley I've got at least two maybe three a couple weeks ago maybe two or three months ago my elbow and arm was very inflamed and so much that I ordered a sleeve and I leave night and day and it didn't get better and I I believe in praying for myself it didn't get better and one night here at church I thought well call for the Elders of the church and all y'all came up remember where the Lord healed my arm but my back um most of you don't know a few of you do 17 years ago I had back surgery I've got rods in my back those rods have screws in them so here be four weeks tonight I got up on Wednesday morning I couldn't move I was in awful shape and so I kind of rested and got a little bit better and then I got worse Katie took me to the my regular doctor and he gave me a steroid shot and six days of steroids and an x-ray so then I said it was your back so I went to my orthopedic doctor and he done a back X-ray on me while I was in that doctor's office I got a call the family had been called in from my sister it wasn't very hard for me to lose most of you know my sister Jewel she was so happy to go and I'm thrilled for her but I sure miss her so anyway the doctor took an x-ray of my back the orthopedic he showed me the X-ray he called in the spinal surgeon that was there and they looked at the X-ray and in my rods in my back I have 10 rods the screws were out I could see them you know what a screw looks like when it's loose and it really bothered the doctor and he said well I was really hoping it'd be your help because that's his specialty he said but somehow another those screws have come out so I'm thinking oh my goodness what do you do with screws loosen your back and plus I had a pinched nerve and a few other things and so I was really concerned not another surgery I'm 82 years old that's so then then he sent me then to my spine doctor the one that done the surgery and I went to him and he done my back X right now I start therapy money and I hate therapy but I'm gonna go and I am so much improved I was able to come back to church so he took a back x-ray screws are back in place I do not have to have surgery I don't y'all prayed for me and I appreciate but the greatest thing I've had this burden on for my neighbors ever since I've been there the Lord's given me some of the best and the one that I've I pray for him every day but this one I really wanted to really talk to her that one goes to church this this one doesn't a good person and today and I've said Lord I'd love to talk to her just me and her but never got a change so today I've been taking it easy trying not to set myself back again because I asked Katie I was in I was in agonizing pain to say the least and so today I sitting out on the porch a little bit here she come she sat down on the porch with me and God just opened I just had the best time talking to her about the script y'all pray for her I'd love to see her saved you know so anyway that you prayed Brother Brad so I thank y'all for your prayers and continue to pray and pray for my brother this is unexpected it's totally unexpected so God bless thank you [Applause] I was with my nephew Seth today and we were trying to get my old janky truck running and uh we sat out there for like an hour in the hot sun trying to get it going and uh I I said Seth did you pray and he said yeah and I said I prayed too and he said uh and then I said brother Brandon said in the message presuming that uh that a man came to him and said brother bring him if you pray I'll uh he said I think you my truck will run just fine or whatever or it was his car or whatever and so he uh he prayed and he said brother Brandon said yes truck ran just fine and anyway uh so we sat there and sat there and kept trying to get it kept trying to get it holding the faith and anyway uh about the last time that I was going to try and start the truck I was about to leave and uh I went and turned the key in just as I did sass it literally right as he said and threw his arms up so I thought that was neat and I would share it so foreign from Brother Jack I was supposed to have brother Jack who's streaming and I was supposed to have him give this testimony Sunday and it totally slipped my mind and he texted me before you remember the man that we had uh prayer cloth that all the brothers came up here mother Jack had a friend brother Harry who had a brain tumor and brother Jack sister Kathy we're going to go down there and give brother Harry that that prayer cloth we prayed over and so there's a pretty miraculous testimony that came from that and so brother Jack was just wanted to share that how this man who started with a brain tumor uh turned into a brain infection couldn't talk couldn't uh do anything for a week and a half but God raised him up completely healed him and so brother brother Jack says brother Harry had a real bad head pain crying could not get relief ambulance went to pick him up at work took him to Brunswick Hospital found out he had a brain tumor took him to Savannah hospital they found out it was a brain infection had a tube on his throat he was like a dead man when I went to the hospital with with the prayer cloth and the angel of the Lord went before us I truly believe that and sister Kathy walk right in nobody checked us in we went right to him and prayed place the prayer cloth on him for a week in three days three days later he called me to talk to me and thanked me for having faith for him when he could not have faith for himself I told him it was the prayers of the whole body of Christ that man is now doing some speech Rehabilitation and he said brother Jack when I get out of here I'm coming to your church amen hallelujah Give the Lord a hand for that he says prayer no doubt and I believe this he says prayer no doubt is more powerful than all the atomic bombs put together tell Caleb and sister Joy all things are truly possible for believers amen why don't we give the Lord another handful all right God's sure mindful no matter what it is could be a set of cabinets heart trucks backs sister Gene I've been I've been in those surgeries I assist the doctors in those screws and rods that's that's no no fun thing to have to deal with see them come back bad praise the Lord he's a Healer everybody okay you got fire in your bones [Music] let your face show it [Music] turn around shake hands you can be dismissed come back on Sunday morning once like a bird in prison I dwell no freedom from my sorrow I failed
