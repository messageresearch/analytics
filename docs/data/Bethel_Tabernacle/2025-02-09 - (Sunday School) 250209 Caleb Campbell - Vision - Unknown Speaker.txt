TRANSCRIPT
========================================
God bless you all this morning amen if we can just stand and we're going to open up our Bibles this morning and read one verse out of Proverbs and that verse is in Proverbs 29 and verse 18 Proverbs 29:8 it says where there is no vision the people perish but he that keepeth the law happy is he amen let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you for this day Lord we thank you just for the privilege of being able to come into your house Lord and worship together Lord I just pray that you could open up this word to us Lord just in a teaching manner this morning Father unveil your word to us we love you and we ask it in Jesus name amen God bless you as you take your seats this morning so I want to speak a little bit on uh on that scripture here where there is no vision the people perish but he that keepeth the law happy is he you know one of the most important things in our walk with the Lord is spiritual growth and maturity in the word you know that's what we're constantly striving for um this opening verse this morning speaks of a topic that I would just want to spend a few minutes on and it speaks of vision now it in the specific Greek or Hebrew translation of the word in this particular verse speaks more of a a prophetic Vision or uh a sense of Prophecy and Revelation but I'd like to take a more simple approach if I could on just having Vision spiritually speaking amen one definition of that word vision is the ability to think about or plan the future with imagination or wisdom think about or plan the future with imagination or wisdom I believe that in order to cultivate your future to help nurture and grow yourself spiritually it's Paramount that you have a certain amount of vision in our lives and in order for us to have Vision or in order for you to have vision for something you have to plan and and set goals so I think it's really an important thing to create goals spiritually in our lives I believe that's one of the ways that we can grow as Christians amen you know and I know that I know that the Lord Works in in trials and testings and I know that you know God uses those to train us for our future but he has already crafted something something totally and completely perfect something that leads you something that inspires you something that in it quickens you and it's something that's not just words on a page and it has the power of life and death in it amen and that's the word and uh you know we read it we absorb it we apply it then God inspires it and then it Quicken he quickens it in your life to make it a reality amen and so as much as trials and testings train us he has a word that trains us and I think that's one of the most important things that we how we can learn is through his word amen through the word that he's given through this and through the word of our day amen um there's an example I have this morning that kind of was where my inspiration came from for this it's something natural but I want to type it spiritually you know sometimes we have a vision of something in our minds um that we want to accomplish some task that we want to do um just naturally you know and I have this I have this little area in my in my backyard it's actually technically not my property um it's a part of a closed down uh golf course that closed down in our neighborhood probably 10 years ago um you know and so one or two of my neighbors on you know one side of me they actually take care of of you know their their portion of of that just and it what I've noticed over the years is it actually makes their yard look bigger and nicer and it's technically not their property but it's an extension of their property and it makes it look better and so this is something you know and it's not incredibly large either it's maybe 20 by 20 or or whatever um but ever since I moved in we've been in the house like 4 and a half years it's something that you know I've had this thought in my mind that I want I would like to take care of ours the same way that they take care of theirs similar to that way because you know I think it makes it look nice and you know I I think maybe it'll make it look even bigger and more open and you know but for in order for me to have done that because it was a thought in my mind to do it for so long but in order for me to do it I had to take a step towards doing that and um you know I knew that there was going to be quite a bit of work involved because there's been you know eight nine ten years of weeds and brush and things that haven't been you know taken care of so I knew that it was going to be some work to get to the point where you know I could just maintain it like I maintain my yard so there was going to be some work involved in that so all I did was I naturally I took a I took one step forward and I started you know so I I began to cut back the weeds and I I Rak out all the brush and the pine cones and and all all of everything else and truly it was layers and layers and I did did this over the span of several weeks um because you know anybody with kids knows that time is precious and uh it was layers and layers and so one thing that I had is I did have a vision of kind of what I wanted it to look like because I had an idea I was I looked at my neighbors and his is very wellmaintained it looks just like his yard he doesn't water it but he mows it and it just looks really nice so I had a vision in mind of what I wanted it to look like and so I want to I want you to catch some things in this this story this morning now after every stage of or every layer that I took out if you were if you were to walk past this particular area and and look at it at the stage of development that it was in you wouldn't have been able to see the beauty that I saw but because I had a vision of what I saw before amen me we you know me and my wife has have been looking at it for years out outside of our back porch and we've watched the brush and you know just to be honest sometimes we'll throw sticks over there just because it's in our yard so and that's not you know that's probably not the best thing to do but that's just something we did so it's something we looked at for years so after every layer or every every time I went out there and I Rak and I spent a few hours here and a few hours there I would look out at this patch and I would see how much better it looked than when I started amen and so sometimes in our stages of development spiritually speaking you know other people may be walking by you you know just think spiritually this morning and they may not completely understand or they may not see the growth but if you can look at where you started from you can see that I am growing the Lord is taking weeds out of my life he's taking he's cultivating us right and so I I saw and I saw the the potential you know because I had out of vision I had an idea of what I was working towards and you know sometimes the trouble with doing certain things is that if we don't keep our mind or our eyes focused on the vision that we had when we started and we're only viewing things during the stages of development it can be really discouraging you know when you're when you're learning you know um when you're being trained as a Christian when you're when you're being matured in your walk with Christ you know sometimes you you can get discouraged because what we do as people is we look at another person men we look at you know well this person doesn't seem to have those kinds of flaws that I might have or this person seems to be so much further along than I am but it's because we're looking at more of an unfinished product and when you're looking at an unfinished product it doesn't always look so good in the process you know and the so the first few stages of of what I'd like to call my Campbell beautification project in my in my backyard it really didn't look like much you know like I said if you've seen it before um you know and you were and you didn't see it before you were just freshly walking by it probably looked pretty terrible but at each stage I was able to appreciate every uh every layer that I was able to take out and I looked past and you can ask my wife I really did this I looked after every time I went out there I looked out past our back porch and I and I admired the work that I did because I knew it took it took time it took effort you know and it really I mean it it was more of an extension of my property but it something something I knew that it would help you know make it look better and so I know this is Elementary this morning but you know sometimes spiritual growth in our life can you know it might be the same thing others might see it and they may not quite understand or even worse like we were talking about we begin to compare it to somebody else and we're not called to do that you don't compare yourself with another person you look at the word amen we look at what God has envisioned for us in the word and and on one side of that I believe it's it's awesome thing to have an exam have examples to look up to you know having parents that love the Lord or people that you admire you know you look at you know pastor and and you I think those things you know people that have such a prayer life you know or you know their character and and and being able to admire those those fine qualities but we're not supposed to compare ourselves to them you know had I compared what I was doing with what my neighbor had already done it would have been a pitiful comparison because he's been maintaining that for 10 years and it already has you know it already has everything it needs all it needs right now is just constant maintenance but he didn't have to work as hard because he started earlier and so it's never good to compare yourself to your brother or sister because their situation is different than yours amen maybe God called them at a different time than he called you you know maybe maybe even this maybe there maybe they've been cultivating their Garden you know spiritually speaking for 20 or 30 years maybe they've grown in maturity and they're at a different place than you are and now they've reached a great place of maturity in the word and you may not be there but that's okay because that and that shouldn't discourage us because you will get there God has a vision of you and you will get to that point the the point is to keep your vision in the word not on somebody else amen you know you know I just was thinking this morning you know I so I so greatly I admire and respect these brothers who who bring the word with with years of study and and dedication they have such a depth of knowledge of the message and how they bring the word forth and they with such prowess and and skill as they do but that doesn't discourage me just because I can't do it that way it inspires me amen Because by the help and the grace of God maybe one day I'll be there amen and it's not that I'm striving to to be as great as they are I just want to be as much as God called me to be amen and that's what our goal is to be as much as God called us to be in our potential amen you know and I think Believers as Believers we should set goals spiritually I I believe we should set goals in our life you know set goals in your walk with God sometimes daily or even weekly and challenge yourself to new things you know maybe read the Bible in a 100 days or go through the church age book in a in a week or whatever it is set attainable goals and watch the Lord cultivate and grow you in maturity and in wisdom you know you know we're not I've said this before but you know you're not born again and then the very next day you're fully mature Christians that's just not the way it works sometimes I wish it was that way but that's just not the way it works amen God trains us and of course a part of that is testings and trials but I'm under the belief that even a a bigger part of that is dedication to his word amen delight yourself in the Lord meditate on it day and night amen he will establish you his word is what what matures you reading it and studying it and applying it you know meditating on it what he does is he takes the words that you know the difference between you know a Believer and an unbeliever reading the Bible or reading the word is that you know he can Quicken these words in your life and make it a living reality amen if there's nothing in there calling out to this then it can't become a living reality but because you are part of the word when you read this God makes it a living reality for you amen and in order to cultivate that to happen you need to read it and study and apply yourself to it amen and and remember that as you grow we aren't to look at our neighbor as your mark amen we are to look at the word and you know every once in a while I think it's good to maybe look back at where you started look at how far you've come look at all the the weeds and the nonsense that God has pulled out from your life and and how much you've gained in the process you know I believe much of of the grow that we you know attain spiritually just comes from the process Alone um you know many people many times you know I've heard it say you know it's all about getting to the destination you know and I don't know how the saying goes but the journey to the destination is really what impacts you to reach the goal because it's the day-to- day it's the every day amen of your life um The Grind of being Christian and reading the word and and allowing the Lord to uh pluck things out of your life that that maybe have hindered you and then watching watching that word grow in your life and in your family's life and watching him change and and nurture that you know um where there is no vision the people perish when you get when you get to live in a Christian Life every day and you have no vision it can actually truly hinder you uh I want to contrast something here this morning this is this is different than when Jesus said take no thought for tomorrow amen you know because we're supposed to trust God for these things but setting goals and planning you know spiritually speaking even Naturally Speaking is something that the word teaches us to do even brother brandham taught us that we are to plan as if he won't come for 100 years but live as if he's coming today right and I'm not so much talking about the natural things you know although it's great to plan for the natural but Focus the focus is having a vision on how you want to grow spirit spiritually you know and one of the I mean just some simple Concepts this morning you know it's it's it's really a good thing to be honest with yourself you know I think if we're honest with ourselves we wouldn't need or shouldn't need others to point out our flaws we can pretty much recognize what they are amen if you really reflect on your daytoday you can you know take account for yourself and say I really want to grow in this area you know I may not be as mature as I want to be in this area you know I have I have some some things I want to pluck up or I want to change or I want to grow in and and you know I think we're um I don't think anybody's fooling anybody if you think you're perfect and you don't have room to grow we all have areas that we need growth in amen some of us are further along and some of us are more mature and that's okay but you know just f look at yourself reflect on what it is that you want to grow on and then focus on on that area maybe you know uh our temper is a little red hot sometimes or maybe we patience or you know maybe even our pride needs a little adjustment you know I'm not going to start just putting all these things because there's just a whole list but whatever it is just start with those things today um you know we know we're not perfect yet God knows we're not perfect yet so you know if you just if you start uh if you need a starting point today start with that list take those things to the Lord in prayer you know start with a list um you know and be sincere with it have have the right attitude about it and and then then begin to to cultivate a betting ground that the Lord could actually change that characteristic in you because if you go with if you go at it with an attitude well I'm just never gonna I'm just not never going to change you know this is just the way that I am if you have that kind of attitude about it then how the how is the Lord ever going to change you you need to be able to have a humble heart and say maybe this is the way that I am maybe I do have a gene pool that isn't the greatest or maybe maybe this maybe that but I don't want to be that way Lord I want you to change me I want you to grow me and I believe that he's faithful to do that God he said to Sarah is there anything impos is there anything too hard for the Lord no there's nothing too hard for the Lord amen and um you know like I said just be humble about it and then some of the just the basic concepts is is search it out in the word you know whatever flaw it is I'm sure somebody had the same flaw in scripture and find out what the Lord did for them to change their heart in that matter amen that's just a very simple concept but um you know I was thinking about uh Abraham yesterday and and his growth you know if you think about Abraham think about this he lied about Sarah being his wife at two separate occasions you know and I think about how his wife must have thought about him at that point in his life it seems like a pretty cowardly move to do that you know but yet Abraham grew so much and Sarah had so much respect for him and reverence for him at at a later point in his life that Sarah actually called him Lord you know meaning I reverence him and I respect him you know how did he get from point A to point B God matured him God grew him God God changed him amen he didn't I was thinking about Josiah you know I preached on that last time I I I preached here and you know Josiah he started reigning at eight years old just a child um by the but by the end of his kingdom he had gained so much respect by the people for for his character and by what he did that the entire Kingdom if you go read the end of that book the entire Kingdom assembled together listened to him as he had the Scrolls read and and they just had such a deep reverence for him I'm sure that there was some people who were pretty skeptical in his kingdom that an eight-year-old was going to Reign I mean just think naturally you know this eight-year-old what what is he going to do for the kingdom but God trained him and matured him and he made some pretty great decisions along the way because God inspired his heart and then by the end of his ministry you know we all have Ministries by the end of his ministry they had a deep reverence and a deep respect for him but if he would have went to the temple at age8 and tried to get them to do this would he have had that same maturity would have he had that same respect probably not but the god used it and changed him he and God used him in a big way amen um so I think it's I think it's important you know to set goals spiritually if you don't have a a vision for your life you know in areas that you want to grow and mature in the word and actually set goals to accomplish them you know the scripture says you know you're you're going to perish spiritually you'll wither away you'll never have motivation you'll never uh you know those types of things when you do those things they can actually motivate you you know when I set a goal of you know I want to start uh you know try to read the church age book once a year I don't cross that off in my mind until I'm finished with it even if it takes me weeks and then I always get something new out of it amen and you know when you set goals in your mind to grow and mature in his word I promise you'll never be disappointed in that you know you you might get disappointed in yourself on how you're achieving that goal but you'll never be disappointed on the effects that it has in your life if if you stick with it amen the and the last part of that scripture says it like this happy is he that keepeth the law you know and I I thought about this this verse of scripture I think can actually be applied as medicine in your life it's it's an allnatural anti-depressant because when we have a vision when we keep our minds in the word our thoughts can begin to shift direction towards positivity um you know and I have this quote a brother shared with me the other day and I felt like it kind of dovetailed with this scripture um it talks about keeping your mind alert to the word one of Satan's uh biggest Avenues I believe that he uses in people is when they you know have empty Minds you know people who just spend alone time with with their own thoughts because that's a prime time for the enemy to plant things in your mind that you can then dwell on and then once you start going down that path dwelling on the wrong thing it can be a slippery slope in the wrong direction right so and we're Christians so we're built so that the word can be planted in our minds not so we can just have empty minds but so the word can go in our minds that it can grow in our minds seed in our hearts then you know quicken in our souls right and um brother Brandon preached it preached this message pursuing and he's talking about experiences and he says you know uh 1962 presuming and it's in paragraph 67 it says you know I heard someone was in a meeting here some time ago and someone said just let your mind go blank now just look right straight up towards the skies let your mind go blank and you'll get an experience and no doubt but what you that's right but you get an experience but what an experience you see when you do that you're just opening your soul to Satan you just open your soul to Satan he'll give you something that's true but I think a person coming to Christ should come with all the intelligence they got and quoting in their mind when they come to him every promise in the scripture keep your mind alert when you come to Christ don't let it go blank the devil will make you do anything see so and he's talking about specifically exper experiences you know and he's pointing out how you know specifically like you know when a Pentecostal would have you know they speak in tongues and then they have an experience and they thought that that was the that was the key you have the Holy Ghost is speaking in tongues and and you know the devil can mimic that type of thing but just just to to bring it into a more simple he said um keep your mind alert when you come to Christ don't let it go blank because when the enemy come in comes in your mind and when you're you're just not you're not dwelling on the word and you're just D dwelling on natural things your mind just begins to drift and as it drifts then the enemy has this portal that he gets into and then he starts to to plant seeds in your mind and those things are just I mean it happens to all of us but those are those are how the enemy ends up wrecking your future down the road because it starts with just thoughts and then those thoughts lead into actions and those actions lead to more just chaos right so if you just keep your mind on the word when you have when you have that time then it just creates an atmosphere for the Lord to be able to to to grow you and to mature you amen um don't let it you know don't don't don't just leave it blank in other the worlds sometimes you just need to to clear your mind well that's that's okay you clear your mind and then fill it with the word amen amen um do you love the Lord amen good I do too um and just a little update for my project this morning I was telling you about in my backyard I think it looks pretty good um I I still don't think it looks as good as my neighbor um but that's okay it's definitely progress from when I started amen so so set goals um on how and where you want to grow and and this could just be this part could just be for for the younger people but maybe there's something that you haven't completely understood maybe it was some Doctrine or or some scripture search it out study it uh you know meditate on it maybe there's a book in the Bible that you've never searched out and read through and studied make strides to do that and get get a vision on areas that you want to improve on you know I I remember back and it not like it was a long time ago but when I when I first started studying the message and I used to think how in the world am I ever going to take all this in you know but the Lord and I still haven't but you know the Lord takes you through things and he grows you in your understanding and the more you hear something Faith cometh by hearing and then hearing of the word of God and God just increases you in your understanding and it's not going to you're not going to read uh you know the whole Bible through one time and understand it all I promise you you're not going to read one message through and then and catch everything that God wants you to catch it's compounding amen it's continual it's inspired it's it's Revelation you know so um but but Concepts that used to seem to me like so difficult to understand or seem like that they were just these great far off Mysteries or they were only for people who who who really study the word or they were just for preachers that that was that's the enemy working it's for you if it's in the word it's for you amen if it's in the message it's for you don't let the enemy think that you just you just uh set goals set attainable goals in your life to make strides to do to do that amen it's for all of us my my dad and I and i' I've said this a lot I wanted to just say this at the end my dad and I like to send uh each other words of the day and so my word of the day today if you haven't realized is cultivate and uh you know and besides in farming and and gardening to cultivate to Divine is to nurture and help grow or apply oneself to improving or developing spiritually this morning cultivate your future spiritually amen let's pray Heavenly Father we just thank you for this day Lord we love you and we just ask that you'd help us apply the word that we heard Lord I pray for the ministering of the word today Lord may it just father quicken in our souls we pray we love you in Jesus name amen God bless
