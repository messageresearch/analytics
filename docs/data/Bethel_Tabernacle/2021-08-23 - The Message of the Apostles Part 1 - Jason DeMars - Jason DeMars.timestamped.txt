[0:00] for everyone from my phone
[0:05] all right let's pray
[0:07] heavenly father we just come before you
[0:08] now lord and we're so thankful for your
[0:10] word i pray your light
[0:13] would shine in the darkness lord
[0:16] we're living in a
[0:18] uh
[0:19] exceptionally
[0:21] evil age lord and
[0:23] but i take great courage
[0:26] knowing that when the enemy comes in
[0:28] like a flood the spirit of god will
[0:29] raise a standard against it lord and
[0:33] we believe that your bride is being
[0:35] raised up so that the spirit of god
[0:37] could
[0:39] speak
[0:40] and
[0:41] and portray a standard
[0:44] through us lord
[0:46] help us to that end
[0:48] fill us with your spirit fill us with
[0:50] your wisdom
[0:51] fill us with your strength lord to stand
[0:53] in this evil day we ask in jesus name
[0:56] amen god bless you
[0:58] i'm going to start
[1:00] a topic called the message of the
[1:02] apostles
[1:03] this is part one
[1:06] and
[1:07] i'm going to read from second
[1:09] corinthians 5 17.
[1:16] therefore
[1:17] if any man be in christ
[1:19] he's a new creature or a new creation
[1:23] old things are passed away
[1:25] behold
[1:26] all things are become new
[1:29] amen you can be seated
[1:32] so
[1:33] i'm entitling this the message of the
[1:36] apostles
[1:38] because
[1:39] that's the authoritative message of the
[1:42] church
[1:43] that's what we're being called back to
[1:46] now i'm not gonna i'm i don't want to go
[1:48] into
[1:49] every single doctrine that's not what
[1:51] this is about
[1:52] in in in this topic
[1:55] more more looking at it like this
[1:59] there's a core
[2:00] reality
[2:02] that the apostles preached
[2:04] and through it salvation was made
[2:07] known
[2:09] and and just some things to establish
[2:12] the original
[2:13] message of the apost apostles that they
[2:16] delivered
[2:17] that's the pure gospel
[2:20] that is the gospel that we have to
[2:21] return return to in every age
[2:25] that's the call to the ages come back to
[2:28] the original faith the message of the
[2:30] apostles
[2:31] salvation is found in
[2:34] the message of the apostles and we
[2:36] understand through the age
[2:38] they slowly drifted away
[2:40] and then they slowly
[2:42] brought a restoration until god sent
[2:44] malachi 4 through brother branham's
[2:46] ministry
[2:47] to gather all of that restoration
[2:49] together and give us the full
[2:51] gospel before us so
[2:55] salvation is not
[2:56] in the interpretation of the church
[2:59] our church's interpretation another
[3:01] church's interpretation the pope's
[3:03] interpretation the archbishop of
[3:05] canterbury
[3:08] the president of the united pentecostal
[3:10] church international
[3:14] etc etc
[3:16] it's that's not the authoritative
[3:18] message
[3:20] that god was trying to get across
[3:22] we are supposed to preach
[3:24] what paul preached paul preached said if
[3:26] anyone preaches any other gospel than
[3:28] what i've already preached to you even
[3:30] myself or an angel that comes down from
[3:32] heaven let him and me be accursed
[3:36] you can't deviate from what the apostle
[3:38] paul
[3:40] originally
[3:41] preached and so
[3:42] that's what god will hold us accountable
[3:44] to
[3:45] that's what god has always held
[3:47] people accountable to
[3:49] now don't take that wrong in each age
[3:52] there's a message and there's a portion
[3:53] of the word allotted to each age that's
[3:55] to be restored
[3:57] and yet when god is looking down he's
[3:59] seeing this is my original message how
[4:02] faithful are you being to this original
[4:04] message which is contained
[4:06] in the scriptures
[4:08] the church cannot develop
[4:11] its own doctrine over over a period of
[4:14] time
[4:15] the church cannot take its response to
[4:19] false doctrine
[4:21] and develop another doctrine to fight
[4:24] against false doctrine
[4:27] this is the danger that's happened over
[4:28] the over over history the church cannot
[4:31] take its doctrine and say
[4:34] this is what we believe
[4:36] period and we don't need any correction
[4:38] and stay away from us if you
[4:40] have any other idea
[4:42] we can't we can't approach it
[4:44] in that manner we as believers today
[4:48] still have to be corrected
[4:51] back to
[4:53] the original faith
[4:55] you say but i have it it's in the
[4:56] message
[4:58] that's true god vindicated that message
[5:00] it's been delivered to us and yet none
[5:03] of us have received it perfectly
[5:05] otherwise
[5:06] the rapture would have taken place we'd
[5:08] all be we've all already been in the
[5:09] unity of the faith
[5:11] so the picture is not hey we've arrived
[5:14] the picture is that we need to
[5:16] constantly
[5:17] be living lives of
[5:19] correction and repentance
[5:21] in our understanding there's a there's
[5:25] there's this um
[5:28] doctrine that comes out of the
[5:29] reformation
[5:31] i'm not going to use the latin
[5:32] terminology but it's basically that it
[5:35] means that the church must always be
[5:37] reformed
[5:39] if we're in the process where we're just
[5:41] settling down and we're comfortable
[5:43] here and someone come and and a
[5:46] correction comes from the holy spirit we
[5:48] say
[5:49] we don't you know we've been in the
[5:51] message for 40 years
[5:53] don't you know we see everything
[5:55] perfectly and we're just right i don't
[5:58] need anything more
[5:59] the holy spirit says okay you stay there
[6:02] i'm gonna come move on with other people
[6:04] that want to move on that's critical for
[6:07] every one of us
[6:09] we must always be
[6:11] conforming ourselves to
[6:13] the word
[6:14] otherwise if we're not conforming
[6:16] ourselves to the word we're slowly
[6:17] conforming to the world there's the
[6:20] devil always has a process
[6:22] god always has a process it depends on
[6:25] who's we're listening to
[6:26] what we're feeding on and what our
[6:28] attitude towards what we're listening
[6:30] to is
[6:34] so there is a core reality
[6:37] of the gospel and you read the book of
[6:39] acts
[6:41] it's not difficult to discern
[6:43] what is being preached what is being
[6:45] proclaimed
[6:46] and the people hearing it and receiving
[6:48] it
[6:50] could then experience salvation
[6:53] in their own life that's what the gospel
[6:55] came to do it means good news
[6:58] good news because we need we needed
[7:00] salvation right so that's that's the
[7:02] foundation we actually need to be saved
[7:06] that means we're broken
[7:08] it means that there's
[7:10] impending doom that's coming our way
[7:12] basically
[7:13] right when you're when you're
[7:15] if you're everything's fine and
[7:16] everything's going to continue to be
[7:18] fine you don't need any salvation
[7:21] but when there's a condemnation
[7:24] that you're under that's
[7:26] there needs to be a salvation
[7:29] and that's why god had to come
[7:31] and make himself in the form of human
[7:33] flesh
[7:34] and shed his blood
[7:36] so that we could experience
[7:38] that salvation it's a it's an experience
[7:42] with
[7:42] god and
[7:44] and
[7:46] through history
[7:48] we see this
[7:49] mistake made
[7:51] one
[7:52] by the formal churches
[7:54] it's that
[7:56] we need we need our confession and we
[7:58] need obedience to
[8:01] these certain things
[8:03] that they believe are scriptural so they
[8:06] they say
[8:07] we need obedience to these specific
[8:09] scriptural
[8:11] orders
[8:12] and if we don't we can't experience the
[8:15] promised salvation
[8:18] then you have the other side of the the
[8:20] coin which is the pentecostal realm
[8:22] which is
[8:24] i have my own personal relationship with
[8:27] christ
[8:28] okay
[8:30] what does that mean
[8:31] apart from the word
[8:34] there needs to be
[8:35] a revelation and understanding of the
[8:37] word
[8:39] and there needs to be
[8:41] a walk of obedience to that word and you
[8:44] can't say i have a personal relationship
[8:47] i have a personal experience with god
[8:50] and then deviate from the word so on the
[8:54] one hand
[8:55] obedience to the word is required
[8:57] on the other hand if you don't have an
[8:59] experience with god
[9:01] all your outward obedience is
[9:03] meaningless
[9:05] and so there's there's this
[9:07] there's this balance that needs to be
[9:09] had
[9:10] but the gospel
[9:12] is to do what
[9:14] what is the gospel
[9:16] paul describes what the gospel is in
[9:18] first corinthians 15
[9:19] he says it's the death burial
[9:23] resurrection and ascension
[9:26] of jesus christ
[9:28] i believe
[9:29] it in those facts of history
[9:32] fantastic
[9:33] they're facts of history i also believe
[9:36] alexander the great
[9:38] conquered many nations
[9:40] okay it's a fact of history
[9:42] that doesn't
[9:44] because i believe in alexander the great
[9:46] it doesn't do anything for me
[9:48] i believe in the fact
[9:50] that jesus died
[9:52] was buried
[9:54] raised raised from the dead
[9:56] is ascended
[9:57] at the right hand of god making
[9:59] intercession for us
[10:00] okay
[10:02] fantastic it's a good start but how does
[10:04] actually what that those historical
[10:07] facts
[10:08] those historical facts actually have to
[10:10] be applied
[10:11] to my life
[10:13] it's
[10:14] just because there is such a thing as
[10:16] salvation and i believe that it's a
[10:18] possibility doesn't mean i have
[10:21] experienced
[10:22] salvation in my life
[10:25] what did the gospel come to do
[10:28] ultimately what did it come to do
[10:30] it came to fix
[10:33] what adam and eve
[10:34] broke
[10:36] right
[10:37] so what what was broken fellowship with
[10:39] god
[10:40] and the image and likeness of god
[10:43] so christ came to
[10:45] restore fellowship
[10:47] and restore us
[10:49] to be the image and likeness of god
[10:52] that's what that's what the transforming
[10:54] power
[10:55] that comes the new creation
[10:57] in christ jesus that we become that's
[11:00] where it comes from is we're to be now
[11:03] expressing
[11:04] what man and woman were originally made
[11:08] to be which is a living
[11:11] expression of the invisible god
[11:14] and so this
[11:16] salvation
[11:18] that was
[11:19] basically you say this salvation was
[11:21] purchased
[11:22] by historical facts
[11:25] right it has to be then applied to our
[11:27] life how does that get applied to our
[11:29] life
[11:31] it's it's simple by the holy spirit
[11:35] and then over time we've got all these
[11:37] tremendous doctors how do we get the
[11:38] holy spirit well
[11:40] we have to be baptized sprinkled as an
[11:43] infant
[11:44] then we have to go through confirmation
[11:46] class
[11:47] and then we have to
[11:49] uh
[11:52] the list goes on and on we have to
[11:53] follow all the sacraments of the church
[11:56] we have to be in obedience and even then
[11:58] you don't really know if you're saved or
[12:00] not
[12:01] because then you have to go to the
[12:03] priest and make confession
[12:05] okay i'm a protestant you have to go up
[12:07] to the front of the church
[12:08] shake the preacher's hand make your
[12:11] confession
[12:12] get baptized write your name on the book
[12:14] go to new believer some churches they
[12:16] won't even let you get baptized until
[12:18] you go through a new believer's class
[12:20] for one year it's the same thing as a
[12:22] catechism class
[12:25] it's no different
[12:27] there was a
[12:28] there was a group that we were
[12:30] formerly working with in the middle east
[12:32] called themselves
[12:33] message believers and they said we don't
[12:35] want to baptize anyone until they've
[12:37] been through a new believer's class for
[12:38] one year
[12:40] said all right you can go ahead and have
[12:41] your catechism classes but we're going
[12:43] to follow the scriptures as many as
[12:45] believed were baptized
[12:49] so all of these things
[12:51] add to add to add to add to
[12:54] it's good to be taught it's good to be
[12:56] it's good to grow in your faith you have
[12:58] to you must if you have true faith you
[13:00] will grow in your faith but the reality
[13:03] is all of those things are replacing
[13:07] one thing
[13:09] and that's an experience
[13:11] by the holy ghost
[13:13] that changes this life that applies
[13:16] the death burial resurrection and
[13:19] ascension of jesus christ to us
[13:23] otherwise all you're believing is in
[13:25] vain
[13:27] we you have to apply
[13:29] brother branham talks about that in the
[13:31] token message
[13:32] you have to apply the token the life is
[13:36] in the blood right
[13:38] the life is in the blood they had to
[13:41] put that expression of life the blood
[13:44] on the doorposts in other words it had
[13:46] to be if it just stayed in the bucket
[13:49] it's a fact
[13:51] there's a historical fact that a blam
[13:53] was slain
[13:55] but god said apply it
[13:58] it has to be applied so then it's
[14:00] applied the death angel can pass by
[14:03] so for us
[14:05] it's not enough to just confess that you
[14:08] believe the message
[14:10] brother branham says that means you can
[14:11] read
[14:12] you must apply
[14:14] the token which is a personal experience
[14:17] say how do i know if i have it if you
[14:19] have it it produces the same life that
[14:21] jesus had it's so simple
[14:24] these things are just the core reality
[14:26] of the gospel
[14:28] and yet the church and sometimes the
[14:30] message leaves it all behind
[14:33] where we are so
[14:34] revelated that we miss the simplicity
[14:38] of our need you have to have the holy
[14:40] ghost
[14:42] for the blood to be applied
[14:44] listen closely for the blood to be
[14:47] applied you have to do what
[14:50] have the token what's the token the holy
[14:53] ghost
[14:54] so how are you going to get the
[14:56] application of the blood of jesus
[14:59] without the baptism of the holy ghost
[15:04] you're not it's not going to happen
[15:06] so do we need
[15:09] it
[15:11] this has been spoken about before but
[15:14] the we need the word
[15:17] in its fullness
[15:19] preached in our age
[15:21] to receive the holy ghost
[15:24] a false word is not going to produce
[15:28] holy ghost lives in the people that are
[15:30] listening amen
[15:32] it's not going to do it
[15:35] it's going to produce a false word
[15:37] produces a false
[15:39] life
[15:41] in luther's age they had a part of the
[15:42] word in wesley's age they had a part of
[15:44] the word we don't have an excuse now
[15:48] we have the full word
[15:50] vindicated right in front of us
[15:53] we can't say i'm just
[15:55] look at all those people out there in
[15:57] the world i'm better than they are
[15:59] therefore i have all i i have need of
[16:03] that's not how it works the spirit of
[16:05] truth guides you into all truth
[16:09] not a part of the truth not a little bit
[16:11] of the truth the holy spirit teaches us
[16:14] corrects us and conforms us
[16:17] to the word
[16:21] so
[16:23] jesus is that savior
[16:26] that healer he's the one
[16:28] that changes and transforms
[16:31] every heart that's what the holy spirit
[16:33] has come to do is your heart been
[16:35] changed
[16:38] do you have a desire to walk in
[16:40] obedience to the full word of god
[16:45] then
[16:46] the token's been applied
[16:48] it's not it's not a complicated thing
[16:50] you say i fall short in a lot of ways
[16:53] me too
[16:55] me too but i'm a work in progress i
[16:58] the spirit of god is working inside of
[17:00] me
[17:03] again
[17:06] a person be full of facts about
[17:09] the message
[17:11] that is not the same thing as having the
[17:13] token applied
[17:15] full of facts about
[17:17] this is the seven thunders
[17:19] this is godhead doctrine
[17:22] but what about your life
[17:24] that's what christ came to do
[17:26] not to give us knowledge
[17:28] he came to redeem us
[17:30] so that the lives that we have
[17:33] are expressing what
[17:35] what he made us to be in in the
[17:37] beginning
[17:38] in his image and his likeness to be the
[17:41] visible expression
[17:43] of the invisible spirit
[17:45] so we're walking you and i are walking
[17:47] around in life people are seeing god
[17:50] that's what we were made
[17:52] created in the beginning to be
[17:55] jesus died on the cross so that we would
[17:57] have that
[17:58] what do we have the message today what
[18:01] is the restoration of the message today
[18:03] so that we would be
[18:05] him manifested
[18:08] why were we restored to the full why did
[18:10] we even have to be restored to the full
[18:11] word couldn't we just have the blood of
[18:13] christ and have a part of the word
[18:16] there'd be no rapture that's for sure
[18:19] there needs to be a full word restored
[18:23] are you gonna are we gonna be a bride
[18:25] without spot or wrinkle
[18:27] with just
[18:29] one part of the word
[18:31] maybe we have seven sacraments and we
[18:33] believe in
[18:34] all kind of nonsense
[18:36] but hey we believe in jesus
[18:38] that's enough i got a relationship with
[18:40] jesus
[18:41] that's that that's doesn't mean anything
[18:44] that has no meaning
[18:46] without the life of jesus being inside
[18:48] of you
[18:50] judas had a relationship with jesus too
[18:53] it didn't mean he experienced salvation
[18:57] right
[19:00] caiaphas had a relationship with jesus
[19:02] too
[19:03] oh but i'm not talking about that
[19:05] okay what are you talking about then
[19:09] our jesus in you produces
[19:13] a life of what
[19:16] surrender to the word jesus said if you
[19:18] love me
[19:20] you'll do whatever you want to do
[19:22] and you'll disregard anything everything
[19:25] half of what i say
[19:28] that's what the denomination tells us
[19:31] that's what the system tells us
[19:34] we don't need the full word
[19:35] we're comfortable with where we're at
[19:38] the bride is not comfortable with where
[19:41] she's at until she's in full surrender
[19:45] to jesus christ if you love me
[19:48] keep my commandments and he says where i
[19:50] am there will my servant be also it
[19:54] doesn't say wherever my servant is
[19:55] that's where i am
[19:58] who's the one that's leading you or him
[20:03] my goodness i'm so far off my topic
[20:07] matthew 16 16-18
[20:12] peter
[20:15] had a supernatural revelation simon
[20:17] peter replied you're the christ
[20:19] the son of the living god and jesus
[20:22] answered him blessed are you simon
[20:23] barjona
[20:25] for flesh and blood has not revealed
[20:26] this to you but my father who is in
[20:28] heaven and i tell you
[20:30] you are peter
[20:31] and on this rock i will build my church
[20:34] and the gates of hell shall not
[20:37] prevail against it
[20:41] that's the revelation of who he is peter
[20:43] is not that rock
[20:45] peter means little stone
[20:47] jesus is not directly the rock rather
[20:51] it's the revelation of who
[20:53] jesus christ is
[20:56] that is the foundation that the church
[20:58] is built upon
[20:59] it's the foundation
[21:01] right
[21:03] it's not the continuation it's just the
[21:05] foundation
[21:06] this is where we start who is jesus
[21:09] who is jesus
[21:11] is jesus the one that's proclaimed on
[21:13] the denominational church
[21:18] oh yeah that's jesus
[21:20] it is
[21:21] jesus is who he
[21:23] says he is
[21:24] jesus is where he manifests himself
[21:28] so when jesus wants to
[21:32] be known
[21:33] he makes himself known
[21:35] we don't get to stand up and say hey
[21:37] this is what we this is what this is
[21:40] what jesus is that's theology
[21:43] jesus declare he's first he's declared
[21:45] himself in the word and then he's
[21:47] promised certain things in the word to
[21:49] be manifested in certain ages
[21:52] then who is jesus
[21:54] the mighty angel that came down with an
[21:57] open book to restore us back
[22:00] to the original faith
[22:02] jesus
[22:03] is not some historical figure that died
[22:06] 2000 years ago
[22:08] that people want to model their lives
[22:10] over because he was such a good man
[22:12] that's not who jesus is
[22:14] that's who he was
[22:17] but who is he
[22:19] it's who he declares himself to be
[22:22] who you know when moses
[22:25] was called of god he said who
[22:27] should i say
[22:28] sent him
[22:30] he didn't he didn't say well
[22:32] you know
[22:33] historical god he made reference to a
[22:35] historical god
[22:36] the god of abraham god of isaac the god
[22:39] of jacob but when he said who will i say
[22:41] sent him he didn't say tell him the god
[22:43] of jacob sent you
[22:45] he said i am that i am
[22:48] tell them i am sent you the god who
[22:51] declares himself that's
[22:54] another way you could translate i am
[22:56] that i am is i become what i become
[22:59] in other words
[23:00] i manifest myself
[23:02] in front of you that's
[23:04] who who is this the one that's been
[23:06] manifested that's the importance of this
[23:10] message
[23:11] let's not get away from that
[23:13] what is it what is this all about
[23:17] we have a relationship with jesus what
[23:19] jesus
[23:21] there's another jesus
[23:23] which is not jesus
[23:24] who is jesus he's the one
[23:27] who manifests himself he's the i am not
[23:30] the i was
[23:32] not the i will be
[23:34] the one who's declared himself
[23:36] in this day through a prophet
[23:39] this is who jesus is
[23:41] the whole world is grasping after
[23:44] something else
[23:45] something different
[23:47] another idea
[23:48] another theology
[23:50] a new book that some superstar
[23:53] quote unquote christian
[23:55] theologian puts out
[23:57] no
[23:59] no
[24:00] he is the word
[24:03] and he declares himself the same
[24:04] yesterday
[24:06] today and forever he did that through
[24:08] the prophet so that we would understand
[24:10] what is he doing in this hour
[24:12] he is perfecting a bride
[24:16] jesus is not calling
[24:19] in denominations
[24:21] you see denominations they have meetings
[24:23] they have things happen people are
[24:25] coming to the altar
[24:27] they're not experiencing jesus
[24:30] say who are you
[24:31] who do you think you are
[24:33] up there telling us who jesus is and who
[24:36] jesus isn't
[24:37] the prophet taught us
[24:39] the truth
[24:42] has nothing to do with my idea
[24:44] we just need to get rid of this
[24:47] false concept
[24:48] that there's a thousand jesuses
[24:51] and whichever way i live it's fine
[24:53] just as long as i stamp the name of
[24:55] jesus on top of it
[24:57] that's not right
[24:59] it's not scriptural
[25:01] jesus produces a life that's in
[25:04] conformity to the word
[25:07] not in conformity to our thoughts not in
[25:10] conformity to the world
[25:13] to the word
[25:15] that's the jesus that we worship
[25:18] that we're serving
[25:20] people say well that's not my jesus okay
[25:24] you have your own jesus
[25:27] you make up your own jesus but it's an
[25:28] idol
[25:30] jesus has been manifested today
[25:34] we don't get to make up what we like we
[25:35] don't get to make up the doctrines we
[25:37] don't get to say oh we like this one and
[25:40] like that one and this one's okay and
[25:41] that one's okay
[25:43] go ahead
[25:44] go ahead you're doing exactly what they
[25:46] did when the white horse rider was
[25:48] writing
[25:50] don't listen to the voice of the white
[25:52] horse rider
[25:53] there's a word that's been vindicated
[25:55] and manifested
[25:56] we have to take it back to the bible
[26:00] we have to use spiritual discernment
[26:03] to understand what's thus saith the lord
[26:06] but when brother brandon preaches
[26:07] something for 20 years it's not our job
[26:11] to redefine it to change it
[26:13] to say oh that's wrong
[26:15] no
[26:16] god vindicated that word
[26:19] and he expects disa
[26:22] he says
[26:23] i want you to obey that word when the
[26:25] prophet deuteronomy 18 when a prophet
[26:28] comes
[26:31] preaches that preaches his brings his
[26:32] message
[26:33] he says those who don't listen i will
[26:36] require it of them in other words
[26:38] they're going to answer to god at the
[26:40] day of judgment
[26:41] for turning down and rejecting
[26:44] the manifested word
[26:47] amen let's let's stand and pray
[26:53] heavenly father i thank you so much for
[26:55] your word
[26:57] lord help us to
[27:00] not conform you to our thinking lord but
[27:03] to
[27:04] be conformed to what's been
[27:06] proven and vindicated
[27:09] help us lord
[27:10] forgive us our
[27:12] sins forgive us our unbelief
[27:15] lord cleanse our hearts father correct
[27:18] us
[27:19] and help us lord to walk more
[27:22] lord in that image and likeness which he
[27:24] created us to be
[27:26] we ask your blessing upon the worship
[27:28] upon the preaching of the word may your
[27:30] name be lifted up and glorified we ask
[27:33] these things in the name of our lord
