spirit [Music] you love him this morning and god bless you we'll go straight to the word romans chapter 7 thank you for all that worship amen romans chapter 7 we just like to carry on from where we were last time we spoke on this thought i sent a powerpoint if you have that you could just have it ready romans chapter 7. amen appreciated all that singing and those specials amen that worship amen that we had brother matthew uh sang a song this morning that i just i can't tell you how much it meant to me personally knowing what direction i would go and what i'm preaching on just was the mind of the lord so appreciate that and um don't you just love him amen is any good to us i want to pray for the ministry that's away i think we got every preacher except matthew me matthew and caleb all the rest of them are gone uh my dad's away brother brad's away brother jd's away and so just pray for their services this morning i know brother jason's in a different time zone but the brad was ministering even earlier uh this morning he sent a prayer request for him so but we're here and the lord jesus is everywhere you believe that he's everywhere amen all the time romans chapter 7 we just like to minister to you this morning on continuing on being changed i'm going to go to my first powerpoint first that i sent uh wednesday that when i spoke let's just begin reading here and i just want to take just a text from uh this is something that is very familiar we've read it but i want you not just to read this uh because you've read it many times sometimes you have a sense to gloss over it and hear it again we're just reading it because it's tradition to read the scripture before you preach well let's not do that this morning i want you to really key in on what romans 7 is saying here and then we'll we'll take a a text from it let's look at it again here in verse 13 verse 14 we'll begin for we know that the law is spiritual but i am carnal sold under sin for that which i do i allow not for what i would that do i not but what i hate that do i if then i do that which i would not i can send to the law that it is good now then it is no more i that do it but sin that dwelleth in me for i know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing so presently the apostle paul could say that is in my flesh so he makes a distinction between something if he's if he's pointing out to clarify what he's speaking of when he says in me there's no good thing when you say in me you mean body soul and spirit because you're made up of more than your personality more than your makeup more than how you look and how you draw how you present yourself there's more to you than what i see you here this morning there's more to you let me say it this way there's more to you than what you see in the mirror and so brother branham says you're a triune being you're made up of body soul and spirit so the apostle paul is speaking of that triune being and he's going to clarify now this to me it just makes it that much more clear that romans 7 is not as we said last wednesday it's not as some would suggest that this is the condition of the unconverted but no this is actually the condition of the converted believer until their body's changed because he says here that is he says for i know that in me that is in my flesh in other words i'm not talking about the soul that's been converted and changed and translated but this rotten flesh that gives me so much trouble he says i know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing amen for to will is present with me aha you see before you're born again there is no will to do right you may you may uh reform yourself under you have good parents and you so you want to have good morals the apostle paul here say he's saying here for in me there's no good thing in my flesh for to will so there's something beyond the flesh something that's in the soul that's willing to do the right thing wanting and desiring to live the right life the will is present within me but how to perform that which is good i find not for the good that i would he says here in verse 19 for the good that i would i do not but the evil which i would not that i do now if i do that i would not in other words if i'm doing what i know in my inner man i shouldn't be doing he says if i do that i would not it is no more i that do it but sin that dwelleth in me i find then a law it's almost like the apostle's figuring this out as he's speaking i find then a law that when i would do good evil's present with me for i delight in the law of god after the flesh y'all that are still not not focused here you're saying amen to come on get with me for i delight in the law of god after the flesh after my intellect no for i want to i delight in the things of god after the inward man but i see another law in my members warring against the law of my mind friends you should take comfort if there's a war taking place if there is no war and no battle you're in trouble he says i find then a law he says be but all my members warring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members lord we thank you for the reading of your word this morning we're just going to pause right there lord already knowing that you're in control lord knowing that you have all things already lord designed you have them laid out you have them thought out lord and it's right now father that we just ask you and invite you to come and take your word lord and come and break into the hearts of your children to me the speaker lord to them the hearer to those that will listen lord we just humble ourself to you right now asking lord for your divine help to be with us lord in this sunday morning service in jesus name amen you can be seated let's pull up that first powerpoint if you could the first one that i sent not that one one i had sent last last wednesday should be called being changed one you'll find it being changed one paul says here in verse 24 let's just continue while they're pulling that up o wretched man that i am who shall deliver me from the body of this death and then he says that famous line i thank god through jesus christ our lord so that when we he says so then with the mind i myself serve the law of god but with the flesh the law of sin now he's not speaking of his mind intellectually here but he's speaking of a law of the inward man so the apostle paul speaking here and i just want to you can just have that ready for me he he speaks of this this struggle this this war that is constantly taking place we spoke a lot in last time on being changed i'm just going to recap some of that here this morning but he's speaking here of this struggle this war that is taking place to the believer and and he's asking this question uh i i i know that i'm gonna i know that there's a desire in me and i believe we could just quickly bring ourselves to paul's uh state of being i think all of us here as believers could right away at the very beginning of this sermon could say i can identify with the apostle paul that i want to do what is right i want to live a life that is uh according to the word of god i want to live a life that's pleasing to the lord but oh if i can just figure out this struggle inside of me i i know that i love the lord i know i've came to the lord jesus i know he's changed my life i know i've had an experience with the lord in so much that i can say i'm not the same person that i was now be very careful because intellectually you can be changed and get a new heart you can get a you can be justified you can be sanctified but not filled with the baptism of the holy ghost and so the real change that takes place in a person is not something that i can do not something you can do by iron will it's not something that you can do intellectually but brother burnham said that the baptism of the holy ghost that can change a person to be someone that they weren't is nothing short of a paradox now remember what a paradox is it's something that cannot be yet it is right something that come on i don't have my pre i don't have all the ministry here so y'all really gotta fill in their shoes this morning uh i got i got i need a good amen corner to stay right with me i got a lot a lot i want to get to and i believe it's from the lord but you've got paul is saying here there's brother branham says there's a change that takes place and he says it's a paradox it's it's something that cannot be yet it is it's a supernatural event the body the the the body change that changes you will be a supernatural unexplainable event that you can't perform and you can't do but god in the moment in the twinkling of an eye this mortal flesh will change so the same supernatural power that changes the flesh has to be the same power that changes your soul in other words if you in other words this is something that that you can't be taught it's not something that sitting in a church gives you amen we've heard it said years ago by my dad and i mean he maybe have gotten it from someone but he said sitting in church doesn't make you a christian any more than sitting in a garage makes you a car amen right you're you're either you're either a car or you're a person it's one of the other so there's a supernatural change that has to take place brothers sisters i can't preach on anything more simple yet more vital and important to you i want to challenge us this morning because i believe it's it's high it's a good time i believe it's high time that we challenge ourselves the bible says it this way to make our calling and our election sure there was ever a day in age that we've lived in that we should be making our calling and election shore every day of our life it's right now to work out our own salvation with fear and trembling it's what the scripture says to work out our own salvation with fear and trembling to make our colon and election sure so you say how can i get past this problem well you can look at the where did sin come from and how did i become infected with this law of sin that lives within me that constantly as a carnal nature that wants to do wrong and and has a has a is bent towards the wild it's bent towards the wrong things you don't come into this life seeking after the right things you actually come into this life tasting and thirsting and hungering for the wrong things amen because there's a law that lives down inside of you of sin so you say where where could i where could i get to where could we trace it back to you can trace it all the way back to the origin of of the fall in the garden of eden and we could look at that and we could we could look at that and teach on the beginning and how we you know what took place in the garden how adam fell and how eve fell but let me just move beyond that because i think a much more important question we can ask ourselves is is not how did it begin but how did i become infected with this problem because before you can ever be fixed or delivered there first must be recognition and it admits that i've got the disease and it's my own struggle as paul said it's my own personal battle it's my own personal problem a person who's infected uh is diagnosed with cancer they that you could sit them down and tell them how cancer begins and and look at scientifically what a cancer is and and and and how you get cancer and you could tell them you're under a microscope well this is what happens when a molecule and you got these kind of cells in your body but listen you you might be able to tell that to me and get my attention you you start to tell that to a person who has cancer and there's no interest in where cancer came from the interest is how do i become cured of my cancer and so when you recognize yourself that sin is not just sin most people live their lives studying and thinking oh here's sin and i know there's evil and i know there's good and and we can study the origin of that but friends how about we admitted ourselves to where we can look just like a person who has cancer and can have a death sentence on them when you get that kind of recognition then there's a there's a desire and there's a plea to say lord i don't just it doesn't matter how it begin i just want to be free i want to be delivered of it the bible says this and i'm just going to go through some of these scriptures quickly so you don't have to turn romans 3 verse 9. oh men oh everybody somebody say all together all men are every man alike both jew and gentile all are sinners that means everybody both jew both gentile everybody so uh is there anybody better than anybody else nope nobody's better than anybody else maybe by history or background or who you were nope nobody's better than anybody else there's no little sin and no big sin in the eyes of god i know that's something we can we can almost trivialize but i i want to emphasize it this morning there's no big sin and no little sin brother madam said that there's one sin and that's the sin of unbelief there is however a difference between a person who's unconverted and who lives under the dominion and the power of sin and a person who has been set free from the dominion of sin but is still influenced by sin amen i want to tell you something so powerful and so amazing that brother steve curtis sent me after i preached this last uh wednesday and i preached on being changed it was so powerful you know the picture that they have and i'm sure many of you have seen it you maybe could pull it up gideon if you pull up if you just google search uh brother branham and the pillar of fire the indian chief and you go to google images you're gonna find a picture there of the prophet preaching if he gets it good if not i'll just continue on if you type in brother branham and indian chief you should see a picture of brother branham like this and then a a a form behind him it's amazing brother steve had texted me this picture and he begins to because i was preaching on and i don't have time to cover it and background it again but i was preaching on brother brandon i'm talking about the the the cocker borough and he talks about the life that that dies in that cockroach he says but no matter how much you're converted remember this i preached it wednesday he said no matter how much you're converted you'll always live with that sticky nature that's inside of you that flesh that'll always trip you up that old nature and brother branham then gives a story about the chief who came up for healing me sick and and then brother branham hears his converted one day and he begins to talk to her this man begins to talk to him and he says chief and he talks about the white dog and the black dog and he says chief which one wins he says well it all depends on which dog chief feeds the most if i feed this dog the most he's going to win the fight if i feed this dog the most uh he's going to win the fight and remember i'd spoke on that you remember that from wednesday and brother branham's talking about the old nature that old sticky nature that's always within you do you have that gideon you could you could that's fine no worries you how many raised your hand if you remember that picture of brother branham there and he's preaching and he's and he's and he's got a almost looks like the uh a a a an image of streaks of something of light that are going past him like this there's some flowers in the front they're just bringing giving getting your mind to remembrance um and and so brother brandon begins to talk talk about that picture and brother steve had pointed out he told me a message and sent me just a little clip that that uh that brother lonnie jenkins had spoke on years ago and i had never seen it before it was it was so it would never heard it before it was so powerful but brother lina begins to talk about that picture and and he begins to tell i think it was brother sidney jackson i think was the brother if i'm remembering it correctly that that brother uh brother uh branham uh bro sorry brother sydney was talking to brother lonnie brother sydney said you know something amazing about he says something amazing about that picture and he says you notice there this is brother branham talking to brother sidney jackson and he says brother sidney i want you to look at that picture really closely and he says i want you to see something here and he says you see there those streaks of light that are going behind me and brother sydney says yes he says can you can you look and see says it looks like an old indian chief and if you look at that picture and you ever see that for yourself it's very clear you could throw it up gideon that's fine if you ever look you look here and it's very clear to see that that the the picture of an old indian chief almost like it's above brother branham maybe just two or three feet behind him looking down and brother branham tells brother sidney he says you see that right there any he yeah you can you can mute that good perfect thank you thank the lord we got that so you see this image here and i'm just going to point here it's going to mess the camera but that's fine this would be the chin right here this would be the nose you're looking at a profile of a of an indian chief looking just like this you see the chin is here the nose is here the eye socket would be here the head is here then you have almost like an indian wears a little signet in their hair up here and you have these waves that are going like this like feathers from his cap here's his shoulders his neck is right here if you've if you can't see that then then uh we could i could show you after church up close you could see it a lot better and and you almost see that as a picture looking and brother branham takes this picture to brother sydney and he shows him this and he says now brother sydney i want you to notice that indian chief that is right there and he says can you see that and brother brother sydney says yes brother branham i can see it he says you see brother sidney that's my old nature and he says because my mama was an indian and he says that's my old nature there always there to haunt me amen and he says brother brother branham says now it's in brother sydney says now it's important for me to tell you how brother branham used his hands and brother brandon begins to use his hands and he says you see brother sidney he says when the holy ghost when a person accepts he says when a person accepts the truth of the word and they repent of all their sins and they come to under the knowledge of the of the truth of the end time brother branham says in a person's really born of the spirit of god he says the fire of god comes into he says the fire of god comes into the soul and it burns out that old nature that's living here and he says and it pushes it out and brother takes his hands like this and he says see it's lost its position of dominion and it's moved to a position of influence you see i'm going to take that just for a moment to show you that before you're born of the spirit of god by the baptism of the holy ghost and i don't know why the lord just would just have to help me this morning i just want to emphasize this and if i sound like a broken record then i'm going to sound like a broken record the baptism of the holy ghost is not an intellectual thing that you accept by me preaching and you saying i believe that the baptism of the holy ghost is not you just pray in a prayer of repentance the baptism of the holy ghost is not you just saying i want the lord in my heart and so the lord's in my heart the lord may not be in your heart say brother matt then how do i get it very simple repent and true repentance is not a prayer true repentance is when you turn around and you change and go the other way you forsake something you come out of something you sanctify yourself and god then not you not a preacher not a prayer not an anointing oil not speaking in tongues god himself tabernacles and enters that old nature comes out and a new nature comes in and so young people listen to me close if that's never happened you're not born again of the spirit of god amen very clear you might sit in church you might be raised by good parents they may believe the message but let me just say it to you make your call in an election sure seek out your own salvation with fear and trouble say brother matt does that take then it must take justification sanctification baptisms must be months down the road well it could be for some people some people have been sitting in sanctification for years and never born of the spirit of god and that's why they're constantly entangled in bondages of sin and they never change others repent and in one instant god sees the level of repentance and fills them with the baptism of the holy ghost the house of cornelius as the word was being preached they were filled with the holy ghost so the problem is is we make measuring lines and brother branham says away with experiences for a measuring life it all comes down to your repentance so brother branham says that old nature's driven out and he says now it moves to a position of influence so if you're sitting here without the baptism of the holy ghost this morning you're the the difference between a person who's filled with the spirit of the person who isn't is very simple the person who isn't has sin is dominating and is on the throne of their heart but a person who's been born again there's no the dominion there's a new king sitting on the throne and there's a war that's taking place because that old nature's influencing them are we clear this morning so he says he moves from a spot of dominion to a position of influence pull up that power point if you could the first one that we told you to get get him thank you so he says none are good no not god no no he says no not none are good except the lord even nicodemus said that when he says a good master and jesus says there's none good but god there's none good but god uh he and and so so we we set that we set that straight romans 3 verse 10 i'm going to read it from a different translation of you could put up the new living bible he says no one is good romans 3 10 no one is good no one in all the world is innocent no one has ever really followed god's paths or even truly wanted to everyone has turned away all have gone wrong no one anywhere has kept on doing what is right no one amen amen sorry i just took your angel wings away and your halos laying over there crunched and crashed in the yard let me tell you as i heard a man say it was so powerful even some of you who maybe have listened to jordan peterson and recently was converted and and as a professing believer now and he begins to he made a powerful statement he said really when we really think about it the only true christian was jesus the only true christian only one who's really a christian was jesus christ himself amen the bible doesn't mince words and it doesn't it doesn't sugarcoat the condition of the carnal nature of this of sin that reigns within us and romans 3 13 says their talk is foul and filthy like the stench from an open grave their tongues are loaded with lies this is sin dwelling in your in your in your in your body he says everything they say has it has in it the sting and poison of deadly snakes their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness they are quick to shed blood haste hating anyone who disagrees with them wherever they go they leave misery and trouble behind them and they have never known what it is to feel secure or enjoy god's blessing they care about nothing about god or what he thinks of them so it's very important how you look at sin it's very important your approach to how you look at your first birth can i say it that way because that's what i'm really talking about here this morning it's very important how you look at your first birth and you look at it properly and scripturally and and so these you say brother matt why is that important because the only way that you'll ever get god to forgive there's no way you can ever understand as we've said here many times before you'll never understand the mercy of god until you first understand the wrath of god until you get a revelation of how lost you are you'll never know what kind of freedom you need and so he says here and and and and so the bible says this about the heart jeremiah 17 9 the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked amen who can know it that's right well i feel in my heart that i feel in my heart how many times have we said that the heart is deceitfully wicked above all who can know it not you not me amen let me say it this way it's very rare that sin and uh presents itself in its true nature never presents itself in its true colors it never comes to you and says oh come here give me a big hug i'm going to infest you with every kind of pollution and disease i'm going to i'm going to ruin you i'm gonna just just take just a little sip i'm gonna it's gonna destroy you know it never advertises that as we said about the man who's smoking a cigarette he's up there cowboy young and healthy and he's got if they never show you the picture of that man with a lung cancer laying on his deathbed in a hospital surrounded by a family satan never comes to you in his true colors pride bitterness envy jealousies sin he never says i'm your i'm your enemy i'm going to destroy you so just take a little piece of me no no he's very very much more sin sin comes to you like a angelic uh with wings and holy and justifies it in every possible way you get a temper and you say the wrong thing and then you'd always just my righteous indignation it'll it'll cloak itself it'll hide itself it'll cloak itself it'll cloak itself to believers now remember this isn't to the unconverted because brother adam says the difference is is that they are just sin this the christian is the only one who can really sin the unbeliever is just an unbeliever and that's what he is he lives by the law is dominated by that amen but a believer can be influenced by the wrong thing by their flesh and sin we've got to get somewhere so i got to hurry this morning so he doesn't come around and say it he comes very with an outstretched arm and flattering words and it seems so harmless it's cloaked under so many smooth names and and so innocent and well it's not really that big of a deal and it just sort of reshapes and re-masks itself but you know what you know what you know what you can't change you could you could change its name you could call it whatever you want you could justify it what you can't change is its character and what it produces in your life let's just move on we got we got to get to something so i just want to go to go to that first go to that first my goodness i told myself i wasn't gonna do this and i did it i didn't get to hardly my notes when i preached it wednesday and i thought i got sunday we'll get to it we're not going to so listen to what brother branham says here i want you just to follow i know this is a repeat but i want you to listen he says if you went into a doctor's office and told him you were sick i'm going to turn this on i guess so i can control it he says and told him you were sick and your symptoms and he was in a hurry he would probably give you a little prescription with some anesthetic on it some sort of aspirin he says the doctor he says the doctor is merely trying to get rid of you just at that time he just gives you a pill doesn't diagnose you doesn't look at it it says he's merely trying to get rid of you just at that time because he hasn't time but a real good doctor before he gives you the medicine would diagnose that case thoroughly until he found out what was wrong then give you the medicine it's very sometimes we make the gospel prescription we just throw it out there you just need to be born again you just need to get the holy ghost brother branham says when the doctor just throws that out there and you all just need to come up here and pray for you and if you shake and tremble and you all fall to the ground that's just what you need you just need to get in the holy ghost get the get in the prayer of mine that's all you need just get the holy ghost well that's true that's the pill that's what they need but brother man says a true doctor would thoroughly diagnose the case till he found out was what was wrong then give you the medicine and sometimes we find people through the prayer line coming across across the nations they just run up and think the lord ought to heal them right then but there's something maybe down in there and we set before the lord until he reveals that what that is there is something that brother madam says something so profound here he says there's a reason for everything now i want you to key that statement and i want you to have it in your mind throughout the rest of this sermon that statement there's a reason for everything amen he says there's a reason for everything and you've got to find the reason first and then you could find what to work on and he says here he says not some program excuse me interviews this morning he says let me just move down the person is genuine person real person let viv dry they've heard me say the evidence of the holy ghost was speaking in tongues and it isn't now this is this is let me let me just move from this this is the example we gave wednesday of brother branham seeing the nature that was in this person and seeing what sign they were born under he says that here which way uh it was set their natural nature sets them in a certain line so your first old nature remember brother branham says that's my old nature always there to haunt me so that first nature sets them in a certain line it develops how you think even after you're converted it trips you up and bothers you in ways that it might not bother me but i have things in my nature that may not trip you up but may trip me up and both of us be born of the spirit of god and both of us questioning if we've been born again hello that nature that old nature says brother and says i've seen she was a certain sign she was born under and he says i just told her just preach that the speaking in tongues is not the evidence of the holy ghost but actually for this person i prayed and said i advise you to pray and ask the lord so that you'll speak in tongues why would brother branham do that because he understood the nature that this person the sign they were born under and he understood that until that happened that person would always question that in their life you see there's a lot that has to do with our makeup of our of how we were born how we were raised the atmosphere of our home the atmosphere of our school the teachers that we had remember brother madam says that's you don't realize how important your mother is and he said because the first love a child ever receives is the true genuine love of a mother that's why it's so important for a mother to love their children biblically according to the way the lord has instructed us and trained us to train up a child because that mother's there to fill that void that's inside that child's heart and if the mother doesn't feel that void brother branham says then that boy or that girl will grow up and take some violent substitute and so that mother's there and he gives that child that love he's feeling just the just the love and cherishment and nourishment and forgiveness and that's his first experience there's first no understanding of true godly love translated down through a mother to that child brother branham says but then shortly after that you move from your mother and then you go to your father and he says now you're under the tutelage no longer of mama mama says hey he's too big for me to spank you got to take over now he's six foot two and married with three kids no the mother says you gotta take over it's brother branham says it's it's the way god ordained it now he moves from the mother mother's love is always still there but now he moves under the father you see it's so important for that father than to know his role accept his role as tutor and as teacher and to show that brother branham says the show the love it's not that the love is not that the love is not love but he says it's a different type of love maybe a more corrective love remember brother diggs talked about that he said in every house there's law and grace and he said sometimes the mom's grace and the dad is law and brother dick says in my and my my house my mama was a police officer she she was the law and and so so there's always brother branham says then it moves from there to your father and you're trained that's why it's so important then when the passing off of when that when that transition happens in that child's life it's so important for the father to be who he should be seeing himself properly not addicted and not messed up he'll never a carnal uh nature can never help another carnal nature amen amen unsaved the blind can't the jesus said the blind will lead the blind and they'll all fall into the ditch doesn't mean that father's perfect but it's important that there's a father who's present and brother ben says and if he's not what happens he goes from that mother and all the love of that mother but never receives it from a father and he says then he goes into the world and he accepts some violent substitute to take the place of a godly father who should have been there amen amen that's why you hear brother brandon preaching so much on it's not child delinquency it's missing in action and and and we're all guilty hello fathers we're all mothers we're all guilty in some way shape or form amen none of us none of us is exempt so then he moves brother and says then you move from there from your father maybe it's your first teacher in school and he says and that teacher is going to serve an important role because that teacher now is training you and teaching you and they're they serve an important role in that child's life then from there maybe to a boss maybe their first job and brother branham says it's this way leadership he preaches that in leadership it's leading them should be leading them to the baptism of the holy ghost who is the real teacher and the real tutor that they need and he says but if not they'll accept some violent substitute to take the place of that so he said brother matt why did you point all that out by the mother then the father then the teacher then the employer then because it's important to understand that you who you are and i'm going to say this statement who you are as an adult is a lot of times a reaction of a childhood that you had remember brother branham talks about blowed up christians and he uses the example of a boiler and he says that he says you take that boiler and after it builds up pressure and more pressure and more pressure and he says finally if it has no way to let off the pressure he says it just blows up and goes through the roof amen and he says what is it he says that's why we he says that he said because the flu was clogged up it had no way to exhaust it had no way to vent and he says that's what's wrong with so many blowed up christians amen blown up christians and they blow up and a marriage is disintegrated and relationships are disintegrated and their testimony is disintegrated brother adam says the reason we've got so many blowed up christians is because of a clogged flu or a clogged pipe and he says they never cleaned out the channels memory conscience reasoning imagination affection you're more than just your flesh you're more than who you see in the mirror and let me repeat it there's a reason for everything amen i hope you're paying attention this morning there's a reason for everything they never clean out the channels so they get they're a blown-up christian they've got he says they never clean out the channels where does what is some of those clogs brother matt give me some clogs that clog things up a grudge will clog up your pipes bitterness will clog up your pipes unforgiveness and not willing to say not able to say i'm sorry will clog up your pipes there's a reason for everything i don't know why i struggle with this and now i'm battling this and brother matt i i've been born of the spirit of god there's a reason for everything it's just like i was speaking to brother charles here we were having this conversation after the men's breakfast and it was wonderful brother charles i wrote so many notes for this sermon today just from their conversation it's just like you take a child and that child who doesn't receive because i said every everything in your adult life is just a reaction of your childhood so you take a child a a little girl who never receives affection and love and she and she she never receives uh proper uh uh uh uh uh uh cherishing and nourishment from a family then what happens there's a void created in that little girl and she grows up with that void and then she gets older and then then years pile over top of years the pain and the bruise is still there the herd is still there and then she goes later in marriage and she has children herself and you ever heard the statement it's very popular i'm sure you have that hurt people hurt people hurt people hurt people and so you take that same pain and now that's translated and transcended into a new relationship only most of the time it's worse a child who's raised under militant family and a militant dad and it's always a pressure to perform and everything's like a drill sergeant you've gotta you always feel like you gotta perform that your worth or your value is measured in how well you perform and if you drill that into a child so much that their worth and their value is how well they do then guess what happens when they get older they're performing their entire life they're trying they got a pressure to perform and then they pass that down to a wife and to sons and two daughters and then pain is just trans transcended into pain are you here this morning remember there's a reason for everything and you take you take that person maybe you grew up without a dad and a dad was an alcoholic and never was there never was home and then they'd grown up with that void of what it is to know a father then what happens that void is never filled and so when you go to preach to that person about a kind loving heavenly father they almost don't know how to receive that they know a militant angry upset god who's ready to strike them down and they live under that condemnation and pressure that's not from the lord it's from a bruise in their past because remember brother adam gives that gives that example of the tree the wheat plant and he says he says the wheat plants that he sees all the wheats in the field are growing straight up and got their head i think it was wheat maybe it wasn't but he says they they grow up straight he says but then i noticed a little one he says it was it was crooked he said it went like this and then it bent around this way and it came up this way then it sort of stuck its arm out like this it looked so deformed now it was alive he says now what happened he says maybe when it was just little he says a branch came down and fell over top of it and he says and and it deformed its life now let's here's the miracle it didn't die it's still alive and and brother branham says brother branham says something maybe it didn't do anything it didn't didn't do anything to deserve that didn't do anything wrong but just out of circumstances and atmospheres and families and conditions and places and you'd go through things and you didn't do anything wrong the miracle is that they survived though deformed amen and and and and so remember there's a reason for everything i'm going to keep saying that amen it's incredible second corinthians 12 14 it talks about a a a and i'm just going to go through some of this here it talks about he says behold the third time you don't need to put it up he says the third time i am ready to come to you and i will not be burdensome to you for i seek not yours but for you for the children for the children for the children ought not to lay up for the parents but the parents for the children amen now brother matt i provide i know what you're thinking i the children ought not to provide for the parents but the parents provide for the children yes we know that that's why our children we don't believe in child labor and he's not at work providing listen it's what it's much more than you putting a roof over their head it's much more than us putting a roof over their head or supplying them with correct training on how to get a job and how to be a responsible person there's much more to your biblical responsibility as a christian parent than training them how to be a good citizen in the world but the children ought not provide for the parent but the parents ought to train up a child in the way they should go y'all are quiet but i'm just going to keep plowing through so there's a reason he says you've got to clean out the channels purge your spirit you say brother matt what what should we do you should be purging your spirit every day of your life you should be saying lord today is a new day wash my mind wash my memory wash my conscience wash my imagination wash my affection wash me again lord let me clean out the channel so that i don't become a blowed up christian that's why brother branham even speaks about and we read it last time and it's in this powerpoint but i won't go to it you can pull up the next one brother adam talks about how that he had developed a complex and he says and he says i was calling them rickies and mercedes and he and his attitude he would come to the pulpit though a prophet of god though born again of the spirit he says but my attitude towards people was wrong and he says and the lord showed me you ought and you shouldn't do that he said those are those people are he says they would serve the lord if they knew what who to serve you remember that and brother branham says i got a complex he says maybe because he says i i wasn't a i wasn't made to kiss the babies and he says i wasn't that kind of a pastor to uh he says but but he says but my job was to hold the sword of the word and he says and cut the the head of the devil off and he said so i was in war i was in battle all the time and because of that i got a lot of scars i've been cut deep many times so brother brandon relates his attitude to people to a complex through pain and hurt that had been caused by other christians he says the reason i had the wrong attitude was because of if pain that i received i passed that pain off to people you say well you know br everybody can be guilty i mean we all got to repent of our attitude sometimes let me tell you what brother branham thought of that he didn't minor on it he didn't just say it's just not a big deal you know i mean i had the wrong attitude so i'm just going to go and repent i'm going to go pray and it'll all be okay brother branham says no he says i'm leaving the field he says i'm leaving the field you pray for me hold on brother brandon hol wait hold on a minute it's not that big of a deal brother brandon it's just your attitude just stop calling them ricky's and mercedes and it's just your attitude you repented you made it right brother branham says no i'm leaving the field i'm not going to preach he said it'd be better for me not to come to the pulpit until my heart is right and i can love those people and care for them again he says i ought not to preach until my spirit is right i've lost my love for people i want you to notice here what brother branham says and this is just so powerful i gotta i don't want to miss it he says now a cancer that's second greatest enemy the world has heart troubles first then cancer and tubercular according to the insurance companies now the cancer would be called in the natural a scavenger or a buzzard something that eats dead things this is a cancer brother is beginning to talk about this he says this is what a cancer is it's like a scavenger or a buzzard it's something that eats dead things a cancer usually comes from a bruise a bruise it strikes and the cells break and in other words this is the cells in other words they backslide and then their sets up say it with me so he's beginning to talk about cancer and he says it sets up another life it's about it's a bruise it says it starts with the bruise starts with something he says then those cells backslide and then their sets up now it didn't say it's another life yet but the stage has been set the betting ground is perfect amen it's ready to breed and make life so you say brother matt why are we shifting and turning this i want you to notice something here because this is how brother branham talks about a cancer it's amazing brother travis has a very close friend of his who he associate pastor of was us he was or he still i guess was uh of the of the seaside vineyard church who travis the church had came to before he came to our church and you know his testimony and this man was a very influential man and his life marcus and was a wonderful wonderful brother and just loves the lord and had and was just a strong firm uh uh individual strong leader just a powerful person and served a great role of influence in brother travis's life and and this this man 68 years old and strong and straight you know tall guy and and and and i just seen him had just met him at a basketball gideon's basketball game maybe just a few months ago and and now travis coles and this man has just been diagnosed had a lump that started growing on the side of his neck started just like the size of a golf ball that was became the size of like a nerf football and he had this growth and he's diagnosed with stage four cancer and so brother travis and me went there yesterday to to encourage him and to also lay hands on him and pray for him and it was just a wonderful powerful the way the lord could spend time to testify about it but the way the lord met us there in that living room with him and his wife and then two for a man and a husband another husband and wife who went to his church and and uh and were there also to in who had lost their son to cancer were there to encourage him and he's been given a death sentence and and brother travis just boldness begins to just change the atmosphere and it begins to testify about the truth and and the way the lord opened his eyes to the message and the way the lord opened his eyes to to the the holy spirit changed his entire life when he raised up his hands and said lord all i ever wanted was you and the world has nothing for me and you could just feel the atmosphere completely changing as he begins to testify to this brother and then then i spoke just for a moment this is what i spoke to him was on on what we're reading here out of this message healing brother brandon preaches this healing and he has a prayer line it's what cancer is and i begin to tell him and testify to him about what cancer is some of the things you're going to read is exactly what i quoted to him before we prayed brother adam says it's like a scavenger buzzer something that eats dead things he says it sets up they backslide and then there sets up another life now look the pollen from the male to the female is a tiny little germ so small the i can't see it it has to be seen through glasses and the first little thing looks like there is a knot tied in that little cell and then it starts in the spine and begins to develop cells and every seed after its kind log after dog human after human foul after foul and so forth according to the male and female now if you'll notice that little germ begins to swell and it forms and that was you one time begin to push out sales push out sales push out cells until it becomes nine months of age born then it becomes an adult woman or a man and here you are today come from one little germ just developing cells sell on cell and he's speaking about a cancer how a cancer begins and he says well now for instance a cancer a cancer comes from a bruise and it's a growth so it's so is tumor cataract and oh we could spend hours on it of what it is now let's say cancer now first it's a teeny little cell and it begins to develop cells it doesn't have any form it just goes anyway spreads out with legs and some wraps around and sums like a rose cancer and diffuses red cancer and black cancer and sarcomas cancer and different varieties of them but they're they're not any certain way because they're a spirit hold on big clue they're a spirit and a spirit has no form that's exactly what i told marcus i said marcus the first thing you need to understand is that growth that's on the side of your neck is just the vehicle it's just the body that's been formed so when we pray a doctor deals with the body a doctor deals and if he can thank god if he can go in there with a knife and he could remove it and he could get every trace and every ounce of it out then wonderful but but but but you got to understand it's not the flesh that when we pray we're not going to pray that the over the flesh but there's a spirit that's under that tumor there's actually a life a living vessel a life and it started with the germ it started with the bruises it started so small and now it builds sale upon cell and now it's formed to where you can visibly see it i feel like some of you are are just struggling with attention here so just take just a moment take a deep breath i believe this is from the lord i want i just feel the holy spirit wanting so hard to remember satan will attack you so that he could hinder someone else from getting their freedom so let's all let's all just pay attention here real close amen he says he says they're not any certain way their spirit and a spirit has no form you say a cancer spirit yes sir i can prove to you that that it is a life and the devil now as old-fashioned as it seems to be but there's not a sickness in the world but what's caused by the devil sickness came from the devil sickness is in a is he said sitting as sickness as a direct or indirect result from sin now watch this maybe not your sin amen maybe not your sin but something you inherited oh there's a reason for everything i'm made a certain way i'm built a certain way i i i'm attracted to certain things i'm disattracted and repeal other things i have a certain personality and i think a certain way there's a reason for everything he says maybe not your sin but something you inherited now he's using a physical thing here like cancer but he reveals to us that beyond that fleshly thing is a spirit i just want to extract from that and say you may label and attach any physical characteristic that you have in your life i want you to realize it's not a temper it's a spirit amen it's not lusting it's a spirit there's a life that's there it's not pride it's a spirit it's not a cancer it's not just not just the form not just what you see visibly it's a spirit and until you recognize you'll keep attacking the symptoms and you'll keep attacking the body and you need to get free of the spirit before we had he says but something you inherited something you didn't even do maybe in your makeup and how you were the sign you were born under we read a lot about that brother adam uses another example of a woman who has heart trouble and he says you're just nervous and you can hear on there and she's shaking and you can hear a voice trembling and brother branham he falls into desert and says it's a lie and he says someone's told a lie on you and she says yes brother branham he says they're they're claiming at that church and he's a man who professes divine healing and he's called you a witch and immediately what happens the spirit the heart disease is the body the heart disease is the physical condition but now brother random doesn't speak to the heart he speaks to the spirit that's hiding behind the body and he says it's a lie they've told a lie on you and immediately that woman begins to say yes and then brother branham says you're not a witch you're a daughter of god and right there she's free what did it take was it hocus pocus and it wasn't that brother all it took was the exposing of the spirit and when the devil's exposed for who he is that's why it's important for you to with your mouth with your mouth i loved our camp that we had and brother diggs said it's important in a prayer line you have a prayer line where kids just pass through and they have their hands that's wonderful i have nothing against that in some youth camps there's too many to pray for everybody but we said we want to do something we've only got about 400 kids we're going to do something different we're going to create a prayer line a prayer line a prayer we're going to have uh five or six ministers and there we were at camp and the reason we did it that way is brother dick says i found in prayer and deliverance it's important that the young person with their mouth speaks what their problem is it's important that they confess with their mouth and they identify not just to generally say i just need the lord you can say that but you've got to speak to the spirit that's tripping you up and say i'm addicted to this and it's a spirit my depression is not who i am my anxiety is not who i am my addiction is not who i am i'm a child of god and i'm going to identify the spirit so that i can be free amen what did brother man do he exposed the devil and the devil when the light of god's word exposes him he has no choice but to run there's a reason for everything heart trouble there was a reason for it are you here he says after sin came he says that maybe not something you did but something you inherited now watch watch this cancer now say oh my hand now there's one there's none there now look at my hand there's no cancer there now there could be someday well there it is then if it's a growth comes on that hand a cancer whatever it may be it's another hello it's another life and we're preaching on on deliverance here this morning to being being changed being delivered he says it's another life it's developing a different cell through it is a cell but it started from a life just like you started first before that little germ that's as far as we can tear your body down to that one single cell then the little germ is a tiny little cell but beyond that cell is a spirit because it's got a life well then that life came from god for you but where did this life this cancer where did this life or death come in your body which it's called cancer who brought that there that's the devil amen that's the devil now jesus called it a devil and by being a minister that terms that's the terms of take that's what the bible says i want you to notice this he says today we see a man that's deaf and dumb the doctors say well his vocal cord is dead his hearing over here his eardrums the nerve died what caused it doctor well i don't know it just died some fever done it or something well why didn't the nerves die all over see it just died there now jesus said that it was a deaf spirit is that right that's when the deaf and dumb spirit came out of a man he could speak and hear now it's just like a transparent band around my hand shutting the circulation off you notice these people come up on the platform here that's deaf and dumb walk off speaking and hearing you can go to this tape and you can scream you can fast forward it to the prayer line and there's a man who comes up completely deaf brother branham says can you hear me man doesn't say anything the prophet of god exposes the devil and then says can you hear me the man says yes i can hear you can you hear that better yes brother hallelujah i'm free i can hear a deaf spirit not a deaf nerve that's dead but he spoke to the life that was squeezing his eardrum and that spirit breaks and the man can hear he says now what happens no man comes here he's deaf you've seen it night after night he can't hear a woman she's looking around now on the ears i want you to notice this because this is exactly what i said to marcus i said marcus now the doctor's doing his job he calls it a cancer scientifically he gave it a name but when i pray i'm not going to call it a cancer i'm going to call it i'm not going to speak to the cancer i'm going to speak to this life that's behind that cancer living amen you say well what did jesus do well look what jesus did when just as mark 9 25 when jesus saw that the people came running together he rebuked the foul spirit saying unto him thou dumb and deaf spirit amen you see there's a reason for everything i charge thee come out of him well that's just the way i was born and i was don't accept the lie of the devil that's just how i was born and i how could god ever judge me i was born this way no no no the bible says that you all have a choice that's what you are born with that's a choice and whether you have a memory or a you're conscious enough to the time when you gave entrance to a spirit doesn't change the fact that the reason you're that way is because you've accepted a spirit amen well i'm suicidal i'm i'm just i'm depressed and i'm i'm i'm this and i've just i've found that i'm just that way i'm i'm this that way just that's how i was born friends i'm not here to attack you or to condemn you i'm here to tell you the lord jesus can set you free of any spirit but you first got to recognize it as a spirit you first got to realize that's not me that's not who i am each is led away when he sins he's led away of his own lusts so you've accepted something somewhere and you're in bondage you're a slave whether you realize it or not you're a slave to that thing but let me give you the good news a slave can be set free and we've got a message of emancipation who can set you free of any spirit let me tell you what the spirit what a what a foul spirit will do in a service like this your message of freedom has been preached and the devil has your mind distracted on a million different things let me tell you what that is that's not you you're a child of god that's the devil pushing thoughts into your mind getting you to think about after the service before the service what's happening in your life because when free you know you know when the devil gets the scaredest when jesus is the closest you when the devil fights the hardest and tries everything to get every kind of thought in your mind he's saying this because and he's talking about and it's just a man he's just listen when jesus is the closest the devil begins to do everything he possibly can because he knows if he's exposed he's got to leave jesus spoke to that spirit and said thou deaf and dumb spirit i charge thee come out of him and enter him no enter no more in them then it's brother adam says then it's an unseen force just like a transparent band around my hand no no matter how much sav you put on the end of this finger brother adam says like a band like a rubber band that's been squeezed onto this hand and he says no matter how much salve you put on this the end of this finger around my hand no matter how much that you put on the end of this finger it's got the circulation shut off and it can't get well until you move this band well i'm just gonna keep coming to church and i'm just gonna i'm just gonna keep doing the same exact thing and i'm just gonna keep on going and keep on going remember i preached years many years ago and brother branham the the the bible actually speaks about the spirit of of of bondage that it's like a snake and it's like a python and a python you know how it kills its prey it doesn't have any venomous bite so it wraps itself around its victim and then every time that that victim breathes in it cinches up just a little tighter and no matter how much salve you put on the forehead of that person or how much you anoint them or how much you pray for them until you break the python the band the spirit that's binding them and every time they breathe in it gets a little tighter they keep coming to church that spirit's still there worship's there shouldn't worship set them free it should there's the preaching of the word there there's the pull of the word the atmosphere is being created but that python every time they breathe in every time they say oh it's just me i was just born this way i could never be free there's no hope for me and then you see them in church and they're anemic they can't even hear the preaching of the word of god say brother matt what do you got to do for someone like that you got to break the spirit there's a reason for everything you speak to it you call it what it is you identify it not me identifying it to you i may not have identified your specific problem through words i've used this morning but you've heard the word and now it's up to you to identify and say this foul spirit that i may not have done anything to deserve and have been somebody else and it was this that or the other but lord i just i'm going to confess it i'm going to repent of it this morning i'm going to raise my hands and say lord i need freedom i recognize the toxic nature of sin that dwells within me i dwell and see inside of me there's no good thing and i want to be free i want to break the ban i want to free the circulation hallelujah he says it's got the circulation shelf it can't get well until you move this band well now that band and the k in this case he says in this case i'm talking about deafness it's the spirit of an unseen person when that thing is cast away of course that gives nature a chance to operate then they begin to hear now cancer begins to develop a body gets larger large it's got one alternative it's got one alternative this is what that cancer inside of you wants to do to you it wants to take your life now all the natural is spiritual you believe that don't you now the cancer come into this store place or that bruised place he took a body he begins to suck on your blood one purpose one purpose take your life the doctor can cut it out if there's one speck of it left it'll start right there growing again now the thing happens in the way if the doctor could operate and take it out that's very well that's good he will take it out now on the doctor's way of destroying my body or your body if you was a cancer would just will be just diminish me from this earth that's all now the way of divine healing it isn't dealing with that body at all it's dealing with the life that's in the body if you was a cancer and i was healing the earth of you being a cancer i'd call your life out of you well there lays your body well your body is just as natural there as it would be if the life was in it it's laying there and every feature and everything now many people don't understand divine healing that's the reason they never get their divine healing they don't realize they're not dealing with the physical outward external problem but the problem is something you were born with [Music] it's a problem with something you're born with i said brother matt i thought you said i was i was not born this way well well here's the one here's the one thing you were born with a carnal nature and that sticky nature can bring into every kind of complex and every kind of fear and anxiety and hurt and pain and you know the devil will give you phantom pain man the devil has sold so many people placebos of pain he'll do anything he can to make you think someone spoke about you or they did it and they had an agenda and they did it because of this and that person be completely oblivious to anything happening and as innocent as as the day is long and but the devil will give you phantom pain well that person and this that they just did this because of this don't you realize that's the devil speaking to you don't you realize that's the devil speaking to you anytime the devil's in your mind whispering he'll be telling you about this person that person said this and they're thinking this and they're just doing this and i'm not part of their group and i must not be good enough and they must not like me in this group over and this person listen friends it's a lie of the devil and until you expose it and say i want free of it it'll keep polluting you and poisoning you and sucking the life out of you amen many people don't understand i want you to notice this here i want you to watch what brother brandon begins to do here i'm just going to close it's 12 50 4 and i just want to i want to come to something and then stop listen the way brother brandon begins to deal with this case of this young man now remember we spoke we we we've taken a lot of time to to lay a good foundation on this so i trust that you just write with me there's a reason to everything and until you identify he said brother matt while i don't have in a in a private interview what would brother branham do he would begin to go in those private interviews and he would begin to listen and diagnose and begin to pray we gave examples of of of a man that goes to a honeymoon he comes back he goes there's blows up doesn't know why he's angry as brother says just just marry this man he's wonderful he's happy but you know something triggered something something triggered in him and he comes back and the marriage is about just right starting about to end and brother branham says just then he said the lord just revealed what it was and he said and set that man free takes that woman as we gave remember a story of the woman who was chased by that dog when she was a little girl and she lives her entire life because of a fear there was a spirit that came upon her and it haunted her and haunted her and haunted her and troubled her she was nervous and brother brandon begins to diagnose and goes in discernment looks at her life and says when you were just a little girl you were chased by a dog that put a fear inside of you you didn't realize it you didn't recognize it but you've grown up with that life that's been growing and growing and growing and growing like a tumor and there's a spirit there and it's haunting you and it's tripping you up and it's making you the way that you are and brother branham you you say brother matthew then then what what what what do you do for a person the work actually at that point if the woman would just accept it the work's over it's over the devil's exposed he already knows man he's three miles up the road because it's not the job of brother brandon remember brother and says i'm not the healer i can't heal you but if jesus were here and he says and he was here as a man he'd lay his hands on you and he'd do sometimes he would take earth he would take as we said here preach the last time he'd spit into the ground and he'd he'd take some put some mud over their eye like this you say why was jesus doing that because jesus had had a was trying to get you to understand there's a connection between the physical world and the spiritual world and what you do physically has a reaction spiritually i testified to marcus of sister elena curlett sister elena butts there in minden and brother tim's church testified to her we stood the pictures here some number of years ago and and he this marcus his wife had just got through telling me he was diagnosed with hodgkin's lymphoma and i and i told her i said that's a and stage four said you know i got a good friend of ours who's at a church just uh louisiana there and she was diagnosed the day before christmas or the day after day before right near christmas was diagnosed with hodgkin's lymphoma stage four same exact thing showed him the pet scan which he showed me marcus his wife mary showed us the pet scan of marcus and you could see the lumps you could see the cancer and i said here's her pet skin and you could see in in elena's arms here in the pet scan like this and you could see this lump that was here this big black spot of this cancer and i was just testifying to him and i said see right there's her before and i said but sister elena had been prayed for and she'd been praying and asking the lord to touch her and to heal her of this and and she was in a service in a service in a church service on a sunday morning i said no it doesn't have to be church we we can traditionalize things doesn't have to be church but she was in church that sunday morning she's sitting there and the word was going forth and this after the word went forth they were singing i said the lord just said something came upon her heart and something came upon her spirit she said david danced before the lord and the with the when the ark was returned and and marry him took a tambourine and danced and sister elena said she got up out of her seat and as awkward as it was as much as it might have embarrassed her as much as people might have thought she's crazy what's she doing i said she started running around the church you can go back online and go to brother tim's website and see sister elena jumping like this running across the church doing a jericho march hallelujah hallelujah she said the lord just anointed her faith to do that what was it she was doing something physically and it got the attention of something spiritually remember brother brandon picks up that rock and he throws it up in the air and it started a little whirlwind and an earthquake strunk a lot salmo sankulaski said what was it something in the physical dimension atta attached itself to a spiritual dimension and i said now here she went days later for her pet scan and i said here's the new pet scan and the cancer is completely gone completely clear that's two or three years ago she's living cancer free today from stage four hopkins lymphoma because why there was a spirit not the cancer that was exposed and something that had been infesting and something had been laying in her life is now set free because something physically something that she did maybe all you have to do this morning is just physically outwardly with your own lips and vocal cords confess it and say lord i want free there's freedom here this morning in this church on this sunday morning on march 13th there's freedom here this morning and slaves can be set free may have something that bound you and tied you up tied up your mind maybe in your spirit god can set you free of that watch how brother brandon begins to deal with something in this young man he says for instance a few moments ago a few days ago i was called in on the scene or a little something going on there was a fine young man very fine boy he was going with the girl very fine little girl out of a fine family this boy all of a sudden came up with some of an idea he just walked away he did something wrong to the little girl as much as promised her to do a certain thing and then he didn't do it and instead of coming to the girl and apologizing like a gentleman should do it just wasn't in him to do it there's a reason for everything he couldn't apologize unforgiveness couldn't say he was sorry and the father and mother called me to the scene and said we would desire to know what's wrong with her boy now it's not easy to do sometimes but you must be truthful and honest therefore the boy was a christian now notice you've got to follow this close the boy was a christian as far as a believer that's going to clarify that here in a moment he was a christian what is a christian a person who names the name of christ that's the terminology brother branham is using here as far as a believer he wasn't born again you mean you can be a professed christian a professed believer not be born of the spirit yes amen he had repented he had been baptized he had his position among the believers yet had not received the baptism of the holy spirit all that was before the seals ah let's look at the date there 63 august yeah he had not received the baptism of the holy spirit no matter how much he thought no matter how much mom thought no matter how much dad thought no matter how much the pastor thought no matter how much the rest of the church had saw amen amen he had not received the baptism of the holy ghost you thinking you have and having it is two different things you might be able to try to say you have you might be able to show some evidence of some emotions but unless your life is vindicating what you're professing to have you still haven't got it we preach against a lot of things about your life what it manifests why brother matter we all about sin all about how we dress no but your dress identifies how you what's what's happened took place in your life where you go identifies if your life is coping with the word what you watch identifies and it's not to identify to criticize you it's to get you to recognize to open your eyes he says unless your life copes he says he says but unless your life is vindicating what you're professing you still haven't got it no matter how many emotions how much you jump run sensations speaking in tongues or shouting whatever you might lay upon which is all right i believe in all that too but unless your life copes with your testimony you haven't got it help us lord make our call in an election can somebody say that with me here can we unify as bethel tabernacle and say help us to make our call in and he go if you raise your hands if you want to unify with that and say lord help us to make our call in an election sure to work out our own salvation with fear and trembling [Music] amen and he says unless then you have it because the fruit of the spirit vindicates what you are just like the fruit of any tree tells you what it is jesus said by their fruits you shall know them now this young fellow's parents his mother why are you going to his parent why brother branham would you go to his mom and dad there's a reason for everything i want you to chill i want to challenge you here this morning there's a reason for everything now the father uh this the mother is german no reflection on the german but there's a strain in that family that is they'll just sit you can talk to them they'll just stare you right in the face like a lot of people this morning this girl's sister the mother of this boy her sister i've come down the street many morning this young lady being sitting out in the yard i'd say good morning to you she just looked at me i'd stop and i'd say sure a fine morning she would just stand look right at you an intelligent woman and i'd say come up to see us sometime she'd just stand and look well her brothers are the are that way father and mother is that way there's a strain on that family born of the spirit of god the father and mother were hold on logjam no don't let your minds explode there are strains upon that family that are not removed with the baptism of the holy ghost it's something you're at war with and you've got to fight and you've got to starve out that old nature and feed the new nature or else that old nature will bring you back into bondage say a believer well didn't paul say be you not entangled again with a yoke of bondage wherewith christ has set you free father and mother that way now the father of the boy let's go to the father is strictly an irishman moody high tempered high strong you could think of a lot of people brother brannon was thinking about himself because this is his family that's his whole family like that except one other out of the family converted now in this this boy the father and mother both are christians filled with the holy ghost and they have brought this young man up in the way of the lord now the young man is about 17 or 18 years old something along there very fine kid he's been a real model boy at home nice kid he's got a brother that's just vice versa but the girls the mother's family lives close to a fine church but do you think they'd ever come over there no they know it's right but it's just not in them to ask forgiveness or ask pardoning isn't it incredible brother branham says some of the family goes to this church and other of the family go to the church down the road now why is that brother matt because they can't ask for forgiveness it's amazing his brother jason i was streaming last night he was preaching brother john andy's his title pride and his prisoners it's amazing how much what pride will do to a believer they know it's right but it's just not in the natural forgiveness they're part of them they just won't do it it's just not in them now the genes in the father and the mother of this boy no matter how much they are converted still remains the flesh that's been interbred out to this boy therefore the boy has got a complex in him remember brother adam says the sin maybe not your sin there's a reason for everything therefore the boy's got a complex just like his mother's family they are not forgiving they will not apologize that's where the boy stands now i said to the father no matter how much you've raised him up i said now look at you out of now watch what brother brandon does here so careful you follow this i'm going to close i promise right here brother dick says but i mean it fixing the clothes are you awake watch how brother brandon begins because he's diagnosing remember a doctor who didn't really care about you remember this look here remember a doctor who doesn't really care about you what will he do well the doctor doesn't care about you remember he just gives you the pill get out go you're good he says but a real doctor will diagnose the case so here's a real doctor he says now i said to the father no matter how much you've raised him up i said now look at you look at you speaking to the dad dads what's wrong with my son man he just ain't got no way to forgive you he's got this little problem i need your help brother branham now look at you talking to the dad out of your family all of them drunks fighting shooting and cutting and so forth now look at your family to the mother now he points to the mother there are a bunch of people just sit there and won't speak very independent so forth irreverent to religion but i said it's not you you're the only one of all your sisters and brothers and you're sweet kind and forgiving what does that your tree part of that family tree yet you have received the holy ghost that's the thing that made you tender and sweet it's not your people anymore it's your christ that lives in you it's not your people when you're really born of the spirit of god you are no longer bound it may be a point of influence but you are no longer bound by anything in your past that ought to set you free this morning when you are born of the spirit of god you are no longer a slave to your past that's not your people anymore that's your christ that lives in you i said to the boy this is to the this is to the father look at your family practically all of them are drunks i said and how moody and high tempered and high strung but you're not you're kind you're forgiving what is it say brother matt what is that sweet nature what is that thing that wants to forgive what is that thing that desires though i may not know how to perform it what is it in me that craves for the word of god what is it inside of me that when i hear the preaching of the word i raise my hands and say amen what is it in me that when i sin i fight just feel so guilty and i just repent and feel so sorry it's not you brother or sister that's your christ that's living down inside of you that's the real you that's the real part of you that's eternal that will never fade away he says you're kind you're forgiving what is it that's the holy spirit you're no more what you are it's christ in you and i said now that same thing has to happen to your son amen the father raised up much like many parents do much like i'm sure i would have my son went to the altar he was baptized correctly in the name of jesus and water baptism in the pool said i know my son has come to christ i said may be all right the outward emotions he might be identified as a believer with believers but until he's regenerated born again i'd advise that young man to never marry a woman why because pain transfers to pain let me just say this and i'm just gonna just pause just for a moment this is why it's so important you know none of us are perfect none of us are good oh my god but it's so important before a man lord help us to teach this correctly to our young people lord help us to be good examples in our life you could never lead someone to a place you've never been yourself you may be able to try and give them directions i could tell you how to get to a person's house but if i've never been there before i can't lead you there myself and it's amazing how many times someone never confronts their own self and never can open up their heart enough to them own self you know sometimes you lie and some of the biggest persons we deceive is our self you never face who you are as a person and you never open up all your channels and open up every corner and give the lord every key and you take those same people who have never really dealt with the pain from a dad or from a mom or from a pastor or done wrong or a church or bitterness or some situation if you never and you block that and you defend that and you just don't want to touch that and then you attach yourself to a wife and you get married and then you have children and that unprocessed and undealt with issue now that pain is just going to be transferred to another generation it's important we clean out the channels brother i say this morning lord clean them all out clean out every channel lord purge my mind purge my spirit let me be able to confront my own self in the mirror anything i see that's not according to the life of christ well it's just my personality you need to stop saying that because your personality needs to be the person of jesus that's why brother branham says i'd advise him don't get married he'll make hell on earth for her until that gentle sweet forgiving spirit of christ comes in i just want to raise my hand maybe you want to say it with me and say let that humble gentle sweet forgiving spirit of christ let it come in i invite you lord to come in if i've blocked you out if something's hindered you out of my life i'm raising my hands in front of all these people in front of everybody and saying let that humble gentle forgiving sweet caring kind compassionate spirit let it come in brother branham says then that will be a paradox in itself musicians could you come then that will be a paradox stand to your feet and that will be a paradox until that gentle humble caring forgiving spirit comes in just gonna wait a moment being changed that's what we're preaching on being changed remember what we said last time you're constantly evolving you should constantly be growing we should constantly be changing don't ever hold on to anything let it go say lord let me move past it move past it brother adam says that'll be a paradox to take the very nature of a boy that's bred between father and mother and yet in his intellectuals he's trying his best to overcome it amen you might be trying your best you might be trying you might have tried your best for 30 years he says he's trying his best to overcome it he can't do it he'll never overcome it christ will have to overcome it when he lets christ in then he's already overcome then i love how brother branham says this i wish i could highlight it in green and neon and flashing when a man it'll be a perfect paradox when a man is born a life a spirit of batting ground just like we talked about that cancer that it has a body the holy spirit needs a tabernacle it needs a temple to live in when a man is born of the spirit of god by your head's with me every head bowed every eye closed i wonder how many people we live with we even ourselves on how many spiritually not talking naturally here but if we would really to diagnose the case not just throw out a pill to give to everybody and you just need to conform and you just need to change you just you just need this and you're just not like us because of this i wonder if we were really to take the time and let a person face them themselves let me do it this morning lord i want to raise my hands up and say let me do it this morning let me fall under the knife let me fall under that surgeon's hand this morning god has your spirits moving in this place over every heart and every life don't let us resist it lord this morning lord they're not resisting me we resist this morning we're resisting you let us give over let us give up let me fall into that surgeon's hand this morning and let me not be just a person who just throws out a quick easy solution but if we were really to diagnose the case or really to look into the innermost part of our heart we don't have a prophet here to sit you down in a private interview and to diagnose you and tell you what happened when you were two and three and four and five but friends let me just tell you we don't need that this morning because the bible says that the word of god is a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart and let me just say it to you in case so i can so i can silence the mouth of the devil your life every single life that's here has been diagnosed this morning while you've sat there in your chair the lord jesus has slowly diagnosed the case and now you're sitting there at your seat this morning satan's been exposed it's up to you to reach out and take it i wonder how many people if we were to really diagnose we'd speak we'd see spiritually spiritual handicaps spiritual wheelchair spiritual blindness spiritual nerves where the ear has been pinched and cut off and hearts that have been hardened can't even hear the word of god anymore but i want to send out a freedom call this morning i want to let you know this morning the light of the gospel has shined it's shining right now the devil's up the road brother he's not there sister all you got to do is believe it you first got to raise hands and say lord i accepted this morning i accept freedom this morning jesus you're the great physician lord not man help us lord jesus to care enough you said he cares do you care let us care one for another let us love one another help us to be changed where our attitude is right where we look at things correctly help me to be that mother who you've called me to be help me to be that father who you've called me to be to feel the void of that young child help me to be the teacher help me to be the husband help me to be the leader that you need me to be god i give it all to you i raise up my hands this morning and say help me to change lord what i can't change come and change it inside of me jesus i pray granted lord to every life every heart jesus i just ask you lord come in a supernatural way maybe to one maybe someone listening live it's got their hands up right now tears flowing down their face maybe it's to you sister maybe it's to you brother maybe you're sitting there in your chair maybe this morning driving maybe you're here in this congregation maybe there and it's not today and you're listening behind archive but the lord jesus is here right now and all you got to do is reach out and accept it in faith sister elena just reached out in faith she took a hold of a promise and god backed up what she did god can back it up this morning god can come and ah he honors his own word and satan has no authority he's just a bluff he's a liar he's a trespasser who may be hid under a cancer and but let me not call it let me speak to that spirit this morning let me confess it let me call it literally really what it is say satan you're on offense to me you're a liar satan you've been exposed you've been trying to suck the blood and the life out of me but i stand here today confessing my sins repenting of my sins and jesus is here to accept me to make me new again [Music] healing so your prophet called that message healing what cancer really is what sin really is we need it lord more than ever before we needed god more than ever before we need people that find true conversion and find true feeling an indwelling of a supernatural power lord more than ever before if we've ever emphasized the to be born of the spirit of god lord it's more than ever before we ought to be preaching it we ought to be telling it to our young people telling it to our old people you must be born again you must make your call in an election sure to seek out your own salvation with fear and trembling oh more than ever before let that message be emphasized so that we can trim our lamps this morning going home time is right around the corner it's about time to leave this world and the call is going forth trim your lamps bride trim your lamps trim your lamps maybe it might be the last call this morning might be your last opportunity might be your last chance here on march 13th god writes down the date jubilee calls one more time come and be set free it's for you it's for you don't believe that it is and it's for you he's for you right now don't accept any substitute young person don't accept any excuse or any lie of the devil don't accept any substitute that satan tries to give you or any justification cast it down it's a vain imagination cast it down say lord nothing in my hands i bring simply to your cross i clean oh as that man said oh son of david have mercy on me maybe you could cry that this morning and say son of david have mercy on me i need you jesus i need you to change me i need you to change my life i need you to burn out as brother branham said that old nature i need you to come and come and let the holy ghost i accept it this morning come and let it burn out that nature that's inside of me come and let re be remove it from its throne and you lord take your throne this morning sit upon the throne of my heart oh you don't need to wait for a youth meeting you don't need to wait for a special prayer or special service brother sister god's just impressing me to say that to you this morning god's trying to deal with your heart and satan will fight you the hardest when jesus is the closest satan will give you every pack of lies he can sitting in your seat under the sound of my voice he'll fight you the hardest when jesus is the closest and he's asking you this morning will you be made whole will you be made whole it's here for you right now healing is here freedom is here jesus is here oh can we sing that jesus is here healing is here i lift my hands jesus is here it's freedom is here right now young person freedom is here you don't have to be a slave anymore you might have been bound by that spirit for 10 years might have wondered why it's tripping you up well there's a reason for everything and satan's been exposed this morning you can be free you can be free you don't have to live under the bondage of a mother of a father of a past you don't have to live to live under the bondage you're not slave to anything this morning you've been set free god's trying to tell you this morning this very morning you could live a life where your testimony can say it's no longer my people anymore it's no longer my people anymore it's no longer my last name anymore it's my jesus living down inside of me he could come and clean you out and clean scrub you down and purge you of your guilt you've got guilt this morning guilt of sin satan will try to give you every kind of violent substitute to how to manage that guilt that's plaguing your mind but jesus is here to start drawing in the sand and say he who is without sin let him cast the first stone you're set free daughter it's free for it's freedom for you this morning it's freedom for you son right now you can receive it in the name of jesus you don't have to give way you don't have to give a substitute for your guilt god can wash you oh god god can wash it from your mind at your seat this morning sing that for me brother tony if you could [Music] thank
