amen do you want to touch him tonight god bless you good to be here in the house of the lord if you have your bible let's turn to romans chapter seven amen romans chapter seven we're just going to read on just a few verses from here we spoke this message being changed in three parts and we just want to take another part to that here tonight romans chapter 7 you love the lord amen appreciate his presence amen being here with us amen he never fails to show up amen we're glad for that let's just begin reading here at verse 14. for we know that the law is spiritual but i am carnal sold under sin for that which i do i allow not for what i would that do i not what i hate that do i if then i do that which i would not i can send to the law that it is good now there is no more i that do it but sin that dwelleth in me for that for i know that in me now we took time the last time and i'm just going to pause here just for a moment because i just want to bring you right up to where i'm at here tonight i want you to notice that when paul uses this word and he says for i know let's read it there in the beginning for i know that in me so there's a distinction that paul makes here and they put it in the parentheses in the king james that is in my flesh so what you're finding out here in romans 7 is that there's more to me than just this right there's more to me there's more to you than just what you see in the mirror but there's another part of you and that's what we're gonna speak on here tonight we're just going to take this title being changed this will be part 4. let's keep reading for i know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing how many can identify for to will is present with me but how to perform that which is good i find not for the good that i would i do not but the evil which i would not that i do let's just move on down to verse 21. i find then a law that when i would do good evil is present with me for i delight now here's i speaking about me i myself me who am i and now he's going to switch to another part of me for i delight in the in the law of god after now this isn't the flesh after the inward man so he says in verse 23 but i see another law in my members warring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members lord we ask for your grace tonight special lord request here tonight father i ask that for lord for me to be able to completely surrender lord just to move myself out of the way believing lord god that you ordain church service lord and you would ordain the people that would be here tonight lord by divine appointment that's what we believe here tonight lord that god you have something you have something lord upon your mind that you want to speak to your children i pray god that you would help every individual those streaming those that are here present lord may we be sensitive to your voice as it speaks to your children we pray in jesus name amen you can be seated the first powerpoint i sent brother jason i sent the last one being changed part one i just want to pull that up and i want you just to read because i i just feel like it's relevant to read this again i know we read it one time but i just want to read this again and i just believe we can garner and gather so much on this you really could preach this uh in many many more parts brother branham is asked in 1964 and questions and answers he's asked about this romans 7. if you'll notice uh he relays the entire question of what we did the text we just read and then at the very end you'll see at the bottom his question this i cannot understand as brother branham answers that he says let me kind of polish it up so you can see he said in me is two persons right one wants me to do wrong the other wants me to do and brother branham is going to say right and every time i start to do right then the wrong hinders me how many of you people on the interviews this afternoon has run that same thing and this morning i thought it was incredible because you never know really what's in those private interviews because they're private but brother burnham gives us some insight and says this same question has came up in the interviews you're coming to me how many of you people have asked the same question brother adam's referring to romans 7 that when i want to do good though i know that i'm born of the spirit of god i know i've passed from death unto life i know that there's been a change inside of me yet still i find myself that i'm still in a struggle sometimes to do that which the word says for me to do how many angel wings you want to you want to take off those angel wings and halos and throw them outside brother branham says this is this is the struggle this is the battle you were questioning this in the private interviews you were asking the same exact question uh why i why i know that i'm born of the spirit of god yet i still have struggles in my flesh and so brother adam says you've run into that same thing this morning see we are carnal and that part must perish and then inside we are a spirit man soul inside and that's faith in god's word then we bring our outside body how many has an outside body we bring our outside body oh you mean you didn't lose that outside body when you were born of the spirit y'all are here none of y'all are angels here tonight you're not in hearing theophanies are you am i speaking to the real you but you're born again yet you've received the baptism of the holy ghost but you still have an outside body and he says then we bring our outside body under subjection to the word by faith here's how by accepting what god said how brother matt do i overcome how do i bring this body under subjection to the word by faith except what god said what is saying amen to the word it's not a verbal amen it's it's something that you do with your life your life is amen in the word mary amen the word and it produced something inside of her right how can i take a cockapoo now he goes to this cocklebur and and he's going to use this example and he says and make a grain of wheat i have a cockle burn a grain of wheat how am i ever going to make it into a grain of wheat it's impossible for me to do it the only way it can be is because inside that cocklebur has been transmitted from a cocklebur wheat a cocklebur to a germ called wheat life then you bury that cocklebur and it'll produce a grain of wheat that's right because there has been a life of wheat put into the cockapoo and the life of the cockleboro has been taken out but the nature of the cocklebur is still sticky so what happens when you're born of the spirit of god now this is not something an anointing it's not it's more than an anointing of the spirit on your flesh brother adam says i'm afraid we've replaced the true baptism of the holy ghost with an intellectual experience of just accepting the word and you accept the word intellectually in your mind and that's a good thing you believe it with your mind there's many people who believe and are believers of the word of god but that doesn't mean that they're born of the spirit of god you say how can you say about that brother matt well let's go to the book of james you believe in god you do well for the devil and his angels also believe in god yet they're not born of the spirit of god so many people brother madam says they've replaced the baptism of the holy ghost the true baptism for an intellectual understanding or an intellectual reasoning i think that sounds good so i accept it so there's a part of them that's been changed but the soul the nature has never been changed and then he comes comes into another place and brother branham says and i'm afraid they've replaced the baptism of the holy ghost with some emotion and he says and because they think because they can shout that they've been born again or they think because they've danced or done some outwardly fleshly emotion that they've been born again and then brother branham says that and i'm not gonna this is an exact quote i'm just uh paraphrasing it but he says but when when do you brother adam says when do you know that something has really came when your life is divvying up with the bible when your life is producing something when your nature has changed from an old carnal snake to the nature of a dove because that's the nature of the spirit right and he says he says let's just go back to this because there's been a life we've put in the cockroach the life of the cockroach has been taken out but the nature of the cocklebur is still sticky and it will be until this new life has been fully been developed all right so what do we find out about the baptism of the holy ghost the true baptism of the holy ghost this is going to be a paradoxical statement the baptism of the holy ghost changes everything right but yet it doesn't change everything the baptism of the whole are you awake here tonight the but the baptism of the holy ghost changes everything but yet it doesn't change everything say how can you say that brother matt because it will eventually change everything but right now there's still a part of you it hasn't changed yet you've got a deposit of the holy ghost you've got a down payment it's the earnest but one day you're going to get the more than just the earnest you're going to get full payment and when you get full payment you say brother matt when will this go away brother madam's notice here he says that the nature of the cocker bar is still sticky and it will be until this new life has fully been developed out of the grant out of the ground and raised up again when it comes forth then it's no more cuckleburg but wheat but while it's here on earth how many are still here on earth unfortunately you might be caught away in heavenly places and that's a wonderful thing but sometimes it takes the life to bring you back to reality to make you realize you're still here and he says but while it's here on earth out of the earth and a cocklebur it's still sticky but it's got the nature of the inside of it of wheat that's why paul said i desire after law i i long for the word of god for the law of god after the inward man and as long notice and as long as you're in this life how many still in this life say brother matt why do you keep saying that because i want to take away the devil's on your mind and your body here tonight of how can i i don't even know sometimes i feel like i'm i'm i i'm completely set free other times i'm questioning have i ever even known the lord at all i can get to such a high and then such a low and i could come crashing down and then question myself and the devil begins to bombard my mind he begins to attack me and influence my spirit gets me depressed and down and i'm i'm wondering whether i'm saved or i'm not saved am i in or on my out but god's word is here to set you free from any oppressive spirit and help you understand yourself that there's still a part of you that's still here in the earth say brother matt when will it go away when you turn 18 for the second time for the second time it'll be gone hallelujah hallelujah i'm looking forward to turning 18 a second time some of you say brother might have not even turned 18 yet you're going to one day he says but on the notice this as long as you're in this life you're going to be sticky and have a carnal nature that's going to bother you now if it doesn't bother you that's a problem that's right hello everybody here you wait if it doesn't bother you that's a problem if you're content with the sin in your flesh that means your net you've probably never tasted of the lord at all but if it's bothering you that's don't you realize if you're bothered here by your own mistakes and faults and failures it's proof god has changed something inside of you to put a desire to for something to reach for and say i may not be there yet as the woman said i'm not i may not be what i want to be but i know i'm not what i used to be notice as long as you live but the inside of you you're born again and when you're raised up you're in the likeness of christ and all the sin has gone from you see that's the thing something this is brother brandon begins to tell actually let's pause that just for a moment so notice here go to the second powerpoint that you could brother jason the one the second one that i sent you should have an uh the first one it was the first one that i sent but it's the second one that i need i want you to notice what the prophet says so he says you're you're made up of a triune being that's what the prophet teaches us over and over again that's why paul says oh wretched man what was that wretched part of him that wretched part of him was that there was a part of him that loved the lord with all of his heart there but there was another dog and brother and later in that quote begins to talk about that the old indian chief and he says chief which one of them wins the fight whichever one she feeds the most and brother aaron says see there it's whichever one you cater to whichever one you cater to so he says you're you're made up of body soul and spirit there's three parts of you and there's a part of you that's completely set free from the curse and the dominion of sin i want to spawn i just want to stop here for a moment and say this there's a part of you remember brother madam says there's two persons there's two lives two distinct lives that are at war all the time they're constantly pressuring you i i spoke of this sunday when we when we did sunday school and brother branham's telling and he's expressing in one place in his life of how that he gave his heart to the lord and he said i begin to serve the lord and he says but you know i should i ought to have served the lord many years before i surrendered and he says but a spirit hung over my life that hindered me or prevented me so what do you take away from that that there was there's a spirit that is always a demonic influence that's always there trying to use your five senses trying to use doubt trying to use fear trying to use your senses of your spirit and he'll use whatever channel you surrender to him to to prevent you and hinder you from becoming influenced from the angelic inspiration and anointing that's trying to affect you and influence you so brother madam says i would have given my heart to the lord many years before and he says but a spirit hung over me so there was something that was there trying to hinder him to prevent him he's asking questions and answers and he's asked about guardian angels and the person asked the question do you believe in that or is that of myth or fairy tale and brother adam says absolutely it's true yes the angels of god encamp those or surround those that fear him right and he uses the example of the servant of elijah and he's he's surrounded they're surrounded by an entire army and the prophet praise and says lord open his eyes for they that be with us are more than they with them and the the lord opened the servant's eyes and he seen the hillsides were surrounded by angelic armies and angelic chariots and angelic horses and there were more of them than there were with the devil i want you to know no matter how surrounded you may feel in your life and no matter how outnumbered the devil tries to tell you that you are there are more with you than with the devil there are more with the family of god that's why the the bible speaks of the god of angel armies the lord of hosts that is the translation of lord of hosts mighty in battle psalms 46 he breaketh the bow he burns the chariot with fire he's the lord of hosts david begins to sing psalms 46 and he says for the lord is an ever-present help in the time of trouble he's the lord of hosts in other words to the family of god he's always accessible he's always available he no matter how where how low or whatever place you go the bible says the lord is an ever-present help in the time of trouble what does that mean let me remind you of what you have available to you the lord is available to you any time the lord is available to the family of god in distress at the moment you say how how do i how do i call him how do i how do i make use of that just open your mouth and begin to call on the name of the lord he's right there he's an ever present help in the time of trouble he maketh words to cease if you go read psalms 46 just a powerful psalm but brother adam says there was a spirit there and he says of course guardian angels are real so what do you find there's a spirit that's hanging over the prophet preventing him from surrendering his life to the lord and he goes years beyond when he would have but something hung over him you say brother matt does that what does that mean that means that there's always in your life you're always caught in between two influences you're always being whispered to in one ear by the enemy and you're always being encouraged in one ear by the lord you're always being encouraged you're always being strengthened god's always trying to reach you he's always reaching out to you and at the same time the devil's always always there trying to fight you and trying to discourage you listen to me friends it is you are in a spiritual warfare that is not a battle of flesh and blood but the apostle paul in ephesians 6 says it's a spiritual battle that the weapons uh that the the the the battle that we face is not a against flesh and blood but spiritual wickedness in high places that word high places speaks of atmospheres demonic atmospheres and angelic atmospheres and you're subjected in a body that's not it's born of the spirit of god but you still got five senses you still got five senses of the flesh that can tempt you and tell you wrong and lead you wrong and direct you wrong you've got five senses in your spirit that'll try to lie to you using your memory and a lot of you using an imagination it'll lie to you using your affection your conscience but then you've got a man down in the in the control room of the heart brother branham says now that man in that control room pushes the buttons and pulls the levers if you'll surrender to him if you'll clean out the channels and let the come under the influence of the angels and not the spirits you'll find more victory in your life it's not that you're not born of the spirit of god and that's what the devil will try to tell you it's not that you're not born again now i'm speaking to believers here it's not that you're not that you're not filled with the holy ghost it's that those channels of that part of you that's not been changed yet but it's being changed you see as a believer you're being changed you're in the process of being changed one day there will come a final change and everything changes but right now you're renewed the bible says the that you're you're renewed day by day right that the spirit of god is there to encourage you that's what the preaching of the word of god is for that's what prayer is for that's what reading your bible is for that's why hearing god's the voice of god's prophet in your ear say why in your ear because you got enough trash from the devil coming into your ear also you better be hearing the voice of god and feeding on it and filling your vessel up with it as much as you can say well we don't need tapes we need tapes we don't need preachers we need preachers we don't need church we need church we can just play homes that play play tapes at home you're right you should be playing tapes at home we don't need church yeah we need church we don't need evangelists we need them we don't need teachers we need them we don't need preachers we need them listen you need everything let me just say this we need everything that god has made available you need to draw from every resource i don't need my brothers and my sisters i can just stay at home and stream you need them i don't need fellowship i'm just a quiet individual and i just would rather just be to myself and come to church that's a devil lying to you you need a local body that you connect with i may not be getting a lot of amen but that's not going to stop me here tonight the lord's given me my commission you you i don't i don't need to really come to church you need church you need the connection that god's given you you need to make you need to avail yourself of every weapon that god has put in your arsenal brother adam you go type in the quote the greatest weapon that god ever gave to man you know what you'll find one weapon is prayer one weapon the greatest weapon brother adam says his prayer brother brown says the greatest weapon is love another place he says the greatest weapon is faith what is the greatest weapon all of the weapons god has given his family but we've got to use them you've got to utilize them you can't they're not just going to fall on your lap they're not just going to fall out of the sky and i'm just going to go to church and and by osmosis it'll just change me no you've got to be dying out to the old man you've got to be constantly be re being filled and refilled and filled and refilled and filled and emptying out and then filling back in and emptying out and filling back in so there was a part of him he said that the angel he said uh the the angel of the lord and god surround those and camp those who fear him but then there was a spirit that was always trying to hinder him remember and we we spoke on this and brother adam teaches this doesn't say this directly he tells brother lonnie jenkins relays this story that he gives to a brother but the the essence of it is that when a person is not born of the spirit of god he says inside on the throne of the heart unconverted as an unconverted person on the throne of your heart is the devil the nature that you were born with not that you're a bad person but you are a bad person not that you're an evil person but you are an evil person as a and that didn't you didn't ask anybody for that you didn't didn't do anything the bible paul says the creature was made subject unto vanity not willingly but by reason of who whom created him the same in hope so he was subjected to it that's how he was made and he says i when you're born in the world you're unregenerate now you may have good parents and you may be raised in a good christian home that's wonderful but until that nature has changed until there's something an experience comes and changes and takes the snake out of your heart and puts in his spirit you're not even in the battle yet wow and brother madam says on the throne of that heart is the devil and he's uh as that spirit and he's calling he's the man in the control room he's pushing the buttons he's pulling the levers say how can a man go into a school and mow down children and take a gun because there's a demon spirit the world is in a neurotic state and that nature of that of that carnal nature of that fallen man is a beast he's a brute beast that's what the bible calls him and so the man pulling the levers and pushing the buttons he surrendered so much to that spirit that's within him and brother madam says but what happens when you're born of the spirit of god that man is removed from the throne that's that evil nature is removed from the throne of the heart and now christ is on the throne and he says and and the the way that he relays it is in that in the the testimony he gave to the brother as he says that nature now removes from a position of throne room and he moves to a position of influence and now he's there to try to try to influence you and there listen he he he's in god is the bible says in psalms 46 he's an ever-present help the lord is an ever-present help in the time of trouble let me just say this the devil is an ever-present enemy always there thank god we got an ever-present help he's an ever-present enemy always busy tirelessly trying to disrupt notice what brother branham says here now that a devil is almost harmless until unless he can have something to work in he's gone you remember those devils that were cast out of out of legion they had they wanted to do more mischievous so they wanted to go into the hogs so devils must have something to work in somebody to work through how much can the devil do through me as much access as you're willing to give him how much can the devil control me as much as you allow him brother branham says the devil's almost harmless unless he can have something to work in so satan can only have his i hope you catch this he can only have as much victory as you allow to say to a born against child of god he has no access unless you open the door say brother matt while i would never devil comes knocking on my door i would never open the door you see the problem is the devil's approach he doesn't come with you know as looking like the boogeyman he comes in a little complex comes in a little hurt feeling and he uses your memory i remember what that brother said and what they did to me and you don't even realize it's the devil and you're giving him access into your spirit and you've given that the devil access to this and you do it through the five gates through your eyes through your ears what you listen to even what you say do we realize how cr how important how much emphasis god puts on what words come out of our mouth well that just slipped out no it didn't just slip out [Music] out of the abundance of the heart jesus said the mouth speaks so you you your words what how we speak what we say jesus said for i say unto you every idol word that a man speaketh he shall give an account thereof james speaks of it jesus spoke of it and james speaks about the control that a person that the control is like a rudder of a ship such a tiny little bitty rudder he says yet it turns the entire ship the whole ship is turned by that little bitty rudder and he's using it to show you how powerful the tongue is by the words and james says for bio jesus says for by thy words thou shalt be justified or by thy words thou shalt be condemned so we allow these spirits to come out and then they come out and we speak it and it can come out in many different forms you you speak against somebody and gossip and begin to backbite remember that quote we read on sunday and brother branham says he says you take a person and they begin to criticize the church and all this isn't right and this isn't right and brother branham says that's sulfuric acid it's demon power that's sulfuric acid you shouldn't be corrosive as a christian a believers we we said it sunday it's an attribute of of a christian to be kind it's not an attribute of a christian to be rude you can be stern you can be uncompromising you can be unwavering but i say lord help us to temper how many can say it with me help us to temper our spirits and sprinkle our correction with love with not not worldly love of i just love everybody and i accept everybody give me the love of jesus you can have the perverted with love of the world love is corrective but it's correct of love it's love correction that comes with love a devil is almost harmless unless you have something to work and he's got you remember those devils he says so the devils must have something to work in somebody to work through and satan can only his power he's god has just perverted power it isn't real no real power adultery and act misused the righteous hack misuse everything that satan has has got something that was perverted but it's a power and we are today setting here and one one or the other power is going to control us one or the other power is going to control our actions what are the other powers going to control our decisions and the choices that we make brother branham says and i love this one or the other is going to con is going to control us so let's cast the evil one let's cast out the evil one let's take our position like the stars of the heavens then what does that do notice now brother brandon begins to take this and i didn't want to just flood you with quotes i could have just posted more of these but i'll paraphrase some of these brother brandon begins to talk about how that you're you're the triune being that you are and he begins to talk about body spirit and soul and he talks about the the law of faith or doubt unbelief unbelief in the heart and then he talks about the nature of the spirit that there's five senses that control that in five senses in the body and now listen up brother branham words this he says then what does that do from the middle of the heart which is the soul now i put in parentheses those are my words spirit and that ebm stands for edited by me that's for me i just copied and pasted this quote for my notes reason why i did that is because if you go listen to greatest battle ever fall brother branham reverses this order of how he teaches it after the seals so he says which is there's from the middle of the heart from there goes forth feeding every channel the trouble of it is we're standing in here with a lot of doubt now i'll put this in parentheses you say doubt that just means i doubt the word no that means a lot more you're standing here the problem of it is you're standing here with a lot of doubt a lot of complexes could be a lot of fears could be a lot of hurt could be a lot of pain could be a lot of pressure trying to accept what's out there you've got to stop that and come down that channel with the true word of god and then it goes out itself automatically it's what notice it's what's on the inside that's the thing that counts is the inside satan's approach is from the inside he's not going to get me down in the bar stool he's not going to get me over here on the street corner buying dope you're not going to find me there so his approach rather than coming externally he comes internally and he works through complexes he works through bitterness he works through jealousy he works through fear he works through pressure and he says you're standing here with a lot of this he says you got to clean it out satan's approaches from the inside and there's only one avenue that can come down and that's by the way a free moral agency come into the soul which he's speaking of the spirit by your thoughts as a man thinketh in his heart so is he if you say to this mountain move and don't doubt in your heart but believe and what you have said will come to pass you can have what you said you get it you get it there you are see there's the battlegrounds if you'd only get that started first he's preaching the greatest battle ever fault and he's not preaching that you just need that you just need to be born again that's that's that's given that's assumed you're already born of the spirit of god and he says but what you've got to get started the reason why you're losing to the devil the reason why your wins and losses category is loss and loss and loss is because you've never cleaned out those channels inside of your spirit wow and he says here see what it's covered over with you say well now you say well these conscience and senses and so forth don't have anything to do with it brother branham certainly it does wow your conscience your memory your imagination your reasoning your affection i don't have nothing to do with it certainly it does but if you let the word come in and cover it over notice this cover it over with conscience i want you got to slow down here because you'll miss what the point brother brad was making he says that if you let the word come in i raised my hand say lord let it come in i accept it lord i believe it lord he says if you let the word come in and cover it over with conscience then it can't grow it'll be a deformed word so you accept it i believe it i accept it but then you let your memory come in and you let reasoning and doubt sit on top of it he says then it can't grow it'll be a deformed word good you see you see the battle this is why he's preaching the greatest battle ever fought is right here i've got my past to deal with god's forgiven me of but i still live with the baggage of yesterday of what happened to me of what took place in my life and brother adam says if you don't clean that out and let the lord come in there and clean it out and heal that part of you he says you you're out here you're wanting to accept the word i want to believe the word and he says but you're letting that sorrow or that pain or unforgiveness and you try to you try to meet that with the word he says it'll cover it over and it the word can't grow it'll be a deformed word you'll never have faith you want to have faith but you can't have faith you say brother matt what are those things they're not sin i'm not talking about sinful things we're not talking about things of the flesh i'm talking about things from your past that you won't let go of and then those become hindrances they don't become building blocks and stepping stones they become roadblocks and ditches and you get stuck in a rut and stuck in a ditch and you just remain there as a believer i want i believe the word i want all of it and we're preaching on being changed there's a part of you that's being changed but the devil if he can do anything will stun our growth and we'll come we'll we'll allow ourselves to be a believer but don't touch that part of me that that that hurt that happened to me was real and you hold on to that and if you're not careful you begin to pet that you begin to embrace that you realize what that is that's pride and listen friends we're all guilty all of us are guilty of it brother random says certainly it covered over with conscience it can't grow it'll be a deformed word did you ever see a good grain of corn planted in the ground and let a stick fall over it it'll grow crooked any vine anything that grows up will because something has hindered it he tells the same exact uh he gives the same exact example in another place and i don't have the quote here but he talks about how he's seen all this the wheat of the corn and he says and all of the stalks were just growing straight every single one of them just straight up to the sky and he says but i noticed there was one and he says it was bent over and it came out of the ground been at a 90 then it went back up and then it fell back over and then it he said it was up and he says see something when it was young something in other words it's it's past it's yesterday something took place something happened and he says then a branch or something fell over on top of it and brother branham says and it caused its life to grow up deformed and brother branham says and it will always grow crooked like that until you remove the branch now the miracle is is that it didn't die and satan intended to kill you and wipe you out by it but you're still here can i just stop and pause for a moment and say no matter what you've went through and no matter what you've been through when you were a teenager when you were 20 30 40 yesterday last week no matter what happened to you today let me just remind you you're looking for them for a miracle look around you you're here you're in church you're serving the lord you still have a desire for the lord you still want him you want your children saved you still want the holy ghost you still want good things from god you still want his blessings you still want to worship him you still want to serve him satan might have knocked you down but here you are you're back on your feet again [Applause] you're here with a desire and a hunger for the word of god you may not be what you want to be and you may be messed up here tonight but take courage in small victories that you're here on a wednesday night hearing the preaching of the word of god believing it accepting it casting down the lie of the devil say thank you god for even if it's just something as small as i came to church tonight that means i got my foot on the on the head of that devil that tried to prevent me he said if something that fell upon you a branch or something he said it'll grow crooked so he says notice these things now let me just go a little bit further and he says it must be accepted in the mind then it's believed with the heart then the word of god becomes a reality then every senses of the soul the speaking of the spirit and body is just scoured out with the holy spirit then your sense of god your conscience of god everything that's godly flows through you there's not a doubt anywhere there's nothing can rise up i say lord let me get to that place let me get to that place to where the holy ghost comes and scours out every part of me the parts that i can't clean out the parts that that self-help can't help the part that psychologists and doctors can't help but i know the healer he's the great physician and he can scour every part of you body spirit mind i desire that you prosper and be in health mentally physically spiritually emotionally it's not that you're not a believer it's that you've allowed something to fall upon you and you've got to remove the branch [Music] there's nothing can rise up i love that but if that channel has been cleared out and been purged and been filled on the inside with the holy spirit that don't come and now listen that don't even come in memory no matter about miss jones i don't know who miss jones is but i'm sure we all have a miss jones no matter what about miss jones what she did it's you and god well that preacher if you only knew brother it doesn't matter when god cleans out your memory and your conscience and he scrubs you clean it doesn't matter then it's not about miss jones anymore it's you and god together and nobody else but you too i say lord let me have a spiritual awareness and consciousness to where it's just us too [Music] how many wants that say lord let me live where it's just me and you it's not me and you and plus somebody else and plus my fear or my past or my complex or my baggage or my mistake or my failure or that accident let me just serve you and it's just me and you lord doubt's gone fear is gone memory's gone i can just serve you and have faith like a child how many can say that here tonight and say lord restore childlike faith again let me have faith in your word to where i hunger and thirst for it and it's not me it's not me and you and somebody else it's just me and the lord since you two together nobody else but you two there you are there's your battle kill him at the beginning stop him dead in his track i love this it ain't how long you can make the war linger it's stop it right now right now it ain't by how long i can drag this out it's available it's here liberty's here freedom is here right now can you say man what was the matter you had to open the channel first every one of the other channels is cleared out just like an old boiler with the flu stopped up you put a fire it'll blow your thing up that's what's the matter with so many blowed up christians christians that's what's the matter with so many blowed up born again filled with the baptism of the holy ghost the devil's trying to get him to lie to them and tell them you don't even know the lord you've never experienced god you don't have the holy ghost and that's not your problem the problem is is that you you never cleaned out the flu and then you lit a fire and brother adam says then it just blows up that's what's wrong with so many blown up christians it's because they don't clean the channels out they don't go down to the inside you've got to clean it conscience memory thoughts laying aside everything i lay aside everything lord and coming from the inside out with the with that unadulterated word of god that's the truth see it's your mind that opens up the door or closes the door and listens to your conscience listens to your memory listens to your affections but when your mind closes itself to these things and let god the spirit of his word come in it blows the rest of the stuff out every doubt is gone every fear is gone every sensation of doubt is gone every feeling is gone there's nothing standing there but the word of god and satan can't battle against that he can't battle against it he says there's the battle the very first front line let's not use a 22 rifle let's get an atomic bomb let's do the job right let's get god's atomic bomb what is it brother branham faith in his word that's god's atomic bomb it'll blow sickness it'll blow devils right and left it'll annihilate them oh it just destroys it disintegrates everything that's ungodly when that bomb of faith drops in there with the word of god behind it it blows every devil every sickness every disease i say god drop it right in my heart i open it up right now and say god dropped that atomic bomb to where my channels are so cleaned out i can have faith and accept what you say [Applause] how many can say lord i just want to have no hindrances i want to clear out every doubt every hindrance lord i want to be able to accept it you say is that right brother man on the same and not he says then why does it all the same as and why does it on the same and not others it's because of the channel then if satan has got just one more then if satan can get through there get by these conscience and all these other things that he gets right down here to the end of the soul and the spirit is speaking of in the mind now if he can just get you you'll never look at one of them until first you have to let him in here you have to let him in i know that's hard to read you have to let him in how does the devil get access brother man i've guarded him i read my bible i pray i talk to the lord how did he get in somewhere you opened the door and it may not be a door that what like a door what you're thinking maybe it wasn't lust a lustful demon or maybe it wasn't some kind of prideful thing but maybe just something in your spirit that you allowed to fester and you keep thinking that way brother branham gets to the end of and we we spoke on this and i didn't want to take the time to read it again i've we've read it so many times the lord gave me this message titled being changed from standing in the gap and brother branham talks about brother roy has the dream and brother adam says the brother roy says brother branham you were at the lord's table and he says you were you were seated at the lord's table and he says and he says and then something came in and snatched you and took you out of there and he says then i i seen you he says in that same light the light the pillar of fire that's in the picture he said that same light whirled in and it sat you at the head of the table and you were at the head of the table and brother branham says and he says but brother branham you were changed to look different you were changed to look different and brother branham says now i just he took out a little note and he writes in there being changed that's what he writes and he sticks it there he says i just want to lay that there to remember when i tell you the interpretation he says it was funny to brother roy it was odd to brother roy me being changed and he says but i want to write this down to show you at the end of this message i want to show you he says what the interpretation of that where brother branham was the he was the same man but he comes back in the room and he's changed and your mind goes when you read that oh it's got to be something about the the seals or something you know going to jeffersonville it had nothing to do with that it was a complex that brother branham had developed against people because he preached and they wouldn't hear his preaching they wouldn't line up brother adam says i'd preach to them and he says and then i developed such a complex he says such a indifference towards people such an attitude i call them rickies and raquetas and the lord showed me i ought not to do that those are many of them's or god's people he says but they're they're bound up by denominational teaching he said they would serve the lord if they only knew what to serve and so what's brother bro what's you say well i guess brother baron him all the way in sin and then the gap wasn't born again brother matt i guess all the way and standing in the gap he preaches the seals and now he now he's not even born of the spirit of god no no but he was more than he was he was a body spirit soul and he had ingested something in his spirit that had became so corrosive to him preaching the gospel preaching the word and it became so corrosive to him that he says could you look at a man blind going over a cliff and not say anything to him surely he said surely you couldn't do that if a blind man was about to go over a cliff and you wouldn't reach out he said now that brothers i just want to confess to you that's he said you'd have to be so indifferent in your heart and he says well that's how i was i was just about to do it and he goes through the entire message and standing in a gap and he tells how that and he says but that was the change that brother roy seen that brother branham looked different that something had been changed not that he was a compromiser not that he was going to compromise on the word not that he was going to even preach it any different but his heart his spirit his attitude his outlook on how he viewed the situation only god could have changed him it wasn't brother branham but a light had came in put him back in the room what was it god had done surgery on his heart glory because even after the message brother branham says he says now brothers i'm still that way i still feel that even after he confesses he says i still feel they ought to have listened he says now will you pray for me you brothers you in radio land you'd be praying for me he says until i can have that something in my heart to where there's not rickies and mercators he says that's god's people until that something in my heart can change i'll just loaf around preach some means that's what he says you know what's so incredible about that is brother way in that service at the end of that tape dies and then you go to you go to the end of that tape and here's brother way past passed away dead nurse was there checked his pulse was dead and brother branham goes and prays for him and if you listen to the prayer brother adam says oh god i pray that brother way would come back to himself now you take this for what it's worth but i think that god chose to allow a miracle like that to happen in that circumstance and on that tape and it's very representative of what had taken place in brother branham brother wade passes away and brother baron begins to pray for him when you hear on the tape by the way he's back breathing again he stays stand back sitting up and god raises a man from the dead in that sermon brother branham preaches the flashing red light of his coming that evening and he's he's really he's he's reminiscing trying to remember he's trying to make sense of what happened he says well i don't know if because at the end of that tape let me let me come back at the end of that before brother way passes before brother brother way dies in the in the in the in the in the church there brother branham says now he says you see how easy it is brother way he says you got a complex you know how easy it is to get a complex and he says i pray that god would give me that thing back that i lost in that complex that's how the random words that i pray that god would give me that thing did he lose the holy ghost no did he lose did he lose the lord no he didn't lose the lord but there was a part there was a channel there that had became clogged up with envy and anger and bitterness and temper that's what it was and brother branham says now brother way you know how it easy how easy it is to get a complex brother away brother brandon preaches flashing red light of his coming and he's trying to he's trying to make sense of what happened and he says no i don't know the poor brother maybe me saying that about him having a complex is just more than he can handle and there me being as how much respect he has for me and maybe he thought i was rebuking him and thought i was you know calling him out brother adam says i don't know he says i don't know or or or what it was he said but brother way pat passes away you know what it was it was god showing his prophet that the dead can still be raised and the gift can still operate and yet a channel in your spirit can be clogged and something in your life could be displeasing to the lord what is it you don't look to any external outward emotion or evidence or gift to preach or gift whatever it is you let the microscope of god's word and the the light of the holy spirit you say well i'm all right well as as david said try me o lord search me o god see if there be any wicked way in me see if there be anything any any part of me brother adam says see you'll never look at them until you have to let them in here you have to let him in then when he gets in he's got control then what does he do he begins to use the conscience he begins to use this begins to use this outlet what is it see see taste fill smell hear imaginations conscience memory reasoning affections he begin to use all those different little channels as long as he could get in above this one here he's got to come in your mind first and you have to accept it listen it can batter against you but it can't get to you until you accept it it can batter against you it can it can it can try to infiltrate you you say i'm going to get so healed and the lord's just going to give me such a deliverance that it doesn't even bother me anymore oh no you've missed it you've missed the point it can batter against you but you can resist you can cast down vain imaginations or any thought that exalts itself above this you say is that what i've got to do brother matt that's what the apostle paul tells you to do the weapons of your warfare are not carnal but they're spiritual they're mighty even to the tearing down of strongholds you say how do i how do i defeat the devil give him what jesus gave him the word and faith in his word would defeat the devil anytime anyplace anywhere under any circumstance you've got to accept it stand to your feet and bow your head with me close could you bow your heads musicians could you come hallelujah it can batter against you brother branham says but you've got to accept it you've got to give place to it the bible speaks in proverbs chapter 18 every head bowed ever i closed being changed as a chart part of you part of me that changes there's a part that's being changed and i just want to raise a hand i would invite you to do the same to say lord i want to be changed i want to be continually be changed lord changed in my lord if it's some complex some fear something the devil's tried to put upon me some kind of complex or grudge some wound or some hurt as the proverb says the spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity but a wounded spirit who can bear it says what happens to god's prophet becomes wounded in his spirit he says i wasn't one to kiss the babies and bury the dead and marry the young but god had called me to take a two-edged sword and battle against demonology he said somewhere i've been scarred i've been cut i've been hurt been cut many times deep maybe you're here tonight every head bowed ever i closed and you just want to raise a hand very simply and just say as david said search me o god let the light of your word shine and every crevice every every part every place of my heart of my spirit i want to be changed lord i want to be different as brother and brother roy sees brother branham says you looked different i want to look different lord i'm raising my hands here tonight to say lord i'm warring i'm in i'm in a i'm in a battle with myself and i'm not going to surrender it's a constant enemy prophet says your greatest enemy you got is the person looking you in the mirror and i'm here to say lord set me free set me free here tonight god you see the hands up everywhere every heart lord that's bowed every need lord that's behind those hands and those hearts maybe those online listening in healing lord comes from

person that's here lord grant it to me as i raise my hands with everybody here tonight asking you lord god as i just surrender right now surrender in your presence lord search me o god see if there be
