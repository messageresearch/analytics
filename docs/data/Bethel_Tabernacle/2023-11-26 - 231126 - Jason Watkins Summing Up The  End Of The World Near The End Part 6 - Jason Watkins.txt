the PowerPoint up and we were going to begin at slide 41 I believe amen first we'll get to Hebrews 12 and uh we'll start at Verse 18 for ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched and that burned with fire nor unto Blackness and darkness and Tempest and the sound of a trumpet and the voice of Words which voice they that heard entreated that the word should not be spoken to them anymore for they could not endure that which was commanded and if so much as a beast touched the mountain it shall be stoned and thrust through with the dart and so terrible was the sight that Moses said I exceedingly fear and Quake but ye are come unto Mount Zion amen and unto the city of the Living God the Heavenly Jerusalem and to an innumerable company of angels to the general assembly in the Church of the firstborn which are written in heaven and to God the judge of all and to the spirits of just men made perfect and to Jesus the mediator of the New Covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of Abel amen amen let's pray father we commit ourselves into your hands now this morning and uh pray that you will keep me even keeled and measured out this morning Lord I want to make some tracks into our lesson and so I pray you'll just keep my mind focused on the notes in front of me as I feel that this is what you have inspired me with Lord there's many things we could say that's always true but you you know you knew who would be here before the foundation of the world you knew who would be streaming you knew who would hear an archive Lord and so we want to surrender ourselves completely readily Lord and make ourselves our our mind and the gift that belongs to you available for your Usage Now sanctify our hearts and Minds Lord and focus our attention on the word we commit ourselves into your hands to this very end in Jesus name amen amen God bless you friends you can be seated praise the Lord now I'm going to just pick up these uh next two slides we got this one the next one and a part of the third one um on last Sunday and so I want to come back here to this again and let's let's pick up our reading straight away uh in this message Christ is the mystery of God revealed so I want you now and here here's a real point that I that I I I feel it on my heart I brother Jason was preaching uh on our midweek service before Thanksgiving and I was so Smitten by that sermon and one of the points that I just thought was profound was how that brother JD took that woman at the well and he showed how that you know she began and brother Brandon picks it up she Begins the conversation Jesus starts itoman bring me a drink she replies you know blah blah blah blah blah he replies back she replies back and then you know the the the conversation stays natural stays political you know you know here you know if you you know what are you doing ask asking me you know we're not of the same political persuasion and uh you know you you're you're you got a different ideology about God than us and you say in Jerusalem and we say here and you know and this well you know was dug by our fathers and are you greater than our fathers and the conversation just starts moving into spiritual Realms and and then he he says butom if you if you knew who you were talking to you would actually ask me for a drink and and if you knew who you were talking to all your political prohibitions would collapse all of your Social walls would come down all of your personality and your complexes if you only knew who you were talking to and you know friends I I I was so caught by that I I I hope that today when you come here into the house of God you realize who it is you're coming to hear from from you're not just coming to hear from a man uh you're coming to hear from the word of God and it's a word that's been not only revealed doctrinally but made alive uh in a people amen so that it's a living manifestation that that is one of the foremost realities of the word of God now listen to this statement I've made it before remember this is is the third iteration of God's word the very first one was in the Stars before this one was ever put together the second one was in the Pyramid of Enoch before this one was ever put together then the third one has been this one amen God never intended for it to stay in the Stars it was to come to the pyramid he never intended for it to stay in the pyramid he intended to put it in a book he never intended for for it to stay in a book it's moving to flesh and that's the purpose of the word that's why you're a Believer that's why you're here hear me is so that this word can become alive in you Jesus was not a Bible Jesus didn't even carry a Bible Jesus was a human version of the word and that's what the Holy Ghost is given for is to take the word that's been opened in our day and transform words on page and put it behind skin it's exactly why when brother brandham took the in the in the dream there of Junior Jackson and he took a crowbar and PRI the top of that mountain brother brandham had been standing there ex you know uh standing there at the mountain and he was explaining the writing on the outside see he he's teaching and and correlating the church ages and tying it all together but then he said I took something out of the air and pride the top off of and when he said when I looked it was white stone that had no writing in it but remember that in White Stone in the Book of Revelation there's a new name amen amen and so then we realize that when brother Brandon would say the word interpreted is a manifestation of the name of God now how does God interpret his word he brings it to pass amen so of course there wouldn't be any writing on the White Stone because it wasn't going to be this kind of writing it was going to be written behind skin the word interpreted would be a manifestation in our lives amen and so the second thing that brother JD it so so just gripped my heart and I thought about our our our senior youth I thought about our teenagers and and all the way down into the younger parts of the senior Youth and all the way up into the 20s somethings and you know I I I I felt such a a burden on my heart to to say to our senior youth you realize that like the woman at the well Jesus kept taking her forward in her understanding that was the real point being made that you know there there's a dialogue and there's a an exchange back and forth and every time she took the next step Jesus gave her a little more understanding and then she responded he gave her some more understanding until he finally got to the point where her understanding reached a thing where all of her sins of her life and all of her problems and all of her weaknesses fell aside her past was erased and she and she be and she now comes under a revelation of the word of God and all her sins are forgiven all her position she had been taken from the uttermost to the uttermost what had happened to her her Revelation had restored her to the position that God had seen of her before the foundation of the world and so the the the point of the of the message comes to take you forward as brother Jason said here he said like the woman you know we have to move forward in our understanding he quoted the scripture that the Holy Ghost Jesus said when he comes he'll lead you he's taking you somewhere he's not just coming into this building on a Sunday morning and just sitting down to chill out with you he's here to lead you somewhere you're supposed to leave here further than you were when you came here so you you don't just remember brother Jason said we're not just to stay without understanding you're to move forward in your understanding not just doctrines but in in the reality of the word living behind you your skin so it begs the question then I would ask the senior youth how many messages of God's prop Have you listened to in the last 30 days amen how many complete start to finish messages you know what I I should you know what I should be able to to to know about you you want you just want some advice from Brother Jason your your answer should be 20-some at least a tape a day will'll keep the devil away that's a bonf IED fact I have proven it you know it'll keep the devil away it'll put strength in your life it'll tell you who you are it'll tell you who the enemy is and how to beat him and I want to beat him and I want to see you beating I want to see Us Victorious see so you know make it make it a don't you know say well I I read some scriptures but the message of the hour came to give you understanding of the scriptures you're never going to have the overcoming power because you know without the message if you say you say well I but I've got my Bible Well that like brother Jason said you come to church and people think that real worship is just singing songs and raising our hands but brother brother JD points out everybody does that everybody goes to church and does that what what what is that that that hasn't had any real effect in their lives it's a nice momentary Sensational feeling but where's the real mileage that it gets where does it gain Traction in their lives and bring them forward do you realize that the devil has watered down he the devil has attacked every point of the restoration he attacked it once the apostles were gone off and of course the seed had to go into the ground we know that serve God's purpose just like the fall in the Garden of Eden had to happen serves God's purpose but God promised in Joel I will restore the years am everything that the enemy took from God's church it was going to be restored and so the devil started immediately let me just give you a little bit of Education the devil started immediately attacking the restored word yeah amen he started immediately attacking Luther's Revelation the just shall live by faith and and so he you know what what did that do well it it kind of taught people that they you know the devil he he he Luther was actually what what Luther was bringing would bring a new birth but when the Devil by the time the devil got done with it and all he had just got the people in their minds to where well I don't have to listen to Rome anymore I don't have to do pennants and carry rosary beads and pray to Mary that and and and by by the time you get to and I don't have to do the I don't have to lash myself and crawl on glass and I don't have to do all those things the just shall live by faith and by the time you get to to today the attack on Luther's message is just telling the people that all you have to do is just have a mental agreement with an an event 20 years ago of of the Lamb of God dying on the on the cross the Lamb of God did die on the cross but what and he did he did say and he rose what good does that do you if you don't receive his life that doesn't do you any good that's great for him that he rose but what about you have you risen with him I promise you you don't rise with him unless you die with him and then and then starts and so today it's just a watered down version of just make a decision and it's not much more of a decision than it's actually less of a decision than which car to buy cuz people actually have a preference on which vehicle they buy but there's no impact on their life and that and the impact of their preference causes them to go out and purchase the vehicle they want people look at the gospel and there's no impact on their life whatever the they just make a decision and start coming to a church put their name on a book and believe that they're I know that's hard for you to get your mind around because you're taught different and you've been raised different but trust me as one who's worked out there in the community and and moved all my life among people you would be astonished at what at the people who live the the most degraded lifestyle have the most potty mouth you ever imagine think and do the most outrageous horrible things and will look you in the eye with perfect confidence and sayoh I know I'm born again I know I'll be in heaven yeah well how why do you think that well because I I accept that Jesus Christ died on the cross for me okay that's good have you died with him what does that mean I joined a church well that's not what I asked you have you died with him and then you then Satan wasn't done attacking the the you see see what here's what they lose sight of is that Luther's Revelation came from above it was a supernatural thing that God partially opened a third seal under the man age and dropped a mystery down under a partially open third seal and a and a messenger caught it and ran with it and it was a message that would bring eternal life and that's the part they're missing then they started attacking sanctification and immediately began watering it down and you know today you know I mean my goodness by the time you reach today what what what is commonly called Christianity it's certainly in the western world is is is allow to use the Bible language their tables are full of vomit yeah amen and that's not a far stretch you can see it when you look at what they call Christianity it makes me feel feel like vomiting it is so vulgar and so ridiculous and so not have do you realize friends do you realize and I could take my my time today and I'm I'm completely off my subject it's just a fresh anointing on me do you realize that that that that sanctification in the Bible Sanctified lifestyle Holiness am do you realize and I could prove it to you today listen to me Holiness is second only to the in the Bible is second only that to that Jesus is the Lamb of God I could take you to scripture after scripture after scripture Old Testament in the gospels in the New Testament throughout the Book of Revelation Holiness unto the Lord I is is not just some lifestyle of dos and don'ts but you'll never make it that way it's a living experience that you you have and then the there's a living Force takes over your mind and you don't do the way things of the world you don't dress like the world you don't act like the world you don't talk like the world there's an alien force has taken over you I mean as a subject it's it's I would say off the top of my head sanctification and Holiness before God is second I would say the only thing I could even think of that would outpace it would be that Christ was the Lamb of God slain before the foundation of the world and came to save Sinners that Christ is the Lamb of God and is the Messiah and his God would probably be the only thing that would outpace it [Applause] amen so so you just remember that that that God you know has this for you I'm sorry I'm I can't escape it I don't know why listen to this I don't know why I'm caging on this today let me just give you a few you say why make such a big deal over this because it's such a big problem amen even in the ranks of the message of the hour amen Jesus says blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God those who are pure in their heart you're not going to tell me your your inside is pure if your outside is obscene you're not going to tell me your inside heart is pure if the clothing you wear are is vulgar and your conversation is is not wholesome Paul said having therefore in 2 Corinthians 7:1 having therefore these promises dearly beloved let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the Flesh and spirit perfecting Holiness in the fear of God Amen he says to the Roman Church in chapter 6 verse 22 but now being made free from sin and become servants to God ye have your fruit unto Holiness and the end everlasting life so I mean and I could go on and on and on I Holiness literally Holiness is one of the most established truths in the Bible after Jesus being the Lamb of God Amen then they attack the baptism of the Holy Ghost and we've been having we've had a lot of teaching on that recently trying to teach bethl Tabernacle the balance of it myself and the other team me Members Ministry team members to show you that we're not looking to I don't I don't drive in ditches I drive on the road I'm not interested in either ditch it doesn't even matter if I can I got a four-wheel drive truck I could I don't want to I want to drive in the middle of the road I wanted something smooth I want to be on a Highway to Heaven see so so it's we we're not chasing and and Satan has attacked that and he's trying because if let me tell you something friends if Satan can't hold you back and he tries hard to hold you back and you're going forward in the Lord and he can't hold you back you know what he'll do as a last itch effort he'll shove you over the cliff if he can't hold you he'll just give you a shove and you'll become a fanatic and go off the on the deep end it is unnecessary we have the balance of the the word of God we have a living Christ that can get down in your life and teach you how to live a daily life of overcoming and put real power inside your life amen that's why I'm preaching today I want to see real power in our lives hallelujah we're not here just to learn fancy Doctrine we're here to have power you're going to need power the world is wicked the world is evil the lid is torn from hell and demons are streaming throughout the Earth am the world is completely facing Annihilation and every sign points to it I don't want to get go down that line today I would definitely be here till tomorrow Lord's got a thought on my heart you know they they say this one you know he died by natural causes I want to preach a sermon called Life by natural causes say you mean Supernatural causes no actually I don't I mean that there's a supernatural action that will take place that will put the Life of Christ in you naturally it'll change your nature Hallelujah you won't have to be a fanatic you'll be a true blue Christian balanced in the word of God marching to Zion moving into higher Heights with Christ daily it'll set up a craving in your heart for the word of God the more you get the more you want so brother brandham this is the this is what our whole series is about it's Christ being revealed so so I I I want the especially the teenagers I want you to absorb what's being said the the old alike everybody absorb what's being said what is the purpose of the Gospel it's Christ being revealed and he is the word and when the word is revealed it expresses itself you get that it expresses itself th this is how I can tell where a person's Revelation level is by their expression of their life get around them listen to the conversation see what they do where they go what what they do how they live you know what happens in their home where are their priorities I can tell pretty quick where somebody's priority of the word is say where where ought it to be it ought to be first it ought to be the center Hub of your life on which everything else is attached to the gospel didn't come let me tell you something Jesus didn't pay such a great price for to be a gospel of convenience it's not about that Jesus isn't this this gospel I'm going to tell you something friends this gospel that you're believing to today is dripping with the blood of Martyrs it's you what what happened in Israel is is terrible and horrible Beyond description but that's been happening to God's elect family down through centuries it is shocking the depravity of what man can do to fellow men amen and history is replete with it my goodness but but but but I'm here to tell you that God comes to change our lives and he's not he's not a god of con venience you don't just fit him in see he's not a fit in he should be the the first brother brandom said don't make him second I can't even get started on my notes what's going on this is the holy spirit all over me brother brandham said don't make him second he doesn't want to be second he wants to be first would you agree with me today and say Lord I want you to be first in my life first everything else should come behind that your career your education your friendships your relationships your money your Recreation everything should come second to that we're almost home friends where the Rapture is soon oh my so he says it's Christ being revealed and he is the word and when the word is revealed it expresses itself that's God's purpose for Jesus Christ was to express himself to take his own laws and live by his laws fulfill his law by Death fulfill his law by death I think I'm on yeah and Christ God died in flesh in order to condemn sin in the flesh thank God because you couldn't save yourself if he hadn't did it you were headed to hell and no way to stop it Oh my he condemned sin in the flesh that he might bring to himself a glorious bride redeemed back that will believe only in the word of God and not swap it like Eve did for intellectual conceptions of man those watered down versions of justification and sanctification and what the real Holy Ghost is don't accept a watered down version Oh My the devil's not afraid of a watered down version that will only believe only in the word of God and not swap it like Eve did for intellectual conceptions of man you see it that's Christ's idea that's God's idea the new birth reveals this amen amen right there is is what Christianity is all about Jesus said here's where we got to last time Jesus said in Mark 16 these signs shall follow them that believe see so in into all the world all right and to every age casting out devils and speaking with tongues and all these great manifestations of gifts that would follow that they shall not they maybe they ought to they will all right so so we find then that that Redemption now I'm I'm going to try to go a little further you still with me I feel like I've already preached enough sermon you could go home but will you just hang out a while and let me carry on Redemption was a must we know that brother Brenham talks about how that we read it in in several parts ago in the series I don't want to go that far back but how that from Genesis chapter 1 his his family was to have dominion over everything and brother brandham said you know it's it goes all the way out to the Millennium and then he I didn't show it to you last time not going to do it again today but he drops right down and picks up 1 Corinthians 12 and even talks about all the gifts and how that we're to have a dominion over that stuff we're not we're not to be out of balance with it we're to have dominion we're to have balance we're to have correct understanding you're to have dominion in your home listen this this goes from the garden all the way to the Millennium where it says have dominion over the fish of the Sea and the fowls of the air and over every living thing that creepeth upon the Earth so brother R says it goes all the way to all the way to the to the to the Millennium so Redemption then of course is a must and that's always been uh part of the Great purpose of God now we've shown you how that in the Garden of Eden it wasn't time brother brandham said they weren't even able to partake of the Tree of Life directly because it hadn't become flesh yet because Redemption had to work out you understand there had to be a fall and then they couldn't partake of it before the fall directly because it hadn't been flesh yet and then they couldn't partake of it directly after the fall because they got chased out you understand so so what is so then how do we get there oh I'm so glad you asked me that how we get there is God comes down into this world and brings a revelation of his word Bit by Bit by Bit And as you eat upon that you're redeemed and you're rebuilt oh my that's what our whole rebuilding Eden series was all about he's rebuilding us back to our original image see and so so it had to become flesh verse but just know this that from Abel's offering forward Dominion is underway it's being restored full Dominion is underway for God's family so brother brandom goes on so it's Christ expressing himself in the individual whether he's intellectual or whether he don't know his ABCs amen doesn't matter right he his that that's a that's a completely irrelevant point to him some people are Highly Educated some people are not as as as old Jerry used to say son young man I can see that you are educated far above and beyond your level of intelligence and some people are like that I'm just here to tell you it doesn't matter to God he's not coming here to educate you brother brandom said he says it like this Heaven won't have any kind of education civilization he turns right around and says it'll be an education so far above this one this one won't even be thought of see so it's Christ expressing himself in the individual whether he's intellectual or whether he don't know his ABCs the new birth is Christ is a revelation God has revealed to you this great mystery and that's a new birth see so I know I can tell whether or not I can tell where your level of revelation is by observing whether the word is expressing itself through you where it should be amen am see and if it's not and sadly I find too often that it's not in too many cases too many cases right here in Beth Tabernacle now granted to any real Pastor any real Shepherd even One cases too many all right so I I don't want you to think it's all doom and gloom I appreciate the the fervor that I see in the Saints of bethl Tabernacle but even one is too much for me I want to see us all full of the fire of the Holy Spirit I want to see you take every Spirit under your control for the glory of God I want to see a token applied in our homes and our young people full of the Holy Spirit I want to see when we walk down the street Satan hows and faints at our presence so so the new birth then is more than an a a mental understanding and it's more than a a mental agreement with doctrinal teaching it's a lifechanging revelation that brings forth the expression of Christ as we've been reading it brings forth the expression of Christ from the heart out amen from the see lot a lot of the reason people can't maintain sanctification like they need to when they don't have that full experience that brings the new birth is because that's outside in and you're you're trying to you're trying to force a a a a legal quot a legal coat a legal cloak onto me and make me look right and dress right and think right and talk right and and do things right but after a while this this guy right here gets sick of that and he just starts jerking it off but and he and he won't wear it anymore that we're not after that we're after changing the inside outward Hallelujah then the then the thing that that the that wearies you and makes you upset is when the flesh doesn't obey the word of God there's no weariness Jesus said take my yoke upon you for my yoke is easy and my burden is light everybody who's Born Again of the spirit of God Can Say Amen to that it's the greatest thing it's every desire of my heart there's no trouble in being a Christian I only get upset when I fail at being a Christian there's no wearing me me out long term that eventually someday I'll just backslide and go away from it I this is from the inside out that's right see so this is this is the gene of God that has come to life and is taking over your life the evidence I mean the evidence of a true and I'm going to read you a scripture that I don't have up here but I'm just going to read it to you I'm actually not read it all but I'm just going to make some points to it want to say this the evidence of True Life altering Revelation if you ever want to see where it's laid out perfectly in the Bible almost like a beautiful garden you could go see then just find yourself in Acts chapter 2 you say oh yeah verse 38 be baptized name of but no not 38 go to 41 and read through 47 because 41 and 47 is going to let you know why they obeyed acts 238 why did they do that because they heard a gospel preacher preaching and it pricked their hearts and they knew that in spite of all of their devout Judaism and these these were devout men these weren't gamblers and carousers these were devout Jews who lived holy lives before Jehovah but when they heard the gospel that I'm preaching today when they heard about the Holy Ghost that I'm preaching today they they knew inside their hearts that they were missing that element all they had was an outside observance but it caused them to taste of the good word of God and they wanted more and said Peter what must we do and he said you got to repent you got to change your whole thinking you got to accept the word of this hour and the Bible says in verse 41-47 then they that gladly received his word were baptized that's why they obeyed acts 238 they did it gladly no one convicted them into it that's right no one threatened them or scared them into it that's worthless no one you know told him sad stories about how there you know your I'm a pray for you and boohoo and get them down to an altar and as soon as they get away from that they go right back there's no there's no effective change but but these men had something in their hearts and they gladly received his word but you know what that tells me that tells me that in all of their righteous ritual they had no joy they had no real joy in the Lord and that's what I want and I want it for me and I want it for you a joy in the Lord is my strength they that gladly received his word and then look at what happened in verse 42 and they continued steadfastly in the apostles Doctrine so they didn't stop and say well I just believe Jesus at Calvary I don't I don't Peter James I like you guys you're pretty cool but I don't really need what you got to say I just want Jesus at Calvary they con the ones who were born again by the spirit and were baptized in his name and received the Holy Ghost continued steadfastly all the time every day every day all the time moving forward moving forward move forward church because one of these days you're going to be like Enoch and move into a new world hallelujah hallelujah and godly fear it's what the Greek word means Godly respect and reverence fear Came Upon Every Soul verse 46 they continued daily with one Accord verse 47 praising God and the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved as long as the Lord was adding it everything stayed fine soon as they started soon as the church started allowing people to come in and call themselves a Christian when they weren't really that's when problems started amen so brother brandham goes on you good all right I'm gonna watch my time because y'all know how terrible I am at keeping the throttle down so I'm just going to cut my time to a normal amen now what are you going to do when you get all that group together what what what what group The One ones that are expressing God the ones that have the expression of the word see what are you going to do when you get all that group together where the Revelation is perfectly in Harmony and God is expressing it through his word by the same actions the same things that he did making the word manifest oh if the church only knew its position it will one day then the Rapture will go when it knows what it is am amen when it knows what it is I'm gonna invent a word today I tried every possibility in The King's English to to conceptualize what I want to say to you and I and believe it or not I'm I'm having to invent a word because I read a bunch of quotes from a Kentucky hillbilly and this is as close as I can come up with I'm I'm I let me let me let me I'm gonna I'm GNA take this word human you have been human if you had never if you were born and raised in a bubble and never known another person in your life you've never been human but because we hang around humans you're human see well then why don't you just use the word humanized because that would convey the not what I'm trying to gonna go to right now I'm just going to let brother brandham say it all right so you don't have to worry about believing me did you notice Paul never knew Jesus physically Paul never knew him the only way that Paul knew him was by Revelation by a vision is that right here's your chance is that right Paul only knew Jesus by the Revelation and then he says just like Peter did say wait a minute I thought Peter knew him In the Flesh the point brother Brandon is going to make is that Peter did know him in the flesh but but we find that Peter had a real experience because knowing him in the flesh he denied him in the garden knowing him in the flesh he tried to stop him from Calvary knowing him in the flesh he denied him three times in pilate's judgment Hall yes sir amen knowing him in the flesh after Jesus left Paul Peter to said I just go fishing he didn't even he didn't he didn't even know what to do he just went back to his old his old haunts yeah see there's been no Peter when you're converted feed my sheep so Peter eventually the B they they they go on to say concerning Christ that we knew him in the flesh but henceforth said the Apostle know we him no longer we knew him in the flesh but now we know him by the flesh no longer we know him in a greater way than when we knew him in the flesh all right right so he says Peter had seen him in flesh but he didn't know him by flesh because Jesus said so Flesh and Blood didn't reveal it to you even my own life didn't reveal it to you but my Father which is in heaven has revealed it to you do you see why loving me as your pastor cannot give you eternal life the not a person in this building that I don't fully know loves me with a great love and if I could save you I would if I could give you eternal life I would amen that if I could do the greatest thing for you I'd give you eternal life the problem is it's not mine to give but what I can do is lead you to eternal life I can take you there if you'll come along with me and get you eternal life see so so so he says here see even even my own life didn't reveal it to you but my Father which is in heaven has revealed the thing the things to you that he is the word of God and Upon This Rock I'll build my church Peter didn't know him by flesh man walked and handled him and everything else John says that we handled him we handled the Word of Life see all of them had had had a a a flesh experience with Jesus of Nazareth but not Paul all right you still with me Paul had something greater than any of the Apostles did wait a minute I thought th this breaks the rules of adding and subtracting you just said the apostles had something Peter that that the apostles had something Paul didn't have so now he should have less than they got but now brother brandham is saying no because he had less he had more you see what's happening they said well I've got more of a revelation than you Paul because you know I walked with him I went fishing with him one day I heard him talk he sat in a boat with me and actually told me let's go over here and fish in this place and we'll get more fish and we did it see see we seen him do things but Paul saw him after he was dead buried rose again and expressed himself in the pillar of fire that led the children of Israel amen see isn't that amazing and so he says but the only way you're saved is by know him by Revelation amen amen so so knowing him in the flesh didn't save any of the disciples they had not even even Peter and James and John and all of them as as gallon as great a men as they were and we couldn't hold a light to them today but they had to have a revelation an experience and it had to exceed Matthew 16 Peter understood the identity of Jesus in Matthew 16 but after he was converted he had even a greater understanding see so what do you mean then brother Jason by the disciples were human whereas Paul wasn't human Paul had a less encumbered understanding because he hadn't been Human by living with Jesus in his Humanity now did I did I just read it to you y'all don't go into vapor loock on me I just read brother brand is saying this see because remember that to try to correlate Everything Jesus said if you hung out with him I mean John said goodness even if if I wrote everything he said the the world couldn't even contain the books so imagine trying to correlate all that you heard him say and living with him for three and a half years if if for no other reason then that's a lot you you got a lot more to focus that Paul didn't have to get focused Because by the by the time now listen friends God I'm G to say it to you God designed that Paul would avoid that Paul would avoid that God could could have easily let Paul meet him in the flesh Paul could have Paul's Paul's Mentor knew about Jesus galio he had stood there and and in the trial at at the Sanhedrin Paul Paul Paul never saw him never met him nothing there there's no no record anywhere and and and but we find that God could have easily done that and God didn't do that God uh elected that Paul would avoid that kind of interaction with Jesus when Paul meets Jesus he's already turned back to the pillar of fire that led Moses and the children of Israel amen the same one who created the whole world that's why Paul called him Lord capital L O R D he Paul knew brother bam said he knew better than to call that Pillar of Fire anything else he knew that he already knew what John had written in the beginning was the word and it was with God and it was God he already knew that was the same Pillar of Fire that led Moses see now that encourages me you know because I encourages me to be a part of the generation that that didn't get the privilege of going hunting and fishing with brother brandham amen not saying that wasn't a great privilege I'm just saying I didn't get I I I I you know I but but let me say it like this you know and I'm I'm not I'm not I don't want to use the word hindered I'm using the word human so it it does encourage me that I didn't get the privilege of going fishing and hunting with him but brother Brandon come backing to coming back to our quote the only way you're saved is by know him by a revelation so that's why I'm not using hindered that's why uh one because one wouldn't be hindered to have such a privilege I'm not saying that the disciples got hindered I'm just saying they got human I'm not saying that those who hunted and fished with William brandham were hindered I'm just saying they got human and but but I'm here to tell you listen friends so so this is exact listen this is exactly this is exactly why that that we both play tapes constantly but also exactly why we don't play tapes only for that very reason that's why we play them constantly but that's also why we don't play them only oh Hallelujah got a living experience with the god of Elijah I've met the same Pillar of Fire that would came on the platform with him see you see here here here's the point I'm really trying to make you remember my text from last Sunday God we were in Hebrews one God who in Sundre times back in the past Paul's breaking it down he's showing you remember I said last week I'm trying to take you and show you the the the forward progress he said God in sunnd times he spoke to the to his people through the prophets and then in the days of Jesus Earthly Ministry he spoke to them in his human flesh oh my but today by the Holy Ghost he's now speaking in his body he's still speaking he spoke in sundary times through Old Testament prophets he spoke in Jesus and now he's speaking in a bride in the last day in your life is a voice of the Resurrection hallelujah oh my that's what the devil fears it still has the same Authority it still has the same power it still has the everything that it's ever had it has only now even in a greater way cuz now the Old Testament prophets couldn't have the new birth you have by the Holy Ghost it wasn't yet given and even even Jesus Jesus was one man walking the shores of Galilee going about doing good but he said except according if we die it won't do you any good it'll biteth alone but if it die it'll come back in a many membered body and that's the whole reason I'm going to Calvary amen so I for one am glad to notify you that he is a living experience I'm glad today to notify you that he's not just mere Doctrine he's not just mere teaching and that oh friend you have no you if you could only absorb if you could only absorb the real value in just that that he's not just doctrinal teaching he's a living experience and that's important because we have a very human life and we must deal with real realities that that can't just be always explained in spiritual terms or rousing sermons we Face a very real world and a very Wicked World and a very real and wicked devil and demons are not impressed with message Doctrine they're not impressed with message cliches they're not impressed they're not afraid of that at all the word listen the word of This Day offers you a living reality and that's what the devil is afraid of I need to know how to leave my home as a Christian go into town in Satan's Eden and come home the same Christian that's I need to be able to go on the job I need to be able to operate my vehicle I need to be able to be on my laptop a Christian and when I close the lid I'm still a Christian hallelujah hallelujah oh my friends the answer is Not Mere mechanic or or it's not even just Supernatural happenings in the life and Ministry of of God's great prophet it's more than that listen in Joshua 6 it was the people who had to March around Jericho it was the people who had to who had to shout on the seventh day it was the people when the walls came down and every man just took off right in front of him and conquered whatever was standing in front of him they wouldn't have been able to do that with just a story from Joshua they had to get involved it's hearing recognizing and acting upon the word of God hallelujah see after hearing and recognizing I want to make a point to you before I close I'll make this my last one you good after hearing and recognizing the real strength is in acting that's good on the word yes sir see going to say that again it's not that there's not a strength in hearing there the Bible says there's a blessing in just reading the Bible there's even a blessing in just hearing it read so it's not that hearing there's not a blessing and recognizing wow that's really valuable that'll put some real some real strength in you to recognize cuz when you recognize the word you realize God is speaking directly to you but it's acting on the word is where real strength develops you say brother Jason that's that's counterintuitive because I need strength to act on the word what you need is to exercise your faith exercise your faith and build your strength you remember the Lord chastised Brother Bram and standing in the Gap the Lord chastised brother brandham for always having to move him to everything and the Lord chastised him for that lord said why do I always have to move you to everything and you know and the Lord said to brother brandham where is your reward you mean I got a reward yeah this is a partnership this a family affair you're how about you be a joint air with Christ how about you be a partaker we are partakers that means you're a partaker I'm a partaker I'm a joint Heir with Christ amen so so brother brandham you know the the the problem was that that you know he he because he he was so uh he let people complexing and he didn't want to he didn't want to have a critic that could say a word amen and he and then he and he come a challenge right after the seals and his heart was smashed because here he was the greatest thing of his whole entire Ministry those seals said it was every bit thus sayith the Lord the greatest thing and he didn't top that till he got to the token and then that was even another level and so when brother brandham is now he's come to the climax he's come to the opening of the seals the greatest event to the Christian church in 2,000 years since the word had got sealed up under Seven Seals and you would think that that would have won the day but it actually pushed him further into further into rejection because before you know he stood between them a nice guy you know between the trinitarians and the Oneness and brothers were brothers and let's be brothers and doesn't matter what church you go to and let's just all be one for all and you know he's a very nice man and very kind-hearted and very humble and even his critics gave up that that he was a very Christian humble Christian man nothing nothing to say against his life at all no no way to bring a charge against him here's a man who went 33 years of ministry and there never was anyone who ever rose up who knew him who lived around him who heard him preach who followed him around the world no one even his critics ever brought a single railing accusation against his character not one not one in 33 years never even brought into question he was always considered a humble Lord got even the ones who disagreed with his Doctrine and thought that he got serpent seed some old man out of the Wilderness must have come and told him that even the ones who disagreed with his Doctrine and thought he was a false prophet none of them accused him of of of a an illicit life or lying or deceitfulness see so you can understand then my disdain for the people who try to come more than half a century later and try to bring that charge that is stupid at the highest level so and I don't want to get off on that today but I just want you to know something friends you can be proud of this messenger that God sent to us amen they could find no no charge against him but but but and and even brother Brandon could stand there in June of 63 and after after almost 30 years of ministry say there's never been a a mistake in the ministry and he said around the world and he challenged them from International pull pits not in a closet somewhere from International pull pits challenged anyone to come forward if they ever knew of anything that was said thus sayith the lord of the thousands of times there was ever an error in it no one no one around the world but but don't think the devil don't know how to use that against you and when he brought the opening of the seals then we find that because the world didn't suddenly all become Believers it affected him he was a human being it gave him a complex and that's what standing in the Gap is all about God coming to him and saying why do I always have to drive you to everything why do I always got to move you where's your reward where's the exercise of your faith and brother brand said because I I just didn't ever want to make a mistake and I didn't what what he was really confessing was his complex didn't want to give a Critic something and because of that Satan had complexed him and now he said I let the sick lay sick and I'm waiting on a vision why did I do that he said he said from this hour he said I'm going to go forward he said whether I know I've got the word of the Lord or not I'm going to believe by faith you understand God needed him stronger than he was he couldn't be of service broke down in a complex and God said you got to exercise your faith where's your reward in it go forward but what if I make a mistake God is in control of it all brother said even sometimes in the Bible this is the scripture is is filled with examples where God allowed his servants to make a mistake and then God turned around the devil and took the victory right took took the victory right away from the devil and made it a glorious thing for God's family I am I am encouraged by the failures of Samson because he won in the end I'm encouraged by the failures of David because it didn't stop the promise and God still put a man on his throne and nothing David did in his failure could stop it and there's nothing I can do or you can do to break down the promise of God hallelujah no wonder friends we don't want just to have a Doctrine want to have a living experience is that what you want today a living experience you've got a great reward exercise your faith don't wait for it to fall on your head don't wait fory dust exercise go forward have faith believe God God wants a a a church of Warriors he wants a Church of Champions he wants a church of people with courage he wants to see young people filled up with his life he wants to see married home married couples strong in the Lord wants to see our homes vibrant with the word of God that comes right down into the church you want a spiritual church you want a spiritual church a church is just a collection of families if you want a spiritual church you're going to have to have spiritual families if you're G to have spiritual families that's going to have to start with spiritual daddies spiritual husbands spiritual teenage young men Paul said I write unto you young men because you're strong hallelujah hallelujah oh I feel like preaching right now and I got to quit I'm gonna make myself worse but oh friends I'm so thrilled with the word of God to think what a what a contrast the true word is to the world we live in where men are just just sissified jellyfish no Scruples morals or courage I tell you God wants men who are rugged men who will take a stand on the word of God men who will set an example of prayer and pety in their home and give their wife something to follow Hallelujah let's stand friends God
