to have that more often than on father's day i mean i'm glad she did it for father's day but amen remember as brother luther was saying every day is really father's day because we i have a father i'm so glad to have you all here today we want to turn to a our missionary report but the george has been preparing we've had it planned for weeks and weeks we're waiting for the special meetings to be over and so i consider this just another special meeting today man we've got some visitors here with us we greet you in the name of the lord happy to have you all here amen god bless you brother kevin is that you wow praise the lord god bless you buddy good to see you amen and uh friends from all over my goodness i'd start naming names i'm going to forget somebody or call this person that person i'm bad for that amen so we want to have brother george come and uh come on ahead brother george and then we also have a special announcement brother matt's going to make for us and so and then we're going to get to the most important part amen praise the lord praise the lord so many visitors god bless you we're happy to see you here today amen george god bless you no preaching you mind praying with me let's pray dear lord jesus i stand humbly before you lord just honored to be able to share the works of your hand your mighty hand with the people today lord and lord to a man that we talk to that's doing the missionary work lord they every one of them give you the honor and glory and they're just honored and humbled in your presence to be doing your work so as we share these updates lord we just pray that you get the glory and honor in jesus wonderful name amen all right so a lot has been going on let me make sure this thing is on there we go and uh here recently uh as you all know brother jason demars does a lot of work in turkey and means contacts with people there even though hasn't been able to visit there much but a need came to our attention through brother jason to mars first first let me pause and say you know sometimes when we give donations or support missions we sometimes don't get immediate reports or results we don't see the the impact that those donations or those sacrifices had but i believe that god's saving those for a special time when we'll see them all and he'll reveal those things to us so there's much more coming that we'll understand the half has never yet been told right but here we have an example where we're able to see some instant feedback and a need was brought to our attention through brother jason demars and brother petros while visiting in turkey discover that many of the refugees there use that thank you that'd be better that many of the refugees there were um struggling they they're the the believers are working in businesses that have been shut down or laid off refugees and the government insurance was cancelled and many were without basic food supplies so a lot were struggling and there was a call for help to feed 10 families in particular and praise the lord we were we were able to respond to that brother jason brought it to the the mission team's attention and within minutes we we'd agreed and said you know this is a need that we're going to support just instantly and sent the money right away and we did this through brother omed brother moe means pastoring a small group in caesarea and uh and so brother jason sent the funds to him and immediately he went to work i mean within days delivering food supplies to these families in great need now think about this you know you think it's just 10 people but these people were suffering crying out to the lord and god answered and through your donations and continued giving we were in a position to be able to immediately respond to that and we take no credit give all the glory to god and so here's some pictures of the massive amounts of food that were bought and delivered to these people now the believers themselves given their situation didn't want to be photographed themselves so brother umid shared with us what the food supplies and just different families and that we were able to help and this was from brother o'mead one brother who fell from a height at his work and place was injured and couldn't go to work his boss wouldn't help him he had to spend much money to get his leg fixed in the hospital and then brother o'mead said i appreciate your efforts very much may god bless you all today was one of my very best days when i saw the happiness in believer's eyes so you continue with your mission support and giving so when opportunities like this come up we can we can support them now the other bit part of our another part of it not the only other but another part of our mission support is for supporting for print needs we've shared with you before that there is still a great need for printed material and that is the best way to get material into the hands of the far reaches the jungles in africa primarily is where a lot of this is focused in central america as well so here is through brother berry and in a program that he started there for distributing the print material there's a project that's identified a need it's verified that there are brothers on the other end that are willing and able to take those printed materials and get them distributed and then these individual programs are put together and they're funded by churches like us and other donations and it all works together just a you know beautiful harmony the way it every one of these projects this comes together and uh brother barry says you know he doesn't do much it's it's all it's just amazing the way all these things come together and happen and so here's a list of all the printing material that's going out these are the projects that are in play right now and the church age books being printed in french and spanish and chuchua and malawi we'll talk about that a little more in particular and portuguese and you know all these projects are being funded and there's brothers on the other end to help deliver um so this is just a tremendous work that's going on and i wanted to share with you a little bit about some of that one need that in particular was brought forward that you know brother jason and i both immediately said this is something we should support and so we did we've made a commitment to support that and through your generous donations we are this is for malawi this is the one a project that we are we're supporting monthly yes a monthly contribution going to support this need and so you know you can read what's on the screen but the gist of it is that there was um a need for printed material there's a move for the tablets and and you know the agape tablets and they are wonderful for the people that can get them and can use them but it doesn't meet everybody's needs and then there are some there's some pressures i say this lately that there are people that take advantage of the fact that they have these in their possession and they use it to their advantage and to convince churches that if they only they can only play the tapes and not preach the message then they'll support them and so they're that we know that that's not a great spirit of the lord so there was a move i'll move to the i guess it's all there so anyway the malawi people this was happening there and they wanted to come against that and they the brothers moved to get print material in the hands of ministers that could then go out and share that with the people and meet them face to face preach the word hand them the material that they're longing for and so here's um i just drew a circle around malawi but there's other work going on in tanzania zimbabwe and zambia in those areas of of africa eastern africa western africa now eastern africa sorry so that's happening and this is why look at this picture and i don't know right away my eyes went to the condition of that bible but this look at that that's probably the only bible in the village and they shared it and looked at and use it and so this is why you know this is done and then as i mentioned there's a a great effort that goes into delivering these messages in sermons this is a country in south america that we're not allowed to name but these brothers have message books loaded in their saddle bags and they're going out into the countryside to deliver these um so again it's you know the once the material is printed then the real work begins right here is a video of a brother in africa and what he has to go through to get and deliver this material so i just wanted to show this real quick [Music] that wasn't me we are now crossing or messages [Applause] and here's another brother delivering in his vehicle is it goes on you'll get the idea paul don't push play yet but you get the idea they're going through great lengths these brothers to deliver this printed material and the thing about printed material is it stays right it's it gets passed around it gets shared and but imagine if you will you know it's hard for me hard for us as americans to imagine this but imagine that you get introduced to this message you learn that there was a prophet a god a man sent from god to to set all things in order for this day and age and you only get bits and pieces you don't have any of his messages in your language you don't even have a bible to reference it to so imagine the joy and exuberation that these people get there's something that struck their heart and awakened something deep within them like we all have and yet they don't have access to this stuff to the material so think about that when you see some of these reactions here's a brother who's a minister i want to thank god for receiving this bible i am a minister of the message i i've been ministering but using a paper on the phone and my phone broke down i've been missing without without the bible today i am a happy man because i have this bible in hand it will help me to reach some remote areas where i will need to minister to other people thank you for this gift amen don't don't push play yet so here's an entire church a congregation and very striking to me listen to what they're singing it just pricks my heart [Music] because of your contributions [Music] come on or um this is what brother jason talked about the book of acts church you know this is what we we're about listen to that sunday school if you didn't um we'll take a time we'll just skip through some of these some more pictures um pictures of some of the people receiving their printed material and it's just you know you see their church behind them their their grass huts and where the how they live and you can understand why they need print material it here's some pictures of some of the books being delivered being delivered um amazing and it all comes together like a great symphony just it works and i wanted to end with just one other thing today and we'll probably have another follow-up again not too long a part two but it's been on my heart and brother michael and others have confirmed it and you know we want to do more with local outreach and brother jason's sunday school today wow that really hit home um and gone to the hedges and highways and and so it's it's been our heart to do something more with the local youth and and figure out a way to get them involved and and just what that would be i don't know what that is or what it would be i just know it's been on people's hearts so we're asking you to pray for us pray with us and especially for a need that has been on sister jean's heart for many many years and so i'm gonna you know closer to home what can we do as missionaries closer to home and um sister jeans burden has been for the cherokee people and uh sister andrea and i had the privilege to be going that way and i shared that with sister jean and she arranged a meeting with us with this laney who had responded to an article that sister jean had posted and wanting material and sister jean started corresponding with her so we were able to actually meet with her in person and meet her family and just have a a conversation with them and shared with her about you know sister jean's desire and you know we just the door was opened where that's going i don't know but i'm just saying please continue to pray that's been a burden on sister jean's heart for many years so maybe a door will open and let's pray that it does and there'll be a local opportunity for us to do something so that's it for today thank you thank you brother it's exciting isn't it amen thank you brother george hey man and god bless you you can just hold the music for one moment we have an exciting announcement we wanted to make today and so i'll just make a a couple general announcements and then we have a video that we'd like to display for you this hasn't went live anywhere yet except for just a few local people um that have seen it and so it's actually it's actually premiered on youtube i think premiere just a little bit ago but we have a uh we had an awesome time at the youth meetings that we had how many enjoyed those that was just wonderful i believe we're still reaping the um the benefits from those services and the way that the lord moved upon brother john andy's heart it was just supernatural and so many testimonies that we're still hearing and some of the ones that we've received through email through text and then those that we've witnessed here in our own kids lives has just been awesome so we announced that we wanted to do a little bit more we had initially um had it upon our heart some number of months before that with some ideas about actually having a youth camp and so today that is a reality it's going to be a reality this year and so uh we have um we have a video we want to play i'll give you some of the details while they're getting that ready um it's going to be october 28th through the 31st so that'll be halloween uh weekend and so we're always believers are always looking for something to do amen and so we're gonna we're gonna worship the lord on that weekend the location is in greenville it's in travelers rest you're gonna see it here in a moment travelers rest south carolina right above greenville in the mountains not way up in the mountains but in the mountains a little bit we've already looked at the the weather and the weather is going to be beautiful the capacity is um at the campground so why don't we just go ahead and play that and then um if you if you could uh hit the lights brother ken there if you could that would be great and go ahead and play that video guys [Music] each generation has its own revival a chance at the word [Music] satan's intent is to destroy the young people but brother john has seen a spiritual death and a death grip even message churches and he he puts a choke hold on the young people on the children [Music] then that word comes and it starts molding us it starts changing us i look for character amen that's what i look for in the bride of jesus christ not your character but his character to see christ's life in us amen but that's why we have meetings like this that the holy spirit would come bethel tabernacle invites you for your chance at revival come and join us to hear the word of god preached in power along with plenty of

now in jesus name we commit ourselves to you in jesus name amen god bless you friends first corinthians chapter 3 amen so all in all we only managed to run maybe about 15 minutes a little longer um usually sundays run at least 40 or 45 minutes before i get going so we won't be into bad shape amen i've got a lot of material but you know how i'll do i won't press it if uh if it gets too long because i i don't like to work for nothing and i don't like to sponge you you know to where your minds are so tired that you don't get what we'll be saying okay we'll be sending out the registration link to the whole church do not share it it's not to be shared until the 28th this is your chance bethel tabernacle to register once it goes live we have no control to get you in the camp so take this opportunity to get registered before the 28th please don't make brother jason come up you know sometime at the 28th and some of our own young people haven't registered yet amen don't make brother jason get on you amen so because i will amen we're putting a lot of effort into this and we want to see you involved we're doing it for your benefit and uh we're coming alongside the parents and so we expect parental uh involvement as well and my goodness we had a ton of that in our last meeting so successful by far and away running away the the best series of youth uh meetings we've ever had and we've had we've had 30-day youth revivals here we've ran 10-day youth revivals before and uh but uh that was back in the day remember that kate you and she she i remember she was sitting there in our big circle and she said wow i've been in church for 30 straight days and we were all like yeah we have and so that was way back in the day and we had brother keith brown brother ronan spencer and brother eugene come through during that time and then we ran a 10 day but that i tell you those three days that we just had were spectacular and fantastico and so i i just was so pleased with how it went and uh probably in at the top of the list of any meetings we've ever had period and we've had some some hum dingers as they say amen remember brother fred when he came here we couldn't get nobody to go home till two in the morning amen and uh everybody wanted a microphone and and we had brother craig bower and and brother oh my we've had the brother uh uh wayne and different ones that have been here and brother donnie and brother tim and my we've had so many fantastic i tell you something friends you've been fed a high high high caliber diet amen so we ought to be in the millennium by now amen so uh we're thankful for what the lord has done and we sure appreciate again all the help that we got it it was it's incalculable and measurable and invaluable so we we have a few more months to do it again and uh and so we we do need the whole team has said we need to proselyte about another four brother doug's somehow if we can get another four brother doug's we'll pull it off so that was the team consensus unanimous amen brother doug so you either gotta become four people or hey man we gotta find four more like you so but it was a truly a team-wide group wide effort and everybody had such a phenomenal part we had uh i didn't get to go but uh i understand they had a nice time friday night uh their michael and sister wanda who have set that up i plan to be at those uh going forward that's been a little under the weather amen and then brother kenny's outreach last night amen uh sister mom you got to go didn't you yeah was it good yeah praise the lord so we're happy uh happy that that went like that amen so amen all right we've did all that to come to this you ready first corinthians chapter 3 and let's begin at verse 9 will catch 9-16 let you be seated for we are laborers together with god isn't that wonderful now just saying that for we are laborers together with god ye are god's husbandry ye are god's building we were preaching along that wednesday night we want to connect to that a little bit according to the grace of god which is given unto me as a wise master builder i have laid the foundation and another buildeth thereon but let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon for other foundation can no man lay then that is laid which is jesus christ now if any man build upon this foundation gold silver precious stones wood hay and stubble every man's work shall be made manifest for the day shall declare it because it shall be revealed by fire and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is now you're right there i mean that this is in real time the your this scripture is in real time right now this is to preachers this is the pastors this is to fathers mothers this is to businessmen this is the teenagers listen what are you building your life out of see now watch watch the results if any man's work abide which he hath built thereon he shall have he shall receive a reward if any man's work shall be burned he shall suffer lost but he himself shall be saved yet so as by fire know you not that ye are the temple of god and that the spirit of god dwelleth in you and he goes on down about not defiling your temple so you know you have to ask yourself the question today what kind of builder are you because we are to follow in the steps of paul god is looking for master builders see somebody who knows how to he's looking for dads who know how to father's day he's looking for fathers who know how to build a family he's looking for husbands who know how to build a relationship with their wives he's looking for pastors who know how to build a a church filled with the tabernacles of god's living presence you're with me you're with me all right that's where we're headed today all right let's pray father we thank you for your word we commit it to you now fully in jesus name amen god bless you can be seated now how many claim to be christians then you're a master builder god has put you here to build his church to build the image listen there god has a all of the anointings that came down through the ages all wrapped up in this eagle anointing and this eagle anointing is gathering all of god's family to build an image the antichrist a man with all of his horse riders is also combined in this last day and he's going to build an image amen and we find that that when the bride goes up now follow me close follow me close don't get lost in the shuffle pay attention quickly when the when the bride physically goes up and satan is literally physically cast down now he's already been cast down from his position to accuse you that revelation 5 and revelation 10 accomplished that because he's now been there's there's now we have the abstract return now we have the token so now there's there is now therefore no condemnation to them which are in christ not even possible zechariah 3 covers that satan was his charges were dismissed on the basis of election amen not that you weren't guilty not that he didn't have instant replay not that he didn't have forensic evidence of your guilt but his char his evidence was dismissed judicially on the basis of election because god chose you and he won't allow an accusation so satan has already uh been been fallen from his position to bring an accusation against you he tries to he tries to accuse you but god won't hear it so he knows he can get you to hear it you shouldn't you shouldn't listen to it you just should say god don't hear it why should i amen but we realize that by the time you get down to verse 12 chapter 12 verse 12 and verse 13 you find that he's literally cast into the earth see not just cast down nice cast down into the earth and he in he he incarnates the false prophet and that false prophet the pope becomes the beast incarnate personified amen you're following me this is rudimentary to us and so we find then that that then that false prophet preacher that pope will begin to preach to the world that they should build an image to the beast and you know what will happen he'll preach them right into it you see the power of preaching so by the preaching of a false doctrine he literally brings people to become an image to the false antichrist system the same way the flying eagle in this hour preaches a message to you and what is it doing he's preaching you into a body change you're literally under an anointing of the flying eel to see the mighty god unveiled which then reveals you so we're master builders we're here to build the image of god's likeness just like the antichrist will build the image of the antichrist likeness when we're gone he can't do it yet because we're still here which means the blood is still here because you're the blood of god by the spirit see and so the blood is still here so you have a bleeding word and therefore uh god can't send judgment and cross over blood all right because the blood is an atonement oh my friends you ain't gonna get this at this any old church on sunday morning i'm here to tell you you're getting a high a high calorie high protein diet today amen praise the lord brother joe good to see you here to find the devil amen praise the lord a devil nothing but a liar brother i got people all over the world praying for you brother joe amen praise the lord i pray for you every morning they won't even stop praying and so they make me keep giving them updates and so we're trusting the lord to completely stand our brother up in full strength again amen so so so we find then that you know if you claim to be a master builder now i want you to think this through a minute i that this this little part of this thought came to my mind uh hearing brother tim calhoun uh recently several probably a month ago on our call on our daily bible study and he mentioned this point i'm about to make now and it just blew up in my mind and became this sermon but you know if you claim to be a master builder then you need to know your way around a set of blueprints all right you're never going to get past the licensing if you can't even read if you can't even read the prints all right you not only need to read the blueprints you need to be able to understand the specifications book because you're always going to have a spec book that's going to help you understand the prince and you're also going to have to know the symbols because a blueprint is filled with symbols and there's usually a legend but sometimes i've been on jobs where it wasn't clear and you had to be able to you had to be able to go to the spec book and figure out what the symbol meant all right and so because we find out that if you don't know it uh then you run the risk of building a disaster see and it certainly would not pass inspection and listen ever ever tradesman in here knows you can cry you can jump up and down throw dirt in the air roll on the ground scream and holler call for your mama call a congressman but if that inspector won't pass your job it's full stop you don't pass go you don't collect 200 you're done you've got to pass inspection or you're never going to get a certificate of occupancy and so when god came down you know uh in this final outpouring of revival that he sent in the earth and why did he send the eagle revival to perfect a bride for a rapture but when the inspector got here he found the building in a catastrophe he found the church uh you know a completely uh uh uh in a catastrophe the schools of theology and prideful men had had built a church that was basically when a prophet saw her she was stripped naked and dancing to worldly music see and so there was no way there was no way the inspector was going to pass that there was no way for that church to go in a rapture and without christ who they had kicked out there was no way to improve amen but then i heard an eagle scream hallelujah you know it's incredible because in an age with the technology that we have that could literally spread the word of god to all the world you'd think the kingdom of god would be in full swing by now my goodness with satellites and the internet and and and and education and and and money and commerce you'd think the whole world the kingdom of god would be in full swing you know can you imagine that we have arrived instead to the days of noah and a return to the days of sodom how did this happen you know you know you can you imagine can you imagine the questions the owner would have when he showed up to his job site and saw this crooked leaning leaking falling down unsafe no inspection possible they're not going to pass it can you imagine the questions the owner would have that he would ask you if you were the master builder can you imagine the owner's questions to say you know you you said you were a builder you you said you were a because listen we're not we're not building a building like for you know for target to inhabit we're building the house of god's presence that's why the new jerusalem when john was going to be shown the bride he was shown the city because the city and the bride are are in in a type synonymous because the city holds christ and his full godhead family in his glory under his throne and you are that city right now whose builder and maker is god amen so what am i today i'm a master builder i'm claiming to the owner that i know how to build i know how to i know how to read the prince lord i understand the symbols and i understand the specifications book that saved my dad one time because my dad was smart and he and and he had gotten smart because he'd been working so long and the superintendent thought he would get a fast one by him and said ed you're gonna have to do it this way my dad said i'm certainly not he said oh yes you are and it was gonna cost my dad extra thousands my dad said nope not doing that he said it's it's not it's not that way on the prince he said it certainly is on the prince and he went and the the and the true story and the i was there and the uh the uh superintendent went to the prince and it was ambiguous it was like well you could kind of read it that way but it was vague and my but what he didn't know my dad was a reader and my dad had read the spec book and my dad said no that's not what the spec book says the spec book gives clarity to that vague detail and he and so the owner of the construction company his name was ed too he called up my dad he said ed you know he says you've got to build this weight he says that i'm not doing it he said it's not in the spec books he says he says he says well they're claiming that he says i don't care what they're claiming it's not in the spec book it's not a spec book it's not in the spec book and and and and ed the the owner of construction company says okay ed okay ed okay just what page in the spec book and brother eddie just said page and he turned you could hear him okay i'll take care of it and they had to pass money because my dad understood the symbols he understood the prints he understood the specs and the spec book is like the bible even if the blueprint has a detail the spec book overrides it you can build it by that but if the spec book had a notation and i put a symbol there and there's a notation on page 19 that you missed in the bid you're in trouble i i've been in construction my whole life i know what i'm talking about so so we find that my dad was very careful and you know paul dealt with these kinds of people give me give me romans 2 brother josh let's go and catch romans chapter 2 and we'll go to verses let's do 17-20 romans 2 17-20 so paul says to these jews behold thou art called a jew and rest in the law excuse me excuse me i'm sorry that sickness is still trying to hang on to me by my own rules i'm not supposed to be here today so y'all stay back my grandkids don't come for hugs today amen you got to stay awake and um so so we find paul says here and make us thou rest in the law and make us thy boast of god and know us his will and approve us the things that are more excellent being instructed out of law see what these guys were boasting and so paul has taken them to task and you're confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind a light of them which are in darkness an instructor of the foolish a teacher of babes which has the form of knowledge and of the truth and the law and you know by the time paul gets done with that and they read that last line they're going yes sir that's right and paul says well you who say you shouldn't steal don't you steal you who say don't do this but don't you actually do that don't see they couldn't they couldn't blow smoke to paul because paul had been in that circle paul had their number and they knew paul knew what went on behind closed doors see and so so this is why paul identified himself as a master builder that built a foundation that no other could build and so you know it's it's it's it's kind of like you know where we're we gotta we're gonna have the city called mount zion oh that city on top of mount zion amen though a pilgrim yet i love thee still i'll not leave thee through the ages when i reach man when i reach that city on the hill oh hallelujah friends that's why i think about that song and that's why you hear me say hey our future is bright i don't care what the devil's doing he ain't nobody he ain't nobody understand your future is bright friends hallelujah and so could you imagine that that that somebody would build that city because remember the city you're building that city now and you're you're using the blueprints and the spec books and the symbols all right and you had a prophet that came and could interpret the symbols could put all the pieces together and and and because we can't we can't god wasn't coming to receive a bride strip naked dancing to rock and roll she fell off into the abyss he was looking for that smooth clean girl that come by long hair beautiful smooth clean marching to the step of the gospel and it started going down she started going up and even though even when she started getting out of line she still had a profit to scream at her get back in line and brother bradham said brother branham said when i come out of the vision i was standing in the room with my arm stretched out and he said the lat and he said i was saying get back in step and he said the last thing i saw was the vision was fading says she was hurrying she was hurrying to get back instead oh i say lord we're hurrying today we just had a meeting we're having another we're hurting what are we doing here today we're hurrying to get in step hallelujah and so could you imagine god as an owner when you get a master builder imagine the preachers the that claim to be master builders imagine who who are building the supposed to be said they were master builders building the temple of god's dwelling place and could you imagine if they if it was up to them to build the city on mount zion could you imagine god could say you know it's it's it's like as if i as if i hired you to build zion it's like as if i hired you to build the city this this naked stripped down dancing to rock and roll church and god could say to all of those preachers and all of their revivals and all of their televangelism and all of their gulf streams and their learjets and all of their stretch limos and all their money and all their their program and god could say my goodness i couldn't even get you to build humans how it's it would be as if i asked you to build zion and and and and when you when where where my bride is going to dwell and where i will dwell and you build a cube amen and i can't use a cube see as a cube with walls straight up 1500 miles high it'll hide my glory no one be able to see will be behind walls and the whole city of mount zion my light is to be seen around the world it's to light up the whole atmosphere from my throne in the top and here here you have built a cube you've built a church you've built a people and i can't even dwell there i can't even it's it's of no value to me it's literally a waste of resources because my glory could not be seen in her and the word hear this friends the word was sent for his glory not my increased theology not our big programs and satellites and all of that it's all about his glory that's why the word came in this hour that's why an eagle scream that's why you've become a believer that's why god returned us back to the master builder why to build something that brings him glory you're not built here you don't come to this church just to gain theology or be a part of a program you're here to be constructed into a tabernacle of his presence hallelujah oh my titus speaks of this give me titus chapter one brother josh let's catch verse 15 16. i want you to look at a a very common thing we see today in fact is i'd say today it's more pervasive than it's ever been at any time in history titus 1 verse 15. unto the pure all things are pure now now don't read hold it stop the only way to get this purity this is ceremonial purity the only way to get that is the new birth okay so that's what he's talking about watch unto the pure all things are pure but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure but even their mind and conscience is defiled see they profess that they know god they claim to be master builders they profess that they know god but in works in works they deny him being abominable and disobedient and unto every good work replibate that's what you're seeing today i mean look look at look at 15 but but they they but to them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure i mean they they're not even pure when they're in church they're not even living pure when they're standing there crying tears and raising their hands and the the rock concert in the church is going on nothing is sacred to them it's just any old thing oh i just i just make a confession in jesus my life doesn't matter at all you're undef you're defiled you're unconverted hallelujah and and to you to you even that which is filthy is pure and even you with your disobedient lifestyle to the word of god say i'm a christian no you're not you're not you're fooling yourself you're going to go to hell thinking that a christian means to be christ-like it has nothing to do with doctrine you don't do a doctrine it's to let the life of christ live inside you doctor's not the issue you might not understand doctrine even the preachers don't understand all the doctrine sometimes we even get it twisted up a little bit but it's about the life of christ living inside of you living itself through you see so it doesn't matter what you say it's a matter it only matters if his voice echoes if his voice is speaking out of you see remember in matthew 7 gonna keep you busy josh so stay on your toes matthew 7 22 jesus identified that many people will have a sad awakening on that day watch we're talking about master builders many not a few many many will say to me matthew 7 22 in that day lord lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works now nobody's going to have the audacity to say to the lord i cast out devils and did works if that none of that actually is true are you going to lie to god and you know he knows everything so they weren't lying they actually had done many miracles and had actually cast out devils remember devils were even subject to judas amen these things work on faith in the word of god so watch so they said they said lord ah did did not we have not we prophesied we preached in pulpits on satellite around the world i flew my leader jet to every continent amen see and and and i prophesied in thy name and in thy name and cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works see luke picks this up luke 13 go there quickly brother josh luke 13 verse 25 when once the master of the house has risen up and hath shut the door and ye begin to stand without and to knock at the door saying lord lord open unto us and he shall answer and say unto you i know you not whence ye are now listen to their defense listen to their defense then shall ye begin to say what we have eaten and drunk in thy presence and that was taught in our streets listen to the royal response you ready here's the royal response but he shall say i tell you i know not whence ye are depart from me all ye workers of iniquity there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth when ye shall see abraham and isaac and jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of god and you yourselves thrust out and they shall come from the east and from the west and from the north and from the south and shall sit down in the kingdom of god um hallelujah i'm looking forward to that day friends oh you understand i want to be a wise master builder i want to i want you fathers to build it correctly i want preachers to build it correctly i want you to be the right image i'm not here today to bash denominationalism it's an antichrist system it's going to burn but i'm here to encourage you by contrast to say make sure that you're a master builder building correctly the only way to do that is build your family on the basis of the word build them on your own desires and you're going to build a catastrophe i mean your your teenagers are going to have a hard enough time if you build it right they're still going to go through a terrible time if you build it right we've got teenagers in here today who are young men and young women who came through rough patches and had some of the best parents in the world i mean i get it adam and eve had the best possible parent god they had the best possible environment the garden of eden a perfect paradise they still fell i get it that can happen understand don't beat yourself up over that but you wanna you're gonna wanna lay your head on their pillow at night and know that you did everything you could according to the word and you built this thing right and then god gave you a promise that it won't depart from them and then you can hold a token with nothing wavering and no doubt in your heart see so we find then that that luke 13 makes it clear that those you remember in matthew 25 who who who they're they were rejected they were set aside as the goats it's because that their works were iniquitous and so matthew that's why matthew 7 21 says not everyone not everyone matthew 7 21 not everyone that saith unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven so that right there is enough to let you know teenagers i don't care what street preacher you find that just tells you all you have to say is jesus is the son of god died for my sins and you're going to heaven now you'll realize that might not be true because not everyone that saith lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven well who will brother jason all right i'm a master builder i'm going to give you i'm going to read you right from the blueprints i'm going to read you right out of the spec book all right right out of the spec book but not everyone that saith unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven i tell you i feel like i feel like i want to be like jesus and say verily verily truly truly verily verily i say unto you this master builder he's gonna have a perfect bride when this thing is finished hallelujah he sent us a word in this hour and this master builder will not fail say i don't understand my life don't worry he's building you say why did this have to happen don't worry you're going to occupy a wonderful life hallelujah god's in control and you want him to be in control so what if you don't get your way take his way now i mean you know the man standing here i mean i get it he has a logical defense you know as a builder your defense would actually be a pretty good one be pretty sound be pretty logical to human reason but lord lord but you said in the in the spec but you said on the blueprints and in the spec book that the city would be built 1500 miles square you said that and and and and and the lord's answer would be yes that's right but i put a symbol on the blueprint and i attached it to a special notice of special notice you should have caught what symbol what what what where in the blueprints turn to the blueprint brother josh isaiah chapter 11 verse 9. isaiah 11 verse 9 here it was he put a symbol on the blueprint you got me isaiah 9 11 9 11 9 they shall not hurt nor destroy and all my holy mountain for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the lord as the waters cover the sea so i placed a symbol in the blueprint that it was that this zion was to be modeled after a mountain and the the master builder supposed to be could say oh i didn't understand the symbol and god would say i'm sorry you said you were a master builder just like in the early church because they said we're the ecclesia god said you're really not but since you say you are then i'm going to hold you accountable to it you you you fly your gulf streams all over the world and you get on tv and you tell people that it doesn't matter how you live and you do this and that and and and this is this is what and brother branham said you know you want it he said god sent you all the power and the gifts and the spirit and the bible and the word in his ministry he said but you wanted denominations you were determined to have organization and brother branham said that's what you want that's what god gave you now what's going to do with it it's what you wanted it's what god gave you now what you're going to do with it you're going to find out when it's time to go home that ship don't fly hallelujah i want to get on eagles wings today i want to get on eagle's wings i i appreciate a prophet who understood the symbol on the print and he said wait a minute hold on this thing ain't a cube because a cube hides his glory and his the whole city's built for his glory to be seen so if you were a real master builder you should have known the symbol you should have read the specs and should have known that the way you build a for a city with each four equal squares and yet it be like a mountain is you've got to build a pyramid not a cube and they don't understand that just like they don't understand the enoch's pyramid you know why he not you know why they can't because enoch built it out of revelation there's things of enoch's pyramid today they've had thousands of years to study it with theology and they still don't even understand the basic meaning of the great pyramid they still don't even understand that's that it didn't get kept because they rejected the word of god hallelujah but they they missed the fact that god is coming down to cap his church i'm here to tell you it took a profit to build the symbol it took a profit to interpret the symbol hallelujah and i'm glad today we had an eagle anointing that can interpret the symbols who understands the specifications see so you should have known that now i've got a city i can't use and my bride has no home to live in can you imagine the kind of fix you'd be in as a master builder standing there with the owner and he's saying i can't even use this it reminds me of the man matthew chapter 22 verse 10. it reminds me of the man who stood speechless in the presence of the king and he says matthew 22 verse 10 to 14 so those servants went out into the highways and gathered together all as many as they found both good and bad and the wedding was furnished with guests and when the king came in to see the guest he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment see the prophet is what brought us our wedding garment he's dressed the bride in the garments of the word and he saith unto him friend how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment and he was speechless he was speechless just think about that the man stood there just what will they say when you live the life every day what will they say when they're they can get on the internet and see this message spread around the world what will they say when they see videos like brother george showed today and in the in the dark jungles of africa you've got african brothers and sisters just like you and me raising their hands singing oh come and dine the masters call have come and dine oh we're part of that family friends what will they say this message this thing wasn't done in a corner god sent a master builder at the end time who understood the master builder at the beginning he understood the prince he understood the symbols he understood the specifications let us be glad and rejoice for the bride hath made herself ready hallelujah the marriage of the lamb has come then said the king to the servants bind to man and foot take him away and cast him into outer darkness there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth for many are called but few are chosen see so we see that that god's whole purpose was that this symbol in the scripture was was showing that those walls would have to be angled see and because then if they're if their brother brown said they lean and then if that's if that's the case then if you lean them 60 degrees to to make it a pyramid then you've got about the top 140 miles or so of the city visible above it you understand if you can picture that in your mind i did the math it's got about 140 because but if you were standing inside of the mountain and looking straight up like like a stove pipe it it's gonna you know if you if you lean the wall and i in that fact is in my old drawings i used to have the walls leaning all the way over and closing at the top and i realized when i thought i said wait a minute you wouldn't see his throne you wouldn't see his glory his lights to shine all over the world and so you realize that the walls do lean they go up 1500 miles but they lean over which which means they max out at about 360 miles several times higher than the than the international space station flies and then above that about 140 more miles friends of the city and the glory of god with the throne oh my and his glory lighting the atmosphere of the entire world i'm here to tell you something friends you're headed something you have not run in vain you have not believed cunningly devised tales this is the most glorious we are coming to the end of man's six thousand year run in a fallen condition and god's going to recycle the whole thing and set up a millennial world and then and then as as if that's not good enough get a thousand years of indescribable joy and happiness and then he's gonna build a whole brand new heavens and earth hallelujah and that man that mountain will push up 1500 miles high oh my and you know what it's like brother brandon when he tore the top of that pyramid that mountain off and and i was saying to you wednesday you can't you can't go to google maps and find this mountain because this google don't know where this mountain is this mountain is in a spiritual realm and he tore that off and he said no sunlight has ever shown on this before i'm here to tell you when the mount of olives cleaves to the left and the right and that mountain pushes up it's going to be virgin soil to receive a virgin pride hallelujah nothing has ever no one has ever seen the likes of what's coming hallelujah oh my and the whole thing could have been fixed every master builder could have ended well if he would have just been able to conquer his own self and humble himself with pride and that's what that's really the downfall people want their way brother branham says and humble thyself people want power really they don't know what power is see they don't really know what goes with it the way up is down always see if you want power see how humble you can get now we're not just talking about put a sad face and put on a potato sack and walk around with your head down the jews tried that they put dirt on their head and ropes on their head and show their humility jesus rebuked them as hypocrites couldn't even they even one of their prayers heard my goodness and you know and they had the audacity to stand in front of publicans and call them out and say lord i'm glad i'm not like this publican i'm glad i'm a righteous man oh my goodness no wonder their destruction was due them and jesus called the humble who were willing to lay down their life and who were willing to say not my will but thine be done i'm here to tell you something friends that's what i'm doing as a master builder i'm trying to get you i can't build you he can i've just my preaching is to try to get you to humble yourself to the word of god and and and and say lord let your word guide my life let the word teach you how to be a dad teach you how to be a mom teach you how to be a teenager teach you how to be a married young older uh to be an overcomer you've got to humble yourself to that see and he says just get away from all your worldly thinking and humble yourself before god then you've got more power than the man that runs all over the building and makes a big lot of noise see because you have been able to conquer yourself over 26 years of pastoring one of the most repeatable lines that i've had to use in counseling is brother sister you need to get over yourself i've had to use that line more than singly more than any other single line brother sister the problem you know and and you have to look them in the eye and say have you ever considered that the problem may be within you and you're looking for somebody to blame and you got a chip on your shoulder and you just need to get over yourself humble yourself before god see that's what makes us a family because none of us are trying to you know the bible says care about the needs of the other person not yourself and then they'll care about your needs and then this is what makes god happy this is what makes us a family see so brother branham talks about you know running without a message running without a message you i i don't have time to to to to turn to it but uh let me just take my last 15 minutes and give me second samuel 18. i'm gonna just take these 15 minutes and wrap it up while we're finding second samuel 18. brother branham makes these statements from go tell now listen now let's listen to this you got 15 more minutes all right so he says he says a nation or a people that denies jesus christ to be the son of god and stands in the face of our most challenging ministers of today and then in our great church league finding some 30 communist packing papers for 20 or 30 years and they're members of the communist party this is 1960. in our united churches what can we do it shows now here's what brother branham said that's a brother branham wasn't actually preaching against that he was saying that hey that's like a barometer there's something there you need it's showing you something when we see ministers and important people who have actually been living a false life that's not the focus the focus is what that's showing you what's it showing us prophet it's showing you he said it shows they have run without a message selling out the very birthrights of the nation selling out the regular birthrights of the church he goes on he says it's come to a showdown it's come to a place that the little church that's believed the message and stood on both feet with their eyes centered on the cross in their heart and resurrection of jesus christ burning it's come to a place where the nations has got to recognize it's a showdown no wonder that the churches when the council of churches it's so honeycombed no wonder with communism and it talks about the sin and the different things that are there and and this was 1960s when most churches still looked pretty decent they weren't the they weren't the tables quite full of vomit that we see today so that's uncouth i'm quoting scripture i'm sorry i don't clean up my language you know just because it's 20 21. i'm still going to quote the scripture bible says the tables are full of vomit see and like a dog that returns to it like a hog goes back to its to its wallows so so we find that he says it's honeycomb no wonder they can't believe in the supernatural no wonder they can't believe in divine healing they don't have any message in their heart no matter how hard they're running no matter how hard they're running if the holy ghost comes into a man's heart he'll believe that jesus christ is raised from dead he's alive in him to do and to do the will that he come to do the will the will of god through the man's life see that's how you know if you're born again because his will can be accomplished through your life you're out of the way you're out of the way as long as you're still just making god a convenience then then god doesn't have sway in your life i'm not saying you're not a child of god i'm just saying you better find a prayer closet somewhere and and get over yourself and let christ set the priorities listen to me teenagers you young men especially young men start today let christ and the principles of his word guide your life if if you see me being less than i should if you see your parents being less than they should i promise you this will never be less than it should this this set of blueprints will guide you home hallelujah hallelujah and he says the trouble is we run we go without a message we go with theology isn't that amazing so they go with theology but that's not a message see we go with some kind of church interpretation of the scriptures we've got to go with the resurrection see so second samuel is an interesting story now let me just tell it to you so we don't read it all and i'll i'll i'll maybe read read read parts of it but ii samuel is the story when if you'll remember in second channel 18 is when absalom has created insurrection and he's coming and joab is there and and david has got to go and they've got to have this battle to see who's going to rule so that chapter 18 is absalom's death now it's interesting because when the battle gets ready to start david takes joab and abhishei and joab's brother zariah i think maybe and he says now for my sake for my sake be kind to the young man absalom and so you know and so they the battle here they go and away they go and the battle and absalom is on his mount and he's charging into battle and he had beautiful beautiful hair you know beautiful hair has had the most beautiful head of hair in in the land is noted for it he's a very gorgeous man and he rides his mount under a a tree and the thicket of the tree caught and tangled his hair so bad that it suspended him and the mount rode out from underneath him and kept going and there he is hanging between heaven and earth by his hair and he can't free it and he's you know for whatever reason he couldn't detangle himself he couldn't i don't know why i didn't get a knife or a sword apparently for some reason i don't know maybe lost it in battle but anyway so a man comes by riding by an israelite under david's command i got everybody's attention please make sure i got your attention and so so we find that that he he he he sees absalom and he goes to joab and he says hey i saw absalom hanging in a tree and job says why don't you kill him he said i gave you i'd have gave you this many shackles of silver he said if you'd have gave me a thousand shekels of silver i wouldn't have killed him he said because the king said to not harm him and joab basically said well that might work for you but that don't work for me and he grabbed three darts and went and slew him he said where's he at and he told him and joy killed him immediately and then joab's men they cut him down and then beat him and stoned him and buried him and piled stones on top of him so so much was the venom that they had toward this man who had who had done that to david and tried to take his throne and so so now there there comes a battle and and so now it's over and here comes a man and let me pick up where i want to read um order what i want to read and cast him into okay verse 18. now absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a pillar which is in the kings dale for he said i have no son to keep my name in remembrance and he called the pillar after his own name and it is called to this day absalom's place then said ahaimes the son of zadok let me now run and bear the king tidings how that the lord hath avenged him of his enemies and joab said unto him thou shalt not bear tidings this day but thou shalt bear tidings another day but this day thou shalt bear no tidings because the king's son is dead then said joab to kushai go tell the king what thou has seen and kushai bowed himself into joab and ran then said a jaime's the son of zedek yet again to job by howsoever let me i pray thee also run after kushai and joab said wherefore will thou run my son seeing that thou has no tidings ready because this this this runner this kushai hadn't seen the end he he only he only heard a shout of victory and he gets back to the camp and that we won oh we won hallelujah can i go tell the king we won no because you don't really know the details so you've got nothing to say all right you're not going to bring the king any words of comfort because the king is looking for a specific piece of information which you don't even know anything about and so he says but let me run and so and so by whatsoever he said and and so so he says what wilt thou run my son verse 22 seeing thou hast no tidings ready verse 23 but whosoever said he let me run and he said in him run then a jaime's ran by the way of the plane and overran kushai and david sat between the two gates and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate into the wall and lifted up his eyes and looked and behold a man running alone and the watchman credence told the king and the king said if he be alone there is tidings in his mouth and he came apace and drew near and the watchman saw another man running and the watchman called into the porter and said behold another man running alone and the king said he also bringeth tidings and the watchman said me thinketh he runeth of the foremost is like the running of a highmaze the son of zedek this is the one who didn't have a message and he's running without a message he's got a part of a message now this this very same guy had been a messenger for david so he knew david knew him and he had helped david when david was hiding see he'd actually snuck out and brought secret tidings back and forth to david and so so the king said he's a good man and cometh with good tidings and a jaime's called and said unto the king all is well and he fell down to the earth upon his face before the king and said blessed be the lord thy god which hath delivered up the man that lifted up their hand against my lord the king and the king said is the young man absalom safe and the jaime's answered when joab sent the king's servant and me thy servant i saw a great tumult but i knew not what it was and the king said unto him turn aside and stand here and he turned aside and stood still and behold khushai came and kushai said tidings my lord the king for the lord hath avenged thee this day of all them that rose up against thee and the king said to kushai is the young man absalom safe and kush i answered the enemies of my lord the king and all that rise against thee to do the hurt be as that young man is and the king was much moved and went up to the chamber over the gate and wept and as he went thus he said oh my son absalom my son my son absalom would god i had died for the o absalom my son my son and so you know many many men good men i'm not i'm not here to disparage anybody that's not inside the message of the hour there's many good men out there and they ran but look at the results when they got finished running with their message they still didn't have the whole message they they the the result was you know they they wanted to run but they're not the ones who got the assignment it was like god was saying listen i've got a one star left in my right hand and i'm going to give him the assignment and many of them said well let me run let me run so he said okay run but brother branham says when they ran good men but they ran without a message and what did it produce a catastrophe a broken church that couldn't go in the rapture and you had a bride the result is that you arrived with only a partial message that couldn't bring peace nor instruction to the hearers who received your message i'm here to tell you i want to have peace when the message i hear i want to have instruction when i get a message i don't want a half message i don't want to know oh he's the son of god i already know he's the son of god but what is he today what's my direction today in satan's eden give me the peace for my family this world has gone crazy and i got to know the whole mystery hallelujah and god had one man ordained to run that way once your revelation was delivered the people were still missing the most important part of the mystery you see with calvary in play with calvary in play all was still lost without that thunder that opened the seventh seal with calvary in play all was still lost unless he took the book and loosed the seals yeah i mean here's jesus loving the rich young ruler it didn't save him here's david trying to save the life of a man who god had already determined to destroy and god won't even let him be in the battlefield because he had got in the way you see and so jesus went on to die for the sins of the whole world but but hear me jesus died for the sins of the whole world and calvary means everything but if you refuse the word of your day calvary won't save you amen i'm here to tell you if you refuse the word of your day calvary won't save you no more today than it would have back then if someone would have followed jesus and stood there and said that's my lord he's the son of god and watched him die and pledged allegiance and then when the holy spirit fell and peter started preaching and james started preaching and john started preaching and paul started preaching and you tried to say well i don't believe them but i love jesus i'm here to tell you calvary won't save you if you refused them so we're not bringing something new i defy anyone to say that i'm bringing another gospel i'm only bringing back the original this is how it's always been in the early church every church was a message church there was no such thing as a church that wasn't men made other churches man-made organization created the mess we've got now and it's a catastrophe but god sent a master builder hallelujah hallelujah and he's that holy spirit is among us today to lead you and i promise you he'll get you home he'll get your family home he'll get all your loved ones home he's worthy of our life [Music] we had a messenger who knows the whole thing he knows the mystery the other man's a good man and i saw something that i don't know what it was i'm glad we had somebody who who knew who went beyond another realm and come back and said listen church here's what the blueprint says don't get it messed up don't misplace it don't misconstrue it don't misquote it put it right in in its right order because it's a masterpiece hallelujah he's building a masterpiece this is a symphony hallelujah we're in the we're in the rhythm and the harmony of the composer hallelujah oh we ought to stand up on your feet why don't you get up on your feet today and raise up those hands and say blessed be the name of the lord god blessed be the name of the lord god because he sent me a true message send me a true messenger i have i offer no apology to the world for what god did in this day hallelujah hallelujah if god sent a rapture message and you reject it don't hope for a rapture period you might find mercy at the judgment bar i know there's people that's going to find mercy there i don't doubt that there will be millions of people in heaven who never believe the message but if you plan to live all that city of mount zion is that where you want to live
