[27:38] Lord. Nothing like it. Luke chapter
[27:42] 4. Tonight be our seventh installment in
[27:44] abiding in Christ. Luke chapter 4, we're
[27:47] going to catch it. Catch verses 14- 23.
[27:51] Luke
[27:55] 4:14-23. And Jesus
[27:57] returned in the power of the spirit into
[28:01] Galilee. Amen. And there went out a fame
[28:04] of him through all the region round
[28:07] about. And he taught in their
[28:09] synagogues, being glorified of all.
[28:13] Verse 16. And he came to Nazareth where
[28:17] he had been brought up. And as his
[28:20] custom was, he went into the synagogue
[28:22] on the Sabbath day, and stood up for to
[28:27] read. There was delivered unto him the
[28:29] book of the prophet Isaiah. And when he
[28:32] had opened the book, he found the place
[28:35] where it was
[28:36] written. The spirit of the Lord is upon
[28:40] me, because he hath anointed me to
[28:43] preach the gospel to the poor. He hath
[28:46] sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to
[28:49] preach deliverance to the captives, and
[28:52] recovering of sight to the blind, to set
[28:56] at liberty them that are bruised. Amen.
[29:01] And he began to say unto them, I'm
[29:03] sorry, verse 19, uh verse 19, to preach
[29:05] the acceptable year of the Lord. And he
[29:09] closed the book, and he gave it again to
[29:12] the minister, and sat
[29:14] down. And the eyes of all them that were
[29:18] in the synagogue were fastened on him.
[29:21] And he began to say unto them, "This day
[29:24] is this scripture fulfilled in your
[29:28] ears." And all bear him witness and
[29:32] wondered at the gracious words which
[29:35] proceeded out of his mouth. Amen. And
[29:37] they said, "Is not this Joseph's son?"
[29:41] And he said unto them, "Ye will surely
[29:45] say unto me this proverb, physician,
[29:48] heal thyself. Whatsoever we have heard
[29:52] done in Capernaum, do also here in thy
[29:57] country. I want to take a subtitle
[30:00] tonight. Physician heal
[30:03] thyself. Father, we thank you for your
[30:06] word. I pray now that Lord you will let
[30:09] it ring true Lord in our hearts. give us
[30:12] the spiritual hearing and the spiritual
[30:15] insight that we need, Lord. Even even
[30:19] just in the back office, I can hardly
[30:21] keep up with your anointing as you
[30:24] continue to add, Lord, to the thought
[30:26] for tonight. So, I trusting that we have
[30:29] it all set out in order, but of course,
[30:31] Lord, I stand ready for you to take it
[30:33] over and go in whatever direction you
[30:35] choose and however you want it said.
[30:38] Lord, I've been at this long enough to
[30:40] recognize that when it happens. And
[30:43] Lord, it's no problem with me at all if
[30:45] that's what you want to do. We just give
[30:47] it to you in Jesus name. Amen. God bless
[30:50] you, friends. You can be
[30:58] seated. Now, I'm not using a PowerPoint
[31:00] tonight intentionally. Um, I only have,
[31:04] I think, two quotes I want to read here.
[31:06] And one of them is this the quote near
[31:09] the end of Sunday service that we read
[31:12] of uh the South African pastor from the
[31:16] 19th century Andrew Murray as I said to
[31:19] you on Sunday. Uh many people think that
[31:22] he was Scottish and that's only because
[31:24] he was educated there but he was
[31:26] actually South African was educated
[31:29] there in Scotland and then also some in
[31:31] in some of the other in Denmark I think
[31:33] one of the other countries. uh he makes
[31:36] this statement and I said to you Sunday
[31:38] that it was the power of this single
[31:41] paragraph from which exploded now what
[31:44] is tonight seven installments to this
[31:46] series and what will in all likelihood
[31:49] be an eighth portion this coming Sunday
[31:52] all from just this one paragraph. So,
[31:54] it's been quite a journey for me going
[31:57] through the scriptures and bringing
[31:59] everything a prophet said over these
[32:00] last we started on it in
[32:03] December of last year and then um I took
[32:07] my vacation first couple weeks in
[32:10] January and now we're back to it. So,
[32:12] Murray says it like this and I want you
[32:14] I'm not going to put it up because we
[32:16] put it up Sunday, but I want you just to
[32:18] listen to these words.
[32:21] How is it now? He's referencing the
[32:24] rest. Jesus says, "Come unto me." We've
[32:26] read it and read it. All ye that are
[32:28] weary, heavy laden. I will give you
[32:30] rest. See, and then he goes and he
[32:32] starts talking about, you know, take my
[32:35] yoke upon you. Uh for my for my yoke is
[32:38] easy and my burden is light and ye shall
[32:40] find and we pointed that out to you. Not
[32:43] only will he give, but ye shall find
[32:46] rest to your souls. And so we've been
[32:49] emphasizing how that it was a second uh
[32:53] level or or what I would like to call
[32:55] tonight uh and maybe I've called it this
[32:57] before but tonight for sure next level
[33:00] rest because there is a rest that comes
[33:03] to the soul when you have passed from
[33:05] death to life and you have come into
[33:07] into the new birth. You've crossed into
[33:09] the promised land. uh you're you're
[33:12] you're resting as Paul said that the
[33:14] rest meant the Holy Ghost uh because
[33:18] Paul goes points back to Joshua and he
[33:21] says if crossing into Canaan's land was
[33:24] the rest promised to Israel then why did
[33:27] Joshua speak of another rest coming and
[33:31] so so we realize then that Paul says
[33:33] there was indeed yet a rest and that has
[33:36] come in the Holy Ghost because when they
[33:39] passed into Canaan's plan. That wasn't
[33:42] the long awaited Holy Ghost. That was
[33:44] just representative of the Holy Ghost.
[33:46] But the real rest of the soul for the
[33:50] family of God is to be brought back into
[33:53] fellowship by redemption. Amen. Amen.
[33:56] We've been teaching on this. You should
[33:58] be well acquainted with it by now. And
[34:00] so, but then but then Jesus goes on to
[34:03] say how that that that you know, and
[34:06] we've been connecting it to St. John 15,
[34:09] abide because now not only do you come
[34:12] to him weary for rest, but now you take
[34:17] his yoke upon you and not only shall he
[34:20] give, but you shall find rest. And so
[34:23] now we're realizing that this connects
[34:26] then to this abiding because Jesus is
[34:29] speaking to his disciples, to his church
[34:32] who have already believed on him and
[34:35] would soon not too long be in the upper
[34:37] room receiving the very Holy Ghost that
[34:40] he uh in in a in a in a in a precursor
[34:45] to the baptism breathed upon them and
[34:47] said, "Receive ye the Holy Ghost." And
[34:50] so we realize that he described it that
[34:52] when it comes, it'll be inside you like
[34:56] a well of water springing up. Now, that
[35:00] ought to inform your thinking that the
[35:02] new birth is a gene of God coming to
[35:04] life because it's in you, an artisian
[35:07] well springing up. So, we've learned
[35:10] more than what Isuza taught us. Isuza
[35:13] taught us that something comes upon us,
[35:15] and that's true. It does. But we realize
[35:17] that the new birth is more something
[35:20] that comes from within us than just
[35:22] something that comes upon us. Many
[35:25] people have the Holy Ghost come upon
[35:28] them. But it but it has to be by
[35:31] election that there's a gene of God and
[35:33] that's what brother Brandham called in
[35:35] multiple places to omnipotence met.
[35:40] Amen.
[35:41] See, so now we're at this next tier,
[35:45] this next level rest. And I've been
[35:48] stressing to you the necessity of it in
[35:51] this dark and wicked hour that we live
[35:54] in. I want to I want to double down on
[35:56] that tonight because because Sunday
[35:59] we're moving in in a in a fresh
[36:01] direction. I don't even know if I will
[36:02] if it'll be a part eight. I'll see to
[36:04] see how I feel after tonight. But I I
[36:07] want to begin to place us in prophecy.
[36:11] Where are we in prophecy in January
[36:15] 2025? Amen. And I I I think it's
[36:18] something that we ought to look into
[36:20] because brother Brandon preached and
[36:22] it's a sermon that I believe that
[36:25] ministers and particularly pastors ought
[36:27] to preach ever so ever so often. And
[36:30] that is modern events made clear by
[36:35] prophecy. You need to know what the
[36:38] modern events you see pretend.
[36:41] You need to understand what they mean,
[36:44] not only to the world, but to you. Cuz I
[36:47] promise you, they mean something totally
[36:49] different to you than to the world. We
[36:51] were looking and on Sunday and we found
[36:54] that Jesus was uh just full of doom and
[36:57] gloom telling the world what would come
[36:59] upon the earth and it would be roaring,
[37:02] waves roaring and perplexity of time.
[37:05] And it was right as we pointed out to
[37:07] you Sunday, right in that time that
[37:09] Jesus said, "Now that's terrible for the
[37:12] world." But to you, when you see that,
[37:14] look up. Your redemption draweth nigh.
[37:17] Amen.
[37:20] So this next level rest is where you're
[37:23] going to need to be if you're going to
[37:24] overcome the wickedness of this
[37:26] impossible day. This next level rest is
[37:28] where you're going to need to live if
[37:30] you intend to operate third pull power
[37:33] in your life. and I give you my word and
[37:36] the word of the scripture, you and your
[37:38] family and your children and your
[37:40] children's children are going to need
[37:42] access to the third
[37:45] pull. It's the only thing that'll defend
[37:47] you in this day. You'll never survive it
[37:50] living off the glow of another
[37:55] age. Murray says, "How is it that the
[37:59] rest you at times enjoy is so often
[38:01] lost?" Now, he's not referring to losing
[38:04] your salvation. He's referring to
[38:07] sometimes, you know, we, you remember in
[38:09] in the very first part, the very first
[38:12] installment, and I pointed to you how
[38:15] that, you know, how is it that that that
[38:18] we came to Christ and there was there
[38:21] was such a zeal and such a joy and we we
[38:24] sometimes find oursel disappointed that
[38:28] somehow that abaded and and we we've
[38:30] somehow lost and we long to get back.
[38:32] Boy, I wish I could feel it like I felt
[38:34] it the first time. I'm here to tell you,
[38:37] when you go into this rest, there ain't
[38:38] no first or second time. There's an all
[38:41] the time. Because you've broken into
[38:44] eternity and there's no yesterday.
[38:45] There's no tomorrow. There's no there's
[38:47] no you don't go back because there is no
[38:50] back. You have stepped into the eighth
[38:53] day. You have been changed. Your your
[38:55] soul is sitting together with Christ in
[38:58] heavenly places. You can't backslide.
[39:00] There's no back to backslide to.
[39:04] Amen. It's not linear for you anymore.
[39:07] Hallelujah.
[39:09] So now we're talking about that victory
[39:11] that you need every
[39:13] day because you're born again. Yeah. So
[39:18] now he says, "How is it that the rest
[39:20] you at times enjoy is so often lost? It
[39:23] must have been this. you had not
[39:26] understood how entire surrender to Jesus
[39:28] is the secret of perfect
[39:31] rest. I I'm repeating that to you
[39:36] tonight because I need to hear it again.
[39:39] Oh yeah. I think that this is something
[39:42] if I if I would say personally and I
[39:45] think you would be right there with me
[39:48] to say, you know, brother Jason, I lose
[39:50] sight of that too often and too easy.
[39:54] That it requires daily dying total
[39:58] surrender. That's what applying the
[40:02] token involves. Amen.
[40:06] You had not understood how entire
[40:08] surrender to Jesus is the secret of
[40:10] perfect rest. Giving up one's whole life
[40:14] for him alone to rule and order it.
[40:17] Taking up his yoke. Now if if the world
[40:20] is influencing your life, then then it's
[40:24] not true of you that your whole life is
[40:27] surrendered to him alone to rule. Amen.
[40:30] It's just not not trying to hurt your
[40:33] feelings. I'm just simply telling you,
[40:35] you're never going to enjoy the rest
[40:38] you're entitled to in Christ unless he
[40:41] alone is ruling over every aspect of
[40:45] your life. I'm not saying you go live in
[40:47] a in a commune or go live in the
[40:49] wilderness. You live right here in this
[40:51] world. Jesus sent his disciples out,
[40:54] right? He said, "I'm sending you as
[40:55] sheep among wolves." That's not a new
[40:57] thing. But there is a power that goes
[41:00] with you and there is a fellowship
[41:02] through redemption that you not only
[41:04] have privilege and access to but you
[41:07] have necessity
[41:10] to be connected to very closely. Amen.
[41:15] So giving up one's whole life to him for
[41:18] him alone to rule in order to order it.
[41:21] taking up his yoke and submitting to be
[41:23] led and taught to learn of him, abiding
[41:25] in him, to be and do only what he wills.
[41:29] These are, this is what burned my heart
[41:32] up so much that may the maybe the whole
[41:34] series exploded out of this line. These
[41:37] are the conditions of disciplehip
[41:39] without which there can be no thought of
[41:43] maintaining the rest that was bestowed
[41:46] on first coming to Christ. Amen.
[41:51] Jesus claims the undivided allegiance of
[41:56] the whole heart and life. Now, I don't
[42:01] need volunteers to stand up and tonight
[42:03] and say, you know, uh, you know, I, hi,
[42:06] my name is so and so. I'm a
[42:08] procrastinator. Hi, my name is so and
[42:10] so, and I, you know, I'm not needing
[42:12] that. I'm just needing you to ask
[42:15] yourself the question tonight. Jesus
[42:17] claims the undivided allegiance of the
[42:20] whole heart and life. Is that or is that
[42:25] not true about you?
[42:28] I'm not saying you're not born again.
[42:31] I'm saying you are. That's why this
[42:33] applies to you. Right? See, as I I may
[42:36] have said it, I don't remember. It
[42:37] seemed like I remember saying it Sunday.
[42:40] Maybe I said it just in my prayer,
[42:42] closing prayer. you know that that that
[42:45] that when we when we come to know the
[42:47] Lord that there is there is there is
[42:50] such a knowing such a depth that we've
[42:52] got to go to if we want to have that
[42:55] kind of realization and I do I do I do I
[42:59] want to have that kind of fellowship
[43:01] through redemption. I want to know him
[43:04] in that personal way. So you know it's
[43:08] either true or it's not true. And and
[43:10] and again, I'm not suggesting you're not
[43:13] born again. In fact, is I said to you, I
[43:16] think Sunday you might say to me, "But
[43:19] Pastor Jason, I've already been born
[43:22] again." Wonderful. You're who this
[43:25] series is to. Amen.
[43:28] You're the very one I've been preaching
[43:30] to since December. If that's true about
[43:32] you,
[43:35] Jesus claims the undivided allegiance of
[43:37] the whole heart and life. how there is
[43:39] not a spot in the whole of life over
[43:42] which he does not wish to
[43:46] reign. Now that's the first quote I
[43:48] wanted to give you tonight. I want to
[43:49] give you this one from brother Brandham.
[43:51] I think I read this at the end of
[43:52] Sunday. I want to read it again. Brother
[43:55] Brandham says, "Catch the title, power
[43:58] of transformation."
[44:00] Remember, be not conformed to this
[44:03] world, but be you transformed by the
[44:06] renewing of your mind. How many want to
[44:07] be transformed?
[44:09] You're either transformed or you're
[44:10] conformed.
[44:12] You're not in the middle. There there's
[44:14] no there's no middle ground here. You're
[44:16] either you're either conforming or
[44:19] you're being transformed. Amen. You're
[44:21] either transformed and being transformed
[44:24] more or you're allowing yourself to
[44:26] conform.
[44:32] So, brother Brandham says in the message
[44:34] power of
[44:37] transformation and he you remember he
[44:39] talked about how the world the earth was
[44:41] brought out of chaos and and a void.
[44:43] Remember it was void and darkness
[44:45] covered the face of the deep and brother
[44:47] Brandham describes what we read in our
[44:50] Bibles void and darkness covered the
[44:52] face of the deep and brother Brandham
[44:54] calls it chaos. Yes. Amen. Nature was in
[44:57] chaos. And he starts talking about how
[45:00] that the word of God brought it and
[45:02] fixed that. And so now he's bringing
[45:05] that to you and I. We were born in
[45:07] chaos. Our lives were void. I don't care
[45:11] what you have accomplished. I don't care
[45:13] how many degrees you'll ever hang on
[45:15] your wall. You might have more letters
[45:18] following your name than are in my
[45:20] entire name. But if you if Christ is not
[45:23] the king of your life, you're living
[45:26] void. Your life is just void. It'll
[45:29] equal zero at the end. And everything
[45:32] that you pursue and chase will burn to
[45:35] the ground. And and you may escape with
[45:38] the salvation of your soul. But all the
[45:41] opportunities we miss,
[45:44] the needless pain we bear, as the song
[45:47] says, all because we do not bring
[45:50] everything to God in
[45:52] prayer. Brother Brandham says that's how
[45:55] we're transformed, speaking of a
[45:57] comparison to the world. That's how
[45:59] we're transformed by God's word. When
[46:03] God said, "Let there be light." And that
[46:05] mass of creation out there come over in
[46:08] around the sun and began to revolve
[46:11] around the sun and became a garden of
[46:13] Eden because why did it why did the the
[46:17] chaotic void darkcovered earth how did
[46:20] it become a garden of Eden? Because it
[46:23] obeyed the word of God. Amen.
[46:28] Nothing more. That's all it took. It
[46:30] obeyed the word of God and became a
[46:34] garden of Eden. Because it obeyed the
[46:36] word of God, it done the perfect will of
[46:40] God. For it was transformed from chaos
[46:44] into a garden of Eden by the word of
[46:48] God. So the word of God
[46:50] restored the void and the chaos. Amen.
[46:55] You following me? The word of God
[46:58] restored the void and the
[47:01] chaos. Returning, catch that word,
[47:05] returning the earth to a fruitful order.
[47:08] Amen. Because it had previously been and
[47:11] it had went into a chaos perhaps.
[47:14] Brother Brandham said perhaps some
[47:15] previous civilization. He doesn't say a
[47:17] lot about it. And we're not preaching on
[47:18] that and we don't know the answers.
[47:20] Don't get me outside and ask me. I'm
[47:22] telling you all I know now. I can only
[47:24] tell you what he said. And I'm not even
[47:26] sure he fully. Of course, he doesn't.
[47:28] Prophets don't tell the people
[47:29] everything and God don't tell prophets
[47:30] everything. But but but there was a
[47:33] previous order. Now, that's a big point.
[47:35] Hang on to that because this is this
[47:37] because Adam is told, "Be fruitful,
[47:40] multiply, and replenish the earth." And
[47:43] so, we realize that the word of God
[47:46] restored the void and chaos, returning
[47:51] the earth to a fruitful order. every
[47:54] seed once again once again bringing
[47:59] forth of its kind. So in John 17 uh
[48:04] Jesus says in verses
[48:06] 3:5 and this is life eternal. You can
[48:10] find it uh sister Esther uh St. John
[48:13] 17:3 to5 and this is life eternal.
[48:17] What's life eternal? He's about to tell
[48:19] you that they might know thee the only
[48:22] true God and Jesus Christ whom thou has
[48:26] sent. St. John 17 verse4 I have
[48:30] glorified thee on the earth. Now he's
[48:32] talking to the to to his
[48:34] father. I He's in a prayer. I have
[48:37] glorified thee on the earth. I have
[48:40] finished my work which thou gavest me to
[48:43] do. And now, oh father, glorify thou me,
[48:49] with thine own self, with the glory
[48:53] which I had with thee before the world
[48:56] was. Catch it now. He's not a second
[48:58] person because he says, "Glorify me with
[49:01] thine own self." Jesus, knowing that he
[49:03] came from God, went back to God. And
[49:05] when he met Paul, he was back to the
[49:07] pillar of fire. So, we're not confused
[49:09] on this. This is this is where
[49:11] intellectuals get confused and they
[49:13] think it's he's two different people.
[49:15] They lose sight of the fact that Jesus
[49:17] was say he was a man, correct? But he
[49:20] was man plus. See, he was as as a
[49:24] prophet said, he was man plus. He was
[49:26] the God man. He was a he was a unique
[49:28] individual. He was a brand. He was a
[49:31] prototype of what the whole family would
[49:33] become. He's the beginning of the
[49:35] creation of God. God living in human and
[49:37] a human being. And he's going to have a
[49:39] whole kingdom of of himself divided into
[49:42] his whole kingdom. Amen. See,
[49:46] watch. I have glorified thee on the
[49:48] earth. I finished the work which thou
[49:49] gavest me to do. And now, oh father,
[49:51] glorify thou me with thine own self with
[49:55] the glory which I had. This is so
[49:58] important. With the glory which I had
[50:01] with thee before the world was. Now I
[50:04] would ask you a question tonight. Isn't
[50:07] that what we desire? Just like Jesus to
[50:10] say, "Oh, let the gospel restore me back
[50:14] to whatever I was and whenever it was
[50:17] and wherever it was, whatever I was
[50:19] before now, when I was back there in
[50:22] him. I want the gospel to restore me
[50:25] back
[50:27] to that." See? Amen. So, the gospel
[50:30] restores back to whatever it was. Say,
[50:33] "What what what was our existence?"
[50:35] Well, I don't know. We were in God and
[50:37] his thoughts were real. That's what I
[50:38] can tell you. Amen. Whatever it was,
[50:41] that's what I want to be again.
[50:45] Whatever we
[50:47] were before my life was a void. Before I
[50:51] was born into this chaos and darkness, I
[50:54] say, Lord, glorify me in the glory that
[50:57] I had with you back there before I came
[51:00] broken like this in a broken world. Do
[51:03] you realize that's why the gospel came?
[51:07] That's why that day on Calvary is so
[51:10] important. That's why Jesus had to die
[51:13] for that very reason.
[51:15] So whatever it was, whatever the world
[51:17] was, whatever that previous
[51:19] civilization, whatever previous
[51:21] condition I was in, you know, I a lot of
[51:25] times we have to be very careful
[51:27] because, you know, the the gospel is is
[51:31] not a I it's not a this is not a
[51:34] philosophy class, right? Amen. I'm not
[51:37] here teaching esoteric mysteries like
[51:39] the Gnostics and Gnosticism and and and
[51:42] you know they they think in they get in
[51:44] their their vain philosophy and Paul
[51:46] called it vain philosophy and said prot
[51:49] uh uh thinking that they were wise they
[51:52] presented themselves that way they said
[51:53] that's what they were and professing
[51:56] themselves to be wise they became fools
[52:00] it's a men it's interesting that they
[52:02] became that so that means at one time
[52:04] they weren't just like Paul said there
[52:05] was a when they worship God as the true
[52:08] God, but because they chose not when
[52:10] they knew God. They chose not to worship
[52:13] him. The world is still making that kind
[52:15] of decision. I'm glad that once I knew
[52:18] who he was. I wanted to hang on for dear
[52:20] life. I wanted to be everything like his
[52:23] word.
[52:24] You can't make that happen. That's the
[52:26] grace of God in your life. We are to
[52:28] rejoice every hour and say, "My my eyes
[52:31] see it and I'm a believer." Hallelujah.
[52:37] It's not a philosophy. It's It's not the
[52:39] gospel. The gospel is a right now
[52:41] gospel.
[52:42] Amen. And God wants to have the
[52:46] gospel to have impact in your life in a
[52:48] very meaningful way as you're hearing
[52:51] it. Faith comes by
[52:53] hearing.
[52:55] Today is the day of salvation. Amen.
[53:02] You know they Jesus said to
[53:05] them, you know, he he grew up there in
[53:10] Nazareth and he had started his public
[53:12] ministry in
[53:14] Capernaum and uh you know some
[53:17] commentators uh particularly Jameson
[53:19] Faucet Brown my JFB commentary they they
[53:22] note the angst that that must have
[53:24] caused. You know what what are we chop
[53:26] liver? Why'd you start your public
[53:28] ministry over there? you're one of our
[53:30] homeboys. So, finally Jesus goes back
[53:32] there and they they say, "You know,
[53:35] we've heard about your fame in
[53:37] Capernium." And the whole point is that
[53:40] they're not really believing him.
[53:42] They're daring him. Let's see it. We've
[53:46] heard what you can do. Let's see it. We
[53:49] believe you. No, they wouldn't. He put
[53:51] his hand on a few people and healed
[53:52] them. Say, "Well, he didn't do a whole
[53:54] lot." Well, everybody he prayed for got
[53:56] healed. Can we just say whatever little
[53:58] that he did, 100% of it worked. I don't
[54:01] need There's little is much of God is in
[54:03] it. And all I need is and and if the
[54:06] whole world don't want it, I'll take it.
[54:08] Right?
[54:10] See now so you know he said you'll say
[54:13] to me the parable because it was a
[54:14] parable that's not a scripture. He was
[54:16] using using a parable you know and he
[54:18] said you you'll say to me the old
[54:20] ancient parable physician heal thyself
[54:23] because they you know they they knew
[54:25] brother Brandham showed that that showed
[54:27] that he himself got sick just like the
[54:30] Bible says he wasn't always tempted
[54:32] things that happened to us happened to
[54:33] him and so so we realize he was in every
[54:36] way tempted so Jesus had to have faith
[54:38] for headache and have faith for
[54:40] tiredness and have faith you know he had
[54:42] to operate he was he God was determined
[54:44] to understand how it's going to be for
[54:47] you.
[54:48] This why he's a faithful high priest.
[54:50] Don't ever think he's not. Don't ever
[54:52] think Jesus doesn't know. He knows
[54:54] better than you know he knows and he
[54:58] cares. And so he said you'll say
[55:02] physician heal thyself. Of course we
[55:05] realize that Jesus
[55:07] uh did not need to heal anything beyond
[55:11] his own flesh. I mean, he in his flesh
[55:13] and in his spirit, he was in every way
[55:15] tempted. But what the point I'm making
[55:17] is Jesus didn't need healing of the soul
[55:20] like you do when you're born into the
[55:22] world. You have to be healed. The
[55:25] conversion of the soul, that's that's a
[55:26] form of healing. That's resurrection
[55:29] power. See, and so so fortunately Jesus
[55:34] did not need to heal himself beyond his
[55:36] flesh, which the flesh is the five
[55:38] senses of of this and then the five
[55:41] senses of the spirit. And so it's all
[55:43] those 10 senses that's that makes up
[55:45] your body. And so and so because that we
[55:50] know that because he lived as a man and
[55:52] he he lived the per the perceptive sight
[55:55] of the word. So first of all, he wasn't
[55:57] born in sin. Amen. See, he was God in
[56:02] flesh. If he was not God in flesh, then
[56:05] you know, if if he wasn't a man, then
[56:09] you don't have a kinsman redeemer,
[56:11] right? There'd be a redeemer, but he
[56:12] wouldn't be kin to you because he wasn't
[56:13] a human. See, so when the Gnostics said
[56:16] he wasn't a human, that broke the whole
[56:18] pattern of the gospel. The whole point
[56:20] of him coming to be kin to the human
[56:22] race was to become a human. See, so if
[56:25] he wasn't a man, then you don't have a
[56:27] kinsman. And if he wasn't God, then
[56:30] you're still dead in your sins because
[56:31] only God can forgive sins.
[56:35] So So we realize that he was the worthy
[56:38] he was his he was not only the worthy
[56:41] sacrifice, but he was a worthy
[56:44] sacrifice. He was that lamb that we
[56:48] could never quite offer. you know, man
[56:51] man because man was down here and he was
[56:55] up there and how do we how do we bridge
[56:59] that? I I need a I can't just bring a
[57:02] lamb. I can bring a lamb, but my sin
[57:04] stays on me cuz my the the the lamb is
[57:07] it has no soul. So, it can be a
[57:09] substitute and it can cover over my sin
[57:12] and judgment gets poured over and poured
[57:14] over and suspended. Your your sentence
[57:16] got suspended until Calvary. See, and
[57:19] that's what happened for Israel. God
[57:21] just kept suspending the sentence. And
[57:23] and then because he knew the lamb was
[57:24] coming. And so we realized that no
[57:28] nothing we did. We could never quite
[57:30] find that lamb that was perfect because
[57:33] that would have to come from heaven and
[57:34] man was stuck down here on the earth. I
[57:36] mean, that's the thing Job grappled
[57:38] with. Job said, "If I if I could just
[57:41] find where he lives, Amen." said, "I'd
[57:44] go up and I'd I'd go up on his porch and
[57:46] I'd knock on his door and and he said,
[57:49] "He wouldn't turn me away. He wouldn't
[57:51] he wouldn't reject me. He wouldn't judge
[57:52] me. He would put strength in me. He
[57:54] would help me if I could just if I could
[57:56] just get to where he is." David knew
[57:59] this is brother Brandham said that's
[58:00] what wearied David that David knew he
[58:03] had he had he he had hid God's word in
[58:06] his heart and he he says that and he'd
[58:09] meditated on him night and day. But but
[58:11] David was forever wearied because of his
[58:15] failures. But but the promise the
[58:18] promise to Israel had always been that
[58:22] once the Holy Ghost comes. Yeah. Then no
[58:26] one would what the Bible says no one
[58:28] will have to cross the ocean to go bring
[58:31] him to us. And no one will have to go up
[58:34] to heaven to bring him down because
[58:37] he'll be ny in thy mouth. See? Amen. And
[58:41] so I'm I'm I'm glad that Jesus didn't
[58:44] need healing of the soul or I'd still be
[58:47] without my worthy lamb. Now now now
[58:50] that's that's an an astonishing
[58:52] statement because he said this is what
[58:55] you're going to say about me. Here's a
[58:57] true statement. Physician heal thyself.
[58:59] Well, that's not really a statement that
[59:02] we that we have to say. I should just
[59:06] heal myself. But but there is that was
[59:09] what what would what would be said about
[59:10] him. But you know what is said about you
[59:13] friends that that the bride is the final
[59:16] voice to the final age.
[59:20] Amen.
[59:25] Now that is not
[59:31] um that's not just a compliment.
[59:36] Hey, let me tell you how special you
[59:37] are. You're the final voice to the final
[59:39] age. Oh. Oh, thank you. That feels so
[59:42] good to hear. That's a prophecy that has
[59:45] to be
[59:46] fulfilled in you. Amen. That has to
[59:50] happen in your everyday life in real
[59:54] time. You're And it's not just about you
[59:57] getting up here like me and shouting and
[59:59] screaming and reading a text and
[1:00:00] preaching a sermon. You're all
[1:00:02] ministers. Go ye all of you into all the
[1:00:05] world and demonstrate the gospel to
[1:00:07] every creature. Amen. So we So the fact
[1:00:10] that the bride, the Bible says it like
[1:00:13] this. Here's what the Bible says. The
[1:00:15] bride hath made herself ready.
[1:00:19] That's a prophecy that has to be
[1:00:22] fulfilled. But I want to tell you
[1:00:24] tonight that she is commissioned to
[1:00:27] achieve it. And she is being actively
[1:00:30] conditioned. She's being she's
[1:00:32] commissioned and she's being conditioned
[1:00:35] and she's being empowered to say, "I
[1:00:38] don't feel too empowered." Don't Don't
[1:00:40] cut short that God's word brought an
[1:00:43] entire void and chaos into a garden of
[1:00:45] Eden. I'm here to tell you, your faith
[1:00:48] in the word of God is more perfect than
[1:00:50] you realize. And it brought you out of a
[1:00:52] life of sin and made you love God and
[1:00:54] changed your whole nature. You think
[1:00:56] it's not going to get you into a body
[1:00:59] change? That's the easy part. The part
[1:01:02] that was the real me was away from God.
[1:01:05] But that day on Calvary bridged away and
[1:01:08] now I can come back to know him.
[1:01:12] So she is commissioned to achieve it.
[1:01:14] She is being actively uh con
[1:01:17] commissioned and conditioned. She is
[1:01:19] being empowered to achieve it. And let
[1:01:21] me just say this to you tonight in case
[1:01:23] you need somebody to give you a shot in
[1:01:25] the arm. She is achieving it. You are
[1:01:29] achieving it. I don't care how weak you
[1:01:31] feel. You are achieving it. You're here
[1:01:34] tonight believing the word. You're
[1:01:35] achieving it.
[1:01:40] The power that is
[1:01:41] connected to you and I. It comes from
[1:01:45] the word that was not only released in
[1:01:49] this day, but it was actually anointed
[1:01:51] from heaven. I think I I read that to
[1:01:54] you um from testimony. And brother
[1:01:56] Brandham talks about the word that came
[1:01:58] down and then there's some anointing
[1:02:00] that comes down that projects that
[1:02:03] portion of the word for that age. And so
[1:02:06] this bride, we know that she cannot be
[1:02:09] deceived by the spirit of
[1:02:12] delusion
[1:02:14] foretold for 2500 years. Amen. that it
[1:02:18] was coming
[1:02:20] 500 years back before Christ back back
[1:02:23] in Isaiah's
[1:02:24] day and Isaiah 60 arise shine thy light
[1:02:31] has come for darkness shall cover the
[1:02:33] whole earth and gross darkness upon the
[1:02:36] people but arise shine thy light has
[1:02:39] come shall come to the brightness of thy
[1:02:42] rising for 2500 years that that was
[1:02:47] still circling the earth to to be
[1:02:49] fulfilled at the very last day. And
[1:02:53] 2500 years of human beings never saw it.
[1:02:58] The disciples didn't see it. Jesus
[1:03:01] didn't see it. Luther didn't see it.
[1:03:03] Wesley didn't see it. Isuza didn't see
[1:03:05] it. But in this day, we've seen it. And
[1:03:07] we see it happening in the world today.
[1:03:09] And I'm here to tell you, you're it. The
[1:03:12] whole world is to be under darkness and
[1:03:14] and a gross insanity upon the minds of
[1:03:17] the people. But there is a people who
[1:03:20] saw light when it was impossible to see
[1:03:23] light.
[1:03:25] Amen. So the bride
[1:03:28] indeed this unsealed, this anointed,
[1:03:31] unsealed word of Christ handed down
[1:03:34] through an earthly angel to a to a
[1:03:37] people. And so the bride is making
[1:03:40] herself ready. Amen. So, this word
[1:03:43] speaks to us. And you you need to get
[1:03:45] that tonight, friends. Do you believe
[1:03:48] that there was a real Garden of Eden?
[1:03:51] Amen. Sure was. Do you believe that it
[1:03:53] was chaos and darkness and void before
[1:03:55] that? It sure was. But do you believe it
[1:03:58] was being restored back before the chaos
[1:04:00] and the void? And it's being restored
[1:04:02] back to something perfect. That's what
[1:04:04] the Garden of Eden is. And that's what
[1:04:06] your life is about right now.
[1:04:09] It's being
[1:04:10] restored. This is why we can do all
[1:04:13] things through Christ who strengthens
[1:04:15] us. The word should speak to your heart
[1:04:19] tonight that you are being transformed.
[1:04:22] Yeah. Amen. Say, I don't think I can
[1:04:24] make it. The word, let the word speak to
[1:04:27] your heart tonight. You are, you will
[1:04:30] make it and you are making it. Amen.
[1:04:34] See, so Jesus, you know, could heal
[1:04:37] himself
[1:04:40] physically, but then we come and so we
[1:04:43] have passed from death unto life in the
[1:04:44] soul and we're rejoicing in that and we
[1:04:47] rejoice over it. Amen. It's worth
[1:04:49] rejoicing over every day because you
[1:04:52] were on your way to a devil's hell and
[1:04:54] there was nothing you could do. If God
[1:04:56] had not have had mercy and and the Bible
[1:05:00] says that when he was on c on the cross
[1:05:02] in his agony, the Bible says he will see
[1:05:05] his seed and be satisfied.
[1:05:08] So in a very real and meaningful way, I
[1:05:11] was on his mind when he was on the
[1:05:13] cross. I was on his mind.
[1:05:17] See, so that's not my
[1:05:20] problem. The new birth is not my
[1:05:22] problem. I have long ago passed from
[1:05:24] death unto life.
[1:05:26] My problem is this fallen flesh, this
[1:05:28] fallen spirit. And you know, Jesus said,
[1:05:33] you know, you'll say, physician, heal
[1:05:36] thyself. And I I thought as I read that,
[1:05:39] I said, Lord, I'm glad to have passed
[1:05:42] from death unto life. I'm glad that my
[1:05:44] eternal destination is in you. I'm glad
[1:05:47] my soul is enjoying heavenly places. But
[1:05:50] what about this unredeemed flesh that's
[1:05:52] still here? Amen. How do I heal myself
[1:05:56] of me? Amen. How do I heal myself of me?
[1:06:00] That's right. Amen.
[1:06:04] How do I get myself? How do we get
[1:06:06] ourselves,
[1:06:07] friends with all the baggage and all the
[1:06:10] misfortune and things that have happened
[1:06:13] to us through life? And we've all got
[1:06:16] our stories we could tell.
[1:06:19] That's not why we're here tonight. And
[1:06:20] I'm not here to tell you about my past
[1:06:22] life and all the baggage that I carry
[1:06:25] because we here here's the summation of
[1:06:27] it all. I came into a broken world and a
[1:06:31] broken system by a broken method and I
[1:06:34] was broken. I was void and I was dark
[1:06:37] and I was chaotic. But I wasn't. I
[1:06:40] hadn't always been that way. Oh, and
[1:06:43] he's started the redemption process and
[1:06:46] I'm looking for him. I I I no longer am
[1:06:50] looking for him to save my soul. I'm
[1:06:52] looking for him to change this flesh.
[1:06:55] And the fastest pathway to that while
[1:06:57] I'm still here, while it's still fallen,
[1:07:00] I can have victory over it. And I can
[1:07:02] live on the outside like I love him on
[1:07:05] the inside.
[1:07:08] Amen. How do we do
[1:07:11] it? All the baggage, all
[1:07:13] the
[1:07:15] misfortune, all the setups by Satan and
[1:07:18] the traps that were sprung on us. Amen.
[1:07:22] Am I speaking to real humans?
[1:07:28] All the times
[1:07:31] when and just as soon as I say setups by
[1:07:36] Satan, we've all been there.
[1:07:40] All the traps that were sprung on us.
[1:07:42] We've all been there. Hey, let me tell
[1:07:44] you something. We've all been here, too.
[1:07:46] All the times when our own feet ran
[1:07:48] swift against you.
[1:07:51] All of it happening in real time as as
[1:07:54] if that's not bad enough. We're born in
[1:07:57] the worst of all ages. Yeah. Where Satan
[1:08:00] is actually the god of the evil age and
[1:08:04] has had 6,000 years now to perfect his
[1:08:07] Eden and build his
[1:08:09] Eden. Oh, in my soul, I have passed from
[1:08:12] death to life. But how do I heal the
[1:08:17] rest of me?
[1:08:20] How do I deal? How do we deal? Friends,
[1:08:22] let's just be honest tonight. I I'm
[1:08:24] going to take these last 15, 16 minutes.
[1:08:26] You good? Yeah. How do we get the rest
[1:08:29] of us healed? And as Christians, we want
[1:08:35] it more than anything. I mean, if we
[1:08:38] weren't born again, we wouldn't care,
[1:08:40] right? Our nature would be like the
[1:08:43] world and the world would just be the
[1:08:44] world and you'd be part of it. People
[1:08:47] come to church and they don't care. You
[1:08:49] can preach whatever you want. They don't
[1:08:51] care because they don't even desire
[1:08:53] that. But the very fact that I have
[1:08:55] passed from death to life and now I'm
[1:08:57] dealing with this old pest house and I
[1:09:00] say, "How do I get this guy on the
[1:09:02] outside like the guy on the
[1:09:04] inside?" Oh my. Do you understand the
[1:09:07] great secret of abiding in him? Do you
[1:09:11] understand that this is where that rest
[1:09:13] comes to where you c you can have rest
[1:09:16] not only for your souls, but you can
[1:09:18] learn of him? Amen. Not only will he
[1:09:22] give, but you shall find rest in the
[1:09:25] learning and and how Jesus, brother
[1:09:27] Brandham says, Jesus uh demonstrated the
[1:09:31] character of God. I got a quote I'm
[1:09:33] going to read you here in a moment.
[1:09:34] Brother Caleb sent me. So, so wonderful.
[1:09:36] Goes with another quote that I won't use
[1:09:38] tonight. I'll get to it
[1:09:40] Sunday. But we find friends
[1:09:43] that a lot of times we have lingering
[1:09:46] weaknesses. Sometimes, not sometimes,
[1:09:48] let me just say it like this. all the
[1:09:50] time. Everybody has complexes.
[1:09:54] Amen.
[1:09:56] We have lingering weaknesses. We have
[1:09:58] complexes. We have failures. Some of
[1:10:01] it's from heredity.
[1:10:03] Sure. Absolutely. Brother Brand would
[1:10:05] call it the grabag of life. Yeah. And
[1:10:08] and and th those are things, you know,
[1:10:10] like brother Bam talked about his, you
[1:10:12] know, his his daddy was Irish and his
[1:10:14] his grandmother was a full-blooded
[1:10:16] Indian and his mother was a half Indian,
[1:10:18] which made him half half of a half
[1:10:20] Indian and a and Irishman. So he had an
[1:10:22] Irish temper and he was a half breed
[1:10:25] from from a Native American tribe. And
[1:10:28] and and he admits to that he was a mess.
[1:10:31] It made his stomach nervous. He couldn't
[1:10:33] hold food down. He was always getting in
[1:10:35] fights. He had a a a an uncontrollable
[1:10:38] temper.
[1:10:40] Even to the point of trying to murder
[1:10:42] boys and him just a boy. Amen. All
[1:10:46] because somebody punched him and he's
[1:10:47] ready to shoot
[1:10:48] them. See, so we get these things.
[1:10:52] Brother Brandham talks about that before
[1:10:54] we come to the Holy Ghost and and and
[1:10:56] and the things sometimes that come to us
[1:10:58] through heredity. But you know, just
[1:11:01] like the earth, void and dark. Uh but in
[1:11:05] this case it's you know it's it's not
[1:11:07] from some previous civilization but it's
[1:11:10] from some previous gene pool. Amen.
[1:11:15] The earth was dark and chaos and void
[1:11:17] and it it was the effects of some
[1:11:20] previous civilization. And I can say
[1:11:23] tonight, I got things in my heredity and
[1:11:25] things in my spirit and complexes and
[1:11:27] baggage and failures and memories and
[1:11:30] hurts and wounds and and it and it's and
[1:11:32] it's and it's not it's not a previous
[1:11:35] civilization. Some of it's a previous
[1:11:37] gene pool that I came from. May maybe it
[1:11:39] jumped several generations and landed on
[1:11:41] me and skipped all the rest of my
[1:11:43] family. You know what I'm talking about.
[1:11:45] Yeah.
[1:11:48] Come and then and then as if that's not
[1:11:50] as if as brother Brandon would call it
[1:11:52] the grabag of life. As if that's not bad
[1:11:54] enough then the complexes and the
[1:11:56] weaknesses from the poor choices we've
[1:11:58] made in life. Yes. Amen. Amen.
[1:12:05] I have to do like brother
[1:12:11] Fred reaching to the back. a way to
[1:12:14] back. Don't get to be quiet. Watch this.
[1:12:16] It works on Brother Luther. Brother
[1:12:17] Luther. Yes. See
[1:12:23] there. Amen. Praise the Lord. Micah and
[1:12:26] Jackson are about to have a heart
[1:12:27] attack. Am I going to call on them?
[1:12:31] Praise the
[1:12:34] Lord. We've made some, haven't we,
[1:12:36] friends? Poor choices.
[1:12:40] Sometimes
[1:12:41] things done to us. Sometimes, let's be
[1:12:45] honest, let's be real. Sometimes things
[1:12:47] we did to ourselves. Oh yeah.
[1:12:51] You've met God in a new birth.
[1:12:54] And that cleansed your soul in the sight
[1:12:57] of God. Thank God. But now it's time for
[1:12:59] you to allow the mind that was in Christ
[1:13:05] to be in you. Amen.
[1:13:08] How many want that?
[1:13:11] Now it's time to both and catch it to
[1:13:15] both know him and conjunction the power
[1:13:20] of his resurrection. I know him because
[1:13:23] I came to him in a new birth. But Paul
[1:13:26] says that I may know him and the power
[1:13:29] of his resurrection.
[1:13:33] Only the mind of Christ that is
[1:13:36] surrendered
[1:13:38] daily can
[1:13:40] take it's the only thing that can take
[1:13:43] you to that next level of rest that we
[1:13:48] desire.
[1:13:49] It's the only thing that could offset
[1:13:51] the plague and the curse of this evil
[1:13:54] day that the that the Holy Ghost knew
[1:13:57] was coming. Jesus knew it was coming.
[1:14:00] This hasn't crept up on God. He had He
[1:14:03] didn't put you in this age and go, "My
[1:14:05] goodness, it's worse than I thought. I'm
[1:14:06] going to have to go back to the drawing
[1:14:08] board." He sent you a a perfect eternal
[1:14:11] word and unsealed it and has an
[1:14:14] anointing down upon the word that you're
[1:14:16] feeding on. If you're feeding on it, are
[1:14:19] you feeding on it? It is the word that
[1:14:22] God released under that when he opened
[1:14:24] the seventh seal. He's got an anointing
[1:14:26] on that word. But you've got to eat it.
[1:14:28] You've got to consume it. Amen.
[1:14:32] See, in this day when growing anxieties
[1:14:35] and insanity and men's hearts failing
[1:14:38] for fear and and and it would be orders
[1:14:41] of magnitude worse than any other age,
[1:14:44] orders of magnitude worse, not even
[1:14:46] comparable to any other
[1:14:49] age. An abiding fellowship with Christ.
[1:14:52] I want to say it to you very clearly. An
[1:14:55] abiding fellowship with Christ is the
[1:15:00] only answer. Amen.
[1:15:03] You remember Sunday I said if you don't
[1:15:05] have
[1:15:06] that, if if that's not your daily
[1:15:09] practice and you're constantly pressing
[1:15:11] into that, then you're not likely to
[1:15:14] follow God's plan for you very well
[1:15:16] because you'll always be interfering
[1:15:18] with it because we want what we want
[1:15:20] when we want it. Y'all didn't probably
[1:15:22] didn't want to hear that again. I just
[1:15:24] have said it again. Come on. We want
[1:15:27] what we want when we want it. And this
[1:15:30] age is full of nothing but a growing
[1:15:32] insanity and growing anxiety. And I'll
[1:15:35] say it again, an abiding fellowship with
[1:15:38] Christ is the only answer. That is what
[1:15:42] applying the token daily is.
[1:15:46] Applying the token is not some
[1:15:48] esoterical,
[1:15:49] philosophical, oh, what does that even
[1:15:51] mean? It means what we're preaching.
[1:15:53] It's an application. You're you're
[1:15:56] applying the word in your daily life.
[1:15:58] The word for you is a person that when
[1:16:01] you're living it and following it,
[1:16:03] you're fellowshipping the person. Amen.
[1:16:06] Because the word is a person.
[1:16:09] It's applying the token to your life, to
[1:16:11] your home, to your family. I'm here to
[1:16:14] tell you something, friends. Applying
[1:16:15] the token is, has been, and always will
[1:16:19] be. It is still the answer to Satan's
[1:16:22] question. Applying the token is still
[1:16:25] the best answer to the challenge of the
[1:16:27] devil. When he comes into your home or
[1:16:30] into your family or into your body or
[1:16:32] into your finances, you can apply the
[1:16:34] token with confidence.
[1:16:38] Amen. To my lost child, it doesn't
[1:16:40] matter how lost your child is. You can
[1:16:43] apply the token. You have the power of
[1:16:45] the spoken word. And that's the third
[1:16:47] pull. All you have to do is abide in
[1:16:49] Christ and let his life speak. Yes.
[1:16:52] Amen. He'll bring life. He found you,
[1:16:54] didn't he? That's right. You were
[1:16:56] probably worse than your child.
[1:17:00] Sure. He found you, didn't he? Amen.
[1:17:07] Brother Brandham
[1:17:09] says, "From believing from the heart."
[1:17:12] Brother Caleb sent me this and it's so
[1:17:14] glorious. And I thought to
[1:17:19] myself, Lord, I because I was thinking
[1:17:22] to myself how I would I had read
[1:17:24] numerous quotes that talks that talks
[1:17:26] about what we're trying to preach. And
[1:17:29] then this exact quote is so flawless and
[1:17:32] so perfect it can't even be improved
[1:17:35] upon. I'm not going to paraphrase a word
[1:17:37] of it. I'm going to read it to you
[1:17:38] verbatim. Amen.
[1:17:41] Brother Brandham says,
[1:17:44] "Notice, I begin to think this." Now,
[1:17:48] there's a lot in that. I begin to think
[1:17:51] this because he's already talking about
[1:17:54] all his ministry since 1933 down on the
[1:17:59] river. And a and a voice is speaking
[1:18:02] from a star hanging over his head and
[1:18:04] people are witnessing it. And he's now
[1:18:07] he's he's including t he's in a cave and
[1:18:10] he says I hear someone walking and and
[1:18:12] coming into that light stepped a man and
[1:18:15] he said in human figure about 200 lb
[1:18:18] shoulder length hair is barefoot and he
[1:18:20] said I've been sent from the presence of
[1:18:22] God to tell you about your peculiar
[1:18:24] ministry. Remember he was out there
[1:18:26] under the tree shaving and and he said
[1:18:29] that thing come upon me. He said I
[1:18:30] didn't know what to call me. I called it
[1:18:32] a trance. And he said, "The whole world
[1:18:34] seemed to spin and I hit the ground and
[1:18:35] hope come running out. Billy, what's
[1:18:36] wrong?" And he said, "I'm going to my
[1:18:38] cave. I'm going to my cave. I I can't
[1:18:40] even are or probably meet at that time.
[1:18:43] I'm going to my cave. I've got to I'm
[1:18:44] not coming back. Don't look for me to
[1:18:46] come back. I got to have an answer what
[1:18:48] this is." And his brother-in-law telling
[1:18:50] him, his Baptist brothers, Billy, it's
[1:18:52] of the devil. It's spiritualism. Stay
[1:18:53] away from it. So, here comes an angel to
[1:18:56] say, "I've come from the presence of God
[1:18:58] to explain to you your peculiar
[1:18:59] ministry." Amen.
[1:19:02] That's all included. I mean, we're
[1:19:05] talking about his trips overseas and the
[1:19:08] things that happened and some of those
[1:19:10] great meetings there. That's all
[1:19:12] included in this. Notice, I begin to
[1:19:16] think
[1:19:17] this. So, I want you to absorb who it is
[1:19:20] that's saying this and what he's been
[1:19:22] through to get to this point. I begin to
[1:19:25] think
[1:19:27] this. Now, he would later confirm it and
[1:19:30] speak to the mountain. Yeah. And I'm
[1:19:32] gonna I've read that for you when I was
[1:19:34] in that series last year. I'm going to
[1:19:36] read you that quote again where he talks
[1:19:38] about people willing to live up in those
[1:19:39] spheres of
[1:19:41] God. So, this doesn't
[1:19:44] change. And he says in 1957, I begin to
[1:19:48] think
[1:19:49] this that it is possible that when a man
[1:19:53] like the apostles and when you can live
[1:19:58] close to God and God through his grace
[1:20:03] operate operates through you that the
[1:20:07] more of God you get, the more godly you
[1:20:11] become.
[1:20:13] The more eternal life comes in, the more
[1:20:17] of the intellectual it pushes
[1:20:20] out. Now, I don't mean to be a fanatic.
[1:20:22] I mean to be a real sane, sound
[1:20:24] believer. See, not a bunch of ism, but a
[1:20:28] real solid, true, sensible, intelligent
[1:20:31] believer. And now watch, I've seen it
[1:20:33] work. And to think that if you get into
[1:20:37] that contact with God, it becomes till
[1:20:41] it isn't your voice anymore, it's not
[1:20:44] your thought anymore. It becomes God's
[1:20:48] thought and God's voice you're and he
[1:20:51] goes right to where we've been reading
[1:20:52] in St. John 15. You are just a vine or
[1:20:55] just a branch. He's the vine and it's
[1:20:58] his spirit that goes in and energizes.
[1:21:03] As long as you can get yourself out of
[1:21:06] the way, he'll fill it up and then you
[1:21:10] can be a witness. Amen.
[1:21:21] When we talk about a
[1:21:25] world spinning in
[1:21:28] chaos, when we talk about a world that's
[1:21:31] void and
[1:21:34] dark, I don't know,
[1:21:36] friends, some of you, some of you young
[1:21:39] people aren't very old. Some of you are
[1:21:42] as old as me and older.
[1:21:44] Wherever you are in life's
[1:21:48] journey, maybe the
[1:21:51] devil, like the earth, whatever whatever
[1:21:54] caused that previous civilization, we
[1:21:56] don't know. All we knew, remember
[1:21:58] Sunday, all we could conclude was that
[1:22:00] it it established the bedding ground for
[1:22:02] a restored kingdom, one that would never
[1:22:05] pass away. Hallelujah.
[1:22:07] I'm here to tell you something, friends.
[1:22:08] I'm never going to pass away. And I'm
[1:22:10] never going back to the void. I'm going
[1:22:12] onward and upward.
[1:22:15] But the bottom line is that sometimes
[1:22:17] that's where our life ends up. And maybe
[1:22:19] the devil has dragged some of us through
[1:22:21] the ditches long enough to where you
[1:22:25] feel maybe you've already at the point
[1:22:28] tonight. Maybe I'm speaking to someone
[1:22:30] in this audience or over the airwaves or
[1:22:32] by an
[1:22:34] archive. But this is what the Lord laid
[1:22:36] on my heart to say.
[1:22:39] Maybe you feel that life has little or
[1:22:44] no purpose for you because of the way
[1:22:47] the devil has dra drug d drug d drug d
[1:22:49] drug d drug d drug d drug drug d drug d
[1:22:49] drug d drug drug you through the ditches
[1:22:50] of
[1:22:52] life. Is it
[1:22:55] possible that it always has actually had
[1:22:59] more purpose than you've imagined and
[1:23:03] only Satan has kept it from you? Amen.
[1:23:09] Now, I say again, he's not a
[1:23:12] philosophical devil. He's a real devil.
[1:23:15] That's why philosophy can't help you.
[1:23:18] It's why this is not a philosophy class.
[1:23:20] He's not a phil philosophical devil.
[1:23:22] He's a real devil who fights God over
[1:23:27] the dominion of your soul and your mind
[1:23:31] and your heart and your spirit and your
[1:23:34] life and your lifestyle and your goals
[1:23:36] and dreams. He fights God over control
[1:23:40] of you. Amen. Who can have the control?
[1:23:46] And that's why it was so wonderful to me
[1:23:49] Sunday when we were reading there. And
[1:23:51] when these things begin to come to pass,
[1:23:54] then look up and lift up your heads for
[1:23:57] your redemption draweth nigh.
[1:24:00] If I can just get you to look
[1:24:04] up and maybe maybe you would say
[1:24:08] tonight, "Pastor, my life is simply too
[1:24:12] broken to look up." Could I say to you
[1:24:16] that that's what Moses thought?
[1:24:19] And brother Brandham said, "There he was
[1:24:21] coming down that trail that day. He's 80
[1:24:24] years old. He's already 80 years old,
[1:24:27] right?
[1:24:29] And he's 40 years out of Egypt now. 40
[1:24:32] years in the in the in the desert and
[1:24:35] he's hurting another man's livestock.
[1:24:38] And brother Brandham says he stops and
[1:24:40] he takes an he he he does an an
[1:24:42] appraisal of his life. And he's standing
[1:24:45] there and he says, "I guess it's too
[1:24:47] late now. I've already ruined it. And
[1:24:50] brother Brandham said the great crystal
[1:24:52] tears began to roll down his face and
[1:24:55] across his beard. And it was right then
[1:24:58] he said that he turned. He heard the
[1:25:01] sound of a crackling flame. And he
[1:25:03] turned and he turned aside. He turned
[1:25:06] aside away from his own thinking, away
[1:25:09] from his life that looked like a failure
[1:25:11] to him. I'm here to tell you Moses was
[1:25:13] just getting started. And God had a
[1:25:15] great thing ahead. I don't know where we
[1:25:18] are. I don't know how you got here. I
[1:25:20] got a story. You got a story. We all got
[1:25:22] stories. I just know this. However I am
[1:25:25] now, that's not how I started. And I
[1:25:27] know the next thing I'm going back to
[1:25:29] how I started. And I know that I'm on my
[1:25:31] road. And I know God has a greater
[1:25:33] purpose for me. And I and I I cannot and
[1:25:36] I must not and I will not allow myself
[1:25:40] to say it's too broken. It's there's no
[1:25:43] purpose. Friends, don't let the devil
[1:25:46] keep lying to you. You can abide in
[1:25:49] Christ. This is why he would say abide
[1:25:51] in me. I in you, you and me. Outside of
[1:25:54] me, you can do
[1:25:56] nothing. Because that's the age that we
[1:25:59] live in. That's the that's the tyranny
[1:26:01] of the devil. Abraham thought the same
[1:26:04] thing. Abraham actually Abraham is
[1:26:07] lamenting to God. Oh, you gave me all
[1:26:10] these promises and I don't even see it.
[1:26:12] Now I'm an old man and now it's too late
[1:26:14] and and and and you told me I'd have an
[1:26:16] heir and and now I've got this one in my
[1:26:18] household and he's going to get
[1:26:20] everything and I don't see your promise.
[1:26:22] And Abraham was crying and boohooing. He
[1:26:25] didn't see no way humanly possible. And
[1:26:28] God come down and said, "This shall not
[1:26:30] be thine air, but out of thine own bow
[1:26:33] shall be thine heir." And God took an
[1:26:35] old man and turned him back young and a
[1:26:37] wife and turned her back young. I'm here
[1:26:39] to tell you there's nothing that he
[1:26:41] cannot do to to equip you and to empower
[1:26:44] you. I don't care how you game. I don't
[1:26:46] care what's happened. I don't care about
[1:26:48] baggage. I don't care about heredity. I
[1:26:50] don't care what's happened. You can
[1:26:52] bring the token and the presence of God
[1:26:54] into your life. And and you can restore
[1:26:57] void and you can restore chaos and bring
[1:26:59] your life and the life of your family
[1:27:01] and the life of everyone you love back
[1:27:04] into a perfect order.
[1:27:07] Don't let Satan tell you you can't or
[1:27:11] it's too late. It's
[1:27:15] never too late.
[1:27:19] It's never too late. Let's
[1:27:24] stand. Oh
[1:27:31] my. You know, I thought about Abraham
[1:27:35] and how that
[1:27:38] he I said to you Sunday, the Lord told
[1:27:41] him, you know, lift up now thine eyes.
[1:27:44] This was this was Abraham's word. If you
[1:27:47] want to Abraham, you've you've been
[1:27:49] through trials. You've been on a
[1:27:50] journey. It's been this. It's been this
[1:27:52] long. You haven't ran perfectly. You've
[1:27:55] had errors. Abraham had had errors. Now,
[1:27:58] you didn't get to read about him in the
[1:27:59] New Testament because the blood of Jesus
[1:28:01] Christ called it all. And and Paul said
[1:28:03] he never staggered at the promise of
[1:28:05] God. Never said Abraham was perfect.
[1:28:07] Said Abraham never staggered at the
[1:28:10] promise. And I sometimes I have come
[1:28:13] back to the Lord and I've said, "Lord,
[1:28:16] I'm sorry for
[1:28:19] that mental failure, spiritual failure,
[1:28:22] fleshly failure, whatever kind of a
[1:28:25] failure it was." But I can always come
[1:28:27] back and say, "But Lord, my faith in
[1:28:31] your word is perfect."
[1:28:35] Say, "I'm looking for perfect faith. I
[1:28:37] already got
[1:28:38] it. I have perfect faith in the word
[1:28:42] that God has sent in this
[1:28:44] hour. I don't intend to
[1:28:47] let the things of this world." Now, some
[1:28:50] people will, some people already are.
[1:28:53] Some
[1:28:54] believers are living
[1:28:56] today as believers. I get it. They're
[1:29:00] believers for real believers. They
[1:29:03] really do believe. They really have had
[1:29:06] an experience with
[1:29:08] God. But but they're allowing the enemy
[1:29:12] to cause them to have a divided
[1:29:15] allegiance. It shows up in their church
[1:29:17] life. It shows up in their prayer life.
[1:29:19] It shows up in their shows up in their
[1:29:22] home and their family and their
[1:29:23] children. It it it those kind of things
[1:29:25] you you don't hide. And I can tell you
[1:29:27] the longer it goes, those kind of things
[1:29:29] become very
[1:29:31] painful. And I just say to my young
[1:29:33] people tonight, don't end up where some
[1:29:37] where some have ended up where they're
[1:29:39] having such pain of regret. You're
[1:29:41] young. Take a hold of the Holy Spirit
[1:29:43] now. Live for God. Let the Holy Spirit
[1:29:46] come in and rule every aspect of your
[1:29:49] life. Say, "I'm going to be one of those
[1:29:51] that crossed the finish line and I'm
[1:29:53] going to have this testimony. I ran with
[1:29:55] the Lord all the way. I I made up my
[1:29:58] mind that I was going to serve God. I'm
[1:30:01] going to make a rapture and I'm never
[1:30:03] looking back." Friends, that level of
[1:30:05] victory is possible. I just read it to
[1:30:08] you. Brother Brandham said that 1957 and
[1:30:11] he says it again and speak to this
[1:30:13] mountain when he's talking about the
[1:30:15] power of the third pool and speaking
[1:30:16] swirls into existence. And that's where
[1:30:19] he has that wonderful statement. He
[1:30:20] said, "I realized that that anybody
[1:30:23] anybody who's willing to live in those
[1:30:25] upper spheres with God, then it won't be
[1:30:28] God. It won't be you speaking. It'll be
[1:30:30] God speaking. Say, I got a terrible
[1:30:32] need. I don't know how this is going to
[1:30:33] happen. Why don't you let God speak to
[1:30:35] it? Amen. You've spoke to it and it's
[1:30:38] never done anything. You've you've
[1:30:41] jumped up and down and cried tears and
[1:30:43] wallered around. Why don't you just let
[1:30:45] God come in and have complete control of
[1:30:47] your life and he'll start speaking to
[1:30:49] whatever needs spoken to? Oh, that's a

[1:30:56] another sermon on that. But gather with
[1:30:58] me. We've got a number of prayer
[1:30:59] requests we're going to take to the Lord

[1:32:29] um, Brother Aaron writes in, "Please
[1:32:32] remember Ruth and I in
[1:32:34] prayer. We have a big decision to make
[1:32:37] coming up and need the Lord's guidance."
[1:32:40] Amen.
[1:32:42] Sister Meredith sent to me, "Please
[1:32:44] continue to keep my mom in prayer. She
[1:32:47] is better, but blood pressure is a
[1:32:50] little all over the place, and she still
[1:32:52] is dizzy and doesn't feel quite right."
[1:32:55] Sister Hope wrote also to say a prayer
[1:32:57] request. Um, several special
[1:33:03] um unspoken requests for my older
[1:33:05] children, Sarah, Abigail, Angel, and
[1:33:08] Benjamin. Oh, that's a mother's heart.
[1:33:11] the Lord is able to meet that need.
[1:33:13] Amen. That's all the requests that came
[1:33:16] in. I appreciate everybody I sent out
[1:33:18] today asking that you send in a request.
[1:33:21] Amen. Do you have requests, brother?
[1:33:23] Yeah.
[1:33:26] Okay.
[1:33:29] Miss Elissa. Alyssa. All right. Miss
[1:33:32] Elissa. You write that
[1:33:36] down. All right. Praise the Lord. Now,
[1:33:40] by an uplifted hand, anybody else want
[1:33:42] to say, "Lord, you see my need upon my
[1:33:44] heart." And we're going to pray for this
[1:33:46] need for our brother Aaron and sister
[1:33:48] Ruth. We're going to pray, Amen, for
[1:33:50] Sister Meredith's mother, Sister Linda,
[1:33:53] and Sister Hope Smart also in California
[1:33:55] is asking these unspoken requests for
[1:33:58] her older children. Amen. Join with
[1:34:00] somebody standing near you. Let's go to
[1:34:02] the Lord. And this this request also
[1:34:05] from Brother Enoch.
[1:34:07] Father, we're joining together right
[1:34:09] now, Lord. And tonight, Lord, your word
[1:34:12] went forth. And we are we are we want to
[1:34:15] say, Lord, that we are believers of your
[1:34:17] word. And we pray and we ask that your
[1:34:20] word will take effect in our lives,
[1:34:22] Lord. Oh Lord, I desire it so much. And
[1:34:26] I we we deal with this human flesh and
[1:34:29] all of its weaknesses. Lord God, help
[1:34:32] us. We've we've read tonight. We've
[1:34:34] proven it in the scriptures. We've
[1:34:36] proven it throughout the message. We've
[1:34:38] proven it, Lord, by great sages of old
[1:34:41] down through that man age, Lord. Some of
[1:34:43] those great 19th century thinkers, Lord,
[1:34:46] and they all knew this great secret.
[1:34:48] Father, I pray that you will help us
[1:34:51] tonight in this day where everything is,
[1:34:54] you know, at at the fingertips and
[1:34:56] knowledge has increased and and men's
[1:34:58] mind, hearts failing for fear and the
[1:35:00] insanity and anxiety of the ages, Lord.
[1:35:03] and we get swept away by it if we're not
[1:35:06] careful. We've met you. We've met the
[1:35:09] pillar of fire. But Lord, we need to
[1:35:12] come into that place where we have that
[1:35:14] next level of rest, that next level
[1:35:17] where God, yay, Lord, where God is in
[1:35:20] control of all of our lives. Oh God,
[1:35:23] he's in control. Tomorrow morning when
[1:35:26] we wake up, you'll be in control of our
[1:35:29] of all of our waking moments. Lord, I
[1:35:32] pray you'll grant it. We don't know how
[1:35:34] much time we have left here, but we do
[1:35:36] know that the world is falling off a
[1:35:38] cliff. Oh Lord God, move in our midst. I
[1:35:41] pray make these words real to our
[1:35:43] hearts. Let those listening across the
[1:35:46] airwaves, Lord, let it be a prick in
[1:35:48] their hearts, if they need to move
[1:35:49] closer to you, may they move up, Lord
[1:35:51] God. May they may they Lord God, we know
[1:35:54] that that there are times when not not
[1:35:57] everyone can make it to the house of
[1:35:59] God. But we're but what we also know
[1:36:01] Lord if we're honest is that too many
[1:36:04] times we let the priorities of the world
[1:36:07] move move aside the priorities of the
[1:36:09] world of the word Lord God and the word
[1:36:13] the priorities of the world move aside
[1:36:15] the priorities of the word. Help us
[1:36:17] tonight, Lord God, to see that reversed
[1:36:20] in our lives. To this visible audience,
[1:36:22] to the invisible audience, may it be so.
[1:36:25] Lord God, I pray for us. I pray for us
[1:36:27] as a body of believers. I pray for the
[1:36:30] leaderships and ministry and the
[1:36:31] officers. I pray for the family and our
[1:36:33] young people. Lord, let the Holy Spirit,
[1:36:36] Lord, have complete control of every
[1:36:38] aspect of our
[1:36:40] lives. May you grant it to us, Father.
[1:36:44] Now Lord, you see here's a need that
[1:36:46] brother Aaron and Sister Ruth have to
[1:36:48] make, Lord. And the the the the
[1:36:51] the decision must be made
[1:36:53] quickly. And Lord, it's a a momentous
[1:36:56] decision. It's not a small thing. And
[1:36:59] but but you're you love big things,
[1:37:01] Lord. You're you're you're we're to ask
[1:37:03] big things. The prophet said, "Ask God
[1:37:05] for big things." He believe he's a
[1:37:08] heavenly father. He wants to be involved
[1:37:10] in our lives. Lord, I pray that you will
[1:37:13] give them your perfect mind, your
[1:37:15] perfect wisdom. Let them go forth with
[1:37:18] faith, knowing that they have the mind
[1:37:20] of Christ. Lord, then no matter what
[1:37:23] happens forward after that, there will
[1:37:24] be no worry. The devil won't have a way,
[1:37:27] Lord, that he can cause an strife over
[1:37:29] it because they will know that they move
[1:37:31] forward with faith. May you grant that
[1:37:33] to them, Lord. How I've had you grant
[1:37:36] that to me so many times over the years,
[1:37:40] Lord. I pray for Sister Linda Maxwell
[1:37:43] tonight and Sister Meredith, Lord, who's
[1:37:45] there caring for her. We love our sister
[1:37:48] Linda and we're asking for your mercy,
[1:37:49] Lord God. Touch her in body, Lord. Lower
[1:37:52] that blood pressure. Cause the dizziness
[1:37:54] to leave her. May she stand all upon her
[1:37:57] feet well, lifting hands for the glory
[1:37:59] of God. May you grant it, Lord. We ask
[1:38:02] it of thee specifically that you would
[1:38:04] bless our sister and may she be well
[1:38:06] every bit well. Lord, we take up this uh
[1:38:10] this burden that Sister Hope has for her
[1:38:12] older children. Lord God, you see how
[1:38:15] the enemy has pulled this and pulled
[1:38:17] that, but he ain't nobody, Lord. You're
[1:38:19] still God. You're still on the throne.
[1:38:22] And we still believe you, Lord God. And
[1:38:24] I pray that the Holy Spirit will go out
[1:38:27] from this service tonight, go down the
[1:38:29] road, overtake those older children, and
[1:38:32] bring them to thee, oh God. Draw them to
[1:38:34] thy w to thy wounded side as the song
[1:38:37] would seem. Say, Lord, grant it I pray.
[1:38:40] Hear the cry of this mother. Lord, may
[1:38:43] it be so tonight. Brother Enoch turns in
[1:38:45] an unspoken request, Lord. And we're
[1:38:48] praying for our Miss Alyssa tonight.
[1:38:50] That Lord God, we don't know her, but
[1:38:51] you know her quite well, Lord God,
[1:38:53] you're the one who gave her life. She
[1:38:55] couldn't have had life if it hadn't come
[1:38:57] from you. And Lord, now, no doubt the
[1:38:59] enemy is trying some tyranny. May you
[1:39:02] rebuke him, Lord. And may the blessing
[1:39:04] pass upon this woman for her need. Lord,
[1:39:06] brother Enoch has asked it with faith
[1:39:08] and we're agreeing with him and joining
[1:39:10] with him in this belief in Jesus name.
[1:39:13] Amen. Amen. Let's sing the song, Brother
[1:39:16] Tony. Amen. Sing it for us.
[1:39:19] All is well.
[1:39:23] Oh, hallelujah. Thank God it is. All is
[1:39:27] well. Thank God it is. We have heard. We
[1:39:33] have heard of the message. Shalom.
[1:39:37] Shalom. And
[1:39:41] all hallelujah, Lord. I'm glad we know
[1:39:44] it that way. There is a place, a place
[1:39:49] of
[1:39:51] birth behind
[1:39:57] me. So rest. Little
[1:40:03] ride for all. Oh, that's beautiful.
[1:40:07] Let's sing it again. Let's raise up our
[1:40:09] hands and sing it like a testimony. All
[1:40:12] is well. Let me hear you.
[1:40:18] All is well.
[1:40:22] Oh, lift up those voices. We have heard
[1:40:27] the
[1:40:29] message and all is all is well.
[1:40:35] I'm glad there's a place there. There is
[1:40:39] the place of
[1:40:42] perfect rest
[1:40:45] behind
[1:40:47] the rest.
[1:40:50] So rest little
[1:40:54] [Music]
[1:40:55] right for all his word.
[1:41:00] Any testimonies tonight before we go?
[1:41:02] Brother Luther, come ahead, my brother.
[1:41:05] Amen. There you go, my friend. He's
[1:41:06] coming up the aisle.
[1:41:11] So, um, I was working today in Hampton
[1:41:14] Hall and, um, so we go to this house.
[1:41:17] We're putting up a, uh, mounting a 75
[1:41:21] in TV on the wall. We've been in there
[1:41:24] for about an hour or so. Of course,
[1:41:26] everything kind of goes once in a while,
[1:41:29] screw strips out or whatever. So, I was
[1:41:32] just going out to get some tools out of
[1:41:34] my truck and I parked it on the side of
[1:41:36] the road. There's a
[1:41:38] security truck out there behind my truck
[1:41:42] and u they've been there for a little
[1:41:43] bit. I didn't realize it and I'm like,
[1:41:44] "What's going on?" She's getting ready
[1:41:47] to put this ticket on my windshield for
[1:41:49] $150. Oh boy. Because I didn't have
[1:41:52] cones beside my truck. And I'm just like
[1:41:56] and I was I was trying to talk to I
[1:41:57] didn't get mad or nothing. I was because
[1:41:59] I understood she wasn't I was like, "Are
[1:42:01] you kidding?" you know, I took the truck
[1:42:02] and I parked it in the driveway, you
[1:42:04] know, but that didn't make any
[1:42:06] difference. And she was the chief. She's
[1:42:08] the security chief. She said, "I already
[1:42:10] called it in and I'm just like, what?"
[1:42:12] So, we go in, finished the job, and um,
[1:42:16] of course, I'm like, 150 bucks? I didn't
[1:42:18] even make 150 bucks today. But um so the
[1:42:23] owner was in there and um so we're going
[1:42:25] out we're finishing the job and we're
[1:42:28] out there and um I'm looking at he's
[1:42:30] like so I'm looking at this ticket and I
[1:42:32] so I called the security chief which was
[1:42:34] the same woman and she's not budging at
[1:42:37] all. I says there's no gray area here.
[1:42:39] You can't give me a warning or said no
[1:42:42] it's already you want to talk to HOA. I
[1:42:44] said forget it. The owner is standing
[1:42:46] here. He's going this place is
[1:42:49] ridiculous. He's He's going to move here
[1:42:51] in a couple years, but he's getting the
[1:42:52] house ready. So he says, "Uh, do you got
[1:42:56] Venmo?" I says, "Yeah." He says, "Well,
[1:42:58] I'll venue mow you 150 bucks so that so
[1:43:02] that you don't have to pay for it." I
[1:43:03] was like, "Are you kidding?" So he did
[1:43:05] Venmo me 150 bucks and I'm not paying no
[1:43:11] fine. Amen. Praise the
[1:43:15] Lord. Anybody else got a testimony
[1:43:17] tonight before we go? Praise the Lord.
[1:43:19] That's a good one. Amen. Over here,
[1:43:20] brother Caleb.
[1:43:24] More often than not, my thoughts become
[1:43:26] reality over the pull pit. And the Lord
[1:43:30] is just knowing what I'm thinking and
[1:43:32] what I need of. And on the way over
[1:43:35] here, I was thinking about how I could
[1:43:37] be a better witness and all the
[1:43:39] potential missed opportunities that I've
[1:43:42] had just because I've not been in the
[1:43:44] right state of mind that I should have
[1:43:46] been. And I know me and you, we go to
[1:43:49] the same barber. And I was just thinking
[1:43:52] about
[1:43:53] that. And that quote came up from
[1:43:55] brother Caleb, but that was exactly what
[1:43:58] I needed. And the Lord knows. And
[1:44:01] sometimes those types of things I don't
[1:44:03] even pray about. I'm just thinking, and
[1:44:05] the Lord has blessed me and knows what I
[1:44:08] have need of. And I thank him very much.
[1:44:11] Amen. Praise the
[1:44:12] Lord.
[1:44:14] Any others tonight? Holy Ghost. Amen.
[1:44:17] Praise the Lord. Amen. Yeah, I'm exactly
[1:44:20] the same way, Brother Caleb. That meant
[1:44:23] the the world to me. And uh actually,
[1:44:26] Brother Caleb had talked about he sent
[1:44:28] it to me saying, "Brother Jason, this is
[1:44:31] um so goes with along the lines of what
[1:44:33] you've been preaching." and and I had
[1:44:36] the one that I wanted to read from um
[1:44:39] Speak to This Mountain, but that one
[1:44:40] there just was so fitting because it's
[1:44:43] it's a it's a prophet saying, "Look,
[1:44:45] here's how you do it. It's not rocket
[1:44:48] science. It's not difficult. The more
[1:44:50] you get of God, the less you'll have of
[1:44:53] the world. It'll push the world out. The
[1:44:55] more of his word that you let in, the
[1:44:57] more of intellectualism will go out. the
[1:45:00] more time you spend with him, it's and
[1:45:02] the more you empty out of the world,
[1:45:05] he'll come in and fill up that spot. I'm
[1:45:08] glad that it's that that God is that
[1:45:11] approachable and that I don't have to I
[1:45:14] don't have to go I don't have to cross
[1:45:16] the ocean or call him to go to heaven
[1:45:18] and bring him down here. He's right here
[1:45:20] among us, friends, with the answer for
[1:45:22] what we need. God bless you. God bless
[1:45:24] you. Turn around, shake hands with
[1:45:26] somebody near you. Amen. And brother
[1:45:28] Anthony sings us again. You can be
[1:45:31] dismissed in Jesus name. We'll see you
[1:45:33] this weekend. God bless you.
