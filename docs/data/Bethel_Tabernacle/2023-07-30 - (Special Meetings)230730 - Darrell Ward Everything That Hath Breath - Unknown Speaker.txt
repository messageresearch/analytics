Lord used him in such a specific way for just one individual I'm sure more all the young people were blessed but we watch something very Supernatural take place last night of the young girl's life who'd just been battling something just in those teenage years some of the hardest years um and the devil had just been battling her we came up against it even before the meeting started watching the devil already working but then the Lord sent a servant and he yielded himself to the Holy Spirit and he just went right down the exact Channel never knew nothing didn't know anything at all and just called out the spirit that had been plaguing the sister's mind last night about one o'clock in the morning we sat on these chairs just weeping and crying with her she said I'm free I'm free of it today I don't battle it anymore and we just wept with her so I just want to give the Lord a hand clap of praise for that amen amen [Applause] I haven't sang this song in a while so but that was

their heart only read from Psalms 150 this morning verse 6. I want to speak to you for just a few minutes on everything that hath breath Praise You the Lord amen well you're turning there we just certainly like to say we appreciate Brother Brad and Sister Sarah and opened it up to home and allowed us to stay and give us a nice place and a good fellowship and food and we want to thank brother Jason and his family and the church here for allowing us to come and I know for this weekend you could have had a lot of Great Men to come and minister to you and get you allowed me to come and I appreciate that and Trust something was said to touch you and help you and you know sometimes we do things uh I heard a story one time of a boy walking on the seashore and there was thousands of starfish had beached herself and he was picking them up and throwing them into the water one by one and this old fella come up and said buddy what are you doing and he said I'm saving these starfishes lives and he picked up one threw it in the water and he said Son looks said there's thousands upon thousands of starfishes you can never make a difference he picked up one and he looked at it and he threw it in the water and he said I made a difference to that one amen amen if we can make a difference for one we've not failed he would have with us we preached Friday night he would have come from glory and went to Calvary for the sake of one Soul that's just how much he loves us Psalms 150 verse 6 the Bible says this everything that hath breath praise ye the Lord everything that hath breath prays the Lord praise ye the Lord let us bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord once again we bow in your wonderful presence Lord we thank you from the depths of our heart that while we were hit sitters you loved us yes the Lord I pray this morning that this little simple message Lord It's really the only kind I can preach but Lord I pray that somehow it would speak to ever Harden to every home Lord that we would leave here dear God with this desire Lord to worship you for thou art God and you're worthy of Our Praise Lord father I pray for those that would maybe be down today and Lord when the service comes to an end may they be lifted up and those Lord that would be sick may they be healed and Lord those who've never known you may they find that personal relationship with you today Lord those that need a Revival a stirring whatever it would be Lord when we leave the building May every need be met we ask you for this Lord because we believe you're able to do it dear God we ask for brother Jason in the the ministering team here and the officers of the church dear God that you just bless them in a great way and use their Ministries Lord that it may touch the lives here in Beaufort South Carolina Lord that it be a witness that you're the same yesterday today and forever and thank you Lord for these young people who's come and took their time and other May there not be a one missing on that day when we all gather into our Daddy's house until then Lord let us labor we commit this service into your hands For Your Glory for we ask it in Jesus name and the bride says may God bless you who may be seated forgive me for crying a little bit but I've just told the young people I believe God squeezes a man's heart and the juice comes out his eyes I'm just so glad he can still squeeze my heart that everything that hath breath praised the Lord praise ye the Lord the prophet of God says this he says have you ever noticed how the world gets into the spirit of the things that are in the world they go to their ball games and their sporting events and their dances and they interacted to the spirit of it they don't sit there like a wildfire like old dried up sticks but they enter right into the field of things and become a part of things but all how they hate Christians for getting into the spirit of God's word they call us Fanatics Holy Rollers there's nothing that they won't do to show their hatred and their disapproval well brother now what are we going to do about that you know we're living in a time that everybody wants to be politically correct and we you know we don't want to hurt nobody's feelings and so you know if they don't want us to get loud if they don't want us to worship God then then maybe we should just kind of sit quiet because we don't want to offend anybody you think that's what we should do well here's what the prophet said to do he said there's nothing they won't do to show their hatred and disapproval but he said but ignore that you can expect it knowing where it's coming from just go on and get into the spirit of worship our spirit is clean it's fresh it's real it's sober it's serious but nonetheless it's full of the joy of the Lord the Christian ought to be just exuberant and full of his pleasure in the Lord as the world is when it Savers and delights in its Pleasures both Christians and the world are human we're human and both have emotions well brother Daryl I'm just not very an emotional person that's simply not true [Music] and to prove that you hit your little toe on the way to the bathroom about one o'clock in the morning and everybody in the house knows you hit your little toe you will become you know that's the truth you kiss it if you could get it up to your mouth amen we're both human we both made myself laugh we both have emotions but the difference is the Christian's heart oh I love this right here the Christian's heart and emotions are purely on The Lord Of Glory and his love while the world satisfies the flesh while the world satisfies the flesh their emotions is to satisfy the flesh I'm not here to satisfy the flesh I'm here to satisfy the one who created me amen and I'm not talking about you know I'm not talking about the something that would that would work on our emotions something that would glorify the flesh but I'm talking about just loving to love God what's wrong with just loving to love God amen just thank him and love him and rejoice because I want you to know this morning there is no God like our God I said there is no God like our God Hallelujah you know the devil's going to try to tell you now be careful now you're going to get in the flesh and you ain't worried about getting in the flesh I want to get out of it hey man you're going to be a fanatic or or if you praise God before there's one sign of healing there then you're lying because you're still you're still you're you're still sick so if you start testifying of your healing and you still got a symptom you're lying because you're still sick that's what the devil will try to tell you to do what you completely well and then give God praise but that's not what the Bible teaches amen so if you praise God for your healing and you still got a symptom you're lying because you're still really sick but let us be like Joshua look at Joshua where the Prophet said before one rock ever came out of the building of the walls of Jericho Joshua walked around the walls shouting the victory for by faith he saw the victory now when I was in the army they gave me a still pot for combat they gave me combat boots they gave me an M16 rifle with a banana clip that held 18 rounds if I remember right and then they gave me underneath the M16 they gave me an m203 which was a grenade launcher now the reason they done that was because I was on the rifle range and when I was on the rifle ranges shot a couple of times the sergeant said you'll be the 203 man you'll be the grenade launcher you don't have to be accurate just close so the whole time I was in the Army I carried an m203 grenade launcher I was on a 155 Hauser that fired a 105 pound projectile 18 miles on a Max charge of a green bag I know you don't know what that is but that's what I was on so they gave me all this stuff to defend my country but there's one thing the Army never gave me you know what it was the promise of a victory they just said here's the tools fight the best that you can fight but when I got into God's Army he gave me a helmet of salvation Oh Glory to God he saw in my feet with the preparation of the Gospel he gave me the sword of the word and the shield of faith and the breastplate of righteousness but God gave me something else that the United States Army never gave me he gave me the promise of a victory Hallelujah he said you've already won look at the back of the book in your hardest day in your greatest battle remember we have already won listen I may lose a battle now and then but we've already won the war Hallelujah know that the walls are coming down and he earned his men and walked around and around Jericho for seven days full of armor if doing what because he was looking at the Unseen it was a promise that God made how much the prophet said can you walk around that wheelchair how much can you walk around that cancer how much can you walk around that sin shouting the victory Hallelujah shouting the victory that God's give the promise when you can see him who he is invisible when the pulsation comes into your heart and begins to pulsate I'm the Lord thy God who heals all thy diseases when you can see that everything else weakens away amen when you see the promise of God's word and God's word cannot fail then the symptoms don't matter the pain don't matter that's not what the Bible said he said I'm the Lord thy God who healeth all thy diseases amen Hallelujah when the pulsation comes into your heart and it begins to pulse like I'm the Lord thy God who heal us all that diseases when you can see that by faith everything else weakens away I can rejoice in my healing because the word says I'm Healed I can rejoice in my Deliverance because the word says I've delivered and God Don't Lie God does not lie can I get a witness don't wait for signs and wonders well I'm waiting till somebody see something I'm waiting for a vision don't wait for signs and wonders take God at his word prophecies will fail come on somebody Visions will fail but the word of God will never fail to us it'll never fail us amen oh my don't wait for signs and wonders take God at his word and start rejoicing saying it's going to happen because God said so he said I believe if every patient in this building right now would accept it upon the grounds of God's word and believe it and start testifying and praising God for your healing the meeting would not close with one crippled person in here not if we have the prayer line come on somebody not if somebody discerns our hearts but if we'll simply take God at his word and begin to praise him and thank him for being a Healer our deliverer our sustainer Hallelujah something will take place and not a feeble person will be in the building and I say why not us why not this morning somebody's going to fulfill this quote somebody's going to manifest it why not us right now God is under obligation to answer his word here several years ago I know you some of you probably heard this but it has come to my mind I was in Romania there's a young Romanian girl was born without a hip she walked on a crutch in which she walked her leg just swung because there was nothing there it just kind of swung as she'd stop walking she'd have to take her her hand and stuff her leg for moving and brother Kenny Capps was preaching the morning services and I had the evening it's on a Friday night she come to the Altar and she wanted to give her heart to the Lord and so she tried to work that leg to get down on her knees and repeat and I thought my God how many people in America have two good legs and will never Bend to the Lord and I told her I said sis you don't have to do that right here right now where you're standing you can accept Christ but she didn't want to do that she wanted to get on her knees and repent and she worked that leg till she got down and repented of her sins Saturday morning after the service they had a baptism and I watched that girl go into the river with the crunch to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ that night Saturday night she come back to the altar and she said I want God to heal me she said I want to have a husband I want to have children who would marry me like this lovely young girl and I said sis you know what I do if I was you I said I quit asking God to heal me and I start thanking him yeah I said just get up in the morning write it on your mirror thank God for healing my hip I said every time you go to church stand up and testify thank God for healing and I said you take this handkerchief and when God heals you you send it back to me for a testimony of what the Lord did for you two and a half three years went by I get this email said brother Daryl so I've been trying to find you said my name's Christina didn't even know the girl's name she said I did what she told me to do brother Daryl I went everywhere testifying all the young people's meetings I stood up and testified thank God for healing my hip so they got so bad that my mom and daddy said you need to quit testifying you ain't no better you need to quit but she said I didn't do that brother I didn't quit I kept testifying of my healing I said it got to the place that even my friends were making fun of me come on and she said I stood up in a meeting brother Daryl and I said I want to thank God for healing my hip and said I heard one of my friends say here she goes again she said brother now when I said that I want to thank God for healing my ear she said my hair popped and I threw the clutch down and I walked out of the building Hallelujah doing what thanking God for her healing before it ever happened she was thanking God for healing her Hallelujah I was up at the byc a few years ago and a brother came up to me from Romania he said brother do you know a girl named Christina I said oh yeah I said isn't it lovely what the Lord did for her he said brother I was in that meeting he said I watched her leg grow out the power of the God we serve this water her brother I've got a big problem huh you got a big God um amen who are not us friends when is the quotes when's the quote you know the prophet of God said can I just take my time this morning the prophet of God said that it will come to pass in the last days that men will be more like women and women will be more like men that ain't a quote that's a reality well if that quote has become a reality why can't this quote be a reality is that not true for his if the prophet said that that same Prophet said this that if we start praising God and thanking him for his healing he said there wouldn't be a feeble one among us before the service come to an end I say yeah Lord let that be Me Lord Hallelujah God told Paul he's going to Rome and on the way to Rome he was Shipwrecked and on an island and he got bit by a deadly snake and the people said he's a dead man they didn't even call 9-1-1 they just sat down to watch him die but Paul had a word of the Lord not an emotion not a sensation he simply had a promise of God you must go to Rome so what did Paul do Paul took the word of God over the symptom of a deadly snake bite because Paul said how can I go to Rome and die from a statement so what did he do he took what God Said over what the natives of the island were saying because they were saying you're a dead man Paul they even said this man must have done something terrible wrong to escape the sea and die by the snake he must be a real deceiver he must be really evil but when he didn't die you know what they said they said this man ain't a deceiver he's a god and what did Paul do he had the word of the Lord over the poison snake he had a promise from God concerning this promise of that you're going to Rome so he took the word over the poison of the snake he just pitched it over into the fire and listen to me young people if the Satan at one of his serpents tries to latch on to you with lust or with deceit or with fear or with oppression just do like Paul did just bitching over into the fire and keep on going if he tries to hold you back if he tries to tell you you didn't get nothing if he tries to bite you just him over into the fire and keep on going amen Hallelujah do you love him this morning amen I tell you well brother I'll tell you if I was healthy I'd praise God if I had no worries I'd praise God if I had no money problems I'd praise God well that's that's wonderful that might be all right but you see the only problem of that is the Bible doesn't say that the Bible says let everything that hath breath praise ye the Lord let the sad man let the happy man let the poor man let the rich man let the sick man let the Healthy Man let the man on the mountain let the man that's in the valley let everything that have breath praise ye the Lord Hallelujah will Donald is there any reason I can't get whether I'm glad you said that there is a reason if you don't want to praise the Lord there is one reason in the Bible one excuse in the Bible for not praising God so if you want it this morning I'll give it to you some of you don't want to praise God you want an excuse not to praise him I have one so I'll give it to you this morning you can write it down put it on the refrigerator the Bible says this in Psalms 115 17 the dead prays not the Lord so if you're dead this morning you're excused but if you ain't dead the Bible God the Bible said let everything that hath breath praise ye the Lord listen to me I've come for one purpose this morning I've come not to complain I didn't come to find thought I didn't come to sleep I didn't come to sit on the service but I'm like those Majors they said we've seen his story in the East and for two years they journeyed through the desert through swamps through valleys through mountains but they come for one purpose they said we have come to worship him we may have fought all hell to get here this morning but you're here and while we're here we might as well give the devil a black eye we might as well let the devil know whose side we're on you need to let the devil know when you come through that door I'm not on your side I'm on God's side this morning I've come to

you you know why because you see God placed you here God chose to put you in such a time as this and he never put you here to fail he never put come on somebody he put you here because he knew that

on somebody he never put you here to fail he put you here he could have put you in Jesus day Luther's day Wesley's day but he put you in this day because he knew you could overcome [Applause] and we are sitting here this morning in Heavenly places with every devil under our feet I didn't know brother Matt was going to sing at I was setting a study before the service started and wrote it down I've got it right here just a little note right here every devil under your feet he said brother I'm a nobody but God takes nobody to make somebody's out of them it's a body move it's a body move we need each other you young people need each other don't talk about one another don't make fun of one another don't put one another out don't draw a circle and leave somebody out if somebody's out draw a bigger Circle put them in you need each other Hey listen I may not be the eyebrow in the body I may not be the eye or the ear or the you know I may be the skin under the little toe and I'll tell you right now I got an ugly little toe but you know if I'm the skin underneath my little toe in the body of Christ if I'm that little piece of skin that's under the little toe guess what every devil look down at your feet this morning everybody look down your feet this morning you see your feet you know what's under them you know what's under your feet I ain't talking about the carpet you know what's under your feet every devil is under your feet years ago when my daughter Ali was little I was preaching up in Kentucky and we're standing outside after the service talking to the Brother Ali is standing beside me she's about like this right here and I was trying to talk to the brother and now he goes I said I said something well it was good to be here this weekend she goes and I said something else she goes I said Ali what are you you're destroying my Ministry what are you doing I said Ali what are you doing she said it's a bug Daddy it's a bug and I look down this little bug it was running around it's just trying to stomp it oh you know what this morning friends the devil ain't nothing but a bug and what you need to do when he tries to raise up his head you need to stomp it down Hallelujah you need to stomp him down you need to tell him I'm the boss around here you have no control over me but I have control over you your back was broken Calvary amen I'm not going down I'm not defeated I have the victory this morning [Applause] Jeremiah said Heal Me O Lord and I shall be healed save me and I shall be saved for thou art my praise if I'm going to use my breath let me use it to praise him not to talk about my problems but let me use it to exalt him to lift up his name listen to me I don't care how you feeling right now just raise your hand and say praise God praise God [Applause] oh don't that feel good he's worthy of it well brother I didn't feel nothing he never said did you feel it he said did you believe it Hallelujah can I have a few more listen violence shall no more be heard in thy land wasting nor destruction within thy borders but thy shall call thy walls salvation and thy Gates praise that shall cause thy Gates praise call thy Gates praise now Gates do two things it keeps things out and it lets things in it's an entrance and it's a blockade and as the song says when you seem like you're all alone praise His name when you feel you can't go on just raise your hand and say greater is he that is within me and you can praise the hurt away if you'll just praise His name oh Hallelujah let your praise be an entrance into his let your praise be in interest into his presence for the Bible said our God inhabits the praise of Israel he inhabits the praise of his people when your back's against the wall and it seems like there's no way through and Satan has you cut off let me tell you something this morning young people you've got a gate of praise and you can hang that gate of Praise Hallelujah and step right through that gate into the presence of the God who created you and when you begin to give him praise when you begin to lift up his name it just does something to you my daughter struck by the train 's Daddy and sister was killed in that accident brother Jason come to the hospital in July prayed for her wishes on life support and I took my little girl she's only two years and nine months something like that she had a she had all kinds of tubes all in her body feeding tube in her stomach couldn't swallow it had a chair there in the room and I'd take my little girl when she'd come off the life support the doctors told me if she even lived she'd be nothing but a vegetable and I'd put her in my arms and I'd sit there in that rocking chair and I'd sing in moments like this I sing out a song I sing out a love song to Jesus in moments like this I lift up my eyes I lift up my hands to the Lord and the Lord raised her up and when we came home from the hospital she could walk she could talk she could see and we came home with Jesus I said it on the couch and I got her up in my arms you know what I did I began to sing in moments like this that's right the situation the moments doesn't change who he is it doesn't change the price that's in our hearts [Applause] because the Bible says no matter what happens to us all things work to the good we may not understand it but sometimes they don't ask us to understand he just says can you trust me I think of Paul is Silas it was in prison they were cold they were hungry sore beaten bloody chained I see Silas you know they beat him unconscious just throw them into the prison cells Paul and one maybe Silas in the other Silas begins this third kind of don't even know where he's at last time you remember is Paul so he goes Paul hears his name he kind of wakes up he said I'm over here Silas he said Paula I thought they was going to kill us today I didn't think there's ever gonna quit beating on us what are we gonna do Paul what are we going to do yeah we're cold we're hungry we're in jail we're beaten we're bloody we're bruised what are we gonna do Paul said you know this looks like a good place to have church give me a c for Christ I'm one of them I'm one of them I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them I'm one of them I'm one of them I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them and about that time they walked up somebody down in the cell today we don't want none of that around here you set quiet if you got something to say if you think it's good just nod your head just raise two fingers that means Hallelujah and a nod is an amen we don't want none of that around here oh my Lord Paul well we offended that guy what are we going to do Paul said sing louder sing louder amen and they begin to sing again I'm one of them I'm one of them you know there's something about family Harmony you know Paul being the church age messenger no doubt he's saying lead Silas maybe Hawaii I don't know but we'll say he's saying tenor and God was watching in heaven he said hahaha Gabriel come here come here Gabriel look right down there go see my Lord what is that he said look he said that's Paul and Silas said Paul yeah that's Paul and that's Silas said look they're cold they're hungry they're beaten they're bruised they're in jail Warren wood come here look right down there they're cold they're hungry they're beaten they're in jail that's Paul and Silas they looked over it God said what are you going to do God said you know I think I'll just go down and join them so Paul sung lead Silas Sun tenor but God Sang Bass and when God came down with that deep Thunder's voice of his like the Roar of the lion Hallelujah when he would come down there and he began to sing in that Harmony oh my that deep voice you heard some of these guys with this bass at you coming down you can hear them 10 miles away boom boom boom boom everything in our house that's the way it was with God hallelujah he came down there he began to sing that bass and the prison began Hallelujah the walls begin to shake and the bars come open and God said you won't come to praise me you want to praise me I've come to receive your praise he's good this morning to receive your praise amen yeah Hallelujah in prison changed with bleeding Stripes Paul and Silas prayed that night and in their pain begin to sing their chains were loosed and they were free I bless your name I bless your name I give you honor I give you praise you are the life the truth the way I bless your name I bless your name some Midnight Hour if you should find you're in a prison in your mind reach out and praise defy those chains and they will fall in Jesus name so we will go I was in a meeting there's a young girl there she's a cutter she had all these scars on her arms when she cut herself this particular meeting the Lord began to move among the people in a great way and she said she testified of this later she said I thought Lord I Want To Praise You I want to lift my hands so much and praise you she said but I'm ashamed of these scars I don't nobody see all these scars on my arms he said a boy spoke to her and said raise your arms and give me praise and she said brother Darryl when I raise my arms to praise God the scars disappeared off of my arms that's the kind of God we serve friends Hallelujah come on somebody there is there is nothing that my God cannot do you got scars in your life why don't you just praise him why don't you just let it go why don't you just give it up and give God the praise you're still here you're still battling you're still pressing on Don't Let The Devil hinder you don't let the Devils slow you down give God praise he kept us in the midst of the fire he'll keep us in the Lion's Den Our God will keep us we will Hallelujah we will not fail but we shall overcome hey [Applause] oh thank you Jesus who I'm getting old no not only his gate for an entrance it's also a defense for keeping things out listen to this quote thanks be to God you believe you believe me to be a servant You Must Believe now sister because you realize your condition you've got cancer you're not going to live long unless God touches you isn't that right come here my sister kind heavenly father let thy mercies be shown unto the woman may she go from here tonight normally and well I condemn this enemy with this church and these believing people in the name of Jesus Christ may it leave her amen God bless you Sister go happy now rejoicing go happy now rejoice in thanking God just believe it's gone from you now but when it goes out it'll come back again but if you just keep saying Thank You Lord if you just keep on rejoicing it can't come back on you then it'll go out but it'll try to come back it'll try to it's like I was telling the brothers they come you know for prayer you stand up God instantly heals you of back trouble you say my God I'm Healed there's no pain nowhere and out in the parking lot you're testifying of it you go to work you're testified of it Monday no pain Tuesday absolutely no pain oh my you're just going down the road just whistling singing you get up Wednesday morning you can't hardly get out of bed you go to roll over the pain shooting down your legs do you know what that means absolutely nothing Hallelujah we're not healed because we feel like it we're healed because the word says we're healed praise God your praise to God is a defense against Satan oh let me hurry think about it how it must please God that while we are yet in trouble we begin to give God praise oh let not the oppressed return to shame let the poor and the needy praise thy name now wait till you're fully recovered not wait till you're fully delivered but while you're yet poor while you're yet in need we can still praise His name we can still exalt him we can give God praise in the morning in the noontime in the evening time praise him on the way to work praise it when you go to bed praise it when you hold my you can praise him anytime anywhere he's worthy of Our Praise we can Praise Him in the good times we can Praise Him in the bad times tell me what Satan's going to do what do you think he's going to do if every time he punches you you praise the God who defeated him [Music] saying go praise God that's not what I expected every time he punches you you praise God [Music] The God Who defeated him don't look to your symptoms look to your God if anybody ever had symptoms it was Jonah my God he was in a whale's belly can you imagine the smell and only that he was in the bottom of the ocean but did he quit did he collapse in despair no he began to give God praise that's well swallowed you know verse said when a fish eats it goes right to the bottom of the Fishbowl and that fish he saw Joan out there in that water he was a that was a Happy Meal right there six foot 220. and that was good I wouldn't mind having another one of them and he goes down to the bottom of the ocean he's just sitting there just but Jonah is in his Wells Building can you imagine the smell hubcaps boots and everything else that he swallowed besides that the acid burning his eyes stomach acid it's probably the whitest man in the country when he came out but he's down there in the mid in this whale's belly in the bottom of the ocean and he begins to praise God I give you Thanksgiving I Cried unto the Lord and he began to worship God that fish is stuck and Jonah began to worship God he goes well John began to worship to go walk oh my God I don't feel too good you don't begin to worship God again that will said oh my god I've swallowed a Holy Roller I gotta get rid of this guy I've got to get rid of this guy let me tell you something oh you start praising God Satan will get you off of his head I don't want none of that boy right there every time I smite him he Praises God that much more better watch him devil number one better watch him Devil Number Two they said that boy's crazy he's lost his mind yes we have we got the mind of Christ we know what he wants done with his word and we're not afraid to speak it foreign by the reason of my Affliction unto the Lord and he heard me out of the belly of Hell cried out and thou hurtest my voice the symptoms never silenced his voice right in the midst of his trial he started praising God I will sacrifice unto thee the voice of Thanksgiving I will pay that which I have vowed salvation is of the Lord and the Lord spake to the fish and the fish vomited out Jonah on dry ground you're talking about an Uber driver that was some Uber driver listen to me can I have just a couple more minutes I'll close but listen listen if praise can deliver a man from the belly of a whale can it not deliver you from the gloom and the Doom anybody here ever been swallowed by a will if God was able to deliver that man who swallowed cannot he deliver you remember said now go on your road rejoice and just start praising God saying thank you dear God thank you dear God and all that gloomy feeling will be gone you know you get if you get the Blues I don't know I'm just a just start praising God likes to be worshiped it isn't just exactly singing a song as we do but it's singing in the spirit of worship you see then you feel the Holy Spirit bounce back God likes to be worshiped by his children so if God likes to be worshiped I say let's make God happy he said now brother do you have any Scripture thank you I appreciate you asking that if you want scripture the people are supposed to come to the house of God for one purpose and that's to worship to sing songs to worship God that's the way God expects it he doesn't expect us to come into the house of God to talk about something or someone else or talk about one another or talk about what we've got to do through the week he expects us to come to worship Him it's his house of worship praise ye the Lord sing unto the Lord a new song Praise Him in the congregation of the Saints let Israel rejoice in him that made him let the children of Zion be joyful in their King let them praise His name and dance let them sing praises unto him with the timbrel and the harp for the lord taketh

ago I probably put oh my I must have put 20 30 quotes up here nothing but brother Branham saying now you thank him and he'll let you get well now go from here thanking him now don't doubt just start

you that's top secret Intel the devil don't want you to know but you know it today Hallelujah Oh Glory to God my I don't know if you've ever heard of the of the doctrine it's a false teaching called secession and John McArthur in different ones and they claim that you know there's no more working of the Holy Ghost in the church all the gifts are done and all there's no more Apostles no prophets and no gifts and all of that all we have is dry formal teaching I just thought you poor unfortunate soul and then I heard a Paul Washer who I admire quite a bit more than sir but but he but he's saying you know he said I I'm not all I'm not a I'm not a hard uh you know on this whole thing of secession he's just simply saying I just am saying I don't see it anymore in the modern day I could never read God's word and say it doesn't it's not there he said I just don't see it anymore and I thought and you've got a global Ministry I'd unseen the signs and wonders and God's gifts moving in this just in this weekend I say come and see oh Hallelujah come and see when the seals are open the living creature said come and see wow friends we've seen the gifts of healing we've seen the gifts

different things in a moment miraculously no there was even no thunder and lightning just the Lord said okay it's done and it was done that's it's God's not complicated thank you thank God that that's not complicated my you don't need a PhD uh you probably just go further away from God with that but I'm glad we have a simple gospel with simple faith in all it takes is for you to receive it I believe that more and more every day I live my I I was telling I had a sister come up with cataracts and a prayer line about about a year and a half ago and I just said to her what brother Daryl said

wanted me to tell you those cataracts at this point are half gone and they're going and going and going I said you tell her keep claiming it keep claiming it keep claiming it your word has creative power if you if brother Brandon said if you let a son or daughter of God take the word of God put it on their lips and speak it he said that is the same as God speaking that's deity speaking do you believe that oh my I thought about as brother Daryl was preaching and I'm not going to preach after the preacher well I'd sure like to but I thought about Shadrach Meshach and Abednego and that's the
