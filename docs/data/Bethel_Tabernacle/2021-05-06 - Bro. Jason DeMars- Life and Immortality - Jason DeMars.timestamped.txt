[30:44] let's uh let's just go to our opening
[30:46] scripture
[30:47] first timothy thank you excuse me second
[30:50] timothy
[30:52] chapter one and my topic tonight is
[30:54] gonna be life and immortality
[30:58] second timothy one verse nine and
[31:02] ten who has saved us
[31:05] and called us with the holy calling not
[31:08] according to our works but according to
[31:10] his own
[31:11] purpose and grace which was given us
[31:14] in christ jesus before the world
[31:17] began amen but is now
[31:21] made manifest by the appearing of our
[31:24] savior jesus christ who has abolished
[31:26] death
[31:27] and has brought life and immortality to
[31:30] light
[31:30] through the gospel amen may the lord add
[31:33] the blessing to the reading of his word
[31:35] you can be seated
[31:42] god is so good to us isn't he amen even
[31:45] even
[31:46] when it looks like things are very
[31:49] difficult and troubleless
[31:53] um he's good to us and uh he blesses us
[31:57] in so many ways sometimes he blesses us
[31:59] with
[32:00] difficulties trials
[32:03] and that causes us to grow amen
[32:07] i'm so thankful for how the lord is
[32:09] working in different lives and seeing
[32:11] seeing different ones that have come
[32:12] through great
[32:14] difficulties and trials and and now on
[32:17] the other side with health and strength
[32:19] and
[32:20] god is so good
[32:23] in each each and every step so don't
[32:26] don't lose hope don't grow weary
[32:31] continue walking forward regardless of
[32:34] the difficulty we've
[32:35] i've been doing a devotional with the
[32:38] the girls
[32:38] at night and we've been reading about
[32:41] the life of
[32:42] adenairem judson the missionary first
[32:45] first foreign missionary sent from
[32:48] america
[32:49] in the early 1800s and he went to
[32:52] burma and you want to talk about
[32:55] suffering
[32:56] and trials and difficulties it would it
[32:59] makes job look
[33:00] very simple the difficulty that
[33:03] ad and ireland judson faced and got god
[33:06] kept him through it
[33:08] brought him through it and through all
[33:09] the unbelievable heartaches
[33:12] and trials there's there's message
[33:15] believers in burma
[33:17] today somebody cleared the path
[33:21] so that i mean he might was it hard work
[33:25] for him clearing the if you ever get a
[33:26] chance to
[33:27] read about the life of adni judson take
[33:29] the tax the opportunity to
[33:33] it's a great blessing raise your kids up
[33:36] on mission
[33:36] missionaries and missions work
[33:40] feed their hearts and minds with that i
[33:42] believe that's that'll be a blessing to
[33:43] them and
[33:45] years to come if the lord would tarry
[33:47] but looking at our topic
[33:50] i'm really going to be looking at um
[33:52] life and immortality
[33:54] and death and destruction so it's going
[33:57] to be a real
[33:58] more like a typical teaching
[34:01] uh than than looking at it as an
[34:04] evangelistic or
[34:06] an encouragement but we're going to look
[34:09] at what is the punishment for sin
[34:13] we're going to look at the gift that god
[34:16] gives to us which is eternal life
[34:18] so when god placed adam and eve there in
[34:22] in the garden in the beginning he gave
[34:26] them a commandment genesis 2
[34:28] verses 16 and 17
[34:32] and the lord god commanded the man
[34:34] saying of every tree of the garden thou
[34:36] mayest freely eat
[34:37] but of the tree of the knowledge of good
[34:39] and evil thou shalt not eat of it for in
[34:42] the day that thou eat us thereof
[34:44] thou shalt surely die we're not gonna
[34:46] get into
[34:47] serpent seed on this one we may and if
[34:50] if this continues for part two part
[34:51] three how many other parts
[34:53] we may get into that further so uh
[34:56] just taking this at at the basic value
[34:59] face value of what it's saying is
[35:02] when you eat it the punishment
[35:05] for disobedience will be death
[35:10] so again adam was created as an immortal
[35:14] being he was made in the image and
[35:16] likeness of god
[35:18] he was a part of god that came out of
[35:21] god and that was eventually put
[35:23] in to human flesh in genesis chapter two
[35:27] okay and so he by he he by default
[35:31] had immortality but what was the
[35:34] punishment
[35:35] that he was to receive if he disobeyed
[35:39] death so now
[35:43] he is subject to death from eating
[35:47] from that tree of knowledge of good and
[35:48] evil he is subject to death god does not
[35:51] say the punishment for sin
[35:53] is eternal conscious torment
[35:56] in a burning hell right it says it's
[36:00] death so adam
[36:04] and eve both ate of that tree of
[36:05] knowledge of good and evil
[36:07] this resulted not only in death for them
[36:11] but inherited death and not only
[36:14] inherited death
[36:15] for all their their seed but an
[36:18] inherited
[36:19] sin nature for the human race
[36:24] and so when as in adam all die
[36:28] amen but that's not the end of the story
[36:30] even so
[36:31] all in christ shall be made alive
[36:36] so we read through the revelation of
[36:38] scriptures of course we do learn
[36:40] there is a place of punishment but that
[36:43] never replaces that the final punishment
[36:45] of sin is ultimately
[36:47] death so the
[36:50] the picture that the orthodox
[36:52] theological world gives you is that all
[36:54] souls are immortal
[36:57] they'll be they'll be around for all of
[36:59] eternity
[37:00] the soul will either go to hell in
[37:02] conscious torment
[37:04] for eternity or the soul will go to
[37:07] paradise
[37:08] for all eternity but
[37:11] this is not the picture the scripture
[37:13] gives
[37:15] so let's look at these
[37:19] these words immortal or incorruptible
[37:23] in the new testament so there's two
[37:26] different words
[37:27] in the greek new testament that are
[37:29] translated as immortal
[37:32] and so we'll look at these these words
[37:34] romans 2 verse 7.
[37:41] this word is aphtharsia which means
[37:44] incorruptibility which basically means
[37:46] unending
[37:48] existence so romans 2
[37:51] 7 to them who by patient continuance in
[37:54] well-doing
[37:56] seek for glory and honor and immortality
[38:00] eternal life so
[38:04] we have to seek for
[38:08] immortality eternal life
[38:11] it's not the default that we have
[38:15] eternal life but we have to seek for
[38:19] eternal life first corinthians 15.
[38:32] verse 53
[38:39] so this is the same word that was
[38:41] translated as immortality in romans 2 7.
[38:44] for this corruptable must put on in
[38:46] corruption
[38:48] and this mortal must put on immortality
[38:50] so you see in this verse
[38:51] it's using bo both of the words that are
[38:54] translated as
[38:55] immortal one is referring to
[38:58] incorruption and one is referring to
[39:00] obviously immortality
[39:03] so again for this corruptable
[39:07] must put on incorruption what is he
[39:09] talking about every single person
[39:11] that was born no he's talking about
[39:15] believers now again don't get mixed up
[39:18] and
[39:18] and and start relating this back to
[39:20] predestination it says
[39:22] i always had eternal life that's
[39:24] absolutely true but we also understand
[39:26] isn't it a gift it's called a gift
[39:30] we're given to it we're born under
[39:32] condemnation to sin
[39:34] now god in his mind in his in his
[39:36] eternal plan
[39:38] knew that you would be you would be
[39:40] saved
[39:41] and that you would enter into
[39:42] immortality but you're born
[39:45] under the condemnation of death
[39:49] that's why we need a savior that's why
[39:50] we need to be converted
[39:52] it isn't that just god god chose who was
[39:55] going to be
[39:56] saved and it doesn't matter what happens
[39:57] in this life remember
[39:59] paul said you have to seek for
[40:02] glory and honor and immortality
[40:06] right so it's what what am i saying i'm
[40:09] saying that
[40:10] it is a gift it's a free gift our
[40:12] salvation
[40:13] is a gift god ordained us to
[40:17] salvation as we read in the opening
[40:19] scripture
[40:21] it was it was fixed that we would be
[40:23] saved before the foundation of the world
[40:25] that's absolutely true and yet we are
[40:28] still
[40:28] born in sin shaped in iniquity with the
[40:32] condemnation of death
[40:33] upon us and we still have it
[40:37] if we don't go in the rapture we'll
[40:39] still die
[40:40] physically speaking right and we'll but
[40:43] we'll be raised up that's what the
[40:45] promise for this corruptible
[40:47] our body that's our body now this
[40:49] corruptible you and me our bodies right
[40:51] now
[40:52] are corruptable in other words we're
[40:54] subject to death
[40:57] and decay so this
[41:00] body will it gets older
[41:03] it gets weaker not like brother luther
[41:06] his he just keeps getting stronger
[41:08] seems like but for me i keep getting
[41:12] weaker
[41:16] and and the reality is we're decaying
[41:19] that's
[41:19] what's happening and it's our body this
[41:22] is a body that's corrupt
[41:24] and so this body if if we're alive and
[41:27] remain
[41:28] this body will be changed in a moment in
[41:30] the twinkling of an eye
[41:32] if we're not it'll fall on the ground
[41:34] and corrupt and decay
[41:36] very quickly but god will take that same
[41:39] those molecules and we'll change them
[41:43] and raise them up and turn that into an
[41:46] incorruptible
[41:47] body and that is his gift
[41:50] that means it's not it's it's an
[41:52] unearned
[41:54] thing it's not something that we deserve
[41:56] it's not a payment
[41:57] it's his it's his free grace that he
[42:01] gives to us
[42:02] the gift of eternal life
[42:07] we are predestinated to it we do have it
[42:09] of course
[42:10] understand but we have to go through the
[42:13] process
[42:14] of salvation first corinthians
[42:18] uh next verse 54
[42:21] so when this corruptable shall have put
[42:23] on in corruption
[42:25] and this mortal shall have put on
[42:27] immortality
[42:29] then shall be brought to pass the saying
[42:31] that is written death is swallowed up
[42:33] in victory and then
[42:37] skip back two verses to verse 52
[42:40] which we just referred to in a moment in
[42:42] the twinkling of an eye at the last
[42:44] trump for the trumpet shall sound
[42:46] and the dead shall be raised
[42:48] incorruptible
[42:49] and we shall be changed
[42:53] one more place this word is used in the
[42:56] new testament
[42:56] first peter 1 verse 4
[43:02] to an inheritance incorruptible
[43:05] and undefiled that fadeth not away
[43:08] reserved in heaven
[43:09] for you r
[43:13] it's an it's an inheritance
[43:16] that cannot die that cannot be
[43:20] decayed that is
[43:23] not you it can't be killed right
[43:27] amen all right then
[43:30] there's a different word used first
[43:32] peter 1
[43:34] verse 23. we did read another one where
[43:37] it is also used in
[43:38] first corinthians 15 53 but we're just
[43:42] going to look at first peter 1 23.
[43:45] this is the word epithardos which means
[43:47] undecaying
[43:50] so first peter 1 23 says being born
[43:52] again
[43:54] not of corruptible seed but of
[43:57] incorruptible by the word of god which
[43:59] lives
[44:00] and abides forever now these are all the
[44:03] places where
[44:04] immortal is used in the greek new
[44:07] testament
[44:09] are any of them used to refer
[44:13] to the state of a condemned sinner
[44:17] that they have an immortal soul that
[44:20] they will
[44:21] live for all eternity in conscious
[44:23] torment
[44:25] not one single place all of them are
[44:28] used in reference to the state
[44:30] of a believer when the rapture and
[44:33] resurrection
[44:34] of the saints takes place
[44:37] so it's the immortality what is being
[44:40] spoken of is not even speaking
[44:42] necessarily of the soul
[44:44] it's speaking of the whole being
[44:48] the body soul and spirit altogether
[44:51] will be raised up immortal
[44:55] or be changed and so this is
[44:58] a gift of god it is not the default
[45:02] of the human race we are born by default
[45:05] to corruption
[45:06] and death amen
[45:10] so first timothy 6 16.
[45:23] who alone who only this word only means
[45:26] soul
[45:26] single alone who only hath immortality
[45:31] dwelling in the light which no man can
[45:33] approach unto whom no man has seen
[45:35] nor can see to whom be honor and power
[45:38] everlasting amen so god
[45:41] alone the great eternal spirit
[45:45] is immortal no one else
[45:48] is immortal because why it says he alone
[45:54] soul single alone
[45:57] is immortal all right
[46:00] john 5 26
[46:11] for as the father hath life in himself
[46:16] so hath he given to the son to have life
[46:20] in himself so this father is the source
[46:25] of life now he's put that life
[46:29] in his son all right
[46:32] then first john chapter 5 verse 12
[46:41] he that hath the son hath life and he
[46:44] that hath not the son of god
[46:46] hath not life amen so that
[46:50] immortality is placed in the son of god
[46:54] and then we being in christ
[46:58] we receive that life through christ
[47:05] so god being alone immortal passing that
[47:08] life
[47:08] down to his family
[47:14] first corinthians 1 30 but of him are ye
[47:17] in christ jesus
[47:18] who of god has made unto us wisdom and
[47:21] righteousness and sanctification
[47:23] and redemption
[47:29] amen so we were when were we chosen in
[47:32] christ
[47:32] before the foundation of the world
[47:36] we were in the thoughts of god for all
[47:39] of eternity
[47:40] we're a part of him a part of his life
[47:44] we had to come in to this flesh
[47:48] right god wanted to make himself
[47:50] tangible
[47:52] that's why he made adam and eve right he
[47:55] wanted to make himself
[47:57] tangible he wanted to reveal himself and
[48:00] also to make himself
[48:02] known so the people that he reveals
[48:03] himself to he also reveals himself
[48:06] through them okay and so god's purpose
[48:09] was to pass that life
[48:12] down satan came
[48:15] and what put a hybrid
[48:18] now that life is hybridized and we learn
[48:21] through the scriptures up through the
[48:23] time of the flood the life becomes
[48:24] completely hybridized
[48:27] we're in in the whole human race is
[48:30] subject to death
[48:32] and decay and that life now is simply a
[48:35] predestinated
[48:36] spiritual life a family can
[48:40] you know bring forth three godly
[48:42] children and and
[48:43] one ungodly children i mean we look
[48:45] through the scriptures
[48:47] jacob and esau right right in the same
[48:51] family the same exact parents
[48:53] why because we're all hybrid and the
[48:56] true
[48:57] predestined life comes by only by
[49:00] election amen
[49:04] and so still we're subject to death
[49:08] we sin we're worthy of
[49:12] god's punishment god through his
[49:16] beautiful plan brings forth his son
[49:19] comes in the form of his son sheds his
[49:22] blood
[49:23] and dies so that we can be forgiven
[49:27] but not only that so that the image and
[49:30] lightness which
[49:31] man was originally made in which was
[49:33] perverted
[49:34] which was broken by sin
[49:38] can be restored and he does it in two
[49:41] ways first he gives us the holy ghost
[49:44] and that re that we're now uh
[49:48] transformed by the renewing of our mind
[49:51] we're now being washed by the washing of
[49:55] the water of the word
[49:57] and then the second way that he does
[49:58] that he does what
[50:01] he's going to give us a new body a
[50:04] perfect body an immortal body
[50:07] and then we're going to go even further
[50:09] he's going to take this earth
[50:11] where the whole earth is subject to
[50:13] death
[50:14] decay what is he going to do he's going
[50:17] to
[50:18] revitalize just like he's going to
[50:19] revitalize
[50:21] these atoms with life he's going to
[50:24] revitalize this earth
[50:26] with life so that in the end he has what
[50:29] he planned
[50:30] perfectly from the beginning which was
[50:33] an immortal god
[50:34] with an immortal family on a perfect
[50:38] earth
[50:40] and he what did he want to do he wanted
[50:42] to he allowed it
[50:44] he created it in such a way so that it
[50:46] could
[50:47] and would fall so that we would be
[50:50] subject to death
[50:51] why so he could reveal himself
[50:54] and we could love him for all that he is
[51:00] the world doesn't like that thought they
[51:03] don't like that idea
[51:04] that's right it's not forum
[51:08] god's predestinated seed just say wow
[51:12] thank you lord i just want to be a part
[51:14] of it
[51:18] of course we're familiar talking about
[51:20] immortality
[51:23] john 3 16 we understand
[51:27] that eternal life is a gift
[51:31] romans 6 23 the wages of sin is death
[51:35] but the gift of god is eternal life
[51:38] through jesus christ our lord it's a
[51:39] gift
[51:41] it's a gift it's not we we deserve we
[51:43] really do deserve it's not just a
[51:46] mockery of the word we really do deserve
[51:48] death
[51:50] we deserve the punishment that is to
[51:52] come
[51:53] for sinners but god made a way
[51:56] and he gave us that gift and all we have
[51:59] to do is
[52:00] accept the gift you don't have to do
[52:03] anything you don't have to work yourself
[52:04] up
[52:05] just to say thank you lord i receive
[52:08] what you've given
[52:19] so brother branham says there's one only
[52:22] one form
[52:24] of eternal life in
[52:27] the sermon thirsting for life 1957 he
[52:29] says everything
[52:31] that has a beginning has an end
[52:34] and it's things that had no beginning
[52:36] that has no end
[52:38] and there's only one eternal life that's
[52:41] in god
[52:42] all other life has an end but god has no
[52:45] end because he had no beginning
[52:47] and we being parts of god have eternal
[52:50] life with god
[52:53] but everything that has any other type
[52:56] of life had a beginning it has an end
[52:58] only the eternal
[53:00] things last now the word forever comes
[53:03] in a conjunction forever and forever
[53:05] forever is a space of time but eternity
[53:08] is no begin or end
[53:10] it's just a perfect circle there's no
[53:11] end to it at all it's eternity forever
[53:13] like
[53:14] you see forever and conjunction forever
[53:16] two spaces of time
[53:18] but eternity and eternal life means the
[53:21] same thing see it's the same
[53:22] category that it had no begin neither
[53:25] does it have an
[53:26] end it's forever the same ever was and
[53:29] ever will be the same
[53:32] amen so the english definition which
[53:36] brother branham
[53:37] applied to eternal then we understand is
[53:41] no beginning and no ending
[53:44] that's the definition the prophet
[53:46] defines what eternal means
[53:49] eternal means eternity which had no
[53:52] beginning or has
[53:53] no end so let's
[53:57] let's look at that with that
[53:58] understanding let's look at the
[54:00] scriptures
[54:02] that use this word in different ways now
[54:05] in the greek there's two different words
[54:08] um that can be translated as eternal one
[54:11] is ion
[54:12] and one is ionios all right
[54:16] so and i'm not going to read the
[54:18] definition of each of them
[54:21] because if you just simply take it
[54:24] at face value that these things mean
[54:27] eternal
[54:28] okay as people describe them to be
[54:32] you'll see the absurdity of translating
[54:35] the words
[54:36] to mean having no beginning or no ending
[54:40] or even if you just take it like some
[54:41] theologians take it no
[54:43] ending okay it's you'll see how
[54:46] absurd that thought is so colossians
[54:50] 1 26.
[55:00] even the mystery which has been hid
[55:03] from eternity
[55:07] and from generations but now is made
[55:09] manifest to his saints
[55:12] what so just just to break it down when
[55:16] i'm saying eternity hid from
[55:18] the ages that's the word i i own all
[55:21] right
[55:22] so if we're going to take ion to mean
[55:25] eternal
[55:27] then we're going to insert every time it
[55:29] says i on we're going to just say
[55:30] eternal even the mystery which has been
[55:33] from eternity
[55:36] the mystery has been hid from eternity
[55:40] no they've properly translated it ages
[55:43] a period of time ephesians 1 21.
[55:53] far above all principality and power
[55:56] and might and dominion and every name
[55:59] that is named
[56:01] not only in this eternity but also
[56:04] in that which is to come
[56:11] not only in this age it's referring to
[56:15] an age there's multiple ages this age
[56:18] and the age to come
[56:22] ii timothy 4 10.
[56:35] for demas has forsaken me having loved
[56:38] this present
[56:40] eternity and has departed unto
[56:42] thessalonica et cetera
[56:45] this present eternity
[56:49] this present age this present world
[56:53] first corinthians 2 7.
[57:01] but we speak the wisdom of god in a
[57:03] mystery even the hidden wisdom
[57:05] which god ordained before eternity
[57:09] unto our glory
[57:12] before it that doesn't not going to work
[57:16] before the world or before the ages
[57:20] hebrews 5 6.
[57:27] as he saith also in another place thou
[57:30] art a priest
[57:31] for eternity after the order of
[57:34] melchizedek i mean it could possibly
[57:36] work but the reality is
[57:38] he's a high priest during redemption
[57:43] he's interceding during redemption when
[57:45] we when
[57:46] we're all immortal on a new earth
[57:50] there's not a need for a priest anymore
[57:52] right
[57:53] during the millennium sure there is
[57:57] we're we are kings and priests we're now
[58:00] kings and priests
[58:01] and we will be in the millennium too
[58:04] matthew 13 verse 40.
[58:20] as therefore the tares are gathered and
[58:22] burned in the fire
[58:24] so shall it be in the end of eternity
[58:29] it doesn't work again you see present
[58:33] and beginning all attached to this word
[58:37] ion
[58:40] which we're told means
[58:43] at the very least no ending
[58:48] all right so then ionios is the other
[58:50] word and
[58:51] i'll read you the definition of this
[58:52] without beginning and end that which
[58:54] always has been
[58:56] and always will be without beginning or
[58:58] without end
[59:01] second peter 1 11.
[59:12] for sow an entrance shall be ministered
[59:13] unto you abundantly
[59:15] into the eternal kingdom of our lord and
[59:18] savior jesus christ i mean that could
[59:20] work
[59:21] that could work but if you're looking at
[59:23] the millennium
[59:24] where where christ has his kingdom
[59:28] sits on the throne of his father david
[59:30] it's a period of time it's a thousand
[59:31] years
[59:33] and then at the end of that time he
[59:35] gives up he
[59:36] he relinquishes that all all dominion is
[59:40] put under his feet then he hands it over
[59:42] to the father and so that the father
[59:44] and so that god will be all in all so
[59:47] his kingdom has a beginning has an
[59:50] ending a millennial kingdom
[59:53] romans 16 25.
[1:00:04] now of him that is of power to establish
[1:00:06] you according to my gospel
[1:00:08] and the preaching of jesus christ
[1:00:10] according to the revelation of the
[1:00:11] mystery
[1:00:12] which was kept secret since eternity
[1:00:16] began
[1:00:21] no it doesn't work eternity doesn't
[1:00:23] begin
[1:00:25] ages begin jude 1
[1:00:29] 7
[1:00:36] even as sodom and gomorrah and the
[1:00:38] cities about them in like manner
[1:00:40] giving themselves over to fornication
[1:00:42] and going after strange flesh
[1:00:45] are set forth for an example suffering
[1:00:48] the vengeance of eternal fire
[1:00:51] here it's translated as eternal fire can
[1:00:54] i ask a question
[1:00:56] are they still be are they still burning
[1:00:59] in the city of sodom today
[1:01:04] how long did the fire last
[1:01:07] it was pretty quick right it did its job
[1:01:10] it burned them completely totally so
[1:01:13] here we are
[1:01:14] even looking at this verse taking it at
[1:01:17] face value we have to understand
[1:01:19] what is this fire what is this eternal
[1:01:22] fire
[1:01:23] it's god god is the eternal fire
[1:01:27] god reigned down from heaven brimstone
[1:01:30] from god that's what that's what the
[1:01:34] that's what the verse says he rained
[1:01:37] down the brim so
[1:01:38] they suffered the vengeance of eternal
[1:01:40] fire if we're going to understand
[1:01:42] fire that has no beginning and no ending
[1:01:44] we understand that when that
[1:01:46] it was burning those people sodom was
[1:01:48] burning before the world began
[1:01:50] and it's continuing to burn why can't
[1:01:52] they they don't even know really the
[1:01:54] location today
[1:01:55] where sodom and gomorrah is it should be
[1:01:56] easy to find they're still burning
[1:01:59] their corpses are there still lit on
[1:02:01] fire
[1:02:03] that's not what eternal fire means it
[1:02:05] means it burns up
[1:02:06] until it consumes completely
[1:02:11] matthew 25 46.
[1:02:22] and these shall go away into everlasting
[1:02:24] punishment to put the righteous
[1:02:26] into life eternal
[1:02:30] all right so these are two greek words
[1:02:36] both translated sometimes as eternal
[1:02:38] sometimes as worlds sometimes as ages
[1:02:41] you can see that
[1:02:45] it's basically its meaning and its
[1:02:47] translation
[1:02:49] changes depends on depending on what
[1:02:52] it's used in conjunction for
[1:02:54] amen so if it's used speaking about
[1:02:57] eternal life or eternal god or eternal
[1:03:01] spirit
[1:03:02] we can understand by the word that it's
[1:03:05] used in conjunction with
[1:03:06] what what that word means
[1:03:09] right if it's talking about eternal life
[1:03:11] okay well what is the
[1:03:13] what is the teaching of eternal life we
[1:03:16] understand it means there's
[1:03:17] we were in god for all of eternity we
[1:03:19] come we're born here we experience
[1:03:22] the baptism of the holy spirit and we
[1:03:24] live on
[1:03:25] for with no end for all of eternity
[1:03:30] but other places it's translated in such
[1:03:32] a way where you understand
[1:03:33] it's referring to a period of time so
[1:03:36] when it's talking about
[1:03:37] punishment what the scripture we just
[1:03:40] read
[1:03:41] everlasting punishment okay it's the
[1:03:44] same exact word that's
[1:03:46] used there in english it's a different
[1:03:48] word in the greek
[1:03:50] it's both ionian
[1:03:53] okay so it's both ionian so
[1:03:56] if the theologian would say if
[1:04:00] the reward is without end
[1:04:04] so is the punishment without end no
[1:04:08] we have to know the context of what
[1:04:11] what the scripture teaches about the
[1:04:13] subject
[1:04:14] all right and let's let's look at some
[1:04:16] of those scriptures
[1:04:23] mark 9 43 and 44.
[1:04:35] and if the hand offend thee cut it off
[1:04:39] it's better for thee to enter into life
[1:04:41] maimed
[1:04:42] than having two hands to go into hell
[1:04:46] into the fire that never shall be
[1:04:48] quenched
[1:04:50] where their worm dies not and the fire
[1:04:53] is not
[1:04:54] quenched i want you to look at the
[1:04:57] the verse though closely the worm
[1:05:00] and the fire don't die
[1:05:04] so what is it saying it's not saying
[1:05:06] that the person doesn't
[1:05:08] die it's saying the worm
[1:05:11] and the fire don't die why is it saying
[1:05:14] that
[1:05:14] because the worm and the fire will
[1:05:17] destroy
[1:05:18] until nothing's left obviously when
[1:05:20] you're talking about worm
[1:05:22] you're talking about a literal grave
[1:05:25] right
[1:05:26] so there's a literal grave where your
[1:05:29] this physical body goes to
[1:05:31] but there's also a place where the lost
[1:05:33] go to
[1:05:34] we see that in the in the parable of the
[1:05:37] rich man and lazarus
[1:05:39] there's a place where they go but what
[1:05:41] is what does fire do why would they use
[1:05:44] fire
[1:05:45] can i ask you a question when you put a
[1:05:46] log
[1:05:48] in the fire what does it do does it last
[1:05:51] for all eternity
[1:05:54] i started a fire in my backyard it's
[1:05:56] still going i don't know it'll never go
[1:05:57] out
[1:05:59] no it fire consumes
[1:06:04] until nothing is left worms consume
[1:06:08] until nothing is left so get the picture
[1:06:10] right
[1:06:11] the worm and the fire don't die because
[1:06:14] they consume until nothing is left
[1:06:18] isaiah 66 24 this is where this verse is
[1:06:22] taken where that
[1:06:23] quote that jesus just spoke he's taking
[1:06:27] that
[1:06:27] from isaiah 66.
[1:06:33] 24 and they shall go forth and look upon
[1:06:37] the carcasses of the men
[1:06:39] that have transgressed against me for
[1:06:41] their worm shall not die
[1:06:43] neither shall their fire be quenched and
[1:06:45] they shall be
[1:06:46] abhorring unto all flesh
[1:06:50] okay so this is talking about the
[1:06:53] judgment that takes place
[1:06:55] upon jerusalem all right the end of the
[1:06:59] tribulation period
[1:07:01] so what is the picture that's being
[1:07:04] painted that there's dead bodies
[1:07:06] and there's fire and there's worms
[1:07:09] consuming these bodies
[1:07:13] so does that mean that the we're
[1:07:15] literally going to be going through all
[1:07:17] of eternity
[1:07:18] and there's going to be dead bodies
[1:07:20] laying all around
[1:07:22] and we're going to be looking at worms
[1:07:23] eat them and fire burning that would not
[1:07:26] be
[1:07:27] paradise right it what is what is being
[1:07:31] paint what picture is being
[1:07:32] being painted here what we just spoke of
[1:07:36] there's an utter destruction and it's
[1:07:38] going to be a there this is talking
[1:07:40] about there
[1:07:41] there's going to be a memory of that but
[1:07:43] thank god the memory of it is not going
[1:07:44] to be eternal
[1:07:46] it doesn't need to be eternal
[1:07:51] matthew 10 28.
[1:07:58] and fear not them which kill the body
[1:08:01] but are not able to kill the soul but
[1:08:03] rather
[1:08:03] fear him which is able to destroy both
[1:08:07] soul
[1:08:07] and body in hell
[1:08:13] very simple very simple beautiful verse
[1:08:16] if it's if to kill is to deprive the
[1:08:19] body
[1:08:19] of life then hell would seem to be
[1:08:23] to deprive both the physical and the
[1:08:26] spiritual life that is
[1:08:28] an annihilation or an extinction of
[1:08:32] being
[1:08:32] that's the picture that's being painted
[1:08:35] god will take a person
[1:08:36] out of existence don't fear the one that
[1:08:39] can just destroy
[1:08:40] kill the body feel the one that fear the
[1:08:43] one that can kill
[1:08:44] the body and also snuff
[1:08:48] the soul's life out of it
[1:08:52] questions and answers on hebrews number
[1:08:53] one 1957
[1:08:55] brother banham says he'll die he'll go
[1:08:57] to a lake of fire
[1:08:58] and brimstone which burns where burning
[1:09:00] is going on forever and forever and
[1:09:02] maybe for a hundred million years
[1:09:04] his soul may be tormented in a lake of
[1:09:06] fire and brimstone
[1:09:08] you say will it be just like regular
[1:09:10] brimstone i believe it'll be a million
[1:09:12] times
[1:09:12] worse than that believe you couldn't
[1:09:14] describe it by fire by a literal fire
[1:09:16] the only reason it's put by fire that
[1:09:18] fire is the most consuming
[1:09:20] thing that we had it absolutely consumes
[1:09:23] and destroys
[1:09:24] everything fire does amen
[1:09:30] so let's look at those who
[1:09:34] refuse to believe the gospel what what
[1:09:37] does the bible say about them first
[1:09:38] corinthians 1
[1:09:39] 18. i'm just going to read quick through
[1:09:41] these brother brad
[1:09:42] for the preaching of the cross is to
[1:09:44] them that perish foolishness but to un
[1:09:47] unto us which are saved it is the power
[1:09:50] of god so how did he
[1:09:51] describe those who consider the cross
[1:09:53] foolishness
[1:09:56] he said that they are them that perish
[1:09:59] ii corinthians 2
[1:10:01] 15 for we are unto god a sweet savior of
[1:10:04] christ
[1:10:05] in them that are saved and in them that
[1:10:07] perish
[1:10:09] ii thessalonians 2 10
[1:10:12] and with all deceivableness of
[1:10:14] unrighteousness in them that perish
[1:10:16] because they re they receive not the
[1:10:18] love of the truth that they might be
[1:10:20] saved
[1:10:21] romans 6 23 for the wages of sin is
[1:10:25] death
[1:10:26] but the gift of god is eternal life
[1:10:28] through jesus christ our lord
[1:10:30] matthew 7 13 enter ye in at the straight
[1:10:33] gate
[1:10:34] for wide is the gate and broad is the
[1:10:36] way that leadeth to destruction and many
[1:10:38] there be which go
[1:10:39] in there at so if hell is eternal
[1:10:44] then those who perish never perish those
[1:10:47] who are destroyed
[1:10:49] are never destroyed and those that die
[1:10:51] never die
[1:10:53] but the scripture speaks of the
[1:10:55] punishment of those who don't believe
[1:10:58] as death
[1:11:02] that is what god promised in the
[1:11:04] beginning the day you eat thereof
[1:11:06] that day you die
[1:11:10] the punishment for uncovered
[1:11:13] sin is death
[1:11:17] revelation 20 14.
[1:11:32] and death and hell were cast into the
[1:11:34] lake of fire
[1:11:36] this is the second death
[1:11:39] so what is the first death
[1:11:43] the ceasing of physical existence
[1:11:47] so then what is the second death
[1:11:50] ceasing of spiritual existence
[1:11:53] as jesus said fear him that can destroy
[1:11:56] both body
[1:11:57] and soul in hell
[1:12:01] revelation 20 verse 10
[1:12:07] and the devil that deceived them was
[1:12:10] cast
[1:12:10] into the lake of fire and brimstone
[1:12:12] where the beast and the false prophet
[1:12:14] are
[1:12:15] and shall be tormented day and night
[1:12:18] forever and ever again
[1:12:22] these from ion to ion
[1:12:25] from age to age again so this
[1:12:29] these this is the devil so a spiritual
[1:12:32] being
[1:12:33] the beast the beast is a
[1:12:36] uh is an empire but what is behind it
[1:12:39] it's it's a spirit
[1:12:41] and the false prophet again a person
[1:12:45] but yet there's a spirit behind it an
[1:12:47] antichrist spirit behind it
[1:12:49] and so these spirits will be cast into
[1:12:54] the lake that burns with fire and
[1:12:56] brimstone and what is it
[1:13:00] they'll be tormented in day and night
[1:13:02] forever and ever
[1:13:04] from age to age for a long period of
[1:13:06] time
[1:13:09] brother branham says it could be
[1:13:10] millions and billions of years but
[1:13:12] it has to come to an end
[1:13:15] because what is it it's the second death
[1:13:21] malachi 4 1
[1:13:26] for behold the day cometh that shall
[1:13:27] burn as an oven and all the proud yea
[1:13:29] and all that do wickedly
[1:13:31] shall be stubble and the day that cometh
[1:13:34] shall burn them up
[1:13:35] saith the lord of hosts that it shall
[1:13:37] leave them neither root
[1:13:39] nor branch everything will be burnt
[1:13:43] up and consumed 1959
[1:13:46] questions and answers brother branham
[1:13:48] says i don't believe the bible teaches
[1:13:49] an eternal burning hell it doesn't
[1:13:51] because hell if hell is eternal and
[1:13:53] people that go there will be punished
[1:13:55] eternally
[1:13:56] the only way they could be eternally
[1:13:57] punished they'd have to have
[1:14:00] eternal life and there's only one form
[1:14:03] of eternal life
[1:14:04] and that's in god see so they have to
[1:14:07] come to an
[1:14:08] annihilation see that is their physical
[1:14:11] part becomes annihilated
[1:14:13] and then their spiritual part becomes
[1:14:15] annihilated that's completely
[1:14:17] consumed there's no more to it neither
[1:14:19] in root nor branch
[1:14:21] the bible calls it they're completely
[1:14:24] done away
[1:14:26] so exodus 21 23-25 says and if any
[1:14:31] mischief follow
[1:14:32] then thou sh thou shalt give life for
[1:14:34] life
[1:14:36] eye for eye tooth for tooth hand for
[1:14:38] hand
[1:14:39] foot for foot burning for burning wound
[1:14:42] for wound stripe for stripe
[1:14:45] so think about this a crime
[1:14:49] committed is a crime committed
[1:14:52] in time worthy of eternal
[1:14:56] conscious punishment it isn't
[1:14:59] it isn't god would be meeting out a
[1:15:02] punishment
[1:15:03] that was not in line with his own divine
[1:15:08] justice
[1:15:12] ezekiel 18 verse 4
[1:15:17] behold all souls are mine as the soul of
[1:15:20] the father
[1:15:21] so also the soul of the son is mine
[1:15:25] the soul that sinneth it shall die
[1:15:30] amen the soul that sins is going to die
[1:15:34] that's exactly what
[1:15:36] he said to adam he's a faithful god
[1:15:40] he's not going to change the punishment
[1:15:43] at the end
[1:15:44] the the punishment is death
[1:15:49] so again immortality is not no longer
[1:15:52] the default now
[1:15:53] adam was created with immortality
[1:15:57] of a body he lost it
[1:16:00] it's not the default for you and me
[1:16:02] that's why you see
[1:16:03] we there's gray in our beards and on our
[1:16:07] on our head why because we're not
[1:16:09] immortal we're
[1:16:10] we're dying we're getting old we're
[1:16:13] getting weaker
[1:16:14] we'll go if the lord tarries many of us
[1:16:17] will go to the grave right
[1:16:21] that's because of sin but
[1:16:25] that which is on the inside of you and i
[1:16:27] is redeemed
[1:16:30] amen but that which is on the outside is
[1:16:33] not redeemed yet we're waiting
[1:16:35] still waiting for the redemption of our
[1:16:38] bodies
[1:16:40] and that's a gift that's a gift given
[1:16:43] and revealed through jesus christ alone
[1:16:47] he is the only way
[1:16:50] so as we as we read hell is described
[1:16:52] using darkness
[1:16:54] fire destruction perishing
[1:16:58] death what it why all of that
[1:17:01] is pictures of annihilation
[1:17:05] it's not pictures of conscience
[1:17:07] conscious torment
[1:17:10] if the bible wanted to say you're going
[1:17:11] to be eternally
[1:17:13] and consciously tormented
[1:17:17] it can say that but it's not the picture
[1:17:19] that it gives
[1:17:20] every picture that it gives is showing
[1:17:23] this god is going to bring
[1:17:25] the wicked life to a complete
[1:17:28] and god's judgment is eternal
[1:17:33] god's fire is eternal but the conscious
[1:17:37] torment is not
[1:17:40] eternal those cast into hell will
[1:17:44] eventually
[1:17:45] obviously as we stated before be
[1:17:47] annihilated
[1:17:48] why because they do not possess eternal
[1:17:51] life
[1:17:53] god's judgment calls for
[1:17:57] death physical and
[1:18:00] spiritual death we
[1:18:03] we are we are receivers of god's grace
[1:18:08] musicians if you come
[1:18:12] amen well last week we got an extra long
[1:18:16] sermon and this week we got an extra
[1:18:18] short one so we just
[1:18:20] even it out for everybody
[1:18:24] but it you know i in studying this and
[1:18:27] looking at
[1:18:28] uh different theologians through history
[1:18:31] um i'm just amazed at
[1:18:34] how the lord dealt with brother branham
[1:18:38] um time and time again you know
[1:18:41] some people they study theology and it
[1:18:43] takes them away from the message
[1:18:45] the more i study it personally this is
[1:18:47] just for me i'm not saying that
[1:18:49] everybody should be this
[1:18:50] way but personally just for me as i
[1:18:52] study it i just go
[1:18:54] thank you lord for a vindicated prophet
[1:18:58] he pierces through you don't even
[1:19:01] understand
[1:19:02] and thank god you probably don't you
[1:19:05] don't really understand
[1:19:06] all the difficult thorny
[1:19:10] hard theological issues that peop
[1:19:13] that people have battled over over the
[1:19:16] years that brother branham just comes
[1:19:17] with real simple it's a finish
[1:19:19] things like it's a finished work at
[1:19:21] calvary well you realize
[1:19:23] how what that you don't even realize
[1:19:25] what that means
[1:19:27] you just say oh praise the lord it's a
[1:19:29] finished work at calvary
[1:19:30] that is answering a question that
[1:19:32] pentecostals divided over
[1:19:34] and fought over for so long
[1:19:38] and things like this you know you you
[1:19:40] there's people that
[1:19:42] there's people that believe like
[1:19:43] jehovah's witnesses they don't believe
[1:19:44] in hell at all
[1:19:45] they believe it's all um metaphorical
[1:19:49] they believe that when you die you go to
[1:19:50] the grave either you're going to stay in
[1:19:52] the grave
[1:19:53] or you're going to be resurrected right
[1:19:57] and so people will come and say oh you
[1:19:59] know
[1:20:02] they'll accuse say he doesn't believe
[1:20:04] any eternal hell
[1:20:06] william branham doesn't believe in
[1:20:07] eternal hell he's a false
[1:20:09] a false teacher well brother branham
[1:20:12] brings such a balanced
[1:20:14] truth on this topic you know
[1:20:18] many there's many theologians that bring
[1:20:21] well
[1:20:21] hell's eternal there's other ones say
[1:20:23] there isn't even any hell at all
[1:20:25] brother branham brings that perfect
[1:20:27] balance there is
[1:20:28] a hell there is a place that unbelievers
[1:20:32] go to right now right but it's not
[1:20:35] eternal
[1:20:36] because they they would have to be
[1:20:38] immortal and on
[1:20:39] god only gives immortality as a gift to
[1:20:42] those that believe in jesus christ amen
[1:20:46] let's pray heavenly father we thank you
[1:20:48] so much for your word
[1:20:50] it truly is light and life to us lord i
[1:20:53] thank you
[1:20:56] lord for sending the vindicated profit
[1:20:59] to
[1:21:00] us lord it's not about the man
[1:21:03] it's not about following a man lord
[1:21:07] it's how you've chosen to reveal
[1:21:09] yourself but it's about the truth
[1:21:14] that you use that man to bring lord in
[1:21:17] such a humble
[1:21:18] and simple way to cut through all the
[1:21:20] nonsense
[1:21:23] to bring us the reality of christ in
[1:21:25] this day
[1:21:27] lord and all these things this this

[1:31:17] lord and that there will be more coming
[1:31:18] and i thought my
[1:31:20] how how brother branham would

[1:31:25] would just pray and
[1:31:27] wait upon you lord let us be a people
[1:31:31] that would do the same
[1:31:32] we know it's going to take the same kind
[1:31:35] of life

[1:31:39] help us to be people of prayer people
[1:31:44] that wait upon you lord
[1:31:46] people that seek your face
[1:31:50] lord break down walls break down
[1:31:52] barriers i know there's a thousand
[1:31:54] things
[1:31:55] that's preventing us from being what we
[1:31:58] should be in this area in our life lord
[1:32:01] i pray lord that you would help us to
[1:32:02] have
[1:32:04] that single vision that single focus
[1:32:08] lord that it wouldn't be about what this
[1:32:11] one
[1:32:12] expects or this one's saying or what
[1:32:13] this one thinks
[1:32:15] but that we would have our own
[1:32:19] walk our own place our own
[1:32:22] experience not not just something
[1:32:26] that we talk about from years ago but a
[1:32:27] present tense
