before you lord humbly lord believing that you're in all every aspect and every part of our life lord you've met us here tonight lord we've gathered lord here on this wednesday night evening service lord and many different hands went up when i asked that question would there be any needs upon your heart and lord hands went up everywhere both my hands up lord for we're needy people lord we come with different various lord situations and requests and prayers and things upon our heart upon our mind lord and we just bring them all now to you lord for you said cast your care upon me lord so we cast them at the feet of you tonight lord jesus we pray that you touch every life touch every heart god make your word real lord to each and every single believer bless us now lord we give you the preeminence in jesus christ's name amen amen if you have your bible turn the book of genesis chapter 32 amen genesis chapter 32 and i'll also have you turn um to another scripture here in romans chapter eight brothers i did send a powerpoint you can have that up whenever you want it's just fine i'd like to speak to you here tonight on messiah character messiah character genesis chapter 32 familiar uh scripture here and we're going to get to this lord willing if we come to it and our we'll get to our text our opening text is going to be different than what we start off with but that's all right very familiar with jacob and the life of jacob and we just want to pick up just here at verse let's move on down to verse 24. and jacob was left alone and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day and when he saw that he prevailed not against him he touched the hollow of his thigh and the hollow of jacob's thigh was out of joint you could mute this pulpit mike brother brad you mute this one and just have me here let's read that again verse 25 and when he saw that he prevailed not against him he touched the hollow of his thigh and the hollow of jacob's thigh was out of joint as he wrestled with him and he said let me go for the day breaketh and he said i will not let thee go except thou bless me and he said unto him what is thy name and he said jacob and he said thy name shall called thy name shall be called no more jacob but israel for as a prince has thou power with god and with men and has prevailed and jacob asked him and said tell me i pray thee thy name and he said wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name and he blessed him there and jacob called the name of the place penile for i have seen god face to face and my life is preserved and as he passed over penile the sun rose upon him and he halted upon his thigh therefore the children of israel ate not of the sinu which shrank which is upon the hollow of the thigh and to this day because he touched the hollow of jacob's thigh in the sinew that shrank amen let's just look at one more scripture romans 8 before you're seated i'll just read one more then have you be seated romans 8 28. very familiar favorite bible verse for some romans 8 28. let's read this in verse 29 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren let's just bow our heads here just to ask god to bless the word lord father we've read these words lord and i've believed that you've given me an anointing and unction lord you've stirred my heart in a certain direction lord and i believe that's for somebody here tonight maybe lord even those that are streaming that couldn't be here those that'll listen to this later lord by way of archive we just right now lord raise our hands and surrender lord as a sign of surrender to say we're giving it to you now all things lord everything that we that we do everything let it be done for your glory everything that is said lord let it be for your glory lord i pray that you would come and take control now father and move beyond the realms of mortal men lord and move into that realm of the soul where real change can happen that's our desire lord for every person that's here may you grant it now to us lord we ask in jesus name amen you can be seated amen preaching on messiah character and i have a powerpoint that we'll show here in just a moment you don't have to put that up yet going to take just a minute to get to it some of what we're going to start just to lay a foundation we'll be real familiar to some of you that were part of the sunday school that we took a few weeks back on abraham isaac and jacob the god of abraham isaac and jacob and some of it will be very familiar to you you'll find a strand when you study the bible or i could call it a thread that you'll find two threads running through the bible especially in the whole of the entire old testament and that thread is very simple and that is that god calls himself the god of jacob abraham isaac and jacob now it's interesting because man doesn't do abraham nor isaac nor jacob came up with this phrase or got together and and came up with a name for god but god is actually by saying this is identifying himself with a family a specific family a father a son and a grandfather and god identifies himself with this one family and their every nation in the old testament uh would be identified or they would have their own god their own uh their own uh symbol the their their own signet uh that that they would be identified by you had nations that would i identify their national god as the god of bell you had nations that would nationally symbolize their god of moloch or whatever nation if it was a babylonian god of some sort of a starters or or or whatever it was they would identify themselves religiously with their own god and it was very important for those nations that they symbolize themself because it was it was a symbol of power it was a symbol of who fought for them and when they would come to war there was a religious aspect behind the war the battle that you would even see sometimes uh the battles even some of them i read two of them uh here that i won't take the time to read here but it was the entire war was a religious war it was a religious battle and so israel was a nation just like the other nations in the world and israel was identified religiously signifying that their god was jehovah and he was considered by all of the nations to be the god of israel we talk about the nation of america that were founded upon judeo-christian values and that we're a christian nation what is it we're attaching ourself to a belief system or a world view or a way that you look at perspective that you look upon life of of how your your opinions are molded and so israel was looked at as the god or the god of israel was looked at as jehovah but israel had something very different than the other nations you see israel was not just claiming to have a god like the gods of the hittites or the perizzites or the babylonians but israel was making something a far greater claim than just a god but israel was claiming that our god is the god of all gods and in fact further than that israel was saying he's not just the god of all gods he's the only god he's the only real god the only true god the only god that really exists they went further than that and said and the also this god who we serve is the only god and he's the god of all gods and he's also the god who created the universe the god who created everything that sees everything that acts everything that moves everything that has breath was created by this one god and this one god just so happens to associate himself with us it starts to make sense why they became a target and an enemy you see when you say something like that people want to pick on you and want to challenge what you believe and so you find this in isaiah the chapter 40. we won't read it here i got the notations we'll just skip over these you'll find it also in the book of job you'll find it in the book of psalms this that you are the god of all gods and the other so so you'll find this as we said these two threads one thread coming through the scriptures but the other thread that you'll find is that the god of the whole universe one thread that you'll find is that the god of the jews are claiming the god of the universe and you'll also find a thread very true that the god of the universe is the god of the jews and they were actually they were really claiming that the creator of everything that is the stars the galaxies had actually made a very personal intimate relationship with not all humanity not just the entire world not all that's living and breathing but israel said that god has created and attached himself to one small tiny group of people it's a big claim anybody can claim it anybody could have said it but it would take god to back it up that the god of the universe the god of the galaxies had became the god of the jews and he was calling himself the god of abraham isaac and jacob imagine the god of abraham a grandfather isaac a father jacob a grandfather a father and a son that the god of the entire universe could you imagine the reaction or the ire that it drew from the rest of the world could you imagine the it was an incredible claim but what you understand uh these two threads you know if you read just read the book of genesis because the book of genesis covers all of this the god of jacob the god of abraham isaac and jacob and and let me just move through some of these notes just to save time because we got so much more but we just i want to lay this foundation uh very clearly and so what you find is if you and it's it's amazing because the the book of genesis let me cover this without genesis without the book of genesis you would have no ground for that claim at all if the bible if you opened your bible up and you missed the book of genesis and you didn't have the beginning then you started with the book of exodus imagine how much you would miss you would get a dialogue and a story but no basis for that story at all but what you what you understand is is that genesis says that the genesis is the book that says the god of the jews is the god of the universe and the god of the universe is the god of the jews now remember the book of genesis covers more time than the whole rest of the bible put together one book covers more years in time than the rest of the entire bible put together if you were to calculate all of the years and the months and the days of coverage that one book covers more incredible and so from exodus to the last bit of revelation you have about 1500 years of time exodus to revelation about 1500 years whereas genesis covers all the way from the beginning of the world all of creation all the days of creation and we don't exactly even know how many years or how many exact days or how many exact months that covers it covers a massive span from the history of the world from beginning right through all the way to joseph which is much longer than 1500 years so what you realize is that when you read your bible and you read the book of genesis you're not reading it like a day this is december and then over here's uh october and over here is november this is the the year over here you're not reading it like year after year after year chronologically but actually time has been compressed into just a little bitty tiny uh uh increment just a little bitty tiny slot of compressed time it covers many many centuries as compared to the entire rest of the bible it's a longer period of time and so chapter 1 through chapter 11 when you read genesis 1 and all the way through chapter 11 is a very short which you'd call only 11 chapters but it covers a massive a very short section but covers a massive amount of time centuries and many peoples and it talks about many nations and the entire forming of the world and the forming of culture and the forming of societies and and cities and kingdoms and all of that happens in just 11 chapters of your bible just compressed like this so there's no way to get every single detail there's no way to get every single story but it compresses it down over many centuries and many people and many nations but then when you go to chapter 12 and you read genesis 12 through genesis 50. that's many more chapters 12 through 50. a much longer section of your bible but you know it actually only covers a very short space of time just a little space and i'm pointing this out because it's gonna it's gonna it's gonna mean something it was amazing to me when you go to chapter 12 and you have 13 14 15 16. now chapter 1 through 11 is just blazing through time but then when you come to chapter 12 it's almost like time just zeros in on one family on a man named abraham and then when god comes to abraham the whole bible slows down wow and you come through isaac and it's still at that same slow pace you come through jacob you come through all the way through to joseph why because god was saying there's going to be a great emphasis because all of redemption and all of history is going to come through this man and his family and this plan for the rest of the entire world it's a very deliberate zooming from the entire great grand stage of history and all of the people and all of the nations and all of the kindreds and why couldn't god cover all of it because it wasn't going to be about all of it it was going to be about one purpose by one god to one family amen you're seeing history from god's point of view it's incredible because god's a god of variety and if you didn't have even the different authors of the bible were all different men and thought very differently you look at the gospels matthew thought differently than mark and mark thought differently than luke and luke thought differently than even john and brother branham even said that the different gospels had a different anointing and he typed those creatures from the book of revelations the the lion and the ox and the eagle and the man and brother branham said that each one of those books had a different anointing upon it because god was a god of variety they all had a different perspective there's a lot of people who claim that there's contradiction you know that one account and there actually is there's quite a bit of of contradiction that if you don't work out it's not that there's contradiction that they contradict each other so one's true and and you know from from the skeptic's point of view you know you can't use the bible for a a you know an accurate p a historical record because of the inconsistencies but are the contradictions but what is it it's a different it's not a contradiction it's seeing the same story from a different perspective or different point of view or a different way and they're let me say this they have a different purpose the message of matthew and the message of mark have a different emphasis there's a different point they were many different authors because god's a big god of variety do you know what the difference was there was many authors but there was only one editor and that editor was jesus christ the editor of matthew mark luke and john was the same one who wrote genesis the same one who spoke the world into existence and so even the book of john it's incredible i was studying this just this afternoon it's incredible because brother branham says that even the book of john was under that eagle anointing it was it's what was john john was even in the book of revelations john being a type of the bride and so so we know that that there's a there's a different phase you could say it this way that there was a different phase there's even i read a statement earlier that said an interest in a a important person takes three different phases and when you want to find out about an important person there will be three different um uh forget what he called i think he called it phases or depths of of curiosity and if you have depth number one just a a surface level interest in a person uh phase one is that you want to you're interested in what that person did what did they accomplish what did they do in their life i want to know about them and so tell me what they did and so the book of matthew tells you all about what jesus did tells you all about the miracles uh it goes into detail about everything that he did you go further and he said then you go into a further level of interest in that person and you don't just want to know what he did but you want to know what did he say amen and so you read his books and you read his writings and you get his you you want to find out not just what he did but you want to find out what did he say but then he said but then there's a third depth and it's only the deepest curiosity that'll reach this depth is not just what he did and not just what he said but you want to know who he was you want to know what he was and and i just thought that was wonderful because you know a lot of people are curious about what did jesus do and that's as far as their depth of christianity ever comes to it's just learning and reading about what he did what he did and the miracles that he performed some people go further and they're interested in what did he have to say what did he teach but i believe that to a real believer it's good to know what he did it's good to know what he said but you say lord i want to know who are you what are you today lord reveal yourself to me personally in a personal way and even the book of john covers not so much about what he did it's amazing under that eagle anointing it was it was because it was specific to the bride that it wasn't just what he did did you know that there's no mention in the book of john about the conception or the birth of jesus interesting there's no mention these are just amazing what was omitted in the book of john knows it was omitted because john didn't believe in it no it had nothing to do with that matthew covered it mark it was a was it omitted because john felt like it was covered uh uh enough uh in by other writers no it was that you understand the emphasis or the reason why john was writing there was a point there was an attention there was an attraction there was something that he was trying to say and it didn't cover his birth it didn't cover his baptism no mention of really of his of the temptations and the wilderness there's no mentions of casting out of demons the mount transfiguration uh is omitted no mention of the last supper uh no the bread turning and the wine no mention of gethsemane no mention of the ascension did you know that that's not in the book of john you say brother matt was it because it wasn't important no it was because it was a zoomed in scoped in image of not just what he did or what he said but who he was say how's that how does that connect to what you're preaching on because because it's not what is what does john cover not just what he did but his character of who he was it's one thing brother branham said it's one thing to know about him it's another thing to know him and paul said to know him as life and brother adam like he argues with the man and says well you don't know your bible it says i may not know my bible but i know the author very well so it was about knowing his character it's about knowing who he was it's a zooming in listen to this what the prophet of god says and i didn't have i didn't get this on the screen so just listen closely now jesus listen to what brother adam says here jesus gave us the example of what we ought to be looking at when he jesus gave us the example of what we ought to be looking at when he reflected his life to us through the word what we should see when we look into god's mirror that's the bible that's his word we should see ourselves identified with him amen that is a perfect example that's what brother adam says that is a perfect example you see it's one thing to look at his life and to look at the ways and to look at his acts and to look at his reactions and to say oh my what a what a w what character he had what humility what what surrender to the father that he had brother branham says but when you look at it you should be able to see yourself you see that brings an entire other dynamic the one thing just to ooh and ah over the life of jesus and what a perfect lamb and what a perfect sacrifice oh but when god really reveals himself to you the prophet said you should put yourself there and say lord let that character be reflected through my life and he says that character listen to what he says here he says but now but we find out as we go along through life now i read this last sunday he says we we go along through life that our character molds us molds the image that we are each one knows that your character molds you to what you are now you've seen people that you just love to be around they might not exactly be in your bracket of society and they may be a different race they may be uh from a different country there's just listen to what he's saying so that maybe a different race maybe maybe even they speak a different language as we spoke of last time might not even speak your your language very well and he says but there's just something about them something about that character that you just love to be in their presence i love to be around believers amen i love to be around christians why why is it is it because we can converse and we're like you know social buddies and we could talk about what we know about the word or how much you know how much i know has nothing to do with that you may not even talk about any scripture verse but there's just some communion that you have when you're around another believer it's the character of christ and he says he says but there's just something about that character because each person is a little dynamo of their own and you put out an atmosphere then you see people that were noble people he says you see people that were noble people but yet you were always glad to get away from them it's just that they create such an atmosphere around where you are nothing against them they're nice people but you just don't like that atmosphere they're in and their character creates now you say brother matt what is that is it is something against the individual has nothing to do with the person as brother adam says you may have nothing against them they might have done nothing to you but just something contradicts with something inside of you and something inside of them amen it isn't that you just avoid there are certain people that you should avoid absolutely light has what fellowship does light have with darkness even even jesus speaks of that the apostle paul speaks of that you know that that you don't don't let yourself be entangled again with the yoke of bondage but he says there's certain people it isn't that you avoid them it's just something contradictory there that you know what is that brother man it's the character of christ in you and the character of christ in another person that brings an attraction to where brother brother branham said they're a little dynamo they put off an atmosphere they put off a certain atmosphere what atmosphere it's the atmosphere of christ it's the atmosphere of jehovah it's not them it's not their human atmosphere because those same believers can get in their own flesh and we all can get in our own flesh and we can create our own stinky atmosphere amen where no one wants to be here trust me i can get in a certain mood you don't want to be around me just ask my wife or my children if you don't believe her you say you brother matt all of us we can get in that we can get in our own self and and create our own human atmosphere and our own it has nothing to do with us has nothing to do with you or how nice you are how intellectual you are but when you've submitted your life and you have the character of christ it attracts the rest of the body of christ it sends off a little dynamo a little atmosphere i say god let me project that kind of christ-like spirit and he says listen to this he says now with our message can we different place here he says can we stand by the looking glass of god's word right here we have god's word can we stand by the looking glass of god's word and see christ reflect in our own lives can we bear such of the reproach of the message that we're standing for here someone say something about it and yet you just don't open your mouth and say nothing about it he was the example because god was reflecting his character in him and then if we're sons and daughters of god god reflects his character in us than we become like him that's my heart's desire i think that's every believer's desire is to become more like him amen no other nature could do this no because he was the moted perfect character of god for it was a fallen character that all nature had that's what romans chapter 3 says that the creation was made subject to vanity and he says it was the nature it was the fallen character that all nature had all men had a fallen character even everything that was under man fell everything has got a dying character and he but he jesus who's he jesus had a living character so he expressed it in christ and he paid the price and then because of his obedience he raised him up on the third day that gives to us the proof it gives to us the assurance that as long as we're in him we're already risen with him listen here i wish i had this on the screen we're all invited to shape our own character to his by his grace we are invited think of it to become characters like his if we're ready to lay our character down amen we're invited to have his if we're willing to lay our character down amen he says and the molding that we had heady high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of god false accusers incontinent despisers of those that are trying to do right having a form of godliness we've got to take the entire full gospel listen and now being that we are identified ourselves with as full gospel people let's mode our character we're invited to be molded in his image that we might reflect his presence jesus says the works that i do shall you do also how unless you have the character of jesus christ how can you do his works unless you have his character so our brother adam says if i had the spirit of beethoven i would write music if i had the spirit of john dillinger i'd pad i'd i'd i'd have guns he says but if i'd have the he said if but if i have the spirit of christ i'd have the character of christ and if i had the character of christ i'd have the works of christ many want the works they they want to bypass the character amen and he says then we let he says to take him let me read this and he says the life that i live shall you live we're invited to by god to take him as an example and let our character be molded like his have many more we could read would have saved time here abraham isaac and jacob were all three men that god chose to identify himself by one family with abraham god begins his entire program he deals with the entire human race the whole of history is zoomed in to this one family this one man god zooms in and stops time time slows down to this one man abraham and god begins his program chooses his plan we we talked about this a lot in the sunday school we taught on the scandal of particularity of how that god chose one family one nation why didn't he just bring a savior for the chinese to save the chinese he could have brought a russian to save the russians but what did he do he chose a jew to save the rest of the world one family to save to save the rest of the world uh one two poets one is called women norman oor and one's called cecil brown they both wrote very short just short little one-liner poems i read this last time i thought it was so good one little liner poems and william norman uh wrote this poem it's very popular uh with the scandal of particularity and his poem was very simple and it was just this how odd of god to choose the jews nice and catchy right how odd of god to choose the jews so alone came a man named cecil brown and he decided to write a second verse and the second verse went like this but not so odd as those who choose a jewish god but spurned the jews but not so odd as those who choose a jewish god but spurn the jews it's amazing you say brother man why did god choose the jews let me give you a very simple answer because that was his choice amen and you can argue with it you may not like it you may try to explain it away but it was still his choice to call himself the god of abraham isaac and jacob amen so genesis as we said are basically 12 through 50 are about these four men these different generations three generations of abraham isaac and jacob if you look at each one of these men there's a counterpart to each one of their lives abraham had a nephew his name was locked as a counterpoint abraham and lot you have isaac and the counterpart point to isaac as his stepbrother ishmael and then you have jacob and what's his counterpoint a twin amen esau you notice that you know pick that up how many it gets closer and closer and closer you go from nephew to stepbrother to twin amen in born of the same family the relationships get closer and closer and closer i say brother matt why is that important because it's showing that through the entire bible there is two lines running through the human race in very stark not a bloodline not a physical bloodline not of a certain race a certain color of skin or a certain ethnicity or nation that you were born or certain language that you speak but the two lines are one of obedience and one of disobedience one of light one of darkness one of faith one of one of intellectual faith and one of revelation amen there's two lines that run through the entire human race that stands in very stark contrast to each other and the entire bible is an invitation to identify your character with one or the other are you in abraham or are you a lot are you an isaac or are you an ishmael are you a jacob or are you an esau good question because these are the three men that god chose say i'm the god of abraham the god of isaac the god of jacob but yet when you zoom down unto the life of these three men what you would expect to see is perfection and beauty consistency solidity just a a a a a family men of great faith men of great exploits men of greatness but what you find is three very simple men who were ridden with mistakes and failures and hang-ups and issues and problems and lies and schemes and theft amen and these are the three that god says i'm the god of abraham isaac and jacob he said brother matt what did they have why would god choose them they weren't good men abraham uh we can go through the list of what abraham and his mistakes that he made go through the list of the mistakes that isaac made go through the list of some of what jacob was in so much that jacob had to get a name change because he was a screen he was a schemer but what was it it wasn't that they were good men then what separated them from the rest of the world it's because they were men who believed amen what is the true faith seed is it the the conduct or the behavior is so much greater than the rest of the world that god esteems them because they're conduct no it's because they have the ability to believe god abraham believed god and it was accounted unto him for righteousness jacob was a man you see god could do a lot more god could do more through a man who will believe than a good man wow amen because there's a lot of good people who are good but can't believe and if god can just get a man to believe it doesn't matter how good or how bad or how ugly he is if the man will just believe in god look at look at this even this one life turn back to genesis chapter 32 and and and we're just going to cover this just here for a moment a place where jacob comes to where he wrestles with the lord it's where he made it makes a total surrender to god it's where he gets his character not just his motive character but he's actually god is going to completely re-identify this man with a whole new name because what's it going to speak of that god is going to mold the character what's god after he says i if i can i don't need to we don't need to conform you we don't need to reform you to reform your works if but if we can conform you into the image that's why we read romans chapter 8 and it's such a good scripture it says and we know that all things work together for the good to them that love god to those who are called according to his purpose for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son conformed the character molded and jacob's going to come to this place where he has to surrender completely and get a new name it's the place where he casts down his last idol where he gets not just a victory but he gets the victory amen you know there's a very important place you've got to get to in your life where you don't just get a victory you get the victory and brother brandon preached on this and he preached on the v day when you really get a real victory in your life to where you live above sin brother matt do you still are you still tempted are you preaching on perfection no not preaching on that you'll never be perfected in this body but there is a place you can live above sin amen i'm so glad and he passes notice this place the name of this place genesis 32 if you could put that on the screen verse 22. let's just read one verse here genesis 32 and verse 22 and he rose up that night and took his two wives to women's servants as 11 sons and he passed over the ford jaybuck i guess that's how you'd pronounce that word he passes go back there he passes over the ford jaybuck that jaybuck means a place of passing it's also stands for a struggle or it means to empty this is important god is going to pass you have jacob pass over the fort of jacob of jabec it means to empty yourself completely amen to empty yourself completely to be poured out to be poured out this is what jacob meant it's a place where god pours you out of yourself or you're poured out of yourself where you get out of the way of yourself where you empty out yourself a place of passing over and it's it's amazing because he comes to this place go to the next verse verse verse 23 we'll just read it and he took them and sent them over the book and sent over that he had now jacob comes to this crisis in his life where he's he's got god behind him chasing him and he's got and he's a good up to this point he's a good man he's he's uh he's already matured a lot from the day that he deceives his brother and steals the birthright but but god has done many things and he's in this crisis of his life you know it's like a it's like for a believer you gotta we we you know you've got it you've got to come to this red sea experience where you come out of the world and we all come out of the world and we come out of egypt and then you have the crossing of jordan and jordan's like a type of of of of of uh a dying to yourself you come out of egypt you come out of the world and then jordan's a place of death where you die to yourself and you enter into the promised land you're baptized in the name of jesus you read your bible you pray you're in a relationship with the lord but jabec represents something different than jordan it represents something different than than the red sea it's a death or an emptying or a pouring out or a giving over as the prophet said a dying out of your own character amen to where you stop making excuses for who you are you know how many times i've we've made that excuse well that's just i just can't help it that's just the way that i am you know that's just how i was that's just how i just got this tendency you know you know what you know where you know what jabek does jabek that place of jabek empties you out of all of those excuses it empties you out of all of your own dynamo and all of your own self because you you see as as righteous as jacob had became up to this point we're using him for example because god identifies himself with this man i'm the god of abraham isaac and jacob but it wasn't going to be this jacob it wasn't going to be this this man who was who was had matured as we said he'd gotten a lot of victory let me just find the scripture that i was going to read even even one that i had i had read earlier where the bible says yes that that jacob look at verse 24 go to go to the next verse and it says and jacob was left alone and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day and jacob was left alone you know when you come to this place you're at the red sea you got all the crowds of people with you get all the cheering of the audience you got the prophet there you got everybody you got you got jordan what is it there you have the priest and there you have joshua but here it's just you and god wow that's when you wrestle you know jacob was really wrestling he wasn't really wrestling you know who the man he wrestled a man you know who the man was is him that was the real man that needed to be defeated amen jacob was wrestling with himself it came to a place in his own life and it was a place where he reflected when he looked down inwardly and the bible says he was left alone who's going to die here jacob's going to die here it's a place where he could have death to jacob or it wasn't going to be jacob and god it was going to be a prince israel a prince that has prevailed with god he's going to come to the end of himself he's going to die as brother adam said he's going to lay aside his own nature lay aside his own character lay aside his own ways of thinking you know even as a believer even as a holy ghost field filled with the spirit christian you can get to the place to where you can almost in your own self excuse yourself for how you are i'm a believer i know i love the lord i've been filled with the spirit of god but yet you still want to carry some of your own ways and some of your own thinking and some of your own attitudes my i just i studied this today looking at the life of jacob and i just kept hearing the words of brother branham when he would when he was talking about god molding him and and there he is losing his his daughter and his and his wife and brother adams just says there was just too much of of william branham still alive yeah and god had to crush it out and crush it out and what is what does it mean to get the real character of the uh of the character of christ it's when god can say i'm not just here to reform you i'm not just here to reform and take all of the ways that you think and all of the ways that you were formed and i'm going to transform it and reform it god says no i want to completely remove you and i want to place me i don't just want to change and give you a new spirit and but keep the old you i want to completely annihilate all of you and crush all of you so that i can come through you i can be reflected so that the word can reflect itself through you amen it's got to be a complete sense surrender a complete dine out to yourself we read this many times i think i've read it here one one of the time before brother brad if you can put that powerpoint up on the screen i wasn't debated within myself to read this but i'm just going to read it go through it very quickly because i want you to see what real character forming molding looks like listen to what brother branham says here and standing in the gap he says one night the lord woke him up now this is speaking of about uh uh you'll understand some of this you go to the next slide uh brother baby he says one night the lord woke him up one morning we were sitting i looked in jerusalem lord's communion table i was talking he couldn't understand it brother roy setting present looking at me right now i saw and he called me up in houston out or out in arizona sent me a letter and i called him back he said you were sitting there brother branham and i saw that big pillar of light come in and get you and take you away from the lord's table and you went westward because he was sitting on the east side watching me go west and this light come in and taken me out said it was one morning like it was a vision got up in the bed about three or four o'clock in the morning something like that and saw this happen and he said he screamed looked like for days brother bill come back and roy and i have been real brothers we live together hunt together we're just brothers he screamed for me till he was hoarse in his throat come back bring him back bring him back crying he said here come that pillar of fire coming back or a cloud come back and he set me at the head of the table and notice what brother madam says and i had been changed it was a mystery to brother roy me being changed to look different i lay this up here for something i want to remember brother branham lays this up here as a note a little sticky note and and what's written on it being changed wow now it's very something you may not think when you read this you think of some supernatural sphere that brother adam's talking about like a transfiguration it's not at all what he's what he's going to refer to but he says you look different me being changed to look different i'll leave this up here for something i remember being changed when i give him the interpretation of it now brother branham is going to give him the interpretation of an oh oh how it means something so different than what brother roy probably even thought now i'm preaching this to myself could we stand notice now i'm preaching this to myself in this could we stand and see a human being that's blind physically blind and know that he's walking over a cliff could we in our stall stay stale is what brother and i'm saying there's stall state of mind that we're in this morning can we stand and see a blind man walk over a cliff blind and not try to warn him it would be there would be so cruel we would be so indifferent in our heart could you imagine a person getting so indifferent that he could almost laugh and see a blind man that couldn't see can't see can't help himself deliberately walk over a cliff it would be a bad thing to do nothing but now everybody look this way look this way mute that for me brother brad just press b it'll blank it if you you can make it full screen if you press b the key on the keyboard you got to press start slideshow though again now listen to what brother branham says could you imagine seeing a man blind walking over a cliff and not say anything about it he says how indifferent of a person you'd have to be what a bad thing well now listen to what he says here put it back up if you could brother brad well to me to my brethren world over i just want to get it go to go to slide show go to slideshow uh play play from play from current slide over one nope there you go that's fine that's all right nope nope nope you have to go back up up ah yeah that's it right there and he says what to my brother look here at the bottom world over i just want to make this confession humbly say it that that that just about what i was doing or fixing to do as this is honest it's transparent here brother branham uses an example of letting them blind men walk over clifford and other men says that's that's all i had gotten to such a place that's just what i was about to do i had been preaching for years notice i had been preaching for years and i become an old man an old veteran preacher and had a lot of hard battles and maybe i'm scarred all cut up on the inside from fights because my lot that the lord gave me was not back to kiss the babies and to marry the young and bury the old but it was to hold a two-handed sword at the battlefront against the wiles of paganism and demonology and the powers of darkness and fight it with the word of god till i seen the enemy defeated i been cut deep he's confessing of his own self this is this is this is his own character he says because of all the battles that i had went through he says i was so indifferent in my heart i could watch a blind man almost a deaf man not even know the danger was coming he said and not even say anything to him i became so indifferent in my own heart and he says i'd been preaching became a he says it wasn't for me to kiss the babies and bury the dead but i had to wield a two-edged sword and he says i had been cut deep many times now i met a man listen to this i met a man was a christian and he's got a great country right under alaska and i had made up my mind that being that i had left here and gone west that i would take my wife and kind of trap her into something i'd get her up there and i'd become a guide and then if the lord wanted me to do something i'd let my hair grow out i'd have my whiskers and i'd go back in there and be a guide there's only about two or three indians live back in the country there i'd just be a guide i'd help bud and if the lord wanted me to do anything i'd say all right lord it give me a vision i would slip on out and he says then i'm being a nervous i say this kind of quietly maybe a neurotically type of person that i am knowing that i was insufficient at the beginning for the job ever felt that way you ever felt that way you'd be real transparent tell me what this is the prophet of god being laying a book wide open nothing to hide and he says you know from the beginning and he says i just knowing that i was insufficient at the beginning for the job as many as complained i had to do it it was hard but i thought god why didn't you call somebody that could have done it and i'm sorry but i failed the people just won't listen to me and i failed to do what i should have done somewhere because they won't listen my mother that's just passed on into glory about a little over a year ago my mother her father was a hunter i think i got all that come out from him in that stand because i love the woods i thought if this people that call themselves christians if they don't want to listen to the message that i'm preaching then let them alone i'll just stop it all together and i'll go up into the mountain and i know a friend to wear you know what he was doing his reasoning within his own self justifying his own complex and he says if they're not going to listen i'll just just just you know lord i was never even called to i was never going gonna be sufficient anyway you should have chosen somebody else lord i don't even know why you called me i can't even finish the job i've just i'm just gonna say i failed and he says i'll just stop it all together i'll go up into the mountain i know a friend and brother branham says before leaving here i might drop this in and well hurry i dreamed a funny dream an odd dream and i hope when my brother-in-law gets a hold of this it doesn't hurt his feelings and i hope i don't hurt my wife who is setting present now but she knows it about many months ago right on well it was around about october november i dreamed that i was roaming out in the dark and well i i had no place to go nobody cared for me and i had become a bum just a bum and i was cold and i looked in the distance and saw a fire and when i got over there it was a city dump and they had ditches and the fire was in these ditches and between the ditches was slick where bums he says where bums would sleep there to keep warm keep from freezing between these fires on a cold winter night and i was cold and i walked up to this fire to get warm and it was laying full of bums and they were i didn't see any of them but they all like had stalls or places where their sleeping place was and i saw my brother-in-law fletcher broy and when i woke up before i woke up fletch said to me he said in the dream he said billy i'll hunt you a place brother bill you fed my children when they were hungry you was a daddy to them now i'll find you a place here to keep warm and we went walking by the bums places and finally come to a place he said i'll sit down here and i said i'll walk up here and see if i could find a place and i walked up and looked out in the dark cold night and i thought think of it one time god almighty let me lead his church one time he let me preach his gospel and see souls saved men and women come from around the world to speak with me for a few minutes and here i am now a bum and nobody wants me and i'm cold what must i do then i woke up now brother branham inserts this this this vision this dream that he has and he and listen just listen to what he says here next next slide there he says i told my wife i said maybe it means that fletch is in need so we hurried up to see if he says what must i do then i woke up let me okay i got it here maybe fletch is in need so we hurried up to see if we could find him and his his brother found him so i come back down from canada with fred and them the other day in my mind i had it made up if these people didn't want to hear my message all right they didn't have to i had preached now for about 35 years and the last 15 to 18 years i've done nothing but just to the lord i've tried to live so close to him and not say a word till he told me first everything then i come down from canada and fred or brother roy told me his dream he and i brother banks rode along together just before we separated i say the people i never regarded myself anybody knowing this but people have said brother brandon the lord called you to be his prophet well i've never regarded myself as that but i begin i begin to get to the time that i was about ready to do it to think well maybe i am if i am i'll live back in the wilderness and if i'm live back in the wilderness then i'll be his prophet see and then if he wants to send me somewhere while he's not using me then i'll i'll sure catch some fine fish and do some things of course that was kind of a selfish attitude see because i wanted to do that amen you know how quickly the devil will get you to justify now listen this isn't sin he's not saying he's not saying uh uh lord i just give up and you know these are you know these people won't listen to me i gave it my best for uh 15 18 years now lord i just been doing everything i've been giving it my all lord but you know what it just didn't work no one's listening uh that no one's changing and so you know what he doesn't say i'm just going to go i'm just going to turn my back i'm going to go back to the you know to the world i'm going to go to the bars no he's he's coming up with a nice little plan a little plan b amen amen sort of like david and zick like remember when he goes to zick lagoon he just checks out of the pressure from saul and he teams up with the philistine and then loses almost loses his wife and all of his kids and all of his men's kids what a mess because it was a plan b there's a plan b he just sort of figures it out as he goes lord i'm just gonna go here i'll just you know i'll just catch many fine fish and you know when you have a message if i'm a prophet you know i'll just come out storm out of the wilderness and get my message and then go back into the woods he says kind of selfish and he says because that's i wanted to do that now it isn't just exactly the thing that's to do and now i had that made up in my mind to do that i got up at about four o'clock got started driving billy was sleeping we went into a place and i was thinking on my mind you know what one of these days as soon as i can get the wife up there i won't tell her what i'm going to do i just get up there and then i'm going to tell her i love this place so well no need of us going anywhere else let's just stay here and that's that's back from civilization 1100 miles from anywhere way on the wilderness i thought won't that be fine i won't have to get a haircut i won't have to dress up i'll just be a regular mountaineer what i always wanted to do now do you know why he got to this place because he couldn't get people to listen imagine amen imagine because he couldn't get people to conform to change to listen he's just ready to give up he says i won't even have to dress i won't have to comb my hair i want to do nothing i'll just have a message and i'll preach it to the people and i'll go back and he says he says won't that be fine a regular mountaineer would always want to be i said i got some guns some people give me i'll be a guy like you never heard of i'll just love it then if the lord tells me to go down and tell somebody something i'll run out and tell them come back again and i'll help bud and we'll have a real place here i love how he says i was thinking on that like brother i'm saying oh man i was just wow what what what it could be yeah amen what it could be i was just thinking on that it said listen to what the holy spirit says next slide it said carry out your plans and you'll be like that i said lord i don't want to be like that it said your wife will go too she won't live up there in them hills like that and you'll become a bum just as the dream showed you you would i said i don't i don't want to be but i i don't want to have to live like that i want to do something different but i was told that you had called me to be a prophet and i want to live in the wilderness like the prophet but i was using my own excuse so i could hunt my own good you know what you know what you're seeing you're not seeing the character of christ reflected you're seeing the character of william branham it's good character wasn't sinful wasn't a bad idea wasn't to go back to the world it but it was the human this is what i'm talking about this is what jabek took out of jacob it took jacob out of jacob amen it wasn't that brother branham was evil it wasn't that he had evil thoughts but there was still too much of william branham in william branham's thinking brother brandon says i was using my own excuse i was using my own excuse so i can hunt he says now listen to what he says i let the sick lay i want the lord to tell me where to go and not to that's wrong i had built myself a complex because the people didn't hear my message and you god forbid that i'll try to compare the life of now like moses but it's exactly what moses did that people wouldn't listen to him when he come to deliver them so he just left him alone went into the wilderness but god turned him around and he had long forgot the suffering people and these rickeys and raketas that have so sassed the word i've called them ricky and raketa god give me to understand i shouldn't do that because that's many of them are still his children they can't help listen to what he says he says i'm a they can't help because they act so much different some of these old cold formal churches has got them that spirit upon them they're in as much in prison as israel was in prison just as much as moses went down to deliver them from slavery human beings that loved jesus christ would serve him if they only know what to serve him by and they're in bondage under denominationalism that tells them don't you do this and don't you do that but the call of god must come whoever wants to march towards the promised land let him march or own our road to the promised land amen let them come march we're on our road to meet christ at the end time and i wanted to bring this to you why have i been transparent why have i played it all out there brother adam says i wanted to bring this to you so that you would see and show you the mistake that a man can make yet being sincere moses lost the feeling of his people because they wouldn't listen to him and brother roy now here's that dream and brother roy you see your dream and now i can't cannot go with a ministry like that until i feel different in my heart about it no matter if god did tell me but that is that change that brother roy seen coming transfigured body change no all it was was the character of a man dying and the character of christ coming forth amen that was the character that's what brother roy seen in his dream brother and sitting at the head of the table he says you were different you were different brother branham brother branham says something's got to change me because i in my own heart if i go out there feeling the way i do now i still feel that they ought to have heard that message they ought to have done it and i don't have the feeling for the people that i should have until i can get that feeling there's no need of me going because i'd be a hypocrite all these years i've tried to serve him with a true heart and i won't go out there being a hypocrite i've got to feel that that it isn't ricky's and raketa it isn't this bunch it's god's children that's in bondage and i must go into them until i can feel that way i'll just have to loaf around preach some conventions and things but wait god bless you each one listen to the next slide we hope to see you again real soon till then will you do me this one favor both here and on tape brethren pray that god will place into my heart that's something that i lost out there in that complex so easy to build a complex i took the time to read that because you can see the character wasn't sin something sinful jordan takes care of that you die to yourself but you've got it empty to have character of jesus i have the character of messiah what you've got to do you've got to come to jabek just like jacob and wrestle with yourself and die to yourself what was jacob what was it going to represent a complete death to jacob to where he wouldn't be called jacob anymore he'd be called israel and the bible says that he limped notice this here as we close we're at 8 40. just give me give me just a few minutes i won't take 20. okay give me about five it's wednesday i can't i can't take 20. so jacob comes now listen he had many ways look at uh pull up genesis 32 if you could verse 10. we read it you okay is everybody all right can we go just a few more minutes he says oh god i am this is genesis 32 verse 10. he says i'm not worthy of the least of all thy mercies and of all thy truth which thou has shown unto thy servant so notice this isn't a sinful man this man had had an experience even even at bethel you remember the dream that he has the dream where he sees the latter and angels of sinning and descending it's a man who's had experiences he's had an experience with god already i hope you catch this everybody young and old alike this wasn't a sinner coming to coming to repentance jacob turned into israel as not a sinner coming to repentance it's a man who's already came to god in an ex by an experience a religious experience but now god is going to take him from a religious experience he's going to take him from a gift and he's going to introduce him to the giver of that gift and he's going to meet not just the get not just the get not just the gift he's going to meet the giver and he's going to be changed permanently not a temporary change not a one-time experience that one time experience jacob goes from bethel from that one time experience and then and then dwells in shechem and and all we've preached on that before and all of the this sin that comes into jacob's life and the consequences of bad decisions wasn't was wha what happened brother matt what happened was is that you can have a good religious experience you could have a good experience in god but it can only be a skin-deep experience maybe it's just an emotional experience and you've experienced god in some kind of way but let me just ask you have you been changed from you from the creature that you once were have you died out to yourself do you see the character of the messiah reflecting in your life when you look at the mirror of god's word or do you still see too much of jacob he has an experience in bethel but this was going to be different this was going to be different this is where god was going to deal with sin god was going to deal with pride god was going to deal with his his his his sinful self he was going to give a death blow a final blow to jacob being jacob the bible says he says i am not worthy of the least of these listen to this obedient prayer and he says having shown that i serve for with my staff i passed over this jordan and now i am become two bands i'm gonna have to hurry and to skip through some of this here he comes to this place of complete surrender he comes to a crisis you know sometimes god has to get you to a crisis in your own life to where there's no there's no going back there's no going forward there's no way to to check out with distractions but you've got to face it you've got to face yourself and jacob had to face himself he was forced to completely be exposed no more hiding no more running no more excuses the bible says be sure your sins will find you out and jacob it came to a conflict a confrontation he wasn't going to get out of he wasn't going to get out of this one he wasn't going to buy his way out it wasn't going to trick his way out he wasn't going to sell her he wasn't going to scheme like he had been doing but now jacob comes face to face face to face genesis chapter 32 look there as we just read this together in genesis 32 verse 26 let's go to genesis 32 make sure i have that right verse 24 and jacob was left alone i think that's symbolic of something there's nobody there just you in the lord amen you and all of you 100 of you all of your faults all of your good all of your bad there's nothing hidden it's all exposed before the lord and jacob was left alone and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day he was forced to expose himself to see himself for what he was for all that he was god didn't need to know but jacob needed to see jacob for who he really was that's why he asks him what his name was god knew exactly who his name was but god's trying to get jacob to realize something jacob look at who you are see yourself for who you really are see yourself for who you really are and he said unto him what is thy name verse 27 and he said jacob scheister schemer suplanter a cheater because that's what he was but this is this is god saying i want you to i want you to don't think of anybody else don't think of your don't think of your past don't think of your family don't don't think of what happened to you when you're a child don't think of what happened to you that was out of your control don't think of the bad the incidents don't think of all your mistakes just look at you jacob think of you for one moment let go of everything else let go of everything else in your life jacob let go of everything what is your name and he said jacob look at yourself jacob expose yourself to you make sure you understand who you are you know sometimes we need to do that friends to realize that there is none good but god there's nothing good in us there's nothing good in you there's nothing we can give to the lord nothing no human works that god wants no human ability that god wants he just wants it all all of you mind body soul spirit surrendered and then god can reflect his character through your life he can't reflect him as long as i'm in the way i say lord don't let me be in the way don't let me be a hindrance he says next next verse there verse 28 and he said thy name shall be called no more jacob but israel for has a prefer as a prince thou has power with god and with men and has prevailed praise the lord and then god says in verse 29 notice this here and jacob asked him and said tell me i pray thee thy name and he said wherefore is it thou dost ask after my name and he blessed him right there something had happened he blessed him right there it wasn't it wasn't a blessing it wasn't a blessing it wasn't a materialistic blessing you could receive many materialistic blessings from god jacob had prayed this before even at bethel his prayer if you go and read his prayer it's all about god bless me so i can pay tithes that's literally go read his prayer to god that's what he says he says lord give me money so i can give some back to you you know many times we want the blessing from god god bless my business so that i can bless others well really is that really what you really want if you'd be real or is that pride in your own heart deceitfulness and god says jacob asked him and says tell me i pray thee that name wherefore as thou has asked for my name and he blessed him what does he do he touches notice verse 30 go to the next verse here and jacob called the name of the place pinaya for i have seen god face to face and my life is preserved and he passed and as he passed verse 31 and as he passed over penile the sun rose upon him and he halted upon his thigh it's going to represent something it's going to represent i'm changed forever i'm changed in so much the bible says the children of israel ain't not of the sinew which shrank which is upon the hollow of the thigh to this day because he touched the hollow of jacob's thigh in the sinew that shrank he's so permanently changed that everyone around him could tell something is different when god changes you you don't have to broadcast it you don't have to announce it you don't have to you don't have to publish it when god really changes you everybody can tell your family can tell your husband can tell your wife can tell your parents can tell your church can tell when it's a real work an inward work of the holy spirit your character changes not just your actions not just about your actions that's about what you do or what you don't do but your character that part that needs to be molded that part that needs to reflect that part that that unless you give it unless you give of yourself and surrender yourself and say lord it's i i want to go past jordan i want to go i want to go past the red sea i want to cross alone over jabuk and i want you to change my character permanently lord how many could pray that prayer here today and say lord change me into your character could the musicians come where i can see the reflection where i can look into the mirror of god's word and i could see character coming back reflecting back but you've read this many times brother branham said this we've read it many times you could just play something for me character is a victory not a gift amen a man without character can't reign because power apart from character is satanic but power with character is fit to rule you have to suffer terrain the reason for this is that character simply is never made without suffering that's why the bible says think it not strange concerning fiery trials that are to try you brother branham says is it strange that god wants us to develop stand to your feet with me is it strange that god wants us to develop a christ-like character that comes through suffering he says no sir we all have trials how many could say i got trials how many has been chastened before by the lord he says the church that's not suffering that isn't being chastened that isn't being tried that isn't going through trials doesn't hasn't got it is it from god and he says but the goat of god is a christ-like character produced in the fiery furnace of affliction that's the right kind of gold that's the right kind of gold a christ-like character produced in the fiery furnace of affliction how many could say lord with your head bowed eyes closed could just raise the hand and say lord i want you to produce that kind of character in my life let me lay myself so all of me my thinking my complexes oh as brother adam says there's too much of me still living lord i want to confess that to you here tonight there's too much of me lord you've brought me a mighty long way you've changed me lord many many there's many
