love god it's so important that you do you're thankful to him friends amen i'm sure you are the lord has done so much good for us you know we need to always want to have that kind of an attitude brother branham it's amazing i would have never thought it but uh brother branham said it's so clear he said you know no matter how much i pray in the back and prepare and and actually be anointed myself be under a great anointing he said if i come out and the holy spirit doesn't really feel welcome he feels that resistance he said he just won't move he said i'll preach it'll be all in vain you'll you'll have come out today you'd have been better to go to a football game somewhere at least you could have jumped up and shouted and screamed at something amen praise the lord you love him amen i'm not here to reprimand you today i love you we're happy to be in the house of god today we've got one prayer request we want to take to the lord uh for brother don and sister mary hoffman today so brother jd i got that that's the latest uh that you posted back um there and so we want to just be praying for them sister mary you know with uh with that kind of a compromised immune system that's really the last thing in the world that she needed but the lord's got control of it she's she's pretty much the same at this point brother don is now feeling very fatigued and weak thankfully both of their oxygen counts are still in the normal range praise the name of the lord amen brother mark is really under the weather today the enemy battling him so i want to lift up our brother to the lord this morning in prayer how many have a need also here today say lord remember me my i have a need friends i i need the lord to come on the scene and be the preacher today amen i'm here to do you good but i i i really can't do that i need the lord to come do it amen now if you've come expecting to see me well hey i'm a friendly guy i'll treat you like royalty but for eternal life i can't do a whole lot for you i'd like to you know but uh i have a hard enough time getting me there i don't know way to get you there but i know there is one here who can amen can get you there loves you came and died for you amen and sent a word in this hour to redeem us praise the name of the lord so we're going to turn to chapter 11 and we're going to catch a couple of verses in revelation sorry revelation chapter 11. we're going to continue in my little series here on the coming of the lord uh probably today and maybe one more uh segment we'll do it we'll see amen we'll see amen praise the lord i never really know tell you the truth if i ever sound unsure it's because i am if i sound unsure that's only because i am so uh but we just we just go along as the lord breaks it reveals it to us i don't never get to choose what i preach hope you believe that i don't never get to choose that and there's i could choose now no kidding i could choose but i don't choose because i know better than to try that amen i want what he has amen i made the lord a promise years ago that i would never do that that i would never if i knew it was his will i would do it um there'd be nothing death nothing would keep me from it if i knew if i knew it was his will in his word i would do it no matter what it cost me and um knowingly not knowingly have i ever broken that vow to the lord amen now sometimes i've missed the will of god amen amen sometimes the will of god can be a little obscure trying to see it but buddy you miss it one time and you will you want to you want to know how to know the will of god miss it and you will know right quick uh that you are in left field and you've gone off center line so amen praise the lord but uh but if i ever knew it was his will and the lord i always have to see it in his word he knows that's how i think i know that this word heavens and earth will pass away but this is what he sent me that will never pass away and i know if i can see it here i i trust this more than i trust an angelic visit i trust this more than an open vision i trust this more than anything see because uh an angel could appear to mean it be a be an evil spirit disguised as an angel see i could see a vision you could have a dream brother branham talks about that um got some notes for that working in a future sermon about gifts and operations of gifts in the church and brother branham just goes into such detail to talk about that how that we have gifts but we have to be careful he said because satan is super sly he can come in take a gift take a preaching gift take a we had beautiful specials here this morning you know god can get in singers the enemy can get in singers god can get in preachers the enemy can get in preachers god can get in an audience the enemy can get in an audience musicians singers song leaders preachers officers laity see so we have to always check it by the word and the lord knows that once i see it in the word and it's perfect faith and i'm fearless with it i'll face the whole world face every devil wants to step up i will absolutely do that because i know once i see it in the word i have perfect faith that's it for me it's an end to all strife it's an end to all discussion amen and so we want to be able to have everything established in god's word and so i'm looking to him today to do that uh i don't stand here with any certain um agenda in my heart i'm only here today to continue this thought so it's been thrilling to me i've enjoyed it i trust you have as well to see that revelation 10 has meant a lot more to me in the last several weeks than ever at any point in my life because i see the greater purpose of it not the greater purpose of it but a greater purpose of it there's many great purposes but um what god has done we were preaching on it especially drilling down on it last sunday to show that really friends revelation 10 came to bring a bride into the into the image of christ his very image his very image his precise image and at the end and she's the final voice to the final age i said that you last week remember that there's more verses in revelation 10 referring to you than refer to william branham he was the necessary element in that seventh verse because god's never going to come and bring a revelation to a group he doesn't operate that way he gets a prophet he gives him his message and the prophet takes it to the people you're right you follow that so he was a necessary element standing there in verse 7 when the mighty angel not not the strong angel brother branham was the strong angel of revelation 5 standing in verse 7 when the mighty angel of revelation 10 standing that that brother i'm standing there in verse 7 of chapter 10 when the mighty angel which was christ came but after that verses 8 verses 9 verses 10 verses 11 that's all you see and verse and then chapter 11 one and two especially verse one we're gonna where we've been showing you how that that's the measurable perfection that that's the living tabernacle of the living god that that that revelation 11 verse 1 validates all of chapter 10 that christ was true the messenger was true the message is true and verse 1 of chapter 11 proves it because she was literally the finished product the measurable perfection and it was measurable because the bride comes into his image it's not a metaphor she literally comes into his image perfectly amen so so we're looking further at it today and we want to take these requests to the lord let's let's have our reading in chapter 11 verse 1. and we'll just take this a couple of verses here and there was given me a read like unto a rod and the angel stood saying rise and measure the temple of god and the altar and them that worship therein but the court which is without the temple leave it out and measure it not for it is given unto the gentiles and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty in two months amen let's pray father i stand here this morning lord depending on you relying on you master this thought has been burning in my heart but lord it'll take you to bring it to the people today and i pray you'll grant it father we stand here lord not one of us worthy lord if it was up to our own worthiness we wouldn't even get out of the blocks lord but you're worthy and you have made us worthy lord and we stand today under a blood-stained banner i'm so grateful for that i thank you lord that you have accomplished that for us and so i stand here in faith lord believing that everything that there should be no obstacles now lord if there's anybody lord with any anything not under the blood may they quickly put it under the blood lord for rest assure the word will find it and so lord we want our whole unworthy lives under the blood of the lord jesus christ i pray that that you will grant that to us today and be pleased lord to give us the healing word that we need and father we have sick and afflicted among us we're praying today for the dawn and sister mary hoffman we're praying today for brother mark carter lord we're praying for these saints of god and lord any others that might be sick and feeling uh sick today may the great holy spirit lord do a great wonderful uh power lord by your wonder working power lord in their bodies and may it may that same word which is health to all of our flesh lord strengthen us mind body and soul we commit it to you now in jesus christ's name amen god bless you friends you can be seated by way of an announcement i just want to say to the streaming audience we had quite a delay this morning getting the uh live broadcast going however um the booth assures me the recording is perfectly intact so if you uh missed part of the preliminaries and you want to get that it'll be on the archive we are up and running now jeremiah i believe we are up and running now so praise the lord um lastly i sent you out an announcement about a uh our harvest gathering that's coming up uh you'll see it in the church whatsapp we're looking forward to that it's a little bit scaled back from what we normally do we just had the uh so much going on we had the youth camp and that was such a major undertaking and then we immediately started on church renovations and that's been quite taxing and so so but we still love to do that we love to get together i love being around god's family my every time i get around a a church fellowship like that it starts reminds me of the millennium brother don donald it reminds me of the millennium i think my won't the millennium be wonderful when this is every day hallelujah so we're going to do that i think that's on the 11th and we're looking forward to that so amen all right praise the lord we want now to by the grace of god start in here from where we've been and i've already kind of gave you a preliminary well i had you standing so i want to uh read some not quotes in their entirety i have a powerpoint that i'm going to get to shortly and it has the entire quote of several screens that i want to read but on these quotes i'm just going to skip along and read some statements and some one-liners here i'll give you the message in the reference so you can make a note of it for those of you who like to go back these are wonderful sermons from brother branham and and we're thinking now today about the eternal realms because you know as we think about the brad because as we've been showing you how that you know when when we are shown to be that we are the living temple of the living god now that's a mouthful i mean that's rare anybody can say that but talk is cheap say well then i'll make sure that i live in such a way that i earned that that wouldn't even do you any good either that this all comes back to god's election and i'm here to tell you something friends that what you're what you have done when you have given your heart to the lord as brother branham said you didn't one day come to an altar and repent and oh wow you became a son of god or you became a daughter of god no brother branham says no you only found out you actually had always been from the mind of god and now by the new birth of the holy spirit in your life you're now cooperating in the vision do you know sometimes and and more often now of late but over the last number of years particular people in this congregation uh members of my family which you are included as members of my family i am oftentimes praying for you with these words and this is how the lord inspired me to pray for all of my loved ones lord today today this day may you take brother and sister so and so and all of their family and this day may you bring them just a little closer to the image that you saw of them before the foundation of the world now i pray that because and i pray that for me i pray that for myself because otherwise there'd be too many things in my own experience that would disappoint me and hinder my faith there'd be too many things that would disappoint you there would be things i'd get disappointed in watching you there'd be things disappointed you're watching me but if we just say lord whatever that vision is just bring us closer to that i'm not gonna tell you how to do it i'm not here i just say lord by whatever means necessary bring me bring this church bring our families into the vision that you had of us before the foundation of the world amen now that can go good or bad depending on your resistance you can you can make it easier on yourself or you don't you don't have to god won't force you to make it easier but you are it's like i've told the story you know here's here's the bad guy in the bar you know in the saloon and the marshal comes in with all of his his his deputies and they surround him you know all right ringo you're going to jail now listen son you can go to jail walking upright like a man or you can get pistol whipped to the ground and drug behind a horse it doesn't matter to me but you are going to jail and so i just say today don't don't get drunk behind a horse just go ahead and submit to the holy spirit in your life i promise you'll you'll like it better if you do it that way and so so we find out then that to be this living image this living tabernacle means that there is a bride on the earth at the end time who literally have perfect faith in every word of god for their life because it's you know gentiles have a thing of saying have this kind of thinking do you know do you know something and someone would say yes i know it i know and a gentile would say okay let me hear you recite it back to me and if you can explain it and recite it then gentiles will tend to say okay he knows it go sit down next but hebrews are not like that the jewish people have always had it looking at it like this if if you can live it then i'll say you know it if you actually if it becomes a living reality and it's not just a head knowledge but it's actually a living word out of your life then then the jews will say okay he knows it see and this is this is remember this is how john being a jew is speaking to you when he uses that word that that that that you actually can know god in this way that it goes more than just a head knowledge that it actually when your life is an amen when your life is a is a voice of the word you're the final voice to the final age that's not that's not the the shout god doesn't need me or you to go re interpret the shout and give it out to the world it's already on 1200 tapes it's already verified vindicated and went around the world god doesn't need that redone what god needs now is for a people to become the living voice of that message that's what i want friends that's what i want more than anything that's my constant prayer that's what that's what will drive sleep from me if i feel that that there's more areas i that i could surrender and i won't what a wretched man i feel at that time and i go to god and say lord take over this man take over this flesh and cause me as you promised in your word cause me to believe your statutes cause me said i'll put my spirit in you and i will cause you to keep my statutes so this living image of the living word there's a whole lot i could say about it today but and i i grappled terrible terribly with two ways i wanted to go and i wanted to marry them together and i don't think the lord's gonna have it and so i just finally gave up trying and and i'm just gonna go with this in angle of it today and i'll catch that angle if and when the lord allows that good so so brother branham talks about now because i want to talk about these ethereal realms and these eternal realms and you're really going to have to stay with me tight because we're going to kind of think outside the box today that be okay you're eternal beings right children of god see don't don't don't live in just the three-dimensional world that you know the world presents to you there's seven dimensions actually and you realize today that because you we had a prophet that come and understood these realms having been caught in many of them himself having traveled in them you understand this was a prophet who traveled who went into the fifth dimension and came back who went into the sixth dimension and came back who operated discernment through the ethereal waves of the fourth dimension and could stand in one place and be completely somewhere else while he's standing right here so i'm here to tell you that science today studies all of this and you are here today and it is an absolute fact it's not wishful thinking we're not patting ourselves on the back but i'm here to tell you you understand far more far and running away more about the world and reality and nature and the creation than all the scientists in their ivy league schools put together amen they they look at things and they are puzzled by things that we happen to already know we're smarter than the scientists that's not an arrogant statement it's a matter of statement of fact i'm smarter than astronauts they they've seen things but i know what they're looking at and i know what's even behind what they're looking at amen because when we talk about being the temple of the lord well what does that even mean am i going to be a mortar building brick and mortar building no see then we're inside of a building and this we call it the house of god but this is a building that could be flattened by a storm tomorrow that wouldn't that wouldn't destroy the house of god you understand you you're the house of god but you could perish before tomorrow but that wouldn't stop the house of god from being in existence see so now i want you to go with me today and i and i and i think maybe young people will particularly be intrigued by some of this today but some of the old-timers as well no doubt brother branham with his understanding of these realms he comes in the series demonology in the religious realm he first does the physical realm and then he goes into the religious realm and beginning is 1953 and beginning in paragraph 191 he said here let's give a little picture a little minute little mental picture now i'm not going to read all of the quote he goes to a board and he draws a stream of life and you can catch this from the description if you go home listen to the tape yourself and he says now in this little channel here he just draws a channel across the board in this channel dwells mortal beings you and i and and and and he talks about how that you know in this channel of life as it stands today it's all black lines and folly and evil and everything of human existence is represented in his channel he drew on a board he said and all that blackness and all those streaks of evil going through that he said but now every once in a while he said you'll see a little white light in there and that's god's family moving through the channels of life with the rest of humanity all right you getting a mental picture already i hope so he says so he says now this channel is influenced and in one sense he says from two sides which makes you think he drew a channel like this and it's left and right if you keep going on you realize he drew it like this and when he's talking about sides versus sides he's meaning above and below all right he makes that's extremely clear i don't have time to read it all this morning but he says now this channel of life is influenced all right and now he he will go through that sermon and other sermons that i'm not didn't even put on my notes today but there's several places he talks about this how that there's three realms above this channel of existence you live in and there's three realms below the channel that you live in and he says you're you're influenced in this channel by above or below amen now educated people would go well you can't prove that in a laboratory but i can look out on the street and prove it i can look in my own life and prove it see and so he talks about how that above this channel where we have these light time and matter where those are the first three dimensions we contact and the fourth dimension is the ethereal waves and microwaves and radio waves and tv signals and things like that and that's where brother branham said every fifth dimension disease comes through comes through that fourth dimension so be careful what you're gazing at be careful what you're giving yourself access to in that fourth dimension because fifth dimension sicknesses and demons come through that to go into this realm okay i'm not going to explain that further i just always went i better be careful all right and so so above this middle channel you have the realm of the redeemed where brother branham went to in a sixth dimension and he held people and talked to them and conversed with them and they were real they weren't imagined they weren't a metaphor they they were real so so today all of our loved ones who have died didn't die amen because the for the christian jesus said you will never die this body gets to a point where it can no longer sustain life and it it and this and the spirit of life exits because the body sick or old or whatever can no longer sustain life and the body perishes but the real you lives on and and brother brandon went there and talked to them people he knew that he had visited with in the earth all right i've got to move faster so so from there above that is angels and above that is god all right then below it is that fifth dimension of the the souls of the damned who left the earth and what what happened was they they didn't have the blood of jesus to go all the way into the sixth dimension but their time on they couldn't come back here because their time was all used up and they get hung in that fifth dimension they can't come back here they can't go on into the presence of the redeemed and they're hung there at a nightmarish tight prisons not the lake of fire but it isn't but it is it is described as as a as a terrible place brother branham said the worst nightmare you could ever imagine and jesus gives the parable of the man saying i'm tormented in this flame we know by the bible that that no one is committed to the lake of fire without getting their fair trial and so people are held there bound over for trial now that's a legal term we understand people go get put in jail and he's bound over for trial he's locked up and they're not going to give him any bail he's just bound over for trial and there have been people bound over for trial there for thousands of years waiting for waiting for i doubt they're even very much recognizable as a human probably the madness that they've slipped into at this point i don't know i've never been there don't want to go but but then on down below that realm is the realm of demons and then on down below that is satan himself and so brother branham says we're in the middle and we're caught i told sister gene the other day i said when people ask me do you believe in purgatory i said yep i'm in it now i'm in the middle this is the closest thing to purgatory i'll ever ever want to go i'm here to tell you something friends i'm going up i'm not going down now that's also not a metaphor up and down are real jesus went up after he first went down and went into the lower part so i don't want to get ahead of myself but we're influenced in our lives from one of these two realms below above or below you disremember that teenagers when you feel a certain leadership and a guidance or anybody ask yourself where is this influence coming from if it's something that it will improve your connection to god i'm pretty sure the devil would never influence you to do it if it's something that would draw you away from the presence of god i'm quite sure the holy spirit would never draw you to do that all right so brother branham is answering the question about the the medium and the woman who speaks to to to spirits and brother branham is proving that he says that what that woman done she broke into that realm she is speaking to those demon-possessed men who were beginning the spirits of those fallen angels that repented not back yonder in the beginning and allow their beings to be possessed of them and they're waiting for judgment see over here are influenced and born again by the spirit of god today that these these mediums these seance people they cannot break into that realm and get a righteous man out of that realm he couldn't do it because righteous men see righteous men are not where they used to be in paradise they used to be down in the lower regions of the earth and a segmented place called paradise which god did away with after he after jesus resurrected them out and took them into the throne room of god amen amen and so you once they're in that land of the redeemed you're not going to get them back here in a seance if you're talking to someone dead i promise you you're not connecting to someone in glory amen that's impossible see and so brother branham talks about when jesus died he went and preached to the souls that were in prison he goes on in 57 as the eagles stir with her nest those prophets went so high now just listen to this language those profits went so high what does that mean they went so high all right let's think about this they went so high they could see things are far off to come he says god does his prophets they raise up the eagles of god has flew so high into the stratospheres of god all right that he says until they see they've seen that day coming and they've dropped back down and pinned it off on the bible and somehow somehow when you become into that realm you can feel that there's something coming something makes us hunger brother brown talks about the animal kingdom who don't have a soul they have no concept of desiring a place of peace and rest and comfort like we say oh for heaven oh for the millennium see an animal just is all stimuli he eats and he'll jump up and down for you and bark when you can train him to do different things but he has no concept that there's a land beyond the river that they call the sweet but we do see because you have a soul we long to be there we where something in us tells us this can't be how it all should be there's something broken and i need something repaired i need to go somewhere all right so he goes on in 1960 in the patmos vision now is this is this the one no okay carry let me let me just catch these before i start on my powerpoint so in the patmos vision he he starts talking about how that god you know he crushed death and hell and the grave and sickness and formalities and everything and overcome it all and rose on the third day and conquered all the conquered all the atmospheres now watch this because this word atmospheres you remember when john is baptizing and the the bible says the spirit of god descended like a in the bodily presence of a dove and a voice spoke from heaven and trinitarians say see speaking from heaven and they always just think of heaven and brother branham says well actually what it says in the original language is god spoke from the atmospheres and brother branham would say there's atmospheres between you and me so you don't always just think of somewhere in alpha centauri or the misty blue or way over the rainbow okay the bible says he be not far from us all the bible says we're coming to a time this was in the era of the holy ghost where we are now when there won't be anyone saying somebody cross the sea and go bring god back to us or somebody go up to heaven and go bring him down to us because the age of the holy ghost brings the kingdom of god within you and brother branham says that with the sacrifice of the lord jesus heaven and earth embraced and kissed see he makes another statement here he says he he um he crushed the grave in sickness and formalities and overcome it all and rose on third day and conquered all the atmospheres above now listen and cut the mist between god and man and connected heaven and earth together he says in is anything too hard for god he says abraham knew inside you know that that he said you know when he when he met those men and lot said my lords but abraham said my lord and they both saw the same thing and they were all just human abraham wasn't any more or less a human than lot was why did lot misinterpret and see three but abraham caught it correctly and only saw one and he said my lord he saw three men but only one of them was the one he was ready to worship see and brother branham said abraham knew there was something real the spirit declared it why now here it is you ready you want this you want this secret intel you want this insider trading info of how to discern he said he kept himself in a spiritual atmosphere all the time that he could recognize right from wrong all the time amen amen he says that's the way the christian ought to do today is keep yourself prayed up under a spiritual atmosphere see always never seeing the bad side look to the good side your children of god expect his blessings oh don't look to the bad side don't pay attention to doom and gloom don't worry about symptoms look to a promise stay in the atmospheres of god expect good things see he said in 1960 last year in 1960 from the message it is i oh there it is if you knew who was talking to you see and and jesus now he's got jesus at the at the woman at the well the scripture that brother branham went to more than any other scripture in discernment lines more than any probably the second one would probably be hebrews 13 8 but he goes to the woman at the well in discernment lines more than makes that reference in connection he says now i'm just a man here's a woman she's standing before me he says now it's just a scene of saint john all right and he goes here and so so he she's she's in a conversation and and she says we know here's what i know by the reading i've been taught i was in sunday school we know when messiah cometh i i have that much education i'm still a i'm still a harlot but i do have an education of the word i it had not done anything for my life see because it was just in her head but but there was a seed down inside there all she needed to do was come in contact with the living word amen see so so she says here but jesus said if you knew she says we know the messiah is coming he says if you knew who you were talking to she said you know you're asking me for a drink he said but if you knew who you was talking to you'd ask me for one see and i'd give you water that you never thirst again he says i'm sure if every sinner in here feeling the presence and the atmosphere now this is an amazing statement and it's very common to you ex feeling the presence and the atmosphere of setting together tonight in heavenly places in christ jesus and that little feeling that's telling you if you knew who you were talking to if you really caught a vision when you say i'm sitting together in heavenly places that's a little bit of a of of of of a gordian not if from your human mind because you're not in heaven i'm here on the earth i wish i was in heaven and i know god is in heaven somewhere and i'm kind of down here but actually the bible is saying through the work of the holy spirit you here in this channel there's some part of you in heavenly places in the presence of god it doesn't matter if the whole world's blowing up around you in your little channel there's a more real you that has access to say father and you don't need a bull horn and you don't need a walkie-talkie and you don't even have to shout no one even needs to hear it you can just back up in a time of trouble and say lord and the lord is immediately don't have to wait for him to get there there's no there's no uh internet lag here immediately yes my son because you're that's where you live i live in his presence see and so now he comes to the true easter seal all right uh brother josh we're going to go with advancing slides now the coming of the lord part 4. i want to put this up because it's lengthy and i want to read it all you'll be advancing my slide sir all right let's go and so this is the living temple of god's presence 1961. let's go the true easter seal now we are sitting together in heavenly places in christ jesus now we realize that jesus the body of jesus was caught up from the resurrection now we know that the bible speaks of three heavens we know it first heaven second heaven third heaven i believe it was paul was called away in the third heaven and seen things that wasn't expedient for him to speak of them next now the first heaven is called in the scripture like the clouds in other words down below here on the earthly seal now when that atmosphere from up and above the clouds becomes down into the church that's a heavenly place then the second heavens is considered the solar system and the third heavens goes beyond that now watch now we just happen to think just watch this a minute now einstein proved by scientific that if two objects was coming to each other like two cars coming down across the road and if they were coming fast enough now they'd really have to be going fast like a you know like a billion miles per second but they could pass right through one another and never disturb a thing now i'm expanding your mind i'm expanding what you think of as reality all right next the speed would do it pass them right through one another without disturbing anything now if you'll notice i was standing here not long ago at mount however you pronounce that in california and i was noticing there that telescope that can see a hundred and twenty million light uh light space now think 120 million years of light space how many miles that would be to be broke down see next but yet heaven is so many billions and billions and billions of light years beyond that till it's not even thought of how would we get there it's the travel it will be like the mind it's so fast it'll be faster if you can think of heaven that's how quick you'd be there amen that's how quick you'd be there all right but after he was resurrected back up a screen okay carry on all right jesus after he was resurrected came oh yeah right through walls right through the doors and stood and eat boiled fish and honeycomb hallelujah speed no sooner than life has gone out of this body we're in the presence of god yonder we only know as feet and inches and yards and miles and so forth we're in this earthbound system but when we leave here brother oh my what a time [Music] all right josh take that down so now when we start thinking about this now i'm coming to because i've got to come to it otherwise i i one of the things as i was studying this today uh that i thought you know i've got to make this i got to connect a dot otherwise this is just so what preaching and i don't ever want to be guilty of that i've seen preachers do that where they speak of all these and you're everybody's like oh and you leave there and nobody even knows what was said or what's the value of it and i just call it so what preaching you know what value does it really have so today i'm trying to connect you all to something all right so just stay with me so now in science today and a lot in science fiction but yet they don't realize that it's not as fiction as they think it is but but actually there's a whole uh a whole discussion of what they term in these days as parallel worlds in parallel universe and they see it as stacked realities now they don't what they don't know is they're actually very close to the truth amen you see that just just like for instance just like for instance when you leave here you don't die you just go to another world and you're still alive and now einstein is proving that if there's enough speed that that matter can pass through matter solid objects and not disturb the molecules at all we travel like a thought now if you ever think about traveling like a thought it's really then in heaven when you travel like a thought then distance is relative because it wouldn't matter it's still just a thought so if i want to go from here to that door it would take me 10 or 12 seconds to get back there because it's only 40 feet but if i wanted to go 40 miles that's going to take me a whole lot longer you see and but in heaven whether something is 40 feet or 4 gazillion miles if that's a term i think it and i'm there so there's a whole difference in the time space continuum listen friends god is amazing amazing and a lot of times we we can get so narrowly focused down into here to our lives that we just walk around in a little shoebox like we're like animals just reacting to stimuli and you know and you lose sight of the fact that wait a minute i i i'm not i i'm an eternal creature there's way more waiting on me this is just a training ground this life even about this life it's all about the next one that's a that's an amazing freeing liberating mindset to have because then no matter what the devil does that the lord allows you can just look the devil in the face and say it don't matter and you don't matter i come from god i'm going back to god and there's nothing you can do about it satan even i can't do anything about it see and so so we realized that the whole thing of realms above and realms below and we're actually in the middle because if you think about it now and i'm not here to define everything please don't think that everything i'm teaching is defined uh doctrinal positions i'm just i'm just trying to free your mind a little bit because i'm coming to something all right so so you know when brother branham let me give you some things to think about you remember brother branham in the sage field and he saw jesus and he says jesus was just a little bit a little bit up in the air and he said now bro the question was was he real or am i having a dream or is it but brother branham said i noticed that when the wind blew the sage it blew his garment also and he said i i actually turned around trying to get his attention kept going trying to clear my throat ah you know and and finally he just says jesus and he turns and looks and he says that's the last thing i remember till the next morning i woke up and my pajamas were wet with the dew he says there's no way to paint those eyes he said where when you look at his eyes it's like you want to burst into tears he said but yet it also had the look that if he would speak the world would end amen and so this is our god this is who we are in us in in marriage with this is the being that your life here is not just a normal life and what we read in chapter 11 is not just a metaphor there's a bride coming to something amen amen i'm here to tell you friends our future's bright our future is bright so you know jesus when he left mount carmel ascended up into a clan the bible says a cloud received him see the old testament saints ascended up out of paradise and walked around in the channel walked around in the channel after coming out of paradise and then it was just a little whistle stop because they already had bodies the channel couldn't hold and they just said and abraham says lord do you care if we make a little whistle stop i'd like to see the old city been been how many hundred years since abraham had walked the walked in the channel in the middle and sure and so they're they're they're going down streets and going down looking at this and look at that and brother branham just dramatizes it i'm glad he was a prophet otherwise we'd think he was nuts but but but when when a prophet sometimes when a prophet sees things friends you just say my what kind of eyes is he looking through i know this much john saw a pillar of fire that nobody else saw i know that paul saw a light no one else saw you see and so so we find that that abraham says oh sarah wait duck back said i think we've been recognized we better go and they were gone brother branham went from this dimension that you live in right now and he walked into the sixth dimension through a dimensional doorway that had moments before ben his bedroom wall and suddenly it's a portal and he says it it was just a little rise it wasn't a great big mountain it's just a just a grassy and he said it just rose a little bit and he literally walked from here and just up a little grassy rise and coming over he said was all of these redeemed and hugging him and screaming our precious brother he didn't walk to the to alpha centauri he didn't leave and go you know across the sea or he he got up out of his bed and walked the distance of his room and stepped through a door and was there and and turned around and looked back and saw his body am i expanding your mind today see so so we find then that brother branham speaking of hell and i i didn't get the references but i looked at them today to make sure i had it straight and brother branham there's numbers of references where brother branham makes this reference about you know people who think there's no hell that hell's not real and brother branham said it's a churning right under you right now see so so you mean down inside the earth is where hell is i'm i'm i'm here to tell you is all i can tell you i can tell you that that he that ascended into the cloud first descended into the lower parts of the earth and preached to souls in prison i'm quite sure it's dimensional i'm quite sure you couldn't dig a hole and go find them there you understand you'd hit lava before you'd ever find anybody and you wouldn't even get to lava i forget how many thousands of miles it's down and so so but but we do find that there is an up and there is a down but it's not way off in the milky way somewhere although the heavens and heavens of heavens expand throughout the universe and they can't even find the borders and they really believe it's even ever expanding right now see and so we find that there's there's a number of references in the scripture because jesus descended into the lower parts of the earth brother branham descended down you remember the way he described it i was falling and there was no foundation it was a weary misery because there was no foundation no firmness he could stand on and here come all the spooks around him because he was a newer rival see now he didn't go up he didn't stay here he said i started falling and i've heard other people have near-death experience described the same things and so we find that that the bible says pharaoh that pharaoh descended at his death they thought he was going into the into heaven but not according to the bible according to the bible he descended down into the pit and all along the pit are cells and there's millions upon millions of people in those cells and they watched pharaoh and they and the convicts shouted from their cells oh pharaoh you too now you've come down here to join us you were a heathen well guess what you were wrong about heaven and now pharaoh you're descending down into the pit the bible tells us in revelation 12 that satan fell from heaven that a star fell from heaven which was satan because he was given the keys to the bottomless pit see and so we realized that that that brother here's another here's another thing a prophet would say the lid is torn off hell and demon powers are streaming into the earth have i expanded your mind you you're fully expanded today you understand you're not just living in light time and matter behind in in realms you can't see i'm gonna tell you something friends and and when the enemy one of the things that became so real to me when the lord saved my life and i didn't know that i was perhaps hours or at most days from dying and when i realized that god and i and i said to somebody the enemy was moving and devils were conspiring to take me out but what i couldn't see in a realm i couldn't see angels were moving to interdict angels were moving every time a devil would move an angel would cut him off and i can go back in my memory and remember it happening i go that's why wow that's why that happened that was the enemy trying to kill me but god saw me standing here saw us together hallelujah and there was no way god could let that happen it's like i said to you last wednesday there's no child of god left this earth unless their time was up or god for some sovereign reason allowed it in his own in his own choosing so we just say blessed that's why paul could say in all things i've learned no matter what condition i'm content because i'm in the hands of the lord see and so we find that the lid is torn off jacob saw angels he come to bethel and bethel was was completely uncommon there was nothing bethel was just common land but what made it what made that spot a holy spot was jacob laid laid his head on a pillow and when he when he woke up there was a ladder that was standing on the earth and connected to heaven and he saw angels going up and down that ladder coming from heaven to here from here to heaven from heaven to here from here to heaven and he stood there and watched them and then he said at the top of the ladder now he sees the son of man and the son of man is making a pledge to him and jacob is making a pledge back to him and i'm going to tell you something that ground jacob come out of it and said my goodness i didn't even realize that this is nothing less than the house of god and this is the gate of heaven see i mean god chose told moses very particularly i'm getting ahead of myself but he told moses at the burning bush now you're going to go and you're going to free the people and you're going to bring them back to this mountain and it's going to be there that i'm going to speak to him and that was even before the exodus and now now moses has a commission and when he brings them back then the mountain which was just a mountain like any other mountain but now god came down on the mountain and a mountain that anybody was welcome to traverse 24 hours prior anybody tries it now dies if even an innocent animal put a hoof on it had to be killed because now the mountain became consecrated even though it was just an ordinary mountain you're just an ordinary person it's not the man that comes predestinated but there's a seed inside you there's a gene and that means you have an extraordinary purpose you're an ordinary person with an extraordinary purpose of god and when god comes down to tabernacle and his bride then you you yourself become a living temple of the living god and that's when evil spirits are afraid of you that's when you have power with god because like abraham you keep yourself consecrated all the time i'm going to say more about that in a future sermon but i don't want to go too far today so they talk about now here's i'm unqualified to speak about this i'm not a scientist but i got an i got enough hints and clues from a prophet but i know a little bit about it that brother branham said when they look through those telescopes and they see all those millions of light years he said they're actually looking at a curve now we don't fully know what that means and we don't even know exactly what the application is but i do know brother brandon mentions einstein with some of the things he proved one of the things he proved so so so you you understand if you're looking through a curve then it means light is being bent it's a curve it's being bent and science knows the only thing that can bend light is a large body that has a gravitational pull and as light goes around it it'll bend it and and scientists in in the early 20th century knew einstein said that in his paper but they had to wait for a solar eclipse to prove it and they did 1915. i forget the sir something in england he he waited for the solar eclipse and he mapped where the stars were took a photo and then during the eclipse the thing about an eclipse is it illuminates all the stars and when he took the eclipse he took another photo of where the stars were and when he compared the stars had moved they were in a different spot so where they thought they were now they're thinking it's somewhere else now brother branham said we're not seeing it correctly they're looking through it's already bent and so it's it's looking through a curve and and and i was just catching up this morning on the science of it a little bit and and they were saying that the sun is is really the one thing big enough that's why they had to wait on an eclipse of the sun because it bent the light just a little bit but they said one of the things that bends light much more than the sun because it is fantastically larger by many times to the power of something is what they call a black hole and they don't know what it is said well we can we can how do you how do you know it's there because they can see that whatever's there has no light emitting from it it's a whole space that's much more massive that could swallow the thus our sun and not even burp and they don't know what a black hole is but no light can can come out of it see in order to see something light has to go and come back and that's how your your eyes work you're seeing you're seeing photons of light and it's reflecting your brain your brain calculates what you're seeing and that's how you have sight and so now brother branham is saying they're looking at a curve and now i and i just was listening to the scientist today he said really the only thing that can bend light significantly is a black hole and i'm just thinking goodness is a black hole the realm where heaven is that nobody can see say well brother jason you're really getting hooky now i i'm not trying to i'm just broadening your mind i'm just trying to expand you a little bit to say we got all this figured out and life is a lot larger than you come here thinking today say what's the value in this it's just a science lesson no it's not i'm trying to get you to understand that life is more than a job and an education and a career in a recreation and friends and social media your life is more than that you're an eternal creature having a natural experience you came from god you're going back to god and there's a world coming that's makes this one as nothing and so i challenge you today oh understand that you're you're here for a much grander purpose than just the functions of living there'll be a day when this life will just be a faded memory where you worry about so many things here don't you i do don't you we worry about so many things brother brown said well these days you'll get on the other side you'll sit down under a tree and you'll just laugh at that you'll just laugh i was so worried about that it didn't even mean that so now so now we're i mean we already know what science can't prove or disprove but the bible says it we're in the space-time continuum a year is a year a day is a day but in the bible a day in that realm of heaven is a thousand earth years and brother branham goes back to einstein again and says einstein proved that if you could leave and travel the speed of light you might be gone hundreds of years and when you come back you've only been gone a few years and everybody else aged and got all around you and you come back out and you're still young and einstein proved that and he did prove that that's that's science knows he did prove that see and and so so we find that we are sitting together in heavenly places okay you tell me you tell me i'm gonna i'm i'm coming to a climax here because i can't finish today but i want to hit a climax if this all just sounds loopy okay well then then you tell me where did brother branham go when he's standing on a platform and he's here in front of an audience and he's saying if the audience can still hear my voice and the audience is sitting out there look at him yeah of course we can hear your voice and he says and he goes to the woman he says now i see you you're in a doctor's office he said he's a little fat man with big old thick coke bottle glasses yes that's right you can hear her yes that's right and he says he says you've got to uh do do do do and she says do edema he goes yeah he said i heard him say that yeah that's what he said now where'd he go first of all that's already happened in the past so where does a prophet go what is your past is the past is space time continuum just what we thought it is or is it something more than that here's a prophet who can stand here present and walk into the future and look back and go now when you get to hear this will be happening and you know what happens then he comes back and now he's back here and then you because you're stuck in the channel you go walking and by the time you get to here there it is exactly just what he said here it is so what's the future so then what's the timeline what's life anyway all right i'm just broadening your mind because i'm coming back to this statement again see what does it mean to sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus now watch i'm gonna just take a few more minutes so brother branham says in the seventh seal he says now i'm sure he says something's been going on all week and what it was was those angels moving in and out and a setting of prophecy and history was taking place and all it was was 500 people on a little little bitty church on penn street in indiana and while that's happening the whole world is going about their business and politics and governments and the kremlin and the vatican and the white and the white house and schools and universities and people and vacations everything everything's going on and here's god on a little bitty building and seven angels are visiting a prophet to give the greatest unlocking of mystery the world has ever known and he says now i've i've been i'm wondering if anyone would catch it he said no you didn't catch it he said but he said now he go he's going to give a little clue he says i'm sure you noticed you've noticed the things that's been happening this week i'm sure you noticed the little collins boy laying there now i know this collins boy is michael right mom it was michael collins and he says laying there dying the other night and they told him he can't go to school he's going to lay in a bed he could expire any time and within i think a day or two no the next day he went to school and it was so alarmed the community the doctors rushed in this child is going to be dead and they examined him we can't find a trace of it it didn't have to go through divine healing that takes sometimes days and months and even years it just one minute he's dying can't move the next minute he's in school and fine he says i guess you noticed the little leukemia girl the other night and all of these things that were happening by the power of the spoken word now watch and brother branham says here's what he says it is you want to know what it is the kingdom of god is coming and it's now watch not its way off in the misty blue someday it's going to get here no and it's becoming more from the negative to the positive as it has been what was happening there in that little church with five or six hundred people in 1963 an insignificant group thought to be cults the brother branham's ministry has already been rejected by the world he went from from meetings where they had a hundred thousand to fifty thousand to twenty thousand to five thousand to five hundred and this one is the greatest meetings he's ever held went into cities where every single human being in the hospital left healed held meetings where he stood in a pulpit for eight nights and everybody that came to the platform was healed miraculously and now here he is saying that's nothing compared to this what was the what was chapter 10 all about what was the opening of those seals about what was happening now that now a kingdom of god is coming it's becoming more from the negative to the positive as it has been he says now that ought to choke people it went from justification sanctification baptism the holy ghost and then here see we're just drawing closer to god all the time see and so heavens have come down you get that heavens have come down what happened in chapter 10 of revelation heavens come down brother branham back in the in the revelation of jesus christ series when he's referring to the silence in heaven he said god emptied heaven now i don't fully know what that means i don't fully know what that means there's some people who preach different things that you know all the believers are already here in another dimension and i don't know i don't know about all that it's uh we'll figure it out when it happens we'll know you understand brother brown says once it starts see and i'm looking for it to start hallelujah oh i'm telling you something friends we're going to wake up one of these mornings and we're going to start to hear a little report of this and someone's been seen they were dead for years and someone saw and another report's going to come in yes it's happening here and over here and over here i'm here to tell you one of these days we're going to walk right through those doors and say we're done we're done we're finished it's time to go hallelujah that is a reality of our lives the kingdom is not coming it's already started with the opening of the word god has come down to tabernacle the living god in living people see we meet him in the atmosphere he doesn't step foot on the earth we meet him in the atmosphere after a month or so of getting to know because you're going to need a month or so people say 30 to 40 days brother didn't say it that way he caught it a month or so because that was 40 days that they that abraham and sarah and then wandered around after the resurrection and so brother brown said after a month or so why are we going to need that because because when brother branham went beyond the curtain of time he didn't see paul he didn't see luther he didn't see all of those he saw his people so we find that under the throne there's all kinds of places where god has people tucked away but on that glorious morning they're all coming back and i'm here to tell you it's going to take a month or so because we're going to wonder i wonder if so-and-so made it i wonder if so-and-so made it and we're going to be oh what an hour friends what a time that's going to be and we're going to need that time because when we see him in the atmospheres oh we need to have all of our questions answered and all of our focus is on him say brother jason this is kooky crazy preaching you people are nuts well brother branham said i'm happy this way if this ain't that then i'll take this till that comes uh uh call me a nut but i'm i'm i'm i'm i'm threaded to the right boat that's for sure i'll be a nut for jesus who's not were you going to be a nut for science who doesn't understand any of this stuff and disbelieves all of it but i'm here to tell you we had a prophet that came and proved it heaven he said what's the cause of the of the evil in the world would you believe that it's god doing it yeah indirectly there's no evil in god but what's happening is it's the presence of the morning star pressing the darkness see that's what the science knows it's the darkest right before the sun comes up because as the sun is coming those photons in light are congealing the darkness and that's why the world is in such a darkened state because a mighty angel descended in revelation 10 with an open book and a prophet was standing there to take it and and and now a bride is feeding on it and she's coming to be the living tabernacle of the living god's presence amen and what's doing it the presence of the morning star to announce christ to the world brother branham said it's the morning star that's why it's so dark it's it's the light pressing on the darkness he said in former latter reign 1960 and shalom 64 the hour is upon us darkness gross darkness gross darkness on people that's what it is what does it all mean amen what does it all mean where are we standing what hour are we in how close are we to the coming he says what does it all mean god has began to separate the light from the darkness sea pressing it behind like he did in the beginning to show the dawn of the new day the church ages are fading out this is 1964. god is pressing the darkness into a place it has to do it to fade out the church organizations fade out the world the world is covering the thing over and worldlyism has took the whole thing then isn't god right by worldly things and worldly dressing and worldly acting and worldly living listen listen use that use that my precious young sisters when when you feel like dressing in the vulgar fashions of the world and exposing your body and having lustful men lust after you just remember you're feeding the darkness it's the darkness causing you to do that come to the light today see so he says worldisms took the whole thing it's the world you're not of the world little children you are of heaven this is not your home thank god thank god thank god bethel tabernacle this is not my home now i say to the church shalom god's peace peace every true hebrew when he meets another one shalom other words good morning god be with you god's peace go with you it's a good morning how do you do it's breaking day church it's darkness upon the people but it's good morning to the church christ is appearing among us shalom peace hallelujah shalom when we see darkness settling darkness just before day we know that the morning star is hanging yawned her yonder to introduce the coming sun that's when the morning star shines between sea it's always dark as just a few minutes before day the blackout comes the moon fails to shine the darkest day the darkest before day because the light is pressing the darkness but the morning star comes out and says good morning hallelujah that's him doing it that's him doing it his word the morning star his word being identified shalom the great day is fixing to break and when morning breaks eternal bright and fair when his chosen one shall gather to their home beyond the sky when the roll is caught up yonder i'll be there our names are on his book we'll be there we'll be there shalom good morning peace

building and say oh someday he's coming someday somewhere over a rainbow he's coming when will it ever come will when will he ever come it's already here you're in it right now and all that's happening is you're unfolding as you become more and more and more into his very image when this bride when the last seed is called and this bride understands who she who she really is see who she really is say oh i'm immortal i'm a human i live in south carolina i got a job i got a career no no no who she really is oh you mean i'm something besides me of course you are this is just a shadow a negative existence that indicates a puzzle and brother branham said you see a tree struggling to live he said that proves there's one somewhere don't struggle you see an old person laying on a bed gasping for their last breath he says it proves there's a body waiting that don't do that oh friends i'm so glad i'm so glad i can say to you this morning shalom now brother jason i got this problem

heads just before we sing father we thank you today we thank you today lord i i just i stand here before the people and i just confess i confess before the people lord i want to live higher i want to move higher i want to be more in the light and that means that if i'm more in the light then i'm less in the darkness there's no compromise you can't be both as i move into the light if i'm not in the light then i'm in the darkness i'm one of the other i want to move and live and breathe and operate in the light i want to see my mind and my faith and my obedience and my life and my my habits and my
