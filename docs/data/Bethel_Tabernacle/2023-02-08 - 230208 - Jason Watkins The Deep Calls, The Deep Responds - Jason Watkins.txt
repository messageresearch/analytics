hallelujah we want to turn right to Genesis chapter 2 amen and um got a number of prayer requests are going to bring to the Lord shortly but um let's have a reading we're just going to read one verse and we'll let you be seated I want to speak tonight on a thought that came to me a couple days ago kind of a little bit of an interruption in my series I hope that'll be all right with you amen so I'm not I don't get to choose that amen every Minister knows you don't get to choose it so um amen it even seems a little strange for me on a Wednesday night I said Lord how about I preach that on Sunday nope you've got Sonny's material and so I'm going to be back to my back to my series but I want to take a little diversion tonight Lord drop this on my heart a couple nights ago a couple mornings ago I want to speak on the Deep calls the Deep response Genesis 2 4. these are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens let's pray father we thank you for your word now this evening lord it's just every thought I have Lord for the last couple days and all day today Father I'm just committing myself into your hands there's very likely more material than I can cover so I'll just depend on you to cover what's necessary so I commit it to you commit myself into your hands for service in Jesus name amen God bless you can be seated friends eth is this working it is okay good so let's uh have my PowerPoint up straight away amen so we want to begin straight away and again as you can see how often you see me use a um PowerPoint on a Wednesday night very very rare so the Deep calls the Deep calls the Deep response glad that when you felt a call for God there was a god I can tell you he's just as happy to have you as you are to have him amen praise the Lord Brother by Adam told us that he asked a simple question what's more valuable the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ or that which it purchased that which it purchased that's more valuable can you imagine can you say to yourself that as the purchase of God you are more valuable to him than the blood of his son see all right so the Deep calls the Deep response thank you brother Ken yeah uh okay I'll let it warm up then a little bit amen praise the Lord am I getting seconds amen I foreign it's all good you must be Anointed with the Holy Ghost amen praise the Lord I want to take a subtitle the Lord God and His Divine family now I want to start this evening with a little bit of inspiration that I borrowed from a good friend of mine we were I was on the Bible study the other day the internet daily Bible study that I teach and brother Tim Calhoun was ministering that morning and my goodness he he came on this one thought and I'm going to borrow it just to delay my foundation and jump headlong oh okay brother Ken thank you amen praise the Lord um so we want to point a couple of things out and and as we read in our opening text Genesis 2 4 you're going to see this term Lord God now it's an important term because this is the first time you're going to see it used uh and and it's and it's and and and in its usage I'm going to Endeavor to show you and demonstrate in the scriptures tonight that that as God unfolded and continued to unfold from Genesis 1 1. in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth and it doesn't say Lord God it just says God and in fact is you can go all through the entire first chapter of Genesis and you won't find this term Lord God until you get to chapter two because this is its first time after the advancement of the word brought creation to ex to its next transition and by that I mean that we find that God created everything and and he and the Bible would say the evening in the morning and the evening in the morning and God looked upon it and it was good and God said and God said and God said and then God looked upon it and it was good and he kept going he kept going he kept going he wasn't finished on day three he wasn't finished on day five day six he comes to day seven and he and we find that yet Adam and Eve are still not even put in human flesh yet and so he's using this term Elohim God but we find that that now coming into Genesis 2 in in verse 4 you're going to find that he's going to start setting the stage up now by the time he gets down to verse 7 I believe it is you're going to find that he's he's starting to make the next move he's starting to make the next transition so he needs a a further understanding of who he is see because now he's not just a self-existing one now he's God dwelling with his family you can see that in the Bible you find uh you know that God said to Moses concerning uh his name Jehovah he says I was not known by that name you know in Abraham's day now that's strange to us because Abraham used the term Jehovah Jireh but what he's simply meaning is now that you have to understand that that that Jehovah is really a great term to understand it's God dwelling with his family and so in Abraham he gives him a promise that you're going to have a family it'll be my family it'll be a Christ seed line and I'm gonna I'm gonna need a name that's going to reflect that and every time God made a move he he took a name to describe him more carefully so whether it was Jehovah Jireh whether it was Jehovah Shalom or whether it was Jehovah Nissi whatever you find all of these various names God was indicating I've I've Advanced and I I want I've unfolded them a little more and I want you to understand there's a there's a further characteristic of me and we need to name it and so this is why that Jesus represented all of the compound Redemptive names of Jehovah they were found in the Lord Jesus Christ so we find then that you can see here verse 5 and every plant of the field before it was in the earth and every herb of the field before it grew for the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the Earth and there was not a man to till the soil so catch that there's not yet a man to till the soil all right and so he says here um let me catch up to myself all right and so then he comes he moves on and the Lord God formed Man Out of the Dust of the ground and breathed now this isn't this isn't just him the Bible saying God did this it's saying the Lord God did this because there's now going to be an opportunity for a further Fellowship that Adam is not just in spirit form but now he's an expression he's Faith he's become manifest now he's more what God was looking for he's further along and now God is going to be able to have a fellowship I I expressed Sons out of my genes but I couldn't Fellowship them when they were within me but after they're expressed through the betting ground of a mother then now I can embrace them and talk to them and counsel with them and and and get advice from them and vice versa and and so this was always God's plan he wanted a kingdom he wanted a family and we're it now watch I've got to make sure you're catching that verse and then goes to 2 8. and the Lord God planted a garden see he's continuing now he's moving he's on the move and the Lord God planted a garden Eastward in Eden and there he put the man whom he formed 2 9 and out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is Pleasant to the sight good for food the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil verse 15 and the Lord God took man and put him into the Garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it now I I want to just I want to I want to give you some some renderings from Strong's Concordance on this on this term Lord God all right so it's this is where you're going to it's not going to be just Elohim he's going to identify himself a little more closely and he's going to take a name you'd be familiar with Yahweh they didn't even pronounce it to the to the Renaissance and then they tried to put it together in the early days they didn't pronounce the name of God just out of respect to him but uh but we find that that that the name Yahweh then they then they later on translators put in the word done because they're trying to get a word that has no vowels it's all consonants and they're trying to make it into a word so that so that we can get a grasp of it it's all translation work as they were making the Bible but we find that when Elohim met him in the in the in the tent there in the Book of Genesis and he's coming to confirm the Covenant Abraham uses the exact word that in every case in the Bible and there's not even a single time it's not that the name he chose to call him was the exact name it only had one meaning and that is God the god the Creator the everything and so there was no mistake in Abraham's mind who he was talking to though he was talking to a human he's talking to a human man built out of the Dust of the ground but he refers to him with a name that is only attributed to the creator of all heavens and earth so now when we get this term Lord God it's a noun of course meaning God but it refers to more to his proper name of the god of Israel particularly how uh you know how he revealed himself to Moses in Exodus 6 and so some other indications is that its primary meaning should be understood in the context of God's existence namely that he is the I am that I am you remember Moses said who will I say sent me so now the people are going to want to know he can't just say uh you know Elohim sent me well what does that even mean see because now he's going to have to be a little more specific he's actually going to say the I Am Oh you mean the personal one the one Abraham met yeah that one that one sent me see this isn't some vague idea of just a creator of heavens and earth this is actually a an identification a name identifies and so so it also goes on to mean it has a frequent appearance in the name in relation to God's Redemptive work so you know and then sometimes in a car it's compounded with other words to describe the character of the Lord in Greater detail you find that in Genesis 22 Exodus 17 judges 6 various places now what I'm trying to aim at and get you I'm not trying to make a Hebrew scholar out of you I'm trying to get you to understand that that this whole idea of going from just God to Lord God is describing a relationship of Fellowship a knowing of this God very deeply so it's a greater knowing it's a it's a further unfolding of God you know it's just like you know I married my wife 40 whatever years ago and you know my love for her today is far greater than the day I stood in an altar and said I do I can't even describe to you how much how deep how it's deepened and and and and and and you realize a lot of times you know when you have something and that's why when it's not real love then people get tired of each other because it's not new anymore but when it's a real Eternal mate it the longer it goes the deeper it gets the deeper it gets the more committed you are see and so this whole idea of going from God to Lord God is is a is it it's referring to an involvement with this God it's it's describing a caring for this God a caring for his word and and it comes from a a very deep place in your heart Jesus said in Matthew 22 that Jesus said unto him Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind this is the first and great commandment so so when we're when we're reading this you're seeing God now coming into a deeper relationship with his creation because now they've moved from Spirit man to flesh man and now God has someone to tend the garden he created this beautiful garden now he's got somebody to manage it see and so and so we find that that this is so important for you to understand so so let's carry on and the Lord God took the man and put him in him into the Garden of Eden to do what to dress it and to keep it we dropped down to 16. and the Lord God commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat Verse 18 and the Lord God said it is not good that man should be alone I will make him a helmet for him you go on down to 19. all right and out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field and every fowl of the air and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them now this is this is quite a transfer of confidence you know God's got a lot of confidence in the sun to only name him what God would name him there's obviously a great confidence that God has that he has the level of fellowship with Adam and it's so pure it's so deep there's such a closeness there that it's that it's you you can see it right but brother M talks about the apostles in the in the early church that they were so in tune with the holy spirit that God didn't even have to always speak just nod his head in a way they would go how I would like to say Lord God let that be me let it let me because that's the kingdom restoration we're coming back you're coming back to this kind of com this kind of communion see then I could say to you you should never ever allow yourself to not be moving toward that I can say to you that Satan's design and his desire is to cut that advancement off he will use whatever means necessary now his means are quite limited because he a demon is almost powerless unless he can get someone to work through so I would say to you don't open your mind to him don't open your heart to him don't open your home to him don't cut him off at every pass eliminate him out of your life eliminate him out of your relationships eliminate him out of your friendships you know eliminate the devil out of your Recreation eliminate the devil out of your career eliminate the devil out here out of your Pursuits and then you'll stand Victorious and strong in the power of His might see verse 21. and the Lord caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept he took one of his ribs closed up the flesh instead thereof verse 22. and the rib which the Lord God had taken from man made he a woman see further Advanced now he's doing to Adam what he has done to himself he's taking something from within Adam and expressing it he's not he's not taking a a different creation that's the beauty of Eve being a byproduct of Adam a byproduct people think sometimes it's always in a negative connotation and that's not even that's not even that's almost actually never true that there are many byproducts that we live today and have wonderful inventions because they took this this thing and this thing and there was a reaction and It produced a byproduct you understand and so all kinds of different compounds and and by themselves they wouldn't really help you they might even kill you but put them together they produce a byproduct and save your life see so so God is now not wanting he didn't want to have a family separate from himself when he made his family because then if if anything had a beginning then it has to have an end that way like hell was created it had a beginning it has an end he doesn't want to do that he wanted to express the bride so that she would be just as Eternal as him and he would never lose her see so so we find that he's taking her out of Adam she's a further expression of him so the rib verse 22 again and the rib which the Lord God had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man look at now watch Genesis 3 1. now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made and he said unto the woman yea hath God said what happened to Lord God so now you're seeing an intentional reduction this is his this is his approach to Eve what's he trying to do get her to agree with him that what God Said shouldn't mean as much as you think it should so it's all about a reduction God sent his word and Satan wants to come in right away and reduce your dependency on it reduce your faith in it and reduce your alliance with it yea hath God said you should not eat of every tree of the garden see now watch watch how this conversation goes look how fast Eve collapses and the woman said unto the serpent we made of the fruit of the Trees of the garden but of the I'm sorry but of the fruit of the trees which is in the midst of the garden now she's quoting him he's already got her he's already got her it's just a matter of time because he's been successful in reducing her faith in what God had already moved forward to be and it's almost like what God is now on The Cutting Edge where God is now in this position she is starting Satan is trying to get her don't believe that see so now it's just hath hath God said and now she's quoting it back God hath said You shall not even neither shall you touch it so so when we when we look at that you can take it down Heath when we begin to look at this whole idea of a reduction in the relationship and and how easily Satan suggested to her you need to kind of relax a little bit on just how much you take God's word for things there needs to be a little bit of a reduction and and what is so astonishing to me as I was thinking about this I thought how that the that the Lord God from Genesis 2 and 4 that the Lord God did so many good things in the previous 11 instances and I read you enough verses to cover 11 times where he says the Lord God from Genesis 4 down to where we come into chapter three and God had did so many good things in the previous instances the Lord God that how that he had literally cooed to Nature and brother Brown talks about how that that pillar fire moved over the Earth and it began to coo and make love and and and and and and birds flew up out of the dust and the and the father said oh that's beautiful keep going keep going don't go backwards don't stop keep going the more you go the more Beauty the further you go the more that'll make sense though whatever you do don't stop and it kept going and the grass and the trees and the animals and the whales and and suddenly the whole world is teeming and here God had created such a paradise giving his word out so freely that that was there and it was only only exclusively resulting in Adam's richness there wasn't one negative thing that happened to Adam believing the word not one negative thing it was all about blessing and all about life in fact is it was so good it built something we haven't had since a perfect world and as soon as there was a reduction then there was an immediate then that was an immediate Interruption and death came sweeping in why when God did it when the Lord when God built and then the Lord God began to carry on everything just kept going life more life more life higher life higher life better life higher life more life better life Beauty more Beauty much more Beauty much much much more Beauty the whole thing is becoming from glory to glory from glory to glory until there somebody believed in a reduction and somebody halted on their faith and said wait a minute I'm not so sure and immediately death was in the camp and immediately the whole world fell into sin when you I can tell your friends that once God even the real one who has a real anointing that he can pour upon your life and when and when that very real God with that very real anointing suffers a reduction in your mind and you go you begin to grow distant from him which is inevitable you certainly will then right away you'll begin to accept a watered-down word a watered-down fellowship a watered-down experience he will no longer be Lord God to you will still know him as God but Lord means lordship Lord this word Lord entails relationship that you'll be born of his bone and word of his word and life of his life and love of his love and what and that's why David was the was the apple of his eye because God was simply saying David the way he was a man I'm sorry the meaning of the scripture a man after God's Own Heart what that's meaning in the Hebrew is God is saying that David how God thought about things David thought he's a man after my heart my heart's like his heart his heart's like my heart we think alike we we feel alike we love alike oh I want to be a man after God's Own Heart see but when he's no longer the Lord got to you and I want to say to you today how can you expect anything but chaos to follow you it's it's inescapable the same way you'd think something as beautiful as Eden nothing could over overthrow it but it did the family of God overthrew all that beauty in a day when we talk about the Deep calling to the Deep oh that in Jeremiah 7 how that he would call to her he would call to Israel he would tell His prophets come on to her and there's not numerous places I could have went to tonight I just picked one verse in Jeremiah 7 27 therefore Thou shalt speak all these words unto them but they will not hearken unto thee Thou shalt also call unto them but they will not answer thee now you remember the story brother around tell us about how that eagle got blown down and he was hunting and that little chatter chatter chipmunk over there and and brother Branham you know and he's all this nature he loved nature and he he said he stepped out there you know and the finally when it quit raining and the storm had blown that eagle down and the little policeman of the woods was like you know giving him the what for you know what are you doing here you're not supposed to be here you're you're supposed to be up in the heavens I'm here to tell you if if critics will run me into the heavens I just say criticize on because I need to be up in the heavens I don't need to let storms keep me on the ground I just need to sorrow up into the heavens if trials and tribulations are What It Takes and the enemy comes after me with 1000 tribulations and my heavenly father allows it but that'll cause me to leap and flop and catch a stream and head back into the heavens and I just say Lord by whatever means necessary and brother Madison I stepped out there and the glistening the the the the the the mist and he said and and way over here he heard a lone wolf and he called way in the distance of this Great Wilderness and he said way down here in the valley his mate answered him a deep called and a deep responded why because they were mates and they recognized each other's voice and the storm of Life the storm had separated them that got they got separated because of the Wilderness experience oh my that male wolf as he caused to his mate and she responds and and she would call and he would answer and I'm here to tell you there there shouldn't be any storm of life and there shouldn't be any distance of Separation there shouldn't be any Wilderness experience that you have to go through that cut off the love of God that when the voice of God begins to echo down you say Here I Am Lord over here I am hallelujah or that you have the ability to say master I don't know what's happening I'm in a terrible spot I don't know where I am can you help me and to hear the heavens Echo back I'm right here my son I'm coming stand still and know that I am God I'm here to tell you that's the kind of relationship that an unfettered faith in God's word will produce he calls she answers I thought about in our day how the strong Angel called the strong Angel stood there beside John oh let him come who's worthy to take the book and when a strong he wasn't the mighty Angel he was just a strong Angel and when the strong angel came when the strong Angel cried out a lamb responded from the eternities Hallelujah come forward to take the book oh my you know you if you if you think about how that he says he he took the book and he loosed the seals and he called for his Queen to come and stand by his side do you hear the call do you feel the poor is the seal open to you then the king is calling will you respond and say yes my Lord I will come and Stand By Your Side I will be identified with the word of this day and nothing no trial no Wilderness no storm is going to stop that if I lose sight of you I'll find you if you lose sight of me you'll find me no no where I could go could I ever get away from the love of God in the Song of Solomon beautiful story he calls to her he comes to her door my love he reaches his fingers through the lattice and she and she can see him but she delays and he's calling to her and he's he's looking for a response and he comes to her in the Still of the Night when there there should be no disturbances my love come to the door open the door who is it oh it's your love and look here I'm trying to reach to you I'm trying to reach to you and she delayed and the next thing you know he was gone oh she jumped to her feet she jumped out of her bed I I relate to this woman so many times when I heard him call and I let life pull me aside and I didn't answer and then when I I went to hunt him I couldn't find him and like her I ran into the streets and she ran through the streets have you seen him whom my soul loves and she ran into these people and they had this opinion and they had that opinion and there was people trying to abuse her oh but my friends she wasn't searching for some religious idea she needed more than series from some man-made catechism she was looking for something real and there was a real to seek and there was a real to be had and there was a love to be restored it's not a a disagreeable point to Point into the language of the Hebrew Old Testament and find that the word used to describe God is plural that makes perfect sense to us understanding the godhead doesn't mean a polytheistic ideology of multiple beings but we find that God was plural and and the and as I was saying earlier his whole Kingdom his whole family his whole plan his bride his people everything he would ever have it was an expression coming out of him that's why we were showing in Revelation 21 by the time it's a new heavens and a new Earth everything everything that's uh that's that's even slightly not the original is not there Satan is gone hell is gone the everything's gone the whole world is now renewed everything is God and God is everything he's filling all-time space and Eternity and and and that is going to be an amazing no wonder it said I saw a new heavens and a new Earth and so we find that being plural in Genesis a deep could call but that deep would always if you see the pattern and this is one of the most astounding sermons to me it's the one I always had to denominational preachers is the spoken word is the Original Seed because that is an immovable landmark in the economy of God he never changes his mind about his word and if you want to know do you have his word you there is only one test to perform is it according to his original word because as far as God is concerned his word doesn't change so if your teaching doesn't line up to every word you've got the wrong teaching so I'm so glad my whole life since a child starts sitting in the woods as a teenager with my Bible and knowing this God I was beginning to know him traveling the world to preach this message on six continents I've never found anywhere that it wasn't according to his word and I've never found any time where God wouldn't come on the scene and prove it with infallible Divine Miracles and move on the scene to prove it and I know what it's done in my heart I know how it's changed my life friends and I don't plan to have a reduction in my relationship I'm not going to let Leo to see it do that to me I'm not going to let the world come between me and him have you seen my lover have you seen the one whom my soul loves say yes brother Jason he's sitting right beside me oh thank you yes you're right I see him and I see him and I see him and I see him Hallelujah I'm so happy he he comes here and he we find that the principle of the spoken word is original see the principle of the seed is that God is going to be able to put into motion a deep call and a deep response within himself you say that's strange how can that that doesn't even sound that sounds how does that even work well you know something friends I I have something inside of me and and when something calls something inside me that's more than me responds there's something down inside of me some piece of him that Amen to the word that just Wells up and says amen amen even and my faith goes so much further thank God it goes further than my understanding because I wouldn't be possible if I didn't know him and the power of his resurrection but I know whom I have believed and I know what he's capable of in our lives and so he's he's got a deep that he's calling and why does he why does he bring forth creation because there's a deep responding oh I want to know you yes Father I want to know you oh I want to know you my pride yes we want to know you I want a kingdom yes we want to be a part of that Kingdom I want to have a world yes we want to be a part of that world and we're still saying it today I said my word yes I believe your word I got a plan of redness and yes Count Me In don't be a part of the world no no never I don't want to be a part of the world there's a deep calling and a deep that responds because you would only call for the same kind because the seed brings forth of its kind so the word's only ever going to call for the word it's exactly why the world refuses it because it's not a world call it's a word call see and so you know Adam longed for this kind you know God from eternity's longed for this kind God said he looks on Adam I showed you the scripture and Adam was lonely and God said you know it's not good that he's alone God's expressing there's such a communion here Adam's got the same kind of a feeling he's got it's not good how does God know because God knows it's not good to be alone at one time he had been alone with his thoughts and and then and then God created the heavens and the earth oh but friends you know there was still his family wasn't in manifestation and so he keeps working and keeps working and keeps working until what he has a son and his son's wife and now he can Fellowship them and that's exactly why when they fell in sin and brother Branham said that God would not see he saw his creation he said he would not see it lay there face down in ruin he will not be defeated he's God and he will not be defeated and he began immediately oh let me take some Redemption don't need any amount of time Redemption starts immediately rebuilding it back that's what I want I don't want I don't want to wait till next week I want to say tonight Lord God renew revive rebuild see so we find that Adam longed for this kind God from the eternities longed for this kind I'm so happy to raise my hand say Lord I long for that let me raise my hand in this Dark World say Lord I long I'm I'll raise them both Lord I long for that kind of relationship I long for like seed like life like Faith a like existence so we find that that of like seed would respond to his word and flatly his word only that's why Prophet would say she has the word and the word only she won't accept any other seed it takes the word of God it's the only only the only seed she is open to you see now Satan come as we read and immediately starts trying to bring a reduction he's successful next thing you know Eve's quoting him and so we find that that that it that that God it was never going to let that stand he was never going to let that stand and in fact is it won't even take him very long to set the record straight Genesis 3 8 Ethan and they heard now this is the very next what look at this here he comes it's only been a few verses Satan's been oh hath God said well uh God said that we shouldn't do this and God now now look who shows up Genesis 3 8 and they heard the voice of who the Lord God Walking In The Garden in the cool of the day and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the amongst the Trees of the garden so he's he's going to call them out of their hiding place and he's going to have a hearing he's going to render a judgment there's been a breach in the faith there's been a breach in the law somebody has violated the word and God is there not God the Lord God he's going to set the record straight I see how this happened there was a reduction in belief in me so I've come now to set the record straight and he's going to call them from their hiding place and he's going to judge the matter with his Justice because he's the Lord God over Justice do you believe that he's the Lord God over judgment he's the Lord God of right thinking let the Heathen rage all they want to let the critics rage all they want to but by the time you get to the 14th verse Satan and the serpent is going to learn a very painful lesson he's going to learn a hard lesson he's going to learn that the Lord God is the god over the enemy he's the Lord God over Justice he's the Lord God over Mercy he's the Lord God over judgment you can rely on him he's the Lord God over the enemy Hallelujah do you believe he's the Lord God over the enemy when you go down to verse 21 he's also the Lord God over Redemption to make bloody skins he's the only one who can do it let me hear I'm here to tell your friends he he rules and Reigns over Justice and judgment and mercy and faith and his word he rules over the enemy and he is the authority over Redemption and nobody can offer you Redemption only Christ in his word can offer you Redemption no man-made Theory can do it no amount of Good Deeds no social club it's going to take the lamb who grabbed the book and loose the seals and brought Redemption the Lord God he's not going to tolerate this reduction in his person he's not going to allow even the world goes off admired by the time you get to Genesis 6. you find that sons of Adam and Sons of Seth have married into Daughters of Canaan intermingle the whole human race and sin is rampant all over the world that that thing that was a beautiful garden that God made perfect but somebody reduced it and now the whole world is covered in sin and there's just a very few righteous people one Enoch who is taken it was not he's he he's a he's an original astronaut he was not you know astronauts and cosmonauts man those guys are lame they have to get on a rocket ship and hope it don't blow up was not just get taken see and so I told somebody the other day God is the ultimate body Snatcher one of these mornings is coming for me hallelujah oh I'll be gone in a moment in the twinkling of an eye say where'd he go he vanished what does that even mean he's gone that's all we know Hallelujah but by the time you come to Genesis 9 now you're going to see how that God is is again he's not going to let that stand so that by the time you get to Genesis 9 the Lord God decided the Lord God decided that Shem would be blessed now sham is the progenitor he's the ancestor of Abraham prior to Abraham Abraham come directly from the line of Shem so so so God the Lord God in in in making this decision the Lord God said his Blessing would be upon Shem and Canaan would serve him and all of these various things but we find that that that he's restoring the Christ seed line After the flood and he's putting it back in the Earth are you realizing friends are you realizing tonight why Satan's charges against you in the Supreme Court of Heaven won't stand have you ever stopped to realize it's not cause you smell good or look fine or you're a nice person uh we were all most of us rotten to the core but this is a seed Light of Christ and it's it's in the court of Heaven is unchargeable unindictable and God will not receive a charge against his family Zechariah 3 proves that based strictly on Election on nothing another Merit election alone Satan with every DNA evidence and video replay high definition satellite imagery had Israel dead to rights they were absolutely guilty and Satan had the evidence until he didn't because God threw every bit of it out on one basis alone this is Jerusalem whom I have chosen now get out of my court and don't you ever bring charges against my family again Hallelujah friends that this is like Faith this is like seed this is like word Hallelujah so the Lord God has declared that we stand before the highest court in creation you stand innocent the Lord God who is the god over judgment has pronounced you innocent not just not guilty because there wasn't enough evidence to convict you so since we're not sure we're gonna have to let you go God is very sure you're innocent God is very sure you never did it in the first place God is very sure over who you are sometimes we doubt who we are but God has never been in say how did he find me uh he called and something responded I was lost in the world it didn't matter no storm no Wilderness could cut you off he called down into the valley and something within me said Here I Am Lord here I am give me that word oh my Genesis 15. after these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in the vision saying fear not Abram I am thy Shield and thy exceeding great reward see now Genesis uh 15 uh one to four eighth so how did Abraham get here how did how did he ever find himself being talked to by God because God blessed his ancestor and said in Shem I will bless the seed line of Shem After the flood after I destroyed it all I took my only redeemable son home and I carried Noah and his family through the flood which was a type of the foolish virgin I'm sorry that's it's actually more of a type of the 144 000 there's one quote where he talks about it being the foolish virgin because it's a dual type but it's most largely in reference to the 144 000 who are redeemed not just spared they're redeemed they they when the bride goes up we find the bride leaves the Earth the eagle anointing doesn't leave the ego anointing lifts up flies East picks up Moses and Elijah and takes the same gospel to the 144 000. they receive the same message the same word the same Christ the same token the same abstract and they're found on the mountain with the song of Moses rejoicing see he says now he goes on here oh I'm running out of time so fast so he says verse 2. and Abram said Lord God Lord God What wilt thou give me seeing I go childless and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus and Abram said behold to me thou has given no seed and low one born in my house is mine heir but God's not going to let that stand not the Lord God the Lord God's been working on this plan for a long time and he's not going to let some trivial thing in Abraham's condition of Life stop the word of God you're not going to stop God's plan for you I'm going to say it plain you're not going to be able to throw yourself out of God's plan Hallelujah and here's Abram oh now I you you gave you promised me a son you you said you'd be my shield and my exceeding great reward and as soon as God said that you know Abram is just a human just like us can you imagine that God come down to you and said Hey listen I'm going to be your Shield God if if if if God literally spoke to you in an old voices and said I don't want you to worry about anything I'm going to be your shield and your exceeding reward and you said yeah but I got this problem and I don't know how I'm going to fix it and I just can't you know I've tried and tried and tried and Abram said Lord God what will thou give me seeing I go childless God already promised him saying that I go childless in the steward of my houses or Damascus the neighbor and said behold to me thou has given no seed and lo one born in my house is mine Heir but watch how and behold the word of the Lord came to him saying this shall not be thine air but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine Heir I know you're in a body of Flesh and it's fallen and you've got problems and you've got weaknesses but I'm here to tell you that sin born in your house that's not going to be your Heir what's going to be my ear there's a gene down on the inside and it's going to produce a new body and that's going to be your hair your air you're going to be an air of eternal life your your Fallen conduction isn't going to stop that stop doubting it Abraham I'm your shield and your exceeding reward I won't even entertain an accusation against you I won't stop till I get you home Hallelujah if you think about Ezekiel he gives a beautiful I don't have time tonight I'm already out of time but Ezekiel breaks down the ministry in the priesthood in Prophecy and he goes talking about a certain family line and you're going to have priests and Levites who are working at various stations in the ministry on behalf of Israel all throughout the the temple and you're going to have them around the outside you're going to have them around the inside everybody's going to have a job they're going to be moving around you're going to come in and there's going to be somebody at the Brazen altar there's going to be somebody to wash your sacrifice and there's and then you're gonna and then there's an inner cord and there you've got a table of shoe bread and you've got ministers who who are working in there to keep those seven candles burning and keep those lamps trimmed and keep the oil filled up foreign but Ezekiel begins to talk about these priesthood and they have all of this ability to minister to the people concerning the things of God but there was one particular group of priests that God said now to them they are going to be the line that I anoint that will tell you and and and instruct you between right and wrong and that's exactly what I needed because I didn't just need in this day I didn't just need a minister who could tell me Jesus loves me this I know for the Bible tells me so I needed somebody who could yeah that you know Jesus died to sex Sinners thank you oh he loves the world Jesus loves thank you thank you that's all true I love it but in a world that's upside down who's going to tell me what's right and wrong I can't have a priesthood who can just introduce me I gotta have a an anointing I gotta have a seed line that can say this is right and this is wrong and there's no doubt about it and God heard that that's what you and I needed today we needed one voice who could Ascend higher and no and sure I appreciate nominal ministers I appreciate anybody who is preaching the gospel but I needed somebody to tell me this is right and this is wrong and because so many of those ministers are siding with the world and they're letting the world come into their churches and they're letting their women dress and do and they're letting their men go and say but I had somebody who could say you're not of this world Hallelujah you see I wanted to stand before him in perfection and in my heart I was crying for something more I'm here to tell you today let me give you a testimony he responded oh Hallelujah he would say why did he respond he wasn't looking for more Angels he wanted more than just mere friends to sit at his table he wanted more I wanted to believe there was more and and not just to have more but I wanted to believe I could be more and I heard from him you can do all things through Christ you can be everything that God has ordained for you to be and that's the Cry Of My Heart Lord I want to be more I want to be more and the Holy Spirit Echoes back to me there's more to be Hallelujah oh my my when you go further friends then you know when you when you think about what God built and called it good and said it's not only good it's very good and the last place not going to put it up on the screen well I might Ethan let's go to Genesis 28 13. this last time in Genesis not in the Bible but in Genesis you're going to see the last time he's going to use this term Lord God Genesis 28 13 he's talking to Jacob Jacob has ran for his life he's a shyster and behold the Lord stood above it and said I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father and the god of Isaac the land where on thou liest to thee will I give it and unto thy seed the last place that we see this term in Genesis he's standing above Jacob in a dream and he says the very ground you're lying on I'm the very Lord God of thy father Abraham I'm the god of Isaac he's going to be the god of Jacob from here on you're not going to see that term Lord God but we're going to find that he's the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob why why why can't he now say Oh you mean there's a reduction no now he's got a seed line to represent the other side of that do you understand now there's a family now he can move and because later he's going to come to Moses and he's going to be Jehovah because he said I wasn't fully known like that back then but now I got a family and I'm going to bring him out of Egypt and I'm going to take him into a Promised Land is he still going to be the Lord God of course is he still going to still going to be God he always was does the bible use the term more of course it does but the point in Genesis the seed chapter he never uses it again in Genesis after this one right here because God had said all he needed to say this Covenant was going to last Jacob all the way through the remainder of his ups and downs his ins and outs his weaknesses and his mistakes his lying and sneaking and conniving and stealing and and cheating and conning and but that covenant's not going to break that word I am the god of thy I'm the Lord God of Abraham my father and I'm going to make a covenant with you the ground you're laying on I'm going to give it to you and your seed line and that last that promise lasted Jacob all the way till he met an angel and wrestled it out and from that hour he was a prince and God had re-established the line the Royal seed line in the Earth forever and he would never have to that model would never have to be changed that model would never have to be changed he would never change this model he what's the model brother Jason he uses a revelation of his word and his word is him he what is a new birth it's a revelation of Jesus Christ to you personally it's the same model Jacob met him personally and that turned him into a prince forever and that same principle is working tonight that same God can meet you right where you stand he's the same God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob he's the same God of Moses he's the same God of Jesus he's the same God of Paul he's the same God of Elijah hey and I'm here to tell you something friends when he descended in this day as a covenant angel with a rainbow over his head that was the same Covenant angel that that Jacob wrestled with in the Book of Genesis because why he's doing the same thing he has descended as a covenant Angel to say I set the order back there I got a seed line I've watched over it it's come up through it came through the Dark Ages it went through the martyrs it went through the stalk it went through the tassel it went through this chunk it came out into the grain I'm not gonna change my word I'm not going to change my model and I'm here to tell you the word he brought just like Jacob the Covenant he gave Jacob lasted all the way to his name change the word you have received will take you all the way to a body change Hallelujah oh can you rejoice on a Wednesday night and say I'll take that word and it'll take me all the way to a potty chain [Applause] you'll never need here to tell you I don't care how many mistakes you make you'll never need another Covenant you'll never need another messenger you'll never need another message you know why because you've got the messenger and the latter rain you've got Christ himself moving among us tonight and the power of his resurrection oh Hallelujah I feel such a surge of faith I think you can believe her anything right now I don't care what your need is why don't you stand to your feet and say Covenant I agree with the Covenant and I claim every Redemptive blessing that God has provided for me Hallelujah he's among his people the messenger of the latter rain listen friends once the latter rain fell and set the crop to lay in the presence of the August presence for maturing say oh don't we need another Revival not if you don't not if you're not if you don't want to I mean if you want to kill the crop once that you get a planting rain so you can plant and then you get a harvest rain and the Harvest rain once that Harvest rain comes now the grain is laying out there in the presence of the sun you don't want another rain because now it gets moving to maturity it's ripening it's becoming golden yeah I'm not looking for another Revival I'm looking for the coming of the Lord hallelujah I'm not chasing an eighth age or an eighth man the only message I'm ever going to need it's going to take me all the way to a body change it's the seed line of the Blessed it's a seed line that started in Genesis and is leaving the world as recorded in Revelation oh do you love him tonight friends oh my let's bow our heads now father oh Father my father God Lord God my God we love you tonight master I love you for this word I love you for what it's doing inside my soul I love you that it's changing me every day

for your kindness I thank you for the ability to say Amen to every word oh I worship you Lord let's raise up our hands to him friends let's just tell him how much how much do you love him how would

that our love from this day can only grow and grow and grow master I'm so glad you don't wait Lord when you see me in trouble I can call unto you and you respond you can call to me and I'll respond back this love affair Lord will never be broken all the days of my life I'll love you forever I love you on that Shore Lord God I'm going to stand there with all of those Saints of old and say you know I I saw it in your life I saw it in the testimony I saw it in what you said I'm going to tell those prophets you wrote it in the words no one knew the secrets of God until the end time and we we had them come out to us and now we see that that God kept it a secret it was a mystery he didn't say anything about it Paul called it that too but he said he hasn't shown it but he has shown it in every verse of the Bible because there can't be any Revelation outside of the Bible there's no Revelation that will stand on the day of judgment that's contrary or outside the word of God I thank you for that Master we love you today Lord we're turning the order of the service to prayer we have a couple of needs father we want to talk to you about there's needs no doubt throughout the audience and
