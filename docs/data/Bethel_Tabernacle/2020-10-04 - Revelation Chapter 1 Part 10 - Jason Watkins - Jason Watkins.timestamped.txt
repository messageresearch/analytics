[3:44] uh
[6:54] praise the lord good morning greetings
[6:56] to you all in the name of the lord
[6:58] we're going to begin this morning back
[7:00] in our series on the book
[7:02] of revelation and we are trying to
[7:05] if by the help of the lord i want to get
[7:08] through
[7:08] chapter one and kind of make a bridge
[7:11] kind of uh
[7:12] hit the breach here that's going to
[7:15] connect
[7:16] the ages before you actually need before
[7:19] we start into the ages
[7:21] i want to make a few connections so
[7:22] we'll begin reading i think last time
[7:25] we stopped at 11. um let's start from
[7:29] there revelation
[7:30] 1 11. i am alpha and
[7:33] omega the first and the last and what
[7:37] thou seest write in a book
[7:39] and send it unto the seven churches
[7:40] which are in asia
[7:42] unto ephesus unto smyrna and to pergamos
[7:45] under thyatira
[7:47] onto sardis and unto philadelphia and
[7:49] unto laodicea
[7:51] and i turned to see the voice that spake
[7:54] with me
[7:55] and being turned i saw seven golden
[7:58] candlesticks
[8:00] and in the midst of the seven
[8:01] candlesticks one like unto the son of
[8:03] man
[8:04] clothed with the garment down to the
[8:06] foot and gird about the paps with a
[8:08] golden girdle
[8:09] his head and his hairs were white like
[8:11] wool as white as snow
[8:13] and his eyes were as a flame of fire and
[8:15] his feet like undefined brass
[8:17] as if they burned in a furnace and his
[8:20] voice says the sound of many waters
[8:22] and he had in his right hand seven stars
[8:25] and out of his mouth when a sharp
[8:27] two-edged sword and his countenance was
[8:29] as the sun
[8:30] shineth in his strength when i and when
[8:33] i
[8:33] saw him i fell at his feet as dead and
[8:36] he laid his right hand upon me
[8:38] saying unto me fear not i am the first
[8:40] and the last i am he that
[8:42] liveth and was dead and behold i am
[8:44] alive forevermore
[8:46] amen and have the keys of death and of
[8:49] hell
[8:49] write the things which thou has seen and
[8:52] the things which are
[8:54] and the things which shall be hereafter
[8:56] the mystery of the seven stars which
[8:58] thou saust in my right hand
[9:00] and the seven golden candlesticks the
[9:03] seven stars are the angels of the seven
[9:05] churches
[9:06] and the seven candlesticks which thou
[9:08] sawest are the seven
[9:10] churches may the lord bless the reading
[9:13] of his word
[9:14] now we when we were ending
[9:17] last time a couple of sundays ago we're
[9:20] just kind of sharing the
[9:22] sunday school class duties uh with
[9:24] brother jason demars
[9:25] and and so and also brother matt'll no
[9:28] doubt be taking part in that as well
[9:30] but we're looking to try to get through
[9:33] the book of revelation as i've explained
[9:35] to you
[9:36] in the uh recently that we're not doing
[9:39] as exhaustive
[9:40] of a search as we will on the podcast
[9:44] i'm doing more in overview so we'll move
[9:46] quite a bit quicker i just want to hit
[9:48] major points we were ending last time
[9:53] on the need to operate in the spirit
[9:56] because the principle
[9:58] that we've discussed for revelation the
[10:00] book of revelation
[10:02] is it is the bride's book of the end
[10:04] time when we find
[10:06] and that's why you'll find paul not
[10:08] quoting from it
[10:09] because when john brings it back paul
[10:11] has already gone home
[10:12] it's not sent to re-establish new
[10:14] teaching
[10:15] or further teaching it's sent to
[10:17] quantify and qualify
[10:20] everything that had been up to that
[10:21] point remember that the book of
[10:24] revelation
[10:25] is the continuation of the ministry of
[10:28] jesus christ
[10:28] only now in his church whereas it had
[10:32] been god moving above israel and then
[10:35] god walking in jesus christ we remember
[10:39] various points to give us clarity on the
[10:42] godhead
[10:43] and it's these points of why many don't
[10:44] understand the godhead
[10:46] and that is because that when we look at
[10:49] and we say the word christ
[10:51] everybody automatically just thinks of
[10:53] jesus of nazareth
[10:54] but we realize that he was
[10:58] his name was jesus long before he was
[11:00] ever born
[11:01] the book of ephesians in the third
[11:03] chapter tells us and teaches us
[11:05] that that jesus is the one who created
[11:08] the world
[11:09] uh and but yet genesis says god did it
[11:12] so we find
[11:13] that john will tell us that there was
[11:15] not anything made
[11:17] that was made outside of jesus christ
[11:19] making it
[11:20] we realize that it's simply god
[11:22] expressing himself
[11:24] so when we begin to look at great
[11:26] servants of god
[11:27] and we consider moses moses was a
[11:31] was jesus christ in a portion and he was
[11:34] christ the anointed word he was not the
[11:37] nazarene
[11:38] he was christ the anointed word that's
[11:41] why
[11:41] a prophet in this day would say
[11:43] referring to jeremiah
[11:44] jeremiah was christ only meaning that he
[11:47] was a portion
[11:48] of the anointed word on display
[11:52] we find that when jesus was born of a
[11:55] woman
[11:56] he was then the fullness of that godhead
[12:00] entirely in a human body he was all the
[12:03] prophets priests and kings he didn't
[12:05] make him a second person
[12:07] it made him the fullness of the original
[12:09] person now made manifest as a kinsmen
[12:12] redeemer
[12:13] but we realize that jesus there was
[12:16] never a plan
[12:17] when they wanted to move him into his
[12:20] king
[12:21] and make him a king and he knew that
[12:23] that couldn't happen at that time
[12:25] because the kingdom would be a kingdom
[12:27] of saints
[12:28] and there's got to be saints born and
[12:31] now the only way that you can be born
[12:33] is you are a saint means a sanctified
[12:36] one and that only comes by the life of
[12:38] christ because
[12:40] that only god's life is the only life
[12:43] holy enough that for god to accept god
[12:46] cannot accept
[12:47] the life of any man he can only accept
[12:49] his own life
[12:50] and so we realized that now god has got
[12:53] to get his life that's the task
[12:55] how does god get his life into his
[12:58] family's life
[12:59] because they're born in sin enter jesus
[13:02] christ
[13:03] amen he comes in and he he says the
[13:06] except a corn of wheat die it abideth
[13:08] alone
[13:08] so we see that god was never intending
[13:11] to stay bottled up in a single man
[13:13] walking the shores of galilee
[13:15] now comes the book of revelation because
[13:17] now we find that the holy ghost has come
[13:20] and the book of revelation is sent to
[13:22] explain
[13:24] god's working now not in a nazarene
[13:26] walking the shores of galilee
[13:28] but working in his body the church
[13:32] the bride as john would refer to her the
[13:34] elect lady
[13:36] so this is what the book of revelation
[13:38] is all about this is
[13:39] hence the instructions that john says i
[13:42] was in the spirit
[13:43] on the lord's day and so we realized
[13:46] we've proven already don't need to go
[13:47] back over this morning
[13:48] that we are in the day of the lord this
[13:51] is the lord's day and therefore
[13:53] this book becomes prominent to our age
[13:55] it was written
[13:56] sealed up that first stage fell away
[13:59] they couldn't go on to the
[14:01] to the resurrection of the bodies they
[14:02] couldn't get their body changed
[14:04] that's where they were headed they had a
[14:06] perfect ministry they had the full
[14:07] jubilee they had the full abstract they
[14:09] had the full token
[14:11] they had the uh they had the mighty god
[14:13] unveiled
[14:14] they they were ready for invisible union
[14:16] but they begin to fall away after the
[14:19] death
[14:19] of the apostles hence christ must sit
[14:22] down seal the book in seven seals
[14:24] sent back down on the throne rather than
[14:26] stepping forward to take his bride
[14:28] he now must intercede for her across
[14:31] 2000 years of church history
[14:33] promising at the end time that he would
[14:35] once again step forward
[14:36] come forward take the book loose the
[14:39] seals and bring it down to his seventh
[14:41] messenger
[14:42] and then that messenger would take it
[14:44] and feed it to a bride
[14:46] who then now we find ourselves picking
[14:48] back up
[14:49] at the apex where the first age begin to
[14:52] decline we carry it on
[14:54] to the body change this bride of this
[14:57] last day
[14:58] like unlike every other age she's the
[15:01] only one
[15:01] uniquely predestinated to not
[15:05] fall eve fell
[15:09] israel fail when they chose a king they
[15:12] they
[15:12] they the wife of adam fell the wife of
[15:16] jehovah
[15:17] fell when they sought the prophet for a
[15:20] king and the king
[15:21] the prophet tried to tell them god is
[15:23] your king but they wanted
[15:24] man made a system of religion they
[15:27] wanted somebody ruling over them
[15:29] and so they chose a king they chose
[15:31] human government
[15:33] and they committed adultery against god
[15:35] as calling him their true husband
[15:38] we find that the bride of jesus christ
[15:40] fell
[15:41] as she began to fall away by the time
[15:43] you reach the
[15:44] the third age it means married and then
[15:46] the fourth age opens up
[15:49] that she's now they've triple crowned a
[15:51] false prophet
[15:53] and she's dead now god can begin the
[15:56] restoration because that's what he
[15:57] promised he would do
[15:59] all right so just just overviewing a bit
[16:02] uh as we move forward i'm just trying to
[16:04] watch my time
[16:05] so when we come down through our
[16:07] scriptures we find that he's
[16:09] speaking this letter this revelation
[16:12] that god gave unto christ
[16:14] so that christ could give it to the
[16:16] churches all right
[16:17] so now we realize it's not a different
[16:19] god it's just god
[16:20] working in various stages so john says
[16:24] in verse 12 i turned to see the voice
[16:26] notice he didn't turn to see a man
[16:29] he says i turned to see a voice that
[16:31] spake with me
[16:32] and being turned i saw seven lampstands
[16:35] seven golden
[16:36] candlesticks this would represent the
[16:38] church of which christ was walking in
[16:41] the midst of you read that
[16:43] in verse 13. but we find
[16:47] that in verse 13 he's in the midst of
[16:50] seven
[16:50] candlesticks one likened to the son of
[16:53] man
[16:54] so we realize then that one likened to
[16:56] the son of man gerd about the paps
[16:59] shows that now it's entering into
[17:03] he's not gerd about the waste like the
[17:05] priesthood would do
[17:07] offering sacrifices now we're at the
[17:09] time of the day of the lord
[17:11] this is the day of the lord now he's
[17:14] coming
[17:14] in his church she's gird about the paps
[17:17] because it identifies it as a woman
[17:19] but it's christ but it's christ in her
[17:22] and it's the time of the
[17:23] the end it's the day of the lord it's
[17:25] the time when the judgments are coming
[17:27] and so now he his head verse 14
[17:31] his head and his hairs are white like
[17:33] wool now we're back to daniel
[17:34] the seventh chapter the ancient of days
[17:37] that sat on the throne this is where
[17:39] brother branham had such a hard time
[17:41] understanding
[17:42] this one whose hairs were white as wool
[17:45] as white as snow
[17:46] white like wool as white as snow and
[17:48] brother branham said you know he's
[17:50] he's a young man how is he look like an
[17:52] old man
[17:53] this was this was jack's um you know
[17:56] his friend brother jack tried to give
[17:58] him that brother branham said but that
[17:59] just
[18:00] that just didn't seem to work out until
[18:02] the spirit
[18:03] led brother branham back to daniel and
[18:05] he picks it up and realizes
[18:07] that this is the ancient of days come
[18:09] for judgment and so we realize now that
[18:12] that the that the judgments are upon the
[18:14] earth
[18:15] but we realize that the last horse rider
[18:19] uh the pale horse rider cannot begin his
[18:21] full ride he's named
[18:23] by the prophet he's identified as death
[18:26] and a prophet
[18:26] and a prophet in this day shows that
[18:28] it's the conglomeration of
[18:30] all the previous horses but thank god we
[18:33] also have all the previous anointings
[18:34] the lion the ox the man
[18:36] and it's all in the eagle because the
[18:38] eagle is not an earthbound creature the
[18:40] lion the man and the ox are earthbound
[18:42] this is the age that takes a rapture
[18:44] this is the bride under an eagle
[18:46] and and the pale horse rider cannot
[18:49] begin his
[18:50] full ride in earnest until this
[18:53] bride is taken out of the way but before
[18:56] she can be taken out of the way
[18:58] christ must wait and intercede for every
[19:01] name that's still
[19:02] on that lamb's book of life and when
[19:04] that last name is called
[19:05] then we're taken in a physical rapture
[19:08] and we believe in a physical rapture
[19:10] brother branham to his dying day
[19:12] believed in the corporal return
[19:14] of the lord jesus christ we meet him in
[19:17] the air we are changed into glorified
[19:19] bodies
[19:19] that's what believers believe brother
[19:21] branham said
[19:23] so we realized then but now but now
[19:26] we're
[19:26] so now we're finishing up we're
[19:29] reestablishing the original teaching had
[19:31] to be re-established
[19:33] because the full token has to come the
[19:35] full abstract has to return back
[19:37] remember
[19:38] that we found him the alpha and the
[19:40] omega and brother branham shows us in
[19:42] numerous places
[19:44] it doesn't say he's in the middle now of
[19:46] course he's in
[19:47] he's in the in between because you can
[19:49] read it christ is in the midst of the
[19:51] seven lamp stands
[19:53] but he so he is in the midst of his
[19:55] church
[19:56] but it's simply saying that the why he
[19:58] only says alpha and omega and not any
[20:01] anything in between simply means that in
[20:03] the alpha he's in his fullness
[20:05] and in the omega he's in his fullness
[20:07] but the in between
[20:09] while he's in the in between not
[20:11] everything in the in between is him
[20:13] because by this time men have added
[20:15] their doctrines and creeds and dogmas
[20:18] and the church has become polluted she
[20:20] went into the ground
[20:22] god's going to raise her back up but
[20:24] clearly we are
[20:25] at the end time the judgment day his
[20:28] head and his hairs are white like wool
[20:29] verse 15 his feet like undefined brass
[20:32] these are the areas i'm not going to
[20:34] dive down deep into we'll get these in
[20:35] the podcast
[20:36] his voice says the sound of many waters
[20:39] we're at the age where we've had 2 000
[20:42] years so it's
[20:43] many waters we are today uh
[20:46] carrying the baton that was handed off
[20:48] to each new age
[20:50] and now the whole package has been
[20:52] handed back to the hands of the bride
[20:54] and so now the whole world god will be
[20:58] just and condemning him because they
[21:00] didn't have the voice of a few
[21:02] waters they've had the voice of god
[21:04] through 2
[21:05] 000 years the voice of many waters it's
[21:08] his voice it's the judgment brother
[21:09] branham showed us
[21:10] all right verse 16 in his right hand
[21:13] seven stars out of his mouth
[21:15] sharp two-edged sword there's a lot we
[21:18] could break down in there
[21:19] his countenance was as the sun shineth
[21:22] in his strength
[21:23] if as long as you keep daniel in play
[21:26] you'll understand revelation i think
[21:27] there's only
[21:28] uh i don't think there's see how does
[21:31] this go
[21:32] everything that is covered in daniel
[21:36] is covered in revelation and in all of
[21:39] revelation
[21:40] only two chapters don't refer back to
[21:42] something out of daniel
[21:44] so we find that these correlate together
[21:47] and the study of daniel really brings
[21:49] out
[21:50] this verses especially 12 down through
[21:53] uh 16. all right and so
[21:56] um verse 17 and when i saw him i fell at
[22:01] his feet as dead he laid his right hand
[22:03] upon me saying
[22:04] fear not i'm the first and the last
[22:06] verse 18 i'm he
[22:08] that liveth and was dead and behold i
[22:09] live forevermore
[22:11] he's got the keys of death in hell verse
[22:13] 19 he's writing the things
[22:15] watch this now the things which must be
[22:17] seen
[22:18] and the things which are and the things
[22:21] which
[22:22] shall be hereafter so we find then of
[22:25] course the mystery he gives the mystery
[22:26] in verse 20
[22:27] of the stars and the candlesticks so the
[22:30] things which
[22:30] then must be hereafter you find
[22:34] that when he when he's writing write the
[22:37] things which thou has seen and the
[22:38] things which
[22:39] are and the things which shall be
[22:41] hereafter so we're realizing it's
[22:43] prophecy
[22:44] so revelation 1 and 3 uh
[22:48] blessed is he that readeth and they that
[22:51] hear the words of this
[22:52] prophecy prophecy is future
[22:55] revelation 1 19 write the things which
[22:58] thou has seen
[22:59] and the things which are and the things
[23:01] which shall be
[23:02] hereafter so that's prophecy so that's
[23:05] why brother branham could place
[23:07] so much of this and say this is the day
[23:10] of these things
[23:11] because it's mostly prophecy chapter 22
[23:15] and 7
[23:17] behold i come quickly blessed is he that
[23:20] keepeth the sayings of the prophecy
[23:22] of this book 22 18 for i testify under
[23:26] every man
[23:26] that heareth the words of the prophecy
[23:29] of this book
[23:30] if any man shall add unto these things
[23:32] god shall add unto him
[23:33] the plagues that are written in this
[23:35] book revelation 22 19
[23:37] and if any man shall take away from the
[23:40] words of the book of this prophecy
[23:43] constantly it's prophecy god shall take
[23:45] away his part out of the book of life
[23:47] and out of the holy city
[23:49] and from the things which are written in
[23:51] this book
[23:52] so we see then that it's foretelling
[23:54] because it starts out for telling
[23:57] and it's going to show jesus in his
[24:00] future works of what he as the word
[24:04] is going to do in future ages not what
[24:06] he's only done
[24:07] in three and a half years of human
[24:10] ministry
[24:10] but what he as the word now not as the
[24:13] nazarene
[24:14] the same christ and as the word in a
[24:17] people
[24:18] he's going to move all right and we find
[24:21] him you know
[24:22] uh all the way over in
[24:25] you know all the way over in the in the
[24:27] end of the book still declaring
[24:29] it's a book of prophecy all right he
[24:31] deals with revelation 1 20
[24:33] the mystery of the seven stars and the
[24:34] golden candlesticks and there's seven
[24:36] angels and seven churches
[24:38] and so you know this is this is exactly
[24:42] what god
[24:43] said to abraham when he said to abraham
[24:45] look to the stars
[24:47] tell me can you count them so i can't
[24:49] count them said well that's your seed
[24:51] those stars represent your seed
[24:54] galatians 3 and 6.
[24:56] we read that now to abraham look now to
[24:58] abraham
[24:59] galatians 3 16 and his seed
[25:02] were the promises made he he saith not
[25:05] unto seeds as of many
[25:07] but as of one and to thy seed
[25:10] which is christ and so
[25:14] so now out of all uh
[25:17] those that are in christ watch this now
[25:20] so out of
[25:20] all those that are in christ out of all
[25:23] of those
[25:24] stars of god out of all the seed of
[25:27] abraham out of all the believers seven
[25:31] of them
[25:32] are held particularly in his right hand
[25:34] to be deployed
[25:36] in the seven church ages and so now they
[25:39] are for god's purpose they are
[25:41] angels they are messengers to the seven
[25:45] ages they're not supernatural winged
[25:47] creatures we we find that out
[25:49] these are men that god has taken a hold
[25:52] of
[25:53] for a purpose so john 13
[25:56] 20 verily verily i say unto you he that
[25:59] receiveth whomsoever i send
[26:02] receiveth me lot more to say on that
[26:04] perhaps in the service later today
[26:06] and he that receiveth me receiveth him
[26:09] that sent me
[26:10] so we realize that if these seven
[26:13] messengers
[26:14] are seven stars in the right hand of god
[26:17] and he sends them to an
[26:18] age then to receive their message is to
[26:21] receive christ
[26:22] and we realize then that that people who
[26:26] try to say i believe in jesus of
[26:28] nazareth
[26:29] but then they reject the messenger god
[26:32] has sent
[26:34] you can see the log jam that that puts
[26:36] them
[26:37] they have failed the very first word
[26:39] test
[26:40] and so we find them that that
[26:43] god's family the seed of christ
[26:47] are seen as stars he's got seven of them
[26:50] in his right hand for a particular
[26:52] purpose
[26:52] but it's why do you receive the
[26:55] messenger of a star
[26:57] because you're part of the constellation
[26:59] see and so
[27:00] revelation 1 20. i'm going to start
[27:02] winding it up here for today
[27:04] so revelation 1 20 starts the unveiling
[27:07] of the symbols so the candlesticks are
[27:09] the churches seven stars of the
[27:10] messengers
[27:11] seven candlesticks of the sevenfold
[27:13] glory of his
[27:15] person all right his hand in his hair
[27:17] all right
[27:18] represent a judge his eyes are as a
[27:20] flame of fire why because it's the day
[27:22] of the lord
[27:23] and so this is the this is the day he's
[27:26] in
[27:26] judgment you know it's it's it's not the
[27:29] it's not to the world who have
[27:33] rejected him and indicted him he's a
[27:36] judge he's not the gentle lamb
[27:38] he's a judge see but to the bride he's
[27:41] still the lamb of god he's still
[27:43] her atonement he's still her intercessor
[27:45] he's still her companion
[27:47] and you're going to need him until you
[27:49] get out of here trust me
[27:51] and so now you've got to understand that
[27:53] you've got a dual thing happening
[27:55] he's speaking to the bride by the word
[27:58] and the word only which means
[27:59] no mongrelizing of man-made idea
[28:03] it's back to the pure word it's not
[28:06] teaching and teaching only paul said i
[28:08] came not to you
[28:09] in in teaching or word only but in power
[28:13] and demonstration of the holy ghost so
[28:16] back to word and word only you've got to
[28:18] have that to get the restoration of the
[28:20] full complete power
[28:22] so now we realize that his feet then
[28:25] his feet are not like the ones that walk
[28:27] the streets of jerusalem offering grace
[28:29] but rather they're like brass that
[28:31] burned in a fire
[28:32] and he why are they because they're here
[28:34] to stomp out
[28:36] everything that gets in his way
[28:38] everything the enemy does in this last
[28:41] age
[28:41] i'm here to tell you you don't have to
[28:43] worry jesus walks right over the top of
[28:45] it
[28:46] so his voice is the voice of many waters
[28:49] preachers through the ages
[28:50] what's in his right hand stars what
[28:52] about his mouth his mouth
[28:54] his mouth has the word of god his
[28:57] countenance
[28:58] was as the sun shineth in its strength
[29:01] so so then when we when we realize as
[29:04] we're going now to chapter two
[29:06] which is where we're going to break into
[29:07] next time you've got to
[29:09] so every age you're going to find
[29:11] several things consistent
[29:13] every age has their test of the word
[29:17] so so we find out that that whatever the
[29:20] word however it's
[29:21] manifested you've got to build off of
[29:24] that revelation
[29:26] just like you know how how to build the
[29:28] ark there's probably all kinds of boat
[29:30] ship builders in the days of noah but
[29:33] noah wasn't building a ship
[29:34] he wasn't building a mercy hospital ship
[29:36] he was building an
[29:37] ark an ark is what they put the
[29:41] testaments in
[29:42] the ark of the covenant why it
[29:43] represents christ
[29:45] it doesn't represent man-made ingenuity
[29:48] you'll never escape the judgments on
[29:50] man-made
[29:51] ingenuity you're going to have to pass
[29:54] the word test
[29:55] and receive god in the form of his word
[29:58] and so we realized from abraham and lot
[30:01] right on down to the time of jesus
[30:03] those others were parts of jesus but
[30:05] jesus was the fullness of the word
[30:07] he comes to the jews they were the
[30:09] elected people the fullness of the word
[30:12] and then and then so now being the
[30:14] elected people he presented
[30:16] himself to them first but paul picks up
[30:19] in the 13th chapter talking to the jews
[30:22] in their day and we'll stop here
[30:24] then paul and barnabas waxed bold and
[30:27] said it was necessary that the word of
[30:29] god
[30:30] should first have been spoken to you but
[30:33] seeing you put it from you
[30:34] and judge yourselves unworthy of
[30:36] everlasting life lo
[30:38] we turn to the gentiles so so the jews
[30:41] rejected it
[30:42] but god had already said they would yeah
[30:45] amen
[30:45] in isaiah god was already going to blind
[30:48] them
[30:49] and paul speaking of that blindness
[30:51] talks about how that
[30:52] what then israel hath not obtained that
[30:55] which he seeketh for romans 11
[30:57] 7 but the election hath obtained it
[31:01] and the rest were blinded so the reason
[31:03] he blinded them
[31:04] was so that god could turn from the jews
[31:07] to
[31:08] the gentiles because the scripture said
[31:10] had declared
[31:11] that god would take out of the people a
[31:14] bride
[31:15] for uh from the gentiles so he calls
[31:18] israel his wife to jehovah but he calls
[31:21] the true
[31:22] church the bride of christ
[31:25] amen so that's where we'll stop today
[31:28] we're just trying to get launched in
[31:30] that's that chapter one really
[31:33] has to be established firmly in your
[31:34] mind before we move
[31:36] heavily into chapters two and three
[31:38] because that covers the ages let's pray
[31:41] father we thank you for your word today
[31:44] thank you for
[31:45] the audience here among us and those
[31:47] streaming at home
[31:48] we commit the rest of the service and
[31:50] the balance of this day
[31:52] into your perfect control we commit it
[31:54] to you in jesus christ's name
[31:57] amen god bless you thank you for being
[31:58] here today god bless you we'll see you
[32:00] shortly
[32:01] with the main service god bless
