and anoint the speaker and anoint the hearer Lord May May the word come forth Lord to the word Lord we ask this for your glory Lord for your kingdom furtherance we ask in Jesus name amen God bless you all um a couple weeks back I was having some fellowship with a few brothers and brother Matt and I were talking and he about what my burden was and what I'd been going over with Sunday School on the subject of seven women take hold of one man and I know he mentioned it to brother Jason about bringing this on a on a regular service outside of Sunday school so that's what we're doing here I'm going to do my best to get through it I've there's actually there's no way that I'll get through the entire thing I'm just going to try to consolidate it and get it out as much as I can because I'll be gone for quite a while after this so part two will just have to be a repetition of part one actually so so uh I'm gonna do my best to get through but if we can bring up that PowerPoint Ethan seven women take hold of one man as my topic and the scripture we're looking at is Isaiah 4 1 and 2. it's in the email I sent it to the email you got it just not coming up well if you have a Bible or a phone that has a Bible app on it pull it out Isaiah 4 1 and 2. and in that day seven women shall take hold of one man saying we will eat our own bread and wear our own apparel only let us be called by thy name to take away our reproach in that day shall the branch of the Lord be beautiful and glorious and the fruit of the Earth shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped of Israel may the Lord add the blessing to the reading of his word you can be seated well we're having technical difficulties with the PowerPoint and it's definitely critical that we have it or you'll fall asleep is this a lot of reading a lot of quotes that we're going through so looking at that scripture seven women shall take hold of one man that word take hold means to seize or to grab and hold tightly to refrain or support by grabbing hold and as you look at Isaiah 4 1 and 2 there's two parts of it verse one is speaking of well we'll just simplify it and say the bad side of it and part two is looking at the positive side of it on the on in part one you're looking at seven women are going to seize one man and and saying we will make our own provisions in Exodus 21 18 it says if if he take him another wife her food her raiment and her duty of marriage shall he not diminish so this is this is a verse speaking about if uh if a man takes for himself like a second wife he's talking about polygamy we understand that polygamy is is not a new testament Doctrine and it was never encouraged All Through the Bible in the Old Testament it was discouraged told Ken Kings directly not to multiply to themselves wise because it would turn their hearts away from God so in this verse he's saying if you do do that you're not going to take away anything from your first wife because your obligation is to provide her with food and raiment and the duty of marriage so there's an obligation that a man has to be a provider but here in Isaiah 4 this is being turned on its head now the woman is saying no I don't need you to be my provider I don't want I don't want that just let I will provide everything just give me your name to take away my reproach and we can look at this in both the natural and we can look at it in the spiritual so we look at this in other words we look at it in the church world but we can also look at it in the natural realm where feminism has taken hold and we're going to speak we're going to speak more about that there's been a specific process that Satan has done over the last several hundred years in order to attack the foundations of the word of God in order to get to this place of a Satan's Eden today brother Branham says and Wrecking recognizing your day and its message silly women LED away with diverse lusts Hollywood all this kind of stuff bobbed hair wearing shorts wearing makeups all this kind of stuff which is Unbecoming did you know the woman plays a great part in the last days you know the Bible said that that those who Escape out of this great damnation will be a beautiful Branch before the Lord someday I'll get to the to it the Lord willing for it for you women let you see what God thinks of the woman that really escaped this damnation of this day said she would be beautiful so okay we got it said she would be beautiful so we look here and we see this both sides of it you have on the one side Satan is completely against what a real woman is supposed to be why is Satan against what a real woman is supposed to be why is he muddying that and making it so perverted why is he even making it hard for Christian women to understand what it means to be a woman why is he doing that why why do you think he's doing that because in this very age he's going to have a bride who won't fall who won't do what Eve did he's going to have a bride that won't pervert one word and fall away from it he's going to have a bride that overcomes and is going to prove to Satan that that's the case see and so that why do you think Satan is doing what he's doing today and making Mass confusion purpose it's purposeful he could see the prophecy of scripture he could see what direction God was going and what he was bringing and so he's going to pervert the whole thing and as we look at it on the spiritual side you see there's seven women take hold of one man and say we'll have our own bread and wear our own clothes think about that for a second her own garments and her own food see apply that spiritually what is what is bread the bread of life the word of God the word manifested we will have our own word we want our own version of the word we will supply it see the churches not Christ see Christ is the one who is going to bring the word Christ is going to bring a Vindicated word of God but this woman says um I'll bring my own bread only let me be called by my name let me be called as a Christian and let me provide my own raiment is what she says what what what's that speaking of We're the bride is to be clothed in the word of God he's to be what she's to be Washed by the Water of the word this bride she don't want that she provides her own Scarlet colored robe so you see that on the spiritual side the the the the the the the woman the church wants to make her own Supply wants to be her own provider she wants to carry Christ around she wants him under her submission just be let me be called by your name she wants Christ on a leash carried around which way wherever that she wants to go but of course Christ will never be under their headship just that's what they want and that's what they're acting as and that's what they're presenting before the world woman above the man woman controlling the man what do you think is happening in our society same thing same thing but then you have the other side of it you have the true bride of Christ you have a true woman under her headship saying Amen to her Vindicated headship saying Amen to the word that's brought brought forth Christ sends a prophet that's how he always brings his word he sends a prophet they say no thank you one side the other side says amen thank you God for vindicating yourself showing me your very presence bringing forth the open word into my heart not only doing that but bringing it so I can feed on it and become that word that's where the beauty lies brothers sisters that's where your beauty lies taking what Christ has delivered to us and remaining under his headship that's Beauty that's what God loves that's what God Delights in I heard the word this is from recognizer in your day and its message I heard a woman the other day laughing at a girl a bunch of half-naked females with low morals lower than a mother dog laughing at an old woman with a long dress listen here your little twisted up female she's got something you know nothing about she's got moral you don't even know what the name is you lost it in the Cradle almost you don't even know right from wrong she does she's got something hid in her heart that you don't know nothing about you lost it can never find it don't you call her old-fashioned and so forth like that she knows something that you don't know nothing about she's got hit in her heart Treasure of decency you don't know one word of it your mommy brought you up like that your pastor permitted it shows where he stands I'm preaching about him right here now see we look at these words and we hear them as harsh but and they are harsh but they're nothing but the truth this is what God this is what is beautiful and this is what God loves a treasure of decency morals these things these things are things that we should hold before us why would we be deceived by the nonsense in the world it's so far away from light it's a complete darkness they they offer you freedom no they they're not offering you Freedom are you blind they're offering you a bouquet of roses with a knife right in the middle yeah and it's going to damage and hurt and harm you Christ is not offering you that he's offering you a real bouquet a real wedding garment a real unmerited Grace ring that he'll slip on your finger amen flashing red light of the sign of his coming and said even seven women will grab one man and said we'll do our own work let us just take your name to take away our our reproach but he said how glorious will that little branch that escapes all these things it'll be Holiness under the Lord in that day when real genuine born-again women know their place though they be laughed at and called silly in old-fashioned everything but act like a woman like a lady stand like a woman dress like a woman talk like a woman Live Like a Lady I said this before but how is it that the devil will come against you sisters and you look at your life and you say I've I'm I'm a housewife what do I have to show for my life my this person and that person has this career and they did this and they did this I feel sorry for him they have they have all they have a career and they have this and they have that but where's the family where's the priorities where's God's word in this in this thing God looks at the Homemaker and the woman that raises her family and says there there is the Glorious one there is the worthy one that's what God is looking to and looking for but they were perverted until they become become so common that women become so common they they lived men lived with men the natural perversion from the sex cells and changed its positions because that women had become so cheap look brother Ben I'm speaking so straight every one of us knows what he's talking about we're living brother Branham was living in the seed time this was just a seed back then he was recognizing something that everybody else said was he talking about we're looking at I said my goodness is he living now prophetically he was living now yeah a few days ago I was over Tucson went to get a loaf of bread and there was a boy sitting out there and two little boys in the car another come in get a pack of cigarettes the old grade headed gentleman looked down said who is this cigarettes for your mother and he said well I think it's a rotten skipping some portions just to for brevity's sake and he said well I think it's a rotten shame today to see of how said used to be we put women on a pedestal said we honored her we took off our hat in her presence we walked down the streets and gentlemen would hear somebody make a remark about a certain woman they'd slap him down see and said they honored women but he said sir women has brought it on themselves said now they don't get up they used to get up in A Streetcar lady get up every man would take his hat off and let her sit down said now it's a push crowd said they have brought it on themselves and that's the truth the devil hole of Hollywood Yonder produced it out on the televisions and magazines though the thing has become a great big pot of Filth that's right what a perversion that's been produced out of entertainment it's a it's it's it's a deception and young people and all of us we we live around that and we see these things and what does it do if you if you feed on it too much and you're not acting with wisdom and discretion what happens you start to get pulled down and dragged down this direction and what what ends up happening oh why am I not living like that why am I they're those people have know nothing about life those people know nothing about what is good and what is right they don't know anything about how to live why do you think many of them are suicidal and using drugs and alcohol and they hate their lives don't try to be like them don't try to live like them all that is despair and destruction Revelation 17 4 and 5 5 and the woman was a raid in purple and scarlet color and Deck with gold and precious stones and Pearls having a golden cup in her hand full of Abominations and filthiness of her fornication and upon her forehead was a name written mystery Babylon the great the mother of harlots and Abominations of the Earth this was the fruit of her actions this is the fruit of the worldly Church she is clothed in her own clothes not what Christ provided what she has provided by deceiving the people and by and and by killing murdering the people the very fruit that she's fruit of the vine that she's drinking is actually the blood of the Saints that's what she's drinking this is Mystery Babylon the great mother of harlots so she's a mother it's not just the Roman Catholic Church the Orthodox church but the denominational systems as well they've entered into the same thing It's all under the Same Spirit many of the non-denominational churches of our day are the same they've provided their own clothing they provided their own riches they provided their own food provided their own drink and Christ is cast out of the church he's on the outside he's already sent a message knocking at that door it's that that's already been sent he's still knocking but the message has been sent it's been fulfilled he's knocked at the door and said come come out of her my people that message is still going forth and there's still people coming out but it's been sent and he's on the outside Christ has been manifested and put on display and they said we're rich and increase with goods and have need of nothing see exactly Isaiah 4 verse 1. let us be called by your name but we don't want anything to do with what you're delivering to us we don't want your Vindicated word we want our own theology but then on the other side Revelation 19 6-8 and I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude and as the voice of many Waters and is the voice of Mighty thundering saying Alleluia for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife hath made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints relate this to Ephesians chapter 5 he washed Christ washes us with the washing of Water by the word he says this fight that fine linen is the righteousness of saints I want to ask you where did they get the fine linen do they make it themselves no that breaks up the type it was provided for them and he even washed it for them he provided it for them he washed it for them he brought everything to them so that she could make herself ready she said amen she was a recipient she received she in other words she entered she submitted to her husband she said she said yes I will serve you yes I will love you because the word was delivered she saw him she met him it's an invisible Union this is not a future invisible Union the invisible Union's going on right now we're waiting and we're gonna go to the marriage supper of the lamb but we're already married we're already joined invisibly Hallelujah so Ephesians 5 22-24 wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the Lord wow nobody said amen not one sister said amen wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the Lord is that right this is a script this is scriptural truth this is not cultural this is not for historical reference this is for you today this is for you sisters who are wives to submit to your husbands and the next verse husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body therefore as the church is subject unto Christ so let the wives be to their own husbands in everything what if we say we want to live in a modern way in today's day and age and we want our husband it should be only a mutual submission that's what egalitarianism all through the church tells you denominational systems that's what they'll that's what they'll tell you it's only a mutual submission that's what they take this verse and they reinterpret it in 17 different ways and all of a sudden it's only a mutual submission that's it but the scripture says that the wives should be subject to their husbands in everything why is it said everything Why didn't it just say just just leave it at let their wives be subject to their own husbands see I'm trying to emphasize everybody feels uncomfortable and weird when you preach about this but you apply the Bible to your life and that's what we're supposed to do in the church that's what we're supposed to as Ministers of the Gospel we don't get to pick and choose even what we're preaching if the Lord lays something on our heart we that's where we go and if everybody kicks you out you just say thank you Lord I'm going to preach to the posts God is able from these posts to raise up children to Abraham and that that's the type Christ delivers the word and the church needs to be subject to that word see it's not we deliver the word and then then we're then Christ has to be subject to our judgments and our thoughts and our ideas no that's that's reversing the type that's what the whole church world does but you don't reverse the type there certainly is a mutual submission the verse just before that speaks about that submit to one another but then it goes into detail in the in the relationship of husband and wife the husband is the leader he is the head headship speaks of leadership a woman is to submit to her husband a husband should be the type of leader that loves his wife not as a dictator if we read the next verse husband love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it so we see that this love is characterized as self-sacrifice so it sees the need and it runs directly I think of what brother Jason has been preaching about this Christ ran directly to the need he didn't run away he had every opportunity to run away in Gethsemane it's a dark garden easy to slip away into the mountains no problem but he didn't do that he said who are you looking for see that was Christ rushing to meet the need of his bride see and that's husbands just as David he didn't run away from Goliath he ran directly to Goliath see and you as men you as husbands that should be your approach if there's danger if there's difficulty if if there's a need there you should run towards the need not not just say oh my wife will take care of that this will no you run towards the need to make sure that need is met in your family for your wife for your children that's your duty that's your love to your wife is to give yourself give of yourself that he Christ might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of Water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish see again this is Christ making the provision of what we have need of the church got spotted by denominationalism so what did he do he made the provision he sent a Reformation he sent Luther he sent Wesley sent he sent the the Pentecostal Revival and then he sent Malachi for brother branham's Ministry to restore us back to the original Faith he did what it took to wash us with the washing of Water by the word and that's our duty as husbands is to rush to meet those needs and sacrifice ourselves for our wives and love her in such a way that she would not begrudgingly submit herself sometimes wife you have to begrudgingly submit yourself to your husband because you've you feel like he doesn't deserve it but you're not obey you're doing it unto the Lord right and not unto men just like at your job you're you're doing your work as unto the Lord and not unto men same for you sisters to your husband sometimes you don't deserve it and so you're saying I'm doing it unto the Lord but husband don't live like that you don't deserve it we all do sometimes Genesis 3 16 under the woman he said I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception in sorrow Thou shalt bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee this is the woman's curse the curse upon even all women after her and my goodness what what in the world does that have to do with eating an apple every time I read that it just is shocking to me that a person could believe from reading this verse that she ate an apple realize they're naked God says well since you use your teeth and your digestive system incorrectly I'm gonna curse a completely unrelated bodily system does it make sense to me so here here he speaks this your desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee this is part of the curse his ruling over her now we'll comment more on that later but I want to read this before I do First Timothy 2 12-14 but I suffer not a woman to teach nor to use serp authority over the man to be in silence for Adam was first form then Eve and Adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression so let's take that understanding that thought right there back to this people say that this is what they use to justify what they call egalitarianism and so when I when I say that is it's only Mutual submission there's no husband a wife submitted to a husband that's all done away with they think in in the gospel because they say that the curse puts the husband as the ruler over the woman and therefore the gospel takes that curse away now men and women are equal in every way and she can preach and have leadership positions in the church and all those things never mind what Paul said we don't have to listen to Paul we like what Jesus said you don't even know what Jesus said if you say you like what Jesus said you have you have no clue but that's the first step of apostasy over and over again is that they say that was what Paul said not what Jesus said so if anybody says that you see you you can just simply say I'm so sorry you just took the first step to apostasy and so here we have the curse saying he shall rule over her but understand this word rule doesn't merely mean headship or leadership it means rule with rigor so now the woman is put in this relationship that her desires to her be to her husband and now because of sin he is going to rule her as though she is only his property and that you find that throughout history if you study it closely that this was the approach that all ancient cultures took all of them Christ does bring Redemption but he doesn't change this role as you'll see it isn't the curse that made Adam the head that's not the curse that made Adam the head look what it says why is a woman not allowed to teach and preach and handle God's word or usurp authority over the man it doesn't say because of the curse because it says because Adam was first formed then Eve so by God's design Adam had headship and the woman was under submission now we'll talk about the Redemption in Christ Jesus a little bit just in a few moments First Corinthians 3 7 likewise you husbands dwell with them according to knowledge giving honor unto the wife as unto a weaker vessel and as being heirs together of the grace of life that your prayers be not hindered so here Peter is speaking live with her according to knowledge what knowledge Peter well a lot of people have different interpretations for it but if the very verse speaks of it right there what knowledge are we to have she's a weaker vessel physically she's weaker that's very clear you don't have to be a tremendous scientist and biologist to know that although you'd think think so today because all our biologists and scientists say that that's not true but it's merely a propaganda put forward by this feminist culture and feminist Society a woman is weaker than a man it's very clear God God designed them us that way that's the first thing to have an understanding of she's a weaker vessel what's the next thing to have an understanding that your heirs together of the grace of life so these are the things that these are the knowledge that we should have in our relationship with our wives men why is that important well she is not an heir of of God's grace through you or because of you she is directly an heir of CR of Grace directly your your co-heirs together see you you equally have a relationship if in a relationship the husband has no relationship with Christ and the wife has a relationship with Christ we want to change that but that's that's nothing's hindering her from her walk with the Lord if her husband isn't see now there'll be hindrances and there'll be difficulties and there'll be trials that's not something that Paul suggests or or speaks about but he does speak about how to do it Peter speaks about how to how to win your husband and so but these are the these are the things of knowledge that we should have and giving honor to the wife see we're to give honor we're to live in such a way that it would be characterized by Honor towards our wife there's no uh you know my wife she does this you know these kind of comments we should be the biggest Defender of our wives we should be the people that say if someone says a word against our wife it should be close to a fight you say you say you're a preacher advocating for fighting I'm a preacher advocating for honoring your wife to the point that it's not acceptable for anyone to say a word against my wife it's not acceptable I don't accept it period because she has a place of honor in my heart and he says your if if you don't live this way if you don't dwell with her according to this knowledge your prayers will be hindered so it's a hindrance to your spiritual life men if you're not living with your wife in this way with this understanding see we have this treasure in Earthen vessels so that that's to look back here she is the weaker vessel it's speaking of how our bodies are designed even further you could say and look I gotta get rid of this thing I'm gonna be sweating through everything for the first time brother Matt I'm getting rid of my jacket so let's move on let's move on I got so much to to go through so men and women are equal but not the same created for a different purpose men and women are different at the cellular level every cell is marked as either female male or female all of our DNA is impacting every aspect of our bodies and it's all marked male or female men have denser bones larger hands greater muscle mass men tend to be more aggressive and as a result have a greater tendency to be attracted to conflict and competition and Leadership women women tend to be attracted to nurturing and relationship building men tend to compartmentalize women tend to connect men are wired to lead women are wired to nurture or I would say influence I want to see I want you to see Jesus approach to women I want you to understand what the normal approach to women was in by the rabbis in the days of Jesus even to this day we're gonna we're gonna go to Israel my wife will be with me she cannot come with me to the to the side of the the Western Wall that I can go to she has another place to go to here's a little spot for the women over here here's the big spot and a whole air conditioned thing for the men see and that's that's how the Jewish rabbis of those days looked at it women were not allowed to listen to and follow the rabbi they had no school for training women to know the word of God they didn't want women to even know the word of God other than how to keep a kosher house that's all that's all they needed to know the rest were for men there was never a rabbi that had a woman following her around following him around never it was unthought of unheard of and it didn't happen right so look let's look at the Lord Jesus and see if he takes the same approach who also when he was in Galilee followed him and Minister unto him and many other women which came up with him unto Jerusalem so here's this strange rabbi who's got men disciples and he's got women following him serving him and listening and feeding on the word of God Mark 16 9-11 now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week he appeared first to Mary Magdalene out of whom he had cast Seven Devils she went and told them that had been with him as they mourned and wept and they when they had heard that he was alive had been seen of her believe not now in those in that time in that day and age if you wanted to have make up a story about something Supernatural like this you would definitely never have a woman involved if the first you tell the story people would look at you going I wouldn't mention that part the woman was the first one to see him that's that's but God sovereignly ordained this circumstance that the very first person to meet him was Mary Magdalene amen not because he wanted to make women preachers but this was a woman who had a testimony and she went and told it that's that's you have a sisters you have a testimony tell it so he he brings her she sees him they go and tell him and guess what they thought woman crazy woman they didn't believe her this was the norm of the society at this point in time but this was not Jesus approach this was a this was a correction John 4 7 there cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water Jesus saith unto her give me to drink Jesus said I must need to go by Samaria okay the disciples didn't like that much they didn't like Samaritans they didn't want to come near Samaritans and Samaritans hated them so strange and then the next thing they know they go off to get food and they come back and he's talking to a prostitute but what was it he was sent there for that predestinated seed in that woman that that is the value that Jesus has for men and for women see he's gonna he's not just gonna go after some man he's going after that predestinated seat and it's in both men and women she goes out she says come see a man which told me all things that ever I did is not this the Christ then they went out of the city and came unto him again he goes to Samaria and he has a the very first person that's testifying of him is a pro ill-famed woman strange way of doing things but this is God's Sovereign leadership and work he's setting things in order Proverbs 31 I'm going I'm gonna I'm just gonna reference that and I'm gonna read to you the points that come from that because up I'm not going to get anywhere near where I need to get this time so The Virtuous Woman She's trustworthy she seeks wool and flax willingly works with her hands plans and provides a variety of foods for household Rises early in the morning to prepare a meal for the family she looks Works along with her husband to expand the household business and finances so she considers a field and buys it and plants a Vineyard she inspects the things her household is producing and will do what it takes to make sure that it's quality she works on providing clothing for a family she has a heart heart to provide for the poor she doesn't fear various seasons of life because she makes provision for them and trusts God through them she prospers from hard work and so does her family her husband is honored because of her she not only supplies for the needs of her family she makes additional materials and sells them she's a strong and honorable woman she's wise and kind she's not idle or lazy her focus is not on outward Beauty and charm but on the character that's produced by the fear of the Lord if you ever read through Proverbs 31 Woman these are the things that it's talking about it's incredible when you see it now if you look at it again it's a problem I've said this in in the uh Sunday school but this is a proverb it's not saying you have to go out and do every single bullet point it's saying this is the characterization of The Godly woman in the sermon the Rapture now when I say when I say that I want you to understand it's the characterization of a Godly woman now where in that did it speak about having a great education where in that did it I'm not against I'm not advocating ignorance I'm saying the vision of God for sisters for young women for women is this that he's putting pushing forward that he's putting forward this is an industrious person this is not a lazy person this is not someone that isn't doing things but the values of this world are not in that in those verses what this world values what's important to this world this world's education system is of what God no not God this world's approach to family is from the devil okay so then we should take God's approach to Womanhood and God's approach to manhood this message isn't about that but I just feel on my heart three different times Paul speaks about the importance of working with your hands to men he speaks of that and not of all of us are built that way to work with your hands I am not a person that is good at working with my hands brother Aaron Brother Brad brother Matt good at working with their hands brother Chris Travis Tony you don't feel left out if I left somebody out forgive me Brother John everybody but me and Caleb but the point being is God is giving a vision of working hard learning to work hard you look at today what is the world going towards it's moving all men away from his feminizing men and what God what the word of God is saying work with your hands so young men learn a trade learn how to work with your hands if you go towards a trade you will be a wealthy person you will make money because ain't nobody wants to do that anymore now there's nobody clamoring to work in the sewer system if you go work in the sewer system you will make money if you go work as a plumber all these different things HVAC carpentry you will be able to make money to do what to provide for a family to have a wife to have children this is God's vision for us very few people are called to be like Paul was and be single most of us are called to have families and so sisters God's not calling you to have a great education and a great career you might have one you you might have to do that okay there's situations and circumstances that demand that but most of all the vision that God has pointing us to is not that why why am I how education and wisdom of this world has turned the church into a bunch of ragweeds it's exactly this is prophetic because this is exactly what it is think about 1965. was that true in seed form my goodness aren't you longing to go back to the good old days of 1965 when people respected God's word what do they what do they look at it today but it was in seed for him he's this is a prophet looking ahead to our day and age it's just a bunch of ragweeds it's education and the educational system and Science and civilization is of the devil it's the devil's civilization the Bible said so don't go don't say oh that's brother Branham but he says education's okay no don't just take a minute now think about this because what is our educational system especially in America but worldwide going towards you what is it training you towards if it's not training you to learn a trade it's training you to be a wonderful communist that's what it's training to be that's what our elementary school is going towards that's what middle school or whatever you call it here is going towards that's what high school is going towards and that's what general education in University and colleges is pointing you towards that's what it's going towards you want to sit in front of that and feed on that you want to be indoctrinated into that you want to spend 10 10 20 30 000 a year on that go learn to work with your hands young men learn to be a keeper at home sisters that is not what I told you is not of the devil you might not like it but it's not it's from God this system of education is of the devil and that applies worldwide if you're an Islamic country if you're in a Catholic country if you're in a secular country it's all of the devil cultures change but the word of God does not change our world has changed so drastically over the last 220 years it's almost unrecognizable to the world before that and see this was all part of the development of Satan's Eden brother Brandon so adeptly says and prophetically says no other age is referred to as the God of this evil age other than our age of course Satan was the root has been the ruler since the Fall In the Garden of Eden but it's been so congealed today everything about our age is designed by the devil to come against what God is doing in the bride of Christ so number one prior to the Industrial Revolution we had agrarian societies divided into landowners and lower classes then in the 1700s and 1800s the Industrial Revolution came husbands and wives roles during The Agrarian time very obvious very clear very Undisputed didn't matter if you were a Muslim or a Christian or whatever you were you had you had a it was easy to understand what the roles were but now the Industrial Revolution comes and then what happens is it becomes a confusion begins the roles start out clear they start to get muddier during industry the birth of Industry brought forth what women and child labor outside of the home and it destroyed lives those those corporations all they cared and those companies all they cared about was that turning a profit they damaged and killed millions of people around the world world in order to produce Mass produce their products and send them throughout the world even starting in the 1700s it's horrible if you read the history about it these things that happened and the breakdown of society that happened in the world over but is you can read about it very easily in England where now you have what they call the street urchins little little boys and little girls whose parents are on the bottle drunk drunks and not providing for their families just going to work and drinking the rest of their time away in misery and children fending for themselves by the tens of thousands on the streets of England and around the world that's the birth of Industry that's the birth of the middle class what a great elevation that they achieved the age of mass production then is after the birth of Industry that further blurs the lines that's where you see women entering into the work workplace that's where you see a man going off to War and the workplace full of women and the home the home where's what's where's where are the children they're being sent off to indoctrination School then we go get to the digital Revolution and where's the Lions we don't know what lines are the lines don't even exist and the result of all this is that nobody knows even what a woman is anymore or what a man is you go to a university professor today go to any University what's a woman you can go they have gender studies can you imagine what is gender studies going to do for anybody make them an idiot that's what it's going to do make them a complete ignoramus see why would anyone take such a class well it's indoctrination what is a Woman They say well it's someone who says they're a woman well what is that no idea so now here we get to Glass this time so Encyclopedia Britannica speaking of women wearing pants now these things coincide all together while there were some women who championed pants in the 19th century pants as an acceptable everyday clothing option for women didn't truly catch on until the mid 20th century there were short-lived revivals of pants wearing in public by women such as during World War One when civilian women who took over jobs traditionally held by men sometimes wore pants during World War II pants were more widely worn by civilian and military women both at work and socially although women continue to enjoy wearing pants after the war particularly for sport or Leisure style trends for women remain fixated largely on skirts or dresses until the 60s and 70s then buoyed by the women's right right in their own thing the inspiration of it then buoyed by the women's rights movement pants became firmly established as popular and appropriate clothing options for women at home in public and in many workplaces Smithsonian Institute see this is mainstream just telling it like it is you don't even hardly have to be spiritual to understand that this is not connected with the spirit of God by the 1920s it was fashionable for women particularly in cities to where more conspicuous makeup this shift reflected the growing influence of Hollywood and its glamorous new film stars as well as the fashion of theater stars and Flappers painted women could now also listen identify as respectable women they weren't respectable women but they were identifying as such even as they wore dramatic mascara eyeliner Dusky eyeshadow and lipstick like the stars of the screen this is the Denver Public Library Western history resources in 1920 an estimated 5 000 Beauty parlors were in operation in the United States by 1930 that number jumped to over forty thousand the cause of all this growth growth meet the Bob and the wave Bob's short hairstyles cut straight around the head usually around jaw level were sported by a few women in the 1910s most notably listened by designer Coco Chanel dancer Irene Castle and actress singer polar the anticipant antithesis of the long pinned up or braided hairstyles that had dominated Western women's fashion for nearly seven centuries bobbed hair was at first a daring symbol of feminism and individuality as clear as I'm going to preach on it I just read it and we'll move on they look however the look however gained widespread appeal in the 1920s as film stars like Gloria Swanson Clara Beau and Louise Brooks popularized the style in general women's hairstyles in the 1920s aspired to be exotic and Sleek with hair worn close to the head if one had long hair it was pulled back in a small low whatever that word is Bobs were cut into in tapered layers so that the hair would lie as flat as possible by the mid-1920s the fat of bobbing had arrived in the mainstream they were they were there were short boyish Bobs like Josephine Bakers and even faux Bob's long-haired deceptively pinned up so you see this direction is coming from Hollywood it's coming from the societal the Civilized civilization developments that the devil has inspired so going along with that is what I've spoken of is feminism first wave of feminism was in the 18th century late 18th century through through 19th century promotion of equal contract and property rights for women in the opposition to chattel marriage and ownership of married women and their children by their husbands however by the end of 19th century active activism focused primarily on gaining political power particularly the right of women's suffrage second wave women's Liberation challenging the cultural and legal validity of the patriarchy and the social and sexual hierarchies used to control and limit the legal and physical independence of women in society third wave see these are these are the waves of satanic Revival Satan's Revival sent on a society and then the church is right behind that you see both the church see this is you can put this these are liberals yeah come on okay but remember that the conservatives are just a little bit further back response to the liberals so as the Liberals go left the conservatives follow them this way don't don't be deceived and so this is dismantling any gender roles whatsoever and you can see what the results are what's produced this madness of you can you can choose your gender gender isn't based on biology gender is uh social construct uh if you're a woman and you feel like you're a man you can say you're a man if you're a man you feel like a woman you could say you're a woman where's that coming from it's directly connected to the slide the downward slide of feminism dismantling of society the dismantling of God's plan for the family the God's plan for a man and God's plan for a woman they've dismantled it they've fought against it they've done everything to battle against it and in society they've prevailed but in the true bride of Christ they have not prevailed we're pushing back against it we're fighting against it and we're never going to compromise and we're never we're never going to back off in fact we're going to push harder and we're going to fight harder as time goes on because God has a plan for you and that's the place of blessing that's the place of joy is doing it God's way doing it the world's way is the place of destruction sorrow First Corinthians 6 9 and this is the result of all of this is feminization of manhood and the feminization of the church look what Paul says know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God be not deceived neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers nor effeminate nor abusers of themselves with Mankind and Paul goes on but I just want to pull that word effeminate God looks at this and it's an Abomination to him it says those who are going towards effeminism cannot enter the kingdom of God a man dressed to dress like a man a woman should dress like a woman and act like a woman a man should act like a man when a man begins to act like a woman he's effeminate it's exactly right brother Jason it's a spirit on the man pushing him towards that pulling him towards that and he must be delivered from that evil spirit and get because Paul in this says and such were some of you but you're washed you're Justified by the spirit of our God and so but you have to be washed you have to repent you can't remain if you can't get the Holy Ghost and remain effeminate when you get the Holy Ghost it makes a man into a man and it makes a woman into a woman so culture became feminized man now is portrayed as a self-centered dummy led by wise and Powerful women deadening of Manliness comes from video game addiction also the proliferation of estrogens and food water and clothing women work and lead the family if the man works too but he remains disconnected unaware just whatever his wife tells him to do go this way okay uh or this way now do the that's that's what modern man is all masculinity becomes toxic so a man being a man is not acceptable in today's society you should shut up and sit down that's that's the that's the approach of our society men respond to this by checking out well just enjoy my video games and my sports and my beer or by becoming more like women well if if if it's only acceptable for me to show leadership if I act like a woman I'll just become one brother Branham speaks of the perversion of the food supply did you read this year this month's Reader's Digest that men and women of this day little girls from 20 or 25 years old is in menopause that you go through the change of life and the middle age of life according to science between 20 and 25 used to be around 30 or 35 of my age and my mother's age a woman never struck menopause still she was 45. 40 or 45 what is it it's through science and the food the hybrids that's perverted the whole human body until we've become a bunch of massive corruption well if the physical being is corrupted isn't the brain cell in that physical being in thirst he says but the way they are on the street today haircut like a man wearing men's clothes and then men turn around wearing women's clothes and a haircut like a woman see it's a perversion the whole thing your food is perverted your life is perverted your thirst perverted your desire is perverted it's a day of perversion so estrogen is everywhere soy is in every snack soy is a phytoestrogen so he's in every snack so he's in baby formula vegetable oils and every snack it's in meat and dairy products and tap water bottled water bpas and Plastics phthalates and lotion make up laundry Products plastic wrap birth control pills in our water supply and what is that resulting in testosterone is suppressed when there is excess estrogen in your system when suppressed from Young ages of development it leads to the feminization of boys over the past 50 years human sperm counts appear to have fallen by more than 50 percent around the globe according to an updated review of medical literature there's an incr In from from this proliferation of estrogen there's an increase of risk of breast and cervical cancer weight gain fibroids in the uterus fatigue enlarged breasts in men high blood pressure blood clots Etc what a corruption that Satan has put on this evil age and you see in every direction you see this taking place as science civilization education is all of the devil Satan has worked for the last 250 years to produce what we have today both in our in the foods that we eat in the educational system that we have in the entertainment system that we have in the news corporations that we have I mean you can't even read the news anymore what's what's the truth you have no idea all of them are simply propaganda machines everything is spun it's just like uh John Collins all kinds we got all these facts here let me show you all these facts I have documents I have this I have that but it really means this and it really means that okay CNN MSNBC you can't you can't trust the Spin Doctors that's what they all that every one of them is Spinda that's the society we live in what where can we go to what can we trust I'll suggest that we have a book here that God inspired the men that wrote it we can put our trust in every word in it and furthermore he sent a prophet to vindicate the Revelation that's contained inside of this book and so he he manifested himself put himself on display and we can put our confidence in that not in the arm of flesh but in the god who moves amongst his people and then it goes to the church the church has been feminized church is feminized spirituality and worship it's emotion-based touchy-feely focused self-help centered Jesus came to give me unconditional Emotional Love regardless of my sinfulness and see this whole better not talk too much on that in today's Church the gospel is no longer about saving the world against impossible odds it's about finding a happy relationship with a wonderful man it's not about seeing the Plan of Redemption the way brother Branham laid it out it's not about that it's not about repentance Jesus the Jesus of the Bible says as many as I love I rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent the the ones the the church is trying to make everything more palatable to the world don't try to make it more palatable to the world they think you're crazy anyway we're trying to get them to hear the word and repent we're trying to tell them they're wrong we're not trying to say oh let's be a little bit let's be pretty much wrong so you can come and join our church and send us your money we don't care about that we're trying to save a world against impossible odds we're trying to bring Deliverance to people that are captive of the devil which are in the middle of a war we're not in a marketing campaign we're not in an advertising business we're here to proclaim the word if you don't like it run out the door if you do like it run to the altar that's the message that we're preaching and proclaiming has nothing to do with trying to make it appealable to a modern age it's trying to get them to repent and come to life but that's the that's the churches we feminized it because we don't want to confront anything we want to make it nice we want to make it comfortable we want to make sure we have a nice coffee shop wonderful place for everybody to sit comfortable nice how about a Pulpit that preaches the word of God how about a place that people come in and they hear the word of God and they say amen and they they love God with all their heart and their rugged individuals a bunch of soft soap babies that we have in our society today there are a bunch of women is what they are and that's a that's an insult to you women to even say that because you women are rugged Christians you sit here and hear this things preached and it's a reproach to the world but you're sitting there saying amen that's a real lady a woman and something else but a real lady will sit and hear the word of God and say Amen but these men they're all they're a bunch of soft soap babies you look at preachers like Andy Stanley and all these Joel Osteen's sisified men cystified men and these Spirits want to get over and they want to get on us but we're going to push back we're gonna fight because we have a message to Proclaim and they might not like it you might not like it but we've got to Proclaim it anyways and we've got to make we've got every one of us has to make our stand you'll be an oddball yeah you were told that yeah but people will make fun of me you were told that the Bible tells you that the prophet tells you that you know that's going to come you're supposed to be persecuted a little bit if you're not there's really something wrong with you Jesus told us we would be hated for taking the stand that we did well what in the world then you make the stand and you get hated and you say man I better be a little bit nicer I better be a little bit more diplomatic the next time I said it no don't be don't do that speak the word preach the truth you don't have to be a jerk about it but you also don't have to be a soft soap baby take a stand this isn't about finding a happy relationship Jesus said take up your cross and follow me joyful things come from having a relationship with Jesus Christ and having fellowship with Jesus Christ but it's far different than merely having a happy human relationship because he calls us to do things that will get us in trouble will get us hated and disrespected true Womanhood is a beautiful reflection of the bride of Christ [Music] true manhood is a beautiful reflection of Christ I'm sorry everybody I'm going I'm going late you'll just have to forgive me and and love me anyways but I'll be gone for a month and a half so you you'll get a rest from me Colossians 3 18 and 19 wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as it is fit in the Lord husbands love your wives and be not bitter against them wives submit we talked about this before we're going to talk we're talking about it again because we're going to get get deeper into this over the next 20 minutes or so submit yourselves to your own husband as is fit in the Lord notice he says add as it is fit or as it's right or as it's uh applicable in the Lord see now if your husband is asking you to disobey the word of God whoa whoa no no God's word says this I I have to obey that I have to stay by that husbands love your wives don't be bitter this means to rule as a dictator do not rule over your wife as a dictator love her leader with love speak to her with love she she is a relational being you're not as much of a relational being as she is but she is and you have to love her according to that in the Rapture brother Branham says I remember that night before I seen that I seen the preview of the Bride I stood there and seen a beautiful little lady just correctly dressed in things marching this way there was somebody standing by me in the vision and I seen they said the preview of the Bride Seen Her Go by they come on this side and went around I heard it coming up the church is coming up from this other side there come the Asian Church oh you're talking about filth here come the European Church oh my and then I heard a rock and roll coming and it was a Miss America the church and she didn't even have on any clothes she had papers like newspapers gray holding in front of her dancing by rock and roll Miss America the church I mean what a prophetic vision of America the American Christianity the American gospel that we have today she is she she is clothed in a newspaper the politics and the news of the day is what her preaching is about and what her Revelation is about it's not about the the open word it's not about the revealed scripture but it's all about news and what's in the news and what's the latest headlines in the paper and what is she doing just as her just as they have in their worship service a great Rock and Roll concert they paint their Church black because they're in they're walking in darkness so they can't help themselves they paint their Church all black like it's a like it's some kind of stage they feel they put up smoke they have all kinds of rock and roll going on they look like rock singers they act like rock singers they are rock singers and brother Branham identifies it exactly so you see what's happening we're not going to pattern ourselves after what brother Branham saw in the vision we're going to pattern herself other what the other vision is and then when them women pass by all doing all kinds of rocks and things and short hair and painted faces and as they pass by like that supposed to be virgins to Christ and when she passed by like that I turned my head you know with this holding in front of me it was a disgraceful the back of them and there they was going like that and I turned my head to weeping like that then I heard something like Onward Christian Soldiers I looked and here come that sainted bunch of little girls just exactly the way they are was all correctly dressed their hair hanging way down on their back smooth clean marching like this to the step of the Gospel she was the word it looked like one out of every nation I was looking at it as they passed by I'd seen them pass by instead of going down they started going up Hallelujah see that's that's the true bride ladies that's what you're to represent yeah see the prophet always says that you want to see the condition of the church look at the women in the church we want to be as brother Branham said just exactly the way they was correctly dressed their hair hanging down on their back now doesn't mean you can't put your hair up it's not what I'm saying but it what it's typifying is she ain't got her hair cut off she doesn't have her hair bob smooth clean she's not painted she doesn't have makeup on see that was typifying the real and genuine bride of Christ two three and five the aged women likewise that they be in Behavior as becometh holiness not false accusers not given to much wine teachers of good things that they may teach the young women to be sober to love their husbands to love their children to be discreet chaste keepers at home good obedient to their own husbands that the word of God be not blasphemed so here's Paul he's writing to a pastor he's writing to Titus and he's telling Titus this is what I want you to instruct instruct them to teach these things and instruct them also to teach the young women and it gives a list of different things of what they are to teach and what what they're saying so when we're looking at this we should look at this as the first church age Messengers instructions to sisters we don't look at this and say well that was good for another age that was good for their culture but things are different now no this is what it's teaching to us today You may wish it said teach them to go get an education and have a career I may wish they said that but it's not what the Apostle teaches it's not what he's telling them that's not the vision that he's giving them now you might go to school before you're married you might get an education those things that's up to you but as I believe as preachers of the word of God and as parents these are this is the vision that the Lord is asking us to put before our daughters he's not asking for us to put another Vision there's other things that may have to be done but that should be this should be top priority this should be our main focus if our main focus is get an education and have a career we're off the word we're not we're not teaching the right Focus this should be our Focus this which should be what our teaching and and if it's not let's get back to the word First Timothy 5 14. again the instructions of the messenger to the age the Apostle Paul the center in order of the New Testament this is instructions to a pastor he's telling them I want you this is how I want you to teach this is what I want you to set before the people I will therefore that the younger women marry bear children guide the house give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproach reproachfully that's not the advice that our culture gives us that's not the advice civilization gives us that's not the advice the devil gives to us I don't know how to make it plainer to you this is God's vision for young women and for Womanhood okay again you might have done it another way let's come back and do it God's way we don't want to give an occasion for the adversary to speak reproachfully if we don't in other words if you don't follow the directions that Paul is giving you're actually going to be giving an occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully the word there it says guide the house it speaks to rule under the obviously under the headship of the husband to rule the household to manage family Affairs this should be the teaching older sisters moms grandmas teach you teach the young ladies in your life how to manage family affairs how to lead the household how to teach the children this should be an important part of the this is Paul is writing to a local church this should be an important part of what a local church does brother Branham and choosing of the Bride says now I'm not much of this modernistic taste of women working when I seen these women with these Uniforms on riding around in the city on motorcycles as police it's a disgrace to any City that will let a woman do that see see as many men that's without work it shows the modern thinking of our city it shows the degrading we don't have to have them women out there like that they ain't got no business out there like that amen this was true and brother Branham said it and it's still true today you might not like it you might think it's not very modern it's the truth it is a disgrace to any City it's absolutely true and we don't have to have our women out there like that you say but my whole culture we have to have two incomes we have to there's no way we can afford to live and let's wait a minute wait a minute you're trying to bypass what God's word says what if your job tells you you can't come to church my job I quit you say well I can't because now wait a minute where's your faith is it in men or in God I can't afford to do this because of this okay you can't afford but you're not serving yourself right right you shouldn't be anyway you're not following your own mind or cunningly devised fables when God's word commands to do something God will provide a way to do it believe me when Amy left working at the bank and when Avery was born was it difficult yeah even I I got fired from my job right before Avery was to be born did did we ever suffer did we die We're Not Dead I had another job and she was she was a baby I had another job and the boss was telling me to lie guess what I did I quit was nothing guess what we did paid our bills ate food took care of Avery She's Not Dead what is it God if you do it God's way it's the hard way but it's the way that will lead to much of Heaven awaiting you and it's the way of blessing so you might say I can't afford it if my wife is working it'll it'll be easier some ways it might be easier in some ways it might be worse the God's way is always the best way even if it's the hard way and so it don't say we can't afford it that's not an excuse to go against what God is asking to be done foreign I have a lot more to say about that we don't have till two in the morning when God gave a man a wife he gave him the best thing he could give him outside of salvation but when when one goes to trying to take a man's place then she's about the worst thing that he could get a hold of that's right see now we can see the spiritual application I know that's bad you think it's bad but it's the truth we don't care how bad it is we got to face up to the fact that's what the Bible teaches she's got no business in a defense plan A Woman's Place is at home with her children and when she now if her husband's sick and she has to work that's different but women's place is at home in the kitchen and when she lives that leaves that she's out of her place exactly right okay that's not a very modern thing to say it's the truth this is a this is a prophet speaking it's not merely an opinion it's a prophet preaching the truth from the word of God this is what God's vision is we read it in the scripture exactly we we don't go against God's word because of culture because of society because of pressure because of demon powers I mean when I'm pre every time I preach about this what what happens I go back to my office and I sit down and I feel like I've been on in a boxing match for 15 rounds and I'm Victorious but I need a rest why is that because all hell is against this if your home's not in order if your your life is not in order your family's not in order the church is not in order and the whole thing is outside of God's blessing yes you might be making the ends meet but if you're missing what God can do and the blessing of walking by faith it's the hard way that's admittedly God says that to the brother Branham in that interpretation of tongues admittedly this is the hard way but then he turns around and says but it's my way and because of it because you've made this choice a great portion of Heaven awaits you see and that's that's a that was brother branham's promise but also that's the promise to anyone who will take God's word walk in obedience to it regardless of the circumstances regardless of anything equal men and women are equal in God's sight but they have different roles a married couple is to have Oneness he told us this for this cause shall a man lead father and mother and cleave unto his wife and the two will be one flesh so now they created a new family now they've created a new relationship husband and wife to be you to be in Oneness Oneness in physical emotional financial and spiritual matters she takes his name and all that belongs to both of them are joined together in one man is an organizing managing and deciding character he's to be the servant leader to love to protect to cherish he's the stronger vessel the woman is to submit to obey she's the weaker vessel she's under the headship of her husband but she is to manage the household affairs brother Branham calls her the Fifth Gospel she is there she's to she's to teach and instruct the children along with her husband now that brother man doesn't say that's to say the man doesn't have any role of course the man has to be very much involved First Timothy 2 9. you know what I'm going to close musicians if you come when we look at this and we look at this Society and just just trying to summarize things here we look at the society that we're living in today as the results of Satan's attack on so many different levels we see demon powers coming in through every every every spot every number one everything that we see in this world today is based upon the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil it's not the tree of life every technology that we have today what does it produce death it produces some good things some positive things and some bad things see and that that's that's everything across the board this is not God's will this is not God's program this is not God's plan God will in the Millennium and in the new Earth will have a civilization built on the word of God something completely different what it's built on today is satanic and so we see Satan's way to attack the church and to attack you and me is through this feminization this process of tearing down what it means to be a woman and what is what is the congealing result at the very end of of this process of the women saying we want our rights what's the what's the end result is that there's no such thing as a woman we don't know what that is we can't answer that question that would be uh that would be sexist to answer that question we don't know that's the result on that end the result in science what did science develop in our in our time in food what did the devil do he put a feminizing factor in everything yeah and you need you absolutely need the power of God to overcome this thing and the wisdom of God to overcome this thing then we go into the church world same results see it's all following the same progression tear down what it is means to be a woman in in in life in society in the church and why is that because there's a there's going to be a bride and I want to cloud people's minds so much they don't even know what that means anymore but thank God there's been though Satan did all this and he had his perfect terrorist strike against the world against on every every realm God came right out in front of him right at the very time that Satan brought his message to pervert Womanhood and the character of a woman what did he do he he he said Bob your hair what through Hollywood he promoted that what did he do he said wear pants through the through Hollywood and the mainstream of society what did he do say put on makeup through through that right at that very juncture in time God was dealing with a little man from Kentucky God was telling him don't ever drink or smoke or defile your body in any way for there's a work for you to do when you get older God was doing something right there to do what to for us to bring a Vindicated message to set all of these aspects in order you think well it's just to bring the the right revelation of things it's to bring the right life into you it's to bring the right kind of family is to bring the right kind of manhood the young people of today if you're the very last generation that and you're going to take the Rapture God is going to make sure Micah that you have the right kind of manhood Avery that you have the right kind of Womanhood God is going to he did that in the message you read it and you say oh my that's so contrary to everything that we see in the newspaper and everything we see that's exactly right it is thank you God that it's so contrary to the all this chaos of Babylon let's stand and pray Heavenly Father we just come before you Lord and we just wanna [Music] take a moment Lord after that sharp cutting message Lord we want to just bathe in your
