focus on the Lord Jesus and we greet each one of you and we welcome you recognizing that each one of you are very special and each one of you are very unique and you're different and you're odd all of all of us are in fact we have several hundred here tonight but we're still a minority so stop being a victim the rest of your life and just accept it you're a minority all right but we're going to heaven and we're going in the Rapture Hallelujah now uh this is a youth meeting and we're focusing on that I don't want you to worry about anything or be nervous about anything God's got it all in control we're Sons and Daughters of God and all of us are on a journey and we're at different stages of growth and experience and we respect one another and we do have patience for each one of you and we're willing to wait and linger and let God go down a pathway and leave the rest of us just for you so I'm not into meetings where we just focus on the services I'm brother John is more concerned about next Monday and your Tuesday and next Wednesday then I am just this this meeting tonight or tomorrow's meeting I'm more concerned about what you take home with you and your personal Walk With Jesus is that okay whatever you have need of I think our pastors already said that brother Jason whatever you have need of is in Jesus so I encourage you to surrender right while you're in your chair just yield yes amen just be sensitive to those around found you how many believe we're living in another book of Acts in the book of Acts people were being healed just in the shadow of someone else the the the people that really had the Holy Ghost were just walking and living their lives and just their shadow people were being healed so if you just want to wave your hand or just be a believer maybe don't make a lot of noise but just your shadow could heal someone cause Deliverance for somebody a whole section could just be filled with the Holy Ghost while they hear the word so if we are in another book of Acts don't put it all behind the pulpit please that's not where the focus is the focus is on you we're here for you this weekend is that okay so be listening for a personal word from the Lord and U be conscious that God is dealing with others and we're a body and we move together and so these are some of the greatest times of your life and this year 2021 has been a very Sovereign and Supernatural year and I don't know what would attract uh young people and people from over 20 churches to meetings other than the Holy Ghost other than God has called us together and I have seen it in other states and other churches and other moves of God where God is moving very sovereignly get caught up in the wave the virus they call another wave another wave another wave well it's time for us all to get caught up in the Rapture wave and we don't want to be Revival Surfers where we're just surfing and just looking for the next you know youth meeting but we want to be young people and Believers that are are being filled and being possessed and have something of substance that we uh you know God pre-plans everything and he pre-arranged everything so there's opportunities for us to draw closer to him this weekend and to one another amen and so uh I don't want to be negative but making fun of others will not be tolerated amen being a bully is sin so we don't I I believe it's okay to say this we we don't stand for arrogance and you know people being uh full of Pride and selfishness let's just cast that in the trash can you know this is like a hospital all right so this is a place of healing so if you have no need of a physician then you wouldn't go to the hospital you just drive on by and you never go there till there's a need so we're here because there's needs and we're willing to put our name out there and put our face out there and be vulnerable to one another am and you don't have to be embarrassed we're all trying to find ourselves none of us have it all together and none of us know it all I actually wrote these notes down can you believe that Hallelujah none of us are better or higher than anybody else we're all in need so willing to be open and be vulnerable and even this weekend that we're here brother John is a middle-aged person 49 years old but my wife is beautiful she makes up for that and she's back there in the back by uh sister Jean God bless you Sister Jean we were born and raised in the message so when you hear us speak it's it's coming from another perspective it's coming from someone that was raised with a father and a a mother that believe this message we're raised at the brandham Tabernacle for 16 years of our life we're not ashamed of our Prophet William brandham and so when we Minister I just wanted to give this as a foundation um we're ministering from from an experience of I always remember brother Jason and he remembers too our family back in the Tabernacle and I wonder what it what it was like to be a teenager growing up then but I wonder what it's like to be a teenager or a young adult growing up now and you have it 10 times worse than we ever did and brother Jason and I are middle age now now we have grandchildren and so they have it 10 times more than our children that's right and I have three children and three grandchildren and so we just want the Lord to minister to us I think the brothers can you bring up our first slide I want to show this quote before we turn to the uh Book of Joel if you want to start turning to the Book of Joel but we're going to read this quote on the screen I think you'll be able to bring that up so if I can have your attention let's let's look at this together this is our title tonight restored youth I guess I don't have your attention you're turning to the Book of Joel it's in the Old Testament back there okay let's read this an INT seed sign welcome brother Matthew come on back brother everybody's watching you when we see God heal a man a few days ago in our church he's speaking this in Georgia they brought a little girl in there on a stretcher he's talking about his home Church in brandom Tabernacle they called me into in the night time on the road and said the girl cannot live the cancer was so bad dad about 17 years old she can't even get there it was a pitiful case a lovely little child of 17 years old but to prove something to my church I never touched the girl at all I never as much as touched her I walked in she was laying on a stretcher of course there were other sick people but I was concerned about the child to catch her spirit when I spoke to her she seemed like a very fine little girl I could see no reason why that child should fill a premature grave and that has to be the devil trying to take her life so I never touched the child at all went right to the pulpit with the word and stayed right with the word and the word healed her so instantly until she got up and walked away is all right now now living like anybody else and can't find a trace of it anywhere never even touched her now remember what he said there I'm sorry I just blanked the screen I was trying to prove something to my church to prove something to my church I never touched the child at all and then the last part I never even touched her see the word went forth this is our last quote before we read the scripture the word went forth and she believed the word and the word is God's life and God's power and the word is what does it the word heals the sick then you say well Jesus healed the sick he is the word he is the word when you receive the word you receive Jesus for he is the word then he quotes the scripture the word was made flesh and dwelt among us we believe that don't we how many believe the word tonight we believe that Christ is God's word made manifest we believe that his bride must be the same thing we believe that she must believe every bit of the word and have that word in her because she is part of the body she is the body where he is the head so you are part of the body of Jesus Christ then we're going to approach you like that we're going to speak to you like that I believe that's wonderful we're Sons and Daughters of god so let's stand to our feet tonight and if you Brothers want to put the scripture up that's fine Joel chapter 2 verse 23 did you find that okay the Lord laid this on our hearts for tonight specifically I will will restore sayeth the Lord and we are a restored youth that's our title Joel chapter 2 verse 23 be glad then ye children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God so no sadness around here for he hath given you watch this verse who's speaking he hath given you the former reain moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month so in the same season at the same time the same service we could have teaching we could have God's spirit just raining and falling on someone yeah and teaching maturing planting in the same service that that's what it's come down to bethl Tabernacle and Buford South Carolina Welcome to prophecy being fulfilled you you might not realize what's happening but God is in our midst Hallelujah go into all the world and preach the gospel there's more streaming this service or we'll watch this service then is in this service so let's pull on the needs not just of young people in North America but all over the world we need to stop being a selfish generation and a me generation and an eye generation and and turn it right around and Sunday morning the Lord willing I really want to lay that in brother Jason to encourage you as as the youth and the Young Generation it's not when you get older there's a work for you to do that was the commission of our Prophet that when you get older there's a work for you to do your work for you to do is right now verse 24 and the floors shall be full of wheat bethl Tabernacle is going to be full of the word and the fat shall overflow with stimulation of Revelation and the Holy Ghost wine and oil verse 25 is our verse who speaking and I will will restore who's speaking just say it God is so God is saying I'm going to restore I'm going to bring back I'm going to revive you I'm going to give you what you have need of it's not a minister it's not a pastor or Prophet or Pope or teacher it's God coming tonight he's speaking it out of Joel It's prophecy I will restore to you the years that the Locust hath eaten the cankerworm and the caterpillar and the Palmer worm my great Army which I sent among you and ye shall eat in plenty amen and be satisfied glory to God somebody please pass some more wine and some oil we might laugh a little bit we might cry a little bit together tonight we might cry like I was during sister yon singing I was just crying I was weeping anybody else that was the presence of the Lord I speak Jesus I don't know if anybody heard me back there I was clapping shouting screaming Jesus Hallelujah he seem scream Jesus from the mountain Jesus well scream it from the pulpit scream it from the Pew it's Jesus Oh My we're going to eat in plenty this weekend and be satisfied and

your God and none else Hallelujah no King LeBron no King this King goddess none else amen and my people shall never be ashamed and it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your old men shall dream dreams and your young men shall see visions and he's not talking about televisions or movies this is a prophecy of young men caught up in the Supernatural and young ladies caught up your daughters Hallelujah maybe I'm prophesying over somebody it's time to come out of your shell and come out of your old nature and come out of Hallelujah friends we're going in the Rapture I will restore I'm speaking to restored youth verse 29 and also upon the servants and upon the handmaidens in those days will I pour out my spirit and I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth blood and fire and pillars of smoke and the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into Tri into blood before the great and terrible day of the Lord come Malachi said before the great and Dreadful day of the Lord God was going to send a prophet I will send you a Prophet Elijah he's done his work already here we Joel is speaking about these times that would come verse 32 is our last verse and it shall come to pass that whosoever ever let's all say whosoever brother brandham said put your name there whenever you see whosoever put your name there shall call on the name of the Lord shall be delivered for in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be Deliverance as the Lord hath said and in the remnant whom the Lord shall call Heavenly Father speak to us from your word tonight as we've already heard heard your Prophet speak to us Lord May out of the words that you speak to us may there come deliverance and healing there's no physical stretchers or CS or wheelchairs that I can see but I know spiritually we are in a great battle there's a great Onslaught and I pray that you'd help brother John to get out of the way oh Father May the pillar of fire come into this building May the same lamb that broke the Seven Seals come and break exactly what we need to hear tonight we're not here for a show or to please anyone but you help us to get out of the way from the front to the back let us move as a body as a unit if we get a little weary I know some have traveled for hours even today strengthen them Lord as we wipe the sweat from our brow but may our hearts be in unison one mind one Accord just be for the move of the Holy Spirit and for what you would have done Among Us May some that came to these meetings go home set free delivered ministered to I pray in Jesus Christ's name amen and they all saiden Hallelujah you going to stand up the whole service or you want to be seated I guess you can be seated amen glory to God y'all can smile tonight amen GL to God and we're looking forward to tomorrow y'all have a wonderful time tomorrow enjoying one another if it rains or Don't Rain just have a great time serving God this is Friday night the world is having a great time it's time for us to have a great time Hallelujah so let's look at this tonight on restored youth rest St youth maybe Brothers you can go to our next slide my my son-in-law my only son-in-law was at the uh Clinic a few months ago and took this photo and sent it to us it's slide number three and I just thought it's amazing look at this this is a picture at a health care clinic and they literally had a sign brother Jason saying please limit each office visit to one to two issues only in other words they don't have no time to go talking about everything going on in your life or three four five six things but I'm thankful that God has timeall the great physician now is near you won't see any of these signs around God's clinics he has the time praise the Lord hallelujah Lord they want to limit it they they want to limit the time limit just talk about your knee or your talk about your anxiety or talk about your heart but you know all the other thing you know prioritize it well God has healing for all of us tonight Soul spirit and body do we believe that together now let's go to the next slide and speak about this I will restore as it just came to me some days ago of restoration and I will restore I still got the original piece of paper that I wrote on I will restore who's saying this it's it's God it's the Lord and he has never lied that's right so I will restore to you the years that the Locust hath eaten the cankerworm the caterpillar the pommer worm this great Army which was sent out you years is a division of time or a measure of time it it's indicating part of an age or it could be even a lifetime years of life God is saying to the situation that he's there to restore I will restore even if it's a lifetime of issues even if it's things going on in your life but it's in the time in a measure of time this is our time this is our season because as a as a restored uh youth it's going to be changed at any moment this is all that we've got right now is time but eternity is blending in with time so anything in your life that's out of cater out of line in disarray the promise of God is I will restore to you say it just happened in a this like this or just became like a season of my life but this could have been going on for years God's able to restore you and I'm going to get into some pictures in a few minutes of scars you know all of us have gone through things in our lives even you as young people there's scars and we know about scars that we bear but I will restore as a promise to us as young people we've been given a message and given a word word and thus sayith the Lord that I I'm going to labor on this till we get it I will restore it he's here to restore you back to your right mind back to your senses your spiritual senses of who you really are God's going to break every chain and break every yoke and break every spirit that is haunted you and demonized you you're not a victim you're Rising you're coming out of that Hallelujah if I'm speaking above your head just reach up and grab it like an allar just reach up and grab it I'm throwing a ladder down into the pit to say we're with you but we're we're coming out of here I will restore there's got to be brothers and sisters that's been there already that knows there's power there's strength there's keeping power I'm speaking to you tonight from experience hallelujah we're not here to talk about a message we're here to get in under the token and apply it that's a quote of brother Brandon By the way we're not here to talk about the message we're here to apply the token apply the blood because the death angel is in the land sir death is in the land and it wants to destroy you and take you down it's taking down Elders it's taken down older people it's taken down people that's been preachers and song leaders and deacons and trustees but he focus is on the young people brother John has seen it even in the last 15 months and this is a youth meeting by the way so I'm going to be addressing it very strongly it Satan's intent is to destroy the young people and we know the virus and different things has taken a lot of older ones or those with pre-existing conditions that's the natural death but brother John has seen a spiritual death and a death grip even message churches and and he he puts a choke hold on the young people on the children but that's why we have meetings like this that the Holy Spirit would come TW over 20 churches Here We Are Tonight you have a little room but tomorrow night it's going to be full so just breathe a little bit Satan's trying to put all of his demons on you so you can't breathe that's why Jesus speaking to his disciples just a few days before he left he breathed on them it was a promise receive ye the Holy Ghost and just a few days later they went up to the day of Pentecost and they received it so all the years that Satan has indicated it's a measure just look at your whole life Satan's trying to say you're no good you're not going to make it in the Rapture you don't have the Holy Ghost you'll never measure up and here's a promise saying I will restore to you the years amen so in the next slide I guess I thank you Brothers maybe that's that's better I just took it out of a couple different versions We read out of the King James ver version and The New International Version in Joel 2:25 says I will repay to you I will repay you for the years the locusts have eaten yes amen he's not talking about CIA locuses and they Buzz around every 17 years [Music] and he's talking about spirits that haunt you not just your waking days but even in your sleep he'll try to take away your sleep and get you to where you're so full of nervousness you can't sleep that's a demon Spirit God God's trying to give you rest he's trying to give you peace Hallelujah I felt this brother Jason and sister Debbie as we spoke last night at the table I was almost weeping looking across and hearing the testimony I thought God if some of our older ones can be going through these battles what about our young people then we are here to fight for you we are here to fight for our young people to make it every single one of them we're here to get out of the way and lay down and become vulnerable and become like foolishness before you so that you would win Christ so that a young lady or a young man could look beyond the scars and look beyond the wounds and Touch the Hem of His Garment say there is hope for me I will repay or give back to you the years that the locusts have eaten the great Locust and the young Locust the other Locust that swarm The New American Standard Version says it like this Joel 2:25 then I will make up to you see I always feel like I'm falling short I always feel like that I'm not making the grade I you know we can be guilty as adults by speaking down all the time to our young people or our children or our grandchildren or any children and we we can almost get a condescending attitude I've been there I done that we know the quotes we've been that's not what young people need Amen brother brandham said our children have it 10 times worse than we did so our grandchildren have it I think a hundred times then right CU if one generation 10 times is it a 100 times come on so there ought to be no condescending and looking down there ought to be Lord what can we do for our young people what can our grandchildren how can we get out of the way you say well we've been there we' done that but you haven't been down their Road I've got to commend all of you God has chosen you to be in a generation I I was thinking I was going to say I don't know how you're doing it or how you're making it but I do know it's the same strength that we had but we never want to get to a place as older ones that we're just above everybody I salute you Satan is tormenting your mind with pressures I never had there were things that we were dealing with that it seemed like it was 18 or 19 when our minds and our emotions were older that an 8-year-old deals with now a 9-year-old a one-year-old knows how to swipe I know what I'm talking about I I prayed for a little boy this is years ago and he was a little boy he's not even one years old and he already swiping D and he had a heart problem and his parents had him in the hospital and he was already learning he knows how to swipe push p and friends you know incredible if you hello you're incredible like yeah if you if you want to get something done with the electronic just hand it to a young person let's move along here Joel is saying I will make up to you for the years that the swarming locusts have eaten sir the creeping Locust the stripping Locust and the gnawing Locust can we just say any spirit that would come against this generation we have been given Authority by the word of God to say I will restore we're looking at it straight in the faceall to Satan tonight and saying you are coming down not the person but a spirit that would defy the word of God that brother brandham said to prove something to my church I never touched the child at all so he wasn't interested in just doing f Fantastics he wasn't being he wasn't personally trying to please the pastors or the ministers I'm not speaking to them tonight I'm speaking to you as young people it's God proving his word that you can touch God and he can touch you right there and no one needs to know about the issue but God and he just touches you and it's over do we believe that together now our next slide and I'm not boring you I hope I'm just speaking about some things about I will restore and when I heard that it was like boom that's the first service that's Friday night somebody's here that needs to hear that God speaking to you three words I will restore I am restoring it just nudge your neighbor and say God's restoring say don't touch me I said don't touch me well Hallelujah just speak the word brother amen hallel smile a little bit Hallelujah Lord prise God you're already accepted so none of our sisters need to wear makeup or eyes Shadow or do with it we all think you're [Applause] beautiful Hallelujah you don't have to wear earrings split skirts high heels to please none of the brothers that's single come on I'm preaching ladies you to be going yes yes you know I'm just I just set everybody free all the sisters are free brother they don't have to try to be something tomorrow you don't have to be the rock crawler that gets to the top and smash somebody on the volleyball and hit the home run like that's wonderful but we're looking for daughters of God and sons of God amen none of that was in my notes that was just all free but it's good for the Sisters to know brother you're not looking for a bunch of stuff you're looking for God I will restore is all the virtues yes all the godliness all the character some of you are smiling I think you know what I'm talking about I will restore is a generation of young people that they know who they are and they don't need a lot of Fant Fantastics they don't need the Internet and somebody putting up a bunch of likes they've already been accepted in the Beloved you know we're not taking any vote tonight about the message the message is true no matter what you think we're just telling the world the message is true and we don't need 648 likes and then 100 downs and oh I believe it no God said it I will restore it doesn't matter if there's a thousand thumbs down by the end of the service dislikes we believe the word of God I so when he said restore that means I'm going to give you a covenant of Peace probably we ought to preach a whole message on this but we only have three with you this weekend God is giving you peace I give it to you so if you're battling and Waring just receive it you know you can get like this and God just asking everyone to go like this just let it go I told you I'm going to speak personal I'm going to talk right it doesn't matter if I get no amens no hand claps I'm just going to preach the word and some of us live like this right I'm speaking to your young people we just need to go like this we just need to let it go could be 13 years old tonight that's and 16 or 17 or 23 or 83 but it's a secret Just Let It Go amen and your mind can be going in a lot of places but God's talking to you right now and the Holy Spirit is getting your attention and it might take a little bit of time or half a service or till tomorrow night for somebody but just keep fighting keep waiting through just keep laying aside your feelings and your emotion all the years that the Locust has tried to crowd in and Claw away at your integrity and your beauty and all the false images that Hollywood and Paris has built up in your minds to be and Larry Bird said it the best one of the all stars at the end he just I think he threw the ball against the locker and he said is this all there is to life is a stinking locker room that's one of the elite and so it's not King LeBron it's not King that it's King Jesus it's God changing our mind changing our whole restoration has to do with God putting you at peace so you can receive the word because you'll become the word as you receive the word amen so if there's a wall and and there's a reason why you can't receive it that's the devil that's not the Holy Spirit I didn't say you didn't have the Holy Spirit I said yield to the holy spirit let the Holy Spirit break down all the Clutter I tell you tonight we need more of God in our lives than ever you say well I'm battling whether I even have the Holy Ghost tonight why don't you just end that right now I don't know if you have it or not right I really don't but God can give you the experience and the faith tonight to receive it every single person in this building could receive the Holy Ghost right now so it's you just need to stop wrestling do I have it did I get it a year ago was that really real just stop all that nonsense God isn't going to come back until you're ready to go amen y'all remember what Jesus said two in a bed one will be taken one be left do y all remember that that's the Bible Luke 17 two in a bed stop thinking you're always the one that's going to be left you know I'm the Judas in the church I I I'm brother John if you knew my private life well God knows about your private life and he's still talking to you this [Applause] wayl he'll bring a man from Washington State which is where I live all the way to South Carolina for God to touch your heart just in a certain word or a certain atmosphere and you just feel [Music] that some of us just need to learn to breathe again just look around the room and realize wow God's put me here for a purpose everything's pre-planned brother Jason God knew tonight he knew where everyone would be sitting every person and every mile the wheels turned or every however you got here God saw you some of you are really nervous tonight I understand that most of us are nervous God made us as his seed to be inspirational can I just go down this for a little bit he made us inspirational so that's why many times you and I can be like this it's not that we haven't been born again and that we don't have the Holy Ghost it means that God calls Believers that are inspirational and have a seed down inside of them and you never fit into this world never you'll never fit in to the world and you can get anxious and upset and try to fit in you're not going to fit in this should be the place we can let off the pressure and feel at home that's why I asked you in the beginning we need to respect one another the only person that should be nervous after these meetings is the devil that nervous Spirit starts working and feeding off of someone else well just throw up your hands and say devil I'm going to be delivered this weekend is my time for peace I I will restore my mind has been scattered broken I feel like it's being pulled apart I will restore is a promise of God like a lightning bow so it means that God is going to make you complete I'm just in the second line there and to be sound I've given you a sound mind I'm here to make your life complete to be I'm going to finish this work I'm going to cause you to be ended and come to the end uninjured Hallelujah now that's kind of strange because you say well brother John I'm tattered I'm broken I've been injured I've been shot at I've been in a fight and the sword is got me I'm going to talk about that in a few minutes I'm going to show you on the screen what scars are but to be uninjured is not does not mean that when the Rapture happens that our spirits and our bodies aren't going to have some difficulties people that are older finally realize that our bodies we need a change and when we're younger we think we're Invincible we can take on the world well as you get a little older if there becomes trauma in your life you realize we need the Lord we need the Lord even if you're healthy and strong we need the Lord why don't you just say it I need the Lord need the Lord say but I got it together that's a problem you'll never be helped unless you realize I need more of the Lord there's there's more of me I can you say but I've got the Holy Ghost and you ought to be pulling harder you ought to be pulling saying God fill us all [Music] Lord we're a team amen I don't believe in Superstar preachers in the message and oneman Ministries where they take over and it's just all watching the preacher I don't believe in that I'm putting it back on you tonight I want you to receive I want you to be sound this is God saying this I want you to be complete I'm going to finish the work I'm going to end this and and you're going to be uninjured you're going to make it when the role is Called Up Yonder you're going to be there your soul is perfect nothing's out of cater these are all quotes and scriptures I'm just I'm just speaking the word tonight and some girl on a stretcher is coming out of there and I might not never know I don't need to know but just take your stretcher and walk out throw the stretcher out in the street and praise God somebody else will pick it up some homeless person that needs it they'll be sleeping in it and you'll Dy that's my stretcher but praise God and Hallelujah throw away your crutches and the woe is me you know it's amazing every person can be under a spirit of condemnation and depression and everybody just looking how's my friend doing how's my f is my friend responding is my friend responding you know is my friend just respond to the word you know we get like this all right right you know I can just imagine somebody walking in here with a million dollars and saying I got a million dollars for and say your name you think you'd be going yeah you'd say that's me here I am are you serious I I know we're raised in a generation of fake news and even if they came in here with a wheelbarrow of a $100 bills by tomorrow that could be worth zero it's true friend right during this service the whole economy of America could be collapsing there could be already bombs going off to Israel there could already be resurrected Saints coming down the road to walk in here [Applause] hallelujah so it it is God Awakening our desire yes I mean where would you rather be down at a pub somewhere having sex with someone outside of marriage and don't worry not just young people and not just middleaged but in the message so don't think that it's all this and that and holier than thou on there'll be a huge crash for you one day cuz God's going to restore you no matter what and until your stubborn stiff neck mind and heart gets broken so why not just let it be broken amongst people that love you that's right instead of being a broken heart to someone that's just going to throw you in the corner anyway and you're just another number I pray if someone has been going down that road brother Matthew that maybe all of this was to save a lot of Despair and ruin amen and if it has happened in your life that's not the unpardonable sin hello we all know what the unpardonable sin is right it's blasphemy against the Holy Ghost so if you feel an urge up to just say something just and whatever you've done in your life and I don't know who the holy spirit's talking to right now but it's not the unpardonable sin it's time to commit that to God and put it under the blood and let's go on stop holding that inside or you'll go [Applause] crazy God is going to make you safe to make you whole and good again look at this this is is there anything good or whole that can come out of this situation the word says there is I will restore is to make compensation I'm going to make good on where you're falling short I'm going to pay the difference my goodness I'm yes I'm 34 cents short what am I going to do don't worry there's somebody else in line that I I'll take that I'm $484 I'm $1,000 as you get older it just gets I'm 24,000 I'm Amen brother but tonight I'm talking spiritually he paid the debt there's no one in this building I I challenge you to defy the Holy Spirit to say your situation is so special and unique that God can't take care of that come on he's already taken care of it Hallelujah you just need to own up you just need to be honest you know what we're doing tonight we're Fanning the Flames away some away from somebody yeah amen somebody that's being burnt they're going walking through the fire and we're Fanning away the Flames saying come out of there come out of there there's a fourth man showing up tonight to you that'll stand and give your we read it in Joel whosoever so call upon on the name of the Lord shall be destroyed is you're going to barely you're you're going to miss it right at the very end you're going to miss it you know when the role is Called Up Yonder where're so and so she didn't make it the world swallowed her up not you you already got a name tag there with your name I will restore sayth the Lord so if you don't have the joy you need he's paying the he's paying it for you just walk out of the store well I'm unworthy I'm undeserving I don't even know that person they don't know me well I'm just paying it I used to work in a grocery store I managed grocery store store I know what people get great big shopping carts and meat and produce and they spend an hour hour and a half walking they got screaming kids and and they come up my purse my what what are you going to do it's $234 187 you know and then you see these carts pushed into the back room you know they got meat and produce and everything they didn't have money they didn't have the goods decline decline oh no I know there's money on there they didn't have it do you know what that's what we're having today is people in the message it's coming up you just don't have it you don't have the goods we we can talk about it we can sing about it we can preach about it but it really comes down to do we have it and I this weekend I want you to reach beyond the crowd and grab something and take it home so Monday night Monday night you're not wishing it was Friday night again or wishing that you had another couple hundred Believers singing and shouting and we can do that no but when you're all alone that you can sense that presence of another person but I feel right now when you're in your torment you've been given an a script bag something's been put in your pocket you remember what was said you remember it's been able to be brought back to your memory cuz it's the word of God I will restore is this helping anyone tonight it's it's the word it's the wordl God is paying the debt he's rewarding and Performing he's making an end of all this now as we move to the next slide I want everyone to see this as we move to the next slide I think my brothers most of you have seen this before but if you cut a tree you can see the rings of a tree it show the years of the life of a tree but there's also events that happen within a life or a season and and you know brother Brandon preached the message the brid tree have you ever heard that restoration of the brid tree what I wanted you to see is right in the beginning in the middle is the first year then you can see in a rainy season the lines actually get wider that's because there's more growth then the years that it was drier maybe like the last few months in the message you know you couldn't go to church or this with cancelling meetings you got a stream can't go to Young peoples can't go to camp and it's like you're gasping it's like a dry season yeah but what I wanted you to see here is the scar from a forest fire can you see that can you see that brother Jason at this certain year of this tree's life there was a forest fire that went through the church or the family yeah or school or a relationship it was like a forest fire and it burned you could see the effects that it had next slide thank you brothers that are helping me back there now the wood of this tree oh you can see it's 24 years old 24 years and you can see the different years of its life but there's a knot there can you see that on the bottom part of the that knot lasted for five years w wow there was a situation that happened and it it actually whether it grew around another sapling something happened it it it became a knot in the believer's life you can see that it lasted for five years I just want you all to know that not every tree is perfect amen not every believer is perfect we know spiritually our souls and we you know we're already there Heavenly places we can quote that all day long but we have people sitting in the pews that are wondering why the scars why the forest fires well I'm I'm speaking to you tonight there's knots in our lives there's situations that no matter how good it might be it comes around to that and it hits the situation I'm speaking about some of your lives next slide now this certain tree is about 30 years old it was cut when it was 30 years old it's Douglas fur tree but when it was 20 years old you can see for 20 years throughout its whole adolescent teenage years Etc the tree how it was so the lines are very very little can you all see that it was lean years it was dry they weren't in a church that was strong they they were out in the world or they came to the Lord when they were 20 years old but there came a certain time time they're calling it bio solids but certain things started being poured into this tree's life growth uh water care compassion amen God brought a young person into that or a youth leader into that church maybe like brother Wes Willis yeah or he brought a certain Minister by that certain year at Youth Camp or these special meetings and something caught your heart and from that time you've never never been the same or you came from the world and now you finally found yourself then you you think everybody in the church is going to be excited on fire and passionate for the Lord and you find out there's things that go on in certain situations you say my goodness we had that in the world and we're supposed to be in the message and how can they do that and well friends don't don't think you just go right on serving God we don't want a religious spirit around bethl Tabernacle this year I don't care where you were born or who your pastor is we all need more of God even the older ones that drove you here your parents or your pastor I'll just be take it we all need the Lord right sister Phillips you're gonna sing this weekend don't say no you got to say yes to Brother John so watch this when something is poured into your life you start to grow I'm from the Pacific Northwest so this is very familiar to me it increases their growth and and it's and you start to grow from the that something's been added to the soil around the tree that's why I believe in

nothing's going to move me come on brother preach it I was just in Dallas preached a weekend there is one wonderful and there was a a man sitting right back there I won't Point anywhere but and he wouldn't smile the whole service I finally said I'm not closing until you smile and he smiled I said praise God close my I said I've been working all service we're not at a funeral we're on Friday night young peoples I'm around people that are passionate and love the Lord if you just get a little tired just take a little rest and come back again I mean wipe the sweat off it is 80 in here 82 some of you finally woke up and you started burning you just went up two degrees it's like Lord send the rain I'm not being funny I'm being real I want 2021 for all of you to be a year where where your rings can be widened God's digging around the tree he's around the tree I don't know why we're still here either but maybe it's for somebody to need to be shaved I don't know why that there the Lord has delayed like his coming we all thought I mean my father and mother didn't even think their children would go to school right didn't think they would graduate never thought they'd get married amen and now it's 2021 some of you weren't even born and some of you would have know you weren't thought of outside of God thought of you and he's allowed everyone to toil and labor and go through a whole Global pandemic because his word says I will restore I'm sorry if I said that word but I'm just getting your attention whatever we've gone through is for God to prove himself in your life awaken Jesus Jus that's in your [Applause] boat let's let's go to the next slide I wanted to show this tree but I wanted to bring your attention back to the fire the scar this Wildfire happened in a situation that was unplanned this tree did not call for it and it didn't ask for it but there came a wildfire a situation happened in the church in your family yes in a relationship and you didn't ask for it and look how long it lasted look at this I'm showing you on the screen how many years it affected this tree and even in the middle part of its life can y'all see that whenever it comes around to November November why is it November because this happened brother Matthew I could sit down and talk to you about it I could tell you the details like it's just so real in my mind it's a scar yeah and someone else is looking at you saying just get over it come on well the guy walked out of your life and he said crude mean things just get over it well it could be like this and everyone else is saying well why isn't she doing okay wh why isn't that brother it just seems like he just hit a certain point then and now he's just the fire's gone yeah that's right it it was a it was a scar and you can see how the wide Rings indicate there was fast growth that year the weather was good water was available things were good life is good it's not always good come on there's going to be scars there's going to be wildfires am I breaking some of your romance novels it's not all going to be good they're not going to treat you always good life isn't fair that's right hello somebody I got about half of you with me life isn't always good God is good I'm just speaking the word God is good all the time but what happens to you isn't always good but it will work out for your good some of you know the scripture better than I do it's in Romans somewhere amen I've been preaching to you quotes of brother brandom almost word for word and scriptures and then the narrow Rings it indicates slow growth that means there was either a regional drought or cold temperatures hit and there's just not a lot of growth but all of a sudden January 2021 hit and I started hearing a Revival the move of God young people's meetings groups coming together churches it was like we hit another level it was like God was saying I've about had enough of the lethargy coldness staying at of church fist bumping waving give me a hand you know it's like I've got to come down and I've got to fulfill my word somebody know what I'm going to say I will restore amen has been laying there all these years but there has to come a time that the book is handed to him you know the pages are stuck together that even a prophet had to hear from a Catholic priest and have his Bible given to him it wasn't the Bible it was the word this day this scripture is fulfilled wake up tonight maybe somebody on the Internet is catching this more than we are in this building prophecies being fulfilled this is none less than thus sayith the Lord if brother Brandon was preaching behind this Pulpit he'd be preaching like this cuz this is how he preached it wasn't a lesson of of just you know discour he was connecting he would go a whole service and you just say you know there's been a spirit on this side has been fellowshipping with somebody back there yeah but I see now light going and there's light if God would open your eyes to the angels that line these walls can't you see that streak that's going from brother Matthew back there in the back and the deacons someone's leaning forward sister Gan is leaning forward saying God this is what we've been praying for somebody on the internet was already in this service had said I sense the atmosphere I sense the anointing they're not even in this room wow wow it's because we are fulfilling what a prophet said there would be voices and colors excuse me Brothers social distancing I'm sorry there would be voices and colors going through a room in Australia from this from that tonight we're going to Pakistan indiaan Africa right now this very moment someone in Africa is saying Amen Brother John yes brother John preach it this is what we need God help us to be right in the midst of it and not even know that prophecies being fulfilled this day God is restoring Minds restoring Hearts restoring you from the scars and the years the years the next slide I just put it on the screen here as we come toward the end of the service Psalms 107:20 he sent his word and healed them so he's not talking about just one here one there we had a nice meeting by the Cadre is kind of nice 200 plus young people but it was and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost they were within one mind and one Accord God send his word and healed them let's all say them it's for me it's for us till we all come to the same measure the statute of maturity then we can all go [Applause] home he sent his word and healed them and delivered them from there can we all say it what Satan thought for evil Peter Satan wanted to sift you like wheat like sand like brother Jason putting a bunch of sand in my hand like this it would just come out and just fall out Satan wanted to sift you like that let you fall to the ground and here's a word he said his word and healed them and delivered them from their destructions I just want to stop right now and say praise the Lord prise the Lord thank you Jesus you Jesus Hallelujah some of you just need to confess it and say I am healed I am delivered I I am whole I I have peace I have peace I have joy I have joy hallelujah hallelujah in the upper room they were thanking God for something they didn't even have yet that's what a prophet said just put it in your computer they were thanking God for something they didn't have yet called the Holy Ghost day one day two day three it was given to 500 and we got down to 120 yeah finally we could all get under one mind and one Accord what do you all think well we need the power alls I know is I can't be the same guy I was 50 days ago I can't be a cursing swearing preacher with a great revelation of Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God it's not going to get you in a Rapture say I know who brother Bram was and I th those are great Revelations yeah but we must have our Pentecost every single one of us have got to break through all the unbelief and all the crowd we're not a it's not a groupy thing here is not a groupy thing it's all of us getting out of the way all reaching up through the crowd saying oh Jesus oh God heal me touch me make me healthy this is of God our healer The Physician healing us of hurts of national things that would even go on in America and I know this might sound political but I'm going to say it spiritually all lives matter stop all the nonsense it's not the color of your skin or your language don't bring politics in the message this is a revelation of I will restore it's unto you and your children to all those that are far off just look up what brother brandham said about that it's the Jews the Gentiles and from all different countries they were different skinned in the upper room they came busting out of there with the Holy Ghost Hallelujah you know we've got it too good here in America even coming here tonight I told my wife like we have air conditioning things and it is still a lot cooler in here than in Africa I've preached in Africa I know what I'm talking about and the young people in Poland or in Europe they come in meetings like this they're just like this would be like a feast amen this would be like once in a year fivey year event it's like wow look around the room there's other believers one young lady I talked to she was the only young person she had driven all the way across po she said I'm the only young person in my group I'm the only one I said sister It won't always be like this it won't always be like this and to find out some months later she became married to one of the leading young people young brothers that was witnessing and on fire for God and she married that young man and they had children brother Jason brother Matthew and I just thought How great is our God and I get pictures of their wedding and of their children and and often I get it from from their youth group and others and she's there now married singing God God held her they asked brother brandom you know did you keep your religion throughout all of this you lost your wife you lost your daughter you had a lot of hurts you had a lot of scars there was a wildfire just blasted through his family would have took down a lot of people he's warming the bottle for brother Billy Paul under his arms and Billy Paul's looking up into the sky and he's saying is my mommy up there is my mommy up there he's trying to be a friend to Billy Paul I understand these things we ought to try to understand one another more have a little bit more brotherly kindness I don't care if it's the last 10 minutes on Sunday is for you you ought to have enough maturity to wait it out with us bear the load with us us I'm going to close in a few minutes but bear the load get under the Yoke the Bible says it's good for you to Bear the Yoke in your youth they go for four hours in Congo yeah you know why cuz they've walked two hours walked 3 hours 10 hours to get to the meeting they don't want an hour service that's right they don't want a 2hour service right it's like they're holding on to it they breathe cuz they know when they go go back home they don't have social media and Facebook and bl and Instagram and everybody's talking about this and that and how was it it's like we're comparing now all the Gatherings you know and what was great you know friend this is great to brothers and sisters together in unity is great somebody please pass me a little more wine please a little bit more oil let let the word be great here it Bethel Tabernacle Hallelujah God sent his word and healed them of hurt and it means liter not figuratively brother Jason don't don't just put a PowerPoint up here that says I will restore sayth the Lord and then I will heal you literally and then well it's just figuratively you know he he just meant that figuratively come on are you serious it's literal [Applause] of national hurts individual defects just get in line Hallelujah just get in line you say my good if we' passed out 50 prayer cards tonight and we're going to have those come up here you know and and you had got a card you'd say yes I got a card if you in brother branham's meetings he might only called 10 cards the Holy Spirit and you brother back there and you vex to him and you three young men over there I've saw during the Serv you by the wall there with your head down and you there with your and he would just go right down and and pretty soon the Holy Spirit would just move in the meeting he' just go right back over here to oh I see you there the second sister there uh by by the wall there and God sees you with your hand up like that with the ring on your finger God knows what you're thinking what you thought this afternoon and then it would be so so milky in there he'd say why why don't you all just stand to your feet and receive it so it's not a prayer card it's not you writing down on a little piece of paper what what you've been troubled with and not one or two things but three or four or 10 and brother John don't really know me and God just starts coming and and it's like wow that's the holy spirit this is our first service I would just said get in get in line to be healed am just get in line and so I'm I'm just going to take over this brother tomorrow night I going to show you this one year ago one year ago in June brother John went by this place and it's in Bellingham Washington it's actually my father and mother's wedding anniversary on June the 16th that's next week and we went across to an Olive Garden across this parking lot and I saw the wound healing Center and something jumped into my heart for the young people of the message this is amazing the world can have a wound healing Center for Natural Things why isn't there someone dealing with the wounds amongst our young people in the message that are real why isn't someone dealing with the wounds and again have you just drive by this like sister Anna hope and all the ones from our area that are in they've driven by this road they've been in this Clinic my daughter-in-law is an RN and she took someone to this very facility it's the wound healing Center tomorrow night I'm going to speak about I looked across brother Jason and saw this place something triggered in my heart about the young people the message why cannot they be healed amen on and I'm not going to stay on these long because some of you might faint but these are wounds let's watch the screen for a moment I hope this is going on the internet these are people I'm happy it's going on the internet these are wounds why do young people have it in their feet and their hands why on a finger you can see on the left hand side of your screen the stages of a wound how it's bloody and it's all inflamed and then as time goes on God does a healing you can see on the top one on someone's shoulder it it was like Satan was wanting to take them out it's a wound you can see here it creates a scar and this is what I want to leave you with I want you to think about this to till tomorrow night a scar is evidence that healing has taken place so stop talking about all the negative and you know reaching under your blouse or your shirt and scabby and that that's what I'm trying to put some oil on and bomm on some of you the scar may be there till the Rapture amen stop talking about the scar we all have scars but when you see a scar it's evidence that healing has taken place prise God it's actually a visible or emotional response from a past injury that did not lead to death you're still alive we didn't have your [Applause] funeral somebody say hallelujah hallelujah you'll still here maybe half here maybe not emotionally I'm getting you there come on by the end of Sunday when you go home where you drive out of here fly out of here whatever I I believe God is going to do healing and we believe in miracles but miracles happen suddenly was healing takes time and God does both of them and you always we always want Miracles we always want immediate we always want I got to get out of here I got to know the reason now I want and God just standing back there saying I'm the Healer the healers in the house the great Physicians here and we all got our placards you know miracle miracle miracle who wants a miracle yeah miracle and God's saying nope you're going to get a healing it's called a big fat lip and it's Tuesday after the special meetings and you're wondering why I've got a scar why is it black around it why do I keep dealing with this I guess I didn't get it I guess you know it just wasn't real for me and then listen I know what I'm talking about oh yeah cuz I've streamed Services of the Wednesday night after and it's like the same ones let's all bow our heads and we bow who would desire the Holy Ghost and it's the same ones and they've been at meeting after meeting after meeting it's like seriously seriously so are we either missing it or is is God trying to teach us there's scars there's things we're going through God's working he's growing and I know we're being streamed and I know somebody will go back and they'll listen and make sure brother I know exactly what I'm saying cuz I'm a doctor amen I'm a certain physician yes and I only have grade 12 education I barely made it through that but so I'm not talking about that kind of a doctor it's a gift God put in our lives to speak to you in a certain way so that some of you will walk out of here and say praise God God's helping me through this time yes I had a wound Satan thought he had me look at this and you carried around the rest of your life look at there like a sword I'm going to take you out and it becomes a scar which is really evidence this is on the bottom part that something happened in the past but did not take your life amen come on Amen but God got your attention right you think about it a lot you wonder why it comes around to November there and here you've been thinking all the all along about throwing in the towel and God's just telling you we all have scars we all have November 16th and March 24th at 12:35 do you know what happened to me I'll show you my journal I won't show you my journal never look in a girl's Journal shame on you you know it's it's private is that right do we have journals okay girls phones don't look anyway so I want you to see tonight I want you to think about this some of you have scars in your life and I'm not going to stay on this very long because I will lose some of you but on the leftand side you can see where a burn happened can you all see that you say it's bad it's horrible so is spiritual things horrible that is absolutely horrible that someone in the message said that to you yeah it's inappropriate it was out a line and they totally missed it when brother Bram say misapply misquote misplace there's a lot of Elders older people and even parents or people in the church shame on them shame on me oh yes amen shame on me if I've said something to hurt even the least of God's children it would rather a millstone was hung around my neck and thrown into the ocean out here off a Sandy Beach there is a Sandy Beach out there is that right we were out there the other day I got my haircut by Jim right right down the road I heard about all the local gossip not from Jim Jim's a good guy it was the other woman that brought her little boy and the guy that walked in blah blah blah blah blah somebody got murdered and two people got murdered I'm like wow I'm hearing all the drama and they were rich and this and then the Marine that died blah blah blah blah blah and sure enough walk into the motel grab the newspaper front page somebody got sh two people shot another Marine died and oh they thought it was this thought it was that just go to the barber shop I got all the news now Jim's a good guy he just said mhm here's the lady and here's the old anyway let's go along here we're trying to close before 11 I want you to see I want you to see I want you to see yeah how real this is to someone say well just think positive just you know count to 10 we we're not psychologists we're Believers burns happen to people and after four months or 120 days can y'all see on the right hand side of the screen the scar can you all see that it's shiny it's not like the other parts of the skin the hairs around it are different that's a scar and that person will have it the rest of their life amen my my my son Michael he had one of those hoodies on and he crawled under a truck and uh it was a dump truck loader truck and you all know the things that turn what's it called that thing that turns yeah and it was going going going going like this and he went under there to fix something and that grabbed the hoodie and just spun him around and he remembers he remembers cuz y'all know how like wraps up your shirt and he remembers looking across and saying is this how it all ends and God in his Mercy allowed it to just tear down the middle and he just dropped out of there and he goes rushing you tell me what I was at a coffee shop and to get a call and go rushing down the road like and then in the emergency room and they're taking it they don't know if his neck's broken they but he has a scar are today that'll be there the rest of his life you can cover it over you can wear a nice blouse no one might not know about it but it's there oh yeah amen right and you can see how it's something that happened it was like an injury but it didn't take your life it happened in the past and it didn't take your life life and I want you to tonight maybe the Lord would deal with your heart to just at least begin to acknowledge these things and when I looked across the parking lot and I saw the wound healing Center and then the inspiration of the Holy Spirit later months later brother Matthew begin to deal with us after we spoke on this to the young people he said it's time to leave the wound healing Center you can't live there the rest of your

I am child God we're just going to sing in a moment the great physician now is near but I wonder if the brothers could bring up the first slide again I wanted you to see this before I turn the service back to our brothers on the very first slide I wanted you to see what brother Brandon was trying to teach us tonight about a young lady that was 17 years old old going to die it was pitiful case but he said to prove something to my church I never touched the child at all so here's a prophet trying to train a church this was a man that was coming into his maturity that God Allowed by a message to be waved over a generation saying there's more out there that's going to come and he wanted them to get it he wanted them to get it and so he was just laying back and he had character and he just was wanting something for his church he never like touched her never called her never pointed laid hand never let he was just trying to train the church I walked in she's laying on a stretcher there was a lot of other sick people but he was concerned he was concerned about her to catch her spirit and I prayed in my room this afternoon that the Lord would go out and catch some wondering spirits and bring them back again only the Holy Spirit can do that and go out and catch them and bring them back again right so they can breathe and be thinking right and he's trying to get a church and he's just W concerned catching her spirit very fine girl the devil was trying to take her life never touched her went right to the pulpit preached the word stayed with the word and God healed her instantly she got up and walked out of that place never even touched heren and the next slide we read that it's it's now the body he is the head do you all see that at the end we believe every word of God we believe that Christ is in God's word he manifested it but there's a bride there's going to be a group of young people that are saying I am restored and when the call goes out where are the youth that are restored we can wave our flag say where's the Revival in the message it's not in Jeffersonville Tucson here I am here I am they were looking for the Welsh Revival they went over to you know that you all know that you've heard it for years where are the young people in the message and they they ask where is the Welsh Revival to a policeman yeah and he didn't say just go down this Street turn left turn right go to these special meetings be there at 7:00 tonight 6:00 maybe tomorrow maybe 7 we make it 7 or what and just you know just be there and that's that is the Welsh Revival no this

you got to go here you got to stream this you got to listen to this you know at this certain time on friends that's not rapturing Faith it's already in you you're becoming the word young people as you receive the word so when when we ask where is the Revival you might be in the pit of despair you might seem like you're defeated you might seem like there's a Goliath but you've just got your hands down in your script bag and there's been some Stones put in there you only need one you only need one quote you only need one scripture well why was there five I don't know but we needed Grace we needed faith we needed Jesus but you just need one to take your Goliath down I already see him down I already see some of you saying where's his swore I'm just going to cut off his head man this is a heavy sword this is a big sword it's to cut off his head it's a big demon Locust for years has told you this that and the other and tonight you've heard a message saying I will restore and you're saying that's me you take the word you just receive that now whatever happens tomorrow if it rains or don't rain and you're the front at the very top and you're like yes yes I expect that in the service tomorrow night and when someone hits a home run and everybody's cheering and that don't let that team or whoever gets the prize better Matthew you be watching that they're not all so tired out

looking at your cell phone you wonder why you can't sleep midnight 1 2 3 cuz you're looking at a device the world already knows turn it off don't let the world know more than in in these areas we're talking about and and you see young people being destroyed and people in the world can say it's this that and the other we ought to have more than the world it's just a little word it's an encouragement it's God's power it's just like that's right and it's like our eyes come open he's like from that night I've never been the same amen God just took that Spirit off of me and I know now everything's going to be okay and I can see that was a few months ago or a year ago and I see you later I've talked to people and they say brother John I'm a totally different personl since you prayed

know I won't even give the whole testimony brother John but you know there's been a lot of prayer a lot of moms lots of dads lots of young people lots of the church praying amen lots of burdens and and just needs crying out to God even coming before the expectation of this meeting knowing that there'd be young people gathered seeing the registrations come in and and uh knowing our own local young people and the needs of Upon Our in the hearts and the lives of my own children your children all of us every single one of us here have needs we all came here amen with something different I believe specific I believe the Holy Spirit was dealing and speaking and is still dealing with hearts amen right now at this very moment I don't want you to miss it you know I I sat back there and and just I I wept there for just a minute when brother John started preaching because it was just a month maybe a month and a half ago my wife uh and she's listening she's going to hear this and I know she was thinking the exact same thing my wife had went through I woke up uh one morning went through the house and she had written plastered it everywhere on every window every screen uh every door got in the shower there it is on a note right above the shower I will restore wow wrote that through our entire house and she said I don't know why she said I just I the Lord just spoke this to me and she said I'm positive this is God this wasn't just an inspirational something that you get as scripture comes upon your heart she said this is like prophetic that the Lord was speaking and saying I will restore and you know in the middle of a lot of lot of just a middle of a lot of fighting a lot of Waring a lot of battling all of us every single one of us like Brother John was preaching on you know going through that Forest that forest fire maybe a storm maybe something unexpected life was going good and then suddenly something and you just come upon it and you know right in the middle of all of that she said I don't know why I just I this this and for it's still there in my house still there on every screen uh on every window and every almost in every door I will restore written everywhere all over the mirror just everywhere she could write so that everywhere we went through the house we'd see those words I will restore I will restore we were praying for this meeting and God put brother John Andes on my heart supernaturally just out of God just dropped it in my heart was driving in my truck went to man remember exactly where it was at made a left hand turn right by Chick-fil-A and the Holy Spirit came in the room and said invite brother John Andes for a young people's meeting I've got something I want to say wowow and then brother John says I don't know I couldn't get get away from it God just kept speaking I will restore like a he said like a thunderbolt I will restore I will restore I will restore all the years of the Locust and the Palmer worm whatever it is whatever go whatever Satan has robbed from you or taken from you friends let me just say this don't miss your moment we might be crowded in here and you think there's not any room there's room at this altar we'll take these chairs right out of here if you got something upon your heart you know the the I I just felt the Lord uh just put this up so strong upon my heart brother John as you were preaching you know and and of just the the different needs and different things in your life and deformities and maybe things that happened to you that were I think the way he said it that that it was out of your control didn't do didn't ask for a forest fire didn't ask for those things to come in your life you know zachus didn't ask to be born a short man true true couldn't help it that's how he was born he didn't sign up sure I could create your own player and I make myself this tall and 6'4 and you don't get that choice in life sometimes brother Brandon called it just the grab bag of Life yes sir and he didn't get to choose it you know that he was a short man and he couldn't see Jesus couldn't help it couldn't see him in the midst of the crowd I read something so powerful stirred me up and I just want to say it tonight it said long before zachus couldn't see Jesus God had planted a tree to meet his need [Applause] Hallelujah glory and long before you came to this meeting long before you ever had that battle last week or last month or whatever you're going through God inspired the heart of a Preacher from Washington and God's here to meet your need here tonight I don't care what it is in your life don't miss your moment the the angel the man said that every time the angel comes then stirs the Waters I have no man to come and pick me up and put me in you know there's a season brother John's got something on his heart for tomorrow but this ain't tomorrow this is tonight God's God's got some other direction the Lord's going to put upon his heart but let me just say this the Holy Spirit as I was sit in that chair told me to get up here and say this don't move to tomorrow yet don't move to tonight in in the Pavilion here don't miss this moment whatever it is upon your heart you need to you you right there your seat is fine we're crowded you you know and and maybe there's thoughts well we couldn't even get out let me just let me rebuke that devil here for a moment we set these chairs up and we intentionally said we're leaving a space if you have a need and you want it and you something in your heart whatever your level of faith is brother bandam said God will meet you with that level of faith and if there was a tug on your heart to say I want to go a little further you know you want the minister to come and lay his hands upon you and pour your heart out I I'll leave that to you and the Holy Spirit but I just don't I don't want to Rush this moment I don't want to rush out these doors and just get get to the next thing the devil would love us to do that but God the holy spirit is saying just hold on a minute even if we just worship we're going to sing a few songs here even if just worship there right at your seat let the Holy Spirit deal with your heart I will restore s the [Music] Lord Lord my life is in your hand all my dream yes Lord all my can you do that can you place them Lord I place them in your hands I
