[4:18] Father, we love you this evening.
[4:21] Lord, remember when brother Dale
[4:22] preached
[4:24] that sermon, Lord, not like we expected,
[4:27] but it still but your word still comes
[4:29] to pass, Father. And we thank you for
[4:31] that. As we gather together this
[4:34] evening, Lord, we just pray that you
[4:35] would have your way, Lord, that your
[4:38] spirit could speak to us and we would be
[4:40] receptive to what you would say to us,
[4:42] Father. Lord, I pray that you would just
[4:44] fill us again, Lord, to overflowing with
[4:47] your Holy Spirit. Lord, we don't rest on
[4:50] yesterday's laurels
[4:53] or the experiences that we may have had
[4:55] in our lives. Father, we are looking
[4:58] forward, pressing the battle, looking
[5:00] for that day that Father, we will come
[5:03] home, a change of the body and have a
[5:06] new body just like your own glorious
[5:08] body.
[5:10] I pray for our sick and afflicted this
[5:13] evening. Father, Lord, people battling
[5:16] different things. Father, we just lift
[5:18] them up before you, Lord. You said that
[5:20] you were by your stripes we are healed.
[5:25] And Lord, there's not a a greater power
[5:27] on earth than your word. Heavens and
[5:29] earth will pass away, but your word will
[5:31] not fail.
[5:33] Commit ourselves to you this evening.
[5:35] Lord, the minister that would come.
[5:37] Father, I know in his heart he would
[5:40] just like to move aside and allow you to
[5:42] have your way. And that's what we pray
[5:44] for. That that gift would have
[5:45] preeminence in our lives this evening.
[5:47] Father, may your Holy Spirit speak to
[5:50] us. Bless the tithes and offerings as we
[5:52] collect it. remember those that are
[5:54] streaming, Father. Lord, you're not just
[5:57] confined to this building, but I pray
[5:59] that you anoint your word wherever it
[6:01] would go and bless your people in Jesus'
[6:03] name. Amen.

[26:56] to give an update for my dad. He is um
[26:59] doing really well and uh he's actually
[27:01] doing uh just phenomenal and we're just
[27:04] uh believing I believe with all of my
[27:06] heart that prayer changed everything.
[27:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:10] &gt;&gt; And uh we we went through quite a little
[27:13] last 48 hours um there from Sunday uh
[27:17] Sunday afternoon all the way through
[27:19] yesterday or Monday when he was uh
[27:21] discharged. and uh he went and got a
[27:24] very good report. She and his
[27:25] cardiologist we were there with him um
[27:28] today's Wednesday, Monday. So um we were
[27:32] there Monday and um and all I can say
[27:36] friends is that it's just the grace of
[27:37] God and the mercy of God.
[27:40] &gt;&gt; But the cardiologist had such a good
[27:42] report doesn't uh concluded there was no
[27:45] heart attack. Um in spite of what signs
[27:48] he was exhibiting, there was no heart
[27:49] attack. They think it was some type of
[27:51] veagal spasm from overexertion.
[27:54] And uh if you were here on Sunday, he
[27:57] was overly exerting.
[28:00] And so, um but uh but anyway, I just
[28:02] wanted to give that report. He's doing
[28:04] very good. I'm sure he'll give more
[28:06] details to that tonight. He was
[28:08] determined to preach tonight. And uh and
[28:10] I was determined not to let him. And uh
[28:13] but he wanted to so bad, but he actually
[28:15] just was had every intention of doing
[28:18] it. But you know that stay in that
[28:20] hospital of no sleep at all, you don't
[28:22] really sleep at all really caught up to
[28:24] him like a ton of bricks today just in
[28:26] the afternoon and he just wasn't sick at
[28:28] all. He just felt wiped out uh from from
[28:31] from the days in the hospital. So we
[28:34] also have a trip Lord Will be going this
[28:36] uh this Friday to travel to minister
[28:38] meetings there for brother David McGiri
[28:41] uh in Texas and Dallas Fort Worth area
[28:43] Bedford, Texas. And so he wanted to be
[28:46] well rested for that. And so um I was
[28:49] obliged to take the service uh on short
[28:52] notice, but that's all right. Amen. You
[28:54] love the Lord Jesus.
[28:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Did you come to see him? Amen.
[28:59] Good to have brother Jason, Sister Amy

[29:07] them here tonight. If you have your
[29:08] Bible, Matthew chapter 12. I'll have you
[29:11] turn. And I'm gonna title this sermon
[29:13] tonight um get rid of your rats or
[29:18] getting rid of your rats.
[29:22] &gt;&gt; Matthew 12 verse 43. When the unclean
[29:26] spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh
[29:30] through dry places seeking rest and
[29:33] findeth none. Then he said, I will
[29:36] return unto my house from whence I came
[29:39] out. And when he has come, he findeth it
[29:42] empty, swept, and garnished. Then goeth
[29:46] he, and taketh with himself seven other
[29:49] spirits, notice this, more wicked
[29:54] than himself.
[29:56] And they enter in and dwell there. And
[29:59] notice what Jesus says. And the last
[30:03] state of that man is worse than the
[30:07] first.
[30:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Even so shall it be also unto this
[30:12] wicked generation. Amen. Maybe you have
[30:16] a need upon your heart. You just want to
[30:17] make a hand. Lift that hand up. Hold it
[30:19] before the Lord as we just bow our
[30:21] heads. Jesus, Lord, you are our refuge,
[30:24] our strong tower. You've proven
[30:27] yourself, Lord, time and time again.
[30:30] Father David said, "When my heart is
[30:32] overwhelmed,
[30:34] lead me to a rock that is higher than I,
[30:37] Lord." Lord. And that was, Father, just
[30:39] days ago, we were in that condition. But
[30:42] Lord, we found the rock that is higher
[30:44] than I,
[30:45] &gt;&gt; Lord. And you intervene in a
[30:46] supernatural way in this church, Lord.
[30:48] We, as your children, give thanks for
[30:51] your wonderful works, Lord. You never,
[30:53] Lord God, cease to show yourself real
[30:56] and alive, Lord, by infallible proof. I
[31:00] pray, God, that you would just be with
[31:01] us now, Lord, on this Wednesday night
[31:03] service, Lord. May you just be near,
[31:06] Lord, and be real to each one that's
[31:08] here, Lord. Father, the ones that are
[31:11] present, the ones that are streaming. I
[31:13] pray, God, that you would just come and
[31:14] minister to your word, Lord, to your
[31:16] people. We long for it tonight. We pray,
[31:19] God, that you'd bless it. We pray in
[31:21] Jesus' name. Amen. You can be seated.
[31:24] I sent a uh slide, brothers, if you
[31:26] could just have that those quotes, uh
[31:28] that would be awesome.
[31:32] I want to just read you because I know
[31:33] that this title um can uh can cause some
[31:37] people to squirm. Uh but so I just want
[31:40] to read just to give it some context
[31:42] here. The way the Lord gave me this
[31:44] sermon was just really uh quite sudden
[31:46] and supernatural. So I just want to look
[31:49] at this here for a moment. We'll come
[31:50] back to our scripture. Listen to what
[31:52] brother Brandham says here. And this
[31:53] sermon that I've I'm reading from uh
[31:56] would be a good one for you to listen to
[31:58] if you haven't heard it in a while. I
[32:00] just gleaned through it and I'm just
[32:02] catching some of the highlights from it
[32:04] to minister this thought. Brother
[32:06] Brandham says in this message, why is it
[32:10] that so many Christians find it so hard
[32:14] to live the Christian life? 1957 in
[32:17] March. Now, what happens when the old
[32:21] spirit has gone out of a man? The Bible
[32:24] said the devil has gone out of the man.
[32:27] He walks away in dry places. You give me
[32:29] that microphone, Brother Ken. I forgot
[32:31] to put on the the headset and so I'll
[32:33] just use that one. I know Brother Brad
[32:35] don't want me using this one. So, we're
[32:37] going to switch out. Amen.
[32:40] Is it on?
[32:44] Praise the Lord. You got me.
[32:45] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You got me.
[32:47] &gt;&gt; Mic check. One, two, everybody hear me.
[32:54] &gt;&gt; Spirit has gone out of a man. The Bible
[32:57] says the devil has gone out of the man.
[32:59] He walks in dry places and comes back to
[33:03] find the house all swept out. You know
[33:06] what happens? Well, you once lived in an
[33:09] old ten can alley. That's right. Where
[33:12] all the devils and rats and everything
[33:16] else lived. fusses and fights and stews
[33:19] and arguments. But when the Holy Spirit
[33:22] comes in, he can't live in a place like
[33:25] that.
[33:26] &gt;&gt; That's the reason people today can shout
[33:29] and scream and go on but live any kind
[33:32] of a life afterwards.
[33:35] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit when it moves in, it
[33:38] takes God's I love how Brother Brandham
[33:40] says this. It takes God's big bulldozer
[33:44] and comes down and digs that old alley
[33:48] up, throws the dirt out, buries it in
[33:51] the sea of forgetfulness, and terraces
[33:54] off a nice big place and puts up a great
[33:59] big mansion. And he lives there. Aren't
[34:01] you glad he lives there? and the flowers
[34:05] of love, joy, peace, longsuffering,
[34:10] goodness, and mercies and kindness and
[34:14] faith is blooming around this house.
[34:17] Brother Brandham says, "Glory, when the
[34:19] Holy Spirit moves in, the 10 cans and
[34:23] rats, lies, backbiting, selfishness,
[34:28] indifference with other Christians, all
[34:31] move out." How many believers we have?
[34:34] &gt;&gt; How many believes that the Bible says,
[34:36] "Whoever is in Christ is a new creation.
[34:40] &gt;&gt; Old things are passed away. Behold, some
[34:43] things have become new." It's not what
[34:46] the Bible says, but it actually says,
[34:48] "All things
[34:50] have become new." Listen to what he says
[34:53] here. "And if you" He says, "Of all
[34:54] indifference with other Christians." And
[34:57] if you've still got them, it shows the
[35:01] Holy Spirit has never terrorist out your
[35:05] life. Amen.
[35:08] Get rid of your rats. How many want to
[35:11] get rid of the rats tonight?
[35:14] I think this is amazing. And I'm just
[35:15] going to pause that just here for a
[35:17] moment because even the Bible parallels
[35:21] the unclean animal with what Jesus
[35:24] refers to in our scripture in Matthew 12
[35:28] of the unclean spirit when an unclean
[35:31] spirit goes out of a man. And so it uses
[35:35] this destructive animal like a rat.
[35:39] doesn't the Bible doesn't use the rat.
[35:40] But if you click on that word unclean
[35:43] spirit it it it it actually is connected
[35:46] with sin which is or leprosy a disease
[35:50] which is connected with sin. If you know
[35:52] anything about leprosy it is an oozing
[35:55] wound. It's something very uh physically
[35:59] to even look at uh would would gross you
[36:02] out to see a person with leprosy. It was
[36:05] it was something and and it's no
[36:07] accident that God would type sin with
[36:10] the disease of leprosy because though
[36:13] you may not see it visibly on the
[36:15] outside, but what sin has done to that
[36:18] person who is addicted to alcohol,
[36:21] addicted to drugs, addicted to sex,
[36:24] addicted to, you know, any kind of vice,
[36:26] what that person might look like on the
[36:28] outside is all very different than the
[36:31] spirit that is living in their temple.
[36:34] or their house. You see, who you are, as
[36:37] we know, is not what we always present
[36:39] from the outside, but there's a man on
[36:42] the inside that is controlling the man
[36:44] on the outside. Can you say amen? And so
[36:47] that man on the outside, that little
[36:50] rudder, as brother Brandham uses that
[36:52] scripture in James talking about the
[36:54] tongue, that how that that little bitty
[36:56] rudder uh control an entire ship. And
[37:00] the prophet says, "See in your ship as a
[37:02] little man in a little control room, and
[37:04] that's who's pushing the buttons, and
[37:06] that's who's pulling the levers is the
[37:09] man who's in that little control room
[37:12] controlling your vessel." Now, I I want
[37:16] you to notice this here because the
[37:18] Bible in Leviticus 11, it speaks of the
[37:21] unclean animals. It it talks about
[37:24] creeping things and things that were uh
[37:26] considered sinful or symbolized sin,
[37:29] things that were considered unclean. Uh
[37:32] even as as the Bible speaks of uh swine
[37:36] in this way, speaks of uh uh pigs in
[37:38] that way. It's a picture in of
[37:41] uncleanness similar to what we find in
[37:43] rats. And you know what's amazing about
[37:45] a rat is a rat actually is made from
[37:49] God. This is how God makes him. That he
[37:52] actually thrives in filth. Think about
[37:55] that here for a moment.
[37:57] &gt;&gt; That a rat actually's environment
[38:00] thrives in what we would call filth.
[38:03] Isn't that just like the devil? He
[38:06] thrives in filthy atmospheres.
[38:11] &gt;&gt; He thrives in filthy places. That's why
[38:14] you'll always find Brother Brandham
[38:16] talking about that about clubs. He says
[38:18] the same thing about bars. He talks
[38:20] about bowling alleys and movie theaters
[38:22] in the same way. It was not the place or
[38:25] the building, the brick, the mortar, the
[38:26] shingles, the drywall. It was the
[38:29] spirits of filth that inhabited those
[38:32] places. That's why there are some places
[38:34] that a Christian doesn't go. Can you say
[38:36] amen? There's some places that we don't
[38:39] go because the Holy Spirit inside of us
[38:42] isn't comfortable in filth.
[38:46] But there's some places that we do go
[38:48] because the Holy Ghost is attracted to
[38:51] to to to the house of God. He's that's
[38:53] why we gather in a building like this
[38:55] and we create an atmosphere because it
[38:57] invites the right kind of spirits in our
[39:00] midst.
[39:03] &gt;&gt; And so the scripture talks about this
[39:05] that that it it was a picture of
[39:07] uncleanness. And and and it's amazing.
[39:09] I'm just going to give you some of these
[39:11] natural facts here about rats. Rats
[39:13] multiply rapidly. One pair of rats can
[39:17] produce thousands of rats in one year.
[39:22] Now, I want you to think spiritually.
[39:24] Don't think uh you know in in such a
[39:26] natural way. We lived uh actually there
[39:29] for a little while with some rats in our
[39:30] attic. Lived you've sure have have been
[39:32] in homes before where you're laying in
[39:34] bed at night and you can hear rats
[39:36] moving through the attic or rats moving,
[39:38] you know, underneath. If you live in a
[39:40] crawl space home, it's very common to
[39:42] have rats moving through the crawl
[39:44] space. Just the feeling or the the the
[39:46] the sense of knowing though the rat is
[39:48] not in your home, he's not in your bed,
[39:51] he's not even in your bedroom, he's just
[39:53] he's completely in another partition
[39:55] that he can't get to you, yet there's an
[39:57] uneasy feeling. Uh can I get an amen,
[40:00] sisters? There's an une uneasy And you
[40:02] brothers, if you'd be honest, you'd say
[40:04] amen, too. There's an uneasiness about a
[40:07] rat. What is it about a rat that we
[40:09] don't like? There's a an actually a
[40:11] nature inside of that animal that is
[40:14] detestable to you because that's what a
[40:16] rat is. He's a filthy animal and carries
[40:21] that filth with him. And that's why we
[40:23] are detracted from them.
[40:26] &gt;&gt; And so rats multiply. If you let them
[40:29] and create the right environment, they
[40:31] will multiply to the thousands in a
[40:34] year. Let me say this about sin. Sin
[40:37] spreads. It's like a disease.
[40:40] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[40:42] &gt;&gt; It is not static.
[40:45] &gt;&gt; Not choke tonight. It is not stagnant.
[40:48] It doesn't remain in its condition. But
[40:51] sin multiplies.
[40:54] &gt;&gt; In fact, sin if you give it a place will
[40:58] grow into such a level. I'm talking to
[41:01] Christians, not just I'm not I'm talking
[41:04] to believers. There's a reason the Bible
[41:06] tells believers, give no place to the
[41:09] devil.
[41:11] &gt;&gt; Resist the devil and he will flee from
[41:14] you.
[41:15] And so the thing about sin is that sin
[41:18] has the power if it's if it's left
[41:20] unchecked and it's not taken captive by
[41:24] the even let me say this friends even
[41:26] your thoughts even the thoughts that you
[41:29] think in your mind you got to be careful
[41:31] what thoughts that you allow yourself to
[41:34] ruminate over because Satan has no
[41:37] access to your soul but he does have
[41:39] access to your human spirit and the
[41:42] Bible even says that the heart has a
[41:44] mind. That's why the Bible says about
[41:46] Jesus that he knows the mind of the
[41:49] heart. When our spirit we know not what
[41:51] to pray, but within oursel we groan not
[41:54] knowing what we should speak, but the
[41:56] Bible says it this way. But he who knows
[41:58] the mind of the spirit, sorry, that's
[42:00] what it says there. He who knows the
[42:02] heart and the mind of the spirit.
[42:05] &gt;&gt; And so, Satan has no access to your
[42:07] soul, but he can access your human
[42:10] spirit. And you got to be careful
[42:12] because it may not be God's thoughts.
[42:14] And it may not even be your own
[42:16] thoughts. It may be the devil's thoughts
[42:18] trying to get you to ruminate and to
[42:21] dwell on that thing. And let me say, if
[42:22] you don't take that thought captive, as
[42:25] the Bible says, take every thought
[42:27] captive uh to the to the power of Jesus
[42:30] Christ. Don't ruminate on it. Don't
[42:32] think about it. Uh but cast it out of
[42:35] your mind and say, "That's not a thought
[42:37] from my father. That's not a thought
[42:39] that I even thought. That's a thought
[42:41] from the devil and I'm going to obey the
[42:43] Bible and take that thought captive to
[42:46] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[42:48] &gt;&gt; because if you don't, you're giving
[42:50] place to that spirit. And if you watch
[42:53] sin, even sin would affect generations.
[42:56] So sin has the ability, iniquity,
[42:59] there's something about iniquity that it
[43:02] has the ability to multiply itself to
[43:06] build a garden, build a home, build a
[43:08] house, and live in that house.
[43:13] &gt;&gt; Rats, let me let me go just a little bit
[43:16] further about this. One rat, just like
[43:19] sin, can spread quickly. One rat of
[43:23] bitterness turns into a whole
[43:25] infestation of bitterness.
[43:28] &gt;&gt; No, I'm preaching very simple uh
[43:30] tonight, but uh they got I I only got
[43:32] this handheld, so you forgive me if I'm
[43:34] a little evangelistic here tonight.
[43:38] But there's something about bitterness.
[43:40] The Bible says, "Lest a root of
[43:43] bitterness springing up defiles." Notice
[43:46] not just you but bitterness infects
[43:50] others.
[43:53] &gt;&gt; You see sin is like a disease. It
[43:55] spreads. It's like an infection. It
[43:58] doesn't stay with that person. But if
[44:00] you come under the influence of a sinful
[44:03] person and you subject yourself to that
[44:05] atmosphere, you'll find sinful ways in
[44:07] your life.
[44:10] &gt;&gt; Rats uh also destroy. Listen to this.
[44:14] Rats destroy more than they eat.
[44:20] &gt;&gt; They chew wires. They chew wood. They
[44:23] chew anything you put in their way. And
[44:26] they spoil far more than what they
[44:30] consume. You see, sin doesn't just hurt
[44:33] you,
[44:34] &gt;&gt; it ruins
[44:36] others around you.
[44:40] Rats carry diseases. The bubanic plague
[44:44] spread largely because of rats and
[44:47] fleas.
[44:48] And no one likes fleas any more than a
[44:50] rat.
[44:52] But there's something about this that
[44:55] even even the the spirits when they were
[44:58] cast out of Legion requested that they
[45:01] could go into the swine. Have you ever
[45:03] thought about that? They requested that
[45:05] they can go into the swine because why?
[45:07] It was a host. It was a willing
[45:10] environment. It was a like environment,
[45:13] something that they could dwell in. So
[45:15] what that man though he started out as a
[45:17] good man, brother Brandham said he was a
[45:19] father possibly. He he said he was a
[45:21] good dad to his children, a husband to
[45:24] his wife. He didn't start off legion.
[45:26] That wasn't even his name. But the Bible
[45:28] said the Bible says that when Jesus asks
[45:31] him his name, he says my name, our name
[45:34] is Legion, for we are many. So now one
[45:39] spirit has multiplied to 2,000 spirits.
[45:44] &gt;&gt; But let me say this to you, my brother,
[45:46] my sister. He didn't start that way.
[45:47] Brother Brandham said he was a man and
[45:49] loved his children. He says, but maybe
[45:51] his temper, he never got subject. He
[45:54] never brought his temper under
[45:56] subjection to the Holy Ghost.
[46:00] &gt;&gt; Says in another place, just drank a
[46:01] little social drink here once in a
[46:03] while. Took a social drink and you don't
[46:05] realize it ain't got nothing to do with
[46:07] the alcohol. Ain't got nothing to do
[46:08] with the glass. Ain't got nothing to do
[46:10] with the ice. Ain't got nothing to do
[46:11] with the brand. It has everything to do
[46:14] with the spirit that is hiding behind
[46:16] that alcohol
[46:19] &gt;&gt; that comes to infest your life.
[46:22] &gt;&gt; And you open up a door, a channel, a
[46:25] doorway. That man opened up access to
[46:28] that demon spirit and he didn't bring it
[46:31] subject. And that spirit created a
[46:34] stronghold
[46:36] in his life.
[46:37] &gt;&gt; And before you know it, one spirit turns
[46:39] to two to four to 10 to 20. They
[46:42] multiply to a 100 to a thousand.
[46:45] &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Matt, what happened?"
[46:47] What happened was just like the spirits
[46:50] went into the swine, the man had let his
[46:54] atmosphere or his condition be that of
[46:57] uncleanness.
[46:59] And because of that uncleanness, the
[47:01] devil was just allowed to multiply
[47:03] himself in his temple.
[47:08] Rats carry disease. As we said, uh sin
[47:11] contaminates.
[47:14] What you tolerate or what we allow in
[47:18] our private life because that's who we
[47:21] really are.
[47:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. can bring poison to your church,
[47:25] to your marriage, to your home, to your
[47:28] family, to your workplace.
[47:32] &gt;&gt; It contaminates. It doesn't just stay
[47:34] there. It contaminates. And what we
[47:36] allow in our private life, not what
[47:38] people see at church, not what people
[47:40] see at the youth camp, not what people
[47:42] see at special meetings, but who you
[47:44] are, who you really are, is when no one
[47:47] else is there and the church isn't there
[47:49] and you're somewhere off on your own.
[47:51] that. Listen, friends, I'm just going to
[47:52] be honest with you. Uh, you want to know
[47:54] who you really are? That's who you
[47:56] really are.
[47:58] &gt;&gt; We might put on a good mask here, like a
[48:01] Pharisee, a good actor, but who we
[48:03] really are is who we are when no one
[48:05] else is watching.
[48:08] &gt;&gt; And so, you know, another thing about
[48:10] rats, rats hide in the dark. They love
[48:13] the dark. They thrive. Think about that.
[48:16] They thrive in the absence of light.
[48:22] when wherever a place that light can't
[48:25] reach, that's where they live.
[48:29] &gt;&gt; And and and very much the same way that
[48:31] sin hides itself in the dark. It stays
[48:35] in secret places and secret channels. Uh
[48:38] Ephesians 5:13, I love the scripture
[48:40] says, "All things that are reproved are
[48:45] made manifest by the light."
[48:49] It's amazing what happens when you turn
[48:50] the light on.
[48:53] &gt;&gt; And and and another thing about rats is
[48:55] rats are almost you can if you have an
[48:58] infestation of rats, it is almost
[49:00] impossible to just you say, "I'm just
[49:02] going to kill a rat." Well, that's fine
[49:04] because you kill one and there's 10 more
[49:05] the next week
[49:07] &gt;&gt; and then you kill 10 and there's 20 more
[49:08] the next week. They multiply.
[49:11] You know what you have to do? You have
[49:13] to remove the food source.
[49:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[49:17] &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody.
[49:19] &gt;&gt; How do you how do you get rid of the
[49:21] devil? Starve him out.
[49:23] &gt;&gt; Don't give him a place. Starve him out.
[49:25] You say, "I got to get rid of this
[49:27] temper." Stop giving him a bedding
[49:29] ground to to dwell in. You got to starve
[49:31] him out. You You say, "I got to get rid
[49:34] of this anxiety and this depression
[49:35] that's so uh overcoming me." Starve him
[49:38] out. Don't feed on things that produce
[49:41] depression.
[49:44] &gt;&gt; You got to starve him. you got. You can
[49:46] set traps. You can uh But let me say
[49:48] this, friends. I don't care how many
[49:50] traps you set. If the trash uh still
[49:53] remains in your life, the devil will
[49:55] still have a place. I can hear the
[49:57] prophet say, "What do you do when you
[49:58] apply the token? You take the trash
[50:00] out."
[50:02] &gt;&gt; Oh, how many want to take the trash out
[50:04] of our life and say, "God, let me take
[50:06] all of those things, all as brother
[50:07] Brandham said, all of those spirits of
[50:09] lies and backbiting and and bitterness
[50:12] and and and and anger. Lord, take all
[50:15] the trash out of my life.
[50:18] &gt;&gt; Rats can can can
[50:21] rats can can chew.
[50:25] Don't let me scare you now.
[50:27] Through almost anything,
[50:30] &gt;&gt; concrete, wood, metal, steel,
[50:33] fabricated, doesn't matter how you want
[50:35] to do it. They are destructive
[50:40] in nature.
[50:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:45] You can think of you there's so many
[50:48] examples I can give of this.
[50:51] But you can think of of of the way that
[50:54] even a farmer has a storage shed full of
[50:56] grain and then that rat comes in and
[50:59] stores that grain. But if you let a rat
[51:01] get in there, they don't just eat the
[51:03] grain, they they they they destroy it.
[51:06] They even just their presence in the
[51:08] grain soils the the grain. It's
[51:10] unusable.
[51:11] and they they'll chew through sacks and
[51:13] ruin an entire harvest uh for a farmer.
[51:16] Let me say friends, you say that's
[51:17] natural things, that's what lust, that's
[51:20] what bitterness, come on, somebody,
[51:22] &gt;&gt; that's what those things will do if you
[51:24] allow them in your vessel.
[51:27] &gt;&gt; They will ruin your harvest. It spoils
[51:31] what God is so desperately trying to
[51:34] grow in your life. Amen.
[51:38] &gt;&gt; And it's it's a very sometimes a very
[51:40] silent destroyer. You can you can many
[51:43] times uh homes you you'll see the the
[51:46] damage uh in the walls from the rap. And
[51:49] what you know you know what's amazing is
[51:51] most of the times man I'm just Lord
[51:54] there's so much in this right now I
[51:55] can't even hardly I can't even get to
[51:57] all of it. You know what's so amazing
[51:58] about a rat is that most of the times
[52:00] you'll see the damage or the evidence of
[52:03] the rat before you ever see the rat.
[52:05] Amen.
[52:06] &gt;&gt; And most time in people's life, the
[52:08] effect of sin is more. You you never
[52:10] know it. And then suddenly all of a
[52:12] sudden, they're gone. They've left.
[52:14] They're in the world. They've been
[52:15] living a double life. And you're like,
[52:16] "Who is this person?" What you didn't
[52:18] know is they never got rid of the rat.
[52:24] &gt;&gt; They're they're a silent destroyer and
[52:27] they bring destruction.
[52:29] And by the time the evidence on the
[52:32] outside is shown, destruction has
[52:34] already been at work. on the inside.
[52:39] Are you here tonight?
[52:41] &gt;&gt; Just trying to feel the Holy Spirit
[52:42] where to go from from here. It's amazing
[52:46] because this is exactly how rats act.
[52:49] Listen to what Brother Random says here.
[52:51] I'm just going to go through this quote
[52:53] unless I forget to get back to it.
[52:55] Brother Random says, "Get rid of your
[52:57] rats." How many want to get rid of our
[52:58] rats?
[53:00] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost takes away. Notice the
[53:03] Holy Ghost takes away them differences.
[53:09] &gt;&gt; Maybe uh the next slide if you could
[53:11] advance it. The Holy Spirit takes away
[53:14] them differences. It makes you full of
[53:18] love,
[53:20] joy,
[53:22] &gt;&gt; peace.
[53:23] &gt;&gt; Look at the flowers blooming around.
[53:26] Satan just can't step his dirty foot on
[53:29] there for your life is dead and you're
[53:32] hitting God through Christ and sealed by
[53:35] the Holy Ghost. Aren't you glad that the
[53:37] Holy Ghost can put such a seal over your
[53:40] life? The rats are sealed out and they
[53:42] can't get in. Then what comes forth? Why
[53:46] the Holy Spirit's living there? These
[53:47] flowers just actually I love how Brother
[53:49] Brandham says this. These flowers just
[53:52] actually accompany the Holy Spirit.
[53:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:56] &gt;&gt; You mean you ain't got to produce them?
[53:58] They just accompany the Holy Spirit.
[54:01] &gt;&gt; You know, that's what brother Brandham
[54:02] said about the gifts of the spirit. So
[54:04] that's the problem why we have so much
[54:05] impersonation with gifts because people
[54:07] try to manufacture them. If you really
[54:09] got the Holy Ghost, brother, you ain't
[54:11] got to manufacture the gift. Brother
[54:13] Brandham said it this way. A normal
[54:15] human will do what normal humans do
[54:18] &gt;&gt; and a normal Christian will do what
[54:20] normal Christians do.
[54:23] &gt;&gt; He says the flowers actually accompany
[54:25] the Holy Spirit. Now, you can't go and
[54:28] get some of these artificial flowers
[54:30] &gt;&gt; and set them out in the yard cuz they
[54:33] haven't got any life in them.
[54:37] &gt;&gt; And you say, "Well, I joined church. I
[54:39] guess I'm just going to have to be this
[54:41] way." You're a miserable wretch.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; Listen, friends, let me tell you what
[54:47] the prophet's trying to say. If you if
[54:48] you think that serving God is I got to
[54:50] make myself this way and I got to make
[54:52] myself a better person, you are a
[54:54] miserable wretch. I give you the words
[54:56] of a vindicated prophet. The Holy Ghost
[54:58] produces an automatic life.
[55:01] &gt;&gt; It automatically loves. Come on,
[55:03] somebody. It automatically forgives. It
[55:07] ain't no choice to forgive, friends. It
[55:09] ain't no Well, I want to. You got to. If
[55:12] the Holy Ghost is living in you, you got
[55:14] to you're constrained to do it. Yeah.
[55:17] Well, I want to love. You ain't got a
[55:19] choice. I think we ought to change our
[55:21] perspective as the family of God and
[55:22] stop. Well, I I I want to do this and
[55:24] ain't about to want to. You must do it.
[55:27] You got to do it. If you're a Christian,
[55:29] you will do it.
[55:31] &gt;&gt; And so, Brother Bam says, he says, you
[55:33] can't get that old flower. But when the
[55:34] Holy Ghost is there, it just listen
[55:37] automatically loves. So I could pull
[55:40] every hair in her head out.
[55:43] &gt;&gt; Oh that old one this old trinity that
[55:45] old this that and the other. I wouldn't
[55:47] speak to her. Will I go down to that
[55:49] meeting? Why? Oh you old Pharisee.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; A Pharisee means an actor.
[55:57] &gt;&gt; You're only trying to act religious. If
[55:59] you had the real Holy Ghost in there,
[56:01] he'd put a love in your heart for every
[56:05] man
[56:06] &gt;&gt; that believed in the name of the Lord
[56:08] Jesus Christ. Pharisee means actor.
[56:11] You're trying to act like something
[56:13] you're not.
[56:15] &gt;&gt; You got an artificial flower. Your house
[56:17] is made up of a paste board and rats has
[56:22] ate it up. That's right. The Holy Ghost
[56:26] runs the church. Do you believe that?
[56:28] The Holy Ghost is the love of God.
[56:33] &gt;&gt; That's what brother Brandon says. While
[56:34] men who tried to express the love of
[56:35] God, one of them said, and he's going to
[56:37] quote, "The love of God, how rich and
[56:39] pure, how measureless
[56:41] and strong it shall forever more
[56:44] endure." The saints and angels song, the
[56:47] love of God, how fathomless, how
[56:49] bottomless, how endless is the love of
[56:51] God. And you don't have to manufacture
[56:53] it to a believer. It comes automatically
[56:56] out of your life.
[56:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:59] &gt;&gt; It's amazing because he talks about this
[57:01] here at the beginning and he says,
[57:03] "Notice what you were." If you could go
[57:05] to the second slide, brother Joshu just
[57:07] bring it back up and hold it there just
[57:08] for a moment. I want you to notice,
[57:10] brother says, "Once you lived in a ten
[57:13] can alley." I love this. So, I want you
[57:16] to notice this because the prophet
[57:17] begins to paint this picture that one
[57:20] time you lived in an old alley, a ten
[57:23] can alley. You know, that kind of alley
[57:25] that no one wants to walk through at
[57:27] night. That's what he's referring to.
[57:29] &gt;&gt; That was your life
[57:31] &gt;&gt; before Christ.
[57:33] &gt;&gt; As brother Mark said, BC.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; That was BC. That was the BC me, the
[57:39] before Christ. How many's glad you got a
[57:41] BC,
[57:42] &gt;&gt; but you got an AD? Amen. A after Christ
[57:47] is all that matters.
[57:49] &gt;&gt; But before that, you were in a back
[57:51] alley. The kind of that no one wants to
[57:53] walk through. 10 cans. You can imagine
[57:55] 10 cans just spread out everywhere.
[57:58] Homeless people laying on the side of
[57:59] the street. All the trash all around on
[58:02] some back alley. The smell of garbage in
[58:04] the air. Rats running all over the
[58:06] ground. You say, "Brother Matt, you know
[58:08] that's grossing me out." Well, I'm
[58:09] trying to get you to see the picture of
[58:11] what your life was like. No matter how
[58:13] good it looked on the outside, you
[58:15] Facebook post looks like you got your
[58:17] life together. Listen, friends, my Bible
[58:19] says that that he that lives in sin is
[58:22] dead while you live.
[58:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:26] &gt;&gt; And rats all around, people arguing,
[58:28] fussing, fighting, stewing, a place of
[58:31] confusion, a place of filth. This is
[58:34] what brother Brandon's referring to when
[58:35] he says, "You lived in an old ten can
[58:37] alley where all the devils and rats and
[58:40] everything else lived, fusses and fights
[58:42] and stews and arguments." And this is
[58:45] what the heart looks like before the
[58:47] Holy Ghost comes in. Full of clutter,
[58:50] full of of confusion, full of anger,
[58:53] full of sin, full of selfishness,
[58:57] full of pride, full of strife.
[59:00] But let me give you the good news that
[59:03] brother Brandham gives us. The prophet
[59:05] of God says, "But when the Holy Spirit
[59:07] moves in," Come on, somebody go to the
[59:09] next slide, Brother Josh. When the Holy
[59:11] Spirit moves in, it takes God's great
[59:14] big bulldozer.
[59:17] &gt;&gt; He's not there to renovate. I promise
[59:19] when the bulldozer shows up to your
[59:20] house, he ain't there to renovate you
[59:22] and to wash you and pressure wash you
[59:25] and put a new paint job on you. When the
[59:27] bulldozer comes, he wants to tear you
[59:29] down to the ground and say you get you
[59:32] can't build upon your old life. It's got
[59:34] to be a new life in Christ. Old things
[59:37] got to pass away. And behold, all things
[59:40] are become new.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; And he doesn't just sweep around a
[59:44] little bit and sweep the street, you
[59:46] know, hang curtains over broken windows.
[59:48] I'm so glad God doesn't do me that way.
[59:51] He's not there to put curtains and put a
[59:52] new paint job over it, but he takes his
[59:54] bulldozer. He tears the old alley down.
[59:57] He tears the old life around. He starts
[1:00:00] from the ground up and builds a brand
[1:00:02] new, not shack, not shanty, not some
[1:00:05] back alley. He builds a mansion,
[1:00:07] brother, because he's going to live in
[1:00:09] that temple.
[1:00:11] Amen.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; And you notice this without the spirit,
[1:00:15] you know, as the prophet of God says in
[1:00:16] that old alley, the dirt, the he says he
[1:00:19] buries it and then he terraces off a
[1:00:21] nice big place and puts up a great big
[1:00:25] mansion.
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; And lives there. Thank God.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; And so it's all of this without that God
[1:00:32] removes all of those that things from
[1:00:34] that dirty alley. All the rats of
[1:00:36] bitterness, the rats of pride, the rats
[1:00:38] of jealousy, the ten cans of lies. Come
[1:00:41] on, somebody. The stink and the stench
[1:00:44] of selfishness.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; Say, "Oh, brother Matt, what are you
[1:00:48] preaching?" I'm preaching that whoever's
[1:00:50] in Christ, he's a I'm talking about not
[1:00:52] a reformation. I'm talking about a real
[1:00:54] transformation.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; All of the stink and the stench is gone.
[1:00:58] All of the all all of those things from
[1:01:01] the past, you can put on religious
[1:01:04] clothes. You can shout, you can scream,
[1:01:06] as the prophet said, carry a Bible.
[1:01:08] Doesn't matter if your heart hasn't been
[1:01:11] cleaned. If you haven't really been born
[1:01:13] of the spirit of God, you're still
[1:01:15] living in an old ten can alley.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; And let me say this to you, my brother,
[1:01:21] my sister. Your home here, your home
[1:01:25] there is only a reflection of where you
[1:01:28] lived here.
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; That's why there will be a city. The my
[1:01:33] Bible says, "And out inside that city,
[1:01:36] there won't be no new moons. There won't
[1:01:38] be no sunrise and sunsets because the
[1:01:40] lamb is the light of the city." Listen,
[1:01:44] there will be people that live outside
[1:01:45] of the city. And the Bible says they
[1:01:47] still live by the seasons. They still
[1:01:49] live by the new moons. They still they
[1:01:51] what are they doing? They're living by
[1:01:52] the good times and the bad times, the
[1:01:54] ups, the downs, the ins, the outs. And
[1:01:56] the prophet says, "Why was it? Don't you
[1:01:58] see what it was? It's a reflection of
[1:02:00] where they lived here. Oh, but the bride
[1:02:03] is living where the lamb is the light
[1:02:05] because where she lived here, he was the
[1:02:08] light of their life. It wasn't in and
[1:02:10] out and up and down. It was a rest, a
[1:02:13] perfect rest in Christ.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; My work is over when I come to Jesus.
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Can you say amen
[1:02:22] tonight?
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; And so, notice this here. He takes that
[1:02:26] bulldozer. This is the work of the Holy
[1:02:29] Ghost in your life. He takes that
[1:02:30] bulldozer and he begins to clean all of
[1:02:34] the trash.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; He begins to clean all of the trash and
[1:02:38] he doesn't just pile it up, you know,
[1:02:40] and take it to some kind of, you know,
[1:02:42] landfield
[1:02:44] where it could be drugged up again.
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; He puts it in the sea of his
[1:02:49] forgetfulness.
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad God's got a sea of
[1:02:54] forgetfulness?
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. And there ain't no bottom to that
[1:02:58] sea of forgetfulness. It reminds me of
[1:03:01] that man. Brother Brandham talks about
[1:03:02] that old man who his daughter was so
[1:03:04] embarrassed by him. All he ever all he'd
[1:03:06] ever do is shout and and shout and
[1:03:08] reading the Bible. He'd shout and
[1:03:10] scream. Every time he'd pull open the
[1:03:12] Bible, he'd just start shouting in his
[1:03:14] bedroom. And and you know, it
[1:03:16] embarrassed his his, you know, social
[1:03:17] culture daughter. You know, had friends
[1:03:19] over to the house. And brother Baron
[1:03:21] said she had all of her social friends
[1:03:23] and her her little friends. She didn't
[1:03:24] want to embarrass, you know, got to got
[1:03:26] to keep the image, you know, don't
[1:03:27] really want people to think you're a
[1:03:29] weirdo, you know, got to keep those kind
[1:03:31] of things. So, we take all the message
[1:03:32] books and the pillar of fire, we put
[1:03:34] those up, you know, don't don't give off
[1:03:35] the wrong impression. Listen, friends,
[1:03:37] I'm not ashamed of this gospel.
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; I'm not ashamed. If you ever get a
[1:03:42] boldness and let me tell you what, if
[1:03:44] you ever realize who you are, if you
[1:03:46] ever get a if you if you get out of your
[1:03:48] identity crisis and realize you are the
[1:03:50] bloodbought uh uh spotless chase virgin
[1:03:54] bride of Jesus Christ and you know who
[1:03:56] you are, you won't be ashamed to tell
[1:03:58] people about it. You won't be ashamed of
[1:04:00] the name of Christ. You'll wear it like
[1:04:02] a robe of pride and joy to say, "I'm not
[1:04:06] who I once was. I'm not the old man that
[1:04:08] I once was. I have been purchased by the
[1:04:11] lamb of God. I'm a new creature in
[1:04:13] Christ Jesus.
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; Brother Vam says she didn't want to. She
[1:04:17] had all of her friends over. She said,
[1:04:18] "Daddy, you know, you just be quiet."
[1:04:20] So, she took his Bible away.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; She said cuz every time he read that
[1:04:23] Bible, he start shouting and screaming.
[1:04:25] And so, she just gave him a geography
[1:04:27] book and he goes upstairs, you know, and
[1:04:29] every time he'd read that Bible. So,
[1:04:31] she's down there with all of her
[1:04:32] friends, you know, have all of her
[1:04:34] social friends over. All of a sudden,
[1:04:35] she hears him stomping and shouting and
[1:04:37] jumping, thinking, "What in the world?"
[1:04:39] I took his Bible away. I I gave him a a
[1:04:42] geography book. She walked in there and
[1:04:44] said, "Daddy, what are you doing?" Why
[1:04:45] are you shouting? She says, "Oh, honey."
[1:04:47] He says, "You gave me this geography
[1:04:49] book and I just got to reading about the
[1:04:51] ocean." And he says, "I just read here
[1:04:53] that scientists have discovered that the
[1:04:56] ocean actually have never discovered
[1:04:58] that the the bottom of the ocean that
[1:05:00] it's bottomless." And she says, "Well,
[1:05:02] why does that make you happy?" He says,
[1:05:03] "Because I started thinking about the
[1:05:05] sea of my father's forgetfulness that
[1:05:08] there's not a bottom to it and my sin is
[1:05:11] still falling and the devil can't find
[1:05:13] it."
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother, you ought to make
[1:05:16] you shout. I'd make a Baptist shout to
[1:05:19] know that my sins which were many have
[1:05:21] all been washed away.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:05:25] God comes in and he he bulldozes that
[1:05:28] old alley and he builds a brand new
[1:05:31] mansion. a temple for his spirit to
[1:05:35] dwell in.
[1:05:38] He's not there to patch up that alley,
[1:05:40] but he's there to build a whole new
[1:05:42] house. Can you say amen?
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; And so now God further than that. Listen
[1:05:47] to this. And he puts up a great big
[1:05:49] mansion and lives there. And the flowers
[1:05:52] of love,
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; joy,
[1:05:56] peace,
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; longsuffering,
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; goodness. Come on, somebody. Amen.
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; Mercies,
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; kindness,
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; faith is blooming around this house.
[1:06:11] Keep going, brother Josh. Glory. He says
[1:06:14] is blooming around this house. When the
[1:06:16] Holy Spirit moves in, tin cans and rats,
[1:06:18] backbiting, selflessness. So notice
[1:06:20] this. He builds that mansion. But you
[1:06:22] know what I love that brother Brandon
[1:06:24] says here? He builds the mansion, but he
[1:06:27] doesn't just leave the yard barren.
[1:06:31] Amen.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; Something about landscaping,
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; it will transform your house.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; You could take a house that is
[1:06:42] beautiful, built right, looks good, but
[1:06:45] just has barrenness around it. No grass,
[1:06:47] no greenery, no shrubs, no nothing.
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; It's amazing. It It's like the flowers
[1:06:53] and the life and the fragrance put that
[1:06:56] house in a a completely different
[1:06:58] perspective. Yeah.
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; How many knows that I'm talking about
[1:07:01] the what I'm saying is true?
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; And so God doesn't just leave the gu
[1:07:05] leave the ground barren,
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; but he actually plants something there.
[1:07:09] Do you know why he plants something
[1:07:12] there? Can I tell you why? By
[1:07:14] experience. Because I've learned living
[1:07:17] on property now. If you don't plant
[1:07:20] something,
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; that's right.
[1:07:24] That's right.
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; Everything you don't want to grow will
[1:07:28] grow.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; And friends, it's the same way with sin.
[1:07:33] If you don't let the love, the joy, the
[1:07:36] peace, which are the fruits
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; of the spirit, longsuffering. If you
[1:07:42] don't let those things grow, then
[1:07:44] everything you don't want to grow,
[1:07:46] bitterness, malice, hate, envy, strife.
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; You see, this is the law of a garden.
[1:07:52] Our lives are like a garden.
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; How many know that's the truth?
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; Our lives are very very much like a
[1:08:00] garden. You remember the the the the the
[1:08:03] reading I think it was from Toer that my
[1:08:04] dad read from many many years ago and he
[1:08:06] talks about how that man is like a
[1:08:08] garden. He was made to dwell. It's why
[1:08:10] God puts Adam and Eve in the garden. He
[1:08:13] puts it makes it like a garden. It's a
[1:08:15] and and it's a garden that's protected
[1:08:17] by walls and a garden that's bringing
[1:08:19] bringing forth uh fruit.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; And and this is what he said. It was so
[1:08:24] powerful the way this man says this. He
[1:08:26] says, "But through sin, man was made to
[1:08:28] live in the garden. But through sin, he
[1:08:31] has been forced to dwell in a field.
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; A field which he has that he says he's
[1:08:37] to uh dwell in a field. A field which he
[1:08:39] has rested from his enemies by sweat and
[1:08:43] tears, and which he preserves only at
[1:08:48] the price of constant watchfulness
[1:08:52] and endless toil.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; I want you to catch that. He says he was
[1:08:59] made to be in a garden, but because of
[1:09:02] sin, our lives, Listen friends, I got
[1:09:04] news for you. You are not living in the
[1:09:06] Garden of Eden.
[1:09:08] This is far from the garden of Eden.
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; We as Christians have been forced to
[1:09:13] live in the field. And he says, "And now
[1:09:17] if that man he what he's what does he
[1:09:20] have to do? He has to tame the field
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; with labor and sweat and toil constant."
[1:09:26] I love how he says says this. He says
[1:09:29] he's he's he's now dwelling in a field
[1:09:31] which he's rested from his enemies.
[1:09:33] Thank God we've we've conquered the
[1:09:35] enemies in our field.
[1:09:37] by sweat, by tears, and which he
[1:09:41] preserves. How long do you have an
[1:09:43] overcoming life? How long will my
[1:09:45] victory last as long as you're watchful?
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; And you're in constant watchfulness. If
[1:09:53] you just lose your guard, man, you'll
[1:09:55] lose your victory.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; You you you let your guard down. you
[1:10:02] before you know it, you're you're
[1:10:04] falling into sin, thinking, "Was I ever
[1:10:05] even saved in the first place?"
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; And so, he's got to be constantly
[1:10:11] watchful. Notice, let him but relax his
[1:10:14] efforts for a few years, and the
[1:10:16] wilderness will claim his field again.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; The jungle and the forest will swallow
[1:10:24] his labors,
[1:10:26] and all his loving care will have been
[1:10:29] in vain.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:32] Amen.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; I just paid a a felt to me like a
[1:10:37] fortune for I had I have a drainage
[1:10:39] ditch in my property where water has to
[1:10:41] flow. It's our pond that and it's there
[1:10:44] for also for retention purposes for
[1:10:45] rain. It's the way that our house
[1:10:47] doesn't wash away because the rain
[1:10:49] collects there. Then it has an overflow
[1:10:51] ditch that goes about 700 feet and it
[1:10:53] goes to the county ditch. And I realized
[1:10:55] the pond water kept rising and rising
[1:10:57] and rising like it had never rose
[1:10:58] before. And I I went out to the ditch
[1:11:01] and realized the ditch ain't barely
[1:11:02] draining any of the overflow. The
[1:11:04] water's not getting out.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; And then, you know, I watched that
[1:11:08] because what had happened was most of
[1:11:10] the time that ditch is dry. If you have
[1:11:13] a wet ditch that's always running, it
[1:11:14] won't have the problem. But I noticed
[1:11:16] because that in our non- rainy season
[1:11:18] that ditch that ditch dies uh dries up
[1:11:21] and then when it dries up everything the
[1:11:24] weeds and the the the you know all kinds
[1:11:26] of just uh things that you don't want to
[1:11:28] grow in there wispy pond grass things
[1:11:31] that are just real coarse and no really
[1:11:33] you know just a just a a junk weed and
[1:11:36] and and and that they grow in the bottom
[1:11:38] there. I noticed because of the dry
[1:11:40] season that that all of those weeds had
[1:11:44] grown up in that ditch. You could preach
[1:11:46] on that.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; They had grown up in that ditch. And I
[1:11:50] noticed the water was not flowing out.
[1:11:53] And I realized if I want this thing to
[1:11:55] drain to the county, I'm going to have
[1:11:57] to clean the ditch out.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:01] And so I I paid a a fellow to do some
[1:12:03] more work and he got in there with his
[1:12:05] min and he just started, you know,
[1:12:07] taking all of the all of the junk and
[1:12:09] everything that had grown. He started
[1:12:11] cleaning that ditch out and I noticed
[1:12:12] the pond started draining. Water started
[1:12:14] flowing. Water got out to the county.
[1:12:16] Things were back to normal. But his
[1:12:19] tracks there that had had where his his
[1:12:21] tractor was, they had torn up all of my
[1:12:24] good ground that I had worked on. You
[1:12:26] know what I had to do? If I just let
[1:12:29] that soil that was tealed up just
[1:12:32] remain, every weed and every plant that
[1:12:35] I had worked so hard to get rid of and
[1:12:38] paid all that money, I would be within
[1:12:39] one year in the same exact boat I was in
[1:12:43] before. And let me tell you something
[1:12:45] that happens to you when you go to a
[1:12:47] revival and you get a touch from the
[1:12:49] Lord at a youth camp. You get a touch
[1:12:50] from the Lord at a great service. Listen
[1:12:53] friends, if you don't feed that
[1:12:54] experience, you might have had a good
[1:12:56] high, but in just one year down the
[1:12:58] road, you'll be down low again with
[1:13:01] weeds all growing all around you. What
[1:13:03] you got to do is you got to clean the
[1:13:05] ditch out again. You got to take the
[1:13:08] trash out again and say, "God, clean me
[1:13:11] from my head to my toes." How many want
[1:13:13] that here tonight? Clean my spirit, oh
[1:13:16] God.
[1:13:18] Because if not, if you relax, the jungle
[1:13:21] and the forest will swallow your labor.
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; Every farmer knows, and this is his
[1:13:27] words here, every farmer knows the
[1:13:29] hunger of the wilderness.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; That hunger which no modern farm
[1:13:36] machinery, no improved agricultural
[1:13:38] method can ever quite destroy.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; I asked Chad GPT that. Thought it'd give
[1:13:46] me a good answer. And I said, "Chad, I
[1:13:48] am so sick and tired of these weeds."
[1:13:50] And I had one particular one that I
[1:13:52] seemed like every time I'd cut it down,
[1:13:54] spray it down, didn't matter what I
[1:13:56] said, chat. And I'm asking him how to
[1:13:57] get rid of and what. And finally, after
[1:13:59] he's giving me all his advice, I said,
[1:14:00] "No, Chad. I want to know how do I get
[1:14:02] rid of it forever."
[1:14:06] He said, "Well, uh, that's the question
[1:14:09] farmers have been asking for hundreds of
[1:14:11] years."
[1:14:15] He said, "And oh, what a what a what a
[1:14:17] reality." He said, "What a great reality
[1:14:19] that would be." Unfortunately, that's
[1:14:21] not our reality.
[1:14:23] So, what do you got to do? You got to
[1:14:24] spray it. You got to dig it. You got to
[1:14:26] chop it up. You got to pull it up by the
[1:14:29] roots. And he says, "The hunger which no
[1:14:31] modern can ever quite destroy." No
[1:14:34] matter how well prepared, listen, no
[1:14:36] matter how well prepared the soil, how
[1:14:39] wellkept the fences, how carefully
[1:14:42] painted the buildings,
[1:14:45] Let the owner neglect for a while his
[1:14:48] prized and valued acres, and they will
[1:14:51] revert again to the wild and be
[1:14:54] swallowed up by the jungle or the
[1:14:57] wasteland.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; The bias of nature is toward the
[1:15:03] wilderness,
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; never towards the fruitful field. That
[1:15:09] we repeat, every farmer knows. It's a
[1:15:13] law that runs through our region, all
[1:15:15] the regions of our fallen world,
[1:15:17] affecting things spiritual as well as
[1:15:20] things material. We cannot escape the
[1:15:22] law that would persuade all things to
[1:15:25] remain wild or to return to a wild state
[1:15:28] after a period of cultivation. What is
[1:15:32] true, let me say to you, brother, of the
[1:15:34] field is true of your spirit. Yes. Amen.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; And after a while, you have cleanliness
[1:15:43] only from one time. Listen, friends,
[1:15:45] that's why we preach it's it's I believe
[1:15:47] in a one-time experience, but but it's
[1:15:49] not a one just a one-time experience.
[1:15:52] It's got to be a constant feeding and
[1:15:54] filling and refilling and dying out and
[1:15:57] emptying out.
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; It's got to be constant maintenance. You
[1:16:02] say, "How?" Through prayer.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; Through prayer.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. through through reading your
[1:16:08] Bible, through spending time with the
[1:16:10] Lord. That's how you maintenance your
[1:16:14] spirit.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; Let me just say, you cannot maintenance
[1:16:18] it just by coming to church. That's
[1:16:20] wonderful.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; You cannot maintenance it by just veging
[1:16:24] on YouTube. Even if it's spiritual
[1:16:26] things and sermons and shorts,
[1:16:29] you've got to spend time with the Lord.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody. You've got to spend
[1:16:36] time with the Lord.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; That's the only way to maintenance your
[1:16:41] field to only way to maintenance your
[1:16:43] garden. So God comes to plant flowers.
[1:16:46] He doesn't just leave it barren,
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; but he plants a beautiful garden. And
[1:16:53] out of that soil of a a Holy Ghost
[1:16:57] saturated soil
[1:17:00] in a in a Holy Ghost saturated
[1:17:04] atmosphere under the light of the sen.
[1:17:09] Out of that soil blooms and blossoms
[1:17:12] flowers of love and peace. Hallelujah.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; Peace.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; You know, we all want peace, but let me
[1:17:21] tell you what what we need is
[1:17:22] peacemakers.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Blessed are the
[1:17:27] peacemakers, for they shall be called
[1:17:28] the children of God." There's, you know,
[1:17:30] we need more of them, friends,
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; more people who are who want to make
[1:17:34] peace and not strife.
[1:17:38] And out of this soil rich with the love
[1:17:42] of God, rich with the nutrients from
[1:17:44] reading his Bible, from spending time
[1:17:46] with the Lord, from soaking in and
[1:17:48] baking all the greenness out in the
[1:17:50] presence of the so and you spend time
[1:17:53] there with the Lord and suddenly out of
[1:17:55] your life blossoms and blooms of joy and
[1:17:58] peace and all of those roots of
[1:18:01] bitterness are gone. and and and and and
[1:18:04] now out of that soil you you find in in
[1:18:07] Galatians 5 it says the fruits of the
[1:18:10] spirit is love and
[1:18:12] joy and peace,
[1:18:16] longsuffering. How many want it?
[1:18:19] And goodness,
[1:18:22] faith
[1:18:24] and self-control. That's what it means.
[1:18:26] Temperance.
[1:18:27] You can control yourself.
[1:18:30] And and you know what? Here's the key.
[1:18:32] Let me just say this to you tonight as
[1:18:34] I'm just just bringing this down to a
[1:18:36] close.
[1:18:37] What the key is is that you don't have
[1:18:39] to manufacture them.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; Because real love can't be manufactured.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; You look at that word agape, agape,
[1:18:52] however you want to say that real word
[1:18:53] of what real love is. It is love that
[1:18:57] only comes through the nature of Jesus
[1:19:00] Christ. the humanly you couldn't
[1:19:03] forgive.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; Listen friends, there are certain things
[1:19:07] you can go through that humanly you
[1:19:09] could never say I forgive them for that.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; You could say it. That's a one thing to
[1:19:13] say it. It's another thing to mean it
[1:19:15] out of your heart.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; Can I just say that true perfect love as
[1:19:20] brother Brandham said when he goes
[1:19:21] beyond the curtain of time and said the
[1:19:23] only thing that'll be there is perfect
[1:19:25] love. So do whatever you have to do. Lay
[1:19:28] aside everything. get to the place where
[1:19:30] you can love your enemy.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; You can't do that. I'm just going to
[1:19:36] work it up, brother. I'm just going to
[1:19:37] keep on thinking the right thoughts
[1:19:39] about them and and don't, you know, push
[1:19:41] out the negative about everything that
[1:19:43] they're saying and everything they're
[1:19:44] doing. I'll just say the I'll just force
[1:19:46] myself and you could be a good Pharisee
[1:19:47] and we could be good Pharisees and good
[1:19:49] actors
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; and say, "Bless their heart."
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; But it ain't it that doesn't matter.
[1:19:56] What matters is that what's in your
[1:19:58] heart.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; And the only way to have that is through
[1:20:02] the Holy Ghost. It's impossible any
[1:20:04] other way.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; You know what the key is about those
[1:20:09] flowers, those fruits, is that you don't
[1:20:11] manufacture them. They grow and they're
[1:20:13] real. They're not artificial.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; That's why brother Adam says the
[1:20:17] greatest weapon God ever gave to man, he
[1:20:20] says, in in many places is love.
[1:20:24] You take an unbelieving husband, brother
[1:20:25] Adam says, and you take that wife, let
[1:20:27] that wife love love him through that.
[1:20:31] And he says even with that love can save
[1:20:34] that husband. And then brotherham says,
[1:20:36] I love how he says he says now it's
[1:20:38] really it's got to really be there. You
[1:20:41] ever caught how he says that?
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; You can't fake it. It's got to really be
[1:20:46] there.
[1:20:48] And all of those flowers, those flowers
[1:20:51] have fragrance and life and they're
[1:20:53] blooming. They're blossing. Not
[1:20:55] artificial. You know, artificial
[1:20:57] religion is like plastic flowers. What
[1:20:59] do you call those? Silk flowers.
[1:21:02] And they're not real. They look real,
[1:21:04] but there's no fragrance
[1:21:07] that comes out of their life. They look
[1:21:09] okay from a distance, but get up close
[1:21:12] and there's no there's really no life
[1:21:14] there. But when the Holy Ghost is inside
[1:21:18] of you, it flows out of your life
[1:21:21] naturally. Peace, love, joy flows
[1:21:25] naturally. You don't have to fake it.
[1:21:27] You just blossom. Oh friend, I don't
[1:21:30] know about you, but as I'm even
[1:21:31] preaching, I'm saying, "Lord, let it be
[1:21:33] out of my life."
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; Don't let me be just as brother Brandham
[1:21:38] says, a Pharisee. You know, Jesus had a
[1:21:40] word for people who acted wanted to act
[1:21:43] religious. They acted really good. You
[1:21:45] know what he called them? Actors. That's
[1:21:47] what the word Pharisee means.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; It means an actor. One who puts on like
[1:21:53] literally an actor. And and they they an
[1:21:56] actor puts on a show. He wears a mask.
[1:21:58] All the lights go down and and the mask
[1:22:01] comes off because they because they're
[1:22:04] just acting. That's what they're doing.
[1:22:06] This is brother Adam says, "You only try
[1:22:08] to act religious. You've got an
[1:22:10] artificial flower. But when the Holy
[1:22:13] Ghost lives on you, you don't have to
[1:22:14] act holy. Holiness comes out of you.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; How many believe that here tonight?
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; You don't just have to say that you
[1:22:24] love, but you truly love.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; You don't just talk about peace. You're
[1:22:31] a peacemaker.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; You carry peace wherever you go. Amen.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; You don't have to you don't have to uh
[1:22:40] manufacture joy, but the joy is your
[1:22:44] strength.
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; It just comes out of you. You love even
[1:22:50] when you shouldn't be able to love. As
[1:22:53] as as the prophet of God says when he
[1:22:55] goes beyond the curtain of time, he said
[1:22:56] they there was just such love. He
[1:22:58] couldn't even describe it or put it into
[1:23:00] words
[1:23:02] because why? You say, "Brother Matt,
[1:23:03] what is it?" It's all it is is God has
[1:23:06] bulldozed your your your old ten can
[1:23:10] alley
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; and he's planted in you the seeds of
[1:23:13] faith, the seeds of love, the seeds of
[1:23:16] joy, the seeds of patience.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; And and and the Bible says, "Let these
[1:23:22] virtues be in you and abound,
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; having been made a partaker of the
[1:23:30] divine nature."
[1:23:32] Friends, that's what I need is I need
[1:23:34] more of the divine nature.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; I don't need this nature. I'm done
[1:23:38] trying to beautify this nature. I'm done
[1:23:40] trying to improve my nature. I want the
[1:23:43] divine nature.
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; I I want it I want it to come out of me
[1:23:48] naturally,
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; not not not having to force it.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; Could you stand to your feet here
[1:23:55] tonight? Brothers, sisters, could you
[1:23:56] come? Musicians, could you come?
[1:24:02] Could you bow your head with me? Every
[1:24:04] head bowed, every eye closed.
[1:24:10] So, what does your house look like?
[1:24:15] What's your attic look like?
[1:24:19] What's your crawl space look like? I'm
[1:24:21] not talking about those places that you
[1:24:22] take everybody and let everybody see.
[1:24:29] talking about who who are we really call
[1:24:32] ourselves Christians, believers,
[1:24:36] but what does our house look like?
[1:24:40] Is it still that old ten can alley?
[1:24:43] Trash and stench and rats,
[1:24:48] darkness, bitterness, strife. Ain't it
[1:24:51] funny? I'm not saying old rats of of of
[1:24:54] of of, you know, of of alcohol and old
[1:24:57] rats of lust and old rats of cigarettes.
[1:24:59] That ain't what I'm talking about. I'm
[1:25:01] talking to Christians.
[1:25:03] I'm talking to believers. And your rats
[1:25:05] ain't alcohol. And say, "Brother man, I
[1:25:08] ain't got no rats. I got rid of them
[1:25:09] all." Really?
[1:25:13] What about jealousy?
[1:25:15] What about envy?
[1:25:18] What about faith?
[1:25:20] You got faith in your heart.
[1:25:23] What about love?
[1:25:26] Or has the Holy Spirit so bulldozed your
[1:25:30] old life?
[1:25:32] And maybe we'll just make that a request
[1:25:34] here to say, "God,
[1:25:36] bulldoze it."
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; I don't want you to try to remodel it.
[1:25:41] Don't want you to try to fix it up. This
[1:25:42] ain't a fixer upper, Lord. I I want you
[1:25:45] to bulldoze it from the ground. And I
[1:25:48] want you to build your mansion that you
[1:25:51] can live in.
[1:25:53] I want you to tear down that old ten can
[1:25:55] alley. And don't leave anything, Lord.
[1:25:59] Don't leave anything standing. Tear it
[1:26:02] all down. Send the wrecking ball of the
[1:26:04] Holy Ghost and and and tear out every
[1:26:07] corner. Tear tear out every every space
[1:26:10] that any place I've given the devil.
[1:26:12] Lord, dig it all up. Excavate it. Take
[1:26:15] all of the ground. Lord, I I I want to
[1:26:18] say here tonight, I'm not going to
[1:26:19] settle for an artificial religion. I
[1:26:21] don't want artificial flowers. I want
[1:26:24] real flowers that blossom.
[1:26:27] Real flowers that out of the character
[1:26:30] of my heart, it there's a fragrance that
[1:26:32] comes from my life.
[1:26:34] There's flowers of the spirit that bloom
[1:26:36] all around that all those who are around
[1:26:40] me
[1:26:42] can smell the fragrance of Christ.
[1:26:46] Oh, is that what you want, my brother,
[1:26:48] my sister? Yes, Lord. You see hands up
[1:26:50] all over the building. My hands are up,
[1:26:52] Lord. That's what I want, Jesus. I want
[1:26:56] to get rid of my rats.
[1:26:59] I don't want to give no place to filth.
[1:27:02] I don't want to give no environment, if
[1:27:04] even one thing, God, one place in my
[1:27:07] life that I've left. You say, "Brother
[1:27:09] Matt, you don't know. What you're
[1:27:11] preaching is impossible." You're right,
[1:27:13] sister. You're right, brother. I know
[1:27:16] that
[1:27:18] it's impossible to
[1:27:20] to say, "I forgive you and I let it go."
[1:27:25] You could do it. You could say it, but
[1:27:27] it's impossible to take that feeling out
[1:27:30] of your heart.
[1:27:32] But I know a great physician who can.
[1:27:36] I know one who does heart surgery.
[1:27:39] I know one who starts at the ground.
[1:27:43] I know one who's who was ridiculed and
[1:27:46] mocked and spit upon and yet he opened
[1:27:49] not his mouth. He was reviled, the Bible
[1:27:52] says, but he didn't revile back.
[1:27:56] Oh, that's my Jesus. And I say, Lord, so
[1:27:59] live through me. Oh, I want it, God. So
[1:28:02] live through my life. So shine through
[1:28:06] my vessel, Lord God, that I can be
[1:28:09] reviled and not reviled back.
[1:28:14] All who
[1:28:16] love God will face persecution. That's
[1:28:19] what Jesus says. All who live godly will
[1:28:22] face persecution. I'm not talking about
[1:28:24] self, you know, as brother Brandham
[1:28:26] said, not not not self-made persecution.
[1:28:28] I'm talking about persecution for living
[1:28:30] a Christian life, living a godly life.
[1:28:33] All who live godly will face
[1:28:35] persecution.
[1:28:38] We live in a world, my brother, my
[1:28:40] sister, where just as I said, just from
[1:28:42] one moment, you can go from a manicured
[1:28:46] field, a manicured garden to just a
[1:28:48] field that weeds are growing in.
[1:28:52] Flowers aren't blooming.
[1:28:55] Oh, but God can start with his Holy
[1:28:57] Ghost bulldozer. Bulldozer every
[1:28:59] complex. Bulldozer every thought. Lord,
[1:29:02] I'm raising my hands. I invite you to do
[1:29:04] it. bulldo every thought, Lord God, that
[1:29:07] I I've dwelt upon that, Lord has created
[1:29:10] maybe a thought in my mind that
[1:29:11] shouldn't be there. Jesus, take it. I I
[1:29:13] bring it captive to you right now. I'm
[1:29:16] allowing entrance. I I'm I'm not putting
[1:29:18] up any blockades. I'm saying, "Come in,
[1:29:20] Lord. Come in. I'm not keeping you at
[1:29:22] the door. I'm saying I'm inviting you
[1:29:25] into every place of my life, oh God.
[1:29:27] Bulldo any pride. Bulldo any malice.
[1:29:30] Bulldo any jealousy. Bulldo any anger.
[1:29:33] bulldo any hatred. I don't want it there
[1:29:36] in my life. Oh God, I don't want to live
[1:29:40] with rats. I want to live with the Holy
[1:29:43] Spirit. The Bible types that Holy Spirit
[1:29:45] as a dove. Oh, and I want that dove of
[1:29:48] the Holy Ghost. Give me that nature, not
[1:29:50] the nature of a woof. Give me that
[1:29:52] nature of a dove. Oh, that dove, that
[1:29:55] nature of that lamb
[1:29:59] lays down its rights. Grant it Jesus I
[1:30:01] pray. Grant it Lord. Grant it Jesus.
[1:30:10] Yes Lord. Let's sing it just for a
[1:30:12] moment.
[1:30:16] Me.
[1:30:19] Feel me and feel
[1:30:23] me.
[1:30:25] That's your prayer
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; with you.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; With you,
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; holy fire,
[1:30:36] a holy fire,
[1:30:39] burn away
[1:30:42] my desires, my desires for anything, for
[1:30:47] anything
[1:30:49] that is not of you.
[1:30:54] Yes, Lord Jesus.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; I want more.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, is that your prayer? And less of me.
[1:31:05] Empty
[1:31:08] me,
[1:31:11] Lord.
[1:31:13] Fill
[1:31:16] me
[1:31:19] and fill
[1:31:21] [Music]
[1:31:23] me
[1:31:24] with you. With you.
[1:31:28] Could you gather to the front now? Come
[1:31:31] worshiping and singing. Holy fire.

[1:31:37] burn away.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; Burn away
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; my desire.
[1:31:43] I desire
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; for anything Jesus
[1:31:46] for anything
[1:31:48] that is not of you
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; and is of I will bless
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; I will bless more of you and less of me
[1:32:00] and less of me
[1:32:04] empty.
[1:32:06] [Music]
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; Oh, let's just focus on the Lord just
[1:32:10] for a moment.
[1:32:12] [Music]
[1:32:14] Oh, forget about what's around you. Just
[1:32:16] focus on him now. Fill
[1:32:21] me
[1:32:24] with you.
[1:32:28] With you. Sing it again from the top.
[1:32:31] Holy fire. Sing that now. Oh, could you
[1:32:34] raise your hands like a prayer? Oh,
[1:32:37] let's sing it to him like a prayer. Burn
[1:32:39] away Jesus my desires
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; my desires.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; Can you say this? For anything
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; for anything
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; that is not
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; of you
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; and is of me
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; than is of me.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; Oh, I want more of you
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; more of me.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:32:58] and less of me.
[1:33:02] Empty.
[1:33:06] Granted, Jesus,
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; Jes,
[1:33:15] [Music]
[1:33:27] with you. With you, with you,
[1:33:34] with you.
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; Say that again. with you.
[1:33:38] With you.
[1:33:41] With you.
[1:33:43] [Music]
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; Brother Mark Lowry, August 27th. So this
[1:33:49] is tonight, right, Brother Mark? This
[1:33:51] request here for Sister Deborah. That's
[1:33:53] tonight. Sister Deborah just had another
[1:33:55] MRI on her back. Please remember her in
[1:33:58] prayer. We're going to remember Sister
[1:34:00] Deborah. Amen. And just want to She's
[1:34:03] not here tonight, is she, Brother Mark?
[1:34:04] Okay. So, we're going to remember our
[1:34:06] sister. I just want to also add just to
[1:34:09] the prayer list just that you uh
[1:34:10] continue to pray for my dad. Uh just
[1:34:12] that he recovers his strength fully and
[1:34:15] uh he was looking good and feeling good
[1:34:17] and uh but just I think things just
[1:34:19] caught up to him there. So, we want him
[1:34:21] to be plenty rested up. Amen. And and be
[1:34:24] ready for uh for this weekend. Be
[1:34:26] praying for those services. We'll be
[1:34:27] there traveling and ministering there
[1:34:29] for brother David McGiri. I don't see
[1:34:32] any other written down needs. um here
[1:34:35] tonight just checking to make sure I'm
[1:34:36] not missing anything. Um don't think I I
[1:34:40] got anything that came in uh through the
[1:34:43] text. So if you got something you can
[1:34:45] send that to me now.
[1:34:47] Amen. Amen.
[1:34:51] Amen. Let's pray. Lord Jesus,
[1:34:54] Father, that's truly our desire that you
[1:34:58] would empty us, God. Burn away holy fire
[1:35:04] anything Lord that is not like you.
[1:35:06] Anything that is of us God Lord it's too
[1:35:10] late living too late of an hour Lord so
[1:35:13] close to home now. So close Lord to just
[1:35:19] Lord we can almost feel that we've seen
[1:35:20] a glimpse into that next reality of
[1:35:23] life. And it's so real Lord God. And I
[1:35:27] just want to say fresh once again. I
[1:35:30] want to lay aside every weight. I want
[1:35:32] to lay aside every sin that doth so
[1:35:35] easily beset me. And I want to run my
[1:35:37] race with patience. Oh God, I want to
[1:35:40] say once again, Lord, as your prophet
[1:35:43] said in the beyond the curtain of time,
[1:35:45] do whatever you got to do. Lay aside
[1:35:47] everything. Get to the place where you
[1:35:48] have perfect love. That's amazing, Lord.
[1:35:51] He didn't tell us to get to the place
[1:35:53] where we memorize scripture. Get to the
[1:35:55] place where you memorize a quote. Get to
[1:35:57] the place where you understand the vials
[1:35:59] and the thunders and the all of those
[1:36:01] things are wonderful. Lord, I'm not
[1:36:02] diminishing those. But God, what good
[1:36:05] are any of those things if we don't have
[1:36:07] the person of love, the person of the
[1:36:11] Holy Ghost. And if that love is really
[1:36:13] there, we'll love your word. We'll love
[1:36:15] coming to the house of God. We'll love
[1:36:17] our neighbor. We'll even love our enemy.
[1:36:20] We'll love living for you. Not dread it.
[1:36:22] It won't be a to a a burden upon our
[1:36:25] life, God. But that's what perfect love
[1:36:27] is.
[1:36:28] Perfect love tells the truth. Perfect
[1:36:30] love speaks only the truth. Perfect love
[1:36:34] lives for others. For that's looking
[1:36:36] eternity in the face.
[1:36:39] Perfect love doesn't allow a place to
[1:36:41] the devil for fear or anxiety. It
[1:36:44] doesn't give place through jealousy and
[1:36:46] complex,
[1:36:48] Lord. But perfect love, my Bible says,
[1:36:51] casteth out all fear. And I just want to
[1:36:54] raise a hand and say, let perfect love,
[1:36:56] let it dwell, let it live, let it
[1:36:59] breathe, plant in the soil of my spirit.
[1:37:02] Oh God, let it be saturated with the
[1:37:05] goodness of God. Lord, everywhere that I
[1:37:07] go, everybody that I meet, oh Jesus, I
[1:37:10] want that divine nature, Lord, that that
[1:37:14] inheritance, Lord, that you've given to
[1:37:15] the justified, to the sanctified, to the
[1:37:18] redeemed of the Lord. Given it, Lord,
[1:37:21] it's your promise. I pray, God, for our
[1:37:24] sister Deborah, Lord, God, with this
[1:37:26] back MRI one more time, Lord, I pray
[1:37:29] that you'd come and be the great
[1:37:31] physician. Touch my sister just now,
[1:37:33] Lord. This church binds together and we
[1:37:36] stand against an evil spirit that would
[1:37:38] try to cause suffering in any of one of
[1:37:40] your children's life. Oh God, that demon
[1:37:43] is just a tormentor. That's what is it's
[1:37:45] what he is. But we cast him out tonight
[1:37:47] by the word of God. I pray for each
[1:37:50] hand, Lord, that was lifted up here
[1:37:52] tonight. Every unspoken request, I pray
[1:37:55] that you'd come and be the need meter.
[1:37:57] Touch our pastor, Lord, my dad. I pray
[1:37:59] that you'd continue to restore, Lord,
[1:38:02] tenfold. Lord, if the devil took
[1:38:04] strength away and tried to uh take his
[1:38:06] strength, God, may you pour back into
[1:38:08] him tenfold, Jesus, I pray that he'd
[1:38:11] feel a rejuvenation and a a refreshing,
[1:38:14] Lord, like he's never felt before. Let
[1:38:16] it be, Jesus. I believe that you did
[1:38:19] great things, and we're rejoicing, and
[1:38:21] you're going to continue to do great
[1:38:23] things. And we give you thanks for that.
[1:38:26] Bless us now, one and all. We ask we
[1:38:28] love you Lord with all of our hearts in
[1:38:31] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Let's
[1:38:33] sing something just go ahead. Go ahead,
[1:38:36] brother King.
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; Peace of God.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; Peace of God
[1:38:44] cover me.
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; Oh cover me Jesus
[1:38:48] cover
[1:38:50] me.

[1:38:57] now.

[1:39:16] and only in you I am saved.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:39:25] Only in you I'm secure.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; That's the truth, Lord.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:39:34] only in you I find
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; I find peace. So cover. So cover me.
[1:39:44] Oh,
[1:39:46] cover me.
[1:39:48] Oh,
[1:39:50] cover me when I am hurting.
[1:39:54] Cover me when I'm not strong.
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; Cover me when I am going through the
[1:40:03] storm.
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; Cover me.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; Cover me when all seems hopeless.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; Cover me when my faith is gone.
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, let the peace that passes on I
[1:40:19] understand.
[1:40:22] Cover me. Come
[1:40:24] me.
[1:40:27] Come

[1:40:32] Oh peace of God
[1:40:36] cover. Is that your prayer? Oh, how many
[1:40:39] want that?
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; Let he only go through a storm. I'll
[1:40:42] reach my hand and say, "I want it, Lord.
[1:40:44] I take a hold of the peace of God
[1:40:46] tonight. Peace of God. Peace of God
[1:40:52] cover me all through the storm.
[1:41:00] Cover me.
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; Only in you. Sing it now. Only in you I
[1:41:08] am saved.
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; Oh yes, Lord. Only in you I am secure.
[1:41:20] Oh,
[1:41:22] only in you I find peace.
[1:41:27] So cover me.
[1:41:31] Oh,
[1:41:33] cover me.
[1:41:36] Oh, cover me when I am hurting.
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; Cover me when I'm not strong. Yes, Lord.
[1:41:45] Cover me when I am going through the
[1:41:50] storm.
[1:41:53] Cover me when all seems.
[1:41:57] Cover me when my faith is gone.
[1:42:01] Let the peace that passes on I
[1:42:05] understand.
[1:42:07] Oh,
