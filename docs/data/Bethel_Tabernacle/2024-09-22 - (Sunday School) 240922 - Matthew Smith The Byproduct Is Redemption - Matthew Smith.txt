========================================

e e e e e e e e e e e idea or thought that we would have had to but Lord that we would meet to hear a word from you Lord that you could speak to us and speak to our hearts bring forth uh a a word father that would encourage us that would energize us Lord that we could take hold of it and build our faith that our faith Faith could grow with the hearing of the word Lord we could recognize you in every chapter and verse as we go and father that we could fight back against the enemy in this day and age in which all the world has United to come against you father that we would stand against it all in your name so father we ask you would be here with us we invite you here Lord knowing that knowing and expecting you to come we ask these things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen if you would turn in our Bibles to um Genesis chapter 1 and verse 26 it's going to be continuation of last week's material um pull it up here Genesis chapter 1 verse 26 it says and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image and the image of God created he him male and female created he them and God blessed them and God said unto them be fruitful and multip mly and replenish the Earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the Earth amen y'all could be seated so as a quick review I hopefully we'll make it a quick review I am the worst when it comes to reviews um they're oftentimes not quick um but uh just quickly go over what we dis uh spoke on uh last Sunday how um this quote right this quote from marriage and divorce um we'll just read it again now it says remember Adam was both masculine and feminist in the original creation one but then he was separated by a rib notice but a byproduct and notice the only one of all God's creation of every animal and anything else she was the only one designed this way every other female was in the original creation every other female was in the original creation but Eve was not in the original creation see that had to be made that way we'll get to it after a while notice in this creation that she was not in the original but a byproduct and in this creation now I don't want to hurt your feelings but I want to tell you the truth and you just sit still you're doing nice okay so I would again like to point out that even brother branom recognized that when he said it a lot of people were going to choke on it right this is not something that is going to naturally you're just going to immediately read this and go ah this makes me feel nice right um and you know after spending a lot of time studying this it you know honestly what it it reminded me of is when Jesus said unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood you'll have no part with me right and so when all of his all these people who are following him packed up and left they said this guy's crazy he's a cannibal vampire weirdo and we're not going to follow this be elub this guy who's talking about some weird flesh eating cult that's hideous we're not going to be part of that right well but then when he turns to the to the 12 and says aren't you going to leave also notice what they did not say was that it didn't bother them right they didn't understand it very well either but what they recognized was in spite of the fact that it bothered them that they didn't understand it right even they might not have even recognized that they didn't understand it they just knew that it bothered them but they also recognized that this man had the words of eternal life and so they weren't going to walk away from that no matter how much it bothered them right and so that's kind of you know so many people will see a quote like this and it'll it'll get under their skin and they'll go oh well I'm not going to stand for this this is some sort of misogynistic you know woman hating thing and so I'm not going to be part of that like I'm I'm you know and so or or or and this is the other side of it and hopefully I'll get to this here in a minute what people will do is they'll read a quote like this and then very conveniently skip over and say I just won't think about that quote too much I'll accept all the message except for quotes like this right it's like well okay well now you also have a problem right you got to accept the whole message everything you know when brother Bram says it makes a statement like this he's he's not making the statement on his own authority he's making it because it came directly out of what we just read right came directly out of Genesis chapter 1 so it's not brother brandom's opinion on this point it's directly it is it is the word of God it's from Genesis right so you know when people want to reject a statement like this and say well I don't like that it doesn't make me feel good um what they're saying is Well there's part of the word that I don't want to accept that's right okay so but if you stick with it right it because the disciples were willing to stick with brother brandom or I'm sorry stick with uh the with with Christ rather am um sorry um um the uh because they were willing to stick with Christ even though he said something that bothered them ultimately they got to the Fulfillment of that scripture and it was something wonderful and beautiful they that that is still an ordinance in in the church today right it it it it has become you know it became a beautiful thing once they caught the revelation of what he was talking about but you got to stick with him through the misunderstanding to get to the Revelation right so um anyway so uh we talked about how um if my oh I got to turn it on first it works better if you turn it on um so we talked about this this is just a quick just a example right you could nothing too complicated um the uh if you uh but you know hopefully you can just at least see that the colors are just represented different different chemicals in the reaction and that you can track it all the way through and you can see that in any chemical reaction the byproducts are an inevitability of the reaction anytime you have a reaction you will have byproducts it is just the way it works right it is like saying I'm going to cut a 3ft 2x4 out of a 1ot 2x4 well guess what you're going to have a one or a 3ft 2X out of a 4ft 2x4 you're going to have a 1ot 2x4 at the end of that no matter how you want to do it right there's no way to do that um you will end up with two halves of this right well if Adam is the product and Eva is the byproduct the result she was the byproduct because she was in the original creation as well right when it said let us make man in our image male and female created he them Eve was in that right Eve was the female in that amen right and they and she's not an afterthought she's not a waste product she's not trash to be disposed of she's not something to be trotten on she is as much an intended result of this process as Adam was okay the the um right so uh when uh my notes here and the reason she was this way right is because they were both made together in the image of Christ or in the image of God now hopefully I'll be able to Circle back to this it's a point I want to dwell on a little bit um but we also talked about how you know when people in this modern society people don't want to be you know we see it as some sort of hideous thing right people get get you know get their hackles up when you say oh a woman is a byproduct of a man oh well how dare you I a strong independent woman don't need no man right and it we don't like the idea that a woman has to be subservient to a man because of you know a hundred years of of feminism that that teach us things that are literally contrary to the order that God has laid out and so it it it's built into the into the subconscious of of the modern world that anytime a woman is seen as submissive that it's seen as belittling or or or wrong and that we shouldn't stand for that but the reality is that it was the it was the way God intended that's the way God created people right and so of all the females that God created in the beginning the woman was the only one that was created as a byproduct she's the only one that makes her special right that means it was important that means it wasn't just something that we shouldn't just move past that we should think about that for a minute why was she intentionally made that way on purpose as opposed to all the other animals right and so you know we look at all these other animals in which you see a single male and a bunch of females right there's one rooster many hens one bull elk many cow elk one male lion many lionesses right why because these are all animals that were in which the females were in the original creation and they organized themselves this way and we can see here in Isaiah chap 4:1 and in that day seven women shall take hold of one man saying we will eat our own bread and wear our own apparel and let us be called by thy name to take away our reproach okay when when we move away from a society in which you have one man being the leadership of his home and one woman being the wife in that home and being submissive to the man's Authority when we move away from that when we move away from the marital structure that God laid out then we end up with a beast a beastial relationship structure we we end up with an animalistic system because after all if you want a pattern your if if the women want to be like all the other females in the original creation well then they're going to end end up like all the other females in the original creation right you're going to end up with a with a a system like we have today that the scripture prophesied would happen Okay we would end up with a system in which you have you know you have a a a small group of men who in that all these women chase after and you end up with a single motherhood epidemic that is breaking the family structure of the entire world right um and and the reality is uh okay we'll get to that in a second this thing's there we go all right what ends up happening is that because men and women were not designed to live this kind of way right because men were built to be the leaders of their homes and women were built to be able to depend upon their men as leaders and providers and protectors and be able to submit to that Authority and be comfortable in doing so and not afraid of what that man is going to do to her because we've gotten away from that system well it's no wonder that we're uh we're having massive mental health problems oh yeah right you know it's not a all right just some statistics and um so I I actually read this today um in preparation for this in so they did a study in which they showed that in N they compared the the uh teenagers and college age people um high school and college age uh people from 1936 to 2007 and what they found was that the children or the you know young people in that age range were seven or eight times more likely to be diagnosed with depression than in 1936 in 2007 they are seven or eight times more likely to be depressed than they were in 1936 okay in the last 25 years alone okay this is from the year 2000 to the year 2004 suicide has gone up 36% am okay any other disease any other major fatal disease and that went up in 36% in 25 years people would be ripping their hair out trying to figure out what is happening what what's in the food what's in the water what is in our environment that's causing this kind of massive spike in in in fatal mortality right like mortality rates it's not okay um we know that mental health has declined over the last 100 years we know this it is you like researchers have been able to prove this unequivocably today if you walk into any crowded place right go to go to Walmart on a nice crowded day in Walmart and walk through Walmart and just know you can just know because based on statistics that when you walk through Walmart every third woman that you see will be diagnosed with depression one out of three one out of three women are diagnosed with depression one out of four are diagnosed with diagnosed with an anxiety disorder am okay that's a problem that's a massive problem think of any other disease and think yeah at any given point one out of three you know people are going to be diagnosed with that disease and we call that a massive problem right um and we wonder why are women anxi have uh oh this is another another statistic I don't have the exact I didn't have time to pull the exact number on this but one of the things that they found with the um explosion of the transgender movement right you know men having confusion and thinking they're women has been a problem for a long time that's not a new phenomenon per se though it might be a little bit more prevalent today it was always kind of known to exist but young girls thinking they're boys is kind of new it's it has exploded in the last year to the point where we're talking like you know 10,000% increases in in reported incidents of this happening why why is this new thing suddenly happening out of the blue and if you if you look at the if you look at the um what they call comorbidities right where they say all right here's a girl who is been clinically diagnosed with gender dysphoria what else was going on in her life well typically one of the core fundamental princip like things that is you that is uh shared across all of these cases is that there are young girls who have severe issues with um uh uh lost the lost the word um like uh um insecurity body insecurity which by the way is also this same pattern follows the U self harm epidemics that we've seen it follows the um anxiety and eating disorder epidemics that we've seen and they all have share the exact same coties so it's it's not a Myster like it's what we're seeing is that we're is that these mental health problems where we're seeing insecurities and anxieties and depressions and all of these things attacking people in this Modern Age that didn't happen a 100 years ago and it's almost as if it's almost as if the structure that God set up in which a man a headship could make his wives and his wife and his daughters feel secure and protected and provided for and safe and and and when she's feeling miserable about herself he can he can be the Romantic one to make her feel better and feel desired and wanted and pretty this this is what a man does this is what his purpose in life is to do right like this is what drives a man I mean because why cuz he's made in the image of God and what God did was that when his bride was feeling rejected he made sure he got crucified to make her feel forgiven right because because God is romantic God is the most romantic person that has ever existed oh yeah right and when a man is who is made in the image of God is operating in the way that he was intended to be intended to operate amen he's going to fulfill all of those needs in his wife and in the and and and he's going to be that headship for his daughters and be the pattern of the men that she's supposed to seek after right and he's going to fulfill those needs for his daughters so that you don't deal with these problems yeah right I mean sure every every woman's going to feel insecure but that's why she has a man to help her feel secure right like you know I you know and and likewise young men or or just men in general only function correctly when they're have a responsibility of a wife and a family to provide and protect right when men have a purpose of being then they perform well right they will go to work when they feel like they have a wife to take care of right when they have children to take care of they will go to work and they will provide because they bet they there's something inside that makes them do it right there's it's not a so look in in in in suicide statistics 80% of suicides are men 80% and they have gone up radically over time and I guarantee you I guarantee you and because we have the data on this that the vast majority of the men who are committing suicide are doing it when they lose their family yeah when they no longer have a family to provide for and protect when they are removed from their god-given role and responsibility when they no longer have someone to lay their life down for then they have no purpose of being and it's not a mystery because even God didn't want to exist without a bride even God said my existence is pointless and meaningless unless I have a bride right so when we when we blow up the nuclear family and we say well we're not going to pattern our lives and our marriages and our lifestyles after the word of God after Humanity was designed to be it's not a mystery why we're suddenly dealing with all these mental health problems it's not a mystery why I mean look we're designed where our brains are wired to operate in a certain kind of environment if you take a fish out of the water and put them in a bucket full of chocolate pudding he's not going to function correctly right if you take humans out of the environment and the structure in which they were designed to be they're not going to function correctly they're going to be depressed anxious and suicidal and I didn't mean to get off on that as long as as I did but um I but it all wraps back I want to I want to pick up Ephesians chapter 5 here I'm going to read read it very quickly um you don't have to turn because I I have very little time left and I want to keep keep moving here um so Ephesians chapter 5:22 it says wives submit yourselves to your own husbands as unto the Lord for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body therefore as the church is subject unto Christ so let the wives be to their own husbands in everything okay why why why does this this did Paul say this because he's he's recognizing that that that that Adam and Eve were patterned after Christ and the bride right that's who Adam and Eve were patterned after because before the foundation of the world there was a lamb slain right and if there was a slain lamb then there was redeemed of that blood as well right you you're not going to slay a lamb unless there's something to slay a lamb for right so if Christ existed before the foundation of the world and so did the bride okay where was job before the found you know when the sons of God Sayang for for joy you know where um and so because they're meeting that same pattern therefore we don't we don't look at God and say well God you have to submit to my authority as the church no we submit to God as the as Christ is the masculine Christ is the dominant figure in the or the the um the um uh the the leadership he's Christ is the headship in this relationship and so the church submits to the headship not the other way around and likewise wives should submit to their husbands because he's the leadership in the situation when there's a great quote I don't I didn't have it with me it just came to me now where brother bandham says you know talking about a a woman trying to take leadership over a man and he tells that he says boys you better not let her she'll uh he said she'll rule over you if you let her and she'll hate you for it okay women are not designed to be leaders be in leadership positions in the home they would prefer the man to be the leadership position right but if in so if you make her be the leadership position guess what she'll do it and she'll hate you for it right and so the wife would rather allow the man to be the leader allow him to be the hero right allow him to be able to to to lay his life down for her it makes her feel loved okay in in verse 25 it says husbands love your wives Jesus Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of Water by the word uh What uh yeah um I'm going to kind of skip down a little bit um for this cause for no man shall ever yet um hate his own flesh but nourisheth and cherisheth it even as the Lord the church for we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones for this cause shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall be joined unto his wife and they too shall be one flesh this is a great mystery but I see but I speak concerning Christ in the church nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself and the wies see that she reverence her husband now I would like to point something out here it says wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the Lord and then in verse 25 it says husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it hm that's interesting the Commandment to the women is to submit and the Commandment to the men is to love hm all right so I had somebody there there's a kind of a thought experiment that you can do ladies when you next time you have a a minute with your man ask your husband whether he would rather be loved or respected okay and I guarantee you I I I say guarantee nine times out of 10 okay vast majority of the time the man is going to is going to say that's the same thing you I do not feel loved if I do not feel respected right when a woman woman respects her headship that's how she makes him feel loved right and she's got three verses Paul gives her three verses of commentary on love on how to a woman can properly make her man feel loved and he gives him like eight verses right because for her it's simple just submit to the headship that's what you do to make him feel cared for for him he's got a that's a little bit of a different project because now is it's it's not as simple as that it's you better provide you better protect you better go a whole bunch of extra miles right there's you better sacrifice why because it's all going back to the relationship of of Christ and the bride and it notice here that here's here's Paul saying that there's a great mystery in all of this he says um this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ in the church so here's Paul saying recognizing that when we're talking about marriage and divorce we're not talking about human Affairs per se we're talking about spiritual Affairs that are only playing out in the natural world right because the natural types the spiritual what we see in the natural world 100% is a reflection of what's happening in the spiritual world when we see a modern environment in which the authority of men is completely cut down right that the men are no longer expected to be leaders in their homes then it's not any wonder why God is removed his leadership over the church okay it's the same spirit it's doing the same thing okay what and so when we do not pattern Our Lives after the word and we do not pattern our marriages after the word then guess what it's not going it's not a reflection of of what God intended it's not going to be um it's going to be a direct reflection of our spiritual well-being right and when we there's a lot of times that women or our sisters want to go well I'll obey I'll I'll uh you know submit to the authority in my home in all the places that I like and the places that I disagree with that I don't think are very healthy I'm just going to ignore that right the parts of the parts of my husband's Authority that I agree with I'll I'll submit to and the parts of my husband's Authority that I disagree with will just sort of H bypass and you'll see this I man people you keep open your eyes and people you'll see it a lot right A lot of times you know you you get you'll get parents with differing opinions on how to raise children and so kids learn pretty quick go to Mom for this and go to Dad for that right well no ultimately what should be happening is when you go to mom she's going to say what did your father say right there's not going to be a difference of opinion and I understand there's miscommunication and she thinks one thing and he thinks another thing and they didn't get together first on the topic so you're going to get different outcome that's not what I'm talking about right but every kid knows that you can absolutely get a a difference of opinion based on who you go to well ultimately there should be a Unity there and why it's because a lot of times look when when a woman is willing to submit to the authority everywhere but the places that she disagrees with it's it's it is a woman saying I will wear my long hair for the glory because it is it is it is the glory it is my glory and it speaks of my headship but I'm going to trim the split ends off because I don't like that part yeah right I mean brother brandom said you don't take scissors of your hair and so when you're saying well I don't like this part of my hair so I'm just going to clip the ends off because I mean I think it would be healthier if I just you know okay that's great but what you're doing is you're trimming the authority the the edges of the Authority off of your husband where you don't like it right that's the spiritual that's spiritually speaking that's what you're doing and it's going to show a lot of places in that marriage right once you start looking at it in that angle suddenly you start seeing all the places in which that woman doesn't respect her husband where she doesn't agree right and it's I know that's hard right nobody likes to hear that kind of preaching I guarantee you nobody likes to hear that kind of preaching right and if you notice what brother brandom said you know sit still I know this is going to be hard the preacher doesn't like preaching that kind of material either I promise am right no one likes to hear that why because it hits us where we live it hits us where it hurts but it's a but it's because it's ultimately what it's saying is listen we we have to line up with the word everywhere and that's that's the hardship in this day and age it's not about well getting you to be a complete apostate it's getting you to compromise one tiny percentage right he getting you to compromise one tiny percent you know it's it throughout the entire Bible we can see that God recognizes sin as spiritual fornication that's how he sees it okay and if I say well you know there's how many hours in the day 24 hours in a day and there's 365 days in a year that's you know how many thousands of hours of a year if I spend one hour out of every year having an affair does that make me a bad person really I mean Don't Judge Me based off of my worst 1% look at all this 99% that's really great no that 1% makes you a wretch right that 1% destroyed your relationship yeah it's 1% ruins everything right you know if if if you're start you know sit down to a fine meal you know surf and turf whatever I don't know I I like I like my mom's red chili cheese and chiladas if I got a big old plate full of that and I'm scarfing it down it's 99% delicious and 1% cyanide right it's delicious and deadly right it you know we this idea that we can compromise 1% no it's not okay right that 1% will ruin you and you know because the the relation
