lord that your hand will just continue to be on them lord and give them direction in your great and holy name lord forgive us for any forms of unbelief lord any thoughts that's not like your thoughts any ways that's not like your ways in the name of jesus christ we pray that church say amen amen amen if you have your bibles let's turn to genesis the third chapter no i'm sorry let's let's go to genesis 1. appreciate all the songs amen genesis chapter one we're going to read a familiar verse scripture if you want to say a bright scripture you know that it took a end-time prophet to come and open up to us and let us see what god was thinking amen amen genesis 1. let's start at verse 26. the bible says and god said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea over the files of the air over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth verse 27 so god created man in his own image in the image of god created he him male and female created he them and god blessed them and god said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the father of the air and over everything that moveth upon the earth my that's a full dominion right say over everything that moves oh my what almighty god let's go to um luke chapter seven luke chapter seven let's start at um let's just start at verse verse uh eight luke seven and eight and we know this is the centurion talking with jesus for i also am a man set under authority having under me soldiers and i say unto one go and he goeth into another come and he cometh and to my servant do this and he do it when jesus heard these things he marveled at him and turned him about and said unto the people that followed him i say unto you i have not found so great faith no not in israel and they that were sent returned to the house found the servant whole that had been sick amen lord bless reading of his word you can have your seats my thought by the grace of god and i desire your prayers and your pull my thought tonight is god's expectation you know and you know if you if we could just think for a second that the word expectation i don't literally have the definition before me but we know what it means to be expecting something that means you're looking for it and all the time as believers we're expecting something from god because his word is his word his word can lie he can't take it back it'll perform what he sent it out to do so we're always expecting of god but i kind of want to turn it around tonight and let's look at god's expectation i want you to know as a as a member of god's family that he is also expecting something out of you you know as a parent you pour in and pour in to your family or pour into your children or pour in you know to that life to a place to where you're expecting something back from all that you're giving out amen and we know that god he's he's looking upon his creation and he knows what you're supposed to be he knows what you're supposed to produce and he's not going to stop until he get it hallelujah so god i want you to catch this now church god is expecting something out of you so this is not a day where you could just lay back and say praise god i'm a christian no the father is pouring all into you so he can weep back out of you amen you know the scripture says that he's gonna uh reap in places he hadn't sold so who's doing the showing you are hallelujah and god is expecting amen but you know if you go back to the book of genesis you know and we look at god his his relationship with man and when god created man the bible says he says let us make man in our own image after our likeness let them have dominion god's expectation of you was not to be the head nor the tale his expectation was for you to be a ruler hallelujah for you to have dominion amen if i can make it simple dominion over your finances hallelujah dominion over your body dominion over your mind hallelujah dominion over the problems that may easily beset you according to the scripture you're supposed to dominate all right hallelujah why don't we always hallelujah run to god and say lord i need you this i need you that he already is expecting you to be in a position he's expecting us to be in a place where we shouldn't even have to come and ask him oh my do we ever think like that that god is looking at us and he's saying why are you asking me i've already given you dominion i've already given you a right church you have a birthright to ask for what you asked for hallelujah look he says and i hope this encourages you tonight and by god's grace i ain't gonna be long y'all know i'm about to close but look he says now this this this is what he gave to men he said now we're creating his image and his likeness and let them have dominion over the fish hallelujah over the sea so i according to the scripture i got dominion over water all right i said about these ain't no fish but i got dominion over it according to the scripture i got dominion over sharks the meaning of whales everything that's in that ocean hallelujah it has to obey my voice in the right context come on with me now church he says uh and over the fowls of the air and over the cattle and overnight we've seen that in the prophet's ministry hallelujah at a time where he was going to pray for somebody and and and and and he he left his gun in the car and there was a killer bull don't we understand god put him in that position god put him in that place because he was expecting something to come out of that prophet in that moment that he didn't even know that he possessed but god knew it was there god knew hallelujah in the right moment in the right time he'd be able to speak to creation just like he did in genesis 1 26 sin did not change the word sin did not change the promise of god hallelujah and right there in that moment god would allow us to get in certain situations certain places certain positions just because he's expecting something has nothing to do with you and your failures it has to do with what god's seen before the foundation of the world let me say it like this god knows the capability of his seed he knows what that seed can do he knows the progression of that seed he knows the power of that life and that life is in you he's not expecting anything less but a child of god amen he don't put you in a position hallelujah that you might fail no he's looking for himself he's looking for those traits of that seed to come out of you in that situation now look i had to learn this god can easily stop things but he'll let it go on because he's expecting a certain kind of character so he'll let trials and tribulations and sickness and heartache and pain and all these things come upon you because he's expecting you to come over here he's expecting you to overcome it hallelujah he's expecting you to mature into his now i'm about to say something they're gonna shake your boots he's expecting you to come into his divine nature [Music] oh my he's expecting when he sees you to see all of his attributes to see his character to hear his own voice think about the church let's look at the level of god's expectation when he created adam there was no doubt in what he created god wasn't doubting adam in one bit one form one in nothing god was so confident in what he had created he just turned adam loose and say go do what you do hallelujah that was god's expectation god knew when he created adam he created an amateur god so what did he do he put him in a position where he could be a god so he told adam because of god's expectation he said adam i will bring all the animals to you and you name them why because god knew he had the ability to do that he had god's mind god's thought pattern he wouldn't name anything that god would name it and you know hallelujah that same expectation that god had trickled down through the ages hallelujah and you know he put he put brother branham in a position hallelujah it seemed like it was something hard a tough day he left his god he was going to pray and all these things and he saw a killer bull coming his first reaction was to shoot it but that was what god was expecting god wasn't looking for no gun to be fired that day hallelujah well let me let me let me backtrack a little bit no his first the prophet's first expression was to run god ain't looking for runners no more his seed is not a runner his seed is supposed to have dominion hallelujah you're supposed to stand right up to it and be what god made you all right now i'm not boasting hallelujah i'm just talking about what god said hallelujah in church he wanted to run but then he looked hallelujah how far the fist was and he knew he could make it his next instinct as a man was to shoot it but god made sure he left the gun in the car what was god expecting god was expecting him to be genesis 1 26 so god would allow you to get in places so you can go back to your origin so you can go back you can fulfill his expectation wow hallelujah god's not looking for us to operate as a carnal human being he's looking for us to be what he created wasn't looking for a track star he wasn't looking for a marksman he was looking for his child he was looking for that god he created amen and that's what he's looking for when you go through things that's his expectation hallelujah and look the prophet didn't even know that was in him so god put him in position so he could come out because god wasn't expecting anything less he created man to have dominion over a killer bull oh and this bull was untamed let me tell you something church sin did not change what god is expecting he's still expecting you to be his son to be his daughter to be a god child and are you looking at the prophet in that moment what happens god begins to cover him god begins to come down and bruise over his creation again just like he did in genesis hallelujah amen and that seed of faith that was laying dormant there it began to come out in this place hallelujah why the light hallelujah and the life of that seed began to connect and all it could do was produce the supernatural just like he did when he said let there be now you look in that moment what was happening the prophet began to speak hallelujah and as he spoke everything he said was just like let there be what was happening that was god's expectation church i want to encourage you you can't be nothing but what god wants you to be and what he wants us to be is children of god [Applause] he don't want us to just settle for a plumber or baker or a teacher or whatever he wants you to be his child wow amen although the prophet was good at hunting he was good at boxing he was good at all these things but that wasn't what god created amen hallelujah the fall made him a good hunter are you with me that wasn't god's original uh concept of why he made him he didn't create the prophet just to be a good marksman he didn't create him to be a good herdsmen or a gamesman no he created him hallelujah to fulfill his expectation and that's why we are created to fulfill god's expectation and little church even after adam fell god he made a way where man could stay in that channel hallelujah because god continually expected something from man so look at the grace of god god's never going to lower his standards for you and i know he's expecting the greatness of the great to come out of you hallelujah through every trial through every situation he knows what's inside there you know i was telling you my daughter was riding down the road and you know i was thinking about a farmer you know when a farmer he plants his seed there's a certain kind of life he's looking for hallelujah somebody talked to me that that when that farmer plants apples he's not looking for oranges he knows exactly the life which he hallelujah it doesn't matter how dark the dirt is how rich the dirt is he's worried about that life that he planted coming forth there's a season there's a time that he's looking forward to bust through all that dirt and be what he planted he's expecting something whether it rains hard whether it rains tough he's still expecting something hallelujah whether it's snows oh yeah where the ice comes down he's still expecting something in that season churchill you don't want to be a person just because you feel like it's out of season you don't give god what he wants cause he already broke that chain remember he walked up to a fig tree and it looked like he was out of season but that fig tree didn't realize it was god saying give me some of you amen amen he was expecting figs should we say bro jesus wasn't a season we were dealing with god we were dealing with the one who created the tree and because the tree in that moment because it was caught in traditions hallelujah it couldn't give god what he wanted god cursed the tree why because he was expecting things what about you tonight what is god expecting holy he's expecting us to fulfill his word through the channel of faith hallelujah but let's read a little bit more oh my i hope you're encouraged tonight see even in that thought let me go back even in that thought he's just dealing with the prophet we're trying on beings and god loves to show us that it's the soul of man that counts although your spirit is good your body is good but who you really are is in your soul so a lot of times god will put you in places so the real you can come out wow hallelujah let's go back to it amen the first thing the prophet said i can run that was his body amen next thing he said well maybe i can shoot it that was his spirit hallelujah but then he said he felt the nature of god come down he felt the love come down and he began to talk to creation what was happening he was connecting with that gene sheet of god he was connecting in the soul realm hallelujah and in his soul he was a god so he began to talk like one he said i'm a servant of god you're a creature of god i got to go pray for another servant now you go back over there and lay down why did it happen that way because god was expecting that to happen god is constantly through the scriptures reminding his children who they are by his expectation he had to constantly do that because we're living in a body of death and sometimes the body of death it clouds out what's really on the inside holy he had to do that with abraham hallelujah he had to tell abraham you're the father of faith hallelujah abraham didn't even knew it but but but he began to tell abraham about genesis 1 26 he said there are nations inside of you hallelujah your seed is going to shine like the stars it's going to be like the sun he said you look as far as the east to the west the north or the south so shall your seed be what was he doing he was putting him under his expectation and that was a growing process because all abraham could see was his failure hallelujah so god will continuously hallelujah put him in a position where he would fail but god's expectation didn't change that's the grace of god but we constantly fail god but his expectation of us never changes because he knows what you're capable of hallelujah abraham brings light alone they fuss and they fight light goes into sodom and now god says abraham i'ma give you a glimpse of who you are hallelujah i'm going to give you a glimpse of what's really on the side of you he says i want you to take 318 untrained servants and go down there and whip them kings up real good why because jesus said you're supposed to have dominion over the fish over the sea over the cattle and everything on the earth amen amen oh my so abraham goes down there he whips up on the kings real bad take lot back hallelujah lot was never any benefit for it hallelujah so why why lie why was god hallelujah using abraham to go get lot because god had to show hallelujah who he really was through us amen hallelujah right there in abraham he's showing that he's a kinsmen redeemer because even when he's wrong god made a way that lot could be redeemed amen it was his fault that he was down in sodom he chose that way but god's expectation the grace of god coming through him through abraham saved the man in his wrongdoing amen how do you respond when people do you wrong he's expecting you hallelujah to be a chip off the old block and we know the scripture says the sins of sodom vex light righteous soul and when you read about lot there was nothing righteous about life what made him righteous abraham's prayer amen because abraham was constantly interceding for him he let the scripture the scripture say that a righteous person can make a a wicked person righteous holy and the scripture also says whoever sins you remit they'll be remembered whoever sends you retain they'll be retained hallelujah that's god's expectation holy you know their problem with jesus was that jesus wasn't just doing good miracles but he was saying i'm god and that's the problem people have with this message because we act like we're children of god hallelujah you notice they don't have a problem with brother branham gift they don't have a problem with the healing line and all these things but when it gets down to god's thoughts and the mind of god that's when people have a problem [Applause] when you can look in the scripture and you say i'm supposed to act like this i'm supposed to do that because god is a holy god he's a righteous god i want to be his expectation god's expectation of you and i is holy amen his expectation of you and i is faithful righteous oh powerful that's his expectation i hope this stirs you up just enough harley to come back in here sunday on fire all right wrote up the brother jay said come on pastor preach don't y'all know god be expecting that god be expecting us to come and pull on the word because when you pull on the word you pull on him we know the prophet god say he want to give it to you more than you want it oh my oh my listen okay look to run this back down he says over the earth over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth now listen he already said that that we were created as images likeness you know we have demeanor the fish so on and so on and all that but then you go on verse 27 saying god created man in his own image in his image of god created he him male and female created he them and god bless them hallelujah now we're going to slap the devil in the face right quick here according to the lord's expectation i'm supposed to be blessed you ain't supposed to be jealous of my blessings harley you ain't supposed to be looking at me all sideways hallelujah when the blessings of god is flowing through me hallelujah all right you're supposed to say amen to the word hallelujah i'm not talking about what i'm preaching i'm talking about my life hallelujah so if i can see the blessings of god upon you i'm supposed how are to say amen say lord why me why them why this happening no we're supposed to say amen because god said let there be let there be what blessings flowing through them amen and we look at people and we see that they're blessed and god bless everything they touch us and the spirit of jealousy rises up that ain't god expectation god's expectations for you to be grateful hallelujah that you can see the blessings of god you can experience them and you if i'm blessed and you fellowship with me you bless you might be saying give me or give me some of them blessing them you have not because you ask not holly half you know if i got it or not unless you ask me and if i ain't got it i can pray for it hallelujah look church god did not change his word everything he said about us still remains to the day let's keep reading everybody all right it never fails i come and say i'm just preaching a nice message tonight i ain't gonna sweat but that wasn't god's expectation god knew when i started talking about this thought some of you were gonna get on the edge of your seat and you were gonna start pulling hallelujah and everything that i had planned was gonna go out the window because you and your spirit you're saying talk to me tell me who i am keep keep preaching to me god lord keep showing me who i am lord i have more amens hallelujah see what's happening church in these kind of atmospheres hallelujah your theophany becomes real [Applause] it's not just a good quote that ain't your flesh saying hey man that's your word body so even though you may be sitting in this natural rim your theophany every time you come to church or every time you hear some good preaching it comes near hallelujah because he said that theology is saying he's talking about me and god's expectation is for you to know that you have representation in heaven how do you know that by your amends because remember the scripture says flesh and blood shall not inherit the kingdom of god so they hate your natural man saying amen i know that in my mind no that's the visitation of your theophany coming close to you tapping you on the shoulder hey man while i'm preaching run up on you and say say amen where's that nudge coming from are they coming from me hallelujah is there something pushing them amens out of you it ain't me doing it what is it it's your spiritual representation it's god's expectation hallelujah god sending those theophanies down saying all right it's a thirst night go stand in your position amen and i want i want you to know this church that your theophany is not sitting on your lap it's that attention amen because it cannot help hallelujah but worship in the presence of god that word body holy can't help but stand at attention and say amen to the word it ain't sitting on your lap hallelujah it's standing right beside you or in some of your cases it's behind you pushing you you know it's hard to get a man out of some of you your amen is a good swift nod jehovah is god he's the creator of all you got to be ashamed of yourself some of y'all provoked me to worship some of y'all provoke me to celebrate god hallelujah because i'm talking about his goodness and his expectation to me he's worth more than a god to me he's worth more than hallelujah some insignificant wink wow but he's a god of praise he's a god of worship holy adoration he's a god of thanksgiving and its expectation is for you to give it to him no matter how bad work was no matter how bad the children cutting up no matter how bad your sickness is god let you go through that so you can tap into his attributes even your sickness is for your good come on praise god your struggle is for you for your good do you realize when you get cut in a certain place when that skin grows back it grows back tougher and you know church we've been missing it earlier you know we we've been missing we get so scared with this covet and and all these things and you know the body is it's it's it's created in such a way where it develops an immune system there's something inside of you called a t cell hallelujah and what i believe i believe is the t cell the t cell is that cell that attacks germs you got something already in you that's attacking the devil [Music] start with a t now with a v oh my god somebody said brother jesus you taking you taking a vaccine i say for what so well you know you know you got to get vaccinated this and that i already been vaccinated that day on calvary i was vaccinated hallelujah from all my sickness amen they said well who did it hallelujah i got the bowman gilead hallelujah his name is jesus holier and it don't matter what stage of him you take it'll never make you weary or sick but it's always working for your good there ain't no expiration date hallelujah you don't have to take it by some certain time as soon as you as soon as you accept it it stays with you forever you gonna get this word tonight i don't know about you guys but i'm glad i'm saying church you might not believe this but i cut up the most when i come to church it ain't like that when i'm with my friends we laughing you know when i'm here hallelujah i'm just as free as a bird i can show y'all a video hold up my mama singing last last sunday on her birthday and she was singing uh uh on my way home i think it wasn't here on my way home fixed the g's like you said he would you know she was singing that song and the knock was just falling she was just saying i pulled her card out and i started saying that's my mama that's my mama singing mama [Music] amen y'all would've thought i'm crazy hallelujah but i know what she been through hallelujah and to see her live another day to be in church worshiping on a birthday that just does something for me hallelujah i remember my mama went to do a colonoscopy and when she did it they punctured her lungs and then from that time everything she ate was going into the cavity of her body and she didn't even know it the doctors didn't know it i was up in greenville preaching for brother berlin i think some of y'all were there holly y'all don't even know how my sister called me say mama got a fever of 108. i said oh lord i said we're going to pray so he my sister prayed different things and my sister got a famous shoe trying to take care of my mama now i'm talking about god's expectation god will let you go through stuff because he won't show you something so you know hallelujah she's she got a fever of 108 106 back and forth my sister putting putting putting towels on her head ice all the stuff trying to calm her down she goes back to the hospital hallelujah and as soon as they do an x-ray they realize they're a mistake but by now she has all the stuff inside the cavity but finally she finally hurled you got to a place where she could get some rest in that house you told my sister she said my sister answer andrew go home i'll be all right don't that sound like a believer with 108 fever i'll be all right and searching and then she laying in the bed and as she was laying in the bed hallelujah god talking into a dream of vision and she said right before her stood a man dressed in all white don't just sound like a good testimony hallelujah just think about a man standing before you in your vision or your dream dressed in all white y'all know the devil don't want all white now he's dressed there and all white and she said she was looking at him and she was burning up hallelujah she was looking at him he took a bucket he had a bucket and he took the bucket and healed for the splash he said don't do it and he splashes when he splashed her she woke up she's in the hospital tonight when he splashed her she woke up and her sheets were wet the bed was wet and her fever was gone she got a splash from god that was god's expectation earlier for her to get sick and then get a visitation from an angel amen god is in control john shouting john was all pentecostal brother and every time you come to church he shout the place down he shouts so much till the people start getting jealous and the people start saying you know like they're saying the message we're mature we got the word we're mature we have the word that's just too much emotion but brother john didn't care about john he shot the place down to the place they got mad old sheldon john was at his house he had a bunch of ladies at his house behind the mule brother matt he was plowing and the deacon's brother deacon and brother deacon came up and they said brother john the people complaining about you shouting too much isn't that a devil that same devil is alive today trying to quiet the church down when we got so much to shout about has anybody ever been sick and got healed [Applause] i don't know about you but that makes me want to shout yeah not diabetes once but twice not canceling my arm casting my lungs casting my brain hallelujah not not not just my eyes closed with my eyes going blind and y'all want me to be quiet in your church well i'm sorry i'mma be like shouting john i'm a shop and you know what i know some of y'all want to shout with me i'ma tell your secret you know why god brought me here tonight because his expectation is to get you out your seat his expectation is to stir you up hallelujah oh my sound john starts shouting they say they say they say brother john you're shouting too much in church don't get nervous don't buy the clothes he said you shout too much in church and you're making the people uncomfortable imagine that people are uncomfortable because you praise the lord you talking about a spirit looking at me while i shout judging me i wonder if it's real that ain't none of your business the only one that can determine whether it's real or not is god and the life i live when i leave here hallelujah if you ain't living right i said like they said sit down someway but if you living right and you feel like shouting i'm sure brother jason don't mind that's right hallelujah y'all might not believe this or not but jason got some of this in him isn't that he don't even have to tan he'd just come out during the summertime sean john started shouting they said brother john you shout too much in church we can't we can't have you coming disrupting church like that he said oh yeah the people say he said yeah they said yeah the people upset john john say look at all this land i got you say you see all his land he said yeah we see it he said god gave me this land he said i got all my children all my children in church my wife saved everything all my possessions god gave it to me he said you don't want me to shout in your church he said well hold on john said hold my mute i shout right here right in your face if you don't like it i don't need your church to dance with god that's god's expectation cause you don't have to be in these walls to give god praise you don't have to be in this building to give god thanks his expectations for you to worship him wherever you go but i know some of you ain't gonna do it because you control freaks you love having control that's why people don't want the holy ghost brother mad because they love having control so you can just sit there and be all nice your favorite scripture is and it was a still small voice but what i love about that scripture god told elijah he said go stand in the mouth of the cave and i'ma come pass by and the bible says and god started to move and god's moving started an earthquake so was god in the earthquake who started the earthquake i'm just saying not the scripture you might not believe it but who was he on mount sinai he was an earthquake and he said as he began to move hallelujah there was a win god's moving did all these things what was he on the day of rushing wind and also saying there was a fire the scripture says god is a consuming fire church all three of those manifestations was a manifestation of god moving but in that moment he wanted to talk to elijah in a still small voice but the earthquake was god the wind was god and the fire was god but in that moment hallelujah his expectation was to speak in a still small voice so don't give the don't say it's not god when you see somebody experiencing an earthquake but jason the reason why they don't like an earthquake in church is because you can't control an earthquake you just gotta sit there and ride it out you just gotta sit there and hold on till it stops that's the reason why people don't like a mighty russian wind because you can't control it a real real strong wind will blow you down look what it does to the ocean when it gets to going reason why people don't like a fire hallelujah because it burns up everything in its way and brings it back to its original condition but some people want to remain what they are and god was in a fire to burn up all that filth so you could go back to what he originally created you to be a ministry of brimstone and fire hallelujah that's why people don't want this message hallelujah because the prophet was speaking fire amen we got to stop doing this we're going to set people on fire one day they're going to come down here they'll be like hey we got to stop them people we got to stop them people they doing something in the land sure let me let me let me move forward listen church in in in luke chapter seven when jesus was talking to the centurion we know the story right we know the story right hey man i know some people in here look centurion he's talking to jesus he tells jesus i'm a man like you are when i say go to go and i say do they do you know on and on and on and then he tells jesus don't even go now when you go back and read those stories what i want you to realize is jesus is coming and it's intruding he's talking to him while he's coming he's telling jesus i'm just i'm that but then he says don't even come just speak the word only am i right that's what the bible says he's telling god you even have to come down this way just speak the word only but jesus can't resist that kind of faith he's expecting that he's been searching for that so that faith is drawing him in is pulling him in because god knows what he's going to say next holy so he's expecting him to say i'm a man of like authority like pastors like you are just speak the word holy so jesus get straight down that come here brother jesus gets down there he says i want you turn this way turn this way what's your name again bro caleb he gets right here and just say caleb is a centurion and he says he says that he says hey i'm a man as you all would like precious of of same passion same faith same authority all these things and you go back and read luke the seventh chapter jesus hello he receives that faith but the expectation is so high he turns him around he says i haven't seen this kind of faith in all israel that faith got the god of glory excited you can sit down i'm gonna read i'm gonna read it to you luke 7. let's let's let's just start at verse let's start at verse 8. luke seven today he says for i also am a man set on the authority having under under me soldiers and i say unto one go and he goeth unto another come and he cometh and to my servant do this and he do it when jesus heard these things he marveled he was expecting something he marveled at him and said he marveled at him and turned him about and said unto the people that followed him i say unto you this is it that's basically what he's telling everybody that's looking holly this is what i've been expecting this is what i've been looking for hallelujah somebody who knows who they are it's not just a song but it's a revelation this man knows who he is he turns them about and he's telling everybody look on him amen he said marvel to him to turn them about and said unto the people that follow him i say unto you i have not found so great faith no not in israel god's expectation listen church in john the third chapter when jesus was saying you must be born again and he went on he was talking to the disciples you know what he said to them he said marvel not right this is what i'm expecting i'm expecting the people to be filled with the holy ghost marvel knot in matthew i believe it's the um mark the 6th to 16th chapter verse 14 he said after he appeared into the 11st that sat down and ate me and upbraided them with their unbelief see his expectation was for the church to believe hallelujah so you look at jesus hands of people that didn't believe amen he couldn't take it because he knows the life of his seed you're supposed to believe the words so the bible says he abraded them for their unbelief what that word means to scold amen basically he set them down and gave them a letter and said look you guys are better than this you guys are better than this you're supposed to believe i can walk through a wall on and on and on church his expectation of you hallelujah remember he told the saints and i'm about to close he told the saints and he said let's pray let's pray and they went to sleep he said let's pray the will to sleep and then another place he told let's go over to the other side jesus stayed back and prayed they jumped in the boat until the storm started happening jesus came walking on the water hallelujah and they said oh it's the spirit oh it's a ghost lord if it's you jesus said one thing come he wanted to show them you still got dominion over the sea amen that word didn't change as long as you keep your eyes on jesus you are genesis 1 26 [Music] and as long as peter kept his eyes on christ he had dominion over the sea over the water he was walking on it just like the word of god said that was god's expectation that's why he allowed the storm to show peter who he is in the arms of jesus and in my closing in another place god's expectation church i don't know about you but he does me like this sometimes i remember i remember when i was first going full time in the ministry and i didn't want to go but god was expecting something so he started pushing me and pushing me and i was like so i finally accepted i went in quit my job took my pension from the city started evangelizing you know but i was i was just doing that because i felt like it was what i was supposed to do it wasn't a revelation if you're doing something it's not a revelation it ain't gonna last because you have to understand if god called you to something he's going to see you through it you know things got tough things got tight and you know what idea bro jason i went and got another job cause all my bills got backed up everything got backed up i went down to florida and preached preaching i was preaching doing youth meet for brother westco bill smiley brother jack and i get down there this is i've been probably evangelizing now about a year and you know things got tight bills behind everything behind and i get down and i sit in brother wesker office and he started telling me the testimony of how he became a full-time minister didn't even know what i was going through he said this was back in 77. this is like 2005 or 6 or something like that he would say god told me to go full time to ministry he said i had two years left to retire from the state he said and god told me to leave it and i'll take care of you he left it and god's been taking care of him ever since oh my church we got a currency that doesn't get old it's called faith hallelujah but he's talking to me about uh believing god full time in the ministry he's just telling me all these testimonies and stuff i didn't even ask him but god knew what i needed so i leave his office and you know i go and preaching we have church and everything is good and i i get on the road and the brother calls me he says hey brothers where you at i want to take you and your family out to eat i said man i'm gone i'm on 95 north he said what you doing on 95 north i said i'm going home i got to go to work he said work man you supposed to be a full-time evangelist so god's giving me reminders of what he expects from me even though i'm running from it hallelujah but now i got this job and all these things are going on church it was like that day that weekend it was like give brother diggs money week felt like a holiday everywhere i went somebody hey everybody how you doing oh praise god i really really that that weekend i really really got acquainted with benjamin franklin everywhere i turned around me and benjamin was looking at each other jesus christ ben you again i'm so glad to see you what's somewhere into me oh brother i sure appreciate that word oh man that was so good church and by the time i got home i gathered up everything i had listen everything i gathered up you know it was enough to bring all my bills currently and god rebuked me like he did like he did the disciples say if you trust me i'll take care of you but you went and got another job so he was showing me right there in that moment trust him but y'all know we hard hit it i still wasn't quite on board so he said okay i make a deal with god i say well lord you want me to go full time you got to do something you know god got a sense of humor god said okay you want me to do something all right i'm gonna close your eyes i'm gonna make sure you can't drive no truck i'm gonna make i'm gonna make i'm gonna make it so easy and so simple your boss gonna fire you because you want to go to the eye doctor and it seemed like the safe thing to do let the man go to the eye doctor because something wrong with his eyes and he's driving a truck with 70 000 pounds on it wouldn't you want that man to be able to see but my boss said you go to the eye doctor you're going to be looking for another job huh that don't even make no sense and just like he said i went to the eye doctor and i got fired and you know what who that man was it became a reality that day because you know what jokingly i used to call him pharaoh i come in that morning what you got for me today pharaoh he really became the manifestation of pharaoh fired me for trying to see and you know the grace of god the grace of god was god let it go on for at least a month and a half y'all don't believe it two witnesses back there amber after they saw me i was going down to florida to preach for brothers for brother smiley which i was trying to get out of it which he couldn't see me he was like man come on man you know we pray by the goddess and i'm like man i can't see so anyway we drove down there i got to the house they're like what's wrong with these eyes sister lewis said we gonna bind this devil up right now let's pray hardly but i had to go through something yeah see god had to let it go on as long as he did because he knew if i would have got my eyesight right back i don't want to got another job hallelujah so he let it go on and on and on and on until i got to a place where i just sit at home i say lord you know about this before the foundation of the world i say lord you knew this was going to happen he put me in this place to let me see his expectation and you know how i got healed i accepted his plan i was sitting in the house i said lord if this is your will for me to go full time in the ministry i accept and that was the last time my eyes ever closed like that they stayed open that whole day the next day the next week the next month all the way up to now just by me accepting his plan by faith just by me accepting god's expectation of me but you know i had my own reservation i'm saying okay lord i i'm gonna do it i'm gonna accept it but hey i'm gonna survive i'm gonna you know lord i need some i need some dinero and just just so have god is just just just know what he doing right church he know what he's doing i'm trying to close but maybe somebody needs this because you hold him back on god's expectation he has something he's expecting of you and you running from it or you holding back and you know church i just so happened my sight came back and i had a meeting i had to go preach in tennessee an anniversary meeting so thursday to a sunday i was well arrested so i could do it and you know i started preaching and on the the friday night the pastor said hey church we're going to take up a special offer for brother diggs because you know i was thinking in my mind how are we going to he said we're gonna talk about special offer he said he's evangelist i'd have been an evangelist avengers don't get a whole lot of money out there so we're gonna take a special offer you say he said he said to church when you say pastor where we gonna get it from pastor said we're gonna get it from a child pockets i love what my pastor said he'll come do a missionary offer and people be tight on their pocket you know he said we we gonna take up all my brother song so missionary offer and people put in a little hundred dollars or whatever it is send the plate up and all we collected is a hundred dollars and perhaps say look i need your money y'all won't believe brother has to do that with you but he don't play when it comes to the things of god and then he said i know y'all thinking right now brother brown never made pull for money he said i ain't brother branham and you know what we did we dug a little deeper and we blessed the people hardly you know what was happening that was god's expectation and you know at this church i'm i'm trying to close at this church the brother talk about offering and again hallelujah what was god doing god was showing me this is what i'm expecting of you but if i'm expecting it i'm gonna take care of it they talk about offering that was just like they saying that in the in the rich parts of london it was so delicious it was so delicious that it took care of everything i say here i mean yeah everything i was like oh praise god like god got me hallelujah now he says like that all the time but hey if god is doing something hallelujah he's expecting you to believe him come on musicians i'm closing the prophet god said the the unpardonable sin is for you to disbelieve god's word he said if you disbelieve god's word you make him out to be a liar and remember church like i said remember they were in the storm this last example by god's grace i'm trying to close remember they were in the boat jesus in the honda part of sleep storm water coming in the boats rocking back and forth and they up they're hollering oh one in the boat oh we're gonna die oh and jesus in the boat what you crying for if jesus is in your life he's expecting you to have dominion how to be fruitful multiply and replenish this earth you remember you told moses stop crying and speak bringing them back to genesis 1 26 he said moses stop being a prophet and you be god now the storm is ranting and raising they gonna wake jesus up and jesus rebukes him again you know give little faith while he rebukes him because he know what his seed is capable of let's believe god church [Music] he's expecting these things he's expecting us to be overcomers he's expecting us to have divine love perfect faith he's expecting us to have a peace of mind he's expecting us to be healed he's expecting these things because that's who he is but he's

what a message brother diggs such a confirmation i don't know if you caught it i did brother caleb preached last wednesday and just testified of that exact god doing something in his body to get him and surrendering to the ministry see brother caleb i just i thought what a synchronization of god's mind brother dick's testifying god has his god has a way to get our attention amen if he god has a way to get us to stop and sometimes we say oh that's just the devil sometimes it's the lord the lord is who blinded brother dick's eyes because god was trying to get his attention god was doing something in his body to get him to surrender to a call in his life are you glad you served that kind of a father amen who loves you too much to leave you like you are amen praise the lord appreciated that so much tonight amen brother diggs i was reading actually last night we just did a little devotion and i was reading in the compendium just a quote book if you'd have a compendium the red books that are bound and they have a quotes upon a section and it was about attitude and brother brandon was talking about that's that uh luke chapter seven about that noble man that centurion and i love this i just thought it was so amazing brother branham says i like the attitude of that centurion tonight that we've just read about he was a man that felt unworthy didn't feel worthy he said lord i'm not even worthy that you'd come into my house but if you just speak the word he said he said he was a man that felt unworthy as long as you're feeling unworthy of the blessing you're asking for you're pretty apt to get it as long as you're feeling unworthy to even ask the lord brother adam says you're pretty apt to get it he says but when you get to a place where you think that god just owes it to you that's when you're mistaken we're in debt to god not god in debt to us he's talking about attitude say lord that's my attitude i don't even feel worthy that you'd ask me but i want to be your expectation amen praise the lord we have some needs we want to look to amen and i just want to see what we've got here i know my wife is at home sick just battling something we're just praying for her

and father you're expecting her to believe you're expecting her to claim a healing love lord it's the reason why you could preach a word like this tonight father to anchor in on our faith nor did she climb up to that place where she belongs and bind up the enemy and stand on the truth of your word lord you're expecting us to believe in you lord as only a true believer can lord and the other young man is jump school lord you have not given us the spirit of fear with love power and a sound mind and lord we pray you would give him a certain soberness right now lord lord he'll be able to fulfill
