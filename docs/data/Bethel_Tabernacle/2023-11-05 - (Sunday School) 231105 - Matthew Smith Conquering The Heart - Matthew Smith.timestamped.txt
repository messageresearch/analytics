[0:01] um we'll start at at verse one
[0:04] Deuteronomy Deuteronomy
[0:06] 5 and verse
[0:10] one
[0:12] says um and Moses called all Israel and
[0:16] said unto them here o Israel the
[0:19] statutes and judgments which I speak in
[0:21] your ears this day that you may learn
[0:24] them keep and uh and keep and do them
[0:29] the Lord our God made a covenant with us
[0:31] in Horeb the Lord made not this Covenant
[0:35] with our fathers but with us even us who
[0:38] are all of us here alive this day the
[0:42] Lord talked with you face to face in the
[0:45] mount out of the midst of the
[0:47] fire lord add his Blessing to the word
[0:50] you may be
[0:51] seated um
[0:56] so the way I I kind of came about I I
[0:59] wanted to do a little bit of a a study
[1:01] of Deuteronomy it's it's kind of really
[1:04] kind of become a little bit of a new
[1:05] book to me um somewhat recently just
[1:07] because um I Heard a a Bible scholar um
[1:11] talking about um some of the ancient
[1:14] various ancient uh things in the
[1:16] scripture and he mentioned that one of
[1:18] the ways that they were able to as
[1:20] historians kind of
[1:23] place um the book of Deuteronomy in in
[1:27] the timeline historically
[1:30] is that the way it's written follows
[1:34] very similarly to a certain pattern that
[1:36] they find in other writings of the day
[1:39] amen specifically there's a um type of
[1:44] treaty they're known as Covenant
[1:46] treaties that are were primarily out of
[1:50] the um hittite Kingdom the hittite
[1:53] Empire and but they also were just
[1:55] around the whole sort of Middle Eastern
[1:57] Area even down into Egypt and things
[1:59] like that places like that and there's a
[2:02] certain structure to these to these
[2:05] treaties and the idea was that in those
[2:09] ancient times um that people had certain
[2:14] um obligations and duties and and moral
[2:17] obligations that you had to fulfill in
[2:19] order to be you know a good person right
[2:21] you know you have obligations to your
[2:23] family you take care of your family you
[2:25] you um you know you you're you're you
[2:28] have obligation and and the way you
[2:30] behave towards people is is you there's
[2:34] Bond a bond of kinship between you and
[2:37] your family that you kind of you have to
[2:39] uphold to that and so when your family's
[2:42] in need you help your family when when
[2:44] you know there's you know if they come
[2:46] under attack then you go to defend them
[2:48] things like this well if you're not part
[2:51] of the family well tough luck you're not
[2:54] part of the family get call your own
[2:56] family you
[2:58] know but
[3:00] when you have somebody that you need to
[3:01] build a bond with you need to build a
[3:03] covenant with that's not part of your
[3:05] family what they would do they would
[3:08] build these Covenant treaties and the
[3:10] and the idea within the Covenant was
[3:15] that by both parties coming together and
[3:18] and signing on to this Covenant you are
[3:20] becoming
[3:22] family right we actually understand this
[3:25] um and they would do this in those times
[3:27] as well but the way that it would do
[3:30] this we can see a a version of this in
[3:32] the modern time is through
[3:34] marriage um
[3:36] which might get into later but the idea
[3:39] is that you know here's somebody who is
[3:42] not your flesh and blood but you're
[3:44] going to build a bond in a covenant with
[3:46] that person who then becomes your
[3:48] ultimate kinship right even you know the
[3:52] Bible says that a man would leave his
[3:53] father and mother in Cleveland to his
[3:54] wife so here's you know even even your
[3:57] wife would even become more kin to you
[3:59] you who's ideally not
[4:04] related and yet and yet she's more akin
[4:07] to you than even your your own blood
[4:12] relations and so likewise you know with
[4:15] these when you would have two great
[4:16] kingdoms you know two kings would meet
[4:18] to build a covenant with each other um
[4:22] we can see in these ancient treaties
[4:24] that they they would refer to each other
[4:26] as brothers right that they that because
[4:28] they have now have this Covenant with
[4:30] each other they are now
[4:33] Brothers but that's if you have two
[4:35] equals right we we actually see this if
[4:37] when there's a a we have a copy one of
[4:39] these treaties in which the Egyptians
[4:42] met with the Hittites and it refers to
[4:43] the Pharaoh and the king of the Hittites
[4:45] as
[4:46] brothers but what we're a little bit
[4:48] more interested in is this other type of
[4:50] treaty in which one which which the
[4:53] parties are not
[4:54] equal this is what they called um a
[4:57] surain treat uh SU rain vassel treaty
[5:00] it's the it's the historical term that
[5:02] they use assus rain is a ancient term or
[5:06] a middle eastern term for in English
[5:08] what we would might refer to as like a
[5:10] lord um so we would in in a vassel it
[5:14] would be like a nation that is
[5:15] subservient to a much larger more
[5:17] powerful Nation so what would happen is
[5:19] you would have a great powerful King
[5:22] come in and he would make a covenant
[5:25] with some much smaller
[5:27] nation and
[5:30] the the the the purpose of the Covenant
[5:33] was that the smaller Nation now owes
[5:35] Allegiance and loyalty and taxes and
[5:38] tribute and all these things to the
[5:40] larger Nation but the larger Nation more
[5:43] powerful
[5:44] Nation owes them
[5:47] protection and and if they come under
[5:49] attack that his his armies are going to
[5:51] protect them that if there's famine in
[5:52] the land he he's going to muster his
[5:55] kingdom to provide food he's going to
[5:57] take care of them and the idea there was
[5:59] that it was a the Greater King was the
[6:02] father and the Lesser nation was their
[6:04] was his
[6:05] children and so when under that kind of
[6:09] treaty there's a certain framework that
[6:12] we see in all these different treaties
[6:13] that we found through various kingdoms
[6:15] and if you look at the book of
[6:16] Deuteronomy it hits every single one of
[6:20] the of the criteria that we would use
[6:22] for one of those treaties that it is
[6:24] literally God the father making a
[6:28] covenant to to his children and saying I
[6:31] am I have declared myself your
[6:34] king
[6:36] and here's and and so he he goes through
[6:39] a bunch of um and because it it follows
[6:42] that framework historians were able to
[6:45] place they were able to authenticate
[6:47] Deuteronomy as a as a as a historical
[6:50] document um that they were able to
[6:53] Modern um you know biblical historians
[6:56] use that as a major indicator because
[6:58] the idea here being being that the
[7:00] people of the time would have been very
[7:01] familiar with that type of of contract
[7:03] that type of treaty and so especially
[7:06] Moses having been educated in Egypt he
[7:09] would have been very well familiar with
[7:10] this framework so when the Lord is
[7:12] coming to him and that he's writing this
[7:13] out it's it's matching this contract
[7:17] framework and he's able to recognize and
[7:21] that it's it's it's the Lord trying to
[7:23] present this in a way that the people
[7:25] are going to understand that is his
[7:28] legally binding contract with his
[7:31] children that that binds them as his
[7:34] family
[7:36] right um and so there's a couple couple
[7:39] things that we can I I would like to um
[7:43] go through that at some
[7:44] point um but I want to lay a little B
[7:49] more framework first um the other thing
[7:51] that to bear in mind about the
[7:52] historical context of the book of
[7:55] Deuteronomy is that the the
[7:59] if you read through it and this is
[8:01] pretty evident from just reading the the
[8:03] book um it's the last thing Moses writes
[8:06] before the children of Israel enter the
[8:08] promised
[8:09] land and it's this it's Moses laying out
[8:13] you know discussing the Covenant
[8:15] discussing the history of where the
[8:17] children of Israel came from why they're
[8:19] there what they're doing and it's his
[8:22] instructions of you're going getting
[8:24] ready to enter the promised land and
[8:26] this is what you can expect when you get
[8:29] there this is what you need to do to
[8:31] enter the promised land this is how
[8:33] you're going to go about it this is the
[8:34] things that you need to bear in mind
[8:35] once you get into the promised land this
[8:37] is you know when you encounter troubles
[8:40] here's how you're going to uh approach
[8:42] them you know here's how you're going to
[8:44] overcome these
[8:45] things and here's how God expects you to
[8:48] behave once you get
[8:50] there
[8:52] and it's it's
[8:55] it's the reason why I I I really
[8:58] appreciate this
[8:59] is because and I'm I'm sure anybody
[9:01] who's um well familiar with with uh the
[9:06] message may have you might have heard of
[9:09] this before um I like this this
[9:12] particular quote in this isn't from
[9:14] questions and answers brother brandham
[9:16] says um Canaan right the promised land
[9:21] is a type of the Holy Ghost Egypt Egypt
[9:25] is a type or is the world that they came
[9:28] out of the Wilderness is where they were
[9:30] Sanctified called out Church Canaan is
[9:33] where they settled down with the holy
[9:35] spirit cuz they still had Wars and if
[9:37] you don't believe you have wars just get
[9:40] the Holy Spirit
[9:41] once right and so this once you kind of
[9:45] tie all these things together right that
[9:47] the that the you know that the the book
[9:51] of Deuteronomy is God's covenant with
[9:54] his people that that ties them together
[9:56] as father and children and and binds
[9:59] them all together and it's his promise
[10:02] that you know here's here is how you
[10:05] know who I am and and why I'm going to
[10:07] take care of you this is what I you are
[10:09] now obligated to do there's all kinds of
[10:11] blessings and curses associated with
[10:13] with obedience or Disobedience right
[10:17] it's also your instructions of how to
[10:20] enter into the promised land and for us
[10:22] the spiritual context of this is this is
[10:24] our instructions in a type of how God
[10:28] expects us to enter into the Holy Spirit
[10:31] and what we can
[10:32] expect you know as Christians as Born
[10:35] Again
[10:36] Christians and so it was such an
[10:39] edification to me
[10:41] because you know that statement where he
[10:43] says you know just get the Holy Spirit
[10:45] and you'll realize just how many
[10:47] warriors you actually have you know so
[10:50] often times we get this idea we get this
[10:52] mentality that oh you know especially if
[10:55] you're a new Christian or you know maybe
[10:57] maybe you're just an old Christian who's
[10:59] been at this for a while and you think
[11:03] oh I'm I'm going to become a Christian
[11:04] I'm going to get the you know the the be
[11:06] a born again Christian and then my
[11:08] troubles will all be over it's like
[11:11] you're going to you're going to break
[11:12] through and Conquer and then it's all
[11:13] going to be over but that's really not
[11:14] true at all that's I mean that's when
[11:16] your Wars actually start there's a
[11:20] a
[11:22] um you know we you
[11:24] know uh when the children of Israel did
[11:27] enter into Canaan you know they have
[11:28] this this first battle that they have is
[11:31] with Jericho right and it's a great it's
[11:34] a great you know great Victory
[11:36] everything you know the Lord just knocks
[11:38] the walls down and it's this great
[11:40] moment of Conquest this great moment of
[11:42] victory that they you know that they
[11:44] they Rejoice so much but what they you
[11:47] know what you know their next battle
[11:49] that they fought they got the stuffing
[11:51] beaten out of them yeah right and so
[11:55] many times you know Christians you
[11:56] especially like I said new Christians
[11:58] will come they'll come along and they'll
[12:00] get the Holy Spirit you know they become
[12:01] a Christian they become born again it's
[12:03] it's all great and it's all wonderful
[12:05] and they have a great victory in their
[12:06] life this big stronghold in their life
[12:08] that was you know they were facing that
[12:10] they couldn't overcome the Lord will
[12:11] just knock it down for them and then
[12:14] they'll the next thing that they come
[12:15] across will just run them right over
[12:18] they have and it just just Falls flat
[12:20] and the first thing they do is scratch
[12:22] their head go well I guess not I must
[12:23] not have been a Christian after all
[12:25] right well I guess you know well you
[12:27] know there went that you know might as
[12:29] well pack it up and go back to
[12:30] Egypt right like well no don't do that
[12:35] the problem is what happened was more
[12:37] like than not that first victory that
[12:39] you had there's still some little piece
[12:41] of it hanging out in your life somewhere
[12:44] right in in Deuteronomy chapter
[12:47] 7
[12:49] um pull this up here pull up the verse
[12:52] here it's verse
[12:54] 22
[12:56] um so this is this is God telling the
[12:58] children of Israel to not be afraid of
[13:00] these strongholds that they're going
[13:02] they going to
[13:04] face um well I'm going to go back to
[13:06] verse 19 it says the great Temptations
[13:07] which Thine Eyes saw and the signs and
[13:09] the Wonders and the mighty hand and the
[13:11] stretched out arm whereby the Lord thy
[13:14] God brought the out so shall the Lord
[13:16] thy God do unto all the people of whom
[13:18] Thou Art afraid moreover the Lord thy
[13:22] God will send the Hornet among them
[13:24] until they that are left and hide
[13:27] themselves
[13:29] um and hide themselves from thee be
[13:32] destroyed Thou shalt not be afed of them
[13:35] for the Lord thy God is among you a
[13:38] mighty God and
[13:39] terrible says and the Lord thy God will
[13:42] put out those Nations before thee little
[13:45] by
[13:46] little or by little and little um thou
[13:49] mayest not consume them at once lest the
[13:53] beasts of the field increase upon thee
[13:56] and so again reiterating that we have
[13:58] this idea a that you know you become a
[14:00] Christian and you you have this great
[14:02] victory in your life and suddenly well
[14:04] you're not going to encounter any more
[14:06] hardships right there's no there's no
[14:09] more uh struggles you're not going to
[14:11] have any problems within yourself that
[14:13] you're going to have to overcome well no
[14:15] that's not how that works the the lord
[14:18] gave a promise that it's going to be
[14:20] little by little right you're you know
[14:23] you're going to you're going to conquer
[14:24] one's stronghold and he's not going to
[14:27] let you move on until that thing is is
[14:29] annihilated right if there's any little
[14:31] piece of it left you'll try to go onto
[14:33] something else and you'll just fall flat
[14:35] on your face until you go back to the
[14:37] last place that you got Victory and
[14:38] really make sure you nailed that
[14:40] down right like you better not have any
[14:44] you know any little shred of it you know
[14:46] oh you know people so many times people
[14:48] want to get a victory in their life and
[14:49] like oh yes the Lord I gave me victory
[14:51] over this thing in my life but you know
[14:53] here's the little remnants of it that I
[14:55] don't want to stomp out you know I want
[14:57] to keep some little thing here or there
[14:59] that some little piece of this that I
[15:01] didn't want to totally destroy well
[15:03] don't do that you're going to you're
[15:05] going to end up not moving past that and
[15:07] you're never going to have victory in
[15:08] your life until you really burn it all
[15:10] down until you're really willing to give
[15:12] up every little piece of that you know I
[15:15] I found it so you know this morning I
[15:17] was thinking about this and the and it
[15:19] just so struck my heart you know the
[15:22] Lord has promised Israel a piece of land
[15:26] you know just a big patch of dirt
[15:30] and so many people that the there was
[15:33] this moment where people had the
[15:36] opportunity to enter into that and
[15:37] possess the land that he had he had
[15:39] promised them that was actually part of
[15:42] a covenant that he' given to Abraham
[15:45] right they had they had an obligation to
[15:47] take that land because they were the
[15:48] Seed of Abraham um I it strikes me um if
[15:53] we turn to Galatians chapter
[15:56] 4 the Lord put this on my heart this
[15:59] morning and I want to get to it
[16:02] um in Galatians chapter
[16:06] 4 and verse
[16:09] 21 it
[16:11] says um we're going to read all the way
[16:13] down to the end of the chapter it
[16:15] says uh tell me ye that desire to be
[16:20] under the law do you not hear the law
[16:23] for it is written that Abraham had two
[16:25] sons the one by a bond made and the
[16:28] other by a free woman but he who was of
[16:31] the Bond woman was born after the flesh
[16:34] but he of the free woman was by promise
[16:38] which things are an allegory for these
[16:41] are the two covenants the one from the
[16:43] Mount Si which uh guardeth or gendereth
[16:48] to bondage which is agar for this agar
[16:52] is Mount Si in
[16:54] Arabia andth to jerus um and answer to
[16:58] Jerusalem which now is and is the and is
[17:02] in bondage with her children but
[17:05] Jerusalem which is above is free which
[17:08] is the mother of us all for it is
[17:10] written Rejoice thou Barren that bearest
[17:12] not break forth and cry thou that
[17:14] travail us not for the desolate hath
[17:16] made more children than she which hath a
[17:19] husband now we Brethren as Isaac was are
[17:22] the children of promise but as then he
[17:26] that was born after the flesh persecuted
[17:29] him that was born after the spirit even
[17:31] so it is now nevertheless what saith the
[17:35] scripture cast out the Bond woman and
[17:38] her son for the son of the Bond woman
[17:40] shall not be Heir with the son of the
[17:41] free woman so then brethren we are not
[17:44] children of the Bond woman but of the
[17:46] free
[17:48] okay what struck me about this little
[17:50] passage of scripture is that here Paul
[17:53] is
[17:54] identifying that there is Mount Si in
[17:57] Arabia
[17:59] and another mountain of Jerusalem in
[18:02] Palestine okay and that you have the
[18:05] children of of Jerusalem and then you
[18:06] have the children of
[18:08] siai and that Sinai is of the Bond woman
[18:12] which is in Arabia and that Jerusalem is
[18:15] of the free woman right or the
[18:16] descendants of Sarah and therefore Isaac
[18:19] which is in
[18:20] Palestine which and the allegory that
[18:23] he's referring to is of course Hagar and
[18:25] Ishmael being the the son you know
[18:28] ishmail being the son of Abraham through
[18:31] Hagar and Isaac being the son of Abraham
[18:33] through Sarah
[18:35] okay today we can see this playing out
[18:38] right now right you have Sinai you have
[18:42] Arabia which is controlled by the
[18:43] children of is Ishmael to this day I
[18:45] just recently saw a video of an of an
[18:47] Arab man talking about the conflict in
[18:49] in um Gaza right now talking about how
[18:53] you know the Arabs don't really have a
[18:54] squabble with Israel so much because
[18:56] they understand that they're the
[18:57] children of Israel and they have their
[18:58] inheritance and the Israel has their
[19:00] inheritance in Israel and they don't
[19:02] really have a squabble with them because
[19:03] they're both under their inheritance as
[19:06] their as their you know father had you
[19:09] know this is and so if we look at this
[19:13] in in in the in Exodus and Deuteronomy
[19:16] here you have sin this place of the law
[19:19] where you have under sanctification you
[19:21] have people walking around under a law
[19:23] that they know they're supposed to do
[19:25] right but there's there's no real
[19:29] there's no Holy Spirit within them to
[19:32] change them to make them do right so
[19:34] they're constantly under judgment and
[19:36] bondage under a legalistic dry desert
[19:40] Wilderness
[19:41] system but then you have under the
[19:44] children of Jerusalem Israel they're of
[19:47] the free woman in the promised land and
[19:50] so you have the where you had the
[19:52] children of Israel are walking around in
[19:54] the desert around SI they go up to the
[19:57] promised land
[19:59] and they they were given the opportunity
[20:01] to enter into the promised land and then
[20:03] they got afraid of the battles that they
[20:06] were going to face once they did so and
[20:09] so they returned back and just walked
[20:12] around in varying degrees of
[20:13] sanctification for 40
[20:14] years right they just they just didn't
[20:17] go anywhere they never really entered
[20:19] into the baptism of the Holy Spirit and
[20:22] so what's this is this is an indication
[20:24] of an you this in the book of
[20:26] Deuteronomy where he's telling that
[20:28] history of as they traveled to the
[20:29] promised land they would come to various
[20:31] people they came up to Moab they came up
[20:34] to um Edom they came up to all these
[20:36] different places and every time the Lord
[20:37] would say you're not going to stay here
[20:39] this is their inheritance right we come
[20:43] to the land of Edom you're going to pass
[20:44] right through Edom this is the
[20:46] inheritance of the children of Esau this
[20:48] isn't your land you're going somewhere
[20:50] else okay you're just going to pass
[20:51] through you know they would come up to
[20:53] Moab well this is the inheritance of the
[20:55] you know of Lot's children we're not
[20:57] going to take that from them right we're
[20:58] going to go to our inheritance and
[21:01] so it what's an indication is when they
[21:04] got to the to the border and ready to
[21:07] enter into the promised land and then
[21:08] they chose not to do it what they're
[21:10] doing is implicitly saying we are not
[21:14] Seed of Abraham because if they were
[21:17] they would have gone to their
[21:19] inheritance you can't how are you going
[21:21] to say that you're a Seed of Abraham if
[21:22] you're not conquering and and dwelling
[21:25] in your
[21:26] inheritance right this is why brother
[21:29] Brandon would say that a that a Jew
[21:31] outside of the Holy Land is backslid
[21:33] right and so likewise as Christians so
[21:36] many times will encounter these
[21:38] situations you know people will be see
[21:40] these strongholds and they'll say well
[21:43] you know I can't do that right they'll
[21:46] they'll be they'll know that they should
[21:47] be living right they'll know that they
[21:49] should be you know because they have the
[21:51] law right they've been taught what's
[21:53] right and wrong they know what they
[21:55] ought to be doing but they'll say ah I I
[21:58] can't live a Christian life because
[22:01] these many Giants of you know bitterness
[22:05] or lust or or uh a you know grudges and
[22:09] anger and all these things that they
[22:12] they don't see away how in their own
[22:14] flesh that they can overcome right
[22:16] because as as
[22:19] Christians the Lord hasn't really given
[22:21] us a patch of dirt so to speak somewhere
[22:24] we don't have a a piece of real estate
[22:27] to go declare the holy land and declare
[22:30] our inheritance he's just given us this
[22:32] human flesh dirt that is our
[22:36] inheritance right and so many times
[22:38] we'll look at our own flesh that is
[22:40] completely corrupted with the seed of
[22:42] Cain right full of giants of of all
[22:46] these things within us that you know of
[22:48] desires and and and and and um and you
[22:53] know just things that we can't overcome
[22:55] that we can never overcome Within
[22:58] ourselves and say well these Giants are
[23:00] way too big for us so clearly this holy
[23:03] ghost thing isn't for
[23:05] me right clearly this and so and so
[23:09] people will just back away from it and
[23:10] say well I can never give up whatever it
[23:12] is right you have some you know
[23:14] addiction or whatever and and then
[23:16] they'll just back away from it and and
[23:18] then just go off into the Wilderness for
[23:19] 40
[23:20] years but the call is the call is to is
[23:24] to say but you can it it's the it's to
[23:28] have the faith to say yeah the Giants
[23:31] are going to remain there even once I
[23:33] possess it and I'm going to have to take
[23:35] years of growth to overthrow those
[23:38] strongholds but but little by little I'm
[23:41] going to possess everything that the
[23:44] Lord has promised
[23:46] me and uh that went by really quick and
[23:49] I had a lot more
[23:51] material um so we'll have to end it
[23:53] there um maybe I'll get an opportunity
[23:56] to kind of continue this thought I have
[23:58] a lot more material on it um but we'll
[24:01] stand and turn it over to the
[24:04] musicians and hope that was an
[24:06] encouragement to you and um have a word
[24:09] of prayer
[24:10] here oh Father Lord
[24:14] we we want to come before you this
[24:16] morning and and thank you for this
[24:18] opportunity to hear your word Lord that
[24:22] maybe something that would have been
[24:23] said or heard would would have touched
[24:26] the people's heart and that they would
[24:27] be able to hold on to it and they would
[24:30] go forward in faith and recognize that
[24:31] anything that the devil would come
[24:33] before them is is a is a lie father they
[24:36] have a right to possess their their
[24:38] promised land lord they have a right to
[24:40] their inheritance of peace and of joy
[24:43] and and and of Deliverance of anything
[24:45] that would hold them bound so
[24:49] father Lord just be with your people
[24:52] open our hearts Lord we we open our
[24:55] hearts to you Lord and ask that you
[24:56] would pour out your spirit upon on us
