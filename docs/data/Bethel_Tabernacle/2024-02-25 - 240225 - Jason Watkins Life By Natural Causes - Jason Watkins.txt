brother Tony crank up Bless That Wonderful Name oh my Hallelujah well we'll save that God bless you we greet you this morning we're going to invite you straight away into the book of Colossians the 3 chapter and we're just just going to read um a few I'm going to take one verse out of three different places uh two of them we'll go in Colossians 3 then Colossians 4 then 1 Peter 5 amen you love the Lord praise God Colossians 3:17 and whatsoever you do in word or deed do all in the name of the Lord Jesus giving thanks to God and the father by him on over into the fourth chapter Colossians 4 and two continue in prayer and watch in the same with Thanksgiving First Peter chapter 5 in 1 Peter 5 a single verse again verse 7even casting all your care upon him for he carth for you amen may the Lord bless the reading of his word as you have your seats I'm going to expand on those uh just in a few minutes as we get going here but I just wanted to uh amen greet yall in the name of the Lord T good to see you amen good to have sister Nicole here from Phoenix God bless you sis Jeff good to see you buddy amen where's Milo make him look at me Milo up here buddy God bless you amen happy to have him and other different visitors I see here God bless you today God bless you all we greet you in the name of the Lord and if I'm overlooking you that's normal so just trust me my church knows that amen uh but uh we love the Lord and um uh today I I thought to myself I was in the back room and I said you know I think I'm going to come out and start some new doctrines in the message and I'm GNA figure out how to line up some scriptures and line up some quotes and put them all together and I'm going to call the first do do uh the brother Steve and sister Emily can't go to Idaho for a month [Applause] Doctrine and the next one and this one's probably going to get me in more trouble The Bowman should live in buur [Applause] Doctrine amen well praise the Lord amen so we're we're happy in the Lord amen oh yeah that's right Ike and Daniel are here today where you at guys here's Isaac Daniel I'd have them stand up but they would make the lights go dim if they stood up so amen so we praise the Lord for that amen and um happy to have all of you here and visiting with us amen God bless you now I want to look back um in our verses that we were reading for our opening text and in just in a moment um sister Esther just in a moment we're going to catch Philippians 4 but just wait for my signal so I you know I I I I would I would say today that this sermon is a little bit different in that for a number of reasons I'm preaching on Life by natural causes now it's odd because I I gave up that title months and months ago even last year and said hey I'm working on a sermon I'm going to call it life by natural causes but I and I made some points out of that and I don't know if I'm going to repeat some of them today I didn't go back because I don't even know where I said that but I know I didn't preach what I'm going to be preaching today um and I and just the way it came so this has probably been one of the longest building sermons in a long time and I found it striking um and I can just only say Supernatural uh that brother Matt would preach the Sunday school class he preached today and I told him I said because I I walked in after he' read his text I said Matt did you read out of Romans s because if he had said yes I was going to accuse him of thievery I was going to I said well the only thing he didn't and I said what did you I said' what was your opening text and he was back in in the Old Testament I said 'w did you get to Romans 7 no I said ' good I said so I was either concluding after listening to his sermon this morning for the Sunday school class that either he is a hacker and he hacked my computer or the same being that has been dealing with me went to see him as well so I'm going to go with the ladder amen although it's flipped upside down he got to start so um we're we're going to just build off of that and so having taken this many months all the way from last year to develop this sermon you can imagine how ironic it feels to me that did I use the ironic correctly Uriah Uriah and I have been having this discussion over the use proper use of the word ironic but to me you know uh it just seems bizarre let me change it that way but I I just conclude that it's the Lord and I want you to notice in in Colossians 3 and you don't have to turn back there we're getting ready to go to Philippians 4 but the the point is and this is another reason why this sermon is a little bit different for me be and I it's the kind I enjoy it's a little more on the Practical side those are actually my favorite kind of preach and I don't often get to preach them and so uh but you know it starts out with you talking about something practical whatsoever you do or say everything that you say and do ought to be able to be uh approved by the Lord Jesus Christ and you ought to be able to put his name as a stamp of approval on your actions so that means and that that's you say oh goodness brother Jason you're going to get into our business today Paul already did I'm just stirring you up by way of remembrance Paul already told you this 20 centuries ago that however you live however you address how wherever you go whatever you do whatever you say ought to have the stamp of approval of the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen now remember that a manifestation of the name of God is the word interpreted so God interprets his word by bringing it to pass so by the way you claim to be Christian and the way you live and do and think and say uh that you're saying to the world I am the interpretation of the name of God and if that's not true brother brandom said then stop calling yourself a Christian see because you end up bringing a disgrace and so he but I but I I want to Leap Frog over that today I'm not going to cabbage down on that it Paul's words here need no addition they're pretty straightforward but what he ends with is do all in the name of the Lord Jesus and then he has this in them giving thanks to God and the father by him so and then when he goes into Colossians 4 continue in prayer and watch in the same with Thanksgiving all right so there there so now Paul is starting to tell us in my mind he's telling us not just how to act and how to speak but how to think that we ought to have grateful Hearts to the Lord and our lives ought to be an expression of our gratitude would you agree with me amen so then you know Peter gives us these very comforting words cast all your care upon him for he careth you now the reason I'm emphasizing that scripture is because you know if you heard brother Matt's uh Sunday school class and you're about to hear me going into this you know we you're going to find out and you have already found out you're going to find out more that even with a new birth the sin nature remains in your flesh amen and that's the problem as as as the old uh you know the old saying we have seen the enemy and it is us you know the the man in the mirror is brother brandom said that's my biggest enemy is that guy and he said if if I can just get him out of the way then the Lord can can direct things according to His glory so you know and that really is the rub that's what causes the believer so much anguish of soul is that you know we find ourselves falling short of the mark of the prize of the high calling and we find ourselves not really living to the standard of a high calling and that's Grievious to a born again child of God so you know that then it comes back around full circle what do I do about it casting all your care upon him for he carth for you as brother Matt was saying this morning he knows that's your condition you didn't even volunteer to come that way the Bible says you were subjected to it by him see so God in order to be a re brother Brandon would say it like this and it's a profound statement that God would predestinate a man to need salvation in order to give himself reason and purpose for being see so so th this is all you just remember this is all his plan it's all his message you're his people uh it the whole thing is about him and and I'll promise you that living for him Jesus never said it would be easy but he did say it would be worth it and I will promise you that it's worth it no matter what labors you have to endure here no matter what part of the Satan's Eden you have to write off and forget it and let the world call you crazy for doing it but you've already set your vision to things above you've your heart is already there and you're ready to work for the master and I can tell you as I've often said the retirement is out of this world Amen so all right sister Esther Philippians 4 verses 4-7 rejoice in the lord always again I will say rejoice now I I'm reading from the uh the uh New King James Version so if you have that sister Esther if you can flip that for me the N the nkjv the the nkjv I want to read that I meant to tell you that already I'm GNA start again rejoice in the lord always again I will say rejoice let your gentleness be known to all men the Lord is at hand amen all right so now I let me say it like this that that if this these passages that you're reading and we're going to find out that the Lord is at hand and he's going to emphasize that more on down in verses eight and what more but I want you to realize that these are instructions for when the Lord is at hand these are instructions for the end time now they've been instructions for the church don't get me wrong they've been instructions since since Paul pinned them to the Philippian church but everything we read you're you're living in the age of of a Zenith of everything everything comes to full maturity in this age the church the world Christ the word the Antichrist the antiw word the the the faith goes perfect the minds of men go insane you understand Satan takes over the world Christ takes over his bride the world has the mind of Satan the bride has the mind of Christ amen so it's a stark difference that's why that that's why it is uh it is it what word would I want to use and not sound harsh or insulting but let me just say that there's no way given what I just said the the the difference is so Stark they're reaching such a Zenith they have grown so far apart amen Christ and the Antichrist are so polarized at this stage now in the ages it was uh it was mongolz it was a hybrid it was an ad mixture to use brother brenham's word of Truth and error and Christ winked at that sitting in the eternity's interceding for his church but he cometh like Paul said to the Jews at the end of their age at there was a time when he winked at that that ignorance you kept bringing in bulls and goats and turtle doubs and lambs and all that kind of stuff and he sanctioned it but you were never supposed to stay there that was only speaking of the Lamb that would come and now that he's come you actually now need to come to the New Birth and 1,600 years of animal sacrifice is now going to be moved it's going to be done away with it's no longer going to count and I won't I won't acknowledge your observation under that old system you've got to come up to where the lamb is now and be born again you must repent see so well didn't they have to repent in the Old Testament it wouldn't have mattered because they they they brought their lamb and they got a a you know a substitution where God just covered over over their sin and and and his grace stayed on them but those animal sacrifices never converted them amen it never so repent means to turn and go the opposite direction if you don't have a new birth you can't sustain that very long see you've got to have a nature change on the inside you are a Triune being you've got a flesh that has your your your brother Bram called them inlets and outlets and you know you have the inlets of your of this you have your touch and your eyesight and your hearing your smell and your taste but then you also have outlets in your spirit which is memory affection conscience imagination I mean all of these things conscience memory affection imagination these things are are Outlets that that steer the body and you make those decisions in your heart where the spirit lives see and inside of that spirit is either a fallen nature that you were born with or it or it's that old Nature has been annihilated by the holy ghost in a new birth and now there's a new nature which is no longer the one you were born with that soul that new nature is now the life of God himself and now you're thinking is informed by your new nature and thus you act different live different go different speak different whatsoever you do in word or deed you do all in the name of the Lord Jesus isn't that easy that's not complicated so so we we we're going to get to Romans 7 here in a minute excuse me so so but here in Philippians 4 where we're at right now let your gentleness be known to all men the Lord is at hand so the point I wanted to make was that there's just no way given the Stark difference between being born again and what the world is there's really no grounds for living a half Christian Life you're just not born again see or if you've ever had a new birth experience you've let it get you've let that flame get so low and you've so cold because you've let you've let Satan entice that man in the mirror to fill up your life with carnality blocking out the sunlight of God's word and you've been excellent and doing it and now your life is filled with carnality see and so you know I I I I want to keep going I don't want to get ahead of myself so we're looking now at the end time the end time calls for you to be either hot or cold so he says in verse six be anxious for nothing but in everything by prayer now the King James says be careful but the new King James James if you look at the Greek the anxious is actually a better word be anxious for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God and the peace of God which surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts and Minds through Christ Jesus so that is a sure sign that the peace of God is working in your heart because it surpasses understanding you're situation that's causing you the anxiety may not have changed at all but somehow you have the peace of God in all of it your circumstance may may may not have abated in fact is you want to talk about something that's hard to explain and this is the uh this is what gives the devil a migraine is that the harder he makes it on you the more peaceful you become the more you trust God and that is so counterintuitive to him he cannot figure that out see and that's why brother Brenham said he cannot impersonate that life he can impersonate any of the gifts but he cannot impersonate the new the new birth and he he doesn't understand how that that life of God gets inside of you he reads the doctrine he knows how it happens doctrinally you understand how it happens doctrinally I understand how it happens doctrinally I had a gene of God and two omnipotence met and the life in the seed came to life annihilated the old nature I understand that doctrinally but it's a whole new world when it I experienced it I I I read books about having kids but when I had my own children it was a whole new world and every grandparent knows that opens a door you didn't even know was there and you thought there all the all your doors of Love were open and then grandkids come along and you wonder if you've ever loved anybody it's the truth my grandkids know it take advantage of it I'm definitely a a stap and I love it not planning to change verse 7 and the peace of God which surpasses all understanding will guard your heart and Minds through Christ Jesus now I want to look into Romans 7 uh 14 and we will go down through I'm not going to read it all let me just go down uh go 14 through uh maybe 24 25 somewhere down in there 14 for we know that the law is spiritual but I am carnal so under sin you get that Paul is just saying because Paul's born again here this isn't this is not prior to Paul's New Birth experience Paul is saying this to Believers he's he's acknowledging all he's he's not he's not saying I'm a secret sinner he's saying I still got sin in my flesh I still have the greatest battle ever fought to fight just because I got the Holy Ghost I can't just it's not a vacation from here as I've heard me say I'm not going down to the docks uh to wait on The Old Ship of Zion and set on my luggage I I've got to fight if I must win amen shall others as brother Bram talks about that great poem you know they sell the the bloody Seas you know shall I have a life of ease While others fought to win the prize and sail through bloody Seas would you even want that I don't want that I want to do my part I want to stand in that redeemed crowd on the other side and say I fought also Hallelujah I don't want to be wishy-washy I don't want a shortcut I don't want a treaty with the devil I don't want a truce or an arm assist or a ceasefire if he stops shooting I'll keep [Applause] shooting wow say why are you so mad at the Devil I want him dead he's tortured God 's family long enough so Paul is breaking into this fact that the sin nature even after the New Birth remains in your flesh and you have to keep your guard up over it you're born with different propensities to various weaknesses we're all like that and and and a lot of times they say well this certain thing the person was born with it you know it's in their genes sure in your Fallen nature of course you need reged amen see so we all have certain propensities to certain different things I've went through that before and explained it uh for we know that the law is spiritual but I'm carnal sold under sin so that's the rub that's the that's the grind the law is spiritual but man this carnal flesh for that which I do I allow not I in other words I do things I know better than for what I would that do I not the things I know I ought to do I find myself too lazy to do them see but but what I hate that do I I mean can you can you just you know I just know how when I read that and I just say yep I can just see Paul laying down his pen see so here's some logic if then I do that which I would not if I'm constantly doing what I know better I shouldn't do it then I consent to the law that it is good in other words I know there's a higher power and a higher life that I ought to live and it bothers me when I don't see I consent to the law that it is good now so so and the next point is that Paul is taking ownership and he's he's exonerating God because the fact that I know I shouldn't do it then I know God is Holy and I can't blame him see now then it is no more here's his relief this is his relief valve this is how he lets off the pressure if then I do that which I would not I consent to law this good verse 17 now then it is no more I that do it but sin that dwelleth in me that's good I can get some separation there see I can go to the Lord and in prayer and say Lord you know I didn't mean to do that I got trapped in into it I was weak a moment of weakness maybe I wasn't prayed up enough maybe whatever but I don't want to be like that forgive me and the Bible says if we ask for his forgiveness he is faithful and just to forgive am see for I know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing for to will is present with me but how to perform that which is good I find not for the good that I would I do not but the evil which I would not that I do now if I do that now if I do that I would not it is no more I that do it but sin that dwelleth in me take that Satan amen I'm a Believer I don't want a sinful life say you now now that you're a Christian can you do anything you want you better believe it I only do what I want and the only time I do what I don't want is when I Stumble and make a mistake living the life of a Christian is joy unspeakable and full of Glory so Paul says here's my conclusion I find in a law this is helping you ex this is going to help you understand you I find a law that when I would do good evil is still present with me see still right here for I Delight in the law of God after the inward man the inward man is a different man than the outward man see but I see another law in my members that he's already identified that's his flesh Waring against the law of my mind that that that converted nature and and that's why brother Brandon would say this this that or the other my Holy Ghost would keep me from that of course he will doesn't mean he's going to force you to not stumble but he's never going to go never going to go along with it right and he's going to convict you constantly not the Lord doesn't condemn his family he condemns sin you've already passed from Death to life you're no more can come to the Judgment sin is no longer he that's he that's born of God hath no more conscience of sin see his Nature's been changed he has no more desire of sin but but yet it still exists in the flesh but I I I don't take my delight in living carnally I take my delight in living spiritually but I do see another law in my members Waring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members now verse 24 excuse me that's a a call from several weeks ago I can't seem to get rid of it but the devil's a liar anyway so so now you know some people are are known to have quite a high estimate of themselves and for those this 24th verse will help you oh Wretched Man that I am who shall deliver me from this body of death when you're filling all self-righteous and everybody around you is a bunch of Sinners can you please go read this 24th verse so we don't have to suffer through your arrogant self-righteousness oh Wretched Man that I am who shall deliver me from the body of this death I thank God thank God there's an answer this he didn't leave us in a conundrum he gives an answer I hate it somebody gives me a problem don't give me the answer why'd you give me the problem now I'm gonna lose sleep give me the answer I thank God through Jesus Christ Our Lord so then with the mind I myself serve the law of God but with the flesh the law of sin amen now the the the the beauty let let's go on down into chapter8 um sister Esther let's let's go into chapter 8 I love this having said everything that he has said he's now about about to tell you this is why there's no condemnation now for you even if you have made a mistake because you can repent so he says there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus amen who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit Rejoice friends Rejoice just Rejoice let off the pressure I could dismiss right here with M with Matt Smith's Sunday School in this lesson to this point and and I and I've only been going 28 minutes uh you can just let off the pressure there is now therefore no condemnation to them which are in Christ you are quite unindictable that's right amen amen because you've already passed from Death to life and the only thing the Lord is convicting you for is to bring you back to fervency amen amen so for the law verse Two for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death for what the law could not do and that it was weak through the flesh God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemn sin in the flesh in other words he knew I couldn't keep the law and that's why God gave it to man to prove to him he couldn't keep it the the law was a a decision the people decided they wanted brother brandom said they left the Egypt under the pillar of fire that A Cloud by day a fire by night that's the angel of the Covenant that's the angel of the Lord in the camp God had God knew they were stiff necked he knew they weren't born again of the Holy Ghost he he tells Moses I can't you know I can't live among them or I'll I'll slay everybody but I'll send my angel and he'll come among you see so that that's the difference you get over the Book of Revelation after the Millennium and the new heavens and the new Earth the Bible finally says finally at the end of the Bible God himself shall dwell so he doesn't need an office to do that anymore and so the the whole earth is redeemed the people are redeemed the atmospheres are redeemed the heavens are redeemed Satan's dead his demons are dead sin is gone Sinners are gone Hallelujah so right now we need the Holy Ghost living inside of us see so he says so so now the the law couldn't the the Paul takes that up on into Romans how that Satan that crafty Slicker used the word of God that was meant for life he took the law something that was good it came from God for goodness sake and it's all good Thou shalt not kill Thou shalt not lie Thou shalt not bear false witness Thou shalt not adultery those steal all these different things and and honor your father and mother and all these things keep the Sabbath holy these are all good things they're meant for life but Satan knowing how the science worked he knew that you that God's people even God's people even Moses even Joshua were living in a sinful body that didn't have a new birth on the inside and therefore so so Paul says he he he took advantage AG there was nothing wrong with the law the problem was within the people God's family and so he says that thing which was meant for life became death unto me so that's why Jesus the beauty of the scripture is is that for what the law could not do and that it was weak through the flesh God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemn sin in the flesh he took all your bad that you've ever done will do in the future and nailed it to his cross and he took the law the book of ordinances that was against me and nailed it to his cross it's why brother Brandon would say the most astonishing statement a preacher of the Gospel could say and he said God will never condemn a man for being a sinner amen cuz he was born a sinner God's not evil he's not unjust he'll never condemn a man for being a sinner the man was born a sinner God knows that he said what will condemn the man is that he remained a sinner when he did not have to that Christ came and for sin condemns sin so that you could be free and he went to Calvary and and Prophet said God convicted him condemned him convicted him as a sinner and sit him to hell so I won't have to go so you won't have to go your family won't ever have to go the love of God shed abroad see verse four that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk here's the key who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit those who have been willing to be born again and then let the spirit of God lead their life for they that are after The Flesh do mind the things of the flesh that's pretty obvious to see that's pretty blatant that's the thing that keeps pastors up at night and keeps them on their knees is is God's family living after the Flesh and minding the things of the flesh when they ought not to but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit for to be carnally minded is death stay you know just don't come to the New Birth and that's death bhet said you're not even living until you are born again you're just dying say well I am I am not you are too you're dying physically you're dying you're perishing you don't have eternal life this body is going to lay down the only people that that won't ever lay down in death are those who are alive and remain at the coming of the Lord every man born has an appointment with death see and so if you never give your heart to the Lord and never let him convert that nature you're just going to go on to where you're already going but if you let the Lord but to be spiritually minded is life and peace amen that's life when you allow the Holy Spirit to re recreate you and make you a brand new unit not join a church that can almost make you worse because then you're just piling up stones of unconverted people and probably said you'd be better to leave them out there because then they know they're wrong and can deal with them you bring them in a church put their name on a book shake a preacher's hand put them in the choir they think they're saved when they're not and then God can't even help them and deal with them because they already think they have it they're blind see that she's she's she's blind and says I have need of nothing that's the spirit of the age Thou Art wretched and poor and miserable and blind and naked and you say I have need of nothing when actually you have nothing right because when you have eternal life you have everything even if in this fleshly life you have nothing you have everything so so he says here here it is verse seven because the carnal mind is enmity against God for it is not subject to the law of God neither indeed can be see so you you can't know God just by a mental experience amen you You' got to do more than just admire the fine qualities of Jesus and call yourself a Christian because the carnal mind is enmity against God so it for it is not subject to the law of God neither indeed can be it's enmity it's it'll never agree with God's word see verse eight so then they that are in the flesh cannot please God it wouldn't matter your Works wouldn't matter how many hospitals and orphanages you build it wouldn't matter how how honest you are on your taxes or you feed the neighbor's dog that's not going to help you with eternal life you're going to reap you'll you you sow you reap if you sow good you'll reap good you give God will command people to give to you but as far as Eternal value again you've got to be Jesus said you must be born again amen amen so then verse eight so then they that are in the flesh cannot please God verse n but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of God dwell in you now if any man have not the spirit of Christ he is none of his that's tough man that's tough that's just straight If any man have not the spirit of Christ he is none of his and if Christ be in you now he's going to flip it to the other side if Christ be in you the body is dead because of sin all your desires are now for Christ just like a the a lot of times marriages are end up on the Rocks because first on the man he he never actually leaves father and mother and Cleaves to his wife on Amen and he lets Mom and Dad run his marriage on the girl she never accepts God's word that her desires are to be to her husband and all of her dreams and all of her plans even her La even her name become now changed and subject to his leadership so you've got men falling on one side women falling on the other side that is a recipe for disaster amen so so so that that's a that's an important point for brothers and for sisters your identity is lost in the identity of a godly man if he's not a godly man don't marry him don't marry him that's a recipe for hell on Earth so so and and that's and that's and that's exactly why it is the I'm here to tell you something 75 this is statistic 75% of all divorces are initiated by the wife three out of every four see what does that say about the weakness of men that they're married to and and a woman is naturally wired to be led that way she might be a women's Li but the holy spirit will take that out of her and show her her real nature see wo got quiet let me move on Lord please that wasn't in my notes that's free thank you all right if Christ be in you the body is dead because of sin the spirit of life and but the spirit of life is is life because of righteousness but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you that's not just on Rapture Day that's not just changing your your body that's bringing your body now subject to the word of God willingly freely of your own new will right see not against your will so so it becomes pretty clear thank you sister Esther so it becomes pretty clear that if you're it's clear that you're going to need a new life inside of you if you plan to walk in and out of the city of God Amen I don't I didn't know how to put it pler so that's how I wrote it it's pretty clear that you're going to need a new life inside of you if you plan to walk into the city of God Walk in walk out walk back in that's what I want that's the life I'm looking for it's what I'm living for it's what Abraham was looking for a city whose Builder and maker was God see so Paul makes it clear that that the life from your natural birth is no good and since the and and not only that the life and catch how I say this not only is the is the the life of your natural birth no good it's going to require a super natural experience because the life of your natural birth is no good for getting into the city of God you're going to have to have a supernatural experience and of course the leading question of Believers gracious since the first make Believers showed up in the early Church in Jerusalem ananas and Safara uh the leading question of believers for 20 centuries has been what is the experience of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and and what am I looking for and how do I know when it happens young people have this question and this question is needlessly hard and difficult it's needlessly difficult because the promise is easy and God wants to give that to you more than you want to receive it all you have to do is repent and and that means make a complete willing to die out to everything of the world and say Lord I'm tired of being me I want to be you I don't want to be me anymore I want a completely new life I'm repenting I'm turning away from all my former life and then Peter said then the promise is to you and it'll work for your children it'll work for theirs and as many as the Lord Our God shall ever call for 2,000 years that'll always be the formula it's not hard to get it it's just been there's been so much uh confusion and I I'm not here to condemn you know uh I grew up through a lot of confusion and and and things and the reason I can see why it is because you have to understand that the early church started with the pure word we've had to be restored back peace meal through hundreds of years so we had to come through Luther's justification and Satan had a 100 years to cl to muddy the water then Wesley sanctification and Satan's had hundreds of years to muddy the water then the iso experience and Satan's had uh more than a 100 years to muddy the water and then the opening of the word and now Satan is still muddying the water amen see so so I get it but you know what am I looking for and how do I know when it happens can I can I make a statement to you I don't know if I would make this statement in in another man's pull pit unless I just knew him very well but I have a right to say it here seeking a preconceived experience is folly amen amen expecting to come up and I'm going to have this kind of a sensation or this kind of an emotion or if I have this experience if I shout brother brandham says will I shout he said you might do that and you might not will I speak in tongues you might do that and you might not will this happen you might that might and it might not he says but one thing for sure is you will come subject to the word of God so I would say to you today that seeking a preconceived experience is folly it's counterproductive it's distracting and ultimately self-defeating and I've seen young people defeated by it decade after decade after decade let me tell you I'm going to set the record straight what do I seek for brother Jason seek from the Lord an experience which will change your old nature and place the love of God in your heart and change your desires and your whole life am something that will put the love of God in your heart you might sit here today and say but I already love God listen to me you listening there is a lifechanging difference is that a big one would that be pretty big in your mind if it's lifechanging there's a life-changing difference between having a love for God and having the love of God hallelujah I'm I'm telling you get the love of God say I already have a love for God there's a big difference between having a love for God charismatics have a love for God Pentecostals have a love for God evangelicals have a love for God they're not faking that that's real they have a love for God but that's a big difference a lifechanging there's a lifechanging Grand Canyon between having a love for God and having the love of God only the love of God Bridges the chasm and puts you back on the other side in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus with the you know go go to God for that experience and I would say it is an experience and go to God for that experience don't go to God for some preconceived experience go to God with your mind made up that I want to be changed I want to be I want to be a brand new person and go to him for that EXP experience and don't stop till you get it and you might get it in 5 minutes or it might take you five hours or five days but don't stop until something has changed you from the inside out and then whatever manifestation that brings to God be the glory why is that so complicated I've never understood that why do we see such a Thrust on our young people to have some type of emotional experience I and and I'm not against praying to speak in tongues that's the Bible I'm not against seeking to know God in those kinds of ways I love them I get to experience it every time I preach I'm in another world even if I walk out here sick I suddenly feel like a million bucks it doesn't even matter and I'm here to tell you I know what it is to be in the presence of God but but that presence of God comes and goes you're going to want to live in his presence always yes you're going to want to have something down inside you that not only has a love for God but loves his word and loves to keep it and wants to keep it and are sad when you don't keep it see so go to God for that experience with the love of God living in Your Heart by a new birth you can serve the Lord with your whole soul and you can overcome the sinful world that's how you'll know you've been changed I'm preaching about life by natural causes and it caused me to to think of the term death by natural causes and I did a little bit of research not being a medical professional but there's plenty of good sources and I've used them before and uh there's mayo and there's John Hopkins and different things and and you can you can verify all this yourself but you know what is the meaning now cat it because I'm going to use a contrast okay I I'm using a contrast death by natural causes all right so what is the broad meaning of the term death by natural causes and that is a very broad much broader than I thought it was but when when death is attributed to natural causes It generally means that the person died from you know died from a a medical condition or even perhaps an illness rather than some external Factor like homicide or suicide or an accident you weren't killed see but actually it can include diseases see and organ failure and other internal conditions basically natural causes are medical conditions that arise naturally in the body and progress to the point of death as opposed to an external Force causing the death and as I said and and this is what I found that it's a it's a bit of a broad category but it basically rules out un unnatural causes like homicide suicide or accidents so so then we ask ourselves and I I thought about this you know I thought about brother brandham talks about brother Bosworth and he died healthy 88 years old John Wesley the same thing he didn't have anything no diseases nothing was wrong with him brother Bram heard he's dying he races and almost wears his tires out getting there and burst in brother Bosworth what's wrong nothing well they said you're dying well I can't die I died years ago he said Billy I'm just going home that's it I'm just going home see so so he just died of old age and what what would the medical community call that when someone dies and there are no medical problems and there are no external forces causing their death and so there really isn't uh a a specific term for dying of old age but doctors will sometimes use the phrase death by natural causes in cases where there's no specific medical condition to point to essentially they're saying that the person simply died because they were old and their body couldn't maintain itself anymore all right and they have a term for this sometimes it's called old age sence or I didn't know what that meant but it's old age Frailty and so it just means the person's body simply wore out and couldn't keep going uh it can be one source said it can be the result of gradual deterioration of body systems like the heart or lungs or it could be because the person was no longer able to fend off infections or maintain proper nutrition the person died as a result of the natural aging process it's actually quite common but not easily defined and is considered a natural part of the life cycle amen amen so I I thought to myself how remarkable it is that with all of our scientific knowledge and advancements that we have there's still this gray area this murkiness when it comes to explaining death in old age they don't understand you know and and and it's like our bodies have an expiration date that we can't quite pinpoint see but but but I thought to myself well then what would life be by natural causes brother Jason isn't that your title why are you it's getting morbid you're talking about death I thought your your title was Life by natural causes yes and and and that works great life works great up until you're about 25 remember brother brandham you know and he started he he asked Dr Sam adir who was a good friend of his and we uh we had dealings there when I was a boy growing up I think Sam was still alive how long did or I think sister Jean I don't know if she's here today but uh but but I we we knew uh Dr Sam so so he asked him he said you know you you he said Sam he said how is it that I I up until I was 25 I ate carrots and potatoes and beef and chicken and and I drank water and put all these nutrients and vegetables and he said and it kept building blood cells and I kept getting stronger and I kept getting stronger I kept growing kept growing he said and then I passed 20 and he said I'm still eating the same chicken and beef and corn and potatoes and carrots and I'm still doing the same thing but I'm dying now I'm putting it in it's like I'm pouring it in a glass and it's just running out faster than I can pour it in and and Dr Adair told him said well Billy if we could answer that we'd understand the medical secret of life itself see so so you find that that with a good diet and physical fitness you can slow its effect and improve your quality of life while you're aging but you're still moving on Amen it's hard for young people to get their mind around that but as you get older you start thinking about that and I I I know there will be a people who are will be alive and remain when Christ comes and they'll never see death in the body and and and I'm and I'm trying to get there myself and I hope to I'd love to be alive and remain at the coming of the Lord hallelujah see but but but you know I I I know that I'm I'm living my last promised 10 you're you know the promised 70 I'm in my last 10 if I live all the way out to the promise and I might exceed that my dad did my mom has my brother didn't see I know many a 16-year-old never made it to 17 many famous people they just had a famous one in the news recently dead at 50 another one another one another one this famous movie star this famous sports star this famous person this politician and they lived out their whole life and ran like crazy and then they died as Melia Jackson said what then what then what are you going to do then when the preacher when you've heard the preacher preach the last sermon you'll hear what then you know when when when everything is finished and it's all said and done what then see and so a lot of times they don't they don't think enough ahead you know I I was showing you here uh Serv service or so ago that I mean 70 years is only 3600 weeks a little over 3652 weeks I mean what's 3600 weeks it was just last week the other day and and weeks go by like that and you only get 3,600 of them what are you doing with your life see so you know what if you didn't need to worry about an expiration date oh some expiration date of my body I don't have to worry about it because I I'll I'll I'll try to stay fit I'll try to stay healthy that way I improve my quality of life but I'm not worried about it's going to finally go down to the ground because there's an inner life in me a different me uh that's far more real far more important and that and that me is is being purged of death and is being filled up with life Hallelujah I'm trying to fill this body with life but it's full of death but I got an inner man that I'm filling it up with life and it's pushing death aside Hallelujah even as your flesh is is aging out you've started moving forward to more life every dayl amen it's reversing course yes when I thought about it like that then I take the words of the Lord and the chapter of Matthew fear none of them which kill the body but are able to kill the soul uh but are not able I'm sorry let me read again and fear not them which kill the body but are not able to kill the soul you don't fear that but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and Body in hell I'm going to tell you something friends I decided to stop dying and start living that's why I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost and now I'm a human being and I might be dying of natural causes but I'm also living by a new natural cause I've had a nature change and no one forces me to live like a Christian should I'm living by natural causes when my mind was enmity against God if yours is still enmity against God you're not living by you're not living eternal life by natural causes you're forcing yourself to do it in legalism but when you're born again now although this flesh is still perishing I don't live after the life of the outer man I live after the life of the inward man see you you you I mean listen this is why we have the promises of God you can't effectively work uh effectively for the Lord if you're sick and so I am the god that Health all thy diseases if you're sick in your body if you're sick you can't effectively serice serve god with a nervous breakdown I I think of sister Brenda Lewis when she wrote we've got rights in the Holy Spirit you've been given full Authority in his name there's no time now left for there's no time left now for crying and it's a shame to complain kick the devil fall off of your Mountain you're predestined and ordained don't you know that you're a soldier in the army of the [Applause] king Hallelujah that's an end time word that sister Brenda gave the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ when we come to I want to turn the corner and race for home you still good you know when Paul comes to our text in in Philippians 4 where we were previously and I'm not going to reread it but where we were rejoice in the lord always remember I say rejoice let your gentleness and the Lord is at hand and all of that be anxious for nothing uh the peace of God which surpasses understanding will guard your hearts Minds you remember that remember us reading that so when when we're looking at it like this you know Paul PA literally gave the the church real ammunition you know real positive exhortations they they all result in the maintenance of Peace in the body so the so the Saints can work together effectively as partners in the gospel amen because that's what you're called to see and and that's what the new birth brings you into a partnership you were Heirs of God but now you're join AES with Christ you're a partaker see you're a partaker amen you get me so so we find then that that he gives these five positive exhortations in our reading and we're not going to go back and try to break it all down but but just I want to say this statement again they result in the maintaining of peace in your life if you're born again by the spirit of God there's a way to keep peace in your life am there's and I'm talking about in your body and healing in your body and healing in your mind and and that way you can work effectively as partners in the gospel even in even in the midst of unbelief even in the midst of Satan's Eden see God hasn't left us without a remedy so I mean you have goodness we have what they had we have the antagonism of unbelievers we have the woke Community against us us if if if if we went out here on the street trying to preach some of the things that I'm preaching in my Pulpit I got a little bit of protection here the law will allow us to preach it here and not allow them to come in here and try to disrupt us and if they do brother Luther and brother Tony will drag them out legally see but now if I go down on the public Street and start doing this then they've got a right to stand on the other corner and hold up their signs see and so so and I'm not saying we shouldn't do we've held outdoor meetings and might again but the point I'm making is that there's an antagonism of unbelievers in the world on the outside and we you can't escape that and it it's just here it's Satan's Eden but greater is he that's in me than he that's in the world see I mean it's it's bad enough let me say this now I'm probably going to quiet you down with this one but it it's bad enough that we have antagonism from without among unbelievers but then you know you have the attacks from legalist on the inside I mean right right in the ranks of God's family thankfully we've cut the head of that thing off at bethl Tabernacle years ago and then it took me many more years to get it purged out of the bloodstream that's why we have a church that just Schism can never get started say better be careful the devil hear that he already knows it he already knows we're lovers of the word that we're all together we're all in this together he already knows it's all for one and one for all that's how we roll that's my speech that everybody gets when they're going to think about moving here is you better be real cuz if you're not bethl will see right through it and you'll never fit in just let your hair down take your facade off and just be who you are we'll love you we'll respect you if you got problems we'll pray with you we got problems too pretense we hate that here see and so you've got antagonism from the beli the unbelieving world outside you get attacks from legalists on the inside we have the shame that we have to bear uh from irresponsible supposed to be fervent believers who live in open carnality told you you'd get quiet amen sure have the antagonism of Believers have the antagonism of unbelievers outside our ranks the attacks from legalists on the inside the shame that we have to bear from irresponsible supposed to be fervent believers who live in open carnality amen and as if stupidity hasn't reached its height posted online for the world to see I'm going to say like brother Donnie some people are too dumb to be on Facebook that's right that's amusing but it's the truth they bring shame on the gospel bring shame on Jesus personally who has done so much for them that's what that's how I get when I have brought shame on the Lord when I have lived carnally I say Lord how can you even still love me you've done so much for me do you ever feel like that for you to say Lord I'm so sorry for my carnality you've done so much for me so then of course you you get Satan always trying to stir up friction among members in a church you're always going to have that Paul said in 2 Corinthians 7:5 we were troubled on every side without were fightings within were fears so Paul's remedy was then as it is now rejoice in the Lord that's where we read in Philippians verse in fact is if you go home today and you read verse eight where we didn't read but it the opening word is finally so I realized that the context of vers of verses four five 6 7 and 8 are are are the Holy Spirit emphasizing this is what you're going to need to do especially when it's finally especially when you're at the end time you're going to need to rejoice in the lord always see so these are inred obedience for overcoming The Darkness at the end time rejoice in the lord always you can't listen you can't do that with the you you you you know you can't do that without the life sustaining presence of God in your heart it's impossible sister hope you all have a safe trip God bless you they're having to leave early Jeff good to have you buddy God bless you I've got to catch flight there's no way Rejoice always in the lord always there's no way to to to do that without the life sustaining presence of God in your heart it's impossible friends you can't hold up you you can't keep the you know you you you get you get like you see you see this happen to people where if you look in the Book of Revelation this is off off the beaten path today I was covering this on my recent Bible study online that when you look at the church ages you found that that that white horse riders showed up with deceit in that first age and they were aimed at but then they relaxed and they lost their first love so that was the first effect of the deception they lost their first love and then the next the next Church age which was Smyrna meant bitterness and then the Third Church age pergam meant married see and so it's just like in the Garden of Eden you have Eve and she's already got a husband but Satan deceives her into taking a different husband amen and sometimes and that's what happens in churches that that people they they come to Christ thinking that this is really him and then they find out that they've believed some denominational theory that doesn't add up and the Holy Ghost won't have nothing to do with it and then what happens they they they they realize they've never came to Christ in a new birth they they're married to some other guy they thought was Jesus you remember Paul said that was his fear that you would follow another Jesus whom I have not preached amen and they they end up with a false Jesus and then what happens they get bitter they get disillusioned they lose their first love they get angry they get resentful and the next thing you know they're off marrying somebody else in adultery there's no way to sustain it friends you've got to have the lifegiving stream of the Holy Ghost down in your heart you must be born again see and that that's exactly why you have the world uh you know the world's view when they would say re Rejoice always really you know what what an what an absurd notion you're going to Rejoice even in bad in bad times and to them it's almost Preposterous given the realities of what they see on the news Well I see what they see on the news but I still Rejoice always I know the world thinks I'm nuts and that's okay because the I've got the comfort of the Holy Spirit and that is a fuel to my faith we've got the shout of a king in the camp I know the world is falling apart but I've got a king in the camp I've got the love that passes all understanding I've got peace in my heart prophecy shows us that at this time Satan's Eden the mind that that that that as I said earlier you also have the mind of God the mind that was in Christ Jesus has given to his family to sustain them I hope I've made my case today I'm going to finish it with two Psalms sister Esther let's first start in Psalms 37 I'm going to finish today with with these two Psalms and then we've got a baptism today now watch let me show you the real strength of letting the mind which was in Christ be in you verse 4-1 Psalms 37 4-11 Delight thyself also in the Lord and He Shall give Thee the desires of thine heart commit thy ways unto the Lord trust also in him and he shall bring it to pass you're suffering from sickness suffering from anxiety suffering from nervousness just find rest right here amen he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light and thy judgment as the new day rest in the Lord and wait patiently for him fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way because of the man who bringeth Wicked devices to pass cease from anger forsake wrath fret not thyself in any wise to do evil for evildoers shall be cut off but those that wait upon the Lord shall inherit the earth for yet a little while and the wicked shall not be yay Thou shalt diligently consider his place and it shall not be but the meek shall inherit the earth and shall Delight themselves in the abundance of Peace Psalms 94 verse 16-19 I think we have Eugene Peterson's message translation I'm going to need that after we read the King James in in Psalms 94 first the King James 90 Psalms 94:16 to19 who will rise up for me against the evildoer ERS or who will stand up for me against the works of in workers of iniquity unless the Lord had been my help can you can you say Amen unless the Lord had been my help my soul had almost dwelt in silence when I said my foot slipe thy mercy oh Lord held me up in the multitude of my thoughts Within Me thy Comforts Delight my soul Eugene Peterson translation called the message reads it like this yeah um Psalms 9416 to 19 in the in the message translation wait for you to get it up so they can read it with me all right who stood up for me against the wicked who took my side against evil workers if God hadn't been there for me I never would have made it amen don't live apart from the Holy Ghost friends if God had not been there for me I never would have made it the minute I said I'm slipping I'm falling your love God took hold and held me fast when I was upset and beside myself you calmed me down and cheered me up Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord blessed be the name of the Lord that's what I desire friends stand to your feet that's what I desire Anthony bring your team and let me get uh some help up here uh with getting our baptism already amen oh if the Lord had not been my helper I wouldn't have made it how many times have you ever been one of those and you cried out to God I'm slipping I can't hold on and somehow a hand out of nowhere comes oh you'll be all right I got you child oh the love of God how rich and pure my goodness friend you love the Lord amen so you're you're you're so here here's where your options lie this morning you either have one that's inescapable uh and and one that's escapable too the inescapable one is that if you stay in the life you're born with you die and you're you're going to die of natural causes or you might get taken out by an accident or some something get you killed but you know something friends and I mean I mean listen I mean I might die tomorrow my body might lay down and stop functioning but I'll be alive when it happens amen I'll be alive when that happens it it when a Believer lays down and their body can no longer support their life for natural or unnatural reasons sickness or accidents oh my when that when this body sheds I'll still be alive amen so you can either you can either die by natural causes or you can live by natural causes but but to live by natural causes you got to have the life of God in your heart cuz the nature you're born with is no good you're dying let's bow our heads father I've so enjoyed bringing this thought today it's been a long time coming and I've been thinking about it for quite a while and I I really feel like that the Holy Spirit guided it along and I believe it was received father with Open Hearts and Minds now Lord maybe there's someone here who would just say brother Jason I uh I I do have a love for God but I'm not so sure that I have the love of God and I want you to pray that the Lord will move me in that direction you want to raise up your hand to the Lord right now say father move me in that direction where I don't just have a love for you but I have a I actually have your love I have your life the Bible says that the love of God is poured into us by the Holy Ghost that's the only way it comes friends young people heads bowed if you are wondering today do I have it how do I know I have it don't don't chase some precon conceived notion stop chasing that you need an experience but the experience that you need is to come to God that's part of your experience come to God and say Lord change my whole life change my whole heart make me a new creation in Christ Jesus I Repent of all my sins all my life I don't want to be me anymore I want to be you I want you to live inside my heart the Lord will do that young person you don't have to come and look for some preconceived whatever how however however God whatever happens to you at that initial moment and it might surprise you but somewhere down the road you might experience some of those things you were chasing at the initial moment but the Lord has a life-changing experience ready for you if you're ready to accept it you don't have to fret over it or struggle all you have to do is believe on the Lord Jesus Christ repent of all your sins take his name take his life let him be the Lord of all your life may allow him to completely change you totally From the Inside Out the Lord is faithful to do that oh my and then you talking about feelings and Sensations that can come on as you grow in as you grow in Christ as you learn to draw near and your prayer life increases and you just get lost in the Lord oh every day the sun is brighter every day the breezes are warmer every day you're closer to Zion than when you first begun the love you have for God down the road is almost incomparable L to to love that you had at that initial moment loving the Lord is the most beautiful thing having the love of God in your life and the beauty of Holiness having a Sanctified mind and a clean heart something yes you still have a weaknesses in your flesh but now you've got a strength that can overcome them all you got to do is grow it all you got to do is build it all you got to do is add to it strengthen it the Lord the Holy Ghost feeds on the word of God draw yourself into his presence daily love him with without reservation don't hold back if you hold back anything in your repentance he will not seal you but he absolutely will not you cannot you cannot come to him 99% you have to have 100% repentance or or all the devil will do is he'll just back into his castle roll up his draw Breck and wait you out and that one little percent that you left there unsurrendered to God when it's all said and done and the the music is ended and the hoopla is over and you're no longer excited he'll just lower his drawbridge Walk Right Back across and start on that one point you left uncommitted to God and he'll just build his whole Kingdom right back from that it's got to be repentance thorough complete repentance you've got to mean business with God God that you are no longer wanting to be of this world you want to be a Christian full of the faith and virtue of the Holy Ghost it's a definite experience and you can have it today Lord I pray having delivered this message I feel the Holy Spirit has delivered it clearly unambiguously and Lord I pray that you will now move on hearts and Minds if anyone who doesn't know you in the power of your Resurrection may they know you that way today not only in your power but your power and your Resurrection May they know you in that way today the fellowship of your sufferings being made conformable unto your death that way Lord they can die like you died and be resurrected like you were resurrected that's really the short and simple way to explain it that's why we baptize lord it's why we're baptizing a young man today Lord for that very reason to symbolize his com his complete death and burial and and raised up in resurrection power in the strength it's a testimony of of work that you have already done in his life this is a public testimony we commit it now to you in Jesus name amen amen let's sing brother Tony again

father we thank you for the love of God that has been shed abroad in this young man's heart we thank you Lord God that you've already begun that work in him that work of the Holy Spirit and it's already building and growing lord it's been it's been that way for the last while and he he felt on his heart this you having done that he wanted to come back again and be re-baptized h a a a new way a new testimony before the world to say that yes he's loved God and believed God for a long time but now he's a new creation in Christ Jesus growing in the stature of the fullness of God not a statue Lord we're not looking to build statues had enough of them we're looking to build the stature to be as the prophet said the living Tabernacle of the living God's presence huj I thank you for the Holy Ghost in his life I thank you for that day on Calvary I thank you Lord that he stopped running he he described it Lord to me like that he just felt like he was just running and you finally just chased him and chased him and he knew you were chasing him and he tried to run faster and you finally just conked him knocked him down and he said I just stuck out my hands like put the cuffs on I'm tired of running I thank you for that day Lord I pray now Lord that he will be a continue to be a light Lord to his peers and those around him you've made him Lord a a leader among his friends and I pray that
