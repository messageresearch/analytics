[0:07] gracious heavenly father we come before
[0:09] you lord and we ask that your presence
[0:11] would be with us lord that you'd
[0:13] come and speak to our hearts lord and
[0:15] deal with us on the basis of your word
[0:17] lord
[0:18] guide and direct our thoughts lord may
[0:20] your anointing be upon each one lord the
[0:23] speaker and the hearer lord may your
[0:25] name be lifted up and glorified in all
[0:27] things we ask these things in jesus
[0:29] christ's name
[0:30] amen
[0:32] so we're going to continue on part two
[0:34] from the fruit of the spirit in the last
[0:36] days
[0:37] and
[0:39] we're going to get this turned on
[0:42] and i think we're gonna go back to the
[0:45] beginning
[0:46] i uh
[0:48] i covered just a few screens last time
[0:51] and did it very slowly so i'm gonna
[0:53] speed up a little bit this time
[0:55] by god's grace so ephesians 4 13 till we
[1:00] all come in the unity of the faith
[1:02] and of the knowledge of the son of god
[1:04] unto a perfect man
[1:06] unto the measure of the stature of the
[1:09] fullness of christ
[1:11] amen may the lord have the blessing to
[1:12] the reading of his word he can be seated
[1:16] amen so we have a promise
[1:19] that the church is going to
[1:22] come to this place so there's a per
[1:23] there's there's a purpose for the church
[1:26] beyond
[1:28] um
[1:29] merely the great commission
[1:32] so though that's
[1:33] uh
[1:34] integral part of it
[1:36] but it's something that's even goes
[1:39] beyond that
[1:40] and that that's that god
[1:42] is
[1:43] redeeming
[1:45] right
[1:46] that's that's what he that's that's the
[1:48] whole purpose from the beginning
[1:50] soon from his plan from the beginning
[1:52] was to reveal himself as a redeemer
[1:54] a savior and a healer so adam fell
[1:58] so god is going to
[2:00] right this wrong he's going to he's
[2:02] going to solve
[2:03] this problem
[2:05] and he he does that
[2:07] by fixing
[2:09] what was broken right
[2:12] men and women made in the image and
[2:14] likeness of god is what's broken
[2:17] and so god is going to bring restoration
[2:18] to that ultimately we know
[2:20] that's our new body that's immortality
[2:24] but
[2:25] we also understand that there's a
[2:27] process that we have to go through now
[2:29] number one it's the new birth by the
[2:32] baptism of the holy spirit
[2:35] so new birth and the baptism holy spirit
[2:36] are the same one and the same
[2:39] when you're born again you're baptized
[2:41] with the spirit you're circumcised
[2:43] in your heart you're regenerated
[2:46] all these different terms that the
[2:47] apostles use
[2:49] to describe this event that you're
[2:51] becoming a new creation
[2:53] in christ
[2:55] but god's purpose isn't just to leave
[2:58] you there
[2:59] he doesn't say okay i've called you now
[3:01] just enjoy your life and do whatever you
[3:02] please no he says i've i've called you
[3:06] for a purpose there's something
[3:08] i want to do inside of you
[3:10] i want to bring you to the bible we'll
[3:12] call it perfection
[3:14] or if we look at the word more closely
[3:17] it's speaking of maturity
[3:19] it's speaking of completion
[3:21] so there's a there's a process that god
[3:24] is working within us to bring to
[3:26] completion
[3:27] but we understand looking at the
[3:30] the whole realm of the ages
[3:32] that completion can only come
[3:36] by the revealing of the word and it
[3:37] can't come by a partial word
[3:40] it can't come by a denominational
[3:43] word because why they limit god they
[3:45] limit god's capabilities they limit what
[3:48] god is doing they say this is it no
[3:51] further
[3:52] and so each time a denomination raises
[3:55] up that's what they do and then they
[3:56] organize
[3:57] and they make a battle
[3:59] actually against god
[4:01] saying sorry
[4:03] you're not welcome
[4:04] here you're not welcome
[4:06] to reveal yourself to us we have what we
[4:09] have and we want nothing else
[4:11] and so god says fine i'll keep keep
[4:14] moving on keep moving on and so he keeps
[4:16] moving on keeps raising up more but
[4:18] that's what the reformation came for
[4:21] that's what luther was sent for wesley
[4:23] calvin
[4:25] zwingli all the different reformers were
[4:27] sent for a purpose to restore part of
[4:30] the word
[4:31] but it has to come to a place where the
[4:33] full
[4:34] word is completely restored
[4:37] because there's a there's a maturity
[4:39] paul says to the hebrews you should be
[4:41] teachers by now i want to teach you
[4:44] about melchizedek
[4:45] but now you're dull of hearing and you
[4:47] need to have
[4:49] have milk and be reminded again
[4:52] of the first principles
[4:54] but
[4:55] we'll go on to perfection if god permit
[4:58] well god didn't do it in that age why
[5:00] because as soon as the apostles passed
[5:02] away
[5:03] then
[5:04] the church started on a decline
[5:06] started going against the word
[5:08] that's why the reformation came then
[5:10] it's going on an incline
[5:12] inclined to what back to the fully
[5:14] restored word everything that paul
[5:16] preached
[5:17] and so everything that paul preached
[5:19] there was a purpose in that and it was
[5:22] to bring a people to maturity
[5:26] it was to bring a people to the unity of
[5:28] the faith
[5:30] and of the knowledge of the son of god
[5:33] unto a perfect man unto a
[5:36] a complete or another way that you could
[5:40] bring that word perfect man is a mature
[5:42] manhood
[5:44] so that's god's purpose for the church
[5:46] is we're to come to a mature
[5:49] manhood
[5:50] that's why the word
[5:52] is restored to us
[5:54] is to prepare us for a rapture
[5:56] this preparation and growth into
[5:58] maturity
[6:00] is
[6:01] why we're here and that's why i say this
[6:03] fruit of the spirit in the last days
[6:05] there's fruit of the spirit in every age
[6:08] when the holy spirit comes within you it
[6:10] molds you and shapes you into
[6:12] christ
[6:13] but if it's only a part of the word
[6:15] what does it shape you into it can only
[6:18] shape you into a portion of the word
[6:21] in in today today's dna's days we have
[6:24] the perfect brother branham says we have
[6:27] the perfect interpretation of the word
[6:29] with divine vindication
[6:31] uh that when that which is perfect is
[6:33] come
[6:34] the bible speaks about
[6:36] then we then we see dimly
[6:39] but then then we'll know him face to
[6:41] face
[6:42] we'll see clearly and so that's the hour
[6:44] we're living in where he's revealed to
[6:46] us
[6:47] face to face
[6:48] the perfect is come
[6:51] that which is
[6:53] fully mature so it's a fully mature age
[6:57] a fully mature word
[6:59] produces a fully matured people
[7:02] and so that's we're to have a fully
[7:05] matured fruit of the spirit in this day
[7:08] not not a partial
[7:10] not just a portion
[7:12] but a full growth in the character and
[7:14] likeness of jesus christ amen
[7:18] all right
[7:20] anointed ones at the end times brother
[7:22] branham says to see the fruit of the
[7:23] spirit in the last days
[7:26] and the bride tree ripening in the top
[7:29] of the time
[7:30] amen are we ripening
[7:32] we're in the age of ripening that's what
[7:35] god is doing that fruit of the spirit in
[7:38] the last days again
[7:40] there's fruit of the spirit in every age
[7:42] but there's a ripening that's supposed
[7:43] to take place what is ripening it's a
[7:46] maturing
[7:47] really when you look at ripening what is
[7:49] it doing it's getting it ready to be
[7:51] eaten
[7:52] when it's not ripe it still has certain
[7:55] chemicals and different things in it
[7:57] that's trying to prevent you from eating
[7:59] it's still too green
[8:01] you can't you don't want to harvest it
[8:02] then now they do they harvest it and
[8:04] they put it in some building
[8:06] but we're going to do it we're going to
[8:07] see it god's way we're going to be on
[8:09] the vine ripening then he harvests us
[8:14] and so we're what is the prophet
[8:16] sweetening up in the spirit is one way
[8:18] he puts it that's exactly what happens
[8:20] when the when when the fruit
[8:22] ripens
[8:24] so we're supposed we're supposed to see
[8:27] all the things that paul wrote about
[8:29] we're supposed to see it
[8:30] in its mature form today
[8:33] in a body of people
[8:36] galatians 5 6
[8:39] screens and it was 10 minutes so i guess
[8:41] i'm not moving very fast
[8:47] we'll do our best
[8:49] but we'll let the holy spirit direct us
[8:51] amen
[8:52] galatians 5 6 this i say then
[8:55] walk in the spirit and you shall not
[8:57] fulfill the lust of the flesh so paul is
[9:00] trying to get the galatians away
[9:02] from looking at outward obedience
[9:05] for their leadership and salvation
[9:06] outward obedience
[9:08] is what what the galatians were being
[9:10] preached at they received the gospel
[9:12] they received the holy spirit
[9:15] and then
[9:16] false teachers came behind them and said
[9:17] you ha in order to in order to get what
[9:20] you already have
[9:21] you've got to come
[9:22] and be circumcised and follow the law
[9:25] you've got to come and be part of the
[9:27] mosaic covenant in order to get the new
[9:29] covenant
[9:30] and paul's saying wait a minute
[9:33] what's what's happening here you've
[9:35] already got it
[9:36] somebody's coming trying to put you in
[9:38] under a yoke of bondage
[9:40] and so he's trying to explain and
[9:42] rightly divide
[9:43] the law and grace if you walk in the
[9:45] spirit you will not fulfill the lust of
[9:48] the flesh
[9:49] so if you're walking
[9:51] after the nature of the spirit
[9:54] you'll not perform or execute the works
[9:57] of the flesh
[9:58] and is your life worthy of the gospel
[10:03] brother branham says when this takes
[10:05] place the thing you'll do then you'll
[10:06] find out that the spirit comes that
[10:08] comes in you from the new birth you will
[10:10] believe and do everything that god says
[10:12] in his word
[10:13] is for you to do
[10:15] notice notice again what he says when
[10:17] that spirit comes in you from the new
[10:19] birth
[10:21] then you will
[10:23] believe and do everything that god says
[10:25] in his word for you to do so it's that
[10:27] nature change
[10:28] it's that spiritual transformation that
[10:30] takes place on the inside of the inside
[10:33] then you do not the other way around not
[10:36] you do
[10:37] and and then
[10:39] and then you get the spirit no
[10:42] get the spirit and then god molds you
[10:44] into obedience to the word and
[10:46] everything that the bible quotes for you
[10:48] to do you'll punctuate it with an amen
[10:50] and you'll not stop day and night until
[10:52] you receive it that's right that's right
[10:54] and in all this time
[10:55] you'll certainly above everything bear
[10:58] the fruit of the spirit
[11:00] amen
[11:02] galatians 5 17 for the flesh lusts
[11:04] against the spirit and the spirit
[11:06] against the flesh and these are contrary
[11:08] the one to the other so that you cannot
[11:11] do the things you would
[11:13] so the word lusteth there
[11:17] that means to set the heart upon
[11:20] so the flesh sets the heart
[11:23] against the spirit in other words the
[11:25] flesh is trying to control the control
[11:27] tower
[11:28] right the out that's how satan works
[11:31] from the from the outside in
[11:33] so from the outside
[11:36] the flesh the devil is kind of trying to
[11:39] control the heart
[11:41] but the spirit
[11:42] also
[11:44] sets
[11:45] sets the heart
[11:47] against
[11:48] the flesh
[11:49] so in other words there's there's a
[11:51] battle for control
[11:53] that's taking place
[11:56] and it says these are contrary
[11:58] the one to the other
[12:01] so that you cannot do the things that
[12:03] you would
[12:04] so when you receive the holy ghost
[12:06] a battle takes place on the inside
[12:10] and there's and we we have to engage in
[12:12] this fight the sinful nature that we
[12:14] have in our flesh
[12:16] wants to
[12:18] take control
[12:20] it's it's going to push to take control
[12:24] okay but but the holy spirit inside is
[12:26] also
[12:27] pushing to take control and what it what
[12:29] is the difference
[12:30] it's a matter of what we surrender to
[12:33] or as brother branham says
[12:35] which dog you feed the most you know the
[12:37] story of the black dog and the white dog
[12:40] and so our war begins and as a result we
[12:44] we struggle
[12:45] and we battle
[12:46] to manifest the reality of the spirit of
[12:49] the living god inside of us that's our
[12:52] that's what our ultimate goal is
[12:54] remember the verse before us if you walk
[12:56] in the spirit you won't fulfill the
[12:58] lusts of the flesh
[13:01] and so what's the key what's the key in
[13:03] this battle walk in the spirit
[13:08] verse 18 but if you be led of the spirit
[13:11] you are not under the law
[13:15] so that that's the necessity that's what
[13:17] paul is trying to point these people to
[13:19] in galatia and point us to
[13:22] is that we need to be led by the spirit
[13:24] if we're led by the spirit then we're
[13:25] not subject the law and we're not under
[13:27] the law
[13:28] we don't need to we don't need to take
[13:31] the ten commandments
[13:32] and lay them out in front of us and make
[13:34] sure we're obeying them because the holy
[13:36] spirit inside of us
[13:38] is leading us to fulfill
[13:41] that law our flesh can't keep the ten
[13:43] commandments
[13:44] that's proven out genesis to revelation
[13:47] our flesh walks in disobedience we do
[13:50] good one day we do bad the next day we
[13:52] can never maintain by our flesh
[13:54] obedience to the word
[13:57] the law
[13:58] is a school master to lead us to christ
[14:01] in other words the law is teaching us
[14:04] you cannot save yourself
[14:06] you cannot
[14:08] overcome
[14:09] the sinful nature
[14:11] you need christ
[14:13] the law shows us that we're sinners
[14:16] and the law puts us in bondage
[14:19] it puts us in bondage to punishment
[14:22] john
[14:23] 16 13 says how be it when he the spirit
[14:25] of truth is come
[14:27] he will guide you into all truth for he
[14:29] shall not
[14:30] speak of himself but whatsoever he shall
[14:32] hear
[14:33] that shall he speak and he will show you
[14:36] things to come
[14:38] so the guide
[14:40] is the opposite side of the one being
[14:42] led so the holy spirit is the guide and
[14:44] we are the ones
[14:46] that need to be led by him
[14:48] in all things
[14:50] that's that's
[14:52] if you're not getting it yet that's the
[14:54] key
[14:55] that's the key is to being being led by
[14:59] and walking in the spirit
[15:03] how what does that mean what does that
[15:04] look like well paul speaks about that
[15:07] what it looks like
[15:09] but the reality is i think each one of
[15:11] us understands
[15:13] it's your it's your connection with him
[15:16] it's your relationship with him
[15:19] that's that's the purpose of the gospel
[15:21] is to bring a relationship between you
[15:24] and god he speaks to you
[15:26] he teaches you he convicts you
[15:29] and he guides you in all things
[15:33] galatians 5 19 now the works of the
[15:35] flesh are manifest which are these
[15:38] adultery fornication
[15:40] uncleanness
[15:41] lasciviousness
[15:43] idolatry witchcraft
[15:45] hatred variants emulations wrath
[15:49] strife seditions heresies
[15:52] envyings murders drunkenness revelings
[15:56] and such like of the which i tell you
[15:59] before
[16:00] as i have told you in time past
[16:02] that they which do such things shall not
[16:05] inherit
[16:06] the kingdom of god this is what the
[16:08] flesh does
[16:11] paul gives us a list
[16:13] this is what the flesh does this is what
[16:15] the flesh produces
[16:19] and he says
[16:20] it's the works of the flesh it's the
[16:22] works
[16:23] that the flesh performs flesh doesn't
[16:26] obey the it doesn't obey the law
[16:29] it doesn't obey the word it's completely
[16:31] sold out under sin
[16:33] the flesh is under bondage to sin and is
[16:36] totally
[16:37] incapable of obedience to god
[16:40] we have to get that part of out of our
[16:42] mind
[16:43] that somehow it's we're going to get our
[16:45] kids to be real good and they're going
[16:47] to be totally obedient to the word hey
[16:49] kids are messed up
[16:52] that's why that's why we have youth
[16:53] meetings
[16:55] that's that's why we're working with the
[16:57] youth constantly
[16:58] is because they're messed up why are
[17:00] they messed up they're born that way
[17:04] they're born with a sinful nature
[17:06] and they make mistakes and they do
[17:08] stupid stuff
[17:10] and it's our jobs as fathers and as
[17:12] mothers
[17:14] to teach them to guide them
[17:16] but the reality is
[17:18] kids make mistakes
[17:20] because they're because they're
[17:21] dominated by the flesh
[17:24] and so by the word we keep them under
[17:26] under the atmosphere that they need to
[17:28] be until they get born again
[17:30] but the fact is they make mistakes
[17:33] and that's okay we're trying to guide
[17:35] them we're trying to teach them
[17:37] we're trying to help them to grow but
[17:38] that flesh is under bondage
[17:42] and it's not capable of
[17:44] obedience verse 22 but the fruit of the
[17:48] spirit
[17:49] is love
[17:50] joy
[17:52] peace
[17:53] long suffering gentleness
[17:55] goodness faith meekness temperance
[17:58] against such there is no law so that's
[18:02] the ninefold
[18:04] fruit of the spirit
[18:07] the flesh produces the negative
[18:10] the holy spirit in us produces the
[18:12] positive life of god this is the life of
[18:16] god so if you're talking about the fruit
[18:17] of the spirit it's talking about
[18:20] what's being produced the end product
[18:23] so the spirit we have to receive the
[18:24] spirit to do it a person can mimic a
[18:28] person can be in the right atmosphere
[18:31] and
[18:32] sort of produce these things you see
[18:35] brother brother branham talks about this
[18:37] with the pharisees
[18:39] interaction with jesus and the pharisee
[18:41] but jesus is telling them calling them
[18:43] vipers and
[18:45] uh
[18:46] all kinds of
[18:47] names we would say
[18:50] calling them a devil and it's it's
[18:53] the priest saying who's the one that was
[18:55] there when you were sick who was the one
[18:57] that was there
[18:58] there and and lend you that money when
[19:00] you needed it who was the one that took
[19:02] care took care of you and brother
[19:04] branham says the fruit they could outdo
[19:05] jesus in the fruit of the spirit
[19:08] that's not that's not the fruit of the
[19:09] spirit it's receiving the word
[19:13] in other words in other words what what
[19:15] is what is that mean so jesus didn't
[19:17] have the fruit of the spirit is that
[19:18] what brother branham's saying
[19:21] obviously not
[19:22] what what is it is that the fruit of the
[19:25] spirit is is not what we see
[19:28] externally
[19:29] and figure out exactly what it is when
[19:31] jesus was braiding ropes
[19:34] and getting ready to whip the people
[19:36] he wasn't going contrary to the fruit of
[19:38] the spirit he was doing what the spirit
[19:40] of the lord was leading him to do was
[19:42] showing him to do
[19:47] these these things are important to
[19:48] understand in their balance
[19:50] but the holy spirit
[19:53] this is what it produces in our life
[19:55] love
[19:56] joy
[19:57] peace these are these are all
[20:00] some of them are emotions some of them
[20:02] are attributes of character
[20:05] but when you have these things
[20:07] manifested in your life life
[20:09] against such there is no law
[20:13] god has not
[20:14] merely called us to avoid the works of
[20:17] darkness or to speak against the works
[20:19] of works of darkness
[20:21] yes he's called us
[20:22] to avoid them and he's called us to
[20:24] speak against them but what he's really
[20:27] called us to is to manifest his nature
[20:30] that's first and foremost when we
[20:32] manifest his nature then the darkness
[20:34] has to flee it's the light that pushes
[20:37] back the darkness
[20:39] and so when when when you're manifesting
[20:42] this kind of life
[20:46] you you can't you can't hold on to
[20:47] darkness you you can't grip darkness you
[20:50] can't live in darkness
[20:52] you're you're actually destroying it
[20:56] by the life that you're living
[20:58] not necessarily by the words that you're
[20:59] speaking but the kind of atmosphere
[21:01] that's created
[21:03] around you i mean think about these
[21:06] nine-fold fruit of the spirit what an
[21:08] atmosphere
[21:09] is created when these things are
[21:11] manifested
[21:13] it's it's it's incredible what is it
[21:15] it's god
[21:16] it's the nature of god
[21:20] brother branham says this in the
[21:21] marriage of the lamb the holy ghost is
[21:23] meekness joy peace
[21:26] long suffering goodness gentleness
[21:28] patience faith
[21:29] the holy ghost that's the fruit of the
[21:31] spirit
[21:32] that the holy spirit bears in the church
[21:34] of the living god sweetness and
[21:35] humbleness humility
[21:37] love one another love for one love one
[21:39] for another long suffering
[21:42] if a brother has gone wrong don't just
[21:43] beat him
[21:44] or something another go after him and
[21:47] see if you can get him back
[21:49] don't wait for the preacher do it you do
[21:51] it somebody else preacher can't do it
[21:53] all neither can the deacons
[21:55] everybody is a member of this body of
[21:57] christ should go after one another
[22:00] and if we got the spirit of christ in us
[22:02] he taught the great parable they left
[22:03] the 90
[22:04] and 9 and went after that one
[22:07] that's what we're supposed to do but we
[22:09] say oh let them go we never should do
[22:11] that we should be gentle forgiving
[22:13] long-suffering that's the fruit of the
[22:16] spirit amen amen i love that brother
[22:18] branham doesn't put that off on merely
[22:20] your pastor
[22:23] he doesn't put that only on the preacher
[22:26] but he puts that if you have the nature
[22:28] of christ
[22:29] your heart is going to be going after
[22:32] the 90 and 9.
[22:35] amen this is not a compromising spirit
[22:38] it's it's it's a spirit in you that says
[22:41] that brother or sister has gone wrong
[22:44] they've gone the wrong direction they're
[22:46] doing wrong they're living wrong but my
[22:48] heart in love doesn't just say oh look
[22:51] at that terrible guy over
[22:52] there isn't he bad let's just avoid them
[22:56] no it says oh my
[22:58] what's happening how can we help
[23:01] how can how can we help restore them
[23:04] how can we be a blessing to them how can
[23:06] we build them up that's the spirit of
[23:08] christ
[23:12] galatians 5 24 and they that are
[23:14] christ's
[23:15] have crucified
[23:17] the flesh with the affections and lusts
[23:20] amen if we live in the spirit
[23:23] let us also
[23:25] walk in the spirit
[23:28] if we live in the spirit let us walk in
[23:30] the spirit it's not we're not under a
[23:32] yoke of bondage
[23:35] if the message is a yoke of bondage to
[23:37] you
[23:38] and it's a bunch of rule rules and do's
[23:40] and don'ts then you haven't got the
[23:43] spirit of christ
[23:44] you haven't been changed or you've been
[23:47] taught wrong
[23:49] you've been taught wrong you've been
[23:50] approached wrong this message is not a
[23:53] list of rules and do's and don'ts
[23:55] the message is a relationship with
[23:57] christ
[23:59] transforming power and yes there is a
[24:01] standard
[24:02] but the holy spirit is the one that's
[24:04] working in you
[24:06] to give you a delight
[24:08] to obey the word amen
[24:12] when i threw away my shorts
[24:15] after i got after i came to the message
[24:17] went through my shorts no one was
[24:18] forcing me to
[24:19] i wasn't unhappy about it i was happy
[24:22] i was thankful i was thankful for the
[24:24] correction why i wanted to go there i
[24:26] wanted a way to go the way the lord
[24:28] wanted me to go
[24:29] that's just a small
[24:30] thing that's me and that's me in christ
[24:34] and that's you in christ in your
[24:36] obedience
[24:37] you know we we
[24:39] we're living in an hour that's lukewarm
[24:43] and we're living in under a spirit of
[24:45] laodicea that pushes us towards
[24:49] lukewarmness
[24:51] and
[24:52] you know it's it's not that there's not
[24:54] warmth there
[24:56] lukewarm is lukewarm it's not it's not
[24:58] freezing cold it's not i hate god i want
[25:01] nothing to do with him
[25:03] it's like well i i love god and i love
[25:06] my other stuff too
[25:08] lord help us to be delivered from this
[25:12] spirit of of compromise
[25:16] and
[25:17] and lust that's on this world the lust
[25:19] for the things of the world
[25:22] in um
[25:24] got a lengthy quote from turn on the
[25:26] light
[25:28] brother branham says
[25:31] think the people can go right on
[25:32] preaching the ecumen ecumenical council
[25:35] can join up with the catholic church
[25:37] just as they promise to do all
[25:38] organizations
[25:40] can come on but the mark of the beast is
[25:43] already there they take it in that see
[25:44] and they say oh hallelujah bless god
[25:46] there was so many got saved last night
[25:49] they did
[25:50] they danced in the spirit they spoke in
[25:51] tugs that don't mean one thing see
[25:54] oh they're meek and gentle and humble
[25:56] yes sir they got the fruit of the spirit
[25:57] that's no sign
[25:59] not a bit let me give you the fruit of
[26:00] the spirit oh okay
[26:03] between jesus and the pharisees see
[26:04] which one had the fruit of the spirit
[26:06] what if i stood as i started to say a
[26:07] while ago against
[26:08] christ now for a minute god forgive me
[26:10] for even saying it see but just to show
[26:12] you something what if i come to you and
[26:14] say say your congregation who's your
[26:16] friend who shows you who shows the fruit
[26:17] of the spirit your kind old priest who
[26:19] comes to you in the hospital when you're
[26:21] sick your gentle old priest
[26:25] that's right who is it always loans you
[26:27] some money when you're up against it in
[26:28] a tight place you members of his
[26:30] congregation don't you go to your kind
[26:32] of priest and he loans you money see who
[26:34] is that that's always loving and kind
[26:36] and showing the fruit of the spirit your
[26:37] kind old priest who has that studied for
[26:39] years and years in the synagogues down
[26:41] there where his great great great great
[26:43] great great grandfather come from all
[26:44] the way down
[26:46] who is it that studied and got worked
[26:47] hard and got doctors degrees and phds
[26:50] and lld's to know his this word and
[26:52] stand here and deliver it to you every
[26:54] sunday morning in his congregation
[26:55] you're kind of priests who is this
[26:57] renegade called jesus what school did he
[26:59] come from what school is he out of where
[27:01] is his fellowship card
[27:02] what organization does he belong to what
[27:04] does he do when you all have a family
[27:06] argument who comes to you your kind old
[27:09] priest
[27:10] all you have
[27:11] and you have an argument against this
[27:12] neighbor over here and
[27:14] an argument against and and your kind
[27:16] old priest comes and makes makes you up
[27:18] said you all are children of god you
[27:20] shouldn't do that what's this jesus of
[27:22] nathan it does
[27:24] tear tears the thing up what does he do
[27:26] lambast your organization what does he
[27:28] do called your plot priest a blind
[27:30] leader of the blind he called him a
[27:31] snake in the grass he took the sacrifice
[27:33] that god ordained and cooked the tables
[27:35] over and throwed the money out and
[27:36] looked upon them with anger do you ever
[27:38] see your priest look like that now where
[27:40] is the fruit of the spirit not by
[27:42] speaking in tongues not by dancing in
[27:44] the spirit not by joining church not by
[27:46] fruit of the spirit christian science
[27:48] can outsmother any of you on that see
[27:49] and deny even jesus christ was divine
[27:52] not that but it's the word living
[27:55] there it is if they'd have
[27:57] only looked he was messiah he was the
[27:59] living word made manifest and a man
[28:01] that's got the spirit of god in him or a
[28:03] woman lives that word lives right out in
[28:05] them that's the heartbeat the
[28:07] predestinated for the word of the lord
[28:09] comes to them and they are the word of
[28:10] the lord word to the people written
[28:12] epistles
[28:13] read of all men is that right
[28:16] could the third pole
[28:18] be on
[28:22] you can't judge by speaking in tongues
[28:24] neither can you judge by the fruit of
[28:25] the spirit but it's a manifestation of
[28:27] the word of god brought to light it's
[28:29] the light that does it the man that
[28:31] walks in that light jesus christ was not
[28:33] founding upon speaking in tongues though
[28:35] he did it he was not the fruit of the
[28:37] spirit though he did it you couldn't
[28:39] judge it but he believed and punctuated
[28:40] it and god lived every word of the
[28:42] promise of that day through him
[28:44] that's the light of the hour that's the
[28:46] evidence when a man tells me that the
[28:48] holy ghost
[28:49] falling in them will deny the word of
[28:51] god being so there's something
[28:53] wrong with it
[28:55] amen
[28:56] there's many things that i could bring
[28:58] out of that and we're really out of time
[29:01] just take one moment
[29:03] in finishing it up is
[29:06] you you can't you can't take this
[29:08] statement where brother banham
[29:10] grabs this and shows it's not the fruit
[29:12] of the spirit because i've seen
[29:14] people in an out of balanced life they
[29:17] take that well it's not the fruit of the
[29:18] spirit see jesus lambasted them so they
[29:21] live a life
[29:22] of lambasting the people everybody that
[29:24] they see everybody that they're around
[29:27] that's not what's being said
[29:30] when when when we're confronted with a
[29:32] situation what is it saying when we're
[29:34] confronted with a situation that's
[29:36] against the word we take a stand
[29:39] it doesn't mean we have to be harsh or
[29:41] hard about it
[29:43] but we take our stand
[29:46] god called jesus to
[29:48] call them vipers and demons
[29:50] i'm not sure if he called you you and i
[29:52] to call everybody vipers and demons
[29:56] maybe a circumstance would arise but
[29:59] that shouldn't be our norm and default
[30:01] it becomes people's norm and default if
[30:03] somebody disagrees with me goes against
[30:05] my church that person is a demon and a
[30:07] viper
[30:10] i think it's a dangerous thing because
[30:12] you don't know that
[30:14] you don't know what's what's happening
[30:15] in the person's life you don't know what
[30:17] god could do down the road
[30:19] so the the purpose is if the lord
[30:21] reveals to you to say that then say it
[30:24] but if you're just saying it because of
[30:25] reasoning and logic
[30:28] leave your reasoning and logic aside
[30:30] love love them be kind to them but take
[30:32] your stand be firm
[30:34] it's scriptural to take your stand
[30:36] it's scriptural to have boundaries
[30:39] it's scriptural to say you can't you
[30:41] can't do that you can't speak that
[30:43] that's wrong that's not right
[30:46] that's loving that's a loving thing to
[30:48] do
[30:49] but
[30:50] in other words it's not what the world
[30:52] thinks the fruit of the spirit is it's
[30:54] not what the word world thinks
[30:56] living the word is
[30:58] it's what the word says
[31:00] and it's his leadership of the holy
[31:02] spirit so that's a terrible place to end
[31:05] i wish i had more time let's stand and
[31:07] and pray and
[31:08] next time i'm here we'll continue
[31:13] heavenly father we thank you so much for
[31:16] your
[31:16] light in this hour lord
[31:18] we know that it's as we
[31:22] see you as your revealed
[31:25] lord in this hour that we're
[31:27] changed and transformed into that same
[31:29] image lord
[31:30] and it's producing the very life of the
[31:33] word within us lord
[31:35] and that's the that's love that's the
[31:37] fruit that's the gifts
[31:39] that's all these things lord
[31:41] you're glorified
[31:43] in your people
[31:44] lord let us get ourselves and our flesh
[31:46] out of the way
[31:48] may we walk in the spirit and be led by
[31:51] the spirit
[31:52] so we wouldn't fulfill the lusts of the
[31:54] flesh
[31:56] and lord
[31:58] our
[31:59] is for more of you lord
[32:01] pour yourself out on us lord more and
[32:03] more
[32:04] may we be filled more and more with the
[32:05] spirit lord in every aspect of our life
[32:08] we ask these things in the name of jesus
[32:10] christ amen
[32:11] god bless you
[32:27] you
