========================================

[Music] [Music] so do do do do you will start with prayer father we just come to you now lord and we're so thankful for your grace we're so thankful that we know your name and we've been called by your name lord the whole family in heaven and earth are named after the name of the lord jesus christ what a privilege that is greatest privilege we have in our life to be identified with you to be loved by you lord to be known by you help us lord bring bring the anointing of your spirit upon speaker and hear that this would be sunday school would be delivered in in the right spirit the right from the right heart and that it would be received also in the right spirit in the right heart lord fill us with you may more of you be manifested in our lives we commit ourselves to you in jesus name amen all right we're going to continue on our topic of christian character this is part 5 and i'm going to probably spend the next few times we i i'm doing sunday school talking about love in the new testament there's four different kinds of love in the greek the first one is storge which speaks of family love then there's phileo which speaks of brotherly love or really friendship type of love then there's eros which is love between a couple and then there's agape which i would say is the love of god or unconditional love so uh in particular probably the next few times we'll be looking at love but also be looking at our love for one another as brothers and sisters in christ in the terms of friendship and studying friendship through the scripture but this time we'll be looking and focusing more on love just a comment before we go forward often we look at filio love and we describe it in regards to agape and we think of philia love as something um not necessarily negative but negative in regards to agape but it's not really a negative thing in the right context all of these loves are the kinds of loves that come that are blessings from god the song of solomon speaks about eros love the the bible is full of scriptures about the love of parents to children children to parents grandparents etc phileo brotherly love it's an important important kind of love but as christians agape love should be permeating everything that we do you know the world can love the way that they love but as christians our love our brotherly love our storge love our ear us love to our spouse should be infused with agape so with that said love is a word that is truly in the realm of being totally perverted in our day and age and especially english we so simplify the term love i love this steak i love my wife i love my friend i love my church i love this store i love these clothes and it's all the same word that we're using but the meaning is completely different and especially today um love is just a feeling you know the the you know in one time in in the history of the world when they talked about a marriage and they talked about love it wasn't in the realm of something you fall into i always get a kick out of you fall in love as though it's like it's a sickness that you catch and then well you can also get delivered of it you can fall out of love well that's not godly love that's what the world looks as love irreconcilable differences we couldn't just couldn't love each other anymore to a christian they don't know that doesn't even compute that kind of love the love that a christian has in his heart is as the scripture says shed abroad by the holy ghost it's romans 5 5 and hope maketh not ashamed because the love of god is shed abroad in our hearts by the holy ghost which is given unto us first of all god literally this means god is pouring out he's gushing another word another way it's translated is to run greedily it's like there's this great spilling out that is just covers us and is growing and growing and grow and it's still spilling out it's onward and and upward and growing in that sense to where it's in us and we experience god's love we feel god's love we feel transformed by that love and then because of that love goes out to others that's the source and basis of our love our love isn't based on well this person is nice i like i like this one but this one annoys me no the love that we have as christians is irregardless of any of those things we we know that we experience that we feel those things and yet we don't limit ourselves by those things we we say you know what god's love went deeper for me my love will go deeper for others first thessalonians 3 12 says in the lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another and toward all men even as we do toward you i love that verse it's it's so important to understand he's saying the lord make you abound and increase so in other words we have to grow as our christian faith matures so does our love for others mature or it's it's supposed to if you truly have the sanctifying work of the spirit of god living in your heart then that's what's going to happen you're going to increase and abound in love agape love towards one another um before i go on if you if you google love what definition do you find you find an intense feeling of deep affection so what is the source of love according to modern view the modern viewpoint it's a feeling and guess what everybody knows feelings change feelings are strong sometimes feelings are weak sometimes you get frustrated sometimes you get angry other times you feel romantic towards your wife sometimes you feel angry sometimes these are feelings they come and they go that's not what love is that is absolutely not what love is love is so much deeper love is so much stronger um you know you look at even even if you look at webster's dictionary the old old version that noah webster put together in the early eighteen hundreds and he talks about love in a different way he says love is an affection of the mind excited by beauty and worth of any kind or the by the qualities of an object which communicate pleasure sensual or intellectual it is opposed to hatred love between the sexes is a compound affection consisting of esteem benevolence and animal desire love is excited by pleasing qualities of any kindness by kindness benevolence charity and by qualities which render social intercourse agreeable in the latter case love is ardent friendship or a strong attachment springing from goodwill and esteem and the pleasure derived from the company civilities and kindness of others it's much deeper and much better definition and yet i don't believe it's fully in line with scripture scripture goes above and be way above and way beyond what even webster is talking about matthew 5 43 through 48 jesus speaking in the sermon on the mount you have heard that has been said you shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy but i say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you this is a love that goes far beyond emotion you don't love someone that hates you based on an emotion your emotions immediately when someone hates you are hurt pain and probably wanting to lash out wanting revenge that's human the fallen human nature but christ is saying that's not what the spirit of god does in you that's not the natural reaction of a spirit-filled new creation in jesus christ your reaction our reaction should not be hatred our reaction should be love bless that someone's literally cursing you blaspheming your name throwing you out mate pushing you away making fun of you the response should be love what is love again we hear through the modern 21st century idea we should love well i should have an intense emotion towards this person it's not what it's saying it's saying what does it say right do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you it's not saying you're going to have an intense feeling of some kind of strange love towards the person though that might follow you you might be angry you might be upset but you know as a believer with the spirit of god inside of you my responses should be i'm going to do good to them i'm going to bless them you know you you hear people coming against you coming against what you stand for the response is i want to defend what i'm doing jesus doesn't say to do that he says bless them pray for them yes you you know we defend by the word but i think it goes way beyond just winning an argument it goes into truly loving that person the way christ loved us how did christ love us while we were yet sinners while we were enemies with god christ died for us he did what was necessary it wasn't merely that he felt what was necessary that's not what this is talking about what he did what was god's will for him to do for us verse 45 that you may be so you want to be sons and daughters of god then if you want to be children of your father which is in heaven then you have to do good to them they hate you and pray for those that despitefully use you and persecute you in other words if the spirit of god is living inside of you it's going to create this response and convict you and bring you to that place that this is the kind of love that you have for people for he makes his son to rise on the evil and on the good and sends rain on the just and the unjust god is good to people that curse him every day that don't even believe that he exists and are actively spending their entire life fighting against him and god continues here's food here's food for you here's here's here's things to meet your needs here's blessings and all the while they're cursing him and he's that's okay my goodness is trying to lead you to repentance for if you love them verse 46 if you love them which love you what reward have you do not even the tax collectors the same love people who are unlovable love people that despise you what reward do you have if you just love the people that are nice to you it's really easy for me to love people that are nice to me it's easy for all of us but being a christian it has to i mean the words that jesus are saying here are basically saying come on come on everybody you're just living a natural life there's something i'm calling you some greater things higher things bigger things i want you to be like me and we just go on and say okay well so-and-so's nice i like being around them i'll bless them i'll take care of them i'll help them but so-and-so annoys me and frustrates me forget them well what thank have you you're doing the same thing that the whole world does 47 and if you salute the word salute there doesn't just merely speak of a of a greeting hi it's to welcome them is to say hi and come in that in that sense it's talking about like welcoming strangers saying i'm gonna i'm gonna help you i'm gonna take care of you i'm gonna do do to you what you have need of being done i'm gonna take care of you if you salute your brethren welcome your brethren only what do you more than others do not even the public and so be therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect my what a calling so love jesus is talking about love and he's describing and giving us clues what what this love is in these verses not an emotion look what love is love your enemies bless them that persecute you're you're praying for a blessing on the people that are coming against you do good to them that hate you provide for their needs if they have a need if they need help with something take care of them pray for them which despitefully use you make a portion of your time in prayer every day praying for people that are rude and mean and awful to you that you should dedicate yourself to that on a daily basis pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you then what does he go on if you love those who love you what thank so it's love it's loving people that don't like you it's welcoming more than just those who are friendly to you it's welcoming the people that dislike you that are rude that talk behind your back that do things that frustrate you that's love okay i'm going to read a quote from the sermon influence november 14th 1963. and brother branham says this and so we find the people doesn't realize the presence of god you know they ought to be like david the man was after god's own heart he said the lord is always before me wherever he goes he remembers god is always before him he's on my right hand and i'll not be moved because god is on his right on his right hand reverence we ought to honor one another respect one another as brother sister and love one another with undying love you say well i just can't well just stay here a little longer and then you will like people too you will like people too you'll love those who doesn't love you that's really a good sign of christianity oh my isn't that beautiful that's a sign of christianity in you don't think about other people this is about me and you that's a good sign of christianity i'm going to add to brother branham in me when you can i love from your heart that's important it's not fake it's not a put on it's genuine from your heart love those who does not love you love the unlovable jesus said if you just do favors for those who do favors for you well the publicans do the same thing but see you must be kind to those who are unkind to you do good for those who would do evil to you always remember that keep that before you that god is watching you remember god was good to you when you were evil to him while you were yet sinners christ died for you very beautiful and profound challenging words from the sermon living dying buried rising coming in 19 march 29 1959 brother branham says this he showed what he did to the whole human race the way god represented himself in jesus christ he has expressed he expressed his opinion to the human race to forgive and to love those that were unlovable and i wonder on this easter morning how short we fall of that we could love those who love us but he loved those who did not love him he was the greatest the first representation of love that ever hit the earth and was despised of those who lived on the earth to whom he loved no man could ever love like him and no man was ever hated like him they hated him and despised him and rejected him but it did not stop his love the last when he was hanging on the cross after that life that he had lived had been done nothing but good things forgiving the guilty healing the sick just things that were good when his last breath on the cross with the vulgar mocking spit of them who stood by hanging from his sacred face he cried with a heart full of love father forgive them for they do not know what they do he could understand being god he understands that's why he could love us when we're unlovable because he's god and he understands living he loved me never lived a like like it because it was wrapped in his love and he calls us to the same love the same heart of compassion true love welcomes those who are despised and rejected true love does good to people who speak evil you of you and try to ruin you you know love is not merely an emotion love is also not merely corrective you'll hear people say that and focus on that well love is corrective that's the end of the story it's not the end of the story love is many other things read first corinthians 13 again if you think love is only corrective go so far beyond that love is corrective love does bring emotions but that's not its basis love's basis is that he loved me he came to me he put that love in me by the holy ghost luke 6 35 but love your enemies and do good and lend hoping for nothing again again the attitude of the heart the approach to people the approach to situations give to other people don't expect anything in return that should be our attitude i'm giving of myself i'm giving of my time i'm giving of my friendship and my expectation i don't expect anything in return you say how can we do that we need friends that give back we do we do but the fact is as christians we shouldn't be watching and waiting for that to happen we should take the yoke upon ourselves and the responsibility on ourselves and say i'm going to do good regardless of what people do to me even if i'm rejected and despised a hoping for nothing again and your reward shall be great and you shall be children of the highest for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil john 30 john 13 verse 34 and 35 a new commandment i give unto you that you love one another as i have loved you that you love also one another that verse is so all-encompassing we read that about marriage husbands love your wives as christ loved the church but here christ is telling his disciples and that's all of us love one another as i have loved you how much did he love you you know greater love has no man than this that he would lay down his life for his friends how much did christ love you what did he expect in return he was mocked he was rejected he was willing to do that we need to be willing to do that for each other we need to love one another just the way he did to us verse 35 by this shall all men know that you are my disciples that you'll know all the doctrine no it doesn't say that not not saying that doctrine isn't important doctrine is important if you don't have the correct teaching of the bible you're not even really knowing who god is but that's not the point saying if you're my disciple there will be an outward manifestation that people could everyone can see and that is that you have love one to another you'll you'll be your life will be characterized by love for each other and love going out to those who hate you and despise you and people will say that's a christian those people are different in the token message brother branham says oh take take this solemnly we should love one another oh my we should be so in love don't never speak evil against one another if somebody makes a mistake pray for him right quick we're together in this with god we're brothers and sisters amen romans 12 9 and 10. i'm going to read it from the english standard version let love be genuine abhor what is evil hold fast to what is good love one another with brotherly affection that whole sentence is just one word love one another with brotherly affections it's fillo storgos is the word so it's filio and store ghost it's like it's saying there's a family and brotherly love that you should have for each other so it goes beyond merely uh what we love each other as friends it's like we're family like brother branham said we're together in this and we and we are we have to be so love one another with brotherly affection outdo one another in showing honor isn't that interesting it's almost like hey there's a competition going on here and the competition is this show honor uh honor each other win the competition and honor one another isn't that beautiful all right i'm going to read this quote from expectation it's february 7 1961 simeon this great old saint of god he was a man of great reputation oh today they happen to say but wait a minute sir i'm a businessman i'm a doctor i'm a professor you're no better than anybody else and whenever you think you're better than somebody else then you're you're nothing you ought to be scripture says when you get to a place you got how can you have faith when you're expecting honor one from another you see the difference there outdo one another another in giving honor but also don't expect honor from one another in other words you're not looking say well i'll honor them if they you know will come 50 50 in this deal no it's i'm going to completely give honor and respect regardless of how i'm treated that's christ you must see you must prefer one another always that's the life of christ to prefer your brother sister and if they're wrong that's all right you'll never make them any better by kicking them around put an arm around and pick him up i like this old time religion i'll tell you what i'll do it'll do it'll make a tuxedo suit set by a pair of overalls and put an arm around one another and call each other brother that's right i'll make a calico dress and a silk one call one another sister it sure will it's gun barrel straight and sky blue and we'll certainly do it i want to finish with a scripture um first thessalonians 4 9 and 10 i have more to cover here but we're running out of time and just want to finish with this scripture but as touching brotherly love you need not that i write unto you brotherly love is phileo you need not that i write unto you for ye yourselves are taught of god to love one another and indeed you do it toward all the brethren which are in all of macedonia but we beseech you brethren that you increase more and more he says you're loving you're loving the spirit of god is teaching you to love each other to take take a rejoice in each other and appreciate one another in friendship but increase more and more don't just leave it at well i'm loving i'm fine no we need to increase more and more that's the that's the life of christ within us that's the sanctifying work of the spirit of god is increasing us more and more in love let's pray heavenly father we're so thankful for your grace help us lord to increase more and more in your love lord may our hearts be filled with love and any any of those who may they've experienced hurts and and and things that have caused pain and and trials lord may there be healing and strength for them that they might rise up lord in the love of god and forgiveness and i know there's many more scriptures to review and and speak about in this lord but once again i just put my hope and trust in what the scripture says that you're teaching us to love and we thank you for that we ask these things in the name of jesus christ amen
