lord brother brad good to see you god bless you amen sarah sure enjoyed that singing so wonderful looking for brother burley this morning i don't see him he was going to be over in savannah on a um on an anniversary thing and so i told him he should stop in and if he did bring his preaching shoes but he ain't here so praise the lord i was going to make him sit anyway because i want to preach amen amen so i didn't have to be rude today amen god bless you we're happy to have you here in the house of god we want to turn right to the word of god this morning to uh we're going to go to matthew 24. sorry i didn't get that to you guys sorry to jump you up this morning but we're going to go to matthew 24. i don't have a powerpoint so you can relax amen debated whether or not to have one but there's always a question you know because it's gonna slow me down and i don't you know amen i just didn't want to do one today amen so i i gave it some thought but i decided against it amen all right matthew chapter 24 verse 15 and we'll go down through verse 28. when you therefore shall see the abomination of desolation spoken of by daniel the prophet stand in the holy place whoso readeth let him understand then let them which be in judea flee into the mountains let him which is on the housetop not come down to take anything out of his house neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes and woe unto them that are with child unto them that give suck in those days but pray ye that your flight be not in the winter neither on the sabbath day for then shall be great tribulation such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time no nor ever shall be and except those days should be shortened there should be no flesh there should no flesh be saved but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened aren't you glad for that then if any man shall say unto you lo here is christ or there believe it not for there shall arise false christ and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders insomuch that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect wherefore if they shall say unto you behold behold i have told you before i'm sorry verse 25 behold i have told you before verse 26 wherefore if they shall say unto you behold he is in the desert go not forth behold he is in the secret chambers believe it not for as the lightning cometh out of the east and shineth even unto the west so shall also the coming of the son of man be for wheresoever the carcass is there will the eagles be gathered together amen i want to speak to you today on the great gathering around the carcass the great gathering around the carcass let's pray father i stand before you in humility today lord well aware painfully aware of my inability lord to help anyone on an eternal level i can't reach that soul lord i can there's plenty to say lord that could that could entertain people that could be interesting that could be intriguing that would tickle their ears or engage their their spirit lord but father to reach that soul i'm helpless to do that it takes you you're the only one your word is the only thing that can divide us under soul and spirit and reach down to the very mire of the bone so lord we confess our dependency on you today may you come now as you always do come to your word lord grant your anointing both on the speaker and upon the hearer bless all of those here in attendance the visitors here with us today and those who are streaming lord and so i committed all to you now in jesus name amen god bless you friends you can be seated my in the breach brother branham begins to make several very important points that are for the church so that's us are you the church amen and there's there's two very important points that he's going to make just as he's getting started i'm going to rehearse those to you presently one we talked about a service or so ago and the other one i want to really emphasize today now brother branham one of the points that he makes that we've dealt with prior is that that you have to wait on god's timing of things you can't run ahead of him that that has caused more problems in fact is that was the uh part of the main problem that eve did she ran ahead of the plan of god he said you know the church pentecost has always done that that's been the mistake that they've made and you have to wait and it's not always easy to wait you know we're we have been here for more than half a century since the opening of the seals more than half a century since the departing of the prophet who operated under the ministry of elijah william branham and we we have seen the world falling apart we see it today we see it on an epic scale we see it on an unprecedented scale and we look back and you know i can remember you know coming up through the 70s and 80s we saw madness in the world chaos and craziness and we thought surely it's going to have to come soon and then the 80s rolled in and we thought okay well now absolutely it can't go any longer and everybody had their prediction you know and everybody put many put all their eggs in 77 which well you know which i'm not preaching on today but certainly hit right on the money just not like we thought it would and so um but it but it did hit exactly how brother branham said it would and i challenge anybody to prove that wrong you can't prove it wrong if you look at everything he said about it it hit on the money but not like we wanted to believe it would be and so we realized that that you know then you know the 90s and the year 2000 and there was no way it could go beyond that until it did amen you know it can't happen until it does and so but you know brother branham you know these were the times where we had to go back and look closely again at things that he said and when we did that you know we come across messages like you know brother branham taking and coming preaching a sermon not just one but you know by a particular title but but many times took this theme that he would talk about how that an unexpected god would come in an unexpected way or he would talk about an unexpected god coming in an unexplainable way and so we realize that god has everything in his sovereign control i'm so glad i'm so glad because one one of the things that we have learned is that we we had more to learn and the more we learn the more we realize we don't know and you know what people say you know what what's what are you doing i'm just i'm just i'm just going along amen i'm just letting god be in control how about we do that how about we just let the sovereign god i'm just happy to be part of the bride and you know my my dad who went on to his reward thought surely he would never raise children to see school days there was it was impossible for me to imagine that i ever would and now his children's children are raising children in school so you know you know i say you know okay tell us now do you when do you think it's going to come in the hour you think not [Laughter] that's for sure in the hour that you think not i remember years ago brother lee vale you know people's false teeth fell out he got up in front of an audience and he said i realize that brother branham talks about you know no man can know you know um you know we're we're talking about the year and people want to predict the year and he said i'm going to tell you you know brother branham said you know the day or the hour he said but i'm going to go beyond that today i'm going to tell you the very moment that he's going to come and everybody's like oh boy and he said he's going to come in the moment you think not in the hour you think not in the minute you think not and so you know i i'm just happy to be in i'm just happy to be in i'm glad i see it i'm glad i believe it because i can tell you as a human being you don't it's impossible to to to believe what anything about god except by god's grace and god's favor and god's election so you know i just realized this that i didn't put me in it i can't get me out he put me in and nobody can take me out but brother branham said you know you can never run ahead of him and you shouldn't try and that's that's a lot of times even the camps that we've had you know in the message of the hour and i you know i've i have lately began to reflect and it's astounding to me when i when i say to myself that i'm 50 am i 57 i think years old and uh you know i i don't i don't feel like that i used to ask my dad said wow dad how does it feel you know to be in your 70s and almost 80s he's when he when he was in his late 70s i'd say how does it feel to be in your 70s he'd say i don't know say why not he said i don't feel like i'm in my 70s i said really he said no he said i still feel like a young man he said now my body tells me otherwise but in my mind i still feel like i'm in my 20s and i think we can all relate to that some of us you young young people y'all don't know nothing about that but you ain't you ain't been through enough yet to know anything from anything but so so just just listen to your holy ghost-filled parents and obey them that have the rule over you as the bible says uh they're here to guide your soul and so make it easy on them will you amen make it easy on the ministry how about it make it easy on parents amen and so you know we're we're we we didn't volunteer for this position we were conscripted and drafted and you know can't get out of it and so um so if i got to do it well then i'm going to do it if i got to do it i'm going to put the pedal to the metal i ain't going to pull any punches because i didn't want to do it already so you know if i got to do it then you know if you've got to be a believer then be one be one be happy to be one be willing to be one see so so we realized that you know uh we're we i i realized that you know my life it's a privilege in one sense that you know i was born into this movement and as a minister today you know my parents were in the meetings and that's that's not that's not a wholesale thing that's kind of rare uh you know to have pastors who can say i was you know i didn't come into this in the 70s or when i was a teenager i was born and raised up in it my parents i sat as a baby in the prophet's meetings and so while i realized that that is a privilege i also am beginning to absorb the weight of responsibility because you know i can i'm like peter i'm sorry like like luke when luke writes he said luke felt a responsibility to say having had perfect understanding from the start you know so he said because of that i write unto the old theophilus so you know i realized today friends my obligation to you because i've i grew up in this thing i've seen it all i i was a young boy you know in the late 60s and coming up in the 70s i was a uh you know growing and becoming a teenager and attended the brandon tabernacle and and so i i i guess i'm i'm not bragging i'm just saying i've been around a while and i've seen the folly of running ahead i've seen men run ahead and i've seen the folly that causes and it's just often more often than not sadly it's pride and a sense of kingdom building and men trying to oh i've seen them come up i'm so glad for brother eddie wow you just don't know what a rock of gibraltar ed watkins was he didn't have that much time for men who tried to make themselves something more than the prophet was he didn't have time for anybody who didn't say what was on those tapes and i tell you what brother eddie kept us right right focused on the word of god and i was raised eating those tapes for a living and today i stand here and i feel the value of that in my life say did you have your times of course i had to be born again i had to come to a new birth as well just like you but but i have the benefit and i and i i just say to myself lord help me to take what i got and bring it to bear as a weapon upon the enemy help me to help your children help me so i can help them and so so when we when we when i you know when i when i bring a certain angle you have to understand this is going back decades of experience decades of watching of watching when i even even by the time i was in my 30s and began pastoring this church 25 years ago my goodness and you know i got i got seven grandkids that didn't even exist in the world they weren't anywhere they didn't exist see still in the loins of my sons and so but even at that time people say well did you know how to how to operate a church goodness no but i sure knew how i didn't want to do one i'd sure seen enough to know not how to do it i sure had seen enough errors and mistakes to and i'd seen enough balance and i'd seen the right way of doing it in the wrong way of doing it and i'm here to tell you something friends one of the we've said it before brother eugene taught it to us years ago one of the first signs of insanity is trying to go the same way and expect to arrive at a different place that's one of the first signs of insanity keep doing something the same way you've always done it and then expect it to come out different it won't when you sow to the wind you're always going to reap a whirlwind when you sow to the word you're always going to reap christ so let the word be your absolute have christ as the center of your life i could never preach a greater message than that and so you know the whole idea of of running ahead brother branham even said even in a vision that you can't he said i can see that the child is going to be healed but in the vision there's a hat laying there and he said i gotta wait for somebody because when she got healed the hat got moved and he said i didn't see who moved it i just saw that it was moved now i'm in the i'm in the room and there's the child hears everything but the hat's in the wrong place he says i gotta wait he said now a couple of things he said i can't move the hat myself neither can i tell somebody else to move it you understand friends that when god sent us this message he used a prophet and put him through the ringer him don't get in the way stay out of the way just be the vessel i can speak through and brother branham suffered a lot of hard crushing to get to that point because he in his early days he tried to run ahead of moving the hat and the child almost died but he had to wait on god's timing and you know if if 50 plus years since a profit has been gone i think if it's trained the bride in anything and all of the camps that have rose up and all the men who rose up kingdoms himself and all the crashing and burning that went on there and all the people's lives were blown up and young people blown up thank god in his mercy he gets all of his children back anyway so i'm glad the devil don't get any victory god just snatches it right out of his hands thank god friends you ought to thank god for that today it doesn't matter what the devil has put you through god won't lose you he finds a way to get you back even sometimes in spite of you he had to capture you handcuff you and drag you back but that's the love of god as brother brad was singing amen and so we find that we've had to learn to wait on god now the next thing that brother branham points out in the breach which is such a monumental sermon because if you he's going to go in and now he's going to bridge between the ages and the opening of the seals and there was a necessary bridge to explain because we're not going to go out of the church age because the bride leaves the seventh church age and goes into a rapture but there has to also be a spiritual understanding that the ages that that christ can't he's put out of the church ages and therefore that if the bride is going to uh continue on she's got to arise that's isaiah 60. arise shine and so we realized that that now there's a there's a there's a spiritual opening of the word of god and it's not mysteries explained in symbolism it's christ coming present among us and so we're we we've learned to think not differently as much as with greater precision and greater clarity all right so you you find that that brother branham you know he he he will go back and i'm going to read a few quotes here this this morning but so let me just lay some groundwork you're gonna if you go back and you look and i know there's this whole concept of you know the bright age and and is the bright age and then an eighth day and then all these kinds of different things and and that's just because you know a lot of time there's there are confusions about that because sometimes people look at them with a dishonest motive and i'm sorry to say that but it's it works to the advantage if a man wants to build a kingdom to himself it's an advantage to believe that the eighth day is a is a new day and therefore if it's a new day we gotta have a new messenger and well i'm just all too happy to jump in feel me you understand me so so so we find that the devil has used that and that and that when when we take and then then you know to take the message and well you know it's more than what paul understood and you know what that has done that's not true and that has that has been the very scaffold work that men have built the platform that's that's the very platform that they've used to step up on to say you know we've got to go beyond what paul because you know the next thing and it always happens well we've also got to go beyond brother branham and i've had the ministers look me in the eye and say that to me i'm not you know speaking of things i don't know what i'm talking about i've confronted them with their doctrines that a prophet never taught with their beliefs and ways of looking at the scripture and two lords and two souls and perusia and all these different things certainly there's an element of truth to all those things that's why it deceives because there's an element of truth to it but the but the but a lot of times the one promoting it there's a spirit behind it and sometimes it's innocent man i've known it to be innocent men who ended up later repenting and saying i came to my senses you know and and so so we're not talking about the man we're talking about the spirit that because the devil is so crafty he's been practicing on humans for 6 000 years he knows how you tick you understand he knows the levers and wires to pull he knows our characteristics and our makeup and our our you know uh what type of nature that we have and so we find that you know he and i'm just trying to go along by inspiration this morning is that okay i haven't gone off my first line of my notes so it's okay don't worry i'm not i'm not a marathon preacher don't don't worry you know know me by now because i don't want you to lose some of the very things i want you to keep and if i oversponge you i i'm always um you know thinking of that so so so now we find then that you know god is is going to have to have a balance and and think these things are are so often taken out of balance and and you know i've i've i've been watching these things my whole life growing up in churches becoming entering into the ministry traveling around the world preaching you know on on every continent except antarctica in this in this world and i've met a lot of people i've been in a lot of regions i'm so glad that i can report to you today that the holy ghost always builds the same kind of person take it from me i've been there i it doesn't matter what race what color what culture what nation what continent what region well the raising doesn't matter you know god always builds the same kind of believer and and that and i can go overseas and meet people who i've never met in my life and in five minutes i would be ready to entrust my life to their care you can't explain that that's god that's the holy ghost and so so we realized that that there had to be this breach preached to to get the bride introduced because i'm going to take some quotes here in a minute out of uh out of some messages all the way back from the 50s and i i started to lay them all out here all the way through 1965 there's no need to do it i can just refer you to them because i'm not really preaching on that today but you know the the when people there's a lot of confusion about a bright age to which i just say look and brother matt and i were talking about this the other day that the reason people get confused is because they don't take the quotes back to the scriptures they don't follow brother branham in the bible they they they're they're you know they've got it they've got a motive that they want to do something and be something and if the quotes get in their way and and they have and i've confronted these men with their with their weird teaching and say but a prophet said well but brother you know sometimes if we're not careful we make the prophet say things he didn't even mean i'm like okay i don't think anybody knows what that means what what do you mean that he didn't mean that you mean what do you mean and and then you keep pressing them until they finally admit and i've had them say it to my face we are beyond brother branham we're in the bride age the bride is the final voice to the final age but they leave off the fact that she's the final voice to the final age under her messenger under her messenger she's the final voice to the final age and then they don't even understand why they're the final voice to the final age that's one thing that makes cracks me up is you start talking to people about what is that you think that's a cliche you know why why do you think you're the final voice to the final age well because a prophet you know said we we would be okay well why did he say that he was a he was a bible prophet so he had to have that somewhere out of the bible that principles he can't invent that you know what do you think this message is the opinion of a man it's not the opinion of a man a prophet is like a microphone that's why god uses a prophet he's perfectly mute until god speaks through him and what when you hear you hear him preaching but when he's when he's when the spirit is on him and it's thus saith the lord and he's teaching the word of god and even if he makes a mistake the holy spirit comes back and stops him see i i understand that he that you know we're not we're not saying that you know when brother branham coughs that's thus saith the lord well that's stupid to say that brother branham says you know i i and that's attributable to verily verily verily that's silly brother branham would find that silly that anybody would believe that he was never intending for people to believe that you know but but but at the same time he would turn around and say i am god's voice to you see this is why the message can't just be doctrine you've got to have a relationship with the author of the message of the hour and we're not afraid of this friends you're well taught we have mature ministry here i'm not afraid to talk about these things and so so you've been well taught in the bible for years and so we we see our position and so when you when you come to these kinds of things and we realize that that he's the we're the final voice to the final age because the alpha message under paul has been restored and paul was the final voice to all the ages you understand paul the bible teaches you that that that paul said if even if an angel come and teach any other thing even if i come back and try to change it you understand then let him be a curse paul said in the day when god will judge the world by jesus christ he will judge them according to my gospel my interpretation of who he is paul was the final voice to all the ages his teaching could not be countermanded even by god because god gave him the message and god is the same yesterday today and forever and he cannot change his own word or have a new idea so when the omega comes and we get a restored message quite naturally we're back to the original and we're now the final voice to the final age amen these things aren't hard to figure out if you just connect brother branham's teaching back to the scripture next time you open a message book or turn on a tape get your bible because brother branham will take you on a journey he'll take you on a journey through the scriptures he was a master at it and so we find then that that brother brown talks about it this this breach and so when he comes to the breach i mean the beauty the beauty of the mind of the holy ghost and the breach between the ages and the seals you know what he's gonna do he's gonna go all the way back to the old testament and he's gonna pick up the story of ruth and boaz and naomi do you realize that nobody in the bible not jesus not the apostles not even saint paul ever taught on ruth do you know the name ruth only it only appears in the genealogies you can read and the name boaz you only get it if you go into matthew and luke and he's talking about the genealogies of christ you'll find it there you'll find one reference back in the old testament where when solomon erected a a a a brass i think it was brass um pillar like 24 feet high 13 feet in diameter and he called one of them i think one name and called the other one boaz other than that there's no reference to it you understand jesus doesn't go back and use it as an analogy paul doesn't use it as an analogy the apostles don't use it as an analogy that story's never told anywhere in the new testament or the gospels do you know why because it was a harvest time message brother branham teaches that in 1954 it's a harvest time ruth came at harvest time hallelujah naomi's not not mentioned you don't even hear naomi talked about anymore why because it would only become relevant at harvest time and so a prophet has got to make a junction between the ages and the seals and he goes back to get naomi because that's who he's going for into moses elijah and he she brings ruth along who marries boaz because there would be a bride at the last day hallelujah who would be unique as that sermon was unique that's the mind of christ and so we find that the next point that brother branham makes i got to get off my first line the next point brother branham would make in the breach after he really drills it down that you can't run ahead of god's program because we have to wait he talked about world events he said but you got to wait don't run ahead and god will get everything in his time don't try to put him in a box and force him he says the next thing now is he tells of a vision when he's in the west and he has his hands up praying that did we ever get that sock for this i can hear my breath hitting that so if you think about that brother kev so so we find that he's praying and he's kneeling down and he has his hand in the air and he says something struck my hand and he says i looked and he said and it was a sword sword he said beautiful pearl handle over the guard he said and he said it was made of silver double-edged razor sharp because and he said my he said isn't that beautiful wow it just fits my hand so perfectly and he said a voice he said i you know i i i said a voice said that's the king's sword and he said i thought well if it had a said a king's sword but it didn't say a king's sword it said the king's sword he said the only the king's sword is the word and and and that's exactly because and and even even that the blade was made of silver because silver represents redemption in the old testament oh friends do you understand that this word that came in this hour was sent to redeem a bride out of the ages to bring it right here in a breach going into the opening of the seals to call a bride out of the church the only thing that could divide the bride from the church is the word and when it divides it it's redemption and if you come with it you're redeemed and if you don't you're not period it's the only way to get redemption and so we find here that he talks about the handle and he says now the handle he says it's to protect your hand and he said now when you're dueling and he said you lock swords and both swords are locked at the handles and he said then your sword is pushing right toward your enemy's heart and his sword is pushing right toward your heart and he says he says it takes even though the sword be the word it takes the hand of strong faith to hold it there to bring it to the heart of the enemy and so therefore we you know everything brother branham went through on a personal level every all the crushing it was all so that he could have a stronger hand than lucifer oh friends i'm here to tell you i don't i'm not glad that brother branham suffered so bad i hear life story i hear him break down to this day i guess i've heard that sermon 50 or 100 times over my lifetime i always am a blubbering mess at the end he's crying i'm crying i can play in the church and everybody be crying where none of us are happy for what a prophet had to endure but i'm glad it made his hand of faith strong to hold the word because he had to bring it to the heart of the enemy or the enemy would bring it to the heart of the prophet and that couldn't happen because he had to be the vassal on the earth to find a bride so you can rest assure that this message didn't come by accident it didn't fall out of a tree and hit somebody in the head it wasn't no he didn't have a he didn't have a bad dream like like like like uh his um dr um uh roy roy uh i forget the baptist preacher who ordained him um but he's but it wasn't about that he said billy you had a bad dream no he said i didn't he said i spoke he said i spoke to a being he talked to me he said billy you're crazy he said i'm not he said it wasn't a dream he talked to me i spoke to him he came and he came where i was praying and so so we find then that we have you know we have been placed on notice you know in the breach that something more is coming for the bride of jesus christ and you should be glad because you need it a place and an ability by the word that will manifest for you and i a season of perfect faith and we've looked for it a faith that will that will it'll culminate in the change of your mortal body it'll literally change you and the the thing that we have to realize is is that a prophet when he comes with this kind of an understanding he's he makes a statement to say i'm not coming i'm not here to tell you he's coming he said i'm here to tell you he's here this one i that i was speaking of in the breach is now among us it's the kingdom coming in and you're and he keeps going on he keeps preaching until he gets to a certain sermon and says i don't even call you church anymore i call you bride you understand so this is a a a a very clear line of demarcation this this is a moment where something transitions now we still believe as brother branham did to his dying day that that does not circumnavigate the corporal appearing of christ he said i believe in the physical return of the lord jesus all right so but but if you're going to see the physical return of the lord jesus you're going to have to have a body likened unto his glorified body and the only way you're going to get that is perfect faith and the only way you get that is i by a faith in the revealed word to give you that perfect faith so we find that we see that things are going on in the world and we wonder why it hasn't happened yet we wonder has it happened yet we wonder are we in it is there more yet to come all of these questions that we've asked ourselves for more than half a century and they've they've had every kind of thinking you know well when he stepped forward you know in in revelation 4 and revelation 5 and i don't i don't understand myself why why people have why they somehow disconnect chapter four from chapter five it's all one event only men only man hundreds of years later added chapters and verses if you look at the events beginning with chapter four verse one and a door is opened in heaven and of course that's christ and john is called up into a christ because he's not in the ages perfectly that's why he's alpha and omega you remember i taught you on that that brother branham makes the point about about teaching you that that that the he's alpha and omega he doesn't he said not everything in between see now you you say well christ is in the middle of the seven lampstand sure christ is in the in between but after the church falls and before she gets restored he is in the in between but not everything in the in between is him because men have started adding in their own thinking and their own ideas and and distorting it and messing it all up and you don't even you can't even go past irenaeus and have the correct interpretation brother brown said he was the last one to understand the godhead perfectly see and so as i was i was i i think i've taught on this i don't know i get sometimes it if i if you hear me repeating stuff it's because i preach every day uh on on a phone hookup and i'm teaching the book of revelation to brothers in california a whole group of us and different ones and so i know sometimes i don't remember did i say that on the broadcast or did i say that in church so just bear with me will you do it so so we find then that that he's he's that the omega is the restoration of the alpha and so the the ages can't receive them seals brother branham said they couldn't laodicea pentecost couldn't receive them they put christ out serve him with an brother prophet serves him with an indictment you're guilty of the second crucifixion of christ and therefore john is you know caught up into christ and and i i understand that when the bride goes out of chapter three she goes in the rapture of course she does physically but that doesn't stop the compound spiritual application because we certainly believe in the spiritual application of chapter five i sure hope so because there's there's a strong angel represented our prophet john who represented the bride and the strong angel is saying who's worthy to take the book that is paramount to us who's worthy let him come and a prophet says let him now come or forever hold his peace and so why why people don't want to take the spiritual side of chapter four when chapter four simply setting up chapter five it's just simply it's it's the whole thing is starting he's showing he's and that's why brother branham says in when he's teaching on revelation 5 he says here he begins to show he said chapter 3 ends the church and she goes in the rapture and she's not seen again until revelation 19 when she comes out of heaven with christ riding on white horses as the army that's true physically that's true naturally but then he comes back and he says now in chapter five he's going to start showing how he did it how he pulled it off how did he get a bride through all of that time of man's ideas and man's uh distortions of the word why because there was a lamb interceding for their ignorance see they were already buried uh by by the time of the second age they were already dead and finally they're crowned with a with a triple crown and then there it's the church has already went into the ground at that point and then she's going to come back out in a restoration under luther but luther didn't know that he was an unbeliever in sanctification luther didn't know that so god couldn't condemn him for that the blood is interceding on behalf of his ignorance because you can't disbelieve what you don't know and when when wesley comes on the scene he's got a further revelation than luther and everybody who stuck with luther now had to move into wesley but john wesley didn't know he was an unbeliever in the restoration of the gifts when they when their people would pass out in their meetings they'd throw water in their face thinking the devil was on them and they didn't know that that was the approaching of the restoration of the outpouring of the gifts the pentecostal the azusa fathers they they didn't realize that they were unbelievers in the perfect word they denominated around the gifts they didn't realize you know and but yet god still had people in there and still kept saving them that's why even brother willard collins even his dad under that old under that old movement couldn't see the message and brother of them said don't worry brother willard he's a lap over he's lived he's actually from another age he's he's graded on a curve oh hallelujah hallelujah but today friends we've been caught up we've been called out and called up hallelujah and it's time to come to the full understanding of the mind of christ we're going to need this perfect faith so has it happened yet are we in it is there more yet to come yes yes and yes see the enemy knowing this confusion would be here and he's always trying to run ahead and muddy the waters and he certainly i hate to say it but he certainly found plenty of willing vessels who think a little more highly of themself than they should i'm not here to question the motives i'm not here to judge them at all to their own master paul says in the 14th chapter of romans to their own master they rise or fall you know um and i can't think of myself also i can't follow the same folly of thinking of myself more highly than i ought i constantly have to come back and i you know your your your life as a believer is constantly repenting brother branham said that's the spirit on the bride of the last is to repent the spirit on the bride is to say i'm wrong in other words i can't get me there lord you're going to have to get me there you're going to be able to sing jesus led me all the way hallelujah we don't get cocky we don't we don't become prideful we walk in humility we're constantly owning our re our reliance upon the holy ghost hallelujah and so everything everything that we talk about including the third pull the the refilling of the holy ghost the fresh surge just coining phrases the prophet used the body change all of these things can only come and unfold in their order and you can't make them happen we're not even to try to make them happen we're supposed to walk humbly so that we allow them to happen you understand the revelation of this message is an event it's not gaining knowledge it's a happening something happened to them in the upper room see so we found out you know that um we've got a bride he starts to separate if you follow that and i was just going over this quickly just with brother matt the other day we were and i was saying look if people just go back and they they they cabbage down on the bright age the bright age of bright days and i certainly believe we're in a bright age in balance like a prophet taught it see uh but he also called it a bright time you find in the bright age isn't a term he even uses until 1965 and he uses it six times across five sermons in 1965 but if you but he also if you go back and include 64 and 65 he'll call it and he'll interchange it a bright time see in other words it's a time where the bride has been called out of the church she's she's under the restoration of the full word christ is among her she's she's receiving perfect faith she's walking by faith daily she's under full redemption she's not under the law anymore it's not about her works she's not under false teaching even even if she commits a transgression it don't even count against her because she's immune she has complete diplomatic immunity she can't even being prosecuted indicted or even charged you understand she's in christ hallelujah and so we find then that that that if you that if you keep going back you find brother branham just going backwards i said if you go backwards from bride time he calls it seed time and then he'll interchange it seed time pride time pride age because he's recognizing that it's come back to the full grain now he didn't recognize that at first and and and and the quotes i have i won't even bother trying to read them it's all in my mind and my heart anyway but but i have them maybe we'll get two of them when we can slow down next time we cover this because we're not going to finish today for sure but if you go all the way back to 1954 then you find brother branham you know what he calls it harvest time and he keeps using that all the way through 1965 and by the time you get into the late 60s after the seals he's saying bride time harvest time seed time bride age he's trying to identify you understand you've been called out of something hallelujah you've been caught up into an order of ascending you're already revelation 5 has already happened listen friends revelation 5 has already happened the book was taken who is worthy did someone show up yes did he take the book yes did he lose the seals yes when he does that mercy's over christ has left the throne but is mercy over no there it is is there is there still blood is there still an atonement is there still a mediator no of course yes no yes no there's not there is of course there is you know why because there's a separation in the ages is there any more atonement under that teaching no he's done he's not depositing mercy that blood doesn't count for that anymore why because that blood now has stepped forward and now it's a bleeding word and so you've got to take a hold of the bleeding word and there there is redemption no more man-made theory mercy's over for that he won't wink at their ignorance any longer hallelujah he requires all men to come and repent see so we don't get confused on these things so we realize that that that mercy is now in the ministry of the son of man aaron couldn't go into his presence without blood unless he was with moses he goes into the presence of god without the blood of the lamb he dies but then god tells moses go down and get aaron and bring him back up here he didn't bring an offering he didn't bring a lamb he didn't bring blood didn't have to he didn't have to adam didn't have to carry blood you understand adam didn't need blood before the fall the the first blood sacrifice came after the fall to to redeem his family through and you get me and so when moses brings aaron back up into the shekinah they walk in and out of the cloudy pillar aaron doesn't die you know why he's with moses and moses is a is a prophet and a prophet is a minister of the son of man it's an office of the son of man and the office and the ministry of the son of man is a ministry of atonement amen you understand so what have you what is it that you are feeding on when you're feeding on the body word of the son of man you're you're eating atonement you're eating mercy you're eating the sacrifice christ is the sacrifice she is him you are the blood of god by the spirit hallelujah now how much responsibility do you feel to tell everybody that you can don't keep this thing a secret they can't find redemption outside of this word and this word is now in the bride hallelujah oh my i hope i'm not blowing your fuses today so we find that you know he's he's we found out he's coming after the jews everything that we have is what israel rejected everything that we that we got the jubilee the the abstract title the the heart of flesh that was all to israel that's why it's going to return to israel under moses and elijah you understand but israel as a nation rejected it so it went to the gentiles that's why god knew that would happen that's why he gave joseph aznath joseph didn't go get her pharaoh gave her to him and because god knew that they would reject him and they did and the gospel went to the went to the went to the church went to the gentile church and we've operated for 2 000 years it's got to go back to israel and he's coming to destroy the earth that has rejected him that a prophet indicted but oh hallelujah you have to understand that that though he said i will destroy the earth with the curse he said but i'll send elijah i'll slip him in before that coming of that great and dreadful day of the lord what is that ministry of elijah going to do it's an injunction god is putting an injunction upon his own self he's the only one who can that he won't destroy it until elijah gets in grabs a bride a shout goes and we gather around the carcass of the word and that's our scripture today and the bride gathers around the carcass of the word what is it doing you're eating the body word of the son of man what is it doing you are the blood of god by the spirit it's bringing perfect faith that's how you're staying separated from the world that's how you're going in a rapture hallelujah that's why the devil can't touch you that's why you're predestinated not to fall you're the only church in all the ages that is predestinated by god not to fall he'll come and take you before that could ever happen even though the deception would be so close it would deceive the very elect if that was possible so every promise to israel i gotta i gotta find a stopping point was inherited by the gentile bride and so you know the the the alpha church there's so much that she failed to accomplish so when people say well we we're we're going to be more than that church okay in a sense in a sense i can go along with that but don't tell me that it's because some eighth messenger brought us a new revelation that's greater than william branham who are greater than paul oh we got to go beyond that brother jason not find me the scripture that tells me we'll do that every scripture i find tells me it's a restoration back to the original now if you want to talk about manifestation now we can talk about it because because the the abstract that the holy ghost was to give them uh uh new bodies which they never came to why because they fell away you understand so they got so far going toward a rapture uh and and and that's why and i don't even have time to really get down into the scriptures of that maybe next time but paul picks that very thought up and he's actually talking about about people who are already under the grace of god already baptized with the holy ghost until paul starts talking about about a grace that's going to come at the appearing of jesus christ well wait a minute we've already why do we need more grace because it wasn't talking about his days talking about our day so there's a grace that comes with the revelation of jesus christ that grace seals you in that grace makes up for all of your mistakes that grace covers you i'm here to tell you god's got your back it doesn't matter what the devil does his grace covers you he won't lose you that's what the bleeding word has accomplished in our lives because we believe it that gives me authority over the devil i don't don't lose that friends you don't have to be under the bondage of satan in this laodicean age and whether it's a physical bondage a mental bondage an emotional bondage it doesn't matter what kind of bondage the jubilee has sounded and you can be free you don't even have to wait for the service to be over you can reach out and take a hold of it right now why why would you sit in misery and not make a claim oh friends make a claim today wow i gotta skip so much so brother branham comes now with man you know here we are in this in this day we find the world it's in a catastrophe i mean it's it's what's happening now was unimaginable only a decade ago you know brother branham talks about how that uh let me let me i i know what i'm gonna do now let me let me just skip down uh i finally figured it out thank you lord all right i'm gonna skip a lot we'll come back and catch it so brother branham comes now in the church age book and make sure that's where i'm supposed to be correct correct correct okay you got 10 more minutes all right so we find that that let let me come to this so i was saying a while ago you know how you can track it back through his ministry and when you go back into the 50s you you get brother branham calling it a harvest time and he comes to the story of ruth and he says see ruth came at harvest time and and so we there's 1954 and then he he goes from harvest time and he through 55 through 56 because he knows america is coming to her her line in the sand that if she crosses this line she's going to join the rest of the world in judgment the rest of the world's already under judgment no way no way to get it back america is the furthest west once you go to the west coast of america you're going to start heading back toward east again and so we realized that hollywood sits right on the west coast and that's why brother said it's so evil because there's like a barrier and and sin is heaped up like if you saw if you're at a river and they had a great wall and the water washes all the trash right up to the wall so we find then that he he comes through 54 55 and he's talking about the general harvest time he says you know he says the the church that went down comes back up at the end and and he says we find that he said if you look at at the story of ruth and he said she came at harvest time and then he goes to the political side and he says did you notice the jews coming back to palestine and so he's looking at all these world events and he says for the first time the six point star of david and brother branham has got this global world view that we have arrived at harvest time he's speaking to the he's interdenominational himself and he they wanted him to take sides he wouldn't take sides people want to do that today all you got to choose you got to take a side i mean it even goes on in the message today and we've got we've got to say well you know they're doing this over here and you know in in in jeffersonville and they're doing this over here in south africa and they're doing this up here in this city in this state and and you know i'm going to tell you you got to you got to choose a side you gotta pick a side well i don't have to pick a side i pick jesus this isn't dante's inferno you're not virgil i don't have to choose a side i i can i can choose christ there's nothing wrong with choosing christ hallelujah and so we find that he comes now but then he goes to 1956 and then in 1957 and now america sealed away her doom 58 59 and then he starts he's still calling it a global harvest he's still calling it a global harvest time and then in 1961 suddenly you can tell he's it's not crystallized in his mind just yet he he starts using language like seed time it goes from harvest time to seed time and he's starting to realize wait a minute there's something that should be happening here at the end time that should be different than the rest of christianity he's not sure what it is he keeps studying it he keeps talking about it by the time 1962 rolls around he comes to the pulpit and he says now today he says i'm going to explain you're going to understand today why i've said the things i've said and why i've done the things i've done and he takes a six-hour series called the spoken word is the original seed and now he's starting to understand hold on this whole global harvest time we need to we need to focus focus get your focus start looking a little closer that we got it we got a there's a separating line in there that he's starting to see he said now let look he said you know they they've had their former rain they've had their teaching rain and he said what did they do they sowed the seeds he said billy graham sowed his seeds you know and then he said then oral roberts sowed his among the pentecostals and he said but now what else has happened he said there's also been a word seed sown to the people because now here he is with the with the with the revelation of jesus christ series he's already went back into the church jesus and took out all the errors and put back in everything they left out of the word of god and fixed it all up but the seals still aren't open but he's starting to realize hold on there has to be an event coming up here and he starts to say you know you you you've had your former rain and there'll have to come a lot of rain he said we've had the former rain of the word the planting the teaching rain and that's what you do when you're planting a crop you have a planting rain and it makes the ground ready for planting and then and then when the seed starts coming up there comes a last rain to carry it to harvest called a harvest rain or a latter rain i'm talking in nature now when that harvest rain comes then you don't want another rain after that because now the grain starts going forward the shock pulls back the grain goes out into the presence of the sun it was that harvest rain that allowed that and now all you want is to have sunny skies and let the sun bake out all the immaturity and break all the green out of that grain and get it ready for harvest time listen friends our latter rain when the seals were open and christ is among us what more revival are you looking for what more do you think god can do than he's already done we're not looking for something coming i don't need an eighth messenger i don't need a new doctrine i already have the revival the bride's revival why am i still here 50 years later because we're still getting the grain baked out we're still being matured and guess what the world is also showing its fruit because they also had their latter rain also and that's why you see the madness today today you see a line of demarcation between the bride and the rest of the world more sharply than it's ever been we're becoming so stand out now you can't even hide it anymore in fact is if people don't know you're different you are backslid i just say it to your face and to the camera if people don't know that you follow a unique message for this hour you are living backslid you have failed to go on in christ so that because you're supposed to be a ripe harvest ready for the grain and people should be able to see that they might not understand it but they should be able to notice it so so we that's that there there you come today that's where we're at and then brother branham so then he goes from now he said now he's dividing the seed it's not just global harvest it's not just global seed now wait a minute we got to dissect this there's a seed under billy graham there's a seed under pentecostalism there's a seed of the word they all got a form of rain they all got a ladder rain and now if that's true then they're all in harvest time the tares don't forget the tares are binded bound for the burning before the grain goes to the garner what are you seeing in the world today you're seeing the gathering of the tares but there's a bread gathering around the carcass of the word hallelujah and so you you you've got he talks about billy graham and what was his ministry now if you're loved billy graham i don't mean to hurt your feelings brother branham didn't wasn't disparaging billy graham he thought he was a great man of god but you understand his message was sent on purpose to blind the last day people i never got that i thought he's preaching salvation how does that blind the people until i went to his billy graham libraries museum in near charlotte north carolina and when i toured that place and i see all these pictures i see billy graham and he's with all of the hollywood elites and all the political elites and he's with jfk and he's writing in a card all the presidents from then on every president wants to talk to him you know his son today is leading a big prayer vigil on the capitol wonderful nothing evil to say about any of that but you have to understand that it blinded the people because billy who i my own personal opinion is he certainly had an experience with the lord but at least to the level that god would allow it whatever it was i'm sure he's saved now whether he you know is he gonna be part of the bride i don't think so but he that that doesn't mean he can't be saved you understand that just comes down to election friends you can't choose that you don't even choose christ christ said you haven't chosen me i chose you for the bride the elected lady she doesn't really have a choice to make her only choice is once she's taken as a wife her only choice is then as brother matt was preaching this morning in sunday school is to surrender and let the word let her allow her life to be uh to be come the visible word of god and so so he he took them to see they were blinded because that they they took it to mean that all i have to do is confess that jesus christ is the son of god who died for me and i'm i'm in i'm in dr graham that's right you're in i just have to have faith that's right through faith apart from your works that's all true that's all true but what what caught them was that they took that to mean a mental experience that that that it was a mental acceptance it wasn't a revealed truth because he he told them there's no need to go on to the holy ghost and so they don't they don't believe they need to they believe all i got to do is confess but but i mean if they would just go back i don't know i mean i mean you know it's such a blinding doctrine i look back and i go how could even dr graham not see if you go back to the book of leviticus which is which is the old testament version of the four gospels because the whole thing's about christ and so if you go into leviticus 6 you know one of the things they were commanded to do that this fire that is on the altar these sacrifices have to be burned and you can never let this fire go out told them three different times in the sixth chapter this fire is perpetual don't ever let it go out and so we find that then you go to chapter nine and you find that it's that the the presence of god comes out of the holy place and and puts the fire on the altar so it's it's actually the fire the fire indicates uh god's presence because and and when they so when they bring their sacrifice the first thing you've got to do is you you've got a a a brazen altar and then behind that you've got a brazen labor and that's where the priest washes so you've got to be justified sanctified you've got to be baptized i mean to say and then you go into the holy place and in the holy place you have the menorah you have the table of shoe bread you have all these things because that's sanctification it's candle light it's it's church ages light you understand it's not that that'll church age light isn't shining in beyond the veil beyond the veil is shekinah beyond the veil is christ beyond the veil is revelation 4 revelation 5 isaiah 60. hallelujah you've got to go beyond that veil you can't just come and and and the pride and soul so so it's showing that that when they bring their offering and if you look if you go back and read i'm not going to take the time to read it today but if you go back and you read chapter 9 of leviticus you find that when they come in here's the bullock you've got to take the offering go take the fat and the kidneys and it's got to be burned and then and then with the blood without the camp and it comes all the way down and then then here comes god to testify in the last verse of chapter 9 he comes roaring out can you give me leviticus 9 the last verse brother kevin i think is verse 24. i just want to read it for the people the last verse of leviticus 9. this is all from memory i hope i'm correct yeah and there came a fire out from before the lord and consumed upon the altar notice consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat which when all the people saw they shouted and fell on their faces so the fire of god's presence consumes an offering that was already partially burnt when it came in it got put on the altar you understand when you repent that's a work of the holy ghost you understand this is all a work of the holy ghost but you can't stop there the holy fire had to come out because the presence of god it's not going to leave you partially burnt it's going to consume you it's going to completely annihilate your old nature and you're going to become a brand new creation in christ jesus and that fire followed them the entire 40 years and even after the wilderness because they were still offering sacrifices on the other side all the way up to solomon's day in second chronicles and when solomon built the temple the fire of god came out again and lit the altar hallelujah and that's where billy graham didn't take them to he took them to a repentance and their offering was brought and they really meant it and it was even partially burned but it wasn't consumed the holy ghost consumes you and so today they're blind they don't know i gotta they're they're still living in their old nature they've just been reformed and then as if poor mankind as if that ain't bad enough then oral roberts and that whole pentecostal movement they start they start telling them that you know extravagant wealth is the answer and they start chasing money in big buildings and big programs satellite tv and all kinds of you know jazz and pizzazz and big lights and money money you know wealth indicates spirituality name it claim it you know and that's why you see around the pentecostal movements of today that's why you see all these charlatans flying around in their learjet and they only fly around and lear jet a because learjet b's getting an oil change and and and and then and then they're driving around in their big limousines and their big motorcades and oh i have to do it because if i had to if i couldn't fly everywhere i just have to stop my ministry what vomit what vomit and they get up there and shake things and signs and wonders and pentecost will jump around them and so today today you know what you got today you've got a a political system because brother branham said that it's a try it's a it's a triple union of religious power political power and demon power and so here you've got a president and he's got evangelicals in one ear telling him all he's got to do is say jesus was the son of god and then you've got pentecostals in the other ear saying hey you're a rich man you're wealthy you're savvy you must be a christian and and and uh and the whole evangelical and pentecostal world puts a whoremonger in the office they don't care that he's a vile man they don't care that he the of the nasty horrible things that he does and and they they tell him you're our man you understand what brother branham was talking about brother branham said you've sowed to that that's what you wanted that's what god gave you now what are you going to do with it oh i'm saying and then on the other side you've got this communist movement and everybody's worried about that and i just hear a prophet saying ah communism ain't nothing it said what what they don't understand is they're all in the bed together and rome built the bedroom and rome built the bed and they're all rolling around under the covers together no wonder i'm not a part of it no wonder i don't care what happens in this political climate i don't care who's elected i'm not part of that that's not my life let them let them go let them have it i'm i've been founded on the word of god hallelujah i only care about the word of god thank god we have a an hour that we have arrived at where this is supreme in the mind of god's elected people hallelujah i don't care what they do it doesn't matter to me who's going to get elected whoever god needs to be in the office he's going to do exactly what god wants him to do they're all puppets in the hand of my father hallelujah i'm glad there's a word revival in this hour i'm glad there's a perfect faith that can lift you up out of the shadows you think you think they care they don't care it's all political they got they got black lives matter political movement they don't care that much about black lives all they've done is they did that in the 1960s women's liberation hijacked the civil rights movement go read your history women started going in the street and offended african-americans i if you've ever read dr steele's book uh on shame and he breaks this down he's an african-american scholar and he breaks it down and he's saying listen listen my people he calls him his people that's not me that's him and he says they've been lying to us all along he said what happened and he tells the story he said that women's lib saw the success of the civil rights movement and even and even brother branham talks about how that communism had infiltrated it and it was inspired by communists and so so we find but yet it's still a noble cause equality under the law and justice for all is a noble cause on any planet at any time that's a noble cause and we support that noble cause there should be equality thank god there's coming a millennium and there's gonna be equality and justice for all you're never going to get peace till jesus comes and and so you find then that that that that he says the the women's liberation movement saw that and they jumped on board and started marching in the streets and started carrying their their you know their we wanted quality too you know we wanted quality too and the reason they needed to to say that and the reason our only reason a woman would feel that way she's not wired to feel that way the only reason she time starts feeling that way is when she gets abused by men because men are supposed to live like jesus and if she lives like if men live like boaz ruth isn't worried about equality she knows that if she gets boaz she gets the whole field the whole estate in the whole kingdom she doesn't have to fight for any rights boaz can't do enough for her now just remember that's how he feels about you as his bride you don't have to march and hold up signs jesus you promised to heal me now come and heal me now you don't have to beat on the doors of heaven you don't have to break things down all you got to do is raise up your hands and say lord i surrender all give me every promise in the word give me let it pour out upon my family upon my life upon my health hallelujah this is the privilege that we have today why would you live underprivileged people do it all the time sons and daughters of god live underprivileged victory right in front of you and won't reach out and take it i feel sorry for you hallelujah and so so we find that that that dr shield starts talking about how that they hijack that movement see that's what they always do that's what they've done today they take a they take an extension of the civil rights movement crying for justice and equality and and antifa jumps in and all the political now the whole thing becomes a political quagmire and this one's lying they're all lying all of them the the the race that's being happened today is who can lie the fastest who can tell the biggest one and make people believe it come on friends that's the truth that's the truth you two might not allow that on their side they might throw this this sermon off but that's the truth anyway they're all lying republic cons and democrats and independents it doesn't matter the only truth in the world today is christ hallelujah he's that's the only truth that's left there's the mind of christ the only thing that can guide you they even started carrying a sign dr steele starts talk about how that they carried a sign that that that uh repressed women are the new n word except they spelled out the word and the black people started going hold on y'all that's going a little too far but they didn't care by that time they didn't care about civil rights they only cared about their rights you understand and so you find that that okay let me let me i gotta find a stopping place so here we come 21st century half century after the seals more than half century more than half a century after the prophet's gone what are we doing what's it all about why are we still here are we waiting on something is something moving amongst us has something already happened yes yes and yes i'm waiting on a body change i don't have it yet i ain't stop until i get it don't bring me a fancy doctrine telling me that ain't coming if i'm in the millennium now i want a refund i want my money back all you people that have been paying ties so faithfully for years if i get up here and preach the millennium's past you need to demand a refund hey man and i'll run for the hills because i already gave it all away sorry i haven't gave your money all the way ain't got any more of it amen so so we find that that here we are in the harvest time now we're in the real harvest time i'm so glad because this is the real one this is the real one this is the one the whole church has waited on for years and and if you if you just look because remember jesus shows as the light and of several things as the lightning cometh out of the east shineth unto the west so shall it be the coming of the son of man this is the time when the eagles would gather around the carcass then he goes into luke as it was in the days of noah as it was in the days of lot and if you look at lot brother branham draws that so clearly and i don't have time to get into it today he draws that so clearly in spoken words original seed of of how that abraham stayed up there with melchizedek lot was down there in the city he got see lot got involved in politics he became like a judge you know he he he set on the supreme court there and so you know he's like a ruler he's like the mayor of the city he sits in the gate and makes and judges that's the way the east that's the way they did it in the east so he's all involved he's in the trenches of it and you say oh yeah that was all just that was all just homosexuality it was way more than that well it was perversion of at every level the homes were out of order children were out of order families jobs government laws everything and and if you i mean if you notice when the angels come into sodom here you've got one side of the government you know what he's you know what you know what lot's message was to them hey listen uh it's almost dark things get a little crazy at dark you can't stay out here on the streets because you need to come inside because when it gets dark rioters come they start breaking down doors they start crashing through things we've got a big political upheaval in come inside they will abuse you and you know what happened sure enough as soon as sun went down the rioting started the looting the burning they're trying to break in now you talk about looting they're trying to break in they don't want to steal uh you know they don't want to steal mp3 players and computers and flat screens they want to steal two men so they can have relations with them out in the street you're talking about this is the spirit that's on the age today at night time it's not even safe to be on the streets in some cities in the daytime you've got people quietly protesting that's their right that's what we want to allow them that's what america is about but at night then you get these hired activists who get bussed in and shipped in yeah you see and they've already proven all that i'm not here to preach on politics i'm just here to tell you you you need to be thanking god that you've been called up above it you've been called out of it friends praise the name of the lord you've been called out of it you know what we see it for what it is the world is in fear not the bride say the world said what is going on the bride goes well come here and i'll show you what's going on oh that can't be right really it's always been everything you're afraid of it describes it tells where it came from how it got here what's going to happen how it's going to go and what's going to happen to you if you stay in it thank god it also tells about that one came and took the book and opened the seals and loosed the seals and came down to a prophet and a prophet gave a message to a bride and a bride is eating the book hallelujah why because i'm not planning to stay here i'm not involved with here i'm going home i got a body change coming i got perfect faith surrounding me an atmosphere of perfect faith why because i've been made a partaker of the eternal flame i've had the fire of god that came out and consumed me that fire indicates the presence of god that's what it indicated because because they knew from deuteronomy uh i think four maybe by the jd my uh that god is a consuming fire i think deuteronomy 4 my god is a consuming fire so they they they know that the fire represents god's here because it's consuming the offering and i mean that that's why that john when he's preaching to the people baptizing he says when he comes he'll baptize you in fire and in the upper room guess what showed up fire tongues of fire what did it did what did it indicate the presence of almighty god was among the church that's what a prophet is sent for a prophet is sent to conduct you into the presence of god and so god sends a prophet because he's got to be here as a facilitator of a marriage what happens there's going to be an invisible union that the world doesn't know nothing about but who the married ones are we know what it's all about hallelujah oh stand up friends let's stand up i got to just stop my mind is just starting to blow up and blow it and blow up and i'll just keep going what an hour that we live in what a day there's never been a day like this day let's sing it brother andrew there's never been a day bradley come brother brad and uh there's never been a day like this day to me you know there's never been a light to shine so bright as this day this glorious day this is a glorious day i know there's madness on the streets i know it's chaos i know it's listen relax breathe it's supposed to be here say what's happening everything this said would what do we do everything this said do what will happen to us everything this said would happen don't worry we already got the script i knew it was coming before it got here i know what it is now that it is here i know where it'll end up it'll end up in a tribulation period why am i not afraid of that because when i read in here i go oh okay i don't go to that i i go out and rapture okay i'm good i'm good whoo i don't buy i don't go down with this ship i go up up up higher and higher i've already started going up i'm already in an order of ascending already ascending the devil's already descending he wasn't in revelation 5. he wasn't there he was in zechariah 3 accusing the brethren but in revelation 5 you've got john who's the bride strong angel who's a prophet of this day christ the one seated on the throne you've got a lamb coming forward to take a book you've got a sea of glass you've got the four and 20 elders the one thing you don't have is that old nasty devil you know why because revelation 12 shows that he's already been cast out spiritually speaking now he doesn't physically get lose his access until we physically go up but in the mind of god satan already has nothing to say about you you're already the apple of his eye you're already passed from death into life you're already the queen of heaven brother branham said in god's mind these things all finished up a long time ago you're already on the other side rejoicing hallelujah that's what this message has done people say why do you believe this message how could i not how why would i not believe it wow it gives me every answer that i need high notes sorry i didn't use you today amen couldn't probably got to some of it don't even know what i got to amen praise the lord let's sing brother brad there's never been a day there has never been a day like this day you have the words kept to me there has never been a day like this day i see i see oh there has never been a light that shines so bright as this day this glorious day sing it again now there has never been a day like this day [Music] like this day i see oh there has [Music] this glory tonight beautiful sing it again now with all your heart has never been a day like this [Music] what a testimony let's sing it again as a testimony [Music] oh i want the world to know that there's never [Music] oh there has never been a lie that shines so bright as this day this glorious day bow your heads with me over the building today brother brad you are singing that old uh hymn i forget now as you as i come out you remember what that was yeah let's play that with andrew switch to that and just be ready for it just play it for me in the background get ready to sing it brother brad i love that song i grew up hearing my mama sing this song we couldn't go into a church service without without them requesting her to sing it it means so much to me i couldn't hardly step on the platform just stood on the landing weeping saying lord oh what love is this how have you loved me like you have how do i find myself so privileged today so privileged when billions can't see what i see they don't even know it's there they don't even know to look for it and yet not only do i know it's there but i actually see it what a privilege oh let people today lay aside the cares of this life and run this race faithfully stop chasing the world lord help us today to stop chasing the world help me help this church those here in the visible audience those old across the stream lord whole other half of our assembly lord we we so miss assembling together father i i we want that back so bad we want to be back we want to be back in fellowship we want to have that your bride that's what she lives for so lord help us now strengthen our faith let us lay aside you know father maybe we've been a hard trial let us just lay it aside what difference does it make so we've got a sickness or an illness so we've had a suffered a loss so what i get it all back anyway i'm going to heaven i'm going in a rapture what difference what why why do i care what the devil has done whatever my father allowed him for my good teach me a lesson grow me mature me whatever it is lord let us just lay anything that's hindering our heart and our mind anything that's hindering us to have free worship to have free love for you to have the to be a conduit of the flow of the of the love of god may you just cleanse us of it lord a lot of times father [Music] trials can be so severe that's hard to do sometimes wounds can be so deep it's not it's easier said than done you know where you want to be mentally but getting there so lord we're asking today for a measure of that grace that was promised to us at the appearing of christ now we know we have his appearing we know it's that day it's that it that's what makes this day one of the things that makes it unique from all the other ages we don't have a further understanding of the revelation of jesus christ than the early church had they and paul understood all of that paul understood the rapture mystery he understood who melchizedek was he understood election there's nothing that that we even believe nothing a prophet even brought or ever preached that wasn't based on paul's teaching we do have a unique day there's never been a day quite like this one because now we are to finish fulfilling the unfulfilled parts that church fell away we're predestinated not to [Music] we will finish accomplishing that perfect image of christ and it will change our mortal bodies so we we know that we're in an age like has never been there's never an age promised to where satan was would be called the god of the age that was never paul's day there was never no it took a prophet in this day to to call the world condition satan's eden well it couldn't have been back two thousand years ago because satan needed six thousand years to accomplish it he didn't have it done in four thousand years he was just getting started so so there's never been a day like this day there's never been a people who will globally around the world this elect lady will take a flight she'll she'll be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye the dead in christ shall rise and we which are alive and remain there will be some who are alive and remain i plan to be one of those i'm alive and i remain a believer i am steadfast more today than at any other day of my life i feel like sometimes i feel like wow i have more failures than at any time in my life but lord the bar has been moved up but the grace is here so we all we have to do is avail ourselves of that love of god that grace that's here it is here it's among us i'm not waiting on it it's here now i don't need another revival i i i have the revival of the word so lord we just carry on day by day i i every day want to separate myself more and more from this world and all of its pursuits devices applaud its accomplishments i don't care about it lord i care about the people in it that i might win some that i might tell everybody about somebody who can help anybody grant that to us today lord god the word we've heard lord was covered a lot of ground and didn't cover anything exhaustively but it was the burden of the word on my heart and i feel satisfied that i've unburdened myself now maybe next time we can slow down and teach it and bring the quotes and the scriptures and draw it out lord because teaching establishes the church we need to know what it is we believe and why we believe it but lord we love you today for what you've given us today we want to rededicate our hearts and minds to say my goodness this thing's this thing's bigger than what i thought and i'm really involved in something here i really need to get on with it so help us lord today give us that zeal that we so need father that zeal for the word for the spirit of god we commit ourselves into your hands in jesus name amen do you love him sing it for us brother brad sing along for his great maybe you'd like to just slip a hand up to him right now [Music] oh listen before you go back out into the madness of the world why don't you just love him a little bit he goes beyond let him know you love him and you appreciate the highest [Music] debate [Music] thank god thank god
