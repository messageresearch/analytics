[3:17] you
[3:43] good morning everyone god bless you
[3:48] we are going to stand and pray to start
[3:51] i'm going to continue my subject on
[3:54] christian character part 11
[3:56] and this time though it will be on the
[3:57] theme of humility let's pray
[4:02] heavenly father we come to you now lord
[4:04] and we ask that you would just move in
[4:05] our hearts
[4:06] lord take your word and just reach it
[4:09] down
[4:10] deep deep into our souls lord
[4:14] that we might be pleasing to you that we
[4:17] might glorify you
[4:19] with our lives lord help us just to
[4:22] empty ourselves
[4:24] get ourselves out of the way lord that
[4:26] we each of us
[4:28] both speaker and hearer can be a vessel
[4:32] used for your glory we ask these things
[4:35] in jesus name
[4:37] amen first scripture we're going to look
[4:40] at as you're standing is isaiah
[4:42] 14 and we're going to look at 13 through
[4:45] 15.
[4:47] strange verse to start your
[4:50] subject of humility but i think you'll
[4:52] see where i'm going
[4:55] this is satan
[4:59] speaking for thou has said in thine
[5:02] heart
[5:03] i will ascend into heaven i will exalt
[5:05] my throne above the stars of god
[5:08] i will sit also upon the mount of the
[5:10] congregation
[5:11] in the sides of the north i will ascend
[5:15] above the heights of the clouds i will
[5:18] be like
[5:19] the most high yet thou shall be brought
[5:22] down to hell to the sides
[5:24] of the pit then genesis
[5:28] chapter 3 verse 4 and 5
[5:33] and the serpent said to the woman you
[5:36] shall not surely die
[5:39] and i'm going to read from the esv here
[5:44] for god knows that when you eat of it
[5:47] your eyes will be opened and you will be
[5:50] like
[5:51] elohim you'll be like god
[5:54] knowing good and evil amen may the lord
[5:58] add the blessing to the reading of his
[5:59] word you can be seated
[6:03] pride is the root
[6:06] of sin the first sins
[6:10] both in heaven and on earth
[6:13] starts with pride so if we take the
[6:17] up reverse of that what is the reverse
[6:21] of that
[6:22] humility humility and pride
[6:26] go together what they're the opposite
[6:29] of each other let's let's look more
[6:32] closely
[6:35] humility in the definition in webster
[6:38] dictionary says in ethics
[6:40] freedom from pride and arrogance
[6:42] humbleness of mind
[6:44] a moderate estimate of one's own worth
[6:47] in theology humility consists in
[6:50] lowliness of mind
[6:51] a deep sense of one's own unworthiness
[6:54] in the sight of god
[6:56] self-abasement penitence for sin and
[6:58] submission
[6:59] to the divine will so then we need to
[7:03] define
[7:04] pride webster's dictionary also
[7:08] this is from pride is inordinate
[7:11] self-esteem
[7:13] an unreasonable conceit of one's own
[7:16] superiority in talents beauty
[7:19] wealth accomplishments rank or elevation
[7:22] in office
[7:23] which manifests which manifests itself
[7:25] in lofty heirs
[7:27] distance reserve and often in contempt
[7:31] of one another
[7:36] andrew murray says this about humility
[7:40] the root of all virtue and grace of all
[7:43] faith and acceptable worship is that we
[7:45] know
[7:46] that we have nothing but what we receive
[7:50] and we bow in deepest humility to wait
[7:54] upon god for it i think humility
[7:58] is too often an overlooked
[8:00] characteristic
[8:01] of a believer
[8:05] but if you look closely and what what
[8:07] andrew murray just said is absolutely
[8:08] true
[8:09] it's the root of holiness
[8:13] and it's the foundation for the
[8:15] christian
[8:16] life without humility
[8:19] you're not even you can't even go to
[8:22] baptism
[8:24] you can't even be born again because it
[8:26] starts with repentance
[8:28] you you hear the word of god and it
[8:31] causes you to say
[8:32] oh i'm a sinner i'm i'm deserving
[8:37] of nothing but death and pain
[8:41] i repent of my sins i turn to without
[8:43] humbling ourselves
[8:46] you can't even take the first steps
[8:47] towards salvation
[8:50] so humility is really the root of every
[8:54] good work in a christian's life
[8:58] i want to think i want you to think
[8:59] about pride and humility
[9:02] together really it's a measurement those
[9:05] two things are a measurement
[9:07] of self think of our thermometer
[9:12] when the mercury climbs that means it's
[9:16] it's the temperature is getting higher
[9:18] right
[9:19] so when the mercury drops the
[9:21] temperature is getting lower
[9:23] so think of that as self when the
[9:27] mercury grows
[9:28] goes up self is getting filled up
[9:31] you're getting filled up with self it's
[9:33] a measure really pride and humility is a
[9:35] measurement
[9:36] of how much god is in your life
[9:40] so if there's if there's self there's no
[9:42] god
[9:43] but we're at the same time we're all in
[9:45] a process we're
[9:47] learning to get more and more
[9:50] and more and more humble christian
[9:52] growth
[9:53] doesn't make you more haughty more
[9:55] selfish christian growth makes you
[9:58] less on self
[10:01] and more on god and others so when the
[10:04] mercury goes down
[10:06] and it empties out now there's humility
[10:09] now there's room for god
[10:12] in your life the lower that mercury is
[10:16] the more there is of god
[10:17] the the more there in other words the
[10:19] more there is of humility
[10:21] emptying of self more god can flow
[10:25] through
[10:29] james 4 10 says humble yourselves
[10:32] in the sight of the lord and he shall
[10:35] lift you up
[10:37] that's the christian ethic if you want
[10:40] to be successful
[10:42] lose yourself in god
[10:46] you don't want to establish the self
[10:50] fight for the self you want to be in
[10:53] that position
[10:54] where you're getting you're surrendering
[10:57] yourself
[10:58] it's not it's not like buddhism
[11:01] where the self is erased and there's no
[11:03] more self and now you're one with the
[11:05] universe
[11:06] we're not talking about buddhism we're
[11:07] talking about christianity which is
[11:10] self surrender it's not that the self
[11:12] doesn't exist the self continues to
[11:14] exist
[11:15] it's just that the self now is totally
[11:17] satisfied
[11:18] in god because it's fully
[11:21] surrendered its life everything in its
[11:24] life
[11:25] to god that is where we find
[11:28] humility john newton the author of
[11:31] amazing grace says i'm persuaded that
[11:34] love and humility are the highest
[11:36] attainments in the school of christ
[11:38] and the brightest evidences that he is
[11:41] indeed our master
[11:44] john wesley says humility and patience
[11:47] are the surest proofs of the increase
[11:50] of love and
[11:53] andrew murray again in his book on
[11:56] holiness
[11:56] or his book on humility is here is the
[11:59] path
[12:00] to a higher life down
[12:04] lower down just as the water
[12:07] always seeks and fills the lowest place
[12:11] so the moment god finds men abased and
[12:14] empty
[12:15] his glory and power flow in to exalt
[12:19] and to bless do you want a revival
[12:22] in your life in the church
[12:25] this is the key it's not shouting and
[12:28] screaming
[12:29] it's surrendering more of yourself and
[12:31] saying i
[12:32] am nothing what i think
[12:36] what i want to do means nothing the only
[12:39] thing
[12:40] i want is god when that happens
[12:43] then you'll have a revival and you'll
[12:45] have a rival and you'll have a revival
[12:51] god himself is
[12:54] revealed in simplicity or humility
[12:58] if you go back and look at that sermon
[12:59] brother branham again over and over
[13:01] again
[13:01] interchanges the words god humbles
[13:04] himself
[13:04] god is revealed in humility
[13:08] psalm 113 5 and 6
[13:12] says this who is like unto the lord our
[13:15] god
[13:15] who dwelleth on high who humbles himself
[13:19] to behold the things that are in heaven
[13:22] and in the earth so god
[13:26] dwells on high and even looking on
[13:28] what's going on in heaven and on earth
[13:30] god is humbling himself so imagine
[13:34] god is coming to you to reveal himself
[13:37] to you
[13:38] he is coming in humility
[13:41] and further than that god always takes
[13:44] as paul says
[13:45] he takes the base things the things that
[13:48] are nothing
[13:50] in order to use them to reveal himself
[13:53] through
[13:58] in easton's bible dictionary it says
[14:00] that humility
[14:01] is a prominent christian grace it's a
[14:04] state of mind
[14:05] well pleasing to god it preserves the
[14:08] soul
[14:08] and tranquility and makes us patient
[14:10] under trials
[14:12] christ has set us an example of humility
[14:18] we should be led there too by a
[14:20] remembrance of our sins and by the
[14:21] thought that it is
[14:23] it is the way to honor and that the
[14:25] greatest promises are made
[14:27] to the humble it is a great paradox in
[14:31] christianity
[14:32] that it makes humility the avenue
[14:35] to glory in the world in the world
[14:38] pride and self promotion
[14:43] i mean think about social media think
[14:46] about
[14:46] our our republican president
[14:50] what what what do they do point to it's
[14:53] pointing to me
[14:54] our famous picture today is the
[14:58] selfie think about that i'm not saying
[15:01] don't take
[15:02] take pictures of yourself uh i'm just
[15:05] saying what's the
[15:06] what what is in our heart
[15:10] are we are we humble or are we
[15:14] just pointing to ourselves the the whole
[15:17] spirit of the age is point to yourself
[15:21] show off yourself self is most important
[15:24] it's the opposite of christianity don't
[15:27] young people
[15:28] old people all people don't get caught
[15:31] up
[15:32] in this self-centered life it's not
[15:35] about you
[15:38] god wants to use you to help other
[15:40] people
[15:42] that should be our focus in life is not
[15:44] ourselves
[15:45] but god and others so let's look at the
[15:48] example of humility that christ
[15:52] set starting with looking in philippians
[15:54] chapter 2 and we're going to
[15:56] look through verses 3
[15:59] to 11.
[16:03] let nothing be done through strife
[16:06] strife means
[16:08] selfish ambition and it implies
[16:12] rivalry so don't do anything through
[16:16] selfish ambition to get a leg up to get
[16:19] to be better than other people
[16:22] and then it says or vainglory vainglory
[16:25] means pride
[16:27] without proper basis empty conceit
[16:31] but in lowliness word lowliness means
[16:35] humility but in lowliness humility of
[16:39] mind
[16:40] let each esteem other better than
[16:42] themselves
[16:44] okay this is this is a start
[16:47] how are you going to look at the world
[16:50] how are you going to look at those
[16:52] around you what is your attitude of mind
[16:55] towards those i'm better than them i'm
[16:58] better than this one
[16:59] that's antichrist thinking god
[17:03] tells us commands us to think of other
[17:06] people
[17:07] as better than ourselves
[17:11] that that doesn't mean that we need to
[17:13] have we need to just
[17:16] hey i'm terrible i'm evil i'm bad you
[17:19] know people that
[17:20] that's false fake humility
[17:23] that that's a sure sign that they think
[17:25] a lot of themselves
[17:27] but no one else does and i'm feeling
[17:28] sorry for myself
[17:30] that's not humility humility is not
[17:34] thinking less of ourselves i think it
[17:35] was c.s lewis that said that
[17:37] it's not thinking uh thinking less of
[17:40] ourselves it's
[17:42] thinking of ourselves less in other
[17:45] words
[17:46] it's not about it's not about me and
[17:48] what i want i exist
[17:49] for the betterment of others
[17:54] verse 4 look not every man on his own
[17:57] things
[17:58] but every man also on the things
[18:02] of others this isn't saying that we need
[18:05] to abandon
[18:07] all property and and all concern about
[18:10] taking care of ourselves and our family
[18:13] what it's saying is
[18:14] of course you're going to think about
[18:16] the things that you need to take
[18:18] care of for yourself and for others
[18:19] that's part of our
[18:21] giving glory to god is taking care of
[18:24] our soul
[18:26] and presenting our our bodies as a
[18:28] living sacrifice presenting our
[18:30] cells outwardly which would reflect the
[18:33] reality that's on the inside
[18:35] it's not saying anything about that we
[18:37] shouldn't think about that
[18:39] what it's saying is when you're thinking
[18:40] about your own things
[18:42] don't just think about your own things
[18:45] also
[18:46] also think about the things of others
[18:50] in other words what is it saying back to
[18:52] the verse before
[18:53] think about the betterment and the help
[18:56] and the blessing of others in other
[18:58] words
[18:58] observe what's going on in the lives of
[19:01] people around you
[19:02] doesn't mean observe it and go tell
[19:04] everybody about it
[19:06] it means observe it and take action
[19:10] and start with prayer god what would you
[19:13] have me to do
[19:14] i see this person is lonely i see this
[19:16] person has a need
[19:18] i see this person needs a b and c
[19:22] lord what would i what should i do about
[19:24] that and he says do this then go do that
[19:27] it's not about looking on it and then
[19:29] spreading that to others or even going
[19:30] to the pastor and saying you need to do
[19:32] something
[19:33] it's it's saying pay attention
[19:37] to what's going on around you and help
[19:40] meet the needs
[19:41] of those who are hurting
[19:45] look not every man on his own things but
[19:47] every man on the things of others
[19:48] then he says let this mind it's the same
[19:51] subject it's not a different subject
[19:53] let this mind be in you which was also
[19:57] in christ jesus so here he's bringing
[20:01] the example who being in the form of god
[20:04] thought it not robbery to be equal
[20:07] with god in other words he didn't think
[20:10] it was a prize
[20:12] to be grasped and held on to to be equal
[20:15] with god he just was
[20:17] that's what he was but he knew that the
[20:19] way
[20:20] of being equal with god was this
[20:24] but made himself of no reputation
[20:28] and took upon him the form of a servant
[20:31] and was made in the likeness of men so
[20:34] his
[20:36] his response to being found in the form
[20:39] of a man was to take upon himself
[20:42] the form of a servant
[20:45] brother branham tells us he was god
[20:47] jesus was god on morpha
[20:50] god in form he was the visible
[20:53] expression of god he never stopped being
[20:55] that
[20:57] he it wasn't as though he put that aside
[21:00] when he was humble when he was
[21:03] serving when he was submitting himself
[21:07] that was expressing the
[21:10] the invisible god that was expressing
[21:14] the heart of god and was made in the
[21:17] likeness of men
[21:18] verse 8 and being found in fashion as a
[21:20] man
[21:21] he humbled himself and became obedient
[21:25] unto death
[21:26] even the death of the cross satan's way
[21:30] is to exalt self
[21:33] to gain prominence by putting yourself
[21:38] forward pushing yourself thrusting
[21:40] yourself
[21:41] into power and authority god's way
[21:45] of exaltation is lowering yourself
[21:49] and saying i'm i'm a lamb i want the
[21:52] dove
[21:54] god to lead me to lead me to the place
[21:58] that i'm going to be
[21:59] what was god's will for jesus christ
[22:01] death
[22:02] on the cross and he said not
[22:04] nevertheless not my will
[22:06] but thine be done it should be our
[22:08] prayer daily
[22:09] not my will thine be done
[22:12] humble yourself wherefore
[22:16] verse 9 god also hath highly exalted him
[22:19] and given him a name which is above
[22:21] every name that at the name of jesus
[22:24] every
[22:24] knee should bow of things in heaven and
[22:26] things in earth and things under the
[22:28] earth and that every tongue should
[22:29] confess that jesus christ
[22:31] is lord to the glory of god the father
[22:35] the way i think the prophet puts it this
[22:37] way the way
[22:38] up is down the way to success and
[22:42] exaltation is to humble yourselves to
[22:46] lower yourself
[22:47] down what does that look like though
[22:51] you know i hear the word humble and if
[22:53] some it for some reason it feels very
[22:56] intangible to me how do i really grasp
[22:59] what it means to humble myself how do i
[23:02] go about
[23:03] doing that there's a there's a false
[23:06] humility paul
[23:07] talks about it in the in his letter to
[23:09] the philippians
[23:11] there's a false humility that a person
[23:13] can put on
[23:15] but then there's a reality a real
[23:18] humility let's look at the life of jesus
[23:21] it'll tell us
[23:22] exactly what humility is john 5
[23:25] 19
[23:33] then answered jesus and said unto them
[23:35] verily verily i say unto you
[23:38] the son can do nothing of himself but
[23:41] what he seeth the father do
[23:43] for what things so ever he doeth these
[23:46] also
[23:46] doeth the son likewise
[23:49] i can do nothing of myself
[23:52] john 5 30
[23:57] i can of mine own self do nothing
[24:00] as i hear i judge and my judgment is
[24:03] just because
[24:04] i seek not mine own will but the will of
[24:07] the father
[24:08] which has sent me john 6
[24:16] 38.
[24:22] for i came down from heaven not
[24:25] to do mine own will but the will of him
[24:28] that sent me john
[24:32] 8 29
[24:40] and he that sent me is with me
[24:43] the father has not left me alone
[24:46] for i do always those things
[24:49] that please him do you want the presence
[24:53] of god in your life
[24:56] i do what's the secret jesus tells us
[24:59] for i do always those things that please
[25:03] him verse 50 of the same chapter
[25:07] john 8 50 and i seek not mine own glory
[25:12] there is one that seeketh and judgeth
[25:17] john 14 verse 10.
[25:28] believeth thou not that i am in the
[25:30] father
[25:31] and the father in me the words that i
[25:34] speak unto you i speak not of myself
[25:36] but the father that dwelleth in me he
[25:40] doeth the works
[25:44] we want to be one with god
[25:47] we want to have and to do that we have
[25:50] to have true
[25:51] humility and we want to be a vessel
[25:54] that he uses for his glory
[25:57] this is the key let's look at what jesus
[25:59] says i can do nothing
[26:03] i didn't come to do my own will
[26:06] i do always those things that please him
[26:09] i seek not my own glory
[26:12] i speak not of myself
[26:18] and i do the will of the father that
[26:21] sent me that is humility
[26:26] that it is not it is not
[26:30] again thinking you're terrible
[26:34] it's understanding who you are and
[26:37] and understanding the purpose god has
[26:41] for you
[26:42] and it's knowing that whatever that
[26:44] whatever you have
[26:45] comes from him and whatever you do you
[26:48] don't want to do anything
[26:50] unless it's him guiding you
[26:54] and leading you to do it in other words
[26:57] you've lost
[26:58] all sense of your own desires your own
[27:02] plan your own dreams you've thrown them
[27:04] in the dust
[27:05] and said i'm gods
[27:08] i am god's and we understand that that's
[27:11] not a path of
[27:13] joyless drudgery that's a path
[27:17] to happiness that's the path to joy
[27:21] the only real one the only one that
[27:23] lasts for all eternity
[27:26] brother branham says this in 1961
[27:28] perfect strength
[27:30] by perfect we weakness but we must all
[27:33] come in one way that's come
[27:35] knowing that we are nothing and he's all
[27:38] and being willing to surrender ourselves
[27:40] to him in order to receive
[27:41] benefits from him listen to this man who
[27:45] was a warrior had stripped himself
[27:48] amen if there's anything that our
[27:49] schools needs today if it's anything our
[27:51] churches needs today
[27:53] is a stripping of themselves of your own
[27:56] thoughts
[27:57] and your own abilities strip yourselves
[28:00] before god
[28:01] unless you try to do something within
[28:04] yourselves wow
[28:08] i hope you that gets down deep to us
[28:10] both here
[28:11] and the tape world too that you realize
[28:13] that you've got to become
[28:15] nothing not a know-it-all not a great
[28:18] somebody
[28:20] but a nobody amen
[28:23] i love that let's join the band of
[28:26] nobodies
[28:28] i want to be the first member i'm a
[28:31] nobody
[28:33] i'm nothing i'm not a know-it-all i'm
[28:35] not a great somebody
[28:37] you've got to get to a place that you
[28:39] you know that you're nothing
[28:41] and don't never rise above that for as
[28:44] soon as you
[28:44] rise above above it you rise above
[28:48] god wow
[28:51] when when we leave the path of humility
[28:54] we leave the path of god
[29:00] matthew 8 verse 18 verse 4
[29:06] whoever therefore shall humble himself
[29:08] as this little child
[29:10] the same is the greatest in the kingdom
[29:13] of heaven luke 14 11
[29:18] for whosoever exalteth himself shall be
[29:20] abased
[29:21] and he that humble himself humbleth
[29:24] himself
[29:25] shall be exalted
[29:29] if you humble yourselves that's the way
[29:31] to success with god
[29:32] if you take pride in yourself
[29:36] in who you are that's the way
[29:40] to be a based to put down in the dust
[29:45] in the sermon three witnesses in 1951
[29:47] brother branham says what is it friends
[29:49] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[29:51] and forever
[29:53] be humble let yourself be the lowest of
[29:55] all
[29:56] don't ever exalt yourself if you do
[29:58] you're going to become a beast
[30:00] humble yourself and god will lift you up
[30:04] don't figure that god owes you anything
[30:06] remember you
[30:07] owe him all right and we're not under
[30:10] obligation or god's not under obligation
[30:12] to us
[30:14] we are under obligation to god
[30:18] amen let's stand and pray
[30:24] gracious heavenly father we thank you
[30:25] lord for your word we asked lord that
[30:28] in in this humility that your power
[30:32] would come
[30:32] and be man manifested in us and through
[30:35] us lord
[30:36] help us to remember that we are nothing
[30:39] and that we would never rise above that
[30:41] place
[30:43] lord i pray that you would fill each one
[30:46] with your spirit
[30:47] that you would move in the service today
[30:49] lord as as you sow
[30:51] will to move help us to just
[30:55] push ourselves and our thoughts and our
[30:57] ideas out of the way that you might flow
[30:59] through us

[31:02] name amen
