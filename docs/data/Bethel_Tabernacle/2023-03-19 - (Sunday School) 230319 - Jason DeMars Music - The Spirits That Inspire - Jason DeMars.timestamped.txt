[0:00] Point Let's stand and read the word
[0:03] I'm going to look at
[0:04] Ephesians 5
[0:08] and my topic is music the spirits that
[0:11] inspire
[0:18] D be not drunk with wine wherein is
[0:20] excess
[0:22] or debauchery
[0:25] but be filled with the spirit
[0:27] speaking to yourselves in Psalms in
[0:29] hymns and spiritual songs singing and
[0:31] making melody in your heart to the Lord
[0:35] amen let's pray father we just come to
[0:38] you Lord and we want to commit this time
[0:39] to you yes that your Holy Spirit would
[0:41] come Lord and speak the word to our
[0:43] hearts father just uh
[0:46] pray that you'd bring this with clarity
[0:48] and understanding to it we ask in Jesus
[0:51] name amen it can be seated
[0:54] now my purpose of this Sunday school
[0:57] isn't to uh
[0:59] stand here and make judgments on any
[1:01] particular specific song or church
[1:05] that our church or any other message
[1:07] church is using I'm really not that's
[1:10] not even really my focus is uh
[1:14] what churches are doing or or so forth
[1:17] you know the the
[1:19] you may or may not be aware of different
[1:21] controversies that have have have went
[1:23] on and offended people so don't get go
[1:26] into vapor lock
[1:28] as I'm talking about music my main focus
[1:31] is worldly music
[1:33] and
[1:34] show basically giving you the framework
[1:36] of what music is and what the real
[1:40] purpose of music is so that you yourself
[1:42] can be led by the spirit
[1:44] and make make your own judgments
[1:48] uh based on the word of God and the
[1:51] leadership of the Holy Spirit and the
[1:53] character of Christ
[1:54] so
[1:56] and uh also if you're a parent to help
[1:59] you be able to lead your family
[2:01] correctly and give your kids a reason
[2:03] behind the rules
[2:07] so in the verse that we looked at there
[2:10] don't do not be drunk with wine wherein
[2:14] is excess or where which is debauchery
[2:17] you know there's a whole picture that
[2:19] goes into that in in the Greek culture
[2:22] it's it's it's being out of control and
[2:25] being under the influence of something
[2:27] else that is controlling you
[2:30] and so being filled with the spirit is
[2:33] but so it's the opposite and brother
[2:36] Branham says let me bring that quote
[2:38] right now
[2:40] and why are people so touched about
[2:42] that's what he done under the anointing
[2:44] the anointing is not emotion the
[2:46] anointing is supreme power in control
[2:49] knowing exactly what and how see so
[2:54] being filled with the spirit
[2:56] his supreme power under control
[2:58] right
[3:00] not your control but God's control
[3:03] you know and and God isn't leading you
[3:05] to act like a drunken person
[3:08] people say these are not drunk as you
[3:10] suppose but then what's the results
[3:11] they're speaking what the word of God in
[3:14] other languages
[3:16] they're declaring the gospel
[3:19] but then we see a key here that Paul
[3:22] gives us be filled with the spirit
[3:24] speaking to yourselves in Psalms and
[3:26] hymns so what is he saying one way that
[3:28] you can walk in the spirit and be filled
[3:32] with the spirit
[3:34] is by speaking to yourselves in Psalms
[3:38] and hymns and spiritual songs so music
[3:41] Godly music
[3:44] is a key to being filled with the spirit
[3:48] amen
[3:51] and so that's what we want to talk about
[3:53] we want to talk about music so
[3:56] music really bypasses the realm of
[3:59] thought
[4:01] it bypasses the mind and goes directly
[4:03] to the heart
[4:06] so it's critical that we need to be
[4:09] grounded in the word of God and in the
[4:12] wisdom of God regarding the type of
[4:14] music that we listen to I'm going to
[4:17] look at some
[4:18] things that worldly people have said
[4:20] about music and what their music is
[4:23] intended to do
[4:25] this is someone who's written about the
[4:27] history of music not necessarily he's a
[4:30] worldly person but but looking at the
[4:32] history of music and the science behind
[4:34] it says music is the language of
[4:36] languages it can be said that of all of
[4:39] the Arts there's none that more
[4:42] powerfully moves or changes the
[4:44] consciousness
[4:45] you see it's something that impacts you
[4:48] and it changes your realm of thinking
[4:51] what you think about
[4:53] the direction of your life
[4:57] David Crosby you old people like me know
[5:00] who this is I I showed this to the
[5:02] junior Youth and they all laughed I'm
[5:04] like who in the world is that yeah well
[5:09] he says this to Rolling Stone magazine
[5:11] through my through just my music I can
[5:13] alter my audience's value system and in
[5:16] effect steal them away from their
[5:18] parents
[5:24] Jimi Hendrix
[5:26] I can explain everything through music
[5:28] you hypnotize them so that they're in
[5:30] their original state and then I can
[5:33] change their minds to anything I want
[5:36] so that's the music this is not just
[5:38] talking about the words in the music
[5:39] because you'll hear that and Christians
[5:41] say well the words are good so it's fine
[5:44] no heavy metal has a message
[5:48] without words rap music has a message
[5:50] without words
[5:53] all of the pop music Etc et cetera
[5:55] there's all a message behind
[5:58] the very sound of the music
[6:05] what is the meaning of the word music
[6:07] has anybody ever looked at that
[6:09] it comes from the word muse
[6:12] and it means someone who embodies the
[6:15] spirit that inspires them
[6:17] you saw in my first screen I had
[6:20] this picture there it's it's a bigger
[6:23] picture and it has nine different
[6:25] Muses and these were in Greek culture
[6:29] spirits that entered into a person
[6:33] and inspired them to do what they do so
[6:36] looking at
[6:38] the meaning of music is it's
[6:43] um
[6:45] see where I had tracing the history and
[6:47] the Romanian the word music its Origins
[6:48] it speaks of the art given by the
[6:52] spirits that inspire
[6:56] so there's a spirit Behind the Music
[6:59] the type of music and it is inspiring
[7:02] that music and putting forward a
[7:06] specific
[7:06] message that is meant to produce a
[7:11] certain kind of effect on you
[7:20] which is exactly what Aristotle
[7:23] wrote
[7:24] music has the power of producing a
[7:26] certain effect on the moral character of
[7:29] the soul and if it has the power to do
[7:31] this it is clear that the young must be
[7:33] directed to music and must be educated
[7:36] in it
[7:37] whatever his purpose was behind that it
[7:41] really it really doesn't matter the
[7:43] point is what he's saying is is an
[7:45] accurate statement is young people need
[7:47] to be educated and receive an
[7:50] understanding of the purpose of music
[7:53] and understand the background of it
[7:56] otherwise they're going to get get in
[7:58] get thrust in this game and they're
[8:01] they're just upon being played with by
[8:03] the devil
[8:08] you probably can't read that I'm sorry
[8:10] I'll read it for you
[8:11] there seems to be in us a sort of
[8:13] affinity to musical modes and rhythms
[8:17] I'll just explain that a second there's
[8:19] something inside of us that responds to
[8:22] modes and rhythms
[8:24] it's it's
[8:26] like
[8:27] built into us are the receivers
[8:31] to take in what music is doing
[8:34] good or bad
[8:36] and so inside of us we take that in you
[8:39] you can't avoid that it's like eating
[8:42] food if all you eat is terrible food you
[8:44] get fat music is the same thing for all
[8:47] you listen to is awful music what are
[8:50] you going to do you're shaping your
[8:52] character according to what you're
[8:54] listening to
[8:55] so he says uh there seems to be in us a
[8:59] sort of affinity to musical modes and
[9:01] rhythms he says which ensures that we
[9:04] are affected in a certain manner
[9:06] as a tangible expression of intangible
[9:08] realities music also had the ability to
[9:11] sustain and cultivate moral rectitude
[9:16] rhythms and Melody contain
[9:18] representations of anger and mildness
[9:20] and also of courage and Temperance and
[9:22] all their opposites and other ethical
[9:24] qualities again that's a very
[9:27] good way to express it music will
[9:31] encourage you depress you make you angry
[9:34] it can impact on your emotions all this
[9:37] way and that's why I say it bypasses
[9:38] your mind
[9:39] you're going to listen to this music and
[9:42] it don't matter if you say I don't like
[9:44] it you're in the grocery store
[9:46] you you hear music you can't avoid these
[9:48] things you go to the restaurant you
[9:50] can't avoid it you're trying to stop
[9:52] that and saying Lord give me strength to
[9:55] overcome I remember
[9:57] Avery as a little girl being so
[9:59] sensitive to these things we'd go into a
[10:01] restaurant she'd be a basket case at the
[10:03] restaurant I'm like just tune it out and
[10:05] I'm like how in the world is she gonna
[10:06] do that
[10:07] we gotta eat dinner here what are we
[10:10] gonna do and this music is coming and
[10:12] she's so
[10:13] Disturbed and affected and we got to go
[10:15] out three or four times and pray over
[10:17] her because this horrible music is there
[10:20] and and she's in the state the right
[10:23] State of Mind this is this is bothering
[10:25] me making me upset it's like brother
[10:27] Brandon said turn that garbage off it
[10:29] makes me so nervous
[10:30] and that's exactly it is it's bypassing
[10:33] our brain going to our heart producing
[10:36] an effect whether you want to or not
[10:40] you know as any of us this is any of us
[10:43] but as young people
[10:45] the devil will whisper in your ear this
[10:47] music sounds really good he he still
[10:49] tries to whisper those things to me
[10:52] based on music I used to like from the
[10:53] past
[10:56] that sounds really good I like it
[10:58] you start you don't even think you start
[11:00] tapping your foot you're like oh what am
[11:02] I what is this garbage
[11:06] you know it bypasses reason
[11:10] oh and then the devil will say the words
[11:11] don't really matter you just like the
[11:13] sound
[11:14] well that's just the start again this
[11:17] has been said by every preacher that's
[11:18] ever probably ever stood behind this
[11:20] Pulpit is the devil don't just give you
[11:22] the worst thing in front of you and say
[11:24] you want this horrible thing do you want
[11:26] to die not really no I don't want that
[11:29] no he offers look at this this is real
[11:32] life
[11:33] this is you'll enjoy this listen to this
[11:36] sound it's similar to this or it's
[11:39] similar you like that
[11:40] the words don't matter
[11:42] you know I
[11:47] poor young people living in this age
[11:48] it's so deceiving it's so evil and
[11:52] my own kids you're going to the grocery
[11:55] store and you're hearing this music over
[11:56] and over again and all of a sudden you
[11:57] hear your kid saying words of a song and
[12:00] you look it up and you're like do you
[12:01] know what are you doing listening well I
[12:04] hear it every day in the grocery store
[12:06] I'm not listening to that on at home you
[12:09] sure
[12:10] and and what what is it it's these
[12:13] things that are coming into them they
[12:14] don't even know what they're doing they
[12:16] don't know the spirit behind it and and
[12:19] they're getting into that and then if if
[12:21] we as parents aren't diligent
[12:23] they'll go long way down the road I went
[12:26] long way down the road
[12:32] and remember and I'm not I'm not trying
[12:34] to
[12:35] pigeon in on anybody or anything I'm
[12:38] just making the statement brother banham
[12:40] says the two spirits in the last days
[12:42] will be so close together that will
[12:45] deceive the very elective possible
[12:47] there's two Spirits working in the
[12:49] framework of Christianity in music
[12:53] to direct young people and all of us in
[12:56] one path or another
[12:57] we have to be wise
[12:59] I'm not here to tell you and point out
[13:01] this group this one this song no it's
[13:04] not that I agree with what brother Matt
[13:06] said if you heard him speak about
[13:08] music and worship and and taking taking
[13:11] songs and bringing them and and
[13:13] adjusting them to the right right beat
[13:15] and the right sound to create the right
[13:18] atmosphere I agree with that
[13:19] but but there is a great need to that in
[13:23] itself statement shows there's a great
[13:26] need to be wise and careful about this
[13:28] because it is two spirits and one spirit
[13:32] is working to set you free
[13:34] and to give you Joy and one spirit is
[13:36] working to put you in bondage
[13:40] to evil
[13:42] and not evil like you you know Satan
[13:45] worship
[13:46] pure Satan worship of you know all the
[13:49] nonsense that they do
[13:51] but
[13:52] uh it is a Satan worship right
[13:56] but it looks good it looks nice
[13:59] but it leads to the same destination
[14:03] the kingdom of darkness is real
[14:07] and it's the source of all opposition to
[14:09] God
[14:11] Satan is the prince of the power of the
[14:13] air and the God of this evil age
[14:16] his purpose is to do what he stimulates
[14:20] the lusts of the Fallen Human Nature
[14:24] and music is one of his greatest tools
[14:27] to bypass
[14:29] the mind the reason Logic the word of
[14:32] God everything and go directly and deal
[14:35] with your lusts
[14:39] and he's wants what is he doing what is
[14:42] he doing what does he do through worldly
[14:43] music he blinds people's minds to the
[14:47] light of the glory of God that's his
[14:49] purpose bind them
[14:51] in this blinding wickedness of sin and
[14:56] seeking to fulfill their lusts and their
[14:57] desires
[15:01] and he slowly and he'll do this to
[15:03] Christians you know people in the world
[15:05] they grow up with
[15:07] parents that don't know the Lord
[15:09] and don't don't love God and don't
[15:11] hardly love their children
[15:14] in a real way they might say they love
[15:16] their children but
[15:18] they're just living their life and
[15:21] surviving what is it they're thrust into
[15:23] this music and what does it do it
[15:25] carries them on a path
[15:28] you know they start out
[15:30] with things that are
[15:33] so-called you know nice sounding and not
[15:37] too dark and it takes them down a
[15:39] horrible dark path I mean there's
[15:42] you look at
[15:44] the culture of music and world of music
[15:47] today you don't even want to look at it
[15:48] to be honest with you
[15:50] you can't even you can't even do it you
[15:52] can't the things that they do at the
[15:54] Super Bowl halftime show and the Grammys
[15:57] they're openly
[16:00] going after the devil and not even
[16:02] trying to hide it anymore
[16:06] um
[16:08] you know and and the the devil's job is
[16:11] to desensitize us to all those things
[16:14] and get us going in that direction you
[16:16] know you're a mature Christian no those
[16:19] things aren't going to bother you but as
[16:20] a young person man those things will
[16:22] grab a hold of you hard
[16:26] um
[16:27] part of that is just how young people
[16:29] are you're not your your brains aren't
[16:31] fully developed till you're 25. you're
[16:34] not you're you're making your decisions
[16:36] not based on thought
[16:39] and taking thought and using logic and
[16:41] reason you're actually the the seat of
[16:44] your decisions until your brain is fully
[16:46] developed is emotions
[16:48] so just imagine what the devil is doing
[16:50] he knows what he's doing
[16:52] a Young Person's their their decision
[16:54] making process is emotion so what does
[16:57] he do he tap goes directly at emotion
[17:01] through music
[17:02] and what does it do you can't even make
[17:04] decisions correctly
[17:08] Romans 8 6 this is from the NLT so
[17:11] letting your sinful nature control your
[17:13] mind leads to death but letting the
[17:18] spirit control your mind leads to life
[17:20] and Pace again these are the two spirits
[17:22] in the world
[17:23] the devil
[17:25] is using music the holy spirit is also
[17:29] using music right one will lead you to
[17:33] life and peace one leads to death
[17:37] it's as simple as that
[17:39] how do I judge whether this music is
[17:41] from God or not what is it leading you
[17:43] to
[17:44] life and peace or death
[17:48] no it's just fun it's not no
[17:52] it's not just fun there's no just fun
[17:54] the devil wants you to think this is
[17:56] just fun music there's a message behind
[17:59] it there's a spirit behind it and if you
[18:01] don't if you don't recognize that little
[18:04] it's too late
[18:07] the devil wants to defile your body your
[18:10] mind ruin your relationship with your
[18:12] parents with family
[18:14] defile your body destroy your future
[18:18] I mean just just think a basic thing how
[18:21] fortunate if you grew up with two
[18:24] parents
[18:25] that cared about you
[18:27] and the devil will do everything he can
[18:29] to twist your mind around to forget that
[18:32] little
[18:33] fact because right now it might not be
[18:35] too important to you but I'm telling you
[18:38] when you get to be an old guy like me
[18:42] you'll realize you'll you'll you'll shed
[18:45] many tears
[18:47] through your life realizing of
[18:50] thankfulness saying Lord you gave me two
[18:52] parents that cared about me things
[18:54] weren't perfect certainly neither parent
[18:56] my parents were perfect but they were
[18:58] there for me and they love they they
[19:00] cared about me and yet the devil does
[19:02] this he puts music he puts these things
[19:04] to get you to forget about those things
[19:06] but I don't care about that my parents
[19:09] just want to control me you know
[19:11] no there's two Spirits working one wants
[19:15] to control you and one wants to give you
[19:16] life and peace
[19:18] and your parents
[19:19] if I bet if there's I would be willing
[19:22] to wager this I'm not a betting man but
[19:27] if your parents are sitting here today
[19:29] going to this church they're wanting to
[19:31] get you under the control of the Holy
[19:34] Spirit
[19:35] which leads to life and peace so I mean
[19:39] you should be the most thankful person
[19:41] in the world
[19:42] you should be thanking God and thanking
[19:44] your parents every day
[19:48] where am I at I got five minutes to do
[19:51] with the other three quarters of this
[19:53] Robert Johnson
[19:55] he is the father of rock and roll
[19:59] what did he do he was a horrible guitar
[20:01] player
[20:03] his
[20:04] his bandmates couldn't wait until he
[20:06] left and he left for six to eight months
[20:08] but what happened when he came back he
[20:10] was of absolute absolute virtuoso
[20:14] when he returned what what happened he
[20:17] said that on a certain Crossroads in
[20:20] Mississippi
[20:21] that he got out of his car and he made a
[20:24] deal with the devil and said if you give
[20:26] me Talent
[20:27] and make me a great guitar player and
[20:31] famous I'll give you my soul
[20:34] and that's what he did he sold his soul
[20:36] to the devil that's the foundation of
[20:38] worldly rock and roll music
[20:40] is a man that sold his soul to the devil
[20:44] you know lived lived
[20:48] lived until he's 27. died a terrible
[20:52] death probably murdered but they don't
[20:54] even really know
[20:56] studies show when you listen to rock and
[20:58] rock music and even some contemporary
[21:01] Christian music
[21:02] rats have a difficult time completing
[21:05] the maze in other words it limits their
[21:08] ability to think and discern the right
[21:10] choices
[21:13] put that into
[21:14] rock rap country all the pop music it's
[21:19] going to put young people and all of us
[21:23] in a position where we can't make
[21:26] the right choices we're under confusion
[21:30] but in these same studies these rats
[21:34] listening to Godly music or classical
[21:36] music it actually increased their
[21:38] ability to complete the maze in one of
[21:41] the studies when they played heavy metal
[21:43] it uh to the to the rats they actually
[21:46] started eating each other instead of
[21:48] completing the maze
[21:54] and you there's no way you can read that
[21:58] I'm sorry about that so this is Exodus
[22:02] 32
[22:03] 17-19 and it's just showing
[22:06] there's there's a there's a sound Behind
[22:09] the Music
[22:11] and when Joshua heard the noise of the
[22:13] people as they shouted he said unto
[22:15] Moses there's a noise of war in the camp
[22:17] so there's that's the sound that's
[22:19] coming to Moses as he's coming out of
[22:21] the mountain coming from the presence of
[22:22] God here's the people what are they
[22:24] doing it's they're it's idol worship
[22:26] it's Pagan worship they're worshiping
[22:28] the golden calf and whatever other
[22:30] debauchery they're doing
[22:32] Joshua says it's war and he and Moses
[22:35] says it's not the voice of them that
[22:37] shout for Mastery neither is it the
[22:38] voice of them that cry for being
[22:40] overcome but the noise of them that sing
[22:43] do I hear so here is their singing the
[22:47] singing was like a war
[22:53] and I have a number of quotes I man I
[22:55] just can't get to all of them
[23:00] everyone's familiar with how brother
[23:01] Branham in those days called out the
[23:05] Beatles and
[23:08] um
[23:09] Elvis Presley
[23:11] and Red Foley even
[23:13] and you go back and listen to their
[23:15] music and then compare it to many many
[23:17] uh contemporary Christian songs on the
[23:20] radio and you go oh uh this contemporary
[23:23] Christian music is a little bit worse
[23:25] than
[23:27] than Elvis Presley and Red Foley and the
[23:29] things that brother Branham called out
[23:31] what was it again it's the process of
[23:33] slowly deceiving slowly bringing this
[23:37] process if the devil would have went
[23:39] straight to death metal
[23:41] everybody what's this trash no they it
[23:44] was just a little different than what
[23:47] they were Hearing in church
[23:49] right but with different words different
[23:51] purpose behind it
[23:55] I want to finish with
[23:57] the story of
[24:00] Saul and David first Samuel 16.
[24:05] but the spirit of the Lord departed from
[24:07] Saul in an evil spirit from the Lord
[24:09] troubled him
[24:12] and Saul's servant said unto him behold
[24:14] now an evil spirit from God troubleth
[24:16] thee
[24:17] let our Lord Now command thy servants
[24:20] which are before thee to seek out a man
[24:23] who was a cunning player on a harp
[24:25] notice what the Servants of Saul were
[24:27] good servants the Servants of the King
[24:30] today would say let's find a
[24:31] psychiatrist let's get you on medication
[24:34] maybe if you try some drugs it'll it'll
[24:37] help you out
[24:39] and what what it what is it what is what
[24:42] do they give
[24:43] there to Saul find out someone that
[24:46] plays a harp
[24:47] but even more than that and it shall
[24:49] come to pass when the evil spirit from
[24:50] God is upon thee that he shall play with
[24:52] his hand Thou shalt be well
[24:55] and Saul said unto his servants provide
[24:57] me now a man that can play well and
[24:59] bring him to me that answered one of the
[25:02] servants and said behold I have seen a
[25:03] son of Jesse the bethlehemite
[25:05] that is cunning and playing listen
[25:08] it's important to know the character of
[25:11] the person that's playing the music
[25:13] notice what what we have here you want
[25:17] you want to be delivered from Spirits
[25:21] there's a spirit that comes on Saul
[25:24] and it's troubling him and he wants to
[25:26] get free from that what do they do music
[25:28] immediately their mind went to music
[25:31] which is correct
[25:34] bring me someone who's skilled on the
[25:36] heart but I don't want we don't we don't
[25:37] want just you know some fly by night we
[25:40] want someone with a real solid
[25:42] relationship with Christ that's
[25:45] following the word of God that has an
[25:47] experience with God that has seen God
[25:48] move in their life
[25:52] that's cunning and playing he's good at
[25:54] playing and a mighty Valiant man and a
[25:57] man of war and prudent in manners and a
[26:00] comely person and the most important the
[26:03] Lord is with him
[26:07] wherefore Saul sent Messengers unto
[26:10] Jesse and said send me David thy son
[26:12] which is with the Sheep
[26:14] and we'll skip down
[26:16] and David came to Saul and stood before
[26:18] him and he loved him greatly and he
[26:19] became his armor Bearer
[26:22] and Saul sent to Jesse saying let David
[26:25] I pray thee stand before me for he have
[26:27] found favor in my sight
[26:29] and it came to pass when the evil spirit
[26:31] from God was upon Saul that David took a
[26:35] harp and played with his hand so Saul
[26:39] was refreshed and was well and the evil
[26:43] spirit departed from him music there's a
[26:47] spirit behind that music and that spirit
[26:51] is part of a war
[26:53] remember that there's a war taking place
[26:55] evil spirits are trying to take control
[26:57] by the by the power of the Holy Spirit
[27:00] behind God a Godly person bringing Godly
[27:04] music The Devil is chased away
[27:08] so here what here what do we see
[27:10] what is God's purpose for music this is
[27:14] where I want to close
[27:15] what is what is God's plan what is he
[27:18] trying to do with music box says the end
[27:22] or purpose of all music should be the
[27:23] glory of God and the refreshment of the
[27:27] human Spirit that's exactly scripture
[27:30] there's not another purpose besides that
[27:32] music has to be glorifying God so if you
[27:35] want to find out is this music worldly
[27:37] or is it from God is it glorifying God
[27:41] and then the second is is it refreshing
[27:44] my spirit
[27:46] those are the two things that's exactly
[27:47] what and Saul was refreshed David took a
[27:50] heart played with his hand of course
[27:52] David was not just merely playing with a
[27:54] harp he was singing worship to the Lord
[27:57] he was glorifying God with his harp and
[28:00] with his words and by this
[28:03] Saul was refreshed God was glorified his
[28:06] power was put on display and manifested
[28:09] through music
[28:11] the devil was chased away and a man was
[28:13] set free so you believe that music is
[28:16] important
[28:17] it's not just a side thing a person can
[28:19] be in in the worship this morning and be
[28:22] set free from an evil spirit
[28:24] that's the purpose of Music let's stand
[28:27] and pray
[28:31] father we love you Lord we thank you
[28:33] that you gave us this gift
[28:35] of Music Lord help us to use it right
[28:38] help us to honor and glorify you lord
[28:41] lord use it and move through it Lord in
[28:44] a supernatural way this morning and and
[28:46] through your word as well father we ask
[28:48] that you had set the captives and the
[28:50] prisoners free Lord and help us to grow
[28:53] in our walk with you
[28:55] we commit ourselves to you commit the
[28:57] service to You For Your Glory we ask in
[28:59] Jesus name amen
