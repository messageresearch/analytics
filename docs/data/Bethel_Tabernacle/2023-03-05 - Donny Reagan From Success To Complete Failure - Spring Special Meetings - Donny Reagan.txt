the word are your hearts ready [Music] [Music] all right foreign [Music] [Music] every praise the Lord the Lord Jesus a lot of wonderful consolation that is turned to Ephesians chapter six if you would verse 11. and greet you tonight again the name of the Lord what a privilege it is for us to be gathered here in this this place in his presence Ephesians chapter 6 verse 11 will read down through verses 13. put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against The Wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities and Powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places and the word high actually is Heavenly spiritual wickedness in Heavenly places wherefore taken unto you the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstanding the evil day you see those who just come to the Lord Jesus and they never go any farther than the cross I feel sorry for them brother Jason preached it at our church several years ago about the cross and what a great opening that the cross was to Eternity but the cross was not the end of it the cross was actually the beginning that's right I'm glad the message of the hour has helped us to see that wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day in the evil day I want you to notice the way Paul writes it as if though that it wasn't even in his time yet but there was coming a time when it was going to be so evil and having done all to stand let's pray together truly heavenly father that is our desire we know lord it's not just what we've done 10 years ago it's not how faithful we were 20 years ago but we want to be faithful to the very end Lord God for we know many of those which were brought out of the land of Egypt the Bible tells us you later destroyed them so we know father that Redemption has two parts coming out of and going into many people as the prophet tells us and how can overcome they left the world they left many things of the world and he said so did Lot's wife I've always thought it a Marvel in Reading Luke 17 that after you spoke about the coming of the son of man and the great sign that would be revealed in the last day then you say these words remember Lot's wife so after the son of man is going to be revealed then that's when we're supposed to remember Lot's wife I find it amazing Lord you never told us to remember Sarah you never told us to remember Rebecca Rachel Rahab many of the Great women of the Bible but you told us to remember Lot's wife so it shows that there will be people that will come out under the revealing of the son of man and they will turn back but we believe there's a people here tonight they're not going back they're going on we remember her and we remember we don't want nothing to do with her we don't want nothing to do with solder we know there's a great difference between a pillar of salt and a pillar of fire and that's what we're following tonight speak to us from your word father we pray in the name of the Lord Jesus and the Saints said amen God bless you you may be Paul encourages them to fight like real soldiers of God put on the whole armor of God that they might be able to withstand The Wiles of the devil the word Wiles actually means let me read this to you that which is traced out with method that which is traced out with message that which is well laid so it is a strategy it is something that is well sought something that is planned very well it pertains to Art and skill coming cunning devices attempts to delude or destroy so the thing Paul wanted the Believers in this age to be able to comprehend as well as for us today of course was that Satan is not necessarily going to have an open Warfare think of it most of us have never even seen the devil any y'all ever seen a demon you ever seen one well I have I hope you never have to I don't mind telling you but that's not normally the way Satan fights Satan fights covertly he fights in ambush he fights in the form of snares and traps he's too afraid actually to meet you face to face Satan was the original and true terrorist now we've been hearing a lot about Terror [Music] we heard a lot about that too didn't we that Devil Boy he's going to get his Hive burn again tonight [Applause] so Satan doesn't really carry out open Warfare and just come right up against you and get his weapons and hit you and stomp you and oh no no he's much more cunning than that as I said he's the original terrorist so he likes to lay his booby traps and his snares and all those sort of things to be able to meet the Christian Soldier so he advances covertly he comes in sneaking now you don't have to raise your hand to this but I wonder how many of us tonight would be honest and say some of the biggest mistakes you ever made as a Christian was a snare that was laid before you and you had no plan on becoming involved in this or that or the other whatever it was and yet it was just like it appeared and you walked right into it the next thing you know you're found in the middle of something and you say how in the world did I get in this type of a place well this is his specialty and this is the type of warfare that he carries out against the child of God but yet the Bible tells us that we are not ignorant concerning Satan's devices or his ways now as I mentioned to you last night that God has an intelligence and we know in Warfare that intelligence is a very important thing and according to what I've been able to read down through the years Israel has some of the best intelligence in the world as a matter of fact America and Israel they share to intelligence and Israel has you know the shenbet and they have the different ones it was there a couple of years ago with on a tour with brother Mike walls and our guide actually worked with the Mossad any of you that know the massage you know that the Messiah is part of the Secret Service so one day on our tour we got a couple hour delay well we didn't know exactly what it was but we just waited till he got back whenever he got back he kind of included Us in that they had actually sneaked into Iran and took in some secret documents right out from under their noses and he had to have an update because he's one of them upper guys in the Mossad so their intelligence is very very good but yet when it would come to this type of a battle it's easy to see Israel don't have a clue what's going on right now spiritually but yet God I believe God has some agents that are trained with Divine intelligence now I'm going to share something with you tonight that I've never told any other group of people I am a an agent for the CIA I am also an agent for the FBI the CIA that I work for is Christ intelligence agency the FBI that I'll work for is the firstborn intelligence agency well your pastor works for the same awesome some of these other brothers you do as well now you know what God wants to do is actually give us a little bit of his Divine intelligence that will help us to be a better Warrior a better soldier in the battle that we're in isn't that what we want if you don't believe that listen to Satan's heat in 1965 and brother Branham writing the introduction of that sermon brother Brandon will tell you said he thought about he'd hurt by the devil preaching he thought about what he would bring that night in such a blessing her mother never he said and he said he wanted to bring something to be a blessing to the people so he thought what could I bring that would help you to be a better Soldier and he said bring something to you that would help you to keep the punches off of you as much as possible wow wouldn't that be good to be able to keep the punch assault what is that that is God enlightening us with a little bit of divine intelligence to be able to help us to be a better Soldier whether we're men women boys or girls and what we are in and the Lord wants us to be able to continue and now we know that he's not going to eliminate all of our battles all of our trials all of our tests but what he does want us to do is to equip Us in such a way that we can be able to shed off as many of Satan's darts as possible as a pastor I believe in Repentance I believe in the mercy of God the grace of God I'm grateful that God is there to forgive us when we do wrong but I believe that we can live in such a way the Holy Ghost will not only help us and forgive us when we're wrong he will help us bypass and go around many of the pitfalls that Satan lays before us I don't want to just be a Christian that is all the time repenting and repenting and repenting and repenting I want to be the type of Christian that absolutely goes around something that the devil does instead of repenting I'm praising and citizen I'm so sorry I'm so sorry I'm so sorry I'm so sorry sure I've had to say I'm sorry a lot but I want to go on and become a better Christian where I don't spend so much of my time saying I'm sorry but I'm grateful I'm grateful I'm grateful you led me right around that you showed me and I went right isn't that what we want tonight now it's wonderful to know God in the way of repentance but I really believe God wants us to know him also in a way of divine intelligence that he helps us by his own spirit and he leads us in such a way and it totally dumbfounds the devil and Satan will may lay a trap for you for weeks or months at a time and the spirit of God the very day the devil is ready to spring that trap on you the spirit of God leads you right around that thing and them Devils go back down in hell I mean they're crying they're all tore up they don't know what in the world to do they put forth all this effort and they've done all of this stuff and you know what you're supposed to go down that way because methodically they timed you they watched you you repeat this over and over again but that day the spirit of God LED you another way and the devil was our waiting and you didn't show up Hallelujah well you see I believe that's what the message of the hour does I I don't think that the message of the hour just gives us a bunch of quotes I don't think the message this makes us smarter than the average denominational person I think it makes us more like the Lord Jesus I don't believe the Lord Jesus spent all of his life I'm sorry Father I'm sorry Father I'm sorry Father as a matter of fact I don't find no place he ever said that now I don't expect to be like him no I know I'm a human but I do sing the closer I get to him the more he will reveal to me Satan's tactics and I'm better able to understand the enemy that I'm dealing with and the church said now you see what Satan will do then is try to bring us into a spot to where that we fall into it over and over again now I said is every one of us our makeup he knows the sign hope he don't think I'm crazy now tonight but Satan knows the star you're born at her now absolutely when you you were born the stars were placed in heaven in a certain place and the prophet said well you said that's crazy no it's not God's Prophet said in 1964 you were born under a certain sign a certain star and he said that has something to do with you that sets what he called once your births pass now a person come to him asking him about the Holy Ghost now brother Adam said what I'd done was I went and seen the sign that person was born under and I've seen the birth path and that put them under a cross which put them under a four now don't ask me what that means because I don't have a clue but if I know he did so but I know that those things do affect us so Satan will watch us now you can you know it yourself that you go through certain cycles and there's certain strains that come in certain families and it's like that some people don't reach the that that effect of a certain strain in their family until they hit their 20s or their 30s or their 40s and you'll watch them they'll be doing good forever so long then all of a sudden they reach in that certain spot and it's like something just grabs a hold of them and they change and you say what in the world happened to them and it's a natural strength don't look at me so funny I'm just quoting what he said he said they're strange that runs in families oh you say but we got the Holy Ghost but your old stinking flesh ain't got it and my old stinking flesh ain't got it neither and that's why the Holy Ghost and the Soul wants to bring our flesh in subjection to the spirit of God is that right now you see Satan knows all this about humanity and remember he's been fighting these human battles for six thousand years I'm only 66 years old how in the world would I ever be able to meet an enemy which has been fighting and defeating Humanity for six Millennials long how could you as a Young Man a young woman ever meet such a foe like this this is the one who calls Moses to lose his temper and be kept out of the promised land this is the one that actually betrayed or deceived I should say Joshua for a little bit concerning the men of gibea whenever they showed up in Old garments and and they looked like they was from a foreign country and there was actually just right over the hill and yet Joshua the mighty General the devil was able to deceive that man and make a covenant with them should I go on this is the same one that deceives Samson this is the same one that Jeremiah whenever he said I'll speak no more in the name about the Lord so who are we to be able to meet such an enemy I'll tell you who we are we are a New Testament Holy Ghost Field children of God that on our own we are absolute complete failures but with him inside of us we are more than all the demons out of hell all of them joined together they better take note because there is an army of the Living God that are not survivors but they are more than conquerors now you see the Christian Warfare is against this struggle of strategies and Wilds now let us go back again a little bit if you don't mind and look at our enemy and get a little bit clearer view of who he is the prophet says it this way did you know in heaven that the devil was God's right hand man in the beginning Lucifer the son of the morning was given power and the reason that he brought sin into the world he was able to take something that God had created and perverted back into an evil thing now remember Satan is not a Creator he was everything that God was except for that so he cannot create his own Angels he cannot create his own church he cannot create all of these things so he must take what God has done and perverted to his own purpose again he says oh my notices what started all this trouble in the beginning God back before the foundation of the world was ever late seen what Satan done in his pride he went over in the north and set up a kingdom I don't know if you've ever looked at or not but it's amazing when you study directionally about the North and what the north is it was the north side of the Tabernacle whenever they built the Tabernacle and they wrapped it and they would have overlapping part of those skins it was on the North side that the overlapping was laid now that word is also used as a flank or the extremity or it was as the displaying the female part and it was that part by which the presence of God would enter into the holiest of holies so they would wrap that around and this was what Satan won I want God's church I want God's Property you know as well as I do any view that God has ever shown you his Divine favor and Satan has been watching you since you were a child he does not have a microscope or a pair of binoculars where you can look down in your soul and see if there's a seed or not but what he watches is God's love God's protection God's mercy and God's divine grace towards certain individuals he's watched that for Millennial now and he's able to tell by that that God has something special for that one that one that one or that one are you hearing me but not because of our flesh not because of our natural birth but he watches what the spirit of God does for you maybe God spares you when you as a child you should have died it was in an accident you should have been killed but you didn't something miraculously spared your life that's a great great thing is it not but it was also a footnote made down at Hell watch her watch him watch this watch that now before you might just been a normal baby a normal child but Supernatural is something by Divine sovereignty stepped in and kept you on All Odds were against you then Satan must learn how to watch those people because he's seen them how that God did it with David God did it with Daniel God did it with Jeremiah over and over again now watch the prophet says that in this Pride he went over in the north and set up a kingdom now watch what he done so while he's still in heaven remember he hasn't been kicked out yet and brother Jason was talking about it today and he was talking about how that Satan must have started preaching there to the angels and more than likely didn't just start out and I'll tell you God's the mean God and God's about God and God's this and that and the other but maybe you know we don't even know how long that this took it might have been one meeting as it were after another now these angels started coming and hearing the devil preach he might not have got up and said I'll tell you one thing I'm leading a Revolt tonight where the word go absolutely tired of standing against God we want to do it it might have been one one little saying I threw another little saying I to another little saying now notice the prophet said that he set up this Kingdom and he fought against Michael and his angels notice next paragraph the right hand man of almighty God was Lucifer the son of the morning the first God granted him almost co-workers with him he was a co-worker partly equal with him only Satan could not create God is the only Creator but Satan took something that God created and heard it perverted it back so he was a co-worker with God God's right-hand man if God wanted to talk was any of the Angelic beings he fellowshipped was Lucifer oh my goodness notice again question answer Satan was the original Archangel of God he once dwelt in heaven now listen he once was the greatest person in the heavens outside of God so here's God and here's Lucifer the next greatest person in heaven he was God's right hand man to Fellowship my goodness and he got puffed up in his heart now notice again in in this same one paragraph 73 so Lucifer is on the Earth today trying to work in the church to accomplish the same purpose that he started before the foundation of the world now remember the Angels fell before the foundation of the world was ever laid the Earth wasn't even formed yet oh no Lucifer in heaven tried to exalt himself and even be just a little higher than his boss you see this is why God hates Rebellion this is why God hates Rebellion when people rebel against God's divine order or God's Divine protocol God hates it why here he is the originator of it so whatever children rebel against their parents they don't understand and we're living in the age to wear Rebellion is what is absolutely pushed and flaunted in this day our government wanting to allow our children to have these operations on them that will change them from boys and girls and this and that even without the parents consent you've got to be kidding me I I thought this was America not red China I thought this was America not communism or Russia or something like that and yet look what they want to do what is it it is the Defiance of divine order and Satan tries to do the same thing right inside the message of the hour to where God Has Come men that are called of God and what does the devil do try to come right back around and say oh we don't need preachers no more we can just stay home we don't have to listen to No oh sorry sure tell us what to do you know where that comes from it comes right from the pits of hell it is not the anointing of the Holy Ghost mother random never told any such thing it is Antichrist in principle well I guess I might have to preaching amen myself too now notice so he wanted to be a little bit higher than his boss and he betrayed Michael so Satan then moves out of this position being second was not enough he had to be first or nothing so when he moves from his position he betrayed Michael when Eve moved from her position to becoming the head of the home she betrayed her husband when the serpent moved from his position now if you watch when God brought the creation on the earth the serpent mirrored what Lucifer mirrored in heaven so here was Lucifer being God's right-hand man to fellowship and the serpent was Adam's right hand man of Fellowship in the Garden of Eden so he didn't go to the lowest part of the creation but right next to God I hope you're going to listen to me tonight I'll tell your friends the anointed ones at the end time and our twin will not be a Baptist now come on every Revival has produced a set of twins you know what our twins going to do they're going to quote the prophet well here we go They're not going to stand up and quote Billy Graham you know some of these guys are Smiley preacher from down in Houston they're not going to stand up and quote this and that and the other of a denomination of a water what is our Trend going to look like they're going to look like a message preacher they're going to look like message people well I'm sorry but that's exactly what your twin is going to look like but it does not change the reality of God's word oh my now what's what Satan did was able to preach to these angels and whenever he did that then the Bible writes about them in the book of Jude and it says that they left their first estate now naturally when we think about a state we would think about a piece of property and all maybe whatever your idea of an estate would be down here I suppose sea grass about that tall tarpon's uh crocodiles or y'all got alligators that's right alligators um let me see Sand Gnats and uh you know a big old uh big white fence all around this beautiful beautiful Marsh and uh and that's your idea I'm going to stay well not me not me no I'm a Kentucky boy so my idea of an estate brother Jason might be something like that on the Versailles Road it should go out which is Route 60 out of Lexington and as you would leave from the Bluegrass airport there and you would keep going toward Versailles and you'll start seeing these white fences with all them thoroughbreds and you'd see all them beautiful Rolling Hills and then you go out about four miles out from a Pentecostal church I used to preach out there and you'll see this Castle sitting up on a hill this Castle was actually really a rich man I'm multi-millionaire which married a very young woman and this young woman's dream home was a castle so he built her a castle setting up on a hill it has a moat around him it has a bridge it has all kinds of things as you keep going you see this great big old beautiful barns well Secretariat come from and where all these fine racehorses and many of them barns they keep them in it's nauseous in the homes and you and I live in I know because I've had a brother-in-law that used to work there so in my idea you know that would be a mistake my great big rolling beautiful place but that was not what the Angels had but the Angels did have an estate something that God allocated to them in his great Mercy in order to give them a charge in his domain now remember the Primeval order uh that you and I know about in Genesis is very very vague and they know that it looks like there's two stages of the earth so maybe we'll get into it in the morning that in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness covered the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the waters and God said let there be light and there was light now we know that word the light is ore which means they come into existence and the prophet tells us in the seal book when that word is quoted let there be light that God does not actually creating the Sun the moon and the stars but they were already in existence but something had happened on the earth and through the earth into this Darkness so when we see the Earth appear there in Chapter 2 it is not in its original condition but something had happened on the earth what was it it's the same being right here he come down and walked on this earth when God was creating it when it was in its volcanic State now don't sit there and look at me funny because I got the quotes right in front of me I'll read them to you so there was a war that went on so God disposes of this enemy he loses this position as far as being the chair of them then the Angels come down with him they were kicked out of heaven the prophet mentions about this as far as a hurricane crossed the mystery he said speaking about the Devil he's building an intellectual Kingdom that will outshine Christ's little bitty flock a seat what did he did that with Fallen Angels the Bible said it was Fallen Angels who listened to Lucifer instead of Christ who they wants belonged to it ain't no wonder when people walk away from this word they become worse than they were before they ever got saved look at many of them all they may not in there so when the death the devil knows better than that but look at how they go to letting go of this and letting go of that look at their attitude first of all look at how they go to living look at how they go to crucifying everybody that don't believe what they've got to say well it's the truth is it notice again he says now listen Fallen Angels what kind of angels oh dear God looser Wesley Catholic Pentecostals who kept not the first estate do you understand one of the instruments that Satan is going to use and has used for decades in this message to cause such chaos fallen angels has crept in Among Us men Anointed with Fallen Angels spirits how does Lord Jesus who kept not their first estate like the Angels did has fell into organization like Lucifer's main hole at nicaea West it was a man of God but what followed him Fallen Angels got into it so it was a move of God at one time is that right A Move of God westernism was a genuine move of God in the earth and before they could proclamate that message Fallen Angels come in it and took preachers or lay it to you whoever more and they begin to use them under the name of wesleyism or methodism and it began to take an agenda who was it oh Lord children it was the same devil that preached his Gospel of Science and education to Eve in the Garden of Eden oh my what was the Angels versus had created beings of God but they fell for Lucifer's wisdom for Lucifer's wisdom and you see what they become fallen angels and organizations from Men of God Luther never started an organization once they never started one brother brother was certainly didn't serve what but we still got them around us and whether you like it or not you might also say Amen this message to itself will never make an organization no sir but the prophet never said the spirit of organization wouldn't come around us we've had them for years and years we've got all kinds of camps and all types of titles well what do you believe about the Thunders and what do you believe about how many Souls you got I could go on and on you've heard him you've been around some of you longer than I have and it's the same Spirit of organization to try to divide us to try to separate us where we won't even fellowship with one another won't even shake hands hardly with one another what is it Fallen Angels Fallen Angels men that got under the influence of demons out of hell and they begin to say and well the prophet said the prophet said the prophet said oh goodness notice this there's only one way provided by God he says Lucifer at the beginning wanted to build himself a kingdom which is greater and more beautiful than Michael's Kingdom Christ that was his ambition to achieve something like that and what did he get to do it by he took Fallen Angels who had lost their first estate he took that to do it with he's doing it with Fallen Angels following lucerne's falling Methodist Fallen Pentecostals oh you like it much better I guess if I stop there huh well let me update it and bring it on up to you fallen message preachers message preachers that stood in the pulpit and declare this message was a truth for years and years and what are some of them tonight blasting the same prophet of God they stood for blasting the same message they say they believe God have mercy on us may God help us that we don't turn our backs on this truth [Applause] notice as he goes on to say Lucifer is achieving today by man with those spirits in them Lord God we're going to be under the influence of one of two kings there's only really two powers in the Earth today two kings both of them wanting dominance King Jesus and King devil Lord God keep me Lord Jesus notice this God of this evil age it was Satan's ambition to be worshiped like God he took two thirds two-thirds of the stars of Heaven ascended himself notice his way is always up going up going up there's got to be above everything above everybody so it can look down on them send it himself above those stars and preached the devil preached and deceived two-thirds of them now can you imagine angels of God that never lied angels of God that never said one bad word in their life they never smoked they never committed never done anything wrong in their life and they stood there sat there whatever was that we said last night and whatever it was that he said you talking about a deceiver and then Angels sat there and they heard them they thought this is true this is true in the millennium he will be bound for a thousand years at the end of the Millennium he will be loosed out of his prison people will have lived in the Millennium for a thousand years think of it people in natural bodies not Saints not elect but people in natural bodies will live there for a thousand years they've been made to come to the house of God if they didn't come to church we as the sons of God said just because of that you don't get no rain on your garden is that what the Bible says they're supposed to come up to the Feast of Tabernacles then that whenever the thousand years are expired he will be loose out of his prison for a season he will go about on the earth deceiving them they have just lived a thousand years they have lived on the earth with glorified Saints and Immortal bodies they watched Jews you'll be standing there talking to him and that once you disappear because father sent you over there on the other side of the earth somewhere they watched the Lord Jesus they watch the great healing come upon the Earth they saw the Earth Changed by the power of God and at the end of that Thousand Years the devil will raise up out of his prison and go about and deceive millions of them they will be so deceived they will come up against the holy city can you imagine they will be so deceived they say I hate Jesus I hate him I hate Jason I hate Johnny I hate them saints that should be too hard for us to grasp people do it today notice this the prophet said notice his ambition he preached God of this evil age that kind of a scientific social educated Progressive gospel wow him and the devil has a gospel what's the word gospel mean good news well friends we are living in a progressive gospel age aren't we when everybody's going to heaven all the trans people all the boys loving boys girls loving girls everybody's smoking drink and run around doing whatever I don't care how they live but boy whenever they die it's like the Holy Angels From God come down out of heaven and packed her Souls away Holy Angels wouldn't touch their heart holy Angela put their hands on some of them sorry rotten whoremongers and liars and drunks and everything else if you ever walk down the streets of gold you're gonna live a life that reflects the Gospel of Jesus Christ amen God is not hard up that God has to accept every liar every adulterer ever a whoremonger into his kingdom straight is away and never is the gate that leads to eternal life [Applause] you can say wise it gets closer and closer Satan hates us more than ever before who knows how much longer we'll be able to use YouTube who knows how much longer we've done been flagged I'd be surprised if you ain't we've done been flagged by them foreign what you're going to do keep preaching the same thing of course oh what if they can't kill they kick me off I'll be obedient what now brother Tony you've got to use wisdom I call that compromise when I have to quit preaching against sin I'll come off the internet when I have to quit preaching against sin I'll come off of YouTube well come on because if I don't I won't leave this world in rapture um notices in Satan's Eden the God of this world today the worshiped person of this world today is Satan listen how it's come about and the people are ignorant of worshiping Satan but it's Satan impersonating himself as the church so he impersonates himself as the church see us the church and they worship Satan thinking they are worshiping God through the church but it's the way that Satan is in oh you say but wait a minute we preach the word look back here at my text tonight Satan was the one that preached the word Lord shielded and what word was he preaching he was quoting the message of her day selectively quoting it he didn't jump over and get Noah's message he didn't jump back or say that in the beginning God created the heavens of the earth he didn't jump back her 500 years or a thousand years but what did he do he caught the word of her day and said yay I want you to notice how he addresses her you see the Bible tells us in Genesis 1 in the beginning God chapter one God God God but when God creates a son then he reveals himself in his first compound family name Lord God Jehovah with his children Jehovah Adonai Jehovah Elohim the first compound revealing of his name the Lord God but when the devil come to Eve I want you to notice where he reverted back to yeh hath God said so take her back to an impersonal God a God that doesn't really love you a God that doesn't really care for you brother he's got you defeated right there if he makes you can believe that notice that would have not had one bit of effect on her until she took his words into her mind and in the womb of her heart she conceived and then she sent him right back out and said yay God he knew right there he had her he had already changed her view of Papa God he was no longer this loving wonderful father but he projected God to her that he was a mean cruel being that was trying to keep something from her very impersonal very uncaring and as soon as she said it then she turns right back around and said well God not Lord God instead of saying Satan you're a liar my father told me not to do this my father told me not to do that but what does she do she reshapes in her mind this image of this God by that one little statement God's been cruel to you young ladies to make you wear long hair wear dresses why it's so cruel for you all not to be able to smoke cigarettes I disagree I think it's cruel to smoke them oh y'all's young people's been kept from so much they are all types of sexual transmitted diseases they're being kept from being pregnated before they're married they're being kept from a lot of this and that and the other don't you sit there and look at me and tell me that we're robbing our young kids we're trying to keep our young kids so when they walk before the preacher and they get married to that boy or that girl amen that they'll be able to raise that Veil and kiss for the first time come on somebody they'll be able to look at one another and they they didn't give everything they had because they dressed like a street prostitute and they left nothing to the imagination but they Reserve theirself for their husband come on young people they Reserve themself for their wife they didn't go out there and live like a bunch of pigs and then come and say well I want a daughter of God no we want our daughters to marry Sons we want our sons to marry Daughters of God I don't think our boys have to go out to the Baptist Church and find them a while well I want to preach right now I don't think our sisters have to go down to the Episcopalian Church to find them a good man you need to find the right in the ranks of the word get you a Son of God that believes the word a Son of God that'll guide you a Son of God that'll raise your children in the house of the Lord foreign [Applause] Satan preaches his gospel oh God is love oh we just all love everything I love everybody what script are you on people have got more scripts and they've got scriptures in this day we're living in they'll say no pun intended brother Andrew you see Paul in using this in Ephesians 6 12 let's go to the scripture that Brothers if you don't mind for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities and Powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness and high places Paul uses a Greek athletic term wrestle the meaning is a contest between two and which each Endeavors to throw the other and which is decided when the victor is able to press and hold down his prostrate antagonist namely hold him down with his hand on his neck what a word to choose to describe your walk as a Christian the loser and a Greek wrestling contest no children can't you see the penalty can't you see the penalty if we lose this match we go blind [Music] see what's happening to people when the devil pins them down for so long then what does he do like Samson remember before Samson ever lost his sight naturally he lost it spiritually the loser in the Greek wrestling contest had his eyes gouged out with resulting blindness for the rest of his days can you imagine the Ephesian church now when they read this epistle from Paul to them with that culture meant a lot more than it does to us and our Western culture but you imagine how it must have gripped their hearts and they said oh my God help me help me if he knocks me down lord don't let me stay or have you ever been knocked down brother Donnie I sure have I've been knocked down many a time but I ain't going to stay there I'm not going to stay there and let him put his hand on my never I'm not gonna stay there and let him win until he takes his fingers and poke out my eyes and I don't know what's right and I don't know what's wrong I don't know what's today and I don't know what's nice if I fall let me Rise Again If I Stumble let me rise again [Applause] Hallelujah somehow Satan has moved into a place and this age of godship not just a prince but the god of this world second Corinthians 4 3 but if our gospel be hit his head to them that are lost listen carefully now in whom the God of this world has blinded the minds of them which believe not lest the lie to the Glorious gospel of Christ who is the image of God should shine unto them so look what Satan does to secure their obedience my grandfather my mother's father was blind every time I go visit him and my grandmother always felt so sorry for him and being just a little bitty guy you know I'd walk in I'd look at him I'd speak to him he'd say hello Donnie a kind of a Gruff voice he was very very sensitive to hearing you know people without them senses sometimes are and he'd be very very sensitive so I didn't feel comfortable playing I didn't feel comfortable in moving about because his hearing was so acute so I'd go in and just kind of sit there and my grandma and Papaw as I call them they used to listen they didn't have television thank the Lord but they used to listen to uh malls singing convention I see some of you are not in your heads and some of you are looking at me like I'm from another planet you don't want to be talking about do you anybody know what my old singing can be said Lord have mercy whatever's gospel singing and they'd come on every night and that listened to it and he would not want me moving I'd look at him I look at him every time every time I look at my hands like this it reminds me of him because my hands are almost identical replicas of his hands the way my thumb projects out in the little concave there so every time I look at myself and I spread my hands this way I can still remember taking my fingers and I'd look up his eyes of course he couldn't see me I always thought how pitiful it was he couldn't see the trees couldn't see the flowers I guess one thing that hurt me the most was he never saw me all my whole life he was blind so he never saw me and I think about people one statement in order to keep them so my grandfather was totally dependent on others to lead him around he couldn't go hardly from one room to another sure he had a cane and he'd go around but he'd get turned around not knowing which way he was don't you understand why the darkness and the last day is prophesied to be so bad why because the sins of the nation our nation has rejected God and the prophet said he didn't pray for him years ago what about tonight and we look all around us and the land we know were the last plagues to strike egyptus what deaths and the prophet says the last plague to strike the Pentecostal Church his spiritual deaths and they don't know what's right or wrong anymore everything is great well I don't know what's right what's wrong who's right who's wrong where do we go what do we do it's pitiful and when the message out of the same way they hear this preacher preach them they follow that they hear this preacher preach they follow that what is it oh God it seems like somebody can no longer find out what's right or wrong which way do we go what do we do ah so he blinds them and that way they'll never be able to see the precious rays of the sunlight of God There's A Better Way really which way is that you don't have to live this way really I don't so he blinds them so all they see is this this world that they're in do you understand even those that are not elected nordained to life if they ever saw the mercy of God many of them whosoever will that come by the multitudes but Satan blinds them keeps them in this prison I'll tell you one thing we ought to be the happiest people on the face of the Earth an evil Wicked ruler that puts out the eyes of his people before they can catch the splendor of this Mighty Prince in his glory takes away the reasoning of their soul blinds them into this utter Darkness you see us Eve gave him entrance into the human race so his church has given him entrance into godship now please don't misunderstand me our lord Jesus to this very day has never yet been crowned no it's not he is high priest is that right you see the Rapture is him stepping aside from the office of high priest to become fully the Crown King and who will crown him his bride will so who has given Satan this position in the earth and the last day his wife his wife is crowning him King you remember the Song of Solomon whatever he was given a crown and he says he was given this Crown by his mother it was his mother of course Bathsheba which had given him the crown of his nuptials you remember there of course in speaking about Bathsheba that she began to speak prophecy have you ever noticed it or not but Solomon when he wrote about her he said that she had prophesied or gave him some great words and if you look at it she warned him of the very thing that was going to cause his Falling Away remember the prophet tells us that there were seven Church agents in the Old Testament and seven in the new and Solomon was the Ephesian age the building of the house of God and yet Bathsheba began to warn him quite an amazing thing for a woman who walked into the pages of the scripture and the first time we see her she's beckoned into the palace under an act of adultery and yet God transformed This Woman's life and made her to her amen she not only married a king a man who was after God's heart but she became a woman after God's Own Heart I don't know if you under know it or not but proverbs 31 the one that we quote so much of who can find a virtuous woman it is written in the history books and the rabbis and so on say that proverbs 31 was written after and an epitome he paid to the life and the influence of Bathsheba a woman that we will look out that there'd be no hope and no mercy a woman that seemingly wouldn't pass the bounds of Grace but yet when you look and see what God done and take a woman in that type of a scenario and then God turns her life around and said who can find a virtuous woman her price is far and above rubies maybe some of you were women that were wrong and men that were wrong and the Devil Himself had gave up all hope on you but the Lord Jesus got a hold of you and he called your name and he raised you her and he justified you and he Sanctified you and he filled you with the Holy Ghost and tonight you said here as part of the bride of Christ a bride that is far above rubies a bride that is worse more than all this world [Applause] now let me get to my title it's time to close let's not appreciate about a marvelous success so now I don't want to title this from a success to a complete failure Ezekiel 28 14. Thou Art the anointed cherub that cover us look at the Hebrew word there to hedge fence about shut in scream stop the approach Thou Art they anointed cherub that covereth and I have set thee so so oh my thou lust upon the holy mountain of God thou has walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire listen to this now what's the prophet as it goes into this our bodies were on the earth before there was any life we're made of 16 different elements of the earth as pot as calcium petroleum Cosmic light and so forth held together by Adams 16 elements of the earth and if that is so with scientifically so then our bodies were laying spread out on this Earth before there was any type of life on the earth so Footprints means possession so our bodies were laying on the earth the substance to make them now not our complete body of course you know like it is now but the substance to make our bodies was laying on the Earth again he says calcium petroleum Cosmic light was up at the creation as the volcanic was thrown out they tell us the Earth and so forth it was just burning Brimstone I remember from the soul of the Earth oh I can hear him saying question answers on Genesis 1953 let us all step up to the banister and let's see this story and then I I can see this so father God speaks the logos let there be light and there was light I can see a clinker as it comes off the sun and it drops drops drops drops this sort of white light goes over it and he stops it then another one comes what is it he said he's riding his first Bible so he said the Earth come out of the sun oh and I'm sure you know it that if you go into the soul you dig past the surface of the Earth and past the core and you go into the very heart of the earth and what do you find where it came from you find the core of the earth is identical to the Sun wow but you got to get past all the rock and all the mud and all the dirt and well if you take a good look at yourself you'll find you're the same way you get past all your faults and all your Reagan and all your Watkins and all your Smith and all this and that and the other and what will you find down inside of there you'll find a soul that come from God so if we look deep enough what do we see in the earth we see not just where the Earth is going but where the Earth come from Hallelujah so the core of Earth remember the Earth has been through these changes over and over again but she has this promise you know that the Bible oh I love this the Bible has the Earth's name written in the Book of Life you ever notice the Bible don't call Jupiters by name Uranus Saturn Mars Pluto they said why don't God just get rid of the earth he can't her name is written in the Book of Life and notice what God designated the Earth's ass a female her she her she she is one of God's actually why God doesn't got rid of me he can't why God doesn't got rid of you I've caused him a lot of trouble I've caused him a lot of difficulty why can't God get rid of you because you're one of his attributes hallelujah hallelujah that's one reason Satan hates you so now watch the Earth is spilling out of her soil out of her soul rather there was no lows Home Depot and God needed building material to start on the Earth so God just from the soul of the Earth had the Earth ago and the earth started belching out on the volcano calcium laying over here potash petroleum Cosmic light copper phosphate 10. all these things what's God doing making his lumber yard pre-home Depot days now remember the devil and his angels had done fail you'll imagine now as they step brother into wherever it is they're out there in the universe we don't know exactly wherever they was in the universe and they watched God as they start expanding his creation I just read it day before yesterday that right now in the known universe what they've been able to see they estimate there are 20 22 septillion Stars anybody know what septillion means 24 zeros and what was that problem you had that was so big oh Hallelujah but Satan saw God and he said all the rest of these stories he thought why is he taking particular ah we better look at this I never seen them do that on all the rest of them do you know that in What's called the elliptical plane where we are placed in the milky white Galaxy that the Stars being visible the Zodiac oh you say oh Lord have mercy brother darling don't tell me you're going there you read the book of Job do you know that God quoted to job the Bible that job read and what was that Bible the Stars God quoted and used the word Pleiades which is the Seven Sisters God quoted Arcturus is that right well don't sit there and look at me funny because that was the Bible that job read and God quoted the Bible that job understood and God put it right there but God showed a special affection and a special love many years ago when our scientists went out and they got so far in their spacecraft and they turned the great big machine back around and when they did they saw what this tiny blue Dot dot Amazing Grace when you imagine when Satan looked they said oh it's mine I want that that the only place as far as we know were the hydrogen the oxygen the water the atmosphere is just right for life if we were just a few thousand light years closer to the CERN we'd be burnt up if it was very much farther out would be so cold and frigid we could never have life but whoever it was that put us here put us here for a purpose do you understand that where we are whenever the spaceships go out and look back and they start looking at the constellations they don't even recognize nothing that we see from here it's like whoever put us here wrote this story up here but you got to be right here to look up and read it oh Oh Glory to God God wanted a bride reads the word and to her it makes perfect sense others look at it and say I don't know what it means you got to be at the right place you got to be at the right elliptical plane in order to look back that's why God sent us a prophet you remember when they sent Hubble out there several years ago and Hubble was kind of cross-eyed you remember that show they had to make some lenses like glasses and send it out there and put on Hubble and once they did then Hubble got all straightened up oh that's sort of the way we was was reading in the Bible in this cross side was reading about election and we can turn it like this and look at it like him it turned upside down said well I don't know I said one God I say two or the three so God sent us a pair of Malachi four glasses amen he said all right brother I'd slip these on oh well I see now they ate three but they are one they are one they're three manifestations of the same God [Applause] [Music] oh it was burning brimstone it was Satan's possession as he walked up and down the fiery brimstone of the Earth so when it's going through this volcanic stage it's blowing and blowing and blowing and Satan's in there walking all over and said I like it I like it I want it I can tell he's showing special favor to this one and anything he loves I want no friends no that's for sure it's not because we're so special it's because of the special grace of God we're no better than the rest of humanity out here we don't know better than your family your sisters your mothers your brothers some of you may be sitting here tonight and not another member of your family believes the word of the hour God smiled upon you and gave you Grace well I must have prayed more I must have fasted more it ain't nothing one would want one good thing not one Superior thing that you could do it was the grace of God and the pattern fell right on you before the foundation of the world oh let me find a place to close notice this in that day on Calvary for Satan happiers Satan had the Earth of furry rocks that he walked up and down on the Earth's burning brimstones Lucifer was the son of the morning so when the sun before the natural sun rose on the Earth the Sun of the morning Lucifer was walking on the earth and Volcanic stage he's breaking forth the day haha wow those same rocks that had cooled off when Jesus died at Calvary belch's Force out of the Earth wow so the devil had made Footprints apparently on some of them rocks and they'd been buried in time and Jesus said I'm going to show who owns this place now so he began to shake the arrow like a good Holy Ghost meat well Glory Glory Glory somebody touched me I'll record it and then Ross go to shape well come on so don't sit down and look at me like a bunch of dead stone them rocks go to shaken so in Jesus all mine when he died and the Rocks got to shake and it got to moving around I'll never forget it years and years ago I've taken my girls and we went down to a place called Sweetwater Tennessee anybody know where that is Sweetwater Tennessee that Hidden Lake down there saying anybody ever seen that that Lost Sea we got down in there and one of them glass bottom boats and floating around you know oh my wife don't like them type of things at all but we got down in there looking around that guy was telling us they said well these rocks are so many millions of years old and this and that doesn't happen to him but he said right here it's the most recent rockfall that we've been able to find to this day and it happened about two thousand years ago laughs [Laughter] Oh Glory to God I said amen he looked at me really funny he didn't know what I knew but I knew exactly I thought I know exactly what was going on I began to look around for the devil's footprint because I thought it must be somewhere it must be in your somewhere well he had his footprint all over me and he had it all over you and the Holy Ghost got a hold to me and got to hold to you and broke that hole to the devil on our lives and said he don't belong to you no more he belongs to me she is mine [Applause] can I have a few more minutes Ezekiel 28 15. listen to this thou washed perfect hole entire wholesome unimpaired innocent having integrity wow what is complete entirely in a court with truth and fact now this is describing Lucifer before he become the devil perfect whole he was in fact he was right and tied in with truths in fact it's hard to imagine that that become what we know today is the devil isn't it so he was a perfect created being as a matter of fact he was the crowning achievement of God's Great Angelic Realm Angelic Realm perfect sinless but listen at verse 16. by the multitude of thy merchandise they have failed the midst of thee with violence and thou has sinned therefore I will cast thee as profane out of the Mountain of God that he was successful but he will lose had a famous trial here in your country y'all know about it now a great Dynasty I guess we'd say of a family that goes back for many many years and yeah had all this wealth and this power and this and that and the other wind up in prison no telling what crime has been committed by people in such power that is nothing compared to this but this is what God Said I will I will destroy thee now that may not make you happy but that makes me feel like Shout look at this word destroy perish vanish be destroyed be exterminated do away with I will destroy the old covering cherub from the midst of the stones of fire thine heart was lifted up because of thy Beauty

got sanctuaries kodesh sacred place holy place thou has defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities by the iniquity of thy traffic brother Kenny I found this to be one of the most interesting words as I was looking at this today the Hebrew words are used for traffic I just thought is that true can that be true but what it was the traffic was him slandering God he was slandering God to his angels and eventually talk them out of their position so he was trafficking slander he was trafficking all these you know accusations against God Lord have mercy children can you imagine

the devil was invited so God got to testify and he said I just ought to testify today I want to testify about my servant I know job the devil's taking notes of course I've got a man down there that loves me with all his heart he's a perfect man he excuse evil he don't do this and do that and the other well God's holding that big testimony meeting about job I mean it's awesome when we have testimony meetings this is really awesome when God has them but of course Joe didn't hear all that and the devil said well of course he's your pet baby him around you keep him from sickness keep him from trouble sure ain't nobody can serve you like that poor old job he's down here just minding his own business don't take care of his cattles and his camels and all that sort of thing job didn't know he was the subject of a great testimony meeting in heaven I wonder sometimes friend if you and I have not been the subject of God Sam said I lost test five day I've got a daughter her name is Erica Parker she's a mother of two sets of twin girls she's been a good little girl she gave her heart to me when she's this young preachers girl she's mean or the snake before she got saved boy she's a good one she got to say you like to testify she'll serve me even if I allow neuroendocrine tumor to get inside of her body by the time the doctors find it it'll be stage four and one of metastasized and to this very day the doctor still don't know where it even started this is only the baby that they're dealing with they call it because they still don't know where the mother is well I don't know what the mother is and I ain't ridiculate that much concerned about the baby what I'll know is I know who our father is and God said her daddy is my servant it'll break his heart his wife my daughter her sister is my daughter her husband her two daughters it will affect people around the world they'll cry they'll pray for her and I'm going to testify for whatever happens when it's all said and done that'll all be stronger and they'll love me even more than they do now I imagine the Lord must have had a similar testimony meeting not too often long ago and he said I've got a daughter down there her name is Debbie Debbie Watkins or she loves me her husband's my servant but I'm gonna allow her to go through something like she ain't never been through before she'll go to doctors and they'll do tests and they'll do this and that and the other but I want to testify for whatever happens she's going to come out on the other side stronger than she's ever been before oh Lord God is that what you want God to be able to say about you wouldn't it be awful if God had to say about us in heaven I can't let nothing come on them they're such a baby they're so spoiled I've got to keep them in a glass of bubble uh if they don't go to church in two or three services and don't feel me and write them down the house I think ain't even been to church I don't want God to say that about me I ain't standing in line for trials I'm the first one to tell you that tonight but if he and his wisdom sends them my way I know he'll bring me through them I don't always know the outcome I don't know how they'll end up but I know no matter how they end up he'll have his way in my life Hallelujah Hallelujah and when it's all said and done this is why I want you to find my position [Music] and

of the devil out of your life you know I was thinking to myself that Donnie was talking about there at the very end and my goodness how Dreadful it would be I thought to myself if I was standing here and I was such a person that that all God ever got out of me was just a belly aching and complaining and and he had no confidence in me and he had to constantly pump me up and constantly pump me up and constantly give me another you know another another meeting another meeting another and and and and and no no virtue no strength to to be an overcomer to press through trials I just thought you know I want my heavenly father to be proud of me and there's nothing wrong in that you know I I my dad was that way and you know brother Eddie was not one to hide his pride in his children and I can remember so many times that you know he would just he was look at me and he was so proud and that smile I can still see it in my mind's eye he never held back praise he never held back his pride he always always rewarded a job well done you know listen friends I don't have a clue I I can't account for how you came into the world or what your dad did or didn't do but I'm here to tell you there's a heavenly father who can be proud of you a Heavenly Father you say I want him to be proud of me tonight and he'll smile right down on your life right where you stand tonight now how many want that kind of heavenly father oh my I thought about how that the how that Lucifer brother only made that statement I think he was reading from that quote there Lucifer betrayed Michael he betrayed betrayal is a terrible thing because you had such confidence and you had such friendship and you had trust and you put yourself on the line and you you went you went you you pulled your weight and you got betrayed and I thought to myself I wonder if there are people in here tonight who've been betrayed by Lucifer the same way fancy lie eyes about what he would do for you and you'd have more friends and you'd have this this life and that life and this would be better for you and this would be better maybe maybe in a marriage somewhere in here tonight he made you some false promise and now he he's betrayed you and you say I I've been betrayed all the all the promise that he made me is nothing but lies and my life is broken oh my I'm gonna tell you something friends I thought about how that how that you know we're not to be like Eve because he he betrayed Eve the same way and I thought this to myself I thought I wonder if in this building tonight if there's anybody who can relate and say you know I thought I wonder if there's anybody in this building tonight that Lucifer maybe is just in the last stages of betrayal and he's got you on a string and you sit in this building tonight and you've heard the word and you've heard enough word that you ought to have gone free from every influence of the devil I'm here to tell you he's a liar and he's a betrayer and he does he does nothing his only motive is to destroy and to kill and I thought to myself you know Satan he he loves everything that God makes beautiful and he loves to ruin it I want to tell you something you young men you young women and the beauty of Life Satan desires that you hear that teenagers you you you say oh I'm doing fine don't don't imagine that he's not lurking that betrayer is looking to take that beauty and it won't even take him very long and he'll steal it from you and he'll steal your joy and he'll steal your happiness and he'll steal your life if you let him I say we don't let him I say we call down the power of God this the word has exposed this betrayer he's not your friend he betrayed Michael he betrayed Eve he's betraying people he's trying to betray people tonight I just say not me not me I'm not falling for that Hallelujah I got a father who loves me and I want that father to be proud of me I want to have this same word bring me to the same kind of Liberty that the great Saints all down through the Bible Faith Saints I call them how many want that tonight oh why don't you bow your heads and raise your hand and let's pray a prayer all across this building father in the name of Jesus this great betrayer Lord who betrayed Michael in the beginning who betrayed Eve in the he's betrayed uh tried to betray your family all down through Jesus himself was betrayed oh God by those who are supposed to care for him and love him father I pray tonight that whoever might be under the sound of my voice in this building out of this building and Satan maybe just has them in the he's just set the Trap he's in the last stages they don't know it yet they think they're fine and they don't know he's just one or two more moves on the chessboard and he'll have them oh Lamb of God send forth your word tonight let there be Faith across this building Let There Be Faith across these young people these older people married people single people Lord let there be Liberty in this place
