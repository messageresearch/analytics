[33:40] Lord now I'm going to just pick up these
[33:45] uh next two slides we got this one the
[33:47] next one and a part of the third one um
[33:52] on last Sunday and so I want to come
[33:55] back here to this again
[33:57] and let's let's pick up our reading
[34:00] straight away uh in this message Christ
[34:03] is the mystery of God revealed so I want
[34:07] you now and here here's a real point
[34:09] that I that I I I feel it on my heart I
[34:13] brother Jason was preaching uh on our
[34:16] midweek service before Thanksgiving and
[34:20] I was so Smitten by that sermon and one
[34:23] of the points that I just thought was
[34:26] profound
[34:27] was how that brother JD took that woman
[34:31] at the well and he showed how that you
[34:34] know she began and brother Brandon picks
[34:36] it up she Begins the conversation Jesus
[34:39] starts itoman bring me a drink she
[34:42] replies you know blah blah blah blah
[34:44] blah he replies back she replies back
[34:47] and then you know the the the
[34:49] conversation stays natural stays
[34:52] political you know you know here you
[34:54] know if you you know what are you doing
[34:56] ask asking me you know we're not of the
[34:58] same political persuasion and uh you
[35:01] know you you're you're you got a
[35:03] different ideology about God than us and
[35:06] you say in Jerusalem and we say here and
[35:08] you know and this well you know was dug
[35:10] by our fathers and are you greater than
[35:13] our fathers and the conversation just
[35:15] starts moving into spiritual Realms and
[35:19] and then he he says butom if you if you
[35:22] knew who you were talking to you would
[35:25] actually ask me for a drink and and if
[35:28] you knew who you were talking to all
[35:30] your political prohibitions would
[35:33] collapse all of your Social walls would
[35:36] come down all of your personality and
[35:39] your complexes if you only knew who you
[35:43] were talking to and you know friends I I
[35:46] I was so caught by that I I I hope that
[35:50] today when you come here into the house
[35:53] of God you realize who it is you're
[35:55] coming to hear from from you're not just
[35:57] coming to hear from a man uh you're
[36:00] coming to hear from the word of God and
[36:03] it's a word that's been not only
[36:05] revealed doctrinally but made alive uh
[36:09] in a people amen so that it's a living
[36:12] manifestation that that is one of the
[36:15] foremost realities of the word of God
[36:19] now listen to this statement I've made
[36:22] it
[36:23] before remember this is is the third
[36:28] iteration of God's
[36:31] word the very first one was in the Stars
[36:34] before this one was ever put together
[36:36] the second one was in the Pyramid of
[36:38] Enoch before this one was ever put
[36:41] together then the third one has been
[36:44] this one amen God never intended for it
[36:47] to stay in the Stars it was to come to
[36:49] the pyramid he never intended for it to
[36:52] stay in the pyramid he intended to put
[36:54] it in a book he never intended for for
[36:56] it to stay in a book it's moving to
[36:59] flesh and that's the purpose of the word
[37:03] that's why you're a Believer that's why
[37:05] you're here hear me is so that this word
[37:09] can become alive in you Jesus was not a
[37:14] Bible Jesus didn't even carry a Bible
[37:18] Jesus was a human version of the word
[37:21] and that's what the Holy Ghost is given
[37:24] for is to take the word that's been
[37:27] opened in our day and transform words on
[37:31] page and put it behind
[37:34] skin it's exactly why when brother
[37:38] brandham took the in the in the dream
[37:41] there of Junior Jackson and he took a
[37:43] crowbar and PRI the top of that mountain
[37:45] brother brandham had been standing there
[37:48] ex you know uh standing there at the
[37:51] mountain and he was explaining the
[37:53] writing on the outside see he he's
[37:57] teaching and and correlating the church
[37:59] ages and tying it all together but then
[38:02] he said I took something out of the air
[38:04] and pride the top off of and when he
[38:07] said when I looked it was white stone
[38:10] that had no writing in
[38:12] it but remember that in White Stone in
[38:15] the Book of Revelation there's a new
[38:17] name amen amen and so then we realize
[38:21] that when brother Brandon would say the
[38:24] word interpreted is a manifestation of
[38:28] the name of God now how does God
[38:30] interpret his word he brings it to pass
[38:33] amen so of course there wouldn't be any
[38:37] writing on the White Stone because it
[38:39] wasn't going to be this kind of writing
[38:42] it was going to be written behind skin
[38:45] the word interpreted would be a
[38:47] manifestation in our
[38:50] lives
[38:53] amen and so the second thing that
[38:57] brother JD it so so just gripped my
[39:00] heart and I thought about our our our
[39:03] senior
[39:04] youth I thought about our teenagers and
[39:08] and all the way down into the younger
[39:10] parts of the senior Youth and all the
[39:11] way up into the 20s somethings and you
[39:14] know I I I I felt such a a burden on my
[39:18] heart to to say to our senior youth you
[39:22] realize that like the woman at the
[39:25] well Jesus kept taking her forward in
[39:29] her understanding that was the real
[39:30] point being made that you know there
[39:33] there's a dialogue and there's a an
[39:35] exchange back and forth and every time
[39:38] she took the next step Jesus gave her a
[39:41] little more understanding and then she
[39:43] responded he gave her some more
[39:45] understanding until he finally got to
[39:46] the point where her understanding
[39:49] reached a thing where all of her sins of
[39:51] her life and all of her problems and all
[39:53] of her weaknesses fell aside her past
[39:57] was erased and she and she be and she
[40:00] now comes under a revelation of the word
[40:02] of God and all her sins are
[40:05] forgiven all her position she had been
[40:08] taken from the uttermost to the
[40:11] uttermost what had happened to her her
[40:13] Revelation had restored her to the
[40:16] position that God had seen of her before
[40:20] the foundation of the
[40:21] world and so the the the point of the of
[40:24] the message comes to take you forward as
[40:28] brother Jason said here he said like the
[40:31] woman you know we have to move forward
[40:33] in our understanding he quoted the
[40:35] scripture that the Holy Ghost Jesus said
[40:38] when he comes he'll lead
[40:42] you he's taking you
[40:44] somewhere he's not just coming into this
[40:47] building on a Sunday morning and just
[40:49] sitting down to chill out with
[40:51] you he's here to lead you somewhere
[40:55] you're supposed to leave here further
[40:57] than you were when you came here so you
[41:01] you don't just remember brother Jason
[41:02] said we're not just to stay without
[41:06] understanding you're to move forward in
[41:10] your understanding not just doctrines
[41:13] but in in the reality of the word living
[41:16] behind you your
[41:18] skin so it begs the question then I
[41:21] would ask the senior youth how many
[41:24] messages of God's prop
[41:26] Have you listened to in the last 30 days
[41:30] amen how many complete start to finish
[41:34] messages you know
[41:36] what I I should you know what I should
[41:39] be able to to to know about you you want
[41:42] you just want some advice from Brother
[41:43] Jason your your answer should be 20-some
[41:47] at
[41:48] least a tape a day will'll keep the
[41:51] devil
[41:54] away that's a bonf IED fact I have
[41:58] proven
[41:59] it you know it'll keep the devil away
[42:02] it'll put strength in your life it'll
[42:05] tell you who you are it'll tell you who
[42:07] the enemy is and how to beat him and I
[42:09] want to beat him and I want to see you
[42:12] beating I want to see Us
[42:15] Victorious see so you know make it make
[42:19] it a don't you know say well I I read
[42:22] some scriptures but the message of the
[42:24] hour came to give you understanding of
[42:26] the
[42:27] scriptures you're never going to have
[42:30] the overcoming power because you know
[42:34] without the message if you say you say
[42:36] well I but I've got my Bible Well that
[42:38] like brother Jason said you come to
[42:41] church and people think that real
[42:43] worship is just singing songs and
[42:45] raising our hands but brother brother JD
[42:48] points out everybody does
[42:51] that everybody goes to church and does
[42:53] that what what what is that that that
[42:55] hasn't had any real effect in their
[42:57] lives it's a nice momentary Sensational
[43:01] feeling but where's the real mileage
[43:04] that it gets where does it gain Traction
[43:06] in their lives and bring them forward do
[43:08] you realize that the devil has watered
[43:10] down he the devil has attacked every
[43:14] point of the
[43:18] restoration he attacked it once the
[43:20] apostles were gone
[43:22] off and of course the seed had to go
[43:25] into the ground we know that serve God's
[43:27] purpose just like the fall in the Garden
[43:29] of Eden had to happen serves God's
[43:33] purpose but God promised in Joel I will
[43:36] restore the years am everything that the
[43:40] enemy took from God's church it was
[43:42] going to be
[43:43] restored and so the devil started
[43:47] immediately let me just give you a
[43:48] little bit of Education the devil
[43:50] started immediately attacking the
[43:53] restored word yeah amen he started
[43:56] immediately attacking Luther's
[43:59] Revelation the just shall live by faith
[44:02] and and so he you know what what did
[44:04] that do well it it kind of taught people
[44:06] that they you know the devil he he he
[44:09] Luther was actually what what Luther was
[44:12] bringing would bring a new
[44:14] birth but when the Devil by the time the
[44:16] devil got done with
[44:18] it and all he had just got the people in
[44:21] their minds to where well I don't have
[44:23] to listen to Rome anymore
[44:27] I don't have to do pennants and carry
[44:29] rosary beads and pray to
[44:32] Mary that and and and by by the time you
[44:35] get to and I don't have to do the I
[44:38] don't have to lash myself and crawl on
[44:40] glass and I don't have to do all those
[44:41] things the just shall live by faith and
[44:44] by the time you get to to today the
[44:47] attack on Luther's message is just
[44:50] telling the people that all you have to
[44:51] do is just have a mental agreement with
[44:54] an an event 20 years
[44:57] ago of of the Lamb of God dying on the
[45:01] on the cross the Lamb of God did die on
[45:02] the cross but what and he did he did say
[45:05] and he rose what good does that do you
[45:08] if you don't receive his life that
[45:10] doesn't do you any good that's great for
[45:13] him that he rose but what about
[45:15] you have you risen with him I promise
[45:18] you you don't rise with him unless you
[45:19] die with
[45:23] him and then and then starts and so
[45:27] today it's just a watered down version
[45:29] of just make a
[45:30] decision and it's not much more of a
[45:33] decision than it's actually less of a
[45:35] decision than which car to
[45:37] buy cuz people actually have a
[45:41] preference on which vehicle they buy but
[45:44] there's no impact on their life and that
[45:46] and the impact of their preference
[45:48] causes them to go out and purchase the
[45:49] vehicle they want people look at the
[45:51] gospel and there's no impact on their
[45:53] life
[45:54] whatever the they just make a decision
[45:57] and start coming to a
[45:58] church put their name on a book and
[46:01] believe that they're I know that's hard
[46:03] for you to get your mind around because
[46:04] you're taught different and you've been
[46:05] raised different but trust me as one
[46:08] who's worked out there in the community
[46:11] and and moved all my life among
[46:14] people you would be astonished at what
[46:17] at the people who live the the most
[46:20] degraded lifestyle have the most potty
[46:24] mouth you ever imagine think and do the
[46:26] most outrageous horrible things and will
[46:29] look you in the eye with perfect
[46:31] confidence and sayoh I know I'm born
[46:33] again I know I'll be in heaven yeah well
[46:35] how why do you think that well because I
[46:37] I accept that Jesus Christ died on the
[46:40] cross for
[46:41] me okay that's good have you died with
[46:43] him what does that
[46:44] mean I joined a church well that's not
[46:46] what I asked you have you died with
[46:49] him and then you then Satan wasn't done
[46:53] attacking the the you see see what
[46:56] here's what they lose sight of is that
[46:59] Luther's
[47:00] Revelation came from above it was a
[47:05] supernatural thing that God partially
[47:08] opened a third seal under the man age
[47:10] and dropped a mystery down under a
[47:12] partially open third seal and a and a
[47:15] messenger caught it and ran with it and
[47:17] it was a message that would bring
[47:19] eternal
[47:21] life and that's the part they're
[47:24] missing then they started attacking
[47:28] sanctification and immediately began
[47:30] watering it down and you know today you
[47:33] know I mean my goodness by the time you
[47:34] reach today what what what is commonly
[47:38] called Christianity it's certainly in
[47:40] the western world is is is allow to use
[47:44] the Bible language their tables are full
[47:46] of vomit yeah amen and that's not a far
[47:50] stretch you can see it when you look at
[47:53] what they call Christianity it makes me
[47:55] feel feel like
[47:56] vomiting it is so vulgar and so
[47:59] ridiculous and so not have do you
[48:02] realize friends do you realize and I
[48:04] could take my my time today and I'm I'm
[48:06] completely off my subject it's just a
[48:08] fresh anointing on me do you realize
[48:11] that that that that
[48:15] sanctification in the Bible Sanctified
[48:19] lifestyle Holiness am do you realize and
[48:23] I could prove it to you today listen to
[48:26] me Holiness is second only to the in the
[48:29] Bible is second only that to that Jesus
[48:32] is the Lamb of
[48:35] God I could take you to scripture after
[48:38] scripture after scripture Old Testament
[48:41] in the gospels in the New Testament
[48:43] throughout the Book of Revelation
[48:45] Holiness unto the Lord I is is not just
[48:49] some lifestyle of dos and don'ts but
[48:51] you'll never make it that way it's a
[48:53] living experience that you you have and
[48:56] then the there's a living Force takes
[48:58] over your mind and you don't do the way
[49:01] things of the world you don't dress like
[49:02] the world you don't act like the world
[49:04] you don't talk like the world there's an
[49:06] alien force has taken over
[49:10] you I mean as a subject it's it's I
[49:13] would say off the top of my head
[49:16] sanctification and Holiness before God
[49:20] is second I would say the only thing I
[49:22] could even think of that would outpace
[49:24] it would be that Christ was the Lamb of
[49:26] God slain before the foundation of the
[49:29] world and came to save
[49:31] Sinners that Christ is the Lamb of God
[49:33] and is the Messiah and his God would
[49:35] probably be the only thing that would
[49:37] outpace
[49:38] it
[49:40] [Applause]
[49:41] amen so so you just remember that
[49:48] that that God you know has this for you
[49:51] I'm sorry I'm I can't escape it
[49:56] I don't know
[50:00] why listen to this I don't know why I'm
[50:02] caging on this
[50:04] today let me just give you a
[50:08] few you say why make such a big deal
[50:11] over this because it's such a big
[50:14] problem amen even in the ranks of the
[50:17] message of the hour
[50:19] amen Jesus says blessed are the pure in
[50:24] heart
[50:26] for they shall see
[50:28] God those who are pure in their heart
[50:32] you're not going to tell me your your
[50:34] inside is pure if your outside is
[50:39] obscene you're not going to tell me your
[50:41] inside heart is pure if the clothing you
[50:44] wear are is vulgar and your conversation
[50:48] is is not
[50:53] wholesome Paul said
[50:56] having therefore in 2 Corinthians 7:1
[50:59] having therefore these promises dearly
[51:01] beloved let us cleanse
[51:04] ourselves from all filthiness of the
[51:07] Flesh and spirit perfecting Holiness in
[51:12] the fear of God Amen he says to the
[51:15] Roman Church in chapter 6 verse 22 but
[51:18] now being made free from sin and become
[51:21] servants to God ye have your fruit unto
[51:26] Holiness and the end everlasting life so
[51:31] I mean and I could go on and on and on I
[51:34] Holiness literally Holiness is one of
[51:36] the most established truths in the Bible
[51:40] after Jesus being the Lamb of God
[51:45] Amen then they attack the baptism of the
[51:49] Holy Ghost and we've been having we've
[51:50] had a lot of teaching on that recently
[51:53] trying to teach bethl Tabernacle the
[51:56] balance of it myself and the other team
[51:59] me Members Ministry team members to show
[52:02] you that we're not looking to I don't I
[52:05] don't drive in
[52:06] ditches I drive on the road I'm not
[52:09] interested in either
[52:11] ditch it doesn't even matter if I can I
[52:14] got a four-wheel drive truck I could I
[52:16] don't want to I want to drive in the
[52:18] middle of the road I wanted something
[52:20] smooth I want to be on a Highway to
[52:24] Heaven
[52:26] see so so it's we we're not chasing and
[52:29] and Satan has attacked that and he's
[52:31] trying because if let me tell you
[52:33] something friends if Satan can't hold
[52:35] you back and he tries hard to hold you
[52:37] back and you're going forward in the
[52:39] Lord and he can't hold you back you know
[52:41] what he'll do as a last itch effort
[52:43] he'll shove you over the
[52:44] cliff if he can't hold you he'll just
[52:46] give you a shove and you'll become a
[52:48] fanatic and go off the on the deep
[52:50] end it is
[52:52] unnecessary we have the balance of the
[52:55] the word of God we have a living Christ
[52:57] that can get down in your life and teach
[52:59] you how to live a daily life of
[53:01] overcoming and put real power inside

[53:58] take place that will put the Life of
[54:01] Christ in you
[54:03] naturally it'll change your
[54:07] nature Hallelujah you won't have to be a
[54:10] fanatic you'll be a true blue Christian
[54:13] balanced in the word of God marching to
[54:16] Zion moving into higher Heights with
[54:18] Christ
[54:20] daily it'll set up a craving in your
[54:23] heart for the word of God the more you
[54:24] get the more you
[54:29] want so brother
[54:31] brandham this is the this is what our
[54:34] whole series is
[54:35] about it's Christ being
[54:39] revealed so so I I I want the especially
[54:43] the teenagers I want you to
[54:46] absorb what's being
[54:48] said the the old alike everybody absorb
[54:52] what's being said what is the purpose of
[54:55] the Gospel it's Christ being revealed
[54:59] and he is the word and when the word is
[55:02] revealed it expresses itself you get
[55:07] that it expresses itself th this is how
[55:11] I can tell where a person's Revelation
[55:13] level is by their expression of their
[55:15] life get around them listen to the
[55:17] conversation see what they do where they
[55:18] go what what they do how they live you
[55:21] know what happens in their home where
[55:23] are their
[55:24] priorities I can tell pretty quick where
[55:26] somebody's priority of the word is say
[55:30] where where ought it to be it ought to
[55:32] be
[55:33] first it ought to be the center Hub of
[55:36] your life on which everything else is
[55:38] attached to the gospel didn't come let
[55:41] me tell you something Jesus didn't pay
[55:43] such a great price for to be a gospel of
[55:47] convenience it's not about that Jesus
[55:49] isn't this this gospel I'm going to tell
[55:52] you something friends this gospel that
[55:54] you're believing to today is dripping
[55:56] with the blood of Martyrs it's you what
[55:59] what happened in Israel is is terrible
[56:02] and horrible Beyond description but
[56:03] that's been happening to God's elect
[56:05] family down through
[56:07] centuries it is shocking the depravity
[56:11] of what man can do to fellow men amen
[56:14] and history is replete with it my
[56:16] goodness but but but but I'm here to
[56:18] tell you that God comes to change our
[56:21] lives and he's not he's not a god of con
[56:24] venience you don't just fit him
[56:28] in see he's not a fit
[56:31] in he should be the the first brother
[56:33] brandom said don't make him
[56:37] second I can't even get started on my
[56:39] notes what's going on this is the holy
[56:42] spirit all over me brother brandham said
[56:44] don't make him
[56:47] second he doesn't want to be
[56:50] second he wants to be
[56:53] first would you agree with me today and
[56:56] say Lord I want you to be first in my
[57:00] life
[57:02] first everything else should come behind
[57:05] that your career your education your
[57:08] friendships your relationships your
[57:10] money your Recreation everything should
[57:14] come second to that we're almost home
[57:17] friends where the Rapture is
[57:19] soon oh
[57:23] my so he says it's Christ being
[57:28] revealed and he is the word and when the
[57:31] word is revealed it expresses
[57:35] itself that's God's purpose for Jesus
[57:41] Christ was to express
[57:45] himself to take his own laws and live by
[57:48] his laws fulfill his law by Death
[57:57] fulfill his law by death I think I'm on
[58:00] yeah and Christ God died in flesh in
[58:06] order to condemn sin in the flesh thank
[58:10] God because you couldn't save yourself
[58:13] if he hadn't did it you were headed to
[58:15] hell and no way to stop it Oh my he
[58:18] condemned sin in the flesh that he might
[58:22] bring to himself a glorious bride
[58:25] redeemed back that will believe only in
[58:29] the word of God and not swap it like Eve
[58:32] did for intellectual conceptions of man
[58:36] those watered down versions of
[58:37] justification and sanctification and
[58:39] what the real Holy Ghost is don't accept
[58:42] a watered down
[58:44] version Oh My the devil's not afraid of
[58:47] a watered down
[58:51] version that will only believe only in
[58:55] the word of God and not swap it like Eve
[58:57] did for intellectual conceptions of man
[58:58] you see it that's Christ's idea that's
[59:02] God's idea the new birth reveals this
[59:08] amen
[59:09] amen right there is is what Christianity
[59:14] is all
[59:18] about Jesus said here's where we got to
[59:22] last time Jesus said in Mark 16 these
[59:25] signs shall follow them that believe see
[59:28] so in into all the world all right and
[59:32] to every age casting out devils and
[59:35] speaking with tongues and all these
[59:37] great manifestations of
[59:39] gifts that would follow that they shall
[59:42] not they maybe they ought to they
[59:47] will all right
[59:49] so so we find then
[59:53] that that Redemption now I'm I'm going
[59:56] to try to go a little further you still
[59:59] with me I feel like I've already
[1:00:01] preached enough sermon you could go home
[1:00:02] but will you just hang out a while and
[1:00:04] let me carry
[1:00:06] on Redemption was a must we know that
[1:00:10] brother Brenham talks about how that we
[1:00:13] read it in in several parts ago in the
[1:00:16] series I don't want to go that far back
[1:00:18] but how that from Genesis chapter
[1:00:23] 1 his his family was to have
[1:00:30] dominion over everything and brother
[1:00:33] brandham said you know it's it goes all
[1:00:35] the way out to the Millennium and then
[1:00:37] he I didn't show it to you last time not
[1:00:39] going to do it again today but he drops
[1:00:41] right down and picks up 1 Corinthians 12
[1:00:43] and even talks about all the gifts and
[1:00:46] how that we're to have a dominion over
[1:00:47] that stuff we're not we're not to be out
[1:00:50] of balance with it we're to have
[1:00:53] dominion we're to have balance we're to
[1:00:55] have correct understanding you're to
[1:00:58] have dominion in your home listen this
[1:01:01] this goes from the garden all the way to
[1:01:04] the Millennium where it says have
[1:01:06] dominion over the fish of the Sea and
[1:01:08] the fowls of the air and over every
[1:01:09] living thing that creepeth upon the
[1:01:11] Earth so brother R says it goes all the
[1:01:12] way to all the way to the to the to the
[1:01:15] Millennium so Redemption then of course
[1:01:18] is a must and that's always been uh part
[1:01:22] of the Great purpose of God now we've
[1:01:25] shown you how that in the Garden of Eden
[1:01:28] it wasn't time brother brandham said
[1:01:30] they weren't even able to partake of the
[1:01:33] Tree of Life
[1:01:34] directly because it hadn't become flesh
[1:01:37] yet because Redemption had to work out
[1:01:39] you understand there had to be a fall
[1:01:41] and then they couldn't partake of it
[1:01:43] before the fall directly because it
[1:01:45] hadn't been flesh yet and then they
[1:01:47] couldn't partake of it directly after
[1:01:49] the fall because they got chased out you
[1:01:52] understand so so what is so then how do
[1:01:55] we get there oh I'm so glad you asked me
[1:01:58] that how we get there is God comes down
[1:02:01] into this world and brings a revelation
[1:02:04] of his word Bit by Bit by Bit And as you
[1:02:07] eat upon that you're redeemed and you're
[1:02:10] rebuilt oh my that's what our whole
[1:02:12] rebuilding Eden series was all about
[1:02:15] he's rebuilding us back to our original
[1:02:19] image see and so so it had to become
[1:02:24] flesh verse but just know this that from
[1:02:27] Abel's offering
[1:02:29] forward Dominion is
[1:02:32] underway it's being restored full
[1:02:35] Dominion is underway for God's
[1:02:38] family so brother brandom goes on so
[1:02:41] it's
[1:02:42] Christ expressing himself in the
[1:02:47] individual whether he's intellectual or
[1:02:49] whether he don't know his ABCs amen
[1:02:52] doesn't matter right
[1:02:55] he his that that's a that's a completely
[1:02:58] irrelevant point to him some people are
[1:03:01] Highly Educated some people are not as
[1:03:04] as as old Jerry used to say son young
[1:03:08] man I can see that you are educated far
[1:03:12] above and beyond your level of
[1:03:18] intelligence and some people are like
[1:03:20] that I'm just here to tell you it
[1:03:21] doesn't matter to God he's not coming
[1:03:24] here to educate you brother brandom said
[1:03:27] he says it like this Heaven won't have
[1:03:29] any kind of education civilization he
[1:03:31] turns right around and says it'll be an
[1:03:33] education so far above this one this one
[1:03:36] won't even be thought
[1:03:39] of see so it's Christ expressing himself
[1:03:44] in the individual whether he's
[1:03:46] intellectual or whether he don't know
[1:03:47] his ABCs the new
[1:03:50] birth is Christ is a revelation
[1:03:55] God has revealed to you this great
[1:03:59] mystery and that's a new
[1:04:03] birth see so I know I can tell whether
[1:04:07] or not I can tell where your level of
[1:04:09] revelation is by observing whether the
[1:04:13] word is expressing itself through you
[1:04:15] where it should be amen am see and if
[1:04:19] it's not and sadly I find too often that
[1:04:23] it's not in too many cases too many
[1:04:26] cases right here in Beth Tabernacle now
[1:04:28] granted to any real Pastor any real
[1:04:31] Shepherd even One cases too many all
[1:04:34] right so I I don't want you to think
[1:04:35] it's all doom and gloom I appreciate the
[1:04:37] the fervor that I see in the Saints of
[1:04:39] bethl Tabernacle but even one is too
[1:04:42] much for me I want to see us all full of
[1:04:44] the fire of the Holy Spirit I want to
[1:04:47] see you take every Spirit under your
[1:04:49] control for the glory of God I want to
[1:04:52] see a token applied in our homes and our
[1:04:55] young people full of the Holy Spirit I
[1:04:58] want to see when we walk down the street
[1:05:00] Satan hows and faints at our
[1:05:05] presence so so the new birth
[1:05:09] then is more than an a a mental
[1:05:12] understanding and it's more than a a
[1:05:14] mental agreement with doctrinal
[1:05:17] teaching it's a
[1:05:20] lifechanging
[1:05:22] revelation that brings forth the
[1:05:24] expression of
[1:05:26] Christ as we've been
[1:05:28] reading it brings forth the expression
[1:05:31] of Christ from the heart
[1:05:34] out amen from the see lot a lot of the
[1:05:38] reason people can't
[1:05:40] maintain sanctification like they need
[1:05:43] to when they don't have that full
[1:05:46] experience that brings the new birth is
[1:05:48] because that's outside in and you're
[1:05:50] you're trying to you're trying to force
[1:05:52] a a a a legal quot a legal coat a legal
[1:05:57] cloak onto me and make me look right and
[1:06:00] dress right and think right and talk
[1:06:02] right and and do things right but after
[1:06:04] a while this this guy right here gets
[1:06:07] sick of that and he just starts jerking
[1:06:09] it off but and he and he won't wear it
[1:06:12] anymore that we're not after that we're
[1:06:15] after changing the inside
[1:06:18] outward
[1:06:20] Hallelujah then the then the thing that
[1:06:23] that the that wearies you and makes you
[1:06:25] upset is when the flesh doesn't obey the
[1:06:28] word of God there's no weariness Jesus
[1:06:32] said take my yoke upon you for my yoke
[1:06:35] is easy and my burden is light everybody
[1:06:38] who's Born Again of the spirit of God
[1:06:40] Can Say Amen to that it's the greatest
[1:06:43] thing it's every desire of my heart
[1:06:45] there's no trouble in being a Christian
[1:06:47] I only get upset when I fail at being a
[1:06:51] Christian there's no wearing me me out
[1:06:54] long term that eventually someday I'll
[1:06:56] just backslide and go away from it I
[1:06:59] this is from the inside
[1:07:02] out that's right
[1:07:05] see so this is this is the gene of
[1:07:10] God that has come to life and is taking
[1:07:13] over your life the evidence I mean the
[1:07:16] evidence of a
[1:07:18] true and I'm going to read you a
[1:07:20] scripture that I don't have up here but
[1:07:22] I'm just going to read it to you I'm
[1:07:23] actually not read it all but I'm just
[1:07:24] going to make some points to
[1:07:26] it want to say this the
[1:07:29] evidence of
[1:07:31] True Life
[1:07:34] altering
[1:07:36] Revelation if you ever want to see where
[1:07:38] it's laid out
[1:07:40] perfectly in the
[1:07:42] Bible almost like a beautiful garden you
[1:07:45] could go see then just find yourself in
[1:07:49] Acts chapter
[1:07:50] 2 you say oh yeah verse 38 be baptized
[1:07:54] name of but no not 38 go to 41 and read
[1:07:57] through 47 because 41 and 47 is going to
[1:08:01] let you know why they obeyed acts
[1:08:05] 238 why did they do that because they
[1:08:07] heard a gospel preacher preaching and it
[1:08:10] pricked their hearts and they knew that
[1:08:13] in spite of all of their devout Judaism
[1:08:15] and these these were devout men these
[1:08:17] weren't gamblers and carousers these
[1:08:19] were devout Jews who lived holy lives
[1:08:23] before Jehovah but when they heard the
[1:08:26] gospel that I'm preaching
[1:08:28] today when they heard about the Holy
[1:08:30] Ghost that I'm preaching today they they
[1:08:33] knew inside their hearts that they were
[1:08:37] missing that element all they had was an
[1:08:40] outside observance but it caused them to
[1:08:43] taste of the good word of God and they
[1:08:44] wanted more and said Peter what must we
[1:08:47] do and he said you got to repent you got
[1:08:50] to change your whole thinking you got to
[1:08:52] accept the word of this hour and the
[1:08:55] Bible says in verse
[1:08:57] 41-47 then they that gladly received his
[1:09:01] word were
[1:09:04] baptized that's why they obeyed acts
[1:09:07] 238 they did it gladly no one convicted
[1:09:12] them into it that's right no one
[1:09:14] threatened them or scared them into it
[1:09:17] that's worthless no one you know told
[1:09:20] him sad
[1:09:21] stories about how there you know your
[1:09:23] I'm a pray for you and boohoo and get
[1:09:26] them down to an altar and as soon as
[1:09:28] they get away from that they go right
[1:09:30] back there's no there's no effective
[1:09:32] change but but these men had something
[1:09:35] in their hearts and they gladly received
[1:09:38] his word but you know what that tells me
[1:09:41] that tells me that in all of their
[1:09:43] righteous ritual they had no joy they
[1:09:46] had no real joy in the Lord and that's
[1:09:49] what I want and I want it for me and I
[1:09:51] want it for you a joy in the Lord is my
[1:09:57] strength they that gladly received his
[1:10:00] word and then look at what happened in
[1:10:01] verse 42 and they
[1:10:04] continued
[1:10:06] steadfastly in the apostles
[1:10:10] Doctrine so they didn't stop and say
[1:10:14] well I just believe Jesus at
[1:10:16] Calvary I don't I don't Peter James I
[1:10:18] like you guys you're pretty cool but I
[1:10:20] don't really need what you got to say I
[1:10:21] just want Jesus at Calvary
[1:10:24] they con the ones who were born again by
[1:10:27] the spirit and were baptized in his name
[1:10:29] and received the Holy Ghost continued
[1:10:33] steadfastly all the time every day every
[1:10:36] day all the time moving forward moving
[1:10:39] forward move forward church because one
[1:10:42] of these days you're going to be like
[1:10:43] Enoch and move into a new
[1:10:45] world
[1:10:49] hallelujah hallelujah and godly fear
[1:10:52] it's what the Greek word means Godly
[1:10:54] respect and reverence fear Came Upon
[1:10:57] Every
[1:10:58] Soul verse 46 they continued daily with
[1:11:02] one Accord verse 47 praising
[1:11:05] God and the Lord added to the church
[1:11:08] daily such as should be saved as long as
[1:11:11] the Lord was adding it everything stayed
[1:11:14] fine soon as they started soon as the
[1:11:17] church started allowing people to come
[1:11:19] in and call themselves a Christian when
[1:11:21] they weren't really that's when problems
[1:11:24] started
[1:11:27] amen so brother brandham goes on you
[1:11:31] good all right I'm gonna watch my time
[1:11:34] because y'all know how terrible I am at
[1:11:35] keeping the throttle down so I'm just
[1:11:38] going to cut my time to a
[1:11:40] normal
[1:11:43] amen
[1:11:45] now what are you going to
[1:11:48] do when you get all that group together
[1:11:51] what what what what group The One ones
[1:11:53] that are expressing God the ones that
[1:11:56] have the expression of the word see what
[1:11:59] are you going to do when you get all
[1:12:01] that group together where the Revelation
[1:12:04] is perfectly in Harmony and God is
[1:12:08] expressing it through his word by the
[1:12:11] same actions the same things that he did
[1:12:15] making the word manifest oh if the
[1:12:17] church only knew its position it will
[1:12:20] one day then the Rapture will go when it
[1:12:23] knows what it is am
[1:12:27] amen when it knows what it
[1:12:30] is I'm gonna invent a word
[1:12:34] today I tried every possibility in The
[1:12:37] King's English to to conceptualize what
[1:12:41] I want to say to you and I and believe
[1:12:43] it or not I'm I'm having to invent a
[1:12:45] word because I read a bunch of quotes
[1:12:47] from a Kentucky hillbilly and this is as
[1:12:49] close as I can come up
[1:12:52] with I'm I'm I let me let me let me I'm
[1:12:56] gonna I'm GNA take this word
[1:12:58] human you have been
[1:13:01] human if you had never if you were born
[1:13:05] and raised in a bubble and never known
[1:13:06] another person in your life you've never
[1:13:08] been
[1:13:09] human but because we hang around humans
[1:13:12] you're
[1:13:14] human see well then why don't you just
[1:13:16] use the word humanized because that
[1:13:17] would convey the not what I'm trying to
[1:13:19] gonna go to right now I'm just going to
[1:13:24] let brother brandham say it all right so
[1:13:26] you don't have to worry about believing
[1:13:29] me did you notice Paul never knew Jesus
[1:13:34] physically Paul never knew him the only
[1:13:37] way that Paul knew him was by
[1:13:39] Revelation by a vision is that right
[1:13:43] here's your chance is that
[1:13:46] right Paul only knew Jesus by the
[1:13:49] Revelation and then he says just like
[1:13:51] Peter did say wait a minute I thought
[1:13:52] Peter knew him In the Flesh the point
[1:13:55] brother Brandon is going to make is that
[1:13:56] Peter did know him in the flesh but but
[1:13:59] we find that Peter had a real experience
[1:14:01] because knowing him in the flesh he
[1:14:03] denied him in the garden knowing him in
[1:14:05] the flesh he tried to stop him from
[1:14:07] Calvary knowing him in the flesh he
[1:14:09] denied him three times in pilate's
[1:14:11] judgment Hall yes sir amen knowing him
[1:14:14] in the flesh after Jesus left Paul Peter
[1:14:17] to said I just go fishing he didn't even
[1:14:19] he didn't he didn't even know what to do
[1:14:20] he just went back to his old his old
[1:14:22] haunts yeah see there's been no Peter
[1:14:24] when you're converted feed my
[1:14:27] sheep so Peter eventually the B they
[1:14:31] they they go on to say concerning Christ
[1:14:35] that we knew him in the flesh but
[1:14:37] henceforth said the Apostle know we him
[1:14:41] no
[1:14:41] longer we knew him in the flesh but now
[1:14:44] we know him by the flesh no longer we
[1:14:48] know him in a greater way than when we
[1:14:50] knew him in the flesh all right
[1:14:54] right so he says Peter had seen him in
[1:14:58] flesh but he didn't know him by flesh
[1:15:01] because Jesus said so Flesh and Blood
[1:15:03] didn't reveal it to you even my own life
[1:15:07] didn't reveal it to you but my Father
[1:15:10] which is in heaven has revealed it to
[1:15:13] you do you see why loving me as your
[1:15:17] pastor cannot give you eternal
[1:15:22] life the not a person in this building
[1:15:24] that I don't fully know loves me with a
[1:15:26] great love and if I could save you I
[1:15:29] would if I could give you eternal life I
[1:15:32] would amen that if I could do the
[1:15:35] greatest thing for you I'd give you
[1:15:37] eternal life the problem is it's not
[1:15:39] mine to give but what I can do is lead
[1:15:42] you to eternal life I can take you there
[1:15:46] if you'll come along with me and get you
[1:15:49] eternal life see so so so he says here
[1:15:54] see even even my own life didn't reveal
[1:15:57] it to you but my Father which is in
[1:15:59] heaven has revealed the thing the things
[1:16:02] to you that he is the word of God and
[1:16:05] Upon This Rock I'll build my church
[1:16:09] Peter didn't know him by flesh man
[1:16:12] walked and handled him and everything
[1:16:15] else John says that we handled him we
[1:16:17] handled the Word of Life see all of them
[1:16:20] had had had a a a flesh experience with
[1:16:23] Jesus of Nazareth but not
[1:16:26] Paul all right you still with
[1:16:30] me Paul had something
[1:16:34] greater than any of the Apostles
[1:16:37] did wait a minute I thought th this
[1:16:40] breaks the rules of adding and
[1:16:42] subtracting you just said the apostles
[1:16:44] had something Peter that that the
[1:16:46] apostles had something Paul didn't have
[1:16:49] so now he should have less than they got
[1:16:51] but now brother brandham is saying no
[1:16:53] because he had less he had
[1:16:56] more you see what's happening they said
[1:17:00] well I've got more of a revelation than
[1:17:02] you Paul because you know I walked with
[1:17:05] him I went fishing with him one day I
[1:17:09] heard him talk he sat in a boat with me
[1:17:12] and actually told me let's go over here
[1:17:14] and fish in this place and we'll get
[1:17:16] more fish and we did it see see we seen
[1:17:21] him do things
[1:17:24] but Paul saw him after he was dead
[1:17:28] buried rose again and expressed himself
[1:17:32] in the pillar of fire that led the
[1:17:34] children of Israel amen see isn't that
[1:17:39] amazing and so he
[1:17:41] says but the only way you're saved is by
[1:17:47] know him by Revelation amen amen so so
[1:17:52] knowing him in the flesh didn't save any
[1:17:55] of the disciples they had not even even
[1:17:58] Peter and James and John and all of them
[1:18:00] as as gallon as great a men as they were
[1:18:03] and we couldn't hold a light to them
[1:18:04] today but they had to have a
[1:18:08] revelation an experience and it had to
[1:18:11] exceed Matthew 16 Peter understood the
[1:18:14] identity of Jesus in Matthew 16 but
[1:18:16] after he was converted he had even a
[1:18:18] greater
[1:18:20] understanding see
[1:18:23] so what do you mean then brother Jason
[1:18:27] by the disciples were human whereas Paul
[1:18:32] wasn't
[1:18:35] human Paul had a less
[1:18:39] encumbered understanding because he
[1:18:42] hadn't been Human by living with
[1:18:46] Jesus in his
[1:18:48] Humanity now did I did I just read it to
[1:18:51] you y'all don't go into vapor loock on
[1:18:53] me I just read brother brand is saying
[1:18:54] this
[1:18:56] see because remember that to try to
[1:18:59] correlate Everything Jesus said if you
[1:19:02] hung out with him I mean John said
[1:19:05] goodness even if if I wrote everything
[1:19:08] he said the the world couldn't even
[1:19:09] contain the
[1:19:11] books so imagine trying to correlate all
[1:19:14] that you heard him say and living with
[1:19:17] him for three and a half years if if for
[1:19:20] no other reason then that's a lot you
[1:19:22] you got a lot more to focus that Paul
[1:19:26] didn't have to get focused Because by
[1:19:29] the by the time now listen friends God
[1:19:33] I'm G to say it to you God designed that
[1:19:37] Paul would avoid
[1:19:40] that Paul would avoid that God could
[1:19:43] could have easily let Paul meet him in
[1:19:44] the flesh Paul could have Paul's Paul's
[1:19:47] Mentor knew about Jesus
[1:19:50] galio he had stood there and and in the
[1:19:53] trial at at the Sanhedrin Paul Paul Paul
[1:19:57] never saw him never met him nothing
[1:19:59] there there's no no record anywhere and
[1:20:01] and and but we find that God could have
[1:20:04] easily done that and God didn't do that
[1:20:07] God uh elected that Paul would avoid
[1:20:11] that kind of interaction with Jesus when
[1:20:13] Paul meets Jesus he's already turned
[1:20:17] back to the pillar of fire that led
[1:20:19] Moses and the children of Israel amen
[1:20:23] the same one who created the whole world
[1:20:26] that's why Paul called him Lord capital
[1:20:29] L O R D he Paul knew brother bam said he
[1:20:33] knew better than to call that Pillar of
[1:20:34] Fire anything else he knew that he
[1:20:37] already knew what John had written in
[1:20:39] the beginning was the word and it was
[1:20:40] with God and it was God he already knew
[1:20:43] that was the same Pillar of Fire that
[1:20:45] led
[1:20:46] Moses see now that encourages me you
[1:20:51] know because I encourages me to be a
[1:20:54] part of the generation that that didn't
[1:20:56] get the privilege of going hunting and
[1:20:58] fishing with brother brandham amen not
[1:21:02] saying that wasn't a great privilege I'm
[1:21:04] just saying I didn't get I I I I you
[1:21:06] know I but but let me say it like this
[1:21:09] you know and I'm I'm not I'm not I don't
[1:21:12] want to use the word hindered I'm using
[1:21:13] the word human so it it does encourage
[1:21:16] me that I didn't get the privilege of
[1:21:19] going fishing and hunting with him but
[1:21:23] brother Brandon come backing to coming
[1:21:24] back to our quote the only way you're
[1:21:26] saved is by know him by a revelation so
[1:21:32] that's why I'm not using hindered that's
[1:21:34] why uh one because one wouldn't be
[1:21:36] hindered to have such a privilege I'm
[1:21:38] not saying that the disciples got
[1:21:40] hindered I'm just saying they got human
[1:21:42] I'm not saying that those who hunted and
[1:21:44] fished with William brandham were
[1:21:45] hindered I'm just saying they got human
[1:21:48] and but but I'm here to tell you listen
[1:21:51] friends so so this is exact listen this
[1:21:54] is exactly this is exactly
[1:21:58] why that that we both play tapes
[1:22:04] constantly but also exactly why we don't
[1:22:08] play tapes
[1:22:11] only for that very
[1:22:14] reason that's why we play them
[1:22:17] constantly but that's also why we don't
[1:22:19] play them
[1:22:20] only oh Hallelujah got a living
[1:22:23] experience with the god of Elijah I've
[1:22:27] met the same Pillar of Fire that would
[1:22:29] came on the platform with
[1:22:31] him
[1:22:34] see you see here here here's the point
[1:22:37] I'm really trying to make you remember
[1:22:39] my text from last Sunday God we were in
[1:22:42] Hebrews one God who in Sundre times back
[1:22:46] in the past Paul's breaking it down he's
[1:22:48] showing you remember I said last week
[1:22:50] I'm trying to take you and show you the
[1:22:52] the the forward progress he said God in
[1:22:55] sunnd times he spoke to the to his
[1:22:58] people through the prophets and then in
[1:23:00] the days of Jesus Earthly Ministry he
[1:23:03] spoke to them in his human flesh oh my
[1:23:07] but today by the Holy Ghost he's now
[1:23:10] speaking in his body he's still
[1:23:13] speaking he spoke in sundary times
[1:23:16] through Old Testament prophets he spoke
[1:23:18] in Jesus and now he's speaking in a
[1:23:21] bride in the last day in your life is a
[1:23:24] voice of the Resurrection
[1:23:27] hallelujah oh my that's what the devil
[1:23:31] fears it still has the same
[1:23:34] Authority it still has the same power it
[1:23:37] still has the everything that it's ever
[1:23:40] had it has only now even in a greater
[1:23:43] way cuz now the Old Testament prophets
[1:23:46] couldn't have the new birth you have by
[1:23:48] the Holy Ghost it wasn't yet
[1:23:49] given and even even Jesus Jesus was one
[1:23:53] man walking the shores of Galilee going
[1:23:55] about doing good but he said except
[1:23:57] according if we die it won't do you any
[1:24:00] good it'll biteth alone but if it die
[1:24:03] it'll come back in a many membered body
[1:24:05] and that's the whole reason I'm going to
[1:24:08] Calvary
[1:24:10] amen
[1:24:12] so I for one am glad to notify you that
[1:24:17] he is a living
[1:24:21] experience I'm glad today to notify you
[1:24:26] that he's not just mere
[1:24:29] Doctrine he's not just mere teaching and
[1:24:33] that oh friend you have no you if you
[1:24:36] could only absorb if you could only
[1:24:38] absorb the real value in just that that
[1:24:42] he's not just doctrinal teaching he's a
[1:24:45] living experience and that's important
[1:24:47] because we have a very human
[1:24:49] life and we must deal with real
[1:24:52] realities that that can't just be always
[1:24:56] explained in spiritual terms or rousing
[1:24:59] sermons we Face a very real world and a
[1:25:03] very Wicked World and a very real and
[1:25:06] wicked devil and demons are not
[1:25:08] impressed with message Doctrine they're
[1:25:11] not impressed with message
[1:25:14] cliches they're not impressed they're
[1:25:16] not afraid of that at all the word
[1:25:18] listen the word of This Day offers you a
[1:25:21] living reality and that's what the devil
[1:25:24] is afraid
[1:25:27] of I need to know how to leave my home
[1:25:29] as a Christian go into town in Satan's
[1:25:33] Eden and come home the same Christian
[1:25:35] that's I need to be able to go on the
[1:25:37] job I need to be able to operate my
[1:25:39] vehicle I need to be able to be on my
[1:25:41] laptop a Christian and when I close the
[1:25:43] lid I'm still a Christian
[1:25:46] hallelujah
[1:25:48] hallelujah oh my friends the answer is
[1:25:51] Not Mere mechanic or or it's not even
[1:25:53] just Supernatural happenings in the life
[1:25:56] and Ministry of of God's great prophet
[1:25:58] it's more than that listen in Joshua 6
[1:26:01] it was the people who had to March
[1:26:03] around Jericho it was the people who had
[1:26:06] to who had to shout on the seventh day
[1:26:09] it was the people when the walls came
[1:26:11] down and every man just took off right
[1:26:13] in front of him and conquered whatever
[1:26:15] was standing in front of him they
[1:26:17] wouldn't have been able to do that with
[1:26:18] just a story from Joshua they had to get
[1:26:22] involved it's hearing recognizing and
[1:26:25] acting upon the word of
[1:26:27] God
[1:26:31] hallelujah
[1:26:34] see after hearing and
[1:26:36] recognizing I want to make a point to
[1:26:38] you before I
[1:26:42] close I'll make this my last one you
[1:26:46] good after hearing and
[1:26:50] recognizing the real strength is in
[1:26:52] acting that's good on the word yes
[1:26:56] sir
[1:26:57] see going to say that again it's not
[1:26:59] that there's not a strength in hearing
[1:27:02] there the Bible says there's a blessing
[1:27:03] in just reading the Bible there's even a
[1:27:05] blessing in just hearing it
[1:27:08] read so it's not that hearing there's
[1:27:11] not a blessing and
[1:27:13] recognizing wow that's really valuable
[1:27:17] that'll put some real some real strength
[1:27:20] in you to recognize cuz when you
[1:27:22] recognize the word you realize God is
[1:27:24] speaking directly to
[1:27:26] you but it's acting on the word is where
[1:27:30] real strength develops you say brother
[1:27:34] Jason that's that's counterintuitive
[1:27:36] because I need strength to act on the
[1:27:38] word what you need is to exercise your
[1:27:42] faith exercise your faith and build your
[1:27:49] strength you remember the Lord chastised
[1:27:51] Brother Bram and standing in the
[1:27:54] Gap the Lord chastised brother brandham
[1:27:57] for always having to move him to
[1:28:00] everything and the Lord chastised him
[1:28:02] for that lord said why do I always have
[1:28:04] to move you to everything and you know
[1:28:08] and the Lord said to brother brandham
[1:28:10] where is your
[1:28:11] reward you mean I got a reward yeah this
[1:28:15] is a partnership this a family affair
[1:28:19] you're how about you be a joint air with
[1:28:21] Christ how about you be a partaker we
[1:28:24] are partakers that means you're a
[1:28:26] partaker I'm a partaker I'm a joint Heir
[1:28:30] with
[1:28:31] Christ amen so so brother brandham you
[1:28:35] know the the the problem was that that
[1:28:37] you know he he because he he was so uh
[1:28:42] he let people
[1:28:44] complexing and he didn't want to he
[1:28:47] didn't want to have a critic that could
[1:28:49] say a word amen
[1:28:52] and he and then he and he come a
[1:28:54] challenge right after the seals and his
[1:28:56] heart was smashed because here he was
[1:28:58] the greatest thing of his whole entire
[1:29:01] Ministry those seals said it was every
[1:29:03] bit thus sayith the Lord the greatest
[1:29:04] thing and he didn't top that till he got
[1:29:06] to the token and then that was even
[1:29:09] another level and so when brother
[1:29:11] brandham is now he's come to the climax
[1:29:13] he's come to the opening of the seals
[1:29:15] the greatest event to the Christian
[1:29:17] church in 2,000 years since the word had
[1:29:19] got sealed up under Seven Seals
[1:29:22] and you would think that that would have
[1:29:24] won the day but it actually pushed him
[1:29:27] further into further into
[1:29:31] rejection because before you know he
[1:29:33] stood between them a nice guy you know
[1:29:35] between the trinitarians and the Oneness
[1:29:37] and brothers were brothers and let's be
[1:29:38] brothers and doesn't matter what church
[1:29:40] you go to and let's just all be one for
[1:29:42] all and you know he's a very nice man
[1:29:44] and very kind-hearted and very humble
[1:29:47] and even his critics gave up that that
[1:29:48] he was a very Christian humble Christian
[1:29:50] man nothing nothing to say against his
[1:29:53] life at all no no way to bring a charge
[1:29:56] against him here's a man who went 33
[1:29:58] years of ministry and there never was
[1:30:00] anyone who ever rose up who knew him who
[1:30:03] lived around him who heard him preach
[1:30:05] who followed him around the world no one
[1:30:07] even his critics ever brought a single
[1:30:09] railing accusation against his character
[1:30:12] not one not one in 33
[1:30:15] years never even brought into question
[1:30:19] he was always considered a humble Lord
[1:30:22] got even the ones who disagreed with his
[1:30:24] Doctrine and thought that he got serpent
[1:30:27] seed some old man out of the Wilderness
[1:30:29] must have come and told him
[1:30:30] that even the ones who disagreed with
[1:30:33] his Doctrine and thought he was a false
[1:30:36] prophet none of them accused him of of
[1:30:39] of a an illicit life or lying or
[1:30:44] deceitfulness see so you can understand
[1:30:47] then my disdain for the people who try
[1:30:50] to come more than half a century later
[1:30:52] and try to bring that charge that is
[1:30:53] stupid at the highest
[1:30:56] level so and I don't want to get off on
[1:30:59] that today but I just want you to know
[1:31:01] something friends you can be proud of
[1:31:03] this messenger that God sent to us
[1:31:08] amen they could find no no charge
[1:31:10] against
[1:31:12] him but but but and and even brother
[1:31:15] Brandon could stand there in June of 63
[1:31:18] and after after almost 30 years of
[1:31:21] ministry say there's never been a a
[1:31:23] mistake in the ministry and he said
[1:31:26] around the world and he challenged them
[1:31:28] from International pull pits not in a
[1:31:30] closet somewhere from International pull
[1:31:32] pits challenged anyone to come forward
[1:31:34] if they ever knew of anything that was
[1:31:36] said thus sayith the lord of the
[1:31:37] thousands of times there was ever an
[1:31:39] error in it no one no one around the
[1:31:44] world but but don't think the devil
[1:31:47] don't know how to use that against
[1:31:49] you and when he brought the opening of
[1:31:53] the seals then we find that because the
[1:31:56] world didn't suddenly all become
[1:31:59] Believers it affected him he was a human
[1:32:02] being it gave him a
[1:32:04] complex and that's what standing in the
[1:32:06] Gap is all about God coming to him and
[1:32:09] saying why do I always have to drive you
[1:32:11] to everything why do I always got to
[1:32:14] move you where's your reward where's the
[1:32:16] exercise of your faith and brother brand
[1:32:19] said because I I just didn't ever want
[1:32:22] to make a mistake and I didn't what what
[1:32:24] he was really confessing was his complex
[1:32:26] didn't want to give a Critic
[1:32:28] something and because of that Satan had
[1:32:31] complexed him and now he said I let the
[1:32:34] sick lay sick and I'm waiting on a
[1:32:36] vision why did I do that he said he said
[1:32:38] from this hour he said I'm going to go
[1:32:40] forward he said whether I know I've got
[1:32:42] the word of the Lord or not I'm going to
[1:32:44] believe by faith you understand God
[1:32:46] needed him stronger than he was he
[1:32:48] couldn't be of service broke down in a
[1:32:50] complex and God said you got to exercise
[1:32:54] your faith where's your reward in it go
[1:32:57] forward but what if I make a mistake God
[1:33:00] is in control of it
[1:33:02] all brother said even sometimes in the
[1:33:05] Bible this is the scripture is is filled
[1:33:07] with examples where God allowed his
[1:33:10] servants to make a mistake and then God
[1:33:13] turned around the devil and took the
[1:33:15] victory right took took the victory
[1:33:17] right away from the devil and made it a
[1:33:20] glorious thing for God's
[1:33:24] family I am I am encouraged by the
[1:33:28] failures of Samson because he won in the
[1:33:30] end I'm encouraged by the failures of
[1:33:33] David because it didn't stop the promise
[1:33:37] and God still put a man on his throne
[1:33:40] and nothing David did in his failure
[1:33:42] could stop it and there's nothing I can
[1:33:44] do or you can do to break down the
[1:33:46] promise of God
[1:33:49] hallelujah no wonder friends we don't
[1:33:51] want just to have a Doctrine want to
[1:33:53] have a living
[1:33:55] experience is that what you want today a
[1:33:58] living
[1:34:00] experience you've got a great
[1:34:02] reward exercise your
[1:34:05] faith don't wait for it to fall on your
[1:34:08] head don't wait fory dust exercise go
[1:34:11] forward have faith believe
[1:34:14] God God wants a a a church of Warriors
[1:34:18] he wants a Church of Champions he wants
[1:34:20] a church of people with courage he wants
[1:34:22] to see young people filled up with his
[1:34:25] life he wants to see married home
