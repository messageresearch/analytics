========================================

Amen. God bless you this morning to be in the house of the Lord. if you don't mind those that are here just come standing with me and we're going to read our text here out of Proverbs going to do two portions of scripture um Proverbs 22 just one verse 22 and verse 6 it says train up a child in the way that he should go and when he is old he will not depart from it amen and then if you turn over to Proverbs 31 we're going to catch verse 10 and then verse 27 and verse 28. Verse 10 says, "Who can find a virtuous woman for her price is far above rubies." And then moving down to 27 says, "She lookth well to the ways of her household and eateth not the bread of idleness. Her children arise up and call her blessed, her husband also, and he praiseth her." Let's just pray. Heavenly Father, we thank you for the reading of your word today. Thank you for just Lord coming together and being able to worship you, Father. Pray you just open up this word to us, Father. Be with the Lord, the musicians as they prepare. Be with the minister as he prepares to bring the word, Lord. And may Lord, just during this Sunday school, we just be able to give you glory in something. We ask it now in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. God bless you this morning as you take your seats. So today is Mother's Day. Amen. So, happy Mother's Day to all the mothers out there, all the moms. Um, I just had it on my heart to say a few words this morning along the lines of that celebration. Um, amen. So, you know, one of the beautiful things that always sticks out to me is the self-sacrifice that true mothers have that true mothers really have towards their children and towards their family. Um, you know, there's a life that of course that they lead before they have children. You know, they they fall in love and and they get married. But when a child comes into the picture, it's it's almost like a new world has been created for them. Amen. And um, you know, it's just like when we come to the Lord, there's something about the correlation there. You know, it mirrors the new birth beautifully. And I think, you know, God crafted it that way. I think it's a monumental concept to grasp as Christians that when we've passed from death into life. Um it's not that we've somehow taken something new and planted it into our lives, right? Like we're just living our life and something was added to it like it's a piece of the puzzle. It's not supposed to be like that. It's an it's an experience that takes you out of your old life and puts you into a new life. Amen. Old things are passed away and all things are become new. Amen. And as I was thinking about that subject last night, I just began to ponder how that can get really twisted, you know, in the world that we live in, you know, in Christianity especially, but even in in parenthood in general, it's it's a misunderstanding that it's just a part of your life. you know it rather than it being a whole new life. Amen. Something my wife and I we were talking about and we've we've talked about this many times is is our life before we had kids and then life since we've had kids and you know the dramatic change that it plays into your life. You know, there's just there's no comparison. And but I've but what I've seen is um you know and I've had you know friends like this and and acquaintances that that in parents is that they have kids and what they try to do is that they try to fit their kids into their life, right? And it's and it's really sad. It's it's as if no real change takes place other than that now there's another person in the picture but no real self-sacrifice takes place. they don't actually make changes to their life. They're just cramming another thing into their schedule. Like, you know, sometimes it is almost as if it's an inconvenience when in reality it's one of the greatest blessings that can ever take place. Amen. Um now I know that anybody that has kids there is a certain amount of sacrifice inherently that takes place just by the nature of it you know and I get that you lose sleep you know they cost money things are different and I get that those things are sacrifices but I believe that there is another layer that goes into this kind of sacrifice that I'm talking about something that goes beyond just kind of the physical things you know you start to put your needs you start to put the needs of your children above your own needs and above your own wants and above your own desires. You don't try to fit them into all of your needs and your wants and your desires. You, you know, they're it's it's just a totally different life. Amen. Um, you know, you start to realize that it's more than just it's it goes far beyond just putting food on the table and having clothes and having a roof over their heads. You know, those things are important and those are part of it, but it's a greater there's a greater depth to it. Amen. I was reading through a message Brother Random preaches um titled Mother's Day. Amen. And he uh he's actually quoting the the movie The Ten Commandments. So, so I don't get in trouble. I'm just going to read what he said. Amen. Um he he's talking about Moses, his mother, Jockabed. And he says, I believe it was the Ten Commandments, the late Cecil Deill, that wrote and put this on screen, one of the masterpieces of the movie world. And before it was put on the scene or let out, Cecil Deill called Oral Roberts and Deeus Shicarion and a bunch of the full gospel ministers and took them into his own studios and showed the four hours of the Ten Commandments and asked them their opinion of it, God rest his gallant soul. And when I seen it, I was looking at it and a little remark always stuck out to me. If uh many of you who did see it, it was the daughter of Pharaoh. After Moses had found that he was a Hebrew and he decided to go dwell with his people. And there sat his once beautiful mother faded out with her gray hair and her wrinkled face sitting in an old armchair, a typical mother. And the Pharaoh's daughter came in, which is the mother that had adopted him, and said, "Who?" And Moses said, "Whose son am I anyhow?" And when it was brought to light that Jack Jacobed was his real mother, the daughter of Pharaoh with her paint and so forth and all fixed up, she said, "But look, he may be your son, but she said, I give him wealth and splendor. You could have given him nothing but the slime pits." And but the aged old gray woman, gay-headed woman's mother said, "But I give him life." And that makes the difference. I give him life. God gave him eternal life. and how true the mother is there. I just began thinking about thinking about Moses's real mother and how she had made such an impact on him. Even though that she was forced to give him up, God made a way for her to nurse that child. I always I've always been so amazed by that, you know, that God made a way even though that, you know, that was a really a tough time if you put yourself into her shoes. you know, for a couple of months, the Bible said she hid her son because at that time, Pharaoh was trying to kill all the boys. And so, she hid her son, but then the Bible says that there came a time where she could hid her son no longer. So, then she and Miriam crafted that little that, you know, that little they weaved that basket and they put him into that basket. I mean, you think of the the trust that this mother had to, you know, put in God to do all these things, you know, and all all the stress that was involved in this situation and put him he put him in the basket and and and then, you know, basically was knew that she was going to have to give him up. Um, and there's no specific age the Bible says, but you know, I just was kind of just doing some research and around that time in history, you know, nursing a child, weaning a child could have been all the way up into three, four, five years old. And so, even though that Moses grew up with the wealth and all of the splendor and all of those things naturally that he would need, none of that kept him from what God called him to do. And the impact of of her influence in him lasted her, you know, her his whole life. Um, Brother Bam says this in the invasion of the United States. I I just some quotes this morning. It says to you little mothers here this morning that's been real mothers. I know there's many of you. I think every one of you. Uh, let me just tell you something. God bless you. You're the fifth gospel. I think let me tell you what now for your children. just a little thing because uh brother Neville will probably preach about mothers tonight or whoever. Um but let me tell you something. Let me ask you something. Remember when Moses was a little boy, it was a mother who gave him in his instruction. It was a godly mother who took little Moses on her knees and said Moses and taught him awe. He was her teacher or she was his teacher rather under Pharaoh. Now these things said Moses someday you're going to deliver the children of Israel. You're the boy that's called. Keep yourself pure and unspotted from the world for you're the one. You are the one. No other place do we know where he ever went to any s seminary or teaching he he ever got. He stayed right in Pharaoh's palace which was heathen. But his mother taught him. That's a real mother. She taught him the precepts of the Lord. She taught him how he must be holy. She taught him how and what he must live and how and what God must do and would do for him. And it stuck with Moses all the days of his life. And any good true loyal mother that that'll take her little babies instead of send them send sending them to picture shows and dances and so forth like that and she'll put them on her lap and teach them about the the Lord Jesus Christ, you know. And I I'm so blessed that I had a mom like that that taught me about the Lord. I'm so blessed that I have a wife that has that desire in her heart that that puts the Lord Jesus, you know, at the top of the list. Amen. And everything else is underneath that. And I thought about this is just the title this morning was the fifth gospel. I thought about what brother Brandham calls the mother as the the fifth gospel because he does that cuz it m they make such an impact on their kids as they grow up, you know. You know, contrasting just today's society of motherhood, the fifth gospel has become the daycare that they attend. It has become the school that they go to. It has become all of these other things and and it has taken the place of what God had intended for the fifth gospel to be. Um I I found this quote. I'm sorry for all these quotes this morning, but I just um how the Lord led me and this struck me. It says, "You know what? I think everybody has their own opinion, but one of the greatest, to my opinion, the greatest president that we ever had in this nation was Abraham Lincoln. Not because he was a Republican, but because he was a godly man and he was raised to serve God. And he said, "If there's anything I want to give praise for, or my life was influenced by was a godly mother who taught me to pray and to know Jesus as my savior. Oh, your family is what you are. Your and I, and I, this caught my attention. You raise your children in a certain environment and it's got a 98% better chance to go right than it has if you bring it up in the wrong way. Bring up a child in the way that it should go and when it's old, it will not depart from it. Be brought up right. Teach your children to do right and be honest, to be square and fair, and even when they're in school. The Bible says that we are written epistles read of all men. And and I just thought about that scripture just to carry it, you know, a bit further. I believe that we are, you know, as parents and especially mothers that we are read most of all by our children because we spend, you know, the most we spend the most time with them. Um, and when a mother gives up her desires and she gives up her hobbies and she gives up her physical well-being for a season, you know, I think that is read by the children more than anybody else and it has a lifelong impact on them. Amen. And you know, because even if they never say it or they maybe they never even realize it, they recognize how important they were in their mother's life. And that it in itself can make a true impact. You know, you see somebody and I don't know if you've I mean, I'm sure everybody in this room in this church this morning has been in the presence of somebody who doesn't give them the time of day. Amen. You know, you're talking with them and they're looking at their phone. you know, they they you know, they stop paying attention to you. You know, they you know, you're you're you're you're this high to them. Everything else is more important. And kids above anybody else, I think, really feel that and and know the impact of that. And when we as believers and as fathers and as mothers can really give up some of those things even things that we love. I mean it's not saying you can't have hobbies and you can't have these things but you know just inherently it takes it takes those things away. It puts them on a shelf for a long period of time and then you give yourself over to those kids. And if you don't do that, I believe that the kids can really know and they I mean, even if you don't ever say it, they know because they see what are you doing with your time, you know, what are you investing in? Are you investing in me or are you investing in these other things? You know, and I just I think they recognize how important they were. There's this um there's this wicked queen in the Old Testament. Um I was reading this about this this morning. I'm sure we're all familiar with it. Not much is spoken about her but her name was Athaliah and she was evil. She was the wife of King Gerro um there in the reign of the kings. Um he was the king who did wicked in the sight of the Lord out of many and he was the one who died of the bad in intestinal stomach disease. She was so evil that at one point she took an opportunity to eradicate the entire royal family or so she was hoping it would do uh eradicate the whole family which meant that she actually killed her grandkids and she was almost successful in taking out her the royal family but there was the one that survived but during a time in this in this span of history she did actually reign over the land for for a time and she did a lot of wicked things. She was known for her violence establishing Baal worship. And what's amazing is funny enough is that she was also the daughter of Jezebel. Amen. And I read this statement, you know, and we all know who Jezebel was. You know, she did she did and was everything except what a true mother was. Amen. Um I read this statement from the National Library of Medicine, this medical website, and there's this hypo hypothesis called the cycle of violence. The cycle of violence hypothesis predicts that individuals exposed to child abuse are more likely to be physically violent in adulthood and it's well supported by literature. However, a growing number of studies suggest that child neglect may be equally predictive or more predictive of adult violent behavior over child physical abuse. Now, Athalia obviously had quite a bit of neglect in her life. Her dad was raising up idol worship in the kingdom. Her mom, Jezebel, like I said, was doing everything except being what she was supposed to be, which was a mother. And then their child had was raised up in this environment. And we can see the the product of that neglect and how sad that was. Um and and you just think of it today and all the children raising up and you know with even modern science which is what people look at even modern science telling us that children that suffer neglect are incredibly likely to turn out the wrong way and think of the neglect. I mean brother Brandham talked about it back in the 50s and the 60s and talking about parent delinquency and think of the neglect that takes place. It's not child abuse isn't you know there there is child abuse and I know that takes place but child abuse can also happen in the form of neglect and you know we ran into this family and you know they spent less than an hour a day with their kids you know they went they took their kids to school it was you know just three or four years old and then you know they took them to daycare because they paid for daycare and then when they took them home they just put them right to bed and they had absolutely no influence on on the children and I recognize in the society we live in, there are situations that, you know, people, you know, they have to both individuals have to work, but I think there are sacrifices that can be made to spend more time with your kids and not have that kind of neglect. Amen. Um, and it just stirs something up in me as a father, you know, and I know it does all of those godly mothers, it does the same thing. And and um just some encouragement this morning. You know, brother Brandham, and we talked about this in that quote, brother Brenham often refers to Abraham Lincoln and how he attributed much of his faith-driven life to his godly mother, you know, and Abraham Lincoln said this, this was a direct quote from him. He says, "No man is poor that has a godly mother." And what I thought was incredible, I just looked up what at what age was Abraham Lincoln when his mother died, and he was only 9 years old when his mom died. So she had that much of an impact on him um you know in his very early childhood. Um and the impact of her prayers and her influence lasted his entire life. Uh you know and he also refers to John Wesley. He had all those children and still found it uh so important to spend all that time in with the Lord. Char Charles Wesley's mom, John Wesley's mom. Uh and another one that I found uh was Charles Spurgeon actually makes this statement of his mother and said, "Never could it be possible for any man to estimate what he owes to a godly mother." And I just thought how amazing that was. Um, you know, and and I just want to say this morning that, you know, um, all of what I was saying, you know, wasn't directed at anybody in here because I see godly mothers in here and I see, you know, and I'm so blessed to have all of all of those all of you in our life. And I know your kids are equally as blessed. I just wanted to give a little encouragement. May God bless those those gallant mothers who are the fifth gospel, you know, to their children. May May the Lord richly richly bless you and encourage you in your heroic efforts. You are a blessing that is priceless. Amen. An absolute priceless blessing to God bless you. Let's just pray. Heavenly Father, we thank you for this day, Lord. We thank you for all that you are and all that you do for us, Lord Jesus. We thank you for just uh this opportunity to be in your house. Lord, we love you. We just commit our ways to you now. In the name of Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. [Music]
