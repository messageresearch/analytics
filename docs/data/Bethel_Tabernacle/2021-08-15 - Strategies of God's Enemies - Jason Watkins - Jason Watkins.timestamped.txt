[2:09] praise the lord good morning america
[2:13] amen
[2:15] let's just stand our feet and open in
[2:17] prayer and put my presentation up folks
[2:24] father we thank you for this morning
[2:26] thank you for the group gathered out
[2:28] here master now
[2:30] of course we have material laid before
[2:32] us but lord without the anointing of the
[2:34] holy spirit it would just be word only
[2:37] lord but the word
[2:39] lord it came in power and demonstration
[2:41] it wasn't in just a word only that would
[2:45] lord deal with the conscience of man but
[2:47] it must reach down into the soul and of
[2:49] course
[2:50] only you can do that
[2:52] so we commit ourselves to you right now
[2:55] humble our heart before you lord and in
[2:57] your presence may you teach us your word
[2:59] we committed to you in jesus name amen
[3:02] praise the lord amen
[3:06] so um
[3:09] okay
[3:10] so i'm gonna drive it here
[3:14] amen
[3:16] amen
[3:18] we have um
[3:20] i believe i have my
[3:23] all of my
[3:24] uh powerpoints or i mean all of my
[3:26] slides
[3:27] with the scriptures that we will need
[3:30] so we're looking today you can be seated
[3:32] i'm terribly sorry
[3:34] strategies
[3:36] of god's spiritual enemies now i think
[3:40] that that
[3:41] i
[3:42] you know as you've heard me say before
[3:44] i don't take titles lightly
[3:46] um
[3:47] titles to me because i i i'm very
[3:51] much aware that if you don't get the
[3:54] meaning right off the bat sometimes
[3:56] uh then that can really be costly and by
[3:59] the time you catch up
[4:00] especially on a sunday school lesson
[4:02] like this
[4:03] then we're already
[4:05] already ahead of you and it's difficult
[4:08] to gather it all so when we look then at
[4:11] this topic i want to take and i believe
[4:15] i have it in my very first slide
[4:18] first timothy 4
[4:20] 1.
[4:21] i don't know if that screen is like
[4:23] angled up or something it doesn't look
[4:25] right somehow so maybe between services
[4:27] like needs to come over
[4:42] amen it can crash all at once but don't
[4:44] hurt my big boy there
[4:46] took me forever to find him years
[4:48] literally in the in the hunt around the
[4:50] world and i finally found him so
[4:53] amen i usually walk out and you good
[4:55] yeah me too yeah good okay
[5:00] first timothy 4 1
[5:03] and so we read here now the spirit
[5:06] speaketh expressly
[5:08] that in the latter times
[5:11] some shall depart from the faith giving
[5:14] heed to seducing spirits and doctrines
[5:17] of devils now one of the first things
[5:20] that i want you to to realize is that
[5:24] you can see that the word apostasy is
[5:27] there and that's quite intentional uh by
[5:30] the authors
[5:32] in the in the version of the bible that
[5:34] i use the king james bible i have the
[5:36] the editor put that there but i want you
[5:39] to notice something that apostasy
[5:43] is not
[5:45] limited to just the end time a lot of
[5:46] times we say that we go
[5:48] the great apostasy we go oh yeah at the
[5:50] end time but he even here speaks about
[5:54] the spirit speaketh expressly that in
[5:57] the latter times
[5:59] some shall depart from the faith giving
[6:02] heed to seducing spirits and doctrines
[6:04] of devils now granted our scripture is
[6:08] dealing categorically and rather
[6:10] specifically with the latter times how
[6:13] many believe we're in that
[6:15] but you want to understand that we're
[6:17] not saying oh you know wow news flash
[6:21] there's a great apostasy at the end
[6:23] apostasy actually began
[6:26] um
[6:27] even as far back as the early church and
[6:30] so when we think about apostasy we're
[6:32] talking about how that you know this is
[6:35] where
[6:36] uh anything that begins to pull away
[6:38] from the word of god from the very
[6:41] earliest days was apostasy apostasy
[6:44] means the abandonment
[6:47] of a religious or political belief it
[6:50] could mean the renunciation
[6:52] and so you know it's synonymous in fact
[6:54] is with renunciation of belief
[6:56] abandonment of belief
[6:58] and so
[7:00] you can have paul talking about in the
[7:02] early church where he would say you know
[7:05] i tell you today even weeping
[7:07] that many have departed from the faith
[7:09] and actually paul said have become
[7:12] enemies of the cross now
[7:15] it's it's always been a lesson to me a
[7:17] very deep lesson to my spirit
[7:20] that paul says i tell you that even
[7:23] weeping because there's a very natural
[7:26] tendency to have to have righteous
[7:28] indignation to say they've become
[7:30] enemies of the cross then they're my
[7:32] enemies but this wasn't something that
[7:35] that that angered paul this broke paul
[7:39] it broke his heart
[7:40] and you know i was just listening uh
[7:43] yesterday to brother branham in the
[7:44] sixth seal which we're gonna go along
[7:46] those lines in the main service and
[7:48] brother branham says you know he says at
[7:50] one point in in the first part of the
[7:53] sermon he says
[7:54] how that he says something happened in
[7:56] the room there today said it nearly took
[7:58] my breath and he said i had to walk
[7:59] outside and just walk around he doesn't
[8:01] elaborate on it until he gets to the end
[8:04] when he begins to break it down some
[8:06] more and what he was actually seeing
[8:09] was not some
[8:10] astonishing doctrine he had already got
[8:13] that but he the lord was actually
[8:15] showing him
[8:17] the people and friends that he knew and
[8:19] rubbed shoulders with how that they had
[8:22] missed it and were gonna miss it and
[8:24] even dark shadows were already hanging
[8:27] over their lives he doesn't call any
[8:29] names
[8:30] but it it literally he had to get up and
[8:33] walk around because the impact to say
[8:36] surely not that brother surely not that
[8:38] sister surely not that church and yet we
[8:41] find that the words of jesus are not
[8:44] going to be annulled that
[8:47] that broad is the way that leadeth to
[8:50] destruction and many will go therein and
[8:52] there will only be a very few
[8:55] find the straight and narrow way amen
[8:58] but it should inform our thinking when
[9:00] we read paul's reaction to apostasy that
[9:04] it it shouldn't always just make us rise
[9:06] up and ready to draw a sword and cut
[9:08] somebody's head off and say okay you're
[9:09] done you're out of here forget you we
[9:11] never want to see you again no it it
[9:14] maybe there's nothing we can do about it
[9:16] that's not what i'm talking about but
[9:17] i'm talking about what's the reaction of
[9:19] our heart yeah see what what should be
[9:22] the attitude remember that it is the jew
[9:25] who says give me vengeance brother
[9:27] branham says the gentile says father
[9:30] they know not what they do forgive them
[9:32] they know not what they do now the lord
[9:35] is going to forgive who he will he told
[9:37] moses that i'll have mercy on whom i
[9:38] will
[9:39] and even in times of of when you when
[9:42] you trace revelation um chapter 7 and
[9:46] you go back and trace it with
[9:48] ezekiel chapter 9 there at this opening
[9:51] scene of the tribulation period under
[9:52] the sixth seal
[9:54] you find that that it's so terrible that
[9:57] even ezekiel falls on his face and
[10:00] pleads with god you're going to wipe
[10:02] everybody out have mercy on us my
[10:03] goodness you're killing all of us and
[10:05] the and and you know a lot of times we
[10:08] think well that was ezekiel surely the
[10:10] lord would say
[10:11] okay ezekiel i like you so much i'm
[10:13] gonna do it he didn't do that to moses
[10:15] and he loved moses above everybody but
[10:17] he said moses i will have mercy on whom
[10:19] i'll have mercy and whom i will heart
[10:22] and i'll harden whom i'm going to
[10:24] destroy i'm going to destroy and you
[10:26] remember even even david
[10:29] here you find david with the father's
[10:31] love running trying to save the life of
[10:34] absalom i get it it's his son he who he
[10:37] loved
[10:38] but here david is trying to save a man
[10:40] whom god had already determined to
[10:42] destroy
[10:43] and there wasn't gonna it wasn't gonna
[10:44] happen and so ezekiel begins to plead
[10:47] with the lord and the lord just says
[10:48] they've had their chance ezekiel i've
[10:50] heard their tears before i've always
[10:53] relented i've always spared them i'm not
[10:55] doing it anymore we've reached the end
[10:57] and that's where
[10:59] the tribulation period that's facing the
[11:02] world that was ezekiel 9 and revelation
[11:05] 7 are speaking about the the two
[11:07] witnesses
[11:08] um going there just it correlates with
[11:10] revelation 11 revelation 14 those 144
[11:14] 000 and so you want to real realize
[11:16] friends that those who
[11:19] who go into apostasy
[11:21] do so by their own choosing
[11:23] and that's that you've got to maintain
[11:25] that or it really casts god in an
[11:28] incorrect light that those people
[11:31] are bringing upon themselves
[11:33] retroactive judgment
[11:36] amen and that's huge i remember talking
[11:38] to a magistrate one time
[11:40] at the sheriff's department or somewhere
[11:42] i was talking we were in a conversation
[11:44] and
[11:45] he was saying how that many young men
[11:48] and young women come had come before him
[11:50] and he would often times if he felt
[11:53] compelled to have mercy maybe they had
[11:55] an exceptional case and he just felt a
[11:57] twinge of you know this this warrants a
[11:59] a second chance and so he said more
[12:02] often than not he said i would go ahead
[12:05] and find them guilty according to the
[12:06] evidence
[12:07] he said that was never in question that
[12:09] they were guilty was pretty easy to show
[12:12] he said but then i would sentence them
[12:14] to the standard
[12:17] sentence and say okay this is i sentence
[12:19] you to five years in jail he said
[12:21] however
[12:22] i will under my authority suspend that
[12:25] sentence
[12:27] and that means that that sentence hangs
[12:29] over your head and it's not going to be
[12:31] enforced by anybody because i'm
[12:33] suspending it nobody can enforce it on
[12:35] you the only way that sentence can fall
[12:38] on your head is if you go back out and
[12:40] do that again
[12:42] but if you keep your nose clean and you
[12:44] you stay in the straight and narrow then
[12:46] after after five months that'll go off
[12:48] for you and it'll go away and then
[12:50] you're completely out from under the
[12:51] threat of it and so you know god has
[12:55] in the tribulation period and so so this
[12:57] judge would say when people would come
[13:00] back you know here they got caught doing
[13:01] it again now they're back in front of me
[13:03] say okay
[13:04] you know there's your sentence and they
[13:05] go oh you know you shouldn't do that to
[13:08] me and he said i would always point out
[13:10] to them young man young lady i'm not
[13:12] doing that to you
[13:13] you did that to you i told you last time
[13:16] it was hanging there it was suspended i
[13:19] had mercy but if you did it again you
[13:22] would reach up there and release the
[13:23] cord it's you doing that
[13:26] and so you remember we we read a
[13:28] scripture
[13:29] uh i think last time i was hearing the
[13:31] pulpit of how that people
[13:34] chose the pleasures of
[13:36] they chose sin as their pleasures
[13:39] that they made that conscious choice to
[13:41] do that and that's where apostasy comes
[13:44] in fact is when you go into the bible
[13:47] knowledge commentary you find this
[13:49] as the repository and guardian
[13:53] of the truth the church must be aware of
[13:57] the strategies of the truth's enemies it
[14:00] is crucial then for the church to
[14:02] understand what god has revealed about
[14:06] these enemies all right
[14:08] uh according to this teaching my screen
[14:11] keeps vanishing here for some reason
[14:13] according to this teaching the situation
[14:16] will degenerate as christ's return
[14:19] approaches
[14:20] spiritual error and this is a very large
[14:23] point in fact is i'm almost basing
[14:25] everything in my sunday school lesson
[14:26] today on this next line
[14:28] spiritual error is seldom due to
[14:32] innocent mistakes it is more often due
[14:35] to the conscious strategies of god's
[14:38] spiritual enemies all right now let's
[14:42] look at these statements from brother
[14:43] branham god's power to transform brother
[14:46] branham says she is naked under the word
[14:49] of civilization higher education better
[14:52] civilization higher ethics imagine that
[14:55] even even sometimes they they pass laws
[14:59] with the intention of we need a higher
[15:02] ethical standard here but it doesn't it
[15:05] doesn't change the system you see and
[15:07] and so he says let me be sure that this
[15:11] soaks in and these quotes now here
[15:14] friends especially to youth and young
[15:17] men and young women just starting with
[15:19] their plan for life look at what he says
[15:21] here let me be sure that this soaks in
[15:24] it's all of the devil and will be
[15:27] destroyed at the coming of the lord he
[15:30] goes on further in the invisible union
[15:33] he says when scientific education
[15:36] everything is absolutely contrary to god
[15:40] the whole system of civilization that we
[15:42] have
[15:43] now is absolutely antichrist educational
[15:47] system is antichrist civilization is
[15:50] antichrist it's against god he says
[15:53] further here in leadership
[15:55] oh you see it's this intellectual day
[15:58] that we're living in education
[16:01] civilization and the modern trend of the
[16:04] day
[16:05] is all of the devil civilization of the
[16:08] devil yes sir the bible said it is this
[16:11] civilization has death so who do you
[16:14] imagine it's of
[16:15] see this civilization has death
[16:18] will we have a civil uh civilization
[16:20] like this in the other world no sir
[16:23] we'll have a different kind of
[16:25] civilization
[16:26] education all these things they're of
[16:28] the devil science perverting the natural
[16:30] things making something else
[16:33] finally in the message i knoweth it not
[16:35] now watch the spirit following it there
[16:38] will come a time in the name of the lord
[16:41] that people will go completely insane
[16:45] the bible says so so the bible teaches
[16:48] us that so so it's not
[16:51] um
[16:52] you know it's
[16:54] we we we when we think about a certain
[16:56] scripture that i'm gonna get to here in
[16:57] a minute uh let me go ahead and get it
[17:00] maybe so we can read it first peter 1 13
[17:03] wherefore gird up the loins of your mind
[17:06] be sober and hope to the end for the
[17:09] grace that is to be brought to you at
[17:12] the revelation of jesus christ right let
[17:15] me back up again so
[17:17] wherefore gird up the loins of your mind
[17:20] in other words there is coming a grace
[17:23] at the end time there is coming a
[17:26] special grace you better be thankful to
[17:28] god because you live in an age where it
[17:31] is impossible the earth is too dark too
[17:34] wicked the the gross darkness on the
[17:36] minds of the people
[17:38] men's minds going insane uh civilization
[17:41] education science politics social issues
[17:45] name it whatever you want to name the
[17:48] bible shows us prophetically that it's
[17:51] all orchestrated by
[17:53] and under the control of the antichrist
[17:56] system of the devil all right so so when
[18:00] we think about this time this special
[18:03] grace given for god's family
[18:05] at the end time now it i i want you to
[18:08] to to really get a hold of this fact
[18:11] that god is showing you
[18:13] there's actually a special grace
[18:16] i mean do you realize
[18:18] that this last
[18:20] age
[18:21] unwise virgin
[18:23] from the old testament through 2000
[18:26] years of new testament
[18:28] none of them have to go through the
[18:31] great tribulation period
[18:33] not one of them amen
[18:35] only the last age say
[18:38] gee that's unfair it's not unfair
[18:40] brother branham showed us because
[18:43] this is the age that has the has the
[18:46] greatest
[18:48] the greatest unfolding we have a time
[18:51] you know here before the bride you know
[18:54] that that that we have such a combined
[18:57] understanding of the word made and i
[19:00] mean even a combined understanding i'm
[19:02] not talking about an understanding that
[19:05] we have greater than saint paul but i'm
[19:07] talking about we have a combined
[19:09] perspective
[19:10] we have the history
[19:12] of 2 000 years to look at
[19:14] just our combined perspective uh we have
[19:18] a a manifestation of the bride becoming
[19:21] the word do you realize that that's
[19:23] where the omega church
[19:26] excels beyond the alpha church not in
[19:30] the un not in the revelation of god
[19:33] but the bride actually becoming the word
[19:35] that early church fell away before they
[19:38] could get very far they only went maybe
[19:40] 20 years and it was already corrupting
[19:43] now we've had here friends more than
[19:46] half a century and instead of instead of
[19:49] growing up getting cold and growing away
[19:51] we're getting more we're getting warmer
[19:53] we're getting on more understanding we
[19:55] and and just by virtue of contrast just
[19:58] by the fact that you
[20:00] live in the in the most unique hour
[20:03] unparalleled in history unprecedented in
[20:06] history the convergence of noah and and
[20:09] lots day the lid torn off of hell the
[20:11] atmosphere is filled with demons demon
[20:13] power streaming through the earth amen
[20:16] amen
[20:17] satan is now the god of the evil age
[20:19] it's now satan's eden there has never
[20:21] been a people and just by the fact that
[20:24] you've been called to so much and the
[20:26] age is the worst it's ever been how are
[20:29] you going to do it god said don't worry
[20:31] there's a grace coming when the
[20:33] revelation of jesus christ comes realize
[20:36] you won't be able to meet the the great
[20:38] but don't worry i've got a grace that
[20:41] i'm going to apply to your lives
[20:44] see
[20:45] now that being the case then you begin
[20:48] to look at at how this grace is is given
[20:52] to us and then i can promise you that
[20:54] however you imagine and if you hit it
[20:57] right on the head and say okay it's
[20:59] coming by you know by going to church
[21:01] it's coming by hearing the preaching
[21:03] it's coming by playing tapes it's come
[21:04] by reading my bible it's coming by
[21:06] fellowship it's coming back by prayer
[21:08] it's all of the above yeah amen all of
[21:10] the above check box every one of those
[21:12] make sure you got a check box in every
[21:14] one of those
[21:15] because
[21:16] don't
[21:17] think the devil don't know how it's
[21:19] coming to you that's right see
[21:22] and so remember that that the enemy
[21:25] and knowing how it's coming to you is
[21:28] going to meet you right at that place in
[21:31] your mind to try to take you away from
[21:34] all of those check boxes because if you
[21:37] if you get drawn away from those check
[21:40] boxes
[21:41] then you're then that grace is going to
[21:42] be largely ineffective on your life and
[21:44] you might wonder why i don't not have
[21:46] more overcoming power i thought i had a
[21:49] grace coming at the revelation of jesus
[21:50] christ i don't know i've received it i
[21:52] believe it yeah but but how is it
[21:54] affected in your life it's affected by
[21:56] coming to church it's reflected by
[21:58] hearing the gospel it's affected by
[22:00] playing the tapes it's affected by
[22:01] reading your bible it's affected by
[22:03] prayer time fellowship time amen
[22:06] amen
[22:07] and so so when we look at these
[22:09] scriptures now
[22:10] first peter we read it all right look at
[22:12] it again wherefore gird up the loins of
[22:15] your mind be sober and hope to the end
[22:18] gird up the loins of your mind
[22:21] because this is how
[22:23] the grace coming

[24:06] gracious salvation that will come to you
[24:09] when jesus christ is revealed to the
[24:12] world see watch put all your hope there
[24:15] this is why i read those quotes where
[24:16] brother brad i'm talking about the
[24:18] insanity of the world and all
[24:19] civilization and government education
[24:21] everything's of the devil don't put your
[24:22] hope there
[24:23] we live there
[24:25] we function in that we have to have the
[24:28] functions of living i'm not saying let's
[24:29] go build a commune and let's live apart
[24:31] from the world no that's not even the
[24:33] commission jesus sent you in
[24:35] and sheep among wolves that's the
[24:37] commission of the church going to all
[24:39] the world in any condition i will be
[24:41] with you always
[24:43] see
[24:44] but you but there is an action here put
[24:47] all your hope in the gracious salvation
[24:49] that will come to you when jesus christ
[24:51] is revealed to the world look at here it
[24:53] is in the uh eugene peterson's message
[24:56] translation
[24:57] roll up your sleeves like that put your
[25:01] put your mind
[25:02] excuse me
[25:04] in gear
[25:05] be totally
[25:07] ready to receive the gift that's coming
[25:10] when jesus arrives amen i mean what good
[25:13] does it do me to bring you something
[25:16] you're not ready to receive it
[25:18] you have no preparation you know i i'm
[25:21] gonna bring you some great thing you
[25:22] don't even have a way to avail
[25:24] yourselves of it see so so the the
[25:27] apostle is saying hey you people of the
[25:29] end time it's going to be crazy out
[25:31] there
[25:32] you're going to need this grace good
[25:33] news don't panic breathe everybody calm
[25:35] down it's coming he's going to send it
[25:37] it's a special grace
[25:39] but you're going to have to be prepared
[25:41] to use it you're going to have to be
[25:44] prepared you can't use it very
[25:46] effectively if your whole life is caught
[25:48] up in everything that the antichrist
[25:51] controls right so you see its balance
[25:54] friends of course we work jobs and get
[25:56] education have careers of course we do
[25:58] nothing wrong with that whatsoever but
[26:01] but it's all about balance it's about
[26:03] you understanding who you are versus who
[26:06] the rest of everybody else is what your
[26:08] future is versus the other future i'm
[26:11] not saying we judge i i'm saying i do
[26:13] this i judge to make sure i'm in yeah
[26:16] amen i want to judge let a man examine
[26:18] himself
[26:19] and you know and and that he be not
[26:21] judged that's where i want to be today
[26:23] i'm not here i don't have no time to
[26:25] spend you know uh telling the world oh
[26:28] you're out too bad but i'm here to say
[26:31] i'm in and i can get you in if you'll
[26:34] just listen amen and so so we realize
[26:37] here that he says roll up your sleeves
[26:39] not many people want to do that today
[26:40] people don't want to work people don't
[26:42] want to labor they don't want to take
[26:43] the responsibility
[26:45] that it takes to have a spiritual home a
[26:48] spiritual life a spiritual family it's
[26:50] work on purpose it's that way see
[26:54] he says and i uh
[26:56] and i love how eugene peterson puts that
[26:58] in there a future in god if you're going
[27:01] to have a future in god here's the
[27:04] instruction manual amen
[27:06] roll up your sleeves how many want a
[27:08] future in god roll up your sleeves
[27:11] roll up your sleeves you want a future
[27:12] in god roll up your sleeves get ready to
[27:15] be totally ready to receive the gift
[27:18] that's coming finally this week's
[27:20] translation i love this one the best
[27:22] wherefore having put out of the way once
[27:26] for all everything that would impede the
[27:30] free action of your mind be calm and
[27:33] collected in spirit and set your hope
[27:35] perfectly holy and unchangeably without
[27:39] doubt and dependency upon the grace that
[27:42] is being brought to you upon the
[27:44] occasion of the revelation of jesus
[27:47] christ i absolutely love that
[27:51] wherefore
[27:52] having put out of the way this is past
[27:54] tense say brother jason i love the last
[27:58] part of that i love when it talks about
[28:00] the grace on this great occasion this
[28:03] revelation that's coming but he's and we
[28:06] all love that but the the precursor the
[28:09] the the prerequisite is
[28:12] having past tense put out of the way
[28:16] once and for all
[28:17] everything that would impede the free
[28:20] action of your mind so don't let the
[28:24] devil find his way into your life
[28:27] impeding what god wants to do with this
[28:30] grace in your life
[28:33] finally i want to read brother branham
[28:34] from the seventh seal
[28:37] he says i thank him for jesus christ
[28:40] for without sending him
[28:42] for the propitiation of our sins
[28:45] we'd all be a big muck of sin with no
[28:49] hope now how many can get off their high
[28:51] horse and say amen amen
[28:53] amen
[28:55] it requires you to look at that humbly
[28:58] we're going to read it again but you're
[29:00] going to have to be humble to accept it
[29:03] i thank him for jesus christ for without
[29:07] sending him for the propitiation of our
[29:09] sins
[29:10] we'd all everybody say all
[29:14] we'd all be in the big muck of sin with
[29:18] no hope
[29:19] but
[29:20] by whose grace
[29:22] his remember the grace to be given to
[29:25] you at the revelation of jesus christ
[29:28] see but by his grace
[29:30] his blood cleanses all sin just like the
[29:34] drop of ink in a bucket of clorox you'd
[29:36] never find the ink again when our sins
[29:39] are confessed it's put in the blood of
[29:41] jesus christ they'll never be known
[29:45] again amen
[29:47] god forgets them i didn't without a
[29:50] prophet i didn't know that was possible
[29:52] how does an omniscient god forget
[29:54] something
[29:55] see
[29:56] you know you know you know people say
[29:58] you know you hear the old saying people
[30:00] believe what they want to believe
[30:02] right
[30:03] well god forgets what he wants to forget
[30:06] amen
[30:07] so you just take comfort in that say why
[30:09] did he forget it because he wanted to
[30:11] because he because i don't like thinking
[30:12] of of of any negative thing in my
[30:15] children or my grandchildren i like just
[30:17] looking at them as perfect
[30:19] amen
[30:20] and and if they do something i'm i'm the
[30:22] first one to try to smooth it over and
[30:23] say oh well it's all right let's just
[30:25] press on and you're still perfect amen
[30:28] look at what he says god forgets them
[30:30] they never was even done
[30:34] now only god can do that because you
[30:36] can't even if you you can't even reverse
[30:38] time like that they they never was even
[30:40] done and as long as that sacrifice is
[30:43] laying there in an atonement for us then
[30:47] that's all that's it see we're not
[30:50] sinners no more we're christians by what
[30:53] the grace of god
[30:55] remember in our own selves we'd probably
[30:58] be just as bad as we ever was but see
[31:02] the grace of god has applied to us and
[31:05] that's what has made us what we are
[31:08] today christian brothers and sisters
[31:12] amen god bless you today we'll have our
[31:14] intermission and the regular service
[31:16] will start shortly god bless you
