[50:18] husband and I heard a great voice out of
[50:21] Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of
[50:25] God is with men and he will dwell with
[50:28] them and they shall be his people and
[50:31] God himself shall be with them and be
[50:34] their god let's
[50:38] pray Lord we thank you for your word
[50:41] tonight now father just as I read it I
[50:45] already feel the pulsation of the Holy
[50:47] Spirit Lord no wonder the Bible
[50:49] testifies of its own self that whosoever
[50:53] would read it there's a blessing in
[50:54] reading it there's even a blessing
[50:57] Lord in just hearing it read so father
[51:00] we're thanking you for that tonight now
[51:03] we've gathered Lord in the midweek here
[51:05] for our little midweek uh filp Lord we
[51:08] need a fresh surge of the Holy Spirit we
[51:11] need a fresh anointing upon the word of
[51:14] God lord we need something to give us
[51:16] strength and give us courage father to
[51:18] fight the fight of Faith to carry on
[51:21] Lord God I pray Lord that we not just

[51:36] predestinated to stand Lord

[51:46] completely to that thing which gives us
[51:49] all of our strength it is our whole hope
[51:51] and stay it is your word Lord you value
[51:54] your word above your own name the Bible
[51:56] teaches Jesus so we commit it to you now
[51:59] in Jesus name amen God bless you friends
[52:02] you can be seated we're going to
[52:03] continue
[52:06] reading verse
[52:08] four and God shall wipe away all tears
[52:14] from their eyes and there shall be no
[52:17] more death neither sorrow nor crying
[52:21] neither shall there be any more pain for
[52:24] the former Things Are are passed away
[52:28] and he that sat upon the throne said now
[52:31] that's the one you can put your
[52:33] confidence in the one seated on the
[52:35] throne behold I make all things new now
[52:41] since the one on the throne said it you
[52:45] can Bank on it because he don't change
[52:48] his mind and nobody can stop
[52:52] him Hallelujah so he says I
[52:57] and he that sat upon the throne said
[53:00] behold I make all things new and he said
[53:02] unto me right for these words are true
[53:06] and faithful I think it's a pretty
[53:08] amazing deal that the Lord is offering
[53:11] us you know I I years ago many years ago
[53:14] I had a friend uh from back in the day
[53:17] probably almost 30 years ago don't even
[53:19] know if he's still living he was he was
[53:21] uh senior to me so I don't even haven't
[53:23] heard from him in a long time may have
[53:26] uh went on he he was a wonderful
[53:28] Christian man and couldn't quite see you
[53:31] know the word of God as we see it but I
[53:34] could sense in him a real love for the
[53:37] Savior and uh I'm going to tell you
[53:39] something friends that's what the Lord
[53:40] will be looking for on that day when
[53:42] when those who are granted eternal life
[53:46] you know we already know they they
[53:48] didn't they didn't receive the message
[53:50] because that's why they went through a
[53:51] tribulation said well you know they
[53:53] should have went to the Judgment they
[53:55] did they went went through the
[53:56] tribulation period and then they came to
[53:58] the Judgment bar and they were granted
[54:01] eternal life and he had a sign that
[54:04] always admired in his office when I was
[54:06] there and he did bookkeeping for me
[54:08] bookkeeping for the church and uh the
[54:11] sign had a picture of the Lord Jesus and
[54:14] it's it's the Lord saying to the to
[54:17] whoever is reading and saying I never
[54:21] told you it would be
[54:23] easy I only told you it would be worth
[54:27] it and every time I would come into
[54:30] Robert's office I would just stare at
[54:32] that sign I would say yes Lord oh I
[54:35] don't want it easy I don't need it easy
[54:36] it wasn't easy for him it wasn't easy
[54:39] for the Saints of old I'm not looking
[54:41] for Easy Street or a flowery bed of ease
[54:44] friends I'd like to know that I made it
[54:47] through and I fought my way and I saw
[54:50] the enemy put down and I saw the Lord
[54:52] Jesus lifted up I've often thought I'd
[54:55] like that to be my last breath in this
[54:57] world is calling Satan a liar and Jesus
[55:01] true Hallelujah and so I'd like to agree
[55:05] with these words his words are true and
[55:07] faithful and so you've got this one
[55:10] seated on the throne that's that's
[55:13] laying out a case here that I would just
[55:15] say it ought to be a a deal you can't
[55:19] refuse because I mean he's going to wipe
[55:21] away all tears there's going to be no
[55:25] more death there's going to be no more
[55:27] sorrow there's going to be no more
[55:29] crying there's going to be no more
[55:33] pain the former things are passed
[55:36] away and oh boy I wish that was true
[55:40] tonight I wish that a lot of my former
[55:41] things were just passed away but he's
[55:44] saying they're going to be passed away
[55:46] and all things are going to be made
[55:51] new now we found the echo of that in
[55:54] Isaiah 65
[55:56] where he said the former shall not be
[55:59] remember remembered you you you recall
[56:01] that we read that in our text on Sunday
[56:04] Isaiah 65:17 and 18 behold I created new
[56:08] heavens and a new Earth and the former
[56:10] things the former shall not be
[56:12] remembered nor come into mine I love
[56:14] that we had quite a bit to say about
[56:16] that and I still feel it reverberating
[56:18] in my soul this evening be but be ye
[56:22] glad and rejoice forever in that which I
[56:28] create could I say to you tonight in the
[56:32] words of this highly esteemed Prophet be
[56:35] glad and
[56:37] rejoice be glad I know the world is
[56:41] tough I know there's problems I know
[56:43] there's the devil I know we got issues
[56:45] but be glad and rejoice forever in that
[56:50] which I create for behold I create
[56:53] Jerusalem a rejoicing in her people
[56:58] Joy is coming a
[57:01] painfree
[57:05] world
[57:09] dismissed let's just go out in the
[57:11] churchyard and Shout a while and people
[57:13] drive by and say what are y'all what's
[57:15] y'all's problem well we got a lot of
[57:17] problems now but we're headed the reason
[57:19] we're shouting is because we're headed
[57:20] for a painfree
[57:22] world not only will you no longer feel
[57:25] the pain of traumas past traumas how
[57:27] many got them past trials traumas and
[57:31] trials and past failures
[57:35] and and all your
[57:38] losses I've had some pretty epic losses
[57:41] friends but I'm here to tell you that
[57:43] all of those former
[57:47] things they're going to be unremembered
[57:51] because they won't even come back to my
[57:53] mind
[57:57] you're like me life can give you many
[57:59] regrets and painful memories some of you
[58:02] young people don't know a whole lot
[58:04] about that yet although I imagine it
[58:06] doesn't take too long to get them piling
[58:08] up by the time you get some years on you
[58:11] life has given you a lot of regrets and
[58:13] a lot of painful memories that come on
[58:17] let's be honest we'd really like to get
[58:18] them out of our
[58:20] mind I mean let's just tell the truth
[58:23] we'd like to get them out of our mind we
[58:25] so wish wish that we could undo them
[58:28] well there they won't
[58:33] exist Hallelujah that world will be
[58:37] filled with all that I ever loved and
[58:41] all that ever loved me that can't be for
[58:44] just one man because the Bible says I
[58:48] create Jerusalem a rejoicing and her
[58:51] people a
[58:53] joy Hallelujah
[58:57] brother brandham let me have my
[58:58] PowerPoint brother Josh brother brandham
[59:01] carries on here in the message I uh I I
[59:04] I congratulate any who did some homework
[59:07] and got this message out I had some
[59:09] people writing me from overseas saying
[59:11] okay you talk me into it I'm going to
[59:13] listen to Future home again amen praise
[59:16] the Lord oh let's see I think I'm on are
[59:18] we up and running oh there we go
[59:20] beautiful all right so a brand new book
[59:23] part two
[59:26] look at that subtitle that's weird isn't
[59:27] it not a
[59:30] simulation that's conspiracy
[59:36] theory this is not a
[59:39] simulation but it is a
[59:43] shadow I'm not going to say a whole lot
[59:45] about that tonight we're gonna have some
[59:49] of this for Sunday it looks like we are
[59:52] not in a
[59:53] simulation this is real
[59:56] but it is a
[59:58] shadow so there is something far more
[1:00:01] real say man the regrets I got I don't
[1:00:05] see how changing location you're going
[1:00:08] to leave this
[1:00:09] existence just understand that every
[1:00:12] regret every loss every failure is in a
[1:00:15] shadow and it won't exist in a positive
[1:00:20] Hallelujah
[1:00:21] my brother Brandon is goes on here to
[1:00:25] say and I'm not going to say a whole lot
[1:00:26] more about that but you know there's um
[1:00:29] there there brother brandham said some
[1:00:31] fascinating things uh about that and I
[1:00:35] I'm not I'm trying to resist not going
[1:00:37] down that path tonight but you know the
[1:00:41] I can just I will just give you just a
[1:00:43] little teaser that
[1:00:46] science on The Cutting Edge we're
[1:00:49] talking about we're not just talking we
[1:00:51] are talking about Einstein's theory of
[1:00:53] general relativity including his theory
[1:00:56] of special relativity which is different
[1:00:59] which is further including String Theory
[1:01:01] including super String Theory including
[1:01:05] brain
[1:01:06] Theory there's all kinds of Cutting Edge
[1:01:09] scientific theories that if they would
[1:01:11] have just took a Kentucky Hillbilly's
[1:01:14] word of how he explained it it wouldn't
[1:01:16] be Theory anymore it' be scientific law
[1:01:19] and they would understand but they're
[1:01:21] too prideful I'm glad God gave me a
[1:01:24] perfect Faith to believe in a perfect
[1:01:26] promise and you're going to see that all
[1:01:28] of those theories recognize
[1:01:31] multi-dimensional levels now they've got
[1:01:33] it all wrong they some of them got five
[1:01:36] Dimensions some of them need 10 some of
[1:01:38] them strength Theory needs 10 11 and uh
[1:01:40] you know and there's all kinds of
[1:01:42] different ones but but but we know that
[1:01:44] there are other dimensions and and and
[1:01:47] and I'm not going to go any further than
[1:01:48] that all right so brother brandham says
[1:01:51] here now here here was our scripture
[1:01:53] from Isaiah we've already read that okay
[1:01:55] brother Brandon picks up here paragraph
[1:01:58] 101 now the reason I've got these quotes
[1:02:00] on here is because they're lengthy and
[1:02:02] then I got some a few other shorter
[1:02:04] quotes that are not up here because I
[1:02:06] want to give you a little bit of of
[1:02:07] change up all right so let's read along
[1:02:10] here you're going to see some of the
[1:02:12] things that we've been teaching from now
[1:02:15] he's called The Church through
[1:02:16] justification called it through
[1:02:19] sanctification then filled it with the
[1:02:21] Holy Ghost and Fire and he took it
[1:02:23] through a process that he himself self
[1:02:26] the Holy Spirit himself the Son of God
[1:02:28] could dwell in the human heart now it
[1:02:31] has got to go through that before he can
[1:02:34] come uh into it so here is where we were
[1:02:37] on Sunday where brother brandham is
[1:02:40] showing that he puts you through the
[1:02:43] same thing he puts the Earth he puts the
[1:02:45] Earth through the same thing he puts you
[1:02:48] and incidentally may I say he himself
[1:02:50] went
[1:02:51] through he went through the exact same
[1:02:54] things you understand when the Holy
[1:02:56] Ghost came upon him in the water he
[1:02:58] didn't need to be born again but he he
[1:03:00] did get an empowerment for his ministry
[1:03:03] it wasn't for a new birth like you
[1:03:04] you're born in sin you need a new birth
[1:03:06] and you need an anointing upon you to go
[1:03:09] forward in faith and power and I'm here
[1:03:11] to tell you there's power in the Holy
[1:03:15] Ghost see because you're still in a
[1:03:18] you're you're still trapped you know uh
[1:03:21] uh in in in a body that is so uh
[1:03:24] unbelievably weak now Christ of course
[1:03:27] at the same time was in every way
[1:03:30] temptable the difference between he and
[1:03:33] you is that he never even one time
[1:03:37] failed to always do that which pleases
[1:03:40] the father now there's no one who could
[1:03:44] have pulled that off except God
[1:03:47] himself which is the only proof I need
[1:03:50] that Jesus wasn't a second person he was
[1:03:53] the person cuz no human could have done
[1:03:56] what he' done unless he was more than a
[1:03:59] man he was a God man
[1:04:03] see so he says he says all right now it
[1:04:06] has to go through that before he can
[1:04:10] come into it notice he done the world uh
[1:04:15] notice he done the world where that
[1:04:18] bride the world excuse me notice he done
[1:04:21] the world where that bride is going to
[1:04:24] live in the same way his same Plan of
[1:04:27] Salvation notice the anad deluvian world
[1:04:30] after he after it had repented by
[1:04:33] through the Bride of that day Noah catch
[1:04:36] it now it repented through
[1:04:40] Noah so so Noah's life the Earth got
[1:04:45] credit for its
[1:04:46] justification because sons of God lived
[1:04:50] for
[1:04:53] God so surely you wouldn't go away now
[1:04:58] thinking all this is just
[1:05:01] rules this is so far beyond rules and rs
[1:05:06] this is a manifestation of a literal
[1:05:09] life that created it all and is now
[1:05:11] living inside of his family living
[1:05:13] through
[1:05:14] them it's far more than just that's why
[1:05:18] denominationalism is worthless because
[1:05:21] all it is is is just it just puts you in
[1:05:23] a box and makes you a box Christian
[1:05:27] see and it doesn't even have the box
[1:05:31] right so he says it by through the Bride
[1:05:35] of that day Noah he gave it a water
[1:05:37] baptism covered it over with water then
[1:05:43] justification showing that he's on his
[1:05:46] road to call this Fallen World from Eden
[1:05:49] back to its restoration again then
[1:05:53] Christ came and shed his blood upon it
[1:05:55] cleansing it and claiming it see that's
[1:05:58] the world that we live in
[1:06:00] now see how
[1:06:04] Satan watch this now see how Satan here
[1:06:08] in the scripture tried to make him break
[1:06:12] God's plan now he's talking about Jesus
[1:06:14] in the
[1:06:16] wilderness he the spirit of God comes on
[1:06:19] him in the water this is my beloved Son
[1:06:21] in whom I'm pleased to dwell immediately
[1:06:23] he goes into the wilderness to receive
[1:06:26] his fiery trials and you know there's
[1:06:29] where brother brandham says him and Dr
[1:06:31] Davis always debated over you know that
[1:06:34] the fact that after John baptized Jesus
[1:06:38] then Dr Davis said then Jesus turned
[1:06:40] around and baptized John and brother
[1:06:43] brandham says no he didn't do that
[1:06:45] brother Roy he did not do that John
[1:06:48] baptized him and the spirit Came Upon
[1:06:50] him and he straightway went up out of
[1:06:52] the water and he said you know in the
[1:06:54] whole debate is Billy you know you just
[1:06:56] don't know your Bible and your uh um Dr
[1:06:59] Smith tried to tell him the same thing
[1:07:01] he said well I know the author real well
[1:07:04] and I mean they those doctors of
[1:07:05] divinity got every way they want to
[1:07:07] prove it till finally a prophet just
[1:07:09] just put it on the brass tax and he said
[1:07:12] one time in another place he said I know
[1:07:14] he didn't do that because he stood me
[1:07:16] there on the bank and I watched it take
[1:07:18] place and he said he came straight up
[1:07:20] out of the water and the spirit of God
[1:07:22] descended on him and he went straight
[1:07:23] into the Wilderness I'm here to tell you
[1:07:25] something friends you got in insider
[1:07:28] trading
[1:07:31] understanding see so he
[1:07:35] says says not now he says um see how
[1:07:39] Satan here in the scripture tried to
[1:07:44] make him break God's plan to receive it
[1:07:48] give it to him when he took him up on
[1:07:50] the mountain and tried to give it to him
[1:07:52] without the purchase of the blood Satan
[1:07:55] you know said well if these Stones
[1:07:57] you're hungry which he was turn them
[1:07:59] into into bread and I you know the other
[1:08:04] day I was uh at at at at brother Chris's
[1:08:07] and and we were we have a Tuesday
[1:08:09] Morning Bible study there with his crew
[1:08:11] and I was just I took the a thought some
[1:08:15] week or two ago and I said you know when
[1:08:17] Jesus went into the Wilderness you know
[1:08:20] he left his guns in the ranch
[1:08:22] house he left all his weapons on the
[1:08:25] table
[1:08:26] he went into the Wilderness unarmed
[1:08:29] except with the word brother brandham
[1:08:31] said now he had great power he could
[1:08:33] have turned those stones into bread but
[1:08:35] he didn't want to use his great power he
[1:08:38] because he was showing a road map for
[1:08:40] you and I he was giving us the way
[1:08:43] forward so that it when it would be your
[1:08:45] turn to be the word made flesh you'd
[1:08:47] know how to beat the devil and you
[1:08:50] wouldn't need the kind of power he had
[1:08:52] access to cuz you've got the same thing
[1:08:54] he's got but you've only got a spoonful
[1:08:56] of it he was the whole fullness of the
[1:08:58] godhead bodily he could have spoke the
[1:09:01] devil out of existence had it served his
[1:09:03] purpose right then the devil jumping up
[1:09:06] thinking he's somebody and his very life
[1:09:08] is sustained by
[1:09:11] God think about it friends the world
[1:09:14] thinks they're in control they're in
[1:09:15] control of
[1:09:17] nothing and all of history has been not
[1:09:21] only not only uh not only has has
[1:09:24] prophecy been the Catalyst of all
[1:09:26] history but it's been the sustainer of
[1:09:28] all history it's been the controller of
[1:09:30] all history he's got his foot on the
[1:09:32] throttle and on the break and he puts it
[1:09:35] in park or he pulls it in drive and me
[1:09:38] the best laid plans of mice and men mean
[1:09:41] nothing to God why do you fear Him
[1:09:44] friends your heavenly father has got the
[1:09:46] whole plan under his under his control
[1:09:50] under his
[1:09:52] domain your heavenly father
[1:09:55] news flash is
[1:10:03] God but now Satan wants to give him a
[1:10:07] shortcut you
[1:10:09] know showed him all the kingdoms of the
[1:10:12] world showed him America brother B say
[1:10:15] showed him America showed him Russia
[1:10:16] showed him everything showed him all the
[1:10:18] future all the kingdoms that would ever
[1:10:20] be and said they're mine and Jesus
[1:10:23] didn't argue because the whole world
[1:10:25] been Fallen it's all bro the whole thing
[1:10:26] was broken and Satan had Dominion of it
[1:10:29] Adam lost it lost control of
[1:10:31] it and Satan is now controlling it the
[1:10:34] only thing he can't get his hands on is
[1:10:36] that book of life he tried but brother
[1:10:38] Brenham said his Filthy Hands couldn't
[1:10:39] hold it and it went back to the original
[1:10:42] thank God the book with my name is safe
[1:10:46] in The Throne Room of almighty God and
[1:10:49] Satan can't get near it wo hallelujah
[1:10:54] hallelujah
[1:10:55] oh
[1:10:57] my and so he says I'll give them to you
[1:11:01] all you got to do is worship
[1:11:03] me and see brother brandham says he's
[1:11:06] trying to give he here in the scripture
[1:11:09] trying to make him break God's plan to
[1:11:12] receive it give it to him oh you know
[1:11:15] when he took him up on the mountain and
[1:11:16] tried to give it to him without the
[1:11:18] purchase of blood now watch him go back
[1:11:21] and pick up the father of the faith and
[1:11:23] Abraham's going to show the type he says
[1:11:25] did you notice how Abraham when they
[1:11:29] tried to give him the land he bought it
[1:11:33] with so many shekel of silver before the
[1:11:37] people as an insign as a witness let it
[1:11:40] be known this day that I bought this
[1:11:44] burying Place see purchase it and Satan
[1:11:47] tried to give him the kingdom which
[1:11:49] belongs to him now he tried to give it
[1:11:52] to him as a gift but he wouldn't receive
[1:11:55] receive
[1:11:57] it cuz it's see watch then Satan could
[1:12:02] still have a claim on
[1:12:05] it now a rightful claim is a legal
[1:12:11] problem if somebody's got a legal claim
[1:12:15] you got a title you own some property
[1:12:18] but that thing somebody's got a legal
[1:12:20] claim against that you got a house you
[1:12:22] got a building and somebody has filed a
[1:12:24] legal claim
[1:12:25] and that then that's got to go to court
[1:12:27] and that's got to a decision's got to be
[1:12:29] made so he's saying here if if he could
[1:12:32] have Talk Jesus into that then Satan
[1:12:35] could still have a claim on I'm so glad
[1:12:38] he didn't do it so glad he didn't take
[1:12:41] the bait I'm so glad he didn't try to
[1:12:44] avoid pain and sorrow and
[1:12:48] crucifixion Hallelujah
[1:12:51] see so he says
[1:12:55] amen he says he had had a claim on it
[1:12:57] but it had to be bought amen he was the
[1:13:02] word in the fullness thereof they
[1:13:04] couldn't deceive him into it thank God
[1:13:08] boy they might could have tricked me but
[1:13:10] they couldn't deceive him into it
[1:13:13] then then it it is now to get a baptism
[1:13:17] of fire see it has now what happened he
[1:13:22] says Christ came and called The Church
[1:13:25] Church to
[1:13:26] repentance uh in the name of Jesus
[1:13:29] Christ for the remission sanctify the
[1:13:31] church and with the fire of God come
[1:13:34] down and burn out all the filth and come
[1:13:37] and dwells in the human
[1:13:39] heart now the world to be redeemed for
[1:13:44] this redeemed person he uses the same he
[1:13:47] uses his same method you understand it's
[1:13:51] his method to come down and burn it out
[1:13:54] of you is his method to come down and
[1:13:58] Destroy old friendships and wreck old
[1:14:01] relationships that's him you understand
[1:14:05] to put you on a different course and
[1:14:07] maybe upend and you might have a a
[1:14:09] tremendous investment in a certain
[1:14:12] course of life and God has come down and
[1:14:14] flipped the whole script and you're now
[1:14:17] moving away from everything you sunk so
[1:14:20] much into and now but I'm here to tell
[1:14:22] you five minutes into his way is worth
[1:14:25] more than 50 years in the wrong
[1:14:30] way he baptized it with
[1:14:33] water after the anad deluvian
[1:14:36] destruction shed his blood upon it to
[1:14:38] sanctify it and claim it it's his Satan
[1:14:42] tried to say I'll give it to you he said
[1:14:43] no sir I'll buy it Let It Be A Witness
[1:14:48] he was lifted up for an ins sign and he
[1:14:52] bought
[1:14:53] it he Pur purchased
[1:14:56] it you say it's his
[1:15:00] true but what's his is
[1:15:03] mine if you don't believe what a hus
[1:15:06] what that everything a husband has
[1:15:07] belongs to the wife ask sister
[1:15:12] debie I'll promise you Brothers
[1:15:14] everything you got belongs to her
[1:15:17] Hallelujah thankfully everything that's
[1:15:19] hers is mine also this whole thing is a
[1:15:21] love affair that's why a marriage
[1:15:24] depicts Christ in his bride so it is his
[1:15:27] he bought it but it's mine because it's
[1:15:29] his so how did it become yours when it
[1:15:32] was his cuz I'm
[1:15:33] his Hallelujah the devil hates that and
[1:15:37] I'm glad he hates it I want to say it
[1:15:39] again he bought it and I own it
[1:15:42] Hallelujah I have legal rights to it I'm
[1:15:46] not just claiming it it's not just a a
[1:15:49] word salad I'm not just offering a
[1:15:51] cliche I own eternal life
[1:15:59] Hallelujah but now
[1:16:02] watch but now it has to go through a
[1:16:05] baptism of fire Holy Fire from God which
[1:16:09] cleanses the earth and the heavens
[1:16:11] around it then it's purchased so that
[1:16:13] the redeemed can live on it live in it
[1:16:17] in
[1:16:18] peace notice the baptism of fire is to
[1:16:23] cleanse it from sin from sickness from
[1:16:26] disease germs from sinners from the
[1:16:30] devil and all his group he's to be cast
[1:16:35] out into the Lake of
[1:16:38] Fire you want peace in your
[1:16:41] life takes
[1:16:43] fire that's an odd way of getting to
[1:16:46] peace well it's not just getting you to
[1:16:49] a peace it's getting you to the peace
[1:16:53] and the difference between a piece and
[1:16:56] the piece is a piece comes and goes and
[1:17:01] it depends on how good you feel and how
[1:17:03] well people are treating you and how
[1:17:05] many zeros are in your bank account and
[1:17:06] as your car running all right soon as
[1:17:09] those things collapse you ain't got a
[1:17:10] whole lot of peace I'm here to tell you
[1:17:13] that there's a peace that passes
[1:17:15] understanding that the worse it gets the
[1:17:17] more peace you have you're an enigma
[1:17:20] you're an anomaly the devil can't figure
[1:17:22] out the harder he makes it on you the
[1:17:24] more love God and believe his
[1:17:27] word
[1:17:29] see so he
[1:17:32] says all right so so so here all right
[1:17:35] so it has to go to the Lake of Fire okay
[1:17:36] we got that one Holy Fire from
[1:17:41] God comes down from God out of
[1:17:45] Heaven Burns it up notice to make it
[1:17:49] ready for God to dwell
[1:17:51] in for God in the new world that is to
[1:17:54] come
[1:17:55] is to dwell in the Earth because you say
[1:17:57] God he dwells in the human heart but he
[1:17:59] and his bride becomes one and they go to
[1:18:02] their home in the new world this is
[1:18:07] poetry and the same Plan of
[1:18:11] Redemption is used to redeem both world
[1:18:15] and the persons that live in it see the
[1:18:20] heart has to be cleansed like that
[1:18:23] before God can come down in the person
[1:18:25] of the Holy Ghost which is Christ coming
[1:18:28] down and dwell in the human heart it
[1:18:31] first must be repented see it's got to
[1:18:33] be cleansed he's not going to live
[1:18:36] inside this is where where brother
[1:18:38] Brandon would constantly say to those
[1:18:40] Pentecostal women and he says you get
[1:18:43] out there in the front yard and you're
[1:18:44] half naked just so men can see you and
[1:18:47] lust after you and you claim you got the
[1:18:49] holy spirit said I'll remind you sister
[1:18:51] he's a holy spirit not a filthy spirit
[1:18:56] so there no way to make that claim
[1:18:59] there's no way to claim you have the
[1:19:03] Holy Spirit and not living
[1:19:07] holy I don't deny you've got a
[1:19:11] spirit but it ain't the Holy
[1:19:15] Spirit certainly not anointing you when
[1:19:17] you do stuff like that not even saying
[1:19:20] you don't love God but as I've said to
[1:19:22] you and taught you there's a big
[1:19:24] difference there's a Grand Canyon siiz
[1:19:27] difference between having a love for God
[1:19:29] and having the love of
[1:19:31] God the love of God is the person of God
[1:19:35] living down inside
[1:19:38] you all right so he says um all right so
[1:19:43] here we
[1:19:44] go it must be baptized in water in the
[1:19:49] his name to show who it belongs to then
[1:19:53] it must be
[1:19:55] cleansed by the blood of
[1:19:59] Jesus and then the Holy Fire and holy
[1:20:02] ghost from God come down and burns out
[1:20:05] all the desire of sin all the nature of
[1:20:09] the world and therefore see now watch
[1:20:13] and therefore he that sins willfully
[1:20:16] after receiving the knowledge of the
[1:20:18] truth then again the Bible said it's
[1:20:21] impossible for a man that's born of God
[1:20:24] for man that's born of God cannot sin he
[1:20:26] does not sin there's no way for him to
[1:20:28] sin how can he be a sinner and and a
[1:20:32] redeemed at the same time so brother
[1:20:35] Brandon is saying th this would create a
[1:20:37] conundrum if you don't understand the
[1:20:39] meaning of it so you know if you it it
[1:20:43] once once you realize what real Sin is
[1:20:46] is
[1:20:47] unbelief it's not in brother Brandon I
[1:20:49] just heard him today sister Debbie
[1:20:50] playing a tape through the house and as
[1:20:52] I come through and he's he's talking
[1:20:54] talking about you know I was saying I
[1:20:56] was saying you know drinking's not sin
[1:20:58] adulter is's not sin gambling's not sin
[1:21:00] all these things are not sin and he said
[1:21:03] there was one poor old black sister
[1:21:06] there he said she had about all she
[1:21:08] could take and said she got to her feet
[1:21:10] and said brother Brandon pray tell what
[1:21:12] is sin
[1:21:13] then he was happy she did it he said
[1:21:16] it's unbelief you do those things cuz
[1:21:19] you're not converted see the desire of
[1:21:22] the world is still in you and so that is
[1:21:24] still a habit of your life see all right
[1:21:28] so
[1:21:30] um all right so how can I be in the pawn
[1:21:34] shop here's a legit question how can I
[1:21:37] be in the pawn shop and out of the pawn
[1:21:40] shop at the same time see oh he redeemed
[1:21:43] Us by his blood his Spirit he cleansed
[1:21:46] us and then comes to dwell in us the
[1:21:50] church not the denomination now the
[1:21:53] church
[1:21:55] all right so now I'm going to take that
[1:22:00] down and I'm going to give you some
[1:22:01] pieces of some other stuff he says he
[1:22:03] goes on in this same message and then
[1:22:05] I've got a different one from a
[1:22:06] different message and I'll let you know
[1:22:08] when we make the transition back and
[1:22:10] forth so in case you put it down in your
[1:22:13] notes so brother brandham begins he goes
[1:22:16] on down in this future home and he's
[1:22:19] talking about he picks up the narration
[1:22:20] of John saying I saw a holy city New
[1:22:23] Jerusalem descending Out of Heaven
[1:22:24] heaven and it was as a bride adorned for
[1:22:27] her husband so so everything about the
[1:22:30] city is is working in the bride you see
[1:22:35] how in Congress it is for people to
[1:22:40] imagine that they're not like him but
[1:22:43] they'll go to that city the whole city
[1:22:46] and them are operating on the same thing
[1:22:49] he's doing he's doing the Earth the city
[1:22:52] the bride his family Jes Jesus himself
[1:22:55] it all has to come through water blood
[1:22:58] and spirit it all has to come through
[1:23:00] justification and sanctification and the
[1:23:03] baptism of the Holy Ghost and you can't
[1:23:05] end around or short circuit or Bypass or
[1:23:08] step over any of those
[1:23:11] pieces see so the the world tries to do
[1:23:15] that but they're going to get a rude
[1:23:18] awakening so he says he's asking the
[1:23:21] question now where did John see the city
[1:23:24] on he says just exactly like it did upon
[1:23:29] the Earth Jesus was part of the earth
[1:23:32] that the Holy Ghost descended upon right
[1:23:34] Jesus his body so that that's why
[1:23:38] brother Brandon would paraphrase the
[1:23:40] scripture as only a prophet has
[1:23:42] authority to do at that level and where
[1:23:45] he says that you know you read in in
[1:23:47] your Bible and it says the the the
[1:23:50] spirit of God descended like a dove and
[1:23:52] a voice spoke and said this is my
[1:23:54] beloved son in whom I'm well pleased and
[1:23:57] brother brandham said the spirit of God
[1:24:00] descended like a dove and
[1:24:03] said this speaking of Jesus this man his
[1:24:08] body made out of the dust made out of
[1:24:10] the
[1:24:11] Earth this is my part of the earth this
[1:24:15] is God saying that this you got your
[1:24:18] part you're living in it that's your
[1:24:20] part of the earth said well I'm going to
[1:24:22] shed it one of these days well you're
[1:24:23] going to pick it back up every element
[1:24:24] that you are it's just going to be
[1:24:26] glorified it's going to go from Shadow
[1:24:28] to from a negative to a positive from
[1:24:31] Shadow to real it the the shadow only
[1:24:34] looks real because you're part of the
[1:24:36] Shadow you're in the shadow looking at
[1:24:39] the shadow so it seems real and it is a
[1:24:41] certain it is real we're not in a
[1:24:44] simulation it is real but I'm here to
[1:24:47] tell you there's a greater
[1:24:49] real and you've got your part of the
[1:24:51] earth and Jes and God was saying now you
[1:24:53] now here's my part of the earth that
[1:24:56] you're going to walk around my heaven in
[1:24:58] your part of the earth and I'm going to
[1:24:59] Walk Around Heaven in my part of the
[1:25:01] earth and this is my part of the earth
[1:25:03] and I've come to claim it and I'm going
[1:25:05] to start with this part of the earth and
[1:25:08] with this part of the earth I'm going to
[1:25:09] claim all the rest of the earth and all
[1:25:12] the other bodies and parts of my family
[1:25:14] that came out of the Earth or will come
[1:25:16] out of the earth that's you and me today
[1:25:19] I'm here to tell you when he came down
[1:25:21] to bring the spirit of God on Jesus he
[1:25:24] wasn't just thinking about Jesus he was
[1:25:27] thinking about Mrs Jesus Hallelujah you
[1:25:31] you you say I'm a Christian today you've
[1:25:33] been you've been in the works to be a
[1:25:35] Christian for thousands of
[1:25:38] years God already knew you were coming
[1:25:41] and already knew you would be a
[1:25:44] believer you can't not be a believer
[1:25:48] you're part of the same
[1:25:52] word so he so you see how he's he's
[1:25:55] tying it all together the Earth your
[1:25:57] body the New Jerusalem it's all the same
[1:26:00] thing see so so this is why this is why
[1:26:04] brother Brandon would say now this is
[1:26:06] the holy spirit in word
[1:26:09] form I thought the Holy Spirit was a
[1:26:12] person this is him in word
[1:26:14] form see so so now you you you you come
[1:26:19] and say well who was Jesus he was the
[1:26:21] Holy Spirit in human
[1:26:22] form see so where's now he's the holy
[1:26:25] spirit in Bride form you understand so
[1:26:29] so he
[1:26:30] says and It Came Upon him it descended
[1:26:33] and it remained upon him forever it
[1:26:35] could never leave him he and God are one
[1:26:38] always has to remain so John saw the
[1:26:41] holy city New Jerusalem descending like
[1:26:43] a comet or a dove down out of Heaven
[1:26:46] settling Upon A redeemed entire Earth to
[1:26:49] do
[1:26:51] what to claim Every Act
[1:26:54] attribute that he had made the Earth
[1:26:59] for and you're like brother Jason is he
[1:27:03] talking about
[1:27:05] people every man that was represented in
[1:27:09] the eternity and every woman is redeemed
[1:27:14] then she's been scoured and burned by
[1:27:17] fire Jesus in his fiery Temptation in
[1:27:20] the wilderness for 40 days after that
[1:27:23] notice it was ready for his ministry
[1:27:26] that's why you're ready for your
[1:27:28] ministry because you now have the Living
[1:27:30] Word of God it's a living bread it's a
[1:27:33] living reality hallelujah it's not no
[1:27:37] wonder organized religion can't do it no
[1:27:39] wonder denominationalism can't do that
[1:27:42] it can't produce that see so just as
[1:27:47] Jesus loved the father's Plan of
[1:27:50] Redemption in the word he loved it far
[1:27:53] too much to let Satan give him a
[1:27:56] shortcut I'm
[1:27:58] glad just as he loves the Earth that he
[1:28:01] created brother brandham goes on to talk
[1:28:03] about how that the whole reason of
[1:28:07] John's vision is because now there's
[1:28:09] been a
[1:28:10] millennium and a millennium has gone on
[1:28:13] for a thousand years but he brother
[1:28:16] brandham says there's he's not going to
[1:28:19] leave
[1:28:19] it in in the in the Millennium because
[1:28:23] the poor O Earth is still stuck in
[1:28:28] time it's still stuck in time excuse me
[1:28:31] but I don't really want to go to heaven
[1:28:33] at this age I'd like to be back like my
[1:28:36] grandkids
[1:28:38] again I want a new body I want a new
[1:28:41] Heaven the Earth is old like a garment
[1:28:43] but I'm here to tell you it's going to
[1:28:44] get a complete
[1:28:46] makeover Hallelujah the the Earth's
[1:28:49] Crush brother bom talks about the
[1:28:50] Earth's Crush for hundreds of miles will
[1:28:52] explode out the there's going to be
[1:28:54] fresh virgin soil Hallelujah friends
[1:28:57] going to be a new atmosphere that goes
[1:28:59] all the way up to that new city
[1:29:02] hallelujah oh
[1:29:05] my so he loves it too
[1:29:07] much to Le you know the Earth that he
[1:29:11] created he's not going to leave it
[1:29:13] Trapped In Time Forever in the seventh
[1:29:17] day now he he loves you too
[1:29:21] much see he loved the father's word too
[1:29:24] much to take a
[1:29:28] shortcut if he you're going to see how
[1:29:31] imp Peril you'd be here in a minute see
[1:29:35] he loved the the father's word of
[1:29:37] redemption he loved the whole notion of
[1:29:39] redemption too much Bible said he'll see
[1:29:42] his seed and be satisfied he loved that
[1:29:46] Vision far more than he dreaded his
[1:29:50] suffering
[1:29:52] amen so you know just like golden my ear
[1:29:55] said of the of the uh
[1:29:59] radical people who who have assaulted
[1:30:03] them since they became a nation and she
[1:30:06] says I she says the I think she uses the
[1:30:09] word Arab or Palestinian I can't
[1:30:10] remember which is such a political
[1:30:13] upside down bunch of nonsense she
[1:30:15] herself was and could prove she was a
[1:30:17] Palestinian go to my hair she said this
[1:30:20] whole nonsense like the Palestinian are
[1:30:22] different people she said I'm a
[1:30:25] Palestinian and so so she says when the
[1:30:29] Palestinians or when the Arabs I don't
[1:30:31] remember specifically she said when they
[1:30:34] love she she said they they say we kill
[1:30:37] their children we we loathe killing
[1:30:40] their children we only we kill their
[1:30:43] children because they're trying to kill
[1:30:45] us and the parents are trying to kill us
[1:30:48] and said I'll tell you when she said
[1:30:49] I'll tell you when you have peace said
[1:30:51] it to a reporter she said when they love
[1:30:53] their children more than they hate us
[1:30:56] we'll have
[1:30:57] peace when they love their children more
[1:31:00] than they hate us we'll have
[1:31:02] peace so he loves you too much to take a
[1:31:06] shortcut he loved God's Plan of
[1:31:08] Redemption he loved the Earth too much
[1:31:11] to leave it trapped in time and he loves
[1:31:15] you he he he loved us too much to take a
[1:31:17] short cut to the kingdom uh to the
[1:31:20] kingdom of Christ without the baptism of
[1:31:23] the Holy Ghost listen friends let me say
[1:31:25] it like this in plain language he loves
[1:31:28] you too much to let you go to heaven
[1:31:31] without the Holy
[1:31:34] Ghost it's not going to happen you're
[1:31:36] going to have to have the Holy Ghost in
[1:31:39] fire say oh it's he it's too much of a
[1:31:42] demand it's not a demand it's
[1:31:45] love
[1:31:47] see so the Plan of Redemption was too
[1:31:50] important to Jesus his reward was too
[1:31:54] precious to him as I said the scripture
[1:31:56] says he'll see his seed and be satisfied
[1:31:59] we show showed you Sunday oh I got to
[1:32:01] hurry we showed you Sunday how that
[1:32:04] Isaiah there saw the Lord high and
[1:32:06] lifted up Daniel saw him on the throne
[1:32:08] John saw him in heaven he he later
[1:32:11] describes a white throne and he that sat
[1:32:13] on the throne from whose face the earth
[1:32:15] and the heaven fled away now so now now
[1:32:20] you're coming to the Judgment bar
[1:32:25] and brother brandham says see Satan
[1:32:28] offered him that and had he took it then
[1:32:33] Satan could have a legal
[1:32:35] claim could you imagine after God
[1:32:39] working for 6,000 years to get to that
[1:32:43] great white Throne judgment and now
[1:32:45] we're already past the Rapture we're
[1:32:47] past the 144,000 we're past the
[1:32:50] tribulation we're past the Millennium
[1:32:51] we're at the Judgment bar we're just
[1:32:53] getting ready for the new heavens and
[1:32:55] the new
[1:32:57] Earth and they bring the Bible talks
[1:33:00] about how the enemy is brought before
[1:33:02] him and the Bible says that they shall
[1:33:05] narrowly look upon
[1:33:08] him and humanity is going to be
[1:33:11] stupified to
[1:33:13] say is this the is this the
[1:33:16] man that made Nations tremble and and
[1:33:20] did all that the stuff in the world and
[1:33:23] all the history
[1:33:25] really yeah and and now everything's
[1:33:29] ready the angels are ready to see him
[1:33:32] destroyed the bride is ready the day
[1:33:35] we've waited on our Tormentor is about
[1:33:38] to be finished and Jesus steps forward
[1:33:41] to to to send him to the flames and he
[1:33:45] says just a second and he pulls out
[1:33:48] illegal because this is God on the
[1:33:50] throne who can't be unjust and and can't
[1:33:54] lie and he's he's Bound by his own word
[1:33:57] he can't do anything contrary to his
[1:34:00] word and the devil could say just a
[1:34:03] second could we could we play Replay the
[1:34:07] videotape please how how far do you want
[1:34:10] to go back well I need a thousand years
[1:34:12] from the Millennium then about 2,000
[1:34:13] years let's go back about 3,000 years
[1:34:16] and uh go back to right when he came
[1:34:18] into the Wilderness and yeah you mean
[1:34:21] the bread and all past that oh you you
[1:34:23] mean the the put him up on a and said
[1:34:25] jump off now go a little past that yeah
[1:34:27] keep going fast forward fast for okay
[1:34:29] stop right there now let's play hit
[1:34:32] play they're all
[1:34:35] mine and I'll give them to
[1:34:39] you worship
[1:34:41] me could you imagine if this if as
[1:34:44] brother Bram said on God's Great
[1:34:47] television screen that stretches across
[1:34:49] the whole sky can you imagine the gut
[1:34:53] punch it would be to you and me and all
[1:34:57] of our loved ones and the thing we've
[1:35:00] waited on and Paul fought for and Peter
[1:35:03] died for and Luther took a stand on and
[1:35:06] the of fathers and brother brandom
[1:35:09] around the world seven times Moses and
[1:35:12] Elijah in the tribulation and
[1:35:16] 144,000 and the millennium's already
[1:35:18] done and we're ready to we're at the
[1:35:21] Finish Line we're ready to cross
[1:35:25] over but there's a hitch Jesus took a
[1:35:30] shortcut what does that mean and brother
[1:35:33] Bram goes on to describe here said see
[1:35:36] if he had had a claim and then the whole
[1:35:38] thing breaks down the whole thing
[1:35:41] collapses and everything that we've ever
[1:35:43] lived for is
[1:35:46] finished hence when Satan would come
[1:35:49] back at the Judgment bar and file suit
[1:35:54] against your
[1:35:56] Redeemer and win the
[1:36:01] case if he wins the case against your
[1:36:05] Redeemer then you lose your
[1:36:10] Redemption and and and and and and you
[1:36:14] know even though he he remained
[1:36:17] faithful through those fiery
[1:36:20] trials everything that Satan could put
[1:36:23] him through had he had victory at that
[1:36:26] last moment it all of the victory
[1:36:30] wouldn't have
[1:36:31] mattered I'm here to tell you something
[1:36:33] friends I plan to believe this word all
[1:36:37] the way across the finish line I'm not
[1:36:40] looking to uh live all my life for God
[1:36:44] and get right here to the finish line
[1:36:46] and suddenly my faith wobbles and I want
[1:36:48] the world and I've never been born again
[1:36:50] if I've never been born again I want to
[1:36:52] be born again tonight
[1:36:54] if I don't have the Holy Ghost I want it
[1:36:56] tonight I want it in this service I
[1:36:58] don't even want to leave the building
[1:36:59] until I've
[1:37:01] got Jesus all
[1:37:05] way
[1:37:07] Hallelujah he remained faithful to death
[1:37:10] even the death of the Cross they
[1:37:12] stripped him they beat him they hung him
[1:37:15] on a cross between Heaven and Earth they
[1:37:17] laughed at him they mocked him they
[1:37:19] crucified him and they walked away and
[1:37:21] left him crying for his father
[1:37:25] father I'm so glad that he did they said
[1:37:29] come down save us save yourself and save
[1:37:33] us and what they didn't know is that he
[1:37:35] could have come down and he could have
[1:37:37] saved himself but had he saved himself
[1:37:40] he couldn't save
[1:37:41] you oh I'm so glad that he stayed and he
[1:37:47] endured oh he was Faithful Friends how
[1:37:50] does the world turn him down how do you
[1:37:53] wait one more minute how do you not give
[1:37:55] him your whole heart and your whole life
[1:37:58] and your whole mind you owe him
[1:38:02] everything
[1:38:04] everything we owe him
[1:38:11] everything make this last point I want
[1:38:13] to close I got a few minutes before
[1:38:18] 8:30 brother
[1:38:21] brandham in in the message three kinds
[1:38:24] of
[1:38:24] Believers very late in'
[1:38:28] 63 he says I was
[1:38:31] speaking to a couple this
[1:38:34] afternoon about how that you cannot
[1:38:38] totally annihilate
[1:38:41] anything human beings can't
[1:38:45] annihilate they can tear
[1:38:47] down not annihilate someone said well
[1:38:51] what about taking and burning a piece of
[1:38:53] of paper does that annihilate it no sir
[1:38:57] it only breaks the chemicals apart the
[1:38:59] heat of the fire it goes right back to
[1:39:01] the gases what it was in the beginning
[1:39:04] you cannot
[1:39:05] annihilate and if this world stood long
[1:39:08] enough that same gases that and
[1:39:11] chemicals that was in that paper could
[1:39:13] come right back and be a piece of paper
[1:39:15] again that's exact you cannot annihilate
[1:39:17] exact see now he I don't I don't know is
[1:39:21] he meaning it's come back to a tree and
[1:39:23] be remanufactured I don't know he
[1:39:25] doesn't explain it but it makes sense to
[1:39:26] me I if if time would go on long enough
[1:39:29] it could eventually through the process
[1:39:31] of Nature and through the process of
[1:39:33] manufacturing if that was needed become
[1:39:35] paper again you the point is you you
[1:39:37] can't annihilate
[1:39:39] anything he says God then if there is a
[1:39:44] rection to is if there is a resurrection
[1:39:47] to everything back
[1:39:49] again and no
[1:39:52] Annihilation then there is a
[1:39:54] resurrection of the just yeah and we are
[1:39:58] got to come back now that's the
[1:40:01] beautiful point he's making he's trying
[1:40:04] because you know Paul would say if there
[1:40:05] be no Resurrection if Christ is not
[1:40:07] raised and you're in your sins and it's
[1:40:09] all worthless anyhow see so if he didn't
[1:40:12] raise and then if you don't raise then
[1:40:15] then if you live this life and you go to
[1:40:17] the grave and then nothing is there to
[1:40:18] bring you back and then what what is
[1:40:21] what's it all been about and so brother
[1:40:24] brandham is trying to bring a comfort
[1:40:26] because people say my goodness you know
[1:40:27] what if I'm fed to Lions what if I'm
[1:40:29] burned in a fire what if I you know um
[1:40:32] sit on you know what if I'm in a nuclear
[1:40:34] explosion what if I get torn apart what
[1:40:36] if my ashes get thrown to the Four Winds
[1:40:39] doesn't matter brother Ram said the
[1:40:40] trumpet will sound he'll know it's me
[1:40:42] it'll all come back together anyway see
[1:40:45] and so so his point is that look don't
[1:40:49] worry about that you you've had all
[1:40:53] kinds of losses friends you've had
[1:40:55] things that God ordained that you should
[1:40:58] be but the devil through life through
[1:41:01] life through just life and and a lot of
[1:41:05] opportunities we talked about it earlier
[1:41:06] that we've missed out on and a lot of
[1:41:09] regrets that we have I'm here to tell
[1:41:11] you nothing is annihilated I don't care
[1:41:13] how bad you broke it or the devil broke
[1:41:16] it or you and the devil together broke
[1:41:18] it I'm here to tell you what everything
[1:41:20] that God ever ordained in you you're
[1:41:22] going to get it you're going to come
[1:41:25] back to it no wonder he could say
[1:41:28] everything I loved and everything that
[1:41:30] loved me God is given it God has given
[1:41:32] it because he couldn't lose
[1:41:35] it
[1:41:37] see so it's got to come back that's all
[1:41:40] there is to it there's no way at all of
[1:41:42] doing no matter if you're burned up if
[1:41:44] you're drowned wherever takes
[1:41:46] place they cannot annihilate so brother
[1:41:49] brandham is making the point that there
[1:41:52] has to be
[1:41:53] and there will be a Redemption of
[1:41:57] bringing back what once was and that
[1:42:01] nothing can be annihilated but it but
[1:42:04] but it also makes the indirect point
[1:42:07] that none of my sins that have been
[1:42:11] annihilated can ever come back on
[1:42:14] me no matter how long I'm alive on the
[1:42:18] other side they can never come back on
[1:42:22] me
[1:42:24] because he
[1:42:25] annihilated
[1:42:27] them oh glory to God friends all of my
[1:42:32] sins in the sea of God's forgetfulness
[1:42:34] never to be no wonder he could say I
[1:42:37] make Jerusalem a joy I make the people
[1:42:41] rejoicing Hallelujah friends that
[1:42:43] doesn't matter you might have been
[1:42:45] complicit I'm here to tell you every
[1:42:47] time you make a mistake and you repent
[1:42:50] brother Bram says the error you made
[1:42:52] goes back on the head of the devil and
[1:42:54] he'll have to answer for it not me he'll
[1:42:57] have to answer for it all my sins are in
[1:43:01] the blood of the lamb and they're
[1:43:03] annihilated from my
[1:43:05] life oh we ought to stand up to our feet
[1:43:08] and raise up our hands and say thank you
[1:43:12] Lord Jesus thank you aren't you glad he
[1:43:16] didn't take a
[1:43:18] shortcut aren't you glad he didn't take
[1:43:21] the easy route
[1:43:24] see so he says just
[1:43:28] remember that every part of you was
[1:43:32] here this this ought to give you such
[1:43:36] power no matter what the devil tries to
[1:43:40] front on you with
[1:43:42] tomorrow just
[1:43:44] remember that every part of you was here
[1:43:48] when God spoke the world into existence
[1:43:54] he put your body right here then and
[1:43:57] there is nothing can take it away except
[1:44:01] God it's all back in his
[1:44:05] hands
[1:44:07] again he couldn't leave the Earth on
[1:44:11] that seventh day because it was still in
[1:44:15] time and if time went on long enough and
[1:44:19] there was no
[1:44:21] Annihilation then a sinful world could
[1:44:25] reform you see why it has to have a holy
[1:44:29] fire do you see why you have to have a
[1:44:33] holy fire you see why putting your name
[1:44:37] on a book and shaking a preacher's hand
[1:44:39] can't work you see why man-made religion
[1:44:42] is of no
[1:44:45] value you have to have Holy Fire it's
[1:44:49] got to
[1:44:51] annihilate every trait
[1:44:54] and any claim Satan has ever could ever
[1:44:59] or will ever have on
[1:45:03] me exactly Mo on me on you my loved ones
[1:45:10] on your loved ones on the earth that we
[1:45:12] love that God loves and created friends
[1:45:16] I'm here to tell you something he
[1:45:18] baptizes us with the Holy Ghost in Fire
[1:45:21] and just as his vision of me listen his
[1:45:26] vision of me doesn't
[1:45:27] include any trace of my
[1:45:32] mistakes not his vision now I know
[1:45:35] that's hard for you to get your mind
[1:45:36] around because you're in the shadow but
[1:45:39] I'm here to tell you that his vision of
[1:45:42] me does not
[1:45:44] include it doesn't leave behind Trace
[1:45:48] elements of my failures it doesn't leave
[1:45:51] behind residue it doesn't leave behind
[1:45:54] any DNA it doesn't leave behind any
[1:45:56] forensics it's completely annihilated
[1:46:01] out of existence and no matter how long
[1:46:04] the world will ever go it'll never be
[1:46:08] charged to me again I'm free are you
[1:46:12] free tonight do you know him and the
[1:46:16] power of his
[1:46:18] resurrection bow your heads with me over
[1:46:20] the building

[1:46:56] draw but it but it it's all known and
