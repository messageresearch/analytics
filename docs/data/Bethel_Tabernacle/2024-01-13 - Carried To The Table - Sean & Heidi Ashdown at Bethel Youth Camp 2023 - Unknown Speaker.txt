TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] wounded and forsaken I was shattered by the Fall broken and forgotten feeling lost and alone summoned by the king to the Master's courts lifted by the Savior great in his own I was carried to the table seated where I don't belong car to the [Music] table Away [Music] [Applause] by and I don't see my Brokenness anymore when I'm SE at the table of the Lord I was cared to the table the table of the [Music] Lord fighting thoughts of fear wondering why he called my name am I good enough to share this cup this world has L me weavered in my weakness the Savior called my name and in his holy presence I'm healing on a shame as I'm carried to the [Music] table seated where I don't belong Carri to the table Swept Away by his love and I don't see my Brokenness anymore when I'm seated at the table of the Lord I was carried to the [Music] table the table of the Lord car to the table SE where I don't belong carried to the table Swept Away by his love and I don't see my Brokenness anymore when I'm seated at the table of the Lord just car to the [Music] table the table of the Lord and carry to the [Music] table the table of the Lord [Applause]
