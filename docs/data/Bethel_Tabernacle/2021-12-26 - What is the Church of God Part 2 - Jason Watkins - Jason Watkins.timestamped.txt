[29:12] true church of god now we read last time
[29:16] we took you into the book of corinthians
[29:19] where paul
[29:20] refers to it as the church of god but
[29:23] i'm going to take you to hebrews chapter
[29:25] 12 this morning because we're going to
[29:28] this will be uh
[29:30] kind of the this will be the second part
[29:33] and if you'll just uh bear with me today

[30:09] amen praise the lord well i've got
[30:11] technical difficulties already
[30:14] but the devil ain't nobody so we ain't
[30:16] gonna worry about him
[30:18] amen and uh
[30:20] and this and then hopefully by part
[30:22] three which i will like and i'm just so
[30:24] appreciative to the lord that it looks
[30:26] like it's gonna stack up to where it can
[30:28] be my first
[30:29] sermon in the new year
[30:32] um because i'm not gonna continue this
[30:34] thought on our on our uh our new year's
[30:36] service
[30:37] but i want to continue it as part three
[30:40] as my first sermon in the new year and
[30:42] it'll be more along the preaching side
[30:44] of everything that we've laid groundwork
[30:47] for last time and today we're going to
[30:50] try to be methodical and go about it
[30:52] amen but praise the lord um by the way
[30:55] that reminds me don't forget that this
[30:58] coming midweek service is moved to
[31:00] friday for to new year's don't forget
[31:03] that so our midweek service this coming
[31:06] midweek service is moved to friday so
[31:09] there will be no wednesday service here
[31:12] to be on friday and there we're going to
[31:14] have our communion and foot washing and
[31:16] we're going to hear a little a little uh
[31:18] snippet little sermonette little
[31:21] inspirational words from all of our
[31:23] ministry team
[31:24] amen and uh i'm looking forward that's
[31:27] going to be a special time so
[31:29] amen i hope that uh you are able to make
[31:32] it to that amen praise the lord it's an
[31:34] important
[31:36] important time amen first let's go then
[31:39] to hebrews chapter 12 i don't think i
[31:42] have any other announcements to make
[31:47] you be praying for sister debbie and i
[31:49] we're going to leave after service right
[31:51] away
[31:52] and uh visit her folks
[31:56] for a couple days and then we'll be
[31:58] coming back in the lord willing tuesday
[32:00] evening praise god
[32:03] verse hebrews chapter 12 and i want to
[32:07] begin
[32:08] uh eth what did i tell you verse 12 yeah
[32:11] hebrews 12 and we'll begin at verse 12.
[32:16] you have it say amen
[32:19] wherefore lift up the hands which hang
[32:21] down
[32:22] and the feeble knees
[32:24] and make straight paths for your feet
[32:27] lest that which is lame be turned out of
[32:30] the way but let it rather be healed and
[32:32] amazing that you would have to let it be
[32:34] healed you'd think that would be a
[32:36] no-brainer that i might go of course
[32:37] i'll i'd like to be healed but actually
[32:40] the apostle is giving you some
[32:41] instructions so there must be something
[32:44] to letting it
[32:45] more than just some mental
[32:47] ideology all right
[32:49] follow peace with all men and holiness
[32:53] without which no man shall see the lord
[32:56] looking diligently
[32:58] lest any man fail of the grace of god
[33:01] lest any root of bitterness springing up
[33:04] trouble you and thereby many be defiled
[33:07] can i point out to you that he's
[33:09] speaking to the born-again church of god
[33:13] so there we're less than perfect people
[33:15] and we have to hear things like this to
[33:17] be reminded all right
[33:20] so
[33:21] lest there be verse 16 any fornicator or
[33:24] profane person as esau who for one
[33:27] morsel of meat sold his birthright now
[33:29] paul's not calling a child of god esau
[33:32] but he's saying if you don't stay on it
[33:34] you could end up acting like esau okay
[33:38] so so verse 17 for we know how that
[33:41] afterward when he would have inherited
[33:44] the blessing he was rejected for he
[33:47] found no place of repentance though he
[33:50] sought it carefully with tears
[33:53] for ye are not come
[33:55] unto the mount that might be touched and
[33:57] that burned with fire nor unto blackness
[34:00] and darkness and tempest this is a sinai
[34:02] in the in the wilderness and the sound
[34:05] of a trumpet and the voice of words
[34:08] which voice they that heard and treated
[34:10] that the word should not be spoken to
[34:12] them anymore
[34:14] for they could not endure that which was
[34:16] commanded and if so much as a beast
[34:19] touched the mountain it shall be stoned
[34:21] or thrust through with the dart and so
[34:23] terrible was the sight that moses said i
[34:27] exceedingly fear and quake so we're not
[34:30] come to that all right but ye are come
[34:32] unto mount zion and unto the city of the
[34:36] living god the heavenly jerusalem to an
[34:39] innumerable company of angels to the
[34:42] general assembly and church of the
[34:45] firstborn which are written in heaven
[34:48] and to god the judge of all and to the
[34:51] spirits of just men made perfect
[34:54] i hope to take my place among them my
[34:58] and to jesus the mediator of the new
[35:01] covenant
[35:02] and to the blood of sprinkling that
[35:05] speaketh better things than that of abel
[35:07] see that ye refuse not him that speaketh
[35:11] see
[35:12] for if they escaped not who refused him
[35:16] that spake on earth
[35:18] much more shall not we escape this is us
[35:20] believers if we turn away from him that
[35:23] speaketh from heaven all right
[35:26] whose voice then shook the earth but now
[35:29] he hath promised saying yet more yet
[35:32] once more i shake not the earth only but
[35:35] also heaven
[35:36] and this word yet once more
[35:38] signifieth the removing of those things
[35:41] that are shaken
[35:43] as of things that are made that those
[35:45] things which cannot be shaken
[35:48] may remain
[35:49] so i i know that sometimes
[35:53] we can end up in trials and tribulations
[35:56] and it seems like you're being shook to
[35:58] pieces
[35:59] but just remember there's somebody
[36:01] behind that with love pulling the
[36:03] pulling the trigger
[36:05] a man flipping the switches
[36:08] all right don't forget that it's all
[36:10] done in love wherefore verse 28 here's
[36:13] why he does it this is why
[36:16] wherefore we receive a kingdom which
[36:19] cannot be moved
[36:21] let us have grace whereby we may serve
[36:24] god acceptably with reverence and godly
[36:27] fear for our god is a consuming fire i'm
[36:33] grateful to the lord that he is
[36:36] let's pray
[36:41] father i'm glad you're a consuming fire
[36:43] i'm glad that you
[36:45] you you have the ability if we will
[36:47] allow it if we will get out of our get
[36:50] out of the way get out of our own way
[36:52] get out of your way and let the mind
[36:55] which was in christ be in us if we can
[36:57] get out of our own way and get out of
[36:59] your way and let the word of god dwell
[37:01] in us richly if we can get out of our
[37:04] own way and get over our own self and
[37:06] get out of your way lord and humble our
[37:09] hearts then we can let the word come and
[37:12] do the healing that it needs to do and
[37:14] lord i i i'm i'm reminded of of our
[37:18] service last wednesday where
[37:20] our minister uh showed us out of the
[37:23] scripture that that these things can be
[37:26] these victories can be lived in that
[37:28] they can they can be applied in your
[37:30] life and you can walk in the freedom and
[37:32] the newness that god supplies in this
[37:36] hour
[37:37] lord it meant so much to me to to hear
[37:39] it expressed so so plainly and simply to
[37:42] say my it's not rocket science it's just
[37:45] the love of god who wants to do
[37:47] everything he can to make our lives into
[37:49] his image lord i want to raise up my
[37:52] hands afresh today and say i'm willing
[37:54] lord god let me
[37:56] father humble myself in your presence
[37:58] today to hear this word
[38:00] lord we want to be considered the church
[38:02] of the living god so may you grant it to
[38:04] us today
[38:05] we committed all of our life into your
[38:07] hands we stand proudly under the
[38:10] bloodstained banner of christ we commit
[38:12] it to you in jesus name amen god bless
[38:15] you friends you can be seated
[38:36] so
[38:38] what is
[38:39] the church of god
[38:41] the true church of god
[38:43] we pointed out in our first part we we
[38:46] asked this question
[38:48] from from brother branham's message on
[38:50] the exposition of the seven church ages
[38:53] in the pergam age
[38:55] we brother branham said i wonder if we
[38:59] are sufficiently impressed
[39:01] with the word in our midst and i i i was
[39:06] reminded of that point while reading my
[39:09] text this morning in hebrews 12 that see
[39:13] that you refuse not him who spake now
[39:15] that that is telling us that he's
[39:17] speaking that there was a prophecy of
[39:20] this last day where he would not just
[39:23] shake the the heaven but the heaven and
[39:25] the earth and it would be really almost
[39:28] unprecedented the level at which god
[39:32] would communicate with his family and
[39:35] i'm here to bring you to the
[39:37] acknowledgement and in case you've been
[39:38] asleep at the switch you're it and
[39:41] you're living in it
[39:43] this is the hour when there is
[39:46] almost unbelievable amounts of
[39:48] communication
[39:50] coming from god to you
[39:53] and and therefore if there was ever a
[39:56] time when we want to make sure that we
[39:59] are sufficiently impressed with the word
[40:02] it's now now
[40:04] if if if being
[40:06] if being a
[40:07] member of the family of god how many
[40:10] believe you are
[40:12] if being a member of the family of god
[40:15] and and being a member of this church of
[40:19] the firstborn that paul says you've come
[40:21] unto mount zion
[40:22] that if we believe that we are part of
[40:25] that and we do
[40:27] but but you must
[40:29] take a hold of the fact that
[40:32] being sufficiently
[40:34] impressed sufficiently
[40:36] impressed when you're impressed it has
[40:38] an effect on you
[40:40] amen if something doesn't impress you
[40:42] there's no change in you at all you
[40:43] don't even care you're not even pressed
[40:44] at all but but when something is
[40:47] sufficiently impressed upon you it has a
[40:50] way of effectually changing you
[40:52] you start to say i'd like to be more
[40:54] like that i need to adjust this in my
[40:56] life you might not tell another person
[40:58] but you'll tell yourself
[41:00] wow i got i got a little ways to grow
[41:04] amen
[41:05] but but what you understand what you're
[41:07] understanding in brother branham's
[41:08] statement is it's not automatic just
[41:10] because you're the church of the
[41:12] firstborn
[41:13] that that you need to
[41:15] work on
[41:17] you need to pay attention to
[41:19] yourself
[41:20] that that man in the mirror is
[41:22] sufficiently impressed with what god is
[41:25] doing in this hour and address him to
[41:27] say are you getting it and if you're not
[41:30] you better get on with it because it's
[41:32] purpose driven and god has ways of
[41:34] getting your attention
[41:38] if he can't get it the easy way
[41:41] he will get it
[41:43] you can't beat him
[41:45] stop
[41:46] trying so i'm not trying to beat god you
[41:49] are if you're trying to live your own
[41:50] life
[41:52] see because that's contrary to his will
[41:53] that's contrary to why i put you here
[41:54] it's contrary to why he saved you
[41:57] he puts you here to be a light for him
[42:00] to be a replication of his life he saved
[42:02] you for that purpose and redeemed you
[42:03] all right so if you're warring against
[42:06] becoming that if you're not letting the
[42:08] mind of christ being being you then
[42:10] you're at war with god
[42:13] see you might not have declared it but
[42:15] god has declared it
[42:16] amen
[42:18] so it didn't matter whether or not
[42:20] one nation declares a war they get
[42:22] attacked by another nation
[42:25] you see what i'm you said i'm saying so
[42:27] so god has these ways of doing it so we
[42:30] found out that
[42:32] that this was that the corinthian church
[42:34] was the only church while while paul
[42:36] mentions the church of god loosely in a
[42:39] broader sense in other
[42:41] of his epistles
[42:42] this is the only church the church at
[42:44] corinth it's the only church he
[42:46] addresses as the church of god and we we
[42:49] pondered you know what would what would
[42:51] be up with that that that you know and
[42:53] paul
[42:54] why why why just and he did it twice
[42:58] remember in our lesson from last time
[43:00] he actually did it twice in both letters
[43:02] he wanted to make a point and he never
[43:03] said it like that to any of the church
[43:06] and we found out that he made certain
[43:08] points to them that he
[43:10] he didn't really make so directly to
[43:12] other churches one of the one of the
[43:14] points was
[43:15] uh you know that
[43:17] that
[43:18] that
[43:18] that who they were
[43:21] in christ and what god
[43:23] had called them to do and i and i'm
[43:25] realizing that he talks about that in
[43:27] other churches but paul really takes
[43:30] pains to deal with the corinthians where
[43:33] the rubber meets the road
[43:35] right where they live now that's the
[43:38] most uncomfortable place for a preacher
[43:42] and the most resistant for an audience
[43:46] amen
[43:47] because we're humans
[43:49] and you don't you don't like me telling
[43:51] you what to do and believe me i don't
[43:54] like telling you what to do
[43:56] amen
[43:57] and and and so but but this is this is
[44:00] you know i i just i get it when god
[44:02] calls it the foolishness of preaching i
[44:03] get it believe me
[44:05] so here's the plan let me get this
[44:06] straight you're going to use an
[44:08] imperfect person to perfect imperfect
[44:10] people
[44:12] okay
[44:14] an imperfect person is going to perfect
[44:16] imperfect people
[44:18] anyway
[44:22] but but we found out that
[44:25] that paul takes great pains
[44:28] to
[44:29] to remind them
[44:31] of exactly
[44:32] who they were
[44:34] to
[44:35] constantly it's almost as if they needed
[44:37] that and we found out he didn't seem to
[44:40] need to do that in other churches and so
[44:42] i'm glad god put the letters to
[44:45] corinthia in in the bible
[44:47] because too often times we find
[44:50] ourselves with portions of all of those
[44:51] books i think that god has all the bible
[44:54] we need to give us the complete picture
[44:56] of what we need to be
[44:58] and you don't want to read over
[45:00] corinthians because the tendency of a
[45:01] human being is to go oh they were just a
[45:03] bunch of immature babies and i'm not
[45:05] like that i'm i'm more like the church
[45:07] of philippians where he never had to
[45:09] correct them at all never had to set him
[45:10] in order
[45:12] well you've just demonstrated you're the
[45:13] dead center of corinthians thinking that
[45:16] amen
[45:17] so
[45:18] so uh get over yourself a little bit
[45:23] so maybe they needed to be reminded
[45:25] exactly of this because what they what
[45:28] paul seems to be taking a lot of pains
[45:30] to do is to remind them that they were
[45:33] supposed to be an a guiding example to
[45:36] the people around them that where that
[45:39] we're filled
[45:41] with the spirit of god and i gave you
[45:42] the little microcosm of how that god
[45:46] took israel
[45:47] and started a nation and dropped them
[45:49] right down in the big middle of hedonism
[45:52] all around them
[45:53] and that and and and as that nation god
[45:56] established them as the leading nation
[45:59] of the world even though they were tiny
[46:00] and no one else thought of them like
[46:02] that but god thought of them like that
[46:04] these are my people and and you can
[46:07] imagine that if the creator of the whole
[46:09] world had a people
[46:11] and put them inside of borders that's
[46:14] the leading nation of the world
[46:16] regardless of what other people think
[46:18] that's god's decision and you know from
[46:20] the time this is why the millennium
[46:23] they'll be restored to that because once
[46:25] they were dispersed and went into
[46:27] babylon captivity you have times of
[46:30] restoration where they come back under
[46:32] under joshua and zerubbabel and ezra
[46:34] nehemiah and you have all of that but
[46:36] israel is never established after that
[46:39] after that captivity in babylon they're
[46:42] they lose that position as the leading
[46:45] nation of the world but they are
[46:47] restored to that in the millennium
[46:49] they become the leading nation of the
[46:51] world and and the king lives among them
[46:55] in the holy city and the king's bride
[46:57] lives there and israel is restored as
[46:59] the leading nation
[47:01] of the world
[47:03] to to usher god's commands and ways that
[47:07] are to be lived out in the millennium
[47:08] among the gentiles
[47:10] all right and gentile nations and
[47:12] there'll be many millions
[47:15] and so so we find out that that paul is
[47:18] trying to get the true church now you've
[47:21] said here a few minutes ago you felt
[47:23] like you were the true church well just
[47:25] then then absorb this that that we're
[47:28] given the spirit to
[47:30] to live in us to set the record straight
[47:35] on
[47:36] against the false narrative that's in
[47:39] the world on what is a true christian
[47:41] amen
[47:42] and the whole world has a skewed very
[47:45] upside down and broken view
[47:48] on what it means to be a christian just
[47:50] like all the heathen nations thought
[47:52] they knew what the gods were and israel
[47:54] was sit there in the middle of them to
[47:56] go you're all completely wrong and we're
[47:58] not going to just tell you we're going
[48:00] to demonstrate in our lives that there's
[48:03] only one true and living god and that's
[48:05] the true church today
[48:08] here i go that's that's you and me
[48:10] we're here for that very purpose
[48:14] we're filled with the spirit of god not
[48:16] to come to a building and pay ties and
[48:18] sing and sing songs we're here to
[48:20] establish a light
[48:22] of accuracy to the world
[48:25] that's
[48:26] the true
[48:28] church
[48:29] you claim to be a part of
[48:35] to correct the false narrative
[48:38] we found out that the church of god is a
[48:40] fellowship of saints in the earth who
[48:43] share this common purpose
[48:46] to be representatives
[48:48] of god's kingdom in heaven living in the
[48:50] earth we found out it was a brotherhood
[48:52] of love it's a it's a brotherhood of
[48:54] faith it's designed why do we meet here
[48:57] it's designed to enrich our lives it's
[49:00] designed to grow us together so that
[49:02] we're all for one and one for all and
[49:05] there's no great ones little eyed big
[49:07] eyes little used it's all one the cross
[49:10] the ground is level at the foot of
[49:12] calvary
[49:13] we have different offices we have
[49:14] different positions but we're all one in
[49:16] christ
[49:19] it's a family
[49:21] we found out it has great compassion and
[49:23] care one for another it's supposed to
[49:25] have anyway
[49:27] the harmony we we made a mention
[49:29] near the end of
[49:31] of that last sermon how the
[49:33] how that the harmony
[49:35] here we have here it's so appreciated
[49:37] you don't know how proud that makes me
[49:40] uh
[49:41] to see
[49:42] such harmony and and you know and
[49:45] fellowship that comes among us
[49:47] um as we love and care for one another
[49:50] and we meet here and and we've got each
[49:52] other's back and we've all got our
[49:54] shoulder to the wheel
[49:56] that is more rare than you might believe
[49:58] and i'm not just trying to you know well
[50:01] maybe i am trying to brag on us a little
[50:03] bit and that's okay
[50:04] i'm proud of you
[50:06] amen and believe me as one who's
[50:08] traveled the world and preached this
[50:10] message on six of seven continents i
[50:12] know i know what a harmonious church
[50:14] looks like and what it doesn't look like
[50:16] amen
[50:17] amen
[50:19] so the church of god and what it stands
[50:21] for
[50:23] stands for a lot of things we could take
[50:25] off on any one of these it stands for
[50:27] purity and wholesomeness
[50:29] stands for righteousness and
[50:32] and sincerity
[50:34] before god
[50:35] you know uh
[50:37] when something is not sincere i remember
[50:39] years ago brother dale took took a a
[50:42] sermon like that as brother dale so
[50:44] often would do
[50:46] excuse me take things uh and just break
[50:48] them down into a sermon it was so
[50:49] beautiful i heard him preach a sermon
[50:51] one time on the new birth he used a
[50:53] gas combustion engine push rod motor it
[50:56] was fantastic that was brother dale dr
[50:58] smith as we call him
[51:01] and and and he he took a sermon on being
[51:03] sincere he went back to the history to
[51:06] show the origin of that word where you
[51:08] had
[51:09] makers of vessels and
[51:11] you you there there had to be a stamp a
[51:14] sincere as i remember it uh and and it
[51:17] was a seal to mean that this vessel had
[51:20] been held up to light and passed the
[51:23] water test and the light test and there
[51:25] were no cracks that you couldn't see but
[51:27] no light no water could get through and
[51:29] that it was sincere
[51:31] this was a this was a good vessel if you
[51:35] bought one that didn't have that
[51:36] government seal then you you you might
[51:39] get something that you get at home and
[51:41] it's going to leak and be useless
[51:45] and so
[51:46] you know there there had to be a real
[51:47] one and there had to be a less than real
[51:49] one
[51:50] and and that's why
[51:52] one of the things that we stand for is
[51:54] sincerity before god
[51:56] that we're not here as secret sinners
[51:59] and fake christians we're here for keeps
[52:01] we're here for real we're here because
[52:03] we love it i'm not here because i'm
[52:05] compelled against my will to do anything
[52:08] i come here because i want to come here
[52:10] i believe it because i desire to believe
[52:12] it i i'm right i live a righteous life
[52:15] because i enjoy righteous life if i if i
[52:18] slip in my righteousness i repent for
[52:20] that because i can't stand to be under
[52:22] that amen amen
[52:27] a true church is a fortress
[52:30] it's a place where we can come together
[52:32] it's a a city of refuge it's a hospital
[52:37] a hospital
[52:39] to care
[52:40] for the sick and dying
[52:42] who are sick and dying from the diseases
[52:44] of sin and bethel tabernacle
[52:48] here and abroad
[52:49] please don't ever forget that amen
[52:52] because a hospital sometimes takes in
[52:54] the sick and wounded
[52:56] and they sometimes sit among us and i've
[52:58] seen i've seen the sick and wounded come
[53:00] into churches who didn't have this kind
[53:02] of harmony who didn't have this kind of
[53:04] confidence in the ministry and they were
[53:06] biting and judging and and gossiping and
[53:09] killing and destroying i i remember a
[53:12] church and it's not up to me to judge
[53:15] them they'll answer to god for it on the
[53:16] day of judgment i remember a day when my
[53:18] brother
[53:19] who really got a hold of god and gave
[53:21] his heart to the lord and went strong
[53:22] for quite a while but because his past
[53:25] had been so nefarious and off the rails
[53:28] the church that he tried to go to
[53:30] wouldn't give him any any credit they
[53:32] just held him in suspicion they always
[53:34] judged him they always were questioning
[53:36] he never felt at home he never felt
[53:38] confident and you know what it
[53:40] discouraged him and he ended up six
[53:42] eight months later going back off the
[53:44] rails and never recovered
[53:47] never stopped witnessing this message
[53:49] never stopped believing it
[53:51] nathan was the kind that he was so
[53:53] believed he'd give you a book and if you
[53:54] didn't believe he didn't fight you
[53:57] that's a true story
[53:59] if you didn't believe it he would just
[54:00] fist fight you on the spot
[54:02] and he wasn't one you'd want to fist
[54:04] fight with
[54:06] i said nate that's not how you do it
[54:07] that's how i do it okay
[54:10] that's not how jesus did it
[54:17] but it's a hospital
[54:19] for the sick and dying
[54:22] and i'm i'd like to say that i'm glad
[54:25] i don't oversee a church that's like
[54:27] that amen
[54:28] i'm glad i don't see an over church that
[54:30] oversee a church that's judgmental and
[54:32] suspicious of everybody
[54:34] and and i just i just say this friends
[54:36] and i've said it for years
[54:38] that show me an overly suspicious person
[54:41] and i'll show you a dishonest person
[54:44] show me an overly judgmental person i'll
[54:46] show you a person who wants to do that
[54:47] but they're afraid to and so they judge
[54:48] you for doing it
[54:50] see and they're overly suspicious
[54:53] because they themselves go to sleep
[54:54] every night knowing how guilty they are
[54:56] of hypocrisy
[54:57] and so they're automatically suspicious
[54:59] they figure everybody's like them well
[55:01] they're not
[55:02] we're not we're sincere we love god for
[55:06] real hallelujah hallelujah
[55:09] see
[55:11] i've seen a lot of people become very
[55:12] very religious in my life and they they
[55:14] never seem to get more spiritual
[55:17] yeah amen
[55:18] wow
[55:20] corrective love begins at a true church
[55:25] corrective
[55:26] love
[55:27] begins in the church of god
[55:31] its main message now i want to make be
[55:33] real clear
[55:34] its main message is not to tear down
[55:38] but to declare the gospel
[55:41] so that mankind can free himself from
[55:44] sin
[55:45] so sometimes it seems harsh but it's
[55:48] it's not i mean if if you're
[55:51] wrapped up
[55:52] in vines you know like like jesus talks
[55:55] about some of the seed fell by the
[55:57] wayside and some among stony ground and
[56:00] it had no root and the wayside the birds
[56:02] picked it up that's that you heard it in
[56:04] the church and you know it was
[56:05] interesting and then you were
[56:06] entertained by it you got out in the
[56:07] birds of the air the demons took it away
[56:09] and it meant nothing you go on with your
[56:10] life and then the the stoning ground
[56:13] because there's no you never really
[56:14] you're a shallow person you never really
[56:16] have any depth you don't really let the
[56:18] god's word get deep in your heart you
[56:21] anon with joy it excites you you feel
[56:23] like you're part of a new membership a
[56:24] new club you get a new jacket but but
[56:26] you're not
[56:28] you're not one that can put roots down
[56:30] to where what happens is then when
[56:32] offenses come you get offended oh i
[56:34] don't want to be persecuted
[56:36] and you start dreaming up all kinds of
[56:38] nonsensical ideas to say oh well you
[56:41] know we we don't need to be that hard we
[56:43] need to show love to everybody and and i
[56:46] and i and when i see a person going like
[56:48] that i know they're headed one way out
[56:50] and they're just doing this
[56:52] you know we just need to be a little
[56:54] more tolerant of the world we don't need
[56:55] to be so weird
[56:56] and and you know what i do i just go
[56:58] okay bye i see you i know where you're
[57:00] going
[57:00] i know i know you're just posturing
[57:02] that's all you're doing you're posturing
[57:04] you're the next thing you'll do is start
[57:06] finding fault with god's word and the
[57:08] teaching and then the people and then
[57:09] the next thing you know you'll backslide
[57:11] the next thing you know you'll be off
[57:12] into a ditch somewhere and hating god
[57:15] and i know i have seen it yeah i've seen
[57:17] it too many times
[57:19] and
[57:20] and and and and so we you know we we
[57:22] look at it this way and
[57:25] and but then there was a kind that gets
[57:27] among thorns
[57:29] and it starts growing
[57:31] but the
[57:32] you know the it doesn't maintain its
[57:34] garden very well and the briars and the
[57:37] weeds and the vines wrap around it and
[57:39] start choking the life out of it well
[57:41] you know i'm sorry if sometimes the the
[57:43] preaching seems cutting but the only way
[57:46] i can get you out of that is with a
[57:47] sword
[57:48] that's pretty sharp
[57:50] and and it's and depending on how wound
[57:53] up you are might cut you up a little bit
[57:54] getting you free
[57:56] but it's love
[57:58] it's corrective love
[58:01] it it's not to make you feel bad or make
[58:03] you quit church or get offended jesus
[58:05] said blessed is he who is not offended
[58:08] in me
[58:10] see
[58:11] amen
[58:13] its main message is not to tear down it
[58:16] is to
[58:17] declare the gospel so that mankind can
[58:19] go free it's to it's to it's a place
[58:21] where uh a proclamation of liberty uh to
[58:24] free to
[58:28] timothy 2 26 and that they may recover
[58:32] themselves out of the snare of the devil
[58:34] who are taken captive by him at his will
[58:37] hebrews 2 15 and deliver them who
[58:40] through fear of death were all their
[58:42] lifetimes subject to bondage and so in
[58:44] order to accomplish this there often
[58:47] needs to be a tearing down first before
[58:49] i can build you up
[58:51] so sometimes yes the ministry has to
[58:54] tear you down a bit
[58:55] but it's it's got a long-term goal it's
[58:58] not cruelty or being nasty if i get
[59:01] preachers like that they will never
[59:04] get access to this pulpit
[59:06] over the years i have guarded this
[59:08] pulpit i will not let men who like
[59:11] hurting you
[59:13] preach behind this desk and if one ever
[59:15] slips through the cracks he's never
[59:17] allowed to come back again and there's
[59:18] been men that have been banned from ever
[59:20] coming back to this pulpit you would
[59:21] never know who they are but i know who
[59:23] they are
[59:24] i'm not going to let my family be abused
[59:27] and browbeat to death i don't do you
[59:28] that way none of the ministry team here
[59:31] is geared that way you notice that
[59:33] you notice that
[59:35] none of the ministry team here is geared
[59:36] like that because they've been trained
[59:38] and brought up right and god gave them a
[59:40] correct spirit to love god's people
[59:44] and i'm thanking god for that
[59:46] amen
[59:47] amen and so so so so it's to accomplish
[59:52] sometimes there has to be a tear down
[59:54] but remember that judgment does begin at
[59:57] the house of the lord please don't
[59:59] forget that
[1:00:01] see
[1:00:02] lest you be you know you know wise in
[1:00:04] your own conceit and the devil end up
[1:00:07] leading you astray and gets you all
[1:00:08] wounded and offended
[1:00:10] and upset and the next thing you know
[1:00:12] you're you know you don't like the
[1:00:14] decision that the that the pastor makes
[1:00:16] you don't like the way things are run
[1:00:18] and you're the next thing you're doing
[1:00:20] is you're leaving the church slamming
[1:00:22] doors and you're you're being nasty and
[1:00:25] and and snipey you know to people around
[1:00:28] you and judgmental of everybody in front
[1:00:29] of you and in back of you and you're the
[1:00:31] holy one
[1:00:33] bethel tabernacle has no place for that
[1:00:36] and somebody that's like that we'll be
[1:00:38] happy to take them in but i'm going to
[1:00:40] start with the sword pretty quick to get
[1:00:42] rid of that and then try to build them
[1:00:43] up in the love of god and show them
[1:00:46] we're all in this thing together
[1:00:49] amen
[1:00:51] sure our teenagers go through battles so
[1:00:53] did you
[1:00:54] adults so did you adults
[1:00:57] see
[1:00:58] sure they parents sometimes are forced
[1:01:01] into positions less less than where
[1:01:03] they'd like to be standing trying to
[1:01:05] keep an arm around that loved that loved
[1:01:07] one but but listen friends keep an arm
[1:01:10] around them because god can get a hold
[1:01:12] of them
[1:01:13] and don't ever make them feel ostracized
[1:01:16] and don't any of you adults ever try to
[1:01:17] do that you will have me to deal with i
[1:01:19] promise you i will always side with them
[1:01:22] amen always
[1:01:24] i've been known from that for that since
[1:01:26] 1995 i if i have to empty this church
[1:01:29] and have only my teenagers i'll do it
[1:01:31] because i will not let them be executed
[1:01:33] like that
[1:01:34] amen and i i've had people resist me and
[1:01:37] tell me i was too compromising well
[1:01:40] some of them ain't even alive anymore
[1:01:42] and the other ones aren't even in church
[1:01:43] anymore
[1:01:45] but i'm still here
[1:01:47] and god's still here and the love is
[1:01:49] still here and the word is still here
[1:01:51] hallelujah and i make no apologies for
[1:01:54] that
[1:01:55] amen and so we we love our youth and we
[1:01:58] we know the struggles we went through
[1:02:00] when we were their age and i want to
[1:02:02] tell you something if you if you've got
[1:02:04] small children and you're raising small
[1:02:06] children i heard brother tim pruitt say
[1:02:07] this probably 25 years ago i never
[1:02:09] forgot it's so impactful get ready to be
[1:02:11] impacted
[1:02:12] he said that if you're raising small
[1:02:14] children and you're sitting back
[1:02:16] judging parents who are raising
[1:02:17] teenagers and they're not doing it the
[1:02:19] way you think they should be done he
[1:02:20] said you just be very kind
[1:02:22] [Music]
[1:02:24] you be very kind
[1:02:26] because down the road that's going to
[1:02:28] come back on you
[1:02:30] and you're going to find yourself facing
[1:02:32] a worse generation because every
[1:02:33] generation is worse
[1:02:36] amen
[1:02:37] now how many still want to be the church
[1:02:39] of god
[1:02:40] all right
[1:02:43] for the time first peter 4 17 and 18 for
[1:02:46] the time has come that judgment must
[1:02:49] begin at the house of god
[1:02:51] and if it first begin at us
[1:02:54] what shall the end be of them that obey
[1:02:56] not the gospel of god and if the
[1:02:59] righteous scarcely be saved where shall
[1:03:01] the ungodly and the sinner appear
[1:03:03] so you know it reminds me of of the
[1:03:06] apostles warning how shall we escape if
[1:03:08] we neglect so great of salvation
[1:03:11] that answer i forget what they call that
[1:03:13] that question is self-answering the the
[1:03:16] answers within the question how shall we
[1:03:18] escape if you neglect this great word of
[1:03:21] this hour here's the answer you won't
[1:03:25] you'll suffer terrible consequences for
[1:03:27] neglecting it
[1:03:29] see so don't neglect it
[1:03:32] you know don't harden your hearts
[1:03:33] against god's word see
[1:03:36] so so judgment does begin at the house
[1:03:38] of god according to first peter 4 but
[1:03:40] there's always mercy even in the tearing
[1:03:43] if if i have to do some tearing first
[1:03:45] there's all there's always mercy in the
[1:03:47] tearing there's mercy even in the
[1:03:50] judgment because james 2 13 tells us
[1:03:53] that mercy rejoiceth against judgment
[1:03:57] you don't know how many times i've
[1:03:58] raised up my hands and said lord i'm
[1:04:00] going to rejoice
[1:04:01] because i know i should reap your
[1:04:03] judgment but i know i have your mercy
[1:04:07] and i'm taking it right now i'm taking
[1:04:09] it before anybody else gets it gets me
[1:04:11] from it i'm going to take in all the
[1:04:12] mercy i can
[1:04:14] so when judgment comes knocking mercy
[1:04:17] answers the door
[1:04:18] and says oh judgment says oh you live
[1:04:21] here yes
[1:04:22] okay never mind
[1:04:27] why does it assemble
[1:04:29] why do we gather in a building
[1:04:31] why not just sit home and watch and
[1:04:32] stream
[1:04:36] we have a
[1:04:37] a gathering place to gather for hearing
[1:04:42] the will of god
[1:04:44] uh in his word proclaimed by servants of
[1:04:48] his calling
[1:04:50] and there is
[1:04:52] nothing to replace
[1:04:54] live ministry
[1:04:56] and
[1:04:57] live anointing and everybody
[1:05:00] in here that's ever straight streamed
[1:05:02] would say amen to that
[1:05:05] that there it's great we're we're happy
[1:05:08] for technology we love to be able to
[1:05:10] stream but there is no substitute for a
[1:05:13] live service
[1:05:15] see
[1:05:17] you hear a lot of people saying amen who
[1:05:18] were forced into those streaming
[1:05:20] situations before and are happy to have
[1:05:23] live ministry now
[1:05:27] what is the true church well what is it
[1:05:29] not
[1:05:31] it's not an organization
[1:05:34] organized of men
[1:05:37] it doesn't exist
[1:05:39] in a box of rules
[1:05:41] structure and regulation
[1:05:44] the word
[1:05:45] doesn't come for that
[1:05:48] it comes to change the nature of a
[1:05:51] person
[1:05:53] so it's not about making you fit into my
[1:05:55] box it's i'm not trying to reform you
[1:05:58] i'm trying to get a nature change
[1:06:01] see this is why a lot of times we'll be
[1:06:03] very lenient and very merciful and very
[1:06:05] kind and very patient and very tolerant
[1:06:08] as paul the jews didn't want to do that
[1:06:10] you remember paul dealt with that i
[1:06:12] think in chapter two of romans
[1:06:15] and he he dealt with those jews who just
[1:06:17] who just you know here comes these
[1:06:19] gentiles in and they've been heathens
[1:06:21] yesterday and the jews want them to walk
[1:06:23] according to the law of moses the next
[1:06:25] day
[1:06:26] and paul's like good grief guys
[1:06:28] didn't the lord give you wasn't he
[1:06:30] patient and kind with you giving you an
[1:06:34] opportunity to repent of of your
[1:06:37] judaistic ways that was nothing but a
[1:06:39] form of godliness while you denied the
[1:06:41] power thereof did wasn't god kind and
[1:06:43] gentle and merciful to you and gave you
[1:06:45] time
[1:06:47] and then you just wanna you want these
[1:06:48] gentiles to just wash up overnight how
[1:06:51] about we get their heart changed
[1:06:53] get the love of god in their life and
[1:06:54] the holy spirit will do that work
[1:06:57] you don't you don't need to shine each
[1:06:58] other up i don't need to shine you up
[1:07:01] this isn't this isn't a shoe shine this
[1:07:03] is the power of god
[1:07:06] to move in our lives this is what a true
[1:07:09] church of the living god is where the
[1:07:11] holy ghost is in charge
[1:07:13] where jesus is the pastor
[1:07:21] the true church of the living god is not
[1:07:23] a social service
[1:07:26] and it doesn't oversee social services
[1:07:28] programs
[1:07:32] so you got a problem with social
[1:07:33] services programs in the church no they
[1:07:35] accomplish a good task i'm just simply
[1:07:36] saying that's brother branham said it
[1:07:38] over and over and over he said i got no
[1:07:39] problem with hospitals and schools and
[1:07:42] orphanages he said but god never sent us
[1:07:43] to build hospitals and schools and
[1:07:45] orphanages he called us to preach the
[1:07:46] gospel
[1:07:48] see the the sick the poor you're always
[1:07:50] going to have them with you and god
[1:07:52] blesses and raises and lowers and does
[1:07:54] he's in control so we just say lord i'm
[1:07:57] just happy to be your child
[1:07:59] and whatever life you have a sign for me
[1:08:01] just let me be willing to walk in it
[1:08:03] see
[1:08:06] so
[1:08:07] what is
[1:08:08] and what isn't its role
[1:08:11] one of the things it does is it does
[1:08:13] supply spiritual food in due season
[1:08:17] and that's done to meet the challenge of
[1:08:20] the hour
[1:08:21] it does it here's one thing it does it
[1:08:24] hands out life guidance but it does it
[1:08:27] freely
[1:08:28] amen it doesn't charge for that
[1:08:31] it hands out life guys some people don't
[1:08:33] want it but i still have to offer it see
[1:08:37] and and remember a pardon is only a
[1:08:39] pardon if it's received that way i can't
[1:08:40] make you accept the pardon of christ but
[1:08:43] i can tell you about the pardon i can
[1:08:45] demonstrate that i have here's what it's
[1:08:47] done in my life sometimes people say i
[1:08:49] can't witness because i can't remember
[1:08:51] all the quotes in the scriptures and i
[1:08:52] don't think i can teach it you're not
[1:08:54] you're not even you're not even called
[1:08:55] to that don't try to do my job don't try
[1:08:57] to get up here and handle the fires of
[1:08:58] god
[1:08:59] go tell them how your camel got lit go
[1:09:01] tell them what god did for you because
[1:09:03] that can't be debated that's your
[1:09:05] experience
[1:09:07] and nobody can challenge you on it
[1:09:08] because you were there you ought to know
[1:09:10] it happened to you
[1:09:12] so i don't believe that well that's too
[1:09:13] bad it happened to me i was there it's
[1:09:15] all true it happened to me
[1:09:20] as gulliver tried to tell him these
[1:09:22] things are all true and happened to me
[1:09:26] and i had him on trial
[1:09:32] those are some of the things that it is
[1:09:35] it supplies spiritual food it to meet
[1:09:37] the challenge of the hour it hands out
[1:09:40] life guidance it is not
[1:09:42] an authoritarian entity
[1:09:46] not an authoritarian entity
[1:09:49] it possesses no power of force or
[1:09:52] compulsion
[1:09:54] sometimes
[1:09:55] legalists want the preachers to be that
[1:09:57] way
[1:09:59] see
[1:10:00] but but its leaders have no mandate from
[1:10:02] god to lord it over the people
[1:10:06] nor to be elevated by the people
[1:10:09] amen
[1:10:10] see
[1:10:15] those who are invested with spiritual
[1:10:17] authority
[1:10:19] they
[1:10:20] must be approved
[1:10:23] of the people they they must be found
[1:10:25] loyal and faithful to god among the
[1:10:27] saints amen and you have a right to
[1:10:29] expect that
[1:10:31] you have a right that preachers live
[1:10:33] what they preach
[1:10:35] and that you won't see them preaching it
[1:10:36] on wednesday and then committing it on
[1:10:38] saturday
[1:10:40] preaching against it on wednesday and
[1:10:41] then it's suddenly it doesn't apply to
[1:10:44] them that's never ever to be true
[1:10:47] and the people aren't wrong to question
[1:10:49] that and say hey what's what's what
[1:10:50] gives
[1:10:52] you know
[1:10:53] and and
[1:10:54] and a preacher who can't be asked about
[1:10:56] something he ministered without getting
[1:10:58] you know his dander all up and feeling
[1:11:00] like he's been uh confronted just just
[1:11:03] remember brothers my fellow ministers
[1:11:06] your servants
[1:11:08] to these people
[1:11:09] see we serve his majesty the king we're
[1:11:13] servants to them on his behalf
[1:11:15] we're not more than that ever
[1:11:18] ever see
[1:11:21] they must be found loyal
[1:11:23] and faithful
[1:11:25] to god among the saints you know
[1:11:27] jeremiah i won't take the time to go to
[1:11:29] it but jeremiah was assured because the
[1:11:32] whole thing came up with jeremiah and he
[1:11:34] almost quit preaching over it and
[1:11:35] practice he actually tried to do that
[1:11:38] told god he was finished and threw into
[1:11:39] town wouldn't preach anymore because
[1:11:40] people just they wouldn't listen to a
[1:11:42] thing he said and he kept trying to warn
[1:11:44] him kept trying to correct them he loved
[1:11:46] him he was trying to help him
[1:11:47] but they you know they hung him up in
[1:11:49] suspended cages they threw rotten fruit
[1:11:52] at him they fed him though bread of
[1:11:54] water affliction and
[1:11:56] and and jeremiah got the rough end of
[1:11:59] things
[1:12:00] and and and god you know came to tell
[1:12:02] him there in in and i'm not going to go
[1:12:05] into it today because it's a whole
[1:12:06] sermon in itself
[1:12:07] that god just simply said listen
[1:12:09] jeremiah just understand that there's
[1:12:12] going to be people
[1:12:13] who who really don't they're not going
[1:12:16] to listen to what you say
[1:12:18] and don't worry
[1:12:20] i'll handle it
[1:12:22] and that made jeremiah feel like okay
[1:12:25] okay i don't have to deal with it
[1:12:28] god will deal with it and he was assured
[1:12:31] that god would deal with those people
[1:12:34] who refused his message and thus god's
[1:12:36] servants and his messengers uh are
[1:12:39] vessels who proclaim god's word
[1:12:43] to the people under inspiration and if
[1:12:46] people will not line up to god's
[1:12:48] commands then god will deal with them
[1:12:51] i don't have to spend my time don't you
[1:12:54] sit there and wonder why isn't the
[1:12:55] pastor
[1:12:57] going after them i don't have to do that
[1:12:59] god will deal with them
[1:13:02] i'm telling you in almost three decades
[1:13:04] of pastoring i've learned that more
[1:13:06] almost more than any other single thing
[1:13:10] to let people be people and let god deal
[1:13:13] with his children
[1:13:16] only in the most i'm not saying it
[1:13:19] wouldn't exist because it hasn't it
[1:13:20] would don't think it wouldn't
[1:13:22] but only in the most egregious situation
[1:13:26] does the ministry
[1:13:28] reluctantly
[1:13:30] uh and in humility
[1:13:32] does it even attempt to compel a person
[1:13:34] to keep god's word
[1:13:37] have you taken people aside yes
[1:13:39] do you sure would you absolutely but
[1:13:42] only in the most egregious situation
[1:13:45] where i could see weeks and weeks and
[1:13:47] months and months and a long time and
[1:13:49] and somebody's just such a blatant
[1:13:51] offender that finally paul said listen
[1:13:53] you take and you finally deal with it
[1:13:56] and you rebuke him sharply that's that's
[1:13:58] not the rule that's an exception to the
[1:14:01] rule
[1:14:02] what's the rule that that's an exception
[1:14:04] to the servant of god must be gentle
[1:14:08] he must be patient
[1:14:10] giving people the opportunity to repent
[1:14:13] and correct because hey in case you
[1:14:15] haven't noticed this he himself deals
[1:14:17] with his own ups and downs and
[1:14:19] weaknesses
[1:14:20] see
[1:14:21] my own failures that i am so aware and
[1:14:24] sometimes so painfully aware of it who
[1:14:27] who would i be to take you aside i'm
[1:14:29] god's child you're god's child and i'm
[1:14:31] gonna i'm gonna you know bring some
[1:14:34] authoritarian lord it over you forced to
[1:14:36] compel you and make you line up and
[1:14:38] stick you in a box and put spiritual
[1:14:40] handcuffs on you nope amen
[1:14:43] not happening
[1:14:44] that's not the kind of pastor i am if
[1:14:46] you're ever looking for me to be that
[1:14:47] kind you're at the wrong church
[1:14:50] because i don't believe that's what the
[1:14:52] true church of god
[1:14:54] is i'm not trying to reform i'm trying
[1:14:59] to change the nature
[1:15:02] amen
[1:15:05] what is the church not it is not
[1:15:08] connected to political agendas of
[1:15:10] mankind
[1:15:13] it is not involved in politics whatever
[1:15:17] that's right amen
[1:15:19] amen their
[1:15:21] politics
[1:15:24] republican democrat independent or
[1:15:26] otherwise
[1:15:27] they're all of the devil
[1:15:30] i know there's good people trying to
[1:15:31] make a difference in there i'm not
[1:15:33] talking about the people i'm talking
[1:15:34] about the system
[1:15:35] the sooner you get this through your
[1:15:37] head the better off you'll be in life a
[1:15:39] prophet said it
[1:15:41] education
[1:15:43] civilization
[1:15:44] politics
[1:15:46] all of it is of the devil
[1:15:49] he's the god of this evil age and
[1:15:53] therefore i'm not involved in politics
[1:15:56] what i do is interpret modern events
[1:15:58] through prophecy in god's word what i do
[1:16:02] is i blow trumpets of spiritual war
[1:16:05] that's what i do what i do is i sound
[1:16:07] the alarm
[1:16:09] when i see the enemy approaching
[1:16:12] when i see him approaching in your
[1:16:14] family or your young people are or this
[1:16:16] church or uh
[1:16:18] the ministry is here to blow a trumpet
[1:16:21] to declare war to spot an enemy that's
[1:16:23] approaching and i'm trying to help you
[1:16:25] to notice it
[1:16:27] see
[1:16:29] it moves the ministry is constantly
[1:16:31] moving to adjust the signal flags of
[1:16:33] battle
[1:16:35] to meet the prevailing threat in the
[1:16:37] field of spiritual battle how many know
[1:16:39] that's where we are today
[1:16:40] you're not at disney world sorry
[1:16:43] you're in a spiritual warfare
[1:16:46] and this is what it means to be the
[1:16:48] church of god you can be in the army
[1:16:51] called the church of god because there's
[1:16:52] a battle
[1:16:53] there's war there's nowhere it's not
[1:16:57] there's nowhere it's not war
[1:16:59] so you got two choices pick your army
[1:17:02] you can be in the army of the church of
[1:17:03] god or you can be in somewhere else
[1:17:07] see
[1:17:09] so you're not going to get out of the
[1:17:11] fight so i would just rather fight on
[1:17:13] the winning side
[1:17:17] a true ministry a true church of god
[1:17:21] not just the ministry but the people
[1:17:24] they seek both to create
[1:17:27] and foster
[1:17:29] in the hearts
[1:17:30] of other believers
[1:17:32] an irresistible
[1:17:34] urge to conduct our lives to behave
[1:17:38] ourselves according to the dictates of
[1:17:40] god's word amen
[1:17:42] i'm here to tell you today
[1:17:45] if you don't know christ in this way
[1:17:47] where all your desires of your heart are
[1:17:49] are for him
[1:17:51] and that you and that you love him more
[1:17:53] than you love you
[1:17:55] if that's not true for you let me tell
[1:17:57] you about a man who can help you
[1:18:00] let me tell you about someone who can
[1:18:02] give you an irresistible
[1:18:04] sweep you off your feet into a love
[1:18:07] affair you'll you'll get swept off your
[1:18:09] feet like any bride would love you'll be
[1:18:11] wrapped up in the arms of a king who
[1:18:13] loves you
[1:18:14] who puts life inside you said i found
[1:18:17] you in the wilderness lying in your own
[1:18:19] blood and i picked you up and i carried
[1:18:21] you home and i cleaned you with clean
[1:18:23] water
[1:18:24] that's the kind that's what the church
[1:18:26] of the living god is amen
[1:18:31] there is one
[1:18:34] we find that
[1:18:37] and it's sad to preach this in a message
[1:18:39] assembly but
[1:18:44] the church of god the true church of god
[1:18:47] in any age
[1:18:49] this age or any age
[1:18:51] all right
[1:18:53] um
[1:18:57] it's going to surprise you what i'm
[1:18:59] about to say
[1:19:01] and you it's hard and it's going to
[1:19:03] surprise you because you'd say
[1:19:04] why are you preaching that in a message
[1:19:06] church
[1:19:07] here's what the true church does not do
[1:19:09] it does not accept the intercessory of
[1:19:12] saints
[1:19:16] it doesn't it doesn't
[1:19:19] collude with the dead it doesn't attempt
[1:19:22] to
[1:19:24] fellowship the dead
[1:19:27] it doesn't stand for that
[1:19:30] that's spiritualism
[1:19:32] and good people did you hear me say that
[1:19:35] good people
[1:19:36] did the internet hear me say that
[1:19:38] good people for real good people
[1:19:41] children of god
[1:19:42] can get caught in that
[1:19:44] and it is it is extremely
[1:19:48] slick and how it's presented and it is
[1:19:51] it is a growing threat in this hour
[1:19:53] among messages that mess message
[1:19:55] assemblies we do not have intercessory
[1:19:58] with william branham
[1:20:04] i am not going to perform a wedding
[1:20:07] and play his tape of a wedding ceremony
[1:20:10] and say now he's marrying you it's not
[1:20:13] really me brother branham is here
[1:20:15] marrying you
[1:20:16] that is antichrist
[1:20:20] we're not this this friday we're not
[1:20:22] going to have a communion service where
[1:20:25] i push play and tell you william branham
[1:20:28] is standing here serving you communion
[1:20:31] that's not true
[1:20:33] [Music]
[1:20:33] [Applause]
[1:20:35] that's not true
[1:20:37] see
[1:20:38] and it's sad that you have to preach
[1:20:40] that
[1:20:42] the true church of god does not elevate
[1:20:44] its ministers or even its messengers or
[1:20:47] even its prophet of the age to the level
[1:20:50] of the lord jesus christ there is one
[1:20:53] supreme being who is among us and that
[1:20:57] is the lord
[1:20:59] jesus christ
[1:21:03] there is no other supreme being walking
[1:21:06] up and down these aisles trying to have
[1:21:08] intercession with you
[1:21:10] but he's trying
[1:21:12] he wants intercession he wants to be
[1:21:14] your intercessor he wants to be your all
[1:21:16] he wants to change your nature
[1:21:21] the true church of god gathers to
[1:21:24] fellowship with christ alone
[1:21:26] by receiving his engrafting word
[1:21:31] in graft is just another form of graft
[1:21:33] it means to be added into you you've
[1:21:36] been added into the tree of life you've
[1:21:37] been grafted in hallelujah
[1:21:40] and it's christ that grafted you in and
[1:21:42] it's christ who's the who's the gardener
[1:21:46] i am the vine jesus said my father is
[1:21:48] the farmer
[1:21:50] the gardener the husbandman see
[1:21:57] just before
[1:21:59] the rapture
[1:22:00] how many believe we're close
[1:22:05] just before the rapture which would be
[1:22:07] now
[1:22:10] the church of god
[1:22:13] is the last connection
[1:22:16] the world will have on earth
[1:22:18] between sanity and insanity
[1:22:24] amen between refuge
[1:22:27] and harm
[1:22:28] i've got it highlighted so do you mind
[1:22:30] if i read that a second time
[1:22:32] just before the rapture
[1:22:35] the church of god this is the true ones
[1:22:37] what we're preaching on
[1:22:38] the church of god
[1:22:40] is the last connection the world will
[1:22:43] have on earth
[1:22:45] between sanity and insanity refuge or
[1:22:48] harm you are the last source of pure
[1:22:53] good you are the last source i'm not
[1:22:56] saying there's not other good that's not
[1:22:58] pure there's it's got some impurities in
[1:23:00] it man-made ideology but we realize that
[1:23:03] the the remnant are good people and are
[1:23:05] saved
[1:23:06] but but we're talking about
[1:23:08] pure leadership
[1:23:10] pure good you're you're the last pure
[1:23:14] source of leadership
[1:23:17] amen the world will ever see right
[1:23:19] before the rapture so just ask yourself
[1:23:22] how should you live
[1:23:24] amen
[1:23:25] isn't that an obvious question
[1:23:27] if you're going to be the last bastion
[1:23:28] of truth if you're going to be the last
[1:23:31] possible point the last contact between
[1:23:34] insanity and sanity wouldn't you want to
[1:23:36] conduct your life as close as you
[1:23:39] possibly can with all your heart and all
[1:23:41] your soul to love god and let that
[1:23:44] display through your life according to
[1:23:46] what according to the message that god
[1:23:48] sent to make you that last
[1:23:51] point of light
[1:23:55] you're the last source
[1:23:58] the last source
[1:24:00] i mean this is so heavy this is this is
[1:24:03] heavy before i i close i'm almost out of
[1:24:06] time under normal under regulation time
[1:24:10] but i i want to make this point because
[1:24:12] it's heavy on my heart
[1:24:13] you're the last source of healing and
[1:24:15] relief
[1:24:19] and the world
[1:24:21] outside of the church of god which is
[1:24:23] everybody else
[1:24:25] is hurting
[1:24:27] they're hurting
[1:24:29] they're hurting
[1:24:30] they're hurting from pain they're
[1:24:32] hurting from
[1:24:33] misinterpreted theology they're they're
[1:24:36] hurting from poor leadership
[1:24:38] and and preachers who told them for so
[1:24:40] long it didn't matter and they're
[1:24:41] finding out it does
[1:24:44] they were told that the gospel would
[1:24:46] bring peace that passes understanding
[1:24:47] but it never has
[1:24:49] and they don't know why
[1:24:51] and they're they're they're suffering
[1:24:53] disillusionment they're suffering you're
[1:24:55] the last place they can find
[1:24:58] what's in your heart and what you're
[1:25:00] storing in the mechanics of this word
[1:25:02] let the dynamics light that up
[1:25:06] take that to your family take take a
[1:25:08] message of of love and gentleness and
[1:25:12] kindness and take it to them because
[1:25:14] they're hurting they don't know they're
[1:25:15] walking in blindness you're the last
[1:25:17] light
[1:25:19] they will ever have
[1:25:21] see
[1:25:22] you're the last healing source you're
[1:25:24] the last hope right before the rapture
[1:25:28] you're the last
[1:25:29] connection point between heaven and
[1:25:31] earth
[1:25:33] is you
[1:25:35] why because you are
[1:25:37] the true church
[1:25:39] of god
[1:25:42] the last source of pure good the last
[1:25:44] source of pure leadership the last
[1:25:46] source of healing and relief see
[1:25:50] there's a kingdom order to everything
[1:25:52] that should operate in our lives and i'm
[1:25:54] gonna this is where i hope to pick up
[1:25:56] in part three
[1:25:58] there's a kingdom order

[1:26:16] kingdom order in god's word

[1:26:22] is to show the world right before it's
[1:26:24] too late he's trying to one last time
[1:26:26] show him the order of the kingdom
[1:26:28] and he's doing it in you and i do you
[1:26:31] see why and i'm not going to go any
[1:26:33] further than that but but can you see
[1:26:36] then friends

[1:27:09] yourself

[1:27:22] to just say i just i don't i you know i
[1:27:25] don't want to be around these people and
[1:27:27] i don't want to go to these functions
[1:27:29] and i don't want to do this and i don't
[1:27:31] want to be a part you know
[1:27:32] i mean if i think of the idea great but
[1:27:35] if i didn't think of it no i have
[1:27:36] anything to do with anything
[1:27:38] you're not allowed to be like that
[1:27:40] not and be the church of god

[1:27:45] you're part of a unified heritage of
[1:27:48] god's kingdom we're not islands to
[1:27:50] ourselves that's why we assemble

[1:28:08] me out of the kingdom no will it make
[1:28:10] brother jason not like me no

[1:28:17] mean it with all my heart i'll still
[1:28:18] pray for you i'll still try to help your
[1:28:20] family and help your children it doesn't

[1:28:46] an influence to above everybody i'm i'm
[1:28:49] telling your friends i love you all but
[1:28:51] i want to but my greatest desire is to
[1:28:52] influence my children and my
[1:28:53] grandchildren
[1:28:55] i'm sorry they're more special to me
[1:28:57] than you
[1:29:00] i'm sorry they can get away with
[1:29:01] anything and you can't
[1:29:07] they they
[1:29:09] they will tell you they don't always get
[1:29:11] away
[1:29:12] sometimes pablo takes them aside and we
[1:29:13] have to have a talk
[1:29:15] and i get my message of love across to
[1:29:18] them and what my expectation is i don't
[1:29:20] let them off the hook
[1:29:21] see
[1:29:22] and sometimes but but but listen friends
[1:29:27] the point of it is
[1:29:28] is there's a lot of things we're not
[1:29:30] allowed to do we do them anyway and i
[1:29:32] just want you to know
[1:29:34] there's a price for that
[1:29:36] there's a price for that
[1:29:38] see there's a price to pay when you do
[1:29:40] that
[1:29:42] people who
[1:29:43] who come to church part-time
[1:29:46] people who
[1:29:47] participate part people who pay their
[1:29:50] tithes part-time or never a time
[1:29:56] you know i i
[1:29:57] i shouldn't say that that's privileged
[1:29:59] information but let me i'm just going to
[1:30:01] say it again you listen from the
[1:30:03] youngest to the oldest you know what you
[1:30:05] should do you should pay your tithes and
[1:30:07] offerings
[1:30:08] now it's not enriching brother jason i'm
