[0:00] just instruct us and admonish us and
[0:03] correct us and encourage us
[0:05] the word has the ability to do all of
[0:08] that
[0:08] and it might do something different for
[0:10] you than it does to your neighbor but
[0:12] just say Lord whatever you want to say
[0:13] to me
[0:15] say it to me this morning I'm ready to
[0:17] receive it Zechariah Chapter 12 we'll
[0:19] just begin reading
[0:21] I want to speak to you this morning on
[0:23] the right expectation the right
[0:26] expectation Zechariah Chapter 12 and
[0:29] we'll just read
[0:30] a few verses here let's just let me let
[0:34] me pull it up here rather than just
[0:36] maybe get a little bit of context
[0:38] Zechariah Chapter 12. what is we're
[0:42] going to read verse 9 and verse 10 and
[0:44] 11 but I just want to pick up maybe a
[0:46] few verses before that let's start here
[0:49] with verse 7. the Lord also shall save
[0:52] the tents of Judah first but the glory
[0:56] of the House of David and the glory of
[0:58] the inhabitants of Jerusalem do not
[1:01] magnify themself against Judah in that
[1:04] day shall the Lord defend the
[1:07] inhabitants of Jerusalem and he that is
[1:11] feeble among them at that day shall be
[1:14] as David now that's a very profound
[1:18] verse I don't know if you ever caught
[1:20] that before I had it until last night
[1:22] just reading it and that day now what
[1:25] day is he speaking of this is the day of
[1:27] the Lord
[1:29] it's not the day of the astronaut it's
[1:31] not the day of the horse and buggy it's
[1:34] not the day of the tank
[1:36] or the nuclear bomb
[1:38] there's a day for that this is now the
[1:40] day of the Lord so we're fast forwarding
[1:43] on the timeline for the Lord to have his
[1:46] day and when the day of the Lord comes
[1:48] you better have the Lord
[1:50] amen and if you don't have him now you
[1:53] won't have him then
[1:54] the day of the Lord so notice in that
[1:56] day this is I'm preaching to you this
[1:58] morning on the right expectation
[2:02] now brother Branham used Israel as God's
[2:05] timepiece and many people look at Israel
[2:07] and we watched uh all we're always keen
[2:10] on on that as Believers what's happening
[2:14] in current events what's happening in
[2:15] the news what's happening with Russia
[2:17] what's happening with Rome what's
[2:19] happening with Israel always Keen as a
[2:22] Believer you're always Keen in on that
[2:25] there's a reason there's a good reason
[2:26] for that but many people if you could
[2:29] say what happens next what is the right
[2:32] expectation of what is going to happen
[2:35] next for Israel some are looking for a
[2:38] temple others looking for a red heifer
[2:40] others are looking for the temple to be
[2:42] restored others are looking for the
[2:44] Feast of Passover or the Feast of
[2:47] Tabernacles but this is what the Bible
[2:49] says is next this is what's next for
[2:54] Israel it's not a Revival yet because
[2:58] they're in sin
[3:00] the Bible says that God for the sake of
[3:02] us has blinded their eyes right
[3:05] but the Bible says that the next thing
[3:07] for Israel before God opens their eyes
[3:10] they're going to receive the baptism of
[3:12] the Holy Ghost the prophet said just
[3:14] like you receive it they'll receive the
[3:17] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[3:18] the the spirit of of God by the Holy
[3:21] Ghost fell in Jerusalem one time and
[3:24] people spoke in tongues and prophesied
[3:26] that won't be the only time that the
[3:28] spirit of God pours out in the city of
[3:30] Jerusalem there's actually another
[3:32] pouring out of that spirit that the
[3:34] Bible prophesies but this time it'll be
[3:36] to the Jews
[3:38] now notice what's next though what's
[3:41] next and it may be
[3:43] not what you what they would want to
[3:45] hear maybe it's depressing to think
[3:47] about but the next event for Israel is
[3:50] an international Army an international
[3:54] United Nations that the entire all the
[3:58] nations of the earth will Encompass and
[4:02] Surround Jerusalem and they'll actually
[4:05] destroy the city they'll ravish the
[4:07] women they'll murder the children
[4:08] they'll murder that we're about to read
[4:10] it here in a moment that's what's next
[4:13] on Israel's timeline so it's not a if
[4:17] you would say what's next is on the
[4:18] horizon is something you know with
[4:20] fireworks and great grand things but
[4:23] actually what's next is very Bleak what
[4:26] the scripture records in Zachariah
[4:27] Zachariah was one of the Minor Prophets
[4:30] but it's the most important book for
[4:33] believers Gentile Believers to look at
[4:36] when you're looking at Zion or Israel's
[4:39] prophecy where they're at in Prophecy
[4:44] notice here in verse 6 and that day will
[4:46] I make the governors of Judah let's
[4:48] let's look at this let me make sure
[4:49] let's pick it up from verse 8. in that
[4:52] day shall the Lord defend the
[4:55] inhabitants of Jerusalem and he that is
[4:58] feeble among them
[4:59] so all those that are discouraged and
[5:02] you can imagine there would be great
[5:03] discouragement after this ransacking of
[5:06] the city after this besieging of the
[5:09] city and after all of the destruction
[5:11] and all of the all of the Bloodshed
[5:14] everyone's going to be downcast you can
[5:16] imagine depressed you can imagine out
[5:18] out of it really but the Bible says that
[5:21] in that day he that is feeble among them
[5:24] shall be as David
[5:27] so a spirit or an anointing will come
[5:30] upon the Jews that will be the same
[5:32] anointing of a warrior
[5:35] as David incredible and the House of
[5:39] David that means his descendants when
[5:41] you read that that means his lineage his
[5:42] line the House of David
[5:47] shall be as God and the angel of the
[5:50] Lord before them verse 9 and it shall
[5:53] come to pass in that day that I will
[5:55] seek to destroy all the nations that
[5:59] come against Jerusalem
[6:01] and I will pour upon the House of David
[6:03] now here you read these words it's the
[6:06] same thing you read in Joel I know you
[6:07] have you standing to stay with me for a
[6:09] moment and Joe you have in in that in
[6:12] the in in the prophecy in the Book of
[6:14] Joel that I will pour my spirit out upon
[6:16] All Flesh your sons and your daughters
[6:18] will prophesy your old mental dream
[6:20] dreams your young mental see Visions you
[6:22] know that scripture
[6:23] so that's referencing what happened in
[6:26] the upper room in the book of in the
[6:28] book of Acts but this is a different
[6:30] reference he's pouring out his Spirit
[6:31] notice and I will pour upon the House of
[6:34] David and upon the inhabitants of
[6:37] Jerusalem the spirit of Grace
[6:41] they're going to need it
[6:43] they're going to need it this is a
[6:45] stubborn and rebellious people they're
[6:48] going to need a spirit of Grace
[6:52] say brother Matt why is that important
[6:54] because as we live in our lives we type
[6:57] where Israel is at as a gentile Church
[7:00] so what's going to be poured upon the
[7:03] bride before the body change a spirit of
[7:06] Grace
[7:07] and let me just say I'm going to need it
[7:11] how many could say I'm going to need it
[7:12] Lord a spirit of Grace and supplications
[7:16] that's prayer and they shall look upon
[7:18] me whom they have pierced and they shall
[7:20] mourn for him as one mourneth for his
[7:22] only son and shall be in bitterness for
[7:25] him as one that is in bitterness for his
[7:28] firstborn in that day there shall be
[7:30] great mourning in Jerusalem
[7:32] let's just bow our heads and pray Lord
[7:34] we we're so thankful Lord
[7:36] that we have something that we could
[7:38] look to that's so real
[7:40] Lord not Lord just a figment of
[7:43] someone's imagination or uh Lord a
[7:45] historical record of something that
[7:48] someone told us but we have that Living
[7:50] Word that's proven yourself alive
[7:54] Lord after your Lord by infallible
[7:56] proofs Lord You've proven yourself alive
[7:58] amongst your people we're so glad Lord
[8:01] that we can look to your word this
[8:02] morning and we can have confidence in
[8:04] what we read we could have confidence in
[8:07] how we live Lord I pray God that you
[8:09] would come and make this word real to
[8:11] every person that's here Lord those that
[8:13] are not present I pray that you bless
[8:15] our pastor Lord as he's away ministering
[8:17] now in Virginia she's maybe even now
[8:19] going to the pulpit I pray God you would
[8:21] anoint him with your spirit Lord we ask
[8:24] it now in Jesus Christ's name and the
[8:26] church said
[8:27] amen you can be seated this morning
[8:32] I'm just going to reference something
[8:34] brother Brandon I didn't put it on the
[8:36] PowerPoint so you just have to listen
[8:38] he's speaking about a trip that he took
[8:40] uh to Glacier
[8:43] uh National Park and he goes there with
[8:45] his wife and his children and they
[8:47] announce that there's going to be a a
[8:49] fire show that they're going to light
[8:51] the glacier uh with lights and it's uh
[8:54] with fire and brother Brandon was there
[8:56] with his wife and with his children and
[8:58] he's asking am I going to see it they're
[8:59] they're hiking all day in Glacier and he
[9:02] and he asks you know when the show is
[9:03] going to happen and they're wanting
[9:05] they're busy trying to that's they're
[9:06] eager about it wanting to see this to
[9:08] make sure that they don't miss it and he
[9:11] speaks about this in the invisible Union
[9:12] and he talks about how he goes up to the
[9:14] park ranger and he's or the men who's
[9:16] preparing and he says you know what time
[9:18] is it going to be and and well you know
[9:20] is it going to happen and they say yeah
[9:22] it's going to happen where uh you know
[9:24] we're going to do it we do it about
[9:26] every time this summer and and so they
[9:28] brother Brandon keeps going back and
[9:29] they don't they want to make sure that
[9:31] they don't miss it they're going to be
[9:32] hiking in the wilderness and want to
[9:33] make sure that they're there when it
[9:35] happens so he continues to ask uh what
[9:38] you know what time is it going to be and
[9:39] the man keeps telling him uh we we're
[9:41] promised we promised that we're gonna do
[9:43] it listen to what brother Brandon says
[9:45] here the man says said we promised it
[9:47] tonight we promised it the men are up
[9:50] there right now they're getting it ready
[9:52] now
[9:53] after all that had been made ready for
[9:56] the event listen that's what's taking
[9:58] place right now
[10:01] all is being made ready for the event
[10:05] a church being pulled out for his
[10:08] namesake taking his bride out from among
[10:10] the world these denominations and all
[10:13] the world and all the filth of the
[10:15] things of the world notice this is
[10:17] what's happening right now brother
[10:19] Brandon begins to to catch something
[10:21] here that has the expectation of his
[10:24] family was to see this and there was
[10:26] people preparing it and he stops and
[10:28] this is in the invisible Union and said
[10:29] that's what's taking place right now now
[10:32] you may not see it you may not hear it
[10:35] you may be living your every single day
[10:37] life but as Jacob falls asleep and sees
[10:40] Angels descending and ascending and the
[10:43] Bible says in god Jehovah was over at
[10:45] all what was God showing Jacob that
[10:48] though you may not feel it there's a
[10:50] plan and a purpose that's constantly
[10:53] being worked at
[10:55] whether you feel it or not
[10:57] God is never sleeping he's always busy
[11:03] brother Adam says after all that he then
[11:05] he says that's what's taking place all
[11:06] is being made ready everybody the event
[11:09] Was Made ready everybody was standing
[11:11] out there they said now keep watching
[11:13] keep watching look up there right on top
[11:15] of the mountain now notice all was ready
[11:18] everything had been kindled and made
[11:20] ready and everybody was standing out I
[11:22] had my head sticking up my arm around my
[11:25] wife we was looking watching he's there
[11:27] watching the mountain telling his
[11:28] children keep your eye on that mountain
[11:30] Don't Take Your Eye Off of it but Daddy
[11:32] it's not nothing's happening just keep
[11:34] watching it something's about to take
[11:35] place they're about to light the glaze
[11:38] the mountain on fire and and he says
[11:40] they're all there everything's been
[11:41] prepared everything's ready it's all
[11:43] been kindled everyone was standing there
[11:45] he says we was looking children standing
[11:47] there all of us looking like that my it
[11:49] was something because we was expecting
[11:52] it because it was promised to us
[11:58] and all at once we heard something from
[12:01] the top of the hill a voice come down
[12:03] through the loudspeaker all things are
[12:06] ready now
[12:07] then this man standing there right
[12:09] beside me said Let the Fire Fall
[12:12] here it come pouring down across the
[12:15] mountain a glacier of fire and blazing
[12:17] licking oh it was a sight to behold
[12:19] brother let's get all these things ready
[12:22] for one of these days the fire is going
[12:25] to fall
[12:26] we're going up you believe that now
[12:29] let's get ready for the fire falling
[12:31] time we're in the last days we all know
[12:33] that and we're ready for the coming of
[12:37] the Lord
[12:38] the thing to do now is separate yourself
[12:41] from all sin separate yourself from
[12:45] anything that pertains to the world
[12:47] don't love the things of don't love the
[12:49] world or the things of the world what
[12:51] was it there was an expectation and it's
[12:54] so important that you have the right
[12:58] expectation
[13:03] you could monitor survey anybody in the
[13:05] world today no matter what nation that
[13:08] you would go to they would be living for
[13:10] a certain expectation that would be
[13:12] living for a certain future
[13:14] and that's their motivation that's what
[13:17] drives them that's what determines where
[13:19] they live how they live uh what how
[13:21] they're going what they're going to be
[13:23] how they'll dress how they'll act how
[13:25] they'll live it's based upon the
[13:27] expectation that they have
[13:30] when you came to church today you had an
[13:32] expectation brother Brandon said this
[13:34] way you'll get whatever you expect
[13:38] you'll get whatever you expect whatever
[13:41] you put in is what you're going to get
[13:43] out
[13:45] this was a water cup here and we had
[13:47] poured half of it I could only expect to
[13:49] get half of it out because that's all
[13:52] that I put in thank you
[13:54] when you come to the house of God if all
[13:56] you put in is a little half glass that's
[13:58] about all you're going to get
[14:00] but if you pour all of yourself into
[14:02] your expectation are you following me
[14:05] this morning
[14:06] brother man says that was the
[14:08] expectation that they they were living
[14:10] under this expectation so notice what I
[14:14] just want to go through this and this is
[14:16] going to be I want you to have all of
[14:17] this took a lot of time if you have that
[14:19] PowerPoint brother Josh go ahead and put
[14:21] it up took a lot of time to prepare this
[14:23] so I want you just to if I don't get
[14:26] anywhere this morning the Lord is so
[14:30] constrain my heart
[14:32] for this Sunday morning message to get
[14:35] this I have a lot the Lord wants me to
[14:37] get to but if we don't get to anything
[14:38] let me just say this is the main event
[14:42] listen to what brother Branham starts to
[14:44] speak about about expectations or about
[14:47] what's let me let me say it this way
[14:49] what is Promised because he gives the
[14:52] story the example of the men and he says
[14:54] we were in expectation of it because God
[14:57] had promised it so then you say what
[15:00] what are we an expectation of well we're
[15:03] an expectation of whatever was promised
[15:06] to us
[15:07] and I want to say I want everything that
[15:10] was promised to me I want to claim all
[15:12] of it
[15:13] you say brother Matt what is promised to
[15:16] the to the elected what is promise and
[15:18] this is just a brief study if you ever
[15:21] want a very good resource brother gerd
[15:25] roadwald in Germany created an archive
[15:27] that a brother put together you could
[15:28] find it called spiritual building Stones
[15:31] I pulled this directly from that it's
[15:33] just so so wonderful listen to some of
[15:35] these
[15:36] were promised in this last day this is
[15:39] this is um the marriage of the bride and
[15:42] I didn't put I put the quote what where
[15:44] I'm reading this from right underneath
[15:46] it this is out of proving his word so
[15:48] what is Promised in this day or in this
[15:51] hour or in this generation what's
[15:53] promised is the marriage of the Bride to
[15:57] the lamb
[15:59] that was promised in this day
[16:02] listen
[16:03] prophet of God says Jesus says As it was
[16:05] in the days of Sodom and I have here in
[16:07] Luke these are not in the quote uh these
[16:10] are actually just where we've inserted
[16:11] them in Red so that if you want a
[16:13] Biblical reference you can go back and
[16:15] find it as it was in the days of Sodom
[16:17] now watch close in the days of Sodom so
[16:19] it will be at the coming of the son of
[16:21] man when the son of man is being
[16:22] revealed no he says not no more as a
[16:26] church not no more the brides called
[16:31] in that day the son of man will be
[16:33] revealed what to join the church to the
[16:37] Head unite the marriage of the Bride now
[16:41] I'm reading you you could use thousands
[16:43] of quotes but I'm reading you things
[16:45] that are specific that are promised in
[16:49] the message to you
[16:52] and I want it if it's for me I want it
[16:55] and I want to make sure I don't miss it
[16:57] and he says to join the church the
[17:00] marriage of the Bride the bridegroom
[17:01] call will come right through this when
[17:04] the son of man will come down first
[17:06] Thessalonians 4 the Lord himself shall
[17:09] descend with a shout with the voice with
[17:11] the trumpet and come in human flesh to
[17:16] unite the two together
[17:18] the church has has to be the word he is
[17:22] the word and the two unites together and
[17:26] to do that it'll take the manifestation
[17:28] of the revealing of the son of man not a
[17:31] clergy man I don't know do you see what
[17:33] I mean so see it's son of man Jesus
[17:37] Christ will come down in human flesh
[17:42] Among Us
[17:45] and will make his word so real
[17:49] then it'll unite the church and him as
[17:52] one
[17:54] this is why the prophet's Ministry was
[17:58] so thoroughly Vindicated God didn't have
[18:02] to do that God could have sent one sign
[18:04] and that would have been enough to catch
[18:06] the elected to get their attention
[18:08] remember it's not the sign that you're
[18:10] connected to
[18:11] it's not the sign that we're that we're
[18:14] connected to the sign was sent to get
[18:16] your attention it's the word that you're
[18:18] magnetized to
[18:20] Jesus says there's that an adulterous
[18:23] generation seeks after a sign remember
[18:26] when the Pharisees came to him and he's
[18:28] eating corn and they get upset and they
[18:30] say Jesus says uh you know begins to
[18:33] quote them from David and the but Jesus
[18:35] stops and says they said show us a sign
[18:37] and Jesus says an adulteress and a
[18:41] wicked generation seeketh after a son
[18:45] so let's not be sign Seekers
[18:48] you say why brother Matt because Jesus
[18:50] said it was an adulterous and wicked
[18:52] generation that seeks after a sign
[18:57] signs brother Branham says we don't seek
[18:59] after signs signs follow us
[19:03] it's it's a it's a very important
[19:06] distinction
[19:08] and he says there shall be no sign given
[19:10] unto it except the sign of Jonas now
[19:13] notice who is three days in the belly
[19:15] the entire picture you see here in the
[19:18] Bible is that the sign they were looking
[19:20] for was standing right in front of them
[19:24] and they missed it it went right over
[19:26] their head the sign that you're looking
[19:28] for is right in front of them notice
[19:29] he'll come down Jesus Christ will come
[19:33] down in human flesh and will make his
[19:36] word so real that it will unite the
[19:38] church in him as one the bride and then
[19:41] shall go home to the wedding supper
[19:44] so where do we go when we go when we
[19:46] meet the Lord in the air when we go
[19:48] we're not going to a marriage we're
[19:50] going to a supper
[19:51] so where does the marriage take place
[19:53] right now
[19:55] right now God's uniting his word with
[19:59] the word that's inside of you
[20:02] and if you don't have the seed the word
[20:04] of God inside of you it'll never take
[20:06] it'll never Unite it'll intellectually
[20:09] agree but it will never Unite with the
[20:11] word because brother random says what is
[20:13] it you when you heard the message
[20:15] he says you recognize that it is Eagle
[20:18] food you heard from your theophany
[20:22] so there was something already inside of
[20:24] you that was part of what you heard and
[20:26] it connected when you heard it
[20:29] listen the bride and then she'll go home
[20:31] she's already united we go to the
[20:33] wedding supper not to the marriage but
[20:35] the Rapture is going to the wedding
[20:37] supper when the word here unites with
[20:40] the person and they too become one and
[20:42] then what does it do then it manifests
[20:46] the son of man again not the church
[20:50] theologians the son of man the word in
[20:52] the church becomes one whatever the son
[20:56] of man done he was the word the church
[20:58] does the same thing now we're speaking
[21:02] on the right expectations I believe
[21:04] expectations are so important you get
[21:08] what you expect and it's important that
[21:10] we set the right expectation as
[21:14] ministers as people as the family of God
[21:16] as parents we set the right expectations
[21:19] because if you're not expecting
[21:21] something it'll never come to you
[21:23] Jesus says he'll appear to those who are
[21:26] looking for him so if you're not looking
[21:28] for him or you're looking for the wrong
[21:30] thing you'll never see him you miss it
[21:31] entirely so I want to say Lord let me
[21:33] make sure I'm looking for the right
[21:35] thing about my expectation to be
[21:38] expecting the right thing
[21:41] and he says the church becomes one
[21:42] whatever the son of man does the church
[21:44] does the same thing Revelation is 19.
[21:46] here's another promise
[21:48] the son of man back in the church again
[21:50] this is the Mighty God unveiled before
[21:52] us in 1964. the son of man back in the
[21:57] church again
[21:58] revealed in human beings
[22:02] huh
[22:05] that's powerful
[22:07] the son of man back in the church
[22:10] revealed in human beings
[22:14] not the Son of God but the son of man
[22:17] again back in his church again in the
[22:21] last days
[22:22] we find that he promised that it that in
[22:26] God's promises and we find out here that
[22:28] God has always had skin on him when
[22:31] Moses seen him he had skin on him looked
[22:33] like a man when God was behind the
[22:35] curtains he had skin on him and God
[22:37] tonight in his church is veiled in his
[22:41] church with skin on him
[22:43] he's still the same God tonight we find
[22:46] that but now as ever the skin Veil is
[22:49] what catches the Traditions they just
[22:51] can't believe that that's god making
[22:53] them people act like that it's because
[22:55] God's veiled in his church in skin skin
[22:59] on it
[23:01] that's right he's hid from the
[23:03] unbeliever and revealed to the believer
[23:08] now when their traditionville of the
[23:10] elders and the word is broke through oh
[23:12] of course today notice when their
[23:15] tradition view of the elders
[23:19] and the word is broke through so when
[23:21] you remove the religious Veil when you
[23:24] remove the tradition Veil when you
[23:26] remove well that's not how my church did
[23:28] it well that's not how I was raised well
[23:30] that's not what I think when you get
[23:32] past all of that
[23:34] then comes in plain view we see him
[23:38] deity again veiled in human flesh
[23:42] Hebrew said so and also Genesis 18 18
[23:45] you remember God was a man standing
[23:47] there eating and talking with Abraham
[23:49] told him what Sarah was doing in the
[23:51] tent behind and Jesus says As it was in
[23:53] the days of Sodom so shall it be at the
[23:55] coming of the son of man deity veiled
[23:58] again in human flesh now remember Jesus
[24:01] didn't say when the son of man is the
[24:02] Son of God is being revealed and Luke
[24:04] the 17th chapter 30th verse he said when
[24:08] the son of man is being revealed the son
[24:11] of man back in the church again revealed
[24:14] in human beings
[24:16] not Son of God
[24:18] but the son of man again notice brother
[24:21] Brandon gives this pattern and he says
[24:23] you'll always notice that religion has
[24:25] always been one step behind they've
[24:29] always missed it and been blind to it
[24:31] because of a traditional veil of what
[24:34] they thought about God or how they
[24:36] thought he would appear when he was
[24:38] Jehovah they didn't recognize him when
[24:40] he was tabernacled in the Tabernacle of
[24:43] Moses only a small little group
[24:44] recognized who he was the rest of the
[24:47] world went on living their lives raising
[24:49] children planting Farms building houses
[24:51] and they missed they failed to recognize
[24:55] the word or the anointed word or the
[24:58] anointed form of the word of their
[25:01] generation they missed it in Jehovah but
[25:03] notice when Jesus appears they accept
[25:07] Jehovah
[25:08] but they miss Jesus
[25:11] they're always one step behind Now They
[25:14] didn't accept Jehovah now now that now
[25:17] they can see God in the scroll they can
[25:19] see God in the law
[25:20] but they missed it the word had been had
[25:23] moved
[25:24] and now remember the law was just a
[25:27] shadow
[25:30] the law was just a shadow so what is a
[25:32] shatter you can see Shadows really good
[25:33] here this morning you see Shadows on
[25:35] that back wall right there see that
[25:37] shadow this was the law but you know
[25:39] what happened when Jesus came Jesus was
[25:42] the object of The Shadow
[25:46] and to reject the object and to stay in
[25:49] the shadow was death
[25:50] you had to come out of the Shadow and
[25:53] accept the object that the shadow was
[25:55] reflecting
[25:57] so they missed Christ the anointed word
[26:00] but now look at the world we live in
[26:02] today oh man everybody loves Jesus now
[26:05] that now the out of his bodily form now
[26:07] that he's not Jesus of Nazareth anymore
[26:09] walking the swords of Galilee
[26:10] everybody's got a Bible everybody's got
[26:12] a cross on their window everybody
[26:14] everybody's Christians now
[26:17] but they reject the son of man that was
[26:19] revealed through a prophet
[26:21] they missed the anointed word they're
[26:24] always tradition always blinds people
[26:27] religion always blinds people they miss
[26:30] it they couldn't see the pro they
[26:32] couldn't see that the word had been made
[26:34] flesh again
[26:37] you see men always have trouble brother
[26:39] Brandon said it this way man never has
[26:41] trouble except in a god of History
[26:44] he always struggles when you bring that
[26:46] God out of history and you bring him
[26:49] present tense
[26:52] and so they they miss they reject the
[26:55] word they reject the anointed word what
[26:57] word is brother random say in here the
[26:59] word in flesh again Jesus didn't say he
[27:01] says the son of man back in the church
[27:03] again revealed in human beings not Son
[27:05] of God but son of man back in his church
[27:07] we find that he promised that it's God's
[27:09] promise we notice another thing in the
[27:11] old Badger skins what did it do it hid
[27:13] the glory of God from the people the
[27:15] reason that people couldn't see it
[27:17] because it was a skin that held it he's
[27:20] speaking of the Tabernacle and behind
[27:22] the badger skin was the pre was the
[27:24] Shekinah Glory the glory of God was
[27:27] behind the skin and now the glory of God
[27:31] is behind your skin
[27:36] do you notice what happens with your
[27:38] faith oh we're preaching about the
[27:40] Shekinah Glory in the Old Testament oh I
[27:41] believe it preaching about the glory
[27:43] revealed in Jesus oh I believe it even
[27:45] today preaching about the glory revealed
[27:47] in God's Prophet oh I believe it but now
[27:49] the glory has moved and it's revealed or
[27:52] wants to reveal himself through your
[27:55] skin
[27:57] I say Lord reveal yourself let me get
[28:00] out of the way and let yourself be
[28:03] translated let yourself be projected
[28:05] through my life
[28:07] and the Traditions don't see it it's
[28:11] inside the veil where the word was it's
[28:14] inside the veil where the word was lost
[28:17] control there we go the son of man is
[28:20] Christ he's the one you're feeding on
[28:24] you're not feeding on a man listen if
[28:26] you read the message of the hour and you
[28:28] just think you're reading the words of
[28:30] William Branham you will get nothing
[28:32] from any Eternal benefit at all
[28:36] if you think you're just reading the
[28:38] words of the man you'll receive nothing
[28:40] but when you can receive it as the voice
[28:44] behind The Voice
[28:46] and that it's God tabernacled in a man
[28:49] that we don't worship the man
[28:51] but the the voice of God tabernacled
[28:54] through his mouthpiece
[28:56] when you view it that way God can speak
[28:59] to you through that man
[29:01] and if you don't all you get is hunting
[29:02] stories and fishing stories and
[29:04] traditions and doctrines and three one
[29:06] God instead of three an original sin was
[29:08] adultery it wasn't an app all those
[29:10] things are true
[29:11] but when you move Beyond it and you get
[29:14] beyond the badger skin and you see the
[29:17] glory of God then you recognize your day
[29:20] and its message
[29:21] the son of man is Christ he's the one
[29:24] you're feeding on you're not feeding on
[29:27] a man a man his words will fail but
[29:30] you're feeding on the unfailing body
[29:33] word
[29:34] of the son of man
[29:37] so they missed it and
[29:41] Generation Now people have
[29:43] recognized the glory
[29:45] that people have recognized the voice
[29:47] behind the voice they have accepted the
[29:49] messenger but now they reject the
[29:52] anointed word of that message living
[29:55] behind people
[29:57] do you follow that
[30:00] notice what brother random says this is
[30:02] another promise this was a promise for
[30:04] this generation the entire Holy Spirit
[30:07] visits the church
[30:09] do you know that's a promise for 2000
[30:12] for 2022.
[30:15] I should have got uh every voice that's
[30:18] in here to say Amen do you know that's a
[30:21] promise why is that important because if
[30:24] you're not if you don't realize that's a
[30:26] promise you won't expect this
[30:28] but when you read that this is your
[30:30] promise
[30:32] then you expect that the entire Holy
[30:34] Spirit notice and now the entire this is
[30:38] desperations 1963 in September the
[30:41] entire Holy Spirit visits the church
[30:45] making God in human flesh as he did
[30:50] before Sodom the burning bush there was
[30:52] which was a type the Holy Spirit has
[30:55] been bound by these denominational
[30:57] Rivers for almost 2 000 years but it's
[31:01] to be loosed in the evening time by the
[31:03] evening time message the Holy Spirit
[31:06] back in the church again Christ himself
[31:11] revealed there it is again in human
[31:13] flesh
[31:15] in the evening time
[31:18] why did Brother Branham turn his back to
[31:20] the audience
[31:22] and then begin to discern people with
[31:24] his back turn what was it it was a sign
[31:27] of the same God the same Melchizedek
[31:30] that met Abraham had now returned back
[31:34] to a people again
[31:37] it was significant
[31:39] notice in human flesh he said he
[31:41] promised it this is another promise for
[31:44] your generation that we're coming to
[31:45] perfection
[31:47] now I know a lot of y'all don't feel
[31:48] perfect this morning but it's got to be
[31:51] your expectation notice it's not what
[31:54] you're presently living it's not where
[31:55] you're presently at stop looking at your
[31:58] present and look at your promise stop
[32:01] looking at what you see and set your
[32:03] goal on what God has promised and say
[32:06] Lord I may not be here but I believe I'm
[32:08] going to confess you're bringing me to
[32:11] this
[32:13] this is perfect faith we are coming now
[32:16] to Perfection because the people have to
[32:18] come to this in order for the Rapture
[32:20] did you hear that
[32:22] we're coming to perfect to we're coming
[32:26] to Perfection because the people how
[32:29] many is the people
[32:30] have to come to this
[32:33] in order for the rapture
[32:36] that's what's holding it away right now
[32:42] waiting for the church to come into that
[32:46] perfect raptured faith
[32:50] it's a perfect place
[32:53] calling you to that Perfection and you
[32:57] have to be perfect to get there
[33:03] notice the Bible said so Jesus said be
[33:05] therefore perfect even as your father in
[33:07] Heaven is perfect not a faith but a
[33:11] perfect Faith Build It Up in here and
[33:15] watch a perfect god with a perfect heart
[33:19] keep a perfect promise
[33:22] by his perfect word
[33:26] I want you to key it on that word
[33:27] perfect heart because it doesn't mean
[33:30] you're a perfect person
[33:32] doesn't mean remember Sister Bruce
[33:34] brother Brandon but I make so many
[33:35] mistakes God doesn't look at your
[33:37] mistakes Mr Bruce he looks at what's in
[33:40] your heart
[33:43] and a person who really has that you say
[33:45] brother Matt you can't preach that
[33:46] because then people will say well I I
[33:48] don't live right but it's in my heart no
[33:49] no no no a real believer who really has
[33:52] it in their heart will live every day
[33:55] striving and struggling and fighting if
[33:58] they have to call their way to it they
[34:00] may be down in the dirt and down in the
[34:02] dumps but there's something inside of
[34:04] them saying Lord perfect me Lord change
[34:07] me Lord for forgive me Lord change me
[34:10] Lord move me Lord grow me mature me
[34:14] watch a perfect heart with a perfect
[34:16] Promise by his perfect word
[34:18] them who lived back there was not
[34:20] perfect until this church this is the
[34:22] Old Testament Saints this is all of
[34:24] those who have fallen asleep remember
[34:26] they're not dead they just have fallen
[34:28] asleep
[34:30] all of them that have fallen asleep he
[34:32] says them who live back there was not
[34:34] perfect until this church
[34:37] be perfected the bride group and the
[34:40] last days to bring them in and all
[34:42] together be taken up and we do have
[34:46] today by God's help the perfect
[34:49] interpretation of the word
[34:52] by Divine vindication
[34:57] the promise for this for for the day and
[34:59] age this is one you can take a hold of a
[35:01] lot of rain poured out upon the people
[35:03] in the last days this is 1964 the Mighty
[35:07] God unveiled before us I think the Greek
[35:09] word is Keynotes which means that he
[35:12] emptied himself out not in the way we
[35:14] would say like something was inside of
[35:15] somebody that had emptied out but he
[35:18] poured
[35:19] himself
[35:22] remember not a gift gifts are wonderful
[35:24] thank God for the gifts
[35:26] but now it's not the gift that you
[35:29] receive it's The Giver
[35:33] it's not the Revival that you're part of
[35:36] that you meet I love the Revival but I
[35:38] met the reviver
[35:41] Hallelujah and he says he says he
[35:44] emptied himself himself he changed in
[35:47] more faith he changed from what he was
[35:49] to what he is he never changes his
[35:51] nature that is he changed himself he
[35:55] poured himself into another mask into
[35:58] another form not another person went out
[36:01] of him called the Holy Spirit he says
[36:03] not another person went at him call the
[36:04] Holy Spirit but it was he himself you
[36:06] get that
[36:07] he himself poured himself into the
[36:11] prophet
[36:15] into the people
[36:18] Christ
[36:20] in you
[36:21] Colossians 1.
[36:24] Christ in you
[36:25] how beautiful how wonderful to think God
[36:27] poured himself into the human being into
[36:29] the believer pour out it was a part of
[36:31] his drama to do so it was a part of his
[36:35] drama remember when you don't see the
[36:38] Bible as a historical history but you
[36:41] see this as his story
[36:44] that it's a drama that's being played
[36:46] out and you're a you're a player you're
[36:48] an actor in this drama
[36:51] you say My Little Life That's brother
[36:53] Matt you don't even understand I I'm
[36:55] just a I'm just a little nobody I don't
[36:58] have any part I don't play really any
[36:59] role I I struggle if you've seen my
[37:02] daily I might look good dressed up nice
[37:04] have my tie buttoned up on Sunday and
[37:06] and everybody thinks I got it all
[37:08] together but boy you should see me on
[37:10] Monday morning and traffic you should
[37:12] see me on Tuesday at work you should see
[37:14] me Wednesday night when we're trying to
[37:16] get ready for church you should see our
[37:18] children you should see our home but
[37:20] surely not I couldn't be God says I've
[37:23] designed and interwoven all of those
[37:26] parts of your life and all of those
[37:28] parts are part of the Great drama that
[37:31] I'm gonna take a people that's so messed
[37:34] up and so far away and so distant but
[37:37] I'm gonna bring them unto myself I'm
[37:39] going to take Fallen humanity and I'm
[37:41] going to put my life inside of them and
[37:43] bring them to Perfection of the word
[37:47] I say be it unto me as Mary said
[37:49] according to your word Lord
[37:51] be it unto me he says it's part of his
[37:54] drama to do so God all the fullness all
[37:56] that God had bodily was in this person
[37:58] Jesus Christ he was God and God Alone
[38:00] not a third person or a second person or
[38:03] a first person but the person
[38:05] God veiled in human flesh oh there will
[38:09] be a true informed listen there will be
[38:13] a true former and latter rain in the
[38:17] last days upon that little group
[38:23] that should be our expectation
[38:29] there will be a former and a latter rain
[38:32] upon that little group that come with
[38:36] him on this little donkey low and humble
[38:39] no doubt denomination crying he says no
[38:42] doubt or denomination crying Hosanna to
[38:45] the king that comes in the name of the
[38:48] Lord
[38:49] he says there will be a ladder rain and
[38:51] a form of rain that's poured out upon
[38:54] that little humble group what's the
[38:56] attraction on the mount what is it
[38:58] there's a former Reign a teaching rain
[39:00] but there's coming a ladder rain there's
[39:02] coming a sweep there's coming a dynamic
[39:05] they don't change you they don't take
[39:06] those things that you can't change and
[39:08] it'll change them there's coming a
[39:11] dynamic Revival you say what Revival is
[39:13] that going to be brother man if I'm not
[39:15] looking for it I'll never be a part of
[39:17] it but I want to set my expectation to
[39:19] say Lord I want everything that you have
[39:22] for me I want to be a recipient let me
[39:25] be a vessel that's empty of any of
[39:27] myself so that you can pour all of
[39:29] yourself
[39:31] and I can receive all of it Lord
[39:33] this was the promise notice one of the
[39:36] promises it's uniting time of God and
[39:38] his brother this is Christ The Mystery
[39:39] of God revealed Christ the true headship
[39:43] coming in his bride
[39:46] doing the same works that he did at the
[39:49] beginning the head and the body are
[39:53] becoming one in works and in sign and in
[39:58] life
[40:00] Vindicated by God himself through his
[40:03] promised word of the last days he
[40:05] promised this in the last days now if
[40:07] you're spiritual you'll catch it the
[40:11] headship and the body has become one
[40:14] unit it's God manifested in his people
[40:18] that's the reason the husband and wife
[40:20] is no longer Twain
[40:22] they are one
[40:24] God and his church is one Christ in you
[40:29] God's Great Revelation even bearing his
[40:34] name
[40:35] you see Churches United Nations United
[40:37] but it's a uniting time of God and his
[40:39] bride too now the promise the Dynamics
[40:42] of this church will be a refilling of
[40:46] the Holy Spirit it says 1963 what shall
[40:49] I do with Jesus called Christ the
[40:52] Dynamics of this church will be a
[40:54] refilling of the Holy Spirit
[40:57] notice that we have worked in a small
[41:01] measure
[41:03] I read that this morning and thought
[41:05] wait a minute
[41:07] the Dynamics of the church will be a
[41:11] refilling of what I've witnessed brother
[41:14] Branham work in a small measure
[41:18] so you mean when he spoke to Hattie
[41:20] right and he and brother Brandon says
[41:23] she said the right words and says that's
[41:24] nothing but the truth brother Bynum
[41:27] brother random says when she spoke those
[41:29] words it moved heaven
[41:31] and brother Brandon says an anointing
[41:33] dropped in that room and I said sister
[41:35] Hattie the Holy Spirit liked that you
[41:38] said that and anything you ask right now
[41:40] will be given to you
[41:43] and he said she could have asked for ten
[41:44] thousand dollars should have he asked
[41:46] for anything she asked for the Salvation
[41:47] of her two boys
[41:49] and it was given to her just like that
[41:52] now this is what the prophet says the
[41:54] Dynamics that's coming to this church
[41:57] and I don't want you to think of it as
[41:59] somewhere off in the misty blue it's
[42:01] happening right now
[42:04] it's happening right now
[42:08] whether whether I'm a part of it or not
[42:11] doesn't mean it's not happening whether
[42:14] I miss it entirely
[42:16] doesn't stop it from happening
[42:18] whether I'm off in in la la land
[42:21] something's happening right now
[42:24] I want to say Lord let me be a part of
[42:26] it don't let me miss it Lord don't let
[42:28] me miss it let my expectation oh how
[42:30] many hands would go up and say Lord
[42:32] don't let me miss it
[42:35] I don't want to miss it I want my
[42:36] expectation to be on the right thing the
[42:39] devil if he can do anything or get my my
[42:42] my expectation misaligned with something
[42:45] that it shouldn't be on what is my
[42:47] expectation
[42:48] that the Dynamics that are coming that
[42:51] are happening that are falling he says
[42:53] that we've worked in a small measure
[42:55] while The Headstone is coming down to
[42:57] unite with the body but when that head
[42:59] and body unites together the full
[43:01] somebody say fool the full power of the
[43:05] Holy Ghost would raise her up just
[43:07] exactly like that even the dead that's
[43:10] dead in Christ for hundreds of years
[43:12] will raise in the beauty of his Holiness
[43:15] and take a flight to the skies the
[43:18] Dynamics is the Holy Spirit the Dynamics
[43:22] there will come a sound from Heaven that
[43:25] will take such a baptism of the Holy
[43:27] Spirit into that bride it'll take her
[43:29] the bride from the earth and a rapturing
[43:32] Grace
[43:34] and to glory in the rapture
[43:37] God
[43:38] promised it
[43:42] this is one promise that's for you the
[43:44] body change
[43:46] and how many hurt and bodies said amen
[43:53] it's a promise
[43:55] if you're not expecting it
[43:57] if you're not looking for it
[43:59] the body changed let it off the pressure
[44:01] that next thing the next thing will be a
[44:04] sweep
[44:05] I don't know what that sweep will feel
[44:06] like but I can't wait for it to happen
[44:09] the next thing will be a
[44:13] imagine maybe you'll be at work maybe
[44:15] you'll be at home mopping your floors
[44:17] maybe you'll be in an office maybe
[44:18] that's what you do on a computer now
[44:20] you'll be maybe you'll be down on your
[44:22] knees maybe you'll be in a boat fishing
[44:23] I like to think that that's where I'll
[44:25] be
[44:26] all I know is brother Brandon says the
[44:28] next thing suddenly you're going through
[44:30] your normal life average life everyday
[44:32] living making plans for tomorrow
[44:34] planting your potatoes
[44:36] and then suddenly a sweep
[44:39] brother random says that little group
[44:42] together in a month or so
[44:45] should be gone
[44:48] and as soon as she's gathered together
[44:50] we're at the end there's no hope left
[44:52] nowhere
[44:54] and this is his admonition run to Christ
[44:56] people
[44:58] here's a promise the restoration end
[45:00] time evangelism I love this message 1962
[45:03] the end time evangelism this is a
[45:05] promise that's for you the restoration
[45:06] the end time message is to get the bride
[45:10] ready and prepared for the Rapture the
[45:12] end time message is to get the bride
[45:15] ready and prepared for a Rapture that's
[45:17] the end time message
[45:19] there's a lot of things that encompasses
[45:21] that there's a lot of things in that bag
[45:22] there's a lot of things in that treasure
[45:24] but here's the purpose of the end time
[45:26] message to get you ready to get out of
[45:29] this place to get your children ready to
[45:32] get out of this place because we're not
[45:34] leaving anybody behind we're not leaving
[45:36] children grandchildren small children
[45:38] old children
[45:41] we're not leaving any hoof Moses said
[45:43] we're not going to leave any of them for
[45:45] you we're taking everything that belongs
[45:48] to us
[45:49] why brother Matt cause it's a promise
[45:51] that God made
[45:54] the end time message is to get the bride
[45:56] ready and prepared for the Rapture what
[45:58] can it do according to Malachi 4 5 and 6
[46:01] is bringing them back to the faith that
[46:03] was once delivered to the Saints
[46:05] bring them back what restoration we
[46:07] speak about this all the time or the man
[46:09] I hear it over and over let me say this
[46:11] young people because some of you that
[46:13] are not uh children this this will be
[46:15] Elementary for you
[46:17] let me say it just to the young people
[46:18] what is the restoration I'll send Elijah
[46:22] the prophet and he shall restore he
[46:24] shall turn the hearts of the fathers
[46:26] back to the children and the Heart of
[46:27] the children back to the fathers brother
[46:29] we hear it all the time the message
[46:30] we've received is a restoration message
[46:32] if you restore something
[46:36] you're not making it something new
[46:40] you're taking what it was originally
[46:43] and you're working to restore it back to
[46:48] the same condition
[46:51] pretty simple
[46:52] restoration 101
[46:54] you're taking it back to the same
[46:57] condition
[46:58] you're not alternate you're not making
[47:00] it something that it wasn't you're
[47:02] restoring it back to how it looked in
[47:05] its first day
[47:07] so you say brother Matt then if the
[47:09] message is restoring us then what's it
[47:11] restoring us to let's let the prophet
[47:13] say that here the end time message he
[47:15] says according to Malachi 4 is to bring
[47:17] them back to the faith that was once
[47:20] delivered to the Saints bring them back
[47:23] to the faith of the fathers the
[47:26] Pentecostal part not 1906 Azusa Street

[47:32] part
[47:33] it's the first church part in the
[47:36] restoration time I will restore saith
[47:38] the Lord that's real end time evangelism
[47:41] for God said I will restore it he's
[47:44] going to restore it Hell by four death
[47:46] Messengers killed it then by then four
[47:49] life Messengers will restore it what was
[47:52] the first Martin Luther justification
[47:54] what was the second John Wesley by
[47:57] sanctification what was the third
[47:59] Pentecost with the restoration of the
[48:02] gifts the Holy Ghost baptism of the Holy
[48:04] Ghost what was the fourth the word what
[48:09] the word
[48:13] we need all of it
[48:15] what do we what have we been restored
[48:17] back to all of it brother Matt
[48:19] what part of it not not just a part of
[48:22] it
[48:23] all of it
[48:25] wait you mean the entire thing the whole
[48:27] book The the whole book the whole thing
[48:30] wasn't available to Martin it wasn't
[48:32] available to Colombia it wasn't
[48:34] available to John Wesley but it's
[48:36] available to you
[48:38] how do I get it go up and grab it take a
[48:40] hold of it the angel said to John John
[48:43] said give me the book and the angel said
[48:45] take it from my hand you know what
[48:47] happens when you take it then it becomes
[48:50] your book it's not mom's book it's not
[48:52] dad's book it's not the pastor's book
[48:54] it's not it's his promise or his
[48:56] inheritance it's mine
[48:59] it's my book it's my promise
[49:03] it's my inheritance
[49:06] he says by four death Messengers what
[49:08] happened sanctification say what part of
[49:10] it brother Matt everything that the
[49:12] first church had is your inheritance as
[49:16] a believer
[49:18] don't settle short of any of it
[49:22] say brother Matt then what is mine let
[49:24] me just tell you what the first church
[49:26] had the first church had the knowledge
[49:30] and the revelation of the word and they
[49:34] taught it and they preached it and they
[49:38] lived it
[49:39] did you hear me
[49:41] they had the word and they taught it
[49:45] so we don't do away with teaching
[49:48] and they preached it so we don't do away
[49:50] with preachers
[49:52] and they lived it
[49:55] this is what the first church had the
[49:58] first church had the demonstration when
[50:01] I'm preaching to you and I'm up here
[50:02] yelling and spitting that's not
[50:04] demonstrating the word
[50:07] I heard so somebody say that what a
[50:09] misunderstanding that is
[50:11] it is not demonstrating the word if I'm
[50:13] up here preaching that's good I I
[50:15] believe in Inspiration I believe in
[50:17] inspired preaching brother Adam says
[50:19] sometimes you you really clinch the nail
[50:24] but demonstration is when that word this
[50:28] word
[50:29] is living behind skin
[50:33] and you're demonstrating it with your
[50:35] life
[50:36] what did the first church have they had
[50:39] the demonstration of the Holy Ghost by
[50:42] the manifestation of gifts
[50:45] in the entire body not just the
[50:47] preachers it wasn't just Paul and Peter
[50:50] it wasn't just Silas it wasn't just it
[50:52] wasn't just Andrew this this wasn't this
[50:54] wasn't just a Ministry thing
[50:57] this wasn't just a preacher thing
[50:59] listen the message of the hour is not
[51:01] just to preach done just to preachers
[51:02] it's not just to little groups here and
[51:04] little groups there it's to the entire
[51:06] body it's to your children and your
[51:09] children's children as many of come on I
[51:12] should have an amen from that this
[51:13] morning
[51:14] it's to you it's you that should make
[51:16] you happy it's to me it's to me it's to
[51:19] you it's the letter it's written it's
[51:22] addressed to you
[51:25] it's your name your name's on the book
[51:28] when you recognize that the letter
[51:30] didn't just come to a prophet the
[51:31] prophet was just a mailman delivering a
[51:34] message from the throne
[51:36] it was not brother random's message it
[51:38] was the message from the throne why did
[51:41] the angel vindicate his ministry to show
[51:43] you that this is a message not from a
[51:46] Kentucky hillbilly
[51:48] it's from the very Throne of God the
[51:50] same voice that spoke to Moses the same
[51:52] voice that spoke to David the same voice
[51:54] that spoke to Joseph the same voice that
[51:56] spoke to Paul has now spoken again in
[51:59] this last day
[52:02] the first church had the demonstration
[52:04] of the Holy Ghost
[52:06] in gifts
[52:08] for the entire body not just the
[52:11] ministry
[52:12] the laity the people the non-ministerial
[52:16] gifts
[52:17] in the first church were not absorbers
[52:22] are sponges
[52:24] of everything Paul said they didn't just
[52:26] sit and go
[52:29] keep talking Paul I'm going to write it
[52:31] all down page two page three page four
[52:33] I'm gonna put that into a PDF document
[52:35] I'm going to print it now I'm going to
[52:36] make it into a book I'm going to put it
[52:37] on my shelf
[52:41] they weren't just absorbers of the word
[52:45] they took that word brother random says
[52:47] it this way he says he says that Paul
[52:49] saw it come in a subtle way of worship
[52:51] which excluded the people in any part in
[52:54] a holy ghost Ministry brother Brandon
[52:56] says but when he says but that's a far
[52:58] cry from what Paul preached he says when
[53:02] all come together all participate
[53:05] and spiritual worship can you say Amen
[53:08] they weren't absorbers what they heard
[53:10] and taught they were participators
[53:14] in spiritual worship
[53:17] the first church had listened to what
[53:19] they had the first church had the divine
[53:22] nature of Christ
[53:24] dwelling in them
[53:26] on a daily basis
[53:29] the divine nature of Jesus of Nazareth
[53:34] was now bodied and living in human
[53:38] beings
[53:40] they had the vert they had the divine
[53:42] nature you know what they were they were
[53:45] kindly affectionate one to another
[53:50] brother Matt come on get back to all
[53:53] that you know the power of the Holy
[53:55] Ghost and raising the dead and speaking
[53:58] in tongues and just casting out demon
[54:01] spirits
[54:04] you got to have all of it
[54:07] because we've been restored to all of it
[54:13] brother random says I'd rather have love
[54:17] in a body than any gift in the church
[54:22] and he says because with gifts there'll
[54:24] be misunderstanding with gifts they'll
[54:26] bring confusion but with perfect love
[54:28] perfect love will bring perfect gifts
[54:33] quote
[54:34] what did the first church have brother
[54:36] Matt
[54:38] the first church had the gifts of the
[54:40] Spirit in operation in their local
[54:41] churches
[54:43] they had Faith he said what is Faith
[54:45] it's a gift of the spirit
[54:47] I don't have any I don't speak in
[54:49] tongues what do you have faith
[54:52] this is a gift of the spirit
[54:54] wisdom
[54:55] the gift of wisdom this is First
[54:58] Corinthians to some the gift of faith
[55:00] the others the gift of wisdom the gift
[55:02] of knowledge
[55:04] the gift of speaking in tongues the gift
[55:07] of interpretation of tongues prophecy
[55:10] the gift of healing
[55:14] the gifts of healing this is part of the
[55:16] body this is First Corinthians this is
[55:18] your inheritance this is what was
[55:20] restored this is what's available
[55:23] this is what's to you this morning this
[55:25] is what you can have right now
[55:30] the gift of healing the working of
[55:33] Miracles I'm reading to you right from
[55:34] the Bible
[55:35] this is what the first church had the
[55:37] working of Miracles the gift of Prophecy
[55:40] the gift of the discernment of spirits
[55:44] this is what the first church had
[55:47] then what is our expectation for our
[55:51] churches
[55:54] it should be the same thing
[55:59] the only gift that operates should not
[56:01] be the gift that operates behind a
[56:03] Pulpit on Wednesdays at seven and
[56:05] Sundays at 11.
[56:07] that's a sad thing what a cold stale
[56:10] what a unhealthy Church what a breeding
[56:13] ground for unhealthy spiritual lives if
[56:16] the only gift is the sage on the stage
[56:19] or the man that's got the word he brings
[56:21] God in his briefcase and he packs it and
[56:24] then he carries it and everyone just
[56:25] sits and listens and absorbs
[56:27] what a what a what a far cry as brother
[56:30] random says when a Far Cry of what the
[56:32] Apostle Paul said when all come together
[56:34] all participate in spiritual
[56:38] I should get allowed
[56:41] amen
[56:44] they had
[56:45] he said brother Matt that's wonderful
[56:46] they had all the gifts you know what
[56:48] else they had they had the fruits of the
[56:49] spirit
[56:51] they had this fruit of love
[56:55] they had the fruit of joy
[56:58] that's a fruit
[56:59] that's for you
[57:01] and if you need it today just reach a
[57:03] hold of it and grab it and take a bite
[57:04] out of it because it's a fruit for you
[57:06] if you don't have joy this morning God
[57:08] can give it to you right now it's
[57:10] available to you right now can you say
[57:13] Amen
[57:14] the fruit of Peace the fruit of the
[57:17] long-suffering the fruit of gentleness
[57:19] that's a fruit of the spirit
[57:22] the fruit of gentleness the fruit of
[57:24] goodness the fruit of Faith the fruit of
[57:27] meekness the fruit of temperance which
[57:29] means control
[57:33] you say brother Matt what did the church
[57:34] have they had all the gifts of the
[57:36] Spirit operating they had all the
[57:38] manifestations of the fruits of the
[57:40] spirit in their lives they didn't miss
[57:42] let me say it this way if we made your
[57:45] own one and leave out any other we sell
[57:49] ourselves short of the full word that's
[57:52] been released to the bride in this
[57:55] generation
[57:57] some cut out emotion others cut out
[57:59] teaching some cut out dancing others cut
[58:02] out brotherly love some cut out tapes
[58:05] others cut out preachers
[58:09] do you see what's happening here
[58:13] let's cut out one and keep the other
[58:14] it's cut out one and keep the other some
[58:16] cut out love some cut out tapes others
[58:19] cut out preaching some cut out the
[58:21] message entirely
[58:23] others just cut out the Bible
[58:25] some cut out repentance
[58:27] others just cut out Grace entirely
[58:30] do you realize it's the tactic of the
[58:33] devil to push us into ditches
[58:37] it's always the tactic of the enemy to
[58:39] get us to Major on minors and minor own
[58:42] Majors to always push us to one side to
[58:45] make us one against the other
[58:47] but let me just say this I want all of
[58:50] it
[58:50] I want all of it I don't just want how
[58:53] many with me can say I don't just want a
[58:55] part of it I want all of it this morning
[58:57] I want everything God wanted to give us
[59:00] I want to say let me receive it Lord let
[59:03] me live so holy let me live so righteous
[59:06] but let me love my brother let me love
[59:08] love for my sister let me have care for
[59:10] one another let me be kindly
[59:12] affectionate one to another
[59:18] brother Brandon says what was their
[59:19] promise I'm going to close God said our
[59:21] restored is going to restore it how he
[59:23] says the word let me let me look at this
[59:24] this is another promise for this
[59:26] generation a Revival
[59:29] I you know let me just stop and say this
[59:33] I should be able to come up to this
[59:35] pulpit and just read these quotes
[59:37] and I should have the attention and the
[59:40] focus
[59:41] of everybody this should be
[59:44] you it's it's incredible to me sometimes
[59:46] a preacher could come with wonderful and
[59:48] man you you come with some of the big
[59:50] things some amazing that everyone's that
[59:53] wants a feel-good message they want to
[59:55] be encouraged that's all good that's all
[59:56] wonderful but this is what we should be
[59:58] attracted to right here
[1:00:00] let me say nothing and let me re read
[1:00:03] this and it will stir the bride of
[1:00:05] Christ
[1:00:06] if this doesn't move you nothing will
[1:00:10] is that all right this morning
[1:00:12] listen to me young people this is what
[1:00:14] you should be feeding on every day
[1:00:16] not Instagram and Tick Tock and Facebook
[1:00:18] and all those things they have maybe
[1:00:20] that there's a part of that but you
[1:00:22] should feel a part of your day and feel
[1:00:24] your real void this is what really fills
[1:00:26] the void this is what really fills the
[1:00:28] emptiness right here
[1:00:30] I think sometimes we get into such an
[1:00:32] anemic condition because we don't feed
[1:00:33] upon the message of the hour enough
[1:00:38] thank you Lord
[1:00:40] a Revival notice what brother random
[1:00:42] says his promise this is the presence of
[1:00:43] God unrecognized a Revival to my opinion
[1:00:46] doesn't consist of bringing new members
[1:00:48] a Revival doesn't consist of a bunch of
[1:00:50] convergence although those things go
[1:00:51] along with the Revival but a Revival is
[1:00:54] to revive what you already got
[1:00:57] it just to get them revived the bride
[1:01:01] hasn't had a Revival yet there has been
[1:01:03] no Revival no manifestation of God to
[1:01:05] stir the bride but we're looking for it
[1:01:07] there's the expectation it will take
[1:01:09] those seven unknown Thunders back there

[1:01:22] place let the word of God have
[1:01:24] preeminence how many can say that I want

[1:01:28] need a Revival wash all the unbelief out
[1:01:32] wash it Lord every single bit of it let
[1:01:35] a Revival so stir me I may not speak in

[1:02:01] building
[1:02:03] that's what Revival we need
[1:02:06] that's what a Revival's for I think that
[1:02:09] it's time that we should never let the
[1:02:13] spirit of Revival die
[1:02:16] parents you want to know what to strive
[1:02:18] for church you want to know what to
[1:02:19] fight for don't ever let the spirit of
[1:02:23] Revival die we've got to keep a keeping
[1:02:26] Revival constantly revive every day
[1:02:31] not just at the next Youth Camp not
[1:02:33] Bethel Youth Camp 2022 in 2023 or the
[1:02:37] octar the meetings that we have in this
[1:02:38] church that shouldn't be your only

[1:02:44] Lord today is a new day revive me again
[1:02:48] Lord Jesus
[1:02:50] we must never let that Revival die
[1:02:53] within us
[1:02:54] we've got to apply the token you say I
[1:02:56] love what brother random says there he
[1:02:58] says it's not something new
[1:03:00] it's not something new
[1:03:02] you know everyone's looking for
[1:03:03] something far off somewhere way off
[1:03:08] you say brother Matt where I'm at right
[1:03:10] now all of this is wonderful let me just
[1:03:13] preach to you can I have about five
[1:03:14] minutes
[1:03:16] say brother the man all this wonderful I
[1:03:18] believe it all but oh you just don't you
[1:03:20] don't see my you don't see my current
[1:03:22] condition
[1:03:24] you don't see where I'm currently at
[1:03:26] where I'm you got to be real with the
[1:03:28] people brother Matt right now you don't
[1:03:30] understand where I'm at right now in
[1:03:33] this moment in the month of September
[1:03:35] you don't see all of the all of the
[1:03:38] different layers that complicate my life
[1:03:41] and complicate my family and complicate
[1:03:44] my situation I I don't even I see all
[1:03:47] that and I believe all that and I look I
[1:03:49] I accept all that but but how do I get
[1:03:52] from where I'm at currently to where
[1:03:55] you're preaching way way over here how
[1:03:57] do I how do I get to that Revival
[1:03:59] brother Brandon says it's not it's not
[1:04:00] bringing something new
[1:04:02] it's stirring what you already have
[1:04:06] you know what you have to do you have to
[1:04:08] learn and I'm preaching to myself here
[1:04:10] today right with you you know what you
[1:04:12] have to do rather than being discouraged
[1:04:14] about your current condition I don't
[1:04:17] care if it's your health your money your
[1:04:19] job your your family your your marriage
[1:04:21] your home no matter what it is spiritual
[1:04:24] condition you're wherever you're at your
[1:04:26] prayer life
[1:04:27] where you estimate yourself to be in the
[1:04:29] in the in the in the scale of the
[1:04:31] spectrum of close to God or far away
[1:04:33] from God I don't care where you feel
[1:04:35] like I'm preaching this to every human
[1:04:37] being in this building
[1:04:40] I don't care where you think you fall or
[1:04:43] where you're at in that Spectrum let me
[1:04:46] tell you what we've got to start doing
[1:04:47] we've got to learn to start where you
[1:04:52] are now
[1:04:55] what you have to do is start
[1:04:58] don't look for what's down the road
[1:05:00] don't it's so insurmountable how am I
[1:05:02] ever going to get there I'm preaching to
[1:05:04] you and have the right expectation
[1:05:06] you've got to start where you're
[1:05:08] standing you've got to start where but
[1:05:11] where I'm standing is a mess brother
[1:05:13] Matt you haven't seen it start where
[1:05:16] you're standing
[1:05:18] no matter where you're at currently
[1:05:20] everyone's looking for something way off
[1:05:22] in the distance to happen I our
[1:05:24] expectation is oh well brother Matt when
[1:05:26] this happens and you know if this
[1:05:28] happens and this pans out you know then
[1:05:30] then things might work out
[1:05:32] I heard a statement I read it the other
[1:05:34] they're so powerful it said large doors
[1:05:37] swing on small hinges
[1:05:41] large doors you might need a big door
[1:05:44] open today
[1:05:46] but just a little small hinge of faith
[1:05:49] if you start with just a little bit of
[1:05:51] faith and commit that to God watch that
[1:05:54] large door swing open
[1:05:57] and don't take the Great and the
[1:05:59] Fantastic it just takes a little bit of
[1:06:01] common faith brother Brandon said just a
[1:06:03] little kiss of Just a Little Bit of
[1:06:05] Faith and you have to start where you're
[1:06:07] standing you say brother Matt what does
[1:06:09] that mean don't wait to start till
[1:06:11] things get better
[1:06:13] start right now
[1:06:16] so right now remember brother Caleb
[1:06:18] preached out at our Bible study about
[1:06:20] Nehemiah when Ezra when they came back
[1:06:22] to the to the temple it was in ruined
[1:06:24] and destruction
[1:06:26] it was destroyed and tattered and ruined
[1:06:28] you know what they did they got
[1:06:29] discouraged
[1:06:31] this is unbelievable we we wanted to
[1:06:34] come back we came back from Babylon we
[1:06:35] wanted to rebuild this Temple but my
[1:06:37] goodness it's it's covered over by weeds
[1:06:40] you ever seen a house that hasn't been
[1:06:41] inhabited for 30 years a property that
[1:06:44] hasn't
[1:06:45] you can almost unrecognize that the
[1:06:46] shingles are torn off and animals are
[1:06:49] growing are living in the house not
[1:06:50] growing animals are living in the house
[1:06:52] weeds are growing in the windows the the
[1:06:54] the the the the the grass is is you know
[1:06:57] over top of the over top of the uh of
[1:07:00] the cars everything's just dilapidated
[1:07:04] you know what happens all that energy on
[1:07:06] the way there to work and we're going to
[1:07:07] restore we're going to build this thing
[1:07:09] you see it you go whoa
[1:07:13] I don't know about this and this is
[1:07:14] exactly what happens when they come back
[1:07:16] to the temple and they say listen Ezra
[1:07:19] we were all for rebuilding the temple
[1:07:22] but I mean
[1:07:24] this is this is insurmountable
[1:07:27] and the Bible says they become so
[1:07:29] discouraged they worked for a little bit
[1:07:31] worked for work for a little while and
[1:07:34] then after some time because of
[1:07:35] persecution and that just became the
[1:07:37] task became insurmountable you work on
[1:07:39] something old and it's just finally like
[1:07:41] to a point you're like you know what
[1:07:43] I I don't think is it even worth it can
[1:07:46] we even turn it around
[1:07:47] but hagiah comes to them and haggai says
[1:07:50] don't despise the day of small things
[1:07:54] don't look at a little bit of work as
[1:07:56] nothing you say then what do we got to
[1:07:58] do haggy I just pick up your hammer
[1:08:00] that's all you got to do you just gotta
[1:08:02] start
[1:08:03] don't look at the insurmountable just
[1:08:06] start going to work
[1:08:08] start doing something pick up your
[1:08:10] shovels don't look at the task in front
[1:08:12] of you look at the vision of a perfect
[1:08:15] Temple look at the vision of a of what
[1:08:17] what you're going to don't look at your
[1:08:20] current situation
[1:08:22] keep where God's bringing you to always
[1:08:26] for you
[1:08:30] I'm going to start when I when things
[1:08:32] get different say brother Matt how do I
[1:08:33] get out of here how do I go forward it's
[1:08:36] impossible what's in what you don't
[1:08:38] understand it's well it's impossible
[1:08:39] what's in front of me Giants are in
[1:08:41] front of me mountains are in front of me
[1:08:42] it's impossible it's a race it's a
[1:08:45] raging River I don't even have I don't
[1:08:47] have any big tools I don't have anything
[1:08:49] use what you got in your hand
[1:08:52] use what God's already given you
[1:08:54] everyone's looking for something God if
[1:08:56] you just give me this God's already
[1:08:57] given you something to whip the Devil
[1:08:59] he's already given you something to
[1:09:00] destroy the works of the devil in your
[1:09:02] home and in your life and in your mind
[1:09:03] you've got to learn to use what you've
[1:09:06] already got don't look for something new

[1:09:11] you've got the better
[1:09:14] you've already got it little David use

[1:09:45] and limited resources

[1:09:49] shamgar didn't have much of nothing
[1:09:52] an ox goat
[1:09:53] his his resources were limited his
[1:09:56] options were very few
[1:09:59] odds the odds were stacked against him
[1:10:03] entirely
[1:10:05] 600 demon spirits
[1:10:08] would come to his family
[1:10:11] 600 demon Spirits I want you to look at
[1:10:13] them that way because you're you're

[1:10:44] his family you know what happened to
[1:10:46] shamgar one day I'm going to make it
[1:10:48] very simple we've preached on this a
[1:10:50] hundred times I'm going to make it very
[1:10:52] simple because I want it to be simple
[1:10:53] for you to realize what it took for
[1:10:56] shamgar to build enough Faith to pick up
[1:10:58] an ox go to slay all 600 demons you know
[1:11:02] what happened to shamgar one day he
[1:11:05] realized I'm on my farm
[1:11:09] this is my house
[1:11:12] this is my wife and that's my children
[1:11:17] this is my land and the devil's invading
[1:11:21] and taking everything he got because
[1:11:22] he's a thief and he's a robber he comes
[1:11:24] to steal kill and destroy and Sam Garr
[1:11:27] said I may not have much but I'm gonna
[1:11:29] start right where I'm standing I'm going
[1:11:32] to take what I already got and I'm gonna
[1:11:34] go to work on the devil in my life I'm
[1:11:37] not going to wait for the big and
[1:11:38] fantastic I'm not going to wait for
[1:11:39] Revival I'm going to say Lord stir up
[1:11:42] what you've already put inside of me
[1:11:46] you mean brother Matty didn't sit down
[1:11:48] and think of a game plan he didn't go
[1:11:50] four or five steps six steps to per you
[1:11:52] know to Restoration and this is how you
[1:11:54] heal your marriage and this is how you
[1:11:55] heal this and this is you go through all
[1:11:57] these 14 steps
[1:12:00] he didn't blueprint all this game plan
[1:12:01] didn't get with generals and of I know
[1:12:03] he didn't have any
[1:12:06] he didn't get there and prepare tanks
[1:12:07] okay when they come over here on the
[1:12:09] Left Flank we're gonna have an army over
[1:12:10] here and and you know I he didn't have
[1:12:13] any of that
[1:12:15] there was no plan
[1:12:17] there was no even thinking about it
[1:12:20] he heard the sound of the enemy coming
[1:12:22] and you know what he did he made a
[1:12:24] choice
[1:12:25] I'm gonna fight today
[1:12:29] and then he said I'm going to use what
[1:12:32] I've already got
[1:12:35] because God told me the miracle is not
[1:12:39] what's coming the miracle is what you
[1:12:42] already have in your hand

[1:13:04] consumed the other snakes what was it it
[1:13:06] wasn't looking for a missile or an AR-15
[1:13:08] or a rocket launcher he used what he
[1:13:11] already had in his hand and what he had
[1:13:13] in his hand was more than enough to
[1:13:15] defeat the Devil in his life

[1:18:52] example of the seed that falls on the
[1:18:54] Wayside and some falls on Estonian some
[1:18:57] falls on thorny and that ground that
[1:18:59] fall fell on Lord it was ground that was
[1:19:02] fallow ground it was hardened it was
[1:19:05] it received the seed but it couldn't
[1:19:07] take no root
[1:19:09] there was too much in the way
[1:19:13] the Bible says that birds came the fowls
[1:19:15] of the air and just came and
[1:19:17] plucked it up took what you planted
[1:19:20] I pray God that today you'd break the
[1:19:23] ground this morning
[1:19:25] may you break the Stony heart
[1:19:28] may you break that fallow ground up
[1:19:31] may you break past every barrier Lord
[1:19:34] that the devil puts upon our life every
[1:19:36] fear every complex
[1:19:39] let him look past Lord this morning the
[1:19:41] badger skin let them put look past the
[1:19:43] veil of Flesh wasn't brother Matt wasn't
[1:19:46] for the man who preached the sermon and
[1:19:48] said some things alike some things I
[1:19:50] didn't like some things I greeted some
[1:19:52] things I didn't agree with wasn't
[1:19:53] brother Matt Lord that's all people get
[1:19:56] from it this morning it'll do them no
[1:19:58] good
[1:19:59] but if we can recognize the voice of Our
[1:20:02] Shepherd
[1:20:05] we could recognize the voice of our
[1:20:07] friend
[1:20:09] who's like no other friend
[1:20:11] we could recognize that voice
[1:20:14] that calms all storms
[1:20:17] that answers all questions
[1:20:21] that removes all doubt
[1:20:23] that that voice that speaks and when you
[1:20:26] speak Lord
[1:20:29] when your voice
[1:20:30] contacts our heart
[1:20:33] Lord it breaks through all unbelief it
[1:20:35] breaks through every barrier
[1:20:38] it brings a peace that passes
[1:20:39] understanding I just raised my hand and
[1:20:42] say Lord let your voice
[1:20:44] let it whisper into the ear of your
[1:20:47] daughter this morning let it whisper
[1:20:49] into the ear of your son
[1:20:51] Lord let that voice that still Small
[1:20:53] Voice that spoke
[1:20:55] dealt with her heart
[1:20:57] that warned them that encouraged them
[1:20:59] that admonish them that rebuked them
[1:21:02] that rescued Lord a voice of redemption
[1:21:04] a voice of rescue whatever it was to
[1:21:07] them today I pray God that you'd break
[1:21:09] past every barrier
[1:21:12] there'd be someone here today Lord we
[1:21:15] still we read we heard about it today

[1:25:59] casting out all criticism I'm casting it
