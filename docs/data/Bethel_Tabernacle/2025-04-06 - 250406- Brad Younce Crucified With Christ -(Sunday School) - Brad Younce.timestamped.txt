[5:50] Good
[5:53] morning. Good morning. That's better.
[5:57] Let's all
[5:58] stand. Have a word of prayer before we
[6:00] get
[6:01] started. Father, we just thank you for
[6:03] this time we have to come together.
[6:05] Lord, I pray may you be with this this
[6:08] portion of the service this morning. May
[6:10] your spirit just come and anoint the
[6:12] lips, anoint the ears. Father, may you
[6:15] bless the bless this day, Lord, and
[6:17] bless our brothers preparing for the
[6:19] main service. Father, I pray Jesus name.
[6:22] Amen. I want to read in Luke chapter 9
[6:25] verse
[6:28] 23. And he said to them all, if any man
[6:32] will come after me, let him deny
[6:35] himself, take up his cross, and follow
[6:39] me. May God have a blessing you to have
[6:41] your seats. for a title I for this
[6:43] little portion I want to speak on it's
[6:45] like crucified with
[6:47] Christ or I should say what the cross
[6:50] actually means to us you know we're in a
[6:53] season where we'll hear a lot about
[6:56] about Calvary a lot about the cross it's
[6:59] Easter
[7:00] coming we'll hear all kinds and we don't
[7:02] want to downgrade what the cross means
[7:04] to us because the cross means a lot to
[7:06] us you know you you hear Jesus when if
[7:10] you read in in the scriptures Jesus,
[7:12] he'll talk more about his cross than he
[7:14] did his
[7:16] resurrection. And he tells us in here's
[7:18] Luke that, you know, deny yourself, take
[7:20] up your cross and follow me. So he's
[7:24] there's a lot in a statement crucified
[7:26] with Christ. It means so much to us as a
[7:28] believer. You know, it means it's
[7:30] atonement for our sin.
[7:33] It means the cross represents the
[7:34] atonement of sin where Jesus took on the
[7:37] punishment for us. Took all of our sins
[7:40] upon himself. It also gives us a new
[7:42] life. Through the cross and the
[7:45] resurrection, we're offered eternal life
[7:47] with him. It's your identity and your
[7:50] belonging. So what's your identify? The
[7:53] cross signifies belonging to Christ. So
[7:55] we are identified with his sacrifice
[7:57] because we were in him when he died.
[8:00] I'll go ahead and say we were also in
[8:01] him when he resurrected. It's our hope
[8:04] and assurance. The cross is our source
[8:06] of hope, assurance of God's love and his
[8:10] promise of
[8:11] salvation. It's a call to follow him.
[8:15] We're his disciples. Because the cross
[8:17] serves as a reminder of of of a call to
[8:20] follow Jesus, which was in this
[8:22] scripture. It involves our sacrifice and
[8:24] taking up one's own cross. It's also a
[8:26] victory over sin and death.
[8:29] So the cross
[8:31] signifies God's
[8:33] love. Remember when God's love when he
[8:36] was in the beginning in the garden of
[8:37] Eden when Adam and Eve did what they did
[8:39] and fell and God put the lamb skins on
[8:41] them and they were leaving the garden.
[8:43] You know the prophet tells a very
[8:46] touching story of that that skin the
[8:48] skins were slapping their leg that some
[8:51] god had so much love he says I won't
[8:54] leave you that way I will make a way for
[8:56] you. So when he comes down for the cross
[8:58] signifies his love and his sacrifice and
[9:01] what a sacrifice that God did that God
[9:03] came down into a into a virgin woman and
[9:07] made himself a body and then what kind
[9:10] of sacrifice did he do for us you know
[9:12] we hear we'll hear the story of the
[9:13] garden of Gethsemane what he happened
[9:15] what happened there in the garden where
[9:18] Jesus was even praying and great drops
[9:19] of blood would the sweat would be like
[9:22] like drops of blood he was such agony
[9:24] and he was doing that just for us. And
[9:26] then when he went into Calvary or went
[9:29] to Pilate's hall and they beat him with
[9:30] the whips and the chunks of flesh was
[9:32] coming off his back was just for us. The
[9:36] importance of Calvary. That's being
[9:38] crucified with Christ. And he then he
[9:40] put those crown of thorns upon his head
[9:42] and that blood just dripping down. And
[9:44] what agony that he just did just for
[9:46] you,
[9:47] Enoch. He just did it for each one of
[9:49] us. What a sacrifice that he did because
[9:51] he knew what Calvary was going to do for
[9:53] us. because Calvary can do a lot. You
[9:56] know, how many believers do we have here
[9:58] this
[10:00] morning? Praise God. Or we're all
[10:02] believers. So, we're not down wanting to
[10:04] downgrade the importance of the cross
[10:06] because it's very important because the
[10:08] cross made everything possible for us.
[10:12] It brought redemption. It brought
[10:14] healing. It brought us
[10:17] power. Thank God. We need power in this
[10:20] day. All the things that the cross did
[10:22] made everything
[10:25] possible. So Jesus went to the cross one
[10:29] time. Now he didn't have to go every day
[10:32] for us. One time was enough for him to
[10:35] go to Calvary, but he was telling us
[10:37] that we need to go every
[10:39] day. That we need to because he says,
[10:42] "Take up your cross and follow me daily.
[10:46] Not just once a week. on Sunday when we
[10:48] come to
[10:49] church we'll crucify ourel but he said
[10:52] you need to die to yourself daily so
[10:54] what happened with Jesus he would take
[10:55] up what to take up that cross means he
[10:57] picked up that cross drug it down the
[11:00] streets
[11:00] of headed up toward Calvary for his
[11:03] death so that's what what we need to do
[11:06] we need to bring our cross and we need
[11:07] to come in here and we need to kill
[11:09] ourselves we need to take ourselves up
[11:12] to nail ourselves to the cross
[11:15] daily I need to take myself daily and
[11:17] nail my hands to the cross and kill this
[11:20] flesh. We should but you know we should
[11:23] glory in the
[11:24] crucifixion in such gory and you know
[11:27] such agony that we seem but we should
[11:29] glory in in the crucifixion because Paul
[11:31] says in Galatians 6:14 but God forbid
[11:35] that I should
[11:36] glory that God forbid that I should
[11:39] glory and what if you read the
[11:40] scriptures before this these men were
[11:44] telling the the people that they need to
[11:46] get
[11:47] circumcised and then then when they did
[11:49] they were taken to glory for It said
[11:51] they got it because I said so. And it's
[11:53] not it's like you hear I hear a lot of
[11:55] preachers talking which is a shame. I
[11:58] had this great meeting. I went to this
[12:00] meeting. So many people come to the
[12:02] altar when I was preaching the word and
[12:05] bragging on it. You know it's just a
[12:07] different you hear some people say you
[12:08] know I was preaching and God brought all
[12:10] these they gave glory to God but these
[12:12] men were bringing glory to themselves.
[12:14] Paul says, "God forbid that I should
[12:16] even
[12:17] glory in this, save in the cross of our
[12:22] Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world was
[12:23] crucified unto me, and I unto the
[12:26] world." I like the NLT version of this
[12:29] of this scripture. It says, "Has for me,
[12:32] may I never boast about
[12:36] anything except the cross of our Lord
[12:38] Jesus Christ." because of that
[12:42] cross. He says, "My interest in the
[12:45] world has been
[12:48] crucified." Thank God. How many
[12:50] interests of this world? I have no
[12:51] interest in this world. It's dead to me.
[12:54] When you've been crucified with Christ,
[12:56] this world is dead to you. You know,
[13:00] when you when you when you got saved and
[13:02] used to be out in the world and your
[13:04] friends and you party and used to be the
[13:06] party animal, your friends, what
[13:08] happened to you? used used to be
[13:11] fun. You you you you hosted some awesome
[13:14] parties. We loved you. The world loved
[13:17] us cuz we were they love cuz we were we
[13:19] were fun to be
[13:20] around. We used to drink. What happened
[13:24] to
[13:24] you? A new man has been formed. The old
[13:28] man has been dead. The new man has come
[13:30] to life.
[13:32] You say, "Yeah, I used to do all those
[13:34] things, but not anymore because I have
[13:37] been crucified with Christ." What does
[13:40] crucified mean? It means to
[13:43] mortify. It's
[13:45] death. So when you must die to the
[13:48] world, be ye not conformed to this
[13:49] world, but transformed by the renewing
[13:51] of your mind. Because Romans 8:13 says,
[13:52] "For if you live after the flesh, you
[13:55] shall
[13:56] die. But if you live through the spirit,
[14:00] you do mortify, which is kill the flesh,
[14:02] the deeds of this body, and you're going
[14:04] to live. So I die daily. So
[14:08] mortification means to means death. So
[14:11] I'm going to kill myself so I can
[14:15] live. Lord, what do you do when someone
[14:19] dies? We have a
[14:21] funeral. They'll they'll they'll bring
[14:23] them right up here and set the casket in
[14:25] front of the front of the altar here.
[14:27] and you come by and you give your
[14:28] respects. You look down in here and you
[14:30] might shed a few tears and tell the
[14:31] family, "I'm so sorry. My condolences.
[14:34] Sorry for your loss. You, that man's
[14:36] buried. He's dead." So, what do we do?
[14:39] How many brought your casket here this
[14:42] morning? I brought
[14:44] mine. And I already got my headstone
[14:46] already prepared. Here lies Brad Y. He
[14:49] died today. Of course, Brad Jon says
[14:52] he's died several times this week
[14:55] because what Paul says, I die daily. So,
[14:58] we're crucifi we're being crucified. So,
[15:00] we're dying
[15:02] daily. Paul says, I protest by re your
[15:05] rejoicing which I have in Christ, Jesus
[15:07] our Lord. I die daily. He was expressing
[15:11] the idea of putting aside his own
[15:13] desires and his own ambitions to follow
[15:16] Christ more closely.
[15:20] It reflects a daily commitment to
[15:22] self-denial and spiritual growth,
[15:25] acknowledging the need to overcome
[15:27] challenges and remain faithful. So when
[15:30] Paul is saying, I am crucified with
[15:32] Christ, but yet I
[15:33] live, that's what Galatians 2:20 says, I
[15:36] am crucified with Christ. Nevertheless,
[15:39] I live, yet not I. So it's not I or
[15:43] anything that I could have ever done,
[15:46] but it was Christ that liveth in me. And
[15:49] the life which I now live in the flesh,
[15:51] this new life that I live, even though
[15:54] I'm still in this flesh, he's saying, I
[15:57] live by the faith of the son of God who
[15:59] loved me and gave himself for
[16:02] me. The NLT verse says, "My old self has
[16:05] been crucified with Christ. It's no
[16:07] longer I who live, but Christ lives in
[16:10] me. So I live in his earthly body by
[16:13] trusting in the son of god who loved me
[16:16] and gave himself for me. Listen to what
[16:19] brother said about this. He said now if
[16:22] we don't if we want to see
[16:24] him he says if you ever expect to see
[16:28] how many wants to see him I'm going to
[16:30] tell you what you have to do. If you
[16:33] ever expect to see him, you'll never see
[16:36] him by joining a
[16:38] church, signing your name to some book,
[16:42] some creed you serve. You'll see him
[16:45] when you
[16:47] die. I'm not talking about the end of
[16:50] our road death. It's coming. But he says
[16:53] when you come to Calvary and are
[16:56] crucified to yourself, then you'll see
[17:00] Jesus.
[17:02] Thank the Lord. You'll find Jesus at the
[17:05] cross when you're crucified with him.
[17:09] You cannot find him until you die to
[17:11] yourself and accept him, the word. Then
[17:15] you find life. He says, "A real true
[17:19] disciple will bring you right straight
[17:22] into the presence of Christ. And from
[17:24] there, Christ will show you what you had
[17:27] to
[17:28] do." Ain't you thankful for real men of
[17:30] God?
[17:32] They won't lead. They're not leading you
[17:34] to themselves. Brother Jason, don't
[17:36] stand up here and point to himself.
[17:38] That's why he has the assistant pastor
[17:40] on his door back here. He's leading you
[17:43] to somebody, not himself. Brother Matt's
[17:45] not leading you to himself. Brother JD,
[17:48] who's going to be speaking a little bit.
[17:49] He's not leading you to himself. He's
[17:51] got all we all got one thing in mind.
[17:53] That's to lead you to Jesus Christ.
[17:54] We're not pointing to some church. We're
[17:57] pointing you to Christ. But it says,
[17:59] "And when you get a real disciple that
[18:01] appoints you to Christ, Christ will
[18:03] bring you to the cross where you are
[18:05] crucified with
[18:07] him." Romans 6:6 says, "Knowing this,
[18:10] that our old man, our old sinful selves
[18:13] is crucified with him, that the body of
[18:17] sin might be destroyed, that henceforth
[18:19] we should we should serve, we should not
[18:22] serve sin. For he that is dead is freed
[18:25] from sin." So when we died with Christ,
[18:28] we were set free by the power of
[18:31] sin. So what happens when you're dead
[18:33] with Christ? I love this statement right
[18:36] here. His eternal life and your life
[18:41] meets together and your life dies and
[18:45] you take on his eternal life, then
[18:49] you're a son of God. Hallelujah. Jesus
[18:52] was Jesus pointed to his death saying I
[18:56] must die so you can
[18:59] live. But Jesus he he says in Matthew
[19:02] 16:25 verse 24 then said Jesus unto his
[19:06] disciples if any man will come after me
[19:09] let him deny himself take up his cross
[19:12] and follow me.
[19:14] He says, "I'll point you to a place
[19:17] where I'm going to be I'm going to be
[19:19] crucified for you. And in
[19:24] there, if you'll be crucified with me
[19:26] and take up your cross and follow me,
[19:29] you'll know who I am." So, we don't even
[19:32] know who Christ is until we're actually
[19:34] die to ourselves, till we're actually
[19:36] crucified. Until we go in there. What a
[19:40] statement. We're going to go in there
[19:41] with him.
[19:44] how different it is. He said, "But your
[19:47] life, your life and his life found each
[19:50] other." Thank the Lord. Not at not at
[19:54] the church, not in a building, not in
[19:57] some
[19:58] creed, not in your good works. We have a
[20:01] lot of good works, but you're not going
[20:03] to find Christ in our good
[20:05] works. The only way you're going to find
[20:07] Christ is at the cross, where you are
[20:10] crucified with him. That's where you
[20:12] find him. You won't find him by doing
[20:16] better. We won't find him by turn over a
[20:19] new leaf. Every New Year's
[20:22] Day, I'm going to be different. I'm turn
[20:25] over a new leaf this year. I'm going to
[20:26] be totally different what I was last
[20:28] year in January the 2nd. You're back the
[20:30] same way you were in December
[20:32] 31st.
[20:34] Amen. Everybody says again, a true
[20:36] servant takes you to him and he is the
[20:40] word. And you'll say, 'Well, brother
[20:42] Brandham, if Christ is on earth today, a
[20:44] real servant would take him would take
[20:46] him to him, Christ. Well, Christ is here
[20:50] in the form of his word, and the word
[20:52] brings life because he is the
[20:55] word. Because it's the spirit that
[20:58] quickth John 6:63 says, the spirit that
[21:01] quickth the flesh profitth nothing. The
[21:02] words that I speak unto you, they are
[21:04] spirit and they are life. So, the spirit
[21:06] alone gives eternal life. Human effort
[21:10] accomplishes
[21:12] nothing. And the very works I have
[21:14] spoken to you are spirit and life. So
[21:17] Christ is the
[21:19] word. He is the word himself. The true
[21:22] servant always takes you to the
[21:25] word. He is the word. He is he is this
[21:29] Bible made living. And when you die to
[21:32] yourself with Christ, it's like a corn
[21:35] of wheat, you know. Then the word lives
[21:37] in you and it brings forth the same
[21:39] results as it did that in that living
[21:44] corn of wheat that had to drop into the
[21:47] earth signifying Jesus dying going to
[21:49] earth and rising back up. This is what
[21:52] dying
[21:53] does. It makes you partakers of his
[21:57] resurrection. You're partakers with him.
[22:01] So when we die, this is what happens.
[22:02] We're partakers with him. some of his
[22:04] blessings on what he feels like given at
[22:06] the moment. All his blessings. He's not
[22:10] just going to give what he feels like.
[22:12] Well, I think you just deserve this. I'm
[22:14] not going to give you nothing else. He
[22:15] gives you all the
[22:18] blessings in all of the manifestations.
[22:22] You're partakers with him in all that he
[22:24] did. It's all because of
[22:27] Calvary. All because of Calvary. Now, if
[22:29] you're a son and daughter of God, then
[22:31] you were in God at the beginning. You're
[22:33] his attribute. If you weren't, if you
[22:36] weren't there then, you never were never
[22:40] will
[22:41] be. Sons and daughters of God that were
[22:43] in God in the beginning. Now look, you
[22:44] got eternal life. We believe it that we
[22:48] got eternal life. How many believes you
[22:50] got eternal life? So if you don't, don't
[22:52] leave here without it. There is only one
[22:55] form of eternal life and that's
[22:58] God. That's the only thing that is
[23:01] eternal. is God. Then if you got eternal
[23:04] life, that life that's in you always was
[23:09] and you were in the loins of God before
[23:11] there even was a
[23:13] world. Jesus himself was the
[23:17] word. And in St. John 1, it says, "In
[23:19] the beginning was the word and word was
[23:20] with God." We know the scriptures. So
[23:22] then you were in the loins of Jesus and
[23:25] you went to Calvary with him. You died
[23:29] with him. You raised with him. And so
[23:32] today you're sitting in heavenly places
[23:34] with
[23:35] him. That's what Ephesians 2 says. And
[23:37] raised us together and made us to sit
[23:40] together in heavenly places in Christ
[23:42] Jesus. For he raised us up from the dead
[23:45] along with Christ and seated us with him
[23:48] in the heavenly in the heavenly places
[23:51] because we are united with
[23:55] him. that in the ages to come. Verse se
[23:58] verse seven, that he might show the
[23:59] exceeding riches of his grace and his
[24:01] kindness toward us through Christ. So
[24:04] God can point us to all future ages as
[24:07] example of his wealth of his grace and
[24:09] kindness toward us has shown in all he
[24:11] has done for us who are united with
[24:14] Christ
[24:15] Jesus. Today we're sitting in heavenly
[24:18] places in him filled with his spirit,
[24:22] sons and daughters of God. We die with
[24:26] him. We raise with him. Sure, we was in
[24:29] his own we was in God's own thinking.
[24:31] God the great spirit in the beginning
[24:33] before there was was a beginning. He was
[24:35] God. Did you know that you were in him
[24:36] then? If you are a Christian now, you
[24:39] were in him
[24:42] then. It's the whole Godhead shaped in
[24:45] you. All because of Calvary. All because
[24:49] of you being crucified with him. So when
[24:51] Jesus died at the
[24:53] cross, I died with
[24:56] him. For as as I was in him then, for he
[25:00] was the fullness of the word made
[25:02] manifest, knowing that he we would
[25:03] manifest that we would manifest
[25:06] later, and we were at Calvary with him.
[25:09] We went to the grave with him, and we
[25:11] were raised with him in his
[25:12] resurrection. Romans 6:3 says, "Know you
[25:15] not that as many of us were baptized
[25:16] into Jesus Christ were baptized into his
[25:18] death?"
[25:20] He said, ' Or have you even forgotten
[25:21] that we were joined with Christ Jesus in
[25:24] baptism? We were joined with him at at
[25:27] his death. Therefore, we are buried with
[25:29] him by his baptism into death like as
[25:33] Christ was raised up from the dead by
[25:35] the glory of of the father. Even so, we
[25:39] also should walk in the newness of
[25:43] life. Re says, "Now we've
[25:46] ascended. We've ascended by his spirit
[25:50] to the throne of grace. We are today
[25:53] sitting in heavenly
[25:54] places in Christ Jesus always. You mean
[25:59] to tell me even though all hell is
[26:00] breaking loose, everything is going
[26:03] wrong, nothing goes right, we are still
[26:05] sitting in heavenly
[26:08] places. Man, it's powerful. He says,
[26:12] "For as a germ of natural life is
[26:14] brought down, germmitized from father to
[26:17] father to
[26:19] father." So who whatever you are was
[26:22] passed down from your great-grandfather
[26:23] to your grandfather to your dad to you
[26:26] and you'll pass on down to your
[26:28] son. So is the life of Christ
[26:32] germatized. The real
[26:35] you. This germ started in the Garden of
[26:37] Eden.
[26:39] It started there when Jesus made a
[26:41] sacrifice. When he took the lambs, he
[26:43] killed the He killed the lamb and put
[26:44] the the skins on them. He started
[26:47] something. He went on down through the
[26:49] to the bulls and
[26:50] goats. That germ seed bringing it on
[26:53] down from generation to generation till
[26:55] it come to Christ. And that germ seed
[26:57] went inside Christ when he died at
[26:59] Calvary. He sent that same germ seed of
[27:02] life to you on the day of Pentecost. So
[27:05] we actually have that today. So this
[27:08] germ was passed down from generation to
[27:10] generation is for you and your children
[27:13] or as many as our Lord our God shall
[27:15] call. That's the
[27:17] reason that God used Elijah's spirit
[27:20] five different
[27:21] times. It's a handing down of that same
[27:24] germ life. The handing down in where in
[27:27] Jesus God made me pay for my sins in him
[27:33] there and then he rose
[27:36] me with
[27:38] him in the resurrection. Now we are
[27:41] seated with him with power and authority
[27:44] over every
[27:45] devil. That's what crucified Christ
[27:48] means to me. I have victory over
[27:51] everything. Over every devil. Not just
[27:54] one, every
[27:59] devil. He says if you could believe what
[28:02] God has
[28:03] given and you're not seated there and
[28:06] you don't have it. And if you're se if
[28:08] you're not if you're seated there and
[28:09] don't believe it and afraid to move,
[28:10] you'll never use it. But if you are
[28:13] seated there, you will use it. For you
[28:14] are ordained to do what you do. Just
[28:17] remember when you were in your father's
[28:18] loins, you were with
[28:21] him. Let me skip something here real
[28:25] quick. Luke 9:23, I'm about finished. He
[28:28] said to them, or I'm about out of time,
[28:31] not finished. He said to them, "If any
[28:33] man will come after me, let him deny
[28:37] himself," which is means to
[28:41] disown, to have no acquaintance with. So
[28:45] you're supposed to have no acquaintance
[28:46] with
[28:47] yourself
[28:49] daily. Forget who you are.
[28:52] Jesus calls for every believer to live a
[28:55] daily life of
[28:57] commitment, sacrifice, self-denial. It
[29:00] don't
[29:01] mean that you're going to be
[29:04] beaten. But Josh, I ain't going to take
[29:06] a a whip and beat you this morning. It
[29:09] don't mean that, but it's something you
[29:11] have to do. You have to to to die daily.
[29:14] Self sacrifice. When you think about
[29:17] what God did for you, all that
[29:19] punishment, I said at the beginning, all
[29:21] that punishment that he went for for
[29:24] you, and sometimes we we can't hardly
[29:27] get out of bed on Sunday morning. Oh
[29:29] gosh, I got to go to
[29:31] church. Wednesday's even tough, too.
[29:34] I've worked all
[29:36] day.
[29:38] Sacrifice. We can go even further into
[29:40] that. We won't we won't do that. Every
[29:43] day should be a good Friday.
[29:47] I am crucified with
[29:49] Christ, but yet I
[29:52] live. Hallelujah. I'm going to stop
[29:54] right there. It's about time. God bless
[29:57] you.
