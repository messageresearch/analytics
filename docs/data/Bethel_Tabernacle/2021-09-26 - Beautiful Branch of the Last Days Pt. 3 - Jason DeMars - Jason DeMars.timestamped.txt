[33:02] joy comes from
[33:04] lord not our circumstances not what
[33:05] we're going through not
[33:07] the troubles that we face the trials
[33:09] that we're going through but
[33:11] it comes from knowing
[33:13] you
[33:14] and knowing what you said about us lord
[33:18] may we value you and your word above all
[33:20] else
[33:21] lord we ask for your holy spirit to come
[33:24] and to speak lord i need you there's
[33:25] there's
[33:26] some points here that i feel
[33:29] inadequate
[33:31] and hardly know how to express exactly i
[33:33] ask that your holy spirit would come
[33:35] and express what you're trying to
[33:37] express to your people
[33:39] that you would be glorified that your
[33:41] word
[33:42] would be magnified to our hearts lord
[33:44] and that we would be
[33:46] walking
[33:47] in unity with your heart father
[33:49] we ask these things in jesus christ's
[33:51] name amen
[33:53] god bless you all you can
[33:55] stay standing for a few moments i'm
[33:57] going to continue on my
[33:59] topic
[34:00] it says part two i forgot to update that
[34:02] it's part three beautiful branch
[34:05] of the last days
[34:07] and we're going to read the scripture
[34:08] isaiah 4
[34:10] 1-2
[34:13] and in that day
[34:14] seven women
[34:16] shall take hold of one one man saying we
[34:19] will eat our own bread
[34:21] and wear our own apparel only let us be
[34:24] called by thy name to take away our
[34:26] reproach
[34:28] in that day shall the branch of the lord
[34:30] be beautiful
[34:31] and glorious and the fruit of the earth
[34:33] shall be excellent and comely for them
[34:35] that are escaped of israel may the lord
[34:37] have the blessing to the reading of his
[34:39] word you can be seated
[34:43] so there's such a contrast
[34:46] in this verse and there's such a
[34:48] contrast
[34:49] in the day that we're living
[34:51] between
[34:53] the true godly woman who god
[34:56] describes as beautiful
[34:59] and the woman that the world describes
[35:02] as
[35:03] beautiful and i think this this these
[35:05] verses
[35:06] speak of that
[35:08] seven women
[35:09] taking hold that picture of taking hold
[35:12] of a man
[35:13] uh saying
[35:15] we'll do what we want to do
[35:17] we'll live how we want to live we don't
[35:18] have to submit to you we have to listen
[35:21] to you only let us be called by your
[35:23] name to take away our
[35:25] reproach i think
[35:27] we're living in the hour of what is
[35:29] called so-called feminism
[35:33] and the rise of feminism over the last
[35:35] 150 years
[35:37] and where
[35:38] it seems to me we're at it's pinnacle
[35:41] now
[35:43] in this spirit of feminism the really
[35:46] the reality is
[35:47] it's not about women's rights
[35:50] it's not about women being equal
[35:53] we've
[35:54] if you're a bible believer
[35:56] you've known for 2000 years
[35:58] that a woman is equal in value to a man
[36:02] jesus came and demonstrated that
[36:05] paul
[36:06] spoke of that reaffirmed that clearly
[36:10] and so this is not news to a christian
[36:13] they wanna the feminist movement wants
[36:15] you to think
[36:16] they're attacking christian
[36:19] values
[36:20] they've made up some strange a false
[36:24] dichotomy and spoken about history
[36:27] as though it's one tale after the other
[36:29] of christians
[36:31] misusing and abusing women and that's
[36:33] not true
[36:36] that's not a fact that's not what
[36:38] happened but it's been presented that
[36:40] way and it's a great disservice
[36:43] to the world and especially
[36:45] to women
[36:48] the the rights
[36:50] we talked about this before and i don't
[36:51] want to re
[36:52] go over the whole thing all over again
[36:55] but the rights of
[36:58] women are not the concern of feminism
[37:01] the concern of feminism
[37:03] is tearing down now that's what every
[37:05] feminist would tell you they are the
[37:06] rights of women and equality
[37:08] that's not what it's about
[37:11] it's about tearing down
[37:13] biblical standards
[37:16] in in many levels let's look at our next
[37:18] scripture this is one of them um
[37:23] keeps bouncing back
[37:25] the woman
[37:26] deuteronomy 22
[37:28] 5 the woman shall not wear that which
[37:30] pertains unto a man
[37:32] neither shall a man put on a woman's
[37:33] garment
[37:34] for all that do so are abomination unto
[37:37] the lord thy god we've taken this verse
[37:39] and we've seen only
[37:41] the garment portion but you have to re
[37:43] realize there's a spirit
[37:45] behind that
[37:47] brother branham talks about that he gave
[37:49] a woman a feminine or as he said a
[37:51] feminist
[37:52] spirit and he gave a man
[37:55] a masculine spirit
[37:58] so
[37:58] he made us to be different
[38:00] made us to have different roles
[38:02] different functions different purposes
[38:05] he made men with certain strengths and
[38:07] he made women with certain weaknesses
[38:09] and he men made men with certain
[38:10] weaknesses and women with certain
[38:12] strengths
[38:13] we're in equal
[38:15] in certain areas our value is equal
[38:19] that's what the scripture declares us
[38:21] our value
[38:22] in the sight of god
[38:24] and should be in the sight of all
[38:25] believers
[38:27] is equal
[38:29] but but as far as our attributes
[38:32] they're inequal
[38:34] they're not the same
[38:35] they're different
[38:36] that's scientifically proven and
[38:38] scripturally backed up completely
[38:41] and we'll talk about that more
[38:44] god wants a man to dress and act
[38:47] like a man
[38:49] he wants a woman to dress
[38:52] and act like a woman
[38:55] it's not just
[38:56] dressing you can dress like a woman and
[39:00] act like a man
[39:02] it's the whole picture that god
[39:05] wants to see
[39:07] the attributes god wants to see
[39:10] true womanhood is a beautiful reflection
[39:13] of
[39:14] the bride of christ
[39:17] true manhood
[39:18] is a beautiful reflection
[39:21] of jesus christ
[39:24] these things need to be balanced
[39:27] okay that's that's many of our problems
[39:30] is
[39:31] this is spoken a person in the world
[39:34] hears one thing
[39:36] right a person who is perhaps a man
[39:39] who's a chauvinist
[39:40] is like go get them jason
[39:44] i'm not going and getting them
[39:49] there's balance
[39:52] god does not want does not want a woman
[39:54] to be domineering
[39:57] or bossy
[39:59] right
[40:02] he does not want a woman also to be
[40:03] fearful
[40:05] and weak willed
[40:07] so timid
[40:09] you know the picture of a
[40:10] a southern belle is so timid that they
[40:12] couldn't even let the sun shine on their
[40:14] skin
[40:15] be so afraid of it
[40:17] god doesn't want a woman to be afraid he
[40:18] doesn't want her to be bossy balance
[40:21] he wants a woman to be balanced as a
[40:24] feminine spirit
[40:27] he also doesn't want a man
[40:29] to be power hungry
[40:31] verb verbally abusive
[40:34] drunk with his own
[40:37] authority because of his physical
[40:38] strength
[40:39] doesn't want a man to be that way he
[40:41] also doesn't want a man to be
[40:43] disconnected checked out
[40:46] uninvolved or the other reverse of that
[40:49] is to become effeminate
[40:52] and then sees authority by being
[40:55] effeminate because it's okay to be a
[40:57] bossy woman in culture today so if
[40:59] you're a bossy effeminate man no problem
[41:04] but if you're a man that takes authority
[41:06] respects people loves people wants to
[41:09] achieve the best for every person
[41:11] that's not something that people
[41:14] in this world want or appreciate
[41:16] a woman that says i enjoy submitting to
[41:21] my loving husband is not something the
[41:23] world wants
[41:26] it views it as weak it isn't weak
[41:29] it takes a lot of strength
[41:32] takes a lot of strength for a woman to
[41:34] say i will
[41:36] submit to what my husband
[41:38] wants my husband wants this i have i
[41:41] will submit to the vision now it doesn't
[41:43] mean you don't talk to each other
[41:45] doesn't mean there isn't a back and
[41:47] forth connection that takes place i'm
[41:50] talking about a vision
[41:52] that god gives to a husband
[41:55] to lead in a certain direction in the
[41:58] life
[41:59] right that's what we're talking about
[42:01] headship
[42:02] headship is christ
[42:04] leading a family
[42:06] through the husband
[42:08] and the husband and wife together
[42:10] communicating about what's happening
[42:12] leadership isn't just
[42:14] doing what you want to do
[42:16] and let everybody else figure it out
[42:18] leadership is communicating a vision
[42:22] of what god is leading you to do
[42:26] and then
[42:27] the will
[42:28] of the family because the holy spirit is
[42:31] leading you and not you leading you
[42:34] of course a woman wouldn't have to
[42:35] listen to a man that's telling her to do
[42:37] something that's unscriptural
[42:39] she wouldn't have to submit to that
[42:41] whereas a woman is to submit as unto the
[42:43] lord
[42:44] so if the devil is saying something you
[42:47] don't have to listen to the devil
[42:48] you don't have to submit to the devil
[42:50] but if god is leading by the spirit
[42:54] that's where a woman is submitting
[42:57] to because she if she has the holy
[42:59] spirit she can see the holy spirit is
[43:01] leading us both
[43:03] in this direction i believe god leads
[43:05] both a man and a woman a husband and a
[43:07] wife
[43:08] it isn't just god leads the man and the
[43:10] woman just lays there as a dead carcass
[43:12] and he drags her along
[43:16] she has
[43:19] a heart that god is dealing with
[43:21] and working with
[43:24] and changing and transforming
[43:27] there's a balance in all of it
[43:29] if a husband says i would like to see us
[43:32] more in line with the word of god
[43:35] in this or this or this
[43:38] a true godly wife will take it as a
[43:40] correction
[43:41] and say thank you
[43:43] you're protecting me
[43:45] not say i have my own i have my own walk
[43:48] with the lord i don't have to listen to
[43:49] you
[43:51] that's not scripture
[43:54] that's not right
[43:56] together
[43:58] husband it's not you beating your wife
[44:00] across the head i have a i have a dear
[44:03] friend
[44:04] he's come to the message
[44:06] i'm saying verbally beating across that
[44:09] obviously not with your hand
[44:11] you're not even a man
[44:13] if you do that
[44:15] but i have a dear friend he's come to
[44:17] the message
[44:18] recently his whole family is not yet
[44:21] embraced the message so
[44:24] what should i do then should i verbally
[44:26] abuse my wife until she follows the
[44:27] message no
[44:29] should i force her to do that brother
[44:31] branham says you have a right to divorce
[44:33] her if she cuts her hair it's a right
[44:35] okay but we surrender
[44:38] all of our rights
[44:39] to the leadership of the holy spirit
[44:42] okay
[44:43] and so
[44:44] the brother
[44:45] i feel like
[44:47] is a great example because he's not
[44:49] manipulative he's not controlling even
[44:52] if his wife says things that he doesn't
[44:54] like
[44:55] about the message
[44:56] he doesn't fly off the handle he remains
[44:59] calm
[45:00] he lives the message he talks to his
[45:02] family about the message he won't he's
[45:04] not stopping talking because they don't
[45:06] like what's being said
[45:08] but they know
[45:10] that for him the word of god comes first
[45:14] and
[45:16] they find a balance in that
[45:19] even though his wife doesn't yet believe
[45:20] the message
[45:22] would it be better if he just flew off
[45:24] the handle forced her hand
[45:26] and then the marriage was broken
[45:29] i think some people sometimes think that
[45:32] but i don't believe
[45:34] the heart of christ is that
[45:36] while we were yet sinners christ died
[45:38] for his bride while we were filthy
[45:41] rotten
[45:43] evil
[45:44] people
[45:46] christ died for us still
[45:49] and he forgave
[45:51] and he forgave and he forgave
[45:53] and he had patience and so i think
[45:55] that's
[45:56] an expression of leadership
[45:59] the leadership of christ is forgiveness
[46:03] and patience
[46:05] and that's what we men have to have
[46:08] and that's what you sisters have to have
[46:10] that's what a relationship there's
[46:12] patience there's forgiveness
[46:14] that takes place
[46:17] uh
[46:18] in satan's eden brother branham
[46:21] makes this statement that's what satan
[46:23] does he perverts the nations
[46:25] he perverts the nations so the culture
[46:28] the cultures of the world he perverts
[46:31] he perverts the church
[46:33] he perverts the people he's a deceiver
[46:36] a perverter of the original truth god
[46:38] made a man a man
[46:40] he made a woman a woman and he dressed
[46:42] them different and he meant for them to
[46:44] stay that way and to act that way one is
[46:47] feminish and the other
[46:49] is masculine
[46:51] brother bran um
[46:52] i had this question overseas asked me
[46:54] why is brother branham always
[46:57] harping on women
[47:00] and of course
[47:02] historically christians
[47:04] followed the bible but when it came to
[47:07] the 20th century
[47:08] out of world war one
[47:11] women started
[47:12] deviating from biblical standards
[47:15] because men said it was men preached
[47:18] that it was fine
[47:20] it was okay
[47:22] so the deviation happened in the 1920s
[47:26] and this is what carried forward so of
[47:28] course a prophet would have to come and
[47:30] correct it but previously they were
[47:32] following
[47:35] all of these things all of these things
[47:36] that we are teaching was just common
[47:41] you bear you didn't even have to teach
[47:42] it it was just just just the norm
[47:45] now it's not the norm so now a prophet
[47:47] has to rise up and come against it
[47:49] but as i'm looking and reviewing and
[47:53] studying i'm seeing
[47:55] what brother branham's talking about in
[47:56] the 1950s and 60s it was basically
[47:59] nothing
[48:01] compared to what it is today
[48:03] and why did he spend so much time over
[48:05] and over again speaking what he did
[48:08] about women
[48:09] i believe that the holy spirit
[48:12] knew what was going to happen
[48:14] in the future and was using him to bring
[48:17] correction to it
[48:20] it it's it just stuns me over and over
[48:23] again as i see it
[48:28] so
[48:29] as i said before men and women are equal
[48:32] but they're not the same
[48:34] men and women are literally different at
[48:36] the cellular level
[48:38] every cell
[48:40] of a woman's body
[48:42] is is marked female
[48:43] every
[48:44] cell cell of a man's body is marked
[48:49] male 1
[48:51] matt we talked about that before
[48:53] the weaker vessel men have denser bones
[48:56] larger hands greater
[48:58] muscle mass
[49:00] men tend to be more aggressive and as a
[49:03] result have a greater tendency to be
[49:05] attracted to conflict competition
[49:09] and as such leadership
[49:11] women tend to be attracted to nurturing
[49:14] and relationship building
[49:17] men tend to in their think way they
[49:19] think compartmentalize everything
[49:21] everything's
[49:22] separate and in a different box and they
[49:24] don't touch each other women just
[49:26] connect
[49:28] everything remember remember
[49:31] god made
[49:32] male and female
[49:34] in his own image so both of these are
[49:36] reflect a reflection
[49:38] of who god is right
[49:40] it's not better worse it's just
[49:43] different he made a man different from a
[49:46] woman both of them
[49:48] express something
[49:50] in the heart of god
[49:51] and when those things are out of balance
[49:55] and and are being handled unscripturally
[49:59] it's not expressing
[50:01] who god is
[50:02] it's
[50:03] what is sin
[50:05] falling short of the glory of god it's
[50:08] not
[50:08] expressing who god is
[50:10] god's law
[50:13] right is an expression of his nature
[50:16] so when we violate god's law
[50:20] we violate god's nature and that's why
[50:22] he says we've all sinned
[50:24] and come short of the glory of god we're
[50:26] to express the glory of god
[50:28] and when we sin we fall short
[50:31] of expressing the visible manifestation
[50:34] of the of who god is
[50:37] and so
[50:39] we're wired differently men are wired in
[50:42] such a way to lead women are wired to
[50:44] nurture
[50:46] or you could say within that
[50:48] influence
[50:50] right
[50:52] okay so first corinthians 6 9
[50:56] know ye not that the unrighteous shall
[50:58] not inherit the kingdom of god
[51:00] be not deceived neither fornicators
[51:03] nor idolaters nor adulterers
[51:07] nor effeminate nor abusers of themselves
[51:09] with mankind isn't that strange
[51:12] that paul
[51:13] puts in there
[51:15] a man
[51:16] that would act
[51:18] feminine
[51:19] as someone who will not
[51:21] inherit the kingdom of god
[51:25] we tend to think well
[51:27] well that man just
[51:29] today's culture we see someone act
[51:30] effeminate we say he's a homosexual
[51:33] right that's directly connected but if
[51:36] you look at the rest of this verse paul
[51:38] separates those homosexual and
[51:39] effeminate
[51:41] so a man that would act like a woman
[51:43] would have soft gestures like a woman it
[51:45] even speaks of the word effeminate there
[51:48] speaks of being soft
[51:51] right
[51:51] and so
[51:52] god wants a man brother branham even
[51:55] uses the word he made a man burly
[51:59] not burly williams i'm not talking about
[52:00] him
[52:02] he did make brother burly absolutely but
[52:05] he made a man to be
[52:08] burly he didn't make him to be like a
[52:10] woman
[52:11] and he says here that that would a man
[52:14] acting like a woman would disqualify him
[52:16] from inheriting the kingdom
[52:18] of god
[52:20] woe
[52:22] all right
[52:23] so our culture
[52:26] is feminized
[52:29] strongly feminized the portrait that we
[52:31] have
[52:33] in society is that men are self-centered
[52:35] dopes
[52:36] led by wise powerful
[52:39] and bossy women
[52:42] this is the general picture that you'll
[52:44] see
[52:45] in portrayed
[52:47] in sitcoms and movies
[52:50] and so forth i mean i know it's not
[52:52] everything we still have
[52:54] jack bauer and
[52:56] all these
[52:57] manly guys that are tough
[52:59] portrayed on tv too
[53:01] but in general when you see in relation
[53:03] to a woman
[53:05] you see a man as a self-centered dope
[53:07] that doesn't lead
[53:10] then we the next thing we have there is
[53:12] that video games
[53:15] video games
[53:16] are
[53:17] being used by the devil to deaden
[53:21] manliness
[53:24] to turn
[53:25] boys
[53:26] into perpetual
[53:28] boys
[53:30] and it's not something
[53:32] that god is pleased with
[53:34] for a man to be a boy
[53:37] i remember one time
[53:40] amy and i were went to a restaurant kind
[53:42] of in a vacation
[53:44] city up in minnesota
[53:46] and we were looking around and we saw
[53:49] i see all kinds of teenage girls but
[53:51] there's not a single
[53:53] teenage boy anywhere following around
[53:56] those girls or anywhere near him and i'm
[53:58] looking everywhere where's the teenage
[53:59] boys there's no teenage boys it's all
[54:02] girls
[54:03] what's going on here where are they
[54:05] they're playing video games they don't
[54:07] come out of their house anymore they
[54:08] don't care for
[54:09] anything
[54:10] but that it's it's an addiction
[54:13] to the point where it's total
[54:16] control
[54:17] over
[54:18] the lives of young young men
[54:21] and it's destructive
[54:23] i'm not saying you can't play a video
[54:24] game here and there as long as it's not
[54:27] an ungodly
[54:28] murderous wicked thing
[54:31] what i'm saying is addiction that leaves
[54:34] a boy
[54:35] a boy
[54:36] into his 30s you know
[54:38] i heard somebody
[54:39] mention oh the women the sisters here
[54:42] can't find any
[54:44] husbands because they're all still boys
[54:47] they they work into their 30s now
[54:49] waiting for those
[54:51] boys to become men because they're so
[54:53] addicted to video games
[54:55] what a sad state
[54:58] that's from a message church
[55:01] what a sad state i'm just warning you
[55:03] about video games
[55:04] don't let them become an addiction if
[55:06] they become an addiction
[55:08] burn them with fire and get them away
[55:11] get your
[55:12] especially get your boys away from those
[55:14] video games
[55:17] they're not going to make you a man son
[55:19] we're gonna make you a perpetual boy
[55:24] so women work and lead the family well
[55:26] the man works too
[55:28] but he remains disconnected unaware the
[55:31] quintessential american man
[55:34] he runs from his wife mo's the lawn
[55:38] runs from his wife goes to the store run
[55:40] runs from his wife drinks the drinks a
[55:42] beer
[55:44] runs from his wife so he can get away
[55:46] from her and be disconnected have his
[55:50] own stuff going on his fishing his
[55:53] hunting his
[55:54] video games his sports
[55:59] with his beer in his
[56:00] hand i s i some somewhere along the
[56:04] lines i think i had a family somewhere
[56:07] but
[56:08] who cares
[56:10] let me have another beer that's
[56:12] the picture that we find that
[56:14] disconnected man
[56:16] or the other picture you find is an
[56:18] effeminate man
[56:21] acts like a woman dresses like a woman
[56:23] sounds like a woman
[56:25] this is
[56:26] what
[56:27] the world wants
[56:28] a man to look like that's what they want
[56:31] to make
[56:32] normal
[56:33] and what's the normal woman portrayed in
[56:36] is
[56:37] she runs the family she works she cooks
[56:40] she cleans she does everything
[56:44] and she takes the leadership role
[56:46] because why the man has abdicated it
[56:52] not what god wants it's not god's
[56:54] picture it's not
[56:56] him
[56:57] and you say well we're message believers
[56:59] we won't do the same thing that's
[57:01] nonsense
[57:02] you think you're impervious
[57:05] to the work of the devil
[57:07] you think you're impervious to the
[57:08] influence of the
[57:10] a church
[57:12] where i mean where how many years after
[57:14] brother branham
[57:15] went off the scene
[57:17] churches will always slowly move away
[57:21] from
[57:23] following the word of god being on fire
[57:25] for god
[57:27] say well we're message believers it
[57:28] could never happen
[57:30] no
[57:31] you're wrong all of this stuff
[57:34] is influencing us
[57:36] in the message and unless we get on fire
[57:39] for the word
[57:42] and on fire for the power of god again
[57:45] the result is going to be a bunch of
[57:48] lukewarm
[57:49] dead
[57:50] churches with dead families
[57:52] with women who have taken the leadership
[57:54] role because the man has abdicated it
[57:57] the woman will always take the
[57:59] leadership role why she's not going to
[58:01] let her family be destroyed
[58:03] so she'll kick her husband in the rear
[58:05] end out of the house
[58:08] and run run the family
[58:10] men
[58:12] be men
[58:14] stop being boys
[58:16] provide for your family
[58:18] be tough
[58:20] be strong
[58:22] stand for the word of god in your home
[58:25] that's what god wants that's what he
[58:27] desires for each of us
[58:29] the identification that we have of
[58:32] masculinity in our culture is all of it
[58:35] is toxic
[58:36] so what is the result
[58:39] time to check out
[58:41] i can't even i can't do anything right
[58:43] i can't be right as a man
[58:46] so
[58:48] i'll check out
[58:50] either that or i'll become more like a
[58:52] woman
[58:53] than i can be a then i can be a bossy
[58:55] woman
[58:57] now again i'm charac i'm characterizing
[59:00] something as ridiculous right but you
[59:02] have to understand that there is
[59:06] there is a pendulum here
[59:08] and we swing on the pendulum that's
[59:10] where things are out of balance the
[59:11] pendulum starts to swing and then you go
[59:13] out of balance again
[59:15] you don't come back to the balance of
[59:17] the scripture
[59:19] right here
[59:20] true
[59:22] leadership
[59:23] in a home
[59:25] and true submission
[59:26] in a home
[59:28] base scripturally
[59:31] the church has also been feminized
[59:35] this is this is the one where i need the
[59:37] help of the lord because
[59:39] there's a balance to this
[59:41] there's a balance to this and i'm going
[59:42] to try to
[59:45] put that forward
[59:46] the church has been feminized
[59:49] spiritual in spirituality
[59:52] and in worship
[59:55] and what i mean by spirituality is that
[59:57] true spirituality
[59:59] is portrayed
[1:00:00] in a feminine
[1:00:02] way
[1:00:02] it's very touchy feely
[1:00:05] emotion
[1:00:06] based
[1:00:07] worship
[1:00:08] okay that's fine
[1:00:10] god made them male and female both
[1:00:13] expressions but he didn't just make them
[1:00:15] female just want to remind you that
[1:00:18] he also made them
[1:00:20] male
[1:00:22] the gospel in america
[1:00:24] and from what you from what i understand
[1:00:26] worldwide is becoming more self-help
[1:00:30] centered jesus came to give me
[1:00:33] unconditional emotive love
[1:00:35] regardless of my sinfulness
[1:00:39] and it's all about a personal
[1:00:41] relationship well there's not even a
[1:00:43] single scripture that says personal
[1:00:45] relationship in the entire bible
[1:00:47] now
[1:00:48] if you're a son of god you have a
[1:00:49] relationship with god right if you're
[1:00:51] the bride you have a relationship to
[1:00:53] christ i'm not taking that away
[1:00:55] absolutely as part of it it isn't all of
[1:00:57] it
[1:00:59] jesus said follow me
[1:01:01] and what did he do he trained his
[1:01:03] disciples to
[1:01:06] sit in pews
[1:01:08] and listen to very emotive
[1:01:10] music
[1:01:11] and lift their hands
[1:01:13] and go out to the buffet afterwards and
[1:01:16] enjoy themselves
[1:01:18] no he called us to be in the midst of a
[1:01:20] war
[1:01:22] and he told us you're going to suffer
[1:01:24] you're going to have pain you're going
[1:01:26] to have trials and tribulations
[1:01:28] jesus didn't come
[1:01:30] to take away
[1:01:31] all our emotional troubles
[1:01:34] he came to bring a sword
[1:01:37] and he put the sword in our hand
[1:01:39] because he has an eternal purpose to
[1:01:42] achieve
[1:01:44] he came to redeem a world that's
[1:01:48] literally given over to evil and all the
[1:01:50] people in it all al
[1:01:54] the people in it have committed
[1:01:57] high treason against an infinitely holy
[1:02:01] god
[1:02:02] who hates sin
[1:02:04] and evil and wants it destroyed and will
[1:02:06] destroy it in a lake of fire one day
[1:02:10] but jesus came
[1:02:12] to deal with my emotional trauma
[1:02:15] he did that's an effect
[1:02:18] but the reality is
[1:02:20] that's not what he came to do he came to
[1:02:23] offer himself as a sacrifice to an
[1:02:25] infinitely holy god who wanted to
[1:02:27] destroy sin and sinners with it
[1:02:33] he didn't come so you could feel better
[1:02:36] he came so that god could feel better
[1:02:40] he came that so that god
[1:02:42] could forgive your sin which separated
[1:02:46] from you from god
[1:02:47] we feel no horror over sin anymore
[1:02:51] in america
[1:02:52] sin is just it's a little it's a mistake
[1:02:54] brother john it's just a little mistake
[1:02:57] it sin is treason against god and it's
[1:03:00] god says you're dead
[1:03:04] you should y'all should go read the
[1:03:06] sermon sinners in the hands of an angry
[1:03:08] god one time by jonathan edwards
[1:03:12] you'll have a different viewpoint
[1:03:14] of the cross and of christ
[1:03:18] now
[1:03:18] part of that
[1:03:20] part of what christ did was he came to
[1:03:23] heal
[1:03:25] brokenness
[1:03:26] absolutely
[1:03:28] but don't take that
[1:03:31] and make that the only thing we talk
[1:03:33] about and preach about
[1:03:35] we also have the aspect that god is
[1:03:37] infinitely holy
[1:03:39] and he hates and is angered about sin
[1:03:42] every sin he hates it
[1:03:46] even the sin that you do now
[1:03:48] that i do now he hates it
[1:03:51] and he had to
[1:03:54] torture
[1:03:56] and kill
[1:03:57] his son
[1:03:59] he came in that son
[1:04:01] and went and received torturing and
[1:04:03] killing and
[1:04:06] and
[1:04:06] he was brutalized
[1:04:09] so that you could receive forgiveness
[1:04:12] it's not all about
[1:04:14] you
[1:04:16] it's about what god
[1:04:19] did to redeem a world that's broken
[1:04:24] and destroyed by sin and must be burned
[1:04:26] with fire
[1:04:30] god loves you
[1:04:32] he does
[1:04:33] he also hates sin
[1:04:36] and we don't we don't lose track of that
[1:04:38] don't be so influenced by laodicea
[1:04:41] that you just call it's a mistake
[1:04:45] it's a sin
[1:04:47] against god view it the right way it's
[1:04:49] high treason
[1:04:51] and what is treason punishable in
[1:04:53] america by death
[1:04:55] what does god say treason against him is
[1:04:57] punishable by
[1:04:59] death
[1:05:01] don't get it wrong
[1:05:04] don't look at it wrong
[1:05:07] that's uncomfortable
[1:05:08] to talk about it's uncomfortable to say
[1:05:11] but it's the truth
[1:05:14] your preacher is not sent to make you
[1:05:17] feel happy
[1:05:18] your preacher is sent to put you in
[1:05:20] right relationship with an infinitely
[1:05:23] holy god
[1:05:25] that sent his son to be tortured and
[1:05:27] murdered so that your sins could be
[1:05:29] forgiven
[1:05:33] and as a result of receiving
[1:05:36] that holy spirit
[1:05:38] he heals us
[1:05:40] he touches our heart he changes our
[1:05:42] heart he puts us in a personal walk
[1:05:46] of fellowship
[1:05:49] with him
[1:05:51] of leadership by
[1:05:53] him
[1:05:55] and guess what he also brings lots of
[1:05:58] brother matt preached on i think was
[1:06:00] that
[1:06:01] last weekend or the weekend before
[1:06:04] he preached on wednesday wednesday
[1:06:08] it was awesome one day and a half ago
[1:06:10] i've been gone for a week
[1:06:12] sometime matt preached on it
[1:06:16] and it was amazing god
[1:06:18] sends us
[1:06:20] trials
[1:06:22] he doesn't come to take away all trouble
[1:06:26] all pain all hurt sometimes he sends us
[1:06:30] trials
[1:06:31] pain and hurt to do what
[1:06:35] to grow us to cause us to grow
[1:06:37] in him
[1:06:39] it's not to hurt us
[1:06:40] it's to grow us
[1:06:43] right because it's not to hurt us
[1:06:45] because
[1:06:47] jesus died
[1:06:49] on a cross
[1:06:50] so that you when god looked at you
[1:06:53] he didn't see you in your sin
[1:06:56] and the evil that's in your life but
[1:06:58] instead
[1:07:00] he looks at jesus christ and says
[1:07:03] perfectly righteous perfectly holy
[1:07:07] forgiven
[1:07:08] not just forgiven
[1:07:09] just justified
[1:07:12] as just as if you've never sinned in the
[1:07:13] first place
[1:07:16] but don't
[1:07:17] get so
[1:07:18] full of yourself
[1:07:19] to think you didn't sin because you did
[1:07:22] be humble
[1:07:24] understand you did sin you are sinning
[1:07:27] and you're gonna continue doing so until
[1:07:29] you have a new body
[1:07:30] that should keep us humble
[1:07:36] okay so back to the back to the trying
[1:07:39] to give a big picture let's come back to
[1:07:41] this
[1:07:42] the gospel is not self-help that
[1:07:45] shouldn't be the focus of our preaching
[1:07:47] if that's the focus of our preaching
[1:07:49] it's not balanced
[1:07:51] self-help
[1:07:53] it's not even self-help it's god
[1:07:56] coming in your brokenness
[1:07:58] to heal you
[1:08:00] all right
[1:08:02] but that's not the whole reason he came
[1:08:05] that's a fruit
[1:08:07] of the very reason that he came is to
[1:08:09] restore
[1:08:11] a people elected people
[1:08:13] and a world
[1:08:14] back to
[1:08:16] perfect condition again
[1:08:19] now
[1:08:20] we have hurt
[1:08:22] now we have pain
[1:08:24] and god puts bits in that pain
[1:08:27] bits in the mouth of that pain that
[1:08:30] struggle that trial that tribulation
[1:08:32] in order to
[1:08:34] perfect you
[1:08:36] in order to cleanse you and clean you
[1:08:40] it's not so that something's wrong
[1:08:43] if you're suffering something's wrong if
[1:08:45] you're not suffering
[1:08:47] because god he pro jesus said in this
[1:08:49] world you'll have trouble
[1:08:52] we can say amen to all the rest of the
[1:08:54] word of god but we don't want to say
[1:08:55] amen to that
[1:08:57] in this world
[1:08:58] you have trouble but be of good cheer i
[1:09:01] have overcome the world
[1:09:03] trouble hurts trouble is painful
[1:09:06] trouble
[1:09:07] is not fun
[1:09:10] but god uses that
[1:09:13] to make us more like jesus
[1:09:18] it's not all about a feeling it's not
[1:09:20] all about
[1:09:21] emotions that is part of it that goes
[1:09:24] along with it but that isn't it
[1:09:28] that's that's the balance american and
[1:09:31] christianity around the world
[1:09:33] church around the world
[1:09:34] it's all about
[1:09:36] the feeling that's produced on sunday
[1:09:38] the performance that takes place
[1:09:41] the
[1:09:43] emotionalized relationship between
[1:09:46] christ and the believer
[1:09:50] the touchy feely aspect is there an
[1:09:52] aspect to that i mean i think we can
[1:09:54] read song of solomon and i think we can
[1:09:56] read
[1:09:57] different scriptures and in the psalms
[1:09:59] and so forth where we see
[1:10:01] there is there's deep
[1:10:03] emotion between a believer
[1:10:05] and christ absolutely
[1:10:07] that's not what it's all about
[1:10:10] that's not the center of everything
[1:10:11] that's not the focus
[1:10:14] of
[1:10:14] of everything
[1:10:16] but in america
[1:10:18] that has become
[1:10:20] the main focus the drawing factor
[1:10:23] and you hear the praise and worship
[1:10:25] songs not all of them
[1:10:27] but many
[1:10:28] so focused on that touchy
[1:10:31] feely
[1:10:32] aspect of things that it might speak to
[1:10:35] a woman's heart
[1:10:38] that's fine and that's good that's good
[1:10:40] we need god to speak to a woman's heart
[1:10:42] but if that's all that we're getting
[1:10:43] it's not speaking really
[1:10:45] to a man's heart
[1:10:49] uh
[1:10:50] i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna stop there
[1:10:52] i don't want to go out of balance
[1:10:54] david merrell
[1:10:56] an author says in today's church the
[1:10:57] gospel is no longer
[1:10:59] about saving the world against
[1:11:00] impossible odds
[1:11:02] it's about finding a happy relationship
[1:11:05] with a wonderful man
[1:11:08] that's the picture that's being painted
[1:11:09] i believe in in
[1:11:11] christianity today
[1:11:18] let me see here what happened
[1:11:29] all right let's let's continue let's
[1:11:31] just i want to bring that
[1:11:33] thought to a close
[1:11:34] before i move on talk about
[1:11:37] biblical note and womanhood
[1:11:39] in more detail
[1:11:40] it's important
[1:11:42] the church has become feminized and what
[1:11:45] i'm saying is that it's taken one aspect
[1:11:50] of who god is
[1:11:52] and so emphasize that and push that to
[1:11:55] the forefront
[1:11:56] that it's it's literally causing
[1:11:59] irreparable damage
[1:12:03] to the church
[1:12:04] now to the bride
[1:12:06] it might it might it's coming against
[1:12:08] the bride
[1:12:09] but the true bride is going to receive
[1:12:11] the correction of the lord
[1:12:13] and come back into the right balance
[1:12:15] like i said before
[1:12:17] you won't find anywhere in scripture the
[1:12:19] word personal relationship brother
[1:12:21] branham mentions it but you know what
[1:12:23] brother branham mentions mostly
[1:12:26] fellowship
[1:12:28] fellowship with god
[1:12:29] he doesn't go that direction of personal
[1:12:32] relationship touchy feely he goes to
[1:12:35] there's a fellowship
[1:12:37] which produces a relationship it's his
[1:12:39] leadership his direction but brother
[1:12:41] branham's favorite way of talking about
[1:12:44] our connection to god is
[1:12:46] fellowship that's what god made us for
[1:12:49] is for fellowship and worship
[1:12:55] but again
[1:12:57] that's broken we have to understand it's
[1:12:59] broken
[1:13:00] god didn't make you for fellowship and
[1:13:02] leave you in a sinful wicked state
[1:13:04] that's not what he wants
[1:13:06] that's not what he's looking for
[1:13:09] god
[1:13:10] let's put it this way
[1:13:13] we we hear this god will accept you
[1:13:16] just as you are actually he won't
[1:13:19] he never would
[1:13:22] he never would accept you just as you
[1:13:25] are that otherwise jesus we didn't need
[1:13:27] jesus
[1:13:29] as you are
[1:13:31] you're a sinner
[1:13:32] and you're separated from god that's as
[1:13:34] you are
[1:13:36] he doesn't accept you as you are
[1:13:38] what does he do
[1:13:40] he makes a way
[1:13:41] so that he can accept you jesus had to
[1:13:45] be
[1:13:46] tortured on a cross
[1:13:49] executed
[1:13:51] in the most shameful
[1:13:53] painful way that man has ever devised
[1:13:56] satan has ever devised
[1:13:58] for a man to die in order that he could
[1:14:01] accept you
[1:14:03] get it right well he just accepts me as
[1:14:05] whereas where i am
[1:14:08] because
[1:14:09] because of the blood of jesus christ
[1:14:12] if you just say he accepts me as i am
[1:14:14] you're wrong
[1:14:15] he accepts me as i am because there's a
[1:14:18] sacrifice
[1:14:19] because there's an infinitely holy god
[1:14:21] that couldn't accept me
[1:14:23] that's why jesus came
[1:14:26] stopped with the self-help garbage
[1:14:30] let's get our stop being baptized in
[1:14:33] self-help of american americanized
[1:14:36] christianity
[1:14:38] that's spread through the whole world
[1:14:40] jesus loves you god loved you so much
[1:14:44] he loved you so much
[1:14:46] because you're elect
[1:14:50] he doesn't love everybody
[1:14:55] what
[1:14:56] no he doesn't love everybody can you
[1:14:58] find can you find a scripture that says
[1:15:00] god loves everyone
[1:15:05] jacob have i love but esau have i
[1:15:08] disliked no hated
[1:15:12] he hates sin
[1:15:14] and well he hate the sin and love the
[1:15:16] sinner
[1:15:17] god hates the sin and hates the sinner
[1:15:21] and will destroy them both both their
[1:15:23] sin and them
[1:15:25] okay we have all these phrases
[1:15:27] all these americanized
[1:15:29] phrases
[1:15:30] that have become scripture and they're
[1:15:32] not scripture
[1:15:34] god so loved the world jason he said god
[1:15:36] so loved the world who's the world
[1:15:38] who did he die for
[1:15:42] the whole world
[1:15:43] which whole world if you love the whole
[1:15:45] world then and put the blood on the
[1:15:47] whole world then the whole world is
[1:15:49] going to be saved
[1:15:50] who's the world that he's talking about
[1:15:53] the elect
[1:15:56] what did what did what did they what did
[1:15:58] he say he came to do what save his
[1:16:01] people
[1:16:02] from their sins his people
[1:16:05] his elect so what is the world that
[1:16:07] we're talking about
[1:16:09] god so loved the world that he gave his
[1:16:11] only begotten son it's his elect
[1:16:15] he said he hated jacob or he hated esau
[1:16:19] that's a type of the those who are not
[1:16:23] chosen by god
[1:16:25] again i i'm i'm maybe i'm being shocking
[1:16:28] to you a little a little bit
[1:16:31] but the reality is we've got our minds
[1:16:34] have to be cleansed by the holy spirit
[1:16:36] and renewed
[1:16:38] by god
[1:16:40] god
[1:16:41] wants us
[1:16:43] to love everyone
[1:16:44] and in a sense also god loves everyone
[1:16:47] in what sense not in a redemptive sense
[1:16:50] but he loves them in the sense that he
[1:16:52] provides
[1:16:53] for their needs he makes the sun rise on
[1:16:55] the just
[1:16:56] and the unjust he wants us
[1:16:59] to do the same thing he wants to us to
[1:17:02] love our enemies to take care of our
[1:17:05] enemies to pray for our enemies and
[1:17:07] those who persecute us
[1:17:09] but god
[1:17:11] is different than us did you know that
[1:17:14] god's different than you
[1:17:18] god isn't exactly like us
[1:17:20] he's on a different level he commands us
[1:17:23] to love everyone
[1:17:26] but
[1:17:26] the fact is we read in scripture that
[1:17:28] god hates
[1:17:31] i'm really uncomfortable now
[1:17:36] it's getting hot in here
[1:17:42] let's be okay with the word of god
[1:17:45] let's be okay with what god said
[1:17:48] let's get rid of our own thinking and
[1:17:50] our own way of looking at things
[1:17:52] and let's stop being influenced by
[1:17:55] memeology
[1:17:59] the theology of memes
[1:18:02] we love the lord right
[1:18:04] we want to follow his word right we
[1:18:06] don't want to be in conformity to the
[1:18:08] way the world or american christianity
[1:18:10] is preaching to us
[1:18:13] be careful
[1:18:14] you know that god gave you a brain
[1:18:17] and he wants you to use it
[1:18:21] what am i saying is i'm saying there's
[1:18:23] disc you need to have discernment
[1:18:25] biblical
[1:18:27] discernment
[1:18:28] you need to be able to
[1:18:30] sister
[1:18:32] teenage girl
[1:18:34] teenage boy mean to be able to look at
[1:18:37] something
[1:18:38] on the internet
[1:18:40] i'm giving you a grand revelation right
[1:18:42] now
[1:18:44] just wait for it the holy spirit is
[1:18:46] moving
[1:18:51] he is he is moving not trying to tell a
[1:18:54] joke
[1:18:55] [Applause]
[1:18:56] but we identify the holy spirit moving
[1:18:59] with some emotion
[1:19:01] the word of god is be coming forward the
[1:19:03] holy spirit's working
[1:19:07] get out of get out of your emotions
[1:19:09] feelings etc god gives emotions the word
[1:19:12] produces emotions
[1:19:14] but that's not what it's all about
[1:19:17] the the word of god
[1:19:20] has to be our final authority
[1:19:23] we have to stand on that
[1:19:26] we can't stand on our emotions
[1:19:28] god is not going to call you in in in
[1:19:32] before the white throne and say did you
[1:19:33] follow your emotions
[1:19:40] but
[1:19:40] american the the world acts like that's
[1:19:43] what's going to happen did you follow
[1:19:44] your dreams
[1:19:46] what brother jason was talking about
[1:19:48] on
[1:19:48] wednesday make sure your dreams
[1:19:52] are
[1:19:54] put aside
[1:19:55] we're following christ
[1:19:59] that's that's me
[1:20:01] if you want to follow your dreams follow
[1:20:03] them i want to follow christ
[1:20:06] i want to be led by him
[1:20:08] i want to be found on that day say you
[1:20:10] you put your you laid your emotions
[1:20:12] aside
[1:20:13] you laid what you felt about things
[1:20:15] aside and you took my word and you lived
[1:20:18] it that's what i want that's what i want
[1:20:19] to hear
[1:20:21] look at the look at the whole bible
[1:20:23] again i'm not attacking i'm not trying
[1:20:25] to attack
[1:20:27] the way our sisters
[1:20:29] look at things
[1:20:30] what i am trying to do is let's come
[1:20:33] back to a balance
[1:20:36] women would look at things more
[1:20:37] emotionally
[1:20:39] god made you that way
[1:20:40] he also but he'd make you
[1:20:43] to follow that above the word of god
[1:20:46] he made you that way to help your man
[1:20:49] understand things better your husband
[1:20:51] understand things better
[1:20:53] right
[1:20:54] because we don't unders we don't see the
[1:20:56] connectedness we don't see
[1:20:58] necessarily the emotional side
[1:21:00] so he gives us a wife
[1:21:03] to help us understand but we're not
[1:21:05] supposed to put emotion
[1:21:07] above the bible
[1:21:09] feeling
[1:21:10] above the bible and that's the danger
[1:21:12] that's the that's what i'm saying
[1:21:14] is there emotion yep
[1:21:17] is there is there pain
[1:21:19] is there hurt
[1:21:22] is there struggles is there emotional
[1:21:24] highs and lows yeah
[1:21:26] we're not supposed to live on any of
[1:21:28] them and we're not supposed to find our
[1:21:30] value
[1:21:32] as individuals based on them
[1:21:35] again
[1:21:37] we have to bring this thing into
[1:21:39] balance
[1:21:41] he made them male and female god made
[1:21:43] them male and female in the beginning he
[1:21:45] didn't make them only male
[1:21:47] i didn't make them only female
[1:21:50] i think the church today wants it to be
[1:21:52] only female
[1:21:54] that's not how god made us
[1:21:56] that's not how
[1:21:58] he works
[1:22:01] genesis 2
[1:22:03] 24
[1:22:06] therefore
[1:22:07] shall a man now this is
[1:22:09] before the fall
[1:22:11] okay
[1:22:12] this is before sin this is before
[1:22:15] heartache it's before any any of that
[1:22:18] therefore shall a man leave his father
[1:22:21] and his mother and shall cleave unto his
[1:22:23] wife
[1:22:24] and they shall be one flesh this is
[1:22:26] god's original
[1:22:28] purpose and remember i think we
[1:22:30] mentioned this before
[1:22:32] what was
[1:22:34] eve's name
[1:22:36] before the fall
[1:22:39] her name was adam
[1:22:42] she had one
[1:22:43] the same name as her husband
[1:22:46] she didn't have a different name they
[1:22:47] were
[1:22:48] to be one they were identified
[1:22:51] in one this was god's purpose from the
[1:22:54] very
[1:22:55] beginning this is god's heart
[1:22:57] from the very beginning man eve
[1:23:00] his parents
[1:23:01] it's not a bad thing needs to leave
[1:23:03] their influence
[1:23:05] their direction their control
[1:23:08] and to
[1:23:09] cleave to his wife so that they can be
[1:23:13] one all right
[1:23:15] that's before the fall god made adam
[1:23:17] first
[1:23:18] and then eve that's paul's argument
[1:23:21] for the headship of man
[1:23:23] he made adam first and then eve
[1:23:25] all right so god's purpose from the
[1:23:28] beginning before the fall was the
[1:23:30] headship of man
[1:23:32] and submission of woman it's not a post
[1:23:35] fall thing
[1:23:36] i want you to look at this next verse
[1:23:38] genesis 3 16 now the here is after the
[1:23:41] fall
[1:23:42] and here comes the punishment
[1:23:46] unto the woman he said i will greatly
[1:23:48] multiply
[1:23:49] thy sorrow and thy conception
[1:23:52] in sorrow
[1:23:53] thou shalt bring forth children
[1:23:56] and thy desire shall be to thy husband
[1:23:58] and he shall rule over thee okay so
[1:24:03] what what is
[1:24:05] how can that be
[1:24:07] god's curse
[1:24:09] if
[1:24:11] if
[1:24:13] he made a man to be the head of the
[1:24:15] woman from the beginning
[1:24:18] okay seems strange
[1:24:20] but i want you to understand this word
[1:24:22] rule there
[1:24:24] is
[1:24:26] different it's not what you think it is
[1:24:28] it speaks of
[1:24:30] ruling with harshness
[1:24:33] ruling with rigor
[1:24:36] in other words what you see from the
[1:24:38] point of the fall
[1:24:40] this is the curse man what was the curse
[1:24:42] of that god put upon man thorns and
[1:24:45] thistles
[1:24:47] he disobeyed in his headship of all
[1:24:49] creation
[1:24:51] and therefore received the all of
[1:24:53] creation was made subject to vanity
[1:24:56] subject to decay all right so that was
[1:24:59] man's
[1:25:01] curse
[1:25:02] woman's curse was
[1:25:05] your desire shall be to your husband
[1:25:07] he'll rule over you
[1:25:09] so i said that
[1:25:10] before a man gets thorns and thistles
[1:25:14] and a woman gets
[1:25:15] a husband
[1:25:20] well a husband that rules with rigor and
[1:25:23] harshness
[1:25:25] if you look at the history of the world
[1:25:26] that's that's absolutely the case
[1:25:29] jesus came to bring redemption
[1:25:34] to change to change things to turn
[1:25:36] things around
[1:25:37] and paul said in christ there's neither
[1:25:39] male or female
[1:25:41] jesus demonstrated the the value and the
[1:25:44] worth
[1:25:45] of women in his personal ministry
[1:25:47] he didn't relegate them to have their
[1:25:50] word and their testimony is meaningless
[1:25:52] he didn't put them in that level he gave
[1:25:54] them an equality that
[1:25:57] scarcely the world does today
[1:26:00] in fact they don't
[1:26:02] and so when we look at this what is what
[1:26:05] is the curse that her desire her desire
[1:26:08] went away from her husband
[1:26:09] to the serpent producing the serpent
[1:26:11] seed
[1:26:12] so so there's that aspect in other words
[1:26:16] now that the curse has come
[1:26:18] now that sin is here
[1:26:20] you being the weaker vessel are going to
[1:26:22] be completely reliant on this man to
[1:26:25] protect you now
[1:26:27] the whole world has not been as it is in
[1:26:28] america
[1:26:31] as it is now
[1:26:33] things are vastly different what am i
[1:26:35] meaning
[1:26:36] at one point in time all you were trying
[1:26:38] to do was survive
[1:26:41] you were trying to find food
[1:26:45] raise food
[1:26:47] and live
[1:26:49] much more reliant on the strength of a
[1:26:52] man
[1:26:53] now in our
[1:26:54] society today it's almost
[1:26:56] to the other than in sports it's almost
[1:26:58] meaningless unfortunately
[1:27:01] but
[1:27:02] because of the fall and because of the
[1:27:04] sin her desire will be her husband she
[1:27:06] needs to look to her husband for safety
[1:27:08] protection
[1:27:09] and as a res and then in turn he's going
[1:27:12] to rule over her with rigor
[1:27:15] now the apostle paul in
[1:27:20] let me get there colossians 3
[1:27:23] 18. i'm going to skip around because i'm
[1:27:25] going to try to close
[1:27:27] shortly wives submit yourselves and your
[1:27:29] own husbands
[1:27:30] as it is fit in the lord
[1:27:33] husbands love your wives and be not
[1:27:36] bitter against them this is
[1:27:39] speaking of harshness
[1:27:42] so ruling
[1:27:44] with do not embitter
[1:27:46] against them
[1:27:48] so
[1:27:49] husbands are to love their wives and not
[1:27:51] embitter them in other in other words
[1:27:53] not to rule with rigor over them
[1:27:58] so
[1:27:58] this is really the antidote this is a
[1:28:01] redemption
[1:28:03] this is the proper picture now of christ
[1:28:07] and the church not ruling with rigor
[1:28:10] but with
[1:28:12] self-sacrifice with
[1:28:15] love
[1:28:16] i'm not talking about emotional love i'm
[1:28:19] talking about putting someone else's
[1:28:21] needs
[1:28:22] above your own the way jesus
[1:28:24] and the apostles speak about love
[1:28:27] not love as an emotion
[1:28:30] but love as an act
[1:28:32] an action word
[1:28:34] that's what love is
[1:28:36] husbands love
[1:28:38] not the emotive type of love yes that's
[1:28:41] there that comes that's a part of it
[1:28:43] right
[1:28:44] it should be
[1:28:46] but that's not what this love is talking
[1:28:49] about it's a
[1:28:51] self-sacrificing
[1:28:53] giving
[1:28:54] love that looks to the good
[1:28:56] and the need of others and goes and
[1:28:58] meets it regardless of whether it's
[1:28:59] asked for or not
[1:29:01] right
[1:29:02] and then it says be not harsh
[1:29:06] don't rule them with rigor
[1:29:08] lead
[1:29:10] with
[1:29:12] love self-sacrificing
[1:29:14] love musicians if you'd come
[1:29:19] ephesians 5.
[1:29:24] wives submit yourselves unto your own
[1:29:28] husbands
[1:29:30] as unto the lord now look
[1:29:34] your submission to your husband
[1:29:37] is showing that you're doing it as unto
[1:29:39] the lord
[1:29:41] your submission to your husband isn't
[1:29:43] because he's worthy or valuable
[1:29:46] or needs to have it your submission to
[1:29:49] your husband is because the lord is
[1:29:51] commanding it
[1:29:54] that's part of your obedience
[1:29:56] to christ part of my obedience to christ
[1:29:59] as a our obedience as husbands
[1:30:01] is to lead
[1:30:03] with
[1:30:04] self-sacrificing love
[1:30:07] for the husband is the head of the wife
[1:30:09] even as
[1:30:10] christ is the head of the church and he
[1:30:12] is the savior
[1:30:13] of the body you're supposed to you're
[1:30:15] you're called you're charged by god
[1:30:18] to love your wife as your own body
[1:30:21] no man never hated his own body but
[1:30:24] nourishes
[1:30:25] and cherishes it so does christ the
[1:30:26] church that is what we as men that's
[1:30:29] that's the kind of
[1:30:31] love we're to have to our wives always
[1:30:34] having her
[1:30:36] best interest in heart now not her
[1:30:39] emotional
[1:30:40] need but the looking at the eternal need
[1:30:44] more than anything else
[1:30:46] right
[1:30:47] not just not just being ruled around
[1:30:50] by the emotions that your wife is
[1:30:53] feeling
[1:30:54] we're to be led by christ
[1:30:56] right
[1:30:57] and sometimes your wife
[1:31:00] all of us sometimes our emotions are
[1:31:02] true
[1:31:03] sometimes our emotions are false
[1:31:06] we have to help each other
[1:31:08] in those things
[1:31:10] so that all of our
[1:31:12] actions and acts are according to
[1:31:14] scripture that's love
[1:31:18] love is not being carried about the nose
[1:31:21] by every
[1:31:22] emotion every feeling everything that
[1:31:24] happens
[1:31:26] that's not love
[1:31:27] love is corrective love is kind love is
[1:31:30] patient
[1:31:32] love has tenderness
[1:31:34] so there there is a submission
[1:31:37] and there's a leadership
[1:31:39] man you can't abdicate the leadership of
[1:31:41] your family if you do i promise you your
[1:31:43] wife will take it and then you'll
[1:31:45] complain against her for being being
[1:31:47] bossy get
[1:31:49] off the couch
[1:31:51] get off your lazy rear end
[1:31:53] and lead your family
[1:31:58] god wants you to be active
[1:32:00] to be doing something that's why i said
[1:32:02] love is an action
[1:32:07] and i'm convicting myself i'm pointing
[1:32:08] out at you and there's five fingers
[1:32:10] pointing back at me four fingers i
[1:32:12] should say i don't have six figures
[1:32:19] god love god loves us
[1:32:21] god cares for us
[1:32:24] he sometimes he expresses that love by
[1:32:28] giving us hard spankings
[1:32:32] and we have to be thankful for that kind
[1:32:34] of love
[1:32:35] otherwise if we didn't have that kind of
[1:32:36] love we'd be considered bastards in
[1:32:38] other words we're not children of god
[1:32:40] somebody else's child
[1:32:42] and so we want to be in a position where
[1:32:45] we can
[1:32:46] take correction and we can appreciate it
[1:32:48] that's the zeal of the laodicean the
[1:32:51] true believers of the laodicean age
[1:32:54] their zeal is they
[1:32:55] what
[1:32:56] they repent
[1:32:58] be zealous therefore
[1:33:00] and repent
[1:33:02] this is an onslaught that we're facing
[1:33:04] right now
[1:33:05] this spirit of this age an onslaught of
[1:33:10] feminization that's taking place
[1:33:12] and we have to be
[1:33:15] careful we have to be wise we have to be
[1:33:18] discerning
[1:33:19] again as i spoke we it's about balance
[1:33:23] we don't want to take it and swing the
[1:33:25] pendulum and say well because the world
[1:33:27] is feminizing the gospel we're just
[1:33:30] going to masculinate it and that's
[1:33:32] that's all we're going to have that's
[1:33:33] what the devil would have us do swing
[1:33:35] the pendulum all the way back here no
[1:33:37] it's in the middle
[1:33:39] we have to be balanced
[1:33:40] we have to be wise and discerning
