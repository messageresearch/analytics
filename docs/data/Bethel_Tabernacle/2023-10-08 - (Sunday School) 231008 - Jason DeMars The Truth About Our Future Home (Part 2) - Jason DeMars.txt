TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] morning everyone God bless you let's stand and pray gracious Heavenly Father we just come before you Lord and we're so thank thankful for your mercy and Grace Lord we ask that your presence be with us this morning Lord that you would come upon your word Lord and and take it and make it alive and real in our hearts father just uh ask that you'd help us to step out of the way Lord uh put the the cares of this world and the cares of this life to the side that we would focus on you Lord we commit our time to You For Your Glory we ask in jesus' name amen all right brother Mark if you want to bring up the PowerPoint we'll just uh as you're standing um we'll go ahead and and read the scripture in uh 2 Corinthians chapter 5 and we'll read verses 1- 4 for we know that if our Earthly House of this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of God a house not made with hands Eternal in the heavens for in this we groan earnestly Desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from Heaven if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked for we that are in this Tabernacle do groan being burdened not for that we would be unclothed but clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed up of life amen may the Lord add the blessing to the reading of his word you can be seated we're looking this is part two we're looking at our future home revealed we often say things like we lost our mom or we lost our brother or we lost our uh whatever it might be relative and um I think we should stop talking this way because that's not the reality and we're going to be on I think screen number 22 is where we started brother Mark um we didn't lose those those those who are Christians we didn't lose them we know exactly where they are and uh we're we're not we can't see them we can't be where they're at but we know exactly where they are it's it's not a loss um to us now it feels that way but Through The Eyes of faith we didn't lose anything I didn't lose my mom a few months ago I know exactly where she is she's a she's a Christian she she she's still a Christian and she's in in the presence of the Lord and she's at she's she's taking a rest and so I I I of course I'm I'm sad every day everyone can probably relate that's lost somebody that's close a parent or a grandparent I I I miss my mother every day I almost the day doesn't go by I think oh I should talk to her about this or I should talk to her about that and well I can't now but I will there'll be one day we'll be we'll be reunited so it's it's not as though we lost them and I think we should stop speaking those words from our mouth and erase that from our vocabulary they've gone on ahead we're going to we're going to meet them we'll catch up with them soon as we read in that scripture I'm going to just uh try to get forward there I lost it my PowerPoint don't like me this is the second time this has happened but as we looked at that scripture 2 Corinthians 5 if you want to turn if you have your Bible turn turn there with me speaks of the Earthly House of this Tabernacle it's not it's not speaking of our home address the Earthly Tabernacle that it's speaking of is this body this house if it's dissolved we're told that we have a building of God or if you look at this verse a building from God in other words God is building something that's what the that's what the scripture is speaking of not as though it's an intact fully developed building but as we learn from brother brandham in things that are to be as we hear the word as we're convicted in our hearts over the word God is adding word on top of word building that theophany for us and so God is building that's it's it's speaking of a process of building we have that building buing and God is building in the process of building it but then the next very next thing tells us something connected to building that seems so strange it says it's Eternal in the heavens so how can you be Eternal and also be a building because God's word says so he's building us he's he's transforming us and as he's transforming up the our character here a body a theophany is being built there that body that's being built there is actually based off of what God had in his mind for all of eternity that body has always existed no not as a dis separate being but was a part of God's own life and so when this one is dissolved we have an already waiting is how brother brandham spoke of it it's already waiting for us in this one we grown and I think this is the this is the the heart and the vision of a Christian this is what Paul viewed things like is I'm groaning in this body earnestly Desiring to be clothed upon with that house which is eternal in the heavens earnestly Desiring to go into his theophany see we're doing everything we can to run away and be fearful of death we got to that's got to change in our hearts death is not our enemy anymore since what Jesus Christ did for us on Calvary and God raised him from the dead death has no sting or it shouldn't anymore to to the heart and mind of a Christian death has no Victory the grave has no victory over us anymore it in itself is part of our Victory it's just another path of our journey I love this Exchange in The Lord of the Rings between Pippen and Gandalf Pippen says they're in a place where they are totally destroyed and everything is seems like it's lost and they're all going to die they're being surrounded by the enemy and Pippen says I didn't think it was going to end this way Gandalf looks at him and says end no the journey doesn't end here death is just another path one that we all must take the gray rain curtain of this world rolls back and all change to Silver glass and then you see it Pippen says what Gandalf see what white Shores and Beyond the far Green Country under a swift Sunrise Pippen says well that isn't so bad Gandalf responds no no it isn't see death is merely another part of our Jour a continuation of our journey we we we we fear it we do everything we can to avoid it well let's put it this way I want to be here as long as God wants me to be here when it's time for me to go I want to go not fearful not upset I want to go with my hands raised and saying thank you Jesus enough of this pest house I want to go to my father's house it's just another part of our journey it's a continuation it's not the end of the journey it's not a finishing thing it is a continuation it's a it's part of the fruition of this journey until we get to that new body ultimately that's that's our final destination is that new body on a new Earth on a renewed Earth a redeemed Earth in Philippians 1:23 Paul writes for I am a in a straight betwix two having a desire to depart and to be with Christ Which is far better amen think about that for a second what is your desire what is your heart as a believer is do you have a desire to depart and to be with Christ and do you view that as far better than staying here amen unfortunately many of us uh me included very few times think and feel that way that's my doctrine that I hold for myself and I I'm I'm asking the Lord to renew my heart into what I believe is true and what I know is true so that body that's prepared for us is not another person it's not a new start it's not a new beginning it's actually simply us us continuing in a different form and a different shape same REM same remor same person same calling same desires same likes only now we're not in a body that is pushing us towards sin and evil that flesh body is is gone as brother brandham calls it a pest house we're living this body is a pest house as much as we try to take care of it and be good stewards of it yet at the same time we know it's simply a pest house and this one it's going to have to either be changed or rot and we go we go into that theophany it's this we're the very same person we look the same we have the same name we have the same likes and dislikes only all things will be purified based on the character that's in the heart see the flesh battles against that true character that's in the soul constantly when we go to that theophany when we go to our new body the The Immortal body those those fleshly fleshly sinful desires are completely gone today we have to Die daily that's because of this the flesh the nature of our of our soul there's still a sinful nature there within us in the future home brother brandom says death doesn't change you death only changes your Dwelling Place amen I want to change my Dwelling Place I'm tired of this old world Amen I'm tired of this battle with sin I want to be set free from this body of Flesh that's continually pushing me towards sin there's something inside saying this is not right I can't do this can't be this can't be the way a person must live this can't be the battle that we constantly have to face thank God we have the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ Luke 16 now we're looking at and and I I guess I have a chart on the PowerPoint to show you but probably have to be next time when you look at when we talk about our future home uh I think you have to understand stand it this way when God created this Earth Heaven and Earth were one okay this was this was the place where God was going to be with men right sin came in and it brought a separation now Heaven and Earth are separated Earth is merely a shadow of Heaven Earth is a shadow of the things that are Eternal and there's a separation now between that you see brother bam says you see a tree dying it means there's a tree that's not struggling for life you see a man dying it means there's a body a man not struggling for Life see so if you're talking about trees and Men we can take that further into everything here because we know even the Tabernacle the temple was merely a copy of what Moses saw in heaven and so we we can go you can go further and further and expand that understanding to realize that this is merely a shadow of reality you see a mountain that's crumbling it's uh earthquakes and so forth there's a mountain that's not doing that we can go on and on you see a polluted lake you see a polluted ocean there's an ocean that's not polluted there's we can go on and on and you understand what I'm trying to the point I'm trying to make is that we think of Heaven as a stale place it's it's just this white place and there's like a fog across the floor and there's a fog on the ceiling and you're just sort of in this like unreal place it's not that that's a lie from Satan to make you think it's boring the same thing as goes speaks about hell you think oh well H people in the world hell is a party so that's where I want to go no hell's no party you're alone you're it's the you're you're so alone that you and you'll it'll never be resolved and it'll never be fixed until you're out of existence and it's a burning place of Torment there's no parties going going on I don't think there's any communication going on unless it's between the devil and and his minions see we have to understand that so when the fall took place God created a temporary holding place for man and two sections of it one was hell one is Paradise at one point in time this was in the heart of the Earth we read about that and that there's a great Gulf fixed and no one can pass in between in Luke 16 it speaks of this and we're going to read that so then that's only temporary because God's permanent purpose is Heaven and Earth are one here and there's no hell no such thing as hell God never created hell for to be a permanent thing he created for the devil and his angels so then we have that and I believe hell is temporary and I believe the current Heaven is temporary only in the sense of its separation from Earth see that heaven it's it's Eternal the separation is temporary see heaven will be and Earth will be United together again at the end of the Millennium you don't you won't have any separation you won't in at the in in the Eternal time in the New Jerusalem it says the Tabernacle of God is with men see not the Tabernacle of men is with God but God is dwelling on Earth again with men and women his sons and daughters that he created amen so then we have the intermediate we read about this in Luke 16 uh 22 and it came to pass that the beggar died and was carried by the Angels into Abraham's bosom the rich man also died and was buried and in hell he lift up his eyes being in torments and seeth Abraham a far off and Lazarus in his bosom and he cried and said Father Abraham have mercy on me and send Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue for I'm tormented in this flame but Abraham said Son remember that thou in thy lifetime receiveth thy good things and likewise Lazarus evil things but now he has comforted Thou Art tormented and beside all this between us and you there is a great Gulf fixed so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot neither can they pass to us that would come from then then he said I pray thee therefore father that thou would Ascend him to my father's house for I have five Brethren that he may testify unto them lest they also come into this place of Torment Abraham saith unto him they have Moses and the prophets let them hear them and he said nay Father Abraham but if one went unto them from the dead they will repent and he said unto them if they hear not Moses and the prophets neither will they be persuaded though one rose from the dead so here we see upon the de upon death Lazarus is carried to Paradise By Angels amen I want to be carried by angels to Paradise amen the rich man was in torment he was thirsty he cried across the gulf to Abraham and Lazarus how that works and how that we don't know but somehow that's that that was either allowed temporarily or that could could happen under the old Covenant it can't happen anymore because Paradise in the heart of the earth is emptied out it's a different location we don't know exactly they keep their distinct identities that they had while on Earth Lazarus was still Lazarus and referred to as the beggar the rich man was referred to the rich man even though their positions were reversed Lazarus was now the rich man he was but he was still the beggar the rich man was no longer the rich man he was the beggar see they flipped positions and yet they're still known by what their experience was on Earth and who they were on Earth he asked for mercy so here somebody in hell is praying many there's many of people they never prayed their whole life and now they're in Hell praying every day deliver me deliver my family get me out of here they still had a feeling for their family so if someone in hell has a Feeling for his family what about the people in heaven amen still have a feeling for their family still have a feeling for what's happening on Earth Revelation 6 9- 11 and when he had opened the fifth seal i s saw under the altar Souls of them that were slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held and they cried with a loud voice saying how long oh Lord holy and true Dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the Earth and white robes were given unto every one of them and it was said unto them that they should rest yet for a little season until their fellow servants also and their Brethren that they should be killed as they were should be fulfilled so we look at this and we see here that the people under the fifth seal we understand these are Jews that were uh persecuted and martyred and they were under the Altar and brother bham shows us that this is Jews because if it was Christians they would say father forgive them for they know not what they do these ones are crying for vengeance so these are people in a theophany okay let's understand it let's get the big picture they're in a theophany and they're there as Jewish people in a place called under the altar all right and they pray they ask God a request that's prayer so they say h so number one is in heaven and even in the Eternal age there's still time okay so that doesn't mean that time ends it means there's still the process of time because when God made in the beginning he made the sun he made the moon he made stars and he said it before the fall said it was for times and for seasons and for signs okay and so here they are in a theophany in a body that'll never die and they're looking at what's happening on Earth and they say boy the Judgment of these people hasn't come yet they're still persecuting us they're still trying to kill our people and God hasn't brought vengeance upon those people yet so they see that and they say God when will you bring Vengeance on them see so they're looking at it in the terms of time now perspective changes completely when when you're in a body that will never die even though you're still affected by and seeing time and still these people F these people's Focus though they are in under the altar in heaven their focus is what God is doing on the earth still that's the place where God is revealed that's the place where God is working and moving and that's the primary place where the focus of Heaven is all right so they're seeing and saying we're looking at the Plan of Redemption and we're seeing that this part hasn't been fulfilled when will you do that look at God's answer rest a little while so even there he answers them with a answer that contains time rest for a little season until what until the other Jews are killed and and martyred for their faith amen we see this H we saw this happen again now Jews killed because they're Jews they 00 horrible but they still have to rest all of them now they're resting together that those that are believers those that really had a testimony and holding to the word of God I I I believe God Honors that because he blinded them we see also the story of uh Samuel and Saul Saul is going goes to the lady that's that's a witch the Witch of Endor Saul can't get an answer from God about what to do so he goes to a witch and uh there she calls up the dead and you know you can go this this is always creates questions with people but I think as message Believers we have what brother brandham taught us about this we understand that that this that Samuel came up and Samuel prophesied see whether this was an exception to the rule or what I think usually a witch is not dealing with dead humans I think the witch is usually dealing with demon spirits but under this circumstance God was going to turn things around and she's terrified because a prophet of God robed in white comes up and begins to prophesy and so we we see that Samuel is still a prophet though he's in Paradise he's still a prophet Revelation 19 uh verses 1-4 we see the Saints in heaven rejoicing over over the Judgment of Babylon and the great the great on Earth that's their focus seeing what's happened there Elijah and Moses come and meet with Jesus on Mount TR Transfiguration they're still prophets they're aware of the prophetic timetables they're coming and they're speaking with Jesus and saying your departure will be accomplished shortly and there and Jesus is discussing this with them they're still prophets Hebrews 12:1 wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin would just so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us so it's showing us that the saints that have gone before us are a cloud of witnesses this very this is fascinating to me because the picture that's being painted is the the the Roman or the Greek games it's speaking of how they would run that race in the uh my brain is not putting together but the not the Coliseum but the other place that they had um where they had the races hip uh the Hippodrome and things like that so they the Witnesses are like the spectators the fans in the stands think about a football game we'll we'll think about it in some in terms that we understand you know run this race so there's a there's a race and there's Spectators that are cheering you on so Paul is using this picture there's people watching you there's Saints in heaven watching what you're doing as a cloud of as as a as a a a a group of fans cheering you on and he's using that as a statement to encourage you to obedience to encourage you to put to death the flesh to encourage you to lay aside sin sinful things that have been hanging on to you so that you can run the race with patience that's set before you amen so you're not when someone when your family goes to to to heaven we think they're cut off from us we don't know anything about them they don't know anything about us the first part is right we don't know only by the word do we know about them right and that's more sure than anything but that we we we we're not to communicate with them we don't pray to them right the scripture forbids that we only pray to the father in the name of Jesus Christ however the other part that usually is put forward is they don't know anything about that's going on Earth otherwise it would cease to be heaven but we see that's not so from scripture scripture doesn't declare that to us that they don't know anything about that's going here what happens is the perspective is toally different when you're in a body that can't be killed you're going to think about things quite differently when you're in a body that doesn't have a sinful nature you will think about things quite differently so seeing what happens on Earth as a as a Christian without any sin on you you're not going to say oh man it's you're going to have God's perspective you're going to have God's heart you're going to have God's mind and so when you see the things transpiring on earth you're going to think of it in the realm of the prophetic timetables and when are we going back we're ready when are we picking up our bodies again that's what you're thinking when is God going to fulfill his you know the Jewish people think when is he going to fulfill his vengeance upon these people that have persecuted us for Millennia if you're the bride you're saying when are we going to get on our horses and ride back and take this thing over amen see it's a to totally different perspective you know my my my dad asked me right after my mom passed away I was staying with him at his house does Mom know how sorry and sad we are right now I said well Dad I believe she does I believe she does and she sees what we're going through but she's awful busy greeting her family and so many different people there and her perspective about it is very different now she know she she knows she sees and she has a heart for us but she see she also sees it won't be long till we're reunited won't be long till we're back together it's just a little while in in a perspective in our perspective man the days are long and the years years fly might fly by but the days are awful long and there's a whole lot of difficulties trials suffering sorrow between now and then but from the perspective of Eternity we'll say what in the world was I worried about what in the world was I so upset about what in the world did I think oh it's just never going to happen again why was I thinking like that why was I thinking I wouldn't see my mom again my my dad again my this why was I thinking
