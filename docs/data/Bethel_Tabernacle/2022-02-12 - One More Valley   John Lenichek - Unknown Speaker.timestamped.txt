[0:00] [Music]
[0:13] when i'm tossed on life's sea
[0:18] and the waves they cover me
[0:23] and the dark clouds
[0:25] they won't let the sun shine through
[0:31] [Music]
[0:33] then a voice seems to say
[0:38] child there'll be
[0:40] a brighter day
[0:43] don't allow the storm
[0:46] to hide sweet heaven's view
[0:52] cause you've got
[0:55] one more
[0:57] one more here
[1:02] and you've got
[1:04] one more trial
[1:07] one more time
[1:12] one more curve in life's row
[1:17] only one more left to go
[1:21] you can lay down your heavy load when
[1:26] you get home
[1:29] [Music]
[1:34] [Applause]
[1:36] [Music]
[1:40] don't let satan see your tears
[1:45] learn to smile through your fears
[1:50] hold your head up high
[1:52] and give the world a smile
[1:59] just be faithful all the way
[2:03] it will be worth it all someday
[2:08] before it all
[2:10] will be over after a while
[2:16] cause you've gotta watch
[2:31] one more tear
[2:49] when you get home
[2:53] oh
[2:54] you can lay down your heavy load when
[2:58] you get home
[3:03] [Music]
[3:14] [Applause]
