========================================

um good morning everyone good morning let's pray heavenly father we just come together studying your word lord and worship and preaching of the word to you we ask that your holy spirit will be in complete control of every heart every mind lord that you would be glorified priesthood of all believers this is part two and um just continuing on from the last time if you look at all the orthodox churches in the world they always have an order of priests so you look at the eastern orthodox oriental orthodox and the roman catholic they all have priests who they've ordained to perform the sacraments for the laity right so this is this is a going way back in history that they've started this and we you know you can read in the church ages book and and we'll do a little bit of that today where you see that development where it started out with elders in a local church who were overseeing the word overseer in greek is the same word that we've transliterated to bishop it's like it's much it's much like the word uh baptism baptism has no meaning in the english language it's transliterated from the greek baptizo so it's directly from the greek and they've just created a new word essentially for it but if they were to literally translate the word baptism it would mean immersion we be immersed in the name of the lord jesus christ and then and for the word bishop you look at that word episcopal is the word bishop this comes from coming from the latin much not that we need a latin and historic history of the language words but rapture rapture is not it's always accused it's not in the bible right it's the word it's from the latin word rapturo which is translated from the greek word catching away harpazo harpazo to latin rapturo to english rapture so it just means catching away this word bishop is coming from episcopal that simply means overseer or to visit is another another word that that speaks of it to oversee by visitation so they took these words elder presbyter and episcopals they separated these two offices in the time of the early church and they made a bishop over many many local churches and then as time went on they changed changed the meaning instead of being a pastor they changed it from being a pastor to a priest now there's a hierarchy of priests and that's where we find this understanding in eastern orthodox all the all the orthodox churches roman catholic whatever it might be i think anglican also has that viewpoint where they call them priests and so we understand the jewish jewish faith had priests they had when they had a sacrificial system in operation in israel that was up until 70 a.d when titus attacked and destroyed the temple since that time they have not had an operational priesthood they have rabbis and it doesn't matter what tribe or what clan they come from they're simply teachers of the law but the sacrificial system does not exist in judaism anymore therefore they have no priesthood now they're looking forward to a time when it will be restored but since 7080 it has not existed anywhere on earth in islam they have no they actually have no priesthood at all but if you look at other pagan religions through history they always relied on animal sacrifices and as such they always had a priesthood and the priest the intention of the priesthood is to be a mediator a special class of people that were separated for the purpose of mediating between the people and whatever deity that they were serving so basically they're mediators between god the gods and mankind so in the christian faith we understand the little levitical priesthood has been set aside and a new priest arises after a different order hebrews 7 verses 11 and 12. if therefore perfection were by the levitical priesthood for under it the people received the law what further need was there that another priest should should rise after the order of melchizedek and not be called after the order of aaron for the priesthood being changed there is made of necessity a change also of the law and verse 18 for there is verily a disallowing of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness there of it's a very strange and interesting way to speak about laws instituted by god the referring to laws or commandments which were weak and unprofitable now this can't be speaking of the moral law the moral law is actually an expression it's eternal and it's expression of the very nature of god himself the moral law is never done away with we're not of those christians who say there's no moral law governing god's people there is it's just how that's applied has changed now under the new covenant so the moral law ten commandments is not passing away what is being disannulled disannulled means literally means cancelled so what is being cancelled the sacrificial law that's the very thing that paul is speaking about in hebrews in chapter seven eight and nine read it on your own time there's a new covenant he promises a new covenant paul is saying he promised under the old covenant a new covenant why did he do that he promised in the psalms that there would be a priest come after the order of melchizedek if the first priesthood was perfect and could make the worshipers perfect why did god have to promise a new covenant and a new priesthood so if there's a new one coming it means there's a change and there's a cancellation these things are simple basic for us but for the jewish understanding it's it's a it's a radical revelation that was a complete mystery they didn't they didn't understand these things this way whatsoever and paul comes along and says don't you see there's a promise of a new priesthood don't you see there's a promise of a new covenant that means this one isn't the perfect one you say but god instituted it god instituted it to show us what not to show that he's imperfect to show you and i that we are imperfect that we can accomplish it but not only that to show that the system of animal sacrifices cannot truly forgive sins the blood and bull of bulls and goats only covered sins and pushed them forward why every year they had to do it over and over and over again next the next year comes the feast of atonement maybe there's a new high priest that priest has to first offer us sacrifice for himself and then for the people that's a continual process that is by nature imperfect a perfect sacrifice had to come that could be offered once for all christ offered his blood he becomes the priest after the order of melchizedek not after the order of aaron but after the order of melchizedek there's a new priestly order that comes place now first timothy 2 5 there isn't multiple multiple sacrifices for sins right there isn't a priestly order that's making sacrifices continually to cover sins first timothy 2 verse 5 says for there is one god and one mediator between god and men the man christ jesus there's no other mediators a prophet is not a mediator why am i saying that a messenger from god is not a mediator he is a channel for the holy spirit to communicate through but a prophet a messenger an apostle paul was not making a sacrifice for sin paul was not offering himself as a sacrifice for sin in in catholicism they have the mass every time they do the mass they say it's the sacrifice of the mass and they're sacrificing every time over and over again in their minds the son of god that's a sacrifice and the people eat it and they receive forgiveness of sins by taking this sacrifice upon themselves it's completely false he was off his body was offered once for all his blood was shed once he went up to god he offered that blood once and god says it's done the sin questions answered the now the worshipers that come to god can be perfect they their their conscience can be totally cleansed under the law what was it every year we're making a sacrifice for your sins that you didn't realize that you committed that you didn't confess that you forgot about that's what the atonement was for was for sins that were done in ignorance the the feast of atonement sins that were committed in ignorance and they did it every year again and again now that's not necessary that's fulfilled in christ all of our sins are obliterated by that blood now once that blood is offered that in a new covenant comes forth now we have a new covenant no sacrifice is needed no other means of washing away our sins is needed it's all by that blood that's why on the cross when he was dying he said it is finished tetelestai that's what he said in greek tetelestai is stamped on documents when the full price was paid for something they stamped tetelestai it is finished the price has been paid there's no more sacrifices for sinned the work has been completed now exodus 19 5-6 i kind of skipped ahead from here but i want to cover this this is god's promise to the nation of israel look what he says now therefore if i want to highlight that word if if you will obey my voice indeed and keep my covenant then shall you be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people for all the earth is mine and you shall be unto me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation these are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of israel if you will obey did they they did not obey so his promise of being kings and priests to israel was conditional on their keeping of the covenant the entire historical books in the old testament are detailing they did not do that read the end of deuteronomy what is the psalm what is the song that moses sings it's quite a dark song it's not happy it's not a rejoicing song the song is you will not keep the covenant that's what he sings over them you will not keep the covenant you will disobey the covenant and god will bring all these curses upon you that he's promised he'll send you in out of this land so even their living in the land of israel was conditional on their obedience if they disobey i'll cast you out if you disobey you're not kings and priests and their ultimate disobedience was what rejecting the messiah they rejected and turned against the messiah of course this is all in god's plan god god preordained this to happen that way he wasn't taken off guard but they rejected the messiah and then god said okay you're done the temple is destroyed your word your form of worship is altered until until i restore it until i restore you but the promise conditional upon us what happens when promises of god are conditional upon us over and over and over again what if what if all conditions are perfect around us the garden of eden what if everything is perfect how will we keep the covenant no no it's not going to happen we cannot keep the covenant the story of the bible is that you can't do it you cannot do it on your own you're totally incapable and so he says i will make a new covenant i will write my laws in your heart and in your mind i will put my spirit to live inside of you and to keep my own laws and i will shed blood so that your sins are completely obliterated so that you stand in my sight as though you're perfect when god does it it's done when you and i do it it's a it all our righteousness is as filthy rags so let's look at revelation 1 5 and 6. and from jesus christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood and hath made us kings and priests unto god and his father to him be glory and dominion forever and ever amen did you catch that he made us by his blood he made us kings and priests to israel he said if you obey you'll be kings and priests here he says you know what you can't i showed you for thousands of years you can't now i will make you kings and priests think about the grace of god to us gentiles we were not the chosen people god was not even dealing with gentiles for thousands of years and what happened what happens the jews reject him he turns to the gentiles and said i have made you kings and priests by the blood of jesus christ now it's a grace covenant to make us kings and priests revelations 5 9-10 and they sung a new song saying thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou a slain and has redeemed us to god by thy blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation that were redeemed as purchased he paid the purchase price he didn't at that time he hadn't yet claimed his purchase in in in the world of that day just like marriage there's two parts to every purchase when you make a purchase you first pay the price in in in marriage in at this point in time in history in the jewish nation first they had the betrothal that was where you paid a price so the father of the groom paid the father of the bride a certain amount that they negotiated that was the purchase price then when he was when the the wedding was to take place then he would receive what he had paid for so christ at calvary paid the price right now he comes in spirit form in our day to receive his bride to himself to and to enter into an invisible union spiritual union with his bride but it's by that purchase price now we enter into a new relationship and he you have through that blood through that purchase you've made us unto our god kings and priests and we shall reign on the earth amen we are now in the relationship in the position of kings and priests and in the future in the millennium we will reign on the earth revelation 20 verse 6. blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection on such the second death hath no power but they shall be priests of god and of christ and shall reign with him a thousand years so under all religions in history there was a special class of people called priests they were the mediators between the deity and the people but now under the new this new covenant that's made in the blood of christ every single believer is a priest think about that every single believer is a priest first peter 2 5 ye also as lively stones are built up a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to god by jesus christ who was peter writing to was he writing to preachers only absolutely zero evidence of that he was writing to saints he was writing to believers every believer and then verse nine but you are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation a peculiar people that you should show forth the praises of him who has called you out of darkness into his marvelous light so every believer is a priest this has to this completely does away with catholic catholicism and all the orthodox faiths that separate the priesthood into a different class of people that's completely done away with okay so we're priests priests we're always doing what under the old covenant offering sacrifices right do we offer sacrifices we covered that pretty clearly there is no more sacrifice for sin the work is completed a perfect sinless sacrifice was offered and now we have a new high priest after the order of melchizedek and he stands as the only mediator between god and men we are not mediators between god and men because we didn't offer a sacrifice and we are not that high priest but let's look at it this way under the old covenant not every sacrifice that was given had to do with sin so if you look at this there were five different types of sacrifices i'm not going to go into detail on this there was the burnt offering obviously has to do with sin there was the grain or meal offering it actually has nothing to do with sin there's the sin offering obviously has to do with sin there's the guilt offering again has to do with sin and there's a peace offering it doesn't directly have to do with sin but it has to do with restoring fellowship between god and men therefore it's definitely connected to the sacrifice of jesus christ so there's four different sacrifices that we can definitely tie to being fulfilled by jesus christ but there's one which is the grain or the meal offering this grain offering was a dedication it was a dedication it was basically saying thank you god for what you've done for me so what do we do in our priesthood let's look at this and again this is all about worship what is priesthood it's all about worship what is the gospel all about ultimately it's all about worship the great commission was to go out and create worship for god where there wasn't worship for the true and living god so when we are acting as priests what is it it's worship so again we read these already but you are a spirit first peter two verse five you're built up a spiritual house holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to god by jesus christ our spiritual sacrifices are only acceptable to god by jesus christ now because of the blood of jesus christ we can now have direct access to god because of the blood that he shed the veil was rent and we can walk in to the very presence of god where only the high priest could go once per year now we're all if we don't go in it's death before if we did go in it would be death now if we don't enter inside the veil it's death but we can only do that by jesus christ we can't do that on our own efforts then verse nine we're a whole a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation a pupil your people why that you should show forth the praises of him who has called you hebrews 13 15 why are we supposed let me back up why are we supposed to show forth the praises of him who has called you out of darkness because he's our object of worship beyond that so that others would hear and see what god has done for you and they could enter into the same called us out of darkness into his marvelous light what is that talking about salvation redemption so why are we praising him for his redemption for his salvation because he's worthy of it and because he wants others to enter in and experience that same thing hebrews 13 15 by him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to god continually that is the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name again it's not just lifting our hands in a worship service right this is the this is going right down to the nitty-gritty of you how you speak what is your confession what do you talk about on a daily basis are your lips giving thanks to his name or is it talking about how dark and how bad and how terrible it is or are you talking about how great god is in the midst of all this um my goodness i guess there's probably gonna be a part three here um let me read this quote and then we'll close with that it's from faith is the substance in 1951 the love of god is like a notary public takes a seal and presses it until the inscription of that seal is pressed in the paper over the signature oh my and when christ signs your name on the book of life and the holy spirit presses it in there until the life of christ is formed in you hallelujah becomes deity men and women are sons and daughters of god it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know we shall be we'll be like him for we will see him as he is have a body like his own glorious body and we're waiting for our perfect redemption amen you believe it our bodies are growing and we have an inheritance and we're children now heirs of the kingdom kings and priests unto god offering spiritual sacrifices what does a priest do make a sacrifice what is a spiritual sacrifice that's what these sons and daughters do which are kings and priests yet not in full position but they're making sacrifices offering to god spiritual sacrifices the fruit of our lips giving praise to his name fruits of our lips you say brother branham i just don't feel like praising him that's the time to make the sacrifice praise him anyhow kings and priests sons and daughters offering spiritual sacrifice the fruit of our lips giving praise unto his name let's stand heavenly father we just come to you lord and we ask that you would bring the quickening of the word into our hearts draw us closer to you lord move in a mighty way in the service father through the worship and through the the preaching of the word may you be glorified in all of it father we ask it in jesus name amen god bless you
