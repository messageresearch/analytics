[44:03] so uh so you know the uh the testimonies
[44:06] that sister Gene has been doing and uh
[44:08] by the way we've I've gotten so many
[44:10] requests from around the world I don't
[44:12] think sister Gene knew how far and wide
[44:15] her testimonies have gone and Everywhere
[44:17] I Go people are asking me and emailing
[44:19] me and when is Sister Gene going to get
[44:21] to do part three when is she going to do
[44:22] part three amen so she's uh working on
[44:26] that and brother Jack has one that he's
[44:27] wanting to do and I want him to do it it
[44:30] is it is power packed amen of course it
[44:34] doesn't have to be that power it could
[44:35] be a common story but hearing brother
[44:37] Jack tell it amen it'll be power packed
[44:41] but trust me this one is this one is
[44:43] power packed with God moving and so we
[44:47] wanted to do it today at four o'clock
[44:48] but me in all of my travel and hustle
[44:51] and bustling I didn't let you know about
[44:54] it so I said to brother Jack I can let
[44:56] the church know today and we can do it
[44:58] at four and I think he has friends here
[45:00] who are who are here to actually hear it
[45:02] today but we might take advantage of
[45:05] that and make them come back next week
[45:07] and and that way I can announce it from
[45:09] the pulpit and I love to have all the
[45:11] senior youth group there and say why
[45:14] brother Jason why does he use because I
[45:16] want you to know that he lives
[45:18] that Christ is powerful and this is not
[45:21] a myth it's not a story this is not just
[45:24] some movement this is the Living God
[45:26] Among Us today that this is a
[45:28] restoration that's what the restoration
[45:30] brings it brings back the book of Acts
[45:33] so we're this isn't this is more than
[45:35] just some doctrinal movement that we're

[46:17] holy spirit is like whack-a-mold is
[46:19] waxing every time he pops his head a bow
[46:22] and he's uh you'd think the devil would

[50:27] amen amen thank you sister Deborah God
[50:30] bless you we're going to invite you to
[50:32] the book of Acts this morning chapter 7.
[50:36] happy to have you here in the camp of
[50:38] the king amen
[50:41] praise the Lord
[50:47] amen amen I was
[50:50] up early this morning earlier than
[50:52] normal actually the last two mornings
[50:55] up a little earlier than normal
[50:58] and
[51:00] just looking to the Lord and the Lord
[51:03] seemed to move on me last several days
[51:05] in an in a rather unusual way and I
[51:10] found out why this morning I want to
[51:12] take a title
[51:14] if this was Resurrection morning
[51:18] amen I was astonished to hear Brother
[51:21] Brad and I don't know if him seeing my
[51:23] title put the seed in his heart or or
[51:26] the Holy Spirit anointing him to
[51:27] encourage me but one of the last lines
[51:30] of his Sunday school was I want this to
[51:32] be Resurrection morning
[51:34] oh my come back in my office and I said
[51:36] get out of my office get I don't want to
[51:38] talk to you go away get away you don't
[51:40] even we're not even going to take a
[51:42] chance here leave bye
[51:44] hahaha
[51:46] amen so that's the way the anointing
[51:48] works when it hits a preacher you have
[51:50] to be careful amen because it's just
[51:52] it's all one channel and a preacher with
[51:53] a gift will step in it and and Away you
[51:55] go and send you back to the drawing
[51:57] board amen
[51:58] so praise the Lord sometimes I wonder if
[52:00] I need to put a trap door here so that I
[52:03] can push a button and just disappear I
[52:05] preacher if he starts getting into my
[52:06] territory praise the Lord amen amen amen
[52:11] move the move the tank forward and
[52:13] baptize him again or something
[52:16] amen praise the Lord what if this
[52:18] morning
[52:19] was Resurrection morning
[52:24] my Prophet talked about between six and
[52:26] nine in the morning I was up early this
[52:28] morning thinking along those lines Acts
[52:32] chapter 7 verse 44 would catch 44
[52:35] through 56.
[52:39] Stephen in his
[52:41] um indictment
[52:44] of of his own countrymen this is his
[52:47] indictment sermon Peter had already
[52:48] preached his indictment sermon in Acts 2
[52:51] and here's Stephen uh with his our
[52:54] fathers
[52:55] had the Tabernacle of witness in the
[52:58] wilderness
[52:59] as he had appointed speaking unto Moses
[53:01] that he should make it according to the
[53:04] fashion that he had seen which also our
[53:07] fathers that came after brought in with
[53:09] Joshua into the possession of the
[53:12] Gentiles whom God drove out before the
[53:14] face of our fathers unto the days of
[53:17] David who found favor before God and
[53:19] desired to find a tabernacle for the god
[53:23] of Jacob
[53:24] Solomon built him a house now how many
[53:26] know Jesus was that house
[53:28] every Tabernacle in the wilderness they
[53:31] built was all in type of Jesus Christ
[53:34] the entire Book of Leviticus in fact is
[53:37] I have often called The Book of
[53:40] Leviticus the the gospels of the Old
[53:42] Testament because it it covers all the
[53:45] things that you read in the gospels in
[53:46] manifestation it was in type in The Book
[53:49] of Leviticus because it was the
[53:51] priesthood of Christ and so we find here
[53:54] that he says Solomon built him a house
[53:56] how be it the most high dwelleth not in
[53:59] temples made with hands as saith the
[54:01] prophet Heaven is my throne and Earth is
[54:04] my footstool what house will you build
[54:06] me saith the Lord or what is the place
[54:09] of my rest hath not my hand made all
[54:13] these things
[54:14] now watch this turn here you
[54:17] stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart
[54:19] and ears ye to always resist the Holy
[54:22] Ghost as your fathers did so do ye which
[54:26] of the prophets have not your fathers
[54:28] persecuted and they have slain them
[54:31] which showed before of the coming of the
[54:33] just one of whom you had of whom you
[54:37] have been now the betrayers and
[54:39] murderers now
[54:41] Stephen had him dead to rights they knew
[54:44] this was true no one could deny it
[54:48] see they're they're they're they're
[54:49] they're they're so offended they can't
[54:52] defend themselves so they execute the
[54:55] the man bringing them the messenger
[54:57] that's bringing them the truth
[55:00] he says verse 53 who have received the
[55:03] law by the dispensation of angels and
[55:05] have not kept it see
[55:08] when they heard these things they didn't
[55:10] repent
[55:11] when they heard these things they didn't
[55:13] own it
[55:14] sometimes you just need to own the word
[55:17] sometimes you just need to raise up your
[55:19] hands in the universal sign of surrender
[55:21] and say Amen or old me or oh my or help
[55:23] me God
[55:24] amen but whatever you do don't resist it
[55:29] your life is on the line your life is on
[55:32] the line
[55:34] and even if even if it were even if
[55:36] you're sealed into the Holy Spirit and
[55:38] your life to come is not on the line
[55:40] which it wouldn't be because Saint John
[55:42] 5 24 you've passed from Death to life
[55:44] but while you're still living here your
[55:47] life and what happens to you on this
[55:49] side is on the line don't resist the
[55:51] word of God
[55:52] just say amen and own it see
[55:56] when they heard these things they were
[55:58] cut to the heart
[55:59] and here's here's the difference between
[56:01] a Believer and an unbeliever we get cut
[56:03] to the heart
[56:05] they gnashed on him with their teeth
[56:08] so that's a big difference from raising
[56:09] your hands and saying Amen to the word
[56:12] but he being full of the Holy Ghost
[56:16] looked up and looked up steadfastly into
[56:18] heaven let me tell you something that is
[56:20] the reward of every Minister who stands
[56:22] In a Pulpit and the people are resisting
[56:25] what he's saying
[56:26] it doesn't matter he can still see the
[56:29] Holy Spirit he can still look up if the
[56:31] people turn red in the face and get mad
[56:33] he can just look up because he knows
[56:36] he's in the path of the Holy Spirit
[56:39] he looked up steadfastly into heaven and
[56:41] saw the glory of God and Jesus standing
[56:43] on the right hand of God and said behold
[56:46] I see the heavens open and the son of
[56:48] man standing on the right hand of God
[56:51] let's pray
[56:53] father we thank you for your word and
[56:55] for the preacher anointing that I feel
[56:57] now help me to be studious Lord as I go
[57:00] through I I I have a great burden on my
[57:04] heart but yet I also want to lay the
[57:06] enough Foundation Lord that it becomes
[57:09] effectual to the people I commit it to
[57:12] you to this end that you will accomplish
[57:14] it Lord I am here just as your servant
[57:17] just as your assistant I give it to you
[57:19] now in Jesus Christ's name amen God
[57:22] bless you friends you can be seated
[57:29] foreign
[57:43] if I were to
[57:46] begin I could begin if I were to begin
[57:50] with something familiar to you we would
[57:53] go to Revelation chapter 10 which is
[57:57] very familiar probably exceptionally
[57:59] familiar to members of the of the
[58:01] message of the hour we we realize what
[58:04] it means to us I hope we do and and we
[58:07] see that that that that that when
[58:10] chapter 10 when the events of chapter 10
[58:12] which are a seventh age messenger
[58:15] standing on the earth a mighty Angel
[58:17] which is Christ descending down with now
[58:19] a book that is open because he opened it
[58:22] the lamb opened it and he brings it to
[58:25] his seventh Church age messenger who
[58:27] then gives it to the people and then the
[58:29] people take the book and eat the book
[58:31] and become the book
[58:32] amen and when all of that is
[58:35] accomplished the last visible sign that
[58:37] you see and it's a visible one that it's
[58:40] not just spiritual it's not just
[58:42] spiritual the last visible sign you see
[58:45] of this bride before Moses and Elijah go
[58:49] to the Jews in 11 verse 2 in verse 1 you
[58:53] find that the the inside of the of the
[58:56] of the temple is being measured not the
[58:58] outside the outside is left to the
[59:01] Gentiles they're going into a
[59:02] tribulation the foolish virgin they're
[59:04] going to miss it they'll be saved in
[59:06] them in in the and brought into the new
[59:08] heavens and the new Earth and they'll
[59:10] Rest in paradise while we are back here
[59:12] on Earth in a millennial Reign for a
[59:14] thousand years but we find that the
[59:17] Bride As She the last visible sign of
[59:20] her before you see Moses and Elijah in
[59:24] the gospel going to the Jews is the
[59:26] bride is now the the measurable
[59:29] Perfection of the Lord Jesus Christ she
[59:32] is the temple she's being measured she's
[59:35] now the word she's become like him it's
[59:37] now Mr and Mrs Jesus Christ to the world
[59:40] and that's the last sign you see we
[59:44] don't get trapped up by chapters and
[59:46] verses because those were added hundreds
[59:48] of years later by translators when John
[59:50] wrote it it was just continuous it went
[59:53] from Revelation 10 11 all and it just
[59:56] moved into the to the wording of rev of
[59:58] Revelation 11 1 and we see that
[1:00:01] connection there that the inside of the
[1:00:03] of the temple was measured because the
[1:00:05] bride is the measurable standard let the
[1:00:08] world
[1:00:10] say what they want she's the measurable
[1:00:12] standard
[1:00:14] the word it didn't matter what people
[1:00:16] thought of Paul's teaching it was the
[1:00:19] Gospel that God would judge the World by
[1:00:21] because now that now since the gospel
[1:00:25] since the world is only going to be
[1:00:28] judged by Jesus Christ and can only be
[1:00:30] judged by Jesus Christ then that then
[1:00:33] that proves that Paul's teaching and
[1:00:37] Jesus Christ was Jesus Christ in the
[1:00:40] form of the word you follow me because
[1:00:42] Paul said that it can't be changed it
[1:00:45] can't be countermanded I've laid a
[1:00:47] foundation whoever Builds on here has to
[1:00:50] build it according to the way the
[1:00:51] foundation you can't build contrary to
[1:00:53] it and so if even an angel or any other
[1:00:56] preacher if even if I myself come back
[1:00:58] so it wasn't the man
[1:01:01] if even I myself come back and teach any
[1:01:04] other thing if it's anybody else if it's
[1:01:06] an angel let them be cursed because what
[1:01:09] I say God will judge the World by Jesus
[1:01:13] Christ but and so what he said was the
[1:01:16] word and that was Christ in word form
[1:01:19] see so so we find then that today when
[1:01:23] we make a statement that this is the
[1:01:26] gospel this message of the hour is the
[1:01:29] gospel by which the Lord by which you
[1:01:31] will make a Rapture or you want we're
[1:01:34] only we're only saying that because this
[1:01:37] message is the restoration of Paul's
[1:01:39] teaching amen
[1:01:41] so quite naturally we would say that
[1:01:44] quite naturally we would believe that
[1:01:46] that if if it's going to have to be what
[1:01:49] Paul established and and that gets lost
[1:01:52] down through the church ages and we can
[1:01:54] see that historically and then it gets
[1:01:56] restored at the end time according to
[1:01:57] prophecy and it happens exactly like he
[1:02:00] said then why would I not put my faith
[1:02:03] that this that this message is giving me
[1:02:05] rapturing Faith
[1:02:11] and rapturing Faith as beautiful as it
[1:02:14] is and as necessary as it is
[1:02:16] I'm so glad that it is preceded by
[1:02:19] Rapture and Grace
[1:02:21] I want you to know it's not just Grace
[1:02:23] it's not just the favor of God it's
[1:02:25] rapturing Grace
[1:02:27] it's a Grace that the grace of God I'm
[1:02:30] going to say a little bit more about it
[1:02:31] you you could never say too much about
[1:02:33] the grace of God that came to us by that
[1:02:37] day on Calvary
[1:02:40] so we find that when we talk about the
[1:02:43] measurable standard what is it what is
[1:02:45] it what's being measured the temple
[1:02:48] and that and that's what Solomon was
[1:02:50] building and that's what Jesus was and
[1:02:52] therefore whatever he was his bride
[1:02:54] would be you see and so because they are
[1:02:57] one they become one flesh and she's
[1:02:59] she's life of his life word of his word
[1:03:02] amen and so so it's based on that that
[1:03:05] brother Brandon would say she is him not
[1:03:08] meaning she's literally him because we
[1:03:09] don't we don't baptize in each other's
[1:03:11] names and you don't I don't pray to you
[1:03:13] and you can't save me
[1:03:15] but Hebrews 13 8 is the key to unlock
[1:03:17] the how is she him she's the same as him
[1:03:20] because in whatever form Jesus Christ
[1:03:22] came whether it was Jesus creating the
[1:03:24] heavens and the Earth as the Bible said
[1:03:26] he did or whether it was walking in the
[1:03:28] prophets of the Old Testament that was
[1:03:30] Jesus or whether it was or whether it
[1:03:33] was Jesus living in a in a body that
[1:03:35] walked the shores of Galilee or whether
[1:03:37] it when he went away and came back and
[1:03:39] he said I go away but I'll come again I
[1:03:41] will come again and I'll live inside you
[1:03:43] that and so now his church his body is
[1:03:47] quite naturally misses Jesus Christ the
[1:03:50] same as he's always been
[1:03:53] that's how you identify the word for
[1:03:56] your hour
[1:03:58] when it produces and if this message
[1:04:00] didn't produce it I'd be looking for
[1:04:02] another one
[1:04:03] when it produces the same life that you
[1:04:06] see in the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:04:09] when you see the same life It produced
[1:04:12] in Abraham that same faith when you see
[1:04:15] the same kind of commitment It produced
[1:04:17] in Joseph when you see the same kind of
[1:04:19] Courage It produced in Gideon when you
[1:04:21] see the same kind of the same kind of uh
[1:04:24] uh commitment and courage and faith that
[1:04:27] It produced in Moses
[1:04:31] and Moses said here's how you'll know
[1:04:33] the Lord God will raise up a prophet
[1:04:35] among you
[1:04:36] and he'll be a human
[1:04:38] he won't be some mystical being coming
[1:04:40] down it'll be God coming to you in human
[1:04:43] form
[1:04:44] see and so if you ever wanted to know
[1:04:47] how would God live or what would he be
[1:04:49] like if he were a human like me just
[1:04:51] read your Bible and read the story of
[1:04:53] Jesus
[1:04:54] you'd read about God being in Christ see
[1:04:58] and so so it's all about
[1:05:02] it's all it all comes down to being
[1:05:06] willing
[1:05:07] because
[1:05:08] this is what the message of restoration
[1:05:12] that was promised in this hour this is
[1:05:15] what it calls you to
[1:05:18] it it doesn't first of all let me let me
[1:05:21] clarify what it does by telling you what
[1:05:23] it's not come for it's not come to make
[1:05:26] us another denomination
[1:05:29] it's not come to make another organized
[1:05:31] religion we got 30 33 000 of them not
[1:05:34] interested in getting at the end of that
[1:05:36] line and forming another one
[1:05:38] amen
[1:05:40] so it's it's not come to give you better
[1:05:42] theology although it accomplishes that
[1:05:45] to give you better understanding
[1:05:47] theologically
[1:05:48] but what it comes for is to
[1:05:52] to make you the living Tabernacle of a
[1:05:56] living God's presence
[1:06:01] brother Donald that's why come
[1:06:03] that's why it come you understand it
[1:06:07] came to make us the living Tabernacle
[1:06:10] Peter said your Lively Stones built up
[1:06:13] see we could we could look at so many
[1:06:16] scriptures I'm gonna I'm gonna try to
[1:06:18] cut down today on on too much reading
[1:06:20] but we could easily go to Hebrews 12 and
[1:06:23] I'm thinking I should and then I think I
[1:06:24] shouldn't but but but but but but Paul
[1:06:27] let me just make a reference without
[1:06:28] putting it on the screen
[1:06:30] um no good to see you in the booth today
[1:06:31] Noah and so
[1:06:34] Paul speaks about that in the second
[1:06:36] chapter of Ephesians
[1:06:38] how that that we're built on the
[1:06:40] foundation of the Apostles and Prophets
[1:06:42] and Christ is the Chief Cornerstone in
[1:06:44] whom all the building fitly framed
[1:06:46] together growth unto an Holy Temple of
[1:06:48] the Lord in whom ye also
[1:06:51] are building together
[1:06:53] so what I need to convince you of why
[1:06:56] the message came I just read you why the
[1:06:58] gospel comes say well what's the message
[1:07:00] this is the restored gospel that's all
[1:07:02] it is it's not a new message it's not a
[1:07:04] different one it's just the restoration
[1:07:06] of the original
[1:07:08] that's why it turns Believers into
[1:07:11] original kind of Christians
[1:07:13] that's exactly why that happens
[1:07:17] see it's not about a list of do's and
[1:07:20] don'ts we're not even about that at all
[1:07:22] this has nothing to do with that I'm I'm
[1:07:25] faithful to Christ's word because I'm in
[1:07:27] love with him
[1:07:28] I'm faithful to to you're faithful to
[1:07:31] your spouse because you're in love with
[1:07:33] that person
[1:07:37] so he goes on we could we could we could
[1:07:39] go to Hebrews 12 and oh my so many
[1:07:42] different places in Saint Peter where he
[1:07:44] talked about it and and and and but I
[1:07:47] but I I I want to I want to just move a
[1:07:50] little bit further and try to get get a
[1:07:52] little further along
[1:07:53] so
[1:07:57] when Stephen
[1:07:59] is preaching his sermon
[1:08:03] um Noah go back to our text in Acts 7
[1:08:06] and give me verse 50 or let's get on to
[1:08:10] verse 50 again
[1:08:13] in Acts 7 and 50. now I want you to
[1:08:16] watch the line of demarcation between
[1:08:18] two verses verse 50 hath not my hands
[1:08:21] made all these things verse 51.
[1:08:24] you stiff-necked and uncircumcised and
[1:08:27] hardened ears
[1:08:29] I mean you talking about
[1:08:36] a that's a hairpin turn
[1:08:39] and so we find that that the Divide
[1:08:42] between verse 50 and 51
[1:08:46] is
[1:08:48] Christian
[1:08:49] by the hearers
[1:08:51] to disallow their lives to be the living
[1:08:56] Tabernacle
[1:08:58] his whole subject that he's preaching on
[1:09:01] that he we started out in verse 44 and
[1:09:04] he starts talking about this Tabernacle
[1:09:06] built and by the time you get down to
[1:09:09] verse 50 those people have already made
[1:09:12] the decision
[1:09:14] they're hearing a holy ghost-filled
[1:09:16] preacher
[1:09:17] and right while he's preaching you want
[1:09:19] to talk about the polar opposite of
[1:09:21] Peter in the house of Cornelius the
[1:09:24] Bible says while he yet spanked these
[1:09:26] words the Holy Ghost fell
[1:09:28] so you got a big difference between that
[1:09:30] crowd and this crowd
[1:09:32] Stephen is preaching to them about being
[1:09:34] the Tabernacle of the living God's
[1:09:35] presence and by the by the as soon as he
[1:09:38] finishes the 50th verse
[1:09:41] which is 50s Jubilee
[1:09:45] and they refuse the Jubilee and
[1:09:48] immediately the very next verse he turns
[1:09:50] and says you stiff neck you
[1:09:52] uncircumcised people you do always
[1:09:54] resist God's Jubilee
[1:09:57] you resisted it in the days of Moses you
[1:10:00] resisted it in the days of the prophets
[1:10:01] which one of them did your fathers not
[1:10:04] kill and you polish their tombs
[1:10:05] indicating you agree with what they did
[1:10:10] you show by your works that you agree
[1:10:13] with their Rebellion
[1:10:16] and they were refusing can you imagine
[1:10:20] that you're hearing the Living Word of
[1:10:22] God that's inviting you
[1:10:24] I hope you're catching this today and
[1:10:27] bringing it home
[1:10:28] because I'm preaching in the 21st
[1:10:30] century I'm preaching today
[1:10:33] see this is what the message is about
[1:10:35] this is what it came for
[1:10:38] and it's an invitation
[1:10:40] to become the living Tabernacle of the
[1:10:43] living God's dwelling place and the
[1:10:45] choice is yours
[1:10:48] and these people actually
[1:10:51] God's people Israel
[1:10:54] doctors of divinity
[1:10:56] Scholars that's brother as brother Brad
[1:10:59] was showing that in his Sunday school
[1:11:01] class today I've heard that same thing
[1:11:02] that they could take a a road scroll and
[1:11:06] run a pen through it and tell you every
[1:11:07] Hebrew letter it hit going through
[1:11:10] that's how studied they were
[1:11:12] and yet they not only rejected that
[1:11:15] scroll when it was in flesh
[1:11:18] that scroll lived in front of them and
[1:11:20] Stephen busted him on that he said he
[1:11:22] was right here you know it
[1:11:24] you know what you did and God proved it
[1:11:27] see so instead of repenting they got
[1:11:30] angry and what they're saying is and
[1:11:34] what many are saying today and I hope
[1:11:36] none of us are saying it they are saying
[1:11:40] I will not allow myself to be the living
[1:11:46] Temple of the living God's presence
[1:11:53] which is exactly
[1:11:55] what the message
[1:11:57] calls for today
[1:12:03] I said to the audience in Washington
[1:12:05] where I was just preaching what to God
[1:12:07] you could hear
[1:12:08] Stephen's voice crying out today
[1:12:11] what to God I could press play today and
[1:12:14] hear the voice of Stephen but I have an
[1:12:16] advantage that I can pick up this Bible
[1:12:18] and you can hear the same voice that was
[1:12:21] speaking through Stephen speaking to you
[1:12:23] what a privileged friend their way that
[1:12:26] way you're still not resting your
[1:12:28] Eternal destination on a man you're
[1:12:30] resting it on that's not a it's not a
[1:12:32] it's not a man it's the body word or the
[1:12:34] son of man
[1:12:36] what a privilege we have today to know
[1:12:39] that the same Christ who spoke to and
[1:12:42] through Stephen can speak to and through
[1:12:45] you and me
[1:12:47] and we can make the decision today to
[1:12:50] say I'll get in line I'm not going to
[1:12:52] get in line to be an organized religion
[1:12:54] but I'll get in line and fight to get to
[1:12:56] the head of the line if it means I can
[1:12:58] be the living Tabernacle of the living
[1:13:01] God's presence
[1:13:06] oh my
[1:13:11] because I
[1:13:12] I want to hear that voice that says come
[1:13:14] up
[1:13:16] my brother Jack Duff says you'll never
[1:13:18] hear come up if you don't first hear
[1:13:19] come out
[1:13:21] on that morning of our crossing over
[1:13:23] friends and I just thought what if this
[1:13:25] is that morning
[1:13:26] oh this might be that morning when we'll
[1:13:28] all cross over together oh my are the
[1:13:33] heavens open to you today like they were
[1:13:35] to Stephen can you can you stand in this
[1:13:38] Christ's rejecting world and see the
[1:13:40] same Jesus that he saw he saw him
[1:13:43] standing on the right hand of God's
[1:13:45] power can you see God's living power
[1:13:48] moving inside your life
[1:13:52] I asked them there and I'll ask you here
[1:13:55] here's a further question would you like
[1:13:56] to
[1:14:01] where is your heart today
[1:14:03] who or what
[1:14:07] holds your affections
[1:14:10] today
[1:14:13] I had never
[1:14:15] preached a sermon
[1:14:17] from the book of haggai
[1:14:20] until I was in Washington and the Lord
[1:14:21] anointed my heart for it and I'm not
[1:14:24] here to repreach that sermon this
[1:14:25] morning
[1:14:26] but I I thought it this would be
[1:14:28] perfectly in line with the real burden
[1:14:31] on my heart today
[1:14:33] because
[1:14:35] in the book of haggai
[1:14:39] he God comes to the people and
[1:14:42] it's the time of the restoration again
[1:14:46] and there and what are they restoring
[1:14:47] worship and they're there to build the
[1:14:50] temple back
[1:14:52] and you know we we've heard a lot of
[1:14:54] preaching on it recently brother Matt
[1:14:55] was preaching on that recently how that
[1:14:57] you know they're not to to despise the
[1:14:59] day of small things because it wasn't
[1:15:00] going to look like Solomon's Temple and
[1:15:02] and brother Matt pointed out so
[1:15:04] definitely how that that that every time
[1:15:07] there's an iteration of the of the of
[1:15:09] the next Temple it's it's less it's
[1:15:13] smaller it's not it's less beautiful but
[1:15:16] it's greater
[1:15:17] so that by the time you get to Jesus of
[1:15:20] Nazareth he has no Beauty at all that we
[1:15:23] should desire him and he's just one man
[1:15:25] walking the shores of Galilee but in him
[1:15:28] dwelt the fullness of the entire godhead
[1:15:30] bodily
[1:15:33] he was the greatest manifestation of
[1:15:36] this Temple and the whole reason he
[1:15:38] stepped forward to claim a book in
[1:15:41] Revelation 5 that was sealed up and and
[1:15:44] there was no way to get a bride ready
[1:15:46] the church could not go in its condition
[1:15:47] and she couldn't get any better so he
[1:15:50] had to unlock the sealed book and then
[1:15:52] bring that book down into the hands of
[1:15:54] an Angel messenger so that we could feed
[1:15:56] upon it because as brother Brad was
[1:15:58] saying this morning you are what you eat
[1:16:01] and I'm eating my way to a body change
[1:16:03] for the bread oh my goodness I'm eating
[1:16:06] my way to a body change this morning
[1:16:10] but he
[1:16:11] he came heck yeah I came on the scene
[1:16:14] and he you know he the the problem that
[1:16:18] the work had stopped now he's talking
[1:16:20] naturally and for anybody that thinks
[1:16:23] that you shouldn't you know why do we
[1:16:25] need a new church why do we got to redo
[1:16:27] a remodel why do we got to do all this
[1:16:28] we should you know why are we going to
[1:16:30] spend that kind of money and and a lot
[1:16:32] of times it's just people miserly and
[1:16:34] stingy and they don't want to help out a
[1:16:36] lot of times and and and you can say oh
[1:16:39] well you know and you get all these
[1:16:40] arguments all the the heavens you know
[1:16:41] that's his church and it's not a
[1:16:43] building a church ain't a building
[1:16:44] anyway and you hear that that's that
[1:16:46] somehow's just supposed to silence all
[1:16:47] the argument and it works pretty good
[1:16:49] until you run into haggai
[1:16:52] and then you get blasted in the mug when
[1:16:55] you when you read haggai
[1:16:57] because he gets in their face over that
[1:17:01] and he actually ties it back to their
[1:17:03] lives which are just running in circles
[1:17:06] and they're they're the people who've
[1:17:07] come back because Cyrus decreed Cyrus
[1:17:10] got anointed by God and said I'm going
[1:17:12] to send back the Israelites to build a
[1:17:13] house and to the true God
[1:17:16] and so you know Hagia comes on the scene
[1:17:18] and and he's going to look at this this
[1:17:21] unfinished project
[1:17:23] and he's going to say he's going to
[1:17:25] correlate that to their lives
[1:17:27] and he's because he's going to say now
[1:17:29] you look for much he's now he's talking
[1:17:32] about their natural lives I hope you'll
[1:17:34] just put yourself here this morning
[1:17:36] and ask that's what the word comes for
[1:17:38] to measure Yourself by
[1:17:40] e all right so are you willing to look
[1:17:41] into the liberty of God's word today
[1:17:44] he says you look for much and lo it came
[1:17:46] to little
[1:17:48] and when you brought it home I did blow
[1:17:49] upon it
[1:17:52] people get on the rat race of life and
[1:17:55] they and they just run full steam ahead
[1:17:57] and church is lower prioritized and
[1:18:01] fellowship is lower prioritized and
[1:18:03] prayer life is lower prayer terrorist
[1:18:04] and reading the Bible and listening to
[1:18:06] the message and coming you know all of
[1:18:08] these things get prioritized way down
[1:18:10] the list when they should be at the top
[1:18:13] and we're running here and running there
[1:18:14] say well I got to make a living I got a
[1:18:16] family I got to do I got a Bill's got
[1:18:17] this yeah you do but your heavenly
[1:18:18] father already knows that and that's why
[1:18:20] he said seek first the kingdom of heaven
[1:18:22] and it's righteousness and your father
[1:18:24] will add all those things to you why why
[1:18:26] would you want your version of them
[1:18:27] anyway I'd much rather have his version
[1:18:30] of them when I've tried to bless myself
[1:18:32] you know sometimes you say well I kind
[1:18:35] of got ahead well it was it was a mixed
[1:18:37] bag
[1:18:38] it was a mixed bag but when I just let
[1:18:40] him bless me it's just all good
[1:18:43] [Applause]
[1:18:45] think about this young people you young
[1:18:47] men and young women you're starting out
[1:18:48] now in your career starting to make
[1:18:50] money
[1:18:51] you know he he taught I mean here's
[1:18:53] here's here's people they're they're not
[1:18:54] willing to come and work on the house of
[1:18:56] God this is naturally and he's typing
[1:18:58] into spiritual they're not they're not
[1:19:00] they're not paying their tithes and
[1:19:01] offerings to the Lord
[1:19:03] because you know why they think they
[1:19:04] can't afford it and the truth is you're
[1:19:06] a thief if you do that and you can't not
[1:19:08] if you can't afford to not do it
[1:19:12] see and I I was just I was just you know
[1:19:15] encouraging our senior youth group
[1:19:16] sometimes I think in our last thing to
[1:19:18] say listen don't lose sight of that you
[1:19:21] know if you want to be successful in
[1:19:22] this life you obey God's word because
[1:19:24] it's not it's not yours to give it's not
[1:19:26] yours to even decide to give it belongs
[1:19:29] to him and if you keep it you're a thief
[1:19:32] period play an end of story and there's
[1:19:35] no way God can bless you when you do
[1:19:37] that
[1:19:39] I'm not preaching on tithes today I
[1:19:40] don't need to this church is very good
[1:19:42] at giving ties and offerings we were
[1:19:44] accomplished a lot around the world but
[1:19:46] but I'm trying to make these spiritual
[1:19:48] points
[1:19:49] he says why has everything you've chased
[1:19:53] come to nothing and the harder you chase
[1:19:56] it the further away it gets and the more
[1:19:58] chaos
[1:19:59] and if I can just just by next week I'll
[1:20:01] I'll get it and next week comes well by
[1:20:03] next week I'll be there and the next
[1:20:05] week comes and you just find out you're
[1:20:06] just going in a circle
[1:20:08] Where's God Where's God Where's God and
[1:20:11] he's he's right there where he always
[1:20:12] was waiting on you to follow the order
[1:20:14] of his word
[1:20:16] see it's not rocket science anything
[1:20:19] outside of the line in order God's word
[1:20:21] will fail
[1:20:23] see
[1:20:25] and so
[1:20:27] he says so why has it happened to you
[1:20:29] you looked for much you worked hard you
[1:20:33] went strong
[1:20:35] man you you as brother Eddie said you
[1:20:37] shook the bushes
[1:20:38] you you burnt the fields man you went
[1:20:41] you went hard at it he said but it came
[1:20:42] to little and when you and when you
[1:20:44] brought home you're little the Lord went
[1:20:47] and you went where'd all my stuff go
[1:20:49] [Laughter]
[1:20:51] and the Lord asked a question he's not
[1:20:53] waiting on you to ask it
[1:20:55] the Lord presupposes and just asked the
[1:20:58] question on your behalf why
[1:21:01] because of my house that is waste and ye
[1:21:05] run every man into his own house
[1:21:09] see
[1:21:10] so it was all about priorities
[1:21:14] there's been all kinds of
[1:21:16] building projects both naturally and
[1:21:19] spiritually down Through the Ages that's
[1:21:21] what God's been doing we're we're a
[1:21:23] house brother by Adam showed the pyramid
[1:21:25] there and and it speaks of the ages and
[1:21:27] there's faith and virtue and these
[1:21:28] things are all have to be in a in an
[1:21:30] individual believer but they also span
[1:21:32] and talk about the church ages right
[1:21:34] right that's the church
[1:21:36] so they've had all kinds of building
[1:21:38] projects they've they've built you know
[1:21:40] they've had Wilderness Tabernacles
[1:21:42] they've had Revival tents they've had
[1:21:44] Gothic Cathedrals they've had Wayside
[1:21:45] chapels they've had synagogues Temple
[1:21:48] meeting houses storefront missions
[1:21:49] catacombs
[1:21:52] see but one one of the things that
[1:21:55] Eugene Peterson in his translation uh
[1:21:58] his Bible translation called the message
[1:21:59] which I deeply love and uh not all of it
[1:22:03] because sometimes he Waters it down too
[1:22:05] much but just put that in there but but
[1:22:07] he he makes an observation here of all
[1:22:10] these things that they built he said
[1:22:11] there doesn't know there doesn't seem
[1:22:13] sometimes there doesn't seem to be any
[1:22:14] connection between the buildings
[1:22:15] themselves and the belief and behavior
[1:22:18] of the people who assemble in them
[1:22:20] something's wrong with this picture
[1:22:23] you're going you're you're trying to
[1:22:25] build a certain kind of life that looks
[1:22:26] a certain way that you think needs to be
[1:22:28] a certain way but what you're trying to
[1:22:30] accomplish as an end you're you're not
[1:22:32] anywhere your life is even is never
[1:22:35] conducive to that you're never going to
[1:22:36] get there
[1:22:38] because you won't organize the
[1:22:40] priorities of your life according to my
[1:22:42] word
[1:22:45] you know we want to go to heaven
[1:22:48] amen
[1:22:49] well Jesus said that he wanted the Lord
[1:22:52] he in in his prayer that he you know
[1:22:55] that he wanted God's will to be in Earth
[1:22:58] as it is in heaven
[1:23:01] so if you want to go to heaven you need
[1:23:03] to let this Earth become heavenly
[1:23:06] this Earth
[1:23:08] see
[1:23:10] thy will be done
[1:23:12] in this Earth as it is in heaven the
[1:23:15] image you saw that you see of me Lord
[1:23:17] let me today come closer to that image
[1:23:22] I gotta hurry
[1:23:24] so so we find that
[1:23:27] you know it it went on and on because
[1:23:30] but but but now we come to the spiritual
[1:23:33] connection of it all
[1:23:37] because Hagia is pointing out naturally
[1:23:40] now I'm going to just say the natural
[1:23:42] ones I want you to make the spiritual
[1:23:44] ones because I'm not a prophet only you
[1:23:46] know and God knows where the supplies
[1:23:50] hi guys trying to get them to see you've
[1:23:53] spent a lot of money
[1:23:55] but you don't have much to show for it
[1:23:58] no think spiritually
[1:24:00] even you've ran like crazy you've been
[1:24:03] in church for years you've been raising
[1:24:04] a message
[1:24:06] you've read your Bible and heard how
[1:24:07] many thousands of sermons
[1:24:09] how many in 28 years
[1:24:11] how sermons have you heard me preach
[1:24:13] alone just me
[1:24:15] see my family grew up listening to me
[1:24:18] preached I was preaching when my when
[1:24:20] you know right as my children are being
[1:24:23] born I started in the ministry how many
[1:24:25] sermons have they heard me how many
[1:24:27] sermons have my grandchildren heard me
[1:24:29] see
[1:24:31] you've spent a lot of money but you
[1:24:33] don't have much to show for it you keep
[1:24:34] filling your plates but you never get
[1:24:36] filled up
[1:24:38] you keep drinking and drinking and
[1:24:40] drinking but you're always thirsty this
[1:24:43] is what haggy I say unto him naturally
[1:24:46] you put on layer after layer of clothes
[1:24:48] but you can't get warm
[1:24:52] thus saith the Lord of hosts he says
[1:24:54] there in verse seven thus saith the Lord
[1:24:56] of hosts which is God of the Angel
[1:24:58] Armies
[1:24:59] thus saith god of the Angel armies
[1:25:02] consider your ways
[1:25:05] because there's a reason why it's like
[1:25:07] that
[1:25:09] what do I do haggy I
[1:25:12] he said here's what you do here's what I
[1:25:14] want you to do get up in the hills and
[1:25:17] cut some Timber and bring down and
[1:25:19] rebuild this Temple and do it just for
[1:25:21] me in honor of me I would say to you
[1:25:24] alone not because you're going to get a
[1:25:25] golden pot at the end of a rainbow or
[1:25:28] not because you're going to be the most
[1:25:29] popular person but live your life to
[1:25:32] glorify God
[1:25:34] stop living for you and start living for
[1:25:37] him
[1:25:39] living for you is a train wreck it's
[1:25:42] worthless
[1:25:43] [Applause]
[1:25:49] you've had great Ambitions for
[1:25:51] yourselves haggai says but nothing came
[1:25:52] of it but little you do have that you
[1:25:55] have brought to my temple I've blown it
[1:25:57] away there was nothing to it why and God
[1:26:00] ask again why
[1:26:03] you've run around this is a different
[1:26:06] translation from verse 9 to 11.
[1:26:08] while you've run around caught up with
[1:26:11] taking care of your own houses my house
[1:26:13] is in Ruins
[1:26:14] now I'm not talking about our building
[1:26:17] project I'm talking about your house you
[1:26:19] live in
[1:26:23] where's your spirituality
[1:26:26] where's your power with God
[1:26:29] where's your Holiness unto the Lord as a
[1:26:32] sacrifice
[1:26:34] see
[1:26:36] you've you have an assembling of people
[1:26:39] little doubt that the Lord will supply
[1:26:41] you with the proper building but what
[1:26:43] will you fill it with that's the real
[1:26:45] question friends
[1:26:47] so so we do remodel this inside our
[1:26:50] phase three we finally get this to this
[1:26:52] part we remodel it what are we going to
[1:26:54] fill it with what do you want to fill it
[1:26:56] with
[1:26:58] I mean are you sure you want this team
[1:27:00] of preachers
[1:27:02] because I can tell you you got seven men
[1:27:04] who are not going to compromise
[1:27:06] we're going to preach it straighter and
[1:27:08] hotter and harder
[1:27:10] you want a new building we're going to
[1:27:12] put all this labor and all this money
[1:27:13] but what do you want what do you want it
[1:27:14] to be for
[1:27:15] listen what do I preach for why do I
[1:27:18] want you to be I want you to be filled
[1:27:21] with all the knowledge of almighty God
[1:27:24] filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:27:27] see
[1:27:31] so we're to be the living Tabernacle of
[1:27:33] the living God's Dwelling Place
[1:27:37] you go back and
[1:27:39] Deuteronomy and numbers in different
[1:27:41] places in Leviticus and
[1:27:43] you'll find that whether it didn't
[1:27:45] matter
[1:27:46] whether it was
[1:27:48] people bringing their offerings to the
[1:27:49] temple and the priests gathered and they
[1:27:51] had to Gather By The Altar and they had
[1:27:53] to consume the meat Parts the priest did
[1:27:56] and they had to consume it in a clean
[1:27:58] place
[1:28:00] so the church couldn't have funny
[1:28:01] business going on
[1:28:03] the word had to go forth from a clean
[1:28:05] pulpit
[1:28:06] and preachers had to have clean Minds
[1:28:08] and clean Hearts but it also whenever
[1:28:11] whenever the ashes of the heifer the
[1:28:12] Bullock was carried without the camp it
[1:28:14] also had to be a clean place I'm here to
[1:28:16] tell you you come to this clean place
[1:28:18] but when you take this word home when
[1:28:20] you take it home it needs to go home to
[1:28:22] a clean home with clean people with
[1:28:25] clean Minds
[1:28:27] [Applause]
[1:28:30] we're to be the living Tabernacle
[1:28:32] of the living God's Dwelling Place
[1:28:38] in his life story he's told it numbers
[1:28:41] of times and
[1:28:43] my favorite is the 1955 in Los Angeles
[1:28:45] at the Angeles Temple
[1:28:48] brother Brown starts talking about the
[1:28:50] loss of his maybe Sharon Rose and his
[1:28:52] wife Mita
[1:28:53] and uh no I'm sorry he's telling about
[1:28:56] sister hope Branham
[1:29:00] and and he says here
[1:29:02] this is his little girl I put my hand
[1:29:05] over on her I said
[1:29:07] bless you sweetheart
[1:29:09] daddy wanted to raise you with all my
[1:29:11] heart I wanted to raise you and raise
[1:29:13] you
[1:29:13] to love the Lord
[1:29:16] but the angels are coming for you
[1:29:18] sweetheart
[1:29:20] daddy will
[1:29:23] take your little body down and lay it on
[1:29:25] the arms of Mama
[1:29:27] I'll bear you with her
[1:29:29] someday daddy will meet you
[1:29:32] you just wait up there with Mama
[1:29:36] when her mother was dying she had
[1:29:37] already passed away and brother Brandon
[1:29:39] backs up to tell that
[1:29:41] when her mother was dying she said last
[1:29:43] word she said bill
[1:29:45] stay on the field
[1:29:48] she said she said you don't why'd you
[1:29:50] call me back she said I was being
[1:29:51] escorted by these beings and there are
[1:29:54] trees and great birds and flying
[1:29:58] and she said I was at peace and you know
[1:30:00] that's what I've said so many times when
[1:30:02] the prophet went beyond the curtain of
[1:30:03] time he had no trouble describing what
[1:30:04] he heard and what he saw but he couldn't
[1:30:06] describe what he felt what does that
[1:30:09] feel like when all troubles are over
[1:30:11] forever
[1:30:13] oh man this life's journey this hard I'm
[1:30:16] born a man born of a woman is a few days
[1:30:18] and full of trouble when this little
[1:30:20] short life is a vapor it's filled with
[1:30:23] trouble when it's over and I sing on
[1:30:25] that beautiful Shore
[1:30:29] here to tell you this gospel is worth
[1:30:31] living for
[1:30:37] she said bill it's everything you said
[1:30:39] the Holy Ghost was it's divine love
[1:30:41] perfect love
[1:30:48] she says
[1:30:50] stay on the field Bill stay on the field
[1:30:53] and I said she said I said if I'm I said
[1:30:56] if I'm on the field when he comes
[1:30:59] I'll get the kids and meet
[1:31:01] if I'm not I'll be buried with you
[1:31:04] and you go over on the right side of the
[1:31:08] Great Gate he called it one place the
[1:31:09] Eastern Gate east side of the gate
[1:31:12] go to one side of the Great Gate
[1:31:14] [Applause]
[1:31:15] this is so real to him his wife is dying
[1:31:18] this woman he loves and she's slipping
[1:31:21] away she's already crossed and he called
[1:31:22] her back for a few minutes
[1:31:25] and he says and when you see all of them
[1:31:26] come in and he starts talking about when
[1:31:28] you see Abraham Isaac and Jacob and all
[1:31:30] of them coming in he said you stand
[1:31:33] there and start hollering bill bill bill
[1:31:35] just as loud as you can I'm here to tell
[1:31:39] you I don't want anything too quiet
[1:31:40] around here Heaven's going to be a loud
[1:31:43] place
[1:31:44] [Applause]
[1:31:45] just as loud as you can I'll meet you
[1:31:48] there I kissed her goodbye I'm on the
[1:31:50] battlefield today that's been nearly 20
[1:31:53] years ago this was 59 he says I got my
[1:31:55] date with my wife I'm going to meet her
[1:32:00] I was up early this morning and oh the
[1:32:04] last two mornings have gotten up even
[1:32:06] earlier than normal and Lord why are you
[1:32:08] waking me up it's four o'clock and
[1:32:09] laying there and
[1:32:12] you know hour before my alarm even goes
[1:32:14] off which I almost never use because I'm
[1:32:16] always usually awake but
[1:32:20] and I just got up and I just started
[1:32:22] thinking about
[1:32:24] Resurrection morning
[1:32:29] you know I
[1:32:30] I was pondering and I thought and I and
[1:32:33] I and I was just meditating on some
[1:32:35] different things and thinking about this
[1:32:36] sermon today and
[1:32:39] and and and I've got different Bible
[1:32:41] studies that I've got made commitments
[1:32:44] to and different things
[1:32:46] and I was just thanking God I woke up
[1:32:48] this morning and
[1:32:49] it just came out of me so naturally I
[1:32:52] just started saying Lord thank you for
[1:32:54] this word thank you for this life
[1:32:58] oh I could be waking up somewhere with
[1:33:01] them not know you and be a million miles
[1:33:04] from you but I'm waking up today as Son
[1:33:06] of God
[1:33:07] I got another 24 hours another
[1:33:10] opportunity to go forward
[1:33:12] and I'd been thinking that the whole
[1:33:14] morning and and and when you get in
[1:33:16] those Realms hours just fly by you don't
[1:33:19] even realize it's five o'clock it's 5
[1:33:20] 30. and and I'm thinking well sister
[1:33:23] sweetheart I'll be waking up soon I
[1:33:25] should probably make some coffee and and
[1:33:27] I I'm standing there at the pot I'm
[1:33:29] starting to make a little bit of coffee
[1:33:31] and I thought to myself and I I thought
[1:33:33] you know between six and nine in the
[1:33:35] morning wow what If Today Was
[1:33:38] Resurrection morning between six and
[1:33:41] nine and I thought I wonder what time it
[1:33:42] is and I looked at my clock 6 A.M
[1:33:45] 6 colon zero zero
[1:33:50] I didn't know whether to shout run out
[1:33:52] in the street scream or I didn't know
[1:33:53] whether
[1:33:54] it wasn't cry
[1:33:56] there for the longest time
[1:33:58] and I said Lord what if this is that
[1:34:00] morning
[1:34:02] and you know the Lord just seemed to
[1:34:04] come upon me and say I want you to go
[1:34:05] ask the church today what if this was
[1:34:08] Resurrection morning
[1:34:11] oh I said Lord because I was asking him
[1:34:13] you know I and I thought to myself he
[1:34:16] came to me this morning because he knew
[1:34:18] I would believe that word
[1:34:21] and he knew I'd stand here with courage
[1:34:23] and carry it forward to you he knew I
[1:34:26] would try to fill your hearts with with
[1:34:28] faith and and even if we have to go down
[1:34:30] the line of Hagia and it gets a little
[1:34:32] tight I I knew I'm preaching to
[1:34:35] believers
[1:34:36] [Applause]
[1:34:37] such a privilege
[1:34:42] I thought to myself
[1:34:43] what if this was Resurrection morning
[1:34:45] I'm going to tell you something friend
[1:34:47] something that came across my mind I
[1:34:49] said Lord if this was a resurrection
[1:34:51] morning with the same ease that you
[1:34:54] walked into my living room as I said in
[1:34:56] my chair with that sames my family would
[1:34:59] walk right into my living room and I'd
[1:35:01] stand there and see them I'm here to
[1:35:03] tell you it's going to be that smooth
[1:35:04] and that easy one of these mornings
[1:35:07] friends they're just going to be
[1:35:08] standing there and it's going to be home
[1:35:10] going time
[1:35:11] [Applause]
[1:35:14] on Resurrection at my own Resurrection
[1:35:16] morning
[1:35:17] it won't be any more difficult
[1:35:20] for my loved ones to come walking right
[1:35:22] into my living room than it was for him
[1:35:24] you know why because there's Faith
[1:35:26] laying in my heart
[1:35:33] that I don't have to try to have
[1:35:36] that's the beauty
[1:35:38] in fact I in fact I can't even get it to
[1:35:41] go away
[1:35:43] and not only do I not try I have to try
[1:35:45] to get it I can't even get rid of it it
[1:35:48] just it just it's faith it just believes
[1:35:51] it just loves God it just loves his word
[1:35:55] it loves his presence
[1:35:58] [Music]
[1:36:01] I thought about the
[1:36:03] inscription on
[1:36:06] our Statue of Liberty in the harbor
[1:36:10] with Silent Lips
[1:36:13] give me your tired you're poor
[1:36:16] your huddled masses yearning to breathe
[1:36:18] free
[1:36:20] The Wretched refuse of your teeming
[1:36:22] Shore
[1:36:23] send these the homeless Tempest tossed
[1:36:26] to me
[1:36:27] I lift my lamp beside the golden door
[1:36:33] and I thought about the fact that
[1:36:36] oh you know that's interesting because
[1:36:37] it says with Silent Lips
[1:36:40] and that statue is just a statue Lady
[1:36:42] Liberty her lips never move
[1:36:46] she can't she's Stone and meddle she
[1:36:49] can't utter a word
[1:36:52] she doesn't speak at all or say a word
[1:36:55] at all yet
[1:36:57] on just the sighting of her from afar
[1:37:01] disparaged and weary people with broken
[1:37:04] lives take hope again men and women and
[1:37:07] even children
[1:37:09] cry just I've seen old films of of
[1:37:13] refugees coming in from hardship and
[1:37:16] lands afar and they enter the harbor and
[1:37:18] they just see a statue
[1:37:21] with her torch raised up and she it's
[1:37:23] it's called Uh uh imprisoned lightning
[1:37:27] this torch that you see this light this
[1:37:30] lamp is in prison lightning that that
[1:37:33] that that that that I lifted I stand
[1:37:35] beside I lift my lamp beside the golden
[1:37:38] door and you get men and women and and
[1:37:41] and they've come from hardship or from
[1:37:44] tyranny and they're they're weeping and
[1:37:46] they they they hear it they hear a voice
[1:37:48] that's beyond the ears because she
[1:37:52] doesn't speak
[1:37:53] but it's what they're seeing it's an
[1:37:56] image of something what is it friends if
[1:37:58] the world can see you maybe you'll never
[1:38:00] say a word to them but God will see this
[1:38:03] book living inside of you they will see
[1:38:05] this book living inside of you
[1:38:09] oh my
[1:38:11] it's a deep calling in these people
[1:38:14] yearning to breathe free longing it's
[1:38:18] heartbreaking When You See It grown men
[1:38:20] and grown women and children sobbing
[1:38:23] and they're just seeing it she's not
[1:38:25] saying a word
[1:38:28] and I'm not I'm not here to data
[1:38:31] take away that which Millions have
[1:38:34] experienced coming to these Shores by
[1:38:37] you know laying out the sad plight of
[1:38:41] what America has become
[1:38:44] or the
[1:38:46] immoral caused her Freedom exacts upon
[1:38:48] human lives in the 21st century
[1:38:52] I'll only point to what she used to
[1:38:54] stand for
[1:38:55] when she was one nation under God
[1:38:59] you see it was never about a statue in a
[1:39:02] harbor this nation was founded under the
[1:39:04] bloodstained banner of Christ
[1:39:07] men have gotten flawed men
[1:39:09] flawed men for sure history has taught
[1:39:12] us that they weren't perfect men they
[1:39:14] made horrible horrible mistakes
[1:39:16] and and and and we recognize that but at
[1:39:20] the same time they weren't afraid to
[1:39:22] pray and they weren't afraid to take a
[1:39:23] stand for God's word you see great men
[1:39:26] and women both of God raised raised the
[1:39:30] banner high and you know this this
[1:39:33] blood-stained Banner is the is the cross

[1:40:13] drawing card for your loved ones than to
[1:40:16] let Christ be lifted up inside you

[1:41:18] that I might live
[1:41:22] to the Eternal purpose for which he gave
[1:41:24] me life and that you
[1:41:27] may do the same
[1:41:30] when sister hope Branham
[1:41:33] when she's passing away brother tells
[1:41:35] that in 1959
[1:41:36] it had happened many years before 20
[1:41:38] years ago
[1:41:40] the 1930s
[1:41:43] well
[1:41:45] after his encounter
[1:41:47] with his wife at her bedside as she lay
[1:41:49] dying brother Brandon would later
[1:41:51] understand
[1:41:53] that before they met
[1:41:55] at the Eastern Gate
[1:41:58] Had A procession that Jesus would be
[1:42:00] leading
[1:42:01] he found out after he went beyond the
[1:42:03] curtain of time that they actually meet
[1:42:04] right back here first
[1:42:07] they would meet right back here again
[1:42:10] I wonder what I would do and that's why
[1:42:12] I thought this morning I wonder what I
[1:42:13] would do
[1:42:15] if this was that day
[1:42:18] if this was the morning when they would
[1:42:20] come
[1:42:21] between six and nine and that's not an
[1:42:23] established thing because six and nine
[1:42:25] at what time zone I don't know maybe
[1:42:26] it's maybe God's going to do it that way
[1:42:30] maybe as the sun rises and goes around
[1:42:32] the earth he'll just start resurrecting
[1:42:33] them oh my goodness if I got if I got up
[1:42:37] one morning at four o'clock and started
[1:42:39] getting text messages from Australia
[1:42:42] they're already here what
[1:42:45] all right at four in the morning I'd
[1:42:47] call every one of you and get you out of
[1:42:49] bed and say go in your living room it's
[1:42:51] almost time
[1:42:52] [Applause]
[1:42:54] Hallelujah
[1:42:56] I believe it it's not real friends
[1:43:00] Hallelujah
[1:43:06] I was running around and I was thinking
[1:43:08] I was trying to make notes and I and I
[1:43:10] thought oh my well I wonder if there's
[1:43:13] any time left is it nine o'clock yet and
[1:43:15] I looked and it was only 7 52 and I said
[1:43:17] I'm still looking Eastward I'm still
[1:43:20] looking at the Rising Sun could this be
[1:43:23] that happy day
[1:43:25] Hallelujah
[1:43:27] I decided that if this was that morning
[1:43:32] now I'm going to close right here
[1:43:35] when I get finished
[1:43:42] but it's not like brother Diggs 10
[1:43:44] minutes into any sermon I'm feeding the
[1:43:46] clothes don't don't get nervous
[1:43:52] I decided that
[1:43:54] if this was that morning I was thinking
[1:43:56] this at 7 52.
[1:44:00] I said if this was that morning
[1:44:04] I would what would I do
[1:44:07] if I knew any minute
[1:44:09] my loved ones are going to be standing
[1:44:11] in front of me
[1:44:13] what would I do
[1:44:16] I'd go to God first the first thing I
[1:44:19] would do
[1:44:20] is I'd go to God
[1:44:22] and thank him for this
[1:44:25] I would thank him for his word
[1:44:29] I would thank him for his restored word
[1:44:32] in this hour
[1:44:34] that he has given me back every promise
[1:44:36] in the book is mine every chapter every
[1:44:39] verse every line I am standing in his
[1:44:42] love divine every promise in the book is
[1:44:44] mine
[1:44:45] that's what the opening of the seals did
[1:44:47] that's what a mighty angel came down for
[1:44:49] that's what an open book was given to
[1:44:51] you to feed upon
[1:44:53] if this was that morning I would go and
[1:44:55] thank him for his word I would thank him
[1:44:57] not only for sending it but I would
[1:44:59] thank him for the Supernatural and you
[1:45:01] better believe it has to be Supernatural
[1:45:03] I would thank him for the supernatural
[1:45:06] ability to receive it
[1:45:08] and to believe it and to apply it I
[1:45:13] would thank him that I could hear and
[1:45:15] recognize and act upon the word of God
[1:45:18] [Applause]
[1:45:20] I would repent I'd get on my knees and
[1:45:23] I'd repent for all the times when I
[1:45:25] didn't keep its precepts or all the
[1:45:28] times when I didn't walk perfectly in
[1:45:30] its statutes but because of the opening
[1:45:33] of the word I would know that those are
[1:45:35] all under the blood I would know that I
[1:45:38] stand perfect before Christ because I
[1:45:41] when he said I believe the report
[1:45:44] I received him upon uh the whom God sent
[1:45:50] not because of my works
[1:45:53] it's all listen friends
[1:45:56] all of those missteps I want to hear you
[1:45:58] I want you to know today I want you to
[1:46:00] hear it
[1:46:01] when you have fully received Christ in
[1:46:03] this hour
[1:46:06] all your missteps you're like that woman
[1:46:07] who came and Jesus said
[1:46:09] I say unto thee her sins
[1:46:12] which are many
[1:46:15] are all forgiven
[1:46:20] Hallelujah
[1:46:26] a believer
[1:46:28] it's all his grace
[1:46:32] not because of my works I'm neither
[1:46:34] admitted
[1:46:36] nor rejected by success or failures
[1:46:41] you understand that I'm not admitted
[1:46:43] into heaven because of successes
[1:46:46] I'm not rejected from Heaven because of
[1:46:49] failures it is it's nothing but the
[1:46:52] Sovereign Love And The Sovereign Grace
[1:46:54] of almighty God upon my life
[1:46:58] hallelujah
[1:47:00] oh friends May whoever come in I I
[1:47:03] started walking through my house and I I
[1:47:06] started going room to room and I I
[1:47:08] thought tomorrow I went and I started in
[1:47:10] the back bedroom my little girls had
[1:47:12] been there not so little anymore but my
[1:47:14] little girls had spent the night there
[1:47:16] with me and my mom and they're gone and
[1:47:20] my mom's got the bed made back nice and
[1:47:22] I just walked in there and I thought
[1:47:23] about my little angels had been asleep
[1:47:25] right here and they were they were so
[1:47:27] safe and they were so secure because
[1:47:29] they were pebble's house and they were
[1:47:31] under a token home and the Holy Ghost
[1:47:33] was here and Angels were around the
[1:47:35] house and they were able to rest in
[1:47:37] comfort and I laid my hands and I
[1:47:39] thought about them and whoever would lay
[1:47:41] in this bed I said Lord let it be that
[1:47:43] whoever lays in this bed will be filled
[1:47:46] with the Holy Ghost
[1:47:48] I want whoever lays on this bed to be
[1:47:50] filled with all the fullness of the
[1:47:52] knowledge of him
[1:47:54] Hallelujah I started walking through my
[1:47:57] house I started touching my doors I said
[1:47:59] whoever comes in and out of this door
[1:48:00] whoever goes in and out of this door
[1:48:02] whoever goes in and out of this door may
[1:48:04] they come in the power of the
[1:48:06] Resurrection May they know it's a token
[1:48:08] applied home whoever lives here may they
[1:48:10] be safe whoever believes here may God
[1:48:13] prove himself alive
[1:48:17] oh my friends may this home I'm saying
[1:48:21] Lord may this home be a place where your
[1:48:24] word is revered where your word is loved
[1:48:28] where your word is respected and where
[1:48:30] your word is obeyed how many want that
[1:48:33] today Hallelujah that's what I want
[1:48:36] that's that's what I would want if this
[1:48:39] was Resurrection morning
[1:48:43] if this was Resurrection morning I
[1:48:46] thought I was going through my house
[1:48:47] between six and nine saying what would I
[1:48:50] want if this was the morning what I want
[1:48:52] to make sure is in play here
[1:48:54] if this was Resurrection morning
[1:48:59] I wouldn't worry about all the cares of
[1:49:01] this life
[1:49:03] the cares of this life would mean
[1:49:06] very little to me
[1:49:09] if this was Resurrection morning
[1:49:12] the things we spend so much time
[1:49:14] worrying about
[1:49:16] and the things we Chase and the things
[1:49:18] that we
[1:49:19] give ourselves to
[1:49:21] the cares of this life would mean very
[1:49:23] little to me
[1:49:24] I just thought that to myself do you
[1:49:26] agree with that
[1:49:27] if you had got up this morning and an
[1:49:30] angel Gabriel like appeared to Mary
[1:49:32] would have said to you
[1:49:34] good morning highly favored of God it's
[1:49:37] Resurrection morning
[1:49:39] say that's Fantasy Land it happened to
[1:49:41] Mary
[1:49:44] it happened it happened it had
[1:49:47] it happened Gideon it happened to Moses
[1:49:49] it happened to Abraham come on it
[1:49:52] happened to Solomon
[1:49:54] why are you part of that family
[1:49:58] he tends to show up with his family
[1:50:01] Hallelujah
[1:50:05] if this was Resurrection morning
[1:50:07] I wouldn't care what Misfortune had
[1:50:10] befallen me if this was Resurrection
[1:50:12] morning I wouldn't care who had offended
[1:50:14] me if this was Resurrection morning none
[1:50:17] of that stuff would hang on to me any
[1:50:18] longer I would only want I'd only want
[1:50:20] to know one thing am I in love with the
[1:50:24] Lord Jesus Christ my savior does he have
[1:50:27] my whole heart does he have my whole
[1:50:30] mind does he have my whole purpose does

[1:50:40] whole heart your whole mind your whole
[1:50:42] purpose your full commitment

[1:50:48] let me get it there quickly Lord
[1:50:52] I want to tell you some friends I
[1:50:53] thought to myself
[1:50:55] as I was coming out of that beautiful
[1:50:57] Realm had to start getting ready
[1:51:00] I just thought to myself
[1:51:02] is one of the last things I said to
[1:51:03] myself self
[1:51:05] you need to ponder this
[1:51:08] in the morning when you rise
[1:51:10] when you lay your head to sleep and all
[1:51:13] through the day I just need to be saying
[1:51:16] is this Resurrection morning
[1:51:18] God I'm going to go throughout the day
[1:51:20] is the Resurrection coming I'm going to
[1:51:22] go to sleep tonight is the Resurrection
[1:51:24] coming I'm going to wake up the next
[1:51:25] morning is this the morning
[1:51:27] oh how different my life could be
[1:51:31] what an impact it could have
[1:51:36] as I go through
[1:51:39] they're sometimes wearing Journey
[1:51:42] how much more useful
[1:51:44] I could be to the master
[1:51:46] one I want nothing more
[1:51:50] out of this life
[1:51:52] than that
[1:51:55] and when I don't care about any the
[1:51:57] pursuit of anything else
[1:51:59] sure you got families and bills to pay
[1:52:01] and jobs to work so school to attend
[1:52:03] places to go I understand that Paul said
[1:52:06] that we live in the world we can't go
[1:52:09] out of it not yet
[1:52:13] but just don't live like you're of it
[1:52:17] I am from it but I'm not of it
[1:52:19] I did come from its soil and it's going
[1:52:22] to get a it's going to get a baptism of
[1:52:24] fire like I've got and I'm going to get
[1:52:26] a body change like the World's Gonna Get
