TRANSCRIPT
========================================
good morning everyone god bless you let's stand and pray gracious Heavenly Father we just come to you now Lord and we ask that your Holy Spirit would be with us and speak to us Lord that you would take your word and open it to our hearts Lord may it may it be something that challenges us to come a little higher father yes we just want to commit ourselves to you for your glory we ask it in the name of Jesus Christ amen let's read from 2nd Timothy chapter 3 and we're gonna continue on part 2 of Christian character and looking at the paradox of suffering 2nd Timothy chapter 3 and we're gonna start at verse 10 but thou has fully known my doctrine manner of life purpose faith long-suffering charity patience persecutions afflictions which came unto me at Antioch at Iconium at Lystra what persecutions I endured but all out of all of them the Lord delivered me yay and all that live God will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution may the Lord had the blessing to the reading of his word he can be seated so I was listening recently to a message by a non-denominational minister named Eric Ludi and he happened to be speaking a little bit about this topic and he used this illustration and said that for if I were to tell you you need to get ready to do a triathlon and you can say but that's gonna be really difficult and painful and I'm gonna be sore and it's gonna hurt well yeah that's what how you train your body to be able to do that is there's there's a side effect of pain and the reality is as when you live a godly life in this evil world where Satan is the Prince of power of the air the side effect that we get as Christians is suffering that is not naturally produced by living a godly life now if you don't live a godly life you do everything you can to fit in with the world it won't produce suffering just like me when I when someone says train for a triathlon I sit on my couch and drink a cup of coffee and say you go ahead and so I don't have the pain and suffering from working out well the same goes for people who profess to be followers of Jesus Christ if you're a genuine follower of Jesus Christ you will experience suffering you can't get away from it if you're not experiencing suffering then perhaps there's something wrong with your experience or your stand or something needs to take place in your letter needs to be repentance or a complete surrender of your life to Jesus Christ and when you do that you get the side effect of suffering you say well I didn't sign up for that well jesus said take up your cross and follow me that that statement right there at the very beginning should give you the picture yeah because a cross is a place of extreme torture and suffering we not not we're not looking for it we're not going and begging for people to cause us to suffer it's just a fact of how the Christian life works there will be demonic attacks there will be demonic attacks through people against you people will hate you and think they're doing God a service Jesus cetera that's the that's the side effect of living a godly life why would you expect that's when he said all that will live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution as I said I talked about last week were shocked and surprised and surprised and dismayed speak against us when people say hey you can't do that you shouldn't do this why are you doing this and all other kinds of names that they call you expected expected if you're a young person listening expected and what did Paul say in verse 11 what persecutions I endured he didn't just just I'm just gonna take it he'd had endurance he had strength he went through that he didn't quit he didn't give up he didn't stop nothing could stop Paul only death would stop Paul not even prison would stop and so it needs to be the same with us okay people are speaking against you people are coming against you people people want to stop you from what you're doing and they called the master of the house Beelzebub what about those of his household you're going to experience suffering and you should expect it and you should be ready for it and you should say I'm ready to endure because the scripture says he that endures to the end shall be saved then it's not your strength anyways that's the amazing part it's it's his strength but you have to cut the goal go into it with grit the Bible says in Paul writing to the Corinthians quit you like men it literally means be a man Oh sisters say how how am I supposed to be a man Corinthians was not just written to men it was written to sisters as well to women as well and Paul said be a man sister but man he says you're a bride okay so what what what does it mean to be a man well today it means something different but when Paul wrote it when Paul wrote it being a man meant be strong you be the one to take the hit if there's an intruder in the house don't say I believe in women's rights when you go ahead you stand up and you're the one that goes and meets the trouble you're the one that goes and and Paul is writing that to us as Christians sisters brothers beat be a man step up be strong don't be a jellyfish don't be a baby take the hits take the punishment because you have the power to overcome don't don't be shocked or dismayed when people stand against you and don't even be shocked and dismayed when it's people in the church that do it sometimes that's the worst pains that you receive it happens we're not against anybody we're not trying to bring a fight but sometimes people bring the fight to us and the weapons are of our warfare are not carnal we're not retaliating Jesus said turn the other cheek so that doesn't mean that we're just soft and just let people do whatever with us but we respond with love we we try to understand where this person is coming when we try to have compassion we try to say we say I forgive you if you've been forgiven you can forgive others even if they don't ask you for forgiveness you can forgive them anyhow nobody was asking Jesus for forgiveness when he was speaking crucified on the cross he forgave them yeah before they said a word yeah while they were mocking him and so what about you and me Matthew 5:10 through 12 blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake for theirs is the kingdom of heaven blessed are you when men shall revile you and persecute you and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake yeah but I don't feel very blessed when that happens and it feel that sometimes the water is really muddy and you look at yourself and saying maybe I maybe I did something wrong maybe it was maybe it was me and it's coming from another person that confesses to be even a messege believer what should you do how should you respond I don't think the if you've done something wrong you God will reveal it to your heart yeah then you make it right but if you haven't done anything wrong and you know in your heart and your conscience you are doing the will of God and people are coming against you what should you do retaliate what does the Bible say to do yeah love your enemy do good for them was it in Luke Luke 6 is kind of a parallel passage to this I've got it further in my notes but I'll bring it now Luke 6 22 and 23 blessed are ye when men shall hate you and when they shall separate you from their company and shall reproach you and cast out your name as evil for the son of man's sake rejoice ye and that day and leap for joy behold your reward is great in heaven for in like manner did their fathers under the prophets so if people speak against you how should you respond you should leap for joy huh just do it doesn't mean you have to feel it just be obedient leap for joy when people speak against it that goes I want to go cry in my room are you a Christian or no are you a believer or no if you're a believer then you should want to obey the word and the word says if people speak against you leap for joy so let's start leap that's doing some leaping some of you like me my leaping his skills are not good some some some of you that are AIDS challenged you're leaping skills might not be good but just give it a good throw your hands in the air [Music] john stott british theologian wrote how did jesus expect his disciples to react under persecution in matthew Twite 5:12 he said rejoice and be glad we're not to retaliate like an unbeliever nor sulk like a child no lick our wounds and self-pity like a dog nor just grin and bear it like a stoic still less pretend we enjoy it like a masochist what then we are to rejoice as a Christian should and even leap for joy it has to be deeper though than just mere external responses that we train ourselves to do the world the world does that people reform themselves that's fine I'm glad when people reform themselves but that's not Christianity Christianity is a new birth it's a transformation from the inside out so how do I respond to trials suffering persecution the way Jesus told me I ought to respond and there's I'm sure there's more but I looked at this and I saw four different things one was a vision for what God has called you to be to a sense that this is not your home 3 an inner supernatural peace and confidence that every trial comes to us through God's providence for the supernatural power of God in the ables agape love within us so I want to break these down so in 1 a vision for what God has called you to be first John 3:2 beloved now are we the sons of God and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is your carrier of God's life you're a part of God every son is a part of their parents genetically a part of their parents so you're genetically a part of your Heavenly parent you his life courses through your veins so you know who you are in him you know the authority that he has given you as a son of God and your you have the confidence to take that authority it starts right from there jesus knew who he was there was no confusion and he knew God's purpose for him so that when he when he met every trial every difficulty he faced it like a man I think of Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane what what at the hand he knew what was going to happen to him he knew the suffering that was gonna come and he did it he stood there in the dark in a garden he knew this place you just bring salt and he knows he says whatever you do do it quickly so he knows exactly what's coming and he he prays and he's trying to get his disciples to see and eventually he says they sleep on and he's alone completely alone the whole everyone has forsaken him and he stands there and he comes and he's he meets them who are you looking for you and I would say there come let's he could have good me of very easily even even when they tried to throw him off the cliff all he did was just walk through the crowd and he was he could have but he laid his life down now that's a man that is that is what it means to be a man he meant danger he met that for you and me what about us can we meet that for our brothers and sisters did we have that kind of love in our heart to meet suffering and shame head-on like a man say how can you talk about being a man you're crying up there a man experiences all the emotions but he stands up and says I will meet this head-on not for myself but for the glory of God for my love for other people yeah yeah you but you can only do that starting when you know who you are and you know God's purpose for you if you don't know that you're gonna remain confused and you won't have confidence to take your step and take your stand number two a sense that this is not your home it isn't your home we're not citizens here we are citizens of here but ultimately where is our citizenship Philippians 3:20 from the ESV version but our citizenship is in heaven and from it we await a savior the Lord Jesus Christ that's our home that's where we belong is heaven not here Hebrews 11:14 for they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country are you seeking a country do you have a heavenly vision or is your vision focused here and now verse 16 in the same chapter of Hebrews but now they desire a better country that is in heavenly wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God for he hath prepared for them a city God's prepared a city for us are you looking for it are you waiting for it sadly most Christians are just living for the year and now they're looking for prosperity here and now that's that's the hope of most Christians but aren't that's not our hope are our citizenship is in heaven our hope is in heaven we still we understand the truth of the message that the Lord has come down with the shout and yet there's a man interceding for us in heaven and we await to see him literally appear for us we're waiting for that that's where it because that's where our citizenship is that's where we came from revelation 21 verse 4 and this really gives us an understanding when we're going through suffering and trials and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away that's that's where we belong that's where we come from that's where we're going to where there's no pain there's no suffering we can suffer now because there's a joy that is set before us same thing for Jesus he could suffer he could submit himself to a cruel death because of the joy the reward that of the glory that was set before him we can - yeah we can choose the way with the Lord's despise whew we can choose the way of suffering that's what the Christian Way is there's many other ways that are called Christian but the Christian way is the way of trial of difficulty number three an inner supernatural peace and confidence the every trial comes to us through God's providence a lot can be said about this one first scripture that comes to my mind with on this was John 19 9 through 11 and when again into the judgment Hall and saith unto Jesus whence art thou but Jesus gave him no answer then saith Pilate unto him speakest thou not unto me knowest thou not that I am power to crucify thee and have power to release the pilot never talked to a man like this before he was used to people say look I didn't do anything it's not my fault I I can pay you I can do this I can do that he's just silent yeah but when he said this I have power over you Jesus had to correct it jesus answered thou couldst have no power at all against me except it were given thee from above what an understanding he knew some of us we say I don't know in this situation in this situation if God has placed me in this and I don't stop if you're in that situation God has placed you in that situation if you're a Christian you understand that God's providence has you here now for a purpose and whatever is being done whatever is being accomplished he knows sometimes that's just enough he knows yeah yeah and he's with me and whatever you're going through God can God will take care of it Paul had Paul where the first Scripture we read you know the sufferings persecutions that I went through I endured them but the Lord out of them all the Lord delivered me so we have to endure them and we can have confidence the Lord will deliver them that's based at Scripture many are the afflictions of the righteous but the Lord delivered them in the mall doesn't mean it doesn't mean there's no affliction there is affliction many but the Lord will deliver you sometimes that deliverance is that city that we're looking for that's okay that's really good Genesis 50 19 and 20 we know the story of Joseph and his brothers they were afraid he was going to kill him and finally get back with him now that his father was dead and Joseph said unto them fear not for am I in the place of God but as for you you thought evil against me but God meant it unto good to bring it to pass as it is this day to save much people alive I think look I look up look out at all these faces and each one has a story and a testimony of trials and suffering some of you say I don't know I still don't know why that happened I don't I still don't know what the purpose was one day you will some of you do know and you regionally singing glorifying God because of it but those of you that don't know there is a reason the devil minute for evil but God means it for good yeah and to save much people alive so just have that confidence job 2 9 and 10 then said his wife unto him does thou still retain the integrity curse God and die but he said under now speakers as one of the foolish women speaketh what shall receive good at the hand of God and shall we not receive evil in all this did not drove sin with his lips he knew that what was happening to him as much as he struggled as as much as he cried he knew that God was in it and God had a purpose for it God was going to show that to job job just simply had it's up for us to have faith and confidence that God is the orchestrator of all our circumstances I'm not gonna read all the verses but I'm just gonna refer to the story King David was chased out of the capital city Jerusalem by his son Absalom and as he was going one of the sons of one of one of the shimmie I was his name throwing stones and spitting at David and David still had his guard around him and they said we're gonna kill that man for doing that to you David said what if the don't do that the Lord told him to do that to me it may be that the Lord will look on the rock wrong done to me that the Lord will repay me with good for his cursing today David had confidence that God controlled his circumstances that God didn't eat even though he was being cursed spit on stones thrown at him he could entrust himself to the Lord the Lord is the one that takes vengeance not us we commit ourselves to him he can do with us if it's his will for us to die if it's his will for us to go to prison it's his will for us to suffer so be it so be it we rejoice and we live and behave like a Christian regardless of the circumstances and in closing we'll go on number 4 the supernatural power of God that enables agape love that's from Romans 5:5 and hope maketh not ashamed because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us and that enables us to fulfill Luke 6:27 which says but I say unto you which hear love your enemies do good to them which hate you do good to them don't just tolerate them be nice to them be kind do something good for them something God is in control of how you treat me my response is love and you can do that truly do that only by the power of God the power of the Holy Ghost inside of you outside of that you're not able so let's close gracious father we come to you and we thank you so much for your word we thank you so much for its encouragement Lord its conviction its challenge to us Lord yes we need you we can't we can't do these things on our own this is not human thinking this is not human responses this is not human fleshly reactions this is this is this is you this is your character your nature Lord and that's what we want in our lives regardless of the circumstances of situations where we're at where we might not be the disappointments the hurts we want to have the character of Jesus Christ so mold that within us Lord we commit ourselves to you or the service to you in Jesus name Amen god bless you
