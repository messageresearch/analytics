[26:06] when mercy
[26:08] walked in.

[26:16] and wondered
[26:18] just how could
[26:20] this be
[26:23] that someone
[26:25] so guilty
[26:27] had just been set free.
[26:34] My chains were
[26:37] all broken.
[26:39] And I felt born
[26:42] again
[26:44] that moment
[26:46] when mercy

[39:38] &gt;&gt; Sorry you got me tonight.
[39:45] &gt;&gt; Brother Mack text me last night. I
[39:46] thought he was joking so I had to call
[39:49] him. He told me he called me first and I
[39:51] missed the call and he says you done
[39:54] missed the will missed the will of the
[39:56] Lord. So I had to move on. It's like,
[39:59] well, hallelujah. But
[40:02] it was meant to be. I I've had a feeling
[40:04] for a couple days I'd be here tonight.
[40:06] So,
[40:08] here I am.
[40:10] Some of you all that was in Sunday
[40:11] school, it's probably been
[40:14] December last year. I spoke on already
[40:19] judged or free from judgment.
[40:22] I had something different on my heart
[40:24] last night, but
[40:27] you know how it goes. You wake up this
[40:29] morning and this sermon pops back out of
[40:32] my notes to me on my heart wise up
[40:35] praying and it's going to be a little
[40:37] different. It won't be exact the same,
[40:38] but some of the stuff will be the same.
[40:41] But I've I've actually changed it to a
[40:42] sermon. I preached a couple times
[40:43] already. But this is going to be my wife
[40:47] says, "Can't you preach something new?"
[40:49] I said, "Well, I was trying
[40:54] She gets tired of hearing the same stuff
[40:56] everywhere we go, but that's what we do.
[41:02] &gt;&gt; So, Romans chapter 8, let's read verses
[41:04] one down through verses 14. I'll read it
[41:08] fast.
[41:11] Romans 8:1.
[41:14] There is therefore now no condemnation
[41:17] to them which are in Christ Jesus, who
[41:20] walk not after the flesh, but after the
[41:21] spirit. For the law of the spirit of
[41:24] life
[41:26] in Christ Jesus hath made me free from
[41:28] the law of sin and death. For what the
[41:31] law could not do in that it was weak
[41:34] through the flesh, God sending his own
[41:36] son in the likeness of sinful flesh and
[41:39] for sin condemns sin in the flesh.
[41:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. that the righteousness of the law
[41:44] might be fulfilled in us, who walk not
[41:46] after the flesh, but after the spirit.
[41:49] For they that are after the flesh do
[41:51] mind the things of the flesh, but they
[41:53] that are after the flesh the things of
[41:54] the spirit. For to be carnally minded is
[41:57] death, but to be spiritually minded is
[42:00] life and peace, because the carnal mind
[42:02] is enmity against God, for it is not
[42:05] subject to the law of God, neither
[42:07] indeed can be.
[42:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. So then they that are in the flesh
[42:12] cannot please God, but ye are not in the
[42:14] flesh, but in the spirit, if so be that
[42:17] the spirit of God dwell in you. Now if
[42:20] any man have not the spirit of Christ,
[42:21] he is none of his.
[42:23] &gt;&gt; And if Christ be in you, the body is
[42:26] dead because of sin, but the spirit is
[42:29] life because of righteousness. But if
[42:32] the spirit of him that raised up Jesus
[42:34] from the dead dwell in you, he that
[42:37] raised up Christ from the dead shall
[42:38] also quicken your mortal bodies by his
[42:42] spirit that dwelleth in you. For if you
[42:45] live after the flesh, ye shall die. But
[42:47] if you through the spirit do mortify the
[42:49] deeds of the body, ye shall live. For as
[42:52] many are led by the spirit of God, they
[42:54] are the sons of God. May God add a
[42:57] blessing to the reading. Have your
[42:58] seats.
[43:02] I changed the title.
[43:05] It's going to be subjection
[43:08] before a quiddle.
[43:10] Bringing your body under subjection.
[43:14] You know, bringing your body under
[43:16] subjection is not just a suggestion in
[43:18] our Christian walk.
[43:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:20] &gt;&gt; It's a command.
[43:22] So, let's be honest. It's one of the
[43:24] hardest things that you can do is bring
[43:28] your body under subjection.
[43:31] &gt;&gt; The body just wants comfort. It craves
[43:33] pleasure. It resist discipline.
[43:37] We sure do, don't we? The flesh doesn't
[43:40] want to pray. It don't want to read your
[43:41] Bible. It don't want to get up and go to
[43:43] church
[43:45] &gt;&gt; or submit to the spirit of God. It wants
[43:47] its own way and it wants it now. Yeah.
[43:50] &gt;&gt; Every temptation, every compromise,
[43:53] every moment of weakness begins when the
[43:55] body is allowed to lead instead of the
[43:59] spirit.
[43:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:00] &gt;&gt; And that's why this battle is so fierce.
[44:02] Because a body doesn't want to be ruled.
[44:06] It wants to reign.
[44:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Forgot to do something.
[44:13] Forgot to start that timer. I'm not like
[44:16] brother Matt. I won't preach 20 minutes
[44:18] and said it for an hour.
[44:22] He's the only one that can get by with
[44:24] that.
[44:26] But here's the truth. You will either
[44:29] master your body or your body is going
[44:33] to master you.
[44:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:35] &gt;&gt; You'll either crucify the flesh or the
[44:37] flesh will crucify you.
[44:40] Even Jesus
[44:43] in the flesh, when Jesus was in the
[44:45] flesh, showed us what it meant to deny
[44:47] the flesh. You know what happened when
[44:49] he went to the wilderness to be tempted
[44:50] after he was baptized? Went into devil
[44:52] comes to you're hungry. Go ahead and
[44:55] make these stones bread. Jesus was
[44:57] tempted to do so. But Jesus had to
[45:00] overcome the hunger in his flesh. He had
[45:02] to overcome the fleshes. No, man shall
[45:05] not live by bread alone but by every
[45:07] word that proceeds out of the mouth of
[45:08] God.
[45:10] So the devil even in Gethsemane
[45:13] Jesus' own words were say the spirit
[45:16] indeed is willing but the flesh is weak.
[45:20] I mean he even said if it be your will
[45:23] let this cup pass from me but
[45:25] nevertheless not my my will but thine be
[45:29] done. He surrendered to the father's
[45:31] will even if it meant agony. So we're
[45:34] living in a time where the flesh is
[45:36] exalted and the spirit is neglected.
[45:41] &gt;&gt; Whoa. People are ruled by their
[45:44] emotions, their appetites, their
[45:46] desires,
[45:48] even their phones.
[45:51] &gt;&gt; Because the truth is, you can't live a
[45:54] victorious life if your body is out of
[45:58] control.
[46:00] If your eyes, your hands, your mouth,
[46:04] feet, appetites are running wild,
[46:09] you your body's not under subjection.
[46:11] One of I said it again, one of the
[46:13] hardest things we'll ever do is bring
[46:16] this body under subjection.
[46:18] &gt;&gt; But I believe I'm looking at some people
[46:20] this evening that has. If you haven't,
[46:23] you're going to.
[46:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.
[46:25] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about a perfection cuz
[46:28] we're never going to perfect this thing
[46:30] right here.
[46:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:32] &gt;&gt; We'll never perfect this flesh. So, quit
[46:34] trying. I've tried for years to perfect
[46:37] Brad Yachts. It ain't going to work.
[46:39] &gt;&gt; Give up. Give up. That's what we need to
[46:42] do. Give up bringing this body under
[46:46] subjection that sin will no more reign
[46:50] in your mortal body. It didn't say sin
[46:52] wouldn't be there.
[46:54] &gt;&gt; Sin wouldn't reign.
[46:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:56] &gt;&gt; Sin's not going to be my God. Subjection
[46:59] is not your body controlling you. It's
[47:02] you controlling your body.
[47:06] If Paul had to fight this flesh daily,
[47:08] so do we. This is not a one-time
[47:11] victory. It's a daily war.
[47:15] &gt;&gt; Paul was a man filled with the Holy
[47:17] Ghost.
[47:20] He said, "I keep under my body." This
[47:23] means that he brought his body into
[47:25] subjection,
[47:27] &gt;&gt; into discipline, into obedience,
[47:30] &gt;&gt; not just his spirit or his mind, but his
[47:33] physical body. It's a daily dying.
[47:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:37] &gt;&gt; I die daily.
[47:39] &gt;&gt; We need to crucify oursel every day.
[47:43] &gt;&gt; You get up in the morning, go ahead and
[47:45] nail yourself to the cross.
[47:47] &gt;&gt; You're going to die today, flesh.
[47:50] Because 1 Corinthians 9:27 says, "But I
[47:52] keep under my body."
[47:57] I like this word keep under. It means to
[48:02] beat black and blue.
[48:06] &gt;&gt; What? So Paul has said, "I'm beating my
[48:09] body black and blue." He's looking at a
[48:11] boxer because if you read a couple of
[48:13] scriptures before, he's talking about
[48:13] I'm going to run. He's talking about
[48:15] boxing. I'm not going fight into the
[48:16] air. A boxer, they like to hit you right
[48:19] here under your eyes. That's where you
[48:22] get black and blue easy. Sway you up and
[48:25] you can't see him nowhere. You're
[48:26] sitting here boxing like this. You see,
[48:28] you you watched a a big fight where
[48:30] they're like this constantly. You have
[48:31] to get beat in the eyes. They can't
[48:32] hardly see. That's what the devil wants
[48:34] to do to us tonight. But that's what we
[48:36] need to do to our own body. We need to
[48:39] beat our body black and blue and bring
[48:41] it under subjection,
[48:45] which is to treat it as a slave, to
[48:47] discipline it. What does a slave do?
[48:50] You're going to do what I want you to
[48:51] do.
[48:52] &gt;&gt; You're going to go where I say you're
[48:53] going to go.
[48:55] &gt;&gt; You're going to bring this body under
[48:56] subjection and shall not come into
[49:00] condemnation.
[49:02] I done skipped where I'm going.
[49:05] That's my next verse.
[49:07] John 5:24 says, "Verily, verily, I say
[49:10] unto you, he that heareth my word and
[49:13] believeth on him that sent me hath
[49:16] everlasting life and shall not come into
[49:19] judgment,
[49:21] &gt;&gt; condemnation, but is passed from death
[49:24] unto life."
[49:26] &gt;&gt; You don't even have to go to trial.
[49:28] There's no judgment against you, brother
[49:30] JD.
[49:30] &gt;&gt; It says, "You shall not come into
[49:32] condemnation. You shall not come into
[49:35] judgment.
[49:37] Hallelujah.
[49:39] There's no sentence of condemnation, no
[49:42] punishment. We're free from it tonight.
[49:44] You're free. You're free from a
[49:46] judgment. If you've passed from death to
[49:48] life, we do not have to stand in
[49:50] judgment.
[49:51] &gt;&gt; We will not have to stand there. If
[49:54] you're justified, sanctified, filled
[49:56] with the Holy Ghost,
[49:59] &gt;&gt; church, we're free from it tonight.
[50:01] &gt;&gt; You're free from the judgment.
[50:05] We are chosen of God made in his image.
[50:08] Not talking about the flesh man Jesus.
[50:11] &gt;&gt; They none of us right now looks like the
[50:13] Hoffman head of Christ.
[50:15] &gt;&gt; I wish we did,
[50:17] &gt;&gt; but we don't. He's not talking about
[50:19] that flesh man, Jesus. We're made in the
[50:21] image of almighty God. We're not not
[50:24] some man, but God himself,
[50:26] the image of Christ. So if you have the
[50:28] Holy Ghost today, say it again, you're
[50:30] free from judgment.
[50:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Go ahead and tell the devil
[50:34] tonight, you're free from judgment.
[50:36] &gt;&gt; Don't matter what he throws at you,
[50:37] you're free tonight.
[50:41] &gt;&gt; You can say when the judgment takes
[50:43] place, you're not even going to be
[50:44] there.
[50:47] &gt;&gt; In the front,
[50:49] &gt;&gt; you're going to be right behind him
[50:50] being judges.
[50:53] &gt;&gt; We will be around the throne as judges.
[50:55] So there is therefore now no
[50:58] condemnation to them that are in Christ
[51:01] Jesus.
[51:02] &gt;&gt; How many's in Christ Jesus tonight?
[51:05] &gt;&gt; If you're not, don't leave this building
[51:06] until you are.
[51:09] &gt;&gt; You know, when we Paul, he he struggled
[51:12] with himself.
[51:14] &gt;&gt; He battled that old nature.
[51:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:18] &gt;&gt; He has a new one inside of him, but he
[51:19] battled that old nature.
[51:22] We're going to read in in Romans 7:14.
[51:26] We're going to read these verses. When I
[51:27] read these verses, you got to remember
[51:29] Paul is converted.
[51:31] This is not a unsaved Paul.
[51:36] He is letting us know what this flesh we
[51:39] have to deal with while we're living in
[51:41] this thing. So, here's a disclaimer for
[51:44] you tonight.
[51:46] These scriptures will not give you a
[51:48] license to sin.
[51:50] That's right.
[51:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:52] &gt;&gt; I'm going to read the King James version
[51:54] of these scriptures. You know how it is
[51:56] with Romans 7:14 on down through there.
[51:59] If you read too fast, you'll get tongue
[52:00] tied.
[52:03] I do anyway. Just a hillbilling,
[52:05] Tennessee.
[52:07] But I'm going to read the King James
[52:11] and they're going to put up a version of
[52:12] the NLT.
[52:14] I know it's not the King James version,
[52:17] but you'll understand it.
[52:21] I like all the Bible.
[52:25] &gt;&gt; Every version of the Bible is not
[52:26] correct.
[52:29] &gt;&gt; I thought I throw that in. It was free.
[52:31] 7:14. For we know that the law is
[52:34] spiritual, but I'm carnal, sold under
[52:37] sin.
[52:39] So the trouble is not the law.
[52:43] For it is spiritual and good. The
[52:46] trouble is just with me. For I am all
[52:49] too human, a slave to sin. Do you feel
[52:52] that way tonight?
[52:54] &gt;&gt; How many humans do we have in a
[52:55] building?
[52:58] &gt;&gt; Well, the rest of you are angels. Well,
[53:00] we can stand up and see, take the name
[53:02] of Jesus with you. We don't need this
[53:03] tonight.
[53:06] &gt;&gt; How many humans do we have in a building
[53:07] tonight?
[53:09] &gt;&gt; I'm human. Yeah,
[53:13] &gt;&gt; sometimes you know I feel like I can't
[53:15] how can I even be saved being carnal
[53:17] that I am.
[53:19] &gt;&gt; How many how many feels that way
[53:20] sometimes? Brother says in this
[53:24] Jesus made a statement a promise. The
[53:27] inside man says that's true.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; The outside man reasons that it cannot
[53:32] be true.
[53:33] &gt;&gt; And then
[53:35] you ignore the outside man and accept
[53:37] this inside man. That's the same thing
[53:40] that Paul is speaking of. He was sold
[53:43] under the law
[53:45] to carnal sin. Every one of us is the
[53:49] same.
[53:50] &gt;&gt; That's the reason we are have the
[53:54] troubles we do.
[53:56] &gt;&gt; Married four or five times and this and
[53:59] that and all kinds of sin and adulteries
[54:02] and everything else along in our lives
[54:04] is because of these things we are
[54:07] carnal.
[54:09] and that part must perish.
[54:12] But then inside, we're a spirit man,
[54:14] soul inside. That's faith in God's word.
[54:18] We are bringing our outside body under
[54:22] subjection to the word by accepting what
[54:25] God has said.
[54:29] &gt;&gt; Verse 15, for that which I do, I allow
[54:31] not. For what I would, that do I not,
[54:34] but what I hate that do I.
[54:40] In other words, I don't really
[54:42] understand myself
[54:44] &gt;&gt; for I want to do what is right.
[54:48] &gt;&gt; So if you're in sin, you don't want to
[54:49] do what's right.
[54:54] &gt;&gt; He says, "For I want to do what is
[54:56] right, but I don't do it."
[54:59] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[55:00] &gt;&gt; Instead, I do what I hate.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:05] &gt;&gt; How many's there tonight? How many does
[55:07] what you hate? Even today, you've done
[55:09] what you hate. You have Why do we have
[55:11] to repent every day?
[55:14] &gt;&gt; One of the last things you do when you
[55:15] lay bed in the bed at night. God,
[55:17] forgive me what I've done today.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; Again, this is the uncon this is this
[55:25] isn't an unconverted Paul
[55:28] &gt;&gt; when before he didn't care.
[55:32] &gt;&gt; Say what?
[55:33] &gt;&gt; He was a big law man.
[55:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:36] He had Christians killed. He had them
[55:38] stoned. He had them put in prison.
[55:42] &gt;&gt; So, this can't be the same Paul that was
[55:44] back then.
[55:46] &gt;&gt; He's not out running around drinking and
[55:48] smoking and running around with women or
[55:50] or men women.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; That's not what Paul's talking about.
[55:57] &gt;&gt; Again, I want to say this. This does not
[55:59] give us a free pass to sin. Amen.
[56:03] &gt;&gt; If you're a sinner, you don't have these
[56:05] struggles.
[56:09] &gt;&gt; You don't care nothing about it.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; You would do all kinds of things. You
[56:14] just don't care. It don't matter to you.
[56:16] You start drinking, smoking, cussing,
[56:18] running around, listening all kinds of
[56:19] music, and you didn't care.
[56:22] &gt;&gt; You didn't care a bit.
[56:24] &gt;&gt; Verse 17. Now then, it is no more I that
[56:27] do it, but sin that Don't get ahead of
[56:30] me.
[56:32] Thank you.
[56:36] Now that is no more I that do it, but
[56:40] sin that dwelleth in me. So dwelleth.
[56:44] I seen this just a couple days ago. I
[56:45] thought I what dwells really means. It
[56:48] means cohabitation.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; To live together. So when a man and a
[56:55] woman not married, they live together,
[56:58] they're just cohabited.
[57:01] &gt;&gt; They're not married. So it's the way you
[57:04] are. Sin and you live together. You're
[57:08] not married.
[57:10] &gt;&gt; Thank God. We're married to God, ain't
[57:12] we?
[57:15] &gt;&gt; Now you can go. So I am not the one
[57:18] doing it, doing wrong. It is sin living
[57:22] in me that does it.
[57:26] For I know that in me
[57:29] that is in my flesh dwelleth no good
[57:33] things.
[57:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; You keep getting ahead of me.
[57:38] I know that in me that is in my flesh
[57:40] dwelleth no good thing. For to will is
[57:43] present with me. And how to perform that
[57:46] which is good I find not.
[57:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:51] And I know that nothing good
[57:55] lives in me.
[57:59] &gt;&gt; Nothing good. That's why Jesus says,
[58:02] "Call no man good."
[58:06] There's nothing good in us. We always
[58:08] hear that. Oh, he's a good man.
[58:11] We should say that. They are good.
[58:13] There's some good people, but not the
[58:14] good he was talking about.
[58:19] Where am I at?
[58:22] There's nothing good that lives in me
[58:24] that is in my sinful nature.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; I want to do what is right,
[58:30] but I can't.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; He's not talking about his soul.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; He's talking about this sticky nature
[58:40] &gt;&gt; that we live in.
[58:41] &gt;&gt; He's talking about this flesh. You can't
[58:44] trust it.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you say, "I trust my flesh."
[58:48] Tonight, I want you to come up here. I'm
[58:51] going lay hands on you and cast a lying
[58:53] spirit off of you.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; Cuz we can't trust his flesh.
[58:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:00] &gt;&gt; Why would Why would brother Ram say
[59:04] his greatest enemy was himself?
[59:07] &gt;&gt; He didn't say, "My greatest enemy is my
[59:09] wife
[59:10] &gt;&gt; or my husband or the church or the
[59:12] pastor."
[59:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. The greatest was himself because
[59:16] in perfect strength by perfect weakness.
[59:19] Love this message. He says we smother
[59:22] him out. We drive him away. We keep God
[59:28] out of our lives because of our own
[59:30] selves.
[59:33] &gt;&gt; I often said the greatest enemy I got is
[59:38] William Brham. He's the one that gets in
[59:41] God's way. He's the one that gets lazy.
[59:44] He's the one that gets to a place
[59:46] sometimes where he thinks he can do it
[59:49] &gt;&gt; something about it. And when he does,
[59:52] that just shoves God right out of the
[59:55] picture. Amen.
[59:56] &gt;&gt; But when I can get rid of that guy,
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; if we can get rid of this guy,
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; when I can get to a place that he is
[1:00:10] that he is out of the way, then God can
[1:00:13] come over and do things that William
[1:00:16] Brandham knows nothing about.
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; That's when God can use you. That's when
[1:00:23] he can use any of you. He can use
[1:00:26] anybody when we can get out of the way.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; But as long as we get ourselves in the
[1:00:34] way, he can't.
[1:00:37] Verse 19 says, "For the good that I
[1:00:39] would, I do not, but the evil which I
[1:00:41] would not that I do."
[1:00:44] He said, "I want to do what is good, but
[1:00:47] I don't.
[1:00:49] I don't want to do what is wrong, but I
[1:00:52] do it anyway.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; He's like, "What are you even talking
[1:00:56] about?" I don't do nothing wrong. Glory
[1:00:59] to God.
[1:01:03] Did you see that brother at church? His
[1:01:05] hair was sticking up in the back.
[1:01:08] You did nothing wrong, huh?
[1:01:15] Wow.
[1:01:17] We're in a battle.
[1:01:19] Yes. Amen.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; We're in a battle.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; We're not battling against our wives and
[1:01:24] husbands.
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; We're battling against this thing right
[1:01:27] here.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; Constantly, day in day out, battle this
[1:01:30] thing right here.
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; Now, if I do that, I would not. It is no
[1:01:39] more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth
[1:01:41] in me.
[1:01:43] But if I do what I don't want to do, I'm
[1:01:45] not really the one doing it.
[1:01:49] I'm not the one doing wrong. It is a sin
[1:01:51] living in me
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; that does it. So then if I find then a
[1:01:56] law that when I would do good, evil is
[1:02:00] present.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; He says, I have discovered
[1:02:06] this principle of life that when I want
[1:02:08] to do what is right,
[1:02:11] I'll always do what is wrong.
[1:02:15] Goodness.
[1:02:17] As long as we're in this body, we have
[1:02:19] sin.
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; But says in believing God, this outside
[1:02:23] is sin.
[1:02:26] Do you know your body's sin? That's the
[1:02:28] reason you don't try to perfect that
[1:02:31] body. It's sin.
[1:02:34] Did you know that?
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; He asked a question, not me. It was born
[1:02:38] in sin, shaped into iniquity, come into
[1:02:41] the world speaking lies. And that soul
[1:02:44] is the same way
[1:02:47] Your soul was the same way your flesh
[1:02:49] was one day. It was dark with sin.
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; But
[1:03:00] when that soul is born again of God,
[1:03:02] then that soul can't die.
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; The soul that sins sinnth shall die.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; But he that believeth on me has
[1:03:12] everlasting life.
[1:03:15] Amen.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; Then that then there is an immortal life
[1:03:20] living in that body.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; That's like a stream coming from heaven
[1:03:26] like a core inside of a man.
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; That's the part that's godly.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; It operates this body.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; But before this body can ever become
[1:03:40] perfected, the spirit will bring it into
[1:03:43] subjection. Amen.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; To God to make you in a war all the time
[1:03:50] a constant. Paul says we will never get
[1:03:53] more than he
[1:03:55] when I would do good that evil is near
[1:03:58] me.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; So there's a constant war the flesh
[1:04:01] against the spirit. Verse 23. But I see
[1:04:03] another law in my members war against
[1:04:06] the law of my mind bringing me into
[1:04:09] captivity to the law of sin which is in
[1:04:12] my members.
[1:04:14] But there is another power within me
[1:04:17] that is at war with my mind. This power
[1:04:20] makes me a slave to sin that is still
[1:04:23] within me.
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; He's talking about the battle
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; between the flesh and the spirit.
[1:04:31] You remember the story of the old Indian
[1:04:32] chief?
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; How you doing, chief?
[1:04:39] Pretty good. Pretty bad. I don't make a
[1:04:41] good Indian, so I ain't going to try.
[1:04:44] He said, 'Well, how do you mean pretty
[1:04:46] bad, pretty good? He says, 'Well, since
[1:04:49] me received the Holy Ghost, there's been
[1:04:52] two dogs in me.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; I know some preachers preach there's no
[1:04:56] two dogs.
[1:04:58] Shame on them.
[1:05:01] Well, since me received the Holy Ghost,
[1:05:04] there's been two dogs in me.
[1:05:07] One of them a black dog, one of them a
[1:05:09] white dog. And they argue all the time.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; You're going to get up. You're going to
[1:05:16] go to church. No, I ain't. I'm too
[1:05:18] tired.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; They'll just growl at one another.
[1:05:29] The white dog wants me to do good. The
[1:05:33] black dog wants me to do bad. Well,
[1:05:36] chief,
[1:05:37] which one of them wins?
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; It depends on who chief feeds the most.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; You go around say, "I can't seem to
[1:05:50] bring my body under subjection."
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; Who you feeding?
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; Who you feeding the most?
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; I think Brother Jayce will be back on
[1:06:04] Sundays. Don't worry.
[1:06:09] I try to control my tongue. I try to
[1:06:12] control my temper, but I can't.
[1:06:15] Who you feeding?
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; Oh, if we're not praying and reading the
[1:06:23] Bible like we should, our flesh controls
[1:06:26] us.
[1:06:28] Oh, but we'll get up first thing in the
[1:06:29] morning.
[1:06:33] I posted a picture last night. three
[1:06:37] likes,
[1:06:43] we'll move along.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; But if we feed that spiritual man a
[1:06:49] daily diet of the word,
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; this body will do what I tell it to.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; You're going to get up. I don't care if
[1:06:59] it is 5:00 in the morning. You're going
[1:07:01] to get up, get you a cup of coffee.
[1:07:02] You're going to go over in your chair.
[1:07:05] I'm sure brother Jason tells his body
[1:07:07] this every morning. You're going to get
[1:07:08] up and go to that chair.
[1:07:11] You're going to sit in it and you're
[1:07:13] going to talk to God.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; Then you're going to read your Bible.
[1:07:18] And then if you got time before you go
[1:07:20] to work,
[1:07:22] then pick this up.
[1:07:25] Don't worry. I got 21 minutes and 46
[1:07:28] seconds.
[1:07:33] Glory.
[1:07:36] I hope it's all right.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; You'll say, "But I'm tired. I've worked
[1:07:42] all day. I started work at 8:00 and I
[1:07:45] started sweating and I didn't sweat till
[1:07:47] I got off work. I'm tired."
[1:07:51] Water hooks preaching tonight.
[1:07:54] If it's Brad Ys, I'm not going.
[1:08:03] I'm just gonna stay home and stream. I
[1:08:06] wonder who's preached at brother
[1:08:07] Donny's.
[1:08:13] Who you feeding? It don't matter who's
[1:08:16] up here.
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; I'd rather be sitting right there with
[1:08:20] my wife listening to brother Caleb or
[1:08:22] brother JD standing right here.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. Or brother Matthew, you're
[1:08:25] here.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; Who you feeding?
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; Who you feeding?
[1:08:34] You'll say, "No,
[1:08:36] you're going to get up off that
[1:08:38] recliner. You're going to go in the
[1:08:40] bathroom and take a shower. You're going
[1:08:41] to get dressed. You're going to church.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; You're going to do what I tell you
[1:08:46] you're going to do."
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah, I might do that, but I'm gonna go
[1:08:49] to church. I'm gonna sit my arms folded
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; cuz I don't like him.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; It's hot in here.
[1:09:09] Well, brother Tony ain't leading the
[1:09:11] singing tonight. It's brother Ken.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; Who you feeding?
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; It don't matter who's leading the
[1:09:19] singing.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; You come to worship God.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; I worship him in spirit and truth.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; That was free, too.
[1:09:31] You're going to sing. You're going to
[1:09:32] clap your hands. You're going to worship
[1:09:35] God. And when the preacher gets up there
[1:09:37] and start preaching, you're going to
[1:09:38] amen.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; That's better.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; You're going to say hallelujah.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; If something hits you again, say, "Glory
[1:09:46] to God."
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; Say it again, preacher.
[1:09:57] You're going to bring your body under
[1:09:59] subjection.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; I'm never going to get out of Romans 7.
[1:10:04] You're going to bring your body under
[1:10:06] subjection. Do you see where Paul comes?
[1:10:08] This next verse. Oh wretched man that I
[1:10:12] am.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; That's right. Who shall deliver me from
[1:10:17] this body of death?
[1:10:22] Oh, what a miserable person I am. How
[1:10:25] many feels that way sometimes.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; Who will free me from this life
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; that is so dominated by sin
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; and death? Who will deliver me from this
[1:10:39] flesh body that we live in?
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:43] Paul is saying, "We're held captive by
[1:10:45] this flesh."
[1:10:47] You know, when Paul was in prison, he
[1:10:49] was chained to a soldier.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; So, wherever Paul went, that soldier
[1:10:53] went.
[1:10:56] So, Paul had to go to the bathroom,
[1:10:57] there went the soldier.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; Paul sit down to eat, there went the
[1:11:00] soldier. Paul went to pray, there was a
[1:11:02] soldier right beside him.
[1:11:05] Man, poor guy. I had to listen to Paul's
[1:11:07] prayer.
[1:11:09] Paul was writing out the the books. The
[1:11:12] soldier was watching what he was
[1:11:14] writing. He was dragging him around. He
[1:11:16] liken It's likened that to we're chained
[1:11:18] to a dead man.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; That's what we are. We're a bunch of
[1:11:22] dead people.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; We're dragging these old bodies around.
[1:11:27] We'll drag these old things to work.
[1:11:29] We'll drag these things to Walmart.
[1:11:31] We'll drag these things into church. Sit
[1:11:33] down right there and don't move.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:39] Oh, wretched man that I am.
[1:11:44] Who is going to save me?
[1:11:48] I thank God.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; Through Jesus Christ our Lord.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; So then with the mind, he ain't talking
[1:11:55] about this right here. Well, he's
[1:11:57] talking about the mind is the soul.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; So then with this mind, I myself will
[1:12:04] serve the law of God.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:07] But with this flesh, the law of sin,
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; sin is to miss the mark.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; Fall short, make a mistake. We all know
[1:12:14] that. So, but a man that is born of God,
[1:12:18] what a paradox.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; Cannot commit sin.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; We are going to bring this body under
[1:12:27] subjection.
[1:12:29] Brother says, do you know your body is
[1:12:32] sin? That's the reason you don't try to
[1:12:34] perfect that body. Amen.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; It's sin.
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; Did you know that?
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You know, Paul no doubt
[1:12:45] wondered,
[1:12:47] "How can I even be saved
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; with this sin body I'm living in? Why is
[1:12:53] this body always causing me problems?"
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; We think the same way. Why is this thing
[1:13:02] always causing me issues? Amen.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; Wherever I go, I got problems.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; This thing is causing me problems.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; Is there anybody who can deliver me?
[1:13:15] You know, sometimes I don't even feel
[1:13:16] like a Christian.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; Well, two of you don't.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; How can I be a Christian with that
[1:13:26] thought went through my head?
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; How can I be a Christian when I said
[1:13:31] something I shouldn't have? Amen.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; I'm going get a little honest with you.
[1:13:37] I think I did this during Sunday school,
[1:13:39] but
[1:13:43] you know, when you go into a store,
[1:13:46] we'll use Walmart. It's a bad place, but
[1:13:52] we all used to listen to stuff we
[1:13:53] shouldn't have listened to, right?
[1:13:57] Some of some of you still do,
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; but anyway, but you're going to Walmart
[1:14:02] and you hear a song you heard years ago.
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; For me, when I say years ago, 80s
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; and what's bad, I'll walk through
[1:14:15] Walmart and I'll be singing it before I
[1:14:19] know what I was even doing.
[1:14:23] Yeah.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot. I was among
[1:14:28] angels tonight.
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; You know, you'll sit at a restaurant,
[1:14:38] you'll hear the music, you'll just tap
[1:14:40] your fingers a little bit.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; Then you're like, "What in the world?"
[1:14:44] Anybody here from church?
[1:14:51] Oh wretched man that I am, who will
[1:14:55] deliver me?
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; No wonder when Paul comes to 81, we
[1:15:00] finally made it back.
[1:15:02] Therefore,
[1:15:04] there is therefore now no condemnation
[1:15:08] to them which are in Christ Jesus.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; Thank God.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; No judgment. That's right.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. If you're in Christ,
[1:15:24] you're not judged. You're not guilty.
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; You are free from condemnation. You're
[1:15:30] being declared innocent by Christ. And
[1:15:33] the only way we can be free is that you
[1:15:36] are in Christ.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; Not some man.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:42] But Christ,
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; the final verdict
[1:15:49] not guilty.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; No punishment.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; So there is therefore now no punishment
[1:15:57] to you that are in Christ Jesus.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; There's no evidence against you.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; So you can go say, "What sin?
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; What sin?"
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; That's right. Cuz when you ask for
[1:16:11] forgiveness,
[1:16:13] you say, "How quick does my sins are
[1:16:15] forgiven?" How quick can you say, "God,
[1:16:18] forgive me?"
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; Just like that, your sins are in the sea
[1:16:24] of God's forgetfulness.
[1:16:28] We need to quit asking God to forgive us
[1:16:30] of our sins. We'll ask God every day.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; Lord, I did this thing 15 years ago.
[1:16:37] God, please forgive me.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:16:42] I did that one time.
[1:16:45] I kept praying for something I'd done
[1:16:46] years ago.
[1:16:48] I guess God finally got tired of it.
[1:16:51] It's like he spoke to your heart. You
[1:16:52] know how it is. It's still small voice.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; What are you talking about?
[1:16:57] All I hear is what's coming out of your
[1:16:59] mouth. You're confessing something you
[1:17:00] did years ago. I don't even remember it.
[1:17:02] It's under the blood.
[1:17:07] You say, "But you don't know what I've
[1:17:09] been through."
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; No, I may not. It don't matter. It don't
[1:17:15] matter what you done.
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; The blood of Jesus is here to free us
[1:17:21] tonight.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; Romans 4:25 said, "Who was delivered for
[1:17:26] our offenses."
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; "And was raised again for our
[1:17:31] justification." Amen.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; This word right here used in
[1:17:34] justification only used two times in the
[1:17:36] Bible. The other one is Romans 5:18.
[1:17:39] Therefore, as by the offense of one
[1:17:42] judgment
[1:17:43] came upon all men to condemnation. Now,
[1:17:47] he's talking about Adam.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; What happened to Adam and Eve caused sin
[1:17:50] and death in the world.
[1:17:53] That one judgment brought sin and death
[1:17:55] to the world. But
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; I had to put that in there. That's fun.
[1:18:01] Even so, by the righteousness of one
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; free gift.
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; How many like gifts?
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; We got one tonight. And it's free.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; You don't have to pay for this one.
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; You shouldn't have to pay for a gift
[1:18:18] anyway, should you?
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; Brother Chris, you brought me a gift.
[1:18:21] You say, "Here, you'll be $20. You keep
[1:18:23] it."
[1:18:28] No mercy.
[1:18:31] Even so, by the righteousness of one
[1:18:33] free gift, that's God came down, become
[1:18:36] a man, died for you.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; The righteousness of that one free gift
[1:18:39] came upon all men unto the justification
[1:18:43] of life.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; And justification here means just one
[1:18:48] little word,
[1:18:50] a quiddle.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:54] a judgment that a person is not guilty
[1:18:58] of the crime in which that person has
[1:19:01] been charged.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; 10 minutes.
[1:19:11] I was in a courtroom one day.
[1:19:15] The prosecutor had all these charges
[1:19:17] against me.
[1:19:19] He was looking for the death penalty.
[1:19:23] If you couldn't get the death penalty,
[1:19:24] he wanted a life without parole.
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; He wanted me. He wanted to destroy me.
[1:19:31] He wanted me for himself. He wanted me
[1:19:33] to be con convicted. You know when you
[1:19:36] get in a court, you hear all rise.
[1:19:40] Everybody stands up. I stood up and
[1:19:42] looked and out come the judge.
[1:19:46] And it was God himself.
[1:19:49] I said, "This is going to be a fast
[1:19:50] trial.
[1:19:51] I'm dead.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; All right, prosecutor. What you got for
[1:19:58] me?
[1:20:00] You know how the them lawyers do?
[1:20:02] They'll walk back and forth. They'll go
[1:20:04] to jury and try to stir them in the face
[1:20:05] and try to convince them what you've
[1:20:07] done is wrong.
[1:20:09] I bring charges against Brad J.
[1:20:13] He has failed time and time again. He's
[1:20:17] lied. He's thought evil. He's
[1:20:20] He's gotten angry.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; He's lost his temper.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; Had impure thoughts. He's rebellious.
[1:20:28] I've got that on record.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; Every thought, every word, every action
[1:20:34] has been recorded. And even today, we're
[1:20:37] getting more evidence on him.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; Satan starts sneering at the judge.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; He know he was God. He says, "Now don't
[1:20:46] tell me you don't see it, God.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; You are just, aren't you?
[1:20:55] You must condemn the guilty."
[1:20:58] Cuz your own word says, "The soul that
[1:21:01] sinnth shall die."
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; But what he didn't realize, he didn't
[1:21:06] catch the revelation.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; He said, "The soul that sinnth."
[1:21:12] Just hold that thought.
[1:21:21] The prosecutor didn't really catch the
[1:21:23] revelation. He didn't know
[1:21:30] that from my soul I have passed from
[1:21:32] death to life.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; All he sees is what I've done right
[1:21:36] here.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; He does all of this. He says Brad
[1:21:44] Johnson done all he's been an evil
[1:21:46] person.
[1:21:48] He's the prosecution rests.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; He thought he had it won
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; cuz he looks over in my chair.
[1:21:58] He's by himself.
[1:22:00] No lawyer take his case.
[1:22:06] The judge just looks at me from the
[1:22:09] evidence that's been presented today.
[1:22:12] It looks like you're guilty.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; The evidence is stacked up against you.
[1:22:18] Your accuser has said you have done this
[1:22:20] and you have done that. Where's your
[1:22:23] lawyer?
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; Come on,
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; your honor.
[1:22:29] I have no defense.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; No lawyer will take my case.
[1:22:37] They know I've done wrong.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; There's no way I could win this. I can't
[1:22:42] even get a fair trial.
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; How do you plead then?
[1:22:50] I was fixing to say guilty.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; But before I went, that door slams open
[1:22:58] and it storms somebody. I'll take his
[1:23:01] case.
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; Prosecutor turns and looks and sees
[1:23:08] Jesus walking down the aisle. Amen.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; Still has blood on him.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; He says, "I'll be his lawyer.
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; I'll take his case." Aren't you glad
[1:23:24] tonight we've got somebody that'll take
[1:23:26] your case.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; Devil turns and looks at Jesus. Are you
[1:23:34] crazy?
[1:23:35] Didn't you hear all the evidence? You
[1:23:38] even know he's done these things?
[1:23:41] Yeah.
[1:23:44] You won't hear your defense lawyer
[1:23:45] saying, "Yeah, I know he did these
[1:23:48] things."
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; But what you don't know, devil, that
[1:23:51] I've placed something down on the inside
[1:23:53] of him before the foundation of the
[1:23:55] world. He can't be lost.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:04] Christ comes in says, "We got new
[1:24:07] evidence though, your honor.
[1:24:10] We got new evidence to prove that he
[1:24:12] didn't do it. He is falsely accused and
[1:24:16] I can prove it."
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; We have new blood evidence that will
[1:24:24] prove his innocence.
[1:24:31] Amen.
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; In court, blood evidence can convict or
[1:24:37] acquit,
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; Depending on whose blood it is.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The blood speaks.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad the blood speaks for you
[1:24:49] tonight? It's like when Adam when a Abel
[1:24:51] was bringing that lamb to sacrifice
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; and he picks that lamb up and throws it
[1:24:56] on the altar, grabs a rock and starts
[1:24:58] cutting his throat. That blood spurting
[1:24:59] out. That blood was speaking for Abel.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; When Jesus went to Calvary,
[1:25:07] [Applause]
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; that spirit pierced his side. Blood
[1:25:11] dropped down. The blood spoke for you,
[1:25:14] Chris.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; The blood spoke for you, Brother Steve.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; The blood speaks.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; I stowed this from brother David Siler.
[1:25:26] It was so good. Not all of it, but some
[1:25:29] of it's good.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; DNA.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; We know what DNA does today.
[1:25:38] People's been in prison for years and
[1:25:40] years over a crime.
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; But they have DNA comes out and these
[1:25:44] people are set free.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; It's all about the blood.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Look at me. It's all about
[1:25:58] this blood.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; I paid the price for you.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; Your honor,
[1:26:11] though he never done it.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; Oh, what a defense I had. What a lawyer.
[1:26:22] He had a 100% acquitt rate.
[1:26:26] Amen.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; You know, some lawyers, they want to try
[1:26:29] to settle out of court.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, we we'll sell this thing out of
[1:26:34] court. You go ahead and pay us so much
[1:26:36] money and we'll we won't go to court.
[1:26:38] We'll drop it.
[1:26:42] That proves you're guilty.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; Anybody settles out of court, you're
[1:26:45] guilty.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; Jesus says, "I'm not settling this thing
[1:26:50] out of court. We're going to trial."
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:58] I'm glad he did.
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; If you got mercy on your as your lawyer,
[1:27:07] you can't lose.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; By the time our lawyer was finished,
[1:27:14] there was nothing the prosecutor could
[1:27:16] say. Amen.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; When my lawyer finished, he says the
[1:27:23] defense rests.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; So, you know what happens after that?
[1:27:31] The case is sent to the jury. The judge
[1:27:34] says, "Jury, you go back there into the
[1:27:37] back room there. Y'all talk it among
[1:27:39] yourselves and come back with a
[1:27:41] verdict."
[1:27:44] The devil didn't pay much attention that
[1:27:46] we was in a stacked court.
[1:27:49] That God was the judge, God was the
[1:27:52] jury, and God was my lawyer.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; He says, "We need we don't need to go in
[1:27:57] a back room to deliberate.
[1:27:59] We've got our verdict right now.
[1:28:03] Not guilty."
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; What?
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; Did you see what he just did today?
[1:28:12] not guilty.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; The judge just looks at me and says,
[1:28:21] "You're not guilty. You're free to go."
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; All the charges have been dropped.
[1:28:28] So therefore, there is now no
[1:28:30] condemnation to them who are in Christ
[1:28:33] Jesus.
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; Thank God.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; Thank God.
[1:28:41] The judge himself became our attorney.
[1:28:45] God became man. There was no attorney
[1:28:48] that could do it. We couldn't find one.
[1:28:52] Moses and the law, the prophets, they
[1:28:55] couldn't do it.
[1:28:57] So, the judge became jury, attorney, and
[1:29:01] judge.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; Stacked court. Like I said,
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; it's like Donald Trump. He's got a stack
[1:29:11] court. He's got a stack Congress.
[1:29:16] So, anything he says he wants to pass
[1:29:18] law, he can do it.
[1:29:21] When God says you're not guilty, nobody
[1:29:23] can stand in front of him and says, "But
[1:29:25] you're wrong, God." You know in a in
[1:29:28] port of law
[1:29:32] 19 seconds over.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; What's brother Matt say? Overtime.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; I'm about finished though.
[1:29:43] There's a law. If you've been tried and
[1:29:46] found not guilty,
[1:29:49] you can't be tried of that again.
[1:29:52] [Applause]
[1:29:55] So when the devil
[1:29:57] tries to bring you back up to court,
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; comes back up front of God,
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; what are you doing, devil? He says
[1:30:07] that Brad Campbell, do you know what he
[1:30:09] done today?
[1:30:12] I said he's
[1:30:14] not guilty, devil. They throw him out.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; You're in contempt of court. That's 30
[1:30:20] days in jail.
[1:30:24] You don't even have a case.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:30:32] Says when he becomes both judge and jury
[1:30:34] and attorney, he pleaded our case.
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; We found guilty by his own law.
[1:30:46] He come and took the guilty person's
[1:30:48] place that was in the sanctuary. He took
[1:30:50] your sin and took it upon himself and
[1:30:54] died and paid the price and shed his
[1:30:57] blood and gave back his own token, his
[1:31:00] own blood, his own life.
[1:31:06] Why?
[1:31:09] We are perfect.
[1:31:11] Goodness, the case is dismissed. There
[1:31:15] is no more sin to the believer.
[1:31:18] Oh God have mercy. If the people can't
[1:31:21] see that that there is no more case
[1:31:26] cuz he that heareth my words and
[1:31:28] believeth on him that sent me has
[1:31:30] eternal life
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; and shall not come to judgment but has
[1:31:35] passed from death unto life. There is
[1:31:38] the case
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; case dismissed.
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; Let's all stand.
[1:31:46] case dismissed. No more case to it. He
[1:31:51] says, "And how that we are perfected,
[1:31:54] perfected, absolutely spotless and
[1:31:57] blameless. Not one sin on us."
[1:32:03] He says, "Are you above temptation?"
[1:32:06] Never. Do you sin every day? Yes, sir.
[1:32:12] But we are perfected because we are in
[1:32:16] him. And God could no more judge us than
[1:32:21] nothing.
[1:32:23] Cuz when he judged Christ, he judged me.
[1:32:26] He judged you. And he can't judge me
[1:32:28] again because he took my judgment.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; So today we are free.
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; Free from condemnation.
[1:32:41] Hallelujah.
[1:32:43] Y'all sing something.
[1:32:45] I'll keep preaching.
[1:32:49] From subjection
[1:32:52] to the acquitt.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:05] I'm so thankful when they ran that blood
[1:33:07] back.
[1:33:10] That blood spoke for me and it was the
[1:33:14] sinless blood.
[1:33:21] I stood in
[1:33:23] the courtroom.
[1:33:26] The judge turned
[1:33:29] my way.
[1:33:31] Well, it looks like
[1:33:34] you're guilty
[1:33:36] now. What do you say?
[1:33:41] [Music]
[1:33:44] I spoke of
[1:33:47] your honor.
[1:33:50] I have no
[1:33:53] defense.
[1:33:55] But that's when
[1:33:58] mercy.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:04] Oh,
[1:34:06] mercy
[1:34:08] walked in
[1:34:10] and he pleaded
[1:34:13] my case.
[1:34:16] Called to the stand.
[1:34:20] It was God's saving
[1:34:24] grace.
[1:34:26] The blood was
[1:34:29] presented and it was Jesus blood covered
[1:34:33] my sins.
[1:34:37] Oh, I was forgiven
[1:34:42] when mercy
[1:34:44] walked in.
[1:34:49] Oh, I stood there
[1:34:52] and I wondered
[1:34:55] how could
[1:34:57] this be
[1:35:00] that someone so
[1:35:03] guilty
[1:35:05] had just been set free.
[1:35:13] My chains were
[1:35:15] all broken
[1:35:18] and I felt born
[1:35:20] again
[1:35:22] that moment
[1:35:26] when mercy
[1:35:28] walked in.
[1:35:31] Oh
[1:35:34] mercy
[1:35:36] walked in and he pleaded
[1:35:41] my case
[1:35:44] called
[1:35:47] stand.
[1:35:48] [Music]
[1:35:54] The blood was
[1:35:57] presented
[1:35:59] and it covered
[1:36:01] my sin.
[1:36:05] I was forgiven
[1:36:09] when mercy
[1:36:11] walking.
[1:36:13] One more time.
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; Oh
[1:36:17] mercy
[1:36:19] walked in.
[1:36:22] and he pleaded
[1:36:24] my case.
[1:36:27] He called to the stand. It was God's
[1:36:33] saving
[1:36:35] grace.
[1:36:37] The blood was
[1:36:40] presented
[1:36:42] and it covered
[1:36:44] my sin.
[1:36:47] [Music]
[1:36:49] I was forgiven
[1:36:52] when mercy
[1:36:55] walked in.
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:00] Hallelujah.
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad? Aren't you glad?
[1:37:10] Looks like I have one prayer request. I
[1:37:12] believe this from brother Jason.
[1:37:16] I put these things on. I can't. It's
[1:37:17] very lengthy, but I'll read it all. He
[1:37:19] says, "Please have prayer for a woman
[1:37:22] that Sister Debbie and I met in a while
[1:37:25] out of town yesterday who has stage four
[1:37:28] lung cancer that has already spread to
[1:37:30] other places in her body and has a short
[1:37:32] time to live unless the Lord has mercy
[1:37:34] on her. She is a part of a
[1:37:37] non-denominational church and is looking
[1:37:38] for the Lord for healing." I was able to
[1:37:41] instruct her more perfectly in how to
[1:37:43] accept all that Christ has already done
[1:37:45] for her at Calvary.
[1:37:47] I sent her the books, Do You Fear
[1:37:49] Cancer? From Brother Brandham and Christ
[1:37:50] the Healer by FF Bosworth. After
[1:37:54] testifying to her about the supernatural
[1:37:56] we've seen and instruct her in the
[1:37:58] scripture, Sister Debbie and I laid
[1:37:59] hands on her in prayer right in the
[1:38:01] furniture store showroom.
[1:38:04] Please agree with us for the Lord to
[1:38:05] spare her life as he reveals his word to
[1:38:07] her. She has already asked for our
[1:38:09] service link and has received a service
[1:38:12] from last Sunday. She's middle-aged and
[1:38:14] wants to live for her children and
[1:38:16] grandchildren.
[1:38:23] I believe that's all all we have.
[1:38:27] Who has a need here?
[1:38:31] I'm needy.
[1:38:39] Y'all lay hands on each other. Let's
[1:38:41] pray.
[1:38:43] Don't let me do the prayer and you all
[1:38:44] pray as well.
[1:38:47] Heavenly Father,
[1:38:49] Lord, we're glad that we have an
[1:38:51] attorney that stood for us that day.
[1:38:53] Lord,
[1:38:55] Lord, mercy walked in in our lives one
[1:38:57] day. Lord, when we were out in sin,
[1:39:01] you came through the door.
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; Father, your blood set us free, Father.
[1:39:06] Lord, how thankful we are for that,
[1:39:08] Lord. Lord, I I pray, Father, that you
[1:39:10] just help us, Lord, that we have to
[1:39:13] bring these bodies under subjection to
[1:39:16] the Holy Spirit. Father, we need to
[1:39:18] control our very being, Lord. That we
[1:39:20] control our tongue, our what we say and
[1:39:22] what we hear, what we listen to, and
[1:39:24] Lord, what we look at, Father, how we
[1:39:26] act, Father. Lord, we'll place our body
[1:39:29] in into your hands for that subjection,
[1:39:31] Lord. Father, you see this request for
[1:39:33] Brother Jason, Father, this lady dying
[1:39:36] of cancer, Lord. Lord, if you don't
[1:39:38] move, she's she'll be gone from us. But
[1:39:41] Lord, you heard a request. She wants to
[1:39:43] live for her children and grandchildren.
[1:39:45] Father, that's a good desire, Lord.
[1:39:48] Father, she's heard the heard the
[1:39:50] witness from her pastor. Father, Lord,
[1:39:53] if there's a seed of life down inside
[1:39:55] that soul, Lord, may that light strike
[1:39:56] that seed.
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; And Father, if it be your will, Lord,
[1:40:01] may the healing touch of Jehovah just go
[1:40:03] to this sister. Father, Lord, may there
[1:40:06] be a complete deliverance. May we even
[1:40:09] hear a testimony, Father, how that she
[1:40:11] is cancer free. Lord, every person here
[1:40:14] in this building that had their hands
[1:40:15] raised, Lord, you know their need behind
[1:40:18] their hand, Father. It don't matter what
[1:40:21] it is. No need is too great for you. You
[1:40:24] can move for it, Father. I pray, God,
[1:40:26] may you move it, Lord. Lord, be be with
[1:40:30] this service, Father. Lord, it's over.
[1:40:35] Father, I hope something was said that
[1:40:36] had been a blessing. Lord,

[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; Father, I pray Lord you be with our

[1:42:11] doctor's expectations.
[1:42:14] Sister Phyllis said, "I've had two
[1:42:16] special I have two special unspoken
[1:42:18] prayer requests and a prayer request for
[1:42:20] my sister Susie as they have recommended
[1:42:22] four rounds of chemo as part of her
[1:42:25] treatment. Her first treatment is to
[1:42:27] start next week and she's very scared by
[1:42:29] all of the all it entails. Thank you.
[1:42:34] Let's pray for these requests.
[1:42:38] Heavenly Father, Lord, you see Brother
[1:42:39] Luther's need, Lord.
[1:42:42] Lord, I can sympathize my brother having
[1:42:44] shoulder pain for I've had it myself,
[1:42:45] Father.
[1:42:47] Lord, it hinders you from being able to
[1:42:49] do some kind of work, Lord. But I pray,
[1:42:51] Father, may you heal my brother, Father.
[1:42:54] Even as we stand right now, may you just
[1:42:56] heal him, Lord. Father, Sister Meredith,
[1:42:58] this request for this man named Kevin.
[1:43:00] Father,
[1:43:02] open heart surgery.
[1:43:04] Lord, we serve the great physician.
[1:43:07] You're the great surgeon, Father. Lord,
[1:43:10] I just pray, Lord, may you guide the
[1:43:11] surgeon's hand, Lord.
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; Her request was, may it meet the
[1:43:16] expectations beyond that of the doctors,
[1:43:18] Lord. Father, we pray for Sister
[1:43:20] Phyllis, her unspoken request, Lord. You
[1:43:23] know what they are, Father. May you move
[1:43:26] there according to your will. Lord, our
[1:43:28] sister Susie fix to go through chemo.
[1:43:32] Father's nervous about it, Lord. But I
[1:43:34] pray, Father, may your spirit just go
[1:43:36] with her, Father. May you give her the
[1:43:38] comfort she needs, Lord.
[1:43:41] Father, I just pray, Father, that you
[1:43:43] just move for her, Father.
[1:43:45] In Jesus name we pray. Amen.
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; Sing again. Mercy for God.

[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; Has anybody got a testimony?
[1:45:41] [Music]
[1:45:45] So, I drove to Alabama on I don't know,
[1:45:49] Friday or I don't know, Monday
[1:45:52] and then um drove back yesterday just to
[1:45:55] see my sister-in-law and her kids
[1:45:56] because they were there. So, it was a
[1:45:58] five-hour drive and I took off in the
[1:46:00] morning. Um,
[1:46:03] and got on like the wrong exit with the
[1:46:06] map somehow and I got stuck in traffic
[1:46:08] like a wreck. I was on the wrong road at
[1:46:11] like 30 minute delay and it was really
[1:46:13] annoying. And then I got to and then I
[1:46:15] got some texts from her like she didn't
[1:46:17] feel good or and I was like maybe she
[1:46:20] didn't really want me to come but that
[1:46:21] wasn't what anyway I called her. We kind
[1:46:23] of like figured out what the text was,
[1:46:25] but then I had like such a weird feeling
[1:46:27] because I was already like I was only
[1:46:29] like a little bit out of Pooler and I'm
[1:46:32] like, should I just go home? I don't
[1:46:33] know. I I really felt weird about just
[1:46:36] going and I was delayed already so much,
[1:46:39] but I couldn't get a hold of Steve. I'm
[1:46:42] like, I wanted him to say, "Yeah, just
[1:46:43] come home." And my sister-in-law was
[1:46:45] like, "No, it's up to you. Like, we want
[1:46:46] you." Anyway, it was like a lot of back
[1:46:48] and forth and I can't I could not make a
[1:46:51] decision. So, I just stopped and prayed
[1:46:54] and still, you know, I'm like, I don't
[1:46:57] know if I should go or like turn around
[1:46:59] and go home. I couldn't get like a clear
[1:47:01] answer. So, when I stopped praying, I
[1:47:03] just put the address into where she was
[1:47:05] and I I took off to her where she was.
[1:47:10] And I get down the road and the map like
[1:47:13] probably like 40 minutes and there's
[1:47:15] like it's raining but the map keeps
[1:47:18] saying visibility poor visibility. Is it
[1:47:21] still like like that? And it wasn't. It
[1:47:24] was nice. And so I just thought that was
[1:47:26] interesting. I kept probably three times
[1:47:28] it was saying low visibility. Is it
[1:47:30] still there? And sure enough, like there
[1:47:32] was a road, a car like way off in the
[1:47:34] ditch. And it was there were spots where
[1:47:36] it was low visibility just like a couple
[1:47:39] times. And I've never driven in that.
[1:47:41] That's really scary. You can see
[1:47:43] nothing. It's like a white out
[1:47:44] snowstorm. That's the only thing I've
[1:47:46] ever experienced like that.
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; But um I just know God protected me and
[1:47:50] it was I definitely feel like it was his
[1:47:52] will for me to go visit with her. It was
[1:47:54] a productive, you know, visit. But um
[1:47:58] anyway, I just want to thank God for
[1:47:59] protecting me and delaying me.
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:48:05] He He watches out for us.
[1:48:08] Anybody else?
[1:48:11] [Music]
[1:48:17] Let's shake hands. And as we sing it one
[1:48:19] more time, you can be dismissed. We
