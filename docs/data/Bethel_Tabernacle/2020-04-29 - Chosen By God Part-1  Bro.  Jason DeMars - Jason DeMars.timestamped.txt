[35:55] Jesus Lord would you just grant Lord

[36:14] right before you and Lord let me get out
[36:21] of the way but each one of us get out of
[36:24] the way Lord but the Holy Spirit would
[36:26] flow words that would be spoken Lord
[36:30] would not be my words my thoughts Lord
[36:32] but they would be your words and your
[36:34] thoughts we love you Lord we ask that
[36:38] you would have your way we give
[36:40] ourselves to you we ask in Jesus
[36:42] precious name Amen and God bless you all
[36:49] okay excuse me all right so I'm gonna
[36:54] start a series today called chosen by
[36:58] God and we are going to go through the
[37:04] the scriptures tonight and some quotes
[37:08] going to talk about the sovereignty of
[37:10] God we're going to talk about the
[37:13] freedom of the will we're going to talk
[37:15] about the bondage of the will if we get
[37:19] to it see how it goes
[37:22] with that sad musicians if you can you
[37:25] can you can go ahead it'll be a minute
[37:27] before I get to the scripture so thank
[37:31] you so much
[37:34] so the the the scriptural doctrine of
[37:38] election is actually the only way that
[37:44] we can rightly understand the gospel the
[37:47] grace of God and the application of the
[37:50] original sin you know it's it's through
[37:54] a true revelation of that that we can
[37:57] understand that if you if you're not
[37:59] seeing election in the scripture you're
[38:03] actually not really seeing the gospel
[38:04] you're seeing a false gospel based upon
[38:11] you're seeing a false gospel based upon
[38:14] human will human effort if it's if our
[38:18] salvation is up to us our choosing our
[38:23] purposes we will fail we will come up
[38:28] short
[38:29] salvation is completely of the Lord it's
[38:34] not it's not from us it's not from our
[38:37] choosing
[38:37] it's not from our purpose it's his
[38:40] purpose his plan his word his work and
[38:43] if you have you have our salvation based
[38:47] upon us our will our effort now you get
[38:52] to the place where you're actually doing
[38:55] your despising the grace of God and
[38:58] you're saying now that there's a human
[39:01] effort that can bring salvation that
[39:05] contradicts the very meaning of the word
[39:09] salvation we need a Savior we can't save
[39:13] ourselves we can't put forth an effort
[39:16] or a choice that would bring us to this
[39:18] position or place where okay now you're
[39:21] worthy of salvation we are not worthy
[39:24] and I'm getting ahead of myself but I
[39:27] just trying to plant the seed and kind
[39:30] of give you an overview of things so
[39:33] understanding election and
[39:35] predestination the sovereignty of God
[39:38] that's the truth that gives confidence
[39:41] to gospel preaching without having an
[39:45] understanding of God
[39:46] sovereignty in salvation you're telling
[39:50] me that we're to go forth to be
[39:52] evangelists and missionaries and by our
[39:55] abilities bring people to salvation
[39:59] it'll never happen it is God
[40:05] it is God sending it is God speaking
[40:07] it's God anointing it's God calling it's
[40:10] God from start to finish we need a
[40:15] god-centered gospel not a man-centered
[40:18] gospel God is the center of the gospel
[40:21] and he brings it to us through Jesus
[40:25] Christ and his purpose his blood it's
[40:28] all of him how can we how can we move
[40:33] forward when the reality is that it's
[40:38] based on our choosing it's based on
[40:41] whether we stand whether we continue
[40:44] whether we achieve something it's not
[40:50] gonna work so ultimately the sovereignty
[40:57] of God
[40:57] thank you brother Brad who is in who is
[41:01] in charge of the universe we speak about
[41:04] free will okay we have free will
[41:08] absolutely no argument there but who's
[41:13] in charge of the universe you and I or
[41:16] is God in charge of the universe is our
[41:20] purpose going to stand or is God's
[41:22] purpose going to stand or perhaps Satan
[41:26] has somewhere in there you know there at
[41:28] the college that I went to there was a
[41:32] professor he was also a pastor named
[41:35] Greg Boyd and he believed in something
[41:37] called open theism you everybody that
[41:40] wants to take their seats feel free I'm
[41:42] just I'm just getting an introduction
[41:45] we'll get to that probably do a quote
[41:47] before I get to the scripture so so this
[41:54] professor I had in college named Greg
[41:57] Boyd he he was teaching this I D
[42:00] of open theism and that's that God knows
[42:03] all the possibilities of what could
[42:06] happen but he doesn't know with
[42:09] precision what exactly will happen
[42:11] because we have free will and we can
[42:14] impact on what would happen there and we
[42:19] had many conversations me and people in
[42:22] my in in the college about this and all
[42:25] of us you know it's it's a harsh thing
[42:27] to say but all of us many of us came to
[42:30] the conclusion that this is simply
[42:32] beyond the pale outright heresy
[42:35] and absolutely it is it's it's literally
[42:39] changing the nature of God and it's
[42:43] completely wrong that's way out of
[42:45] balance but then there's this there's
[42:47] this idea that you see today now
[42:49] traditional Arminianism so Jacobus
[42:52] Arminius was a reformer his viewpoint
[42:55] was different than almost every other
[42:57] reformer but his idea was yes God
[43:00] chooses us but that choice is only based
[43:03] upon for knowing our choice has nothing
[43:06] to do with the sovereignty of God it has
[43:08] to do with him knowing all possible not
[43:11] all possibilities knowing everything
[43:13] that will happen but he only only knows
[43:18] what choice will make and that's how he
[43:21] predestinated Ott's arminianism and then
[43:25] there's Calvinism Calvinism is that God
[43:29] chooses God calls God is completely
[43:32] sovereign over the whole process from
[43:34] start to finish and there's all kinds
[43:37] brother Branham talks about Calvinism
[43:40] being out of balance now you know
[43:43] there's he also says I'm a Calvinist so
[43:46] there is types of Calvinism you'll call
[43:50] it hyper cals
[43:51] Calvin Calvinism or you call it extreme
[43:53] Calvinism it's things that Charles
[43:56] Spurgeon was preaching against it was
[43:58] like you didn't have to preach the
[44:00] gospel you didn't have to have a burden
[44:01] for lost souls you didn't have to go out
[44:03] and do missions God was simply going to
[44:05] save those he chose to save and the rest
[44:09] of it was not necessary again that
[44:11] that's completely out of balance
[44:14] is a scriptural balance to understanding
[44:16] these things and approaching these
[44:17] things it's not in open theism it's not
[44:21] in arminianism it's not in pure
[44:23] Calvinism but it's in a scriptural truth
[44:27] and the fact is the message gives us
[44:29] something even further beyond those
[44:31] things that they never really saw or
[44:34] understood that gives us the ballot the
[44:37] proper balance in those things so the
[44:41] ultimate authority in the world who is
[44:43] it man our will our purpose or is it God
[44:48] can we change the plan and purpose of
[44:52] God ultimately we cannot nothing you can
[44:56] do nothing that the devil can do nothing
[45:00] that any person on this planet could do
[45:03] could change God's purpose so first
[45:09] thing I want to start with in this is
[45:12] that God has sovereignly decreed
[45:15] everything that has happened and that
[45:18] will happen nothing is outside of his
[45:20] control and nothing catches him off
[45:22] guard
[45:23] he planned each and everything that way
[45:28] it as we understand some of these
[45:30] mysteries that are revealed even in
[45:33] marriage and divorce
[45:34] God created within his creation certain
[45:42] abilities or lack of abilities so that
[45:45] when they made their choice it brought
[45:48] about a fall you know he made Eve as a
[45:52] by-product he made her in a certain and
[45:54] specific way so that when she was
[45:57] approached she could fall why because
[46:01] God is a savior God God is love how do
[46:04] you know what God is you have to have
[46:06] both sides of the coin so to speak if
[46:09] you don't know God's wrath you don't
[46:12] know the meaning of God's love and mercy
[46:14] you have to have those opposing they're
[46:18] not opposing attributes but two sides of
[46:22] the attributes love and judgment
[46:26] you know mercy and judgment love and
[46:29] wrath both of those things
[46:31] magnify who God is you have God's wisdom
[46:35] you have all these attributes of God and
[46:40] they need he needs to express himself
[46:42] he's it's in him to be a savior so there
[46:45] has something he's fallen that he can
[46:47] save etc this was God's purpose this was
[46:51] God's plan when did God plan it let's
[46:56] bring up that quote brother George from
[46:58] things that are to be says your birth
[47:08] was premier was pre-planned I guess you
[47:11] believe that every one of you knows that
[47:14] our birth was pre-planned did you know
[47:16] that your being here never originated
[47:17] just as at a myth or a thought look at
[47:21] this everything how many things
[47:25] everything was all pre-planned by God
[47:28] before the foundation of the world that
[47:31] you would be here so in other words God
[47:34] had orchestrated everything all along
[47:37] the way so that you that those people
[47:40] that were sitting there listening to
[47:41] brother Branham preached things that are
[47:42] to be would be there
[47:44] I mean think of the millions of chance
[47:47] happenings that took place for that to
[47:50] get to that place not only those people
[47:52] but all the people in in the in history
[47:55] who was the parents the grandparents the
[47:58] all the way back I mean all of the
[48:01] things that had to happen the choices
[48:03] the decisions that they had to make
[48:05] people were others other side of the
[48:07] planet and all of a sudden they're like
[48:08] I'm gonna go to America I mean you think
[48:11] about how God orchestrated all of those
[48:14] things it's absolutely incredible
[48:17] we're gonna bring up our first scripture
[48:19] now psalm 115 verse 3
[48:27] but our God is in the heavens he's done
[48:29] whatsoever he is pleased let's look at
[48:33] that verse here he's done whatever he
[48:37] pleases so in what does he do what he
[48:40] pleases everything so nothing thoughts
[48:47] the plan and purpose of God nothing
[48:50] comes against it he does what he desires
[48:53] to do and what we desire to do and what
[48:57] what we purpose never changes the fact
[49:00] that God does what he pleases the next
[49:03] verse is Psalm 33 verse 11 the counsel
[49:08] of the Lord stands forever the thoughts
[49:11] of his heart to all generation the word
[49:14] counsel there means advice and it were
[49:18] it speaks of his plan so his plan his
[49:23] purpose stands for how long forever
[49:30] every generation from the first
[49:32] generation all the way to the very last
[49:34] one from Genesis 1:1 to revelation 20:2
[49:39] all of God's purposes and counsels
[49:41] plants stand it stands doesn't waver it
[49:46] doesn't change it doesn't well well they
[49:49] did this so I got to change my idea over
[49:51] here and they did over here know his
[49:53] counsel his purpose his plan stands it's
[49:57] unchangeable Isaiah 46 verse 10
[50:15] declaring the end from the beginning and
[50:17] from ancient times the things that are
[50:19] not yet done saying my counsel shall
[50:22] stand and I will do all my pleasure so
[50:29] he declared he does he just know what's
[50:31] gonna happen
[50:31] no declaring the end from the beginning
[50:35] when when you make a declaration you're
[50:38] saying this is what's happening this is
[50:40] what's happening this is what's
[50:41] happening so he comes what we're seeing
[50:45] today in our world this should give us
[50:47] joy this said this should make us
[50:51] rejoice because what's happening in our
[50:55] world today it seems scary it seems
[50:57] fearful it's not not for a believer now
[51:00] for the world they're losing their mind
[51:02] they're absolutely losing their mind you
[51:07] know I think about imagine the real
[51:09] plague coming upon the earth what I mean
[51:13] people are literally driving down the
[51:15] freeway in their own car by themselves
[51:17] with a mask on and it's not just one
[51:27] person it's a lot of people are doing it
[51:29] you see the fear the irrationality of
[51:32] fear and even you just think just just
[51:35] think for a minute if you have a mask on
[51:38] and you're going all over these places
[51:40] and you never wash it and you keep
[51:42] putting it on what is it doing for you
[51:44] okay getting off the point but I'm
[51:47] saying this is a this is this is the
[51:49] irrationality and insanity of fear in
[51:54] our day and age imagine when a real
[51:57] plague comes and as you see that
[51:59] statistics are coming out and scientists
[52:02] are looking at this and they're
[52:03] comparing what's really happening to the
[52:05] models and it's way different than what
[52:07] they projected and and they made their
[52:09] decisions they the politicians made
[52:12] their decisions on fear and the people
[52:15] of the world are living in fear just
[52:17] imagine when there's really a reason to
[52:19] be afraid it's gonna be on we're gonna
[52:24] be gone praise the Lord
[52:26] we'll be out of here but the council of
[52:29] the Lord will stay his plan will stand
[52:31] once again it's gonna stand something
[52:34] that stands as stalwart it's not laying
[52:38] down it's not withering it's standing
[52:41] and everything is beating against it
[52:44] Satan is beating against it and it's
[52:46] just standing nothing is changing he
[52:49] will do all his pleasure Wow you know
[52:56] this thing you see that a couple of
[52:58] different times God speaking of doing
[53:00] his pleasure we think we don't when we
[53:04] think of God we don't think of him
[53:07] having pleasure but but it's something
[53:10] that God reads he rejoices in himself
[53:12] think about that for a second he
[53:15] rejoices in his sovereignty he rejoices
[53:18] in the plan that he has that he's
[53:21] accomplishing in the earth if he's hath
[53:25] takes pleasure in it should we we should
[53:28] take pleasure in it let's go to that
[53:30] next verse in Daniel chapter 5 verse 21
[53:37] and he was driven from the sons of man
[53:39] that's speaking of Nebuchadnezzar and
[53:40] his heart was made like the beasts and
[53:42] his dwelling was with the wild asses
[53:44] they fed him with grass like oxen and
[53:46] his body was wet with the dew of heaven
[53:48] till he knew listen till he knew that
[53:53] the Most High God ruled in the kingdom
[53:55] of men and that he appointed over it
[53:58] whomsoever he will sow Nebuchadnezzar is
[54:02] thinking look at the grandeur of my
[54:04] kingdom look at how great what I've
[54:06] accomplished God says all right
[54:08] that's what you think you're gonna be an
[54:10] ox and you're gonna you're gonna have
[54:14] long nails and long hair and you're
[54:17] literally gonna lose your mind and
[54:18] you're gonna be chewing on chewing grass
[54:20] like a cow that's that's the sovereignty
[54:26] of God he says okay mr. King here's some
[54:31] grass to chew on for a while and it's
[54:33] gonna it's gonna go on until until you
[54:37] know that the most high till you
[54:40] confess with your mouth that the Most
[54:43] High God rules the kingdom of men and
[54:46] that he appoints over it whomsoever he
[54:49] will now
[54:51] don't fear brother Branham says don't
[54:53] fear communism that's what we see it
[54:55] today all over social media right-wing
[54:58] people conservative people they're
[54:59] afraid of communism coming over this
[55:02] country don't fear communism
[55:05] it's Romanism that's gonna rule the
[55:07] world don't get your eyes out under the
[55:10] wrong kind of thing you know it's not
[55:13] gonna be Bill Gates that rules the world
[55:14] it's gonna be the Pope the people our
[55:18] people are afraid of these things
[55:20] there's not not a reason to be afraid
[55:22] God appoints over the world whom he
[55:25] wants to rule he wanted President Trump
[55:28] to be the president right now because he
[55:30] knew how he would react and respond and
[55:32] he knew what kind of person that he was
[55:34] and all the leaders of the earth that's
[55:37] the case all the people that are wealthy
[55:40] and rich you know we there's all these
[55:44] conspiracy thoughts and you know the 1%
[55:47] is controlling this the devil is the one
[55:50] that's controlling the whole thing and
[55:53] he'd uh he he moves this one here moves
[55:55] this one here and guess what God is
[55:59] control of it all and he is going to
[56:02] accomplish his purpose and nothing's no
[56:05] one is gonna for that no one's gonna
[56:07] stop that there's there's not a reason
[56:10] for us to be afraid in this hour unless
[56:13] we're listening to the wrong voice God
[56:17] is sovereign over you God is sovereign
[56:21] over your life everything that comes
[56:24] across your way I love brother Charles
[56:27] remember when we met brothers he said
[56:30] whatever happens to me if I if if I die
[56:32] I'm ready to go home but I believe the
[56:36] Lord can can keep me and protect me and
[56:38] that's the that's the attitude that's
[56:41] the heart to have and God is keeping him
[56:43] through through a great difficulty and
[56:45] we believe will be back amongst us and
[56:48] when we're all together we'll be
[56:50] rejoicing over what the Lord has done
[56:51] for him
[56:52] amen next scripture is in Jonah chapter
[56:56] 2 verse 9 but I will sacrifice unto thee
[57:00] with the voice of Thanksgiving I will
[57:02] pay that that I have vowed salvation is
[57:07] of the Lord
[57:08] Jonah knew that pretty well he was in a
[57:12] dark place a stinky place a difficult
[57:17] place and he learned that when he turned
[57:20] to the Lord and he prayed God brought
[57:22] him deliverance for him I mean you're
[57:25] out in the middle of the Mediterranean
[57:25] Sea and there's a huge storm and you get
[57:28] thrown into the water you pretty much
[57:30] know that your time has come and you
[57:34] know we look at God saved him God saved
[57:38] him and brought forth a testimony in him
[57:40] that would speak to the ones that he was
[57:41] supposed to speak to and so God was
[57:44] completely sovereign over Jonah's
[57:47] harebrained decision because what would
[57:55] if he just went directly there what kind
[57:57] of testimony would it have been so he it
[58:01] was a mistake he should have listened
[58:02] right away but God knew he was not going
[58:05] to do that he knew what kind of man
[58:07] Jonah was he knew that he was going to
[58:09] run and he he said alright I'm gonna
[58:12] have a storm waiting for him and I'm
[58:13] gonna make a fish to swallow him and
[58:16] spit him out on the land now he's gonna
[58:19] have a testimony and do you have a
[58:22] testimony did you go through something
[58:25] that was awful and God brought you
[58:27] through salvation is of the Lord isn't
[58:31] it next scripture Isaiah 45 verse 7 i
[58:40] form the light and create darkness i
[58:43] make peace and create evil
[58:47] I the LORD do all these things our
[58:51] philosophy class did not like this verse
[58:54] in college
[58:57] but if you really look at the verse it's
[59:00] create evil you know we understand evil
[59:04] is not not it's a perversion of that
[59:08] which is right you know it's taking
[59:10] what's right and turning it on its head
[59:13] it's not a thing and of itself it's the
[59:16] absence of goodness it's the absence of
[59:20] righteousness and so you know if you
[59:24] look at this vert this word evil it can
[59:26] also mean calamity you know and so God
[59:29] God is is not the author of confusion
[59:33] right God is not the author of evil and
[59:38] yet we have here he says he created evil
[59:40] so how did he create evil he allowed
[59:43] evil to have its way to have its fruit
[59:48] why in order to accomplish a greater
[59:51] purpose
[59:52] you know God God didn't say okay I'm
[59:55] gonna make this one evil no that they
[59:58] all those people that made an evil
[1:00:01] choice they said I will what was
[1:00:03] Lucifer's choice I will
[1:00:06] so he made Lucifer chose and yet God
[1:00:10] ordained that Lucifer would have it
[1:00:13] within him the capability to make that
[1:00:16] choice to turn against him and tried to
[1:00:18] exalt himself Romans chapter 9 verse 18
[1:00:25] through 21 will read therefore hath he
[1:00:29] mercy on whom he will have mercy and
[1:00:31] whom he will he hardeneth verse 19 next
[1:00:39] one that's it now say that unto me why
[1:00:44] doth he yet find fault for who hath
[1:00:46] resisted his will
[1:00:48] nay but o man who art thou that repliest
[1:00:50] against God shall the thing formed say
[1:00:52] to him that formed it why hast thou made
[1:00:54] me thus hath not the Potter power over
[1:00:57] the clay of the same lump to make one
[1:00:59] vessel unto honour and another unto
[1:01:01] dishonour so it was God's plan God's
[1:01:06] purpose God's choosing he made them with
[1:01:09] the
[1:01:10] but they still had to choose and I think
[1:01:12] that's where we're going to next freedom
[1:01:14] of the will if God is sovereign over
[1:01:17] everything
[1:01:18] if God's purpose will stand regardless
[1:01:20] doesn't that mean that we now do not
[1:01:23] have free will let's look at it this way
[1:01:27] those who reject God do so voluntarily
[1:01:33] they are not forced to come to him to
[1:01:37] have life they choose not to have life
[1:01:40] you say but God made them this way yes
[1:01:43] that's true but he makes the offer
[1:01:46] remember Cain Cain was the serpent seed
[1:01:51] and God offered salvation to him and he
[1:01:56] got angry he hated it he despised God
[1:01:59] and so in thing and bring that quote up
[1:02:03] from things that are to be there if you
[1:02:07] can you're on free moral agency you can
[1:02:13] act next one I think yeah you're on free
[1:02:18] moral agency you can act the way you
[1:02:20] wish to amen so so simple what is free
[1:02:26] will if you were if you are a
[1:02:28] philosopher and took philosophy class
[1:02:31] you would understand the depth of the
[1:02:34] wisdom of the statement that brother
[1:02:35] Branham just made that's what free will
[1:02:37] is you act you do what you desire to do
[1:02:41] you act the way you want to act and it's
[1:02:45] not forced upon you and that's not just
[1:02:48] saying that
[1:02:50] well you said God sovereign and now
[1:02:51] you're saying he doesn't force his will
[1:02:53] upon you well let's continue John let's
[1:02:56] go to the scripture back to the
[1:02:57] scripture John chapter five verse 40
[1:03:01] we're keeping you active brother George
[1:03:03] god bless you thank you on the new
[1:03:06] program you're running back and forth
[1:03:09] it's a it's a good training praise the
[1:03:10] Lord
[1:03:12] John 5 verse 40 and he and you will not
[1:03:16] come to me that you might have life you
[1:03:18] will not come to me your will is that
[1:03:22] you don't want to come to me your desire
[1:03:25] your desire your purpose is that you
[1:03:28] want to reject Christ that's what they
[1:03:31] want no one forces them to reject Christ
[1:03:34] that's their choice that's the decision
[1:03:37] that they want to make revelation 22
[1:03:40] verse 17 in the spirit and the bride say
[1:03:45] come
[1:03:46] and let him that heareth say come and
[1:03:47] let him that is athirst come and
[1:03:50] whosoever will let him take the water of
[1:03:52] life freely it's open whoever wants to
[1:03:59] come come on hey anybody wants to
[1:04:03] receive salvation come on and receive it
[1:04:05] and then they throw it then the stones
[1:04:08] come the rotten tomatos we don't need we
[1:04:13] don't what do you mean we need a Savior
[1:04:14] who do you think you are to tell us that
[1:04:16] all are welcome to come there's not a
[1:04:19] there's not with now let's just look at
[1:04:22] this the comparison okay we have the
[1:04:24] sovereignty of God and we have the free
[1:04:27] will of man and in philosophy they
[1:04:30] always want to pit these 2 things
[1:04:31] against each other to fight against each
[1:04:33] other but that's the human perspective
[1:04:36] that's coming from perspective of a
[1:04:39] person that's limited by time and space
[1:04:43] and only understands time in a linear
[1:04:46] fashion and that's a mistake there is
[1:04:49] not with man as there is with God a past
[1:04:52] he is bound by we're bound by things
[1:04:55] that happened to us in the past choices
[1:04:58] that our parents made not that there's
[1:05:02] forgiveness there's salvation there's
[1:05:04] transformation and yet if you commit
[1:05:06] adultery and have a child there's not
[1:05:08] there's not a reversal of that that
[1:05:12] continues on that follows you along we
[1:05:16] can be forgiven but the consequences
[1:05:18] still follow you follow you there's a
[1:05:21] past that we are bound by God is not
[1:05:24] in time and not limited by time he's not
[1:05:27] bound by the past everything is now with
[1:05:31] God now a 2000 years ago a thousand
[1:05:36] years from now that's all the same with
[1:05:39] God because he's outside of the time and
[1:05:42] space dimensions so that with God the
[1:05:47] past is never past and the future is
[1:05:51] ever present
[1:05:53] so the unchangeableness of God's
[1:05:55] sovereign decrees is not in disunity
[1:05:59] with his ability to answer our prayers
[1:06:01] and for us to make choices they don't
[1:06:05] contradict each other one dimension is
[1:06:08] one is outside of this dimension one is
[1:06:11] in this dimension from the perspective
[1:06:13] of a linear amount of time we say I have
[1:06:17] to make choices and that means that God
[1:06:18] is limited by my choices but outside of
[1:06:22] time God's gone don't you get it yet
[1:06:27] yeah the scripture puts our free will he
[1:06:31] says it says whoever whosoever will the
[1:06:33] scripture also says God does whatever he
[1:06:35] pleases and no one can change his plan
[1:06:38] and purpose and decree so are we
[1:06:41] supposed to make those fight each other
[1:06:42] are we supposed to say yes amen
[1:06:46] that's beautiful yes I can choose yes he
[1:06:50] is completely sovereign yes he's in
[1:06:52] control of everything how how can we
[1:06:55] really trust God if he's not sovereign
[1:06:59] over everything we there's no there's no
[1:07:01] way we can if it's bait everything is
[1:07:04] based on the will of man it just makes
[1:07:09] my head explode to think that somebody a
[1:07:12] Christian that confesses to believe this
[1:07:15] Bible would say that I mean you see
[1:07:18] people today they're there they're in
[1:07:22] Minnesota we got Baptists but they're
[1:07:24] they believe in predestination down here
[1:07:26] we got Baptists they don't believe in
[1:07:27] predestination I had so many
[1:07:30] conversations with people in my college
[1:07:33] and they said I don't believe in
[1:07:36] predestination I said you're not a
[1:07:37] Christian
[1:07:39] and they're like yes I am I
[1:07:42] and I I said no you if you're a
[1:07:46] Christian you believe every word in the
[1:07:48] Bible you trust God you're saying I
[1:07:52] don't believe God and I don't believe
[1:07:54] the Bible although I believe it
[1:07:56] it says predestination were
[1:07:58] predestinated it said we're chosen by
[1:08:01] God in Christ before the foundation of
[1:08:03] the world and you said you don't believe
[1:08:05] that well I mean I don't know what to
[1:08:11] say but I don't I believe that we have a
[1:08:13] choice and we have to choose him every
[1:08:15] day okay Wow your salvation is based on
[1:08:20] something as fickle as you and I and I
[1:08:25] truly believe that someone that comes to
[1:08:27] me and says I don't believe in
[1:08:29] predestination I just have to say you're
[1:08:32] not we can't even have a discussion we
[1:08:34] don't we have to taught approach you as
[1:08:35] an unbeliever as an infidel because you
[1:08:38] don't even believe in the basic
[1:08:41] literally a word in the Bible I remember
[1:08:44] when my I didn't know anything I mean I
[1:08:46] grew up in a Lutheran Church I didn't
[1:08:48] hardly know anything and these Calvinist
[1:08:51] fellows are talking to me and said hey
[1:08:53] do you believe in predestination
[1:08:54] meanwhile I'm swearing and drinking and
[1:08:58] just was in an awful condition in my
[1:09:00] life but they said do you believe in
[1:09:01] predestination I said what does that
[1:09:03] mean so they open the Bible and read it
[1:09:05] I said well it's in the Bible so yes I
[1:09:07] believe it that's the proper response
[1:09:12] you might not understand it but if it's
[1:09:15] in the Bible you can't say it and you
[1:09:17] are a Christian or a believer or
[1:09:19] confessed to believe you can't say no I
[1:09:22] don't believe it that's nonsense
[1:09:25] you hear repent this is what you need to
[1:09:27] do and come to God and get saved I mean
[1:09:35] look at okay let's go to John 3:16
[1:09:41] we know the verse for God so loved the
[1:09:44] world that He gave His only begotten Son
[1:09:45] that whosoever believeth in him should
[1:09:50] not perish but have everlasting life
[1:09:53] whosoever believes anyone that believes
[1:09:57] anyone that chooses to follow Christ can
[1:10:00] receive eternal life through him anyone
[1:10:04] anyone that desires let's look at acts
[1:10:08] 13 verse 48 still pulling it up brother
[1:10:21] George
[1:10:22] alright I'm gonna do it the
[1:10:25] old-fashioned way there you got it
[1:10:29] and then when the Gentiles heard this
[1:10:32] they were glad and glorified the word of
[1:10:34] the Lord and look at that and as many as
[1:10:36] were ordained to eternal life believed
[1:10:40] so who is it whosoever believes who is
[1:10:44] it whosoever is those that were ordained
[1:10:46] to eternal life now this this brings us
[1:10:51] to the place where we understand we do
[1:10:54] we choose but let's go a little further
[1:10:59] and ask this question can we choose does
[1:11:06] the Bible say you can you're you have
[1:11:09] the ability to choose God now it said it
[1:11:13] makes the offering says believe
[1:11:15] whosoever will believe but let's look at
[1:11:19] Romans chapter 3 and there's quite a
[1:11:24] number of verses here so I'm just going
[1:11:26] to turn there and we're gonna look at
[1:11:29] verse enough starting at verse 9 and
[1:11:35] we're gonna go through 23 what then are
[1:11:42] we better than they know in no wise for
[1:11:46] you before proved both Jews and Gentiles
[1:11:49] that they are all under sin so this
[1:11:54] verse here
[1:11:55] as saying we we proved this previously
[1:11:57] so in chapter 1 verses 18 through the
[1:12:02] end he shows the life of Gentiles sold
[1:12:06] out to sin completely and then he goes
[1:12:09] into chapter 2 and he begins to point
[1:12:12] out that Jews consistently disobey the
[1:12:17] law of God even though they have the law
[1:12:19] they have the commandments they
[1:12:21] continually disobey God and now he's
[1:12:24] saying okay I've made my case I've
[1:12:27] stated my point and now we're gonna get
[1:12:29] into what does that actually mean in
[1:12:32] regards to the gospel of Jesus Christ
[1:12:35] our what then are we better than they
[1:12:37] know in nowise are we Christians are we
[1:12:40] better than they we've proved before
[1:12:42] Jews and Gentiles are all sinners all of
[1:12:47] them choose sin verse 10 as it is
[1:12:50] written there is runt none righteous no
[1:12:54] not one
[1:12:54] Wow so now he's really bringing that
[1:12:57] he's prosecuting us and button we're in
[1:13:01] trouble it's bringing out a lot of
[1:13:04] dangerous facts here there's none that
[1:13:08] understands Wow there's none that seeks
[1:13:13] after God there's none that seeks God
[1:13:17] they're all gone out of the way isn't
[1:13:20] there some exceptions to that
[1:13:23] well Paul doesn't make any they're all
[1:13:26] gone out of the way they're together
[1:13:27] become unprofitable there's none that
[1:13:30] doeth good no not one Wow not a single
[1:13:36] one their throat is an open Sepulchre
[1:13:42] ouch I mean think about what he's just
[1:13:44] saying there that Sepulchre sounds
[1:13:46] really nice it's very fancy but their
[1:13:51] throat is a grave he's literally saying
[1:13:55] there's the opening of a grave right
[1:14:00] that's that's your throat well what's at
[1:14:02] the bottom of a grave with their tongues
[1:14:06] they have used deceit
[1:14:08] the poison of ASPs is under their lips
[1:14:11] whose mouth is full of cursing and
[1:14:14] bitterness their feet are Swift to shed
[1:14:17] blood destruction and misery are in
[1:14:19] their ways and the way of peace have
[1:14:21] they not known there is no fear of God
[1:14:25] before their eyes now we know that what
[1:14:28] things soever the law saith it saith to
[1:14:30] them who are under the law that every
[1:14:33] mouth may be stopped in all the world
[1:14:35] how many all the world now if here's a
[1:14:39] little lesson all the world that's not
[1:14:42] just Jews that's everybody that's that's
[1:14:46] Gentiles that's you and I well that all
[1:14:55] the world may become guilty before God
[1:15:00] therefore by the deeds of the law there
[1:15:02] shall no flesh be justified in his sight
[1:15:05] for by the law is the knowledge of sin
[1:15:08] but now the righteousness of God without
[1:15:11] the law is manifested being witnessed by
[1:15:14] the law and the prophets even the
[1:15:15] righteousness of God which is by faith
[1:15:17] of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all
[1:15:20] them that believe for there is no
[1:15:22] difference for all have sinned and come
[1:15:25] short of the glory of God a couple
[1:15:28] points that I really want to emphasize
[1:15:29] from there is there is none that seeks
[1:15:34] after God I think about that for a
[1:15:40] second God offers himself freely and he
[1:15:44] says I have salvation for you I have
[1:15:48] freedom for you I have complete
[1:15:52] forgiveness for you I've got a new life
[1:15:54] for you
[1:15:55] I've got eternity for you and what what
[1:15:59] does man and his own devices do does you
[1:16:04] say oh it's amazing I accept it that's
[1:16:08] not the picture that Paul is painting
[1:16:10] there he's saying there's no one that
[1:16:13] seeks God there's no one that
[1:16:15] understands they're all gone out of the
[1:16:18] way
[1:16:19] so we
[1:16:21] in our own will do not choose him our
[1:16:26] will is actually in bondage to sin let's
[1:16:30] bring up that quote from you must be
[1:16:32] born again brother Jorge he says first
[1:16:39] we reckon ourselves sinners and worthy
[1:16:41] of condemnation and we are all born in
[1:16:44] sin and shaped in iniquity there's not a
[1:16:46] sound parcel of us our minds are bad our
[1:16:49] soul is corruptible our constant
[1:16:52] thinking is evil every imaginary thought
[1:16:55] of a man's mind is evil a sinner and
[1:16:57] also that our body is weak our spirit is
[1:17:00] no good and we're just full of
[1:17:02] corruption and how could one corruptible
[1:17:05] thing bring another good thing out of a
[1:17:07] corruptible let me say this that in job
[1:17:08] 14th chapter he said seeing that man is
[1:17:11] born of a woman is full of sorrow and
[1:17:13] trouble yet he cometh forth like a
[1:17:15] flower he fadeth away and on as the
[1:17:17] prophet goes on speaking he said who can
[1:17:19] bring a clean thing out of an unclean
[1:17:21] not one you stick your bucket down to
[1:17:24] the well and pull out a bucket of water
[1:17:25] and it's stagnant it stinks you look at
[1:17:28] it and it's muddy and little worms is in
[1:17:30] that water there's no way at all to put
[1:17:31] your bucket back and get a clean bucket
[1:17:33] the whole well is contaminated and in
[1:17:35] the whole soul mind and body of man is
[1:17:38] contaminated with sin and born and send
[1:17:42] physically shaped in iniquity and come
[1:17:44] to the world speaking lies so that his
[1:17:46] own soul is contaminated nothing good
[1:17:49] when out can't one cannot redeem the
[1:17:51] other because it's all wrong and you
[1:17:53] can't take a bucket full of water here
[1:17:54] that's contaminated another buff
[1:17:55] bucketful that's contaminated and mixed
[1:17:58] them together you've got more
[1:17:59] contamination no purification to it wow
[1:18:05] we're completely sold out of us out to
[1:18:08] sin he says body soul and spirit the
[1:18:11] whole thing is sold out to sin and then
[1:18:16] in the sermon sermon Jehovah Jireh the
[1:18:19] next quote there they probably he was a
[1:18:22] farmer lived in the valley of Shinar
[1:18:23] there and lived an ordinary life he
[1:18:26] probably went out in the daytime and got
[1:18:27] his meat from the bush and picked
[1:18:29] berries and lived that sort of a life
[1:18:30] just an ordinary man
[1:18:32] there was nothing special about him but
[1:18:34] one day God called him that's what made
[1:18:37] the difference when God made the call
[1:18:38] and that's the way it is to any life it
[1:18:40] takes God it isn't what you do it's what
[1:18:43] God does see you say I saw God I saw God
[1:18:46] you're mistaken no man seeks God God
[1:18:52] seeks the man
[1:18:53] see it's not you seeking God it's God
[1:18:55] seeking you jesus said you haven't
[1:18:58] chosen me but I chose you see so your
[1:19:00] your chose before the foundation of the
[1:19:02] world or you wasn't chose at all you
[1:19:04] just come to redeem that name and all
[1:19:06] those names are not on the Lamb's Book
[1:19:08] of Life before the foundation of the
[1:19:09] world is the only ones going to be there
[1:19:11] anyhow see you were chosen him before
[1:19:14] the foundation of the world when the
[1:19:15] lamb was chosen then you were chosen
[1:19:17] with him before the foundation and you
[1:19:19] are as I said last night an attribute of
[1:19:21] God's thinking see that's the only way
[1:19:23] you can be eternal and only form of
[1:19:25] eternal life there's only one form of
[1:19:26] eternal life and that's God so that's
[1:19:28] all he is the one that's eternal so it's
[1:19:33] God doing the seeking its God doing the
[1:19:38] calling it's God from start to finish so
[1:19:43] so Paul is going through and he's
[1:19:46] telling us he's trying to establish this
[1:19:49] is why God is just in condemning you
[1:19:51] this is why God is is right when he
[1:19:56] leaves when he has you in this condition
[1:19:58] of condemnation this is why you need the
[1:20:04] gospel which is the power of God unto
[1:20:07] salvation for every one that believes
[1:20:11] but who are the ones that believe those
[1:20:13] who are deigned to eternal life believe
[1:20:16] who are the ones that choose God the
[1:20:20] ones that God comes and says I'm
[1:20:22] changing your desire I'm changing your
[1:20:25] will I'm opening your eyes that's the
[1:20:27] key he opens our eyes he opens our
[1:20:33] understanding so that then we have the
[1:20:36] capability to say yes to say Amen it's
[1:20:40] him doing it you choose sin because
[1:20:45] that's your nature
[1:20:46] you reject God because that's your
[1:20:50] nature nature I grew up in a Christian
[1:20:53] home my parents taught me to believe
[1:20:55] that believe the Bible when someone
[1:20:58] asked me about the Bible I didn't matter
[1:20:59] how rotten of a life I was living I said
[1:21:02] yes to it
[1:21:03] and yet I wanted something different
[1:21:08] guess what my wanting something
[1:21:10] different resulted in a few tears and
[1:21:13] continuing in the same sin what changed
[1:21:19] when God came to me and changed me I was
[1:21:25] choosing him all the day long I was
[1:21:27] saying I want you I just want to change
[1:21:29] I want to be different and then when I
[1:21:31] was really confronted with something
[1:21:34] sinful I chose it and then I felt bad
[1:21:38] about it but what happened what what
[1:21:41] what was different he changed my desire
[1:21:46] he opened he he opened my understanding
[1:21:50] to something that I never had an
[1:21:53] understanding of before and that that's
[1:21:55] what he does for you and I we can live
[1:21:57] in a godly home we can have the right
[1:21:59] influence around us that's wonderful
[1:22:01] that's the best scenario you can
[1:22:04] possibly have parents that are praying
[1:22:06] for you parents that are pointing you to
[1:22:08] the scriptures parents that are doing
[1:22:11] all they can with their own fallible
[1:22:14] life to live for Christ that's the best
[1:22:17] situation you can possibly have and yet
[1:22:19] it's comes up way short because it has
[1:22:23] to be God taking you and changing your
[1:22:28] desires giving you a thirst for him
[1:22:30] otherwise you'll just you'll live a nice
[1:22:33] life you'll be a good kid and you'll
[1:22:34] thirst after the things of the world and
[1:22:37] you might not thirst for the extreme
[1:22:38] things of the world
[1:22:39] you'll still thirst for the things of
[1:22:41] the world until he comes and changes
[1:22:44] your nature changes your desire and only
[1:22:48] he can do that you can't accomplish that
[1:22:52] yourself you know God even has put it a
[1:22:55] conscience within us you know we find
[1:22:58] that we read about that in
[1:23:00] romans chapter 1 in and - he's placed
[1:23:03] that conscious within us but even that
[1:23:05] conscience is marred and hindered by sin
[1:23:10] and doesn't your conscience is
[1:23:12] infallible
[1:23:14] you see things wrong you you make the
[1:23:17] wrong choices and even that conscience
[1:23:20] will take you in the wrong direction so
[1:23:23] it needs to be more than just a
[1:23:26] conscience even with a conscience people
[1:23:30] still choose evil and then they become
[1:23:33] as they continue to choose evil they
[1:23:36] become more and more calloused until
[1:23:38] there's conscience is not even up in
[1:23:40] operation anymore it's just gone dormant
[1:23:45] but even in a Christian home even as a
[1:23:49] good kid you're going to not choose the
[1:23:52] right things you're going to choose evil
[1:23:55] until Christ comes and makes the change
[1:23:59] in you you're not gonna make the right
[1:24:01] choices you're gonna go the wrong way
[1:24:03] you're gonna you're gonna be out of
[1:24:05] balance it takes Christ to come and
[1:24:10] baptize you with a new nature 1st
[1:24:16] Corinthians 15 verse 22 for as in Adam
[1:24:22] all die even so in Christ shall all be
[1:24:26] made alive so Adam is that was the head
[1:24:31] of the human race all of us all the
[1:24:36] elect were in Adam and were to come
[1:24:41] forth from Adam and when Adam sinned he
[1:24:44] was judged and condemned guess what
[1:24:48] guess who else was you and I we sinned
[1:24:52] in Adam
[1:24:53] we were judged in Adam we were condemned
[1:24:55] in Adam so then came a new head
[1:25:01] then came the second Adam Jesus Christ
[1:25:05] and God placed us all the elect of all
[1:25:09] ages in him so he lived
[1:25:13] perfect righteous holy life he shed his
[1:25:17] blood he died in our place he literally
[1:25:20] took our punishment that we deserved God
[1:25:24] poured his wrath out upon Christ and he
[1:25:28] was buried and he was raised up we were
[1:25:30] in him all of his righteousness all his
[1:25:35] resurrection his blood all of that now
[1:25:39] is imputed to us God placed all of our
[1:25:42] sin upon him God takes all of his
[1:25:45] righteousness and places it upon you and
[1:25:48] me that's our only hope
[1:25:54] so it comes again scripture gives the
[1:25:59] possibility in Romans chapter 1 that a
[1:26:02] person could recognize God in his
[1:26:04] creation and could respond and and in
[1:26:09] faith and walk in the right way it gives
[1:26:13] the possibility you understand what I'm
[1:26:18] saying
[1:26:18] God will those who had never heard the
[1:26:21] gospel are gonna be judged based upon
[1:26:23] what they saw not what they saw in
[1:26:25] paganism but what they saw of the
[1:26:28] eternal Godhead in creation and how did
[1:26:32] they respond what does Paul say Paul
[1:26:34] gives the answer of how they'll respond
[1:26:38] there's no one that seeks after God
[1:26:40] there's no one that does good no not one
[1:26:44] all are condemned before him this is the
[1:26:47] basics of the gospel and the only
[1:26:49] practical practical way for them to be
[1:26:52] saved is to be covered by the blood of
[1:26:54] Jesus Christ there's only one way
[1:26:56] there's only one means of salvation
[1:26:58] that's the blood of Jesus Christ it has
[1:27:01] to be applied without the shedding of
[1:27:05] blood there is no forgiveness of sins
[1:27:10] so without the blood of Christ and the
[1:27:12] blood of bulls and goats does not wipe
[1:27:15] away sins it covers them pushes them
[1:27:18] forward until the perfect sacrifice
[1:27:20] comes
[1:27:25] and let's look at that quote and when
[1:27:27] their eyes were opened 1964 that's what
[1:27:32] he come for to clean out them kind that
[1:27:36] the father had given him before the
[1:27:37] foundation of the world a man I feel
[1:27:39] religious when I know that to be the
[1:27:41] truth not he that willeth or he that
[1:27:43] runneth it's God amen not how much you'd
[1:27:45] honor how much you didn't do no man
[1:27:48] sought God God sought you thank the Lord
[1:27:53] Acts chapter 16 verse 14 and a certain
[1:28:01] woman named Lydia a seller of purple of
[1:28:04] the city of Thyatira which worshipped
[1:28:06] God heard us look at this next phrase
[1:28:10] whose heart the Lord opened that she
[1:28:14] attended unto the things which were
[1:28:16] spoken of Paul that's the real
[1:28:18] difference what's the difference between
[1:28:21] the elect and the non elect God opens
[1:28:27] some hearts others he leaves them in
[1:28:30] their own condition you say that's not
[1:28:32] fair God has to give the same
[1:28:34] opportunity to all he does give the same
[1:28:37] opportunity to all but the fact is
[1:28:39] unless look the Lord opens the heart for
[1:28:43] the people are not going to respond so
[1:28:46] rather than letting us all be condemned
[1:28:49] he draws some of us to himself John 6
[1:28:54] verse 44
[1:29:02] no man can come to me except the Father
[1:29:07] which has sent me draw him and I will
[1:29:10] raise him up at the last day
[1:29:11] so can we come to Christ in our own
[1:29:14] effort will we come to Christ in our own
[1:29:16] effort no no man can come to me except
[1:29:21] the Father which has sent me draw him if
[1:29:23] you look at this word draw in the Greek
[1:29:26] it literally means to drag and so God is
[1:29:32] saying God is saying I chose you before
[1:29:33] the foundation of the world
[1:29:35] here is is the word made manifest before
[1:29:39] you I want you to respond and and we
[1:29:44] don't always respond right away but then
[1:29:46] God comes and says okay drags us okay
[1:29:54] that's His grace we it's not our own
[1:30:00] effort it's not what we've done it's
[1:30:03] what he has done for us we in ourselves
[1:30:08] you know our our own righteousness is as
[1:30:12] filthy rags so the best things that
[1:30:16] we've done in our life the best missions
[1:30:19] trips that I have ever had in my life in
[1:30:23] God's eyes are filthy rakes of myself
[1:30:28] ended up myself but because of the blood
[1:30:30] of Jesus Christ those things those
[1:30:35] righteous things that I've done God
[1:30:37] looks at him and says that's perfect
[1:30:40] that's beautiful not because I did it
[1:30:43] but because the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:30:45] covers me and he called me and he
[1:30:48] purposed in me and he sent me and it's
[1:30:51] him the whole time anyways but even that
[1:30:54] there's a lot there's a lot of this that
[1:30:57] needs to die still there's a lot of this
[1:31:00] that needs to change still and so that's
[1:31:03] what the blood is for we need the blood
[1:31:06] every minute every day when you and I
[1:31:09] will never come to the place where we're
[1:31:11] perfect in this life like the perfect
[1:31:14] son of God
[1:31:15] we will never do that I don't care we
[1:31:18] will come to a place of perfection the
[1:31:21] Bible says but what does that mean does
[1:31:25] that mean sinless it does not mean
[1:31:26] sinless
[1:31:27] it means maturity completion will reach
[1:31:30] the place where we've arrived where God
[1:31:33] has wanted us to arrive and then we'll
[1:31:36] be raptured and it's not our effort that
[1:31:40] does it it's the work of God within us
[1:31:43] that does it and I'm so glad that God
[1:31:48] didn't leave me to my own free will I'm
[1:31:51] so glad that God was gracious enough to
[1:31:55] drag me to Christ to come and say look I
[1:32:00] you're trying on your own and it's a
[1:32:03] miserable failure he grabbed me and he
[1:32:06] said hear it here's my son here's your
[1:32:10] representative and he changed me put
[1:32:15] that life inside of me it was him doing
[1:32:18] it
[1:32:19] it was him all alone it was him chain
[1:32:21] who's him changing my desire it was him
[1:32:25] ordering my footsteps and ordering your
[1:32:28] footsteps from start to finish
[1:32:31] music musicians could come so our free
[1:32:38] will does not amount to a whole lot it
[1:32:44] really doesn't it's not it's you know
[1:32:47] people the people that I kind of grew up
[1:32:49] with spiritually they talked about free
[1:32:52] will and they went through the
[1:32:53] scriptures and talked about free will
[1:32:54] offerings and free will free will God
[1:32:57] gives us free will and at the end of the
[1:33:00] day if you really see it scripturally
[1:33:01] our free will leads us only to sin
[1:33:05] because we're in bondage to it and it
[1:33:08] takes Christ to set us free isn't this
[1:33:12] really simple isn't this just gospel 101
[1:33:19] it's not your it's not your choice of
[1:33:22] Christ that sets you free it's his
[1:33:26] choice of you his calling he
[1:33:28] drawing and then then his spirit that
[1:33:31] changes you and then from beginning to
[1:33:34] end he's the one that keeps you he's the
[1:33:37] one that guides your life he was the one
[1:33:39] that takes care of you and if he if we
[1:33:42] were left alone
[1:33:43] which he never will and he said he never
[1:33:45] would but if he left you alone he would
[1:33:50] be a miserable creature you you would
[1:33:53] not make it to the end but thank God he
[1:33:56] promised in his word that he wouldn't
[1:34:00] lose a one we we would fall away if it
[1:34:06] wasn't for him but he said I won't lose
[1:34:11] one thank the Lord
[1:34:14] that's that's that's our only hope and
[1:34:18] and for young people they're listening
[1:34:22] in and you're you're good kids we we
[1:34:27] recognize that some of the best absolute
[1:34:30] best it's not good enough only perfect
[1:34:35] righteousness is gonna make it
[1:34:38] and that's only Jesus Christ in his
[1:34:41] blood and only he can apply it by the
[1:34:46] token only he can do it so what is my
[1:34:49] part then ask him ask him to change you
[1:34:55] ask him to change your desire ask him to
[1:34:57] give you power to walk in in obedience
[1:35:01] and be a witness of Jesus Christ
[1:35:03] that's only he can do it you're not
[1:35:08] gonna work yourself into it you're not
[1:35:11] gonna hear the greatest preacher in the
[1:35:12] world and and while I heard that person
[1:35:15] and now I got it you might just be in
[1:35:17] your car driving down the road and say
[1:35:19] Lord I'm sick of me I want you and he
[1:35:23] can he could do that it isn't about
[1:35:26] being here being another place hearing
[1:35:29] this preacher you can hear the worst
[1:35:31] preacher at this church which is me and
[1:35:33] God can change you
[1:35:35] why because has nothing to do with me
[1:35:38] it's him from start to finish
[1:35:42] amen let's pray father we love you so
[1:35:46] much Lord and we know there's people
[1:35:48] that are needy Lord and and hurting and
