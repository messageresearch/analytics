bit of a different service this evening and i sent out to the senior youth that i would like for them to have a little bit of time to come up and have a few words to say in recognition of the great things that god did for him during camp time and i've also asked brother trav and sister deb if they'll come up with them and told sister deborah that a lot of the senior youth already looked to them as their youth parents and so we want to have them uh have a few words to say in fact is i'm probably going to make you guys go first to break the ice with young people so amen don't worry travis always has a lot to say so amen if you um if you want a short testimony service don't call brother travis amen but he's got a lot to be thankful for god has moved in his life i don't hear myself so well brothers i don't want a whole lot of monitor right now oh yeah super duper yeah if i can just get a little more sound up here maybe not a great amount i don't like a whole lot um but just a little bit more than that amen we're happy to have you all here we had a wonderful time uh over the weekend my goodness it was um it was it's hard to describe all the things that god did for us at that camp and it's all online i've got a uh a little video i'm going to show you here in a few minutes i don't think they have it ready just quite yet but that's fine we'll get to it a little bit uh but we they did a skit and it wasn't actually live streamed i know many of you were live streaming and that was a less than ideal situation how brother mike and brother george pulled that off i'm really not even sure but we they kept messing around with it until it got good enough amen so i hope you were able to watch it uh from home regardless of that we should have it all on the archives now the archives are jacked up just a little bit so brother matt's going to work on those and get them synchronized a little better and retitled a little bit so just give us some be patient we'll get it amen and we'll have it are you happy in the lord tonight amen sister johanna god bless you praise the lord happy to have you jesus both these are your daughters all right praise god we're at the camp praise the lord god bless you so y'all should probably come up and testify too amen praise the lord um sister joanna and i have uh her with her family and her dad brother brother danny um is it manitoba am i thinking i'm getting old-timers a little bit so but i was up there in the land of milk and honey is what they call it you didn't think i'd remember that did you and uh for real though it really is they get they uh they they have a reason for saying that but i was up there visiting ministering some services with brother eugene which is brother-in-law two brother danny so sister joanna is his niece and uh she had a horse named sunny beautiful wow beautiful horse was sunny a palomino just a gorgeous animal and i love animals of all kind and i went to when i said hey can i ride this horse sure go right ahead so me and sonny took off into the wilderness and i knew sonny knew you know was it was he a boy or a girl a gelding so what is that okay he was gelding so me and this gelding took off and we rode through the wilderness and uh i ended up at a at an old quarry looked like um they had been quarrying stone out of the ground or something and so sonny and i are just you know and i consider myself a pretty good uh horseman or rider of horses but even i don't know what a gelding is but i think i know amen but we were riding along the edge and the earth gave way and me and sonny went into the deep amen and uh you know i'm not a panicky type of person and i immediately knew you know i i'll never be able to get out of here because uh the ground is giving away but i knew sonny had four-wheel drive so i just held on to the horn and sure enough sonny pulled him herself up out of the out of the uh out of the water and took me with her and when i got on the ground i i let go and sonny took off and i'll tell you what that horse ran about i would say 20 or 30 yards just hard away i thought man i'm gonna have a long walk home and that horse just took off running and just stopped about 30 yards and dug in and wheeled around and come back to me and just let me have it i mean i couldn't speak horse but whatever whatever sonny was saying that horse was not happy and i mean he was right in my face letting me know it and i'm sorry sonny i'm so sorry i got too close to the edge and oh my so i remember that uh really well amen i'm glad i survived it praise the lord so where we have some a lot of history with brother eugene and sister sarah and through them we met brother danny and his wife and went there and and all all of his family and a wonderful church there we ministered in years and years and years ago one of my one of my greatest uh deliverances of something because of a deep trial that i was current that i was in because of something that had happened in this church many years ago and just one of those pastor things where you just uh boy you almost don't even know what to do you you don't know whether to go forward back up sit still or run away and you know i i it was affecting the church and i didn't even realize it i couldn't figure out what was wrong with the church it seemed to be under a cloud this for most of all y'all this is back in the day and not too many of the old original gang left but but uh it was a real real deep trial had some real personal things that happened and come against me and a lot of things like that and i was in a lot of pain a lot of pain and the whole church was just getting darker and darker and darker and i couldn't figure out what was wrong because i knew the scripture promised that you shall know the truth and the truth shall the truth shall make you free not not you know not you'll be free it'll make you free and so i i doubled back and i started looking through all of my material i said lord i'm i'm going back i'm i know i'm preaching the word i know i'm preaching it according to malachi 4. i know i'm on the i know i'm doing that why is it not liberating why is it going down and down and down and uh we preached those services and uh i don't even know if i've ever told your dad this testimony but but there in those services brother eugene preached the last one for me and you know i thought that i went up there to preach some services but actually i went up there not knowing it but i went up there to hear brother eugene preach the last service and when he preached it he literally cut right down into the into the quick of it and he he began to talk about that you can only give out what's in you and and that's it that's the only genuine thing you have anything else is fake and so whatever's in you is really the only genuine authentic thing that can that you can give out and that's fine if your spirit is in good shape and your mind is in good shape your emotions are in good shape and and your faith is in good shape and you're and everything but if you're hurt if you're wounded if you're crying if you're dark then what happens is that's going to project because i learned a lesson many years ago from brother lonnie spirits travel on words and so even though i was preaching the word that spirit of hurt and wound in me was hopping on the word writing it like a pony into the ears of the people down into their hearts and contaminating my own congregation i didn't even know that could happen i i and when brother eugene preached that it was just like an epiphany and i was just blown away and in a moment and i mean just just like that god revealed to me what was wrong and it was in my own heart and i had to i had to uh i had to jettison that i had to get rid of that i had to let my heart be clean and clear because i couldn't help anybody everybody around me was being wounded the people i cared about the most this church my family being wounded and uh i don't even know why i'm telling the story i haven't thought about it in years maybe you're here tonight but it brings it all back and i'm gonna tell you something friends i came back with just the power of that revelation and i just thought you devil you're not gonna get to i'm not gonna grant that anymore you're gone you're out of here and i put that thing out of my mind and i've cleaned out my heart before the lord and the lord come down and anointed me i sit in that service for a long time weeping and when i came home i went right back to preaching the same word i had preached before i left and all of a sudden the sun came out and the clouds moved back and the church started to lift and rise and like a breeze come in and and and everybody got free and i'll tell you something friends that was a lesson that i'll never forget to this day you this is why you must never allow your heart and mind to become contaminated with life see paul has a recommendation that if that should happen to you just all you got to do is drop back and here's here was where my failure was he said just drop back and consider him who suffered such contradiction of sinners against himself the one who was innocent the one who had never done anything wrong and god traded him for a bunch of a bunch of sinners like us and he said and paul said think about him and what he the the wrong how he was wrong lest you be wearied and faint amen and so you know um it it was such a a lesson of liberation i was i was speaking on i'm gonna i'm gonna read my text here in a minute but and i'm just kind of going along under anointing i didn't have any of that plan to say it's not in my notes anywhere i haven't even opened my notes but uh but you know it it ironically it goes exactly along with what the lord spoke to me at home and what he spoke to me fresh standing on that landing just where i walked in the door before i was sorry any of your faces the lord met me right there and said you need to go to philippians oh i just is [Laughter] misunderstandings a oh okay the terrible situation that's going to befall the world and i've said it to you here before i said it to the young people there are as we speak right now in real time happening in real time there's an irreversible truth an irrevocable uh reality that there are for the world and i hate to be the bearer of bad tidings but to this world the bible is clear there are catastrophic judgments rushing to meet us and the only way out is up amen you can't run east and west north and south there's nowhere you go in the earth he won't do you any good to to go underground into a bunker you're gonna the only way to get out of this is going up and so i i like that song i'm going in the rapture amen and and daniel when he's talking about that and all the things that the antichrist system will do he drops a little notation under prophecy it's almost like almost marooned because it's right in the middle of horrible descriptions of what's going to happen under judgments but he said the people during that time that the people who know their god will do great exploits and i just say i'm that people are you that people tonight to say right here at the time i'm gonna do great exploits what's the greatest exploit you can do press press toward the mark throw off everything of the world get everything out of your life anything that hinders you you cannot live in this day hindered it's too hard thank you kindly y'all y'all can go amen young man knows his daddy so it's it's time to press it's time to matter it's time to stand up and be counted it's time to stand for the truth of this hour i believe that we're living in that time amen one of the things they did that wasn't streamed was they did a skit that uh sister deborah put together largely and all the team coalesced around her and uh and and rehearsed it and practiced it and and they put it on there uh at the youth camp and wow i i just man say it backwards wow it it i was stunned i it was so amazing and and we find that it was a story about a prophecy about a a boy king who would come to the throne and jeroboam was causing israel to sin and and and and idolatry was entering the land jeroboam is the one who took the ten tribes away from rehoboam and went into samaria the northern kingdom became the northern kingdom of israel and judah remained true there with the city of david and rehoboam the son of solomon carried on but both of them finally you know it got so bad that that they came in and and took northern israel and took the ten tribes captive a hundred years prior and then finally it comes down and judah's still there and they they raise up a king by the name of josiah and it's incredible when he when he took the throne at eight years old at eight years old josiah took the throne a boy king and he had been pursued because there was an evil woman trying to assassinate all of the royal lineage because she had she had you know she had uh her own ambitions for the for the power herself and so we find that some righteous people hid the child away and held him for eight years until they he was just old enough to bring him to the throne and crown him and blow a trumpet and all all judah would then receive that which is what they did and then she had a sad ending herself and so which is always going to be true when you come against god's word and when he comes you know he's he's 8 years old and obviously he had been raised with some morals i tell you there's value in raising your children with morals there's value with teaching them uh you know put put some value in their life about what's right and what's wrong and that right and wrong matter because that's what's absent today nobody cares what's right wrong all things are relative everything's right everything's fine it's all in the eye of the beholder but the thing they lose sight of it is in the eye of the beholder but only one beholder there's only one eye judging it and it's not the eye of the person it's the i above who sees all and knows all and judges all and that's where the world is going to get a rude awakening and and and so this boy king comes to the throne he's already got a heart to know the lord and and by the time he's 16 all right everywhere foreign [Laughter] opinion to worry about i mean he's a king but there could be a revolt when you've got ungodly people you never know what's going to happen and he's he starts a renovation project on the temple and while they're renovating it they find an original scroll of moses the original and they bring it and give it to his officer and his officer comes and now he's moving toward 20 years old so at 8 years old at 16 years old at 18 years old and now he's 20. now he's now he's he's so zealous because now he's got the lord he's terrified because he knows no one has read this thing in a long time and nobody's keeping it and he starts reestablishing the passover and he starts taking down the groves and he starts firing all the old priests and starts putting in new men of god i mean this is a national revival now it's it's interesting because the people really aren't it's not really in their heart as a majority because as soon as he dies they go right back to idolatry almost immediately under his son so it was a it was a regulated uh why yeah i know you you need me to use it yeah okay okay it's on you just you need me to preach to it okay gonna tie one hand behind my back oh gideon what i'm already preaching too long what are you pointing at your watch oh for the online audience very good okay praise the lord okay i thought he's doing like my dad brother eddie was a little more crafty than that he'd wear his watch upside down and i'd see me just kind of go but he's he's zealous for god and he starts pressing now what's amazing is that when jeroboam was bringing the nation into such sin and idolatry there was a man of god that came up out of judah and stood at an altar of one of the idolatrous gods he was worshiping and right as jeroboam was you know he's like the king and he's doing a religious ceremony he's offering to this false god and the man of god starts to prophesy against the altar and this is what they did in the play this is this was the whole scene of how that of how that he prophesied against that altar and said someday this altar will hold the bodies and bones of the priest who are sacrificing on it and they will be sacrificed on it and god will destroy this altar and he'll raise up a king by the name of josiah it's one of the only times in the bible where it literally named it that far in advance say so josiah was josiah on the scene no so he's like 10 years out no 15 no 20 no 290 years later you can imagine by this time nobody still believed that prophecy you can imagine by this time nobody thought to play where they're gonna have a king named josiah it's 290 years later and a boy king comes to the throne and he's full of the zeal of the lord and he's so disturbed when he reads the law of moses he don't even know what to do about it and he calls forth a prophetess oh foreign foreign is what [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] a deborah jackson film amen amen [Applause] and you know i watched god move at that meeting and i watched i i i have to sit back now and in my mind's eye and wonder lord surely you had some josiahs those 370 or whatever campers we had and and then uh uh seemed like an innumerable host of helpers and counselors uh but i'm wondering i want to say lord what great things you have done and so you know i want to just commend our young people for being willing to to come to a camp like that you'd be you'd be amazed at the aversion that some young teenagers have um brother caleb in his wonderful reprisal of the role of the of the young man who from the teenagers themselves i've heard pastors and ministers and people have written even from overseas and told me how much and what a blessing it has been but tonight i want to give uh the teenagers who are willing to take apart i'm going to bring them all up here with travis and deborah and as many of them as want to give a minute or so half a minute of just testimony and reflections of what god did for them amen so at this time brother travis you and sister deborah come on up and all all you campers come on up amen come on up here with me let's come on up and gather around behind me amen this is our senior youth group and couldn't be more proud of them now is there any way this is going to work yeah okay so we're going to let them step up to this does anybody need this i can turn this off matt oh they need this okay but they can use this right yeah they will they will praise the lord they will wow hi praise the lord god bless you what you can give him now i'm gonna bring him up i'm gonna make him come to the most difficult spot in the church amen praise the lord no i won't do that to him we'll get him a mic i'll let him use this one okay and i'll just hand it to him okay brother george thank you brother travis you're going to start first no preaching yeah so that music that i heard um really magical like you're going to disney world or something and you it's funny because you go to disney world you're expecting something like majestic and magical and you get there and you realize there's a bunch of characters and it's just a facade but i can say that when we went to camp it really was magical you could tell that it was something was happening before and after the camp the devil fought it's pretty wild how you see the devil move before and then during camp you can't find the devil anywhere it's just he was nowhere to be found but then right on the way home it's just like here he is again i had the easiest job probably in the whole camp i just got to hang out with the kids and just play basketball eat food so it was great for me but what one thing that i uh i can i can i didn't notice this before but the people who earn the most credit are the ones that you don't see their faces the ones that are behind the scene and it's amazing to to see this camp unfold i know my wife deborah put so much work into it and i i really appreciate but single handedly she has uh you know put on so much um effort and and the skit was impressive i'm sure you've seen it online but uh hey i'm just gonna hand it over to her and let her continue on there you go i want a young person to go first well i actually wrote some stuff down and i will try to go super fast i can probably i could probably cut some of it out i wanted to start if i can with just a really quick little testimony i told some of you but when we were first starting to think about this camp we decided that there were some things that were really important to us and i mean i say we i really wasn't a part of the idea of the camp that was all brother matt brother jason to mars but um you know they got just a little group of us together after the um the youth event that we had and one of the big things was we wanted to hand pick all the counselors which is a lot harder than you might think you know everybody who was a counselor at camp had to be hand chosen by us and um you know anybody who went to a youth camp knows why that's important and i i happened to be out in flagstaff for the weekend with my mother-in-law and i bumped into some a family that we knew from when i was a kid um when i was really young and their daughters have grown up none of which have been married they're just these great christian girls and i haven't seen these girls in 15 years they they haven't seen my family in 15 years and they happened to be in flagstaff the very weekend that i was there and something kept telling me ask them to be counselors ask them to be counselors but i haven't seen them in so long that i was like just kind of pushing back at that thought but i knew i knew it had to be the lord so i just kind of checked in with some other people to make sure that was okay and then i asked them and when it came down for us to assign the counselors like pretty much to the person we had the exact right number of women counselors and we were scrambling a little but for the like once we finalized it it was the exact same number which i find just crazy considering that they have like the chances of them being there they're from dallas is is so so slim that they would be there the exact same day it wasn't even the same weekend the same sunday morning that i was there and then they were gone after church so they ended up coming to church and their their dorm was so unbelievable these girls had worship services every night with the girls in their dorm they had them singing in all these different languages one of the groups of girls was sister tabby's nieces i had no idea and they formed these tight bonds with these three girls their lives are changed the girls lives are changed and i think that's just unbelievable so i know that that's probably the longest thing i have to say but um it was my privilege to be a part of this youth camp i don't feel like i did anything compared to what brother jason and sister amy did matt and rachel tony and amber brad and sarah yance chastity and doug you guys just you really i did the fun stuff i got to play music and play with the young people everybody else got to sit up all night doing the hard work you know you young people don't realize how hard we pray for you and how much we love you i know my kids are still young but we have such a burden for you guys we love you so much like you're our own kids some of you are our own kids but um to see you um you know i was playing the piano i was really close to all of you you know the prayer line and getting to see you all go up and i saw almost all of you in the prayer line and each time i saw one of you i just my heart melted and i i love you guys so much and i'm so thankful you all got to be a part of it i know that satan used the last year to create a lot of havoc and depression in our young people and i feel like the lord used the ministers time after time in every service to call that out and to demolish all demons of fear and anxiety and depression just time after time it was like that was not the main theme of camp but it was just completely utterly demolished and that was really special to me i feel like the camp was just a haven for people who've struggled through the last year and for me personally you know going through a lot with my family moving away and just a lot of personal struggles for me getting to be a part of it was just a life-changing experience definitely um i know that there were a few other goals that were talked about at the beginning of camp and i was just um i guess i won't go into them all because i'm getting a little long-winded but every single thing that we had discussed when we were planning camp that was crucially important that we wanted to accomplish through this camp just in my rounds of talking with young people and talking with other people at the camp every single one of those boxes were checked and i know that wasn't us as people that was the lord making it happen i mean even down to the exact wording of some of the stuff we said brother jason namara said the most important thing he wanted was for us to focus on teaching young people and not just you know not just some big revival service which is great and we had some of that and that's wonderful but we wanted to focus on teaching young people important things and that was one of the biggest thing things that young people kept coming up to me saying was i learned so much thank you so much for providing that to us and so i just feel like that was a really special thing and then one other personal testimony was travis was saying how satan was fighting us so badly when we got back and it was absolutely unspeakable just the amount of stress that as soon as camp was over it was like the ride home we were all just angry and tired and i'm thinking to myself this is crazy because 20 minutes before we left we're happy and laughing and joking and it was like the whole ride home satan was fighting and i've talked to so many people who were there already and just said satan was so mad that the entire day after camp it was just a constant bombarding and something really interesting happened to me last night i had to drive sarah and the boys to the airport and um you know that was a really hard thing for me to do it's hard to see them go so i kind of wanted to be alone and i've had travis keep the kids had to drive them to savannah and um i figured i would just drive home and listen to some worship music and listen to brother branham and just pray and something very strange happened to me when i dropped them off i had this wave of exhaustion that was so intense i could not keep my eyes open and i had the whole drive home the whole way down 95 i was like trying to slap myself in the face stomp my feet try to stay awake it was so intense and i i fell asleep at the wheel and it when i realized it i i shook myself awake and i pulled into the hardyville walmart thinking i i think i in the back my mind knew it was the devil i could tell it was almost like a like a supernatural blanket just causing me to fall asleep at the wheel so i reclined my chair laid back and i was just out like a light and then i sat up straight a little while later and i when i pulled in it was about 10 30 something like that at night i sat up straight it was after one o'clock i think it was like 1 30 and um it startled me to have slept that long so i immediately turned on the car backed out and i'm thinking i'm wide awake i'm gonna drive home and within seconds i was already just like in like falling asleep again and that has never happened to me i was it was i can't describe it i know it seems silly to some of you but i really believe satan was trying to kill me that's how intense this was so the whole way home i'm just like trying so hard to stay awake i pull onto my street and a deer jumps out right in front of me i thought i was going to clip it but i kept thinking to myself because my car it kind of drives itself a little bit and if i had just relaxed and and dozed a little bit i would have hit that car or that deer and i just you know i was thinking that through all of that i could tell satan was fighting me he was fighting us all emotionally i'm sure he was fighting all of you guys because he's so furious that you were all there and that you all did receive something from the lord and i know i did he would love nothing more to rob you of that blessing to rob your parents who worked so hard to rob them of that blessing and apparently he wants to rob me of my life as well because i feel like that very well could have happened last night so i just want to give all the glory to the lord and thank him for preserving my life and for preserving all of us and for giving us such a great time at camp [Applause] okay never mind first one second no wait we decided this is josh that was at the camp this is he's back to josh am i getting nominated yes you've been you've been pressed into into service i was hoping he goes first because he had a more articulate he has notes i don't have any of that classic twin thing of thought so we know totally different but uh yeah so camp well i had a nice crazy week before camp because um you know contracting covet is never a fun thing and i experienced that for the first time so yay so yeah two two weeks before camp but it was fun not at all uh and the whole church got covered pretty much and churches were closed down and then i had to stay home the last day of corn the last sun that we had here so i didn't get any services until that thursday night so it was it was a long time before i had been in church so that was nice in itself uh the skit oh the skit that was that was interesting uh you know uh you know deborah told me she approached me first about the skit you know i had no idea what the skit was about uh she told she told me my part said it'd be perfect for the the devil so thanks i i still don't know how to feel about that one uh but starting when we started sitting there on the drawing board trying to write it up you know i had no idea how this was going to go we didn't have a script yet we just started writing the script that day and we had a rough outline by the time i left there that uh that day i think it was a sunday evening we stayed around and tried to write a script but i had no idea how it was going to turn out you know i and then the script went through a couple changes and so that was interesting in itself and then i had one of the bigger parts so that's always nerve-racking they said caleb was the main character but in my mind i feel like i was but in my defense he sat on a bed and watched half the play because so i had the most lines so main character there we go uh but it was a lot of lines and a lot and it was like 300 some people that's definitely the yeah yeah all right yeah but um yeah the skit went phenomenally way better than i thought it was gonna it was sorry dab but it went really really well it was a super amount of blessing for everyone a lot of people told me that i did well which was nice but they also told me i played satan really well so take from that what you will uh still processing that one but um overall the uh the time i was there you know the biggest blessing to me was honestly everyone there who was running it uh i know jason said that um the uh deborah and travis are our youth parents and they really are but honestly all the adults here or yeah all i can brother jason and sister amy my mom and dad uh matt and rachel just those are the ones i can think of on the top of my head yeah i'm getting to it uh you know even aft before the camp you all these adults and or all of the youth people leading you know i felt such a strong uh feeling that you guys really want to help the youth and are working with the youth and you know you've all been an inspiration in my life even before this camp and been helping me every step of the way i've been here and you know brother jason talked about um i think was a d-day youth had that thing about yeah he was listing off all the though yeah normandy listening all the weapons and stuff that they were using you know and what i'm thinking about it is it's hard to face all of those weapons without someone at your back and you know i feel like this entire church has my back this adult the use everybody so i really appreciate that thank you a blessing i'm done now i'll just say he did not have a very hard time at home with covid he uh was able to stay home and get paid so great job we of course coveted your prayers as well and i'm sure that's what brought him through but we we know that is because god always comes through so just a few things that i wrote down it won't be super long um now when i was there i've never been the type of person that usually runs around the church and screams and hollers but i don't believe that's what needs to happen for something to change in your life i believe it can happen right in your pew you don't have to go up to the front and alter calls you know those aren't even something that are mentioned very often or at all in the bible that just doesn't need to happen and i'm glad that's the case he can talk personally to me wherever i'm at and so one of the main things is that i like to push at least for this testimony is the friends that i made one specifically and talking with other christians helps me realize what i can improve on myself just because i have different perspectives from different people and so what i was able to learn from my friend his name is gideon gibbs just to give him credit and so we this isn't even at the camp it was after the camp just being able to talk about a worship and when i'm in camp or in any service i'm singing songs but i'm also thinking am i just singing this song just to sing it am i here just because of out of habit am i really genuine in this moment and sometimes to be very truthful the answer is no i'm not and i want that to change and that has changed i attribute that to god and everything that i read on that screen i mean it with all my heart and i want that to be the case for everybody you're not there just to show up and play church that's not what we're here for another thing was i did go for prayer and um with brother diggs and so i asked specifically about um i'm hopefully going to be going through changes in life for the better um maybe have a family who knows it's just something that happens with age and time and so i don't know exactly how to go about that it's very hard um being in a leadership role and that makes me nervous and so i want leadership from the lord and i went to brother dick and i said hey i need some help i gotta know where the direction to go to and he said ask the lord very specific things don't leave out any details and i said okay i'm gonna do that and i've actually experienced some success with that in the past specifically with my job my job is definitely not something that i want to keep for a very long time but while i'm in it it's a little bit stressful and sometimes you have to hit your specific numbers to continue it's a commission-based job and so you have to make sure you're on top of it and that's very stressful for me so i needed to sell five phones that's more than i've ever sold ever in one day that's never happened and so the most of maybe got was four and i needed five to make it through that month so i sold three that day just person after person after person came in that i had ordered phones for previously and it's very rare that you're able to fulfill a phone that you ordered yourself because you move stores all the time so that in itself is a miracle i was able to help the customers out and that way it just helps me hit the numbers more now even better i'd even have to be um at work for two more of those phones to come through while i was at camp so i was like well that's cool i'm not going to complain about selling things i'm not even there for so i really give the god the glory for that and for all the youth for what it's worth i'm not full of wisdom and some of others of you are but ask very specific things and if you believe it with all your heart you have the right attitude about it the right motivation and objective he can't say no god bless [Applause] as someone who has been to quite a few camps over the years i really love camps because that's one of the biggest ways for me to make friends because i know other people and i'm kind of an introvert so they make me meet their friends so it's really easy for me that way um but this year going to camp for me camps are always kind of like an encouragement boost uh because you know all the stuff centered around youth and youth specific issues and stuff um and something you know i've been struggling with over the last year is just overall joy you know grief can take a lot of your joy away and dealing with all of that it has made it harder for me at camps than it normally would be and i went to bethel tabernacle in july june july and that camp helped a lot but something that can happen at camps is camps can get into kind of a pattern of not necessarily fake experiences but getting caught up in the idea of experiences instead of experiencing real things with god and i was really not expecting to go to this camp and get as much of an experience as i did and seeing just so many of my really close friends and loved ones get so much more to camp than i was expecting and praying for and it just it really helped me a lot and just gave me encouragement for the next year and just i hope it's just as good next year as it was this year so yeah [Applause] okay but since you gave me the mic i guess i'll go anyway um yeah camp was awesome camp was great i think i went there um not really expecting a lot i mean i knew it was going to be great but like for me personally i didn't i wasn't expecting a lot i just knew my parents were planning this camp so i just went and i got a really good experience with camp and apparently everyone else did and then you could tell the devil was defeated at that camp because my mom even told me you know when the battle is almost over and the losing side's about to lose they're going to throw everything they got at you they're going to throw their last ditch effort and you can tell at camp he knew he was defeated and after camp he threw everything he had left at everyone and you could tell that that's the biggest testimony it shows that he knows he was defeated because he was man he sure gave everything he had the last two days like but it was great yeah everyone had a great time i can't wait to go back next year and uh yeah okay so i'm going to start out by thanking everyone who made the camp possible um all of the people who helped out all of the counselors especially um i formed a special i formed a special bond with my counselor actually and he sent me a message after camp um and i'd like to just read that message because it was really special to me and it uh really helped me for exactly what i needed so let me get this okay so he said i really wanted you all to see that you don't have to stop being you to serve the lord being young is a gift and sometimes as adults we suck all the fun out of christianity and it can drive our young people away use that gift of youth to build the lord's kingdom and his people and use him for what you and use what you are on what what you love for him it was nice meeting you as well so that was really special to me and it was exactly what i needed to hear so i just wanted to say that also she's going to kill me for this but amariah's special was probably the best special i may be i may be a little biased here but it's definitely the best best special she's ever given and it's definitely the best special i think i've ever heard so you should go uh listen to that for sure [Applause] uh not good at talking in front of people like this but um yeah our dorm leader um he's actually was my cousin peter hall and i agree with you ryan like he has a lot of wisdom and he's young it's not something you expect with someone his age but um he really made our dorm like all of us had a connection like it was like i've known them for years don't ask me names not that i don't know them that well but the whole camp was just a real it was really nice it was like it was really beautiful it was everything was kind of easy access but i was on crutches i'm like it was kind of easy but i just i do want to thank everyone that made it possible and deb and travis you really are like our mom so thanks mom thanks dad [Applause] anybody else so um i decided to give you a test yeah and since we're in front of everybody and it would be perfect this is an intelligence test and a truth test okay you ready intelligence tests first you ready what's your name right he passed nice okay truth test am i the greatest papal of all time absolutely am i still legendary absolutely okay you passed all right praise the lord give him a hand okay y'all can go sit down god bless you thank you amen praise the lord i should have made ahab testify oh yeah on the okay okay we'll get to it just a second here mason i was laughing so hard every time i watched that replay it was it was just two words and he had it he had to repeat it but it was so funny so if you want to go online and catch that i won't i won't spoil that but it was so funny hey man he was perfect for it and my my own granddaughter was so crazy here she is dressed up as a character i didn't know it was her and i'm standing admiring thinking wow she's a good actress and i know it was my own granddaughter and so she was almost disguised but i also want to move to to the next section of it and i know we're starting to get a little pressed for time i told brother matt i said i learned a secret here you never give a microphone to a preacher or a preacher's daughter amen amen praise the lord so what we'd like to do now is um i'm going to call out categories and if you were served in any of these categories you might have served in multiple ones it would not surprise me if one person served in multiple categories i got a ton of names here but we have these categories and i'm going to call you to come up here and stand not on you don't understand the platform it's like to have you come in front stand up and line up in front of here we had people in registration and check-in and and the command center team this is how brother matt labeled it to me registration check-in and command center team if you would make your way forward and come up and stand up here we also had a security team we'd like for those members who were on the security team to come stand we also had a deacon team and we like for those brothers to come we also had food and con i'll start calling names and and uh we had food and concessions and we had the skit team not the actors y'all were just up here but the skit team and we also had a shuttle team and we had uber drivers camp uber drivers so we also had video and i.t and a booth team we also had musicians team and we also had audio video transport team the people who carried everything and we had others that don't go to the church that helped in major ways we had counselors if you're here and you were a counselor if you were on the medical team uh if you were on the camp choir had anything to do with the camp choir we want you to come stand up here right now and then i'm gonna get to the last one here just in a minute and we'll save the leadership team for just another brief minute here so praise the lord so this should be everyone not everyone's here oh i know yeah this should be everyone attending that's registration check-in and command center team security team deacon team food and concession skit team yes sister ruth i saw her name on the camp choir and also saw her on the medical team and um uh-huh so um are we missing her oh okay are you pinned it be pinned in okay all right no worries all right so um um let me see here okay all right and then um video i.t booth music audio counselors and medical team amen and there are many uh that are not here tonight brother anthony was the head of our security and uh we were missing him tonight uh that i know he's out of town also brother douglas is uh working out of town and so he was a big part as usual anybody else out of town oh caleb okay i don't see caleb no he's not here tonight joy okay so brother caleb is also not here anybody else we can think of that should be up here that's not not at church um in the teams i named we don't want to forget anybody that's why i didn't call names that is called categories so if you missed it you missed it on your own amen this what you see here was the was the what was largely as uh one somebody said one of the young people the people behind the scenes that just quietly went about their work and their labor and it was amazing i'm here to tell you we had so many people saying people with experience people who knew what they were talking about that it was as if our team had been running camps for 20 years i heard that so many times people said you don't you don't understand brother jason i've been to camps everywhere it was like i said they said that this is your very first year how in the world did you pull this off sister amy was telling me they did months of planning in in weeks and it was amazing and for all of those others who are not here i just want to say myself and on behalf of sister debbie and i and the entire assembly and all the parents and all the young people thank you you can be seated god bless you god bless you i want to bring up our leadership team as well and if their wives can come back with them that would be amazing our director and co-director of course was brother matt and brother jason demars i so appreciate what these brothers were able to accomplish i appreciate you know we had a testimony they might give it but jason might give it he gave it to me about how that sister amy was his saving grace because she remembered so much that covet had devastated his memory and mine and preparations over and i'm so happy to have brother jason still here and the devil tried hard to take him hard i mean hard and we were praying so earnestly around the world brother jd they are praying for you on every continent where the message believers are and thousands and thousands of people and for brother mark who the enemy um actually did take him out two or three times in those like i said in the last testimony service the lord just kept giving him back amen and there was there was others uh who were very sick and uh very very and suffered greatly but were happy for the lord who intervened amen we had sister kathy testifying brother jack here uh the other week and so i'm just glad for what god did but i'm i'm particularly thankful for brother matt and brother jason because um you know these two brothers really shouldered the lion's share and uh i i i'm so glad and i i know that some of them stream this service and matt asked me to be careful but i'm just so happy that brother matt is still with us amen and i know that there would be many other churches not just western but there'd be many churches who would like to have brother matt but he felt led that the lord had him here amen his place was with you and me amen and i just couldn't be more proud of him for the job he did and i know that i know that a lot and i don't even know all that went into it but i know it was a lot it was one of the easiest things i ever pulled off because i had to do almost nothing and and rachel tirelessly rachel is just incredible and uh i just appreciate her so much and brother jason and sister amy um uh coming alongside brother matt and sister rachel to say yep we'll share in that vision we want to do it as well and so brother jd why don't you come on up you and sister amy and uh say something for the lord here yes sir amen thankful to be here i think it's not about it's not about us it's about what the lord is doing and it was about seeing god work in the hearts of the young people that's all we wanted to see and whatever effort it took to put into it it's a small thing just to see some of the testimonies we sent out a survey some of you probably seen it if you haven't filled it out fill it out we've gotten so far 119 answers and a hundred percent said overall they had a positive experience at the camp so we're so grateful for that that's what we that's what we work so hard for and that's the effort that we put in is that god would move in their lives there was a lot of testimonies that came back i'm gonna go in and just read a couple of them one young man says i've been dealing with anger issues my whole life and when i when i was at camp i decided to give my life to god and i've been feeling calm and collected and all my anger is gone and then another person writes in and um says every time before i had an experience quote unquote experience it's been emotional and has lasted for two days i struggled a lot with depression and struggling with my identity well i knew that god wouldn't appreciate that sort of thing there was something inside me pulling me towards that sort of life was a constant battle that pulled me both directions and lately i had been feeling it was pulling me the wrong way on thursday i believe i received the holy ghost but i couldn't be sure it was what it was so many times before i'd been given false hope on friday night i was given a confirmation that this was real now that i'm back home i'm having more determined having more determination to resist amen with god's help i know that i can resist temptation and thoughts that come to me i know that i'm safe in him i want to thank the preachers counselors and the many other people who made this camp possible mostly i'd like to thank god without this camp i might not have made it this far and might now still be lost again you all have my gratitude and to god be the glory there's another one here that i want to make sure that i get to yeah i came to camp this is from i can say the name on this one because i got permission from his parents is from micah curtis stephen emily curtis's son i came to camp not praying for deliverance but praying for god to put the next few steps in my life for his perfect will i had applied for an amazing job in a very competitive field i prayed and just left it in god's hands and the day after i got home from camp i was leaving my current job and got a call back for an interview praising the lord for even the opportunity to interview if god's god wills me to have this job that's amazing but even if i don't get it i'll still praise him let me see i was struggling with knowing if i had the holy ghost but during the second service i reached a level of faith to where i believe i have it now another person says i was i was super bitter about my grandfather's death um and i was delivered i'm so happy um and there's another one that i'm just missing here okay thank you thank you uh yes a person says i received the holy ghost saturday night after almost leaving the message six months earlier so the testimonies are continuing to come in it's only about not even half the campers that have responded so far so we'll we'll we'll make a place for people to be able to see some of the different testimonies come in anonymously but this that's this is why this is why we did this amen and we're so and i'm just so thankful and it's to me that's the reward right there amen brother matt did you have anything wrong with actually it's not a testimony but i just wanted to um to all of the the group from our church that was there um there was a large group of people that were helping me keep an eye on this guy right here and whether that would be taking him back up to the camper bringing him meals giving him rides what not i just want to thank you all so much for taking care of him and helping and given the circumstances around it and what leading up to it when i look back at how how it went that it was so amazing and what what we pulled off the only explanation is god so just want to give him the glory all right how much how much time we got left boy there's so much we don't want to miss out it's got so much i want to say and some will be just a little repeated that was um maybe you already heard and not everyone's here first thing i'll say is not everyone's here not nearly everyone i know there's a lot streaming online i looked earlier a lot streaming to see this so uh some of these things i just wrote for my own personal notes first i would just like to say and i know it's been emphasized that you have no idea and there's no way i could have the time to express out of everyone who put so much into the planning stages i know it was said that we pulled off something that was done in weeks we this has been we had months how many months the day even before our youth camp meetings that we had here we were already planning and directly after that went right into further planning for youth camp we had a dozen or more uh i don't know how many uh meetings just hours and hours and hours and hours till late hours of the night uh hours of in the planning stages and just praying over some of the core issues of the camp and what we wanted and so there was so much spent so much time i can't even begin to tell you how many hours went into um just making sure everything was was what it was and brother jason and sister amy i don't even know i have no words to put into um and i'm not trying to flatter them but the the gift that god has placed in their life both of them um in some ways it's very similar with logistics and i don't even i don't want to start labeling it because there was there was so much that that brother jason and sister amy had the work that they had put in and i mean elbow grease just hard work and hours of mental labor and data sheets and putting together and double checking and triple checking and quadruple a checklist if we didn't have brother jason and sister amy it wouldn't have been what it was and i really mean that and to watch how the devil tried to just take them and remove them from even getting to go to camp i just want to thank the lord for the victory of the fact that brother jason and sister amy got to go so once you give the lord a hand clapping praise for that and i can tell you that i can tell you that i know brother jason and a lot who didn't know and sister amy both through the the turbulent and the turbulence they went to leading up to camp they didn't go refreshing like some of us who maybe were more refreshed they had every right to go to a cabin in gatlinburg for a month after what they had went through and most everyone else would have just stayed home the only reason they went is because of a burden and a desire for the young people that's the only reason and so to see them labor they already went there i remember after just a few days someone asked me and said brother matt you know the uh he said something and and i think his brother burley i was supposed to text deborah his number so they could they could speak about it that's the skit and brother said brother matt you're tell sister jeff i said oh i forgot he said i knew you would i said brother burleigh you ever ate mashed potatoes he said yeah i said that's what my brain feels like right now and i can't imagine because there they went there with their brains already mashed potatoes and so uh i just want to commend them so many more to come in but just want to commend them because of the hardship that they went through jason when brother jason wasn't recovered still not 100 percent lord's given him his strength back but he just went and he stayed as much as he could and he was there as much as he could so so much work he put into it and i'm just glad he was able to go there and be part of it sister amy as well brother tony who's not even here tonight i wish he was here to stand because brother tony was such an essential part of everything sister amber's representing well here tonight but um brother tony not being here i just wanted to to say thank you in so many categories not just us and them i would never want to portray that but the entire group of leadership that we just that was especially the ones part in the planning stage it puts so much work and time and effort into that we just want to say thank you i want to go through just a list of names that i'm rushing through this i want to make sure that no one was missed that might have been here i know brother doug you already mentioned him sister abby was also part of the registration team she should not hear tonight brother brad and sister sarah yachts and they uh this is their second church you could call it that's what i'll call it here tonight um they aren't here but i know they're streaming and they will stream this by archive essential absolutely essential and i just want to say thank you to them uh in a special way just so essential sister sarah helping also in that command center room the security team there brother brad was also part of that sister sarah brother aaron um is here tonight and brother aaron played many many hats brother aaron was quite a star with the young people with his bass playing he was a star with brother john andy's too actually um he was a real star and he was a real star in my book too because brother aaron anywhere he could help anywhere he could fit in any spot he could do he's up there till two o'clock 1 30 in the morning one night riding on a golf cart just helping with

thank you i want to give them a hand of applause for that means a lot save the church a lot of money from having to rent a vehicle and so we just want to give thanks for that um let me just go through some of these and make sure i don't miss them brother stephen curtis also was part of our music team he's not here and sister emily is a counselor also he was a he was a man we were getting flooded on facebook that's the best dobro player in the message yeah i know he is yep was that the ones that need to be processed though those are dslr okay great so sister emily has a dropbox link uh we're gonna get posted on the what's that she was our camp photographer yep took pictures and there's a lot of good ones we're gonna show you a few of those here tonight um what was you pointing at there um yep yep yep audio video transport we had a team here brother michael gonzalez and different ones brother charles even helped with some of that loading up and taking their um some of the counselors that helped brother brad and sister sarah were the head of the counselor team and the counselors they were just wonderful in that department having many years of experience sister ruth helped with the choir and sister sarah johns told me she said if it wasn't for sister ruth we wouldn't have a camp choir and i know sister ruth doesn't want to hear that but that's what she told me so she was wonderful uh with the music and and also the medical team there all right so that is just some of the names i wanted to make sure uh i didn't get camp filled up fast foot up in seven days when we put out the registration we were full and within i think just a few days our waiting list was over 50 and we had and at that point we didn't know if we were going to get any in and by the grace of god we were able to get all of them in so we had 50 cancellations and 50 roughly 50 replacements um and i want to say deborah sister deborah mentioned started mentioning some names so some of the names we mentioned you do a thanks service like this to give gratitude and they were people that all of us interacted with and were special to and important to that i would have never known i didn't know i know seeing brother doug's chastity but because i wasn't in that part i didn't see some debra mentioned them and different ones didn't get mentioned because they weren't in any direct interaction with them but there were for me so this is just me and i'm just gonna say this there were two people who didn't um wasn't expecting me to say this here tonight didn't tell them i was going to that were i have and i really mean this i have no other words to say than angels sent from god to me personally and that's brother george buckman and brother mike gonzalez will you stand up brother mike and brother george i don't know you have i have no words i really don't and i don't i don't mean to make them bigger than any other part because everyone played such an important part but i'm just giving you from my experience you don't realize how essential that had those two brothers not shown up and been faithful there and diligent and and i tell you what when brother michael and brother george you tell them and give them a task to do something they they give it a hundred thousand percent and they gave that every service today uh every service that we had they were there for hours and spent labor and time and were dedicated on time and while my brains was mashed potatoes um i had some good help because i couldn't have done it without them so i just want to give a special thanks to those two brothers brother jeremy clavel who doesn't even go to this church was also essential on that team goes to brother berry coffees but just the hours i mean i i don't know it we we spent i didn't want to guess how many hours we were there one night till 1 a.m and those brothers were just speaking a language that i didn't understand they were talking about networking and man it was like french i know a lot about computers but that was in a whole nother league and had we not had them i just uh i just can't say enough about that sister wanda and a lot of people don't realize the role sister wanda played when we asked sister wander brother mike to help with the shuttle take over the shuttling service and that was essential how many trips did you take sister wanda you and sister andrea in total 12 one way or two ways one way so 12 one way to greenville airport would be 24 trips sometimes at three o'clock in the morning one was at three a.m six a.m so everyone did a lot sister wanda sister andrea uh didn't even really get to enjoy much of camp because they were faithfully serving in their post and running people back and forth and back and forth and back and forth and when sister wanda was at camp she was running the eight passenger golf cart back and forth to get people around the camp just go go go go go so i just want to take a minute and i'll just say this also at the end of this if brother michael you brother george have any just a minute you won't express anything i'll give you that minute if you wanted to i just they did so much and were such a just a backbone to the camp it just wouldn't have happened i have no way to express that it would not have happened the way that you witnessed it unfold without these that i mentioned and the ones the other ones that were that were mentioned um that i know that rachel might mention here in a second but i want to show you gideon bring those up just for a second um some of those photos we're gonna go through just a

just wanted to capture just a moment of that um play it pull up that video on the desktop of the swing giddy and i want to show you we had a giant one thing we had a giant swing and um those of you online i think there was a brother diggs had a wonderful part in his bonfire evening bonfire service and it was really good it was also on one side extremely hilarious he talked about um before you play that he talked about digestion you remember that young people and he talked about being constipated spiritually and he talked about having gas spiritually well i'm up there giving that testimony i find out that as well the streaming audience when i got up there and the streaming audience had never didn't wasn't at the bonfire obviously and apparently when i was up there streaming on sunday morning i walked up and said i hope none of y'all are constipated this morning and then the string the stream cut out right then so all of you that were watching there was a purpose behind me saying that i wasn't just asking that question so uh but it was just so wonderful there was there was a also this was on the stream and this was the swing was for all the kids and i did this travis did this everyone did it was an awesome awesome time i want to show you what happens when full-grown men go ahead and play that getting with lots of volume when full-grown men get on the swing they become little boys this brother john horniak there brother louise is videoing and brother danny torres look at that face all right going higher watch this face from brother danny [Laughter] brother john's about to lose some breakfast [Applause] let's do it again all right you can take that down gideon yep brother danny torres is now viral in the message those are just a few things and i hope that i didn't miss any testimonies that came in brother jason read some of those um my there were so many more names now those are just the ones that i mentioned because that's who i was with in the chapel there's others i'm gonna give just rachel just a second to say something i'm not like mad i'm not good at talking in front of people but if i was gonna say something it would be that i noticed that everybody that had a part in helping gave 200 percent they wore 50 different hats it wasn't ever one person having one job it was every single person did the job of 50 and it was everybody who helped and that that's what made the camp work the way that it did but two people that i would say just well maybe three people deb she's humble so she's she's gonna pretend like it was nothing but she literally stayed in that chapel and played music the entire time i hardly saw her at all we all really didn't see her she played the piano and required practice for specials for specials for church hours and hours and hours and then on top of that she was a counselor and she was running back and forth and everybody who was there knows that it was no short distance to that chapel she ran back and forth the whole time and with a joyful spirit more than anything the whole time anytime you try to compliment her say deb you're doing so much she'd be like oh no it was nothing i the lord did it for me because i i was so and then another one was amy we can all agree that when we were in there amy was like the brain of the entire thing and she was so tired but every time we had a question we knew that amy would have the answer so we started just asking her everything even things that other people would know it was like amy amy and she was just like pumping out the answers and she was just she was our fearless leader i think all of us would say that so that really appreciate that and another one i really want to say she's not here is abby abby stayed in that that um registration room whatever you call it the entire time with us she the t-shirts i was in charge of handing out the t-shirts would have been an absolute disaster if abby would not i mean the lord knew i kept telling every i got it i got it i can do it it's not going to be that hard i got a system the lord knew that if abby smith would not have walked in when she did and she just stood up beside me said i'm going to help you it would have been a disaster it would have been utter chaos and she was there the whole time she helped us with really everything the concessions everything and she's i consider her a young person she should have been out there with everybody enjoying it but she the whole time the whole time she was in there helping i think with everything so make sure she goes back and watches this so that she knows i said that about her um but so many helped i think so many i just can't even say but those are the the ones that come to my mind that i wanted to say yeah there was so so so many um names that i'm just going through my list here of people that um uh were helped in such a way sister chastity's here and brother doug's out of town and i can't tell you and i wasn't even there for most of it but i watched as sister chastity was just working working working brother doug working working working brother doug took three trips to costco three in a day i can't imagine going to costco one time man he went three times and was just tirelessly tirelessly working just constantly whatever he could do he was in charge of the mass texting app that we had one more thing i want to say i forgot the skit deb wrote that skit and it was unbelievable and it was inspired i can tell you that much she put a lot of time into it and chastity helped and um but the young people our young people got out there that's not easy being a teenager and getting up in front of 300 kids and doing any sort of acting i would not have done it and they did it and they pulled through they did such a good job they all knew their lines they probably it took time away from the swing to even go into the skip practice i think but they did it and it was such a hit amongst everybody at the camp and that i admire that that to me i'm so thankful that they even said that they would do that yeah yeah we had so many i just want to make sure we don't miss any but so many just said what can we do what can we do to help brother doug sister chastity got there thursday night and we're up with brother brad sister sarah jason amy me rachel tony amber till i forget how late we were up that night it wasn't that nice was the next day and every night but that day just just in that room constantly working and uh others that weren't even brother tony who's not here and i hate that but brother tony was just a backbone of the camp and was there for worship leading and uh the entire time their first song for for security helping the deacons helping brother jason helping me help in any way that he could um was just tirelessly giving of himself in any possible way that he could he was crucial brother don gurgle also and these are just the ones who help from our church there's many that help from other churches and we just want with their streaming online thank you for the the the labor and putting your shoulder to the will to help us uh with camp it we couldn't be it could not have been done without them uh brother brother don helping with deacon's brother brad told me he said man tell brother dawn he did such a wonderful job conducting that prayer line saturday night brother don was just faithful and the the lord is using the gift that he's placed in his life and it was just so wonderful i hope we're not missing anybody if we are we just want to say thank you uh to everybody the music team um thank you the music team sister amber also who's here tonight um my goodness just helped and and and and i know that she doesn't like me to and none of these sisters like this at all but i just want to make sure that they're recognized because of the the the months of planning and helping having meetings at their house hosting it and and the planning and the the just everything that went into it with her and brother uh brother tony brother travis sister deborah just so much labor i want to make sure i didn't miss any texts that came through here so much that so many helped with our music team uh that helped so much my brother chris i said aaron was a hit chris was a real hit with the whole camp and uh best i remember brother william andes came out and said brother matt he said i don't know if you realize recognize how good your music crew is here i feel like i'm playing with the gaither vocal bands choir music band yeah and chris was the announcer for the skit yeah yeah who was the who was the announcer so uh and the the drums the the labor that they put in the transport of all of that uh and for chris they were there for hours you know you watch those services chris and aaron and debra and brother steven curtis brother um peter or who who was it brother nate morris who also helped with that they were sitted behind the curtain that's where they got to have church because there was no seats so they just sat behind the curtain and enjoyed what they could and that's how they were also out there so fast when brother john called for him right behind the curtain the musicians uh who were there uh was just wonderful so i hope i didn't exhaust you with that but i just wanted to make sure that everyone was recognized and i'm gonna feel so horrible if i forgot somebody brother brad sister sarah i know they're not here so we forget about them but i can't tell you how crucial they were in all of the planning stages helping us they've hosted they've been helped with youth camps for years we consider them the the veterans amongst us and consulting with them and brother brad and sister sarah being head of the counselor team and and the deacon brother brother brad headed up the deacon team and just just there was such god's in god's family is the best people in the whole planet and it's just such a pleasure to work with them i want to say thank you to all of those part of bethel tabernacle who didn't go but you were praying for us we wanted to say thank you god really answered and heard prayers i believe this weekend let's all stand to our feet let's give the lord jesus one more handclap of praise amen amen isn't that wonderful we uh we're already starting to make some everybody was taking notes and as good as this one went we want to even try to improve it for the next year so we're going to have some brainstorming on all of that i just want to you know for me it was it's hard to describe how comforting it is to know that you have qualified good dependable people in the positions where you know it's like like these military pilots that fly these jets and they have a weapons called fire and forget and they just they aim it they lock it on they fire it and they go on to another target they know that missile will go do its job and there were so many moments that i had a pause to go oh wonder if this oh what about that and i thought wait a minute i got people yeah okay they got oh yeah there's brother sister so-and-so brother sister so i got it yeah and and every time that happened to me i was so aware that who i had handling that would handle it better than me and and it was just remarkable i appreciated uh having my son at the head of all of that it was comforting to know that i had one person that i could just say hey matt what about this what about that and if he didn't know the answer he had people that could get him the answer and so it just but every department head every worker everybody that was involved it was it was just remarkable but most of all we want to thank the lord god we want to say thank you jesus amen lord thank you yup okay one thing brother travis just reminded me of i want to make sure we said this because this was really profound look up lodge where we had the camp where we're going to have it next year same date same time same place and they host all through the year summer camps i forget how many multiple churches they host i mean it's constantly hosting church after church after church after church and the director's name is zach and zach said something brother brad when him brother johnson were having a conversation and he just said i just want to tell you guys he said man we deal with a lot of religious people at this camp and he said but i've never seen any group ever have the kind of spirit that your people has he said it's the best spirit out of any group we've ever worked with hallelujah amen amen that's what the word produces the word produces that kind of a crop every time we had of this being a wednesday night i had a number of prayer requests come in i'm going to post them to our church whatsapp i'm going to read them to you right here
