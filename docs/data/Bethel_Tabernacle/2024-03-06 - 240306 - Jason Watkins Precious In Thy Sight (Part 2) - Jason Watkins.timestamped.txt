[34:43] those who are different those who are
[34:47] not the world those who are not like the
[34:53] world Amen praise the Lord and so
[34:58] you know he that he that's who he's
[35:00] talking to Grace be unto you and peace
[35:03] from God our Father and you know it's
[35:06] interesting that this grace and peace
[35:09] he's not saying you know uh grace and
[35:13] grace and peace unto you from Wells
[35:17] Fargo
[35:19] bank because you got a lot of money in
[35:21] your bank Grace and peace unto you from
[35:24] Mark Zuckerberg because you got a lot of
[35:26] friends
[35:28] it's not what he's saying it's not Grace
[35:30] and peace from the White
[35:33] House I just want to make this point
[35:35] there's no Grace and peace except coming
[35:38] by Jesus Christ yes amen amen amen all
[35:42] right so Sunday we had read this this
[35:47] quote from an
[35:49] absolute and brother brandom I just want
[35:51] to read it again just for a
[35:54] refresher brother brandham said there
[35:56] was no profits in them days you remember
[35:58] how that we took the text out of the Old
[36:01] Testament where where there was no open
[36:04] Vision in the days of Samuel when he was
[36:06] just a boy in the days of Eli you
[36:08] remember that and it said the word of
[36:10] God was precious the word of the Lord
[36:13] was precious because it was rare now I
[36:18] I'll promise you this it's it was less
[36:21] rare then than it is now see right now
[36:26] we have a more sure word of Prophecy
[36:29] Amen in the word of God we have the
[36:32] Messiah we have his understanding we
[36:35] have the death burial and Resurrection
[36:38] We Now understand things the disciples
[36:40] did not understand at that even when
[36:42] Jesus was there right so we have when
[36:46] John come back from the aisle of patmas
[36:49] he had a further revelation of things
[36:52] that the church clearly had no
[36:55] understanding of before the Holy Ghost
[36:58] experience in the upper room and then
[37:00] Paul comes along and starts setting the
[37:02] church in order and then when John comes
[37:05] back everything he brings everybody is
[37:08] able to tie them together with what Paul
[37:11] has taught them to say goodness look
[37:15] at a revelation of Jesus Christ and
[37:18] here's his description and I'll be if
[37:20] that's not exactly what Paul described
[37:23] him as and then it goes in starts to
[37:25] describe the church that we are he hath
[37:28] made us Kings and Priests my goodness
[37:31] and the whole church is saying can you
[37:33] imagine that John would go to the aisle
[37:35] of patmas for two years and when he
[37:37] comes back the the one that spoke to him
[37:40] agreed with everything the messenger has
[37:43] already told us that's a beautiful thing
[37:45] friends that's why to me this message is
[37:48] so beautiful today because it's so
[37:51] agrees with everything I already knew in
[37:54] the Bible and then the things I didn't
[37:55] understand it all makes sense and ties
[37:57] all together I'm going to tell you
[37:59] something friends we today have a seven
[38:02] course meal now having said that in
[38:07] perfect contrast you have the prophecy
[38:11] that at the end time there would be a
[38:14] famine for hearing the word of God so
[38:18] not a famine of the word of God but a
[38:21] famine of hearing the word of God and
[38:24] you say well that doesn't make sense
[38:26] because this is the 21st century and
[38:29] we've got it digitized and it's going
[38:31] all over the world in every language and
[38:33] it's went to every country and it's on
[38:35] the internet and it's on it's on this
[38:37] site and that site and this site and
[38:39] that site and it's being spread
[38:40] everywhere how is there a famine for
[38:42] hearing the word there's a famine for
[38:45] people
[38:47] willing to hear the word so now it turns
[38:51] back again you are rare yes amen you now
[38:57] if you're rare then you know what that
[39:00] makes you
[39:02] precious in His sight because you you
[39:06] rare bunch of people you one in a
[39:09] million you have believed his word and
[39:12] that makes him love you and you are
[39:15] precious in His
[39:19] sight but the world has turned a deaf
[39:22] ear and the Bible said they would do
[39:25] that they would Heap to themselves
[39:26] teachers having itching ears they
[39:28] wouldn't want to hear the word of God
[39:31] anymore they they they the the people
[39:35] who don't listen to the word of God
[39:39] don't listen to it because they don't
[39:43] want
[39:45] to people who don't come to church don't
[39:49] come because they don't want
[39:51] to people who have left churches and
[39:55] stay at home on purpose and have S have
[39:58] have given up a local church and a local
[40:01] Ministry a local live pastor and they've
[40:04] stopped coming to church and stop
[40:06] fellowshipping with the Saints the
[40:08] reason they've done that is because
[40:10] that's what they wanted to do and
[40:13] somebody told them it was okay and they
[40:15] took
[40:17] it but I still believe what Paul said
[40:20] that as you see the day approaching you
[40:22] ought to assemble
[40:24] more Let Your Love abound abound amen
[40:29] this is the time where love must abound
[40:32] Faith must abound now if that's true do
[40:35] we believe it do we accept
[40:37] it then then then don't hold it against
[40:41] God if he has to take measures to make
[40:45] sure that you're growing along at
[40:49] pace so we finished Sunday well we
[40:52] didn't finish it but we read this quote
[40:54] in part one he says there was no
[40:56] Prophets in them days to stand to the
[40:59] word and direct Israel so the word
[41:01] wasn't coming so every man did what was
[41:03] right in his own sight and that's about
[41:05] what we where we've gotten to to uh to
[41:08] again today Brethren see every man in
[41:11] his own sight see uh well I want to take
[41:15] the Golden Rule I want to do this you
[41:17] know some religion I believe my religion
[41:20] uh is do so and so and you find that
[41:22] everybody finds that God's he says now
[41:25] God's Got Away amen amen now you'd have
[41:29] confidence in it if God's got it
[41:31] right the B but the Bible also says
[41:35] there is a way now this is obviously
[41:37] another way there is a way that Seth
[41:40] right unto a man but the end thereof is
[41:42] the way of death and there's nobody
[41:44] wants to die that's separation we don't
[41:46] want to be separated from God we want to
[41:49] live life is the greatest treasure that
[41:51] man can have and now we've got to find
[41:54] what is life and he said he's going to
[41:56] answer question his own question my word
[42:00] is life that's the life that you should
[42:03] have the word living in
[42:11] you so we talked about the problem now
[42:17] we are coming to the book of Philippians
[42:20] because we don't just need a problem we
[42:22] need an answer amen all right so when we
[42:27] look here in Philippians in our very
[42:29] oops in our very first
[42:33] verse we find I Paul and Timothy the
[42:37] Servants of Jesus Christ to all the
[42:41] saints in Christ Jesus
[42:45] now this these this wording here uh let
[42:49] let me read it to you like this with
[42:50] some help from the Amplified Bible Paul
[42:54] and Timothy the servants the
[42:58] attendants the helpers of Jesus Christ
[43:02] in his
[43:03] ministry you know to all the saints the
[43:08] all the set aside ones the word has very
[43:12] little effect on people who are not
[43:15] willing to be set aside for service but
[43:19] I just want to say to you tonight please
[43:22] don't allow uh any type of resentment or
[43:27] anger or offense or bitterness rise in
[43:32] your hearts at the preaching of the
[43:34] gospel because we're only his
[43:39] helpers please when you think of brother
[43:42] Jason just remember and if what I say
[43:45] offends you just say well he's just the
[43:47] Lord's helper I'm not here I've never
[43:50] been here I've never used this desk you
[43:53] know to try to to try to dominate over
[43:56] people it's not about that it's that's
[43:59] that's the need Deeds of the nicians and
[44:02] the Lord hates that and I hate it and
[44:03] you hate it and we hate it amen amen so
[44:07] we are the Servants of the lord we are
[44:09] his attendants we are his helpers where
[44:14] we read on down we find in verse four or
[44:19] let's get verse three a going into four
[44:22] I thank my
[44:24] God upon every remembrance of you always
[44:30] in every prayer of mine for you all
[44:35] making requests with joy
[44:39] now that Paul can do anything with joy
[44:43] is
[44:46] astonishing I mean you know people who
[44:49] get feeling sorry for themselves just
[44:51] remember that Paul talks about and he
[44:55] says you know I've I've been robbed of
[44:58] my
[44:59] countrymen beaten many times many
[45:02] stripes twice he said I had the 40
[45:05] Lashes save one the same one Jesus had
[45:08] Paul had twice he's been he said I've
[45:10] been robbed I've been hungry I've been
[45:12] naked I've been he said I spent a day
[45:14] and a night in the Deep because we were
[45:16] 14 days in a ship in a gale and we even
[45:19] despaired of life and then the ship was
[45:21] crashed and I spent a night and a day in
[45:23] the Deep I even despaired of Life yes
[45:26] amen so you know here's Paul he's
[45:30] rejected he's in prisoned he gets out
[45:32] he's put back he you know he's he's he's
[45:35] Chained and and and and he's he's a he's
[45:38] constantly stoned and he's been stoned
[45:41] numerous times and and left for
[45:43] dead so you know if you break a
[45:47] spiritual fingernail get over
[45:51] it if you stop your spiritual toe just
[45:54] get over it amen because here is Paul
[45:58] saying you know after everything he's
[46:00] been through I pray for you I pray the
[46:04] prayer of mind for you all making
[46:06] requests with joy he's not even saying I
[46:09] request Joy or or I request for you Joy
[46:13] he said I request with joy amen so the
[46:19] fact that Paul can do anything with joy
[46:21] and in fact is as he goes on down in
[46:24] that chapter it's going to be more and
[46:26] and more astonishing with what he says
[46:29] over the next number of verses however
[46:32] by the time hopefully we get to verse 20
[46:35] and 21 the end of our opening text uh
[46:38] you're going to see the
[46:40] secret to it all amen you want a
[46:43] secret Lord they they say that if you
[46:47] want somebody's undivided
[46:50] attention laser focus you lean in and
[46:55] Whisper I shouldn't be telling you
[47:00] this I promise you they will drop
[47:04] everything they will lay their phone
[47:09] down so I'm going to we're going to get
[47:12] to Paul's secret that how that in
[47:15] everything he could still have
[47:18] joy when we come to verse
[47:23] S even as it is meat for me or good for
[47:27] me to think this of you all because I
[47:30] have you in my heart in as much as both
[47:34] in my bonds and in the defense and
[47:37] confirmation of the Gospel look what
[47:39] I've got to underline ye all are
[47:42] partakers of my grace in other words
[47:46] he's saying to the church you share in
[47:49] my afflictions you share in my hardships
[47:54] you share in my bonds
[47:57] and guess what it's all partaking of
[48:01] Grace so I just want to encourage you
[48:04] here on a Wednesday night I know there's
[48:06] all kinds of buns and there's all kinds
[48:09] of hardships and there's all kinds of
[48:11] afflictions but there's joy because
[48:14] there's
[48:15] Grace and I'm just more than happy to
[48:17] say I will take my stand with the Lord's
[48:20] despise
[48:25] few
[48:28] Peter Peter talks about this in First
[48:34] Peter chapter 1 verses
[48:40] 3-7 and he says blessed be the God and
[48:43] father of our Lord Jesus Christ which
[48:46] according to His abundant uh excuse me
[48:50] yeah according to His abundant Mercy
[48:53] hath begotten us again unto a life ly
[48:57] Hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ
[49:02] from the dead so now I want you to
[49:05] realize that we have been begotten again
[49:09] unto a lively hope not a lively dread
[49:13] not a lively depression there's no such
[49:16] thing see we have we have been given he
[49:20] goes on to say watch this to an
[49:25] inheritance incorrupt
[49:27] able and undefiled and I will say to you
[49:30] quite
[49:34] undefiled not a way reserved in heaven

[55:03] Rejoice oh my we found out the other
[55:06] service that sons of Zion are more
[55:08] valuable than gold that
[55:12] lovely so Paul I'm sorry Peter carrying
[55:16] on in Peter we're coming to verse nine
[55:19] now this is the whis translation with a
[55:23] little bit of uh little bit of little
[55:26] bit of flavor that I've added to it of
[55:28] my own just I'm just adding it for
[55:30] clarity but this is largely I want to
[55:32] give credit where credits to this is
[55:34] largely from the whis translation very
[55:35] wonderful translation brother JD's
[55:38] father-in-law uh turned me on to verse
[55:42] nine my Earnest prayer this is Peter for
[55:45] the church my Earnest prayer namely is
[55:49] that your love divine in its nature
[55:53] might more and more overflow amen see
[55:57] but at the same time being kept within
[56:00] the guiding limitations of God's word
[56:03] that's directly from the
[56:05] Weis let's look at it again here's my
[56:08] Earnest prayer Peter is saying this is
[56:10] the same guy who's let you know you're
[56:11] going to get Fiery trials they're
[56:13] they're more precious than gold you
[56:15] should Rejoice see my Earnest prayer
[56:19] namely is that your love divine in its
[56:21] nature so it's not human remember it's
[56:24] not a love for God it's the love of God
[56:26] amen
[56:28] right that your love divine in its
[56:32] nature might more and more so it sounds
[56:36] like trials and things to perfect you're
[56:38] going to keep coming and keep
[56:40] coming one yeah I got one
[56:44] yeah
[56:47] Rejoice see here's why so that your love
[56:51] divine in its nature might more and more
[56:55] overflow
[56:57] love isn't a whole lot of value if it's
[56:59] not
[57:01] active you know brother Steve wrote the
[57:03] song The Lazy Light Keeper the light was
[57:05] burning bright within but it it wasn't
[57:08] reaching out sit on the lens a lot of
[57:11] good it did to have light inside it
[57:13] couldn't reach out and didn't save the
[57:14] captain see so that your love more and
[57:18] more
[57:19] overflow but at the same time be kept
[57:23] within the guiding limitations of God's
[57:25] word remember in that this guiding
[57:28] knowledge was ministered to you by the
[57:31] Holy Spirit there's lots of ministering
[57:35] spirits in the world there's one holy
[57:40] spirit so which one do you want to be
[57:43] ministered to there's a there's millions
[57:47] of spirits to anoint you and Lead You
[57:51] and influence you and inform your
[57:54] thinking but there's one Holy Spirit and
[57:58] it's the love of God and it's divine in
[58:00] its nature see and you're but but but
[58:04] it's not you know it's it's uh he says

[58:10] next one yeah so so he's he's bringing
[58:14] this here uh let me get to where I want
[58:16] to be so that your
[58:18] love divine in its nature uh Eugene
[58:23] Peterson in his message translation of
[58:25] the New Testament he says so that your
[58:28] love not sentimental
[58:33] gush see not sentimental gush you still
[58:37] have to identify and call Sin
[58:41] Sin and that ain't that don't that don't
[58:43] mean you go on a street corner and do it
[58:45] and it don't mean that you you just you

[59:02] experience so don't do that love one
[59:05] another pray for one another sometimes
[59:09] opinions however good they might be are
[59:10] Best Kept to
[59:12] yourself and you wonder why people don't
[59:15] like you so much that there's a reason
[59:17] for that amen so whoever that helps
[59:20] praise the Lord might be somebody online
[59:23] amen
[59:25] amen it was free Amen brother Luther
[59:28] amen that wasn't in my
[59:31] notes but not sentimental gush just live
[59:35] your life let your light so shine That
[59:39] Others May see it was remember friends
[59:42] it is the lighthouse on the on the hill
[59:44] but it's the Lower Lights it's the Lower
[59:47] Lights because that's where many a
[59:49] shipwreck has happened that even when
[59:51] the lighthouse was shining a big beam
[59:53] because the the channel was narrow and
[59:56] shallows they had men that go down along
[59:59] the bank with Lower Lights that's why
[1:00:00] the song let the Lower Lights be
[1:00:04] burning send a beam across the way that
[1:00:07] some poor wayfaring seman you may rescue
[1:00:11] you may save sister Jean used to sing
[1:00:14] that in younger days my looking forward
[1:00:17] to hear singing it
[1:00:21] again so my Earnest prayer namely is
[1:00:24] that your love divine and it nature
[1:00:26] might more and more overflow but at the
[1:00:29] same time be kept within the guiding
[1:00:32] limitations of God's word remembering
[1:00:35] that this guiding knowledge was
[1:00:37] ministered to you by the Holy Spirit you
[1:00:39] cannot help anyone by letting down the
[1:00:41] bars and doing it in the Name of Love
[1:00:44] that's not love that's at least that's
[1:00:47] not Divine love that might be
[1:00:49] sentimental
[1:00:51] gush and you might be sentimentally
[1:00:54] gushing on on everybody that really
[1:00:56] needs to see a a life of a Christian out
[1:00:59] of you and it would do them a whole lot
[1:01:01] better than you just gushing all the
[1:01:05] time and just trying to be you know just
[1:01:08] just never never living in a way never
[1:01:11] having anything in your life that
[1:01:13] confronts the world and makes them think
[1:01:16] and second guess that maybe they need
[1:01:18] more than they
[1:01:21] have see brother brandham when he talks
[1:01:24] about the sman age
[1:01:27] and um brother Brenham said you know
[1:01:30] he's covering
[1:01:34] Revelation
[1:01:36] tribulation brother brandham says now
[1:01:38] the Lord God Almighty says I
[1:01:41] know there he is walking in the midst of
[1:01:44] his people there he is the chief
[1:01:47] Shepherd of the flock but does he hold
[1:01:50] back the
[1:01:51] persecution does he stem the tribulation
[1:01:55] no
[1:01:56] he does not he simply says I know your
[1:02:00] tribulation I'm not at all unmindful of
[1:02:04] your
[1:02:05] suffering just remember that friends
[1:02:08] when it feels like you you're suffering
[1:02:10] you can't get a prayer to go higher than
[1:02:12] your 9- foot ceiling just remember he's
[1:02:14] not
[1:02:15] unmindful at all he's
[1:02:19] aware what a stumbling block that is to
[1:02:23] so many people m yes amen like Israel
[1:02:28] they wondered if God really loves them
[1:02:32] how can God be just and loving if he
[1:02:34] stands by and watches his people suffer
[1:02:39] this is what they ask him in Malachi 1
[1:02:42] the burden of the word of the lord of
[1:02:45] the Lord to Israel by
[1:02:49] Malachi I have loved you sayith the Lord
[1:02:54] yet you say wait wherein hast thou loved
[1:02:57] us now if you go back and you read that
[1:02:59] in Malachi he go they're they're asking
[1:03:01] the Lord look you don't you know we're
[1:03:03] suffering do you understand that you
[1:03:06] understand that we're a nation we're
[1:03:07] under conflict we're under military rule
[1:03:09] we got all these things going on and you
[1:03:11] say you love us and yet we've been
[1:03:13] invaded and everything and the Lord
[1:03:15] doesn't deny any of that in fact is he's
[1:03:17] the one who hired pharaoh to come in
[1:03:20] after him he's the one who hired uh
[1:03:22] Nebuchadnezzar he's the one who hired
[1:03:24] all these Kings and all their armies to
[1:03:26] go in and spank his
[1:03:29] children he doesn't he doesn't try to
[1:03:31] disavow himself of that see but he
[1:03:35] simply you know what you know what he
[1:03:36] you know how he proves he says you say
[1:03:38] wherein hast thou loved us and he says
[1:03:42] really was was
[1:03:45] not Jacob and Esau and yet I said before
[1:03:50] either were ever born that that Jacob
[1:03:53] have I loved and Esau have I hated
[1:03:56] am so God's love is proven in election
[1:04:01] in that he elected you see so so he he
[1:04:05] go he goes on brother brandham says you
[1:04:08] see they could not figure out God's love
[1:04:12] they thought that love meant no
[1:04:15] suffering they thought that love meant a
[1:04:17] baby with parental care but God said
[1:04:21] that he his love was elective love amen
[1:04:25] so this isn't sentimental gush like you
[1:04:28] would gush over a baby or like you would
[1:04:31] never have any kind of a thing that you
[1:04:34] don't want to offend you know you're
[1:04:36] you're the only light your family might
[1:04:38] see you're the only light your neighbors
[1:04:40] might see you're the only light your
[1:04:42] business associates might see but but we
[1:04:45] we don't want to offend anybody so all
[1:04:47] we do is just gush human gushing
[1:04:51] sentiment but I'm here to tell you
[1:04:53] something friends the love of God
[1:04:56] the real love of God is given by the
[1:04:59] Holy
[1:05:01] Spirit and and and so it comes down and
[1:05:04] that's why we kept asking you Sunday you
[1:05:07] know is this word
[1:05:11] precious amen the Eugene Peterson says
[1:05:16] verse n like this so this is my
[1:05:19] prayer that your love will flourish and
[1:05:23] that you will not only love much but
[1:05:25] love
[1:05:27] well learn to love
[1:05:31] appropriately so we're learning
[1:05:33] something tonight aren't we it's not the
[1:05:35] care it's not the care of a baby it's
[1:05:38] not that's not the kind of love he's
[1:05:39] talking about it's it's elective love
[1:05:43] it's a holy love it's a it's a divine
[1:05:46] nature love Jesus was loving the people
[1:05:50] just as much when he platted a whip
[1:05:53] together and ran them out of the Temple
[1:05:55] Le and whipped them and over overturned
[1:05:58] their money tables he loved them just as
[1:06:00] much doing that as he did when he was
[1:06:02] raising their
[1:06:04] dead just as much as when he was had a
[1:06:07] Social Services Program going and was
[1:06:10] feeding the
[1:06:12] poor he loved them just as much see and
[1:06:18] so they couldn't figure out God's love
[1:06:21] but he Peterson says so this is my
[1:06:24] prayer that your love will flourish and
[1:06:26] that you will not only love much but
[1:06:28] love well learn to love
[1:06:34] appropriately coming back to the whis
[1:06:36] translation for verse
[1:06:38] 10 so that going forward so in other
[1:06:42] words in other words Your Love needs to
[1:06:44] be
[1:06:47] appropriate are we rejoicing Your Love
[1:06:50] needs to be
[1:06:51] appropriate so that going forward by
[1:06:54] God's word
[1:06:56] you recognize you identify and you
[1:06:59] manifest the value of divine
[1:07:02] distinctions in true Christian conduct
[1:07:06] so that you might be unadulterated by
[1:07:09] evil and thus pure and not a stumbling
[1:07:13] block till the coming of the
[1:07:17] Lord this is what Peter's his his sermon
[1:07:21] is trying to get us to understand
[1:07:24] sometimes we go through Tri s sometimes
[1:07:26] they're fiery they're more precious than
[1:07:28] gold they sometimes we're suffering but
[1:07:32] just like Paul said even in Paul all of
[1:07:34] his suffering Paul prayed with
[1:07:37] joy the the recommendation of the Bible
[1:07:40] is that we Rejoice even if right now we
[1:07:43] have to go through something to perfect
[1:07:45] us even if I got to go through something
[1:07:48] hard that makes me more valuable than
[1:07:49] gold that perisheth that that because
[1:07:52] it's molding my divine nature it's teach
[1:07:55] teaching me to love
[1:07:57] appropriately I mean it's making you a
[1:08:00] super weapon for the law for God to use
[1:08:03] for your family don't resist
[1:08:06] it it's the best medicine your lost
[1:08:09] loved ones can ever encounter is you
[1:08:12] having come through the school of trial
[1:08:16] and tribulation and yet you loved God
[1:08:18] and you kept
[1:08:20] going and you became more
[1:08:23] precious than gold that
[1:08:28] perishes so that going forward by God's
[1:08:32] word I love
[1:08:34] that this is a bunch of stuff you
[1:08:37] recognize you identify and you
[1:08:42] manifest the value of divine
[1:08:46] distinctions I'm glad this is this is
[1:08:48] coming out of the Bible this isn't me to
[1:08:50] St here saying you need to be different
[1:08:52] than the
[1:08:53] world th this flies in in the face of
[1:08:56] modern Christianity who just says it
[1:08:58] doesn't matter and we're all alike we're
[1:09:01] not oh it doesn't matter oh it matters
[1:09:05] people are going to find out on
[1:09:06] Resurrection morning how much it matters
[1:09:08] they're going to find out at the day of
[1:09:09] judgment when they're in the tribulation
[1:09:12] they're going to find out wow I guess it
[1:09:13] mattered don't wait till then and guess
[1:09:15] it mattered understand now it
[1:09:20] matters that and thus pure and not a
[1:09:24] stumbling block
[1:09:26] till the coming of the Lord you know I
[1:09:30] think about the kind of love
[1:09:32] that hady Wright had for her
[1:09:35] children and we you know we went into
[1:09:38] this a little bit on Sunday and and I
[1:09:40] could I could I could feel things
[1:09:42] tightening up and people getting a
[1:09:45] little quiet because this gets down
[1:09:47] really close to where we
[1:09:49] live but to
[1:09:52] Haddie there was nothing more precious
[1:09:55] to her the greatest most precious desire
[1:10:00] of her heart was the salvation of her
[1:10:06] children she didn't have any money but
[1:10:09] that wasn't
[1:10:10] precious money wasn't precious to her
[1:10:13] she had sick family but and while she
[1:10:16] cared about them she certainly cared
[1:10:19] about them she certainly could have used
[1:10:21] money she certainly would love to see
[1:10:23] Edith be healed yeah her sister but you
[1:10:27] know what here's the thing Edith would
[1:10:29] die again
[1:10:30] anyway and then Haddie would die then
[1:10:32] what do you got so you've chased the
[1:10:35] world so you won the prize Well then
[1:10:37] what oh friends this love is divine Let
[1:10:41] Your Love be pure let it be let it be
[1:10:45] controlled by the Holy Ghost let it be
[1:10:48] appropriate see had he cared enough to
[1:10:52] live the kind of life in front of her
[1:10:54] boys and when she got the opportunity to
[1:10:57] have anything she wanted the most
[1:11:01] precious desire that God recognized and
[1:11:05] did the supernatural for was the love of
[1:11:09] a mother for her her unredeemed children
[1:11:13] I want to tell you something friends let
[1:11:14] every mother have that kind of faith
[1:11:16] today oh near and far because that's the
[1:11:20] thing that that God loved that because
[1:11:22] that's how he had been Hallelujah he
[1:11:25] spared no expense to save you and
[1:11:29] I right and so a lot of times it comes
[1:11:33] down to and hear me when I say I'm I'm
[1:11:37] I'm I'm gonna stop I'm trying to watch
[1:11:38] my time but listen let me let me come to
[1:11:42] this
[1:11:42] real um this point that I want to make
[1:11:46] sure we're not
[1:11:49] missing because it comes down to what is
[1:11:52] precious to
[1:11:54] you
[1:11:55] and a lot of times we find that the the
[1:11:59] problem can be is that the things that
[1:12:03] ought to be precious are valuable but
[1:12:06] they're not the most
[1:12:08] precious sometimes the example that
[1:12:12] parents ref they refuse to live that
[1:12:17] fervent life before their children and
[1:12:20] and and you know why they don't do that
[1:12:23] and it's not because they don't love
[1:12:25] their
[1:12:26] children it's because they love what
[1:12:29] they want to do
[1:12:35] more gold to my
[1:12:38] ear was the fourth prime minister of
[1:12:40] Israel she served from
[1:12:43] 1969 to
[1:12:48] 1974 in a speech one time uh before it
[1:12:51] was a journalist um journalist dinner
[1:12:56] and they had her there as a guest
[1:12:57] keynote speaker she started talking
[1:13:00] about the Arab Israeli conflict she made
[1:13:04] this gripping gripping gripping
[1:13:07] statement she's quite famous for
[1:13:10] it she says we can forgive the Arabs for
[1:13:15] killing our
[1:13:16] children we cannot forgive them for
[1:13:20] forcing us to kill their
[1:13:24] children
[1:13:27] we will only have peace with the Arabs
[1:13:30] when they love their children more than
[1:13:33] they hate
[1:13:35] us that's that takes my breath
[1:13:40] away what a statement look at it again
[1:13:43] we can forgive the Arabs for killing our
[1:13:45] children we cannot forgive them for
[1:13:48] forcing us to kill their
[1:13:50] children we will only have peace with
[1:13:52] the Arabs when they love their children
[1:13:56] more than they hate
[1:14:02] us so this kind of statement challenges
[1:14:07] us it challenges us tonight it was
[1:14:11] challenging us Sunday and it challenges
[1:14:13] us
[1:14:14] tonight to think about the root
[1:14:18] causes of and and the
[1:14:21] consequences of our actions and choices
[1:14:24] and consequence quences that that don't
[1:14:26] always turn out very
[1:14:28] good I made I made a mention of it
[1:14:31] Sunday and I didn't go on to it because
[1:14:33] I didn't want to get sidetracked into
[1:14:35] this
[1:14:36] material but you know I coming up on 30
[1:14:41] years pastoring here I'm in my fifth or
[1:14:43] sixth I counted up the other day I think
[1:14:45] I'm in my sixth
[1:14:47] generation of young people growing up
[1:14:52] I've got an intermediate age on uh 12 13
[1:14:56] 14 who are growing heading toward that
[1:14:59] becoming that senior I know the age
[1:15:01] limits I'm not talking about that I'm
[1:15:02] talking about where you really are part
[1:15:04] where you really are a senior youth
[1:15:07] where you're headed to that 16 17 18 19
[1:15:11] I'm going to tell you Mom and Dad if you
[1:15:14] haven't really really instilled a
[1:15:17] fervent love of God in the hearts of
[1:15:19] those children it's going to be very
[1:15:21] difficult to do once they get much older
[1:15:26] and I have stood in this pull pit and
[1:15:28] other buildings that we had before we
[1:15:30] had this building in 1999 stood in an
[1:15:33] aame that's no longer even there stood
[1:15:35] in a pull pit in Chessie standing in
[1:15:37] this pull pit for all these decades and
[1:15:40] I have and I have said to parents I know
[1:15:43] they look little and sweet and cute now
[1:15:47] and they're adorable and we love them
[1:15:50] but if you don't train them up in the
[1:15:52] way that they ought to go say brother
[1:15:54] Jason you're going to Hur the fing the
[1:15:55] some I can't help that because this has
[1:15:58] been a consistent message that I've
[1:16:00] given over and over again and I got now
[1:16:03] younger parents going to be having
[1:16:04] children and I got younger parents with
[1:16:07] little bitty children now and I know
[1:16:09] I've said it to every generation so I
[1:16:11] got to say it to this generation now
[1:16:13] listen I know they're sweet and cuddly
[1:16:16] now but they won't stay that
[1:16:19] way because you got to recognize they
[1:16:21] have a little sweet adorable Fallen
[1:16:24] nature
[1:16:27] and they're adorable now but if you
[1:16:29] don't bring listen you can't save them
[1:16:32] but what you can do is train them up the
[1:16:35] Bible doesn't say raise kids it says
[1:16:38] train
[1:16:39] them that's harder raising is just you
[1:16:43] you feed them you clothe them you
[1:16:44] shelter them you take them to school you
[1:16:47] take them to soccer you do do all that
[1:16:49] stuff that's not
[1:16:50] training that you're raising children
[1:16:52] but the Bible says train up a child
[1:16:56] and the reason I'm preaching this again
[1:16:59] for the sixth generation is I don't want
[1:17:01] to come to another generation of 16 17
[1:17:05] 18 19 20 year olds and they're out in
[1:17:08] the world or their life is filled with
[1:17:11] carnality that's not what the message
[1:17:14] came
[1:17:17] for and it's you say oh my goodness mine
[1:17:20] are already that age is it too late
[1:17:23] thank God no as long as Christ is still
[1:17:26] on the throne oh I'm here to tell you
[1:17:29] something friends God still honors Faith
[1:17:32] you can turn things around if you start
[1:17:34] today and it doesn't have to take you
[1:17:36] that long because the Jesus
[1:17:40] multiplies oh I used to say that a lot
[1:17:42] back in the day I haven't said it in a
[1:17:44] long time listen if he only added and
[1:17:46] subtracted then if you spent 20 years
[1:17:48] serving the devil Jesus would need 20
[1:17:51] years to get you cleaned up fortunately
[1:17:54] he multip
[1:17:55] supplies and he can take 10 years 20
[1:17:58] years 30 years of upside down life and
[1:18:00] in a moment turn it
[1:18:02] around I'm here to tell you something
[1:18:04] friends I was talking to a brother
[1:18:05] recently and I said listen when you get
[1:18:08] a body change that's not the first time
[1:18:10] something will happen to you in a moment
[1:18:13] in the twinkling of an eye it also
[1:18:15] happens at a new birth in a moment in
[1:18:17] the twinkling of an eye you are born
[1:18:21] again the body is only continuing the
[1:18:24] process process
[1:18:27] amen it challenges us to think about the
[1:18:31] consequences of our actions and the root
[1:18:33] causes and the root causes there's
[1:18:35] really only
[1:18:37] one at the
[1:18:39] root there's really only one singular
[1:18:41] cause at the heart of it and Jesus pins
[1:18:44] it on this trying to serve God and yet
[1:18:47] love the things of the world at the same
[1:18:51] time and he makes it clear that you
[1:18:53] cannot do both at the same time those
[1:18:56] things are mutually exclusive they those
[1:18:58] two things cannot both be true about
[1:19:02] you there are things that are not mut
[1:19:05] mutually exclusive and they both things
[1:19:07] can actually be true at the same time
[1:19:09] this ain't one of them either you love
[1:19:12] one and ha and hate the other or love
[1:19:15] this one and hate this one amen you
[1:19:17] can't serve God in the world it's
[1:19:20] impossible and so you know they we we
[1:19:23] find you know because
[1:19:25] where if you want if you want
[1:19:27] consequences if you want to make it
[1:19:28] plural now you can get into into plural
[1:19:31] by the many bad outcomes and the
[1:19:34] devastating

[1:21:27] Holy Ghost and give them eternal life
[1:21:30] that their lives bring glory to God that
[1:21:34] they make Heaven their home who could
[1:21:38] not want that for their

[1:23:24] didn't shut me up they gave me a
[1:23:26] platform alive I'm Christ's messenger

[1:29:26] unequivocally on duty you're working for
[1:29:29] the king no time for pleasure or
[1:29:32] pandering cut the head off of the devil

[1:29:38] of the enemy under your control through
[1:29:40] the Holy Ghost how many will pray that
[1:29:43] that'll be the effect of our brothers
[1:29:45] offer him no quarter except no surrender
[1:29:49] or treaty he must be destroyed in the
[1:29:51] lives of God's family as sister Mr
[1:29:54] Brenda Lewis wrote You've been given
[1:29:56] full Authority and Power in his name the
[1:29:58] greatest mission of any church is to go
[1:30:01] or send someone I sent them this quote
[1:30:05] from Thomas Jackson Stonewall
[1:30:07] Jackson he says War means
[1:30:11] fighting the business of the soldier is
[1:30:14] to fight armies are not called out to
[1:30:17] dig trenches to throw up breastworks to
[1:30:20] live in camps but to find the enemy and
[1:30:23] strike him to invade his country and do
[1:30:26] him all possible damage in the shortest
[1:30:29] possible time this will involve Great
[1:30:32] destruction of life and property while
[1:30:34] it lasts but such a war will of
[1:30:37] necessity be of brief continuance and so
[1:30:40] would be an economy of life and property
[1:30:45] in the
[1:30:46] End Amen I just wanted to send them with
[1:30:51] courage you know when we say take the
