[0:00] So,
[0:02] or that the revelation's never been
[0:04] quickened yet.
[0:05] It's just head knowledge. That's fine. A
[0:08] person can go to be lost and go to hell
[0:10] with head knowledge. I wouldn't suggest
[0:12] we shouldn't have head knowledge, but we
[0:14] shouldn't also limit it only to that. It
[0:17] must come forth from our life. It has to
[0:20] go from our head to our heart to where
[0:22] it affects our entire being. Or as
[0:24] brother Brandham would say, it's not
[0:26] enough to be anointed in the spirit or
[0:28] on the flesh. We have to have that seed
[0:31] gene of God in our life. And that has to
[0:33] be quickened to life. And when that's
[0:35] quickened to life, there's a certain
[0:38] nature attribute. There's a certain
[0:40] function that is produced in our life
[0:42] that lines up with the life of Christ.
[0:44] And so I want to turn to First Peter
[0:46] chapter 1. That's sort of my foundation
[0:49] for looking into this. We're not trying
[0:52] to
[0:53] to turn us backwards or go to some other
[0:56] live in the glare of another age. We
[0:58] want to live in the glow.
[1:02] Amen.
[1:03] The the overflowing light of the word
[1:06] manifested in this day, which it's
[1:08] supposed to overflow from us.
[1:10] Yes.
[1:11] And out from us. But it can only
[1:13] overflow out from us if we have it on
[1:15] the inside of us.
[1:18] And at the same time there can be
[1:20] hindrances. There can be things in our
[1:22] lives that block that. Uh I would say
[1:25] temporarily.
[1:27] You can't if if that life is inside of
[1:29] you, it can't permanently be hindered.
[1:32] But we certainly can make choices and
[1:34] decisions in our own life and we things
[1:36] can come across our path that we refuse
[1:39] to deal with them by the scriptures and
[1:41] those things could then become a a great
[1:43] hindrance not only to ourselves but to
[1:45] others those around us.
[1:47] So fe first Peter 1:13,
[1:52] wherefore g up the loins of your mind,
[1:55] be sober and hope to the end for the
[1:59] grace that is to be brought unto you at
[2:02] the revelation of Jesus Christ.
[2:05] Amen.
[2:06] As obedient children, not fashioning
[2:09] yourselves according to the former lusts
[2:12] in your ignorance.
[2:15] So f that word fashioning
[2:18] your yourselves is the same word from
[2:21] Romans uh 12 verse 2 where it says do
[2:24] not be conformed
[2:26] to this world and brother Bham takes
[2:28] that and says deformed so it's taking
[2:32] it's taking your life one is
[2:34] transforming you into the image of Jesus
[2:37] Christ the other one is deforming you or
[2:40] conforming you to the image of the
[2:44] world,
[2:44] right?
[2:45] Conforming us to the attribute and the
[2:48] nature that the world is, or as Peter
[2:50] puts it, the former lusts that we had
[2:54] that we were following after with our
[2:55] whole heart when we were walking in
[2:58] ignorance.
[2:59] Amen.
[3:00] Verse 15,
[3:02] but as he which hath called you is holy,
[3:04] so be holy in all manner of
[3:08] conversation. The conversation is not
[3:10] just the words that you speak but it's
[3:11] the life that you live the conduct that
[3:14] you have in your own life. Verse 16
[3:17] because it is written be ye holy
[3:21] for I am holy. So this is God's call to
[3:25] us. His desire for us is to be holy.
[3:30] Right? In order to meet him and stand
[3:33] before him the requirement is holiness.
[3:37] And so when we look at that, I was just
[3:40] reading this morning, John Kelvin says,
[3:42] "It's not right that the sanctuary in
[3:45] which God dwells should resemble a
[3:47] filthy stable.
[3:50] It might start out as a filthy stable."
[3:52] That's what the gospel is. Christ comes
[3:54] down to me, the filthy stable, and his
[4:00] work. What does his work result in? is
[4:02] it washes me clean
[4:04] to a place that is fit for him to dwell
[4:07] in for him to be in. And so his call to
[4:11] us is holiness. Now this doesn't this
[4:13] doesn't somehow flip the gospel upside
[4:15] down and the requirement is you have to
[4:18] be holy. No, you don't make yourself
[4:20] holy.
[4:22] He makes us holy. And holy holiness at
[4:25] its very very simplistic level is to be
[4:29] sep set aside or to be different.
[4:34] And so God the root is God is holy.
[4:38] God is holy. What does it mean? God is
[4:39] different. God is separate.
[4:41] Amen.
[4:41] God is not like the rest. He's not like
[4:45] the other gods.
[4:46] Amen.
[4:47] He's not filthy. He's not corrupted.
[4:50] Amen.
[4:50] He's morally perfect.
[4:54] unstained, unspotted. And so he he's
[4:56] saying, "Be holy, for I am holy. We're
[4:59] his people. We come, we're his
[5:01] offspring. We come off of him. He
[5:04] created us and put his own life into the
[5:07] human race for that to be uh multiplied,
[5:10] his his image and likeness to be
[5:12] multiplied." And so, as he is holy,
[5:15] therefore, we have to be we will be an
[5:18] expression of holiness if we're truly
[5:20] his seed. And we're born of the word of
[5:25] God.
[5:27] Verse 17. And if you call on the father
[5:30] who without respect of persons judges
[5:33] according to every man's work, past the
[5:35] time of your sojouring here in fear.
[5:41] Amen. Brother Brandham said that living
[5:45] under the effects of the seventh seal,
[5:48] we should be reverent before God. Amen.
[5:52] That's the That's where that word That's
[5:53] where that word comes from. Fear.
[5:56] We need to pass the time of our
[5:58] sojouring. In other words, we're a
[6:00] stranger
[6:01] in a strange land.
[6:02] Amen.
[6:03] This is this this age, let's put it that
[6:07] way, is not where we belong.
[6:10] This fallen world is not where our
[6:12] citizenship is. Our citizenship is in
[6:15] heaven. And if your citizenship is in
[6:17] heaven, then when you're here sojourning
[6:21] in a strange land, in a strange world,
[6:24] in a strange age, you will do past that
[6:27] time in fear. And again, it's not fear
[6:31] in the sense that you're terrified that
[6:34] something bad is going to happen to you.
[6:37] Although on the other hand is you can
[6:39] understand if you if you don't follow
[6:42] the word of God you can understand that
[6:45] God will measure that back to you.
[6:48] So whatever you whatever you sow that's
[6:52] what you're going to reap.
[6:54] Even even if you do have the Christian
[6:57] life, if you sow to the flesh, if you
[7:01] cater to your flesh, if you're you're
[7:03] you're
[7:05] feeding your flesh by the world's
[7:07] entertainment,
[7:09] by going after things that are not of
[7:12] God, by passing your time, what you're
[7:14] thinking about, you're thinking about
[7:16] ungodly things, lustful things, wicked
[7:19] things. you know, you're you're you're
[7:22] you're in this place where you're not
[7:27] going to find the blessing of God.
[7:30] Doesn't mean you're lost,
[7:32] right?
[7:33] But you can't expect God to bless you
[7:36] when you wa when you're living contrary
[7:38] to his word.
[7:39] Amen.
[7:40] God will always give you the measure
[7:42] that's due you, the measure that is
[7:45] meat. As the Bible said again, if you
[7:49] sow sow to the flesh, you shall of the
[7:52] flesh reap corruption. But if you sow to
[7:54] the spirit, you shall of the spirit reap
[7:56] life everlasting.
[7:57] Amen.
[7:58] And so again, absolutely critical. And I
[8:02] think at at some as we go along, you'll
[8:04] see what I'm talking about a little bit
[8:06] more clearly.
[8:07] The fear of the Lord is the beginning of
[8:10] wisdom. So you want to you want to you
[8:12] want to live a life of wisdom. You can
[8:15] you can never arrive there without first
[8:17] starting with the fear of the Lord
[8:22] first realizing. So what think about
[8:25] that why should we fear the Lord?
[8:27] There's a reason that God tells us to
[8:30] fear him. It's because he does measure
[8:33] according to every to every man
[8:35] according to his works. He does do that.
[8:39] and you say, "Well, I'm a Christian. I'm
[8:41] I'm washed in the blood."
[8:44] Be careful.
[8:46] Be careful about how you speak. Yes,
[8:49] that may be true. But if that whatever
[8:52] you're feeding on is leading you to live
[8:54] a sloppy, ungodly life,
[8:57] there's something wrong at the core.
[8:59] There's something either blocking the
[9:01] life of Christ from going or you don't
[9:02] have it at all.
[9:04] Amen.
[9:04] Or you've never started. It's never been
[9:06] quickened.
[9:07] Amen. And so we can all we can all come
[9:10] to that place. This is there's no one
[9:12] that's immune to that. Preachers,
[9:14] five-fold ministry, deacons,
[9:17] trustees, every believer can be in that
[9:20] position where they are h they've
[9:23] allowed something in their life that
[9:25] they can greatly hinder the work of God
[9:28] in their own life. And God by his grace
[9:30] will allow.
[9:32] It's not his wrath against you. It's his
[9:35] correction of you. And that comes
[9:37] through various different spankings of
[9:40] life.
[9:45] And that's his love. If you and if you
[9:48] can't endure it, it causes you to say,
[9:49] "I don't believe this anyway. God
[9:51] doesn't love me. He doesn't care about
[9:52] me." Then you're bastards and not
[9:54] children.
[9:55] Right?
[9:56] We have to endure the corrections of the
[9:59] Lord.
[10:02] And so pass the time that we have
[10:05] sojourning here in fear because why?
[10:08] Because God is holy. So you should be
[10:11] holy. That's a fearful thing because I
[10:13] maybe maybe um
[10:16] maybe it's different for you but
[10:17] sometimes it's it's easy to forget
[10:22] our own the wickedness of our own
[10:23] hearts.
[10:25] Amen.
[10:25] And we get to this place and we say,
[10:28] "No, I'm washed in the blood. I'm
[10:30] perfect in his sight." That's true. And
[10:32] yet you're still in this flesh and you
[10:34] still have a nature to sin and you can
[10:36] you still can turn aside out of the way.
[10:39] Otherwise, why would the warnings
[10:42] of the Apostle Paul and the Apostle
[10:44] Peter be there?
[10:45] Amen.
[10:46] There's warnings because we can turn
[10:47] aside. We can we can go astray. Now
[10:51] ultimately those who have the Holy
[10:53] Spirit, they're sealed until the day of
[10:54] their redemption
[10:56] regardless of your behavior. But
[10:58] remember also we have to understand that
[11:00] works is faith expressed
[11:03] your the kind of life you live expresses
[11:07] what's on the inside of you.
[11:09] Amen.
[11:13] Second Peter 3:11.
[11:21] Seeing then that all these things shall
[11:24] be dissolved, what manner of persons
[11:27] ought ye to be in all holy conversation
[11:32] and godliness?
[11:35] So that was second Peter 3:11.
[11:38] So Peter is speaking about the day of
[11:40] the Lord and the the dissolution or
[11:46] actually it's a change. It's the
[11:47] loosing,
[11:49] the change of all things, the
[11:50] regeneration of all things, seeing that
[11:52] this earth is going to be burnt with
[11:54] fire.
[11:55] Amen.
[11:56] And it's going to turn into a place
[11:58] where righteousness dwells. Now it's a
[12:00] place where filth dwells, wickedness
[12:02] dwells. It'll turn into a place where
[12:04] righteousness dwells. He said, because
[12:06] of that,
[12:08] what kind of people, what kind of life
[12:10] should we live? What kind of
[12:12] conversation and godliness should we
[12:15] have in our life? It should. In other
[12:17] words, he's using the prophetic word
[12:19] that's promised is you're not going to
[12:21] go to a place where righteousness dwells
[12:23] if you don't first have it in you now.
[12:26] Amen.
[12:27] You can't go to a righteous place unless
[12:29] you're righteous. As brother Bannam
[12:32] says, changing when we die, it doesn't
[12:34] just changes our location.
[12:36] Amen.
[12:37] It doesn't change our nature. So, if our
[12:39] nature is going to be changed, it better
[12:40] be changed now.
[12:43] If our nature is evil and and
[12:45] manifesting wickedness constantly, well,
[12:48] you're going to go where that that
[12:51] belongs.
[12:52] Amen.
[12:56] And so, again, as a critical part and a
[12:59] foundation of living the the life of
[13:02] Christ is holiness, a true revelation of
[13:07] holiness. Actually, you can't even get
[13:09] saved at all unless you understand your
[13:13] need.
[13:14] Amen.
[13:14] And when we talk about holiness, that
[13:17] should immediately cause every true
[13:19] believer to say, "Oh my goodness,
[13:22] Lord, help me. Have mercy upon me."
[13:25] Because you're holy and perfect and
[13:28] without fault. And I
[13:31] if we see ourselves are right, we see
[13:33] how many faults we have and how many
[13:35] mistakes that we make.
[13:36] That's right. Amen.
[13:38] And realize our great need for him. And
[13:40] and that's our foundation of our of the
[13:42] Christian life. You can go further and
[13:44] say, of course, what is the Christian
[13:46] life? And that is the new birth, the
[13:48] Holy Spirit living within us, writing
[13:50] the word in our lives. But
[13:52] to the outward manifestation of that is
[13:55] the fear of the Lord and holiness. And
[13:56] they're they're twins.
[14:00] You can't you can't have the truly have
[14:02] the fear of the Lord unless you
[14:04] understand his holiness and your great
[14:07] need for forgiveness in all of that.
[14:12] Hebrews 12 verse14
[14:21] follow peace with all men and holiness
[14:25] without which no man shall see the Lord.
[14:29] So
[14:32] number one is
[14:35] no no one
[14:37] the Bible says no no no one has seen the
[14:40] Lord but the only begotten no one has
[14:42] seen no no man has seen God right but
[14:45] the only begotten son which is in the
[14:47] bosom of the father he has declared him
[14:50] and in first Timothy it says no man can
[14:54] even can see God he dwells in light
[14:58] that's absolutely absolutely
[14:59] unapproachable.
[15:01] So then there's a number of places that
[15:03] we find that
[15:07] seeing the Lord is the re the reward of
[15:09] the righteous, right?
[15:12] So
[15:14] think about it this way.
[15:17] When
[15:21] when you see the Lord,
[15:24] let's not not just you, not a believer,
[15:27] not just talking about heaven, but when
[15:29] the Lord is manifested,
[15:32] people that aren't following peace and
[15:35] aren't following holiness,
[15:39] what is their response? What is their
[15:41] reaction?
[15:44] They say, "That's not the Lord. that
[15:46] couldn't be the Lord.
[15:49] They reject him. They hate him. They
[15:51] crucify him. That's that's the ultimate
[15:56] uh condemnation of our heart condition
[15:59] from our birth from our natural birth is
[16:02] we don't want to see the Lord. We don't
[16:06] we don't have any love for him. We have
[16:08] something within us that when he comes
[16:11] and manifests himself, we don't like it.
[16:15] You say, "What are you talking about? I
[16:17] loved it. I'm the predestinated seed.
[16:21] I'm ordained to see." Well, you can't
[16:23] circumvent Romans 3.
[16:25] Amen.
[16:26] It It's not you seeking after God. It's
[16:29] not you wanting God. It's not you
[16:31] desiring God. It's God seeking you. It's
[16:34] God desiring you. It's God coming for
[16:37] you. You never would have responded
[16:38] unless he first opens your heart.
[16:41] Amen. Lydia only responded to the
[16:43] message that Paul was preaching because
[16:45] the Lord opened her heart.
[16:49] And who are the ones that believe? The
[16:50] book of Acts tells us as many as were
[16:52] ordained to eternal life believed.
[16:56] And the statement of Jesus as we as I
[16:59] preached last week
[17:02] in in John 6, no man can come to me
[17:05] unless the father draws him first.
[17:08] And so man in his own carnal nature
[17:11] hates God and doesn't want to see him.
[17:12] So a prere prerequisite for seeing God
[17:17] is holiness. Now we're in trouble.
[17:20] Again, this is what the gospel is for.
[17:22] That's why he comes to us. He gives us a
[17:24] new heart. He changes us. He gives us a
[17:26] new nature. Right? And so those who
[17:31] don't have holiness in their life, they
[17:34] certainly would not be pleased to see
[17:37] the Lord.
[17:38] They wouldn't enjoy being in heaven.
[17:42] They wouldn't they wouldn't like it. It
[17:44] would be displeasing to their nature
[17:46] because it goes completely goes against
[17:48] them because it is a place of purity and
[17:51] holiness.
[17:53] Amen.
[17:56] And so we can't with unless we're
[17:58] following peace, unless we're following
[18:00] holiness, we will never see the Lord.
[18:02] Again, this is one of those verses where
[18:04] you go, "Hey, are we saved by our
[18:05] works?" No. Again, looking at what's
[18:09] manifested on the outside,
[18:12] the outside. This is the outward
[18:14] manifestation of an inward work. If an
[18:17] inward work is there, you'll follow
[18:19] peace and holiness.
[18:20] You're not going to be a brawler.
[18:22] There's not going to be a fight wherever
[18:23] you go.
[18:26] Right?
[18:29] The the the inward peace will produce an
[18:32] outward peace and that outward peace is
[18:34] not only with yourself but it's with
[18:37] others
[18:40] and it'll be manifested outwardly in
[18:42] that you are different from other
[18:44] people.
[18:46] You are a stranger and a pilgrim. You're
[18:48] not the same.
[18:51] and verse 15,
[18:54] looking diligently lest any man fail of
[18:57] the grace of God, lest any root of
[19:00] bitterness springing up trouble you and
[19:03] thereby many be defiled.
[19:07] Once again, I think in I believe it's in
[19:10] chapter 10 and here again in chapter 12,
[19:15] Paul is showing that within the outward
[19:19] people of God, there are different kinds
[19:22] of believers.
[19:23] Amen.
[19:24] Paul is emphasizing two. Brother
[19:25] Brandham shows us that there's actually
[19:27] three. The believer, the makebeliever,
[19:29] and the unbeliever. Paul Paul is looking
[19:31] here and he's seeing there's there's
[19:33] people that produce the right fruit
[19:37] and there's p people that produce the
[19:39] fruit of weeds and thorns and briars
[19:42] right who's he says their end is to be
[19:44] burned but amongst the people of God or
[19:48] the the the Jesus calls it the kingdom
[19:50] of heaven the kingdom of heaven is like
[19:52] when a ser went forth to sew and now you
[19:54] suddenly see there's right in the
[19:56] kingdom of heaven there's children of
[19:58] the devil and children of the son of
[20:00] man.
[20:00] Amen.
[20:02] Right in the midst of it. And so here as
[20:04] we're looking at this, I'll never be
[20:06] able to get through this. I just have a
[20:07] couple minutes, but just laying the
[20:10] foundation for the future times is that
[20:14] there can be a root of bitterness
[20:18] that can spring up and trouble not only
[20:22] yourself but defile people around you.
[20:26] Amen. And so there's there's a place
[20:29] where that you know this that others are
[20:33] defiled when the fruit grows, right? So
[20:36] once the fruit grows from that seed
[20:39] that's been planted. So first anytime
[20:41] there's a root, we know that there had
[20:43] to have been in seed form first. So, the
[20:47] root of bitterness, and we're not going
[20:49] to be able to get to it this time, but
[20:50] in Deuteronomy
[20:52] um chapter 29, it speaks about the fruit
[20:55] is what actually ends up defiling the
[20:59] fruit uh uh defiling others around you.
[21:03] And this bitterness that can be planted
[21:07] within your soul
[21:09] uh is something that is what hinders or
[21:12] causes the grace of God to fail in your
[21:15] life. Now again this requires a whole
[21:19] explanation but the grace of God can
[21:22] never fail
[21:24] but we can fail the grace of God that's
[21:27] presented to us. Now once you receive
[21:30] the grace of God you can make mistakes.
[21:33] You can you can fall away but you'll
[21:36] come back. You can go up and down. So
[21:38] looking at the outward manifestation of
[21:42] God's grace in the kingdom of heaven
[21:44] versus the person himself that's
[21:48] predestinated unto eternal life. There
[21:51] is a there is a great danger in
[21:53] misunderstanding
[21:54] eternal security and the sovereignty of
[21:56] God. And we understand that our lives
[21:59] are the outworking of the mind of God.
[22:01] And so if our lives fail to put forth
[22:04] the fruit of eternal life, it shows that
[22:07] there's a problem. Again,
[22:09] it can either be a problem in the grace
[22:11] of God being hindered by how you've
[22:14] chosen to live or it can be the fact
[22:16] that you actually are not a recipient of
[22:18] the grace of God.
[22:20] Amen.
[22:20] Right? And so how how critical it is
[22:23] then to understand and realize that
[22:27] we can't let a seed
[22:30] of a bitter fruit be planted in our
[22:33] heart.
[22:34] Amen.
[22:34] And when we allow that to be planted
[22:37] without dealing with it, what ends up
[22:39] happening is
[22:41] you are ruined.
[22:44] You are hindered. And those around you
[22:47] are also hindered. I'm going to have to
[22:49] just stop,
[22:52] take the parachute, and jump out. Let's
[22:54] pray. Heavenly Father, we thank you so
[22:56] much for your word. We pray, Lord, that
[22:58] you would
[22:59] reveal it more and more to our hearts,
[23:00] Lord, and that you'd draw us closer to
[23:02] Christ, that our lives would be an
[23:03] expression of him. We commit ourselves
[23:05] to you. We commit the service and the
[23:07] worship and the preaching of the word to
[23:08] you. May you be glorified in our midst.
[23:10] We ask in Jesus name. Amen.
