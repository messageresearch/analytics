[0:40] able to tie these two things together
[0:42] this
[0:43] morning Genesis 13 we're just going to
[0:45] catch one
[0:50] verse and it
[0:52] says and lot lifted up his eyes and
[0:56] beheld all the plain of Jordan but it
[0:58] was welled Ed everywhere before the Lord
[1:01] destroyed Sodom and gomorra even as the
[1:03] garden of the Lord like the land of
[1:05] Egypt as thou comest unto zor and then
[1:08] let's turn into the Book of Judges
[1:12] Judges chapter
[1:14] 17 this is a little bit of I've never
[1:18] done any study
[1:19] on Judges chapter 17 so this is this is
[1:24] fun for me uh Judges chapter 17 and it
[1:26] says we're going to read the first uh
[1:28] six verses it says Thou shalt
[1:30] not sacrifice unto the
[1:35] Lord that sorry I'm in the wrong book
[1:38] that would help judges 17 chap chapter
[1:41] 17 verse1 and there was a man of Mount
[1:44] Ephraim whose name was Micah and he said
[1:47] unto his mother the 1100 shekels of
[1:49] silver that were taken from thee about
[1:52] which thou curses and spakest of also in
[1:54] mine ears behold the silver is with me I
[1:58] took it and his mother said blessed be
[2:01] thou of the Lord my son and when he had
[2:04] restored the 1100 shekels of silver to
[2:06] his mother his mother said I had wholly
[2:08] dedicated the silver unto the Lord from
[2:11] my hand for my son to make a Graven
[2:14] image and a molten image now therefore I
[2:16] will restore it unto thee yet He
[2:19] restored the money unto his mother and
[2:20] his mother took 200 shekels of silver
[2:23] and gave them to the founder who made
[2:25] thereof a Graven image and a molten
[2:27] image and they were in the house of
[2:29] Micah and the man Micah had a house of
[2:31] gods and made an ephod and a teraphim
[2:33] and consecrated one of his sons who
[2:36] became his priest and catch this verse
[2:38] in those days there was no king in
[2:40] Israel but every man did that which was
[2:43] right in his own eyes God bless you as
[2:45] you take your seats this morning we're
[2:48] going to go through a little bit of this
[2:49] story here in the Book of Judges um just
[2:52] want to show you the the significance of
[2:56] idol worship here and how significant
[2:59] this particular Idol worshipper really
[3:01] was and how he actually became one of
[3:03] the the main causes that idol worship
[3:06] became so prevalent in Israel during
[3:08] this time and I'm going to go through
[3:10] some quotes here as well that of that
[3:12] the prophet made that really struck me I
[3:14] was listening to last night Lord really
[3:16] inspired my heart uh heavily on this on
[3:18] this topic for this morning I'm going to
[3:20] call this lesson this morning
[3:23] Everlasting consequences Everlasting
[3:26] consequences so during this specific
[3:28] time in Israel's history the Bible said
[3:30] that there was neither there was there
[3:32] was no King and at this specific time
[3:34] there was no judge either it was right
[3:36] after the Samson had judged and uh you
[3:39] know from our opening text we read how
[3:41] there was a man by the name of Micah of
[3:43] Mount Ephraim and Micah had committed
[3:45] this act of of thievery with his mother
[3:47] he had stolen some of her M money so he
[3:50] confessed what he had done to her and
[3:52] then in their reconciliation she
[3:54] actually blessed Micah and took some of
[3:57] the money that he had stolen from her
[3:59] and then commed it to the Lord but in so
[4:01] doing that she wanted him to make an
[4:04] idol of the silver so that they could
[4:06] Worship the Lord through that Idol so
[4:09] Micah took that money that was
[4:11] originally stolen and they made that
[4:12] Idol and the Bible says that the idol
[4:15] stayed in the house of Micah verse five
[4:18] where we read says that Micah had a
[4:19] house of gods and then what happens is
[4:22] that he actually consecrated one of his
[4:24] sons to be a priest in the house and
[4:27] verse six there where I said to take
[4:28] notice you you know there was no judge
[4:30] on the scene there was no King and then
[4:32] in this verse
[4:34] explicitly that every man did right in
[4:37] his own eyes and that's really one of
[4:39] the it's it's a really a sad verse
[4:41] because we know what proverb says that
[4:43] there is a way that seeth right unto a
[4:45] man but the end thereof are the ways of
[4:48] death Proverbs 14:12 and you know if you
[4:50] if you think about this Micah didn't
[4:52] build this altar to serve some foreign
[4:55] God Micah and his mother's intentions
[4:57] were to build this altar to serve the
[5:00] Lord God and what what it was it
[5:03] actually got dedicated to the Lord and
[5:05] then it was used as an image to Worship
[5:07] the Lord it was it was a religious act I
[5:09] read this commentary on it and it says
[5:11] that he obviously Micah obviously wanted
[5:13] to maintain a religious influence in his
[5:16] home but he went about it the wrong way
[5:19] he his apparently good intentions were
[5:21] not enough he needed to follow God's
[5:24] laws and not his own idea of what was
[5:28] right if Micah truly loved God he would
[5:30] have desired to know what God had
[5:32] communicated to his people and what he
[5:34] should do about it instead Micah set up
[5:37] his own religious system for his own
[5:39] benefit and then he says don't think
[5:41] that sincerity and good intentions are
[5:43] good enough you may be in danger of
[5:46] thinking that you need no instructions
[5:48] from God's word or anything else and I
[5:51] want you to think about that this
[5:52] morning sincerity and good intentions
[5:54] are are Never Enough when it comes to
[5:56] worshiping God I read this this
[5:58] statement you know and and and and it
[6:00] struck me it says when a man follows his
[6:02] own instincts it leads to ruin and
[6:05] that's the truth because we're we're
[6:07] born in sin and we're shaped in iniquity
[6:08] amen and verse seven if you go read
[6:11] verse seven of this chapter in judges 17
[6:14] just to kind of break down some of this
[6:15] story it begins to describe how there
[6:17] was a priest who was sojourning in the
[6:20] land so he was traveling through the
[6:21] land and this young man we come to later
[6:25] realize that his name was Jonathan and
[6:27] if you go if we go and study The Book of
[6:30] Numbers you realize that the tribe of
[6:32] Levi was supposed to be set apart by God
[6:36] as priests under the tribe of Israel in
[6:39] fact when God was giving out their the
[6:41] land for for the for their inheritance
[6:44] the Levites were actually not given a
[6:46] land because they were supposed to be
[6:48] set apart to serve God and the nation of
[6:51] Israel the Bible says that the Lord was
[6:53] their inheritance God himself was their
[6:56] portion so if you read this story and
[6:57] you realize that this Levi that comes
[7:00] into the house of Micah he was actually
[7:03] in a backsliding condition and Micah
[7:05] somehow thought it was providential that
[7:07] a priest just passed along his way and
[7:10] he makes the priest an offer in verse 10
[7:12] he says it say he says dwell with me and
[7:15] be a father and a priest and I will give
[7:17] thee 10 shekels of silver by the year
[7:20] and a suit of apparel and thy victuals
[7:22] and he went in that levite was
[7:24] backsliding because if you go read in in
[7:26] numbers priests and their assistants
[7:28] they were all members of the tribe of
[7:30] Levi they were to serve the people and
[7:32] to teach them how to worship God and
[7:34] they were to do that in the temple they
[7:35] were to not do it in homes they were
[7:37] explicitly told not to do that not to
[7:39] perform victuals and and rituals in in
[7:42] people's homes nothing in the law gave
[7:45] the priest access to perform Priestly
[7:47] duties in the individual's home then if
[7:49] you go read verse 13 then said Micah and
[7:52] now watch this then said Micah now that
[7:54] I know the Lord will do me good seeing
[7:56] that I have a levite to be my priest and
[7:59] thought this was amazing Matthew Henry
[8:00] says Micah thought it was a sign of
[8:03] God's favor to him and his images that a
[8:05] levite should come to his door thus
[8:08] those who please themselves with their
[8:10] own delusions if Providence unexpectedly
[8:13] brings anything to their hands that
[8:16] further them in their evil way they're
[8:19] apt from then to think that God is
[8:21] pleased with them think about that for a
[8:23] moment just because you're doing
[8:25] something and providentially something
[8:26] comes along your way that you think is
[8:28] confirming it you need to match it up
[8:30] with the word because he didn't match it
[8:31] up with the word and he thought he was
[8:33] living in the right place but that
[8:35] levite was backslid they were serving
[8:37] idols and they were living in the wrong
[8:38] kind of place and nothing about this
[8:41] entire situation was according to the
[8:42] word and Micah was under some kind of a
[8:45] delusion because some apparent sign of
[8:47] this blessing came through the house
[8:49] that was completely out of the will of
[8:51] God now if you move into chapter 18 the
[8:55] tribe of Dan sought for themselves an
[8:58] inheritance so the Bible says say just
[8:59] kind of reading through the story so the
[9:00] Bible says that they came to the Mount
[9:02] of Ephraim and then they came into the
[9:04] house of Micah and lodged there and they
[9:07] heard the voice of the priest and they
[9:08] recognized it so what did they do so
[9:10] they sought counsel of God through this
[9:13] backslidden priest now this was a time
[9:15] that there was really there was no
[9:17] Direction so they were they were looking
[9:19] for direction and so they had saw the
[9:22] images that were laid in Micah's house
[9:24] and they saw that there was this levite
[9:25] so then they they they they went to this
[9:28] levite and asked a counsel from the Lord
[9:31] and the counsel that they received was
[9:33] that they would be blessed and so they
[9:35] they went on their way and they departed
[9:36] but then if you skip down in into later
[9:39] verses in chapter 18 in their journeying
[9:41] through the country then they came again
[9:45] to uh through the country and they came
[9:47] again to the house of Micah this time
[9:50] they had over 600 men with them and the
[9:53] men that had previously gone to the
[9:55] house of Micah so there was there was
[9:57] just a small group of men from that
[9:58] tribe who had gone to the house of Micah
[10:01] and then they went on their way cuz they
[10:02] thought they were blessed of God and
[10:03] then later on they came journeying
[10:05] through that land and they realized that
[10:07] this was the same place that they were
[10:08] they had much more men so then those men
[10:11] told the entire tribe we need to go down
[10:13] to this house because there's a Levi and
[10:15] there's graven images and we need to
[10:17] take what they have so they went into
[10:19] Micah's house and they took the images
[10:21] and the idols they even took the priest
[10:24] if you read judges 1818 we can pull it
[10:26] up and those they went into Micah's
[10:28] house and they fed fetch the carved
[10:30] images and the ephod and the terapin and
[10:32] the molten images then said the priest
[10:34] unto them what do ye and they said unto
[10:36] him hold thy peace lay thine hand upon
[10:39] thy mouth and go with us and be to us a
[10:42] father and a priest it is better for
[10:44] thee to be a priest under the house of
[10:46] one man or that thou be a priest unto a
[10:48] tribe and family in Israel and so the
[10:50] priest's heart was glad and he took the
[10:52] ephod and he took the teraphim and he
[10:55] took the graven images and went into the
[10:57] midst of the people so they turned and
[10:59] they departed and put the little ones
[11:00] and the cattle and the carriage before
[11:02] them and from this series of events
[11:04] Micah got so upset that he pursued the
[11:08] men and he started lamenting to them and
[11:11] he said you've taken away my gods which
[11:13] I worshiped and and the priest that I've
[11:15] served what am I going to do he had
[11:17] gotten so attached to the to the images
[11:20] that he was serving he was no longer
[11:22] serving God he was serving those images
[11:24] and he had made this priest and saints
[11:28] of God I never want to be like my where
[11:29] I get so attached to Idols in my life
[11:32] that I can't get past those things we
[11:34] are to take the spiritual context out of
[11:36] these things you have Idols we have
[11:38] there's Idols that that are anything
[11:40] that takes your time away from God is an
[11:42] idol amen and so if you're serving that
[11:45] thing and God comes in your life to try
[11:47] to strip that thing out of your life you
[11:49] don't need to lament after that Idol you
[11:51] need to say that's what God wants in my
[11:53] life even if it's a little hard even if
[11:55] it's a little difficult even if it's
[11:56] been in your home for a long time you
[11:58] need to realize that God is trying to do
[12:00] something in your life amen and he said
[12:02] I'm so stricken because I'm so bonded to
[12:05] those Idols in my life that I can't let
[12:07] them go and you
[12:10] know just just some simple Concepts this
[12:13] morning entertainment can be an idol
[12:17] amen Recreation can be an idol amen a
[12:21] certain friendship can be an idol a
[12:23] relationship can be an idol if somehow
[12:27] whatever situation you're in you you you
[12:29] put it there you put the dot dot dot
[12:30] there if it's taking your your time away
[12:34] from God or if it's drawing you from a
[12:36] relationship with God then it is an idol
[12:39] and you need to recognize that that is
[12:41] an idol in your life amen the tribe of
[12:44] Dan saw the lamenting of Micah but they
[12:47] convinced him that that he needed to
[12:49] turn back and go back home otherwise
[12:51] they were going to destroy him and take
[12:53] his life because the tribe of Dan had a
[12:55] had a great number of men and Micah only
[12:57] had a few men and so
[12:59] and I thought these last few verses were
[13:01] so powerful to me judges 18 and chapter
[13:04] uh chapter 18: 28-31 and there was no
[13:06] deliverer because it was far from zidon
[13:10] because and they had no business with
[13:12] any man and it was in the valley that
[13:13] lith by Beth Rob and they built a city
[13:16] and dwelt therein and they called the
[13:18] name of that City Dan after n the after
[13:22] the name of Dan their father who was
[13:23] born in Israel how be it the name of the
[13:25] city was Lees at the first and the
[13:28] children now catch the this this morning
[13:29] if you're paying attention and the
[13:31] children of Dan set up a Graven image
[13:33] and Jonathan the son of gersam the son
[13:35] of Manasseh he and his sons were priests
[13:38] to the tribe of Dan until the day of
[13:42] captivity of the land and they set them
[13:44] up Micah's graven images which he made
[13:47] all the time that the house of God was
[13:50] in Shiloh I want you to notice this this
[13:51] morning the decisions that you make have
[13:54] a lasting effect on more than just your
[13:57] life I want you to catch that this
[13:59] morning the decisions you make have a
[14:01] lasting impact on more than just your
[14:03] life Micah's decision to create an idol
[14:05] in his house led to an entire tribe that
[14:08] served an idol until they were led into
[14:11] captivity saints of God there's an idol
[14:14] that if there's something that's taking
[14:15] your time away from God realize that
[14:17] it's affecting more than just you it's
[14:19] affecting your family it's affecting
[14:20] your fathers your mothers your children
[14:23] and you need to realize that there's
[14:24] something that's that's grabbing your
[14:26] attention amen amen I taught this in in
[14:29] the study last night you know the the
[14:31] priest that was a levite his son his
[14:33] name was Jonathan the son of gersham who
[14:35] was gersam gersham was the son of Moses
[14:38] the grandson of Moses had gotten into
[14:41] such a backsliding condition in his life
[14:43] it doesn't matter who you are and what
[14:45] family you come from and what lineage
[14:47] you are he had gotten so backslid that
[14:50] he took the images that that that this
[14:52] King had set up or this man had set up
[14:54] in his home and he caused an entire
[14:56] tribe to worship those images he took
[14:58] their worship from a true God from our
[15:01] God those Idols that you worship they
[15:03] take your time from God God's wanting to
[15:06] have a relationship with you he wants to
[15:08] have a a bond with you but you're
[15:10] worshiping an idol in your life he was
[15:13] backslid Hallelujah God God requires
[15:17] obedience to his word amen the city of
[15:19] Dan and they called the name of that
[15:21] City Dan the city of Dan will become the
[15:24] most and listen to this I caught this
[15:26] the city of Dan will become the most
[15:28] prominent Northern City in Israel the
[15:30] phrase they came up with a phrase and it
[15:32] was from Dan to beeba and it became an
[15:36] an expression from the north to the
[15:38] south of Israel indicating all of Israel
[15:40] and I want you to catch this last verse
[15:42] a note on this last verse the children
[15:43] of Dan set up for themselves the carved
[15:46] images this was the beginning listen to
[15:48] this this was the beginning of
[15:50] established idolatry in Israel in the
[15:53] promised land there was always
[15:55] individual idolatry but now had come a
[15:58] time where it wasn't individualized
[16:00] anymore it had caused an entire tribe to
[16:02] worship those images because they were
[16:04] looking for something and they found it
[16:06] in the wrong place and instead of
[16:08] checking themselves with God and with
[16:10] the word and with the laws that he had
[16:12] associated with them they they found
[16:15] this Idol and they worshiped this Idol
[16:17] and think about the chain of events that
[16:18] happen in this chapter a man made a
[16:20] decision to serve an idol in place of
[16:22] God and it ended with an entire tribe of
[16:26] Israel led into established idolatry how
[16:29] sad of a point that is this morning his
[16:31] personal idolatry became the idolatry of
[16:34] an entire tribe think of it think of
[16:37] that this morning I want to take a turn
[16:38] here this morning I know I'm kind of
[16:39] preaching but the Lord's just inspired
[16:41] my heart we're talking about choices
[16:43] this morning choices that affect you
[16:45] choices that affect your family choices
[16:47] that fathers choices that affect your
[16:50] children husbands choices that affect
[16:52] your wives choices that can have
[16:54] everlasting consequences brother Brandon
[16:57] makes this statement and he's talking
[16:59] about lot with that scripture we read he
[17:00] says you see when Abraham was sitting
[17:02] under his tent because he had made a
[17:04] choice and that choice is brought before
[17:07] every person that's born in this world
[17:09] the tree of Good and Evil is set before
[17:11] every person listen to that this morning
[17:13] the tree of Good and Evil is set before
[17:15] every person and when lot his nephew and
[17:18] their herdsmen began to argue about the
[17:21] grounds Abraham being a just man said to
[17:24] them just let there be no arguments
[17:25] among Among Us you choose your going
[17:27] away and that Place comes into every
[17:29] believer's life and it's before you this
[17:31] morning and it's before me and I want
[17:33] you to catch what he says this morning
[17:35] he says lot didn't think that he was
[17:38] going to backslide but what did he do he
[17:40] went looking towards Sodom Sodom where
[17:43] things were easy and there's so many
[17:45] times that we look towards the easy way
[17:47] I'll join this church and you see nobody
[17:50] will say anything against it because
[17:51] it's the biggest church in the city many
[17:53] times we do that when we're wrong he
[17:56] didn't know he was going to backslide
[17:58] but you saw the backslid and condition
[18:00] in in in his expression when he looked
[18:02] towards the city remember he says
[18:05] remember if you follow Christ you'll be
[18:08] hated by people for all that live Godly
[18:11] in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution
[18:13] and if you come to Christ you'll not
[18:15] come by any church or any denomination
[18:17] or any Creed you'll come by the blood
[18:19] that's the only Avenue and you cannot
[18:21] bring no one with you you'll come alone
[18:23] and stand on your own confession and

[18:33] choices many times we make those foolish
[18:36] choices what if lot when he seen

[18:42] much money and much popularity because
[18:44] he'd be a stranger and a smart man and
[18:46] educated and a lot of psychology and he
[18:48] could do certain things and yet maintain
[18:51] his religion he thought I've got faith
[18:53] in God I'll just go down into Sodom and

[20:55] the fire burning up in that City but he
[20:58] made a choice and he stayed in that City
[21:01] knowing it was full of sin how many
[21:03] opportunities Came Upon lot to leave
[21:06] that City when it when the sin just
[21:08] started compounding how many
[21:10] opportunities did he have to to stop to
[21:13] to take his family to to rid that home
[21:16] of that impurity to rid his home of the
[21:19] idols that they were having how many
[21:21] opportunities did he have think of the
[21:25] consequences of that decision every time
[21:27] he made that decision and I know for the
[21:29] rest of Lot's mortal life he thought
[21:32] about those choices that he made and I
[21:34] know he had so many regrets oh if I
[21:36] could just go back and leave the city
[21:38] when I know my wife's heart wasn't
[21:40] turned oh if I could just go back don't
[21:43] be like that don't be like Micah it will
[21:46] have lasting effects Micah's idolatry
[21:49] had lasting effects on the tribe of Dan
[21:51] and on the entire Kingdom of Israel lot
[21:55] didn't know that his choice was going to
[21:57] cause his wife to lose her life
[21:59] and cause his daughters to turn to
[22:00] fornication and cause you know the
[22:03] amalekites came out of that decision and
[22:06] you know how the rest of that turns out
[22:07] because he lifted up his eyes towards
[22:09] the easy
[22:11] way and today saints of God you know it
[22:13] may not always be easy it may not always
[22:16] be an easy choice to rid your life of
[22:18] the idols you've been serving in
[22:20] entertainment or the idols of
[22:22] materialism we've talked about that or
[22:24] to consecrate your home and to St and to
[22:26] take a stand on holiness and on
[22:29] righteousness but if you don't take a
[22:30] stand and if you don't choose the
[22:33] effects of your decision will long
[22:35] Outlast your life the choices you make
[22:39] can have everlasting consequences your
[22:42] wife your husband your children they
[22:44] will be influenced by the choices that
[22:46] you make and it would cause their life
[22:49] to end up like lot's life somehow by the
[22:52] grace of God he managed to get out of
[22:54] that City but his daughters and his wife
[22:56] and his son-in-laws
