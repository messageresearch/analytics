[0:00] gracious father we just come before you
[0:02] Lord and we ask that your presence would
[0:04] be with us today father prepare our
[0:06] hearts for the worship and for the word
[0:08] Lord I pray you bless the Sunday School
[0:10] father and may it may it uh build and
[0:13] increase our faith we ask in Jesus name
[0:15] amen all
[0:17] right seventh and final
[0:21] installment of the truth about our
[0:25] future home and so if you want to go
[0:27] ahead and bring up that PowerPoint
[0:31] we're going to get right into a quote
[0:34] from brother
[0:36] brandham and I believe this is from his
[0:40] life
[0:41] story spoken in
[0:45] 1959 and I turned and looked and there
[0:48] was great big palaces and the glory of
[0:50] God coming up around them and I heard an
[0:53] Angelic choir singing my home sweet home
[0:56] I started up along long steps running
[0:58] just as hard as I could
[1:00] and when I got to the door there she
[1:02] stood a white garment on that black hair
[1:04] long holding down her back she raised
[1:07] out her arms as she always did when I
[1:09] come home tired from work or something I
[1:11] caught her by the hands and I said honey
[1:13] I seen Sharon down there I said she made
[1:15] a pretty girl didn't
[1:17] she she said yes Bill she said Bill put
[1:20] her arms around me she said just around
[1:23] my shoulder she started pading me she
[1:25] said stop worrying about me and
[1:28] Sharon I said honey I can't help it she
[1:31] said now Sharon and I are better off
[1:33] than you are and said' don't worry about
[1:34] us no more will you promise me amen I
[1:38] think I think about that and it amazes
[1:42] me
[1:43] because the loss and the pain that
[1:46] brother brandham had in that in that
[1:50] time that he
[1:52] felt and as much as God dealt with him
[1:56] the Visions he had how the Lord dealt
[1:59] with him it was such a struggle to the
[2:01] point where he tried to end his own life
[2:03] and it if it wasn't for the grace of God
[2:05] he wouldn't have he he wouldn't have
[2:07] continued his life and uh here now his
[2:12] wife is in a different place with a
[2:14] different perspective with an
[2:15] understanding I know you're in pain I
[2:17] know this is hard I know this it feels
[2:20] impossible but stop worrying amen and I
[2:23] think what a revelation that is for us
[2:25] for our loved ones that have gone on is
[2:27] don't worry about them if we have if we
[2:30] really have the right perspective don't
[2:31] worry about them they're they're well
[2:34] taken care of they're they're they're
[2:36] happier than they've ever been they're
[2:38] in
[2:44] a we just have to worry about making
[2:47] sure we make we make it
[2:49] there to be with
[2:51] them and I said hope I said I've been so
[2:54] lonesome for you and for Sharon and
[2:55] Billy cries all the time for you I said
[2:57] I don't know what to do with him and she
[2:59] said it'll be all right Bill she said
[3:02] just promise me you won't worry no more
[3:05] and she said won't you sit down and I
[3:08] looked around and there was a great big
[3:09] chair so perspective you know you we're
[3:12] so limited by time we're so limited by
[3:15] our perspective of life and here she is
[3:19] she can say this isn't just empty words
[3:22] well it's just uh nice little vision
[3:24] it's it's really it should hit home for
[3:27] us don't it'll be all right
[3:31] God's God has everything under his
[3:33] control we don't have to worry about it
[3:36] we we whether we've lost a loved one
[3:38] someone has gone on we didn't lose them
[3:42] we know right where they are and so here
[3:45] she's going to give him some even better
[3:48] perspective says and I looked around and
[3:50] there was a great big chair and I
[3:52] remember I tried to buy a chair now in
[3:54] closing I tried to buy a chair one time
[3:56] we just had them old common wooden
[3:58] bottom chairs for that breakfast set we
[4:01] had to had to use them the only chairs
[4:03] we had and we could buy one of the
[4:04] chairs that would let back in the back
[4:07] like I forget what kind of easy chair
[4:08] rest chair and it cost $17 and you could
[4:12] pay $3 down in a dollar a week and we
[4:14] got one and know when I'd come I'd work
[4:16] all day and preach till midnight around
[4:17] the streets and wherever I could preach
[4:20] and now one day I got behind on my
[4:22] payments I couldn't make it and it got
[4:24] day after day and finally one day they
[4:26] come by and got my chair and took it
[4:29] that night I never we'll forget she had
[4:30] a cherry pie baked poor little old thing
[4:32] she know I was going to be disappointed
[4:34] after supper I said what's you so good
[4:37] about tonight honey she said say I I had
[4:40] the boys over in the neighborhood to dig
[4:42] some fishing worms don't you think we
[4:44] had to go down to the river and fish a
[4:46] little while I said yes but and she
[4:48] started crying I know there was
[4:50] something wrong I had an idea cuz they'd
[4:52] already sent me a notice they was coming
[4:53] to get it and we couldn't make that
[4:55] dollar payment a week we couldn't
[4:58] couldn't afford it she put her her arms
[5:00] around me and I went to the door and my
[5:01] chair was gone she told me up there she
[5:04] said you remember that CH chair Bill I
[5:07] said yes honey I remember I said that's
[5:09] what you was thinking about wasn't it
[5:11] yeah she said well they won't take this
[5:15] one this one's paid for amen she said
[5:18] sit down just a minute I want to talk to
[5:20] you and I said honey I don't understand
[5:21] this she said promise me Billy promise
[5:24] me that you won't worry anymore you're
[5:27] going back now and he said promise me
[5:29] you won't worry and I said I I can't do
[5:30] that
[5:32] hope and just then I come to it was in
[5:35] the dark room I looked around and I felt
[5:36] her arm around me I said hope are you
[5:38] here in the room she started patting me
[5:40] she said you you going to make me that
[5:42] promise Bill promise me you won't worry
[5:44] no more I said I promise you
[5:48] amen worry and fear is perspective
[5:53] based under our limitations true Faith
[5:56] makes that connection with God and says
[5:59] the there's nothing to worry and there's
[6:00] nothing to fear we're not promised an
[6:03] easy life a Carefree pain-free life we
[6:06] are actually told we will have troubles
[6:08] why because we're fighting on God's side
[6:11] there's an enemy against us trying to
[6:13] rule this world and we're the only thing
[6:15] holding him back from taking complete
[6:18] control over everything so of course
[6:20] we're going to have troubles and trials
[6:22] but we have a promise that we have a
[6:25] home we have a rest our citizenship
[6:27] isn't in America or Canada or Mexico
[6:32] it's in heaven that's where we
[6:35] belong hope where went to where she
[6:38] belonged that's where she was from our
[6:41] perspective is we lost them and they
[6:43] belong here and we could have had a full
[6:45] life and we missed out on this and we
[6:47] missed out on
[6:49] that and there's an aspect humanly
[6:52] speaking that that is true but not in
[6:55] God's economy not in God's Vision not in
[6:58] God's plan God knew what he had to do to
[7:01] make brother brandham the brother
[7:03] brandham that he needed to be amen for
[7:05] the purpose that God had
[7:28] for
[7:39] as Paul said if if we have a hope only
[7:42] in this life we're above all men most
[7:46] miserable so our hope isn't just in this
[7:48] life our hope is in heaven brother
[7:51] brandom's hope was in heaven here
[7:54] twofold his hope and his hope and so
[7:57] that he he he could realize he was told
[8:00] don't worry Don't
[8:02] Fear now let's look further people say
[8:06] are there animals in heaven we went
[8:07] through the scriptures on this but I
[8:08] want to read to you what brother
[8:09] brandham said and I looked coming down
[8:12] across the hill and here come old Fritz
[8:14] he looked at me come up and lick me on
[8:16] the hand I patted him just then old
[8:17] Prince my horse come put his neck around
[8:20] my shoulder and begin to nicker I said
[8:21] oh God I looked up and he said all the
[8:23] ever loved and all that ever loved you
[8:26] is gathered here amen
[8:30] hallelujah amen now again I I don't want
[8:34] to I I made this point many times ago
[8:37] but I'm going to bring it up again this
[8:39] doesn't bypass the new birth repentance
[8:42] being filled with the Holy Ghost um God
[8:45] dealing with people's lives it doesn't
[8:46] bypass the word but what what is being
[8:49] it's not saying every single thing that
[8:51] you ever love is going to be there what
[8:54] what is it those things that God has
[8:56] redeemed from your life are going to be
[8:58] there see you know we we we have to take
[9:02] the promise and base it on God's word
[9:05] strictly not our own thinking about it
[9:08] but with that said Fritz is there Prince
[9:11] is there his his favorite animals are
[9:15] there as a promise for him his chair is
[9:19] there how far do we go when we look at
[9:23] what God redeems for us and and
[9:25] preserves for us as we talked before
[9:28] there's a bank account
[9:30] that we have in heaven and we can make
[9:32] deposits in it right and
[9:34] so the rewards that God gives to US
[9:39] based
[9:40] on we don't even deserve it right we're
[9:43] not earning that it's all by grace and
[9:47] yet every sacrifice that we make every
[9:50] gift that we give you know with a true
[9:52] heart God says you're going to get it
[9:55] back a h
[9:57] hundredfold right remember what we
[10:00] talked about before what percentage is
[10:02] hundredfold it's actually
[10:05] 10,000% so the things that we've lost
[10:08] look at this brother brandom got his
[10:10] horse back got his dog back those things
[10:13] that were special I believe that he'll
[10:15] do the same thing for you and it it
[10:16] isn't just limited to animals it can be
[10:20] everything you say could it what what
[10:22] could it be what what is the limit I
[10:24] don't I don't know amen I don't know
[10:28] maybe God will give you back when one of
[10:29] your old cars brother Mark I don't know
[10:32] say it's not possible because it'll
[10:35] be I wouldn't think it's possible to get
[10:38] your horse
[10:39] back your
[10:42] chair if you can get your chair back
[10:44] what else can God give back to you um
[10:48] I'm looking forward to having my cabin
[10:49] in northern
[10:53] Minnesota and so these these things that
[10:57] God God God
[11:00] let's talk about giving gifts we have
[11:02] this idea it's not it's the thought that
[11:05] counts and we put everything off to just
[11:07] the thought that counts but you have to
[11:09] know that giving a gift is actually an
[11:11] extension of yourself to that person so
[11:14] when you give a gift you're actually
[11:16] extending yourself out to that person so
[11:18] when God gives a gift to us he's
[11:21] extending his his heart out to us and we
[11:25] receive that gift as though we're
[11:27] receiving him himself right and so I
[11:31] think the same thing goes to this is God
[11:34] God knows how to give Us
[11:36] rewards things that are exactly designed
[11:40] for us as individuals and so when we
[11:43] when we get to the other side we can
[11:46] definitely expect that God's going to
[11:48] give us and even redeem things for us
[11:51] that we lost that we didn't even
[11:52] remember and it takes us back to that
[11:54] moment and we think my
[11:57] goodness God God loves knew me this much
[12:00] and loved me this much that this thing
[12:02] that I lost and meant so much to me here
[12:05] he's given it back to me here yes yes he
[12:09] does love us that
[12:12] much
[12:16] amen and God had explained brother
[12:18] brandom says and I used to tell the
[12:20] people I I never could sing oh my I was
[12:22] a million miles from that but I said if
[12:24] you ever get over in heaven and live in
[12:25] your big Palace you know up there I said
[12:27] way down at the bottom of the hill back
[12:29] in the woods back there there's a little
[12:31] cabin set there will be mine and one of
[12:33] these mornings when you walk out on the
[12:34] porch and hear somebody standing up
[12:36] there singing Amazing Grace How Sweet
[12:38] the Sound saved a Wretch like Me you say
[12:40] praise God old brother brandham finally
[12:41] made it it will it will be me over there
[12:45] listing trying to sing amen so again God
[12:50] knows how to
[12:52] cater each thing to the kind of person
[12:55] he's made us to be I think brother
[12:57] brandom talks about he he knew would
[12:59] enjoy certain people would enjoy
[13:01] mountains so he made mountains that way
[13:03] he knew people would enjoy the desert I
[13:05] don't know who but people enjoy the
[13:08] desert so brother Matt enjoys the desert
[13:11] so he made a desert he made Lakes he
[13:14] made streams he made made all the
[13:17] different uh types of nature because he
[13:20] knew that we would enjoy it that way so
[13:22] if you think like that and understand
[13:24] that way God will do the same for you if
[13:27] if you're the kind of person that Jo
[13:28] enjoys a little cabin amongst the pine
[13:31] trees well that's the kind of that's
[13:33] you're going to get that if you're the
[13:34] kind of person that enjoys a big old
[13:36] Palace you're going to get that some
[13:38] people will have a palace some some
[13:40] people will have a
[13:41] little little Shack in the woods amen I
[13:45] like to have a mix I have a big Palace
[13:48] that's that's a cabin in the woods in
[13:51] the mountains on a lake amen but these
[13:54] are the things God has designed us in a
[13:56] certain way to enjoy certain things and
[13:58] those are are going to be what our
[14:00] rewards
[14:04] are Revelation 21:4 and God shall wipe
[14:08] away all tears from their eyes and there
[14:10] shall be no more death neither sorrow
[14:13] nor crying neither shall there be any
[14:15] more pain for the former things are
[14:19] passed
[14:20] away and when he had opened the fifth
[14:23] seal I under saw under the altar The
[14:25] Souls of them that were slain for the
[14:27] word of God and for the the testimony
[14:30] which they held and they cried with a
[14:33] loud voice saying how long oh Lord holy
[14:35] and true Dost thou not judge and avenge
[14:38] our blood on them that dwell on the
[14:40] earth and white robes were given unto
[14:42] every one of them and it was said unto
[14:43] them that they should rest yet for a
[14:45] little season until their fellow
[14:47] servants also and their Brethren that
[14:49] should be killed as they were should be
[14:53] fulfilled all right so as we look at
[14:57] these Verses first first of all
[15:01] 21:4 you know there's there's coming a
[15:04] time where all wrongs will be made
[15:08] right God will wipe away all tears from
[15:11] their eyes
[15:12] now I think as I look at this and
[15:16] contemplate
[15:18] this you know I don't in that moment
[15:23] there's a difference between tears
[15:25] because you're broken right amen andain
[15:29] pain and tears that come from
[15:33] Joy and so I think I I think what's
[15:36] going to be wiped away is all pain all
[15:39] sorrow all death crying for that but
[15:43] crying for
[15:45] Joy I mean that that's never going to go
[15:48] away that's never going to cease crying
[15:51] for
[15:52] thankfulness will never will never cease
[15:55] because we that will go on and on and on
[15:57] because we'll never stop rejoicing and
[16:00] being thankful at what God has blessed
[16:02] and prepared for
[16:06] us but there's a there is coming a time
[16:09] all wrongs will be made right not in the
[16:13] Millennium but in the new Heaven and the
[16:15] new Earth all
[16:18] right and
[16:20] so again then we looked what we talked
[16:23] about this before just kind of bringing
[16:25] things into a completion and summary you
[16:29] know Revelation 6
[16:32] 9-1 these people are aware of what's
[16:35] happening on Earth they're aware they're
[16:37] aware of the prophetic
[16:40] timetable and they're in a position
[16:42] they're still people made in the image
[16:45] of God they're there praying and asking
[16:47] God how
[16:48] long you know these are the Jewish
[16:51] Martyrs and they're asking how long
[16:54] until you judge them they they're aware
[16:56] God has not yet brought for full
[16:59] judgment on the people that dwell on the
[17:01] earth that killed them he says wait a
[17:04] little bit because they're going to have
[17:06] to kill some more of your
[17:08] brothers and and they're given white
[17:11] robes right so we understand they're
[17:15] they maintain their memories they
[17:18] they're they're the same people they
[17:20] know what happened to
[17:22] them and there there's a connection
[17:26] between who they were and who they will
[17:29] always be this isn't just in the
[17:32] intermediate Heaven as we've talked
[17:34] about this is in the new Heaven and new
[17:35] earth some people think he'll wipe away
[17:38] all tears from our eyes it means we'll
[17:40] have no more memory no then what in the
[17:43] world did God redeem us and bring us
[17:46] through sorrow and suffering to manifest
[17:49] himself for if we have no memory of it
[17:51] anymore it doesn't make any sense he
[17:54] wants us to always remember it who who
[17:57] will Jesus be who is who is he referred
[17:59] to in the Book of Revelation in the new
[18:01] Heaven and the new Earth the lamb why is
[18:04] he referred to as the lamb because he
[18:06] was slain from the foundation of the
[18:08] world for us I believe he'll have scars
[18:12] in his side and in his hands for all of
[18:15] eternity so that we'll remember that
[18:17] we're there because of him
[18:21] Hallelujah Luke 16 verse
[18:25] 19 the parable the rich man in Lazarus
[18:29] there was a certain rich man which was
[18:31] clothed in purple and fine linen and
[18:32] fared sumptuously every day and there
[18:35] was a certain beggar named Lazarus which
[18:37] was laid at his gate full of
[18:39] sores and Desiring to be fed with the
[18:41] crumbs which fell from the rich man's
[18:43] table moreover the dogs came and licked
[18:44] his sorce and it came to pass that the
[18:47] beggar died and was carried by the
[18:48] Angels into Abraham's bosom the rich man
[18:52] also died and was buried and in hell he
[18:54] lift up his eyes being in torments and
[18:56] seeth Abraham AAR off and Lazarus in his
[18:59] bosom and he cried and said Father
[19:01] Abraham have mercy on me and send
[19:02] Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his
[19:04] finger in water and cool my tongue for I
[19:07] am tormented in this flame but Abraham
[19:11] said Son remember that thou in thy
[19:12] lifetime receivest good things and
[19:15] likewise Lazarus evil things but now he
[19:17] is comforted and thou art tormented
[19:19] beside all this between us and you there
[19:21] is a great Gulf fixed so that they which
[19:23] would pass from hence to you cannot
[19:25] neither can they pass to us that would
[19:27] come from
[19:29] then then he said I pray thee therefore
[19:31] father that thou wouldest send him to my
[19:33] father's house for I have five Brethren
[19:35] that he may testify unto them lest they
[19:37] also come into this place of Torment
[19:41] Abraham saith unto him they have Moses
[19:42] and the prophets let them hear them so
[19:46] we see in this case again it's from a
[19:50] long time ago so it's worth
[19:52] repeating even the rich man who is in
[19:55] Hell still had a connection and feeling
[19:59] for his family so there's still that
[20:03] connection in in the in the next life
[20:06] let's put it that way there's still that
[20:09] connection for
[20:10] us we we love our family we want to we
[20:14] want to make sure that they're okay just
[20:16] like those saints were there you know
[20:20] it's it's it's a shame that we have this
[20:23] super spiritual idea of Heaven that
[20:26] wipes away the familial connections that
[20:29] we have as though we're going to go to
[20:30] heaven and it'll be just like well every
[20:32] once in a while you see your wife and
[20:34] you're just like oh hey I remember
[20:37] you no it's not going to be like that
[20:40] there's that family connection that
[20:43] remains if for somebody in
[20:45] Hell how much more for someone in heaven
[20:50] will that relationship be right because
[20:52] everything everything will be purified
[20:54] now all of our relationships are
[20:57] troubled by selfish nness and pride and
[21:00] but then that's all done away with when
[21:03] you're in that body and so there's that
[21:05] there remains that connection and as we
[21:08] talked about before the great cloud of
[21:10] witnesses that surrounds us that knows
[21:11] what we're going through if you if you
[21:13] go back to the vision that we thought
[21:15] about with um sister hope and brother
[21:19] brandham she knew he was worried about
[21:22] yeah
[21:23] amen them and so she could advise
[21:27] because she was aware of what was
[21:28] Happening Now does God let let our
[21:30] family see everything that's going on
[21:32] and there's no way of knowing that
[21:36] really but somehow they they knew maybe
[21:39] they just know in general I don't know
[21:42] but somehow they knew and she knew what
[21:44] to speak specifically to him how did
[21:47] that work did God instruct her did we
[21:50] don't actually have the details we just
[21:52] know that God G at least gives a glimpse
[21:54] to them on the other side wow
[22:00] so let's look at what our bodies will be
[22:04] like again I think all of us are
[22:07] probably aware of different things that
[22:09] brother brandom said but I want
[22:12] to I want to review them I think the
[22:14] thing is what what ends up happening is
[22:17] uh even in the message we get Traditions
[22:20] that build around something just because
[22:23] so and so said it for 25 years and he
[22:25] never went back to the original quote
[22:27] and he realized he was just
[22:29] and everybody else started doing the
[22:30] same thing because of course this is
[22:31] brother so- and so and so go back to the
[22:34] original source and I think
[22:36] anything any anytime you have a certain
[22:40] subject or topic or something that we
[22:42] hold dear if you forget the reason why
[22:46] behind it event eventually you're going
[22:48] to let go of it it itself
[22:54] anyways all right so uh demonology for
[22:58] from the religious
[22:59] realm says not old no more that was
[23:02] Abraham and Sarah and they vanished look
[23:04] they looked somebody's watching us they
[23:06] could vanish just like he went through
[23:08] the wall the same kind of a body
[23:10] Hallelujah right here is all the
[23:12] prophets walking around looking around
[23:15] the
[23:15] city all right in questions and answers
[23:18] now the first things happens when we're
[23:20] resurrected the ones which are living uh
[23:23] will just REM still still remain the
[23:25] resurrection will set in first the
[23:27] resurrection of those that are asleep
[23:29] there'll be Awakening time and those
[23:31] which are asleep in the dust now but
[23:34] those that are asleep in sin CU they
[23:35] sleep right on they don't awake for
[23:37] another thousand years but those are
[23:38] sleeping in the dust will be awakened
[23:41] first these corruptible bodies will put
[23:43] on incorruption in the rapturing grace
[23:45] of the Lord and then we'll all get
[23:48] together and we begin and then and when
[23:50] they begin to get together then we which
[23:53] are alive and remain shall be changed
[23:55] these mortal bodies will not see death
[23:57] but just of a sudden there'll be like a
[23:59] sweep go over us and you'll be changed
[24:02] you're turned back like Abraham was from
[24:04] an old man to a young man from an old
[24:06] woman to a young woman what's this
[24:08] sudden changed after a while you're
[24:09] traveling like a thought and you could
[24:11] see those then who are already
[24:13] resurrected oh what a hour then will
[24:15] gather with them and then be caught up
[24:17] with them to meet the Lord in the
[24:20] air in an uncertain sound Jesus after he
[24:23] had been glorified and received his
[24:24] glorified body raised up from the dead
[24:26] and ascended on high to the father come
[24:28] back in a few seconds later and with
[24:30] such terrific speed till he come right
[24:32] in before his disciples through a wall
[24:34] and never even moved the wall and yet
[24:36] with a body that could stand there and
[24:38] eat fish and bread that speed coming
[24:41] through wow
[24:44] amen all all right
[24:48] so I want to just make this comment and
[24:51] and liken on our bodies unto this
[24:56] is it isn't a Wonder
[24:59] that Jesus in a resurrected body
[25:01] could appear to them and do those things
[25:05] that he could do um we look at at we we
[25:09] and in when I say we those in history
[25:11] and in the past have looked at that body
[25:14] as a spiritual type of
[25:15] body and not a physical form of a body
[25:21] through through time and through history
[25:24] and the reality is if if you actually
[25:27] look at it maybe maybe we are the ones
[25:29] that are actually the
[25:32] ghosts and they're in the real form yes
[25:36] that that we're actually supposed to be
[25:38] in
[25:40] so when Jesus can eat bread and fish in
[25:43] a resurrected body the Wonder is how
[25:45] does someone in the real place eat
[25:49] something that's in the unreal place
[25:52] because that's the that's how we should
[25:54] look at it we're not the substance we're
[25:57] just the shadow yeah I'm not saying
[25:59] we're ghosts don't get me
[26:01] wrong but I'm saying if you think about
[26:04] that substance versus
[26:07] Shadow Jesus body resurrected body is
[26:10] the is the substance it's the real thing
[26:14] that we're based off of we're actually
[26:16] just a Corruption of that and so when
[26:20] the two become one when this body joins
[26:22] up with the theophany then that becomes
[26:25] a glor glorified body then we're in the
[26:28] condition that we're supposed to be in
[26:32] all right now let's let's look at the
[26:35] next quote from the seed is not air with
[26:38] the
[26:39] Shu this is Brother brandom speaking
[26:41] about his um experience when he was
[26:44] praying in the brush Harbor in the spot
[26:47] before the brandom Tabernacle was built
[26:50] and he saw a vision of the Lord Jesus
[26:54] then I thought maybe I'll call him when
[26:55] I said Jesus he turned his head and when
[26:57] he looked at me me he just raised his
[26:59] arms out that's all I remember for about
[27:01] nearly daylight I was laying right out
[27:03] there right out here somewhere where
[27:05] this place is now in the field my pajama
[27:07] shirt all wet with tears where I had
[27:09] been crying and I had passed
[27:10] out his face had characters that no
[27:13] artist could draw or paint they could
[27:15] not do it he looked like a man that if
[27:17] you could look at him he wanted to cry
[27:19] with sympathy and respect with reverence
[27:21] and yet with enough power that would
[27:22] speak it would turn the world over and
[27:25] the characters could never be caught by
[27:27] an artist all right so let's look at
[27:31] some of the aspects of what our bodies
[27:34] will be like we'll be able to just use
[27:37] our modern terminology we'll be able to
[27:39] teleport from one place to another just
[27:42] by a thought you'll be instantly
[27:44] somewhere else we will obviously we're
[27:47] going to be in an actual body the real
[27:49] substance
[27:51] body but we'll able to be able to pass
[27:53] through walls and objects as we so
[27:57] desire it'll be immortal so in other
[28:01] words you're not even it's you can't
[28:02] kill
[28:05] it next we'll have the ability to speak
[28:09] a world into and out of existence not
[28:12] that we will use that but that we're
[28:15] capable of creation and destruction in
[28:19] another place brother Bram says we'll be
[28:20] able to fly at terrific speeds from one
[28:23] place to another so I don't know
[28:26] sometimes you'll fly and sometimes
[28:27] you'll tell teleport I
[28:29] guess depends on what you want to
[28:33] do all
[28:37] right is there time in
[28:40] heaven well in the current Heaven sure
[28:44] we told that there was silence in heaven
[28:46] for how long the space of half an
[28:48] hour the Jewish Saints under the altar
[28:50] were told rest for a little
[28:53] season we're also shown that there is a
[28:55] progression of time on Earth also think
[28:58] about back to the very beginning when
[29:01] God made Adam and Eve that was the
[29:03] paradise what did he what did he put in
[29:05] the heavens the Sun the moon the stars
[29:08] they were for what times and seasons and
[29:12] years
[29:14] so we will be not limited by time but
[29:19] there there will still be a progression
[29:22] of Life yes amen just like there was at
[29:25] the beginning remember the Heaven and
[29:28] the new Earth is not a not new in that
[29:32] sense it's a
[29:33] restoration back to the way it was
[29:35] originally with Satan wiped off the
[29:40] scene so when God created the heavens
[29:44] and the
[29:44] Earth it was in the beginning time God
[29:49] created the Heaven space and Earth
[29:52] matter in the same instant time space
[29:55] and matter were created so they all
[29:56] actually go along with each
[30:00] other and so they all go together and
[30:03] the new Earth will be that paradise
[30:07] restored back to us all
[30:12] right so let's let me see where I got
[30:15] here yes CS
[30:19] Lewis says this
[30:22] about I'm I'm thinking of this in
[30:24] regards to the type of body we'll have
[30:27] it's a serious thing to live in a
[30:28] society of possible gods and goddesses
[30:31] to remember that the dullest most
[30:33] uninteresting person you can talk to May
[30:35] one day be a creature which if you saw
[30:37] it now you would be strongly tempted to
[30:41] worship take that from John
