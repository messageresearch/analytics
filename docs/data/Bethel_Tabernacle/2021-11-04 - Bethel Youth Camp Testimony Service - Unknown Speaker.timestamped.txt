[35:08] actually live streamed i know many of
[35:09] you

[35:12] that was a less than ideal situation
[35:15] how brother mike and brother george
[35:16] pulled that off i'm really not even sure
[35:18] but
[35:19] we they kept messing around with it
[35:21] until it got good enough amen so i hope
[35:24] you were able to watch it uh from home
[35:26] regardless of that
[35:28] we should have it all on the archives
[35:30] now the archives are jacked up just a
[35:32] little bit so brother matt's going to
[35:34] work on those and
[35:35] get them

[36:02] and i have uh her with her family and
[36:05] her dad brother brother danny um is it
[36:08] manitoba am i thinking i'm getting
[36:10] old-timers a little bit so
[36:12] but i was up there in the land of milk
[36:15] and honey is what they call it you
[36:17] didn't think i'd remember that did you
[36:18] and uh for real though it really is they
[36:20] get they uh they they have a reason for
[36:22] saying that
[36:24] but
[36:25] i was up there visiting ministering some
[36:26] services with brother eugene
[36:28] which is brother-in-law two brother
[36:30] danny so
[36:32] sister joanna is his niece
[36:34] and uh she had a horse named sunny
[36:37] beautiful wow beautiful horse was sunny
[36:40] a palomino
[36:41] just a gorgeous animal and i love
[36:44] animals of all kind and i went to when i
[36:46] said hey can i ride this horse sure go
[36:48] right ahead so me and sonny took off
[36:50] into the wilderness
[36:52] and i knew sonny knew you know was it
[36:54] was he a boy or a girl
[36:57] a gelding so what is that
[37:00] okay he was gelding
[37:03] so me and this gelding took off
[37:05] and we rode through the wilderness and
[37:07] uh i ended up at a at an old quarry
[37:10] looked like um
[37:12] they had been quarrying stone out of the
[37:14] ground or something and so sonny and i
[37:16] are just you know and i consider myself
[37:17] a pretty good uh
[37:20] horseman or rider of horses but even i
[37:22] don't know what a gelding is but
[37:26] i think i know amen
[37:28] but we were riding along the edge
[37:31] and the earth gave way
[37:33] and me and sonny went into the deep
[37:36] amen and uh you know i'm not a panicky
[37:39] type of person
[37:40] and i immediately knew
[37:42] you know i i'll never be able to get out
[37:44] of here because uh the ground is giving
[37:46] away but i knew sonny had four-wheel
[37:47] drive
[37:48] so i just held on to the horn and sure
[37:51] enough sonny pulled
[37:53] him herself up
[37:56] out of the
[37:57] out of the uh out of the water and took
[38:00] me with her
[38:01] and when i got on the ground i i let go
[38:03] and sonny took off
[38:05] and i'll tell you what that horse ran
[38:07] about i would say 20 or 30 yards just
[38:10] hard away i thought man i'm gonna have a
[38:11] long walk home
[38:13] and that horse just took off running and
[38:15] just stopped about 30 yards and dug in
[38:17] and wheeled around and come back to me
[38:20] and just let me have it i mean i
[38:23] couldn't speak horse but whatever
[38:26] whatever sonny was saying
[38:28] that horse was not happy
[38:30] and i mean he was right in my face
[38:32] letting me know it and i'm sorry sonny
[38:34] i'm so sorry i got too close to the edge
[38:36] and
[38:38] oh my so i remember that uh really well
[38:41] amen i'm glad i survived it praise the
[38:44] lord
[38:45] so where we have some a lot of history
[38:48] with brother eugene and sister sarah and
[38:50] through them we met brother danny and
[38:52] his wife and
[38:53] went there and and all all of his family
[38:56] and a wonderful church there we
[38:57] ministered in years and years and years
[38:58] ago one of my one of my
[39:01] greatest uh deliverances of something
[39:05] because of a deep trial
[39:07] that i was current that i was in because
[39:10] of something that had happened in this
[39:12] church many years ago and just one of
[39:14] those pastor things where you just uh
[39:17] boy you almost don't even know what to
[39:19] do you you don't know whether to go
[39:21] forward back up sit still or run away
[39:23] and
[39:24] you know i i it was affecting the church
[39:27] and i didn't even realize it i couldn't
[39:29] figure out what was wrong with the
[39:30] church it seemed to be under a cloud
[39:31] this for most of all y'all this is back
[39:33] in the day
[39:35] and not too many of the old original
[39:37] gang left but
[39:39] but uh it was a real real deep trial had
[39:42] some real personal things that happened
[39:44] and come against me and a lot of things
[39:46] like that and i was in a lot of pain a
[39:48] lot of pain and the whole church
[39:51] was just getting
[39:53] darker and darker
[39:55] and darker and i couldn't figure out
[39:57] what was wrong because i knew the
[39:58] scripture
[40:00] promised that
[40:01] you shall know the truth and the truth
[40:04] shall the truth shall make you free
[40:06] not not you know not you'll be free
[40:09] it'll make you free and so i i doubled
[40:12] back and i started looking through all
[40:14] of my material i said lord i'm i'm going
[40:16] back i'm i know i'm preaching the word i
[40:18] know i'm preaching it according to
[40:19] malachi 4. i know i'm on the i know i'm
[40:22] doing that why
[40:24] is it not liberating why is it going
[40:26] down and down and down
[40:28] and uh we preached those services
[40:31] and uh i don't even know if i've ever
[40:32] told your dad this testimony but but
[40:35] there in those services brother eugene
[40:36] preached the last one for me
[40:38] and you know i thought that i went up
[40:40] there to preach some services but
[40:42] actually i went up there not knowing it
[40:44] but i went up there to hear brother
[40:45] eugene preach the last service
[40:47] and when he preached it he literally cut
[40:50] right down into the into the quick of it
[40:53] and
[40:54] he he began to talk about
[40:57] that you can only give out
[40:59] what's in you
[41:01] and and that's it that's the only
[41:03] genuine thing you have anything else is
[41:05] fake
[41:06] and so whatever's in you is really the
[41:08] only genuine authentic thing that can
[41:11] that you can give out and that's fine if
[41:14] your spirit is in good shape and your
[41:16] mind is in good shape your emotions are
[41:17] in good shape and and your faith is in
[41:19] good shape and you're and everything but
[41:22] if you're hurt if you're wounded if
[41:24] you're crying if you're dark then what
[41:28] happens is that's going to project
[41:31] because i learned a lesson many years
[41:32] ago from brother lonnie spirits travel
[41:34] on words
[41:37] and so even though i was preaching the
[41:39] word that spirit of hurt and wound in me
[41:43] was hopping on the word writing it like
[41:45] a pony
[41:46] into the ears of the people down into
[41:48] their hearts and contaminating my own
[41:51] congregation
[41:53] i didn't even know that could happen
[41:55] i i and when brother eugene preached
[41:57] that it was just like an epiphany and i
[42:00] was just blown
[42:01] away
[42:02] and in a moment and i mean just just
[42:05] like that god revealed to me
[42:08] what was wrong and it was in my own
[42:11] heart and i had to
[42:13] i had to uh
[42:15] i had to jettison that
[42:17] i had to get rid of that i had to let my
[42:19] heart be clean and clear because i
[42:20] couldn't help anybody everybody around
[42:23] me was being wounded
[42:25] the people i cared about the most this
[42:27] church my family being wounded and uh i
[42:30] don't even know why i'm telling the
[42:31] story i haven't thought about it in
[42:32] years maybe
[42:34] you're here tonight but it brings it all
[42:36] back and i'm gonna tell you something
[42:37] friends i came back with just the power
[42:39] of that revelation and i just thought
[42:42] you devil you're not gonna get to i'm
[42:44] not gonna grant that anymore you're gone
[42:46] you're out of here and i put that thing
[42:49] out of my mind and i've cleaned out my
[42:51] heart before the lord and the lord come
[42:52] down and anointed me i sit in that
[42:54] service for a long time weeping and when
[42:56] i came home i went right back to
[42:58] preaching the same word i had preached
[43:00] before i left and all of a sudden the
[43:02] sun came out and the clouds moved back
[43:04] and the church started to lift and rise
[43:05] and like a breeze come in and and and
[43:08] everybody got free
[43:10] and i'll tell you something friends that
[43:11] was a lesson that i'll never forget to
[43:13] this day you this is why you must never
[43:16] allow your heart and mind to become
[43:18] contaminated with life
[43:21] see
[43:21] paul has a recommendation that if that
[43:23] should happen to you just all you got to
[43:25] do is drop back and here's here was
[43:27] where my failure was he said just drop
[43:29] back and consider him who suffered such
[43:32] contradiction of sinners against himself
[43:35] the one who was innocent the one who had
[43:36] never done anything wrong and god traded
[43:39] him for a bunch of a bunch of sinners
[43:41] like us
[43:43] and he said and paul said think about
[43:44] him and what he the the wrong how he was
[43:47] wrong lest you be wearied
[43:49] and faint
[43:50] amen
[43:52] and so you know um it it was such a a
[43:55] lesson of liberation i was i was
[43:58] speaking on i'm gonna i'm gonna read my
[44:00] text here in a minute but and i'm just
[44:02] kind of going along under anointing i
[44:04] didn't have any of that plan to say it's
[44:05] not in my notes anywhere i haven't even
[44:07] opened my notes
[44:09] but
[44:10] uh
[44:11] but you know it it ironically it goes
[44:14] exactly along with
[44:16] what the lord spoke to me at home
[44:19] and what he spoke to me fresh standing
[44:21] on that landing just where i walked in
[44:22] the door before i was sorry any of your
[44:24] faces the lord met me right there and
[44:27] said you need to go to philippians
[44:44] oh
[45:00] i just
[45:16] is
[45:24] [Laughter]
[45:33] misunderstandings
[46:10] a
[46:14] oh
[46:38] okay
[46:55] the terrible situation that's going to
[46:57] befall the world and i've said it to you
[46:59] here before i said it
[47:01] to the young people there are as we
[47:03] speak right now in real time happening
[47:05] in real time there's an irreversible
[47:09] truth an irrevocable uh reality that
[47:13] there are for the world and i hate to be
[47:16] the bearer of bad tidings but to this
[47:18] world the bible is clear there are
[47:21] catastrophic judgments rushing to meet
[47:24] us
[47:25] and the only way out is up
[47:29] amen
[47:30] you can't run east and west north and
[47:32] south there's nowhere you go in the
[47:34] earth he won't do you any good to to go
[47:37] underground into a bunker you're gonna
[47:39] the only way to get out of this is going
[47:42] up
[47:44] and so i i like that song i'm going in
[47:46] the rapture
[47:47] amen and and daniel when he's talking
[47:50] about that and all the things that the
[47:52] antichrist system will do he drops a
[47:54] little notation under prophecy
[47:57] it's almost like almost marooned
[48:00] because it's right in the middle of
[48:02] horrible descriptions of what's going to
[48:04] happen under judgments but he said the
[48:06] people
[48:07] during that time
[48:09] that the people who know their god will
[48:12] do great exploits
[48:14] and i just say i'm that people
[48:17] are you that people tonight to say right
[48:19] here at the time i'm gonna do great
[48:21] exploits what's the greatest exploit you
[48:23] can do press
[48:25] press toward the mark throw off
[48:27] everything of the world get everything
[48:29] out of your life anything that hinders
[48:31] you you cannot live in this day hindered
[48:35] it's too hard thank you kindly y'all
[48:37] y'all can go amen
[48:39] young man knows his daddy
[48:42] so it's
[48:44] it's time to press
[48:46] it's time to matter
[48:48] it's time to stand up and be counted
[48:50] it's time to stand for the truth of this
[48:53] hour i believe that we're living in that
[48:56] time amen
[48:58] one of the things they did that wasn't
[49:00] streamed was they did a skit
[49:02] that uh sister deborah put together
[49:04] largely and
[49:05] all the team coalesced around her and
[49:08] uh
[49:09] and and rehearsed it and practiced it
[49:12] and
[49:12] and they put it on there
[49:14] uh at the youth camp and wow i i just
[49:17] man say it backwards wow
[49:19] it it i was stunned i it was so amazing
[49:24] and and we find that
[49:26] it was a story
[49:28] about a prophecy about a a boy king who
[49:31] would come to the throne
[49:33] and jeroboam was causing israel to sin
[49:37] and and and and idolatry was entering
[49:40] the land jeroboam is the one who took
[49:41] the ten tribes away from rehoboam and
[49:44] went into samaria the northern kingdom
[49:45] became the northern kingdom of israel
[49:47] and judah
[49:48] remained true there with the city of
[49:50] david and
[49:51] rehoboam the son of solomon carried on
[49:54] but both of them finally
[49:56] you know it got so bad that
[49:58] that they came in and and took
[50:01] northern israel and took the ten tribes
[50:04] captive a hundred years prior and then
[50:06] finally it comes down and judah's still
[50:09] there
[50:10] and they they raise up a king
[50:12] by the name of josiah
[50:15] and it's incredible when he when he took
[50:18] the throne at eight years old
[50:21] at eight years old josiah took the
[50:23] throne a boy king
[50:25] and he had been pursued because there
[50:28] was an evil woman trying to assassinate
[50:31] all of the royal lineage because she had
[50:33] she had you know she had uh her own
[50:36] ambitions for the for the power herself
[50:38] and so we find that some righteous
[50:41] people hid the child away and held him
[50:43] for eight years until they he was just
[50:45] old enough to bring him to the throne
[50:46] and crown him and blow a trumpet and all
[50:49] all judah would then receive that which
[50:52] is what they did and then she had a sad
[50:54] ending herself and so
[50:56] which is always going to be true when
[50:58] you come against god's word
[51:01] and when he comes
[51:02] you know he's he's 8 years old and
[51:04] obviously he had been raised with some
[51:07] morals i tell you there's value in
[51:09] raising your children with morals
[51:12] there's value with teaching them uh you
[51:14] know put put some value in their life
[51:17] about what's right and what's wrong and
[51:20] that right and wrong matter
[51:22] because that's what's absent today
[51:24] nobody cares what's right wrong all
[51:26] things are relative
[51:27] everything's right everything's fine
[51:28] it's all in the eye of the beholder but
[51:30] the thing they lose sight of it is in
[51:33] the eye of the beholder but only one
[51:35] beholder
[51:37] there's only one eye judging it and it's
[51:39] not the eye of the person it's the i
[51:42] above who sees all and knows all and
[51:45] judges all
[51:46] and that's where the world is going to
[51:48] get a rude awakening and and and so this
[51:51] boy king comes to the throne he's
[51:52] already got a heart
[51:54] to know the lord and
[51:56] and by the time he's 16
[52:08] all right
[52:27] everywhere
[52:34] foreign
[53:22] [Laughter]
[53:30] opinion to worry about i mean he's a
[53:32] king but there could be a revolt when
[53:33] you've got ungodly people you never know
[53:34] what's going to happen
[53:37] and he's he starts a renovation project
[53:39] on the temple and while they're
[53:41] renovating it they find an original
[53:43] scroll of moses the original and they
[53:46] bring it and give it to his officer and
[53:48] his officer comes and now he's moving
[53:50] toward 20 years old so at 8 years old at
[53:52] 16 years old at 18 years old and now
[53:55] he's 20. now he's now he's he's so
[53:58] zealous because now he's got the lord
[53:59] he's terrified because he knows no one
[54:01] has read this thing in a long time and
[54:02] nobody's keeping it
[54:04] and he starts reestablishing the
[54:06] passover and he starts taking down the
[54:08] groves and he starts firing all the old
[54:10] priests and starts putting in new men of
[54:12] god i mean this is a national revival
[54:16] now it's it's interesting because the
[54:18] people really aren't it's not really in
[54:20] their heart as a majority because as
[54:22] soon as he dies they go right back to
[54:24] idolatry almost immediately under his
[54:25] son
[54:26] so it was a it was a regulated
[54:30] uh
[54:31] why
[54:32] yeah i know
[54:34] you you need me to use it
[54:39] yeah okay
[54:44] okay it's on you just you need me to
[54:45] preach to it
[54:47] okay
[54:48] gonna tie one hand behind my back
[54:53] oh gideon what i'm already preaching too
[54:55] long what are you pointing at your watch
[54:57] oh for the online audience very good
[54:59] okay praise the lord
[55:02] okay
[55:03] i thought he's doing like my dad
[55:09] brother eddie was a little more crafty
[55:10] than that he'd wear his watch upside
[55:11] down and i'd see me just kind of go
[55:17] but he's
[55:18] he's zealous for god
[55:21] and he starts pressing now what's
[55:22] amazing is
[55:24] that when jeroboam
[55:27] was bringing the nation into such sin
[55:30] and idolatry
[55:31] there was a man of god that came up out
[55:33] of judah
[55:35] and stood at an altar of one of the
[55:37] idolatrous gods he was worshiping
[55:40] and right as jeroboam was you know he's
[55:42] like the king and he's doing a religious
[55:44] ceremony he's offering to this false god
[55:46] and the man of god starts to prophesy
[55:48] against the altar
[55:50] and this is what they did in the play
[55:52] this is this was the whole scene
[55:55] of how that of how that he prophesied
[55:58] against that altar and said
[56:01] someday this altar
[56:03] will hold the bodies and bones of the
[56:06] priest who are sacrificing on it and
[56:09] they will be sacrificed on it and god
[56:11] will destroy this altar and he'll raise
[56:13] up a king by the name of josiah it's one
[56:16] of the only times in the bible where it
[56:18] literally named it that far in advance
[56:20] say so josiah was josiah on the scene no
[56:25] so he's like 10 years out no
[56:28] 15 no 20 no
[56:32] 290 years later
[56:36] you can imagine by this time nobody
[56:38] still believed that prophecy
[56:40] you can imagine by this time nobody
[56:42] thought to play where they're gonna have
[56:43] a king named josiah it's
[56:45] 290 years later
[56:48] and a boy king comes to the throne
[56:50] and he's full of the zeal of the lord
[56:52] and he's so disturbed when he reads the
[56:55] law of moses he don't even know what to
[56:56] do about it and he calls forth a
[56:58] prophetess
[57:22] oh
[57:27] foreign
[57:49] foreign
[58:26] is
[58:48] what

[59:42] [Music]
[59:45] a deborah jackson film amen
[59:49] amen
[59:52] [Applause]
[59:55] and you know i watched god move
[59:57] at that meeting and i watched i i i have
[1:00:00] to sit back now and in my mind's eye and
[1:00:03] wonder
[1:00:04] lord surely you had some josiahs
[1:00:07] those 370 or whatever campers we had and
[1:00:11] and then uh uh seemed like an
[1:00:12] innumerable host of helpers and
[1:00:14] counselors
[1:00:15] uh but i'm wondering i want to say lord
[1:00:18] what great things you have done
[1:00:21] and so you know i want to just commend
[1:00:24] our young people for being willing
[1:00:26] to to come to a camp like that you'd be
[1:00:29] you'd be amazed at the aversion that
[1:00:31] some young teenagers have
[1:00:33] um brother caleb in his wonderful
[1:00:35] reprisal of the role of the of the young
[1:00:38] man who
[1:01:56] from the teenagers themselves i've heard
[1:01:58] pastors and ministers and people have
[1:01:59] written even from overseas and told me
[1:02:02] how much and what a blessing it has been
[1:02:05] but tonight i want to give
[1:02:07] uh the teenagers who are willing to take
[1:02:09] apart i'm going to bring them all up
[1:02:10] here with travis and deborah and as many
[1:02:12] of them as want to give
[1:02:14] a minute or so half a minute of just
[1:02:17] testimony and reflections of what god
[1:02:19] did
[1:02:20] for them amen so at this time brother
[1:02:23] travis you and sister deborah come on up
[1:02:25] and all all you campers come on up amen

[1:03:29] i'll let him use this one okay and i'll
[1:03:31] just hand it to him okay brother george
[1:03:32] thank you
[1:03:34] brother travis you're going to start
[1:03:36] first no preaching
[1:03:40] yeah so that music that i heard um
[1:03:43] really magical like you're going to
[1:03:45] disney world or something
[1:03:47] and you
[1:03:48] it's funny because you go to disney
[1:03:49] world you're expecting something like
[1:03:51] majestic and magical and you get there
[1:03:53] and you realize there's a bunch of
[1:03:54] characters and it's just a facade but i
[1:03:57] can say that when we went to camp it
[1:04:00] really was magical
[1:04:02] you could tell that it was something was
[1:04:04] happening
[1:04:05] before and after the camp
[1:04:08] the devil fought
[1:04:09] it's pretty wild how you see the devil
[1:04:12] move before
[1:04:13] and then during camp you can't find the
[1:04:15] devil anywhere it's just he was nowhere
[1:04:18] to be found but then right on the way
[1:04:20] home it's just like here he is again
[1:04:23] i had the easiest job probably in the
[1:04:25] whole camp i just got to hang out with
[1:04:26] the kids and just play basketball eat
[1:04:29] food so it was great for me but what one
[1:04:32] thing that i uh i can i can
[1:04:34] i didn't notice this before but the
[1:04:37] people who
[1:04:38] earn the most credit are the ones that
[1:04:40] you don't see their faces
[1:04:43] the ones that are behind the scene and
[1:04:44] it's amazing to
[1:04:47] to see this camp unfold i know my wife
[1:04:50] deborah
[1:04:51] put so much work into it and i i really
[1:04:54] appreciate but
[1:04:56] single handedly she has
[1:04:58] uh you know
[1:05:00] put on so much um
[1:05:03] effort and and
[1:05:05] the skit was impressive i'm sure you've
[1:05:07] seen it online but uh hey i'm just gonna
[1:05:09] hand it over to her and let her continue
[1:05:11] on
[1:05:13] there you go i want a young person to go
[1:05:15] first
[1:05:17] well i actually wrote some stuff down
[1:05:19] and i
[1:05:20] will try to go super fast i can probably
[1:05:22] i could probably cut some of it out
[1:05:25] i wanted to start if i can with just a
[1:05:27] really quick little testimony
[1:05:30] i told some of you but when we were
[1:05:32] first starting to think about this camp
[1:05:35] we decided that there were some things
[1:05:36] that were really important to us and i
[1:05:39] mean i say we i really wasn't a part of
[1:05:41] the idea of the camp that was all
[1:05:42] brother matt brother jason to mars but
[1:05:45] um you know they got just a little group
[1:05:47] of us together after the um the youth
[1:05:49] event that we had and one of the big
[1:05:51] things was we wanted
[1:05:53] to hand pick all the counselors which is
[1:05:55] a lot harder than you might think
[1:05:58] you know everybody who was a counselor
[1:06:00] at camp had to be hand chosen by us and
[1:06:04] um
[1:06:05] you know anybody who went to a youth
[1:06:06] camp knows why that's important
[1:06:09] and
[1:06:10] i i happened to be out in flagstaff
[1:06:13] for the weekend with my mother-in-law
[1:06:15] and
[1:06:17] i bumped into
[1:06:19] some a family that we knew from when i
[1:06:21] was a kid
[1:06:23] um
[1:06:24] when i was really young and their
[1:06:25] daughters have grown up none of which
[1:06:27] have been married they're just these
[1:06:29] great christian girls and i haven't seen
[1:06:32] these girls in 15 years
[1:06:34] they they haven't seen my family in 15
[1:06:36] years and they happened to be in
[1:06:38] flagstaff the very weekend that i was
[1:06:40] there
[1:06:41] and something kept telling me ask them
[1:06:44] to be counselors ask them to be
[1:06:45] counselors but i haven't seen them in so
[1:06:46] long
[1:06:47] that i was like just kind of pushing
[1:06:49] back at that thought but i knew i knew
[1:06:52] it had to be the lord
[1:06:54] so i just kind of checked in with some
[1:06:55] other people to make sure that was okay
[1:06:57] and then i asked them
[1:06:59] and
[1:07:00] when it came down for us to assign the
[1:07:02] counselors like pretty much to the
[1:07:04] person we had the exact right number of
[1:07:06] women counselors and we were scrambling
[1:07:09] a little but for the like once we
[1:07:11] finalized it it was the exact same
[1:07:13] number which i find just crazy
[1:07:15] considering that they have like the
[1:07:17] chances of them being there they're from
[1:07:20] dallas is is so so slim that they would
[1:07:23] be there the exact same day it wasn't
[1:07:25] even the same weekend the same sunday
[1:07:27] morning that i was there and then they
[1:07:28] were gone after church
[1:07:30] so
[1:07:31] they ended up coming to church and their
[1:07:34] their dorm
[1:07:35] was so unbelievable these girls
[1:07:38] had worship services every night with
[1:07:40] the girls in their dorm they had them
[1:07:42] singing in all these different languages
[1:07:44] one of the groups of girls was sister
[1:07:46] tabby's nieces i had no idea and they
[1:07:48] formed these tight bonds with these
[1:07:51] three girls their lives are changed the
[1:07:53] girls lives are changed and i think
[1:07:55] that's just unbelievable so i know that
[1:07:57] that's probably the longest thing i have
[1:07:58] to say but
[1:08:00] um it was my privilege to be a part of
[1:08:02] this youth camp i don't feel like i did
[1:08:04] anything compared to what
[1:08:06] brother jason and sister amy did matt
[1:08:08] and rachel tony and amber
[1:08:12] brad and sarah yance chastity and doug
[1:08:14] you guys just you really
[1:08:16] i did the fun stuff i got to play music
[1:08:18] and
[1:08:20] play with the young people everybody
[1:08:21] else got to
[1:08:22] sit up all night doing the hard work
[1:08:26] you know you young people don't realize
[1:08:27] how hard we pray for you and how much we
[1:08:30] love you i know my kids are still young
[1:08:33] but
[1:08:33] we have such a burden for you guys we
[1:08:35] love you so much like you're our own
[1:08:37] kids some of you are our own kids but
[1:08:40] um to see you um you know i was playing
[1:08:43] the piano i was really close to all of
[1:08:45] you you know the prayer line and getting
[1:08:47] to see you all go up and i saw almost
[1:08:49] all of you in the prayer line and each
[1:08:51] time i saw one of you i just
[1:08:53] my heart melted and i i love you guys so
[1:08:56] much and i'm so thankful you all got to
[1:08:58] be a part of it
[1:09:00] i know that satan used the last year to
[1:09:03] create a lot of havoc and depression in
[1:09:05] our young people and
[1:09:07] i feel like the lord used the ministers
[1:09:08] time after time in every service to call
[1:09:11] that out and to demolish all demons of
[1:09:13] fear and
[1:09:15] anxiety and depression just time after
[1:09:17] time it was like that was
[1:09:19] not the main theme of camp but it was
[1:09:21] just completely utterly demolished and
[1:09:23] that was really special to me
[1:09:27] i feel like the camp was just a haven
[1:09:29] for people who've struggled through the
[1:09:31] last year
[1:09:32] and for me personally you know going
[1:09:34] through a lot with my family moving away
[1:09:36] and just a lot of personal struggles for
[1:09:39] me getting to be a part of it was
[1:09:41] just a life-changing experience
[1:09:43] definitely
[1:09:44] um i know that there were a few other
[1:09:46] goals that were talked about at the
[1:09:48] beginning of camp
[1:09:49] and i was just
[1:09:51] um
[1:09:52] i guess i won't go into them all because
[1:09:54] i'm getting a little long-winded but
[1:09:56] every single thing that we had discussed
[1:09:58] when we were planning camp that was
[1:10:00] crucially important that we wanted to
[1:10:03] accomplish through this camp
[1:10:05] just in my rounds of talking with young
[1:10:08] people and talking with other people at
[1:10:09] the camp every single one of those boxes
[1:10:11] were checked and i know that wasn't us
[1:10:13] as people that was the lord making it
[1:10:16] happen i mean even down to the exact
[1:10:18] wording of some of the stuff we said
[1:10:20] brother jason namara said
[1:10:22] the most important thing he wanted was
[1:10:23] for us to focus on teaching young people
[1:10:26] and not just
[1:10:27] you know
[1:10:28] not just some big revival service which
[1:10:30] is great and we had some of that and
[1:10:32] that's wonderful but we wanted to focus
[1:10:34] on teaching young people important
[1:10:35] things and that was one of the biggest
[1:10:37] thing
[1:10:38] things that young people kept coming up
[1:10:39] to me saying was
[1:10:41] i learned so much thank you so much for
[1:10:43] providing that to us and so i just feel
[1:10:45] like that was
[1:10:46] a really special thing
[1:10:49] and then one other personal testimony
[1:10:52] was
[1:10:55] travis was saying how satan was fighting
[1:10:57] us so badly when we got back and it was
[1:11:00] absolutely unspeakable
[1:11:02] just the amount of stress that as soon
[1:11:05] as camp was over it was like the ride
[1:11:08] home we were all just angry and tired
[1:11:11] and i'm thinking to myself this is crazy
[1:11:13] because 20 minutes before we left we're
[1:11:15] happy and laughing and joking and it was
[1:11:18] like the whole ride home
[1:11:20] satan was fighting and i've talked to so
[1:11:22] many people who were there already and
[1:11:24] just said satan was so mad
[1:11:26] that
[1:11:27] the entire day after camp it was just a
[1:11:29] constant bombarding
[1:11:31] and something really interesting
[1:11:33] happened to me last night i had to drive
[1:11:35] sarah and the boys to the airport
[1:11:37] and um
[1:11:39] you know that was a really hard thing
[1:11:41] for me to do it's hard to see them go so
[1:11:43] i kind of wanted to be alone and i've
[1:11:45] had travis keep the kids had to drive
[1:11:47] them to savannah and um
[1:11:50] i figured i would just drive home and
[1:11:52] listen to some worship music and listen
[1:11:54] to brother branham and just pray
[1:11:56] and
[1:11:57] something very strange happened to me
[1:11:59] when i dropped them off
[1:12:01] i had this wave of exhaustion that was
[1:12:04] so intense
[1:12:05] i could not keep my eyes open and i had
[1:12:07] the whole drive home the whole way down
[1:12:10] 95 i was like
[1:12:12] trying to slap myself in the face stomp
[1:12:14] my feet try to stay awake it was so
[1:12:17] intense and i
[1:12:19] i fell asleep at the wheel and it when i
[1:12:23] realized it i i shook myself awake and i
[1:12:26] pulled into the hardyville walmart
[1:12:28] thinking
[1:12:29] i i think i in the back my mind knew it
[1:12:31] was the devil i could tell it was almost
[1:12:33] like a like a supernatural blanket just
[1:12:37] causing me to fall asleep at the wheel
[1:12:39] so i reclined my chair laid back and i
[1:12:42] was just out like a light
[1:12:44] and then i sat up straight a little
[1:12:46] while later and
[1:12:48] i when i pulled in it was about 10 30
[1:12:50] something like that at night
[1:12:52] i sat up straight it was after one
[1:12:54] o'clock i think it was like 1 30
[1:12:57] and um it startled me to have slept that
[1:12:59] long so i immediately turned on the car
[1:13:02] backed out and i'm thinking i'm wide
[1:13:04] awake i'm gonna drive home
[1:13:05] and within seconds i was already just
[1:13:07] like
[1:13:08] in like falling asleep again and that
[1:13:10] has never happened to me i was it was i
[1:13:13] can't describe it i know it seems silly
[1:13:15] to some of you but i really believe
[1:13:17] satan was trying to kill me that's how
[1:13:19] intense this was
[1:13:21] so the whole way home i'm just like
[1:13:24] trying so hard to stay awake i pull onto
[1:13:26] my street and a deer jumps out
[1:13:28] right in front of me i thought i was
[1:13:30] going to clip it but
[1:13:32] i kept thinking to myself because my car
[1:13:34] it kind of drives itself a little bit
[1:13:36] and if i had just relaxed and and dozed
[1:13:39] a little bit i would have hit that car
[1:13:40] or that deer
[1:13:42] and i just you know i was thinking that
[1:13:44] through all of that i could tell satan
[1:13:45] was fighting me he was fighting us all
[1:13:47] emotionally i'm sure he was fighting all
[1:13:48] of you guys because he's so furious that
[1:13:51] you were all there and that you all did
[1:13:53] receive something from the lord and i
[1:13:54] know i did he would love nothing more to
[1:13:57] rob
[1:13:58] you of that blessing to rob your parents
[1:14:00] who worked so hard to rob them of that
[1:14:02] blessing and apparently he wants to rob
[1:14:05] me of my life as well because i feel
[1:14:07] like that very well could have happened
[1:14:09] last night so i just want to give all
[1:14:10] the glory to the lord and thank him for
[1:14:12] preserving my life and for preserving
[1:14:14] all of us and for giving us such a great
[1:14:16] time at camp
[1:14:19] [Applause]
[1:14:25] okay never mind first one second
[1:14:29] no
[1:14:30] wait we decided this is josh that was at
[1:14:32] the camp this is he's back to josh am i
[1:14:35] getting nominated yes you've been you've
[1:14:36] been
[1:14:37] pressed into into service
[1:14:41] i was hoping he goes first because he
[1:14:42] had a more articulate he has notes i
[1:14:44] don't have any of that
[1:14:46] classic twin thing of thought so we know
[1:14:48] totally different but uh
[1:14:50] yeah so camp well i had a nice
[1:14:53] crazy week before camp because um you
[1:14:56] know contracting covet is never a fun
[1:14:58] thing and i experienced that for the
[1:15:00] first time so yay
[1:15:02] so yeah two two weeks before camp but it
[1:15:04] was fun not at all uh
[1:15:07] and the whole church got covered pretty
[1:15:08] much and churches were
[1:15:10] closed down and then i had to stay home
[1:15:13] the last day of corn the last sun that
[1:15:15] we had here so i didn't get any services
[1:15:17] until that thursday night so it was it
[1:15:20] was a long time before i had been in
[1:15:22] church so that was nice in itself uh the
[1:15:25] skit oh the skit that was that was
[1:15:27] interesting uh
[1:15:30] you know uh you know deborah told me
[1:15:32] she approached me first about the skit
[1:15:34] you know i had no idea what the skit was
[1:15:36] about uh she told she told me my part
[1:15:38] said it'd be perfect for the the devil
[1:15:40] so
[1:15:42] thanks i i still don't know how to feel
[1:15:44] about that one uh
[1:15:47] but
[1:15:48] starting when we started sitting there
[1:15:50] on the drawing board trying to write it
[1:15:51] up you know i had no idea how this was
[1:15:53] going to go we didn't have a script yet
[1:15:56] we just started writing the script that
[1:15:58] day and we had a rough outline by the
[1:16:00] time i left there that
[1:16:01] uh that day i think it was a sunday
[1:16:03] evening we stayed around and tried to
[1:16:04] write a script but i had no idea how it
[1:16:08] was going to turn out you know i and
[1:16:09] then the script went through a couple
[1:16:11] changes and so that was
[1:16:14] interesting in itself and then i had one
[1:16:16] of the bigger parts so that's always
[1:16:17] nerve-racking
[1:16:19] they said caleb was the main character
[1:16:21] but in my mind i feel like i was but
[1:16:25] in my defense he sat on a bed and
[1:16:27] watched half the play because so i had
[1:16:30] the most lines so main character there
[1:16:32] we go uh but it was a lot of lines and a
[1:16:35] lot and it was like 300 some people
[1:16:38] that's definitely the yeah yeah
[1:16:40] all right yeah
[1:16:42] but um yeah the skit went
[1:16:45] phenomenally way better than i thought
[1:16:47] it was gonna it was sorry dab
[1:16:50] but it went really really well it was a
[1:16:52] super amount of blessing for everyone a
[1:16:54] lot of people told me that i did well
[1:16:56] which was nice but they also told me i
[1:16:58] played satan really well so take from
[1:17:00] that what you will uh still processing
[1:17:03] that one but
[1:17:05] um overall the uh the time i was there
[1:17:08] you know the biggest blessing to me was
[1:17:11] honestly everyone there who was running
[1:17:13] it uh i know jason said that um the uh
[1:17:17] deborah and travis are our
[1:17:18] youth parents and they really are but
[1:17:20] honestly all the adults here or
[1:17:23] yeah all i can brother jason and sister
[1:17:26] amy my mom and dad uh
[1:17:28] matt and rachel just those are the ones
[1:17:30] i can think of on the top of my head
[1:17:31] yeah i'm getting to it
[1:17:33] uh
[1:17:34] you know even aft before the camp you
[1:17:37] all these adults and or all of the youth
[1:17:40] people leading you know i felt such a
[1:17:42] strong uh feeling that you guys really
[1:17:45] want to help the youth and are working
[1:17:46] with the youth and you know you've all
[1:17:49] been an inspiration in my life even
[1:17:51] before this camp and been helping me
[1:17:53] every step of the way i've been here
[1:17:55] and you know brother jason talked about
[1:17:57] um i think was a d-day youth had that
[1:18:00] thing about yeah he was listing off all
[1:18:02] the though yeah
[1:18:04] normandy listening all the weapons and
[1:18:06] stuff that they were using you know and
[1:18:08] what i'm thinking about it is it's hard
[1:18:10] to face all of those weapons without
[1:18:12] someone at your back
[1:18:14] and you know i feel like this entire
[1:18:17] church has my back this adult the use
[1:18:20] everybody
[1:18:21] so i really appreciate that thank you a
[1:18:23] blessing i'm done now
[1:18:29] i'll just say he did not have a very
[1:18:30] hard time at home with covid he uh was
[1:18:33] able to stay home and get paid so
[1:18:37] great job
[1:18:39] we of course
[1:18:41] coveted your prayers as well and i'm
[1:18:43] sure that's what brought him through but
[1:18:44] we we know that is
[1:18:46] because god always comes through so just
[1:18:48] a few things that i wrote down it won't
[1:18:50] be super long
[1:18:52] um now
[1:18:53] when i was there i've never been the
[1:18:54] type of person that
[1:18:56] usually runs around the church and
[1:18:58] screams and hollers but i don't believe
[1:19:00] that's what needs to happen for
[1:19:01] something to change in your life i
[1:19:03] believe it can happen right in your pew
[1:19:05] you don't have to go up to the front and
[1:19:07] alter calls
[1:19:08] you know those aren't even something
[1:19:10] that are mentioned very often or at all
[1:19:12] in the bible that just doesn't need to
[1:19:13] happen and i'm glad that's the case he
[1:19:15] can talk personally to me wherever i'm
[1:19:17] at
[1:19:18] and so
[1:19:19] one of the main things
[1:19:21] is that i like to push at least for this
[1:19:23] testimony is the friends that i made one
[1:19:26] specifically and talking with other
[1:19:28] christians helps me realize what i can
[1:19:31] improve on myself just because i have
[1:19:33] different perspectives from different
[1:19:35] people and so what i was able to learn
[1:19:37] from my friend his name is gideon gibbs
[1:19:40] just to give him credit
[1:19:41] and so we this isn't even at the camp it
[1:19:44] was after the camp just
[1:19:47] being able to talk about a worship and
[1:19:50] when i'm in camp or in any service i'm
[1:19:53] singing songs
[1:19:54] but i'm also thinking
[1:19:56] am i just singing this song just to sing
[1:19:58] it am i here just because of out of
[1:20:00] habit am i really genuine in this moment
[1:20:03] and sometimes to be very truthful the
[1:20:06] answer is no i'm not
[1:20:08] and i want that to change and that has
[1:20:10] changed i attribute that to god and
[1:20:12] everything that i read on that screen
[1:20:15] i mean it with all my heart and i want
[1:20:18] that to be the case for everybody you're
[1:20:19] not there just to show up and play
[1:20:21] church that's not what we're here for
[1:20:26] another thing was i did go for prayer
[1:20:28] and um with brother diggs
[1:20:31] and so i asked specifically about um i'm
[1:20:34] hopefully going to be going through
[1:20:36] changes in life for the better um
[1:20:39] maybe have a family who knows it's just
[1:20:41] something that happens with age and time
[1:20:43] and so i don't know exactly how to go
[1:20:46] about that it's very hard um being in a
[1:20:49] leadership role and that makes me
[1:20:50] nervous
[1:20:51] and so i want leadership from the lord
[1:20:55] and i went to brother dick and i said
[1:20:56] hey i need some help
[1:20:58] i gotta know where the direction to go
[1:21:00] to and he said ask the lord very
[1:21:03] specific things
[1:21:05] don't leave out any details
[1:21:07] and i said okay i'm gonna do that
[1:21:09] and i've actually experienced some
[1:21:11] success with that in the past
[1:21:13] specifically with my job my job is
[1:21:16] definitely not something that i want to
[1:21:18] keep for a very long time
[1:21:20] but while i'm in it it's a little bit
[1:21:21] stressful and sometimes you have to hit
[1:21:24] your specific numbers to continue it's a
[1:21:27] commission-based job and so you have to
[1:21:29] make sure you're on top of it and that's
[1:21:31] very stressful for me so
[1:21:34] i needed to sell five phones that's more
[1:21:37] than i've ever sold ever in one day
[1:21:40] that's never happened and so the most of
[1:21:42] maybe got was four and i needed five to
[1:21:45] make it through that month
[1:21:46] so i sold three that day just person
[1:21:48] after person after person came in that i
[1:21:50] had ordered phones for previously and
[1:21:53] it's very rare that you're able to
[1:21:55] fulfill a phone that you ordered
[1:21:57] yourself because you move stores all the
[1:21:59] time so that in itself is a miracle i
[1:22:02] was able to help the customers out and
[1:22:04] that way it just helps me
[1:22:07] hit the numbers more
[1:22:08] now even better i'd even have to be um
[1:22:12] at work for two more of those phones to
[1:22:14] come through while i was at camp
[1:22:16] so i was like well that's cool i'm not
[1:22:19] going to complain about selling things
[1:22:20] i'm not even there for
[1:22:22] so i really give the god the glory for
[1:22:24] that and for all the youth for what it's
[1:22:26] worth i'm not full of wisdom and some of
[1:22:30] others of you are but ask very specific
[1:22:33] things and if you believe it with all
[1:22:34] your heart you have the right attitude
[1:22:37] about it the right motivation and
[1:22:39] objective
[1:22:40] he can't say no
[1:22:42] god bless
[1:22:43] [Applause]
[1:22:50] as someone who has been to quite a few
[1:22:52] camps over the years i really love camps
[1:22:54] because that's one of the biggest ways
[1:22:55] for me to make friends because i know
[1:22:57] other people and i'm kind of an
[1:22:58] introvert so they make me meet their
[1:23:00] friends so it's really easy for me that
[1:23:02] way
[1:23:02] um but
[1:23:04] this year going to camp for me camps are
[1:23:06] always kind of like
[1:23:07] an encouragement boost uh because you
[1:23:10] know all the stuff centered around youth
[1:23:11] and youth specific issues and stuff
[1:23:14] um and something you know i've been
[1:23:16] struggling with over the last year is
[1:23:18] just overall joy you know
[1:23:21] grief can take a lot of your joy away
[1:23:22] and
[1:23:24] dealing with all of that it has
[1:23:26] made it harder for me at camps than it
[1:23:28] normally would be and i went to bethel
[1:23:30] tabernacle in july
[1:23:32] june july and that camp helped a lot
[1:23:35] but
[1:23:37] something that can happen at camps is
[1:23:39] camps can get into kind of a pattern of
[1:23:41] not necessarily fake experiences but
[1:23:44] getting caught up in the idea of
[1:23:46] experiences instead of experiencing real
[1:23:48] things with god
[1:23:49] and
[1:23:51] i was really not expecting to go to this
[1:23:53] camp and get as much of an experience as
[1:23:55] i did and seeing just
[1:23:58] so many of my really close friends and
[1:24:01] loved ones get so much more to camp than
[1:24:03] i was expecting and praying for and it
[1:24:06] just it really helped me a lot and just
[1:24:08] gave me encouragement for the next year
[1:24:10] and just i hope it's just as good next
[1:24:11] year as it was this year so yeah
[1:24:14] [Applause]
[1:24:25] okay
[1:24:33] but since you gave me the mic i guess
[1:24:34] i'll go anyway um yeah camp was awesome
[1:24:37] camp was great i think
[1:24:39] i went there
[1:24:41] um
[1:24:42] not really expecting a lot i mean i knew
[1:24:43] it was going to be great but like for me
[1:24:45] personally
[1:24:46] i didn't i wasn't expecting a lot i just
[1:24:48] knew my parents were planning this camp
[1:24:50] so i just went and i got a
[1:24:53] really good experience with camp and
[1:24:55] apparently everyone else
[1:24:56] did and then you could tell the devil
[1:24:59] was defeated at that camp because
[1:25:02] my mom even told me you know when
[1:25:04] the battle is almost over and the losing
[1:25:06] side's about to lose they're going to
[1:25:07] throw everything they got at you they're
[1:25:09] going to throw their last ditch effort
[1:25:11] and you can tell at camp he knew he was
[1:25:13] defeated and after camp he threw
[1:25:16] everything he had left at everyone and
[1:25:18] you could tell that that's the biggest
[1:25:20] testimony it shows that he knows he was
[1:25:22] defeated
[1:25:23] because he was
[1:25:24] man he sure gave everything he had the
[1:25:26] last two days
[1:25:27] like but it was great yeah everyone had
[1:25:29] a great time i can't wait to go back
[1:25:31] next year
[1:25:32] and uh yeah
[1:25:41] okay so i'm going to start out by
[1:25:43] thanking everyone who made the camp
[1:25:45] possible
[1:25:46] um all of the people who helped out all
[1:25:49] of the counselors especially
[1:25:51] um
[1:25:52] i
[1:25:53] formed a special
[1:25:57] i formed a special bond with my
[1:25:58] counselor actually and he sent me a
[1:26:00] message after camp
[1:26:02] um and i'd like to just read that
[1:26:04] message because it was really special to
[1:26:05] me and it uh really helped me for
[1:26:08] exactly what i needed so
[1:26:10] let me get this
[1:26:19] okay so he said i really wanted you all
[1:26:21] to see
[1:26:22] that you don't have to stop being you to
[1:26:24] serve the lord being young is a gift and
[1:26:27] sometimes as adults we suck all the fun
[1:26:29] out of christianity and it can drive our
[1:26:31] young people away
[1:26:33] use that gift
[1:26:34] of youth to build the lord's kingdom and
[1:26:36] his people and use him for what you
[1:26:40] and use what you are on
[1:26:42] what
[1:26:44] what you love for him it was nice
[1:26:46] meeting you as well
[1:26:47] so that was really special to me and it
[1:26:50] was exactly what i needed to hear so i
[1:26:51] just wanted to
[1:26:53] say that also
[1:26:54] she's going to kill me for this but
[1:26:56] amariah's special was probably the best
[1:26:58] special i may be
[1:27:00] i may be a little biased here but it's
[1:27:02] definitely the best best special she's
[1:27:04] ever given and it's definitely the best
[1:27:06] special i think i've ever heard so you
[1:27:08] should go
[1:27:09] uh listen to that for sure
[1:27:12] [Applause]
[1:27:19] uh
[1:27:23] not good at talking in front of people
[1:27:24] like this
[1:27:25] but um
[1:27:27] yeah our dorm leader um he's actually
[1:27:29] was my cousin peter hall
[1:27:31] and i agree with you ryan like he has a
[1:27:33] lot of wisdom and he's young it's not
[1:27:35] something you expect with someone his
[1:27:37] age
[1:27:38] but um he really made our dorm like
[1:27:40] all of us had a connection like
[1:27:43] it was like i've known them for years
[1:27:45] don't ask me names
[1:27:46] not that i don't know them that well but
[1:27:50] the whole camp was just a real it was
[1:27:51] really nice it was like it was really
[1:27:53] beautiful
[1:27:54] it was
[1:27:55] everything was kind of easy access but i
[1:27:57] was on crutches i'm like it was kind of
[1:28:01] easy
[1:28:03] but i just i do want to thank everyone
[1:28:05] that made it possible and deb and travis
[1:28:07] you really are like our mom so
[1:28:09] thanks mom thanks dad
[1:28:13] [Applause]

[1:33:51] amazing i'm here to tell you we had so
[1:33:53] many people saying people with
[1:33:55] experience people who knew what they
[1:33:56] were talking about
[1:33:57] that
[1:33:58] it was as if our team

[1:34:55] demars
[1:34:56] i so appreciate what these brothers were
[1:34:58] able to accomplish i appreciate you know
[1:35:02] we had a testimony they might give it
[1:35:04] but jason might give it he gave it to me
[1:35:06] about how that sister amy was his saving
[1:35:09] grace because she remembered so much
[1:35:11] that covet had devastated his memory and
[1:35:14] mine and preparations over
[1:35:16] and i'm so happy to have brother jason
[1:35:18] still here and the devil tried hard to
[1:35:22] take him hard i mean hard and we were
[1:35:25] praying so earnestly around the world
[1:35:28] brother jd they are praying for you on
[1:35:30] every continent where the message
[1:35:31] believers are
[1:35:33] and thousands and thousands of people
[1:35:35] and for brother mark who the enemy um
[1:35:38] actually did take him out two or three
[1:35:40] times in those like i said in the last
[1:35:42] testimony service the lord just kept
[1:35:43] giving him back
[1:35:44] amen and there was there was others
[1:35:47] uh who were very sick
[1:35:49] and uh very very and suffered greatly
[1:35:52] but were happy for the lord who
[1:35:54] intervened amen we had sister kathy
[1:35:57] testifying brother jack here uh the
[1:35:59] other week and so i'm just glad for what
[1:36:02] god did but i'm i'm particularly
[1:36:04] thankful
[1:36:05] for brother matt and brother jason
[1:36:07] because um you know these two brothers
[1:36:10] really shouldered the lion's share
[1:36:13] and uh i i i'm so glad and i i know that
[1:36:17] some of them stream this service and
[1:36:19] matt asked me to be careful but
[1:36:22] i'm just so happy that brother matt is
[1:36:24] still with us
[1:36:25] amen and i know that there would be many
[1:36:27] other churches
[1:36:28] not just western but there'd be many
[1:36:31] churches who would like to have brother
[1:36:33] matt but he felt led that the lord had
[1:36:35] him here amen his place was with you and
[1:36:38] me amen and i just couldn't be more
[1:36:41] proud of him for the job he did and i
[1:36:44] know that
[1:36:46] i know that a lot and i don't even know
[1:36:48] all that went into it but i know it was
[1:36:50] a lot it was one of the easiest things i
[1:36:52] ever pulled off because i had to do
[1:36:54] almost nothing
[1:36:56] and and rachel tirelessly rachel is just
[1:37:00] incredible
[1:37:01] and uh i just appreciate her so much
[1:37:04] and brother jason and sister amy um uh
[1:37:07] coming alongside brother matt and sister
[1:37:10] rachel to say yep we'll share in that
[1:37:12] vision we want to do it as well
[1:37:14] and so brother jd why don't you come on
[1:37:16] up you and sister amy and uh say
[1:37:18] something for the lord here
[1:37:21] yes sir
[1:37:24] amen
[1:37:25] thankful to be here
[1:37:27] i think
[1:37:28] it's not about it's not about us
[1:37:31] it's about what the lord is doing
[1:37:33] and it was about
[1:37:34] seeing god work in the hearts of the
[1:37:35] young people
[1:37:37] that's all we wanted to see
[1:37:39] and
[1:37:40] whatever effort it took to put into it
[1:37:42] it's a small thing
[1:37:44] just to see
[1:37:45] some of the testimonies
[1:37:48] we sent out a survey some of you
[1:37:50] probably seen it if you haven't filled
[1:37:51] it out fill it out
[1:37:53] we've gotten
[1:37:55] so far 119 answers
[1:37:57] and a hundred percent said
[1:38:00] overall they had a positive experience
[1:38:03] at the camp so
[1:38:04] we're so grateful for that that's what
[1:38:06] we that's what we work so hard for and
[1:38:08] that's the effort that we put in
[1:38:11] is that god would move in their lives
[1:38:12] there was a lot of testimonies
[1:38:14] that came back
[1:38:16] i'm gonna go in and just
[1:38:19] read a couple of them
[1:38:22] one young man says i've been dealing
[1:38:24] with
[1:38:25] anger issues my whole life
[1:38:28] and when i when i was at camp i decided
[1:38:30] to give my life to god
[1:38:31] and i've been feeling calm and collected
[1:38:34] and all my anger is gone
[1:38:37] and then
[1:38:39] another person writes in and um
[1:38:42] says every time before i had an
[1:38:44] experience
[1:38:46] quote unquote experience it's been
[1:38:48] emotional
[1:38:49] and has lasted for two days i struggled
[1:38:51] a lot with depression
[1:38:53] and struggling with my identity
[1:38:56] well i knew that god wouldn't
[1:38:59] appreciate that sort of thing there was
[1:39:00] something inside me pulling me towards
[1:39:02] that sort of life
[1:39:03] was a constant battle that pulled me
[1:39:05] both directions and lately i had been
[1:39:07] feeling it was pulling me the wrong way
[1:39:09] on thursday i believe i received the
[1:39:11] holy ghost but i couldn't be sure it was
[1:39:14] what it was
[1:39:15] so many times before i'd been given
[1:39:16] false hope on friday night i was given a
[1:39:18] confirmation that this was real
[1:39:20] now that i'm back home i'm having more
[1:39:22] determined
[1:39:23] having more determination to resist amen
[1:39:27] with god's help i know that i can resist
[1:39:29] temptation and thoughts that come to me
[1:39:31] i know that i'm safe in him i want to
[1:39:33] thank the preachers counselors and the
[1:39:36] many other people who made this camp
[1:39:37] possible mostly i'd like to thank god
[1:39:39] without this camp i might not have made
[1:39:41] it this far and
[1:39:42] might now still be lost again you all
[1:39:45] have my gratitude and to god be the
[1:39:47] glory
[1:39:51] there's another one here that i want to
[1:39:52] make sure
[1:39:54] that i get to
[1:39:59] yeah
[1:40:00] i came to camp this is from
[1:40:02] i can say the name on this one because i
[1:40:04] got permission from his parents is from
[1:40:06] micah curtis stephen emily curtis's
[1:40:09] son
[1:40:10] i came to camp not praying for
[1:40:12] deliverance but praying for god to put
[1:40:13] the next few steps in my life for his
[1:40:15] perfect will
[1:40:16] i had applied for an amazing job in a
[1:40:18] very competitive field i prayed and just
[1:40:20] left it in god's hands and the day after
[1:40:22] i got home from camp i was leaving my
[1:40:24] current job and got a call back for an
[1:40:26] interview praising the lord for even the
[1:40:28] opportunity to interview if god's
[1:40:30] god wills me to have this job that's
[1:40:32] amazing but even if i don't get it i'll
[1:40:33] still praise him
[1:40:38] let me see
[1:40:42] i was struggling with knowing if i had
[1:40:43] the holy ghost but during the second
[1:40:44] service i reached a level of faith to
[1:40:46] where i believe i have it now
[1:40:49] another person says i was i was super
[1:40:51] bitter about my grandfather's death
[1:40:54] um
[1:40:56] and i was delivered
[1:40:58] i'm so happy
[1:41:00] um
[1:41:02] and there's another one that i'm just
[1:41:04] missing here
[1:41:06] okay thank you
[1:41:12] thank you
[1:41:17] uh yes
[1:41:19] a
[1:41:20] person says i received the holy ghost
[1:41:22] saturday night
[1:41:24] after almost leaving the message six
[1:41:26] months earlier
[1:41:27] so
[1:41:29] the testimonies are continuing to come
[1:41:31] in it's only about
[1:41:32] not even half the campers that have
[1:41:34] responded so far so we'll we'll we'll
[1:41:37] make a place for people to be able to
[1:41:39] see some of the different testimonies
[1:41:41] come in anonymously
[1:41:43] but this that's this is why this is why
[1:41:46] we did this
[1:41:48] amen and we're so and i'm just so
[1:41:49] thankful and it's to me that's the
[1:41:51] reward right there
[1:41:53] amen brother matt
[1:41:55] did you have anything wrong
[1:41:58] with
[1:41:59] actually it's not a testimony but i just
[1:42:01] wanted to
[1:42:02] um to all of the the group from our
[1:42:04] church that was there um there was a
[1:42:07] large group of people that were helping
[1:42:08] me keep an eye on this guy right here
[1:42:10] and whether that would be
[1:42:12] taking him back up to the camper
[1:42:14] bringing him meals giving him rides what
[1:42:15] not i just want to thank you all so much
[1:42:17] for
[1:42:17] taking care of him and helping
[1:42:20] and given the circumstances around it
[1:42:22] and what leading up to it when i look
[1:42:24] back at how
[1:42:26] how it went that it was so amazing
[1:42:29] and
[1:42:30] what what we pulled off
[1:42:32] the only explanation is god so just want
[1:42:34] to give him the glory
[1:42:48] all right how much
[1:42:50] how much time we got left
[1:42:56] boy there's so much we don't want to
[1:42:58] miss out it's got so much i want to say
[1:43:01] and some will be just a little repeated
[1:43:03] that was um
[1:43:04] maybe you already heard and not
[1:43:06] everyone's here first thing i'll say is
[1:43:08] not everyone's here not nearly everyone
[1:43:10] i know there's a lot streaming online i
[1:43:12] looked earlier a lot streaming to see
[1:43:14] this so
[1:43:16] uh some of these things i just wrote for
[1:43:18] my own personal notes
[1:43:19] first i would just like to say and i
[1:43:21] know it's been emphasized that
[1:43:24] you have no idea and there's no way i
[1:43:25] could have the time to express out of
[1:43:27] everyone who put
[1:43:29] so much into the planning stages i know
[1:43:32] it was said that we pulled off something
[1:43:33] that was done in weeks we this has been
[1:43:35] we had months
[1:43:37] how many months
[1:43:39] the day even before our youth camp
[1:43:41] meetings that we had here we were
[1:43:43] already planning and directly after that
[1:43:46] went right into further planning
[1:43:48] for youth camp
[1:43:50] we had
[1:43:51] a dozen or more uh i don't know how many
[1:43:54] uh meetings just hours and hours and
[1:43:58] hours and hours till late hours of the
[1:44:00] night uh hours of in the planning stages
[1:44:03] and just praying over some of the core
[1:44:06] issues of the camp and what we wanted
[1:44:08] and so there was so much spent so much
[1:44:11] time i can't even begin to tell you how
[1:44:13] many hours
[1:44:14] went into um
[1:44:16] just making sure everything was was what
[1:44:19] it was and brother jason and sister amy
[1:44:22] i don't even know i have no words to put
[1:44:24] into
[1:44:25] um and i'm not trying to flatter them
[1:44:27] but the
[1:44:28] the gift that god has placed in their
[1:44:30] life both of them um in some ways it's
[1:44:33] very similar with logistics and i don't
[1:44:36] even i don't want to start labeling it
[1:44:37] because
[1:44:38] there was there was so much that that
[1:44:41] brother jason and sister amy had the
[1:44:43] work that they had put in and i mean
[1:44:45] elbow grease just hard work and hours of
[1:44:49] mental labor and data sheets and putting
[1:44:51] together and double checking and triple
[1:44:52] checking and quadruple a checklist if we
[1:44:54] didn't have brother jason and sister amy
[1:44:57] it wouldn't have been what it was and i
[1:44:58] really mean that and to watch how the
[1:45:01] devil tried to just take them and remove
[1:45:04] them from even getting to go to camp
[1:45:06] i just want to thank the lord for the
[1:45:08] victory of the fact that brother jason
[1:45:10] and sister amy got to go so once you
[1:45:12] give the lord a hand clapping praise for
[1:45:14] that
[1:45:16] and i can tell you that
[1:45:18] i can tell you that i know brother jason
[1:45:20] and a lot who didn't know and sister amy
[1:45:23] both
[1:45:24] through the
[1:45:25] the
[1:45:26] turbulent and the turbulence they went
[1:45:29] to leading up to camp they didn't go
[1:45:31] refreshing like some of us who maybe
[1:45:33] were more refreshed
[1:45:35] they had every right to go to a cabin in
[1:45:37] gatlinburg for a month
[1:45:39] after what they had went through and
[1:45:41] most everyone else would have just
[1:45:43] stayed home the only reason they went is
[1:45:46] because of a burden and a desire for the
[1:45:49] young people that's the only reason
[1:45:51] and so to see them labor they already
[1:45:53] went there i remember after just a few
[1:45:55] days someone asked me and said brother
[1:45:57] matt you know the uh he said something
[1:45:59] and and i think his brother burley i was
[1:46:01] supposed to text deborah his number so
[1:46:03] they could they could speak about it
[1:46:04] that's the skit and brother said brother
[1:46:06] matt you're tell sister jeff i said oh i
[1:46:08] forgot he said i knew you would i said
[1:46:09] brother burleigh you ever ate mashed
[1:46:10] potatoes he said yeah i said that's what
[1:46:12] my brain feels like right now
[1:46:15] and i can't imagine because there they
[1:46:17] went there with their brains already
[1:46:18] mashed potatoes and so uh i just want to
[1:46:21] commend them so many more to come in but
[1:46:24] just want to commend them because of the
[1:46:26] hardship that they went through jason
[1:46:27] when brother jason wasn't recovered
[1:46:29] still not 100 percent lord's given him
[1:46:31] his strength back
[1:46:33] but he just went and he stayed as much
[1:46:35] as he could and he was there as much as
[1:46:37] he could so so much work he put into it
[1:46:39] and i'm just glad he was able to go
[1:46:41] there and be part of it sister amy as
[1:46:42] well brother tony who's not even here
[1:46:45] tonight i wish he was here to stand
[1:46:47] because brother tony was such an
[1:46:48] essential part of everything sister

[1:46:55] just wanted to to say thank you
[1:46:57] in so many categories not just us and
[1:47:00] them i would never want to portray that
[1:47:01] but the entire group of leadership that
[1:47:04] we just that was especially the ones
[1:47:06] part in the planning stage it puts so
[1:47:08] much work and time and effort
[1:47:10] into that

[1:51:03] wouldn't have a camp choir and i know
[1:51:04] sister ruth doesn't want to hear that
[1:51:06] but that's what she told me so she was
[1:51:08] wonderful uh with the music and and also
[1:51:11] the medical team there all right so that
[1:51:14] is just some of the names i wanted to
[1:51:16] make sure
[1:51:17] uh i didn't get camp filled up fast foot
[1:51:20] up in seven days when we put out the
[1:51:21] registration we were full and within i
[1:51:24] think just a few days our waiting list
[1:51:27] was over 50 and we had and at that point
[1:51:30] we didn't know if we were going to get
[1:51:31] any in and by the grace of god we were
[1:51:33] able to get all of them in
[1:51:36] so we had 50 cancellations and 50
[1:51:38] roughly 50 replacements um and i want to
[1:51:41] say deborah sister deborah mentioned
[1:51:43] started mentioning some names so some of
[1:51:45] the names we mentioned you do a thanks
[1:51:47] service like this to give gratitude
[1:51:49] and they were people that
[1:51:52] all of us interacted with and were
[1:51:54] special to and important to that i would
[1:51:56] have never known i didn't know i know
[1:51:58] seeing brother doug's chastity but
[1:51:59] because i wasn't in that part i didn't
[1:52:01] see some debra mentioned them and
[1:52:03] different ones didn't get mentioned
[1:52:04] because they weren't in any direct
[1:52:06] interaction with them but there were for
[1:52:09] me so this is just me and i'm just gonna
[1:52:11] say this there were two people who
[1:52:13] didn't um wasn't expecting me to say
[1:52:15] this here tonight didn't tell them i was
[1:52:17] going to that were i have and i really
[1:52:20] mean this i have no other words to say
[1:52:22] than angels
[1:52:23] sent from god
[1:52:25] to me personally and that's brother
[1:52:27] george buckman and brother mike gonzalez
[1:52:29] will you stand up brother mike and
[1:52:31] brother george
[1:52:32] i don't know you have
[1:52:37] i have no words i really don't and i
[1:52:40] don't i don't mean to make them bigger
[1:52:42] than any other part because everyone
[1:52:43] played such an important part but i'm
[1:52:44] just giving you from my experience
[1:52:46] you don't realize how essential that had
[1:52:49] those two brothers not shown up and been
[1:52:51] faithful there and diligent and and i
[1:52:54] tell you what when brother michael and
[1:52:55] brother george you tell them and give
[1:52:57] them a task to do something they they
[1:52:59] give it a hundred thousand percent
[1:53:02] and they gave that every service today
[1:53:05] uh every service that we had they were
[1:53:07] there for hours and spent labor and time
[1:53:10] and were dedicated
[1:53:12] on time and while my brains was mashed
[1:53:14] potatoes um i had some good help because
[1:53:18] i couldn't have done it without them
[1:53:20] so i just want to give a special thanks
[1:53:22] to those two brothers brother jeremy
[1:53:24] clavel who doesn't even go to this
[1:53:25] church was also essential on that team
[1:53:28] goes to brother berry coffees but just
[1:53:30] the hours i mean i i don't know it we we
[1:53:33] spent i didn't want to guess how many
[1:53:35] hours we were there one night till 1 a.m
[1:53:37] and those brothers were just speaking a
[1:53:39] language that i didn't understand they
[1:53:41] were talking about networking and man it
[1:53:42] was like french i know a lot about
[1:53:44] computers but that was in a whole nother
[1:53:46] league
[1:53:47] and had we not had them i just uh i just
[1:53:50] can't say enough about that sister wanda
[1:53:53] and a lot of people don't realize the
[1:53:55] role sister wanda played when we asked
[1:53:57] sister wander brother mike to help with
[1:53:59] the shuttle take over the shuttling
[1:54:01] service and that was essential how many

[2:06:58] chapel there's others i'm gonna give
[2:07:00] just rachel just a second to say
[2:07:01] something
[2:07:03] i'm not like mad i'm not good at talking
[2:07:05] in front of people but
[2:07:06] if i was gonna say something it would be
[2:07:08] that i noticed that everybody that had a
[2:07:11] part in helping
[2:07:12] gave
[2:07:13] 200 percent they wore 50 different hats
[2:07:16] it wasn't ever one person having one job
[2:07:19] it was
[2:07:20] every single person did the job of 50
[2:07:23] and it was everybody who helped and that
[2:07:25] that's what made the camp work the way
[2:07:27] that it did but
[2:07:29] two people that i would say just well
[2:07:31] maybe three people
[2:07:33] deb
[2:07:34] she's humble so she's she's gonna
[2:07:36] pretend like it was nothing but she
[2:07:38] literally stayed in that chapel and
[2:07:40] played music the entire time i hardly
[2:07:43] saw her at all we all really didn't see
[2:07:46] her she played the piano and required
[2:07:49] practice for specials for specials for
[2:07:51] church
[2:07:56] hours and hours and hours and then on
[2:07:58] top of that she was a counselor and she
[2:08:00] was running back and forth and everybody
[2:08:02] who was there knows that it was no short
[2:08:04] distance to that chapel she ran back and
[2:08:07] forth the whole time
[2:08:08] and
[2:08:09] with a joyful spirit more than anything
[2:08:12] the whole time anytime you try to
[2:08:13] compliment her say deb
[2:08:15] you're doing so much she'd be like oh no
[2:08:18] it was nothing i the lord did it for me
[2:08:20] because i i was so and then another one
[2:08:23] was amy
[2:08:24] we can all agree that when we were in
[2:08:26] there amy was like the brain
[2:08:29] of the entire thing
[2:08:31] and she was so tired
[2:08:33] but every time we had a question we knew
[2:08:36] that amy would have the answer so we
[2:08:38] started just asking her everything even
[2:08:40] things that other people would know it
[2:08:42] was like amy amy and she was just like
[2:08:45] pumping out the answers and she was just
[2:08:48] she was our fearless leader i think all
[2:08:50] of us would say that so that really
[2:08:52] appreciate that and another one i really
[2:08:53] want to say she's not here
[2:08:55] is abby
[2:08:56] abby stayed in that
[2:08:58] that um
[2:09:00] registration room whatever you call it
[2:09:02] the entire time with us she the t-shirts
[2:09:05] i was in charge of handing out the
[2:09:06] t-shirts would have been an absolute
[2:09:08] disaster if abby would not i mean the
[2:09:10] lord knew i kept telling every i got it
[2:09:12] i got it i can do it it's not going to
[2:09:14] be that hard i got a system the lord
[2:09:16] knew that if abby smith would not have
[2:09:18] walked in when she did and she just
[2:09:20] stood up beside me said i'm going to
[2:09:21] help you
[2:09:22] it would have been a disaster it would
[2:09:23] have been utter chaos and she was there
[2:09:26] the whole time she helped us with really
[2:09:27] everything the concessions everything
[2:09:29] and she's
[2:09:30] i consider her a young person
[2:09:32] she should have been out there with
[2:09:34] everybody enjoying it but she the whole
[2:09:35] time
[2:09:37] the whole time she was in there helping
[2:09:39] i think with everything so make sure she
[2:09:41] goes back and watches this so that she
[2:09:43] knows i said that about her um but so
[2:09:46] many helped i think so many i just can't
[2:09:48] even say but those are the the ones that
[2:09:49] come to my mind that i wanted to say
[2:09:51] yeah there was so so so many um names
[2:09:55] that i'm just going through my list here
[2:09:56] of people that um uh were helped in such
[2:09:59] a way sister chastity's here and brother
[2:10:01] doug's out of town and i can't tell you
[2:10:04] and i wasn't even there for most of it
[2:10:05] but i watched as sister chastity was
[2:10:08] just working working working brother
[2:10:10] doug working working working brother
[2:10:11] doug took three trips to costco
[2:10:14] three in a day i can't imagine going to
[2:10:17] costco one time
[2:10:19] man he went three times
[2:10:22] and was just tirelessly tirelessly
[2:10:25] working just constantly whatever he
[2:10:27] could do he was in charge of the mass
[2:10:28] texting app that we had one more thing i
[2:10:31] want to say i forgot the skit deb wrote
[2:10:33] that skit and it was unbelievable and it
[2:10:36] was inspired i can tell you that much
[2:10:38] she put a lot of time into it and
[2:10:40] chastity helped and um but the young
[2:10:42] people our young people got out there
[2:10:45] that's not easy being a teenager and
[2:10:47] getting up in front of 300 kids
[2:10:50] and doing any sort of acting i would not
[2:10:52] have done it and they did it and they
[2:10:54] pulled through they did such a good job
[2:10:56] they all knew their lines they probably
[2:10:58] it took time away from the swing to even
[2:11:00] go into the skip practice i think
[2:11:03] but they did it and it was such a hit
[2:11:06] amongst everybody at the camp and that i
[2:11:09] admire that that to me i'm so thankful
[2:11:11] that they even said that they would do
[2:11:12] that yeah
[2:11:13] yeah we had so many i just want to make
[2:11:15] sure we don't miss any but so many just
[2:11:17] said what can we do
[2:11:19] what can we do to help brother doug
[2:11:20] sister chastity got there
[2:11:22] thursday night and we're up with brother
[2:11:24] brad sister sarah jason amy me rachel

[2:15:49] try to improve it for the next year so
[2:15:51] we're going to have some brainstorming
[2:15:53] on all of that i just want to you know
[2:15:55] for me
[2:15:57] it was
[2:15:58] it's hard to describe how comforting it
[2:16:00] is
[2:16:01] to know that you have
[2:16:03] qualified good dependable people
[2:16:06] in the positions where
[2:16:08] you know it's like like these military
[2:16:10] pilots that fly these jets and they have
[2:16:12] a weapons called fire and forget
[2:16:15] and they just they aim it they lock it
[2:16:17] on they fire it and they go on to
[2:16:18] another target they know that missile
[2:16:20] will go do its job
[2:16:21] and there were so many moments that i
[2:16:24] had a pause to go oh wonder if this oh
[2:16:27] what about that and i thought wait a
[2:16:28] minute i got people yeah okay they got
[2:16:30] oh yeah there's brother sister so-and-so
[2:16:32] brother sister so i got it yeah and and
[2:16:35] every time that happened to me
[2:16:37] i was so aware
[2:16:39] that who i had
[2:16:42] handling that would handle it better
[2:16:44] than me
[2:16:45] and and it was just remarkable i
[2:16:47] appreciated
[2:16:49] uh having my son at the head of all of
[2:16:51] that it was comforting to know that i
[2:16:53] had one person that i could just say hey
[2:16:56] matt what about this what about that and
[2:16:57] if he didn't know the answer he had
[2:16:58] people that could get him the answer
[2:17:00] and so it just but every department head
[2:17:03] every worker everybody that was involved
