[0:24] We have stepped into
[0:29] eternal
[0:31] etity. We have stepped into
[0:38] eternity. But we have stepped into
[0:46] eternity. We have passed from
[0:50] death unto
[0:53] life. You believe that? We are the

[0:58] resurrection. We are the
[1:02] life. We have stepped
[1:05] into oh
[1:09] eternity. Bright. We have stepped into

[2:06] Christ is the
[2:09] mystery of God
[2:11] revealed and he has opened up our
[2:16] hearts to the seven
[2:19] seal and we have failed
[2:24] into all eternity.

[2:29] There's a message in the
[2:32] land. Oh, the world can't
[2:36] understand. Don't you know that mighty
[2:38] angel
[2:40] came and called out my name? My little
[2:45] cow for has been fulfilled. You believe
[2:48] it? Oh, the bride of Christ is sealed.

[3:11] [Music]
[3:16] eternity. My
[3:19] offer is waiting for me.
[3:24] We're going to live in our glorified
[3:27] body for all
[3:30] eternity. We are walking in the
[3:35] light of the spoken word. Hallelujah.
[3:40] This is the greatest
[3:43] revelation that I ever heard.
[3:47] Oh, we have fell

[4:22] come. Christ in the blood are one. We
