that and we thank the lord for that it's nice to have home folks when you go out on the road it was a pleasure this past sunday to be in service with you you know as a minister your family hears you preach all the time so when you go off they're like oh you got to preach so they really enjoyed it was a treat to hear brother jason on sunday so thank you for allowing us to be a part of your service we know that space is limited but we're here how many of you are here tonight to have church no no no no that's a week amen i said how many of you are here tonight to have church i understand coven 19's got everything messed up but we're still sons and daughters of god we can worship with your mask on you can still worship god tonight because he's worthy to be praised i'm here to tell you god is doing great things among his people and if i can get you to believe tonight you're going to see the miraculous if i can get you to believe tonight that the word is not only for the 50s and 60s but it's for you here tonight you're going to see the hand of god sweep down in bethel tabernacle and see the movement of the spirit because he said where two or three will be gathered in my name i'll be there and i believe church tonight he's here he's in this house he's in this house what used to be dead he's no longer dead but it's been made alive by the spirit of god and i believe he's here tonight to minister to your need to minister to your need and to your need he's still god do you believe tonight can we believe can we have church tonight and say god come by my way tonight as you're moving through the pews come by my pew speak to me tonight move on my situation tonight oh i just believe at church let us just pray father oh god how we ask that you just come by our way tonight lord come by in the supernatural lord lord so many want to put the supernatural on the shelf and say we don't need it today they want to put the miraculous back in the 50s and 60s and just say it was all for a profit but god i believe you're the same today i believe when you wrote it in the word that i'm jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever i believe you're just as much christ tonight as you were back there two thousand years ago when you spit on the ground and created eyeballs for a blind man i believe you're still the miraculous god tonight and i'm asking father you'll anoint these lips to speak only words of life and you anoint the ears of the hero tonight to receive it father god may you bless this service lord bless this little tabernacle has been set aside to proclaim liberty to proclaim freedom to proclaim the supernatural to proclaim the miraculous lord we're not putting you in a as a god of yesterday a god of history we're calling you out of history tonight and say god perform the same signs the same wonders the same works that jesus did may it be performed tonight in this church father we believe lord god therefore we speak life tonight and we speak as an oracle as an instrument lord and may you use your instrument tonight as i'll do my part to get out of the way lord you do your part to expound the word to us we ask for us in jesus name amen if you have your bibles tonight we're going to look here in luke 1 verse 26. luke 1 and verse 26 four weeks ago to this day i preached a message back home on god does impossible math and when we think about math we think about problems we think about equations we think about you know for some of us very difficult computations to try to get to the answer but god does impossible math he loves to deal with impossible situations impossible problems because there's never been a problem that god didn't have but the answer and i believe tonight he's still god and what i want to speak to you tonight just for a little bit i'm not sure how long you have service but we're here so let's just have church tonight but i want to speak to you god wants you to believe for the impossible god wants you to believe for the impossible whatever you're facing whatever situation you're going through god wants you to believe that he has the answer and not only does he have the answer but you can have the answer tonight because he is god and the prophet of god said god is god and that's all we need tonight just as you mentioned the other sunday he's still christ everything we are is christ whether we go to walmart it's christ i'm going to tell you he's god of the bible or he ain't got it all he's got tonight or he ain't got it all but i'm here to tell you and proclaim to you he's still god god is god and god is ready to have church and i trust you are luke 1 verse 26 and in the sixth month if you can get just a little bit of the treble out of this that'll be great or add me some bass because it's piercing my ear in the sixth month the angel graber was sent from god into a city of galilee named nazareth to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was joseph of the house of david and the virgin's name was mary and the angel came into her and he said hell thou art highly favored the lord is with thee blessed art thou among women and when she saw him she was troubled at his saying and she cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be and the angel said unto her fear not mary for thou hast found favor with god and behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and thou shall call his name jesus and he shall be great and he shall be called the son of the highest and the lord god shall give unto him the throne of his father david and he shall reign over the house of jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end then said mary unto the angel how shall this be seeing i know not a man and the angel answered and said unto her the holy ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the high shall overshadow thee therefore also that the holy thing we shall be born of thee shall be called the son of god and verse 37 for with god nothing shall be impossible and notice mary's reply behold the handmaid of the lord be it unto me according to thy word and the angel departed from her you can have your seats tonight so we find here tonight the word impossible means not possible now isn't that profound that's very profound webster put that in there impossible means not possible unable to be or to exist unable to be done unable to be performed unable to be true utterly impractical hopelessly unsuitable so we find here that it's impossible no possibility 100 not able to be done and many times that's the situations that we face in our life it may be with health it may be with some situation some torment in spirit or it may be with finance or whatever it may be many if at some point through our christian journey has faced or is facing or will face an impossible situation but i want you to know like god wants you to believe for the impossible god doesn't want that to hinder your faith god doesn't want that to stop you from moving forward and we find how many you've ever laid up at night sweating tossing and turning wringing your hands because you got a situation and you don't have the answer you don't have the clue how you're going to get through this how is god going to make a way for you but look many times that's when you got to take your eyes off of your problem take your eyes off of the situation and put your eyes back on god back on the word of god and when you take your eyes off of you take your eyes and put them back on god then all things are possible now in louisiana all means everything not sure what it means here in south carolina but i'm assuming it means the same and for a believer it means no matter what i face it matters no matter what devil i face what situation i face one problem i face all things are possible for them that believe tonight so we're going to take this story of mary we're going to drop in here we're going to dramatize i love how the prophet of god will just kind of drop in and tell a story as if he just was back there and he watched it play out and he said in the spring sun was rising high and the judean seas are in the skies and it started up the street mary started up the street going to get her water that morning her little youthful mind was thinking about the day before when she was in church and hearing the rabbi speak and oh how he was telling them how god had done great things and miraculous things hey talked about how they brought them through the red sea we know when they were trapped there and you know it seemed to be an impossible situation brother jason but that didn't stop god god put a highway right through the red sea and he began to tell him about how david when david faced goliath there he was a little bitty young man but he didn't let the goliath's boats put any fear inside of it looked to be an impossible situation but david had been anointed to be king in the impossible situation was made a reality because david took god and his word oh he you know he would tell him about daniel and the lion's den in the hebrew children how they faced a fiery furnace all impossible situations he was lifting their faith up for the prophet god was saved but by the end of the message he ruined what he had been talking about when he said those great days of jehovah dealing with the people like that it wasn't necessary no more those great days of jehovah moving through the red sea and the prophet of god would say god look down through angry eyes any part of the red sea i say god come tonight and look through angry eyes and look at the situation it may be nervousness it may be high blood pressure it may be depressing god look down tonight and apart the red sea for us and we can walk on through to dry ground but he said he ruined it because he said that to jehovah of the old he doesn't deal with the people like that anymore god doesn't do those things anymore it's not necessary we don't need god to do that see they become brother brother men will say they have to come settle down in their homeland and they didn't exactly need miracles no more oh i don't know if you've heard some of the trends sweeping through the message ranks well the days of miracles are passed that was only for the 50s and 60s that was only for a prophet ministry oh don't you put the god don't put god in the past church if he's not god today he wasn't god then but i'm going to tell you as much as god as he was in the 50s and 60s in the supernatural he's still god for you tonight whatever your situation whatever the circumstance you're going through he's still god don't you let somebody proclaim we don't need the god of wonders we don't need the god of miraculous we don't need the god of supernatural yes we need him tonight i need him tonight you need him tonight he needs to show up in this service tonight do you welcome that god tonight do you welcome into your pew it's one thing to welcome into the church but do you welcome into your pew do you welcome into your situation do you welcome into your private life god i'm dealing with this i need you to move tonight i need to see the god of the supernatural brother god would go on to say they had good doctors for their sickness which is certainly all right they had better they were better off they had they had their homes but they didn't need god in the god of miracles anymore and somehow that didn't settle that didn't satisf excuse me satisfy the thirst and hunger of joseph and mary and i trust it doesn't satisfy the thirst of bethel tabernacle tonight oh i can't listen to that i can't hear that something that just doesn't sit well with me when they say we don't need that kind of god anymore because they don't want to be associated with holy roller worship you know you can look at me and you may think well he come out of a pentecostal church no not so i came off the streets 22 years ago come off the streets came in and began to serve god god began to deal with me in a baptist church then i went to this church and i went to that church and finally i came into the truth let me tell you i ain't never been the same since you can label me what you want but he's already called me a son of god and what the spirit of the lord is there is liberty there is freedom to worship that's the sing the great songs of jehovah god moving in the red seas moving upon the people and i believe he's just as much god tonight so mary's walking down the road now and she's thinking about yesterday's service man this just didn't settle well with me how can it be that he done all these things and we hear about the god of our grandfather the god of our fathers and the god of our grandfather why isn't he god today we've heard about the god of brother branham and that generation and how that generation passed on and you can go to some churches and they still there's some of them there that that remember those days in the 60s late 60s and they were part of the the the services of brother branham that he had they've witnessed the supernatural why can't we see that same kind of movement today why can't we expect god to do the same today is it because the man's off the scene so does our entire experience rest on a man or does it rest on god oh does it rest because if it rests on a man then what happened in the first age when paul left the scene and iranians left the scene and luther left the scene and colombo left the scene what happens church god doesn't cease to be god he's still god tonight and he's still wanting his people to believe in the impossibilities oh hallelujah so she's walking down the street thinking on these things and she sees a little glimmer of light you know look kind of like us we could just kind of rub our eyes you know early morning maybe a little bit to do or something in our eyes and she begins to think now she remember reading in isaiah 9 and verse 6 unto us a child is born unto us a son is given wonder what that means brother matthew a child is born a son is given has this come to pass yet so she's thinking on these things and i love how the way the prophet of god was saying it now she's stinging on these things she raises her head again and there stands a great light and one walks out of that light the angel gabriel walks out of that light says hell mary thou are highly favored paul church it wasn't a mistake that he walked out of that light let me tell you it wasn't a mistake that you and i have seen that same pillar of fire move in this generation and he's saying hell brad you're highly favored among women oh you're chosen among millions you've been elected among millions you're know predestinated among millions i could have went to this one and that one 712 years he laid in the word but finally that preached all hallelujah that predestinated seed came on the scene and god anointed that seed with life and he's here tonight to anoint that seed that same predestinated sea with the eternal life of the word of god he's here notice now so it came to a virgin 15 16 years old never known a man inspired or a spouse to joseph to be married and the brother branham would say it like this he would say in the in the message mary's belief he said he gave her something to believe that was more outstanding outstanding and hard to believe than anything he ever give anyone if you think about daniel facing the lines harder than that three hebrew boys facing the fiery furnace harder than that the hebrew children mountains on every side the red sea in front of them and pharaoh's army coming up from behind them with vengeance declaring that they're going to destroy them and yet he gave her something to believe that was much harder than that and what was her reply church what was her reply church be it unto me tonight oh god it may seem impossible i don't know how you're going to do it god but i know it land over there in isaiah 9 there's going to be a child born there's going to be a son given lord if it's to me tonight god be it unto me tonight unto thy word let it be stunned six months prior to that the same angel went to zacharias and he was a minister in the tear in the temple again he was told that he and his wife were going to bear a child in their old age and he said how can this be i'm old and my wife is old now you shouldn't be picking on your wife zacharias one thing you never do is talk about how old your wife is i got a young beautiful wife she's not in here to hear it right now but young and beautiful but we find here that he doubted the word how could this be i'm old i got problems god's a master of problems and here this little woman had to believe something that had never happened before having a baby without knowing a man how can these things be because the holy ghost is going to overshadow you oh if that same holy ghost that overshadowed her then can come by here tonight and overshadow some of you oh you don't have to walk out the same that you walked in you don't have to go out packing that same anxiety and that same fear and that same depression and that same nervous spirit you can walk out of here with your held high because why because you met the god of impossibility and he moved on your situation tonight notice now the prophet of god will say like this she didn't question that but hold the handmaid of the lord be it unto me according to thy word and he said if we could just do that if we could just do that that's the only thing that's what god loves that's the only way to get right with god is to take him at your his word excuse me that's the only way that there is to please god is to take him at his word don't trust in your knowledge your reason how can it be done it cannot be done he goes when you reason then you lose the victory when you reason then you lose the victory so we're to cast down reasonings imaginations conscience affections all those things and see what mary did in the message mary's belief the prophet of god would say mary took him at his word and he changed her whole course of natural life for her changed her entire course of her natural life oh what if we could take him in his word tonight oh he said and he will change the course of your life tonight if you'll take him at his word if you're a sinner tonight he will straighten that crooked life of yours out if you're vile and immoral he'll make you appear as a lily he goes if you have cancer tonight he'll make he will change that and give you your health if you have tuberculosis or sickness or some kind of doctors cannot help he will change that for you if you'll just take him at his word tonight can you take him at his word church can you say lord be it unto me tonight i can't figure it out i don't have the answer but lord be it unto me tonight your word declares by your strife i'm already healed i accept it upon the word of god tonight can if you'll believe tonight church if you can believe tonight church i'm here to tell you god will change the course of your natural life you don't have to remain a sinner you don't have to remain sick you don't have to remain dead with the death sentence on you i'm going to tell you god can and god will change your life if you can believe all things are possible nothing impossible with god and nothing impossible with you tonight see mary took him at his word and if we can believe if we can believe tonight if you can believe for your healing tonight you don't have to walk out sick you don't have to walk through those doors feeble the way you walked in you can walk out brother aaron tonight completely delivered and free so should they be saying for you tonight no more afflictions in your body nothing left no trace of it if you can believe tonight in the supernatural if you can believe for deliverance tonight you don't have to walk out bound you don't have to walk out of press living below your god-given privileges you can walk out tonight knowing that your entire natural course of life will be changed if you can believe tonight why did the prophet the angel lord tell brother man if if you can get the people to believe if you can get look that that applies to you brother matthew you brother jason and brother chase that'll play if we can get the people to believe nothing will stand before them nothing will stand before you not even cancer and cancer is considered the worst devil out there in that day i'm going to tell you god is a cancer defeating devil tonight he get it back then he'll do it tonight so no matter what you're facing he's still god and he's still a destroyer of cancer of sugar diabetes of heart trouble of lung trouble whatever it is tonight you put it in there and our god is greater tonight and if i can get you to believe the word nothing will stand before your prayer nothing will stand before your prayer not even cancer amen you see you say well joe how how can cancer be cured when the doctors give it up the prophet of god will say it's not for me to try to figure it out it takes the word of the holy spirit and he's the one who made the promise and he's the one who confirms that promise he's obligated to keep that promise so it's not on who you went to to get prayer it's not on the man's prayer it's on your belief it's on your belief do you believe tonight god wants you to believe in the impossible notice now brother ben would go on to say mary didn't wait till she felt positive you know i know how some of us act because i sit where you sit sometimes and i don't know i don't sit back in the back excuse me i lied that's where you laugh a little bit it's okay but we find many times we don't want to give a testimony because you know it hasn't happened yet we don't have the 400 results yet so i don't want to be a liar no you're not lying you're giving god praise because something's an anchor down in your heart you're not looking at the problem you're not looking at the situation you're looking at the word by his strife i'm already healed i'm going to declare and mary went around declaring before she felt anything she didn't look in the mirror and do that number and see the little baby bump no sir she went praising god i'm going to have a baby i'm going to have a baby i ain't never known a man before but god is going to fulfill isaiah 9 6 and it's coming through my woo and god is here tonight or to bring it through your womb if you can believe the word of god she didn't wait till she felt positive she didn't wait till she felt life or some physical sign that she was going to have a baby no sir she started rejoicing right then she started rejoicing right then mary said behold the handmaid of the lord oh she had a belief for something that had never happened before no woman had ever brought a child like that into the world by not knowing a man but see when you take god at his word you believe it anyhow no matter how impossible it looks to be believe god and he will bring it to pass he will now how many of you believe god sent us a prophet these are not my words these are your words or your the words from your prophet which i truly believe was the word from god to come down on this generation to elevate our faith he knew how bad it was going to get in this age you think covered 19 surprised god you say oh brother joe it's going to get worse yes it's going to get worse but the problem of god said you're always talking about how bad the world's getting but the church all hallelujah she's getting stronger all the time why because the supernatural is showing

supernatural i come to believe that no matter what i face in this life god has got it under control problems say you know what makes the devil mad when you realize you're a son and daughter of god oh when you realize you possess eternal life you possess the same genetic traits the same power the same signs the same wonders at jehovah god that he possesses when he spun the creation out there and he said let it be that same power lies in you tonight oh yes sir there's nothing impossible with god and he said there's nothing impossible with you whatsoever things you desire when you pray believe that you receive it and ye shall have it there was no question mark there was no mistake he didn't stutter at that he said if you can believe tonight whatsoever things you desire when you pray let me tell you if we can just pray tonight and break through to the throne of grace we'll see god move tonight notice now he says now this is in the message the resurrection of lazarus 1951 and if we become notice let me back up he goes i'm part of charles branham because i was born from charlie branham my dad and i'm a part of him i got a forehead like him my hair was like him i'm a small man like him i'm in the nature like him because he's my dad and if we become spirit sons of god deity dwells in that man hold up i don't think y'all caught that i don't think y'all caught that notice now i want you to catch this can realize who you are tonight you're not just joe and and jessica adams or jason and dale excuse me i don't forgot your wife's name so forgive me for that one but that i knew it was debbie it was gonna tip my tongue i was afraid to spit it off we're not just chasing and debbie watkins or matthew watkins or or jason demars or or luther this with your last name and this whatever it may be no we're not just that inside of each of you here that's been born again by the spirit of god dwells deity god himself dwells on the inside of you in the same power the same signs ashamed wonders that he possessed you possess tonight if you can only relinquish that power and let it go and speak your need tonight you'll see god move notice he says that we become in the spirit sons of god deity dwells in the man then you talk about blind eyes being open they said nothing impossible to god god said nothing impossible with you if you'll believe not with god but you deities in man the very god that stood back there on the mythical platform of the eternities and he rode the worlds off of his hands and he created these things he gives you the privilege to be his son and you are a part of him and god dwells in mankind and man himself is deity man himself is deity so what problem what situation is too big for deity notice now what he says here and that same power that same christ hallelujah let the fundamentalists let the people who deny the power of god say it's wrong but the same power that spoke the world into existence is in those people that's got the holy ghost men and women it's time that we found out who you are the devil's trying to hide you back tell you you're you're some little coward down something you're not you're sons and daughters of god deity is not in heaven deities in you tonight oh quit waiting on god to move from heaven i'm going to tell you god is here in this church tonight he's here to move for you tonight and your situation and your situation deity is not in heaven it's here it says bethel tabernacle tonight ready to exploit the devil's schemes ready to uncover his lies notice the deity of jesus christ he said he stood back there he's the creator of all things he made life frogs oh bees ducks chickens animals created everything and nothing was made but was made by him who christ the deity he brought down plagues everything in the days of egypt who christ he stopped the mouth of lions he quenched to violence the violence of fire they escaped the edge of the sword raised the dead from the grave who christ oh my he goes what will it be he said who is it christ the deity he says oh brother sister that deity is in you tonight a little while the world won't see me no more but you shall see me for i'll be with you even in you oh quit putting it off in the future he's here tonight he's god tonight and did he dwells in you tonight he said christ in the ranger no christ in you hallelujah we're not worshiping christ in a manger but it's christ in you the holy ghost the hope of life see the creator god himself dwelling in the human being the mind that was in christ is in you and we believe for the unseen for the miraculous just anything we believe for the unseen we believe for the miraculous we believe for just it don't really matter anything because he's god and i'm his son and i'm his daughter and inside of me deity dwells in me oh it may be just a spoonful of deity but i got diddy no matter what i can call on my father and i know he'll respond and i got faith tonight to call him to the scene to call him on the knee on the on the scene tonight because i believe god is going to respond to the needs of his people notice now mary did not wait until she felt positive i can't drink that that's cold hell is that my voice excuse me let me keep going she didn't wait till she felt positive she was gonna have the child she didn't wait till she felt life before she said anything about it she started right away testifying telling people that she was going to have a baby when there was no sign of it yet now you and i some of us we believe but some of those around them that claim they believe they'll say she's a fanatic she's a holy roller hot in the world for her to consider that thank you brother matt but she didn't wait till the service was over she didn't wait till the preacher said amen you can be dismissed before she started believing she didn't wait for signs and want us to take place she started rejoicing giving glory to god right then what are you trying to say brother joe i'm trying to tell you tonight you don't have to wait till the service is over right there where you are you can stand up and believe and say it's over right now i believe that god is my god that he's a supernatural i don't have to live another minute with the frogs i can be free tonight i can be delivered tonight i can be born again tonight i don't have to be bound any longer i believe god i was preaching like i said four weeks ago tonight and i preached a message god does impossible math actually when i get home this is going to be part two but i had a brother text me or message me on facebook he says i just had the right you to give you my testimony after watching the message impossible math he goes i received my healing from parkinson disease which i've had for over three years yes the doctors proclaimed that there is no cure for this disease see that's what the doctors claim but i'm not listening to the doctor's report he said look how simple it came when i viewed the complex math problem on the wall behind you i knew it couldn't i couldn't touch it yet i knew i believed there was an answer to the problem it was then that i realized in my finite puny mind that and go and just because i didn't have or understand the answer to the problem did not mean that there wasn't one that one didn't exist how great is our god that he loves to take the most difficult problems and solve them he goes oh how that ought to increase our faith he's gonna share this with your congregation cause i'm ready to do a dance the revival it's revival time i say what about a bethel tabernacle if he's the same guy that can deliver from parkinson's four weeks ago he can deliver your situation tonight because he's still god he's still a god of the miraculous he's still a god of the supernatural and brother branham would say i believe if every patient in this building right now would accept it upon the grounds of god's word and believe it and start testifying and praising god for your healing this meeting wouldn't close with one crippled person in here i believe the same god's here tonight if you can just start confessing and start believing and start praising god and start thanking god for your your healing your deliverance whatever it may be you'll see the same god move it's okay to praise god our time sometimes we need a praise break in the house of god get too starchy oh we get two we get too aristocratic i don't want to move like that i understand look i'm not a fool i understand my gift don't bless some of you because i'm not a teacher and you like that that's fine because it's going to impact somebody and that teaching gift don't really bless me a whole lot because i like it fiery i like it hot i like it's coming i want the word but i like to teach in two but i don't get moved by it like i do with that evangelistic but see there's all sorts that's why god said i'll give you a five-fold ministry for the perfecting of the body now let me tell you if we could just have a praise breaking tonight and begin to praise god that he knows what i have need of whether it be hitting you tonight it may be your neighbor it may be your child it may be somebody that you know that's on the live stream stream tonight and yet god is dealing with them and you can pray the prayer of faith and say god send your anointing send your blessing send your holy ghost after night and touch that need deliver that situation god loves he loves to deal with the impossible case because when the doctor said they can't do no more the prophet of god say that's when you're trying to climb off the tree of knowledge you jump on over to the tree of life and keep on moving when they said i can't do it anymore all right i'm stepping off what are you doing you're stepping into faith tonight you're stepping into the supernatural where all things are possible there's not one thing on that tree a lot you can't attain to you can be healed you can be delivered you can be set free because while the tree of life has no wind i said the tree of life has no end we're not eating tonight off the tree of knowledge i did not go to sermons.com and get this message i went before the creator i said god you know the need god you know the need you can feed five thousand with two fish and five loaves surely you can come by tonight and feed bethel tabernacle notice now this virgin birch was a paradox how in the world excuse me could it be scientifically proven come on really think about this we're smart and educated as we heard we had a civilization years ago that created this the pyramids way further advanced than what we are and yet they still could not explain the virgin birth how could this happen because this ain't the results of man's ingenuity it's the work of god because god laid it in the scriptures a virgin is going to conceive a child is going to be given a son is going to be born and in the end time he says i'm going to have a church oh you look at yourself when you got mistakes how many you got mistakes i'm glad i got some honest people here tonight some of you got some flaws but he said i'm gonna have a church without spot without wrinkle without blemish she's gonna be a glorious church i'm talking to you tonight church of god that's who you are quit listen to the lies of the devil telling you you're not this you're never gonna be and you're not good enough oh it's just a lie the enemy god says you can you will you will because why because i've already seen you in a vision going up not down notice now he healed the lepers when there was no cure for leprosy he fed the 5 000 with just merely two fish and five loaves he delivered from the lions then he delivered from the fiery furnace he created a highway through a raging sea and you think your problem's too big for our god oh no he loves the impossible because when man can't figure it out god's sitting back i got this i got this only thing he's waiting on is for you and say take it lord i believe be it unto me notice we find here in mark 11 verse 23 is this okay tonight can i keep going well i'm gonna keep going and ain't telling me nothing he says verily i say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he said therefore i say unto you what things so ever you desire when you pray believe that you receive and you shall have them now this phrase here this scripture these mountains are proverbial and they're supposed to to to look at difficult or impossible situations that's in a christian's path and god is here to tell you no obstacle should be able to stand before a confiding faith in god there's no obstacle that's greater than our god your god is greater than your mountains and your valleys he's greater and god is saying whosoever shall speak to this mountain your mountain may be different excuse me your mountain may be different than my mountain but it's still impossible with us brother timothy and i were texting a while back and i'm going to go into a little bit more of this but he was he and i were texting and he texted me this text he said we are assigned mountains to show others that it can be moved he said david showed others that goliath could be killed shamgar showed others that 600 wasn't enough samson showed others that a thousand wasn't enough daniel showed others that the lines then can be shut the three hebrew children showed others that the fiery furnace can be put out and jesus showed others that death itself can be defeated and i replied to brother timothy and i said god is using your family in our church to prove that he will keep his word and that we can trust him or if we trust him mountains will move goliaths will fall philistines will be defeated fires will be quenched and the lions will be tamed if we believe see god has proven time and time again that he can do the impossible but who is god's agent you are god's agent god performs his impossibilities through your weakness of your humanity see god has proven he's opened a red sea and they walk right on through the hebrew children never before has anybody survived to heat of the flames and yet they walked out without the smell of smoke on their clothes never before has anybody survived a dent of hungry lines oh but daniel said o king i'll see you in the morning when this trial is over i'll see you tomorrow oh come on sons and daughters of god he's still god tonight never before has a man been dead for four days came back to life again stinking decaying body parts already rottening in and yet he walked out alive and not only did he walk out a new man he walked out and god said or jesus said loose him and let him go what was he doing he's saying your past can't hold you oh your past your mistakes can't hold you you come up dead from the grave but i'm not going to let the past hang on you loose them tonight and let them go let them serve god let them worship god let them praise god tonight let the past come off of them and let them be free to serve me again and lazarus walked out in the newness of life oh church i don't know about you but i believe i believe in the power of the resurrection i'm gonna go through some testimonies for you i wish i didn't lost my voice too quick but we're gonna we're gonna press true y'all pray notice now he said the word was good enough for her she said behold the handmaid of the lord being unto me according to thy word and started to rejoicing over it she had to believe the impossible she had to believe for something that never happened and the brother brandon would say and we have to believe to see new life we have to believe the impossible to see new life oh we sung that song he's in the house he's in the house what was once dead has now been made alive because we believe because we believe the doctor says you got cancer you're dying you've got to believe in the impossible to see new life you've got to believe when the doctor says you'll never walk in you've got to believe in the impossible to see new life come into you new life into their fibers oh god bring forth a new hand a new arm a new lung new stomach whatever it is god will do it if you'll take him at his word god will do it if you take him at his word how many of you know the story of sister beth dingle seriously beth dingle was diagnosed as a kid with the form of leukemia there was no known cure it killed everybody that it came in contact with they had to rewrite history they had to change the report because why she's the known the only lone survivor of this form of leukemia and so i asked you tonight you go and ask sister beth does god do the impossible i promise you she'll say yes see the odds are now one in a million and she's at one you could be that one too tonight you could be that one brother ron spencer many of you know the situation with brother ryan with cancer right he goes to an oncologist twice a week or every two weeks excuse me the last time he was greeted by the doctor the doctor said i know you're feeling better because your lives have dropped wonderfully in two weeks his liver levels had dropped and she decided to drop his steroids from four pills today to three and recheck him on july 23rd he said if they continue to drop shield she'll take them or she'll up his chemotherapy she said those cancer cells are dying the mri of the liver and the pancreas show no cancer when he was first diagnosed he was given four months to live oh church he's still alive today why because he believed in a god of impossibility he believed in a god that's greater than cancer he believed in a god that has a better report than the doctor's report amen many of you know brother cadre dicks he had cancer as a 15 year old kid entering ninth grade he started having headaches and loss of appetite it became unbearably took him to the er they found he had a cancerous tumor on his brain and they did surgery and they removed it with just a few weeks later he found that they had cancer all in his neck excuse me and he refused chemotherapy and god miraculously healed him and he's still preaching this gospel today you can't tell me god don't do the impossible we had a little girl in our church mariah put she had alopecia they said there's no known cure for it i think she was 10 or 11 years old at the time lost all her hair oh she come to a youth camp with some bobby pins in her hand and she walked through a prayer line she goes when i get to the other side i'm going to wear these again let me take god begin to restore the glory and if god can do that for a little girl what can god do for you tonight she woke up one morning heard her mother in there listening to a tape and at the end of the tape it began to sing i can i will i do believe that the lord heals me now and she began to sing and she wrote on her door i can i will i do believe and if i can get you to say that tonight i can i will i do believe every devil is defeated every cancer is defeated every situation is defeated i can i will i do believe tonight i believe in the god of impossibilities i believe tonight there's nothing impossible with god and there's nothing impossible with me because deity lies on the inside some of you may have heard of sister karen's recent attack four weeks ago till tomorrow she woke up to go use the restroom she was experiencing fear headaches brother tim decided to take her to the er and on the way she began to vomit and she got worse she got to a point where she couldn't even talk and because of covert 19 they wouldn't allow brother tim into the er so brother timothy called me about one o'clock in the morning said brother joe could you do something could you go up there so i got on my clothes and went up and i prayed with sister karen because brother tim couldn't get back there and uh i prayed with her and and i stayed there until they transferred it to a bigger facility that had a neurologist and as i was there waiting i went to the doctor i said doc can i see her scan he said sure so he shows me the image of her brain he starts clicking through the mri and going through screen by screen or slide by slide because it's a slice so he's going through there and he showed me he says you see this middle line here there's a kind of a clear white line through the middle of the brain i said yeah he said you see all this here her previous brain bleeds have been down here in the bottom about this big her entire left side of her brain was full of blood not this big the entire left side of her brain from the front to the back was full of blood and the blood was pushing the brain matter over to the right side and she she had what they called a midline shift i said okay doc i said how bad is this because she's had two brain bleeds before and she's done well he looked at me he said she can live another five minutes and she can live another five years but she will not have a quality of life i looked at him brother matt i said well we're just gonna believe that god's gonna do the impossible i just preached on the god of impossibilities a god does impossible math so i was a little bit stoked i said yeah we got this you know i'm not a clinician i knew it was bad because they told brother tim you tell us you want her on life support or not get ready because she may not make it through surgery so she made it the very next morning they shipped her to ochsner which is a hospital big hospital teaching facility in shreveport they done emergency brain surgery in the morning to relieve the blood off the brain and every day from then she began to improve and improve and brother tim would begin to talk to her and she would squeeze his hand now she was supposed to be a vegetable she was supposed to not have a quality of life she was supposed to not be able to walk again she was supposed to not be able to think again to walk again i'm going to testify she went home yesterday a healed woman why because he's the god of the impossibilities there's nothing to impossible with god and there's nothing to impossible with you if you can believe god she went home and she's rejoicing in her right mind got full control of our motor skills why because we serve a mighty god we serve a miracle-working god we serve a supernatural god and there's nothing let me hear me there's nothing impossible with god and there's nothing impossible with you if you can believe god oh yeah we facetimed her from the beach the other night and she's talking and she's doing everything great and she wasn't supposed to be alive i said she wasn't supposed to be alive she could live five minutes maybe five years but she will not have a quality of life notice every one of these that i read to you had a death sentence on them but they believed they believed and we believe tonight they believed in the impossible and new life came and if you can believe tonight for the impossible new life it's on its way if you can believe for the impossible i said new life it's on its way i don't know what you're going through tonight i don't know what mountain you're facing i don't know what obstacle you're facing i don't know what devil you're facing but i know one thing our god is greater there's not been a mountain too high there's not been a valley too low there's not been a devil too strong that but what our god can't get to victory and if i can get you to believe tonight your situation will be nothing in the eyes of god that thing that's been tormenting you that cancer or that torment or that that that anxiety or that depression whatever it is it's got to go in the name of jesus christ peter oh god told peter says i give you the keys tonight peter whatever you loose on earth will be loose in heaven and whatever you bind on earth will be bound to them i say we defy you satan tonight in the name of jesus you hinder in spirit we bind you in the name of jesus christ you anxiety you nervous you fear your depression we bind you tonight you can't stand you can't stand we serve a decree tonight lose them and let them go i say look something and let them go stand to your feet and worship god loose them tonight musicians come oh he told peter whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven and whatsoever you loose on earth it'll be loose in heaven god we loose the anointing of the holy spirit tonight move upon your people lord move upon your people tonight may there be no sickness hold them there there'll be no torment hold them may there'll be no spirit hold them tonight no we bind it tonight and we loose the anointing of the supernatural god we believe we believe tonight therefore we speak we speak life we speak deliverance we speak resurrection power tonight we speak it in the name of jesus and you say when a son of god takes that word and places upon his lips it's the same as deity speaking satan you've bound these people too long you've held them long enough i said you held them long enough tonight you gotta go we find you tonight we bind cancer we bind fear we bind a nervous spirit we buy whatever it may be that's come and attack the people of god we bind it tonight you gotta lose some and let them go to serve god and we loose the anointing of the end time message upon the people we enluge the anointing of the holy ghost and we say like mary said be it unto me tonight according to thy word oh god may you come tonight may i sweep over this church tonight god and you'll fill us up fresh in the new may the anointing of the holy ghost sweep down tonight and make god of miraculous wonders may your reign tonight over every situation over every problem over every trial over every situation god we believe tonight [Music] we believe in the possibilities we believe we believe i said we believe lord sing that song he's in the house you got a need tonight i know we're in those restrictions jesus you don't let those restrictions bind you tonight and keep you from moving with god you got to believe if you got a need tonight you need prayer make your way to the altar we'll pray for you i'm not scared of coping 19 because i serve a big god if he can never deliver brain bleeds if he can deliver alopecia if he can heal from cancer surely he can move in the house of god tonight without fear without worry without anxiety you gotta need he still god won't you make your way forward tonight and say lord i believe i'm stepping out of the house and i i'm going to take at your words and i i'm going to say like mary said be it unto me tonight lord i don't understand how you're going to do it it ain't meant for me to try to figure it out god i believe therefore i speak brother matt is his name he's in the house oh death has to and please there is light where
