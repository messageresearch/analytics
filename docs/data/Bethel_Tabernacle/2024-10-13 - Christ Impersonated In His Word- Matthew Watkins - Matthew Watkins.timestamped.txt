[26:03] just want you to if you could turn to
[26:05] your Bible to the book of First John
[26:10] um very familiar 1 John chapter
[26:15] 1 and I would like to just minister to
[26:18] you this morning we we have a quite a
[26:23] bit to do after the uh service today and
[26:26] so I just want to make sure that got out
[26:28] clear um I sent out that announcement
[26:31] that we're going to be starting Lord
[26:32] willing at 1:30 p.m. we'll start uh to
[26:36] take down disassemble and to load up the
[26:40] U-Haul and so uh just get there will be
[26:43] those that uh will be in charge of that
[26:45] and so we just hands as many of them as
[26:47] possible raise up your hand say right
[26:49] here if you got a right hand raise it up
[26:51] raise it up if you got a right hand if
[26:52] you don't have one don't raise it you
[26:54] got a left hand raise up that left hand
[26:56] too now you see all those hands those
[26:58] those hands are important and they're
[27:00] going to be really important today so
[27:01] you say well what can I do to help just
[27:03] use those hands and uh it'll help us
[27:06] tremendously there's a lot that goes
[27:07] into it and so uh we got quite a bit
[27:10] there that uh we've got to load up so if
[27:13] you're able at all to come at 1:30 I'm
[27:16] going to do my best to be abbreviated
[27:18] today and um I'm going to set a timer
[27:22] and I know some of y'all are going to
[27:24] show how much you don't believe in
[27:26] miracles when I say this
[27:29] but I'm going to try to hold my sermon
[27:30] to 40 to 45
[27:33] minutes and so um we'll see how that
[27:37] goes but um I really want to my dad is a
[27:40] way Minister and we just want to
[27:41] remember him in Phoenix and Arizona he's
[27:44] ministering this morning there a few
[27:45] hours behind he possibly would be
[27:47] streaming this so we want to be
[27:50] remembered him and any others uh that
[27:52] are out ministering amen 1 John chapter
[27:55] 1 we'll just begin reading here at verse
[27:58] seven let's let's back it up and let's
[28:01] move to verse five this then is the
[28:04] message which we have heard of him and
[28:07] declare unto you that God is light and
[28:11] in him is no Darkness at all if we say
[28:15] that we have fellowship with him and
[28:17] walk in darkness we lie you see the
[28:20] impossibility because there's no
[28:22] darkness in him at all so if we say we
[28:24] walk with him and we walk in darkness
[28:27] then we we lie and do not the truth but
[28:30] if we walk in the light as he is in the
[28:34] light we have Fellowship one with
[28:36] another and the blood of Jesus Christ
[28:39] his son cleanses us so notice what the
[28:42] light brings cleansing what is the only
[28:45] thing that can cleanse you tell me
[28:48] somebody what is the only thing that
[28:50] brings cleansing power the blood only
[28:53] one so the light is connected to the
[28:56] blood right so if let's read it again if
[28:59] we walk in the light as he is in the
[29:01] light we have Fellowship one with
[29:04] another and the blood of Jesus Christ
[29:07] his son cleanses us from all sin if we
[29:11] say that we have no sin we deceive
[29:14] ourselves and the truth is not in US
[29:17] here's the beautiful part but if we
[29:18] confess our sins he is faithful and just
[29:21] to forgive our sins and to cleanse us
[29:24] from all
[29:25] unrighteousness Lord we just need your
[29:27] help this morning I know father that
[29:30] there would be so many here Lord that
[29:32] would gather and Lord they are here for
[29:35] one purpose and that's to see you Lord
[29:38] uh I just want to say today God may we
[29:41] see you Lord hide me behind the cross
[29:44] this morning Lord let let us have a true
[29:47] Mount Transfiguration experience where
[29:49] we see no man but we see Jesus I pray
[29:53] God that you would touch every heart
[29:54] touch every life Lord May the word find
[29:57] its proper place place today we ask it
[29:59] in Jesus Christ's name and the church
[30:01] said amen you can be seated if you'll
[30:04] give me that PowerPoint brother Mark
[30:06] I'll just go ahead and read this first
[30:08] uh uh quote here and this is where I
[30:10] draw my title from my title is Christ
[30:15] impersonated in his word Christ
[30:19] impersonated in his word I want you to
[30:22] notice because I'm going to be very
[30:24] brief and and uh this morning and rather
[30:26] than laying a large Foundation would us
[30:28] get straight to some of the meat of this
[30:30] of what we got what we have on our
[30:32] heart Christ
[30:34] impersonated in his word so you have two
[30:38] things there you have Christ and you
[30:40] have his word and so then you have this
[30:43] word in the middle impersonated now not
[30:45] in the sense of being impersonated like
[30:48] an impersonator person who's a mockery
[30:51] or making fun of or impersonate another
[30:53] person but break that word down it's
[30:56] Christ in impersonated so the person of
[31:01] Christ being revealed in his word you
[31:05] followed me so far so notice what
[31:07] brother brandham says here and this is
[31:09] out of the message the Feast of the
[31:10] trumpets in 1964 and I know it's very
[31:13] familiar to you and the seventh Angel's
[31:16] message under the same trumpet same
[31:20] everything exactly the same seal is to
[31:24] what to call the people the bride out of
[31:28] that's the elected not the church but
[31:31] the bride it's to call the bride out of
[31:34] the Pentecostal and World Tradition now
[31:38] if you go and read this message the
[31:40] Feast of the trumpets you'll know
[31:42] clearly that the prophet is picking up
[31:45] from pointing to what the prophets of
[31:47] Revelations chap 11 show and and you see
[31:51] that the entire sermon is about the Jews
[31:53] and Israel being called back by a Moses
[31:57] and Elijah to the genuine atonement to
[32:00] the true word and so brother bam is
[32:03] paralleling the the what the the what
[32:06] the the Gentiles receive an Elijah and
[32:09] so also the Jews will recognize their
[32:13] prophets can you say amen amen and so
[32:16] he's paralleling that and he says here
[32:18] out of the so also the seventh Angel's
[32:21] message under the same trumpet same
[32:23] everything the same seal is to do what
[32:26] to call the people the bride
[32:28] out of the Pentecostal and World
[32:30] tradition to the genuine atonement the
[32:35] word so what is the genuine atonement
[32:38] Christ
[32:39] impersonated in his word or Christ
[32:42] becoming the person of his word notice
[32:47] here he says impersonated here he says
[32:51] his word made flesh Among Us science has
[32:56] proved it by pictures so notice here as
[32:58] brother Brandon begins to show this here
[33:00] and and I just want to make sure I don't
[33:02] want to read this next slide yet um uh
[33:06] let me make sure I have this correctly
[33:07] yes so notice he says Christ
[33:10] impersonated in his word we took a long
[33:12] time last Sunday the last Sunday that we
[33:15] spoke and we spoke quite a bit about
[33:17] light you remember that sermon that we
[33:19] that we spoke on don't make me repr
[33:20] preach it you remember what I spoke
[33:22] about with light and so we took a lot of
[33:25] time to show you that there was a re
[33:27] ation that was uh uh revealed or a
[33:30] mystery that was broken in this age of
[33:34] first John 1:7 that Christ that God is
[33:37] light and there was a mystery
[33:39] surrounding the light we showed you that
[33:42] also that you'll find in Revelations 4 a
[33:45] throne is revealed and it wasn't a
[33:46] literal throne but it was all symbology
[33:49] that there was a throne and and around
[33:52] that Throne were the seven stars of God
[33:54] and and in the right hand of God meaning
[33:57] the position of authority that God said
[33:59] out of the throne in the throne dwells
[34:02] the light and surrounding the light God
[34:04] says that there's 24 Elders that was 12
[34:07] Tribes of 12 sons of Jacob and the the
[34:10] representing the Jews and the 12 tribes
[34:12] of Israel I'm sorry uh uh the 12
[34:14] apostles represented the Gentile church
[34:17] and so notice he was we were showing you
[34:19] that to get to Christ to get to the
[34:21] throne you've got to come under the
[34:24] light you will never have light unless
[34:26] you receive it from one of the stars
[34:29] that God has in his right hand and so
[34:32] any man doesn't matter Jew Gentile study
[34:34] Torah study the Greek manuscript Hebrew
[34:37] manuscript study Theology and all of
[34:40] these all of these things that they go
[34:42] to school for for years the only light
[34:45] that they can receive from God must come
[34:49] from the source of Light which is Christ
[34:52] which is God which is Jehovah which is
[34:53] all the same thing and so it has to come
[34:56] from God it has to come from that Throne
[34:59] of God because in the throne is the
[35:02] embodiment of all of the light of God
[35:05] and so notice the Bible says that in the
[35:07] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[35:09] all the mysteries of God the mystery of
[35:11] God will be revealed So within the
[35:14] seventh Angel's message contain the
[35:17] mystery of God friends I I I I I want
[35:21] you this this is incredible to me when
[35:23] you look at this because you'll find
[35:25] that brother bham is taking time that
[35:28] as a doning on himself who he was in the
[35:32] scripture who his ministry was in the
[35:35] scripture the anointing that he was
[35:37] under because early on he didn't
[35:39] understand the lion anointing the ox
[35:42] anointing the the man anointing the
[35:44] eagle anointing but there was a
[35:46] transition in his own Ministry when he
[35:49] recognizes that he's under that Elijah
[35:52] Ministry of Malachi 4 and he's also not
[35:56] only under an El Ministry but he puts
[35:59] his Bible on Joshua 1 and says as I was
[36:02] with
[36:04] Moses amen so shall I be with you so you
[36:08] say what is that seventh Angel's message
[36:10] it's the ministry of Moses a prophet God
[36:13] sent a prophet to call uh God sent Moses
[36:15] a prophet to call Israel out of Egypt so
[36:19] we have also received a Moses Messenger
[36:23] to call us out of world
[36:25] Traditions unto a genuine atonement so
[36:28] what have you received in under the
[36:29] seventh angel you received a Moses to
[36:32] call you out of the plagues of Egypt and
[36:35] give you a token somebody preached with
[36:37] me this morning that is not just for you
[36:40] but for all of your
[36:42] family and it was to bring a token under
[36:45] a Moses Ministry but don't stop there he
[36:47] wasn't just a Moses he was also the Holy
[36:50] Ghost Ministry of Joshua as I was with
[36:53] Moses so shall I be unto you but further
[36:57] than that that he was an Elijah
[37:00] Ministry to turn the hearts of the
[37:03] children back to the faith of the
[37:05] fathers but and all of that I I want you
[37:09] to I want to make sure I cover this very
[37:11] important key uh here today and that is
[37:14] who is the seventh angel yeah amen
[37:18] question who is the seventh
[37:21] angel who was the sixth who was the
[37:24] fifth who was the fourth who was the
[37:26] third who was the second who was the
[37:29] first yeah well let me ask you what the
[37:31] Bible says about John the Baptist the
[37:35] Bible says that
[37:37] John who was to do what was to introduce
[37:41] Christ how many knows that John's
[37:43] Ministry was the ministry of the Book of
[37:45] Malachi chapter 3 and chapter 4 the
[37:48] hearts of the children notice this now
[37:50] there would be a parallel between John
[37:52] who was under the anointing of Elijah
[37:55] and then the anointing that would also
[37:57] that Jesus says Elijah must did come but
[38:01] he must also come and restore all things
[38:03] so what was the first Ministry of John
[38:06] it was to
[38:08] introduce Jesus
[38:10] Christ how many Bible readers do we have
[38:12] here this morning it was to introduce to
[38:15] say Behold the Lamb of God and John
[38:19] would say I am not that light but I've
[38:23] come to Bear witness unto that light
[38:25] Hallelujah so if John was not the light
[38:28] then how could any of the messengers be
[38:30] the light they weren't they were simply
[38:33] the
[38:34] bearers of that
[38:38] light and so to back to our original
[38:41] point to get light from the throne God
[38:43] said here's how it's going to come I'm
[38:45] going to have in my right hand which
[38:47] means Authority and power I'm going to
[38:50] equip them with a special Ministry and
[38:52] in my right hand is Seven Stars and
[38:55] through Seven Ages there would be a
[38:57] start to each age and if you lived under
[39:00] the light of that messenger you were
[39:03] walking in the light as he is in the
[39:08] light and that light brought cleansing
[39:11] and atonement amen I want you to notice
[39:15] because it's so powerful because as we
[39:17] said you have to understand that the
[39:19] mystery surrounding the nature of God
[39:21] was sealed and I don't want to get
[39:23] bogged down into that we took a lot of
[39:25] time uh showing you that that under Dan
[39:27] CH 12 that there was a mystery that was
[39:30] sealed up you remember that how many
[39:31] hands could could just raise and say I I
[39:33] remember the scripture in Daniel Daniel
[39:35] seal up the book don't write the you
[39:37] know seal it up Daniel for knowledge
[39:39] shall increase many shall run to and fro
[39:41] and no notice here so there was a
[39:43] mystery contained in that but then
[39:46] Revelations 10:7 says that the mystery
[39:48] of God under that seventh messenger
[39:51] would be finished so in other words they
[39:54] couldn't understand God until the voice
[39:56] of that Angel sounds and so a as as that
[40:01] light begins to come I want you to
[40:03] notice because brother Adam starts
[40:05] preaching a series of messages and if
[40:07] you've never caught it before in this
[40:09] way I I hope I could just show you in a
[40:11] way that it for me it was just a a light
[40:14] bulb no pun intended light bulb moment
[40:17] there because you notice even the titles
[40:20] that brother bam starts to name his
[40:22] sermons because he's trying to get the
[40:25] people to understand something has taken
[40:29] place this isn't just normal
[40:31] churchianity this isn't just normal
[40:33] filling time this isn't this is a profit
[40:36] this is a a gift of Divine Healing but
[40:38] it's not just a gift of Divine Healing
[40:40] amen
[40:43] hello it's it's a gift of Divine Healing
[40:46] but it's not just a gift of Divine
[40:50] Healing find my place here I want to
[40:53] want to make sure I get to this because
[40:54] it was yes thank you Lord so notice this
[40:58] here how you view Jesus I want to say
[41:02] this slowly will determine what you get
[41:06] from Jesus
[41:09] amen how many knows here today that if
[41:12] you were to ask a thousand people you
[41:15] would have almost a thousand different
[41:18] opinions if you ask them who is
[41:21] Jesus now you'd have a lot of gen
[41:24] generally the same but you would have
[41:25] varying opinions but remember how you
[41:28] view him will determine what you get out
[41:31] of him I don't have this on the slides
[41:33] but listen to what brother bam says in
[41:34] the identified Christ of all ages so
[41:37] many people have so many opinions of
[41:40] Christ as I travel different parts of
[41:43] the country and around the world I find
[41:45] so many people have their different
[41:47] opinions you you'd be surprised to know
[41:49] what their opinions are some of them
[41:50] thinks that he's just a wonderful
[41:53] teacher you ask a Muslim that the
[41:56] Muslims will tell you further than that
[41:57] he was a
[41:59] prophet but some would just believe he
[42:01] was just a teacher right well now listen
[42:05] how brother B says this well now he was
[42:09] that he was a wonderful teacher yeah but
[42:13] remember what I said how you view him
[42:16] will determine what you get out of him
[42:19] so in other words if you just viewed
[42:22] Jesus as a wonderful teacher what would
[42:24] you get you'd get good teaching
[42:28] amen so if you viewed him as a wonderful
[42:31] teacher you'd get good teaching that's
[42:33] all you'd get from him well he was that
[42:36] that's just exactly many thinks that he
[42:38] was a great philosopher brother brandham
[42:41] says he was that so if you viewed him as
[42:44] a great philosopher what would you get
[42:47] out of him
[42:48] philosophy right amen well he was that
[42:52] just exactly the same certainly he was
[42:54] some thinks that he was a good man how
[42:57] many would raise their hand and say I
[42:58] believe Jesus was a good man
[43:02] amen he was that but see he was more
[43:07] than that oh yeah I love how brother mam
[43:10] says this he was all of that plus
[43:15] amen some of them think he was a prophet
[43:19] he was a prophet but he was more than a
[43:24] prophet he was what the prophets were
[43:28] was plus am somebody say
[43:32] plus he was what the prophets was plus
[43:37] so what would we know now if he was
[43:39] teaching his teachings he was a teacher
[43:41] he was a great philosopher now then
[43:43] brother Brandon points to Hebrews and
[43:45] says we believe that he's the same
[43:49] yesterday today and forever how many
[43:52] believe that if Jesus is the same today
[43:55] yesterday and today and forever then if
[43:56] he was a good man he's still a good man
[43:58] if he was a good teacher he's still a
[44:00] good teacher he's all of those things he
[44:02] was he still is right and so he says and
[44:06] I'm always with you I'll never forsake
[44:08] you until the end of the world I'll
[44:10] never leave one of the one of the
[44:12] principles about the Bible that brother
[44:14] random said was the key to unlock the
[44:16] Bible was this that God doesn't
[44:19] change I'm so glad for that how many are
[44:23] glad for that I'm so glad God doesn't
[44:26] change
[44:27] Hallelujah so in other words if I can
[44:29] meet him on the basis of the word he has
[44:32] to give me the same result cuz he
[44:35] doesn't
[44:35] change and so brother B sister now those
[44:38] words are either true or they're not
[44:40] true and he says and if they're not true
[44:44] if Jesus is just historical and he's not
[44:48] the same and he's not alive and he's not
[44:51] existing and he's not still
[44:54] speaking then what are we doing here
[44:57] right it's words brother Brandon uses
[45:00] then what are we doing here the words
[45:02] are either not and if they're not what
[45:04] are we doing here tonight in other words
[45:07] we're wretched people we're people
[45:09] that's deceived the whole Christian
[45:10] world is deceived if he isn't the same
[45:15] yesterday today and forever you see
[45:18] people are so comfortable with a God
[45:22] that you can lock up in a book
[45:27] amen help me preach
[45:28] somebody the human mind is so
[45:31] comfortable as long as you seal him to
[45:34] one
[45:35] book because you see when he's not still
[45:38] speaking and that's what the God
[45:40] everything God said he said already and
[45:42] we have it in his word then what you can
[45:43] do is is you can have opinions about
[45:45] this and opinions about that and well I
[45:47] see it differently over here and there's
[45:49] textual variance if you look at the
[45:50] manuscript the Mark chapter 7 uh you
[45:54] know was wasn't the woman at the well
[45:55] was not origin
[45:57] in the Bible and and then the woman at
[45:59] the well wasn't and you know Jesus said
[46:01] these signs shall follow you can have
[46:03] all kinds of opinions if you seal him in
[46:05] a book that's right but when Christ was
[46:08] revealed through a seventh Angel's
[46:10] message it revealed Christ has been
[46:15] unveiled and he's not just the god of
[46:17] history but he's the I am present tense
[46:20] God and not only did he speak he's still
[46:25] speaking amen list L what brother
[46:27] brandom says I love this so much he says
[46:29] if he isn't alive tonight and with us as
[46:31] he promised we're we're miserable notice
[46:34] this they're either true or they're not
[46:37] true so notice what brother Bron begins
[46:40] to say as he as as as a transition has
[46:43] taken place as something has changed
[46:46] there's been there's been a a a a as
[46:49] brother bandam calls it concerning the
[46:51] seventh seal he says that there's been a
[46:53] beat I think is the word he uses of the
[46:56] Symphony yeah
[46:59] changes and so he said there's a there's
[47:01] a transition there's a junction of
[47:04] there's a junction there there's a
[47:05] transition something is taking place and
[47:08] he's showing this here and he begins to
[47:10] change the titles he begins to give the
[47:13] titles I want you to catch some of these
[47:15] because he begins to title his his
[47:18] sermons and and then he would preach
[47:20] messages like this who do you
[47:23] say this is yeah amen
[47:27] recognizing your
[47:29] day and its
[47:32] message the God of this it's one thing
[47:37] to see the god of that evil age but the
[47:41] God of this evil
[47:44] age this day this day this scripture is
[47:50] fulfilled are you catching it amen
[47:52] notice the title of this sermon in
[47:54] 1964 a greater than Solomon is here now
[47:59] that's in the Bible remember in the Book
[48:00] of Matthew Jesus says I say unto you
[48:02] there's one greater than than Solomon
[48:05] one greater than the temple but listen
[48:06] to the title of this prophet's message a
[48:09] greater than Solomon is here now amen
[48:14] amen listen right after that the
[48:19] identified Christ of all
[48:23] ages notice this the presence then he
[48:26] preaches a message called the presence
[48:28] of God
[48:31] unrecognized are you seeing that there's
[48:33] a there's a there's a theme
[48:35] Here notice what he preaches right after
[48:37] that God has provided a lamb amen here's
[48:43] another one the Mighty God
[48:47] unveiled before
[48:50] us not who he was but who he is then he
[48:54] preaches a powerful one that I love so
[48:56] much much who is this
[49:02] MDC oh I know who mzc was brother Matt
[49:05] when he appeared to Abraham and to Sarah
[49:07] there but I say unto you who is this mzc
[49:12] because brother bandman that sermon
[49:13] shows that mzc comes three times
[49:15] threefolds three-fold purpose and so he
[49:18] says who is this mzc I listed these and
[49:23] these were so amazing just out of the
[49:24] message is this the sign of the answer
[49:27] and if you want this document I I'll get
[49:30] it I'll get it to you because I believe
[49:32] it's just so good to study I want you to
[49:34] notice you say brother mat what
[49:35] Mysteries were restored under that
[49:38] seventh messenger if that revelation of
[49:41] that message was to do this to turn the
[49:44] hearts of the children back to the
[49:45] fathers what are some of those Mysteries
[49:47] s incredible I actually can find and you
[49:49] may find more 17 Mysteries that were
[49:53] restored under the message of Malachi
[49:56] four that he lists in is this the sign
[49:59] of the end Ser powerful let me read you

[53:38] Prophet said the mystery of the pillar
[53:41] of fire returning back to the church
[53:44] amen amen those were all Mysteries that
[53:48] were contained and restored I want you
[53:51] to notice here because even brother
[53:53] brandham says this in the message Christ
[53:55] is revealed in his own word so let me
[53:58] pause that for a moment so in other
[54:00] words what is brother bam doing through
[54:02] those titles he's trying to get you to
[54:03] see something that's taking place here
[54:06] there's a there's a there's a ministry
[54:08] that's beyond a man it's beyond a man
[54:12] it's beyond a Kentucky seventh grade
[54:14] education it's beyond signs and wonders
[54:17] thank God for the miraculous thank God
[54:19] for the dead being raised thank God for
[54:22] blind eyes being open how many are
[54:24] thankful that God is the god of Miracles
[54:26] how many are thankful that we witness
[54:28] those the miraculous in the ministry of
[54:31] a seventh angel so that I can have faith
[54:34] that that same God is the same God today
[54:37] as he was back then and he still
[54:39] performs the same Miracles but can I
[54:42] just say it's none of those things that
[54:45] attracts me to the message of the
[54:46] seventh
[54:48] angel you say then what was it brother
[54:50] Matt that was just to get the attention
[54:52] when the when those uh when those Fish
[54:55] Little Fish scattered the rainbow TR you
[54:57] say what was it then it was the
[54:59] revelation of the
[55:01] word which is Christ the same yesterday
[55:04] today and forever being revealed once
[55:07] again say how was he revealed he was
[55:11] impersonated in human
[55:14] flesh and so notice I want you to get
[55:16] this here and go ahead and and if you
[55:18] could I want you to listen to this this
[55:20] is this is incredible I want you to play
[55:22] that for me brother Mark if you could
[55:24] have the computer unmuted I I want you
[55:26] just to play this I'm just going to it's
[55:28] probably 10 minutes long I only play a
[55:30] minute of it I just want you to hear a
[55:31] snippet of this I want to show you
[55:33] something go ahead and start that at any
[55:34] time and in the back two if you can make
[55:36] sure wow turn it up thison shared with
[55:40] us the invisible Union of the of Christ
[55:43] there's a lot to uned yeah a lot
[55:45] Thanksgiving Day 1965 Life Tabernacle
[55:48] stre Port Louisiana pretty intense yeah
[55:51] and you know scene Thanksgiving
[55:53] gratitude all of that and uses the woman
[55:57] to illustrate the church well it's
[55:58] really interesting how he connects the
[56:00] natural world to the spiritual right
[56:02] he's taking something that everyone
[56:04] understands this idea of marriage to
[56:06] kind of explain this really complex
[56:08] relationship between the church and
[56:10] Christ and he's saying you know just
[56:12] like a woman's action they kind of show
[56:14] her character the church's actions they
[56:16] reflect its Devotion to Christ and he
[56:18] really does seem to be saying that how
[56:19] at least in 1965 how women were behaving
[56:22] showed that the church was drifting from
[56:24] the word yeah he really calls out you
[56:26] know what's going on in the world even
[56:28] using examples of you know what movie
[56:31] stars are doing on screen how that
[56:33] influences young people right like
[56:35] they're setting a bad example exactly
[56:37] and then you got these fashion trends he
[56:40] actually calls women's clothing insane
[56:42] and talks about these parties where
[56:44] women are picking keys out of a hat to
[56:46] figure out who they're going to live
[56:47] with for the weekend why so he's saying
[56:50] that Society is influencing the church
[56:52] in a bad way yeah I mean this is 1965
[56:55] time massive of people you got Civil
[56:58] Rights Movement the Vietnam War women
[57:00] are pushing for more rights and freedoms
[57:02] and grah sees all of this change
[57:04] especially when it comes to women's rol
[57:06] as a sign of spiritual decline but he's
[57:08] saying the world is going one way and
[57:09] the church is just following right along
[57:11] instead of sticking to those Poe
[57:13] teachings makes sense he get into
[57:14] denominations doesn't it he calls them
[57:17] adulterous strong words yeah so what's
[57:20] going on there okay so for GR it all
[57:22] goes down to this that pure direct
[57:25] connection of God that's what matters he
[57:28] sees denominations as this kind of like
[57:31] I don't know a betrayal of that direct
[57:33] link like you're basically saying okay
[57:36] I'm going to follow these manmade rules
[57:37] and traditions instead of just listening
[57:40] to God directly it's like he's saying
[57:42] you can't serve two Master it's about
[57:43] that direct line no middle okay stop it
[57:47] there now I got a question for you who
[57:50] did you just hear who were those
[57:52] podcasters what show is that brother
[57:54] Matt can you give me the link that woman
[57:56] and that man that I heard that man and
[57:59] that woman don't
[58:02] exist that was artificial intelligence
[58:06] Google Gemini speaking to
[58:11] you I'll let that settle just for a
[58:15] moment some of y'all just went
[58:18] white that man doesn't exist never has
[58:21] that woman never existed that was me
[58:23] taking the invisible Union sermon
[58:26] uploading it took 3 seconds spitting out
[58:29] the podcast took five
[58:31] minutes and it's a full summary of two
[58:35] people rationalizing and reasoning that
[58:38] sermon artificial
[58:41] intelligence now I want to show you what
[58:43] God's Prophet said listen to Christ as
[58:45] revealed in his own word if you can put
[58:47] that PowerPoint back up for me then it
[58:50] started right back coming back come back
[58:54] from the feet now notice as brother
[58:56] brandham shows that
[58:58] restoration and he shows how it started
[59:01] God begin to come up through the feet
[59:03] what is what are we talking about feet
[59:05] for because we're talking about a body
[59:06] what body the body of Christ and he says
[59:09] it started coming right up the church
[59:12] come from the
[59:13] feet now it's in the head
[59:17] time notice the light you can't see with
[59:21] your hands how many would
[59:23] agree yet it's part of the body how many
[59:26] would agree you can't see with the ears
[59:29] yet it it can hear you can't see with
[59:32] the nose yet it smells you can't see
[59:36] with the lips though it speaks see that
[59:40] was the Pentecostal age why does he
[59:44] point to that because through Martin
[59:46] through Luther through Wesley you were
[59:48] moving up through the feet through the
[59:49] body what were you getting in that you
[59:51] were the the
[59:53] restoration all of it was typing a rest
[59:56] restoration of
[59:57] Christ approaching or moving back to his
[1:00:02] body so Christ was cast out but he's
[1:00:05] coming
[1:00:07] back the same Jesus who you stand why
[1:00:10] stand you gazing men of Galilee the same
[1:00:12] Jesus who ascended shall also descend
[1:00:15] shall also come back but you see so many
[1:00:18] people have so many opinions of Christ
[1:00:20] they see The Return of Christ as one
[1:00:22] great event that just trumpet sound and
[1:00:25] then you know down out of this plane or
[1:00:27] this skies are going to roll back and
[1:00:29] this carpet's going to come down and
[1:00:31] then Jesus is going to come back and and
[1:00:33] they think that's the return of Christ
[1:00:34] now you say brother Matt do you believe
[1:00:36] that there's a physical Corporal I do
[1:00:38] but I believe what the Bible said that
[1:00:40] we meet that Jesus in the
[1:00:43] air what is that that's not in the air
[1:00:46] that's in the atmosphere the dimensions
[1:00:49] between this one and that one remember
[1:00:52] what brother brandom says when you die
[1:00:54] when you breathe your last breath you
[1:00:55] don't go A Million Miles Away he says
[1:00:57] you simply change dimensions and what
[1:01:01] you were here you are
[1:01:03] there hello and so we meet him in that
[1:01:07] other dimension in the air so he's not
[1:01:10] he's coming back as a physical coming
[1:01:13] but what you Misses is the return of
[1:01:15] Christ comes in three
[1:01:18] phases that Jesus is the word how many
[1:01:21] believe that Jesus is his own word so as
[1:01:25] I said before you can't say you love
[1:01:28] Jesus if you don't love his word you
[1:01:31] love an idea you love the imagination
[1:01:34] Jesus that you've been taught or you're
[1:01:36] theorized in your mind and you think he
[1:01:38] just loves everybody doesn't matter
[1:01:40] weeks it at any kind of sin he's just
[1:01:42] grateful and you know that great ad that
[1:01:44] they' put out during the Super Bowl
[1:01:46] called he gets us and he shows all kinds
[1:01:48] of transgender homosexuals and then the
[1:01:51] line is Jesus he gets us oh and so it's
[1:01:55] this m ized hybridized version of Jesus
[1:02:00] that brings temporary salvation it bring
[1:02:02] in other words it brings some type of
[1:02:05] temporary relief of the conscience but
[1:02:07] it doesn't save the soul because the
[1:02:10] only thing that cleanses is the blood
[1:02:12] and the only way to get the blood is the
[1:02:14] light and the only way to get the light
[1:02:16] is to come under the light for your
[1:02:20] age and and I I just want to take a
[1:02:22] moment here how many moments do I have
[1:02:24] Siri I have 10 more moments it's 10 more
[1:02:26] minutes are you still with me here this
[1:02:28] morning because notice this here this is
[1:02:31] the fear this is the this is the risk I
[1:02:33] didn't have time to put these up but I
[1:02:35] just want to take a moment to insert
[1:02:36] this and we'll come back to what we
[1:02:38] heard with Gemini and Google I I want to
[1:02:40] come back to that here in a moment but I
[1:02:42] want to show you the danger because as I
[1:02:44] said how you view him will determine
[1:02:48] what you get out of him and so how much
[1:02:51] confidence let me make it more simple
[1:02:53] how much confidence you have in the word
[1:02:58] that comes through the vessel yeah amen
[1:03:03] can actually limit what you receive from
[1:03:07] the
[1:03:09] word let me make it very plain if you
[1:03:11] believe this is just a historic book and
[1:03:14] you just open it up and I'm doing my
[1:03:15] daily devotions that's good to do I'm
[1:03:17] just doing my duty as a Christian and I
[1:03:19] and I'm reading just reading good
[1:03:20] Proverbs and good lessons you'll get
[1:03:22] some good things out of it but when you
[1:03:24] view this as a living
[1:03:27] organism hello when you view this as a
[1:03:31] living person that God can speak through
[1:03:34] this the Bible becomes a whole brand new
[1:03:37] book
[1:03:39] hello and so if you see this as just a
[1:03:42] book well let me go further if you see
[1:03:45] it as just a man notice what brother
[1:03:48] Brandon was told by the angel of the
[1:03:50] Lord if you can get the people to
[1:03:54] believe amen I'll try that again if you
[1:03:57] can get the people to
[1:03:59] believe you then nothing will stand in
[1:04:04] the way of your prayers not even cancer
[1:04:07] amen you imagine as brother Brandon the
[1:04:09] pressure he was under as he came out
[1:04:11] seeing an angel of the Lord talking to
[1:04:13] the angel of the Lord yet nobody in this
[1:04:15] audience had seen him felt him talked to
[1:04:17] him and now his job is to bring the
[1:04:20] people's Faith who are down here and
[1:04:21] he's up here up to where he's
[1:04:24] at and then when he can get them people
[1:04:26] to believe this isn't just William
[1:04:28] brandom this is God Christ impersonated
[1:04:31] in his flesh in his word In the Flesh of
[1:04:33] a man then all things are possible to
[1:04:36] them that believe hlj and so notice this
[1:04:39] here if you can get the people to
[1:04:40] believe so do you see if you question it
[1:04:43] let me say it this way if you question
[1:04:46] it if you approach it from a skeptical
[1:04:49] view you can get some good out of it but
[1:04:51] it can never truly help you amen
[1:04:55] if you approach it from a critic's
[1:04:57] perspective if you question any part of
[1:05:01] it instead of accepting it as thus saith
[1:05:05] the
[1:05:06] Lord then you don't receive its benefits
[1:05:11] amen I know we we talk a lot about this
[1:05:13] about the danger of mixing or the danger
[1:05:17] of watering it down let me read you what
[1:05:19] watering it down means what does it mean
[1:05:21] to water down I'm reading this right
[1:05:23] from Cambridge Dictionary notice to
[1:05:26] intentionally make an
[1:05:29] idea a proposal or an opinion less
[1:05:34] extreme or forceful usually so that
[1:05:39] other people will accept
[1:05:42] it think of watering it down now to
[1:05:45] water down the word is to intentionally
[1:05:48] take the word and make it less extreme
[1:05:51] or forceful or absolute usually so that
[1:05:55] others will just accept it so that's
[1:06:00] what people do they water it down so
[1:06:02] that others will accept it we remove all
[1:06:05] of the parts we don't understand and
[1:06:07] only keep the parts that make perfect
[1:06:09] sense to our rationale right amen hello
[1:06:12] amen you could call this dressing it up
[1:06:15] doctoring it up make it more palpable
[1:06:17] you know it's not you know let me just
[1:06:19] say it this
[1:06:20] way this message is not for everyone
[1:06:25] amen it's not for everyone so don't try
[1:06:28] to force it on
[1:06:29] everyone a Believer an eagle sees
[1:06:33] it and and and I'll say in the words of
[1:06:36] my dad who I I love the way he said it
[1:06:38] so much he said he said if you can't see
[1:06:40] it you can't see
[1:06:42] it but if you see it it's all you
[1:06:45] [Applause]
[1:06:47] see if you catch it it's just all you
[1:06:49] see it's everything you
[1:06:51] see and so what does it mean we dilute
[1:06:54] it I looked up this word from the
[1:06:56] dictionary dilute to dilute it means to
[1:06:59] make it's make a liquid thinner or
[1:07:03] weaker by adding water or another
[1:07:06] solvent to it bleach can be diluted with
[1:07:09] cold water but you know what the problem
[1:07:10] is when you delete
[1:07:12] bleach it loses its bleach Powers amen
[1:07:16] and let me say we've received a word
[1:07:18] that has the power of
[1:07:20] bleach and it annihilates it doesn't
[1:07:22] just cover your sins it annihilates them
[1:07:25] as if you never did it in the first
[1:07:28] place you see why I want to say Lord I
[1:07:30] don't want to mix it with my idea I
[1:07:33] don't want to mix it with my opinion I
[1:07:35] don't want to look at it skeptically or
[1:07:36] I don't under even if I don't understand
[1:07:38] it listen friends I don't understand all
[1:07:40] of this message but I believe every word
[1:07:43] God's Prophet spoke because it's the
[1:07:46] power of God as Paul said un
[1:07:48] salvation to dilute it means to make it
[1:07:51] thin by adding something to it to make
[1:07:53] it thinner or weaker
[1:07:56] and so what would God do what was God
[1:07:58] going to do he would make God sent men
[1:08:00] God called men not Seminary train Not
[1:08:03] educated by theology but God sent men
[1:08:06] who could take the anointing of the
[1:08:08] seventh angel and could preach the very
[1:08:10] Zoey Seed Life do you realize when the
[1:08:14] preaching of the word is if it's not
[1:08:15] mixed with ideas and opinions it is the
[1:08:18] Zoey Seed Life Of God being sprinkled
[1:08:22] over the
[1:08:23] people and so God God sent Holy Ghost
[1:08:26] filled men with that zoy seed word and
[1:08:30] let me say the preaching of the word of
[1:08:32] God that we preach if we preach the true
[1:08:34] message that was sin and don't mix it
[1:08:36] with our opinion but is a spiritual unic
[1:08:39] in other words no seed no opinion no
[1:08:42] idea no soapbox come on somebody no
[1:08:45] bothersome no irritations but we just
[1:08:48] preach it the way a prophet preached it
[1:08:50] in its purest form I say that if you
[1:08:52] preach it that way the same power and
[1:08:55] the same anointing and the same results
[1:08:58] will come upon
[1:09:01] it and so here's what happens I I want
[1:09:04] to get to this
[1:09:07] here brother bam says this in the
[1:09:09] identified Christ I'm sorry revealed in
[1:09:11] his own word put that back up if you
[1:09:13] could that PowerPoint now it's in the
[1:09:15] head time notice the light you go back
[1:09:19] can't see with your hands you see but it
[1:09:21] was that pit notice read the last part
[1:09:23] there you can't see with the lips though
[1:09:25] it speaks but it was that Pentecostal
[1:09:29] age and so what was that dawning of that
[1:09:32] Pentecostal 1906 of zza street they
[1:09:35] begin to speak in other why did God use
[1:09:37] the tongue because the restoration had
[1:09:39] came all the way up through the feet and
[1:09:41] now it was overflowing out of the mouth
[1:09:45] amen amen right you fill up a vessel
[1:09:49] enough what does it do it eventually
[1:09:51] starts bubbling
[1:09:53] over and so they got so full with the
[1:09:55] fullness of God that they just they just
[1:09:57] they they they they begin to overflow
[1:10:00] yeah and the spirit of God as the spirit
[1:10:02] gave them utterance they spoke in other
[1:10:04] languages and other tongues because God
[1:10:07] was moving closer and closer to his body
[1:10:10] notice it was that Pentecostal age but
[1:10:13] now it's in the eye time yeah so it
[1:10:17] moves from the
[1:10:18] mouth and then it goes to the eyes see
[1:10:21] seeing now there isn't one moving
[1:10:26] faculty beyond the eye how many would
[1:10:28] agree with the
[1:10:29] prophet there's not no more hands moving
[1:10:32] no more feet moving no more mouth
[1:10:33] speaking all of those things have to
[1:10:36] either let me point that out you don't
[1:10:37] just move from the from the hands to the
[1:10:40] mouth and say oh I can cut my hands off
[1:10:43] no you still need them you don't move to
[1:10:46] the eyes and say no I don't need to
[1:10:47] speak anymore no it's not in the mouth
[1:10:49] no as brother bandam says and countdown
[1:10:51] each one of those Restorations the
[1:10:53] automobile listen just cuz we have a
[1:10:55] spaceship doesn't mean we don't need
[1:10:58] automobiles hello just cuz I got an
[1:11:00] airplane doesn't nothing doesn't mean I
[1:11:02] don't need my Toyota I still need it I
[1:11:04] don't travel Everywhere by plane so you
[1:11:07] don't do away with one of them it builds
[1:11:10] upon the next Hallelujah you don't do
[1:11:14] away with gifts but this isn't just a
[1:11:17] gift this is the
[1:11:20] person so he says there's not one moving
[1:11:22] faculty beyond the eye notice what is
[1:11:24] after the eye the next is the
[1:11:30] intelligence which is what I want you to
[1:11:33] catch this because I pointed this last
[1:11:35] time brother bam in the message
[1:11:37] countdown he preaches it multiple times
[1:11:39] and he shows us that as man in science
[1:11:43] would accomplish or discover he said it
[1:11:46] was only a reflection of where God was
[1:11:50] at invisibly in his Plan of Redemption
[1:11:54] so when they discovered automobile God
[1:11:57] was doing something when they discovered
[1:11:59] flight and brother bandam says about the
[1:12:01] time they were getting off the ground
[1:12:02] the right Brothers there was a little
[1:12:04] group in in California on a little
[1:12:07] street called isua in a little dingy
[1:12:08] dark dirty h brother B said a place no
[1:12:10] one would have ever visited and at the
[1:12:12] same time they're getting off the ground
[1:12:14] there's some Believers beginning to
[1:12:15] speak out of their mouth amen amen and
[1:12:18] so the brother brandom says but watch as
[1:12:20] Discovery scientific discovery always
[1:12:22] follows it what is after the vision what
[1:12:24] is after the the eyes of prophetic
[1:12:27] Vision the next is the intelligence
[1:12:29] which is Christ somebody say this with
[1:12:32] me
[1:12:33] it's to do what who controls the whole
[1:12:38] body amen see down through the age we
[1:12:42] started off from the foundation I got
[1:12:44] two seconds we started off from the
[1:12:49] foundation from the first church age
[1:12:52] when the seed went in the ground the
[1:12:54] complete seed now he showing you the
[1:12:55] whole process then it come through the
[1:12:57] feet Luther come back out then through
[1:13:00] Wesley then into Pentecostals the
[1:13:02] tongues and the lips see now it's in the
[1:13:05] eyes prophetic of Malachi 4 amen now
[1:13:10] don't do what so many have done and in
[1:13:13] the quote with the prophetic Malachi 4
[1:13:16] cuz he wasn't
[1:13:18] done and now there's nothing else left
[1:13:23] for it to come but I love this
[1:13:27] him
[1:13:29] himself to step into
[1:13:34] that what did he do with mzc brother bam
[1:13:37] said he just took some dust and he
[1:13:38] stepped into a body he wrapped himself
[1:13:41] in Mary brother mam says he took that
[1:13:42] blood cell and wrapped himself the word
[1:13:45] made flesh what was it it wasn't Mary it
[1:13:47] wasn't it wasn't the seed of a man it
[1:13:49] wasn't the egg of a woman it was God
[1:13:52] himself it was Emmanuel God With us amen
[1:13:57] and so if he came into a body what's he
[1:13:58] wanting to do now he's wanting to step
[1:14:01] back into his body and I say Lord let me
[1:14:03] be available to you let my vessel how
[1:14:07] many want to say that today make my let
[1:14:09] me make myself available for that
[1:14:13] intelligence to come down to step into
[1:14:17] that's the last thing there is the next
[1:14:22] is the
[1:14:23] intelligence we we have no intelligence
[1:14:26] musicians could you come of our own we
[1:14:28] have no sight of our own he How could a
[1:14:31] man foresee those things he can't do it
[1:14:33] it's God himself see it's becoming to a
[1:14:35] place and he's governed the body all the
[1:14:38] way through then the complete body of
[1:14:40] Christ is revealed in the form of a
[1:14:43] bride that was taken out of his side
[1:14:45] like Adam did at the beginning like
[1:14:46] Adams was rather at the beginning the
[1:14:49] next is the
[1:14:53] intelligent the next
[1:14:55] God said if you can stand with me to
[1:14:57] your
[1:14:58] feet brother bam says the next thing was
[1:15:02] for him to step into a body came all the
[1:15:05] way down through the hands through the
[1:15:06] feet Through The Eyes through the mouth
[1:15:09] Through The Eyes prophetic vision and
[1:15:11] now what do we see my brother my sister
[1:15:13] what I displayed to you was complete
[1:15:15] artificial intelligence what is it it's
[1:15:18] a changing of the beat it's a changing
[1:15:21] of the sympathy listen these things are
[1:15:23] not accident it's not just AC I'm not
[1:15:25] just I'm not picking on
[1:15:27] technology I I I you you brother mat you
[1:15:29] against artificial intelligence no I'm
[1:15:31] not against my vehicle either or an
[1:15:33] airplane
[1:15:35] either but it's simply showing us where
[1:15:38] we are the next thing is the
[1:15:43] intelligence to where brother bandam
[1:15:45] says that what is it it's as The
[1:15:47] Headstone the head the
[1:15:49] headship as The Headstone nears the body
[1:15:54] you remember this quot
[1:15:56] as The Headstone nears the body those in
[1:16:00] the bride will be so much like Jesus Oh
[1:16:05] I raised my hand and say Yes
[1:16:08] Lord they will be so much like Jesus how
[1:16:12] many want that
[1:16:14] today till they will be in his very
[1:16:18] image to where God Christ is
[1:16:23] impersonated
[1:16:25] in his
[1:16:26] word Christ impersonated in his word
[1:16:30] every head
[1:16:32] [Music]
[1:16:33] bowed Christ you say what what part of
[1:16:37] him brother Matt all of
[1:16:40] him his
[1:16:42] nature his
[1:16:45] word his Doctrine you say Doctrine is
[1:16:47] important Doctrine it's what you believe
[1:16:50] my brother my sister is so important it
[1:16:53] will determine how you live and how you
[1:16:55] live will determine where you go
[1:16:57] eternally false Doctrine is one of the
[1:17:00] greatest threats to the True Church of
[1:17:03] Christ a it's not just some false
[1:17:05] Doctrine as brother bam said he doesn't
[1:17:07] come with something way out in the left
[1:17:08] field but false Doctrine is any SE of
[1:17:11] discrepancy any
[1:17:12] hybridizing of the word of God any
[1:17:16] opinion mixed in it any idea I wonder if
[1:17:19] we could just do a heart scan today and
[1:17:21] say Lord search me if I've added
[1:17:24] anything into this word if I've added
[1:17:26] any of my thoughts then purge them God I
[1:17:29] raised my hand and say Purge me Lord
[1:17:31] Jesus Purge my mind Purge my spirit if
[1:17:34] any of my doubts there Purge it Lord God

[1:17:40] full of life I want to be full of the
[1:17:42] Holy Ghost how many want it today I
[1:17:44] don't want there to be any seat of
[1:17:46] discrepancy any
[1:17:48] mixture of anything Lord that would take
[1:17:50] away the effect of the token for this
[1:17:52] age let me accept it let me believe Lord
[1:17:56] that when you sent up when you sent
[1:17:58] those seven angels on Mount Sunset what
[1:18:01] was it it was the headship coming back
[1:18:03] to the body it's not for us to question
[1:18:06] it's not for us to guess at or wonder at
[1:18:09] it's for us to say Lord I submit to the
[1:18:11] headship of the word I submit as a man
[1:18:14] how many men can do it I submit as a
[1:18:16] woman how many sisters can do it as a
