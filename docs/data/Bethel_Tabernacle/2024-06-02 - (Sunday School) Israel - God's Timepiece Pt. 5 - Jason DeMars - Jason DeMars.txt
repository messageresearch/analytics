========================================

e e e e e e e e e e morning everyone let's stand school speak on uh Israel God's time piece part five and start with our opening scripture in Hosea for the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king and without a prince and without a sacrifice and without an image and without without an ephod and without a teraphim afterward shall the children of Israel return and seek the Lord their God and David their King and shall fear the lord and his goodness in the latter days amen Heavenly Father we come before you Lord and we ask that your presence be with us we ask that you would speak to us and teach us out of your word Lord what uh what incredible hour we're living in to see the the closing scenes Lord of you dealing with the Gentiles and things closing up and such rampant apostasy from almost start to finish amongst the uh the major Orthodox and Protestant churches Lord and yet there's an overcomer in this age it's it's not it's not for us to despair but to Hope knowing that if you ordained an overcomer you ordained a means for us to enter into that overcoming power because it's salvation is not from us it's from you Lord and as we look this hour approaching we know that you're just about to turn and begin to deal with Israel again Lord You've brought them back uh as a nation uh given them their own Sovereign Nation and through troublous times Lord You've restored them and yet here they are still in unbelief and blindness father I pray that you'd open their eyes and open their understanding Lord to the revelation of who you are in in the in the Lord Jesus Christ we commit Our Time Lord to you and ask that You' take your word and write it on our hearts in Jesus name amen God bless you you can be seated so last time um I didn't want to go back over it because it would get me it would get me stuck but last time we were looking in Romans 11 and we went through I believe Romans 9 10 and 11 and it took us part 2 three and four to go through those and I just want to uh quickly at the beginning of this review the main points of what Paul wrote within that and then kind of move forward to look at Israel's restoration and sort of the conditions and what what the scripture says um will happen and which all portions have already happened but the fullness has not come to pass yet so looking at Romans 9:10 11 Paul is making these 10 points in order for God to bring Gentiles to Salvation he had to Blind the Jews amen two the Gentiles reive The Promise by faith wherein the Jews sought to receive them by works God has turned to the Gentiles to provoke the Jews to jealousy but an elected remnant of the Jews will be saved God has not five God has not Cast Away His People Israel six the elect in Israel received the promise but the rest were blinded by God Seven there is a casting away of Israel but there will also be a receiving of Israel eight the receiving of Israel will produce a resurrection nine blindness has happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles become in 10 but when the final predestinated seed comes into the Gentiles then God turns to deal with Israel and brings them salvation amen and so as we move forward we understand that it's it's an impossibility to take these scriptures and do as many in the church history and even today post millennialist will say that the church replaces Israel it reduces the words of Paul to Goble and nonsense why is he if he's talking about Gentiles and Israel and re restoration and blindness but but Israel is simply replaced by the church uh it becomes nonsense amen you know it's it's taking what you do what you do is take one scripture and then you reinterpret the rest of the Bible and this is what we call misplacing misinterpreting doing all the things you're not supposed to do not all Israel is Israel that's true and it's not all Israel is the one that's circumcised in the flesh but circumcised in the spirit so Paul says we are the true Israel nevertheless he continues to speak of Israel as a nation continues to speak of them as blindness in in blindness what what Ephesians 2 and really I should cover that in this but Ephesians 2 shows us clearly that the covenants of Promise Gentiles were foreigners and strangers to them now we're brought near by the blood of Christ so now we have access to the same promises but again this doesn't invalidate God's promise to restore Israel because the purpose here he's saying is that Gentiles were grafted in because of their unbelief and the Jews will be grafted back in because of the Gentiles unbelief and so let's start to look we started in Hosea chapter 3 veres 4 and 5 we know Hosea was a great type of Jehovah god with his bride who was a prostitute who was forsaken uh who forsook Hosea ran away from him and The Story Goes and you're you know that that he continued to go after her and bring her his purpose was to bring her back and so that that whole picture is a type of Israel is they Unfaithful they rejected what God had done amongst them through the Lord Jesus Christ they played the The Prostitute but God's love never changes he went after them even in even in their prostitution and rejection of him and their blasphemy of the Lord Jesus Christ he went after them amen all right so here we see the Bible tells us that Israel will not have a king will not have a prince will go without sacrifice so without a king without a prince undoubtedly we understand that that happened when Babylon when they came and took them away right they were without a King Without a prince but the temple was rebuilt when when they were returned the temple was rebuilt but they never got back a king or a prince they were always a vassal Nation underneath the power of the Gentiles right but they had a sacrifice and so forth they had they had their their uh levitical priesthood and religion so this is not talking about that time but this is talking about a future time which we're still in the middle of right now they're without a king they have they have a president they have a government but they don't have the the the lineage of David restored to the throne yet and they're without sacrifice etc etc all right afterward shall the children of Israel return and seek the Lord their God and David their King and shall fear the lord and his goodness in the latter days well the Lord has brought them back it's the L it's the latter days he's brought them back to the nation to the to the area to the land and he's going to cause them to seek the Lord their God up to this point they've remained in what they're still in blindness let's not forget that we love Israel as a nation we love that they're God's chosen people but don't forget that they're in blindness and Disobedience they don't know who God is they have they have a Zeal for who they think is God but remember when they were when Jesus was on the earth he told them you don't you don't know me nor do you know my father so the what and he says this is the one you claim to worship so what what they claim and what they actually are possessors of it's two different things they're claiming to know God but they don't know him amen because they haven't seen who the Lord Jesus Christ is all right so but but they he's returned them but the second part they haven't done yet first they're going to have to what first he returns them but they're going to have to start seeking the Lord their God and David their King they haven't sought after David their King in fact if you look look if you look closely and examine closely you'll you'll see that there's a great fear amongst the politicians about rebuilding the temple they they don't want they don't the polit political class doesn't want to do that they they they they fear the ramifications of it all right let's keep going Luke 21 so they're without a king they're without their land and Luke 21 starting at verse 20 Jesus prophesying and when you shall see Jerusalem compass with armies then know that the Desolation thereof is nigh this happened in the late 60s into 70 AD then let them which are in Judea flee to the mountains and let them which are in the midst of it depart out and let not them that are in the countries enter there into for these be the days of Vengeance that all things which are written may be fulfilled but woe unto them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days for there shall be great distress in the land and wrath upon this people and they shall fall by the edge of the sword and shall be led away captive into all nations and Jerusalem Jerusalem shall be trotten down of the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled amen so 70 AD they were LED away captive by the Roman army spread throughout the Nations and Jerusalem has been trotten down and in in the late 1960s Israel an Israeli Army marched in to what was Jordanian territory and took over Jerusalem so now it's under the government and and the authority of Israel and yet still they submit to the abomination of desolation the Dome of the Rock standing on the place of the of the Holy place so we know that this is a process just like the coming of the Lord second coming of the Lord is a process starting in spirit form with him descending from heaven with a message and coming in Bride form we know that this is also a process as well that the time of Jerusalem being trotten down of the even though Israel has ultimate Authority they haven't taken ultimate Authority the the Muslims still have uh have have a governing authority over the the mosque and the Dome of the Rock but once that once that happens once that is done the times of the Gentiles are over that will usher in the millennium so we're in the process of them being restored to have their King and have their nation and have their Temple so forth we read this I think in part one want to read it again Isaiah 11 11 and 12 and it shall come to pass in that day that the Lord shall set his hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his people which shall be left from Assyria and from Egypt and from Pathos and from Kush and from ilam and from shinar and from HTH and from the islands of the sea and he shall set up an end sign for the Nations and shall assemble the outcasts of Israel and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth so again this is the second time he recovers them the first time he recovered them was when they went back to receive the coming of the Messiah so the second time where he comes sets his hand again to recover them that's what happened starting with well really it started happening in the early 1900s even in the late 1800s it be Jews began to move back to Israel and of course their their nationhood was believe 1948 that they were declared a nation Ezekiel 36 24 and 25 for I will take you from among the Heathen and gather you out of all countries and will bring you into your own land then will I sprinkle clean water upon you and you shall be clean from all your filthiness and from all your Idols will I cleanse you so uh again people will take this and say well this is Ezekiel Ezekiel is prophesying during the time of the cap Babylonian captivity this is just talking about when they came back from the B Babylonian captivity we'll go on to read to see the absurdity of this but I want to comment on it as you look you go and read and study Ezekiel 36-44 and you'll see the absurdity of of that number one is Ezekiel 38 and 39 is showing a an alliance between Russia turkey Iran Libya Somalia Etc these nations gathering together in an alliance to come and attack Israel when has that happened in history did that happen before they were returned or right after they were returned it's never happened in fact those countries have never had an alliance until the last few years now you see those countries aligning with one another so we know then that Ezekiel 36 is not speaking about returning from the Babylonian captivity this was a future from ezekiel's time a future returning from the Captivity it's talking about our day and our time right now so he takes them from from among the Heathen from all the countries so he brings them first back to their land then he says I'll sprinkle clean water upon you and you shall be clean from all your filthiness so when they were out of the land what were they they were in filthiness they were in idolatry is what it's saying you say they are in idolatry yep how can you say that they wor they say they worship Jehovah god well I'll just say it this postc Temple Judaism talmudic Judaism is no different than idolatry why because they refuse the manifested Messiah when you as soon as you refuse the manifested Messiah no matter what you claim to worship it's idolatry you're not worshiping the true and living God you're walking in evil and filthiness and that's the that's the reality we love the Jewish people we know that God has a promise for them but they are now living under idolatry that's the scripture amen and so what does this tell us this tells us that when Israel is is returned to the land they're not repenting before they get back to the land they are repenting after they get back to the land so first he restores them while in unbelief and idolatry and false Doctrine that's where they're still at Israel is still in that position of filthiness they need to be sprinkled and washed clean and restored from their idolatry further it goes Ezekiel 36:26 a new heart also will I give you and a new spirit will I put within you and I will take away the Stony heart out of your flesh and I will give you an heart of Flesh and I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and you shall keep my judgments and do them so again they're restored in a condition of unbelief back to the land now of course we you say man I thought that was a that scripture applies to us I want you to I want you to understand something it certainly does applied to us this scripture here brother Brandon preaches on it many uh many people have taught on it and shown how the new birth comes and sanctification justification but I want you to also understand within the context of scripture many times we'll see this also in Ezekiel that there's a there's a multiple two-fold application of scripture one if you take this absolutely literally in its its Condition it's it's speaking of Israel and God's plan for Israel but then it also has a a second application which is also to Believers as individuals you'll find that in Zechariah 14 where it says at the evening time very famous scripture as message Believers that we hear all the time about the evening time it shall be light this is right in the middle of a scripture that's speaking about the Trib Great Tribulation and God's purpose for Israel and you'll find that again and again Paul when when when speaking about about preaching of the Gospel throughout all the world he takes the scripture that says the heavens declare the glory of the Lord in the firmament his handiwork their line has gone into all the Earth and Paul applies that to himself and preachers of the Gospel I thought it was the heavens that declare the glory of God and the Paul says no it's we do we're the ones that are doing it well it's both true and that's what that that's what we find over and over again that scripture has multiple fulfillments and and multiple uh applications now it's not for us to come up with a thousand different ways to interpret the scripture that's a lot of crazy people have brought a lot of crazy false Doctrine by misapplying that when I say that the messenger of the age should be the one that shows us that Paul Tau taught us that brother brandham taught us that and showed us that that it has multiple fulfillments and he gives us the explanation if if if you take this idea and extrapolate it you'll wind up far in the ditch so I just want to say that uh before I go on from here so again Israel restored in unbelief filthiness idolatry back brought back to the land when they're brought back to the land if you remember brother bham says over over and over again a Jew can never be blessed until he's back in the land soon as he leaves the land he's leaving the place of Promise so God has to in unbelief restore them back to the land and bring forth his Pro promises to to bring them salvation verse 28 and you shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers and you shall be my people and I will be your God next chapter Ezekiel 37 the hand of the Lord was upon me and carried me out in the spirit of the Lord and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of Bones and caused me to pass by them round about and behold there were very many in the open Valley and lo they were very dry I want you to see this verse is it speaking about a physical Resurrection in some ways it is but I I think you need to see it more as God's the condition of Israel God's purpose for Israel what is the condition of Israel dead bones Dry Bones of course again another thing multiple applications but that's the condition of Israel both spiritually and politically in in their as a as a nation as a people and in their relationship with God he brought them to that Valley which was full of Bones and caused me to pass by them round about behold there were many in very many in the open Valley and lo they were very dry and he said unto me son of man can these bone Li these bones live and I answered oh Lord God thou knowest again he said unto me prophesy unto these bones and say unto them oh ye Dry Bones hear ye the word of the Lord thus sayith the Lord God unto these bones behold I will cause breath to enter into you and you shall live and I will lay Senus upon you and will bring up flesh upon you and cover you a skin and put breath in you and you shall live and you shall know that I am the Lord so I prophesied as I was commanded and as I prophesied there was a noise and behold a shaking and Bones came together bone to his bone and when I beheld low the Senus of the flesh came up upon them and the skin covered them above but there was no breath in them then said he unto me prophesy un the wind prophesy son of man and say to the wind thus sayith the Lord God come from the Four Winds o breath and breathe upon these slain that they may live all right so we see we see there there's four winds and the Four Winds are going to breathe upon Israel that they might live again context is important Ezekiel 38 37 30 or 3 I can count I promise 36 37 38 39 all the way to the end to 44 this is speaking about the restoration of Israel and the purpose that God has for them so this is not changing the subject abruptly this is uh a a vivid illustration of what God is going to do this nation who is dead amongst amongst the world in and bring them Total Restoration not just physical but they'll be completely restored with the Breath of God blown upon them just as we saw in the previous chapter that he's going to give them them a new spirit a new heart and put his Spirit within them let's look at some other scriptures Isaiah 43:5 fear not for I am with thee I will bring thy seed from the East and gather thee from the West I will say to the north give up and to the South keep not back bring my sons from far and my daughters from the ends of the Earth amen so this is God saying I'm going to gather Israel back to the land that I have promised them Jeremiah 16:14 therefore behold the days come sayeth the Lord that it shall no more be said the Lord liveth that brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt but the Lord liveth that brought up the children of Israel from the land of the north and from all the lands with he driven them and I will bring them again to their land that I gave unto their fathers behold I will send for many Fishers sayeth the Lord and they shall fish them and after will I send for many hunters and they shall hunt them from Every Mountain and from every Hill and out of the holes of the rock a great persecution began to take place in the late 1930s am and again what ended up happening was you had these uh important banking families I'm trying to speak about the conditions that led to this they had these important Jewish banking families that controlled the finances and if you remember after World War I America and and the Allies put a horrible uh sanction on the German Nation and this caused the collapse of everything and and the collapse of their society and so the German people looked and saw the bankers the banking families CU remember for much of the Middle Ages Jews couldn't couldn't learn the trades unless they converted to Catholicism so the only trade they could do was in jewels and finance and so they became because of that they weathered the storm of what happened and they were financially well to do while the German people perished so this led to the conspiracy that all Jews are evil and they must be exterminated from the face of the Earth so throughout Europe this took place and while this Spirit was released upon that Europe the European nations it was also released in the Middle East and what was it it was they were hunting and fishing thinking I'm killing Jews but it was God allowing them demons to do what they want to do and he was going to pull the last trick on them but out of this great evil he was going to bring his people back to the land and you see all the nations uh of those of the Middle East that we read about before that he was going to call them from those Nations and from the north east south west everywhere is that all these nations begin to vomit up the Jews to kill them but to give them no place to go at the end and to put within them that further desire see Zionism and the desire to go back to Israel there was an anointing that came when the leoan church age came suddenly the Jewish people wanted to go back and many even of those banking families were financing and funding one of the cities that I like to go to and stay in in Israel was is uh is was started by Jacob Rothchild and so these families were sending money they're atheists they they they've done so many atrocities these are horrible banking families that brought such a Scourge on the earth it controlled so many things but yet God used them in order to bring his purpose about to have his children his sons and daughters sent back to the land that he had promised them and so these hunters and Fishers came and did that and well we're not going to get to it this morning but you'll see that God says there's going to be a great purging of Israel there's a purging that happened to bring them back to the land but then there's a purging that further happens in the Great Tribulation period or the time of Jacob's trouble and we'll in in future uh Sunday schools will go more into detail about that and God's purpose and plan and how he works during that Great Tribulation period so let's let's let's stand and we'll pray Heavenly Father we just come to you Lord and we're so thankful for your goodness and mercy to us Lord we ask that your Holy Spirit would be with us Lord as we worship and as we go to the word today Lord may you be magnified and glorified in our midst Lord May the sick be healed may may Hearts be mended Lord and may Souls be saved and and transformed by the power of the word we ask in the name of Jesus Christ amen God bless you [Music] [Music] oh
