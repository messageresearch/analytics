========================================

we'll just read verse seven got me brothers doesn't sound like a moan here yeah alright amen I'd like to speak to you here this morning and teach on this subject that I the Lord put upon my heart for the brothers yesterday in the breakfast and so we're gonna this carry that and this morning do a little bit more teaching on it you could go in and display that brother Joe that title slide I would like to speak to you on vexed by Sodom and subtitled this clean in a dirty aged second Peter chapter two let's just begin reading here at verse five speaking of Noah spared not the old world but saved Noah the eighth person a preacher of righteousness bringing in the flood brothers you might want to check the headphones for the Matthew because I don't think I'm on here so you might want to turn me on here I it's not on it all up here so let's continue here verse 6 turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes condemned them with an overthrow making them an example unto those that after should live ungodly notice this verse 7 this is where we want to draw our inferences emphasis here and deliver just lot vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked for that righteous man dwelling among them and seeing and hearing vexed his righteous soul there we go now we got power vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds you can be seated this morning Luke chapter 17 turned there in your Bible with me but Joe you got that PowerPoint so we'd like to have that up we're going to use that here just right away as soon as we can get it Luke chapter 17 is a very familiar scripture to us and I just want to draw some emphasis from it today and particularly verse 30 but let's start here at verse 28 it says likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they they sold they planted they builded but the same day that lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be and the day when the Son of Man is revealed and we know that that's the day and age that you and I are living in and I believe that it's very just a picture perfect description of the age that you're living in today we are truly in the days of lot again and a lot of times when we think of lot we think the days of Sodom we think of Sodom we think of homosexuality and that's that's a significance there for sure but really Sodom was a a city that was overflowing with evil it was and it was a depictive of more than just a homosexual agenda but a wicked age a wicked world Amen a wicked time to live in and the Bible says that the the the sins of Sodom were so great that God's wrath poured out upon Sodom and he destroyed it by fire and brimstone and so you know I think there's there's a lot that could be said here today we wanted this teach on this just here for a moment particularly slot but we know that the Bible calls lot a righteous man I'm gonna need that PowerPoint brothers as soon as you can display it we're gonna need it I don't know if this is on maybe the screens not on but we know that the Bible calls lot a just man you can see it here in 2nd Peter I want you to keep your Bible especially since they don't have it there on the screen yet this bring up 2nd Peter chapter 2 and keep your place there it's amazing because what's clear when you think of the world that you live in today is the world is falling apart and I believe that that is a statement that brother Jason Amar's made that's meant so much to to us and we've repeated it many times is that you're living in a diseased world and you know when brother Jason said that he said you're living in a diseased world you've got to remember you're walking and living working learning amongst diseased people now we know that that disease are talking about is a sin disease and so your children go to school amongst in a diseased atmosphere where a education system has shifted and turned their backs on God and teaches especially in the public school curriculum teaches against God and and gives a very secular psychology to children and so it's a world that's falling apart very much like Sodom was falling apart we could say today this world's falling apart no question and so the generation that we live in is becoming vile and more vile by the day and I think that it's a it's a it's a world that's losing their faith in God as we just pointed out God has been put pushed out put out and you know we could see it here in South Carolina and let me just tell you today that you're living and what's known as the Bible Belt you're living in a conservative state with a conservative governor you know and and even with that you know Buford being a democratic City but even with that we can see you imagine if we here can see the effects of a demonic agenda how much more they could see it in other places in the world you go to California or you go to Colorado you go to places that lean really hard left and and I'm not getting them pointed out any political you know given any political credit here to one party both of them were corrupt and they're not the answer and they've tried to give the answer and they they've thought it would it would be placed in a man or a party and they've realized that's failed and the world is is losing their faith in God honestly you're let's say faithless generation and people may have hold on to cling to religion and hold on to religion because of tradition but really the they've lost their faith in the Word of God because the Word of God is regarded today the Bible even as a infallible book that's the source of all life it's regarded as just religion and when you have that you get a world that's faithless Bible says faith cometh by hearing hearing of the word of God so if you're not hearing the Word of God how can you expect to have faith that's how faith comes so we have this title here today and the remote here let me just turn it on we have this title vexed by Sodom and then I've subtitled this clean in a dirty age and I'd like to look at what it means here to be clean amongst a dirty age and I think that the question could be asked you know as we just go through this as has two brothers yesterday it's sort of a rhetorical question but is it even possible to be clean in such a wicked world is it possible to have righteousness to have a people that have zeal for the Lord in such a wicked age or you know or is it inevitable you know that the world's so dark and it's so dirty and it's so wicked that it's just you know we're just gonna have to we're gonna have to sort of slide with the world as they go down we go down with it and I think we know the answer to that question it's not only possible to live holy and clean by the power of the Holy Spirit but actually your your to be growing in holiness growing in righteousness amen and so I think when we look at here at lot what I want to just point out a few things before we begin the the the Bible uses a word here that I like to use and I'm not I guess this doesn't work with Joe so go to the next slide I forgot this one's not connected to I don't think to propresenter but the word this is second Peter to seven the scripture that we read it I want to teach on it just here for a moment in verse 7 it says and delivered just lot vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked and so we look at this this first go to the next slide here this no no you went too far it yep so this word here it's amazing because this is the word the Greek word that is used here when it says here and in that he delivered just lot you just read that in verse 7 he delivered just lot and so this word that we find let me find my place here in my notes this word that we find for for delivered means to draw oneself to pull oneself to rescue or to snatch up to draw or rescue a person - and for the deliverer now it's amazing because when you think about this here God is this is a in other words this is a last-ditch effort to save this individual this is what exactly what the Bible saying that God delivered he snatched him out and the picture that we had at the beginning will show you that that the angel came to lot and said he scape and come thither you know why won't you escape you want to die here in the city go back by the Jil one one one slide noted to the word just you should have a slide for the word just too too far back one more so this is what the scripture means when it says that he was just it doesn't mean just in the sense of only but it says that he was a righteous man so the Bible says that this this is what this word means in Greek it means right or judicial approval now that's important because we know the story of lot and we know how it goes that he would you know he goes into complete sin and and he you know we don't want to even get into that here today but we know the way lot we know the way that Lots life went and it would be anything other than righteous but what's important here is the Bible says he was just in other words he was judicially approved now that approval came not by lot but by his association with a important man named Abraham and so lots righteousness was attributed to him for the Association being Abraham's family we know that lot lived amongst with Abraham he sojourned with Abraham he you know I would say he worshiped with Abraham you know he's seen how Abraham worshiped and he knew that they had came out of her for a purpose what was the purpose for leaving Earth was it just to go aimlessly on a journey it was for a son that was the purpose your to lead because your seed shall be more numerable than the stars of the sky in the in the sand of the seashore and I'm gonna bless thee and through thy seed Abraham all the nations of the earth will be blessed now this was the purpose that God had in having Abraham and lot leave her so that purpose immediately as we know begins to fade from lot's mind I think that's very clear that you could see and even in lot he's a righteous man he's a just man the Bible calls him a just man I Cyro tit this way and I believe it's it can have such an important significance he's a righteous man living below what he knows is true and it starts with the desire it didn't start with a house and Sodom catch follow me here Lots story doesn't start in Sodom and no-one's story starts in Sodom and ends in Sodom and so it doesn't start there it started with Abraham it started as a what the Bible calls notice what Thayer says he's approved by God righteous just in the eyes of God so he's accounted he's judicial that's what that's what justification he's justified it's a legal status he's justified he's considered righteous in the eyes of God and so the Bible says here Peter 2:7 and God delivered just righteous righteous lot and so the Bible says that he had chosen this is remember he didn't start and sought him he started with Abraham and you say brother Matt where how did he get from Abraham dwelling with Abraham with the purpose for a promised son to living in Sodom and his life ends up at the gate of the city of Sodom the Bible is what the Bible says in Genesis says that he's sitting at the gate of Sodom now that has the significance that means he has political status when you dwell at the gate that means you're considered a man with wisdom you know just like and the you know the time gone by you'd have the you know the the older men the elder men you know together you know and there was wisdom in that and their people would come to them for counsel people would come them even the judges judicially were had to be of a certain age so you say was that significant visit its it tells you something about lot that he wasn't just a believer living in the world and is separated to himself but he had immersed himself in Sodom culture and so it's amazing here when you look at this he starts with a desire the Bible says it this way we're gonna just save some time here because we're limited for time this morning we're gonna save some time in turning I'm just gonna quote it for you paraphrasing the Bible says that lot pitched his tent toward Sodom now that that speaks of something he's with Abraham he's not in Sodom yet he's not living there doesn't have a house he's not at the gate back up rewind he starts with his tent pitched toward Sodom so he's a in other words it's speaking of his heart his affection he's longing for something you following me he's desiring for the wrong thing where is Abraham where is Abraham and LA are physically together their hearts could not be more contrary to each other Abraham had a purpose he knew his life had a purpose he knew he was in life for a reason and his reason wasn't worldly his reason was for a promise from Jehovah I hope you're catching it this morning but yet lot though he's physically with him though he's there in person yet his heart was far away from that purpose you know many times people can associate with believers physically be in church but their heart is toward sodomy we know sodomy in a type of the world type of the flesh and so he's a righteous man righteous by justification living with his heart and so lot starts there well anytime the heart turns towards something eventually the feet follow and it doesn't always happen overnight did you catch that it always starts your feet don't walk towards the world without first your heart turning to the world first and there was a long period of time that lot lived in church sat in church associated with Abraham but his heart was already looking to something else and eventually his feet follows and he says I'm gonna go dwell and so lot you think about this just in retrospect he chooses a city that is that his destiny is judgment its destiny is fire and brimstone its destiny is destruction fast-forward the movie you go to the end before the credits you have a city that's burning and on fire this was the inevitable end of Sodom now let me just bring it to today this nation has an end fast-forward to the end what a brother branham's see the last vision he said the sick that a sixth vision second-to-last he said was women in the morality the degradation of the morals of a woman he said it was a complete striptease to where she was just almost naked had nothing on now that's the words of a prophet in a vision and that wasn't true in 1965 he might have thought it was brother Branham even there and his own mind thought it was true my brother my sister we're seeing the fulfillment of that vision right here in 2020 the degradation the morality it was something of just like in the beginning and with Eve now in this last generation brother IRA preaches a message Satan's Eden and he said this is his Eden more than ever before he says he's seen the degradation of the morals not just of women that was that was that was symbolic but it was the morality the the the morals of the entire world had had to hit such a low ebb brother Brennan says then the seventh vision he said I've seen America in ruins and ashes he said just smoldering like an atomic bomb had went off so you say brother Matt what is that that's the end the inevitable destiny for this nation for this world so I ask you why would you ever choose to immerse yourself in this culture when the end is inevitable lot made a choice to associate now I know that we're in this world but we're not of this world and we don't immerse ourselves in the culture were not like the rest of the world were pilgrims were Abraham's seed pilgrims strangers lot chooses a city that's ultimate destination is destruction its judgment and he and he says this is where I'm gonna I'm gonna inhabit this place I'm gonna live her I'm gonna dwell here and so so you know this is exactly what happens is that the Bible says that it vexed his righteous soul it's 10:50 we're not gonna get anywhere near done this morning and so go to the next slide by the joke this is what this word vex means now notice this here now remember Paul's that if you could hear for a moment go back to the word deliver to brother Joe Buddhist we're not gonna speed up we're gonna slow down here from it I don't want to I'm not gonna get to where one of the goes so we're just gonna go we'll carry this on through another Sunday so this word delivered this is amazing because it as we read it already it means to be I don't know how to pronounce that Greek word but it means to be snatched it's speaking of a last-ditch effort God makes a last-ditch effort to save this man now he lives there and and you and we don't I don't know the Bible doesn't go to what degree lot became backslidden lot became lustful and sinful and sensual I don't know the Bible just says that he lives in Sodom but here's what we know he said he's a gate keeper as we said he's in a man of importance he's when the angel comes to him he's sitting at the gate of the city and so the but but God makes a last-ditch effort to save this man right before destruction I thought about that and thought you know if you're God's Eve gotta make a last-ditch effort to save you before destruction I'm glad for that kind of a mercy and it may be your own life it may be your last breath it may be your deathbed it whatever it takes God was brother branham said it this way God will get his man so Peter uses this word and he says he delivered he said he delivered him so God reaches into the sewer of Sodom and he saves pulls this man out he snatches him out Jude speaks of this and says save them and he says snatch them snatching them fresh queuing them that's the word rescue them from the fire but don't have your garments spotted with the world and so he snatches lot his family out right before judgment strikes Sodom and so it's it's lot is so spiritually his conscience is so spiritually seared you know that because the angel has to repeat it multiple times says he scape toward Luke I think it's Chapter seven says he escaped and come the angel said escape and come thither and the Bible says count yourself be ready be sober at all times it says that you may be accounted worthy to escape all these things all the judgments and stand before the Son of man it's a reference to this Luke it's a reference to lot here and and and the Son of man had revealed himself to Abraham already in the form of Melchizedek and so a lot as the Bible says the angel said escape and come thither and he's so seared angel eyes to repeat and finally to snatch him out snatch his family and even the effects of so went into his own wife his mate that she turns her back and we know the story she turns back and looks at Sodom and turns to a pillar of salt and so he he's dreary the Bible has this this way to pointed out that he's drug out of Sodom he's drug out of he was so entangled this is exactly what Sodom does Sodom a Masada this is exactly what the world does it's like a vine it just attaches itself and you're so attached you're not thinking straight and he's saying a lot come on what are you doing this God's about to destroy this city so heed this word here delivered him I want you to catch that it's to snatch up to draw or rescue a person - and for the deliverer there you know if God would not have intervened a lot would have stayed and died in this city if God had to intervene and so he he saves him he pulls him we don't want to cover that again he's now I want you to I want you to catch this here the next word there vex brother Joe look at look in your Bible a 2nd Peter chapter 2 verse 7 let's read it one more time it says and delivered just lot it's not just righteous law vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked and so so he's the Bible says he says lot was very this word vex is extremely important and we're just going to take a pulse here but it's extremely important because it's it's the Greek word and I this maybe I don't speak Greek so it may be pronounced wrong cat upon EO is the Greek word and I didn't have the lexicon I used a different one there so you actually see in the Greek it's the present passive participle it means to tire down the notice this it means to tire down so when it remember before you read this think in your mind it vexed his righteous soul when you think of vex you've all maybe often thought of all lot just went oh man this worlds are so bad oh I'm just so grieved by all the sin that's not at all what it means when it says lots soul was vexed it means that lots righteousness whatever he had whatever he had gained with Abraham whatever he had learned with Abraham whatever spirituality he had garnered for himself whatever he went and sought him with the zeal the passion for the random said he was a pastor of a church whatever zeal he had by immersing himself in the culture of Sodom he had it had worn him out it had tired him down look at this exhaust with labor to afflict or oppress with evil to make trouble for to treat roughly this it had he had battered this man lot it had vexed his righteous soul that cat upon EO is a compound word of the Greek word kata and the Greek word Peniel the word kata means total dominance or total control and and and and so it carries the idea of domination pani o means to work to the point of exhaustion so when you put those two words you have this word a compound word here which means total and complete exhaustion like after work you're just completely exhausted this is the description of lot he had so immersed himself and he was so vexed with Sodom it had taken all of the righteousness out of him amen stand your feet we're gonna stop there pick it up amen Lord Jesus thank you Father for this morning service Lord for those that Lord will hear this by way of Archive Lord those that have gathered here today Lord we thank you for your word we ask now God that you would take these things Lord may it may it challenges Lord may it prick our conscience Lord father's wheat that's what that's what your Bible says Lord that it would stir us up Laura may its thirst this morning father as we think about these things we've heard Lord bless this service now God may your presence just be in this building being the music and the singing Lord and the worship for all that you're going to do today we cut we came with expectation now Lord we invite you to come in Jesus name Amen
