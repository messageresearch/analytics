I mean, you know, you don't want to be a breeding ground for the wrong thoughts and then they produce fruit that you're ashamed of. Amen. Let's pray. Father, we love you this morning. It's just so good to be in the house of the Lord. And Lord, we didn't come for one another. Though we do appreciate one another, but we all came to see you, Father. And that part that you have in each one of us, Father, may it come together as a pillar of fire and worship of spirit and truth unto you. For you are worthy of all worship, glory, and praise. Father, pray that you would just bless those that are streaming, those that couldn't be here. Father, we want to remember these requests, spouses, lost loved ones, and we can remember, Father, the the period of sorrow and grief. And Father, that just overwhelms. We pray for this family. We pray for Gary Freeman. Father, I pray that you would comfort his heart most of all that you'd reveal yourself to him in a special way. Give him strength and comfort in this time. Lord, for Gary Hall having stomach troubles. Father, none of us likes to feel sick. None of us likes to feel under the weather regardless of what it is. We pray for him this morning, Father, that you may receive all the glory and honor. Touch his body, Father. Look upon our hearts this morning, Lord. Those that are not feeling well, those that are sick, battling different things. Father, there is nothing that can stand before you, Lord. Nothing that can stand before your purpose. We love you this morning. We praise you. We just pray that you would be pleased with our worship. Help us, Father, clean our hearts out that we may leave here better than when we came in. Lord, as we collect the tithes and offerings, I pray that you would bless the cheerful giver. Father, Lord, I thank you for your your consistent care for your children. We need you each and every day. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. [Music] What a lovely name the name of Jesus. Reaching higher far than the brightest star.

[Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you want to turn your eyes to him this morning? God bless you. So good to be here back in the house of the Lord together. If you have your Bible, we'll turn to the book of First Kings, chapter 18. Amen. We'll go straight to the word this morning. Sorry for the delay there. I was trying to get something just ready there just for this morning. Wanted to make sure I had that done before we came out. So you excuse me, Brother Matthew, for holding you there. But um you love the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. So good to be back in the house of the Lord and uh thankful that God has um kept us through another year of camp and uh we had a wonderful time and I really believe the Lord changed many lives, did many things, many testimonies that we even have uh coming in through various ways uh group chats and emails. And so I want to share just some things upon my heart this morning. Um, we want to be praying first off for my dad, our pastor who um, just yesterday started feeling a little bit under the weather. Gave me a little warning that um, just depending on how he went through the night if I would be uh, having to take the service this morning. And then this morning about uh, 7:30 or so, he um, he let me know that he wasn't feeling uh, very good. He's uh, just has a really scratchy throat, a lot of pain in his throat, and then a fever feeling like was coming upon him. So, um, you just want to keep him in prayer. Remember him this morning that the Lord just gives him a speedy recovery for whatever that is. I know there's a lot of people traveling also. Uh, we have quite a few families out this morning that are traveling. And, uh, and also some who are, uh, not well. And so, we know this is that time of year where sickness can go through. And, um, I tell you what, it's a miracle we didn't all come back from a a place with 500 and something people. And uh it's a miracle we don't have many uh more that we do uh sick and out. So I believe the Lord just spared us. I'm thankful for that. Amen. And and we just we're thankful for health, aren't we? &gt;&gt; You know you how you appreciate health, get sick. &gt;&gt; And uh when you get sick, you you you realize how much you take for granted health. I think God sometimes does that. Get lets us allows things to come upon us uh to contrast to make us thankful. Amen. when when there are times of um of of health. And so we're thankful for that. Second Kings chapter 18, I just want to um want to read just a portion of scripture here, then I'll have you be seated. Today, I want to just uh just share some things upon my heart. You um allow me to do that today. I don't really have a a full sermon. I don't really want to preach a full sermon. I want to also reflect on some of the things at camp and um just take a moment. We we are we actually don't ever really get this opportunity. Camp sort of comes it goes and then we last year we met at uh Urban Brew and with um all of the people and helpers at camp and was able to thank them personally. So I get that opportunity today, amen, to do that. And so I want to take a minute to do that and just to recognize some people. Amen. And reflect on what the Lord, not just what he did, but what he's doing. Aren't you glad that the Lord is actively working in our life? It's not just what he's what he's what he's done yesterday, but what he's actively doing. Amen. I believe I just want to say, Lord, I want to be a part of it. I want to be a part of what he's doing in this day. Second King First Kings chapter 18, let me just read a vers a portion of scripture. I want to just give this a title. Build an altar. That's what our title is going to be today. Build an altar. Let me make sure I have my text correct here. First Kings chapter 18. We'll we'll get to this scripture here in just a moment. I just want to um cover it here. Second Kings chapter 18. We'll read of just a portion and then have you be seated. First Kings. I'm Second Kings is First Kings is where I'm wrong. That's why I'm confused. Thank you, brother Andrew. Because I'm in First Kings and I'm thinking this is not lining up where it was supposed to be. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; And Brother Andrew. Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. Say, "Praise the Lord." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is familiar to us, real familiar with Elijah on Mount Carmel. Let's just begin reading at verse 27. And it came to pass at noon that Elijah mocked them and said, "Cry aloud, for he is a god. Either he is talking or he is pursuing, or he is in the journey, for her adventure he sleepeth must be awakened." And they cried aloud and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancet till the blood gushed out upon them. And it came to pass when midday was passed and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that there was neither voice nor any to answer nor any that regarded. And Elijah said unto all the people, "Come near unto me." And all the people came near unto him. And this is where I want to draw our emphasis right here. And he repaired the altar of the Lord that was broken down. and he repaired the altar of the Lord that was broken down. You just want to bow your heads with me. Jesus, we thank you, Lord, that you're in control of all things, Lord. And I believe that you're mindful of us, &gt;&gt; of our own insufficiencies, Lord, and our needs. For there are many, Lord. No doubt, God, there would be a hand that could go up here this morning if I was to ask for anybody that needs a touch from the Lord. Maybe a touch in their body. Would you come and do that, Lord Jesus? Maybe a touch in their family, in their children, in their marriage, Lord, in relationships and their finances, God. Our needs would be many, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we're so thankful, Lord, that you care about all of them. And there is no need too small. There is no need too great. For that's Lord the kind of father that we have. One who supplies all of our needs. I pray God that you would just touch my dad this morning as he's suffering at home. Our pastor Lord go to him Father even now on the wings of this prayer Lord and may you touch his body. Restore his strength Father. Restore Lord God his health. I pray for any of those Lord that would be sick this morning suffering. And I pray God that you would just bring healing Lord God to their bodies Lord. All of those traveling in the way. Bring them back here Lord. Keep them safe Lord on their journey. We ask it in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. You can be seated. Want to take just a moment here at to speak about this text that we just read with Elijah saying to all the people come near unto me. And the Bible says, "And he repaired the altar of the Lord that was broken down." You know, we just came off what we could call quite a mountain. As Elijah, the Bible says, this was the Mount Carmel showdown. Mount Carmel is a representation, you could say, of revival, a time that's really high, really good. You know, feeling like you're in the clouds soaring and you just are on top of the world. How many ever felt that way? Amen. Spiritually speaking, we can have highs. We could also we don't victorious because we're not really in and of ourselves. We don't we don't have any victory of anything that we can do. And so we know that in the in the our life or our journey with God, we can have those moments of high times. And then we would call that the the Mount Carmel experience where Elijah was on the mountain and and there's a great showing of of God's vindication of his ministry with prophets of Baal, you know, coming down to their uh you know the you know uh their altar and the Bible says cutting themselves and jumping up and down and shouting and and then here's Elijah there saying where is you know where is your God? You know, maybe he sleeps, maybe he adventures, maybe it's almost like Elijah's mocking them. And that's exactly what he's doing. He's rubbing it in that their gods are false gods that can't speak, can't help, can't touch, can't heal. But God said, Elijah says, "But let the God that answers by fire, let him vindicate what is right and what is wrong." And I I think that literally and spiritually, we came off very much Bethl Youth Camp. Uh we saw young people surrender their lives to the Lord Jesus for the first time. We ought to thank God for that. &gt;&gt; We seen some from our family here in our own church, others who came from miles and miles away and parents who were uh praying. I always never it always just grabs my heart because I'm a parent also and and I've had my children going to meetings or to camps and all of the times when I know that they're on their journey and they're going there to be in meetings and be in the presence of the Lord. I'm not so much concerned about Lord let them have a good time and let them you know eat lots of good food and let them meet lots of new friends and lots that's I don't know that's never what I'm thinking. And I know that'll happen anyway, but I'm always saying, Lord, get a hold of them. Get a hold of their heart, Lord. Speak to them. You know, let the ministry, I pray for the ministry that'll be in that that'll be ministering. Lord, uh, use them, anoint their vessel to speak something that will get a hold of them, you know, because many times all we can do as parents is just sew the seed. &gt;&gt; And that's all God asks us to do is sew the seed. And it's amazing because so many times you'll hear you you'll watch somebody that's blessed by the Lord and and and and and you've said it, you've told them as parents, the preacher is just saying what you've been saying for years now, but somehow through a different vessel, from a different approach, it takes a something grabs a hold of them &gt;&gt; and then God begins to change their heart. And so that's God's uh that's God's process is for you to sew the seed, continue to sew the seed regardless of what you see or you don't see. Because many times what you don't see is the effect of what you're sewing. And that brings discouragement to say is it doing any good? You know, does it even do any good to gather them around and talk about the Lord? Pray with them. I just see nothing ever changes. But let me just give you a word of encouragement today. Just keep planting the seed of the word of God. And when the season is right, it might not be you. It might be someone else, &gt;&gt; but that seed will germatize &gt;&gt; and come to life. And I think we've seen that at our camp. We've seen we've seen tears fall. We've seen young people shout and some rejoice. Some dance in the spirit. Some speak in tongues. We saw the what I would call the fire of God or what brother Brandham would call the blessings of God. That's what he called the gifts that would fall in the church and shouting and dancing. Those are just the blessings. Aren't you glad we got them though? &gt;&gt; Uh but I believe more than just an external experience. I truly believe with all of my heart that hearts surrendered to the Lord Jesus this past weekend. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I believe that the real test isn't necessarily what happens when we could we could our sermon today our our inspiration is build an altar. And it struck me so much because in our reading here, if you'll notice, God never put the pressure or the responsibility upon Elijah to manufacture the fire. Amen. &gt;&gt; In fact, Elijah wasn't going to bring any of the fire. All God needed Elijah to do was to prepare the altar. &gt;&gt; And then he would be the one that sent the fire. &gt;&gt; And so, it isn't our job. It was never our job. It's never our job as parents, as church, as pastors, as leaders, as parents. It's never your job to manufacture the fire or to send the experience. All God asks us to do is to repair the broken altar, prepare the wood, and then expect a blessing to come from God &gt;&gt; to bring the fire. And so all God needed Elijah to do was repair the altar. Because the test, the real test isn't what happens when the fire falls. But can I say it to you this way? It's what happens when we go home. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because non- youth camp, non-meouragement, that's really where character or can I say it this way, that's really the fire that proves whether you got something real or just an emotional workup. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you can have shouting at camp. You can have rejoicing at camp. But if that doesn't turn into a life that's surrendered to God, come on church. &gt;&gt; Then what good was the fire that fell? &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; The fire in Elijah's day was not to be a burning fire that it was a supernatural experience. I mean, he pours buckets of water in that ditch and then God comes down with supernatural fire and doesn't just consume the sacrifice, but the Bible says he licks up all of the water that was in the trenches. &gt;&gt; Now, that was a supernatural experience. But can I just say, what good would the fire have been as supernatural as it was if the people did not turn their hearts back to God? Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, the purpose was repairing the altar. Can you preach with me this morning? &gt;&gt; The purpose was to repair the altar. Because if we don't keep if we want to keep the fire burning, we have to understand something that's so simple, but I believe is so profound. And that is our job was never to send the fire. Our job is just to maintain the fire upon the altar that God sends. &gt;&gt; I think it's amazing because in scripture you can read about this. Before God ever sent revival, before God ever sent any kind of supernatural experience, revival, revelation, before God ever spoke peace uh uh uh to to to the earth, again, man first had to build an altar. You think of Abraham. The Bible says in Genesis 12:7, "The Lord appeared unto Abram and he built an altar unto the Lord." That's Genesis 12:7. Genesis 13:18. Then Abram removed his tent and built an altar unto the Lord. So every place, every chapter, every stop that Abraham made in his journey, the first thing he did before beginning that part of his journey or that phase was he first built an altar. &gt;&gt; Before he built a house, before the house of the Lord was built, there first was an altar. Amen. &gt;&gt; Before he pitched a tent, the Bible says he made an altar. You see, that's how important our altar is. &gt;&gt; God doesn't want religion or just hype or just good works or just good deeds or external uh Christianity. What he wants is an altar upon the heart that burns with the passion of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Isaac uh the Bible says in Genesis 26:25 that he built an altar there and called the upon the name of the Lord. So he didn't start over. He just rebuilt the Bible says he rebuilt the wells. He redug the wells. He rebuilt the altar. Genesis 35:1 Jacob, you know this very well. The Bible says unto that God said unto Jacob, "Go up to Bethl and dwell therein." And the Bible says this, "And make an altar unto God." &gt;&gt; So God told Jacob, "Go back to Bethl." Which Bethl means what? Come on, Bethl. What does Bethl mean? &gt;&gt; The house of God. So before you can have the house of God, God says first build an altar. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, it was a call back to his first love, to his original flame. You know what's so powerful about that story about Jacob? If you ever go read that in Genesis, the Bible says Jacob has a dream. You remember the story? How many remember that he has a dream? A ladders going from heaven to earth and angels ascending and the Bible says descending. And the scripture says, "And God stood above it all." And so Jacob sees this supernatural experience, a ladder that goes up, the angels goes up, goes down, showing God's activity. Jacob wakes up out of his dream and thinks, "Oh my, what happened? Surely the Lord was in this place and I knew it not." And the Bible says, "And he built an all, he took a pillow, he took a stone where his head was upon where he was sleeping, and he memorialized that stone. He pours oil." You imagine seeing Jacob out there and then you think, "What is this guy doing? and he's pouring anointing oil upon a rock. What was it? It was there was something that rock might have been a rock, original rock, just nothing to nobody before. But when God does something for you, that church becomes important. That that altar becomes important. That sermon becomes important because what was it? It was what grabbed a hold of you. And Jacob begins to pour oil upon that stone and he wakes up and says, "Oh, surely the Lord was in this place and I knew it not. This is none other than the gate of heaven. And he says, "And Jacob called the name of that place Bethl, meaning the house of God." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But you know what? His life was not changed. &gt;&gt; He had an altar. He had a sacrifice. He had a supernatural experience. &gt;&gt; But yet, he went right after that. But you go right back to the next chapter and he's not going he's he's going a million miles away from God in lust in in temper in in carnal things. &gt;&gt; And God keeps telling him, "Come back to Bethl. Come back to Bethl. Come back to Bethl." And Jacob would build an altar. He'd have an experience. But he would never turn his heart or surrender his heart back to God. &gt;&gt; Although Bethl meant the house of God. Go read your Bible, though. What's so powerful is that when God finally gets a hold of Jacob's heart, finally &gt;&gt; Dena's, you know, finally hold of him. The Bible says this that Jacob tells his tells his family, "Throw out your idols, take off your earrings." That's what he says in the Bible. Take throw them all off of you. And it says, "And let's build an altar and make a sacrifice unto God." And Jacob does that. God comes down, anoints it just like he did the first altar and sends experience. But then the you know what's so different? You read this. The Bible says that he calls the name of that place El Bethl &gt;&gt; because you see Bethl means the house of God. But Elbethl means the God of the house. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So what do we what do we want here? We don't just want the house of God. How many want to say, "Lord, I want the God of the house." &gt;&gt; Moses, you can think of, I'm just skipping some of these because there's too many. Moses built an altar. Called the name of that place, altar became a memorial of victory. Gideon, Judges 6, built an altar to the Lord. Uh David in 2 Samuel 24 builds an altar to the Lord. Elijah, we just read it. He places after he rebuilt the altar and and the fire fell from heaven. Here they see a burning fire. But yet there would never be a fire without an altar. First there must be an altar which is a place of sacrifice. It's a place of repentance and it's a place of surrender. Prophet of God even talks about applying the token. He says when you come for the token what are you what are you doing? And he says you're not up there and in and one place he says you're not up there beating your buddy on the back at the altar laughing and huron and shouting. There's a place for shouting, &gt;&gt; but he says when you really come to the altar, there's no there's no there's no beating yourself and clapping your hands. And he says, but you're there to be identified with death, your sacrifice. &gt;&gt; And he says, you're coming dying out to yourself, surrender, repentance, sacrifice. Friends, you can shout, scream, dance, and I'm all for all. Even preach, and I'm for all of those things. But if the altar is in disrepair, the fire has no place to fall. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't call upon God. Elijah couldn't call upon God with a broken altar. &gt;&gt; And I just I just want to say youth camp, 10 youth camps, 15. Someone suggested to me, Brother Matt, we should do a bianual youth camp. Oh dear. twice a year, three times a year. Let me just tell you though, whether you did 10 a year, one every week, I don't care how many emotional experiences you want to have, if your altar is in disrepair, &gt;&gt; there is no true fire that falls and changes your heart. &gt;&gt; He didn't start with a prayer. Elijah didn't start with a prayer. He started with repair. &gt;&gt; Repair the altar. And he didn't even ask God for that fire until that altar was in order. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Listen, brother Brandham says the old fashion, this is leadership. The oldfashioned altar calls, they're out of style today, but God still moves in them. Brother Brandham hated that that they he that they had abandoned the altar, even just something as physical as an altar call because God works so powerfully in that because it's a way that we humble ourselves. &gt;&gt; Coming to the altar is humbling yourself. &gt;&gt; That's why God can use them. People want to say, "Brother Brandon was against altars." That's not true. He was against what the denominations had turned altar calls into. &gt;&gt; But the true altar and altar was in the very beginning. Even the zodiac with the lion, Leo the lion, all of there's the the altar is in those in the stars also because it was in the mind of God. Brother Brandon says here, he says um he says if they put them down there, this is and I will restore. If they put them down at the altar and let them pray there until they come through with the baptism of the Holy Ghost, they'd stay put. &gt;&gt; That's a powerful quote. &gt;&gt; This is this is this is what this is what brother Brandham advocated. He advocated this this as he says, "Put them at the altar and let them pray there, Terry there." Not just a simple prayer, but tar there till they come through with the baptism of the Holy Ghost. They'd stay put. He says this here, "And I will restore." June 20th, 1954. God don't want liies on the altar. He wants sinners on the altar. &gt;&gt; God don't want your lily. He wants you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're the person that needs to be on the altar. I can read these. I can go on and on. Jesus saw the authority. Listen what he says here. When he fulfilled the vision of the Lord, showed him the fire of God fell out of the heavens and consumed the sacrifice. He's referring to Mount Carmel there. Uh Abel, listen to what he says here. And I will restore. Abel died on the altar with his lamb. And every man that comes to Christ must die on the same altar of self-sacrifice, forgetting your own ways. We die out to Christ on the altars of God's sacrifice and Jehovah God sending down the Holy Spirit stamping a seal on it as a confirmation. You say, "Brother Matt, what are you saying?" And I'm saying that I'm afraid if we're not careful, we replace an emotional experience or some worship song where we all feel the I'm not saying you don't feel the presence of God, but we all just raise our hands and think that's enough. Listen, friends, a one-time experience there with your emotions is not enough. I believe it's time we come back to the altar of humbling oursel and repenting and surrendering to God. Do I have a church that believes that God is not done using the altar or altar calls? God wants to bring lives, not your liies. He wants your life on that altar. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then he says, "Then after the foul," listen to what he says here. This is thy church. Then after the fire fell on the Ohio River in 1930, a healing revival swept the the world. a fire that falls upon an altar. Just going to move on through some of this because I'm already finding that I just can't never do good about my time. So, y'all forgive me. I just want to reflect here just for a moment because I believe God did something so powerfully upon the altar, the altars of hearts this weekend. And and I believe I I want to be clear. I'm I'm I I I love all of all of camp. I love every year of camp that we've had. I love some of the moments of uh exhilarating energy you could feel in that room and and some of it there was just so powerful you could see if brother if you could just play that sister Sarah I sent you that you can just have that just on the screen just going skip through some of it just parts of the worship uh service there and then uh until I tell you just keep letting the worship play uh just make sure it's parts where the worship is taking place I just want you can drag that over and bring that up don't have any sound there in the back. Just keep that. Don't watch that so much. Look at it, glance at it. But listen to what I'm saying here. I just want to bring you uh by just a way to refresh your mind because I believe that God did something so special this past weekend. As I said, I thankful for every camp. I'm thankful for everything God did every year at camp and some of the moments of the energy of the worship of 500 uh uh people that are just worshiping the Lord, calling on God, the presence of the Lord sweeping through the building and and how many were there? Raise your hand if you were there at camp. We got quite a few out, quite a few that are here that quite a few out that were there. And it was just I can just say just whenever you want, Caleb, you could just start playing that. Yeah, just have that up. Uh, it was a powerful moment. Powerful moments there. Thankful for all of them. But can I just say what what I'm the most thankful for real simple is hearts that surrendered to God. &gt;&gt; Because that's the only reason we do any of it. &gt;&gt; I love every part of it, but that's the only reason we do any of it. It's in the downloads file folder. I I air dropped it there. Get it on the screen. Play it. Go ahead and start. I'm not waiting. I'm just going to talk right over the top of it. So, you can drag it over. Is it working? So, okay. That's fine. Work through those. That's okay. Let's forget I said it. We might not have it. That's okay. I I I really don't want you to be distracted by that. I want you just to listen because this is really what the Lord just called me to for this morning. I I just think it's amazing when I think about Youth Camp and when I I just want to just take a moment to say it is absolutely nothing short of a miracle that this little small church &gt;&gt; in a seaside city on the east coast that doesn't isn't on the way to anywhere. I tell people all the time, people say, "What's in Buford?" Marines and believers. And if you're a believer and live here, you're not. You're here because there's a church here. It's a beautiful place. But but it's amazing that that our little church, the sacrifice that we make that we could put on a camp to that size and to that scale is amazing. That t that screen does look off, brother Caleb, if you're trying to get it to come on. There it goes. It's on now. Thank you. I think that was the problem. It's amazing that something to that scale would happen. Make sure Proresenter is closed. Make sure it's closed completely. Um to think that our church, our whole church gets behind it. Stand up. Only you that were at camp. Stand up. Can you do it? Just you that were there. I want those that weren't there just to put your eyeballs on them just for a [Music] &gt;&gt; and all those that aren't. He's a chain breaker. [Music] &gt;&gt; I want you to know this is why we don't have church for church services. &gt;&gt; If you believe &gt;&gt; because most of our church is gone. &gt;&gt; If you can feel it, somebody testify. &gt;&gt; We tear our apart. &gt;&gt; Hours upon hours upon hours helping put it back together. Why don't you think of all those people that were there sacrificed their time, their labor for lives that would be changed? Those that aren't here. Uh and brother George Buckman also stand. Brother George stand. He wasn't at camp, but I want him to stand because this brother worked tirelessly with me and him for hours upon hours upon hours. And he's not old, but he's not young and I'm not going to say either. And and worked worked uh with me. Couldn't do it without him. Impossible. Why don't you give all of these these these workers a hand? Give them a good hand. Give yourself a hand. Be seated. Just skip through parts of that. Just parts of that. I just want to bring it back up to your memory and your mind. It's incredible that we can put on this type of camp. I It really is. It's nothing short of a miracle. Um, so many people put their own time, their money, their effort into it with not getting paid anything at all and paying uh to be there as we as Carolina Point charges every person that's going to be there the same exact amount. These people gave of their time. Didn't make any money. We're just volunteering their their their time away. None of them to be seen. None of them did it to be a pat on the back. They did it for one thing. that God could have an altar where kids could come to and surrender their lives to the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; That's the only reason we do it. I want it to be clear. We built an altar. That's all. &gt;&gt; That's what God told us to do. Repair the altar of the Lord. A lot of people, you know, can I just say that that I'll just take just a moment just to say this really quickly. A lot of people have complimented how good the video is, how good the audio. There was a team there that done that and how much we it's incredible that we have something like this. The video that we have, the audio that we have, and and and got testimony after testimony after testimony, people saying, "I felt like I was there. Thank you. I felt like I was right in in the room." And that's why we do it. And I'll just give it just a little short uh mission statement. Well, you say, "Brother Matt, why do you put so much time and effort? And couldn't you save yourself so much effort just to put a little, you know, PTZ camera, security cam at the back with a wide view and and never moves and you just watch the room and and have sound &gt;&gt; like this over 10 cam. &gt;&gt; You could do all of that and I could why why wouldn't you do that? I tell you why. And just tell you my own inspiration in COVID during COVID 2020 and all my kids were home and we were all home and I I get to watch my kids that you don't get to pay attention to as much and they're on their phones. They're con they're consuming content. They're watching videos from you know I just you know different won't name any names but music good music some of it uh from from uh you know from different mega churches and different you know groups and you know who I'm talking about different ones and and they're in video and you're watching the video and they're playing on the screen and we're watching and then you're hearing all these you know uh you know non-denom some non-denomination non-es believers but they're putting out music that sounds good people Mike I realize my kids I don't they don't grow up in the world that I grew up in. &gt;&gt; Whether you like it or not, parents, this is a content consumption age. &gt;&gt; Whether we like it or not. &gt;&gt; Oh, bless God, we ought to go back to no to live streaming. Okay, I don't you might you that might be your approach. My approach is God's word meets the challenge of the day, the hour, the moment. &gt;&gt; And many times we want to look back, but this what we're facing today is a different world. It's a different age. They're watching stuff. And so I just thought here my kids are spending hours upon hours on Spotify and listening to, you know, secular, not secular, but Christian contemporary is what I mean to say, music, and they got their videos and they look good. I thought, well, if they're going to consume content, why can't we have something that doesn't look like it was put on a bubblegum budget? Why why can't we have something that is nice for our people to be able to listen to bride music? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are do you do you get what I'm saying here this morning? &gt;&gt; So that's why we do what we do because I want there to be if if the world has if the nominal church has that I'm not trying to compete with them but brother Brandham said if you're going to do something for God do your best. &gt;&gt; And so if that means cameras and more angles and better views and higher definition and better sound then to God be the glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. It it's amazing because so many people put their time, put their effort and and every young person whose life was changed. I want to say to those who work tireless, I know there's many who wanted to help and couldn't. I just want to say that for every life that was changed, you'll have a blessing on the other side for that work and labor you put in. I I there's so many different uh categories here that I could read from, and I'm just going to do it here for a moment. I want you to um recognize the musicians that were there. We had brother Steve Curtis, Brother Micah Curtis, Sister Julia, uh Buckman, Sister Deborah Jackson, Brother Andrew Cobb, Brother Chris Watkins, Brother John Lineich, Brother Aaron. Why don't we give all of these brothers and sisters a hand? Amen. We had deacons there. Some serving from not all the people I'm going to even hear today are from. We had others from other churches that helped deacons and worship leaders. I want to thank brother Tony for how much he did with the worship service and leading worship year after year faithfully like that. I believe brother Tony uh deserves a round of applause even though he's not here this morning. The security team that that worked there, all the brothers that were there and and the concession team. And I just I I I just want to say here for a moment that um there were so many people that helped. I couldn't even name all the names, but there were so many different people. I want you if you helped in concessions or hot food, stand. If you did at all, stand to your feet. Go ahead. Do it, sisters. Don't be shy. Stand up. Stand up. All of those that helped in concessions and some of those that aren't here, stand up. Stand up. You're not done. I I want you to give this crew a round of applause. They deserve it. Amen. And and I can't say enough about my wife. I really can't. And I don't think many of you can either. &gt;&gt; Even if you tried, it wouldn't be enough. &gt;&gt; Who worked so hard and so tirelessly puts her whole uh everything she's got into that to to be a blessing to make camp possible. And all the workers that headed that team up. Sister Amber Smith heading up the check-in team and and and and and all of the work and stood up. She stood up for the concessions. Brother uh you know uh Tony could have stood up for security. I I would do it, but I just don't want people to, you know, stand and sit stand and sit. But so many people play multiple roles. It wasn't just one. They wore so many hats serving in so many different departments. It was unbelievable. the security team, the concessions team, the check-in team, their registration, the Urban Brew, Brother Ken and Sister Caitlyn for coming and being a part. Why don't we give them a hand cuz I promise you it was a labor of love who donated the proceeds of that to go back to help us pay for our camp. I just want to say thank you to them, to Sister Nita, all of those, Sister Abby, the different ones who came and helped with that. Thank you for doing that. the the medical staff, Sister Meredith and and and Brother Andrew and and I'm not sure if you did, Sister Ruth, different ones in our medical team that were there.

Also, Dawson Massingo came and helped also early and all of the AV crew that came here and met us. As I said, Brother George didn't go to camp, met us here to help us pack up, label everything, take everything apart, come back to put it all back together so we could have church today. Abby and Jackson and and uh Travis who worked in the broadcast booth and Caleb who worked there so tirelessly. Please don't let me forget anybody from our church. Um for the AV team, the skit team also, Sister Deborah, before we do that, give the AV team a great big hand. Thank you so much. And uh and and Brother Doug Bowman, who's not here, but cooked about 500 burgers. Give brother Doug because he will watch this. Thank you, brother Doug. Thanks for that macho nacho burger he made.

And brother Travis Jackson for doing all of the activities, the volleyball, all of the different sports and awards that he did. Give Brother Travis a hand also for that. Thank you. the ministry that was there, the counselors, the work crew. We couldn't even, you know, time would fail me as as the as the book of Hebrews says to tell about all of those that that help there. Uh if I'm forgetting anybody, text me quick. Um all of those that that help there at camp and everybody who played their part. Um also, Brother Kevin who's not here, thankful to all of his work and sister Sarah for stepping in and filling a void when it was needed and and to help with the administration of camp. And brother Brad is not here. Man, I I I didn't want to start calling names because I will bound to forget people. Um, and so I just want to say thank you. Sister Emily Curtis also has been a counselor every single year since we started. It's a hard job. We choose very carefully. Thank you, Sister Emily. Give her a hand for doing that year after year. And brother Steve to go without her night after night. Brother Wes Ardell, different ones who came. and so many so so so many I could I could say that came and were helpful and were a part. I just want to say thank you for coming. It was a I believe a a a investment that will be worth it and will echo throughout the hills of eternity. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Um make sure I'm not forgetting here anything today. Let me just read through my notes. Um yes uh just so much so many people were so essential. um to the camp in so many ways and and uh I just am so thankful the planning group that we have that gets starts February usually of every year and starts planning for youth youth camp um really in May or June especially working very hard the planners it's a huge sacrifice um and so I just want to say um I I would just like to say thank you if you're a young person and you were at camp one of our own youth why don't you Stand up just for a second. Stand up. If you were a young person and you were at camp, even if you weren't a camper, Emariah, stand up. Every young person that was there, I want you to look because this is the next generation of Bethl Youth Camp, give them a hand for being a testimony. Amen. Be seated. Thank you. And I just want to say thank you so much to all of those um brother Andrew for taking all the specials in that you did the way you did. I'm getting texts so I'm just reading these. So many people are thinking of so many people. Sorry if I miss anybody uh today, but I just want to say thank you so much. And I believe that heaven uh is happy. I believe the Lord Jesus is happy and he's pleased. Aren't you glad you could do a part? &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad you can be a part? And if you weren't at camp, um, if you weren't at camp and, um, and you want and weren't able to help, we understand that. If you want to help, we always need more help. Every single year, it seems like getting more and more help. I just want to take just a moment before we close just to think about the ministers just before it's 12:18, so I'll get you out way earlier than than we usually are. Can you just give me a couple more minutes? Just a couple more. Um, I just want to say how much I'm thankful to Brother Ronnie Long for coming. Um, also, yes, Jonathan and Martha, thank you so much for the hikes that they did and actually my brother helping with the prayer line. I don't want to forget making them a hand. Amen. And so, I I uh I want to thank brother Ronnie for coming and and just take a moment. Brother Ronnie started and opened our service. I thought it was just so powerful with just a yes. That's what brother Ronnie's uh thought was upon was God is only looking for a yes. How many appreciated what our brother Ronnie spoke? I think it was called the power of yes or the power of a yes. And and and he talked about reclaiming the ground for God, reclaiming your ground. him. He talk he took the scripture out of Romans chapter uh 10 where the Bible says the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth and in thy heart that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in thy heart thou shalt be saved. And and brother Ronnie opened it just with these on my notes. I'm not asking for a lot tonight. I'm just asking for a one thing, a yes, just one word. He reminded us that our confession has power. &gt;&gt; Amen. and that what we speak in our mouth can shape an atmosphere. &gt;&gt; I believe it shaped the whole youth camp. &gt;&gt; That power of yes, agreeing with God's word can break strongholds in people's lives. Years that of struggle and just a yes, just an agreement uh uh based on upon the word of God. He told us that we're we're in Lady Aia, but we're not Ladyans. He reminded us that uh young people that you weren't born in this age by accident, but that God saw the age you would live in and the confusion and the filth and the social pressure, the temptations of technology. And yet he still sent you here anyway because he called you and trusted you to be an overcomer. &gt;&gt; And and and that line just stuck with me. You're not in Lady. You're you're in Lady A, but you're not Lady Aans. You're of this, you're in this world, but you're not of the world. You're different. The world, the word makes you different than the world. He talked about how that you're sponsored. You've got a sponsor. You've been sponsored by the Lord Jesus. Remember that? He talked about Nike sponsoring LeBron James for $75 million a year. Not because he's average, not because he's just another guy playing basketball because they but because they believe in him. And then brother Ronnie says, "And Christ has sponsored you." Think about that. He put his name upon you. He put his badge upon you. And he didn't sponsor you to fall or to be a lady of sin. He sponsored you to overcome. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and he's never lost a battle. Amen. He's never backed up. He's never apologized. And that's that's whose logo you're wearing. The logo of the Holy Ghost is our emblem. That's the team I'm part of. &gt;&gt; He talked about that to say yes to God and not to the devil. reminded us that the devil only has the power that we loan him through our thoughts. When you start believing his his lies, you begin to empower his works. But when you say yes to the promises of God, you strip him of that power. He said you didn't God didn't send you to this age to be powerless. He he equipped you with everything you need to overcome every enemy that you will face. Anxiety, depression, fear. They might attack you, but they can't own you because Christ bought you already. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; These are just reminders of some of the things we learn. I just don't want the fire to go out. I want these to be important to us. I believe God said something to us. He talked about David and how even David's own father didn't believe in him. He wasn't the strongest. He wasn't the tallest. He wasn't the most qualified. But when God called David, David said yes. And that yes anointed him to tear down and to bring down giants. He talked about Isaiah who answered the call when God said, "Who shall I send?" And he said, "Here am I. Send me." That one yes. Changed an entire nation. Um and he asked the question, "Do I have any Isaiah's in the building? Do I have any Davids in the building? Any Paul's? People that are willing to forsake their own ways and just say yes to God." He told us that your yes changes everything. Sometimes God just wants a yes. Not an explanation, not a plan, just a yes. He told us that many of the struggles we face aren't meant to crush us. They're meant to reveal the potential that's been stored inside of us all along. The potential means stored energy. And God placed that energy inside of us before the foundation of the world. Uh friends, I believe it was a challenge to our church. It was a challenge to our young people. Uh we uh to to give a yes. Will you say yes to the call? Yes to the surrender. Yes to the change. Yes to the freedom. Yes to be used by God. I I loved brother Paul's sermon. He preached to us and also the devotions. I won't get into those this morning. They were wonderful uh there with brother Paul and and brother Diggs. And brother Paul's sermon was I I believe if I got the title right was called the zeal of thine house or something like that. Is that right? something like that. And he and he talked about it was a call it was it was a sermon about personal revival. How many of you remember that sermon? If you didn't, it's on the internet. You can go back and stream it. You could take that down now. Thank you. He talked about the zeal for the house of God and he talked about men who had gone on before. story referenced brother Hilderbrand I believe brother Biscoll brother Soraniano different ones who had passed away men who were examples uh in the house of God. He said something that was so powerful. He said never underestimate that God puts images in our lives to inspire us to encourage us and to set the road right before us. He he told us about the Apostle Paul's words, "Follow me as I follow Christ." How that God always has someone in your life, a living example to show you the way. Doesn't leave you without a guide. The Holy Spirit's the guide. But God puts men in your life, people in your life, mothers, fathers, leaders that that God says these are people that have been sent as beacons to to light the way. &gt;&gt; You remember brother Ann told about that story? I forget the man's name in present stage of my ministry. He's talking about he has that dream of brother Brandham and he says and I was following you and I lost you and you went up the mountain and and and he says how do I get there and brother Brandham says he says brother just follow the bloody footsteps because that's what I did. I followed the bloody footsteps of the Lord Jesus. He talked about this King Josiah young man eight years old who carried a burden for the house of God. Brother Paul said Josiah was known for what what what we'd call a spiritual house cleaning. The Bible says he removed groves and altars and spirits and some of the things that the Bible records that were happening right around the house of God, right by the temple of God. Some some of the most terrible things you could ever imagine. Trash that was just there. And and it was amazing enough that go that there was right near the right in the church they were there was you know uh temple prostitutes and all kinds of just things that you wouldn't believe were written in the Bible. And brother Paul said it was it was bad enough that they were there in church. What was worse is that no one was saying anything about it &gt;&gt; and that people had just became okay with it until God dropped the Josiah man who said yes. He dropped something a young man just a youth into his heart to clean the house of God. Then he came to that powerful part you all remember where he talked about and when they got to cleaning Josiah started cleaning the house of God. And when he was in the middle of cleaning they found the book &gt;&gt; and the open book revelation to Josiah is what changed everything for the children of Israel. And while they were sweeping and removing the clutter, Hilkkey, I believe the high priest in the Bible that finds the book of the law buried somewhere in the house of God. Had it been destroyed, it hadn't been burned. It was just buried under what they had neglected. &gt;&gt; Some just some reflections from camp. I believe it's powerful &gt;&gt; because that book was open to Josiah. Brother Paul said that's why his actions were to clean. That's why he went about cleaning the house. When the word was opened, everything changed. Conviction comes, cleansing comes, repairing the altar cl comes. He didn't just read. He didn't just read the book that they found. &gt;&gt; He responded to the book that they found. Not just intellectually, it caused action. It did something in his life. He read us Psalms 69 verse9, the zeal of thine house has eaten me up. Reminded us this scripture pointed to Jesus when Jesus goes into the temple and found it being used for money and for selling and and he turns the tables over and takes a whip and and he says, "My house shall be called a house of prayer. You've made it a den of thieves. You've made it, you know, a house of reproach." became a marketplace and and he he he talks about the phenomenon. You remember this the phenomenon he read an article about the phenomenon of the third generation. How many remember that the third generation? He read from a study showing how that every movement even brought it down into every family, every church tends to go through with this third generation pattern. The first generation is dynamic, full of sacrifice, full of fire, full of potential, full of vision. But then the second generation starts to try to protect the movement. Remember that? &gt;&gt; And they they inherit what the first one built. And they focus on maintaining what rather than advancing, rather than going forward, they just focus on maintaining what the first generation accomplished. And then he talked about the third generation comes along and they've only heard the stories. They've only have the memories. They only have the history. They didn't live it. It wasn't their life. They don't feel the same way about it. And he says that third generation is marked by decline. And they start asking, "Why are we even doing this?" &gt;&gt; Isn't that amazing? Why the prophet of God in the Ephesian church age said, "God has no grandchildren." &gt;&gt; One revival isn't just passed down to the next revival because because this is what will happen. and the third generation phenomenon where we have children that were raised in the message some who were in brother Brandham's meetings defended it fought for it lived it was their focus their burden their passion and then the second generation just comes along and says yeah we believe all that let's protect what we have and let's try to maintain what we have then the third as generations go and time goes the third generation has no connection to that &gt;&gt; and so they go what what is this what is this dress code what is dresses and p and no p and no makeup and no earrings and a prophet and seventh angel and mysteries and thunders And some of our people don't even read the have never to this if I would to embarrass us embarrass us today to show a ra a raising of hand who has read the church age book from front to back who's read the seven seals book. &gt;&gt; Yeah. This is what's to get us in rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If I was to show a show of hands who's read it that's that third generation curse. But here's what God needs. God needs you to repair your altar and let a fire that fell on the first generation come upon the third and fourth generation to where the revival isn't mamas, daddies, pastors, brothers, sisters. It's my revival. &gt;&gt; He talked about that. He said, "It's simply, you know, brother saying that simply the manifestation of the truth. God has no grandchildren. Each must have their own experience with God. The fervent desire to please God, the passion of know his word, the cry for reach out of the spirit began to fade. Instead of that church being on fire with the fire of God, it's cooled off and became formal. That's what was happening to the Ephesians. And and and and they became concerned. And brother Brandham says it this way. He says they begin to he says he says not care. I'm trying to say the word the way brother Brandham worded it. not to be too careful about what God thought of them and begin to be careful about what the world thought instead. &gt;&gt; And brother Paul said something so powerful. He said, "We live in an hour where young people are constantly comparing themselves on social media. &gt;&gt; Scrolling, watching, comparing, it leads to depression. It leads to emptiness." Can I get an amen? &gt;&gt; You aren't you, Brother Paul said, you're not called to compare yourself with anyone else. You're called to look to God's word and say, "Lord, what do you think of me?" &gt;&gt; When you start trying to conform to the world, you start drifting one small step at a time. One little, as brother Paul, one little deviation from the word is a step away from Christ. &gt;&gt; He talked about when brother Paul talked about worship, he told the story behind the song, Matt Redmond's song, the heart of worship that we sing. I'm coming back to the heart of worship. And he took something so powerful out of that that the song was not wasn't written from it. There was a the church that he read about and how that they became too focused. He felt too focused on music, too centered around performance and production and people weren't enjoying worship. They he says people were enjoying worship but they weren't encountering God. &gt;&gt; So the pastor did something what they thought was radical. He he he he says, "We believe we lost the meaning of worship." And so he removed the instruments. He removed all the lights. He removed the sound system. No band, no tracks, &gt;&gt; just hearts. &gt;&gt; And that's true worship. &gt;&gt; A he began to say, you know, we're it's what the pastor said. We're not going to sing to God until we learn to sing for God again. And God began to move and and he and he sat down with his guitar and began to write the song. I'm coming back to the heart of worship. It's all about you, Jesus. Sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it. When it's all about you. &gt;&gt; It's all about you. This is brother Paul said, that's what happens when the open book is found. Worship goes from performance back to presence, back to his presence. That's what revival really is. coming back to the heart of what it all means. Just for to save time, I'm just going to skip some of this. He talked about Jonah, you know, and and and and he and he talks about the third and fourth generation, and he reminded us God's eyes are on this generation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the Old Testament, he told us that God's eyes always were upon the next generation. Even when the world was dark, God was looking ahead. And and and and this is a powerful statement. I think it's so true. He said, "This camp did not originate with brother Jason. It originated in God's desire to deal with young people. &gt;&gt; That wasn't man's idea. That's God's." And I say, "God, don't ever let it be about our church or us or a ministry. Come on, somebody. Don't ever let it be about my music or or or or some performance or some production that I'm thankful for all of that. But let it be about hearts &gt;&gt; that repair the altar and a fire lights the upon their altar and they're changed from who they were to who God had intended them to be. &gt;&gt; Let it remain the heart of worship. I think it was so powerful some things that were so laser accurate with some of the things brother Paul had to say. Brother Donnie spoke to us on Saturday and and he talked about the danger of an uncsured heart. Amen. &gt;&gt; The church he talked about was God's university and how that even angels learn from us as they watch us and and and the B he quotes the scripture that they're sent to angels are sent to minister to the heirs of salvation and talks about how that they're even learning from us. Ephesians 3 the manifold wisdom of God is being revealed through us that angels actually study our lives to understand mercy and grace and redemption. And he says the church is a university. Each each of you are professors teaching angels by the way you live. That means your trials, your tests, your shortcomings, &gt;&gt; your times you stagger. Many Christians, you know that that there's something God is doing in our life. He's blinging out a story out of our life. He talks about Abraham and his progressive walk of faith. And using Abraham, he showed how that God's dealing comes in stages. progression like progressive revelation. And he and he talked about he talked about Lot how that Lot separated Abraham separated himself from just going through some of these and and he talked about how that Abraham had to separate from everything because total obedience requires total surrender. Total re total separation. Total obedience brings total possession. But you first must have a total separation. Brother Brandon preaches &gt;&gt; of unbelief and partial surrender. Listen, I'm just bringing some of these stones back to your mind here. Partial surrender has consequences. &gt;&gt; He he he quoted from brother Brandham al Shadi. When you come to total obedience, then you can have possession. &gt;&gt; Brother Donnie says, "Yet so many are not yet in total possession because we don't have total surrender." He talked about the I'm just going to go through some of the these things here. talk about the inner battle. How that brother Brandham says, "My greatest enemy is is is me. &gt;&gt; Not my brother, not my sister, it's me." &gt;&gt; And even after decades of ministry, brother Donnie was talking about what he wrestles with the most is his self, his wills, his desires. And the greatest hindrance to more of God isn't what's on the outside that we blame. It's on the internal pride and resistance from the heart. When you surrender fully, he comes in fully. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He talks about how that God wants a complete surrender. We know all of the things he talked about Samson and and and and and how that his heart he gave his strength to Delilah. I'm sorry. He g he gave his strength to God, but Samson gave his heart to Delilah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And all the potential. Brother Brandon makes that comment about there in the church age book I believe that he talks about the the bride church the super church super race and he says and his they will have his potentials &gt;&gt; who's his his potentials &gt;&gt; but potential doesn't mean it'll come to pass &gt;&gt; it takes a surrender can you say amen just closing don't get scared about to close it was it was a it was God imploring us to have a full surrender. God wants a complete surrender and Satan tries to keep us at a half-yielded, halfhearted surrender. And he says, "Some people have walked away from this message not because it wasn't true, but because they never really caught the reality of it." It's not enough to say I believe, brother Brandham. &gt;&gt; We need more than knowledge. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; And that's the call of God today. Surrender. Surrender your heart. Surrender your thoughts. Surrender your will. Surrender your pride. Surrender your all. Not partially. Just feel the Holy Spirit just as we close here today. Surrender completely to him. Surrender your all to him. We want salvation of our home. You know, one man in the Bible cried for that. It's man by the name of one of the most powerful scriptures you'll ever read. I so relate to it. I believe all of us can today. It was a man named Cornelius. And he had one simple request. Save my home. Save it, Lord. Save my home. And all of us today could have a house that needs to be saved. Whether that's literally spiritually, physical salvation needed, spiritual, financial, disaster facing you, threatening your home, threatening your life. I just wrote some of these notes even not really able to preach it here today. But is your house torn by tension, strife, impending problems and rebellion and impaired love or troubled relationships? Is your life, your faith, your marriage, your house in any danger? Is there need for genuine a genuine miracle of God for deliverance and salvation? I'm remember I am preaching today. &gt;&gt; Build an altar. &gt;&gt; And I'm convinced more than ever before Satan is he's not afraid of youth camps, friend. He's not afraid of that one, you know, bubble on the on the on the map, you know, one high spot, you know, big spot that was big and a big moment. He's not afraid of that. He's afraid of people that have a altar that's repaired that the fire of God is burning upon a surrendered heart. He's he's trying Satan is trying everything he can with all his cunningness and wisdom and technology and it's Satan's Eden to destroy homes. If he wants to destroy churches, he must first destroy homes &gt;&gt; and children. You can take could be seduced and deceived by demonic temptations. marriages. Some of them in deep trouble. Some of it look good that aren't good. Sometimes it's not the outward veneer. It's what's happening inside under the surface. &gt;&gt; And a heart that turns away from the truth doesn't look like a heart that turns away because the body doesn't turn first. The heart does. &gt;&gt; And long before the body leaves, the heart leaves. Take people leave the message. long before they got up and walked out and posted on Facebook their freedom, &gt;&gt; their their their freedom, their heart was unsurrendered and had turned away. Long before a man or woman walks out of a marriage, the heart walks out first. &gt;&gt; And if the heart walks out, it's only a matter of time, the body will follow the heart. &gt;&gt; But you ever get a heart turned to Christ, &gt;&gt; and the body will follow what the heart &gt;&gt; goes after. and and and never before has there been homes that are under such duress, stress, pressure of the age that we live in than right now. The very foundations of what we believe uh and Christianity are shaking. It's a just a direct result of brother Brandham's seven visions. He has the the moral plight, the fourth vision of women getting out of their place, men getting out of their place. Man doesn't know what a man is. Woman doesn't know what a woman is. &gt;&gt; And and then it leads from there to moral decay. and and you have all of those visions coming to pass that the whole world is shaking. Friends, I I just want to say run to Christ. Run to the only thing that's solid. One day everything will shake, but there will be something that can't be shaken. And I want to say let me be in him that can't be shaken. A kingdom which can't be moved. &gt;&gt; Say, brother Matt, that's me. That's might be me. Might be a family member. Might be a friend. Might be someone I'm thinking of. How do we save our home one way in Acts 10 can save your house the same way Cornelia saved his in one single day one glorious miracle his entire house was saved and filled with the Holy Ghost and one day his situation was transformed from spiritual blind this man wasn't a a Jewish he wasn't a proelite he was didn't have any history. And then one day he transformed his home from spiritual blindness to light. God gave his house. They had a public Pentecost in Acts two, but Cornelius was going to have a private Pentecost in his own home. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the spirit of God, the same spirit that shook the church in Jerusalem was now going to shake Cornelius's home and and and opens the door for the Gentiles to receive the key that God gave to Peter. It was going to be the Gentiles entrance into the faith and the joint heir of Abraham's seed and Abraham's promises. All because one man determined in his heart to save his home. Can I just close by saying this? There are no shortcuts. &gt;&gt; There are no shortcuts to rebuilding your altar. &gt;&gt; There's no quick prayer. There's no quick fix. People love that. I do, too. But there is no quick fix. There's a God who can do things quick. I can I don't have time to even cover that. but dealing with a family a family longlost family member of mine and wanted his life was a wreck from alcohol and wanted this solution and my life's in chaos and he's crying and crying and crying and I said there's only one thing you can do and that's surrender your life to repent and as soon as I talked about repentance oh no I'm good I'm good I'm good I'm good yet his life was in shambles he wanted a quick fix he wanted the preacher to pray for him and it would be over you can't do that there's no shortcuts you got to come to repentance yourself, repair your altar, &gt;&gt; make a sacrifice unto God. What sacrifice? You &gt;&gt; present your body a living sacrifice, which is a your reasonable service. &gt;&gt; People want a quick shortcut. We spend as little of people, you know, you can get them here and my life's in chaos and my life's in distress and you don't owe much trouble and I don't feel like living. I don't feel like going on and I have no I have no, you know, drive and I have no motivation and my life's falling apart and I'm in so much trouble and and we can spend, you know, a whole afternoon talking about the trouble. But when you talk about how do we fix that? How how do we how do we how do we get back to the place to where there isn't disarray and chaos and strife and we don't we don't want the answer. We don't spend we want to spend as little time as possible weeping before the Lord. We don't want to fast pray fast and pray. Behold the face of the Lord. Cry out to God in desperation. No one wants that. Can I just say, friends, we're all guilty. We don't spend enough time before God's word, laying our lives down on the altar of God's word. We we spend a lot of time talking about our trouble. But how much time do we spend in prayer? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can I get a hearty amen here? We spend hours glued to television. You're glued to your television. We spend hours glued to our phones, hours doing this, hours at work, hours at the gym, hours at the sports, hours at the recreation, hours doing this. But how many hours do we spend laying before the Lord? &gt;&gt; Do we care about our altar? Is it in disrepair? or is it in disarray? Musicians, could you come? &gt;&gt; We spend so much time on that. We go to the Bible. Can I just keep on while they're coming? Spend so much time in in darkness and wonder why our homes are vexed by darkness. We go to the Bible just long enough. Listen, we go to the Bible just long enough to pick out a little special promise or memory verse or something we can pin down. Not against those things. It's just a name it and claim it. And it doesn't work. It's got to start by building an altar. It's more than an exercise of faith. It's more than a mental word game. The life of Cornelius proves that God wanted devotion. Listen to what the Bible says in Acts 10 of this man, certain man in Cesaria called Cornelius, a centurion of the band called the Italian man, a devout man, one who feared God with all of his house, which gave much arms to the people, and prayed to God always. When I say Cornelius prayed always and fasted, he prayed, he fasted, he waited on the Lord. Spent hours in prayer because why? He wanted to save his house. He was determined to save his home. &gt;&gt; He was determined not to neglect the things. Food became secondary. When you fast, food is secondary to you. There's one thing you want. Save my home, Lord. And whatever it takes. How many could bow your heads with me? Musicians, could you play something? Just bow your heads with me here this morning. Every head bowed, every eye closed. Build an altar. He was determined. Determined. He became so desperate to the point of neglecting natural food so he could seek God. How when's the last time you fasted? It's biblical. Yep. Prophet had a lot to say about it. Not preaching on that today. But let me just say that man should have put us all to shame. He had no teaching, no tapes, no table, no church, no sermons. He didn't have a teacher. Wasn't a Jewish proelite. He was simply a man who was desperate for God to save his house. He didn't even have the Holy Ghost yet. urging him and pulling on him to pray. Yet he fasted and prayed always. Let me just say to you, father, mother, young person, the man that prays, the person that prays, God hears. [Music] That's the answer. Not a quicky solution, not a quick one time, just a quick fix, but prayer is the only way to save our homes, solve our problems. [Music] I wonder if there'd be someone here under the sound of my voice just as we sing and worship the Lord, you maybe want to raise a hand, no one looking to say, "Lord, I want to repair my altar." Oh yes. Hands up everywhere. I want to repair it. Lord might be in disarray. I don't just want a good I love camp. I love experiences like that. But Lord, I want something that goes beyond that echoes beyond a a good weekend of services. Something that changes me on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. A living fire ever burning bright with passion, with zeal, with worship that comes from the heart, not from the music. Oh, could you stand with your hands raised and say, "Lord, bring me back." Hands up everywhere. Keep them up. Bring me back to the heart of worship, Lord. When it's all about you. It's all about you. Here's my yes, Lord. I'm going to give it today. Here's my yes. Here's the zeal of thine house. I got it raised. Zeal of thine house. The temple of the Lord is eating me up. I don't want an uncsured heart. Here's a fully surrendered heart. I'm raising it up before you, God, right now. I'm raising it up before you, Jesus. A full surrender. A full surrendered heart. Yes, Lord. That's my desire. And brother Donnie preached on Sunday about proving his word. God will come and prove it. Bring all your needs to the altar. Raise your hands and sing now. Bring all your needs to the Lord. He is so willing and able to help you. Bring all bring all your needs to the Lord. Raise it up now. Raise those hands home. Bring all your needs to the altar. Oh, bring all your needs to the Lord. [Music] Oh, oh, he is so willing and aable to help you. Oh, bring all your needs to. Oh, that sounds beautiful. Sing it again now. Oh, bring all your needs to the altar. Oh yes, Lord. Yes, Jesus. Your needs. Oh yes, Lord Jesus. I'm bringing them now. Oh, he is so willing, so able, able to help you. Oh, bring all. One more time before we go. The Lord, if you got a need, just raise it up now. Oh, bring all your needs to the altar. Oh, bring all your needs to the Lord. [Music] For he is so willing and able to help you bring all your needs to the Lord. I'm coming back to the heart of worship. Can we sing that, brother Ander? Go ahead. &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. &gt;&gt; I would remiss if I did not say something at this juncture. Okay. &gt;&gt; So, you know, anytime that you have uh a ship uh crossing the ocean, it doesn't matter how big the ship is or how fancy the boat is. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Or how many passengers are on the ship or how many crew members are on the ship or how hard the crew members work or are dedicated to the ship. If you don't have a captain on the ship, the ship will never successfully arrive at the destination. And anytime that you do something on the scale um of this youth camp that we have, uh if you don't have a captain, this would never be possible. And um it's the responsibility of that captain on that ship. He has all of the weight and all of the responsibility of every decision that is made on that ship. And if anything goes wrong or anything happens, the captain is responsible for that. And he's the one that has to decide when to slow down. or when to navigate through the storm in order to arrive at the other side successfully. And I just I just wonder if we can all give a big round of applause to brother Matt Watkins for this camp because without him none of this would have been possible no matter who was had whatever they were doing. Brother Matt, thank you very much. Thank you for that. Amen. They were texting me. You forgot about yourself. No, I didn't. I'm nobody. I'm just just a part of the part of what God's doing. Aren't you glad to be part of that? &gt;&gt; Amen. Why don't you just um sing this song with me as we go? Oh, I love this. Maybe just one time before we leave, then we'll have you be dismissed. When the music fades, all is stripped away and I simply come. &gt;&gt; Oh, longing just to bring something &gt;&gt; that will bless &gt;&gt; bless your heart. I'll bring you more. I'll bring you more than a song. For a song is is not what you have required. You search much deeper. You search much deeper within. Through the way through the way things are. You're looking into my heart. I'm coming back to the heart of worship. And it's all about you. It's all about you, Jesus. I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I made it. When it's all about you. Oh, it's all about you. Sing that again. I'm coming. I'm coming back to the heart of worship. Tell him it's all about you. Oh, it's all about you, Jesus. And I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it. When it's all about you. Oh, it's all about you, Jesus. King of endless world. [Music] No one could express how much you deserve. [Music] Though I'm weak and poor. Oh, though I'm weak and full. All I have is yours. Every single bread. I'll bring you more. I'll bring you more than a song. Yes, Lord. For a song in itself is not what you have required. You search my You search much deeper within. Oh, through the way things are. You're looking into my heart. Oh, I'm coming back to the heart of Yes, Lord. Oh, where it's all about. Tell him that this morning. It's all about you. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I made it. When it's all about you. Oh, it's all about I'm coming back home. I'm coming back to the heart of God bless you, friends. You can be dismissed. We'll see you Wednesday night. Keep our pastor in prayer as you go. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Lord. Think I've made it all about you. [Music] All about you, Jesus. [Applause] [Music] Lord of worship. All about you. All about you, Jesus. [Music] You want [Music] It's all about you, Jesus. [Music] in me clean heart. [Music]
