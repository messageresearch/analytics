TRANSCRIPT
========================================
to be in the house of the Lord. Uh if we could just stand and open up with a word of prayer. Heavenly Father, we just come before you, Lord. Now, we thank you for this day. Father, we are always so grateful to be able to come into the house of the Lord and be able to learn of you, Lord Jesus. Father, we just Lord, remember that Father and all things, Lord, we can learn of you, Lord, for Father, we have many burdens upon our heart, Lord, but you can of all those things, Lord, just a moment in your presence, Father. May you just come and saturate us today, Lord, from this Sunday school lesson to the Lord, ministry of music, to the ministry of the word. May you speak to our hearts, Lord Jesus. We just lay aside all those weights, Father, the besetting things that Lord may be hindrances to us, Father. Lord, may none of us be a hindrance to the service today, Lord. Help us just to be able to, Lord, just find your mind for the word. Lord, may you just help move me out of the way, Father. You, Lord, see the thought that you laid upon my heart. May you just open it up to your people. Lord, just this teaching, this Lord, this lesson, Father, may it just speak to the hearts of these believers this morning, Father. May you open up our hearts and our minds to receive from you. May you quiet our spirit, Lord. May you just forgive us of our shortcomings and our sins, Lord, and our failures. We want to remember and thank you for all that you are doing in our lives, Lord Jesus, currently. We love you and we ask it all in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you. Go ahead and turn in your Bibles to Luke chapter 10. We're going to read just four verses of scripture. Luke chapter 10 and verse 38 over here. Luke 10 and 38. It says, "Now it came to pass as they went that he entered into a certain village, and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house. And she had a sister called Mary, which also sat at Jesus's feet, and heard his word. But ma Martha was cumbered about much serving, and came to him, and said, Lord, dust thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone? Bid her therefore that she help me? And Jesus answered and said unto her, Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things, but one thing is needful, and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her. I bless you as you take your seats this morning. Just have a really simple thought, a simple lesson if that's all right. I was reading this story in the gospels and it just some things just were opening up in my heart and I just want to break it down and grab a few things from it this morning as the Lord was dealing with me on it. So there in this in this story, Jesus visits this place and he begins to teach in this home. And here's Martha, you know, one of the sisters of Lazarus, and she's doing what she normally would be doing, right? She's just busy working, tending to the needs of the house. But Mary, her sister, in this instance, she recognized that there was an opportunity. So she laid aside everything that she was doing and she was just sitting at the feet of Jesus, you know, just hungry to hear the word. And Martha, she became so flustered and frustrated at the situation. And she was actually she was upset that that Mary wasn't helping her and and even angry that she was the only one that was doing any of the work. And she became so troubled at that that she actually says to Jesus, "Lord, don't you care that my sister has left me here to do all the work, you know, tell her to tell her to help me." And Jesus just replies so simply, just a gentle rebuke. The Lord's good at that. Gently rebuking us. Amen. And he just said, "Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things, but one thing is needful, and Mary hath chosen the good part, which shall not be taken away from us." And I thought about how uh often we can any of us can suffer from Martha's condition. You know, we get so busy going and doing that we miss the most important thing and that's just being in the presence of the Lord. Mary in this instance, you know, like I was saying, she was able to slow down and and put tasks aside and and just saturate herself in the presence of the Lord. Something that sticks out to me is is, you know, Mary, she wasn't so concerned with Martha and what she was doing, but on the other side, Martha was overwhelmingly concerned with Mary's condition. You know, I know I'm just going to take some simple things from this. Um, and yet Jesus discerned in that that Martha was the one that was troubled. Right? So, I want to get into this in a little in a few minutes, but but my desire and our desire should be to be in Mary's condition. Amen. And and there's a balance in this. You know, we don't we don't want to be so overly concerned with someone's else someone else's condition and someone else's position. And yet, we're not even in the place that we need to be in. &gt;&gt; Amen. The the Lord Jesus himself, the king of the world, was in her house. Yet, she wasn't even in the same room as him. and her sister was. And you know, I I was telling Joy extrapolating a lot from this, but it's just how the Lord dealt with me. Um, you know, and I'm not saying don't be concerned with other people's spiritual walks. You know, I believe we ought to pray for our brothers and our sisters and and um you know, especially if you if you recognize that there's clear struggles in their life, you know, we ought to pray for them. We ought to bear each other's burdens. We ought to lift them up in prayer. We ought to go to that brother, that sister, help them out in any way we can. Um, but we ought to be more concerned with our own spiritual walk. Amen. Before we go pointing fingers at our brother, our sister. Um, you know, how's that saying go? It says, you know, one finger pointed out is three fingers pointed in, right? So, you know, not my brother, not my sister, but me, oh Lord, that's that's just standing in the need of prayer. It's important not invaluable time examining anyone else's spiritual condition when we need to be focused on what the Lord has for us. Amen. Because it's not going to cause any growth in your life when you're focused on someone else's condition and someone else's position. Now, there's again there's a balance in that. You know, fathers and mothers, we we are concerned with our wives and our our our children and our and our husbands and and I get that. But you know in a in the spiritual side of things when it comes to the individual affair with the Lord Jesus Christ we are to be more concerned with us than than them. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because it is an individual affair. Um, one of the most uh valuable lessons, you know, in the story is just a simple fact that you can grow that we grow and we can grow and learn the most when we're just sitting at the feet of Jesus spending time in his presence, you know, when you're just closing off your mind to the world. Um, you know, being in a condition like Martha was in, it can really cause cause you to be blinded to spiritual matters because when your focus is so natural and so earthly, you know, you're not even able to to to see what the Lord wants you to see, you're you're closed off to spiritual matters. And we live in a time where where we're so busy all the time and it's go go go. But as believers, it's it's just vital that we set us we set aside time in our day and set aside time in our week where we can shut the world down &gt;&gt; and and the world around us. And it not not just church. Amen. It's not just it can't it can't be just something playing in the background either. It's got to be a communion with the Lord because it'll be those times that the Lord can actually minister to you. You know, you can actually go to church and still be in Martha's condition. &gt;&gt; You can actually be listening to a message and still be in Martha's condition. You can actually be reading your Bible. You can actually be doing the things that that you need to be doing and still be in Martha's condition because there is a there is an atmosphere that you create around yourself. And when you don't separate yourself from the world for a moment because we are in this world, but we're not of this world, we have to create an atmosphere around us so that the Lord can actually be in our presence. Amen. And that we can be in his and that's where we're going to do the most growing and do the most learning. Amen. Um you know, you're off in another place. Even if you're present, even if you're there, you're not present. Amen. And there's a difference. Um, you know, Mary and Martha were in the same house, yet they were a million miles away from each other in in just this in this simple story. Um, you can keep a wall up to the Lord to be able to come in and take away your troubles and minister to your needs. You know, when he when he told Martha that that Mary had chosen the better way, he wasn't saying that Mary was somehow superior because she had done that. He was offering her the answer to her problem. I know that's simple, but the Lord isn't the author of confusion. He works in simple ways to fix complex problems. Amen. And many times he already has a solution to whatever problem that you're facing or whatever question you have. Um but somehow as humans we just make it more complex sometimes than it needs to be. You know, the Lord works in in simple ways. Amen. If you have a question in your heart, he has the answer. If you have a need, he has a solution. You step into his presence and you let down your guard. And you know, I'm sure Mary had to fight against some of her own self so that she could sit there, you know, and and listen to the Lord. You know, you have to fight against yourself because we have a nature and our nature just tends to to be busy and it tends to be thinking about other things and it tends so it's an active process and I've said that here before. It's an active process that it takes for you to be here and to be present here or to be in fellowship with the Lord. It's an active process to set aside your thoughts, to lay aside those things, and to let the Lord come and minister to you, you know, and and Mary, she was just as as human as Martha, she probably had as just as many problems as as she did, but she wasn't the one pointing fingers in this story. Um, you know, when we we we go to start pointing fingers at other people, but we ought to put the microscope on our own lives first. Amen. something that can also happen um when we're trying so hard to do something or to attain something by our own works. Even if in those things our intention is to please the Lord, we can often miss the mark alto together. Amen. Because you know you you could you could read the Bible from cover to cover but the Lord has to give you the revelation of Jesus. The Lord has to reveal these things to you. So, it takes more than just words on a page. It takes it to become a reality in your life. You have to let the Lord open it up to you. Um Martha, you know, even though I was, like I was saying, she had the right intention and was trying to do a service for the Lord, right intentions can sometimes lead us astray. You know, I don't know how that saying goes. Paved road to intentions of a paved road or lead you to hell or something like that. I'm not sure how that goes. um right intentions can lead us astray oftent times because in our heart we think we're doing what's right. But the Lord didn't need her to do that. He needed her to do something else. So we have to be able to discern what the Lord has for us right now. Um you know and and uh another thing I wanted to look at from this from this story, you know, Mary, I'm sure had a little bit of discernment to know that her sister wasn't exactly happy with what she was doing, right? used to read between the lines. You know, when we live with someone, we're around that person all the time. You can pick up on things, you know, maybe other people wouldn't exactly pick up on. You catch your feelings um in matters before they express it. You catch how they feel about it. You know, you you see it in their reactions. You see it in their face. So, you you know their facial expressions. You know, when they're upset, you can just read that person. But one thing, you know, that you notice that that didn't hinder her decision to stay in her position. Amen. at the feet of the Lord and continue to do what she's doing. And just pulling something out of that, I thought this this meant a lot to me because how often times do people base what they do on how others are responding, right? Really think about that for a minute because pressure is a real thing, right? Even in even in church, we can't let another person's reactions or their feelings be the driving force in our decisions, right? Because if you're not careful, that person's feelings or that person's reaction, you know, their hindrances in this case, they can influence your actions. And by that pressure, it can actually have a serious negative effect in your life and become your hindrance. Their hindrance now has become your hindrance because you have let the effect of whatever emotion they're feeling come upon you. You know, that's that's pressure. You know, it's just a it's pressure. And to unpack that, we can't let um other act other people's actions, it it can't be the driving force in any decisions that you make. Amen. You know, and there's there's a discomfort in that sometimes when you're in a situation where it's uncomfortable, but the gospel isn't here to please everybody, you know. It's it's it's here to wash you clean. It's here to get you right in right standing with the Lord. It's here to it's here to change you, right? So sometimes there's going to be uncomfortable situations. You're going to find yourself where you have to say or do something to rid yourself of a situation and you may be able to read that that person is uncomfortable. But that's okay. You know, I'm here to have the Lord change me. I'm not here because you you're feeling a certain type of way. Amen. &gt;&gt; Martha, you know, she was under this certain type of pressure and that she had to do something, that she had to be something. And Jesus caught that in her spirit and said, "Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things. Her sister's thought didn't become her own thought." So, she didn't let that negatively influence her. And and you know, um something here that the people that are closest to us, they are most times the most and of course this is just natural, they're the most influential in your life. And that can be positive or it can be negative. Amen. So you have to uh I thought that was just an important point because when when the Lord is trying to deal with you individually, the the enemy always has a way about bringing something negative to discourage you, right? Or to to try to distract you from whatever it is that the Lord's dealing dealing with you in your life or to get you focused on on something else. You know, if there's if there's something spiritually po positive happening in your life, you rest assured that the the devil has an active plan to hinder it. Amen. And um I'm just I'm glad that there's a there's a way to to fight against that. Amen. To stay close to the presence of the Lord, to allow him to continue to change us. And just recognize, I know this is just simple thought this morning, but just to be able to recognize that when you're in the house of the Lord or when you're you have an opportunity to be in his presence, don't let things negatively influence you. Don't let pure pressure influence you. Just let the Lord deal with you in whatever way he's going to deal with you because God is he's Matt talk about that. God is a God of variety. He might deal with you differently than he deals with you. He might deal with you differently. He's He got a hold of my life and he's going to get a hold of your life, but he might do that in a different way. And you know, just let the Lord be who he is. Amen. And recognize that wherever you're at, whatever you're doing, the enemy is always going to try to try to distract you from it. But just fight through that and just let the Lord just continue to to change it. Amen. Let's just pray. Heavenly Father, we just thank you for this day. We thank you for your word. Lord, we just ask that you could just come and Lord speak to us through the ministering of your word. Lord, help us today just to Father overcome ourselves and and and just hear from you. Lord, we love you and we ask it in Jesus name. Amen.
