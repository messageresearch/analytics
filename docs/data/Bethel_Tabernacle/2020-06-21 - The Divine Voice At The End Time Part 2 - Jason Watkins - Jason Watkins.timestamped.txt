[37:11] something just led me to just saying a
[37:13] little bit of mercy rewrote my life as
[37:15] brother Jason mercy
[37:21] [Music]
[37:32] versus we rolled by
[37:42] I should have fallen by soul
[37:49] cast down but mercy rewrote my
[38:00] oh it was mercy that re-rolled milah it
[38:13] was the person
[38:16] [Music]
[38:22] I should warn you my soul pastime
[38:34] but mercy re-roll
[38:42] [Music]
[38:45] hallelujah you love the Lord praise God
[38:49] we're glad to have you here in the house
[38:51] of the Lord today amen while we're still
[38:54] gathering under our self-imposed
[38:58] restrictions you can be seated
[38:59] momentarily I just want to make a few
[39:01] announcements before we dismiss the
[39:04] musicians want everybody to be able to
[39:06] hear it we've got a you know a
[39:17] unsettling time in the world right now
[39:19] and you know there it looked like maybe
[39:23] that we kind of had things going in the
[39:26] right direction and I know what the
[39:28] political climate that's active right
[39:32] now it's going to keep going forward and
[39:34] I'm not so much concerned about that I
[39:36] think things will continue to open up
[39:40] and I don't I really don't have any not
[39:44] any way to know you know what governors
[39:46] will do individually our governor has
[39:50] been somewhat conservative you know and
[39:53] kind of even when they were originally
[39:55] shutting things down he was very
[39:57] reticent to do that I I know that from
[40:00] the federal standpoint from the White
[40:02] House they want everything to go forward
[40:04] but they can't always make that happen
[40:07] state to state so we don't know what's
[40:09] going to happen exactly going forward
[40:11] here in South Carolina but there there
[40:15] definitely has been a spike both in
[40:19] testing which has spiked positive tests
[40:25] coming back because they're testing so
[40:27] much more but they're also as a margin
[40:30] of that and what I can't determine is
[40:31] the exact margin nobody seems to be
[40:33] separating it out how much of that is
[40:35] hospitalizations which is the real
[40:37] number that's the one - you've got to be
[40:41] cognizant of because if people are is
[40:44] testing positive then that doesn't mean
[40:49] that they're even presenting any
[40:49] symptoms I was just reading today or my
[40:52] wife was actually catching me up on it
[40:56] that you know South Carolina just set a
[40:59] new record in this kovat environment
[41:02] over the last you know since the spring
[41:04] I think yesterday was our largest day of
[41:07] new confirmed cases but that's largely
[41:11] because of increased testing which is a
[41:15] good thing I had it suggested to me by a
[41:18] good brother as a medical provider that
[41:21] it's it's possible that we all will
[41:25] eventually come in contact with the
[41:27] corona virus maybe many of us already
[41:28] have and don't even know it
[41:31] that's I would say that's probable so
[41:36] but but but you know I did I was able to
[41:40] get an update concerning our local
[41:43] hospital that they are pretty much
[41:47] running to capacity ICU and regular beds
[41:51] are getting rare and they're having to
[41:55] really you know labor to get patients
[41:58] admitted and they have had a few
[42:00] increased or some increase in covent
[42:05] hospitalizations so there's no doubt
[42:09] that the very much expected second wave
[42:14] probably is underway I think that
[42:16] there's a little doubt of that myself
[42:17] personally you see the trend happening
[42:20] in China and Beijing is actually
[42:21] shutting down again and so these kinds
[42:23] of things are going on so what I can
[42:27] report to you is that I was just in
[42:30] North Carolina and there's two or three
[42:32] churches up there that have had to close
[42:34] because their assemblies became infected
[42:37] with the corona virus and I the only
[42:43] serious case that I've heard about which
[42:46] actually he's now on the mend and
[42:48] improving his brother is pastor Tim
[42:50] Hayden there in North Carolina
[42:52] he caught it several members of the
[42:54] church caught it there's several other
[42:56] churches that have shuttered because it
[42:58] hit in their assemblies the word I got
[43:01] is everybody's doing fine but the Tim
[43:04] really got pretty sick but you know
[43:06] disliked with our own
[43:08] Charles prayer prayer changes everything
[43:10] and so you know brother Tim is on is
[43:14] mending and the last word I got this
[43:17] morning even from brother Jason work is
[43:19] he's starting to recover but we want to
[43:21] hold him in prayer told him we would and
[43:23] this the Lord would keep strengthening
[43:25] him several churches you know we've
[43:31] certainly found out contrary to false
[43:36] understanding that you know we couldn't
[43:38] possibly catch the kovat virus because
[43:41] it was a tribulation plague well that
[43:43] was never true and I'm you know I'm glad
[43:46] we never taught that from here we have
[43:49] followed a path of prudence I'm not at
[43:52] all afraid I haven't operated in fear at
[43:54] all I know the Lord my life and time and
[43:57] your life and time is in his hands and
[43:59] so you know if I was gonna operate in
[44:02] fear I'd certainly kept my family home
[44:05] certainly would have kept my mom home at
[44:07] her age but you know I've not operated
[44:11] in fear I haven't felt afraid I
[44:12] encourage you to not be afraid but it's
[44:15] not a matter of fear versus faith
[44:18] it's about prudence and wisdom and so
[44:22] that's really how I have tried to
[44:25] operate before the Lord several churches
[44:27] in the message around have now gone back
[44:30] to their streaming only I think Happy
[44:35] Valley is now going back that one that I
[44:37] know of I think maybe in the Phoenix
[44:40] church has also gone back to
[44:42] internet-only where they have this like
[44:44] we did for awhile skeleton crew of just
[44:47] some musicians of worship leader and a
[44:51] skeleton booth crew just and we
[44:55] distrained it I I I don't feel to do
[45:00] that just yet to go back to that if I do
[45:05] go back it will be to that we will
[45:07] continue to meet here and preach the
[45:09] gospel to you and if we have to do that
[45:12] I would encourage you heavily catch
[45:16] every service if your home today
[45:18] streaming let me just say to the
[45:20] audience who aren't allowed
[45:21] to be here today if your home streaming
[45:24] and you haven't been faithful to catch
[45:26] every service go back and get them well
[45:29] you make sure you catch all of them
[45:30] because every word that's being spoken
[45:33] to the bride now is of vital vital vital
[45:38] importance things are happening at an
[45:42] alarming pace that are happening in the
[45:44] world that we've never seen the
[45:46] conglomeration of we've never seen it as
[45:48] a whole as I said to you sometime
[45:50] weeks ago that it's not that things are
[45:53] happening in the world judgment signs
[45:55] it's not that we haven't seen them
[45:57] before it's that we've never seen them
[45:59] all happening at the same time before
[46:00] and truly friends the coming of the Lord
[46:05] would have to be nearby every metric any
[46:09] measurable standard you'd want to use
[46:11] you have to conclude that there is no
[46:14] eighth age there's not another age
[46:16] coming there's no more messengers God
[46:18] only had seven he deployed his last one
[46:20] a half-century ago the the the Israel's
[46:24] back in their homeland Moses and Elijah
[46:26] are ready to come on the scene if for no
[46:28] other reason than that alone Moses
[46:32] Elijah can't enter the field until we
[46:34] clear the field so the coming of the
[46:38] Lord is soon you want to make sure that
[46:42] everything is buttoned up tight in your
[46:45] heart your life this is no time to play
[46:48] loose you know with your experience this
[46:51] is time to make your calling and
[46:52] election sure this is time to lay aside
[46:55] if you were ever going to take a time to
[46:57] lay aside every weight and sin that does
[47:00] so easily more easily than you'd want to
[47:02] admit beset you this is the time so you
[47:07] know right now we're meeting using 50%
[47:10] of the alphabet and then I'm always open
[47:13] to letting families we've relaxed even
[47:16] that a little bit we've added in that
[47:18] anyone that's on duty as far as any of
[47:21] the offices are concerned if they're on
[47:22] duty their families welcome to attend
[47:24] with them I like to keep families
[47:26] together I don't want to see them broke
[47:27] up just because we're you know splitting
[47:30] up the alphabet like that others who
[47:32] travel at distance are always allowed to
[47:34] come
[47:35] and then I occasionally get nearly every
[47:37] weekend I'll get at least one special
[47:38] request for the Jason for such-and-such
[47:41] a reason can I
[47:42] I'm not scheduled I'm not on the list
[47:43] but could I come yes I always say yes
[47:45] happy to have you and so we're going to
[47:50] carry on with that but just bear in mind
[47:53] I'm watching it I just wanted to
[47:55] normally I've been sending out a letter
[47:59] to you and I haven't done that with this
[48:02] one but I just kind of wanted to give it
[48:04] to you verbally and while everyone is
[48:06] watching that I am I am keeping close
[48:10] tabs with the municipalities the
[48:14] government the hospitals our own team of
[48:18] doctors we have here their inside
[48:20] information on it and so we are watching
[48:24] that very closely we're moving very
[48:27] prudently if we decide to go back
[48:30] temporarily to just a video crew and
[48:34] worship team I'll make sure to let you
[48:37] know in plenty enough time I'm sure by
[48:40] now you're able to keep up with the
[48:41] alphabet when you're signed I don't I've
[48:43] not been continuing to send that out
[48:46] I think everybody's got that figured out
[48:48] by now after today one one one thing
[48:54] that I am going to do I I contemplated
[48:57] two additional steps I've decided to not
[49:02] do one but to apply the other I was
[49:06] going to suspend our Sunday school class
[49:08] just to limit the amount of time that
[49:13] we're together because that's a factor
[49:14] one of the reasons that we're that we
[49:18] have a low risk is because we're only
[49:19] here for a couple hours and it's in a
[49:21] small group and you know you we gather
[49:24] in families and so we keep families
[49:26] seated together and even if we have you
[49:29] shake hands it's usually family to
[49:31] family so you know you want to be still
[49:33] be vigilant outside we want to be very
[49:36] careful remember friends we're still
[49:37] we're still got a testimony to protect
[49:41] all right when you go out front and you
[49:44] congregate like like it there's no
[49:46] problem that people see that
[49:48] so just be careful you know if you want
[49:50] to stand out in congregate intentionally
[49:52] have a little bit of distance I don't
[49:54] I'm not worried about six feet the World
[49:56] Health Organization has never said it
[49:58] needed to be more than three feet so you
[50:01] know just try to at least have some
[50:04] semblance of distancing because we want
[50:07] you to fellowship I know you love each
[50:09] other and you want to see till I get it
[50:10] I love coming to church for that reason
[50:13] as well and so we're going to continue
[50:15] with the Sunday School class I just felt
[50:18] like I didn't want to lay that down I
[50:20] want to keep it going but concerning the
[50:24] fellowship hall after today now not
[50:27] counting today because some of you may
[50:28] have come with prepared food expecting
[50:31] to eat in the fellowship hall if you are
[50:33] be my guest
[50:34] but after today to the Deacons I'd like
[50:37] to keep that close please until further
[50:40] notice in the afternoons I hate to do
[50:42] that because I really really really
[50:44] really really did I say really I really
[50:47] enjoy that fellowship in the fellowship
[50:49] oh man you people are so awesome I so
[50:53] enjoy sitting out there drinking coffee
[50:54] and talking about the things of God or
[50:57] just talking about how you been Amen so
[51:00] it's just a wonderful weave it's a
[51:02] little bit of a little bit of seasoning
[51:04] on our church that is rare people that
[51:08] visit here say wow I've never seen
[51:09] things like this where y'all just seem
[51:12] to come out here in the pastor and his
[51:13] wife jumps right in the big middle and
[51:15] y'all just all like one big family I
[51:16] won't yeah that's my design we like it
[51:19] like that
[51:20] so you know people who tend to be
[51:24] islands to themselves don't usually last
[51:25] here at Bethel Tabernacle because we
[51:27] like to be one big happy family
[51:29] amen and we like people included anytime
[51:33] we have an event
[51:34] I don't want most people there I want
[51:36] everybody there it's just how I'm
[51:38] natured I've had to learn to press
[51:40] through that sometimes and I get that
[51:42] not everybody can be as amazing as me
[51:45] and so I should have said that oh well
[51:51] just wanted to loosen you up just a
[51:54] little bit you just all staring at me
[51:56] like oh no so until further notice not
[51:59] counting today if you've come
[52:01] today preparing to stay a fellowship all

[52:09] problems he's been having in her
[52:11] intestine and stomach but then she's
[52:14] also having some side effects from
[52:16] medication today intestine Elysee so
[52:19] just keep her in prayer and myself as
[52:22] well so we just come back from North
[52:24] Carolina for a few days visiting and did
[52:27] some visiting and ministering while we
[52:29] were there with the family and so I'm
[52:33] from the trip I'm a little bit tired so
[52:35] I'll probably head back home today after
[52:36] service but god bless you if you're
[52:39] planning to stay around and fellowship
[52:40] but after this Sunday we won't have the
[52:43] fellowship hall open until further
[52:45] notice and we will continue with Sunday
[52:47] school and we will continue to meet
[52:49] using half the alphabet and granting
[52:52] anyone special request I'm sure I will
[52:55] continue to do that as well let's stand
[52:57] back up god bless you we want to
[52:59] remember to pray for brother Tim Hayden
[53:03] that the Lord will continue you know
[53:06] friends we're gonna have to have faith I
[53:08] mean you're you're at the day where
[53:11] faith is going to be an imperative
[53:14] you're not going to be able to go a day
[53:17] and it's only going to get more and more
[53:19] imperative till it becomes so essential
[53:21] that you dare not face a day without
[53:24] strong settled faith in your heart there
[53:27] are there are there are things listen
[53:30] for sure for sure for sure I can tell
[53:33] you thus say at the Prophet under the
[53:36] inspiration of God things will get worse
[53:38] they must get worse they cannot get
[53:42] better they must get worse even if we
[53:46] have periods that seem to be respite and
[53:48] quiet understand it's just the next wave
[53:51] is just almost coming we're either
[53:53] coming out of 1 in 1 or about to go in 1
[53:56] the world as we know it is coming to a
[53:59] conclusion the Bible describes the the
[54:02] system of man in the world as it's old
[54:06] like a garment that's old and more out
[54:07] it's ready to be wrapped up it needs a
[54:10] new one
[54:12] we need new bodies amen
[54:15] so I know that we're we're going to have
[54:18] that soon you're going to have to have
[54:19] faith there's things that the doctors
[54:21] will not have answers for we have beyond
[54:27] measure the most sincere of heart and
[54:30] dedicated medical care givers in this
[54:34] assembly that you could ever hope for
[54:36] they will face things increasingly they
[54:39] have no medical solutions for I'm glad
[54:42] that patients who go to see them are
[54:44] going to see a praying caregiver a care
[54:47] giver who can lay hands on them and the
[54:49] patient might not even know they're
[54:51] being prayed for amen
[54:54] I know that they do that they've told me
[54:56] you know brother Branham my sister sent
[54:59] me this quote I'd I don't ever remember
[55:02] reading it though I've heard this
[55:03] message make the valley full of ditches
[55:05] and brother branham's got a man in a
[55:07] discernment line and he says this is
[55:11] this is odd doc Meredith listen to this
[55:13] he says brother madam starts seeing a
[55:15] vision talking about waters running on
[55:17] the road or something like that isn't
[55:19] that right
[55:20] and he says they speaking of the doctors
[55:23] they can't understand here it is brother
[55:25] Branham says it's caused from a nervous
[55:28] condition it's putting water in your
[55:30] lungs Wow and it's caused from a nervous
[55:36] it's not a disease it's an affliction of
[55:38] his mind
[55:39] and that's the that's the chief devil in
[55:42] this age madness in the mind and he says
[55:46] it's coming from a nervous condition
[55:48] it's putting forth water in your lungs
[55:51] now listen to what he says that's a
[55:54] demon power that a doctor would never
[55:56] find in the world I'm gonna tell you
[56:00] something friends we're gonna need this
[56:02] kind of God among us we're gonna need
[56:05] this kind of God among us I don't need
[56:07] the Prophet to come back from the dead
[56:09] to bring me back the same God that led
[56:11] him is here same pillar fires here amen
[56:16] all right praise the Lord
[56:18] e 1st Thessalonians 5 this morning
[56:24] first Thessalonians 5 and we're going to
[56:27] begin at verse 1 I apologize
[56:34] brothers in the booth for not getting
[56:36] you that scripture I try to get that to
[56:38] you and I I didn't have my mind made up
[56:41] until right before I came out so if
[56:43] you'll find that for me thank you
[56:45] 1st Thessalonians 5 we want to continue
[56:48] today on a divine voice before the end
[56:51] time
[56:52] part 2 divine voice before the end I
[56:56] think is what I titled it I think we
[56:59] proved that last time we were here that
[57:02] the world will hear once again from God
[57:05] direct a man as at Pentecost how did
[57:09] they hear direct from God direct from
[57:12] God direct God didn't step out on a
[57:14] cloud and start preaching but they heard
[57:18] direct from him he didn't come down and
[57:21] throw his voice around the earth and
[57:24] everybody heard it speaking he had done
[57:26] that in the gospel era when Jesus was
[57:29] walking in God's the Father spoke to him
[57:31] and people said that sound like thunder
[57:32] somebody said that was a voice of God
[57:34] and Jesus called it a voice so this
[57:36] voice came not for your sakes but mine
[57:38] are my sake but for yours and so God had
[57:40] done that he'd been known to do that but
[57:43] that's not how the world heard direct
[57:46] direct not indirectly that's an amazing
[57:49] statement not indirectly but directly as
[57:53] at Pentecost
[57:55] you know how it was through the body
[57:58] through the body God through his church
[58:02] the world heard direct from God they had
[58:06] thus saith the Lord whenever you are
[58:10] speaking thus saith the Lord
[58:12] it doesn't matter if you're William
[58:14] Branham or Don gurgel or Travis Jackson
[58:17] it doesn't matter who you are if it
[58:21] might be seal Carter it doesn't matter
[58:23] who you are if you're speaking thus
[58:26] saith the Lord
[58:27] that person is hearing not indirectly
[58:29] directly from God
[58:32] doesn't make seal Christ it doesn't make
[58:35] dawn or Travis or william branham christ
[58:38] doesn't make him Jesus but the people
[58:41] did here direct from God through the
[58:44] voice of a man but he's still just a man
[58:46] right all right now
[58:51] 1st Thessalonians 5 verse 1 but over the
[58:59] times and seasons brethren you have no
[59:02] need that I write unto you for
[59:04] yourselves know perfectly that the day
[59:06] of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the
[59:09] night for when they now notice this
[59:12] isn't you is not the church this is they
[59:15] when they shall say peace and safety
[59:19] then sudden destruction cometh upon who
[59:24] not you you're not the one running
[59:28] around crying peace and safety because
[59:31] peace and safety is a lie the world is
[59:35] in upheaval and the the age of mankind
[59:41] in a fallen condition is ending thank
[59:45] God as travail upon a woman with child
[59:50] and they shall not escape do you know
[59:54] how every by the way happy Father's Day
[59:58] brothers god bless you I thought of that
[1:00:02] because I want to think of mothers do
[1:00:03] you know how that every single mother in
[1:00:08] this building knows that the rapture
[1:00:12] must come it can't just keep going
[1:00:15] because they've given birth and they
[1:00:19] went into labor and sometimes it was a
[1:00:21] long and it was hard and it was painful
[1:00:24] and they agonized but finally it was
[1:00:30] inevitable it couldn't not happen once
[1:00:36] they went into labor sister Debbie she
[1:00:40] went into labor and she was crying and
[1:00:42] we were at hospital she said
[1:00:44] I don't wanna do this I just want to go
[1:00:46] home I don't wanna do this other honey I
[1:00:47] don't think it works like that your your
[1:00:51] you're nine months and you're in labor
[1:00:53] I'm pretty sure we're going forward when
[1:00:59] they shall say peace and safety then
[1:01:01] sudden destruction cometh upon them as
[1:01:03] travail upon a woman with child and they
[1:01:05] shall not escape but ye now look at him
[1:01:09] draw the line in the sand but ye
[1:01:11] brethren are not in darkness that that
[1:01:13] day should overtake you as a thief ye
[1:01:16] are all the children of light and the
[1:01:18] children of the day we are not of the
[1:01:21] night nor of darkness
[1:01:23] therefore for this cause for that reason
[1:01:27] having said what I said because of this
[1:01:30] because of this let us not sleep as do
[1:01:36] others but let us watch and be sober
[1:01:41] we're the only ones who will we're the
[1:01:44] only ones who can you know why because
[1:01:46] we're the only ones who know what to
[1:01:47] really look for for they that's not you
[1:01:52] that sleep in the night and they that be
[1:01:55] drunken are drunken in the night but let
[1:01:58] us who are of the day be sober putting
[1:02:02] on this is a proactive putting on the
[1:02:06] breastplate of faith on love for a
[1:02:10] helmet putting on a helmet putting on
[1:02:12] hope of salvation for God hath not
[1:02:16] appointed elected predestinated
[1:02:20] determined for us to have wrath but to
[1:02:24] obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus
[1:02:28] Christ who died for us that whether we
[1:02:33] wake or sleep we should live together
[1:02:36] with him wherefore comfort yourselves
[1:02:41] together and edify one another even as
[1:02:46] also you do not a beautiful passage may
[1:02:52] the Lord bless the reading of his let's
[1:02:54] pray I want to pray for brother Tim
[1:02:55] father we're asking prayer over your
[1:02:58] word today over this service asking
[1:03:00] prayer for brother Tim Hayden Lord I
[1:03:02] pray you will continue to strengthen him
[1:03:04] in all the saints there may be sick
[1:03:06] Lord may you just bring them completely
[1:03:07] back to perfect health watch over us now
[1:03:10] today keep us keep us under your care
[1:03:13] and under your leadership above all
[1:03:14] things Lord in Jesus name Amen god bless
[1:03:17] your friends you can be seated I started
[1:03:41] to go today and and I took a lot of my
[1:03:44] time making my announcement so it's
[1:03:47] already noon so I won't preach a full
[1:03:49] sermon so if you just give me your
[1:03:50] undivided attention I say for about 4045
[1:03:53] minutes we will we will pull the chute
[1:03:57] stand on the brakes and get it stopped
[1:03:59] amen
[1:04:01] I I started to go today into the book of
[1:04:05] Revelation into those first chapters
[1:04:08] describing the church ages and till we
[1:04:11] come along and skipped along till we get
[1:04:14] to the sixth age and you know the the
[1:04:18] sixth age is it was unique because you
[1:04:21] know six is the number of man and we
[1:04:24] find that that seven then is completion
[1:04:27] and so that you know that that brother
[1:04:30] Branham talks about the sixth age and
[1:04:32] then it moves into the seventh age of
[1:04:35] lair Tasya and brother Branham calls it
[1:04:37] the shortest of all the ages and in one
[1:04:40] in one reference he kind of correlates
[1:04:45] it he says you know it could almost be
[1:04:46] thought of as an extension to the sixth
[1:04:50] stage that the seventh layer the CNH
[1:04:52] could almost be thought of as an
[1:04:54] extension of the sixth or the
[1:04:57] Philadelphian age now thank you Tony now
[1:05:00] the reason for that is of course that
[1:05:03] you have to really what I would call
[1:05:10] seminal events
[1:05:11] one in the sixth the end of the sixth
[1:05:14] stage and one in the end of the seventh
[1:05:17] age as it relates to God dealing in the
[1:05:20] church now we can talk about a bride age
[1:05:24] which is just the time within the last
[1:05:27] seventh age that God is dealing strictly
[1:05:30] by the pure word to his bride and if you
[1:05:33] want to come and be redeemed you've got
[1:05:35] to come to that all right and if you and
[1:05:37] if you have a salvation experience in a
[1:05:40] in a in a church system you certainly
[1:05:44] can have that you certainly can have a
[1:05:46] salvation experience there but the Holy
[1:05:48] Ghost will then lead you and guide you
[1:05:51] into all truth to to bring upon you the
[1:05:54] seal of the token and because you it's
[1:05:57] not possible in every case of the Bible
[1:06:00] that somebody was given the token every
[1:06:05] time somebody was given the seal now
[1:06:07] that's not to say the Holy Spirit can
[1:06:10] can work in people's lives that doesn't
[1:06:12] mean there yet sealed all right so the
[1:06:16] justification is a work of the Holy
[1:06:17] Ghost why did you repent see and hear
[1:06:21] you felt sorry for your sin that was the
[1:06:23] Holy Ghost you could have done that Paul
[1:06:24] said your carnal mind is enmity against
[1:06:26] God can never agree with God
[1:06:27] so it took a force greater than you to
[1:06:31] move upon you and you felt sorry for
[1:06:33] your sins and you repented now that
[1:06:35] meant that you are absolved of all the
[1:06:37] guilt of all your sins past it does
[1:06:39] nothing for your future it just simply
[1:06:42] brings you into right standing with God
[1:06:45] that now all of your sins are under the
[1:06:47] blood of Christ but then the Holy Ghost
[1:06:50] will continue or try to to work with you
[1:06:53] to bring you into sanctification and and
[1:06:56] to start sanctifying and cleaning up
[1:06:58] your life and then he will take you on
[1:07:00] into a complete state where all the
[1:07:04] doubt of the world is gone from your
[1:07:06] heart and that boxcar which is your
[1:07:08] heart not your flesh it's not about
[1:07:10] getting your flesh perfect enough to get
[1:07:12] sealed that's never it that's just a
[1:07:14] black that's just a black bird trying to
[1:07:17] put peacock feathers in his tail
[1:07:20] and he's still Raven he never can be a
[1:07:23] peacock disgust he sticks them on his
[1:07:24] tail looks like a peacock that won't
[1:07:26] matter he's got to have a nature change
[1:07:28] he's got a he's got to go from a crow to
[1:07:30] a peacock so so we we find that that
[1:07:34] when brother Branham gives the analogy
[1:07:36] of the boxcar that's your heart and
[1:07:38] what's inside that box car is only one
[1:07:40] of two things faith or doubt and so if
[1:07:44] there's any any at all any doubt still
[1:07:47] in there you might have joined a church
[1:07:48] and repented and even stopped your lion
[1:07:50] and it started singing in the choir and
[1:07:53] maybe started getting sanctified but if
[1:07:55] there's still elements down inside your
[1:07:57] heart that you kind of still like the
[1:07:59] world you kind of you know yours there's
[1:08:01] still that thirst there there's still
[1:08:03] that hunger you're just you know you
[1:08:04] wanna go to hell and you're trying to be
[1:08:06] a good boy or trying to be a good girl
[1:08:07] that's a miserable place to live anyways
[1:08:10] but the devil will keep you there and
[1:08:13] tell you you've got the seal you don't
[1:08:15] have the seal because he won't seal that
[1:08:18] boxcar until every bit of doubt is gone
[1:08:21] out of your heart and the inspector
[1:08:23] looks in there and sees tight faith it's
[1:08:26] not rattling it's not shaky faith it's
[1:08:30] solid it's tight and he says this guy's
[1:08:34] a believer seal the door and you're
[1:08:36] sealed to the day when that when you
[1:08:39] roll into the final station hallelujah
[1:08:43] now the sad part of that is people go
[1:08:47] years getting through those processes
[1:08:48] and that is so ridiculous because you
[1:08:51] don't have to wait five seconds to get
[1:08:55] all three of those in your life all it
[1:08:58] takes is a moment where you are
[1:09:00] completely done with the world and you
[1:09:04] and you want him and you own only him
[1:09:08] and you don't want any more of the world
[1:09:10] and you fall on your face and say dear
[1:09:12] God I want you I want your life in my
[1:09:16] life I'm done with the world I'm done
[1:09:18] with being me I don't I'm tired of being
[1:09:21] Jacob I want to be have a name change
[1:09:23] and when God can see
[1:09:25] that that is real and it's sincere and
[1:09:29] you really mean it and he looks in the
[1:09:31] Box card sees Wow that's for real i'ma
[1:09:34] tell you in five seconds you can go from
[1:09:37] the rank Center to a saint of Almighty
[1:09:40] God sealed into the kingdom of God you
[1:09:43] need not wait 10 days in an upper room
[1:09:46] anymore
[1:09:48] that was only until the Holy Ghost came
[1:09:50] now you don't have to do that you don't
[1:09:53] have to fast you don't have to you don't
[1:09:55] have to pray you have to believe you
[1:09:57] have to accept it you have to have a
[1:09:59] complete dying out in your heart and
[1:10:01] from that and then from that moment
[1:10:03] you're only beginning
[1:10:04] now you're gonna begin to add and add
[1:10:07] and add and add you're gaining in virtue
[1:10:12] and knowledge and temperance and
[1:10:13] meekness and your your your you're
[1:10:15] growing you're strong you're fully
[1:10:17] empowered as a son of God the moment
[1:10:19] you're a son of God you're not lacking
[1:10:21] in any authority of heaven but you know
[1:10:24] God's not gonna bring a man out of the
[1:10:25] barroom and stick him in a pulpit the
[1:10:27] next day you know so so there is a
[1:10:30] growth there is a maturing that takes
[1:10:33] place and so so we find in that that
[1:10:38] that that two things the seminal moments
[1:10:42] that would happen at the end of the
[1:10:45] sixth age and at the end of the seventh
[1:10:48] age is where at the end of the sixth age
[1:10:50] after the messengers actually gone off
[1:10:52] the scene God is going to set an open
[1:10:54] door which is a revelation of Jesus
[1:10:56] Christ and there's going to be people
[1:10:59] rise up contrary to John Wesley and
[1:11:01] catch a revelation of of Jesus name
[1:11:05] baptism and one God faith that he's not
[1:11:08] three like John taught them and they're
[1:11:11] not rejecting John Wesley's teaching to
[1:11:14] not be turnit Ariens that's not a
[1:11:17] rejection of the sixth church age
[1:11:19] messenger because his message is
[1:11:20] sanctification he didn't have all the
[1:11:23] understanding so if he had have been
[1:11:25] alive and God would have sent that open
[1:11:27] door in front of him Wesley would have
[1:11:28] walked in it immediately so it's very
[1:11:32] obvious it's it's evidently apparent
[1:11:35] that it was sent there after his
[1:11:37] departure he
[1:11:39] cuz now the church was going to begin in
[1:11:42] the six states to understand Jesus name
[1:11:45] baptism and and and and it kind of it
[1:11:48] still wasn't the full picture kind of
[1:11:50] was a Jesus only oneness thing which is
[1:11:52] not exactly the the whole package either
[1:11:55] one is their Trinitarian oneness we've
[1:11:58] explained that before they they don't
[1:12:00] have in either one of their formulas the
[1:12:02] exact formula it took the opening of
[1:12:04] seals to do that and so so we find that
[1:12:08] that quite naturally then that
[1:12:11] revelation that began in the sixth would
[1:12:14] continue carrying on into the seventh oh
[1:12:16] that's my brother Brandon would say the
[1:12:18] seventh is almost like an extension of
[1:12:20] the sixth almost like a continuation
[1:12:22] because the opening revelation of the
[1:12:24] seventh starts at the end of the six
[1:12:26] before the seventh arrives and that's
[1:12:28] why you have men like like lake in
[1:12:32] different ones who were ahead of this as
[1:12:34] a revival in the late 1800s starting to
[1:12:37] preach an experience and the Holy Ghost
[1:12:39] already starting to understand Jesus
[1:12:42] name baptism and then it's it's it's a
[1:12:45] half a decade into the 20th century
[1:12:47] before the Azusa revival hits and when
[1:12:51] it hits one of its founders daddy
[1:12:52] Seymour didn't even William Seymour
[1:12:55] didn't even get it himself his wife got
[1:12:57] it three years at him people mocked him
[1:13:00] said you're a prayer preaching about
[1:13:01] something you didn't got it yourself he
[1:13:03] was honest enough to admit it but he got
[1:13:05] it oh he had that experience let me tell
[1:13:09] you something and that was God bringing
[1:13:11] forth another not they called it the
[1:13:14] Pentecostal revival and brother branham
[1:13:18] fine brother Brandon went along calling
[1:13:20] it that as well that was the the
[1:13:22] language they understood it to be but
[1:13:24] brother Branham after the seals corrects
[1:13:26] that understanding even though he kept
[1:13:28] using that phrase because that was the
[1:13:30] accepted phrase Pentecost
[1:13:32] but brother Branham said it wasn't
[1:13:34] actually the long-awaited restoration
[1:13:38] that was promised we were promised a
[1:13:42] restoration a full complete restoration
[1:13:44] he said they thought they had it he said
[1:13:46] when they denominated it proved that
[1:13:48] have it because they denominated and you
[1:13:51] can't denominator for restoration you
[1:13:53] follow me cuz it's Christ you can't
[1:13:56] denominating a man and so so we find
[1:13:59] then that brother Brandon would say you
[1:14:02] can't mix Pentecost with this message
[1:14:05] and to my astonishment has left me at
[1:14:10] times almost stupefied to hear people
[1:14:13] imagining that when he says you can't
[1:14:15] mix Pentecost with this that he's
[1:14:18] somehow talking about the original faith
[1:14:20] of the father's that hid in the upper
[1:14:22] room you can't mix that with this wait
[1:14:24] what
[1:14:24] this is that restored
[1:14:28] this is picks up where that declined in
[1:14:31] his end and moves on to a body change
[1:14:34] they had the token you think Paul didn't
[1:14:37] have the token you think they didn't
[1:14:40] have the Jubilee you think they didn't
[1:14:41] have the abstract title that was what
[1:14:45] the whole Old Testament promise was
[1:14:47] promising them and Peter said this is
[1:14:50] that that we were promised what they go
[1:14:53] back and look what they were promised it
[1:14:55] was the full Jubilee the full abstract
[1:14:58] God and man coming back being United in
[1:15:01] one now they were going to move on to a
[1:15:03] body change only they didn't the
[1:15:06] disciples went off the scene and the
[1:15:07] Church fell away just like the Bible
[1:15:09] said it would and when it comes back it
[1:15:12] comes back in a three justification
[1:15:15] sanctification Pentecostal Azusa revival
[1:15:19] you understand but then the seals had to
[1:15:22] be open and when the seals are open now
[1:15:24] we've got the fullness of everything
[1:15:28] that Luther had and the parts Luther
[1:15:30] didn't understand everything Wesley had
[1:15:32] plus the parts he didn't understand
[1:15:34] everything the Azusa revivalist had plus
[1:15:36] the parts they didn't understand and now
[1:15:38] we've got the mighty angel descended
[1:15:40] among us the pillar of fire living in us
[1:15:43] and once again the Jubilee the abstract
[1:15:45] the token is in the bride she's the
[1:15:47] final voice to the final age
[1:15:49] when brother Branham says you can't mix
[1:15:51] Pentecost with this he's talking about
[1:15:53] what the Azusa revival turned into it
[1:15:58] became a denominational mess and brother
[1:16:02] Branham said you can't mix this seven
[1:16:05] sealed message with that mess wasn't
[1:16:07] talking about the Bible Pentecost that
[1:16:10] was the full Jubilee and I get
[1:16:15] astonished that somebody could think
[1:16:16] that I said my goodness what are we even
[1:16:19] God I mean if this message isn't the
[1:16:22] restoration of that then you've got
[1:16:23] another Jesus you've got something the
[1:16:26] Bible never prophesied was coming
[1:16:29] whatever every scripture that prophesies
[1:16:32] about this message is that it's a
[1:16:34] restoration of the original of course
[1:16:36] they didn't fully fulfill everything
[1:16:39] they all died the church fell I get that
[1:16:42] that's what the that's if you want to
[1:16:45] say where this is a bride age wonderful
[1:16:48] just don't make it an anything you know
[1:16:51] I don't like them making an eighth age
[1:16:52] because then they got to have an eighth
[1:16:53] messenger boy if we had a ton of them
[1:16:57] ding-dongs pause more trouble let me
[1:17:03] taste some friends you're looking at it
[1:17:05] I can say that authoritative Lee I was
[1:17:07] born in this thing I was raised up in
[1:17:09] this I've watched it my whole life
[1:17:10] I'm not a johnny-come-lately ding-dongs
[1:17:14] man who promoted their own self and
[1:17:18] ruined families and ruined churches and
[1:17:20] gave false expectations and blew up
[1:17:23] young people before they could even get
[1:17:26] out of the blocks destroyed marriages
[1:17:29] and destroyed homes enough of it away
[1:17:31] with it it's the word of the word only
[1:17:33] hallelujah we're not here to lift up a
[1:17:35] man or another super ministry I made it
[1:17:38] a something we're all the family of God
[1:17:40] we're all in this thing together friends
[1:17:44] Wow I'll never stop crying out against
[1:17:47] that nonsense
[1:17:49] [Applause]
[1:17:50] too many times we've saw it wreck homes
[1:17:53] and churches and people come to nothing
[1:17:57] then better to have never started and so
[1:18:02] so we find that the harmony of the word
[1:18:06] is flawless if you'll just let it speak
[1:18:08] for itself and stop trying to bend it to
[1:18:12] your own agenda it's when I say to him
[1:18:14] stop trying to bend it to your own
[1:18:15] agenda just let it speak for itself it
[1:18:17] flows it's perfect it's it's harmonious
[1:18:22] it's one will make the symphony play in
[1:18:26] sympathy yeah that's what I want to be I
[1:18:31] want to be in sympathy with the composer
[1:18:34] hallelujah and so the jet the seventh
[1:18:42] age then what's their epic moment if in
[1:18:45] the six age it was the open door
[1:18:47] starting at all what's the epic moment
[1:18:50] in the seventh age and I covered this a
[1:18:52] couple of weeks ago they the last age is
[1:18:56] unique in many respects first of all
[1:18:59] we're the only age that takes a global
[1:19:00] body change man
[1:19:03] now the first age had the word to do
[1:19:06] that and they got to the point they
[1:19:08] could have done that but they couldn't
[1:19:09] do that they could but they couldn't
[1:19:11] they could because they were they
[1:19:13] elected they could because they had the
[1:19:14] Jubilee they could because they had the
[1:19:16] token they could because they had the
[1:19:17] perfect word from Paul they couldn't
[1:19:21] because the seed had to go into the
[1:19:23] ground the seed had to go into the
[1:19:26] ground Jesus could have chose to live
[1:19:29] forever but he couldn't he could have
[1:19:31] but he couldn't he get me he could have
[1:19:34] decided no that's not gonna die forget
[1:19:36] it
[1:19:37] no I'm not gonna do it but he couldn't
[1:19:41] so so the age could have went but they
[1:19:44] couldn't go because the seed had to go
[1:19:46] to the ground we had to be here this is
[1:19:49] God's masterpiece plan don't fight
[1:19:52] against it
[1:19:53] just be glad you're in be glad you see
[1:19:55] it hallelujah I'm glad it makes sense to
[1:19:58] me it feel
[1:20:00] said it it puts my puts wind under mine
[1:20:03] under my wings the unique thing that
[1:20:08] happened in the latest Sein age as a
[1:20:10] church dealing God dealing with the
[1:20:13] nominal church systems remember brides
[1:20:16] called out of that right the the the
[1:20:20] seminal moment of the church ages of of
[1:20:23] man-made systems was that they got into
[1:20:28] a very bad situation and the only one
[1:20:31] that could help them they kicked him out
[1:20:35] read revelation three he's on the
[1:20:38] outside knocking and now when he's
[1:20:41] knocking he doesn't even he's not even
[1:20:43] now he once he's put out he's not
[1:20:45] dealing with that with those systems or
[1:20:47] groups notice what he's saying if any
[1:20:49] man not if any group I'm done with
[1:20:53] groups they threw me out fine if any man
[1:20:56] hear my voice and open I'll come in to
[1:20:58] him and I'll sup with him and he with me
[1:21:01] come out of her my people whole you
[1:21:04] can't make this stuff up this took God
[1:21:06] to put all this together and so the
[1:21:11] earth you know had had reached an
[1:21:15] amazing time and prophecy when the as
[1:21:18] the sixth Gentile age was drawing to a
[1:21:24] close
[1:21:24] God still had a seventh star in his
[1:21:28] right hand and it's interesting because
[1:21:32] God was not thrown off and never is
[1:21:38] thrown off by the contrivances of man
[1:21:41] man thinks he can the devil thinks he's
[1:21:43] been trying to throw God off his plan
[1:21:44] and the devil does a certain move and
[1:21:47] God lets it happen and the devil goes
[1:21:49] gotcha and God goes no got you again and
[1:21:54] then God rearranged at it in and God two
[1:21:56] steps back the devil runs him haha
[1:21:59] gotcha got you again and so you know God
[1:22:07] knew what he was doing we we've been
[1:22:09] talking about the very characteristics
[1:22:11] of even the native
[1:22:12] Americans and their their
[1:22:15] characteristics that had to be designed
[1:22:17] by God because the Prophet was even
[1:22:19] going to come out of that culture and
[1:22:21] beat because he remember I taught you
[1:22:23] how he had to be a wilderness man but he
[1:22:26] wasn't gonna be in Palestine he's gonna
[1:22:27] be North America so how does God get a
[1:22:30] prophet let me see what's the best way
[1:22:32] to get a prophet a Gentile prophet in
[1:22:35] North America and I need him to be a
[1:22:37] wilderness man like a for-real one okay
[1:22:40] great I'll make his grandmother a
[1:22:42] full-blooded Native American and his mom
[1:22:44] will be a half-breed and that'll be just
[1:22:46] enough wildness in him to make him a man
[1:22:48] of the wilderness
[1:22:51] perfect so as the age was winding down
[1:22:56] and I'm going over all this because and
[1:23:00] I went over it very slow last time I'm
[1:23:02] doing the same thing again today because
[1:23:04] I'm taking on a journey I want you to
[1:23:06] follow me and watch all this unfold
[1:23:08] because you're in it you're in this
[1:23:10] story I'm telling and so we see that the
[1:23:14] earth had reached a time and prophecy
[1:23:16] when the six Gentile age would start
[1:23:19] winding down and would start drawing to
[1:23:21] a close
[1:23:22] history shows us that all of Europe and
[1:23:25] Asia the African nations the Middle East
[1:23:29] they were all feeling the grips of a
[1:23:33] almost an unappeasable stagnation you
[1:23:38] all through year the European
[1:23:40] battlegrounds had been bathed in blood
[1:23:43] for for hundreds of years centuries of
[1:23:48] fighting since the time of our Lord's
[1:23:51] departure and they start keeping the
[1:23:55] time with the calendar that we have
[1:23:57] today and it's been adjusted various
[1:23:59] times but more or less tracking along
[1:24:01] the first century the second century the
[1:24:03] third century you know and and you get
[1:24:06] to 11
[1:24:07] you know 92 and then you get into 1450
[1:24:10] and and so on and so on and at all this
[1:24:12] time all of Europe and Asia especially
[1:24:15] Asia one of those ancient civilisations
[1:24:18] known to man all through the
[1:24:20] scandinavian countries and the celtic
[1:24:22] lands and the and we're not
[1:24:25] here to give you a history lesson I'm
[1:24:26] sure you're familiar with the history of
[1:24:29] the what they called the old world and
[1:24:33] it had reached a point by the time you
[1:24:35] came down to the end of the of the sixth
[1:24:38] age with this with the stagnation and
[1:24:41] centuries of war and upheaval had so
[1:24:44] thoroughly and so it had so thoroughly
[1:24:47] wearied the advanced civilized parts of
[1:24:51] the world we find that that that that
[1:24:55] the last that the last phase of God's
[1:24:58] seven part plan for church ages seven
[1:25:03] church ages it would require fresh
[1:25:07] ground non destroyed in history it would
[1:25:12] require fresh ground it would require a
[1:25:16] vast clean swath of land and at that
[1:25:21] time America was largely unexplored
[1:25:25] undiscovered it was really almost like
[1:25:28] an not completely undiscovered but
[1:25:31] almost undiscovered and largely
[1:25:33] unexplored part of the earth they even
[1:25:37] referred to it all over Central Europe
[1:25:39] as the new world they called it that
[1:25:43] it's the new world that's hard for your
[1:25:46] mind to get around that because there's
[1:25:48] nowhere in the world people haven't been
[1:25:49] but at this time this was an unexplored
[1:25:53] continent
[1:25:54] it wasn't uninhabited but it was
[1:25:57] uncivilized and unexplored and largely
[1:26:00] undiscovered they had no it they had
[1:26:04] they had they didn't even understand you
[1:26:07] know it took Lewis and Clark Tut to go
[1:26:10] out from from from Old Hickory from from
[1:26:13] Jackson had to hire them
[1:26:15] I think of Jackson or Jefferson I think
[1:26:17] with Jackson hired them to go and find a
[1:26:21] Western route to the ocean see if you
[1:26:24] can differ if there's a navigable course
[1:26:27] that we could sail there and of course
[1:26:29] there's not because you run into the
[1:26:30] Rocky Mountains and so so we find then
[1:26:34] that that revelation now here's another
[1:26:36] unique characteristic
[1:26:39] so revelation and brother branham picks
[1:26:41] this up I'm reading here in a second
[1:26:43] look away to Jesus
[1:26:44] so revelations showing how that in this
[1:26:49] land when revelation spoke of this land
[1:26:52] brother Branham says revelation 13
[1:26:54] plainly explains it this look awaited
[1:26:56] Jesus December 63 the Lamb you read it
[1:27:00] revelation come up out of the earth
[1:27:04] now the other beast which is in the book
[1:27:07] of Revelation it come up out of water
[1:27:10] because in the book of Revelation water
[1:27:13] mint thickness and multitudes and
[1:27:14] peoples and nations see it come up out
[1:27:18] of water thickness and multitudes of
[1:27:19] people this lamb here come up where
[1:27:24] there were no people just scattered
[1:27:27] natives there was no civilized culture
[1:27:30] it was just scattered natives right and
[1:27:33] and he's and and it shows he come up in
[1:27:36] land where there were no people a lamb
[1:27:38] represents a religion the Lamb of God
[1:27:40] remember remember it spoke like a lamb
[1:27:43] it was a lamb then after a while it
[1:27:48] received power and spoke like a dragon
[1:27:52] now from the days of our founding
[1:27:55] fathers and we've been examining the
[1:27:57] lives of them from the days of our
[1:28:00] founding father to the hour that we're
[1:28:02] living in it's been changing from a lamb
[1:28:05] to a dragon see watch and we find that
[1:28:10] that and the dragon alright and it spoke
[1:28:14] like a dragon and exercised all the
[1:28:17] power the dragon had before him and a
[1:28:21] dragon is Rome always so don't you see
[1:28:25] Roman denomination a mark Protestant
[1:28:30] denomination an image to the Beast
[1:28:34] get it again a Roman denomination mark
[1:28:39] of the beast Protestant denomination an
[1:28:43] image unto the Beast those were the
[1:28:46] beast in the image were two different
[1:28:48] things in the book of Revelation
[1:28:50] making here's what it'll make it'll make
[1:28:53] a power that'll force all Protestants
[1:28:56] like a union you'll have to be in this
[1:28:59] Council of Churches or you won't be able
[1:29:01] to have fellowship and you say man
[1:29:05] that's gonna be a long time coming it's
[1:29:06] already in effect has been for a while
[1:29:09] there's there are things that just like
[1:29:12] for instance I'm a Christian Church
[1:29:14] there's other Christian churches but I
[1:29:16] can't go into them and preach they won't
[1:29:18] have me you know why I don't have one of
[1:29:19] their letters I don't have a letter of
[1:29:23] reference from the headquarters so now
[1:29:25] we both carry a Bible I can't preach
[1:29:28] there see it's forcing me oh you want to
[1:29:32] preach in our church you got to go join
[1:29:34] our headquarters and take some classes
[1:29:36] and get a certification and then you can
[1:29:38] come here and preach see wow that still
[1:29:42] I say well that's kind of small remember
[1:29:44] it's going from a lamb to a lion I mean
[1:29:47] from a lamb to a dragon you haven't seen
[1:29:49] the dragon full on yet you're starting
[1:29:51] to see it now
[1:29:52] you're starting to see it now we found
[1:29:56] that as I've been showing you that the
[1:29:58] very molding and I'm trying to get you
[1:30:03] to here's what I'm trying to do in case
[1:30:04] you're wanting where is this going
[1:30:06] I'm trying to get you to show I'm trying
[1:30:09] to get you to understand that your being
[1:30:11] here here in America in Revelation 13 at
[1:30:16] this time under a message is a very
[1:30:20] amazing thing and it is something that
[1:30:23] God has been controlling and controlling
[1:30:26] and controlling you are at the end of a
[1:30:28] long daisy chain of controls that God
[1:30:31] has been implementing globally he kept
[1:30:35] this world unexplored and and
[1:30:38] undiscovered why because the last age
[1:30:41] would need a vast clean undisturbed land
[1:30:45] for this message and he put you here he
[1:30:51] didn't put you you weren't born in
[1:30:54] Europe you're born here you're an
[1:30:57] American you're you're in the North
[1:30:59] American continent in the United States
[1:31:02] of America you're in the land of rebel
[1:31:04] 13 you're in the land that a prophet was
[1:31:06] sent to you are the people that God
[1:31:10] foresaw 2,000 years before this nation
[1:31:12] even died here now if that's true and
[1:31:16] I'm showing it to you in the Bible and
[1:31:18] by prophecy in my history
[1:31:19] then what doesn't that inform your
[1:31:22] thinking it informs my thinking it
[1:31:24] starts telling me my goodness none of
[1:31:27] this was an accident I'm here as a
[1:31:29] purpose of God because remember my whole
[1:31:33] sermon is there's got to be a voice at
[1:31:35] the end time and I showed you couple
[1:31:37] weeks ago it's not just a voice of your
[1:31:38] lips it's a voice of your life that the
[1:31:42] world in its madness can't find right
[1:31:44] from wrong can't discern it can't
[1:31:45] discovered they've already lost the
[1:31:48] ability there's a plague say Oh Corona
[1:31:54] Corona is a toothache compared to this
[1:31:57] plague there's a plague infecting men's
[1:32:00] mind that he can't comprehend the the
[1:32:05] condition he's in the proof of that you
[1:32:08] want proof you only need to read the
[1:32:11] prophecy concerning lair to see that
[1:32:13] that when they're actually poor and
[1:32:15] miserable and naked they say I'm rich
[1:32:19] and increased with Goods and have need
[1:32:20] of nothing because there's a there's a
[1:32:24] global humanity wide blindness that has
[1:32:29] set down upon them and largely because
[1:32:33] that God says in the last days that
[1:32:36] people who resist the word and they did
[1:32:38] they resisted Wesley
[1:32:41] they re in there in his age they
[1:32:43] resisted Azusa Street revival in their
[1:32:45] age they resisted in lights of the
[1:32:47] Prophet and God says every time you
[1:32:49] resist my messenger I'm going to send a
[1:32:51] strong delusion upon you and it will
[1:32:55] blind you and you'll believe a lie and
[1:32:58] be damned by it and it won't be God
[1:33:02] doing it to be doing it to yourself yeah
[1:33:04] and so God then if you can see that
[1:33:10] you're here it's almost poetic it's it's
[1:33:14] so choreographed it's like a ballet it's
[1:33:16] it
[1:33:17] something of beauty that this thing has
[1:33:19] been with such timing and perfect
[1:33:22] synchronous harmony with history and
[1:33:25] politics and God raised up dictators to
[1:33:29] perform his will and you can even he was
[1:33:32] describing what they would do before
[1:33:34] they were born and they were born and
[1:33:36] rose up and did just what he said come
[1:33:39] on friends this isn't an accidental
[1:33:41] you're not an accidental believer you're
[1:33:43] not just here persuaded by we got good
[1:33:45] preaching or better doctrine it's
[1:33:46] nothing to do with that there's a person
[1:33:48] among us and it's Christ the word and I
[1:33:52] am infected with Jesus Christ and what
[1:33:55] is it done it is open my eyes and remove
[1:33:57] the blindness from me so I see clearly
[1:34:01] what is around me I'm not wondering Oh
[1:34:04] God thank God I'm not groping in
[1:34:08] darkness Satan always pushing at our
[1:34:14] minds oh I I always never never fails
[1:34:19] every generation of young people that
[1:34:20] raised up what we've had think we're
[1:34:22] working on our sixth or seventh
[1:34:23] generation by this point every
[1:34:26] generation of young people that raises
[1:34:27] up I see some come in and believe and be
[1:34:29] strong and some drift away and go into
[1:34:32] chaos breaks my heart every time I woke
[1:34:34] up at 3:00 in the morning praying for
[1:34:36] some of our teenagers let me tell you
[1:34:37] something teenagers this is the hour
[1:34:39] Satan is so determined you just don't
[1:34:42] know how determined he is to wreck your
[1:34:44] testimony because there's a voice in the
[1:34:46] last day once again the earth will hear
[1:34:49] from direct from God through you and
[1:34:50] Satan is trying to stop that don't let
[1:34:54] him don't let him stand and be a voice
[1:34:58] for Almighty God we're going home soon
[1:35:05] from the molding of its native carrot
[1:35:08] carrot culture shaping their very
[1:35:12] characteristics down through millennia
[1:35:14] adding just enough of it and a prophet
[1:35:18] to the final age who would come to the
[1:35:20] final land it be a nation what would it
[1:35:24] be it would be a nation that would be
[1:35:29] privileged
[1:35:30] to hear the final revelation of Jesus
[1:35:33] Christ to the world first be the first
[1:35:36] ones to hear it in your native tongue
[1:35:39] people disregard it and trivialize it
[1:35:42] saying in the Senate school class today
[1:35:44] hardly ever listen to a tape ever and
[1:35:46] yet you were granted the privilege to
[1:35:49] hear it first in your native tongue and
[1:35:52] even and and and then the only country
[1:35:56] in the world that can definitively
[1:35:57] understand Kentucky English the rest of
[1:36:01] the world depends on you for that even
[1:36:04] when they go and learn English they
[1:36:05] still have to ask us about some Kentucky
[1:36:07] words brother Bonnie don't worry brother
[1:36:08] I mean by that okay sit down it's gonna
[1:36:10] take a little bit I got to explain why
[1:36:13] you need to know the history the only
[1:36:18] nation with enough financial resources
[1:36:19] and global influence to propagate it
[1:36:22] around the world this world jumps up and
[1:36:26] down because they think they're so smart
[1:36:29] we've accomplished so much we got the
[1:36:31] greatest military we got the greatest
[1:36:32] economy I got the greatest government
[1:36:33] got the greatest
[1:36:35] you got nothing but what God gave you
[1:36:37] for this message and and and when this
[1:36:40] message and its believers are gone
[1:36:41] you're gonna see that you really ain't
[1:36:42] got much you're gonna find out when
[1:36:46] you're laying under atomic destruction
[1:36:48] you think that's easy for me to say I
[1:36:51] love this country I love this nation I
[1:36:54] talk about not being an American that's
[1:36:56] I'm only talking about I'm not
[1:36:57] identified with the culture I love my
[1:37:01] country very patriotic breaks my heart
[1:37:04] to see the calamities that are going on
[1:37:06] I I know I know
[1:37:10] I realized that of George Washington and
[1:37:12] an Abraham Lincoln in every county
[1:37:13] wouldn't turn it around that boy I'd
[1:37:14] sure love to see that I'd love to live
[1:37:17] in a land where I could just go see
[1:37:19] George and Abraham and sit down and talk
[1:37:21] to him you know what they would you know
[1:37:22] what they would tell you if you did they
[1:37:24] tell you what I'm preaching to you and
[1:37:27] say listen man we got a message you
[1:37:28] don't have to worry we got a way out of
[1:37:30] this we got a way through it and out of
[1:37:33] it this is the nation that would produce
[1:37:40] the shock to carry the word long safely
[1:37:42] while it was developing that
[1:37:44] the Pentecostal revival that didn't fall
[1:37:46] in England or Europe or Asia or the
[1:37:49] islands it fell here and it didn't even
[1:37:53] fall on the East Coast it fell as far
[1:37:55] west and you can go before you go back
[1:37:57] east
[1:38:01] it became the cradle this nation became
[1:38:05] the cradle of the restored mystery that
[1:38:08] Paul's age fell back from failing to see
[1:38:10] it fully manifested the third pole
[1:38:13] landed here one of the most epic
[1:38:20] consequential something God waited 2,000
[1:38:25] years to bring back to the earth the
[1:38:28] third pole operated in Jesus ministry it
[1:38:31] operated in the early church you know
[1:38:34] why you know the son of man minister say
[1:38:36] well we got a prophet son Aaron ministry
[1:38:37] they had a son of man ministry because
[1:38:39] the son of man ministry means the Word
[1:38:41] made flesh the office of son of man is a
[1:38:45] prophet the ministry of son of man is a
[1:38:48] broader term that's all of us I'm not
[1:38:51] the office of son of man I'm not a
[1:38:53] prophet but I have the Ministry of the
[1:38:55] son of man you understand at 4:18 p.m.
[1:39:01] on July the 20th 1969 you remember that
[1:39:08] date with Charles I hear brother Charles
[1:39:11] in here
[1:39:11] yeah I hear I hear somebody 4:18 p.m.
[1:39:16] July 20 1969 Neil Armstrong's voice
[1:39:22] cracked from the speakers at NASA's
[1:39:24] Mission Control and he said simply the
[1:39:27] eagle has landed
[1:39:30] it's a great monumental moment for us
[1:39:35] great swelling national pride it was a
[1:39:38] fine announcement but it was more than
[1:39:41] half a decade late the eagle had already
[1:39:44] landed and he didn't land on the moon he
[1:39:49] landed on the earth
[1:39:51] Jehovah Eagle a half a decade prior to
[1:39:56] brother Neil
[1:39:57] jehovah eagle had already entered
[1:40:01] dropped into Earth's atmosphere over
[1:40:03] arizona and lifts a prophet up off the
[1:40:06] ground into that and says now go back
[1:40:09] east for the opening of the seven seals
[1:40:11] people can believe what they want about
[1:40:14] that it happened it didn't happen
[1:40:16] whatever I don't care I I could not
[1:40:19] possibly care less than I already don't
[1:40:23] that makes any sense I believe it
[1:40:27] happened it's changed my life it's
[1:40:32] changed people I preached to so you've
[1:40:35] come too late to tell me that was this
[1:40:37] it was that it was a rocket rocket
[1:40:40] formed a really a rocket over the
[1:40:44] Arizona desert form the cloud that when
[1:40:46] you turn it it looks like the perfect
[1:40:48] profile image of Jesus Christ really I'm
[1:40:54] sorry you got more faith than I got I
[1:40:56] don't believe a rocket can do that let
[1:41:00] me take some friends there is nothing
[1:41:02] about this message accidental or
[1:41:03] incidental it is all Purpose Driven and
[1:41:06] it is all vitally important this is what
[1:41:10] God has done in this age to Ireland to
[1:41:13] us as a people what are we doing with it
[1:41:16] what does it mean to you to see you know
[1:41:24] a javo eagle arriving with a sonic a
[1:41:28] literal physical sonic shockwave that
[1:41:33] shook the whole countryside so powerful
[1:41:36] a prophet thought he would would be the
[1:41:38] end of his life jump 10 feet off the
[1:41:41] ground people heard it for miles
[1:41:44] Jehovah Eagle today truly the Eagle
[1:41:48] didn't land on the moon brother branham
[1:41:50] said what are they gonna find on the
[1:41:51] moon nothing said that years for they
[1:41:54] went and found nothing bunch of rocks
[1:41:57] and he told him he said I don't care
[1:42:00] about the moon he said I want to pass
[1:42:02] the Moose fast
[1:42:04] the Milky Way oh my friends Jehovah
[1:42:08] eagle has landed and a bride for the
[1:42:11] final sweep to the potty change that's
[1:42:13] what you're a part of that's what are
[1:42:15] part of that's what we're preaching
[1:42:17] that's what we believe to see how this
[1:42:22] nation
[1:42:23] I got a hurry at six minutes was blessed
[1:42:27] with every virtue and resource that the
[1:42:30] nations of the earth were lacking
[1:42:31] desperately needing the door then is
[1:42:36] open under the sixth age but there there
[1:42:39] had to be a continuation it couldn't
[1:42:41] just be as I said in the beginning it
[1:42:43] couldn't just be a door that opened and
[1:42:45] that was going to be it it was going to
[1:42:47] continue to the full power then the full
[1:42:50] revelation had to be realized the door
[1:42:53] now watch this now
[1:42:55] there had to be a prophet to bring this
[1:43:00] message amen but there had to be a
[1:43:06] people to express it because it came I
[1:43:13] think I could end right here today
[1:43:15] send you home with this it came to be
[1:43:19] expressed it didn't come to fill us with
[1:43:24] knowledge it came to get behind skin it
[1:43:28] didn't come to just stay on a tape it
[1:43:30] came to come off a tape in the ears down
[1:43:33] in a soul out through flesh out through
[1:43:35] testimony
[1:43:36] hallelujah it came to be expressed in
[1:43:39] people it came to live behind flesh some
[1:43:42] day this book will be closed for the
[1:43:44] last time and when that happens the word
[1:43:47] will be flesh again and that's why it
[1:43:51] came in that's why we had a nation and
[1:43:53] that's why we had a culture that's why
[1:43:55] we had a prophet that's why you're here
[1:43:57] you're a believer you're the one who God
[1:43:59] said propagate this around the world
[1:44:00] live this here and understand the
[1:44:03] Kentucky whose rise up tell the whole
[1:44:05] world about it
[1:44:06] and we do and we are hallelujah we're
[1:44:10] trying to tell them on every platform we
[1:44:12] can I can't worry about coronavirus I
[1:44:15] can't worry about governments I can't
[1:44:17] worry about lockdowns I can't worry
[1:44:18] about doubters and unbelievers and
[1:44:20] rejecters and defectors and people who
[1:44:22] want to do whatever they want to do I
[1:44:23] don't care I don't have time time is too
[1:44:25] short it's a precious commodity we gotta
[1:44:29] we gotta we gotta take the last bit of
[1:44:31] time we got and be an expression of this
[1:44:35] word stand to be an expression of this
[1:44:44] word is not only I want to say this now
[1:44:50] real listen close to be an expression of
[1:44:53] this endtime word it's not only vital
[1:44:58] but by comparison it's all that matters
[1:45:02] now I say I qualify it by saying by
[1:45:06] comparison because hey we got to live we
[1:45:08] got to work jobs pay bills buy food
[1:45:10] raise families we take vacations we live
[1:45:13] a life we do live here you understand
[1:45:15] I've not got out yet not trying to get
[1:45:17] out I'm trying to finish my job so I get
[1:45:20] that we have life life's happening but
[1:45:23] while I'm here I need to understand that
[1:45:27] the first and foremost thing of
[1:45:30] importance in our lives is to express it
[1:45:36] to make everything God has done up to
[1:45:41] now should I say worth it no it's
[1:45:45] already worth it but to to make it
[1:45:50] complete the whole thing all along
[1:45:55] listen listen all along God has had it
[1:45:58] in mind that this would be a family
[1:46:01] affair Jesus came and did what only he
[1:46:07] could do that's why he doesn't need you
[1:46:09] to do it the disciples Peter said you
[1:46:13] know we'll do this in you know no man
[1:46:17] takes my life I lay it down I pick it
[1:46:19] back up
[1:46:20] Jesus came and did the only thing he
[1:46:23] would ever need to do alone
[1:46:26] he died alone
[1:46:30] he raised alone he ascended alone but
[1:46:36] when he came back to the church into the
[1:46:39] Upper Room he would never be alone again
[1:46:43] and he would never make a move alone
[1:46:47] again he would need you just like he
[1:46:52] needed pull just like he needed James
[1:46:55] just like he needed Peter just like he
[1:46:58] needed John Bartholomew Thomas il-10 the
[1:47:03] cave
[1:47:04] Thomas was martyred in in india's in
[1:47:07] india they were hunting and they
[1:47:09] couldn't catch him he the reason they
[1:47:12] were trying to kill him is because he
[1:47:13] wouldn't stop doing miracles and he was
[1:47:17] converting them by the thousands because
[1:47:19] he was doing impossible miracles
[1:47:21] breaking all laws of science and physics
[1:47:23] right in front of their eyes they
[1:47:26] couldn't deny his message and so they
[1:47:28] decided to send assassins and I I stood
[1:47:32] by the cliff and put my hand in the
[1:47:35] places where assassins scaled because
[1:47:40] they couldn't get to him any other way
[1:47:41] they had to scale up a mountain and come
[1:47:44] in and sneak in behind him and he was
[1:47:46] down praying when they ran him through
[1:47:47] with the Lance from behind and he died
[1:47:51] on his knees Jesus told him that would
[1:47:54] happen men will hate you and kill you
[1:47:57] thinking they're doing me a favor
[1:48:01] God used those men and when they were
[1:48:06] gone he used the church and when that
[1:48:08] age was done he just raised up another
[1:48:10] one and when that one was done he raised
[1:48:12] up another one and another and another
[1:48:14] and another and another and we come to
[1:48:18] now and you're the other other you're
[1:48:23] the remaining other you have a great
[1:48:26] family tree that's why I can say I'm not
[1:48:30] an American I'm a Christian I'm not a
[1:48:34] politic I'm a believer I'm not a race
[1:48:40] I'm a son of God I don't care what's
[1:48:43] happening in the world this world is not
[1:48:46] my home
[1:48:47] I'm just passing through my treasures
[1:48:51] are laid up somewhere beyond the blue
[1:48:53] I'm just trying to tell everybody about
[1:48:57] somebody who can help anybody
[1:48:59] [Music]

[1:50:41] a it's unlike a like we got one arm tied
[1:50:44] behind our back we've got a major
