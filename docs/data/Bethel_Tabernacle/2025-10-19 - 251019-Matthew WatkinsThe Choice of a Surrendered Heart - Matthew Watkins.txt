TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[music] [music] Praise the Lord. I was going to read uh the book of Psalms 124 [music] if you want to find it. We just all stand and have a prayer. [snorts] You happy to be in the house of [music] the Lord tonight? Amen. God is good. The book of Psalms 124 reads on this wise. It says, "If it had not been so, if it had not been the Lord who was on our side, now may Israel say, if it had not been the Lord who was on our side, when men rose up against us, [music] then they had swallowed us up quick, but their wrath was kindled against us. When the waters had [music] overwhelmed us, the stream had gone over our soul. Then the proud waters had gone over our soul. Blessed be the Lord who hath gotten us as a prey to their teeth. Has not given us as a prey to their teeth. Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the followers. The snare is broken and we are escaped. Our help is in the name of the Lord who made heaven and earth. Amen. Aren't you glad for that as your help in the name of the Lord? Let's just bow our heads. Almighty God, Father, it's a privilege and an honor, Lord, to be able to come before your mighty throne tonight. Lord, I just pray that you would bless and anoint this worship service, Lord. Bless the word that comes forth tonight, Lord. May it be spoken, Lord, in such a way that we know that it's a living word. Lord, your words have life in them. Lord, they're not just like human words. Not just a noise with some [music] phonetics behind it that say something, Lord. Your words have more than just meaning, Lord, but your words have life. We just pray that tonight, Lord, your word would sink into the depths of our souls. Just watch over us tonight. Bless this service in a special way. Lord, we thank you so much for all that you are and all you do for us. In the wonderful and glorious name of Jesus Christ, we pray and ask. Amen. Quiet me. Let peaceful [music] [singing] waters flow and learn to be still. Oh my [music] soul and [music] let me [music] my Jesus walking near. Touch me Lord inqu [music] Oh my soul [music] And let me my [music] Jesus walk in near. Touch me [music] Lord and quiet me. [music] Quiet me. Let peaceful waters flow. Learn to be still, oh my soul, and let me hear my [music] Jesus. Walk in. Touch me Lord and quiet me. Sing it from the depths of your heart. From quiet [music] me. Let peaceful waters [music] flow and learn to be still. Oh my soul [music] and let me [singing] hear [music] my Jesus walking near. [music] Touch me Lord. Quiet me. Well, Luther, why don't you come on up and [music] we'll pray over the tithes and the offerings. Amen. Bless you, brother. Praise the Lord. There ain't nothing like just getting quiet in the presence of the Lord. Get your [music] spirit still. Get your mind still. Get rid of your devices. I'm not preaching tonight. Praise the Lord. [snorts] Amen. We all struggle with that, don't we? Amen. So, um, it gets a little slippery out on the concrete out here with the condensate water [music] on the concrete and stuff. So, just be careful out there. We don't want anyone to [music] get hurt in any way, shape, or form. I'm glad to be a Christian tonight. [music] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'm glad that he never leaves me nor forsakes me regardless of in spite of myself. [music] He looks beyond my faults and sees my needs. Let's pray. Father, I love you this evening, Lord. And Lord, [music] I'm eternally grateful and I'm grateful this evening, Father, for you and what your work does in my life. And Father, I [music] pray you forgive me for my many faults and failures, Father. Brother Donnie sings that song, Bars of Bone. And so many times, Father, I feel like I'm prisoned inside this old body, and I want to get out. I praise [music] you this evening, Lord, that we have an opportunity to just step aside from the cares and [music] busyness of life. Father, worship you in spirit and in truth. Was such a beautiful song, Lord. quiet me. How your presence just come down [music] and just you could feel the quietness settle in. And Lord, [music] we just praise and worship you this evening. We thank you for your grace and mercies to us. Father, as you spoke to Paul, your grace is sufficient, Father. We thank you for that. As we collect the tithes and offerings, we pray that you would bless the cheerful giver, Father. And Lord, just continue to be with us in [music] the service. We pray in Jesus name. Amen. For a long time [music] I've traveled down a long lonely road [music] where my heart was [singing] so heavy and sin I [music] sank low. But then I heard about [music] Jesus. [singing] What a wonderful hour. [music and singing] Oh, I'm so glad [music] that I found out he [singing] would bring me through his saving power. [music and singing] Aren't you glad you're free? Thank God I am [music] free. Free, free from this [music] world of sin. I've been washed in the blood of Jesus. I've been [music] born again. Hallelujah. Saved. [music] Saved. Saved by his wonderful [music] grace. Well, I'm so glad [music] that I found out that he would bring me out and show [music] me the way. [music] We're like the bird out of prison that [music] is taking its flight. [singing] Well, like a blind man that [music] got gave back his sight. [singing] [music] But like the poor wretched beggar [music] who's found fortune and fame. [music] I'm so glad that I found [music] out he could bring me out in his [singing] holy name. Sing it now. Thank God I am [music] free. Free, free from this [singing] world of sin. [music] Well, I've been washed in the blood of Jesus. I've been born [music] again. Well, hallelujah. [singing and music] I'm saved. Saved. Saved by his [music] wonderful [singing] grace. I'm so glad [music] that I found out he could bring me [music] out his holy name. For a long [music] time we've traveled. You feel like that sometimes down a [singing] long lonely [music] road where your heart gets so heavy and sin we [music] sank low.

[music] I'm so glad that I found out he could [music] bring me out his holy [singing] name. [music] Amen. Aren't you glad for that? Well, this world is not my home. I'm just a passing through. My treasures, [music] they're laid [singing] up somewhere beyond the blue. The [music] angels beckon me from heaven's open door. And I can't [music] feel Lord, you know. But I have no [music] friend like you. If heaven's [singing] not my home, [music] then Lord, what will I do? The angels beckon [music] me from heaven's open door when I can't feel at [music] home in this world anymore. Let's clap it now. Come on everybody. [music] [music] &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Well, they're all expecting me. And that's one thing [music] I know. I fixed it up with Jesus many years ago. I know that he'll see me through. Though [music] I am weak and poor when I can't feel at home in this world [music] anymore. Oh Lord, you know I have no friend like you. If heaven's [music] not my home, then Lord, what will I do? The angels beckoned [music] me from heaven's open door when I can't feel at [music] home in this world anymore. Just over in [music] the glory land. We live eternally. The saints on every hand. I'll shout in [music] the victory. The songs of sweetest praise drift back from heaven show. [music] And I can't feel at home in this world anymore. Let's clap [music] now. Come on.

If [music] heaven is [singing] not my home, then Lord, what will I do? The angels [music] beckon me from heaven's open door [music] when I can't feel at home in this world anymore. [music] Amen. You ever think about the words sometimes of these songs that we sing? Man, brother, you have a special [music] for us. Come on up. Y'all can be seated. &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; A thousand [music and singing] generations falling down in worship. Sing the [music and singing] song of ages to the land. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; All who've gone before us and all who [singing] will believe will sing the [music] song of ages to the land. Your [music] name is the highest. Your name is the [music] greatest. Your name stands [music and singing] above them all. All thrones and dominions, [music and singing] all powers and positions, your name stands [music and singing] above them all. And the angels [music and singing] cry, "Holy, [singing] all [music] creation cry, holy, you are lifted high. [music] Holy, holy forever. And if you've been forgiven [music] and if [singing] you've been redeemed, sing the song [singing] forever [music] to land. If you [music and singing] walk in freedom and if you bear his [singing] name, sing the song forever to the land. We'll sing the [music and singing] song forever and amen. And the angels [singing] cry, "Holy, all creation [singing] cries, holy, you are lifted high, [music] holy, [singing] holy forever. Hear your [music and singing] people sing. Holy.

Amen. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; comes and fear. Battles [music] rage within [singing] myself. I look to you, the mighty one. By your strength [music] I [singing] overcome. On [music] Christ [singing] I stand. For the battle [music] is the Lord's and by [singing] your hand my victory [music] is sure. Your [singing] greater still than the [music] struggle in my heart.

[music] What an awesome God you are. You're gater [music] still than the struggle in my heart. [music] What an awesome [singing] God you are. [music] [applause] Amen. Could we just stand and give the Lord another hand clap of [music] praise? You're worthy, Lord, of our praise. Oh yes. Give me a key of Jesus. Listen to these words sometimes and they don't even make sense. [music] There is a river that flows from deep within. There is a fountain that frees the [music] soul from sin. There's a river that flows from deep within. Think about that. Really? There's a river that flows [music] from deep within. [snorts] There is a river when it flows from deep [singing] within. [music] Aren't you glad for that? Well, there is a fountain and it frees the soul from sin. [music] Oh, come [singing] to these waters. There is a vast sublime. There is a river. Oh, think about this next [music] words. And it never shall run dry. There was [music] a thirsty woman [music] who was drawing from the well. Will her life [music] it was ruined oh and wasted. Think about it. [music] And her soul it was bound for hell. [music] But then she met the master [music and singing] who told [music] of her great sin. And he said, "If you drink from this [music] water, you will never thirst [music] again." There [music] came [singing] a sound from heaven. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; was a rushing [singing] mighty [music] wind. [music] Well, it filled [singing] all their hearts with singing [music] and it gave [music] them peace within. [music] The prophets gave [singing] the promise God's [music] spirit will descend. Thank [music] you Lord for that. Oh and from [singing] your inner being. [music] A [music] river with no end. [music] Well, there [singing] is [music] a river [music] and it flows from deep [music] within. There is a fountain [music] and it frees [music and singing] the soul from sin. Thank you Lord for that. [music] Oh, [singing] come to these [music] waters where there is a [music and singing] vast supply. [music] There is [music] a river when it never shall run dry. [music] Amen. Are you thankful that there is a river? Amen. Thank you, brother Brad, for that song. Just love that worship. Amen. [music] Are you glad to be a Christian tonight? Amen. Happy that you have the love of the Lord in your [music] heart. Amen. Without that, we wouldn't be here. Amen. Amen. God bless you. If you have your Bible, we'll turn to the book of [music] Genesis chapter 32. Amen. Genesis chapter 32. just like to [music] say to keep our pastor, my dad in prayer still recovering uh today and just spoke spoke to him today and um still sounds pretty uh under the weather but he's feeling a little better about 60% I think he said and so we just want to uh keep remembering him in prayer the Lord would just restore his strength and bring him amen to a a speedy recovery. all of those that are uh out maybe under the weather. I know a few are and then others traveling. We just want to be remembering them. Amen. Tonight, Genesis chapter 32, [clears throat] I want to minister to you on the choice of a surrendered heart. The choice of a surrendered heart. Why don't we just pick it up here? I'm just uh find a place and then I'll have you be seated, read a few scriptures. This is very familiar story of Jacob. I'm going to read and then we'll skip down. Verse one says, "And Jacob went on his way and the angels of God met him. And when Jacob saw them, he said, "This is God's host. And he called the name of the place, I'm not going to pronounce that right, but Mahanam." And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother, unto the land of Seier, the country of Edom. Let's just move on down. I'm just going to skip some of this, but we're going to go to verse 21. So went the present over before him, and himself lodged that night in the company. And he rose up that night, and took his two wives and his two woman servants, his 11 sons, and passed over the Ford Jabbach. Now, this is maybe a river you've never heard of before, and I hadn't either till I read this. He passed over the Ford Jabbach and he took them and sent them over the brook and sent over that he had. And notice this verse 24 very important first few words here. Verse 24. And Jacob was left alone. And Jacob was left alone. Sometimes God surrounds us with people. Other times he leaves us all by oursel. And sometimes that's where the true change takes place when we're all left alone. And there wrestled a man with him unto the breaking of the day. Verse 25. And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh. And the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint as he wrestled with him. And he said, "Let me go, for the day breakth." And he said, "I will not let thee go except thou bless me." And he said unto him, "What is thy name?" And he said, "Jacob." And he said, "Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but is actually God tells him what his name's going to be." But if you don't if you're not careful and you don't catch it, he's not actually renamed Israel here. This is speaking of what God's going to do in his life. Even after wrestling the angel, the real change hadn't taken place yet. The physical part had because when he leaves this wrestling match, he's limping. And for the rest of his life, he's going to walk with the limp. So notice his outward has changed, but his heart still hasn't changed. Let's keep reading here in verse 28. And he said, "Thy name shall no more be called Jacob, but Israel, for as a prince, thou has power with God and with men, and has prevailed." Jacob asked him and said, "Tell me, I pray thee thy name." And he said, "Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name?" And he blessed him there. And Jacob called the name of the place Penile, for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved. And as he passed over Panile, the sun rose upon him, and he halted upon his thigh. Therefore, the children of Israel, eat not of the sineu which shrank, which is upon the hollow of the thigh unto this day, because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh, and the senue that shrank. If you have a need, maybe something upon your heart, you just want to hold your hand up before the Lord. Why don't you just hold that knee up while we go before the Lord in prayer? Jesus, we're needy people. It's identified, Lord, here tonight in just the simple raising of our hands. How we need you, Lord. Lord, there's many, my dad even tonight, Lord, suffering still physically into the effects of some flu bug. Lord, we just pray that you would just be his healer tonight. Be his strength, Jesus. Touch him in his body, Lord. He's weary from, Lord, a lot of change and things happening. Lord, I pray that you just renew his strength, Lord. My mom also and our family, all of those, Lord, in our assembly, Lord, those that couldn't be here tonight. We pray, God, that you would just be near to them, Lord Jesus. And God, while we're here, we just ask that you would let us get oursel out of the way completely, Lord. Both hearer, Lord, and speaker, may we just move oursel aside, our own thoughts aside, Lord, and may you just come and speak a word to our hearts. We want to hear. We ask it in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. You can be seated. The choice of a surrendered heart. [snorts] It's amazing because you hear of this story here in Genesis and you hear of this river Jabbok. It's one that I maybe wasn't super familiar with. I'd read that passage in Genesis many times but never stopped to catch it. That this was actually going to speak to something very important in the spiritual journey of Jacob and to the spiritual journey of every believer. We know that the lives of the the the men's life that would be lived out in the Bible that the Apostle Paul would say that these things were written for our examples. Aren't you glad that others have lived lives before you and that now you can look at those as an example to know how to live your life? And the Bible, Paul would say that we wouldn't we would the things that they did that we seen that were godly, we follow after those kind of things. But the things that we seen that were ungodly, we shun from those kind of things. These things were written to the intent that we don't sin like they sin. That's what the apostle Paul said. And so Jbach is the place actually where Jacob wrestles the angel. It's a powerful life that you read about this man Jacob. And I think we can so relate to his life because Jacob was wasn't a a good man at all. In fact, we've said this many times before. Esau was a much better man than Jacob as far as what you would say from the outward qualities of a man. He was more honest. He was more uh uh you would say hospitable or kind or good-spirited. If you were to meet the two boys, you would think, "Boy, I really like that Esau. He's just a, you know, a guy I want to be around and someone that you really admire, you know, look up to maybe." as far as humanistic qualities, but we know that humanistic qualities is not what God is necessarily attracted to. And so from a humanistic standpoint, Esau was a much better man than Jacob. Jacob we know was his name would mean suppler. And that's not a word we use in our English today, but you would use the word con or or shyers, what brother Brandham actually calls him. He was a shyer. He was a man who didn't always do right. and his life is is chronicled and you could read that all the way through Jacob's life. It would be a a life that was riddled with a lot of uh mistakes, a lot of decisions that cost his not just himself but his own family, even his daughters and his sons. You know, it was his disobedience that led to uh many scars in his life because he never really had a surrendered heart. Brother [clears throat] Donnie and I'm just I sort of touched on this on uh Sunday and I just want to cover it just here just for a moment because there was so much of this that just so uh stuck with me out of uh the sermons that we read that we heard there at camp. One of the one of the sermons that so stuck with me was brother Donnie Saturday night all of them but when he ministered on the danger of an uncurrendered heart and he he distinguished something that I think I just want to bring uh here and the Lord just you know gave me this inspiration even from that sermon he preached on the danger of an unsurrendered heart and I'm te I'm preaching to you on the choice of a surrendered heart because a heart that surrenders is a choice And a heart that's not surrendered is also a choice. And he showed the difference or distinguish distinguished the difference between a lost heart, a lost heart, a heart that's lost, and a heart that isn't lost, but is uncurrendered. &gt;&gt; Because the lost heart, we could say, is very obvious. It's never accepted the Lord in their life. They're they're they're in their still in their sinful condition. But the uncurrendered heart exists within a person who maybe had a start for the Lord, maybe had an even an experience with God. You could uh even have something that you could look back to and look to a memory in your life and think, you know, of the time that God dealt with you and maybe you'd point to a youth camp or you'd point to a, you know, some kind of special meeting or some service where God met you in your life. Well, you know, and you could look at some of those experiences that you had, and you've always looked back at that one moment where you felt like something in your heart changed. Well, Jacob could look back at some of those very same supernatural experiences in his own life. We talked about it Sunday, even having a dream and seeing a ladder that goes from heaven and and angels descending and ascending. And further than that, God spoke to Jacob by through those angels appeared unto him and he's in, you know, such so such an awe by that experience that he anoints a pillar, a rock there. And he and he says, "This is the gate of heaven and the house of God." And he calls the name of that place Bethl. But the problem was is that though he had a great experience, he mistook that great experience for a changed or surrendered heart. And so he leaves from that place. And you can read your Bible that for 40 years God never you never records another thing in Jacob's life that God is appearing to him. He's serving the Lord. He's trusting God. He becomes actually an idol worshipper. Takes in idols in his own homes and and his wives, you know, you can read about it has those idols are worshiping those idols. some of the things he cast out before God gets a hold of him and he tells him to get rid of your earrings and and your and and your you know your idols and and build an altar. We preached on that on Sunday. But the that uncurrendered heart, Brother Donnie was speaking about is areas that that believers have given they've given, as brother Brandham said, they've given him their heart, &gt;&gt; but they there's parts of or places that they've never really given him full control. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many have heard the sermon brother Brandon preached? I'm sure al all as believers, most of us have heard the sermon brother Brandon preaches doors and door. He calls it door to the heart in another in another place. And you could hear brother Brandham as he begins to talk about that very same thought that that we accept him into our life. We accept him into our heart like we would accept a guest who comes knocking at our door and we allow them to come in and and you say, "Come on." And you might even invite them into the kitchen and say, "Would you like something to drink and are you thirsty and sit down, you know, in the living room?" And we what what are we doing? We're entertaining that guest. And the prophet uses that to teach us that that's how we can treat Christ. Sometimes we can invite him in and have a drink and entertain him and fellowship him. But with that guest, much like Christ, that's where we leave him. We don't let him go any further. You don't let that guest go into your, you know, into your bedroom, looking through your closets, underneath your bed. You won't even let him in your people in your cabinets sometime looking in there. But, but this is how Brother Brandham says how we treat Christ. with Christ. He's not just a guest who's there to visit us on the weekend, but we want him to live in the house &gt;&gt; and take up lordship and that that place of lordship over our life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Many people call him master. Even even Nicodemus says that good master. You know what that word master means? Teacher. That's what that's what he called him. Good teacher. you know teacher what must we do but there's a very big difference you notice he never called him lord &gt;&gt; many people could know him as good teacher good master but do you know him as lord &gt;&gt; he talked about that how that they've never came to a place of true surrender and and that that brother Donnie began to talk about the the dangerous misconception that has crept even into the message amongst believers that you know that when you believe or even when you're you know fil even you could say you know that that when you're filled with the Holy Ghost and when you believe on Christ that somehow you get it all that at that very moment when you surrender your heart and you say I surrendered my heart to the Lord that you've got salvation sanctification the Holy Ghost eternal security and that nothing can go wrong from that point on nothing can happen in your life as brother Donnie said that's a lie straight from the pits of hell a true Christian life is not about a one-time surrender. It's about a daily surrender, a daily dying out. Can you can you help me preach tonight? A daily emptying of yourself and a feeling of the goodness and the fullness of Christ. THE SPIRIT DRAWS YOU FIRST, but that's only the beginning of a liflong work. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. talked about Abraham's promises land that God had given him a promise but he didn't inherit it all at land and your seed shall possess the gate of the enemy and your your your seed shall be like the sand of the of the of the shore it shall be like the stars of the sky so there was the promise but Abraham didn't obtain it at that moment can you follow that he had to go on a journey to possess those things that God had promised him and so total obedience as the Philippians 2 I think it's verse 5 says let this mind &gt;&gt; which was in Christ be also in you &gt;&gt; allow it so there's a part of that surrender that that we had that that takes place in our own life &gt;&gt; Jacob as we come back to our text here came to that place where he wrestles with the Lord it's that place called Jabbach &gt;&gt; and the Bible says says it this way that that he's left alone. He's left alone all by himself [snorts] and go and and he's going to the Bible says in verse 22, I'm just going to read it. You don't have to turn. He rose up that night. We read it and and passed over the ford Jabbok. Now this word Jbach is interesting. It means a place of passing over. A place of passing over. It also secondarily means it stands for struggle. Think about that and hold that for a moment. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It means the place of struggle. He was going to struggle. God didn't int God intentionally brought him to this place of struggle. You've got to wrestle it out, Jacob. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; You've got to struggle with it. &gt;&gt; You've got to you've got to work this thing out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I I'm thinking I'm thinking of the words of of the Apostle Paul. when he says, "Work out your own salvation &gt;&gt; with fear &gt;&gt; and trembling." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right? And then right after that, he says, "For God workketh for you." It's a powerful thing when you contrast that. Work out your own for God workketh for you. So it's both parts. People say, "What is true surrender?" Well, true surrender has nothing to do with me. Oh yes, it does. True salvation isn't isn't isn't just falling on like quiet. You could study quietism and and it's it's the belief in many many books are written about it and part of part of part some approaches to Christianity is quietism where they believe that that all you really have to do is just surrender. And I'm preaching to you on surrender. &gt;&gt; Can I just take just a moment to to to lay this out here for you? There's a very big difference in in just we could say salvation that is all done by God or salvation that you work out yourself or salvation that is all you and not God at all. It's very very big contrast between them. In other words, what is my place in sanctification? &gt;&gt; Or is it that God does it all for me? Is there any such thing as is there any truth to true what you would call spiritual discipline in our life? &gt;&gt; Is there even such a thing as selfspiritual discipline? Well, let me read you the words of the Bible. The Bible says, "Gird up the loins of your mind." &gt;&gt; That sounds to me like something you got to do. Hello. &gt;&gt; In other words, pull in the loose ends of your own life. Gird them up. Gird them up. gard up the loins of your own mind. And so so we we would say what is the role, you know, in Philippians chapter 2, and you could read that in verse 12 and and verse 13. Why don't we look at that really quickly here just together, just trusting the Lord for this sermon here tonight. And so I just want to &gt;&gt; go at it go at the pace where he wants me here. Notice this is what we quoted. Wherefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, not only not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence. Notice, work out, this is Philippians 2:12, brother Josh, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. Verse 13, for it is God which workketh in you, &gt;&gt; both to will and to do of his good pleasure. So notice the contrast. Go back to the previous verse. Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. That's something I've got to do. The very next verse. For it is God which workketh in you. Aha. So it's him that does it through me. &gt;&gt; But what does it take? My surrender. &gt;&gt; Ain't that good? &gt;&gt; Notice this here. And so so you would say, is it me? Is it him? Is it faith? Is it effort? Is it works? Is it faith? Is it just obedience? And so you can see that there's as the prophet of God said, and I love this so much. He talks about that that you could never, and this is in no direct quote, but in in a in and let me just paraphrase something here that anytime you remove the mystery, then you remove the paradox. And with every believer, true believer who's really truly born again, there remains an element of a paradox of your life. &gt;&gt; In other words, a paradox is what? Something that can't be, but it is. &gt;&gt; So, Brother Brandon preaches the sermon called a paradox. Let me just sum it up to say that any true Christian who's born of a woman uh for born of a man and a woman by a sex desire and came into the world speaking lies and bred through uh problems and and family strains and complexes and fears and all of us got them. Anybody that is can take that kind of a vessel and really be born again by the spirit of God and yet have a nature change to desire the word of God to thirst for the word of God. You still got mistakes. YOU STILL GOT FAULT. YOU STILL FALL. YET YOU'RE BORN AGAIN OF THE SPIRIT of God. Yet you're at church on a Wednesday night with hands raised saying, "I want more of God." YET YOU'RE GOING TO WALK OUT THAT DOOR AND ALL OF US ARE GOING TO MAKE MISTAKES. We're all GOING TO STUMBLE. WE'RE ALL GOING TO TRIP UP. BUT ALL OF US WILL BE BACK HERE ON SUNDAY SAYING, "I I NEED MORE OF GOD. I WANT MORE OF GOD." WHAT IS IT? IT'S A PARADOX to the rest of THE WORLD. YOU SHOULDN'T BE A BELIEVER, but you are. &gt;&gt; Somebody ought to say hallelujah tonight. And so, so salvation, you could look at this as as this tension runs all the way throughout the Bible. Was it you? Was it God? You repented and believed. Yeah, it graces faith cometh uh you know, not of works but of grace, right? &gt;&gt; So, is it is it is it like brother Brandham said, was he was Jesus a man? Yes. Was he a god? Was he God? Yes. Well, which was it? He was a paradox. Amen. &gt;&gt; He was the God man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You You go take the book of Philippians. Can I ask you something? Who wrote the book of Philippians? Who wrote it? Paul. Hello. Come on. Got Christians here, right? None of y'all believe that Adam wrote that, right? Not Moses. It was Paul. &gt;&gt; But can I ask you who wrote it? You You read the book of Philippians. You see the heart of Paul. You see the inspiration of Paul. He mixes his own experience as a Jew in that book. &gt;&gt; Yet, CAN I JUST SAY IT WAS ALL OF PAUL, yet the Bible says that the scriptures were God breathed &gt;&gt; as men were moved on BY THE HOLY GHOST. SO, IT WASN'T PAUL'S WORD, IT WAS THE HOLY Ghost &gt;&gt; speaking through Paul. &gt;&gt; Yet, it was Paul. &gt;&gt; So, who wrote Philippians? Paul or the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; A paradox. &gt;&gt; It's God using the vessel that's surrendered to him. &gt;&gt; And so, let me just go in a little bit further. As we talked about quietism, it's just this and and we we we have it. There's parts of this that you could say would be true. You you have the song that we sing, let go and let God have his wonderful way. Well, that's quietism. Let go and let God. That mentality that takes it so far that it says just let go and let God. God's just going to do it all. All you got to do is surrender. I thought, brother Matt, that's what you're preaching. We we just have to surrender. But what role do we have &gt;&gt; in that surrender? Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh, you know, it's it becomes a very passive way at looking. Just yield, surrender. God does everything. And and and you you know, you you have phosphrases you'll hear like not I but Christ. You know, it's all Christ. It's just what Christ does. It's not him that runth or him that willth, but God that showeth mercy. God just does it all, brother. You just sit back, relax, and just surrender. &gt;&gt; But what does that mean? What part do I play in that? Are you Are you hearing me here tonight? because that's only half the verse. Paul says, Paul says, uh, I live yet not I, &gt;&gt; but Christ that liveth in me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, I live yet not I, Christ that liveth in me. &gt;&gt; And so, it's an effort to that that says we don't there's nothing we need to do uh, you know, of oursel. It's it's all Christ and and there's nothing we have. There's no part of that. There's no part, no role that we play in spiritual discipline. We just surrender our lives to God, get the Holy Ghost, and then God just does the rest. We just sit back and and I tell you where you end up. You end up just like Jacob. &gt;&gt; A lot of scars. Daughters that are uh you know uh d their lives are destroyed. sons become murderers because of that that her you know uh uh you know I don't want to get into it here tonight but some of the horrible things that happened to Dena Jacob's daughter and then the sons go to kill the go to kill the men so Jacob leaves after disobedience because he never surrendered his heart &gt;&gt; and it and his family he doesn't just live with the scars &gt;&gt; you see the danger of of an uncsured heart brothers can I just speak to you for a moment the danger of an uncured heart is all those who follow that uncsured heart and the collateral damage that followed Jacob's life would be worse in his wives and his his wife and his children. &gt;&gt; They lived with the scars in their own life of a father who never fully surrendered his heart. and and and you know the story he he ends up that way with just just a life that was never surrendered. Now on the other side of that you have pyotism. &gt;&gt; You know what that is? &gt;&gt; You know just work harder, do better, work harder, you know, just is we're just it's it's the thought or the belief that we can somehow work it all out oursel &gt;&gt; and we can be holy because of how we dress or how long our Don't smile. All listen friends, none of those things will get you in a rapture. &gt;&gt; If you want to talk about piety, go talk to a go talk to a, you know, a a hutterite or a Menite. Some of the most what you would call pious people that live holy lives, what we would call holy. None of that is going to get them in a rapture. The holiness that we need is, the Bible says, is be adorned with the holiness of the heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so pyotism on the other hand emphasizes personal effort, discipline, and obedience. And so it you say, "Brother Matt, well, do we believe that there's a part of this that we have to play?" Yes, there's a part in your own surrender that you have to play. There's a life of sanctification. Can we just get real simple here tonight? There's a dying out. And that dying out isn't just a fancy fancy cliche and you sit in a church service and we raise our hands and say, "I want to draw closer to the Lord." That's all well fine and good and wonderful. But if you don't put action to that prayer and start dying out by getting rid of things, cutting things off, I'm talking about very physical things and chopping off uh you know, friendships that aren't pleasing to God that lead you away from the from from the Lord. uh friendships or you know I don't care what you want to name friends family doesn't matter uh who it is or what it is things in our home things in our car things that we listen to things that we watch places that we go &gt;&gt; you'll never come to a surrendered heart if you're not willing to DO SOMETHING TO SURRENDER your heart &gt;&gt; and so so the scripture says in verse 12 again brother Joshua put it back up work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. Verse 13, for it is God which workketh in you both to will and to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; His good pleasure. And so I just want to move from that here just for a moment and come back to our our story of Jacob because he comes to this place that means a struggle uh uh to empty and to pour out. There's got to be a struggle. Life is about a struggle. Your Christian life is about a struggle. Your journey's about a struggle. You say, "What's the struggle, Brother Matt? Bills and and No, not the not that kind of a struggle. That's just the that's just the curse that we live in. The kind of struggle I'm talking about is the struggle with yourself, your nature, your will, your passion, your desire, your mind, those things which are contrary to God. Any thought that exalts itself above the knowledge of Christ, the struggle is is taking those thoughts captive and saying, "I'm not going to think those thoughts anymore, Lord. I'm not going to confess those thoughts anymore." uh the the the the struggle to spend time with the Lord, a daily walk with the Lord. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; That's the struggle I'm talking about. Jacob came to this place of struggle. That word Jbok also means to empty. To empty and to pour out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To empty and to pour out. This is the the place that so many of us need to come to. As the Lord just dealt with my heart this afternoon, this is the place where we come to the end of our self. &gt;&gt; And and and we've got, if you could just say it this way, YOU GOT TO HAVE IT OUT with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; H one onone a place where you're as Jacob was left alone. No church, no choir, no singers, no pastor, no prayer, nobody laying hands on you. The prophet of God would call it the backside of the desert experience &gt;&gt; where Moses had all of the intellect. He knew what the word was. He had all the he had all of the understanding of what his mother had taught him. &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God said he had all of his intellectuals and God had equipped him. But but he lacked that burning bush backside of the desert experience. &gt;&gt; Yet with all of his intellectuals, he was trying his best to live a Christian life. And the prophet of God said it this way. What good did all of his intellect get him? One dead Egyptian. &gt;&gt; That's all it produced. &gt;&gt; Same thing for the Apostle Paul. what it what it what it all of as knowledge and everything that he gained and everything that he learned and he comes to a place to where he says I count it all as dung for Christ &gt;&gt; I count it all as loss it got him nothing got him nowhere Jacob with all of your as we said Esau was a much better man Jacob was a terrible man a man who ran from God man who ran from the purpose of God or the plan of God for his life and and he comes to this spot of Jac Jabbach where he faces God for himself. It's a place of struggle. It's a place of pouring out and emptying out. It's a place of passing over, &gt;&gt; we could say. And it that that I think it's so powerful because you you think of the crossings of the Jordan. you think of and you hear that story and you think of the crossing of the Red Sea with Moses. There's two powerful places you could talk about in the scripture. One of them you could say symbolizes, you know, death, leaving Egypt, leaving the world, uh, you know, leaving sin and then then to cross the Red Sea would be to enter into the promise. Many who crossed the Red Sea never crossed the Jordan Sea. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. Many people left Egypt, but Egypt never left their heart. You could take them out of Egypt, but you got to get Egypt out of the person. &gt;&gt; Because many people left Egypt, but they never crossed the Jordan. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And can I SAY, BUT IT'S NOT JUST IT'S NOT JUST THE Red Sea that you need to cross. It's not just Jordan that you need to cross, but this this spot of Jabbok, not just a spiritual land, a promised land of blessing or salvation, being baptized or filled with the Holy Ghost. Uh uh all of those things are essential. But we hear so much about this word surrender. You say, "Brother Matt, you preach about surrender, but really what does it mean to say I surrender my heart?" As brother Donnie preached on the danger of an unsurrendered heart. How do I what is surrender? What does it mean in literal terms? The dictionary says it means to give up something to another person. It also means to relinquish something that was granted to you. This could mean possession, could mean power, it could mean your goal, your ambition, your desire, your drive, even your life. &gt;&gt; To give something, to surrender your life, to surrender something. But but we so so we talk about this. What does a surrender mean? But but but let me just say this. The surrendered life is the act of giving your life back to the one who granted you your life. &gt;&gt; It's relinquishing control. &gt;&gt; It's totally all power, all direction, all authority. It's totally resigning your life over to his hands &gt;&gt; to do as he [snorts] pleases. Jesus comes to a spot in his life in John verse chapter 6 verse 38. He says, "I came down from heaven." You know this very well. John 63838 brother Josh he says I came from heaven not to do notice not his own will not what he wanted his earthly desire his earthly ambition that he had as a human but he says not to do my own will but the will of him that sent me &gt;&gt; he says in chapter 8 and verse 50 I seek not my own glory I just want to say it this way Jesus did nothing for himself. He he made of himself, the Bible says, of no rep uh uh reputation. He took him took upon himself the form of a servant. Made himself of no reputation. He made no move. He spoke no word. He went no place except the father led him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Except he had instructions. I'm preaching to you on what a surrendered life looks like. &gt;&gt; How many want it? &gt;&gt; This is what it looks like. I do nothing. He says in chapter 8 verse 28, I do nothing of myself, but as my father hath taught me, I speak these things, for I do always that which pleases him. &gt;&gt; So you can see this humanity that came under surrender. Very different than Jacob. &gt;&gt; Uh but but a a clay that came under the full surrender to the potter and and and he and he and you say, "Well, Jesus was God in flesh, brother Matt." You know, come on. You're talking about the Emmanuel. His blood flowed through. Emanuel's God's blood flowed. Let me tell you something, FRIENDS. GOD NEVER came to be a human TO SHOW YOU WHAT GOD HOW GOD CAN OVERCOME. HE CAME AS a man to SHOW YOU HOW A MAN CAN OVERCOME the world. HE WAS FULLY GOD. HE WAS FULLY MAN. AND HE WAS MADE A HIGH PRIEST. HE WAS MADE UH h you know in every form. Everything the prophet OF GOD SAID. AND HOW DO I OVERCOME EVERYTHING you could be tempted with in your human life? Jesus suffered that temptation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. women. Brother Brandham says, alcohol, drugs, all of those things that you could ever suffer in temptation, Christ suffered it, was tempted by it, and overcame it. &gt;&gt; He says, you say he was well, he was, you know, you're talking about the blood of God, but he came to earth to live not as God, but as a human being. He experienced life. Can I say it to you this way? In the same exact way that you experience life, he experienced depression, anxiety, trouble, oppression to the place where angels would have to come and minister to his spirit because he was so low. Then he would say that my my the you know my my uh the spirit is he his spirit was heavy under great heaviness and and but yet he he he he surrendered his life. He says here in John chapter 10 verse1 17, therefore doth my father love me. Notice this is verse 17, brother Josh of chapter 10. Therefore doth my father love me because I laid down my life. Can I just say this to you here today? The the surrender that Jesus had to the father was not forced upon him &gt;&gt; by his father but he chose to surrender his life. Amen. The surrendered life is not imposed on anyone. It's not forced upon anyone. &gt;&gt; It's not even asked. Listen to me friends. This is this is so powerful when you when you catch this. The way just the way that the even the scripture just makes it so clear. Therefore doth my father love me because I laid down my life that I might take it again. Notice no man taketh it from me. But he wanted to make this clear. But I lay it down of myself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I have power to lay it down and I have power to take it up again. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In other words, Jesus was saying, "This is an act of self surrender that's totally within my power to either deny or accept." &gt;&gt; This is my choice. I hope you're catching this here tonight. And I'm not doing this because someone told me. I'm not doing this because the father forced me. I want you to know I'm doing this of my own accord. I'm choosing to lay my I have the privilege over my life. Brother Brandham said he had that right as a man to live his own life to search his own dreams. But he chose as a man because of you and me the joy that was set before him. He chose to lay down his life. &gt;&gt; I love this. And he says, "And I have the power to take it up again. So nobody's taking my life from me. He also gave me, listen, Jesus says, "If it be thy will, &gt;&gt; let this cup pass from me." Nevertheless, not my will, &gt;&gt; but thine be done. &gt;&gt; I choose to do it. I choose it out of love and surrender to him. So, can I just say this to you? God isn't going to force a surrendered life upon you. This is really what caught me and the inspiration I want to make sure I convey to you here tonight. No one's forced. I think of the words of Danny Henry. You know that prophecy that come over brother Brandham's life very well. And when that interpretation comes, it says because you have chosen the harder way. Because you, how many remember this? &gt;&gt; Because you have chosen the harder way. [snorts] I'm failing to recall exactly exact words there, but he says because you chose the harder way. And he says, and it notice it wasn't wasn't it wasn't forced upon him. It wasn't even pressured upon him. And in fact, God could have given him a good life even beyond that. But he says because you have chosen the harder way. And he says, "And it's my way." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he says, "Thou has chosen," this is his words, "the precise." &gt;&gt; Love that. and correct way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you have chosen. I DIDN'T FORCE YOU. I DIDN'T PRESSURE YOU. NO ONE MADE YOU. IT WASN'T FOR FAME. I promise you that. IT WASN'T FOR POPULARITY. THERE WAS MANY MEN who who DIDN'T CHOOSE THAT WAY THAT WERE a lot more popular than him. HE HAD DOORS CLOSED ON HIM, HAD FRIENDS WALK AWAY FROM HIM, HAD HIS FAMILY WALK AWAY FROM HIM. BUT I WANT TO TELL YOU WHAT HE CHOSE. THE PRECISE DECISION. BECAUSE IT WAS the same decision that Jesus made when he lived his life. It was the same decision Paul made when he lived his life that said IT'S NOT I THAT I MAY KNOW CHRIST AND THE POWER OF HIS RESURRECTION AND the fellowship of his sufferings to be made conformable unto his death. And brother and the PROPHECY SAYS BECAUSE YOU HAVE CHOSEN THAT A GREAT PORTION of heaven awaits you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It was his surrender. God didn't force him to do it. It was his choice. God leaves that choice up to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can look at the life of the Apostle Paul. I have so much here. I'm never going to get to all of it. So, you just forgive me as I just get to the spot that I that I believe the Lord is calling me to get to and then we'll move past that. It was actually the life of the Apostle Paul that had a fully surrendered life. This is so amazing. And I'm just gonna I'm just going to get into just a piece of this just here for a moment and then uh what we don't get to we'll just leave to the Lord. But it's amazing because Paul had everything. He was a Jesus hater, self-righteous persecutor of the church, of the Christians. You know the story of Saul, he he literally uh you know ga uh gave consent and the scripture says he hated the church. He says I hated I hated them. I hated his followers. He was also a man of great education. He was greatly educated. Sat under the been trained by the best teachers of his time. Was a Pharisee as he says of the Pharisees. &gt;&gt; And he says I st I strove I forget the way he SAYS THAT I LABORED MORE THAN ALL. &gt;&gt; He he was zealous of all Jewish leaders. He was more zealous and he was on his way to success. He was climbing the ladder. You could say he had the acceptance of the religious school of that day. He had a clear mission. He had, you know, uh, uh, accolades from all of his superiors and patted him on the back. You're doing the right thing, Saul. You got your whole life planned out before you. You live a nice comfortable life and not a lot of trouble, a lot of money, anything you want in life. This was the life of the first church age messenger. His whole life planned out, knew exactly where he was going. I promise you this. He was confident that he was in the will of God at that moment in his own mind of his uncurrentered heart. Remember how brother brother Donnie showed us that as Peter thought he WAS JUST FINE. LORD, I'LL NEVER DENY YOU THOUGH ALL MEN walk away from you. He says, "I'll never deny you, Lord." And he didn't see his own heart wasn't even converted. Because just a few chapters later, he's denying that he even knows and cussing, using profanity to try to distance himself. Yet when one moment, I'll never deny you, Lord. Though all men walk away from you, Lord, I'll never deny you. He didn't discern, as brother Donnie said, he didn't discern his own heart. I promise you, Paul, Saul of Tarsus thought he was he was in the will of God, doing the work of God, headed for success. And so what is the first thing God has to do? I'll tell you what. It's the first thing God has to do to get a heart surrendered to him. He had to knock him off of his high horse. [laughter] &gt;&gt; The first thing he had to do is knock him off of his horse, blind him. And to where he could lift up and say, "Who are who are you, Lord?" Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? Who are you, Lord? I'm Jesus whom thou persecutest. And that man who was so self-reliant, self-built, self-made, self-success became one of the most surrendered vessels &gt;&gt; in your Bible. &gt;&gt; He became one of the most self reliant, Godfilled, God dependent. And for everything, God led. In fact, Paul declared his life a pattern for all who desired to live fully surrendered to Christ. He says in 1 Timothy 1, "For this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might show forth all longsuffering." 1 Timothy 1:16, "For a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting." So, so in other words, Paul says, "If you want to know what a surrendered life looks like, look at mine. &gt;&gt; Follow me as I follow Christ." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You want to have your heart set to go deeper in Christ, here's what you can expect. Expect to live a life like me. &gt;&gt; Now, that's big. &gt;&gt; You see how the the the mood just changed right there? &gt;&gt; I want to be like Paul. &gt;&gt; I want to have a heart surrendered like Paul. Okay, let me tell you what Paul's life looked like. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you what he endured. I WANT TO BE LIKE BROTHER BRANDHAM. I WANT TO LIVE LIKE A HEART LIKE BROTHER BRANDHAM SURRENDERED. OKAY, let's talk about his loss. &gt;&gt; Let's talk about his children. Let's talk about his life story. Hello, somebody. &gt;&gt; He lived such a surrendered life to God. I think this is just so powerful. Such a surrendered life to God. I'm just going to catch my place here. I just had something I wanted to read. Brother Adam says, "And behold, and behold, I stand at the door and knock in 1958." He says here, "He cannot save you." Listen, he cannot save you against your will. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen, young people, he cannot save you against your will. He won't override your human will. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's not going to force himself into your heart. The prophet of God said it this way. He'll take as much as you give him. &gt;&gt; And if all we're going to give him is 10%, he'll take it. &gt;&gt; He deserves more, but he'll take what you give him. Can I go further? &gt;&gt; He can't heal you against your will. You've got to be willing to open the door and invite him in. I just want to invite him in. in a paradox 1965. You have you do have something into it. You say, "What do I have in all of this Christian life? What part do I play, brother Matt?" Well, let's let a a vindicated prophet tell us. &gt;&gt; You do have something into it. That's your surrender of your own will to the will and any and an idea, brother Brandham says, of Almighty God, it's finished. That's all there is to it. Perseverance 1962. You've got to surrender yourself. Got to give yourself completely to God. You've got to give, you've got to obey every bit of the word. Sell out completely. Unfelling realities. He says God wants a complete surrender. How can he show you realities before you surrender yourself to him? You've got to surrender. But surrender comes at a cost. It doesn't cost you, brother says in the uncertain sound. It doesn't cost you one thing. The only thing it cost you is just to surrender your life to him and receive it. Just forget all you ever knowed and surrender yourself to him. I could read many, many, many more of these and I just don't I won't just to save time. You love the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to get to something here and I want to make sure I don't miss it before we run out of time. This pathway that led the Apostle Paul to a fully surrendered heart. Can I just say it to you this way? The path to surrender un is the key that unlocks true contentment &gt;&gt; in life. path. &gt;&gt; You see, so many believers live, we live in such sometimes dis such discontent. If we're not careful, friends, we'll be honest. All of us can be discontent. Amen. It's true. I'll raise both my hands for you that aren't willing. We can all be discontent, unsatisfied. We God can give us so much, do so much for us, testify only for just 12 months later and we're, you know, wy wousy woo as brother Jules says and ain't got nothing and ain't got nobody and God never does anything for me. Friends, if we'd be honest, we can all get to that place to where even after we get so far down the road, we can become so discontent, never satisfied with what we have, forever looking to the future and what's next. And I'm all for that. But if that's all we if that's all we do IS JUST LOOK TO WHAT CAN I DO? What can I get next? WE MISS WHAT GOD HAS DONE AND WHAT GOD IS DOING RIGHT NOW IN OUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; DON'T LET THE DEVIL GET YOU TO LIVING TOMORROW. Live today. &gt;&gt; Living today. If I could just do this, if I could do that, I'll be happy. And it is chase that fulfillment. And that fulfillment never comes. It's exactly what Paul had to come to in his own life. A great test God brought him to. God said, he says he's a chosen. Acts 9:15, a chosen vessel unto me to bear my name before the Gentiles and kings and the children of Israel. And so here Paul receives this commission. Here's the commission. You ready? Paul, you're going to stand before kings. Wow. Me, Lord, I'm going to stand before great men and rulers. What if God told you that? What if God gave you that kind of a promise? I'm going to lead you to such a place in your ministry. You're a chosen vessel unto me and you'll stand before kings. You can imagine. And right away, the Bible says straightway he preached Christ. Right after he received that commission, it says, "I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision." And he preaches that commission of Christ. Preaches Christ to the Gentiles. The Bible says straightway he preached Christ in the synagogues that he's the son of God. He he becomes bolder. He a and as God grew as you know in the faith the Bible says he increased in more strength confounded the Jews which dwelt at Damascus that's chapter nine of acts pro proving that this is the very Christ so he preaches he gets a commission he wasn't disobedient to the heavenly VISION HE PREACHES CHRIST HE HAS THIS GREAT COMMISSION AND THEN WHAT IS THE VERY NEXT THING THAT HAPPENS THE JEWS TAKE A COUNSEL to say we got to kill that man and NOW HE'S GOT A DEATH THREAT OH, HIS LIFE. YOU MEAN THIS IS WHAT I get for preaching Christ? They're going to try to kill me. Yeah. Jesus said they hated me. They will hate you. &gt;&gt; If they persecuted me. Somebody help me preach. &gt;&gt; They will persecute you. Come on, somebody. If you're really living a Christian life, it will not be one that everybody just admires and just accepts and YOU JUST GET SOCIALLY POPULAR AND THOUSANDS OF FOLLOWERS. YOU MIGHT do that live in a hybrid version of Christianity. But I tell you what, it got Paul. It got him cru. It got his HEAD CUT OFF. IT GOT JESUS CRUCIFIED. BUT I'M HERE TO SAY, I'M not ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ. I'M NOT HERE TO MODERNIZE IT, POPULARIZE IT, MAKE IT MORE PALPABLE FOR SINNERS. I'M HERE TO BE IDENTIFIED WITH THAT GOSPEL. &gt;&gt; He's he's he's he's told you're going to get we're going to kill him right after this sermon. The Bible says the Jews conspired. I think that's so amazing. They conspire to kill him. They take counsel so much for that great call to preach the gospel to Israel, to the Jews. They run him out of their city and they reject his message. Not only is it one thing to say, "Get out. We don't want you to come back." But also to say, "We're going to kill that man. We're going to we're going to take his life." And so he he runs from there and and you could say, "Boy, what a start to that ministry, man. and you got this commission and the next thing at your first meeting you ran out of town and you're getting chased. You sure you're doing right, Paul? You sure you are you sure you heard from God? &gt;&gt; So he goes to Jerusalem. You know what he wants to do? He says, "I want to meet the discip I want to meet Jesus's disciples. I want to meet him for myself." The Bible says in verse chapter nine of acts verse 26 brother Josh but they were all afraid of him and believed not what he was that he was a discipleh he say to join himself to disciples but they were afraid of him and believed not that he was a disciple. So now you've been rejected. It's one thing to get rejected by the world. It's another thing to get rejected by the brothers and sisters in the church. &gt;&gt; They were afraid. Didn't want him. So So I went to the Jews. I went to the brothers. Finally, alas, I'll turn to the Gentiles. Yet, here's Cornelius and his house. And and and it's not Paul. It's Peter who unlocks the door to the Gentiles &gt;&gt; and preaches the Holy Ghost. And Cornelius, as we preached about it Sunday, his entire house, he didn't ask for Paul, he asked for Peter. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; You know, you I just got to be natural here. You don't think that that that Paul heard of that? think I thought I was given the commission. I thought the angel appeared to me and yet here's Peter over here and man, Lord, what did you even call me? Did I even hear from you in the first place? Not accept it. I tell you what it was. It was God's leading a man to full surrender. &gt;&gt; You're not going to be popular. You're not going to be accepted. You're not going to be loved if you want to live this life of surrender. I almost titled my sermon that here tonight the surrendered life because this is what it looks like. They they they they ran him out a afterwards. Then he goes there and so Paul he goes to to uh you know I just want to skip some of these notes here. And so you can imagine what is going through his mind. The disappointment the the the lackluster start of what you would call the pain the threats to his life. But God was teaching Paul one step at a time, one trial at a time, how to be content with whatever the Lord gives you. How to be content. He preaches in Antioch in Acts chapter 13 verse. I'm just going to go. Can I have just a five more minutes here? &gt;&gt; I don't even know how long. It's 8:34. So, just give me a few more minutes. He preaches in Antioch. We know this. And he says in Acts 13:46, "Lo, we turn to the Gentiles." And the word of the Lord is published. Verse 48, "Throughout all of the reason region, it says that yet the Jews stirred up the devout and honorable women and raised persecution against Paul." This is verse 50, "Against Paul and Barnabas and expelled them out of their course." I know you you think maybe like me and you think Paul had this wonderful you know lustrous career of preaching you know not career but ministry of preaching and he was just m preached in 10 revival and thousands of people and everybody just love I mean come on we're talking about the writer of the New Testament here no when you ACTUALLY READ HIS LIFE IT WAS A LIFE OF A LOT OF REJECTION NO FRIENDS &gt;&gt; HE SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN prison [laughter] &gt;&gt; he had a good prison ministry Yeah. Had a really good prison ministry. And he he he goes from there and and and and the Bible says here in chapter 14, he says there was an assault made both of the Gentiles also the Jews with their rulers. Could you imagine the discouragement, the confusion that comes over the Apostle Paul? It's the same way for God's prophets. Same way for brother Brandon. parallels between the alpha messenger and the omega messenger, the first church age messenger, the Paul and the last brother Brandham. The parallels between both of them, as brother Brandham tells us in the church age book, those messengers will try to be like the apostle Paul. They will try to approximate his ministry, but I say none of them more so than the last messenger. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and the and you can imagine the discouragement. You can imagine trying to make sense out of all of this. And every turn he's trying to do something for God and there's a objection, there's a hindrance and they something's preventing it. And then he's he's shipwreck and he's, you know, he's he's put in prison. He's tried stone almost stoned to death and he just keeps going, keeps persevering, keeps going, keeps persevering, doesn't give up, doesn't question God, just keeps on preaching the gospel &gt;&gt; and at every turn. But God promised him a ministry. Listen to this. Yet he was cursed, rejected, assaulted physically, &gt;&gt; stoned physically, &gt;&gt; AND HOW DID YOU RESPOND? HOW does a surrendered life respond? Philippians 4:1, I have learned in whatsoever state I am. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Therewith to be content. You didn't question it. You won't find it. I don't find it. No. Nowhere do I find Paul lamenting, complaining. Why me, Lord? He says, I've learned. That's an important key. &gt;&gt; He didn't just get it overnight, but he learned in whatsoever state. Philippians 4:11, brother Josh, in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content. He didn't demand, you know, we make demands of God. Paul didn't demand anything. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God, I gave my life. You owe me. You better do the God. Paul never demanded anything from God. Yeah. God promised you I promise you to stand before kings and rulers. You know, but I never find it in my Bible going, "Hey, God, what about that uh that thing there? You know, I'm getting stoned and you said I would preach for kings, rulers." He never brought it up. never never talked about it. You know what it was? Is that Paul was in no hurry to see the fulfillment of everything God said in his life. He was in no hurry. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He knew God would keep his word even if it was one day at a time. &gt;&gt; We get so much in a hurry. God, you promised this and you promised that and you promised THIS TO ME. BUT Paul learned, I'm not going to get in the hurry. God's faithful. God's faithful. I'm going to keep pressing. I'm going to keep believing. I'm going to keep preaching. I'm going to keep pursuing. He will, as Paul says, he will keep the thing that he's promised unto me unto the day. God will be faithful over those things which he has promised. He knew he had a promise from God. And at that moment, it wasn't real. It didn't look real. It didn't look possible. But he learned to be content to minister wherever he was to whoever he could preach to. Didn't have to be rulers. It didn't have TO BE GREAT CROWDS and thousands of people. Oh, come on. Come on. Can I get somebody to say, "Let me be that kind of a faithful servant." IT DIDN'T MATTER WHO'D YOU PREACH TO, PAUL. SELLERS, &gt;&gt; INMATES, &gt;&gt; JEELLERS. &gt;&gt; WHERE'S YOUR CROWDS? WHERE'S YOUR BIG MINISTRY? UH, YOU KNOW, WHERE'S ALL THOSE THINGS? HIM ON THE ON THE RIVER BANK. WHAT WAS IT? HE HAD A COMMISSION ON ON HIS LIFE AND HE WAS GOING TO BE F FAITHFUL TO SAY, "GOD, IT DOESN'T MATTER. I JUST WANT TO BE faithful to my commission you've placed in my life." I want to say, "Lord, let me be faithful. If it's to two, if it's to three, if it's just small, no matter what it looks like, let me be faithful in that commission. Lord, let me be faithful. Not jealous of others. maybe others he could be jealous of ministries that he could look at. Paul says in 1 Timothy 6, brother Josh verse 6, I love this. Just a few more verses and I'm going to I'm going to close. I promise. He says godliness with contentment. This is 1 Timothy 6:6. Godliness with How many want to be godly? &gt;&gt; But godliness with contentment &gt;&gt; is great gain. He says in ver and having food and raignment verse you can keep going. It might be verse eight verse seven or verse eight. Brother Josh go to the next verse. And having food and raignment there having food and raignment let us be therewith content. &gt;&gt; What what's up Paul? What's up with your life? I mean you're at the end of your journey. You have no savings. You have no retirement. You have no house. You have no investment. And God promised you, God appeared to you, an angel. Okay? You know, all you have is food and clothing, a change of clothes, that's all you got? I tell you what, Paul's answer would be, "Oh, I got so much more than that. &gt;&gt; I have one Christ, &gt;&gt; and that's all that matters. I have what real life is." Oh, BUT THE DEVIL'S AL ALWAYS COMING AFTER YOU, PAUL. No one likes you, Paul. You live in constant pain. You even got a physical issue in your stomach. BOTHERS YOU ALL THE TIME. GOD, AFTER ALL YOU'VE GIVEN TO GOD, AND GOD, you've prayed and prayed AND PRAYED AND AND GOD'S not going to take that. YOU KNOW WHAT ABOUT THAT, PAUL? What about what about all THAT CONSTANT PAIN? IN FACT, YOU SUFFER LIKE NO ONE ELSE SUFFERS, PAUL. HOW COULD YOU TRULY UH BE WITH ALL THOSE AFFLICTIONS BE TRULY CALLED OF GOD? I'LL GIVE YOU THE WORDS OF PAUL. I GLORY IN MY AFFLICTIONS. FOR WHEN I AM WEAK, THAT'S WHEN HE IS MADE STRONG. I don't measure my strength by the world's standards. I measure my strength by God's word. &gt;&gt; This was the end of his life. This is what a true surrendered life musicians come looks like. I thought you said you'd witness to kings. He did. He stood before kings. The only part God didn't show him is that he would have a ball in chains when he ministered before kings. He'd be an inmate, locked up. Paul a prisoner not of men but of Christ. Could you bow your heads with me here tonight? Every head bowed. You could just play something softly. Brother and sister Deborah. What about it, Paul? What about your life? Have you learned [music] in whatever state you find yourself [music] there with to be content? You have a choice. We have a choice. I just want to say something so simple, so simple. It just strikes me right now. Brothers, sisters, men, women, young people, it applies to old, young. God doesn't What is What does God ask of us? Think about that just for a moment. What's God asked of you? You ever thought about that? What's he a what has he asked of your life? Has he asked you to give your riches? Have he has he asked you to gain riches? Is that what God asked you to do? Did he ask you to rise to the [music] top of business and success? Did he ask you to chase, reach, [music] dream? No, actually all God asked was for your heart. That's all. All he asks for is your heart. That's it. That's all. Just your heart fully surrendered. That's all he asks. Wonder if we could by an uplifted hand, nobody looking around, we could just say, "Lord, I want to give you my heart fully [music] surrendered to your purpose." Whatever that [music] means for you, friend, might mean something different for me. But whatever that means for you, God knows. Will you give him your heart fully surrendered? He don't make you. He don't force you. He don't even pressure you. You give him 10%, he'll take it. [music] Give him half of it, he'll take it. He'll live there. But what he wants is all of you. I'd invite you tonight just to stand to your feet with your hands raised and say, "God, I want to give it all to you. All to Jesus. All to him. I fully give. That's my desire. Lord, I have my hands raised [music] on this Wednesday night. Service, Lord. Simple. just want our heart, our ambitions. What does it really mean if it has no eternal value? Paul knew he had didn't have a lot of earthly riches or treasures. Oh, but he was taken to the third heaven. He seen things that aren't lawful to be uttered. And when he got back as your prophet was, he was changed never to be the same cuz he seen that it's not this world. It's not [music] this life that that we're even living for. But our treasures [music] are laid up. Our heart, our true heart, Jesus [music] said, out of the where your treasure is, there your heart is also. And where [music] Paul's heart was was not this world, not this life. For he said, for it's better for me that I go, better for you that I stay. It's better for me that I go. Let me come to that place of my own life, Jesus. For nothing matters really, but you. All that really counts, all that's really true. When it's all been said and done, as the song says, did I live my life for truth? Did I live my life for you? When it's all been said and done, when all the dust is settled, when my life is over, what will I look back, [music] Lord, to things that I held so dear, were they really true? Things that I held so close, were they really eternal? or did I neglect those things that have the most value? I pray God [music] that you would help us Lord even in our daily priorities, our daily responsibilities. I want to put you first Lord. Yes, Jesus. All to Jesus [music] I surrender. [music] All to him I freely. [music] I will ever love and [music] trust in me. his presence daily. &gt;&gt; Make [music] it light prayer now. Oh, I [singing] surrender all. &gt;&gt; It's [music] an old song, but it's good. I [singing] Oh, lift it up to him like a prayer. All [music] all [singing] to thee my blessed [music] Savior I surrender. &gt;&gt; Come and gather with me to the front. I [music] surrender all. I [singing] surrender all. I surrender [singing] [music] all. [music] Yes, Lord. To thee my blessed [singing] [music] Savior. I surrender [music] all. &gt;&gt; Could we sing that song? All that really counts. All that really matters. I wish I had brother Ken [music] here. He's not. I just want to sing that. had it upon my heart. All that really counts. All [music] that [singing] really counts. All that's really [music] true. Got the mic. &gt;&gt; All is [music] you. &gt;&gt; Everything to gain. Nothing now to lose. [music] All I ever really want. Can we go up? Go up. [music] &gt;&gt; All that really counts. [singing] All that's really true. [music] All [music] now [singing] is you. Oh, everything [music and singing] to gain. Nothing now to [music] lose. All I ever really [singing] want is you. Sing it [music] again now. Oh, all that counts. [singing] All [music] that's really true. And all [singing] that really matterers, Lord, is you [music] &gt;&gt; and everything to gain. Nothing else to lose. [music] All I ever read. You know the verse is you. Solomon [music] concluded Solomon concluded all his vanity. Now my heart [singing and music] believes that he is true. Took me all took [music] me all this time to find reality. When all I ever when all I ever [music] really want is you. [music] All that really counts, [singing] yes Lord, all [music] that's really true, all that really [music and singing] matterers now is you. Oh, [music] everything to gain, &gt;&gt; nothing [music] to lose. [singing] All I ever really want [music and singing] it's you. Give me a verse now on the second verse. So take [music] the grandest thing you know that life can give [music] and weigh it with &gt;&gt; [singing] &gt;&gt; eternity bright side. [music] One thing one thing I [singing] have learned in all this life I've [music] lived. There is truly that there is truly nothing good but God. [music] Oh all [singing] that really counts, [music] yes Lord, all that's really true and all that really [music and singing] matterers Lord is you. Oh, [music] everything to gain, [singing] nothing [music] now to lose, all [singing] I ever really want. [music] Brother George Buckman says, "Prayer request tonight for my cousin's husband, Steve Broom. He is [music] in St. Joseph's in Savannah. He just had his second shoulder reconstructive surgery after a fall, damaged, and broke the original. also suffering from advanced Parkinson's [music] and is being evaluated for possible stroke.

And God, your name is greater than any disease, any affliction bodily. Lord, you see these [music] requests. You're the high priest, Lord God, who can be touched by the feelings of our infirmities. Your prophet taught us, Lord, that we can't really pray for someone and unless we're able to enter into their suffering. So God, I think of this man, Steve Broom. [music] Lord Jesus, who's there in St. Joseph's Hospital, Hel and Debbie, coveting our prayers. I pray, God, that you would be mindful to him. Be merciful, oh God. Lord Jesus, we believe that prayer is the weapon [music] that we use to fight the enemy. So now God, the family of God is praying, [music] crying out to you. Come and fight the battle that we can't win. Do it, Lord Jesus, for this man. I pray that there would be a testimony that would [music] come from it.

Just just wanted to thank the Lord. Um, Monday morning, uh, we went took the trash. Um, and we're pulling in my road and there was this truck getting ready to pull out and he pulled out right into us and pitted us and and uh really the the biggest part and we're still waiting on insurance. We're just trusting the Lord that, you know, he's taking care of us. It works all things for our good. But &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; um um I was actually leaving the house after couple hours and getting everything all taken care of and I was able to thankfully drive the truck home even though the axle is, you know, but um so but I got to thinking when we left the house, you know, we had had this older car seat um that we had um gotten from a family here in the church and it was about to expire. So, I took the bottom portion off as a booster and I was she was four years old. I was thinking about using as a booster in the truck and um I had it in there and chested her [music] in it and I didn't really like the way that the seat belt kind of went across her. So, we ordered a new booster harness and that's what she was in. And I was like, "Thank God because you know that could have hurt her." So, Mindful. Praise God. [music] Thank you, Lord. [applause] Anybody else before we go? Testimony, nobody. Amen. We're going to let you be dismissed. Sister Jen. Yep. [music] Pass this on back to Sister Jennifer if you could. So, I know some of you guys [music] know I've been through a lot physically for the past few years, and the Lord's just been continue to give me my healing and help me to overcome. And I I made a promise to the devil that whenever I was struggling, I would make a point to give a testimony. So, I just wanted to thank the Lord for my continued healing. &gt;&gt; Amen. and um for the Lord just helping me to overcome little by little. &gt;&gt; Amen. [crying] &gt;&gt; Amen. [music] It's how you give the devil a black eye. &gt;&gt; Amen, sister Emily. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And um you you had me do the cameras and it was just when you were talking about the like the quality of the video and stuff. &gt;&gt; I was sitting there and I was like, "Well, we found this church online, you know, in [music] 2020. Yeah, &gt;&gt; we didn't know anybody here except for the demars. And then I'm I just I was just it was just like like full circle. And then I was doing the cameras actually Steve thought that like oh he stood back and saw me videoing. And the crazy thing is at when we first the first person I ever we didn't know any of the people any of the churches out here. We just were in our own little bubble kind of. And I somehow had gotten brother Donnie his [music] church. So I was like streaming. He was the only person I knew and brother Paul Hlet that's it. And it was just like so it was just like full circle and kind of cool that I was doing the cameras and I'm like this is our whole story. It's online. Um and then just a couple other things that the camp is so valuable. Um it's worth all the work. [music] I was thinking about Annaise a year ago coming to town to watch dogs and Rachel said you're an answer to prayer. And I thought, well, now I'm like, well, she was, but not about the dogs. Um, and that just is amazing. And then also like the first year of camp, Micah came to camp. You know, God touched him and he met Esther. And it's just our lives are so amazing. Um, from this being here and being at this church, and I'm just I'm so grateful. Um, gonna it's worth all the work, you guys. Camp's exhausting, but our lives have like never been better. This is such an amazing church. We're so happy to be here. &gt;&gt; We're so happy you're here, Lord. Amen. Don't you just love what God is doing in our lives? You believe the Lord cares? [music] &gt;&gt; Amen. About the little details. Amen. We're going to take uh no more. I guess we'll just uh stop there. All that really counts. All that's really true. All that [music and singing] really matterers. No. Can we sing it just before we go? Oh, everything [music] to gain, nothing now [music] to lose. All I ever really want is you. [music] God bless you. You can be dismissed. All that really counts. All that's really true, all [music] that really matterers, Lord, [singing] is you. everything [music and singing] to gain. &gt;&gt; All I [music] ever really want is you [music] really count. [singing] As long as it's really true, all that really [music and singing] matterers, Lord, is you. &gt;&gt; And everything [music] to gain, [singing] nothing down to lose. [music] All I really ever [singing] want is you. [music] Go ahead and sing. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Lord. [music]
