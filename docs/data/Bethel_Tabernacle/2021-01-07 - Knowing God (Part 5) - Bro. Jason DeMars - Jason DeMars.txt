thoughts and footsteps we ask it in jesus name amen amen you can be seated for a moment just want to make sure they have my powerpoint back there went to the email of course i'm sure everyone saw has seen what's going on in the capital of our country today and i don't comment on current events too much but i'll just say this that regardless of the rise and fall of nations and whatever happens in this country god's word will stand whether america's op vanishes off the face of the planet god's word stands and i'll go even further is that the true church of god it started under the roman empire right the roman empire got destroyed it got broken up it changed and what what's happening the true church of god the bride of christ is still standing is still going forward so regardless of what happens in this country i hope we're not too upset about what's going on in washington d.c i for one i i want to know what's happening in my world but i'll be frank with you i don't care i what i do care about is you about your soul what i do care about is being pleasing to god and honoring him regardless of what happens to this once great country that doesn't matter real really i mean we have to come to that place where we're not so worked up about what's happening with the politics that's this world our citizenship is in heaven and we need to align our thoughts our heart our attitudes with that and so just everybody calm down god is in control whatever you think about stolen elections and all the rhetoric that's going on both sides really that's irrelevant to god's purpose for you it may have some impact persecution and prison and suffering and pandemics yes they come and they go but god's word will stand and our obedience to the word is not based on circumstances easiness what it might be i i'm i'm i think what brother matt preached preached on last week was so incredibly profound and i think i hope if you didn't listen please i'm i'm begging you the last time you preached i think it was on wednesday brother matt go listen to that again because it's a it's a great kind of correction to the way of thinking that has gone forth in the message over the years so i'm not i'm not trying to what i'm saying i'm not trying to musicians you guys can go it's going to be a minute i love you guys thank you i'm not trying to come against that or say there's going to be a great persecution rise up what i'm trying to say is whatever happens wherever you are whatever country you are should not impact your faith in god and there is a there is a deceptive and evil american quote unquote gospel though it isn't a gospel at all it's demonic and it's so tied right now to donald trump and the republican party and i'm afraid many message believers have fallen prey to the deception and look i know donald trump has done good things some good things but he himself as a man is wicked and he's a narcissist and he's all about himself let let everyone be loyal to me and i'm i'm not going to be loyal to anyone else it's not the attribute the heart of a christian and people have had their faith so tied together to this political movement to this man that i'm sure they're very distraught and disappointed shame on us shame on us this word is our absolute and i know that everyone well of course i agree with that why don't you live it then i'm ju i just want to stand and rebuke the spirit of american politics that's gotten into the church to the message churches of today flee from that spirit it's nothing but death destruction and total deception do you have that power point otherwise i'm just gonna keep going all right i think that's well into it can we go back to the title screen it's saying it is number one all right i mean let's see that's my first scripture but there's supposed to be a title screen we're good we're good all right let's stand as we read the scripture deuteronomy 7 verse 9. know therefore that the lord thy god he is god the faithful god which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations amen can be seated i'm going to be speaking on the subject knowing god part five and we'll be looking at several attributes of god starting with the faithfulness of god and then the love of god and that probably will be as far as we get today the faithfulness of god well we live in a day that people barely mean what they say anymore they say something then they turn around and they do the very opposite thing people not only divorce in an instant but now they're so confident of unfaithfulness they often don't even get married at all and of course we we've all been unfaithful in our hearts to christ we've sinned against him that's that's clear as long as you're honest with yourself and not so full full of pride that you that you're blind but if you're honest with yourself you know that you sin the bible says he that says that he has no sin is a liar and the truth is not in him so i'm just saying if you think you don't have sin you're a liar which is a sin so you're a sinner anyway but where this is the world that we live in a world of unfaithfulness a world of dishonesty a world of calculated lying in our there's no such thing as faithfulness and honesty in politics even those who are extolling themselves as faithful and doing everything that they said they would do are not doing everything that they said they would do and that are lying constantly and whoever is the best and most convincing liar gets voted into political office the one that convinces everyone i'm not lying all the time that's who's going to be voted in we all know better we all know better but as christians we should be in the same characteristic as our god he's faithful he wants he calls us to be faithful so faithfulness is a quality that is absolutely essential to god's character god is always faithful to his word and he always fulfills his word second timothy 2 verse 13 if we believe not yet he abideth faithful he cannot deny himself that's that verse always really stuns me if we believe not yet he remains he continually stays faithful he cannot deny himself what does that last part have to do with the first part if we believe not then all of a sudden talks about how god's faithful and he cannot deny himself well maybe because we're a part of him and he's made a promise to to us that he's he that started a work will be faithful to complete it even when we go into places where we're living in and under unbelief god remains faithful he'll pull us he'll bring us to repentance he will fulfill his word for god to be unfaithful it would mean that he's not god he's it would mean that he's denying himself in other words god becoming an atheist so god is perfectly faithful in other words it's impossible for god to be unfaithful hebrews 6 18 that by two immutable things in which it was impossible for god to lie we might have a strong consolation who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us it's not even a possibility for god to lie and and we're gonna we're gonna talk about just for a little bit you know these places where we get into our lives and we're claiming god's promises and we don't see anything happening it seems like he's quiet he's silent all right we're going to talk about that but we should understand first god's character god's nature because when we get understand god's character and nature as a faithful god that issue should never come up in our hearts right psalms uh 30 6 5 says thy mercy o lord is in the heavens and thy faithfulness reaches unto the clouds amen it's vast it's vast it's something that we we can barely measure we can't even measure numbers 23 19 god is not a man that he should lie neither the son of man that he should repent hath he said and shall he not do it or hath he spoken and shall he not make it good amen god has over and over again fulfilled his word you know he said through isaiah behold a virgin shall conceive 800 years before a virgin did conceive he said after 400 he told abraham after 400 years i will deliver this people and he did exactly that hebrews hebrews 10 23 says he is faithful that promised always faithful that promised however as we said there's times in our life that god allows the circumstances to be set against us to test do we believe in his faithfulness you see we're we want instant answers and instant satisfaction to god's promises and god is a lot more patient than we are god has you know if you really understand god's attributes they all work perfectly together right god's faithfulness is also connected to god's knowledge or his wisdom right his his sovereign purpose is overseeing all of this so it's god's faithfulness is not a vending machine 25 cents in and you get your promise it's not of any vending machine god has purposes to fulfill on the earth and we can go through all redemption history and see abraham god gave him a promise you'd think well they're going to get a son right away it's like it just hung out there hung out there and hung out there and both of them even though god's memorial is that they were faithful because they obeyed mostly because they believed right because they had faith and yet it seemed many times they doubted but he is faithful that promised he cannot deny himself and so they laughed and they tried to make it come to pass their own way which is a danger for all of us god doesn't need our help he can bring it to pass perfectly on his own it's up to us to wait but he allows time to go by because he's trying our faith he's testing our faith why would he need to do that because when he tests our faith we grow muscles faith muscles right we sprout not you ladies but we men sprout faith hair on our chests right you know it's it's a brother branham says it's a burly faith if god when when you have children and you give them everything they want the minute they ask for it what happens what happens character is lacking character becomes weak and if god gave us everything that we asked for instantaneously when we asked what would it be we would be we would have a lack of character what is the thing that god wants in us most to see himself his character so therefore the faithful god says wait amen it says believe and i think brother brother travis and i were talking about this last night the greatest thing the greatest kind of faith is not the kind of faith that just pulls down miracles constantly we love that we want that not dismissing it whatsoever but the greatest kind of faith is when you see nothing and when you feel nothing you just hold on you just hold on fact not only when you see nothing when you see everything is contrary to what you're believing for it's exactly the opposite all evidence points to god is not faithful now again we talk about it in a doctrinal way and it seems what are you talking about all evidence points to god's faithful your nuts i'm talking about in your life in the times you've prayed for something and you've waited and you've agonized and you're probably in the many of us are in the middle of that now and god says wait i have something better for you and that's my life my character you know i mean let's just put it put it in terms newborn babies die stillborn mothers die children live dads leave big families behind pass away um relatives that we prayed for believe for uh we experience painful things us may a spouse dies or leave or leaves you or one of your children dies or you have a miscarriage what do you what what happens did i do something wrong and then you start to get this spirit of unbelief why would god do this if we understand god's character we understand god is good and god is always working for our good and we don't always understand what that is the the fact is god is doing tens of thousands of things in your life and you're only aware of a couple of them and and so the reality is we need to trust and i think it always amy played a song for me yesterday i think it always comes down to this when we come to this place where we're facing trials difficulties and then as a result doubt in god god comes to us with an answer in the book of job where were you when i laid the foundations of the earth when i stretched out and measured the sea and and he goes through all this vast detail of his incredible immense creation in other words be still and know that i am god my uh my aunt has a wonderful testimony about that verse she my long before i was born but my my cousin they were i'm trying to not cry too much so just i'm gonna breathe my my cousin was skiing down down down a big hill and there was lots of people not skiing sledding as a little little kid i think under six years old i don't remember the exact age she was in and as she was going down she stopped and kind of in the middle someone else came in head first just nailed her and went to the hospital and and died some hours later and it was just devastating for the whole family and uh my aunt seal she took her bible and and went to the psalms and saw that scripture be still and know that i am god and it's been our life verse ever since then and uh we don't understand we don't know why god does things sometimes but be still and know that he's god he's faithful and he loves you and he has a purpose and it hurts i know and he knows that when he hurts when you hurt he's hurting with you he cares you can put your cares on him and he'll take care of you don't give yourself over to that unbelief amen rebuke the devil he'll flee from you but take god's word for your life take this bible for your life for your comfort because god is faithful any of you know the story of william cooper he's the he's the one that wrote the the believe that's right he wrote the song there is a fountain filled with blood and he wrote the song god moves in in a mysterious way and he suffered from depression all his life terrible tried to kill himself multiple times and he he he loved the word of god and he loved god with all his heart but he constantly suffered from depression and through it all he leaned on god but he despaired of his own salvation constantly he believed with all his heart but he was in constant despair and he wrote these words and i think it's just knowing his background what what beautiful words he wrote there is a fountain filled with blood and but this hymn god moves in a mysterious way judge not the lord by feeble sense but trust him for his grace behind a frowning frowning providence he hides a smiling face his purposes will ripen fast unfolding every hour the bud may have a bitter taste but sweet will be the flower blind unbelief is sure to air and scan his work in god's work in vain god is his own interpreter and he will make it plain amen we don't always understand god's purposes but if we believe and we trust in his faithfulness no matter what we will have an answer we will see his great wisdom worked out in our lives through heartache and sorrow sin produces evil evil produces all kinds of suffering but for a christian suffering has meaning it has purpose god takes it and he uses it to cause us to grow in his life and character and in his ex in our experience with him and the love of god he's not coming for a bunch of milk toast christians he's he's coming for tested and tried and faithful people that have been through the fire and back and they prevailed overcoming it means there's struggles there's trials there's there's pain brother branham says this in the sermon i know and why does god let troubles come god harnesses trouble puts bits in its mouth and makes it obey him and those troubles bring us into a closer fellowship with god and that beautiful he he makes those troubles bow in obedience to him psalm 119 verse 75 says i know lord that thy judgments are right that thou in faithfulness has afflicted me my psalm 119 verse 71 it is good for me that i have been afflicted that i might learn thy statutes this is not this is not a weakling kind of walk that we're talking about here this is a rugged christian walk that abides why why can we abide these troubles in these trials because we have a faithful god amen psalms 89 31-34 if they break my statutes and keep not com my commandments then will i visit their transgression with the rod and their iniquity with stripes nevertheless my loving kindness will i not utterly take from him nor suffer my faithfulness to fail my covenant will i not break nor alter the thing that has gone out of my lips god allows troubles sometimes to correct us it's not always that way it's not always that way sometimes trouble is is just you're walking with god and satan's against you but other times god says i'm going to allow these difficulties to come in your life to bring you closer to me to correct you to teach you and that correction is what my loving kindness amen job 5 19 he shall deliver thee in six troubles yea and seven there shall no evil touch thee now if we have the gospel the american gospel we read no evil touch penis we're going to have an easy life what does it mean no evil shall touch me means he's going to keep you from the evil one in other words you're not going to fall into his grips and come under his dominion you're going to stay under the faithfulness of god it doesn't mean that evil things won't happen to you it doesn't mean that you won't face great trials no not at all what it does mean is that god is going to keep you from going going to make it so that you will not be destroyed and brought to unbelief through them a.w pink writes apprehension of this truth will check our murmurings the lord knows what is best for each of us one effect of resting on this truth will be to silence our petulant complainings god is greatly honored when under trial and chastening we have good thoughts of him vindicate his wisdom and justice and recognize his love in his rebukes amen that's beautiful first peter 4 verse 19 says wherefore let him them that suffer according to the will of god commit the keeping of their souls to him in well-doing as unto a faithful creator amen he's a isn't isn't that amazing peter puts together suffering afflictions and a faithful creator it's not con it's not a contradiction to demonic way of thinking fleshly way of thinking suffering is in contradistinction to a faithful god but according to the scriptural way of thinking is suffering we can commit ourselves now to a faithful god amen all right let's go to the next one the love of god and we're just going to black that out for a second so we talked before about the nature of god god is spirit god is love god is light so the love of god is one of the just the primary attributes of god that many that his faithfulness and his goodness and his mercy all these things flow together unfortunately in today's day and age god's love is looked upon as some kind of form of agreeable weakness right he wants us to be good but since we're not good he just resigns himself and says well i'll take pity on them god loves us all is a phrase that you'll hear spoken and you may have said it yourself and i'm sure i've said it too unfortunately it's often turned into that all he does and all he is and it means that god wants us to have a good self-esteem no matter what and he just agrees with everything we do and lets us continue on to live however we want because i mean he loves us it's very extremely to the extreme unscriptural this is the reason that we see so little love for god amongst people that profess to be christians because they have a sappy god that lets them do anything they want they have no fire in their heart to live and love this god his commandments mean very little what is the greatest commandment love the lord your god with all your heart with all your soul with all your mind and with all your strength that's the greatest commandment and why would you see so little love for god because they don't know god in truth that's the problem because of this false doctrine of the love of god that we have pervasive in the world the airways are full of it every nation is filled with the false doctrine of the charismatic movement when we when we go to the middle east and deal with new believers we treat them as though they've never heard the gospel before even though they've watched benny hinn and joyce meyer for years why because they've never heard the gospel what they've heard is false doctrine about a loving god that wants them to be happy and rich it's playing to the emotions of people those men those women are not servants of god they're servants of the enemy and you when you do missions work you'll know that you start from scratch with those people that it came to christ on benny hyun or joyce meyer they're they're as dead as that doorknob in the back why are they why why are they dead because they've never they've never really met god they've met another concept about who god is and they use this book to get their theology but it's a perverted gospel and so why is there so little love for god why is there so little fire for god and i'm i'm sad to say it but is it true in our message churches today is there so little true passion and fire for god because do we really know him or we're just following a tradition tradition of our family and we know this is a better way to live so hey let's just just live this way and we feed our feed our minds on the bible and the world and all that and we're a little bit good and a little bit bad that's not the christian walk a christian walk is on fire for god yes of course ups and downs always ups and downs but the reality is that there is something inside of you that's pushing you that's revealing and correcting and teaching and dealing with you and doesn't allow you to live your own life that's the new birth it's a totally new creation it's not something from this world and it's not something that you're in control of you come to the place where you realize you're out of control and the more you grow the less control you want you would just want him and that's it but what does it come from knowing him knowing him in truth and it's such a fine line we talked about it before you can know about the love of god and you can have the perfect theology of the love of god and have it in balance with his sovereignty and his holiness but what about knowing that god personally coming into that relationship where he truly has his hand on you hey i mean if if we wanted to if we wanted to just throw out a bunch of platitudes and fill you up on the supernatural and love of god and all these things that the pews would be full pews would be full why aren't the pews full we're trying we're doing everything we can to preach the truth and the world doesn't want it but we want the love true love of god in our hearts we want to know him in the reality all the reality of who he is god has no grandchildren you have to be born again you personally not just under the influence of christianity of the message of your parents of your godly parents not just under that influence that's great you know we all want our children to be under the right influence but that's not the new birth it's just a dead person trying to pretend that they're alive it's a weekend at bernie's dragging around a dead body but they're not alive in christ get alive in christ how do you get alive in christ this is life eternal that they might know thee the only true god in jesus christ whom now has sent brother branham said you can never pray too much for revelation how are you going to know god how are you going to know truly know his love for you personally not just the doctrine of it for you personally a revelation to you personally i can't give it i can preach about it i can preach it but only god can give it amen we don't want to produce a bunch of lukewarm christians who show none of the character of christ in their own lives we want to live and walk in the truth of god's love all right deuteronomy 7 7-8 the lord did not set his love upon you this is i call this the humility verse the lord did not set his love upon you nor choose you because you are more in number than any people for you were the fewest of all people but because the lord loved you and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers hath the lord brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you out of the house of bondmen from the hand of pharaoh king of egypt god just gave us a circular argument the lord loved you because the lord loved you what does that mean in other words he sovereignly chose to love you for nothing that was good inside of you or about you there was nothing that merited his love what you merited was his wrath but because of the mystery of his sovereign eternal will he chose you called you justified you and glorified you amen ii timothy 1 verse 9 says who has saved us and called us with a holy calling not according to our works but according to his own purpose and grace which was given us in christ jesus before the world began so it was according to his own purpose and grace nothing to do with us nothing to do with our our works it was just all hymn first john 4 19 we love him because he first loved us he set his love upon us before the foundation of the world for all of eternity he loved you why because he loved you you didn't earn it you didn't merit it you didn't do anything to deserve it you didn't choose him and then therefore he chose you in fact we did everything we could possibly do to earn his anger he love you because he cho he loves you because he chose to love you god's love is eternal god is eternal therefore his love is eternal ephesians 1 4 and 5 says according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to good pleasure of his will so we were chosen before the world ever began and that in order that we would be holy and without blame what did he do this in in love all of his purpose in us and for us is because of his love jeremiah 31 verse 3 says the lord hath appeared of old unto me saying yea i have loved thee with an everlasting love therefore with loving kindness have i drawn thee amen god's love is sovereign romans 9 13 as it is written jacob have i loved but esau have i hated god chooses whom he loves merely based on his own sovereign will as we saw last week when talking about his foreknowledge it says that that the purpose of god according to election might stand jacob have i loved isaac i hated not that the purpose of god according to free will might stand but according to election god is sovereign god is love therefore it's sovereign love god's love is infinite ephesians 3 18 and 19 that we may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height and to know the love of christ which passes knowledge that you might be filled with all the fullness of god isn't that an incredible statement he wants us to know something that is beyond unders beyond knowing how do i know something that's beyond knowing you experience it by revelation by a relationship to know the love of christ which is beyond knowledge amen to do what when we know that love that has no end no beginning you can't get to the breadth you can't get to the length you can't get to the depth you can't get to the height when we know that personally what is it that you would be filled with the full all the fullness of god you want to be filled with all the fullness of god pray for a revelation of his love for you god's love is immutable james 1 17 every good gift and every perfect gift is from above and cometh down from the father of lights with with whom is no variableness neither shadow of turning so god his love god god himself doesn't vary he doesn't have a shadow of turning you know we we we talk about a shadow light casts a shadow and that changes right throughout the day because the sun is moving and that shadow changes but with god there's no change there's no variance there's no he's this way one time and he's this way another time he's always the same and therefore we can bring that back to to this is that his love is unchanging there's no variableness or shadow of turning in his love no matter what you do he's still going to love you why because you're his child that will never change romans 8 35 through 39 who shall separate us from the love of christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or fabin or nakedness or peril or sword now don't just run over those words it really sounds sometimes it sounds so highfalutin because it's it's king james but let's really look at it shall tribulation or distress persecution famine what is famine you don't have enough food to eat right nakedness it's not running around naked it's you don't have appropriate clothing in other words it's cold outside and you don't have a coat you don't have a blanket you don't have you don't have what is needed to keep you safe and and dry peril in other words dangers that you would face from from people attacking you or sword sword is was a means of execution cutting people's heads off to kill them so none of that can separate us from the love of christ what does that mean regardless of circumstances that you face in your life no matter how extreme they are they don't separate you from the love of christ as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for i am persuaded sueded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord amen nothing will separate you that's not just a song lyric that's not just that's not just a scripture in a in some old dusty book that is god's heart for you personally nothing can separate you from his love that's that's the level of his immutable unchanging unalterable love god's love is holy hebrews 12 6 says for whom the lord loveth he chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom he receives he is holy and he tells us to be holy so through his love he corrects us to make us more holy more like him god's love is gracious ephesians 2 4 and 5 but god who is rich in mercy for his great great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins has quickened us together with christ by grace we are saved musicians if you'd come god's love extends grace to us we know that song the love of god is greater far than tongue or pen can ever tell it goes beyond the highest star and reaches to the lowest hell the guilty pair bowed down with care god gave his son to win his airing child he reconciled and parted from his sin o love of god how rich and pure how measureless and strong it shall forevermore endure the saints and angels song god is love that's that's what that's what it's not just that god has love we talked about that before that's what he is so whatever he does is love when when he judges the wicked sends them to the lake of fire say that's his wrath yes but it's his love to us because there's going to be a earth where god is all in all and we're dwelling on it so he he wipes out sin he wipes out evil and what is that we think it's it's god's wrath right to them it's god's wrath to us it's god's love you know and and i think it's easy to bring the doctrine god loves you [Music] and to bring try to bring it as best we can in the balance of the scripture god is god's love is holy god's love is immutable god's love is sovereign god's love is eternal god's love is uninfluenced we want to bring it in the balance of the scriptures and yet it needs to be go from the pages to the heart to really know it not know facts i've given you facts now you've got to pray for revelation that the word would really be written on your heart not just something that oh oh that was a good message and we go on our way but really to study and and and and pray over it and ask god to re quicken and reveal these things to you we're not just getting up to give a nice sermon we want we really want to give you something to feed on to study that your soul would be filled that you would be encouraged that you would be strengthened that you'd be corrected all of these things otherwise our getting together is really completely in vain there's a lot of better preachers you could be streaming online than me hundreds thousands but
