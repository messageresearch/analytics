[44:26] [Music]
[44:39] [Music]
[44:47] every praise the Lord
[44:50] the Lord Jesus
[44:52] a lot of wonderful consolation that is
[44:56] turned to Ephesians chapter six if you
[44:58] would verse 11.
[45:02] and greet you tonight again the name of
[45:03] the Lord what a privilege it is for us
[45:06] to be gathered here in this this place
[45:08] in his presence
[45:12] Ephesians chapter 6 verse 11 will read
[45:14] down through verses
[45:16] 13.
[45:18] put on the whole armor of God that you
[45:20] may be able to stand against The Wiles
[45:23] of the devil
[45:25] for we wrestle not against flesh and
[45:28] blood
[45:29] but against principalities and Powers
[45:33] against the rulers of the darkness of
[45:37] this world
[45:38] against spiritual
[45:40] wickedness in high places and the word
[45:44] high actually is Heavenly
[45:47] spiritual wickedness in
[45:50] Heavenly places
[45:52] wherefore taken unto you the whole armor
[45:54] of God
[45:55] that you may be able to withstanding the
[46:00] evil day
[46:01] you see those who just come to the Lord
[46:03] Jesus and they never go any farther than
[46:06] the cross
[46:07] I feel sorry for them
[46:09] brother Jason preached it at our church
[46:11] several years ago about the cross and
[46:14] what a great opening that the cross was
[46:16] to Eternity but the cross was not the
[46:19] end of it
[46:20] the cross was actually the beginning
[46:23] that's right I'm glad the message of the
[46:26] hour has helped us to see that
[46:28] wherefore take unto you the whole armor
[46:30] of God that you may be able to withstand
[46:32] in the evil day in the evil day I want
[46:37] you to notice the way Paul writes it as
[46:38] if though that it wasn't even in his
[46:41] time yet
[46:42] but there was coming a time when it was
[46:45] going to be so evil and having done all
[46:48] to stand let's pray together
[46:52] truly heavenly father that is our desire
[46:55] we know lord it's not just what we've
[46:58] done 10 years ago it's not how faithful
[47:01] we were 20 years ago but we want to be
[47:05] faithful to the very end Lord God
[47:08] for we know many of those which were
[47:10] brought out of the land of Egypt the
[47:12] Bible tells us you later destroyed them
[47:16] so we know father that Redemption has
[47:19] two parts
[47:20] coming out of and going into
[47:23] many people as the prophet tells us and
[47:26] how can overcome they left the world
[47:28] they left many things of the world and
[47:31] he said so did Lot's wife
[47:33] I've always thought it a Marvel in
[47:36] Reading Luke 17 that after you spoke
[47:39] about the coming of the son of man and
[47:42] the great sign that would be revealed in
[47:44] the last day
[47:45] then you say these words remember
[47:49] Lot's wife
[47:52] so after the son of man is going to be
[47:54] revealed then that's when we're supposed
[47:57] to remember Lot's wife
[48:00] I find it amazing Lord you never told us
[48:02] to remember Sarah you never told us to
[48:05] remember Rebecca Rachel Rahab many of
[48:10] the Great women of the Bible but you
[48:12] told us to remember
[48:14] Lot's wife
[48:15] so it shows that there will be people
[48:17] that will come out under the revealing
[48:19] of the son of man and they will turn
[48:22] back but we believe there's a people
[48:24] here tonight
[48:25] they're not going back
[48:27] they're going on we remember her and we
[48:30] remember we don't want nothing to do
[48:32] with her we don't want nothing to do
[48:34] with solder we know there's a great
[48:36] difference between a pillar of salt and
[48:39] a pillar of fire and that's what we're
[48:42] following tonight speak to us from your
[48:44] word father we pray in the name of the
[48:46] Lord Jesus and the Saints said
[48:49] amen God bless you you may be
[48:56] Paul encourages them to
[49:01] fight like real soldiers of God
[49:05] put on the whole armor of God that they
[49:08] might be able to withstand The Wiles of
[49:12] the devil
[49:13] the word Wiles actually means let me
[49:16] read this to you that which is traced
[49:19] out
[49:21] with method that which is traced out
[49:25] with message that which is well laid
[49:30] so it is a strategy it is something that
[49:35] is well sought
[49:37] something that is planned very well it
[49:40] pertains to Art and skill coming cunning
[49:45] devices
[49:47] attempts to delude or destroy so the
[49:52] thing Paul wanted the Believers in this
[49:55] age to be able to comprehend as well as
[49:58] for us today of course was that Satan is
[50:01] not necessarily going to have an open
[50:05] Warfare
[50:06] think of it most of us have never even
[50:09] seen the devil any y'all ever seen a
[50:11] demon
[50:12] you ever seen one well I have I hope you
[50:15] never have to
[50:18] I don't mind telling you
[50:20] but that's not normally the way Satan
[50:22] fights
[50:24] Satan fights covertly he fights in
[50:28] ambush
[50:29] he fights in the form of snares and
[50:33] traps
[50:35] he's too afraid actually to meet you
[50:39] face to face
[50:40] Satan was the original and true
[50:45] terrorist
[50:47] now we've been hearing a lot about
[50:48] Terror
[50:49] [Music]
[50:50] we heard a lot about that too didn't we
[50:53] that Devil Boy
[50:56] he's going to get his Hive burn again
[50:58] tonight
[50:59] [Applause]
[51:03] so Satan doesn't really carry out open
[51:05] Warfare and just come right up against
[51:08] you and get his weapons and hit you and
[51:11] stomp you and oh no no he's much more
[51:14] cunning than that
[51:16] as I said he's the original terrorist so
[51:18] he likes to lay his booby traps and his
[51:21] snares and all those sort of things to
[51:24] be able to meet the Christian Soldier so
[51:27] he advances covertly he comes in
[51:30] sneaking now you don't have to raise
[51:32] your hand to this but I wonder how many
[51:34] of us tonight would be honest and say
[51:36] some of the biggest mistakes you ever
[51:38] made as a Christian was a snare that was
[51:40] laid before you and you had no plan on
[51:44] becoming involved in this or that or the
[51:46] other whatever it was and yet it was
[51:48] just like it appeared and you walked
[51:50] right into it the next thing you know
[51:52] you're found in the middle of something
[51:53] and you say how in the world did I get
[51:56] in this type of a place well this is his
[52:00] specialty and this is the type of
[52:02] warfare that he carries out against the
[52:05] child of God but yet the Bible tells us
[52:07] that we are not ignorant concerning
[52:10] Satan's devices or his ways now as I
[52:14] mentioned to you last night that God has
[52:17] an intelligence and we know in Warfare
[52:19] that intelligence is a very important
[52:22] thing and according to what I've been
[52:24] able to read down through the years
[52:26] Israel has some of the best intelligence
[52:29] in the world as a matter of fact America
[52:31] and Israel they share to intelligence
[52:34] and Israel has you know the shenbet and
[52:37] they have the different ones it was
[52:39] there a couple of years ago with on a
[52:41] tour with brother Mike walls and our
[52:43] guide actually worked with the Mossad
[52:46] any of you that know the massage you
[52:48] know that the Messiah is part of the
[52:49] Secret Service so one day on our tour we
[52:52] got a couple hour delay well we didn't
[52:54] know exactly what it was but we just
[52:56] waited till he got back whenever he got
[52:58] back he kind of included Us in that they
[53:00] had actually sneaked into Iran and took
[53:03] in some secret documents right out from
[53:05] under their noses and he had to have an
[53:07] update because he's one of them upper
[53:09] guys in the Mossad so their intelligence
[53:12] is very very good but yet when it would
[53:14] come to this type of a battle it's easy
[53:16] to see Israel don't have a clue what's
[53:18] going on right now spiritually but yet
[53:21] God I believe God has some agents that
[53:26] are trained with Divine intelligence now
[53:30] I'm going to share something with you
[53:31] tonight that I've never told any other
[53:34] group of people I am a an agent for the
[53:38] CIA
[53:40] I am also an agent for the FBI the CIA
[53:45] that I work for is Christ intelligence
[53:49] agency
[53:50] the FBI that I'll work for is the
[53:54] firstborn intelligence agency
[53:58] well your pastor works for the same
[54:00] awesome
[54:01] some of these other brothers you do as
[54:03] well
[54:03] now you know what God wants to do is
[54:06] actually give us a little bit of his
[54:09] Divine intelligence that will help us to
[54:13] be a better Warrior a better soldier in
[54:16] the battle that we're in isn't that what
[54:18] we want if you don't believe that listen
[54:20] to Satan's heat in 1965 and brother
[54:22] Branham writing the introduction of that
[54:24] sermon brother Brandon will tell you
[54:25] said he thought about he'd hurt by the
[54:27] devil preaching he thought about what he
[54:29] would bring that night in such a
[54:30] blessing her mother never he said and he
[54:32] said he wanted to bring something to be
[54:34] a blessing to the people so he thought
[54:35] what could I bring that would help you
[54:37] to be a better Soldier and he said bring
[54:40] something to you that would help you to
[54:42] keep the punches off of you as much as
[54:45] possible wow wouldn't that be good to be
[54:47] able to keep the punch assault what is
[54:49] that that is God enlightening us with a
[54:52] little bit of divine intelligence to be
[54:55] able to help us to be a better Soldier
[54:57] whether we're men women boys or girls
[54:59] and what we are in and the Lord wants us
[55:02] to be able to continue and now we know
[55:04] that he's not going to eliminate all of
[55:07] our battles all of our trials all of our
[55:09] tests but what he does want us to do is
[55:12] to equip Us in such a way that we can be
[55:15] able to shed off as many of Satan's
[55:17] darts as possible as a pastor I believe
[55:20] in Repentance I believe in the mercy of
[55:22] God the grace of God I'm grateful that
[55:25] God is there to forgive us when we do
[55:27] wrong but I believe that we can live in
[55:30] such a way the Holy Ghost will not only
[55:33] help us and forgive us when we're wrong
[55:35] he will help us bypass and go around
[55:38] many of the pitfalls that Satan lays
[55:42] before us I don't want to just be a
[55:44] Christian that is all the time repenting
[55:46] and repenting and repenting and
[55:48] repenting I want to be the type of
[55:50] Christian that absolutely goes around
[55:52] something that the devil does instead of
[55:54] repenting I'm praising and citizen I'm
[55:57] so sorry I'm so sorry I'm so sorry I'm
[56:00] so sorry sure I've had to say I'm sorry
[56:03] a lot but I want to go on and become a
[56:06] better Christian where I don't spend so
[56:08] much of my time saying I'm sorry but I'm
[56:12] grateful I'm grateful I'm grateful you
[56:15] led me right around that you showed me
[56:17] and I went right isn't that what we want
[56:19] tonight
[56:21] now it's wonderful to know God in the
[56:23] way of repentance but I really believe
[56:25] God wants us to know him also in a way
[56:28] of divine intelligence that he helps us
[56:31] by his own spirit and he leads us in
[56:34] such a way and it totally dumbfounds the
[56:37] devil and Satan will may lay a trap for
[56:40] you for weeks or months at a time and
[56:43] the spirit of God the very day the devil
[56:46] is ready to spring that trap on you the
[56:48] spirit of God leads you right around
[56:50] that thing and them Devils go back down
[56:52] in hell I mean they're crying they're
[56:54] all tore up they don't know what in the
[56:56] world to do they put forth all this
[56:58] effort and they've done all of this
[57:00] stuff and you know what you're supposed
[57:02] to go down that way because methodically
[57:04] they timed you they watched you you
[57:07] repeat this over and over again but that
[57:10] day the spirit of God LED you another
[57:11] way and the devil was our waiting and
[57:14] you didn't show up
[57:16] Hallelujah well you see I believe that's
[57:19] what the message of the hour does I I
[57:21] don't think that the message of the hour
[57:22] just gives us a bunch of quotes I don't
[57:26] think the message this makes us smarter
[57:28] than the average denominational person I
[57:31] think it makes us more like the Lord
[57:33] Jesus I don't believe the Lord Jesus
[57:36] spent all of his life I'm sorry Father
[57:37] I'm sorry Father I'm sorry Father as a
[57:40] matter of fact I don't find no place he
[57:42] ever said that now I don't expect to be
[57:45] like him no I know I'm a human but I do
[57:47] sing the closer I get to him the more he
[57:50] will reveal to me Satan's tactics and
[57:53] I'm better able to understand the enemy
[57:55] that I'm dealing with and the church
[57:57] said now you see what Satan will do then
[58:01] is try to bring us into a spot to where
[58:04] that we fall into it over and over again
[58:07] now I said is every one of us our makeup
[58:09] he knows the sign hope he don't think
[58:10] I'm crazy now tonight but Satan knows
[58:13] the star you're born at her now
[58:15] absolutely when you you were born the
[58:17] stars were placed in heaven in a certain
[58:19] place and the prophet said well you said
[58:21] that's crazy no it's not God's Prophet
[58:23] said in 1964 you were born under a
[58:26] certain sign a certain star and he said
[58:28] that has something to do with you that
[58:31] sets what he called once your births
[58:34] pass now a person come to him asking him
[58:37] about the Holy Ghost now brother Adam
[58:38] said what I'd done was I went and seen
[58:41] the sign that person was born under and
[58:43] I've seen the birth path and that put
[58:45] them under a cross which put them under
[58:48] a four now don't ask me what that means
[58:51] because I don't have a clue
[58:53] but if I know he did so but I know that
[58:57] those things do affect us so Satan will
[59:00] watch us now you can you know it
[59:02] yourself that you go through certain
[59:03] cycles and there's certain strains that
[59:06] come in certain families and it's like
[59:08] that some people don't reach the that
[59:10] that effect of a certain strain in their
[59:13] family until they hit their 20s or their
[59:15] 30s or their 40s and you'll watch them
[59:17] they'll be doing good forever so long
[59:19] then all of a sudden they reach in that
[59:21] certain spot and it's like something
[59:23] just grabs a hold of them and they
[59:26] change and you say what in the world
[59:27] happened to them and it's a natural
[59:29] strength don't look at me so funny I'm
[59:31] just quoting what he said he said
[59:33] they're strange that runs in families oh
[59:36] you say but we got the Holy Ghost but
[59:37] your old stinking flesh ain't got it and
[59:40] my old stinking flesh ain't got it
[59:42] neither and that's why the Holy Ghost
[59:44] and the Soul wants to bring our flesh in
[59:47] subjection to the spirit of God is that
[59:50] right now you see Satan knows all this
[59:53] about humanity and remember he's been
[59:56] fighting these human battles for six
[59:58] thousand years I'm only 66 years old how
[1:00:01] in the world would I ever be able to
[1:00:03] meet an enemy which has been fighting
[1:00:06] and defeating Humanity for six
[1:00:09] Millennials long how could you as a
[1:00:12] Young Man a young woman ever meet such a
[1:00:15] foe like this this is the one who calls
[1:00:18] Moses to lose his temper and be kept out
[1:00:21] of the promised land this is the one
[1:00:24] that actually betrayed or deceived I
[1:00:26] should say Joshua for a little bit
[1:00:28] concerning the men of gibea whenever
[1:00:31] they showed up in Old garments and and
[1:00:33] they looked like they was from a foreign
[1:00:35] country and there was actually just
[1:00:36] right over the hill and yet Joshua the
[1:00:39] mighty General the devil was able to
[1:00:41] deceive that man and make a covenant
[1:00:44] with them should I go on this is the
[1:00:46] same one that deceives Samson this is
[1:00:49] the same one that Jeremiah whenever he
[1:00:51] said I'll speak no more in the name
[1:00:53] about the Lord so who are we to be able
[1:00:57] to meet such an enemy I'll tell you who
[1:00:59] we are we are a New Testament Holy Ghost
[1:01:02] Field children of God that on our own we
[1:01:06] are absolute complete failures but with
[1:01:08] him inside of us we are more than all
[1:01:12] the demons out of hell all of them
[1:01:14] joined together they better take note
[1:01:17] because there is an army of the Living
[1:01:20] God that are not survivors but they are
[1:01:23] more than conquerors
[1:01:26] now you see the Christian Warfare is
[1:01:30] against this struggle of strategies and
[1:01:33] Wilds now let us go back again a little
[1:01:35] bit if you don't mind and look at our
[1:01:37] enemy and get a little bit clearer view
[1:01:39] of who he is the prophet says it this
[1:01:42] way did you know in heaven that the
[1:01:44] devil was God's right hand man in the
[1:01:47] beginning Lucifer the son of the morning
[1:01:49] was given power and the reason that he
[1:01:52] brought sin into the world he was able
[1:01:54] to take something that God had created
[1:01:57] and perverted back into an evil thing
[1:02:02] now remember Satan is not a Creator he
[1:02:06] was everything that God was except for
[1:02:10] that so he cannot create his own Angels
[1:02:13] he cannot create his own church he
[1:02:16] cannot create all of these things so he
[1:02:19] must take what God has done and
[1:02:22] perverted to his own purpose again he
[1:02:25] says oh my notices what started all this
[1:02:28] trouble in the beginning God back before
[1:02:30] the foundation of the world was ever
[1:02:32] late seen what Satan done in his pride
[1:02:35] he went over in the north and set up a
[1:02:39] kingdom I don't know if you've ever
[1:02:40] looked at or not but it's amazing when
[1:02:41] you study directionally about the North
[1:02:44] and what the north is it was the north
[1:02:46] side of the Tabernacle whenever they
[1:02:48] built the Tabernacle and they wrapped it
[1:02:50] and they would have overlapping part of
[1:02:52] those skins it was on the North side
[1:02:54] that the overlapping was laid now that
[1:02:57] word is also used as a flank or the
[1:03:00] extremity or it was as the displaying
[1:03:03] the female part and it was that part by
[1:03:06] which the presence of God would enter
[1:03:08] into the holiest of holies so they would
[1:03:10] wrap that around and this was what Satan
[1:03:12] won I want God's church I want God's
[1:03:16] Property you know as well as I do any
[1:03:18] view that God has ever shown you his
[1:03:20] Divine favor and Satan has been watching
[1:03:23] you since you were a child he does not
[1:03:25] have a microscope or a pair of
[1:03:27] binoculars where you can look down in
[1:03:29] your soul and see if there's a seed or
[1:03:31] not but what he watches is God's love
[1:03:34] God's protection God's mercy and God's
[1:03:38] divine grace towards certain individuals
[1:03:40] he's watched that for Millennial now and
[1:03:43] he's able to tell by that that God has
[1:03:46] something special for that one that one
[1:03:48] that one or that one are you hearing me
[1:03:50] but not because of our flesh not because
[1:03:53] of our natural birth but he watches what
[1:03:56] the spirit of God does for you maybe God
[1:03:59] spares you when you as a child you
[1:04:01] should have died it was in an accident
[1:04:02] you should have been killed but you
[1:04:04] didn't something miraculously spared
[1:04:07] your life that's a great great thing is
[1:04:10] it not but it was also a footnote made
[1:04:12] down at Hell watch her watch him watch
[1:04:17] this watch that now before you might
[1:04:19] just been a normal baby a normal child
[1:04:21] but Supernatural is something by Divine
[1:04:24] sovereignty stepped in and kept you on
[1:04:27] All Odds were against you then Satan
[1:04:30] must learn how to watch those people
[1:04:33] because he's seen them how that God did
[1:04:35] it with David God did it with Daniel God
[1:04:37] did it with Jeremiah over and over again
[1:04:40] now watch the prophet says that in this
[1:04:44] Pride he went over in the north and set
[1:04:47] up a kingdom now watch what he done so
[1:04:50] while he's still in heaven remember he
[1:04:52] hasn't been kicked out yet and brother
[1:04:54] Jason was talking about it today and he
[1:04:56] was talking about how that Satan must
[1:04:58] have started preaching there to the
[1:05:00] angels and more than likely didn't just
[1:05:02] start out and I'll tell you God's the
[1:05:04] mean God and God's about God and God's
[1:05:05] this and that and the other but maybe
[1:05:07] you know we don't even know how long
[1:05:09] that this took it might have been one
[1:05:11] meeting as it were after another now
[1:05:14] these angels started coming and hearing
[1:05:16] the devil preach he might not have got
[1:05:18] up and said I'll tell you one thing I'm
[1:05:19] leading a Revolt tonight where the word
[1:05:22] go absolutely tired of standing against
[1:05:24] God we want to do it it might have been
[1:05:26] one one little saying I threw another
[1:05:28] little saying I to another little saying
[1:05:31] now notice the prophet said that he set
[1:05:33] up this Kingdom and he fought against
[1:05:36] Michael and his angels notice next
[1:05:39] paragraph the right hand man
[1:05:43] of almighty God
[1:05:46] was Lucifer
[1:05:51] the son of the morning
[1:05:53] the first God granted him almost
[1:05:55] co-workers
[1:05:58] with him
[1:05:59] he was a co-worker partly equal
[1:06:04] with him only Satan could not create God
[1:06:09] is the only Creator but Satan took
[1:06:11] something that God created and heard it
[1:06:14] perverted it back so he was a co-worker
[1:06:18] with God God's right-hand man if God
[1:06:21] wanted to talk was any of the Angelic
[1:06:25] beings he fellowshipped was Lucifer
[1:06:30] oh my goodness
[1:06:33] notice again question answer Satan was
[1:06:36] the original Archangel of God he once
[1:06:40] dwelt in heaven now listen
[1:06:42] he once was the greatest person in the
[1:06:47] heavens outside of God
[1:06:53] so here's God and here's Lucifer
[1:06:58] the next greatest person in heaven he
[1:07:02] was God's right hand man to Fellowship
[1:07:05] my goodness and he got puffed up in his
[1:07:09] heart now notice again in in this same
[1:07:12] one paragraph 73 so Lucifer is on the
[1:07:15] Earth today trying to work in the church
[1:07:19] to accomplish the same purpose that he
[1:07:23] started before the foundation of the
[1:07:25] world now remember the Angels fell
[1:07:28] before the foundation of the world was
[1:07:31] ever laid
[1:07:34] the Earth wasn't even formed yet
[1:07:38] oh no
[1:07:40] Lucifer in heaven tried to exalt himself
[1:07:45] and even be just a little higher
[1:07:51] than his boss
[1:07:54] you see this is why God hates Rebellion
[1:07:59] this is why God hates Rebellion when
[1:08:03] people rebel against God's divine order
[1:08:06] or God's Divine protocol
[1:08:09] God hates it why here he is the
[1:08:12] originator of it so whatever children
[1:08:15] rebel against their parents they don't
[1:08:18] understand and we're living in the age
[1:08:20] to wear Rebellion is what is absolutely
[1:08:23] pushed and flaunted in this day our
[1:08:26] government wanting to allow our children
[1:08:28] to have these operations on them that
[1:08:31] will change them from boys and girls and
[1:08:33] this and that even without the parents
[1:08:36] consent you've got to be kidding me I I
[1:08:39] thought this was America not red China I
[1:08:42] thought this was America not communism
[1:08:45] or Russia or something like that and yet
[1:08:47] look what they want to do what is it it
[1:08:49] is the Defiance of divine order and
[1:08:53] Satan tries to do the same thing right
[1:08:55] inside the message of the hour to where
[1:08:58] God Has Come men that are called of God
[1:09:00] and what does the devil do try to come
[1:09:02] right back around and say oh we don't
[1:09:04] need preachers no more we can just stay
[1:09:07] home we don't have to listen to No oh
[1:09:09] sorry sure tell us what to do you know
[1:09:11] where that comes from it comes right
[1:09:13] from the pits of hell it is not the
[1:09:16] anointing of the Holy Ghost mother
[1:09:17] random never told any such thing it is
[1:09:20] Antichrist in principle
[1:09:23] well I guess I might have to preaching
[1:09:25] amen myself too
[1:09:28] now notice so he wanted to be a little
[1:09:30] bit higher than his boss and he betrayed
[1:09:34] Michael
[1:09:37] so Satan then moves out of this position
[1:09:41] being second was not enough
[1:09:44] he had to be first or nothing
[1:09:48] so when he moves from his position he
[1:09:52] betrayed Michael
[1:09:54] when Eve moved from her position to
[1:09:58] becoming the head of the home
[1:10:00] she betrayed her husband
[1:10:02] when the serpent moved from his position
[1:10:05] now if you watch when God brought the
[1:10:08] creation on the earth the serpent
[1:10:10] mirrored what Lucifer mirrored in heaven
[1:10:14] so here was Lucifer being God's
[1:10:16] right-hand man to fellowship and the
[1:10:19] serpent was Adam's right hand man of
[1:10:22] Fellowship in the Garden of Eden so he
[1:10:25] didn't go to the lowest part of the
[1:10:27] creation but right next to God I hope
[1:10:29] you're going to listen to me tonight
[1:10:30] I'll tell your friends the anointed ones
[1:10:33] at the end time and our twin will not be
[1:10:37] a Baptist
[1:10:38] now come on every Revival has produced a
[1:10:41] set of twins you know what our twins
[1:10:43] going to do they're going to quote the
[1:10:45] prophet well here we go They're not
[1:10:47] going to stand up and quote Billy Graham
[1:10:49] you know some of these guys are Smiley
[1:10:52] preacher from down in Houston they're
[1:10:53] not going to stand up and quote this and
[1:10:55] that and the other of a denomination of
[1:10:57] a water what is our Trend going to look
[1:10:59] like they're going to look like a
[1:11:01] message preacher they're going to look
[1:11:03] like message people well I'm sorry but
[1:11:06] that's exactly what your twin is going
[1:11:09] to look like but it does not change the
[1:11:12] reality of God's word
[1:11:15] oh my now what's what Satan did was able
[1:11:20] to preach to these angels and whenever
[1:11:24] he did that then the Bible writes about
[1:11:27] them in the book of Jude and it says
[1:11:29] that they left their first estate
[1:11:33] now naturally when we think about a
[1:11:35] state we would think about a piece of
[1:11:37] property and all maybe whatever your
[1:11:39] idea of an estate would be down here I
[1:11:42] suppose sea grass about that tall
[1:11:44] tarpon's uh crocodiles or y'all got
[1:11:47] alligators that's right alligators
[1:11:49] um let me see Sand Gnats and uh you know
[1:11:52] a big old uh big white fence all around
[1:11:56] this beautiful beautiful Marsh and uh
[1:11:59] and that's your idea I'm going to stay
[1:12:00] well not me not me no I'm a Kentucky boy
[1:12:04] so my idea of an estate brother Jason
[1:12:07] might be something like that on the
[1:12:08] Versailles Road it should go out which
[1:12:10] is Route 60 out of Lexington and as you
[1:12:13] would leave from the Bluegrass airport
[1:12:15] there and you would keep going toward
[1:12:17] Versailles and you'll start seeing these
[1:12:19] white fences with all them thoroughbreds
[1:12:21] and you'd see all them beautiful Rolling
[1:12:24] Hills and then you go out about four
[1:12:25] miles out from a Pentecostal church I
[1:12:27] used to preach out there and you'll see
[1:12:29] this Castle sitting up on a hill this
[1:12:32] Castle was actually really a rich man
[1:12:34] I'm multi-millionaire which married a
[1:12:37] very young woman and this young woman's
[1:12:39] dream home was a castle so he built her
[1:12:42] a castle setting up on a hill it has a
[1:12:45] moat around him it has a bridge it has
[1:12:48] all kinds of things as you keep going
[1:12:50] you see this great big old beautiful
[1:12:52] barns well Secretariat come from and
[1:12:55] where all these fine racehorses and many
[1:12:57] of them barns they keep them in it's
[1:12:59] nauseous in the homes and you and I live
[1:13:01] in I know because I've had a
[1:13:02] brother-in-law that used to work there
[1:13:03] so in my idea you know that would be a
[1:13:06] mistake my great big rolling beautiful
[1:13:09] place but that was not what the Angels
[1:13:12] had but the Angels did have an estate
[1:13:15] something that God allocated to them in
[1:13:18] his great Mercy in order to give them a
[1:13:22] charge in his domain now remember the
[1:13:24] Primeval order uh that you and I know
[1:13:26] about in Genesis is very very vague and
[1:13:29] they know that it looks like there's two
[1:13:30] stages of the earth so maybe we'll get
[1:13:32] into it in the morning that in the
[1:13:34] beginning God created the heavens and
[1:13:36] the Earth and the Earth was without form
[1:13:38] and void and darkness covered the face
[1:13:40] of the deep and the spirit of God moved
[1:13:42] upon the waters and God said let there
[1:13:45] be light and there was light now we know
[1:13:47] that word the light is ore which means
[1:13:49] they come into existence and the prophet
[1:13:51] tells us in the seal book when that word
[1:13:53] is quoted let there be light that God
[1:13:55] does not actually creating the Sun the
[1:13:58] moon and the stars but they were already
[1:14:00] in existence but something had happened
[1:14:03] on the earth and through the earth into
[1:14:07] this Darkness so when we see the Earth
[1:14:09] appear there in Chapter 2 it is not in
[1:14:13] its original condition but something had
[1:14:16] happened on the earth what was it it's
[1:14:18] the same being right here he come down
[1:14:21] and walked on this earth when God was
[1:14:25] creating it when it was in its volcanic
[1:14:28] State now don't sit there and look at me
[1:14:30] funny because I got the quotes right in
[1:14:31] front of me I'll read them to you
[1:14:33] so there was a war that went on so God
[1:14:37] disposes of this enemy he loses this
[1:14:41] position as far as being the chair of
[1:14:43] them then the Angels come down with him
[1:14:46] they were kicked out of heaven the
[1:14:48] prophet mentions about this as far as a
[1:14:50] hurricane crossed the mystery he said
[1:14:52] speaking about the Devil he's building
[1:14:54] an intellectual Kingdom that will
[1:14:55] outshine Christ's little bitty flock a
[1:14:59] seat what did he did that with Fallen
[1:15:02] Angels the Bible said it was Fallen
[1:15:04] Angels who listened to Lucifer instead
[1:15:07] of Christ who they wants
[1:15:10] belonged to
[1:15:13] it ain't no wonder when people walk away
[1:15:15] from this word they become worse than
[1:15:17] they were before they ever got saved
[1:15:19] look at many of them all they may not in
[1:15:22] there so when the death the devil knows
[1:15:23] better than that but look at how they go
[1:15:25] to letting go of this and letting go of
[1:15:27] that look at their attitude first of all
[1:15:29] look at how they go to living look at
[1:15:31] how they go to crucifying everybody that
[1:15:33] don't believe what they've got to say
[1:15:34] well it's the truth is it notice again
[1:15:37] he says now listen Fallen Angels what
[1:15:39] kind of angels
[1:15:42] oh dear God
[1:15:44] looser
[1:15:46] Wesley
[1:15:48] Catholic
[1:15:50] Pentecostals who kept not the first
[1:15:53] estate
[1:15:57] do you understand one of the instruments
[1:16:00] that Satan is going to use and has used
[1:16:01] for decades in this message
[1:16:04] to cause such chaos
[1:16:07] fallen angels has crept in Among Us
[1:16:10] men Anointed with Fallen Angels spirits
[1:16:18] how does Lord Jesus
[1:16:22] who kept not their first estate like the
[1:16:24] Angels did has fell into organization
[1:16:27] like Lucifer's main hole at nicaea West
[1:16:30] it was a man of God but what followed
[1:16:33] him Fallen Angels got into it
[1:16:39] so it was a move of God at one time is
[1:16:41] that right A Move of God westernism was
[1:16:44] a genuine move of God in the earth and
[1:16:46] before they could proclamate that
[1:16:48] message Fallen Angels come in it and
[1:16:52] took preachers or lay it to you whoever
[1:16:54] more and they begin to use them under
[1:16:58] the name of wesleyism or methodism and
[1:17:02] it began to take an agenda who was it oh
[1:17:05] Lord children it was the same devil that
[1:17:08] preached his Gospel of Science and
[1:17:10] education to Eve in the Garden of Eden
[1:17:15] oh my what was the Angels versus had
[1:17:19] created beings of God but they fell for
[1:17:21] Lucifer's wisdom for Lucifer's wisdom
[1:17:24] and you see what they become fallen
[1:17:26] angels and organizations from Men of God
[1:17:30] Luther never started an organization
[1:17:32] once they never started one brother
[1:17:34] brother was certainly didn't serve what
[1:17:38] but we still got them around us
[1:17:41] and whether you like it or not you might
[1:17:43] also say Amen
[1:17:44] this message to itself will never make
[1:17:46] an organization no sir but the prophet
[1:17:49] never said the spirit of organization
[1:17:51] wouldn't come around us we've had them
[1:17:53] for years and years we've got all kinds
[1:17:55] of camps and all types of titles well
[1:17:57] what do you believe about the Thunders
[1:17:59] and what do you believe about how many
[1:18:00] Souls you got I could go on and on
[1:18:02] you've heard him you've been around some
[1:18:03] of you longer than I have and it's the
[1:18:06] same Spirit of organization to try to
[1:18:08] divide us to try to separate us where we
[1:18:11] won't even fellowship with one another
[1:18:13] won't even shake hands hardly with one
[1:18:15] another what is it Fallen Angels Fallen
[1:18:19] Angels men that got under the influence
[1:18:21] of demons out of hell and they begin to
[1:18:25] say and well the prophet said the
[1:18:26] prophet said the prophet said
[1:18:31] oh goodness
[1:18:34] notice this there's only one way
[1:18:36] provided by God he says Lucifer at the
[1:18:39] beginning wanted to build himself a
[1:18:41] kingdom which is greater and more
[1:18:43] beautiful than Michael's Kingdom Christ
[1:18:47] that was his ambition to achieve
[1:18:50] something like that and what did he get
[1:18:52] to do it by he took Fallen Angels who
[1:18:56] had lost their first estate
[1:18:59] he took that to do it with he's doing it
[1:19:03] with Fallen Angels following lucerne's
[1:19:07] falling Methodist
[1:19:09] Fallen Pentecostals
[1:19:12] oh you like it much better I guess if I
[1:19:14] stop there huh well let me update it and
[1:19:17] bring it on up to you fallen message
[1:19:19] preachers
[1:19:21] message preachers that stood in the
[1:19:23] pulpit and declare this message was a
[1:19:25] truth for years and years and what are
[1:19:27] some of them tonight blasting the same
[1:19:30] prophet of God they stood for blasting
[1:19:33] the same message they say they believe
[1:19:35] God have mercy on us
[1:19:38] may God help us that we don't turn our
[1:19:41] backs on this truth
[1:19:43] [Applause]
[1:19:49] notice as he goes on to say Lucifer is
[1:19:51] achieving today
[1:19:53] by man
[1:19:55] with those spirits
[1:19:58] in them
[1:20:03] Lord God
[1:20:05] we're going to be under the influence of
[1:20:07] one of two kings
[1:20:10] there's only really two powers in the
[1:20:12] Earth today two kings both of them
[1:20:15] wanting dominance
[1:20:17] King Jesus and King devil
[1:20:22] Lord God keep me Lord Jesus
[1:20:25] notice this God of this evil age
[1:20:28] it was Satan's ambition to be worshiped
[1:20:31] like God
[1:20:33] he took two thirds two-thirds of the
[1:20:35] stars of Heaven
[1:20:36] ascended himself notice his way is
[1:20:39] always up going up going up
[1:20:44] there's got to be above everything
[1:20:47] above everybody so it can look down on
[1:20:53] them send it himself above those stars
[1:20:55] and preached
[1:20:58] the devil preached
[1:21:03] and deceived two-thirds of them now can
[1:21:05] you imagine angels of God that never
[1:21:07] lied angels of God that never said one
[1:21:10] bad word in their life they never smoked
[1:21:13] they never committed never done anything
[1:21:15] wrong in their life and they stood there
[1:21:17] sat there whatever was that we said last
[1:21:19] night and whatever it was that he said
[1:21:21] you talking about a deceiver and then
[1:21:24] Angels sat there and they heard them
[1:21:26] they thought
[1:21:27] this is true
[1:21:30] this is true in the millennium
[1:21:34] he will be bound for a thousand years
[1:21:37] at the end of the Millennium he will be
[1:21:40] loosed out of his prison
[1:21:43] people will have lived in the Millennium
[1:21:46] for a thousand years
[1:21:48] think of it people in natural bodies not
[1:21:52] Saints not elect but people in natural
[1:21:54] bodies will live there for a thousand
[1:21:56] years they've been made to come to the
[1:21:58] house of God if they didn't come to
[1:22:00] church we as the sons of God said just
[1:22:03] because of that you don't get no rain on
[1:22:05] your garden
[1:22:07] is that what the Bible says they're
[1:22:09] supposed to come up to the Feast of
[1:22:10] Tabernacles then that whenever the
[1:22:13] thousand years are expired he will be
[1:22:15] loose out of his prison for a season he
[1:22:18] will go about on the earth deceiving
[1:22:20] them they have just lived a thousand
[1:22:22] years they have lived on the earth with
[1:22:25] glorified Saints and Immortal bodies
[1:22:28] they watched Jews you'll be standing
[1:22:31] there talking to him and that once you
[1:22:33] disappear because father sent you over
[1:22:35] there on the other side of the earth
[1:22:36] somewhere they watched the Lord Jesus
[1:22:39] they watch the great healing come upon
[1:22:42] the Earth they saw the Earth Changed by
[1:22:44] the power of God and at the end of that
[1:22:47] Thousand Years the devil will raise up
[1:22:50] out of his prison and go about and
[1:22:53] deceive millions of them
[1:22:55] they will be so deceived they will come
[1:22:58] up against the holy city
[1:23:00] can you imagine
[1:23:02] they will be so deceived they say I hate
[1:23:05] Jesus
[1:23:07] I hate him I hate Jason I hate Johnny I
[1:23:10] hate them saints
[1:23:13] that should be too hard for us to grasp
[1:23:15] people do it today
[1:23:22] notice this
[1:23:24] the prophet said notice his ambition
[1:23:27] he preached God of this evil age that
[1:23:31] kind of a scientific social educated
[1:23:35] Progressive gospel
[1:23:38] wow him and the devil has a gospel
[1:23:41] what's the word gospel mean good news
[1:23:46] well friends we are living in a
[1:23:49] progressive gospel age

[1:23:57] boys girls loving girls everybody's
[1:23:59] smoking drink and run around doing
[1:24:01] whatever I don't care how they live but
[1:24:02] boy whenever they die it's like the Holy
[1:24:05] Angels From God come down out of heaven
[1:24:07] and packed her Souls away Holy Angels

[1:24:12] put their hands on some of them sorry
[1:24:14] rotten whoremongers and liars and drunks
[1:24:16] and everything else if you ever walk
[1:24:18] down the streets of gold you're gonna
[1:24:20] live a life that reflects the Gospel of
[1:24:23] Jesus Christ amen God is not hard up
[1:24:26] that God has to accept every liar every
[1:24:29] adulterer ever a whoremonger into his
[1:24:32] kingdom straight is away and never is
[1:24:35] the gate that leads to eternal life
[1:24:38] [Applause]
[1:24:44] you can say wise it gets closer and
[1:24:47] closer
[1:24:48] Satan hates us more than ever before
[1:24:53] who knows how much longer we'll be able
[1:24:55] to use YouTube
[1:24:57] who knows how much longer we've done
[1:25:00] been flagged
[1:25:03] I'd be surprised if you ain't we've done
[1:25:04] been flagged by them
[1:25:07] foreign
[1:25:10] what you're going to do keep preaching
[1:25:12] the same thing of course oh what if they
[1:25:14] can't kill they kick me off I'll be
[1:25:16] obedient
[1:25:17] what now brother Tony you've got to use
[1:25:19] wisdom I call that compromise when I
[1:25:22] have to quit preaching against sin I'll
[1:25:24] come off the internet when I have to
[1:25:26] quit preaching against sin I'll come off
[1:25:28] of YouTube well come on because if I
[1:25:31] don't I won't leave this world in
[1:25:33] rapture
[1:25:35] um
[1:25:36] notices in Satan's Eden the God of this
[1:25:39] world today
[1:25:40] the worshiped person
[1:25:43] of this world today
[1:25:46] is Satan
[1:25:49] listen how it's come about and the
[1:25:51] people are ignorant of worshiping Satan
[1:25:55] but it's Satan
[1:25:57] impersonating himself
[1:26:00] as the church
[1:26:07] so he impersonates himself
[1:26:10] as the church
[1:26:12] see us the church and they worship Satan
[1:26:15] thinking they are worshiping God through
[1:26:19] the church
[1:26:21] but it's the way that Satan is in oh you
[1:26:23] say but wait a minute we preach the word
[1:26:25] look back here at my text tonight Satan
[1:26:28] was the one that preached the word
[1:26:33] Lord shielded
[1:26:35] and what word was he preaching
[1:26:38] he was quoting the message of her day
[1:26:43] selectively quoting it
[1:26:47] he didn't jump over and get Noah's
[1:26:49] message he didn't jump back or say that
[1:26:51] in the beginning God created the heavens
[1:26:52] of the earth he didn't jump back her 500
[1:26:55] years or a thousand years but what did
[1:26:57] he do he caught the word of her day and
[1:26:59] said yay
[1:27:04] I want you to notice how he addresses
[1:27:06] her
[1:27:07] you see the Bible tells us in Genesis 1
[1:27:09] in the beginning God chapter one God God
[1:27:13] God
[1:27:14] but when God creates a son
[1:27:18] then he reveals himself in his first
[1:27:20] compound family name Lord God
[1:27:24] Jehovah with his children
[1:27:27] Jehovah Adonai
[1:27:29] Jehovah Elohim the first compound
[1:27:32] revealing of his name the Lord God
[1:27:35] but when the devil come to Eve I want
[1:27:37] you to notice where he reverted back to
[1:27:39] yeh hath God said
[1:27:43] so take her back to an impersonal God a
[1:27:47] God that doesn't really love you a God
[1:27:49] that doesn't really care for you brother
[1:27:51] he's got you defeated right there if he
[1:27:53] makes you can believe that
[1:27:55] notice that would have not had one bit
[1:27:58] of effect on her
[1:28:00] until she took his words into her mind
[1:28:05] and in the womb of her heart she
[1:28:08] conceived and then she sent him right
[1:28:11] back out and said yay God
[1:28:15] he knew right there
[1:28:17] he had her
[1:28:19] he had already changed her view
[1:28:23] of Papa God he was no longer this loving
[1:28:26] wonderful father but he projected God to
[1:28:30] her that he was a mean cruel being that
[1:28:33] was trying to keep something from her
[1:28:39] very impersonal very uncaring
[1:28:42] and as soon as she said it then she
[1:28:46] turns right back around
[1:28:48] and said well God not Lord God
[1:28:53] instead of saying Satan you're a liar my
[1:28:57] father told me not to do this my father
[1:28:59] told me not to do that but what does she
[1:29:01] do she reshapes in her mind this image
[1:29:05] of this God by that one little statement
[1:29:08] God's been cruel to you young ladies
[1:29:12] to make you wear long hair
[1:29:14] wear dresses
[1:29:16] why it's so cruel for you all not to be
[1:29:19] able to smoke cigarettes I disagree I
[1:29:22] think it's cruel to smoke them
[1:29:24] oh y'all's young people's been kept from
[1:29:27] so much they are all types of sexual
[1:29:30] transmitted diseases they're being kept
[1:29:33] from being pregnated before they're
[1:29:34] married they're being kept from a lot of
[1:29:36] this and that and the other don't you
[1:29:37] sit there and look at me and tell me
[1:29:38] that we're robbing our young kids we're
[1:29:41] trying to keep our young kids so when
[1:29:42] they walk before the preacher and they
[1:29:44] get married to that boy or that girl
[1:29:46] amen that they'll be able to raise that
[1:29:48] Veil and kiss for the first time come on
[1:29:51] somebody they'll be able to look at one
[1:29:53] another and they they didn't give
[1:29:55] everything they had because they dressed
[1:29:57] like a street prostitute and they left
[1:29:59] nothing to the imagination but they
[1:30:02] Reserve theirself for their husband come
[1:30:04] on young people they Reserve themself

[1:30:13] God no we want our daughters to marry
[1:30:15] Sons we want our sons to marry Daughters

[1:30:21] out to the Baptist Church and find them
[1:30:23] a while well I want to preach right now
[1:30:25] I don't think our sisters have to go

[1:30:32] right in the ranks of the word get you a
[1:30:35] Son of God that believes the word a Son

[1:30:40] that'll raise your children in the house
[1:30:43] of the Lord
[1:30:46] foreign
[1:30:48] [Applause]
[1:30:53] Satan preaches his gospel
[1:30:55] oh
[1:30:57] God is love
[1:31:01] oh we just all love everything
[1:31:05] I love everybody
[1:31:08] what script are you on
[1:31:11] people have got more scripts and they've
[1:31:13] got scriptures in this day we're living
[1:31:14] in they'll say
[1:31:17] no pun intended brother Andrew
[1:31:22] you see Paul in using this in Ephesians
[1:31:24] 6 12 let's go to the scripture that
[1:31:26] Brothers if you don't mind
[1:31:27] for we wrestle not against flesh and
[1:31:30] blood
[1:31:31] but against principalities and Powers
[1:31:34] against the rulers of the darkness of
[1:31:36] this world against spiritual wickedness
[1:31:37] and high places
[1:31:40] Paul uses a Greek
[1:31:42] athletic term
[1:31:45] wrestle
[1:31:46] the meaning is a contest between two
[1:31:51] and which each Endeavors to throw the
[1:31:55] other
[1:31:57] and which is decided when the victor
[1:32:00] is able to press and hold down his
[1:32:04] prostrate antagonist namely hold him
[1:32:07] down with his hand on his neck
[1:32:14] what a word to choose
[1:32:16] to describe your walk as a Christian
[1:32:20] the loser and a Greek wrestling contest
[1:32:28] no children can't you see the penalty
[1:32:31] can't you see the penalty if we lose
[1:32:34] this match
[1:32:36] we go blind
[1:32:38] [Music]
[1:32:42] see what's happening to people
[1:32:46] when the devil pins them down for so
[1:32:48] long
[1:32:51] then what does he do
[1:32:52] like Samson
[1:32:55] remember before Samson ever lost his
[1:32:57] sight naturally he lost it spiritually
[1:33:06] the loser in the Greek wrestling contest
[1:33:09] had his eyes gouged out
[1:33:12] with resulting blindness
[1:33:15] for the rest of his days can you imagine
[1:33:18] the Ephesian church now when they read
[1:33:20] this epistle from Paul to them with that
[1:33:23] culture meant a lot more than it does to
[1:33:25] us and our Western culture but you
[1:33:27] imagine how it must have gripped their
[1:33:29] hearts and they said oh my God
[1:33:31] help me
[1:33:33] help me
[1:33:34] if he knocks me down lord don't let me
[1:33:37] stay or have you ever been knocked down
[1:33:39] brother Donnie I sure have I've been
[1:33:41] knocked down many a time but I ain't
[1:33:43] going to stay there I'm not going to
[1:33:45] stay there and let him put his hand on
[1:33:47] my never I'm not gonna stay there and
[1:33:50] let him win until he takes his fingers
[1:33:53] and poke out my eyes and I don't know
[1:33:56] what's right and I don't know what's
[1:33:58] wrong I don't know what's today and I
[1:34:00] don't know what's nice if I fall let me
[1:34:03] Rise Again If I Stumble let me rise
[1:34:07] again
[1:34:07] [Applause]
[1:34:09] Hallelujah
[1:34:22] somehow Satan
[1:34:24] has moved into a place
[1:34:27] and this age
[1:34:30] of godship
[1:34:33] not just a prince
[1:34:35] but the god
[1:34:37] of this world
[1:34:41] second Corinthians 4 3 but if our gospel
[1:34:43] be hit
[1:34:44] his head to them that are lost
[1:34:48] listen carefully now
[1:34:50] in whom the God of this world
[1:34:52] has blinded the minds of them which
[1:34:54] believe not lest the lie to the Glorious
[1:34:57] gospel of Christ
[1:34:59] who is the image of God should shine
[1:35:02] unto them so look what Satan does to
[1:35:05] secure their obedience
[1:35:13] my grandfather
[1:35:15] my mother's father
[1:35:17] was blind
[1:35:22] every time I go visit him and my
[1:35:24] grandmother
[1:35:26] always felt so sorry for him
[1:35:28] and being just a little bitty guy
[1:35:30] you know I'd walk in I'd look at him I'd
[1:35:32] speak to him
[1:35:33] he'd say hello Donnie
[1:35:35] a kind of a Gruff voice
[1:35:37] he was very very sensitive to hearing
[1:35:40] you know people without them senses
[1:35:41] sometimes are and he'd be very very
[1:35:43] sensitive
[1:35:45] so I didn't feel comfortable playing
[1:35:47] I didn't feel comfortable in moving
[1:35:49] about because his hearing was so acute
[1:35:52] so I'd go in and just kind of sit there
[1:35:55] and my grandma and Papaw as I call them
[1:35:58] they used to listen they didn't have
[1:36:00] television thank the Lord
[1:36:03] but they used to listen to uh malls
[1:36:06] singing convention
[1:36:08] I see some of you are not in your heads
[1:36:10] and some of you are looking at me like
[1:36:11] I'm from another planet
[1:36:12] you don't want to be talking about do
[1:36:14] you anybody know what my old singing can
[1:36:15] be said Lord have mercy
[1:36:22] whatever's gospel singing and they'd
[1:36:24] come on every night
[1:36:26] and that listened to it and he would not
[1:36:28] want me moving I'd look at him I look at
[1:36:30] him every time every time I look at my
[1:36:32] hands
[1:36:33] like this
[1:36:34] it reminds me of him because my hands
[1:36:36] are almost identical replicas of his
[1:36:40] hands the way my thumb projects out in
[1:36:42] the little concave there so every time I
[1:36:44] look at myself and I spread my hands
[1:36:46] this way I can still remember taking my
[1:36:48] fingers and I'd look up his eyes of
[1:36:50] course he couldn't see me I always
[1:36:52] thought how pitiful it was
[1:36:54] he couldn't see the trees couldn't see
[1:36:57] the flowers
[1:36:58] I guess one thing that hurt me the most
[1:37:00] was he never saw me
[1:37:03] all my whole life he was blind
[1:37:06] so he never saw me
[1:37:08] and I think about people
[1:37:10] one statement in order to keep them so
[1:37:13] my grandfather was totally dependent on
[1:37:16] others to lead him around
[1:37:19] he couldn't go hardly from one room to
[1:37:22] another sure he had a cane and he'd go
[1:37:23] around but he'd get turned around not
[1:37:25] knowing which way he was don't you
[1:37:28] understand why the darkness and the last
[1:37:29] day is prophesied to be so bad
[1:37:32] why because the sins of the nation our
[1:37:35] nation has rejected God and the prophet
[1:37:38] said he didn't pray for him years ago
[1:37:39] what about tonight
[1:37:41] and we look all around us and the land
[1:37:44] we know were the last plagues to strike
[1:37:45] egyptus what deaths and the prophet says
[1:37:48] the last plague to strike the
[1:37:49] Pentecostal Church his spiritual deaths
[1:37:52] and they don't know what's right or
[1:37:54] wrong anymore everything is great well I
[1:37:56] don't know what's right what's wrong
[1:37:58] who's right who's wrong where do we go
[1:37:59] what do we do it's pitiful and when the
[1:38:01] message out of the same way they hear
[1:38:03] this preacher preach them they follow
[1:38:04] that they hear this preacher preach they
[1:38:06] follow that what is it oh God it seems
[1:38:09] like somebody can no longer find out
[1:38:11] what's right or wrong which way do we go
[1:38:14] what do we do
[1:38:18] ah
[1:38:19] so he blinds them
[1:38:24] and that way
[1:38:26] they'll never be able to see the
[1:38:28] precious
[1:38:29] rays of the sunlight of God
[1:38:34] There's A Better Way really
[1:38:37] which way is that
[1:38:40] you don't have to live this way really I
[1:38:42] don't
[1:38:43] so he blinds them
[1:38:45] so all they see is this this world that
[1:38:49] they're in
[1:38:50] do you understand even those that are
[1:38:52] not elected nordained to life if they
[1:38:54] ever saw the mercy of God many of them
[1:38:56] whosoever will that come by the
[1:38:57] multitudes
[1:38:59] but Satan blinds them
[1:39:02] keeps them in this prison
[1:39:04] I'll tell you one thing we ought to be
[1:39:05] the happiest people on the face of the
[1:39:07] Earth
[1:39:09] an evil Wicked ruler
[1:39:13] that puts out the eyes of his people
[1:39:16] before they can catch the splendor
[1:39:19] of this Mighty Prince
[1:39:22] in his glory
[1:39:26] takes away the reasoning of their soul
[1:39:30] blinds them
[1:39:31] into this utter Darkness you see us Eve
[1:39:34] gave him entrance into the human race
[1:39:37] so his church has given him entrance
[1:39:39] into godship
[1:39:42] now please don't misunderstand me
[1:39:45] our lord Jesus to this very day
[1:39:49] has never yet been crowned
[1:39:55] no it's not
[1:39:57] he is high priest
[1:40:00] is that right
[1:40:01] you see the Rapture is him
[1:40:04] stepping aside from the office of high
[1:40:07] priest
[1:40:08] to become fully the Crown King and who
[1:40:12] will crown him his bride will
[1:40:15] so who has given Satan this position in
[1:40:19] the earth and the last day his wife
[1:40:23] his wife is crowning him
[1:40:26] King
[1:40:30] you remember the Song of Solomon
[1:40:32] whatever he was given a crown and he
[1:40:33] says he was given this Crown by his
[1:40:36] mother
[1:40:37] it was his mother of course Bathsheba
[1:40:40] which had given him the crown of his
[1:40:43] nuptials you remember there of course in
[1:40:45] speaking about Bathsheba that she began
[1:40:49] to speak prophecy have you ever noticed
[1:40:51] it or not but Solomon when he wrote
[1:40:53] about her he said that she had
[1:40:56] prophesied or gave him some great words
[1:40:59] and if you look at it she warned him of
[1:41:02] the very thing that was going to cause
[1:41:04] his Falling Away
[1:41:06] remember the prophet tells us that there
[1:41:08] were seven Church agents in the Old
[1:41:09] Testament and seven in the new and
[1:41:11] Solomon was the Ephesian age the
[1:41:13] building of the house of God and yet
[1:41:16] Bathsheba began to warn him quite an
[1:41:19] amazing thing for a woman who walked
[1:41:21] into the pages of the scripture and the
[1:41:22] first time we see her she's beckoned
[1:41:24] into the palace under an act of adultery
[1:41:26] and yet God transformed This Woman's
[1:41:29] life and made her to her amen she not
[1:41:32] only married a king a man who was after
[1:41:35] God's heart but she became a woman after
[1:41:38] God's Own Heart I don't know if you
[1:41:39] under know it or not but proverbs 31 the
[1:41:42] one that we quote so much of who can
[1:41:44] find a virtuous woman it is written in
[1:41:47] the history books and the rabbis and so
[1:41:50] on say that proverbs 31 was written
[1:41:53] after and an epitome he paid to the life
[1:41:56] and the influence of Bathsheba a woman
[1:41:59] that we will look out that there'd be no
[1:42:01] hope and no mercy a woman that seemingly
[1:42:04] wouldn't pass the bounds of Grace but
[1:42:06] yet when you look and see what God done
[1:42:08] and take a woman in that type of a
[1:42:10] scenario and then God turns her life
[1:42:13] around and said who can find a virtuous
[1:42:16] woman her price is far and above rubies
[1:42:19] maybe some of you were women that were
[1:42:22] wrong and men that were wrong and the
[1:42:24] Devil Himself had gave up all hope on
[1:42:26] you but the Lord Jesus got a hold of you
[1:42:29] and he called your name and he raised
[1:42:32] you her and he justified you and he
[1:42:34] Sanctified you and he filled you with
[1:42:37] the Holy Ghost and tonight you said here
[1:42:40] as part of the bride of Christ a bride
[1:42:43] that is far above rubies a bride that is
[1:42:47] worse more than all this world
[1:42:50] [Applause]
[1:42:56] now let me get to my title it's time to
[1:42:58] close
[1:43:02] let's not appreciate about a marvelous
[1:43:04] success so now I don't want to title
[1:43:05] this
[1:43:06] from a success
[1:43:08] to a complete failure
[1:43:13] Ezekiel 28 14.
[1:43:15] Thou Art the anointed cherub
[1:43:18] that cover us
[1:43:20] look at the Hebrew word there to hedge
[1:43:24] fence about
[1:43:26] shut in
[1:43:27] scream
[1:43:29] stop the approach
[1:43:32] Thou Art they anointed cherub that
[1:43:34] covereth
[1:43:35] and I have set thee so
[1:43:39] so oh my thou lust upon the holy
[1:43:43] mountain of God
[1:43:45] thou has walked up and down in the midst
[1:43:48] of the stones of fire
[1:43:51] listen to this now
[1:43:53] what's the prophet as it goes into this
[1:43:55] our bodies were on the earth before
[1:43:57] there was any life we're made of 16
[1:43:59] different elements of the earth as pot
[1:44:01] as calcium petroleum Cosmic light and so
[1:44:04] forth held together by Adams 16 elements
[1:44:07] of the earth and if that is so with
[1:44:09] scientifically so
[1:44:10] then our bodies were laying spread out
[1:44:13] on this Earth before there was any type
[1:44:17] of life
[1:44:18] on the earth so Footprints means
[1:44:21] possession
[1:44:23] so our bodies were laying on the earth
[1:44:26] the substance to make them now not our
[1:44:29] complete body of course you know like it
[1:44:31] is now but the substance to make our
[1:44:33] bodies was laying on the Earth again he
[1:44:37] says calcium petroleum Cosmic light was
[1:44:40] up at the creation as the volcanic was
[1:44:42] thrown out
[1:44:44] they tell us the Earth and so forth it
[1:44:46] was just burning Brimstone I remember
[1:44:50] from the soul of the Earth
[1:44:54] oh I can hear him saying question
[1:44:56] answers on Genesis 1953 let us all step
[1:44:59] up to the banister and let's see this
[1:45:01] story
[1:45:03] and then I I can see this so father God
[1:45:06] speaks the logos let there be light and
[1:45:08] there was light I can see a clinker as
[1:45:11] it comes off the sun and it drops drops
[1:45:14] drops drops this sort of white light
[1:45:17] goes over it and he stops it
[1:45:23] then another one comes what is it he
[1:45:26] said he's riding his first Bible
[1:45:30] so he said the Earth come out of the sun
[1:45:32] oh
[1:45:34] and I'm sure you know it that if you go
[1:45:36] into the soul you dig past the surface
[1:45:39] of the Earth
[1:45:41] and past the core and you go into the
[1:45:44] very heart of the earth and what do you
[1:45:46] find where it came from
[1:45:49] you find the core of the earth is
[1:45:53] identical to the Sun
[1:45:55] wow
[1:45:57] but you got to get past all the rock and
[1:45:59] all the mud and all the dirt and well if
[1:46:02] you take a good look at yourself you'll
[1:46:04] find you're the same way you get past
[1:46:06] all your faults and all your Reagan and
[1:46:08] all your Watkins and all your Smith and
[1:46:10] all this and that and the other and what
[1:46:12] will you find down inside of there
[1:46:14] you'll find a soul that come from God so
[1:46:17] if we look deep enough what do we see in
[1:46:19] the earth we see not just where the
[1:46:21] Earth is going but where the Earth come
[1:46:23] from
[1:46:25] Hallelujah so the core of Earth remember
[1:46:28] the Earth has been through these changes
[1:46:31] over and over again but she has this
[1:46:33] promise you know that the Bible oh I
[1:46:36] love this the Bible has the Earth's name
[1:46:39] written in the Book of Life
[1:46:45] you ever notice the Bible don't call
[1:46:46] Jupiters by name
[1:46:48] Uranus Saturn Mars Pluto
[1:46:54] they said why don't God just get rid of
[1:46:55] the earth he can't
[1:46:57] her name is written in the Book of Life
[1:47:00] and notice what God designated the
[1:47:02] Earth's ass a female
[1:47:05] her she her she she is one of God's
[1:47:09] actually why God doesn't got rid of me
[1:47:11] he can't
[1:47:12] why God doesn't got rid of you I've
[1:47:15] caused him a lot of trouble I've caused
[1:47:17] him a lot of difficulty why can't God
[1:47:19] get rid of you because you're one of his
[1:47:22] attributes
[1:47:24] hallelujah hallelujah that's one reason
[1:47:27] Satan hates you
[1:47:34] so now watch the Earth is spilling out
[1:47:37] of her soil out of her soul rather
[1:47:40] there was no lows Home Depot
[1:47:44] and God needed building material to
[1:47:47] start on the Earth
[1:47:48] so God just from the soul of the Earth
[1:47:51] had the Earth ago
[1:47:57] and the earth started belching out
[1:48:01] on the volcano
[1:48:07] calcium laying over here potash
[1:48:09] petroleum Cosmic light
[1:48:12] copper phosphate 10. all these things
[1:48:16] what's God doing making his lumber yard
[1:48:21] pre-home Depot days
[1:48:26] now remember the devil and his angels
[1:48:28] had done fail you'll imagine now as they
[1:48:30] step brother into wherever it is they're
[1:48:32] out there in the universe we don't know
[1:48:33] exactly wherever they was in the
[1:48:35] universe and they watched God as they
[1:48:37] start expanding his creation
[1:48:40] I just read it day before yesterday that
[1:48:43] right now in the known universe what
[1:48:46] they've been able to see
[1:48:48] they estimate there are 20
[1:48:51] 22
[1:48:53] septillion Stars
[1:48:56] anybody know what septillion means
[1:49:00] 24 zeros
[1:49:06] and what was that problem you had that
[1:49:07] was so big
[1:49:12] oh Hallelujah
[1:49:15] but Satan saw God
[1:49:19] and he said all the rest of these
[1:49:20] stories he thought
[1:49:21] why is he taking particular ah we better
[1:49:26] look at this
[1:49:27] I never seen them do that on all the
[1:49:29] rest of them
[1:49:30] do you know that in What's called the
[1:49:32] elliptical plane
[1:49:34] where we are placed in the milky white
[1:49:37] Galaxy
[1:49:38] that the Stars being visible the Zodiac
[1:49:41] oh you say oh Lord have mercy brother
[1:49:43] darling don't tell me you're going there
[1:49:44] you read the book of Job
[1:49:46] do you know that God quoted to job the
[1:49:49] Bible that job read and what was that
[1:49:51] Bible the Stars God quoted and used the
[1:49:54] word Pleiades which is the Seven Sisters
[1:49:57] God quoted Arcturus is that right well
[1:49:59] don't sit there and look at me funny
[1:50:01] because that was the Bible that job read
[1:50:03] and God quoted the Bible that job
[1:50:05] understood and God put it right there
[1:50:07] but God showed a special affection and a
[1:50:10] special love many years ago when our
[1:50:12] scientists went out and they got so far
[1:50:14] in their spacecraft and they turned the
[1:50:16] great big machine back around and when
[1:50:18] they did they saw what this tiny blue
[1:50:22] Dot
[1:50:25] dot
[1:50:26] Amazing Grace
[1:50:32] when you imagine when Satan looked they
[1:50:34] said oh
[1:50:37] it's mine
[1:50:39] I want that
[1:50:42] that the only place as far as we know
[1:50:44] were the hydrogen the oxygen the water
[1:50:47] the atmosphere is just right for life if
[1:50:52] we were just a few thousand light years
[1:50:55] closer to the CERN we'd be burnt up if
[1:50:57] it was very much farther out would be so
[1:50:59] cold and frigid we could never have life
[1:51:01] but whoever it was that put us here put
[1:51:05] us here for a purpose do you understand
[1:51:07] that where we are whenever the
[1:51:09] spaceships go out and look back and they
[1:51:11] start looking at the constellations they
[1:51:13] don't even recognize nothing that we see
[1:51:16] from here it's like whoever put us here
[1:51:19] wrote this story up here but you got to
[1:51:22] be right here to look up and read it
[1:51:25] oh
[1:51:27] Oh Glory to God
[1:51:29] God wanted a bride reads the word and to
[1:51:32] her it makes perfect sense others look
[1:51:34] at it and say
[1:51:36] I don't know what it means
[1:51:39] you got to be at the right place you got
[1:51:42] to be at the right elliptical plane in
[1:51:44] order to look back that's why God sent
[1:51:45] us a prophet
[1:51:47] you remember when they sent Hubble out
[1:51:49] there several years ago and Hubble was
[1:51:51] kind of cross-eyed
[1:51:53] you remember that show they had to make
[1:51:55] some lenses like glasses and send it out
[1:51:58] there and put on Hubble and once they
[1:52:00] did then Hubble got all straightened up
[1:52:04] oh that's sort of the way we was was
[1:52:06] reading in the Bible in this cross side
[1:52:08] was reading about election and we can
[1:52:10] turn it like this and look at it like
[1:52:12] him it turned upside down said well I
[1:52:14] don't know I said one God I say two or
[1:52:16] the three so God sent us a pair of
[1:52:18] Malachi four glasses
[1:52:21] amen he said all right brother I'd slip
[1:52:24] these on oh well I see now they ate
[1:52:27] three but they are one they are one
[1:52:30] they're three manifestations of the same
[1:52:32] God
[1:52:33] [Applause]
[1:52:33] [Music]
[1:52:40] oh
[1:52:42] it was burning brimstone
[1:52:44] it was Satan's possession
[1:52:49] as he walked up and down the fiery
[1:52:52] brimstone
[1:52:54] of the Earth
[1:52:56] so when it's going through this volcanic
[1:52:58] stage it's blowing and blowing and
[1:53:00] blowing and Satan's in there walking all
[1:53:03] over and said I like it
[1:53:06] I like it
[1:53:08] I want it
[1:53:10] I can tell he's showing special favor to
[1:53:13] this one and anything he loves I want
[1:53:21] no friends
[1:53:22] no that's for sure it's not because
[1:53:25] we're so special
[1:53:26] it's because of the special grace of God
[1:53:29] we're no better than the rest of
[1:53:30] humanity out here we don't know better
[1:53:32] than your family your sisters your
[1:53:34] mothers your brothers some of you may be
[1:53:35] sitting here tonight and not another
[1:53:37] member of your family believes the word
[1:53:38] of the hour God smiled upon you and gave
[1:53:40] you Grace
[1:53:41] well I must have prayed more I must have
[1:53:43] fasted more it ain't nothing one would
[1:53:45] want one good thing not one Superior
[1:53:48] thing that you could do it was the grace
[1:53:50] of God and the pattern fell right on you
[1:53:53] before the foundation of the world
[1:53:56] oh let me find a place to close
[1:54:00] notice this in that day on Calvary for
[1:54:02] Satan happiers
[1:54:06] Satan had the Earth of furry rocks that
[1:54:09] he walked up and down on the Earth's
[1:54:11] burning brimstones
[1:54:13] Lucifer was the son of the morning so
[1:54:15] when the sun before the natural sun rose
[1:54:18] on the Earth the Sun of the morning
[1:54:20] Lucifer
[1:54:22] was walking on the earth and Volcanic
[1:54:24] stage
[1:54:26] he's breaking forth the day
[1:54:29] haha
[1:54:30] wow
[1:54:32] those same rocks that had cooled off
[1:54:36] when Jesus died at Calvary
[1:54:39] belch's Force out of the Earth
[1:54:43] wow
[1:54:45] so the devil had made Footprints
[1:54:47] apparently on some of them rocks and
[1:54:50] they'd been buried in time
[1:54:52] and Jesus said I'm going to show who
[1:54:54] owns this place now
[1:54:56] so he began to shake the arrow like a
[1:54:58] good Holy Ghost meat well Glory Glory
[1:55:01] Glory somebody touched me I'll record it
[1:55:05] and then Ross go to shape well come on

[1:55:10] shaken so in Jesus all mine when he died
[1:55:12] and the Rocks got to shake and it got to
[1:55:15] moving around I'll never forget it years
[1:55:17] and years ago I've taken my girls and we
[1:55:19] went down

[1:55:24] Tennessee that Hidden Lake down there
[1:55:26] saying anybody ever seen that that Lost
[1:55:27] Sea we got down in there and one of them

[1:55:33] of things at all but we got down in
[1:55:34] there looking around that guy was
[1:55:36] telling us they said well these rocks
[1:55:38] are so many millions of years old and
[1:55:39] this and that doesn't happen to him but
[1:55:41] he said right here it's the most recent
[1:55:43] rockfall that we've been able to find to
[1:55:46] this day and it happened about two
[1:55:48] thousand years ago
[1:55:52] laughs
[1:55:53] [Laughter]
[1:55:56] Oh Glory to God I said amen he looked at
[1:56:01] me really funny he didn't know what I
[1:56:03] knew but I knew exactly I thought I know
[1:56:05] exactly what was going on I began to
[1:56:07] look around for the devil's footprint
[1:56:09] because I thought it must be somewhere
[1:56:10] it must be in your somewhere well he had
[1:56:13] his footprint all over me and he had it
[1:56:15] all over you and the Holy Ghost got a
[1:56:18] hold to me and got to hold to you and
[1:56:20] broke that hole to the devil on our
[1:56:23] lives and said he don't belong to you no
[1:56:26] more he belongs to me
[1:56:29] she is mine
[1:56:31] [Applause]

[1:56:51] perfect
[1:56:55] hole
[1:56:56] entire
[1:56:58] wholesome
[1:57:00] unimpaired innocent
[1:57:03] having integrity
[1:57:06] wow what is complete entirely in a court
[1:57:12] with truth
[1:57:14] and fact
[1:57:18] now this is describing
[1:57:21] Lucifer
[1:57:22] before he become the devil
[1:57:27] perfect whole
[1:57:29] he was in fact he was right and tied in
[1:57:32] with truths in fact
[1:57:35] it's hard to imagine that that become
[1:57:37] what we know today
[1:57:40] is the devil
[1:57:41] isn't it
[1:57:44] so he was a perfect created being
[1:57:48] as a matter of fact he was
[1:57:50] the crowning achievement
[1:57:54] of God's Great Angelic Realm
[1:58:02] Angelic Realm
[1:58:04] perfect
[1:58:05] sinless
[1:58:15] but listen at verse 16. by the multitude
[1:58:18] of thy merchandise
[1:58:20] they have failed the midst of thee with
[1:58:22] violence
[1:58:23] and thou has sinned
[1:58:26] therefore I will cast thee as profane
[1:58:29] out of the Mountain of God
[1:58:34] that he was successful
[1:58:36] but he will lose
[1:58:41] had a famous trial here in your country
[1:58:45] y'all know about it now
[1:58:49] a great Dynasty I guess we'd say of a
[1:58:52] family that goes back for many many
[1:58:53] years and yeah had all this wealth and
[1:58:57] this power and this and that and the
[1:58:58] other wind up in prison
[1:59:01] no telling what crime has been committed
[1:59:04] by people in such power that is nothing
[1:59:07] compared to this
[1:59:11] but this is what God Said I will
[1:59:15] I will
[1:59:17] destroy thee
[1:59:20] now that may not make you happy but that
[1:59:23] makes me feel like Shout

[1:59:52] of thy Beauty
[1:59:54] thou Hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason
[1:59:58] of thy brightness
[2:00:02] so he corrupted his wisdom because he
[2:00:05] looked at himself he must have been
[2:00:08] something
[2:00:10] my goodness
[2:00:12] oh
[2:00:14] Lord help us
[2:00:15] I will cast thee
[2:00:18] to the ground

[2:00:37] who them Kings is going to be
[2:00:41] I wonder if it's some of them same ones

[2:00:48] our God
[2:00:50] oh you imagine them Devils that have

[2:02:18] multitude of thine iniquities
[2:02:20] by the iniquity of thy traffic
[2:02:24] brother Kenny I found this to be one of
[2:02:25] the most interesting words as I was
[2:02:27] looking at this today the Hebrew words
[2:02:30] are used for traffic
[2:02:32] I just thought is that true can that be
[2:02:35] true
[2:02:36] but what it was the traffic was him
[2:02:39] slandering God
[2:02:44] he was slandering God to his angels and
[2:02:49] eventually talk them out
[2:02:51] of their position
[2:02:53] so he was trafficking slander
[2:02:56] he was trafficking all these you know
[2:02:59] accusations against God Lord have mercy
[2:03:02] children
[2:03:03] can you imagine when people go to
[2:03:05] trafficking lies against God's prophet
[2:03:07] and trafficking lies against the bride
[2:03:10] where they're getting their anointing
[2:03:12] from
[2:03:16] foreign
[2:03:19] that the iniquity of that traffic
[2:03:22] therefore will I bring forth a fire

[2:09:58] have not been the subject of God Sam
[2:10:00] said I lost test five day
[2:10:04] I've got a daughter
[2:10:07] her name is Erica Parker
[2:10:10] she's a mother of two sets of twin girls
[2:10:15] she's been a good little girl she gave
[2:10:16] her heart to me when she's this young
[2:10:17] preachers girl
[2:10:19] she's mean or the snake before she got
[2:10:20] saved boy she's a good one she got to
[2:10:22] say
[2:10:27] you like to testify
[2:10:30] she'll serve me
[2:10:32] even if I allow neuroendocrine tumor
[2:10:35] to get inside of her body by the time
[2:10:38] the doctors find it it'll be stage four
[2:10:42] and one of metastasized and to this very
[2:10:45] day the doctor still don't know where it
[2:10:46] even started
[2:10:48] this is only the baby that they're
[2:10:50] dealing with they call it because they
[2:10:52] still don't know where the mother is
[2:10:54] well I don't know what the mother is and
[2:10:55] I ain't ridiculate that much concerned
[2:10:57] about the baby what I'll know is I know
[2:10:59] who our father is
[2:11:04] and God said her daddy
[2:11:07] is my servant
[2:11:09] it'll break his heart
[2:11:12] his wife my daughter
[2:11:15] her sister is my daughter
[2:11:17] her husband
[2:11:18] her two daughters
[2:11:21] it will affect people around the world
[2:11:24] they'll cry they'll pray for her
[2:11:27] and I'm going to testify for whatever
[2:11:29] happens when it's all said and done
[2:11:31] that'll all be stronger
[2:11:33] and they'll love me even more than they
[2:11:35] do now
[2:11:38] I imagine the Lord must have had a
[2:11:39] similar testimony meeting
[2:11:41] not too often long ago and he said
[2:11:44] I've got a daughter down there her name
[2:11:45] is Debbie Debbie Watkins
[2:11:50] or she loves me
[2:11:52] her husband's my servant
[2:11:54] but I'm gonna allow her to go through
[2:11:56] something like she ain't never been
[2:11:58] through before
[2:11:59] she'll go to doctors and they'll do
[2:12:01] tests and they'll do this and that and
[2:12:02] the other
[2:12:04] but I want to testify for whatever
[2:12:06] happens
[2:12:07] she's going to come out on the other
[2:12:08] side stronger than she's ever been
[2:12:10] before
[2:12:11] oh Lord God
[2:12:15] is that what you want God to be able to
[2:12:17] say about you wouldn't it be awful if
[2:12:19] God had to say about us in heaven I
[2:12:21] can't let nothing come on them they're
[2:12:23] such a baby they're so spoiled I've got
[2:12:25] to keep them in a glass of bubble uh if
[2:12:27] they don't go to church in two or three
[2:12:29] services and don't feel me and write
[2:12:30] them down the house I think ain't even
[2:12:32] been to church I don't want God to say
[2:12:34] that about me
[2:12:36] I ain't standing in line for trials I'm
[2:12:38] the first one to tell you that tonight
[2:12:39] but if he and his wisdom sends them my
[2:12:42] way I know he'll bring me through them I
[2:12:45] don't always know the outcome I don't
[2:12:47] know how they'll end up but I know no
[2:12:49] matter how they end up he'll have his
[2:12:51] way in my life
[2:12:54] Hallelujah
[2:12:56] Hallelujah and when it's all said and
[2:12:58] done
[2:12:59] this is why I want you to find my
[2:13:01] position
[2:13:02] [Music]
[2:13:03] and I want that Devil's tongue I'm about
[2:13:05] that far out of his mouth and him a bag
[2:13:08] and then I carrying on and hollered is
[2:13:10] that where you want him
[2:13:12] oh listen brother sister right here men
[2:13:14] women boys and girls we can all stand
[2:13:16] right here on this same Plateau that's
[2:13:18] exactly what God wants every one of you
[2:13:20] to be his Overcomers
[2:13:22] he is a loser you think he don't know
[2:13:26] these things
[2:13:28] now what if God had wrote just a few
[2:13:30] scriptures in the Bible and God would
[2:13:32] have said there'll be a boy that'll be
[2:13:34] born in July the 9th 1956. his name will
[2:13:37] be Donald Lee Reagan Jr
[2:13:40] I'll hate him
[2:13:41] I'll never save him I'll never do
[2:13:44] nothing with him he was rotten to the
[2:13:46] core I'll never give him no Grace
[2:13:48] [Music]
[2:13:49] then it just so happened years later I
[2:13:52] felt God pulling on my heart and
[2:13:53] somebody showed me that scripture in the
[2:13:54] Bible
[2:13:55] God said don't leave Reagan Jared and I
[2:13:57] think man I feel sorry for that poor guy
[2:13:59] there must be two of us in the Earth
[2:14:03] the devil reads all this don't you know
[2:14:05] he goes to church every weekend he hears
[2:14:07] these message preachers they tear his
[2:14:09] heart off
[2:14:11] they blast him every time he goes to
[2:14:13] church he's the most faithful member of
[2:14:15] God
[2:14:16] he don't pay tithes but at least he
[2:14:18] shows up
[2:14:20] well come on he's more faithful than
[2:14:21] some of the people who call me pastor I
[2:14:24] tear him up every time I get a chance I
[2:14:26] call him a liar to his face I tell him

[2:14:30] going to be destroyed he fights

[2:14:36] sees he's going to be annihilated
[2:14:39] weren't preached to us all the time that
[2:14:40] we're the winners we look in the back of
[2:14:42] the book and find out we're the winners
[2:14:44] and we act like we're the losers
[2:14:47] and he looks in the back of the book and

[2:35:30] do away with
[2:35:33] I want every influence of him and my
[2:35:38] life done away with
[2:35:42] how's God going to do that by his word
[2:35:46] the very word you heard tonight if
[2:35:48] you'll take it and believe it it'll
[2:35:50] destroy the impact it'll destroy every
[2:35:51] trace of the devil out of your life you
[2:35:54] know I was thinking to myself that
[2:35:57] Donnie was talking about there at the
[2:35:59] very end and
[2:36:01] my goodness
[2:36:04] how Dreadful it would be I thought to
[2:36:06] myself if I was standing here and I was
[2:36:08] such a person
[2:36:10] that that all God ever got out of me was
[2:36:14] just a belly aching and complaining and
[2:36:17] and he had no confidence in me and he
[2:36:19] had to constantly pump me up and
[2:36:21] constantly pump me up and constantly
[2:36:22] give me another you know another another
[2:36:24] meeting another meeting another and and
[2:36:26] and and and no no virtue no strength to
[2:36:29] to be an overcomer to press through
[2:36:31] trials I just thought you know I want my
[2:36:34] heavenly father to be proud of me
[2:36:36] and there's nothing wrong in that you
[2:36:38] know I
[2:36:39] I my dad was that way
[2:36:42] and you know brother Eddie was not one
[2:36:45] to hide his pride in his children and I
[2:36:49] can remember so many times that
[2:36:52] you know he would just he was look at me
[2:36:54] and he was so proud and that smile I can
[2:36:58] still see it in my mind's eye he never
[2:37:00] held back praise he never held back his
[2:37:03] pride he always always rewarded a job
[2:37:06] well done
[2:37:07] you know listen friends I don't have a
[2:37:10] clue I I can't account for how you came
[2:37:13] into the world or what your dad did or
[2:37:15] didn't do but I'm here to tell you
[2:37:17] there's a heavenly father who can be
[2:37:19] proud of you
[2:37:20] a Heavenly Father you say I want him to
[2:37:22] be proud of me tonight and he'll smile
[2:37:25] right down on your life right where you
[2:37:27] stand tonight now how many want that
[2:37:29] kind of heavenly father
[2:37:31] oh my I thought about how that the how
[2:37:34] that Lucifer brother only made that
[2:37:36] statement I think he was
[2:37:38] reading from that quote there
[2:37:40] Lucifer
[2:37:42] betrayed Michael
[2:37:48] he betrayed betrayal is a terrible thing
[2:37:52] because you had such confidence and you
[2:37:54] had such friendship and you had trust
[2:37:56] and you put yourself on the line and you
[2:37:59] you went you went you you pulled your
[2:38:02] weight and you got betrayed
[2:38:05] and I thought to myself
[2:38:07] I wonder
[2:38:09] if there are people
[2:38:11] in here tonight
[2:38:13] who've been betrayed by Lucifer the same
[2:38:16] way
[2:38:21] fancy lie eyes about what he would do
[2:38:23] for you and you'd have more friends and
[2:38:25] you'd have this this life and that life
[2:38:27] and this would be better for you and
[2:38:28] this would be better maybe maybe in a
[2:38:30] marriage somewhere in here tonight he
[2:38:31] made you some false promise and now he
[2:38:34] he's betrayed you and you say I I've
[2:38:37] been betrayed all the all the promise
[2:38:40] that he made me is nothing but lies and
[2:38:42] my life is broken oh my I'm gonna tell
[2:38:45] you something friends I thought about
[2:38:46] how that how that you know we're not to
[2:38:49] be like Eve because he he betrayed Eve
[2:38:52] the same way
[2:38:53] and I thought this to myself I thought I
[2:38:56] wonder if in this building tonight
[2:38:59] if there's anybody who can relate and
[2:39:02] say you know I thought I wonder if
[2:39:03] there's anybody in this building tonight
[2:39:05] that Lucifer maybe is just in the last
[2:39:09] stages
[2:39:11] of betrayal
[2:39:13] and he's got you on a string and you sit
[2:39:15] in this building tonight and you've
[2:39:17] heard the word and you've heard enough
[2:39:19] word that you ought to have gone free
[2:39:21] from every influence of the devil I'm
[2:39:24] here to tell you he's a liar and he's a
[2:39:27] betrayer and he does he does nothing his
[2:39:30] only motive is to destroy and to kill
[2:39:34] and I thought to myself you know Satan
[2:39:37] he he loves everything that God makes
[2:39:41] beautiful
[2:39:43] and he loves to ruin it
[2:39:47] I want to tell you something you young
[2:39:49] men you young women and the beauty of
[2:39:52] Life Satan desires that you hear that
[2:39:55] teenagers you you you say oh I'm doing
[2:39:58] fine don't don't imagine that he's not
[2:40:00] lurking that betrayer is looking to take
[2:40:04] that beauty and it won't even take him
[2:40:06] very long and he'll steal it from you
[2:40:07] and he'll steal your joy and he'll steal
[2:40:10] your happiness and he'll steal your life
[2:40:12] if you let him I say we don't let him I
[2:40:14] say we call down the power of God this
[2:40:17] the word has exposed this betrayer he's
[2:40:20] not your friend
[2:40:21] he betrayed Michael he betrayed Eve he's
[2:40:24] betraying people he's trying to betray
[2:40:26] people tonight I just say not me not me

[2:40:31] got a father who loves me and I want
[2:40:33] that father to be proud of me I want to
[2:40:36] have this same word bring me to the same
