[48:42] God bless you friend you can be
[48:47] seated praise the
[48:53] Lord so somebody's got to prove it yeah
[48:57] somebody's got
[48:59] to live in such a way that the word of
[49:03] God is verified to a world who does not
[49:09] think that it should be taken so
[49:11] literally now I'm not judging the world
[49:14] I'm just calling it like we all see it
[49:16] amen it's very obvious friends that the
[49:19] world has you know relegated the Bible
[49:23] uh to just you know almost like like a a
[49:27] buffet like aorus board like you can
[49:29] pick and choose like parts of it are
[49:32] good and relevant other parts of it are
[49:34] not necessary not relevant and I always
[49:37] find that the parts that people want to
[49:39] make irrelevant and old and old
[49:41] fulfilled and we don't have to do that
[49:43] anymore are the parts that talk about
[49:46] how we ought to live holy and acceptable
[49:50] unto
[49:51] God and there's where everybody wants a
[49:55] a more modern approach to the gospel
[49:58] well I'm I I there you know there's no
[50:01] such thing as a modern gospel there's an
[50:04] eternal gospel and it transcends time
[50:07] don't cheapen the gospel by calling it
[50:10] modern or oldfashioned to say it's
[50:12] Eternal it's the mind of God and where
[50:15] and whatever age I was going to live in
[50:17] I want to prove that it's true I would
[50:20] like my last breath if that's tonight I
[50:23] want my last breath to say God is true
[50:27] and the devil is a
[50:31] liar sound like you're with me in
[50:36] that you
[50:38] know God deployed his last messenger of
[50:42] the age he had seven stars in his right
[50:46] hand he Meed them out down through 2,000
[50:49] years across seven Church ages finally
[50:52] it came to the last day and the last
[50:56] star and his right hand was deployed to
[50:58] the Earth he ran his course left us a
[51:01] message went home to his reward and as I
[51:04] said and so say I again tag you're it
[51:08] amen we don't need any of the messengers
[51:11] to come back into this age and prove the
[51:14] word is true we it is up to us to prove
[51:17] that what they told us was the word is
[51:21] true see he was sent as every messenger
[51:26] was
[51:27] to reflect the light of the coming son
[51:29] that's the s o n and the Su n as we
[51:33] would talk when we talk about the suum
[51:35] we're talking about the light of God's
[51:37] word and the light of God's word is the
[51:40] spirit of Christ and so so we find that
[51:43] that is life and that that is light
[51:45] brother Brandon made an amazing
[51:47] statement how that he said that that the
[51:49] word that we have is the spirit the Holy
[51:53] Spirit made word amen think about that
[51:56] statement that's that's amazing I I
[51:59] thought about people who who have a
[52:01] problem when when a when when a prophet
[52:03] explains how that the how that the the
[52:07] the word you know is is now when when we
[52:10] say you walk in the light as he's in the
[52:13] light then the blood of Jesus Christ
[52:14] cleanses us from all sin so we realize
[52:17] that the word of this hour is connected
[52:19] to the blood of Christ because nobody
[52:22] has that physical chemistry of his
[52:25] blood and and he and so in that case
[52:27] we're all finished anyway we might as
[52:29] well you know take our ball and go home
[52:32] be but but we realize that we don't need
[52:34] the chemistry we have the life that was
[52:38] in the blood and that life is made into
[52:41] word and I'm eating it and if I eat the
[52:43] word what do I
[52:45] become and then if I become the word
[52:47] then the blood applies to
[52:50] me
[52:51] see so we're not saying anything that
[52:54] should shock people when we say you have
[53:00] to be a believer and a partaker of the
[53:04] word for your hour if you expect the
[53:07] blood to speak for
[53:10] you that's easy to prove in the
[53:14] Bible and so a messenger came to our day
[53:18] reflecting the light and and you know
[53:21] there there there's such a promise in
[53:23] the word of God for you and I of where
[53:24] we're going to friends I'm here to tell
[53:26] you we're on a journey and we're going
[53:28] somewhere and we're almost home amen
[53:31] we've been uh the bride of Christ has
[53:33] been moving in this direction for 20
[53:36] centuries and she you say she's at she's
[53:40] at the end time she's at the end of the
[53:42] end time because the end time you know
[53:45] even even in a broad in the broadest
[53:47] sense the whole new testament era is the
[53:50] last
[53:51] days sure because one day with the Lord
[53:54] is a thousand years and even even a
[53:56] prophet talks about that the last two
[53:58] the last 2,000 years you have to
[54:01] understand that the Earth went 4,000
[54:03] years waiting on a jubilee waiting on a
[54:06] promise that the spirit of God would
[54:09] finally come and live inside of human
[54:11] beings that was always the plan that was
[54:14] always what the Holy Ghost was going to
[54:16] be it was going to be your creator
[54:19] living inside you it wasn't possible he
[54:22] could come on his family he could anoint
[54:24] them but he couldn't remain there
[54:27] because the the Lamb of God had not been
[54:29] offered you know it's the for he he
[54:32] could not remain even on
[54:34] prophets
[54:36] indefinitely and he couldn't re he
[54:38] couldn't remain on people indefinitely
[54:41] for the same reason that the Lord said
[54:44] to Moses Moses I cannot dwell among
[54:47] these people because they're stiff neck
[54:49] they're rebellious and I will just
[54:51] slaughter them if I do cuz I'm holy and
[54:54] I can't I can't countenance that kind of
[54:56] rebellious attitude so I I won't be able
[54:59] to dwell myself in the midst of them but
[55:02] I'll send my angel and he will dwell
[55:05] among you now fear Him listen to his
[55:07] word because that's just God in another
[55:10] office hallelujah it's an office where
[55:13] where God can come down and have mercy
[55:16] for his
[55:18] family see and so for that same reason
[55:20] he couldn't he couldn't dwell
[55:22] permanently within unconverted people
[55:24] that's why John was told when you
[55:27] finally see a human being that the
[55:30] spirit of God comes upon and remains
[55:33] that'll be the Messiah and he'll be a
[55:36] road map he'll be the blueprint he'll be
[55:38] the Prototype I'm going to have a whole
[55:40] Kingdom like
[55:42] him Hallelujah and so this message has
[55:46] come to reflect the light of this coming
[55:48] son when we're going to be restored
[55:50] under such glory and such Dominion that
[55:53] Adam had back in the Garden of Eden and
[55:56] then this was really the burden this was
[55:58] the constant constant um it was a major
[56:03] theme of William bram's Ministry that
[56:05] we're going back to something this is
[56:08] why he took the time to preach many
[56:10] hours on the future home this is why he
[56:13] took hours to preach things that are to
[56:15] be and tell you about the kind of body
[56:17] you're going to have Hallelujah this was
[56:19] why he took hours to preach leadership
[56:21] to show you how to get there oh my
[56:24] friends this is exactly why
[56:26] that he showed Christ as the mystery of
[56:28] God revealed and took hours to do it so
[56:31] that you would understand that you're in
[56:33] the picture you're with Christ you're
[56:36] the third event now we're being restored
[56:38] back to the Garden like Adam had
[56:43] it he's he he spent 2,000
[56:47] years he spent 2,000
[56:51] years in in the second stage first was
[56:54] to to fully reveal himself in in Christ
[56:57] and then for 2,000 years to prove that
[56:59] he had preeminence in his body the bride
[57:01] but then the last event comes a Capstone
[57:04] when the when the dead in Christ for
[57:06] hundreds of years will rise and we which
[57:09] are alive and remain shall be changed
[57:11] Hallelujah I believe we're right on that
[57:16] friends such power such Glory such
[57:19] Dominion that we're headed back to
[57:21] brother Brandon when he's preaching
[57:22] things that are to be he's so caught up
[57:24] in the realization of what that means
[57:27] and and what was coming because now the
[57:30] the book was open the book that had been
[57:32] closed sealed up under Seven Seals and
[57:35] and now more there's being more revealed
[57:38] than just brother M I'm starting to
[57:40] understand the separation between
[57:43] salvation from destruction and full
[57:46] Redemption and he's starting to he's now
[57:48] he's understanding that it's more that
[57:51] predestination is more and I'll have to
[57:53] be real careful here because this is
[57:54] where we're going to uh of where we're
[57:56] going to end up Sunday but he's
[57:58] understanding that real
[58:00] predestination yes it's true it is it is
[58:04] as brother brandom constantly described
[58:06] it's just a simple thing he said I know
[58:07] your Baptist don't like that word and
[58:09] boy they don't I said it to a Baptist
[58:11] and he was ready to fight me and I
[58:13] didn't I I thought man I mean am my
[58:16] understanding brother Brandon right so I
[58:17] said it to a Baptist and wow you learned
[58:21] what not to say that's a I mean you're
[58:24] talking about getting triggered why wow
[58:26] and so so I and and I just said well
[58:29] look I'm only I'm only quoting you what
[58:32] it says in the Bible and with his own
[58:33] fist he come down and smashed I think he
[58:35] wanted to smash me but he smashed the
[58:38] Bible and hard and he says you know it
[58:41] don't it don't mean that and I said well
[58:45] I'm not really trying to tell you what
[58:46] it means I'm just telling you what it
[58:48] said I I'm all doing is reading it I
[58:51] don't understand why you need me to tell
[58:53] you what it means it's plain language
[58:55] whom he did for no he did also
[58:57] predestinate how's that hard to get see
[59:01] and and so so we find but brother
[59:03] brandham realize that it's it's more he
[59:06] would try to explain you know how why do
[59:08] you think that's hard to do when an all-
[59:10] knowing omniscient God who's all knowing
[59:12] fills all time space and Eternity how
[59:15] hard would it be for that kind of a
[59:17] being to know the end from the beginning
[59:19] and arrange in the middle he could
[59:21] predestinate by his for knowledge and
[59:22] brother brandham said that for years and
[59:24] years and years until finally he began
[59:26] to realize as the word began to be open
[59:28] and the seals began to break free then
[59:31] he realizes it's actually a little more
[59:33] than that that there is actually a
[59:35] deposit called a gene that God places in
[59:37] his family and his elect or his or his
[59:41] family by
[59:42] origin Hallelujah and that's why Jesus
[59:46] could so confidently say not lose one of
[59:53] them so excuse me for bubling with this
[59:56] mic it's just giving me some trouble
[59:58] tonight it's all
[1:00:00] right right we'll tighten it up a little
[1:00:03] bit so so we find out then that you know
[1:00:07] he's the realization of what it means
[1:00:10] and the bodies that we're going to have
[1:00:13] and what is being revealed under
[1:00:15] Redemption and how that the we're at the
[1:00:18] stage this is what this is what becoming
[1:00:20] reality to him my the Jews are in the
[1:00:22] Homeland it was 3 minutes till midnight
[1:00:25] and and they're waiting on Messiah and
[1:00:28] and wow he can see it under the first
[1:00:30] woe and the second woe and it's all
[1:00:31] starting to come together and he starts
[1:00:33] he starts proving by his teaching
[1:00:35] Through the Bible and all you got to do
[1:00:37] is go along with him and you see how
[1:00:38] airtight the case is how that the seals
[1:00:41] and the trumpets and the vials and the
[1:00:43] woes and they're all working in a
[1:00:45] cluster and they're all happening
[1:00:48] they're all end time events as they
[1:00:49] winding up and the prophet is realizing
[1:00:52] that that we're right on the right on
[1:00:54] the edge of it and and he's revealing
[1:00:56] and all these things are being revealed
[1:00:58] and here he is you know and he's living
[1:01:01] under the effects of this and what it
[1:01:03] meant to him to realize that he actually
[1:01:05] wasn't
[1:01:08] crazy and the world thought he was and
[1:01:10] even he wondered and asked his wife mey
[1:01:12] have I lost my mind you know here's a
[1:01:15] man that filled up you know tens of
[1:01:17] thousands of people and a and and
[1:01:19] emptied hospitals and prayer lines for
[1:01:21] city blocks and here's a man who stood
[1:01:23] in a prayer line and never left it for
[1:01:25] for 3 days and slept and ate in the pull
[1:01:28] pit and and and had meetings where every
[1:01:30] single person was
[1:01:34] healed and now here he is and all doors
[1:01:37] are closing to him and he's just got the
[1:01:39] Full Gospel businessman and what's going
[1:01:41] on and all men have forsaken me but I'm
[1:01:45] here to tell you there was one man who
[1:01:46] had not forsook him and there's a bride
[1:01:49] who's not forsaking him there were
[1:01:51] Eagles saying that's the kind of food
[1:01:53] we've been looking for
[1:01:58] see he said you know don't you feel
[1:02:01] brother Brandon makes this statement you
[1:02:02] know don't you feel that
[1:02:06] travail it's beginning to be evening
[1:02:09] time see and and so you know we now all
[1:02:14] right there you
[1:02:16] go I could I could spend the rest of my
[1:02:19] sermon but I would just be telling you
[1:02:22] what you already know that the
[1:02:24] miraculous was UN paralleled yes am the
[1:02:28] scale of the supernatural was almost
[1:02:32] Stupify where you've got men great men
[1:02:35] not not William bram's own testimony
[1:02:37] great men who are received as great men
[1:02:39] like men like or Roberts and Tommy osbor
[1:02:41] and men like that and George Z zaz
[1:02:45] Cliffe and and you you've got Gordon
[1:02:47] Lindsay and these are well-respected
[1:02:50] Scholars who are not following his
[1:02:52] message but they're all testifying to
[1:02:54] the accuracy of that gift and the and
[1:02:57] the and the quality of Christianity that
[1:03:00] the man
[1:03:01] lived or Robert said that flatly in his
[1:03:04] testimony said it is obvious that no I
[1:03:08] forget how the quote goes exactly but
[1:03:11] that there was no case considered
[1:03:14] difficult amen when they came before
[1:03:17] William
[1:03:18] brandham all the other guys in the field
[1:03:21] man we this is a tough one W this is man
[1:03:24] look at the condition of this person but
[1:03:25] let's dis
[1:03:26] but he he just said but when it came
[1:03:27] before William brandom and that angel of
[1:03:29] the Lord began to come around and Robert
[1:03:31] said there was there was no case
[1:03:32] considered even
[1:03:35] difficult I was telling my wife here
[1:03:39] there I was listening and heard a quote
[1:03:41] of brother brandham where he's standing
[1:03:43] there in a prayer line and and a man
[1:03:46] comes up for prayer and he's and brother
[1:03:49] brandham says sir I'm um I'm sorry I
[1:03:51] can't I'm not going to pray for
[1:03:53] you and the man was like what do you
[1:03:56] mean I've waited in this prayer line are
[1:03:58] you how arrogant why are you not going
[1:04:00] to pray for me sir and brother Brandon
[1:04:03] and his hum Bo sir you know sir um you
[1:04:06] don't want me to say no I want you to
[1:04:09] say I demand to know this man's not
[1:04:11] going to pray for me well sir it's
[1:04:13] because you're having an affair with
[1:04:15] your
[1:04:17] secretary and the Lord is not goingon to
[1:04:19] even let me pray for you and the man
[1:04:23] Ducks his head and flies off the
[1:04:24] platform runs out of the building
[1:04:27] don't tell me the presence of God wasn't
[1:04:29] there friends it wasn't playing church
[1:04:30] that's the last thing it was and too
[1:04:33] many of them come into that and the
[1:04:35] prophet would warn them don't come up
[1:04:36] here if you've got hidden sin in your
[1:04:38] life I'm not responsible see and so when
[1:04:42] a when a when a when a small stature man
[1:04:44] walks out to 20 or 30,000 people and
[1:04:47] reaches a point and says now I take
[1:04:50] every spirit in here under my control
[1:04:53] for the glory of God that was no joke
[1:04:55] that was
[1:04:57] serious people died in the presence of
[1:05:01] God for defying
[1:05:03] that and so we we find that there was no
[1:05:06] case too hard because the angel had told
[1:05:08] him nothing will stand in front of your
[1:05:10] prayers not even cancer not anything all
[1:05:13] you have to do is get the people to
[1:05:14] believe
[1:05:15] you so you know and so I mean you know
[1:05:20] now here we are as I said I could go on
[1:05:22] with that all night I'm just preaching
[1:05:24] to the choir
[1:05:26] but now let's let's let's jump forward
[1:05:30] because here we are and we've been
[1:05:33] living under the reality of these deep
[1:05:36] Revelations for 60 years
[1:05:39] amen let's confront it let's not hide
[1:05:43] from it let's just take that on here
[1:05:46] we've been here 60
[1:05:48] years and you know we we thought that I
[1:05:51] I remember growing up as a young man and
[1:05:54] and as a young minister and you know
[1:05:56] through the 80s and and through the 90s
[1:05:58] and I'll just tell you that we we
[1:06:00] thought universally that Revelation
[1:06:02] alone would take us all the
[1:06:04] way and we had tremendous Revelation and
[1:06:08] things began to break to to some of our
[1:06:10] senior ministers some of them who aren't
[1:06:12] even with us anymore and some a few
[1:06:14] still are and tremendous
[1:06:17] breathtaking just things that were too
[1:06:20] too wonderful for us to almost to take
[1:06:22] in and I've been in meetings you know
[1:06:24] where a couple thousand people are just
[1:06:26] swaying just back and forth nobody can
[1:06:29] believe it and there's pandemonium just
[1:06:31] at the revelations that are coming
[1:06:36] forward we thought Revelation would take
[1:06:38] us all the
[1:06:40] way but God's plan for his last
[1:06:44] days was that there would be more for us
[1:06:49] to overcome than we
[1:06:51] thought I'm going to say this there
[1:06:53] would be more for us to overcome than
[1:06:55] even I believe the messenger
[1:06:57] thought because he flatly looked forward
[1:07:00] and everything went so dark after 77 and
[1:07:04] they asked him why did you pick 77 he
[1:07:06] said because I thought nobody could
[1:07:08] survive it would get so dark after 77 it
[1:07:12] just went totally black that was what
[1:07:14] the Bible said would happen Darkness
[1:07:16] would cover the Earth and a gross
[1:07:17] Darkness would cover the people and now
[1:07:20] here you are 87 997 2007 2017 and you're
[1:07:25] moving toward
[1:07:27] 2027 say how much worse can it get it's
[1:07:30] 10 times worse than I thought it could
[1:07:32] be 5 years
[1:07:35] ago but this was this was God's plan I'm
[1:07:39] going to tell you why I believe friends
[1:07:42] is that we had to have the other side of
[1:07:46] great Revelations that were coming out
[1:07:48] of the opening of the seals I mean it
[1:07:50] wasn't just Revelation in the seals it
[1:07:53] wasn't just that we were understanding
[1:07:54] who we were it wasn't just understanding
[1:07:56] who the Antichrist was but but this was
[1:07:59] the same Angel who had control of the
[1:08:02] seventh vial he's the very same one that
[1:08:04] showed John the holy city the bride he's
[1:08:07] the very same one that John kept trying
[1:08:09] to worship Him thought he was Christ and
[1:08:11] he kept having to stop him and he throws
[1:08:13] a rock up in the air and thus sayith the
[1:08:16] Lord judgment to striking the west coast
[1:08:17] and it did and he said now from this
[1:08:20] point the judgments will just get worse
[1:08:22] and worse and worse and worse there
[1:08:25] there be no peace till Jesus comes it
[1:08:27] doesn't matter what they do put an
[1:08:29] Abraham Lincoln and a George Washington
[1:08:31] in every County you won't turn it around
[1:08:33] the world is going completely
[1:08:39] insane so now we've got exploding
[1:08:42] Revelation we've got simultaneous
[1:08:45] judgments that are being poured out but
[1:08:47] I'm here to tell you I believe that we
[1:08:49] had to experience the darker side of
[1:08:52] these manifestations amen far
[1:08:56] worse than we even thought possible and
[1:09:00] I say that as a man approaching my Elder
[1:09:03] years hard for me to imagine don't know
[1:09:05] how I got here I was only 25 three weeks
[1:09:09] ago that you were not well that's how I
[1:09:13] feel and you know you all heard sister
[1:09:16] Jean give her testimony here and here
[1:09:19] she is
[1:09:20] b84 in December and she was you were
[1:09:23] giving your testimony sister mom you
[1:09:25] were like 22 or 22 year old young woman
[1:09:28] in those meetings uh but here she is
[1:09:31] still a
[1:09:32] Believer amen I don't witness to
[1:09:38] anybody oh
[1:09:41] my is this
[1:09:44] okay I'm just pouring the heart out of a
[1:09:46] man aging here you know I once was young
[1:09:49] and now I see my my years coming on and
[1:09:52] I'm here to tell you by experience none
[1:09:54] of us thought we' be here amen none of
[1:09:57] us did I can tell you I sat in those
[1:10:00] message me in those Minister meetings
[1:10:02] and sat and talked hours and hours to
[1:10:04] some of our great leaders who are gone
[1:10:06] on men who I sat at their feet and
[1:10:08] learned the Bible from and none of us
[1:10:11] thought there's no way it's impossible
[1:10:13] and and here we are friends oh my uh but
[1:10:17] but but I want to I want to say that the
[1:10:19] things we see although in the world
[1:10:21] today although they're they've reached
[1:10:23] unimaginable levels and we and we know
[1:10:26] that's true I mean even you don't need
[1:10:29] my perspective for that if if you've
[1:10:31] been alive here if you were if you're 20
[1:10:34] you can remember 10 and the world then
[1:10:36] to now is way
[1:10:39] different just in a decade it's been
[1:10:41] unimaginable the pace of degradation and
[1:10:45] things that the bride in this age would
[1:10:47] have to waigh through we've talked about
[1:10:50] it many times how that this is the only
[1:10:52] age that ever had to face the double
[1:10:55] whammy of the days of Noah and the days
[1:10:58] of
[1:10:59] lot
[1:11:01] combined ages dealt with that
[1:11:04] individually but we deal with it
[1:11:06] combined and it just so happens as if
[1:11:09] that's not bad enough where gee let me
[1:11:12] think how bad is it well every man's
[1:11:15] mind was evil continually around the
[1:11:18] entire
[1:11:20] planet the the spirit of perversion so
[1:11:23] bad they even wanted to to uh to to
[1:11:27] defame
[1:11:29] Angels no fear of anything of God of
[1:11:33] anything of of Holiness and
[1:11:36] righteousness that you're talking about
[1:11:38] a sick world and that's where we live
[1:11:40] now I know we swim around and it's like
[1:11:42] the Frog being boiled being slowly
[1:11:44] boiled to death we just say well it's
[1:11:46] just life it's not it's not life like
[1:11:48] God ever intended and now as if those
[1:11:51] things aren't bad enough Satan has now
[1:11:53] been voted in as the god of the age
[1:11:56] and now it's Satan's Eden he's had 6,000
[1:12:01] years s him conditioned to its fullness
[1:12:04] not just in a local city that got nuked
[1:12:06] later but now
[1:12:09] globally a whole world as the days of
[1:12:12] Noah not only not only willing but as
[1:12:16] the Bible says and dare I say with the
[1:12:18] scripture they're not only willing to be
[1:12:21] ungodly but they're
[1:12:23] eager to be ungodly
[1:12:26] and they will support and prop up anyone
[1:12:30] who will be ungodly with
[1:12:33] them there's nothing you see on the
[1:12:35] streets today that's not prophesied
[1:12:37] right here that it would be exactly like
[1:12:40] that the the part that we never imagined
[1:12:43] is it would be this bad and we'd still
[1:12:46] be
[1:12:47] here see am my no wonder you know the
[1:12:52] the the perversion has so bad now that
[1:12:55] the insanity has reached a level it I
[1:12:58] mean it flies into the very face of
[1:13:00] nature
[1:13:01] itself and you know I I was saying to to
[1:13:05] Green Pond assembly over there I said my
[1:13:08] they say you know they said during the
[1:13:10] pandemic you need to believe the science
[1:13:12] well I okay fine I wish you'd believe
[1:13:14] the
[1:13:15] science on gender
[1:13:18] identity how about you believe the
[1:13:20] science I I would say follow the
[1:13:23] science science tells you that's
[1:13:25] nonsense it's
[1:13:27] impossible oh but nobody wants to follow
[1:13:29] the science unless it's convenient to
[1:13:30] their political ideology Insanity
[1:13:33] friends the whole world is insane don't
[1:13:36] chase that thing young people don't
[1:13:38] chase it it's it's burning it's going to
[1:13:41] Ash and Cinder and there's a bride
[1:13:43] getting ready to leave
[1:13:46] here they create issues in education
[1:13:49] issues in politics issues in society at
[1:13:52] large issues for which there are no
[1:13:57] Solutions no wonder the world has become
[1:14:00] so polarized both sides shouting neither
[1:14:04] side listening my the and and the and
[1:14:07] and the right just as bad as the left
[1:14:11] yes Hallelujah need everybody need to
[1:14:13] say Amen to that different beliefs same
[1:14:17] evil different actions same devil
[1:14:19] controlling both
[1:14:22] sides not hating on the world world I'm
[1:14:26] just declaring there's this is real this
[1:14:28] is happening in real
[1:14:32] time and and brother brandham knew that
[1:14:35] that we could be in this for the long
[1:14:37] hul but man nobody wanted to think
[1:14:40] that I can tell you nobody wanted to
[1:14:44] think that brother brandham talked about
[1:14:45] that it might not be for another 100
[1:14:47] years it might not be for another 50
[1:14:48] years it might not be you know I said I
[1:14:50] don't know when he's coming and he talks
[1:14:52] about California and and and and I'm and
[1:14:54] I'm I'm here to tell you something
[1:14:55] friends I I just seen a quote refreshed
[1:14:58] to my mind the other day that it's it
[1:15:01] was not said thus sayith the Lord it
[1:15:03] absolutely was not and there's not a
[1:15:05] quote where he said it as thus sayith
[1:15:06] the Lord but he did offer an opinion
[1:15:09] that he he thought the bride would see
[1:15:11] California
[1:15:13] go he thought we would that would happen
[1:15:16] before the bride goes home that's on
[1:15:18] tape I'm here to tell you something
[1:15:20] friends one of these mornings you might
[1:15:21] just wake up and there's a news flash
[1:15:23] and there's something that's happened
[1:15:24] and nobody body knows what's going on
[1:15:26] and as the day progresses the nightmare
[1:15:28] of reality is going to begin to strike
[1:15:31] we've lost hundreds of miles of our
[1:15:33] Western Seaboard and millions are
[1:15:36] dead I I you know there's a lot said and
[1:15:39] I'm I'm I'm working on it right now I
[1:15:41] don't have it ready to present but that
[1:15:44] that's one of the helpful things that
[1:15:47] has come from artificial intelligence uh
[1:15:50] generative I should say ai's been in use
[1:15:53] for 20 years I mean back in the day when
[1:15:56] you were using word and little clippy
[1:15:58] guy remember him look like a little
[1:15:59] paperclip I mean that was AI you know
[1:16:01] word correct in your grammar we've had
[1:16:04] that but generative AI where where where
[1:16:06] it can now you know uh understand
[1:16:09] context and I always had a question in
[1:16:11] my mind you remember y'all remember me
[1:16:13] telling you the story where I had a
[1:16:15] question about the New Jerusalem and the
[1:16:16] city and the mountain and how big and I
[1:16:18] went to a college and talked to a
[1:16:20] professor there and got the whole
[1:16:21] breakdown I preached on that and and
[1:16:24] I've had a I've had had a a question
[1:16:25] about but I didn't know who there was no
[1:16:28] one person you could ask you would need
[1:16:31] you would need a a a whole team of
[1:16:33] experts you would need Economist and
[1:16:36] geologist and and and political
[1:16:38] scientist and and and you'd need you
[1:16:40] know because I'm trying to answer the
[1:16:42] question what would be the
[1:16:45] Fallout politically you know as far as
[1:16:49] geology is concerned the Earth loss of
[1:16:52] life Financial
[1:16:55] social political what would happen if if
[1:16:58] our if the United States would
[1:17:01] suddenly in a moment with no time to
[1:17:04] prepare or evacuate lose a piece of its
[1:17:07] land mass 1,500 miles long start at San
[1:17:12] Diego and go north you don't I mean
[1:17:14] you're finally going to run out of
[1:17:16] California 350 miles wide back to the
[1:17:19] salt and sea look on the map do you can
[1:17:22] do it yourself when there's 20 million
[1:17:25] people living just in the San Fernando
[1:17:27] Valley by
[1:17:29] itself and how would you project the
[1:17:32] loss of life the tsunamis the the
[1:17:35] geological impact the the the the Earth
[1:17:38] you know what would even happen to the
[1:17:40] gravitational polls what would happen
[1:17:42] politically financially the the banking
[1:17:44] industry Silicon Valley the insurance
[1:17:46] industry our our Western Seaboard
[1:17:49] military
[1:17:51] defense who would you ask and I've
[1:17:53] always thought who could I'd have to I'd
[1:17:55] have to go to a university and just go
[1:17:57] down and and talk to every professor and
[1:17:58] try to coate it all and but now I I and
[1:18:01] so the other day I've been doing some
[1:18:03] research using artificial intelligence
[1:18:05] it it projected it and it's alarming oh
[1:18:08] yes amen it'll take your breath
[1:18:10] away and it I can just tell you this the
[1:18:13] world has no clue they're not prepared
[1:18:17] for what's
[1:18:19] coming Hallelujah but I believe I know
[1:18:21] that a prophet said that the the of
[1:18:25] Matthew 27 and 28 repeat at the end time
[1:18:28] and I know in 27 and 28 there was two
[1:18:30] earthquakes one on Good Friday and that
[1:18:33] one's already happened and there was
[1:18:35] already a crucifixion of the word and an
[1:18:38] indictment of the age and the next
[1:18:40] earthquake was Resurrection morning
[1:18:42] hallelujah hallelujah and the the the
[1:18:45] graves and the bodies which slept a
[1:18:48] rose Hallelujah and we're seen of many
[1:18:52] oh could it be friends oh I going tell
[1:18:54] you something something if you get up
[1:18:55] and you hear some kind of report just
[1:18:57] start getting ready to see those loved
[1:18:59] ones Hallelujah they're going to turn
[1:19:02] around and there they're going to be and
[1:19:03] we're going
[1:19:04] [Music]
[1:19:06] home that's
[1:19:08] happening that's happening in your life
[1:19:10] time
[1:19:12] hallu in my
[1:19:17] lifetime we saw how the and and when I
[1:19:21] look at 60 years then I say then it's
[1:19:23] fitting
[1:19:25] because I can see how that the bride has
[1:19:27] moved up the pyramid in her growth of
[1:19:30] and maturity from the foundation of
[1:19:32] faith in the first age all the way up to
[1:19:34] the Capstone realization and all of
[1:19:37] those characteristics of the new birth
[1:19:40] they had to be experienced in Satan's
[1:19:43] Eden God has going to have to prove this
[1:19:45] thing he's not going to prove it when
[1:19:48] we're on the other side he's going to
[1:19:50] shake it in the devil's face but the
[1:19:52] proof is being done right here right now
[1:19:55] that the word has the power to keep a
[1:19:58] bride pure and
[1:20:01] clean and renouncing the things of the
[1:20:04] world voluntarily renouncing
[1:20:09] them they had to be proven true that we
[1:20:13] may prove As Romans 2 or 122 says that
[1:20:19] we may that you may prove what is that
[1:20:21] good and acceptable and perfect will of
[1:20:26] God you see the the ministry of Elijah
[1:20:30] was not merely proven
[1:20:33] theologically though that's a you can
[1:20:34] make a really good
[1:20:36] case and fact is it's so good that's the
[1:20:39] one no one will will take my Challenge
[1:20:42] on they want to argue and and attack a
[1:20:45] dead man's personal life but none of
[1:20:47] them will come and say as I've
[1:20:49] challenged around the world and say
[1:20:51] bring your Bible let's talk about the
[1:20:53] doctrines
[1:20:56] I can I can prove What We Believe by the
[1:20:59] scriptures and and and I can tell you
[1:21:01] the proof is so Ironclad that it really
[1:21:04] relegates trying to resist it is just
[1:21:06] shooting blanks like brother Ernie used
[1:21:08] to say they're shooting blanks man you
[1:21:11] got laser guided weapons that don't miss
[1:21:15] Hallelujah the ministry of Elijah was
[1:21:18] not just proven theologically it was
[1:21:20] proven
[1:21:22] experientially people witnessed it by
[1:21:24] the tens of thousands you know a a a a
[1:21:27] man walked in that Ministry and 33 years
[1:21:31] of ministry around the world seven times
[1:21:33] and produced the promises that were
[1:21:36] foretold had been
[1:21:38] foretold what the Holy Ghost was
[1:21:41] supposed to
[1:21:42] be what Hebrews 13:8 meant everybody
[1:21:45] knew what it said that Jesus Christ
[1:21:48] would be the same yesterday today and
[1:21:49] forever and they resisted that they went
[1:21:52] from either not understanding it to
[1:21:54] outright denials it didn't matter a
[1:21:56] Kentucky hillbilly went seven times
[1:21:58] around the world and proved that was
[1:22:00] true and Christ was always faithful to
[1:22:04] him to prove it I'm here to tell you
[1:22:05] something Friends The Omega bride the
[1:22:08] final voice to this final age you've got
[1:22:10] to prove those promises
[1:22:14] also I mean just like the alpha
[1:22:17] bride listen the alpha bride had to
[1:22:20] prove what Ezekiel had said the Holy
[1:22:23] Ghost would be
[1:22:25] yeah he said that he he would Pi take
[1:22:27] you up out of water sprinkle clean water
[1:22:29] upon you he give you a new spirit and
[1:22:31] then he'd give you his spirit and it
[1:22:33] would cause you to keep his Commandments
[1:22:35] that Alpha church had to prove that was
[1:22:37] true they said Peter you are a bunch of
[1:22:39] drunk people said no you misunderstand
[1:22:41] we're not drunk this is what Joel said
[1:22:44] they had to prove that you understand
[1:22:46] they had to prove what Isaiah had said
[1:22:48] they had to prove what all those
[1:22:50] prophets had said the Holy Ghost would
[1:22:52] be when it came in and took a heart of F
[1:22:55] A Heart of Stone and gave you a heart of
[1:22:57] Flesh and and God would dwell in the
[1:23:00] midst of his people and they walked
[1:23:02] that's why and you've heard me say the
[1:23:04] book of Acts was written because people
[1:23:08] acted they heard they recognized and
[1:23:11] they acted upon the word of God I'm here
[1:23:13] to tell you there's prophecies
[1:23:15] concerning this end time bride and
[1:23:17] you're going to prove it you're going to
[1:23:19] prove that you're not like that woman
[1:23:21] that for forsook the world and committed
[1:23:23] adultery against Christ you're not like
[1:23:25] Israel when they did that you're not
[1:23:27] like NAIA when they did that this bride
[1:23:31] is predestinated to not
[1:23:33] fall Hallelujah and she's marching to
[1:23:36] Zion beautiful beautiful
[1:23:40] Zion Oh
[1:23:42] My they proved everything the Old
[1:23:45] Testament said would be when God lived
[1:23:48] in the heart they proved exactly what
[1:23:50] Jesus said it would be when he and the
[1:23:53] father DW dwelt together in his kingdom
[1:23:57] in his people and the bride has to do
[1:24:00] the same thing she had to do the same
[1:24:02] thing in every age she had to everything
[1:24:05] that John had written about those
[1:24:07] characteristics in the Book of
[1:24:09] Revelation that that bride of that day
[1:24:12] it's it whether they knew it or not
[1:24:15] because it was sealed away to them they
[1:24:17] were actually walking in perfect
[1:24:20] fulfillment of scripture not even
[1:24:22] knowing that they needed to try
[1:24:25] yeah amen amen and here you are with the
[1:24:29] seals taken off of the book and the
[1:24:31] whole plan and now you not only try it's
[1:24:34] become your whole entire desire you have
[1:24:37] risen to a place now where you see who
[1:24:39] he is and you see who you are and you
[1:24:42] see what the plan is and you say my
[1:24:44] goodness yeah it's been 60 years no
[1:24:46] wonder because there had to be somebody
[1:24:48] to prove this thing and I'm so glad to
[1:24:50] be one of those Witnesses I'm so glad
[1:24:53] that I can give my life in dedication
[1:24:56] and prove what the word has said see cuz
[1:25:01] we've arrived at that time we've arrived
[1:25:03] at the time that the climaxes of all the
[1:25:07] ages the acts of the Holy Ghost for
[1:25:10] 2,000
[1:25:12] years we've arrived at a time when the
[1:25:15] former and latter rains now are to be
[1:25:17] poured out close together in the same
[1:25:19] month these these are all
[1:25:22] unprecedented these are all unique to
[1:25:25] our day see was not that there's only
[1:25:28] one place you find and that was a
[1:25:30] fulfillment left for the end time the
[1:25:32] former latter rain would Pour Out close
[1:25:34] together in the same month that was a
[1:25:37] prophecy at the end time along with I'll
[1:25:39] I'll your sons and your daughters shall
[1:25:41] prophesy your old men shall see see
[1:25:43] dreams all of these prophecies go
[1:25:45] together for what the bride would be
[1:25:46] over 2,000 years and at the end time
[1:25:49] she'd come to a climax she'd come back
[1:25:51] to the original and just like the
[1:25:53] original proved the Old Testament at the
[1:25:55] end time we're here to prove everything
[1:25:57] in the New Testament we're here to prove
[1:25:59] that what Paul said is true I can prove
[1:26:02] what is that good and acceptable and
[1:26:05] holy thing of God it's one thing to say
[1:26:08] I proved it when there's no contrast you
[1:26:10] live in the most contrasting age between
[1:26:13] good and evil that's ever
[1:26:15] existed you're living in Gross Darkness
[1:26:18] but yet you're still a
[1:26:20] Believer Hallelujah and I'm not afraid I
[1:26:23] have courage and I'm ready to stand and
[1:26:25] I'm ready to go
[1:26:27] forward
[1:26:29] Hallelujah a bride marching to the
[1:26:32] rhythm of the
[1:26:33] word the world and the modern Church of
[1:26:36] Leota being led by a
[1:26:41] witch marching to worldly music and
[1:26:43] worldly
[1:26:45] entertainments and all of them headed
[1:26:47] toward the
[1:26:48] abyss all of them Prophet said the most
[1:26:51] awful screams you ever heard
[1:26:54] was when they just started they were
[1:26:56] marching and they just started going off
[1:26:58] the edge and just plunging into the
[1:27:02] abyss you would think they'd went
[1:27:07] whoa but when you're blind you don't
[1:27:10] know that's the
[1:27:12] abyss you're under a trance you're under
[1:27:16] a spell it's a spell of Witchcraft it's
[1:27:20] a it's it's a false prophet that has
[1:27:23] that brother said what made him a false
[1:27:25] prophet is that he taught false
[1:27:28] teaching and so when you when you look
[1:27:30] at the concepts of how brother Brandon
[1:27:32] brought it and this is why brother
[1:27:34] Lonnie used to always show it this way
[1:27:36] so it's so beautiful I don't have time
[1:27:37] to preach on it tonight but but but
[1:27:40] literally how are people going to end up
[1:27:43] in a
[1:27:44] tribulation when it's so clear how to
[1:27:47] avoid
[1:27:48] it I mean it's in such black and white
[1:27:51] and it's so plain and and it gives you
[1:27:54] the road map it's like it's like taking
[1:27:56] the ultimate test and you've got the
[1:27:58] cheat
[1:27:59] codes and he's given the whole world
[1:28:01] here's how you avoid it here's what you
[1:28:03] don't do and they all go and do exactly
[1:28:06] what they're not supposed to do say how
[1:28:08] in the world can the insanity get and a
[1:28:10] prophet taught us that that false
[1:28:12] prophet preaches them right into
[1:28:16] iten preach you see you see why seeds of
[1:28:22] discrepancy are so
[1:28:25] deadly you see why a a human doubt in
[1:28:29] the slightest bit against God's revealed
[1:28:32] word and proven and Vindicated word is
[1:28:35] so
[1:28:36] dangerous you see why he had to send a
[1:28:38] Prophet this thing had to be Razor's
[1:28:41] Edge this thing had to be thus sayeth
[1:28:44] the Lord and so much so that if even the
[1:28:47] messenger slipped and made a mistake the
[1:28:49] Holy Spirit would stop him Mak him back
[1:28:50] up and fix it Hallelujah
[1:28:54] oh I'm so glad he had enough humility to
[1:28:56] do it oh I'm so glad he had enough
[1:28:59] humility to to admit that he had ups and
[1:29:01] downs and fers and fals and that's why I
[1:29:03] admit it and that's why we admit it and
[1:29:05] that's why we say we're all in this
[1:29:06] thing together Hallelujah but I but I'm
[1:29:09] coming now by the mercies of
[1:29:12] God I'm presenting myself a Living
[1:29:15] Sacrifice I can't do it you can't do it
[1:29:17] but by the mercies of God I can do
[1:29:20] it
[1:29:22] hallelujah oh my
[1:29:24] I and here we are Marching and and even
[1:29:28] the bride got out of step and a prophet
[1:29:33] said if you wanna if you want to know
[1:29:35] listen friends if you want to
[1:29:38] know why sometimes and I'm not a prophet
[1:29:41] but I'm about to expose you to yourself
[1:29:43] because you're going to know what I'm
[1:29:44] about to say don't anybody raise their
[1:29:47] hand we don't need you to
[1:29:48] confess I'm not going to confess my
[1:29:51] faults and failures to you I'm just
[1:29:52] going to say pray for me because I got
[1:29:53] them
[1:29:55] amen
[1:29:57] amen but but but we realize that that
[1:30:00] the that the bride kind of got out of
[1:30:02] step and people wonder why I can't live
[1:30:06] a more Victorious life because you got
[1:30:09] out of Step well okay but how did that
[1:30:11] happen I'm glad you asked a prophet said
[1:30:14] she though that bride at the end time
[1:30:16] that one at the very end she got out of
[1:30:19] Step by watching that other
[1:30:22] group paying too much attention to
[1:30:25] worldly uh
[1:30:27] stuff worldly yeah worldly
[1:30:31] anything oh my get it out of your life
[1:30:35] get it out of your home get it away from
[1:30:37] you turn your whole life look toward the
[1:30:40] Christ look toward the Holy Spirit and
[1:30:42] say Lord let me this day Avail myself of
[1:30:45] your mercies that I might walk
[1:30:48] through that I might forsake the
[1:30:50] nonsense of the world and that's why
[1:30:52] Prophet was screaming he said when I
[1:30:54] when I came out of the vision I was
[1:30:55] standing in the middle of the room with
[1:30:56] my arms out saying get back in line now
[1:31:00] the now you say that's Dreadful no
[1:31:01] there's actually a little beautiful
[1:31:03] thing that he he just dropped in there
[1:31:04] right before he comes to that that's
[1:31:06] just the ending but brother Brandon
[1:31:08] before before that happened moments
[1:31:10] before that happened he said I noticed
[1:31:13] that instead of going down like they
[1:31:15] went down he said instead of going down
[1:31:17] she started going
[1:31:18] up that's while she was stumbling that's
[1:31:22] While She Was Out a step she was still
[1:31:25] going
[1:31:27] up
[1:31:29] Hallelujah the mercies of God are upon
[1:31:33] us friends and the promise of the word
[1:31:35] is for you and there's not enough devils
[1:31:37] in hell to stop
[1:31:40] that say oh then that gives me Freedom
[1:31:43] uh to sin it doesn't give me that it
[1:31:46] gives me a contrite heart it breaks my
[1:31:49] heart and say Lord God oh let me get
[1:31:51] back in Step I'm so glad to know I'm
[1:31:53] going up but I want to earn it I want to
[1:31:56] know that I that I'm in that I'm in the
[1:31:58] game I want to know that my life is
[1:32:00] counting for
[1:32:01] something hallelujah what about it bethl
[1:32:05] Tabernacle is that where you are in your
[1:32:07] heart
[1:32:12] tonight you don't a lot of times we
[1:32:15] don't understand
[1:32:17] and sometimes we have a hard
[1:32:21] time understanding you know
[1:32:25] something let me just say it like this
[1:32:27] you there's no way okay this is here's a
[1:32:30] good way to say it you'll get it you

[1:32:37] get an understanding of of anything be
[1:32:41] it a Doctrine be it anything that's a
[1:32:44] benefit to your to your understanding
[1:32:47] there's no better teacher than
[1:32:51] experience there's no way to get
[1:32:53] yourself psyche around it better than by
[1:32:57] experience so yeah a prophet came and
[1:33:00] opened the seals and was wonderful
[1:33:01] Revelations and for 60 years and we
[1:33:03] thought that would get us home it never
[1:33:05] was going to get us home because it
[1:33:07] wasn't just here that we had to
[1:33:10] understand it it was here we had to live
[1:33:13] it Jesus had to live it Paul had to live
[1:33:17] it the disciples had to live it Luther
[1:33:19] had to live it the Pentecostal fathers
[1:33:22] had to live it who wants to live
[1:33:24] it yes I'd like to have been gone 60
[1:33:27] years ago but when I get there I'll be
[1:33:29] more valuable I'll know how to rule and
[1:33:32] reign with Christ A Thousand
[1:33:34] Years see we didn't want that to be true
[1:33:39] but if we're going to reign with Christ
[1:33:41] in the world to come the tutor knew yes
[1:33:46] he knew we would need
[1:33:49] experience the work of the spirit you
[1:33:51] see wasn't really finished when you got
[1:33:53] born again a lot of people think it is
[1:33:55] you're just getting
[1:33:59] started say man the
[1:34:02] uh the people who come in on the on on
[1:34:06] the last day well they're going to be
[1:34:08] awfully
[1:34:09] lucky yeah tell that to the thief on the
[1:34:12] cross and see if you get that kind of an
[1:34:18] answer see when when when we think about
[1:34:21] the work of the spirit not being
[1:34:23] finished finished how that he's got to
[1:34:25] continue to work in our lives you know
[1:34:27] the the new birth you know he's when you
[1:34:30] get born again then then the holy spirit
[1:34:34] is just in the right position to start
[1:34:36] leading you and guiding
[1:34:38] you I mean you're you say well he you
[1:34:40] mean he can't lead me and guide me
[1:34:41] before I get born again he could but you
[1:34:43] won't
[1:34:44] listen Paul said your mind is enmity
[1:34:47] against God it would never agree with
[1:34:48] God's word why do you think you're a
[1:34:51] sinner why do you think you did things
[1:34:53] that destroyed your life were you crazy
[1:34:56] were you stupid no were you ignorant no
[1:34:59] uh you you lived a sinful life that was
[1:35:01] sending you to an early grave and you
[1:35:03] did it in in a high
[1:35:05] gear see so your your mind would was is
[1:35:09] not geared to think and agree with the
[1:35:10] word of God that's what the Holy Ghost
[1:35:12] is given for that you may be not
[1:35:15] transformed that you that you may be not
[1:35:17] conformed to this world but be
[1:35:19] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[1:35:23] so that that you may prove what is that
[1:35:25] good what is that Holy what is that
[1:35:27] acceptable will of God so you need to
[1:35:30] have the
[1:35:32] experience listen friends the truth
[1:35:35] shall make you free but there's no
[1:35:39] there's no level there's no there's no
[1:35:42] power so much so in truth as when you
[1:35:46] experience truth as when you prove it as
[1:35:50] when the Devil comes and brings
[1:35:52] something to take you aside and you say
[1:35:54] I will not do that I I've been given
[1:35:58] power to loose and power to bind and I
[1:36:01] bind that devil and I cast down vain
[1:36:03] imaginations and I put my eyes on
[1:36:05] Calvary and I'm going forward I'm here
[1:36:08] to tell you you're growing in faith
[1:36:10] muscles at that
[1:36:12] time see it actually it actually makes
[1:36:15] you free
[1:36:16] listen it actually makes you
[1:36:20] free when you if we walk in the
[1:36:26] light you see it actually footsteps mean
[1:36:30] possession so Freedom Is In Action
[1:36:34] hearing recognizing and acting if we
[1:36:38] walk in the light as he is in the light
[1:36:41] you get
[1:36:42] me all right I gotta wind down
[1:36:50] here last point I want to make for
[1:36:52] tonight
[1:36:55] we've
[1:36:58] been preaching on the East
[1:37:01] Wind the judgment's
[1:37:03] coming in the East
[1:37:07] Wind tonight is part
[1:37:10] 13 Sunday the Lord willing will be part
[1:37:14] 14 of the
[1:37:16] voice in the East Wind Brad I see you
[1:37:19] shaking your head
[1:37:21] doubting U let me just say my my plan is
[1:37:25] 14 will be
[1:37:28] it
[1:37:30] amen and the theme has been the same all
[1:37:33] along how was it Pharaoh didn't hear the
[1:37:35] voice in the East
[1:37:37] Wind after seven times in a row you
[1:37:40] would think he would have got it listen
[1:37:43] friends not only did he not get it by by
[1:37:46] the seventh one or the eighth one or the
[1:37:49] ninth one even the 10th one the Locust
[1:37:53] were only only near the top I think they
[1:37:55] were the eighth plague seventh or eighth
[1:37:57] plague was the yeah the eighth plague
[1:37:59] was the Locust that came in on the East
[1:38:01] Wind and you'd think okay well the
[1:38:04] dingdong surely he'd get it now he
[1:38:05] didn't and then the ninth one came and
[1:38:08] well now I know he'll get it he didn't
[1:38:11] okay well the 10th one's going to take
[1:38:12] out the first born there's there's no
[1:38:15] there's no question and and Pharaoh not
[1:38:19] only not only did he not believe that
[1:38:21] there would come another plague he
[1:38:23] actually played a part in deciding what
[1:38:26] the plague would be by threatening Moses
[1:38:29] in the way he did Pharaoh decided his
[1:38:31] own fate that's the insanity of Egypt
[1:38:34] when Israel went in an exodus and here
[1:38:37] you are in a Third Exodus Hallelujah and
[1:38:40] the whole world you say why are they so
[1:38:41] crazy cuz they've decided to be why are
[1:38:44] they so Godless cuz they've decided to
[1:38:46] be why is it Satan's eeden because
[1:38:48] that's what they want that's brother
[1:38:50] Adam said that's what you want that's
[1:38:52] what God gave you now what you going to
[1:38:54] do with it I'm here to tell you I'm so
[1:38:56] glad I chose the right way I'm so glad I
[1:38:58] chose the word of this hour I'm so glad
[1:39:01] I know like job that my redeemer liveth
[1:39:04] and it's proven to be so he's coming to
[1:39:07] judge sin and righteousness in this last
[1:39:11] age the world is oblivious we scream it
[1:39:15] we put it on the internet we do
[1:39:16] everything we can we hold meetings we
[1:39:18] invite people we tell our neighbors
[1:39:20] we're Witnesses on the job was driving
[1:39:23] down the street coming to church and
[1:39:26] here's a woman perfectly innocent woman
[1:39:28] probably a very nice person she seemed
[1:39:30] to have a very nice demeanor as we went
[1:39:32] by and she's got on you know her jogging
[1:39:34] outfit and it's like jogging pants and
[1:39:37] uh and and and a shirt and her headband
[1:39:39] and she's jogging away and I just
[1:39:41] thought poor lady does not
[1:39:43] know what even chance does she has have
[1:39:46] to know that if a woman puts on a
[1:39:50] garment that pertains to a man it's an
[1:39:52] Abomination to God
[1:39:54] and I thought I felt sorry for her I
[1:39:56] thought man should I pull over and tell
[1:39:57] her I don't even know if she'd believe
[1:39:59] me if I did you know why because all the
[1:40:02] preachers she's ever had probably told
[1:40:04] her it wasn't
[1:40:05] necessary and she may have never even
[1:40:08] read that in the Bible she may have
[1:40:09] never even read a Bible and that's not
[1:40:12] one person that one person is indicative
[1:40:14] of
[1:40:15] 99.9% of humanity in the world in spite
[1:40:19] of all the meetings and all the prophets
[1:40:21] and all the all the great Ministries and
[1:40:23] all the Supernatural and here we are uh
[1:40:26] with sending the gospel around the world
[1:40:27] and we're on the internet we're in
[1:40:29] church and we got podcast and we got
[1:40:31] everything going and the world they they
[1:40:33] have chosen their path and they're it's
[1:40:36] steadfast they're happy in it and I feel
[1:40:38] sorry for him but I have also chosen my
[1:40:41] path I have also made my choice I have
[1:40:44] also decided to apply a token I have
[1:40:47] decided to believe every word of
[1:40:50] God hallelujah friends so you know when
[1:40:54] I say I know the judgments are coming
[1:40:56] but listen listen as I as I go off the
[1:40:58] air here listen the remember in the
[1:41:00] scripture you've heard me teach on this
[1:41:02] before how that how that Paul said we
[1:41:05] shall all come before the Judgment seat
[1:41:08] of Christ and give an account of our
[1:41:11] Deeds whether good or bad now if you
[1:41:14] don't understand that verse it seems
[1:41:16] like a direct contradiction to the
[1:41:18] promise Jesus made that that if you've
[1:41:21] that if you've passed from Death To Life
[1:41:23] you'll never come into the Judgment then
[1:41:25] why does Paul say we shall all Al then
[1:41:29] you have to you have to realize that the
[1:41:31] Judgment seat of Christ is his
[1:41:34] word and so the Judgment seat is right
[1:41:37] here and so as I've said to you so many
[1:41:39] times the question is not will I stand
[1:41:41] before the Judgment seat or or the
[1:41:44] question is not will I the question is
[1:41:46] where will I and when will I and I don't
[1:41:50] want to go there then I'll take here
[1:41:54] now and the judgments of the East Wind
[1:41:57] are coming and he's coming to bring
[1:41:59] righteousness and judge sin and I just
[1:42:01] say Lord look in my life and Judge Me by
[1:42:04] your word I say bring on the East Wind
[1:42:08] let it judge my life let it judge your
[1:42:11] life I voluntarily stand before his
[1:42:14] judgment seat and I say bring it on Lord
[1:42:17] bring on the East Wind I know it's
[1:42:19] Wrecking the world but it's also
[1:42:21] perfecting a bride
[1:42:24] who is who has identified herself as the
[1:42:26] bride of Christ marching to Zion up the
[1:42:29] pyramid all the way to the Capstone
[1:42:32] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah friends

[1:42:42] building say I I want that judgment seat
[1:42:45] I want to stand before it right now I'm
[1:42:47] not afraid of the East Wind I know it's
[1:42:51] coming for
[1:42:54] years and it's only going to get
[1:42:58] worse but if the Judgment seat of
[1:43:03] God can do both either
[1:43:07] or it can either destroy me or it can
[1:43:11] perfect me amen I'm pretty sure you know
[1:43:15] which one I'm going to
