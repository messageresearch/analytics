[5:21] everyone let's stand and
[5:26] pray Heavenly Father we just come before
[5:28] you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[5:30] and we ask that your Holy Spirit would
[5:32] take control of every heart and every
[5:34] every thought Lord we want to bring
[5:37] every thought into captivity of The
[5:39] Obedience of Christ Lord guide and
[5:42] direct each one of us Lord fill us with
[5:44] the holy spirit and wisdom and
[5:47] understanding Lord that we would know
[5:49] the hour we're living in and and see
[5:52] that we're in the closing of time the
[5:54] end of the end Lord thank you thank you
[5:57] for this Revelation thank you for this
[5:59] understanding that you've given to us
[6:00] through a Vindicated Prophet we commit
[6:02] ourselves to you we ask in Jesus name
[6:05] amen all right part three continuing on
[6:08] about Israel God's time piece we'll read
[6:11] the
[6:12] scripture I mean the whole thing will be
[6:14] reading scripture so but we'll read a
[6:16] couple scriptures and then you can sit
[6:17] down Romans
[6:20] 10 veres 10 and 11 for with the heart
[6:23] man believeth unto righteousness and
[6:25] with the mouth confession is made unto
[6:27] salvation for the scripture saith who
[6:29] whoever believeth on him shall not be
[6:32] ashamed for there is no difference
[6:33] between the Jew and the Greek for the
[6:35] same Lord overall is Rich unto all that
[6:39] call upon him for whosoever shall call
[6:41] upon the name of the Lord shall be saved
[6:44] amen may the Lord add the blessing to
[6:45] the reading of his word you can be
[6:49] seated so this is uh in context we
[6:52] started at the beginning of chapter n
[6:55] looking back through uh nine 10 and
[7:00] we're going to go through 11 Lord
[7:02] willing we'll finish this time but who
[7:04] knows um we're looking at Israel brother
[7:08] Bram says if you want to know what time
[7:10] it is on God's calendar look at Israel
[7:13] amen and so you know we go back through
[7:17] time through the last 60 70 years and
[7:21] you know each time we could overreact
[7:22] and say it's got to be now of course in
[7:27] uh I wasn't around then but in the
[7:30] 6068 and 73
[7:33] and knowing what brother brandham said
[7:36] message Believers were like this this is
[7:38] it this is it and as I look at it I
[7:41] don't want to be the one to tell you
[7:42] this is not it because we're always to
[7:45] be anticipating but what I see is
[7:48] happening is things are being set in
[7:49] order for the tribulation period and
[7:52] we're not going to know the day or the
[7:54] hour that's right and so in principle we
[7:57] can't say oh it's going to be in the
[7:59] next 3 months 6 months this day this
[8:01] time um we know that it's
[8:04] soon which is a wonderful word soon it
[8:08] could mean
[8:10] anything but with that said is things
[8:12] are being set in order if we look in
[8:14] scripture we understand that behind the
[8:18] scenes the Roman Catholic Church is
[8:20] pulling strings through through
[8:23] different organizations whatever they
[8:25] might be whatever conspiracy theory you
[8:27] want to talk about that's going on the
[8:29] reality is we know from scripture that
[8:31] Rome is the one that's R ruling the
[8:34] world and pulling the strings from the
[8:37] Vatican and so you know regardless of
[8:41] how you want to look at that then
[8:42] secondarily we also know what brother
[8:43] Bram said that there's going to be a
[8:45] covenant between the
[8:47] Antichrist and the Jews and America
[8:51] remember the way he brings that together
[8:53] we'll look at that in more detail I'm
[8:55] just trying to set set sort of a scene
[8:58] as we go into this is
[9:00] is we have the true Jew who is the
[9:03] elected who is going to hear and receive
[9:07] the message of the two
[9:09] witnesses then you have what brother
[9:11] brandham calls the Wall Street
[9:13] Jew and that opens up a whole uh uh
[9:18] another topic to look into and look into
[9:21] history and the different ones and even
[9:23] the ones that were so uh adamant about
[9:26] uh reinstating the state of Israel were
[9:29] not
[9:29] Believers we're not looking for the
[9:33] scriptures to come to pass many of them
[9:35] were global banking Elite families the
[9:38] Ross Childs Etc these are those Wall
[9:41] Street Jews that brother bandam speaks
[9:46] about and again that is a a rabbit hole
[9:49] that I warn everyone about not jumping
[9:53] into because it goes It goes so deep and
[9:55] there's so much to it brother Brandon
[9:57] brought it out to us in a very simple
[9:59] way
[10:00] and if we know history of the last 70 80
[10:04] years 100 years we you could see those
[10:07] things exactly God will use even the
[10:09] worst atheist to bring his word to pass
[10:15] and that
[10:17] that's that's one of those families
[10:19] there amongst many of the the Jewish
[10:22] Wall Street Bankers that have sought
[10:25] control over the world and manipulation
[10:28] over the world working no doubt together
[10:31] with the Catholic Church behind the
[10:33] scenes so again we look at Jews and we
[10:37] see uh in our I'm saying this to get to
[10:40] our current climate that we have is you
[10:41] see many political commentators
[10:44] beginning to question why America stands
[10:48] with the nation of
[10:50] Israel and why why are why are they why
[10:54] are we spending so much money when we
[10:56] have our own problems in order to help
[11:00] and fund
[11:02] Israel and this is going to be the
[11:05] natural direction that things go because
[11:08] we know that all nations will stand
[11:10] against Israel and even many Christians
[11:13] are starting to say well this whole
[11:16] dispensational theology that views
[11:20] Israel as being restored is wrong the
[11:22] church actually
[11:23] replaces uh Israel and oh they have
[11:27] they'll bring you this scripture and
[11:28] this scripture but they're not going to
[11:30] bring you all of Romans 9:10 and
[11:32] 11 the in in one sense it the church
[11:36] replaces Israel in another sense neither
[11:38] replaces either if we look at God's
[11:41] economy and God's plan he had a he had a
[11:44] purpose of raising up Israel and he
[11:47] still has not accomplished that purpose
[11:49] so unless we think that God is going to
[11:51] fail and not bring his word to pass then
[11:54] there has to be a restoration of Israel
[11:57] there has to be a King set upon the
[12:01] throne to rule over that nation and rule
[12:04] over all the nations from
[12:06] Jerusalem God hasn't forgotten that God
[12:09] hasn't replaced heaven with Jerusalem
[12:12] and now Jesus this is the
[12:14] post-millennial Jesus is ruling the
[12:16] Earth through his church the
[12:19] post-millennial and the amillennial view
[12:21] that brother brandham talks about in the
[12:23] church ages book we're not going to have
[12:25] a literal Millennium it's a just a
[12:27] spiritual millennium wherein Christ
[12:30] rules the Nations through his church but
[12:32] as we find and look through the seven
[12:35] churches of Revelation which is our only
[12:37] prophetic view only only real prophetic
[12:41] view of the church Through the Ages what
[12:44] what do we see we see that the church
[12:46] slowly declines that there is a remnant
[12:49] of Overcomers but really at the end
[12:52] they're blind naked and don't know it
[12:56] amen the church actually goes downward
[12:59] not upward to rule the Earth but it
[13:02] actually ends just as Israel ended a
[13:05] Remnant believed a small Remnant
[13:08] believed and the rest were blind amen
[13:12] and God turned away from them to deal
[13:15] with the
[13:17] Gentiles and the we'll see that actually
[13:20] the reverse starts to happen in Romans
[13:23] in Romans 10: 11 the other portion that
[13:25] you want to think about is when we look
[13:27] at the times of the Gentiles
[13:29] we have two different things going on
[13:32] the minute that Israel was sent out
[13:36] from Jerusalem the the the the judaic
[13:40] kingdom the southern Kingdom the times
[13:42] of the Gentiles
[13:44] began right there was no long there was
[13:47] never again a Jewish
[13:49] Kingdom it was all through
[13:52] intermediaries they had government
[13:54] rulers and so forth but they had their
[13:56] overlords always above them except for
[13:59] maybe a few days under the the macbes
[14:04] but that was very short-lived and was
[14:07] wasn't uh maintainable but with that
[14:10] said it wasn't until 1948 and the
[14:13] battles that they faced in order to have
[14:16] their own sovereignty their own
[14:18] government up until that time it's been
[14:21] the times of the Gentiles that's
[14:23] politically speaking but then when you
[14:25] have him dealing turning spiritually and
[14:29] dealing with uh individuals that he
[14:32] calls out of the Nations that obviously
[14:35] happened uh starting with the church
[14:38] ages if we look at that closely we
[14:41] understand that there is a period of
[14:43] time between the crucifixion and the
[14:46] resurrection and the time when God turns
[14:49] when Paul at the end of the book of Acts
[14:53] close to 60 AD around 60 AD turns and
[14:57] says since you refused the gospel
[14:59] we turn and go to the Gentiles that
[15:01] that's a that's a critical time piece
[15:05] where God is turning away from Israel he
[15:08] gave them space excuse me to repent and
[15:11] to receive the Gospel that's what Peter
[15:13] is preaching every every time that he
[15:15] preaches and every time they preach to
[15:17] the Jews even Paul he first goes to the
[15:19] Jews in those places and he say do you
[15:21] want to repent you rejected the Messiah
[15:24] he's he's been raised from the dead do
[15:25] you want to repent they say no he said
[15:27] you've counted yourself Unworthy of
[15:30] eternal
[15:32] life so now we turn and deal with the
[15:34] Gentiles all right so we just laying
[15:38] that uh Foundation again and looking at
[15:43] Paul saying there's no difference under
[15:46] the gospel there's no difference between
[15:49] the Jew and the Greek whoever anyone who
[15:52] calls on the name of the Lord yes amen
[15:54] that's the only requirement is call on
[15:56] the name of the Lord and you'll be
[15:58] saying saved
[16:00] right it's not whether you're from this
[16:04] nation that Nation another Nation anyone
[16:06] on planet Earth that hears the gospel
[16:09] responds by faith
[16:12] repents follows the scripture acts 238
[16:16] they are recipients of the Gospel amen
[16:18] and
[16:20] salvation again and Paul is going on is
[16:24] trying to show the gospel how then shall
[16:26] they call on him who they have not
[16:28] believed how how shall they believe in
[16:29] him of whom they have not heard and how
[16:31] shall they hear without a
[16:34] preacher and how shall they preach
[16:36] except they be sent as it is written how
[16:37] beautiful are the feet of them that
[16:39] preach the gospel of peace and bring
[16:42] Glad Tidings of good things amen but
[16:47] they have not all obeyed the gospel for
[16:50] Isaiah saith Lord who has believed our
[16:53] report so then faith comes by hearing
[16:57] and hearing by the word of
[17:00] God so this is this is leveling the
[17:04] playing field across the board it's not
[17:06] based on your heritage where you
[17:08] circumcised the eighth day is your
[17:10] family o obeying that obeying the law it
[17:15] is a preacher is sent he proclaims the
[17:18] good news you hear and you
[17:21] believe that's
[17:26] it kind Paul everywhere Paul went the
[17:30] Jew the Jews went behind him and said
[17:31] you have to Paul is mixed up you have to
[17:34] become a disciple of
[17:36] Moses first everywhere he went and this
[17:40] confrontation came in Antioch they said
[17:42] Jews came from James in Jerusalem and he
[17:46] they're
[17:47] saying we have to be circumcised and
[17:50] follow the law of Moses in order to be
[17:52] saved Paul says this is a problem let's
[17:54] go there goes directly to them they
[17:57] solve it they solve it out but I want I
[17:59] want to point out something is God did
[18:01] not need the approval of any of the
[18:04] elders or Apostles at Jerusalem he sent
[18:08] Paul when they were in Antioch they were
[18:10] in their PR ministers meeting prayer
[18:12] meeting the Holy Spirit fell and said
[18:15] what can you go to Jerusalem and ask if
[18:18] it's okay for Paul and Barnabas go to
[18:21] the Gentiles the Holy Spirit didn't ask
[18:23] for anybody's approval they didn't ask
[18:26] for the council to meet the Holy Spirit
[18:28] came and spoke and said separate unto me
[18:31] Paul and Barnabas for the work where
[18:33] unto I've called them and what did he do
[18:36] he sent them to the Gentiles amen and
[18:40] what what message did Paul preach to
[18:41] come and believe the law come and come
[18:44] and become a disciple of Moses and then
[18:45] you can become a disciple of Christ is
[18:48] that how the Holy Spirit work Paul said
[18:50] to the Galatians this only would I learn
[18:52] of you did you receive the Spirit by The
[18:56] Works of the law or by the hearing of
[18:59] Faith amen so God is himself chose a one
[19:05] born out of du season who fought against
[19:08] the disciples who hated them persecuted
[19:10] them even blasphemed the Lord Jesus by
[19:14] killing his disciples here he raises
[19:17] this man up sends them out and even they
[19:19] are bewildered by what he is
[19:21] doing and they come forward and it takes
[19:23] Peter to raise up and say hey don't you
[19:25] remember when I preached the gospel
[19:27] didn't the Lord the Holy Spirit did
[19:28] didn't ask me to make them
[19:30] Disciples of Moses first what did the
[19:33] Holy Spirit ask me to do he said don't
[19:36] call anything unclean that I have
[19:41] cleansed so Peter has to raise up and
[19:44] defend them instead well they write a
[19:45] letter uh don't eat meat
[19:49] strangled uh don't make sure the blood
[19:51] is drained from it how many do you do
[19:54] that why did you reject the Jerusalem
[19:57] Council
[19:59] because Paul said nothing is unclean and
[20:02] who was the Vindicated messenger of the
[20:04] age the Jerusalem Council or
[20:06] Paul again this is God's leadership of
[20:10] the Holy Spirit dealing with them faith
[20:12] comes by hearing you don't know how
[20:15] amazing this is we don't we don't grasp
[20:18] the grace and love of God hear my word
[20:23] respond to
[20:24] it and you're saved simple as that whe
[20:28] whether you're a Jew or whether you're a
[20:30] gentile that's
[20:32] it Verse 18 but I say have you have they
[20:35] not heard yes verily their sound went
[20:37] into all the Earth and their words under
[20:39] the ends of the world but I say did not
[20:40] Israel know first Moses saith I will
[20:43] provoke you to jealousy by them that are
[20:46] no people and by a foolish Nation I will
[20:50] anger
[20:51] you so if they would have had in other
[20:53] words Paul is saying if they would have
[20:54] had a revelation of the scriptures they
[20:56] would understand God saving the the
[20:58] Gentiles should should open your eyes
[21:01] and make you repent amen didn't they
[21:04] know they they have Moses they can read
[21:07] what Moses
[21:09] said verse 20 but Isaiah is very bold
[21:12] and saith I I was found of them that
[21:15] sought me not I Was Made manifest unto
[21:18] them that ask not after me but to Israel
[21:22] he saith all day long I have stretched
[21:24] forth my hands unto a disobedient and
[21:27] gain SA
[21:30] people I say then has G has God okay
[21:35] here here's the question has God Cast
[21:37] Away his
[21:39] people because this is the
[21:41] Viewpoint that Christians are starting
[21:44] to take in this day in this in this in
[21:47] in this political environment and in
[21:49] this madness that's going around pro-
[21:53] Hamas
[21:55] Palestinian nonsense supporting
[21:58] terrorist
[22:01] yeah so then I asked the
[22:04] question has God Cast Away his
[22:08] people God forbid may it never be is
[22:11] what Paul is saying for I also am an
[22:14] Israel of the Seed of Abraham of the
[22:16] tribe of Tribe of Benjamin God has not
[22:19] Cast Away his people which he fornew or
[22:21] which he for
[22:23] ordained what ye not what the scripture
[22:25] saith of Isa Elias how he maketh inter
[22:28] intercession to God against Israel
[22:30] saying Lord they have killed thy
[22:32] prophets and dig down thine altars and I
[22:34] am left alone and they seek my life but
[22:37] what sayith the answer of God unto him I
[22:39] have reserved to myself 7,000 men who
[22:43] have bowed not bowed the knee to the
[22:46] image of Baal
[22:49] amen even so then at this present time
[22:52] also there is a Remnant according to the
[22:55] election of Grace and if by grace then
[22:58] is no more of Works otherwise Grace is
[23:00] no more Grace but if it be of works then
[23:02] it is no more grace otherwise work is no
[23:05] more work in other words there's a
[23:07] predestinated seed that's going to come
[23:10] to Salvation amen there's there's a
[23:13] Remnant there even at the time of Paul
[23:16] there was a Remnant there that would
[23:17] receive the grace of
[23:20] God what then Israel has not obtained
[23:24] that what he that which he seeks for but
[23:27] the election hath obtained it and the
[23:30] rest were
[23:31] blinded according as it is written God
[23:34] has given them the Spirit of Slumber
[23:36] eyes that they should not see and ears
[23:38] that they should not hear unto this
[23:42] day so it's not every single member of
[23:46] the nation of Israel that will be saved
[23:49] only the elect will obtain it that's
[23:52] true for all of
[23:54] history right Paul is not bringing
[23:56] anything new anything different he's
[23:58] trying trying to point out you guys are
[24:00] so infatuated with the nation of Israel
[24:02] and being part of Israel but you're not
[24:04] remembering the fact that even through
[24:07] all the ages it's only the elect y'all
[24:09] have been
[24:10] stubborn he's he's one of them we've
[24:13] been stubborn this whole
[24:14] time God has constantly been reaching
[24:17] his hand out and we've constantly
[24:19] rejected and turned turned against him
[24:22] but who obtains salvation the elect
[24:25] right
[24:27] am and and David saith let their table
[24:30] be made a snare and a trap and a
[24:31] stumbling block and a recompense unto
[24:33] them let their eyes be darkened that
[24:36] they may not see and bow down their back
[24:39] always I say then have they stumbled
[24:42] that they should
[24:43] fall again it's a question have they
[24:46] stumbled to the point where they've
[24:48] fallen and they'll never rise again I
[24:50] think that's that's the essential idea
[24:53] that Paul is looking at have they
[24:56] stumbled that they should fall they've
[24:58] stumbled and then the way we look at it
[25:00] they fell but not in the not in the
[25:03] sense that this is it this is the
[25:06] end God forbid he says but rather
[25:10] through their fall salvation is come
[25:12] unto the Gentiles for to provoke them to
[25:17] jealousy all right so through their fall
[25:22] from the Grace from from their rejection
[25:25] of the
[25:26] Messiah what happens salvation comes to
[25:29] the
[25:30] Nations the reason why he turned away
[25:33] from Israel was not because he hated
[25:36] Israel he was done with Israel he was
[25:38] turning from Israel to S to take a
[25:40] people for his name's sake from among
[25:42] the
[25:43] Nations to do what was the purpose what
[25:46] is his purpose of doing that even that
[25:48] purpose was to fulfill his plan which is
[25:51] to provoke them to
[25:53] jealousy that they would repent now if
[25:56] the fall of them be the rich es of the
[25:59] world and the diminishing of them The
[26:02] Riches of the Gentiles how much more
[26:05] their
[26:07] fullness how much more Israel's fullness
[26:11] will be a blessing so if their fall is a
[26:13] blessing how much more their restoration
[26:16] will be a blessing and the Fulfillment
[26:19] of God's purpose for them will be a
[26:22] blessing for I speak to you Gentiles in
[26:24] as much as I am the Apostle of the
[26:27] Gentiles I magnify my office if by any
[26:30] means I may Pro provoke to emulation
[26:33] them which are my flesh and might save
[26:36] some of
[26:38] them for if the casting away of them be
[26:41] the reconciling of the world what shall
[26:44] be the receiving of them be but life
[26:47] from the dead amen so think about that
[26:51] when the r when the Rapture happens what
[26:53] does God do the Rapture happens
[26:56] immediately he's turned to the back to
[26:58] the nation of
[27:00] Israel for if the first fruit be holy
[27:03] the lump is also holy and if the root be
[27:06] holy so are the branches wow all right
[27:11] so the the
[27:13] tree the fruit the lump and the branches
[27:18] all
[27:19] right and if some of the branches be
[27:22] broken off and thou being a wild Olive
[27:26] Tree were Graft in among them and with
[27:28] them partak us of the root and fatness
[27:31] of the Olive Tree boast not against the
[27:34] branches but if thou boast thou bearest
[27:36] not the root but the root
[27:38] thee so again this is this is the root
[27:42] of this is the tree The Olive Tree he's
[27:45] saying that the natural branches are
[27:47] what Israel the natural branches are
[27:50] what they're cut
[27:51] off if we take this back to another
[27:54] place as we know that branches that
[27:56] don't bear fruit are cut off are per
[27:58] purged right so he's purged them off
[28:01] because they refused to Bear the fruit
[28:04] of the Messiah so he's cut them off and
[28:08] he's taken us we're just grown out in
[28:10] the wild there he's taken us wild
[28:12] Nations Gentiles and graft us into the
[28:16] tree of Salvation
[28:19] amen and we're not to boast we're not to
[28:21] say hey we're the we're now the branches
[28:25] Israel's finished is that exactly
[28:29] what these denominational people are
[28:31] doing they're boasting and saying we're
[28:33] the replacement we're the replacement
[28:36] Israel's finished how are you boasting
[28:39] God can take those it's God he can take
[28:42] a dead Branch laying on the ground put
[28:45] it back into a tree and bring life to
[28:49] it thou Willl say then the branches were
[28:52] broken off that I might be grafted in
[28:54] see how great I am I must have been so
[28:56] great in God's sight that he found me
[29:00] out in the wild and brought me in and
[29:02] put me no why are you
[29:06] boasting well because of unbelief they
[29:09] were broken off and thou standest by
[29:12] faith be not high-minded but
[29:16] fear again this is looking at a
[29:20] prophetic picture this isn't looking at
[29:22] actual individuals this is looking at
[29:24] the prophetic picture of the of the
[29:26] Gentile bride and the spiritual nation
[29:30] of Israel not the not the natural Nation
[29:32] merely but the spiritual Nation so he's
[29:35] bringing these both both of these things
[29:37] one gets broken off he's committed them
[29:39] to
[29:40] blindness for if God spared not the
[29:42] natural branches take heed lest he also
[29:46] spare not
[29:47] thee behold therefore the goodness and
[29:50] sever let me pause for a second it it's
[29:52] important to understand this as a
[29:55] prophetic picture not as an individual
[29:57] if we understand understand this as an
[29:58] individual we would get the idea that
[30:01] well I can
[30:04] just and and will cut me off and then
[30:09] put someone else in there this isn't
[30:11] talking about that portion of Salvation
[30:15] you C if you have the Holy Ghost you're
[30:18] you're not going to fall in unbelief and
[30:20] be cut off because getting the getting
[30:22] the true baptism of the Holy Ghost in
[30:23] the soul you're sealed until the day of
[30:26] your Redemption amen right so we can't
[30:29] look at the you can't take this
[30:31] scripture and begin to contradict other
[30:33] scriptures you have to understand it in
[30:35] the big picture God is going to wind up
[30:38] things for the Gentile
[30:40] bride God is going to restore back the
[30:43] nation of
[30:45] Israel to what he's dealing with
[30:47] spiritually he's already naturally
[30:49] restored
[30:51] them and we'll get into it later but the
[30:53] scripture shows that he'll restore them
[30:55] back to their Nation while they're still
[30:58] in
[30:59] unbelief and that once they're restored
[31:01] even in unbelief he will then
[31:04] spiritually give restore them and give
[31:08] that 144,000 the Holy Ghost AM behold
[31:12] therefore the goodness and severity of
[31:15] God on them which fell severity but
[31:17] toward thee goodness if thou continue in
[31:20] his goodness otherwise Thou shalt also
[31:23] be cut off
[31:24] again we we can't you don't take this
[31:28] and apply it to personal
[31:30] salvation because you you're not going
[31:33] to fall in unbelief and be cut off
[31:36] that's not how God operates once Christ
[31:39] has drawn
[31:41] you all that Jesus said all that the
[31:44] father has given me will come to me and
[31:47] I will in no wise cast them out
[31:52] right he
[31:55] said that he would not lose one of his
[31:58] Sheep amen so he's not going to graph
[32:02] you you were a pig now he transforms you
[32:05] to a lamb then you make a mistake now he
[32:08] turns you back to a pig no you're a
[32:12] sheep you're predestinated
[32:14] seed he has a he has a very specific
[32:18] purpose that he's coming to look for you
[32:20] as an individual to seal you with the
[32:23] Holy
[32:24] Ghost he's not going to change he
[32:26] doesn't does God change his mind about
[32:28] anything
[32:30] no so this is not speaking about that
[32:32] this is speaking about the big picture
[32:35] so the big picture is what the Jews
[32:39] slowly and steadily fell into unbelief
[32:43] until they were almost completely blind
[32:46] there was just a small remnant of
[32:48] Believers even to this day there's just
[32:50] a small Remnant in of true Jewish
[32:56] Believers what happens in the church
[32:59] ages the church what does it do almost
[33:02] right away as soon as the apostles are
[33:03] gone they start to fall away from the
[33:05] original
[33:06] faith it goes through such Darkness
[33:10] until God restores the church back
[33:13] begins at the Reformation to step by
[33:15] step bring this restoration but what
[33:18] happens at the at the LA at at the very
[33:20] end is the majority of the church World
[33:22] rejects the restoration
[33:25] message and so God has no nothing to do
[33:28] but Smite the Earth with the curse
[33:30] they've rejected the messenger and his
[33:33] message so God will then turn away from
[33:37] the Gentiles who've rejected that
[33:39] message he'll he'll take up the ones
[33:41] that have received that message and
[33:43] he'll turn back to the Jews through the
[33:46] two witnesses all right so this is what
[33:49] this is the idea that's he's going to
[33:50] cut off the Gentiles because they're in
[33:52] unbelief and he turns back to the
[33:55] Jews and they also if they abide not
[33:58] still in unbelief shall be grafted in
[34:00] for God is able to graft them in again
[34:02] for if thou W cut out of the Olive Tree
[34:04] which is Wild by nature and were grafted
[34:07] contrary to Nature into a good Olive
[34:08] Tree how much more shall these which be
[34:11] the natural branches be grafted into
[34:13] their own olive
[34:15] tree for I would not Brethren that you
[34:17] should be ignorant of this mystery lest
[34:19] you should be wise in your own conceits
[34:22] that blindness in part is happened to
[34:24] Israel until the fullness of the Gentile
[34:27] become in all right so there you go once
[34:31] the last this is where we come to this
[34:34] ideaa and understanding that when the
[34:38] last predestinated seed comes in he
[34:40] turns to deal with the the Jews see when
[34:44] the fullness when the the total number
[34:47] of the predestinated seed among the
[34:49] Gentiles to the bride body has been
[34:52] sealed by the Holy Ghost that's when God
[34:55] will turn and deal with Israel and so
[34:58] all Israel shall be saved as as it is
[35:00] written there shall come out of Zion the
[35:02] deliverer and shall turn away
[35:03] ungodliness from
[35:05] Jacob don't have time to cover it but
[35:07] looking at that all Israel shall be
[35:10] saved now number one dealing with them
[35:12] as a nation sure but number two is it's
[35:16] 144,000 elected from each tribe but
[35:20] nationally he saves them how through
[35:23] those 144,000 there's much to cover when
[35:25] we go into this and we're out of time
[35:30] I better quit there let's
[35:35] stand Heavenly Father we thank you so
[35:37] much for your word we ask Lord that you
[35:39] be with us this morning you bless the
[35:42] worship help us to get ourselves get our
[35:44] thoughts out of the way Lord that we can
[35:47] focus upon you and remember we're not
[35:49] here for ourselves or for our own
[35:52] gratification Lord but we're here to
[35:55] worship and glorify you Lord and to
