[0:23] for the JD is out of town and actually
[0:27] may end up being gone over the next
[0:29] several weekends so brother Matt and I
[0:32] are gonna tag-team a little bit and fill
[0:37] in for that I kind of have a two-fold
[0:40] purpose in my heart today not to just
[0:43] bring up a Sunday School lesson but also
[0:46] to kind of update the church on where we
[0:50] are on a number of issues some things I
[0:53] want to make some announcements on
[0:56] that'd be all right so let's let's um
[1:04] let's go to Matthew chapter 24 excuse me
[1:09] I'll get cleared up here in a minute and
[1:12] we'll start at verse 3 and as he sat
[1:21] upon the Mount of Olives the disciples
[1:23] came unto him privately saying tell us
[1:27] when shall these things be and what
[1:29] shall be the sign of thy coming and of
[1:32] the end of the world and jesus answered
[1:36] and said unto them take heed that no man
[1:38] deceive you that's a good warning isn't
[1:40] it for many shall come in my name saying
[1:46] I am Christ and shall deceive many and
[1:51] you shall hear of wars and rumors of
[1:54] wars see that you be not troubled and
[1:58] that a beautiful promise see that ye be
[2:00] not troubled for all these things must
[2:03] come to pass but the end is not yet for
[2:07] nation shall rise against nation the
[2:09] king and Kingdom against Kingdom and
[2:11] there shall be famines
[2:13] and pestilences and earthquakes in
[2:16] diverse places all these are the
[2:20] beginning of Sorrows then shall they
[2:23] deliver you up to be afflicted and shall
[2:25] kill you
[2:26] and you shall be hated of all nations
[2:28] for my name's sake and then shall many
[2:32] be offended and shall betray one another
[2:34] and shall hate one another and many
[2:36] false prophets shall rise and shall
[2:39] deceive many and because iniquity shall
[2:43] abound the love of many shall wax cold
[2:47] but he that endured to unto the end the
[2:51] same shall be saved and this gospel of
[2:55] the kingdom shall be preached in all the
[2:57] world for a witness unto all nations and
[3:01] then shall the end come let's bow our
[3:05] heads we thank you most kindly Lord this
[3:10] morning our great friend and protector
[3:13] our great Savior and our healer our
[3:16] Redeemer the lifter up of my hands Lord
[3:19] I just thank you this morning and I just
[3:22] would like to say at the reading of this
[3:25] word Lord I'm so glad that you promised
[3:28] there'd be a solution to all the madness
[3:30] of the world you promised that you would
[3:33] never leave us nor forsake us it was
[3:35] such a promise Lord I will never leave
[3:38] you Lord what a promise that is so I'm
[3:42] asking today that you come and speak to
[3:45] us out of your word Lord we we love
[3:49] ministering the word it's it's my whole
[3:51] life I've dedicated my whole life to it
[3:53] Lord and so many times how faithful you
[3:57] are over the years always Lord you bring
[4:00] a fresh manna to the people I thank you
[4:03] for that we thank you for those gathered
[4:05] here today for those who aren't allowed
[4:07] to gather with us today who would no
[4:09] doubt be here then Lord we're praying
[4:11] now in these troubles some unsettling
[4:14] times that you give us peace that passes
[4:17] understanding that you that you Lord and
[4:20] just give us an increase of that we know
[4:22] it's a promise to us may just turn up
[4:24] the volume a little bit Lord
[4:26] I pray to settle our hearts and minds
[4:28] that we may only only look to your word
[4:32] and all your promises for they're all
[4:34] true all your word is true and all your
[4:37] ways are right we thank you now and ask
[4:40] that we be dedicated to you for service
[4:42] today in Jesus name Amen god bless
[4:45] friends you can be seated it's an
[4:55] amazing reading that we have taken here
[4:58] and you know the the to me when I began
[5:03] to read Matthew 24 with its ominous
[5:06] foreboding prophecies that are coming
[5:12] upon the world there are several things
[5:14] that have always historically stand out
[5:17] to me and I would say that today like no
[5:20] other day before they stand out even
[5:23] more so that one of the first
[5:27] observations that I make in this is that
[5:30] you know Jesus is warning against
[5:33] deception in fact when you read down
[5:37] through that where we read this morning
[5:40] you can see the spirit that would
[5:42] afflict the ages of the Gentile Church
[5:46] going forward because the very first
[5:49] horse rider is a white horse and we know
[5:54] that the that the fact that he took it
[5:56] as a white horse was God it's not that
[6:00] Satan is riding a white horse you
[6:03] understand God showed John a white horse
[6:06] as a symbology as a symbolism of the
[6:10] characteristics of the Antichrist spirit
[6:13] in that first age and because it was
[6:16] white it would tend to make you think
[6:18] purity holiness righteousness this must
[6:22] be Jesus Christ when in fact just the
[6:25] opposite was true so actually it became
[6:30] the the deception you couldn't get it's
[6:36] God saying you know I'm going to let me
[6:39] all through heaven and let me pick a
[6:43] symbol and I all through the book of
[6:47] Revelation when John writes it later
[6:50] you're going to see a lot of symbols so
[6:53] I I want to go through my book of
[6:56] symbols and I want to pick the the one
[7:00] that would describe deception the most
[7:05] that I couldn't possibly use a greater
[7:09] symbol now you would think he would have
[7:12] chose maybe a snake or rat or something
[7:16] like that something that would deceive
[7:18] something that's sneaky something that's
[7:20] destructive but if you'll recognize
[7:23] Jesus knowing that at the end of the
[7:28] Tribulation Period
[7:29] that the king of kings would ride out on
[7:33] a white horse and the armies of heaven
[7:37] the bride would literally follow with
[7:40] him now if he's going to use the Lord
[7:45] Jesus himself as king of kings and Lord
[7:49] of lords and all the bride the armies of
[7:52] heaven on white horses and that's going
[7:54] to represent that's the simple he
[7:56] chooses for the highest pinnacle of
[7:58] purity honesty holiness perfection then
[8:05] what better symbol could he choose if he
[8:08] wanted to to warn his church that equal
[8:12] to Christ in His righteousness the
[8:15] Antichrist will be in his deceiving so
[8:21] he literally picks a white horse which
[8:25] means it's a deceiver and Satan goes
[8:28] forth to deceive and Jesus is warning
[8:31] this is one of the right out of the box
[8:34] the disciples are asking him about the
[8:37] end of the world one of these things
[8:38] coming and all you've you've said a lot
[8:40] of bad things when is all this going to
[8:41] happen and he right out of the box he's
[8:44] going to say listen take heed don't take
[8:47] heed first about wars don't take heed
[8:51] about riots
[8:53] don't take don't worry so much about
[8:55] upheaval you're gonna always have that
[8:58] you're gonna see earthquakes you're
[9:00] gonna see nature convulsing you're gonna
[9:02] see signs in the heaven you're gonna see
[9:05] insanity in the world but here is the
[9:08] first thing I want to tell my church be
[9:11] careful because it'll be so easy to be
[9:15] deceived that not only will men go forth
[9:20] claiming to be me he was saying there
[9:23] will actually be a whole lot of them not
[9:26] only will there be a false prophet
[9:30] there's gonna be a lot of them and guess
[9:34] what as if I can't make it any worse
[9:37] here's making it worse they're gonna
[9:39] deceive many people you know what you
[9:45] talk about a prophet sometimes and
[9:47] people just from a position of ignorance
[9:49] and lack of teaching you know I don't
[9:52] say that disparaging that it's being a
[9:53] lack of teaching that day you begin to
[9:56] talk about a prophet and they say always
[9:58] and they're supposed to be a false
[9:59] prophet and I'm like no they're supposed
[10:02] to be a lot of them and guess what
[10:05] they're gonna deceive a whole lot of
[10:06] people in fact is there's gonna be so
[10:10] many they're gonna end up deceiving the
[10:12] majority of the world and then as if
[10:17] that's not bad enough then there's gonna
[10:20] be Wars there's gonna be rumors of wars
[10:23] there's gonna be pestilences there's
[10:25] gonna be diseases and plagues and
[10:28] earthquakes and signs in nature and the
[10:31] and the world is going to go through
[10:33] constant upheaval and trouble because my
[10:37] prophets words have gotten to come to
[10:40] pass man born of a woman is but a few
[10:42] days and full of trouble so it's it's it
[10:49] almost you know that's why sometimes
[10:51] when when Jesus sent them into the world
[10:53] and and you know everybody has this
[10:56] notion if we could just get the whole
[10:58] world to be Christians if we get this
[11:01] get this country you know to all be
[11:03] Christians and receive the God
[11:05] oh we could save it brother BAM said put
[11:08] a George Washington and an Abraham
[11:09] Lincoln in every single County you won't
[11:11] turn it around the gospel didn't come to
[11:15] save the world the gospel came to save
[11:19] man out of the world the world is going
[11:23] to be destroyed as we know it now the
[11:26] Earth's not going to be annihilated even
[11:28] times not going to end when the rapture
[11:30] comes even at the end of the tribulation
[11:32] and God just simply gonna pull his bride
[11:35] out of the world and let Satan have at
[11:37] it and that pale horse riders going to
[11:39] be all the deception of the white horse
[11:41] all of the murderous spirit of the red
[11:44] horse all of the dark ages of the black
[11:46] horse and and he's going to be all
[11:49] rolled up into one
[11:51] pale grizzly horse in it and that that
[11:55] pale grizzly colored horse means sickly
[11:59] the combination of all of these demon
[12:03] powers that have gotten to practice in
[12:06] two thousand years are going to bring
[12:08] their training book and all of their
[12:10] knowledge and come down
[12:11] head-and-shoulders to the world at the
[12:14] end time and it's going to be it's going
[12:17] to be such a combination of of religious
[12:20] and political and demon power that it's
[12:25] going to literally bring sickness upon
[12:28] the world not just physical diseases
[12:33] that they already have more than they
[12:35] have answers for and they've got ones
[12:37] coming that make the ones they have now
[12:39] seem like nothing not just physical
[12:43] sickness mental sickness spiritual
[12:47] sickness emotional sickness you know
[12:52] financial political every kind of that
[12:56] you're living in an age of sickness and
[13:00] the pale horse riders the world ought to
[13:05] be glad because as sick as everything is
[13:09] they haven't seen anything once the
[13:12] bride goes your presence is hindering
[13:16] his full authoritative ride
[13:18] he can't ride in his full string a
[13:21] profit come according to revelation
[13:23] unidentified him said his and the Bible
[13:26] calls him death and hell followed him
[13:28] and a prophet comes on the scene and
[13:30] identifies who that is to this age and
[13:33] and but that's that's as far as it got
[13:36] and identified his workings
[13:38] he certainly mounted but he cannot begin
[13:42] his full ride because he that letteth
[13:45] that's Christ will let until he in the
[13:48] bride misses Jesus be taken out of the
[13:50] way and then all of these all of these
[13:54] things that have been in a measure to
[13:57] the world that's why you see such an
[14:00] upheaval that's why you see such a
[14:02] heaping up you know Jesus talked about
[14:05] Paul talked about perilous times I've
[14:07] said this before Paul was an absent of
[14:11] perilous times when he said in the last
[14:12] days perilous times shall come
[14:14] he was an absent of perilous times at
[14:16] that time so then the only conclusion
[14:20] you can come to sensibly is that Paul
[14:23] was saying hey when it gets to the end
[14:25] right near the catching away you're
[14:28] talking about perilous what we have now
[14:31] is nothing compared to what hey you're
[14:34] there you're living in it you're living
[14:37] what Paul's day told would come here I'm
[14:41] gonna take something friends if there
[14:43] was ever a time to be close to God if
[14:46] there was ever a time to have your life
[14:49] filled under the full control of the
[14:52] Holy Ghost
[14:54] you can certainly be born again of the
[14:57] Spirit of God and not very spiritually
[14:59] healthy if you if the baptism of the
[15:04] Holy Ghost finished you as a product you
[15:06] would have already been raptured you
[15:07] wouldn't need to read your Bible and
[15:09] pray but you do and you're still here
[15:14] and you do need to read your Bible and
[15:16] pray you do need to attend church you do
[15:18] need the fellowship of the sinks you do
[15:20] need to hear the tapes you do need to to
[15:23] have faith amen because we are facing
[15:27] unprecedented time and with that
[15:32] unprecedented errors it has never before
[15:39] in the history of the Christian Church
[15:42] from the earliest days of the Upper Room
[15:48] through the ministry of st. Paul all the
[15:52] way out to John the last apostle to go
[15:56] home all through the ages and every star
[16:00] that came out of his right hand
[16:01] including the last one it has never been
[16:08] suggested to the true church that you
[16:13] should just stay at home and push play
[16:18] that is unprecedented in Christian
[16:23] history no prophet ever suggested such a
[16:28] thing Paul never suggested you did that
[16:32] the church stay at home and read his
[16:34] letters his advice was go and assemble
[16:40] that God has raised up apostles and
[16:44] prophets and pastors and teachers and
[16:46] evangelists and their function is for
[16:48] the perfecting and the edifying of the
[16:50] Saints and the church it has never been
[16:53] suggested
[16:54] nor was it suggested even remotely by
[16:59] the last day prophet not even a shadow
[17:04] not a third cousin removed twice never
[17:09] ever that is a false doctrine it is an
[17:15] anti word teaching the prophet of God of
[17:20] this day said if it's anti word its
[17:24] Antichrist
[17:25] I love brother branham's ability and we
[17:29] should mirror it to never brother
[17:31] Branham was talking said I'm not talking
[17:33] about the people I'm talking about the
[17:37] system I'm not up here today calling out
[17:41] people I'm calling out a teaching that's
[17:44] an error
[17:45] that's a Antichrist teaching and no
[17:49] doubt very good well minded
[17:51] well-intentioned people are propagating
[17:54] that but I'm here to tell you it's a lie
[17:56] it's a trick of the devil
[18:00] and it was never taught from Paul to
[18:04] William Branham ever in fact is the
[18:08] polar opposite which you can't get more
[18:12] opposite than polar opposite the polar
[18:15] opposite is true
[18:17] the complete inverse is true that
[18:21] brother Branham and Paul bookending the
[18:24] Church agents with prophets cried out to
[18:27] the people that you need a pastor you
[18:29] need a church you need fellowship you
[18:32] need to assemble you need to come
[18:34] together so I know today I'm preaching
[18:38] to the choir when I preach on this if I
[18:41] wasn't preaching to the choir you
[18:42] wouldn't be here I know I'm preaching to
[18:46] the choir but I also know that that is a
[18:48] burgeoning thought among people and my
[18:51] heart full of love loves them too much
[18:54] to leave them uninformed that that is a
[18:57] false teaching and the people who are
[19:01] teaching it need to repent of it we
[19:06] already have perilous times we already
[19:12] have everything that Jesus prophesied
[19:16] already multiplied the last thing we
[19:20] need is such a divisive error among the
[19:23] bride as that let me tell you something
[19:27] friends let me tell you something today
[19:28] I want to make this statement stick with
[19:32] tape teaching I almost say that again I
[19:36] should have had a hundred percent stay
[19:39] with tape teaching tape teaching tells
[19:44] you to assemble with a shepherd tape
[19:48] teaching upholds the entire fivefold
[19:51] ministry until
[19:53] Lord calls us home that is tape teaching
[19:57] please ignore me stay with tape teaching
[20:04] I'm so glad we have a perfect Bible I'm
[20:10] so glad we have 1200 tapes to make sure
[20:14] that we stay lined up because if we
[20:16] doesn't have they said oh we don't need
[20:17] those well if you didn't have those 1200
[20:20] plus tapes you don't want you to have
[20:21] you'd have 2,000 years of theory on what
[20:26] these old ancient letters implied you'd
[20:30] have two thousand years of good men good
[20:32] men very fine men in errors even God's
[20:38] some of his church age messengers
[20:41] unfailing to understand things like the
[20:43] Godhead incorrect baptism even though
[20:48] the Bible says in the concerning the
[20:50] name of Jesus there's no other name
[20:52] given under heaven that you can even be
[20:54] saved by and yet God's very stars in his
[20:56] hand misunderstood and failed to catch
[20:58] that and preach the Trinitarian
[21:00] understanding God rich in mercy winked
[21:03] at their ignorance he had to he couldn't
[21:05] he couldn't show respect to persons he
[21:07] had winked at Israel's ignorance Paul
[21:08] said that hey acts 13 yeah you sixteen
[21:11] hundred years you had a system you
[21:13] abused it God winked at your ignorance
[21:15] but now Christ has come now the fullness
[21:18] is here now he requires all men to
[21:20] repent that's the same thing that's
[21:22] happened at this last day the seals have
[21:24] been open and now God says no more
[21:25] winking in ignorance I've sent you a
[21:27] message I've tied but I've made this
[21:30] become thus saith the Lord to you I've
[21:32] made it a living book I've made it a
[21:33] fresh kill there's no more excuse so if
[21:37] you didn't have 1200 tapes you'd be just
[21:39] as twisted off off down of trails as the
[21:43] rest of the denominational world I'm
[21:45] glad for 1200 tapes
[21:49] I'm glad that that you have a surety you
[21:54] can go to if I go into error I would
[21:57] advise you listen to them listen to that
[22:01] tape open your Bible read along the
[22:03] Prophet was a word prophet you'll learn
[22:06] so much
[22:06] about your Bible if you listen to the
[22:08] tapes it's amazing I mean believers
[22:09] never listen to tapes and I don't know
[22:13] which is worse
[22:14] never or only they both do destructive
[22:20] they both have destructive byproducts
[22:25] that they bring in a believers life
[22:28] because one is they're both they're both
[22:32] underpowered because if that's that's
[22:35] what if that's what if you didn't need
[22:38] tapes to listen to God wouldn't have
[22:40] gave them to you and if you only needed
[22:44] that then God wouldn't have ever raised
[22:45] up a fivefold ministry God's not doesn't
[22:47] do things redundantly
[22:49] or for no purpose so the whole thing is
[22:53] insensible you you you you can't even
[22:56] make the scripture and that's why
[22:57] brother Branham was so clear on this
[22:59] subject
[23:00] I'm gonna take some friends I love this
[23:02] that in the last verse we read and this
[23:05] gospel of the kingdom shall be preached
[23:07] in all the world
[23:08] that's this gospel that's not you that
[23:13] the word the end of the world couldn't
[23:15] have come if the message hadn't come
[23:17] because this gospel he's referring to
[23:21] 2,000 years ago got lost and before the
[23:25] end of the world that gospel would have
[23:27] to come back and we have it thank God
[23:32] now this gospel is that gospel that this
[23:36] is this and we have it and it's going
[23:40] around the world blessed be the name of
[23:42] the Lord
[23:43] and now the end can come and I am so
[23:51] thrilled to be a part of that amen
[23:56] god bless you let's stand
[24:02] father we thank you for your word thank
[24:05] you for your kindness to come Lord with
[24:08] your anointing felt it Lord just as soon
[24:10] as I walked up felt your direction and
[24:12] leadership taking no thought of my own
[24:14] nothing that I said today from my very
[24:18] text to the last word of stand up none
[24:21] of it was planned not a single word of
[24:24] it so I thank you for that in Jesus name
[24:27] Amen
[24:28] god bless you friends we'll have a
[24:30] recess and we'll get started with the
[24:31] regular service god bless
