morning greet you all in the name of the lord jesus and you can be seated momentarily i just want to make a few quick announcements [Music] amen praise the lord you love him it's been good to be here this morning we've already had quite a bit of business conducted this morning sorry we had to cancel our sunday school class we needed that time to have a little meeting of mines this morning with the various trustees and our team team leads for our building project and so at the end of today um we'd like to give you just a at the end of service kind of like sometimes when we transition to a baptism we're going to transition to just a brief construction update brother matt has a brief presentation to present to you and then we're going to ask the mark is going to come up and also kind of give you the perspective of your trustees remember the trustees are representatives of the people they are your representatives and uh and so they're going to come up and give you brother mark speaking for them to give you their reflections on our plans um so just if you will today at the end of service um we'll transition to that and i don't expect that it would take more than just a few minutes i would think maybe uh maybe 15 or so minutes and then also you gotta notice yesterday that uh we're needing to take family photos after dismissal after dismissal is complete and you're dismissed outside if you will please make yourself available to sister emily she's volunteered to assist sister wanda in gathering pictures amen sister wanda has done that so many years so faithfully and works her to death and we make it hard because we don't we don't show up for photos and sister debbie and i and my family and i'm please everybody make sure you're ready to take some photos so even if i'm haggard today after preaching and you drain me out i'm still gonna take a picture amen so um we want to just have that after service today so the twins have a birthday today now i heard now one of y'all's older which one is it i bet i bet he never lets you forget brother caleb that he's actually older than you hey 13 minutes wow praise the lord sister debbie's like 13 or 14 days older than me she never lets me forget it when we're in a discussion amen i'll you know be friendly a friendly discussion no honey it says no honey no sweetheart to say you know i'm older than you and i know better so i told her one time she was telling me you know uh you know did you do this i said no i just you know i told you to do that so honey i don't always do what you tell me she says but your life would be so much better if you did and i i had to say amen i really couldn't deny that so amen but we want to um wish the twins have birthday day we're happy to have them here always front and center i love seeing them here on the front i love seeing young men especially right on the front amen praise the lord amen brother jerry you're here god bless you so you surprised her today surprised her amen be careful don't you set a pattern and that'll that'll go forever so be careful about you know too many surprises i i've i have walked out of places before sister debbie she got used to me opening the door well sometimes i'm behind her and you know how many times i've almost smashed into the door because she gets to the door and just stops i'm like okay so you just you just watch out for amen because you set patterns and it becomes precedence amen but it's a good thing it's a good pattern to set amen so we have those meetings that we want to gather after service today at the end of service we'll have a quick 15 or so minute update for you it's preliminary we're still working it all out but we kind of want to bring you up to speed on our thinking and then after dismiss so we have photos to take so please if you can make yourself available i've got a number of prayer requests today i want to pray for brother joe who had to go home today he was here earlier i think he came in and and then or i'm not sure about that i remember i think he walked in earlier and then i understand he's at home not feeling well so we want to be praying for him amen um then sister rebecca sent me an update for brother frank cronkite now he had a some a kidney procedure and there's been complications from that so we're asking the lord uh for mercy for him also sister nita writes please

i have any other announcements let's stand amen go to the lord in prayer sister debbie and i were able to uh visit with uh sister jan hall the other day went in and sat down with her and brother gary had some really lovely fellowship and we had an opportunity just to stand and gather in a little circle of four and just uh pray for our sister and call on the name of the lord that he would be merciful to her amen i i just want to ask the lord constantly that he restore destroy that cancerous demon and see our sister restored to life amen how many wouldn't that be wonderful amen to see that made manifest amen so let's uh let's bow our heads before we read our scripture master today we're coming to you lord thanking you for all of your mercy and your goodness and your grace to us lord where would we be without you lord what what could we do what could we hope how it lord if i didn't have this word my what would i do what would i what would i tell my children my grandchildren how would i have any hope to offer because the world lord is engulfed in destruction and burning down around us but lord thank god it is the rising of the sun thank god we have a real and living god he's the same yesterday today and forever and we ask you for your blessing on the service today and we ask you for our sick and afflicted lord that you remember them as we have named them out now as a saints of god lord as a family of god in the earth we ask for your mercy in each of these cases lord may you beautify it so wonderfully with such supernatural clarity lord that all would have to bow the knee and confess that jesus christ is lord grant it to us today master now help me as i come to your word lord we commit ourselves into your hands for service just now in jesus name amen amen and amen god bless your friends we want to invite you to the book of philippians chapter 2 amen and i'm you know i maybe give you just a little testimony just maybe it might encourage you you know i um we're gonna go to ephesians chapter two and this morning the lord woke me up a little earlier than normal i'm usually up around five and i like to be in my what i call my 5 30 chair get up get ready get myself oriented get in my chair and begin to talk to the lord i try to do that every day of my life and uh the lord woke me up a little bit earlier today and uh and i i felt pretty tired and so i felt myself drifting back off for just a little bit and lo and behold like like like i got hit by a thunderbolt something jarred me and said get up and i said okay lord i'm getting up and said well i'm thinking what's the rush and literally friends the spirit of god moved on me and said there are i'm here to answer prayer there were brothers praying for this service today now get up i want to speak to you in my word so you brothers who are meeting on saturdays to pray for this service let me tell you it's not going unnoticed by the lord and so and i went in and found it so the lord just began to i even was not even able i thought about might put a powerpoint together i wasn't able because the lord freshened up my notes to such a degree that i just haven't had time to do it and probably that's best so it'll it'll keep me uh in in the proper channel without getting sidetracked by a presentation i use them sometimes but i just don't really want to do it today ephesians chapter two verse 11 now we want to we we're taking our our eighth and what maybe uh i don't know that's always subject to the lord but it looks like this if i can finish it today it'll finish up my series on what is the church of god and and i i want to take as a subtitle today kingdom citizens amen kingdom citizens ephesians chapter 2 paul showing here that we are no longer strangers isn't that wonderful we're no longer strangers from the economy of god we've been brought into something friends let's look and see what it is verse 11. wherefore remember that ye being in time past gentiles in the flesh let me catch my place here um in the flesh who are called uncircumcision by that which is called the circumcision in the flesh made by hands that at that time ye were without christ being aliens from the commonwealth of israel and strangers from the covenants of promise a pretty dire situation what you agree having no hope my and without god in the world i don't think you could have a worse situation see but now in christ jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of christ for he is our peace who hath made both one and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us having abolished in his flesh the enmity even the law of commandments contained in ordinances for to make in himself catch it for to make in himself of twain one new man so making peace and that he might reconcile both unto god in one body by the cross having slain the enmity thereby and came and preached peace to you which were far off and to them that were nigh for through him we both have access by one spirit unto the father in that glorious now therefore having said everything i've just said now that you understand all of that now therefore here's what i want you to get ye are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens with the saints and of the household of god can you say amen to that so i am of the household of god and there's more but wait there's more and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets jesus christ himself being the chief cornerstone in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the lord in whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of god through the spirit my it's wonderful to be fellow citizens isn't it my we were foreigners but now we are fellow citizens with the saints and of the household of god you share the table with abraham you share the table with moses you share the table with the apostles in that glorious amen may the lord add blessing to the reading of his word you can be seated you know it's a it would be a fair question you know to ask why i've continued preaching on this series which now today will make eight full parts um on this series what is the church it's a fair question and and you know i i can only express to you what i expressed at the beginning of the series that you know when i looked at paul addressing each church in his letters we find that he would in every other church he would say things such as paul to the church to the saints that be or paul to those chosen or this this one and that but we find that in his letter to the corinthian church in fact his both times in his first letter and his second letter he emphasizes to the church of god at corinth and now i i you know there there was some natural affection paul considered the church at corinth his children somewhat above measure you can read it in his language and the way he talks to them he actually says that to them and so they were very dear and near to his heart and they were at times a troubled church and i think that paul was trying to get them to understand who they were and i think that that that in the knowing of who you are then that can inform your thinking on on on the responsibility that god is looking to for you to have that for you to bear and for you to say i will willingly take on this charge the apostle has said we are the church of god well that ought to mean something that ought to have uh an effect and it ought to effect change in our lives and this is where even brother branham talks about um you know when the bride can recognize who she is and in that recognition and it's not just hearing about it but it's you saying amen to it it's you it's it's a coming to terms with the fact that god chose you and put you here for a purpose and you're not going to get out of it as you've heard me say many times you're going in the rapture and there's nothing you can do about it god placed you here with a purpose with a plan and he wants you to clearly identify who you are because then that that can then make you feel the weight of you know brother branham tells the story from back in the slavery days how that here was one slave they didn't have to uh beat at all didn't whip him at all because he conducted himself knowing that he was the son of a king back home and though a prisoner though an alien though he had no hope of ever returning back to his home he still conducted himself in this world as a son of a king and so brother branham talks about the value of you realizing who your father is and what he has called on you brother branham makes a statement in why little bethlehem he says you know leaders sometimes go through things that the congregation don't know what they're going through when you and then he gives a little bit of insight and boy how i can relate to this when you think of promises god has made and then why don't it come to pass and they don't tell the congregation they don't tell the people they associate with but there's many flusterations in the heart of a real leader and you know i why have i been preaching on this series what is the church of god and i keep telling you and i keep insisting to you that you're part of part of a kingdom all right and it's in it's important to me that you that you understand that and so why have i stayed on it so long because i want you to see uh i i i i want to see and i want you to experience bondage broken from your life i want you to enjoy the glorious liberty that that day on calvary has provided now i can provide it all day long but if you never become a part-taker remember you say well i thought i'm a i thought i'm an heir of god you are an heir of god you came from god from the genes of god election is always origin but but paul talks about if you're only an heir you don't yet have an allotment see you're an heir of god but that that means that you there there there is an allotment but you don't have any part in it as an heir of god but when you become a joint heir with christ then now not only is there an allotment for you but you are actually partaking of that allotment just as jesus is reaching into the treasure chest of the father and pulling out every redemptive blessing you're standing right beside him reaching into the same treasure chest this is the meaning of being heirs of god in joint heirs with christ it's not a redundant statement don't ever think of it like that and so i want to see bondage broken in our lives i want to see sins grip on our lives broken how many want that see we want it in our marriages we want it in our homes wanting our children we're not here this isn't a social gospel our church isn't here we're not looking to just renovate a building and expand it out just to seat more people that that it would it would only take a few people see to bring the power of god it only takes two or three even and he's in the midst so what we're looking for is to have him in the midst however many or few there be i want him in the midst i want him to be glorified that's why we preach we're not here to lift up humans we're here to lift up god here to lift up christ and god sends forth his saints into the earth he sends forth his apostles and his prophets and we are built on the foundation that they have laid and you can't change the foundation once the apostles and prophets laid that foundation there's no room for another gospel see any restoration that is claimed as a restoration has to go back and reflect the original foundation and that's how you know if you've deviated off of it because it disagrees and when it disagrees then jesus christ is not able to be to demonstrate himself as the same yesterday and forever now he is but he can't demonstrate that in you because you're outside of the line in order of his word the whole purpose of being in the line and order of god's word is so that god can get behind your life so that god can get behind your word so that god can be an enforcer of your prayers as long as we have that understanding then the world can never successfully argue that he's not the same yesterday today and forever your life of obedience and surrender proves to the world that he is see and then the supernatural moves among us you know we can't help but believe unorthodox things you know uh when john came for running the lord jesus and john had a lot of unorthodox things to say and it caused the spiritual religious leadership of that hour to reject john they never did receive him as the elijah prophet that jesus said he was and we find that they didn't receive jesus as the person he claimed to be and he made no bones about it he claimed to be the son of god and so we we realized then that that he that every time a messenger comes from god to the earth then he's always going to bring unorthodox you know things that are unorthodox to what man-made theology you know uh has turned uh has turned the word into man-made theology turns this into something different than it actually is and so when god brings forth a messenger quite naturally that messenger is going to seem and appear unorthodox but he's literally there to bring god's family back to the faith of the original seed which then which then exposes that is not unorthodox he's original see he's bringing the original seed and and sometimes this this can bring you know uh trauma and brother branham talks about how that when a seal is open and a trumpet sounds and it declares a war see a spiritual war every time god reveals something out of his word it's a it's a trumpet when a revelation comes forth it's a trumpet coming trumpet from god now don't confuse it well there's various ways we can talk about the trumpets in the in the book of revelation but any time a revelation of the word comes that's that's a trumpet and it's god declaring a word and that starts a war starts a spiritual war and this causes pressure and and discomfort you know in the world and it even may say it even causes sometimes pressure and discomfort even to god's true family see because it always makes you appear unorthodox or unnormal if i could say it that way to the world in the age that you live in because it changes everything about you you're no longer you don't any longer go with the flow you're now considered unorthodox and and there they'll base their rejection on you of you based simply on the fact that you're not according to tradition even though that jesus warned that it was tradition that caused the blindness see and so so we realize that a lot of times it it makes our lives change and and people don't understand us and even our language changes your declarations begin to change and uh and a cry you know because a a a cry wells up within you to identify and and to correct the error of the day and it's not just in preachers it's in everybody that's a believer there comes an inability to just to just some at all times just remain silent you know there there's a there's a restoring word has come and you you can't be silent see and sometimes you you estranged friends and your estranged fellow workers and even sometimes your family members become strange to you you don't do it for that reason that's not why you do it that's never in the heart of a humble child of god see it's not about that see but but but but the word must declare itself and if i'm part of the word then i can no longer i'm sorry to my friends to my work associates to my family members who knew me when i was in sin i can no longer be that person and who i am now may make you uncomfortable but i can i cannot refuse to be this way it is now my all-consuming life brother branham referred to himself as the most misunderstood person in the world he says people misunderstand me he said they he said everybody thinks that you know that that i'm that i'm against everybody and brother branham says if they only knew i'm for everybody there's a man who loved people he said but i i got a message to giving he said i got to be honest with the world he said god put a message upon me and brother branham as a human being said i wish it wasn't mine i said i wish it wasn't mine he had i mean here's a man who'd already suffered horrible rejection as a young man god he you know rejected trying to get the love and approval of his dad got rejected as a you know god got rejected on the streets as a young man and and see people coming down the street and see him coming and cross the road because his family had a bad name and brother brandon would say well i never did those things but yet they would do that anyway said i could walk up to somebody on the street as long as nobody was around and say hey so and so how's the fishing oh billy the bluegills are biting down man oh yeah we and he said all of a sudden somebody walk up and they turn around like they don't even know me see and and and here's a man who who you know was was acknowledged by historians by uh religious historians the world over uh in fact there's there's no there's no history that that even says anything different than this that he was absolutely the tip of the spear he spearheaded the great revivals that he was the most prominent among them all and there is numerous history is replete with the testimonies of men who lived in that era which then completely invalidates people today more than half a century later trying to say otherwise and and i've never figured out which is dumber their claim or them trying to get me to believe their claim because i'm i'm a historian by nature i'm a student of history and when i go back and i look at the actual history how could i come to any other conclusion than that he was a sincere godly man who loved the lord and had the respect of many people and the supernatural is is is too too too much too large as i was in my bible study uh online this morning uh and and i was making that point now where brother branham tells the story so many times maybe a dozen or so times about the man who come to him he tells it again in the seventh seal said a man comes said i don't believe in divine healing there's no such a thing as that he said i don't believe in your divine healing and brother brown said mine well i don't have any oh so you're doing good not to believe in mine he said he says but god's is perfect he said there's no such a thing and he said you're too late to tell me that buddy you're too late buddy no he said you might have come back in another age years ago and said that there's too many thousands of people now you're way too late he said i don't care i don't care what sign you could believe well that you could show me i don't care what demonstration i won't believe it and brother brennan said certainly not it's not foreign believers it's only for believers see and so it comes to be believed if you don't believe it and you reject it then god will just let you go off into your blindness and and that's that then that creates the very sad reality of people in this hour who are who are blind according to the bible they're blind in this age and brother branham says that's the sad part is that here they are naked and and and poor and they're wretched and they're miserable but you can't tell them because they're blind now it's not a blindness of of no sight because it'd be easy to convince a man who has no sight he's blind sir you're blind yeah you're kidding really but but the problem is is like the pharisees when jesus talks about that blindness and they said are we blind also and jesus said well you know if you were then you'd have somewhat to stand on but since you say you see then your sin remains so it's not it's not like they don't have an image it's that the god of this evil age has blinded them with the wrong image and they're looking at what they think is god and they think it's his word and it's not and god doesn't stand behind it and god doesn't vindicate it but none of that moves him because they're blinded by tradition and they that's the that's the desperate place to ever get to don't ever set a pattern in your life you know of of doubting god whatever you do even if you can't understand it go away and say amen just believe it anyways listen friends your faith must go past your understanding your faith i'm gonna say it again has got to go beyond your understanding to believe that even if i don't understand it well then how do you know it's true because i know god and i know that's his word and i i don't understand how it is why it is how to happen what will happen i just know he's in control and i i will never disbelieve him i'll never disbelieve him and it causes us sometimes and you don't want to shy away from that i know it can cause pressure sometimes but you know that's not the motive of our heart the motive of our heart is always to enlighten those and to try through love to persuade them and becoming all things to all men paul said if i might win some and and you know it's it's there's almost no degree sometimes even even sometimes pastors brother makes this statement i'm glad he said it because i wouldn't had the guts to say it but he said sometimes a pastor will even he's trying to catch a young person and he'll wait out a little bit and people look at him and go whoa he's really kind of getting a little carnal there almost looks like he's gonna move into sin with him he said but he's he's just trying to grab ahold of him and pull him back to shore see i'm not here to tell you what that looks like when it happens but it happens amen and so you know as as i as i read the quote in the beginning pastors don't always tell even their associates and they don't they don't tell the church but things weigh on their heart you know you preach the word of god and you know this person loves the lord you can sense it you get around them you discern their spirit they love god they really believe it they really are they really truly are a believer but then why why can't they seem to get past the carnality of their life why can't they seem to get more serious and mature with god see and these things trouble your heart and all you can do is just come out here to this pulpit every week every opportunity you get and just declare it again and declare it again and declare it again and live it and live it and live it and declare it and live it and declare it and live it see it's not it's not up to me to follow you around or to walk up and down the aisle with a billy club that's not that's not that's not how we win the lost see and so god has to god has to do it and so you know when you see this kind of thing you can see it in the scripture john comes along i mean you know in in matthew 3 7 uh um zoey are you running the board oh okay awesome honey give me uh this is weird like somebody needs a haircut oh it's zoey yeah see a pastor's mind thinks too fast sometimes about let some young boy have it [Music] it's too pretty to be a boy you know okay so matthew chapter 3 verse 7 sweetie thank you you're awesome for those of you on camera that's my granddaughter don't i mean that's why i'm calling her those pet names so so we find here but when he saw him this is john when he saw many of the pharisees and sadducees all these denominational preachers come to come to his baptism and he said unto them old generation of vipers you talk about unorthodox old generation of vipers who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come now there there are you can go into the old testament and you can find some indirect references to individuals you know like this you know in in three or four places not really direct but but but but this but certainly certainly this is unorthodox in the sense that this is the first time that term has ever come to be attributed to an entire generation even in the old testament when it talks about you know in a kind of an indirect way of serpents and vipers and different things but now john is coming forth to to literally pull from fragment fragment pieces and john is going to now introduce a whole new concept to say i'm here to tell you you're just uh you're just a generation of vipers this is where you are it's not just a a handful of ungodly teachers your whole generation is in need of a wholesale uh reconstruction and that made john unorthodoxy and then and of course now you you remember that remember and i'm going to read it here in a minute or or i might i might not but remember that god has one goal remember that it's all about expression so you know we showed you that i think last time where when you go into the book of revelation and you find him coming you know in chapter 12 when the bride goes up and satan is cast down and then now the kingdom of heaven has only has god's family there and it says you know the the kingdoms have it's now the kingdom of of god and his christ so the father and and the and the son and now the family is there and then that's at the very beginning of the tribulation but it's not the language is gonna uh progress it's not gonna alter anything that's established but it's going to progress because by the time you get to the end of the tribulation and now the millennium starts to sweep in now the language becomes it's now the kingdoms of this world have become the kingdoms of our lord jesus and his christ his bride mrs jesus christ yes see so and by the time you get over to chapter 22 you've literally got the bride in christ speaking in the unified voice the spirit and the bride say see so so you you always want to look and you're seeing that here when you go let's get matthew 12 z when you get to matthew 12 34 now you're gonna see jesus people have people have a hard time why do you always quote william branham because he was elijah prophet well that's unprecedented oh really let's look and see if jesus what jesus does with it matthew 12 34 old generation of vipers how can ye be evil speak good things for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh now you've got jesus quoting his prophet and when the prophet said it it was unorthodox when the prophet said it was unfounded you couldn't find that kind of a connotation in the old testament but john was a messenger of the covenant and he comes to bring this and as soon as he says it now it becomes the word and now jesus starts quoting it see you see the progression see so so when we when we look at this we can see that there is a perfect and a proper furtherance in expression as jesus begins to pick up this new scriptural lingo matthew 23 33 zoe matthew 23 33 you serpents your generation of vipers matter double snakes your serpents individuals your generation of vipers how can ye escape the damnation of hell see and that that this is what rankled the pharisees and sadducees this is what this is why when he's there in the temple teaching about you know you're full of dead men's bones and men walk over your graves they don't even know there's walking over over a cemetery or you're blind and leaders of the blind or are we blind also well if you were then you'd have somewhat to say but because you you declare you make a declaration that you that you're the voice of god well then prove it prove it as elijah said let the god who answers by fire be god see and so let god demonstrate so so when we when we come if you look at john and this elijah prophet now it's interesting because the old testament doesn't declare john to be elijah and in fact is when john's asked about it he denies it flatly and you don't even get a clue that he was until jesus mentions it see in in i listen to isaiah 40 and 3 isaiah 40 and 3 the voice of him that crieth in the wilderness prepare you the way of the lord make straight in the desert a highway for our god see so so this is now historically speaking the application is israel is going to return from their 70 years captivity and so that when you study the hebrew on this third verse in chapter 40 of isaiah it's it's it's it's as if it's referring to you know highway construction workers who are who are called on go back rebuild the temple rebuild the walls and and and and clear the way in the desert for the return of the lord you exiles go back and get things ready the messiah is coming see and so so then so you know they're they're returning from uh returned uh you know to judah from babylonian captivity in 537 bc so it was it was the announcement of a kingdom coming and there needs to be someone in the desert getting things ready so when they asked john now there's a connotation between jesus and john and he's going to identify this that isaiah 40 and 3 has a connotation to john because he's here to prepare the way when you go to malachi 3 1. see behold i will send my messenger and he shall prepare the way before me and so you don't actually come until they ask jesus you know why do the scribes say elias must first come and jesus just gives a two-fold answer you know elias truly shall future there there will be a prophet from the future and he'll come and restore all things but i also say to you there has there's a partial fulfillment here and and he's come already and they understood he spoke of john see and so because you know because when you when you look at that you know all elijah ministries blend and overlap with meaning from the time of elijah the tishbite to elisha who who who stood in his who stood in his room and and you and you find that he he washed the hands of of the prophet and and the different things like that and then you come to john who denied he was elijah but jesus says if you can receive it if you can receive it this is he of whom i said i send my messenger before my face to prepare the way and and he said elijah's come already and now they understand that he's elijah even though john had actually denied that he was elijah see because any true prophet would deny that and so we find then that that when he comes to malachi 4 and 5 and 6 then this is going to be a calling to a new phase of the kingdom of god and now it's it's not you know they're ju just so you understand why we believe we believe there are scholars who look at malachi 4 verses 5 and 6 and they say it's all on john but just there are just as many take my word for it there's just as many other learned scholars with just as many letters behind their name as these guys who say no it's partially john but it also refers to a future elijah and i'm only saying that so that you know you're not somewhere out in the woods in the thicket with this this is this is widely accepted that malachi 4 5 and 6 has a dual fulfillment now where they make their mistake is is that they they believe that that future fulfillment is the elijah to come to the 144 000. and many of them believe that and then some say we don't know they they just didn't know they they asked arthur pink who was tremendous beautiful mind during that man age anointed to think that way one of the greatest bible teachers of all time as far as i'm concerned and highly revered and they asked him and he just said i i don't know he said well it's for a future time and god will interpret it when it comes see so i just want you to know you're not don't let somebody think make you think that you're just off the off you're just out of your mind that you're not out of your mind this is bible scholars who have thought this for for centuries and so but but but then say well then could it be elijah to which as a student of the scripture i say impossible it's impossible for it to be elijah to the jews malachi 4 5 6 couldn't be that because the whole point of malachi 4 5 and 6 is that there's to come and elijah to save a people from the tribulation from going into the judgment i'm coming to destroy the earth but i'm going to send a prophet see and and and we know that moses and elijah and 144 000 and the remnant of the woman's seed they all are martyred in the tribulation period but the bride has already gone to glory so it would have to be a gentile prophet dropping down in that interval of time between the sixth and seventh trumpet to call a bride that's why you have revelation 9 and it starts talking about the trumpets first second third fourth fifth by the time you get this is historical markers that's what the trumpets are by the time you hit the fifth trumpet you're talking about the prelude to world war one and then when that's over the first world war the first was over and then it comes to the sixth trumpet and that's the 200 million remember that demon chargers that bounty euphrates and they're going to be loose to go after hitler i mean loose go after the jews under hitler nikon right this is rudimentary stuff right and and it's and it's and while the fifth trumpet is being sounded and a world war one is taking place as i've said to you and given you this example many times because it adds such clarity and god is now removing the control of the ottoman empire so that his children can head back to the homeland at least get started and get out from under the grip of the ottoman empire and at the same time he's doing that under the fifth trumpet he's god is in a tree talking to a boy saying don't ever drink or smoke or defile your body because i gotta as this as these trumpets keep sounding i'm gonna have it work for you and then when you go to the sixth trumpet and now you've got 200 million demons being released then and then at the end of world war ii right at right after world war ii god has got that same boy who's now a man and he's in a cave and he's appearing to him saying i come from the presence of god to explain your ministry because now he's going to launch out at one born out of season he wasn't there when the azusa revival started and he's trying to tie it all together and bring him back to unity and that and that covers through chapter nine and you you don't get the seventh trumpet until chapter way over or past chapter 11 where moses and elijah are now bringing the message to the 144 thousand and so that they can have the day of atonement and recognize messiah and wouldn't you know it right in the middle chapter 9 and chapter 11 you've gotten 12 you've got chapter 10 because there had to be a mighty angel with a prophet on the earth to come down and call a bride and that's why brother branham said it would be in the interval between the sixth and seventh trumpet historically speaking see and so what is the seventh seal it's the coming of the lord and the beauty of it is we're not waiting for it to start the the revelation of the seventh seal is it's already underway what's the biggest evidence the mighty god among us what other evidence you got he's living in a people he's living through a people it's a shout it's a voice it's a trumpet and one day that'll bring the dead saints out of the grave and change you in a moment in the twinkling of an eye see so the scripture is just perfect and now we wouldn't have known any of that had it not been for kentucky hillbilly who happened to be a prophet who didn't know anything theologically but he he had enough sense to know i'll go back and find my types in the old testament and then when then when the lord brings me a revelation i'll see where the type was in the shadow i'll see what paul said and if this meets this meets this then i know i've got it and then he'd come to the pulpit and he'd give it to you then you'd have it and then as a vindication the pillar of fire would come down and we'd see the sign of the son of man year after year after year tens of thousands of times without a flaw that's impossible for a human only god could do that see so so we find then that that this gentile elijah would announce the season of the coming kingdom a millennial a millennial kingdom where where the kingdoms of this world would become the kingdoms of our lord and of his christ which is his bride which is mrs jesus so so god's messengers here's what's here's a great a marker to identify a true messenger of god god's messengers are always working on god's one goal expression they're they're not here to just teach you theology they didn't come just to interpret some you know some harbingers and and and and and signs of doom you know and and symbols you know apocryphal symbols in the book of revelation they're actually here to first identify god then demonstrate god then feed that god to you so that now the progression goes from him to him to you you understand and then you and then when when that happens then that middle prophet can go on home because because the ministry that we feed on was never the body word of a man it was the body word of the son of man and the ministry of the son of man is still in the bride she's the final voice to the final age see and so we find that that that that this messenger comes depending on the age that he's living in their message will correspond to that time it always will time literally intersects with prophecy and god's word for that hour is accomplished and the beauty of it is friends oh my goodness the beauty of it is satan can do nothing about it satan can do nothing about it satan cannot stop it he can't stop you he can't stop him he can't stop the word see and so so here then uh is is how that we're building this truth amen all right and satan that really he as you've heard me say so many times he's really just a great puppet just like in pilate's judgment hall even the events of calvary see satan actually ended up playing a helpful part in the accomplishment of god's will thank you buddy amen amen too bad you helped us thank you see he's a puppet and so he brings about god's will and you know you have to understand this progression so now i haven't come here today just to identify markers of history and where we are in prophecy those are elementary things to us the purpose of a sermon like this is is to get you to understand that if god made those steps then he's going to make the next step and he's making a step right now he's making a step in your life and that's what i want to get you to have your hearts and minds open to is that he's here to take the next step and what is his next step him in you living the word made flesh in the earth again that's what brings the dead saints from the grave and changes your mortal body see so so we find then that you know god is always you know taking the next step to get to a new heavens uh to a new heavens and a new earth so now it's it's and as i said last time it's the same heavens but with now with the redeemed family that's what the kingdoms of our lord and of his christ are going to be so new heavens and new earth you know are not a rescue package it has nothing to do with the political climate this is the new heavens and the new earth are not a build back better they're not even to make heaven great again okay praise god brother luther they're neither one has nothing to do with men this has everything to do with the word and the people who are here who have the ability to say amen to every word see so it's not a it's not a you know it's god's plan that he had in his mind before the world began redemption was always part of his plan you can see that in the word zoe give me genesis chapter one and uh uh start at verse 27 honey genesis chapter 1 and we'll catch 27 and 28. amen this is so weird and so so all right look at our scriptures so god created man in his own image i love that in the image of god created he him see male and female created he him and god blessed them and god said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea of fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth so brother branham comes here in christ is the mystery of god revealed and and he you know he he's going to talk about the expression of his preeminences but but let me let me read you the couple of paragraphs prior to it so brother branham says he's god's speaking to moses take thy rod god speaking that's god's word go out there this is christ's mystery of god revealed he said lord i told pharaoh what you said and he wouldn't do it and so god said take your rod god speaking that's god's word go out there and point it towards the east and call for flies and flies come into creation because he had a watch he had a prisoner that pharaoh couldn't pay off with nothing i hope you are impervious from the enemy's loot to being paid off i hope young people that you got enough love of the word of god not to get paid off by glamour and the enemy just give you a payment of fortune and glory or fame or popularity or a little bit of money make you somebody famous in the world and you sell out and every great you say well you know i mean all inspiration comes from god god anoints gifts and he's he doesn't he doesn't take things back he's not as the old saying an indian giver which is a disparagement of the white man not the native american it's the white man who who's the who he's like an indian giver gives it and takes it back and lies and breaks his word so so god's not like that as i've said to you before god doesn't wake up in a bad mood thank the lord we do he doesn't there's no wrong side of the bed for him thank the lord so so we find he says here that pharaoh he had a god had a prisoner that pharaoh couldn't pay off with nothing nobody else turned him no way he was a complete prisoner in the chains of god's word help me lord bound up only to thus saith the lord oh if god can get him some prisoners like that how many won't be convicts today if god can get him some prisoners like that my oh he says uh he then then now that's when he can express the preeminences you see he's got a man or the person see so this is male or female a person so that he knows nothing but christ you get what i mean congregation says amen see now that's secondly now first to express himself completely god in christ second to have the preeminence by this in his church which is his body the bride that's his second goal to have preeminence in you see till he could have the preeminence to express himself through them that's what this age is so drunk with is self-expression i mean that's why you have a youtube and a facebook that that's that's that's why you have you know ted talk and instagram and it's all so that people can express themselves and all of that expression is headed for a tribulation so naturally you you shouldn't be surprised if i warn you against that to say god is looking for his expression to live through you how how i would love to you know i'd love to see some young people who are determined to have facebook and take talk and all these kind of things i'd love for you to get on there and open up a bible and start reading and say i want to declare the love of god is in my heart today oh i'm going to tell you something friends they'd probably censor you and close you right down if you tried that but you should try it anyway see thirdly to restore the kingdom that's us to its rightly position that fell by sin by the first adam back to where he could he walked in the cool of the eating boy i got to hurry with his people talked with them fellowshipped with them and now catch the saying it's a strange statement and now sin and death had separated them from his presence and his entire expression see so in this fallen condition of our birth we can never reach the image of genesis 1 27-28 you know you're cut off from that that was his commission be fruitful multiply subdue have dominion over everything in the earth there's no way to come to that image in our fallen condition and this age can't bring you back to it again all of the religion that we have and all of the denominations and all of the movements and all of the satellite tv and all the podcasts none of that can bring you it back because it's all a mixture of god's word and manmade ideology and while that worked during the ages when god could wink at that ignorance he's come to the last time now and he's come to the end of the seventh age which is a time of the bride which is a time of thus saith the lord only and he's saying now the only way to get liberty is to receive all the word of god see this world is literally going i mean steadily i don't have to convince you of that this world is steadily going into madness more and more and more this world is steadily going further and further away it's almost like a uh like you've seen it sometimes depicted an astronaut you know who's gonna jump from one part of a space station to the next and and and you know he he misses the grab bar and he has no tether and you know he the la the last thing that they portray him the last thing you see you see him spinning and rolling helplessly and hopelessly and and he's just tumbling further and further and further into space and there's no chance to save him that's the world you live in it tried to make a leap and it missed the bar and it wasn't tethered to christ and it's just drifting further and further and further and there's no way to turn the world around see and so brother branham says here holy ghost seeds of the bible cannot grow in the atmosphere of wisdom you with me still is with me still man don't don't zone out on me because i'm going to take these last 15 or so minutes so he says holy ghost seeds of the bible cannot grow in the atmosphere of wisdom that kills every seminary in the country that knocks the holes right through them punctures them and the judgment flows in that's right it certainly does because the word cannot grow with wisdom worldly wisdom won't do it now there's a godly wisdom of course there's nobody's talking about he says eve was to believe the word as it was given to her that right amen giving you the opportunity to participate in the quote congregation says amen eve was to believe the word as it was given to her she wasn't to listen to anybody else say anything about it just the way it was given to her that's the way she was supposed to believe it now watch what he says look listen to the value had she done that there would have never been a death if she had believed that that's right kinda like jesus saying verily verily very truly see truly truly very truly and he says if she had a that's the way she was supposed to believe it then there would if she had done that there would never have been a death if she had believed that that's right now friends this being true how many believe that's true then then i'll ask you a question if we're going to be keepers of the word and if her abandoning of it caused every death or wouldn't have been a death had she stayed with it is that right then if we're gonna then that being true then why can't we speak the word of life to anything that death and unbelief has brought on us if if unbelief has brought death and troubles on us then why can't we take the opposite and take the word and believe it and speak to our problem speak to our sickness speak to our situation and you're not speaking wishful thinking you're declaring the word see this was the meaning this was part of what it meant to come out of her my people as i've said to you before come out of everything satan trapped you in don't live with the you know the wounds and the damage that life may have caused you i mean first of all you were born dying you can't get much worse you're born with a death sentence and as if it couldn't get any worse then people did things to you that made it even worse and then you did things to you that made it even worse worse and but i'm here to tell you that when you come to christ let it go let it go accept the freedom accept the liberty that is in the holy ghost speak the word back to that situation see because that's what god can get behind that if you're living your life in the line of his word then you have a right you're entitled to speak the word and the holy ghost who's the enforcer of it will will back it up see reclaim your rights as a child of the king brother branham says in the restoration of the bridegroom i'm going to read you some quotes quickly he said what is it enforcing give it back that's it that's what it's talking about restore it bring it back to its rightful to its right honor see and if satan has robbed you of privilege of being a son or a daughter of god we have a right this morning this morning this morning we have a ride not just in 1962 we have a ride this morning in this building in this service right where you're sitting to say give it back see if you're a son or daughter of god we have rights this morning by the holy spirit to enforce the claim of god and bring them back bring them back bring back my child bring back my marriage bring back my health bring back my peace of mind see don't let the devil hang on to stuff he's not entitled to it he's not entitled to it christ died for you and the holy spirit is here to give you the holy ghost and make you an overcomer and free you from every every possible thing the devil has ever held on your life if you'll accept it amen if he's afflicted you i'm reading this because i'm not here to give you a pep rally i can get you excited but i want you to know i didn't make this up this came from elijah see if he's afflicted you and made you sick we have a right before god to enforce the laws of god by his stripes we are healed amen bring him back turn him loose you're taking him out yonder of death and we claim him bring him back now i love that oh you got a wayward loved one why don't you just say in the name of jesus bring him back now not waiting another day not waiting another week bring him back now hallelujah friends that's your right that's your liberty in the holy ghost see that's the enforcement restore it i mean when i read this and if you go hear the tape brother branham talking about it in the restoration of the bride tree brother branham is he's i mean the these he's saying this with emotion this isn't just some dry teaching he's trying to get the people to understand the realities of the living god what's possible he said that's the enforcement restore it back to its natural condition again a man is sick baby is sick woman is sick they're out of their natural condition then we have a right to enforce our claim not our claim it's our claim because god gave it to us by his stripes we were healed he was wounded for our transgressions with his stripes were healed now we have a right to enforce that law and the law giver the holy spirit himself is here the agent of god to see that it's done that way what way according to the way of his word that you put on your lips but brother brown made a statement like this he said if you are afraid to claim it if you won't put it on your lips and make a claim and you're afraid to speak it he said then jesus christ cannot help you because he's the high priest of your confession see and so now see now the only way the only way he can work is when you let him work see you've got to believe there's a law he said oh if i ever get to my text there's a law that's a law given amongst everything he says now watch we have a law the law of life in us we don't you see you are made born a place here placed here in the body of christ the sons and daughters of god you don't have to knock down to the devil we got a law that's the law of the holy spirit the only thing you have to do the only thing the only thing you have to do is know how to let go and let god you keep fighting at it see it won't never work when you let go and let god that's all say how do i let go let go of you let go of all your dreams and your plans and put your life in the hand of almighty god let go of your pursuits and get yourself out of the way and let god come into your life and speak the word through you and then he'll enforce that word it's so beautiful in the scriptures brother ernie used to point out that god promises god promises two things that he'll give you a faith and then he'll give you a reward for having the faith he gave you he'll give me faith and then he'll give me a reward for having what he gave me i'm in i'm in i'll take that deal how many want that deal today oh my see see he says here now it's easter time i like easter yes sir but there's too much easter today on the easter bunnies and rabbits and ducks and pink chickens and pretty hats and new dresses that's not easter easter is resurrection restoring to restore back it's god's restoring time see listen friends this is your life he's talking about this is your life dead and ruined in sin and god's law is here to give you the right to enforce that to say death give way death give way you're gonna say that today whatever however satan's operating in your life just say death give way this is the spirit of elijah to make to make clear to make way to make a way for the son of god to come forth i want to make a way in my life i want to make it plain so that he can come and the one whom you seek shall suddenly come to his temple and we'll be out of here friends i'm going to have to skip some of these quotes i'm trying to finish in seven minutes he talks about the sun the winter takes everything down but the sunlight brings it back the earth went away from the sun went back out here that's the way the sinner does gets away from the sun the s-o-n see well this s you in when the earth began to come back and when it's out there death strikes it the winter kills every living thing it can kill out here and now when the earth gets back around the seed is laying in the ground they're frozen the pulp has run out of them everything is gone but there's a little life preserved and as soon as the sun gets back in position with the earth again then there is an east an easter there's a restoration up comes the flowers again up comes everything all that winter has killed the sun restores all that winter's death kills the sun of life restores he will restore his eden he will restore everything that death killed that's right now now the only way it can ever remain dead is let it lay in the wrong place see you've got to see to god but if you never bring it into the presence of god is this in the wrong place but if it falls in the right place it's got to come back to life again so god let us fall in the right channel that's right for a restoration and all that the winner killed then the sun restores returning of the sun that's where we are it is the rising of the sun that's what's happened in our day you're liberated from everything that that your sin person brought on you everything anybody brought on you everything you brought on you no matter what the devil has taken from you jesus christ in his open word today gives it back to you see it's yours death has to give up its dead to a resurrection for what a restoration what does it the sun coming that's god's

probably be a different sermon altogether but i want you to ponder what you've heard today because i i wanted to make my case out of scripture because i know you believe that i wanted to make it from the quotes of a prophet because i know you believe that see you could doubt me but you can't doubt what i've said today because there's no one who can say that i made any statement outside the line order of god's word i was very careful to only say what was authoritative to you today now buy your heads for me all over the building play whatever is your uh brother anthony bow your heads everywhere now now listen friends why your heads are bowed you're standing here still under the sound of my voice no one looking around all eyes closed please the enemy i want to say to you the enemy will keep taking things from you unless you stop him say i want god to do it brother branham said i don't have the quote here in front of me he said there are some things that god will not do he's waiting for you to do it i'm here to tell you if you're tired of being pushed around by a lying devil and you're tired of the ups and downs and tired of if you're tired of falling at your own at your own weaknesses why don't you raise up a hand to god to say lord i'm in i'm under your law today and i'm making a claim i'm taking back everything i'm taking back peace i'm taking back harmony i'm taking back my children i'm taking back love i'm taking back bodily health i'm taking back i i'm i'm rebuking mental oppression i'm rebuking depression i'm rebuking sickness i'm rebuking the lie of the devil over my family i will not accept it anymore today oh hands up are everywhere friends say i'm not done letting the devil write my schedule and write my script i'm here today to say it's the word of god now give it back to me give back everything that calvary produced in my life give back everything give me peace of heart peace of mind peace of soul oh let shalom reign over my life today father hands are everywhere all over the building and i i just felt lord that i'd hit that moment i felt your permission just to stop and stand the people up and to say who is ready to stand with christ and enforce the word of god to say no more will i give satan his way in my life no more i'm done with that i'm done with that i'm coming to christ today honestly and with my whole heart i'm saying lord jesus i heard him i heard the preacher today say that i can go free so i'm going free i've heard him say i i am already healed then i'm going to be healed i've already heard the word promise me that that these signs shall follow them that believe and i believe it right now lord i've heard that i can take a token and i can claim it i can claim my children i can hold it over my home and i can shake it in the face of the devil as a badge of authority and say now back up satan you back up because this is my heritage and i will not surrender it to you and i have more authority than you so back up granite lord today all over this live building here in the live stream across the airwaves may young and old man and woman alike lord may we just raise up our hands let's just raise them up to glorify god friends may we just be believers of his word today to say lord i don't know how it'll happen i can't imagine it's so twisted the scenario is so impossible but god specializes in things thought impossible i love that lord we love you we love your word we believe your word we're here as believers today lord i am a believer i have not read in vain i have not preached in vain i am not praying in vain brothers who prayed last night for the word to go forth in this service today they didn't pray in vain lord you stirred me unusual it was unusual you stirred me shook me quickly get up i want to talk to you move quickly and i was stumbling trying to get up and move quickly it's so rare i don't it doesn't come that way but this morning in the wee hours lord quickly come i'm going to talk to you people have been praying i'm here to answer prayer oh god this world is shaking down oh god all around us it's sinking sand madness on the streets coming and going it it pervades every facet of society lord there's no clean place no safe place only in christ only in the word we're here to believe it today and accept it lord god i pray master that you let it be just that real to every man woman boy and girl under the sound of my voice today or who might hear it at a later time today right now in this service right where you stand in this building are in front of a live stream right where you are right now we're making every claim to say right now i'm claiming every promise and it ain't even up to me to make it happen he has said he would make it happen if i would just believe it and claim it so i'm getting out of the way i'm surrendering all lord oh father so much so much more material i would love to have got to time didn't allow for it and i didn't want to i didn't you know my heart i didn't want to over tax the people because this was a big point i want the people to understand their liberty in christ it didn't come by accident it came by the purposeful plan of the expression of god and just as every word that has ever come to pass this word will come to pass we will lord go in a rapture the dead in christ from thousands of years will rise from the dead we which are alive and remain shall be caught up with them we shall be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye so today lord what are we doing are we making some some some unwarranted claims some lord is it an unsolicited claim no it's you inviting us to make the claim it's not unwarranted because it's in your word and we're claiming it today in the name of jesus christ every person that made their claim today however long their list was i am looking for the holy spirit now to go forward in my life and in their life and be the enforcer of these things now lord whatever it might take in my life whatever it might cause me to have to give up make me willing lord make me willing why your heads are bowed still please while you're in prayer he's not going to let me out of reading this quote to you i want you to listen to the word of your prophet from august the 25 august 25th 1963 in a message called how can i overcome with your heads bowed now i want you to listen [Music] if we are trying to follow the message of the hour or at least this part of the message we should live constantly in the life of christ now i want you to think about your priorities friends as i read this one think about your schedule i want you to think about what you give so much of your time to think about what you sit for hours and hours and you're involved with listen to what he's saying if we're trying to follow the message of the hour at least this part of the message about overcoming you want to overcome raise up a hand you want to be an overcomer how many see me too then we should live constantly in the life of christ because if it don't watch now if it don't you lay around and know that these things that you're supposed to do don't do it the bible said he that knoweth to do good and doeth it not to him it's sin then what happens you lay around then you become dodie rotten when you're separated from the life of god so strive with all that's in you to stay in the life of christ that you would be fruit bearing see as i said at the beginning you are born defeated and that birth can never bring you to life because you're born defeated you're in a defeated world amongst defeated people amongst defeated creeds defeated denominations you've got to come to victory some way see but the problem is so often we don't want to be humiliated that's the reason women don't want to their hair to grow out see the reason they don't want to dress like ladies should dress like men don't want to see it's the same thing they don't they get humiliated but jesus constantly look who he was look at his greatness i'm going to say something greatness humiliates itself great humbles itself that's greatness father as i drove across through the countryside yesterday listening to that tape it just overwhelmed me i just found myself saying oh god help me oh let my life be constantly lord let me be willing to give up the things that so distract me from you let me give up so much stuff that makes me lazy and dody and all i do is lay around and i know what i should be doing and i don't do it help us today lord help us to be willing to humiliate ourselves the greatest person that was ever could be great humiliated himself that's greatness but many times we don't do it because we don't want to be humiliated lord i want to i want to raise up both my hands today and say i surrender to humiliation i surrender lord if the world completely rejects me i want to be in the love of god i want my life to be in service to you lord i want my daily life lord to be pursuing your word i want my time lord god more given over to prayer more given overlord to fellowship with you less and less as every day let me muster a little less of the world and more of you prophet said as much as you can empty out of yourself then he'll rush in and fill up that place as much as you can empty out of the world he'll come in and fill up that place lord help us today this is why the word came lord this we want to have these rights we want to have this this enforcer the enforcer i can't enforce nothing but you can and you will if you're allowed to express yourself through me if my words of making a claim are not just vain words with no purpose behind them no plan to to humiliate myself and let god live in my heart then we'll make all the claims in the world it will be it'll just go it'll fall to the ground it'll never go anywhere but when you can have faith if our hearts condemn us not then we can have faith towards god to believe that what we've said will come to pass i commit it to you today lord now very good okay uh i feel relieved you wouldn't let me leave without reading that so there it is lord now it's on the airwaves it's in the people's hearts they'll do with it as they choose i commit it to you lord in this whole service today feeling as i've obeyed you in every step and done all i can do now lord we we we turn it to you we turn to the holy spirit we'll lift some hands we'll raise our voices we'll sing some songs to give you thanks today lord let your word move in our lives in jesus name amen let's sing a song or two before we go brother

you oh god we welcome your vision for this assembly we welcome your vision for what we have in front of us lord we want to have everything by the line and order of your word i want to have everything that brings you glory and honor we love you we declare it we love you we believe you committed to you now [Music] oh i trust you hallelujah don't you love him friends give him a hand this morning [Applause] lord [Applause] lord we thank you god bless you can be seated amen come brother matt and and uh brother matt's going to come and give us a brief update hasn't been good to be in the house of god today i want you to be able to take the word with your friends and we're sorry to change the order like this instead of giving you time to linger that atmosphere but that atmosphere should be in our lives all the time anyway amen and we uh we have some ideas and plans that we want to put to you and um it's preliminary and then brother matt's going to kind of give you where we where our thinking is there is still i want to say this so you don't run ahead with worry there is a ton of due diligence we still have to do to see if everything we want to do is even possible to see if the cost can be manageable but uh your trustees uh who you've entrusted to watch after you the church in financial matters they are in uh unison today they took a vote among themselves they were 100 behind this plan brother mark will express that when he comes up but uh we're going to need your prayers we're going to need your support amen because it's quite ambitious and i i i have become persuaded in my in in my way and kind of just i don't want to say it any more than that just in my way i kind of was to say well let's just do some cosmetic things but if you know i be i've become persuaded brother jason has become persuaded by all the team of brothers to say listen if we do that and we make it pretty it really doesn't still meet our needs not even now to say nothing of long term so we're now looking forward to something a little more aggressive brother matt i'll turn it over to you god bless you bless you i'm getting if you want to go to pull that up we had a um and not that one not that one nope the first one i showed you actually just stand by we're going to show those in order so we had a business meeting i know that you um sisters probably uh inquired from your husbands what that was about and i'm sure most of you have been made aware that we've uh we're going to move into the second phase of renovations for the property we started with the outside and uh i personally think the outside is beautiful and we have a just a quite a bit of a difference the night and day at the end of all the project we'll show you some of the before and after pictures that we have but it's quite an improvement to what we've what we had prior with just the block um now we have the beautiful outside and the new landscaping and some other renovations we did even to the fellowship hall some of that there's still as you can tell there's effects from that that are temporary such as the trim around these windows just waiting also the lighting we put in new lighting didn't fix the ceilings because we knew we were going to be going to the second phase which would be the interior renovation and so just to sort of show you how that has evolved we had a meeting and that meeting was just to talk about some improvements that we want to do to the interior that would help the interior match the exterior and the look uh that we're going for and so that meeting was largely covering the removal of this ceiling that you have above you above these beams and i'm a lot of this is repetitive all of it's repetitive for the brothers who are here um but above you is uh beautiful just raw milled wood and trusses that that hold the roof and the walls together and so we it's we wanted our idea was to open this up to vault the ceiling it's already voted but to remove this and you would see the vaulted ceiling and the expose the beautiful wood that they that they used when they built this church 1950s i think if that 55 um somewhere in there so when they built this property they uh they did a good job at just some of the the way that they they uh put up the trusses and the the the materials that they use are beautiful so we want to we also have had a need for a while with air conditioning when it gets uh hot this ac system is undersized and doesn't keep up with the uh the need that we have especially during the hottest months and so the idea was also to change that completely entirely since we would be vaulting the ceiling you would no longer have the space for you could run duck a ductile system but the plan was was is to use large commercial mini splits that would cool and heat the entire building and so may most of the business meeting was about the cosmetic things that we could do plus the air conditioning spray foaming the um the uh the roof so that we could have you know proper adequate um uh efficiency for our heating and cooling and so we we sort of started with that and when we talked amongst brothers we were ball parking just a general ballpark um the demolition of that new carpet also this carpet has seen better days it's done really well to hold up they carpet on the stage and the carpet that's in the on the main floor seating has done well to to hold up but we want to change some of the colors a lot of the woodwork that you see uh maybe uh we we would consider it dated and so we want to update some of that the paneling that's on the wall to take that out and drywall change the color so a lot of cosmetic changes we were ballparking that in the range of about fifty thousand dollars somewhere in there of which we are going to do a building fund and fund the church funded the outside and so we're going to do a building fund to fund all of the the future renovations we were looking at after phase 2 which would be the interior renault to be phase three which would be the fellowship poll and obviously if you've been in the fellowship hall lately it's packed even with just a third or two-thirds of the church there there's not much uh there's not much elbow room and so we've had a great need there and so the idea was to maybe expand that maybe to cover in the pavilion and to stick frame that and actually extend the fellowship paul move the kitchen there was a lot of ideas but obviously we were just focused on phase two after some conversation uh with brothers and and actually a lot of this is things that even brother mark carter and other brothers but the mark actually drew up some things and did some for the trustees and did some 3d imaging of that what it would look like with just toying with different ideas of adding the vestibule we need bathrooms in the front you know changing the fellowship hall maybe out of the building so there was all kinds of ideas but what we've honed down on is what we're going to do and i'm going to show you in this floor plan is to rather than just go for a small cosmetic facelift you could call it that why don't we solve problems because we have some issues that we've had here for a long time on this property such as bathrooms out here no bathrooms at the front you have to walk especially if it's raining it's real inconvenient sunday school rooms bathrooms the heating and cooling problem that we've had the stage is too small these guys are cramped uh up here stage is too small and even seating when we're when we have our entire church and we're packed in it's packed in nice and tight um but we we look to grow and the lord's there's families the church is going to be growing here over the next couple months with families moving in so how do we how do we accommodate everything solve some problems with our fellowship hall solve problems with office space and how the space is laid out currently right now and so um god sends the right people at the right time exactly the right time god sent brother steve and sister emily curtis our way and our brother steve has a profession in design designs houses and so uh he was gracious enough to give us some beautiful renders and concepts actual life like life-size so true to what it would look like because the program that he used he used his lidar on his phone to get an exact image and he took measurements of what the building space is square footage and then he put that in concept so the conceptualizing thing that you're looking at what you're about to see uh is the design the colors the carpet even down to the chairs everything is is life like what it will look like um when we're when we're done i want to just say also that this is a preliminary i'm i we just wanted to bring the church up to speed because there was a lot of chatter after the meeting what's happening so today is not the full presentation we don't have all the answers um we have a lot of logistics to work out that we'll be doing we do however have a team of team leads brothers who have agreed to lead up the effort we have different brothers and those brothers are here most of them are here today some are traveling out of town and then brother steve also has worked up these images uh and also on top of that he's worked up the the initial preliminary floor plan there are some things that can change and things that i'm sure will change you're going to notice that the fellowship paul want to show it to you doesn't have a kitchen and it doesn't have sunday school rooms so don't bombard the trustees or brother steve especially leave brother steve alone um tom bob if you want to come to brother stephen ask question come to me to save him from getting bombarded because he's come to me yeah come to the pastor he's simply drawn what we've proposed to him uh and designed what we've designed and so there's going to be a lot of questions and what if we did this what about this we're thinking about all of that and there's uh you know there's a lot of consensus based things i'm going to show you uh two different roof plans one is with exposed trusses one is with a um what would you call the second i'd say like a coffered ceiling yeah like faux beams coffered ceiling all white um so there's there's two different styles i'm going to show you here and then a really neat video brother steve put together um and so just going to show that at the very end i want to just say again this is preliminary it is the direction that we've chosen to go we're going to be doing a building fund um for that there will be a lot of fundraising for that brother ken boos is going to be leading that effort and he's going to be up here before you on his own discretion maybe weekly or every week basis just doing giving you an update on where we are with the fund um he's put together a document with a lot of good even scriptures i wish i would have read this morning didn't didn't pull him up and was gonna pull them up just things that the bible talks about in nehemiah when they put their hand when everyone joined in unison and put their hand and had the spirit of help and of labor and of work so we need your prayers we're gonna need your financial support to do it it's very beautiful i'm going to start with the dry part of this which is the floor plan just to show you an overview so you know what you're looking at when you see the render so pull up the floor plan gideon there you go and make that big and i don't have a way to control it just make it full screen make it full screen the green yep and then command plus we'll zoom it in if you could do that zoom in again again can we turn these lights out and of course all of them every single one of them stage lights and everything and then if you can use the up down left and right arrow keys again you can go up go down down there now up one stop perfect what you're seeing is zoom out one time actually getting i want to see all the outside walls here and we can send this so that you can have and look it up close man i wish i had a way to control this and i can't use a laser pointer so maybe on a step you have the wireless mic brother just an explanation here the outside walls that you see here this entire square just the rectangle square if you could yeah use the mouse and show just the square here going around that is the existing sanctuary that includes from that wall back wall all the way to the back wall beyond the stage to the offices that's the existing building we're not expanding that we're keeping the same outside walls that we have here that's not getting expanded what we are doing in and and if you just uh let me explain it this way and you understand the prints better this stage the stage wall is is gone so everything goes back all the offices in the back the pastor's study the bathrooms that we have back here everything is gone everything shifts this way which will allow room um to to put what you see here and zoom in here gideon on this uh this front area here just zoom in right right here um and go over go over this way go over this way zoom in again here zoom in again okay so what you're seeing here is the vestibule area come down this way nursery women's restrooms an area just a little a wall leading into that men's restrooms above you could zoom back out and so vestibule bathroom sound room cry room all up front and then the stage all the way to the back now you say what happens to the offices uh and you know and all of that well behind that is the um addition if you go that way gideon that way yep and zoom in on that some if you could you see that there's an addition um on the back in between the fellowship hall and the church now will be filled with a new addition plus an addition to the side that is down here come down this way so down here this is a new addition to would be over here um for the pastor's study go this way towards the fellowship hall and then zoom out zoom out now the current fellowship pole stops about right here stops about right there and so if you imagine a line going over that's our current size you can see we're removing the roof structure that we have back here and we're framing that all in and expanding extending the fellowship hall and even past that put in another awning almost like the roof structure but an awning that would go out uh beyond that and then there's restrooms also if you zoom in if you come up here to the fellowship hall area up here getting the very top of your screen and zoom in right here zoom in on this go over go over zoom in again so the entrance to the fellowship hall is here with restrooms we still got to lay out bathrooms etc um you're not going to see this in the con conceptualizing images you're just going to see the sanctuary that's what the con concept images are of but the floor plan shows that in in gist if i could just keep it simple the sanctuary we're not adding to the front some people ask that's going to stay what we're going to do is add a we're going to redo how we have the layout back there with the booth we're going to add men's and women's restrooms we're going to add a nice vestibule area obviously so i have a nursery and a sound booth there and then by doing this setup of this new sanctuary we add between 70 and 80 seats to this sanctuary so we're able to stay on this property longer so really the improvements that we're doing is maximizing the potential of this property without going overboard and over building it so if we were to grow to a 300 the seating will seat 192 is what the new sanctuary will seat if we go beyond that and we're in the 300 range the lord tarries and adds to the church well then we would the trustees and the church would just have to decide to sell the property buy something else but this is maximizing it to its fullest potential uh so you would have this stage all the way back we would the stage would increase in size obviously not in width but in depth would increase in size um you would have doors that come you could imagine doors even though stage is going to be rearranged that would lead to the new addition the back offices which is this area right here go over getting in this way uh that that is this area here with a new music room pastor study av room some bathrooms back there a hallway a way to get from the fellowship hall into here and then back and forth um and so uh that that is the general floor plan uh ideas with the additions that we're proposing now i want you to go to the second make sure i want to make sure i get the right one not the one with the white ceilings gideon you should have another document no no close that document entirely go to finder and then open up the second the next document give him just a moment to do that and then bring that up and slide it over um uh yeah that's it yep yep yep yep i think so keep going keep going over um okay make that full screen so this is just some images of the overhead view if i was back there i could zoom in and show this but i'm not going to try to do that now if you just go through some of the pictures go to the next one this is just a sky view the next one there that's looking from just a different angle and now this is the elevations this roof here that's coming on the sidewalk and to the front is optional this is just a concept like i said this is looking from if you're approaching from battery creek road going down mossy oaks road next next image that's the front of the church next image stop stop there that would be from if you're coming from reebok as you pull up next image this is um there you go from the school as you approach if you were to park over here this is the side you see the new addition for the pastor's study coming over and tied into the existing fellowship hall next next next you can see that there's a new awning from out from the fellowship hall it's not the existing one that's a new addition keep going there stop there now this is the image of the new sanctuary all the way down from the colors to the design this is the exposed trusses that we talked about um and so the what you see tying them in is cabling and hardware black hardware next image the view from over here go through it next and this is from wait maybe where brother steve is sitting now brother aaron uh next keep going stop there back there just want to give everybody a minute just to take in the beauty next image next and that's looking from the sound booth you can see the added seating it's beautiful beautiful uh next image there that's looking from uh right in this area looking up you can see the new brick wall the entire new stage setup and layout will be different a little different than it is now uh next if i'm missing anything brothers feel free to just to stop me if i'm missing any details you the church should know um next this is as if the lights you can see the cross that we have there's going to be lit it's going to be a lighted cross and this is this as if the sun had went down you're looking from the vestibule area to the left would be women's restroom a nursery to the right would be the men's restroom okay you can close that one there is there is also another one getting very much like that should be in there another document you could open just another pdf this shows the different ceiling we want to show that this is a different style make that large and you can just go through those pictures showing that coffer type still ceiling look a little bit slightly different and then glass i like that a lot better glass doors for the vestibule doors leading in and that's it correct now i just want to play the last thing is just a video make sure the computer is unmuted jackson if you could and has a little bit of volume because it has some beautiful beautiful singing to it sort of gives you an idea of what it would feel like inside of it i like how brother steve made this this is a video showing it's going to switch back and forth between the two ceilings options the exposed truss and then the coffer go ahead and play that [Music] move the [Music] is mouse favorite [Music] gift every day your presence is i think brother steve uh hey man steve did such a wonderful job amen on those i i told him i said the emoticon that has the the head that's exploding would be the perfect perfect one to use for that so i did a wonderful job on that so that's the update we can give you um as i said there's going to be more information more details to come that'll follow this we're going to be getting pricing that's just the floor plan preliminary plans we're going to need to mep the mechanical electrical plumbing plan we're going to need the demo plan we're going to need the foundation plan so there's a lot to get i've got to go to the city talk to them about what we're doing what we want to do um we don't know somewhere you know i would i would throw out a rough number of if the 50 000 was the facelift this is probably closer to 150. we won't know that number so don't don't ask us we won't know that number till we actually get hard numbers and pricing on everything and then when we have that brother ken will be doing a presentation on the fundraising and how to how to fund this so why don't you give the lord just another hand clap amen amen i got brother mark carter's going to come and just say a few words from the board of trustees amen um i just wanted to just reiterate what brother jason said what what our role as trustees is and and maybe tell you how we actually think about it when we're doing that you know our job is to represent you all and things physical material with the church the property keeping the upkeep and also any indebtedness keeping the church from many what we feel would be unnecessary indebtedness um of course ours is just four votes brother george brother charles brother john and myself we're just four boats just like you but we represent you like when we go to these meetings and um my mindset and i know the other brothers feel the same way we've discussed it when i go there there's people with a big overarching vision like brother matt he sees the big picture what we can do there's people that are very technical you know you could you can't do that because this won't work but i go there with the perspective of how it affects you how you would think about it even though i think of those things too you know it's um i try to put myself what the questions people will have so we are we do take that very seriously and when we go to one of the meetings we're thinking like you would think and i've had people come to me and say things like well it's you know what we got now works i mean it's all cosmetic what we're talking about doing do we really need it and um the way we're thinking about it um i think we took a poll here everybody would say that there's three things that we need i think it would be 100 on the bathroom so everybody would say we need new bathrooms um as far as room in here i mean on sundays it gets crowded there's even families i see them they can't sit together they've got to sit in separate parts of the church and then the fellowship hall um this is the things we thought about the fellowship hall when everybody stays you can't even turn around in there um every sunday it's a race between the ladies and the brothers to see who gets that good spot and we usually win because we eat faster so but yeah we considered all of that and um so we're in unison the trustee board representing you that this is a necessary thing we think that it's a good thing to do we looked at all the other avenues buying another place building from scratch and this is by far the most affordable and efficient way to do it and as far as like the cosmetic things yeah just doing them from scratch it's expensive but in the whole big project of doing those other things doing those things then it's a bargain you can usually do that for about a third of what it would cost if we just went in to try to do that so even though they are just for looks that's important and it would be very very affordable in the course of this whole big project to go ahead and do those things so i just wanted to give you our perspective on it and reassure you that we take it very seriously that wonderful amen so we you kind of have our ideas of where we're going to go forward and i just want to uh just to say you know and i made this um statement to the trustees this morning and to all of the brothers uh who uh brother matt has placed into team lead positions that i cannot as the pastor here i cannot become entrenched in a construction program i hope you'll understand that uh you don't need me to anyway we have very qualified men you know i i have a duty to give myself to prayer and the study of god's word continually for your needs spiritually along with the ministry team that god helps me with and a lot of them are going to be working brother matt will be taking the lead as he did on the outside i there's so many people that have helped on every aspect of it uh one second deb one second says uh and um it's really been a great group effort but i think that we owe an extra measure of gratitude to brother matt and sister rachel who really uh rachel was really my right hand man if i can call a woman that on design and uh and she's got a tremendous amount of leadership and influence on the inside of you saw many of our ideas we're still going back and forth on a few ideas but i just appreciate brother matt and sister rachel tremendously amen amen and so you know i'm sure it's no secret to you brother matt has served as my right-hand man to be my direct assistance to help pastor this church he actually pastored tucson tabernacle for a year so he has plenty of ample experience in it and will be i'll be looking to him to really take the reigns of this so if you have any questions don't call me amen bother i'm call him amen and uh and then if he if you if he don't have an answer i promise you he'll have a trustee or a team leader who will have an answer and so it's going to be a tremendous group effort the only thing that we we know for sure at this point is we want to do it now how we're going to do it and how it's all going to stack out and what it's all going to look like that's going to go forward and we're going to keep you in the loop of it i promise you we'll keep you in the loop of it and so don't don't think sisters that it's just a bunch of men going to design the looks we're actually not we're building the superstructure and we're gonna let sister rachel take the lead and she's got some ladies that have been helping her as well uh look and and don't bomb sister debbie amen so but there there are plenty of people who will be looking at this and sisters with multiple talents to help uh put all this together now as if all of that isn't enough i need everybody to go outside and be ready for a picture amen so we're going to dismiss sister emily and let her go out there so when you go out there you'll be confronted and i'm just kidding yeah she'll get it over the fast she's a she's a professional photographer and so she will get it over fast and then she'll be able to get that raw data to sister wanda and i had personally just wanted to keep the um the directory uh digital i'm all about saving the tree i'm not a liberal but just about saving the trees and and let's just make it digital but people had concerns with having their digital information on our website so we're going to go back to paper i'm going to acquiesce in that but remember to acquiesce means to agree to reluctantly so i'm going to give the go-ahead for a new paper directory sister wand has done that for years so we appreciate that let's stand to our feet and and uh we're going to be dismissed amen let's bow our heads father we thank you for this wonderful day that we've had and that we're having lord we just love you we love being part of your family we love being family to each other lord that is the over arcing feeling
