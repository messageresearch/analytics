happy to have you here bless you happy to have all you different ones here I'm sure I'm missing visitors but I do that all the time amen praise the Lord but to have you all in the house of God today um just a quick prayer request uh be remembering uh the Gonzalez family brother Michael and sister Wanda coming back in and I don't know who all of the family may or may not be with them um but I don't see any of the of them here so uh sister Wanda had an aunt passed away they had actually been in Florida the previous weekend and just have were getting back and an aunt passed away they had to go straight back so they're on the road listening and um we were hoping to have the um a good Stream So sister W said they are watching and so we just want to be in prayer for them for the family for the loss and for their safe return amen and hope their signal holds up good that's not always easy to keep a mobile signal when you're moving amen praise the Lord um want to be remembering a rapid recovery for brother Bradley today so happy to see him everybody turn around stare at him amen praise the Lord just so amazing brother Bradley I was sitting back there I was enjoying the Sunday school class and um I I I I put that on my announcement let's remember brother Bradley for a speedy recovery and I looked up and you're walking in front of me so that's got to be a sign from God Amen praise the Lord uh just a quick announcement brother we we didn't have it confirmed until yesterday brother Paula Fontaine one of my all-time favorite ministers in the message he'll be ministering for us here in December he'll be here on Sunday December 15 so mark your calendars and cancel everything else make sure that you come and hear him so he's G they're goingon to him and sister Rebecca are coming for a little bit of time away and um but I told him no you're going to have to work for food we don't we don't you better bring your preaching shoes amen so he said he would and uh he said he'll be happy to work for food amen um I want to say today how grateful I am I was uh uh had a an ability I was actually back there working and listening to the Sunday school at the same time I sure enjoyed brother Matt Smith's class today uh it was tremendous and is um conducive to the direction I'm going in today we're going to hit part nine of our series May finish a day we'll see no promises um but uh I was really enjoying it and I I made a note to myself to remind me to thank you because the the attendance has picked up and I'm so grateful for that we ask you to be more Mindful and try to get here early because of the value that we see in our adult Sunday school class it is it is getting good and good and good her and so you're going to want to be here for that and I just appreciated today all of the attendance that I saw it's not quite uh the full crowd but hey I get it uh but uh you're going to just trust me you're going to want to try to be here for those they're really really good all right um now let me let me switch gears now that I've got you smiling and laughing we might have to make you a little afraid so uh I want to just make a special note that we had um because of the rain and you all know the situation we have with our fellowship hall so we had a particular leak that created a very musty smell so I had instructed brother Charles to leave both doors open and to stay out there as long as he could and ventilate that so when we go out there for lunch it's not stifling cuz it was a rather stifling smell um but but unfortunately that almost like opened the barn door as an invitation for everybody to move in and out of there interrupting the children's Sunday school class that was active and underway sister Nita has taken up that mantle and uh and so we definitely don't want to see that that is um let me to say and this is a little bit of an inside joke with my family we're not talking about the video Booth but the Fellowship Hall is not going to be a youth hangout and my family will probably look at me and giggle over that because they know what that is but but uh Hey listen adults teenagers children parents with ch small children you know we really don't want to see uh and you really shouldn't have you know between our intermission uh all kinds of socializing out around here we're here for a limited amount of time and I'd like to see all the teenagers and little children and adults inside preparing this team works very hard uh to to conduct and make an atmosphere conducive to the presence of the Lord and i' just like them to know that it's worth it and uh we want to be in here doing our part to uh be in prayer be in the presence of God and by no means should teenagers or adults or anyone be going into the fellowship hall during sister Nita Sunday school class and I've asked brother Luther to enforce that strictly now so he's not going to reach out and kill you however he is going to enforce it very very strictly and so um so we're we're we want to have our hearts prepared and uh and our hearts and Minds prepared a lot of hard work uh goes on uh for the atmosphere here to be something the Lord can be pleased with don't just want to rush in and try to get your mind on the I mean it takes some time you know why CU you're a human and it takes you're not a machine it takes a little while to calm your spirit quieten your mind and be ready to enter in to worship so um we uh I I've asked brother Luther to enforce that we don't have a lot of Milling around and socializing outside prior to service starting and in between the intermission and by no means should anyone be invading the the fellowship hall during the time when the children's class is going on sometimes I get it you're bringing a dish you you didn't arrive early enough to get in there before it started I've made that mistake as well go in put it quickly go back out be as quiet as you can but try your best as I tell myself self you need to make sure you do that before the class starts amen amen amen turn around and look at your neighbor say we love brother Jason amen amen thank you ah so nice wow I heard that all the way up here praise the Lord amen so God bless you tomorrow will be Veterans Day I won't have a chance to thank our veterans and so I want to thank all of our veterans in advance and say thank you for your service and God bless you amen let's stand back to our feet and we're going to turn to he Hebrews chapter 11 this morning amen Hebrews chap 11 so hey don't forget to mark your calendar for brother Paul coming that's going to be a a really nice time brother Paul is uh just beyond wonderful and I probably have him for years have had him right at the top of my list of of ministry that really feeds me and I love to listen to brother Paul amen praise God Hebrews chapter 11 get to where I need to be and um now wait a minute I think I'm messed up um hold on guys um no I told you something different for my opening text let me get back to that Hebrews 9ine beg your pardon we're going to go to Hebrews 11 but for now we're going to go to Hebrews 9ine amen and we're going to catch verse 11 to 15 that's okay there we go Hebrews 9 11- 15 we're hoping today to carry on this would be the ninth installment in the series that we've been running and um the Lord being our helper uh this will be the ninth installment on the series opposing the Judgment of Heaven verse 11 of Hebrews 9 you have it say Amen so now really pay close attention to this opening text because I chose it on purpose and in the sermon we're going to circle back and revisit this briefly all right watch but Christ being come and high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect Tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered in one into the holy Place having obtained Eternal Redemption for us isn't that beautiful he he obtained Eternal Redemption for us and um for if the blood of bulls and of goats and the ashes of an hepher sprinkling the unclean sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh how much more shall the blood of Christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to God Purge your conscience from dead Works to serve the Living God Amen let's pray father we thank you for your word that's been read thank you for all the songs and the specials and Lord we're now looking to that all important part and Lord uh so we're asking you now to bless your word bless both speaker and he commit it to you in jesus' name amen I'm getting a little bit of feedback up here guys God bless you can be seated amen getting some um I can hear it just just at the edge of starting to feedback amen praise the [Music] Lord so the Lord led us in this series to close it out with a real thorough look at perfect faith and we've had an enjoyable time I've uh very greatly enjoyed your U your Keen attention and we're learning together uh the things that I believe that it's time for us to learn and these were things that brother Brandon in his language makes very clear in perfect faith and in not just perfect Faith but in other sermons where he would say things like now today I'm bringing you something that you're going to want to you're going to want to pay close attention to it and he would say because you're going to need it down the road see and so that prophetic insight and you say what was he seeing he might not necessarily have been talking about any specific thing but the Bible talks about how that prophets were often warned in their heart and they would cry out to the people the Bible talks about their when Jesus came in you know for his for his dedication and circumcision as a baby that that Anna uh she was moved by the Holy Spirit and Zacharias was moved by the Holy Spirit and so a lot of times sometimes prophets say things and I you know sometimes they're very clear and then sometimes you wonder do even do they even realize and I I have I think we're at a point where we can say without anybody having a coronary is that this message was Progressive to brother brandham as well it's Progressive to us and he would he would talk about uh you know he come to the end of perfect faith and here's another example where he says now I I'm trying to uh I'm trying to Circle back and I'm trying to come back in again with a fresh understanding to get you to see he says where you've had a faith but I'm trying to get you to understand perfect faith and it's it's it's countenanced in the in the thought of that that down the road and he actually makes the statement you know we're not exactly and and I'm this is in so many words you'll have you'll see the quotes here in a minute but in so many words he's trying to say we're we're not all the way there yet but we are going somewhere and you're really going to need this see and so I'm here to tell you that we're here and we've arrived and you're really going to need this see because this is an hour that is Darkness Beyond almost description the closest that the Bible could come is it would say total darkness covering the Earth and gross Darkness upon the people so we see The Madness of that is in society today and you're not going to fix it I don't care who they elected for president you're not going to fix it you understand because you know I I mean I I I'm glad that that that woke ideology took took a beating on Election Day I'm glad but but I didn't vote for either side cuz I voted for Jesus you understand but I I just want to remind you friends that you can say well you know the the best person got in I would say that you have no way to judge that but here's what you can judge God's person got in so let's just say God's person got in because regardless of which one would have won it neither one of them espouse the Judgment of heaven right amen amen they both oppose the Judgment of Heaven you understand so so we find that the word of God and and you can say well one was closer than the other I probably wouldn't disagree with that that's not my point I'm not here to to make a political supporting statement I'm just here to tell you that the whole world is in opposition to God's word and he knew they would be and he said they would be and they are be right and we're Witnesses of it so we really do need that word that brother brandham said you're going to need that going forward and uh we are here today so I can say to you today you need it all right let's have my um my presentation uh brother Mark and I will um I think I can take it over right here so opposing the Judgment of Heaven part nine which is just for those of you who may not remember it's a it's a very simple the whole theme is in that title that you would think that when the creator of all the world and all the heavens and all the universe and all the people and all the animals and all the air and all of everything cuz there was nothing and he made everything out of nothing then you would think that when God judges a matter and sends down a decree like we get decrees that come down from our Supreme Court they've judged a case and they've said here's what we decided you would think that when the Creator that made everything has has judged a matter and sent down his decree you would think that all creation would go yes sir amen thank you we'll get right on that but we have found that in the streets and in the government and in Social scenes they are demonstrating for everything God is against amen and and they are and they are demonstrating they they are demonstrating for everything God is against and they are demonstrating against everything God is for and we're not we're not we're not here to to you know we're not trying to make a judgmental statement but we're we're the bride is not an infant bride anymore this is a mature bride and we need to face these things and understand that you really can't operate like you did 10 years ago even five years ago I'm here to tell you you better not be trying to live in 2024 with the level of spirituality you had in 2023 and and in 2025 you're going to need to more of a spiritual experience not less I think that the Holy Spirit knowing that the tendency would be at the end time even among his family because Paul is talking to his family he's talking to God's family you wouldn't think God's family would need to have this said to them by the Apostle but speaking to God's family he says see that you assemble yourselves more as you see that day approaching it's obvious in that statement that the Holy Spirit knew we would have a tendency or there'd be an atmosphere or life would be too busy or whatever whatever I don't even know all the whatevers but but but there would be a tendency to cause us to pull back from that and the Holy Spirit is saying hey when you get there yeah amen because you're going to get there make sure you don't do that see so so we're looking then at the realization of what perfect faith is and and today by the help of the Lord I I hope to take us to what I'm just for lack of a better way to describe it it's just next level yeah amen and we've already covered quite a a lot of profound truths in the word of God in our study have we not well I hope you're buckled up today because this one's really going to push your limits all right but I but I've I've studied it back and forth through the message through the scriptures and it dovet Tales everywhere perfectly I've spent a lot of time talking to the Lord about it so are are you buckled in all right so we come to Hebrews uh 111:3 now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it the elders OB ained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear that is a mouthful so last time when we finished uh our our eighth installment we were we had you know Peter we found Peter sadly turning his attention to the circumstance that was around him he was operating perfect Faith he was violating never law of physics you can't walk on water that's impossible in the natural right but the Supernatural is not bound by the laws of the natural Universe you understand and so what so he at one point he is following the word he's got his eyes on Jesus he's hearing the word of God and and Jesus is saying you know as we said Jesus didn't say go get pray up Jesus just said he said Lord if it's you bid me he said come that was it Peter didn't go he did he didn't he didn't need to go pray as we said he didn't need anyone to pray for him he didn't need a prayer line he didn't need all of these things he because he had his focus on the word of God and all of the circumstances which were around him were dire but there was but but and and just when he stepped out of the boat they didn't get greater or lesser you understand basically what your understanding is is that the circumstances didn't matter amen when you're following the word of God here's perfect Faith the circumstances don't matter they should not have a voice in your head but it was when he turned his attention to the voice in the circumstances oh my and then the and then he began to leave the Realms of the Supernatural and he began to come down as I said last time Satan uh helped Peter come to his senses amen and that's the last thing you need to have happen to you is come down and operate by your human senses which brother brandom said we're not given to you they were they were only given to you to contact this world they were not given to you to lead you spiritually we have a sixth sense that is in the word of God and it ignores all human reasoning and and and circumstances it doesn't look at them and so so he effectively Peter Peter not Jesus Peter himself effectively hindered the supernatural flow uh that uh that had G that was operating in him from the words of the Lord which was not bound by the law of physics and so so there is so then there is today as we closing out last time we're making this point to you that there is an ever increasing challenge that we see today as that great day of the of the Lord now the day of the Lord don't ever forget in the Bible the day of the Lord is Judgment Day I'll send you Elijah the prophet before the great and Dreadful day of the Lord see man the Bible talks about in The Book of Revelation they will they will wail because the day of the Lord has come see and so so we realize that it's in the day of the Lord coming with judgment that's the time when the bride hath made herself ready oh my friends and so we find an ever increasing need and an ever increasing challenge as we see that great day approaching where you you may not have the time to go get prayed up or or brother said you know you wouldn't need a prayer line you're you're facing a time where you might can't get to a prayer line it's not a as we said it's not a Prohibition on a Prayer Line it's it's simply saying that you need to be operationally at a level to where you wouldn't need that if you couldn't get to it to where you wouldn't need to go get prayed up because your life is constantly in a Channel of fellowship with the holy spirit amen we found that perfect Faith isn't a power coming it's here now and the secret is to stay prayed up amen now let me let me let me add a little bit of definition to that to say prayed up that's almost just like a vague statement but it is to it is further to organize your life amen today amen organize your life today in a way that allows you to live tomorrow in that rich communion with Christ amen and you know what your job will be tomorrow is to prepare yourself for Tuesday to live and you know what your job will be on Tuesday to prepare yourself for Wednesday so you prepare your life daily you constantly Die daily you read your Bible daily you pray daily you fellowship and this these are all part and parcel of one great plan uh that comes from God with it with and it in its point is to instruct you how to overcome am see and so this is why we we showed you that brother bram's platform for perfect the operation of perfect faith is he preaches how can I overcome so it's all about organizing your life which is exactly then so then ex that's exactly that process is exactly what Satan will do and try to interrupt amen I mean what do you think he would do if your strength is in Daily preparing your life by by being in prayer and in your Bible and in fellowship and talking to the Lord and having a relationship amen you understand so I mean do does a does a does a a human marriage survive very long if there's no effective work on the relationship and there just two ships passing in the night you tell me that that marriage is headed it got married on this street corner in Vegas and it's headed for a divorce on that street corner in Vegas because there's no there's no they're just two ships they're too busy there's no building there's no nurturing there's no caring there there there's no there's none of that interaction and it's the same in the spiritual between Christ and his bride if you want to have perfect Faith operating in your life and believe me you do if you love your family you love your children believe me you do then you do those things which which which grow the relationship between you and the and the and the person of perfect Faith amen amen CU perfect Faith's not a gift it's a person now I've just jumped ahead of myself but that's where we're going next level all right so this is exactly then what what Satan moves to disrupt and too bad that we we go along with it come on Amen we go along with it we we allow distractions we get too busy we the the our church attendance slips our Bible reading slips our prayer life slips our fellowship slips it's almost like we prioritize everything about life and just push those down the priority chain and I just say that we break that cycle I say that we raise up young people who say I'm going to break that cycle we're looking to go in a Rapture we're looking to see the dead saints come back and it's imminent so we come away from the world and we turn our Eyes Upon Jesus more and more the darker it gets so at the end of the day Satan's ambition Satan's plan is not hard to figure out friends uh it's to get you to allow the cares of this world to break your fellowship ship your daily fellowship with the spirit of God it is the ambition of the Holy Ghost to lead you into greater depths of Fellowship that is his ambition and and and I and I and I just say it like this that the operation of perfect Faith um is just that simple because it's a person it's not a gift or an emotion it's a person and we've learned that perfect faith is tied directly to your level of relationship with God and your dedication to him in your life see because remember that perfect Faith as we've already defined is the mind of Christ remember it's not just merely faith in the Son of God but it's actually the faith of the Son of God the faith he had let this mind which was in him be in you let it operate in you like it operated in him how did it operate in him first of all he had no condemnation in his heart he did all that which always pleased the father amen amen secondly he knew who he was he he was able to identify himself in the word both of those you have access to you have and I know that that that if I if if you could live the preceptive sight of the word perfectly then he wouldn't have needed to do it on your behalf I get it we're humans we're you know he was in a a word created body we're in we're in under a sex birth and so our our even with the new birth our our sin nature remains but that's why brother Brandon preached before perfect Faith lest it put too much on you he would say here's what you got to start with how can I overcome so that makes sense to you I can see it making sense to you see so so we find then that brother brandham says this all right watch he says in the message it is the rising of the Sun as people today are trying to say we should so see th th this is this is and and all these underlining places are places that the Holy Spirit had me to underline to comment on because I want you to know that people are trying today people today are trying to say we should wash feet once a year on Thursday on Friday we should take communion and all different doctrines of they argue about see so they argue about nonsense and and but that's the spirit of the age everybody's got a everybody wants to argue everybody's got their point and if you don't agree with their point then you're out of something whatever you might like to be out of their something whatever see so they argue whether it should be this day or that day see this is this to me is where we have been talking about how that the argument against prayer lines is a silly argument and brother bam is trying to deal with that here watch now watch watch how this goes as people today are trying to say we should wash feet once a year on Thursday and on Friday we should take communion and all different doctrines of they argue about whether it should be this day or that day or whether it should be a Sabbath day or the first day of the week all these things are just merely Tradition now watch what good would any of it do you whether you had lent or not lent if there is no life in you amen see amen so what do you think Jesus was talking about in Luke's gospel when he said in vain or Mark's gospel in vain do they worship me teaching for Doctrine the Commandments of men didn't deny they weren't that they were trying to worship him but it was pointless see he says what good would any of it do you whether you had lint lint is a Catholic thing that they do uh preceding uh Easter and uh and but what good would that do you if there's no life in you it's only a memorial which there's nothing against it but they have certainly carried out their Traditions but left off the main thing see now watch this and and and and I had a very good friend a trainer that I was working with a Serbian guy and so we were fast friends I told him about all my travels over there he respected me as a minister and um he was um he was he was Orthodox and very devout Orthodox Catholic Eastern Catholic not not Roman he was Orthodox and um he he observed lint and he did all these different steps but yet I could see and I and I was able to get just enough uh enough of the true word of God dropped into his heart I hope someday he was a very wonderful friend of mine ended up finally moving away to another state and uh but it it made me sad because I could talk to him about the real life of God and you could see that he could he could see it but he was he was he was befuddled on how do I get there yeah and he he he kept always doubling back to I I do lent I do communion I take the Eucharist I I'm in a church I'm a I I Believe In Christ and all these things I pray to the Virgin and and all of these different things and and and you know it it's it's it's hard it's hard on our hearts when we have people that we love and they have certainly carried out the Traditions amen they go to church they sing songs they read bibles they've carried out the Traditions Jesus ran into those religious people in Israel and he said you you but by your Traditions you've made the real word of no effect and so brother Ram says they've carried out their Traditions but they've left off the main thing watch this Satan doesn't care how religious you are how right you are even in your Doctrine see if you miss that life you won't come up anyhow no matter how religious how good how many churches you've belonged to or will belong to it doesn't matter what one thing unless you have been born again amen so there's nothing that you should value above the baptism of the Holy Spirit and however we got to facilitate that whether we meet here two times a week five times a week whether we have special meetings youth weekends youth camps prayer lines singing whatever we have to do I want to see you filled with the Holy Ghost not here to argue a Doctrine why I want to see you filled with the Holy Ghost see so I'll use any and all means see so so do you see friends why I say that arguments against prayer lines is silly so what it is is that Satan is just using that to distract people yeah see it's not about it's not about whether you went in a prayer line it's not about whether you shouted or or you didn't shout or you went in a prayer line or you didn't go in a prayer line it's about do you know him and the power of his resurrection do you know him we often quote it and and brother brandham quoted it both ways and we often say to know him in the power of his resurrection that's actually not the scripture it's do it's to know him and the power of his resurrection because when you know him you're born again but are you living an overcomer life do you know him and the power is the power of his resurrection moving through your life I'm not talking about have you had the Holy Ghost are you born again you you've got to start there but then God is going to build you up you're a li you're buildt of lively Stones you're the Temple of the living God's presence see amen so is you know when you know him in the power by the power of his resurrection then uh brother Matt was dealing with that today the the token is certainly on display you certainly are living above the lukewarmness of the age for sure if you're you know if you're hanging out with the and you're you're mingling with the with the spirit of of leoda then I'm not here I can't judge whether you've been born again or not but I know this you're not overcoming you're getting overcome see and you just need to own that and ask God to help you so so we find then that when we read our text all right I'm going to back up to it or did I yeah okay I'm G to go to it right right back here again now Faith is the substance of things hoped for all right so in the jfb uh commentary which is one of my favorite commentaries uh Jameson faet and brown this word substance it actually substantiate it it substantiates Promises of God which we hope for as future in fulfillment we come and we pray we ask the Lord for a certain petition and then we're told to believe that it will come to pass right and so it so but but what this substance that Greek word substance is trying to get you to understand that the way you're supposed to believe for it is not just believe it in the future but you're supposed to make it a present reality now that is exactly what brother brandham taught so I know that that's accurate because the when you've got substance Faith that's perfect faith when you've got substance faith and as we've said it's the mind of Christ flowing through you unhindered amen see and so it's not you deciding anything it's you as a vessel being led by the Holy Spirit Prophet talks about those those Apostles say you know why why did they you know why how is it that Peter's Shadow healed people how is it that prison doors opened how is it that this and that happened because they brother Bram said they were so in tune with the Holy Spirit many times God didn't even have to speak to them just nod his head and off they'd go amen that's how that's how in tune I I can relate to that as a father a lot of times in a crowded room and my boys and I need to get an instruction I didn't always need to speak I could have a certain look or a certain nod or a certain you know a certain motion and they already knew because they knew me they live with me you understand and this is this is how you live an overcomer life when you have that kind of Lifestyle so the whole point of of substance faith is that it literally in your mind mind makes what you hope for as a future fulfillment it actually makes it a present reality they go on to say the whole thing that follows is virtually contained in the first principle now the first commencement of the things hoped for in us through the ascent of Faith which virtually contains all the things hoped for so in other words there's nothing that you could desire from God's promise that you can't have because in that word substance is everything see amen now let me let me show you why that's true and I'm going to get ahead of myself but I just feel I need to make this point look at what it says faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of thing not seen verse three for through faith we understand that the worlds were Fram by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear wait a minute I I thought God created the heavens and the Earth well this is almost a con a conflict wait a minute you're you're saying that through faith we understand that the worlds were framed I thought God did it so the only conclusion you can have is substance is a person because the Bible's not disagreeing with itself it is substance Faith or as I'm saying to you perfect faith is a person it's a reality of the person of Christ operating through you Jesus said to his disciples greater than this shall you do cuz I go to the father what's the significance of that by going to the Father the atonement could be made and that that body laid on the altar as a Perpetual sacrifice and that life sent back into the church so that you are now the Contin continuation of the ministry of Jesus it's now the word made flesh living in the Earth again see so this is what I'm I'm I'm starting to Peck at that now watch because we're seeing it that it's by the Elder by this substance this Faith which is a substance that the elders obtained a good report by it by this substance through this Faith which is a substance we understand the worlds were framed by the word of God see so so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear there's no one can do that but God he's the only one with the powers of creation that's why your new birth makes you a new creation old things are passed away and behold Al things are new amen you with me see so this is why you know so then they go on to say so through faith the future object in its beginning the future object in its beginning is already fulfilled amen amen now we're thinking on a different level now you're going to have to go beyond the Realms of of of Na of nature right and we're going to we're going to help you in a minute so this is why brother Brandon would say to his audience that if Jesus Christ was here on this platform wearing this suit he could not heal you that's a Mindbender okay you just mean like a figment of Jesus no Jesus himself in person the one brother r saw in a wheat field and the wind was blowing His Garment he said if he was standing on this platform wearing this suit that I'm wearing said he could not heal you he would simply say to you child I already healed you 2,000 years ago see friends we're going to a whole different plane of reality here you got to stop thinking of your life as linear it's like like I'm praying for it now and I hope to get it in the future the hope you have is that you have it now and all you're doing is watch as your faith is persevering no matter what the circumstances are to bring the reality of what already is in Christ so in the Old Testament days it only had the strength of the blood of bulls and goats and that's why I took you to Hebrews 9 because Paul said look he said if the blood of bulls and goats and the ashes of a he sprinkling the unclean sanctify through the puring of the flesh how much more shall the blood of Christ who through the eternal eternal spirit now catch it the eternal spirit now remember that verse 12 had said to us neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy Place having obtained Eternal Redemption so you didn't become a son or daughter of God when you nailed at an altar you found out you always had been and all you now come you've come to your Eternal Redemption that you always were a part of this is the plane of perfect faith it has to start with knowing who you are and to stop let the devil telling you uh you're something different you're a failure you're too weak you are too weak you don't have enough but in Christ I can do all things but I make mistakes of course I do but the blood of Jesus atones for my mistakes if I sin I have an advocate with the father but I never break my eternal connection Hallelujah so it's an eternal Redemption it's an eternal that they which are called might receive the promise of Eternal inheritance if it's if it's an inheritance that you can get on a certain day and lose it on another day then it's not eternal you understand so this is why Jesus would say once you've passed from Death to life you never come into the Judgment because why because you've passed from Death to life amen all right now that's that's almost Elementary to where we're headed I'm going to have to help you because we're going to say some things that are going to challenge your mind and so I'm going to have to base it on what a prophet made clear that this and of itself you've read it before probably and it is mindbending watch excuse we got to get down to it here here we go um right here semeran Church age now pay close attention watch carefully now and see this before there was ever a speck of Stardust before God was God because God is an object of of adoration and no one was there to worship him and so he was at that time only potentially God only potentially an object of worship nothing was worshiping him yet but he he says so and and so he was uh so he was at that time only potentially God and he was known only as eternal spirit so he was the eternal spirit see he wasn't like a something of an of a less than God he wasn't worshiped so he's only he's only potential to eventually get to worship and adoration but he's already absolutely God start to finish and he can't he can't even get any better or any less he can't increase or diminish he's everything he would ever be yes only his plan was that he eventually would become an object of worship see so he's known only as the eternal spirit the bride was already in his mind yes she was she was and catch it I've got it I've got those two words underlined already in his mind yes she was she was existing in his thoughts amen say well thoughts okay that's not a whole lot it's it's going to get better it's going to get good okay so you were in his thoughts and what about those thoughts of God they are Eternal are they not you agree with that the Eternal thoughts of God let me ask you are the thoughts of God Eternal if you can see this you will see many things see if you can see this today then you'll be able to see where we're going after this quote is over amen all right God is unchangeable in both Essence and behavior avor he's the same yesterday today and forever God is infinite in his abilities so therefore he as God must be omniscient so I'm here to tell you he already knows everything about you that's what Boaz said to Ruth it's been fully shown me all that you ever did I just say he already knows everything I ever did he already knows that my what my heart will love him he already knows I'm a Believer he knew that before said before you were born before the earth existed before there was Stardust he knew there would be a me and he knew there would be a you and he knew we would sit in this building and say Amen to his word when no concept of creation even existed he already knew that that's how real you were amen if you can see this you'll see many things God is unchangeable all right God must be omniscient if he is omnition then he is not now learning nor is he taking counsel even with himself man I'll tell you what you know I didn't I didn't really expect that brother or sister to do that man they broke my word I'm gonna have to think about this I thought they love me I got their name in my book I didn't see this coming I'm so glad that's not true I'm so glad he sees me inside and out outside and in he sees my past he sees my future he sees my heart he sees everything and he knows no matter what failure I have I'm never going to not believe his word because I'm a part of his word if he can add to his knowledge then he's not omniscient the best the best we could say is that sometimes he will be sometime he will be but that is not scriptural he is omniscient so he doesn't need to watch you he's not here today saying now I know this world I tell you what that teenager I saw what they did last week I better uh I better say something here I better I better reach out and do something he's not learning you didn't show him anything he didn't already know so I but if you only knew my secret fears I'm glad I don't but I'm glad he does and you should be glad he does He's Got The Whole World in His Hands friends you understand that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever you want him to be that Hallelujah people that resist that astonish me if that's not true I don't stand much of a chance see watch he has never had a new thought about anything because all his thoughts he has always had and always will have and knows the end from the beginning because he is God thus the thoughts of God are Eternal they are real am they are not simply like a man with a blueprint he has drawn up and which one day will be translated into substance and form you get that brother Steve the blueprints aren't the building see but it doesn't actually exist it's only on blueprint see but they are God's thoughts are all already real and eternal catch it and part of God so if you're the thought of God what are you you're part of God so then what is substance it's a person what is perfect Faith it's a person what are you the people of his choosing that the person wants to live through so this is why Peter should have never looked at circumstances this is why he should have kept his eyes on Christ see watch part of God all right that's actually in the quote I just put it on the screen to capture your attention so how see how this works everything we've just said now let's see how it works you ready God always had his thought thoughts for Adam if Adam fell that was in God's thoughts amen whatever the serpent did whatever Eve did that was in God's thoughts footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord Brother Brandon would say people say Jonah disobeyed the will of God he said I always take up for old brother Jonah he said because he was a prophet of God he said he he was never out of the will of God and when I read that I scratch my head and I go wait a minute hold on the Lord said go here and Jonah didn't he went there how is not here going there he gets credit for going here and that that's not what brother Brandon was suggesting brother Brandon wasn't saying you're crazy for thinking he was simply saying that it's all in the thoughts of God and nothing's out of catering God already knew it and already had a specially prepared fish to accommodate Jonah's unbelief I'm glad he had something to accommodate my unbelief I'm glad when I go in the opposite of his Direction he's already got a remedy for me Hallelujah God always had his thoughts for Adam Adam as his thoughts was yet unexpressed you see what you just read God always had his thoughts for Adam Adam as his thoughts was yet unexpressed Psalms 139:1 15- 16 will give you a little idea of this here it is my substance was not hid from thee when I was made in secret and curiously wrought see uh in the lowest parts of the earth Thine Eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect see I wasn't I wasn't even in the earth yet you already saw me I'm in the earth now so are you look around and say you're in the earth God already saw everything you've ever been would be and what you are and and you say well I I hope to get perfect so do I but God already saw this person unperfect not yet fulfilled I I know I already don't look perfect believe me I beat my own self up with that all the time that I I want to be perfect I know I already know I'm not perfect but I know that he knows I will be because why it's already happened it's already a reality stop thinking about Einstein it's already a reality Christ was slain he was the lamb slain not 2,000 years ago that was only an Earthly manifestation of what had happened before the world was form brother brandham said you're already on the other side this thing's already in God's mind it's already wrapped up we're already shouting on the other side no wonder I feel like shouting here today I've heard from my theany and it's influencing my life to love God's word why because over there it loves God's word hallelujah Thine Eyes did see my sub yet being unperfect and in thy book all my members were written this guy hasn't even been born yet all my members were written which in continuance were fashioned when as yet there was none of them do you think for a second and if you do you'd be wrong so let me say it like this don't think for a second that however he was going to be perfect he was going to become what God ordained and nothing when he got to the Earth and began to live there was nothing he could do to interrupt that amen nothing there's nothing you can do God trains us God chastises us God corrects us I'm here to tell you something friends but nothing can separate me from the love of God that was in Christ Jesus doesn't matter height nor depth fear famine sword Peril nothing can separate me and and if nothing can separate me then me can't separate me and you can't separate you this is the next level friends this is where perfect faith is operating that you're not hoping like oh I hope something will come to pass if you believe God's promise see it as already done put put the future in your past and just say I already he have it see that's what Abraham did and his body obeyed his confession so so so so he says here he goes on that as I said was not written about Adam but it gives you the idea and knowledge that the thought was there in his mind and that thought was eternal so I thought about that for a second I underlined it because it blew my it cooked my noodle blew my mind I thought wait a minute so the whole thought of the whole thought was already there which this didn't get said Till Psalms 139 but it applies to Adam before he was ever born so who's on first uh but he but he said but I thought did it become true no it had always been true it didn't matter that it was thousands of years before it God said it was always true you see friends it when you're on the other side it doesn't matter how many years it doesn't matter what happens when you get there you were always going to be there Hallelujah you're a believer of the word CU you always were going to be a believer of the word so the whole thing comes down to getting rid of your human reasoning and that's why you need fellowship with the spirit of God that's why you have to have that relationship to keep you out of the way because you're the interference right see Peter was the interference to God's word performing not at first but it became became an interference see so he says here and that thought was eternal and had to be expressed so when Adam was formed of the Dust of the earth and his spiritual being created by God then Adam became God's thought expressed and those Eternal thoughts were now manifested that doesn't change just because Adam sinned amen you know why it can't you know why because it's Eternal yeah and eternal can't be altered God can't get a new thought about you every thought he's ever had he's always had and will always have and God can't change his mind about you see all right so we're we're way in the next level watch and those Eternal thoughts were now manifested so I am the manifested thoughts of God watch brother random goes on down through the centuries we could go we find a Moses a Jeremiah John the Baptist and each one of those were God's Eternal thoughts expressed in its season see uh so listen when Moses lost his cool and smoked the rock a second time did he suddenly step outside of God's Eternal thought of him of course not you know why not because God's a a a nice fuzzy feel-good gentleman but because Moses was a part of his thought and God couldn't change his thought and and you think you when God made the promise today David and David committed heinous sins I mean really bad we're talking about adultery with another man's wife a very noble man and then had the man murdered and then covered it up yeah amen but God had promised that he would set a man on his throne and establish it forever through his seed did Jesus come did so so it wasn't broken no matter what David did that promise was not broken Jesus came and did exactly through the line of David what God said he would do and nothing David could do could stop that oh Hallelujah I read in the Book of Revelation that there was a great group of people saying hallelujah and that's you and that's me and there's nothing there's not enough devils in hell you me all of us together we can't stop that this is perfect Faith perfect faith is a person it's you in a the operation of perfect faith is you in a relationship am you with close close relationship so that your mind is clean and clear of carnality and the world and worldly thinking and your conduit and the Holy Spirit can then flow out through you perfect faith has never been you trying to have Mind Over Matter that's human Faith that's just human faith that's not as I've said to you before brother brandom says now you've had a faith I'm trying to get you to see a perfect Faith you're going to need this in the hour we live in today you need it see so so it's not you trying to have mind over matter it's not I mean even the whole part about we cast down vain imaginations those are all the things we do we do that so we don't hinder the word we bring every thought we're humans born in a sinful body and we're still in a sinful body so we have to bring our sinful thoughts subject to the Holy Spirit you know why so that that doesn't hinder the flow because that's the operation of perfect Faith perfect faith is a person the operation is when that person can flow through you according to his own will and fulfill his Eternal Word and when it gets fulfilled and it's then it's an eternal manifestation that can't be reversed when you have passed from Death to life yeah that can't be reversed see so he goes on all right so he says um down through the century we could go we find a Moses a Jeremiah I already know I won't finish today it's all good we find a Moses and a Jeremiah a John the Baptist and each one of those were God's Eternal thought expressed in its season amen then we come to Jesus the Lord he was the perfect and complete thought expressed remember the book of Colossians calls him the express image amen see no man hath seen God at any time God is invisible he's a spirit no man ha seen God at any time but the only begotten of the father ha declared him so we we we had no way to know what God was really like until Jesus came and now God is living as a human if you ever wanted to know what would God be like if he ever became a man just go study the life of Jesus that's what God would be like and that's what he wants you to be like see so he says he became known as the word he became known as the word that is what he is and forever will be amen and see how far I want to go yeah now it says that he hath chosen Us in him all right now let me go back to this again he's already explained to you how he's done this all down through time he did it through Moses he did it through Jeremiah he did it through Adam he did it through David until then he comes to Jesus you see do you see the process he's been he's not new at this he's been doing this for thousands of years he's been securing his family regardless of their weaknesses he's been putting the devil in his place no matter what king or emperor tried to circumnavigate God's word it would it never worked it never will work Satan cannot deceive this en time bride cuz she's predestinated to not fall say well if we're restored back to the original Church why did they fall because they were supposed to because the seed had to go into the ground and die they already had it abstract they already had the token they were already on their way to the Rapture but the seed had to to go into the ground brother random said it had to to fulfill God's plan CU that was his plan that they without us could never be made perfect so they went into the ground because that was ordained of God but God still saved his family it did not stop his Eternal Word but at the end time we have a bride who are ordained and predestinated to not fall but to actually go all the way to a body chain say oh I I'm going to get a body change because that I'm going to get all this kind of power to break the laws of physics I'm going to speak to storms and create squirrels you might do all the above times 10 or times a thousand I don't know it don't matter here's what I do know that I have passed from Death To Life here's what I do know that I am saying Amen to every word here's what I do know that I am or ordering my life in the line and Order of God's word cuz I know that whatever's outside of his line and order will fail because it has to fail it's not Eternal the prophet said so we are here today why are you at church to be taught how to line your life up with the word of God and and let go of the carnality of the world so down through he go he goes down he shows all of this being true and so now with that principle in mind now it says that he hath he hath chosen who us us in him you know it doesn't say he hath chosen us because he picked the best people he hath chosen Us in him I've said to you before the 42nd chapter of I of Isaiah declared there is only one elected son and that's Christ how did I get elected because I was in Christ he was expressed now I'm expressed it was his turn now it's your turn the word is made flesh again in the earth and God's whole plan is for you to be able to operate not a faith but a perfect Faith because that's the one that'll bring the sleeping Saints for hundreds of years out of the Grave he hath chosen Us in him Jesus before the foundation of the world that means that we're right there with him in the mind and thoughts of God before the foundation of the world that is almost too good to be true amen amen but he's he's stating the obvious he's stating the obvious if he hath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world did he do that does the bible say that that's true that's what the Bible says he hath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world and we believe that well then if that's true then that means that we were right there with him in the mind and thoughts of God before the foundation of the world and that gives an eternal quality to the elect you can't get away from that tomorrow when the Devil comes with his brags just say I was in him before the foundation of the world and you can't get away from that but when the devil says but you did this and you did that say but I was in him before the foundation of the world and look at the Devil and say you can't get away from that and you're not going to pull me away from that I'm a Believer in the word of this hour and that proves where I started that's what Jesus said all that hear my voice have been taught have been taught of my father have been taught of God Mark 6 so this is where the reality of it comes down to so now when we look at Faith being the substance now we come back full circle and I'm going to take my last eight minutes you good amen more to say but I'm just going to stop right here because this is this is heavy so my substance was not hid from thee I'm I'm sorry now Faith is the substance of things hoped for all right the the evidence catch it now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand understand that the worlds were formed by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear so I'm I'm not can I say it like this before we go off the air today thank God that in Christ I don't get graded on things that [Music] appear because if that's true I'm finished that's right you might not see it but when I when I stand in the mirror I see it when I look in this mirror I really see it and you do too come on you do too not one of us are worthy of this friends not one of us earned it not one of us deserved it and you couldn't deserve it or earn it but we that is that is a Superfluous point the pro the the fact of the matter is I was in Christ before the foundation of the world and that's why I'm a Believer I've already operated perfect faith when I accepted the word of God for this hour and receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost why would I not go in the Rapture I've already op I don't never get to perfect Faith you already are perfect Faith you already are functioning in perfect Faith by saying Amen to every word and even the parts in your life come on let's be honest even the parts in our life where we're ashamed of we w't want anybody to know but I'm here to tell you God says listen child all I need you to do is get closer to me get closer to me uh Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus look away from the world you can't do this God is the one who will do it all you can do is live a life like Christ did and do always that and surrender Christ surrendered you know what he's start you know the first thing he surrendered was he laid aside his crown he laid aside his royalty he laid aside his robe and Paul said he this was a being who had no problem saying I'm God I'm equal to God same thing and yet he took upon himself the form of a man and became sin for the whole world if he was quite confident that he could get himself out I promise you he's quite more than confident he can get me out and he can get you out aren't you glad for that today let's stand to our feet friends I'm so glad for that today I'm so glad that he already knows As we sing the song He Knows My Name amen he knows my every thought he sees each tear I each tear that falls and hears me when I call amen we should probably sing that brother Kenny he knows my name amen oh oh my goodness I I I'm I got to stop CU if I take the next step really wow great minds think likee it'd already sent that to the booth praise the Lord amen he knows my name are you glad for that friends now listen I want you to absorb that Satan I today I have given you not everything there's still a lot more there's other levels I want to reach but now I've got your mind thinking Next Level now you're realizing wait a minute hold on this is this is actually a little bigger than just me coming to church and praying more am the the stakes are way higher than that the consequences the blessing is way more than that we're not just talking about you lining up your life to a set of rules and Rags this is about you understanding that you are a part of the Eternal framework of God's mind and that he actually saw you here and here you are and you're a part of his eternal thought and therefore God is looking to you to manifest his Eternal Word not a man-made word not a denominational word that could never reproduce The Life of Christ the Jews tried that Jesus pleaded with them you'll never do it that way all you are at the end of the day is you're a grave that men walk over and they don't even realize you're full of dead men's bones you're just a a seler and people walk over walk right in here thinking they're gaining eternal life and their worship is vain but there is a fountain that has been opened there is a the mind of God has been released because God released his mind in this day because it was going to take more than man-made religion to get us out of here it it's just too dark it's too evil it's too Wicked it's too deceptive You' never be able to figure your way through all the mindfield of of what we know as Leo deia no way you'd never be able to accomplish it you'd never be able to find your way home had God not come in this hour and brought to us a revelation you'd never see it you'd never be able to find it this can't be something that is just students comparing verse with verse Prophet said it's going to take someone a messenger with prophetic Insight it can't just be students comparing verse with verse we've had that for 20 centuries see you love him I love him friends let's bow our heads before we have brother Kenny sing all over the building bow your head Lord I commit what was said to you today I commit it Lord to you what was said to these people Lord what is what I'm trying to in my heart and trying to as best I can explain it in a way that it draws a picture Lord that is a that it's a word picture that people can see what it actually is and not only what it actually is but see the role in it and how to interact and how it works and what it's all about we see who we are what we are we see why we're here we see what we're to be doing but Lord all of that aside it's going to take courage it's going to take courage in adults today it's going to take courage in teenagers to be willing to say I will take the way with the Lord's despised for you I will go the way of the word I will not be swept away from the Earth when the world is and the and the and humanity is swept from the face of the Earth in a tribulation I'm not going to be a part of that I'm going to secure myself in the Holy Spirit I'm going to say Amen to every word not just on my lips but in my life from My Heart Lord I pray you grant that grant that power grant that resolve grant that determination into young men and young women older men older women married single male female Lord grant it to us all we commit ourselves into your hands today because we believe you sent this word and we're Believers of it father we commit it to you in Jesus name you love him amen let's sing some of this song before we go amen sing it for

I love the meaning of Jehovah Gyra and when Abraham had really no way to even fulfill the command of God he had to lean on Jehovah Gyra he he had been given a commission like you he had been told what to do and what to accomplish the problem was he he had the wood he had the fire but the sacrifice this is an issue this this ought not to be happening there's got to be a better solution but in obedience he just kept walking he just kept walking and when Isaac questioned him he said Son Jehovah Gyra the Lord will provide do you believe that friends we're walking away we're walking in a way that seems sometimes impossible we know the commission we know we're headed to a body change we know that it is our relationship with Christ in the Capstone that literally brings the dead out of the Grave for hundreds of years it seems impossible amen sometimes If we're honest although we might not want to admit it I'll admit it on your behalf sometimes you go from day to day and wonder how will you ever get to that position yeah you do oh yeah you do yeah you do you know how I know you do cuz I do amen amen but I know this he's Jehovah Gyra and you say yes that's right the Lord provides well it it doesn't just mean that it does mean that provider but it means when you when you take the whole definition of Gyra it means that Jehovah sees and will see to it say I don't know how I'm gonna Jehovah sees it yeah but my family Jehovah sees it all but my sickness all but this problem Jehovah sees it he'll see to it he'll see to it he knows my name he sees it you you believe that friends
