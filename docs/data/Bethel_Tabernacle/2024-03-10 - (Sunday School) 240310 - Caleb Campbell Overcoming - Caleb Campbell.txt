========================================

that the Book of Revelation speaks of it's just it's a spirit on the age so even when you're born again of the spirit of God you still have to actively fight against that spirit amen because it's Waring against each of us talking a little bit about overcoming you know you'll never be an overcomer unless you have the Holy Ghost that is a solid Firm Foundation you can't be because it's Jesus who overcame death hell and the grave so it's through him that we overcome Amen brother Brenham he makes it so clear in some of the quotes we get into he says and how can I overcome uh a pretty appropriate sermon for this he says the Lord Jesus an hour and 15 minutes ago standing trying to take your word he's he's just speaking to the people he's Lord Jesus standing here trying to take your word and explain to the people how to overcome you told us how it's done and you did didn't only tell us but you showed us how it was done you led us you showed us how to do it to receive the word inside of us and be sure to hold that word it is written in every temptation but be humble walk humbly now and I wanted to pin this here watch this here he says then we have com conquered through you through your power which has already conquered our enemy and the only thing we have to do is just walk humbly with faith believing that and our Badge of identification of the Holy Ghost and Satan has to move so we have a badge of identification and it says to even be an overcomer you you have to have that Badge of uh of identification and that's the very thing that you yield to the devil when he comes in your life and says you can't do a certain thing well devil I've got the holy ghost in my life and he already overcame you so therefore I can overcome based on what he's already done amen it's already a work now I'm just living out what the Lord has told me to live out in my life now you have to blend that perfectly with brother brandham describing overcoming in the last day and how God doesn't want to push us through a pipe we and we come out the other side as Overcomers you're going to have tests after you're born again you're going to have trials you're going to have Temptations in our Christian Journey but the scripture we read this morning is greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world Amen who is he he is the spirit of Truth the Lord Jesus so young people old people anybody in here if you're struggling with something in your life if you have temptations you seem you can't overcome just ensure with everything you've got that you have been born again of the spirit of God Ure that you have the go holy ghost that you've been regenerated because you'll never overcome those things without that solid foundation but once you have that now you have the badge of identification and I think that's something that we ought to be concerned about a brother had come to me uh after I did the first part of this Sunday school um and was just talking to me and mentioned something that really struck my heart in this matter you know there can be indifference in our lives when we go to church there can be different indifference in our life when you know towards a brother towards a sister we there can be indifference in our lives towards many things which is you know what a lot of my material is on but one thing that creeps into our lives is being indifferent towards our brother and our sister in in church or being indifferent towards our brother and sister when you know in our Natural Life um it's it's I found this quote when he when he was talking to me about that and I thought it just was striking he says in brother bom says in the commission 1958 that's what the world is hungering for and that's the reason that the rest of the world isn't coming into the Pentecostal belief as we have it is because it's our own attitude towards one another that's truth Brethren it's because of our indifference towards each other they see one talking against the other one one against the other this against that and this denomination and they're scared of it you know and if Satan can't seem to get into your life and and you're reading the word or coming to church then he's going to try a different approach he's going to try a different avenue he'll start what he'll start doing is he'll start magnifying the flaws and the failures in another brother or in another sister's life but that's a trap and the Bible says that we need to know all of Satan's devices we need to know his tactics we need to know his tricks and you know if you if you become indifferent towards your brother or your sister by definition you're lacking concern for that person and you're doing the opposite of what the Bible teaches the Bible says to pray for one another if any Strife is among you fix it uplift one another amen 1 Thessalonians 1 or 1 Thessalonians 5 says wherefore Comfort yourselves together uh if you want to put it up 1 Thessalonians 5:1 wherefore Comfort yourselves together and edify one another even as also ye do so edify one another that's what that's our commission and and we beseech you Brethren to know them which labor among you and are over you in the Lord and admonish you and to esteem them very highly in love for their work sake and be at peace among yourselves now we exhort you brother and warn them that are unruly Comfort the feeble-minded support the weak and be patient towards all men now that that's that's incredible that's an incredible statement we have to be patient towards every one of us you know we're not all at the same position in our Christian walk but God is trying to get us to that place we're all trying to get into our maturity Amen in into our into our place where God wants us amen and so we have to be patient towards all men and rather than when you see a brother fall when you see a sister fall pray for that person uplift that person if we you can find and I've got the longest list you can find a fa flaw or a failure in everybody and everybody has them and if you focus on those things then it takes you down a rabbit Trail but if you focus on the good things in their life you focus on where wow you know this brother this sister was at this point and now he's at this point blessed be the name of the Lord you uplift that c person you admonish that person you you encourage them and you be patient towards them and support it says support the weak Comfort the feeble-minded you know sometimes we all have times in our life where we feel weak or we feel feeble-minded but when someone and I this is just an example in my own life I was just you know in one of those mind battles in a day and just feeling discouraged and I got this text message from you know someone who just really en it was just an encouraging text message and just as little something as little as that someone admonishing someone Someone uplifting encouraging you that can really change the atmosphere in a situation so when you're going through something or when you have someone on your heart and even if you're just praying for them maybe you know reach out to him and say I'm praying for you God bless you you know it's such an encouraging thing to see in church those things matter those things are supporting the body amen so uh verse 15 says see that none render evil for evil unto any man but ever follow that which is good both among yourselves and to all men Rejoice ever more pray without ceasing in everything give thanks this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you quench not the spirit despise not prophesyings and then it says prove all things and hold fast that which is good as abstain from all appearance of evil now God gave us lips he gave us words to speak those things were for creation he gave us those things to admonish one another to esteem one another to to glorify God that's what he gave us those things not to talk down about a brother not to find the flaw in their in their situation he gave us those things and if we see those things recognize recognize those things as evil excuse me recognize those things as evil prove it prove all things and hold fast to only that which is good if it doesn't agree and line up with this then lay it aside 2 Timothy 2 says this is a bible study this morning so 2 Timothy 25 and 16 says study to show thyself approved verses 15 and 16 study to show thyself approved un un to God a Workman that needeth not to be ashamed rightly dividing the word of Truth the next verse but shun profane and vain babblings for they will increase unto more ungodliness so the more you do something the more you talk about somebody the more the the more that it'll increase into more ungodliness you start having a good atmosphere God will start to feel welcome in that place and then it it'll good increases good but evil increases evil and that is an evil thing Ephesians 4:20 uh let's see Ephesians 4:29 I think is what I have if you want to go to that let no uh corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth uh go to 29 I'm sorry bro verse 29 let no corrupt communication proceed out out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edifying that it may Minister Grace unto the hearers now if you keep this at the Forefront of your mind anytime that you are talking with somebody or about somebody think about it and say is this ministering Grace unto those that are hearing this is it is it ministering Grace to them is it going to is it going to bring them closer to to Jesus is it going to glorify God in any way and if it's not then shun the very appearance of it James 4 says uh James 4:7 submit yourselves therefore to God resist the devil and he will flee from you draw nigh to God and He will draw nigh to you cleanse your hands ye sinner uh cleanse your hands Sinners purify your hearts you double-minded be afflicted and mourn weep let your laughter turn to mourning your joy to heaviness humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord he shall lift you up and speak not evil one of another Brethren he that speaketh evil of his brother and judges his brother speaketh evil of the law and judges the law but if thou judge the law Thou Art not a doer of the law but a judge Hebrews 10:22 says let us draw near with a True Heart in full Assurance of Faith having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water let us hold fast the profession of our faith without ra wavering for he is faithful that promised and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works so you think of provocation you think of provoking someone to do wrong but the Bible says to provoke them unto love to provoke them unto doing good works and we're going to get a little uh you know more in depth in this in a few minutes but you know it's a gradual process that you can begin to take you know if you have a thought against a brother or sister this opening one of the opening scriptures is you are to take everything cap every single thought captive in the name name of Jesus Christ confess that it's not your thought the Holy Spirit brother brother Jason preached on that the holy spirit will take care of that thing but if you don't if you don't then you begin tolerating that thought and that eventually leads into embracing that thought I'm going to we'll quote this probably the next Sunday school but John Wesley says one generation's Toleration leads to another embrac another generation's embracing it and now that can happen in your own life in your own thought process you you begin to tolerate something and then eventually then more things more thoughts then you begin to embrace it then by embracing it out of the Mind speaketh what is in the heart amen so then you begin to speak whatever is in your mind towards that person and it all began to not be because you didn't take that thing captive you didn't you weren't in obedience to the word I have this note in here for it says it says for young people but everybody in here don't we can't fall in into that trap you know you hear you hear someone being talked about in a negative way display Christ in that situation don't focus on flaws or the mistakes or you know or something in a negative way encourage encourage them build them up build the character up you know like I was saying it's easy to find faults it's easy to find failures in people we've all got them but greater is he that is in me than is he that is in the world Amen and we're were to look past the Fallen nature were to look past that Fallen condition and not Embrace young people you know especially if you know you just hear you hear conversation you hear someone being talked about shun the very appearance of it don't you be be Christ in that situation you know Express express some find something encouraging to say about that person and then shun the very appearance of evil you know um the Bible says being in one mind and one Accord and it says that a lot and it's something for the entire body of Believers old and young alike um with with just the little time that we have on Earth uh I don't believe God intended for us to spend any of that time tearing one another down or gossiping or talking negatively towards your brother or your sister I think that there's so many scriptures and we're going to go through some of these scriptures kind of kind of fast here but so many of these scriptures are are talking about unity in the faith and being in one mind and being in one Accord um You probably won't follow me with this Caleb because I'm going to go kind of quick but 1 Corinthians 12:12 says for as the body is one and hath many members and all the members of that one body being many are one body so also is Christ for by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether we be Bond or free and have been all made to drink and one spirit for the body is not one member but many amen skipping down to verse 18 it says but now hath God set the members everyone in that body as it has pleased him and if they were all one member where were the body but now they are all members yet one body and the eye cannot say un the hand I have no need of thee nor again to the feet I have no need of thee nay much more of these members of the body which seem to be more feeble are necessary and those members of the body which we think to be less hon honorable upon these we bestow a more abundant honor and our uncomely parts are have more abundant cless for our comely Parts have no need but God hath tempered the body together having given more abundant honor to that part which lacked that there should be excuse me no Schism in the body but that the members should have the same care one for another and whether one member suffer all members suffer or whether one member be honored all the members Rejoice with it now we are the body of Christ and members in particular we are the body one Unity amen we're talking about Unity right now I'm going to go through some of these kind of fast but he looks like he's following along great so Galatians 3:28 says there is neither Jew nor Greek there is neither Bond nor free th there is neither male nor female for ye are all one in Christ Jesus amen Philippians 22-3 says fulfill ye my joy that you be likeminded having the same love being of one mind and one Accord let nothing be done through Strife or vain Glory but in lowliness of Mind Let each esteem other better than themselves look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others and let this mind be in you which was also in Christ I I love that scripture it says in loneliness of Mind esteem your brother esteem your sister higher than yourself they may be going through a struggle in their life they may be going through something in their life esteem them higher than yourself pray for that person encourage that person you know where where do where do it where to be a part of one body amen and then let this mind that's how you let the mind of Christ be in you you apply these scriptures Romans 14:19 let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace and things wherewith one may edify another Colossians 3:13 says forbearing one another and forgiving one another If any man have a quarrel against any even as Christ forgave you so also do ye and I like to read this one in the Amplified that Colossians 3:13 be bearing graciously with one another and willingly forgiving each other if one has a cause for complaint against another just as the Lord has forgiven you so should you forgive so graciously forgive that person and willingly forgive sometimes you come to come to a situation and you know we're going to forgive but are we going to willingly forgive that person are we going to graciously do it and then if you have a complaint against that person just as the Lord forgave you forgive that person and then this last scripture here says Psalms Psalms 133 says behold how good and how pleasant it is for brothers to dwell in unity it is like Precious oil of consecration poured on the head coming down on the beer even the beard of Aaron this is the Amplified version even of beard coming even the beard of Aaron coming down upon the edge of his Priestly robes consecrating the whole body it is like the Dew of Mount Herman coming down on the hills of Zion for there the Lord has Comm commanded the blessing life forever more and I'm just kind of running out of time here but you know brother Jason always has that saying you know we're all all for one and and one for all you know we are to recognize the enemy in every one of his tactics and many times in our life he's not going to get us in a certain way so he's going to try every single other way to to try to get you that's just that's what the devil is he's Relentless he's out to kill you he's out to steal your life he's out to destroy you he's out to bring Schism in the body he's out to he's out to recognize people's flaws I mean that we we spent a lot of time on that but he's going to magnify those things and what are we to do we are to take every single thought captive in the name of Jesus Christ and if it doesn't admonish someone if it doesn't encourage and uplift now there's corre it the Bible says there is a place for correction this is the house of correction and it says if you have a quarrel against your brother go to that person and make it known under that person and if they're a brother or if they're a sister then that will make it right the Lord in you and the Lord in them will recognize that one of us may be wrong in this situation and then you're going to pray about it but besides that all of the negativity the negativity that can creep into our lives just recognize that that is a tactic of the enemy and that he's trying to cause schisms in the body he's trying to get into the church in every way in every shape and every form but if we can and I talked on this last time if all of the of the thought processes that we think we think 50 to 70,000 thoughts a day of all of those thoughts I know that we're constantly having to battle mind battles it's the greatest battle ever fought and we're constantly having to bring things into subjection to the Holy Ghost and bringing things into subjection what I'm looking looking at right here among all of you is a bunch of soldiers who are having to fight daily before you even come to church before before I even know the Mind battles that you're having you're having those mind battles and so you're a soldier and you're having to constantly put things into subjection in your mind so what I what my encouragement to you is wield The Sword and recognize that if that thought doesn't line up with the word if that thought doesn't admonish a brother if that thought isn't going to edify one another then cast sit down in the name of Jesus and encourage one another encourage yourself in the Lord and continue to press on Amen Let's uh let's just bow our heads Heavenly Father we just want to thank you for this time together father I just pray that you would be with the remainder of the service Lord God just the most important part here coming shortly father just the ministering of your word I pray that you'd Lord anoint the speaker anoint the hear father be with the musicians Lord May everything be done today to glorify you we love you now and ask it all in the name of Jesus Christ amen God bless you
