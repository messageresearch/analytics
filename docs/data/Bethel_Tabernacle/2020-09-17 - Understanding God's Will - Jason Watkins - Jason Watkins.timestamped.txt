[14:42] we give him another hand clap of praise
[14:46] i find the words for that song by giving
[14:48] myself away
[15:00] you know i gave a message recently to a
[15:02] friend of mine i've been praying about
[15:03] it for a while
[15:05] his name is jason i work with him and i
[15:08] haven't done it in a while
[15:10] and i was so checked because nowadays
[15:13] all they got to do is look up one name
[15:15] and they see all this negative and i
[15:18] prayed real hard and i just never gave
[15:21] him anything in two minutes
[15:22] two months went by and he actually asked
[15:26] for it
[15:27] he said you said you were going to give
[15:28] me a sermon i said okay
[15:31] i'll give you a sermon but i looked
[15:34] right at him
[15:35] in his eyes and i said listen i'm going
[15:37] to tell you something this
[15:40] message of jesus christ means more to me
[15:43] than my own life it means more to me

[15:49] than my family
[15:51] what i gave to you is precious
[15:54] and i want you to know that and i think
[15:57] that he realized
[15:59] how important it was because
[16:02] salvation and eternal life you don't
[16:04] take that lightly
[16:07] just pray his name is brother his name
[16:09] is jason i'll call him brother by faith

[36:08] amen praise the lord amen ruth chapter 1
[36:12] it's a lengthy reading so i want to just
[36:14] get right into it going to catch this
[36:16] whole chapter
[36:18] now it came to pass in the days when the
[36:20] judges ruled
[36:22] that there was a famine in the land and
[36:24] a certain man
[36:25] of bethlehem judah went to sojourn in
[36:27] the country of moab he
[36:29] and his wife and his two sons the name
[36:32] of the man was elimelech the name of his
[36:35] wife naomi
[36:37] and the name of his two sons malone and
[36:39] charlon
[36:41] euphrates of bethlehem
[36:44] judah and they came into the country of
[36:47] moab
[36:48] and continued there and
[36:52] elimelech naomi's husband died
[36:55] and she was left and her two sons
[36:58] and they took them wives of the women of
[37:00] moab
[37:01] the name of the one was orpah and the
[37:04] name of the other ruth
[37:06] and they dwelt there about 10 years
[37:09] and milan and chileon died
[37:13] also both of them and the woman was
[37:16] left of her two sons
[37:19] and her husband then she arose with her
[37:22] daughters
[37:23] in law that she might return from the
[37:26] country of moab
[37:27] for she had heard in the country of moab
[37:29] how that the lord had visited his people
[37:32] in giving them bread wherefore she went
[37:35] forth out of the place where she was
[37:37] and her two daughters in law with her
[37:40] and they went on the way to return
[37:42] unto the land of judah and naomi said
[37:45] unto her two daughters-in-law
[37:48] go return each to her mother's house
[37:51] the lord deal kindly with you as ye have
[37:54] dealt with the dead and with me
[37:56] the lord grant you that you may find
[37:59] rest
[38:00] each of you in the house of her husband
[38:03] then she kissed
[38:04] them and they lifted up their voice and
[38:06] wept
[38:07] and they said unto her surely we will
[38:09] return with thee
[38:10] unto thy people and naomi said turn
[38:14] again my daughters
[38:15] why will you go with me are there yet
[38:18] any more sons in my womb
[38:20] that they may be your husbands turn
[38:22] again my daughters go your way for i am
[38:24] too old
[38:25] to have a husband if i should say i have
[38:28] hope if
[38:29] i should have a husband also tonight and
[38:32] should also bear sons
[38:34] would you tarry for them until they were
[38:35] grown would you stay
[38:37] for them from having husbands name my
[38:39] daughters
[38:40] for it grieveth me much for your sakes
[38:43] that the hand of the lord has gone out
[38:44] against me
[38:46] and they lifted up their voice and wept
[38:48] again and orpah kissed her mother-in-law
[38:51] but ruth cleaved unto her and she said
[38:54] behold thy sister-in-law has gone back
[38:56] unto her people and under her gods
[38:59] returned thou
[39:00] after thy sister-in-law and ruth said
[39:02] entreat me not to leave thee
[39:05] or to return from following after thee
[39:07] for whither thou goest i will go
[39:10] and where thou largest i will lodge thy
[39:12] people shall be my
[39:14] people and thy god my god where thou
[39:16] diest i will die
[39:18] and there will i be buried the lord do
[39:21] so to me and more also
[39:23] if ought but death partly in me
[39:26] when she saw that she was steadfastly
[39:28] minded to go with her
[39:30] then she left speaking unto her so they
[39:33] too went until they came to bethlehem
[39:36] and it came to pass when they were come
[39:38] to bethlehem
[39:39] that all the city was moved about them
[39:42] and they said
[39:43] is this naomi and she said unto them
[39:46] call me not
[39:47] naomi call me mara for the almighty
[39:51] hath dealt very bitterly with me i went
[39:54] out full
[39:55] and the lord hath brought me home again
[39:57] empty
[39:59] when they call why then call you me
[40:02] naomi seeing the lord hath testified
[40:05] against me
[40:06] and the almighty hath afflicted me so
[40:09] naomi returned
[40:10] and ruth the moabitess her
[40:12] daughter-in-law with her
[40:14] which returned out of the country of
[40:16] moab and they came to bethlehem

[42:31] because that it came at the harvest time
[42:35] at the beginning of barley season
[42:37] and so the book of ruth is actually
[42:41] read at the feast of pentecost because
[42:43] so much of the story
[42:45] is set in the harvest fields um
[42:48] it's it's it's um
[42:51] and that's significant because brother
[42:53] branham talks about um
[42:55] how that the barley the the fact that it
[42:58] was barley season
[42:59] meant that it was the time of fresh
[43:01] bread and so
[43:02] we realized in brother branham typing it
[43:05] as he preached a number of times out of
[43:06] this book of ruth
[43:08] that because it meant fresh bread then
[43:10] it correlates directly to our day
[43:13] so if you go and hear kinsman redeemer
[43:14] or revelation chapter 5 or the breach
[43:17] or any of those you'll hear brother
[43:18] branham uh making these connections
[43:21] that's why in fact as he took
[43:22] this story in the breach because it's
[43:25] the time
[43:26] uh moving between the ages and and the
[43:29] seals
[43:30] and so it comes at barley now right on
[43:33] the heels of barley season is wheat
[43:35] season
[43:35] it's interesting that by the time ruth
[43:37] gets to wheat season she's married
[43:40] amen and she has she she owns it all
[43:42] amen so you can see i don't i don't
[43:44] think i have to spend too much time
[43:46] uh making connecting the dots for you um
[43:49] just to give you that reference that
[43:50] brother branham gave us and so we can
[43:52] see it in the scriptures
[43:55] you know understanding god's will
[43:57] sometimes it's
[43:58] bizarre amen sometimes it makes no sense
[44:02] humanly speaking but you know i i
[44:05] i when i read my bible it
[44:08] it it warns me in advance that the ways
[44:11] of god
[44:12] are not like my ways and in fact is
[44:15] it tells me i'm glad it does it gives me
[44:19] kind of a a warning that his
[44:22] ways are so far his
[44:25] thoughts are so far above my thoughts
[44:29] and my ways and how i would do something
[44:33] and you know something friends i am one
[44:35] to testify
[44:36] to you here tonight that i'm glad it's
[44:39] that way
[44:40] i'm glad he's in control
[44:43] trust me you don't want me to be in
[44:45] control of all this and
[44:47] i don't want you to be in control of
[44:48] this we want him to be in control of it
[44:50] all
[44:51] so whatever comes i think as believers
[44:54] here at the end time and we're looking
[44:56] at some very
[44:57] strange and unsettling times but jason
[45:00] and i were at lunch today talking about
[45:02] that very thing
[45:03] that you know things are happening and
[45:05] it's coming in not not like we expected
[45:07] there is so much that is happening and
[45:10] i'm here to tell you
[45:11] it's not exactly how we were looking for
[45:14] it to unfold
[45:16] you know you say well what's ahead well
[45:18] i know generally what's ahead
[45:20] but what it's going to look like yeah
[45:23] i'm going to tell you something friends
[45:24] as i was saying to you sunday you're
[45:26] going to want to be really close to him
[45:27] now
[45:28] you're going to want to be really close
[45:30] i'll say it again you're going to really
[45:32] need to be close
[45:33] that was what the lord told israel when
[45:35] they were headed to a wilderness
[45:37] and said now make sure you stay close to
[45:39] the preachers
[45:41] stay close to the ark stay uptight don't
[45:44] don't don't be stragglers because you've
[45:46] never been this way
[45:48] and uh some things are going to happen
[45:50] that are going to surprise you
[45:51] and so we look at this trying to
[45:54] understand
[45:55] god's will sometimes friends
[45:58] you know i want to just say this
[46:00] outright and i know that you
[46:02] have experienced it sometimes there is
[46:05] no human understanding of god's will
[46:08] sometimes things happen and god does it
[46:11] in a certain way
[46:12] and leaves you astonished at his way
[46:15] sometimes you feel like you're the one
[46:18] on the
[46:19] getting the sword into the stick and yet
[46:21] god did it
[46:22] [Applause]
[46:24] amen so you know this is where brother
[46:26] branham said you know
[46:28] in that that that that that when you
[46:31] have
[46:31] prayed and you're in a situation and
[46:35] and god doesn't seem to be moving and
[46:37] you've turned over every stone and
[46:39] you've done
[46:39] everything you've checked everything
[46:41] everything in your life
[46:43] is get gets a check box your your
[46:46] motive your objective is good but god
[46:49] still
[46:50] sits silent and brother branham says
[46:53] that's the time that's when you've got
[46:55] to be
[46:56] certain of god amen
[46:59] now what does that mean it means that i
[47:02] i know
[47:04] him and i know he'll do the right thing
[47:08] i know whatever he does would be the
[47:11] right thing
[47:13] he's not he might not do it at all like
[47:15] i think would be the right thing
[47:17] what he might do i might think it's the
[47:19] wrong thing but
[47:20] because i'm so certain of him
[47:25] then i can say well yes i
[47:28] i know that the god of all like abraham
[47:30] said that be far from thee
[47:32] to kill the innocent the righteous with
[47:34] the wicked
[47:35] and he said shall not the god of all the
[47:37] earth do right
[47:39] think of that faith that abraham had
[47:40] abraham wasn't you know
[47:42] trying to front on on melchizedek
[47:44] abraham was just simply making a
[47:46] statement of faith
[47:47] i know you i know you'll do the right
[47:50] thing
[47:51] and so you know in no matter what we're
[47:53] facing
[47:54] in this life if you're going to try to
[47:56] understand god's will
[47:58] understand this principle first all his
[48:00] word is true
[48:01] and all of his ways are just amen
[48:05] and just determine that now in advance
[48:08] before you know what happens tomorrow
[48:11] determine right now before i get to
[48:13] tomorrow
[48:14] before i face whatever it is i don't
[48:15] know that i'm gonna face
[48:17] i'm deciding right now all of his word
[48:20] is true
[48:20] and all of his ways are just and i won't
[48:24] need
[48:24] any evidence to make me think that
[48:26] tomorrow
[48:28] and fact is i will still think it if
[48:30] every piece of evidence flies in the
[48:32] face of them amen
[48:34] amen i don't think there is any
[48:38] opening chapter in any book of the bible
[48:41] to me
[48:41] anyway that within the space of
[48:46] one opening chapter that you have
[48:49] something start with such promise and
[48:52] such hope only to end an
[48:56] unspeakable yes amen heartbreak
[49:00] amen
[49:03] you know this man of judah with his
[49:07] family
[49:08] you know he's uh he he's he's trying to
[49:12] feed a family trying to get trying to
[49:14] get along trying to do the best he can
[49:16] he's
[49:16] part of the chosen heritage of god
[49:21] it's true that when an israelite leaves
[49:24] the promised land he's backslid and i
[49:26] get that and sometimes
[49:28] men in a little bit of you know back
[49:31] backsliding isn't always like some
[49:33] over the cliff like you you're back in a
[49:35] bar on a barstool
[49:37] right sometimes backsliding just means
[49:39] you don't pray quite like you used to
[49:42] you don't have quite the relationship
[49:44] that you used to have with the lord
[49:46] and so you start making edgy decisions
[49:49] that you wouldn't have made
[49:51] right you don't get quiet on me this
[49:53] fast we're just getting started
[49:57] you know i grew up in a church where
[49:59] they would always say if you can't say
[50:00] amen say oh me
[50:02] oh my oh goodness and so they
[50:13] there's a famine yeah this this is this
[50:16] this is thought to be probably the 12th
[50:18] century bc
[50:20] sometime around when the when gideon was
[50:22] on the scene in the midianites you
[50:24] remember
[50:24] invading the land and even gideon the
[50:26] deliverer is down in a hole hiding and
[50:28] eli there's not much help going on in
[50:30] the house of god because eli
[50:32] you know what's going on with him and
[50:34] his sons
[50:35] and so you know what's a man to do you
[50:38] can't
[50:39] you know you're you're the deliverers
[50:41] hiding
[50:42] the the the priesthood are corrupt
[50:45] there's famine in the land
[50:46] what's a man to do i got mouths to feed
[50:49] and so you know what he does
[50:50] he he leaves before it gets bad he sees
[50:54] it coming
[50:55] remember naomi said her testimony was i
[50:58] left full
[50:58] i came home empty so they he doesn't
[51:01] wait
[51:01] he's he's savvy he doesn't wait
[51:05] you know forever to lose everything he
[51:08] just goes ahead and says look i think we
[51:10] better
[51:10] hightail it to moab and kind of lay low
[51:13] for a while
[51:14] and you know nature will take its course
[51:16] and this famine will
[51:18] uh will break and sure enough it did
[51:20] after 10 years or so
[51:24] and so here they are you know trying to
[51:26] help themselves during a
[51:28] time of severity in the land of israel
[51:31] and you know they're they're they're
[51:34] part of
[51:35] god's chosen people just like you
[51:38] just like me and i mean there's some
[51:41] times where you just say man i'm just
[51:42] trying to get by
[51:45] i mean i'm doing my best brother jason i
[51:47] you know i'm i'm
[51:48] i'm i'm god i'm trying to make it to
[51:50] church i'm i'm trying to feed a family
[51:52] i'm trying to raise
[51:53] children i'm i'm doing all these things
[51:55] at one time and
[51:56] husbands and wives and and are good
[51:59] working together and
[52:00] i mean let's face it sometimes friends
[52:02] we can find ourselves
[52:04] in a calamity and you really don't
[52:06] understand it because you're
[52:08] you were doing the best you could amen
[52:11] i mean i'm just trying to survive here
[52:14] you know
[52:18] am i not a chosen come on member of
[52:20] god's family
[52:21] sure so were they yeah
[52:25] you know i'm not running out sin and
[52:27] neither were they
[52:28] amen you know and they said to her verse
[52:32] 10
[52:33] surely we will return with thee unto thy
[52:37] people
[52:37] and naomi said verse 11 turn again my
[52:40] daughters why will you go with me
[52:42] are there yet any more sons in my womb
[52:44] that they may be your husbands turn
[52:46] again my daughters go your way
[52:47] if i'm too old to have a husband if i
[52:49] should say i have hope
[52:51] if i should have a husband also tonight
[52:53] and should also bear sons
[52:55] would you tarry for them till there
[52:59] until they were grown would you stay for
[53:01] them from
[53:02] having husbands i mean listen friends
[53:06] naomi and arpa and ruth
[53:10] are in quite the impossible
[53:13] situation amen amen three widows
[53:17] back to back to back
[53:21] such promise a husband two more husbands
[53:25] everything's going good left with plenty
[53:28] and suddenly hudson number one's dead
[53:31] husband number two is dead
[53:32] husband number three is dead and here's
[53:34] three ladies
[53:35] yeah amen right out in out in the middle
[53:38] of nowhere
[53:40] with no no social services
[53:44] no pension no government gonna step in
[53:48] and three women and one of them elderly
[53:54] turn again name my daughters for he
[53:57] grieveth me
[53:58] much for your sakes that the hand of the
[54:00] lord has gone out against me
[54:02] and they lifted up their voice and wept
[54:04] again and orbit kissed her mother-in-law
[54:07] but ruth cleaved unto her there's
[54:09] something
[54:10] about ruth or something different she
[54:14] was a moabite
[54:15] just like orpah was she was a
[54:18] daughter-in-law
[54:19] just like orpah was she was married to a
[54:22] hebrew just like
[54:24] oprah was she had a hebrew
[54:27] father-in-law just like arpa had she
[54:30] loved
[54:31] naomi orbit loved naomi
[54:34] but now somehow there there's some kind
[54:37] of a different
[54:38] revelation that begins to take place
[54:41] and you can't put your finger on it and
[54:44] there's not anything that would
[54:46] that would add up to go why would ruth
[54:48] but but not orpah she's go
[54:50] ruth stays why why is ruth even staying
[54:52] that almost seems crazy
[54:53] it almost looks like corpus the smart
[54:55] one yeah right
[54:57] but you know when you when god begins to
[55:00] reveal something to your heart
[55:01] you don't always understand it it don't
[55:04] always make sense but
[55:07] you as a son and daughter god how many
[55:09] children of god can witness with me
[55:11] tonight
[55:12] when god starts dealing with your heart
[55:13] you don't you just have to go that way
[55:16] and you can't always explain it and it
[55:18] doesn't even make sense
[55:19] to the man in the mirror
[55:23] and you look in the mirror go what are
[55:24] you doing
[55:28] [Music]
[55:30] oh have i ever experienced that
[55:33] take actions as a pastor preach a
[55:35] certain thing make a certain decision
[55:37] and you know even even and sometimes
[55:40] sister daddy say
[55:40] why'd you decide to do it like that you
[55:42] know not contending with me just curious
[55:44] why did you decide
[55:45] because it wasn't what i thought you
[55:47] might would do why'd you decide to do it
[55:49] like that and i said well i wish i knew
[55:52] amen i wish i knew what's up all i know
[55:55] is i know better than to disobey that
[55:57] voice
[55:58] amen amen see i i found out the hard way
[56:01] you don't do that
[56:03] i said no no you hear that voice that
[56:05] still small voice
[56:06] and you know it's god and you've got
[56:08] enough training now you've been doing
[56:09] this long enough you know what
[56:11] you know what that voice sounds and
[56:12] feels like
[56:14] and so she said behold thy sister-in-law
[56:17] has gone back into her people
[56:18] and under her god's return though after
[56:20] thy sister-in-law
[56:22] and ruth said entreat me not to leave
[56:24] thee or return from following after thee
[56:27] for wither thou goest i will go that's
[56:29] crazy
[56:30] where thou largest i will lodge well thy
[56:32] people shall be my people and
[56:34] thy god my god where thou diest i will
[56:38] die is this woman lost
[56:39] leave of her senses where you die i'll
[56:43] die and there i'll be buried
[56:45] she doesn't even know what's ahead she's
[56:48] never even been to the land she's
[56:49] planning to go to
[56:51] she knows nothing about it
[56:54] the lord do so to me and more also if
[56:56] all but death so apart me and thee
[56:59] and when she saw that she was
[57:01] steadfast-minded to go with her
[57:03] she then she left off speaking i'm gonna
[57:05] tell you something she
[57:06] she heard ruth uh bind her
[57:09] soul i'm here to tell you something
[57:11] friends long ago i bound my
[57:13] soul to this word and i and he never
[57:16] told me it would be
[57:17] easy he only told me it would be worth
[57:19] it
[57:20] but and i i don't always understand my
[57:22] life and i don't understand the ups and
[57:23] downs i don't understand my own self
[57:26] but i i bound my soul to this thing
[57:29] and the whole world can think i'm crazy
[57:31] and if i'm the only one left standing
[57:33] that believes this then i'll just have
[57:35] to be the only one left
[57:36] [Applause]
[57:38] hallelujah so they too went until they
[57:41] came to bethlehem
[57:43] verse 19 and it came to pass when they
[57:45] were come to bethlehem
[57:47] that all the city was moved about them
[57:50] and they said
[57:51] is this naomi see
[57:55] so this remember this is correlating to
[57:58] our day this is the barley harvest when
[58:00] the fresh manna when a fresh revival
[58:02] starts
[58:03] and and then it's going to go to a wheat
[58:05] harvest and there's going to be a
[58:08] pure word and we're going to have a
[58:10] restoration of
[58:11] of the family of god in the earth and
[58:13] this is this is the time when
[58:15] when israel is going to go back under
[58:16] the trumpets amen because remember the
[58:19] trumpets the seals the vials the plagues
[58:21] they all run
[58:23] you know synchronously like that and so
[58:27] while the seals are breaking to the
[58:29] gentiles the trumpets are breaking to
[58:30] the jews and sending them home
[58:32] amen and so so you're seeing this type
[58:36] these beautiful types here so so this is
[58:38] the time when israel
[58:40] long gone has now returned she's been
[58:42] gone she left with plenty
[58:44] and now they've been gone and israel
[58:46] been gone and but but in the
[58:47] but in the harvest time at the time of
[58:50] the feast of pentecost
[58:51] now they're now the trumpets are moving
[58:54] and israel's starting to come back to
[58:55] their homeland
[58:56] and this is now only representing the
[58:57] old orthodox church
[59:00] and she said unto them call me not naomi
[59:02] call me mara for
[59:04] almighty have dealt very bitterly with
[59:05] me who could blame them for feeling this
[59:07] way
[59:08] after two thousand years of torment and
[59:10] persecution and death and
[59:12] pogroms and concentration camps and
[59:15] and ever government trying to slaughter
[59:17] human
[59:21] she says i went out full and the lord
[59:24] hath brought me home again empty
[59:26] why then call you me now only seeing the
[59:28] lord have testified against me and the
[59:30] almighty
[59:31] hath afflicted me and it would it would
[59:33] take a profit
[59:34] to interpret this verse because it types
[59:37] israel returning yeah
[59:39] and call it the tender hand of jehovah
[59:41] right
[59:42] wow that to this day blows my mind
[59:49] so naomi returned and ruth the mole bite
[59:53] is her daughter-in-law with her
[59:55] which returned out of the country of
[59:56] moab and they came to bethlehem in the
[59:58] beginning of barley harvest
[1:00:00] so this time at the at the harvest of
[1:00:04] pentecost because
[1:00:05] uh ruth now as a gentile so
[1:00:08] this is the time of the final harvest
[1:00:10] this is the the process
[1:00:12] leading up to where you know god has
[1:00:14] already sent a prophet
[1:00:16] he's he's kind of one born out of season
[1:00:18] from the azusa revival
[1:00:20] and it's kind of that in-between place
[1:00:22] where he's trying to
[1:00:23] pull the church together and yet they're
[1:00:26] closing doors on him and
[1:00:27] then the seals are going to open and
[1:00:28] then a brad's going to be born
[1:00:30] amen so i'm not trying to place all that
[1:00:34] here that's not what my sermon is about
[1:00:36] tonight
[1:00:36] i just want you to be really really
[1:00:38] glued in that this is you
[1:00:40] this is now all right
[1:00:44] and so you know this is the time of the
[1:00:47] of the harvest for ruth who's a gentile
[1:00:50] who's going to represent the gentile
[1:00:52] bride who's going to marry boaz who
[1:00:54] represents christ
[1:00:56] amen and it's going to come down to
[1:00:59] where
[1:00:59] there's another nearer kinsmen and
[1:01:02] brother branham says that represents the
[1:01:04] devil
[1:01:05] who could not redeem her because the
[1:01:08] problem was he said i can't do it
[1:01:10] because i
[1:01:10] i i'll mar my own inheritance and
[1:01:12] brother branham shows how that
[1:01:14] what that simply means is is that he
[1:01:17] could not redeem
[1:01:18] because the devil he couldn't redeem you
[1:01:21] from sin because he himself is a sinner
[1:01:23] yes
[1:01:24] amen it would take somebody who's not
[1:01:26] that
[1:01:27] to redeem and that's boaz that's christ
[1:01:30] hallelujah amen
[1:01:34] he tried but he couldn't do it remember
[1:01:37] the
[1:01:38] book of life when adam lost it it went
[1:01:40] to the devil
[1:01:41] but brother brown said but his filthy
[1:01:43] hands couldn't hold it and god took it
[1:01:44] back
[1:01:47] so we find then that you know just as
[1:01:51] this last day bride whose story ends
[1:01:55] quite well
[1:01:56] amen amen oh yeah hey our future is
[1:02:00] bright

[1:02:04] listen your future is bright amen
[1:02:07] and just as this last day bride ruth's
[1:02:10] story
[1:02:11] ends quite well the story of ruth ends
[1:02:13] with a
[1:02:14] with the most beautiful ending but it
[1:02:17] it had to go through a lot to get there

[1:02:25] understand the will of god
[1:02:27] in the getting you there part
[1:02:30] amen i mean it's going to end
[1:02:34] for ruth she could have never hoped
[1:02:38] she's going to be married to the lord of
[1:02:40] the harvest
[1:02:42] inheriting all the wealth and bounty of
[1:02:44] the land and even the land itself
[1:02:48] she rose to a station above all others
[1:02:51] who had who had labored far more
[1:02:55] for her far longer than her
[1:02:59] and she just went right past and went

[1:03:01] heart
[1:03:02] all right hallelujah
[1:03:05] you know i've seen splendor i've stood

[1:04:06] same way you know

[1:04:09] line in a moment
[1:04:10] simply by winning the heart of the
[1:04:12] prince
[1:04:14] it's all it took and grace kelly becomes
[1:04:17] the princess
[1:04:18] and diana goes from a certain family
[1:04:21] level and just rockets to the top
[1:04:23] princess all because they win the heart
[1:04:26] of the prince

[1:04:54] and all the people that were in the gate
[1:04:56] and the elders said we are witnesses the
[1:04:58] lord make the woman that has come into
[1:05:00] thine house like rachel and like leah i
[1:05:02] mean this was some of the
[1:05:03] the best things they could these were
[1:05:05] some of the best blessings they could
[1:05:06] ask
[1:05:07] for her amen may she be like rachel and
[1:05:10] leah
[1:05:11] which too did build the house of israel
[1:05:14] and do thou worthily in ephrata and be
[1:05:17] famous in bethlehem
[1:05:18] and let thy house be like the house of
[1:05:20] pharas who tamar born to judah
[1:05:23] of the seed which the lord shall give
[1:05:25] thee of this young woman
[1:05:27] they loved boaz they admired boaz with
[1:05:30] with an undying loyalty you read the
[1:05:32] story it's only four chapters long you
[1:05:34] read about his servants they're so
[1:05:36] loyal they're he tells them don't you
[1:05:38] touch her and they won't they won't go
[1:05:40] near her
[1:05:41] he tells them you drop handfuls of
[1:05:42] purpose and they drop them you know all
[1:05:44] along the way so she can pick him up
[1:05:46] she's headed
[1:05:47] she's headed to the top but she's got
[1:05:49] some struggles to go through
[1:05:51] she's got some work some labor she's got
[1:05:53] today
[1:05:54] amen and so they were thrilled for him
[1:05:58] you know just like the bible
[1:06:00] tells us how that angels rejoice any
[1:06:03] time
[1:06:03] a sinner is saved any time a prodigal
[1:06:06] son
[1:06:06] comes home angels rejoice it's so
[1:06:09] difficult
[1:06:10] friends to imagine the kingdom that
[1:06:14] we're going to
[1:06:15] amen it's so hard to get your mind
[1:06:19] wrapped around the a place of
[1:06:22] perfect love i mean just like here
[1:06:26] everybody's happy yeah
[1:06:29] not everybody's getting to marry the
[1:06:31] prince
[1:06:33] not everybody's going to live in the
[1:06:34] castle but everybody's happy
[1:06:37] there's no envy there's no jealousy
[1:06:38] there there oh boaz way to go oh she's
[1:06:41] beautiful
[1:06:42] all the women wanted to be ruth and all
[1:06:43] the men wanted to be boys and they're
[1:06:45] the heroes of the story
[1:06:47] that's how it ends that's how it's going
[1:06:49] to end for you
[1:06:50] it's a mr jesus and this is jesus
[1:06:54] hallelujah the world will stand in all
[1:06:56] of it friends there's nothing to compare
[1:06:58] there's nothing to compare in this life
[1:07:00] to the status that ruth the moabitess
[1:07:03] would attain there's nothing to compare
[1:07:04] to what you're headed for
[1:07:06] amen you remember that in the heat of
[1:07:09] trial
[1:07:10] and times when the enemy is attacking
[1:07:12] you you just
[1:07:13] you just put it in your mind this can't
[1:07:15] last forever
[1:07:16] i got a new world a new body a whole new
[1:07:19] life
[1:07:19] and it doesn't matter what happens here
[1:07:23] hallelujah until then as the song says
[1:07:27] until then my heart will go on singing
[1:07:30] until then with joy i'll carry on
[1:07:33] in the midst of trials no matter what it
[1:07:35] is
[1:07:37] it's difficult to imagine you know but
[1:07:40] but remember to to rule at that level
[1:07:45] for ruth to ex to achieve that
[1:07:48] for this bride to achieve the station
[1:07:51] that she's going to achieve
[1:07:53] there has to be character building every
[1:07:56] man
[1:07:56] there has to be friends to rule there
[1:07:59] has to be
[1:08:00] character and right you know i i thought
[1:08:03] about
[1:08:03] you know in in history
[1:08:06] i thought about down through the history
[1:08:08] how many
[1:08:09] armies have marched into battle how many
[1:08:12] brave knights and brave gallant men
[1:08:16] and lost their lives and women became
[1:08:19] widowed and
[1:08:20] children became orphaned oh you know
[1:08:22] fought these hard battles
[1:08:24] and bled out on battlefields just to
[1:08:27] just to place a mortal man
[1:08:29] on a throne yeah amen
[1:08:33] and then only to see him unfit
[1:08:37] yeah with no character and and see him
[1:08:40] literally become a traitor to everything
[1:08:43] that they
[1:08:43] bled and died for and sacrificed their
[1:08:45] lives and sacrificed their fortunes
[1:08:47] history is replete with that
[1:08:50] covered up with that joan of arc gave
[1:08:52] her life trying to
[1:08:53] trying to put the dolphin of france on
[1:08:55] the throne and she accomplished it he
[1:08:57] turned on her and sold her out to the
[1:08:59] catholic church and they burned her at
[1:09:01] the stake
[1:09:02] amen how many friends have have have
[1:09:04] gave their lives and wasted them
[1:09:06] just to put a a frail man on a throne
[1:09:09] and put a crown on top of his head
[1:09:12] oh my i'm here to tell you something
[1:09:13] friends we're headed for somewhere
[1:09:16] and there's no way to build character
[1:09:18] apart from suffering
[1:09:19] otherwise listen otherwise the kingdom
[1:09:22] that we're going to won't last
[1:09:25] you understand jesus had to suffer
[1:09:27] you've got to suffer
[1:09:29] because we're not looking to put
[1:09:30] somebody on the throne who can't handle
[1:09:32] it he's not looking for a bride who
[1:09:35] can't handle rulership
[1:09:38] oh my what a cruel that would be the
[1:09:42] cruelest thought in all creation
[1:09:44] amen something on such a scale
[1:09:48] as the as the book of revelation
[1:09:50] describes that we're going to
[1:09:52] something friends on that scale of of i
[1:09:55] john says i i saw a city
[1:09:58] oh and foundations and gates of pearl
[1:10:02] and the glory of god streaming brother
[1:10:04] branham says
[1:10:05] a tree of life down the river of life
[1:10:07] and angel choir
[1:10:08] singing that's what we're headed for
[1:10:11] hallelujah
[1:10:13] hallelujah what a what a tragedy that
[1:10:15] would be if we
[1:10:16] if we put king jesus on a throne only to
[1:10:19] have him characterless
[1:10:22] and to see everything that nature has
[1:10:25] grown for
[1:10:26] and mankind has grown for and we've had
[1:10:28] to we've had to
[1:10:29] run always trying to run from the
[1:10:31] certainty of death and always trying to
[1:10:33] secure ourselves and we go through all
[1:10:34] of this
[1:10:36] and get there and we find out our king
[1:10:39] is no good
[1:10:44] that's the kind of thing i want that
[1:10:46] ain't what i'm striving for
[1:10:48] that ain't what i'm striving for that
[1:10:50] ain't what i'm living for
[1:10:51] i want a king who's gonna stay the king
[1:10:54] who's full of character and full of
[1:10:56] wisdom and tells the truth
[1:10:58] all the time every time always his all
[1:11:00] of his words are true
[1:11:01] and all of his ways are just and if i
[1:11:03] want him if i want to have that kind of
[1:11:05] a husband
[1:11:06] he wants that kind of a pride who can
[1:11:08] take the test
[1:11:09] and stand there and say i'll take the
[1:11:11] way with the lord despise
[1:11:13] you i'm going to prove it here on this
[1:11:15] earth
[1:11:16] i'm not going to get there and and be a
[1:11:19] an unworthy queen
[1:11:22] with the king amen
[1:11:27] we've had to live under the curse of sin
[1:11:31] mankind always
[1:11:35] as i said always running from the
[1:11:37] certainty of death
[1:11:38] well guess what friends this time it's
[1:11:40] for keeps
[1:11:42] when you get that new body you ain't
[1:11:44] ever going to have to give it up again
[1:11:45] amen hallelujah when you get that new
[1:11:48] world guess what
[1:11:49] you ain't never going to have to come
[1:11:50] back here and do this again
[1:11:52] you'll be out of the devil's reach
[1:11:54] forever
[1:11:56] and finally even the devil will be
[1:11:58] destroyed and death and hell will be
[1:11:59] destroyed
[1:12:00] hallelujah amen amen
[1:12:06] so there would have to be times there
[1:12:09] would have to be times
[1:12:13] of what may seem a cruel trial
[1:12:16] an affliction
[1:12:19] such gain that ruth acquired
[1:12:24] such gain that we acquire
[1:12:28] it would have to include at times
[1:12:31] loss sometimes incomprehensible loss
[1:12:36] brother branham says from the kinsman
[1:12:38] redeemer
[1:12:39] coming back sad speaking of naomi
[1:12:44] coming back sad
[1:12:48] her husband dead her children
[1:12:51] dead with two daughter-in-laws
[1:12:55] then she turned musta and looked upon
[1:12:58] them and said why would you go with me
[1:13:00] now you can't do nothing but have
[1:13:02] trouble
[1:13:06] she said i'm i'm sorry
[1:13:10] that the hand of god is stretched out
[1:13:12] against me
[1:13:13] and naomi wondered why has the hand of
[1:13:17] the lord been
[1:13:18] so cruel to me wow my daughter-in-law's
[1:13:22] god has cast me out and i'm an outcast
[1:13:25] i don't know what i've ever done but i'm
[1:13:28] an outcast
[1:13:30] see brother branham says
[1:13:34] god was working his program wow that's
[1:13:37] right
[1:13:37] right god was working his program
[1:13:41] because all things work together for
[1:13:44] good to them that love
[1:13:46] god ready ready five words
[1:13:50] no matter what it is
[1:13:53] amen amen now how many will agree to
[1:13:56] that five
[1:13:58] no matter what it is
[1:14:01] god was working out his program because
[1:14:04] all things work together for good to
[1:14:07] them that love
[1:14:08] god no matter what it is
[1:14:13] this has to be our story also
[1:14:16] friends for we gain it all yes
[1:14:19] amen amen it's the promise of the word
[1:14:23] amen we gain it all just just say that
[1:14:25] yourself i gave it all i win
[1:14:29] amen and it wouldn't take long
[1:14:32] to become wife to the lord of the
[1:14:34] harvest
[1:14:36] once once she comes back she gets back
[1:14:39] at the beginning of barley season by the
[1:14:41] time wheat season follows it
[1:14:43] at the time of the threshing of the
[1:14:44] barley she's already being is already a
[1:14:47] proposal
[1:14:48] yeah and by the time by the time wheat
[1:14:50] harvest is coming she's already married
[1:14:53] and she's thought she's the lady of the
[1:14:55] manor
[1:14:56] glory and so i i know we're here and i
[1:14:59] know it's rough but hey
[1:15:00] it ain't going to be long i'm here to
[1:15:02] tell you it ain't going to be long
[1:15:04] naomi's already home hallelujah
[1:15:08] barley and harvest and wheat are already
[1:15:10] here there's already been an
[1:15:12] invisible union it ain't gonna be long
[1:15:16] it wouldn't take long to become the wife
[1:15:20] of the lord of the harvest but it would
[1:15:22] take labor
[1:15:23] yeah it would take patience
[1:15:27] she would have to work in the field she
[1:15:29] had the rights to the gleaner of the
[1:15:30] gleaner
[1:15:32] under under levitical law
[1:15:36] and the different different laws
[1:15:38] concerning harvest they couldn't harvest
[1:15:40] the corners of their crop
[1:15:42] because that had they had to keep that
[1:15:43] for the poor and
[1:15:45] and then the gleaners came through they
[1:15:46] didn't even need the owner's permission
[1:15:48] they had the rights of the gleaner
[1:15:50] given to them by god and so you know
[1:15:53] you're just gleaning the harvest is
[1:15:54] already done and you're just trying to
[1:15:55] get the scraps
[1:15:57] and this is her life this woman who's
[1:16:00] going to be the queen of the whole
[1:16:01] wow the whole the whole estate she's
[1:16:04] going to be the first lady of the whole
[1:16:06] estate right and boaz is a very wealthy
[1:16:08] man
[1:16:09] yeah this is this is huge and so
[1:16:12] we find out that he's there's only the
[1:16:15] in fact is the man
[1:16:16] who was closer to her which was the
[1:16:18] devil couldn't afford it
[1:16:20] he didn't have enough to pay the bill
[1:16:23] but boaz had plenty
[1:16:24] got plenty don't worry he's got plenty
[1:16:27] say it's going to take a lot to get me
[1:16:29] he's got plenty
[1:16:31] but she's going to have to suffer this
[1:16:33] loss she's going to have to journey
[1:16:35] she's going to have to follow her
[1:16:36] revelation all the way to the end
[1:16:39] no shortchange no stopping now you can't
[1:16:40] get to the point where it says
[1:16:42] oh man i made a mistake i probably
[1:16:44] should have went with orpah
[1:16:46] no you shouldn't have oh maybe i should
[1:16:49] go join her
[1:16:50] no you shouldn't stay the course stay
[1:16:53] the course i know the world's crazy
[1:16:55] i know it's getting hard but stay the
[1:16:57] course we're almost home
[1:16:59] amen might be some labor ahead of us but
[1:17:02] don't worry he's commanded his servants
[1:17:04] to feed you
[1:17:05] they'll drop handfuls of purpose just to
[1:17:07] keep you going
[1:17:08] it ain't the whole package but it'll get
[1:17:10] you there
[1:17:12] hallelujah it would take labor it would
[1:17:15] take patience as i said
[1:17:17] preaching i think last sunday maybe in
[1:17:19] the sunday school class i don't remember
[1:17:20] uh that john says i'm your companion in
[1:17:23] in tribulation
[1:17:24] and in the patience of jesus christ
[1:17:27] and i'm i remember making the point that
[1:17:30] it john says i was in the spirit you're
[1:17:32] going to need to be
[1:17:33] oh yeah otherwise you you're not going
[1:17:36] to have the patience for what we're
[1:17:37] facing
[1:17:38] amen you're not going to you're not
[1:17:40] going to be able to handle that
[1:17:42] tribulation
[1:17:43] you're gonna you might start out as a
[1:17:44] companion with john but you're not gonna
[1:17:46] hold out
[1:17:47] yeah you're gonna need to be in the
[1:17:48] spirit you're gonna need
[1:17:50] to handle the level of rejection that
[1:17:53] it's gonna
[1:17:54] require to be the bride of christ to
[1:17:56] handle
[1:17:57] that that kind of rejection worldwide
[1:18:01] if you if you really if this is really
[1:18:03] your life
[1:18:04] you're going to be rejected yes
[1:18:07] brother branham makes a statement i
[1:18:08] don't have it in front of me i can't
[1:18:10] quote it but i'm gonna
[1:18:11] i can paraphrase it very close brother
[1:18:14] bannon says you know
[1:18:15] uh he says that that if you're
[1:18:19] if you're going to be successful in this
[1:18:22] world
[1:18:23] you better not be a christian all right
[1:18:26] think about it he says if that's going
[1:18:29] to be your goal
[1:18:30] he's just trying to let you off now
[1:18:32] don't waste a bunch of time
[1:18:34] with the gospel just go be successful
[1:18:37] because you're not going to be able to
[1:18:38] do both
[1:18:42] so what's important to you that becomes
[1:18:44] the question
[1:18:45] what's best for you spiritually
[1:18:48] because i'm here to tell you at the end
[1:18:49] of the day that's all that
[1:18:52] matters
[1:18:54] it's going to take patience you're going
[1:18:56] to need to walk in the spirit
[1:18:58] you're going to have to have your nature
[1:18:59] change it's going to have to take faith
[1:19:01] in the promise of boaz when she gets
[1:19:03] that promise she
[1:19:05] she she gets some instructions from
[1:19:06] naomi how to do it
[1:19:08] you know and and she goes to the
[1:19:10] threshing floor in the night when he's
[1:19:12] married and he's laying there and she
[1:19:13] uncovers his feet and pulls it over
[1:19:15] herself
[1:19:16] it's a it's a it's an old hebrew custom
[1:19:18] what she's asking for is marriage but
[1:19:20] she can't just say will you marry me
[1:19:22] she pulls the cover over to get him to
[1:19:24] to get him to agree
[1:19:25] i'll i'll marry you will you marry me
[1:19:27] yes i'll marry you
[1:19:28] and so she's asking for a proposal amen
[1:19:32] and so he he says i'll do it and he
[1:19:35] commends her her
[1:19:36] character and he says you've been above
[1:19:38] reproach we've noticed you and
[1:19:40] you know you you didn't run with the
[1:19:42] young men and you you've showed more
[1:19:44] grace
[1:19:45] than all the others and i'll do it for
[1:19:48] you
[1:19:49] i'll do it for you tomorrow i'll go and
[1:19:51] there
[1:19:52] and and the problem is there's one
[1:19:53] closer to you than me and he actually
[1:19:55] has the
[1:19:56] rights of first refusal because you were
[1:19:58] born in sin so the devil had the first
[1:20:01] the first dibs and so boaz comes to the
[1:20:04] jesus comes to the devil and says will
[1:20:07] you buy naomi
[1:20:08] and he goes yeah i'll do it he says well
[1:20:12] if you take naomi you also have to take
[1:20:15] ruth the moabitess
[1:20:16] and then you have to raise up children
[1:20:18] to the dead husband
[1:20:20] and then he says well if i raise up
[1:20:22] children to her they'll get my
[1:20:23] inheritance and my kids won't get
[1:20:25] anything no i can't afford it i don't
[1:20:26] want to do it and he couldn't redeem her
[1:20:28] anyway because he himself
[1:20:30] needed redeemed i needed one who didn't
[1:20:33] need redeemed
[1:20:34] i need one who had never been sinful i
[1:20:36] needed one who was
[1:20:38] virgin born who was a product of the
[1:20:40] spoken word of god
[1:20:43] amen and so she but
[1:20:46] she would have to have faith in that
[1:20:48] because he just didn't jump up
[1:20:49] and run off into the nights and i'll be
[1:20:51] right back i'll be right back with the
[1:20:53] contract
[1:20:55] said you're going to have to just lay
[1:20:56] here till morning
[1:20:58] you're talking about a sleepless night i
[1:21:00] don't know whether she was sleepless for
[1:21:01] excitement or fear will he really do it
[1:21:05] this is crazy what am i doing i mean who
[1:21:09] is who am i to this guy
[1:21:10] naomi told me i came he did it and here
[1:21:12] we go i guess i'm getting married
[1:21:14] tomorrow
[1:21:16] it seemed too good to be true i was just
[1:21:18] in mo i was just
[1:21:19] in the land of moab i had a husband my
[1:21:22] goodness just months ago i had a husband
[1:21:24] i had a brother-in-law i had a
[1:21:25] father-in-law
[1:21:26] they all died and orp was gone and i
[1:21:28] followed my
[1:21:29] mother-in-law here and i've worked in
[1:21:31] the fields
[1:21:32] and i'm getting married i'm gonna go
[1:21:34] from nothing to everything
[1:21:37] i'm gonna tell you something friends the
[1:21:38] night might have been long but she had
[1:21:40] to lay there and believe it
[1:21:42] and believe it and believe it and
[1:21:44] believe it
[1:21:45] and when the sun come up and he said now
[1:21:47] quickly go out so that no one sees you
[1:21:49] leave
[1:21:50] and then she has to go back to naomi and
[1:21:52] she says i did what you told me
[1:21:54] and then naomi says all right daughter
[1:21:56] now rest
[1:21:57] you can rest because why how can i rest
[1:22:00] i'm a nervous wreck no no no
[1:22:01] no no rest if boaz promised you you
[1:22:04] don't have to worry
[1:22:05] yes you rest because he won't rest
[1:22:08] until this thing is finished
[1:22:11] [Applause]
[1:22:13] thank you lord amen
[1:22:16] it would take brother branham said there
[1:22:19] had to be
[1:22:20] ruth deciding and ruth serving and
[1:22:24] then ruth resting and then ruth rewarded
[1:22:27] that's right and so those three had to
[1:22:29] be in place to get to four
[1:22:32] she wasn't going to go just jump the
[1:22:35] line
[1:22:37] she was going to have to decide
[1:22:41] she made a decision the opposite
[1:22:42] decision of orpah
[1:22:45] she made what seemed like a crazy
[1:22:47] decision but it was a revelation
[1:22:51] then she had to serve she had to serve a
[1:22:54] mother-in-law she had to serve in the
[1:22:55] field she had to work
[1:22:57] so so you know there's she's she's
[1:23:00] she's deciding she's serving and when
[1:23:04] she made those two things and was
[1:23:05] willing to serve
[1:23:06] then she could and believe the promise
[1:23:08] then she could rest
[1:23:10] yeah and because she rested and didn't
[1:23:12] pull the panic button and sound alarms
[1:23:14] and she just did everything that naomi
[1:23:16] said and everything boaz said
[1:23:18] because you know why that's all she
[1:23:20] could do
[1:23:21] she couldn't make herself the mistress
[1:23:25] she couldn't make herself the first lady
[1:23:27] of the manor
[1:23:28] all she could do is trust the promise
[1:23:32] amen and through what must have been a
[1:23:35] long night
[1:23:36] she had to lay there and believe it
[1:23:41] she had to have faith and believe that
[1:23:44] god was in it all right
[1:23:49] she had suffered incomprehensible loss
[1:23:53] you know all of which i i thought i just
[1:23:55] thought about that all day today
[1:23:57] all of that suffering i mean ruth you're
[1:23:59] talking about an innocent bystander
[1:24:02] she's just a moabite girl who you know
[1:24:04] catches the eye of a hebrew man in her
[1:24:06] own country and
[1:24:08] you know boy meets girl and sparks fly
[1:24:10] next thing you know she's married
[1:24:12] next thing you know he's dead next thing
[1:24:15] you know she's walking to another
[1:24:16] country
[1:24:18] next thing you know she's in a field
[1:24:19] somewhere
[1:24:21] and and the bible said it was her hap
[1:24:23] h.a.p it was her hat to enter into the
[1:24:26] field of boys you know what that meant
[1:24:27] it meant it was fate it meant it was
[1:24:29] unplanned uh unplanned human
[1:24:31] human offend she didn't go in there
[1:24:34] thinking i'll go get the right field
[1:24:36] i'll go i'll work and i'll become lady
[1:24:38] uh laura you know i'll become first lady
[1:24:41] it was just her hap
[1:24:42] just you know that's what happens when
[1:24:44] you walk by revelation god just sees to
[1:24:46] it that you end up in the right place
[1:24:48] at the right time and the right person
[1:24:51] comes along
[1:24:52] hallelujah amen
[1:24:56] and all of this you know this
[1:24:58] incomprehensible loss
[1:25:00] none of it no fault of her own
[1:25:03] the loss of a father-in-law
[1:25:05] brother-in-law's and
[1:25:07] they were all close i mean they they
[1:25:08] stayed together as a family i think
[1:25:10] i think of the bond in my own family you
[1:25:12] know i i i've met people
[1:25:15] you know i don't want to get too broad
[1:25:17] and you know
[1:25:18] but but you know our family's always
[1:25:19] been close brother eddie sister gene
[1:25:22] you know we were always close sister
[1:25:24] debbie came into the family and became
[1:25:25] like a daughter
[1:25:26] and uh you know and and and my parents
[1:25:29] became like her parents because we
[1:25:31] after a while moved away she's lived
[1:25:33] mostly away from her parents
[1:25:35] since we've been married had some years
[1:25:37] there but the majority by far
[1:25:39] overwhelming
[1:25:40] majority have been away from her parents
[1:25:42] and her own siblings
[1:25:45] you know i my sons go out and find good
[1:25:48] girls and
[1:25:49] and our family's close and you know i
[1:25:52] i i know that that this daughter-in-law
[1:25:55] loved her father-in-law i know my
[1:25:57] daughter-in-laws love me i i think of
[1:25:59] the
[1:25:59] the devastation you know what what a
[1:26:02] devastation it would be to my girls if
[1:26:04] something happened to me
[1:26:05] what a devastation it would be to you
[1:26:07] know god forbid
[1:26:08] you know poor rachel her heart to be
[1:26:10] broken if something were to happen to
[1:26:12] chris
[1:26:13] because that's her brother-in-law who
[1:26:14] she loves and
[1:26:16] you know rachel loves matt and and matt
[1:26:18] loves katie
[1:26:19] and and and and they all love john we
[1:26:22] all love jonathan believe it or not
[1:26:25] no we do really
[1:26:30] right chris
[1:26:31] [Laughter]
[1:26:34] but but but i thought of the tragedy
[1:26:37] because this was real life all her
[1:26:40] security
[1:26:42] gone her safety gone
[1:26:46] you know she had to feel numb at such a
[1:26:48] loss as that i mean
[1:26:50] this isn't just a fairy tale this really
[1:26:52] happened to a lady
[1:26:54] amen this really happened to her it had
[1:26:57] to be
[1:26:58] you know how cruel how numb she must
[1:27:01] have felt
[1:27:02] you know all the loss and yet
[1:27:06] yet the hand of god was in
[1:27:10] every moment yes amen
[1:27:13] every step god's hand was controlling it
[1:27:18] all
[1:27:18] amen every step
[1:27:22] god's purpose was happening
[1:27:25] just remember friends your your life is
[1:27:28] happening
[1:27:28] yeah amen you're the word happening amen
[1:27:32] and i'm here to tell you that there has
[1:27:34] to be training
[1:27:35] there has to be character built in us
[1:27:40] this was all for purposes you think
[1:27:42] about you think back and put yourself in
[1:27:44] in ruth's place this is all for purposes
[1:27:48] that she couldn't possibly comprehend at
[1:27:51] the time
[1:27:52] not in her wildest imagination
[1:27:56] arrive in a strange land follow her
[1:27:57] mother-in-law in as far as she knew she
[1:28:00] had
[1:28:00] nothing and could expect nothing and yet
[1:28:03] god was going to raise her above every
[1:28:06] other woman
[1:28:07] in the land god knew what he was doing
[1:28:09] the whole time
[1:28:11] she would come to understand through
[1:28:13] trials
[1:28:17] that everything has a purpose
[1:28:21] everything and she came to understand
[1:28:26] through trials understand bride
[1:28:28] understand
[1:28:30] through your trials through your
[1:28:32] hardships
[1:28:33] through rejection through the having to
[1:28:36] exercise the patience of christ being a
[1:28:40] a fellow a companion in tribulation with
[1:28:43] john
[1:28:43] how many are willing to be a companion
[1:28:45] to john
[1:28:47] he represented you in the book of
[1:28:48] revelation
[1:28:53] it all has a purpose god had a vision
[1:28:55] here's the secret here's the simple
[1:28:57] truth
[1:28:58] what was it all about god had a vision
[1:29:00] of her
[1:29:03] say you mean god wasn't figuring it out
[1:29:06] as he went along no
[1:29:07] no no everything from the time she was a
[1:29:11] little girl
[1:29:12] and a moabite heathen nation heathen
[1:29:15] home heathen church heathen customs
[1:29:17] nine years old running around the house
[1:29:19] god saw her and knew her
[1:29:21] and had a vision for where she was gonna
[1:29:25] and every single piece and every single
[1:29:27] thing that was incited there
[1:29:29] was all god's plan and all
[1:29:32] god's doing
[1:29:35] even wow wow she's an unbeliever
[1:29:39] living in a heathen worshiping false
[1:29:41] gods
[1:29:42] the true god had his eye on her
[1:29:46] right got a few more minutes
[1:29:50] i'm not going to go too far with this
[1:29:52] because uh carry on sunday but enough
[1:29:55] i'm going to turn a corner you know
[1:29:58] brother branham
[1:29:59] talks about things he had to learn i was
[1:30:03] listening the other day to the breach
[1:30:06] where he talks about
[1:30:07] boaz being the goel uh the redeemer for
[1:30:10] ruth
[1:30:12] and it was so important brother branham
[1:30:13] he talks about in his own life how that
[1:30:16] he had had to learn by suffering
[1:30:19] you know he doesn't particularly mention
[1:30:21] it here he but we
[1:30:22] we know from the stories that he he had
[1:30:25] to learn to obey god in south africa
[1:30:28] because god had already told him what to
[1:30:29] do and he let a bunch of preachers
[1:30:31] get him in a pickle and force him and
[1:30:33] pressure him to do something different
[1:30:36] and when he went to god and god said and
[1:30:38] he said lord i'm in a jam because
[1:30:40] i let these men sponsor me and now it
[1:30:43] kind of really is bad if i don't do it
[1:30:45] the way they want to do it i've told
[1:30:46] them you said i should go here first
[1:30:48] they said no the logistics are bad you
[1:30:51] know it's not going to work the best way
[1:30:52] to do it is start here and we'll end up
[1:30:54] there
[1:30:54] he said but god told me to start here
[1:30:56] first then we can go there no brother
[1:30:58] branham
[1:30:59] you know we went to a lot of expense to
[1:31:01] bring you over here because brother adam
[1:31:02] had no money
[1:31:03] yeah so you know he made the same
[1:31:05] mistake luther made
[1:31:06] when luther let let that prince you know
[1:31:09] uh protect him and then he was kind of
[1:31:11] it's like a politician getting elected
[1:31:13] and then then his constituents come back
[1:31:15] and you know
[1:31:16] somebody once wants paid yeah
[1:31:19] and so god said all right you you go but
[1:31:22] you're going to pay a big price
[1:31:23] and brother branham walks out walks out
[1:31:25] door he comes in
[1:31:26] billy tries to tell him daddy you do
[1:31:27] whatever god says he said it's all right
[1:31:29] billy
[1:31:30] and brother branham comes out from
[1:31:32] praying and all these preachers even
[1:31:33] brother bosworth
[1:31:35] brother billy i i believe you've you've
[1:31:37] missed it this time no
[1:31:38] really son you know brother braham said
[1:31:41] that old veteran
[1:31:43] he said that hurt my heart worse than
[1:31:45] anything brother bosworth even doubted
[1:31:48] and and he says so brother branham went
[1:31:50] outside
[1:31:51] what is he doing prophets do do weird
[1:31:53] things
[1:31:55] he goes out and gets a bunch of leaves a
[1:31:57] bunch of leaves
[1:31:59] walks back in with a pile of leaves and
[1:32:00] puts it on their feet
[1:32:02] as a sign i have no idea what it meant
[1:32:06] but he caught an amoeba they caught
[1:32:08] amoeba the whole
[1:32:09] as the storm came ripped ripped their
[1:32:11] tents apart
[1:32:12] the whole thing was a disaster and yet
[1:32:14] still god got glory out of it we talked
[1:32:16] today about the meetings in durban
[1:32:18] amen and think of what it could have
[1:32:20] been if they if they'd went the way god
[1:32:22] told them to go brother branham had to
[1:32:24] learn that see
[1:32:26] he had to learn to go against family
[1:32:29] when when he wouldn't go to those
[1:32:30] pentecostals because his mother-in-law
[1:32:32] dug in
[1:32:33] and said you're not going to take my
[1:32:35] daughter and hope said no billy i'll go
[1:32:36] with he said no it's all right honey we
[1:32:37] won't do it.
[1:32:39] and brother branham called it the worst
[1:32:40] mistake he ever made
[1:32:42] he had to learn through hard trials to
[1:32:44] obey god
[1:32:46] even when he would say he's about to
[1:32:48] make a statement
[1:32:49] and he says ten thousand of my friends
[1:32:53] will leave me
[1:32:54] for what i'm about to say you think he
[1:32:58] didn't say it
[1:32:58] he went right and said it you know why
[1:33:01] because by that time he knew to obey
[1:33:04] god he knew that if ten thousand friends
[1:33:06] didn't like the word
[1:33:08] then he didn't need those ten thousand
[1:33:10] friends amen
[1:33:12] brother branham had to be trained he
[1:33:15] talks about there in the breach he said
[1:33:17] you know he said just like a a vision he
[1:33:20] said i see it and there's a certain
[1:33:21] there's a hat
[1:33:22] sitting there and and there's a child
[1:33:24] going to be healed
[1:33:25] and he had to learn not to move the hat
[1:33:28] yeah amen and that's hard to do friends
[1:33:30] sometimes in life
[1:33:32] you can see what needs to happen and
[1:33:34] you're going to try to help god
[1:33:36] don't move the hat say oh i need this
[1:33:39] obstacle out of the way if i could just
[1:33:41] get rid of this obstacle
[1:33:42] i'm going to get ahold of this obstacle
[1:33:44] and i'm going to move it don't
[1:33:46] touch it it's there for a purpose
[1:33:50] you can't move it let somebody else has
[1:33:53] to move it
[1:33:55] brother man says i can't do a thing he
[1:33:57] says i can't move it
[1:33:58] neither can i tell anyone else to move
[1:34:00] it he says i have to wait and then when
[1:34:03] someone else moves it without me saying
[1:34:05] a thing
[1:34:06] then i can step forward and say thus say
[1:34:08] it the lord amen
[1:34:10] see he almost killed a child one time
[1:34:12] doing that run
[1:34:13] he didn't wait for the hat to get in the

[1:39:36] wept over the calamity the calamity of
[1:39:38] it all
[1:39:39] but you know there was there there was
[1:39:42] there was a revelation that struck ruth
[1:39:44] and
[1:39:44] and maybe it wasn't even apparent to her
[1:39:47] but you know
[1:39:48] it was only god only had it disguised as
[1:39:51] calamity
[1:39:53] amen can i say that to you friends i
[1:39:55] don't know what might be happening in
[1:39:57] your life

[1:40:10] take it i can do all things through
[1:40:12] christ who strengthens me
[1:40:14] amen or but never caught that same
[1:40:16] revelation that ruth did
[1:40:19] god was behind it all you know i
[1:40:22] i i think about ruth's journey
[1:40:26] you ever you know if if you're
[1:40:29] if i'm somewhat of a romantic and i used
[1:40:32] to love to play that trick where
[1:40:34] i'm gonna maybe get my wife a new ring
[1:40:36] or something she's a ring freak she
[1:40:38] loves rings but
[1:40:39] but nothing else she doesn't care about
[1:40:42] anything in life because she loves loves
[1:40:44] hey man and so
[1:40:48] so um so i love this thing where you
[1:40:51] know i'd get a big box
[1:40:53] and it rings this little tiny it's a
[1:40:54] little little box like that so i'd get a
[1:40:56] big box
[1:40:57] and i would i'd put the ring in a bigger
[1:40:59] box and a bigger box and a bigger box
[1:41:01] and then put it in a big box and then
[1:41:02] close it up wow this looks like you're
[1:41:04] gonna get an
[1:41:05] amazing gift and she would open it
[1:41:09] and it's a smaller box and she opens it
[1:41:12] and it's a smaller box
[1:41:14] and it keeps getting smaller and smarter
[1:41:16] looking like it's getting less and less
[1:41:20] a lot of times you're looking at your
[1:41:21] life ruth could look at her life and say
[1:41:23] man it's getting less and less and less
[1:41:24] but actually there's a diamond ring down
[1:41:26] on the inside
[1:41:29] and when you get down to that last
[1:41:31] little box it's worth it all
[1:41:34] that's exactly what ruth was getting she
[1:41:37] was getting a diamond
[1:41:38] right she was getting uh she was getting
[1:41:41] in the sense of a word she was getting
[1:41:43] a diamond she was getting boaz she was
[1:41:45] getting she wasn't going to have to
[1:41:47] settle for handfuls of purpose
[1:41:49] if she got boaz she gets the whole field
[1:41:53] she gets the whole estate and so this
[1:41:56] revelation just keeps unfolding
[1:41:58] keeps unfolding you know there there
[1:42:01] this this inexplicable
[1:42:02] knowing that that it's hard to describe
[1:42:05] to the world but you just
[1:42:07] you can't quit you you know that okay
[1:42:10] i opened another box and there's another
[1:42:12] disappointment and another box and it's
[1:42:14] another disappointment
[1:42:15] well you just might as well quit i can't
[1:42:18] why do you keep
[1:42:19] opening boxes i don't know something
[1:42:21] tells me there's a payoff
[1:42:23] something tells me if i just keep
[1:42:25] narrowing it down and narrowing it down
[1:42:27] i'm going to get the best prize of all i
[1:42:29] don't need the big boxes i don't need
[1:42:31] the medium size give me that little
[1:42:33] bitty box as long as it's got the ring
[1:42:35] in it
[1:42:35] that's where we're at friends are
[1:42:37] there's a revelation there's a ring
[1:42:39] that's wrapped around your heart of
[1:42:41] divine love and you know what you you
[1:42:43] know what you know what it causes
[1:42:44] it caused you to say no matter what i
[1:42:46] can't quit why can't you quit i don't
[1:42:48] know i just can't
[1:42:49] that's really bad you got nothing but
[1:42:51] trouble i don't know but i can't quit
[1:42:53] i gotta go i gotta keep going i to keep
[1:42:55] moving

[1:43:42] followed every instruction that only
[1:43:44] gave her
