[6:03] bible calls him a covert
[6:05] from storm it's a stormy

[6:09] and so we sure appreciate the lord
[6:11] taking care of us amen god bless you all
[6:14] today
[6:15] amen and we want to just take a few
[6:18] moments hold up a second
[6:20] uh we want to i want to show you a
[6:22] couple pictures from yesterday and give
[6:24] you a little bit of a report
[6:26] um
[6:26] uh are you ready gideon um let me just
[6:29] let me just say this first
[6:31] so i was able to go over to cherokee on
[6:36] friday
[6:37] and do a little bit of recon and uh what
[6:41] that's it's gonna be amazing how it
[6:43] turned out
[6:44] and uh the lord taught me so much in
[6:47] that because i
[6:48] i was able to sharpen my vision on i
[6:51] knew what i wanted to do
[6:53] but how to go about it that was what i
[6:55] was really
[6:56] waiting my vision was clear and it's
[6:59] undaunted and remains crystal clear
[7:02] that i i really have a vision to work
[7:06] deeply into the cherokee tribal nation
[7:10] to let them know what god has done
[7:13] in this day
[7:14] amen raised up a prophet right from
[7:17] among their own people and they meant
[7:19] brother branham's grandmother a
[7:20] full-blooded cherokee right off the
[7:22] reservation
[7:23] and uh that's a lot brother branham said
[7:25] that that's what gave him that love of
[7:27] the wilderness was his native heritage
[7:30] and so
[7:31] you know they're they're unaware of that
[7:33] and there has never been that i'm aware
[7:35] of and i think i would be aware of it
[7:38] my mom would certainly be aware of it my
[7:40] dad but there has not been a real um
[7:45] that kind of an approach to that
[7:47] particular
[7:48] native american nation
[7:51] and
[7:52] so we were able to go there sister
[7:53] debbie and i and i did a little bit of
[7:54] recon we met
[7:56] brother jack i call him brother jack and
[7:58] he's uh he's actually teaches at a
[8:00] baptist sunday school amen so amen
[8:03] brother donald we got to hook another
[8:05] baptist amen
[8:06] praise the lord god to get his eyes to
[8:09] come open to see
[8:11] that what he has is awesome but there's
[8:13] more amen
[8:15] so you know if you've got a seven course
[8:17] meal don't sit one thing in front of me
[8:19] i want the whole seven course meal i'm
[8:22] appreciative of what's in front of me
[8:24] amen but i want i want all that god has
[8:28] and there's something about it you know
[8:30] when you
[8:31] when when you first began to respond to
[8:33] that eagle scream you just you there was
[8:35] a longing as brother kenny was singing
[8:38] there you know there's there's a deep
[8:40] cry something there's got to be more
[8:42] there's got to be more and i've heard
[8:44] that testimony from so many people
[8:46] who came from
[8:48] um you know their life as a christian in
[8:51] in denominational systems they were
[8:53] already loved the lord already believed
[8:55] god had already accepted christ but they
[8:58] just knew somewhere somehow there's got
[9:00] to be more than this
[9:02] and as soon as they heard that eagle
[9:04] scream wow
[9:06] a deep calling to a deep so we're
[9:08] trusting in that
[9:10] i realize that
[9:12] that i can't go as fast as i would like
[9:15] to go i mean i'm i just wanted to go in
[9:17] and just go i just want to go knock on
[9:19] the gates at the reservation and say i
[9:21] want to see the chief and i want to see
[9:22] the council
[9:23] i just wanted to go in and drop a bomb
[9:25] it's not going to work like that and so
[9:27] talking to them and meeting with with
[9:30] jack who's full-blooded there's only
[9:31] about 600 remaining
[9:33] on that
[9:35] on those tribal lands
[9:37] um
[9:38] where that are pure pure blood
[9:40] um and the rest have have intermarried
[9:43] and different things like that there's
[9:44] only a little more than 600 maybe
[9:46] according to to jack that's how many are
[9:48] there that's remaining and i just began
[9:51] to witness to him man i liked him a
[9:53] whole lot him and his wife
[9:55] and they seemed to take a shine to
[9:56] sister debbie and i
[9:58] and
[9:59] we started talking very easy and and i
[10:02] just began to kind of give him a little
[10:04] bit of my vision
[10:05] uh you know and just told him i said you
[10:07] know the
[10:09] the the cherokee nation you know those
[10:11] are real americans and
[10:13] and they're they're even unaware that
[10:15] god you know rose a prophet among their
[10:17] people bit of
[10:19] you know the the divine power and the
[10:20] miracles and the things that took place
[10:22] and the era that he lived in and the
[10:24] testimonies of all the uh famous you
[10:27] know uh religious leaders of his day and
[10:30] the things they testified about him and
[10:32] said you know and even to this day some
[10:34] of those great some of the greatest
[10:36] um
[10:37] some of the some of the leading
[10:39] uh religious leaders that we have today
[10:42] declare openly that william branham had
[10:44] by far the greatest supernatural gift
[10:47] and was a humble godly christian man
[10:50] and uh and uh and and that that's what
[10:53] the people who testify who knew it and
[10:55] know it authoritatively say about it and
[10:58] i said
[10:59] and he said well and and just uh telling
[11:01] a few little things from his ministry
[11:04] and even in my own ministry from
[11:05] overseas and different things like that
[11:07] and the miracles we've seen
[11:08] it really you could tell my wife and i
[11:11] we could we both left there feeling so
[11:14] informed on how we're going to approach
[11:17] this and it turns out
[11:18] that actually uh brother george i don't
[11:21] think i've said this to you yet turns
[11:23] out you had the exact model that's going
[11:25] to work perfectly and brother george you
[11:27] know has uh rented a pavilion you're
[11:30] going to see it here in a minute it's in
[11:31] the cherokee park
[11:33] you're going to see streams of water and
[11:35] rivers that i played in as a kid sister
[11:37] debbie i said honey as soon as you see
[11:38] it you're going to remember and she said
[11:39] my goodness how many times my daddy had
[11:42] us up here and she said i played right
[11:43] out there and
[11:44] and she remembered it immediately and
[11:47] when i was there on friday you're going
[11:48] to see some a few shots of pictures and
[11:51] videos there it was early on a saturday
[11:52] morning
[11:53] no one was really there there's one or
[11:55] two people walking around but when i was
[11:56] there on friday
[11:58] families were there you know
[12:00] with picnics and the kids were the
[12:02] rivers on both sides at least one side
[12:04] his stream is weightable
[12:07] there were kids out there waiting all up
[12:09] and down at people fishing on both sides
[12:12] and so what we're going to do is i
[12:14] realize that talking to jack and gail
[12:17] that you know i'm not going to be able
[12:19] to just go to the to the main thing i
[12:22] can't even i'm gonna have to build some
[12:23] relationships i gotta build some rapport
[12:26] we gotta we gotta meet some people we
[12:28] got a social network as it were we gotta
[12:30] shake some hands and so
[12:32] we're gonna we're our plan is to go
[12:34] there
[12:35] uh on i think it's saturday the 18th i
[12:38] believe
[12:39] and we're going to have music and we're
[12:41] going to bring in some food and we're
[12:43] just going to see what the lord will do
[12:46] with that if it's nothing more than just
[12:48] meeting and greeting and getting people
[12:51] to understand and begin to build a
[12:52] little bit of rapport
[12:54] jack told me that he absolutely you know
[12:57] will get me into uh on to the on to the
[13:00] reservation and and he thinks it's
[13:02] perfectly doable that i could probably
[13:04] go right into the council meeting of the
[13:06] elders and pour my heart out to them uh
[13:09] so we're gonna we're gonna start small
[13:11] and we're gonna take a few steps because
[13:13] there's it's unquestionably i have a
[13:16] burden to do it amen brother eddie had a
[13:19] burden sister gene has a burden um and
[13:22] uh i i want to do it i i it's never been
[13:24] done the way that i envision it and
[13:27] that's what we want to do brother
[13:29] stephen and sister emily are actually
[13:30] flying in there to bring instruments and
[13:32] we're going to play music and some of
[13:34] our musicians from here going and
[13:36] uh so if you want to go and bring your
[13:39] kids they can play in the river you can
[13:41] bring some fishing poles you might need
[13:43] a fishing license i don't know you might
[13:45] be to go to walmart when you get to
[13:46] north carolina and buy you a
[13:48] one-day fishing license but
[13:50] people were were fishing both sides the
[13:52] one on this side is a little deeper and
[13:54] a little more fast moving and it looked
[13:56] like
[13:58] anglers were over there they were
[14:00] letting the kids fish over here but you
[14:02] could do either one
[14:04] and we've got to go in don't know where
[14:06] that's coming from gee is that my
[14:08] microphone you think
[14:09] amen i don't i don't know okay all right
[14:12] all right we'll just see
[14:14] make sure to all make sure all other
[14:15] mics are off all other mics are muted
[14:18] except this one and that way we'll cut
[14:20] it down to the process of elimination
[14:23] and so
[14:25] so we're i'm going to show you just a
[14:26] few pictures of what the park looks like
[14:28] bear in mind this is an early saturday
[14:30] morning there's really no one there but
[14:32] it'll give you
[14:33] some idea of what you're going to see
[14:35] when you come right g-man let's see the
[14:37] pics
[14:39] if we can make it work
[14:41] so i put that one on purpose because i
[14:43] just want to see that smile kills me
[14:44] every time
[14:45] so uh there's sister debbie and i
[14:48] where i tell her i said honey you can
[14:49] get away with anything because that
[14:50] smile will get you off the hook
[14:52] amen and so
[14:54] um that that's the in the background
[14:56] there and that's that's one side of the
[14:59] river there's actually
[15:00] in this direction a whole another the
[15:02] river goes down both sides like a little
[15:04] island you actually have to cross over
[15:06] walkways to get to it next
[15:09] there's the one of the walkways you have
[15:10] to go how that smile you have to walk
[15:12] over that i have to keep concentrating
[15:15] here you have to walk over that that
[15:17] gangway there's like four or five of
[15:19] them and there's a one there's the
[15:20] number one pavilion brother george in
[15:22] the background okay next one g
[15:25] uh here is our number two pavilion now i
[15:27] i i made some notes that that i'm gonna
[15:30] need to take my handheld blower because
[15:32] the park is not
[15:34] it's not kept as good as i would like to
[15:36] see it we're gonna blow everything off
[15:38] and uh clean it up a little bit it's got
[15:40] power as you can see those lights are
[15:41] actually on
[15:42] and uh we're gonna maybe take some of
[15:44] those those paper table top cloths that
[15:47] you see the sisters do out here and they
[15:49] have rubber bands that go and make them
[15:51] wrap around for the win
[15:53] um we might we might grill some stuff we
[15:55] might order in some pizzas that's still
[15:57] being debated uh let's see i think we
[16:00] have a couple video shots still got
[16:01] another still picture gideon i think i
[16:02] have one more that's the that's the
[16:04] number two you can see the river this is
[16:06] the weightable side where all the kids
[16:08] were playing all right getting let's see
[16:09] the couple video shots
[16:18] i got volume
[16:20] i may i may not be talking i don't
[16:22] remember
[16:24] maybe
[16:25] i'm just taking a panorama i thought i
[16:27] was headed some words but it's okay if
[16:29] all they're seeing
[16:30] uh this is the waitable side this is
[16:32] where kids were playing everywhere
[16:36] on the far side it gets a little deep
[16:38] but um this just kind of pans around the
[16:41] park that's looking back at number one
[16:43] or no i think that's number two pavilion
[16:45] right there
[16:46] and then the other river you could see
[16:48] it on that far side right there
[16:50] um all right do i got one more video
[16:52] clip maybe
[16:55] yeah
[16:56] there's one of the walkways
[16:59] and this is we're just panning straight
[17:01] around
[17:03] that's the waitable side i don't know if
[17:05] the camera will come all the way around
[17:06] you couldn't see the river a little bit
[17:08] till you walk over near the other side
[17:10] and then it comes into good view
[17:12] i think that's the number two pavilion
[17:14] where we'll be meeting
[17:16] so that'll give you an idea yeah let's
[17:18] see if it goes on around yeah there
[17:20] there's the other side now that there's
[17:23] actually fat no that's the bank on the
[17:24] other side you can't see down in there's
[17:26] a fast moving uh
[17:28] river right there probably 20 feet wide
[17:30] that's the side that a lot of fishermen
[17:32] were fishing so
[17:34] if you want to have a nice little time
[17:36] in cherokee it's a popular tourist
[17:38] destination
[17:40] and
[17:41] maybe even take your family up for a day
[17:43] in advance on friday and
[17:45] and tour around and then saturday uh
[17:47] morning we'll be in the park
[17:49] um
[17:50] picking and grinning
[17:52] amen and singing and and fellowshipping
[17:55] and just having a good time as many of
[17:58] you as want to go are welcome to go as
[18:00] few if we just have a we've got a few
[18:02] musicians going that we know of and
[18:04] anybody else want to bring your kids for
[18:06] a nice day
[18:07] my we used to go up there as kids all
[18:08] the time kids love that place so
[18:11] uh it's awesome now
[18:13] i said all that and i got a caveat all
[18:15] right
[18:16] so the caveat is this
[18:18] that we may
[18:20] have to push the dates back
[18:23] and if we have to push them back too far
[18:26] it'll get cold in the mountains and we'd
[18:27] have to push it off to the spring so i
[18:29] need you to pray and the reason is is
[18:32] because there's a lot of fear up in that
[18:34] area over covid
[18:35] and um they're actually some of the
[18:38] schools it's not that they're spiking so
[18:40] bad in fact is some of the
[18:42] gale who works in the school said it
[18:44] doesn't even make sense they'll let two
[18:46] they'll send two kids home
[18:48] because they tested positive and they'll
[18:50] let their siblings who live in the same
[18:52] house come
[18:53] so go figure she said it's just
[18:56] ridiculous and some of the school zones
[18:58] are saying we're gonna we're gonna shut
[19:00] down others are still open and but jack
[19:02] did say to me that that they they will
[19:05] keep me informed and we've got to make a
[19:08] kind of a a go or not go decision pretty
[19:10] soon let me just say that as of today
[19:13] i'm still planning to do it on september
[19:15] the 18th
[19:16] but it could be that i'll have to come
[19:19] back and say
[19:20] things are starting to lock down and
[19:22] they won't even jax that they won't even
[19:24] let you in the park and even if they
[19:26] would nobody will even come he said
[19:27] because everybody is is afraid so
[19:30] i hate that covet devil you know it's
[19:32] just trying to get in the way of things
[19:35] so how about we pray
[19:37] and to say lord help us to have an
[19:39] opening there so that we don't have to
[19:42] wait i know the devil would love to
[19:43] cancel it but we're going to try
[19:46] to to have that but i will keep you
[19:48] posted
[19:50] week by week as i'm in contact with gail
[19:52] and jack and and gail being in the
[19:54] school system she has a real good feel
[19:57] for what's going on and jack knows what
[19:59] happens uh on the reservation because if
[20:01] the chief shuts it down it's shut down
[20:04] and even
[20:05] because that is even cherokee
[20:07] the city is part of the tribal
[20:10] reservation but it's where everybody can
[20:12] go it's their tourism area the other
[20:14] section is uh is gated and you you can
[20:17] only get in there by invitation uh
[20:19] unless you have unless your card
[20:21] carrying so that's the where jack will
[20:23] have to try to get me in so we pray for
[20:25] that friends we hope to do that on
[20:27] saturday the 18th of september
[20:30] amen praise the lord let's stand back to
[20:32] our feet this morning thank you for that
[20:35] time i will uh
[20:36] be studious on my sermon this morning i
[20:38] realize i've already took it taking
[20:40] quite a bit of time
[20:41] but i want to go into a thought that the
[20:44] lord put on my heart
[20:46] uh actually uh from the sermon i got
[20:49] this sermon wednesday night from brother
[20:52] brad's sermon my goodness what what a
[20:54] what an awesome job our brother
[20:56] did i i went back in the back office and
[20:59] i said brother brad i made so many notes
[21:01] i already got sermons off of that i'm
[21:03] gonna
[21:03] and i'm gonna preach on it so i've been
[21:05] thinking about it all week and i want to
[21:07] speak to you today on a single title
[21:11] called opportunity amen opportunity i
[21:14] want to look at job chapter 14 and we're
[21:17] going to go in one verse the book of job
[21:19] right before psalms the last book before
[21:21] the book of psalms job 14
[21:24] and we're going to just read the opening
[21:26] verse and then we're going to go
[21:28] to a little place a little easier to
[21:29] find over in romans 8 but let's look at
[21:32] job 14
[21:33] and verse 1.
[21:38] man that is born of a woman
[21:41] is a few days
[21:43] and full of trouble amen let's read it
[21:47] again
[21:48] man that is born of a woman
[21:50] is a few days
[21:52] and full of trouble now if it's man born
[21:55] of a woman i'm pretty sure that would
[21:56] include everybody
[21:58] so i'm pretty sure that nobody is exempt
[22:01] from the the second half of that verse
[22:04] amen man that is born of a woman is of a
[22:07] few days and full of trouble i want to
[22:11] look at romans chapter 8.
[22:21] and in romans chapter 8 we're going to
[22:23] begin
[22:24] at verse 12
[22:27] romans 8
[22:30] and verse 12.
[22:34] therefore brethren
[22:36] we are debtors not to the flesh
[22:39] to live after the flesh
[22:41] for if you live after the flesh
[22:44] ye shall die
[22:46] but
[22:48] however
[22:50] however having said that see
[22:53] if you live to the flesh
[22:55] you shall die but
[22:58] however
[22:59] if ye through the spirit do mortify the
[23:02] deeds of the body guess what
[23:05] good news
[23:08] you shall live
[23:10] now i would ask anybody to give me
[23:12] more polar opposites between dying and
[23:15] living
[23:16] there's not anything more polar opposite
[23:19] than dying
[23:21] or living
[23:22] amen
[23:24] then could i suggest to you there would
[23:26] be nothing more polar opposite than
[23:28] living by the flesh or living by the
[23:30] spirit amen amen
[23:33] are you half dead
[23:35] are you half alive
[23:37] so you can't live half to the flesh and
[23:40] half to the spirit
[23:41] if you live to the flesh you die if you
[23:44] live to the spirit you live
[23:46] amen
[23:47] all right let's look on verse 13 or i'm
[23:50] sorry 4 for verse 14
[23:53] for as many
[23:54] as are led by the spirit of god they are
[23:57] the sons of god
[23:59] for ye have not received the spirit of
[24:02] bondage again to fear not you
[24:05] no not you
[24:07] a lot of people have
[24:09] not you
[24:10] say praise god
[24:12] amen many have but you have not received
[24:16] the spirit of bondage again to fear
[24:19] you have received not everybody has
[24:23] but you have received the spirit of
[24:26] adoption
[24:28] whereby we
[24:29] we say to god you're my dad
[24:32] amen
[24:34] you're my dad
[24:36] amen
[24:37] so we might be
[24:39] brothers from a different mother but we
[24:42] have the same father
[24:44] amen so let's look at it again
[24:48] for ye have not received the spirit of
[24:51] bondage again to fear
[24:53] but ye have received the spirit of
[24:56] adoption whereby we cry abba father
[25:00] the spirit itself
[25:03] that one that helps you to live
[25:05] the spirit itself beareth witness with
[25:08] our spirit
[25:09] that we are the children of god
[25:12] well
[25:13] since all that's true
[25:15] if children
[25:16] then heirs
[25:18] and if we're heirs we're heirs of god
[25:22] amen
[25:24] and
[25:25] joint heirs
[25:27] with christ
[25:28] now you know you know why that's
[25:30] important
[25:31] because you can be an heir and not have
[25:33] any not have uh gotten any inheritance
[25:37] see
[25:38] it doesn't necessarily mean that
[25:39] anything's been distributed to you as an
[25:42] heir of god that's what that word means
[25:44] you are an heir but that doesn't mean
[25:46] you've got anything
[25:47] but as a joint heir with christ it means
[25:50] you actually
[25:52] it literally means that you are standing
[25:55] beside of christ and he is reaching into
[25:58] the father's treasure chest and you are
[26:00] reaching right beside him
[26:02] you are joint heirs with christ amen
[26:07] if
[26:08] here it is
[26:09] if so be
[26:10] that we suffer with him
[26:13] that we may be also
[26:15] glorified
[26:17] together
[26:18] is that your desire
[26:20] amen let's pray master we thank you for
[26:23] your word
[26:25] and i commit myself into your hands now
[26:27] in jesus name amen god bless you friends
[26:29] you can be seated
[26:43] amen
[26:46] wait for all the transition
[26:50] amen
[26:53] all right
[26:54] now
[26:57] i'm speaking to you today
[26:59] on a single word
[27:01] opportunity
[27:04] and
[27:04] i think that
[27:07] i've been able
[27:10] in paul's
[27:12] letter to the romans
[27:14] in this eighth chapter
[27:16] i think that i have
[27:18] shown you
[27:21] tremendous opportunity amen
[27:24] i mean
[27:25] could i offer you any greater
[27:28] opportunity than to say
[27:30] how many would like to have eternal life
[27:34] how many would like to know
[27:37] that you've passed from death
[27:39] unto life
[27:41] you're safe
[27:42] you're home free you can never be
[27:45] condemned you can never be accused of
[27:48] sin before god you are completely
[27:52] bought purchased signed sealed and as
[27:55] far as the word of god you're already in
[27:59] heavenly places in christ jesus
[28:03] now i don't know about you but i think
[28:06] that would be far superior news than
[28:09] saying hey guess what i'm looking
[28:11] through your stuff and found you won the
[28:13] lottery you're 50 million dollars richer
[28:16] i found a ticket you haven't turned in
[28:17] yet guess what you got 50 million
[28:19] dollars say wow i wish that was me i'm
[28:22] giving you something that makes that
[28:23] seem like peanuts
[28:26] like peanuts
[28:27] that's nothing
[28:28] that'll that'll you you know
[28:31] some people have so much money there
[28:34] they'll never be able to spend it the
[28:36] antichrist will end up with it anyhow
[28:39] you see so jesus would say don't lay up
[28:42] your treasures here
[28:45] where thieves and robbers can get in and
[28:47] steal it from you where corruption and
[28:50] rust and moth can get in and but lay up
[28:53] treasures in heaven where there are no
[28:56] thieves
[28:57] there is no corruption there
[29:00] nothing can ever take i'm offering you
[29:02] something today that is so glorious and
[29:05] guess what you get to keep it
[29:08] you get to keep it nobody can take it
[29:10] from you
[29:11] even you can't forsake it even you can't
[29:14] lose it
[29:16] that you're that you have the ability
[29:18] not only
[29:20] in the world to come
[29:22] but you have the opportunity if you'd
[29:25] like it if you want it amen amen i can't
[29:28] force you to take it
[29:30] god won't force you to take it
[29:32] but he offers you an opportunity today
[29:35] to be free of the bondage of your fallen
[29:38] flesh and live righteously
[29:42] live holy
[29:43] wake up smelling the the air of
[29:46] cleanness
[29:48] be able to lay your head on your pillow
[29:50] at night and be content i'm offering you
[29:52] the joy of the lord i'm offering you the
[29:56] the oil of gladness
[29:58] some of you need it
[30:00] i'm here to tell you some of you need it
[30:02] not because you're a bad person but
[30:03] because life has really piled on you and
[30:06] you need the oil of gladness guess what
[30:09] i'm a delivery man today and i assure
[30:11] you that god will pour on you the oil of
[30:14] gladness in this service
[30:17] if you want it
[30:19] amen
[30:20] amen if you want it
[30:22] come on it's up to you
[30:24] amen i'm preaching on opportunity today
[30:29] there's never been
[30:31] a greater
[30:32] opportunity
[30:34] man that's born of a woman and we read
[30:36] in our opening text
[30:38] man say what if i don't take god's deal
[30:41] okay here's your life
[30:43] man born of a woman is a few days and
[30:46] full of trouble
[30:49] so there you go
[30:51] there you go america there you go
[30:52] beaufort there you go world there you go
[30:54] bethel tabernacle
[30:56] it's not rocket science
[30:59] there's no smoke and mirrors
[31:01] i i don't i'm not i'm not trying to whip
[31:04] up music
[31:06] i'm giving you an alternative
[31:08] you're born under a death curse
[31:12] christ offers you to do away with that
[31:15] it's really that simple
[31:17] the gospel is really that simple
[31:20] accepting
[31:22] the in faith in christ
[31:25] and and what was accomplished for you
[31:28] that day on calvary
[31:30] and reading about how that god came down
[31:33] to live inside of his church and those
[31:35] men standing there
[31:38] amen and jesus ascended up into the
[31:41] cloud
[31:42] probably one of the most supernatural
[31:43] things they'd ever seen
[31:44] now he had given them instructions very
[31:48] clear
[31:49] instructions that weren't complicated
[31:51] didn't take a law degree
[31:53] didn't take a college education and he
[31:56] said simply this
[31:57] go in
[31:58] terry until you be endued with power
[32:03] okay well what do we do you just go
[32:04] terry i know that but i mean when we get
[32:06] there what do we do you just wait
[32:09] but i mean what do we
[32:10] what do we do yeah you just wait yes
[32:15] well how do i know that that'll work
[32:17] because it's a promise
[32:19] and i'm telling you
[32:21] have i ever lied to you no jesus you've
[32:23] never lied then go into the city and
[32:26] wait on me
[32:27] i'll be alone
[32:29] just wait on me i will keep my word well
[32:33] how how are you going to do it don't
[32:34] worry i'll keep my word what's it going
[32:36] to look like don't worry amen
[32:39] as brother brad was preaching god's got
[32:41] this
[32:43] god's got this he just said to them go
[32:45] stand still in upper room i got this
[32:47] i'll be along when you're coming just
[32:50] wait till i get there
[32:51] and when i get there it'll be worth the
[32:54] wait
[32:56] now the beauty say
[32:58] well man
[33:00] in this rapid age you're going to tell
[33:02] me to wait actually the good news is
[33:04] today that i have better news for you
[33:08] today
[33:09] you have the opportunity to hear better
[33:11] news from me
[33:13] than those men heard from jesus
[33:16] so that's pretty cocky no it's not
[33:18] not once you understand what my news is
[33:20] you'll it'll go oh yeah right
[33:22] say what's your news you don't have to
[33:23] wait
[33:25] there's no more waiting why'd they have
[33:27] to wait because it had to be the 50th
[33:28] day there was 10 days left it only been
[33:30] it only been 40 days since its
[33:32] resurrection so prophecy couldn't be
[33:34] broken
[33:36] but guess what you don't have to wait
[33:39] you don't have to wait 10 days you have
[33:40] to wait 10 hours you have to wait 10
[33:42] minutes you don't have to wait 10
[33:44] seconds you can have the indwelling life
[33:47] of christ living inside of you pouring
[33:50] blessing on you giving you overcoming
[33:52] power how many want overcoming power
[33:54] my goodness i walk around in this sinful
[33:57] world and i'm sorry but i can't relate
[34:00] to the garbage that this world loves and
[34:03] feeds on it to me it's a vexation of
[34:06] spirit and i'm constantly going to bed
[34:09] saying lord cleanse my mind cleanse my
[34:11] heart and i'm constantly waking up every
[34:13] morning saying lord your mercies are new
[34:15] every morning and i need to avail myself
[34:17] because i don't want to walk around
[34:21] contaminated
[34:22] amen
[34:24] i don't amen
[34:26] i'm going to take my opportunity
[34:28] amen
[34:29] and jesus gave them an opportunity said
[34:32] now go and wait now you know the curious
[34:33] thing there was paul said
[34:36] that more than 500 people
[34:39] were standing there and heard
[34:42] jesus christ say that amen go and wait
[34:47] until you be endued with power
[34:50] and after 10 days there was only 120
[34:53] left out of above 500 people
[34:57] amen
[34:58] say
[35:00] what happened to other people
[35:02] i don't know
[35:04] say
[35:05] what do you know i know what happened to
[35:06] the 120.
[35:08] well how do you know that because i've
[35:09] had the same experience
[35:11] i can't tell you why the other ones
[35:13] didn't wait i can't tell you why they
[35:15] didn't take the opportunity i can't tell
[35:18] you today why people don't take the
[35:20] opportunity i can't tell you today why
[35:23] god offers to heal you of any disease
[35:26] and sickness and yet i've met people who
[35:28] don't want to be healed
[35:31] i've met people who have gotten trapped
[35:33] in psychological trap they love the pity
[35:38] and you begin to talk to them about
[35:39] healing they get an attitude yeah
[35:42] i i i don't understand why people
[35:46] continue to feed on the poisons of the
[35:48] world they're not happy
[35:51] they're all the time sad they're all the
[35:52] time stressed out they're all the time
[35:54] banging their head and i say i got a
[35:57] remedy for that oh i don't want that
[35:59] i don't understand that i don't get that
[36:02] i love freedom i love liberty i love
[36:06] cleanness i love purity
[36:09] if you don't i don't get you but i'm i'm
[36:12] telling you i'm giving you an
[36:14] opportunity today is that if you'll just
[36:17] forget the
[36:18] your trials and just give them to christ
[36:20] don't worry he'll fix it i don't care
[36:22] what the problem is he can fix it
[36:27] in a day when when when what ought to be
[36:30] happening is you ought to be getting
[36:32] more on fire many are getting colder and
[36:36] colder say why is that happening easy
[36:39] answer
[36:40] amen the love of many
[36:42] because the love of the world the love
[36:45] of many shall wax cold amen
[36:48] amen
[36:50] because people enjoy the world more than
[36:53] they want the liberties and the joys and
[36:56] the happiness and you say you don't know
[36:59] what kind of trials i've been through
[37:00] you don't know how many what i've been
[37:01] through
[37:02] don't give me your trials i promise mine
[37:04] have probably been more
[37:06] i'm in a leadership role my life is on
[37:09] the line my soul is on the line i can be
[37:11] held accountable to god for every word i
[37:13] say to groups of people tell me you live
[37:16] under that amen
[37:19] tell me you've lived a day under that
[37:22] i've got a target on my back
[37:24] the devil hates me
[37:27] my picture hangs in hell on the most
[37:29] wanted most wanted poster
[37:35] some guys i was listening to a preacher
[37:36] one time he said man i heard some bad
[37:38] news i said oh brother what happened he
[37:39] said i found out the devil hates me
[37:41] he hates me
[37:43] i said
[37:44] that's bad news he goes no that's good
[37:45] news i'm just kidding it's good news
[37:47] i'm glad he hates me listen friends
[37:51] you know i i i br brother branham talked
[37:53] about it i could talk about it i i was
[37:55] you know 26 years you don't do this 26
[37:58] years and not have scars and wounds and
[37:59] deep deep deep deep wounds
[38:03] and scars and it takes a toll and i'm
[38:06] not it takes a toll on you mentally it
[38:08] takes and i'm a baby compared to some
[38:11] like you get some pastors who have been
[38:13] more than double that
[38:15] i don't know how they're alive
[38:18] and and and so you know it comes back to
[38:21] sometimes what i what i've had to say
[38:24] here before i said here i made this
[38:25] statement you know and boy in this age
[38:28] it's it just
[38:30] it just needs to be said almost every
[38:32] service
[38:33] that sometimes my best advice to you
[38:36] is you say your best advice surely
[38:38] you're about to say i need to pray more
[38:40] well that's good advice but that might
[38:42] not even be your best advice
[38:44] well i need to read my bible more you
[38:45] man you can never read your bible too
[38:47] much that's excellent advice
[38:49] but sometimes people
[38:51] can't get the deliverance
[38:54] that reading their bible brings
[38:56] they can't get the freedom and the joy
[38:59] and the happiness that prayer brings
[39:02] because they can't get over their self
[39:05] and they're too jacked up
[39:07] and too complex and too mad and too hurt
[39:12] do you know that paul addressed that do
[39:14] you know that the apostle said listen i
[39:17] think it was paul might been one of the
[39:18] other apostles
[39:20] and he said listen
[39:21] i got a remedy for when you're feeling
[39:23] sorry for yourself
[39:25] he said consider christ jesus
[39:29] who suffered such a contradiction
[39:32] of sinners against himself
[39:35] lest ye be weary
[39:36] and faint in your own mind unless you
[39:38] think you've got a big problem
[39:40] here was jesus completely innocent
[39:44] never done wrong thought wrong spoke
[39:46] wrong of anybody
[39:48] was there only to help and give his life
[39:50] was there to heal their sick and feed
[39:52] the hungry and raise the dead and was
[39:54] there to go about the bible says he went
[39:55] about doing good and they they murdered
[39:58] him
[39:59] and not he said well that's pretty bad
[40:01] that's that's a that's
[40:03] nothing
[40:05] that they that they murdered the bible
[40:07] says that when he when he was suffering
[40:09] that he would see his seed and and he
[40:12] would be content with his murder amen he
[40:14] would actually rejoice you know why
[40:16] because he knew he was getting you
[40:18] so getting murdered wasn't jesus main
[40:20] problem you know the thing that made him
[40:22] cry in another language
[40:25] you know the thing that maybe he he was
[40:27] so in such agony
[40:29] that his blood separated and and his
[40:33] sweat looked like blood and that's a
[40:35] medical condition that is only brought
[40:37] on by the most extreme almost
[40:39] unimaginable stress
[40:41] that can literally make your your sweat
[40:43] look like blood
[40:45] you say because everybody hated him no
[40:47] because they were beating him no
[40:49] he'll see his seed and he'll be happy
[40:52] actually when he got murdered the bible
[40:55] said that that god committed him to that
[40:59] that it actually
[41:00] you ready for this it actually pleased
[41:03] god
[41:04] to bruise him that way
[41:06] he said i thought god loved him he did
[41:09] do you know the thing that broke jesus
[41:11] heart more than anything
[41:14] was that even god
[41:16] forsook him
[41:18] amen and he went to calvary as a man
[41:22] and died
[41:23] and said eli
[41:25] eli
[41:26] la masa boxing
[41:29] being interpreted my god
[41:32] my
[41:33] my
[41:34] god
[41:35] you've been with me my whole life you're
[41:37] all i care about
[41:39] i live i've not even come to do i i'm
[41:42] not i it's written about me in the
[41:44] scrolls i've come to do thy will that's
[41:46] the only reason i'm here and you've left
[41:48] me
[41:52] and he
[41:54] who knew no sin
[41:56] became sin
[41:58] and took on all of your sin though he
[42:01] had never done it you did it
[42:04] you made the choices to do it you still
[42:07] make those choices to do it but every
[42:10] sin you've ever committed and every sin
[42:12] you will ever commit are met in christ

[42:26] who endured such a contradiction of
[42:29] sinners against himself
