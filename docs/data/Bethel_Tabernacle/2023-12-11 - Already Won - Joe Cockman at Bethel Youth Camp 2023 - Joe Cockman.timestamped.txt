[0:00] so uh this song has a special meaning to
[0:05] it for me uh couple months ago uh my
[0:08] pastor said something that uh really
[0:11] struck me and it really touched me it uh
[0:15] he said that we're not fighting for
[0:17] victory but rather we're fighting from a
[0:20] position of Victory and I just think
[0:23] that's so powerful to know we know it's
[0:25] already won and we can fight knowing
[0:28] that so uh I wrote this song uh in light
[0:32] of
[0:34] [Music]
[0:50] that I go to
[0:53] war and every
[0:58] day the battles are in my
[1:04] mind and I fight so hard but too much on
[1:09] my
[1:10] plates when the battle was never
