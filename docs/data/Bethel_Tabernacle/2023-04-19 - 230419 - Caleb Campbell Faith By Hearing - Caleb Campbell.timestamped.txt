[12:53] I told brother Tony [music] before
[12:55] service he was in the music room. I said
[12:57] I'm not singing no specials today.
[13:00] I [music] never sing a special. You have
[13:03] a request upon your heart this evening.
[13:06] always want to remember my children.
[13:09] Somebody asked me [music] said, "You
[13:10] never mention
[13:13] Carolyn.
[13:14] She's one of my children."
[13:17] That's what I said, "Are you trying to
[13:18] make me feel bad?"
[13:22] I always remember all of my children, my
[13:24] grandchildren. [music] I do have
[13:26] grandchildren, four of them. have a son
[13:28] over in the Middle East in the Navy
[13:30] playing
[13:33] explosive ordinance demolition
[13:37] uh deep sea diving, jumping out of
[13:39] airplanes and [music] all that. So I
[13:41] pray for him also that the Lord keeps
[13:43] him safe. Amen.
[13:47] Let's [music] pray.
[13:49] I love you, Lord.
[13:51] I love you for all that [music] you do
[13:55] and I praise you this evening. Father, I
[13:58] saw some hands that [music] were lifted.
[14:00] Lord, you know what's behind that hand.
[14:04] Father, most of all in our hearts, we
[14:06] want to draw [music] closer to you.
[14:08] Those that we know that don't have a
[14:10] born again experience. We pray that they
[14:12] would get one. That you would draw them
[14:14] closer to you, Father. [music] that they
[14:16] could submit themselves to you, Lord,
[14:18] and then they could overcome [music] all
[14:21] things. I pray that you bless the tithes
[14:23] and offerings this evening. Remember all
[14:25] of those, Lord, that are not feeling
[14:27] [music] well this evening. Father, we
[14:30] pray that you would just touch each and
[14:31] every one. Raise them up in fullness of
[14:33] health, Father.
[14:35] Lord, we love you this evening, Lord.
[14:37] The precious ministering [music] of your
[14:39] word this evening, Father, magnify it to
[14:42] our hearts,
[14:44] Lord.
[14:45] I open my heart,
[14:48] Lord, that you could transform me into
[14:51] your [music] image. Bless the tithes and
[14:53] offerings, Father. Bless the cheerful
[14:55] giver. Bless those that are streaming.
[14:58] We ask these things, [music] Father, in
[15:00] the allsufficient name of Jesus Christ.
[15:03] Amen.
[15:06] You may be seated.
[15:10] Brother Aaron's going to give us a
[15:12] selection tonight. Let's give him a
[15:14] hand.
[15:16] [applause]
[15:52] [music]
[15:58] [music]
[16:02] [music]
[16:07] [music]
[16:14] [music]
[16:15] Are you disappointed?
[16:20] Are you desperate for help?
[16:25] You know [music] what it's like to
[16:29] only shove yourself. [music]
[16:34] You start to believe [music]
[16:39] you don't have what it takes
[16:44] cuz it's all you [music] can do
[16:46] [singing] just to move much less finish
[16:50] the race.
[16:54] But don't forget
[16:57] [music]
[16:59] what lies ahead.
[17:04] Almost
[17:06] [music] home, brother. It won't be long.
[17:12] Soon all your burdens
[17:15] [music]
[17:16] will be gone.
[17:22] With all your strength, sister, [music]
[17:27] run on, run free. Hold up your [music]
[17:32] head. Keep pressing
[17:36] [music] on.
[17:38] We are almost home.
[17:43] [music] Well, this road will be long,
[17:48] [music] but you win in the end.
[17:54] simply [music] because of Jesus in us.
[17:57] It's not if, but when. [music]
[18:02] So take joy in [singing] the journey.
[18:06] Even when it feels long. [music]
[18:12] Oh, find strength in each step, knowing
[18:15] heaven is cheering you on.
[18:21] We are almost [music]
[18:25] brother. It won't be long. Soon all your
[18:31] burdens

[18:39] With all your strength, sister run
[18:46] free. Hold up your [music] head. Keep
[18:51] pressing
[18:53] on. [music]
[18:56] We are almost
[19:02] [singing]
[19:02] home.
[19:06] Almost. [singing]
[19:13] [music]
[19:16] I know that the cross [music] brought
[19:18] heaven to us. But make no mistake,
[19:22] there's still more to come. When our
[19:25] flesh and [music] our bone are no longer
[19:28] between. Where we are right now and
[19:31] where [music] we're meant to be. When
[19:34] all has been lost, been whole again.
[19:38] These tears [music] and this pain no
[19:41] longer exist. No more walking or we're
[19:44] running as fast as we can. Consider this
[19:49] our [music] second way.
[19:52] Almost
[19:54] home. Brother, [music] it won't be long.
[20:00] And all your burdens

[20:46] [music]
[20:50] home.

[21:15] hand. Amen. [applause]

[22:17] love me.
[22:23] Oh,

[22:34] Oh,
[22:37] how I love Jesus.
[22:43] [singing]
[22:45] Oh,
[22:48] how I love Jesus
[22:54] [music]
[22:55] because
[22:57] he first
[23:00] love me.
[23:06] Oh,
[23:09] how [music]
[23:10] I love
[23:14] the [music]
[23:17] Oh,
[23:19] how I [music and singing] love Jesus.
[23:27] Oh,
[23:30] how I love Jesus [music]
[23:37] [music and singing] because
[23:39] he first
[23:42] loved me. One more time. Now, let's just
[23:44] praise him. [music]
[23:48] Oh, [singing]
[23:50] how [music] I love Jesus.
[23:55] [music]
[23:58] Oh,
[24:01] how I [music and singing] love Jesus.
[24:08] Oh,
[24:11] how I love Jesus.
[24:18] Because [singing]
[24:20] he first
[24:23] loved me. [music]
[24:27] Amen. Amen.
[24:31] Hallelujah. Always happy to be in the
[24:32] house of the Lord tonight.
[24:34] Still just feasting on the word from
[24:36] this weekend. I think we all probably
[24:37] are. So thankful for the moving of the
[24:40] word and so much was said. I could
[24:42] probably just spend all night just going
[24:45] going through it. Um you know, one thing
[24:47] that was said that was some a sister was
[24:50] coming through the prayer line just
[24:52] standing in the gap for a loved one.
[24:53] Brother Andrew said, "This is the time
[24:56] for the prodals to come home."
[24:58] Amen.
[24:59] I believe that with all of my heart.
[25:01] Amen. I believe that the Lord is going
[25:03] to use the faith of his bride to bring
[25:06] them home. Amen.
[25:08] So, I'd like to take a thought on faith
[25:10] tonight. If we could open up in our
[25:12] Bibles Romans, the 10th chapter, Romans
[25:16] 10:17.
[25:17] We'll start there. We have three
[25:19] portions of reading. Just greet the
[25:22] visitors there. And God bless y'all.
[25:26] I took a thought along the same lines
[25:28] last week when I was ministering away,
[25:30] but the Lord kind of had me take a
[25:32] little different avenue with it tonight.
[25:34] No matter what our thoughts are, I just
[25:36] looking for the Lord to be the leader of
[25:38] the service to guide the ship tonight.
[25:40] Amen.
[25:41] Amen. I think um you know every time I
[25:45] go to minister, one of the very first
[25:46] things I pray that the Lord would go
[25:49] into each of your hearts that are going
[25:51] to be here tonight and would discern
[25:52] exactly what you have need of and then
[25:54] lay it on my heart. And it's funny
[25:56] because it seems like I never know
[25:58] exactly which way the Lord wants me to
[26:00] go until the day before. And you know,
[26:02] at first that's really nerve-wracking,
[26:05] but uh now that it's happened just about
[26:06] every time, I can have a little bit of a
[26:08] peace about it. So, amen. Let's go to
[26:10] the word. Romans 10:17.
[26:16] Amen. So, for then faith cometh by
[26:19] hearing and hearing by the word of God.
[26:23] We're going to go over into Hebrews 11.
[26:26] Hebrews 11. We're going to read the
[26:28] first six verses.
[26:32] Hebrews 11:1-6
[26:36] says, "Now faith is the substance of
[26:38] things hoped for, the evidence of things
[26:41] not seen. For by it the elders obtained
[26:44] a good report."
[26:47] Through faith, we understand that the
[26:49] worlds were framed by the word of God,
[26:52] so that things which are seen were not
[26:55] made of things which do appear. By faith
[26:58] Abel offered God unto God a more
[27:00] excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which
[27:02] he obtained witness that he was
[27:03] righteous, God testifying of his gifts,
[27:06] and by it he being dead yet speaketh. By
[27:08] faith Enoch was translated that he
[27:10] should not see death and was not found,
[27:12] because God had translated him. For
[27:14] before his translation he had the this
[27:17] testimony that he pleased God.
[27:20] But without faith, it is impossible to
[27:23] please him. For he that cometh to God
[27:25] must believe that he is and that he is a
[27:29] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[27:32] him.
[27:33] Amen. So, one more reading there in the
[27:36] book of Genesis all the way back.
[27:38] Genesis 32.
[27:42] Genesis 32 and we're going to look at
[27:44] six verses there. 32 22- 28. So, we'll
[27:48] start at verse 22.
[27:51] And he rose up that night. Now this is
[27:52] Jacob when he was on his way back to his
[27:54] land. He had, you know, he had that
[27:56] vision from the Lord that you need to go
[27:58] back to your land. So he rose up that
[28:00] night and he took his two wives and his
[28:02] woman servants and his 11 sons and
[28:04] passed over the for Jabbach and he took
[28:06] them and sent them over the brook and he
[28:08] sent over that he had. And Jacob was
[28:11] left alone and there wrestled a man with
[28:14] him until the breaking of the day. And
[28:16] when he saw that he prevailed not
[28:18] against him, he touched the hollow of of
[28:20] his thigh. And the hollow of the Jacob's
[28:23] thigh was out of joint as he wrestled
[28:25] with him. And he said, "Let me go, for
[28:27] the day breakth." And he said, "I will
[28:29] not let thee go except thou bless me."
[28:32] And he said unto him, "What is thy
[28:34] name?" And he said, "Jacob." And he
[28:35] said, "Thy name shall be called no more
[28:37] Jacob, but Israel. For as a prince hast
[28:41] thou power with God and with men, and
[28:44] hast prevailed." So, we see here Jacob
[28:47] fulfilling Hebrews 11:6. Rewarded for
[28:49] diligently seeking him. No matter what
[28:51] his past looked like, no matter what his
[28:53] failures he had, he didn't let any of
[28:55] those things hinder his faith that
[28:57] night. Oh my. Let's just go to the Lord.
[29:00] Heavenly Father, Lord, we just open up
[29:02] your word tonight. Father, we pray that
[29:04] you would have preeminence in the
[29:06] service tonight, Father. Lord, I pray
[29:07] that I can just move out of the way. I
[29:09] pray that, Lord, I can just find the
[29:11] mind of Christ. Lord, I pray that Lord,
[29:13] you would anoint the the speaker, anoint
[29:15] the hearers, Father, to hear your word
[29:17] tonight. Father, we're just all here in
[29:20] one mind, Lord, in one accord, just
[29:22] looking to draw a little bit closer to
[29:23] you. Father, we pray and ask over these
[29:26] things. We pray a blessing over the
[29:27] reading of your word. Lord, I pray that
[29:30] Lord, I wouldn't be confined to my
[29:31] notes. Lord, I pray that you would be
[29:33] the the leader of the service. Father,
[29:35] we ask all these things now in the
[29:36] mighty precious name of Jesus Christ.
[29:38] Amen. I pray the Lord add a blessing to
[29:40] the reading of his word. Take your
[29:41] seats. I'd like by the help of the Lord
[29:43] tonight to minister on faith by hearing.
[29:46] Faith, we know the prophet teaches us,
[29:49] is a six sense, something that rises
[29:51] above our natural ability to see or to
[29:54] feel or to hear something. But it's a
[29:56] belief in something. We know Hebrews
[29:59] 11:1 says that faith is the substance of
[30:01] things hoped for and the evidence of
[30:03] things not seen. So faith actually
[30:05] begins with a hope in something. But
[30:07] when you have faith, it's a step higher.
[30:09] And the word evidence by definition is
[30:12] something that furnishes proof. So faith
[30:15] grabs hold of hope and then makes it a
[30:18] reality. So you know we use the five
[30:21] senses and we're going to get a little
[30:22] deeper into that in a minute to hope for
[30:23] something but we can't stay there
[30:25] because faith is a revelation personally
[30:27] to you.
[30:28] Amen.
[30:28] And faith cometh by hearing and hearing
[30:31] of the word. So you beginning to hope in
[30:33] something you begin to speak it. Words
[30:35] are thought expressed. And when you get
[30:37] into the atmosphere of God, he begins to
[30:39] express his thoughts to you. Philippians
[30:42] 2 says, "Let this mind be in you that
[30:43] was in Christ Jesus." And then those
[30:45] thoughts of God are spoken through his
[30:49] body of believers and then expressed
[30:51] through their life. So the mind of
[30:53] Christ will become in you and then you
[30:55] express the mind of God through that.
[30:57] Amen. It's not the power of positive
[31:00] thinking. The prophet of God says it
[31:02] many times, the right mental attitude
[31:04] towards every promise of God will bring
[31:06] it to pass. So you take a mental
[31:08] conception of the need, healing in your
[31:10] body, salvation of a family member,
[31:12] healing of your mind, whatever it is,
[31:14] and then you continue in it. And because
[31:16] those promises to you are in the word of
[31:19] God, it will absolutely manifest and
[31:21] come to pass because God's word cannot
[31:23] fail.
[31:25] The prophet says that revelation is one
[31:27] of the most vital things that you need
[31:29] to pray for. Not just at one point in
[31:31] your life, but every single day.
[31:33] And faith, like I said, is a revelation
[31:34] to each one of us personally. Brother
[31:36] Benham says here at 1960, the
[31:38] unchangeable God, he says, I can go on
[31:39] record for this tonight. If any people
[31:41] will take the right mental attitude
[31:43] towards any divine promise that God ever
[31:46] made and claim it for yours, he will
[31:48] bring it to pass. If you'll take
[31:52] the right mental attitude towards it,
[31:54] knowing that if God says so, the promise
[31:56] is yours and it's your personal
[31:58] property. The very minute you receive it
[32:00] that way, then it has to come to pass.
[32:03] For Jesus said, "The word is a seed that
[32:06] a swer seed swed." And a seed, if it's
[32:08] germmitized seed, it goes into the
[32:10] ground and then the seed under the right
[32:12] conditions of the sun and the moisture
[32:14] will bring forth the life that's in that
[32:16] seed. So is the so is the word of God.
[32:19] He says, "If a person can take the word
[32:21] and place it in their heart and then
[32:23] give it the right amount of sunshine,
[32:25] the right temperature, not su n," he
[32:27] says, but s o n, the right temperature
[32:30] of faith in there, that seed and promise
[32:32] will live to you just as it did in the
[32:35] beginning to the one that it was given
[32:37] to because it's God's word and he's the
[32:39] same yesterday, to today, and forever.
[32:41] And he cannot fail. His word cannot
[32:44] fail. So, we find those promises in the
[32:47] scripture. We we read them and then we
[32:49] anchor it down in us and we live it. We
[32:54] just continue in it. Right.
[32:56] Amen.
[32:58] Just you just have to find the scripture
[33:00] that you need. Jehovah, Gyra, Abraham
[33:03] needed something to sacrifice. So he
[33:05] spoke the word to his two servants that
[33:07] God will provide for himself a sacrifice
[33:09] and then he just moved forward and then
[33:11] he manifested exactly what was needed.
[33:13] Amen. So here the prophet of God is
[33:15] saying that when you take the word and
[33:17] then you place it in the in your heart,
[33:19] you give it the right sunshine, the
[33:21] right temperature, it comes alive to you
[33:23] personally because why? Because God's
[33:25] word can't fail. And the more that you
[33:27] dive into the word, the more you ask for
[33:29] revelation, the more God's going to
[33:31] reveal to you in your heart and in your
[33:32] life that that promise is actually yours
[33:35] and you are a possessor of that promise.
[33:37] Amen.
[33:37] Amen. There is a two-fold purpose of
[33:40] getting in the right temperature. It
[33:41] brings forth the life of the seed in you
[33:44] and it bakes out all that stuff that it
[33:47] that doesn't need to be there.
[33:48] So we increase our faith by laying in
[33:51] the presence of the sun. Brother Random
[33:53] says that so many times in his last year
[33:54] of ministry by the year of the by by the
[33:57] hearing of the word. It adds the right
[33:59] amount of light on the seed in you and
[34:02] it begins to literally furnish proof of
[34:04] whatever desire you have in your heart
[34:06] as long as it lines up with the word.
[34:08] Amen.
[34:09] And even greater than that, your desires
[34:12] begin to match his desires.
[34:14] Because when you get in into that
[34:16] presence and stay there, you are abiding
[34:18] him. Scripture says that he abides in
[34:20] you. So at whatever stage, whatever
[34:23] stage of walk that you're in tonight,
[34:25] you pray for the revelation of your
[34:27] life. And then that second fold of that,
[34:30] you you manifest that by hearing the
[34:32] word of God. That begins to bake out
[34:34] that old life. And that begins to settle
[34:36] something that revelation because that
[34:38] seed that's placed in you, that
[34:40] germmitized seed that God placed in you
[34:41] from the before the foundation of the
[34:43] world, it begins to grow. And that right
[34:45] amount of light is going to grow. And
[34:46] then all the weeds that are around that
[34:48] thing that God knows that each one of us
[34:50] have, that thing be those things just
[34:52] begin to fall away because you're in the
[34:54] right amount of temperature. Not too
[34:56] much, not too little, just the right
[34:58] amount of temperature. Amen. Faith is a
[34:59] revelation. Brother Brandham says here
[35:01] in Revelation 4, he says, "Now the
[35:03] senses in the body, is that right?" He
[35:06] knows that. How many knows that six
[35:07] senses control the body? We got a soul
[35:10] after you get through this. The senses
[35:12] is outside and that's the outer system.
[35:14] See,
[35:16] see, taste, feel, smell here. And now in
[35:18] here, there's two, three, four, five
[35:20] attributes in the soul. Now, you want to
[35:22] write them down. The first one is
[35:23] imagination. The second is conscious.
[35:25] The third is memory, he says. The fourth
[35:26] is reason. The fifth is affection. Now,
[35:29] did you get them all? He says if you
[35:30] don't then let me let me know. You got
[35:32] them all down. See, taste, feel, smell,
[35:33] hear the body. That's that's the open to
[35:36] the body. So the soul is imagination,
[35:40] conscience, memory, reason, affection is
[35:42] the senses or the attributes like the
[35:45] senses of the soul. And the soul,
[35:48] catch this, the soul is the nature of
[35:50] the spirit that's on the inside. Cuz the
[35:53] does because the soul only puts out an
[35:55] atmosphere of what's on the inside of
[35:57] you. It takes the place of
[35:59] sanctification. The soul sets the same
[36:02] category all right there. Everybody get
[36:04] that down. Now to this gate, there's
[36:06] only one gate. That's called self-will.
[36:09] You're the boss of what goes in there.
[36:12] And what does it do? What is this? The
[36:14] body must be washed, the lav sanctified
[36:17] here, filled with the Holy Spirit. And
[36:19] this becomes God's judgment seat again
[36:21] where God sits in your heart and if you
[36:23] do something wrong, you say, "Oh my, I
[36:25] did something wrong."
[36:26] See, so when your nature is changed and
[36:29] you're filled with the spirit of God,
[36:30] you can still do wrong. That's in our
[36:33] nature. That's just the flesh outer man
[36:35] that we take. But the difference is that
[36:37] you get so convicted of it that you're
[36:39] you have that sanctification living on
[36:41] the inside of you. So then you say, "Oh
[36:43] God, I did something wrong. Lord,
[36:45] forgive me of it." And that's the first
[36:46] thing that you have in your heart.
[36:47] Nothing else matters until you make that
[36:49] thing right with God because your nature
[36:51] is literally changed.
[36:54] It is a strange thing. Brother Random
[36:55] says looking at the unseen 1958 says it
[36:58] is a strange thing that man who was made
[37:00] in the image and the likeness of God and
[37:02] was called of him to walk by faith
[37:05] believing that God is would choose to
[37:07] walk by sight instead of by faith after
[37:09] his makeup his being. All that dwells in
[37:11] him was fashioned in the likeness of
[37:12] God. And God is that great Jehovah who
[37:15] calls those things which were not as
[37:17] though they were. And man made to live
[37:19] with God in this manner. Yet has he
[37:21] chosen to walk by his sight. He says he
[37:24] wants to be our own. He wants to be his
[37:26] own boss. That's just in our nature. He
[37:28] wants no one to tell him what to do.
[37:30] That's just the nature of man. It proved
[37:32] to be thus in the garden of Eden when he
[37:34] lost his fellowship with God by choosing
[37:36] to go his own way, not having rule over
[37:39] him. But a man is made like a sheep and
[37:41] a sheep cannot find his way. It he says,
[37:43] I'm told. When it's lost, it's totally
[37:45] lost. And that's the way with man. When
[37:47] he's lost, he's absolutely helpless. He
[37:49] must have a shepherd to guide him. And
[37:52] man, when he chooses, as the day goes
[37:54] on, we find man continually getting
[37:56] worse, choosing rather to walk by sight
[37:59] than instead of by faith, by the unseen.
[38:01] And when he does that, listen, he when
[38:03] he does that, he robs the inner man,
[38:06] which is the soul. And that's the
[38:08] eternal part of man. Each one of us has
[38:10] an eternal part. So, you're robbing that
[38:12] eternal part.
[38:15] He says, 'Now man shall not live by
[38:16] bread alone, said the Lord, but by every
[38:18] word that proceeded out out of the ma
[38:20] mouth of God. So that part of you that's
[38:23] calling out that you did something
[38:24] wrong, that's calling out that you want
[38:26] to live a more holy life, that that
[38:28] eternal part calling out saying come
[38:30] home, that your inner man, our biggest
[38:32] enemy, I hate giving credit to the
[38:34] devil. I sure hate it. I don't like to
[38:35] give him credit for anything. Our
[38:37] biggest enemy is not the devil. It is
[38:39] not the devil at all. It is ourselves. I
[38:42] I just hate giving him the credit. It's
[38:44] your flesh man that gets in the way so
[38:46] much of the time. It's the inner man
[38:48] that's always waring with your carnal
[38:50] nature. Paul teaches us about that. He
[38:53] says that I do the things that I
[38:55] desperately don't want to do and I don't
[38:57] do the things that my very inner man
[38:59] wants to do. And I just said, man, when
[39:01] he when I read that, I'm just like that
[39:02] is me living there right there. I I I
[39:04] don't do the things that I desperately
[39:06] my inner man desperately wants to do.
[39:08] But then those things that I don't want
[39:10] to do that my but my outer man somehow
[39:12] gets control of it. Those are the things
[39:13] that I end up doing. And why is that?
[39:15] It's because that nature is living. It's
[39:18] still living right right beside you
[39:20] trying to have control of you.
[39:22] What happens? It's your fallen nature.
[39:24] It's fighting with you even after you're
[39:26] born again of the spirit of God.
[39:28] Amen.
[39:29] We literally rob ourselves when we start
[39:32] walking by sight.
[39:34] Wow.
[39:36] We we walk out of the plan of God and
[39:38] then we find ourselves on the basis of
[39:40] reasoning.
[39:41] What happens in our minds when we hear
[39:43] the word of God spoken? Maybe it's in
[39:45] correction. Then we don't stay with it.
[39:48] We do exactly what Abraham did there
[39:50] with AMC. We start walking by sight. We
[39:53] inject our own plan into God's plan
[39:55] because why? Because of that fallen
[39:57] nature. He told Sarah to lie and say
[39:59] that she was his sister. And then when
[40:01] she would then when he's confronted with
[40:02] it, he tries to justify his actions and
[40:04] say, 'Well, you know, she really is my
[40:06] sister, but she's just my halfsister
[40:08] that I'm that I'm married to. Don't we
[40:09] always try to justify our actions and
[40:11] try to find a way around whatever we did
[40:13] wrong?
[40:14] Absolutely.
[40:15] You know, we heard the word preached at
[40:16] the revival the revival meetings this
[40:18] weekend and something deep laid down
[40:20] deep within us is screaming amen to
[40:22] every word. Right. Glory to God. That's
[40:24] nothing but the truth. But then we leave
[40:26] Monday and then we have the pressures of
[40:28] life and then we we're not under that
[40:29] inspiration anymore. Then we leave and
[40:31] and and the conviction that you had your
[40:33] on your heart somehow, you know, we
[40:35] start to reason it away. And what is it?
[40:37] It's not it's not that inner man
[40:38] reasoning it away. It's that outer man,
[40:40] that outer flesh, it's that enemy that's
[40:41] trying to reason that thing away from
[40:43] you. Whatever conviction that you had,
[40:45] whatever thing that you had laid on your
[40:47] heart, it's trying to reason it all
[40:48] away. Whatever victory you had, it's
[40:50] trying to reason it away. But you stand
[40:52] on that promise of God. whatever you
[40:54] had, whatever experience, and you stay
[40:56] right with it, just like Jacob stayed
[40:58] with it. He wrestled with it until he
[41:00] possessed it.
[41:01] Hallelujah.
[41:02] Glory to God. What happens? The sun, the
[41:05] sen was baking that besetting sin out of
[41:08] your life. You were in the right amount
[41:10] of temperature and it was it was
[41:11] watering that seed in you.
[41:17] You know, we start to we start to
[41:18] justify like we were saying, it's not
[41:20] necessarily maybe a sinful thing that
[41:22] I'm doing. You know, there isn't any
[41:24] scripture that perfectly states that
[41:25] there. Maybe there's not a direct quote
[41:27] against it. Yet, you had that conviction
[41:29] laid in your heart. And what was it?
[41:31] That was the Holy Ghost trying to bake
[41:33] that thing out of you. He was reminding
[41:35] you of your position. If he places
[41:38] conviction on you for something, and it
[41:40] may not even seem like anything, he
[41:42] knows what he's doing. He knows your ins
[41:44] and he knows your outs. He knows your
[41:46] ups and he knows your downs. He knows
[41:48] all about you. So, he has something. He
[41:50] has he has he has an eagle-eyed view to
[41:52] know that whatever it was maybe isn't
[41:54] affecting you now, but later down the
[41:56] road it may be affecting you. Maybe it
[41:58] won't ever affect you, but maybe
[41:59] somebody's watching your life and it'll
[42:01] affect them. So, we have to be because
[42:03] we we're written epistles read of all
[42:05] men. So, we have to be sanctified. We
[42:07] have to be cleansed always washed by the
[42:10] water of the word. Amen.
[42:12] And you know, when the Holy Spirit does
[42:14] convict you, you know it's because Jesus
[42:17] loves us more than anything. Right?
[42:19] You know, when we we correct our kids,
[42:21] you know, it's to teach them. You know,
[42:23] my one-year-old, she doesn't know better
[42:25] than to run into the street. So, it's my
[42:27] responsibility to train her not to do
[42:29] that kind of a thing, to correct her,
[42:31] because why? Because if I don't correct
[42:33] her when there's no cars in the street
[42:34] and I'm not around one day or or you
[42:36] know, some something happens and she
[42:38] doesn't know to run, you know, we can't
[42:40] really teach her that yet because she's
[42:41] only one, but you know, when she does to
[42:43] get to that point, she'll run out in
[42:45] there and she could die. God sees every
[42:48] part of our life. He sees exactly what's
[42:50] going to happen at every single turn. So
[42:52] he knows that maybe you know 5 years
[42:54] down the road that little besetting
[42:56] weight or that little seed that you're
[42:58] that you're not going to squash in your
[43:00] life it becomes a it becomes a tree and
[43:02] then that tree grows fruit and then that
[43:05] fruit falls off that tree and then
[43:07] there's more seeds and then there's more
[43:09] seeds and before you know it you don't
[43:10] even realize that now you're in this
[43:12] entire forest of this besetting sin that
[43:14] was just a seed at one time in your
[43:16] life.
[43:20] The Lord is calling us higher than that,
[43:22] saints.
[43:23] He has a vision of you as a finished
[43:25] product. When he when he came there in
[43:27] Hebrews in the 11th chapter, it says
[43:30] Abraham staggered not at the promise of
[43:32] God because he had a vision of the
[43:34] finished product of him. He sees the
[43:37] finished product of you. It doesn't
[43:39] matter what you what what what your past
[43:41] looks like. It doesn't matter what sin
[43:42] it was in your life. It doesn't matter.
[43:44] God sees the finished product of you.
[43:47] You come there and Joseph and his
[43:48] brothers and you you look at this story
[43:50] and you think, man, you know, Judah, the
[43:53] line of the tribe of Judah is what the
[43:54] lineage of Jesus came from. You know,
[43:56] Judah in the Bible was the one who who
[43:58] had the idea, let's betray, let's bet
[44:01] let's let's let's send him off into into
[44:03] slavery. You have all these brothers and
[44:05] then years down the road they get in
[44:07] this place in their lives and and they
[44:08] thought that their sin had caught up
[44:10] with them and and their sin they thought
[44:13] it was going to find them and Joseph me
[44:15] and me and my wife were just reading it
[44:16] the other night and Joseph comes there
[44:18] they don't they don't know it's Joseph
[44:20] yet and they're speaking in their tongue
[44:22] and he has an interpreter so he doesn't
[44:24] they don't know that he knows what
[44:26] they're talking about and he said
[44:27] remember when we sold our brother this
[44:29] is the sin this is what's going to take
[44:30] place and and but what What happened was
[44:34] is Joseph at that time was going to
[44:37] extend a hand of grace in there. God is
[44:40] always willing to extend a hand of
[44:42] grace. Joseph is a perfect type of
[44:44] Christ. Always willing to extend a hand
[44:46] of grace while we're still here before
[44:48] the rapture comes. There is a there is a
[44:50] hand of grace in your life that he's
[44:52] extending. He's extending that olive
[44:54] branch TO SAY COME BACK. you know, you
[44:56] may be, you know, uh, 10 steps in the
[44:58] wrong direction, but just take one
[45:00] little step back in the right direction
[45:02] and we're going to you're going to find
[45:03] your way back home. And then you get you
[45:05] get later on in that scripture and that
[45:07] story and you look at, you know, what do
[45:10] you think that they went through all
[45:11] those years of that besetting sin and
[45:13] then when it caught up to them and they
[45:15] realized, my goodness, you know, we sold
[45:17] our brother and and they thought he had
[45:18] died and now they come to this point
[45:20] where it was time to go and tell their
[45:22] father what had happened. And they get
[45:25] to this point and they realize there
[45:27] there isn't even I couldn't find any
[45:29] scriptures where where they were scared
[45:31] to tell their dad the what had taken
[45:33] place. They they were scared to say that
[45:35] we that we that we sold our brother into
[45:37] Egypt. All they were so excited that
[45:40] their younger brother wasn't going to
[45:41] die. They said Joseph is alive and and
[45:43] there was just there was such a
[45:44] miraculous time. to whatever happened in
[45:47] your life, whatever happened in your
[45:48] past, even a besetting thing that you
[45:50] maybe feel ashamed of or whatever the
[45:51] case is. God doesn't care about the past
[45:54] cuz somehow he always takes broken
[45:56] things and he makes them beautiful. He
[45:58] always can take the crooked path he says
[46:01] there and then he makes it straight
[46:02] somehow. God I hate to like I said
[46:05] earlier I hate giving the devil credit
[46:06] for everything though God has a plan. So
[46:09] before the foundation of the world and
[46:10] this is not to dis discredit sin in our
[46:13] lives but before the foundation of the
[46:15] world he knew each mistake he was going
[46:16] to each mistake that we were going to
[46:18] make. So then he crafted a plan that
[46:21] this was going to come out of this
[46:22] mistake somehow someway you he was going
[46:25] to take that mistake and he was going to
[46:27] make something beautiful out of it. I
[46:29] DON'T KNOW HOW GOD IS the orchestrator
[46:31] of it all. But all he needs, all he
[46:34] needs is a surrendered HEART TO SAY, "OH
[46:36] GOD, LORD, I'm Lord, forgive me of
[46:39] whatever it is that I did. Lord, get me
[46:41] on that that straight path. Take away
[46:43] all that crooked things in my life and
[46:45] just get me on that straight path." Then
[46:47] he takes care of the rest. Oh, he makes
[46:49] the the the the He makes the the gate
[46:52] beautiful again.
[46:53] Glory to God. I I I did a men's
[46:56] breakfast a few months ago and the
[46:58] thought that the Lord had placed on my
[46:59] heart was in the bosom of God.
[47:02] You know, I took that thought there from
[47:04] John 13 where John was laying there
[47:06] right on the bosom of Jesus right after
[47:08] Jesus prophesies of his betrayal and he
[47:11] starts he starts asking him the question
[47:13] Lord
[47:14] he says Jesus is it I is it I Lord is it
[47:17] I that's that's betraying you
[47:21] my it should always be at the forefront
[47:23] of our hearts to ask that kind of a
[47:25] question to the Lord is there something
[47:27] in me that's betraying the confidence
[47:30] that you have Lord God is there
[47:32] something. Is there some maybe besetting
[47:34] thing that maybe maybe it doesn't look
[47:37] like it's that big of a deal? Or maybe
[47:39] we reasoned it away. Maybe, you know,
[47:41] you know, maybe we we started comparing
[47:43] ourselves to the world and maybe it
[47:45] didn't look like it was so bad because,
[47:47] you know, we're way much better way
[47:49] better off looking, you know, than than
[47:51] the world at this point. But we don't
[47:53] compare ourselves to the world, saints
[47:54] of God. We compare ourselves to the word
[47:56] of God. We compare ourselves to what God
[47:59] has ordained for us in our life. Amen.
[48:04] Like the prophet said there in in uh
[48:06] that first quote I read, paragraph 20
[48:08] 2:22 in Revelation chapter chapter 4,
[48:12] my is it is is it something laid in me
[48:15] that betrays your word? Is there some
[48:17] hindrance that's keeping me from moving
[48:19] forward in you? You know, I believe that
[48:21] really truly is everyone's heart's
[48:23] desires tonight. Just draw closer to the
[48:25] Lord and to be more like him in every
[48:27] way. To change our hearts, to change our
[48:29] desires, right? You know, but often time
[48:32] the biggest and I was saying this, the
[48:33] biggest and the most exponential thing
[48:35] that you can do for the Lord is actually
[48:37] remove all the hindrances in your own
[48:39] life. You know, you maybe you want to
[48:41] you you want to speak to that mountain,
[48:43] but maybe you have a speck in your life
[48:44] that God needs to get rid of first
[48:46] before you can speak to that mountain.
[48:48] God has God has things orchestrated
[48:50] perfectly to make you perfect. He He has
[48:54] made herself ready. And brother Brandon,
[48:56] we're going to get to this quote later,
[48:57] but Brother Brandon will say that she
[48:58] has the materials here on earth to make
[49:01] herself ready. What is those materials?
[49:03] It's the word. It's the message of the
[49:05] hour to us today to wash us by a clean
[49:08] word, not some kind of formal go to
[49:11] church and we'll just say we went to
[49:12] church and you know that's it. It's it's
[49:15] living by every word that God had has
[49:17] told us to live by.
[49:18] Yes, sir.
[49:19] That's right.
[49:21] Brother Random says here in the contest
[49:22] 1962, now the enemy is going to study
[49:24] our strategy with the word. Satan
[49:26] studied all that out so perfectly till
[49:28] when he came to Eve, the best strategy
[49:31] that he could use with her was that to
[49:33] reason with the word. Now, you never
[49:35] want to reason with God's word.
[49:36] Amen.
[49:37] You just believe it. Don't try to
[49:39] explain it. Don't try to figure it out.
[49:41] You cannot figure out God. God is the
[49:43] word and it's just made to believe.
[49:45] That's our strength is just accept the
[49:48] word. And anyone knows that a seed in
[49:50] the right kind of ground will produce
[49:53] its kind. So we take the word and then
[49:55] we produce the word.
[49:57] Amen.
[49:58] Satan's cunning. He's deceptive. And he
[50:00] studies our strategy with the word just
[50:02] like he did did Eve. And that's why we
[50:04] don't take we don't take anything from
[50:06] the word. We don't add anything. We
[50:07] don't subtract anything. We just we do
[50:09] exactly what he said to do. We say
[50:11] exactly what he said to say. Amen. the,
[50:13] you know, the enemy, he's always trying
[50:15] to attempt, he's always attempting to
[50:16] destroy the word of God in your life.
[50:20] He's always trying to belittle your
[50:21] experience. He's trying to explain away
[50:23] your healing. Maybe you had a victory
[50:25] this weekend in those revival services.
[50:27] Maybe something happened, but he's
[50:28] trying to take that away from you. You
[50:30] keep that victory. You take it because
[50:32] it really is your victory. Amen. He'll
[50:36] reason it away somehow. But our job
[50:38] isn't to figure out something. It's not
[50:40] to It's not to carve out some kind of
[50:41] our own plan like Abraham did. It's just
[50:44] to take him at his word and just to
[50:45] strive forward with it.
[50:47] Amen.
[50:49] The Lord might place conviction, but
[50:51] then we reason it away. Paul says there,
[50:54] we have a scripture for that. Paul says
[50:55] there, "All things are lawful for me,
[50:57] but all things are not expedient." So
[51:00] whatever it is maybe he placed on your
[51:02] heart, it's actually him answering your
[51:04] prayer. Because when we we pray the
[51:06] Lord, Lord, I want to draw closer to
[51:08] you. his answer back. Well, maybe that
[51:10] thing in your life isn't it's not
[51:12] technically unlawful, but it's really
[51:14] it's not expedient to your walk. It's
[51:16] it's it's kind of going to become a
[51:18] besetting thing. You know, it's it's
[51:20] really it's hindering your walk with me.
[51:22] And so, I kind of want you to get rid of
[51:24] it. And the Lord is a gentleman, so he's
[51:26] just going to place it. And then we have
[51:28] to with our own self-will, we have to
[51:31] accept that and we have to move forward
[51:32] into it. Amen.
[51:36] Oh, and just John just laying there on
[51:38] the bosoms asking, "Is it I, Lord? Is
[51:41] there anything laid in me? All those
[51:43] disciples, is there anything in me?"
[51:44] Look at the approach. Just such
[51:46] reverence, such respect. You know, they
[51:48] weren't sure who was going to be the one
[51:51] that said, you know, was going to be
[51:52] betrayed them. But their hearts went out
[51:54] for him. Amen.
[51:55] They had such a care and such a love for
[51:57] him. They didn't they didn't want it to
[51:59] be them. Their hearts, their desires was
[52:01] with God. Is that your desire tonight?
[52:03] Is your heart is your desire to say, "Is
[52:05] there something in me that betrays you,
[52:07] Lord? Is there something in me that
[52:09] shouldn't be there? Is there something
[52:10] in me that trespasses your confidence?
[52:13] I'll make it right, Lord, whatever it
[52:15] takes because I value your word. I value
[52:19] everything that you had to say."
[52:22] Often times, I think we can even
[52:24] trespass his confidence without even
[52:26] fully realizing it.
[52:29] If we can begin in the state of humility
[52:31] and actually seek after correction until
[52:34] there's nothing left to correct, Lord,
[52:37] is there something in me that grieves
[52:38] your Holy Spirit, anything unholy?
[52:40] Ephesians 4 says, "Grieve not the Holy
[52:42] Spirit by which we're sealed by until
[52:43] the day of redemption." And that's the
[52:45] attitude we can keep and the approach we
[52:47] can take. That's where he wants to take
[52:48] us. Such a place of confidence in his
[52:52] word. Amen.
[52:53] Brother Brandham says there in perfect
[52:55] faith, he says, "When we were sinners,
[52:56] alienated without God in the world in
[52:59] that muck of mud, as I talked about this
[53:01] morning, God came to us. God sought you,
[53:05] you never sought God. No man can come to
[53:08] me except the father draws him first.
[53:10] And God came down to me in that muck,
[53:13] what you were, and sought you, and then
[53:15] he brought you out of it." That ought to
[53:17] create a perfect love. He says, "Look
[53:19] what you was, now look what you are."
[53:21] Hallelujah. What did that something that
[53:24] loves you? Somebody that loves you.
[53:26] Can't you have faith in what he promised
[53:28] you? Then a real genuine love will
[53:32] create a confidence in his word.
[53:35] Hallelujah. He caught me when I was
[53:36] nothing and I'm still nothing. He says,
[53:39] "But now I'm in his hand." Hallelujah.
[53:41] He caught me. He loved me when I was
[53:43] unlovable. He loved you when you was
[53:44] unlovable. But he changed you. Just like
[53:47] that colored sister said that time in
[53:49] her testimony, she said, "I'm not what I
[53:50] ought to be. I'm not what I want to be.
[53:51] But man, I'm sure not what I used to be.
[53:54] Man, I'm so glad for that. He says, "If
[53:55] God, when I was an alien, loved me so
[53:58] much till he stooped down to get me and
[54:00] pick me up. That gives me confidence."
[54:02] Now, listen here. That gives me
[54:04] confidence that he wants to use me. That
[54:06] gives me confidence that he wants to use
[54:08] each one of us here tonight. He's got a
[54:10] purpose in doing it. He's seen something
[54:12] in you. He's seen something in you. He
[54:15] says he had a reason to save you. Look
[54:18] at the people that's unsaved today. Look
[54:19] at the millions he could have took
[54:21] beside you, but he took you.
[54:23] He took you. Amen. And no one can take
[54:27] your place. It says, it says you are in
[54:29] God's, he says, you're in God's economy.
[54:32] No one can do it. That's his love to
[54:35] you. You are in God's economy. What a
[54:38] promise of the word. No matter what the
[54:41] situation or, you know, the
[54:42] circumstance, he says it's governed by
[54:45] the love that creates faith. So that
[54:48] love of God's word creates faith because
[54:51] faith cometh by hearing and when you
[54:53] hear the word of God then he can bake
[54:55] out those things and then bring that
[54:57] seed to life. Amen.
[54:59] Amen.
[55:00] Amen.
[55:02] That quote is just so encouraging for
[55:04] me. I He's He's seen something in you.
[55:08] Yes, sir.
[55:11] And you know when we realize that he's
[55:14] seen something in you to overcome in the
[55:16] last days, he's seen something that you
[55:19] are going to overcome by the blood of
[55:21] the lamb and by the word of your
[55:22] testimony. And when we realize that, it
[55:25] should give us such a determination to
[55:27] get so hidden in Christ Jesus.
[55:30] Not to say it or not to just, you know,
[55:32] preach it, but to really live it. Amen.
[55:35] means coming to a place in our lives in
[55:37] Jesus where Jesus he's really is truly
[55:39] first and foremost in every avenue. A
[55:42] place where we have such confidence in
[55:45] his word that his commandments and
[55:47] following everything he said do means
[55:49] more to you than anything. A place where
[55:51] this message, the message of the hour
[55:53] means more to you than anything because
[55:56] it's a word through a prophet given
[55:58] given to us to perfect us. Because God
[56:01] in his infinite wisdom and mercy gave us
[56:03] a word to take us home. And then he
[56:05] placed you here in this day because he
[56:08] had confidence that you were going to
[56:09] overcome by the word by the blood of the
[56:11] lamb and by the word of your testimony.
[56:14] Amen.
[56:14] Glory to God in his infinite wisdom. I
[56:17] heard a brother say Tim brother Tim Doy
[56:20] said this at at a at the men's meeting a
[56:22] couple years ago. He says you know we
[56:23] try to quantify God. You know we Abraham
[56:26] sat there you know in 25 years you know
[56:28] and and if and this clock he used if you
[56:31] look at a clock on a year a thousand
[56:34] years is like a year for the Lord or is
[56:37] like a day for the Lord I think. So he
[56:39] says if you look at a clock that really
[56:41] only took God six minutes to do that
[56:43] thing in Abraham's life. We try to
[56:45] quantify the things in our life because
[56:48] all we are we're we're simple. We're
[56:49] human beings and we have our trials we
[56:52] face our tests. We have these things
[56:53] that we go through and we try to
[56:55] quantify things. But God is an infinite
[56:57] God. He doesn't have quantity like we
[57:00] do. He has everything. He knows
[57:02] everything. He is everything. So if we
[57:04] place our faith in that and have a
[57:07] substance of that, it will furnish the
[57:09] proof in your life. And it will come by
[57:12] hearing hearing of the word accepting
[57:14] that word in your life and then moving
[57:16] forward in that word.
[57:18] Amen. Wow.
[57:20] You you hear quotes. You you hear the
[57:22] word being preached like this weekend
[57:24] and you know it's the opposite of what
[57:26] the world would say. It's it's not
[57:29] popular what was preached this weekend.
[57:31] But something deep down in me just says
[57:33] amen. It just makes me want to shout.
[57:35] Something deep down just says
[57:36] hallelujah. What is that? That's the
[57:38] right temperature getting on that seed
[57:40] in your life saying amen to every word
[57:43] of God. Hallelujah.
[57:45] Glory.
[57:47] Hallelujah.
[57:49] What a what a humble heart it has to
[57:51] take to ask that question, Lord, is it
[57:54] I? And then really mean it, you know,
[57:56] because he's always faithful and he's
[57:58] always going to do what what he says
[58:00] he's going to do. And just to answer
[58:02] your prayer, you know, my son, my yes,
[58:04] my son, yes, my daughter, here it is.
[58:06] You know, you're living this way. You're
[58:08] doing this thing. Yet, I've called you
[58:10] to higher places than that, to deeper
[58:13] depths. Now, listen, we all mess up.
[58:16] None of us here tonight or across the
[58:17] internet ways are are immune from
[58:20] mistakes. We all make mistakes even
[58:22] after we're born again of the spirit of
[58:23] God. All he wants us to become is more
[58:26] humble and have confidence in his word.
[58:29] And then he can take the testimony of
[58:31] whatever he brought you from and he can
[58:33] shake the gates of hell with it.
[58:36] Glory to God.
[58:37] He can add the right amount of water
[58:39] from the word and cause it cause that
[58:42] seed to grow just a little bit more.
[58:45] speaking on faith tonight. See, he's got
[58:47] confidence in us.
[58:49] Amen.
[58:51] Whatever it is, how hard it may be, how
[58:53] ridiculous it sounds, he wants us to
[58:56] have such confidence in him that he
[58:59] knows best.
[59:01] You know, and that's living a truly
[59:02] surrendered life in Christ. And you
[59:05] know, when a preacher says that to live
[59:07] a surrendered life, it's not a cliche
[59:09] term. It's not a far-reaching
[59:11] impossibility. It's as simple as putting
[59:14] yourself in the presence of the sen and
[59:17] then obeying every part of the word of
[59:19] God and then moving forward. That's as
[59:21] simple as a full surrender is. You you
[59:24] say amen to the word and then you apply
[59:26] it to your life and then faith by
[59:28] hearing will then grow that seed. It'll
[59:30] bake away all those things that don't
[59:32] need to be there and then you'll grow
[59:33] into your perfection one day. That's all
[59:35] it takes. Hallelujah.
[59:38] Very good.
[59:42] It's [clears throat] It's going to
[59:43] happen when you fall. But I just want to
[59:45] encourage you tonight. Don't stay down.
[59:48] Stand up and keep on walking. Subject
[59:51] your mind to feed on the things of the
[59:53] word. Feed those senses with the right
[59:56] thing.
[59:57] Yes.
[59:58] Because faith cometh by hearing and
[1:00:00] hearing the word of God. You stay right
[1:00:02] with that. That presence when you pray
[1:00:05] or when you praise or when you get into
[1:00:07] that atmosphere. Brother Benham says it
[1:00:10] says it brings you into a different
[1:00:12] atmosphere. It brings all your flaws to
[1:00:14] the surface. It brings you to
[1:00:16] repentance. And then when you are empty
[1:00:18] or you make the choice with your free
[1:00:20] will to break away from that or break
[1:00:22] away from a besetting sin in your life,
[1:00:25] then he can put more light on that seed
[1:00:27] because maybe there's just there's 75%
[1:00:30] that he can get, but there's still a
[1:00:31] little bit that he needs. He needs to
[1:00:32] get full light on that seed. He wants
[1:00:34] all of it gone.
[1:00:36] He wants to break us from our own will.
[1:00:40] Prophet God said there at the quote in
[1:00:41] the beginning, there's only one gate and
[1:00:43] that's called self-will because he gave
[1:00:45] us free moral agency to choose. We have
[1:00:47] to subject ourselves
[1:00:50] to that actual surrender.
[1:00:53] So he can have first place. His will is
[1:00:55] always first and foremost. Amen.
[1:00:57] Amen.
[1:00:58] He knows best. I love this quote in
[1:01:00] perseverance. Brother Bham says, "You've
[1:01:01] had things to happen. You just knew it
[1:01:03] was going to be. You didn't know what it
[1:01:04] was going to be, but it was going to be.
[1:01:06] That's faith. That's real faith. It's
[1:01:08] going to happen. Then when you when you
[1:01:10] know that it's going to be. Now, faith
[1:01:12] finds a source that others don't see.
[1:01:15] Amen.
[1:01:15] Wow. His word is a sword. The Bible said
[1:01:18] so in Hebrews 4:12 that it is a sword.
[1:01:21] And it takes an arm of faith to yield to
[1:01:25] wield that sword. Only faith can do it
[1:01:29] to hold that sword.
[1:01:30] Amen. Now, brother Brandham here, he's
[1:01:32] about to make a reference into that
[1:01:34] story in there in Matthew uh referring
[1:01:36] to the woman who had the demon-possessed
[1:01:37] child. Well, she was a gentile. She came
[1:01:39] to Jesus and um Matthew um she came out
[1:01:43] and she worshiped him crying and said,
[1:01:44] "Lord, help me." But he said, "It is not
[1:01:46] meat to take the children's bread and to
[1:01:48] cast it to dogs." She said, "Truth,
[1:01:50] Lord, yet the dogs eat the crumbs that
[1:01:52] fall from their master's table." Then
[1:01:54] Jesus answered, said unto her, "Oh
[1:01:55] woman, great is thy faith. Be it unto
[1:01:57] thee, even as thou wilt." and her
[1:01:59] daughter was made whole from that hour.
[1:02:01] That was a scripture. And the prophet
[1:02:04] says she had many hindrances. This
[1:02:07] little woman, she had a daughter that
[1:02:08] was having epilepsy. She was very, very
[1:02:11] bad. She had heard that Jesus healed
[1:02:14] epilepsy. And he says, "Now faith cometh
[1:02:17] by hearing, and that was her child. So
[1:02:19] she was determined to get down somewhere
[1:02:21] and to hear Jesus." Now, she had many
[1:02:24] hindrances, just many hindrances. But
[1:02:26] her faith didn't have no hindrances.
[1:02:28] Tonight people has a lot of hindrances.
[1:02:30] He says your mind has a lot of
[1:02:32] hindrances but your faith there is
[1:02:34] nothing that can stand in its way
[1:02:37] because faith knows no hindrances.
[1:02:40] Amen.
[1:02:41] And this woman heard that there was
[1:02:43] something that could be done for her
[1:02:45] sick daughter demonpossessed. The
[1:02:47] scripture says she wasn't going to let
[1:02:48] that little discouragement get in her
[1:02:50] way. She had the right mental attitude
[1:02:52] towards the word. She accepted what he
[1:02:55] said. She humbled herself in his
[1:02:57] presence. And then her faith was not
[1:02:59] stopped. She had a determination to stay
[1:03:01] with it because there was a life on the
[1:03:04] line. There are lives on the line in
[1:03:07] your life. There are lives on the line
[1:03:10] in your life that are counting on you to
[1:03:13] stick with the word.
[1:03:16] Think about that, friends. There are
[1:03:17] there are people in your life that are
[1:03:20] counting on you to stick with the word
[1:03:22] because your faith is going to be what
[1:03:24] brings them into their change. Your
[1:03:27] faith because God works through his
[1:03:29] body. So he places that faith within us.
[1:03:32] So then that takes all of the credit
[1:03:33] away from us. But he uses his body here
[1:03:36] on earth to manifest things. So your
[1:03:39] testimony of what you do, where you go,
[1:03:41] how you act is going to prove to other
[1:03:44] people that this can be done here in the
[1:03:47] last age. This can be done. So you stay
[1:03:50] right with that word and you just keep
[1:03:52] moving forward. No how no matter how
[1:03:54] hard it is or no how how much reasoning
[1:03:56] comes into play, you stay right with the
[1:03:59] word because people are counting on us.
[1:04:01] People are counting on you and your
[1:04:03] testimony to lead them into what God
[1:04:06] needs them to be because God will use
[1:04:08] you. He's just waiting for a willing
[1:04:10] vessel to use. God will use whatever
[1:04:13] willing vessel is willing to lay down
[1:04:15] their own will and then allow his will
[1:04:18] to be what is first place in their life.
[1:04:20] Amen.
[1:04:21] Glory to God.
[1:04:22] Hallelujah. You see, the Lord
[1:04:24] orchestrates things something sometimes
[1:04:26] just so beautifully to allow you to go
[1:04:28] through a certain circumstance
[1:04:32] just so that you have come to a place of
[1:04:35] unwavering faith and unwavering
[1:04:38] perseverance
[1:04:40] because faith knows no hindrances. So he
[1:04:44] drives you to a place where he can
[1:04:46] activate that faith that he put in you.
[1:04:49] Wow.
[1:04:50] So then that just takes that takes me
[1:04:52] out of the picture. Praise God. All I
[1:04:54] got to do is lift my hands and say,
[1:04:55] "Blessed be the name of the Lord."
[1:04:57] Glory to God. He drives you to a place
[1:05:00] that he can activate it. Glory to God.
[1:05:03] Let it be known and established in your
[1:05:04] hearts that when you pray the prayer of
[1:05:06] faith and you desire to draw closer to
[1:05:08] him, his way of doing that will of doing
[1:05:12] that thing is divine and it's perfect
[1:05:15] and he knows what's best. And sometime
[1:05:17] that divine will is a trial. Sometimes m
[1:05:20] maybe he wants to take you through
[1:05:22] something so other people can see that
[1:05:23] you that this can be done. Maybe it's a
[1:05:26] testimony. Whatever the case is, it's
[1:05:28] could be a trial. And if the devil if
[1:05:30] the devil never attacked us that would
[1:05:33] give me some red flags in my life that
[1:05:35] maybe maybe I'm just living a carnal
[1:05:37] life because the devil's not really
[1:05:39] worried about me. The devil's not I want
[1:05:42] to be on the devil's radar. I don't care
[1:05:44] what he what I have to go through for
[1:05:45] that. I want to be on the devil's radar
[1:05:47] to know that my life IS GOING TO CRUSH
[1:05:50] HIS SOUL one day. He doesn't have a
[1:05:51] soul. He's going to crush his head one
[1:05:53] day.
[1:05:54] Glory to God.
[1:05:55] Amen.
[1:05:56] Victory Day 1963. When you have a trial
[1:05:59] or a test, it shows the grace of God has
[1:06:01] found you and you found favor with God
[1:06:04] and God believes that you'll stand the
[1:06:06] test.
[1:06:07] Hallelujah.
[1:06:08] Glory to God. I'm going to read that one
[1:06:09] more time. When you have a trial or a
[1:06:11] test, it shows the grace of God has
[1:06:13] found you. You found favor with God. And
[1:06:15] God believes that you'll stand that
[1:06:17] test. Hallelujah.
[1:06:19] How secure can you be when the seas are
[1:06:22] troubled, when they're when they're not
[1:06:24] troubled, just don't make a bit of
[1:06:25] difference. He says, "As long as you
[1:06:26] know that he's laying right there, what
[1:06:28] difference does it make? Let come.
[1:06:30] Whatever. Let come. Let go. What may
[1:06:32] whatever it doesn't make a bit of
[1:06:33] difference?" Says, "Bless the Lord.
[1:06:34] Doctor says you're going to die with
[1:06:35] cancer." Just say, "GLORY TO GOD. Quick
[1:06:37] trip home." Maybe, see, they don't mind.
[1:06:39] Talking a group of doctors. He said, "I
[1:06:41] read your book." And he's, brother Bam's
[1:06:43] telling the story, you know, he he he
[1:06:45] was talking to this group of doctors and
[1:06:46] he and he read his book on divine
[1:06:48] healing. Brother Bam says, "I guess he
[1:06:50] criticized it, huh?" He said, "No, sir.
[1:06:52] I actually admit that you're right." I
[1:06:54] said, "Well, thank you, Dr. Shoen." He
[1:06:56] said, he said, "Brother Bam, we have
[1:06:58] record that when we tell a person that's
[1:07:00] got a malignancy or something that's
[1:07:01] going to kill them, an ulcer, ready to
[1:07:03] burst or tubercular, it depends on what
[1:07:05] attitude that they take, if they get all
[1:07:07] tore up, said they die right away." but
[1:07:10] said if they take that attitude well
[1:07:12] dying is just part of living it's all
[1:07:14] right when I die said you know it almost
[1:07:16] retards the case it almost just negates
[1:07:18] the case he says I just thought if that
[1:07:21] mental I just brother says if I just
[1:07:23] thought if that mental attitude taken
[1:07:25] like that what will it do when the Holy
[1:07:27] Spirit strikes that inner man
[1:07:29] glory to God he says certainly that's
[1:07:32] right if you can move into a spot into
[1:07:34] one of the one of the best surgeons and
[1:07:37] doctors there in the Southland he says
[1:07:38] if Mr. Brandom I can be proved a man if
[1:07:40] a man will move can move into a spot
[1:07:43] until even his own mind don't even know
[1:07:45] what he's got to think that he's got it
[1:07:47] and don't even pay attention to it said
[1:07:48] it wouldn't do it if he can't believe it
[1:07:50] that's true listen the right mental
[1:07:53] attitudes towards it will bring now the
[1:07:55] mind won't do it now listen the mind
[1:07:57] isn't going to do it but if you give
[1:07:59] that man that attitude towards something
[1:08:02] that has got LIFE IN IT OH THEN THAT
[1:08:05] LIFE comes down and that life does it
[1:08:07] hallelujah not your mental attitude all
[1:08:10] that only brings you into the presence
[1:08:12] of him. Then he does it. That's what you
[1:08:14] do your mind. The five senses is all
[1:08:17] right as long as they don't deny God.
[1:08:18] But when they go to denying God, then
[1:08:20] you leave them alone. God controls them.
[1:08:22] That's the creator. Glory to God. It's
[1:08:25] not your mental attitude that's going to
[1:08:26] do it. It can start with that mental
[1:08:28] attitude, but that just brings you into
[1:08:30] the presence of God and then he's the
[1:08:32] one that's going to do it. Glory to God.
[1:08:35] Amen.
[1:08:35] Thank you.
[1:08:36] Oh, praise the name of the Lord. He says
[1:08:38] in the God of this evil age, is this all
[1:08:39] right tonight, friends? Hallelujah. He
[1:08:41] says in the God of this evil age, but
[1:08:43] inside of that spirit is a soul and it's
[1:08:45] controlled by one thing. That's your
[1:08:46] free will. You can accept what the devil
[1:08:48] says or you can accept what God says.
[1:08:51] And that determines what spirit is in
[1:08:53] there. If it's the spirit of God, it
[1:08:55] will feed on the things of God.
[1:08:58] And it won't feed on anything. Um, this
[1:09:00] is just my comment. Can we say it
[1:09:01] together? Anything.
[1:09:03] Anything. It won't feed on anything of
[1:09:05] the world. Hallelujah. Jesus said, "If
[1:09:08] you love the world or the things of the
[1:09:10] world, it's because the love of God has
[1:09:12] not even entered into this inner part of
[1:09:14] you. Satan has deceived you, and man
[1:09:17] shall not live by bread alone, but by
[1:09:19] every word out of the mouth of God."
[1:09:21] Building to something here, but it's
[1:09:23] controlled by your free will. Amen. The
[1:09:26] devil's always going to try to
[1:09:27] complicate things. He's going to try to
[1:09:29] reason things down, say, "Well, you
[1:09:30] know, expect the best, but prepare for
[1:09:32] the worst." That's not faith. That's
[1:09:34] human reasoning. That's the devil's
[1:09:36] reasoning. Faith finds a source that
[1:09:38] others don't see. Hallelujah. How do you
[1:09:41] get there? How do you find that source?
[1:09:43] By hearing the word of God. By feeding
[1:09:45] your five senses with something that
[1:09:47] will feed that spiritual six sense. And
[1:09:50] then it'll press play. You go to church.
[1:09:52] You do those things. And then it takes
[1:09:54] you and it activates your faith that's
[1:09:56] laid within you. It it presents that
[1:09:59] that seed and it starts to grow and it
[1:10:01] starts to bake out those things. And
[1:10:03] then it manifests the word in your life.
[1:10:07] It will literally manifest the word in
[1:10:09] your life. Hallelujah.
[1:10:10] Wow.
[1:10:11] Hallelujah.
[1:10:11] Glory.
[1:10:12] We start honoring God in every avenue of
[1:10:15] our everyday life. Don't let God be in
[1:10:17] most places. Don't let him be in, you
[1:10:20] know, [snorts] some of the rooms in your
[1:10:21] heart. Let him have everything.
[1:10:23] Hallelujah. Let him be the savior of
[1:10:25] your life and the lord of your life.
[1:10:29] Submit it to him. And brother Random
[1:10:30] says here referring in the church age
[1:10:33] book referring to Ephesians 3:16. Now
[1:10:35] according to these verses, when a man
[1:10:37] experiences the depth of God in his
[1:10:40] life, it is an actual personal
[1:10:42] experience of the spirit of God
[1:10:45] indwelling him and his mind is
[1:10:47] illuminated by the wisdom and the
[1:10:48] knowledge of God through the word.
[1:10:51] But the depth of Satan will always be in
[1:10:55] that. He will attempt to destroy this.
[1:10:58] He will always attempt to make a
[1:11:00] substitute for the reality of God. How
[1:11:03] will he do that? He will take away the
[1:11:05] knowledge of the truth of God. Destroy
[1:11:08] the word by put putting forth his own
[1:11:10] word. And brother Brandham says in here
[1:11:12] in quotes, "Yay hath God said?" And
[1:11:15] remember when brother Jason um brought
[1:11:16] that out there in Genesis where the
[1:11:18] serpent deceived Eve in Genesis because
[1:11:20] he took away the lordship of God. It
[1:11:23] started with Lord God. And then the
[1:11:25] serpent took away one word, added a
[1:11:27] little reasoning, added a little
[1:11:29] discouragement, added a little
[1:11:31] worldliness to something, just enough to
[1:11:33] where it actually looked all right
[1:11:35] because it's still God.
[1:11:36] It looked all right. It appeared as if
[1:11:38] nothing was wrong, but it was Satan
[1:11:41] destroying the word of God in her life.
[1:11:45] Amen.
[1:11:45] It was Satan trying to take away your
[1:11:47] victory. It was Satan trying to
[1:11:49] discourage you from living right. It was
[1:11:51] Satan trying to attempting to destroy
[1:11:53] the depth of God in our lives.
[1:11:57] My goodness, he will. He is going and he
[1:12:01] will always try his very best to do
[1:12:03] that.
[1:12:04] Yeah.
[1:12:05] That's why we take this message that's
[1:12:08] that the Lord gave us and we say amen to
[1:12:10] every word. Hallelujah. The enemy is
[1:12:13] attempting to destroy the life the the
[1:12:15] word of God in your life. He'll try to
[1:12:17] do those things. He'll try to take away
[1:12:18] your healing by reasoning out those
[1:12:21] things just like he'll try to have you
[1:12:22] justify your actions just like he did
[1:12:24] Abraham. Well, what I'm doing isn't
[1:12:27] wrong or maybe there's no scripture
[1:12:28] against it. Yet, you stand there
[1:12:30] convicted in your heart of that thing.
[1:12:32] He's trying to steal away your victory.
[1:12:34] That's right.
[1:12:36] The devil does not care if you have a
[1:12:38] mental understanding of Jesus or who
[1:12:41] Jesus is or take some worldly view of
[1:12:44] accepting him. He fears the life behind
[1:12:47] the name.
[1:12:48] Amen.
[1:12:49] There is a certain amount of overcoming
[1:12:51] that we're taught in the scripture to
[1:12:53] possess. He that overcomemeth. So there
[1:12:55] is something that we do have to do on
[1:12:57] our end. And brother brother Jason
[1:12:59] shared this quote with the brothers one
[1:13:00] day and he says now there's going to be
[1:13:03] a bride. There's going to be a wedding
[1:13:04] supper served in the skies here in the
[1:13:06] marriage of the lamb 1962 paragraph 53.
[1:13:08] He says now just as sure to be as God is
[1:13:11] because it's his word. And we know that
[1:13:13] those things are going to make up that
[1:13:16] bride is going to be his church. And
[1:13:18] they're going to appear with him before
[1:13:21] him without spot or wrinkle. They have,
[1:13:24] listen, they have the material on earth
[1:13:27] now to make themselves ready. The
[1:13:29] message. Hallelujah. The Holy Spirit.
[1:13:31] Amen. If you notice, she has made
[1:13:34] herself ready. So, [snorts] so many
[1:13:36] says, "If the Lord will take this evil
[1:13:38] spirit from me or drinking or gambling
[1:13:40] or lying or stealing, I'll serve him."
[1:13:43] But that's up to you. See, you got
[1:13:45] something, too. They that overcome shall
[1:13:49] inherit all things.
[1:13:51] She has made herself ready. You have
[1:13:56] power to do it, but you must be willing
[1:13:58] to lay it down. See,
[1:13:59] you see, God could not push us through a
[1:14:02] little pipe, pull us out the other end,
[1:14:04] and then say, "Blessed is he that
[1:14:06] overcomemeth."
[1:14:07] You had nothing to overcome.
[1:14:10] He just pushed you through. But you've
[1:14:11] got decisions for yourself. I have to
[1:14:13] make decisions for myself in doing that.
[1:14:15] That's how Brother Brandham says we show
[1:14:17] our faith and respect to God.
[1:14:20] Amen.
[1:14:20] Oh my. Our respects to God. Thanks be to
[1:14:24] God. It shows me that the Lord loves me
[1:14:27] when I'm going through something. That's
[1:14:29] contrary to what you would think it
[1:14:31] would be, but it shows me that I that
[1:14:34] the Lord loves me because he places
[1:14:36] something in my life that he wants that
[1:14:38] he wants to show his word to me. He let
[1:14:40] us glory in those trials. He says
[1:14:42] they're so precious to me. So when he
[1:14:44] blesses me with a trial, oh my, it's
[1:14:46] really hard to look at a trial like that
[1:14:48] sometimes. But it gives us an
[1:14:50] opportunity to show our respects to God.
[1:14:54] Hallelujah. We do have something to do
[1:14:58] on our end. How do we overcome? Is it
[1:15:01] just some giant fancy words or maybe I
[1:15:03] maybe I could compile a list of all the
[1:15:05] the best quotes and then you just start
[1:15:07] saying those quotes over and over and
[1:15:08] over again and then you just hope that
[1:15:10] it happens. No, we have we have a we
[1:15:13] start with that mental conception and
[1:15:15] then we have faith by hearing and by
[1:15:17] hearing of the word of God. We plant
[1:15:19] that. We know that seed's already been
[1:15:21] planted. So then we allow it to grow in
[1:15:23] our lives and then it manifests the word
[1:15:26] in your life.
[1:15:27] It's not some great hope that hopefully
[1:15:29] nothing bad is ever going to happen. He
[1:15:31] overcame it by how? How did Jesus
[1:15:33] overcome Satan in the scriptures? He
[1:15:35] overcame it by the word. It is written.
[1:15:38] Hallelujah. What else is written? I am
[1:15:40] the Lord that health all die the
[1:15:42] diseases that will keep Isaiah 26:3, a
[1:15:46] perfect peace. Uh Jehovah Gyra, I'm your
[1:15:49] provider. All of these things are your
[1:15:51] promises in the Bible that manifest to
[1:15:54] you when you hear the word of God. You
[1:15:56] apply it to your life and then you move
[1:15:58] forward in it. Hallelujah.
[1:16:00] Perfect peace is a place that knowing
[1:16:03] that I've already overcome it because
[1:16:05] he's living in me. And in Revelation
[1:16:07] 11:17 and 18, he already overcame hell
[1:16:10] and death and the grave. And he has the
[1:16:12] keys to it. Hallelujah.
[1:16:14] Glory to God.
[1:16:17] In me, you might have peace. I have
[1:16:20] overcome the world. He says, hallelujah.
[1:16:23] You overcome by the blood of the lamb
[1:16:25] that's already been shed
[1:16:27] and then by the word of your testimony.
[1:16:29] Hallelujah. Yeah.
[1:16:30] Even if [snorts] every appointment you
[1:16:32] go to the doctors seemed like they think
[1:16:34] that it's getting just getting worse and
[1:16:35] worse and they want you to just keep
[1:16:37] coming back and back, it does not matter
[1:16:39] because the word of my testimony is that
[1:16:42] it is already done. That little baby is
[1:16:45] already healed and I'm standing on that
[1:16:47] promise. That's all there is to it.
[1:16:49] Hallelujah. Don't fret, little child. We
[1:16:51] walk by faith, not by sight. And faith
[1:16:54] finds a source that others don't see. Oh
[1:16:56] my. This quote has meant so much to me
[1:16:58] lately. Brother Donnie, I may have even
[1:17:00] quoted it here. Remember, when God
[1:17:02] counted you worthy to have a test, don't
[1:17:04] fail to get this. When you have a test
[1:17:06] or a trial, it shows the grace of God
[1:17:09] has found you. And God believes that
[1:17:12] you're going to stay in that test.
[1:17:13] Hallelujah. He did the very same thing
[1:17:15] by Job. Hallelujah. God says he's in
[1:17:18] your hands, but you don't take his life.
[1:17:20] See, God had confidence in Job. Amen.
[1:17:23] Oh, my precious wife, she sent me this
[1:17:25] text last night, and it just it meant so
[1:17:27] much to me. Oh, she said she was driving
[1:17:29] home. We had a doctor's appointment on
[1:17:31] Monday, and most of you know the
[1:17:32] situation. And you know, we stand on
[1:17:35] faith, but it does not mean that the
[1:17:36] discouragements don't come. The
[1:17:38] discouragements are going to come. The
[1:17:39] mind battles are going to come, right?
[1:17:41] That happens. And she said she was
[1:17:42] driving home from her par from my
[1:17:45] parents and she was just really feeling
[1:17:46] down and discouraged and she was
[1:17:48] listening a victory day and she sent me
[1:17:50] this. Oh, it means so much. When when it
[1:17:52] looks like everything is God gone, God
[1:17:55] is giving you a trial. He's got
[1:17:57] confidence in you. He doesn't have to
[1:17:58] baby you around. You're not a hotbed
[1:18:01] plant, a hybrid. You are a real
[1:18:03] Christian. Hallelujah. God is giving you
[1:18:05] a test to see what you'll do about it.
[1:18:07] Amen. No matter Peter said these fiery
[1:18:10] trials, why we count it as joy? It's
[1:18:12] more precious than gold. How many times
[1:18:14] we him and haw well what if that or what
[1:18:16] if something gave you to overcome? He
[1:18:18] just knows he put his trust in you.
[1:18:21] Hallelujah. He put his trust in you.
[1:18:24] Glory to God.
[1:18:26] Faith cometh by hearing.
[1:18:29] He placed you as a member of the bride
[1:18:31] of Jesus Christ.
[1:18:34] So, you know, when the doctor tells me
[1:18:36] that my unborn child has a hole in her
[1:18:37] heart, tests positive for a condition
[1:18:39] that's going to kill her. I stand as an
[1:18:41] overcomer and it's just the Lord saying,
[1:18:43] "You watch this. I put my confidence in
[1:18:45] my children. What about the mind battles
[1:18:47] that come with it? What about the
[1:18:48] playing? They're going to happen. It
[1:18:51] doesn't matter. He's got my word."
[1:18:54] That's all he needs, brother. Brother
[1:18:55] Donnie did that wonderful demonstration
[1:18:57] of just thinking about what's standing
[1:18:58] over the banisher of time. He's got my
[1:19:00] word and he's going to stand on it. You
[1:19:02] just watch, devil. You just watch
[1:19:04] whatever you're going through in your
[1:19:05] life, you just stand on it because God's
[1:19:07] got this. He's going to take control of
[1:19:09] whatever situation, whatever mind
[1:19:10] battle, whatever victory that you did
[1:19:12] have maybe this weekend or maybe maybe
[1:19:14] even tonight. Whatever victory that you
[1:19:16] have, you have got that victory. It is
[1:19:18] already yours. You already possess it.
[1:19:20] You just keep moving forward in it. You
[1:19:22] believe it. You hear the word of God.
[1:19:24] You put your faith in that and then you
[1:19:26] stand with it.
[1:19:27] Hallelujah.
[1:19:29] Glory to God.
[1:19:31] My victory day. Go listen to victory day
[1:19:33] when you get a chance. Hallelujah. My
[1:19:35] victory day is God's confidence
[1:19:37] in us. Glory to God. When you come in,
[1:19:39] when the when the devil comes in like a
[1:19:41] flood, the spirit of the Lord will rise
[1:19:43] a standard against him.
[1:19:45] Amen.
[1:19:45] No weapon formed against me shall
[1:19:47] prosper. Glory to God. That's our
[1:19:49] victory day, saints. Grab a hold of it.
[1:19:51] Keep with it. He says here it seems like
[1:19:54] the Christian life if the fellow is not
[1:19:56] absolutely centered on Christ. Now
[1:19:58] that's the most important thing. You got
[1:20:00] to be absolutely centered on Christ.
[1:20:03] It seems like he holds so many
[1:20:05] disappointments. But but those
[1:20:07] disappointments are God's divine will
[1:20:10] happening for us. So now it don't even
[1:20:13] seem like it would be that. But it's
[1:20:14] God's way of doing things. He lets us
[1:20:17] hit the river to see what we'll do.
[1:20:21] Oh, glory to God. when you hit the
[1:20:23] river. What courage that ought to be for
[1:20:25] a sick person. What courage that ought
[1:20:27] to be for a backslider. He says to stay
[1:20:29] in the line of duty to turn yourself
[1:20:31] around to start back to start back. It's
[1:20:34] God business to open up the Red Seas.
[1:20:37] It's God's business. You just speak and
[1:20:39] you move forward. That's all you have to
[1:20:42] do. Glory to God. You stay in the line
[1:20:44] of duty.
[1:20:44] Hallelujah.
[1:20:46] Faith cometh by hearing.
[1:20:49] God lets disappointments happen to show
[1:20:51] victory.
[1:20:53] Oh, if we could only see that you see
[1:20:54] these things that seem so blurring, so
[1:20:56] burring to you and upsetting you.
[1:20:57] They're trials. They're things that
[1:20:58] stand still. Focus your glasses on the
[1:21:00] word of God. Speak the word and move
[1:21:02] forward. That's all there is to do it.
[1:21:04] Glory to God. How do you have how do you
[1:21:06] grab hold of that determined faith? How
[1:21:08] do you how do you possess it, Caleb?
[1:21:10] You're talking about victory and you're
[1:21:12] talking about faith and cometh by
[1:21:14] hearing and then faith is a substance.
[1:21:16] How do you how do you take that thing
[1:21:17] and you grab hold of it? Brother says in
[1:21:20] the main thing Jacob he had dreams and
[1:21:21] visions and so forth but this is one
[1:21:24] time he could lay his hand on something
[1:21:25] and say that this is God and he was able
[1:21:28] to hold on to it onto it until the
[1:21:30] blessing comes. Oh, if we could just do
[1:21:33] that we could find a spot where where we
[1:21:35] could see God whether it's in his word
[1:21:37] whatever it is recognize it's God and
[1:21:40] hold on to it until the blessing comes.
[1:21:43] You wrestle it out with God. God
[1:21:45] promised to do it. God said, "If we'd
[1:21:47] seek, we'd find, ask, it will be given.
[1:21:50] Knock, it'll open. Every word is true."
[1:21:52] When Jacob got a hold of something that
[1:21:54] he could look at to hold with his hands,
[1:21:55] when he seen that it was God, he would
[1:21:57] not turn it loose. Oh, if Christian said
[1:22:00] in the unchangeable God 1960, oh, if
[1:22:02] Christian could do that, lay your hold
[1:22:04] of something that's real. Catch a vision
[1:22:06] of God and see his presence. Hold on to
[1:22:08] it until God answers black back and that
[1:22:11] blessing. What a revival would break out
[1:22:13] here in Tulsa. He said, "What a revival
[1:22:15] would break out here in Bethl Tabernacle
[1:22:16] if we could take a hold of that promise.
[1:22:18] You hold on to it. You stick with it. No
[1:22:20] matter what form it comes in, we have
[1:22:21] our ideas, but God has a way of sending
[1:22:25] things to us and answering our prayers
[1:22:27] every time." You remember there in in
[1:22:29] Daniel 10
[1:22:31] when Daniel prayed and the vision broke
[1:22:34] forth. He says, "Daniel, I heard you
[1:22:35] from the very first day that you began
[1:22:38] praying 21 days ago, but I had to battle
[1:22:40] with the enemy to come and make my way
[1:22:42] here. But rest assured, everything is
[1:22:45] going to be okay.
[1:22:47] Everything is in control." Oh, rest,
[1:22:49] little bride. It's all in control. I've
[1:22:52] got it all. I've already overcome it.
[1:22:54] Just rest. Just Just stay right with the
[1:22:56] word. Just stay right with your faith.
[1:22:58] Just just keep hearing my word. Just
[1:23:00] keep saying amen to all of it. You just
[1:23:02] stay with it. Whatever it is, whatever
[1:23:04] situation, whatever, it does not matter.
[1:23:07] Whatever he decides for my life, he's
[1:23:09] sovereign. So, he's going to decide it
[1:23:11] because he's sovereign. He knows best.
[1:23:13] So, I'm just going to accept it and move
[1:23:14] forward for it. Amen.
[1:23:16] Rest assured, little bride. He's working
[1:23:19] on his end. Daniel was so weakened in
[1:23:23] that prayer. And that can happen. I it
[1:23:25] happens to all of us. We can sometimes
[1:23:27] feel so weak, maybe so weak in our faith
[1:23:29] or so down or discouraged or mind
[1:23:31] battles or we don't have victory or we
[1:23:33] got this or we got that. Amen.
[1:23:37] Amen. But the hand of the Lord touches
[1:23:39] him and gives him strength from his
[1:23:42] travail. The Lord knows exactly what you
[1:23:45] need when you need it.
[1:23:48] Amen.
[1:23:50] Glory to God.
[1:23:52] sounds so contrary. You know, maybe just
[1:23:55] tonight if we just all stands to our
[1:23:57] feet tonight.
[1:24:01] So many things about the scripture may
[1:24:02] sound so contrary to to reasoning and
[1:24:05] even even just talking with a co-orker
[1:24:09] today about faith and she had this
[1:24:12] comment and I I told her, you know,
[1:24:14] faith, you know, is the substance of
[1:24:17] things hoped for. It's the evidence of
[1:24:18] not things not seen. Evidence is
[1:24:20] something that furnished proof. And then
[1:24:22] my and then she kind of piped up and she
[1:24:24] said, "Oh, and the the the proof isn't
[1:24:25] furnished yet." I said, "Yeah, the proof
[1:24:27] is furnished. It's in the word that he
[1:24:29] health all my diseases." So that's my
[1:24:31] that's my furnished proof that it's
[1:24:33] already done. And she just said, "Well,
[1:24:35] that's kind of a backwards way of
[1:24:36] looking at it." I said, "Well, yeah, I
[1:24:38] guess it is, but that's what the word
[1:24:40] says to do." Amen. You stay with that.
[1:24:43] Maybe tonight you needed a little bit of
[1:24:45] of encouragement. And you know, he need
[1:24:47] you he knew you needed to hear his word
[1:24:49] to put the right amount of light or
[1:24:51] sunshine on your faith and bring it
[1:24:54] forth. Amen.
[1:24:56] We started there. We opened up with with
[1:24:58] Jacob
[1:25:00] just play with with whatever's on your
[1:25:02] heart. Actually, let's let's uh what's
[1:25:05] that song I wanted to sing? Let me look
[1:25:06] at this song. Uh I give my mind I give
[1:25:10] my mind completely to you, Lord. You
[1:25:11] know that one? Okay.
[1:25:14] When Jacob stands there,
[1:25:17] Jacob's battle came. You know, he had
[1:25:19] the blessing of his father. He
[1:25:22] experienced the supernatural many times
[1:25:24] in his life.
[1:25:26] He came face to face with angels. He had
[1:25:28] visions. He dreamed dreams. Then even
[1:25:30] leading up to his experience, you see
[1:25:32] Jacob on this road faced with fear to
[1:25:35] see his brother after all these years
[1:25:37] because he knew that Esau had made that
[1:25:40] declaration to kill him.
[1:25:43] And that's why Jacob was sent away. And
[1:25:45] the Lord sends in that dream, "Go back
[1:25:47] into the land of thy kindred." So we He
[1:25:50] had the message from the Lord. Go back
[1:25:51] into that land. We have the message from
[1:25:54] the Lord. Amen.
[1:25:55] Yeah.
[1:25:56] We have that message. He had his
[1:25:59] mission. Go back into that land. We have
[1:26:01] our mission. Take God at his word. We
[1:26:04] move forward with it. Then on his way,
[1:26:06] scripture says that the angels of God
[1:26:08] met Jacob. Even after all that, just a
[1:26:10] few verses later, he was still afraid.
[1:26:14] Verse 7 in chapter 32 of Genesis says he
[1:26:17] was greatly afraid and distressed. Then
[1:26:19] in that fear, he tries to come up with
[1:26:20] his own plan. Saints, tonight when when
[1:26:23] you do stand at that very point, Jacob
[1:26:25] did. You have the word of the Lord. I
[1:26:27] promise you, every single time that fear
[1:26:30] and doubt, they'll try their best to
[1:26:31] overcome you. They'll [snorts] explain
[1:26:33] away that victory. They'll they'll place
[1:26:35] a thought of that. But let let those
[1:26:39] thought be fuel to the fire of the Holy
[1:26:43] Ghost that's in you. Let those thoughts
[1:26:45] be fire and fuel that if those thoughts
[1:26:48] are happening, if those things are are
[1:26:50] trying to to to get you to doubt
[1:26:52] something, then something is real.
[1:26:53] Something is something is anchored in
[1:26:55] you. Amen. Jacob said, "And I Jacob
[1:26:59] said, I'm I'm not even worthy of the
[1:27:01] least of thy mercies." Oh, that's that's
[1:27:03] me. I'm not even wor worthy of the least
[1:27:05] of thy mercies or all thy truth. He
[1:27:08] says, but he says, deliver me. I think
[1:27:11] every believer tonight can raise their
[1:27:13] hands and say, identify with that. I'm
[1:27:15] not even worthy of the least of thy
[1:27:17] mercies and thy truth. That truth of the
[1:27:20] message you've given us. I'm not even
[1:27:21] worthy of it, Lord.
[1:27:23] Oh, but deliver me, Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:27:27] Glory to God.
[1:27:29] We have these words. We have the
[1:27:31] promises. Yet, circumstances arise and
[1:27:34] we forget who we are. And I'm here
[1:27:37] tonight to remind you of who you are.
[1:27:40] I'm here tonight to remind you of your
[1:27:42] position.
[1:27:44] It's all part of his divine plan.
[1:27:46] Finally, Jacob gets so sick of himself
[1:27:48] and his fears and his mess ups and
[1:27:50] cowardly behavior. He finds himself
[1:27:52] alone with God. No wife, no son, no
[1:27:56] daughter, no distraction. And he started
[1:27:59] wrestling it out.
[1:28:01] And then this is where he says God he
[1:28:04] sees God face to face like the scripture
[1:28:06] says. Brother Brandham says it
[1:28:07] beautifully there. He walks differently
[1:28:09] after that. But from that time he
[1:28:11] [music] was a and then in the in the
[1:28:12] first verse of the next chapter Jacob
[1:28:14] lifted up his eyes.
[1:28:17] Just drown out the cares [music] of life
[1:28:19] tonight. The thoughts of discouragement
[1:28:21] the the pressures. Let's lift our eyes
[1:28:24] tonight. [music]
[1:28:24] We have our message
[1:28:28] keep in step little bride.
[1:28:29] Amen. Listen to my word. Diligently seek
[1:28:33] him. He's a rewarder for those that
[1:28:35] diligently seek him. Verse 6, chapter
[1:28:38] Hebrews. [music] And he is faithful. Die
[1:28:40] out to your will and let's have a
[1:28:42] victory today knowing that it's time for
[1:28:45] our prodigals to come home. Amen. It's
[1:28:48] time for our faith to rise up into
[1:28:49] another atmosphere and to turn the
[1:28:52] tides.
[1:28:52] Amen.
[1:28:54] Hallelujah. Let's just bow our hearts
[1:28:56] before the Lord. Heavenly Father, Lord,
[1:28:59] we thank you for the word that you
[1:29:00] brought forth to us tonight, Father. We
[1:29:03] accept it and we believe it, Lord.
[1:29:05] Father, we just give you praise and
[1:29:08] honor and glory tonight, Father. Lord,
[1:29:10] it's in our it's in our makeup, Lord,
[1:29:13] for that nature of that old flesh of
[1:29:15] mind, Father, to get in the way. And
[1:29:17] Lord, for there's hindrances and it's
[1:29:19] just in that flesh of mind. But Lord
[1:29:21] God, something deep inside just screams
[1:29:23] that I love you, Lord, and I want to be
[1:29:25] right with you, Lord. And I just lay on
[1:29:27] that bosom of of of Jesus tonight. And I
[1:29:29] just ask, Lord, if there's anything in
[1:29:31] there [music] that may be besetting in
[1:29:33] my life, Lord, is there anything in
[1:29:35] there, Father, that you would want to me
[1:29:37] want me to rid of so that that so that
[1:29:39] that right temperature, Lord, can just,
[1:29:42] Lord, shine on that seed that I know
[1:29:44] that is in there. Father, I pray that
[1:29:46] you would just bring it to light
[1:29:48] tonight. Father God, you'd [music] just
[1:29:49] manifest yourself in the the hearts and
[1:29:52] the lives of these believers here
[1:29:53] tonight. Father, I pray for each one of
[1:29:54] them. Father, Lord, I pray that you'd go
[1:29:57] with them and be with them. Encourage
[1:29:58] them in their walk with you, Lord, and
[1:30:00] just give them a little bit more
[1:30:01] strength to keep pressing on and to keep
[1:30:03] in step. Father, we love you so much.
[1:30:05] And we thank you for the word that you
[1:30:07] brought forth, Lord. And we just give
[1:30:09] you praise tonight. Ask all these
[1:30:10] things, Lord, in the wonderful, precious
[1:30:13] name of Jesus Christ.
[1:30:16] Amen. Let's just sing that song just for
[1:30:18] a moment.
[1:30:22] Let's
[1:30:22] just worship the Lord.
[1:30:25] lead to [music] you,
[1:30:29] Lord.
[1:30:31] Fill me with your thoughts.
[1:30:37] Make [singing] it all brand new.
[1:30:42] Change my heart.
[1:30:44] Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. [music]
[1:30:49] Let me [singing] live in all that's
[1:30:52] [music] true.
[1:30:58] I just want to think
[1:31:01] like
[1:31:03] you
[1:31:05] [music]
[1:31:07] I give [singing] my life
[1:31:13] completely to you
[1:31:17] Lord. [singing]
[1:31:20] Yes.
[1:31:22] I give my life

[1:35:40] Amen. Thanks [music] be to God. Just
[1:35:42] waiting on a text. We're going to take
[1:35:44] up some requests tonight. And uh we have
[1:35:47] brother Bruce Paris [music] here. He
[1:35:49] says, "Good morning, my dear family and
[1:35:51] Christian brothers. Just a quick update
[1:35:52] regarding my recent headlong dive into
[1:35:55] my activities. My head wound [music] is
[1:35:57] responding nicely to the the natural
[1:35:59] healing process. However, the other
[1:36:01] members of this aging vessel are now
[1:36:03] beginning to complain that being ignored
[1:36:05] by manifesting their displeasure and
[1:36:07] revealing [music] that they made contact
[1:36:09] with that resilient material called
[1:36:11] concrete.
[1:36:13] My forehead has become swollen. My right
[1:36:15] knee has turned a bruising yellow color
[1:36:18] along with my left finger and knuckle.
[1:36:20] In spite of all the complaints my
[1:36:21] [music] brain is receiving, I'm pleased
[1:36:23] to say that the Lord, my savior and
[1:36:25] Jesus Christ, has spared me from
[1:36:27] complete destruction once again for
[1:36:30] whatever [music] purpose he sees fit.
[1:36:31] Amen.
[1:36:32] Amen.
[1:36:32] Each individual needs to take stock of
[1:36:34] the fact that we're predisposed to God's
[1:36:36] perfect will for our lives. It's by his
[1:36:39] great love for as sons and daughters,
[1:36:41] vessels of honor, which entitles us to
[1:36:43] his many promises. Amen. He's preaching
[1:36:45] to us. One is that he would prosper in
[1:36:47] health. I'm a testimony of his great
[1:36:49] mercy. For he has spared me from [music]
[1:36:51] the im imminent destruction by his grace
[1:36:54] many times. Thank you for all the many
[1:36:56] prayers [music] and well wishes. God
[1:36:58] bless each of you. Oh, was I supposed to
[1:37:01] read the whole thing? [music]
[1:37:03] Amen. Praise the Lord. Military

[1:38:18] Father God. Lord, sometimes our our
[1:38:20] minds, our bodies, they don't exactly,
[1:38:22] Father God, measure up to the word. But
[1:38:24] Lord, we accept the word on the basis of
[1:38:26] the faith that we that we've heard
[1:38:28] tonight, Father. We accept it. We accept
[1:38:30] faith based on your word, Father.

[1:38:50] go and you'd, Lord, do what you do best,
[1:38:53] Father God. You'd be in control of the
[1:38:54] situation, Father. There's many needs
[1:38:56] here tonight, Father. [music] I pray
[1:38:58] that each you'd just take each one of us
[1:38:59] home safely tonight, Father God. And
[1:39:01] Lord, if there be a testimony tonight
[1:39:03] that you'd lay on someone's heart, Lord
[1:39:05] God, let it just be fuel to the fire of
[1:39:07] the Holy Ghost in our lives tonight.
[1:39:08] Father, thank you for [music] the word
[1:39:10] that you've given us. Thank you for all
[1:39:12] you do in our lives, Father. We love you
[1:39:14] now. And we ask all these things [music]
[1:39:16] in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:39:18] Amen.
[1:39:18] Amen. Amen. Do we have any testimonies
[1:39:21] [music] here tonight? Any testimonies?
[1:39:24] Any testimonies? We hand that back to
[1:39:26] us.
[1:39:32] Um the boys me twice during this trip.
[1:39:37] Um the first time we landed at for our
[1:39:41] layover in Dallas Love airport and I had
[1:39:45] had less than two and a half hours of
[1:39:47] sleep uh in 24 hours. And I had drank
[1:39:51] some awful hot chocolate on the plane
[1:39:55] because I wanted to drink something warm
[1:39:57] and soothing, but I didn't want to drink
[1:39:59] coffee and keep myself awake if I could
[1:40:01] go to sleep. And then when we got to the
[1:40:03] airport, I ate some
[1:40:06] just junk food. And uh all of a sudden,
[1:40:10] I just I mean, my brain was jello. I was
[1:40:13] getting bodyachches. And my stomach is
[1:40:16] just churning and churning and churning.
[1:40:19] and didn't want to accept even water. Um
[1:40:23] and then all of a sudden in front of
[1:40:25] hundreds of people, my son Milo started
[1:40:28] praying for me [laughter]
[1:40:30] and um 30 minutes later it was like
[1:40:35] nothing had ever happened.
[1:40:38] Amen.
[1:40:38] So the innocent faith of a child
[1:40:42] Amen.
[1:40:42] that hasn't been corrupted yet by the
[1:40:44] world. [laughter]
[1:40:45] You know, that's the kind of faith that
[1:40:46] he wants us to have. Amen.
[1:40:49] And um and then the other thing that
[1:40:53] happened, I think I came in contact with
[1:40:55] somebody who had something uh right when
[1:40:58] I got here. Um and I started feeling it
[1:41:03] like the next day in my throat and I
[1:41:06] thought, "Oh, well, it's just my sinuses
[1:41:08] because I always have sinus issues." and
[1:41:11] the burning drainage. And it just kept
[1:41:14] getting worse and worse and worse. And
[1:41:17] by the time I got home, got back that
[1:41:20] night, I had full-on fever,
[1:41:23] um, chills, bodyachches, just awful. And
[1:41:29] um
[1:41:32] to preface this, you know, the devil was
[1:41:36] trying [snorts] so hard to stop me from
[1:41:41] getting to those services this weekend.
[1:41:44] I mean, everything was going wrong. And
[1:41:48] just like brother Andrew Glover said,
[1:41:50] you know, your spirit and your flesh are
[1:41:53] ready to give up, but something on the
[1:41:57] inside of the soul
[1:41:59] is, you know, and God was kind of quiet
[1:42:02] through all of it. And I'm like, Lord,
[1:42:04] what's going on? Is this, you know, is
[1:42:07] this trip not your will? What's what's
[1:42:09] happening? And I thought, no, that can't
[1:42:11] be it. You know, why would the Lord want
[1:42:14] to stop me from hearing the word? you
[1:42:16] know, I've gotta get there. Our plan
[1:42:18] plane leaves at 5:40. Service starts at
[1:42:21] 7. Gotta get there. [laughter]
[1:42:24] And even just uh feeling um tired on the
[1:42:29] drive there, thinking, well, you know,
[1:42:32] and then Milo falls asleep in the car
[1:42:34] and nobody's feeling great. And I'm
[1:42:36] thinking, well, maybe we'll just skip
[1:42:38] this one service and it'll be okay. And
[1:42:42] I and then I said, no, I am not doing
[1:42:45] it. I am getting there because
[1:42:49] it it was like the devil wanted me to be
[1:42:51] in a position where I couldn't even
[1:42:55] stream the services, not even hear it
[1:42:58] because he knew that Saturday service I
[1:43:02] was going to get exactly what I needed
[1:43:06] to fight against what he had been doing
[1:43:09] to me in my mind
[1:43:11] for several weeks. Just nonstop.
[1:43:14] Just the doubt. Oh, it really it's you
[1:43:18] [snorts] can't be one of them. Do you
[1:43:21] remember what you did? Do you remember
[1:43:24] how bad you were? I don't think so. Not
[1:43:26] you. You know that kind of thing.
[1:43:29] But I got exactly what I needed. I'm
[1:43:31] free.
[1:43:32] Amen.
[1:43:32] I have liberty.
[1:43:34] Thank you, Lord.
[1:43:34] And I am living the jubilee. Amen.
[1:43:37] And you can't do anything about it. And
[1:43:38] I'm not going to do anything to offend
[1:43:40] my Lord.
[1:43:41] Amen. And so
[1:43:44] the joy that came with hearing the word
[1:43:49] and that blessed assurance that the Lord
[1:43:51] was with me and he wanted me to hear
[1:43:53] that and I passed. It was like I don't
[1:43:56] know if that was a test but whatever it
[1:43:57] was I passed and I got there
[1:44:00] and I got what I needed. And when I was
[1:44:05] um thinking about giving this testimony
[1:44:08] last night [laughter] in the middle of
[1:44:10] the night, I promise you this happened.
[1:44:12] I thought, Lord, how am I going to
[1:44:14] explain this that would help other
[1:44:16] people? Because I have faith for lots of
[1:44:18] things in life, but faith for my own
[1:44:21] healing has been an issue. like I can
[1:44:23] pray for somebody else's healing and I
[1:44:25] have all the faith but for my own it's
[1:44:28] like again the devil gets in there and
[1:44:31] but okay I'm
[1:44:34] so when I was sick
[1:44:37] I prayed
[1:44:39] and it the prayer was different
[1:44:42] because I had that joy of that blessed
[1:44:44] assurance
[1:44:45] and I fell asleep between 11:30 and 12
[1:44:50] and at 2:25 I woke up
[1:44:54] and I was like, "Oh my goodness, my
[1:44:58] symptoms are gone."
[1:45:00] Um,
[1:45:01] and
[1:45:03] I I mean, I was healed. And when I was
[1:45:06] thinking about how can I give this
[1:45:09] testimony and help somebody else who's
[1:45:11] having the same issue,
[1:45:14] that exact scripture came to me, which
[1:45:16] was um,
[1:45:18] faith comes by hearing.
[1:45:20] Amen. The devil did not want me to get
[1:45:22] there and get that faith from hearing
[1:45:25] and it happened anyway.
[1:45:27] Wow. Amen.
[1:45:29] So, thank you.
[1:45:30] Amen. [applause]
[1:45:35] Anybody else have a testimony tonight?
[1:45:37] [applause]
[1:45:42] This is something that kind of happened
[1:45:43] a while ago, but I was telling it to
[1:45:45] someone the other night and I was like,
[1:45:46] "This is, you know, pretty cool, so I'm
[1:45:48] going to share it." But um I was driving
[1:45:51] home from work and I realized that I was
[1:45:55] out of gas. I had like no gas and I was
[1:45:57] kind of on kind of a back roads and
[1:45:59] there there are no gas stations and I
[1:46:00] was like broke at the time.
[1:46:02] [sighs and gasps] So I was like God put
[1:46:05] it on my heart to just start praying. I
[1:46:07] was like, "Lord, I'm broke. There's like
[1:46:08] no gas stations. I have no way to get
[1:46:10] gas." So I sat there and watched the gas
[1:46:13] meter dial thing literally like go up.
[1:46:16] Wow. And God literally filled my tank up
[1:46:18] with gas in that moment. So, I thought
[1:46:20] that I would share that.
[1:46:23] [applause]
[1:46:24] Praise the Lord. Amen. Probably have
[1:46:26] time for one more. Anybody have anybody
[1:46:28] have another one?
[1:46:33] Uh this is uh kind of a it might not
[1:46:36] mean a lot to a lot of people, but it
[1:46:38] meant a lot to me. Um the other day I
[1:46:40] was driving down the road and the joint
[1:46:41] my truck blew up and um that's not a
[1:46:43] good thing. And uh I I remember talking
[1:46:47] to brother Micah cuz he had just
[1:46:49] basically third pulled his truck back to
[1:46:52] working [laughter] and I made a joke on
[1:46:54] on Sunday night when we went to the um
[1:46:56] to the Yans, man, you got another one of
[1:46:57] those? I could really use one.
[1:46:59] [laughter]
[1:47:00] But uh anyways, I I I was thinking about
[1:47:02] it. I'm like, man, Lord, I really need
[1:47:04] this. What had happened is that when the
[1:47:05] the reason the U-jint failed is I'd had
[1:47:07] it repaired previously and the guys who
[1:47:09] had repaired it, who put the new U-jint
[1:47:10] in it for me, um had damaged it and then
[1:47:13] when they repaired it, the repair failed
[1:47:15] and so it just blew all the U-jint up
[1:47:16] and it was a I was going to have to get
[1:47:18] a new drive shaft is what the long and
[1:47:20] short of it was. And um I was thinking
[1:47:23] like, well, I could try to repair this
[1:47:24] and even if the Lord fixed that part,
[1:47:27] because in my mind I was like, man, if
[1:47:28] the Lord could just fix that part, I
[1:47:29] could get new U-jints. And I thought,
[1:47:32] well, even if you did that, I was still
[1:47:33] gonna have to pay a bunch of money to
[1:47:34] get all the U-jints put in it and new
[1:47:36] bearings and stuff. And um so I was
[1:47:39] like, well, I'm just gonna I'm just
[1:47:40] gonna order a new a new drive shaft and
[1:47:41] and move on. Well, I had ordered a drive
[1:47:45] shaft and then something said, "Hey, you
[1:47:46] need to double check because the the
[1:47:48] year that you ordered that for is
[1:47:49] wrong." And I I'd got it a year off. And
[1:47:52] so I canceled the order and when I got
[1:47:54] home and double checked it, I had
[1:47:56] ordered the right one. Like, well,
[1:47:57] that's weird. And when I went online to
[1:48:00] the to the online uh parts catalog, a
[1:48:03] new listing popped up for a refurbished
[1:48:07] drive shaft that's exactly the same
[1:48:09] drive shaft that I had with all the
[1:48:11] bearings and everything put in it. And
[1:48:12] the cost of it was exactly what the cost
[1:48:16] of having my old drive shaft get new
[1:48:18] bearings and stuff put in it. So, it
[1:48:20] ended up being exactly as if God had
[1:48:24] fixed my my original drive shaft. And it
[1:48:26] just meant a lot to me because it was it
[1:48:28] was uh I I you know it's
[1:48:33] it it saved me a lot of money and I can
[1:48:35] get my truck fixed and it it I don't
[1:48:37] know it just meant a lot to a lot to me
[1:48:39] and the the Lord kind of answered my
[1:48:40] prayer and get me getting me my my truck
[1:48:42] fixed.
[1:48:42] Amen.
[1:48:44] [applause]
[1:48:45] Lord,
[1:48:48] let's sing that. Let's sing that
[1:48:50] whatever you have on your heart, bro.
[1:48:53] God.
[1:48:55] God.
[1:48:56] Amen.
[1:48:58] Let's just sing one one line of this.
[1:49:00] God is so [music and singing]
[1:49:02] good.
[1:49:05] God
[1:49:07] is [music] so [singing] good.
[1:49:11] God
[1:49:13] is so [singing] good. [music]
[1:49:16] He is so good
