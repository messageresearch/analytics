[23:17] here we um we want to be
[23:20] remembering uh the Howell Family I'm
[23:22] sure you got the notice that went out
[23:25] sister Becky called me about 5:30 this
[23:28] morning I guess they just found
[23:30] out so they're sad but they're also
[23:33] stalwart they're also believing God that
[23:36] it is an answer to prayer that God saved
[23:39] their son and the only way he could
[23:42] sometimes because God won't Force you
[23:44] but if you're his child he'll just Paul
[23:46] taught that brother Brown taught that
[23:48] he'll just take you off the Earth Amen
[23:50] to save your soul according to St Paul
[23:54] and so uh sister Becky had actually went
[23:57] through a prayer line few years ago um
[24:00] brother Ronald Dean Spencer and the
[24:02] desire on her heart was to say this was
[24:05] what she said to brother Ron she said I
[24:07] I just want to be like Hattie Wright I
[24:10] want to have the assurance that my
[24:13] children I want to claim them and have
[24:15] the assurance that he's he that she had
[24:18] and she said brother Ron looked at her
[24:20] and said all right sister
[24:23] hady claim it and believe it don't you
[24:26] never back up from it and that's been
[24:28] her testimony so today even through the
[24:32] sadness and the tears and I talked to
[24:34] brother Joe and you could hear their
[24:35] hearts breaking as you can well
[24:38] imagine uh but yet they are rejoicing in
[24:41] the mercy of the Lord they firmly
[24:44] believe they will see that Wayward young
[24:46] man again amen praise the Lord sister uh
[24:51] Becky joins a small number of sisters
[24:54] here who have lost sons and uh who were
[24:57] wayward

[25:49] wonderful time at the youth Gathering uh
[25:52] Friday night I so appreciated all the
[25:55] participation and uh it was uh it was
[25:58] really really good the whole atmosphere
[26:00] we managed to teach a little bit a
[26:02] little bible study there gonna kind of
[26:05] for the young people who got to hear
[26:06] some of that uh Friday night it was
[26:09] really just a continuation of Wednesday
[26:11] night when we just came to a screeching
[26:14] halt and I I wanted to say a few more
[26:17] things I said it to them so we might
[26:19] young people we might recap not directly
[26:22] but I recap some of the general thought
[26:25] from Friday night and I want to go
[26:27] forward Today part nine of summing up
[26:30] the world near the end it is a very
[26:34] perilous age that we live in friends and
[26:39] I'm I'm glad to be able to tell you
[26:41] today that you are in a place where the
[26:44] supernatural power of God can come down
[26:47] and is obligated and has promised to
[26:50] meet your every need there's nothing
[26:53] nothing that's happening in the world
[26:55] with all the madness that we see that
[26:58] can overwhelm God's word so so you put
[27:01] your order in today will you you put
[27:03] your faith and say Lord I have needs in
[27:05] my life and I want to see the word how
[27:08] many I want to see the word come forward
[27:11] and put Supernatural strength in me
[27:14] because I'll promise you that it will do
[27:18] that it absolutely will I've seen that
[27:20] so many times over the years the word of
[27:23] God just come in with the perfect
[27:25] solution to everything you could need um
[27:30] St uh let's read from St John
[27:34] 15 amen this morning as we uh open our
[27:39] Bibles see
[27:42] here yes perfect okay we'll catch verse
[27:46] 1 to8 and we'll let you be
[27:50] seated I am the True Vine and my father
[27:54] is the husbandman so this makes him the
[27:56] farmer
[27:58] every branch in me that beareth not
[28:01] fruit he taketh away and every branch
[28:05] that beareth fruit he purgeth it that it
[28:09] may bring forth more fruit now ye are
[28:13] clean through the word that's an
[28:15] important verse in verse three you are
[28:17] clean through the word which I have
[28:19] spoken unto you abide in me and I in you
[28:24] as the branch cannot bear fruit of
[28:26] itself
[28:28] except it abide in the vine no more can
[28:31] ye except ye abide in me I am the vine
[28:36] you are the branches he that abideth in
[28:39] me and I in him the same bringeth forth
[28:43] much
[28:44] fruit Jesus seems to be
[28:47] really interested in you
[28:51] bearing Fair
[28:53] reading for without me you can do
[28:56] nothing verse verse six if a man abide
[28:59] not in me he's not letting it go see he
[29:02] didn't just want to say it he's not but
[29:04] he's not letting this go if a man abide
[29:06] not in me he's cast cast forth as a
[29:09] branch and is withered and Men gather
[29:12] them and cast them into the fire and
[29:15] they are burned if ye abide in me he's
[29:19] still he's pressing his case if you
[29:22] abide in me and my words abide in you
[29:26] you shall ask what you will and it shall
[29:29] be done to you now here's the real goal
[29:33] herein is my father glorified that you
[29:38] bear much fruit so shall you be my
[29:44] disciples he has quite an interest in
[29:47] bringing glory to the father by being
[29:50] able to live through you amen but the
[29:53] only way he can do that is if you're out
[29:56] of his way
[29:59] all right now I'm summing up the world
[30:02] at the end time I'm not only summing up
[30:04] Satan's Eden which we have done in
[30:06] previous lessons of this but we're
[30:09] really coming down to this point that
[30:13] God is designed to have this world see
[30:17] one last time a quick brother brandham
[30:20] said a powerful
[30:23] demonstration of the holy spirit amen
[30:28] so we know that we are living in that
[30:31] moment that he's Desiring to do it so if
[30:34] ever St John 15 was important I think we
[30:38] could could conclude it's important
[30:40] today and if you don't conclude that I
[30:42] hope you will by the time we're finished
[30:45] with the sermon today let's pray father
[30:47] we thank you for your word and we ask
[30:50] for your divine blessing Lord upon it
[30:53] now and I pray you to settle my heart
[30:56] and mind Lord as I read through these
[30:59] notes I have such a burning desire to to
[31:03] go through them carefully and to this
[31:07] may be the last portion in this series
[31:09] and I want to clench it and drive the
[31:13] nail till it till it clenches Lord so I
[31:16] pray that you'll be my helper I commit
[31:18] it to you give us all hearing Hearts
[31:20] today thank you for the preparation lord
[31:24] of the spirit of God upon me thank you
[31:27] for anointing me Lord in prayer and in
[31:29] study I commit myself into your hands
[31:32] now Lord we're remembering brother Joe
[31:35] sister Becky and all of the children a
[31:37] very sad uh loss Lord but but Father
[31:43] Paul told us Paul didn't say that that
[31:46] we don't sorrow it's just that we don't
[31:49] sorrow as the world Sorrows having no
[31:51] hope our hope is in Christ Our Hope is
[31:54] in the word our belief and our faith is
[31:57] in a token Lord that was applied to that
[32:00] young man father and so we are looking
[32:03] to you with confidence today as children
[32:05] would look to any father Lord with a
[32:08] great need on their heart I pray you'll
[32:10] Comfort them lift them up above the
[32:12] shadows of this sorrow Lord and be their
[32:15] comfort I pray help us to know Lord what
[32:18] we can do more for them they are part of
[32:21] our bethl family they always will be
[32:24] lord they're very special to us and so
[32:27] we're asking for a very special blessing
[32:30] upon them in jesus' name amen God bless
[32:34] you friends you can be
[32:55] seated all right so I I want to just
[32:57] take five or 10 minutes and just recap
[33:01] just
[33:02] quickly um I'm definitely not going to
[33:05] burn up my time doing it but I just want
[33:08] to make some quick points to you and
[33:12] then we are going to take some
[33:13] scriptures and some quotes and different
[33:16] things
[33:18] uh to stir you up by way of remembrance
[33:22] will that be okay amen I'm just looking
[33:25] to make sure that I'm all got all my
[33:27] ducks in a row here I don't think I do
[33:29] but that's
[33:31] okay amen praise the Lord let me see why
[33:35] I don't no I do praise God all right
[33:39] excellent
[33:42] okay let's have my title slide brother
[33:47] Noah
[33:48] amen so we
[33:51] are summing up the world near the end
[33:54] and I'm taking for a subtitled today his
[33:59] presence in our lives his presence in
[34:03] our lives we were saying to you
[34:08] Wednesday night when we read our reading
[34:12] of St John 15 how that Jesus in the
[34:16] early part of his
[34:18] ministry his message to his disciples as
[34:22] it related to his relationship with them
[34:25] was come and follow me uh but there came
[34:29] a point late in his ministry this is
[34:32] very late in his life by the time you
[34:34] get to St John 15 uh The Book of John
[34:38] doesn't go uh much further so this is
[34:41] coming near the end of his life he has
[34:44] another very gripping prayer in the 17th
[34:47] chapter and from there his life begins
[34:50] to wind up rapidly and so we were
[34:53] pointing out to you uh as did Andrew
[34:56] Murray that great Theologian from yester
[34:58] year that's the commentator I couldn't
[35:00] think of his name Wednesday night a
[35:03] wonderful servant of the Lord and he was
[35:05] making the point he was emphasizing that
[35:09] it's near the end of Jesus ministry that
[35:11] now his message is going to transition
[35:15] and to not just follow me but abide in
[35:19] me and I in you now that's going to
[35:22] become necessary and this is the point
[35:24] that I wasn't able to get to so much
[35:26] Wednesday but I was able to get it to
[35:28] the young people Friday is that the the
[35:31] reason that you would need to abide that
[35:34] he changes his message it's not so much
[35:36] that he changes it as that he increases
[35:39] it he amplifies it and so he's because
[35:43] now he's getting ready to leave and the
[35:46] Holy Ghost is getting ready to come and
[35:48] the disciples have had they're not yet
[35:50] born again but they've had the advantage
[35:53] of hanging out with Jesus they've been
[35:56] with him they've ate together slept
[35:58] together fished together preached
[36:01] together prayed together and so they've
[36:04] had his presence there with them
[36:08] externally uh although they didn't have
[36:10] the Holy Ghost upon them yet it was upon
[36:13] him and that was a strong influence
[36:15] don't ever underestimate the strong
[36:18] influence you can have by having by
[36:21] being in possession of the Holy Ghost
[36:23] and the influence you can have don't
[36:25] ever underestimate it it's very powerful
[36:28] and so what you want to do you say well
[36:31] how can I make my influence how can the
[36:35] Holy Ghost in me uh I'm going to ask a
[36:38] good question on your behalf how can I
[36:41] have the Holy Ghost In Me affecting
[36:45] people and not just affecting them but
[36:48] effecting change in their lives how can
[36:51] I have that like Jesus had it the answer
[36:55] is super simp simple Jesus said I do
[36:59] always that which pleases the
[37:02] father so Jesus had a life of prayer he
[37:07] had a life of intentional dedication
[37:10] could I suggest to you today to serve
[37:13] God on purpose could I suggest to you
[37:16] today to have spirituality on purpose
[37:20] can I suggest to you today to make your
[37:21] prayer life
[37:25] intentional then if you do that then
[37:28] your Holy Ghost will influence those
[37:31] around you who don't have the Holy Ghost
[37:35] like maybe your children who have been
[37:37] raised in the ways of the Lord who are
[37:40] being influenced by the Holy Spirit and
[37:43] the greatest service that you can give
[37:45] to them as parents the greatest service
[37:48] you can do as Grandparents the greatest
[37:51] thing you can do as a student in school
[37:54] is allow the Holy Spirit to to work
[37:58] through your experience to those around
[38:01] you so that they can be affected and
[38:06] effected abide in me so it's a it's
[38:10] further than just follow me because now
[38:13] near the end before leaving for heaven
[38:17] he's going to introduce this new phase
[38:20] to signify the need and the access to a
[38:25] deeper spiritual ual connection which is
[38:28] going to come on the day of Pentecost in
[38:30] the upper room you're with
[38:33] me all right so when we look at that we
[38:39] emphasize these two verses now you're
[38:42] clean through the word that's logos
[38:45] which I have spoken to you now you know
[38:49] I I didn't take the time but because
[38:51] we've studied it so much in St John 1:1
[38:54] you had that word logos in the beginning
[38:56] was the word that's logos the word the
[39:00] logos means the established word for
[39:02] those who haven't been here during the
[39:04] series it just means the established
[39:06] word but then Jesus would come down
[39:09] later that's in John 1 one but in John
[39:14] 663 he he has this all
[39:18] encompassing vital oh my how vital don't
[39:23] forget John
[39:25] 663 it is the spirit that quickeneth the
[39:29] flesh profiteth nothing Paul would say
[39:33] that if you live by the flesh you'll
[39:35] die if you live by your flesh you'll
[39:38] never produce for God even if you've
[39:41] been born again of the spirit even if
[39:43] you've had a holy ghost experience if
[39:45] you don't abide in him if you don't
[39:49] serve him with fervor and Zeal on
[39:54] purpose amen
[39:57] with
[39:58] intent I listen Paul said the same way
[40:03] that you served the devil at one time
[40:06] now take that Zeal and serve the
[40:08] Lord I I you know at one time we all had
[40:13] our conversation in the world and we
[40:14] love the world don't deny it because
[40:17] Paul has already identified it we just
[40:20] have to admit it and in that time you
[40:23] loved the world you loved the things of
[40:25] the world maybe you were taught
[40:27] different maybe you were you knew you
[40:29] shouldn't do it you didn't want to miss
[40:30] the Rapture you didn't want to go to
[40:32] hell but but the the problem was your
[40:35] inner man lusted after the things of the
[40:38] world even though you knew it was wrong
[40:40] you loved the devil I'm
[40:42] sorry but that's the Fallen nature you
[40:45] were born with even if you were raised
[40:46] in a good home taught to know better and
[40:48] desired even to do better hell is paved
[40:51] with good intentions the road to hell is
[40:55] paved with good intentions a lot of
[40:58] people had very good intentions this
[41:01] young man a Rich Young Ruler had very
[41:05] good intentions he wasn't coming to
[41:07] Jesus for a show he actually had served
[41:11] God by the law but knew he still was
[41:14] coming up short and he says to the
[41:16] master of Life what can I
[41:20] do and Jesus said give your
[41:23] all that's really all he had to do
[41:27] give your all Jesus beholding him loved
[41:29] him give your all don't hold back
[41:32] anything it's not just Jesus wasn't
[41:34] chasing his
[41:36] money Jesus wanted his heart it wasn't
[41:40] just give all your money and give to the
[41:43] poor Jesus was saying come take up your
[41:47] cross and follow me see so but he
[41:51] couldn't do that and so we he says here
[41:55] the flesh Prophet is nothing but the
[41:58] words see now that's Rema the words that
[42:01] I speak unto you they are spirit and
[42:04] they are life so you have the world
[42:07] believing in the logos just like you do
[42:11] you understand we give you the example
[42:13] of Isaiah coming to and Gabriel coming
[42:16] to Mary Isaiah's prophecy was the logos
[42:19] but when the angel spoke it to Mary
[42:22] you're it then then God came down and a
[42:26] Supernatural way and quickened her faith
[42:29] and she said be it unto me I don't see
[42:31] how seems impossible but I'm a believer
[42:34] of the word and that faith in God's word
[42:39] was was then then what happened to Mary
[42:42] she got
[42:44] pregnant she became the
[42:47] Rema the living Isaiah's prophecy was
[42:50] logos it was just words but Mary became
[42:54] that prophecy in a
[42:57] body she became the Living Word the Rema
[43:00] of the logos and that's why Jesus said
[43:04] it is the spirit that quickeneth the
[43:07] Rema that I speak unto you not just that
[43:09] you memorize Bible verses not just that
[43:13] you live by a code of conduct but you
[43:16] have surrendered your life to Christ you
[43:19] have been filled with his spirit and
[43:21] your life now is a constant quest to get
[43:24] you out of the way and put him in charge
[43:28] and you become the Living Word in the
[43:31] world say how important is that brother
[43:33] brandham said it's so important that
[43:36] it'll that one of these mornings it'll
[43:38] raise the dead for hundreds of
[43:41] years is this bride becoming the
[43:47] Rema it's not sufficient to quote and
[43:50] believe Malachi 4 it's not sufficient to
[43:54] quote Revelation 10 seven and even
[43:57] believe it you've got to and you say I
[43:59] even I read 8 to 11 John eating the book
[44:02] and I believe that too it's not
[44:04] sufficient to just say I believe it are
[44:06] you going to be
[44:08] it are you willing to be the
[44:12] word I'm going to tell you what it's
[44:15] wonderful here in this atmosphere today
[44:18] and it sounds tastes very sweet in your
[44:20] mouth to say it yes sir I'll do it we
[44:22] raise up our hands but don't you don't
[44:24] think it won't be bitterness down in
[44:26] your belly because you're going to have
[44:28] to fight the greatest battle ever fought
[44:30] you're going to have every Devil with
[44:31] his guns trained on you you make
[44:33] yourself a Target but I just say bring
[44:35] it because I'm going to be a
[44:38] believer that's it I've made up my mind
[44:41] I'm going to be a believer and if I'm
[44:44] going to be one I'm going to be a real
[44:48] one tell you make a mistake sure what do
[44:51] you do about it then what do you do get
[44:54] up then what do you do go forward
[44:56] I will never stop hallelujah how many
[45:00] are with me
[45:03] today so it's so important the words
[45:07] that I speak it the Rema the in other
[45:09] words the revealed word not just the
[45:13] logos all the Christian denominations
[45:15] have this but it's the spirit that
[45:18] quickeneth it's the spirit that giveth
[45:21] life it's the spirit that giveth
[45:24] Revelation amen
[45:27] am so it's the anointed word it's the
[45:30] revealed word it's the Living Word
[45:32] that's the same thing just in different
[45:34] phases God reveals the word he anoints
[45:37] you to believe it and then you become it
[45:40] easy to
[45:41] follow all right so now ye are clean
[45:46] through the word which I've spoken to
[45:48] you that's why there's there's a
[45:50] blessing in just reading this there's a
[45:52] blessing in just hearing it there's a
[45:53] blessing in obeying it even if you're
[45:54] not born again
[45:58] absolutely this will give you a much
[46:00] better life even if you never become a
[46:02] Christian if there were I've I've often
[46:04] said if there was no heaven and no
[46:06] Rapture I'd still live by this because
[46:07] it's a better life I've never hung over
[46:11] I had to keep all my money because I
[46:13] don't spend it on booze and fast living
[46:16] I have a good name and a
[46:18] reputation I have a bomb in Gilead that
[46:20] I can get healed by if I get sick I have
[46:23] a comforter and a friend why why I I it
[46:27] gives me it makes me an honorable man
[46:29] who would not want to live by this even
[46:32] if they weren't even if there was no
[46:34] Heaven see the blessings of God Jesus
[46:37] said blessed are the merciful they shall
[46:39] obtain Mercy amen blessed are the meek
[46:42] blessed are the poor in spirit all these
[46:43] different things you
[46:46] know there that's why in just as just
[46:49] something as simple human the right
[46:52] mental attitude towards the word of God
[46:55] you know we've told we've told this
[46:56] testimony for Years brother Lyn Gibbs
[46:59] who's gone on to be with the Lord he
[47:01] preached tithes and offerings so strong
[47:05] as part of the Christian experience and
[47:07] they asked brother brandom do you have
[47:09] to pay ties to go to heaven brother R
[47:11] said well I I can't say that he said but
[47:13] I can say this if you are a Christian
[47:15] you certainly will pay your tithes and
[47:17] offerings he said because that's what a
[47:19] Christian does CU God overpays you and
[47:22] he gives you his portion to see if
[47:24] you'll bring it back to him and if you
[47:26] put it in your gas tank or in a
[47:28] restaurant you took your wife out or you
[47:30] bought a new car you you did that with
[47:32] God's portion you didn't return it to
[47:33] him how in the world am I on that oh I
[47:37] know I was telling you a
[47:39] story brother Gibbs preached that so
[47:42] strong this is a true story he had
[47:45] attorneys High rolling attorneys in that
[47:47] area where he lived who weren't even
[47:50] Christians didn't even go to church but
[47:53] they sent him ties because they said
[47:55] pastor we started doing it and we see
[47:57] God blessing us and blessing us and
[47:59] blessing us and we ain't even
[48:01] Christians God keeps his word just with
[48:04] a mental agreement right right amen
[48:08] please can I move on thank
[48:10] you
[48:12] amen wow what was up with that
[48:17] anyway it so if you abide in me and my
[48:23] words abide in you shall ask what you
[48:27] will and it shall be done to you now I
[48:32] want to concentrate on that seventh
[48:34] verse if you become the Living Word this
[48:38] is my my this is what this is Brother
[48:40] Jason reading verse 7 if you abide in me
[48:44] and my words since I know what Rema now
[48:46] means abide in you you shall ask what
[48:49] you will in other words you'll be the
[48:50] one bringing forth fruit you'll ask what
[48:53] you will you'll be the one operating
[48:55] supernat power you'll be the one putting
[48:57] Devils under your feet who will do that
[48:59] the Believers who
[49:01] abide
[49:03] see if ye become the Living Word by a
[49:07] new birth and maintain a close spiritual
[49:11] relationship with me you shall ask what
[49:13] you will and it shall be done to you you
[49:16] get it yes is that clear amen NLT on the
[49:20] next verse when you produce much fruit
[49:23] you are my true disciples this brings
[49:26] great glory to my
[49:30] father amen so here's where we've been I
[49:34] want to quickly read these next few
[49:36] slides this is where this was part of
[49:39] the theme of this series brother
[49:42] brandham in Christ is revealed in his
[49:44] own word August of
[49:47] 1965 there's three manifestations now
[49:50] the next thing happens is when it's all
[49:53] gathered up into that one person Jesus
[49:56] Christ bride and B he's talking about
[49:58] the coming of the Lord the catching away
[50:00] amen how many believe are right
[50:02] there is when it's all gathered up into
[50:05] that one person Jesus Christ bride and
[50:07] body see I've been trying to get you to
[50:10] understand in this series that we can
[50:13] talk about summing up the world near the
[50:16] end but this is summing up the bride
[50:19] this is summing up Christ near the end I
[50:22] already know it's Satan's Eden I I
[50:25] already know that he's the God of this
[50:27] evil age I already know these things are
[50:31] are moving I already know there's
[50:32] Insanity everywhere on the streets but
[50:35] what about me and you is it our destiny
[50:38] just to tough it out here forever no
[50:41] we're leaving in an
[50:43] exodus we have a Third Exodus what is
[50:46] going to happen just before we leave the
[50:48] Earth thank you for asking I'm summing
[50:50] it up now the next thing happens is when
[50:53] it's all gathered up into that that one
[50:55] person Jesus Christ bride and body at
[50:59] the physical Return of the Lord Jesus
[51:01] making his three times when he was
[51:04] brought on Earth killed crucified raised
[51:07] up manifesting him himself in the form
[51:11] of his body which is his bride the woman
[51:13] you get it she is part of his body and
[51:16] the woman and man is just so close
[51:19] together till they're just almost they
[51:22] are the same they ought to be anyhow
[51:25] there they are see they just exactly
[51:30] manifest manifested the
[51:33] same she is part of him because she was
[51:37] taken out from him and the B bride today
[51:42] is taken out from the body of Christ
[51:44] which is acting and doing just exactly
[51:47] like he said it would do for this day
[51:50] the bride the queen king and the Queen
[51:55] all right you got that amen amen
[51:59] so so when we come back to it now Jesus
[52:04] introducing this new phrase not merely
[52:07] follow me but abide in me all right so I
[52:11] was want to give you a comparison of
[52:13] this for a moment I'm granting my
[52:16] starting line is that you've already had
[52:18] a new birth experience all right so
[52:21] you're following the Lord but there's a
[52:24] big difference difference between
[52:27] following and
[52:29] abiding because abiding following is
[52:33] standing in his presence as a follower
[52:36] this is
[52:38] surrender this is what your prayer life
[52:40] should be when the next time you're on
[52:43] your knees I want you to put this image
[52:46] in your mind I am bowing and I'm putting
[52:50] my head in his bosom and I'm saying Lord
[52:53] help me today I want to serve you more I
[52:57] want to be surrendered more I was
[52:58] praying that at 2:30 this morning Lord
[53:01] help me I want to surrender
[53:03] more oh I want to see the power of God
[53:06] move in your life move in your home move
[53:09] in your family I I'm I'm dedicated to it
[53:12] I'm committed to it oh but I I I can't
[53:14] do it alone bethl Tabernacle surrender
[53:18] surrender abide
[53:22] abide see there's a massive difference
[53:25] between between standing before God and
[53:31] kneeling not just men there's a massive
[53:34] difference between a sister standing
[53:36] with her hands up she's a follower of
[53:38] Christ there's a big difference between
[53:40] that and that come on sister there's a
[53:43] big difference let me appeal to you
[53:46] today this is the kind of lady you want
[53:48] to be on your knees head bowed saying
[53:51] Lord God make me more like you
[53:55] yeah Hallelujah you accept
[54:02] that I am
[54:04] more
[54:06] convinced I am more convinced listen to
[54:09] me bethl Tabernacle
[54:11] Ministry I am more
[54:14] convinced that a that that as the
[54:19] ministry
[54:21] emphasizes abiding in Christ as much as
[54:26] we emphasize forgiveness through his
[54:29] blood that I believe that Believers will
[54:33] produce more and more and more of his
[54:37] purity of his gifts of his life I'm not
[54:41] just up here with a sinner's sermon I'm
[54:44] not just here to tell you the blood of
[54:46] Jesus Christ forgives you I'm glad
[54:48] you're following him but are you abiding
[54:50] in him are you every day drawing closer
[54:54] amen oh let it be my brothers that we
[54:58] that we give equal time not just to the
[55:00] forgiveness and the blood of Christ but
[55:02] to the cleansing and to the changing
[55:04] power that it has and can have in our
[55:10] lives if you abide in me and my Rema
[55:14] abide in you you shall ask what you will
[55:18] and it shall be done to you so if you
[55:22] become as I said if you become the
[55:24] living word by a new birth and you
[55:28] maintain a close and maintain
[55:31] maintenance is such a word you maintain
[55:33] a close spiritual relationship with
[55:36] Christ then you're the one who will ask
[55:39] and God will hear by by bearing much
[55:43] fruit you will Jesus said you will
[55:48] glorify my father all right and that's
[55:51] the purpose that Jesus lived for to
[55:54] glorify the father and he says and when
[55:57] you glorify the father then ye are my
[56:02] disciples you're not just a believer
[56:05] you're not just a follower you're
[56:07] actually a disciple because the world
[56:10] God is getting Glory through your life
[56:13] by bearing fruit you will glorify the
[56:15] father all right so so I would say let
[56:18] us strive to bear as much fruit as
[56:22] possible
[56:23] am that that should at this point now
[56:27] the early part of this series I was
[56:29] really emphasizing and teaching you from
[56:31] the prophet's message that it is this
[56:33] bride she is the his body she's the
[56:36] continuation but my message now as we
[56:39] come to a close because we're coming to
[56:42] the close of the age and we're we're
[56:44] coming to the that last moment and my
[56:47] message is beginning to push in this
[56:49] direction that we want to be able to
[56:53] demonstrate that our commitment is to
[56:56] Christ alone and in that and in that
[56:59] commitment we we can make uh the Lord
[57:03] you know glorified I I just would say
[57:06] today are are you willing to make that
[57:09] commitment today to say Lord I don't
[57:11] just want to be a Christian I just want
[57:12] to be a believer but I want to I want
[57:15] you to help me today here's what I'll
[57:17] commit Lord you being my helper I will
[57:19] begin I see what the pastor's talking
[57:21] about I'm going to get on the road to
[57:24] being more committed and more Abiding
[57:27] and more surrendered come on bethl
[57:30] Tabernacle oh my there's nothing you'll
[57:33] do to release power in your home more
[57:35] than that and fact is Rema must be in
[57:38] play for the established word to live
[57:41] out to his disciples that was going to
[57:43] be a point that Jesus was making that is
[57:45] what I told you Wednesday was the real
[57:49] non-negotiable non-negotiable is not the
[57:52] Trinity the the well you know what I to
[57:56] to a degree it is the correct Trinity
[58:00] because the Bible says there's no other
[58:02] name given among men whereby they must
[58:04] be saved and brother brandham flatly
[58:07] says on tape near the end of his
[58:09] ministry there is no Redemption under
[58:11] those titles if you've been baptized you
[58:13] need to be baptized again if you got
[58:15] baptized wrong see so it becomes very
[58:18] important but the real
[58:20] non-negotiable is that you allow the
[58:22] Holy Spirit to bring you to life
[58:25] and then you you you you know you allow
[58:27] him to work in your life inspiration and
[58:30] anointing I want to turn a corner
[58:33] now inspiration and anointing from the
[58:36] spirit of
[58:37] God doesn't require a new
[58:41] birth in and of
[58:43] itself it struck
[58:46] balum and he
[58:48] prophesied
[58:49] correctly a star shall rise in Jacob
[58:53] when the three wise men came they were
[58:54] following that
[58:56] prophecy it struck Caiaphas and he
[58:59] prophesied concerning the sufferings of
[59:01] Christ and he prophesied accurately see
[59:04] it struck
[59:07] Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar stood and
[59:10] said I will say today there is no God
[59:13] but Daniel's God only the god of Israel
[59:16] is the true God and he and that was what
[59:19] God taught him you see so so it can
[59:22] strike false anointed ones brother
[59:24] bradam show that it's a false it's a
[59:26] true anointing at the end time striking
[59:29] a false vessel so I want to say again
[59:32] that inspiration and anointing from the
[59:34] spirit of God doesn't require a new
[59:37] birth but now I'm going to tell you
[59:38] something friends
[59:41] uh to to to be born
[59:45] again that is
[59:48] Rema that is Rema that is the word alive
[59:53] so so it it can strike that the
[59:56] anointing that brings Rema the
[1:00:00] inspiration that brings Rema those men
[1:00:02] didn't become the Living
[1:00:04] Word did they see so when it falls on a
[1:00:09] true child of God we see a very
[1:00:11] different outcome and a result and
[1:00:13] that's why when the inspiration of God
[1:00:16] when the anointing of God Came Upon the
[1:00:19] characters of God's family in the Old
[1:00:21] Testament the writers of the Old
[1:00:23] Testament even even even before the Holy
[1:00:26] Ghost was given that inspiration struck
[1:00:30] Abel and Abel brought a sacrifice
[1:00:33] correctly Abel became Rema and he wasn't
[1:00:36] he couldn't even be born again but he
[1:00:38] did become a manifestation of a
[1:00:40] revelation he did it see it happened to
[1:00:44] Abraham it happened to Moses it happened
[1:00:47] to David it happened to Isaiah it
[1:00:50] happened to John the Baptist so whenever
[1:00:53] it strikes a child of God it definitely
[1:00:55] has a different effect than when it
[1:00:58] strikes a non-child of God it crossed
[1:01:00] into the New Testament and struck
[1:01:03] Peter Peter stood there in in Matthew 16
[1:01:07] and he had a revelation said who do men
[1:01:09] say that I am you're the Christ son of
[1:01:10] the Living God he said Flesh and Blood
[1:01:12] didn't reveal that Peter My Father
[1:01:15] revealed it so Peter caught a revelation
[1:01:18] he wasn't even yet born
[1:01:20] again you understand the difference it
[1:01:23] struck the woman at the
[1:01:25] well uh brother bradam goes to St John
[1:01:30] 4 you know I I I can't confess that I've
[1:01:33] ever did a a thorough count but just in
[1:01:37] my experience of reading through the
[1:01:38] message all these many years I would say
[1:01:41] other than maybe Mark 16 and maybe
[1:01:43] Hebrews
[1:01:45] 13:8 John 4 the woman at the well
[1:01:48] brother Bram goes back to that more than
[1:01:51] any other scripture especially in the
[1:01:53] prayer line and people are coming up he
[1:01:55] says now here we have here's a woman and
[1:01:57] now we have a perfect scene of St John 4
[1:02:00] a woman approaches a conversation ensues
[1:02:03] woman bring me a drink you know the
[1:02:05] story and and they go on down to verse
[1:02:08] 23 and and she she she starts
[1:02:11] immediately turning religious you know
[1:02:13] we know that you know this is going to
[1:02:15] happen in Messiah when he comes and and
[1:02:17] and Jesus says the hour cometh and now
[1:02:20] is when the true
[1:02:23] worshippers so if there's true
[1:02:26] worshippers Jesus is talking about the
[1:02:29] time is and is coming in other words
[1:02:32] it's already in me and it's about to
[1:02:33] come in my kingdom you understand that
[1:02:37] the time he says and now is the hour
[1:02:41] cometh and now is it's coming when you
[1:02:45] will be like
[1:02:46] me that's the prophecy there's coming a
[1:02:49] time it already is in existence in me
[1:02:51] but it's coming in you and the true
[1:02:54] worshippers so if so if there's going to
[1:02:56] be true worshippers in the era of the
[1:02:59] Holy Ghost then there would also have to
[1:03:01] be false
[1:03:02] ones because you can't you can't have a
[1:03:05] counterfeit without a reel and you're
[1:03:07] not likely you're not going to have a
[1:03:09] reel without the devil counterfeiting it
[1:03:10] he's done it since the aons of of time
[1:03:13] of History he's always counterfeited
[1:03:16] what God does because he wants to be God
[1:03:19] he's always wanted to be Isaiah outed
[1:03:21] him for that even though Satan was
[1:03:23] pretty upset when that happened
[1:03:25] but Isaiah outed him publicly that that
[1:03:27] was the desire of his heart to be like
[1:03:29] God to conquer you you know something
[1:03:31] friends let me tell you let me give you
[1:03:33] some Insider
[1:03:35] Supernatural uh God's army military
[1:03:38] intelligence Satan wants your
[1:03:42] position he wants you out of it so he
[1:03:45] can take it I want to say to you don't
[1:03:48] let that happen teenagers don't let that
[1:03:53] happen you are entitled by that day on
[1:03:56] Calvary you are entitled as a child of
[1:03:59] God to stand in the steps of Christ to
[1:04:01] perform his Works don't let Satan Edge
[1:04:04] you out of your inheritance
[1:04:08] amen the true worshippers shall worship
[1:04:11] the father in spirit and in truth see
[1:04:14] the problem is Sister you know you're
[1:04:17] you're saying in this mountain or that
[1:04:19] mountain and we say in Jerusalem but I'm
[1:04:22] just telling you after a while it ain't
[1:04:24] going to matter where you live or where
[1:04:26] you worship only that you do only that
[1:04:30] you do it in Truth and in and in spirit
[1:04:32] that you're not a hypocrite about it
[1:04:35] because there are going to be those who
[1:04:37] in vain they worship me teaching for
[1:04:39] Doctrine the the Commandments of men and
[1:04:42] he says and God is a spirit and they
[1:04:44] that worship Him must worship Him in
[1:04:46] spirit and in truth the woman saith to
[1:04:48] him I know that Messiah cometh which is
[1:04:50] called Christ when he is come he will
[1:04:52] tell us all things Jesus Jesus saith
[1:04:54] unto her now catch this 26 and 27 Jesus
[1:04:58] saith unto her I that speak unto thee am
[1:05:02] he verse 27 I didn't put it up here on
[1:05:05] purpose and upon this catch those three
[1:05:08] words and upon this come his disciples
[1:05:11] and marveled that he talked with the
[1:05:14] woman yet no man said what seekest thou
[1:05:17] or why talkest thou with her and verse
[1:05:21] 28 the woman then left her water pot and
[1:05:24] went her way into the City and saith
[1:05:27] unto all the men come see a man you know
[1:05:29] the story who told me the things that
[1:05:31] I've done so the woman at the well in St
[1:05:35] John 4:26 and 27 in which he's going to
[1:05:40] say and upon this at a at which time
[1:05:44] when it when when it says and upon this
[1:05:47] at that time two things happened in
[1:05:51] Rapid succession number one the first
[1:05:54] thing that happened was the disciples uh
[1:05:57] returned but all voices were silent and
[1:06:00] I'm here to tell you something friends
[1:06:01] it is in my experience that when this
[1:06:04] kind of Supernatural Revelation is
[1:06:06] breaking I'm here to tell you all other
[1:06:09] voices are silent you don't hear any
[1:06:12] other thing the devil can just talk and
[1:06:15] talk and talk and everybody can try to
[1:06:16] dissuade you and move you but when God
[1:06:19] is pouring out his Revelation Upon a
[1:06:22] Child of God every body falls
[1:06:25] silent I didn't say Speak Lord Speak
[1:06:29] Lord and I will
[1:06:31] listen the second thing is the effect
[1:06:34] that it brings for we see the woman
[1:06:36] leave her water pots and run with the
[1:06:39] testimony in other words we see the
[1:06:41] woman leave all other Pursuits behind
[1:06:45] with all of her former Pursuits and all
[1:06:48] of her former purposes I'm here to tell
[1:06:50] you it doesn't matter what you have
[1:06:52] invested in your life you may you may
[1:06:54] have invested in a career an education
[1:06:57] you may be in the middle of it right now
[1:06:59] but when you come into the presence of
[1:07:01] Jesus and he begins to reveal himself to
[1:07:04] you suddenly all other Pursuits she
[1:07:06] dropped her water pots she didn't care
[1:07:08] about that anymore she didn't care about
[1:07:10] her past she didn't care about her bad
[1:07:13] name she ran into the City and the Bible
[1:07:16] says she converted the whole
[1:07:19] village this is the power of Revelation
[1:07:24] amen and it all because that she had a
[1:07:27] gene of God but also she was willing to
[1:07:31] engage with Christ are you willing today
[1:07:36] are you willing to take some
[1:07:38] time set aside to engage with the
[1:07:43] Lord I'll assure you friends say well
[1:07:46] brother brother Jason she wasn't even
[1:07:48] yet born again I'll assure you that this
[1:07:51] experience at the well led her to the
[1:07:52] upper room I'll promise you she was
[1:07:55] among those
[1:07:56] 120 oh yes sir and brother brandham
[1:07:59] showed she's a she's literally a type of
[1:08:01] this bride in the last age because if
[1:08:03] there was ever an age where we come out
[1:08:06] of the worst possible condition I mean
[1:08:08] if you raised in a good home you have a
[1:08:11] great Advantage but many of us weren't
[1:08:13] and many of us were and still went out
[1:08:15] into the gutters of the world but oh God
[1:08:18] is rich in Mercy and Jesus said I must
[1:08:22] needs go by Samaria I'm glad one day he
[1:08:24] said I must go I must needs go by Newton
[1:08:26] North Carolina I got a young man who's
[1:08:29] not giving his whole heart to me and
[1:08:31] when he found me and I found him oh it
[1:08:34] was such a privilege to give my whole
[1:08:36] heart to
[1:08:38] him see so the result so it it's it's
[1:08:43] the the new birth I want to say this
[1:08:45] very
[1:08:46] carefully so the New Birth by the Holy
[1:08:49] Ghost uh that isn't necessary for this
[1:08:54] phenomenon of the anointing to fall upon
[1:08:57] you it's not for God's inspiration to
[1:09:00] fall upon you uh nor nor is it as I
[1:09:04] proved to you it's not even necessary
[1:09:05] that you have a gene of God but the
[1:09:08] result will be different if there's a
[1:09:11] gene of God the result will be different
[1:09:15] if it's a child of God moreover it takes
[1:09:17] the quickening I'm here to tell you
[1:09:19] something it it takes the quickening of
[1:09:21] the spirit it takes the revelation of
[1:09:23] the word word upon our heart to bring
[1:09:25] anyone to the new birth to bring you to
[1:09:28] the Living Word takes the baptism of the
[1:09:31] holy
[1:09:32] spirit this is why brother brandham
[1:09:34] would say when they ask him what is the
[1:09:36] new birth brother brandham and he would
[1:09:38] say it is the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:09:41] who is the word right it it is the
[1:09:46] revelation of Jesus Christ personally to
[1:09:49] you and brother brandham says right
[1:09:52] behind his own statement amen
[1:09:55] amen I'm going to tell you something
[1:09:56] that's a that's a double something when
[1:10:00] a prophet makes a statement and says
[1:10:02] Amen to his own statement I'm here to
[1:10:04] tell you say why amen I believe it's
[1:10:06] because that this life produces an amen
[1:10:09] in the voice of your life I don't
[1:10:12] believe you can come to a revelation of
[1:10:14] God and stay the way you are it's
[1:10:15] impossible it changes Paul said all
[1:10:18] things are are all old things are gone
[1:10:21] and All Things become new amen the
[1:10:24] worshipper once purged has no more
[1:10:27] conscience of sin brother brandom says
[1:10:29] all desires of the world are gone from
[1:10:32] him see then he's all he's got to do
[1:10:34] then is contend with his flesh and
[1:10:37] that's where abiding comes
[1:10:39] in you can't redeem yourself but it's up
[1:10:44] to you but it's up the Bible says the
[1:10:46] bride hath made herself ready see it's
[1:10:50] up to you to
[1:10:51] abide in him to bring forth fruit so
[1:10:57] this this this anointing this revelation
[1:11:01] of the word creates Rema in you it makes
[1:11:06] an amen in the voice of your lived life
[1:11:08] the the gene seed which is also the
[1:11:12] word that's why brother Ram said two
[1:11:14] omnipotence met it's the word meeting
[1:11:16] the word see this is why you say Amen to
[1:11:19] the word because you can't say otherwise
[1:11:22] am
[1:11:24] I I had no choice but to fall in love
[1:11:27] with sister
[1:11:30] Debbie say you could have ran I
[1:11:33] tried I didn't get
[1:11:35] far then she played hard to get and kna
[1:11:38] killed
[1:11:39] me amen I had to come back crawling on
[1:11:42] hands and
[1:11:44] knees oh I didn't know she'd already
[1:11:47] captured my heart and I tried to run off
[1:11:49] without it and realized I didn't have it
[1:11:51] anymore but that's the way it is with
[1:11:55] Christ it makes the
[1:11:58] word a perpetual and continual Rema in
[1:12:03] your
[1:12:04] life all right is this all making sense
[1:12:06] to you so a life renewed
[1:12:10] daily by time spent with the Lord in
[1:12:14] prayer I'm I'm clicking along just stay
[1:12:16] right with
[1:12:18] me it's an entering into a partnership
[1:12:21] with Christ to influence the world
[1:12:25] around you it's a it's a faith and and a
[1:12:28] reality that that comes down from heaven
[1:12:32] it brings down a supernatural power into
[1:12:35] the world your dedicated life your
[1:12:38] prayer life your commitment your abiding
[1:12:41] makes you a conduit it brings down the
[1:12:44] supernatural power of God to move in the
[1:12:47] earth you understand when Jesus was here
[1:12:50] physically the supernatural power of God
[1:12:53] moved moved in the earth well he's in
[1:12:55] heaven now so now he comes into the
[1:12:57] Earth through his family and now you are
[1:13:00] a projector of the supernatural power of
[1:13:03] God see to bring to do what to bring
[1:13:06] glory to the father so this is why Jesus
[1:13:09] would say herein is my father glorified
[1:13:12] that you bear much fruit and the and so
[1:13:15] shall you be my disciples so when you're
[1:13:18] his disciple when you're bearing forth
[1:13:20] fruit then I'm here to tell you that
[1:13:22] gives you the power
[1:13:23] to walk into any situation doesn't
[1:13:26] matter you are a conquering force in any
[1:13:29] situation the Lord lead you into you
[1:13:33] accept that today you you you you're
[1:13:35] you're the one who can walk into any
[1:13:37] situation and take every Spirit under
[1:13:40] your control for the glory of God you're
[1:13:43] the one who can apply a token over a
[1:13:46] home and because you say it God honors
[1:13:48] it and it sticks Hallelujah that's
[1:13:52] paying big dividends to brother Joe and
[1:13:54] sister Becky today because they signed
[1:13:57] and sealed it with the name of the Lord
[1:14:00] Jesus Christ this kind of power will
[1:14:02] will bring order out of disorder it'll
[1:14:05] turn chaos into Beauty I don't care
[1:14:08] what's happened it'll beautify your
[1:14:12] life it'll cast out Devils it'll heal
[1:14:15] the sick it'll raise the dead we've seen
[1:14:18] it happen amen it's a living word that's
[1:14:21] brought to life by an experience of the
[1:14:24] Holy Ghost that Living Word listen
[1:14:26] friends it's that Living
[1:14:28] Word that can never
[1:14:31] die or face the
[1:14:34] Judgment it's passed from Death to
[1:14:38] eternal life that eternal life is
[1:14:41] alive in you and it's it's it's it's
[1:14:46] alive in you and it what it's really
[1:14:49] doing is
[1:14:51] daily that part of you is already in
[1:14:53] Heavenly places with Christ it's trying
[1:14:56] to get your body
[1:14:58] there it's it's not just trying to get
[1:15:00] your soul there now it's working on
[1:15:02] getting this flesh there Hallelujah
[1:15:07] abide in me as you can do nothing unless
[1:15:10] you abide in
[1:15:13] me so I'm believing that and as I said
[1:15:16] to the ministry I'm more convinced that
[1:15:18] this is an emphasis that we must make I
[1:15:21] believe it'll bring more faith I believe
[1:15:23] it'll bring more Resolve I believe it'll
[1:15:25] bring more power I you know it would
[1:15:28] produce power over evil in your life how
[1:15:32] many want that the power of God would
[1:15:35] move through you constantly it would be
[1:15:38] listen friends it would be out of that
[1:15:40] kind of life that the Redemptive
[1:15:42] blessings
[1:15:44] flow that's why Jesus is emphasizing it
[1:15:47] abide in me so that you can be fruitful
[1:15:51] so that you can bring your fruit
[1:15:53] fruitfulness will bring glory to God
[1:15:55] you've got the Holy Ghost is coming I'm
[1:15:57] leaving a little while the world won't
[1:16:00] see me but you'll see me it's a secret
[1:16:02] you don't understand it now but you will
[1:16:05] I'm going to be with you even in you and
[1:16:07] the life you see in me is going to be in
[1:16:09] you and the ministry of seeing me is
[1:16:11] going to be in you if you want to
[1:16:13] operate it like you see me operate then
[1:16:15] live like I
[1:16:16] live spend time in prayer spend time
[1:16:19] with the Lord dedicate yourself uh hide
[1:16:24] in that
[1:16:25] presence because it's out of that kind
[1:16:28] of life that the Redemptive blessings of
[1:16:30] Calvary all the blessings that Calvary
[1:16:32] purchased and everything that the Holy
[1:16:35] Ghost sealed in you oh I'm here to tell
[1:16:38] you something friends out of that life
[1:16:40] would flow all the fruits of the spirit
[1:16:41] you believe
[1:16:43] me it would give you power over your
[1:16:45] tongue and your temper would give you
[1:16:47] power over your flesh it would give you
[1:16:49] power I'm preaching about real power to
[1:16:52] live and over overcoming life to stop
[1:16:55] getting drug around by the devil you
[1:16:57] don't have to do that young people you
[1:16:59] can be full of the power of almighty God
[1:17:03] Hallelujah by accepting Jesus in
[1:17:06] faith uh Andrew Murray said this by
[1:17:10] accepting Jesus in faith as he offers
[1:17:13] himself to us he and his word we
[1:17:18] surrender ourselves completely to him to
[1:17:22] his every word so in in other words by
[1:17:25] accepting him in in the way he
[1:17:28] offers and the way he's offering it to
[1:17:31] you is through a surrendered life so
[1:17:34] you're not going to cheat
[1:17:36] him you're not just going to walk up and
[1:17:38] say I need some power over Devils so I
[1:17:41] Lord I believe the
[1:17:42] message well but what has it done in
[1:17:45] your life what have you allowed you
[1:17:47] think I'm going to you think I have the
[1:17:50] the low God would be saying to you you
[1:17:51] think I have the low character to give
[1:17:54] Heavenly power to you and you don't even
[1:17:56] have enough Zeal to spend an hour with
[1:18:00] me in
[1:18:01] prayer God would never the the the the
[1:18:05] tutor would never give that that kind of
[1:18:08] power out God's got too much character
[1:18:10] he knows that power apart from character
[1:18:12] is satanic doesn't mean you're the devil
[1:18:14] but it means Satan can get a hold of
[1:18:16] your life and use the power of God
[1:18:19] wrongly all right let me quickly move on
[1:18:23] I think I'm going to make it
[1:18:24] today a seed is not air with a Shug now
[1:18:27] we see that there are three in the
[1:18:30] Perfection God is perfected in threes
[1:18:33] now and that was in the Perfection of
[1:18:37] the Seed of Abraham was ishmail and
[1:18:40] Isaac and Jesus he's perfected in threes
[1:18:43] ishmail Isaac and Jesus ishmail coming
[1:18:47] from the Bond woman see Isaac coming
[1:18:52] from the free woman and both of them
[1:18:56] with sex but Christ Jesus coming from
[1:19:00] the Virgin with no sex amen see now
[1:19:05] that's how the church starts that's how
[1:19:07] it always starts and here we find the
[1:19:11] beginning of the promise of God being
[1:19:14] made manifest through a slightly doubted
[1:19:17] interrupted program of God so first of
[1:19:22] all Sarah slightly doubted the word and
[1:19:25] said to Abraham take take Hagar which
[1:19:29] they picked up Hagar in Egypt the Bible
[1:19:31] teaches us that brother Bram said that
[1:19:32] on tape that they picked up Hagar in
[1:19:35] Egypt and and and why were they in Egypt
[1:19:39] because Abraham was
[1:19:41] backslid he ran for it when when life
[1:19:44] got a little hard in the promised land
[1:19:47] oh come on Friends listen the Bible the
[1:19:49] Bible doesn't say Abraham never stumbled
[1:19:52] Bible says Abraham never stumbled at the
[1:19:55] promise I'm so glad of that cuz I've
[1:19:57] stumbled all kinds of times but I've
[1:19:59] never stumbled at the
[1:20:01] [Applause]
[1:20:03] promise and just like the Lord brought
[1:20:05] Abraham out and nearly nearly cost him
[1:20:07] everything he had and it gets Hagar and
[1:20:10] and I've said to this Israel is to this
[1:20:12] day paying for that because that brought
[1:20:14] forth ishmail and it brought forth a
[1:20:16] wild man and they're untamable and
[1:20:19] Israel's had to fight them ever since so
[1:20:21] don't do that you don't have to do it
[1:20:24] that's a word slightly doubted see and
[1:20:27] so you say all right so but but then
[1:20:30] Sarah was the right womb so now it's
[1:20:35] Abraham first it was the right seed in
[1:20:37] the wrong womb now it's the right seed
[1:20:40] in the right womb but it's still coming
[1:20:41] by sex so it's still not the not the not
[1:20:45] the Genesis it's not the
[1:20:47] original understand that started in Eve
[1:20:50] and so so we find out that that that
[1:20:53] Jesus comes perfect God is perfected he
[1:20:58] was perfected it does matter that the
[1:21:00] and brother R says that's what the
[1:21:02] church does it always starts that's how
[1:21:05] it always starts and here we find on
[1:21:07] what a promise slightly
[1:21:10] doubted oh I know the Bible says that
[1:21:13] but I don't think it means that to for
[1:21:14] me in this hour I know what it says
[1:21:17] about women you know in the Old
[1:21:18] Testament uh you know not wearing a
[1:21:20] garment that pertains to a man but
[1:21:22] that's the old Testament I know Paul
[1:21:23] said that a woman shouldn't cut her hair
[1:21:25] but that's Paul he was just an old woman
[1:21:27] hater and and and and that's the that's
[1:21:29] take but I believe in Jesus that's
[1:21:32] taking the word and trying to make it
[1:21:35] live when you're doubting the promise
[1:21:37] you got to take all the word see and so
[1:21:42] here we find the beginning of the
[1:21:44] promise of God being made manifest
[1:21:46] through a slightly doubted interrupted
[1:21:48] program of
[1:21:50] God and here's Sarah
[1:21:53] even to who the promise Sarah being a
[1:21:55] woman which is a type of the church gave
[1:21:59] doubt to the original program of God's
[1:22:01] promised word see just bypassing one
[1:22:05] little Iota changed the whole program
[1:22:09] this is this is exactly why the church
[1:22:12] even the true church we're not talking
[1:22:13] about the bride we're talking about the
[1:22:14] foolish virgin the remnant of the
[1:22:17] woman's seed this is why they missed the
[1:22:19] Rapture cuz they don't accept all the
[1:22:22] word of God they do accept Christ but
[1:22:25] it's a promise slightly doubted and
[1:22:28] because they don't and because of that
[1:22:29] they don't receive the new birth because
[1:22:31] there's no way to receive the new birth
[1:22:32] doubting any promise of God is there's
[1:22:35] no way no person in the Bible has ever
[1:22:39] found right standing in the presence of
[1:22:42] God with denying any part of his word
[1:22:46] now maybe it the whole thing wasn't
[1:22:48] revealed to them but whatever was
[1:22:50] revealed they accepted it in the ages
[1:22:53] they didn't have the full word but what
[1:22:54] they had they accepted it and that was
[1:22:57] enough to get them in the first
[1:22:58] resurrection don't brother Ram said
[1:23:00] don't say Luther didn't have the Holy
[1:23:01] Ghost he did don't say it was wasn't
[1:23:03] borning and he was even though he didn't
[1:23:05] have the whole word because you can't
[1:23:06] disbelieve what you don't know but when
[1:23:08] you can see it and God makes it plain
[1:23:10] you if you want to be born again you
[1:23:13] have to agree to it and let your life
[1:23:16] die out and come as a new a new creation
[1:23:20] am see so so he
[1:23:25] says um
[1:23:28] therefore we've got to take every word
[1:23:30] of God as thus sayith the Lord every
[1:23:35] word of God is
[1:23:39] true oops last one Church natural Church
[1:23:45] spiritual there is a church natural but
[1:23:49] these women here type and there's a
[1:23:51] church spiritual also so the natural
[1:23:54] church and the spiritual church cannot
[1:23:57] be hirs together they are twoo different
[1:24:00] separate times two different separate
[1:24:03] peoples under two different separate
[1:24:07] covenants so the church is is under the
[1:24:11] Lamb's Book the church is Under The Book
[1:24:14] of Life the bride is found in the LA the
[1:24:17] section of election in the Lamb's Book
[1:24:19] of Life that special section
[1:24:22] of election all right
[1:24:25] now so when we when we see this coming
[1:24:30] forth you know Paul says in Hebrews 121
[1:24:35] wherefore seeing we also are compassed
[1:24:40] with so great a cloud of witnesses see
[1:24:43] and I'm here to tell you something
[1:24:44] friends they're ready to be back Among
[1:24:47] Us I feel it the depths of my soul I
[1:24:51] believe that the world is is wrapping up
[1:24:53] and soon we'll be in glory oh this is a
[1:24:55] time to make your calling and election
[1:24:57] sure this is a time to check up this is
[1:24:59] a time to make sure the token not that
[1:25:01] you just have it but you have it on
[1:25:05] display that's the only thing the devil
[1:25:07] fears so you know so when so when
[1:25:10] brother brandham has given us those
[1:25:13] quotes that it's the queen it's the king
[1:25:15] and the queen that we read then then
[1:25:18] what will we do what is Our obligation I
[1:25:21] just said
[1:25:22] with Paul lay aside every weight and the
[1:25:26] sin which doth so easily beset us and
[1:25:29] let us run with patience the race that
[1:25:32] is set before us how many will accept
[1:25:35] that say what sh what should we do St
[1:25:38] Paul and Paul would say purge yourself
[1:25:41] from ungodliness cast down vain
[1:25:44] imaginations flee youthful lust follow
[1:25:48] after
[1:25:51] righteousness
[1:25:52] it's then it's
[1:25:54] then it's
[1:25:57] then that the holy spirit will do the
[1:26:00] supernatural work of making the word to
[1:26:04] be spirit and life in your life amen
[1:26:09] that's the secret to fulfilling John
[1:26:13] 663 see the words that I give to you as
[1:26:17] Jesus said in St John 15 are
[1:26:21] logos but he comes right down in the
[1:26:23] seventh verse and now it's beginning to
[1:26:25] be something more than just the
[1:26:27] established word he's calling for you to
[1:26:30] become the
[1:26:32] word that's what I
[1:26:35] want his Spirit his life living within
[1:26:41] my life I want me out of the
[1:26:44] way oh God I want me out of the
[1:26:48] way oh I want to abide in him I'm I'm
[1:26:52] I'm wrapping up you still with me I want
[1:26:54] to finish can I do
[1:26:55] it I just need maybe 10 more minutes 15
[1:26:59] at the most I'm sure I can see I can see
[1:27:01] the
[1:27:01] end we've talked a lot about Mary being
[1:27:04] the
[1:27:05] Prototype because remember it was
[1:27:07] ishmail I'm sorry it was Hagar then it
[1:27:11] was Sarah then brother brandham when he
[1:27:13] goes on to type it he gives the type
[1:27:16] that it's it's actually the bride it's
[1:27:19] you and I see who come by the ver virgin
[1:27:22] born word of God see and so so an Mary
[1:27:27] is actually the example for us to
[1:27:29] believe so the revelation of the word
[1:27:33] and our deep surrender to Christ right
[1:27:36] here at the Finish Line oh I wish I had
[1:27:38] a megaphone to the world right here at
[1:27:41] the Finish Line This is what is going to
[1:27:44] make us the Living Word that God can
[1:27:47] work through it's up to you friends or
[1:27:50] you want to be the Living Word word that
[1:27:52] God can work
[1:27:54] through you say yeah but but brother
[1:27:57] Jason Mary was highly
[1:27:59] favored what's the meaning of
[1:28:01] Grace the
[1:28:04] unmar
[1:28:06] favor she she's a type of you she
[1:28:10] couldn't produce that neither can you
[1:28:12] but she could believe it so can you God
[1:28:15] made it her into it he will you too
[1:28:19] Hallelujah you say oh I I I wish was
[1:28:22] there with Mary you are you are with
[1:28:25] Mary right now you're with
[1:28:28] Mary oh friends Mary being highly
[1:28:32] favored that was just a prototype for us
[1:28:36] because she could believe the impossible
[1:28:38] and I'm going to tell you something
[1:28:38] inspiration comes to the
[1:28:41] inspirable absolutely does so it's the
[1:28:44] Lamb's Book of his elected family see
[1:28:48] that's the one God is dealing with
[1:28:49] through the through the origin people
[1:28:52] people whose origin is from the word the
[1:28:56] the the same word that was with God and
[1:28:59] was God and then the next verse says the
[1:29:02] same was in the beginning with God it's
[1:29:05] not another Jesus it's a family brother
[1:29:09] brandham said when God said let us make
[1:29:12] man in our image he made his whole
[1:29:14] family you were right there in Genesis
[1:29:17] friends you were part of the word Jesus
[1:29:21] was the word you are in Christ he's the
[1:29:24] elected son I'm in Christ I came from
[1:29:29] him see so it's all the family of God
[1:29:32] whose origin was in Jesus at the
[1:29:34] beginning you know it's interesting
[1:29:36] because Scholars who are critics by the
[1:29:39] way generally speaking uh and I'm
[1:29:42] particularly talking about
[1:29:45] critics they
[1:29:48] claim they actually claim to be
[1:29:50] Christians but they actually claim claim
[1:29:52] that Jesus wasn't even
[1:29:54] Divine they claim that actually the real
[1:29:58] critics they claim that you know he
[1:30:01] brother B talks about how you know they
[1:30:02] said oh he just drank mandre weed and he
[1:30:05] didn't really die it was all a fake
[1:30:07] death remember that and they they teach
[1:30:09] that to this day it was all a fake death
[1:30:12] no he was just a man and that's
[1:30:14] gnosticism he was just a man and he in
[1:30:18] fact is after his fake death and then
[1:30:20] his fake Resurrection
[1:30:22] then
[1:30:23] he moved off to India and went up into
[1:30:27] India and you know married an Indian
[1:30:29] wife and settled down and had a family
[1:30:32] and raised children and died in
[1:30:35] obscurity that's what they actually
[1:30:38] believe now don't throw a RI a rock at
[1:30:41] me but you know they're they're right to
[1:30:43] a
[1:30:44] point he did go to India but not not in
[1:30:48] his body he went in the body of
[1:30:50] Thomas amen and he did have an Indian
[1:30:55] wife and he's still birthing wives in
[1:30:58] India today
[1:31:00] Hallelujah
[1:31:02] see it wasn't Jesus that died it was
[1:31:05] Thomas that died but Christ went into
[1:31:09] India in Thomas and he birthed an Indian
[1:31:12] nation of the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:31:15] Hallelujah and he's still doing it
[1:31:18] today oh my friends I'm tell you they're
[1:31:21] scattered all around the world he's got
[1:31:23] disciples the lightning that started in
[1:31:25] the East has traveled to the west and we
[1:31:27] are observing it
[1:31:29] today I don't care what the critics say
[1:31:31] he lives I know he lives he lives in
[1:31:34] me oh my that same Jesus is alive today
[1:31:38] here he is in the furthest west amen I
[1:31:42] believe
[1:31:43] it we found out in our study that as
[1:31:46] brother brandham said there's another
[1:31:48] you I thought about that interestingly
[1:31:49] in a way that never occurred to me
[1:31:51] before for and it was almost amusing and
[1:31:54] I don't have a quote for it so you can
[1:31:56] throw it out if you want to but brother
[1:31:58] brandham said you know I found out
[1:31:59] there's another me he said there was
[1:32:02] another William brandham down in me now
[1:32:05] here's what we do know by the teaching
[1:32:06] of the word that the there's a one me
[1:32:09] that fails constantly there's another me
[1:32:11] that never
[1:32:12] does hallelujah and it's that other me
[1:32:16] that's got this me on a journey to a
[1:32:18] change yes oh Hallelujah there's another
[1:32:22] you oh I know you have mistakes but
[1:32:25] there's another you there's another you
[1:32:27] there's another one that doesn't
[1:32:30] disbelieve God's word and I thought to
[1:32:31] myself gee he's still sending them out
[1:32:34] two by
[1:32:35] two thought he sending them out two by
[1:32:38] two if if I'm not with anybody I'm with
[1:32:41] this old flesh but this ain't the real
[1:32:43] me Hallelujah there's another me that
[1:32:46] never doubts his word and always is an
[1:32:50] overcomer oh my brother brandham says
[1:32:52] here finally I got two slides
[1:32:55] left he says the Dynamics this is very
[1:32:58] familiar we read it a lot the Dynamics
[1:33:00] of this church will be a refilling of
[1:33:02] the holy spirit that we have worked in a
[1:33:05] small measure while The Headstone is
[1:33:07] coming down to unite with the body but
[1:33:10] when that head and body unites together
[1:33:12] the full power of the Holy Ghost would
[1:33:15] raise her up just exactly like that even
[1:33:19] the dead that's dead in Christ for
[1:33:21] hundreds of years ago will rise in the
[1:33:24] beauty friends we're so close to that
[1:33:26] rise in the beauty of his Holiness and
[1:33:29] take a flight to the skies and now and
[1:33:32] then look what he says in this next one
[1:33:33] now the Dynamics of this great regime
[1:33:36] that they got built this big machine
[1:33:38] will work someday in the united Council
[1:33:42] of of the World Council of churches
[1:33:45] which will make a forcing see so so I
[1:33:49] can say to you today that that sure is
[1:33:52] moving at a pace then why would I not be
[1:33:56] so well I don't feel like him I don't
[1:33:58] care how you feel there's another you
[1:34:00] hallelujah it's not about this old man
[1:34:04] Hallelujah this world this body is not
[1:34:06] my home I got a Heavenly Body
[1:34:09] waiting Oh Glory to God friends this is
[1:34:12] exactly why that when the word of God
[1:34:16] when when the word of God comes to us
[1:34:17] it's a revelation of Jesus Christ to you
[1:34:20] personally can you witness that today
[1:34:23] say I can't even always explain it but I
[1:34:25] know whom I have
[1:34:28] believed you're going to need that kind
[1:34:31] of experience friends the deception is
[1:34:34] too great let me let me leave you with
[1:34:36] this as I go off the air you're going to
[1:34:39] need it yeah the deception that you face
[1:34:43] and that your children face is
[1:34:47] dire Jesus said there shall arise false
[1:34:50] Christ and false
[1:34:52] prophets they shall show great signs and
[1:34:55] wonders in so much that if it were
[1:34:57] possible they shall deceive the very
[1:35:00] elect a
[1:35:02] people so
[1:35:05] hypnotized by that Beast
[1:35:08] system that they're literally moving in
[1:35:11] concert with the
[1:35:13] ideology of the Beast himself as brother
[1:35:16] ma Matthew Watkins preached some time
[1:35:18] ago that's why it it's it's astonishing
[1:35:21] to us how can people read about the
[1:35:24] tribulation in this book and read what
[1:35:26] it does and read about the the false
[1:35:28] prophet and read about the Antichrist
[1:35:30] and how that he'll take over the world
[1:35:31] and the people will and how that the
[1:35:33] description is so clear how would they
[1:35:35] do it who in their right mind would do
[1:35:36] it that's just it they won't be in the
[1:35:38] right
[1:35:39] mind the very things that they're
[1:35:42] feeding off of right now yeah in
[1:35:46] Hollywood in social media in
[1:35:49] professional sports I'm here to tell you
[1:35:51] something something friends that stuff
[1:35:52] is a is a fountain of
[1:35:55] poison I understand we live lives I
[1:35:58] understand I get it we we have this
