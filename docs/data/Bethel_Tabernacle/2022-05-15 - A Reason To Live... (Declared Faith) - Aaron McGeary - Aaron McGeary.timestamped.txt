[1:19] they're preaching on the resurrection
[1:22] from first corinthians 15
[1:24] and he was preaching the resurrection
[1:26] and he stopped right in the middle of
[1:27] his sermon and he said you know so many
[1:30] people are afraid of defeat
[1:33] he said when general patton lost a bunch
[1:35] of soldiers
[1:36] said then they told him he sat back and
[1:38] he wanted some more and they sent him up
[1:39] some more he got them killed and he sent
[1:41] for some more and when he got them third
[1:43] bunch up there said every time a bullet
[1:45] would wind they'd run out of ten or
[1:47] running or something other scared he
[1:48] said say me up man not kids he said i
[1:52] want man that's ready to die i don't
[1:53] want somebody's free to die if the cause
[1:56] we're fighting for is not worthy to die
[1:57] for then keep them away from me i want
[1:59] man he said but you've lost two or three
[2:02] battles he said i haven't lost a war
[2:05] i just lost a battle
[2:07] something spoke in my heart
[2:09] i remember eisenhower said when i
[2:11] thought a bullet commanded and they
[2:12] threw a shell in the gun they pulled it
[2:14] off and it was a fizzle it didn't work
[2:16] said i didn't quit and surrender i
[2:18] pulled the bullet out and put another
[2:19] one in tried it didn't work i put
[2:20] another one in until one did work
[2:24] that's the way it's got to be done
[2:26] i don't know how to be but god is my
[2:28] judge over this pulpit i don't know how
[2:30] many fizzles and how many how many
[2:32] battles i lose but i'll not lose the war
[2:34] he told me he'd be with me i'll stand
[2:37] alone see that ministry confirmed and
[2:39] sit in operation i begin this morning by
[2:42] the grace of god i don't know where to
[2:43] work here where to work somewhere else
[2:45] how to work or what will take place i'll
[2:47] walk right down prayer lines praying for
[2:48] the sick until i do know what's
[2:51] happening
[2:53] today
[3:01] you might not be able to
[3:16] faith
[3:27] [Music]
[3:34] i always want to be a soldier
[3:38] with a second war come along at war i
[3:40] was too young the next war they wouldn't
[3:42] take me
[3:43] but i finally got the joy in the army
[3:47] the army of the soldiers of the cross
[3:52] my uniform is not only outside this
[3:54] afternoon it's on the inside
[3:57] god gave me a uniform that wasn't trade
[3:59] for everything in the world
[4:02] the baptism of the holy spirit
[4:05] dressed me up as a soldier from the
[4:07] inside beginning grace to stand
[4:10] in the hours
[4:14] [Music]
[4:29] [Music]
[4:48] [Music]
[4:55] [Music]
[5:03] like a book i read
[5:05] what is that called romeo and juliet is
[5:07] that what it was or something he left
[5:09] that got the ladder upside down
[5:10] somewhere opera a long time ago and come
[5:12] god is
[5:13] getting out at nighttime
[5:16] now that's the way that it'll uh it'll
[5:19] take place
[5:20] and it'll be gone not they'll have set a
[5:23] bunch of angels down with some spades
[5:24] and dig up the graves the bible said
[5:27] will be changed before even you could
[5:30] bat your eye just a twinkle it'll all be
[5:32] over that quick
[5:34] just say somebody disappeared well
[5:37] would imagine if we could search the
[5:39] world over today there's been 500 people
[5:41] disappear off the earth each day
[5:44] yeah
[5:45] but they don't know what i'm about
[5:46] they just come up disappearing
[5:49] well there ain't going to be too many go
[5:51] in that rapture now i don't want to
[5:53] scare you and i and i i i don't think
[5:56] it's that way but i just want to tell
[5:57] you what he said and you know it
[5:59] yourself as it was in the days of noah
[6:02] wherein eight souls were saved by water
[6:06] eight souls out of the world
[6:10] be saved by water what do you say oh my
[6:13] i don't need to be trying that show you
[6:15] haven't got the kind of faith you need
[6:17] if there's just going to be one that'll
[6:19] be me
[6:20] amen because i believe
[6:23] that's where you want to believe
[6:26] me
[6:28] i want to live so close jim now i know
[6:29] he's going to take me when he comes i
[6:31] believe it
[6:33] so
[6:33] if everybody else has done he'll be
[6:35] there
[6:36] by his grace because he promised me that
[6:38] and i know i i'll be there because he
[6:41] can't lie and i know my soul
[6:43] life bears record and i try to live
[6:45] daily just like he was coming so i i'm
[6:48] going to be that one
[6:49] that's where you want to feel if he's
[6:50] going to be eight i'll be one that eight
[6:53] will be 500 i'm going to be one of that
[6:54] 500. i don't know about the other fellow
[6:56] but i don't want to be one of their 500.
[6:59] that's the way you want to remember and
[7:02] if you don't remember it like that
[7:03] there's something wrong with your faith
[7:06] you're not sure you're saved yet then
[7:08] you're just guessing at it
[7:10] [Music]
[7:11] do that
[7:21] [Music]
[7:57] [Music]
[8:20] [Music]
[8:31] a man said to me the other day said i
[8:33] think you're just a fine man mr brandon
[8:35] but i believe you're sincerely wrong
[8:37] you're all out of the will you know
[8:39] you'll be condemned at the end
[8:41] i said look i want to tell you something
[8:44] i'm going to say that you it should be
[8:45] right just to say for your argument say
[8:48] if i am wrong which i i don't believe i
[8:51] am
[8:52] but if i was wrong and i know right now
[8:55] that i was going to live to be 100 years
[8:57] old and he is going to condemn me at the
[8:59] end of the road and tell me you don't
[9:01] deserve to come into my heaven william
[9:03] branham get out of the outer darkness
[9:05] you know what i'd serve him every day of
[9:07] my life until
[9:09] i went anyhow
[9:11] for i have received so much of his
[9:14] unmerited blessings
[9:16] that he's more than life to me
[9:19] he's everything that i
[9:21] all that i am all that i ever could hope
[9:23] to be
[9:24] i have derived from his grace and mercy
[9:29] i was wretched miserable poor blind but
[9:33] by grace he has healed me and i am
[9:36] strong and healthy by the grace of god i
[9:39] have good eye sight i have eat drink
[9:42] have whatever i have need of you never
[9:44] promise supply my wants my needs
[9:46] and if i am cast away at that day and i
[9:50] know i cannot see where i would be but
[9:52] if
[9:53] i knew that i was wrong
[9:56] and god has
[9:57] chosen me to be wrong
[10:00] i would want to stay wrong
[10:03] and because that i want to do his will
[10:07] it's i love him until i want his will to
[10:09] be done now that's a big statement but i
[10:12] hope you get it in the way of spirit i
[10:13] said it in see i want to do his will i
[10:16] asked him for something sometimes jake
[10:18] said no i just rejoiced so much about
[10:20] that as a kenneth he said yes
[10:22] because we always ought to ask thy will
[10:26] be done
[10:27] his nose is just as if that's his will
[10:30] that's just it's a whole lot better than
[10:31] his yeses if it's his will to do it
[10:34] that's when you really love him
[10:36] amen
[10:38] i get to talk about him i just can't
[10:39] stop
[10:41] oh oh he's so real
[10:43] so real to me friends he's all that i am
[10:48] all that i ever could be all that i ever
[10:50] expect to be is grounded in christ jesus
[10:53] his word i'm thankful tonight for the
[10:56] witness of the holy spirit for the
[10:58] message
[10:59] i know it might some might disagree with
[11:01] it but as i have told you i'm duty bound
[11:03] to a message
[11:05] [Music]
[11:20] you know i feel like paul said here i'm
[11:22] looking at a scripture in acts 20
[11:24] 24 he said none of these things move me
[11:29] amen
[11:31] why
[11:32] for he was anchored
[11:35] he had an absolute
[11:37] since i met him on the road to damascus
[11:40] if i could talk to paul he turned me
[11:43] around
[11:44] started me back in the right way
[11:46] i was off the word he put me back on the
[11:49] word
[11:50] yes sir
[11:51] listen i feel that way too i feel that
[11:54] any man that's born of the spirit of god
[11:56] that loves god and loves his word god
[11:59] has a purpose in that god had a purpose
[12:01] in turning paul around
[12:03] did not he say i'm going to show in him
[12:05] his glory
[12:07] god had a purpose when he saved me
[12:09] i'm determined to do his will
[12:11] not add to it or take away from it
[12:13] revelations 22 19 said whosoever shall
[12:16] do it will be is part taken from the
[12:18] book of life
[12:19] i'm determined to never add one thing of
[12:22] my own opinion to that word i'm
[12:23] determined to read it just the way it is
[12:25] and and ask god that i open to my heart
[12:28] and receive it work it through me lord
[12:30] that others might see may it become
[12:32] salty
[12:34] or something real that others might see
[12:36] yes sir now
[12:39] if he is our absolute there can be no
[12:41] other absolute
[12:43] you can't have same on my my church is
[12:45] my absolute my creed is my absolute if
[12:47] christ is your absolute you believe
[12:50] christ's word there's no other way to do
[12:52] it you know i think about the time that
[12:54] he saved me i'll tell you why i stand
[12:57] the way i do not to be different i've
[12:59] made myself clear on that i hope i have
[13:01] but i
[13:03] when christ saved me there were millions
[13:05] of people groping and sin when he saved
[13:08] me he had a purpose in doing it
[13:11] he had a purpose in saving me he just
[13:13] seen an ignoramus like me and and
[13:16] somehow another one there's plenty of
[13:17] smart man
[13:18] more able man man that could do it
[13:21] me earth not even a hardest seventh
[13:23] grade education one there's a man who
[13:25] studied in school and got degrees and
[13:28] doctors of of divinity and philosophy
[13:31] and so forth but when christ saved me he
[13:33] had a purpose in doing it or never saved
[13:35] me
[13:37] listen brethren i love you and you know
[13:39] that but i'm determined in my heart that
[13:42] i'll never back on that word i'll stay
[13:44] right there that's my absolute i've been
[13:46] tied to all these years
[13:48] uh he had a purpose in doing it right
[13:51] and i aim to see that purpose soon to
[13:53] stay with that word not to be different
[13:56] not to be mean but to be honest and
[13:58] sincere with god that's right
[14:04] [Music]
[14:07] don't let yourself be fooled don't let
[14:09] the devil pat you on the shoulder say
[14:11] when i go to church the devil does too
[14:14] fine be sure they'd come up to god went
[14:16] to church in heaven
[14:17] come before the sorrow of god was the
[14:19] sons of god set out with him
[14:21] not an audience with god he said where
[14:24] do you mean to walk if you're in florida
[14:25] on the earth
[14:26] that's where he has been
[14:28] so the devil goes to church
[14:30] the devil belongs to church
[14:33] the devil acts like a christian
[14:36] he's a deceiver and if he doesn't act
[14:39] like a christian and act like a church
[14:41] he would be in the sea
[14:43] [Music]
[14:48] [Music]
[14:56] friends are there it's time for the
[14:59] prophets of god
[15:01] oh brothers for the preachers that you
[15:04] would say across the nation to follow
[15:07] their faith when you look ahead your
[15:08] bible out somewhere laying out before
[15:10] god on your knees of praying for the
[15:13] sins of the country and i'm guilty with
[15:16] you
[15:17] i have made my mind up by the help and
[15:20] grace of god if i god will give me
[15:23] strength i'm determined
[15:25] [Music]
[15:32] [Applause]
[15:34] [Music]
[15:35] [Applause]
[15:36] amen
[15:39] [Music]
[15:51] [Music]
[15:54] now we know that we're close to the end
[15:57] of a we're right at the door of a global
[16:00] destruction
[16:02] we know that hanging in the hangars
[16:04] right now is bombs did you read the life
[16:07] magazine i believe it was a few days ago
[16:08] or weeks ago where that general said
[16:11] that this is the first one or boys top
[16:13] that's a expression i'm going to touch
[16:16] off one of them bombs what's going to
[16:17] happen
[16:18] they're already hanging there
[16:21] they're ready they can time them by
[16:23] radar and the stars
[16:25] they can drop one from moscow right on
[16:28] uh
[16:28] vine street or sunset boulevard and by
[16:32] exactly on the dot right on the target
[16:35] any where they want to drop one they can
[16:38] do it
[16:40] and we're sitting right out there in the
[16:41] ocean with these big ships when you see
[16:43] them the other day them submarines come
[16:44] up and they wouldn't even let us get
[16:45] near with that radar bomb sitting there
[16:48] they could put one right on my scar
[16:50] anywhere they want to put it now what
[16:52] one of these days somebody's going to
[16:53] make a slip
[16:55] and they're going to pull one
[16:57] and when they pull it's going to be
[16:59] pulling on this side too
[17:03] what's the world going to do it can't
[17:04] stand it
[17:06] there'll be a burst in a shaking
[17:09] world of fly to pieces
[17:10] that could happen before the sun goes
[17:12] down tonight
[17:14] a great general speaking on the other
[17:16] day said the next war that takes place
[17:18] will only be three minutes long
[17:22] three minutes
[17:24] no wonder science says it's three
[17:26] minutes till midnight
[17:28] three minutes is all it'll take to rock
[17:30] the world completely to pieces and blow
[17:32] it up
[17:36] we're living on bar time
[17:40] some fanatic one of these days is going
[17:41] to touch on them all
[17:43] and when they out there of them
[17:45] listening post and everything and ears
[17:47] alert when they hear that first whistle
[17:48] go for that bomb going across they're
[17:51] going to pull them too
[17:52] and then when that starts it's going to
[17:54] pull both ways and here they come it'll
[17:56] be a constant completely
[17:59] rocking in this world go into volcanic
[18:01] ashes
[18:02] that's all it can do
[18:04] it can never stand it one of them bombs
[18:06] will blow a hole in the ground 175 feet
[18:08] deep 100 miles square
[18:14] and how about 10 000 of those turned
[18:16] loose on the united states at one time
[18:18] where's your living going to be
[18:19] the world couldn't stand that shock even
[18:22] now until the science is claiming that
[18:24] the the earth is bulging out in the
[18:26] middle you've seen that here the other
[18:28] day and heard them talking of it that
[18:29] they're the waters in the north there's
[18:31] went down so many feet
[18:33] are in the middle of the earth rather
[18:34] and getting deeper in the north and then
[18:36] south because the earth is bulging out
[18:41] the sun doesn't go around its orbit like
[18:43] it used to
[18:45] everything is indicating that coming of
[18:47] the lord
[18:48] we're right at the door and remember
[18:51] before one of those bombs can drop
[18:56] don't forget this
[19:00] jesus said as it was in the days of noah
[19:02] and in the days of lot so shall it be in
[19:05] the coming of the son of man
[19:07] and before
[19:09] norfolk any rain fell down nor was in
[19:12] the ark safely
[19:15] before any fire fell on sodom lot was
[19:18] outside
[19:19] [Music]
[19:22] and before one bomb can strike it the
[19:25] church will be home in glory gone in
[19:30] be sure
[19:32] then if this
[19:33] just to think right
[19:35] if it's that
[19:36] close how much closer is the coming of
[19:40] the lord
[19:41] because the lord comes before that
[19:43] happens
[19:55] [Music]
[19:58] one of the ministers will probably pick
[19:59] it up in a few minutes on the oncoming
[20:01] judgments
[20:03] and i hope they do
[20:04] anyhow on the oncoming judgment
[20:07] [Music]
[20:08] because the whole world is ready to is
[20:11] quivering every nation is quivering
[20:14] don't you think that russia is
[20:15] equivalent to
[20:16] the united states the islands are
[20:18] equivalent who's going to throw that
[20:20] first atomic bomb when it does it may
[20:23] throw a whole thing out of cater or not
[20:24] be a
[20:26] cobalt bomb watch as few of them's that
[20:28] loose
[20:30] there won't be even a fire and insect on
[20:32] the face of the earth
[20:35] it's right now in the hands of wicked
[20:37] sinful hellbound man
[20:40] and your destination of this earth's
[20:46] journey to the hands of wicked and
[20:49] sinful man
[20:51] you better watch where your soul's
[20:53] destination is pledged far
[20:56] if it isn't pledged towards heaven and
[20:58] towards god turn the night with all your
[21:00] heart don't let the old air pass away
[21:04] without you turning to god
[21:07] for your
[21:08] earthly destination is determined by the
[21:11] hands of wicked and cruel
[21:14] cold-hearted idiotic man
[21:18] that's where your body is determined
[21:20] whatever they want to do about it now
[21:22] that finishes you up
[21:26] god be merciful
[21:28] and god in his loving mercy send in
[21:31] signs and wonders and miracles and
[21:33] everything and preach the gospel and
[21:34] people constantly turning your face away
[21:37] from it
[21:39] then how can you expect anything else
[21:41] for judgment you must receive it
[21:44] and one man being healed of policy in
[21:47] the whole country turned to christ
[21:50] and here where we have kings and
[21:51] overtakes monarchs and
[21:54] congressmen and everything else of
[21:56] afflictions and diseases and dead and
[21:59] passed away and see them rise to life
[22:01] again and the nation only scored a life
[22:04] at it
[22:06] then what we got left for judgment
[22:08] oh brother if there ever was a time that
[22:11] god wake up his people is the day
[22:16] this coming year make god anoint his
[22:19] ministers like planes of fire

[1:20:50] and fear of the future may you speak to
[1:20:52] it tonight lord
[1:20:54] and settle once and for all the sin

[1:21:02] and reveal yourself through your word
[1:21:03] tonight i pray we commit ourselves to
[1:21:06] you now lord take control this service
[1:21:07] for your glory
[1:21:08] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:21:10] amen amen amen god bless you i'm going
[1:21:13] to be reading from ecclesiastes chapter
[1:21:15] 2.
[1:21:17] so if you could uh turn there
[1:21:18] ecclesiastes chapter 2 it's kind of a
[1:21:21] lengthy reading i want to read to verse
[1:21:22] 17
[1:21:23] uh so that will give us
[1:21:25] we can kind of just make reference to a
[1:21:27] few things
[1:21:30] i'm so happy to be here i know that the
[1:21:32] day has already been very full
[1:21:34] and it's kind of it's a short weekend a
[1:21:36] lot of travel for some people a lot of
[1:21:38] preparation leading up to these times
[1:21:40] for a host church by the time you get to
[1:21:42] service on friday night you're exhausted
[1:21:45] and then just as the weekend and the
[1:21:47] activities unfold it just gets more
[1:21:49] tiring for the local church so i'm not
[1:21:51] giving you an excuse to sleep on me
[1:21:53] tonight i'm just saying i understand
[1:21:55] and and will and recognize just what a
[1:21:57] wonderful feat it will be that you are
[1:21:59] pulling and entering in every single
[1:22:01] moment for those traveling with the
[1:22:02] excitement of the weekend i know that it
[1:22:04] can be uh tiresome but we've we've come
[1:22:07] to this moment and this is what we're
[1:22:08] all here for um the activities
[1:22:10] throughout the day are wonderful we get
[1:22:12] to know one another god can even use the
[1:22:14] fellowship and the camaraderie we have
[1:22:16] as uh young believers to strengthen us
[1:22:18] and encourage us and it kind of puts us
[1:22:20] in kind of the same mind and we begin to
[1:22:22] even kind of melt together through those
[1:22:24] activities and really it's to promote
[1:22:26] moments like this where some of the uh
[1:22:29] mystery is removed and we start to get
[1:22:30] familiar with one another and we can
[1:22:32] come and uh settle our hearts and just
[1:22:34] open up to hear from god so this is this
[1:22:36] is really what we're here for is for the
[1:22:38] word and so i really would um appreciate
[1:22:41] especially for the young people just to
[1:22:42] be very very attentive
[1:22:44] and focused tonight
[1:22:46] ecclesiastes chapter 2 verse 1. i said
[1:22:48] in my heart go to now i will prove thee
[1:22:51] with mirth
[1:22:52] therefore enjoy pleasure and behold this
[1:22:54] also is vanity i said of laughter it is
[1:22:58] mad and of mirth what do with it i
[1:23:00] sought in my heart to give myself unto
[1:23:02] wine yet acquainting my heart with
[1:23:03] wisdom and delay hold on folly till i
[1:23:06] might see what was the good for the sons
[1:23:07] of men which they should do under the
[1:23:09] heaven all the days of their life and i
[1:23:11] made me great works i builded me houses
[1:23:13] i planted me vineyards i made me gardens
[1:23:15] and orchards and i planted trees in them
[1:23:17] of all kinds of fruits and i made me
[1:23:19] pools of water to water there there with
[1:23:22] the wood that bringeth forth trees i got
[1:23:24] me servants and maidens and had servants
[1:23:26] born in my house and i also had great
[1:23:28] possessions of great and small cattle
[1:23:29] above all that were in jerusalem before
[1:23:32] me i gathered me also silver and gold
[1:23:34] and the peculiar treasure of kings and
[1:23:35] of the provinces i get me men singers
[1:23:38] and women singers and the delights of
[1:23:39] the sons of men as musical instruments
[1:23:41] and all that of all and that of all
[1:23:43] sorts so i was great and increased more
[1:23:45] than all that were before me in
[1:23:46] jerusalem also my wisdom remained with
[1:23:49] me
[1:23:50] whatsoever my eyes desired i kept not
[1:23:52] from them i withheld not my heart from
[1:23:54] any joy for my heart rejoiced in all my
[1:23:56] labor and this was my portion of all my
[1:23:58] labor then i looked on all the works
[1:24:00] that my hands had wrought and on the
[1:24:02] labor that i had labored to do and
[1:24:04] behold all was vanity and vexation of
[1:24:06] spirit and there was no prophet under
[1:24:08] the sun
[1:24:09] and i turned myself to behold wisdom and
[1:24:11] madness and folly for what can the man
[1:24:13] do that cometh after the king even that
[1:24:15] which hath been already done then i saw
[1:24:17] that wisdom excelleth folly as far as
[1:24:19] the light excel with darkness the wise
[1:24:21] man's eyes are in his head but the full
[1:24:23] walketh in darkness and i myself
[1:24:24] perceived also that one event happeneth
[1:24:27] to them all
[1:24:29] then i said and notice he's saying to
[1:24:30] the fool and to the wise one event
[1:24:32] happeneth to them all then said i in my
[1:24:34] heart as it happeneth to the full so it
[1:24:36] happened even to me
[1:24:38] why was i then more wise then i said in
[1:24:40] my heart this that this also is
[1:24:42] vanity for there is no remembrance of
[1:24:44] the wise more than of the fool forever
[1:24:47] seeing that which now is in the days to
[1:24:49] come shall all be forgotten and how diet
[1:24:51] the wise man as the fool
[1:24:54] therefore i hated life
[1:24:56] because the work that is rotten to the
[1:24:57] sun is grievous unto me
[1:24:59] for all is vanity and vexation of spirit
[1:25:03] god bless you you could be seated
[1:25:05] i mentioned uh last night at the outset
[1:25:08] and i want to take some time going back
[1:25:09] over some of the principles maybe just
[1:25:11] some key words from last night just to
[1:25:13] make sure they're kind of connected and
[1:25:15] we're tracking together
[1:25:16] and i mentioned last night we're going
[1:25:18] to kind of explore the idea
[1:25:19] of life having meaning or purpose
[1:25:22] and reference maybe the purpose and
[1:25:24] value of human existence and alluded to
[1:25:27] kind of a branch of philosophy um that
[1:25:30] existentialism that looks at life as you
[1:25:32] know why are we here what's the whole
[1:25:34] purpose of everything and even
[1:25:36] sets forth the idea that life is absurd
[1:25:39] and so there's a dread and anxiety that
[1:25:41] strikes the human heart when they
[1:25:43] consider
[1:25:44] life and they consider its
[1:25:46] inconsistencies
[1:25:47] and then we pointed out how brother
[1:25:49] branham described nervous tensions in
[1:25:51] this age that we seem so unfitted to
[1:25:54] live in and i'm wanting just to still
[1:25:56] kind of keep that in our thoughts and so
[1:25:58] my title tonight is a reason to live
[1:26:02] last night we spoke on a reason now
[1:26:04] another part unfolds i said last night
[1:26:07] that each sermon is connected together
[1:26:09] so tonight is a reason to live and then
[1:26:12] my subtitle is declared faith
[1:26:14] last night was a deliberate deliberate
[1:26:17] faith now
[1:26:18] declared faith
[1:26:20] in first peter chapter 3
[1:26:23] verse 15. i'm going to do some things
[1:26:25] just to review it says but sanctify the
[1:26:27] lord god in your hearts and be ready
[1:26:29] always to give an answer to every man
[1:26:31] that asketh you a reason of the hope
[1:26:33] that is in you with meekness and fear so
[1:26:36] an answer is a reason statement or
[1:26:38] argument and it's saying you must give a
[1:26:40] declaration and express the reason of
[1:26:44] the hope with your ass you need to give
[1:26:45] an answer and the answer is the reason
[1:26:48] of the hope that you have with meekness
[1:26:50] and fear so you're being provoked to
[1:26:52] give some explanation to give some
[1:26:54] clarity as to why you believe
[1:26:56] and and it must be with some you must
[1:26:58] have some reason behind that you want to
[1:27:00] be able to articulate why it is that you
[1:27:03] believe and brother branham said you
[1:27:05] can't have faith unless you got some
[1:27:08] reason and we looked at a number of
[1:27:09] places where brother brahma says you
[1:27:11] really he says if you want to be healed
[1:27:12] he says what do you want to be healed
[1:27:13] for
[1:27:14] there has to be some reason some motive
[1:27:16] and objective to that healing and so
[1:27:19] reason is a motive a reason is a cause
[1:27:21] for acting or thinking in a particular
[1:27:23] way if you say what's the reason for
[1:27:25] this you're kind of looking at the cause
[1:27:27] that which causes something a motive for
[1:27:29] an action
[1:27:31] or some sort of determination for
[1:27:32] something and so we looked at even in
[1:27:35] the principles in the message of the
[1:27:37] hour what motive is your motivation or
[1:27:39] your motive is your incentive to act a
[1:27:41] particular way it's your it's your
[1:27:43] reason for doing something
[1:27:45] and brother branham brings this out in a
[1:27:47] number of places about how your motive
[1:27:49] and objective have to be right you see
[1:27:51] it in the word of god first then your
[1:27:52] motive and objective have to be right he
[1:27:54] said as long as your motive is wrong no
[1:27:56] matter what your objective is but your
[1:27:58] motive to that objective is wrong then
[1:28:00] it will never work it might seem to be
[1:28:02] getting more complicated but it's just
[1:28:03] showing things have to line up you could
[1:28:06] have an objective that is right but your
[1:28:08] motive to that objective also has to be
[1:28:10] right for it to work out correctly and
[1:28:13] your objective is your purpose it's your
[1:28:15] what's being aimed at that which towards
[1:28:17] something a conscious act is directed
[1:28:21] and this kind of brings into view so
[1:28:23] we're just reason i want you to think
[1:28:24] about reason and motive and objective
[1:28:26] and purpose the purpose again is the
[1:28:28] object so reason speaks to motive
[1:28:30] objective speaks to purpose these things
[1:28:32] are kind of just different terminologies
[1:28:34] that we use it's a a purpose is the
[1:28:36] result that is intended it's your intent
[1:28:38] and so as we expressed last night you
[1:28:40] must have
[1:28:42] a deliberate motive we need to be acting
[1:28:44] purposely and even our faith must be
[1:28:47] it's not just going blank it's just not
[1:28:49] accepting whatever comes our way but but
[1:28:51] we have a belief we have a conviction we
[1:28:53] have a desire and we want to be very
[1:28:55] deliberate because we don't have the
[1:28:56] right motive we want to be trying to
[1:28:58] accomplish the right things and so
[1:29:00] tonight i want to take a step further in
[1:29:01] it from a deliberate faith to declared
[1:29:04] faith
[1:29:05] and a reason to live
[1:29:07] and i want to focus in the book of
[1:29:10] genesis in the book of ecclesiastes
[1:29:12] and and kind of set the scene for how
[1:29:15] human life was supposed to be and then
[1:29:16] kind of come up to what it actually is
[1:29:18] now and to get us thinking
[1:29:21] in genesis chapter 1 verse 1
[1:29:24] it says in the beginning god created the
[1:29:26] heaven and the earth
[1:29:29] now if you could i
[1:29:31] i don't know if it says i'm just
[1:29:32] checking my watch just now so this is my
[1:29:34] official start time i'm going to start
[1:29:36] doing that on purpose you know wait in
[1:29:37] 15 minutes before you check so you kind
[1:29:39] of get a free free 15 minutes
[1:29:41] uh
[1:29:43] i i
[1:29:44] if you could if i'm maybe unique to
[1:29:46] listen to in a youth meeting context i
[1:29:48] think that's all right sometimes just to
[1:29:49] go a little bit different way that might
[1:29:51] even be the reason why they asked me to
[1:29:53] come is we need something really
[1:29:54] different just to kind of break up the
[1:29:55] flow um so if you could just focus with
[1:29:57] me and uh two things maybe one if you
[1:30:00] stay with me i know in the end god will
[1:30:02] speak to you
[1:30:03] and another thing is i know i love you
[1:30:06] and my heart's for you and i want the
[1:30:08] best for you and i have no fear that
[1:30:10] you're going to fail
[1:30:12] so i'm just absolutely positive what i'm
[1:30:14] preaching tonight that it's going to hit
[1:30:15] the mark for you and it's going to make
[1:30:16] a difference so it's not coming from
[1:30:19] it's not coming from a bad place in my
[1:30:20] heart it's coming i have a nothing but
[1:30:22] love for you
[1:30:23] and know that i'm sharing something
[1:30:25] that's going to help you so maybe those
[1:30:26] couple things will kind of help us relax
[1:30:28] a little bit
[1:30:29] so again in genesis chapter 1 verse 1 it
[1:30:31] says in the beginning god created the
[1:30:33] heaven and earth this is very critical
[1:30:35] background now just to kind of think
[1:30:37] about the scene
[1:30:38] and we know that god's existence
[1:30:40] precedes this act that god always
[1:30:42] eternally existing
[1:30:44] uh now we're introduced to him at the
[1:30:46] outset of the bible that god creates and
[1:30:48] i want you to ponder that in god
[1:30:50] creating there was a reason and a motive
[1:30:53] behind this creative act god was not
[1:30:56] just bored in eternity and said let's
[1:30:58] try this let's do something let's just
[1:31:00] see what's going to happen but god has a
[1:31:03] a very specific intent in forming and
[1:31:05] creating the heaven and the earth
[1:31:08] it's interesting when you think about it
[1:31:10] and i maybe kind of vary in a little bit
[1:31:11] here just because the pool is so nice
[1:31:14] that god in the very first verse of the
[1:31:16] bible he tells us what his plan is
[1:31:18] in the beginning god created the heaven
[1:31:20] and the earth and he's already told us
[1:31:21] this whole story that he's going to
[1:31:23] create he's going to have a heavenly
[1:31:26] bridegroom and an earthly bride in the
[1:31:28] beginning god created the heaven and it
[1:31:30] created the earth and then he further
[1:31:32] helps us to understand the whole process
[1:31:34] because then it says the earth was
[1:31:35] chaotic without form and with void and
[1:31:37] so we can relate to that condition
[1:31:39] because we come to this world as human
[1:31:41] beings in a chaotic form
[1:31:43] and discombobulated and everything is
[1:31:45] turned upside down and all we need is
[1:31:47] the spirit of god to move upon us to
[1:31:48] bring the order that we need so god at
[1:31:50] the very beginning of the bible is
[1:31:52] trying to tell you what he's going to do
[1:31:53] through the entire book and the way
[1:31:55] things will end up in the end and so god
[1:31:58] when he creates there was a broader
[1:32:00] purpose to this act than just creating a
[1:32:02] heaven and earth
[1:32:04] it wasn't just let's see what we can do
[1:32:05] or manifest his power and i'm going to
[1:32:07] run through several verses here very
[1:32:09] quickly just to make reference to the
[1:32:12] purpose of god in second timothy chapter
[1:32:14] 1 verse 9 says who hath saved us and
[1:32:16] called us with the holy calling not
[1:32:18] according to our works but according to
[1:32:21] his own purpose and his own grace which
[1:32:24] was given us in christ jesus
[1:32:26] before the world began so even before he
[1:32:29] created he had a purpose and he had a
[1:32:31] grace and it was given to us in christ
[1:32:34] before the world began so he has his own
[1:32:37] purpose in romans 9 11 that the purpose
[1:32:40] of god according to election might stand
[1:32:42] romans 8 28 them who are the called
[1:32:45] according to his purpose this is
[1:32:47] something that's mentioned over and over
[1:32:49] again and you all know this so knowing
[1:32:51] that it's scripture your amen should be
[1:32:53] a little bit heartier at this point he's
[1:32:55] like yeah i know that i've heard that
[1:32:56] that's true amen we believe that and so
[1:32:58] it's according to his own purpose the
[1:33:00] purpose of god his purpose ephesians 1
[1:33:02] 11 predestinated according to the
[1:33:04] purpose of him who worketh all things
[1:33:07] after the counsel of his own will
[1:33:11] ephesians 3 11 according to the eternal
[1:33:13] purpose which he purposed in christ
[1:33:15] jesus our lord so god has a purpose
[1:33:21] and it's his own purpose god is
[1:33:22] intentional god is very when god acts he
[1:33:25] has a reason behind it
[1:33:27] there's a lot of things we do especially
[1:33:28] in the day and age that we're living in
[1:33:30] where people just do things for views
[1:33:32] and uh and there's really nothing beyond
[1:33:34] it than just that and and god wasn't
[1:33:37] just looking for clicks when he wrote
[1:33:38] the bible this bible is not click bait
[1:33:40] uh there was something bigger than and
[1:33:42] followers and views it was something
[1:33:44] very rich and very deep and so when he's
[1:33:46] perfect when he has a purpose it's a
[1:33:48] setting forth
[1:33:49] when it speaks of a purpose it's already
[1:33:51] determined beforehand you know he's not
[1:33:53] just starting something and saying well
[1:33:54] i'm just going to figure out where i'm
[1:33:56] going and i started this i never asked
[1:33:58] myself what my purpose is i never asked
[1:34:00] myself what i'm trying to accomplish and
[1:34:02] there may be some brothers here who who
[1:34:04] have started businesses or wanted to
[1:34:06] make money wanted to do different things
[1:34:07] and you get started you kind of get
[1:34:09] wrapped up in it and you've bought
[1:34:10] things and you've gotten well down the
[1:34:11] road and someone says well what's your
[1:34:12] business plan
[1:34:14] you know what are you trying to
[1:34:15] accomplish what's your objective i i met
[1:34:16] a young man one time and he had seen a
[1:34:18] friend of his uh hand out flyers for
[1:34:20] lawn care and uh this guy got a number
[1:34:22] of accounts and it worked really really
[1:34:24] good and so this guy went out and handed
[1:34:25] out hundreds of flyers to clean fish
[1:34:28] tanks
[1:34:29] and he came back and he was all
[1:34:30] frustrated and i didn't get one person
[1:34:32] called back i said i want you to
[1:34:33] understand something you didn't really
[1:34:34] think through this
[1:34:36] every place that person put a flyer for
[1:34:38] lawn care he knew they had a lawn
[1:34:40] i said you have no idea whether or not
[1:34:42] anyone you gave a flyer to had a fish
[1:34:44] tank
[1:34:45] it's like passing out a flyer for pool
[1:34:47] cleaning at an apartment complex
[1:34:49] i was like i never thought about that
[1:34:51] maybe you should think through it first
[1:34:52] and put some flyers at a pet store
[1:34:55] so you think about things and you have a
[1:34:57] deliberate mode of an objective and a
[1:34:58] purpose and god was that way
[1:35:01] god did it on purpose
[1:35:03] god had a reason for doing it if i could
[1:35:05] say this god had a deliberate faith
[1:35:08] he had a determined purpose that he had
[1:35:10] set before him god had an objective one
[1:35:13] thing to think about is that god
[1:35:14] whatever god requires of you god holds
[1:35:16] himself to as well because it's his word
[1:35:19] he binds himself to his word so if
[1:35:20] there's if there's something worth
[1:35:22] checking in our motive and objective
[1:35:24] then god has kind of a similar uh
[1:35:26] nature to himself he had reason he had
[1:35:28] purpose he had a deliberate faith he had
[1:35:30] he determined he's something he intended
[1:35:32] to do the very moment he created the
[1:35:34] heaven and the earth and said that was a
[1:35:35] purposeful act why he's already
[1:35:37] foreshadowing the groom and the bride
[1:35:39] and the union of the two
[1:35:42] brother ram said he spoke the word now i
[1:35:44] want you to think of that declaration he
[1:35:45] spoke the word and said let there be and
[1:35:48] the world came into existence you find a
[1:35:50] number of places brother around uses
[1:35:52] this kind of thought all things that you
[1:35:53] see were made by faith in the spoken
[1:35:55] word of god let there be and he believed
[1:35:59] his own word
[1:36:01] god asks you to believe his word he
[1:36:03] believes his own word so god in him had
[1:36:05] a determined purpose he had something
[1:36:07] inside of him that he wanted to
[1:36:08] accomplish and so we could say that that
[1:36:10] was even a faith even a revelation and
[1:36:13] now when he speaks it and he's declaring
[1:36:15] what he wants to do let there be there's
[1:36:17] a faith that's chasing that and god
[1:36:20] believed his own word so guess what was
[1:36:22] going to happen there was going to be
[1:36:23] light
[1:36:24] and there was light his purpose was
[1:36:26] declared by faith
[1:36:28] so god had faith in his own eternal
[1:36:30] purpose
[1:36:32] and and what we can see in genesis 1 is
[1:36:34] that creation was a declaration of the
[1:36:36] intent of god declaration of his purpose
[1:36:40] now to further unfold this we see in
[1:36:42] genesis chapter 1 verse 26 now this is
[1:36:45] god who has reason this is god who has
[1:36:47] purpose and deliberate intent
[1:36:50] in verse 26 it says god said let us make
[1:36:52] man in our image so if god had a reason
[1:36:55] if god had purpose then when he makes
[1:36:57] man in this image he also likewise is
[1:36:59] going to have it let us make man in our
[1:37:01] image and after our likeness and let
[1:37:04] them have divine dominion over the fish
[1:37:06] of the sea
[1:37:07] and over the fowl of the air and over
[1:37:08] the cattle and over all the earth and
[1:37:10] over every creeping thing that creepeth
[1:37:11] upon the earth
[1:37:13] so now the image of god is now reflected
[1:37:17] in man
[1:37:18] god who's the invisible god
[1:37:20] now has his image in the man and maybe
[1:37:23] the first characteristic that kind of
[1:37:25] gives us a glimpse of how this is being
[1:37:27] expressed is he says let them have
[1:37:29] dominion so it's first established in
[1:37:31] the dominion that they're going to have
[1:37:33] all created things so god the highest in
[1:37:35] heaven as god in heaven the invisible
[1:37:37] god now man is a visible god on earth he
[1:37:41] has dominion over all created things and
[1:37:43] he's to be kind of a reflection of god
[1:37:45] on earth
[1:37:47] are you staying with me so far we're
[1:37:48] just kind of telling the creation story
[1:37:49] just to set the scene and i want to kind
[1:37:52] of bounce around and i'm going to cherry
[1:37:53] pick uh what points i want to bring out
[1:37:55] because i'm the one preaching and i get
[1:37:56] to do that
[1:37:58] it's really awesome how this works right
[1:37:59] you're going to preach so you get to
[1:38:00] choose you can kind of choose how you
[1:38:02] put this together so you're going to be
[1:38:03] like what happened to all those other
[1:38:04] verses brother just don't worry about it
[1:38:06] they're still there but i want to skip
[1:38:08] to chapter 2.
[1:38:10] and in chapter 2 what god is doing is
[1:38:11] he's laying out a reason and a purpose
[1:38:13] for adam's existence
[1:38:15] kind of giving them a motive and
[1:38:16] objective to adam in genesis chapter 2
[1:38:18] verse 8 and the lord god
[1:38:20] planted a garden eastward in eden the
[1:38:23] word eastward actually speaks of in the
[1:38:24] beginning of eden god planted a garden
[1:38:28] in the beginning in eden eden means
[1:38:30] pleasure
[1:38:31] and again you see once again you see god
[1:38:33] foreshadowing a bride because a garden
[1:38:35] is indicative of a spouse and in the
[1:38:37] beginning god planted a garden in the
[1:38:39] beginning of eden god's delight god's
[1:38:42] pleasure and there he put the man whom
[1:38:44] he had formed so this is god's paradise
[1:38:47] this is god's pleasure
[1:38:49] and this place of god's paradise and
[1:38:51] god's pleasure is where he puts the man
[1:38:55] so he's giving man a
[1:38:56] place it wasn't just indiscriminate it
[1:38:59] wasn't just a a universe and kind of put
[1:39:01] man out there just kind of floating
[1:39:03] and the world he was just gonna have to
[1:39:04] bump into something or just kind of
[1:39:05] hurtling through the world he had to
[1:39:07] grab a hold of something or hope that
[1:39:09] gravitational forces placed him on the
[1:39:10] right planet with oxygen and everything
[1:39:12] it's not that there was billions of
[1:39:14] atoms floating through the the universe
[1:39:16] and some landed on mars and some landed
[1:39:18] on this and landed on that and this guy
[1:39:20] got lucky and landed in a place where
[1:39:21] there was actually oxygen god took the
[1:39:23] man and put him there intentionally
[1:39:26] now that might seem to be a little crazy
[1:39:28] the way i described it but that's really
[1:39:29] what the theory of evolution is is that
[1:39:31] just different uh
[1:39:33] cells won the lottery
[1:39:37] and given enough time in the billions
[1:39:39] and billions of years
[1:39:40] that you're going to produce
[1:39:42] complex human beings just like us
[1:39:44] because over a billion of years this
[1:39:46] cell actually something happened and
[1:39:47] mutated and popped out this and popped
[1:39:49] out that i guess that could give us
[1:39:50] enough faith to believe he put enough
[1:39:52] monkeys in a room with typewriters after
[1:39:53] a billion years they'll reproduce the
[1:39:55] works of shakespeare
[1:39:57] and that's how the evolutionists look at
[1:39:59] it
[1:39:59] but this is god with very deliberate
[1:40:01] intent and he takes the man that he
[1:40:04] created and he put him in his place
[1:40:06] and verse 15 and the lord god took the
[1:40:08] man
[1:40:09] and put him in the garden of eden again
[1:40:11] it's telling us this is man's place but
[1:40:14] now there's more than just this place to
[1:40:16] dress it and to keep it
[1:40:18] so god has not only given him a place
[1:40:20] but he's given him a purpose in that
[1:40:22] place
[1:40:23] and again he's to be in the image of god
[1:40:26] so he gives him a place a domain and now
[1:40:28] he's going to give him a purpose within
[1:40:30] it to dress the garden and to keep it
[1:40:33] and he is again remember in the express
[1:40:35] image of god amen
[1:40:37] and that in his
[1:40:39] uh
[1:40:41] he's going to be in the express image of
[1:40:42] god he also has a command in genesis 1
[1:40:44] uh 27 be fruitful multiply and replenish
[1:40:47] the earth he's given this command have
[1:40:49] dominion subdue multiply replenish
[1:40:52] fill up the earth he had this god had
[1:40:54] this these links and this uh space that
[1:40:57] humanity would fill up to and this is
[1:40:58] adam's command and the word adam comes
[1:41:01] from to call to mind or to remember
[1:41:04] because adam was to call to mind god
[1:41:07] adam on earth he had he had a duty to
[1:41:09] call to mind god he was going to act he
[1:41:11] was going to behave he was going to do
[1:41:12] things and in doing what adam was called
[1:41:14] to do it would call to mind the image of
[1:41:17] god and so he was to be fruitful
[1:41:19] multiply and replace the earth and in
[1:41:21] doing so he would call to mind the image
[1:41:23] of god he was to be in the garden to
[1:41:25] dress it and keep it he was to call to
[1:41:27] mind the image of god he was to subdue
[1:41:30] all creation and have dominion in doing
[1:41:32] so call to mind the image of god
[1:41:35] then in genesis chapter 2 verses 19 to
[1:41:38] 20
[1:41:39] it says that god caused from the ground
[1:41:41] to come up all animal life
[1:41:43] and he forms every beast of the field
[1:41:45] every fowl of the air and he brings
[1:41:47] animal life to adam and he says to see
[1:41:50] what he would call them
[1:41:52] i want you to recognize just how
[1:41:55] wonderful this creation is god creates
[1:41:57] the man he puts him in the garden that's
[1:41:59] his place now he gives them an objective
[1:42:01] to dress it and to keep it and now he
[1:42:03] brings animals to adam and he's not
[1:42:06] introducing the animals saying adam this
[1:42:08] is a giraffe adam this is a lion he
[1:42:10] brings these animals that god has
[1:42:12] created now he's created the fowl there
[1:42:14] he's created the animals and he brings
[1:42:16] them before adam and he wants to see
[1:42:18] what adam will name the animals
[1:42:21] and this is remarkable when you think
[1:42:22] about it because now he's put an adam in
[1:42:24] this place to recognize and to look at
[1:42:27] the characteristics of god's creation to
[1:42:29] look at how beautiful god had made them
[1:42:31] with their different uh the ways that
[1:42:33] they struck the eye and their
[1:42:34] characteristics and their height and
[1:42:36] their weight and whatever the attributes
[1:42:39] may have been and the bible says adam
[1:42:41] gave names to them
[1:42:43] so adam is looking at creation and he's
[1:42:46] discerning
[1:42:47] and there's a recognition of the
[1:42:49] difference of things
[1:42:50] god's created it sets it before adam and
[1:42:53] god doesn't tell adam what to say but he
[1:42:55] wants adam to think
[1:42:57] and to contemplate and to distinguish
[1:43:00] and give names to all the fouls of the
[1:43:01] air and all the animals
[1:43:03] there's a reasoning that's taking place
[1:43:05] he's using his mind he's using all the
[1:43:07] faculties that god had given them and
[1:43:10] recall that they're completely clear the
[1:43:11] channels are clear there's nothing else
[1:43:13] in there amen
[1:43:15] and so adam was acting deliberately in
[1:43:17] these scriptures according to the
[1:43:18] god-given purpose he had
[1:43:20] and it is in this that adam's life has
[1:43:23] meaning
[1:43:24] he's using the the
[1:43:26] the faculties that god had given them to
[1:43:28] discern the things of god the creation
[1:43:30] of god god given in this purpose to
[1:43:32] bring all animal life before him and
[1:43:33] he's to use his mind and and to think i
[1:43:36] want you to name this and adam gave them
[1:43:38] names it gives his life meaning
[1:43:41] and then shortly after this after the
[1:43:42] formation of the woman it's unique in
[1:43:44] that this
[1:43:45] story
[1:43:47] this retelling of adam naming the
[1:43:48] animals comes between god saying man
[1:43:50] shouldn't be alone and before he created
[1:43:52] the want to form the woman
[1:43:54] he inserts this detail of adam doing a
[1:43:57] work and doing things and using
[1:43:59] reasoning and contemplating and
[1:44:00] recognizing the difference in things
[1:44:02] before the woman came and it's
[1:44:04] reflective of things it's foreshadowing
[1:44:06] things there was a work that christ
[1:44:08] could do but there was also a work he
[1:44:09] couldn't finish until the bride came
[1:44:10] forth
[1:44:11] and so you see it reflected even in the
[1:44:13] creation of adam and the formation of
[1:44:15] the woman
[1:44:16] but after the formation of the woman
[1:44:19] humankind
[1:44:20] has now kind of set forth in their place
[1:44:24] with a meaningful life and with the gold
[1:44:27] we know that that promise to be fruitful
[1:44:28] multiplying replenish the earth was an
[1:44:30] oncoming promise so they're there in a
[1:44:32] beautiful eden a perfect condition the
[1:44:34] bible kind of ends the story in genesis
[1:44:36] 2 is saying the man and his wife are in
[1:44:38] this beautiful garden perfection of
[1:44:40] perfection and they were naked and not
[1:44:42] ashamed
[1:44:43] they were bare there was not there was
[1:44:45] not complexity there was not anxiety
[1:44:47] there was not dread there was no what's
[1:44:48] the future going to be like or what's
[1:44:50] going to happen if we do this this it's
[1:44:52] recognized in this state
[1:44:54] we're put here in a place that god wants
[1:44:56] us to be with a job that god wants us to
[1:44:58] do and they were perfectly happy
[1:45:02] but then genesis 3
[1:45:04] the fall seems to interrupt god's plan
[1:45:08] and it's at that moment that humanity is
[1:45:09] thrown into chaos
[1:45:11] and if i could put it this way kind of
[1:45:12] the meaningful life and the simple life
[1:45:14] that adam and the woman had is now
[1:45:16] chaotic it's now frustrated
[1:45:19] and their purpose becomes clouded
[1:45:21] and you find that in the in the curses
[1:45:23] that hardships are introduced pain is
[1:45:26] introduced sorrow is introduced there's
[1:45:28] a lot of things that now are introduced
[1:45:31] that never existed before
[1:45:33] i i believe that it must be
[1:45:36] very far from us to be able to
[1:45:38] comprehend
[1:45:39] what adam and the woman must have felt
[1:45:41] the moment they
[1:45:42] sinned to experience fear
[1:45:45] it would have been so foreign to them
[1:45:47] they're in the perfection of perfection
[1:45:50] no fear of death perfect love around
[1:45:52] them and all of a sudden there's this
[1:45:53] emotion that they've never experienced
[1:45:55] before something disconcerting and now
[1:45:57] there's this dread and this anxiety it
[1:45:59] was the result of sin
[1:46:01] and god says because of this there's
[1:46:03] pain and there's sorrow and what would
[1:46:04] have come easy to you adam is going to
[1:46:06] come very very hard
[1:46:08] all the ease of the garden all the
[1:46:10] simplicity of the garden all the all the
[1:46:12] things that were very clear
[1:46:14] and you could understand differences and
[1:46:15] all these animals you named now are
[1:46:17] going to become adversaries to you and
[1:46:19] you're going to struggle with the earth
[1:46:21] everything is turned upside down
[1:46:23] and brother brown makes a very peculiar
[1:46:25] statement about this he says and when
[1:46:27] satan had brought about so in genesis
[1:46:29] chapter three through the the uh use of
[1:46:32] the serpent
[1:46:33] when satan had brought about are you
[1:46:35] listening
[1:46:37] that which was necessary to the purpose
[1:46:39] of god
[1:46:42] he said then man could not get to the
[1:46:44] tree of life in the garden
[1:46:46] so he characterizes what happens in
[1:46:49] genesis chapter 3
[1:46:50] as that which was necessary to the
[1:46:52] purpose of god so god had a purpose he
[1:46:55] was very deliberate he's very
[1:46:56] intentional according to his own purpose
[1:46:57] the purpose of god the purpose of him
[1:46:59] the counsel of his own will the eternal
[1:47:00] purpose which he purposed in christ
[1:47:02] these are all things that were in god
[1:47:04] when he created and how he sets
[1:47:06] everything there in a beautiful eden in
[1:47:07] perfection and he puts them on a
[1:47:09] particular basis he gives them free
[1:47:11] moral agency and now the serpent comes
[1:47:14] in under the inspiration of satan and he
[1:47:16] seems to interrupt and frustrate
[1:47:18] everything but we're taught that the
[1:47:20] devil did that which was necessary to
[1:47:23] the purpose of god amen
[1:47:26] amen
[1:47:27] i believe it's in nominal christianity
[1:47:29] they essentially teach the creation
[1:47:30] story in the book of genesis as
[1:47:32] everything was perfect and also the
[1:47:34] devil messed it all up
[1:47:36] and that what happened next is god's
[1:47:38] response like god and the devil were
[1:47:39] playing chess
[1:47:41] and the devil made a move and god was
[1:47:42] like oh i had no idea that was going to
[1:47:44] happen so what should i do what should i
[1:47:46] do what should i do okay i know what
[1:47:47] i'll do now i'll send a sacrifice i'll
[1:47:50] send a son and then whoever believes on
[1:47:52] him can have salvation as if it was all
[1:47:54] an afterthought
[1:47:56] that god wasn't in the very beginning
[1:47:58] hadn't had it all planned out
[1:48:00] and and even designed satan in such a
[1:48:02] way because the lord said i behold i
[1:48:03] create good i create evil and satan
[1:48:06] after his own ambition oh how the wicked
[1:48:08] is ensnared in the works of his own
[1:48:10] hands the pit which he dug for me he's
[1:48:12] fallen into the midst of himself and
[1:48:14] here satan plays right into the hand of
[1:48:16] god because he did that which was
[1:48:18] necessary to the purpose of god
[1:48:20] [Applause]
[1:48:21] so this is very very key because i'm
[1:48:23] going to move on now
[1:48:25] to my next building block but this is
[1:48:26] very very key something about the fall
[1:48:29] was necessary to god's purpose
[1:48:32] all right so catch that something about
[1:48:33] the fall was necessary to god's purpose
[1:48:37] now i want to bring us back up to 2022
[1:48:39] now
[1:48:41] to where we are now
[1:48:43] and here you are
[1:48:45] existing thousands of years after these
[1:48:47] events
[1:48:49] far removed from this eden condition
[1:48:52] and now that i want you to be thinking
[1:48:54] about the time you're living in right
[1:48:55] now
[1:48:56] i want to use something that was written
[1:48:57] 3000 years ago
[1:49:00] to
[1:49:01] address the way you're feeling today
[1:49:05] and i would ask that you would let it
[1:49:06] search your heart
[1:49:08] as we read these things and though it
[1:49:09] may be written and i've chose just to
[1:49:11] read the king james version even though
[1:49:13] there's some other ones that might make
[1:49:15] it more readable and express in a
[1:49:16] certain way that might come out a little
[1:49:18] bit better but i want you as you hear
[1:49:19] this to compare it to your own
[1:49:21] experience even at your young age
[1:49:24] and i want to start with ecclesiastes
[1:49:25] chapter one
[1:49:27] and i want to start with verses one to
[1:49:29] three and we're just gonna i think we're
[1:49:30] just gonna kind of bounce through this
[1:49:32] going through different places
[1:49:33] and here's the words of the preacher the
[1:49:35] son of david king in jerusalem
[1:49:37] now we know this is solomon the wisest
[1:49:39] man in all the world
[1:49:41] and he introduces this book to us a
[1:49:43] vanity of vanities so that's one is to
[1:49:46] realize this is more than just vanity
[1:49:47] but it's vanity of vanities say at the
[1:49:49] preacher vanity of vanities not talking
[1:49:51] about furniture vanity of entities all
[1:49:54] is vanity
[1:49:55] what prophet hath man a man of all his
[1:49:58] labor which he taketh under the sun
[1:50:01] now this is our introduction to this
[1:50:02] book the words of the preacher verse two
[1:50:05] vanity of vanities vanity of vanities
[1:50:07] all is vanity the repetition to say it
[1:50:09] that five times vanity vanity vanities
[1:50:12] vanities vanity what profit hath a man
[1:50:15] of all his labor which he taketh under
[1:50:17] the sun vanity means it's empty it's
[1:50:19] futile it's meaningless it's worth
[1:50:22] chasing the wind anybody ever chase the
[1:50:24] wind
[1:50:25] you're not gonna catch it
[1:50:26] nothing's achieved in chasing the wind
[1:50:29] and what's happening is if i could just
[1:50:31] recall what i've expressed from genesis
[1:50:33] chapter one chapter one and two uh this
[1:50:36] is not this is not man's existence as it
[1:50:39] originally ought to have been
[1:50:41] this is not the original arrangement
[1:50:43] adam would have never said vanity of
[1:50:44] vanities vanity of vanities this is not
[1:50:47] how it was originally raised this is not
[1:50:48] uh what he was supposed to be but this
[1:50:50] is the present condition of creation
[1:50:52] even today
[1:50:53] the bible says in romans 8 20 that for
[1:50:55] the creation was made subject to vanity
[1:50:59] not willingly
[1:51:00] creation didn't do it willingly creation
[1:51:03] has been held in bondage because the
[1:51:05] vanity of man
[1:51:07] and by the fall of man here's creation
[1:51:09] it exists
[1:51:10] uh in perfection and it's master which
[1:51:13] was human and which was mankind the man
[1:51:16] and the woman they were there to serve
[1:51:18] and to be of use to the man and the
[1:51:20] woman
[1:51:21] and they were free but when men fell
[1:51:24] they were made subject to vanity not of
[1:51:26] their own will
[1:51:28] but by the failure of mankind so then
[1:51:30] think of just how much the creation is
[1:51:33] groaning to be released back released
[1:51:36] back to what back to the liberty of the
[1:51:38] sons of god
[1:51:40] all of creation is groaning to come back
[1:51:43] under the control and the dominion of
[1:51:45] the ones that let them be subject to
[1:51:47] vanity
[1:51:50] he says not willingly they're just made
[1:51:51] subject to vanity so the whole world is
[1:51:53] subject to vanity
[1:51:55] and he asked what does man really gain
[1:51:56] from all his work in life
[1:51:59] now if you're listening very
[1:52:01] diligently young people you might be
[1:52:02] able to find some uh useful arguments
[1:52:05] when your parents tell you to get a job
[1:52:08] you say well it is solomon who said
[1:52:12] rhetorically that you know what does a
[1:52:14] man really gain from work
[1:52:16] you know
[1:52:17] dad at the end of the day it's just it's
[1:52:19] money
[1:52:20] and the love of money is the root of all
[1:52:22] evil and i'm trying to keep myself
[1:52:23] sanctified here and i i want to stay
[1:52:25] holy
[1:52:26] i i don't want to and and so there might
[1:52:28] be if you just listen really hard
[1:52:30] you might get you might learn a few
[1:52:32] things
[1:52:34] but really this whole book examines this
[1:52:36] question what does a man get out of all
[1:52:37] his life
[1:52:39] and these are the observations of
[1:52:41] someone who's frustrated
[1:52:43] with the pursuit of meaning
[1:52:45] and i want to walk back through it
[1:52:46] because here's solomon who's in a pretty
[1:52:48] good position
[1:52:50] if money can buy you happiness if money
[1:52:52] can buy you love if if wisdom could get
[1:52:53] you peace and satisfaction here's a guy
[1:52:56] that we could go to is a test case say
[1:52:58] all right if there's somebody who could
[1:52:59] figure it out it would be solomon
[1:53:01] and so here's solomon expressing his
[1:53:03] frustrations after trying to find
[1:53:06] meaning after trying to find happiness
[1:53:08] and for him to say vanity of vanities
[1:53:11] and to repeat it vanity of vanities and
[1:53:13] then to say all is vanity asks the
[1:53:15] question what does man get out of life
[1:53:17] he's expressing the sentiment of
[1:53:19] hopelessness
[1:53:22] he said there's nothing gained from this
[1:53:24] there's nothing attained by it there's
[1:53:26] nothing grasped i can't take anything
[1:53:28] away from it there's nothing i can rely
[1:53:29] upon
[1:53:30] it's empty
[1:53:32] in other words he's having a crisis
[1:53:35] an existential crisis and saying this is
[1:53:37] absurd
[1:53:40] in ecclesiastes chapter 1 verses 13 to
[1:53:43] 15.
[1:53:44] now he is going to try to address the
[1:53:47] vanity of vanities or or we can say this
[1:53:49] is he's giving us the background how he
[1:53:51] can how he can make these conclusions i
[1:53:54] gave my heart to seek and search out by
[1:53:56] wisdom concerning all things that are
[1:53:58] done under heaven
[1:53:59] this sore travail hath god given to the
[1:54:02] sons of man to be exercised therewith
[1:54:04] i have seen all the works that are done
[1:54:06] under the sun and behold all is vanity
[1:54:09] and vexation of spirit
[1:54:10] let me save you the trouble young people
[1:54:13] if you're gonna try to go out into the
[1:54:14] world and find something that satisfies
[1:54:16] it's already told us someone sought it
[1:54:18] out for us and seen all the sore travail
[1:54:20] that god hath given the sons of men to
[1:54:22] be exercised with to be kept busy with
[1:54:24] to pursue and he says i've seen all the
[1:54:26] works all the occupations all the
[1:54:27] pursuits all everything that could be
[1:54:29] done and i've realized that all of it is
[1:54:32] vanity and vexation of spirit now i know
[1:54:34] what you're thinking you're thinking he
[1:54:36] never had fortnite
[1:54:39] i know what you're thinking that he
[1:54:40] never had the nostalgia of vine he never
[1:54:43] had he never knew what myspace was he he
[1:54:46] never knew a soundcloud rapper there's
[1:54:48] things about solomon that he just didn't
[1:54:51] get to enjoy that we get today right
[1:54:56] but he saw it all
[1:54:58] he says all his vanity and vexation of
[1:55:00] spirit
[1:55:01] that which is crooked cannot be made
[1:55:03] straight and that which is wanting
[1:55:04] cannot be numbered
[1:55:06] vexation is a striving it's a longing
[1:55:09] no satisfaction no fulfillment
[1:55:12] he's saying does this life even have
[1:55:13] purpose
[1:55:16] i guess if he was having a midlife
[1:55:18] crisis he would have went out and bought
[1:55:19] a a lamborghini or something
[1:55:23] but he's he's in this moment where he's
[1:55:24] like nothing nothing's bringing any kind
[1:55:26] of fulfillment in verse 15 when he says
[1:55:28] that which is crooked cannot be made
[1:55:29] straight that which is wanting cannot be
[1:55:31] numbered he's looking at all the
[1:55:33] inconsistencies
[1:55:35] all the anomalies
[1:55:38] that count that can't be accounted for
[1:55:40] listen solomon's saying that here's a
[1:55:42] wise man who's a man of means and here's
[1:55:45] somebody who could plan figure
[1:55:46] everything out and try to achieve a
[1:55:47] desired result he said i've noticed that
[1:55:50] when people set out to do things the
[1:55:51] crooked cannot be made straight and that
[1:55:53] which is wanting cannot be numbered i go
[1:55:55] out to do things and no matter how well
[1:55:57] i plan it doesn't always work out like i
[1:55:59] want it to and all the defects and all
[1:56:01] the detours and everything that happens
[1:56:03] they cannot be solved or fixed
[1:56:05] there's an incompleteness that we cannot
[1:56:07] remedy there are deficiencies as he says
[1:56:09] that which is wanting cannot be numbered
[1:56:10] there's deficiencies two number two too
[1:56:13] numerous to resolve
[1:56:16] i want you to put yourself in his shoes
[1:56:18] there might be things that you're
[1:56:19] thinking about if i could just do this
[1:56:22] dad if i could just do this i'll be
[1:56:24] happy
[1:56:25] if i could just get this off my bucket
[1:56:27] list if i could just have this
[1:56:29] opportunity i want to be able to go to
[1:56:30] europe i want to be able to get this
[1:56:31] degree i just i just want to achieve
[1:56:33] this and there's things that we begin to
[1:56:34] think that this is the source of my
[1:56:36] emptiness this is the source of my
[1:56:38] longing
[1:56:38] daddy you've always kept me from having
[1:56:40] a boyfriend i've never been able to date
[1:56:41] who i want i like this guy he's a good
[1:56:43] boy if i could just if you just let me
[1:56:45] this one time date him i think he'll
[1:56:47] turn out to be a good boy he told me
[1:56:49] that he loves two corinthians
[1:56:51] and he's read the book of job and
[1:56:52] there's things about him that i think
[1:56:54] are real there's some really good things
[1:56:55] in there if you just let me do this i
[1:56:57] think this is satisfying the emptiness
[1:56:59] and the longing i have
[1:57:01] this is these are the things that
[1:57:02] solomon is raising
[1:57:04] so it gets even more interesting in
[1:57:06] chapter two because solomon describes
[1:57:07] his efforts to satisfy himself so after
[1:57:10] he has done this i've looked at
[1:57:11] everything i've examined everything i've
[1:57:12] seen the sword travel i've seen a man
[1:57:13] work in labor and try to pursue things
[1:57:15] and you know what even in his earnest
[1:57:16] desires to achieve things and to gain
[1:57:18] income and to accomplish something it's
[1:57:20] vanity it's all he says vanity and
[1:57:22] vexation it's a hopelessness it's a
[1:57:24] despair
[1:57:27] it's draining
[1:57:29] it's killing them
[1:57:31] so he's like you know what i'm going to
[1:57:32] do
[1:57:33] i'm going to pursue i'm going to pursue
[1:57:35] all the luxuries of life
[1:57:37] in order to give life fulfilling purpose
[1:57:39] he says in the beginning of chapter 2 i
[1:57:41] said in my heart go to now i will prove
[1:57:43] thee with mirth therefore enjoy pleasure
[1:57:45] and behold this also is vanity
[1:57:48] i'm just going to have fun
[1:57:51] i'm going to seek out pleasure i'm going
[1:57:52] to say shake the fleshy desires i'm
[1:57:53] going to enjoy things that make me feel
[1:57:55] good i'm going to pursue it and
[1:57:57] certainly in doing this this will give
[1:57:59] me the satisfaction and solomon says
[1:58:00] nope it's still vanity
[1:58:02] work hard and
[1:58:04] and get a job and get a degree and make
[1:58:06] them money and and do this and be be
[1:58:08] have fidelity in your job that'll give
[1:58:09] you real happiness someone's like no
[1:58:11] tried it
[1:58:13] so it's like all right then just live
[1:58:15] eat drink be merry party do everything
[1:58:17] you can
[1:58:18] and that'll give you happiness no donna
[1:58:20] this is also vanity
[1:58:22] uh tell me how many of you can check
[1:58:23] these off the box well maybe not because
[1:58:25] the first ones enjoy wine so we won't we
[1:58:27] won't go there
[1:58:30] uh
[1:58:32] does he mention vaping or anything in
[1:58:33] here
[1:58:37] he uh he's enjoyed wine he built houses
[1:58:40] he planted gardens planted vineyards and
[1:58:42] planted orchards and trees made pools
[1:58:45] obtained servants and maidens had great
[1:58:47] possessions of cattle gathered silver
[1:58:49] gold unique treasures he got singers
[1:58:50] musical instruments and entertainers
[1:58:53] he paid for the spotify premium
[1:58:57] he didn't just use the six month trial
[1:58:59] of apple music he went all in and bought
[1:59:02] a lifetime license to title
[1:59:06] he got he had
[1:59:07] he had vip access to all the music he
[1:59:10] had he had a studio in-house he got the
[1:59:12] first
[1:59:14] cuts he invented the soundcloud rapper
[1:59:20] and so here he is saying i've tried
[1:59:22] everything i can i've had every genre
[1:59:24] i've ever beat i've had every lick i've
[1:59:26] had every riff i've heard at all i've
[1:59:27] had them all at my disposal i've had
[1:59:29] entertainers i've had music i've had
[1:59:31] movies i've had drama i've had fashion
[1:59:33] i've had it all he still says
[1:59:35] listen what he says in verse nine so i
[1:59:36] was great and increased more than all
[1:59:38] that were before me in jerusalem
[1:59:41] i want you to just see this pattern here
[1:59:43] he says also my wisdom remained with me
[1:59:44] and he wants you to know he didn't
[1:59:46] become a madman
[1:59:49] so so he he knows
[1:59:51] that those of us in this day and age
[1:59:53] like solomon just lost his mind
[1:59:57] because if i could
[1:59:58] do that i'd be happy
[2:00:02] but he says no
[2:00:03] no i still had my wisdom
[2:00:05] and whatsoever my eyes desired i kept
[2:00:07] not from them i withheld not my heart
[2:00:09] from any joy for my heart rejoiced in
[2:00:11] all my labor and this was my portion of
[2:00:13] all my labor here he is saying i have
[2:00:15] the means i'm going to go get it i'm
[2:00:16] going to get it while i can i'm going to
[2:00:17] enjoy it he says then i looked on all
[2:00:19] the works that my hands had wrought
[2:00:21] remember everything in verses 2 to 8
[2:00:24] and on the labor that i had labored to
[2:00:25] do and behold all was vanity and
[2:00:28] vexation of spirit and there was no
[2:00:31] prophet under the sun
[2:00:34] he enjoyed all the pleasures of the
[2:00:35] flesh
[2:00:37] yet he was still left unsatisfied in the
[2:00:39] end
[2:00:41] and all of it he never found meaning
[2:00:43] none of it never clicked
[2:00:45] there was nothing that he enjoyed that
[2:00:46] ultimately there might have been
[2:00:48] something in the moment where he's like
[2:00:49] this is it yeah that i like that this is
[2:00:52] it i'm going to enjoy this
[2:00:54] this is what this is what's going to
[2:00:55] give me meaning and then after a while
[2:00:57] he's like nope that's not it
[2:00:59] it started out with a lot of promise i
[2:01:01] thought this is what i was hunting i
[2:01:02] thought maybe that could finally put my
[2:01:04] finger on say this is it but he never
[2:01:06] found meaning in any of it none of it
[2:01:08] ever kind of gave him a reason to exist
[2:01:10] oh i can't wait to get down to the
[2:01:12] studio to hear the next track i can't
[2:01:13] wait to hear the new singers i can't
[2:01:15] wait to count all my gold i can't wait
[2:01:16] to swim in my pools i can't wait to pick
[2:01:18] the fruit from the trees none of it gave
[2:01:20] him reason
[2:01:22] he says in verse 15 then i said in my
[2:01:24] heart as it happeneth to the full so it
[2:01:26] happened even to me
[2:01:32] maybe in his wisdom he thought you know
[2:01:33] what
[2:01:34] everyone who's miserable are just
[2:01:35] foolish
[2:01:37] and the reason why the fool can't find
[2:01:39] happiness in these things is because
[2:01:40] he's he's a fool
[2:01:42] so perhaps if i can
[2:01:44] uh with wisdom obtain these things then
[2:01:48] i'll be happy so then he says as it
[2:01:50] happened to the full it happened to me
[2:01:52] so he says why was i then more wise
[2:01:55] how am i any wiser than anybody else
[2:01:56] that if what happens to the fool happens
[2:01:58] to me then i said in my heart that this
[2:02:00] also is vanity
[2:02:02] even solomon's wisdom had not kept him
[2:02:05] from vanity
[2:02:06] even in solomon's wisdom it had not kept
[2:02:08] him from sorrow so he comes to the
[2:02:10] conclusion
[2:02:11] this is where i i'm hoping that it kind
[2:02:13] of begins to speak to your hearts and i
[2:02:16] and i realize this as much as we want to
[2:02:18] be able to preach a sermon that every
[2:02:19] single person likes and enjoys
[2:02:22] and touches on every person's needs i i
[2:02:24] realize tonight that it could be phrased
[2:02:26] in such a way just to save one person
[2:02:29] and it's worth every
[2:02:30] effort
[2:02:32] but it comes to this spot in verse 17
[2:02:34] therefore i hated life
[2:02:37] because the work that is wrought under
[2:02:38] the sun is grievous
[2:02:40] it's distressing
[2:02:42] it's injurious unto me for all is vanity
[2:02:46] and vexation of spirit
[2:02:50] this is the richest man in the world
[2:02:51] this is the wisest man in the world
[2:02:54] so
[2:02:55] you know just to trigger some people
[2:02:56] this is jeff bezos and elon musk
[2:02:58] combined
[2:03:00] you could figure out who the wise one is
[2:03:06] but this is the richest
[2:03:08] and wisest man
[2:03:10] in other words
[2:03:11] this is this is somebody who's earnest
[2:03:13] and sincere he's wise he's wealthy he's
[2:03:16] gonna he's gonna go before us and figure
[2:03:17] things out
[2:03:21] it doesn't get any better than this guy
[2:03:24] the wisdom came from the lord he's from
[2:03:26] a righteous lineage he's a king of a
[2:03:28] king of israel it doesn't get any better
[2:03:30] but yet in everything there's so much
[2:03:32] grief there's so much hopelessness he
[2:03:34] comes to the point where he says i hate
[2:03:36] living
[2:03:39] i hate life i'm not excited to get up in
[2:03:41] the morning i i'm not finding ambition
[2:03:43] and motive i'm sick of all of living i'm
[2:03:46] sick of life everything that i have
[2:03:48] including my own wisdom leaves me empty
[2:03:50] in the end everything's vanity of
[2:03:52] vanities this is the despair of the
[2:03:54] wealthiest man this is the despair of
[2:03:56] the wisest man this is the despair of
[2:03:58] the man who can have anything he wanted
[2:03:59] in the flesh and he says i'm depressed
[2:04:01] i'm miserable i don't want to live
[2:04:03] anymore
[2:04:06] well that escalated quickly
[2:04:08] i know we're all thinking now great
[2:04:09] what's what's the hope for me i'm living
[2:04:11] i'm going to leave depressed
[2:04:14] and you know he really does perfectly
[2:04:16] describe the emptiness of human
[2:04:17] existence after the fall
[2:04:20] the wrestling of us you say we're 20 22.
[2:04:23] i just read to you what very well could
[2:04:25] have been your diary yeah sure no matter
[2:04:28] what age you are as you become to more
[2:04:30] begin to get more conscious of life even
[2:04:32] if the inequality of outcomes for you is
[2:04:34] the fact that you do something and you
[2:04:35] get punished but your little brother
[2:04:36] doesn't you begin to realize life isn't
[2:04:38] fair this is ridiculous i don't like
[2:04:41] school this is how does this happen why
[2:04:43] does that happen and we get we're
[2:04:44] getting trapped in a society to where
[2:04:46] it's almost like there's nothing we can
[2:04:47] do
[2:04:49] all right
[2:04:50] there's no place we can go there's
[2:04:51] nothing we can say where it's not like
[2:04:53] well you better be careful there you
[2:04:54] better be careful there oh you better be
[2:04:55] very careful about that and so it's like
[2:04:57] we're living in such a tense anxious
[2:04:59] time
[2:05:01] i mean everybody you're like
[2:05:03] no ma'am sir
[2:05:04] you know
[2:05:05] you don't know what to say anymore
[2:05:11] i did point out the other day in genesis
[2:05:12] 1 that god used the they them
[2:05:15] in creating man and woman
[2:05:20] in the inequality of outcomes and the
[2:05:23] the the inconsistencies and experience
[2:05:26] because people say i did this i did that
[2:05:27] it was wonderful we try to do it
[2:05:29] we're miserable
[2:05:32] that was one of the things about
[2:05:33] instagram is you take a picture of food
[2:05:35] and it looks like i want to do that
[2:05:36] where was that they tell you where it is
[2:05:38] and you go eat it's like that tastes
[2:05:39] awful
[2:05:42] could we not have some kind of essence
[2:05:44] app that kind of we can just
[2:05:45] upload it it can tell us it looks good
[2:05:48] tastes bad
[2:05:50] is the way i can apply the filter to my
[2:05:52] taste buds
[2:05:56] and what it does it's frustration
[2:05:58] it's disappointment
[2:06:00] the more often you're disappointed the
[2:06:02] more you begin to anticipate
[2:06:03] disappointments
[2:06:05] and it's designed so that we we we begin
[2:06:08] to lower our expectations and we do that
[2:06:10] with life we do that with other people
[2:06:11] we do with family members and we've
[2:06:13] subconsciously done it when it comes to
[2:06:14] church we subconsciously done it when we
[2:06:17] come to the word of god and the promises
[2:06:18] of god were like oh yeah that was a
[2:06:20] boast that was a brag this was going to
[2:06:21] be good this was going to be great and
[2:06:23] then you begin to hear things in the
[2:06:24] word of god and in your mind
[2:06:25] subconsciously without putting the
[2:06:26] pieces together you expect to be
[2:06:28] disappointed even by the supreme
[2:06:34] so in ecclesiastes chapter 8 verses 14
[2:06:36] to 17
[2:06:38] it just keeps getting dark so i you know
[2:06:40] i apologize but i'm just quoting solomon
[2:06:43] d.j solomon thank you
[2:06:45] he said there's a vanity which is done
[2:06:47] upon the earth that there be just men
[2:06:50] under whom it happeneth according to the
[2:06:52] work of the wick in other words these
[2:06:53] are just men but what happens this is
[2:06:54] the vanity done in the earth good men do
[2:06:57] things and they get the fruit of the
[2:06:58] wicked
[2:06:59] again there be wicked men to whom it
[2:07:01] happeneth according to the work of the
[2:07:02] righteous do you realize what he's
[2:07:04] saying
[2:07:05] bad things happen to good people and bad
[2:07:06] people good things happen to them they
[2:07:08] said this isn't fair this isn't right
[2:07:10] why is this happening this shouldn't be
[2:07:12] happening he says this is vanity he says
[2:07:13] uh he says according
[2:07:15] he says and i said
[2:07:17] to this
[2:07:19] this also is vanity
[2:07:22] he said there's no apparent reason or
[2:07:24] justice in life events
[2:07:27] solomon the wisest man in the world sees
[2:07:29] a righteous man endure wicked things and
[2:07:32] he can't say oh let me tell you why this
[2:07:33] happened
[2:07:35] he can't do it he can't figure it out
[2:07:37] then he sees a wicked man be blessed and
[2:07:38] he says hold on let me tell you why it
[2:07:40] happened he looks and says this is
[2:07:41] vanity
[2:07:43] there's no explanation for this
[2:07:45] then i command commanded mirth because a
[2:07:47] man hath no better thing under the sun
[2:07:49] than to eat and to drink and to be merry
[2:07:50] for that shall for that shall abide with
[2:07:53] him of all his
[2:07:54] with him of his labor in the days of his
[2:07:56] life which god giveth him under the sun
[2:07:57] so just go ahead and enjoy yourself
[2:07:58] enjoy the fruits of your labor eat drink
[2:08:01] be merry this will abide with you all
[2:08:02] the days of your life he says when i
[2:08:04] applied my heart to no wisdom and to see
[2:08:06] the business that is done upon the earth
[2:08:08] for also there is that neither day nor
[2:08:10] night seeth sleep with his eyes then i
[2:08:12] beheld all the work of god
[2:08:14] that a man cannot find out the work that
[2:08:17] is done under the sun
[2:08:19] because though a man labored to seek it
[2:08:21] out yet he shall not find it
[2:08:23] yea further though a wise man think to
[2:08:25] know it yet shall he not be able to find
[2:08:27] it
[2:08:28] the more he labors the less he receives
[2:08:32] the less he seeks the more he seeks the
[2:08:34] less he finds and it was over and over
[2:08:37] and over again he's saying
[2:08:39] i
[2:08:40] can't
[2:08:41] find satisfaction
[2:08:43] none of it satisfies me
[2:08:45] and the end what i think is going to
[2:08:47] make it click in the end the thing
[2:08:48] that's going to do it for me it's out of
[2:08:50] my reach
[2:08:52] over and over and over again a man
[2:08:54] cannot find out the work that is done or
[2:08:56] the son though a man labored to seek it
[2:08:58] out he can never find it the wise man
[2:09:00] think to know it he'll not be able to
[2:09:01] find it
[2:09:02] he's talking about the empty promises of
[2:09:04] the world
[2:09:05] the empty promises of entertainment the
[2:09:07] empty promises of social media the empty
[2:09:10] promises of technology the empty
[2:09:11] promises of fashion
[2:09:13] i think you could be uh relate to this
[2:09:15] the empty promises of sports
[2:09:18] we think that if the gamecocks could
[2:09:20] just finally win a national championship
[2:09:22] right
[2:09:23] like the somehow in getting the ring and
[2:09:25] getting the championship it's just gonna
[2:09:27] it's gonna be great but what what are
[2:09:28] they immediately talking about after
[2:09:29] they win
[2:09:30] we're going to do it next year and it
[2:09:32] starts all over again and then as soon
[2:09:34] as they're not ranked in the top 10 the
[2:09:36] next year yeah i don't know about this
[2:09:37] guy and i don't know about this i don't
[2:09:38] know about that and they need to fire
[2:09:39] the code and you're just right back in
[2:09:40] the grind again why because the trophy
[2:09:42] the championship the ring it didn't
[2:09:44] solve anything it's temporary it's
[2:09:47] fleeting
[2:09:48] and and the same thing happens with
[2:09:50] respect to fashion
[2:09:52] i want to look a certain way i want to
[2:09:53] dress a certain way i want to do a
[2:09:54] certain thing and you finally get you
[2:09:56] finally got the outfit you finally got
[2:09:57] the look and got everything and then you
[2:09:59] show up to the youth meeting and some
[2:10:00] other sister's got a better fit on than
[2:10:02] you and
[2:10:04] i knew it
[2:10:07] i knew that sister was going to do it
[2:10:11] i need to get a better subscription to
[2:10:12] these things i need to follow better
[2:10:14] people on on instagram because i just i
[2:10:17] shouldn't have been beat at this and
[2:10:18] what it's an endless pursuit you're
[2:10:19] never happy
[2:10:21] because what happens is listen i realize
[2:10:23] that i'm kind of getting into there
[2:10:24] should we dismiss the parents
[2:10:28] that
[2:10:29] we get into this cycle where we think oh
[2:10:31] i'm going to be able to achieve i want
[2:10:32] to do this i want to do this and you
[2:10:34] just set your up to where you have to do
[2:10:35] it again
[2:10:37] but you can't do the same thing you got
[2:10:38] to do it better
[2:10:40] well why don't you just wear that no i
[2:10:42] wore that two years ago
[2:10:44] right
[2:10:45] why don't you just do this no we already
[2:10:46] did that before like because there's
[2:10:48] this you enter into this cycle that
[2:10:50] somehow i'm going to achieve a certain
[2:10:52] level that's going to satisfy me
[2:10:54] and it's the empty promises of sports
[2:10:56] and fashion and entertainment i hope you
[2:10:59] recognize what the world's trying to do
[2:11:00] to you through whether it be the tick
[2:11:03] tocks or the the youtube shorts or all
[2:11:05] the different things on netflix and all
[2:11:06] the movies and all the tv shows they
[2:11:08] always have a hook that wants to keep
[2:11:10] you coming back for more they're always
[2:11:12] wanting to leave you in suspense so that
[2:11:14] you're never actually satisfied the the
[2:11:16] the the plot is never fully satisfied
[2:11:19] they want to leave you hanging for a
[2:11:20] sequel i hope you realize that what the
[2:11:22] devil's doing is he's trolling all of
[2:11:24] you
[2:11:26] he's the ultimate troll we're all being
[2:11:28] trolled by the devil
[2:11:29] [Applause]
[2:11:33] and he gets you all set up and then he
[2:11:35] just ghosts you
[2:11:43] and then you get mad at him and he just
[2:11:44] starts to gaslight you
[2:11:47] and he blames you
[2:11:51] none of these things you're going to
[2:11:52] pursue young people are going to placate
[2:11:53] your anxiety
[2:11:55] let me tell you right now some of you
[2:11:56] anxious sisters
[2:11:58] the very things that you're trying to do
[2:12:00] to satisfy your anxiety is causing your
[2:12:02] anxiety
[2:12:02] [Applause]
[2:12:04] brothers the very thing you're afraid of
[2:12:06] and you're trying to outrun
[2:12:08] and you're pursuing are the very things
[2:12:09] that are causing your fear
[2:12:14] the very pain you're trying to cure
[2:12:16] with the things you're seeking out are
[2:12:18] the things causing the pain
[2:12:24] can i just keep quoting solomon
[2:12:27] verse chapter 9 verse 11 i returned and
[2:12:30] saw unto the son that the race is not to
[2:12:32] the swift this is frustrating
[2:12:35] right because you're the fastest brother
[2:12:36] right
[2:12:37] but you never win your race
[2:12:40] nor the battle to the strong you're the
[2:12:41] prettiest sister but you never get all
[2:12:42] the attention
[2:12:44] neither yet bread to the wise nor yet
[2:12:46] riches to the men of understanding or
[2:12:47] yet favor to the men of skill it never
[2:12:50] quite works out the way that we think
[2:12:51] that it should
[2:12:53] the fastest doesn't win the race the
[2:12:54] strongest doesn't win the battle the
[2:12:56] wise don't get the bread the riches
[2:12:58] aren't just to the men of understanding
[2:13:00] and neither do the does the favor go to
[2:13:02] the men of skill
[2:13:05] he says time and chance happened to them
[2:13:07] all right
[2:13:08] i know his life is random
[2:13:11] how can any of this he said how can any
[2:13:13] of this be meaningful how can any of
[2:13:14] this be permanent do you realize it's
[2:13:17] remarkable when you think about the the
[2:13:19] cycle that we're in how there's so many
[2:13:21] celebrities and superstars they get very
[2:13:23] rich and they get our attention but
[2:13:24] where are they now
[2:13:27] where did the where the views of the
[2:13:29] followers and the monies and the
[2:13:30] millions where is it now
[2:13:32] they burn out so quickly and we move on
[2:13:33] to new ones
[2:13:36] that's why i don't name names because
[2:13:38] you would i would be dating myself we
[2:13:40] don't know what that is
[2:13:43] why because they were they they were
[2:13:44] superstars 10 years ago they were
[2:13:46] superstars 10 weeks ago i mean you could
[2:13:49] if
[2:13:49] if a minister sat down and tried to
[2:13:51] figure out the hashtags and all the
[2:13:52] lingo and then they start to use it now
[2:13:54] they'd be like
[2:13:58] that like
[2:13:59] that's like january stuff bro
[2:14:02] i mean we're not even
[2:14:03] we've moved on from that
[2:14:07] that's why it's just better to be
[2:14:08] vintage right
[2:14:10] [Applause]
[2:14:16] these
[2:14:20] i had some other things i wanted to read
[2:14:21] in ecclesiastes but i think i'll move on
[2:14:24] i'm getting depressed
[2:14:27] solomon's beating me down like oh my
[2:14:29] goodness
[2:14:30] solomon
[2:14:32] but these are the observations of a wise
[2:14:34] man
[2:14:35] he recognizes the disharmony in life
[2:14:38] you might be fast but you're not going
[2:14:39] to win
[2:14:40] you might be strong but you're not going
[2:14:42] to win you might be wise but you're not
[2:14:43] going to get all the bread
[2:14:46] you might you might have understanding
[2:14:47] but you're not going to get all the
[2:14:48] riches
[2:14:49] you might be the best you might be
[2:14:50] skilled but you're not the one that's
[2:14:51] going to get all the attention
[2:14:53] not going to get the credit not going to
[2:14:54] get the promotion not going to get the
[2:14:55] favor he says time and chance happens to
[2:14:57] all of them that no matter what you have
[2:14:59] chance could happen
[2:15:01] time happens
[2:15:02] he says all this he's recognizing the
[2:15:04] incongruity of things and all the the
[2:15:05] confusion that comes with it and so i
[2:15:08] want to back up to chapter seven
[2:15:10] ecclesiastes chapter 7 verse 29 this
[2:15:12] will kind of uh
[2:15:14] kind of begin to leave
[2:15:16] solomon's estimations but if i could
[2:15:18] maybe just do a checkup with you
[2:15:20] i asked you to consider 2022
[2:15:23] and use the words of a man from nearly 3
[2:15:24] 000 years ago
[2:15:26] would you agree that he's describing
[2:15:28] life today
[2:15:30] he may be using a little bit of
[2:15:31] different lingo but he's describing life
[2:15:34] today it makes this observation kind of
[2:15:37] in the very middle of the book lol this
[2:15:39] only have i found
[2:15:42] now to me i feel like this this when he
[2:15:43] says this only have i found this is the
[2:15:45] wisdom of solomon coming back and and
[2:15:47] you can i want you to look at this as
[2:15:48] kind of being the point at which we can
[2:15:50] view everything before and after
[2:15:52] everything he said in chapter one two
[2:15:53] everywhere we've read where now this is
[2:15:55] kind of becomes this uh this
[2:15:58] spoken this will in the middle that we
[2:16:00] can begin to look out and everything
[2:16:01] says this only have i found this is the
[2:16:03] explanation that god hath made man
[2:16:05] upright
[2:16:06] god made him to be righteous
[2:16:08] but they have sought out many inventions
[2:16:12] now this isn't a dis on edison
[2:16:14] uh or tesla
[2:16:16] this isn't a diss on inventors
[2:16:19] he's saying that men have sought out
[2:16:20] many inventions i want to kind of break
[2:16:22] that down a little bit
[2:16:23] but solomon attributes all the vanities
[2:16:26] in life and all the frustrations of life
[2:16:28] to the fall
[2:16:29] because in the beginning god made man in
[2:16:31] his image he made him pure he made him
[2:16:33] righteous he made him holy he was not
[2:16:35] mixed with evil
[2:16:37] there was no there was no white dog and
[2:16:39] black dog are we allowed to use that
[2:16:40] analogy anymore
[2:16:42] i'm sorry there there was no two
[2:16:44] different breeds in his heart that one
[2:16:45] was evil and one was good
[2:16:47] and this one was good if he just fed it
[2:16:49] and this one was bad he had to starve it
[2:16:51] he didn't have that in his heart
[2:16:53] he was pure he was not mixed with evil
[2:16:55] at all god made man puris what he said i
[2:16:57] found that god in the beginning made man
[2:16:59] pure but now mankind is defiled now
[2:17:01] mankind is mixed he's misguided he's
[2:17:04] saying man by mixing himself with
[2:17:06] endless things has become vain
[2:17:09] having lost the holy image he's now
[2:17:11] endlessly searching for fulfillment and
[2:17:13] he's endlessly trying to find something
[2:17:15] to kind of give him that spark and give
[2:17:17] him that meaning but he can't find it
[2:17:19] this is a kind of a i think it was a
[2:17:21] translation
[2:17:22] of these verses he says i discovered the
[2:17:24] fountain of all vanity and evil it is in
[2:17:27] the original sin
[2:17:28] that has corrupted the nature of man
[2:17:31] god gave adam
[2:17:32] god made adam and the woman without
[2:17:34] imperfection in likeness likeness of his
[2:17:37] own desire in nature but the woman not
[2:17:39] content anymore with her present
[2:17:41] condition accepted a new way of making
[2:17:43] herself wise
[2:17:45] ever since all mankind is prone to
[2:17:48] forsake the order of god's word and has
[2:17:51] sought new methods to attain fulfillment
[2:17:53] and happiness
[2:17:55] this is what solomon is saying right in
[2:17:57] the middle of the book he says this is
[2:17:58] what i figured out that god made man a
[2:18:00] particular way but man by mixing himself
[2:18:03] he has sought out many inventions
[2:18:06] that means calculations opinions
[2:18:07] imaginations valuations he's devised so
[2:18:10] many ways so many different views so
[2:18:12] many different disciplines so many
[2:18:13] different belief systems to resolve
[2:18:15] vanity
[2:18:16] a way of viewing things a way of
[2:18:18] pursuing things the way to give
[2:18:19] perspective to things a way to deal with
[2:18:21] loss a way to deal with ambition a way
[2:18:23] to deal with death a way to rationalize
[2:18:25] and figure out the world it's a way to
[2:18:26] try to placate the fear and the anxiety
[2:18:28] and the dread that comes with looking at
[2:18:30] the world it's meaningless it's absurd
[2:18:32] things aren't working out the way that
[2:18:33] they're supposed to do he said god made
[2:18:35] men upright but they meddle with endless
[2:18:38] questions
[2:18:40] endless anxieties
[2:18:42] and everything solomon proposes from the
[2:18:45] first chapters to the very ends turns on
[2:18:47] this verse
[2:18:48] in other words man is not living the way
[2:18:50] god intended them to live
[2:18:52] god has an order god has a purpose sin
[2:18:55] there's a way that god made man but now
[2:18:57] man has sought out many inventions in
[2:18:58] other words he's living outside of god's
[2:19:00] original order therefore it's all vanity
[2:19:03] frustration and confusion outside of the
[2:19:05] original way it's all vanity and
[2:19:07] confusion
[2:19:08] amen
[2:19:11] are some of you following me so far
[2:19:15] and i can say this this is the work of
[2:19:16] satan
[2:19:17] this is what this is what satan has
[2:19:19] caused
[2:19:20] all the chaos all the confusion is the
[2:19:22] climax of his eden
[2:19:25] if you think solomon had it bad it's the
[2:19:27] same today
[2:19:28] if not amplified and multiplied it's the
[2:19:31] same today
[2:19:34] civilization education leads to death
[2:19:36] and chaos
[2:19:37] we're at the climax of it
[2:19:39] death and chaos
[2:19:41] i saw an article a couple years ago and
[2:19:43] the title was great it said this within
[2:19:45] the article
[2:19:47] grappling with the world has to be more
[2:19:48] complicated for kids than it's ever been
[2:19:53] and i i would say myself myself included
[2:19:56] i can't relate completely to what you
[2:19:57] are having to go through
[2:19:59] just with the political pressure you
[2:20:01] face the social pressure you face all
[2:20:03] all the isms that exist all the
[2:20:05] movements
[2:20:07] everything that you got to be careful of
[2:20:09] that you can't offend this you can't
[2:20:10] offend that you've got to be careful
[2:20:11] about this you've got to be careful
[2:20:12] about that
[2:20:13] and there's no they the very ones that
[2:20:16] advocate for safe places have made
[2:20:18] nothing safe
[2:20:22] i mean even if we went out today and
[2:20:23] said you know what we believe women
[2:20:24] should have equal opportunity they'd be
[2:20:26] like are you assuming people's gender
[2:20:29] but sorry i'll burn the signs
[2:20:33] there's always somebody that's going to
[2:20:34] be offended
[2:20:37] and there's such a bully culture that we
[2:20:38] live in
[2:20:40] that everyone is worried and they're
[2:20:41] recognizing this this is a complicated
[2:20:43] time for for young people because it's a
[2:20:46] question of where do i belong
[2:20:49] where how do i fit in and who who do i
[2:20:51] relate to and who understands me and
[2:20:53] there's a way that we can begin to feel
[2:20:55] even within ourselves and i'm speaking
[2:20:57] to you individually i may be speaking to
[2:20:59] one person right now that you feel
[2:21:01] within yourself or your thought patterns
[2:21:02] and your thought process and you think
[2:21:04] about this you know well there might be
[2:21:05] something to that then you hear this
[2:21:06] other person's response well that
[2:21:08] doesn't seem very right and you hear
[2:21:09] this and you hear that and you begin to
[2:21:11] feel as if i don't know if anybody else
[2:21:12] around me thinks the way i do or feels
[2:21:14] the way i do and i'm afraid to say
[2:21:16] something i'm afraid to ask a question i
[2:21:18] feel in my heart that perhaps the things
[2:21:20] that i'm seeing and the things i'm being
[2:21:22] taught in the way that i want to go is
[2:21:24] really what's right for me but there's a
[2:21:25] lot of other things that are clouding
[2:21:27] the issue but if i raise the question if
[2:21:29] i bring something up then i know this
[2:21:30] might happen that might happen and we
[2:21:32] kind of are getting beat into this
[2:21:33] quietness we're being beat into the
[2:21:35] submissiveness not yielding ourselves to
[2:21:37] the things of god but just yielding us
[2:21:39] to the pressure of satan's eating
[2:21:44] and it's our minds our minds are just
[2:21:46] being bombarded over and over and over
[2:21:48] again
[2:21:50] we hear
[2:21:51] we we hear something and we go well that
[2:21:53] that sounds
[2:21:55] that sounds reasonable that sounds good
[2:21:56] but then tucker carlson comes along and
[2:21:58] he spews out some other things like well
[2:22:00] maybe not and i don't know and all that
[2:22:02] well that's oh no my goodness oh man
[2:22:04] we're just vacillating back and
[2:22:06] forth unsure about this unsure about
[2:22:09] that not knowing which way to turn i i
[2:22:11] would say that anybody who's in public
[2:22:13] school today you've got to be walking on
[2:22:15] eggshells
[2:22:18] you're holding your breath all day long
[2:22:21] ram said in the message communion
[2:22:23] december 12 1965 these are some of the
[2:22:24] last words he wants to leave with us he
[2:22:26] says we can also look around and see
[2:22:27] that the way that the human mind is
[2:22:29] leaving the people
[2:22:31] this world is insane
[2:22:34] absolutely insane it's the only way that
[2:22:36] describes the current political climate
[2:22:38] it's the only way that cur describes the
[2:22:40] uh the current woke-ism that exists it's
[2:22:43] the only thing that describes the reason
[2:22:44] why people have their platitudes and
[2:22:46] their reasonings and their rationale
[2:22:48] the inconsistencies in their positions
[2:22:50] the inconsistencies and what they lift
[2:22:52] up and support and some of the things
[2:22:53] that they say we believe in this we
[2:22:54] believe in that but then the very things
[2:22:56] that they lift up on this one side
[2:22:57] undermines their belief system on
[2:22:59] another
[2:23:01] and and then and they've lost their
[2:23:03] minds because they can't even recognize
[2:23:05] the the inconsistencies
[2:23:09] we believe in tolerance and we will not
[2:23:10] tolerate the intolerant
[2:23:12] right
[2:23:15] i'm sick and tired of people who don't
[2:23:17] have the love of god right
[2:23:19] it's like
[2:23:20] wait a minute what does that even mean
[2:23:25] he says we can't stay too much longer
[2:23:27] we've been a complete insane institution
[2:23:30] the whole world will be so we're at the
[2:23:32] end time
[2:23:33] the human mind is leaving the people the
[2:23:36] the condition that solomon diagnosed in
[2:23:39] ecclesiastes is prophetic to where now
[2:23:40] the entire world has access to whatever
[2:23:43] they want to have we can do whatever we
[2:23:44] want to achieve we've the
[2:23:47] the pinnacle of science has not placated
[2:23:49] man's fears the pinnacle of politics has
[2:23:51] not removed differences we've we've come
[2:23:53] to the very best that humankind has to
[2:23:55] offer and it's only created more fear
[2:23:57] more anxiety more depression
[2:24:01] i wanna i'm gonna read a statement
[2:24:03] and i realize now i don't have the
[2:24:04] proper attribution this is not
[2:24:06] plagiarism i just don't have the correct
[2:24:07] source i'm reading somebody else
[2:24:10] and if you could um i think this would
[2:24:12] be good for parents to listen to i'd
[2:24:14] even say ministers to listen to but
[2:24:16] young people i want you to recognize
[2:24:17] this and i'll also say this i know i'm
[2:24:20] not informing you of anything
[2:24:23] i don't think there's any young people
[2:24:24] sitting here today go never thought of
[2:24:25] that right you know where you live but
[2:24:28] the purpose of sharing this is so that
[2:24:30] you realize god's interested
[2:24:33] god knows
[2:24:34] this is the statement teen pregnancy and
[2:24:36] alcohol cigarette and drug use have
[2:24:38] fallen
[2:24:39] because these are some of the things
[2:24:40] that may be maybe if we went to losing
[2:24:42] louisiana youth camp in the 80s this is
[2:24:44] the things we would have heard priest
[2:24:45] against right rock and roll and alcohol
[2:24:46] and cigarettes and
[2:24:48] and these different things he says but
[2:24:50] pregnant teen pregnancy alcohol
[2:24:52] cigarette and drug use have fallen
[2:24:54] while anxiety depression suicide and
[2:24:56] self-harm have soared
[2:24:59] i wanted to recognize like teen
[2:25:00] pregnancy you're going to know
[2:25:01] eventually right
[2:25:04] cigarette use and drugs and alcohol
[2:25:06] these are things that can be done
[2:25:07] off-site
[2:25:09] but now it says anxiety depression and
[2:25:11] suicide and self-harm these are things
[2:25:13] that can be covered up
[2:25:15] in 2019 the american academy of
[2:25:17] pediatrics issued a report noting that
[2:25:19] mental health disorders have surpassed
[2:25:21] physical conditions as the most issues
[2:25:24] causing impairment and limitation among
[2:25:26] adolescents
[2:25:28] it's not physical things that are
[2:25:29] impairing our young people it's
[2:25:30] spiritual things
[2:25:32] mental health disorders have surpassed
[2:25:34] physical ailments physical things of
[2:25:36] drug addictions and pregnancies and
[2:25:38] fornications and indulgences of the
[2:25:40] flesh it's now mental anxieties and
[2:25:42] depression he says and the the writing
[2:25:45] says in december the u.s surgeon general
[2:25:47] in a rare public advisory warned of a
[2:25:50] devastating mental health crisis among
[2:25:52] american teens
[2:25:55] what is it's a despairing of life
[2:25:58] i mean for some of us we might be
[2:25:59] thinking as a parent you know we want to
[2:26:01] make sure that there's there's no drug
[2:26:03] paraphernalia we want to be sure that
[2:26:04] our children aren't fornicating we will
[2:26:07] be sure there's no alcohol and you can't
[2:26:08] be going to keg parties and don't be
[2:26:10] running off to the movies and
[2:26:12] and we're we want all these safeguards
[2:26:14] want to be sure our children aren't
[2:26:15] doing these physical things that are
[2:26:16] going to defile their body but the world
[2:26:18] we're realizing now that's not the
[2:26:19] problem anymore
[2:26:22] this isn't where young people are
[2:26:23] struggling amen we could get up here and
[2:26:26] rail all day long about cigarette use
[2:26:28] and preach against cigarettes and the
[2:26:29] evils of cigarettes and a lot of the
[2:26:30] young people like i need to ask my mom
[2:26:32] what those are
[2:26:36] right
[2:26:37] i mean rail against
[2:26:39] watching videotapes or something
[2:26:42] and you kids with your cds and your
[2:26:44] cassettes of led zeppelin
[2:26:47] and you're eight tracks of philip well i
[2:26:49] was gonna create this clear water
[2:26:50] revival you guys need to get saved
[2:26:53] and you'd be like
[2:26:54] who's merle haggard i don't even have
[2:26:56] any i don't know what you're talking
[2:26:58] about
[2:27:00] these are the things that young people
[2:27:01] are struggling with
[2:27:03] and to say that they've surpassed the
[2:27:05] physical conditions this is a despairing
[2:27:07] of life
[2:27:09] why is it why is it that they've ceased
[2:27:11] into these the fornicating and the drugs
[2:27:13] and the alcohol and those things because
[2:27:15] we've learned there's no fulfillment in
[2:27:17] those things
[2:27:18] we've learned it doesn't bring the
[2:27:20] satisfaction it doesn't give the
[2:27:21] enjoyment that's not where you fight
[2:27:23] it's not where it clicks so subsequent
[2:27:26] generations are learning it didn't do it
[2:27:27] for them
[2:27:28] so they're searching out other things to
[2:27:30] find happiness and we're starting to
[2:27:32] near the end of the road and as young
[2:27:34] people are saying generation after
[2:27:36] generation has lived they've sought out
[2:27:38] joy they've sought out happiness we now
[2:27:40] have everything at our fingertips we
[2:27:42] have everything at our disposal and it's
[2:27:44] still not making me happy i'm not they
[2:27:46] don't find it in sex they don't find it
[2:27:48] in drugs they don't find it in all these
[2:27:49] other things and therefore it's leading
[2:27:51] to a mental health crisis
[2:27:54] while we're suffering without meaning
[2:27:56] wow that's what despair is is to suffer
[2:27:59] without purpose
[2:28:02] there's an elevation of anxiety
[2:28:05] there's an elevation of depression
[2:28:09] it's a struggle for life amongst youth
[2:28:14] i i want this to be somewhat
[2:28:15] enlightening for somebody today
[2:28:18] that
[2:28:21] that weight
[2:28:23] that you wake up with in the morning
[2:28:29] that pit in your stomach
[2:28:33] that melancholy
[2:28:36] that blue feeling
[2:28:38] it's what this world has put on you
[2:28:42] of no choice of your own
[2:28:48] and there's a struggle for life amongst
[2:28:50] our young people
[2:28:53] i and i really feel the scariest part of
[2:28:55] your struggle
[2:28:57] it's not as obvious as the generation
[2:28:58] before you
[2:29:03] there's a you just don't have to back up
[2:29:05] very far and like i said whether it be
[2:29:07] teen pregnancy and alcohol and cigarette
[2:29:09] and drug use
[2:29:11] there was a time when the young people
[2:29:13] it was evident who struggled
[2:29:17] it was evident who was struggling
[2:29:19] but now the struggles are below the
[2:29:21] surface
[2:29:24] and the things that you're wrestling
[2:29:25] with aren't as obvious as it was in your
[2:29:27] parents
[2:29:30] the struggles of the youth today
[2:29:32] aren't
[2:29:33] aren't what strikes the eye but it's
[2:29:35] things in the heart
[2:29:37] the isolation that you feel the
[2:29:39] loneliness that you experience it's like
[2:29:40] well how are we alone you're in whatsapp
[2:29:42] groups and you have everyone around you
[2:29:43] but yet we're alone together and the
[2:29:45] frequency with which we can communicate
[2:29:47] and all the things that we can follow
[2:29:48] and others follow us it's only causing
[2:29:50] further isolation
[2:29:52] you think really in this day and age
[2:29:53] i've got so many friends i've got so
[2:29:55] many contacts i've got so many people
[2:29:56] messaging me and it never brings the
[2:29:58] satisfaction and young people are
[2:29:59] experiencing a loneliness epidemic and
[2:30:01] pandemic within themselves they don't
[2:30:02] feel connected even though they're
[2:30:04] connected in so many different ways
[2:30:07] it brings a dread
[2:30:10] one thing to consider and again i might
[2:30:11] say that i could be stating the obvious
[2:30:13] and it might be things that are very
[2:30:14] apparent to our to our parents
[2:30:17] uh
[2:30:18] but there's i think there's a dad joke
[2:30:20] in there
[2:30:22] when does a joke become a dad joke
[2:30:24] when it becomes apparent
[2:30:30] did you get that son did you get that
[2:30:36] my sons are cringing
[2:30:40] that this might this might be more
[2:30:42] informative to the adults
[2:30:45] but you're
[2:30:46] you have a young people have a private
[2:30:48] ecosystem that they operate within
[2:30:51] that that essentially never strikes the
[2:30:53] eye
[2:30:55] but it's available to them 24 7.
[2:30:58] there's no terminal in the kitchen that
[2:31:00] everyone goes to to check their email
[2:31:02] and and we hear the dial up they get on
[2:31:03] juno and they download their email and
[2:31:05] then when they're done we can go check
[2:31:06] and see what they read anything now they
[2:31:08] can take their devices and in the
[2:31:09] privacy of their room they have their
[2:31:11] own ecosystem that can be hid that can
[2:31:12] be turned off that can be shuttered it
[2:31:14] can be closed off that could even be
[2:31:16] can be walled off from anything that we
[2:31:18] try to access and see
[2:31:20] and young people exist within a private
[2:31:22] ecosystem that's where they're
[2:31:24] communicating that's where they're
[2:31:25] feeding that's where they're interacting
[2:31:27] and maybe it sounds like i'm talking
[2:31:28] beyond you but i'm talking to you for
[2:31:30] you to recognize we're living our lives
[2:31:33] within particular environments that are
[2:31:34] having an impact on our emotional health
[2:31:36] having an impact on our wants and our
[2:31:38] desires our ambitions and our pursuits
[2:31:40] and just be honest with yourself today
[2:31:42] whether or not you're finding your vibe
[2:31:46] whether or not you're really finding
[2:31:47] that this is good i like this this is
[2:31:49] happiness this is true joy and take a
[2:31:51] step back and give an honest look as to
[2:31:53] how much is deteriorating your joy your
[2:31:56] happiness your ambition and just how
[2:31:59] little you're getting out of that
[2:32:00] private life
[2:32:02] there's some of us that are living false
[2:32:04] lives we have different names different
[2:32:06] avatars different social lives different
[2:32:09] forums different apps different things
[2:32:10] that we're living within and it's a
[2:32:12] completely different existence than the
[2:32:14] one our families seeing the people at
[2:32:16] church see
[2:32:17] [Music]
[2:32:18] amen
[2:32:22] all right i'll move on
[2:32:26] i want to bring this to a close that's
[2:32:28] just a generic reference
[2:32:31] but humanity went from genesis chapter 2
[2:32:33] naked and not ashamed bare simple no
[2:32:36] fear no anxiety no worry about the
[2:32:39] future
[2:32:41] to ecclesiastes 2 17. therefore i hated
[2:32:45] life
[2:32:47] why
[2:32:49] what's the reason
[2:32:51] simple we can save the fall
[2:32:53] this is exactly what solomon said i this
[2:32:55] is what i figured out god made man right
[2:32:58] god made man holy he made him upright
[2:33:00] but then he sought out so many different
[2:33:01] inventions
[2:33:04] so many different he's mixed himself
[2:33:05] with endless things this is what's
[2:33:07] created the anxiety within mankind
[2:33:09] what is this what is this result of the
[2:33:11] works of satan
[2:33:12] this is what he began in the beginning
[2:33:15] but remember
[2:33:17] it was necessary to god's purpose
[2:33:20] isn't that remarkable
[2:33:22] it was necessary to god's purpose so
[2:33:24] brother bannon makes this statement
[2:33:26] god being a savior
[2:33:29] it was necessary that he predestined a
[2:33:31] man
[2:33:32] who would require salvation
[2:33:34] now this is this is inerrant in this is
[2:33:37] inherent in god this is part of his
[2:33:39] essential nature and character he is a
[2:33:41] savior and he creates a man and a woman
[2:33:43] who are perfect in a perfect eden and
[2:33:46] there's a mystery to god that can never
[2:33:47] be expressed
[2:33:49] in that condition man and the woman
[2:33:51] could have lived eons and eons in terms
[2:33:53] of time they could have lived for an
[2:33:55] eternity and the god that created them
[2:33:57] in the perfection they were experiencing
[2:33:59] with the perfect love of god around him
[2:34:01] they would have never understood the
[2:34:03] full mystery of god
[2:34:05] because he was a savior
[2:34:08] and in order to be a savior he had to
[2:34:09] predestinate a man who would require
[2:34:11] salvation and listen i know you know the
[2:34:13] phrase in order to give himself
[2:34:16] reason and purpose of being
[2:34:20] that god himself i want you to catch
[2:34:22] just how deep this is the lonely god in
[2:34:25] the beginning
[2:34:26] himself longed for something else
[2:34:29] that would satisfy his deepest desire
[2:34:33] and he would never find it in his
[2:34:34] eternal power he would never find it in
[2:34:37] his endless strength he could never find
[2:34:39] it in his supreme knowledge he was gonna
[2:34:41] find it in you
[2:34:44] hallelujah the very god of creation and
[2:34:46] eternity it was necessary to bring you
[2:34:49] forth
[2:34:55] hallelujah
[2:34:56] [Applause]
[2:34:57] just to think that that man is walking
[2:34:59] in the same pattern and god could even
[2:35:01] look up and say i can relate to that
[2:35:04] step like that anxiety in a sense that
[2:35:07] longing and that passion and that
[2:35:09] neediness and god said i've created jill
[2:35:12] to satisfy my heart desire i've created
[2:35:16] jail to satisfy that missing peace and
[2:35:19] it gave he says it gave god reason and
[2:35:22] purpose to be
[2:35:26] that god without you has no reason to
[2:35:29] exist
[2:35:30] [Applause]
[2:35:31] that the eternal god without you has no
[2:35:33] purpose in existing
[2:35:36] that god that god had to have you
[2:35:39] in order to have motivation
[2:35:42] that's what reason it's motive
[2:35:45] motivation and purpose objective
[2:35:48] so now god then has a motivation and a
[2:35:50] goal
[2:35:51] god himself had a reason and purpose of
[2:35:53] being that's existence
[2:35:56] god because god is the one that feels
[2:35:58] all time and space the god that existed
[2:36:00] beforehand he had to have a reason to be
[2:36:06] god had a reason that motivated his
[2:36:07] existence that gave meaning to his his
[2:36:10] life his zoe
[2:36:13] therefore just as god had a reason to
[2:36:14] exist we must find our reason to live
[2:36:17] amen
[2:36:18] and what i've described to you today
[2:36:20] this evening
[2:36:21] are
[2:36:22] the works of satan
[2:36:25] and so in first john chapter 3 verse 8
[2:36:27] he that committeth sin is of the devil
[2:36:30] for the devil sinneth from the beginning
[2:36:32] for this purpose the son of god was
[2:36:34] manifested so it's coming back to reason
[2:36:36] god had a purpose god had a purpose god
[2:36:37] a purpose for this purpose was the son
[2:36:40] of god manifested that he might destroy
[2:36:42] the works of the devil
[2:36:46] the things that solomon describes in
[2:36:47] ecclesiastes are only limited remedy
[2:36:49] through jesus christ amen because it's
[2:36:52] through christ that the works of the
[2:36:53] devil are destroyed
[2:36:56] are you catching that i'm just making it
[2:36:57] very simple for you it's through christ
[2:36:59] that the works of the devil are
[2:37:01] destroyed your anxiety your depression
[2:37:03] your melancholy your temptations your
[2:37:05] dissatisfaction uh your your uh
[2:37:08] your addictions and even your
[2:37:10] dependencies and the relationships where
[2:37:12] there's a tendency in young men to get
[2:37:14] very possessive and jealous and pursue
[2:37:16] things endlessly they become they become
[2:37:18] stalkers they become
[2:37:20] unable to be satisfied they've got to
[2:37:22] pursue something sisters likewise can
[2:37:24] get that way these dependencies and
[2:37:26] these sensations and these things we try
[2:37:27] to achieve these are all the works of
[2:37:29] the devil there's only one that can
[2:37:30] destroy that hold on you that's jesus
[2:37:33] christ
[2:37:34] [Applause]
[2:37:35] brother adam says if they don't accept
[2:37:37] god's provided comforter then they have
[2:37:39] to get some other comforter because you
[2:37:42] can't live without something to live for
[2:37:45] you can't live without something to live
[2:37:47] for and so it's in you it's part of you
[2:37:50] to try to seek some purpose to try to
[2:37:51] seek out some meaning and to try to find
[2:37:54] something in your life whether it be a
[2:37:56] relationship or an accolade or a pursuit
[2:37:58] i want something to give me meaning and
[2:38:00] if you forsake god's provided comforter
[2:38:03] you'll try to find something else to
[2:38:04] live for
[2:38:07] i'm trying to hurry i'm going going a
[2:38:09] little bit long i apologize
[2:38:12] i think i left myself two extra hours
[2:38:14] last night so i think technically i got
[2:38:16] five hours tonight
[2:38:17] if that's how it works nobody say
[2:38:19] anything
[2:38:21] ecclesiastes chapter 12. we're just
[2:38:23] coming to the conclusion verse one
[2:38:24] remember now thy creator in the days of
[2:38:25] that youth
[2:38:27] this is solomon's conclusion
[2:38:29] this is he's coming to the end of it
[2:38:30] we've worked through several passages
[2:38:33] and so now he's going to impart to us
[2:38:34] wisdom after looking at everything and
[2:38:35] realizing life it cannot be remedied by
[2:38:38] pursuing things the flesh we i cannot
[2:38:40] wisdom will not satisfy it a a working
[2:38:43] won't do it and pre in music confessions
[2:38:45] and all these things it'll never satisfy
[2:38:47] so what does he do he speaks to young
[2:38:48] people says remember the lord
[2:38:51] and he uses the language that i think
[2:38:52] that wants to clue you in remember now
[2:38:54] thy creator
[2:38:57] it's not just the lord not just remember
[2:38:59] god not remember elohim he wants to
[2:39:00] bring it all the way back to the
[2:39:02] beginning
[2:39:03] before he even begin to reveal his name
[2:39:06] to abraham before he begin to reveal
[2:39:07] himself to the people which was part of
[2:39:09] the plan of redemption he wants to bring
[2:39:11] you all the way back to the beginning
[2:39:12] remember now thy creator
[2:39:15] in the days of thy youth
[2:39:18] do it when you're young
[2:39:21] and he comes to verse 13 let us hear the
[2:39:23] conclusion of the whole matter fear god
[2:39:24] and keep his commandments for this is
[2:39:26] the whole duty of man amen
[2:39:28] i i'm just wanting to quickly reference
[2:39:30] this he brings it back to the beginning
[2:39:33] why because this is the only thing that
[2:39:34] can remedy the curse
[2:39:37] it's the only thing that speaks to the
[2:39:38] confusion
[2:39:39] remember god in the days of you come to
[2:39:42] know him early on
[2:39:44] recognize his intent and his purpose see
[2:39:46] that he in the beginning had a reason
[2:39:48] and purpose of existence and it had
[2:39:50] something to do with you
[2:39:52] it was disobedience to the word that uh
[2:39:54] and leaving god's purpose that brought
[2:39:56] the fall
[2:39:57] so the only way back is through coming
[2:39:59] to god's purpose again
[2:40:00] amen
[2:40:02] social
[2:40:04] social things will never do it right
[2:40:07] social connections your education will
[2:40:09] never do it politics will never do it
[2:40:11] science will never do it
[2:40:13] there's a lot of things we could try to
[2:40:15] pursue
[2:40:16] if i if i could say it here
[2:40:18] there's there's no essential oil that's
[2:40:20] going to figure it out for you
[2:40:21] [Music]
[2:40:23] you can burn all the ear cones you want
[2:40:25] in your ear to pull all the wax out and
[2:40:27] it's not going to help you in this
[2:40:30] we could get a lavender tattoo on the
[2:40:32] bottom of our big toe and it's not going
[2:40:34] to bring us the peace we crave
[2:40:38] there's only one way you can find peace
[2:40:40] and fulfillment in this chaotic age
[2:40:42] let's do an experience with the word
[2:40:46] brother madam writes this in the church
[2:40:47] age book he says what can help
[2:40:50] only one thing is needful return to
[2:40:52] christ
[2:40:54] look into christ as the only leader and
[2:40:55] walking in his footsteps setting aside
[2:40:57] all other ways
[2:40:59] until we reach the
[2:41:00] goal and have come to the unity of the
[2:41:03] faith
[2:41:04] as the heavenly master built everything
[2:41:06] on the ground of the scriptures so
[2:41:07] should we
[2:41:08] leave all particularities of our special
[2:41:10] confessions
[2:41:12] and be satisfied with the revealed word
[2:41:14] of god which belongs to us all amen
[2:41:17] this revealed word belongs to you young
[2:41:18] people
[2:41:19] with the bible in our hand we should cry
[2:41:22] i believe what god has revealed in this
[2:41:24] book
[2:41:26] i will obediently keep his commands
[2:41:29] i hope for that which he has promised
[2:41:32] but the bible in our hands he says this
[2:41:34] ought to be our cry i believe what god
[2:41:37] has revealed in this book i will
[2:41:38] obediently keep his command i hope for
[2:41:40] that which he has promised he says
[2:41:41] christians give ear there's only one
[2:41:43] life but death comes to us in a thousand
[2:41:45] forms
[2:41:46] there's only one christ but a thousand
[2:41:48] antichrist so thou knowest o christendom
[2:41:51] what is the one thing needful either
[2:41:52] thou turn us back to christ or thou goes
[2:41:54] to the destruction like the antichrist
[2:41:56] if thou art wise and will live follow
[2:41:59] the leader of life
[2:42:01] i know it seems very very simple but
[2:42:03] that's all i'm proposing to you to young
[2:42:04] people today is there's only one answer
[2:42:06] to all the anxiety there's only one
[2:42:08] answer to all the fear there's only one
[2:42:10] answer to the things you struggle with
[2:42:11] it's christ
[2:42:12] amen
[2:42:14] it is through christ that you'll find a
[2:42:15] reason to live
[2:42:18] follow the leader of life only one thing
[2:42:20] is needful set it aside all the ways
[2:42:22] until we reach the goal
[2:42:24] there's only one life but death comes in
[2:42:26] a thousand forms only one christ but a
[2:42:28] thousand antichrist
[2:42:31] as i want to draw this to a close
[2:42:38] i i
[2:42:39] i know that it may seem dark
[2:42:42] and uh hopeless
[2:42:44] in your life again there might be some
[2:42:46] of you that think you're just killing it
[2:42:47] right now and you're living your best
[2:42:48] life
[2:42:50] and so maybe it's not apparent to you
[2:42:52] right now what your needs are
[2:42:55] there's another condition that is
[2:42:57] becoming more and more evident amongst
[2:42:58] young people is we're just numb
[2:43:02] we experience so much disappointment and
[2:43:04] hurt that we want to numb ourselves to
[2:43:06] the pain of our personal interactions
[2:43:09] and the side effect is since we want to
[2:43:10] numb ourselves to pain we numb ourselves
[2:43:13] to joy
[2:43:14] we numb ourselves to other experiences
[2:43:16] and it makes it harder for us to feel
[2:43:18] the presence of god it makes it harder
[2:43:19] for us to feel him
[2:43:21] wooing our hearts why because we've
[2:43:23] become so defensive and so numb we
[2:43:25] become so calloused
[2:43:28] some of us are just really dead
[2:43:31] we're dead inside we're struggling to
[2:43:33] live
[2:43:38] but maybe perhaps
[2:43:41] at some point for the last two services
[2:43:43] something
[2:43:44] was said
[2:43:46] and there was a light
[2:43:48] that blinked inside of you
[2:43:50] maybe something at some point through
[2:43:52] everything that's being said as you were
[2:43:53] kind of sitting there thinking yeah
[2:43:55] these are just these are the same tropes
[2:43:57] that every preacher rolls out this is
[2:43:59] just some another you know dad in his
[2:44:01] 40s trying to be cool whatever it might
[2:44:02] be but all of a sudden something said
[2:44:04] you're like huh
[2:44:06] maybe there's something inside of you
[2:44:08] like a little light
[2:44:10] like some kind of spark
[2:44:12] for a moment it gave you hope
[2:44:16] my title tonight is declared faith so i
[2:44:18] just laid a foundation i'm like to
[2:44:19] preach now
[2:44:23] declared faith
[2:44:25] why because there's a gene of life
[2:44:26] inside of you
[2:44:28] it's crying out inside of you but so
[2:44:31] many things cover it up
[2:44:33] so many things
[2:44:35] are around it but every once while
[2:44:37] something something gets through
[2:44:39] and it sparks something it creates a
[2:44:41] little bit of a hunger
[2:44:42] and so i believe that there's a gene of
[2:44:44] life on the inside of you
[2:44:46] and as we mentioned last night about a
[2:44:48] deliberate faith i i move it into this
[2:44:50] realm of a declared faith that a faith
[2:44:53] is made clear
[2:44:54] a faith that is made known
[2:44:57] a faith that expresses itself a faith
[2:45:00] that that it makes an announcement
[2:45:03] and and i'm just very quickly coming to
[2:45:05] the thrust and i've even tried to
[2:45:07] preserve uh myself whether it be in my
[2:45:10] voice
[2:45:12] and my in my mind and my energy to bring
[2:45:14] it to this place where we can express it
[2:45:16] to you tonight that if there's a spark
[2:45:19] if there's a life
[2:45:21] if it's if it's moved just even the
[2:45:23] slightest bit if it's kicked just a
[2:45:25] little bit
[2:45:26] if it's the least desire
[2:45:28] then there's more in that than the world
[2:45:30] can offer
[2:45:32] there's more power in that than anything
[2:45:34] in the world today
[2:45:36] one of the one of the biggest lies that
[2:45:38] satan has told the young people is that
[2:45:40] your little desire for god is weaker
[2:45:43] than your great desire for the world but
[2:45:45] the truth is the smallest teeniest
[2:45:48] tiniest bit of desire for christ is
[2:45:50] greater than every addiction every love
[2:45:53] every lust every want
[2:46:04] so
[2:46:05] when i say declared faith what is what
[2:46:08] struck my heart
[2:46:09] is there there's a it's a moment right
[2:46:11] now where you you want it to declare
[2:46:14] you want it to speak you want it to act
[2:46:16] you want it to move
[2:46:18] and the moment of the momentum of the
[2:46:20] meetings and the moment of the presence
[2:46:21] of god the very thing that seems so far
[2:46:24] out of reach for you some of you thought
[2:46:26] i could never do it i'll never do it
[2:46:27] it'll always be out of reach because
[2:46:29] when i tried before i failed but now you
[2:46:31] come right back to the same place again
[2:46:33] and you're afraid to move because you
[2:46:35] don't want to fail
[2:46:38] and it's the devil lying to you
[2:46:39] [Applause]
[2:46:41] it's a time to make your faith known to
[2:46:43] express it
[2:46:44] hallelujah
[2:46:46] it's god by the preaching of the word
[2:46:48] just comes and he touches you yeah and
[2:46:50] he finds some spot in your heart and he
[2:46:53] touches it and you know it's him you
[2:46:55] know he's touched you you know it's
[2:46:56] something beyond yourself you know it's
[2:46:58] something that's discerning your life
[2:46:59] you know it right now that god has come
[2:47:01] in and he's just touched you and in that
[2:47:04] moment when you're touched he wants you
[2:47:05] to answer back to him
[2:47:09] it's a declaration of faith
[2:47:12] is that not what repentance is
[2:47:14] not when he touches you that's sovereign
[2:47:17] that's god godly sorrow leadeth a man to
[2:47:20] repentance you never led yourself to
[2:47:21] repentance it's god that does it so
[2:47:24] what's the what's the declaration i've
[2:47:26] been pricked in my heart i repent of my
[2:47:29] sins you've declared faith
[2:47:33] amen
[2:47:34] what is water baptism
[2:47:37] it's declared faith
[2:47:40] that when you know that your sins have
[2:47:41] been forgiven
[2:47:43] then there's this declaration like
[2:47:45] what's the whole point getting wet
[2:47:46] what's the whole point it's an outward
[2:47:48] sign that you know your sins have been
[2:47:50] forgiven
[2:47:51] that's why if you when the bible even
[2:47:53] says that it's all according to your
[2:47:54] belief and according to your faith is it
[2:47:56] believeth and is baptized they shall be
[2:47:58] saved but it says he that believeth not
[2:48:00] is lost it doesn't even talk about
[2:48:01] baptism why because it's rooted in the
[2:48:03] faith a man who has truly believed and
[2:48:05] know he's repented even post seal of god
[2:48:08] will go to the water as a declaration of
[2:48:10] faith that their sins have been forgiven
[2:48:13] amen
[2:48:14] and i miss you in a challenge tonight
[2:48:17] if god has spoken to your heart respond
[2:48:21] if he's reached into you somewhere and
[2:48:22] touched
[2:48:23] respond
[2:48:25] we closed last night in first kings 19.
[2:48:27] god just supernaturally took that right
[2:48:29] back into my notes i'd had it in my
[2:48:30] notes i took it out earlier this week i
[2:48:31] thought it's too much and then i thought
[2:48:33] maybe i'll get to it saturday night and
[2:48:34] i'd already had my notes for saturday
[2:48:35] night done i realized they weren't even
[2:48:36] in there and i'm like well maybe i won't
[2:48:37] get to elisha at all god said i don't
[2:48:39] need to take everything else out put
[2:48:40] this back in
[2:48:42] why because you're that you're you're
[2:48:44] you can see yourselves in elisha
[2:48:48] elisha
[2:48:50] he's just he's just minding his own
[2:48:52] business
[2:48:53] right
[2:48:54] he's just going to youth weekend
[2:48:57] he's just plowing just playing
[2:48:58] volleyball
[2:48:59] just enjoying himself and all of a
[2:49:00] sudden a mantle is thrown on him
[2:49:03] it's going about everyday life and a
[2:49:04] mantle comes on him and in that moment
[2:49:06] that this mantle comes on him he's
[2:49:08] touched
[2:49:09] so he he kind of he kind of moves a
[2:49:11] little bit and he tells elijah i'm going
[2:49:13] to go back and say goodbye to everybody
[2:49:15] and elijah's just like fine go back to
[2:49:17] the plow
[2:49:19] let's go back to the plow
[2:49:21] and it's then that the seriousness and
[2:49:23] the soberness of this mantle strikes
[2:49:24] elisha
[2:49:26] and he realizes
[2:49:28] i've got to declare my faith
[2:49:31] i've got to abandon the plow i have no
[2:49:32] more backs up i have no more
[2:49:33] contingencies and he acted on it
[2:49:37] tonight if you felt the mantle what's
[2:49:38] your move
[2:49:41] brother brahman says we can preach to
[2:49:43] our horse and our lungs fall out
[2:49:46] until the people make a move you'll
[2:49:48] never do nothing
[2:49:49] amen
[2:49:51] i mean it's not the preacher
[2:49:53] because he can preach until he's hoarse
[2:49:55] and his lungs fall out
[2:49:56] i think he's being figurative there
[2:49:59] he says you'll never do nothing
[2:50:01] that's you got to make them move and
[2:50:03] believe it
[2:50:04] he says brethren do it tonight do it
[2:50:05] tonight stand up for the word stand for
[2:50:07] the living word of the living god god
[2:50:09] will manifest it
[2:50:11] and always there's a part that you have
[2:50:13] to do i've it was january 5th of this
[2:50:16] year that god gave me everything i'm
[2:50:18] sharing with you tonight i've been
[2:50:20] thinking about this for over five months
[2:50:22] under the weight of it under the
[2:50:23] pressure of it and knowing this was thus
[2:50:25] saith the lord to you tonight and now
[2:50:27] i've delivered it and i've done all i
[2:50:29] can but you've got to move
[2:50:32] there's a moment at which the mantra is
[2:50:34] laid upon you the minister's priesthood
[2:50:37] the mantle's been delivered but now
[2:50:39] you've got to do something and i'm
[2:50:41] telling you right now if you move god
[2:50:43] will manifest it
[2:50:48] musicians if you could come
[2:50:55] some of you just think very deeply now
[2:50:58] i know it's a unique way of ministry i
[2:51:00] realize that
[2:51:02] but i trust that god's finding you
[2:51:05] touching you working around your
[2:51:06] complexes
[2:51:09] getting to that spot to where you know
[2:51:11] he's talking to you
[2:51:14] i want to i want to use something
[2:51:17] and i hope that this
[2:51:20] i hope that this can touch
[2:51:22] touch the real heart now
[2:51:27] and the neonatal intensive care units
[2:51:30] just for the
[2:51:31] newly born
[2:51:34] i want to use this image now in the
[2:51:35] medical terminology that there is a
[2:51:38] there's a phrase that they use when
[2:51:40] babies are born
[2:51:42] very premature
[2:51:44] or or with life-threatening
[2:51:46] complications
[2:51:48] and so at the moment of the
[2:51:49] when a baby's born they could have very
[2:51:51] terrible complications life-threatening
[2:51:52] complications and just by all
[2:51:54] appearances it looks as if this baby is
[2:51:57] more than likely going to die or babies
[2:51:59] that are born so premature
[2:52:01] that the likelihood of survival is very
[2:52:02] very remote
[2:52:04] and it's a very difficult situation this
[2:52:06] moment because
[2:52:07] even science realizes in a lot of ways
[2:52:09] they can artificially preserve
[2:52:11] existence
[2:52:13] and there are certain functions of the
[2:52:15] body that even even in this at this
[2:52:17] stage they can just kind of keep going
[2:52:21] but it's not apparent to them whether or
[2:52:24] not the baby can actually live
[2:52:26] because right we realize there's a
[2:52:27] difference between really living
[2:52:30] but in the scripture that loving
[2:52:31] kindness is better than life that means
[2:52:34] what is that because what could be
[2:52:35] better than life there's something
[2:52:36] greater than just the the functions of
[2:52:39] the body operating
[2:52:41] and so there's a decision that has to be
[2:52:42] made by medical professionals there's
[2:52:44] decisions that even parents have to make
[2:52:46] that's excruciating
[2:52:48] in this moment
[2:52:50] all the anticipation and expectation has
[2:52:52] led to this moment and now they're in
[2:52:54] this place where there's
[2:52:55] life-threatening complications or a very
[2:52:57] premature baby and it's in a life or
[2:52:59] death scenario
[2:53:01] that they're looking and they have to
[2:53:02] make a decision what should we do what
[2:53:04] should we do should we intervene should
[2:53:05] we try to sustain its life
[2:53:08] and in this moment
[2:53:11] everyone
[2:53:13] is trying to discern
[2:53:16] the baby's strength of will
[2:53:19] in other words at the very moment that
[2:53:21] there's a point at which the doctor's
[2:53:22] concern is the mother
[2:53:25] but as soon as the baby comes forth
[2:53:27] the doctor they'll now everyone's eye is
[2:53:29] turned to the the baby
[2:53:31] and they're looking at the baby and
[2:53:33] they're saying well
[2:53:34] can it live can it survive these the
[2:53:37] deformities can survive these
[2:53:38] complications and they're wanting to
[2:53:40] recognize where does the baby stand in
[2:53:42] all this
[2:53:44] i read of an example
[2:53:46] a baby was born at 23 weeks
[2:53:49] it was one pound four ounces i wanted to
[2:53:52] maybe find a doll to do it show you but
[2:53:54] it was the size of a barbie doll
[2:53:56] can you imagine that
[2:53:59] the size of a barbie doll its head was
[2:54:00] the size of a tennis ball
[2:54:03] its skin was nearly translucent
[2:54:06] they're looking at this baby that you
[2:54:08] could have just held
[2:54:10] in your hand like this and it was so
[2:54:12] small and so translucent you could
[2:54:14] actually see the heart flicker in its
[2:54:15] chest
[2:54:16] [Music]
[2:54:18] and the phrase they're born at the edge
[2:54:21] of viability
[2:54:23] and they look at this baby in that
[2:54:25] condition and they ask the question
[2:54:26] would it be better to save her life or
[2:54:28] let her die
[2:54:30] think about that
[2:54:32] and this moment they asked themselves
[2:54:35] should we let it die or should we try to
[2:54:37] save it
[2:54:39] title of an article i read and again
[2:54:41] this is something i read years ago god
[2:54:42] has never inspired it for me to preach
[2:54:44] but he he's brought it to you tonight
[2:54:46] i'm telling you this is years ago
[2:54:49] this has been i've been on my heart to
[2:54:51] share
[2:54:52] and the question was does anyone here
[2:54:53] think this baby can live
[2:54:55] [Music]
[2:54:57] does anyone here think these young
[2:54:58] people can live
[2:55:02] and in that moment the phrase that they
[2:55:04] use
[2:55:05] all eyes
[2:55:06] are now looked at looking at the baby
[2:55:08] they've done everything they can do
[2:55:10] the baby is delivered they've come to
[2:55:12] this point whereas there's a lot of
[2:55:13] things we can do to intervene there's a
[2:55:14] lot of things we could do to try to
[2:55:15] sustain this it's natural life and just
[2:55:17] keep it breathing maybe keep the heart
[2:55:18] beating and they look at and they step
[2:55:20] back and there comes a moment when this
[2:55:21] is the phrase they use they're looking
[2:55:22] for the baby to declare itself
[2:55:27] this doctor says i have to wait and let
[2:55:30] the baby declare itself
[2:55:32] and this heart of this doctor as he says
[2:55:34] this he says breathe
[2:55:36] cry
[2:55:37] show signs of life
[2:55:40] lord it comes to a point where now it's
[2:55:42] up to the baby
[2:55:44] one pound four ounces the size of a
[2:55:46] barbie doll a head the size of a tennis
[2:55:49] ball the flicker of the heart can be
[2:55:50] seen through translucent skin and
[2:55:52] they're looking at the baby and they
[2:55:53] know there's physiological things that
[2:55:55] are just that just babies do that bodies
[2:55:57] do there are certain things that are
[2:55:58] just going to be the reflexes of a
[2:56:00] muscle and so they're looking at trying
[2:56:02] to discern is there a desire
[2:56:05] is there a desire in this baby that
[2:56:08] wants to live
[2:56:10] and everyone's waiting with their breath
[2:56:12] anticipating for it to do what declare
[2:56:14] itself
[2:56:16] oh please in this moment this baby
[2:56:20] declare yourself do something and let us
[2:56:22] know you want to live do something to
[2:56:25] let us know that it's going to be worth
[2:56:27] every effort
[2:56:29] do something to declare that i want to
[2:56:31] live
[2:56:33] i want to live
[2:56:35] and i believe that we've arrived at a
[2:56:37] moment tonight we'll hear you sit in the
[2:56:41] darkest haze that there's ever been and
[2:56:43] i say will you declare yourself
[2:56:47] can you do it can you declare yourself
[2:56:53] declare your deliberate faith
[2:56:56] i've got that with a motive and
[2:56:58] objective behind it
[2:57:01] i say
[2:57:02] i thought about it it was just
[2:57:04] an image to me that was very hard to
[2:57:06] shake
[2:57:08] and if you want to live it says we're
[2:57:10] waiting for it to declare itself
[2:57:14] then you have to declare
[2:57:16] yourself who you really are
[2:57:19] you have to declare it's not
[2:57:20] and i heard it it's not the
[2:57:24] it's not what you want in your body
[2:57:26] it's not what you want in your spirit
[2:57:28] it's what you want your soul
[2:57:30] something beyond all that
[2:57:33] brother tim dodd ministered this at our
[2:57:35] home church in phoenix he said
[2:57:38] he was talking about hannah
[2:57:40] he said it's in a woman in her nature in
[2:57:42] her body her physical makeup to want a
[2:57:44] baby
[2:57:45] and so she can want one she could
[2:57:46] declare one
[2:57:47] he said and i'm using it maybe in my
[2:57:49] terminology they said even in their
[2:57:51] spirit it's the mother's nature you know
[2:57:52] what should her spirit she can want to
[2:57:54] have a baby it's a longing but hannah
[2:57:56] didn't cry from her body or her spirit
[2:57:59] she cried out from her soul and it was
[2:58:01] her sole purpose and when she cried out
[2:58:04] she said give me a son that i may give
[2:58:07] him back to you and god didn't just
[2:58:10] answer the natural desire he didn't
[2:58:11] answer a spiritual
[2:58:13] spirit desire he answered the soul
[2:58:15] purpose why it had declared itself in a
[2:58:18] painful desire
[2:58:20] and i want you to if you can imagine the
[2:58:22] icu and the needle natal unit how that
[2:58:24] all the doctors are standing back all
[2:58:26] the nurses are standing back the father
[2:58:28] and the mother all waiting what are we
[2:58:30] waiting for what are you waiting for
[2:58:32] we're waiting for this baby to say i
[2:58:35] want to live and all of heaven stands
[2:58:38] back all the angels stand back tonight
[2:58:41] and they're waiting for that moment that
[2:58:42] you'll take god in his word and step
[2:58:44] right into the furnace and declare your
[2:58:47] faith
[2:58:47] [Applause]
[2:58:51] to say i believe what god has revealed
[2:58:53] in this book
[2:58:55] i will obediently keep his commands
[2:58:58] i hope
[2:59:00] for what he's promised

[3:15:48] you know something he's not
[3:15:50] here tonight to

[3:16:02] he sees those dark places god sees
[3:16:06] you know that's that's the that's the
[3:16:08] literal definition of jehovah jireh god

[3:16:16] that's how he's a provider that means he
[3:16:18] can provide everything i need because
[3:16:20] there's nothing i need he's not aware of
[3:16:24] you know i was thinking tonight his
[3:16:25] brother aaron
[3:16:27] was ministering
[3:16:29] and you were hearing a trumpet of god
[3:16:32] that's what the gospel is do you know
[3:16:33] that you're hearing a trumpet of god and
[3:16:35] i thought about the days when
[3:16:38] the fire came down on the mountain and
[3:16:40] moses had everything prepared and all
[3:16:43] the people and
[3:16:44] they had they had sent out notices and
[3:16:46] everybody showed up to the meeting
[3:16:49] and everybody was ready and
[3:16:51] and pastor moses was ready and god was
[3:16:54] ready and the people were they thought
[3:16:55] they were ready
[3:16:56] and then god showed up
[3:16:58] and the mountain caught on fire and the
[3:17:00] ground shook and even moses said i'd
[3:17:03] begin to quake and tremble
[3:17:05] and the people all rolled back at the
[3:17:08] sound of the drum and said when it
[3:17:09] sounded loud and long
[3:17:12] and the people withdrew and moses turned
[3:17:15] to him and said no no
[3:17:17] no no don't don't go back
[3:17:20] he wants to talk to you
[3:17:22] come forward come forward don't don't
[3:17:26] don't run away from him run to him
[3:17:29] hallelujah
[3:17:30] you heard a trumpet tonight i want to
[3:17:32] tell you don't run from it run to it
[3:17:34] tonight
[3:17:36] it's a trumpet of liberty it's a trumpet
[3:17:38] where god can take direction in your
[3:17:40] life how many want that yes amen amen
[3:17:43] you know i thought to myself
[3:17:47] when does an idea
[3:17:50] you know we have
[3:17:51] many stories of great heroes
[3:17:54] and i just sit there pondering all the
[3:17:56] heroes you know and you history is
[3:17:58] replete with people who did valiant
[3:18:02] acts of in war and battle when the
[3:18:04] fighting was the fiercest and they
[3:18:06] charged into they ran toward the sound
[3:18:09] of explosions and toward the sound of
[3:18:11] screams and you know it takes a real
[3:18:13] hero you might be afraid but you go and
[3:18:15] do you do it anyway that's that's real
[3:18:17] courage
[3:18:19] and i just thought about that i thought
[3:18:21] what when does an idea
[3:18:24] when does a feeling something in your
[3:18:26] heart when does a reality young people
[3:18:29] become more important to you than your
[3:18:32] own life's blood
[3:18:35] that that a mere idea that comes into
[3:18:38] your heart can become so paramount to
[3:18:41] you that you will charge into a fierce
[3:18:44] battle at perhaps the cost of it
[3:18:47] amen the cost of your life the cost of
[3:18:50] your blood
[3:18:52] you heard a trumpet tonight friends
[3:18:55] i want to invite you tonight to say
[3:18:57] lord god tonight i heard your trumpet
[3:19:00] and i
[3:19:01] i i realize the world is thinking we're
[3:19:04] just going to go on and on and on and
[3:19:06] they're they're looking to the stars
[3:19:07] they're looking to mars and they're
[3:19:09] making all these plans but yet every
[3:19:11] metric i look at it in the world tells
[3:19:14] me it's not going to go on it's ending
[3:19:17] and i'm here to tell you i've been
[3:19:18] saying to my church a long time there's
[3:19:20] catastrophic judgments rushing to this
[3:19:23] earth and the only way out what is it
[3:19:25] friends up
[3:19:27] how many want to go up tonight
[3:19:29] say oh god i don't want to run i don't
[3:19:32] want to draw back from a trumpet sound
[3:19:34] i have i have adopted this word tonight
[3:19:38] and i've taken it into my heart and i'm
[3:19:40] inspirable by this word tonight
[3:19:43] and i want to run toward it
[3:19:45] i want to run toward it i want to step
[3:19:47] forward and say lord god i'll take the
[3:19:49] way
[3:19:50] with the despised brother branham
[3:19:53] comes to a pulpit in 1961 and preaches a
[3:19:56] beautiful message called a message of
[3:19:58] grace
[3:20:00] and in there he reminds us
[3:20:03] from god's message to zerubbabel
[3:20:06] during the days when the restoration was
[3:20:09] underway he said remember it's not by
[3:20:12] power it's not by might it's by my
[3:20:15] spirit
[3:20:16] brother branham says now i'm going to
[3:20:17] interpret that he says
[3:20:20] the headstone comes with shoutings of
[3:20:22] grace
[3:20:23] grace grace that's a trumpet friends how
[3:20:26] many want to run toward grace tonight
[3:20:29] are you willing to step forward and say
[3:20:30] i'll take the way with the lord's
[3:20:32] despised few this world holds nothing i
[3:20:35] realize tonight the pursuit of happiness
[3:20:38] is only in christ
[3:20:40] it's only in the word of god for this
[3:20:43] hour
[3:20:44] oh i want to ask brother matt to sing

[3:21:00] showing us
[3:21:01] that created
[3:21:02] on purpose
[3:21:04] he put you here on purpose
[3:21:07] everything that has happened in your
[3:21:09] life god has been in control of that to
[3:21:12] me that gives me a peace that passes
[3:21:15] understanding because

[3:21:19] i know i could never earn it on my own
[3:21:22] but i'm tell you something friends it's
[3:21:23] not by my might or by my own power by
[3:21:26] your power by your education by your
[3:21:28] strength by your influence by your
[3:21:29] social footprint by your by your wh
[3:21:32] where whatever station you are in life

[3:21:58] home i'm here you know when if it comes
[3:22:01] crying grace unto you then what is god

[3:22:05] reflection how many are willing to say
[3:22:07] i'll come crying christ i'll reflect
[3:22:09] that i'll be that that that element of
[3:22:13] grace that god can move on and have
[3:22:16] reason and purpose for his own self
[3:22:19] because i allowed him to have grace
[3:22:22] in my life
