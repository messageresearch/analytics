[26:02] brother amen matthew chapter four verse
[26:05] one
[26:08] then was jesus led up of the spirit into
[26:10] the wilderness to be tempted of the
[26:12] devil
[26:13] and when he had fasted 40 days and 40
[26:15] nights he was afterward and hungered
[26:18] and when the tempter came to him
[26:21] he said if thou be the son of god
[26:22] command that these stones be made bread
[26:25] but he answered and said it is written
[26:27] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[26:30] every word that proceedeth out of the
[26:32] mouth of god
[26:34] then the devil taketh him up into the
[26:36] holy city and setteth him on a pinnacle
[26:38] of the temple and saith unto him if thou
[26:41] be the son of god
[26:43] cast thyself down for it is written he
[26:46] shall give his angels charge concerning
[26:48] thee and in their hands they shall bear
[26:51] thee up lest at any time thou dash thy
[26:54] foot against a stone
[26:57] jesus said unto him it is written again
[26:59] thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god
[27:02] again the devil taketh him up into an
[27:05] exceeding high mountain
[27:07] and showeth him all the kingdoms of the
[27:09] world and the glory of them so he's
[27:12] looking prophetically into the future
[27:15] and and saith unto him
[27:18] all these things will i give thee
[27:20] if thou wilt fall down
[27:22] and worship me
[27:24] then saith jesus unto him get thee hints
[27:27] satan for it is written thou shalt
[27:30] worship the lord thy god and him only
[27:33] shalt thou serve
[27:35] then the devil leaveth him and behold
[27:39] angels came and ministered unto him
[27:42] amen let's go to first john chapter 2
[27:47] amen
[27:49] first john chapter 2
[27:55] and we will read verses 15 through
[28:01] 17.
[28:03] first john chapter 2 15-17
[28:08] love not the world
[28:11] neither the things that are in the world
[28:14] if any man love the world
[28:16] the love of the father is not in him
[28:19] for all that is in the world
[28:22] the lust of the flesh
[28:24] and the lust of the eyes and the pride
[28:27] of life
[28:28] is not of the father but is of the world
[28:32] and the world passeth away
[28:35] and the lust thereof
[28:38] but he that doeth the will of god
[28:40] abideth forever
[28:43] amen
[28:45] let's pray
[28:46] master we thank you for your
[28:49] word this evening and we come to this
[28:51] sacred time now lord for the delivery of
[28:54] the word to the people
[28:55] and i i know lord that i have the mind
[28:58] of christ for this evening and that has
[29:01] weighed heavily on me lord it just it
[29:03] just seems to have struck me so
[29:06] deeply today that i
[29:09] that myself just a mortal man
[29:12] with ups and downs and plenty of
[29:14] failures and weaknesses and yet
[29:16] your love and and your word is so
[29:20] sure
[29:21] that you would that that that today i
[29:24] have been in communion with the mind of
[29:27] god
[29:28] and i come tonight with the word of the
[29:31] lord to this people how great is your
[29:35] love lord for us we that just blows my
[29:38] mind lord i can hardly
[29:40] get my mind wrapped around it but yet i
[29:43] know i stand here tonight i stand here
[29:45] with that 100
[29:47] confidence lord i i'm unworthy of it
[29:50] we're all unworthy to hear anything from
[29:53] you of life but lord you loved us even
[29:56] while we were sinners so now that we're
[29:58] believers and we love you and we want to
[30:00] serve you surely lord god you will meet
[30:03] every need that we have in your word we
[30:06] commit ourselves into your hands in
[30:08] jesus name amen god bless your friends
[30:11] you can be seated
[30:25] it's interesting
[30:28] how that
[30:29] john sums up
[30:32] everything
[30:33] that's of the world
[30:34] in three categories
[30:36] the lust of the flesh the lust of the
[30:38] eyes and the pride of life
[30:41] and really
[30:42] no matter what you would face in this
[30:45] journey
[30:46] the devil is going to come after you
[30:48] in one or two or all three
[30:52] and you know
[30:54] he's making the point here
[30:56] that that that
[30:58] that we have a real devil
[31:01] and there are
[31:02] elements in this world
[31:04] that satan uses
[31:07] to draw you aside
[31:09] and to try to interrupt your journey to
[31:13] the promised land
[31:14] now
[31:15] you want to look at that 17th verse the
[31:18] world passeth away and the lust thereof
[31:22] so now you realize
[31:24] that everything and i i hope that you
[31:26] will
[31:27] catch this
[31:28] and really concentrate on this on just
[31:31] this one opening point
[31:33] that anything
[31:35] that you find yourself
[31:38] being drawn to
[31:39] that's outside of god's word and it
[31:42] happens to all of us
[31:44] more than three of you i know it happens
[31:46] to all of us
[31:47] the devil is constantly busy trying to
[31:50] draw us to the world away from the word
[31:54] he's not he's not hesitant to try that
[31:58] on you he tried it on the lord jesus
[32:01] he actually had such audacity
[32:04] that he he didn't just try to confound
[32:07] the written word he actually came to the
[32:10] highest form
[32:12] possible
[32:13] in the word
[32:15] flesh
[32:17] that's the highest form of the word of
[32:20] god
[32:21] is your flesh that's why it doesn't
[32:23] matter that's why satan doesn't care
[32:27] how right you are in your doctrine or
[32:29] how religious you are
[32:30] so
[32:31] he he it's not about he's not worried
[32:34] about how straight-laced your life can
[32:37] be
[32:38] what he is aware of is that if you miss
[32:41] the getting the new birth then you won't
[32:43] come up in the resurrection anyway
[32:46] see
[32:46] so when you realize then that god's
[32:50] ultimate goal
[32:51] is
[32:52] and has always been this is not new
[32:55] it is and it has always been to get his
[32:59] thoughts
[33:00] to a prophet and a prophet to put it on
[33:03] a scroll and a scroll to be read to the
[33:06] people and the people to have faith in
[33:08] the word and then the holy spirit would
[33:11] come and anoint that and live inside of
[33:14] his of his family so that now the
[33:17] thoughts of god that started the whole
[33:19] thing are living behind skin
[33:22] amen and this is why it matters how we
[33:26] live and and where we go and what we do
[33:29] that's why it is
[33:30] it is a um
[33:32] it is
[33:33] it is
[33:35] nonsensical and for a christian to
[33:38] that's why that's why jesus would say
[33:41] you know if you love the world or john
[33:44] would say concerning the teaching of
[33:46] christ if you love the world and the
[33:48] things of the world it's because the
[33:50] presence of god is not inside of you
[33:53] now you don't want to get trapped up in
[33:56] your fallen flesh because your fallen
[33:58] flesh loves the world
[34:01] and that's that's the greatest battle
[34:03] ever fault that's what you're here
[34:04] fighting that
[34:06] someday we'll have bodies that won't be
[34:09] subject to the lust of the flesh and the
[34:12] pride of life and the lust of the eye
[34:14] i'll be glad for that hour
[34:18] but right now we're proving that we're
[34:20] one in a million we're proving this last
[34:23] day bride by the way she lives not just
[34:26] the confession of her lips not just the
[34:28] convincing in her mind but her life is a
[34:31] living testimony
[34:33] of the word of god
[34:35] and in and in that testimony
[34:38] she proves that the word is true your
[34:41] life let me say it like this your life
[34:43] validates christ
[34:45] amen
[34:47] now i hope you take that
[34:49] and absorb the weight and the
[34:52] responsibility
[34:54] and
[34:55] let yourself feel the confidence and
[34:59] trust that god has in you by giving you
[35:04] the word of this hour and living inside
[35:06] you say i don't feel like much you're
[35:09] the apple of his eye oh i i don't see
[35:11] how i i'm no good i'm i'm nothing and
[35:14] you he sees no iniquity though israel
[35:17] had all kinds of iniquity jehovah said i
[35:20] don't see
[35:22] iniquity in jacob
[35:24] amen wasn't that it wasn't there but his
[35:27] grace
[35:29] we preach to you on the grace the
[35:31] encampment of the redeemed that that the
[35:34] the shout of the king was among them i'm
[35:36] here to tell you tonight the shout of
[35:37] the king is once again in the camp
[35:43] and so you just remember that
[35:46] all of the things
[35:47] especially teenagers remember that all
[35:50] of the things the devil tempts you with
[35:52] the lust of the flesh
[35:54] the lust of the eye the pride of life
[35:58] they
[35:58] are all passing away
[36:03] that's what we read
[36:05] and the world now what was the world the
[36:08] lust of the fleshless of the iron pride
[36:09] of life that was the world and the world
[36:12] passes the way
[36:14] and the lust thereof so i want to give
[36:17] you a good encouragement tonight hold on
[36:19] little brad it's not going to be much
[36:21] longer
[36:22] oh we're going to a land and we won't
[36:24] ever have to come back and fight this
[36:26] kind of a fight again
[36:28] hallelujah
[36:29] the devil will be put permanently in his
[36:31] place he deserves
[36:37] this is all as we've been studying
[36:40] the
[36:41] seven vials of revelation we found out
[36:44] that to me what is
[36:46] perhaps one of the grandest
[36:48] points of understanding
[36:50] is that all the all the mysteries of the
[36:53] book of revelation happen in a cluster
[36:57] and brother branham uses that word quite
[37:00] a you know quite a bit and and we find
[37:03] out that everything you read that's a
[37:04] mystery to the world and they you know
[37:07] they said to brother branham my
[37:09] john must have eaten a hot pepper that
[37:11] night before he went to bed and you know
[37:13] brother branham says aren't you ashamed
[37:15] you're supposed to be a minister of the
[37:16] gospel aren't you ashamed to say
[37:18] something like that
[37:19] and and how many preachers and with with
[37:24] with eight in 10 and 12 years of
[37:26] theology school with phds avoid that
[37:30] book that we study so freely and love
[37:34] hallelujah i i remember
[37:36] some time ago some years ago
[37:38] uh the the leading mega church pastor of
[37:42] our fair city got got asked the question
[37:45] oh you know what about the seven spirits
[37:48] of god
[37:49] you know what what about the seven
[37:50] spirits of god you know there's a
[37:52] discussion about the trinity and of
[37:54] course as far as he was concerned you're
[37:56] all going to hell and william branham's
[37:57] already in hell based on one thing one
[37:59] thing alone just one that he does not
[38:01] accept the trinity doctrine
[38:04] he said that on the radio i heard it
[38:06] myself
[38:08] and it doesn't matter
[38:09] all the millions that he led to christ
[38:11] it doesn't matter all the millions that
[38:13] were healed it doesn't matter all of the
[38:15] dust said the lord and all the miracles
[38:17] and everything that god did to validate
[38:18] it
[38:20] it all is for not because of that one
[38:23] thing and what he doesn't realize is is
[38:25] that he has fallen victim to us to three
[38:28] unclean spirits like frogs that came out
[38:31] of the beast oh my friends aren't you
[38:34] glad tonight that you have liberty you
[38:36] you see the word of god so clearly
[38:42] it's a ridiculous argument that they
[38:44] make i mean brother jason has so proven
[38:46] that here teaching on the godhead
[38:48] and and the trinity that they so-called
[38:51] it's my goodness it's a derived doctrine
[38:53] you know added to and crafted over
[38:55] hundreds of years it wasn't even an
[38:57] original teaching
[38:59] brother jason proved historically
[39:01] you know
[39:02] incontrovertibly that when they first
[39:04] began to even talk about it and put it
[39:06] on paper the holy ghost wasn't even
[39:09] included in it
[39:10] amen
[39:12] and now they want me and it wasn't
[39:14] taught by the early church but yet i'm
[39:16] supposed to believe that i'm going to go
[39:17] to hell because i don't believe a
[39:19] catholic version of babylonian
[39:22] polytheism
[39:24] oh blessed are your eyes for they see
[39:26] these things friends
[39:29] and it's all flowing in a cluster
[39:32] i think it's perhaps one of the grandest
[39:34] thing grandest of understandings
[39:37] from the book of revelation that has
[39:38] just been so eye-opening to us that it
[39:41] has all been
[39:43] perfectly synchronized that's
[39:45] what a feat
[39:47] what an accomplishment
[39:48] for the holy spirit that that that at
[39:51] all of these events happening in a
[39:53] cluster
[39:54] down through centuries and yet it's it's
[39:57] all been perfectly and harmoniously
[40:02] and flawlessly synchronized by the holy
[40:05] ghost throughout all of history
[40:08] amen
[40:09] like uh as brother branham referred to
[40:11] it like a great work of of music
[40:15] from a master composer and how that god
[40:18] sent a
[40:19] a human messenger into the earth as a
[40:21] conductor uh a conductor of an elected
[40:24] orchestra
[40:25] oh my
[40:27] a people whose very names are recorded
[40:30] in the book of life in the section of
[40:32] the lamb before the foundation of the
[40:34] world
[40:36] how that seven ages
[40:38] uncovered and as seven ages were
[40:40] uncovered we found out that it's been
[40:43] the history
[40:44] of the seven spirits of god living
[40:46] wasn't that we had seven gods any more
[40:48] than we got three
[40:50] there's one see but it's the seven
[40:53] spirits of god living
[40:55] and working through the true church
[40:57] that's what the ages were about the
[41:00] christ living and working through his
[41:02] true church battling the false church in
[41:04] every age and she's still battling it
[41:07] i say fight on
[41:09] i say i will fight to my last dying
[41:11] breath i want my last dying breath to be
[41:14] satan is a liar and god's word is true
[41:20] we find that it was uh it's been a
[41:21] battle of the true church versus the
[41:23] false church and how that according to
[41:25] luke 17 and i'm just covering these
[41:28] rudimentary things that because we're we
[41:30] we skipped a sermon on our series god
[41:33] pulled me off of it i'm trying to get
[41:34] back in track
[41:35] you know we found that according to luke
[41:37] 17 24
[41:39] how that it all happens and all
[41:42] everything coming down in all of this
[41:44] cluster
[41:45] how that we found out that it was it was
[41:47] referred to as lightning that traveled
[41:50] through the earth from east to west over
[41:53] 2 000 years of church history
[41:57] interestingly enough
[41:59] when you read luke 17 24 let me have
[42:01] that g man luke 17 24
[42:04] uh sorry to jump you again i didn't i
[42:06] should have sent that to you already
[42:08] luke 17 24 for as the lightning
[42:11] that lightneth out of the one part under
[42:14] heaven
[42:15] shineth unto the other part unto heaven
[42:19] so shall also
[42:21] the son of man be
[42:23] in his day
[42:25] now it's interesting this term go back
[42:27] please it's interesting this term
[42:30] under heaven
[42:32] all right so we see that that that the
[42:34] lightning that the all of this cluster
[42:36] of events that's happening in the ages
[42:39] and happening in the seals and happening
[42:41] under the trumpets and happening under
[42:43] the vials and it's all been synchronous
[42:46] and harmonized by the holy spirit and
[42:48] it's it was it was shown to be traveling
[42:50] through the earth like lightning from
[42:52] east to west and this whole term under
[42:55] heaven now this term under
[42:58] is an interesting greek word that has uh
[43:01] a compound meaning firstly
[43:03] it speaks of a
[43:05] particularly
[43:06] of a place
[43:08] meaning
[43:09] uh meaning a place uh wince you know a
[43:13] place from whence it came from under
[43:15] from which something comes forth and the
[43:19] next thing is that it is a losing here's
[43:23] its effect it's a losing or freeing from
[43:26] under something you're and so so when
[43:29] you when you look in other scriptures
[43:32] and you cross the reference that word
[43:34] you find a host of places two of my
[43:36] favorites that i'll touch on tonight is
[43:39] acts 2 24
[43:40] whom god has speaking of christ peter
[43:43] says whom god hath raised up
[43:46] having loosed the pains
[43:49] uh uh let me get a lot of place having
[43:51] loosed the pains of death because it was
[43:54] not possible that he should beholden of
[43:56] it so now we realize that here's the
[44:00] losing part of that greek word that word
[44:03] that meant under heaven as the lightning
[44:05] travels from the east to the west under
[44:08] heaven so shall the coming of the son of
[44:10] man be so what is it done the word came
[44:13] to loose god's people it came to set
[44:15] them free from the bondage of sin it
[44:18] came to set you free and set you at
[44:20] liberty from the tyranny of the of the
[44:22] evil one
[44:24] i'm glad that that lightning in every
[44:26] age has liberated god's people
[44:30] and then you find this voice speaking
[44:32] it's the exact same voice in ii peter
[44:36] chapter 1 verse 17 where peter speaking
[44:39] of it here in his testifying second
[44:42] peter 1 17 for he receiveth from god the
[44:46] father
[44:47] honor and glory
[44:49] when there came such a voice to him from
[44:53] the excellent glory and here's what it
[44:55] said this is my beloved son in whom i am
[44:58] well pleased i'm here to tell you
[45:00] something friends that that same voice
[45:03] that has spoke again in our day and it
[45:07] came from the same place because it's
[45:09] the same lightning from the east to the
[45:11] west and as it spoke of jesus it speaks
[45:14] of you and it's the same voice when the
[45:17] mighty angel descended what was it it
[45:20] was the voice of the archangel
[45:23] and what does it do it's setting you
[45:24] free it's giving you liberty it's giving
[45:27] you overcoming power
[45:31] that's what the lightning under heaven
[45:33] does
[45:36] see
[45:39] i'll tell you something friends
[45:41] i've been loose from the pains of death
[45:44] just like jesus was because you know why
[45:47] it wasn't possible that death could hold
[45:49] him oh the same voice that loosed him
[45:51] has loosed you you've been loosed from
[45:54] the pains of death he has loosed her and
[45:56] i want you to know something this world
[45:58] can't hold you
[46:00] the same way it couldn't hold him the
[46:02] grave couldn't hold him it can't hold
[46:04] you one of these days gravity is going
[46:07] to lose its power over me
[46:10] hallelujah
[46:12] we've got a day coming on to god friends
[46:16] and gravity will lose its hold
[46:19] every promise that we've waited for all
[46:21] these years will become material
[46:23] and he who you've looked for will
[46:25] suddenly come to his temple
[46:29] so we found that him working through the
[46:31] ages in a cluster we found
[46:34] the understanding of the seven seals and
[46:39] how it unfolded to us and when it did
[46:42] we discovered the power of god
[46:44] was portrayed as living creatures
[46:48] and you know you you go in the book of
[46:49] revelation and you read about the lion
[46:52] and the
[46:52] ox and the man and the flying eagle
[46:55] because it's got a these these living
[46:58] creatures represent a power a beast in
[47:00] the bible represents power
[47:02] and then you find that the antichrist
[47:04] also had
[47:05] riding beast he's riding a white horse
[47:08] and he's riding a red horse then he's
[47:09] riding a black horse and then we come to
[47:11] the last day and he's trying to ride a
[47:13] pale horse and he could ride he could
[47:16] actually win if it wasn't for always
[47:17] losing he could actually ride if it
[47:20] wasn't for the presence of the bride of
[47:22] christ saying not so fast oh boy oh look
[47:25] we're still here and the grace is still
[47:28] here and you're not going to get on that
[47:30] pony just yet hallelujah friends do you
[47:33] understand the authority that's in your
[47:35] life today
[47:36] as a believer
[47:39] so when he comes into your home with
[47:40] sickness know this he has no authority
[47:44] you have it all
[47:46] amen
[47:48] amen when he strikes your finances when
[47:50] he strikes your marriage when he strikes
[47:52] your children just to understand this he
[47:54] has no authority because you have it all
[47:58] hallelujah he doesn't have the power of
[48:00] the spoken word because you've got the
[48:01] power of the spoken word
[48:04] he has no power of creation because why
[48:07] that voice is in the bride of christ
[48:14] so we discovered the power of god as
[48:16] living creatures
[48:19] christ living through his bride this all
[48:21] in a cluster
[48:22] all happening synchronously
[48:26] down through history
[48:28] christ living through his bride battling
[48:30] the beast powers
[48:32] of the antichrist
[48:35] a war
[48:37] that began in in heaven brother branham
[48:40] said
[48:41] and spilled over into the earth and from
[48:43] genesis
[48:44] to revelation and now we've had 2 000
[48:47] years
[48:49] of intense warfare
[48:51] amen
[48:54] they've had terrible natural wars
[48:56] they don't compare
[48:58] because you say but millions have died
[49:00] in these wars but jesus said don't fear
[49:03] him who can destroy body
[49:05] fear him who can destroy soul in hell
[49:08] so the spiritual wars have been far more
[49:11] devastating to humanity than the natural
[49:14] wars
[49:15] you know natural you you die but if you
[49:18] die in christ you really can't die
[49:21] you don't die you can't die it's
[49:22] impossible for you to die see
[49:25] and so so we realized that this terrible
[49:28] spiritual warfare has been going on this
[49:31] intense warfare
[49:33] during the
[49:34] the redemption time of the gentile
[49:36] church the seven trumpets we've been
[49:38] studying the seven trumpets how they
[49:40] chronicle the restoration and
[49:42] the regathering of israel to the feast
[49:44] of atonement we found out that there
[49:47] that that you know in every all down
[49:49] through the ages they were unfolding to
[49:51] the jews so that when moses and elijah
[49:54] get to them with this very message and
[49:56] this very holy ghost that you so love
[49:58] and enjoy
[50:00] that's going to be part of their message
[50:01] because they think they've been
[50:02] abandoned and it's going to take moses
[50:05] and elijah to say no no no let's go back
[50:07] to the trumpets i'm going to show you
[50:09] you never were abandoned
[50:12] he was always working even when it
[50:15] looked horrible even when it looked the
[50:16] worst ever it was the tender hand of
[50:18] jehovah
[50:21] see
[50:23] so it chronicles the restoration the
[50:25] seven vials that we've been speaking of
[50:27] particularly striking
[50:29] partially in every age we found that and
[50:31] proved it by the bible
[50:33] and of course in every age as they
[50:35] partially are unfolded they provide
[50:37] an opportunity each time for the beast
[50:40] system
[50:41] to take its next step forward into you
[50:44] know what i would call the political
[50:46] slash
[50:47] uh
[50:48] natural realms of mankind we see them
[50:51] unfolding as temporary judgments and and
[50:55] and each time
[50:57] each time that they as those vials
[51:01] began to unfold
[51:02] temporarily in each age poured out
[51:05] partially remember remember we've taught
[51:07] on it then we find that each time say
[51:10] brother jason what does it mean can you
[51:12] give me one example i'll give you the
[51:13] best one how that's how that the vials
[51:16] allowed satan to to progress
[51:19] each time to progress because the most
[51:21] devastating impact of the viles is that
[51:24] every time
[51:26] a temporary judgment is coming you find
[51:28] satan capturing each time and with each
[51:32] age a little more of the minds of man of
[51:35] the whole entire human race so that at
[51:38] the end time by the time you reach the
[51:40] seventh one and it's poured out in the
[51:42] tribulation period in its fullness you
[51:44] find man's mind totally gone
[51:48] he has slowly encroached upon the sanity
[51:51] of man so that the bible says in the end
[51:54] time he'll even lose the ability to
[51:57] discern between right and wrong and the
[51:59] only salvation is the mind of christ the
[52:02] only way you stay sane the only way you
[52:04] know what to do the only thing only way
[52:07] you know how to act and react is by the
[52:09] mind of christ and so paul says let this
[52:12] mind
[52:14] which was in christ being you
[52:18] assemble yourselves more as you see that
[52:20] evil day approaching because the time
[52:22] will come when man won't endure sound
[52:24] doctrine
[52:25] he'll heap to themselves teachers having
[52:28] itching ears people will get preachers
[52:30] who'll tell them what they want the
[52:31] gospel to be remember i said to you
[52:33] whatever if you're if you're not born
[52:35] again
[52:37] you're now under the insane notion that
[52:40] it comes now it's always been through
[52:41] seven ages but now it's coming to its
[52:43] perfect
[52:44] perfect climax it's reaching its zenith
[52:46] it's now satan's eden
[52:49] it's now the he's now the god of the
[52:50] civil lights brother the breton goes
[52:51] back to galatians back to the book of
[52:53] corinthians and he proves that that day
[52:56] was this day and in no other day could
[52:58] he be caught or would he be called the
[53:00] god of this evil age
[53:04] as god taken six thousand years to build
[53:06] his eden now satan has had six thousand
[53:08] years to build his
[53:11] and the only safety is the mind of
[53:13] christ
[53:15] that mankind would go completely insane
[53:18] and be unable to discern between right
[53:21] and wrong
[53:22] and i said to you how that
[53:24] that this is the we're now at the age
[53:27] say how in the world did we get to when
[53:31] brother branham was alive there was only
[53:33] 900 and some odd different denominations
[53:35] how did we go in a half century what
[53:38] took 2 000 years to get to and in and in
[53:41] and in the last 50 plus years we went
[53:43] from 900 and some to north of 33 000.
[53:48] amen
[53:50] minds of man
[53:53] going going crazy unable to discern
[53:55] between right and wrong and i said if if
[53:58] you're in this day listen friends you
[53:59] listen well if you're trying to get by
[54:02] and you have not allowed the mind of
[54:04] christ if you have not allowed the holy
[54:06] spirit to bring a gene to life in you if
[54:08] you have not surrendered your heart and
[54:10] let christ come in and be the all and
[54:12] all and be first and be the center
[54:15] then you know what you'll do you know
[54:16] what your mind will convince you to do
[54:19] you'll go around hunting the version of
[54:21] the gospel that you want to be true
[54:25] and there's plenty of preachers out
[54:27] there in this end time with itching ears
[54:29] many false prophets the bible doesn't
[54:30] say it doesn't you say people say oh the
[54:33] bible says there's a false prophet the
[54:34] bible says there will be many false
[54:37] prophets and they will deceive many
[54:41] and i'm here to tell you there's only
[54:42] one security and that's the word of god
[54:45] and that's the mind of christ and that's
[54:46] the new birth and that's the holy ghost
[54:48] and that's this message that god has
[54:50] given us in this hour
[54:53] it's the only place of safety and the
[54:55] only place of sanity
[54:58] amen
[54:59] you better have it first and foremost in
[55:01] your homes
[55:03] if you want your children to have even a
[55:05] fighting chance
[55:06] you better have the word of god first
[55:08] and foremost it ought to be the main
[55:10] theme in the center of our homes the
[55:12] center of our of our of our education in
[55:15] the center of our learning in the center
[55:17] of our family affairs in the center of
[55:19] our vacations
[55:20] this is not an hour that you cannot have
[55:23] that you must have the mind of christ on
[55:25] display
[55:27] this is the token time
[55:29] the death angel is in the camp and the
[55:32] death angel is coming to eat everything
[55:34] that's not under the blood
[55:37] oh my
[55:40] so we see them unfolding
[55:44] and satan capturing
[55:48] the minds of men more and more
[55:53] amen
[55:57] and it
[55:58] i heard brother jack this morning on our
[56:00] call in bible study but the jack made it
[56:02] a a point that is so simple but it blew
[56:06] my mind and brother jack just says
[56:09] think of this
[56:10] all of this revelation prophecy
[56:13] everything that we read about all of
[56:15] this stuff happening in a cluster
[56:17] say oh my goodness it's just going to go
[56:20] on and on and on and on no it's not no
[56:23] it can't
[56:24] because it's because everything that we
[56:28] find
[56:29] ends up under the seventh seal and winds
[56:31] itself out
[56:33] and even time itself finally comes to an
[56:35] end after the millennium but we find
[56:38] that everything in those prophet
[56:40] prophetical uh things that we study
[56:43] all have to be finished by the last half
[56:46] of one week
[56:48] of israel's time clock
[56:50] everything has to happen in the last
[56:53] half of daniel's 70th week
[56:55] and so we find that that christ comes
[56:59] and lives out the first half of that
[57:02] first of that 70th week and there's only
[57:05] a half a week left to redeem israel i'm
[57:08] here to tell you something friends god
[57:10] is not just going to keep waiting
[57:11] forever and ever his his desires his
[57:14] bowels are yearning for benjamin
[57:17] oh hallelujah and he cannot have
[57:19] benjamin until you are tucked away in
[57:21] the palace
[57:23] when i see what's happening in israel
[57:25] and i see what's happening in russia i
[57:26] see what's happening in china i'm here
[57:28] to tell you something friends we are on
[57:30] our way to the palace
[57:32] you can just believe it tonight we're on
[57:34] our way to the palace
[57:37] oh my
[57:40] so when he says now
[57:44] in first john 2 back where we took our
[57:46] part of our text 16 and 17
[57:49] for all that is in the world the lust of
[57:52] the flesh and the lust of the eyes and
[57:54] the pride of life first john 2 16 for
[57:57] all that is in the world the lust of the
[57:58] flesh the lust of the eyes the pride of
[57:59] life is not of the father
[58:04] i could just
[58:05] stop
[58:06] right there and just look you all in the
[58:09] eye and spend the rest of the service
[58:11] mute
[58:13] and just give you that
[58:15] the lust of the flesh
[58:16] the lust of the eye
[58:18] the pride of life
[58:20] look at me it's not of the father
[58:24] it's not
[58:25] it didn't come from him
[58:27] it can't survive
[58:29] stop chasing it because it's going down
[58:31] it's going down in flames
[58:33] see
[58:34] it's not of see
[58:36] it's not of the father
[58:38] do you believe john
[58:41] it's not of the father
[58:43] but is of the world
[58:45] and the world passeth away in the lust
[58:48] thereof but he that doeth the will of
[58:51] god i love that
[58:53] but he that doeth the will of god
[58:55] abideth forever
[59:00] it's observed that
[59:03] satan
[59:04] is seen here in the wilderness
[59:06] temptation of jesus
[59:09] following the exact same strategy that
[59:11] he did in genesis 3. this that shouldn't
[59:13] surprise you
[59:14] because you know we we see that
[59:16] babylonian system you see it that
[59:18] babylonian system in the beginning of
[59:20] the bible in the middle of the bible and
[59:22] at the end of the bible you see it under
[59:24] nimrod in ancient babylon you see it
[59:27] under nebuchadnezzar in the middle of
[59:29] the bible and then you see it at the end
[59:31] of the book of revelation only now it's
[59:33] called mystery babylon
[59:35] and it's unknown to the world that it's
[59:37] the same babylon see
[59:40] and people are falling for it
[59:43] and so we find that satan is now coming
[59:45] to christ in the wilderness
[59:48] and he's using the exact same pattern
[59:50] this is an important point that you you
[59:53] should really pay attention to because
[59:55] when you watch an enemy if you can watch
[59:57] you you were supposed to know our enemy
[59:59] and learn his patterns see brother
[1:00:00] branham taught us that
[1:00:02] and so when you see the pattern that he
[1:00:04] uses
[1:00:05] it's the exact same pattern that he went
[1:00:08] after even in genesis 3.
[1:00:11] amen so you just remember brother jason
[1:00:14] uh took you into the scripture and
[1:00:16] showed you that that that what john that
[1:00:18] that what matthew is talking about in
[1:00:20] the fourth chapter of matthew is the
[1:00:22] same pattern repeated in genesis 3.
[1:00:26] see
[1:00:27] because we find that first what does he
[1:00:29] do
[1:00:31] first he appealed
[1:00:32] to the lust of the flesh
[1:00:38] the desire to
[1:00:40] do
[1:00:40] something apart from god's will
[1:00:46] the lust of the eyes
[1:00:48] the desire to have something
[1:00:51] apart from god's will amen
[1:00:55] third he appealed to the pride of life
[1:00:59] the desire to be something
[1:01:02] apart from
[1:01:03] god's will
[1:01:05] now that's exactly what he did satan
[1:01:07] tried in the eternities
[1:01:09] that was his eye disease
[1:01:11] i will ascend i will be like the most
[1:01:13] high he didn't want to obey
[1:01:16] god's word is it any wonder
[1:01:20] is it does it surprise you
[1:01:22] that when he comes to anoint you he
[1:01:25] tries to talk you into doing things
[1:01:27] contrary to god's will
[1:01:30] he tries to get you to do things that
[1:01:33] are out of the will of god the lust of
[1:01:36] the flesh he tries to get you to have
[1:01:38] things
[1:01:39] you know go after the world here satan
[1:01:42] offered eve something and he's offering
[1:01:44] jesus something and
[1:01:46] it's now lust of the eyes and oh he's a
[1:01:48] master at it he's a master at it friends
[1:01:50] your only hope is the holy ghost
[1:01:54] and even then it's still the greatest
[1:01:55] battle ever fought
[1:01:57] but you can win it you can win it there
[1:02:00] is overcoming power in the blood of the
[1:02:02] lamb
[1:02:03] hallelujah
[1:02:05] oh my
[1:02:06] the lust of the flesh the desire to do
[1:02:08] something apart from god's will the lust
[1:02:10] of the eyes the desire to have something
[1:02:13] apart from god's will the pride of life
[1:02:15] the desire to be something apart from
[1:02:18] god's will how many young men and young
[1:02:21] women have wanted to be something they
[1:02:23] saw they wanted to be somebody they saw
[1:02:25] on youtube they wanted to be somebody
[1:02:27] they saw on a gridiron they wanted to be
[1:02:29] somebody they saw on a basketball court
[1:02:31] i want to be somebody that hung on a
[1:02:33] tree
[1:02:35] i want to be somebody that walked
[1:02:36] calvary's road that's who i want to be i
[1:02:39] want to be like the one who ascended on
[1:02:41] high
[1:02:43] and death couldn't hold him that's who i
[1:02:45] want to be like
[1:02:48] all three
[1:02:50] of the tests are simply variations
[1:02:54] of the one great temptation satan is
[1:02:56] bringing because his goal you have to
[1:02:57] look at his goal
[1:02:59] brother barry talked about this at the
[1:03:01] men's breakfast
[1:03:03] we had such a wonderful time
[1:03:06] how that satan you know here he
[1:03:08] what is he trying to do he's trying to
[1:03:11] he he's trying to destroy the commission
[1:03:14] of christ
[1:03:15] because here jesus comes he's the savior
[1:03:17] of the world if satan can derail him and
[1:03:21] knock him off of god's plan then the
[1:03:23] world don't get saved
[1:03:27] because he's the savior
[1:03:28] he's a redeemer
[1:03:30] and if satan can knock him off of god's
[1:03:32] will if satan can offer him something
[1:03:35] that's a lust of his eye if satan can
[1:03:38] offer him a lust of his flesh if satan
[1:03:40] can offer him a pride of life and knock
[1:03:43] him off path
[1:03:46] then he can derail the commission
[1:03:48] the world don't get saved the world
[1:03:50] don't get redeemed there is no healing
[1:03:53] there is no new birth there is no holy
[1:03:55] ghost we're all going to perish anyway
[1:03:58] if the holy ghost if paul said if the
[1:03:59] resurrection is false and if it's fake
[1:04:01] and there's no resurrection then our
[1:04:03] preaching is vain your worship is vain
[1:04:05] your faith is in vain we might as well
[1:04:07] all go eat drink and be merry
[1:04:10] i'm so glad it's real
[1:04:12] i'm so glad it's true i'm so glad i've
[1:04:15] proven it and we got people in this
[1:04:17] audience tonight who can say i have
[1:04:19] proven it i have proven that it's real i
[1:04:22] have proven that it's accessible
[1:04:25] hallelujah
[1:04:28] brother branham says in the god of this
[1:04:29] evil age
[1:04:32] he says strange now now remember i've
[1:04:34] already told you
[1:04:36] this is in brother branham's series on
[1:04:38] where his burden is on the vials i've
[1:04:40] proven it to you we're not recapping all
[1:04:42] of that
[1:04:44] so and and what i've showed you is that
[1:04:47] that the vial is pouring out partially
[1:04:49] and every agent poured out partially and
[1:04:51] it was released into the air so it's all
[1:04:53] of the madness of man's mind
[1:04:55] see
[1:04:56] and part of that madness is to get you
[1:04:58] to disregard everything i'm saying to
[1:05:00] you tonight
[1:05:01] don't let that happen
[1:05:05] don't be
[1:05:06] satan's victim
[1:05:10] amen
[1:05:12] the holy spirit
[1:05:13] compels me
[1:05:14] to walk among you
[1:05:16] look you in the eye and say don't
[1:05:19] be
[1:05:20] satan's victim
[1:05:23] don't
[1:05:24] be
[1:05:26] satan's
[1:05:27] victim
[1:05:28] don't be
[1:05:29] satan's victim
[1:05:31] he has only one goal and that is to
[1:05:34] steal and to kill and to destroy he's
[1:05:38] not your friend he's he doesn't love you
[1:05:41] he doesn't even like you
[1:05:42] he hates your family he hates the
[1:05:45] prophet he hates the word he hated jesus
[1:05:48] hallelujah it's why cain killed abel
[1:05:51] because he hated that
[1:05:53] don't be satan's victim friends
[1:05:56] you have a choice tonight to not be
[1:06:02] how many want to take the choice to not
[1:06:04] be
[1:06:05] say i'm not going to be a victim
[1:06:07] i'm not going down with him i'm i
[1:06:10] realize the world is passing away in all
[1:06:11] the lust and so i'm going to get rid of
[1:06:13] it now
[1:06:14] i'm not chasing those kinds of things
[1:06:16] anymore that cluster has already reached
[1:06:19] its climax
[1:06:21] satan has already reached his zenith
[1:06:23] it's already too late for the world
[1:06:25] [Music]
[1:06:26] amen
[1:06:29] the church has already
[1:06:31] kicked christ out
[1:06:33] they've already become their own voice
[1:06:40] so brother branham says here in this
[1:06:42] vials series
[1:06:46] 1965 august 1
[1:06:48] paragraph 40. strange now
[1:06:51] strange now
[1:06:53] and i should just get your attention a
[1:06:54] prophet like wow
[1:06:56] this is a this is a dispensational angel
[1:06:59] this is the guy who spends half of his
[1:07:01] time in another realm
[1:07:03] this is a guy who's stood and talked
[1:07:05] face to face many times
[1:07:08] with the lord jesus the angel of the
[1:07:10] lord's presence amen
[1:07:13] he starts this paragraph
[1:07:15] with a word two words strange now
[1:07:18] after some 1900 years of gospel
[1:07:21] preaching
[1:07:23] now
[1:07:25] she
[1:07:26] that is the world system
[1:07:29] is more evil
[1:07:31] than in the days when he was here
[1:07:37] the world system is more evil
[1:07:40] the world is heading to a great climax
[1:07:45] you know that
[1:07:47] the lord
[1:07:48] is fulfilling his word
[1:07:51] on every hand
[1:07:54] that tells me two things
[1:07:56] he's in control of that antichrist
[1:07:58] spirit
[1:07:59] and he's in control of me
[1:08:02] he's fulfilling his word
[1:08:04] he's got a word for the unbelievers he's
[1:08:06] got a word for the make believers and
[1:08:08] he's got a word for the believers
[1:08:10] and he is fulfilling it as we speak
[1:08:14] you're sitting in this service tonight
[1:08:16] and you're and god is
[1:08:19] trying to fulfill the promise of his
[1:08:21] word in your life and in your heart and
[1:08:24] the only power on earth that can stop
[1:08:26] him is you
[1:08:30] you must let this mind which was in
[1:08:32] christ be in you
[1:08:34] this is an age
[1:08:37] i'm going to close
[1:08:39] but hear me out to the end will you
[1:08:42] this is an age of maximum temptation
[1:08:47] don't be naive
[1:08:50] there's there's a reason
[1:08:52] that we organize our lives to avoid
[1:08:55] these things of the world
[1:08:57] there's a reason men turn their head
[1:08:59] quickly there's a reason that you
[1:09:01] shouldn't watch certain things
[1:09:03] on your phone or your laptop or your
[1:09:05] computer there's a reason you shouldn't
[1:09:07] go certain places
[1:09:09] there's a reason you should come to
[1:09:10] church there's a reason you should read
[1:09:12] your bible there's a reason you should
[1:09:14] have an active prayer life
[1:09:16] there's a reason that you don't hang
[1:09:18] around with the wrong friends
[1:09:21] there's reasons
[1:09:23] see
[1:09:24] this is an age of maximum temptation
[1:09:28] on the lust of the flesh
[1:09:31] maximum
[1:09:32] temptation on the lust of the eyes
[1:09:36] maximum temptation
[1:09:38] for the pride of life
[1:09:42] so when jesus said in matthew 4
[1:09:44] 10 and 11 then said jesus unto him get
[1:09:48] thee hint satan
[1:09:50] for it is written
[1:09:52] thou shalt worship the lord thy god
[1:09:55] and him only
[1:09:58] shalt thou serve
[1:10:00] now verse 11 is profound
[1:10:04] then the devil leaveth him
[1:10:08] that's the first half of the verse the
[1:10:10] second half
[1:10:11] and angels came and ministered unto him
[1:10:17] so now three things happened in rapid
[1:10:19] succession
[1:10:21] jesus
[1:10:22] gave the command of the word to lucifer
[1:10:27] amen
[1:10:28] and immediately lucifer left
[1:10:33] people have done that
[1:10:35] people who follow satan satan left him
[1:10:38] when jesus gave the devil
[1:10:41] the command of the word
[1:10:43] satan
[1:10:44] refused to do it you know what the
[1:10:47] command was worship the lord thy god
[1:10:51] he gives him the command of the word and
[1:10:54] as soon as he gives him the command of
[1:10:56] the word to worship god satan refused to
[1:10:59] do it and satan left him and so do those
[1:11:04] who he has control of they refuse to
[1:11:08] obey the command oh you might come to a
[1:11:11] church building i get that you might you
[1:11:14] might come into this building you might
[1:11:16] sing louder than anybody else in the
[1:11:20] building oh but i'm here to tell you
[1:11:22] there's a people who come into churches
[1:11:24] and sing louder than anybody else but
[1:11:26] they refuse to let their lives become a
[1:11:31] living worship
[1:11:33] [Applause]
[1:11:34] they don't mind gathering at a building
[1:11:36] they don't mind lifting their voice and
[1:11:39] singing to the top of their lungs they
[1:11:41] don't mind being in a choir they don't
[1:11:43] mind memorizing scripture verse but they
[1:11:45] won't ever allow their life to be a
[1:11:48] worship that your whole life is a living
[1:11:50] worship of the almighty god
[1:11:54] satan won't do it those who he has
[1:11:56] control of won't do it they will not
[1:11:58] allow their lives they they will not
[1:12:01] submit themselves
[1:12:05] amen they'll sing they'll come in a
[1:12:08] building
[1:12:10] but they won't submit themselves to the
[1:12:13] word of god
[1:12:15] for their life
[1:12:17] amen
[1:12:19] they will not allow their life to become
[1:12:24] a living
[1:12:25] worship
[1:12:26] of god
[1:12:28] satan did this same thing friends
[1:12:31] you understand
[1:12:32] he did this same thing back in eternity
[1:12:36] he he was acting the same way back then
[1:12:38] when morning stars sang together
[1:12:41] he wasn't included in there he wouldn't
[1:12:43] come in worship when morning stars and
[1:12:46] sons of god shouted for joy i want to
[1:12:48] tell you something he wouldn't be a part
[1:12:49] of that camp and oh praise the name of
[1:12:52] god he's not a part of this camp
[1:12:54] he's not a part of this church don't let
[1:12:56] him be a part of this church don't let
[1:12:57] him be a part of your family don't let
[1:12:59] him be a part on your job or on your in
[1:13:01] your schools or in the hallways don't
[1:13:03] let him be apart don't let him be in
[1:13:05] your camp
[1:13:07] this is the camp of the king this is the
[1:13:09] camp of the presence of almighty god
[1:13:12] oh there should be no place for him in
[1:13:15] our homes
[1:13:16] no place for him and on jobs no place
[1:13:19] for him in our classrooms there should
[1:13:21] be no place for him in our lives
[1:13:24] i love the second part of that 11th
[1:13:26] verse angels came from heaven and
[1:13:27] fulfilled it
