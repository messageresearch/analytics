[17:08] let's get brother travis knows the hand
[17:10] again
[17:10] [Music]
[17:12] [Applause]
[17:15] i'd like to give a quick testimony about
[17:17] these special
[17:19] when i was on a job i had a little
[17:23] little boy's name came up named cody and
[17:25] it was this
[17:26] little boy's grandson who was i was
[17:29] working with him doing ac work and
[17:31] the little boy had brain cancer and they
[17:34] had to go in and take out a big mass in
[17:36] his brain and his
[17:37] he didn't respond to it very well and so
[17:40] i began to put in prayer requests
[17:42] for this little boy and so brad yance
[17:45] from up in tennessee heard about it
[17:47] and next time he came down he actually
[17:49] brought me what a brother brand's prayer
[17:51] cloth
[17:52] so um next chance i got i went over
[17:54] there and uh
[17:56] i was able to sit with him so his mother
[18:00] the back story is his mother abandoned
[18:02] him before
[18:03] he had this brain cancer his mother
[18:06] abandoned him his grandparents were
[18:09] just the not the best people they were
[18:11] they smoked in the house i mean here's
[18:13] this boy with cancer and they're just
[18:15] it's a pretty awful situation the boys
[18:17] probably never heard about the lord
[18:19] never went to church never probably
[18:20] heard gospel songs so
[18:22] i began to i went over there to pray for
[18:26] him
[18:26] and uh and so i had these this songs on
[18:29] my heart
[18:30] and uh so the boy is completely you know
[18:33] he's
[18:35] uh you know he's not conscious he's he's
[18:38] on the bed he has bald head he's about
[18:41] 10 years old
[18:42] and so i went in there and began to
[18:46] talk with him even though maybe he
[18:47] couldn't hear me i began to talk with
[18:49] them
[18:50] and so i put this the prayer cloth in
[18:52] his hand
[18:54] and i began to talk with him and i began
[18:57] to sing these songs to him
[18:58] and then i felt his little hand like
[19:01] squeeze that
[19:02] prayer cloth and it was just a and and
[19:06] it was wonderful because several months
[19:08] later i asked how the boy was and
[19:10] so the doctors basically gave him up uh
[19:13] just
[19:14] um as brain dead you know and so several
[19:17] months later i talked to his granddad
[19:18] again he said he's up
[19:20] he's running around he's on his computer
[19:22] playing and he's he's
[19:24] miraculously healed so so this is the
[19:26] two specials that i sing for him but
[19:29] but i need help if you could sing with
[19:32] [Music]
[19:36] me
[19:38] [Music]

[23:15] he'll carry us
[23:18] when we can't
[23:23] [Music]
[23:35] if strength is perfect
[23:38] [Music]
[23:40] history is
[23:45] safe i can do all things
[23:51] through christ that gives me friends
[23:56] times i wonder what he
[23:59] can do
[24:10] no glory of my own
[24:14] yet my weakness there
[24:18] to let me know
[24:22] his strength is gone

[24:37] carry on
[24:41] raising his power
[24:44] [Music]
[24:50] his strength is perfect
[24:55] his strength is
[25:00] strength is perfect
[25:03] when our strength is gone
[25:09] he'll carry us when we can't
[25:14] carry on
[25:18] raising his power
[25:22] that we become strong
[25:28] strength is perfect
[25:32] his strength is purple
[25:37] his strength is perfect
[25:44] [Music]
[25:49] when we can carry on
[25:56] in his power
[25:59] though we become strong

[26:26] all on the lord today you know it's
[26:30] unsettling times that we're in but yet

[26:35] it all
[26:37] and i rejoice in that i truly mean that
[26:40] with all of my heart amen we're going to

[27:09] [Music]
[27:12] i wish to by the help of the lord begin
[27:15] what will likely be
[27:17] a two-part sermon i feel quite certain i
[27:20] can't
[27:21] get to it all today and so we're
[27:24] we're not really going to try to do that
[27:27] amen

[27:55] this know also that in the last days you
[27:59] believe we're there
[28:01] perilous times shall come
[28:04] here's a prophecy for men or mankind
[28:08] humanity for men shall be lovers of
[28:11] their own selves
[28:13] covetous boasters proud blasphemers
[28:18] disobedient to parents unthankful
[28:21] unholy without natural affection
[28:25] truce breakers false accusers
[28:28] incontinent
[28:29] fierce despisers of those that are good
[28:33] traitors heady high-minded
[28:37] lovers of pleasure more than lovers
[28:41] of god amen let's pray
[28:46] father we thank you for your word that's
[28:48] been read this morning

[28:51] worship and the people in attendance
[28:53] father i pray your great blessing be
[28:55] upon speaker and hearer hearers both
[28:58] here live and hearers across the stream
[29:01] father we commit ourselves into your
[29:03] hands today
[29:04] if we're if there was ever an hour where
[29:07] we need you to be
[29:08] in 100 percent control of every
[29:11] aspect of our lives it's this day this
[29:14] hour this moment lord we need you more
[29:17] than ever before
[29:19] so we commit ourselves to you now for
[29:21] service lord to assist you to bring the
[29:23] word
[29:24] in jesus name amen god bless your
[29:27] friends you can be seated
[29:33] now for some reason on my remote app
[29:37] um brother kevin i don't see the
[29:38] connection so it's okay
[29:40] i'll let you guys run it uh from the
[29:43] back
[29:44] amen we're not going to worry about
[29:46] technology today
[29:48] amen this is an hour where we just want
[29:50] to have our minds constant
[29:52] concentrated on the word you believe
[29:54] that
[29:55] amen and allow the lord to bring it to
[29:58] us
[29:59] in the way that he chooses the anointed
[30:03] kingdom amen um
[30:06] if you will just give me my first title
[30:08] slide
[30:09] um brother gideon god bless you i'm
[30:12] happy to see that handsome face back
[30:14] there today
[30:15] amen i mean all y'all they're handsome
[30:17] too so i'm just amen
[30:20] amen praise the lord the anointed
[30:22] kingdom
[30:23] colossians 1 27 this is a just a quick
[30:27] reference
[30:28] because i want to take that as a
[30:29] subtitle christ
[30:31] in you and brother branham
[30:35] is going to make a statement here
[30:39] um first next slide for the gideon
[30:42] he says in the message called out 1958
[30:46] now i want you to to be aware of how
[30:49] he's going to word this
[30:51] because he's talking about the time um
[30:54] at belted chasers feast at the end of
[30:58] the
[30:58] babylonian kingdom and they bring in
[31:01] daniel to interpret writing on the wall
[31:04] me name taco you farsen
[31:06] and it means you've been weighed in the
[31:08] balance and found wanting now don't read
[31:10] ahead of me just pay attention right
[31:11] here first
[31:12] um that is a direct
[31:15] direct correlation to this hour
[31:18] that's where we are all right so
[31:22] now let's look at brother branham in
[31:24] this statement here he says i pray
[31:26] eternal blessed god that just
[31:29] at this moment that you'll send your
[31:32] spirit in such a blast
[31:34] that it'll shake the sin shackles of
[31:37] unbelief away from this audience
[31:40] wouldn't that be a wonderful thing today
[31:42] amen can you say lord this audience
[31:46] and may they be filled just now with
[31:49] faith say amen and power
[31:53] right that they may be healed
[31:57] now watch him address the devil satan
[32:00] your days are numbered
[32:04] your kingdom now that's an important
[32:06] point uh and don't switch to latia g man
[32:09] your kingdom has been numbered
[32:14] you're weighed in the balance and found
[32:17] wanting
[32:18] so now he's literally going to take this
[32:22] passage from a true story
[32:25] in the old testament as it relates to
[32:28] the time
[32:29] where israel was in captivity to the
[32:32] babylonians they were about to be
[32:34] overrun by the medo-persian empire they
[32:37] didn't realize it that
[32:39] while they're there in their drunken
[32:41] festival
[32:43] disrespecting the articles from the
[32:45] temple of the lord
[32:47] using the very cups and using the very
[32:50] instruments
[32:51] that had been dedicated to god by
[32:53] solomon
[32:54] and they're making a mockery of god's
[32:57] vessels
[32:58] amen that's an important point and
[33:01] and they're they're they're the the
[33:04] interpretation
[33:05] is that your weight in the balance this
[33:09] kingdom
[33:10] belted chaser your kingdom has been
[33:12] weighed in the balance
[33:14] and is found wanting and even now
[33:17] while the prophecy is going forward to
[33:20] you
[33:21] right while the interpretation of the
[33:24] word
[33:25] is being declared to you by a prophet
[33:28] the enemy has already gone under your
[33:31] defenses
[33:32] and has breached your defenses and you
[33:34] don't realize it
[33:36] you're already under invasion
[33:39] and in a matter of no time you're all
[33:41] going to be dead
[33:43] now that hour has repeat
[33:46] has repeated so so we find then
[33:50] that the sign and this is an important
[33:53] point as i get started
[33:55] that the sign in the days of daniel
[33:59] was a pronouncement on this
[34:02] age at the end time he says your kingdom
[34:06] your kingdom has been numbered not
[34:07] people this is not
[34:09] god coming down at the end time and just
[34:12] saying
[34:12] oh you know you've got a bad person in
[34:15] this position
[34:16] there's a bad politician or a bad
[34:19] preacher
[34:20] or a bad school teacher or you know
[34:23] somebody with social influence
[34:25] this isn't individuals this is now an
[34:27] entire kingdom
[34:30] is about to crumble and we're
[34:34] living in the days of the kingdom
[34:37] of the devil but i want to introduce to
[34:40] you today
[34:41] that there's an anointed kingdom
[34:44] anointed and anointed of god
[34:46] who is here today right now
[34:50] in satan's eden to resist that kingdom
[34:52] of the enemy
[34:54] it is our job as it was in daniel's day
[34:58] to interpret the word to the people say
[35:01] but i'm not daniel i'm not a prophet i
[35:03] can't interpret
[35:04] unknown writings don't worry it's been
[35:06] done for you
[35:08] the unknown writing the cryptic passages
[35:10] the mystery the prophecies
[35:12] have been made known by a prophet and
[35:14] given to you
[35:15] and now now the ministry not the office
[35:18] the office of son of man and william
[35:20] branham went home
[35:21] but the ministry of the son of man which
[35:24] is christ in you
[35:25] living in flesh that's here now and that
[35:28] makes this a
[35:29] son of man ministry and that's a
[35:30] prophetic ministry
[35:32] so don't ever think that you're less
[35:35] empowered
[35:36] because brother branham has gone home
[35:38] i'm here to tell you his homegoing
[35:40] more empowered you because it just as
[35:44] john was an anointed word for his day
[35:47] john the baptist standing in the water
[35:49] was christ
[35:50] just like jeremiah in his day was christ
[35:53] because christ means the anointed word
[35:56] and when the anointed word is made
[35:58] manifest then you then then that's a
[36:01] christ
[36:01] that's an anointed word that's a living
[36:04] representative
[36:05] of god now living in a human being
[36:08] amen so then when john i'll ask you this
[36:11] question
[36:13] was it was it did god
[36:17] get overran by the devil when john
[36:20] was executed in prison not at all
[36:25] god wasn't overran god didn't have to go
[36:27] back to the drawing board when john
[36:30] perished had his head taken off of him
[36:32] prophets have suffered that kind of
[36:34] grizzly ends you know time immemorial
[36:39] and we find that but it was a perfect
[36:42] transition because the anointed word had
[36:45] to go from the prophet
[36:47] to christ jesus the word now alive
[36:50] and there was a prophet in our day but
[36:52] i'm here to tell you something friends
[36:53] that same anointing didn't leave the
[36:55] bride it empowers the bride
[36:58] to be the final voice we understand that
[37:01] amen
[37:03] so now we find that there is a
[37:07] kingdom of christ and there is a kingdom
[37:10] of antichrist
[37:11] and the kingdom of christ is to oppose
[37:15] the kingdom of the antichrist and to
[37:17] declare
[37:18] the hidden mystery that's what daniel
[37:21] did
[37:22] he declared a hidden mystery
[37:25] amen so we declare what a prophet has
[37:29] said
[37:30] but more importantly than that
[37:34] we declare the prophet's words
[37:38] made alive in us listen if all your
[37:41] if all you can do is declare
[37:45] what god did in the life of william
[37:47] branham and you don't have that same
[37:49] declaration
[37:50] in your life then all you're doing is
[37:52] declaring history
[37:55] you're just you're just recounting a
[37:57] historical event
[37:59] you know that you you you don't move
[38:01] devils that way
[38:02] the sons of skeva tried that because
[38:05] they had
[38:06] they had been to church they had heard
[38:08] paul preach they believed it
[38:09] and they came against a man possessed of
[38:11] devils and said we adjure you
[38:13] by by the by jesus whom paul preaches
[38:16] and the devil
[38:17] wasn't bothered by that and engaged them
[38:19] back since they decided to engage him
[38:21] he engaged them back jesus i know know
[38:24] him quite well
[38:24] paul yep know him too i don't really
[38:26] know you guys
[38:29] there's nothing about you that worries
[38:32] me
[38:33] there's nothing in your life that
[38:34] resembles paul
[38:36] there's nothing happening in your
[38:38] ministry that resembles jesus
[38:39] so i'm not really afraid of you you
[38:42] understand
[38:43] so the the message of the hour
[38:46] cannot must not and cannot be limited
[38:50] to just a historical reference that you
[38:52] can tell somebody about
[38:53] and even quote quotes to them it's got
[38:55] to be a living quote
[38:57] it's got to come from the voice of your
[38:59] life
[39:01] that is the voice that is the anointed
[39:04] kingdom
[39:05] that is here to confront the enemy
[39:10] so i say again the sign in the days of
[39:14] daniel was a pronouncement
[39:17] on this age of the end time the world
[39:20] let me say it like this the world is
[39:24] largely unaware that they are being led
[39:29] by a spiritual kingdom amen
[39:32] you can talk to them about it and you
[39:34] can see right away people's like
[39:36] they don't even want to talk about
[39:36] spiritual things you can't even get them
[39:39] they'll talk about politics
[39:43] they'll talk about they'll talk about
[39:45] who their favorite sports team is
[39:47] they'll talk about great education and
[39:50] you can get the right kind of person
[39:51] and who's a scientist and get them
[39:53] talking about quantum mechanics man
[39:54] they'll talk all day long
[39:57] but when you immediately begin to turn
[39:59] and say you know there's another kingdom
[40:00] we need to talk about
[40:02] it's not a kingdom of education it's not
[40:03] a kingdom of politics not a kingdom of
[40:05] social issues
[40:06] we're going to talk about a god that is
[40:08] in control
[40:09] and another enemy that's in control
[40:11] who's also a supernatural being and
[40:13] right away they don't want to talk about
[40:14] that
[40:16] but what is what is tragic
[40:19] what is tragic is they don't want to
[40:23] talk about
[40:24] the most important point
[40:27] that is the most important point
[40:30] that satan has become
[40:33] the controlling god of this
[40:36] entire age which it takes in politics
[40:41] and education and social issues it takes
[40:44] in
[40:44] everything satan is the ruling
[40:48] spiritual force or energy
[40:51] our fuel our characteristics are
[40:54] anointing
[40:56] behind everything that we see
[40:59] in the world today and the sad reality
[41:03] is that just as belted shazer was
[41:05] unaware of that
[41:07] this age is largely unaware of that and
[41:10] even
[41:10] in denial it's a kingdom of darkness
[41:13] i'm here to tell you friends the age i'm
[41:15] not here to preach doom and gloom
[41:16] i'm actually here to say you know look
[41:19] up your redemption draweth nigh
[41:21] but the bottom line is for us the
[41:24] reality is
[41:25] that that this is a kingdom of darkness
[41:28] and in fact
[41:29] is it is the greatest darkness the world
[41:31] has ever experienced
[41:37] they were disrespecting the articles
[41:41] from the house of the lord
[41:45] you know it's incredible that
[41:49] so much is made on the political front
[41:51] today and
[41:52] social issues of injustice and social
[41:55] justice and marches and
[41:57] and and demonstrations and riotings and
[42:00] different things like that and
[42:02] even even good and noble ideologies
[42:05] being hijacked
[42:06] being hijacked by lucifer being hijacked
[42:10] by
[42:10] a fallen agenda actually and that's not
[42:14] new that was that was happening
[42:16] you know it's been it's been happening
[42:17] you know for decades
[42:19] that you can rise up with a very valid
[42:22] and noble
[42:22] to say hey this is something we need to
[42:24] pay attention and if you gain any
[42:26] traction in that
[42:28] right away forces of evil go there's an
[42:30] opportunity and they'll jump right on it
[42:33] and write it into pinnacle political
[42:35] notoriety
[42:37] until they've taken the movement and
[42:39] completely adulterated it from what it
[42:41] was
[42:42] and it's beginning we're seeing it
[42:43] happen come on friends let's not be
[42:45] let's not be awkward i mean this is the
[42:47] reality hey come on we're not we're not
[42:49] political we're christians
[42:51] do i need to go all that down that again
[42:53] i'm not a i'm not a democrat or a
[42:55] republican
[42:57] amen i i'm not white or black i'm a son
[43:01] of god
[43:02] come on and then paul said there's
[43:04] there's no there's
[43:05] neither jew nor greek male or female
[43:08] it's not about that in the kingdom of
[43:10] god
[43:10] we're christians i don't even this isn't
[43:12] even my country
[43:14] i'm an ambassador from another country
[43:16] to come to this country to say
[43:18] hey you guys got a serious problem and i
[43:20] got a good answer for you if you'll take
[43:22] it
[43:24] amen so we start you know
[43:27] preachers in the message certainly
[43:29] shouldn't feel awkward to talk about
[43:30] social issues
[43:32] and to say you know that the devil's in
[43:34] control of it all if you're a believer
[43:36] you believe that because the bible
[43:38] said it would be and you see it amen
[43:43] so we find that the things that they're
[43:47] even even the things that they are
[43:49] legitimately and rightfully protesting
[43:52] those things don't even exist in the
[43:53] family of god
[43:55] there's no need for you to protest about
[43:58] racial equality if you're a christian
[44:00] because christians it doesn't matter
[44:02] what race you are
[44:04] there's no need to protest it for gender
[44:06] inequality if you're a christian
[44:08] it doesn't matter because there's no we
[44:10] don't treat our women like that
[44:12] amen come on loosen up come on amen
[44:16] come on let's throw that awkwardness out
[44:18] the door where it's supposed to be
[44:20] we have a right to talk about what
[44:22] prophecy said would be here
[44:24] and we have a right to identify it
[44:26] modern events
[44:27] are made clear by prophecy
[44:30] all right all right so
[44:35] in the name of social justice
[44:39] they felt the need to burn bibles in
[44:43] portland
[44:46] next slide g
[44:51] that's from a news source that's a bible
[44:55] burning
[44:59] next one there's a whole stack of them
[45:03] burning
[45:06] so why would they burn bibles that
[45:09] doesn't even make
[45:10] sense if anything gives equality and
[45:14] justice to all mankind it's the bible
[45:17] why would they burn the book that stands
[45:20] for all people
[45:21] that this is you know what this book
[45:22] declares that god so
[45:24] loved the whole world he gave his son to
[45:27] die for
[45:28] it this is the book that tells husbands
[45:31] love your wives as christ loved the
[45:33] church this is the
[45:34] this is the book that says there is no
[45:36] jew or greek there is no
[45:38] there is no male or female that in
[45:40] christ we're all one
[45:42] this is the book that that tells you to
[45:44] be honest and decent
[45:46] and loyal and and humble this is the
[45:48] book that tells you to love your
[45:50] neighbor
[45:51] this is the book that tells you to obey
[45:54] governments and
[45:55] and don't be righteous this is the book
[45:57] that teaches families
[45:58] how to be in sync and in harmony this is
[46:00] the book that that that they use
[46:03] to join men and women in marriage
[46:06] and this is the book that instructs
[46:07] parents how to raise a decent
[46:10] moral honest upstanding people
[46:14] and that's the book they burn
[46:17] i've said it often before you can tell
[46:19] when you're being anointed by
[46:21] an evil spirit because you'll do things
[46:22] that don't even make sense
[46:26] why would they burn bibles
[46:31] and if if i that's that's a scaled down
[46:34] picture if i
[46:35] expanded that picture you'd see
[46:38] people sitting on the ground around it
[46:41] watching it
[46:42] holding up their signs holding up their
[46:45] signs
[46:48] justice equality blm
[46:53] women's rights equal pay and they're
[46:56] holding up their signs
[46:58] while they're watching the bibles burn
[47:02] say explain that madness to me brother
[47:04] jason it's easy
[47:05] go back to daniel standing there and the
[47:07] king
[47:08] def defiling the articles of the lord's
[47:12] house
[47:12] and def why would they need to go and
[47:15] get
[47:16] articles why did about the shazer feel
[47:18] the need he had plenty of
[47:20] wine goblets and had plenty of articles
[47:22] why did he feel the need
[47:24] to go and get the ones that had been
[47:26] dedicated to jehovah
[47:29] it doesn't make sense but what what
[47:32] makes it makes sense
[47:33] is when you realize that a demon power
[47:36] was anointing him
[47:37] and a demon powers anointing that
[47:42] amen
[47:50] so we find next slide brother gideon
[47:55] watch brother branham come here
[48:00] and take up take up this statement does
[48:03] god ever change his mind about his word
[48:07] and now we find always that when these
[48:10] natural and spiritual
[48:11] spirits of churches and organizations
[48:14] meet
[48:14] there is always a clash it's never
[48:18] failed to be so it always clashes
[48:22] notice abel by faith in god offered a
[48:24] more excellent sacrifice
[48:26] and the carnal believer thought that it
[48:28] was the works of his own hands
[48:30] that and his fruits and his beautiful
[48:32] offering that he brought that god would
[48:34] recognize
[48:35] and it made a clash
[48:39] now it's interesting that that there
[48:42] it's the only place that i've found
[48:44] there might be others
[48:45] it's the only place that i found where
[48:48] they were burning bibles
[48:50] they've been burning flags but portland
[48:52] seems to be the only place i can find
[48:53] not that that's a big point
[48:55] they might be burning them in other
[48:56] cities as well but but it seems to be as
[48:59] far as i can track on the news feeds
[49:01] it seems to be that portland was where
[49:03] it first started
[49:05] now that's interesting to me because we
[49:08] realize
[49:10] that that it was it was exactly
[49:13] uh portland where the maniac jumped on
[49:16] the platform
[49:18] to strike brother branham
[49:22] i'm going to tell you something that man
[49:24] is probably long gone but those demons
[49:26] are still there and it's not
[49:31] and it has nothing to do with
[49:33] inequalities
[49:34] because first of all in portland the
[49:37] main ones rioting are white people
[49:40] i i heard a i heard a a a very well
[49:43] informed man
[49:44] referencing he lives in detroit he says
[49:46] he says you know we don't even have that
[49:48] in detroit where we really are oppressed
[49:52] and he says he says the average income
[49:55] he says we're we're in detroit looking
[49:57] at portland going what is your problem
[50:00] our our average income is 40 000.
[50:03] your average income is 140 000 portland
[50:07] our average homes are about 80 grand
[50:10] your average homes are four hundred
[50:12] thousand what what are you writing about
[50:17] and you got people in detroit people of
[50:19] color who don't get it
[50:22] and want to say good grief portland what
[50:25] are you also up in the air about you
[50:26] you've got riches you've got wealth
[50:29] you're upwardly mobile
[50:32] you see friends it doesn't make sense it
[50:34] proves that it's a kingdom of darkness
[50:38] don't be fooled don't think it's
[50:40] religious don't think that it's social
[50:42] liberty and social justice has nothing
[50:44] to do with that
[50:45] if they really wanted true equality they
[50:47] wouldn't burn this
[50:50] i'm trying to say why you keep hammering
[50:52] this because i'm trying to show you
[50:54] that the world is being controlled
[50:55] there's a kingdom of darkness and
[50:57] control
[50:58] and there has to be a contrast to that
[51:00] and that's the kingdom of light
[51:01] the kingdom of sons and daughters of god
[51:03] and i happen to believe we're it
[51:08] if they're going to demonstrate why am i
[51:10] not demonstrating
[51:12] i'm not talking about carrying signs in
[51:13] the street i'm talking about when i go
[51:15] into walmart or target
[51:17] when i go into the grocery store when
[51:18] you go into the schools where you go
[51:20] wherever you are
[51:20] your life ought to be a sign you ought
[51:22] to be a demonstration
[51:24] hey there's a kingdom of light
[51:30] we find that this man in portland this
[51:34] maniac
[51:36] that he could not be delivered of that
[51:39] spirit now he got bound
[51:42] by a prophet's words you'll fall at my
[51:44] feet because
[51:46] for no other reason not because you're a
[51:47] bad guy
[51:50] not because of something you did but so
[51:52] because of something you're doing right
[51:53] at this minute
[51:54] you're challenging the servant of the
[51:56] most high god
[51:58] and that that don't work for the holy
[52:00] ghost
[52:01] so brother branham said satan made a
[52:03] challenge and the holy ghost accepted
[52:04] the challenge
[52:06] and said because you've done this you'll
[52:08] fall at my feet and that's exactly what
[52:10] happened
[52:10] and he fell across brother brown's feet
[52:13] and the
[52:14] the police had to come then and pry him
[52:17] off
[52:18] and uh and one of the head policemen
[52:20] asked the question
[52:22] brother branham says is he dead and
[52:25] brother branham says no
[52:28] he says is he delivered and he says no
[52:30] he worships that thing and he won't give
[52:32] it up
[52:36] so i want you to fully absorb the scene
[52:40] this is in a city of portland where a
[52:43] maniac
[52:44] could not be delivered because of his
[52:49] love for the spirit of the world
[52:53] he loved the kingdom of darkness
[52:57] more than lovers of god did not we read
[53:00] that
[53:01] in our text
[53:04] traitors heady high-minded
[53:08] lovers of pleasure more than lovers of
[53:10] god
[53:11] and here comes god ready to deliver him
[53:14] and god even can't deliver him
[53:18] because he's in love with the spirit
[53:21] of the world
[53:25] people don't see themselves
[53:29] becoming maniac
[53:33] when they are lovers of pleasure more
[53:34] than lovers of god
[53:38] they don't see that happening they
[53:42] they discount paul's warning
[53:47] of what the consequences of
[53:50] loving the world more than you love god
[53:53] paul
[53:53] lists some some very striking
[53:57] definitive and definite consequences
[54:00] that happen to you when you follow that
[54:04] path
[54:05] of loving the pleasures of the world
[54:07] more than you love god's word
[54:09] when you're more when you're when you
[54:11] see say how do i know if i'm
[54:12] if i'm doing that what's your life
[54:14] displaying if your life is displaying
[54:16] more
[54:16] of the comforts of this laodicean age
[54:18] more than it's displaying the
[54:20] separateness
[54:21] of the holy ghost in your life then
[54:23] you've got a love problem
[54:26] come on see you can't
[54:29] i mean you can deny it in your mind all
[54:31] day long but i'm looking at the fruit
[54:33] that's growing
[54:35] you know man can come to me and say hey
[54:36] come to my backyard i want to show you a
[54:38] great apple tree i planted and it's
[54:39] growing nice apples and i get there and
[54:41] it's growing bananas
[54:43] and i have to say to the guy i'm sorry
[54:45] you didn't plant apple seed
[54:46] oh yes i did no you didn't i know i did
[54:49] i read the label i don't care what you
[54:51] read i got a scripture i got a quote i
[54:53] don't care what quote you got
[54:55] i don't care what scriptures daisy chain
[54:58] all the scriptures and quotes you want
[55:00] but i'm here to tell you i know you
[55:02] didn't plant apple seed
[55:05] because had you planted apple seed the
[55:07] laws of nature would have produced
[55:08] apples and it's not
[55:10] it's growing bananas you planted a seed
[55:12] of discrepancy is what you planted
[55:14] thinking you were planting apple seeds
[55:18] so you know you you can claim all day
[55:21] long but when the evidence is in your
[55:23] life
[55:24] that that that that that your life
[55:26] predominantly
[55:28] chases after the pleasures of this world
[55:32] more than say when i love god i believe
[55:34] the word i'm not talking about
[55:36] that you do or you don't i'm saying paul
[55:37] said lovers of pleasure more than lovers
[55:40] of god
[55:42] and there were very dire consequences
[55:45] just like
[55:46] side effects you take a certain
[55:48] medication and it'll they'll tell you
[55:50] right on the label
[55:50] this could happen this could happen this
[55:52] could happen this could happen they've
[55:53] happened to people clinical trials we
[55:54] know that
[55:55] blindness can occur deafness numbness
[55:57] nausea
[55:58] fainting dizziness all these different
[56:00] things can happen you could it could
[56:02] cause you to become anemic
[56:03] and wow i don't know if i want to take
[56:04] this medicine that's always a gamble
[56:08] it's always a risk that you might be one
[56:10] of the unlucky ones
[56:12] the problem that when people are feeding
[56:14] off seeds of discrepancy of the world
[56:16] is is it's not going to be a roll of the
[56:18] dice everybody's going to get the side
[56:20] effects
[56:22] and you're not going to get one of them
[56:23] you're going to get all of them and
[56:24] that's what paul
[56:25] is is saying here people
[56:28] they don't feel they they they don't see
[56:31] themselves becoming
[56:33] maniac when they start loving the
[56:36] pleasures
[56:37] of the world more than lovers of god
[56:40] they don't
[56:40] you know what happens they don't feel
[56:43] paul warned them of this
[56:44] but they don't feel their natural
[56:46] affection leaving
[56:49] they don't sense it but paul
[56:52] says that's going to be one of the
[56:53] consequences you'll lose natural
[56:55] affection
[56:56] as strange as
[57:00] as a as their natural affection goes
[57:04] a strange fierceness settles in its
[57:07] place
[57:08] this is paul's warning in second timothy
[57:13] fierce traitor heady high minded
[57:16] without natural affection truth
[57:17] spreaders false accusers incontinent
[57:19] fierce despisers of those that are good
[57:21] people don't see themselves getting to
[57:23] there but paul is simply saying hey
[57:26] those are the side effects every time
[57:28] you love the world more than you love
[57:30] god
[57:32] they don't see themselves becoming
[57:34] maniac they don't
[57:36] they don't detect the their natural
[57:38] affection is leaving
[57:39] they don't sense that it's being
[57:41] replaced by a fierceness
[57:43] that it begins to take over their mind
[57:45] and they become
[57:46] more heady and more heady and more
[57:49] high-minded
[57:50] and more high-minded
[57:54] they don't realize that that's happening
[57:56] to them
[57:58] there was only one power that could
[58:01] subdue
[58:02] that maniac in portland oregon
[58:05] and i first want to tell you what could
[58:07] not subdue it
[58:08] civilized law had failed to subdue
[58:12] that maniac the courts had failed the
[58:15] police
[58:16] had failed he had been arrested he had
[58:19] been in court
[58:20] he had been in jail civilized law had
[58:24] failed
[58:25] he's jumping on the platform to strike
[58:27] brother branham
[58:28] the police were there they had failed
[58:32] the courts had failed both republican
[58:35] and democratic parties had failed
[58:38] amen psychiatrists
[58:42] had failed social workers had failed
[58:45] that man had had all of that
[58:48] no they had all failed this man was put
[58:51] under control of the word
[58:52] speaking through a dedicated vessel and
[58:55] that's the only thing that could bring
[58:56] him
[58:57] under subjection because he confronted
[59:02] a dedicated vessel it was not brother
[59:05] branham just being a prophet of the age
[59:08] that did it
[59:09] i'm here to tell you that if if the same
[59:11] christ that lived in brother branham
[59:13] lives in you
[59:14] as a son and daughter of god you also
[59:16] have authority over the
[59:18] powers of the enemy do you believe that
[59:21] so we find that it was a that it was a
[59:24] vessel
[59:24] who was familiar with the power of god
[59:27] and the power of the holy ghost
[59:29] it was a word catch this now what did
[59:32] that maniac hear
[59:33] that sent him to the floor he heard a
[59:36] word
[59:37] spoken from a word life on display
[59:40] and it stopped him in his tracks
[59:46] what in politics wasn't the cops wasn't
[59:48] social workers a psychiatrist
[59:50] what medication wasn't politics
[59:55] it was a spoken word there was a vessel
[59:58] standing there
[1:00:00] that was a reflector of the word
[1:00:03] there was a vessel standing there that
[1:00:06] had the word
[1:00:07] on display in his life and spoke a word
[1:00:10] to that maniac and dropped him
[1:00:13] when no other power could drop him as
[1:00:15] brother branham says
[1:00:16] there's there is always a clash
[1:00:20] notice again in our quote abel by faith
[1:00:23] in god
[1:00:23] offered a more excellent sacrifice and
[1:00:26] the carnal believer
[1:00:28] thought that it was the works of his own
[1:00:29] hands and his fruits and his beautiful
[1:00:32] offering that he
[1:00:32] that he brought and that would that god
[1:00:35] would recognize
[1:00:36] and it made a clash
[1:00:40] next slide
[1:00:44] we find that abraham
[1:00:47] and lot had a clash we find
[1:00:50] that moses and nathan and cara had the
[1:00:53] same clash
[1:00:55] see there was a clash when the carnal
[1:00:58] and the spiritual meets
[1:01:01] there's always a clash do you know one
[1:01:04] of the biggest
[1:01:06] clash flash moments
[1:01:09] that happen in a church service
[1:01:13] is when the word comes forth spiritual
[1:01:16] and somebody carnal resists it there
[1:01:19] comes a clash in the atmosphere
[1:01:22] see see there was a clash
[1:01:26] when the carnal and the spiritual meets
[1:01:29] there is always a clash
[1:01:32] when judas and jesus met there was a
[1:01:36] clash
[1:01:36] one the son of god the other one
[1:01:39] the son of satan
[1:01:43] just like cain and abel there was a
[1:01:46] clash
[1:01:47] when they met next slide with job
[1:01:52] one of them was the treasurer of the
[1:01:53] church the other one
[1:01:56] a pastor and as now we come in this day
[1:02:00] to the same thing again the carnal
[1:02:03] denomination to the spiritual bride
[1:02:06] of christ see the spiritual bride of
[1:02:10] christ
[1:02:11] is so much different from the carnal
[1:02:14] organizations
[1:02:16] till there's no comparison in them that
[1:02:19] at all go to that blank slide next and
[1:02:22] just
[1:02:23] hover right there so the spiritual bride
[1:02:27] of christ
[1:02:28] is so much different i'm you know let me
[1:02:31] i
[1:02:31] you know i think i could say it this way
[1:02:35] we're supposed to be
[1:02:38] where there should be so much separation
[1:02:42] uh between the spiritual and the carnal
[1:02:45] and and i'm gonna here to tell you
[1:02:46] friends when if and when we don't
[1:02:50] see the power of god like it ought to be
[1:02:53] and i'm talking about
[1:02:54] power over darkness power over sin power
[1:02:57] over the devil power over sickness
[1:02:59] when we don't see that at the level that
[1:03:01] we believe we should see it
[1:03:03] say what should be our level it should
[1:03:05] be over the top at this point
[1:03:07] this is the return of the ministry of
[1:03:09] jesus christ
[1:03:10] it should be complete authority over
[1:03:13] every devil in our homes and in our
[1:03:15] lives and in our families
[1:03:16] and we don't see it why because there's
[1:03:18] not enough separation
[1:03:22] come on and on it what's on it
[1:03:25] there's no i don't have another bible
[1:03:27] answer for you
[1:03:28] that's a you that's a great question
[1:03:30] that mankind needs to ask
[1:03:32] why do we not see if if god before us
[1:03:35] where's all the miracles
[1:03:38] that's a common question and the answer
[1:03:40] that the bible gives is
[1:03:42] it will be if there's enough separation
[1:03:45] between spiritual and carnal
[1:03:46] because i'm here to tell you the devil
[1:03:47] ain't worried about your intellect he's
[1:03:49] worried about the word being on display
[1:03:53] and the word cannot be on display in
[1:03:55] your lives when you choose
[1:03:57] the world and you love it more than you
[1:03:59] love
[1:04:01] the things of god
[1:04:04] you know i was thinking the other day
[1:04:05] about the word of god being on display
[1:04:07] and i just said lord
[1:04:10] let your word come to pass in my life
[1:04:17] i study the word constantly
[1:04:21] intellectually you know sometimes i
[1:04:24] shock my own self i get
[1:04:28] i know that might sound arrogant let me
[1:04:30] let me let me clarify that real quick
[1:04:33] sometimes i get asked a question i i it
[1:04:36] happened this recently i was on a
[1:04:37] call in bible study that i'm on every
[1:04:39] morning and
[1:04:40] a brother asked me a question off off
[1:04:42] the cuff i wasn't expecting it i didn't
[1:04:44] have any notes prepared for it
[1:04:46] and and he he said
[1:04:49] he said i got a question for you brother
[1:04:50] jason you know why does the bible say
[1:04:52] this this this and this
[1:04:54] and suddenly i realized wow
[1:04:57] i remember studying that very question
[1:04:59] and it was in my memory
[1:05:01] and i was able just to spit it right out
[1:05:04] and to that brother it sounded amazing
[1:05:06] to me it wasn't amazing at all and i
[1:05:07] realized
[1:05:08] goodness gracious i study all the time i
[1:05:10] ought to have a quick answer
[1:05:12] i ought to be able don't you agree i
[1:05:15] ought to be able
[1:05:16] to have a good answer for a good bible
[1:05:19] question i read it day and night
[1:05:21] i study it day and night what brother
[1:05:22] brown i remember saying about this i
[1:05:23] ought to have some kind of an answer
[1:05:25] i've been listening to tapes multiple
[1:05:26] tapes you know in a week i would hate to
[1:05:29] count how many quotes and tapes
[1:05:31] and scriptures that i'm looking at and
[1:05:33] commentary my whole life is a life of
[1:05:35] quiet contemplation
[1:05:38] oh life is that all through the day from
[1:05:41] early morning hours
[1:05:42] and all through the day and and into the
[1:05:45] evening but you know
[1:05:46] as i sit there and think about that i
[1:05:49] when i look in the mirror and i'm not
[1:05:52] talking about the mirror i looked at
[1:05:53] in the back office to make sure my hair
[1:05:55] was combed right my tie was straight
[1:05:57] i'm talking about that mirror talking
[1:05:59] about this mirror
[1:06:00] when i look in this mirror i go wow my
[1:06:04] my intellect is way outpacing my
[1:06:06] demonstration
[1:06:07] and i don't like that i don't like that
[1:06:11] because i know there's a kingdom of
[1:06:12] darkness
[1:06:13] and it's not being outpaced i'm here to
[1:06:15] tell you it's on display everywhere and
[1:06:17] i say lord god
[1:06:18] let your word don't fill me with more
[1:06:20] knowledge let your word
[1:06:21] come to pass in my life let it live let
[1:06:24] my life
[1:06:24] be a living testimony of the written
[1:06:27] word
[1:06:28] that's what i desire today that's what
[1:06:30] the anointed kingdom
[1:06:33] is all about
[1:06:40] i thought to myself and this was just my
[1:06:43] own musing
[1:06:45] my own thought bubbles as i've been
[1:06:47] studying this thought for
[1:06:49] this these notes here are weeks old
[1:06:52] as i've just been pondering them and i
[1:06:54] thought if i don't have a word
[1:06:58] life
[1:07:00] what do i have
[1:07:04] and i thought wow that's a good question
[1:07:06] i need to think on that and i've spent
[1:07:08] two weeks thinking about it
[1:07:09] and i thought if i don't have
[1:07:13] a word life then what kind of life
[1:07:17] do i have i'm here to tell you something
[1:07:21] friends here can i give you some of my
[1:07:22] answers that i answered myself
[1:07:25] i asked myself the question and i gave
[1:07:27] myself some answers
[1:07:30] if you don't have the person of truth
[1:07:32] not the doctrine
[1:07:35] not the not the data if you don't have
[1:07:39] the person of truth
[1:07:41] then you're left with the great liar
[1:07:44] there's only two
[1:07:47] there's truth and truth isn't data jesus
[1:07:50] called himself
[1:07:52] the truth so truth is a person
[1:07:56] a lie is a person you understand
[1:08:00] jesus not jesus didn't just stop with
[1:08:03] calling the pharisees liars he pressed
[1:08:07] his case to say
[1:08:09] you're of your father the devil because
[1:08:12] he was a liar from the beginning and i
[1:08:15] see your chip off the old block
[1:08:19] i see that the apple doesn't fall too
[1:08:21] far from the tree you pharisees
[1:08:24] you're a liar you're trying to kill me a
[1:08:27] man who has told you the truth
[1:08:29] you claim abraham but you know what
[1:08:32] abraham never did that
[1:08:36] you're of your father the devil and his
[1:08:38] works you do
[1:08:40] see he says why why can you not
[1:08:43] understand my speech
[1:08:44] why do my words have no place in you see
[1:08:47] because of the origin he was aiming back
[1:08:49] at their origin
[1:08:50] so if you don't have the person of truth
[1:08:53] so if i don't have a word
[1:08:55] life what do i have if i don't have the
[1:08:57] person of truth
[1:08:58] then you're just left with the great
[1:09:00] liar everything he tells you
[1:09:04] everywhere he leads you
[1:09:08] everything he gives you is a lie
[1:09:15] everything he tells you everywhere he
[1:09:17] leads you
[1:09:19] everything he gives you everything you
[1:09:22] acquire
[1:09:23] that doesn't come from god comes from
[1:09:25] him
[1:09:26] and it's based on a lie
[1:09:31] and and and he's he has numerous ways of
[1:09:33] lying he'll either ha
[1:09:34] it'll either be a lie of him of
[1:09:36] commission
[1:09:38] where he's just simply lying to you or
[1:09:41] it'll be a lie of omission where he'll
[1:09:43] entice you with something that's kind of
[1:09:45] partial truth but he won't tell you the
[1:09:47] backside
[1:09:48] of what's going to happen to you if you
[1:09:49] take that
[1:09:51] a poisonous apple tastes great at first
[1:09:58] tastes great at first snow white loved
[1:10:00] that apple
[1:10:02] until it put her down
[1:10:05] see the father of lies
[1:10:09] hear me now especially young people
[1:10:11] listen up
[1:10:12] the father of lies will lead you down
[1:10:16] a path that ends in a disappointment
[1:10:20] so bitter i want you to think for a
[1:10:22] moment today i'm not here to say
[1:10:24] better be careful you'll end up at the
[1:10:26] great judgment bar i'm not even
[1:10:27] preaching about that today
[1:10:28] but we do know that the bible teaches us
[1:10:31] that there's going to be people who
[1:10:34] stand at the great white throne judgment
[1:10:36] and who are condemned to a lake of fire
[1:10:40] that's a true story that's that's
[1:10:43] history before it's history
[1:10:45] that's prophecy that's going to be
[1:10:47] history that's a real event it's
[1:10:49] actually going to happen say oh i don't
[1:10:51] that's terrible i don't want to talk
[1:10:52] about that
[1:10:53] well and neither does the devil want you
[1:10:55] to talk about it
[1:10:56] the devil doesn't want me to talk about
[1:10:58] it but i'm here to talk about it
[1:11:00] the house of god is a house of
[1:11:02] correction i'm here to give you the word
[1:11:03] of god
[1:11:04] as he gave it to me how many want it
[1:11:06] today i'm here to tell you there's going
[1:11:08] to be
[1:11:08] millions tens of billions of people
[1:11:13] who are turned away to the lake of fire
[1:11:16] why
[1:11:16] are they because they followed the liar
[1:11:22] and they didn't take the person of truth
[1:11:25] who came to give him eternal life
[1:11:28] and if you stand there hear me planet
[1:11:31] earth today
[1:11:33] if you stand there and you're convicted
[1:11:36] of that
[1:11:40] we're talking about a disappointment so
[1:11:44] bitter
[1:11:46] a loss listen up
[1:11:50] if the devil is enticing you into the
[1:11:52] world
[1:11:53] you hear me now because we've had we've
[1:11:56] had
[1:11:56] you know i'm glad we've got children
[1:11:58] raised up in godly homes but we've had
[1:12:00] children raised up in godly homes before
[1:12:02] who when they got teenagers went out
[1:12:04] into the world
[1:12:05] blew their life to pieces and today are
[1:12:07] still in the world
[1:12:10] i'm glad for decent raising but unless
[1:12:12] you unless you get the person of truth
[1:12:15] unless you have your own personal
[1:12:17] experience with the word
[1:12:19] which is a person then then
[1:12:22] then what ends up happening is it
[1:12:24] becomes a disappointment at the judgment
[1:12:26] bar
[1:12:27] so bitter in the end say why is it so
[1:12:29] bitter i
[1:12:30] i i think because it's a it's it's a
[1:12:33] loss of what could have been
[1:12:35] that that is so painful the bible says
[1:12:38] they will
[1:12:39] wail and gnash their teeth together
[1:12:41] because i
[1:12:42] i believe that standing there it's going
[1:12:45] to be bad enough that they're about to
[1:12:47] endure the flames of the lake of fire
[1:12:49] which are very real
[1:12:51] but to me to me
[1:12:55] the the the finality
[1:12:59] of what i've missed out on
[1:13:02] and i see perhaps in the background a
[1:13:06] glorious kingdom in a millennial world
[1:13:08] that i could have had
[1:13:11] and that one on the throne tried to deal
[1:13:13] with my life
[1:13:14] and i see a bride from 2000 years and
[1:13:17] and and old testament and new testament
[1:13:19] and i and i see her gathered and they
[1:13:21] made it why did i not make it
[1:13:23] was god prejudice was god biased no i
[1:13:26] was prejudiced i loved the world more
[1:13:28] than i loved him
[1:13:30] the bias was in me
[1:13:37] a loss of what could have been
[1:13:41] so painful a soul-crushing agony
[1:13:46] in your mind so great
[1:13:49] that the mercies of god will finally
[1:13:52] commute your sentence
[1:13:53] from the lake of fire to a plane of
[1:13:58] non-existence
[1:14:00] so that no part of you will ever
[1:14:03] ever exist again
[1:14:07] so you know my message to you today is
[1:14:10] why not take the person of truth
[1:14:14] why follow the great liar why
[1:14:18] follow the madness of the world why
[1:14:20] would you
[1:14:21] do that take the truth
[1:14:24] take the person of truth why not
[1:14:28] follow why would you not follow this
[1:14:30] gentle
[1:14:31] shepherd to a new world oh one who can
[1:14:34] give you
[1:14:35] life here now and and and you know
[1:14:38] something
[1:14:39] you can believe everything he tells you
[1:14:42] isn't that wonderful
[1:14:43] i'm here to tell you that there's a
[1:14:44] being you can believe everything he
[1:14:46] tells you
[1:14:47] you can know confidently that everything
[1:14:50] you're told is true

[1:14:54] everything you're given from the lord
[1:14:56] is for keeps hallelujah
[1:14:59] so that i'm not wasting my life i'm
[1:15:02] living for eternal life and an eternal
[1:15:04] purpose
[1:15:05] and everywhere he leads me safe
[1:15:07] everything he tells me is true
[1:15:10] everything he gives me no one can ever
[1:15:12] take from me

[1:15:18] you have forever all your life
[1:15:20] lived for him here will be a life of
[1:15:24] unending reward there
[1:15:27] ceaseless ages of perfect
[1:15:32] joy perfect peace
[1:15:35] complete satisfaction
[1:15:39] in everything can you imagine that kind
[1:15:41] of a life
[1:15:42] where you literally have a complete
[1:15:45] satisfaction
[1:15:47] in everything
[1:15:51] yeah but you know what's the catch
[1:15:53] there's always a catch
[1:15:54] not in this one there's no catch
[1:15:57] oh that's too good to be true yeah i
[1:15:59] kind of accept it is
[1:16:01] no you tell me what it's going to cost
[1:16:03] me it's going to it's
[1:16:04] you know what it's gonna cost you your
[1:16:05] heart that god just says
[1:16:08] if you'll just give me your heart i'll
[1:16:10] take it from there
[1:16:11] i'll i'll mold you into a new creation
[1:16:13] i'll change your desires i'll make you
[1:16:15] love holiness and righteousness
[1:16:17] and you'll live forever in a beautiful
[1:16:19] world and you won't be
[1:16:20] following the lie there is
[1:16:24] no catch next slide i gotta hurry
[1:16:29] brother branham here and i know my
[1:16:31] redeemer liveth watch what makes it dark
[1:16:35] before day now you agree we're in a
[1:16:36] darkened age
[1:16:38] it's the darkest before day we are told
[1:16:41] by scientists
[1:16:42] that it's the it's the light pressing
[1:16:44] coming on moving down the sun is coming
[1:16:47] up around the world
[1:16:48] it's it's light is pre pressing the
[1:16:51] darkness
[1:16:52] she is so so he says um
[1:16:56] she is making her last strike
[1:17:00] she can't stand no more darkness can
[1:17:03] never stand
[1:17:03] love this quote darkness can never stand
[1:17:06] in the presence of light
[1:17:07] it cannot do it love this light is 10
[1:17:11] million
[1:17:11] times stronger than darkness i thought
[1:17:14] about that in a in a reality sense in
[1:17:17] just a very simple reality sense walk
[1:17:18] into a dark room and light a candle
[1:17:20] you'll see it dark i don't care how dark
[1:17:23] it is in that room light a candle turn
[1:17:25] on a flashlight strike a match
[1:17:27] darkness moves back because
[1:17:30] darkness has no power to stop light
[1:17:32] light cannot fail to drive darkness away
[1:17:35] it's 10 million times more powerful
[1:17:40] than stronger than darkness so light and
[1:17:43] darkness cannot dwell together and when
[1:17:45] light begins to rise
[1:17:47] darkness settles and gets dense it's
[1:17:49] pressing it together so
[1:17:50] if if i had a demonstration here we'd
[1:17:52] have the you'd have the earth
[1:17:54] and you have the sun and then you have
[1:17:56] you have you know you have the moon and
[1:17:57] the sun
[1:17:58] comes up over the earth and reflects and
[1:18:00] that's why sometimes you look at the
[1:18:02] moon
[1:18:02] and it's a quarter moon or a half moon
[1:18:04] or if it clears the earth then you see a
[1:18:06] full moon because it's getting the full
[1:18:07] reflection
[1:18:08] and then that reflection is bouncing
[1:18:09] back to the earth
[1:18:11] so as the light comes up over the
[1:18:14] horizon
[1:18:15] the darkness that is ahead of it over
[1:18:17] the horizon
[1:18:19] begins to be pushed back pushed back and
[1:18:21] it gets thick and gets condensed
[1:18:23] so when the when the opening of the
[1:18:25] seals came
[1:18:26] and god brought a message of light arise
[1:18:30] shine thy light has come
[1:18:33] you understand say why is the world so
[1:18:36] dark that's why
[1:18:38] so what does it mean to me does it mean
[1:18:40] does does it mean to say
[1:18:42] oh here's a here's a much better
[1:18:43] understanding of the word i think i'll
[1:18:45] believe the message nonsense
[1:18:46] that's not even why it came you don't
[1:18:48] even have to understand all the teaching
[1:18:50] of the message
[1:18:50] you got to understand the messages and
[1:18:52] books and tapes and quotes it's a person
[1:18:54] it's christ you can listen to tapes all
[1:18:57] day long but if you don't know the
[1:18:59] author
[1:19:00] if you don't know the spirit that lived
[1:19:02] in that prophet
[1:19:03] there's lots of people got the doctrines
[1:19:05] of william branham not a lot god the
[1:19:07] spirit of william branham
[1:19:08] who loved the lord with all of his heart
[1:19:11] and strived to
[1:19:12] be pleasing to god who had a spirit of
[1:19:15] love and compassion for
[1:19:17] his fellow man
[1:19:20] next slide here in shalom
[1:19:24] what does it mean god has
[1:19:27] begun to separate the light from the
[1:19:29] darkness see
[1:19:30] pressing it behind like he did in the
[1:19:32] beginning to show the dawn of a new day
[1:19:34] of a new day the church ages are fading
[1:19:36] out the church ages are fading out he
[1:19:38] repeats it
[1:19:39] god is pressing the darkness into a
[1:19:42] place it has to do it
[1:19:43] to fade out the church organizations
[1:19:46] fade out the world next slide
[1:19:51] the world is covering the thing over
[1:19:54] and worldlyism has took the whole thing
[1:19:58] then isn't god right he asked a question
[1:20:01] by worldly things and worldly dressing
[1:20:05] and worldly acting and worldly living
[1:20:09] are you uncomfortable
[1:20:12] not making you feel awkward am i are we
[1:20:16] christians
[1:20:18] by worldly things what is this doing
[1:20:21] making the darkness darker
[1:20:24] worldly acting worldly living it's
[1:20:27] the world you know people say
[1:20:32] don't judge me
[1:20:37] yeah you know what i i you remember

[1:23:53] start reading quotes like brother
[1:23:55] branham talks about here
[1:23:56] the world is covering the thing over and
[1:23:58] worldlyism has took the whole thing
[1:24:00] then isn't god right by worldly things
[1:24:01] and worldly dressing and worldly acting
[1:24:03] and worldly living

[1:24:19] those skin-tight clothes that hang on
[1:24:22] every curve of your body
[1:24:23] and parts of your body naked that only
[1:24:25] your husband should see
[1:24:28] christian men don't corrals and hang out
[1:24:31] in the world
[1:24:32] and and have that kind of a carnal
[1:24:34] lifestyle
[1:24:36] young people who are full of the holy
[1:24:37] ghost their world isn't isn't this world
[1:24:40] their world is this world
[1:24:42] so i'm sorry you say don't judge me well
[1:24:45] you told me you were
[1:24:46] christian i'm gonna expect to see a
[1:24:49] christian say
[1:24:50] we've got a holy ghost field church then
[1:24:51] you know what i'm gonna expect
[1:24:53] i'm gonna expect to hear i'm gonna
[1:24:54] expect to hear the preaching of the word
[1:24:56] i'm gonna expect to hear people
[1:24:58] pull on the word i'm going to expect the
[1:24:59] holy ghost in power say we got the holy
[1:25:01] ghost then i'm going to expect demons to
[1:25:03] be cast out and sicknesses to be driven
[1:25:05] out
[1:25:06] and people to be overcomers
[1:25:09] because you say you're a christian you
[1:25:11] say you have the truth
[1:25:12] you say we're a church then let's see a
[1:25:16] church
[1:25:17] let's see the original church let's see
[1:25:20] god and demonstration
[1:25:21] in the people's lives oh my otherwise
[1:25:25] friends why are you
[1:25:26] and coming to this church ain't going to
[1:25:28] insulate you why do you come if you're
[1:25:30] not going to be a christian why do we
[1:25:31] gather why do we have a building
[1:25:32] why do we pay the power bill why do we
[1:25:34] pay this and pay that and have men
[1:25:36] who labor what's the point if we're just
[1:25:39] going to be a social
[1:25:40] club i'm not interested in that kind of
[1:25:42] thing i want to see a church with the
[1:25:44] power
[1:25:44] and the demonstration of the holy spirit
[1:25:47] i want to know that when
[1:25:48] god speaks demons scream and faint as
[1:25:51] brother bradham said they would how'd
[1:25:54] you like to make a demon howl and faint
[1:25:59] see so we say it's a church we say we
[1:26:03] have the truth
[1:26:06] a lot of times a lot of fancy preaching
[1:26:08] and great mysteries but
[1:26:10] where's the living reality of the word
[1:26:12] made flesh in the people
[1:26:13] i'm talking today on the anointed
[1:26:16] kingdom
[1:26:17] the kingdom of christ that ought to be
[1:26:19] alive
[1:26:21] among us so i'm sorry but the holy ghost
[1:26:25] don't produce women who dress sexy and
[1:26:27] expose themselves
[1:26:29] the holy ghost don't produce men who run
[1:26:31] along in the carnalities of the world
[1:26:33] i'm looking to see men and women who are
[1:26:35] like christ
[1:26:36] i'm looking to see young people on fire
[1:26:39] full of the zeal of the holy spirit
[1:26:45] amen
[1:26:48] and hey i'm not talking about working
[1:26:51] something up
[1:26:53] i don't care that much about a workup
[1:26:56] there's plenty of places for i mean
[1:26:58] there's plenty of places where
[1:26:59] workup is fine you want to go to a pep
[1:27:01] rally you're there for a reason to get
[1:27:03] pepped
[1:27:04] it's a rally we're gonna we're gonna get
[1:27:06] our team spirit up so so we can rah-rah
[1:27:08] for our team
[1:27:09] there's a value in that the team
[1:27:10] although on the field appreciates the
[1:27:12] fans
[1:27:12] they appreciate the people screaming for
[1:27:14] them go you can do it
[1:27:16] it builds courage in you they they go to
[1:27:19] when they go to war they have singers
[1:27:21] and people who play what does it do
[1:27:23] brother branham said it puts courage
[1:27:25] you know there's something about it man
[1:27:27] that music starts going
[1:27:28] and i i'm not talking about pentecostal
[1:27:30] nonsense in this day and hour but i'm
[1:27:32] talking about a real
[1:27:34] a real feeling of worship and in the
[1:27:36] spirit of god
[1:27:37] and i'm here to tell you he's worth you
[1:27:39] lifting your voices too
[1:27:41] he's worth you lifting your hands to
[1:27:43] he's worth saying amen to
[1:27:46] he's worth your allegiance he's the king
[1:27:48] of the whole universe
[1:27:52] he only comes to do good
[1:27:55] so i'm not talking about you know
[1:27:59] i love an enthusiasm for christ in a
[1:28:02] pulling on the word
[1:28:03] you know but but i'm not talking about
[1:28:05] enthusiasm for the sake of enthusiasm
[1:28:08] i'm not talking about i mean they ha but
[1:28:10] but at the same time
[1:28:12] i see an enthusiasm at ball games
[1:28:15] i'm not condemning it i see it brother
[1:28:18] brahm said you got to get into the
[1:28:19] spirit of it
[1:28:20] and brother branham starts talking about
[1:28:22] man he said if you're a real baseball
[1:28:24] fiend
[1:28:25] and your favorite player comes up to the
[1:28:26] plate and he cracks one deep
[1:28:28] over the center field wall he said man
[1:28:30] you'll throw your popcorn up in the air
[1:28:32] you'll grab your hat and smack your
[1:28:33] friend beside you
[1:28:34] and you'll scream and holler and jump up
[1:28:36] and down and you're not that man's not

[1:28:41] money he won't even give you a selfie
[1:28:43] with him

[1:34:57] i don't care i will not surrender
[1:35:00] any of my inheritance without a fight it
[1:35:03] astonishes me
[1:35:04] how many people i see surrender
[1:35:06] god-given inheritance and god-given
[1:35:08] grounds
[1:35:09] and their and the power of god that
[1:35:11] they're entitled to is missing out of
[1:35:12] their lives
[1:35:15] and and they need it they come up on
[1:35:17] situations and they need it
[1:35:19] they need the blessing of god in their
[1:35:21] finances but they never
[1:35:23] tithe in at all never give god his tithe
[1:35:26] they keep god's portion
[1:35:28] and live as thieves and and even though
[1:35:31] he gives them everything they never give
[1:35:32] it
[1:35:32] any any part of it back and then they
[1:35:35] need god in a financial crisis
[1:35:37] i i've seen i've seen people who just
[1:35:40] their their mind was so full of
[1:35:41] hollywood
[1:35:42] that that somebody loved one gets sick
[1:35:44] they prayer faith what's that
[1:35:48] so i've seen people and i'm talking
[1:35:49] about godly
[1:35:51] christian believers who live
[1:35:54] and they've allowed the devil to occupy
[1:35:56] so much territory
[1:35:58] that they don't have any authority any
[1:36:00] enthusiasm any victory
[1:36:01] any peace there are marriages get
[1:36:04] struggled
[1:36:05] young people get struggled they don't
[1:36:06] know where the power of god is where's
[1:36:08] the healing where's the deliverance
[1:36:09] where's the authority
[1:36:10] it's all around you it's all around you
[1:36:14] you're a son of god
[1:36:15] so so what what's what's happened to you
[1:36:18] my brother
[1:36:18] or my sister come on let's ask ourselves
[1:36:21] this legitimately
[1:36:23] i've had to ask myself that lord sure
[1:36:26] i see power i see authority but hey
[1:36:29] maybe i've got some territory
[1:36:30] that the devil is occupying and it's
[1:36:32] supposed to be mine
[1:36:34] but because of my lack of zeal i won't
[1:36:36] go claim it i'm here to tell you today
[1:36:38] i'm coming to claim all that's mine i'm
[1:36:40] coming to claim i'm laying a claim and
[1:36:42] saying i will not give up the devil
[1:36:44] i will not give up my land if my family
[1:36:47] gets sick i'm going to prepare faith
[1:36:49] if i've got a financial need i'm gonna
[1:36:51] pray to
[1:36:52] for the blessing of joseph if i've gotta
[1:36:54] if i'm bound in some kind of a thing
[1:36:56] i'm gonna go to the deliverer who said
[1:36:58] he looses the prisoners
[1:37:00] and he opens the prison doors
[1:37:05] hallelujah if my children need the power
[1:37:08] of prayer and a token laid over their
[1:37:10] life
[1:37:10] when i pray for my kids my grandkids i
[1:37:13] tell you something friends i pray
[1:37:15] effectually
[1:37:17] i pray because i believe god will answer
[1:37:19] my prayer
[1:37:20] how many have that kind of confidence
[1:37:22] why because i long ago rejected the liar
[1:37:25] and i accepted the person of truth
[1:37:31] yeah i may lose battles
[1:37:36] even driven off my land but i will not
[1:37:38] concede
[1:37:40] god given land to the devil
[1:37:44] i will take back my rightful inheritance
[1:37:49] every time all the time
[1:37:52] i have one purpose to nullify the
[1:37:55] victories of the devil
[1:37:57] every day in my life
[1:38:01] his mercies are new every morning
[1:38:04] i have decided that i want to be part of
[1:38:06] an anointed
[1:38:07] kingdom how many
[1:38:10] how many you want to be part of an
[1:38:13] anointed kingdom
[1:38:14] you don't you don't how many yeah okay
[1:38:17] good 100 that's good
[1:38:21] god gets to see that but now remember he
[1:38:24] takes you at your word
[1:38:26] he takes you at your word see come
[1:38:29] brother anthony bring your team
[1:38:31] amen let's stand back to our feet
[1:38:34] ah it's so much more i wanted to say but
[1:38:37] i'm just not going to go because it's
[1:38:38] i can see that we're going to oversponge
[1:38:41] you and
[1:38:42] you'll you'll lose some of the the main
[1:38:45] parts that i want
[1:38:46] you to to get to get down deep
[1:38:57] you know whatever's you're choosing
[1:38:59] brother tony
[1:39:01] i want to ask you a couple questions
[1:39:04] we're getting ready to sing
[1:39:10] what does the word mean to you what what
[1:39:13] has it
[1:39:13] meant to you that's a better question
[1:39:17] because preaching casts out devils and
[1:39:20] drives back spirits of unbelief so right
[1:39:22] now you might have a really open mind
[1:39:23] and an open heart to say
[1:39:25] i love the word but
[1:39:28] that might be the preaching doing that
[1:39:31] so
[1:39:32] go back now go back a little bit when
[1:39:36] you weren't here under the preaching
[1:39:38] and and consider where you where you've
[1:39:41] lived
[1:39:42] where you've been living and and how
[1:39:44] much of the enemy
[1:39:45] is holding of your god-given territory
[1:39:49] and and from that vantage point
[1:39:51] everybody got that in your mind
[1:39:52] you see that in your mind's eye now ask
[1:39:55] yourself
[1:39:56] what has the word meant to me
[1:39:58] [Music]
[1:40:03] what do you you young people
[1:40:06] what do you want your life to be
[1:40:12] you got to make a choice you know one of
[1:40:15] the things that's been kind of amusing
[1:40:16] to me
[1:40:17] and i've kind of you know had little
[1:40:20] private giggles with the parents
[1:40:23] as as the as my grandkids are are going
[1:40:26] from
[1:40:27] they're not they're finding out they're
[1:40:28] not little kids anymore and they're
[1:40:29] having to face some responsibilities
[1:40:32] and you know they're they're just are
[1:40:34] not all of them but the
[1:40:36] the upper two or three have begun to
[1:40:38] realize and begun to taste
[1:40:40] a little bit of life and go wow wish i
[1:40:43] was 10 years old playing with my toys
[1:40:44] again
[1:40:47] [Music]
[1:40:48] what do you want your life to be
[1:40:52] you know i'm here to tell you that that
[1:40:54] the beauty of me
[1:40:55] asking that question is i have a
[1:40:58] wonderful answer if you want it
[1:41:00] you want it your life can be
[1:41:06] and even if it hasn't been it still can
[1:41:08] be
[1:41:09] everything that god has ordained for you
[1:41:12] to be
[1:41:13] and have in his word god saw you god saw
[1:41:16] a vision of you
[1:41:18] before the foundation of the world
[1:41:21] [Music]
[1:41:23] before the foundation of the world you
[1:41:25] know what my prayer is oftentimes
[1:41:28] [Music]

[1:42:14] my own family

[1:42:18] than i could ever do
[1:42:20] and that's why i've spent my lifetime
[1:42:22] teaching my family
[1:42:23] about jesus because i know what he can
[1:42:26] do for them
[1:42:28] how many want to be the family of god
[1:42:32] and say lord i want every every
[1:42:36] inheritance every position

[1:48:07] challenge them lord
[1:48:09] to challenge them to somehow reach down
[1:48:12] and open the
[1:48:13] eyes of their understanding that they
[1:48:15] might see greater heights
[1:48:16] that they're entitled to fly in greater
[1:48:20] lord possession of the love of god
