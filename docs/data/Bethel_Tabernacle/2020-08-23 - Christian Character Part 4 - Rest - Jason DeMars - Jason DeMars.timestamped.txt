[0:00] now he's the general manager of the
[0:03] what used to be known as the washington
[0:04] redskins
[0:06] and uh years ago he made this statement
[0:08] that if you have anxiety
[0:10] just bring your anxiety to christ and
[0:13] he'll take care of that
[0:14] now he's in a position of power and he's
[0:17] distancing himself he says
[0:18] no absolutely people need professional
[0:21] help and
[0:22] take care hey what are you ashamed of
[0:24] the gospel of christ you don't think
[0:25] anxiety
[0:26] christ can take care and solve your
[0:28] problem anxiety
[0:30] it has to be dealt with in psychological
[0:32] don't think that way
[0:33] think another way that's not what christ
[0:36] does
[0:37] christ looks to your heart and says i
[0:39] see you're troubled i see
[0:41] you're weary come to me lay your burdens
[0:44] at my feet
[0:45] and i'll bring healing that's true
[0:48] transformation that's
[0:49] that comes from the spirit of god in the
[0:51] heart doesn't mean we don't have
[0:53] troubles
[0:54] when we put our trust in christ it means
[0:56] troubles increase and our need to trust
[0:58] him
[0:59] continually increases
[1:07] you know it's a it is a quiet
[1:10] submission to the will of god quietness
[1:14] and confidence quietly waiting on him
[1:18] for the issue of events you know
[1:21] the picture is stay in your house stay
[1:24] in your own house don't hurry
[1:26] around in a two-month running this way
[1:29] running that way protecting
[1:31] just stop just rest
[1:34] god is in control god is on the throne
[1:37] god is the king
[1:39] he he sees it all he knows it all
[1:42] you can just be at rest
[1:45] that he will take care of you he's
[1:47] promised it
[1:50] jeremiah 6 verse 16.
[1:56] thus saith the lord stand you in the
[1:58] ways and see
[1:59] and ask for the old paths where is the
[2:02] good way
[2:03] and walk therein and you shall find rest
[2:06] for your souls
[2:08] but they said we will not walk therein
[2:11] he says look look look to the old ways
[2:15] don't try to find the modern way the
[2:16] modern prescriptions the new ways
[2:19] look back to god's word come back to the
[2:23] original truth of god's word
[2:26] walk in the original reality of christ
[2:29] the word
[2:30] manifested and displayed before you
[2:33] come back to that that's where you'll
[2:35] find rest for your soul
[2:39] you're not going to find rest in your
[2:41] outward situation
[2:43] there's all in this world you'll have
[2:45] troubles jesus said that
[2:47] but be of good cheer i've overcome the
[2:49] world you know it's not that place where
[2:52] we
[2:52] figure out okay i reach this
[2:55] achievement on the outside to have rest
[2:59] i mean think about the man that built up
[3:02] his barns and
[3:03] built up his farm and he filled his
[3:05] barns up and he says
[3:07] now i say oh soul be at rest
[3:10] and god immediately says you fool
[3:15] you fool why what is he looking for he
[3:18] was looking for
[3:19] rest merely on a fleshly
[3:22] temporary level that's foolish
[3:27] god is not looking for that in our lives
[3:29] well as soon as my savings account is at
[3:31] this place and my retirement as a count
[3:33] is this way
[3:34] i'm i'm going to be at rest
[3:38] i'm sorry that's not god's program i'm
[3:40] not saying
[3:41] saving money isn't it clearly is i'm not
[3:44] saying investing for the future isn't
[3:46] it clearly is god's program but it's not
[3:49] where we put our confidence
[3:51] it's not where we find our quietness
[3:53] it's in returning
[3:55] that we find rest return to your home
[3:57] where is your home it's in christ
[4:00] it's not in minnesota or delaware or
[4:04] new mexico or philadelphia
[4:08] pennsylvania your your arrest
[4:12] your home is in christ that's the place
[4:16] that you'll find
[4:17] peace
[4:22] uh obvious scripture when we're talking
[4:23] about rest is matthew 11.
[4:25] brother joe if you want to pull that up
[4:27] matthew 11 verse 25
[4:30] through 30.
[4:37] at that time jesus answered and said i
[4:41] thank thee o father
[4:43] lord of heaven and earth because thou
[4:45] hast hid these things
[4:47] from the wise and prudent and has
[4:50] revealed them
[4:51] unto babes so often we take
[4:54] take these verses and we we separate
[4:56] them out and we
[4:57] isolate them but i want to take this as
[4:59] a whole
[5:01] god is revealing himself
[5:05] to babes to those who are humble
[5:08] 26 even so father for so it seemed
[5:12] good in thy sight it's god's good
[5:14] pleasure to reveal
[5:15] himself to those who are humble
[5:19] to those who don't have a high viewpoint
[5:21] of themselves and their
[5:22] greatness and power and glory and
[5:24] position
[5:26] all things verse 27 all things are
[5:28] delivered unto me of my father
[5:31] and no man knows the son but the father
[5:34] neither knoweth
[5:34] any man the father saved the son and he
[5:37] to
[5:38] whomsoever the son will reveal him the
[5:41] father being the invisible
[5:43] spirit god and the son being the man
[5:47] christ jesus the visible manifestation
[5:50] of the invisible god
[5:52] no one knows the father except the son
[5:56] and the only ones that have a
[5:58] relationship or
[5:59] with god are the ones that the son
[6:02] reveals that invisible god
[6:04] to them notice what he says next this is
[6:07] in another topic verse 28
[6:10] come unto me all ye that labor
[6:13] and are heavy laden and i will give you
[6:16] rest where are we gonna how are we gonna
[6:19] come to him
[6:20] he's going to reveal he's going to come
[6:21] to us and reveal him
[6:24] self to us in that revelation
[6:28] now come to me where do we find rest
[6:31] in that revelation of jesus christ
[6:34] come all you that labor and are heavy
[6:37] laden you're
[6:38] you're you're working you're trying to
[6:40] achieve god's
[6:42] pleasure by work by works of your own
[6:46] by what you do on the outward and christ
[6:49] is saying
[6:49] that's not where you find salvation
[6:52] that's not where you find peace
[6:54] come to me come
[6:57] come i will reveal the father to you
[7:00] i will show the secret things
[7:03] of god to you and in that revelation
[7:08] you'll find rest and then verse 29 he
[7:12] says take
[7:13] my yoke upon you a close
[7:17] fellowship a close friendship a close
[7:20] relationship right there it's the
[7:22] picture is of
[7:24] two oxen tied together
[7:27] on a yoke and he says come here i'm
[7:29] going to show you
[7:31] this is how you work you're going to
[7:34] work
[7:35] in out of your fellowship and connection
[7:38] to me you're not going to work on your
[7:40] own
[7:41] your work it's toilsome it's weary and
[7:44] it's
[7:44] it's in vain but come and yoke together
[7:48] and work
[7:49] with me and ultimately we understand
[7:51] it's christ working
[7:53] it's not us working take my yoke upon
[7:57] you and
[7:57] learn of me for i am meek and lowly in
[8:01] heart
[8:02] and you shall find rest unto your souls
[8:04] this
[8:05] world and its religions are taskmasters
[8:10] and i don't care if it's you're talk i'm
[8:12] not talking about
[8:15] outside of the message i'm saying the
[8:17] world's religions and there's many
[8:20] preachers and people that are putting a
[8:22] yoke on people that's heavy
[8:25] and burdensome they're not showing them
[8:27] the reality of christ
[8:28] they're showing them the reality of a
[8:31] works-based system
[8:33] if you look like this and dress like
[8:35] this and act like this you're
[8:37] right with god people can do that and
[8:40] their heart can be so far from him no
[8:43] it's come and be yoked together with
[8:45] christ and you'll
[8:46] then you'll find rest because it's in
[8:48] that revelation of himself
[8:50] that you find rest and we come and he
[8:54] discloses himself to us he's not a gr
[8:56] he's not a great mystery far
[8:57] off he's right there we're walking with
[9:01] him
[9:03] we're his we're his we're his bride
[9:07] walking together with him and in we
[9:10] learn from him he shows himself that
[9:12] he's meek
[9:13] and lowly in heart and he'll find rest
[9:16] to your souls you know paul says i'm the
[9:19] prisoner of jesus christ
[9:22] and we hear that word and we think oh
[9:24] that's that's difficult that's hard
[9:26] that's harsh
[9:28] but the reality is who would you rather
[9:30] be a prisoner of
[9:32] than the one that came and said i lay
[9:34] down my life for my friends
[9:38] i give myself away completely that's not
[9:42] a hard thing to do to be a prisoner of a
[9:44] man that would do that for
[9:45] for for his friends
[9:49] he he says you'll find rest
[9:53] for your souls that's what i want we
[9:56] live in a world that
[9:57] is combating rest social media is
[10:00] combating rest
[10:01] you go on there and you say oh this
[10:03] person's on a trip oh this person's
[10:05] doing this fun thing oh this person's
[10:07] uh doing this and you say oh my life is
[10:10] terrible
[10:13] though those that that's designed by the
[10:15] devil to take
[10:16] and steal your rest
[10:20] what are you looking at what are you
[10:23] feeding on what are you feasting on
[10:25] if you're feasting on that you're not
[10:28] going to have rest but if you're
[10:29] feasting on
[10:30] and are yoked with christ you'll find
[10:33] rest for your soul
[10:35] for verse 30 for my yoke is easy
[10:38] and my burden is light
[10:41] now that can be misunderstood because we
[10:44] understand that
[10:45] all that live godly in christ jesus
[10:47] shall suffer persecution that was our
[10:48] first two
[10:50] topics in this series we all
[10:54] we all have trials and difficulties that
[10:57] god has
[10:58] laid out for us to walk in
[11:01] but we find that if we try to carry it
[11:03] on our own it's not easy
[11:06] but when we find when we find when we
[11:07] try to carry it
[11:09] in tandem yoked with jesus christ it
[11:12] becomes
[11:13] a whole lot easier it comes a whole lot
[11:16] more more
[11:17] tolerable we find rest
[11:21] in the sermon shalom brother banham says
[11:23] when we see darkness settling darkness
[11:25] just before day
[11:26] we know that the morning stars hanging
[11:28] yonder to introduce the coming sun
[11:31] that's when the morning star shines it's
[11:33] in the going between
[11:35] it's always darkest just before a few
[11:37] minutes before day the blackout comes
[11:39] the moon fails to shine the darkest
[11:41] before day is the
[11:42] light because the light is pressing the
[11:43] darkness but the morning
[11:45] star comes out and says good morning
[11:47] shalom
[11:49] that's him among us did you hear that
[11:54] what is your good morning what is your
[11:56] shalom
[11:58] it's him among us he's come
[12:01] he's come down in this day
[12:04] to reveal himself what is it shalom
[12:08] it's peace it's rest
[12:12] his word being identified shalom the
[12:14] great day is fixing to break when the
[12:16] morning breaks eternal bright and fair
[12:18] when his chosen one shall gather to
[12:20] their home beyond the sky when the role
[12:21] is con
[12:22] yonder i'll be there our names are on
[12:24] his book we'll be there
[12:26] shalom good morning peace be unto you
[12:29] the darkness is separating itself from
[12:31] the light isn't that the truth
[12:34] what an hour we're living in god's
[12:36] causing it the light's doing it
[12:39] see the lights pressing itself in such a
[12:41] way until the darkness
[12:43] has to congregate together in an hour
[12:47] of darkness in an hour where there's no
[12:50] rest
[12:51] for the human mind god is saying
[12:54] i'm i'm here i've come down
[12:59] shalom peace good morning i'm i'm here
[13:02] for you
[13:03] that you would have peace what's
[13:05] preventing your peace what's preventing
[13:08] your rest you have to enter into it
[13:13] hebrews 3.
[13:17] we'll start at verse 7 we're going to go
[13:19] through
[13:22] as many scriptures as we possibly can
[13:23] here trying to speed up a little bit
[13:26] wherefore as the holy ghost saith today
[13:28] if you will hear his voice
[13:30] i want you to notice that that's what we
[13:32] that's where we start
[13:34] hear his voice today if you hear
[13:37] his voice that's the starting place have
[13:41] you heard his voice
[13:42] has he called you have you heard him
[13:44] speak
[13:46] verse 8 harden not your hearts as in the
[13:48] provocation in the day of temptation in
[13:51] the wilderness when your fathers tempted
[13:53] me
[13:54] proved me and saw my works forty years
[13:56] wherefore i was grieved with that
[13:58] generation and said they do always
[14:00] err in their heart and they have not
[14:02] known my ways
[14:04] verse 11 so i swear in my wrath they
[14:07] shall not
[14:08] enter into my rest
[14:12] rest speaks of abode dwelling place
[14:16] reposing down
[14:20] they're not going to enter into my
[14:21] presence which brings them rest
[14:24] why were they not going to enter into
[14:26] that
[14:29] their hearts were hard they didn't hear
[14:31] they heard the voice of god
[14:33] but they responded with unbelief
[14:37] verse 12 take heed brethren lest there
[14:39] be any of you
[14:40] an evil heart of unbelief in departing
[14:44] from the living god
[14:46] but exhort one another daily we need
[14:49] each other
[14:50] we need one another daily it doesn't say
[14:53] exhort one another twice a week on
[14:55] wednesday and sunday night
[14:57] you know it says daily
[15:00] we need we need that why because the
[15:02] world is lying to us
[15:04] every day while it is called today
[15:07] exhort one another daily while it is
[15:09] called
[15:10] today lest any of you be hardened
[15:12] through the deceitfulness of sin
[15:15] we're bombarded with the deceitfulness
[15:17] of sin
[15:18] every direction every day we're being
[15:22] lied to
[15:23] every day by the media by the things
[15:26] that we see
[15:27] in public by people around us um at our
[15:30] work and
[15:30] and the places that we go we're being
[15:33] lied to
[15:34] so we need each other what for what
[15:37] to speak the truth into one another's
[15:40] life that's not just for the pastor or
[15:42] the preacher to do
[15:43] that's for every believer exhort one
[15:46] another it doesn't say
[15:48] preach or exhort the people well it
[15:50] doesn't say that to timothy
[15:52] but this is not talking about that this
[15:53] is talking about you
[15:56] you need to exhort other people and
[15:58] other people need to exhort you
[16:00] exhort means encourage conv convict
[16:04] speak the word over people when once a
[16:08] week no
[16:08] daily well it is called today
[16:13] lest any of you be hardened through the
[16:14] deceitfulness of sin
[16:16] in other words you need exhortation
[16:19] daily or you're going to be
[16:21] hardened through the deceitfulness of
[16:23] sin
[16:24] so get exhort somebody
[16:27] and pray that somebody would exhort you
[16:31] that's we need each other verse 14
[16:34] for we are made partakers of christ if
[16:37] we hold the beginning of our confidence
[16:40] steadfast to the end
[16:43] while it is today said today if you will
[16:45] hear his voice harden on your hearts as
[16:47] in the provocation
[16:49] for some when they had heard did provoke
[16:51] how be it not all came out
[16:54] not all that came out by moses but with
[16:57] whom was he grieved 40 years was it not
[16:59] with them that
[17:00] sinned whose carcasses fell in the
[17:03] wilderness and to whom
[17:04] swear that he that they should not enter
[17:07] into his rest but to them
[17:08] that believe not so we see that they
[17:11] could not enter
[17:12] in because of unbelief
[17:16] so rest was offered right
[17:20] true rest in almighty god not just the
[17:23] sabbath day
[17:25] but genuine spiritual rest for the soul
[17:29] was offered to them they couldn't enter
[17:31] in
[17:32] why because based on their circumstances
[17:36] based on what they saw around them in
[17:38] the wilderness
[17:39] they said i don't believe god i don't
[17:41] believe his promises i don't believe
[17:43] what's happening i can't accept god's
[17:47] word because
[17:48] my circumstances are not reflective of
[17:50] what he's telling me
[17:54] so how do we enter into rest the
[17:57] opposite of unbelief
[17:59] faith trust
[18:05] uh four let's see yeah four verse one
[18:09] let us therefore fear lest a promise
[18:12] being left of
[18:13] us of entering into his rest
[18:17] any of you should seem to come short of
[18:20] it so we should have a godly
[18:22] reverence because we know that through
[18:24] unbelief
[18:25] based upon our circumstances we can
[18:29] put our soul in a state of tumult now
[18:32] that doesn't mean
[18:33] we lose our salvation in in
[18:36] in the christian sense of understanding
[18:38] that if you're born again
[18:39] but there's a condition of the soul that
[18:41] produces rest
[18:43] and there's a condition of the soul that
[18:45] produces
[18:46] tumult
[18:51] verse 2 for unto us was the gospel
[18:53] preached as well as unto them
[18:55] but the word preached did not profit
[18:57] them
[18:58] the promise was there the promise was in
[19:01] effect
[19:02] but it was no it was unprofitable to
[19:05] them
[19:05] not being mixed with faith in them that
[19:08] heard it
[19:10] for we which have believed do enter into
[19:12] rest as he said if you believe
[19:14] faith produces rest genuine faith
[19:18] given by god leads to rest
[19:22] if you don't have rest what are you
[19:24] abiding in
[19:27] as he said as i have sworn in my wrath
[19:29] if they shall enter into my rest
[19:30] although the works were finished
[19:32] from the foundation of the world for he
[19:35] spake in a certain place of the seventh
[19:37] day on this wise and god did
[19:39] rest the seventh day from his works and
[19:41] in this place again if they shall enter
[19:42] into my rest
[19:44] seeing therefore it remaineth that some
[19:46] must enter therein and they to whom it
[19:47] is first preached entered not in because
[19:49] of unbelief
[19:51] again he limited a certain day saying in
[19:53] david today after so long time as it is
[19:55] said
[19:56] today if you hear his voice harden not
[19:58] your hearts
[20:00] faith comes by hearing hearing by the
[20:03] word of god
[20:04] if you hear his voice personally to you
[20:06] don't harden your heart
[20:09] verse 9 i'm going to skip a little bit
[20:11] there remaineth there for a rest
[20:13] to the people of god verse 10 for he
[20:16] that had
[20:17] entered into his rest he's also ceased
[20:19] from his own works
[20:20] as god did from his you have to cease
[20:22] from your own works to enter
[20:24] into rest this is the verse that i
[20:26] wanted to get to and quickly
[20:28] quickly finish let us labor therefore to
[20:31] enter into rest lest any man fall after
[20:33] the same example
[20:34] of unbelief labor to enter into rest
[20:37] work to enter into rest what does that
[20:40] mean
[20:41] how do you labor or work to enter into
[20:44] that rest it's not
[20:45] by your own works he just said cease
[20:48] from your own works
[20:49] it's not by trying to please god through
[20:52] what you
[20:52] personally can do how do you lent how do
[20:55] you labor to enter into that right rest
[20:58] second peter 3 18 says but grow in grace
[21:01] and in the knowledge of our lord and
[21:02] savior jesus christ
[21:04] john 8 31 says if you continue in my
[21:07] word
[21:08] then are you my disciple disciples
[21:10] indeed
[21:11] we grow into rest by degree as we
[21:14] continue to believe
[21:16] and as we pray more and more and hear
[21:18] the word
[21:19] and attend services and fellowship with
[21:22] one another
[21:23] around the word if we
[21:26] take the means of grace that god has
[21:29] given
[21:30] to us we abide in those
[21:33] it takes effort for you and i
[21:36] to stay in that condition that we have
[21:38] rest in our souls
[21:41] if we just let ourselves fall into the
[21:44] natural things of life we lose rest we
[21:47] lose
[21:47] peace we don't have it we fall into the
[21:50] place of unbelief
[21:52] the bible says we're transformed by the
[21:54] renewing of our mind
[21:56] the the bible says that we're renewed
[21:59] into his
[22:00] image as we behold the spirit of the
[22:03] lord
[22:04] so we have to stay in that position of
[22:06] beholding
[22:07] we have to stay in that position of
[22:10] walking in prayer and in feeding on the
[22:12] word that is our labor
[22:15] to enter into rest he says take my yoke
[22:17] upon you
[22:19] that's that's the labor that this is
[22:21] speaking of it's not speaking of
[22:23] you plea you you please god through your
[22:25] works simply saying
[22:26] i'm staying close to christ i'm abiding
[22:30] in the word so that rest remains
[22:33] in my soul i have to finish there
[22:37] father we just come to you lord and we
[22:39] ask that you would
[22:41] just really strike our hearts with the
[22:43] revelation of
[22:44] of rest that you have for us lord
[22:49] as the bible says let us therefore
[22:52] fear unless the promise being given
[22:55] we not enter into it lord
[22:58] it's not a mortal fear like that but
[23:00] it's a great reverence that we have
[23:03] for you and for for
[23:06] for your purpose in our lives so lord we
[23:09] ask
[23:10] that your spirit would work in us in
[23:13] such a way that we would
[23:15] not be hindered from pursuing you and
[23:18] pursuing
[23:19] the rest that you've promised to those
[23:21] who abide in faith
[23:24] we commit ourselves to you lord we
[23:25] commit the service the worship the
[23:27] preaching of the word to you we ask that
[23:29] your name
[23:30] would be lifted up and glorified and
[23:32] that every
[23:33] heart would connect to you
[23:38] we commit these things to you in the
[23:39] name of jesus christ amen
