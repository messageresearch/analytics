[0:01] I want to give a quick testimony before
[0:02] I sing the song So for the past 5 years
[0:06] I have been battling on and off with
[0:08] depression and uh
[0:10] anxiety and uh one particular day I was
[0:14] having a very bad day uh came home from
[0:18] school and was just in a really really
[0:21] bad mood and
[0:23] uh I uh went downstairs to our
[0:27] basement and I was just uh blowing off
[0:30] some steam and was like God I've been
[0:33] praying for this for five years to uh
[0:36] for you to deliver me from
[0:39] this and uh then I sang this
[0:42] song and uh the word say even if you
[0:45] don't My Hope isn't you alone so I sang
[0:50] that song and
[0:53] uh halfway through the song I started
[0:57] balling because I realized um
[1:01] even if God doesn't take this away from
[1:04] me it doesn't matter cuz he's all I got
[1:09] and he's all I
[1:10] need
