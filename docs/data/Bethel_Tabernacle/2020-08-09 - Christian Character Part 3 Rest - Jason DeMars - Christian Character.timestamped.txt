[0:14] foreign
[0:25] good morning everyone may the lord bless
[0:27] you
[0:28] we're just going to start with a word of
[0:29] prayer gracious father
[0:32] we come to you in the name of jesus
[0:34] christ and we ask that your
[0:37] spirit would come and take your word and
[0:39] break it open to our hearts
[0:43] lord let it uh bring a supernatural
[0:46] effect upon our souls this morning
[0:50] lord may it may it break through
[0:54] the things of this world the the
[0:56] troubles the trials the
[0:58] the things that are afflicting us may
[1:00] break through everything and
[1:01] go to the just the very depth of our
[1:04] nature of our soul
[1:06] to bring something lord that would be of
[1:08] eternal value
[1:10] help me to step out of the way may your
[1:12] spirit come and take complete
[1:14] control of this vessel that only your
[1:17] word would flow forth from it
[1:19] we commit ourselves to you for your
[1:21] glory in jesus name
[1:22] amen we're gonna continue on the topic
[1:26] christian character uh part three it's
[1:29] been
[1:30] almost i think two months since i did it
[1:32] the
[1:33] part two so um but it's continuing on
[1:37] and we're looking
[1:38] at rest
[1:41] the christian attribute of rest
[1:44] so the first scripture i want to open up
[1:46] with is in hebrews
[1:48] chapter 4 and we're going to read 9
[1:51] through 11.
[1:55] there remaineth therefore a rest to the
[1:58] people of god
[2:00] for he that is entered into his rest his
[2:03] rest
[2:04] god's rest he also has ceased from his
[2:08] own works
[2:09] as god did from his let us
[2:12] labor therefore to enter into that rest
[2:16] lest any man fall after the same
[2:19] example of unbelief may the lord add the
[2:22] blessing to the reading
[2:23] of his word rest is a
[2:27] biblical principle we find in both the
[2:29] old testament
[2:31] and the new testament if you look at
[2:36] if you study that word if in your in
[2:38] your e-sword or whatever program that
[2:40] you use
[2:41] look up rest and you'll find out and
[2:44] look at the different strong's
[2:45] definitions
[2:46] there's so many different words that are
[2:49] used that are translated into english
[2:52] in rest and what i gather from that is
[2:54] rest is multi-faceted
[2:59] and i the reason why it seems strange
[3:01] christian
[3:02] character and then to say rest is a part
[3:05] of christian character
[3:06] but i believe it's an inward state
[3:09] of the soul that is to permeate every
[3:13] characteristic
[3:14] that we have as believers
[3:18] so rest is multifaceted in that we can
[3:21] speak about
[3:22] an inward rest
[3:26] while at the very same time there is not
[3:28] an outward
[3:29] rest to the flesh for example
[3:34] the curse upon all of us was this
[3:37] in genesis 3 17 through 19.
[3:42] and unto adam he said because thou has
[3:44] hearkened unto the voice of thy wife and
[3:46] as eaten of the tree of which i
[3:47] commanded thee saying thou shalt not eat
[3:49] of it
[3:50] curse it is the ground for thy sake in
[3:52] sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days
[3:54] of thy life
[3:55] thorns also and thistles shall it bring
[3:58] forth to thee and thou shalt eat
[4:00] the herb of the field in the sweat of
[4:02] thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou
[4:04] return unto the ground
[4:05] for out of it wast thou taken for dust
[4:07] thou art and unto dust shalt thou
[4:10] return this is god placing a curse of
[4:14] not having rest of
[4:17] labor to the body which brings
[4:21] weariness and can bring with without any
[4:24] rest at all if you're to work seven days
[4:26] a week long
[4:28] hours no rest you can bring so
[4:31] so much damage to your body
[4:35] you damage not only your body you damage
[4:37] your mind
[4:38] and you ultimately will damage your soul
[4:40] if you don't bring
[4:42] some kind of rest to this body which is
[4:45] another principle
[4:47] which is the sabbath day that god
[4:50] established under the old testament for
[4:53] the jewish people
[4:54] this is a this continues not to be
[4:58] that we have to have a sabbath day on
[5:00] friday night to
[5:02] saturday night no but it's a principle
[5:05] in god's word
[5:06] you must take time to disconnect
[5:09] to rest to leave your physical life
[5:13] in the hands of god and say i'm just
[5:15] going to do nothing
[5:16] i'm going to cease from my labor so that
[5:18] i can have a refreshing
[5:21] to my body to my mind to my soul and if
[5:24] we don't do that
[5:26] there's consequences upon us
[5:29] you know we see a very basic
[5:32] principle of this you see chick-fil-a
[5:35] they close on sundays
[5:37] they do so much more business than any
[5:39] of other these other
[5:41] companies on those other six days that
[5:44] it pales and
[5:45] their their sales are just so much
[5:48] further above
[5:49] many many many many stores that are open
[5:51] seven days a week
[5:53] why because it's god's principle of rest
[5:57] if you don't rest you'll be a sick
[6:00] person
[6:01] you'll be a weak person you won't be
[6:04] everything that god created you to be
[6:06] that's
[6:07] one fast facet of the multi multi
[6:11] multifaceted aspects of rest
[6:16] but the but david in the psalms also
[6:19] speaks about
[6:20] not having any rest because of his sin
[6:25] so there's another aspect to it that we
[6:27] can take away our soul's rest
[6:30] that was purchased for us in christ by
[6:33] abiding
[6:35] in sin by
[6:38] allowing unbelief to take root in us
[6:41] and therefore the attributes of unbelief
[6:43] begin to
[6:44] manifest in our life and because of that
[6:48] we won't have rest because if you're
[6:50] born of the spirit of god
[6:52] and you start going after a sinful
[6:56] lifestyle
[6:57] you know it's possible that you as a
[6:59] born-again person
[7:01] can backslide can come to this place
[7:04] where you say ah
[7:05] you know the the devil can get your mind
[7:07] so messed up
[7:09] to where you just start going towards
[7:12] sinful life sinful attitude sinful way
[7:15] of thinking and what happens
[7:16] what happens to your rest in christ you
[7:18] don't have any
[7:20] that's actually god's grace he says okay
[7:23] you want to go towards sin i'm taking
[7:26] away your spiritual rest
[7:29] and we then we begin to panic and say
[7:31] what's going on what's happening
[7:32] something's wrong with
[7:34] why isn't god with me it's because of
[7:36] your walking and sin
[7:38] it's because you're choosing what to let
[7:41] sin have dominion over you
[7:43] and therefore you don't have spiritual
[7:45] rest and thank the lord for that
[7:47] correction
[7:50] paul also says he found no
[7:53] rest in his spirit because he couldn't
[7:55] find titus
[7:59] now that doesn't mean that paul didn't
[8:01] have spiritual rest
[8:04] in christ it simply meant the spirit is
[8:07] connected to the mind right
[8:09] so in his mind he couldn't find that
[8:12] place of rest because his purpose
[8:14] was to locate titus and send him
[8:17] on on a missions trip but he couldn't
[8:20] find him so he had no rest
[8:22] until he found titus
[8:26] i found him now we can go forward and do
[8:29] what god wants us to do another place he
[8:31] says when he was in
[8:33] macedonia that his flesh
[8:36] had no rest because he was troubled on
[8:39] every side
[8:42] again our flesh our spirit we can get to
[8:45] that place
[8:47] there's no rest troubles on every side
[8:49] we're weak
[8:50] but that's a different rest than what
[8:54] we're talking about for our soul
[8:57] it's not the same it's not the same
[8:58] thing just because you have trouble
[9:01] on the outside and you don't have rest
[9:04] on the outside
[9:05] doesn't mean that there's not rest on
[9:08] the inside
[9:10] so that's important to understand
[9:13] but at the same time god wants that rest
[9:17] that's in your soul
[9:18] to permeate the rest of you
[9:23] completely the rest is supposed to be
[9:26] not only inside but it's supposed to be
[9:29] expressed
[9:30] on the outside
[9:34] so what is rest you know
[9:37] these two things sometimes you it's hard
[9:40] to
[9:41] quantify them because we want to look at
[9:44] external things
[9:45] to define what rest is another word that
[9:49] goes along with that is peace
[9:52] um a different topic but humility is
[9:56] like that for me as well
[9:58] it's so it for me it's hard to quantify
[10:02] it because it's an inner
[10:04] it's an inside thing and yet that should
[10:06] be expressed
[10:07] on the outside so philippians 4
[10:12] 7 says in the peace of god which passeth
[10:15] all
[10:15] understanding shall keep your hearts and
[10:18] minds
[10:19] through christ jesus so it is a peace of
[10:23] god that your spirit can't even
[10:25] comprehend
[10:26] that those five attributes of the mind
[10:30] cannot comprehend it's not an
[10:33] it's not something where you can okay
[10:35] i'm gonna go and explain why i have
[10:37] have peace in this situation it's the
[10:40] peace of god
[10:41] and it's beyond understanding why is it
[10:43] beyond understanding
[10:45] because humanly speaking there's no
[10:47] reason
[10:49] a person would have rest when they're
[10:51] troubled on every side
[10:53] humanly speaking there's no reason why a
[10:55] person would have rest when they're
[10:58] physically exhausted but yet
[11:01] there is a peace that can pass all of
[11:04] the understanding
[11:05] it bypasses all that goes directly to
[11:07] the soul
[11:08] and permeates your whole being
[11:13] really rest is almost synonymous
[11:16] with peace you know the jews have the
[11:20] greeting
[11:20] on this on their sabbath shabbat shalom
[11:24] you know it's two different words that
[11:26] almost have a very similar
[11:29] very similar connotation
[11:34] rest also speaks of tranquility
[11:38] another big word that we rarely use
[11:40] right now
[11:41] but tranquility according to webster's
[11:43] dictionary is quiet
[11:45] calm undisturbed peaceful not agitated
[11:49] the atmosphere is tranquil the state is
[11:52] tranquil
[11:53] a tranquil retirement is desirable but a
[11:55] tranquil mind
[11:57] is essential to happiness
[12:01] it's a quietness it's a calmness it's a
[12:04] state of not being agitated i think
[12:06] ultimately
[12:08] we can be in this position and place
[12:11] not because of our circumstances not
[12:13] because we work ourselves
[12:14] into the place where we indeed
[12:18] feel peace feel rest but we can rest
[12:21] because we serve a sovereign and
[12:24] faithful
[12:25] god god is in control of everything
[12:28] so that we understand our circumstances
[12:32] are ordained of the lord
[12:35] we can look at them and we can on on the
[12:37] outward side
[12:38] say this is messed up this is wrong why
[12:41] is this person done this
[12:42] why are they doing this why have i found
[12:45] myself in this situation at this point
[12:47] in time
[12:48] and then we can back up and say why are
[12:51] you grumbling
[12:53] god is in control god
[12:56] led you here god directed you here
[12:59] now you're here now you're complaining
[13:02] rest god is in control he's working
[13:06] something out in your life he's working
[13:08] out he's working out godly character in
[13:10] your life
[13:11] do you trust him if you trust him
[13:14] in this specific circumstance
[13:18] you can rest
[13:22] let's look at some of the different
[13:23] words and the way it's used in the old
[13:25] testament
[13:28] exodus 23 verse 12 says six days
[13:33] thou shalt do thy work and on the
[13:34] seventh day thou shalt rest that thine
[13:36] ox and thine ass may rest
[13:38] and the son of thy handmaid and the
[13:40] stranger may be
[13:42] refreshed so this is speaking of that
[13:45] literal day
[13:46] it's uh it's speaking of the word
[13:49] shabbat to cease desist
[13:54] rest to cause to cease to put
[13:57] into an end to desist from your stopping
[14:03] it's a day to stop but it's interesting
[14:06] that he doesn't use the same word for
[14:08] the cattle he use a different word for
[14:10] the cattle
[14:11] nuach nuach is the word and it
[14:14] but it carries a very similar meeting to
[14:16] rest to settle down to remain
[14:19] you just stop
[14:22] you cease from all labors
[14:26] and it says at the end that you may be
[14:29] refreshed
[14:31] that's what god wants he wants us to as
[14:33] a result of rest
[14:35] he wants us to be refreshed
[14:39] that's physically speaking but there's a
[14:41] spiritual
[14:42] type there as well
[14:46] um exodus 35
[14:50] verse 2 six days shall work be done
[14:54] but on the seventh day there should
[14:57] there shall be to you and holy day
[15:00] a sabbath of rest to the lord
[15:03] whosoever doeth work therein shall be
[15:05] put to death
[15:08] so did you notice there he says a
[15:10] sabbath of rest
[15:12] to the lord he uses the word
[15:16] a shabbat of shabbathan
[15:20] so it's almost like he's doubling up
[15:22] doubling up the use
[15:24] of the word right there
[15:27] but just a different different verb
[15:30] tense basically is what's being used
[15:33] and so you know this is to be a time
[15:36] that you rest if you work
[15:39] you're going to be put to death wow that
[15:42] is god being serious about
[15:45] rest it's not a joke it's it's not
[15:48] something that is a as a side issue
[15:52] god wants us to rest
[15:56] and the death penalty applies if you
[15:58] don't rest
[15:59] and so this is obviously we're not
[16:03] speaking of a literal day that's done
[16:05] away
[16:06] in christ we're not speaking of sunday
[16:09] we're speaking of something beyond that
[16:12] but it has spiritual connotations that
[16:15] if you don't
[16:16] enter into it it is spiritual death
[16:21] psalm 37 7 rest in the lord and wait
[16:25] patiently for him
[16:27] fret not thyself because of him who
[16:29] prospers in his way because of the man
[16:31] who brings wicked
[16:32] devices to pass
[16:36] this word is a little different it's not
[16:38] shabbat
[16:40] it's a mom and it means to be silent be
[16:43] still
[16:44] wait to be dumb it means shut up
[16:48] keep your mouth be still and know that i
[16:49] am god stop
[16:51] grow dumb to be silent to be still
[16:56] to be struck dumb to make quiet
[17:00] so it's speaking of
[17:04] stop just stop let god
[17:07] take care of this situation commit it to
[17:10] him
[17:11] wait for him let him take care of it
[17:14] there's a wicked person he's prospering
[17:17] he's growing he's my enemy
[17:20] he's getting better what what's this
[17:22] getting stronger the spirit of this age
[17:25] is getting stronger it's coming against
[17:27] us more and more and it's increasing
[17:30] what are we to do rest
[17:34] that's what we're for that's the very
[17:36] first thing we're to do
[17:37] rest and wait patiently on the lord he
[17:40] will bring deliverance
[17:43] psalm 38 3-5
[17:47] this is speaking on the negative side
[17:50] there is no soundness in my flesh
[17:52] because of thine anger
[17:53] neither is there any rest in my bones
[17:56] because of my
[17:56] sin for my iniquities are gone over my
[17:59] head as
[18:00] a heavy burden they are too heavy for me
[18:03] my wounds stink and are corrupt because
[18:05] of my
[18:06] foolishness it's an ugly terrible
[18:09] picture
[18:10] to be in that place in that position
[18:12] this is god's viewpoint
[18:15] of what it looks like to him when we're
[18:17] walking
[18:18] in sin a stinking wound
[18:23] that's completely corrupt we know what
[18:25] happens to
[18:27] stick people with stinking wounds
[18:30] what happens when a wound is infected
[18:33] that infection permeates the entire body
[18:37] and what happens to the body it's dead
[18:41] so don't let sin become a stinking wound
[18:45] in your flesh an infected wound
[18:48] in your body because it will permeate
[18:51] everything and it will destroy you
[18:53] no you won't be lost because you're born
[18:55] of the spirit of god
[18:56] but you can allow sin to take that
[18:59] dominion
[19:00] to seize you to where you have no
[19:03] rest into your body soul and spirit
[19:08] and it's a great danger for us as
[19:09] christians to allow us
[19:11] ourselves to be in that place
[19:14] psalm 95 7 through 11 for he is our god
[19:18] and we are the people of his pasture in
[19:19] the sheep of his hand
[19:21] today if you will hear his voice harden
[19:23] not your heart is in the provocation and
[19:25] is in the day of temptation in the
[19:26] wilderness
[19:27] when your father's tempted me proved me
[19:29] and saw my work forty years long was i
[19:32] grieved
[19:34] was i grieved with this generation and
[19:37] said it as a people that do
[19:39] air in their heart and they have not
[19:41] known my ways
[19:42] unto whom i swear in my wrath they
[19:44] should not enter
[19:45] into my rest this is the word mnucha
[19:49] it speaks of the resting place so the
[19:52] dwelling place of god
[19:54] and he's saying these people will not
[19:56] enter into the place where my presence
[19:59] abides why they refuse to hear my voice
[20:04] they refuse to believe the word that
[20:06] i've spoken
[20:07] therefore they cannot enter into that
[20:10] rest
[20:11] so we see in the old testament rest is a
[20:13] multi-faceted thing
[20:15] and it's an important theme really it
[20:17] permeates
[20:18] everything in the old testament
[20:23] they are to have rest from their enemies
[20:26] they are to rest from their labors one
[20:28] day a week there to rest
[20:30] every seven years there to have three
[20:33] feasts a year
[20:35] when they rest they're to enter into the
[20:37] rest or the dwelling place of the lord
[20:40] and there to have a shalom rest where
[20:43] they're not abiding
[20:45] in sin and i want to just finish on this
[20:49] quote from brother branham
[20:51] this is from the sermon
[20:54] the inner veil from 1956 january 21st
[20:58] says this now that is what i find around
[21:02] most christian lives most i hate to say
[21:04] it that way but it's true
[21:06] the most people that confess that can
[21:09] profess
[21:09] christianity they seem to have such a
[21:12] hard struggling time to hold on
[21:15] i believe it's because of a lack of
[21:17] correct teaching of the bible
[21:20] there's no such a thing as holding on
[21:23] he's done the holding on the whole
[21:26] christian
[21:26] principle is based upon rest
[21:31] what did he just say i'm just gonna stop
[21:34] right there
[21:36] the whole the whole
[21:39] that means all of it the entire
[21:42] christian principle that's why i'm
[21:45] talking about
[21:46] christian character and rest the whole
[21:50] christian principle is based upon
[21:53] rest come unto me
[21:56] all ye that labor and heavy laden and i
[21:59] will give you rest
[22:00] don't have to worry and struggle you're
[22:03] just resting that's all
[22:04] given rest you enter in peace that's the
[22:07] whole thing's finished
[22:09] them who he has called his justified
[22:11] them who is just justified he's all
[22:14] rest ready glorified scripture quoting
[22:18] notice it's nothing that you do or what
[22:20] you or what you can do
[22:22] it's what god has done for you in christ
[22:26] you could not come to someone said well
[22:29] i'll tell you i just quit this and when
[22:30] i went to seeking god
[22:32] no man ever sought god man don't seek
[22:36] god
[22:36] god seeks man the very beginning at the
[22:39] garden of eden
[22:40] proved it adam ought to have been
[22:41] running through the garden hollering
[22:42] father father where are you
[22:44] but it was god going through the garden
[22:46] of eden saying
[22:47] adam adam where art thou and adam was
[22:50] hiding
[22:51] that's the nature of man and jesus said
[22:54] no man can come to me except the father
[22:57] draws him first
[22:59] it's nothing you can do about it and
[23:01] jesus didn't come to the calvary to die
[23:03] for a haphazard purpose
[23:05] he didn't come there and say well maybe
[23:06] i'll die it'll be so pathetic
[23:08] to some people they'll see that i died
[23:11] and maybe they'll come and serve the
[23:12] lord
[23:13] jesus come for a specific purpose to
[23:16] redeem those
[23:17] who god by foreknowledge elected to come
[23:20] to him
[23:21] that's correct if you whose scholars
[23:23] that know the bible know that even the
[23:25] patriarchs made an example
[23:27] abraham is god's election god called
[23:30] abraham when he wasn't nothing
[23:31] nobody he's just an ordinary
[23:35] man i'm just gonna take a moment before
[23:38] we
[23:39] stop there that brother branham
[23:43] there makes such a profound incredibly
[23:46] profound statement
[23:48] the whole christian principle starts
[23:51] with rest
[23:53] and then he establishes why that is
[23:56] why is it based on rest
[23:59] because it's not what you've done it's
[24:02] not what you do
[24:03] it's not even you seeking god god has
[24:06] called you god has changed your heart
[24:09] changed your life god has given you the
[24:13] righteousness of jesus christ
[24:15] therefore you can rest because it's him
[24:19] calling you and christ specifically came
[24:22] to die for luther's sins for george's
[24:26] sins
[24:26] for jason's sins specifically for me
[24:30] not in a haphazard way my personal sins
[24:34] from the day i was the day i was
[24:36] accountable to god
[24:38] till the day that i die or am raptured
[24:40] every one of those sins was
[24:42] placed on jesus christ in the garden of
[24:44] gethsemane
[24:45] and he took them and carried them and
[24:47] god poured his wrath out
[24:49] upon jesus christ upon that body and
[24:52] my sins were expiated there at the cross
[24:55] and i
[24:56] was forgiven there and all of it's put
[25:00] in the sea of
[25:00] god's forgetfulness before i was even
[25:03] born
[25:04] and then he called me he changed me he's
[25:07] leading my life
[25:09] then i can rest
[25:12] then i can know this sovereign god
[25:15] who's already finished the work at
[25:18] calvary
[25:19] will accomplish the work that he's
[25:21] purposed to do
[25:23] that is scripture that is god's purpose
[25:26] that's the restored faith that we're
[25:28] resting on
[25:30] let's pray heavenly father we just come
[25:32] to you lord and we're so thankful
[25:34] for the light of your word
[25:37] that we can rest and that this
[25:40] rest is based upon exactly
[25:43] what brother branham taught it to be
[25:45] there because that is exactly
[25:48] the scripture that's been restored to us
[25:51] and we're thankful for that lord
[25:54] help us to enter into rest we commit
[25:57] ourselves we commit the service
[25:59] to you for your glory in the name of
[26:01] jesus christ
[26:02] amen god bless you
[26:18] you
