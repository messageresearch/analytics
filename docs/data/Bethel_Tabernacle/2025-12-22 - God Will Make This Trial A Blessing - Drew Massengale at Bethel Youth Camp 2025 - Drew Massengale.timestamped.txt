[0:04] I've just came [singing and music] into
[0:07] the valley
[0:08] like I've never been before.
[0:12] I keep searching [music] for a way out.
[0:15] Seems like [singing] padlocks are on the
[0:18] door. [music]
[0:19] Oh, there must be another sunrise,
[0:23] another sunset [music] that I'll
[0:25] [singing] see. God will make this trial
[0:29] a blessing [music] and the whole wide
[0:32] world will see. [singing] God will make
[0:37] [music] this trial a blessing. Though he
[0:40] sends me to my knees, [singing]
[0:43] though [music] my tears flow like a
[0:46] river, yet in him there's sweet relief.
[0:50] There's [singing] no need to get
[0:53] discouraged. There's no [music] need to
[0:56] talk defeat. [singing] God will make my
[0:59] child a blessing. That's the love he has
[1:04] for me. [music]
[1:08] I am not the first man to come into
[1:12] [singing]
[1:12] this place. You [music] see, every child
[1:16] of God, these tests we must face. It is
[1:21] [singing] here that God [music] will
[1:23] mold you and make you what you want to
[1:27] be. God will make your child
[1:30] [music and singing] a blessing. And the
[1:32] whole world will see. God [music] will
[1:37] [singing] make his child a blessing.
[1:40] Know it sends me to my [music] knees.
[1:44] Though my tears flow like a river, yet
[1:48] in him there's sweet relief. [music]
[1:51] There's no need to get discouraged.
[1:55] There's no need to talk [music] to me.
[1:58] God has made my trial a [singing]
[2:01] blessing. That's the love he [music] has
[2:04] for me.
[2:08] Now I'm standing [singing] on the
[2:10] mountain. Looking back, [music] I can
[2:14] see when I was in that lowest valley,
[2:18] father's [music] hand was leading me.
[2:22] Oh, it's good to see [music] the
[2:24] sunshine and to taste [singing]
[2:27] victory.
[2:29] God has made your childless
[2:32] and all [music]
[2:34] our world will see. God will
[2:37] [music and singing]
[2:38] make his triless
[2:41] though he [music and singing] me to my
[2:44] knees. Though my tears flow like a river
[2:49] yet [music] there sweet
[2:52] there's no need to get discouraged.
[2:56] I'm not going to talk defeat. [music]
[2:59] God has made this trial [singing] a
[3:02] blessing and [music] the whole wide
[3:04] world will see.
[3:08] There's no need to get discouraged.
[3:12] We're not going to talk
[3:13] [music and singing] defeat. God has made
[3:16] your child a blessing. [music]
[3:19] That's the love he has for me.
