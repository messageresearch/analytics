foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] of God this is part four Let's uh approach the Lord in prayer father we come to you Lord and we're asking that your Holy Spirit would come and be amongst us Lord take your word and break open the words of Life To Us father we want to commit this time and commit ourselves unto you Lord be glorified amongst us we ask in Jesus name amen amen brother Mark if you want to go to the next screen I'm going to grab the flicker here get that going in a second Genesis 3 14 and 15. and the Lord God said unto the serpent because thou has done this Thou Art cursed above all cattle and above every beast of the field upon thy belly shalt thou go and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life and I will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel may the Lord add the blessing to the reading of his word you can be seated we found in our Study last week and our PowerPoint vanished so we no problem so we found in our Study last week we looked at that and saw the woman has a seed and the serpent has a seed and then we ran that forward to the New Testament to look at the Fulfillment of that Jesus didn't have trouble with lizards or snakes or orangutans or monkeys or gorillas that wasn't who crucified him it was a Generation of Vipers that was spoken about but that they were people they were human beings that were of their father the devil Jesus said children children of the devil and and he go we we looked at that in John 8. and we'll talk we'll review that in just a second um we also looked in second Corinthians 11. I'm not going to read it again but we saw that the church was engaged as a virgin to Christ and Paul likened that unto Eve being engaged as a virgin to Adam and then Paul's concern or his fear was that the church would commit adultery by accepting a false word then he then he relates that back to the original sin so if Paul fears the church committing adultery and it Compares it to Eve's sin that we can conclude by the scripture that Eve committed adultery with the serpent that's what second Corinthians 11 is clearly speaking about people will get you caught up and say well beguiled doesn't mean sex sure it doesn't it means deceived but the whole context means sex very clearly the there we don't you don't need to come to a fanciful interpretation the scripture says exactly what it means if if Paul was concerned about the church committing adultery he Compares it to Eve's sin what was Eve's sin eating apples it can't be it's very clear adultery was the original sin Matthew 13 37-39 . he answered and said unto them he that soweth the good seed is the son of man the field is the world the good seed or the children of the Kingdom but the tares are the children of the wicked one the enemy that sowed them as the devil the Harvest is the end of the world and the reapers are the Angels so the question in my mind I have is are we to just take that scripture take this as something spiritual like the works that you produce means that you're of the devil if you do good works so we can choose what we want to do I think this is the world the world view and the understanding of so many um people in Christianity Today you get to choose if you're going to be a children of the child of the devil or a child of God it's your choice it's up to you you can you can make your decision to be which one of these well that's not scripture there's there's genetics behind this there's election behind this there's a there's a stream of life and I think that's the thing that's so lost and misunderstood in Christianity is that God you know you look at let me back up a second you look at how the average Christian looks at a human and the Body Soul and Spirit they have no understanding whatsoever of genetics or or the origin of man or what God's purpose is for man they look and see man is made in the image and likeness of God that just means he's intelligent okay so where did where do we draw the line because dolphins are intelligent other animals are intelligent so does that mean they share some of the image of God obviously not when you look at image and likeness it means that this is going to be an expression of the character and nature of who God is in other words this is a man this is a visible manifestation of the invisible God God is invisible he wants to make himself visible right and I'm I'm skipping way ahead of myself we'll get we'll get we'll lay the scriptures in later but God breathed the spirit of Life the Breath of Life literally the spirit of lives into Adam so the the the the the the the the god race that God was purposing to bring forth through Adam oh people are going to hate that terminology say that's not biblical it absolutely is biblical in if you saw my podcast I spoke about it uh on on Friday but there in uh II Peter he says we're made partakers of the divine nature having an escape the corruption that is in the world through lust we're made we're we're literally participants of the Divine species that word nature it means species or genus so we are the god race the god species so God in other words we're not God we're not we're not omnipotent omnipresent omniscient but when our faith makes connection with God we become that right but nevertheless we're not objects of worship brother Brandon says we don't forgive sins but that life was to come into Humanity come into flesh and put God himself on display right so this is what's missing in Christianity they have no understanding of that they just think we're humans God created us we're his creatures and he adopts us and puts us in a position of being his sons no they missed that there's a whole stream of Life coming from Adam and of course we understand that's what serpent seat shows us there's a hybridization of that life there's an injection of this is my next scripture I'll get to it right now Ecclesiastes 3 18-21 of course we understand when we're looking at Ecclesiastes Solomon is writing about things on the earth and then these things writing on the things under heaven in other words from God's perspective and from Human perspective this scripture he's looking at it both directions he's starting out on the human perspective without God in the picture that's why he says vanity is Vanity all is Vanity that's true without God but with God it's not vanity so Ecclesiastes 3 18-21 I said in my heart concerning the estate of the sons of men sons of Adam that God might manifest them and that they might see that they themselves are beasts they're animals hmm for that which befalleth the sons of Adam befall befall as beasts or animals even one thing befalleth them as one dieth so die at the other yea they have all one breath so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast for all his vanity all go unto one place interesting all are of the dust and all turn to dust again again this is human perspective this is from the perspective of those on the earth looking at what's happening the animal dies so does a human being what does he what is he any better than him all go under the same place what place he's not talking about the afterlife all go back to dust they go big buried in the ground but then he goes further who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward in the spirit of the Beast the spirit of the animal that goes downward to the Earth so we have two directions the spirit of at the Spirit of Adam the spirit of the sons of Adam is supposed to go up right the spirit of the animals it says it goes downwards well how do we how do we get this picture how do we understand that we we understand that animals were were to be immortal when God created them were animals supposed to die they weren't supposed to die neither were we it was supposed to continue in life now animals die why because they're under the curse that got put upon Adam got put on the head of humanity it's Romans 8 20 and 21 for the creature or the creation was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who has subjected the same in Hope because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the Glorious Liberty of the children of God so there's coming a time where the animals will be immortal right they won't die and you can talk about that if you know your beloved pet is going to be resurrected I believe that's certainly a possibility we'll we'll see our you'll see your pets again in the on the new Earth and different things and there's animals and horses and different things will God create them from the dust to the ground to have a Immortal species of animals or will he re you know bring bring our horses and our beloved animals maybe he'll do all of that on the new Earth but we know that they're going to they're going to be delivered from the bondage of corruption like we on the inside have been delivered from the bondage of corruption but not on the outside when we when on the outside we are delivered from the bond of of corruption that follows suit that the animal kingdom all of creation is going to be delivered from the bondage of corruption we're just waiting for the adoption to wit the Redemption of our bodies when that comes all creation that they're groaning the groaning will be over with and so we thank the Lord for that but then we we understand in all of this that the animals they die now and we die all of us are subject to death because of Adam's sin now e Eve injected that other life into the human race let me just go forward in this I'm trying to explain everything and I'm jumping so far ahead of myself prior to the fall both animals and the human race were immortal after the sons of God lineage maintained spiritual and immortality and eternal life their bodies were subject to death but on the inside they could never die because that's God's life in the in the genes of the Soul so animals do not have spiritual immortality the breath or Spirit of animals goes down the breath or Spirit of the sons of Adam goes up but there was an animal life from the serpent injected into the human race John 6 53 then Jesus said unto them verily verily I say unto you except you eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you so there's a life in you that's going to cause you to eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood there's a life in you that's going to cause you to Feast on the word right that life is there it's in there by predestination why do we got to click this thing 17 times to go to the next screen brother Jason I don't know what's going on with that First John 3 15 whosoever hates his brother is a murderer and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him interesting you know the grace of God can overcome even this because David was a murderer but if you if you're a murderer and you stay as a murderer and there's no eternal life abiding in you so in other words you see the other scripture I had there's life there that causes you to Feast on the body word of the son of man here there's no life in you you don't have eternal life and when you don't have eternal life you're going to produce the works of not having eternal life see the serpent has no life in it they cannot hear the word it's a hybrid life it can't reproduce eternal life it's hybrid it's dead they cannot hear the word because there's no place for the word in them they can't suffer eternally in hell that was part of our previous subjects because they don't have eternal life they're not Immortal they continue to exist after death due to their hybrid condition with Eve remember Eve's life was injected there which was part of God's own life thank you First Timothy 6 16. who only hath immortality again some of the fundamentals we're starting with God Alone is immortal no one else is immortal but God himself passes his life on through the son to us as the father has life in himself he's given to the son that logos that went out of God the life that was in that logos you were in that you're a part of that life that life is the son you are in the sun therefore you have life it's not as though you found yourself in the sun now because of the choice you made the choices you made through life as I said at the beginning many of the denominational World they think you can choose to be a child of the devil or you could choose to be a child of God you cannot it's the the life that's in You by election if you were in Christ you were in him before the foundation of the world you were in him when he died before the foundation of the world your name was put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world so God watched over that seed in the human race I'm never going to get to this quote probably next time or the time after that but brother Brandon says the Virgin birth isn't half as mysterious as the natural birth and he begins to describe how that Gene of eternal life is passed on in through the human race and it's born in this one and that one same family you got a Jacob and you gotta Issa one can't value the birthright one his whole life is the birthright and that's you maybe your own family you see that one they have no value the birthright has no value the word has no value another one it's your whole life what is it it's God's predestination he that hath the son hath life first John 5 12 and he'd hath that hath not the Son of God hath not life how do you get the Sun you believe in his name how do you believe in his name as many as ordained or eternal life believe you can't run away from predestination I'm sorry you might want to try to run away from it but you're not going to get away from it when you see this process as I said before the Christian world has no idea about the gene of life that's coming in through Adam and to the rest of the human race they have no of course they have no idea about serpent seed so they don't see how it's hybrid and why we need to be born again they just think why we just need to be born again we it needs to be blood why does it need to be blood God isn't randomly choosing this it has to be blood because the bloodline was perverted it has to be a new birth because your first birth was hybrid all of us are carrying within us why do you sin you have the serpent traits within you you have a hybrid life in your flesh that was passed on to the whole human race through Adam and and uh Adam through Noah and his wife and and his hamsham and japheth and their wives all the whole human race is infected with that sin right there is a perfect example of the election right and at right in Noah's family one of them terrible sinner another one righteous loves God Genesis 1 26-27 let us make man in our image after our likeness let them have dominion so here's God's purpose he makes man In His Image to be a vice Regent to be his ruler upon the Earth God was going to rule just as Pharaoh Pharaoh just relaxed when he had Joseph right Pharaoh had had duties and things of state but really Joseph did most of the work and that's that's where he wants us he wants us in this position of taking Dominion God God has his his duty and his purpose but he's doing it through you he's operating through you and that's this is what God is doing he puts a part of his life in a body of Flesh and says multiply multiply what that same life what did Satan attack man with how he would fill his belly whether he would have too much pizza whether he would eat an apple well you can eat this one what was the Tree of Life maybe it was raspberries or blueberries I'm not sure and in the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil is it either an apricot or and Apple so God says multiply and replenish the Earth and Satan attacks them about the food kind of food that they eat restrict your diet that's what the gospel is Right restrict your diet spiritually speaking yes and again spiritually speaking yes at the beginning right it's it it's speaking of the direct attack against God's purpose and plan which is multiplying and filling up the Earth so instead of doing it God's way they pervert Satan perverted it and twisted it and did it his way and by that injected a foreign substance into the genetics of God and the Lord God formed man of the Dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and Man became a living Soul it's very interesting to me if you look at the Hebrew it literally means the breath of lives or the spirit of lives in other words God put into Adam all the lives that were to come for forth after that Adam was the head of the human race so when he sinned we sinned in him and that was death was passed upon all of us then God replaced Adam thank the Lord with Christ the second man first man is of the earth earthy the second man is the Lord From Heaven the second man comes and his his life is perfect sinless he sheds that perfect blood not it's not a hybrid blood but it's the very blood of God the very Divine Life of God in the form of a man his very blood was shed for you it had to be that perfect blood because your blood was perverted your blood was hybrid so that perfect life the life is in the blood that perfect life sheds a perfect blood so that you could receive his life back on you and be changed and have the right kind of birth to have but so in other words the breath of lives this was to bring forth all the children of God through Adam Adam fell by sin by hybrid by hybriding Adam didn't hybrid Eve did that was injected to the human race now Christ has to come to take those lives that were in Adam and redeem those lives you are in Christ at Calvary you were in Christ when he raised up right in Blasphemous names brother Branham says but God especially upon Adam breathed the breath of eternal life and he become an eternal person with God that's incredible think about that we understand this the very life that was in Adam was in God from the ver from from for all eternity God doesn't have new thoughts we've studied this before God doesn't God isn't adding to his thoughts he's not coming to New conclusions when he chose you he chose you for all eternity and your life is a part of his life so what is this being said God put into Adam that portion of life that was in God for all eternity it was in his soul it was in his soul when you're born on this Earth we talked about it last time because you are Sons God sent forth the spirit of his son into your heart whereby you cry Abba Father you're when you're born on this Earth that Gene of God is there in your soul and brother Branham talks about this multiple different occasions the gene of God doesn't come to you when you're born again the seed of God doesn't come to you when you're born again it's there it's laying in there and that's why President says you couldn't fit in you never could figure out how to do like the rest of the world sure you did many of the things like the rest of the world but yet some something there was hungering something there was thirsting it says down in there there's this little speck of eternal life he said there's another William Branham right waiting to be birthed into in into not into existence but into manifestation amen yes we got to that First Corinthians 15 22 as as an atom all die even so in Christ shall all be made alive so we look at this this is some review so the word Genesis is the Greek translation of the word beginning in the beginning uh then we look to the New Testament we have a carryover the word only begotten for the only begotten son that's monogeneo the unique one of a kind begotten so our term Gene has the same origin Gene is a unit of heredity which is transferred from a parent to offspring and is held to determine some characteristic of The Offspring so when you look at when you open your Bible and see Genesis you know what you should think this is the history of the genes this is the history of God's genes coming into manifestation Gene speaks of origin in connection with characteristics it's the same idea behind the word attribute brother bear says you're you were an attribute of God in other words some characteristic of God needed to be expressed and that's you our nature and our characteristics come from our origin right so your Gene that's laying in you from the time you're born that God saw before the foundation of the world that is the real you that has to come to manifestation but it's covered over by another nature that it's that's born all around it it's it's another nature in the soul right and that nature has to die at the new birth that nature dies right and yet at the same time we know in our flesh we continue we continue to have to grow let's put it on the positive side we have a lot of problems and God is good when we're born again God is going to bake those out of us but the life there the life origin there is solved but now that life has to permeate the rest of your life and one one day it will completely when our bodies are changed so if you're here right now you're still in this life you can you can guarantee that God has a purpose for you and he has a plan for you and he's transforming you by the renewing of your mind you're adding word on top of word revelation on top of Revelation I'm just going to close with this because if I keep going that it'll be in the middle of something that doesn't make any sense so I'm going to close with this could I just say this to you if you are wondering how can I grow how can I grow into the life that God wants me to have is are you what are you feeding on what is your passion do you have a passion to listen to the message do you have a passion to read the Bible and then okay you have a passion are you actually doing it because that's that's the problem and that's the problem I face is when you get when you get cold about your desire to listen to the message and just read the Bible that's just you stop growing you don't lose your salvation but you stop growing so one thing I I'm suggesting for you to pray for if you want to grow into this life is ask God to restore your or give you if you've never had it before give you a passion to feed on this word and a burning desire to have a greater understanding and revelation of the message understand it's not an understanding like the world gains an understanding but it's a spiritual revelation God by his holy spirit as you're feeding on the word will drop that into your heart but there's a means of doing that you can't just go out into nature like a Buddhist and sit there and fold your knees and lay there quietly and wait for thoughts to pop into your head that's not how it works certainly there's prayer and we seek the Lord that's but that's not how God has ordained that we be transformed he says you're going to be transformed into the image of Christ by the renewing of your mind so it takes the word that's why God I mean why do we have such so much of the message today 1200 sermons of brother Branham because we're living in the most deceitful age that's continually putting things before you non-stop notifications non-stop information and God has given us non-stop revelation in the form of brother random's message and so we have to reverse what we're spending our time listening to and feeding on so I'm just encouraging you feed on the message and if you say I have no desire for that that's a good make your confession to the Lord I don't desire that forgive me Lord and change my desire change how I spend my time change what I'm feeding on Amen let's stand and we'll pray Heavenly Father we thank you so much for the revelation of this word Lord and to see the gene of God that's there in our soul and how Lord we're coming into the full growth in expression of what you had in mind before the foundation of the world lord it's as good as done
