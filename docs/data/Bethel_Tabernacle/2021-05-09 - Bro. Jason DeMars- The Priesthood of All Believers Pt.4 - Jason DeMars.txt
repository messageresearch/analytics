TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] so do [Music] [Music] you not our purpose our purpose is for the ministry of the word to this world that is our purpose sacrifice so there's no need for a priestly order to offer sacrifices on a continual basis in that sense number two there's a new covenant isn't the new covenant is an inner teacher that's given to each and every one of us there is an outward teacher there is a teaching gift but that teaching gift is different than the other than in the old testament it was all outward the teaching gift has an advantage now is that there is an inside teacher giving personal revelation to every single believer you don't need to go through the rabbi to get to christ you have to come to christ personally in a personal revelation and there's a teacher inside of you when the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth first corinthians 12 uh i'm skipping number two number three we are all called to ministry through the spirit dwelling within us number four the true church is an invisible mystical body of christ that was one of them that we really didn't cover and number five we are all equal in christ and have equal access in christ so first corinthians 12 7 i'm just going to cover this ministry portion of it briefly again i i was really struck by one of the quotes that i read last week and i want to be continually struck by it because it's it's incredible first corinthians 12 7 but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit with all profit with all means the common good or for the common benefit in other words every single person that's baptized into the body of christ by the holy ghost has the manifestation of the spirit in order to edify the rest of the body every single person has access to the gifts of the spirit right so we're called to a spiritual priesthood ministry to represent god to a dying world and to one another so from the church ages book this is the this is the quote that just uh floored me last week from the ephesian church age paul saw it coming but he warned them about this subtle priesthood that would come and take over with its false doctrines he knew they would implement a way of worship that excluded the people from any part in a holy spirit ministry and even right today among those who claim to be free and full of the spirit there is not too much freedom in the laity and the best we can see is a few preachers with inspired preaching while the flock just sits there and tries to absorb it this is a far cry from paul who said that when we all came together all had the leading of the spirit and all participated in spiritual worship and the church corporate has never learned this lesson from the scripture nor from history every time god gives a visitation of the holy spirit and people get free after a while they bind themselves right back to the very thing they came out of when luther came out of catholicism the people stayed free for a while but when he died the people simply organized what they thought he believed and set up their own creeds and ideas and repudiated anyone who said opposite to what they said they went right back to catholicism with a little different form and right today many lutherans are ready to go all the way back oh yes in revelation 17 that old had many daughters these daughters are just like mother they set the word aside deny the work of the spirit of god subjugate the laity and make it impossible for the laity to worship god unless they come through them or through their pattern which is nothing but a blueprint of unbelief from satan himself amen we're all called to be partakers in the spiritual worship that isn't just sitting in the pew and shouting amen when the preacher says something that you like i know i know that sometimes that's maybe presented that way not here but in some places spiritual worship is what he is what he's talking about is participating in the holy spirit ministry right in the ministry explained brother branham says in 1956 then when you come become in the body of christ then there's nine spiritual gifts that goes in every local church body and i want you to notice what he says in this next sentence because it's it's i believe it's a important and it's correction that i i'm receiving he says and those are gifts that you're to pray for so when's the last time you prayed for those nine spiritual gifts if we haven't we should we should be praying for that those are the gifts that you're to pray for to pray for the gift of speaking with tongues or the gift of interpretation in tongues or these other gifts that goes into the church pray for the gifts of healing and pray for the gifts of miracles and so forth that's the ones that you pray for now part of that is making a distinction between the five-fold ministry and the nine gifts of the spirit five-fold ministry don't pray for that you're ordained to that right you don't desire that but paul says about spiritual gifts earnestly desire the best gifts that is why brother branham says pray for them because how do you express earnest desire spiritual desire by praying for that i believe that we should be praying for that more i believe i should be if you don't want to that's fine but i want i want to pray for it because i want to see the manifestation of the spirit not just have a big party but so that we would ex see that edification that every portion of the body is supposed to be supplying it's not just a separated ministry preaching and edifying it's each one of you when you have the holy spirit are called to have that manifestation those manifestations in your life for the common good for edification not to be a big somebody not to say yeah i have i have a gift remember the real gift is to get yourself out pray and get yourself out of the way and let the let the lord move ephesians 4 11 through 16. i want to read this this whole portion because it's important i've said it before but i'm going to repeat it and he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting or the equipping of the saints for the for for the the dressing and preparation of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ so that's a continuation so the fivefold ministry is given for what for the equipping preparation of the saints what is that given for for the work of the ministry okay so the saints have the work of the ministry amen for what purpose so they can say hey look at me i got great gifts for the edifying the building up of the body of christ see that's a continuation i'm going to repeat it i want you to i want this to be memorized it's in because it's important otherwise you'll get it out of order you'll see it as there's an anointed ministry and we sit and we just take it in and brother branham condemns that model as the only model is that part of it absolutely that's part of it he's not saying that isn't part of it he's just saying that isn't the only thing that shouldn't be the only thing that we're focusing on period fivefold ministry is giving for the equipping the dressing equipping it's speaking of giving the art like giving armor to the military giving armor giving a sword etc in other words the preaching there is laying the word out so now the people have the word in their hands now the people have the word in their hearts to do what for the work of the ministry to build up the body of christ till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man till we all we all every part of the body till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ that we henceforth be no more children it doesn't say that the ministry be henceforth no more children that we every part of the body be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the slight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie and wait to deceive but speaking the truth and love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even christ i want you to look at this closely verse 16 from whom the whole body the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplies every joint supplies so every person that's baptized by the spirit into that one body has something that they are supplying to the rest of the body a gift a ministry to the rest of the body according to the effectual working in the measure of every part of the effectual working the the the work that has it has an impact it has fruit that's what effectual is speaking of effectual working in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love it is a whole it is the whole body of christ that has something to offer every person has to be filled with the spirit every person has to be led by the spirit every person has to be growing in maturity personally regardless of what everybody else around you is now i'm gonna i'm skipping ahead just a moment because this verse is contains some of what i want to talk about there is a visible church and there is an invisible or mystical church and we we don't want to get that confused and sometimes we get that confused and we result in disappointment and a lack of faith here what we have a gathering here is a visible church right and that we we baptize people we minister the word to people we have communion and foot washing we marry people etc that's the visible church doing visible things and all that is for the purpose of edification but that isn't exactly the church that christ is going to do these things in what is he doing it in because every church is made up of what brother brahma says believers make believers and unbelievers okay so i'm we're not it's not for us to figure out or understand who is we minister and love everybody exactly the same it doesn't change anything it's just a fact the visible church is made up of people who are believers and who are not believers people who stay and people who leave right so and he's not trying to perfect bethel tabernacle or happy valley church of jesus christ he's not concerned necessarily he's concerned with that and how we respond a real believer will go to church a troop baptized in the holy spirit knows the bible says to me i need to be in fellowship with other believers so we go to a visible church where the word is ministered where baptism takes place and the things that god's commands take place but he's not perfecting this group of people he's perfecting individuals in the mystical body of christ so when we come and we say i'm so disappointed in bethel tabernacle they didn't do this they didn't do that where are you in this ministry because again if you look at it as the church isn't doing what i want it to do the pastor isn't doing what i want it to do the way i personally look at it is i have a calling from god personally and it's not brother jason is not in charge of my calling i'm not in charge of brother jason's calling neither are you i'm no one is in charge of brother luther's calling in this mystical body now he's a deacon in a visible church that's something different right but the the the spiritual mystical body that i am called into i'm here to have an effect on you right i'm not here to say this visible church must meet my needs yes sure it should baptize me baptize my family marry my kids etc but that's all outward he's not perfecting outward you guys baptize i mean we want to baptize according to scripture what i'm saying is he's not perfecting our outward programs he's perfecting you on the inside he's bringing you on the inside into the unity with the spiritual mystical body of christ so you as an individual you have something to bring an effectual working within the body of that mystical body and we're all surrounded by three kinds of believers not for us to figure out that's okay but our if our vision is this visible church has to meet my needs your vision is incorrect you're looking at of course we want to go to a place that feeds us obviously not saying that's that that we wouldn't but i'm saying is if it feeds you are we looking at everything as a critical eye like it's all about me because it isn't all about you it's all about what you can bring by the spirit of god dwelling inside of you for others that's what gifts that's what this body is all about and it's your connection with him and our connection with him is what connects us together it's you we can be connected together as a visible body and we can work so hard to have a beautiful relationships amongst each other without god there's there's corporations that have a beautiful management structure and they have wonderful harmony but that is not what god is looking for god likes that of course but that's not what he's coming back for he's coming for a mystical spiritual body and until we've really have that revelation for ourself we can't operate properly in the body and under the leadership and headship of christ uh romans 8 26 likewise the spirit also helps our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered the spirit intercedes through the body through that mystical body by doing what by giving us groanings giving us burdens that we don't even know how to ex really true express on our own but he through us makes intercession in other words this christ is the only mediator right he's really the only intercessor he's on the throne interceding the spirit his his spirit the spirit of his son the spirit of jesus christ is here working amongst us and how is he interceding how is christ interceding many times he's doing it through us through our prayers through the things that he the groanings that he puts within us galatians 6 1 and 2. brethren if any if a man be overtaken in a fault you which are spiritual restore such a one in the spirit of meekness considering thyself lest thou also be tempted bury one another's burdens and so fulfill the law of christ so again this is a part of our spiritual ministry someone that's overtaken in a fault go to them in the spirit of meekness and restore them that's part of the spiritual ministry it's interesting it doesn't say you which are part of the fivefold ministry go and restore them he doesn't we're all to do that i think often people will see well this the the the shepherd goes after the 90 the one and leaves the 90 and 9 behind this pastor is not a good pastor because he didn't go after those people you're mixed up the spirit of jesus christ is in every single believer you which are spiritual every really it's i believe it's speaking of maturity but every believer is to be in a position of being spiritual because you're filled with the holy spirit you which are spiritual restore them the spirit of jesus christ is in you and you it's in your heart and you should reach out to them it doesn't mean your pastor shouldn't either all of us but we're waiting for the elite the elite to do the work it's not how it's supposed to be in the body of christ we're confused with catholicism or lutheran we have a professional class of ministers and the rest of us come and just sit in our chair sit in our chair and send our money in that's not christianity that's not apostolic each and every one of us have a heart that jesus christ lives in and that he is reaching out through to others it's not a healthy body that says our pastor is not going after this one you just wreck it so in other words you recognized that someone should go after that one and you said someone else should do it don't be a hearer of the word only be a doer of the word if god put a burden in your heart don't ask someone else to do it you be obedient to the burden that the lord placed there well i'm not going to finish again this time and i think that's the best place to stop so let's stand and pray grace of father we we thank you lord for your word i pray that you would take these things and and put them together by revelation in our hearts we know that no matter what is preached the devil can come and and twist it and and turn it around and send it in the wrong way lord i pray that you would take your word lord and write it in your people's hearts i i believe that's the only true and faithful way that anything good is going to be accomplished here lord is you take your word and you write it on the people's hearts lord we thank you for that we ask that you be glorified today we ask you to be with the worship team we ask you to be with the brother jason as he preached the word lord move in a mighty way amongst us we ask these things in jesus christ's name amen god bless you you
