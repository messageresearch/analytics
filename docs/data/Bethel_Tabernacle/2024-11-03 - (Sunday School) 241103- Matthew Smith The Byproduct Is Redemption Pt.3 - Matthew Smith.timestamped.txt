[0:18] good morning everybody stand and have a
[0:21] word of
[0:24] prayer gracious father Lord we come
[0:27] before you this morning this Sunday
[0:30] School father that Lord that it wouldn't
[0:33] just be something that I would have
[0:35] conjured up or Lord that we wouldn't
[0:37] have gathered here to hear
[0:39] some
[0:41] somebody's articulation of you know what
[0:44] they think your word says but Lord we we
[0:46] would have gathered here to hear from
[0:48] you father and that you would we would
[0:50] hear something that you would have to
[0:51] say for to us Lord that Lord our souls
[0:53] could be edified by the by the study of
[0:56] your word by the feeding upon the word
[1:00] Lord that we could gather strength from
[1:02] it and father we would we would initiate
[1:05] an act of worship by feeding upon it and
[1:08] saying that that's the truth Lord that
[1:11] we would recognize your word as the
[1:13] truth and apply it to our lives father
[1:16] we ask that you would be with us this
[1:18] morning speak to our
[1:19] hearts and that you would grant me
[1:23] the the calmness and the and the the the
[1:28] ability to step out of the way father
[1:29] father that I could step aside and allow
[1:31] you to speak father that it wouldn't
[1:32] just simply be me speaking or my ideas
[1:35] Lord but it would be you speaking and
[1:37] that there would be a a confidence that
[1:41] would come from the recognition that it
[1:43] would be your word we ask these things
[1:45] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:48] amen y'all can well let let's say remain
[1:51] standing uh for a moment um want to read
[1:56] um in uh gen chapter 1 verse
[2:02] 26 um this is a continuation of um of
[2:09] the we the thought we've been talking
[2:11] about um previously the last two Sunday
[2:14] schools I'd done um so we'll start here
[2:17] Genesis 1 and 26 and it says and God
[2:20] said let us make man in our image after
[2:22] our likeness and let them have dominion
[2:24] over the fish of the sea over the fowl
[2:26] of the air over the cattle and over all
[2:28] the Earth over every creep thing that
[2:30] creepeth upon the Earth so God created
[2:32] man in his own image in the image of God
[2:34] created he him male and female created
[2:36] he them and God blessed them and God
[2:38] said unto them be fruitful and multiply
[2:40] and replenish the Earth and subdue it
[2:42] and have dominion over the fish of the
[2:43] sea and over the fowl of the air and
[2:45] over every living thing that moveth upon
[2:47] the Earth yall can be
[2:50] seated um if you could put my PowerPoint
[2:53] up for me brother
[2:55] Caleb um so I want to as I said before I
[2:58] want to continue um this thought and um
[3:01] this all in case anyone had forgotten um
[3:06] I started the series by with this quote
[3:08] and just a explanation or a a little bit
[3:12] of a discussion about this quote it says
[3:15] um remember Adam and Eve both masculine
[3:17] and feminist in the original creation
[3:20] one but then he was separated by a rib
[3:23] notice but a byproduct and notice the
[3:26] only one of all God's creation of every
[3:28] animal and anything else she was the
[3:30] only one designed this way every other
[3:33] female was in the original creation
[3:34] every other female was in the original
[3:36] creation but Eve was not in the original
[3:39] creation see that had to be made that
[3:42] way we'll get to it after a while notice
[3:45] in this creation that she was in not in
[3:48] the original but a byproduct and in the
[3:51] creation now I don't want to hurt your
[3:53] feelings but I want to tell you the
[3:55] truth and you just sit still you're
[3:57] doing nice okay okay now um now in the
[4:03] original first part we discussed about
[4:05] how this quote so many people get hung
[4:07] up on this feels like it's an attack on
[4:08] women but we tried to show that there
[4:10] was it is not that way it is in fact
[4:12] that because she was a byproduct she had
[4:14] access to Redemption because she had she
[4:16] not been part of Adam to begin with and
[4:18] been separated from him then he never
[4:20] could have returned her back to himself
[4:22] okay and and redeem her that is a
[4:24] ultimately that this is a reflection of
[4:27] Christ the lamb slain before the
[4:29] foundation of the world world and his
[4:30] bride that was redeemed before the
[4:31] foundation of the world and that that is
[4:33] the image of God that they were created
[4:35] in and so that is the pattern that they
[4:36] had to fulfill okay I don't want to
[4:38] spend too much time uh recapping because
[4:42] I'm bad about making my recap the whole
[4:45] lesson um so we're going to part
[4:50] three now um I did want to say something
[4:53] after after part two I you know it I
[4:56] know that you know the topic that we're
[4:58] talking about as I said before you know
[5:00] and even brother brandom kind of pointed
[5:02] that you know noted this and recognize
[5:03] this this can be a touchy topic for
[5:04] people you know this could be kind of
[5:06] sensitive people don't want to kind of
[5:08] hits you where you live um hits hits
[5:10] some sensitive nerves sometimes and um
[5:13] you know brother JD with his sermon you
[5:15] know series he's been doing on the
[5:16] family on the word family which is
[5:18] excellent and everybody ought to go
[5:20] listen to The Archives or actually
[5:21] better yet be here for it
[5:24] um uh you know a lot of times he he he's
[5:27] dealing with a lot of topics and a lot
[5:29] of issues and a lot of things that
[5:31] people don't want to swallow because it
[5:33] doesn't feel good it kind of runs
[5:35] contrary to the way that we've been uh
[5:37] programmed by the modern Mo by you know
[5:40] modern
[5:42] society and so I just want to make a a
[5:46] take a moment to acknowledge something
[5:49] um when we're dealing with situations
[5:51] like this you know and topics like this
[5:53] that we know are going to be sensitive I
[5:56] guarantee you no preacher wants to be
[5:57] the guy who gets seen as
[6:00] that mean man who's just saying stuff
[6:02] that nobody wants to hear okay um
[6:06] but you know and a lot of times it it it
[6:09] can it can you know jerk a little hide
[6:11] off and and leave people feeling sore
[6:15] but bear in mind what The Minister's job
[6:17] is to bring you the word of God right
[6:19] this thing that is sharper than a
[6:20] two-edged sword now you'll notice things
[6:22] that are sharper than a two-edged sword
[6:23] are not cuddly okay it is not soft it's
[6:26] not something that you just want to you
[6:27] know in fact the more you snuggle up to
[6:30] the word of God the more it's going to
[6:31] cut you right the more it's going to
[6:33] it's going to go in there and it's going
[6:34] to start separating things out of your
[6:35] life and a lot of times people have
[6:37] things that they don't want to let go of
[6:38] they have things that they don't want to
[6:40] they you know they they have their their
[6:41] pet thing that they don't want to let go
[6:43] of and a lot of times um God's going to
[6:46] deal with that and it's going to be a
[6:48] little bit harsh if sometimes coming
[6:49] from the pull pit however it's the least
[6:51] harsh encounter you'll have with the
[6:53] word okay because if you don't let if
[6:56] you don't allow the word to deal with
[6:58] you in in in in a
[7:00] Church you know the fine gentle scalpel
[7:03] of the word to cut away that thing from
[7:05] your life in church then the Lord will
[7:07] fire up the chainsaw of the word and
[7:10] start hacking things away and I've been
[7:12] there and I've done that and it hurts
[7:14] way worse than getting your feelings
[7:16] hurt in church okay the Lord is not
[7:19] above chopping your hands off because
[7:20] you won't let go of something okay Jesus
[7:23] said if your if your hand offends you
[7:25] cut it off if your eye offends you pluck
[7:26] it out okay it is better that you go
[7:28] through some serious Ser
[7:30] suffering in order to get rid of
[7:32] something and that your soul be saved
[7:34] and God will do it and so you know as as
[7:37] ministers a lot of times we have to
[7:38] bring the word that doesn't feel good it
[7:40] doesn't it doesn't it's not something
[7:42] anybody wants to necessarily hear in
[7:45] their flesh but recognize what the
[7:47] minister is doing is he's seeing
[7:49] problems and he's he's bringing the word
[7:51] to deal with those problems and now
[7:53] imagine if you know we were walking
[7:55] through the woods me and my friend are
[7:57] walking through the woods and recognize
[8:00] oh he doesn't he's not aware that
[8:02] there's a bear trap in front of him and
[8:04] he's going to go walking into that and
[8:07] so in in the in the moment in the last
[8:10] minute I tackle him to the ground and
[8:12] and then he gets up all annoyed you
[8:13] knock me over and you skint my knee and
[8:15] tore my pants and you know what's wrong
[8:17] with you well there's a bear trap how
[8:20] much worse would it have been if I would
[8:22] have said nothing right you want to talk
[8:24] about oh you know the little skin on
[8:26] your on your knee the scuff on your knee
[8:28] ain't nothing compared to stepping in
[8:29] that bear trap I promise okay you know
[8:33] you know you you'll get over a little
[8:34] bit of hurt feelings you won't get over
[8:37] what happens if you disregard the
[8:39] warnings of the word okay that doesn't
[8:42] wash off
[8:45] so I recognize that nobody starts a
[8:48] sermon like this a preamble like that
[8:50] and everybody's going to ense up no's
[8:53] like get ready right this isn't going to
[8:56] feel good but no don't don't don't get
[8:59] too tense don't worry it's not it's not
[9:01] that crazy it's just the message of the
[9:03] hour that y'all have agreed is the word
[9:06] of your day
[9:08] okay so
[9:11] um now I and I and I say that because I
[9:14] I'm going to be reading a couple of
[9:15] quotes that that are dealing with some a
[9:17] lot of like Holiness and I dealt with
[9:19] some of this last time we deal with some
[9:21] of these Holiness topics because we're
[9:23] dealing with the differences between men
[9:25] and women and how the standard applies
[9:27] right how the standard of Holiness is
[9:29] going to apply differently depending on
[9:31] whether you're a man or a woman right in
[9:32] the original creation God created them
[9:34] man and woman male and female created he
[9:36] them therefor they're going to be
[9:38] different they're going to have a
[9:39] different kind of application the word
[9:41] is going to they're going to be it's the
[9:42] same standard as the standard of the
[9:44] word but the way that it applies to a
[9:46] man and a woman is going to be different
[9:47] because they're under different
[9:47] covenants right their responsibilities
[9:49] are going to be different and therefore
[9:51] uh the way God deals with them are going
[9:53] to be different so
[9:57] um uh let's see
[9:59] all right so this is from um trying to
[10:02] do God a service without being his will
[10:03] it says can't you feel the Holy Spirit
[10:05] screaming out from you oh United States
[10:07] and the world how of I would have
[10:08] gathered you but you would not now your
[10:11] hour has come your God of Pleasure your
[10:13] god of Filth your Sodom and Gomorrah God
[10:15] Has Come among you even our little kids
[10:17] Beetle haircuts and bangs across their
[10:19] faces and little perverts starting out
[10:21] our women is gone it's beyond Redemption
[10:23] our men has become big sissies walking
[10:24] around with little short pants on acting
[10:26] like a girl and hair hanging down their
[10:28] necks we are Sodom might and the fire
[10:30] and the wrath of God Waits For Us woof
[10:33] that's harsh okay not as harsh as the
[10:37] fires of hell that people will go to if
[10:39] they don't heed this but it's harsh
[10:43] okay it says now you have a choice of
[10:45] your conduct I'm going to it's going to
[10:47] hurt just a little bit here see you can
[10:50] go out and let your hair grow down and
[10:52] be a beetle or some of these
[10:54] ignoramuses or you women you can look
[10:57] like a decent human being or you can be
[10:59] one of these weird creatures that we
[11:01] have out there them blued eyes and
[11:03] Waterhead haircuts and things they're
[11:05] completely against the word of God which
[11:07] is absolutely contrary not even couldn't
[11:10] offer a prayer to be accepted that's the
[11:13] truth that's exactly right that's what
[11:16] the Bible
[11:18] saidof that's
[11:21] harsh now to put some some perspective
[11:25] on when brother there's two quotes and
[11:26] these are not the only two quotes is
[11:27] where he says this multiple times he
[11:28] links the the haircut of boys to the
[11:32] Beatles that is specifically somebody
[11:34] that he uses an as an example of an
[11:37] unacceptable uh uh uh perverted
[11:40] hairstyle for a young or any man to wear
[11:43] so I thought I'd look up what the
[11:44] Beatles look like a
[11:45] 1965 to create some context this is what
[11:49] he was referring to okay just in case
[11:53] anyone was
[11:55] confused okay this is all from when he
[11:58] said that
[12:00] okay I hope I don't need to make any
[12:02] more commentary than that um
[12:06] now before anyone gets upset at me or
[12:10] William brandom or anyone else who
[12:12] preaches
[12:13] that understand that we did not get this
[12:16] from William brandham we got this from
[12:19] Corinthians
[12:21] 11 okay we got this from the Apostle
[12:23] Paul now if you want to have an issue
[12:26] with me or or any other minister or or
[12:29] William brandom that's fine but I
[12:30] seriously suggest that you pump the
[12:32] brakes before you have an issue with
[12:34] Apostle Paul okay amen now this is I
[12:38] have this in the in the NLT um and I did
[12:40] this because um you know in in
[12:44] Corinthians obviously in in the in the
[12:47] uh King James it's a lot of translation
[12:49] and it got translated into some pretty
[12:50] archaic English so when you're reading
[12:52] through this it can be kind of hard to
[12:53] follow the wherefores and the th you
[12:56] know whatnots um also in the NLT they
[12:59] when they did the translation they put
[13:01] footnotes at the bottom of the page
[13:04] where when the translators were going
[13:05] through you could have a a certain
[13:07] phrase could be translated one way or
[13:09] could be translated another way and
[13:11] they're kind of synonymous with each
[13:13] other and so that way you can get the
[13:14] full context of what was being said
[13:17] there okay and so what I've done is um
[13:21] where you see everything that's
[13:22] underlined and then underneath of that
[13:24] in the brackets that's the footnote that
[13:26] I just inserted there so you can kind of
[13:28] see how this is you know uh how the the
[13:31] the connotation could be different so it
[13:34] says um I'm so glad that you always keep
[13:36] me in your thoughts and that you are
[13:38] following the teachings I passed on to
[13:40] you but there is one thing I want you to
[13:43] know the head of every man is Christ the
[13:45] head of woman is man uh and the head of
[13:48] Christ is God or the footnote you know
[13:51] could be translated as um to know the
[13:53] source of every man is Christ the source
[13:55] of woman is man and the source of Christ
[13:57] is God or another way to say that every
[14:00] man is responsible to Christ a woman is
[14:02] responsible to her husband and Christ is
[14:04] responsible to God okay verse four a man
[14:09] dishonors his head or dishonors Christ
[14:12] if he covers his head while praying or
[14:14] prophesying verse 5 but a woman
[14:17] dishonors her head or dishonors her
[14:18] husband if she prays or prophesies
[14:21] without a covering on her head for this
[14:24] is the same as shaving her head yes if
[14:27] she refuses to wear head covering she
[14:29] should cut off all of her hair but since
[14:32] it's shameful for a woman to have her
[14:34] hair cut or her head shaved she should
[14:37] wear a covering and that where she
[14:39] should wear a covering could be
[14:41] translated as should have long hair okay
[14:46] now often times in the message we we
[14:49] focus on the women having long hair do
[14:51] not forget that it goes the other way
[14:54] okay that the the standard is the same
[14:58] it is the the word there is a word
[15:00] standard set the way it applies to a man
[15:02] is one way the way it applies to a woman
[15:04] is another way but it is still the same
[15:07] standard and what it does the reason is
[15:09] because the woman is the feminist side
[15:11] the man is the masculine side and they
[15:13] come together to create one whole if
[15:15] they applied to them both the same it
[15:17] would they would if they were both
[15:19] exactly the same then they wouldn't be
[15:21] able to fit together right where you
[15:23] know when you put two puzzle pieces
[15:24] together the parts that stick out on one
[15:26] puzzle piece fit with the parts that are
[15:28] recessed on the other puzzle piece if
[15:29] they both stuck out they wouldn't fit
[15:32] okay if if you know in order for it to
[15:34] be a a a a word unit in order for it to
[15:37] be a cohesive unit in in in reflection
[15:41] of God and his bride they have to
[15:43] complement each other and they have to
[15:45] be different and it means they have to
[15:46] be held to a different standard amen um
[15:50] or rather the same standard but applied
[15:52] differently
[15:53] okay um uh where was I at um I wanted to
[15:57] read do I have any more no that's the
[16:00] end of my slideshow
[16:02] um okay so um going
[16:08] down
[16:10] um and I'm going to continue reading
[16:12] from the NLT here just briefly um I
[16:15] didn't have it up there
[16:17] um is this
[16:22] verse
[16:25] uh stting and we'll do verse 11 here
[16:30] um uh verse 11 but among the Lord's
[16:33] people women are not independent of men
[16:35] and men are not independent of women for
[16:37] although the first woman came from man
[16:39] every other man was born from a woman
[16:41] and everything comes from and everything
[16:43] comes from God judge for yourselves is
[16:46] it right for a woman to pray in pray to
[16:48] God in public without covering her head
[16:51] isn't it obvious it's disgraceful for a
[16:54] man to have long hair and isn't it long
[16:57] hair a woman's pride and joy for it has
[17:00] uh been given to her as a covering if
[17:03] anyone wants to argue about this I
[17:06] simply say that we have no other custom
[17:08] than this and neither do God's other
[17:11] churches
[17:13] okay
[17:16] now in this here you
[17:20] have uh we have quotes where brother
[17:22] Brandon is referring to um talking about
[17:26] women who cut their hair that they have
[17:28] uh no they can't even pray right that
[17:30] God won't even hear a prayer um I
[17:32] actually just now that's another quote
[17:35] that I had that I didn't put up um this
[17:37] is from a true sign that's overlooked
[17:39] says what we need is the go need is the
[17:41] gospel God rise someone in the scene
[17:44] that's right back to the word God said
[17:46] it's not even decent a decent thing for
[17:48] a woman to even come to church and pray
[17:50] with her hair cut and a woman that cuts
[17:52] her hair is a man has a perfect right to
[17:54] get a divorce from her she's a
[17:55] dishonorable woman the Bible said so
[17:57] she's dishonorable to her husband
[17:59] she uh maybe not know it and women will
[18:02] wear women that will wear shorts is
[18:04] dishonorable she might not know it lady
[18:07] I ain't trying to hurt you I'm trying to
[18:10] save you from the a lake of fire and
[18:12] Hell repent
[18:15] okay
[18:18] now here we have the word in Corinthians
[18:23] and through the prophet both indicating
[18:26] that a woman who cuts her hair dishonors
[18:27] her head and therefore
[18:29] it's unclean for even her even to pray
[18:32] okay that's really harsh right that I
[18:35] ain't going to lie that stings now let's
[18:41] turn
[18:44] to Malachi chapter 2 uh actually just if
[18:48] you can put it up on the screen brother
[18:51] Caleb um Malachi chapter 2 and verse
[18:56] 13 um and I'm going to turn there as
[18:59] well yeah King James is fine um actually
[19:03] uh if you have the NLT for that could
[19:05] you put that up thank
[19:07] you um and I'm going to read it uh here
[19:10] I change this up at the last second
[19:14] um so yall read along in the King James
[19:16] in your own Bible and and you it's up
[19:18] here on the screen in the New Living
[19:19] Translation and it says um this is Mali
[19:23] chapter 2 verse 13 here's another thing
[19:26] you do you cover the Lord's altar with
[19:28] tears weeping and groaning because he
[19:31] pay he pays no attention to your
[19:34] offerings and doesn't accept them with
[19:36] pleasure you cry out why doesn't the
[19:38] Lord accept my worship I'll tell you why
[19:41] because the Lord witnessed the vows you
[19:44] and your wife made when you were young
[19:47] but you have been unfaithful to her
[19:49] though she remained your faithful
[19:51] partner the wife of your marriage vows
[19:53] didn't the Lord make you one with your
[19:56] wife in body and spirit
[19:59] are his and what does he want Godly
[20:02] children from your union so guard your
[20:04] heart remain loyal to the wife of your
[20:06] youth for I hate divorce says the Lord
[20:10] the god of Israel to divorce your wife
[20:12] is to overwhelm her with cruelty says
[20:14] the Lord of Heaven's armies so guard
[20:16] your heart do not be unfaithful to your
[20:19] wife okay
[20:22] so yes a woman cannot it is unclean for
[20:26] a woman to pray God cannot hear her
[20:28] prayers when she comes before him with
[20:30] with her haircut and likewise a man who
[20:33] is unfaithful to his vows and dishonors
[20:35] his wife is also cut off it cuts both
[20:40] ways okay let's turn to
[20:45] um uh 1 Peter 3:
[20:51] 7 um and that can be just the King James
[20:55] um
[21:07] um and how much time do I got oh not a
[21:10] lot so I'm just going to read this one
[21:12] verse here um it says likewise ye
[21:14] husbands dwell with them according to
[21:16] knowledge giving honor unto your wives
[21:19] as un the weaker vessel and as being HS
[21:21] together of the grace of life that your
[21:23] prayers be not
[21:25] hindered okay so when when a man who is
[21:29] who when a man takes the marriage vow
[21:32] and he says I am going to be the husband
[21:36] I am going to be the leader of this home
[21:38] he takes on the responsibility to be a
[21:40] leader to be a spiritual leader to be a
[21:43] a a provider and a protector and he's
[21:45] taken a vow to have and to hold and do
[21:47] all of these things to love and to
[21:49] cherish and when he doesn't do those
[21:51] things when he breaks his marriage vow
[21:55] he is cut off from prayer
[22:00] okay that's what the Bible says okay so
[22:04] so this thing goes both ways yes when a
[22:08] woman dishonors her head she is cut off
[22:10] and when a man is a dishonorable head so
[22:15] is
[22:16] he okay it goes both ways and this goes
[22:21] all the way back to
[22:23] Exodus what am I talking
[22:25] about how many times in the message do
[22:28] we talk about a token home okay we're
[22:31] going to apply the token to the home
[22:33] we're going to apply the token to the
[22:34] home and and God will honor the token
[22:36] over your home except the token involved
[22:40] a cleaning of the house to apply the
[22:43] token involved a cleaning of the house
[22:45] involved a the the the household feeding
[22:48] on that lamb okay it wasn't as simply as
[22:51] killing a lamb and slapping some blood
[22:52] on the door okay it the whole there was
[22:55] a whole process there you had to slay
[22:57] the lamb you had to apply the blood and
[22:58] then you had to feed on the body of that
[23:01] lamb you had to feed it had to be
[23:02] roasted with fire there was this whole
[23:04] process you had to eat the whole thing
[23:06] the bitter herbs the unleavened bread
[23:08] don't forget the unleavened part you
[23:10] couldn't if you're feeding on the lamb
[23:12] while you've got leaven in your bread
[23:15] then your token is a
[23:18] fraud okay you you've appli I mean look
[23:23] you take a you take a man or you you
[23:25] know you see this stuff you know pop up
[23:27] on social media or something there's
[23:28] some guy and he's wearing a a military
[23:30] uniform trying to get his military
[23:31] discount at Lowe's or whatever and then
[23:33] here comes some guy who's like wait a
[23:35] minute that's all wrong your uniform is
[23:38] wrong you're wearing a Marine Corps
[23:39] fatigues with army patches and you know
[23:42] if you got a you know thing from the
[23:43] Navy on there because he's not actually
[23:45] a
[23:46] veteran right he's he's got stolen valor
[23:50] he's got you know he went to the
[23:51] secondhand store and and put on
[23:53] something that looks military to the
[23:55] untrained eye but try to get him to walk
[23:57] on base one time right he tries to that
[23:59] ain't going to fly with the real deal
[24:02] right they're going to they're going to
[24:03] spot that a mile away well that's what
[24:05] people try to do when they're oh we'll
[24:07] have the form of godliness on the
[24:09] outside we'll cut our you know we'll
[24:12] walk like this and present ourselves
[24:13] this way at church and we'll look this
[24:15] way and we'll do all this but at home in
[24:17] their
[24:18] lifestyle okay they'll have all kinds of
[24:21] Leaven in their home all kinds of
[24:23] nonsense in their home and here's this
[24:25] this husband or dad trying to say well
[24:27] I'm going to apply the token you what
[24:28] you've done is you've applied a
[24:30] counterfeit token you you've applied
[24:34] something that looks like the real deal
[24:36] it's it's red like the like the blood
[24:39] it's it's wet like the blood it paints
[24:41] on the door like the blood but it has no
[24:44] power to keep the death angel at the
[24:46] door has it's got nothing there's
[24:48] nothing backing it because you don't
[24:50] feed on the word you don't feed on the
[24:53] lamb you don't keep the leaven out of
[24:55] your home okay that's the you know
[25:00] boy we're out of
[25:03] time goes by quick when you're having
[25:05] fun
[25:07] um and uh I'm going to I'm going to at
[25:11] I'm going to okay I'll I'll take another
[25:13] couple minutes um but so it requires
[25:16] there's a standard that men have to
[25:18] uphold themselves to the the standard of
[25:21] of Holiness for women is submission and
[25:23] the standard of Holiness for men is
[25:26] leadership okay there's a it's the same
[25:29] standard of Holiness okay we preach
[25:32] Holiness a lot and typically the way
[25:34] people get preached Holiness is you know
[25:36] dresses and hair and this that and the
[25:39] other well the other side of that men is
[25:41] the are you spending more time on your
[25:45] deer stand than with a Bible in your
[25:48] hand okay I mean there are you spending
[25:51] more time hanging out with the boys then
[25:53] taking care of the needs of your family
[25:55] physically and spiritually
[25:58] when was the last time you had a family
[26:01] devotion with your family versus when
[26:03] was the time last time you made sure
[26:05] your own you know flesh was
[26:07] entertained right this is this is the
[26:11] standard of Holiness that men need to
[26:13] live up to
[26:15] otherwise they are the exact same thing
[26:19] that so many preachers want to preach
[26:20] about women right that's that's what it
[26:23] is now hopefully uh all right I'm I'm
[26:28] going to amen just jump to um hopefully
[26:33] is what I can move into next
[26:36] time um and let's turn to Ruth chapter
[26:41] 2
[26:51] uh and we're going to go
[26:54] to um
[27:09] let's go
[27:12] to
[27:14] uh let's go to verse
[27:18] six um and it say or actually let's go
[27:20] to verse five and it says and then Boaz
[27:22] said unto the servant that was set over
[27:24] the Reapers whose damsel is this and the
[27:26] servant that was set over over the
[27:28] Reapers answered and said it is the
[27:30] moabi is damsel that came back with
[27:32] Naomi out of the county country of Moab
[27:35] and she said I pray you let me glean and
[27:38] gather after the Reapers among the Sheep
[27:40] so uh she came and had um hath continued
[27:43] even from the morning until now and she
[27:45] tarried a little in the house and said
[27:47] then said Boaz to Ruth hearest thou not
[27:49] my daughter go not to glean in another
[27:52] field neither go from hence but abide
[27:55] here fast by my maidens let thine eyes
[27:57] be on the field that they do reap and go
[28:00] Thou after
[28:01] them um have I not charged the young men
[28:04] that they shall not touch thee and when
[28:06] thou are a thirst go into the vessel and
[28:08] drink of that which the young men have
[28:10] drawn and she fell on her face and bowed
[28:12] herself to the ground and said unto him
[28:14] why have I found Grace in thine eyes
[28:16] that I should uh take knowledge that
[28:19] thou should take knowledge of me seeing
[28:20] I am a stranger and boas answered and
[28:22] said unto her it hath fully been showed
[28:25] me all that thou Hast done unto my un
[28:27] thy mother-in in-law since the death of
[28:29] thine husband and how thou Hast left thy
[28:32] father and thy mother and the land of
[28:34] the Nativity and art come unto a people
[28:36] which thou knowest not heret for and the
[28:41] Lord recompense thy Work and a full
[28:43] reward be given of uh the Lord God of
[28:46] Israel under whose wings Thou Art come
[28:48] to trust now we'll pause there because I
[28:50] got to quit um but I would just like to
[28:54] point out that later on in the story he
[28:56] takes her to the house that they have
[28:58] lunch together he brings her to the his
[29:00] his you know and he feeds her of his own
[29:03] lunch basically that day and I would
[29:06] like to point out that this is the
[29:08] pattern Boaz and Ruth that is the same
[29:12] type as Christ and the church and is the
[29:14] same pattern as every husband and his
[29:17] wife okay that the way he deals with her
[29:21] is the way every husband is supposed to
[29:23] deal with his wife okay and that
[29:27] involves giving her attention and food
[29:31] okay which I guarantee you will get win
[29:34] the heart of every
[29:35] woman
[29:37] um the and what does he does he
[29:39] recognizes her character and gives her
[29:42] props for her character pins a rose on
[29:44] her for her character ensures that she
[29:47] is feels acknowledged for the sacrifices
[29:50] that she makes and how many times do men
[29:53] completely disregard all the hard work
[29:56] and the sacrifices of their wives that
[29:59] they've made and we think oh well
[30:02] whatever you know I told her I loved her
[30:03] on the day we got married if that
[30:04] changes I'll tell
[30:06] her uh because that's how guys typically
[30:08] think imagine if that's how God treated
[30:13] you oh I told you I loved you the day
[30:15] you got saved and I don't need to move
[30:17] the spirit in your life ever again I
[30:18] don't ever need to have communion with
[30:20] you in church ever again I don't need to
[30:22] let the spirit of God move in a church
[30:23] service and let you know that I care
[30:25] about you and that I love you and that I
[30:27] care about problems in particular ever
[30:30] again you know if it ever Chang
