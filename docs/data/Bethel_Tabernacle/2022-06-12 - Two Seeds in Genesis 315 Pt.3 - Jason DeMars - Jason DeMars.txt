Two Seeds in Genesis 3:15 Pt.3 - Jason DeMars
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
do do do [Music] god bless you let's stand and pray heavenly father we come before you in the name of jesus christ and we're asking for your mercy and grace upon us lord fill us with your spirit lord in your love and your light lord let your word flow through each one of us may you your name be lifted up and glorified this morning take your word and break it open to our hearts we ask in jesus name amen i'm going to continue looking at the two seeds of genesis chapter three and scripture we're going to read is genesis 3 14 and 15. if you want to bring that up all right and the lord god said unto the serpent because you have done this you're cursed above all cattle and above every beast of the field upon thy belly shalt thou go and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life and i will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed or thy offspring and her offspring it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel may the lord add the blessing to the reading of his word you can be seated so this verse is the at the end of 15 is actually the first prophecy of the messiah it's ultimately speaking of what christ did at calvary against the devil but isn't it interesting that the terminology that is used is you know offspring between your offspring so it's almost as saying as though the devil is the offspring of the serpent which of course we understand that's that's not accurate but if you take this if you take this back you run it all the way through scripture genesis to revelation it becomes simple to understand it's the offspring of the devil coming through the serpent seed line both of them both seeds both of these offspring come through eve but one is reckoned to be eve's proper offspring of course via adam but the other one is referred to as the serpent's seed that's where we get that title for that doctrine the serpent seed right from this scripture it's it's a direct biblical reference between thy seed who's thy he's speaking to the serpent so it's the serpent's seed and so the last two times we've spent spent time going through the scriptures genesis to revelation i want to just summarize that and move on to the very last thing because what typically happens has happened for me in sharing serpent seed with someone who's never heard it before is you go through all of this you speak all of this they're amazed and shocked and at the end they say but genesis 4 verse 1 completely blows your understanding out of the water it directly set tells us that cain is the son is the result of adam and eve over and over and over and over and over again you spend your time going through the whole scriptures and then it gets to the end or maybe they leave and they come do some research and then they come back to you and say but genesis 4 1. i mean how can you believe in that how can you understand that that's the that's what we're going to spend most of our time talking about and answering this morning so next slide so first it's god's command comes to the adam and eve even when they're still in spirit form as as a promise as a potentiality it's to multiply and replenish the earth that's god's first commandment along with taking dominion over it then come then in genesis 2 8 and 9 god commands them not to eat of the tree of knowledge which is in the midst of the garden and so we took time and showed that these are two figurative trees not literal trees revelation 2 7 shows us that then we look and we found in song of solomon uh chapter 4 verse 12 and 16 as well as in chapter 5 verse one uh the garden that these two trees are that the tree is in the midst of is the body of eve you can find and search through the message and see different quotes where brother branham points at different aspects of this sometimes it's the body of eve sometimes it's the devil himself if we understand the life source behind the two trees is the lord jesus christ and satan but they're not literally the lord jesus christ and satan they're two they're two things that are governing life in fact you can speak of it figuratively all through scripture to to eat of the tree of life today is to receive the message for your day that's eating of the tree of life eating of the tree of knowledge of good and evil it's eating a bit a little bit of the the word and a little bit of the false word from the false vine this is that that's what that's how you do it today but that's the law governing the the laws governing the reproduction of life god says if you eat of the tree of not tree of life you'll produce children with eternal life if you eat of the tree of the knowledge and good and evil it will produce death all right also we saw over and over again that the the garden was referred to as solomon's wife that was her her body speaking of that as a garden of course we understand there's a literal garden of eden but there's also trees in them there's trees that grow out of the ground and then there's trees that grow out of the midst of the garden all right so next slide proverbs 30 verse 20 shows that they shows what eating means eating is used as a figure of the sexual act it's also used in song of solomon chapter 4 5 and 6. and it's that's that was literally spoken of as this is the way of the adulterous woman she eats and wipes her mouth and says i've done no wrong genesis 3 15 god puts that enmity between two genetic lines it's not it's not merely a prophecy of the messiah and the devil but it's two genetic lines and the ultimate of the two genetic lines is jesus christ on one side and judas on the other side you see that brother branham talks about that but then it continues on even after that in the scripture all right jesus and the pharisees both refer to the original sin in john chapter 8 as fornication next screen paul refers to the original sin as adultery in second corinthians 11 and john references cain as being the son of the wicked one in first john 3 verse 12. so we go through all this i remember especially when i was uh going to bethel college as a baptist school and a lot of wonderful sincere believers there but when it would come to this doctrine you'd go through all of these things and they just sit there with their mouth on the floor just shocked to see it and then you say well just pray about it and we'll follow up again and talk in a couple weeks you come back and the the scripture they bring is on from on the next screen genesis 4 verse 1. and they take this and they say see here's here's a bomb that blows up everything you said i see the validity of what you said but here's the scripture you're done adam knew his wife and she conceived and bear cain and said i've gotten a man from the lord the first time someone said that to me i was like i have no idea my first response was you can't take you can't take one scripture and make it blow up the rest of scripture true statement but i think there's there's something even in even more important there if you click the mouse again i guess it'll bring up the next one yeah so in here's a little lesson in english we have past present and future tense but in hebrew they don't have that they just have two tenses perfect and imperfect perfect tense is a completed action imperfect tense is an action that's in process all right so let's look at the next screen and adam had known his wife and she was conceiving and she was bearing cane so when you look at this the tenses of that word it looks like it's all the same but in in hebrew they don't have uh punctuation there's no punctuation there's no period there's no exclamation point there's no commas there's no colons look look in your bible go back to the last screen look in that verse we have a semicolon commas and a period how did they do that when there's none of that in the hebrew well what their support what a translator is supposed to do is supposed to take the thought and the tenses of the verbs and make their sentences so here in this one they make it all one sentence i think they're trying to use the semicolon to to give some distinction if you look at a french translation i think french has a similar setup with verb tenses if you look at a french translation it has this as the first sentence and adam knew his wife period so end of thought moving to the next thought and she was conceiving so if you can go back to the last screen the next screen she was conceiving and she was bearing cane in other words adam had known that that's a perfect tense it's a completed action in other words this is like saying back back a little while ago adam had known his wife that's done and she was conceiving and she was bearing cain so the purpose of that those tenses is to show a distinction between the actions verbs are an action word so it's trying to show different actions there you say was that how they do it every time are you from you're familiar that the scripture brings this same phraseology multiple different times if you go to the next screen so we see here again and cain knew his wife and she conceived and bear enoch and he builded a city and called the name of the city after the name of his son enoch okay genesis 4 25. so we'll go back to that and adam knew his wife again and she bear a son and called his name seth for god said she had appointed me another seed instead of abel whom cain slew so let's go back yes right there hear the tenses of that verse cain was knowing his wife so it's all imperfect tense it's all action in process cain was knowing his wife and she was conceiving and was bearing enoch so again it's the same verb tense for each and every one of those words and then go to the next screen one more there you go same thing adam was knowing his wife again and she was burying a son etc so once again same verb tenses in this it's it's it's the same it's this it's actions multiple actions that are all connected together with the same tents so next screen and adam knew his wife and she conceived and bear cane and said i've gotten a man from the lord so you understand these are separate actions three different examples of verses looks exactly the same right should be should be similar what is happening here adam had known his wife period that's the thought and she was conceiving and she was bearing cane so does this itself in itself teach serpenceed no not by itself definitely not by itself but it should lead a person to go what's happening here because these other verses are different than this one why would this be different than those other verses because whoever's writing genesis god through through moses is trying to point out a distinction in the actions why would he write it this way why would he write it that way what what's what was the point of writing it that way just like the rest of genesis chapter 2 genesis chapter 3 it is hiding the truth in plain sight now in our english language it hit it even more it's incredible but if you dig a little deeper you could see exactly what this these verses are speaking about and this is this is important and i think i think everyone should remember this if you're sharing serpent seed with someone eventually if if they're astute enough they're going to come to this point where they say i'm dropping a bomb on you now but now you can answer no it's look at these other verses why is it why is it different no this verse doesn't prove serpent seed absolutely not but it doesn't disprove serpent seed absolutely does not it separates those two thoughts it makes them distinct and and that's that's that's key and that's critical i i i myself learned this um from the brothers in in turkey the iranian brothers the reason they discovered it was two of them speak the french language they saw it in their french bible saw this difference looked to the english and the persian bible didn't see that there so they began to study and and as i studied myself i found lots of different references to this specific thing and so praise the lord god hides his truth in in simplicity you know again we go back go back to screen number three you know looking at looking at all of these evidences why would god come he commands them multiply and replenish the earth let's skip the trees all right let's skip that portion and say all right i don't understand what this means it's very strange eating fruit and so forth is going to cause us to die i i don't i don't get that okay let me leave that aside i'll come back to understand that later then we go forward and we see the the serpent speaking to eve okay and again speaking about eating the fruit is pleasant to the eyes and a tree desire to make one wise all these different things all right you can grab that and just say if the bible is literal we cannot we cannot go and understand things this way okay all right we we have that but then immediately when god is putting let's let's uh if you want to bring up the scripture there in i think it's the first second screen god comes to the curses what is he doing look at the serpent he's he's literally changing his dna he's taking away his ability what was his abilities well he was able to speak this is not talking about the devil get that out of your mind people people think that the serpent is the devil you see all the it drives me crazy seeing the little children's book you know you're you're reading something to your children and they got the snake oh i seen one that the snake was a big giant lizard that was just recently goodness what a giant lizard that could talk no he stood on all he stood on stood on two feet he could he could speak he could reason so what is god doing here he's changing his dna so he couldn't do what he did before totally changing his dna structure all right then the in the next breath he says i'll be put enmity between thee and the woman okay well didn't he didn't he already do that by making him a snake there would in other words there's no affinity between the woman and the serpent anymore so god placing that enmity there that's finished but then it goes further between thy seed and her seed this verse right here should put stop us in our tracks because if that is a prophecy of the messiah which every christian catholic orthodox evangelical everyone who believes it everyone believes that so if her seed is the lord jesus christ that crushes the head of who the devil it's offspring so if you're going to say the serpent is the devil which many denominational people believe the serpent is the devil who is the devil's offspring it has to be answered because here it's speaking about offspring all right it's just spiritual it's just spiritual offspring well okay flip uh flip over to scripture josh and give me genesis 3 16. this is the curse god is placing on the woman as a result of her sin i will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children just the verse before he's talking about children right so thy seed thy seed and the serpent seed but no she ate from a tree she ate fruit so if she ate fruit the bible says an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth i will give you a toothache and stomach ache shall you have but here god is saying the part of your body that you sinned with i'm punishing this verse in itself should make everyone go what's happening here two two verses okay god said don't god said multiply and replenish the earth then he said don't eat of these two trees in the midst of the garden one brings life one brings death all right or he didn't say don't eat of two trees he said don't eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil that brings death the tree of life produces life of course then we see two seeds two seed lines spoken of the genetic structure of the serpent changed and here god says i'm gonna multiply your sorrow and pain in conception in sorrow you'll bring forth children and your desire shall be to your husband and he shall rule over you so we have genetics changing two seed lines enmity there a prophecy of the messiah pain and pain and sorrow being multiplied in conception and a desire towards her husband and him ruling over here it's so if if that's god's punishment and god is just an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth then what was the sin eating of a tree just ask yourself could it be figurative could it possibly be figurative of course we understand it is it's simple it's simple genesis 4 1 does not disprove serpent seed it demonstrates the truth of serpent seed that the act of adam is separate and distinct from the life that was produced in cain so obviously we understand there was twins involved the act happened very close same day that produced cain and abel born as twins so we're just going to close it right there if you want to stand let's pray heavenly father we're so thankful for your word we're so thankful for the light that you've shined upon it in this day lord lord what a glorious truth you've given to us lord what a life life-changing transforming truth that you've bestowed upon us it's your goodness in your mercy that does that lord as the scripture says it's given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven lord we say thank you lord for eyes to see and ears to hear by your prayer blessing upon the worship the preaching of the word may you you'll be glorified and your name lifted up we ask in jesus name amen do do do do do do so [Music] [Music] [Music] do [Music] [Music] do [Music] [Music] do do [Music]
