[0:00] it's claiming that they sincerely aimed
[0:02] at it and it's claiming that they
[0:08] faithfully performed their duties see so
[0:13] it can't just be a pleasant thought you
[0:17] understand it can't just be brother Brad
[0:20] and said God God's Word comes and into
[0:25] your mind and the whole purpose is for
[0:29] you to say it because when you say it
[0:32] you claim it and you set magical forces
[0:34] to manifest it but brother Branham says
[0:37] when when he puts that in your mind it's
[0:40] still only a thought until you say it
[0:46] see until you say it because when you
[0:50] say it that's the very first
[0:52] manifestation saying it is a
[0:55] manifestation of a thinking you say what
[0:58] you thought you thought it because God
[1:00] put it there and when and when God puts
[1:03] it in my mind that you are justified
[1:05] before the foundation of the world as
[1:07] though you never did I start to say it
[1:08] because as I say it that's the very
[1:11] first manifestation that I believe it
[1:13] and when I say it in that manifestation
[1:15] then you know what happens that
[1:17] manifestation just continues and
[1:19] continues to the next step the next step
[1:21] and I'm here to tell you I start living
[1:23] like that I start believing like that I
[1:26] start conducting myself like that and
[1:28] when the enemy comes in I say not for me
[1:30] I'm a son of God God has completely
[1:33] cleansed my life and that has nothing to
[1:35] do with my life so they stood firm they
[1:41] were faithfully performing their duty
[1:43] and they were sincerely aiming at the
[1:48] glory of God because that's what the
[1:51] Christian life is for you know when when
[1:55] you are aiming when you when you put
[2:03] together in your mind away a certain way
[2:08] to act a certain way to talk
[2:12] makes you look like a super Christian
[2:16] that's I've seen many many people who
[2:20] become very religious but they never
[2:23] really become more spiritual they just
[2:27] get more religious and they talk a very
[2:30] big religious talk and-and-and I mean
[2:33] can sit right in in the ranks of of
[2:35] message believers and and and you
[2:38] realize that that everything they're
[2:41] doing in Christian activity is and
[2:45] everything they're saying in Christian
[2:47] conversation is really glorifying their
[2:50] selves
[2:51] that's just religiosity that's not what
[2:55] Joshua and Caleb were doing Joshua and
[2:58] Caleb are striving to bring him glory
[3:01] you understand that they understood that
[3:05] to accomplish God's Word would bring him
[3:08] glory that's why when the 10 spies said
[3:11] we can't do it
[3:12] there's Giants they said we're more than
[3:15] able we can do it let's go do it because
[3:17] it wasn't that then they wanted oh I
[3:19] gotta have those grapes again I gotta go
[3:21] to now I want that land I want the best
[3:22] choice no it had nothing to do that it
[3:24] was that God had said it and they said
[3:26] we've got to bring him glory let us go
[3:30] about because if we take the land that
[3:32] it's his glory because we have proven
[3:34] his word to be true
[3:36] I want a something friends I'm not a
[3:38] interested one iota in bringing me glory
[3:41] but I wake up every day I want to prove
[3:44] to this world that his word is true that
[3:47] he's real and that he cares about his
[3:49] family and about his word I want to
[3:53] demonstrate that in my actions I want
[3:57] people to hear that I want that to be
[4:00] the message behind my words that when
[4:04] people come around me when they hear my
[4:06] conversation when they're around me and
[4:08] they're they're not born again they can
[4:10] see there's something more than this
[4:13] person that I'm talking to there's
[4:15] something more than this person behind
[4:17] this person that ought to be our
[4:20] striving friends
[4:22] always stumble I know we don't always
[4:23] get it right but I want to go every day
[4:26] as hard as I can to convince the world
[4:28] that this word is true
[4:32] there's no way hear me
[4:36] there's no way that you're going to
[4:40] convince the world of that if you're
[4:42] acting like them and I don't mean just
[4:49] be a better neighbor and have a little
[4:50] bit of a cleaner diet you know language
[4:52] okay you know so so you wear the right
[4:55] outfit pretty close and you don't cuss
[4:58] and drink and all that and that people
[4:59] know that about you but but you know
[5:02] there's Karris Mattox that do that I
[5:04] mean where we're trying to get them to
[5:06] something to say hey I'm not here to
[5:08] give you I'm not here to introduce you
[5:10] to a form of godliness there's there's
[5:12] movements and sects and people and cults
[5:15] that have a greater form of godliness
[5:19] than we do so I'm not here to present a
[5:22] form of godliness I'm here to present a
[5:25] reality of God then that people and and
[5:29] you you can't you can't you can't just
[5:32] do that by simply wearing the right
[5:36] clothes
[5:37] having the right hair and having the
[5:40] right conversation here's why that that
[5:43] won't work by itself they might think
[5:46] you're a nice person and a decent person
[5:48] and yes he or she's pretty moral but
[5:51] that's not gonna that's not really going
[5:53] to get the get get did the goal of
[5:55] converting them because here's the
[5:57] principle you can't forget you can't
[5:59] give out what you don't have you can
[6:03] only I don't care how you dress or what
[6:05] your conversation is or what you look
[6:07] like if you don't have that Shekinah
[6:09] inside you can't give it to somebody
[6:11] simply by showing up in a form of
[6:14] godliness they might appreciate that but
[6:16] that's not going to save their lives
[6:18] you've got to have a surrendered heart
[6:21] that the glory of God I'm talking not
[6:24] I'm not talking about something natural
[6:26] I'm not talking about how you can
[6:28] naturally have a form of godless I'm
[6:30] talking about another being that
[6:32] supernaturally emanate
[6:34] through you to them that they can't even
[6:37] quite put their finger on but they're
[6:39] affected by it
[6:41] they're not just impressed with you
[6:44] they're smitten they're pricked in their
[6:47] hearts they're something they realize
[6:49] that it's it's fine if if you impress
[6:52] people and and if people admire you
[6:55] because of the way you look or dress or
[6:56] go or don't go but we're not here just
[6:59] for that and you're never gonna convert
[7:02] anybody like that you've got to have the
[7:04] living presence of the Living God
[7:06] burning down inside you and then he will
[7:10] operate through you in a supernatural
[7:12] realm that will be way beyond how you
[7:16] think dress talk speak walk however a
[7:19] man you understand friends the Gospels
[7:22] of reality the gospel is not a list of
[7:26] do's and don'ts the gospel is not a
[7:29] legal code the gospel is not a not a a
[7:32] dress code we don't you know I don't I
[7:36] don't dress the right way and talk the
[7:37] right way because it's my obligation I
[7:39] dress and talk that way because it's
[7:41] natural my Christianity comes natural my
[7:46] faith comes natural my enthusiasm comes
[7:49] natural my desire for righteousness
[7:52] comes natural see and this is this is
[7:57] the evidence of the Holy Ghost not a
[7:59] form of godliness that's not an evidence
[8:01] of the Holy Ghost
[8:02] you understand that and and works
[8:05] Christian works brother Branham said a
[8:07] hybrid a mule can outwork a thoroughbred
[8:10] horse any day of the week when the when
[8:13] the horse is done for the day um you can
[8:15] just keep right on going said he and
[8:17] works he can outshine anybody but he's
[8:19] still a hybrid you understand can't
[8:23] reproduce anything see all right so so
[8:27] he they had stood firm they had not
[8:31] wavered Caleb and Joshua had stood firm
[8:35] and this is an important point
[8:37] they stood firm and they stood fearless
[8:41] in a day of of prevailing unbelief a day
[8:48] of of absolute general apostasy I mean
[8:52] we're talking about there was 12 spies
[8:55] 10 of them that's more than 2/3 of them
[9:01] 10 of them are are are denying God's
[9:07] promise but in a day of of prevailing
[9:12] unbelief that's where they stood
[9:14] fearless and that's where we have to
[9:18] stand in a day of prevailing unbelief
[9:20] and we were talking about in the men's
[9:21] meeting on Saturday the men's Bible
[9:23] study you know if we we have such a
[9:26] unique hour that we live in because in
[9:29] the early church every church was a
[9:31] messege church today we're not even 1%
[9:33] of the churches globally but here we are
[9:37] in a world of prevailing unbelief and
[9:39] general apostasy that's an
[9:41] understatement the whole world is in
[9:43] apostasy Ichabod has wrote over all
[9:46] their doors God is not in their churches
[9:51] listen friends
[9:52] that's the say the Lord God is not in
[9:55] those churches I don't care that they
[9:57] read the Bible and sing songs and cry
[9:59] real tears God is not there they're
[10:02] worshipping Lucifer and the end and in
[10:08] the tribulation the only ones who will
[10:11] who will have a chance in the
[10:13] tribulations are those who come to their
[10:15] senses and realize this is the mark of
[10:18] the beast and don't and won't take his
[10:20] mark and they'll die in the tribulation
[10:23] and there will be no doubt many there I
[10:25] don't discredit that I know there'll be
[10:27] a remnant and I know there will be those
[10:28] who are granted eternal life but don't
[10:30] be mistaken today there is no presence
[10:34] of God in any church except where his
[10:37] divine full revealed word is being
[10:39] ministered and believed by people that
[10:45] doesn't mean Bethel Tabernacle that only
[10:48] includes Bethel Tabernacle if we're
[10:50] preaching the full revealed Divine Word
[10:52] and people are believing it and the word
[10:55] is going from ink on paper and living
[10:57] behind him
[10:59] that's what makes us a true church not
[11:02] because we have better theology having
[11:08] better theology only makes us more
[11:11] responsible see makes us more
[11:15] responsible they had stood firm Moses
[11:24] had had had commanded the people and he
[11:27] reminded them and we won't read it today
[11:29] we won't even go there but Deuteronomy 3
[11:31] you can read it at home where Moses is
[11:34] preaching to the people he says I
[11:35] commanded Joshua at that time you know
[11:38] uh you know when during the time where
[11:42] they overthrew those 2 kings of bhishan
[11:45] and OGG and and he says to Joshua thine
[11:49] eyes have seen all that the Lord your
[11:52] God hath done unto these 2 kings so
[11:56] shall the Lord do unto all the kingdoms
[11:59] that you pass so Moses is reminding
[12:02] Joshua
[12:03] listen Joshua you saw what God did
[12:07] here's the point you need to realize God
[12:11] finishes what he starts when God starts
[12:15] something God finishes it and and you
[12:18] know he doesn't he doesn't finish it in
[12:20] a different way then he started it he's
[12:23] Jesus Christ the same yesterday in
[12:25] forever brother Henry green way back in
[12:27] the day gone on to be with the Lord now
[12:28] one of the one of the heroes of faith
[12:30] that I grew up under as a child he used
[12:33] to always say God started his church
[12:36] exactly like he wanted it and now he
[12:39] wants his church exactly like he started
[12:42] it God he listened friends you ought to
[12:44] rejoice because he who begun a good work
[12:46] in you will see it through he is going
[12:49] to complete he didn't save me to lose me
[12:51] he hasn't revealed all of his word to me
[12:53] for me to somehow get lost in this
[12:55] wilderness of unbelief no
[12:58] I'm more secure now than I was yesterday
[13:02] hallelujah every passing day that I
[13:04] believe his word so we find then that
[13:10] that this principle applies to us today
[13:13] because you know Israel lost their
[13:15] prophet yeah they lost their prophet but
[13:19] when they did did that stop him from
[13:22] crossing over see did that stop him from
[13:25] taking Jericho no see so instead of
[13:29] settling the land no but Jason was
[13:31] reading the scripture this morning
[13:33] showing how that Paul come into the
[13:36] church because they were obedient in his
[13:39] presence he says but now I'm also
[13:42] positive that you're more obedient in my
[13:45] absence I'm here to take some friends
[13:48] there were there were people when the
[13:50] Prophet was here present who fished with
[13:52] him and who camped with him and who
[13:55] hunted with him and whom who were
[13:58] neighbours to him and they went to his
[14:00] meetings in winters church and after the
[14:02] Prophet left the scene they became less
[14:05] obedient but there was some who and
[14:09] since the Prophet has been gone the
[14:11] principal is now we're to be even more
[14:14] obedient and I think about myself and
[14:16] about the majority of you here today
[14:18] almost all of you who were not
[14:21] privileged to be in those province
[14:22] meetings and you never saw those things
[14:24] done but today I am more obedient than
[14:26] many of those who walked with him who
[14:29] walked no longer so they didn't need
[14:33] Moses to come back they had Joshua the
[14:36] Holy Ghost to take them over and so we
[14:41] find then that that same evidence and
[14:43] power of the word and the spirit that
[14:46] operated in the life of brother Branham
[14:48] you know something friends you have this
[14:50] guarantee that if we follow closely in
[14:54] observance and dedication and sincerity
[14:57] then I can tell you surely that your
[15:01] life will produce the same things now
[15:03] under Joshua under this third pole
[15:07] you'll be
[15:08] to produce the same things in power and
[15:11] demonstration in your life that a
[15:13] prophet demonstrated said but I'm not a
[15:15] prophet you don't it wasn't it wasn't
[15:17] just brother Brandon being a prophet it
[15:19] was how he was such a Christian he was
[15:21] such a Christian because he was
[15:22] dedicated to God and and and even the
[15:26] Lord told him as a Christian when he
[15:29] showed him the the Mamba and he says in
[15:32] that third pole and he says now you have
[15:34] to be more sincere than you have been in
[15:39] order to do this and we are living in
[15:42] the aged friends uh uh you know and and
[15:46] I guess therein lies the rub that that
[15:49] whole level of sincerity as sincere
[15:53] children of God that to maintain our
[15:59] sincerity in a world that everyday seeks
[16:03] to rob you of just that to try to stay
[16:07] spiritual in a world that everyday seeks
[16:11] to drain you of your spirituality and
[16:15] most of it you can't even not contact
[16:19] most of it is you you have to contact
[16:22] this fallen world just to live just to
[16:26] get by just to exist in business and and
[16:30] in education you're going to constantly
[16:32] contact the tree of knowledge of good
[16:34] and evil you can't avoid it that's the
[16:36] age God put us in and so maintaining our
[16:39] sincerity and maintaining our spiritual
[16:43] strength is so vital and I know that we
[16:46] have human weaknesses but I want you to
[16:49] know this friends that if you if you can
[16:51] keep your sincerity before God and keep
[16:53] and do those things which create
[16:56] spirituality in your life I can give you
[16:58] this assurance your human weakness won't
[17:01] stop you from inheriting the prize God's
[17:05] never going to let your human weakness
[17:07] stop you from inheriting the prize
[17:09] because he's not grading you on the
[17:11] outside he's grading you on the inside
[17:12] he's looking at that heart of sincerity
[17:15] that you're striving daily you're
[17:18] pressing down
[17:19] you're on the move so your weakness you
[17:23] see lays in the laws of nature it's in
[17:25] your following flesh you understand that
[17:30] watch it now it's a law of nature just
[17:35] like the Sun comes up and goes down and
[17:38] the the solar system moves brother ham
[17:44] said with such synchronized accuracy
[17:47] that they can they can predict things
[17:50] just by the Stars
[17:51] many years in advance they know exactly
[17:54] where everything will be they can track
[17:56] it to where it's been and it all makes
[17:57] sense it bits because God made a grand
[18:00] design of it all and these are laws of
[18:03] nature they're why the world functions
[18:06] in spite of man trying to destroy it
[18:09] man's best effort won't destroy God's
[18:11] creation man will only destroy himself
[18:14] and God will let him do it and then
[18:16] God's going to set it all back to work
[18:19] properly but we realize friends that
[18:21] that that our weakness lays in the in
[18:25] the inner an inner in the nature of our
[18:27] flesh see and and that flesh is governed
[18:32] by the laws of nature but the advantage
[18:35] that we have is that the law within me
[18:40] remember Paul says that he says I see
[18:43] that in that you know that there's a law
[18:45] that in me you know in my flesh there's
[18:49] no good thing but he said but I I'm
[18:51] aware there's another law there's one
[18:54] that's working on the inside of me and
[18:56] that law is the word and listen friends
[19:01] do you realize that they if it's the
[19:02] word you believe that because that's the
[19:05] gene of God that's a part of the word
[19:07] that's why you believe the word cuz it's
[19:09] a part of you a man the seed of God the
[19:13] gene of God isn't some thing that God
[19:15] went and created it's a part of God God
[19:20] in the beginning was the word a man and
[19:23] God took a piece of the word a piece of
[19:25] himself and put it in you
[19:27] and so that which is in you is the word
[19:30] and if it's the word then it's prophetic
[19:32] if it's prophetic then it's a prophecy
[19:34] I'm here to tell you I realize that I
[19:37] have laws that govern the nature of my
[19:40] fallen flesh but I have a stronger law
[19:43] on the inside of me that's the law of
[19:45] the word hallelujah and that law you
[19:49] know what what does that prophecy what
[19:51] is the prophecy of the word within me
[19:53] that there's going to be a kingdom and
[19:54] I'm gonna be a part of it and it's my
[19:56] inheritance hallelujah that the dead in
[20:00] Christ shall rise and we which are alive
[20:02] shall be changed in the moment in the
[20:04] twinkling of an eye this is the law of
[20:08] the word that operates within me this is
[20:13] the law that governs my life that you
[20:17] say well what about my flesh I mean
[20:19] that's the law within me says
[20:23] prophetically he's going to change my
[20:26] flesh because jesus said flesh and blood
[20:29] cannot inherit the kingdom of heaven I'm
[20:31] so glad for that I'm so glad I don't got
[20:33] to take this sorry stinking pest house I
[20:36] don't know I wouldn't even want to do it
[20:38] and live eternity and live in heaven say
[20:41] well you get to be young I don't care
[20:42] then that just means I got to fight this
[20:44] guy forever I know I want the law on the
[20:47] inside that can rise up and say I'm
[20:49] gonna change this man on the outside and
[20:52] when he changes that man on the outside
[20:54] then the inside and the outside will all
[20:57] be under one law and that's the law of
[20:59] righteousness that's the law of Christ
[21:00] no wonder I love the word so much it is
[21:04] my earnest that I've got a new life
[21:06] coming in a new world coming and a whole
[21:10] new existence so don't worry friends God
[21:17] will all God's God will alter the laws
[21:20] of nature when needed you can see that
[21:26] in the crossing of the Jordan sea you
[21:32] know God God doesn't suspend the
[21:33] established order of nature without a
[21:35] good reason
[21:36] but he will
[21:38] God sets laws in motion here's a law of
[21:42] nature
[21:42] you-you-you can't walk on water I'm
[21:45] sorry that's contrary to the laws of
[21:48] nature but a man did to men did for a
[21:51] little bit
[21:52] a man the Son of God did it and a
[21:55] follower of the Son of God did it until
[21:57] he doubted you see God God when you're
[22:02] operating from that law on the inside
[22:04] you're not subject necessarily to the
[22:06] laws on the outside you find that that
[22:09] that that that he God would you know
[22:12] here here's a law of nature here's here
[22:14] some of the laws Israel dealt with
[22:16] here's some of the problems that they
[22:17] dealt with we're at the Jordan
[22:20] there's no way to Ford it it's running
[22:23] over its banks even if men could do it
[22:25] we're going to lose half our livestock
[22:26] and probably half the women and maybe
[22:28] all the children there's no way to Ford
[22:31] this river we I suppose we could camp
[22:34] here and build rafts and boats that
[22:36] would take a long time who knows we even
[22:38] who even knows then what would be
[22:39] happening the Jordans already
[22:41] overflowing
[22:41] I mean God put them in that position God
[22:46] puts you in these kind of positions God
[22:50] puts you in positions to where the only
[22:52] way you can succeed is if the power of
[22:56] God comes down and helps you and God is
[22:59] wanting you to understand that that
[23:01] you're never going to overcome the laws
[23:03] of nature by your own effort it's going
[23:05] to take God you're gonna have to be
[23:07] dependent on him it's not gonna be your
[23:10] education or your prowess or your or
[23:12] your concrete you're not even going to
[23:14] be able to conquer the land those 10
[23:16] spies by the laws of nature they were
[23:19] correct you're outnumbered the men over
[23:22] there Giants they have walled cities
[23:24] you've got nothing you don't have
[23:27] catapult a lot of ladders you don't have
[23:29] hardly anything all you got is
[23:31] everything you could carry out of Egypt
[23:32] you're gonna have no way to face the the
[23:35] Giants and the professional armies and
[23:37] Jericho are you kidding how you going to
[23:40] get past the walls they race chariots on
[23:42] they're so dead so God is simply showing
[23:46] them that yes this land of promise is a
[23:49] gift
[23:51] yes it's your inheritance but you're
[23:53] gonna need me
[23:55] hallelujah you're gonna need me at times
[23:57] to come in there's times when I'll face
[24:00] the temptation or you'll face the
[24:01] temptation and you know as well as I
[24:03] know you wouldn't make it but God will
[24:05] come on the scene and help you to get
[24:07] over and it wasn't you
[24:08] you give all glory to him is that I
[24:10] couldn't stand I would have surely
[24:12] collapsed but somebody came on the scene
[24:16] hallelujah
[24:18] he not only would stop the water like he
[24:23] did the Red Sea I mean that's impossible
[24:27] you you you can't you can't get the Red
[24:34] Sea or the Jordan to just open its
[24:38] waters and let you go across you
[24:42] understand it's not like there's
[24:44] somebody down there that you can talk
[24:46] them into it this is water this is
[24:48] uncrossable it son fortable and yet God
[24:52] is literally going to raise up the earth
[24:54] and suspend the water and they're gonna
[24:56] walk across just like they did in the
[24:58] Red Sea and it's not even good you know
[25:00] I heard a preacher years ago talk about
[25:02] you know they sliced right through mud
[25:04] and though the Bible says that it walked
[25:05] home to high ground hallelujah
[25:07] hallelujah listen friends not only not
[25:10] only did he suspend the laws of nature
[25:12] to open the Red Sea he suspended the
[25:15] laws of nature to open the Jordan later
[25:17] on he would suspend time itself when
[25:22] Joshua needed more sunlight he said a
[25:25] man a man said to the Sun stand still
[25:30] said to the moon stay over the valley of
[25:33] a Jalan and it you know what that Sun
[25:36] and Moon never moved say what was the
[25:38] circulation and this was what I don't
[25:39] care what it was all I know is for a
[25:42] whole extra day the Sun never went down
[25:44] until Joshua was finished and the battle
[25:47] was won I'm here to tell you God will
[25:50] suspend nature whenever you need it
[25:53] hallelujah oh my suspended time in fact
[25:56] is one time late
[25:57] after this not only later when he's to
[25:59] spend time later God would actually move
[26:02] time backwards take a sundial and
[26:06] literally move it backward you're going
[26:08] back in time later on God would
[26:10] literally float an iron axe head you
[26:15] can't do that that's against the laws of
[26:18] nature physics don't allow iron to float
[26:20] on water you understand so not only did
[26:25] he not only did he cause an axe head to
[26:27] float he caused all inanimate object to
[26:30] swim an inanimate object a piece of iron
[26:37] that's out in the middle of a river
[26:38] floats to the surface and swims back to
[26:41] the shore and a man reached out and
[26:43] picked it up this wasn't a fantasy this
[26:46] wasn't an illusion oh my goodness
[26:49] friends he he another man says Lord
[26:51] here's what I need you to do I know the
[26:53] laws of nature are that do Falls
[26:55] everywhere indiscriminately but I'm
[26:57] gonna lay a fleece out here and I don't
[26:58] want to do anywhere around it I just
[27:00] want all the dew that would be
[27:01] everywhere else to fall on that fleece
[27:02] and God did it in the next day he wrung
[27:05] it out a bowl full and there was nowhere
[27:09] else and he said okay God don't be angry
[27:11] I'm asking one more time now I'm gonna
[27:13] put the fleece back out there now I
[27:15] won't do everywhere but the fleece Oh
[27:18] hallelujah friends I'm here to tell ya
[27:20] don't worry little children it's the
[27:22] father's pleasure to give you the
[27:24] kingdom
[27:24] he'll suspend nature whatever he needs
[27:27] to if he can suspend that nature he can
[27:30] suspend this nature he can get me
[27:34] overcoming power and victory in my life
[27:37] oh my we won't even start on the
[27:44] supernatural life of Jesus or the
[27:45] Apostles see he he he suspends the the
[27:53] best laid plans of mice and men in
[27:56] history you know you you you read the
[27:59] history books I've and I'm read them for
[28:02] years and when you read about the
[28:04] conquest of the Babylonian Empire
[28:06] historians don't mention God in there
[28:07] nowhere and yet it was God who said I'm
[28:10] given
[28:11] this power and you're gonna use it this
[28:12] is what you're gonna do and there's the
[28:14] power and they use it and that's exactly
[28:15] what they did and he said now it'll work
[28:17] until another beast power rises up and
[28:19] then he'll come and crush you and then
[28:21] he'll be he'll be the one in charge and
[28:23] you know historians write about you know
[28:26] how that the Babylonian Empire ruled and
[28:29] reigned until the Persians arise and
[28:33] when the Persians come they're gonna
[28:35] crush down the Babylonians and they
[28:38] write about those strengths of the
[28:39] Persians and the feats that they how
[28:41] they defeated the Babylonians there's
[28:43] not one mention in there about God doing
[28:45] it and yet 100 percent of it was because
[28:51] God said it there's no record that you
[28:56] know when Alexander rises up and crushes
[28:59] the Persians and the Bible said that
[29:01] nothing could stand in front of him that
[29:04] that the RAM that would rise up would be
[29:07] strong until the goat rose up with a
[29:08] notable horn and when the goat would
[29:11] come him his feet wouldn't even be
[29:13] touching the ground he's coming with
[29:15] such a fury slams into the RAM and the
[29:18] RAM is defeated historians write about
[29:20] Alexander conquering the Persians they
[29:22] they even discuss in my new details the
[29:27] impossible odds that Alexander faces 30
[29:32] to 50 thousand men never had more than
[29:34] that miles and miles hundreds of miles
[29:36] away from home into the interior of the
[29:38] Persian Empire facing a million man
[29:40] standing army and the Persians are
[29:42] powerless to stop it not farmers
[29:44] professional soldiers who had crushed
[29:46] the Babylonians now can't beat an army
[29:49] of fifth of their size you think that's
[29:52] an accident and historians right Oh
[29:54] Alexander such a great military
[29:56] tactician
[29:56] oh it was was the Bible God had wrote
[30:01] that and Alexander with all of his
[30:03] strength would never be able to
[30:05] withstand the beast that that the
[30:07] Prophet couldn't even describe there was
[30:09] no I've never seen the beast like that
[30:10] you know the first ones like a bear and
[30:13] then there's like a lion there's like a
[30:14] ram there's a leopard and there's a goat
[30:16] and all these different things but now
[30:18] this this animal I can't quite it
[30:21] there's no equivalent he's just very
[30:22] fierce and very angry and he's got teeth
[30:25] like
[30:25] iron and he's very fierce and nurse
[30:27] anything like him and when he comes and
[30:29] he attacks the goat and he stomps the
[30:32] goat there's no with the goat that gets
[30:33] his horn broke he can't survive and
[30:36] that's the Roman Empire and the Bible
[30:38] the Bible tells about it all hundreds
[30:41] and hundreds and hundreds of years
[30:43] before it happened
[30:44] historians write it today no mention of
[30:46] prophecy no mention of God it's all
[30:48] about the military prowess of
[30:51] Nebuchadnezzar them in the military
[30:52] prowess of the Persians in the military
[30:54] prowess of Alexander the Great he was
[30:56] the great it was nothing but a drunk and
[31:00] died in it and there's early 30s I'm
[31:03] tasting friends God's prophecy is ruling
[31:07] the world do you realize that's why you
[31:10] are in control don't let the devil make
[31:13] you think he's in control you have the
[31:16] word in you and the word has already
[31:18] prophesied that there would be a bride
[31:20] standing at the last days and she would
[31:22] be undefeatable she would be an
[31:24] invincible army she could not be
[31:27] deceived she's predestinated not to fall
[31:29] hallelujah and they you know they they
[31:33] come down and they here comes here comes
[31:35] the first woe and I mean you know what
[31:39] God does God comes down on the scene and
[31:41] he comes with an angel said he ascended
[31:44] out of the East having the Living Seal
[31:46] having the seal of the Living God and he
[31:49] says to the Angels holding the four
[31:51] winds of war
[31:52] here's world war one wide open I mean
[31:56] you know armies are committed Kings
[31:58] czars you know here here's Kaiser
[32:01] Wilhelm with his plan here's the King of
[32:04] England with his plan the King of
[32:06] England here's the Czar of Russia here's
[32:08] all the Western powers and they got
[32:10] their armies and they got their plans
[32:11] and they got their maneuvers and they
[32:13] got this battle and we want this land
[32:14] and we're gonna conquer this and we're
[32:16] gonna have that and really divide it all
[32:17] up and God this comes up and says stop
[32:19] and everybody just stops and nobody even
[32:23] knows why
[32:23] oh the best laid plans of men the best
[32:28] laid plans of history to try to write
[32:30] history how they wanted I'm here to tell
[32:32] you God is writing history in the future
[32:35] and God has got a bride here today who
[32:38] believed his word and you are you are
[32:40] you're not just a human being who's been
[32:42] converted you're a human being with a
[32:44] divine nature on the inside and that
[32:47] divine nature is controlling history
[32:49] it's controlling your history there's
[32:51] nowhere you go and nothing you encounter
[32:54] that God is not in control of your life
[32:57] we ought to rejoice in that friends not
[33:01] to be such a that the bible says i saw
[33:04] another angel of sin doubt of from the
[33:06] east having the seal of the Living God
[33:08] and he cried with a loud voice to the
[33:11] four angels to whom it was given to hurt
[33:13] the earth and the sea it commands them
[33:16] you know hold up stop the fighting stop
[33:20] all the armies stop all the tanks I mean
[33:23] you're talking about armies you're
[33:27] talking about weapons of warfare that
[33:30] that I mean poisonous gas that burns the
[33:34] inside of the lungs of men and you you
[33:37] literally suffocate you can't get oxygen
[33:39] your mouth is wide open you're trying to
[33:41] breathe but your lungs are crisp inside
[33:44] and then and with power weapons of mass
[33:47] destruction you know the the the the
[33:51] allies they build these great forts and
[33:53] they build these trenches deep down into
[33:56] the ground cover with concrete and cover
[33:58] the concrete with earth and and the
[34:00] Germans just invent a 16-inch howitzer
[34:02] called Big Bertha that'll blow you up
[34:04] out of the ground I don't care how far
[34:06] down you are bro you up right in your
[34:08] bunk or blow you up right in your fort
[34:10] it doesn't matter
[34:11] we're talking about armies we're talking
[34:13] about mass destruction we're talking
[34:15] about chemical warfare and kings and
[34:18] kaisers and czars
[34:19] and presidents who are determined to to
[34:22] to say to have their say and the only
[34:25] one has is say is the mighty angel
[34:27] little sins out of these and says stop
[34:29] the whole thing because I got people
[34:31] here who need the seal of the Living God
[34:34] I'm here to tell you something friends
[34:36] don't ever underestimate the grace of
[34:38] God the grace of God has more power than
[34:40] armies it has more power than kaisers it
[34:42] has worked
[34:43] than czars and presidents and kings the
[34:46] grace of God is the all-powerful power
[34:50] God said I would be saved the devil
[34:54] can't stop it God said I'm going in a
[34:56] rapture the world can't block it
[34:58] hallelujah hallelujah friends I got a
[35:02] fallen nature on the outside but I got a
[35:04] stronger nature on the inside I got
[35:07] something in me that causes me to
[35:09] believe the word to the degree that I
[35:12] can't refuse it
[35:13] when God's word comes how many can can
[35:17] cannot relate to that today when I'm
[35:19] confronted by God's Word I just have to
[35:22] raise up my hands and say I surrender
[35:24] all Lord I I believe but help out my
[35:27] unbelief I want to be every bit of your
[35:29] word there's no resistance to the word
[35:32] and a child of God you know why that's
[35:37] true because grace is stronger than you
[35:41] grace is stronger than armies grace is
[35:44] stronger than kings grace is stronger
[35:47] than canons grace is stronger than
[35:49] nuclear bombs grace is stronger than the
[35:51] mark of the beast
[35:52] grace is stronger than false talk
[35:55] document teaching grace is stronger than
[35:57] the fallen nature of my flesh
[35:59] grace is stronger grace is stronger than
[36:02] me
[36:02] grace is stronger than the devil grace
[36:04] is stronger than you oh I just want to
[36:07] say today Lord give me thy amazing grace
[36:10] let your grace overshadow my whole life
[36:18] God was constantly bringing them in the
[36:22] situation after situation that they
[36:27] could not extricate themselves from
[36:31] getting that God does you that way but
[36:33] the Jason was talking about that this
[36:35] morning when trials and tribulations
[36:38] seemed to come wave after wave after
[36:40] wave he said that's not something is
[36:42] wrong that something is right there's
[36:45] something right going on because we're
[36:48] here to overcome we're here to press
[36:51] forward we need to learn friends we need
[36:54] to learn just that
[36:56] we do that it was the Lord just as they
[36:58] had to learn that it was the Lord who
[37:01] delivered them and it is the Lord who
[37:04] delivers us it is the the right hand the
[37:07] mighty arm of Jehovah how many have ever
[37:09] experienced that mighty arm of Jehovah
[37:12] you know you're in a situation you could
[37:15] stand up here in front of this church I
[37:16] guess every one of you could probably
[37:18] come up here and tell a story and say I
[37:19] faced an impossible situation and
[37:21] somehow God was my helper somehow it got
[37:24] turned around I how did it happen I
[37:26] don't even know fully how it happened
[37:28] all I know is I once was this and now
[37:30] I'm this I once had that problem now I
[37:32] don't have that problem
[37:33] here's a situation and it's just gone
[37:36] that's what that was what happened in
[37:38] that little wooden room when they went
[37:39] through there in the third Pole and they
[37:41] came out on the other side and missing
[37:43] limbs were restored and people were
[37:45] delivered and set free and healed and
[37:47] they said people on the in session what
[37:49] happened and they said I don't know I
[37:51] don't know I can't explain it I can't
[37:54] explain to you how that I can come into
[37:56] the presence of an invisible God and yet
[37:58] I can feel him more inside of me then I
[38:01] can feel anything on the outside I can
[38:03] have an effect in my life that's real
[38:05] and tangible and causes me to do things
[38:08] contrary to the fallen nature of my
[38:11] flesh on purpose I serve God on purpose
[38:19] I'm quite intentional I you know you
[38:24] know why because I'm gonna do what I
[38:26] want to do ain't nobody gonna stop me
[38:29] amen now since I know that I'm that way
[38:33] and all humans are that way what you've
[38:36] got to have happen is you've got to have
[38:38] that nature changed on the inside and
[38:39] then you know what you'll say right to
[38:42] the devil
[38:42] I'm gonna be a Christian I don't care
[38:45] what you say I'm gonna be a Christian I
[38:47] don't care what happens I'm gonna serve
[38:49] God say why are you gonna serve God look
[38:52] at all this trouble look at all these
[38:53] trials look at this heartache look at
[38:54] all this hardship
[38:55] why are you gonna serve God you know if
[38:57] he loved he would let that happen say
[38:58] I'm gonna serve God Satan in spite of
[39:01] all of those things I'm gonna prove to
[39:03] you that he's so much greater than you
[39:05] I'm gonna prove to the world that God is
[39:07] true and the devil is a liar
[39:10] oh I'm looking forward to the day
[39:14] friends when when the bride will be able
[39:18] to stand as a redeemed body on the
[39:21] throne that stretches the heavens wide
[39:23] and be able to stand and testify all you
[39:27] people who thought God was wrong guess
[39:29] what you were wrong all you people who
[39:31] thought he was false guess what he was
[39:33] true all you people who thought his word
[39:36] didn't matter well guess what it did by
[39:39] the way I don't matter oh it matters
[39:40] trust me
[39:42] the Word of God matters and the whole
[39:43] world will all of their lies and deceit
[39:46] and all other politics and all other
[39:48] nonsense and all their education and all
[39:50] their defiance and all their their
[39:51] ungodliness they're gonna find out one
[39:54] day that the word mattered a man it's
[39:58] interesting the word created the world
[40:00] they live on and they think it don't
[40:01] matter the word gave them the breath
[40:04] that's in their lungs and they think the
[40:05] word doesn't matter see so they had to
[40:09] learn it that it was Jehovah who would
[40:11] do it you see the land of the land of
[40:15] Canaan how would I describe it the land
[40:19] of Canaan was not it was not ever going
[40:23] to be theirs by conquest it was theirs
[40:27] by inheritance you understand it was
[40:32] already theirs by inheritance God had
[40:36] given it to him had promised Abraham and
[40:39] and and and and you know you get
[40:41] unbelievers rising up say all those poor
[40:43] those poor Canaanites you know those
[40:46] poor people there you know God went in
[40:48] and slaughtered them all out they had
[40:49] the opportunity to leave they knew the
[40:51] word to Abraham they knew the word the
[40:53] way wasn't no secret what the Jews were
[40:55] they're claiming this is our land and we
[40:58] were in captivity for four hundred years
[41:00] but you guys have to leave now because
[41:01] we're here and they wouldn't leave so
[41:03] they know what happened they perished
[41:05] they perished trying to resist the Word
[41:08] of God and why did God you know why
[41:11] would God take the land from them that
[41:13] they had settled because the Bible makes
[41:15] it clear because of their sin they were
[41:19] living in God's land sinfully listen
[41:23] friends
[41:24] whole world is doing that today they're
[41:26] living in God's earth sinfully and God
[41:29] is justified to let them be destroyed
[41:33] God is justified to give it to Israel
[41:35] and even warn Israel if you go in there
[41:38] sinning I'll take it from you too here
[41:42] to tell you something friends it was
[41:43] there's my inheritance but they still
[41:45] had to be sincere they still had to
[41:47] fight there still had to be conquest as
[41:49] brother Jason was teaching this morning
[41:51] that yes we're saved but God is all once
[41:54] you're saved God is pouring his energy
[41:56] into you because you're already perfect
[41:58] but you still have to be perfected see
[42:02] so we find then that there was a
[42:06] prophecy when God opened the Jordan he
[42:10] literally opened the door to the land
[42:13] that he had promised Abraham I'm gonna
[42:17] stop right there for today there's a lot
[42:19] more I could cover but it's a lesson and
[42:22] I want to stop give you some chance to
[42:24] digest what you've heard won't you stand

[44:13] talk about I want that in my life but I
[44:16] I can't as I stand here and live and
[44:19] breathe right now and I consider my
[44:21] heart not not my form of godliness but
[44:24] consider my heart when I look inward and
[44:27] I consider my heart and I know my heart
[44:31] and I'm not sure that that absolute
[44:34] perfect peace is there
[44:38] you want to raise your hand up to the
[44:40] Lord right now there's a few hands
[44:42] there's a few more god bless you
[44:44] brothers sisters young people teenagers
[44:47] husbands fathers all eyes closed now
[44:50] that's real honesty before God
[44:53] god bless you for that I'm gonna pray
[44:56] for you and I want you to believe what
[44:58] you've heard today I preach this word
[45:00] for a reason and we preach the word
[45:02] every time for a reason and that is that
[45:05] you'll believe it don't leave here
[45:08] wanting to believe it's true about you
[45:10] leave here today knowing that it's true
[45:13] you're gonna make up your mind right now
[45:15] and all those hands that went up say I
[45:17] am making up mine I heard the word today
[45:20] I heard the challenge the preacher put
[45:23] it out there and I am getting in line I
[45:26] want that in my life Lord and you're
[45:28] gonna say right now Lord Jesus today
[45:30] whatever area of shadow of doubt that
[45:34] was in my heart today
[45:35] I renounce it and I'm trusting in your
[45:38] word and I'm committing myself to you
[45:40] right now how many don't believe it that
[45:42] way let's pray Lord Jesus strangely
[45:47] moved Lord to to make this kind of a
[45:49] challenge in this kind of a call and I
[45:52] offer it now Lord and I hands went up
[45:54] and you saw it Lord it didn't it's not
[45:56] all that much value that I see the hands
[45:58] that went up but you saw them Lord all I
[46:01] do is stand here and acknowledge and
[46:03] thank the people but it's you Lord who
[46:05] sees the heart under that hand Lord you
[46:07] know that young man that young woman
[46:09] that older man older woman married man
[46:11] single man married woman single woman
[46:13] and Lord it was it was all over it was
[46:16] just a complete mixed bag of people that
[46:19] raised their hands I'm praying for them
[46:22] right now I pray Lord Jesus that this
[46:25] word that the urgency of the our Lord
[46:30] will become so real to us not just not
[46:34] just the people that raised their hand
[46:36] but all the people and not just all
[46:38] these people but me included Lord let
[46:41] the urgency of the hour consume our
[46:44] thinking let the urgency of the hour
[46:46] press upon us the need of greater
[46:49] sincere
[46:50] dedication before God to have our hearts
[46:54] because Lord that's what you're looking
[46:56] at I'm I'm grateful I'm so glad that
[47:01] you're not scoring me by the failures
[47:04] and the nature of my flesh I suppose if
[47:06] you would I'd pretty much be finished
[47:09] that's just honest confession Lord I'm
[47:11] sure probably a birth person in here
[47:13] would say Lord if you're gonna judge me
[47:15] by though by the failures from my fallen
[47:18] flesh when I'm just finished I might as
[47:19] well go home but Lord I have the promise
[47:22] in your word that I can give these
[47:23] people that's not what you're counting
[47:25] you're not scoring them that way you're
[47:28] looking at the heart the Holy Ghost was
[47:31] never just to be upon a person you had a
[47:34] desire from the old times of the Old
[47:36] Testament to be in them to live inside
[47:40] them to change their heart of stone into
[47:42] a heart of flesh give them a new nature
[47:45] which is a new creation in Christ Jesus
[47:48] grant that to them today Lord I offer
[47:51] this prayer as sincerely as I know how
[47:53] of course it'll take you I can't give it
[47:56] to him if I could I surely would all I
[47:58] could give them today was the word you
[48:00] gave me and you gave it to me and I've
[48:03] given it to them they have responded
[48:05] they've raised up their hands in
[48:07] sincerity Lord saw I just now give it to
[48:11] you in the lives of the young and older
[48:13] like male and female alike may you do a
[48:15] wonder work father in their lives may
[48:18] the fruit may there be a great harvest
[48:21] of fruit come from this service today
[48:23] and they'll say on that day when brother
[48:26] Jason was preaching the Ephesians
[48:28] parallel Joshua part 4 I wanted my part
[48:32] I wanted to be in that part I realized
[48:36] that what I'm reading in the Old
[48:38] Testament parallels my life and I want
[48:41] to be a partaker of this glorious
[48:43] promise may you grant it Lord I give it
[48:46] to you in Jesus wonderful name let's
