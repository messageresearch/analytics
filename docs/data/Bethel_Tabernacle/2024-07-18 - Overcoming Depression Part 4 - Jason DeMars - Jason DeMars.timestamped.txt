[46:15] from Minneapolis has gone to do missions
[46:17] there uh three or four times and uh has
[46:22] known brother Paco there for quite some
[46:25] time I think some of you you probably
[46:27] familiar with brother Paco but to me
[46:30] I've known him probably known of him for
[46:32] 20 years but um and his missions work
[46:37] and and how the Lord has used him but
[46:39] got the chance to finally meet him there
[46:42] it was a great blessing to me we um
[46:45] brother Matt and I as if you're young
[46:48] you probably could see that the first on
[46:50] the left the arrow um kuga that's where
[46:55] the airport is now the old dangerous
[46:58] airport in tuuku galpa is I think it's
[47:01] closed now so thank the lord we didn't
[47:04] have to go into that
[47:05] one um so we went and the other one just
[47:08] makes it a little further because the
[47:10] place we went to was like the third
[47:12] Arrow there called Tanga um our host was
[47:15] brother Eric you'll see a picture of him
[47:18] next he's the pastor in that City Tanga
[47:21] and then the youth meeting was up in the
[47:23] the northwest of there at kakamas
[47:27] just outside of there up the mountain a
[47:29] little
[47:30] bit and just getting in brother Eric
[47:33] picked us up he's got two boys pastoring
[47:37] the church
[47:39] there and brother Matt uh how the trip
[47:43] ended up going is other than the Youth
[47:46] Camp they split us up wherever we went
[47:48] so um brother Matt preached at two
[47:50] different churches on the first Sunday
[47:53] that we were there I guess the only
[47:55] Sunday that he was there and I I preach
[47:57] two services at one church with the
[48:01] pastor's brother Lucas
[48:04] cordona and um actually I don't remember
[48:07] what brother Matt ministered on but I
[48:09] ministered on the priesthood of all
[48:10] believers in the morning and the hidden
[48:13] uh the mystery of hidden wisdom from the
[48:16] seventh seal in the
[48:19] evening there and uh was good
[48:22] hard-hitting messages dealing with
[48:25] situations there
[48:27] um the pastor told me when I when after
[48:31] the first he said during the week he had
[48:34] been uh
[48:36] ministering on um the role of pastors
[48:40] and Ministry and missionary work and so
[48:43] the priesthood of all believers tied
[48:45] into that and and and family as well he
[48:48] was spoke about that and then in the
[48:50] evening speaking on the seventh seal he
[48:52] said he'd been speaking about that
[48:55] throughout the week so it was timely for
[48:58] them um Satur Sunday his brother Lucas
[49:03] the pastor in the middle and brother
[49:06] Noel interpreter brother Noel actually
[49:09] lived in the states for a number of
[49:11] years and his uh his sister and his
[49:16] nephew and niece actually go to brother
[49:18] Mike Wall's Church in Maryland so um he
[49:22] was very good interpreter brother Lucas
[49:26] his wife had a stroke um earlier this
[49:30] year and he just went in the room and
[49:32] she was laying there just totally to him
[49:36] it seemed like she was gone brought her
[49:37] to the
[49:39] hospital that there's nothing we can
[49:43] do said can you at least try to work on
[49:45] her they just left her in the bed to
[49:47] die so he went in he turned on brother
[49:50] brandom with a Spanish
[49:52] translation nothing so then he just
[49:54] turned on the
[49:55] English uh sermon and it was she opened
[49:58] her eyes right then soon as she heard
[50:00] the voice of the prophet and she's still
[50:05] in in rough rough shape um but she's
[50:08] there in the home and he's taking care
[50:10] of her to pray for him it's a it's a
[50:13] heavy burden to carry but he's doing his
[50:16] best to help her and and stand with
[50:21] her Matt they're praying for some that's
[50:25] at um
[50:27] Brick's church Sunday
[50:29] morning and this little girl is a quite
[50:32] a testimony um
[50:34] on
[50:37] Monday evening brother Eric said let's I
[50:41] was not feeling well enough to go but
[50:44] brother Matt went to the hospital she
[50:45] was suffering from dang
[50:47] fever quite dangerous
[50:50] and she had like rash all over her body
[50:53] and quite a high fever Matt prayed for
[50:55] her
[50:57] early evening they went out to eat came
[50:59] back brother Eric came to talk to us and
[51:02] said hey I'm going to go I'm going to go
[51:04] check on that little sister at the
[51:06] hospital to see how she's doing and he
[51:08] did and sent back pictures she's
[51:10] completely well no no rash no fever and
[51:15] then few days later we went over for her
[51:18] grandfather's birthday party and there
[51:20] she was and brother Matt was able to
[51:22] take a picture of her so thank the Lord
[51:23] for for his grace
[51:27] and uh I believe on Tuesday night we
[51:30] went to this little city called um
[51:33] singing frogs that's the
[51:35] translation there and uh it's always an
[51:39] adventure driving on the roads there
[51:42] every time I had my Apple watch on every
[51:44] time we went on those roads it'd be like
[51:47] 7 to 10 minutes of exercise that I got
[51:50] in being in the car because you got to
[51:53] like hold yourself forward and engage
[51:55] your core otherwise you'll be th you're
[51:56] thrown and thrashed
[51:58] everywhere so but we got there and it's
[52:02] a wonderful service the Lord moved
[52:04] supernaturally there at brother Beck and
[52:06] reyes's
[52:10] church the office there the pastor on
[52:12] the far right and then the the the young
[52:15] man between brother beckan and brother
[52:17] Matt is uh brother
[52:19] Noel's nephew that lives in um Maryland
[52:24] area trying to get him to come to Youth
[52:26] Camp this this
[52:27] fall be back in the state
[52:31] soon and um this is a incredible
[52:35] testimony I just this is It's amazing
[52:39] And I I guess I mean 75 years old one of
[52:43] the oldest one of the first message
[52:44] Believers in all of
[52:47] Honduras he has in his family I believe
[52:52] he has UH 60 grandchildren
[52:56] 12 children so he's got 70 he's almost
[52:59] caught up with
[53:00] Jacob so uh they wanted us to come over
[53:04] before we went to the youth meeting to
[53:06] pray pray over him and say a few words
[53:09] over him before the family at his
[53:11] birthday party so that was a great
[53:12] blessing for us to be able to to do
[53:19] that and uh met up there on the way uh
[53:23] to the youth meetings with brother Lise
[53:26] and his wife Sister Christine brother
[53:28] Luis is from if you don't know who he is
[53:30] he's from um goes to brother way Dale's
[53:33] Church there spoken word church and he's
[53:36] been a good friend of mine and brother
[53:38] Matt's for quite a while so it's a huge
[53:41] blessing for him to come he ended up
[53:43] translating most of our services there
[53:45] in uh at the youth
[53:50] meeting hey Josh you messing with me
[53:53] back there
[53:59] there we go all right Honduras is very
[54:02] beautiful country this is on one of the
[54:05] roads lots of lots of farmland and
[54:07] mountains and even Farmland on the
[54:10] mountains somehow they've learned how to
[54:13] I mean you'll see those they're just
[54:15] like up like that and they got corn and
[54:17] coffee growing on the side of the
[54:20] mountain uh this
[54:22] is a huge method of travel that you see
[54:25] I don't know how they stay in the back
[54:27] of the vehicles as they're going over
[54:29] those roads but somehow they
[54:34] do first morning of the Youth Camp there
[54:38] I think the number as they said there
[54:41] was about
[54:42] 250 people there in
[54:45] total had a tent set up this actually
[54:48] their one of the the church that's their
[54:51] probably 20 minutes drive out of the
[54:54] city there brother Eric had brought a
[54:57] vehicle that he had uh borrowed from a
[55:00] brother and we got there and we were
[55:02] getting ready to leave we couldn't leave
[55:04] because we had to find another ride
[55:06] because the vehicle was just a car and
[55:09] it wouldn't have made it over the river
[55:10] that you have to literally drive through
[55:12] so a brother in a in a in a four 4x4
[55:16] came and picked us up and we went
[55:18] through the river to get up to the to
[55:21] the
[55:24] meetings well brother Solomon Huffman
[55:27] from Brother joshh Bennett's church was
[55:29] there also and ministered at the youth
[55:31] meetings he was mostly traveling with
[55:33] brother Paco during the first part of
[55:36] the trip and we were with brother
[55:38] Eric brother Paco is the one right next
[55:41] to me between brother Matt and I in the
[55:44] middle is Brother Ali aasta he's the he
[55:48] was the person that was organizing the
[55:51] meeting and he's he's a he's a really a
[55:53] missionary an evangelist but he's
[55:56] overseeing pastoring that church there
[55:59] while they're while they're trying to
[56:01] find a permanent Pastor that's there
[56:04] outside of
[56:05] katakam this some uh finally got to eat
[56:11] um solid meal at Pizza
[56:16] Hut
[56:19] good ministered there um I think brother
[56:23] brother Matt ministered on the broken
[56:26] but not
[56:27] bitter um his evening service that he
[56:30] had he just had one service CU he left
[56:32] needed to leave on Saturday and I
[56:35] ministered on overcoming
[56:37] depression um and uh
[56:40] Freedom the youth and the teaching in
[56:42] the
[56:45] morning wonderful Services brother Matt
[56:48] just really knocked it out of the park
[56:50] in his his evening service you could see
[56:53] the Holy Spirit was really using him to
[56:55] bring a a Unity of amongst the ministers
[56:57] even just reminding them of what how
[57:00] glorious this message and how Vindicated
[57:02] and how true it is and it was it really
[57:05] brought a
[57:07] Revival brother Solomon ministered the
[57:10] Saturday night service and but a number
[57:12] came up for prayer there it was very uh
[57:16] simple but hard-handed
[57:22] message then the next day we sort of
[57:24] split split ways
[57:27] um brother Solomon and traded off
[57:30] brother Solomon went with brother Eric
[57:32] and I went with brother Paco and I
[57:34] ministered at the church that's in the
[57:35] city of kakamas the brother there on the
[57:39] left
[57:40] is brother nef Pastor there and he was I
[57:45] ministered on the seventh seal when I
[57:47] was there which was fascinating because
[57:50] he had been he had ministered on the six
[57:53] seals he'd finished that and he was of
[57:56] floundering he said cuz I wasn't sure
[57:58] how to really enter into the seventh
[58:01] seal it was it was the Sunday for me to
[58:03] preach on the seventh seal but the Lord
[58:07] just sent you to bring it clear for
[58:15] us well that is the end of the missions
[58:18] report it was a great blessing for me
[58:22] I'm going to be home for another um 12
[58:25] days and then I'm heading to Zombia so
[58:28] keep me in
[58:29] prayer um if you want to go ahead and
[58:33] stand we'll go to the
[58:38] word and we're going to read in um I
[58:42] think I'm going to finish up see how
[58:44] much time do I
[58:46] have just like brother Jason there's no
[58:49] telling what actually will happen My
[58:50] Hope Is that I will finish up my part
[58:53] four of overcoming depression but no
[58:56] promises can be made because who knows
[58:58] what happens Proverbs 12 verse
[59:07] 25 and I'm going to go ahead and read it
[59:10] from the new King James
[59:14] version anxiety in the heart of man
[59:17] causes
[59:18] depression but a good word makes it glad
[59:22] let's pray father we just want to commit
[59:24] this time of going to the word into to
[59:26] your hands Lord as we change the order
[59:29] from testifying to preaching Lord I pray
[59:31] that your Holy Spirit would come and
[59:33] anoint both speaker and
[59:35] hearer Lord speak into our hearts we ask
[59:38] tonight in Jesus name amen God bless you
[59:42] so just to lay before you what we spoke
[59:46] very very Bri briefly
[59:48] before um really the key is in
[59:51] Philippians chapter 4 we're looking at
[59:55] the scripture says
[59:56] don't uh do not be
[59:59] anxious be careful for nothing do not be
[1:00:02] anxious but in everything by prayer and
[1:00:06] supplication with Thanksgiving make your
[1:00:09] requests known to God
[1:00:12] then the the God of Peace will be with
[1:00:16] you then then the peace that passes all
[1:00:19] understanding will guard your hearts see
[1:00:22] it's a then we you know the B the the
[1:00:25] scripture says
[1:00:26] in uh the King James it says and but if
[1:00:28] you look closely it's saying then other
[1:00:31] words it's connected to what it said
[1:00:32] before we pray and we ask the Lord to
[1:00:34] give us peace we go to the minister cast
[1:00:37] off a spirit of depression wonderful God
[1:00:40] does that supernaturally however the
[1:00:43] problem with that is what ends up
[1:00:45] happening is you go out and you have the
[1:00:48] same mind that you had before and you
[1:00:52] then you're wearing those paths out back
[1:00:55] to the devil speaking to you and gaining
[1:00:58] control over your mind and that's the
[1:01:01] that's the danger in not having a
[1:01:04] renewing of our
[1:01:06] mind that's a that's a huge part of the
[1:01:09] Gospel of Jesus Christ is it's not
[1:01:12] merely a Deliverance but it's a
[1:01:14] strengthening to overcome and so when we
[1:01:18] if we want to overcome depression right
[1:01:21] depression is an end result as we saw
[1:01:24] from the scripture anxiety
[1:01:27] which comes from a fear right then the
[1:01:30] next step is
[1:01:32] depression right what's the step after
[1:01:34] depression a
[1:01:36] suicidal mind or
[1:01:38] spirit and so brother Brandon makes it
[1:01:40] clear it's it's a depression is a spirit
[1:01:43] anxiety even is a spirit it's like a
[1:01:46] dark Spirit hanging over a
[1:01:49] person and so it's a spiritual warfare
[1:01:52] that you're facing and ultimately it
[1:01:54] comes down to what are you going to
[1:01:55] believe believe are you going to believe
[1:01:57] the worry that the devil puts in your
[1:01:59] mind or are you going to believe the
[1:02:01] promise of God that's written in the
[1:02:03] scriptures and so when you're facing
[1:02:06] these B understand it's a battle when
[1:02:07] you're depressed you should go ding ding
[1:02:10] ding I'm in a
[1:02:12] battle not ding ding ding there's
[1:02:14] something wrong with me ding ding ding
[1:02:16] there's these are all the thoughts that
[1:02:18] the devil is planting and when you if
[1:02:20] it's brother Bram says how do we know if
[1:02:22] it's the devil or not if it's with the
[1:02:24] word it's from God if it's not if it's
[1:02:26] against the word it's obviously from the
[1:02:28] devil so
[1:02:31] worry based is based in fear
[1:02:36] so you're thinking about a
[1:02:39] situation and you're you're you you're
[1:02:41] putting
[1:02:43] your unbelief into
[1:02:46] operation about that situation right so
[1:02:50] God says don't do that
[1:02:52] instead
[1:02:54] pray make your make your requests known
[1:02:56] to God then give thanks that's speaking
[1:02:59] of worship get in his presence worship
[1:03:03] him then peace will come right and then
[1:03:07] he says finally brothers and he goes
[1:03:09] through the list he gives you a
[1:03:11] literally a bullet point not a literally
[1:03:13] bullet point but you know what I'm
[1:03:14] saying step by step here's what you
[1:03:17] should think about
[1:03:20] right and the God of Peace will be with
[1:03:22] you right so he's giving you the
[1:03:26] antidote the antidote isn't just stop
[1:03:29] worrying it's actually you have to be
[1:03:31] filled with something else you have to
[1:03:34] be filled with the word you have to be
[1:03:36] filled with the mind of
[1:03:39] Christ and
[1:03:41] so I want to I want to speak about five
[1:03:44] men of
[1:03:46] God who made a prayer request unto God
[1:03:51] concerning themselves all right what did
[1:03:55] they what was their prayer
[1:03:56] request they wanted
[1:03:59] death can you
[1:04:01] imagine job faced obviously impossible
[1:04:05] unexplained circumstances that
[1:04:07] produced such intense physical and
[1:04:11] mental suffering that he prayed that the
[1:04:12] day he was born had never come or if
[1:04:18] that if not that Lord would you would it
[1:04:20] also be okay if the day that that he
[1:04:23] would have died at Birth
[1:04:26] my goodness Moses faces a situation the
[1:04:30] children of Israel are complaining they
[1:04:33] want meat they're sick of Mana Moses is
[1:04:36] angry well God was angry
[1:04:39] too so Moses was disappointed in the
[1:04:43] children of Israel so he says God you
[1:04:45] put all this burden on me alone me
[1:04:49] alone and I can't bear
[1:04:51] it and if this is how it's going to be
[1:04:55] God just kill me out of
[1:04:58] hand Elijah he brings fire down from
[1:05:01] heaven killed the prophets of Baal asked
[1:05:04] God to bring rain he then ran
[1:05:07] supernaturally ran a
[1:05:09] marathon to
[1:05:12] jezrael then the messenger of Jezebel
[1:05:15] comes and says I'm going to make you
[1:05:18] like one of the prophets of baale I'm
[1:05:20] going to kill
[1:05:21] you next thing he Journeys 107 miles
[1:05:26] instead of facing
[1:05:27] it he runs to Beba 107 Mi South leaves
[1:05:34] his servant there and he says that's not
[1:05:35] far enough for
[1:05:37] me I'm going to go further I'm going to
[1:05:40] go into the neev to hide which if you've
[1:05:42] ever been to the neev it's a good place
[1:05:45] to hide that's where David went to hide
[1:05:47] from
[1:05:49] Saul and what was his prayer request
[1:05:52] dear God take my life away I'm not
[1:05:55] better than my
[1:05:59] father's Jonah went to
[1:06:01] Nineveh well not by his own
[1:06:05] choosing he went the other way but God
[1:06:08] said you don't have a choice in the
[1:06:09] matter Jonah you're going there
[1:06:13] anyhow he knew that the Assyrians would
[1:06:16] repent and he didn't want that to
[1:06:20] happen he he he in his prayer he says
[1:06:23] God I knew that that you're a merciful
[1:06:27] god forgiving the
[1:06:30] iniquity of those who
[1:06:34] repent so if this is how it's going to
[1:06:36] be kill
[1:06:39] me preaches a great Revival the whole
[1:06:42] city comes to the
[1:06:44] Altar for repentance they even bring
[1:06:46] their animals to repent I don't know why
[1:06:49] they needed to repent but apparently
[1:06:51] they thought they had to repent
[1:06:53] too and his result was because he was so
[1:06:56] angry he says I'm so angry I do well to
[1:06:59] be angry even to the point of
[1:07:02] death all right
[1:07:05] Jeremiah just came across my reading in
[1:07:08] my reading
[1:07:09] today Jeremiah 20
[1:07:14] ver7 Josh if you want to bring that up
[1:07:16] Jeremiah
[1:07:23] 20:7 oh Lord
[1:07:26] thou Hast deceived me and I was deceived
[1:07:29] that's a little bit of a tricky uh thing
[1:07:33] there because God God is not a liar God
[1:07:36] doesn't deceive anyone uh the the sense
[1:07:39] that Jeremiah is making here is God you
[1:07:42] you brought me here uh to preach to
[1:07:46] these
[1:07:48] people and uh I think that's a different
[1:07:53] translation of the Bible you want to
[1:07:54] switch back to the
[1:07:56] jjv
[1:07:59] um so the sense is you you called me to
[1:08:02] do this you called me to preach and now
[1:08:06] the result is I'm in the
[1:08:09] stocks so it's like you you you laid
[1:08:12] your hand on me and and now they laid
[1:08:16] they laid their hand on
[1:08:18] me you're stronger than I and have
[1:08:21] prevailed I'm in derision daily everyone
[1:08:24] mocks me
[1:08:27] verse 8 for since I spake I cried out I
[1:08:29] cried violence and spoil because the
[1:08:32] word of the Lord was made a reproach
[1:08:33] unto me and a derision
[1:08:36] daily then I said I'll not make mention
[1:08:39] of him nor speak anymore in his
[1:08:42] name but his word was in Mine Heart as a
[1:08:45] burning fire shut up in my bones and I
[1:08:47] was weary with forbearing and I could
[1:08:50] not stay so here Jer Jeremiah says I'm
[1:08:53] I'm not I'm not preaching anymore I
[1:08:56] quit and God lays his hand upon
[1:09:00] Jeremiah with the word of the Lord and
[1:09:02] Jeremiah says I okay I can't I can't I
[1:09:05] can't resist God he's forcing me to do
[1:09:08] it
[1:09:10] now verse 10 for I heard the defaming of
[1:09:12] many fear on every side report say they
[1:09:15] and we will report all my familiars
[1:09:18] watch for my halting saying per
[1:09:19] Adventure he'll be enticed and we shall
[1:09:21] Prevail against him and we shall take
[1:09:23] our revenge on him
[1:09:25] but the Lord is with me as a mighty
[1:09:27] terrible one therefore my persecutors
[1:09:30] shall stumble and they shall not Prevail
[1:09:31] they shall be greatly ashamed for they
[1:09:33] shall not Prosper their Everlasting
[1:09:35] confusion shall never be
[1:09:39] forgotten I want to skip up to
[1:09:42] 14 cursed be the day wherein I was born
[1:09:46] let not the day wherein my mother bear
[1:09:48] me be blessed cursed be the man who
[1:09:51] brought Tidings to my father saying a
[1:09:52] man child is born unto thee making him
[1:09:55] very glad and let that man be as the
[1:09:58] cities which the Lord overthrew and
[1:10:00] repented not and let him hear the cry in
[1:10:02] the mourning and the shouting at noon
[1:10:04] time because he slew me not from the
[1:10:06] womb or that my mother have been my my
[1:10:09] grave and her womb to be always great
[1:10:12] with me wherefore came I forth out of
[1:10:14] the womb to see labor and sorrow that my
[1:10:17] days should be
[1:10:18] consumed with
[1:10:20] shame my
[1:10:23] goodness that's depression
[1:10:26] that's
[1:10:27] sorrow brother brandham in the sermon
[1:10:30] you can take that down brother Josh
[1:10:32] brother brandham in the sermon adoption
[1:10:34] number
[1:10:36] three oh I love that
[1:10:39] sound yesterday he said people don't
[1:10:43] know what depressing times come with
[1:10:45] this type of ministry I got real
[1:10:47] depressed and I said to the wife I wish
[1:10:49] I could just go on she said why you say
[1:10:52] that bill I said oh here I have troubles
[1:10:56] and things and then seemed like the holy
[1:10:59] spirit said are you trying to bypass
[1:11:01] them are you trying to dodge them see no
[1:11:06] I said just let me stand right up in the
[1:11:09] face of it all and face it out
[1:11:13] Hallelujah all right now that's the way
[1:11:17] to face your troubles that's the way to
[1:11:20] face your problems I'm going to stand up
[1:11:23] and face it head on like a man
[1:11:26] now I want to point out each of these
[1:11:29] instances of men of God having anxiety
[1:11:32] that led them to be depressed and have
[1:11:35] Suicidal
[1:11:36] Thoughts started with the wrong way of
[1:11:39] thinking about the situation that they
[1:11:40] were
[1:11:43] in God comes to job and says who is this
[1:11:45] that darkens counsel by words without
[1:11:49] knowledge in other words God tells job
[1:11:51] you're thinking wrong about the
[1:11:53] situation now God didn't Blas he didn't
[1:11:55] blaspheme he said the lord gave the Lord
[1:11:57] taken away blessed be the name of the
[1:11:59] Lord but then his friends came and said
[1:12:01] hey this is because you're a secret
[1:12:03] sinner now the question changed and job
[1:12:06] is confused and he starts uttering all
[1:12:10] kinds of things about I wish I was dead
[1:12:12] I wish this I wish that and God says you
[1:12:15] you don't even know what's going on what
[1:12:19] you why are you trying to figure it out
[1:12:21] when you have no
[1:12:23] idea all right
[1:12:26] Moses thought wrongly about the
[1:12:28] situation he was
[1:12:29] in instead of praying and asking God
[1:12:32] what to do he got angry said you put
[1:12:34] this burden on me alone says me alone
[1:12:39] God didn't put that burden on him
[1:12:41] alone Mo Moses was just a voice that God
[1:12:46] used and God was there the whole time
[1:12:48] doing every single
[1:12:52] thing God LED God provided God did the
[1:12:55] miraculous God
[1:12:57] protected Moses merely needed to trust
[1:13:00] God through this situation instead he
[1:13:03] put it upon himself and ended up asking
[1:13:06] for death Elijah instead of standing by
[1:13:10] faith and asking God def to defend him
[1:13:13] ran away like a
[1:13:16] coward he ended up out in the wilderness
[1:13:18] alone saying God please kill me walking
[1:13:22] by fear instead of walking by faith
[1:13:27] Jonah had the wrong thinking about God's
[1:13:30] heart for Gentiles and it led him to a
[1:13:33] hatred for them and not wanting them to
[1:13:36] be delivered he was more concerned about
[1:13:39] vegetables than he was about
[1:13:43] people and this led him down a
[1:13:46] path of anger despair
[1:13:50] depression every one of those
[1:13:53] circumstances led to a response that was
[1:13:56] not rooted in
[1:13:58] faith it was rooted in fear they
[1:14:01] thinking about the
[1:14:03] situation was wrong and then it led them
[1:14:07] down the wrong path of thinking anxiety
[1:14:10] depression and dark
[1:14:14] thoughts I want to point out that the
[1:14:16] world tries to give a remedy remedy to a
[1:14:21] problem that's rooted in
[1:14:24] unbelief and lack of
[1:14:26] faith now also want to point out how did
[1:14:31] God approach his servants in every
[1:14:33] situation in all but one of them which
[1:14:37] was Jonah God provided corre
[1:14:41] Comfort right what did he do to Moses
[1:14:44] Moses you're alone here's 70 brothers
[1:14:46] that will stand with
[1:14:48] you Elijah I'm going to send my softest
[1:14:51] handed Angel to touch you and give you
[1:14:54] some something to
[1:14:57] eat
[1:14:59] right job God himself
[1:15:02] came that was the
[1:15:07] Comfort just said dinosaurs and you seen
[1:15:12] them
[1:15:13] um see you seen them dragons see those
[1:15:18] yeah can can you can you hunt them
[1:15:21] easily can you invite them to a
[1:15:23] banquet no but I can control all of them
[1:15:27] I'm your comfort
[1:15:30] job see and then and then we find
[1:15:33] brother Branham the Holy Ghost came to
[1:15:35] him and spoke to his heart and said
[1:15:37] stand and face it don't run from your
[1:15:42] troubles Jonah just had he got
[1:15:46] correction right Jeremiah the Lord was
[1:15:50] with him and comforted him delivered him
[1:15:51] from the stocks
[1:15:55] now the
[1:15:57] world will offer you a thousand excuses
[1:16:00] for your
[1:16:03] behavior it it'll offer you a thousand
[1:16:07] reasons they're all the wrong
[1:16:10] reasons they're all the wrong
[1:16:13] approaches they're all they're they're
[1:16:15] all bringing the wrong direction because
[1:16:17] it starts from the wrong foundation so
[1:16:20] we talked about before about
[1:16:22] psychology Psychotherapy Psych Tropic
[1:16:25] drugs all of that doesn't bring a
[1:16:28] long-term
[1:16:29] solution e even if you really understand
[1:16:33] many of the quote unquote mental
[1:16:35] illnesses that they call today are just
[1:16:37] a figment of people's imagination
[1:16:39] they're created by a medical society
[1:16:42] that's corrupted and under the control
[1:16:44] of the
[1:16:47] devil and the purpose of it is to is a
[1:16:51] satanic plot to keep people as perpetual
[1:16:59] victims the world does not have a real
[1:17:02] remedy they might have a
[1:17:05] Band-Aid that could work temporarily but
[1:17:07] the real remedy is offered to us in the
[1:17:10] word of God God's armor is all
[1:17:14] Supernatural and how is it
[1:17:16] operated by
[1:17:19] reasoning by
[1:17:21] education by intellect by faith
[1:17:25] every one of his pieces of armor is
[1:17:29] operated by faith faith comes from the
[1:17:32] gene of God in the human
[1:17:35] soul but we know that Faith also
[1:17:37] operates through channels five channels
[1:17:40] of the spirit memory conscience reason
[1:17:42] imagination affections if any of these
[1:17:45] channels are clogged they will hinder
[1:17:48] Faith from operating in our lives the
[1:17:51] message of the hour came to blow out all
[1:17:53] those channels
[1:17:55] GL by the power of the Holy Ghost from
[1:17:58] the soul not an anointing on the
[1:18:00] channels but a transformed nature in the
[1:18:04] soul that's changed from the inside out
[1:18:07] there's a cleansing just like that oil
[1:18:09] comes from the inside of the dove to the
[1:18:11] outside it's it it cleanses everything
[1:18:14] in its path so that the outside is then
[1:18:17] clean it's what Jesus said you have to
[1:18:19] make first the inside of the cup clean
[1:18:22] and then the outside will follow if you
[1:18:23] try to just make the out side clean
[1:18:26] you'll be end up with dirty a filthy cup
[1:18:30] anyways all right the world wants to
[1:18:34] give a remedy dealing only with the
[1:18:37] channels right they're just going to
[1:18:40] they're just going to poke their hands
[1:18:42] into the mental channels of the spirit
[1:18:46] they're going to say if we fix this if
[1:18:47] we fix this well this happened because
[1:18:50] of your memory of your dad this happened
[1:18:53] because of this well talk about that
[1:18:55] more Lord
[1:18:59] willing God has a supernatural ability
[1:19:02] to operate by the holy spirit in the
[1:19:05] soul to change our nature it's called
[1:19:09] sanctification it's called The Washing
[1:19:11] of Water by the word it's called the
[1:19:14] renewing of our
[1:19:16] mind again not an external Force an
[1:19:20] internal Supernatural force that cleans
[1:19:24] es all those
[1:19:26] channels from sin and evil all right now
[1:19:31] we mentioned trauma past
[1:19:35] history those things and brother Brandon
[1:19:38] points this out those things can be
[1:19:41] instructive as to why you're facing
[1:19:43] trouble today the pro the the issue can
[1:19:46] become this is that you assign
[1:19:50] accountability and blame for your
[1:19:53] actions but notice the Bible never lets
[1:19:56] you do
[1:19:59] that Ezekiel 18
[1:20:05] 1-4 the word of the Lord came unto me
[1:20:07] again saying what mean ye that you use
[1:20:10] this proverb concerning the land of
[1:20:11] Israel saying the fathers have eaten
[1:20:13] sour grapes and the children's teeth are
[1:20:16] set on edge as I live saith the Lord God
[1:20:19] you shall not have occasion anymore to
[1:20:21] use this proverb in Israel behold all
[1:20:24] souls are mine as the soul of the father
[1:20:26] so also the soul of the son is mine the
[1:20:29] soul that sinth it shall die we're all
[1:20:33] held accountable for our own actions our
[1:20:35] own reactions our own responses our own
[1:20:38] attitudes and everything we
[1:20:42] do at at at if you make it to the day of
[1:20:45] the Judgment you're not going to be
[1:20:48] asked I say you make it into the day of
[1:20:50] the Judgment because the bride is
[1:20:52] already judged and delivered that but if
[1:20:54] one were to make it to the day the white
[1:20:57] Throne
[1:20:59] judgment it's going to the Lord's not
[1:21:01] going to say did your father make you do
[1:21:04] that did your mother's mistreatment of
[1:21:07] you force you to
[1:21:09] sin and again I those things can explain
[1:21:12] a disposition you have it is not an
[1:21:15] excuse to continue walking in sin it's
[1:21:19] not an excuse to continue walking in
[1:21:22] evil god holds us personally accountable
[1:21:27] if we're disobedient to his word
[1:21:29] regardless of what happened in the
[1:21:32] past God does not allow excuses we love
[1:21:38] excuses I I I I thank God for my brother
[1:21:41] he was my basketball
[1:21:43] coach and he trained me because I made
[1:21:47] an I I messed up in practice I made an
[1:21:49] excuse and he was so angry with me he
[1:21:51] drove me home after practice don't you
[1:21:53] ever make an excuse again for what you
[1:21:56] did own
[1:21:59] it and if if you if you feel you need to
[1:22:02] apologize you own it and you apologize
[1:22:04] for it don't sit here oh well I did this
[1:22:06] because that's just you're being weak
[1:22:09] don't do
[1:22:12] that and that's the
[1:22:15] truth we are in charge of our own
[1:22:21] behavior we're not victims
[1:22:24] you're just a victim of circumstances
[1:22:27] how about you sayi an
[1:22:29] overcomer the word of God gives me an
[1:22:32] escape is that isn't that what the Bible
[1:22:34] says 1 Corinthians
[1:22:35] 10 verse 12 wherefore let him that
[1:22:38] thinketh he standeth take heed lesty
[1:22:40] fall there is no temptation taken you
[1:22:43] but such as is common to man but God is
[1:22:45] faithful who will not suffer you to be
[1:22:47] tempted above that you're are able but
[1:22:49] will with the Temptation also make a way
[1:22:51] of es way to escape that you may be able
[1:22:54] to to Bear it so Temptations come Trials
[1:22:59] Come difficulties come bruises come
[1:23:03] trauma comes God makes a way for you to
[1:23:06] escape it he doesn't want you living as
[1:23:10] a victim of your circumstances the Holy
[1:23:14] Ghost is given unto you to become an
[1:23:17] overcomer I was abused I was mistreated
[1:23:21] I anything any of the worst things you
[1:23:24] can imagine imagine there is power in
[1:23:26] the Holy Ghost to be delivered and set
[1:23:29] free and to walk as an overcomer not as
[1:23:31] a victim and the Very traumas that you
[1:23:34] had God actually if you can receive it
[1:23:37] tonight the holy spirit's telling you
[1:23:40] this God is going to use your trauma
[1:23:43] he's going to heal it and you then will
[1:23:46] be a means of bringing healing to
[1:23:47] someone that's gone through the same
[1:23:49] thing that you went through many times
[1:23:52] you see this you see this in the
[1:23:53] ministry
[1:23:55] of uh over in Egypt the woman who was a
[1:23:58] a
[1:24:00] uh uh she went there as a
[1:24:02] missionary uh and I went to the I went
[1:24:05] to the
[1:24:06] um uh orphanage Lilian Trasher what did
[1:24:11] she do she brought in these w women who
[1:24:13] were
[1:24:14] victims and what did what did God use
[1:24:16] these women who are victims to do he
[1:24:19] used them to minister to other women
[1:24:21] that were victims God didn't say oh your
[1:24:24] victim victims it's I'm so I'm so sorry
[1:24:27] just sit over there and cry and then
[1:24:29] control everybody with your
[1:24:32] emotions I'm sorry but that's many times
[1:24:35] what
[1:24:36] happens God doesn't sit you doesn't
[1:24:39] bring you to Christ give you the Holy
[1:24:42] Ghost to sit and suck your thumb he's
[1:24:45] brought you to Min to minister in the
[1:24:48] things that you are broken in to help
[1:24:51] heal other people
[1:24:56] 2 Corinthians 1 8-11 for we would not
[1:24:59] Brethren have you ignorant of our
[1:25:01] trouble which came to us in Asia we are
[1:25:03] pressed out of measure above strength in
[1:25:06] so much that we despaired even of life
[1:25:09] but we had the sentence of death in
[1:25:11] ourselves that we should not trust in
[1:25:13] ourselves but in God which raises the
[1:25:16] Dead who delivered us from so great a
[1:25:18] death and doth deliver in whom we trust
[1:25:20] that he will yet Deliver Us you also
[1:25:22] helping together by prayer for us us
[1:25:25] that the for the gift bestowed upon us
[1:25:26] by the means of many persons thanks may
[1:25:28] be given by many on our behalf doesn't
[1:25:31] sound like much of a victim sounds like
[1:25:34] someone who went through a horrible
[1:25:35] thing and comes out as walking in
[1:25:38] Victory because he learned I can't trust
[1:25:41] in myself I'm trusting in The God Who
[1:25:44] raises the dead now if God can raise the
[1:25:47] dead can he heal a rape
[1:25:51] victim if God can raise the Dead can he
[1:25:54] heal an abuse victim and raise them up
[1:25:57] to health so that they can be a means of
[1:26:00] Deliverance for others that's what my
[1:26:02] Jesus
[1:26:05] does don't
[1:26:07] walk in the victim mentality God always
[1:26:11] provides a means of Deliverance a means
[1:26:13] of escape a remedy for pain for trauma
[1:26:16] for sorrow for ways of thinking that are
[1:26:18] contrary to the word look at what Jesus
[1:26:22] read in the synagogue
[1:26:26] Isaiah 61 1-3 Spirit of the Lord God is
[1:26:29] upon me because the Lord has anointed me
[1:26:31] to preach good tinings unto the meek he
[1:26:33] sent me to bind up the Brokenhearted to
[1:26:35] Proclaim Liberty to the captives and the
[1:26:37] opening of the prison to them that are
[1:26:39] bound and we'll skip to verse three to
[1:26:42] appoint unto them that mourn in Zion to
[1:26:45] give unto them Beauty for Ashes the oil
[1:26:47] of joy for mourning the Garment of
[1:26:49] Praise for the spirit of heaviness that
[1:26:50] they may be called Trees of
[1:26:52] Righteousness the planting of the Lord
[1:26:54] that he might be glorified I want I want
[1:26:56] to say to you tonight
[1:27:00] this Jesus the Same anointing that Came
[1:27:05] Upon Jesus to do these things is the
[1:27:07] same anointing that comes on
[1:27:10] You by the baptism of the Holy Ghost to
[1:27:13] be this to
[1:27:15] others and so you might have been you
[1:27:17] might have been a victim of any of these
[1:27:19] things you might have been suffering
[1:27:21] depression but he gives you the oil of
[1:27:23] joy
[1:27:24] for
[1:27:26] that you might have been suffering from
[1:27:29] the spirit of heaviness but he gives you
[1:27:30] the Garment of Praise for
[1:27:34] that he wants to be glorified in the
[1:27:37] planting that he's doing in your
[1:27:42] life
[1:27:44] Jesus the things the griefs that you had
[1:27:48] the sorrow that you had Jesus bore it on
[1:27:52] the
[1:27:53] cross at
[1:27:55] Calvary surely he's borne our griefs and
[1:27:58] carried our sorrows yet we did we esteem
[1:28:01] him
[1:28:03] smiing stricken smiing that's a new word
[1:28:07] write that down brother
[1:28:11] Jason that's real bad smiing is real
[1:28:16] bad stricken smitten of God and
[1:28:21] Afflicted God laid
[1:28:24] our trials our difficulties our pain our
[1:28:28] trauma our depression our sorrow our
[1:28:31] sadness all on Christ the price has been
[1:28:35] paid you can go free
[1:28:37] tonight you don't have to stay in
[1:28:39] bondage to
[1:28:41] it it's not through Psychotherapy
[1:28:44] psychotropic drugs that we receive
[1:28:48] Deliverance these are poor replacements
[1:28:51] for the power of the gospel and the
[1:28:52] Deliverance that comes to us
[1:28:54] through the
[1:28:58] supernatural if we follow if we really
[1:29:01] and truly follow God's word and use what
[1:29:03] he's provided Us in this world we don't
[1:29:05] need we don't need to be stay in the
[1:29:09] victim mentality that psych
[1:29:11] Psychotherapy is going to give to
[1:29:13] you that's all that nonsense is based on
[1:29:17] atheism
[1:29:18] Marxism it's a deception it's it's based
[1:29:22] on evolution
[1:29:27] short term it might
[1:29:28] help it's not permanent healing it's not
[1:29:33] permanent deliverance and the fact is
[1:29:35] the way the very nature of how
[1:29:37] psychology approaches problems brings en
[1:29:42] enlivens
[1:29:44] strengthens continues the problems
[1:29:48] themselves any thinking contrary to
[1:29:51] God's word actually we have to take take
[1:29:54] and kill
[1:29:56] it we have to take every thought isn't
[1:30:00] that what Paul said take every thought
[1:30:03] captive to The Obedience of
[1:30:06] Christ casting down high things in every
[1:30:09] imagination that exalts itself against
[1:30:11] the knowledge of
[1:30:14] Christ again we talked about
[1:30:17] before biblical counseling is very
[1:30:20] different than a a uh psychology session
[1:30:26] biblical counseling is placing the word
[1:30:28] in individually it's just what we're
[1:30:30] doing with preaching we're placing the
[1:30:32] word in brother Bram said that's what
[1:30:34] preaching does is to change your mind
[1:30:37] even says pervert your mind from the
[1:30:39] things of the world to the things of the
[1:30:42] word right and so that's what Biblical
[1:30:46] counseling is from a pastor from a
[1:30:49] minister is laying in the word in an
[1:30:52] individual or in a couple basis so
[1:30:55] certainly is needed friendship is needed
[1:30:58] talking through things sometimes is
[1:31:01] needed sometimes it's not
[1:31:03] needed but a re a real friend a real
[1:31:07] spouse that loves you sometimes that's
[1:31:09] better than
[1:31:11] anything they know you in and out and
[1:31:14] they can help correct
[1:31:16] you that's really what we need many
[1:31:19] times is we we we we think we just need
[1:31:22] someone to Pat and baby us and maybe
[1:31:24] that's good a little bit I think you see
[1:31:26] God does Pets the men of God that were
[1:31:30] struggling to give them Comfort but more
[1:31:32] more so I think we're called a little
[1:31:34] bit higher than Jeremiah than job then
[1:31:41] Elijah right we are the person that's
[1:31:45] the least in the Kingdom of Heaven is
[1:31:48] greater than John the Baptist so John
[1:31:49] the Baptist was the greatest of all the
[1:31:52] prophets so we're not not called to lay
[1:31:55] in the stocks and say God take my life
[1:31:59] we're called to lay in the stocks and
[1:32:02] say thank you Lord You're the great
[1:32:04] deliverer I'm not looking at my
[1:32:07] circumstances I'm not looking looking at
[1:32:09] the situation that I'm facing I'm
[1:32:11] looking to you and to your
[1:32:14] promises
[1:32:16] secondarily
[1:32:17] sometimes when we say we need to talk to
[1:32:19] people or go to a psychologist we're
[1:32:22] actually breaking the word because what
[1:32:24] we actually do is we go tell on
[1:32:26] something that somebody else did to hurt
[1:32:28] us and that's bypassing the scripture
[1:32:31] which says if your brother sins against
[1:32:32] you go to him
[1:32:34] directly and we bypass that and what do
[1:32:37] we do we create a psychological problem
[1:32:39] for ourselves that wasn't even necessary
[1:32:42] you create a complex upon a complex when
[1:32:45] if you just did what Jesus said moreover
[1:32:47] If thy brother trespass against thee go
[1:32:49] and tell him his fault between thee and
[1:32:51] him alone if he shall hear thee thou has
[1:32:53] gain the my brother 99% of the time it's
[1:32:56] just a misunderstanding and you just
[1:32:59] resolved it and no there doesn't even
[1:33:00] need to be repentance maybe just from
[1:33:02] you for
[1:33:04] misunderstanding 99% of the time that
[1:33:07] solves the problem one% of the time you
[1:33:10] have a stubborn Sinner and you got to go
[1:33:12] fetch the
[1:33:16] pastor might it not even be that much my
[1:33:20] experience it's always a
[1:33:22] misunderstanding oh I didn't understand
[1:33:24] that I thought you were saying this and
[1:33:25] you said this and it's resolved or we
[1:33:28] could just go to someone else did you
[1:33:30] know this person said this oh yeah uh
[1:33:33] they're always doing stuff like that man
[1:33:35] they just drive me crazy and now you
[1:33:37] have a whole complex about a person and
[1:33:39] you didn't even understand the situation
[1:33:41] correctly and now you got to go see a
[1:33:43] psychologist because you're so messed
[1:33:50] up really it I mean these things it's
[1:33:53] funny but these things happen people go
[1:33:55] into depression they run from church
[1:33:58] they run they they run from situation
[1:34:01] they've never resolved anything in their
[1:34:03] life so they're just
[1:34:07] Runners and then it's somebody else's
[1:34:09] fault of
[1:34:12] course they never squarely realize that
[1:34:15] the finger Point's right back at
[1:34:17] them I'm just repeating the same problem
[1:34:19] and God graciously is giving you the
[1:34:21] same problem over and over again so that
[1:34:24] you can get it
[1:34:27] right because he loves you see if he
[1:34:29] didn't love you he'd just say go
[1:34:33] on because he loves you he says hey
[1:34:37] you're going to have to face this
[1:34:39] pal the problem is looking at you in the
[1:34:44] mirror be a real Christian and deal with
[1:34:47] it deal with your issues I think that's
[1:34:50] really if I can kind of bring it to a
[1:34:53] summation is we all have struggles we
[1:34:56] all
[1:34:57] have battles that we face in our mind
[1:35:01] but the the the thing is we have to
[1:35:03] actually face the
[1:35:05] problems the problem is when we run from
[1:35:08] the problems or try to push the problem
[1:35:10] onto something else someone
[1:35:12] else are you perfect you're sinless you
[1:35:16] have never made a mistake
[1:35:18] before Oh God bless you but if you're
[1:35:22] like me and all the other rest of the
[1:35:24] people in the
[1:35:26] church you make mistakes you're full of
[1:35:29] mistakes and you've have situations that
[1:35:32] you've refused to face the problem you
[1:35:34] refuse to face the
[1:35:37] fear I think um brother I heard brother
[1:35:41] Eugene preaching the other day and he
[1:35:42] said if fear comes
[1:35:45] up that's an indicator of that's the
[1:35:47] thing that you have to
[1:35:50] face so if there's a fear in your life
[1:35:53] go deal with it face it because you'll
[1:35:57] never be an overcomer until you face
[1:35:58] your fear and it doesn't become your
[1:36:00] fear
[1:36:06] anymore God doesn't want us
[1:36:10] depressed God doesn't want us walking in
[1:36:13] worry and fear and anxiety and again
[1:36:17] we've this this comes down to you if if
[1:36:20] you're walking in that what it comes
[1:36:23] down to if you're really a holy ghost
[1:36:25] filled Christian you have trained
[1:36:27] yourself to think that way you could say
[1:36:30] well I'm just I'm a nervous person that
[1:36:34] you're training
[1:36:35] yourself you have accepted a malady upon
[1:36:38] yourself that the word of God doesn't
[1:36:40] declare over you the word says that
[1:36:44] you're to have
[1:36:45] peace right so if you do what the word
[1:36:49] says peace will
[1:36:51] follow if you do Paul Paul even goes as
[1:36:54] far as to say that which you have heard
[1:36:58] from me what you've seen in me that do
[1:37:02] then the God of Peace will be with you
[1:37:05] so I would take that present tense is
[1:37:09] the things that you have seen in as an
[1:37:12] example in the life of brother
[1:37:13] brandham things that you've heard him
[1:37:16] preach do then the God of Peace will be
[1:37:20] with you the problem is we lack peace
[1:37:21] because we're not doing the word we're
[1:37:23] doing it our
[1:37:25] way and we're say oh God give me peace I
[1:37:27] need peace and God's saying are you the
[1:37:31] words right there in front of you to
[1:37:33] live of giving the Holy Spirit to
[1:37:36] empower you to do it you're not a victim
[1:37:39] you can overcome that musicians if you'd
[1:37:41] come you're not subject to
[1:37:44] that so these are the these are the
[1:37:46] things the enemy will come with fear for
[1:37:50] sure every time I preach this the enemy
[1:37:52] comes at me hard
[1:37:54] and I I'll slip down the path if I'm not
[1:37:57] if I don't fight the more I preach it
[1:37:58] the more I
[1:38:01] fight but you ha you have
[1:38:04] to being Godly there's a training that
[1:38:07] goes along with it a training in the
[1:38:10] word it's time for you to pick up the
[1:38:12] sword and fight it's time for you to say
[1:38:15] I'm I'm going to walk in Victory with
[1:38:18] the sword of the Lord I'm going to take
[1:38:20] that I'm not only going to speak it but
[1:38:21] I'm going to be a doer of the word I'm
[1:38:23] going to live the word and then peace is
[1:38:26] going to follow in my
[1:38:30] life with your own
[1:38:33] thought don't be obsessed with how you
[1:38:36] think about situations every situation
[1:38:39] take it back to the word what does the
[1:38:40] word say what does faith say about this
[1:38:43] circumstance and this
[1:38:45] situation you become obsessed with oh I
[1:38:49] have to take a mental health day
[1:38:52] today really
[1:38:55] are we that
[1:38:57] babied Christians of old were
[1:39:01] rugged when brother bandham says that I
[1:39:03] don't hear Christians of old were rugged
[1:39:05] y'all a bunch of soft soap babies I I
[1:39:07] hear God's calling me to be rugged right
[1:39:10] God's calling me to be tough he's not
[1:39:13] calling me to have a thin skin and
[1:39:15] everything that everybody does offends
[1:39:16] me thicken up your skin get tough and go
[1:39:21] in the word of God
[1:39:24] and if the Devil comes and says you know
[1:39:25] that person meant this say shut up devil
[1:39:28] I don't accept that way line of thinking
[1:39:30] about other people I don't accept the
[1:39:33] line of thinking about how I feel at any
[1:39:36] given moment I'm accepting the word and
[1:39:39] my feelings have to conform to the
[1:39:43] word if you want to overcome depression
[1:39:46] what what do I say to you conform your
[1:39:49] thoughts to the
[1:39:50] word how do you conform your thoughts to
[1:39:52] the word you feed on the word you find a
[1:39:55] situation in your life and you search
[1:39:57] the
[1:39:58] word and then you repeat that word to
[1:40:01] yourself over and over again and then
[1:40:03] you repeat it to God and you remind God
[1:40:04] this is your promise for me right now
[1:40:08] I'm receiving it by faith thank you Lord
[1:40:11] that's exactly what the word says to do
[1:40:13] take that walk in that and you'll be an
[1:40:16] overcomer amen let's
[1:40:21] stand Heavenly Father we thank you so
