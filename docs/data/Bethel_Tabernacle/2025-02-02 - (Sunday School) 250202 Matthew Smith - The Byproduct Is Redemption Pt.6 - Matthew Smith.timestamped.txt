[0:02] gracious father Lord we invite you into
[0:04] our Sunday school this morning Father as
[0:07] we come before you opening our hearts to
[0:10] the word Lord that You' come down and
[0:13] edify us that father wouldn't just be
[0:16] some idea or some thing that I would
[0:18] have come up with but Lord that you
[0:20] would speak through this
[0:27] microphone strength andage enouragement
[0:30] father that they would grow stronger and
[0:33] and and closer to you father and and
[0:35] that you would go out and meet the needs
[0:37] of the people father we open this
[0:40] service with an in an invitation to your
[0:42] Holy Spirit to move this morning that I
[0:45] would step out of the way and that my
[0:46] emotions would not Cloud what you would
[0:49] have to say we ask these things in the
[0:50] name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen um I
[0:54] want to turn this
[0:56] morning um this is just kind of
[0:59] continuation of
[1:00] the my series that I've been doing and I
[1:02] I had thought the last time I did this
[1:03] this was the LA that was the last part
[1:05] but it was not um so uh the Lord kind of
[1:09] gave me something this morning kind of
[1:11] in that same topic and the same theme um
[1:14] so if we would let's turn to um Genesis
[1:17] chapter 1 and 26
[1:32] said
[1:36] um did
[1:39] I yeah Genesis chapter 1 and 26 and God
[1:43] said let us make man in our image after
[1:45] our likeness and let them have dominion
[1:47] over the fish of the sea and over the
[1:49] foul of the air and over the cattle and
[1:52] over all the Earth and over every
[1:54] creeping thing that creepeth upon the
[1:56] Earth so God created man in his own
[1:58] image the image of God created he him
[2:01] male and female created he them and God
[2:03] blessed them and God said unto them be
[2:05] fruitful and multiply and replenish the
[2:07] Earth and subdue it and have dominion
[2:09] over the fish of the sea and over the
[2:10] foul of the air and over every living
[2:12] thing that moveth upon the Earth um and
[2:15] then one other scripture I want to read
[2:17] is 1 Timothy Chapter
[2:19] 2 um and verse
[2:24] 11 which um I'll just read it if y'all
[2:27] y'all don't have to turn to it just for
[2:28] the interest of time um it said uh let
[2:31] the woman learn in Silence with all
[2:32] subjection but I suffer not a woman to
[2:34] teach uh nor to use Ser authority over
[2:37] the man but to be in silence for Adam
[2:38] was first formed in Eve and Adam was not
[2:41] deceived but the woman being deceived
[2:42] was in the transgression notwithstanding
[2:45] she shall be saved in childbearing if
[2:47] they continue in faith and charity and
[2:49] Holiness with sobriety y'all can be
[2:51] seated um
[2:53] now I wanted as sort of a brief sort of
[2:58] continuation of the idea of the of the
[3:00] thought that we had the last time we did
[3:01] one uh Sunday school which I think is
[3:03] about a a little over a month ago
[3:07] um uh we talked about this scripture in
[3:10] in uh 1 Timothy Chapter 2 and about how
[3:13] that the Plan of Redemption all
[3:15] throughout the Bible Redemption is tied
[3:16] to a woman uh giving birth to a child um
[3:20] with with um Adam and Eve that Eve or
[3:23] Adam had gone to Eve and through that
[3:25] came Abel and also Redemption of Eve
[3:28] back to Adam um we talked about
[3:30] obviously Ruth and Boaz that in order
[3:32] for Ruth to be properly redeemed to Boaz
[3:34] in the in under the Hebrew law um or in
[3:37] order for uh Boaz to properly redeem
[3:39] Ruth there had to be a union and
[3:41] ultimately the birth of a son um we
[3:45] talked about um how uh you know we see
[3:48] this theme throughout the entire Bible
[3:49] obviously with with Mary um giving birth
[3:52] to the Christ child and how all
[3:55] Redemption would come through that um
[3:57] and there's this you know overarching
[3:59] thing and then ultim L we talked about
[4:02] um uh John the Revelator in Revelations
[4:06] chapter 10 and how you know this exact
[4:10] same formula you know formula in sort of
[4:13] in a natural sense is also typed in the
[4:15] spiritual how John how he you know he
[4:18] took the word right the the life of the
[4:20] word in Revelation chapter 10 he ate the
[4:22] book and then replicated or expressed
[4:25] The Life of Christ back out when he
[4:27] prophesied again um and how this is the
[4:30] same uh sort of it's what the bride is
[4:34] expected to do right that we talk about
[4:36] you know the the invisible Union of of
[4:39] Christ and the church well what is that
[4:41] exactly right well it is Christ coming
[4:44] down building relationship with the
[4:46] church and through that relationship
[4:48] would ultimately be the the process by
[4:52] which the bride would then replicate The
[4:54] Life of Christ again amen okay it's this
[4:57] it's that same uh
[5:00] process um you know we talk about um
[5:02] letting the word be born in us like it
[5:05] was in Mary right it's it's the Christ
[5:08] again being born again through the lives
[5:10] of Christians living in this time right
[5:14] but that would process would come
[5:16] through feeding on the word by because
[5:18] Christ is the word by building that
[5:20] relationship with scripture through the
[5:22] teachings through the the the the
[5:24] feeding on the word for our day by by
[5:27] doing that you're building a
[5:28] relationship with Christ through his
[5:31] word which will then ultimately allow
[5:33] you to express back out what it is that
[5:35] you've been feeding on right the same
[5:36] life that you've been uh taking on will
[5:39] then Express back out through you and um
[5:44] I just a a continuation of that
[5:47] idea is actually um in communion right
[5:51] in the communion story because you know
[5:53] when in the in the story you know he he
[5:55] breaks the bread he you know eat you
[5:58] know he tells them to eat uh take the
[6:00] the the bread and the wine and um then
[6:05] he goes and washes their feet right he
[6:07] says the bread is his body right and so
[6:11] he he's you know we do this every year
[6:13] as sort of you know we know the Lord's
[6:15] supper and communion foot washing and we
[6:16] do this you know at least at this church
[6:18] maybe we've done it different times
[6:19] throughout the years um usually you know
[6:22] once a year on New Year's Eve but you
[6:24] know different churches do it different
[6:25] ways there's no real hard fast you know
[6:28] rule Bible just says Christ just said do
[6:30] it often in remembrance of me well how
[6:32] often is often right and that's you know
[6:35] up to the leading of of the individual
[6:36] pastor but what I don't want us to do
[6:38] and what I you just kind of uh to
[6:41] something to highlight is
[6:43] that you know um yes we do the sort of I
[6:48] don't want to say ritualized form but
[6:50] for lack of a better word ritualized
[6:51] form of the of the of the communion
[6:53] service maybe once a year maybe twice a
[6:55] year once a month however often um it
[6:59] you know different churches do it
[7:00] differently like I said but
[7:02] realistically really what the the point
[7:04] of that is is to remind us what is we
[7:09] doing it in remembrance of Christ and
[7:11] the the whole Plan of Redemption which
[7:13] is every single day you should be having
[7:16] a form of communion when you feed on the
[7:18] word you eat the body of Christ in the
[7:20] word and then what will it produce it
[7:22] will produce the character to serve your
[7:25] brother right it you know that story
[7:28] happens deliber liely didn't is not
[7:30] willy-nilly right when supper being
[7:32] ended then he washed his brother you
[7:35] know washed the feet of the
[7:36] disciples why because you feed on the
[7:38] word first and then it creates the
[7:39] character of Christ that will then
[7:40] perform the acts of service that Christ
[7:43] performed right and you can see and if
[7:46] you're doing communion correctly that's
[7:49] what it should be producing and just to
[7:51] to illustrate something you know the
[7:54] Catholics have communion every service
[7:57] but when was the last time you saw them
[7:59] break out the water and start washing
[8:01] feet right there they go together you
[8:04] can't have the one without the other
[8:05] because if all you're doing is is well
[8:08] we're feeding on the word but it never
[8:10] produces a lifestyle of of humility and
[8:14] service and Christ's
[8:15] nature then I'm not convinced that what
[8:18] you have is the word right or you're not
[8:21] feeding on it correctly right you're
[8:23] there's something wrong there
[8:24] something's not
[8:27] working because it should be you should
[8:29] be producing Redemption of bringing your
[8:32] character back in line with uh with the
[8:36] word um now I want to move on from that
[8:40] because there's a uh
[8:44] a I I I started this is just something
[8:47] that kind of came to me this morning and
[8:48] I I really is kind of what's burning on
[8:50] my
[8:51] heart
[8:54] um I uh I started this whole series with
[8:58] kind of um taking on a a particular
[9:01] quote those of you who remember that far
[9:03] back took I I I read this quote where in
[9:06] marriage and divorce brother brand talks
[9:07] about the woman being a byproduct and
[9:09] how so many people understandably so
[9:12] it's not a this isn't a criticism um but
[9:14] so many people uh have a hard time with
[9:17] that quote because it's it's you know it
[9:19] doesn't feel nice um and how and I went
[9:23] through the whole thing and and I don't
[9:25] obviously don't have time to re go over
[9:26] all that again if you want to hear that
[9:28] by all means we archives
[9:31] um but uh how but there's there was a
[9:34] lot more to it than that it's actually a
[9:35] beautiful thing if you get past sort of
[9:37] the the uh spooky exterior of that um
[9:41] quote and really look at what he was
[9:43] trying to say and what the scripture
[9:44] says and and the whole type of
[9:45] everything it's actually a lot more
[9:47] beautiful than than you might first
[9:49] think and there's another concept that I
[9:52] people have many preachers have have
[9:55] pointed out and it a lot of times
[9:57] bothers people and it bothered me for a
[10:01] long time and so I I want to kind of uh
[10:04] approach this and that is we talk about
[10:07] how in you know how when God made ab and
[10:10] Eve um how Eve was a weaker vessel and
[10:13] God knew that she was going to fall
[10:15] right God knew that she was going to she
[10:16] was going to fall and that that it was
[10:18] going to lead to the fall of Mankind
[10:20] through Adam and then and but God needed
[10:23] Eve Adam kind of needed Eve to be the
[10:25] weaker vessel because he had this
[10:28] attribute of a redeemer inside of him
[10:29] that he had to be fulfilled in order for
[10:33] him to be a fulfilled being right he had
[10:35] to be fulfill this attribute of Redeemer
[10:37] and if he had nobody to redeem and
[10:39] nobody ever fell then he would never be
[10:40] able to express the attribute of
[10:42] Redeemer um and likewise
[10:45] god
[10:47] um made man such that he knew man would
[10:50] fall he knew man was weak he knew man
[10:52] would fall because God had the attribute
[10:54] of Redeemer that he had to express and
[10:56] if there was nobody to save then he
[10:58] would never be a able to ex be fulfilled
[11:01] as a
[11:02] savior and and it's it can be a
[11:06] beautiful thing but but there's always
[11:08] the immediate question but wait a minute
[11:09] hold on hold on hold on so God made us
[11:12] flawed on purpose and now we have to
[11:15] suffer the consequences of God making us
[11:17] broken on
[11:19] purpose right like that seems kind of
[11:22] you know to the human mind it almost
[11:24] seems kind of like self-serving
[11:27] and unfair
[11:30] but I I just want to show you
[11:34] something when God made man he made both
[11:38] of them male and female Adam and Eve
[11:40] were made together and they were both
[11:42] made in the image of God everything
[11:44] inside of Adam was part of God and
[11:46] everything inside of Eve was part of God
[11:48] that she wasn't made out of castoff
[11:50] spare parts right she was as intentional
[11:53] as Adam
[11:54] was and if Adam inside of him had had an
[11:59] attribute to be a
[12:02] redeemer well didn't Eve also have an
[12:05] attribute inside of her that long to be
[12:07] redeemed amen is that not also the case
[12:11] doesn't Humanity don't we say this so
[12:13] often doesn't this a sort of a saying I
[12:16] I don't remember exactly where it
[12:18] originated so you know I don't know what
[12:20] to attribute it to but um I once heard
[12:23] and it just struck me so strongly um
[12:25] that every human being is born with a
[12:27] god-shaped hole in their heart and
[12:29] nothing they ever do other than like try
[12:31] to fill it with other than God will
[12:33] actually fill that every human being
[12:36] desires to be redeemed where did that
[12:39] come from that was an attribute of God
[12:43] it had to come from God where else did
[12:45] it come from it didn't come from the
[12:46] devil right it was part of God there was
[12:49] as much as Adam needed to feel like a
[12:53] you know fulfill the role of Redeemer in
[12:55] order for him to be fulfilled Eve needed
[12:57] to fulfill the role of the redeem Ed in
[12:59] order for her to feel fulfilled
[13:03] okay look if if the sort of natural
[13:07] typing the
[13:08] spiritual when you know it's not an
[13:11] accident that one of like the most uh
[13:16] basic widespread Universal cliche tropes
[13:20] of you know women what women find
[13:24] romantic is the hero who comes in and
[13:26] rescues her right like Saves the Day
[13:29] it's why we talk about the night and
[13:30] shining armor the prince charming the
[13:32] girl getting rescued from the dragon and
[13:33] I know it gets cliched into the ground
[13:35] and so it's by now most people kind of
[13:37] like roll their eyes at the whole at the
[13:39] such a simple story but
[13:43] consider
[13:45] look you know uh every
[13:48] girl on some level wants to feel
[13:52] beautiful and desired and and and
[13:55] respected and special and like she's not
[13:58] an off cast and that there is somebody
[14:00] willing to move heavens and earth just
[14:02] for her in particular because she feels
[14:05] ugly and unwanted and unlovable and all
[14:08] these things and all these women
[14:10] struggle with
[14:11] insecurity it's like one of the
[14:13] fundamental concepts of being a woman
[14:16] apparently
[14:18] and what girl is going to meet some guy
[14:22] who makes her feel the opposite of all
[14:23] of that like she's beautiful and cared
[14:25] for and loved and provided for and that
[14:27] he's she he finds things she's speci
[14:29] and is willing to do everything for her
[14:31] and you know it's the the Trope is what
[14:34] it is because it's Universal girls will
[14:38] be swept off their feet by a guy who
[14:40] makes them feel beautiful and special
[14:42] and and
[14:44] loved what's happening there there is a
[14:48] night and shining armor riding in to
[14:50] kill the dragon of insecurity that's
[14:52] been eating them from the inside out
[14:55] right I mean it it's not it's it's not
[14:59] that that uh you
[15:03] know so so you know we
[15:06] we it's just a type to show that that's
[15:09] exactly what God does it shows the
[15:12] relationship with with man to God
[15:15] because as much as you know every girl
[15:18] gets swept off their feet by their the
[15:20] hero who makes them feel loved and
[15:22] cherished and
[15:23] special human everybody who's ever been
[15:27] encoun you know looked around them and
[15:29] saw the the Calamity of their own life
[15:32] and saw how their own actions have led
[15:34] to the destruction of their own life
[15:36] have seen how I've done wrong and it has
[15:39] led to my family getting hurt people who
[15:41] care about me getting hurt myself
[15:43] getting hurt all of it and then God
[15:46] comes down and says but none of that
[15:47] matters I'm saving you and and and I
[15:51] don't you know he can Overlook all of
[15:53] that and rescue rescue you in particular
[15:56] from the wretchedness that is yourself
[15:59] amen right that's that sweeps us off our
[16:02] feet because there's there's something
[16:04] inside of every human being that longs
[16:06] for Redemption it Longs for Redemption
[16:09] and how could God how could you ever
[16:11] spend you know the whole purpose of all
[16:13] of this is that you end up spending an
[16:15] eternity with your sa with your savior
[16:17] but how do you have a fulfilled
[16:20] relationship when neither party ever got
[16:24] to fulfill the attributes that make them
[16:27] who they're supposed to be amen you're
[16:30] never how you're never going to have the
[16:32] same relationship with God you're never
[16:34] going to have the uh you know imagine a
[16:36] world for a second in which God none of
[16:39] this ever happened right none of the the
[16:41] fall never happened sin never happened
[16:42] it was all just
[16:44] whatever God just made everybody into a
[16:46] perfect paradise and nobody ever sinned
[16:48] and nobody ever failed and nobody ever
[16:50] had
[16:51] to you know uh nobody ever had to
[16:55] experience what it was like to need a
[16:57] savior and then receive
[17:00] salvation that is so much less of a of a
[17:04] of a deep relationship that is so much
[17:07] of a more so much shallower of a
[17:09] relationship but one in which all of
[17:12] humanity you know in for all of eternity
[17:15] is so grateful for what God did for them
[17:18] yeah so recognizing of of the of the
[17:21] price that was paid so so grateful
[17:24] having fulfilled what they were made to
[17:27] do right
[17:29] I promise you Humanity throughout all of
[17:32] eternity will feel so much deeper of a
[17:35] of a desire and a and a connection with
[17:37] Christ having been redeemed than if
[17:40] nothing bad would have ever happened
[17:42] right as much
[17:45] as uh God needed to feel like a redeemer
[17:49] we all needed to feel saved we all
[17:53] needed to express that because without
[17:55] it you just your relationship with God
[17:57] will not be the same
[17:59] right if you're not uh uh uh recognizing
[18:03] what God
[18:04] did the the relationship will never uh
[18:07] there's no bond there right right
[18:10] there's no grat there's nothing holding
[18:11] it together amen and
[18:14] so you know so many times people will
[18:18] take that longing that desire which is
[18:21] actually an attribute of God inside of
[18:23] them longing for God and try to fill it
[18:27] with all sorts of stuff right you know
[18:30] people we we we try to fill it with with
[18:34] you know whatever it may be you know the
[18:36] easy ones are drugs you know people no
[18:38] matter how much dope people smoke much
[18:40] liquor they drink no matter pills they
[18:42] pop it's never going to change the fact
[18:44] that they're Desiring something it'll
[18:47] quiet it down for a minute right it'll
[18:50] it'll you know knock the edge off for a
[18:52] minute it'll it'll put you out of your
[18:53] right mind long enough to where you
[18:55] won't recognize that you need God for a
[18:58] minute
[18:59] and then it's gone and then it's over
[19:01] and then you you have to chase it again
[19:04] just to get rid of you know quiet your
[19:07] conscience down long enough for it to
[19:09] not be tormenting you right and people
[19:11] will either try to fill it with drugs or
[19:13] they'll fill it with entertainment you
[19:15] know if they just consume enough
[19:16] entertainment it'll distract them from
[19:17] the the fact that they're you know uh
[19:21] not um Allowing God to to to be the
[19:25] Fulfillment that they're looking for you
[19:27] know I heard a um I I saw a long time
[19:30] ago I was doing some AC work for
[19:33] somebody and um I go in the house and
[19:36] they have on the wall a whiteboard I
[19:37] don't know where this came from I don't
[19:38] know if they came up with this or they
[19:39] saw it somewhere else but they just
[19:40] wrote on the Whiteboard if you don't
[19:42] know what you're looking for you will
[19:43] never find it amen and that's what
[19:47] people have they are looking for
[19:48] something they have no idea what it is
[19:50] right they are looking and looking and
[19:52] looking they're looking down every
[19:53] bottle they're looking under you know
[19:55] looking under every paycheck you know
[19:57] they work themselves in the ground to
[19:58] find a bigger paycheck maybe if they
[19:59] build a big enough house they'll find it
[20:01] maybe if they have a nice enough car
[20:02] they'll find it maybe if you know they
[20:05] uh you know go have enough entertainment
[20:07] they'll find what what it is that
[20:08] they're looking for maybe if you know
[20:11] you know girls think that they're
[20:12] they'll uh they'll find what they're
[20:14] looking for with enough you know plastic
[20:15] surgery and O zic right uh guys think
[20:18] they'll find what they're looking for if
[20:19] they have a fat enough paycheck and a
[20:21] big enough brokerage account right
[20:24] everybody's looking for something but at
[20:26] the at the end of the day that that that
[20:28] something they're looking for is God
[20:32] it's the it's Redemption it's salvation
[20:34] and they're and and and you know you try
[20:36] to uh try to quiet it try to kill it
[20:40] with with that that that thirst that
[20:43] hunger for God and you try to kill it
[20:45] with uh you know whatever you know
[20:47] whatever it is that that people are
[20:49] chasing and all it's going to do is make
[20:53] what you
[20:54] have
[20:57] unsatisfactory right the the the
[21:00] pleasure that you have no matter how
[21:02] great it was in the moment the second
[21:04] you realize that it is not filling the
[21:06] hole in your heart it will become
[21:08] unsatisfactory amen right and it's just
[21:12] people can you know you chase a a a
[21:15] material or a a a materialistic
[21:19] satisfaction for a spiritual thirst amen
[21:23] the whole world will never satisfy it
[21:25] amen the whole world will never satisfy
[21:28] that nagging little conscience in the
[21:31] bottom of your heart that's saying you
[21:32] need
[21:34] godallah nothing will ever will ever
[21:36] satisfy it amen except for
[21:41] God
[21:43] and that's good that is that is that is
[21:48] the attribute of God inside of you God
[21:50] put that there on purpose because once
[21:52] you actually satisfy it once you
[21:55] actually find the thing that will
[21:57] satisfy it which is nothing short of the
[21:59] Holy Ghost once you find that and and
[22:02] and actually satisfy that
[22:04] thirst well then you realize you don't
[22:06] need any this other stuff you don't need
[22:08] the massive house you don't need all the
[22:10] the the pills and and potions and and
[22:12] concoctions and whatever that a drug
[22:14] dealer will want to sell you right you
[22:16] don't need all of the the the material
[22:19] things of the world you don't need all
[22:22] of these uh you know you know whatever
[22:25] chasing things to to to satisfy by this
[22:30] desire because it's been fulfilled right
[22:32] the hole in your heart has been
[22:35] actually filled with something real and
[22:39] once you get there then you're you know
[22:42] you recognize that the all the rest of
[22:44] this is a sham right you actually have
[22:46] the you you find the peace that God
[22:49] intended you to have from the
[22:51] beginning that you only could have found
[22:55] if you fell in the first place right but
[22:58] you never would have been able to reach
[23:00] that point the the point of fulfillment
[23:03] and satisfaction and and genuine actual
[23:06] closeness with
[23:08] God you never could have reached that
[23:10] until you fell and recognizes recognized
[23:13] how much how how wonderful of a savior
[23:16] savior Christ can
[23:19] be
[23:22] and you know um so many times
[23:27] people we get hung up on stuff we get we
[23:30] get uh the devil will try to convince us
[23:33] that God um you know that
[23:37] that well I'll just maybe put it like
[23:40] this is the way it was on my heart this
[23:42] morning I was thinking a lot about how I
[23:43] got saved and there was a a moment when
[23:47] I'm sitting in the back office over here
[23:50] talking to brother Jason
[23:52] and I'm struggling because you know I'm
[23:55] like I don't even know what to believe
[23:56] anymore and and you know I I you know
[23:59] just believe in different things and and
[24:01] confused so confused and and brother
[24:03] Jason finally looks at me he's like
[24:04] listen and I remember I
[24:07] remember I I can't prove what I'm about
[24:09] to say to you I just know when I when it
[24:11] happened to me I knew what I saw me and
[24:14] brother Jason had this like two hour
[24:15] long conversation went absolutely
[24:16] nowhere I felt dissatisfied at the end
[24:18] of it he felt frustrated at the end of
[24:20] it and which you know in hindsight and
[24:23] I've heard his side of the story since
[24:24] then and you know he knew kind of knew
[24:25] exactly what was going on and I didn't
[24:27] but
[24:29] I'm you know we're kind of getting to
[24:32] the end of it and finally brother Jason
[24:33] which later I found out he' actually
[24:35] brother uh in prayer the Lord had told
[24:37] him to say this exactly like the day
[24:40] before but we get to the end of it and
[24:41] finally he stops and goes all right look
[24:43] here's the point of this whole thing he
[24:44] said you don't need to be convinced or
[24:47] you don't need to uh um be convinced
[24:51] that God is real right like you you've
[24:53] already like you're struggling trying to
[24:56] you know find something to believe in
[24:57] that you believe in God but you already
[24:59] believe in God because you believe in
[25:01] the you you're in love with God and you
[25:03] and you're because you're in love with
[25:06] the physical form of God you're love
[25:08] with God in flesh and so You' you've
[25:10] seen God In the Flesh and you know what
[25:12] that is which without getting into my
[25:15] whole life story The the exact words
[25:17] that he said were literally like the
[25:20] verbatim words to question answers to
[25:22] questions that he didn't know that I had
[25:24] um and and different things and and it
[25:27] just sort of just all clar for me in
[25:28] that moment but what caught me is right
[25:30] before he said that he kind of leaned
[25:32] back in his chair and right before he
[25:34] said it I literally saw light in his
[25:36] eyes like I saw light come into the room
[25:39] and and it was like it caught my
[25:42] attention and the reality is so many
[25:46] people we struggle with
[25:48] um do I you know is God still in my life
[25:52] do I what do I even believe do you know
[25:54] I feel so dry as a Christian I don't
[25:56] feel like I
[25:58] I you know like a Christian or
[26:01] whatever but the fact of the matter is
[26:03] you still long to be right you still
[26:05] long for righteousness you still long
[26:07] for salvation you still even if you
[26:10] don't you might not necessarily in your
[26:12] mind believe it but there's something in
[26:14] your heart that tells you that you want
[26:16] to be good amen there's something in
[26:18] your in in your heart that tells you you
[26:19] want to be right that you want to be
[26:21] righteous that you want to be pure that
[26:23] you don't want to be subject to you know
[26:27] the whims and desires of your flesh that
[26:28] you want to be right even if you don't
[26:30] feel it nothing was ever based on
[26:33] feelings right faith is feelings are
[26:36] anathema to Faith right if you want to
[26:39] kill your faith is faster than anything
[26:41] get into your feelings right like you
[26:45] know the reality is have faith in your
[26:48] salvation regard the fact that you
[26:51] desire that the fact that that there's
[26:53] something down in your heart that's
[26:54] longing for God no matter how deep of a
[26:57] hole you found yourself in the fact that
[26:59] you're longing for God means there's a
[27:01] part of God inside of you calling back
[27:03] to God right that there's a deep in you
[27:06] that's calling to the deep in God and
[27:08] those deeps respond to each other as
[27:10] much as you long for a savior the Savior
[27:12] Longs for you right and as much as if
[27:16] God so loved the world right God so
[27:18] loved the whole world you know even your
[27:21] wretched self and my wretched self right
[27:25] if God so loved all of that right that
[27:29] there's something inside of him that's
[27:31] Desiring the people of the world then
[27:34] the thing inside of you is just as sure
[27:36] as the thing inside of him amen right
[27:39] they have to come together whatever it
[27:41] is inside of you that's Longing To Be
[27:43] Good Will absolutely be
[27:46] fulfilled it has
[27:48] to and I'm out of time so let's stand
[27:52] and have a quick word of Prayer
[28:00] amen father Lord we come this morning
[28:03] thanking you for this time that we could
[28:04] come together as a church family to
[28:07] think on the things of your word Lord
[28:09] that maybe something that was said today
[28:11] this morning would be encouraging would
[28:14] be edifying to the people that they
[28:15] would draw strength from it and could
[28:18] move forward and and and not be so
[28:21] distracted and bound by the things of
[28:23] the world when the devil would come
[28:25] against them to to Blind their eyes to
[28:27] to to discourage them to convince them
[28:29] of of of the the you know to turn their
[28:34] head their their eyes from you Lord that
[28:37] that Lord your your word would give them
[28:39] strength and encouragement that they
[28:40] would press forward and and lay claim to
[28:43] your promises father we ask you'd be
[28:46] with us through the remainder of the
[28:47] service into the worship service and
