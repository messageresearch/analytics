you say Amen the more you're sicken if you have your Bibles let's turn to Luke 1 and we'll read verse 2627 28 they have a PowerPoint they don't have everything I got but I put a few things up there and I won't use the clicker so just whenever you feel put something up go ahead Luke 1 ver 26 and in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God into a city of Galilee named Nazareth to a virgin exposed to a man whose name was Joseph of the House of David and the virgin's name was Mary and the angel came in unto her and said hell Thou Art highly favored the Lord is with thee blessed art thou among women now over in Ephesians chapter 1 over we'll read two verses there chapter 1 verse verses 5 having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved may God add His blessings to his reading you can have your seats for a title this evening I want to speak on a highly fav Ed woman so this is going to be my Christmas message to you I'm not going to preach on Santa Claus or Christmas lights or Christmas trees if you got zero Christmas trees you got one or you got four it don't matter to me I'm not going to preach on that tonight but we're going to preach on Christmas but I believe tonight that I'm looking at a woman specially highly favored of God called called according to his purpose but none of us is good cuz what Jesus says is none of us is good call no man good cuz none of us is good so God if God was just looking at our flesh he'd see a bunch of sorry human beings I'm talking about myself and the people on the internet none of you here but as myself we're a bunch of sorry human beings but why would God even choose us what what in US made us special amen amen God's Got Us marked but what in the world did God even see in us we are a marked people each one of us is marked you're going to be marked by something you'll be marked by God or you'll be marked by the mark of the beast Hallelujah you know when a doctor spanks you when a baby comes out a doctor will spank that baby and breathe the bread of life the breath of life that seed drops down inside their heart and from that point on that baby's marked not every baby but if you were a predestinated seed you were marked when you were when you were born CU that seed come inside your heart when you took that first Breath of Life a seed that was given to you before the foundation of the world God just looks down on the inside he don't care how ugly we are or how pretty you are or how pretty you think you are God just looks down on the inside of you and sees what he put down inside of you you we're a special people we are called of God ordained for this before the foundation of the world we're the Queen of Heaven does people realize when you go to work and who they're working beside you know Jackson whenever he works at the coffee place he's making coffee besides one of the co-workers does that person realize that who they working with when you at Walmart people just walking by and they're making fun of you they're making fun of the Queen of Heaven and when you're out doing Plumbing does those people know who's working for them that's how special you are that's how special we're a special people Queen of Heaven they don't realize They're laughing at the Queen of Heaven when they do that when they're laugh making fun of you God chose you over all the women of the world he chose over the Baptist he chose you over the Methodist he chose you over some so-called message Believers Hallelujah you're a special people young people he chose you he marked you of all the young people in this whole area God chose a little handful sitting right here tonight he marked you you're a special person you know in this Bible there's all kinds of promises you know I looked it up some somebody say is there anywhere from 3,000 to 8,000 promises in this Bible for you promises like he who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved he will strengthen you and help you he will keep you in perfect peace those whose minds are steadfast he will never leave you nor forsake you he will give you peace in the midst of the storm I will be a comfort in the time of need and we can just go on and on to thousands of them but these promises are gifts God has given us these precious gifts gifts of healing Gifts of Deliverance Gifts of Salvation he says I will give you the gift of the Holy Ghost gifts that are given to the Queen of Heaven only you know we're a couple of days away from what the world celebrating the birth of Jesus of course we all know he wasn't born December 25th but that's just a time set aside to for them to celebrate the birth of the Lord I'm not here to celebrate the birth of the Lord even though it was great it had to happen God had to come down and become a flesh body but he's not in a Manger tonight I'm not here to celebrate Jesus being born I'm celebrating his death I'm celebrating his resurrection I'm celebrating when he came back on the day of Pentecost and came down into 120 of them and that's same Holy Ghost is living in us that's what I'm celebrating I'm celebrating Calvary when Jesus was dragging that cross up the hill that blood pulling down he got the crown of thorns that's what I'm celebrating of what he done for me he couldn't save me in the manger that's a lot of people's left him in the manger my my aunt who who's passed away now wrote a song they got him back in the manger again if y'all ever heard it's a that's a good song she wrote it it was great but we're not here to celebrate a birth we're here to celebrate what he's done for us hallelujah they set me free from sin Hallelujah but this is a time of giving gifts oh this time of Christmas people spend the money they don't have paying for gifts they'll be paying on till next Christmas for what go and say oh I got to go this store they got a big sale what they've done they've marked it up and then dropped 50% on it nothing but a bunch of money racket but I'll take gifts if y'all gonna buy me something I'll take it just go stand in line it don't matter what you get I mean you might be getting a new video game might get a new outfit or a new golf club or or whatever it is what kind of gift you want I could ask for for a greater gift God gave us the greatest gift of all when he gave himself God who stepped down from Glory went to the Cross brother BR said in God's WRA gift I love this quote I send this to people every year they're probably tired of saying it but I love it just a little while from then and the world was going to receive its greatest gift that it ever received a little package wrapped up a little first little Christmas package that was ever wrapped in all the world God wrapped it up I want to break in on my thought and say this the greatest thing was ever wrapped in human flesh was wrapped in it God himself wrapped his own self Hallelujah in a Christmas package and sent it to the world why did they refuse it why could they see it why did they turn it down down why is it they didn't want it the same reason they don't want it tonight it wasn't pretty enough it was Jesus in a manger wrapped up in a dirty old swaddling cloth that was his present wrapped in swaddling would you open up a gift that somebody wrapped up in swaddling cloth we'll move on the same reason they don't want tonight it wasn't handed to them cuss they were used to gift being handed that's the reason it's rejected tonight is because it's not handed to the people with the custom that they've been used to re receiving gifts but God wraps his own package he's got a right to it he's the one that's given it he has a right to wrap it in any way he wants to wrap it and doesn't make any difference how it is he's got a right to do it because he's the one that's given the gift if I'm going to give you a gift don't make fun of how it's wrapped it's my gift I'm give you I wrap it the way I want to that was free it ought to be real attractive to the people little Jehovah crying like a baby God made flesh in a package God who covers all space and time was before there was a world or a star or a molecule wrapped himself in a little package and was laid in a Manger in a stable with the manures of the cattle and sheep and things up over that stable in this little manger of straw or hay Jehovah was laying there crying like a baby can you imagine that but what you do with a gift is up to you take this off it's time to preach what you do if a gift is up to you if somebody's give you a gift you say you won't put up on your table and say man that's a beautiful present man that ribbon I love that color it's so pretty I'm not even going to open it how many here has done that no you go in and you'll rip it open you don't care what that package looks like you'll rip it open to see what's on the inside of it when we got the greatest gift standing here tonight waiting for you to unwrap it but we don't want to leave him off in a corner somewhere Jesus with dirty feet we're not like the Pharisees we want Jesus come on in I want all the gifts you got open up that gift it might be your healing tonight open up that gift it might be your salvation open up that gift it might be your Holy Ghost you've been searching for but now I thank you for my gift Hallelujah if we just realize what's on the inside of that gift inside his peace inside is Joy inside his longsuffering inside is gentleness and meekness and you get the picture all kinds of gifts is wrapped up in this thing hallelujah what other saw in the manger was a little baby others some saw eternal life there's my ticket to eternal life this baby's going to grow up he's going to go to Calvary that's my ticket Luke Luke 1 128 and the angel came unto her and said hell Thou Art highly favored I love this definition make accepted Hallelujah we were made accepted to make graceful charming love lovely agreeable woo I know some people's not like that to make graceful full of grace we have unmar favor we didn't deserve it but we got it that's what unmerited means we don't deserve it but we got it anyway to peruse with Grace compass with favor to honor with blessings hell Mary highly favored of God I looked up that word peruse and I even had to click the little speaker button to know how to say it it means to ex examine with attention and detail Oh Glory God is looking over us to examine us with such great detail because and he looking over at Mary because he knew 400 years before that a prophet said a virgin shall conceive so that word's going to come to pass so God was watching and he's seen this one girl raise up and he watched her with such great detail God is watching us with such great detail tonight to see are you making yourself ready God's not going to do it he's not going to make you ready have you made yourself ready he give you what you need it's up to you to use that you need overcoming power tap the source we have to make ourselves ready he's not going to do it we must do it cu the Bible says his wife hath made herself ready make your election sure so God had watched Mary and paid attention to her and the angel came into her and said hell Thou Art highly favored the Lord is with thee blessed art thou among women blessed art thou among women blessed means to speak well of Hallelujah Lord speak well of me tonight you know like when when Satan come up before God where you been devil oh I've been roaming to and fro on the earth oh have you considered my servant job that there's none like him in the land oh I want God to say that about me I want to be praised by God have you consider my servant Gideon Watkins there's none like him in the land Hallelujah and when she saw him she was troubled at this saying and cast in her mind says what manner of salutation this should be what a greeting what a greeting blessed art thou among women what have I done to deserve it nothing what have we done to deserve what God's done for us nothing Hallelujah God was searching for her and the angel said unto her fear not Mary for thou Hast found found means to come upon to meet with after searching so God after searching found Mary so God after searching found you you didn't go searching for God we were happy in what we were doing we didn't have a thought we might have had a seed but we didn't we didn't care nothing about it we didn't know anything about it all we cared about how he going to get our next fix how he going to how he's going to afford to go to our next trip or or or anything like that Hallelujah found God came looking for you we weren't looking for God hallelujah thou Hast found favor with God favor means Grace yes amen Noah found Grace in the eyes of the Lord found favor Grace that which affords joy and pleasure if you got Grace you're going to have be full of joy you're going to be full of pleasure Delight sweetness charm loveliness Grace of speech this is what he was saying about Mary what a woman what a woman Mary was am but remember she was a top of the Bride so what a woman you are full of joy pleasure Delight sweetness charm loveliness Grace of speech if we don't have none of that come on up here and let's get it Hallelujah thanks he gives thanks to her you know for benefits and services unmerited Grace I said it a bit ago unmerited means not deserved not even earned brother Ram said invisible Union you are wearing this wedding band of predestinated unmerited Grace a wedding band of Grace unmar of your own God did it himself he knew you before the foundation of the world so He Slipped the wedding band on you there and put your name on the book another place he says through that blood he Sanctified a church that he might continue the work himself living in that church that makes him the same yesterday today and forever we are absolutely Unworthy of any blessing there's nothing we can do to Merit that but by unmerited Grace God gave us this privilege to be called what a privilege to be called the children of God hallelujah Mary he says you're highly favored you are the girl Isaiah spoke about Behold a virgin shall conceive his name Shall be Called Emanuel counselor the Prince of Peace Mighty God and he says and behold Thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth the Sun and shalt call his name the most powerful name that could ever be spoken Jesus what a name what a powerful name when the name of Jesus Is Spoken things happen we know what happened John the Baptist dead for six months first time Jesus was ever spoke out of human lips a dead baby came to life no longer did that baby came to life that baby received the Holy Ghost and no and the mother received the Holy Ghost as well at the name of Jesus skip a little bit says if that name of Jesus brought to life a dead baby the first time it was ever spoke through human lips it brought eternal life and the baptism of the Holy Ghost into a womb of Mary the Bible said John was born from his mother's womb full of the Holy Ghost it ought to heal the sick every person that's Bound by the devil because he says in my name they shall cast out Devils Hallelujah he says that wonderful name of the Lord Jesus laying in our fingertips laying just ready to receive it that same name of Jesus Christ is more powerful to ton night it ought to be among the people here tonight what it ought to do to a sick man or a sick woman what ought it do to a person that's Bound by the devil when his own promise Anchored In Heaven before God with his own blood to make good in the Holy Ghost showing signs and wonders what a name at that name of Jesus every knee shall bow cuz we know where the Bible says wherefore God has also highly exalted him and give him a name which is above every name that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven of things in Earth and things under the Earth and that every tongue is going to confess that Jesus Christ is Lord everything on Earth I don't care who you are I don't care if you're a Buddha I don't care if you're a Muslim I don't care if you're an atheist the Bible says everything will bow before Jesus and even the devil's going to Bow before him oh I long for that day when you see the devil just finally bow and I can see him bowing for Jesus I can imagine what he'd be saying he'd probably be asking for forgiveness but I want to be standing there I want God to use my foot when he's kneeled down over right through the pits of hell I want to give him a good kick I'm sure you're all going to be right beside him fighting for it we're all going to give him a good boot Hallelujah brother B said what a powerful name that the name his name is that he named his family Jesus but it was what Jesus did and what he was he was a heart of God what makes his name as rever tonight that all the family in heaven is named after him he died the cruelest death didn't have a place to lay his head and when God exalted him so high till he has to look down to see Heaven God in humility see and he give and he has to look down to see Heaven God in humility and he give him a name so great that the whole family of Heaven is named after him and every family on the Earth all the family on Earth is named Jesus all the family in heaven is named Jesus you're not Stephen Curtis you're M Jesus Christ that's your name everything else will bow to it brother say there's many fine women here in this building tonight fine loyal women but there's only one with Mrs William brandom she's the one that goes home with me she's the one that's going to be my wife there's fine people in all these churches but there's only one miss Jesus Christ there's good people out here in the world we run into good people it goes the denominational churches but there's only one miss Jesus Christ hey we hope they come over that's what we pray that's where his worship is where name lays there's where his worship is in her in her alone God's provided place of worship right here in your heart that's why we are all we do in word or deed we do it in the name of Jesus Christ there's not another name under heaven for salvation but the name of Jesus Christ Hallelujah highest heaven is named him all the family in heaven is named Jesus the Bible says all the family on Earth is named Jesus so that God's chosen name and where he has put it that's the place of worship is in Jesus Christ now we know that to be so no other place to worship but is in him we know we don't even have a right to speak the name of Jesus until we're ready to repent of our sins we can't even take his name until we're married to doing Sarah couldn't take my name until we were standing in front of the preacher do you yes she probably she said no but she said yes she stuck with me then she become m m Brad y so everything I had was hers she get to use my name you know a lot of people heard Jesus's name and SL play what if they you go out here world people say this all the time it's just like a second language to them did that do anything for you that makes you mad but one day we heard the name Jesus spoke the right way you know we were walking around the cigarettes stained fingers alcohol on our breath headphones in beep bopping to whatever you want to listen to We were dead walking around some somebody told you about Jesus or you might be here in a church pew preacher up here preaching and you heard Jesus spoke the right way something down on the inside of you came to life at that name of Jesus the most powerful name in the world the angel continued telling her he said he shall be great he shall be called the son of the highest the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever and his kingdom there shall be no end and then said Mary unto the angel how shall this be seeing I know not a man she was questioning the angel if you look at a few scriptures above there the same Angel was at Zach Zacharias in the temple well he told Zacharias says Elizabeth's going to have a child he's like how I'm 75 years old she's 75 years old how how am I you would think him being a priest that he remember the story of Abraham and Sarah what happened to them they had a baby he was 100 and she was 90 so 75 was nothing but instead him questioning the angel what happened you'll be dumb until the baby's born so why didn't he strike Mary I don't know but nothing happened to her she was highly favored she was just like how's this even possible and she had it right I don't even know a man and the angel answered and said to her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore and that Holy thing which shall be born of Thee shall be called The Son of God the Holy Ghost will form that in you Mary don't worry about it you won't have to manufacture it you don't have to work it up it's just going to happen just like you get the Holy Ghost we don't have to stand here work it up beat on the drums and see how loud we get the instruments we don't have to do that to work it up it's just going to happen the holy ghost will form that word in you just like spoken to her you are such a special person Mary God is going to create in you the Son of God hallelujah we are such a special people that God is going to create in us the Mighty God that word that was created us by the spoken word God speaks and things move move we know that when God said let there be light and Adam split I know this ain't very deep maybe brother Jason or brother Matt preach deep stuff on Sunday God will speak to that sickness and it'll be gone oh you're such a highly favored bride he said that I'm going to form in you like I did Mary the word Christ liveing in your heart and I was just going to say be it unto me Lord highly favored BEC in the word ask what you will and it'll be given to you he says Behold thy cousin Elizabeth which has also conceived a son in her old age this is the sixth month which with her who is called Baron don't worry don't worry how it's going to happen for with God nothing shall be impossible what a scripture it's small but it's powerful for with God nothing shall be impossible and Mary says behold the handmade of the Lord be it unto me according to Thy word and the angel departed from her so God quickened Mary's faith and she became the word how's this going to be I don't worry the Holy Ghost is going to be the father that's all Mary needed to know Mary just took the Angel's word for it and said be it unto me according to Thy word not her words or any other man's words but his word that's the way we should be tonight we don't know how it's going to happen whatever you have your need of it don't it may look like it's impossible but it's possible it's going to happen God says I will have a bride she will be bone of my bone she'll be a spotless bride a sinless bride a virgin bride she's a highly favored bride how's it going to happen he knows you know whatever his bride wants all she has to do is ask it oh we've heard the last couple Services if you abide in me my words abide in you ask what you will favored by God if you're abiding him you're favored you're a highly favored woman tonight every person that Bible that had this gift brought brought before them you know what did they do with that gift it's like Noah Noah had a gift God says Hey I want you to build an ark Noah build an arc took him 120 years what saved Noah was death to others God gave us Christ the word and we have accepted it it's life for us but death to them a highly favored woman he has chosen you over the Baptist they don't like to hear that he's chose you over the Catholics over the methodists over all these denominations I said a little while you're special but with that come special privileges we won't go into that that's a whole to totally different sermon this is what makes you a highly favored woman Ephesians chapter 1 verse 2 Grace be to you and peace from God our Father from the Lord Jesus Christ blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings amen that means to be an object of favor or a blessing in Heavenly places in Christ according as he had chosen us as this is election and this election is rigged there's only one name on the ballot Hallelujah and that's you according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the Praises of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted where we heard that before that was a definition of highly favored made accepted means to to Grace UE with special honor to make accepted highly favored he hath made us accepted B says you can go out and love the things of the world wear shorts and do all

already been lavished upon us has a loved gift from our wonderful Heavenly Father the father of our Lord Jesus all because he sees us wrapped in Christ and he chose us to be his very own joining us to himself even before he laid the foundation of the universe because of his great love he ordained us so that we would be seen as holy in his eyes with un stained innocence for it was always in his perfect plan to adopt us as his children through our Union with Jesus the anointed one so that his tremendous love that Cascades over us would glorify his grace for the same love he has for his beloved Jesus he has for us and this unfolding plan brings him great pleasure since we are now joined to Christ and have been given the treasures of redemption by his blood the total cancellation of our sins Hallelujah the total cancellation of our sins all because of his cascading Riches of his grace the super abundant grace is all already powerfully working in us hallelujah it's already working in US releasing within us all forms of wisdom and practical understanding and through the re revelation of the anointed one he unveiled his secret desires to us the hidden Mystery of his long range plan which he had he was delighted to implement from the very beginning of time and because of God's unfailing purpose this detailed plan will reign supreme through every period of time until the Fulfillment of the ages finally reaches his climax when God makes All Things New in Heaven and Earth through Jesus Christ through our Union with Christ we too have been claimed by God by his has his own inheritance before we were even born to he gave us our destiny that we would fulfill the plan of God who always accomplishes every purpose and plan in his heart and I say to you Merry Christmas a
