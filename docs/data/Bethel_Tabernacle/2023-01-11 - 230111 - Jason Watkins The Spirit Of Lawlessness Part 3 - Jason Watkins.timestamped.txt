[21:19] Kings chapter 2 and I hope by the help
[21:23] of the Lord to carry on with my main
[21:26] title on the spirit of lawlessness this
[21:28] will be part three however I would very
[21:31] much like you to bear in mind tonight
[21:33] that I'm taking a subtitle are you ready
[21:38] for this
[21:39] an ordinary man
[21:42] all right praise the Lord let's read
[21:45] second Kings chapter one I I'm sorry
[21:49] um Second Kings chapter I'm sorry excuse
[21:51] me gentlemen First Kings chapter two I
[21:55] think that's what I sent you if it's not
[21:57] that's what we're reading First Kings
[22:00] chapter 2 and verses one through four
[22:04] praise God
[22:07] now the days of David grunai
[22:10] that he should die
[22:12] and he charged Solomon his son saying
[22:16] I go the way of all the Earth
[22:20] be thou strong therefore
[22:22] and show thyself a man
[22:25] and keep the charge of the Lord thy God
[22:28] to walk in his ways to keep his statutes
[22:32] and his Commandments and his judgments
[22:36] and his testimonies as it is written in
[22:40] the law of Moses that thou mayest
[22:43] Prosper so there's going to be a benefit
[22:45] of it see that thou mayest prosper in
[22:49] all that thou doest and withersoever
[22:52] thou turneth thyself so you remember
[22:55] Sunday we were talking about the the
[22:58] principle of compound interest and we
[23:00] were making a spiritual connection you
[23:03] know that if if you start going the way
[23:06] of carnality the compounding interest of
[23:10] carnality will pile up and pile up and
[23:13] pile up and pile up until finally you
[23:16] know one it it it becomes one thing
[23:19] that's not so bad the next thing you
[23:20] know it's sin the next thing you know
[23:22] it's death I could have went there in
[23:23] the New Testament tonight but I'm I
[23:25] decided to start right here on David's
[23:27] deathbed sermon to his son Solomon but
[23:31] in in perfect Contra distinction if you
[23:34] start sowing the word of God in your
[23:37] life that has a compounding interest
[23:39] that will multiply exponentially and
[23:43] here's a beautiful beautiful part you
[23:45] want a good deal
[23:47] it'll multiply itself
[23:49] you don't really have to do anything
[23:50] just start eating on it and it'll start
[23:52] multiplying itself in your life and
[23:55] that's that's really what David is
[23:57] trying to get Solomon he's given Solomon
[24:00] long-range advice
[24:03] see and he's not really he's not you
[24:06] know he's not even touching on the on on
[24:09] things like you know Solomon you know be
[24:11] careful of this enemy and be careful of
[24:13] that enemy and you have to watch out for
[24:15] this in the government watch out for
[24:16] this in politics and here let me give
[24:18] you a lesson I've learned about this in
[24:19] battle and all this David doesn't feel
[24:22] the need on his deathbed to say any of
[24:24] that
[24:27] his only advice Solomon hears all I need
[24:30] you to know
[24:31] keep God's word
[24:33] follow his statutes and he will make
[24:37] sure you prosper as you go along the way
[24:38] and whatever happens don't worry about
[24:40] it because you just keep sowing to the
[24:43] word of God Amen and it's going to
[24:45] compound itself uh and I'm going to tell
[24:48] you something friends say why is that so
[24:49] so much on your heart because that's
[24:52] what we have been doing since 1963 when
[24:56] about five or six hundred people sat on
[24:59] Penn Street in Jeffersonville and heard
[25:01] a prophet with the opening of the seals
[25:04] the most Monumental thing since the days
[25:06] that Jesus and the disciples had walked
[25:09] the Earth the thing the church had
[25:11] waited on for 20 centuries and there's
[25:15] five or six hundred people in a little
[25:17] church that used to be a duck pond a mud
[25:20] just a swamp really and and here we are
[25:23] tonight and it's went around the world
[25:25] and it's found God's children and you're
[25:28] it
[25:29] and we're rejoicing say why are we still
[25:33] here because it's still compounding
[25:35] what what's it going to produce
[25:36] something good
[25:38] amen praise the Lord let's pray father
[25:42] we thank you for your word tonight thank
[25:45] you for this people gathered out in the
[25:47] midweek I'm so glad to be here with them
[25:49] Lord now we commit this to you right
[25:52] readily father we want you just to take
[25:54] it over lord and have your perfect will
[25:57] in your perfect way set human vessel
[25:59] aside Lord may you may you get glory in
[26:04] everything that's said in Jesus name
[26:06] amen God bless you friends you can be
[26:08] seated for I start preaching forget to
[26:10] seat you
[26:12] that's happened before not to me but I
[26:15] know I get a friend of mine who's a
[26:17] preacher and he got to preaching before
[26:19] he set the people down
[26:21] and he's kept going and the next thing
[26:24] you know he'd preached two hours and
[26:25] never set the people down and they
[26:26] respected him so much they just stood
[26:30] it definitely weren't in the South amen
[26:37] amen praise the Lord
[26:42] how many are
[26:44] happy to figure out that at the end of
[26:47] it all when you've done all that's been
[26:50] asked of you you're you're able just to
[26:52] say I was the Lord's unprofitable
[26:55] servant
[26:56] I tell you some friends I I ended with
[26:59] that Sunday and I thought to myself I
[27:01] need to make everybody go back in the
[27:03] church oh I I want to preach a whole
[27:05] sermon the Lord's unprofitable sermon
[27:07] servant because it sounds it sounds like
[27:11] oh man that's too bad unprofitable
[27:13] servant no it's fantastic it's wonderful
[27:17] because it means that all the pressures
[27:19] off of me Jesus Paid It All
[27:22] and all I can do is give my whole self
[27:24] to him and whatever he can use out of it
[27:26] I'll get full credit on the other side
[27:28] not a beautiful thing friends you know
[27:31] as because it you realize as I began to
[27:35] realize that I was always going to be
[27:37] that that I was always going to be that
[27:39] I was never going to be able to do
[27:41] anything and neither was I asked to to
[27:44] think about this you're not even asked
[27:47] to repay the debt Jesus Paid For You
[27:52] he's never even asked you to repay that
[27:54] you couldn't pay it anyway but you've
[27:56] never even been asked to repay that
[27:57] you've only been asked by the Lord to
[28:00] say he's knocking at your heart saying
[28:01] if any man will open I'll come in and
[28:04] then when he comes in he'll start
[28:05] bringing blessings and food and
[28:07] spiritual food in due season thanks sir
[28:09] and and I will sup with him and he with
[28:12] me how many would like to have a meal
[28:13] with the Lord
[28:15] wow and the beauty of it is in the Holy
[28:17] Ghost as we've we've quoted so many
[28:19] times in the in the Bible that you know
[28:22] there the promise of the Holy Ghost in
[28:25] the New Testament one of the great
[28:27] benefits would be that no one's going to
[28:31] have to you know cross the ocean and
[28:33] bring him bring him to us you know in in
[28:36] Jerusalem they had to Journey they had
[28:38] to go to this place they had to go to
[28:40] this place they had to go to this place
[28:41] when the Holy Ghost come he's going to
[28:43] be 90 even in thy mouth you're not going
[28:46] to have to go up to heaven and convince
[28:48] him to come down or cross a sea and
[28:50] bring him back you're not going to have
[28:52] to jump through rings of fire all you
[28:54] have to do is say father
[28:56] and right there that fast that close
[28:59] he's right there on the spot
[29:01] and that is the beauty of the Holy Ghost
[29:05] so we find then when David is coming and
[29:09] he is instructing Solomon
[29:13] it just it's it's moving to me I you
[29:16] know I I can relate to I can relate to
[29:19] Solomon as he's standing here hearing
[29:22] his father giving him these words you
[29:25] know and I mean it's you know and I and
[29:27] I got to experience a little taste of
[29:29] that standing the last time I got to
[29:31] stand at the bedside of my father and he
[29:34] was he was still at right at 80 years
[29:37] old just as sure of this gospel as he's
[29:41] ever been and he's he's admonishing me
[29:44] to press on and everything's gonna be
[29:47] all right it doesn't even matter how
[29:48] this is it's going to be all right and
[29:50] you know what he wasn't wrong it's all
[29:52] right amen and I am I am enjoying the
[29:56] fact that that even on his deathbed he
[29:59] held that confidence and here David is
[30:01] is is so sure of it that he's saying to
[30:05] Solomon you know here's the charge I
[30:08] want to give you Solomon verse two I go
[30:10] the way of all the Earth
[30:12] so now in this sense
[30:17] David is an ordinary man
[30:19] and I guess we all are Ordinary People
[30:23] we're born we live we die
[30:27] and no one's ever escaped it
[30:31] the only people who who that won't ever
[30:34] have to happen to we can look back at
[30:35] Enoch in the Old Testament as a type of
[30:38] a global bride we which are alive and
[30:40] remain I'm glad it says alive and remain
[30:43] because I'm not just alive I'm remaining
[30:47] Hallelujah when the trumpet of God
[30:49] sounds brother Bradham says it like this
[30:51] he says it doesn't matter what happens
[30:53] to this body he says if they if it goes
[30:56] to the Flames if it's eaten by lions if
[30:58] it my ashes are scattered to the Four
[31:00] Winds of the Earth the trumpet will
[31:02] sound and he'll know it's me
[31:05] oh I'll hear that trumpet and I'll come
[31:07] forth and all those elements will come
[31:09] back and nothing can stop it
[31:14] and so so we find that
[31:17] that as or you know this is I suppose
[31:20] that this is what
[31:22] connects all Humanity
[31:25] is that we are all born and we're aging
[31:31] toward an end
[31:33] and the only and that's what made Jesus
[31:36] so unique as brother Branham said there
[31:39] there had been many great men
[31:43] and moreover there had been many great
[31:46] men who died for a great cause
[31:50] he says but there had never been a man
[31:54] who could lay his own life down no one
[31:57] could take it from him he surrendered it
[31:59] and then that same person not a
[32:02] different person that same person could
[32:05] pick himself raise his self back up from
[32:08] the grave again that had never been
[32:10] happened had never happened Adam tried
[32:12] that Adam Adam stepped into sin to save
[32:16] Eve the problem of the first Adam was
[32:19] when he stepped into sin he got hung
[32:22] himself
[32:23] and he couldn't get back out but when
[32:25] the second Adam stepped in he stepped
[32:28] back out and then pulled his family out
[32:30] with him
[32:31] Hallelujah do you feel the pool tonight
[32:33] I've been pulled
[32:36] from certain death and now it's so
[32:38] certain I can never die
[32:42] it doesn't even matter what becomes of
[32:44] this body
[32:45] the trumpet will sound and he'll know
[32:47] it's me
[32:48] see and I'll raise as we were saying
[32:50] Sunday I'll come up with the same
[32:53] character I go down with that's why
[32:56] Resurrection morning holds no fear for
[33:00] me because I understand that principle
[33:03] that that if I die in the next minutes
[33:07] I'll come back up with the same love for
[33:11] God that I have right now
[33:14] I'll have the same Faith burning in my
[33:16] heart so it so then it really doesn't
[33:19] matter so then I'm really not an
[33:21] ordinary man
[33:24] I'm something
[33:26] more
[33:27] hahaha
[33:32] brother Branham says in possessing the
[33:34] enemy's Gates this is a this is just
[33:36] burned on my heart ever since brother
[33:38] Matt Smith
[33:40] talked about these Gates and it's just
[33:42] such a beautiful thought that he brought
[33:43] there and I just thought man I'm never
[33:45] going to let Satan you know they tried
[33:47] to shut Samson in that wasn't going to
[33:49] work
[33:51] my
[33:52] was it brother Caleb just talking about
[33:54] that recently
[33:56] brother Branham says possessing the
[33:58] enemy's Gates whatever you desire
[34:02] ask in my name
[34:04] and it shall be given you he's
[34:06] paraphrasing Christ in the scriptures
[34:10] a little while
[34:11] now watch out brother Ram says this a
[34:14] little while
[34:15] and the world now you already know the
[34:18] end will not see me but you'll see me
[34:21] but brother Brandon's gonna stick a
[34:24] little
[34:24] a little description in here
[34:27] a little while and the world
[34:30] the not seed
[34:35] the unregenerated
[34:38] seed see everybody has a seed of life
[34:42] nobody can god holds this Mystery of
[34:45] Life he's the only one who can give life
[34:47] so everybody everybody really is alive
[34:51] just like I was preaching and and I
[34:54] preached it here before and I've
[34:55] preached it uh in other places around
[34:57] the world
[34:58] how that man was made in the image of
[35:00] God
[35:01] and therefore that's what a man is is a
[35:04] man living after the image of his maker
[35:06] and I've said and I say that to young
[35:08] men especially how that manhood is not a
[35:11] gender it's an office you might be a
[35:13] male that doesn't mean you are ever will
[35:15] be a man
[35:16] because manhood be it speaks character
[35:19] and integrity and honesty and decency
[35:22] and morality
[35:24] man because he's made in the image of
[35:26] God that's a man see and so that's why
[35:29] brother Randall would say I've seen men
[35:31] six foot you know men 200 pounds and
[35:34] they didn't have even one ounce of man
[35:36] in them
[35:37] right so so this is the beauty of what
[35:40] the word of God does it makes it makes
[35:43] you know and that's why it says God
[35:46] breathed into his nostrils the breath of
[35:49] life and he became a living soul
[35:53] as we've showed you in the Hebrew it
[35:54] means he became praying dirt
[35:57] he's built out of the dirt he's building
[35:59] in the animal kingdom as the highest
[36:01] order but he's the only one of all that
[36:04] Animal Kingdom that turns and prays no
[36:07] other animals do that so so now he's at
[36:11] a higher order he's building the image
[36:12] of God and as he's as he's living in the
[36:17] image of God this is what makes him uh
[36:20] really this is what makes him a human
[36:24] say If he if he's if he doesn't what
[36:28] makes him live according to the word of
[36:30] God the Holy Ghost what's that the life
[36:32] of God where's it at in you living
[36:34] through you
[36:36] well so if you don't have that are you
[36:37] not a human well Peter said you're a
[36:40] brute Beast
[36:44] so yeah I suppose you're Homo Sapien
[36:46] you're you're above the chimpanzee I get
[36:49] it
[36:50] I I understand that but you're still
[36:52] just in the Beast order
[36:54] you've not become because the human was
[36:58] a living Soul he he had breathed into
[37:00] him the breath of life and he became in
[37:02] the image of God's light and sin he now
[37:06] when sin comes that is marred brother
[37:08] Branham said sin come in and Mart his
[37:11] picture but here's the Catch You Came
[37:13] anyway but you were lost so then God
[37:16] comes in the sinful in the uh like
[37:19] sinful man he comes down in Christ and
[37:21] takes all the sin upon himself and he
[37:23] who knew no sin became sin and God
[37:27] judged him that's what a prophet said
[37:29] God judged him as a sinner
[37:31] and sent him to hell so you and I would
[37:35] never have to go that's the gospel
[37:39] say what's the gospel good news that God
[37:41] so loved the world he gave his only
[37:44] begotten son
[37:47] to take the penalty of sin and death and
[37:50] be sent to hell so you and I would never
[37:52] have to go so if a man goes to hell he
[37:55] sends himself there
[37:57] because he simply refused the provision
[37:59] that God made for him not to have to do
[38:01] that hell wasn't even built for humans
[38:03] it was built for the devil and his
[38:04] angels
[38:06] but the Bible says because it had to
[38:08] take in humans now hell the Bible says
[38:10] Hell hath enlarged itself
[38:12] see
[38:13] and so so we realized that this whole
[38:16] time now when we're when we're coming
[38:18] down to say well are you uh are you an
[38:22] ordinary human well I am in one sense an
[38:25] ordinary human
[38:27] I'm kin to all the human race
[38:29] I was born the exact same way
[38:32] that all humans are born if the Lord
[38:35] tarries I my life will end the same way
[38:38] as David said I go the way of all the
[38:40] Earth
[38:42] but we realize that when when God began
[38:46] to break the word to us in the end time
[38:49] we found out that the thinking in the
[38:52] ages had just always made it seem like
[38:55] that men would just whoever could make
[38:57] the choice to serve God
[39:00] then then then then then they became a
[39:02] son of God
[39:04] but we found out once the seals were
[39:06] open and all the mystery in the Mighty
[39:08] God was unveiled now wait a minute we
[39:10] found out it's it's it's more than that
[39:12] that it it's actually Jesus said
[39:15] concerning his family you having
[39:18] actually chosen me I've chosen you and
[39:21] you were chosen in me before the
[39:22] foundation of the world and you didn't
[39:24] become a son at an altar you only found
[39:26] out you had always been and by the Holy
[39:29] Ghost you're now cooperating in the
[39:31] vision
[39:33] no wonder I want to serve God no wonder
[39:36] I like coming to church because this
[39:38] body is being brought subject to the
[39:41] vision
[39:42] that's why that's how Jesus said for us
[39:45] to pray that as it is in heaven so let
[39:49] it be in the Earth
[39:51] see because that's first
[39:54] remember he said to Moses
[39:56] make the Tabernacle when you build this
[39:58] Tabernacle make sure you build it
[40:01] exactly like the one you saw in heaven
[40:04] don't deviate not even one ringlet
[40:07] different
[40:09] and you say man that's a lot of pressure
[40:10] on Moses well it's not because prophets
[40:13] brother random explain that that a
[40:15] prophet has an ability that when he sees
[40:18] a vision he can see it again forever
[40:21] it's like permanently photographed in
[40:23] his brain
[40:24] and and and so when he saw it in heaven
[40:27] there was no doubt he could reproduce it
[40:29] in the earth and then not only that God
[40:31] even gave him Blueprints and the
[40:33] blueprints made sense to the image that
[40:35] he had when he was there
[40:38] oh I'm so glad God has somebody called a
[40:41] prophet Hallelujah
[40:44] because this is an hour of such
[40:46] uncertainty we needed a sure voice
[40:53] so he says here
[40:56] whatever you desire asking my name and
[40:57] it shall be given to you a little while
[40:59] in the world the not seed the
[41:01] unregenerated seed so now he's not
[41:03] saying they're not human they don't have
[41:04] a seed of life
[41:06] simply he goes and he breaks the analogy
[41:08] he breaks down the analogy to say look a
[41:12] hen can lay an egg
[41:15] but if that if the hen has not been with
[41:17] the rooster and the egg's not fertilized
[41:19] it'll never hatch into a chick
[41:23] see and so it's one thing to have the
[41:27] seed of life it's another thing to have
[41:29] a germ of eternal life
[41:31] that is placed in you the day you were
[41:33] born
[41:34] because you say why was it placed to me
[41:36] the day I was born because that's the
[41:38] day you started out in time in the Earth
[41:40] as a human but you had always been in
[41:42] the mind of God and what happened is is
[41:45] that followed you here
[41:48] you understand it wasn't like God came
[41:50] down and did a micro surgery and said if
[41:52] they could get a strong enough
[41:53] microscope they could find it somewhere
[41:55] down it's not that kind of a seed it's
[41:57] what I once followed me here
[42:00] because I'm just extended into this time
[42:02] Hallelujah
[42:04] no wonder Jesus could say I come from
[42:07] God I go back to God
[42:13] rich in Mercy
[42:15] gives the whole world a legit
[42:17] opportunity to save themselves
[42:20] see
[42:22] it's it's a legitimate chance he gave it
[42:25] to everybody he'd be unjust to not but
[42:28] when it comes to this elect lady as John
[42:30] would call her it's all it's a whole
[42:32] different set of rules
[42:33] it's a whole different plan it's a whole
[42:36] different section in The Book of Life
[42:39] brother M used that word section it's
[42:41] the lamb section it's a it's a section
[42:43] of election see and so so we find out
[42:47] then that that that it's a it's all
[42:50] those names are in there and and when
[42:53] they get to the judgment
[42:55] really there's only one question that
[42:57] has to be answered is my name still
[42:59] there has it been blotted out
[43:02] say what about the bride she does she
[43:04] doesn't come to that Judgment at all
[43:05] she's Seated on the throne with Christ
[43:08] see
[43:09] because all her sins done went ahead of
[43:11] her and were met in Jesus see so when
[43:14] she gets there she's already been judged
[43:15] she's not going to suffer Double
[43:16] Jeopardy she's already been judged in
[43:18] Christ how did that happen because she
[43:21] allowed this to dominate her life
[43:24] and and this made her not ordinary this
[43:27] made her extraordinary
[43:29] are we shorting the word to
[43:31] extraordinary the bridge shorten it even
[43:33] more to extraordinary
[43:37] extraordinary
[43:39] it means you're extraordinary
[43:42] that you know you're not you're not
[43:43] you're not and and why is that because
[43:46] what look at what brother Brown said
[43:48] concerning when he's talking about the
[43:50] humanity of Jesus and he goes back to
[43:52] Solomon and he says just like Solomon
[43:54] was the son of David so David's in the
[43:57] fatherhood Solomon's in the sonship and
[43:59] and so he says that's the way Jesus was
[44:01] he says accept
[44:03] Solomon was just a man
[44:08] see he's a mere man
[44:10] he says but Jesus was a man plus I love
[44:15] that a man plus
[44:17] see he won and then he comes right
[44:19] behind he says he was the god man that's
[44:23] what made him the Prototype that's why
[44:26] he's a brand new type of human he's the
[44:29] beginning of the creation of God and
[44:32] there's a whole Kingdom coming behind it
[44:34] who are the continuation
[44:37] of that same creation
[44:40] say what kind of creation was it a
[44:42] spoken word
[44:45] say well well when do I get it you
[44:47] already got it if you're born again
[44:49] a Cycle's already started we got a
[44:51] Rapture in cycle shout voice trumpet why
[44:54] should you think that your your
[44:56] translation is any different it comes
[44:57] into your soul it makes you and your
[44:59] Soul's already in Heavenly places with
[45:01] Christ Jesus
[45:03] this body this mind this this this this
[45:06] it's still stuck here but it doesn't
[45:08] even matter this body could lay down and
[45:10] die today but the trumpet will sound a
[45:13] trumpet six thousand years you talk
[45:16] about compound interest
[45:19] this trumpet has been compounding
[45:21] interest for six thousand years ready to
[45:24] blow
[45:26] yeah it's gonna bring all the dead of
[45:30] all the New Testament era
[45:32] he's going to bring them all up say
[45:34] that's going to be one more trumpet this
[45:36] thing's got compounding in
[45:42] again since then
[45:44] see don't you worry it'll get you home
[45:48] this message has already put you on the
[45:51] road
[45:52] and it's already from glory to glory
[45:55] he's changing me
[45:59] I find then that I'm I'm an ordinary man
[46:02] yet I'm not ordinary
[46:05] I'm a seed that was fertilized with life
[46:08] before the foundation of the heavens and
[46:10] the Earth before the heavens and the
[46:12] Earth were even formed
[46:15] I've been quickened by the Holy Ghost
[46:18] therefore I the real me
[46:21] Am Alive forevermore
[46:24] so I thought Jesus said that he said it
[46:28] so you can say it
[46:29] behold I live forevermore you ought to
[46:33] just let the devil hear that come off
[46:34] your lips you're going to just raise up
[46:36] those hands and say because he lives I
[46:38] live forevermore because of that day on
[46:41] Calvary I live forevermore I I'm immune
[46:44] from prosecution I'm not subject to the
[46:47] devil anymore he can't force me to do
[46:49] anything
[46:50] I have power I've been given power over
[46:53] scorpions and serpents and over all the
[46:55] power of the enemy
[46:59] Hedonism refers to a family of
[47:04] theories all of which have and there's a
[47:06] number of them not going to bore you
[47:07] with the psychology of it all
[47:10] that because they all have uh one really
[47:14] they all have in common that pleasure
[47:18] plays a central role in them so they
[47:21] have psychological or motivational
[47:24] Hedonism they have
[47:26] um wow some of these words would even be
[47:29] hard for me to pronounce and so they
[47:31] have an ethical normative and ethical
[47:33] Hedonism and and they have a axiological
[47:36] Hedonism and and and it just the the the
[47:40] it goes on and on and on it goes where
[47:42] it stops nobody knows and so they even
[47:45] have a folk Hedonism oh boy
[47:48] but but really
[47:50] it's a it's a philosophical position in
[47:54] generally speaking
[47:56] in that
[47:58] happiness
[48:00] is is pursued and accomplished in this
[48:04] theory of thinking if this is how you
[48:06] think
[48:07] that happiness
[48:10] is the pursuit of pleasure
[48:12] and the running away from pain
[48:17] so so that's how they measure happiness
[48:20] that becomes the pursuit in fact is of
[48:24] everything they do think and say of
[48:26] everything they plan and dream and stage
[48:28] and and posture for and and they raise
[48:31] their kids to try to think like that
[48:33] that you you should you here's here's a
[48:36] great philosophy of Life Chase pleasure
[48:40] and avoid pain
[48:43] at all costs avoid anything negative and
[48:46] just Chase fun
[48:49] and you would be you'd be shocked at how
[48:53] pervasive that theory is
[48:57] especially among the intellectual Elite
[49:01] who disdained the idea
[49:04] that character only comes from suffering
[49:09] see that this was this was Dr Spock you
[49:13] know back in the 60s and 70s when he
[49:15] started you know changing the culture
[49:17] and you know don't don't discipline your
[49:20] children with whippings anymore you know
[49:23] don't don't use a corporal punishment
[49:25] and I forget the wording he used uh
[49:28] uh I thought of it today and but I I
[49:31] don't think of it often but it was it
[49:34] was all it was all it was it was all
[49:35] about denial and reward rather than
[49:38] rather than punishment and correction
[49:42] it's all about denial just deny them
[49:45] something
[49:46] don't actually whip them just deny them
[49:49] and then if they
[49:52] if they don't act bad then throw all
[49:55] kinds of gifts on them
[49:57] and it literally
[49:59] in the course of just a few decades
[50:01] ruined an entire generation
[50:06] and how did how did he
[50:10] get to that theory and how did a nation
[50:13] follow him in Mass they first had to
[50:16] disregard this
[50:18] now they shouldn't have done that
[50:21] because this is the owner's manual
[50:26] does the manufacturers
[50:29] Playbook
[50:30] you understand so this is your b-i-b-l-e
[50:34] they got a song like that I think we
[50:36] sing that in Sunday school and it's
[50:38] basic uh instruction before leaving
[50:40] Earth
[50:42] amen
[50:44] so and it's full of principles it's not
[50:46] just full of stories and histories and
[50:47] doctrines and teachings it's full of
[50:50] principles that aren't a lot of times
[50:52] they're not necessarily doctrines just
[50:54] like I said earlier when I said manhood
[50:57] is an office that's a principle that's
[51:00] not a Doctrine that's a principle you
[51:02] understand so there's principles like
[51:05] you know we we coin phrases you know
[51:08] that if you uh how how's the old saying
[51:12] go if you do this you spoil the child I
[51:14] forget now it's escaping my mind but
[51:16] spare the right there you go thank you
[51:18] spare the rod my son's going how did you
[51:21] forget that
[51:23] [Laughter]
[51:25] but if you spare the club I mean spare
[51:28] the rod you spoil the child
[51:32] brother Eddie never used a rod or a club
[51:34] he picked up whatever was closest to it
[51:38] it might be the mailbox chucked up out
[51:40] of the ground
[51:41] you just didn't know
[51:45] but whatever he did worked amen
[51:48] you know and so whenever whenever he
[51:50] didn't want to do anything he turned the
[51:52] assault off hurricane loose on us and
[51:54] sister Gene could give you 40 lashes
[51:56] before you could say wait mom
[52:01] amen that's a true story
[52:05] and so I'm I but I today stand thankful
[52:08] for every one of them
[52:10] ever last one of them I couldn't
[52:11] understand as a child you know that she
[52:13] would say I've gotta I gotta think down
[52:15] the road if I don't get this stop now
[52:16] what will this become see she understood
[52:19] compounding sin
[52:21] she understood that that compound
[52:23] interest in sin it might be this might
[52:26] be a small thing now the punishment
[52:28] might seem much worse than the crime but
[52:30] Mom's not looking she's looking at the
[52:31] compound
[52:32] I see what this will become I got to
[52:34] make sure I get it eliminated while
[52:36] while I can get it eliminated so
[52:39] and so so we find then that
[52:42] that this whole idea
[52:44] of just Chase
[52:46] fun Chase pleasure whatever way you can
[52:50] find pleasure and avoid sin
[52:54] you know I I was looking today and I
[52:58] I try not to get too wrapped up in it
[53:02] because I can get very melancholy
[53:04] watching it
[53:06] with a love for history and I go back
[53:08] and I I study history and I was looking
[53:11] today at the history of the Third Reich
[53:13] and you know it just caused me to again
[53:16] once again for the umpteenth time in my
[53:19] life as a student of History uh it
[53:22] caused me again to see the futility
[53:26] of every Tyrant or every strong man who
[53:28] ever lived who tried to dominate
[53:30] his fellow man through tyranny
[53:33] through oppression
[53:35] and none of them were ever true they if
[53:39] you go back and look at them all they
[53:40] started out with all these ideals and
[53:42] ideological oh it sounds like this guy's
[53:45] going to build a Utopia I mean that the
[53:48] whole reason they were trying to
[53:50] assassinate Lenin was because he
[53:53] betrayed the revolution
[53:55] and and the whole thing was now was
[53:57] supposed to actually bring freedom
[53:59] brought more tyranny than the monarch he
[54:01] had than the Imperial Czar had done and
[54:04] so all these people and all these young
[54:06] people are now disillusioned and the
[54:08] young woman takes a gun and tries to gun
[54:10] him down shoots three times he he
[54:13] survived but he was never healthy again
[54:14] never normal again ended up having a
[54:16] stroke and dying so she got him you know
[54:19] with kind of the the long shot and and
[54:22] so you know and they how many times they
[54:24] tried to assassinate Adolf Hitler and
[54:26] and all all kinds of tyrants if you look
[54:29] at the history they all had to worry
[54:31] about assassins
[54:33] and many of them did get taken out by
[54:37] people close to them you know we you
[54:39] know
[54:40] Shakespeare wrote a lot about that and
[54:42] that was the kind of a day that he lived
[54:45] in because you know everybody's gunning
[54:47] for the top guy and so the whole thing
[54:50] is sinful
[54:51] nobody nobody had if you if you look at
[54:55] Society they they were talking about how
[54:58] that I remember brother Branham said you
[55:00] know I went to see the remains of this
[55:03] great Monarch and those guys my
[55:06] arrogance was uh their arrogance was
[55:10] Indescribable and they just would kill
[55:13] people just for no reason no okay I
[55:15] think you should die today why I don't
[55:17] just I just don't like you go die and
[55:19] they would and then people would die by
[55:21] the by the tens of thousands genocide
[55:22] genocide is considered a phenomenon
[55:26] which means they really can't fully
[55:28] explain it it's like they know it
[55:30] shouldn't be what is it that makes man
[55:32] turn on fellow man and commit the most
[55:35] horrific almost Indescribable I was
[55:38] watching today a testimony of a young
[55:41] woman who was seven 16 17 and 18 and she
[55:44] was at Auschwitz she survived her and
[55:46] her mother with just sheer tenacity my
[55:48] goodness those two ladies were amazing
[55:51] and uh
[55:53] and and she was just she was it was the
[55:55] most detail I had ever heard she went
[55:57] back to visit had a hard time walking
[55:58] back to it she's got her oldest son and
[56:00] she's giving him details and and they
[56:02] killed your grandfather and grandmother
[56:04] here and here's where all your
[56:06] aunts and uncles died and your cousins
[56:08] and all of our town folk in our school
[56:10] my school Chums and I was the only
[56:12] Survivor and and you know and and so and
[56:16] and I just thought to myself you know
[56:18] how is it as brother Branham said when
[56:21] you go to look at what they've
[56:23] accomplished you have to dig down into
[56:25] the Earth
[56:26] to even find their Dusty old broken down
[56:30] remains
[56:32] and I mean you couldn't stand there in
[56:34] their presence and say Hey you know you
[56:37] dummy you don't even realize there's a
[56:40] God above you and you're nothing and
[56:42] then about 2 000 years they're going to
[56:45] have to dig down in the sand to even
[56:46] find your throne where you sit now or
[56:49] you would have killed you immediately
[56:50] for saying it but you'd have been right
[56:53] they they you know how many of them
[56:55] perished all of them
[56:58] you know how many ordinary men die all
[57:00] of them
[57:01] you know how many extraordinary family
[57:03] of God died none of them
[57:06] Hallelujah
[57:07] so you got something to live for you're
[57:09] not ordinary you're extraordinary you're
[57:12] part of the family of God you got a gene
[57:14] of the heavenly father down inside you
[57:16] and they're not going to have to come
[57:18] after Armageddon and dig down for my
[57:20] remains I'll walk out on the top of the
[57:22] ashes of it
[57:24] Hallelujah
[57:28] all men come to the same place
[57:31] and their wives get laid beside them and
[57:34] I was looking you know at the the whole
[57:36] dichotomy you know that was John Kennedy
[57:39] and and then after he died and then you
[57:41] know he's got a baby that's died and
[57:43] then finally Jackie O dies and they bury
[57:45] her beside him and then John Jr dies and
[57:47] it's all part of Prophecy
[57:51] where the Bible was going to take the
[57:53] name of Ahab out of existence
[57:56] and even and even talks about I remember
[57:58] when John Kennedy Jr
[58:00] you know crashed his plane with his wife
[58:03] and a friend into the ocean and
[58:06] you know when you go back to see The
[58:09] Offspring of Ahab and you look at his
[58:11] family and you see the mark because
[58:14] brother Brown talks he he took those at
[58:17] John Kennedy for to correlate Ahab and
[58:20] The Jezebel system behind him not Jackie
[58:23] but Rome
[58:24] but but Jackie was the one who had the
[58:28] connection from from Paris to Hollywood
[58:30] and and the and the whole nonsense and
[58:34] vulgarity became pervasive here
[58:37] until everybody had to have church women
[58:40] Pastors in churches wanted a hairstyle
[58:42] like Jackie Onassis like Jacqueline
[58:45] Kennedy and brother Branham talks about
[58:47] the correlations listen when a prophet
[58:49] connects those dots that's not an
[58:51] accident
[58:54] and when you go and you look at how
[58:57] and how John dies and how John Jr dies
[59:00] and you go back to the Bible and you
[59:03] look at the Heritage and the Bible says
[59:05] of him he sank down in his chariot
[59:12] he sat down
[59:14] in his chair both of them sank down in
[59:17] the Chariot they were riding in
[59:19] God is Not mocked
[59:22] there's never been a prophecy that
[59:24] hasn't come to pass to the latter
[59:27] it goes unnoticed by the world and even
[59:29] if it's noticed it's not cared about
[59:31] thank God you care
[59:34] thank God we care I care about the word
[59:38] I care about principles
[59:41] see so so since death then you know it's
[59:44] why we said here some some time ago
[59:46] Chris and I were talking about that on
[59:49] our church workout day where we were
[59:51] saying what's the point of life if you
[59:54] fail to gain eternal life
[59:56] I mean what's the real point you live
[59:57] you pay taxes you die
[59:59] you're probably sick about a third of
[1:00:01] the time and oppressed another third of
[1:00:03] the time and and and and whatever's left
[1:00:05] it's probably a make a man born of a
[1:00:08] woman is just a few days and full of
[1:00:09] trouble
[1:00:10] full of trouble
[1:00:13] see
[1:00:14] and you don't have to be alive very long
[1:00:16] to understand that
[1:00:19] that real life is not fair
[1:00:22] and it can be very very depressing you
[1:00:27] know if if enough things Daisy chained
[1:00:29] together that really just
[1:00:32] just steals all hope from you
[1:00:35] when people lose hope
[1:00:37] and and I just thought to myself wow you
[1:00:41] know he's saying you're not an ordinary
[1:00:42] no I'm not ordinary
[1:00:44] because I don't even I don't even mourn
[1:00:48] for the dead as others do
[1:00:51] I have a hope in Christ
[1:00:54] it doesn't say you know it doesn't say
[1:00:56] that I'm not sad at the loss but but I
[1:00:59] but I don't do it like the world does I
[1:01:01] got an extra measure I have a hope of
[1:01:03] the resurrection and I really believe
[1:01:04] that that's part of my whole psyche it's
[1:01:07] not just something I that I I think is
[1:01:09] true and I'm trying to make myself
[1:01:11] believe it no it's it's even more than
[1:01:13] Faith it's me it's part of me
[1:01:18] so I'm I I'm No Ordinary man
[1:01:22] I have the life of the Resurrection
[1:01:25] within me so I really am actually Death
[1:01:27] Proof
[1:01:28] and so I I really have only one purpose
[1:01:31] friends you say what is your brother
[1:01:33] Jason if you could name your greatest if
[1:01:36] you like David
[1:01:38] and and somebody said to you on your
[1:01:41] deathbed what what has been your
[1:01:44] greatest purpose in life I I would have
[1:01:46] all the things you know to say to my
[1:01:48] sons and to my grandchildren that my dad
[1:01:50] said to me that that a prophet said to
[1:01:53] him and said to me but but if you if the
[1:01:56] question is what would you consider
[1:01:59] your greatest goal in life and I would
[1:02:02] say everything else pales by far in
[1:02:07] comparison to a single goal that on that
[1:02:10] day I'll stand with those in the Book of
[1:02:12] Revelation and they stood around the
[1:02:14] throne and lived in an innumerable
[1:02:16] number lifted up praises and glory and
[1:02:20] stood around the throne I'll be around
[1:02:22] the Throne of my Creator that's my goal
[1:02:26] everything else is subservient to that
[1:02:29] every mode of every objective every plan
[1:02:32] short term midterm long-term every
[1:02:34] investment I make the whole compounding
[1:02:36] of my life is to get me there around
[1:02:39] that throne
[1:02:41] Hallelujah
[1:02:45] and so it's interesting I I was watching
[1:02:49] um
[1:02:50] you know some of the testimonies of them
[1:02:52] and
[1:02:53] the the generation today you know they
[1:02:56] have questions of that generation there
[1:02:59] that went along with Hitler like that
[1:03:00] and how could you have done it and the
[1:03:02] the children were caught up in it and
[1:03:04] the teenagers caught up in it and the
[1:03:06] old the middle age and the old and the
[1:03:07] elderly and everybody was just drunk
[1:03:11] with genocidal thoughts
[1:03:14] and of course it wasn't every single one
[1:03:18] of them there's great stories of heroism
[1:03:22] among the German people who did not
[1:03:25] agree with it and hit Jews and connived
[1:03:28] again committed treasonous acts against
[1:03:30] their own government because they they
[1:03:32] considered God a higher government
[1:03:34] and I believe God will have a place for
[1:03:36] them
[1:03:37] Hallelujah and I don't even know what
[1:03:39] denomination they might have been but
[1:03:40] I'm here to tell you blessed are the
[1:03:42] merciful for they shall obtain Mercy
[1:03:45] amen God will not forget that he has a
[1:03:49] book of remembrance of remembrance
[1:03:51] and but but in general generally
[1:03:54] speaking and they they have a question
[1:03:56] and
[1:03:57] you know they they ask one of the and he
[1:03:59] had been one of the Hitler's kids
[1:04:02] you know
[1:04:03] and they they're asking him and he says
[1:04:05] well you know he says
[1:04:07] I I can't answer and he says all I can
[1:04:10] tell you is
[1:04:11] it was a very
[1:04:13] terrible
[1:04:14] time
[1:04:16] he says it was a horrible time
[1:04:19] and here's an old man struggling to try
[1:04:22] to put into words how are you going to
[1:04:25] how do you account for what happened
[1:04:28] you were there please help this
[1:04:30] generation to understand that generation
[1:04:33] but yet that generation is no different
[1:04:36] than the then the then the uh
[1:04:41] the the uh the the terrible terrorism
[1:04:44] that we have today where they walk into
[1:04:46] crowded markets and blow up innocent
[1:04:48] people
[1:04:49] it's all ideology
[1:04:52] see it's all you can't you can't believe
[1:04:54] what ideology can make you do
[1:04:57] and and the and and to the world
[1:05:00] they don't understand how your ideology
[1:05:02] makes you live the way you live how do
[1:05:05] you live like that you're weird you're a
[1:05:07] cult no we're not
[1:05:09] how could I be weird or a cult when I
[1:05:12] espouse everything that's virtuous
[1:05:14] and everything that's just and
[1:05:16] everything that's decent and everything
[1:05:17] that's honest
[1:05:19] the only the only reason you look at me
[1:05:21] like that is because you're insane
[1:05:24] and not today I stand on the principles
[1:05:27] that the church has always stood on
[1:05:33] and so you know they they they actually
[1:05:36] had a panel of experts I'm going to try
[1:05:37] to stop a little early if I can they had
[1:05:40] a panel of experts doctor this and
[1:05:41] doctor that and doctor this and Dr that
[1:05:43] fine that's good
[1:05:44] but but they're going to try to answer
[1:05:46] this genocide this phenomenon
[1:05:49] and I I listened to them for quite a
[1:05:52] little while I didn't just give it a
[1:05:54] small
[1:05:55] listen I actually set for
[1:05:57] probably two or three hours just today
[1:06:00] going over these testimonies trying to
[1:06:02] get my mind wrapped around what their
[1:06:05] thinking is
[1:06:07] and the thing that I can tell you this
[1:06:09] the thing that left me astonished the
[1:06:12] most
[1:06:13] is how easy I answered the questions
[1:06:17] how quickly the answers to me were
[1:06:20] immediately obvious
[1:06:22] and they have to have an hour and a half
[1:06:25] to go through these long drawn out
[1:06:28] conflicted the whole thing was so jacked
[1:06:30] up by the time they got it done they
[1:06:32] didn't even know who was what and who
[1:06:33] was on First and what was on second
[1:06:35] no one knew who's on third and
[1:06:38] and you know they they they're they're
[1:06:40] they're trying to to figure this out and
[1:06:44] you know they got all these
[1:06:46] psychological theories they had three
[1:06:49] questions here was their three questions
[1:06:50] they were only trying to answer three
[1:06:52] questions
[1:06:53] at a big Summit here's all kinds of
[1:06:55] people
[1:06:56] we're only going to try to answer three
[1:06:58] questions we have the most imminent
[1:06:59] experts on our platform and we're going
[1:07:02] to take on these three perplexing
[1:07:03] questions that everybody seems to want
[1:07:05] to know why are some attracted to
[1:07:09] hateful and extreme ideologies
[1:07:13] so as soon as I heard that question I
[1:07:16] mean I mean of course of course the
[1:07:18] answer must begin with the you know with
[1:07:20] the overarching what the Bible calls the
[1:07:22] cruelty of sin
[1:07:25] that that accounts for a lot of it
[1:07:26] there's a lot of things in the world
[1:07:28] that seem so horrible and you just say
[1:07:31] and then the people want to blame God
[1:07:32] and they say to a Christian or preacher
[1:07:34] said how how did how does this happen if
[1:07:37] there's a God and I just simply say God
[1:07:39] doesn't do it it's the cruelty of sin
[1:07:41] let's get that first let's get that
[1:07:43] straight when God built the Earth it
[1:07:44] didn't have none of that
[1:07:46] you see and when it whenever a nation
[1:07:48] was keeping his his Commandments they
[1:07:50] didn't act like that
[1:07:52] and so so that's where it starts but but
[1:07:55] a really a more direct answer which is
[1:07:57] what they were looking for Why are some
[1:08:00] attracted to hateful and extreme
[1:08:02] ideologies and I just thought to myself
[1:08:04] you know that that it's because of the
[1:08:07] Fallen nature of man who's born in sin
[1:08:10] he's a brood Beast
[1:08:13] how about we start with that
[1:08:16] that never even near the end of the
[1:08:18] discussion
[1:08:19] that's not even part of the equation
[1:08:22] their brute Beast trying to figure out
[1:08:25] why other brewed beasts act like Brew
[1:08:27] beasts
[1:08:29] and nobody thinks to look in the mirror
[1:08:32] of God's word and go the enemy is me
[1:08:35] and and and and if I was converted and
[1:08:37] if Hitler had got the Holy Ghost he
[1:08:39] wouldn't have acted that way and it
[1:08:41] wouldn't have mattered what kind of
[1:08:42] childhood he had
[1:08:44] it wouldn't have mattered who his
[1:08:46] mentors were once the Holy Ghost comes
[1:08:48] in in five seconds you're a brand new
[1:08:50] creation in Christ Jesus
[1:08:53] all things are passed away and All
[1:08:55] Things become new
[1:08:58] see
[1:09:00] they had a second question why are
[1:09:02] others willing now this is I thought
[1:09:04] this was amazing why are others willing
[1:09:07] to take extraordinary risks to help
[1:09:09] neighbors or even people they don't know
[1:09:11] and they're that there's they they were
[1:09:13] doing that some Germans were committing
[1:09:16] treasonous acts and hiding people
[1:09:18] sometimes they get caught and then they
[1:09:20] get killed with them
[1:09:22] and and you and you had you know and and
[1:09:25] I thought so what what makes others
[1:09:28] willing to take extraordinary risk to
[1:09:31] help neighbors or even people they don't
[1:09:33] know well first of all we're going to
[1:09:34] start with that all humankind is created
[1:09:37] in the image of God and and and make
[1:09:40] decisions there's going to be an unwise
[1:09:43] virgin who are Sanctified Saints who are
[1:09:46] righteous people who aren't even born
[1:09:48] again of the Holy Ghost
[1:09:51] there there are people in the world who
[1:09:53] are going to gain eternal life because
[1:09:55] of a Kind deed they did and were a
[1:09:58] benefit to God's family
[1:10:00] say well how did they get so lucky they
[1:10:03] weren't lucky it's obvious that from
[1:10:05] some point in their life they started
[1:10:07] making decisions about good and
[1:10:09] compounding interest paid off
[1:10:13] that's not hard for me to figure out
[1:10:16] maybe many maybe some of them have the
[1:10:18] Holy Ghost who are born again and that's
[1:10:19] why they did it but maybe not all of
[1:10:21] them were but even even good people let
[1:10:23] me tell you some friends there's going
[1:10:24] to be Heaven is going to be thrown with
[1:10:28] millions of people who are not part of
[1:10:31] the Bride the bride lives in the Royal
[1:10:33] City
[1:10:34] but the whole world will be filled with
[1:10:36] nations of people who make decisions to
[1:10:40] refuse deep evil from a very young age
[1:10:43] and it just kept compounding and they
[1:10:45] grew up
[1:10:46] and became a decent human being
[1:10:50] I'm not talking about good old boys
[1:10:51] getting to Heaven not that's not what
[1:10:53] I'm suggesting but old boys generally
[1:10:55] don't get to heaven
[1:10:57] see
[1:10:59] because we're not talking about you know
[1:11:01] kind good-natured people who are just
[1:11:04] easy going and get drunk but they're
[1:11:06] still easy going I'm not talking about
[1:11:08] that I'm talking about people who built
[1:11:11] in the image of God know that right is
[1:11:14] right and wrong is wrong
[1:11:18] and God will have a place for him he
[1:11:19] absolutely will
[1:11:21] so compounding
[1:11:24] you know that it's so compounding here
[1:11:27] here what I was talking about at the
[1:11:29] beginning this compounding thing it's so
[1:11:31] compounding to people
[1:11:32] that they will not only risk their lives
[1:11:34] and did they'll knowingly risk their
[1:11:37] lives of their family then children if
[1:11:39] they get caught they're all gonna die
[1:11:42] so don't underestimate the power of
[1:11:44] compound goodness
[1:11:47] do good
[1:11:49] the Bible says that it's a direct
[1:11:50] commandment do good do that which is
[1:11:53] right in the sight of God for four
[1:11:55] thousand years people did right who
[1:11:57] weren't born again
[1:11:59] they didn't have the Holy Ghost the Holy
[1:12:00] Ghost wasn't given
[1:12:02] you understand but for 4 000 years
[1:12:04] for for fourth for I mean I mean Here
[1:12:07] Comes abimelech he's not even in
[1:12:10] Abraham's family he'll never be in
[1:12:11] Abraham's family he's not going to be
[1:12:13] part of the elected but he's not down
[1:12:15] there in Sodom
[1:12:17] and he's a noble King and he's he he
[1:12:20] prays and God talks to him
[1:12:23] and he's never gonna he's never going to
[1:12:24] understand who is who this Melchizedek
[1:12:26] was
[1:12:27] God there's no Covenant promise to to
[1:12:29] him but God spares him
[1:12:32] and cause him a a a righteous man
[1:12:35] I'm telling you something friends just
[1:12:38] remember that's why that's why I say to
[1:12:40] a lot of people sometimes you say I
[1:12:41] can't win them to the message well
[1:12:43] that's that's that's his election
[1:12:46] I mean that's that's the election that's
[1:12:48] the seed Gene is there or it's not that
[1:12:51] doesn't mean that that you can't lead
[1:12:52] them to Christ and they could find
[1:12:54] Heaven A Heavenly home that's going to
[1:12:56] happen to millions of people
[1:12:58] so always look to do good and always
[1:13:01] look to witness and and always you're
[1:13:04] going to try to fish for it to see if
[1:13:06] maybe a gene seed is laying there but if
[1:13:08] it's not tell them about the love of God
[1:13:10] and what he's done to you
[1:13:13] see
[1:13:15] so so we find then that that that you
[1:13:20] know that compounding good then becomes
[1:13:22] really becomes a bulwark against
[1:13:24] compounding evil
[1:13:26] and I mean that might be true in the
[1:13:29] that you could have I mean some of those
[1:13:31] German people had that evil family the
[1:13:33] next door to them or across the street
[1:13:34] so you just never know where you're
[1:13:37] going to encounter evil but that's why
[1:13:39] Jesus that Jesus was so strange to the
[1:13:42] Jews because they had never heard of a
[1:13:45] rabbi saying that that if someone steals
[1:13:48] your coat give him your cloak also
[1:13:51] and he they're hearing Jesus they'd
[1:13:54] always heard the the other Pharisees say
[1:13:57] it's an eye for an eye and a tooth for a
[1:13:59] tooth and they had to have Sanctuary
[1:14:00] cities and people had to run for their
[1:14:02] lives
[1:14:03] and Jesus said but I say unto you
[1:14:06] forgive
[1:14:08] and do good to them which evenly
[1:14:10] mistreat you
[1:14:12] if you only do good to those who are
[1:14:14] good to you then what makes you
[1:14:16] different from a sinner
[1:14:19] see so so being a Christian is
[1:14:22] extraordinary
[1:14:24] you understand you're an extraordinary
[1:14:26] person the third question was why do
[1:14:29] societies fall that's probably the
[1:14:31] easiest one of all why have they always
[1:14:33] fallen that's what they should have
[1:14:34] asked
[1:14:36] you know I can look back as a student of
[1:14:38] history and they've always felt always
[1:14:40] and the thing that got him was because
[1:14:42] the sinful mind is enmity against God
[1:14:45] and can never agree with God and it's
[1:14:47] always going to choose evil and it
[1:14:48] always has and so the mind of Christ is
[1:14:51] passed on it's passed on an overwhelming
[1:14:54] majority especially among the
[1:14:55] intellectual Elite and they espouse the
[1:14:57] sin and perversions that are against
[1:14:59] God's word
[1:15:01] ah instead of the life principles that
[1:15:04] it teaches brother Brandon says this and
[1:15:05] I'm going to stop I'm going to close
[1:15:06] with this
[1:15:08] because here's what I want here's what I
[1:15:10] want to position myself for next time
[1:15:14] brother Brown says in the message one in
[1:15:17] a million not tremendous message brother
[1:15:20] Bradham comes with a Pulpit three
[1:15:21] different times
[1:15:22] he comes up and it's like little short
[1:15:24] 15-20 minute
[1:15:26] sermons then somehow I'm not sure what's
[1:15:28] going on I think it maybe it's because
[1:15:29] of the radio they had radio slots and
[1:15:32] then they go off the air then okay
[1:15:33] brother Benham come back and he comes
[1:15:34] back up again finally says okay this is
[1:15:36] my third time up here and uh but the
[1:15:39] people are still pulling but he says
[1:15:41] here in the very first of the three
[1:15:43] segments
[1:15:45] he says speaking of God he is supposed
[1:15:47] to according to the scriptures
[1:15:50] Return To Us in this last days in this
[1:15:53] type of ministry that will be after the
[1:15:56] baptism now watch he's going to go back
[1:15:58] to Azusa the the most recent Revival he
[1:16:01] says that will be this ministry that's
[1:16:04] coming
[1:16:05] that will be after the baptism of the
[1:16:08] spirit and speaking in tongues and
[1:16:10] Divine Healing and so forth these things
[1:16:12] the capping of the Pentecostal message
[1:16:16] is what we're speaking of today so
[1:16:19] you're taught well in this we don't when
[1:16:21] we say we're looking for the capping
[1:16:23] that's not at the neglect of the of what
[1:16:26] built to it
[1:16:28] but neither do we cabbage on on the
[1:16:30] building blocks we want to come to the
[1:16:32] completion
[1:16:33] you understand so we take all of it and
[1:16:35] we bring it all together in balance and
[1:16:37] harmony
[1:16:39] and so he and but but here's here's the
[1:16:42] real takeaway that the Azusa Revival was
[1:16:46] never going to be able to put a bride in
[1:16:48] a rapture
[1:16:50] and it was the and it was the last great
[1:16:52] gasp
[1:16:54] of the ages it was the last best thing
[1:16:57] and it was the it was the hail Mary and
[1:17:00] they they threw it and it landed and it
[1:17:03] was a great Revival and within months
[1:17:04] Satan was already dividing them they
[1:17:06] were already starting to denominate
[1:17:07] they're already starting to split up
[1:17:08] here and split up there and by the time
[1:17:10] brother Branham even got around them
[1:17:11] they were already so they were already
[1:17:12] as divided as we Baptists were
[1:17:16] and he spends all these years trying to
[1:17:17] get them together brothers were one
[1:17:19] where one were one until they finally
[1:17:20] just shut their doors because he won't
[1:17:22] side with this one he won't side with
[1:17:23] that and he said I've stood between him
[1:17:25] and tried to say we're one and nobody
[1:17:27] wanted to hear that
[1:17:29] and so
[1:17:30] the age closes out as as God's dealing
[1:17:34] with the church because the church comes
[1:17:36] to a point where and this is what a
[1:17:38] prophet taught us she is no longer the
[1:17:41] mouthpiece of God
[1:17:43] she had been through the ages but she
[1:17:46] reaches a point where she's no longer
[1:17:47] the mouthpiece of God she's kicked
[1:17:49] Christ out
[1:17:50] she's no longer the mouthpiece of God
[1:17:52] she brother Adam says she's her own
[1:17:54] mouthpiece and God will confound her
[1:17:57] through the prophet and the bride
[1:18:00] amen and that's why a bride under her
[1:18:02] Prophet is the final Voice or the final
[1:18:04] demonstration the last will and
[1:18:07] testament the last image that God is
[1:18:08] proving to a world of what it means to
[1:18:11] be extraordinary of what it means to be
[1:18:14] an elect of what it means to be back to
[1:18:16] the original like the original family
[1:18:21] so he says the capping of the
[1:18:23] Pentecostal message is what we're
[1:18:25] speaking of today this ministry of
[1:18:27] Christ now watch this this is a mouthful
[1:18:30] you ready to you ready to feel
[1:18:32] extraordinary
[1:18:36] this ministry the one he's speaking of
[1:18:39] this ministry of Christ himself
[1:18:42] impersonated among his people
[1:18:45] with the very same things that he did
[1:18:47] when he was here on Earth in his body
[1:18:50] the bride which is part of him doing the
[1:18:53] same things as husband and wife or King
[1:18:57] and Queen just before the marriage
[1:19:00] ceremony
[1:19:04] this can't be ordinary people
[1:19:09] what I just read to you
[1:19:12] can't be ordinary people
[1:19:15] yeah it's got to be ordinary plus thanks
[1:19:17] Mike
[1:19:18] he goes on now watch this I'm going to
[1:19:21] read you these two two paragraphs then
[1:19:22] we're gonna we're gonna
[1:19:24] hit the brakes pull the shoot and jump
[1:19:26] out
[1:19:27] this week
[1:19:29] the Lord willing
[1:19:31] I wish to speak on some of that out in
[1:19:33] our campaign here
[1:19:34] to kind of get acquainted he says the
[1:19:36] time and the hour that we're living
[1:19:38] if a person don't know now follow me
[1:19:41] close if a person don't know which way
[1:19:43] to go
[1:19:45] what to do
[1:19:46] or how to turn
[1:19:48] you're not walking by faith anymore
[1:19:51] that's easy I get that you get that
[1:19:54] if you if you don't know which way to go
[1:19:57] and what to do if if all the events of
[1:20:00] the world are leaving you bewildered and
[1:20:02] you don't know you don't know how am I
[1:20:05] supposed to be a Christian what do I do
[1:20:06] I see what's happening in the government
[1:20:08] what's happening in socialism what's
[1:20:09] happening in education what's happening
[1:20:10] in science what's happening in the earth
[1:20:12] I see what's happening and you know what
[1:20:14] do I do what do I do what I do the whole
[1:20:15] world the whole world is doing that
[1:20:18] they're they're going in circles trying
[1:20:20] to figure it all out they're not
[1:20:22] operating in faith they're running in
[1:20:23] fear but that's not for you
[1:20:25] that's for ordinary people who who have
[1:20:28] not uh given the time they should have
[1:20:31] given to God's instructions but to you
[1:20:33] who have loved his appearing
[1:20:35] you're supposed to be operating by faith
[1:20:40] see
[1:20:42] now watch he's gonna it's gonna get
[1:20:43] worse
[1:20:44] then you're not walking by faith anymore
[1:20:46] you're just guessing you're presuming
[1:20:47] presume is to advance without official
[1:20:49] Authority
[1:20:50] now here's a real question so if we
[1:20:53] haven't got
[1:20:55] the real official authority to know what
[1:20:58] God Said would take place in this hour
[1:21:01] how are we ever going to face this hour
[1:21:06] read it again if we haven't got the real
[1:21:09] official Authority in other words thus
[1:21:12] saith the Lord on the word to know thus
[1:21:15] saith the Lord no question no guessing
[1:21:18] this is what it is that's what the seven
[1:21:20] seal is doing this is what the message
[1:21:22] is this is the people it's calling
[1:21:24] see if you don't have an authoritative
[1:21:27] an official Authority if you don't have
[1:21:29] an authoritative
[1:21:31] word on that then then the world you're
[1:21:35] and here and here's what makes it worse
[1:21:37] if we if we haven't got the real
[1:21:39] official authority to know what God Said
[1:21:41] would take place in this hour in other
[1:21:42] words if we don't have thus saith the
[1:21:43] Lord then how are we ever going to face
[1:21:45] this hour here it is and we've got to
[1:21:48] face it
[1:21:50] I mean I'd like to give you a pass and
[1:21:52] say don't worry if you don't get it you
[1:21:53] just you just get a pass you want to
[1:21:55] face it no
[1:21:56] you're facing it every day you were
[1:21:58] facing it when you woke up this morning
[1:22:00] you're gonna face it tomorrow your
[1:22:01] children are facing it
[1:22:03] and so I ask you tonight where where are
[1:22:05] you getting your Authority from oh I
[1:22:08] hope you're not getting it from
[1:22:09] intellectualism I hope it's a fire
[1:22:12] breathing experience of the Holy Ghost
[1:22:14] that'll not only ratify and vindicate
[1:22:17] this message but it'll it'll migrate it
[1:22:19] from text behind skin and it'll make you
[1:22:22] a living word in the hour
[1:22:25] and that's how you will face it
[1:22:28] we've got to face it knowing by faith in
[1:22:31] his word the things that's supposed to
[1:22:33] be happening now here's the here's the
[1:22:35] here's three he names the condition of
[1:22:37] the Nations the condition of the people
[1:22:39] the condition of the church
[1:22:41] and so forth
[1:22:43] we've got to know that last paragraph
[1:22:45] we've got to know that
[1:22:48] and then how to walk out to face it if
[1:22:51] you don't know how to do that
[1:22:55] you're just what we used to call kind of
[1:22:57] haphazardly just jump in hoping it'll be
[1:23:01] here hoping this and hoping that and
[1:23:04] will it be but God don't love this
[1:23:08] Kentucky word God don't want us to do
[1:23:12] that
[1:23:14] could I say to you tonight in a
[1:23:15] hillbilly way God don't want us to do
[1:23:17] that
[1:23:19] he doesn't want you unsure
[1:23:22] he want he doesn't want you to see
[1:23:24] yourself as ordinary
[1:23:26] he wants you to not only see yourself as
[1:23:28] extraordinary but he wants you to take
[1:23:31] on the responsibility of what that
[1:23:33] entails and that is a life totally
[1:23:36] surrendered to God so that you become a
[1:23:39] North star to someone looking to find
[1:23:41] life that you become a guy you become a
[1:23:44] life to a dark world
[1:23:46] see
[1:23:48] we've got to know that
[1:23:50] we've got to know how to walk out to
[1:23:52] face it if you don't know how that
[1:23:53] you're just haphazardly see God don't
[1:23:56] want us to do that he wants us to know
[1:23:58] what he said about this day and then
[1:24:01] meet it by faith because he said it
[1:24:03] would be that way then we know your
[1:24:04] truth then because you haven't got some
[1:24:07] person's word for it you've got his word
[1:24:09] of what we must do and we're we're
[1:24:12] hoping that our heavenly father will
[1:24:15] grant this to us this week
[1:24:19] I'm here to tell you something friends
[1:24:22] every gate that held my soul from a sin
[1:24:26] Birth has been opened

[1:25:39] only one desire and my whole battle my
[1:25:42] greatest battle every fault and that I'm
[1:25:44] fighting is to bring my mind and my body
[1:25:47] my hands and my ears and my eyes subject
[1:25:51] to what's already happened within me and
[1:25:54] has made me an extraordinary person

[1:26:30] it's near sounding do you believe that
[1:26:34] it's near to sounding once and for all
[1:26:36] no I'm not an ordinary man and we are
[1:26:39] not an ordinary people
[1:26:42] stand up all you extraordinary
[1:26:45] people of God
[1:26:47] who God has loved in an extraordinary
[1:26:50] way
[1:26:51] who has sent you an extraordinary word
[1:26:55] so that you can do extraordinary things
[1:26:58] in the last day the people who know
[1:27:01] their God are going to have that kind of
[1:27:03] a lifestyle
[1:27:05] they're going to do amazing
[1:27:06] extraordinary things things you know
[1:27:09] when you do something like that it's
[1:27:12] beyond you it's some it's some extra
[1:27:15] measure that you wouldn't have normally
[1:27:16] been able to do but somehow men have had
[1:27:21] tremendous heroics but like like brother
[1:27:23] Bradham said many good men died and many
[1:27:26] good men died for even a good cause
[1:27:29] but still
[1:27:30] they died like ordinary men
[1:27:33] and if they didn't die ready to meet God
[1:27:37] they went where all ordinary men who
[1:27:39] aren't ready to meet God go when they
[1:27:41] die
[1:27:42] say where is that where they all go
[1:27:44] why what's the common denominator they
[1:27:47] didn't know God in the opportunity God
[1:27:50] gave them life and a way to know God and
[1:27:53] that God made it so clear that even all
[1:27:55] they had to do was acknowledge Him in
[1:27:57] nature
[1:27:58] and not be a heathen and not worship the
[1:28:01] creation more than the Creator
[1:28:03] and have enough because and the whole
[1:28:05] reason for that was not because that
[1:28:09] heathenism
[1:28:11] didn't start out because of a lack of
[1:28:14] understanding it started out as a choice
[1:28:17] that when they knew God they chose not
[1:28:22] to worship him as God and they made to
[1:28:26] themselves four-footed creatures and
[1:28:28] reptiles and birds and all kinds of
[1:28:30] statues but there was a time when they
[1:28:32] knew God
[1:28:34] and they chose not to have they chose to
[1:28:37] just be ordinary people
[1:28:40] not me
[1:28:41] not me no no no way no way
[1:28:45] I am not here to be an ordinary man and
[1:28:49] go to the ordinary place where all
[1:28:50] ordinary Godless people go I'm gonna
[1:28:53] I've got a whole new world waiting on me
[1:28:55] I have made up my mind I have made up my
[1:28:59] mind I started with Jesus and I'm going
[1:29:02] through I'm going all the way I'm not
[1:29:05] sidetracking I'm certainly not backing
[1:29:07] up I'm not even going to stand still
[1:29:09] because if you stand still you start
[1:29:10] backsliding because the world's like a
[1:29:13] treadmill it's in motion constantly and
[1:29:14] if you stop progressing you'll start
[1:29:16] declining
[1:29:19] see you can't you can't do that you
[1:29:21] gotta you gotta constantly press toward
[1:29:23] this Mark Press means strain means
[1:29:26] stretch means reach see amen I can't go
[1:29:29] any further if I do I'll be in next time
[1:29:32] material we're going to have uh Brother
[1:29:35] Scott Smith with us this coming weekend
[1:29:37] and we're having our service that's
[1:29:41] going to be a it's going to be a regular
[1:29:42] service but it's going to have a theme
[1:29:44] as a memorial to sister Jan Hall and uh
[1:29:48] for those of you who may not know her as
[1:29:51] good as some of the other other of us
[1:29:53] other more charter members do Brother
[1:29:56] Gary and sister Jan we're with us back
[1:29:57] in the A-frame they were uh they were
[1:30:00] probably
[1:30:02] and the kernel is probably second only
[1:30:04] to Mike and Wanda as far as who's been
[1:30:05] around the longest I think Mike and
[1:30:07] wonder we're ahead of them I'm pretty
[1:30:09] sure that you're already in the church
[1:30:10] before they got there
[1:30:11] same time yeah okay
[1:30:14] yeah that's right yeah Rich and Rosalina
[1:30:17] that's right praise the Lord
[1:30:18] so we're going to uh and brother Charles
[1:30:21] God bless you don't let me forget
[1:30:22] brother Charles amen so we we want to do
[1:30:26] that this weekend and we're gonna we're
[1:30:28] gonna run up there won't be any Sunday
[1:30:29] School classes we're going to start up
[1:30:31] straight away
[1:30:33] um
[1:30:34] at 11.
[1:30:36] I will probably have the church open by
[1:30:39] about you know by 10 30 maybe 10 40. you
[1:30:43] can come in it'll be just like normal
[1:30:45] and we'll have some music playing and
[1:30:47] then we're going to start with just an
[1:30:49] abbreviated
[1:30:51] song service maybe one or two songs and
[1:30:53] then I'm going to take it from there and
[1:30:55] I'm going to kind of give a little bit
[1:30:56] of what I wanted to say I wasn't given
[1:30:59] the opportunity at her funeral so I'll
[1:31:01] get a chance at her Memorial and then
[1:31:03] the family also is going to have some
[1:31:06] things they want to read and say and
[1:31:08] they're going to have a slideshow so
[1:31:11] we're going to schedule all that out and
[1:31:12] then
[1:31:13] and then we're going to uh have Brother
[1:31:15] Scott come out so so it won't it's not
[1:31:18] going to be some long drawn out thing
[1:31:19] we'll we'll be able to get everything
[1:31:21] done uh probably in about 40 minutes
[1:31:24] before Brother Scott is turned loose and
[1:31:27] that's pretty normal our Sunday mornings
[1:31:29] usually go about 35-40 minutes before I
[1:31:30] get going and so that it'll kind of run
[1:31:33] like a normal thing and then brother
[1:31:35] Scott will maybe take a few minutes
[1:31:37] maybe he thought maybe 10 or so minutes
[1:31:39] and finish up some comments he didn't
[1:31:41] have enough time for at the funeral and
[1:31:44] then he's just going to throw down and
[1:31:46] preach he's going to just say what he
[1:31:47] wants to about says Jan and then he's
[1:31:48] going to preach the sermon and so it'll
[1:31:50] kind of run a normal course and when we
[1:31:52] dismiss we'll have we're going to have a
[1:31:54] big church full-blown dinner and uh and
[1:31:57] it kind of be in honor of the family
