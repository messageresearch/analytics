[0:00] We
[0:01] are we're changing the subject, but
[0:04] we're not changing the subject.
[0:09] So, we're we're we're moving on from
[0:12] entitling it a word
[0:14] family. Um, and we're going to go into
[0:17] courtship and marriage and start over
[0:20] again at part
[0:23] one. And we'll stand and read the
[0:26] scripture.
[0:32] Proverbs 31:10, "Who can find a virtuous
[0:35] woman? For her price is far above
[0:41] rubies." Proverbs 31:30, "Favor is
[0:44] deceitful and beauty is vain, but a
[0:46] woman that fears the Lord, she shall be
[0:49] praised." And then on to
[0:52] Psalms 12:1. Help, Lord, for the godly
[0:56] man ceaseth. For the faithful fail from
[0:59] among the children of
[1:01] men. They speak vanity everyone with his
[1:04] neighbor with flattering lips and with a
[1:05] double heart do they speak. The Lord
[1:09] shall cut off all flattering lips and
[1:12] the tongue that speaks proud things.
[1:14] Let's pray. Heavenly Father, we just
[1:17] come before you, Lord, and we ask that
[1:18] your spirit would be with us as we go
[1:20] into your word. That you would you would
[1:23] take your word and and teach us and
[1:25] write it upon our hearts, Lord.
[1:27] give us uh your your vision, your
[1:30] wisdom, your revelation of yourself. We
[1:33] commit our time to you in Jesus name.
[1:36] Amen. You can be seated.
[1:41] So as we look at the
[1:43] scripture, we
[1:46] understand both a virtuous and godly
[1:50] woman is a rare thing and a and a godly
[1:55] man is also a rare thing. And as we as
[2:00] we look and see at these verses, you can
[2:05] understand charm is deceitful.
[2:08] So, uh, Proverbs spends a lot of time
[2:12] speaking about what a what a real lady
[2:16] is, what a real godly lady is. And as
[2:19] you look at this, it speaks a lot about
[2:22] charm. It speaks about being loud. It
[2:24] speaks about being boisterous. Speaks
[2:26] about being aggressive. And this isn't
[2:29] the kind of characteristics for a godly
[2:32] young woman. Amen.
[2:35] The real thing that is important is
[2:39] character. A woman that fears the
[2:42] Lord, she's the one that will be
[2:45] praised. Beauty is vain, charm is
[2:48] deceitful. Beauty
[2:50] uh lasts only so long.
[2:55] And just as you find from different
[2:58] stories in the scripture, you know, a
[3:01] man can be enchanted with a a woman's
[3:05] looks and the and he can deceive her,
[3:08] thinking of Amnan and his halfsister. He
[3:13] can be so charmed with her and want her
[3:15] so badly and then the minute that he
[3:18] violates her, turns and hates her. So
[3:21] the beauty lasts only so long. The charm
[3:24] lasts only so long, but a woman that
[3:25] fears the
[3:27] Lord. She's the one to look for. And
[3:29] then as you look at this for young
[3:31] ladies looking for a young man, we
[3:35] understand we can we can put this as a a
[3:38] prayer for a young lady. Help Lord
[3:42] for the godly man
[3:44] ceases. The faithful fail from among the
[3:47] children of men. and how critical it is
[3:49] to look for some for a a young man that
[3:51] is
[3:53] faithful, a young man that
[3:56] has godly or Christlike character. This
[4:01] is the first priority when you're
[4:03] looking for a man. Christlike character.
[4:06] Not someone that he just speaks things.
[4:09] He makes promises. He flatters you. He
[4:12] says all the right things. But what what
[4:14] is his actual life speak? How what's his
[4:16] relationship with his mother, with his
[4:18] sisters? How does he treat them? You
[4:21] know, how is he consistent with his
[4:24] life? Is he is he you know, we look in
[4:27] the Bible and we hear different we read
[4:28] different things. We think of how this
[4:30] applies back to oursel, but think about
[4:32] what kind as a young lady, what kind of
[4:35] man do you want to marry? Yeah. Do you
[4:37] want to you want to marry Nebuchadnezzar
[4:40] or
[4:41] Belshazzar? Men who are you say, "Oh,
[4:43] no. That's terrible."
[4:45] Well, many of young women do and their
[4:48] life is marked by that. Handsome to the
[4:50] looks, has the money, has all the things
[4:52] that you think are important, but no
[4:56] consistency. Oh, this God, this thing
[4:58] over here, over there. Oh, my advisers
[5:01] say this, I should do this. Or someone
[5:03] like Daniel who says, I'm going to serve
[5:05] God no matter what. I'm going to stand
[5:07] for the truth even if it costs me my
[5:09] life. I'm going to be I'm going to live
[5:12] with integrity and be consistent. It
[5:14] didn't matter if Daniel was um a nobody
[5:18] or if he was the prime minister
[5:20] and whether he was in Babylon or whether
[5:23] he was in Persia, who the emperor was,
[5:26] what it was, he Daniel was, he knew who
[5:29] he was and he was faithful. That's the
[5:32] kind of young man that you want to look
[5:34] for. Amen.
[5:42] Amen. in the choosing of a bride. We're
[5:45] going to read quite a number of quotes
[5:47] from this
[5:49] uh
[5:51] message. If a man marries a sex queen,
[5:53] you see what he's looking for for the
[5:56] future. If a man marries a woman that
[5:59] won't stay
[6:00] home, you see what he's looking for in
[6:03] the future. See, and that's the thing is
[6:06] many times in the midst of of the world,
[6:10] the worldly system of dating, you're not
[6:14] thinking of the future. You're thinking
[6:16] of what's fun right now, what's
[6:17] enjoyable right now, this guy's cute,
[6:20] this guy flatters me, this except for
[6:23] that's that's so
[6:25] stupid. You can't be more of an idiot if
[6:28] you're thinking about just what's fun
[6:30] right now.
[6:32] You have to understand you're planting
[6:34] seeds with every choice and every
[6:36] decision and every person that you let
[6:38] into your life. You're you're planting
[6:41] seeds of what's going to grow for the
[6:42] future. We we like to think I'm strong.
[6:44] I'm powerful. I'm impervious of the
[6:47] influence of others. No, you're not. And
[6:49] especially if you think that, you're
[6:51] especially not impervious to the
[6:53] influence of others. Amen.
[6:56] And so understand, look at the big
[6:58] picture.
[7:00] Don't be in the emotion and the feeling
[7:02] of the moment when you're looking at
[7:04] decisions for your
[7:07] future. What kind of father do you want
[7:10] for your children? What kind of mother
[7:13] do you want for your children? What kind
[7:15] of life do you want to create at
[7:17] home? You'll you you you may not
[7:21] understand as a young person, how can I
[7:24] tell? How can I understand? Ask somebody
[7:26] once. Ask your pastor.
[7:29] Ask your mom and dad. Don't just go by
[7:33] the emotion of what makes you feel
[7:37] good. Paragraph 69. This sounds awful. I
[7:40] just feel to say it and I usually if I
[7:42] feel to say the thing, I have to say it
[7:44] and it's usually God's
[7:45] way. I used to go with a rancher that I
[7:48] work with to buy cattle and I noticed
[7:49] the old fella always looking right in
[7:51] the face of a heer before he went to
[7:53] bidding. Then he turned her head and
[7:55] looked back and forth. I followed him
[7:57] along, watched him, and he looked her up
[7:58] and down. If she looked all right, the
[8:00] stature, then he turned and looked her
[8:02] in the face. And sometimes he'd shake
[8:03] his head and walk away. Said, "Jeff, I
[8:06] want to ask you something." He said,
[8:07] "Say on, Bill." I said, "Why you always
[8:09] look that cow in the face?" I said, "She
[8:11] looks all right. A good good heavy
[8:15] cow." Said, "I want to tell you, boy,
[8:17] you got a long a lot to learn." And I
[8:19] realized it after he told me. He said,
[8:21] "I don't care how she's made up. She
[8:23] might be beef plum to the hoof, but if
[8:26] she's got that wild stare in her face,
[8:27] don't you never buy her. Said, why so,
[8:31] Jeff? Well, said the first thing is said
[8:34] she'll never stay put. Said next thing
[8:36] is she'll never be a mammy to her calf.
[8:39] And said they put her in a pen now. The
[8:41] reason she's fat, you turn her loose
[8:42] with that wild stair, she'd run herself
[8:44] to death. I said, you know, I kind of
[8:46] learned something. I believe that
[8:48] applies to women, too. Right. Right.
[8:50] That wild, scary ricketta look. Better
[8:53] stay away from her boy. All that there
[8:55] blue stuff over a top her eyes. Wouldn't
[8:57] want that. I don't think that's becoming
[8:59] to a Christian. I don't care how much
[9:01] the television paper says it's pretty.
[9:04] It's the most horrible looking hideous
[9:06] sight that I ever seen in my life.
[9:10] Amen. So again, I think I think we can
[9:13] take the same principle and apply it the
[9:16] opposite way as well. you know, don't
[9:19] don't just look at the outward
[9:23] appearance, you know, if if God if if in
[9:28] choosing David to be king, God says man
[9:31] looks at the outward appearance, but the
[9:34] Lord looks at the heart. So, if we have
[9:37] the Holy Spirit, if we're Christians, if
[9:40] we're in a Christian family, we can also
[9:43] look at the heart as well. We don't have
[9:45] to be limited merely to the outward. He
[9:47] looks the part. He's he's uh he's got
[9:50] all the message terminology down. He's
[9:52] got all I mean there's been many uh
[9:55] people that have just looked at
[9:57] externals and given their daughters to
[10:00] horrible people that have destroyed
[10:02] their lives. So don't just look at the
[10:05] externals. Look at the character of the
[10:07] life. Look at the family as a whole.
[10:10] We've got to stop going based upon the
[10:13] world's definitions and the world's
[10:14] standards because they will not lead you
[10:17] in the right
[10:18] direction. You might get lucky, but
[10:21] we're not it we're not living to get
[10:22] lucky. We're living to follow the
[10:24] leadership of the
[10:27] Lord. Again, choosing of a bride,
[10:29] paragraph 60. Could you imagine a
[10:31] Christian doing a thing like that? No
[10:33] sir, I could not. A true Christian will
[10:36] not look for such beauty queens and
[10:39] chorus girls and sex queens. He'll look
[10:41] for Christian
[10:43] character. Now, you can't have all
[10:45] things. There might be one girl that's
[10:46] real pretty and the other maybe she's
[10:48] her stature looks better than this one.
[10:50] And you might have to sacrifice one for
[10:52] the other. But if she's not the stature
[10:53] of a lady of a woman and she's I don't
[10:56] care whether she's pretty or not, you
[10:58] better look at her character whether
[10:59] she's pretty or not. Not pretty. Now,
[11:03] for it is becoming, if a Christian would
[11:04] choose a wife, he ought to choose a
[11:06] genuine bornagain woman, regardless of
[11:09] what she looks like. It's what she is,
[11:11] what makes her. And then again, that
[11:13] reflects his own godly character and
[11:15] reflects what's in his mind and what's
[11:17] going to be in the future. For his
[11:19] family will be raised by such a woman
[11:22] for the future plans for his home. If he
[11:25] marries one of these little modern
[11:27] Ricetta sex queens, what could he
[11:28] expect? What kind of a home could a man
[11:30] expect to have? If he marries a girl
[11:33] that ain't got enough moral about her to
[11:34] stay home and take care of a house and
[11:36] wants to work out in somebody's office,
[11:38] what kind of a housekeeper will she be?
[11:41] You'll have babysitters and everything
[11:42] else. It's true. Now, I'm not much of
[11:45] this modernistic taste of women working.
[11:48] When I seen these women with these
[11:49] uniforms on riding around in this city
[11:51] on motorcycles as police, it's a
[11:54] disgrace to any city that will let a
[11:55] woman do that. See? See?
[12:00] as many men that's without work. It
[12:02] shows the modern thinking of our city.
[12:04] It shows the the degrading. We don't
[12:07] have to have them out them women out
[12:09] there like that. They ain't got no
[12:11] business out there like that.
[12:14] When God gave a man a wife, he gave him
[12:16] the best thing he could give him outside
[12:18] of salvation. But when one goes to
[12:20] trying to take a man's place, then she's
[12:23] about the worst thing that he could get
[12:25] a hold of. Now, that's right. See?
[12:30] Amen. It's it's incredible to see. This
[12:33] is such a very simple and elementary
[12:36] thing that brother Brandham said. And
[12:37] we've I I don't want to belabor the
[12:40] point. I know I know there's lots of
[12:42] different situations and lots of
[12:43] different circumstances, but again, we
[12:46] start from the word of God. We don't
[12:47] build our lives upon the response to
[12:50] what our fears are, the response to what
[12:52] we think might happen. We first go based
[12:55] on the principle of God's word. What's
[12:56] the principle of God's word? A woman is
[12:59] to be prepared and made ready to be a
[13:03] keeper of the home. This is the vision.
[13:06] Brother Brandham rebukes anything
[13:08] outside of that and says, "Why would you
[13:10] want a woman that's pursuing a
[13:12] career? Why would you choose that?
[13:15] You'll have babysitters and and the the
[13:17] the the family will be going every which
[13:21] direction. You say, "What about this and
[13:23] what about that?" Okay, what about this
[13:24] and what about that? But the reality is
[13:27] what is our vision first as parents
[13:29] because you understand our kids are
[13:32] getting a vision put over them on them
[13:34] not just by the church by you what
[13:37] vision you're presenting them what
[13:39] direction you're bringing them what
[13:41] scriptures you're showing them we we we
[13:45] just whether you teach them or not
[13:48] you're teaching them
[13:50] and be sure that your vision is
[13:52] according to the word of God. It might
[13:54] be the hard way. It might be the
[13:55] difficult way. It might seem
[13:58] impossible. You might have doubts and
[14:00] you might have fears. But I I believe
[14:02] that if we will order oursel first by
[14:05] what the word
[14:07] says and walk by faith in what the word
[14:10] says, God will meet and provide for
[14:12] every need. Many times we try to take it
[14:15] into our own hands, take our life into
[14:18] our own hands. And that's where we make
[14:20] our great mistake. Amen.
[14:25] In in fact, isn't that the very root of
[14:30] pride? And it's the very root of what
[14:33] Satan wants for man. You take your life
[14:36] into your own hands. You make your plan.
[14:39] You find your way. You find your own
[14:41] purpose. That's exactly what the devil
[14:44] wants you to
[14:45] do. Why do we want to find our own way
[14:47] and our own purpose instead of finding
[14:50] God's way and God's purpose? And we know
[14:53] for first before anything, there's no
[14:55] leadership of the Holy Spirit that takes
[14:57] us outside of the Bible. So if you say,
[15:00] "I feel led to do something and it's
[15:02] contrary to scripture." No, you may feel
[15:04] led to do it, but it's not a leading
[15:06] from God. Amen. That's that's
[15:09] primary. All we s search our motives and
[15:12] objective objectives and our whole heart
[15:14] by the
[15:18] word. And that's especially key when it
[15:22] comes to courtship and marriage when
[15:25] we're we're that's that's the primary
[15:28] thing following the leadership of the
[15:29] Lord understanding discernment. Now
[15:32] again there's a couple things you can
[15:34] become so naturalistic in your approach
[15:37] to marriage that you don't even seek the
[15:40] will of the Lord. You just go by how you
[15:42] feel about this person. Right? But then
[15:45] you can also become so spiritualistic. I
[15:48] had a dream. This person is my that thus
[15:50] sayeth the Lord. This girl is my wife.
[15:52] And she's like, I that I don't like you.
[15:54] You're a
[15:55] weirdo. But you're not following the
[15:57] leadership of the Lord. I'm going to
[15:59] probably I'm probably call that person
[16:01] out and say, I think you're I think
[16:03] you're weird,
[16:04] too. God works through circumstances and
[16:08] decisions and even the desires of our
[16:10] heart. We have to check those desires
[16:13] and motives, the things that are in us
[16:15] with the with the with the word.
[16:19] It's critically important because our
[16:22] what is wrong with our heart? Should we
[16:24] follow our heart? That's Disney's
[16:26] message to us. That's the message we've
[16:28] unwittingly taken from every love movie
[16:32] and love story that we see is follow
[16:34] your heart.
[16:38] Does the scripture tell us to follow our
[16:39] heart? Jesus on the sermon on the mount,
[16:42] he it starts out, blessed are those who
[16:44] follow their heart. Oh, that's Disney,
[16:47] not the
[16:50] scripture. This is this is critical
[16:52] because our heart is deceitful and
[16:54] desperately wicked. Who can know it? You
[16:56] say, "But I'm born again." Okay, the
[16:59] heart is deceitful and desperately
[17:00] wicked. Who who can know it? You have to
[17:03] understand that all of that has to be
[17:05] surrendered to the Lord. And the biggest
[17:07] place that the heart is deceived is
[17:10] through, we call it love in America, but
[17:13] it's emotion. Usually it's lust or
[17:16] infatuation. Let's let's say let's say
[17:19] it the real nice way.
[17:21] Infatuation. We we get confused. We
[17:24] become infatuated and this consumes us.
[17:28] And instead of seeking the mind of the
[17:30] Lord, I just feel I just feel this. I
[17:33] feel so strongly. I'm just in love with
[17:36] them. It was love at first sight. We
[17:37] fell in
[17:38] love it. Love is a lot more than a virus
[17:43] that we catch. Love is a decision that
[17:46] you make. Love is a choice. Love is
[17:50] action. Love is lived out. And
[17:53] ultimately, the only thing that love is
[17:55] when it comes to in a marriage is it's a
[17:59] covenant between a man and a woman and
[18:02] God. Amen. You're entering into a
[18:04] covenant for life.
[18:07] There's no such thing as divorce.
[18:08] There's no such thing as quitting.
[18:10] There's no such a thing as giving up.
[18:12] It's a covenant. It's a commitment for
[18:14] life. That is where love is found. Not
[18:19] in feelings and emotions. The covenant
[18:22] is where it starts. Feelings and
[18:24] emotions will come and go.
[18:29] Proverbs
[18:32] 7:21-27. With her much fair speech she
[18:35] caused him to yield. With the flattering
[18:37] of her lips she forced him. He goeth
[18:41] after her straight way as an ox goeth to
[18:43] the slaughter or as a fool to the
[18:44] correction of the stocks. Till a dart
[18:48] strike through his liver, as a bird
[18:50] hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not
[18:52] that it is for his life. Hearken unto me
[18:55] now, therefore, oh ye children, and
[18:56] attend unto the words of my mouth. Let
[18:59] not thine heart decline to her ways. Go
[19:01] not astray in her paths, for she hath
[19:04] cast down many wounded. Yay, many strong
[19:07] men have been slain by her. Her house is
[19:09] the way to hell, going down to the
[19:11] chambers of
[19:14] death. We're not we're not to follow
[19:17] after the lust of the eye. Amen. Notice
[19:21] that the heart, even the heart declines
[19:24] to her ways. So the heart can deceive us
[19:26] completely. Even people who are
[19:31] Christians can be deceived.
[19:34] Okay? It won't be permanent. But in
[19:36] marriage
[19:37] relationships, it becomes a permanent.
[19:39] It becomes a permanent mistake that you
[19:42] have to live with
[19:44] forever. And you're committed to. If
[19:46] you're a Christian, you won't give up.
[19:47] You won't quit. You'll do your best to
[19:49] make it work, but you probably will make
[19:52] yourself entirely miserable.
[19:57] Again, the purpose of of this is not to
[20:00] make you
[20:01] fearful of relationships, fearful of
[20:04] courtship, fearful of mar marriage, but
[20:07] I think there is a there is a proper
[20:09] sense to understand that this is a very
[20:12] reverent thing to take part in. It can
[20:15] be enjoyable. It can be delightful. If
[20:19] you do it God's way, it will be a great
[20:20] blessing to you. But if you have no
[20:23] reverence for it, you're going to suffer
[20:26] the consequences of your lack of
[20:27] reverence. And that can be a huge
[20:30] problem that we face amongst young
[20:32] people today is there's a lack of
[20:35] reverence towards relationships, towards
[20:39] the opposite sex. And when you don't
[20:41] have that proper reverence for that, you
[20:45] get yourself caught up in the midst of a
[20:47] lot of circumstances that are very
[20:50] problematic and lead you down the path
[20:53] of
[20:54] evil. A young lady that's a this
[20:58] Proverbs 7, a young lady that's
[21:00] aggressively following after a man
[21:03] trying to get him to yield to her. Now,
[21:06] you might be even doing that within
[21:08] within a, you know, a nice spectrum. Not
[21:12] so bad. But yet, being aggressive about
[21:15] it, you're not doing what the will of
[21:17] the Lord is for your life. It's not a
[21:20] woman's, it's not a young lady's place
[21:22] to be aggressive and pursue after young
[21:25] men. That's not
[21:27] scriptural. A woman doesn't run after
[21:30] men. That's that for any young man you
[21:33] see a a young lady running
[21:36] after running after you or other people,
[21:39] it's a red flag. Uh-oh, there's a
[21:44] problem, right? And so this this is this
[21:47] is critical when you're looking at
[21:54] character. What should a young man look
[21:56] for?
[21:58] Number one, he reflects Christ in his in
[22:00] his she reflects Christ in her
[22:03] character. She dresses
[22:06] modestly. She respects and submits to
[22:09] her
[22:09] father. If she doesn't respect and
[22:12] submit to her father, it's a really good
[22:14] sign. It's a really good indication
[22:16] she's not going to respect and submit to
[22:18] you either.
[22:21] If she doesn't have a good relationship
[22:23] with her father, it's probably a good
[22:26] sign she won't have a relation good
[22:28] relationship with you. Now, there can be
[22:30] other circumstances and things. He might
[22:32] be a terrible dad. But if if all
[22:35] appearances are that he's a good dad and
[22:38] she's rebellious against him, this is a
[22:40] good sign to say, "Hey, you we need to
[22:43] we need to back off here. This isn't a
[22:45] good this this this isn't a good
[22:47] direction. and you need to figure things
[22:48] out with your dad before we move
[22:50] forward. Number four, she desires to be
[22:53] a mother at home. Number five, scripture
[22:57] holds up a meek and quiet spirit as a
[23:00] great treasure in a young lady in the
[23:02] sight of God. What should a young lady
[23:05] look for for? Number one, that the young
[23:08] man reflects Christ in his character.
[23:10] Number two, he's a real man, not a
[23:12] feminized boy. Number three, he respects
[23:15] and loves his mother. is that's going to
[23:18] be a reflection of his relationship with
[23:20] you in the future. Amen. Number four,
[23:24] he's capable of providing for you. You
[23:27] know, the reality is if if a young man
[23:30] can't provide for a young woman and she
[23:33] doesn't know who she is, there should be
[23:34] no courtship taking place.
[23:38] Because courtship is discerning the will
[23:40] of God for marriage. We'll talk about
[23:41] that next
[23:43] time. Courtship is discerning the will
[23:45] of God for marriage. And so if you're
[23:47] it's not just like how the world does
[23:49] it. I think then probably the next time
[23:51] we'll talk about the process that's
[23:54] developed in the 20th century of of
[23:58] dating and so forth. The the very word
[24:01] date is a word borrowed from the late
[24:04] 19th century that says that speaks of
[24:07] putting putting your name in a book to
[24:10] meet with a prostitute. That's where the
[24:12] word dating etmology of the word dating
[24:14] comes from.
[24:20] So if a young man's not capable of
[24:23] providing for a young lady, there's no
[24:26] there's no need for courtship to take
[24:28] place because there's he's not ready
[24:34] obviously. Number five, there's not a
[24:36] boy that jumps from girl to girl to
[24:38] girl. He's got this girl, then that
[24:39] girl, then this girl. That's a big sign.
[24:41] It'll probably continue when he relaxes
[24:43] a little bit after after marriage takes
[24:46] place. Someone that's consistent as we
[24:48] spoke about before. Like like like
[24:50] Daniel, not like Nebuchadnezzar, not
[24:53] like Belshazzar, jumping from thing to
[24:56] thing and this idea to that idea here to
[24:58] there, but someone no matter where he's
[25:01] at, he's consistent in his life and in
[25:05] his walk with the Lord.
[25:12] That's a good place to close from where
[25:14] my notes are at. So, let's let's stand
[25:16] and
[25:21] pray. Heavenly Father, we just come
[25:23] before you now, Lord, and we ask that
[25:25] your presence would be with us. Father,
[25:27] we thank you for your word. We pray that
[25:29] you'd write it on our hearts and in our
[25:31] minds, Lord, that we would be molded and
[25:33] shaped into the image of Jesus Christ.
[25:35] Lord, bless the worship. Bless the
[25:37] preaching of the word today. Be
[25:38] glorified in our midst. We commit
[25:40] ourselves to you in Jesus name.
