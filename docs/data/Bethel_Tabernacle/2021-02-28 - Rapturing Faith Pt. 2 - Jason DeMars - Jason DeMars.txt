TRANSCRIPT
========================================
gracious heavenly father we just come to you lord and we're so thankful for your word we ask that you bless this study this morning that you would speak to us speak through us lord and that your name would be lifted up and glorified lord lord just ask your blessing upon the the whole day the service the worship the preaching of the word ask that you would come and deal with hearts lord and heal the sick and afflicted and touch touch bodies and minds lord we ask you in jesus name amen while you're standing let's look at ii timothy chapter 4 and verse 7. we're going to talk about christian character part 13 and i'm entitling this character characteristic of a believer grit so i know we don't find that word in the bible but i think we find that characteristic in the bible and spoken of in a different way but ii timothy 4 7 i have fought a good fight i have finished my course i have kept the faith may the lord add the blessing to the reading of the word you can be seated grit is a positive trait based on an individual's perseverance of effort combined with passion for a particular long-term goal or purpose another way to describe grit would be determination to fulfill your god-given purpose regardless of the obstacles you face there's no discouragement fainting or giving up for a christmas for a christian amen sure there's things that happen that are discouraging there's sure there's things that happen that cause us to faint but none of that causes us a real believer to give up we go through all kinds of ups and downs and hills and valleys and emotions that are high emotions that are low that comes along with being human but for a christian none of that would impact what what what our choices are in our walk with god matthew 10 verse 22 and you shall be hated of all men for my name's sake but he that endureth to the end shall be saved this was jesus sending his disciples on a missionary trip so just imagine you're being instructed you're going on a missionary trip i want you to know you're going to be hated by everyone you can be hated by everyone but the one that endures to the end will be saved endurance that's important that's that's a character trait of a real believer put in to you by the spirit of god what people on the outside do to you say to you how you're treated could come from people that you highly regard and respect none of that matters to you the one thing that matters is your heart with god outside of that how people respond how people will react that's in their that's in their court as we talked about before part of this grit and endurance is the other characteristics love patience forgiveness perseverance through all of these things let's look at some examples of grit acts 5 17-29 it's a lot of verses to read but i think i want to get the picture for for all of us then the high priest rose up and all they that were with him which is the sect of the sadducees and were filled with indignation man the apostles said something that made them so angry and laid their hands on the apostles and put them in common prison but the angel of the lord by night opened the prison doors and brought them forth and said run into the wilderness and hide go stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life and they're like but they're the one ones that put me in jail no go and stand there in the temple and when they heard that when they heard that no they didn't run away no they didn't hide when they heard that they entered into the temple early in the morning and taught but the high priest came and they that were with them and called the council together and all the senate of the children the sanhedrin of the children of israel and sent to the prison to have them brought out but when the officers came and found them not in the prison they returned and told saying the prison truly found we shut with all safety and the keepers standing without before the doors but when we had opened we found no man within now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these things they doubted of them where unto this would grow amen then came one and told them saying behold the men whom you put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people that's grit then when went the captain with the officers and brought them without violence for they feared the people lest they should have been stoned somebody's fearing the people somebody's not fearing the people and one of them is serving god and one of them is not serving god and when they had brought them they set them before the council and the high priest asked them saying didn't did we not straightly we were pretty clear command you that you should not teach in this name and behold you have filled jerusalem with your doctrine and to intend to bring this man's blood upon us then peter and the other apostles answered and said we ought to obey god rather than men now that is grit that is determination to do exactly what god has purposed and called you to do regardless of the circumstances and i believe there's something in a christian that really grasped this because jesus was the same john 2 23-25 now when he was in jerusalem at the passover in the feast day many believed in his name when they saw the miracles which he did now look at this but jesus did not commit himself unto them because he knew all men and needed not that any should testify of man for he knew what was in man what does that mean because the reality is in the big picture jesus was calling men who were supposed to be fishers of men right they were supposed to tell other people about him so it's not that he wasn't going to have people testify about him it's something deeper than that and i think it's something that we need to have and that's an understanding that my sufficiency comes from my relationship with god not with what other people say about me or think about me or what i think other people think about me my sufficiency comes from god alone and you know jesus loved these people it's not that he didn't he's not saying well he just hated him and disregarded him he had compassion upon them he loved them he lived for these people but he knew i cannot say oh they're believing on me i'm so excited this is amazing everybody testify i'm gonna be no he wasn't going about it that way i don't need anyone to testify of me i simply my job is to obey my father what does he say all through the book of john my meat my food is to do my father's will and accomplish his purpose my food isn't the adulation of the people my food isn't getting pats on the back good job nice nice sermon nice healing that's not that wasn't his food his food was to do his father's will and accomplish his purpose and that is that is for us that is our job our job is not to get pats on the back and get good comments nice sermon our job is to accomplish our father's will regardless of how people respond regardless of what their attitude is about what we've said or done our job is to please him so jesus did not commit himself unto them because he knew it was in man someone that can be your best friend one minute can turn around and be what stab you in the back does it hurt absolutely should it change what we're doing as long as we're doing the father's will it should not change what we're doing we should continue to walk in obedience regardless from the sermon melchizedek the great prince and king in 1955 brother branham says whether it's popularity whether it's our church whether it's our friends our associate associates whatever it may be whether whether it's our doctor whether it's our priest whether it's our preacher all other grounds is sinking sands christ alone and every man that's ever amounted to anything in this great battlefield of strife has been men and women i like that he put not just men men and women who stood alone on them convictions when everything else failed and fell around them they stood still abraham lincoln of old was convinced that he was right he stood alone on his conviction but he proved it and sealed his testimony with his own blood jesus christ stood alone in his day as an example that every man upon his convictions of god's eternal truth that will take him his stand positionally and stand will stand alone but not alone with god the invisible companion who follows us through life's journey down through the shadows of the valleys of the shadows of death and into eternity he'll still go with us and be god i love that every man that's ever amounted to anything in this great battlefield of strife has been men and women who stood alone on them convictions and that's what our heart needs to be we need to know who we are know what god has called us to know his word and take our stand and if the whole world turns against us we have to know i prayed god spoke i acted the rest is in his hands i'm not going to stop i'm going to keep going forward james 1 verse 12 blessed is the man that endures temptation for when he has tried he shall receive the crown of life which the lord has promised to them that love him we go through a lot of things in this life we go through a lot of trials we go through a lot of things that are painful that hurt that challenge our faith in god amen and that's normal it's not something we should be surprised about isn't that what the apostle says we shouldn't be surprised by the fiery trial which tries us all these things are to be absolutely expected in our christian walk amen and what is it blessed is the man that endures temptation or trials why because we'll receive the crown of life brother branham in jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever in 1955 again says did you ever come to think of it that most men who ever do anything great for the kingdom of god stand alone did you ever think of it you have to stand by yourself jesus stood alone and all down through the ages other men who stood alone finney sankey calvin knox even to abraham lincoln that's right stood alone men who do great things men of vision men of spiritual understanding stand alone and i think that's because that jesus had to stand alone himself now all of these that are spoken of it doesn't mean that they didn't have friends around them but it was a disposition of their heart towards what the whole the trend of the world was saying or the religious trend of the day was saying they were willing to say this is right and if all hell comes against me the whole world comes against me i'm standing on my convictions no matter what and then people supported them and and helped them and stood by them but they weren't doing it because people were standing by them they were doing it because it was right and i think that's the point that brother branham's trying to make is you stand alone and truly the fact is we all stand alone with god whether we think that way or not what other people around us believe or think or do we're not going to answer for that we answer for ourselves in the sight of god amen first corinthians 16 verse 13. watchy stand fast in the faith quit you like men be strong now this verse that says quit you like men it is not just written to men it's also written to sisters because it's written to the saints in corinth which consists of men and women so he's what does that mean quit you like men we obviously don't speak like that in today's vernacular what does it literally mean it means to act manly so sisters act manly brothers you two act manly that doesn't mean in the sense of 21st century modern nonsense what does it mean it means to take a stand to be strong to take the hits and the punches that the world gives and punch back with the word take your stand punch back with god's character god's love god's truth and don't give up don't be weak be strong sisters be manly in christ is the mystery of god revealed brother branham says this what happened in the pre-figure now he opened adam's side and took part of his flesh which was adam to make eve the bride has to be the word for he is the word she cannot stand on creed she cannot stand on denomination she cannot stand on good behavior she has to stand alone on the word because she is part of it she was taken from christ that's each of us each of us men you're referred to as a woman a bride right and what do we do we have to stand alone on the word so bride be manly amen take that stand stand alone if you have to in perfect faith brother branham says but jesus lived in a world that no one knowed about he was an odd person he lived in a world of perfect faith and the perfect god in which he was if we lived in a perfect faith of a christian to what we are we'd be a mystic to the world the people wouldn't understand you you'd walk in the spirit what the spirit said you would do what it forbid you would not do then the people people can begin to say you'd be a mystic person to them that's the way it is to all believers they're a mystic the people don't understand because they live in a world to themselves jesus lived in a world that nobody else could touch the disciples couldn't understand him when he spoke to them they say this and then they say why are you talking riddle riddles we don't understand this how can this be see they wasn't in the world that he lived in see they couldn't understand him nobody could understand him and so when a man lives by faith and walks by faith i mean substance faith he is isolated from the entire world and becomes a new creature in christ there now you're getting into bride material see you're getting into rapturing condition now that means for each one of us not just the pastor deacon's trustees that means for the laity every individual walks in a world alone with god alone you're baptized into this kingdom and there's nobody in there but you and god he gives the orders and you pack them out whatever he says there's not a shadow of doubt nowhere you walk right in if the lord says this there's nobody in the world can talk you out of it you go right on just the same now you're coming into perfect faith perfect perfection that cannot fail that faith never fails yes he was a mystic to them with his perfect faith and so is it now with those who have perfect faith are a mystic to others amen now that doesn't mean we're supposed to go out and act like we're insane it doesn't mean we're supposed to act crazy it what does it mean it means that you and it does also doesn't mean that we're not a part of a body of christ right it's not he's not taking away from any of those things at all what is he saying it's that's what our disposition is i'm not saying well what is brother charles doing oh if brother charles do that then i'll do it well brother brother jason does it pastor does it and says to do it no i'm not packing orders from a man that's not what he's saying about it every believer every believer pac walks into the presence of god and packs their orders out right each one of us have to do that and if we do that what happens we start to walk in harmony but when we are getting our own orders and looking around what am i supposed to be doing so-and-so is doing this this one's doing that that's when confusion and disunity comes disunity doesn't come from us being a mystic walking in a world alone with god that's where true unity comes from god loves unity but not babylon unity not unity on a human level worked out by humans for humans but unity with every one of our hearts unified with him and that we will obey him regardless of what anyone around us is doing now we're talking about real unity in the body of christ second corinthians 11. i'm going to read about the apostle paul we read that scripture to start with i have fought a good fight finished my course kept the faith paul in second corinthians speaks about what he went through and i doubt any of us have or ever will go through what he went through but i want you to see the picture of his endurance of his grit second corinthians 11 23 are they servants of christ and i'm reading from the esb because some of the the the descriptions uh are difficult to understand in the kjv are they servants of christ i'm a better one i'm talking like a madman with far greater labors far more imprisonments with countless beatings and often near death five times i received at the hands of the jews the forty lashes less one three times i was beaten with rods once i was stoned three times i was shipwrecked a night and a day i was adrift at sea on frequent journeys in dangers from rivers danger from robbers danger from my own people danger from gentiles dangers danger in the city danger in the wilderness danger at sea danger from false brothers in toil and hardships through many a sleepless night in hunger and thirst often without food in cold and exposure and apart from other things there was there's the daily pressure on me of the my anxiety for all the churches who is weak and i'm not weak who is made to fall and i am not indignant if i must boast i will boast of the things that show my weakness the god and father of the lord jesus who is blessed forever knows i'm not lying at damascus the governor under king aritis was guarding the city of damascus in order to seize me but i was let down in a basket through a window in the wall and escaped his hands i must go on boasting though there is nothing to be gained by it i will go on to visions and revelations of the lord i know a man in christ who 14 years ago was caught up to the third heaven whether in the body or out of the body i do not know god knows and i know that this man was caught up into paradise whether in the body or out of the body i do not know god knows and he heard things that cannot be told which man may not utter on behalf of this man i will boast but on my own behalf i will not boast except of my weaknesses though if i should wish to boast i would not be a fool for i would be speaking the truth but i refrain from it so that no one may think more of me than he sees in me and hears from me so to keep me from becoming conceited because of the surpassing greatness of the revelations a thorn was given me in the flesh a messenger of satan to harass me to keep me from becoming conceited three times i pleaded with the lord about this that it should leave me but he said to me my grace is sufficient for you for my power is made perfect in weakness therefore i will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses so that the power of christ may rest upon me for the sake of christ then i am content with weaknesses insults hardships persecutions and calamities for when i am weak then i am strong so he writes to timothy in second timothy two verse three thou therefore endure hardship hardness undergo hardship or endure inflictions as a good soldier of jesus christ those were words written by someone who do you imagine all those calamities that he went through that happened to him and he didn't say well i must be on the wrong path i mean god's not blessing me my life so i really must be out of the will of god he said all of this can be expected and more and i'm not going to quit i'm going to keep going no matter what i'm going to keep following the voice of god in my life i'm going to keep speaking the truth i'm going to keep doing what i'm supposed to do what did he do when he went on his way to jerusalem every city he went to they prophesied they're going to put you in chains and deliver you over to rome and he says why are you trying to break my heart because they're crying they're crying and they're broke up we won't we won't see you ever again and so forth why are you trying to break my heart i'm ready to die for the name of the lord jesus i don't count my life as anything that's that is the walk of a christian that is not an exceptional christian i don't want you to think like that paul was an exceptional christian we can never have that heart and attitude no you are not going to have the same ministry as paul or brother branham or martin luther or whatever absolutely not those are different ministries in the body of christ that's not the point the point is his heart as a believer should be the heart of every believer we need to wrestle with these things am i willing to do everything it takes and lose everything and my life also in this walk with christ that should already be dealt with that that should be answered a long time ago for me to live as christ and to die is gain amen does that make you go i hope not if it does wrestle with it wrestle with it in prayer in your heart because it is it is a truth we have to be determined to do the will of god regardless of the opposition that we face when we're not supposed to be chocolate soldiers that melt under the pressure we're supposed to be strong full of grit determined to do what god would have us to do whether it means the destruction of our body or our lives our finances whatever it might be that god calls us to do we need to be willing to do that even if the whole world says you're crazy amen amen let's stand and pray heavenly father as i think of those words and read of the life and the experiences of paul the apostle his words that in one of his last letters that he ever wrote to his dear son in the faith timothy told him to endure hardship as a good soldier of jesus christ and told timothy that he had fought a good fight he'd finished his course he had kept the faith lord i think that's what every one of us need to be in that condition this world is full of demonic forces trying to block us and stop us and derail us from being obedient to you lord so we ask father that you would help and strengthen and empower us to have this genuine grit of a christian that we see our our goal and our purpose of our life and that we will let nothing derail us from that commit each one to you lord for your glory we ask it in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you [Music] you
