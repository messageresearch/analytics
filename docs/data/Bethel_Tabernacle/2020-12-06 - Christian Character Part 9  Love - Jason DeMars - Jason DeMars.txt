========================================

you [Music] good morning everyone god bless you let's stand as we pray gracious heavenly father we just come to you in the name of jesus christ and we want to dedicate this time of sunday school and bible study to you we ask that your spirit would come and take control lord we just want to surrender ourselves lord both speaker and here to you and ask that you would have your perfect way lord as we proceed with the sunday school and service today lord would you be glorified would you move and work in people's hearts in a mighty way father we ask these things in the name of jesus christ amen all right our opening scripture is first thessalonians chapter four we're continuing on our topic of christian character part nine and where lord willing will be finishing up our sub-topic of love so first thessalonians 4 9 and 10 but as touching brotherly love that's the word philadelphia from the word root word filio you need not that i write unto you for you ye yourselves are taught of god to love agape one another and indeed you do it toward all the brethren which are in all macedonia but we beseech you brethren that you increase more and more may the lord add the blessing to the reading of his word you can be seated so we've said it before but there's an overlapping between brotherly love filio love and agape love we he says you don't have need of anyone to teach you regarding brotherly love filio love because god himself teaches you to agape one another so when you have agape love that covers filio love as well it's not a separate thing it's like if you have agape love outflowing from that is brotherly love family love love to your spouse etc love to your enemy all those all those different things so that's cr that's critical that we have god's agape love and how do we get god's love it's shed abroad in our hearts by the holy ghost in other words we get filled up and it spills out on other people romans 12 9 and 10 say this let love agape be without dissimulation abhor that which is is evil cleave to that which is good be kindly affection fellow store ghost this means this is a combination of the word brotherly love or friendship type of love and store goes family love so be be filo store ghosts one to another with philadelphia in honor preferring one another so just in those two verses we have agape filio storgos philadelphia all in those verses it's it's talking about god's love being in us flowing through us we saw before agape love spoken of through the strong's concordance is wider embracing especially the judgment and the deliberate ascent of the will as a matter of principle duty and propriety filio love speaks of having affection for denoting personal attachment as a matter of sentiment or feeling whereas agape is embracing the judgment and the deliberate scent of the will as a matter of principle duty and propriety in other words god has called me to love and i love regardless of feeling regardless of connection regardless of anything whereas filio love is there's a connection and there's an affection and there's a personal attachment that you have there's a sentiment there's a feeling that you have agape is regardless of feeling filio encompasses that and so as christians we certainly should have agape for one another but it really not to go deeper we should have a feeling a sentiment a care for one another and that's why he uses christian love as philadelphia brotherly love adelph a delphi is the word that's used over and over again in the new testament for the relationship that we have together as christians it's like it's translated as brotherly but it's not male or it's not a male or female word it's a non-male or female word it's speaking of that that love that siblings like a siblings love so philadelphia is the love of siblings to one another and that's what that's what we're to be and and naturally according to god's nature you have that feeling that sentiment towards one another it isn't always that way in this fallen world but in god's plan and god's purpose there is not only agape love for your brothers and sisters but there's that feeling that sentiment that affection that you have for one another john 15 13-15 again we're reviewing but i like to take two steps forward one step back in teaching just so we can really get it down greater love hath no man than this that a man lay down his life for his friends so i feel like jesus is really coming here and saying i'm going to define what christian friendship is we get this and we take this and it's beautiful and it's speaking about jesus but he's really not just talking about himself he's talking about the kind of love that we need to have for one another greater love has no man than this that a man laid down his life for his friends that's a that's a selfless love it's not a self it's not an inward focused love it's a love that's focus outward it's a love that's focused and sees what's going on outside and then goes and lays itself down to bear the burden of your brother or sister in christ you he says you're my friends if you do whatever whatsoever i command you so here this is this is something that doesn't go to one another i can't say brother michael you're my friend if you do whatever i tell you to do this is different that that goes between us and jesus christ only you're my friends if you do whatever you whatever i command you verse 15 henceforth i call you not servants for the servant knows not what his lord doeth but i've called you friends for all things that i have heard of my father i have made known unto you what is he saying i have opened my self i've opened up my heart and i've shared myself with you that's why that's why i call you my friends so a beautiful definition of friendship friendship is opening one another's heart up to each other connecting communicating fellow fellowshipping together in in a way that you know we bear one another's burdens not in a way that i got news about this one i'm going to share it to this one no it's we're able to open up ourselves to each other because there's trust there's respect and there's an ultimate desire we want to see the best for one another hebrews 3 13 says but exhort one another daily while it is called today lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin if we're so disconnected and don't communicate with one another how on earth can we exhort one another daily we can't you can't you have to have a connection with each other you have to have a communication with each other there has to be an openness how else would you exhort someone because you know what's going on in their life you know the difficulties they're facing why because you ask them you talk to them you communicate with them you speak with them and you can do that for each other and then you encourage you you show the scripture you show the message you apply it to one another's life not not with a club with love with love with care and sometimes it needs to be hard and sometimes it needs to be difficult things need to be said but that's what french real friendship is as we'll see that more as we look further in the scriptures galatians 6 2 bear ye one another's burdens and soul fulfill the law of christ if you want to fulfill the law of christ well what is the law of christ love your neighbor as yourself so how do you fulfill that love your neighbor as yourself paul defines it bear one another's burdens you know if you look if you look further he says let each man bear his own burden why does he say but why does he say it both ways because our inward attitude needs to be such i'm going to bear my own burden and then i'm going to bear the burden of others i'm not going to sit around and say these decrepit people they're not bearing my burden why aren't they burying my burden but that's the attitude that christians will get sometimes they're so focused on themselves they're waiting for someone else to bear their burden the bible says to you bear your own burden and then bear the other person's burden it doesn't say wait for other people to bear your burden i didn't see that anywhere in what paul was writing in galatians 6. you can go back and read it for yourself maybe i missed it but his attitude was bury your own burden and bear the other person's burden it wasn't it wasn't wait for other people to bear your own burden no we can't do that we can't have that attitude the body of christ can't operate properly in that fashion it always has to be okay i'm gonna take i'm gonna take care of my own with all that i can and then i'm gonna bear someone else's burden and if you get in a place where you can't bear your own burden and you're struggling it shouldn't be i give up on these people because they're not burying my burden too often that's that's the attitude that we find i'm gonna go find another church and guess what eventually you run into the same exact problem why because the problem's inside of you wow why is the problem inside of you because you have it backwards get it get it in the direction that paul had it bear your burden bear other's burden and don't wait for someone to bear your burden it's not how it's it's not how your attitude is supposed to work it's how it's supposed to work absolutely people should be burying your burden but if you're walking around waiting for other people to bury your burden you'll be sad alone depressed frustrated upset and you'll be in a continual cycle of the very same thing why because it's not god's way it's not god's heart towards these things proverbs 27 is a beautiful chapter in your in your own time go and read it i think the key word of proverbs 27 is friend faithful this is verse proverbs 27 verse 6 faithful of are the wounds of a friend but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful psalm 141 5 really helps explain that further let the righteous smite me it shall be a kindness and let him reprove me it shall be an excellent oil which shall not break my head for yet my prayer also shall be in their calamities psalm 141 verse 5 i believe it is um yeah so faithful are the wounds of the friend it means that your friend is bringing correction to you your friend loves you enough to speak what is true now don't get it backwards a friend earns the trust of another person i said it before you don't just start going into people's lives and beating them over the head and say why aren't why don't they like me there's other principles that we have to follow in the in this very scripture you earn your trust you earn that trust you earn that level of uh transparency between one another you have to you have to earn it people don't just open up instantaneously and become your friend you earn that and then when you earn it now you can be straight with each other you can shoot straight and say brother i i love you i was wondering about what happened here not assuming the worst we talked about that before in first corinthians 13. you're not assuming the other words you're clarifying and you're pointing back to scripture and it needs to be given so that the person understands and knows that the motive is love and not the motive if you put your motive as well i want to i want everything to be righteous you're approaching it like a pharisee not like jesus approached it with love and tenderness that that literally will melt your heart like our brother was testifying jesus came to him he corrected he corrected our brother he his mother continually pointed him to the scripture in correction but what what was it what was behind all of that love and he felt that and it melted him and i think the same thing needs to be in our hearts when we approach other people if our words and our approach is not melting their hearts the way jesus would melt what i mean melt their hearts i'm not talking about some romantic thing i'm talking about something that puts them in the presence of god and touches them that they receive it and they receive it as as the love of god the kisses of an enemy are deceitful in other words flattery just can someone's just flattering you constantly just be careful be careful they want something they want something from you so be careful proverb then verse 9 of the same chapter ointment and perfume rejoice the heart so doeth the sweetness of a man's friend by hearty counsel again beautiful picture of friendship true scriptural not the world's version the world has a version of friendship and that's just mutual enjoyment over mutual things that you have in common that's not what christian friendship is christian friendship transcends that you might have mutual things in common you might like to go fishing you might like to go hunting you might like to sew you might like whatever you might be homeschool moms whatever it might be that's good that's fine but christian friendship transcends that you know we've all gone through seasons of life where we have a certain friend and they're it's really really helpful and then it's gone but christian friendship is different it isn't well it's helpful and then they're gone christian friendship is transcending our likes and entrance and goes deeper it's a family it's a family a relationship not just the family of god and we're all in relationship to god but we're also in relationship to one another and here the sweetness of a man's friend is by hardy council i think i mentioned this before but we think of friends as people we just have fun with but a friend is a chief influencer they are the people that you surround yourself that you're with that you're influenced by that is advising you and whatever they do they're going to rub off on you you say well i'm stronger than that no you're not because that is not how it's designed that is not how god designed friendships we are to influence one another in a good way not a bad way if you're if you look at your friends and you see the projection of their life and you say oh boy i don't want to be like them i don't want to be like how their parents are i don't want to be like how this is then question your choice of friends turn turn around the influence who is influencing who absolutely but you have friends and can you have friends that are outside of christ you can you can but you have to turn the influence on its head if you don't you will be the one that's being influenced away from christ i learned that as a great lesson when i first got saved i tried to maintain all my friends and the next thing you know i'm sitting around and they're all drinking and smoking marijuana and i'm going oh lord help me how am i going to not do this and the next thing you know there's a there's a drink in my hand and you're you're going what is i don't want this and they're swearing and cussing and all of a sudden you're trying as hard as you can and all of a sudden you're swearing and cussing what's the what's the what's the issue you never flipped the relationship the relationship stayed the same and it's a danger especially for you for everyone for everyone but especially for young people especially for young people when i was 20 21 years old i went to a church service with my sister and my brother-in-law and it was a very thing that i was struggling with and the minister gets up and begins talking about friendships and he says don't be unequally yoked together with unbelievers he's saying it's not doesn't mean you can't have friends or unbelievers you want to win them to christ but the problem is is that the the level of the relationship you had is going this direction now you have flipped around and you're going this direction because you're in christ but the influence is staying on this level and it's bringing you it's not letting you go up higher it's dragging you down and he said so he said what you want to do is sit down with your friends tell them what has happened in your life tell them exactly without mincing words what christ has done for you testify to them what he's done for you and then tell them the direction in my life is i want to live for christ i want to live a more scriptural holy life and they might not understand that but they understand it on some level and and tell and tell them i want to be your friend moving forward i do but we can't remain on the same level that we were always on we we i i want i want you to encourage me in my life as a christian whether you become a christian or not as a friend will you please help me and if there's a party or if there's a place where it's compromising position don't let me go don't let me go don't let me get involved in that if you want to continue to be friends on that uh with with this in mind let's continue if not then i guess we just give each other a hug and and separate ways and and not hang out anymore and i did that it was incredible all my friends of course said oh that's great yeah of course i'll help you and then 99 out of 100 vanished and one stayed with me and he did encourage me and he did say we shouldn't go there because of this or we shouldn't do that because of this well then i found out who really was my friend who really cared about me and i could be a positive influence on him and so i think young people that's so critical to keep in mind as the scripture says oh missing the scripture here yeah the sweetness of a man's friend is by hearty counsel make sure that you have the sweetness of a friend not the corruption of a of a fake false friend that's trying to drag you down verse 10 thy known friend and thy father's friend forsake not neither go into thy brother's house in the day of thy calamity for better is a neighbor that is nearer than a brother that is far off the importance of not forsaking your friends being loyal being faithful is critical whether it's your friend or your father's friend sometimes that's the greatest thing that you can have in your life is your dad's friends and your own friends that stay stay by you that are faithful to you that help you they'll stick with you no matter what and it's he says it's better to have a friend a neighbor that's a friend he'll take care of you than a brother who's far off the brother far off won't treat you as well as the neighbor who is close to you who's a friend to you true friend to you proverbs 27 verse 14 he that blesses his friend with a loud voice rising early in the morning it shall be counted a curse to him what does it mean it's loud boisterous uh flatteries and oh bless you they're the greatest friend and you're just so obnoxious about it over the top it it shows that there's something lacking there there's something out of cater there's some that person is not a real friend they're not they're not real and genuine they're just wanting to get something out of you verse 17 iron sharpens iron so a man sharpens the countenance of his friend i just want to probably close with that verse sharpening a sword in the ancient world was very difficult it wasn't a simple and quick process it took a long time it wasn't done in seconds they didn't have an electric wheel and they just and it's done no it was hard can i say hard difficult work to sharpen a sword by hand in those days it took persistent careful striking to get it sharpened it didn't just take seconds it took time and i believe sometimes we miss that in this proverb it's speaking of the importance of persistence in friendship it's not just a one-time thing as an acquaintance and we pass and say hey how are you doing and it's on it's a long term process of friendship iron sharpens iron takes time takes persistence it takes effort to sharpen and so does the same thing in a friendship it takes time it takes persistence it takes effort it's not a one-time deal it's a continual long-term effort that needs to take place it real friendship is long-term real friendship is with you through thick and thin good and bad they're there with you they care about you regardless of what you're going through regardless if you're poor or rich whether it's going well whether it's going bad they're there why because they care about your soul and it needs to go both ways iron sharpening iron it goes both ways we sharpen our hearts and minds through godly discus discussion and as that happens our true nature often comes out by these interactions with our friends and then our true and genuine friends they start to give you feedback to further sharpen your understanding and your character a genuine friend is faithful over time to offer his criticism his instruction his positive feedback but he doesn't give up he doesn't view it as this is just a one-time thing and i'm gone he views this this is a continual conversation that we're gonna have so that we can grow together in in christ it's not a one-off it's not gonna it's not gonna work it's not to that's not how our nature has changed that's not how sanctification works that's not how iron sharpening iron works it is continual effort continual back and forth fellowship friendship that doesn't grow tired or weary verse 21 as the finding pot for silver and the furnace for gold so is a man to his praise as the old saying goes when the character of a man is not clear to you look at his friends there's a there's a reflection there that happens a man look you look down uh you look in though as you look in the mirror it reflects back to you same thing with the band's friends you know what kind of friends do you have what kind of life do you want to live then choose your friends accordingly amen let's pray let's stand and pray gracious heavenly father we thank you so much for your light and your love lord just continue to move and work in our lives lord we want to live a godly life with the character of jesus christ within us lord and we just ask that you'd continue to teach us and and correct us and mold us and shape us according to that image lord we give our give ourselves to you we ask it in the name of jesus christ for your glory amen amen god bless you
