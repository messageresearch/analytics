[25:00] As I look back, Back down the pathway up
[25:02] the mountain. I have trod weary worn and
[25:06] feet a little sore.
[25:09] Thought by now I'd be much further up
[25:12] the road than where I am. I've cast
[25:15] aside some weight, but must do so much
[25:18] more.
[25:19] There's no time to waste my fleeting
[25:22] precious time.
[25:25] Besetting wait with haste I will swiftly
[25:28] cast aside.
[25:31] No time to stay. I'll keep pressing on.
[25:35] I can hardly wait. I know I'm almost
[25:38] home.
[25:40] [Music]
[25:47] Oft gaze across the valley of decision
[25:51] where I was and thank the Lord he led me
[25:55] from that place.
[25:58] The heights I've gained are greater than
[26:00] were all my yesterdays. But I must press
[26:03] on to see my savior's face.
[26:07] There's no time to waste my fleeting
[26:09] precious time.
[26:12] be setting weight with haste. I will
[26:15] swiftly cast aside.
[26:17] [Music]
[26:18] No time to stay. Oh, I'll keep pressing
[26:21] on.
[26:23] I can hardly wait. I know I'm almost
[26:26] home.
[26:28] [Music]
[26:39] When I reach those gates of glory, only
[26:43] then will I take rest. But the first
[26:46] thing I will do when I get home.
[26:51] I'll crawl up to my Jesus and I'll weep
[26:54] down at his feet. My source of joy, the
[26:58] savior of my soul.
[27:02] [Music]
[27:04] There's no time to waste my fleeting
[27:06] precious time.
[27:09] be setting weight with haste. I will
[27:12] swiftly cast aside.
[27:15] No time to stay or I'll keep pressing
[27:18] on.
[27:20] I can hardly wait. I know I'm almost
[27:23] home.
[27:24] Oh, there's no time to waste my fleeting
[27:27] precious time.
[27:30] Be setting weight with haste. I will
[27:32] swiftly cast aside.
[27:36] No time to stay. Oh, I'll keep pressing
[27:38] on.
[27:40] I can hardly wait. I know I'm almost
[27:43] home.
[27:45] No time to stay. Oh, I'll keep pressing
[27:48] on.
[27:50] I can hardly wait. I know I'm almost
[27:53] home.

[33:46] of God.
[33:52] I love your voice.
[33:54] [Music]
[33:56] You have led me through the fire
[34:02] in darkest nights.
[34:05] You were close like no other.
[34:10] I known you as a father.
[34:14] I known you as a friend.
[34:19] I have lived
[34:21] in the goodness
[34:23] of God.
[34:25] say
[34:29] and all my life you have been faithful.
[34:35] All my life
[34:37] [Music]
[34:39] you have been so so good.
[34:44] [Music]
[34:45] With every breath that I am able,

[34:54] of the goodness
[34:56] of God as brother Jason come. All my
[34:59] life
[35:02] and all my life you have been faith.
[35:06] [Music]
[35:07] All my life.
[35:13] So
[35:15] good.
[35:18] With every breath that I am,
[35:24] I will sing
[35:27] of the goodness
[35:29] of God. Say, "All my life
[35:34] and all my life you have been faith.
[35:39] All my life
[35:44] you have been so so good
[35:51] with every breath that I am able.
[35:57] I will sing
[35:59] of the goodness
[36:02] of God. Sing all my life
[36:07] and all my life you have been faithful.
[36:13] Sing
[36:15] all my life you have been so so good.
[36:23] With every breath that I am able,
[36:29] I will sing
[36:32] of the goodness.
[36:34] Oh God,
[36:36] say
[36:39] your goodness is running after, running
[36:43] after me.
[36:47] Your goodness is running after running
[36:51] after me.
[36:54] With my life laid down, I surrender now.
[36:58] I give you everything.
[37:03] Your goodness is running after, running
[37:07] after me.
[37:11] Your goodness is running after, running
[37:15] after me.
[37:20] Your goodness is running after, running
[37:24] after me.
[37:26] With my life laid down, I surrender now.
[37:30] I give you everything.
[37:35] Your goodness is running after. running
[37:39] after me. Your goodness.
[37:43] Your goodness is running after running
[37:48] after me.
[37:52] Your goodness is running after running
[37:56] after me.
[37:58] With my life laid down, I surrender now.
[38:03] I give you everything.
[38:08] Your goodness is running after
[38:11] running after me.
[38:16] [Applause]
[38:23] [Music]
[38:25] So glad for that. Amen. We're gonna
[38:27] invite you to Genesis chapter 3 this
[38:30] morning.
[38:32] Amen.
[38:35] Genesis chapter 3. I'm just going to um
[38:39] read um one or two verses here and um or
[38:43] maybe we'll we'll catch u we're going to
[38:45] start at verse 22. Genesis 3:22
[38:49] and we'll read through 24. We'll let you
[38:51] be seated and then I'll carry on
[38:53] reading.
[38:55] Amen. Praise the Lord. I'm looking
[38:57] forward to
[38:59] this series. I've been working on it for
[39:01] a while. We're going to start off with
[39:03] it today. And um I want to title it
[39:07] modern events again made clear in
[39:11] prophecy. Amen. So we're going to um
[39:15] look at how we got to here. We're going
[39:17] to identify here. Uh and that entails
[39:22] the not only the where but the what and
[39:25] the why and what it all means, what it
[39:28] entails and and how it should inform our
[39:32] thinking as we live in these closing
[39:35] scenes. How many believe we are in
[39:36] closing scenes?
[39:37] Amen.
[39:38] We are not at the end time. We are at
[39:40] the end of the end time.
[39:43] Amen. Genesis
[39:45] 3 verse 22.
[39:49] And the Lord God said, "Behold, the man
[39:52] is become as one of us to know good and
[39:56] evil. And now, lest he put forth his
[39:59] hand and take also of the tree of life,
[40:02] and eat and live forever."
[40:04] Therefore the Lord God sent him forth
[40:07] from the garden of Eden to till the
[40:10] ground from whence he was taken.
[40:13] So he drove out the man and he placed at
[40:17] the east of the garden of Eden cherubams
[40:21] and a flaming sword which turned every
[40:24] way to keep the way of the tree of life.
[40:29] Now keep your Bibles open. We're going
[40:31] to carry on into chapter four. But let's
[40:33] pray.
[40:35] Lord, we thank you for this time of
[40:38] divine privilege that you've given us to
[40:41] gather around the the feast of the word,
[40:44] Lord. And we have it on our heart,
[40:46] Father, as you have led me, and I felt
[40:49] definitely led to go in this direction.
[40:52] And Lord, we want to take some time and
[40:54] and and see our position in the word.
[40:57] And where are we in the word right now?
[41:00] We need to see you, Jesus. We must. That
[41:03] was exactly what you said. Every time a
[41:05] seal was open, come and see. And why
[41:08] wouldn't you say that? Because how can
[41:10] we how can we know you if we can't see
[41:13] you? How can we follow you? We must see
[41:16] your movements. We must detect. We must
[41:18] have our senses sharpened by the Holy
[41:21] Spirit in the word of God. This is a
[41:23] desperate time. It's a very perilous
[41:26] time, a desperate hour. And Lord, this
[41:28] is no time to uh be friends with the
[41:31] world. Lord, we must uh show our badge
[41:34] of identification that we are believers
[41:36] of the word of God. Many Lord are
[41:39] called, few are chosen. Many who you
[41:41] have called and chosen today, drifting
[41:44] around too close to the world, too
[41:46] close, Father, not sitting uh by the
[41:49] heat of the fire of the living God.
[41:51] Lord, the word that's a feast, seven
[41:54] course menu, I pray for them, Lord. I
[41:56] pray that you do something in their
[41:58] life, something in their in their in
[42:00] their in their heart that will quicken
[42:03] them to to realize, Lord, that they must
[42:05] be very near. Lord, the children of
[42:08] Israel were told, "You must stay very
[42:10] close because you have not went this way
[42:12] before." Though whenever the trumpet
[42:15] would sound, Lord, those they couldn't
[42:17] be somewhere way off wandering around in
[42:19] the desert away from the sound of the
[42:20] trumpet that the camp would leave and
[42:22] they would be left behind. And Lord, we
[42:24] must stay close to you.
[42:26] I pray that the distance that Satan has
[42:29] created in some of your children's
[42:30] hearts, that you will smash it by the
[42:33] Holy Spirit by whatever means necessary.
[42:36] Grant it, Lord, from the pull pit to the
[42:38] back door, across the stream, out
[42:40] through the way, Lord, anyone, Father,
[42:43] who is of your family, we commit it to
[42:45] you now in Jesus name. Amen. God bless
[42:49] you. You can be seated.
[43:17] Modern events
[43:19] again
[43:21] made clear in prophecy.
[43:25] Before I carry on in Revelation 4, I
[43:30] want to make a few qualifying statements
[43:32] that that they're going to be important
[43:34] to you to remember. And I mean to say
[43:37] keep them in the front of your mind.
[43:39] Don't put them somewhere in the back and
[43:41] forget or you are there's a lot that
[43:43] will be said and shown over these next
[43:46] number of services that will uh you
[43:49] won't be able to put all the pieces
[43:50] together even if you understand the
[43:52] pieces putting them together is all
[43:55] together different thing and I I just
[43:58] would like to say today that um this is
[44:01] a culmination of many years of study uh
[44:05] of God's word uh all the way back to
[44:08] just a young teenager, the Lord
[44:10] quickened my heart with a desire to
[44:12] study his word. And and I can say that
[44:16] that I am here today the beneficiary of
[44:20] sitting at the feet of some of the
[44:22] greatest teachers the message has ever
[44:24] had. Some of those fathers in the gospel
[44:27] to us have already gone on who lived in
[44:30] the days of the prophet and who who took
[44:32] it and carried it on after he went home.
[44:35] And so I've I've been privileged to sit
[44:38] at the feet of some great men and drink
[44:40] in knowledge and wisdom over the years.
[44:43] And uh and then of course we must
[44:46] realize that everything that that we
[44:50] teach and have been taught must dovetail
[44:53] with the message of the hour brought to
[44:55] us by Elijah without which we would have
[44:57] very little to say without which we
[44:59] would likely be 40,000 and one 40,0001st
[45:03] denominational
[45:05] organization and I don't want to be
[45:07] 40,000 and one I want to be the first
[45:10] original.
[45:11] Amen. So uh we are leaning heavy into
[45:15] things that brother Brandham taught us.
[45:16] We don't intend to teach anything that
[45:18] we can't either demonstrate by his
[45:21] direct teaching or his indirect teaching
[45:24] with a with with and when you say that
[45:26] you you got to realize that we're not
[45:29] we're not parrots. We don't just repeat
[45:31] what a prophet said. We're eagles.
[45:34] We teach what he taught. Now, it's quite
[45:36] it's quite possible and I've seen this
[45:38] done and I intend to avoid it uh in this
[45:42] series by the help of the Lord. I remain
[45:45] open to questions if anything is said
[45:47] that you don't quite understand,
[45:48] something you would like me to circle
[45:50] back to. I certainly welcome my ministry
[45:53] team uh to to ask any question uh openly
[45:57] or privately, not never. We love
[45:59] questions. Amen. I love teaching the
[46:01] word of God. I've taught it around the
[46:03] world. And so I uh you know I've seen it
[46:06] where where you can you can say a lot of
[46:11] things that brother Brandham said but at
[46:14] the end of the day you're not teaching
[46:16] what he taught.
[46:19] So there's a nuance there that has to be
[46:20] observed. You can daisy chain some
[46:23] quotes together just like I can daisy
[46:25] chain scriptures together and preach
[46:27] Baptist doctrine.
[46:29] And Baptist doctrine is is solid in many
[46:32] points. and and don't think they don't
[46:34] have counterarguments to your arguments
[46:36] and that's what you know apologetics is
[46:38] about and there are many great
[46:40] apologists but you know and I and I
[46:43] admire many of them you know today you
[46:45] can see many of their reels on YouTube
[46:47] and there seems to be no endless almost
[46:50] an endless stream of apologists getting
[46:52] on and and uh interpreting a Bible and I
[46:56] as much as I admire many of them I just
[46:59] say you know I wish and this is a word
[47:02] uh it's not exactly right uh in the in
[47:05] by by the definition. They're
[47:07] apologists. Uh and I just say to them, I
[47:09] wish you would start out I don't mind
[47:12] you being an apologist. I just wish you
[47:13] would start out with an apology for not
[47:15] believing all the word.
[47:17] And if you would start out at with an
[47:19] apology for not believing all the word,
[47:21] I could accept you as a proper
[47:23] apologist.
[47:26] Amen. So we're not looking for
[47:28] apologist. We're not looking for
[47:30] moralist. were not looking. Brother
[47:32] Brandham, you know, said those things
[47:34] have their place. They serve a purpose.
[47:36] And as brother Brandham said, many
[47:38] people misunderstand brother Brandham
[47:40] thinking he was against education. He
[47:42] said repeatedly, "I am not against
[47:44] education. I'm only warning people that
[47:47] the further you go in education, the
[47:49] further that's going to attempt to take
[47:50] you from the word of God."
[47:52] So you there's nothing wrong with
[47:54] learning and higher learning and
[47:55] advanced learning. I love learning. I'm
[47:58] I I I I am I'm I I you know I have many
[48:01] side hobbies of things that I study. Uh
[48:04] you know I I study science. I have a
[48:06] particular bent toward physics and the
[48:08] quantum world. I study history
[48:10] particularly ancient history and I
[48:12] correlate it uh through today. I'm a
[48:14] student of all of those disciplines. But
[48:17] but I but my but my whole aim is to
[48:20] study them as they relate to prophecy
[48:22] and the principles of God's word.
[48:24] Amen. So, I have preached on quantum
[48:27] mechanics. I have preached on
[48:28] entanglement and and these kinds of
[48:30] theories and chaos and relativity, but
[48:33] but I'm always preaching them because
[48:35] they started here.
[48:37] That's right.
[48:38] And God only allowed science to have a
[48:40] little bit of a window to see in. But
[48:42] here's the whole package. This is all
[48:44] the mystery.
[48:45] And and and this is this is encrypted.
[48:48] And there there's certain parts of it
[48:51] that anybody uh a child can read, you
[48:55] know, Acts 2:38,
[48:57] a child can understand. Brother Brandham
[48:59] said even a a child of 12 years old
[49:01] could understand the teaching of the
[49:03] original sin uh through the serpent's
[49:05] seed. Uh and and he would say baptism
[49:08] doesn't even require revelation. Men can
[49:11] read how to treat their wives and wives
[49:13] can read how to reverence their husbands
[49:15] and families can read how to raise
[49:17] children. And there's a lot of things
[49:18] and a lot of words of wisdom that are in
[49:21] the Bible that are that are not uh
[49:24] they're not encrypted and any anybody
[49:26] can read. Otherwise, God would never be
[49:28] able to judge them for failing to keep
[49:30] it.
[49:32] But but when it comes to the mystery of
[49:34] redemption, that's completely encrypted.
[49:38] There's no access. The only person that
[49:40] can understand that is he to whom the
[49:42] son will reveal it.
[49:45] See, and you say, "Well, okay, so
[49:48] there's only one thing, but it's the
[49:49] most critical thing."
[49:52] If you get that, you you get the, you
[49:54] know, Ruth was never sat here. I go
[49:56] preaching. Ruth was never satisfied with
[50:00] just getting the little handfuls of
[50:01] purpose left by the servants. She wanted
[50:04] Boaz cuz if she got to marry Boaz, she
[50:07] got the the whole field.
[50:10] She got everything.
[50:12] Amen. She wanted to be fed by him
[50:15] personally when he invited her into his
[50:17] tent for the meal. The Bible shows us
[50:20] how that he was seated there and his
[50:23] servants were with him and the grain was
[50:25] there. But the Bible says that he
[50:28] reached handfuls of of food and he
[50:32] didn't hand it to his servants pass this
[50:34] down. He reached right past them and
[50:36] handed it to her himself. Amen.
[50:39] Oh, when you're when you live in that
[50:41] tent, friends, when you when you when
[50:43] you go behind the veil,
[50:46] oh, brother Brandham said, you got a
[50:47] need. He said the golden pot of man is
[50:50] in there. You need s, you're sick, you
[50:51] need healing. Reach in that golden pot.
[50:54] Don't ask somebody to do it for you.
[50:55] Reach in it yourself and take something
[50:58] that'll bring healing.
[51:00] You need deliverance, there's
[51:01] deliverance in the word.
[51:04] So the word of God has many parts
[51:07] sufficient to judge the world by for
[51:09] humanity that doesn't keep them.
[51:11] But when it comes to the mystery of
[51:14] redemption, and I didn't call it that,
[51:15] Paul calls it that. Uh that requires
[51:19] insight from the Holy Spirit.
[51:21] Yes. Amen. And then to properly teach
[51:24] that to to people,
[51:27] you cannot have an apologist uh who just
[51:31] compares verse with verse.
[51:33] Brother Brandham said, "It'll take a
[51:34] special prophetic vessel, one that can
[51:38] receive direct inspiration, thus sayeth
[51:41] the Lord."
[51:42] It can't. The book of Revelation can't
[51:44] be known by a verse by verse study. It's
[51:47] helpful. I've done I spent three years
[51:49] more than a thousand days on online with
[51:52] uh with people around the world taking
[51:54] the entire book of Revelation verse by
[51:56] verse and we're trying to convert that
[51:59] into a study guide. It's an arduous task
[52:01] much larger and harder than I thought it
[52:03] would be but we're but we're working on
[52:05] it. And so so we but the point to be
[52:09] made is that it takes inspiration of the
[52:14] Holy Spirit.
[52:15] Amen. And let me just say this, and I I
[52:18] have to say this without apology because
[52:20] the Bible declares it and doesn't
[52:22] apologize for it. And while I'm not
[52:25] quoting a direct verse, I'm giving you a
[52:27] a something that the Bible teaches very
[52:30] clearly. It's one of those things where
[52:31] I'm not a parrot. I'm an eagle. Amen.
[52:34] And I'm going to teach you this that the
[52:36] Bible, a principle, a large looming
[52:38] principle in the body of the of of works
[52:41] that are the 66 books of the Bible is
[52:44] that inspiration
[52:46] for the new birth. Inspiration like that
[52:50] only comes to the inspiraable.
[52:53] Amen.
[52:54] Amen.
[52:55] Amen.
[52:56] Again, that's that's next level
[52:59] salvation. That's not just salvation
[53:01] from destruction. Many will be saved
[53:04] from destruction. The heavens will be
[53:06] filled with millions of people who are
[53:09] who are who are in heaven who are
[53:11] granted eternal life and who live in
[53:14] that glorious land along with us. But
[53:16] there is also a royal family
[53:18] who are known of God before the
[53:21] foundation of the world.
[53:22] Not just from
[53:24] Amen. Because the scripture in many
[53:26] cases speak about the remnant of the
[53:29] woman's seed in the book of revelation
[53:32] and they are whose names were written in
[53:34] the lamb's book of life because everyone
[53:37] who's not written in that book will be
[53:39] deceived by the antichrist spirit.
[53:41] So you say so you have to conclude that
[53:44] well then the foolish virgin are not
[53:46] fooled by it. They don't take the mark
[53:47] of the beast and they give their lives
[53:50] then then they must be in the lamb's
[53:51] book of life. They are, but their names
[53:54] were put there from the foundation of
[53:56] the world. Only Christ and his bride,
[54:00] there's only three places, and they
[54:02] refer to either Christ or his bride are
[54:06] part of the of the lamb's book of life
[54:09] before the foundation of the world.
[54:12] Amen.
[54:13] That's clear in the Bible.
[54:17] So, I know I'm taking a lot to lay a
[54:19] foundation, and I'm going to go slow.
[54:21] I'm going to take my time. I'm not going
[54:22] to weary you because especially with
[54:24] teaching, it's a lot to I don't want to
[54:26] oversponge you. So, so you don't have to
[54:28] worry about long sermons for the next
[54:31] little while. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[54:35] So, I I I just want to make these
[54:37] opening statements and I probably every
[54:39] time I get up here, I'll have to make
[54:41] some opening statements. Here's
[54:43] something I would like to say. And again
[54:44] before we get on with chapter 4
[54:47] that that prophecy when it's studied
[54:52] uh it can't be
[54:54] thought of as like for instance reading
[54:57] a newspaper or reading a book because
[55:00] you'd start from the front and go to the
[55:02] back. You'd you you'd start at the
[55:04] beginning and go to the end. And then
[55:06] when you're reading a newspaper, it's
[55:07] true that you skip through but you're
[55:10] you're only looking for information.
[55:12] That's all the paper's giving you is
[55:14] information. That's all it's supposed to
[55:15] be giving you.
[55:17] And so, and so we we find that when it
[55:20] comes to the to the biblical book of
[55:23] Revelation,
[55:24] first of all, you can't study it or make
[55:27] sense of it if you read it like a book
[55:30] chronologically. It's not laid out that
[55:32] way.
[55:34] There'll be events in in a later chapter
[55:36] that happened prior to a previous
[55:38] chapter. And there'll be a previous
[55:40] chapter to a later chapter that'll
[55:42] leaprog and repeat two or three times.
[55:45] You'll say, "Well, I thought it was
[55:46] here." It was. Well, you're saying it's
[55:49] here. Yeah. And here, correct?
[55:51] Yes.
[55:51] See, so so this is why, you know, that
[55:55] that man would make a comment to brother
[55:57] Brandham, which Brother Brandham, you
[55:58] know, upgraded him for, saying, "John
[56:00] must have ate a hot chili pepper before
[56:02] going to bed that night." And brother
[56:04] Brandham said he was a fine man, a
[56:05] Christian man. And he said, but he said,
[56:07] and he said, and I could have got fired.
[56:09] He was my boss. And I just said, "Aren't
[56:10] you ashamed to say something like that?
[56:12] You don't believe that the Holy Spirit
[56:14] was the the the book of Revelation says
[56:17] the Holy Spirit wrote it.
[56:19] It's the revelation of Jesus Christ.
[56:22] See, which God gave to him and he
[56:23] brought to his servant."
[56:25] See, to give to the people.
[56:27] So, you know, it might look topsyturvy
[56:31] to you, to the world, but Jesus isn't
[56:34] topsyturvy. Amen.
[56:35] He's a god of precision and order.
[56:38] See?
[56:38] Amen.
[56:39] All right. So, so, so, so, and then the
[56:41] second thing is
[56:44] prophecy is not just information.
[56:47] Amen.
[56:48] A lot of people study prophecy because
[56:51] they just want information.
[56:53] They'd like to increase their
[56:55] theological understanding of prophe of
[56:58] prophetic events. And it's it's it's
[57:00] it's it's
[57:02] uh you know, they almost have a like,
[57:04] oh, this is really good, man. They they
[57:06] just get like an appetite for it.
[57:09] And you know, and uh and it's not really
[57:12] like that. It's not just information.
[57:15] When you're understanding prophecy,
[57:17] you're understanding it to see where you
[57:20] are in it. Cuz I promise you are in it.
[57:23] See, even the parts written back in the
[57:26] Old Testament say, "I wasn't even
[57:27] there." Well, neither was Jesus of
[57:29] Nazareth there in a human body, but it
[57:31] was him, and I was in him.
[57:34] See, Brother Brandon would say that if
[57:37] you can't read Jesus Christ in every
[57:40] verse of the Bible,
[57:42] go back and read it again. You missed
[57:44] it. Amen.
[57:46] All right. That takes some qualifying
[57:48] because because I can read
[57:52] places in the Bible that are heinous
[57:55] events,
[57:57] terrible, sinful,
[58:00] uh uh you know, I I can read about near,
[58:02] you know, cultural genocide and filthy
[58:07] adulteries and and and incestuous and
[58:11] and perversions. And I say, "How uh
[58:15] Jesus w didn't do any of those things."
[58:18] See, Jesus lived perfectly. He never
[58:21] committed any of those sins. But you and
[58:24] I did
[58:25] and have and he took my sins upon him
[58:29] and gave me his sinless life. So yes, I
[58:32] read him in every verse of the Bible.
[58:36] Amen.
[58:37] Even if I'm only reading what he
[58:39] delivered me from,
[58:41] that's him.
[58:46] So, you need to see yourself
[58:50] so that you can know with clarity
[58:55] what is God's expectation of you.
[58:59] Now, we've been proving to you he has an
[59:01] expectation. We've been proving to you
[59:03] in our previous little miniseries almost
[59:05] I three parts three four five whatever
[59:07] parts probably a small one but we've
[59:10] been proving that he has a sheet music
[59:12] he wants your life to play back to him
[59:14] as music.
[59:14] Amen.
[59:15] He wants your life to be a living voice.
[59:18] So this is not about data or information
[59:21] or giving us better theology than the
[59:24] apologist on YouTube.
[59:26] We do have better theology. uh they have
[59:29] more education and they have degrees.
[59:31] But what they don't realize and what I
[59:33] would like to just sit down very humbly
[59:35] and say to them, my dear brother, that
[59:38] that degree on your wall that you're so
[59:41] proud of, I'm sorry to say, is actually
[59:44] the thing that's hindering you.
[59:46] You're so proud of it. And it's the it's
[59:48] your greatest enemy because it only it
[59:51] only gave you rope memory. It taught you
[59:54] what to think, not how to think. See,
[59:57] but the revelation of the Holy Spirit
[1:00:00] teaches me how to interpret his word. It
[1:00:03] came to me through a prophet who didn't
[1:00:05] just teach me what to think, but how to
[1:00:07] think, not and so I'm not a parrot. I
[1:00:10] don't always just repeat his words, but
[1:00:12] I can use how he taught me to study the
[1:00:14] word. And as long as I can dovetail it
[1:00:18] in the word from Genesis to Revelation
[1:00:20] and the quotes,
[1:00:21] then I know I'm on the right path.
[1:00:24] Amen.
[1:00:26] Amen.
[1:00:26] Amen.
[1:00:28] So this is why you need a five-fold
[1:00:31] ministry.
[1:00:33] It's what this is why God put them in
[1:00:37] the earth. That's why it's there for
[1:00:40] I think like the rest of the world. And
[1:00:42] I think like the Bible thinks that it's
[1:00:44] really foolishness.
[1:00:46] Men, fallen men preaching to fallen men.
[1:00:49] Come on.
[1:00:50] An imperfect man trying to get an
[1:00:52] imperfect people perfect.
[1:00:55] So the whole thing is nonsensical to me.
[1:00:57] I just say blessed be the name of the
[1:00:58] Lord. He He knows what he's doing.
[1:01:01] Amen.
[1:01:03] And if there was anything that William
[1:01:04] Brandham stood for, and that is the an
[1:01:06] active five-fold ministry, a local
[1:01:08] assembly
[1:01:10] with pastors and evangelists and
[1:01:11] teachers and and and and apostles and
[1:01:15] and prophets and all of these things.
[1:01:17] and therefore the perfecting of the
[1:01:18] bride. So until she's perfect and gone,
[1:01:21] you still need that.
[1:01:23] Amen.
[1:01:24] See,
[1:01:25] if he would have wanted you to just stay
[1:01:28] home and play a tape or assemble at a
[1:01:31] building and just play a tape, then a
[1:01:33] prophet would have said that. Right.
[1:01:36] The reason that preachers, regardless of
[1:01:39] what their surname is, I'm not here to
[1:01:40] condemn someone,
[1:01:42] but the reason people get in a pull pit
[1:01:45] and preach that you don't need
[1:01:46] preachers, is because if they could just
[1:01:49] find a tape that said that, they
[1:01:51] wouldn't need to preach for a half an
[1:01:52] hour telling you you don't need
[1:01:53] preachers.
[1:01:56] The problem is, I feel sorry for them. I
[1:01:58] understand why they have to do it
[1:01:59] because they can't they can't just push
[1:02:00] play and get you to hear that. So they
[1:02:02] have to preach that to you and then tell
[1:02:05] you to push play and do what and and and
[1:02:07] and do what's on the tape. Exactly what
[1:02:09] we're doing today. What's on the tape,
[1:02:11] right?
[1:02:12] See,
[1:02:13] so you should listen to the tape. Well,
[1:02:15] I just say to them that you're not
[1:02:16] listening to the tape. If you are,
[1:02:17] you're not hearing it.
[1:02:19] You've got somehow got selective
[1:02:20] hearing. Yes.
[1:02:25] So, so when we look at Hebrews 13:8,
[1:02:30] it's a profound scripture and it it is
[1:02:34] why that brother Brandham had it as a
[1:02:36] main theme of the William Brandham
[1:02:38] Evangelistic Association. It was on his
[1:02:40] tent. You see pictures of his tent.
[1:02:42] Hebrews 13:8. It was a major point that
[1:02:45] William Brandham stood on all of his
[1:02:47] life. and and and the reason that
[1:02:50] Hebrews 13:8 is proven true and the and
[1:02:55] and and necessary
[1:02:58] and is the and is the single most
[1:03:01] relevant reality at the end time and why
[1:03:05] it is stressed so hard is that Christ is
[1:03:10] to be the living word in every age.
[1:03:15] Amen. That's why Hebrews 13:8 is so
[1:03:19] important because he's the living word
[1:03:22] in every age. See? So, so this is why it
[1:03:27] becomes so necessary. I'm just I can
[1:03:29] just feel myself trying to go down
[1:03:31] rabbit holes. I don't want to do that.
[1:03:33] Let me just stay stious along my notes
[1:03:35] today.
[1:03:38] So you can read it, you know, you can't
[1:03:42] uh as I said, you can't just read it as
[1:03:44] data and information. You can't just
[1:03:47] read it in chronological order.
[1:03:50] Clearly, the book of Revelation is the
[1:03:52] bride's book at the end time. And that's
[1:03:54] my own saying. I maybe I heard it
[1:03:57] somewhere. I'm basically just saying
[1:03:59] that's not a direct quote on a tape, but
[1:04:02] we understand this by everything that a
[1:04:04] prophet taught us. The book of
[1:04:06] Revelation was written after the first
[1:04:09] church age prophet messenger had gone
[1:04:11] home. When John came back with it, Paul
[1:04:14] was long gone.
[1:04:15] This is exactly why nowhere does Paul
[1:04:17] ever quote from the book of Revelation.
[1:04:20] Amen.
[1:04:21] However, the book of Revelation quotes
[1:04:23] probably is is made up probably at least
[1:04:26] three quarters to say the least uh of
[1:04:29] what was first said in the book of
[1:04:30] Daniel.
[1:04:31] Amen.
[1:04:32] Daniel fills up probably 75% of the book
[1:04:36] of Revelation. And here here's a here's
[1:04:40] something to observe. So that so that we
[1:04:43] know then that that that Paul doesn't
[1:04:47] quote from the book of Revelation. But
[1:04:50] when a prophet goes there and preaches
[1:04:52] on the book of revelation in the church
[1:04:55] ages in the seals and when the seals are
[1:04:59] open when feast of trumpets when and his
[1:05:02] series on revelation 3 4 and 5 every
[1:05:05] time when the seals are open or the
[1:05:06] trumpets are preached on or revelation
[1:05:08] is preached on it's a teaching directly
[1:05:11] what Paul taught
[1:05:13] even though Paul never read the book.
[1:05:15] Amen.
[1:05:16] See?
[1:05:18] All right. So, I I just want to make
[1:05:21] those points and get that in your mind
[1:05:24] and and I you'll probably hear me
[1:05:27] reiterate it much more quickly. I'm
[1:05:29] taking a lot of time this morning. It's
[1:05:31] okay. Uh but I'll I'll constantly repeat
[1:05:35] myself and I'll say things like that.
[1:05:38] Remember the Hebrews 13:8 rule.
[1:05:40] Remember why you're learning, not
[1:05:42] information. You're learning to be.
[1:05:45] Amen.
[1:05:45] See, you're learning that you may
[1:05:47] become.
[1:05:48] Amen.
[1:05:48] All right. You're learning so that you
[1:05:51] can see your time and position. So you
[1:05:53] know what God's expectation is of you.
[1:05:57] And
[1:05:58] may I say, and it should be to your
[1:06:01] delight, your the whole advantage of
[1:06:04] understanding your day and its message
[1:06:06] and your part in it and what's up
[1:06:09] is is that it banishes fear. Amen.
[1:06:14] You don't have to worry
[1:06:15] because I know what's up. I know why
[1:06:17] it's happening. The world is fearful of
[1:06:19] what's happening. They don't understand
[1:06:21] it.
[1:06:22] But not not just I've read the back of
[1:06:24] the book and I know we win. All true. We
[1:06:26] Yeah. You know, hooray over that. But
[1:06:28] but all the way through it, I can see
[1:06:30] myself walking through the scripture.
[1:06:35] So it is the and that's why brother
[1:06:36] Brandon would say there is no prevailing
[1:06:40] power so great as revelation
[1:06:43] to give you power over the in over the
[1:06:46] devil over the world over sin and over
[1:06:49] your flesh. I'd like to have that kind
[1:06:51] of power.
[1:06:52] I don't need to create squirrels or
[1:06:54] speak storms out of existence or walk on
[1:06:57] water but I'd very much like to defeat
[1:06:59] my flesh and the world and the devil.
[1:07:02] Hallelujah.
[1:07:05] Amen.
[1:07:05] So if I can hook into a prevailing
[1:07:07] power, plug me in.
[1:07:10] Amen.
[1:07:10] Hook me up and turn the juice to max.
[1:07:18] So
[1:07:20] our scene opened
[1:07:22] with man being driven from
[1:07:26] the Garden of Eden.
[1:07:29] And so I want to I want to pick up verse
[1:07:31] four.
[1:07:32] But before I do that, if you'll indulge
[1:07:35] me just a moment. Whoops, wrong.
[1:07:41] Um,
[1:07:46] and is that where I want to be? Ah, it
[1:07:50] is.
[1:07:52] So
[1:07:55] that's why. Okay. Okay. You're not going
[1:07:57] to find a quote in Genesis in
[1:07:59] Revelation. You're going to have to go
[1:08:01] to Genesis. Go to the top. There it is.
[1:08:04] Click on it. Good boy. Okay.
[1:08:08] Now it's making uh Now I once was blind,
[1:08:12] but now I see. Okay.
[1:08:16] So, I want to I want to read you what we
[1:08:18] read, and I want to read it from the New
[1:08:21] Living Translation. All right. So, so
[1:08:24] listen to this again.
[1:08:27] Then the Lord God said, "Look, the human
[1:08:31] beings have become like us, knowing both
[1:08:33] good and evil.
[1:08:36] What if they reach out, take fruit from
[1:08:38] the tree of life, and eat it?" See, then
[1:08:40] they'd live in a in fallen condition,
[1:08:42] they'd have eternal life.
[1:08:43] Yeah.
[1:08:44] And they eat it. Then they'll live
[1:08:46] forever. So the Lord God banished them
[1:08:49] from the Garden of Eden, and he sent
[1:08:50] Adam out to cultivate the ground from
[1:08:52] whence from which he had been made.
[1:08:55] After sending them out, the Lord God
[1:08:58] stationed mighty cherubam to the east of
[1:09:00] the Garden of Eden. And he placed a
[1:09:03] flaming sword that flashed back and
[1:09:05] forth to guard the way to the tree of
[1:09:08] life. All right? So now remember this
[1:09:12] point that that the that the way to the
[1:09:16] tree of life is not a trail or a path.
[1:09:19] It's the way of the tree of life. It's a
[1:09:22] brother Brandham said they couldn't even
[1:09:24] directly partake of it at that time
[1:09:25] because it hadn't been made flesh. So
[1:09:27] it's Christ.
[1:09:28] So it's a revelation of Christ. Again
[1:09:31] that's encrypted. That's only going to
[1:09:33] be given to those whom the Lord will
[1:09:35] reveal it to.
[1:09:36] So to keep that true, he shoot them out
[1:09:39] of the garden. get out because I can't
[1:09:40] let you I can't take a chance that you
[1:09:42] could you could breach my word. So, I'm
[1:09:45] going to drive you from uh the Garden of
[1:09:47] Eden. All right. Now,
[1:09:50] now we pick up back into our King James
[1:09:52] and and in Revelation 4.
[1:09:56] And Abel,
[1:09:58] he also brought
[1:10:01] I'm sorry, uh and verse one. And Adam
[1:10:04] knew Eve his wife, and she conceived and
[1:10:07] bare Cain,
[1:10:10] and said, "I have gotten a man from the
[1:10:12] Lord." This is the opening scene.
[1:10:15] This is act one, scene one.
[1:10:17] Amen.
[1:10:18] Of mankind after the fall.
[1:10:21] And Adam knew Eve his wife, and she
[1:10:24] conceived and bare Cain, and said, "I
[1:10:26] have gotten a man from the Lord." And
[1:10:29] she again bare his brother Abel. And
[1:10:31] Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was
[1:10:34] a tiller of the ground. Even theologians
[1:10:36] agree that second verse in all
[1:10:38] probability means they were twins. No
[1:10:41] kidding. Verse three. And in the process
[1:10:44] of time, it came to pass that Cain
[1:10:47] brought of the fruit of the ground an
[1:10:49] offering unto the Lord. And Abel he also
[1:10:53] brought of the firstlings of his flock,
[1:10:55] and of the fat thereof. And the Lord had
[1:10:58] respect unto Abel and to his offering,
[1:11:01] but unto Cain, and to his offering he
[1:11:03] had not respect. And Cain was very
[1:11:05] wroth, and his countenance fell. And the
[1:11:08] Lord said unto Cain, "Why art thou
[1:11:10] wroth? And why is thy countenance
[1:11:12] fallen? If thou doest well, shalt thou
[1:11:14] not be accepted? And if thou doest not
[1:11:18] well, sin lith at the door? And unto
[1:11:21] thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt
[1:11:24] rule over him."
[1:11:26] And Cain talked with Abel his brother.
[1:11:30] And it came to pass when they were in
[1:11:33] the field that Cain rose up against Abel
[1:11:36] his brother and slew him.
[1:11:40] All right. Now,
[1:11:45] so I I want you to notice
[1:11:48] and and again, I've got to lay this
[1:11:50] foundation because when I start getting
[1:11:53] to examples, and we're going to look at
[1:11:55] Ezekiel and Daniel and Revelation, and
[1:11:58] we're going to we're going to walk you
[1:11:59] through prophecy. Uh we're going to
[1:12:02] start back, you know, and bring it all
[1:12:04] forward o over time and and in in
[1:12:06] services coming. Uh but but today it's
[1:12:09] just so important I lay some of these
[1:12:11] fundamental rules of of of observation
[1:12:14] and we'll observe them as we go and I'll
[1:12:16] note them as the Holy Spirit gives me
[1:12:18] uncction. But I want you to notice that
[1:12:23] that first of all
[1:12:26] can Cain
[1:12:28] his offering is rejected.
[1:12:30] Amen.
[1:12:31] He's angry.
[1:12:34] His countenance shows it.
[1:12:36] Yes. Amen.
[1:12:37] Uh
[1:12:39] and and God says to him, "Look, if
[1:12:43] you'll just do some works, there can be
[1:12:46] a way made for you." Now, you you're not
[1:12:47] going to be able to earn your way into
[1:12:49] heaven, but I will take into account how
[1:12:52] your heart responds to my word.
[1:12:55] Amen.
[1:12:56] Amen.
[1:12:56] See, now that's why you see that in
[1:12:58] Matthew 25 because you've got a whole
[1:13:01] group of people who are claiming their
[1:13:03] works. And the king is not denying their
[1:13:06] works, only that they were done in
[1:13:08] iniquity because their heart wasn't
[1:13:10] right.
[1:13:11] And they're now trying to stand on the
[1:13:14] fact that we have did works in your
[1:13:16] name. And why wouldn't they? They had
[1:13:18] spent their whole Christian lifetime in
[1:13:20] the earth trying to convince people by
[1:13:23] their works.
[1:13:24] Amen.
[1:13:24] So why wouldn't they try it now? It had
[1:13:26] worked in the earth. People thought they
[1:13:28] were Christians. They actually weren't
[1:13:29] even converted at all. And even the
[1:13:31] works they did, though notable and not
[1:13:33] denied by the king, didn't count
[1:13:36] because he was looking at their heart.
[1:13:39] The other group of people didn't even
[1:13:41] remember doing any good works. But it
[1:13:43] was their heart's response whenever they
[1:13:46] came face to face with the word in
[1:13:48] whatever form he revealed it.
[1:13:51] Amen.
[1:13:53] Cain was never going to get Abel's
[1:13:56] revelation.
[1:13:58] But God provides a legitimate
[1:14:00] opportunity for every human to save
[1:14:03] himself from destruction.
[1:14:06] To be just, he has to do that.
[1:14:08] But if you'll notice, none of these
[1:14:10] conditions are put upon Abel. Abel had
[1:14:15] one requirement. Believe the revelation.
[1:14:18] Amen.
[1:14:19] That was it. Amen.
[1:14:20] God didn't give him any other conditions
[1:14:22] but believe the revelation because if he
[1:14:24] believed the revelation it he would
[1:14:27] hear, recognize and act upon the word
[1:14:31] and bring his lamb.
[1:14:32] Amen.
[1:14:34] See that's what Cain wouldn't do.
[1:14:37] He wouldn't hear and and act on the
[1:14:40] word. He wouldn't hear recognize and act
[1:14:42] on the word. So he went his own way. And
[1:14:44] brother Brandham said he just he just
[1:14:45] brought his own labors to God and said,
[1:14:47] you know, take it or leave it. That's a
[1:14:49] bad position to be in.
[1:14:51] Amen.
[1:14:52] Because God can just say, "Okay, never
[1:14:54] mind. Go away."
[1:14:56] And that's what you don't want to hear.
[1:14:59] Amen.
[1:15:02] So, you can already see the difference
[1:15:06] made in the opening act, scene one
[1:15:11] of mankind in in after the fall.
[1:15:16] Now this of course
[1:15:18] um
[1:15:20] you know when when he says here in verse
[1:15:22] 8 and Cain talked with Abel his brother
[1:15:25] and it came to pass when they were in
[1:15:26] the field that Cain rose up against Abel
[1:15:29] his brother and slew him. So there was
[1:15:33] some reason that Abel had no fear to go
[1:15:37] out walking out alone with his brother
[1:15:40] that he talked. They had talked all
[1:15:42] kinds of times. Abel knew Cain. Cain
[1:15:45] knew Abel. And and so just understand
[1:15:48] the point I want to make is friends, I
[1:15:50] know that we're in the world. And Paul
[1:15:53] said, you know, we we can't totally be
[1:15:56] disconnected from the world unless we go
[1:15:57] out of the world. God doesn't want us to
[1:15:59] go live in a commune. That's not its
[1:16:00] plan. His plan is that I've sent you out
[1:16:03] as sheep among wolves. But just
[1:16:05] understand that that world that you can
[1:16:08] sometimes, hear me, that you can
[1:16:10] sometimes get a little too connected and
[1:16:12] friendly with, it cost you something.
[1:16:16] Because I promise you, when it comes
[1:16:18] down to the word of God, they will not
[1:16:20] choose the word of God.
[1:16:22] Amen.
[1:16:23] They will seek to kill Christ. They did.
[1:16:26] They do it again at the end time. And as
[1:16:28] soon as they killed Christ, as soon as
[1:16:30] they had the spirit of murder satisfied
[1:16:32] against Jesus, they never turned that to
[1:16:35] his disciples until after they did it to
[1:16:37] him.
[1:16:38] Then they turned it to his disciples.
[1:16:41] That's why they, you know, why Thomas
[1:16:45] was killed by having a javelin run
[1:16:48] through him from behind, stabbed him in
[1:16:49] the back, literally pierced, harpooned
[1:16:52] him while he's praying. That's why uh
[1:16:55] Matthew was filleted.
[1:17:00] They took a fillet knife and removed his
[1:17:03] skin while he was alive.
[1:17:05] They hung Peter upside down. They took
[1:17:08] Luke the physician. Friend, I don't even
[1:17:10] want to go down. They they drugg him
[1:17:12] through the streets until they died.
[1:17:13] They uh they they killed them in in
[1:17:16] horrible ways. These were good people.
[1:17:18] Say, "I'm I'm a good person. Nobody is
[1:17:21] going to harm me." We're not talking
[1:17:22] about the person. We're talking about
[1:17:24] the spirit they're anointed with.
[1:17:30] So Cain talked with his brother and it
[1:17:33] came to pass when they were in the field
[1:17:34] that Cain rose up against Abel his
[1:17:36] brother and slew him. So this of course
[1:17:39] is the exact fate Satan with his forces
[1:17:43] desired uh when we are told in the book
[1:17:47] of in the book of Revelation chapter 12.
[1:17:49] Let's go to 12 7-12. Brother Caleb,
[1:17:53] you can see that that Satan that what
[1:17:56] Cain did was exactly what Satan tried to
[1:18:01] do. And here we find it in Revelation
[1:18:03] 12:7 to12 because this is war that
[1:18:07] started in heaven. The war you're
[1:18:08] fighting today.
[1:18:10] Amen.
[1:18:10] We wrestle not against flesh and blood,
[1:18:13] principalities, powers of darkness.
[1:18:14] Amen. That war started in heaven. Now,
[1:18:18] when you read chapter 12 of of
[1:18:22] Revelation, you're going, "Yeah, okay.
[1:18:25] So, Revelation 10, so then the bride
[1:18:27] goes in the rapture. Revelation 11 is
[1:18:30] Moses and Elijah." So, then chapter 12
[1:18:32] must be all in the tribulation. Parts of
[1:18:34] it are, parts of it aren't.
[1:18:36] Parts of it are both.
[1:18:37] Yes. Amen. Part of part of this both is
[1:18:40] that this battle where you where you
[1:18:43] read Satan kicked out and and it sent it
[1:18:46] into the earth and it's a greatest
[1:18:48] battle ever fought for the control of
[1:18:50] the man of uh control of mankind's mind
[1:18:54] and we're fighting it now
[1:18:56] and yet it doesn't even speak of it till
[1:18:58] Revelation 12.
[1:19:00] See,
[1:19:02] so there was war in heaven. Verse seven,
[1:19:06] Michael, this of course is
[1:19:08] representative of Christ. Michael and
[1:19:09] his angels because the angels don't
[1:19:11] belong to anybody but Christ. Michael
[1:19:13] and his angels fought against the
[1:19:15] dragon. And the dragon fought and his
[1:19:17] angels and prevailed not. Neither was
[1:19:20] their place found anymore in heaven. And
[1:19:23] the great dragon was cast out, that old
[1:19:26] serpent called the devil and Satan. Boy,
[1:19:28] he's going to make sure we know who he's
[1:19:29] talking about. Which deceiveth the whole
[1:19:32] world. He was cast out into the earth.
[1:19:35] And his angels were cast out with him.
[1:19:38] And I heard a loud voice saying in
[1:19:40] heaven, "Now is come salvation and
[1:19:43] strength and the kingdom of our God and
[1:19:45] the power of his Christ. For the accuser
[1:19:48] of our brethren is cast down which
[1:19:50] accused them before go before our God
[1:19:53] day and night." So he's literally,
[1:19:56] Brother Brandham said, when the bride
[1:19:57] goes up, he comes down.
[1:20:00] And and now the the angels say to the
[1:20:03] world, "Woe unto you for Satan has come
[1:20:06] down to you." And so there one woe has
[1:20:09] passed. Two woes have passed and one is
[1:20:12] still coming. So now he's coming down
[1:20:14] and the tribulation is underway and
[1:20:16] Satan is going to come down and
[1:20:18] incarnate the false prophet.
[1:20:21] So that h that will be whatever pope
[1:20:23] happens to be seated uh on on the throne
[1:20:26] at that time. I don't well is it
[1:20:28] Francis? I don't know. He might die
[1:20:30] before I finish this sermon. But what
[1:20:32] whatever pope is active at that time,
[1:20:34] that false prophet, Satan will incarnate
[1:20:37] him. And that's why the that the beast
[1:20:40] will become the incarnate beast.
[1:20:43] He'll now be he'll be he'll be Lucifer
[1:20:47] personified in a human being
[1:20:50] and and his angels take all the rest of
[1:20:53] the people who were preached into the
[1:20:58] tribulation. Amen.
[1:20:59] Brother Brandham showed us in the seals,
[1:21:01] how does the false prophet get all of
[1:21:04] these billions of people to go with him
[1:21:06] into the tribulation instead of the
[1:21:08] rapture? He preaches them right into it.
[1:21:11] Amen.
[1:21:12] So, literally, they're being preached to
[1:21:14] become an incarnate demon.
[1:21:17] What if God takes the word of God and
[1:21:20] gives it to you and you believe it? Do
[1:21:22] you not become the incarnate word for
[1:21:25] your hour?
[1:21:27] If that causes them to come down and be
[1:21:29] destroyed, won't it cause you to go up
[1:21:31] and live?
[1:21:36] And I heard, here it is again, verse 10.
[1:21:40] And I heard a loud voice saying, "In
[1:21:42] heaven, now is come salvation and
[1:21:44] strength and the kingdom of our God and
[1:21:47] the power of his Christ."
[1:21:50] Make sure I didn't skip something. And
[1:21:51] the power of his Christ. For the accuser
[1:21:53] of our brethren is cast down, which
[1:21:55] accused them before our God day and
[1:21:57] night. Now, there's a plot twist.
[1:22:00] Don't you love a good plot twist? Think
[1:22:03] you got it figured out. Oh, no. He
[1:22:06] didn't just do that.
[1:22:10] Verse 11.
[1:22:12] And they overcame him by the blood of
[1:22:14] the lamb. This is God's redeemed. They
[1:22:16] overcame him by the blood of the lamb
[1:22:19] and by the word of their testimony. and
[1:22:22] they loved not their lives unto death.
[1:22:24] Therefore, rejoice ye heavens and ye
[1:22:29] that dwell in them. Say, "This is
[1:22:31] terrible. Satan has come down to the
[1:22:33] earth. It's a tribulation. Why would I
[1:22:34] rejoice?" Because the bride has been
[1:22:36] delivered.
[1:22:37] All of heaven is rejoicing. It's over.
[1:22:41] Hallelujah.
[1:22:42] G.
[1:22:45] So, so we're seeing that
[1:22:49] that the plot twist and I and I'll just
[1:22:53] I'll just give you a quick clue
[1:22:56] that you you're going to realize that um
[1:23:00] this vital clue, this vital what I'm
[1:23:03] calling a plot twist,
[1:23:05] first of all, it's not described
[1:23:08] in detail
[1:23:10] until the end of the Bible,
[1:23:13] halfway through the 12th chapter.
[1:23:15] no less halfway through the book of
[1:23:18] Revelation, halfway through the chapter.
[1:23:22] And and we find out that that that that
[1:23:26] the that victory
[1:23:29] in the kingdom of Christ. How many want
[1:23:32] it?
[1:23:33] It comes through anguish,
[1:23:36] tribulation,
[1:23:39] and overcoming.
[1:23:40] Amen.
[1:23:42] Victory in the kingdom of Christ comes
[1:23:45] through trial, anguish, tribulation, and
[1:23:49] overcoming. That's why he says they
[1:23:53] overcame him by the blood of the lamb
[1:23:56] and by the word of their testimony. So
[1:23:58] it was a lived life.
[1:24:02] Wasn't just lip service. They gave their
[1:24:04] lives.
[1:24:05] Amen.
[1:24:05] For the cause of Christ. Some of them
[1:24:07] dying in heinous ways. They loved not
[1:24:10] their lives unto death.
[1:24:14] Because they did that, they get to
[1:24:16] rejoice.
[1:24:18] When the rest of the world is to say,
[1:24:21] "Whoa, whoa, whoa." There's a bride
[1:24:26] rejoicing because she loved not her life
[1:24:30] unto death.
[1:24:31] Brother Brandham
[1:24:34] in 1963 in the message humble thyself
[1:24:37] he's telling a story. I can actually
[1:24:38] only find him telling this one time but
[1:24:40] it's significant to me because it's from
[1:24:42] a sermon in 1963
[1:24:45] uh in July after the seals. So, so, so
[1:24:50] since it's after the seals, then what
[1:24:52] I'm about to read you is the prophet
[1:24:54] further building on top of the
[1:24:56] revelation of Jesus Christ because
[1:24:58] that's what the seals are all about.
[1:24:59] Amen. So now the story you're about to
[1:25:02] hear say, "Oh, goody. I get to hear more
[1:25:06] about the revelation of Jesus Christ."
[1:25:09] But but what what the seals unveiled
[1:25:13] to to the shock and dismay of the devil
[1:25:18] to the astonishment of the bride and to
[1:25:22] the blindness of the world is that when
[1:25:25] the seals opened and it revealed Christ
[1:25:28] suddenly it revealed a word born bride
[1:25:32] who was not the son of Charles and Ella
[1:25:34] Brham who was not part of a
[1:25:36] denominational system who had come out
[1:25:38] of her my people.
[1:25:40] See, so there's no chance to hear the
[1:25:43] call come up if you're not willing to
[1:25:46] hear come out.
[1:25:47] Amen.
[1:25:48] You'll never hear come up.
[1:25:51] Be as good a person as you want.
[1:25:53] Believe God sent a prophet. Believe
[1:25:55] Jesus is the son of God. Believe all the
[1:25:57] message is true. But if you're not
[1:25:58] willing to come out of the world, you
[1:26:00] will never hear come up higher.
[1:26:02] See,
[1:26:05] you have to hear, recognize, and act on
[1:26:07] the word.
[1:26:10] So now listen to this story that brother
[1:26:12] Brandham is going to use
[1:26:15] in July of 1963.
[1:26:18] And he says, "My brother back there was
[1:26:21] telling me a story today about a
[1:26:22] minister, one of his congregation. He
[1:26:25] said he could walk a log." He said,
[1:26:27] "Pastor," the pastor said, "I can walk a
[1:26:30] log." And the pas a and he said,
[1:26:33] "Pastor, sure, the Lord is with you."
[1:26:37] And the pastor said,"I can pack a log
[1:26:39] across my back when I go across." "Sure,
[1:26:42] pastor, the Lord is with you." And he
[1:26:44] went and done it.
[1:26:47] He said, "Pastor said, "I can pack a log
[1:26:51] and wheel a wheelbarrow across at the
[1:26:53] same time." "Sure, pastor. The Lord is
[1:26:56] with you. Your faith can do anything."
[1:26:59] And the pastor said, "I can put you in
[1:27:01] the wheelbarrow and pack the log." And
[1:27:03] he said, "Now wait a minute.
[1:27:07] Wait a minute. Oh, wait. Hold on. Wait a
[1:27:10] minute.
[1:27:13] He said, see, it's different when you're
[1:27:16] included in it yourself. Now, that it's
[1:27:21] mighty good for us to say here, amen.
[1:27:25] It's mighty good for us to say, I
[1:27:27] believe that's true.
[1:27:29] But then put it in action. You got to
[1:27:34] put it in action.
[1:27:35] Amen.
[1:27:36] Let me give you that butchering of the
[1:27:39] king's English again. You got to put it
[1:27:41] in action.
[1:27:44] It's fine to say, "Amen. It's good."
[1:27:48] It's fine to say, "I believe that's
[1:27:50] true." But then put it in action. You
[1:27:54] got to put it in action.
[1:27:56] Amen.
[1:27:58] So, Revelation 12 then gives us a a much
[1:28:01] needed clue to understanding at least at
[1:28:06] least a fold of what we're reading in
[1:28:09] Genesis 4
[1:28:12] where Cain slew his brother where Abel
[1:28:15] obeyed the word of God and it cost him.
[1:28:17] See, so Revelation 12 then at the end of
[1:28:21] the Bible, halfway through the book,
[1:28:23] halfway through the chapter is giving us
[1:28:26] a clue and giving and and some
[1:28:29] information about what we can read
[1:28:30] between the lines in Genesis 4. And that
[1:28:35] is to say, don't let it go unnoticed.
[1:28:37] Let me say it like that. I I I wouldn't
[1:28:39] want you to leave here today and it be
[1:28:42] unnoticed that this prophetic insight
[1:28:45] into history into the history of
[1:28:47] creation
[1:28:49] cuz that's what our text was.
[1:28:51] Yeah.
[1:28:51] We're in we're in we're in day one.
[1:28:54] We're in the opening scenes of man in a
[1:28:57] fallen condition. See? And so don't let
[1:29:00] it be lost on you that the history o of
[1:29:04] creation, you know, that finally we're
[1:29:06] going to see in Revelation 12, it's
[1:29:09] going to show us that victory certainly
[1:29:13] uh the best ones come through anguish,
[1:29:16] they come through tribulation, and they
[1:29:19] come through overcoming. Amen.
[1:29:21] Interestingly enough, this what I would
[1:29:23] call a vital clue is not described
[1:29:27] uh so poignantly as we find between
[1:29:31] Genesis 4 and Revelation 12. And it
[1:29:35] gives support for why actually it gives
[1:29:39] support for why the book of Revelation
[1:29:41] is rightly thought of as the bride's
[1:29:43] book at the end time.
[1:29:45] Because it's at the end time that we've
[1:29:47] got to be the overcomers.
[1:29:49] Amen. that of every age that fell, we're
[1:29:52] predestinated not to.
[1:29:54] See, praise God.
[1:29:56] So, we're got to overcome. Overcome
[1:29:58] what? Overcome anything that's contrary
[1:30:01] to God's word living itself through your
[1:30:05] life.
[1:30:07] Anything. What do I got to overcome?
[1:30:08] Overcome anything that's contrary to the
[1:30:12] word living through your life. Amen.
[1:30:16] See, and and and I and I will say this,
[1:30:20] and I'm going to have to uh start moving
[1:30:22] to a to a pause point.
[1:30:28] This will be accomplished
[1:30:32] because of Hebrews 13:8.
[1:30:35] Because that Christ is willing to be the
[1:30:38] living word in you.
[1:30:42] So that it ain't something you got to
[1:30:44] accomplish.
[1:30:45] All right?
[1:30:47] That chiefly we will be overcomers
[1:30:51] by not falling for the lie of the end
[1:30:57] time.
[1:30:57] Amen.
[1:30:59] The Bible speaks of a perilous time
[1:31:02] coming.
[1:31:04] And the Bible speaks of people who will
[1:31:08] decide as the ancient people did that
[1:31:12] they don't want God's word directing
[1:31:14] their lives.
[1:31:16] And so they they turn his word into
[1:31:22] for-footed creatures and winged
[1:31:24] creatures and reptiles and birds and
[1:31:27] they worship the creation more than the
[1:31:30] creator.
[1:31:31] Amen. So because they don't want Christ
[1:31:33] ruling over them, they turn God into an
[1:31:36] idol called denominational names and
[1:31:39] they're names of blasphemy.
[1:31:43] And because that the ancient people did
[1:31:46] that and the last day people do that, he
[1:31:49] says because you did that, I will go
[1:31:52] ahead and just let you go there and I
[1:31:55] will let the devil take you down the
[1:31:57] primrose path. You're going to find out
[1:31:59] that it's destruction at the end, but
[1:32:01] I'm going to actually give you a spirit
[1:32:04] of delusion because you didn't want my
[1:32:06] word. Fine. Okay. Then I'll give you a
[1:32:09] spirit of delusion so that you will
[1:32:11] inescapably believe a lie and be damned
[1:32:14] by it.
[1:32:15] Amen.
[1:32:15] And brother Brandham taught us that even
[1:32:17] in the Greek it bears it out that that
[1:32:19] lie is the lie, not just a lie, but the
[1:32:22] original lie told in the Garden of Eden.
[1:32:25] And the lie told in the Garden of Eden
[1:32:28] was this. That you don't have to believe
[1:32:31] every word of God. The word of God can
[1:32:34] be compromised.
[1:32:36] And that broke the world.
[1:32:40] That's the original lie of the Garden of
[1:32:43] Eden is that the word of God can be
[1:32:46] compromised and it'll be okay. It won't
[1:32:50] be okay.
[1:32:52] And so the whole world at the end time
[1:32:56] goes insane, a neurotic age.
[1:32:59] And it's not that God is going to
[1:33:02] destroy mankind. The Bible will show us
[1:33:06] in prophecy that what he's going to do
[1:33:08] is remove the rest restraining peace.
[1:33:11] And that's you.
[1:33:13] Amen. that he that letth, that's Christ,
[1:33:15] will let he'll let the enemy do what he
[1:33:18] wants until he Christ in the bride in a
[1:33:20] rapture be taken out of the way.
[1:33:23] And then and it's just God's going to
[1:33:25] pull the chucks out from under the wheel
[1:33:26] and let the wagon roll off the cliff.
[1:33:29] Amen.
[1:33:30] It will be man destroying himself.
[1:33:35] Man will be the foster parent of his own
[1:33:38] extinction event.
[1:33:40] Amen.
[1:33:43] So to overcome,
[1:33:47] we accomplish our overcoming chiefly by
[1:33:50] not falling for the deception of the
[1:33:53] last days.
[1:33:55] And it has many forms and many faces.
[1:33:57] We've preached on it before. The most
[1:33:59] prevalent one is that, you know, we're
[1:34:02] all Christians and we're all going to
[1:34:03] heaven. That's completely contrary to
[1:34:05] scripture.
[1:34:07] And I get that people are can be
[1:34:08] Christians because the brother Brandham
[1:34:10] said they admire the fine qualities of
[1:34:12] Jesus. They love the Nazarene and they
[1:34:15] they actually do believe he was the son
[1:34:16] of God and they actually believe it for
[1:34:18] real and that he died to save them and
[1:34:20] that's for that's true. But they but
[1:34:23] then they they say I love him but then
[1:34:25] they don't love this when it tells them
[1:34:27] how to live and how they should do and
[1:34:28] what they shouldn't do and and oh no I I
[1:34:31] just want Jesus. Well here he is.
[1:34:34] No, but I want the one 2,000 years ago.
[1:34:36] He can't do you any good.
[1:34:38] He rose from the dead. Brother Brandham
[1:34:40] said on that glorious morning, he rose,
[1:34:41] but what good does that do you?
[1:34:44] How did brother said, how does that help
[1:34:45] me? But Jesus said, because I live, you
[1:34:48] can live also.
[1:34:50] So, so he that liveth and believeth in
[1:34:53] me shall never die. See,
[1:34:55] so you've got to accept the Christ of
[1:34:58] today in his word.
[1:35:01] Your claim that you love Jesus without
[1:35:04] following his word is illegitimate.
[1:35:06] You are a fornicator
[1:35:08] of God's word doing that. And that's why
[1:35:11] your life demonstrates the way it does.
[1:35:15] I'm preaching prophecy, friends. I can't
[1:35:17] pull punches.
[1:35:19] We got to make this uh razor's edge.
[1:35:23] So, how do we overcome, brother Jason?
[1:35:25] Because none of us are perfect. And I
[1:35:26] think I probably fell 78 times
[1:35:28] yesterday. Well, get in line. And I
[1:35:30] probably fell 79 times yesterday.
[1:35:32] Come on.
[1:35:33] But it's accomplished chiefly by
[1:35:36] whatever you do. Whatever you do,
[1:35:39] don't fall for the lie.
[1:35:41] Amen.
[1:35:42] Don't fall for the deception
[1:35:44] that you can compromise God's word at
[1:35:46] all.
[1:35:48] Even one three-letter word broke the
[1:35:51] world.
[1:35:54] So
[1:35:55] we find that
[1:35:58] that we we we chiefly overcome by not
[1:36:02] falling for the deception of the last
[1:36:03] days. And let let me uh brother Caleb,
[1:36:07] before I close, let's look at Revelation
[1:36:09] chapter 2
[1:36:11] verses 18 to 28. You good?
[1:36:15] I'm g I'm gonna wrap it up here in about
[1:36:17] five or 10 minutes. Going to hit the
[1:36:19] brakes. As brother Jules said, we're
[1:36:21] gonna, you know, jump out, pull the
[1:36:23] parachute, and uh but that's a little
[1:36:27] bit slow. I'll fly it to the ground and
[1:36:28] we'll land at 200 miles an hour. Okay.
[1:36:32] Brother Eddie did that in his pilot
[1:36:34] training on his first on his check ride
[1:36:36] when he's got an instructor and and he
[1:36:39] and dad said he landed it in there and
[1:36:41] you know, got it to a stop and and he
[1:36:44] looked to the instructor, "Well, how'd I
[1:36:45] do?" He said, "Well, Ed, you did pretty
[1:36:46] good, but you're not supposed to land at
[1:36:48] 140 miles an hour.
[1:36:50] You're supposed to float it down and let
[1:36:52] it touch down."
[1:36:54] Amen. But well, hey, flying is just
[1:36:57] aiming at the earth and missing, right?
[1:37:00] I heard a fighter pilot say that. Flying
[1:37:02] is easy. It's just aiming at the earth
[1:37:04] and miss.
[1:37:07] Revelation 2:18-28.
[1:37:10] Now, hey, before you read, let me let me
[1:37:12] tell you why we're reading Thotyra.
[1:37:14] Thotira Because Thoterra repeats at the
[1:37:17] end time. It has parallels to mine in
[1:37:19] your day.
[1:37:20] See, uh, and and and you you you'll see
[1:37:24] that as we as we read, and I'll I'll try
[1:37:26] to point it out to you as we go so you
[1:37:28] don't get lost in the shuffle.
[1:37:31] And unto the angel of the church in
[1:37:33] Thotira, write these things,
[1:37:36] saith the son of God, who hath his eyes
[1:37:39] like unto a flame of fire, and his feet
[1:37:42] like fine brass. Now, hold right there.
[1:37:44] Hold. Go back. Hold right there. So, let
[1:37:46] me let me just say let me just give you
[1:37:48] some quick pointers so you won't you
[1:37:50] won't spend time trying to figure it out
[1:37:52] and you won't hear what I'm saying. So,
[1:37:55] Thotira was known for,
[1:37:58] you know, they they they started
[1:38:00] remember Ephesus was relaxed and you
[1:38:03] remember then Smyrna starts talking
[1:38:04] about death. You remember in the third
[1:38:06] age they're going to crown a false
[1:38:07] prophet with a triple crown and then by
[1:38:09] the fourth age they've got a false
[1:38:11] prophet seated on the throne and it's a
[1:38:13] Jezebel the seat see it's a Jezebel
[1:38:16] religion remember that see
[1:38:19] now so that means the church has went
[1:38:21] into complete darkness
[1:38:23] it's just before Luther's going to break
[1:38:25] out with a little bit of light that and
[1:38:27] and that commences the thousand years of
[1:38:30] what they call the dark ages
[1:38:33] until Luther
[1:38:35] springs with the light and goes back and
[1:38:36] picks up an Old Testament prophet. The
[1:38:38] just shall live by his faith. Luther
[1:38:40] caught a revelation out of the Old
[1:38:41] Testament. See? So, so, so now you've
[1:38:45] got a Jezebel system, a false prophet on
[1:38:48] a throne. It's a Jezebel religion. It's
[1:38:51] brought total darkness to the world.
[1:38:53] Sound familiar?
[1:38:54] Yes. Amen.
[1:38:55] See, so that repeats at the end time.
[1:38:58] The fourth age got there by a by the
[1:39:01] degradation of ages one, two, and three.
[1:39:04] And then by the fourth, it's dark ages.
[1:39:06] And then there's a restoration uh coming
[1:39:09] under Luther Wesley and moving it and
[1:39:11] moving into the and moving into the
[1:39:13] return of the token with a with a third
[1:39:17] stage in there that a lot of people
[1:39:18] didn't notice of the shuck because
[1:39:22] people say, "Wait, I thought it's three
[1:39:23] works of grace." It is, but it's four
[1:39:25] stages of restoration. Can't get that
[1:39:27] confused. See? So, so we'll we'll get
[1:39:30] that when we start teaching on it. But I
[1:39:32] I just want to I just want to keep you
[1:39:34] on the same page with me because what
[1:39:35] we're talking about, remember, how do I
[1:39:37] overcome? What's the best way? How can I
[1:39:40] be an overcomer? Better yet, here's a
[1:39:42] better question because you might tell
[1:39:43] me how to do it and I might can't pull
[1:39:44] it off. How can I be viewed as an
[1:39:47] overcomer?
[1:39:48] How can I get the Lord to view me as an
[1:39:51] overcomer
[1:39:52] whether I fell 79 times yesterday or
[1:39:54] not?
[1:39:56] Amen. he would still today view me as an
[1:39:58] overcomer.
[1:39:59] Amen.
[1:40:02] Verse 18. And unto the angel of the
[1:40:04] church in Thite, write these things,
[1:40:05] sayeth the son of God, who hath his eyes
[1:40:07] like a flame of fire, and his feet uh
[1:40:10] are like fine brass. I know thy works in
[1:40:13] charity and service, and faith, and thy
[1:40:14] patience, and thy works. See, they're
[1:40:17] they're all about works at this point.
[1:40:19] It's works, works, works.
[1:40:22] They've got service and faith and
[1:40:23] patience, and thy works. and and um and
[1:40:27] the last to be more than the first. And
[1:40:29] notwithstanding, I have a few things
[1:40:30] against thee. Here it comes. Now, look
[1:40:32] at the parallel to our age. Because thou
[1:40:34] suffest that woman Jezebel, which
[1:40:36] calleth herself a prophetist, to teach
[1:40:38] and seduce my servants, to commit
[1:40:39] fornication,
[1:40:41] brother Brandham said, spiritual
[1:40:43] adultery against Christ the word, as
[1:40:45] calling him your husband.
[1:40:46] Yeah.
[1:40:47] Calling yourself the bride when you're
[1:40:48] an adulterous woman to his word. See,
[1:40:52] and so you you can see why they hated
[1:40:55] brother Brandham. That same reason Cain
[1:40:57] hated Abel. Cain hated Abel.
[1:41:00] The same reason Satan hated Jesus. See?
[1:41:04] So, so he says to teach and seduce my
[1:41:07] servants to commit fornication and to
[1:41:09] eat things sacrificed to idols. And I
[1:41:12] gave her a space to repent of her
[1:41:13] fornication. He sent he sent her the
[1:41:15] word, sent her a message, sent her a
[1:41:17] messenger in that age. He sent a
[1:41:18] messenger in this age. Finally, he had
[1:41:20] to indict the whole age. You've
[1:41:22] crucified the Lord. It's already done.
[1:41:24] You can't take it back. In the presence
[1:41:26] of the judge, I indict you. See,
[1:41:29] behold, I will cast her into a bed, and
[1:41:32] them that commit adultery with her into
[1:41:33] a great tribulation, except they repent
[1:41:35] of their deeds. And I will kill her
[1:41:37] children with death. See, no one even
[1:41:39] knew she was going to have children.
[1:41:40] Luther was a thousand years away.
[1:41:43] Luther hadn't started the Reformation.
[1:41:46] that and that and that which turned into
[1:41:47] a denomination which turned into three
[1:41:49] really quickly which turned into 10
[1:41:51] really quickly which then burggeoned on
[1:41:53] and and by the time you get to today
[1:41:55] we're at 40,000.
[1:41:57] All right.
[1:41:58] And I will kill her children with death
[1:42:01] and all the churches shall know that I
[1:42:03] am he which search searchth the rain.
[1:42:06] See all the churches are going to know
[1:42:08] and this is only the fourth age. 56 and
[1:42:11] seven ain't even on the scene yet but
[1:42:12] all the churches are going to know and
[1:42:13] he's telling about it in Thotira. Amen.
[1:42:15] See, but there's got to be a time when
[1:42:18] it comes when the bride leaves and all
[1:42:21] the churches are going to know.
[1:42:24] Watch. Look. All the churches shall know
[1:42:27] that I am he which searchth the reigns
[1:42:29] and hearts. And I will give unto every
[1:42:32] one of you according to your works. But
[1:42:34] but unto you I say, and unto the rest in
[1:42:37] Thotira, as many as have not this
[1:42:39] doctrine. In other words, you haven't
[1:42:41] fallen for that black system. and which
[1:42:43] have not known the depths of Satan.
[1:42:45] You've stayed true to all you know as
[1:42:48] they speak. I will put upon you none
[1:42:52] other burden but that which you already
[1:42:55] have. Hold fast till I come. And he goes
[1:42:58] on down. He that overcomemeth and
[1:42:59] keepeth um my my works and to the end to
[1:43:02] him will I give power over the nations
[1:43:05] and he shall rule them with a rod of
[1:43:07] iron as the vessels of a pottery goes on
[1:43:09] down. vessels of a potter uh shall they
[1:43:11] be broken to shivers even as I received
[1:43:14] of my father. Verse 28, and I will give
[1:43:17] him the morning star. Now, the ministry
[1:43:20] of the morning star is the ministry of
[1:43:23] the message of the hour that we have
[1:43:25] today. It's Christ. He's the morning
[1:43:26] star.
[1:43:27] You know, you're supposed to carry on
[1:43:29] until the day dawn and the day star rise
[1:43:32] in your hearts. See, so they had that
[1:43:35] they had that uh rising sun ministry in
[1:43:38] Paul's day. Paul, that's what Paul was
[1:43:40] preaching from. That whole first church
[1:43:43] was the ministry of the son of man. The
[1:43:45] word was made flesh. But they fell away
[1:43:47] from it. And then they went off into
[1:43:49] denomination. And Christ instead of
[1:43:51] coming to get a bride, he must sit down
[1:43:53] in the eternities, seal up the word in
[1:43:55] seven seals, intercede upon their
[1:43:58] ignorance of his people so he doesn't
[1:43:59] lose any of his children though they
[1:44:01] believe false teaching. Amen.
[1:44:03] And so now we come to a parallel of our
[1:44:07] last day and he's saying to you here
[1:44:10] today, I will put nothing more upon you
[1:44:14] than to not be deceived by the
[1:44:16] prevailing spirit of fornication against
[1:44:19] God's word. And if you'll just do that,
[1:44:22] if you'll just say amen to every word,
[1:44:25] you might have 79 failures yesterday,
[1:44:27] but you woke up today saying, "Father,
[1:44:29] forgive me. Amen to every word. I'll put
[1:44:33] no other burden upon you.
[1:44:35] Amen.
[1:44:36] Than that which you already have. We've
[1:44:38] already got a dark world. It's already
[1:44:41] terrible and and and the lid is torn
[1:44:43] from hell and demon powers are streaming
[1:44:45] and it's totally black. But I'll put no
[1:44:47] other burden upon you other than that
[1:44:50] you're willing to hear and to recognize
[1:44:52] and to act upon my word
[1:44:55] because that'll demonstrate your faith.
[1:44:57] And if you'll just do that, that's all
[1:44:59] you'll need to do.
[1:45:03] I'll do the rest. And and Jesus is
[1:45:05] saying to you today, you know, you'll
[1:45:08] you you'll be an overcomer.
[1:45:10] Amen.
[1:45:11] And you'll know it's me because you'll
[1:45:13] know that to overcome everything in this
[1:45:15] world is quite impossible. So you'll
[1:45:17] know it's me when you find yourself
[1:45:18] doing it.
[1:45:20] Hallelujah. Let's stand to our feet,
[1:45:21] friends. Praise the Lord. My goodness. I
[1:45:24] didn't even get as far as I thought I
[1:45:26] would get today. I didn't think I'd get
[1:45:28] very far, but I but I wanted to
[1:45:33] I wanted to
[1:45:35] lay these foundation stones
[1:45:39] uh to building our understanding
[1:45:42] of modern events again made clear in
[1:45:47] prophecy. when you go to hear brother
[1:45:50] Brandon preach that, you know, it's like
[1:45:53] when when the LLMs first came out and
[1:45:56] this chat or this chat and they were
[1:45:58] limited and they said, "My knowledge
[1:45:59] only goes to this certain date." And
[1:46:00] you're like, "Well, what about
[1:46:01] afterwards?" Well, sorry, I don't have
[1:46:02] any knowledge of that. Well, you're not
[1:46:04] you're useless then if I don't because
[1:46:06] knowledge changes like that. I need
[1:46:08] cutting edge. And so they caught that.
[1:46:10] Now they're all now they allow now they
[1:46:12] allow it to search for the for the
[1:46:13] latest greatest information. And so so
[1:46:16] brother Brandham he was only able to go
[1:46:18] to the history he had lived. Thank God
[1:46:21] he was a prophet so that he could
[1:46:23] project what we would come to today.
[1:46:26] Said well he never mentioned the
[1:46:27] internet. He never mentioned social
[1:46:28] media and he never mentioned these
[1:46:30] things but he mentioned a plenty so that
[1:46:32] when we arrive here we still know how to
[1:46:35] be overcomers.
[1:46:37] Amen.
[1:46:37] Amen.
[1:46:38] Do you believe he's made us overcomers
[1:46:40] today?
[1:46:41] Amen. Um I got a song in my mind.
[1:46:44] Anthony, you may have one, but we've
[1:46:45] been made more than conquerors,
[1:46:48] overcomers in this life. Amen. Let's see
[1:46:50] if we can find some words for that,
[1:46:52] brother Caleb. Amen.
[1:46:55] That's it. More than coner.
[1:46:59] [Music]
[1:47:02] Oh, overcomers
[1:47:05] in this life. Is
[1:47:06] that the right key? Okay, keep going.
[1:47:10] Oh, we've been
[1:47:14] victori
[1:47:20] through the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:47:25] Oh, we've been made. Oh, we've been made
[1:47:30] more than conquers.
[1:47:35] Oh, yes. overcomes
[1:47:38] in this life.
[1:47:42] Hallelujah. Raise your hands now.
[1:47:45] We've been made
[1:47:47] victorious.
[1:47:50] He deserves it
[1:47:53] through the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:47:56] Again, again, now it's a prayer,
[1:48:00] a prayer of thanksgiving.
[1:48:01] We've been made. We remain overcome over
[1:48:06] [Music]
[1:48:10] overcomers
[1:48:12] in this life.
[1:48:14] Oh yes. Thank God for that.
[1:48:18] We've been made
[1:48:20] victorious.
[1:48:26] Oh, through the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:48:31] We got a any verses today
[1:48:36] verses. When truth,
[1:48:39] [Music]
[1:48:46] don't be afraid.
[1:48:49] You know it's not like before.
[1:48:52] Don't give in.
[1:48:55] Don't you give in. Don't let it break.
[1:49:01] Oh my
[1:49:03] to wor.
[1:49:05] [Music]
[1:49:09] Oh, we've been made more than coner.
[1:49:16] Thank God
[1:49:19] overcomeers
[1:49:21] in this life.
[1:49:23] Hallelujah. Yes, Lord. Oh, we've been
[1:49:27] made
[1:49:29] victorious
[1:49:34] through the blood of Jesus. One more
[1:49:37] time.
[1:49:40] Sing it like you believe it now. We've
[1:49:43] been made
[1:49:46] coner.
[1:49:50] Let me hear you.
[1:49:51] Overcomes
[1:49:53] in this. Oh, what a sweet melody.
[1:49:58] Oh, we've been made
[1:50:01] victorious
[1:50:07] through the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:50:11] If
[1:50:12] Tony wants to change it, he can. Let's
[1:50:13] Let's bow our heads. Master,
[1:50:17] we've been made conquerors, more than
[1:50:19] conquerors. We thank you for that. I
[1:50:22] thank you for your word today. Yeah. I
[1:50:24] thank you for these people, Lord, who
[1:50:26] sat patiently as we went through these
[1:50:29] things carefully, piece by piece,
[1:50:32] picking up this piece and that piece,
[1:50:34] turning it over, looking at it good,
[1:50:36] digesting its rel it its relative
[1:50:38] meaning to us in the moment. There's
[1:50:40] much more to be said, Lord, about every
[1:50:43] point we made today. More can be said,
[1:50:45] and we will we'll get to it. I feel a
[1:50:48] very satisfying feeling in my heart
[1:50:50] today, Lord. I believe your word went
[1:50:52] forth. I believe the people have seen
[1:50:54] things clearly. If if Leodysa had uh
[1:50:59] Lord, if the fog of war had kind of, you
[1:51:02] know, made things difficult to see,
[1:51:03] maybe they can see a little more clearly
[1:51:05] today. See all the moving parts and a
[1:51:08] prophet told us all these things at the
[1:51:09] end time. And this is a major key.
[1:51:12] They're all happening in a cluster.
[1:51:15] They're all happening simultaneously.
[1:51:17] It's all choreographed. It's all
[1:51:19] synchronized. It's it's like a it's like
[1:51:22] a a a piece of music, like a ballet,
[1:51:25] like a like a a wonderful choreographed
[1:51:28] scene unfolding. And we want to see our
[1:51:31] part in it. We want to hear the rhythm
[1:51:33] and the timing. We want to make sure
[1:51:35] we're paying attention to the conductor
[1:51:37] and the leader. Lord, may you help us
[1:51:40] today now, as we go forth today, giving
[1:51:42] the people quite a bit to think about.
[1:51:43] And I pray they will do just that and
[1:51:46] think about it. We commit it to you now
[1:51:48] in Jesus name. Amen. As brother Tony
[1:51:51] sings, you can be dismissed in Jesus
[1:51:53] name. God bless you. So happy to have
[1:51:55] you here.
[1:51:56] More of you.
[1:52:03] More of you.
[1:52:10] I've had it all.
[1:52:14] But what I need
[1:52:17] is more of you.
[1:52:22] [Music]
[1:52:24] Of things I've had, my fear,
[1:52:31] but yet I hunger
[1:52:35] still.
[1:52:37] [Music]
[1:52:39] Empty and bare.
[1:52:43] Lord, hear my prayer.
[1:52:46] More of you.
[1:52:53] More of you.
[1:52:57] [Music]
[1:53:00] More of you.
[1:53:07] I've had it all.
[1:53:10] [Applause]
[1:53:11] But what I need is more of you.
[1:53:18] [Music]
[1:53:20] Of things I've had in my field,
[1:53:26] but yet
[1:53:28] I hunger still.
[1:53:34] Empty and bare.
[1:53:37] Lord, hear my prayer.
[1:53:40] for more of you.
[1:53:45] [Music]
[1:53:47] More of you.
[1:53:51] [Music]
[1:53:54] More of you.
[1:53:58] [Music]
[1:54:01] I've had it all.
[1:54:04] But what I need is more of you.
[1:54:14] Of things I've had my feel,
[1:54:20] but yet
[1:54:22] I hunger
[1:54:24] still
[1:54:27] empty and bare.
[1:54:31] Lord, hear my prayer for more of you.
[1:54:40] More of you.
[1:54:43] [Music]
[1:54:46] More of you.
[1:54:50] [Music]
[1:54:54] I've had it all.
[1:54:56] [Music]
