spent the night in sleeplessness and Rose at every sound half in helpless sorrow and half in fear the day would find the solders breaking through to drag us all [Music] away well just before the sunrise I heard something at the wall the gate began to rattle and the voice began to call I hurried to the window and looked down into the streets expecting swords and torches and the sound of soldiers [Music] feet there was no one there but Mary so I went down to let her in John stood there beside me she told us where she'd been she said they moved him in the night none of us knows where the stones been rolled away and now his body isn't [Laughter] there we both ran toward the garden John ran on aead we found the stone and the empty tomb just the way that fa said but the winding sheets they wrapped him in was just an empty shell how and where they taken him was more than I could [Music] tell well something strange had happened there just what I did not know John believed a miracle but I just turned to go circumstance and speculation couldn't lift me very high cuz it seen them crucify him then I saw him die [Music] well back inside the house again the guilt and anguish came everything i' promised him just added to my shame when at last it came to choices I denied I knew his name and even if he was alive it wouldn't be the [Music] same well suddenly the air was filled with a strange and sweet perfume a light that Shone from everywhere drove Shadows from the room Jesus stood before me with his arms held open wide and I fell down on on my knees and just clung to him and cried he raised me to my feet as I looked in his eyes love was shining out from him like sunlight from the skies guilt and my confusion disappeared in sweet release and every fear I'd ever had just melted into peace he's alive he's alive he's alive and I'm forgiven Heaven's gates are open wide he's alive he's alive he's alive and I'm forgiven Heaven's gates are open wide he's alive he's alive he's alive and I'm forgiven Heaven's gates are open wide he's alive he's alive he's alive he is alive [Music] [Applause] amen sister Sarah if you come and give us a song this morning let's give

been wash clean and if I run no I'm running from a p that's been redeemed to a world it might look crazy but there's just no telling what you're going to do in that moment Jesus gets a hold of you

important amen I love him I love his word we greet you in the name of the Lord today happy to have you in the house of God a beautiful sunny Sunday morning praise the Lord amen amen praise God Amen um praise the Lord I'm going to invite you right into the scripture I got a prayer request we're going to pray over here just in a moment butth if you'll go ahead and find your place in First Corinthians the 5th chapter amen praise the Lord we're gonna take a reading brother Gant good to have you here today God bless you my brother let me read this request a very important prayer request this came from Brother Bradley Campbell uh my cousin Andrew CA I think it was brother Bradley texted me last night let me know he has cancer now he's a cousin but he's very close to brother Bradley almost more like a brother says he let me know he has cancer has two lesions found on his brain and four tumors in his lungs told him I would be fasting and praying please please pray for him he is um I think I thought I'd read somewhere that seventh day I believe seventh day praise the Lord so we're going to have faith amen that not only the Lord will give him a revelation of Divine Healing amen but show him what's behind that there's more than just healing amen from the tree of life amen God bless you we'll catch that when we pray let's read our text this morning 1 Corinthians 5 we're trusting by the will of the Lord to carry on today in the voice in the East Wind this will be the third installment amen 1 Corinthians 5 and we'll catch verses 1 through 8 it is reported commonly that there is fornication among you and such fornication as is not so much as is named among the Gentiles that one should have his father's wife and ye are puffed up and have not rather mourned that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you for I verily as absent in body but present in spirit have judged already as though I were present concerning him that hath done th so done this deed in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ when you are gathered together and my spirit with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ to to deliver such a one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus your glorying is not good know you not that A little leaven lenth the whole lump Purge out therefore the old leaven that you may be a new lump as as ye are unleavened for even Christ Our let us keep the feast not with old leaven neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and Truth amen we'll comment just in a moment let's pray father we come before for you this morning Lord and our hearts are just the heart of a Seeker this morning seeking your will seeking your perfect will Lord and how to go forward you see the thought that's in my heart and Lord the struggles of my mind about how it should best be presented I commit myself into your hands as I did in the early morning hours Lord I'm standing here committed to you and ask Lord in this import important time in this darkening world with Lord trouble on every hand we must see you clearly we must we must see your movements Lord we must know the time that we stand and the challenges that are we're facing father I commit this now into your hands I have centered in uh my whole thinking and my mind and my heart to your service now and I pray you will bring forth the Word of Life To Us Lord there's a great request father placed before the Believers today concerning this man Lord who has discovered cancer and Lord he reaches out to someone to a cousin to a friend to someone like a brother who he knows knows God lord I pray that you'll reward that faith that he has to reach out Lord to brother Bradley and be assured through our dear brother that this whole assembly will take him up in prayer Lord we ask for your Mercy today Father we commit it now as brother Bradley and I stood together in the back praying we sending forth the Holy Spirit Lord May the enemy be rebuked and repulsed we commit it to you in Jesus name amen God bless you friends you can be seated praise the Lord I want to move into areas today that the Lord has opened up to me in this series we're also going to as is my way um periodically drop back and make points that we've already made but points that I have Whitted down to the to the essence of this series points that I think that are vital I wouldn't repeat them if I didn't think they were vital uh but we know that a lot of times not everyone hears every sermon all at the same time and so there may be someone hearing today some of these things for the first time so if you're hearing them for the second or third time just be patient because the lord has laid it on my heart to repeat a few of the statements that I've made before as we at the same time simultaneously are going forward in our thought we took this idea of the voice in the East Wind uh and it's familiar to you by now because we have found that generally speaking the East Wind in the Bible is a negative thing we find that the East wind's role as a very it is and as such it is a powerful metaphor in the biblical narrative it's it's a lot of imagery and uh it we have found in our study that it represents three distinct things it represents more than three but three of the main thoughts of the East Wind and that is it generally represents divine intervention it's or it might represent Divine judgment or it might represent the futility of human Endeavors and human Endeavors are not futile unless they're moving in a direction contrary to God's blueprint for our lives you should really go by the instruction manual the the person who wrote this built you and knows everything about you and has a plan and a pathway forward for you so we find that a lot of times people choose the wrong direction and God sends an East Wind sometimes it's intervention in Mercy sometimes it's judgment sometimes it's to uh arrest you from going in a wrong direction regardless of what it is I am of a mind today to say thank you Lord for however you had to bring it in my life by whatever means that you have found necessary to keep me going forward according to your vision I just say praise God I don't say I always enjoyed it I don't say it was always something good the people think that all things uh are good to them that love the Lord that's not what the Bible teaches us the Bible doesn't teach that all things are good that happen to you it teaches that God will make them all work together for your good and so so we realize then that that we took a text in part one of pharaoh and how that he came up upon the eighth plague and he had already heard the word of the Lord in the previous seven plagues that had hit flawlessly exactly what Moses said would happen happen and so when he when he still refused then the Lord sent an East Wind and the Bible says and it blew all night and in the next morning the East Wind in the East Wind came the Locust and we took this thought that we've said several times how is it that Pharaoh didn't hear the voice in the East Wind you'd think that after seven times he would have got it uh but then sometimes I wonder in my own life and in our own lives do we always hear his voice we go about our life and we go about a path and we we think we know what's best for our life and the Lord starts warning us and starts warning us and starts warning us and sometimes you know we we have moments of clarity and sincerity and we we repent we say Lord help me to get back on your path uh because we we find that God has a perfect path sometimes that you will get in his permissive will and he will allow it but I'm here to tell you that that never ends well don't don't use that like a pass and say well maybe I'll just take his permissive will that never ends well because the whole thing is that God will allow that to happen for a season and you go off of his path don't don't think that he'll just sit back and watch he'll actually keep guiding you and he'll keep bending you and bending you and bending you and every time he bends and changes the angle it hurts until he gets you back on his straight and narrow path listen if you're a child of God then he has an exact path he's never going to lose you and he will have to do say what might he have to do to get me uh to Glory where he has foresaw me from the foundation of the world well I just would say let him have his way because if you let him have his way it'll be good and if you don't let him have his way it'll be bad and he'll have his way anyway for that I'm also thankful for that I'm also grateful because sometimes I've persisted after one whipping two whippings three whippings four whippings sometimes a child just keeps going determined to do it their way until finally something happens to where they are they either are so broken or their life is broken that they can't keep going forward and I don't want to see that happen to me I don't want to see it happen to you this is why we preach this is why this is the house of correction this is why judgment begins at the house of the Lord I was I was watching a few clips and I'm not I don't mean to disparage I don't mean to come across that way uh you know it's just a lack of understanding but I I watched a few Clips I came across them uh where they were you you they're I guess they're called shorts or whatever where preachers and these were these were nominal preachers uh that have these little brief clips of their Ministry and I I thought to myself oh wonderful let me just let me just give this a fair hearing and it wasn't that I heard anything wrong I just heard a bunch of uselessness and I went to a second one I said okay may that just must be a one-off and I listened to a second one and I didn't hear anything wrong but I didn't hear anything of value and I went to a third one I thought three is a charm surely and it's a totally different organiz ation now three nobody's going to strike out three times in a row wouldn't you imagine again I didn't hear anything horrible detestable or wrong but I didn't hear anything that told me the age I'm living in the world condition that I'm facing how do I navigate it how do I get home how do I get clean all I heard was psychological theory about how we can be a better person and and how we can fight the the the the the battle of the mind a little more clearly I I have the uh War book I have one a battle one1 I have God's answer I can see how he did it in the lives of his family and so I know that if I believe God in this age like my brothers and sisters believed him in previous ages he being the same yesterday and forever will always act and do and respond the same way for me as he did for them sir and I take great comfort in that you're guaranteed friends to hear things that you're not going to hear in the average Sunday morning pull pit I don't say that to disparage I just simply say we need to do a better job of getting the truth out so so we find then that that there is this idea we found another instance as far as I'm rehearsing we found that there is the the whole thing of filling your mouth with the East Wind or we really emphasize more filling your life with the East Wind when you're filling your mouth with East when you're basically filling your mouth and your thoughts with words that sound great like what I heard but serve no purpose they're just Bluster and it's just it just has no real tangible usable strength-giving lifegiving sin killing effect and if you're hearing a word that isn't sin killing you're wasting your time because we're we're we not only are we born in sin but we born into a sinful world and this is serious you know the the the scripture that warns of the end time and we see it happening around us and even right now you know I I looked at a headline just before leaving the home and I thought let me just find one headline that sums up yesterday or last night's events with Israel being attacked on upon their Sovereign Nation from within another Sovereign Nation it should be an act of War it's one thing to attack from proxies and other nations but when you when one boundary Nation launches a direct attack on another boundary Nation I don't know why the knesset why Netanyahu hasn't already issued a declaration of war that's what we did that's right when we were attacked by the Empire of Japan in 1941 our president went to Congress to ask for a declaration of war and it was granted so you say do you want War I want Heaven I want whatever it takes to get me gone I want to I want King Jesus to come back and take over this world it's br broken there's no fixing it not preaching a message of hopelessness today quite the contrary I'm telling you we're the only place that there is hope and that is in the revealed word of the hour you'll see why even more clearly as we go yes so you know when you have a a life Pursuit that has no you say well wait a minute I you know my schooling has a purpose uh this career has a purpose you know I have a purpose in having these certain friends I have a purpose in going in this certain direction what are you talking about preacher purposelessness okay can can I can I amend my statement when your life has no Eternal purpose why is that important because everything outside of that is going to go to Ash and Cinder so whatever you're chasing is going in Flames anyhow so I just say whatever has an eternal purpose that's going to be my purpose and if you're not filling your life with eternal purpose that can survive then your then your purpose is just the purpose of the East Wind we've shown you how that people don't realize the futility of filling themselves with the East Wind and we made this point last time and I'm just going to hit it quickly and move on because I think it's again it's a vital point A lot of times we don't realize uh the futility of doing that because simply s speaking our lives are just too short and we don't really get a good perspective of things till you're already old and about to die and then you you you get like Solomon you get Melancholy and you look back on your life and you regret all kinds of things and I wish I'd have did it different th this is the great um weakness of Youth that that you that youth have such a hard time seeing there's things that that I can say to young people now and I know what I'm talking about cuz I was them then and now I'm now and I can see and I had other friends that I can see now who were like them then so I'm speaking from experience I can say don't chase the East Wind whatever you do young people don't do that you're going to regret that when you're older you you don't it's and and and the sad part about regret now sometimes things happen beyond our control that are regrettable but the one that just is sand in my teeth and will be in yours I promise you is when you face regret that is needless in other words it's regret that need not have been you you didn't have to end up like that you could have made different choices I got a recommendation to you young people listen to your pastor today find you somebody well older than you seasoned who you can see has faith in God and loves the Lord and believes the word and has already made the mistakes you made and has repented and has set their sales for home you you if you want to be enamored with somebody be enamored with that person find yourself a sage somebody of wisdom somebody that you can admire and pattern because they know what they're talking about because they've been there they've done that and they don't even want to tell you how many T-shirts they have wow my closet got so overran I just had to burn some and so because life is so short by the time the judgments are realized it's already on you and that's just what I can tell you from experience there you know you're you're because especially when you're young a lot of times you're not able to comprehend that high altitude view that God use to set all your priorities correctly it can't occur it can't occur to you let me just say it like that it can't occur to me it didn't it can't occur to you uh that consequences that are not see able right now they're not seeable right uh right right at this moment and uh and and perhaps even for decades but there those consequences that might not be seen for decades are actually being formed by the seed you're sewing in the decade you're in now see and so it's the one you're in presently and it's all happening in real time so you don't notice it so well this is why God sends his word because he knows what I just told you he knows you can't really grasp it and really see it and lest you sow seeds of discrepancy uh in your life right now and I said to you this time that last time that seeds of discrepancy are some of the most reliable crop you can plant nature will see to it I said to you last time I'm going to say it again they don't even need Faith to make them come up the sinful Fallen world that you live in will bring them to harvest trust me this is exactly why God sends his word so you can avoid sewing the wrong seed which which more often than not sadly comes up much later with very little remedy this is why God sends his word this is why God sends you a highflying prophet because highflying prophets they're so valuable because they they they're like eagles and they soar High they're the ones who are built by the Lord to fly high enough to see the regrets that you'll have when you fill yourself or your life with the East Wind yeah this is the astronaut age that is a unique characteristic of this age we have spent a long time getting here the church has been going forward for 20 centuries 2,000 years to get to now it's had its ins and outs and its ups and downs its successes and failures and that first church age fell away I'm here to tell you we are an astronaut age and as such we are built to fly high above this crumbling world that's crumbling around us you're built you're uniquely built to fly high above it brother brandham says in Christ is the mystery of God revealed the church this is a profound statement the church is the blood of Christ by the spirit now you can't get that outside of the word it's impossible that's why it's a bleeding word because it got life in it that's why denominations can't never hit it because that's man-made systems see the only one who can give you a bleeding word is the same one that the only one who can give you the token the only one who who had the seal the one who ascended from the East and stopped the judgments having the Seal of the Living God is the Holy Ghost he's the only one who can seal you in and set your life in the correct path see so in this astronaut age brother brandham says it this way the church is the blood of Christ by the spirit I elected on purpose not to have a PowerPoint I just want your your attention right here the church is the blood of Christ by the spirit because the life is in the blood that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost we've been teaching on that brother Brad has been teaching in the young people's sessions going to teach on it some more today at the end of our Gathering brother Matt has been teaching on it uh very astutely and and so we we're finding a prophet says here it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost that baptizes us into his body I mean don't young people don't worry about getting elected into a student body how about you get baptized into his body don't worry about there a certain group of friends that you would like to be on the IT Crowd don't worry about that body of friends worry about being baptized into his body it's the B it baptizes us into his body that recognizes only his body his flesh his word denominations won't never touch that it's a revelation she knows it so did watch now so did Eve know it see now he's going to show you you're a unique age you're we can make types and shadows from Eve and relate them to you we can make types and Shadows of Sarah and relate them to you of Rahab and relate them to you of Mary and relate them to you but but but the prophet is coming to say there's an unprecedented group that have never been in the earth in this level watch what he says denominations won't touch that never touch that it's a revelation she knows it so did Eve know it but she fell but this one this bride this one knows it and won't fall the early church fell but this bride knows it and won't fall she's ordained Hallelujah she is ordained to not fall she won't fall she's predestinated to it blessed now listen that's not just like oh happy day oh lucky day oh I've won the lottery I'm predestinated to not fall you've made mistakes this week you you'll make mistakes tomorrow what do you mean she's predestinated to not fall listen to what it's based on she is ordained to not fall she won't fall she is predestinated to it and he goes to the scripture uniquely uniquely for this age it's a scripture way old many thousands of years old the church has rejoiced over it but in the unique age of a bride that's predestinated not to fall elected not to fall he goes back and picks up a prophecy concerning Christ that David wrote about blessed is the man who God will not impute sin am God has sent this team of astronauts to not fall and the astronauts that that that that that this prophecy is speaking of it's not that we won't make mistakes it's that in this age they can't count because that's how unique this ages that you are predestinated not to fall say but I do fall it won't count why because I'm under a bleeding word denominations will never do that man-made thinking can't can't do that what you do then you have to pay for it but he's saying when you are in possession of the bleeding word when you have the token life then the blood speaks for me every moment of my existence and even if I do make a mistake he'll drive me to my knees and I'll repent and I'll come with the unleavened bread of sincerity and I'll say father forgive me and he will and you'll go right on in Victory and Satan will lose every ability to accuse you these astronauts that prophecy tells us are to be here right now here's my question is that you amen then say it's me it's me Hallelujah there's astronauts supposed to be here it's me say what about your ups and downs yeah I got them but it's me it's not because I was a great person or I'll be a better person tomorrow I'll be a if I fall I'll just be more humble and I'll owe God more than I already owe him that I can never already can't pay but I'm here to tell you that's the strength and the power of a bleeding [Applause] word forsake it and doom yourself because it's the only place of safety have you relinquished the world and taken the bleeding word for your day be honest have you take I I'm not saying are you live a perfect life I'm asking you today young and old Alik have you made a decision to say you need to make a decision you sure do here it is I'm done with the world I want the word I'm down how many will raise a hand to that say I might have mistakes I do make mistakes but I am I deny the world I don't want the world I want Christ I want his word I want a token I want it to be on display amen hallelujah the word and the word only that can wash you clean and exempt you from failures that you are sure to have we found in our study going from past how we read in Psalm 78 such a powerful Psalm we read verses 5 through 39 we're not going to even reread it today but we found out there that you know the the the Asaf is recounting the Chronicles of Israel coming out of Egypt and it's it's just rehearsal Force how that they you know they murmured and they complained and different things like that and and the Bible says that he caused an East Wind to blow in the heaven now this was right as he was they were complaining about Mana they did they got tired of heavenly food they wanted something more from the Earth get me they got tired of heavenly diet they wanted something more from the earth something that their fallen bodies craved more than just Angels food I'm sure you see the connection and so God was going to send them quail and he was going to send them so much that it would just they couldn't even consume them all they would die in the camp and stack up and they couldn't even eat them fast enough and they rotted and stank and Jesus picks that up and shows that the reason God did that was to show that mankind shall not live by bread alone but by every word so it's not any certain food you thought it was Angel's food you thought it was quail you thought it was the rock the water that came out of the Rock and Jesus said I am actually that water I am actually that bread Moses didn't give you that bread you think he did he didn't he didn't give you me he gave you a wafer and mana and gave you Quail till you got sick you couldn't even eat it anymore just like the law gave them the law to prove to them they couldn't keep it so that all men could become guilty and before him and nobody could have a claim see so that if he rescues you and gives you eternal life it's all on him and you you can't take any credit all you can do is be a guilty Sinner and raise up your hands and say Lord I accept your pardon nothing in my arms I bring simply to thy cross I cling and so he sent this East Wind to blow in the heavens and the Bible says and by his power he brought in the south wind and we told you last time that it became a Southeast wind which was a mixture of judgment from God's justice and his Mercy that is in his love because his H Mercy rejoiceth against judgment his throne is established in Mercy Mercy the Bible tells us and this is I would say a Southeast wind is the one that I've encountered the most and I dare say it's the one you've encountered the most because it's when I went in the wrong direction and God sent an East Wind of judgment but he also turned it a little bit and it became a south wind became a Southeast and and I knew he was he was he was spanking me but I knew he loved me I knew this was his hand of judgment but but it was based on love I knew that he was bringing me and said now son I'm going to have to do this it pains me just like any father would tell a child children don't believe that when the father says it hurts me more than it hurts you and the children say Dad we all want you to hurt [Laughter] yourself but it truly does because God loves his people he's like a father like a mother he he loves his family he loves his children and sometimes he has to bring the East Wind but I I I I think it was uh might have been brother Caleb I think was preaching here about how you know that God doesn't bring judgment on his family he brings correction that's a different it might look and feel like judgment but it's correction it's God's corrective love I'm so glad he operates that way in our lives it's often God's way of working with Humanity particularly those of his own family he operates in our lives uh in this way intermingling correction and Grace at the same time any preacher that really is under the anointing of the holy spirit will preach it like that that he'll preach judgment he won't he won't hold back he'll preach it Gunbarrel straight if he knows what's good for him but he'll also give the people hope that there is love and there is forgiveness and there is Grace I don't believe in brow beating people and taking hope away from people I don't care what you position you have put yourself in today the medicine that comes comes out of the doctor's bag might be bitter and have a lot of side effects you ain't going to like but take it please take it because it only gets more and more bitter and the side effects only become more and more dire so just take it now if you're here today and your life is going in the wrong direction take the medicine now we ended last time and I as you can see I'm intermingling old and new thoughts and I'm just struggling in my mind a little bit because the real burden on my heart I don't know if I'll get to it today I'd like to but it's up to the Lord but we found and we we were saying to you last time trying to teach you a concept that that we say you know God works in mysterious ways his his wonders to perform or sometimes it's quoted his wonders to behold and we were showing you last time that that a lot of times you you're in the middle of something and you know you don't really understand what God is doing because it's mysterious but if you'll just keep going in the right direction that it'll become a Wonder that'll be performed and you'll behold it and you'll see it my so the message is trust the Lord now it's interesting I didn't have time to go into this last time that's one of those Bible principles that though we say it in that way it's actually not a direct quotation from scripture though it's often thought to be God moves in mysterious ways his wonders to perform it's actually from uh a drama written out by a Christian Author uh hundreds of years ago but brother brandham quotes it we've quoted it and it's it's kind of like um there's some other ones like that like born in uh born in sin shap and iniquity come into the world speaking lies that's not actually a Bible verse that's a mashup of several Bible verses it's a principle it teaches a principle God moves in mysterious ways his wonders to perform or his wonders to behold that's a mashup of a number of Bible principles put together so that you can catch the thought behind it you understand so it becomes very useful in fact is the word mysterious doesn't even really appear uh in the King James at all it does appear in other translations although it's not very common you know a lot of times a a mystery is used instead the word mystery is used throughout uh and and those refer to divine secrets known only through Revelation those are things that you want to be interested in but you want God to reveal them by Revelation you have and I don't I don't want to dive too deeply into this today because it's just theological stuff but there's a Greek word uh Mysterion uh which in the original Greek manuscripts is described in the gospels as the word secret see so the term is often Associated then with deeper spiritual truths of Christianity that are relevant to Believers and relevant to your life you know it it it these things become important to us more important than you might think because because sometimes wording is everything I'm always very selective and very careful how I explain something the Bible is extremely meticulous it doesn't use even one word needlessly every jot and tit every Iota that's just punctuations everything there even the the sense of the word is vital to God he he values his word you know above his name his word is is the highest thing because his name has evolved his word is the same yesterday today and forever so he values his word even above his name you understand so so we realize then that how many believe in a supernatural God the if you what you'll find is a lot of times that the world is generally uh they they don't like that word so much because if you that what they change it to is Magic or magical or it becomes Harry Potter you know or it becomes some of these Disney they've got so many spin-offs now uh a spin-off of a spin-off of a spin-off and everything about superheroes and magic powers and you know they don't want to use Supernatural because if you use Supernatural then you got to admit there's a supernatural being and then if you admit they're a supernatural being then you're responsible to him and that's what they don't they don't want they want to avoid that so they water it down they they change the the jargon they you know background noise noise is actually how you in that's in military you know Jamming 101 that's what that's what jamming is is it it it creates it creates noise so that the seeking device that's seeking here's a missile tracking a jet and a lot of times that jet can do all kinds of countermeasures he can drop flares he can drop chaff he can dive down to the deck and and and and then the missiles got to Chas him down into heavier atmosphere and it slows it down and then the missile looking at all the ground and then there's got to find a jet in there because the ground becomes background noise photographers understand background noise and so background noise is how you limit detection and I I want you to know Satan makes big use out of it he makes big use out of background noise and social media platforms and uh and Hollywood particularly Hollywood are leading noise makers they're leading noise makers and Satan uses them you know what he does he uses it to jam the signal coming from the throne that's for you see brother Brandon now watch watch this this progression we're going to go to 57 to 61 to 63 and then later at 63 1957 first year of America under judgment he said if you get back to to the spiritual side of it in the oldfashioned prayer meetings and take the comic books and all the old true life stories and things off your table and put the Bible there and get a wholesome literature Prophet wasn't opposed to Wholesome literature he read wholesome literature and you get wholesome literature it would be different around your house look at what he's saying that you could actually change the atmosphere now he can't talk about computers and iPads and cell phones and social media because they don't exist you understand so he's in 1957 he's just hitting at true story magazines and and he's going to hit cards and he's going to hit comic books see and so what does he say in 1957 this is what the devil was using to add background noise see and he's saying if you'd get if You' get that stuff out of your house and put the Bible out there and hold some literature out there it would be different it would affect your house it would change the atmospheres is this okay see it would change the atmospheres around you he says then in 1961 four years later the son of thou son of David have mercy on me he says but today with all now watch him he's gonna he's going to evolve with all of our modern convenience boy and how do we got them today with all of your modern convenience and instead of reading the Bible to our children we'll turn the television on and let them look at something that's not even fit for them to look at now that's right see that's right and and that that doesn't even touch what we've done with phones and tablets Come on holy people let's own it don't don't go quiet on me all right and he says it's not even fit for them to look at that's right and another thing we'll give them and he goes back and pulls up an oldie Goldie we'll we'll give them these little comic books of little old story books boy they've got them now that make those back there look like Child's Play they've got them now filled with all kinds of Supernatural demons and Ghouls and they call it magic it's noise it's Satan permeating the atmosphere with noise it's Jam the signal that you need for Holiness and righteousness and some drugstore mantle they'll have these story books there that watch what a prophet says oh I love this Kentucky thinking that oughtn't even to be sold to make kindling wood out of a fire for a fire and yet listen what he says to the nation and yet we poke all that kind of stuff down our children's neck see so then it it so then it they the these things water down the effects and the and the influence of the of a supernatural God in your life that's what they do they water down it's background noise it floods the atmospheres it floods their minds and yours it takes up space in the minds of our children that is really needed to receive the word of God they add noise and confusion to our minds this is why a prophet said the greatest battle ever fought is in the mind that God and Satan agreed that we're going to battle for the control of man's heart and that's going to come through the influence and the things we take into our mind so stop filling your home your life your mind your kids with the East Wind it's just background noise to jam the signal of the word that you you come here not just children not just young people not just college level but adults and deacons and preachers and officers and if we're not careful our minds are so sponged we can't even rejoice and clap our hands and sing a song and praise God even though the Bible says enter his gates with Thanksgiving that you are to give him the the what his name is due the the the reward and the and the prestige and the honor the Bible says that his name is due this is the Battleground the effect is that neither you nor your family clearly hear the voice of the Lord as you should and it shows as if that were not bad enough these things from the Tree of knowledge these seeds of discrepancy that fill our minds are actually poisonous seeds that have both an immediate and a long-term consequence amen now brother brandham comes to 1963 all right you still with me I'm going to turn a corner and run for home all right just hang on don't don't don't run out just hear me out brother random says in 63 just one more time lord I've just once more Lord he preached it another time I've been so glad for that title over the years you know because when actually when Samson said it he said just this once and man I've had so many Samson moments that if it would have been just this once I would have been finished but I'm glad a Prophet come along and said just once more Lord and I've been able to say just once more I know yeah last I get it but once more Lord I know last week I shouldn't but once more Lord hallelujah just one more time Lord you fathers you mothers are you ready to establish an altar in your house and take that television out are you ready to take that deck of cards off the table them comic books now catch it he's in his progression them comic books that your children's reading here's a Prophet Insight this is pro this is an eagle flying high that can see it he can see what you can't see see them comic books that your children's reading preparing their little Minds for a blast that the devil's going to give them are you ready to establish the old family altar again or do you just want to continue on the way you are you want to continue on you're not in condition of coming yet but I pray that you're like Samson that you see the price and you're ready and say Lord let me die with them he says in further on in 63 this is my last quote I think I have August 1963 how can I overcome interesting title valuable valuable how can I overcome we see this age that we're living in stop full stop do you do you really see the age that you're living in because your life will tell whether you really see it whe whether you're taking even this sermon today to heart and taking it seriously and de I can tell you I don't care how IM affected you feel starting with an a affected you might feel unless you leave here and with an E effect change then you're not getting it the only difference between effect and effect is one letter but it's all the difference in the world right see people get affected Paul said that but then they go out and forget what manner of man the Bible the mirror showed them they were they looked at it and my goodness I really need help and then go right out that door and go I'm fine I have I have need of nothing I'm increased with Goods I have need of nothing I don't need God I don't need a prophet I don't need the token I don't need the Holy Ghost you're wrong he says here we see this age that we're living in it's one of boy this blew my mind if it wasn't for the next paragraph it's one of the grandest ages of all ages I'm like wait what this leoan church age is the grandest of all the church ages because oh okay give me the reason because it's the ending of time and the blending of Eternity yeah woo amen I agree it's the greatest of all the ages because it's the ending of time and the blending of Eternity and then now in perfect contradistinction and then it's the greatest sinful age and how it's more sin in this age than there's ever been I'm describing to you why your age is unique and I'm using kindergarten time to point it out to you what is it now it's more sin in this age than there's ever been and the powers of Satan in the kindergarten days in 1963 and the powers of Satan uh is let me let me and the powers of Satan is many times harder to fight against than it was in any age see here it's so deceiving this is the great age of deception when Christ said so the two Spirits would be so close in the last days that it would deceive the very elected if it was possible see see see remember your Prophet say remember Christ spoke of an elected people for the last day it would deceive the very elected if it were possible so close the people live sorry the people so live people can live a clean holy life not be sinful adulterers and Drinkers and liars and gamblers they can live above that and still not with it now when I first started reading that line I was ready to Rejoice go yes Hallelujah I can live above it I cannot be an adulterer I cannot be a drinker a liar a gambler live a clean holy life and and live above it hallelujah praise the Lord and still not with it wait huh still not with it this is why the token life is so important this is why the age is so unique listen friends and I and I and I I'm going to end right here because I don't have time to keep going and I want I just feel led to move to the real burden of my heart although I'll come back to it and preach it more extensively but but it was brother brandham when he was telling for the first time in 1961 in Paradox and you're still with me you got 10 minutes left poor Americans got 10 minutes I know these seats are cushy but endure it AC feels great but just hang on don't start crying so brother brandham comes to the pull pit and he's I'll close my Bible so you know that I'm I'm done help it'll help me too but he he comes and he starts telling these experiences and it's you're familiar with it I promise it's when he was on the road and he said I saw myself on a map of Palestine lot going on in Palestine right now and he said' I looked back and he said I could see I was two-thirds of the way to to crossing the Jordan and the into the promised land and he said and I was walking along this road and he said there was high Weeds on both sides and he said there was there was something among the people there was an atmosphere of fear and confusion and brother Brenham and there's a friend with him are you a friend he's got a friend with him and and he brother Bram said I could sense there was a fear in there was in the atmosphere and he said I said what's what's wrong what is everybody so afraid of and he says about that time I heard it coming through the weeds and I heard it crashing and as soon as I saw it he said I knew immediately it was a Mamba and he said this is such a deadly Viper he said you've got the this king cobra and you've got the yellow Cobra and you've got all the said said and they're very deadly too he said but when when I was in Africa and I've talked to African Brothers whove confirmed this said that when even when he said when those natives would even say somebody would yell out Mambo he said they would just smash their heads into each other trying to run and get away they're so terrified of it and he said because it's it's just instant death as soon as you get bitten you've just got minutes to live and that's how toxic the Mamba is and he said and they they they they move quickly and they strike hard and he said a lot of times they come across the top of the grass and they they they jump and he said they people get struck high in the face and and he said and and here it came out onto the road and everybody's screaming and he said and it came at me and he said and as it made a charge it started coming at me hard and said it started getting slower and slower and slower and it got right up to me and it started shaking and it couldn't get me and he said so it doubled back and it circled around and here it come again and he said it came hard and it got slower and slower and slower and it couldn't get me and he said I stood there looking at it and he said and then it went after my friend I'm here to tell you something friends a prophet's long ago gone and we're not yet in the promised land and this thing is striking at the friend of a Prophet this thing is striking at our lives trying to it it's sudden death one bite and you're done and so he he says I said I saw my friend and he was jumping up and jumping around trying to get away and it was trying to strike at him and he said I cried out oh God have mercy if it hits him it'll kill him he said it's just one bite it's sudden death and that's what every that's what had everybody so Disturbed and he said a voice spoke to me and said you've been given power to bind him Hallelujah and he said he said Satan I bind you in the name of Jesus Christ and he said when I said that he said blue smoke which represented his life he said it flew out of him came out of his mouth and said he curled up and he he brought his tail up around and he said it made the an symbol like if you're texting and you see the an symbol that goes like this and comes up and loops and goes down and then and then it it loops around the beginning it's an an symbol like a backwards s and he said and his own tail curled around and come down went around his own throat and he choked his own self out and he fell over and he said I walked up and he said I I thought he said I thought now this is a vision I got to figure out what this is about CU he didn't understand it and he said I kicked at it and he said it had become like glass and it just laid there in that symbol choked out dead and he said the spirit said you've also been given power to loose him wow and he said okay I'm just going to test it Satan in the name of I loose you in the name of Jesus Christ and he said as soon as I said that that blue smoke went right back in him he started to uncurl started to come conscious and brother Bram said quickly I said I bind you in the name of Jesus and he said and the blue smoke went back out of him what is it showing friends that blue smoke was life it meant that the greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world Satan is real he has a life but there's a greater life there's a token life in this bride in this unique bride of this unique age has Zenith never before had he had 6,000 years to finishes Eden until now when Paul faced him he'd only been 4,000 years in building now he's had 6,000 years and brother Brown said just as God took 6,000 years to build his Eden now Satan's had 6,000 years to build his this is a trying time and just and and and and Paul talks about the perilous times at the end time and how that Satan would become the god of the evil age the god elected by the people in worship no age has had to face that no age has ever had to face the days of Noah and the days of lot simultaneously we have to face them simultaneously you understand this is a unique hour no wonder God sent a unique word with a unique Ministry to give you a unique experience say is it different it's a restoration of the original and and so when brother brandham comes out of that he says now if your house is like my house he said by that time he said I'd gotten up very early and he said I came to in my study and I said Lord what does this mean and he said the next thing I hear I hear alarms going off Ma's getting up she's getting the kids everybody's getting ready for school he said if if your house is like my house he said it's you can't even hear yourself think and he said I'm walking around trying to help you time to get up time to get ready breakfast is being cooked children where's my book bag where's my clothes where's get out of the bathroom you know I need in there all the kind of stuff and brother brandham says he said I I just couldn't hear myself think and he said I I slipped back in and closed the door and he said I got down and I said Lord Jesus in just a little bit they're going to call for me I got to take the kids to school Lord I I got to know what this means it's very troubling what what does this mean please help me quickly and he says that and and he says now I don't like to do this he says but and he tells all this in Paradox 61 and he says I don't like to do this we don't like to fleece God like that he said but I remember back in the day when I'd open my bible and it go right to Joshua 9 and he said and he told me just as he had been with Moses he'd be with me and nothing will stand before you and footsteps mean possession and all that all that all that and brother brandom said for years he said it didn't matter he said I could be in front of anybody and he said I just open my bible and it open right there to Joshua and he says now he said I remembered he said Lord I don't like doing it this way but I'm in a I I'm in desperate I'm in a hurry because of Life can you please help me and he said I didn't look and he said I just turned and he said I just went like that and I looked and he said I was pointing at 1 Corinthians 58 where we read our text this morning and our and and the point that he read was he says Purge out therefore the old leaven that you may be a new lump as ye are unleavened for even Christ Our Passover is sacrificed for us see therefore let us keep the feast not with old leaven neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and Truth see because brother brandham had been told in the vision when you see this Mamba and you're able to bind him like that he said now you're going to have to be more sincere than you have been wow and that blows my mind yeah and it does yours and I'm thinking every time I read that as a boy I thought goodness gracious what more could he do and and if he hasn't been sincere of what in the world am I going to do the friend who it's gone after and I'm jumping all in one strike and I'm gone how if a prophet isn't sincere enough but brother brandham comes back now he's getting getting the interpretation and the Lord is telling him that the the interpretation is the word that this is how you're going to achieve the sincerity that you need not because you're going to have to suffer more or talk in lower tones or be even more humble than you've already been or give away you know more of your goods it's not about that it's that we're at the end time in a unique hour when a unique word is coming and you're going to believe that word and your belief and that word is going to give you the sincerity you need to operate this principle Hallelujah come on so when he comes in this age you're going to need this message and it's going to need to be a revelation amen it's going to have to be something real it can't just be Doctrine it can't just be books and tapes and quotes it's a person and it's got to live inside you that's the only way you're going to be able to bind him and lose same Hallelujah and and and and we find that it's the sincerity you can't come with the old leaven see you can't come in other words there's two principles showing here and here's what I'm I'm going to run out of time but I want to just give you this there's two principles that he's talking about when he says you know your your Christ is now uh for even Christ Our Passover sacrific for us Purge out therefore the old leaven that you might be a new lump for ye are unleavened that so I don't have time today I'll get to it later we'll look at the we'll look at the feast days of Israel because he was the unleavened bread then he was the he was the Passover then he was the first fruits and then Pentecost and Pentecost runs all the way to the Rapture and then the the last three trumpets five six and seven go to Israel and so that's why the the Jubilee that's why the token had to come back full strength today so that the Omega could be the alpha Hallelujah only the alpha fell and backslid and they were already backsliding when Paul is writing to them he says look there's fornication among you don't be proud of this is terrible you need to take that man out from under the blood the ending of the story is they did and he repented and everything got fixed and he got restored later but but but but the church was already backsliding the church was already going carnal they were already watering down the Doctrine they were already contemplating you know you had the Deeds of the nicians you had the spirit of balum you had all of this thing moving among them and they started getting this idea that if they were in our modern day it would have to be titled message light already had started watering it down and he's saying you can't do that because the only thing that can make you from old leev of sin when you had when you had uh malice and wickedness you you've got to become a new lump and the only way to do that the only way to get the token is don't water the message down you got to have the unleavened the unleavened means no contamination it's unleavened there's no man-made thinking in it and so that see that's the mistake that they kept making in the ages wow it wasn't then it didn't become just a sinful just like when you at the pyramid it's an individual but it's also the ages amen so so Not only was it a message to individuals but now that as an age what they what they kept doing was was he they they it says here Purge out therefore the 11 that you may be a new lump for your unle for even Christ Our Passover sacrificed for us this is why we need the pure word this is why we can't have message light this is why you can't move the ancient landmarks this is why you can't make 2024 and fill it full of all kinds of carnal and exceptions to a message that ended in' 65 cuz it didn't end in 65 but it's the original word and you got to stay with it because it's unleavened but see here's what they did therefore let us keep the feast not with old leaven neither with the leav of malice see this is where brother brandham said this is what they did that a seal partially broke and a mystery dropped and a messenger caught it and ran with it and it gathered a bride and then he went off the scene and then Ricky and ricettas got in there and organized it all and what what were they doing that was the malice they didn't want that pure word anymore they they were against it and they begin to denominate it it was all the Antichrist and we've come to the last age here the most unique hour and you and and this is Satan's attempt is even to move among God's family and try to get them to water down the message and water down the word that's the same Spirit of antichrist that operated in the ages but you've got to be an unleavened bride you can't run with that system anymore the old leaven that that old way of doing it doesn't work anymore oh Christ has become My Sacrifice Christ has become the Living Word and it's a token life that is living inside of our lives living inside of our homes guiding us so that we're not we're not beset by all the noise this is why God brought it to a prophet at the end time and took him back to First Corinthians 5 and said now you'll have to be more sincere to have this kind of power say well what's up with that kind of power you're going to need it for what's coming not only what's coming what was coming in 1961 but what is here now I think about the sincerity and it's preaching from my heart I think about the levels of sincerity that I've seen come into people's lives just on National tragedy that's a good topic because yesterday I I told you that I looked at a headline and the headline before I left to come to church was are we on the brink of global war cuz now you got a Sovereign Nation not a proxy you've got a Sovereign Nation attacking Israel and Israel had already said you know it's nothing hezbollah's been sending rockets at us okay fine so is Hamas we're not going to attack Iran for that we're going to bomb Syria because they house them we're going to invade the Gaza and we're going to put them down but we're not going to attack AR we know they're sending them the missile and the rockets and the drones but they're not personally attacking us they're doing through proxies however if they personally attack us then we will retaliate and last night in the face of that Iran a Sovereign Nation sends about 300 they first start sending drones and then they start sending cruise missiles and then they start sending ballistic missiles you who was no there was no natural you can see that it's it's all it's all that demonic Islam because there was the brother JD can tell you there was no historic Rift between the Jews and the Persians the Persians took them out out from the Babylonians and the Persians and there was a Persian king Cyrus who let him go back and build a tabernacle build a temple so it was it wasn't until 1979 when the islamist took over Iran that then they started stating we need to annihilate Israel and this hatred begin it's been going for 40 years it's not a it's not a Jewish Persian thing it's a Hebrew Islamic thing and now you've got America saying you know we're going to defend and then you get Russia jumping in saying if America does the least little thing to Iran they need to know we will come to the support of our friends I'm here to tell you something friends you're on this world's on sinking sand and this thing is coming apart and God is knowing that the greatest thing right now is this delusion in the minds to take the message and make it a light version and water it down and disregarded and changed the ancient landmarks you'll never get the token like that and if you don't get the token you won't get out of here you'll go down with Ash and Cinder with it I promise you only those who are part of the first resurrection leave the Earth Hallelujah and that's what I want to be part of and God has sent a word that can bring you into the first resurrection and make you a new lump not an old Le not not the old way not your old Sins not the old way of the ages of of of waiting for the messenger to go away and then you come later on and you start criticizing him and tearing him down and start preaching a water down version and start drawing people out nonsense those people are going to end up in a tribulation God's their judge but I'm I'm headed home in a body change because I'm a new lump Christ my Passover is an unleavened lump Hallelujah is that the kind of word that you want today I want to be an unleavened lump I want to be have an unleavened God an unleavened word something that can permeate my home and permeate my mind and permeate the lives of my family who I love oh let's stand to our feet friends I'm completely out of time but this this is the burden of my heart today this was where God sent a prophet back to you're going to need this kind of power and he knew that in 1961 where are you and I've seen as I said I've seen sincerity right now we've got a national crisis right now they're saying wow they didn't just fire drones they fired cruise missiles that's that's next level then they did the unthinkable they fired ballistic missiles hard to detect hard to hit if they had been nuclear tipped this would be a whole different morning and they want nuclear weapons for their it's one thing for them to claim it's just for energy and and then out of the other side of their mouth they're saying we want the annihilation of Israel yeah how do you figure that working like Brother JD said the song from The River To The Sea what happens to Israel I can tell you what happens to them they don't exist that's that's not the Mandate of people there are those Arab people are some of the I've met Arab Muslims some of the most noble honest trustworthy people I've walked through Arab countries and meet some woman in her 20s walking down a back alley at 3 in the morning we're coming home for meetings and we pass her in an alley nobody's touching her she's not afraid because they know what would happen and and in one way they're more righteous than the nauseating not righteousness of so-called Christianity which isn't righteousness at all it's not even Christianity at all it's nonsense for make it don't have anything to do with it we're not talking about the people we're talking about we have brothers and sisters who were of that who are now Believers of this message it's the C Gene goes all around the world thank God thank God Hallelujah we I'm talking about the people I'm not here in support of Pharisees say you don't support Israel of course I do true Israel I don't support Pharisees th those when those when those CI guys die I and I see the headline they blew up this terrorist they blew up this terrorist I just can't stop myself from saying welcome to Hell there you go surprise but you know who they're down there with Pharisees Sadducees they're down there with people Through the Ages who rejected the message of their hour this is not about some nationalist spirit this is about an allegiance to the lamb this is about an allegiance to righteousness and the and the unleavened bread sincerity and I've seen people get very sincere for a while they're very sincere right now we saw it I you know I I remember being sitting in a church service just like this except it's a Wednesday night or might have been a Sunday night it's a night service I think it was a Sunday night and no one knew well as soon as we got there church just started up everybody was at church we didn't have cell phones and things like we have today nobody was texting in church back then in like they shouldn't be today and and suddenly the preacher comes out preaches whole sermon he preaches invasion of the USA takes it from Brother bram's 195 seven or eight six something like that invasion of the USA very good sermon and it comes to the end and everybody's just a just a Sunday night service and everybody's enjoyed it we're getting ready to be dismissed church is full of like this got young people middle people older people and he says now I didn't want to say it at the beginning of the service and he knew none of us knew it because we didn't have that kind of technology and he just says now I didn't want to say it before the church before the service he said but he said the war has started this was the Gulf War in 91 and he said the war has started and he if he hadn't said it like this he said the bomb has been dropped and everybody was like he just felt everybody freeze and he said the war's on y'all it's happening right now bombs are falling and he and he looked to the back and he called out a brother brother you're supposed to call your mother right away I had a message sister so and so right away your husband he's unbeliever he wants you to call him straight away and all of a sudden you hear people start crying young people who hadn't moved under the spirit of God in years suddenly jumped out in the aisle and ran to the altar fell at an altar screaming crying to God for Mercy I thought why did it take that and more than half the ones who fell and cried for Mercy once they realized it wasn't a nuclear bomb and we won it in six days anyhow then suddenly they went right back to the world I saw them get all sincere in 911 and the whole nation I remember a preacher said one time he said isn't it amazing the the the from the White House Down they're saying everybody needs to be praying and the whole nation is praying but nobody's repenting there's a big difference between praying and repenting and nobody was repenting and after a while they stopped praying and and what does it take listen I don't want some national catastrophe to make me sincere I want to come under the presence of the word of God today young people you need to be sincere you need to bring the unleavened bread of sincerity stop flirting around with the world stop accepting a watered down message stop accepting the carnality that is clearly outside of the bounds of the word of God we're a church who wants the power of God we want the Sovereign authority of God I want the knowledge of God we don't want I want Holiness I want righteousness I want sincerity in my life and your life and we're not here to use the old malice the old way of the ages that's what the scripture is saying don't go back and be a sinner anymore but hey you age don't go back and do like the ages did because Christ has descended and opened the book and we now have a bleeding word Christ the unle the unleavened bread is your sacrifice and you owe your life to him you owe your allegiance to him let's pray amen father I thank you for your word today I thank you Lord that you enabled me to unburden myself Lord to a certain degree there's much more to say we'll hold it for another time I think enough's been said Lord now I want to give it to the Holy Ghost and Lord oh while on others Thou Art calling do not pass me by Lord we all have a need of you today young and old from the platform and the pull pit to the to the entry door we all have a need of you father I pray Lord God that you won't need a Southeast wind blowing in my life anymore no Lord no oh God I want to feel the breezes of your pleasure in my life of your acceptance of My Sacrifice I want to bring the unleavened bread of sincerity before you today I don't need a national crisis or a global crisis we already know that's going to be till the Lord comes it's only going to get worse and worse and worse and after that then it's going to get much worse it can't get better Lord it must get worse as a prophet said it's going and is and will get worse and be totally insane there'll be no there'll be no peace till Jesus comes and turns it all around so Lord I pray that you will help us today all the noise that Satan has filled our lives with filled our homes with filled our minds with parents have been infected children have been infected churches have been infected Purge it out Lord that's the command of the Apostle Purge it Purge out the old Leen don't come to him like that come with the sincere the unleavened bread of sincerity become a new lump something that the power of God the Shina of Glory can live he can undo all the damage fix all the wrong crop those seeds of discrepancy he can do away with it and bring up a garden of God's life Lord may you grant it today I pray as we commit it to you I commit this people this audience into your hands Lord I preached everything that was on my heart and everything and Lord I was preaching to me today not just these people so I pray for your mercy now help us Lord to become a new lump today we live in a unique hour a unique time we have a unique word a unique plan a unique Revelation this is a unique moment when the bride will go back where that early church fell and tipped over and started to decline we'll go right back to that point that's where we've already gone to we've went already we've went back to that point we've went back to the to the Jubilee we've went back to the Token we've went back to the abstract title hallelujah oh Lord God we don't have to conjure up a shout we have the shout of the king Hallelujah we don't have to work up a dance we we can dance like David danced Hallelujah Lord these are the things that you've made CA us capable of in this day we don't need a compromised word we don't need compromised lives I don't want a compromised word I want that which can bring me into your image Lord I pray you'll Grant it father I commit it to you in Jesus name let's sing Tony just before we go my boat of Life sails on a troubl sea whenever there's a wind in my [Music] S I have a
