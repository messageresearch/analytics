[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] good morning everyone god bless you so thankful to be here with you can't wait for the soon approaching hour that we'll all be together again and thankful to see things or the governor's starting to open things up in South Carolina and so we're it slowly in that process I love you all and can't wait to see you gathered together here again and with that said let's stand and pray a few of us that are gathered here father we just look to you Lord it's your spirit that's the teacher you promised us to guide us into all truth Lord and I just want to step myself out of the way Lord and let your spirit come and guide us Lord teach us may the spirit of Revelation work in every heart that's tuned in here Lord I pray for the families and those at home with young children and knowing how difficult many times it is to be able to focus with kids in their normal environment of play and running around to get snacks and so forth Lord help just I pray you'd calm everyone's spirit Lord calm the children's spirit help everyone to just sit and relax and enjoy your presence and receive something from your word Lord we commit ourselves to you and Jesus precious name Amen so we're onto part 7 of the mystery of the Godhead this time we'll be looking mostly at the birth baptism and crucifixion of Christ last time we we got a little bit into the birth or maybe a lot bit into the birth and I just wanted to kind of reiterate some of that maybe look at it from another angle and then move on to the baptism and crucifixion and then then if we get far enough we will talk about the fruits of Nicaea so let's go forward if we can if technology allows us when we turn it off and on all right so three significant events in Jesus life birth baptism and crucifixion Luke 1:35 and the angel answered and said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee now watch this next word therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God so why is Jesus the Son of God because he was a second koete erna person with the father no it says the Holy Ghost will overshadow you therefore which means because of this or based upon this action he's called the Son of God so why is Jesus the Son of God supernatural birth it's so simple so scriptural not not based on some eternal Godhead of three persons but the simple fact God who is a spirit overshadowed the Virgin created that that cell within her because of that he's the son of God why God is his father God is his progenitor so that leads us to look at some other things which is if he's the son of God I'm the son of Jim DeMars that means I carry and Susan DeMars I carry within myself their DNA so I have the life of Jim and Susan DeMars you know if if Jesus had the life of Mary then we have a problem because Mary was a sinner she would have passed her genetics onto them then we have to create as the Roman Catholics did a doctrine of Immaculate Conception which is that Mary was born without the stain of original sin therefore she could pass on her genetics to Jesus but this is a this is fanciful nonsense what we're talking about is the scripture as we read last time that we are saved by the blood of God that's in Acts chapter 20 so God doesn't have any blood he's a spirit he's invisible you can't even see him so what did he do he had an offspring he brought from his very own life and made the the whole DNA genetic structure the nature body soul and spirit made the man Christ Jesus so now this man is the exact imprint of the invisible God so God has now taken on a shape of form yes he's the son of God yes he's a man but God himself now has put a part of his life into human flesh to live a perfect life for us then we go to the baptism of Jesus Matthew 3:16 and 17 we've addressed this before that the Trinitarians use these verses to say spirit of god is descending son of god is in the water God the Father speaking from heaven see it's three persons it doesn't say anything about that and don't don't Trinitarians themselves believe it that God is omnipresent he can be in many many places at the same time so the Spirit of God can descend from heaven God can still be in heaven and the body of God the Son of God can be there on earth at the same time it's not a difficult concept to understand so when Jesus was baptized immediately he went up from the water and behold the heavens were opened to him and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming to rest on him and behold a voice from heaven said this is my beloved son with whom I am well pleased so so I'm gonna back up a second so think about this Jesus being the image of the invisible God so understand that God is outside of this dimension he's not limited by this too mention similar to how we you let you and I dwell in another dimension like called the Internet you and I for example the dimension of Facebook we have a profile on Facebook that profile is an expression of us that profile in facebook is us okay but we are not limited by that dimension we're also outside of that dimension we exist apart from that and yet we're in that dimension through our profile and that is the same way with God God's a spirit he's not limited by this he's completely out of this dimension he's not he's not limited by time space and matter whatsoever but God wanted to come into this dimension so he gave birth he brought his begotten Son forth from there now God is still apart from that you know you see the different instances in Jesus life he says lifts his eyes to heaven father the hour has come well the fullness was in him all he needed to do is look in the mirror well God is not merely limited this dimension Jesus was God made visible here in this dimension yet God is apart from that and outside of that amen okay so the baptism of Jesus now we have this these are some statements from brother Branham when he's discussing the baptism of Jesus what is it significance what happened there he showed that that where it says in whom I'm pleased well pleased he says in whom I'm pleased to dwell in he says God did not dwell in him until that time he says he became God he says he was anointed with God he said he became Emanuel he became the Messiah he was anointed with the Spirit of God at that time the fullness came down to dwell in him Jesus was always the exact imprint of God when you saw the baby you were seeing God when you saw the teenager you were seeing God but God had to come down and dwell in him and anoint him to activate him for his ministry then we go to the crucifixion of Christ in the Garden of Gethsemane brother Branham tells us the anointing left him in the garden we have Jesus on the cross saying my God my God why hast thou forsaken me so God forsook Jesus he left him in the garden and yet it was the blood of God that was there see it's it's a number one it's a revelation number two is you have to you have to let go of your preconceived ideas based on theology and just think like the scripture thinks all right so we have just to summarize those things the blood of God was born the DNA and exact imprint of God God came to dwell in Jesus in fullness at his baptism and the anointing left him in the garden those are the three steps to really give us a big picture of the Godhead and how in the relationship of Jesus Christ to the Godhead brother Branham says the man the body was not deity but deity was in the body now let me back up here people say oh my goodness what are you saying do you realize that Jesus only in Trinitarians don't believe that the body of Jesus Christ was God himself he was a man it was not God to the body but God was dwelling in the body and fully identified in that body and brother Branham MacLeod again and again makes that clear they say they were said we were for a good work we don't stone you because you're a man making yourself God he was God but brother Branham says the problem was it they was looking at that body that was born of Mary he says that wasn't God that was the son of God see it was God dwelling in that body God fully identified to that body so that when we look at that man we say that's the father that's God that's God tabernacling in a body of flesh that's God become a man a man we have to have we have to have the balance we don't want to throw out these statements of brother Branham and we don't want to throw out these statements of brother Branham we want to say yes and amen and keep it in a scriptural balance because you know the person that says emphasizes on the one side he says Jesus is not God all right the other one says Jesus is God he's the only true God okay so what about the other things that have been said what about the thousands of times that brother Branham said Jesus Christ was God is God okay what about the times that he did say he wasn't okay we don't want to ignore either those well what do we have to be afraid of what do we have to be ashamed of I don't have to fix what brother Branham said I'm not I'm not one of these preachers to come up and say well I'm gonna correct brother Branham know there's many there's many who have done it that that spirit has infected the message and all around the world there's people impacted by that nonsense I don't have to correct brother Branham God vindicated him and if there's a problem it's in my understanding of it and so that you know that's I I want to see the balance of it in the scriptures and if we don't if we ignore some quotes and accept only these quotes we have a problem brother Branham doesn't have a problem we have a problem so let's look at a few quotes as we kind of change directions here and kind of close up the portion talking about why the Trinity is false so here's the new international encyclopedia the Trinity doctrine the Catholic faith is this we worship one in Trinity but there is one person of the Father another of the son and another of the Holy Ghost the glory equal the Majesty Co eternal the doctrine is not found in its fully developed form in the scriptures modern theology does not seek to find it in the Old Testament at the time of the Reformation the Protestant church took over the doctrine of the Trinity without serious examination that is the new international encyclopedia speaking the truth Life magazine says this the Catholics made this statement concerning their doctrine of the Trinity to defend the dogma of the Assumption of Mary in article by Graham Greene our opponents sometimes claim that no belief should be held dogmatically which is not explicitly stated in the scripture but the protestant churches have themselves accepted such dogma as the trinity for which there exists no such authority in the gospels wow that's a mouthful this is the international encyclopedia 1st edition the doctrine of the trinity did not form part of the Apostles preachings as this is reported in the New Testament well from the Oxford Companion to the Bible because the trinity is such an important part of later Christian doctrine it is striking that the term does not appear in the New Testament likewise the developed concept of three co-equal partners in the Godhead found in later creedal formed formulations cannot be clearly detected within the confines of the Canon Wow these things should be staggering to anyone that's listening in that believes in a trinity of three persons it's not found in the Bible this is open it's not part of the apostles preachings that's openly admitted it was it was developed later also openly admitted these are shocking statements and ones that literally cannot be proven as false you can't go here and say oh look you know actually this is right in the Bible you can only you can only take this understanding and try to force it upon the Bible but there's so much that contradicts it that that the Trinity of three persons is absolutely proven to be a false doctrine proven to be a Catholic tradition that was accepted and carried on by the Protestants and so you know we're in good company to question this doctrine and say we have to return to the scriptures we have to turn away from false doctrine that was developed later our final authority is this book you've heard me emphasize this this Bible study again and again and again but this is an important point it's not the church is not defined our church is not the final authority I'm not the final authority even a prophet that comes after the Bible is written is not the final authority the Bible is the final authority and of course God vindicates vindicated brother Branham proved his message and yet that prophet told us make sure you're understanding it make sure you're hearing correctly make sure you're understand under standing and according to the scriptures he says all doctrine must be based on the Bible he didn't say all doctrine must be based on my quotes he said all doctrine must be based on the Bible his sermons and his messages were to point us back to the Bible now he wasn't pointing us back to the Bible so that we could take some things he said throw him away and other things that he said and accept them because we like we like this one quote we got 17 pages of quotes over here about this subject but we got one quote over here but that seems to be contradicting though it isn't but we'll accept this one and dismiss the rest or as I've seen people say as you're introducing them to the message we love the message but please don't teach us about modesty we don't like that part of it maybe brother Branham wasn't mistaken about that well I usually say well he preached the same thing from the very beginning until the very end and I believe the Lord would have corrected him about that there's other things the Lord corrected him about and any corrected himself on that but that is one point where from the beginning to the end it didn't even change one iota and so you know there's these things that people do that they they completely dismiss what brother Branham taught and we can't do that we can't do that and that's not what I'm saying when I say the Bible is the absolute some people hear you saying the Bible is the absolute and they say oh he's dismissing the Prophet no that's not right you know the word of the Lord comes to the Prophet God does nothing unless he reveals his secrets to the servants the prophets but if we try to take brother Branham and piece it together with our own understanding we're gonna come to some fantastic error but if we take brother Branham and say oh that's in the scripture let me search search it out in the word from Genesis to Revelation then the Spirit of God can take that and give you an understanding of what the Prophet said if we want to piece it together we'll have some nonsense and we'll bring destruction to ourselves and to those around us we need the Spirit of God you know it isn't a matter well we have the Prophet we don't need the Spirit of God the the tapes are the token well you and your flesh will take this message into idolatry you will turn you'll turn the prophet into an idol like now because Nebuchadnezzar did and you'll be embracing all kinds of false doctrines we need the Holy Spirit to guide us into all truth it didn't say I will send you the Prophet to guide you into all truth he said I'll send you the Holy Spirit the Spirit of Truth to guide you into all truth and then he says I'll send you prophets and teachers and so forth but we have to have that guide within us to lead us and guide us to what is true I'll give an example I got saved and I got the Holy Spirit I was still in a denominational Church but guess what the whole time God was leading and speaking to me and teaching me about so many different things that and then when the message when someone introduced the message to me it was just like okay he'd already been leading the Lord had already been teaching me these things now I hear the message like oh it's confirmed and now there's so much more that had no idea about that's coming the spirit leads us into all truth and it keeps us in the scripture that that's the problem too many times today as we don't return back to the Bible we don't love our Bibles we love the Prophet we love the message that's wonderful but we got to take it back to the scripture I don't know where we're at here we got time still so we'll continue on all right this is from the Encyclopedia Britannica on dogma and dogmatic theology the adoption of a non biblical phrase at Nicaea constituted a landmark in the growth of dogma the Trinity is true since the church the universal Church speaking by its bishops says so though the Bible does not we have a formula but what does that formula contain no child of the church seek to answer wow it's true because the universal church speaking by the bishops that's that's the Catholic doctrine that's what they believe is their final authority and their absolute the universal church speaking by it chips is above the Bible that's a mistake all right if I can quickly get through this the fruits of Nicaea of the Athanasian version of Christianity that we talked about the Athanasian Creed so Christianity had spread throughout the Roman Empire and beyond into Britain Norway Germany Russia Sudan Somalia all of North Africa into turkey into all of Turkey most of Iran Iraq Arabia Afghanistan and India so I mean it really had spread subsequent to the church declaring the Nicene Constantinople and Ephesian Creed's it began to settle down into formal religious acts that's that's documented history it started descending from the leadership of the Spirit into this is our form of worship this is how we do it now we have catechism you have to take a catechism class for two years before you can be baptized you you know all these different things that they'd set up that you can't find anywhere in Scripture now and the church grew to such a place that it was such a big organism that it became connected politically both in Rome and in Constantinople it was still being persecuted in other in other areas that we talked about but especially in what is modern-day Turkey in the the Middle East North Africa and Europe where it had spread - it was connected politically it began to spiritually die it started relying on its form and its connection to politics it formed layers of hierarchy it continued to formally formulate its own doctrines loosely based on Scripture but mostly based on the authority of the church fathers of history it descended to the point where people even theologians had never even seen a Bible in who imagined theologians trained in the in the by the Catholic in Eastern Orthodox churches didn't even have a Bible in their possession roughly 300 years later after Nicaea Muhammad began his Crusades and doctrines that directly opposed the Christian faith or we would say they for sure the Catholic faith but the Christian faith is in general as well as a result the territories where there were Christians diminished and receded mostly to the Byzantine Empire and Mediterranean Europe with a few spots here and there in northern and western Europe the fruits of Nicaea based upon history were spiritual death God cursed the world with Islam and as a result of that with the Dark Ages the world did not change at all it stayed the same in almost every way until the Bible began to be restored to its rightful place as the final authority of the church once that happened the world began to progress again and within a short period of time missionary started going out to all these lands that were teaching not Catholicism but a return back to the Bible and the different messages that the Lord began to restore through the Reformers throughout the ages so these these things are I guess simple to a message believer brother Branham sometimes summarizes them in just a few sentences but it's kind of wonderful to see at least for me to see kind of looking at the history in the big picture to see how you know exactly these things happen I mean it's not just a crazy statement that the church went the wrong way at Nicaea and went you know went swung over to Rome and went into false doctrine for sure there was a process leading up to that and then there was a process after that but it was a turning point for the church because deciding things through a Council of bishops became the norm and it by no means is a scriptural means of how God decides what his word means so we thank the Lord for a restored truth in this day and then so so glad that God sent this message to us and it brings that balanced scriptural truth it's not it's not a Trinity of three persons it's not a oneness Jesus only its bet its balance in the middle right in the scriptures amen let's stand and pray gracious father we love you we're thankful for this truth Lord we want to take everything the Prophet spoke Lord and we want to take every everything in the scriptures and not be ashamed and not feel like we have to run from everything Lord but just to be rejoicing and in a balanced word Lord we know we know and we've seen you manifested and displayed the Lord you've been unveiled before us made known before us in this our Lord not that we can know some doctrine and become good at arguing a point Lord but that we would know you because knowing you is life may we continue to grow into that word Lord may that life be expressed more and more may we surrender more and more to the life of Jesus Christ help us lord help us to be help help our eyes to be single lord help us help our hearts to be pure Lord cleanse us and cleanness Lord we commit ourselves to you we ask your blessing upon the worship and the preaching of the word today in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen god bless you
