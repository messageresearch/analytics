[26:02] 20 sorry we can't display it today amen
[26:05] we uh have the screen
[26:07] covered and it came to pass in those
[26:10] days that there went out a decree from
[26:12] Caesar Augustus that all the world
[26:15] should be taxed and this taxing was
[26:18] first made when serenius was governor of
[26:21] Syria and all went to be taxed everyone
[26:25] into his own City and Joseph also went
[26:28] up From Galilee out of the city of
[26:30] Nazareth into Judea unto the city of
[26:34] David which is called Bethlehem because
[26:36] he was of the house and lineage of David
[26:40] to be taxed with Mary his espoused wife
[26:43] being great with child and so it was
[26:47] that while they were there the days were
[26:49] accomplished that she should be
[26:51] delivered and she brought forth her
[26:53] firstborn son and wrapped him in
[26:55] swaddling clothes and laid him in in a
[26:58] Manger because there was no room for
[27:02] them in the
[27:04] end and there were in the same country
[27:07] shepherds abiding in the field keeping
[27:10] watch over their flock by night and lo
[27:13] the angel of the Lord Came Upon them and
[27:15] the glory of the Lord Shone round about
[27:18] them and they were sore afraid and the
[27:22] angel said unto them fear not for behold
[27:25] I bring you good tidings of great joy
[27:28] which shall be to all people for unto
[27:31] you is Born This Day in the city of
[27:34] David a savior which is Christ the lord
[27:38] and this shall be a sign unto you you
[27:40] shall find the Babe wrapped in swaddling
[27:42] clothes lying in a manger and suddenly
[27:46] there was with the angel a multitude of
[27:49] the Heavenly Host praising God and
[27:52] saying glory to God in the highest and
[27:55] on Earth peace good will toward men and
[28:00] it came to pass as the Angels were gone
[28:02] away from them into heaven the Shepherds
[28:05] said one to another let us now go even
[28:08] unto Bethlehem and see this thing which
[28:10] has come to pass which the Lord hath
[28:12] made known unto us and they came with
[28:15] haste and found Mary and Joseph and the
[28:17] Babe lying in a manger and when they had
[28:20] seen it they made known abroad the
[28:22] saying which was told them concerning
[28:24] this child and all they that heard it
[28:28] wondered at those things which were told
[28:30] them by the Shepherds but Mary kept all
[28:34] these things and pondered them in her
[28:36] heart and the Shepherds returned
[28:38] glorifying and praising God for all the
[28:41] things that they had heard and seen as
[28:45] it was told unto
[28:47] them amen I want to speak to you today
[28:50] on taking a title the day that changed
[28:53] it all amen let's pray
[28:58] father we thank you for your word today
[29:01] there's a blessing in reading your word
[29:03] there's a blessing in just hearing it R
[29:06] so we already have a double blessing
[29:09] Lord and now we're asking you to take
[29:12] the bread of life Lord and break it to
[29:14] us
[29:15] individually bring us a greater
[29:18] understanding of that great day that
[29:20] momentous day that changed it all Lord
[29:23] it it returned hope back it you finally
[29:27] were making a move Lord to redeem the
[29:30] whole world father I ask that you help
[29:33] us today to look upon this season Lord
[29:37] exactly for what it is and it only
[29:39] matters what what you say it is Lord it
[29:43] only matters what the the the whole
[29:46] Heavenly purpose behind this holiday
[29:49] season we know what the world has made
[29:52] it into Lord and we're we're not
[29:55] oblivious to that and we don't put our
[29:57] head in the sand but we struggle Lord
[30:01] against modern society to to keep it in
[30:04] remembrance as a sacred Time Lord so I
[30:07] pray you'll be our helper today teach us
[30:10] one and all in jesus' name amen God
[30:13] bless you friend you can be seated
[30:32] it was indeed a day that would change it
[30:36] all it would change everything it would
[30:39] it was the beginning of a of a new world
[30:42] order it was the beginning of a new
[30:44] Heavenly order it was the beginning it
[30:46] wasn't the you know the babe didn't come
[30:49] from a manger and go to Calvary they
[30:52] didn't sacrifice an infant there would
[30:55] be years of growth and the Bible talks
[30:58] about how that Jesus submitted himself
[31:01] unto the authority of his Earthly
[31:05] parents he the Bible tells us how that
[31:08] the child grew in wisdom and
[31:11] understanding the Bible tells us later
[31:13] on uh it became apparent to the
[31:17] disciples and they wrote it in the
[31:19] scriptures that he learned obedience by
[31:22] the things that he suffered and suffer
[31:26] he did but it changed everything it
[31:29] meant now that there could be a a way
[31:32] for God to to Jesus was the Keystone as
[31:36] brother Brandon would call him between
[31:38] the Old Testament and the New Testament
[31:41] these two eras of of humanity these two
[31:45] epochs of humanity how that God dwelt
[31:49] above his family but you know the reason
[31:53] that that was never going to be
[31:56] sustained was because he was he didn't
[32:00] start that way in the Garden of Eden he
[32:03] walked with them and fellowshipped with
[32:05] them and they lived in his realm and he
[32:09] lived in their realm they were even Adam
[32:12] was even an amateure god brother Brenham
[32:15] tells us how that
[32:17] God you know rules the universe and he
[32:20] did not create the Earth for himself to
[32:23] rule he rules it uh by proxy he rules it
[32:27] uh through his children he made it for
[32:30] man to rule and so we realize that the
[32:34] fall separated God and and brother
[32:37] brandham has very amazing language how
[32:39] that it it separated God from his
[32:42] purpose and and and but but he was
[32:45] always going to bring it back that was
[32:48] always going to be Redemption there was
[32:50] always going to be this child born long
[32:53] before Isaiah ever said it he was always
[32:55] going to be born I all the way back to
[32:58] Abel all the way back to the Tree of
[33:00] Life in the midst of the Garden of Eden
[33:03] uh it was all the way back to to Genesis
[33:06] 1 where there in verses 27 and 28 he
[33:10] starts talking about be fruitful and
[33:12] multiply and replenish the Earth and
[33:14] brother brandham shows us and teaches us
[33:17] how that there in the spoken word is
[33:19] Original Seed series how that there was
[33:22] there would the only way for something
[33:24] to multiply would mean that something
[33:26] had to die so even in Genesis before the
[33:30] fall he's already embedding in a in in a
[33:34] in an encrypted way he's already
[33:37] embedding the the truth that there's
[33:40] going to be a death a burial a
[33:43] resurrection there's going to be a
[33:45] Redemption there's going to be a
[33:46] redeemer and that means there's going to
[33:48] have to be a loss amen so we find that
[33:52] the Garden of Eden and what happened
[33:54] there was not Satan catching God unaware
[33:58] it wasn't a sucker punch it wasn't God
[34:00] knew the whole thing was coming his
[34:02] birth was not an accident his life was
[34:05] not an accident his death was not an
[34:07] accident his resurrection was certainly
[34:09] not an accident it wasn't just God
[34:12] fixing a problem it was always part of
[34:15] the
[34:16] plan it wasn't God saying well now
[34:19] they've they've killed Christ so I'm
[34:20] going to raise him back from the dead
[34:22] I'll fix it I'll show them but it was
[34:25] always a part of the plan for him to die
[34:28] to be buried to be resurrected if for no
[34:31] other reason then someday you would go
[34:33] to the water and be buried beneath the
[34:36] water in his name and rise up
[34:38] identifying with his
[34:39] resurrection his life would come back
[34:41] into the church so he wouldn't just be
[34:43] God above and not only just God with
[34:46] which made it all possible but he would
[34:49] be God in the the the family of God
[34:52] would be redeemed and now here we have
[34:55] been spending 2,000 years
[34:58] in a new testament era 2,000 years where
[35:02] God has been filling the role of those
[35:05] names that were recorded in the Lamb's
[35:07] Book of Life before the foundation of
[35:09] the world they're all known of God
[35:12] they're all they all must be born again
[35:15] but they all will be born again they
[35:18] must be part of the first resurrection
[35:20] and they will be part of the first
[35:23] resurrection and there's nothing that
[35:25] you can do to separate your self from
[35:28] that love that was in Christ Jesus that
[35:31] knew you before the Earth even
[35:36] existed there's a colloquial term called
[35:39] EB and flow it's an
[35:41] expression that's been used for many
[35:44] many hundreds of years and it refers to
[35:46] the Natural rise and fall or the
[35:50] fluctuation of something over time it
[35:54] originated from the movement of the
[35:56] ocean tide Zeb meaning the the tide
[35:58] going out receding and flow meaning the
[36:00] tide coming in or
[36:02] Rising its literal origin in its literal
[36:06] origin it describes the rhythmic
[36:08] movement of Tides symbolizing
[36:11] consistent catch this consistent yet
[36:15] opposing forces so it's it it it moves
[36:20] out it comes back in it moves out it
[36:23] comes back in and there's a power and
[36:25] the Moon is involved in that call and
[36:28] brother bam shows us how that if the if
[36:31] God didn't bring the moon back around to
[36:34] to look at the ocean then he said the
[36:37] the incoming tide would just cover the
[36:39] Earth again but God set laws in the
[36:42] heavens and nature flows es and flows
[36:47] according to the laws that God set in
[36:49] motion even broken it still tries to
[36:52] worship him even broken nature still
[36:55] rejoices at God the son Rises and
[36:58] declares his glory to the whole world
[37:00] every day the leaves clap their hands
[37:04] and the birds sing Oh friends even even
[37:07] in a broken World nature knows who made
[37:14] it in a figurative meaning e and flow is
[37:17] often used to describe Cycles or
[37:20] patterns and changes that are not not
[37:23] always consistent but they occur
[37:25] regularly or they occur
[37:28] naturally there is as we would be
[37:31] familiar with the EB and flow of Rel in
[37:34] relationships the EB and flow of a
[37:37] friendship would then refer to how
[37:40] closeness and then distance might
[37:43] naturally alternate over time in
[37:47] business the market experiences an EB
[37:49] and flow it describes times of decline
[37:52] it Des it describes times of growth uh
[37:56] life events the EB and flow we have an
[37:59] EB and flow of emotions and this refers
[38:03] to a lot of times how feelings can
[38:06] intensify and then diminish and it's
[38:09] natural that's not unnatural for that to
[38:12] happen this is exactly why that you when
[38:16] you you know and this is not in my notes
[38:19] this one's free today this is why young
[38:22] men and young women should find thus
[38:24] sayith the Lord for their Eternal mate
[38:26] because and flow will rise and diminish
[38:29] that affection you feel but true Oneness
[38:32] true eternal love is never ending
[38:36] because that's not from this broken
[38:38] realm that's from that realm living out
[38:41] down
[38:45] here so it highlights a rhythm it
[38:48] highlights um a a balance between
[38:52] opposing States and and suggesting that
[38:56] if I'd say say it like this and and some
[38:59] people really don't like like this
[39:01] reality but it's true we face it every
[39:03] day change is inevitable
[39:08] amen but here's what you want to realize
[39:12] in
[39:13] change that it's part of a larger
[39:18] pattern there really are especially I
[39:21] can say this now because a prophet said
[39:24] concerning God's family there are no
[39:26] accidents amen the footsteps of the
[39:29] righteous are ordered over the Lord and
[39:31] I cannot explain to
[39:34] you why your life before Christ went the
[39:37] direction is sometimes we look for
[39:40] answers that are on the other side and
[39:41] we won't get them till we get there I
[39:43] don't know why things turned out maybe
[39:45] you made choices maybe we'll find out
[39:48] we'll understand it better by and by but
[39:49] I know this God always knew where you
[39:52] were he knew when he was going to find
[39:54] you he knew how to how to pull it off
[39:56] and you had no
[39:59] chance to get
[40:01] away thank
[40:04] god brother
[40:06] brandham
[40:08] called eban Flo as we're describing it
[40:12] brother brandham called it the law of
[40:15] contrast that we live
[40:18] by there cannot be the level of
[40:22] enjoyment that we have of a of a bright
[40:25] sunny day without a rainy day we we get
[40:29] that we get that right now see and so
[40:33] you know you cannot fully enjoy good
[40:36] health without experiencing the contrast
[40:39] of illness you say well I just like to
[40:41] be well all the time someday you will
[40:44] you know and I don't know how this is
[40:45] going to work I'll admit to you today
[40:47] I've thought a lot about this over the
[40:50] years will this law of contrast because
[40:53] in heaven I'm not going to need that law
[40:56] of contrast I'm not going to need to be
[40:58] sick to appreciate being well I'm not
[40:59] going to need a rainy day to appreciate
[41:01] a sunny day I'm not going to need the
[41:04] devil to appreciate
[41:06] Christ I'm going to live in a world
[41:08] where the devil doesn't exist where
[41:10] rainy days and Gloom do not exist I'm
[41:13] going to live in a world where all is
[41:15] peace forever more on that happy Golden
[41:22] Shore there is no
[41:25] character apart from suffering ing
[41:29] amen we know and we talk often about the
[41:32] suffering of the
[41:35] Cross but today you're going to see a
[41:38] depiction that there was suffering
[41:41] before the
[41:43] cross brother Brandon would say teach us
[41:46] that there's no character apart from
[41:47] suffering in the seven Church ages book
[41:50] he says it this way his purpose is that
[41:54] after we have suffered a while we would
[41:57] would be made perfect you in amen you
[42:00] want to be made perfect how many's in
[42:02] say I'm all in if it means I can be
[42:05] perfect Count Me In sign me up am
[42:10] amen that after a while we would be made
[42:12] perfect be established strengthened and
[42:15] settled Grant it Lord Jesus as job said
[42:21] he puts strength in us there in job 23
[42:25] you see he him himself
[42:29] suffered he learned obedience by the
[42:33] things that he suffered he was
[42:36] actually made
[42:38] perfect by the things that he
[42:42] suffered now Jesus didn't need to be
[42:45] born again but Jesus needed to live
[42:48] under the law of contrast so that he
[42:50] could be a faithful high priest when you
[42:52] have to live under it and he was tempted
[42:54] and suffered in all wise as we could
[42:56] ever tempted and suffered I want you to
[42:58] know you have a faithful high
[43:03] priest it was made perfect by the things
[43:06] that he suffered Hebrews 5:8-9 though he
[43:08] were a son yet learned he obedience by
[43:10] the things which he suffered and being
[43:13] made perfect he became the author of
[43:14] Eternal salvation unto all them that
[43:16] obey him in plain language the very
[43:20] character of Jesus was perfected by
[43:23] suffering all right now you ready for
[43:26] some you ready for a change you ready
[43:28] for some EB and flow
[43:30] amen and according to Paul he has left
[43:35] his church a measure of suffering that
[43:39] they too by their faith in God while
[43:43] suffering for him would come to a place
[43:47] of
[43:49] perfection how many's all
[43:51] in I'm not praying for trials I'm not
[43:55] recommending you pray for trials but I
[43:57] know this I want to have faith in him
[44:00] while I'm suffering but and let me know
[44:02] that it's going to be for my
[44:08] perfection we we often sing the song
[44:12] Silent Night and it's a very beautiful
[44:14] song it's very old song was written many
[44:17] years
[44:18] ago and it's a very beautiful song and
[44:21] and I don't have any clue it might be in
[44:23] the in the program for today I hav't a
[44:26] clue I don't know
[44:28] but I do know that one of the songs
[44:30] that's going to be
[44:32] sung and the children are going to act
[44:36] this portion Out Sister Deborah has some
[44:38] other things with this I'm not going to
[44:40] get into all of that uh I'll let you be
[44:43] um surprised and amazed as it
[44:47] happens but I want you to think about
[44:50] the lyrics that brother Steve and sister
[44:53] Emily are going to sing as part of the
[44:56] program and they her song interconnects
[44:59] with the program and you'll understand
[45:00] all of that as it
[45:03] goes the song is
[45:06] titled it was
[45:08] not a silent
[45:12] night it was not a silent
[45:15] night there was blood on the
[45:19] ground you could hear a woman cry in the
[45:23] alleyway that night on the streets of
[45:26] David's town
[45:27] down and the stable was not
[45:32] clean and the
[45:34] cobblestones were
[45:37] cold little Mary full of
[45:41] Faith with tears upon her face had no
[45:45] Mother's hand to
[45:47] hold it was a labor of
[45:50] pain it was a cold sky
[45:54] above but for the girl on the ground in
[45:57] the dark Every Beat of her beautiful
[46:00] heart was a labor of
[46:05] love Noble Joseph by her
[46:08] side calloused hands and weary
[46:12] eyes there were no midwives to be found
[46:16] in the streets of David's town in the
[46:19] middle of the
[46:21] night so he held her and he
[46:25] prayed shafts of Moonlight on his
[46:29] face but the baby in the
[46:32] womb he was the maker of the
[46:36] Moon he was the author of faith that
[46:40] could make the mountains move oh it was
[46:43] a labor of pain it was a cold sky
[46:48] above but for the but for the girl on
[46:52] the ground in the dark Every Beat of her
[46:55] beautiful heart
[46:57] it was a labor of
[46:59] love little Mary full of Faith with
[47:03] tears upon her face was a labor of
[47:09] love it was not a Silent
[47:12] Night on the streets of David's
[47:17] Town brother brandham says in God's
[47:21] gifts always find their places December
[47:24] the 22nd 1963
[47:27] today's actual date all those years
[47:32] ago he says we realize over here in St
[47:36] John 12 you remember this is where she
[47:38] came with the alabaster to anoint him
[47:40] for his
[47:41] burial St John 12 we find out that this
[47:45] woman brought this myrr that anointed
[47:47] costly something to make the smell of
[47:50] death away and she broke this Alabaster
[47:53] Box and poured it upon the head of Jesus
[47:56] and Judas said
[47:57] why this ought to have been given to the
[48:00] poor said not that he had respect for
[48:02] the poor but he was a thief to begin
[48:04] with he carried the money and said this
[48:06] ought to have been sold instead have put
[48:08] it and Jesus said let her
[48:11] alone for she did this she anointed him
[48:15] unto his burial you know this woman
[48:19] whether it was this woman whether it was
[48:22] Mary whether it was the bride like Mary
[48:24] who says be it unto me according to Thy
[48:27] word he has left us a measure of
[48:29] suffering he's Desiring he suffered and
[48:32] we suffer but together we have a new
[48:34] world coming friends and that more that
[48:37] that night when Angels sang changed
[48:41] everything for the
[48:46] world Jesus said let her alone for she
[48:49] did this she anointed him un his burial
[48:51] this woman so grateful so grateful that
[48:56] her s sins were
[48:58] forgiven oh my when I when I pasted that
[49:03] quote into my
[49:05] notes the AI writing tool didn't know
[49:08] what to do with
[49:09] it it had all kinds of suggestion but
[49:12] when it got to the to the term were
[49:14] forgiven her sins were forgiven and it
[49:17] had it underlined and so I said what
[49:19] would it want to change and I clicked on
[49:21] it and said no
[49:24] suggestions oh my my sins were forgiven
[49:28] and nobody can understand it even I
[49:30] can't understand it but there's one who
[49:32] understands why he did it
[49:36] Allelujah he said she was so grateful
[49:38] that her sins were
[49:40] forgiven until she spent all of her
[49:43] money she had and took an alabaster box
[49:47] broke it and poured the oil and just
[49:48] odored the room with fine smell of this
[49:50] myrr that she had anointed him for his
[49:53] death now see she did the service not
[49:57] knowing what she was doing how many can
[49:59] relate to that sometimes you just feel
[50:02] compelled by the Holy
[50:04] Spirit she didn't know what she was
[50:06] doing but she was so grateful to God and
[50:11] if you're so grateful for
[50:14] Christmas
[50:16] see we're grateful we're here today
[50:18] we're excited this is a wonderful day
[50:20] Christmas is coming it's a joyous
[50:23] time if you're so grateful for Christmas
[50:27] it's not to say I give Jones's a gift
[50:31] and they give me one back I'll see what
[50:33] I got in the morning why don't you open
[50:36] up your heart and see what's in there
[50:42] amen find out what's you got in here and
[50:47] except if you if we find it empty with
[50:50] just negative Creeds and cares of the
[50:53] world why not ask Christ to fill it
[50:57] tonight
[50:58] amen tonight see I'd say to you
[51:02] today tonight today so that you can ask
[51:07] Christ to fill it so that you can get
[51:11] the real meaning of Christmas amen here
[51:15] it is it's Christ in you God dwelling in
[51:22] the human heart that's what the real
[51:26] Christmas
[51:31] Means brother brandom goes on but you
[51:33] see
[51:35] today we become so negative now when I
[51:40] when I read that I my human sense
[51:43] thought you know this seems inside
[51:46] out that we make it so negative I mean
[51:49] because we make Christmas a festive time
[51:52] of
[51:53] joy and a prophet is it seems inside out
[51:56] what he's saying like it's upside down
[51:59] we make it so negative why would he call
[52:03] it negative we make it a festive time of
[52:06] family and friends and food and gifts
[52:08] and joy and and people greet you and
[52:10] everybody's in a friendly Mo uh mood and
[52:13] why would he call it negative you know
[52:16] can I just say it like this and and and
[52:19] I just speak to you from my heart today
[52:22] brother brandham was not an unfeeling
[52:25] manen amen he was a Man Who Loved people
[52:29] and dedicated his entire life to the
[52:31] service of
[52:33] humanity he had a soft spot for little
[52:36] children he had been a child once and
[52:39] you know as he grew up he tells about
[52:41] how that nobody wanted to have anything
[52:43] to do with him his his family uh had a
[52:47] bad name in the hills and Backwoods of
[52:51] Kentucky so we don't judge him as a man
[52:56] when would say Christmas is for children
[52:59] yeah it's for the kitties sister Rebecca
[53:02] wrote in her only believe magazine she
[53:05] said the the last time he made that
[53:08] statement before his death he came in to
[53:11] the house and he had went out and had a
[53:13] little tree and some little decorations
[53:15] and he said we've got to have this for
[53:17] the kitties and she said the kitties
[53:19] Joseph 10 Sarah 14 and me
[53:22] 18 amen amen for the kitty
[53:31] so we don't judge him as a man when he
[53:34] said Christmas is for children can I say
[53:37] to you today that he didn't stop being a
[53:39] prophet when he handed out presents to
[53:41] his family from under a decorated tree
[53:44] amen that's
[53:46] right that's a Bonafide fact and he
[53:48] didn't stop being a prophet when he did
[53:50] it amen sister Jean has personally seen
[53:53] the family films of that
[53:58] it's for children only that we tell them
[54:01] the truth about Santa otherwise brother
[54:03] brandham said if you don't tell them the
[54:05] truth about Santa they may grow up and
[54:08] when they discover Santa to be false
[54:11] they may say well what about this Jesus
[54:14] that's right is he false too
[54:17] amen we struggle as I've already said we
[54:20] struggle against modern society to
[54:23] remember that it is a sacred day
[54:27] we freely join in the Glorious news I
[54:31] bring you good tidings of great joy
[54:35] which shall be to all people for unto
[54:37] you is born a savior we rejoice in that
[54:40] a multitude of heavenly host praising
[54:43] God and saying glory to God in the
[54:45] highest and on Earth peace Good Will
[54:48] toward men the world celebrates the
[54:51] birth of the Savior to a degree I
[54:53] suppose it's getting less and less
[54:56] but there are still some mangor scenes
[54:59] on The Lawns of scattered churches here
[55:01] and there and occasionally you'll see a
[55:03] mangor scene on on the somebody's front
[55:06] yard I remember brother Donnie years ago
[55:09] he said you know he said uh he would he
[55:11] read a quote where brother brandham
[55:13] talks about how that that at the end
[55:16] time Christ is making himself fully I'm
[55:18] not quoting it exactly but Christ is
[55:20] revealing himself fully in a bride and
[55:24] and brother Donnie said they're all out
[55:25] there looking looking at a Manger at a
[55:27] baby he said I think he said I told
[55:29] Carol I'm going to go out to that manger
[55:30] and lay down in
[55:38] it but even with
[55:40] that even with the occasional manger
[55:43] scene that we
[55:45] see the real meaning the real meaning of
[55:50] Christmas has been covered over and
[55:53] hidden and it would take a prophit I
[55:56] suggest you today it would take a
[55:58] prophet with enough courage to brush
[56:01] aside all the man-made debris and
[56:04] uncover the original plan of God for the
[56:08] birth of Christ but you see today we we
[56:12] become so negative he says the devil
[56:16] getting us through there there's there's
[56:18] painted candy sticks and a reindeer and
[56:20] a whiskered man that flies through the
[56:23] air like an airplane and visits the
[56:25] whole world and every home with a little
[56:27] bundle of toys on his back and visits
[56:29] every child and it's just a
[56:33] lie it's just right out a lie amen but
[56:39] why fair question but
[56:43] why the devil did that so he could twist
[56:47] the minds of
[56:49] people can you imagine that Jesus who

[1:21:00] [Music]
[1:21:06] So This Time of the Season as we focus
[1:21:10] our thinking towards Christmas it's too
[1:21:14] bad that we have to lot it to a myth
[1:21:18] called Santa Claus and the stead of the
[1:21:21] real Christmas as it's supposed to be
[1:21:25] many little children in the land today
[1:21:27] know nothing more than Christmas Means A
[1:21:30] Sligh full of toys and some Mystic
[1:21:33] reindeers pouncing on the house to only
[1:21:37] learn later of this myth to even hurt
[1:21:41] their faith when it comes to know the
[1:21:44] true Christmas story that it had nothing
[1:21:47] to do with reindeers or a man smoking a
[1:21:50] pipe with fur around his coat it was the
[1:21:53] birth of our blessed Lord Jesus and it's
[1:21:57] most unusual to see how God worked in
[1:22:01] this manner because no other time would
[1:22:04] have ever worked in all the history of
[1:22:08] the world it had to be just exactly at
[1:22:12] this time and now for a few moments
[1:22:15] let's just look right at the
[1:22:18] seasons it was a time that when Herod
[1:22:21] the murder was King
[1:22:25] it had to be this heartless man had to
[1:22:28] be king at the time for we're acquainted
[1:22:31] with the scriptures that said he slew
[1:22:33] all the children from 2y old down trying
[1:22:36] to find the Christ and then there had to
[1:22:39] be at the time that there had to raise a
[1:22:44] taxation to cause Mary and Joseph to go
[1:22:48] back to their hometown of Bethlehem
[1:22:51] where they were registered and their
[1:22:53] births was on the record of the courts
[1:22:57] and in the temple to be
[1:23:00] taxed and Christ was to be born in
[1:23:03] Bethlehem and they were many miles away
[1:23:07] when this took
[1:23:09] place and we been notice at The Perils
[1:23:13] they had to go through in order to get
[1:23:16] there now they didn't have a great fine
[1:23:20] plush ambulance to take Mary up there no
[1:23:25] comfort for the little expecting
[1:23:27] mother and no way of travel only by foot
[1:23:31] or on the back of a little donkey and if
[1:23:34] anyone ever rode a donkey knows what a
[1:23:37] rough ride that is the little fella
[1:23:40] along a narrow trail that wind up over
[1:23:44] the mountains coming to Bethlehem from
[1:23:46] lower Judea very rough and rugged Road
[1:23:52] what if the little donkey would not not
[1:23:54] have been
[1:23:55] surefooted and would have fell with this
[1:23:57] little expecting
[1:24:00] mother or in the days when there was so
[1:24:03] much travel coming into their homelands
[1:24:06] the whole country was working alive with
[1:24:10] pilgrims and travelers back to the
[1:24:13] Homeland a very good setup for robbers
[1:24:17] in those days when they seen the little
[1:24:19] Caravans of small peoples the Riders are
[1:24:24] robbers could have rode right in and
[1:24:26] slew them and tucked their goods and
[1:24:29] went off also what if some of the wild
[1:24:34] beasts which there was lions and many
[1:24:38] destroying wild animals that roamed in
[1:24:41] the deserts that they had to cross what
[1:24:44] if a wild beast would have tucked
[1:24:48] towards the little party what could
[1:24:50] Joseph have done with a stick in his
[1:24:53] hand and a wife that could hardly move
[1:24:57] what a thing it was to this young
[1:24:59] married couple that they had to face and
[1:25:04] how it would have
[1:25:06] been but it gives us consolation to know
[1:25:12] this that we do not hold our
[1:25:16] destiny god holds our
[1:25:20] destiny and he has ordained it to be so
[1:25:24] oh and there's nothing will ever
[1:25:26] interrupt the program of God Amen we are
[1:25:30] bound to
[1:25:32] rise and there were to be no fear and
[1:25:35] yet maybe Mary and Joseph themselves
[1:25:38] just common people not
[1:25:43] educated and they didn't have the way of
[1:25:46] knowing these things that were taking
[1:25:49] place right at that time was fulfilling
[1:25:51] the scriptures
[1:25:54] and it's the same
[1:25:56] today that things are taking place right
[1:25:59] in this day that we live in and many of
[1:26:03] us know nothing about it how God is
[1:26:08] moving
[1:26:48] that's
