TRANSCRIPT
========================================
e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e you know full of all kinds of sin and ungodliness and so you know we we think you know we we recognize that you know the seems like the world's coming to an end you know it seems like the we're in the last days and we so we take SC like that and we we apply that to where we are now and we look to see well does what Paul said about what the last days would be apply to where we're at right now or where we're headed and I but I I had this this this quote here um this is from like I said spoken words Original Seed and it says there's this question that brother bram's trying to answer and he says why then has the re Revival fires let up don't hear very much more more of Billy Graham like great evangelists Oral Roberts not burning the country like he used to my meetings is not even heard of they're just three there's just three what's the matter I'm going to be kind of skipping through this in the in the interest of time so if you ever pull this up it's not going to read exactly the way I read it just because I'm going to be skipping a lot um to kind of get to the meat of what I'm trying to get at um it says uh now Billy Graham the world was burning here not long ago with Billy Graham very seldom hear of it now he's still going but what's the matter Oral Roberts why just burning the Earth up dying down Tommy Osborne all them are good Godly men what's happening believing that God called me for a Ministry what's happening to mine now here's going to answer some questions what's happened you say brother brandom yours is deadest of deadest of all of them that's true that is right Billy Graham is more heard of than I am and Billy is more heard of than oral oral is more H is more heard of in one day than I am in six months Tommy Osborne Tommy Hicks any of those Godly men they're more heard of so as far as that turn mine is further away than all of them what's happened brother brandham you're saying uh saying that that you tell us here and now that you actually believe the word and everything well what's happened to you then what's taking place that's what we we want to know so here he is you know and often times you know we this as message people a lot of times we get into this mentality of well where's the constant Revival meetings where's you know we had back in the day under in the 50 you know 40s 50s and into the 60s you had huge tent revivals and and and it seems like the world was swept with this fervency for religion and for Christianity back then but you don't see it as much anymore more right it's kind of fallen off people have gotten more secular you know and you see this and it's not just like you know it's not like people in message churches think this this is just typical Across America across the religious people of of the world in general um people recognize that the the 40s and 50s America was a lot more of a religious Nation right America was very religious it was not as crazy and uncommon for people to go to Tent Revival and to have Revival meetings and things I mean you if you got a A you know saw an advertisement for a tent meeting Revival in your town these days you'd be shocked you never hear of it you know but you know when something like that happens now it's national news back then it wasn't such a big deal like they were happening all over the country all the time a lot of different different people were doing this and that just kind of fell away and it wasn't like it wasn't like these meetings were just sort of there was nothing to them I mean again the our teaching on this is pretty clear that these these revivals had real signs and wonders associated with it you know William Brandon was not the only Ministry that had signs and wonders associated with them Oral Roberts and Billy Graham did too right they absolutely there was a lot of of um Power and and outpouring of the gifts of the Spirit that went along with these revivals that swept world that's why they had the the draw and the appeal that they had but then it just kind of fell away it just kind of died down and so leaves us wondering why why don't we see that anymore should we be expecting to see that right is that something that we should be we should be looking for and um now he says later on he says um that's what's the matter with it the seeds has been planted he said said I wish you could see what's passed passed before sorry passed before me then the seeds has been planted remember there's a planting time than a harvest time um now there has been three different kinds of seeds planted a denominational Billy Graham he was the head planter Oral Roberts for the Pentecostals Pentecostal seed has been planted I'm talking about organization now and then the word has been planted now you'll have to understand understand folks I ain't saying this is no this no more unless God tells me I want you to get this good and clear three seeds has been planted that's the reason the planting it's about over okay and then he starts talking about picks up Joel where Joel's talking about in The Book of Joel he start talking about the former and the latter rain and for the interest of time because this is going to this would just take all the time what we have if I try to read all this but I'm going to try sumarize a lot of it but he goes down he starts doing a lot of commentary about um The Book of Joel chapter 2 and verse 23 where he's talking about the former and latter Reign and what he's he's using this as a type to say listen my Ministry or Roberts and Billy Graham we are all on the Earth right now to do to to teach to put word into the ground right to plant seeds and right now there is an outpouring of the spirit that's creating all this revival amen right that is to water the crop because the way in the in the Hebrew type they plant their their crops in the fall because immediately after that you know they they time it right so as soon as they plant their seeds they get fall rains every year and that fall rain Waters their crop this is known as in here he calls it the Mora rain that's what it says in the Bible if you look at the original word there it's the moral rain which is also translated as the former rain also translated as the teaching rain it is there to allow the crop that they just planted to sprout and gain life and then you have a latter rain and that latter rain is what happens right before the Harvest that finishes the maturing of the of the crop okay and so this is you know when when the Bible or you hear anyone referencing former and latter rain that's what they're talking about you have a something that happens in your life to sort of sprout the word to life in your heart and then you have a finishing th outpouring of the spirit that brings to maturity now um so he he's talking about you know and so he's referencing that all these revivals that you had in the 40s and 50s this is all under a former Reign you know in the in that in that cycle right that you have all these people coming in to plant seed and then the spirit of God falling on it and creating all the Revival and that's new life that's sprouting up right now and this is something else I I just want to interject here anytime you're talking about this sort of thing um where you you know I best example I ever heard of this was actually um brother Ben seabolt who preached about the four horsemen and you know across the church ages and he says anytime you have a a a um well put it like this we know that in in the Bible God deals with Israel as a nation and he deals with the Gentiles as individuals right but then you can look at the Gentile church as a whole across seven Church ages and you can see certain things applied to the whole seven Church ages but you can also take all of that and and narrowly focus it down onto an individual person's life right you can watch The Four Horsemen when somebody is falling away from the word you can watch The Four Horsemen ride through the life yeah right you can see the type of the former and latter Reign operate in a Christian's life right you come to you come to the word you come to Christ that you get this burst of Revival life that you suddenly everything's wonderful everything's new everything's sprouting you have all this fresh life but then what happens is that former reign will end and now you have to grow and mature and it's you're not going to be getting the outpouring of the spirit every day like you used to right and now it's just going to take a lot of growing and maturing but at the end you're once you come into maturity then there's a fresh outpouring of spirit to bring you to that that ultimate final maturity so um so but also you can apply this on an individual Church age so you can take so here's brother Bram talking about in this church age you have a form of rain that's planted or that's that's comes down under a planting time brings uh a fr fresh like a a a Revival and um uh let's see here yeah so I want to I want to pick this up so it says now just wait a minute you take the word from Joel chapter 2 and look at it and see if the Hebrew word you go to the Hebrew and see if if it doesn't if you want to write it down m o u r e h Mora and get the Hebrew word interpret see what Mora means teaching the teaching Reign has went forth the denominational teaching Reign has went forth a million more in 44 Baptists and so and so members of the church Oral Roberts and them brothers with the Pentecostal move the great Pentecostal move they moved up into the millions that's right and the seed has went forth the word for the minority the group now watch now remember the word Mora Mora means teaching the former Reign it says the rain the teaching rain teaching rain went forth Billy Graham has struck the world the Pentecostals struck the world and the word has struck the world now what's the matter now she is now waiting for the latter rain amen that's when she produces her fruits I hope you get it when the kind of seed you have planted in your field will be the kind of crop you will reap if the denominations want more members that's what they're going to get yeah that's what they have gotten the Pentecostals want more Pentecostals that's what they're going to get but the word is going to produce Sons and Daughters of God Amen that's coming too watch look at that great latter rain supposed to be done now they would run over the wall leap over and how they'd be an AR uh Army coming just wait a minute the kind of crop you'll get is the kind of seed you put in your field two denominational kinds you understand the two denominational kinds will unite together to go to Sodom but the word will stay with the elected the Royal seed Jesus said as it was in the days of Sodom so it will be the coming of the son of man now he says and what they're trying to do um they're trying to manufacture a latter rain um why the latter rain will sweep the world Ben a former rain sewing words that's right now you'll see what the latter rain produces you'll find out there'll be an a ilation the Pentecostals and all the groups will come together and they'll shut the doors on them guys that won't listen to it you won't even be allowed to open your mouth that's when he'll come that's when he'll show that's when you'll see a rain okay so so often times this is just when I I I've said all of this has all kind of been backgrounded to say kind of make this point so often times we as Christians and as as and The Wider Christ sort of nominal Christian world everybody kind of looks at the world and recognizes that there is the world is full of you know uh you know as we read in in second Timothy you know lovers of their own selves Covetous boasters proud Blasphemous disobedient to parents all these things we can look at the world and say okay we see all this corruption in the world this is clearly evil and wrong and and and and whatnot and there's a there's a a a tendency for people to look at the worst side of that and see that as sort of like well this is a sign of the end and in some sense you were you're you're right right to do that but don't forget that in the middle of all this in the list of all this wickedness he includes people having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof okay a form of godliness that they don't have a form of wokeness right right you know you see in the in the wider Christian world people are so focused in on on um sort of like the trans agenda or the gay agenda or the woke agenda however you want to phrase that we're so terrified of what this these different political movements are that they're starting to unite to combat it yeah right which on a from a purely mological sense you would think that's the right thing to do right and after all the Bible says that you know that it would be as in the days of Sodom so clearly wokeism has to take over the world does it right because if you study this at all you study the history of where a lot of this ideology came from and this isn't like some crackpot Theory it's just communism amen that's all it is it's just a communist a re a rehashing of Communism but using social acceptance as as a standin for economics and you know we know there's no scripture that communism is going to take over the world Amen it's not there right am the Antichrist is not going to come to the world preach ing a a message of of rainbow Flags it's not going to happen it it will look so close that it'll deceive the elect if it were possible it'll look just like the real deal right the fact of the matter is what people need to be on the lookout for is a Revival when you see the world suddenly get very very religious that's when you start raising your eyebrows because the reality is communism is a tool in the hand of God like Nebuchadnezzar was a tool in the hand of God to gather all the the the people at the end time right amen the wokeism is the rope with which God will bind the tears right it is how he will gather them together because they will all start running in the same direction right if you're if everyone's surrounded by by this crazy agenda they all start running together right and they will absolutely unite to fight it but and if you don't if you don't buy into it and you say well I'm not going to be part of that well then you'll be the outcast well you just must be one of them right but and what'll be so deceptive about it is you will see signs and wonders because again it'll be just like Oral Roberts and Billy Graham what went into the ground in the 1950s will come out at the end the seed that went in to the ground that's the point of a harvest you get more of what you put into the ground at the end so what they planted under a under a teaching reign in the 1950s is what they'll get at the end it will have Revival meetings and Holiness standard and it'll be maybe more of a Holiness standard than you have at least a stricter one right it'll look just like the real thing it'll walk talk sound just like the real deal right it'll be so close it'll even have signs and wonders associated with it right it'll have Miracles and it'll be so hard to say well that's not real Christianity the only way that you'll know the only way that you'll know is that at the end of the day they have a very good form of godliness but completely deny the power of that godliness they they don't have any actual genuine power I just want to say this this to my to to finish I'm kind of out of time and this is my the Crux of everything I want to say we know that um if you can pull up um uh Romans chapter 8 verse one for me um the the the the form of godliness right it'll be people who who will be able to show through the scripture how Holiness is a a lifestyle of not conforming to Holiness is against the word of God they will be able to show clearly through the scripture how various you know sinful lifestyles are against the word of God they will be able to show all of this but they will have no ability no path to changing the sinful nature that calls for it right that's the power of God that they will deny right it will be it'll be a good front it'll be a good facade they'll have a very nice face on it right it'll it'll look just like a Christian lifestyle but there's no internal change of the heart amen there's always a desire and a longing for that thing they'll clearly be able to show how you know uh uh uh uh you know some some ungodly lifestyle is against the word of God but they'll offer No Redemption to change it amen they'll offer no real pathway other than just simply I don't know do better just just willpower and that'll fail it'll never work there's no internal change of the nature right no internal change of the heart no desire change and so what they end up with is they have a letter of the law yeah with no and the letter kth right the letter kth there's it's the spirit that bringeth life amen so often times I I just want to look at the scripture here it says there's there for no now there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit so many times people get caught up especially especially new Christians get caught up in lose the the ability to see the difference between condemnation and conviction yeah okay the word of God will convict you it will never condemn you okay the letter of the law a legalistic list of dos and don'ts will convi will convict you every time or condemn you I'm sorry every time and you're think what's the difference why is this important like what's the difference between the those two those two words very simply put like this if a man does something wrong right you do you do commit some sin worthy of death okay and you go before the judge and you are found guilty you are convicted of the crime you have been declared guilty when the sentence is passed and the judge s says you know I sentence you to hang by the neck until dead that is condemnation you are condemned to die right conviction is a statement of guilt and wrongdoing condemnation is a statement of how you're going to end up right it's a statement of of of penalty yeah right the word will will convict you it will let it will make you fully aware that you did wrong and that you need to that you you were wrong the law will send you to hell right but there's a the different like there's a window in there between you know when the man is sitting in the in the jail cell looking out Between the Bars watching him build the Gallows he's been convicted of the crime and he's waiting for his the condemnation right he's watching him you know tie the news but in that window There's an opportunity for a pardon and that's why because of because of redemption that's why we can have no condemnation you can come under conviction every day but it doesn't matter because there's there's a there's an advocate pardoning everything that you do right there's an you have an advocate with the father who's bringing but it it is a it is entirely dependent on on people's willingness to admit guilt yeah and admit their fault and come subject to the word and what is what is um what's coming for the in the end time what what is going to trip people up and what is going to be the snare is that it is going to be a a word a a me a a a a false gospel preached that as long as you can live a legalistic standard you will make it and there will be no change of the heart and there will be it will ultimately condemn the world yeah am right because of because of a a refusal to recognize where their heart doesn't line up to the word of God Amen and we are out of time so I'm going to quit we can stand and have a word of prayer father I trust that you could take this scattered words that I would say and and piece it together for the people that maybe someone would have been encouraged and grab hold of something true and anchor themselves with it Lord it there'd be no no fear of the end Lord because there would be a recognition that we have a peace we have a savior Lord I ask that you would go with us throughout the day that you would be with us in the in the worship service and into the preaching of the Gospel preaching of the word we ask this thing in name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
