[19:11] that you are there in our midst, Father.
[19:14] And Lord, I come this evening. I want to
[19:16] make the [music] most of my opportunity.
[19:19] Present myself before you, Father.
[19:22] Look into the blood that you shed
[19:23] [music] at Calvary, Father.
[19:26] And your atonement is the same
[19:28] yesterday, today, and forever. Father, I
[19:31] pray that you have blessed the people.
[19:32] Bless those that stream. Lord, [music]
[19:34] as we gather the tithes and offerings, I

[20:10] a standard, [music] Lord, when the devil
[20:12] would come in like a flood. And you did
[20:15] that at Calvary. And we raise that up
[20:17] this evening, Father, and praying that
[20:18] [music] you would touch and heal your
[20:21] precious children. In Jesus' name we
[20:23] pray. Amen.

[40:29] right?
[40:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's Luke
[40:33] the 18th chapter
[40:36] and we read from verse
[40:40] 1
[40:42] to verse 8.
[40:53] Amen. You have it by saying, "Amen."

[40:56] &gt;&gt; I'm good. I'm good.
[41:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[41:15] Praise the Lord. uh you there by saying
[41:17] amen.
[41:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:19] &gt;&gt; Luke the 18th chapter verse one and it
[41:23] reads and he spake a parable unto them
[41:27] to the end that man ought always to pray
[41:31] and not to faint.
[41:33] Saying there was in a city a judge which
[41:36] fear not God neither regard man. And
[41:40] there was any and there was a widow in
[41:43] that city. And she came unto him,
[41:46] saying, "Avenge me of my adversary."
[41:50] And he would not for a while, but
[41:53] afterward he said within himself, though
[41:56] I feared not God, nor regard man, yet
[42:01] because this widow truth me, I will
[42:06] avenge her. I I will avenge her, lest by
[42:10] her continually coming she weary me. And
[42:14] the Lord said, "Hear what the unjust
[42:18] judge said. And shall not God avenge his
[42:22] own elect, which cries day and night
[42:26] unto him, though he beared long with
[42:29] them? I tell you that he will avenge
[42:34] them speededly.
[42:36] Nevertheless,
[42:38] when the son of man cometh,
[42:42] shall he find faith
[42:44] &gt;&gt; on the earth.
[42:46] &gt;&gt; Let us just bow our heads again. Kind
[42:48] heavenly father, Lord Jesus, we thank
[42:51] you, Lord Jesus, for uh for being here,
[42:55] Father, we just thank you for the
[42:57] reading of the word. Father, we just
[42:58] pray, oh God, that you bless the hears
[43:01] tonight, Father. Lord, you said we that
[43:04] have an ear to hear. Oh God, let us hear
[43:06] what the spirit have to say into the
[43:09] church. Father, will you take these dry
[43:10] lips of clay and Father, may you speak
[43:13] to our hearts, Father. You know the
[43:14] condition of your people, Lord. You know
[43:17] what they need, Father. And Lord, we
[43:19] depending on you tonight. We thank you
[43:21] in advance. We thank you for
[43:22] deliverance. We thank you for setting
[43:25] the captain free. We thank you for just
[43:28] being God. Thank you for your presence
[43:30] here tonight, Lord. Lord, you said in
[43:32] your word where there's two or three,
[43:34] you're in the midst. And so, Lord, we
[43:36] believe that. And Father, we act upon it
[43:39] this. We asking G asks in Jesus name by
[43:42] saying, "Amen." You may uh take your
[43:44] seat. Praise the Lord.
[43:47] &gt;&gt; Thank you, my brother. Amen. It's
[43:49] wonderful to be in the house of the
[43:50] Lord.
[43:53] My thought tonight [clears throat]
[43:55] by the help of the Lord uh
[43:59] bless the Lord. Uh my thought is uh it's
[44:03] revelation pardon me Luke the 18th
[44:07] chapter in the 8th verse and I read it
[44:09] again
[44:10] and here Jesus saying and I tell you
[44:13] that he will avenge them speededly
[44:17] nevertheless when the son of man cometh
[44:21] shall he find faith on the earth. So my
[44:24] thought tonight is shall he find faith
[44:28] on the earth? Now while we uh you still
[44:32] have your Bible, let's turn to uh
[44:35] Malachi 4, if you will. Malachi 4, you
[44:40] familiar with that scripture, I'm sure.
[44:42] Mal Malachi 4 and verse 5. Malachi 4 and
[44:49] verse 5. And it reads, "Behold, I will
[44:52] send
[44:54] you Elijah the prophet before the coming
[44:59] of the great and dreadful day of the
[45:02] Lord. How many you believe that tonight?
[45:05] &gt;&gt; And he shall turn the heart of the
[45:08] fathers to the children and the heart of
[45:11] the children to the father, lest I come
[45:14] and smite the earth with a curse. Can
[45:18] you say amen?
[45:19] &gt;&gt; Now we turn to last scripture. We turn
[45:22] to Revelation uh 10. Uh you familiar
[45:26] with that as well. Revelation 10 and uh
[45:31] we start from verse one and to verse 7.
[45:34] Would that be okay? And it reads,
[45:38] "And I and and I saw another mighty
[45:41] angel coming down from heaven clothed
[45:44] with a cloud, and a rainbow was upon his
[45:46] head, and his face was as it were the
[45:50] sun, and his feet as pillow of fire. And
[45:53] he had in his hand a little book open,
[45:57] and he set his right foot upon the sea,
[46:00] and his left foot on the earth. And he
[46:03] cried with a loud voice. And when he had
[46:06] and when and when a he cried with a loud
[46:10] voice as when a lion royeth. And when he
[46:14] had cried, seven thunders uttered their
[46:17] voices. And when the seven thunder had
[46:20] uttered their voices, I was about to
[46:23] write. And I heard a voice from heaven
[46:26] saying unto me, "Seal up those things
[46:29] which the seven thunder uttered, and
[46:32] write them not." And the angel which I
[46:35] saw standing upon the sea and upon the
[46:38] earth, lifted up his hand to heaven, and
[46:42] swear by him that liveth forever and
[46:45] ever, who created heaven, and the things
[46:48] that therein are in the earth, and the
[46:50] things that therein are, and the sea,
[46:53] and the things which there are therein,
[46:57] that there should be time no longer. But
[47:00] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[47:04] angel, when it shall begin to sound,
[47:07] when he begin to sound, the mysteries of
[47:10] God should be finished. Can you say
[47:13] amen?
[47:14] &gt;&gt; So tonight, uh praise [clears throat]
[47:16] the Lord. Uh again, my my thought
[47:22] is uh when [clears throat] uh shall he
[47:25] find faith on the earth? It's talking
[47:29] about this earth.
[47:30] &gt;&gt; It's talking about where you and I live
[47:33] &gt;&gt; when he return. Will he find faith? Now
[47:38] you know uh uh Jesus uh many of time
[47:42] when Jesus will will will uh talk to his
[47:46] believers uh he will mention more about
[47:49] his second coming than when he was on
[47:52] earth. But the thing was, when I return,
[47:57] will I find faith on the earth? That's
[47:59] that's the thing.
[48:01] &gt;&gt; And he didn't say, "When I come to
[48:03] church, well, I found uh people at the
[48:06] altar praying."
[48:07] &gt;&gt; He didn't say, "When I come to church,
[48:09] uh uh will I will I find people uh uh uh
[48:13] praising the Lord? Will I find the
[48:15] church filled up? Uh will will I will I
[48:18] find uh the podium filled up with
[48:21] ministers?" Uh he didn't say none of
[48:23] that. He said when I return will I find
[48:26] faith? That's the thing. So uh we
[48:30] realize that uh Jesus uh you know the
[48:34] question is will I find faith and we
[48:37] know that the prophet of God taught us
[48:39] faith is a revelation and how we really
[48:42] need revelation in this hour brother and
[48:45] sister. You know, we're living in an
[48:47] hour where, you know, when you talk
[48:49] about the Bible, this this B IBL E, you
[48:52] know, it's the basic instruction before
[48:54] we leave the earth. But when you talk
[48:56] about the Bible, now Satan, he hates the
[48:59] Bible or he just hate the Bible. But
[49:03] there's one uh there's two particular
[49:06] scriptures that he hate the worst. The
[49:08] prophet of God taught us that is Genesis
[49:11] and is Revelation. So we realize that
[49:15] Genesis is a sea chapter. Amen. It tells
[49:18] the beginning. Amen. But Revelation
[49:21] tells the end. Amen. And by Revelation
[49:25] being revealed to us. Amen. We begin to
[49:28] realize who we are and what we are
[49:31] raised up for. You know, brother and
[49:32] sister, I'm just not here tonight uh
[49:36] just to say, you know, I want to come
[49:37] and preach here. I believe with all my
[49:40] heart we're here to do the king's job.
[49:42] Amen. We're not here just to say, you
[49:45] know, Brother Jason, uh, he's my friend.
[49:47] I love Brother Matt. We all that's been
[49:49] done away with. We want to be led by the
[49:52] Lord. The Bible say they that are led by
[49:54] the spirit, they are the sons of God.
[49:57] And brothers and sisters, I believe
[49:59] tonight that I'm speaking to people here
[50:01] tonight that actually come from God. I
[50:05] believe brother and sister we I'm
[50:06] talking to people tonight that was in
[50:08] the very PART THE VERY back part of
[50:11] God's mind but now you are being made
[50:14] manifested do you believe that tonight
[50:17] &gt;&gt; will I find faith on the earth Jesus
[50:20] asked the question when I when I return
[50:23] shall I find faith on the earth oh
[50:25] praise the Lord and you found out that
[50:28] when Jesus was on the earth amen he
[50:31] began to
[50:33] talk with it disciples. And uh when he
[50:37] began to talk to disciples, you found
[50:39] out in Luke, you don't have to turn Luke
[50:41] 17 and verse 22, he said and he said
[50:45] unto his disciple, though those was the
[50:47] elected one, those was chosen. He said,
[50:50] "The days will come when you shall
[50:54] desire to see one of
[50:58] the day of the son of man,
[51:02] &gt;&gt; and you shall not see it." Wow.
[51:06] Ye shall desire to see one of the days
[51:10] of the coming of the son of man. Are you
[51:13] with me tonight? Now Jesus was saying
[51:16] something but he told disciples you know
[51:20] he says and brothers and sisters the
[51:22] thing that we are being witnessing of
[51:25] the thing that God has began to show to
[51:28] us. Amen. These are the things that
[51:31] prophet desire to look upon brother and
[51:35] sister with this is one of the greatest
[51:37] hour of all time. You know I don't
[51:40] understand why sometime you know I can't
[51:43] wait till Wednesday night come because
[51:46] amen I feel THE URGE AND AMEN I just
[51:48] can't wait till THOSE DOORS OPEN JUST TO
[51:51] hear what God have to say because
[51:53] BROTHER AND SISTER I I'M NOT PLANNING ON
[51:56] BEING HERE. I was telling the pastor in
[51:58] the back, I was telling the pastor in
[52:00] the back, you know, I was talking to uh
[52:02] uh my wife's uncle the other day and he
[52:05] was talking about just a few days ago
[52:07] and he said, you know, I don't the way
[52:10] things going on and all the killing and
[52:12] and and and the filth and and all these
[52:14] things happening on the earth. And he
[52:17] began to say, you know, he said, I can't
[52:20] see we being here another 50 years. I
[52:22] don't even want to hear that.
[52:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[52:26] &gt;&gt; I was my wife and I, we was fortunate
[52:29] enough to have six grands
[52:31] &gt;&gt; and you know I one of our grants live
[52:34] with us and she nine years old and her
[52:36] name is Hadassa. I don't want to look at
[52:39] her and say Hadasa I can't wait to see
[52:41] you graduate from college.
[52:45] &gt;&gt; She only n years old. You know how much
[52:48] it's you you think about from 9 years
[52:51] old until she get out of college and you
[52:54] see how terrible
[52:56] &gt;&gt; this world has become.
[52:58] &gt;&gt; Brother, I don't understand you know why
[53:00] people are looking for a long stretch
[53:02] out now. I'm not trying to tell you and
[53:05] you know I'm not trying to tell you YOU
[53:07] KNOW TO START PLANNING. WE SHOULD.
[53:10] BROTHER BRANDON SAID AMEN. IF WE going
[53:12] to DIG TERS KEEP DIGGING TERS. IF YOU
[53:14] WANT TO ADD ANOTHER ROOM ON THE HOUSE,
[53:16] ADD ANOTHER ROOM. ARE YOU HEARING ME?
[53:19] BUT ALWAYS LOOK FOR HIM TO COME. AMEN.
[53:22] CUZ I BELIEVE CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD,
[53:24] WE ARE JUST THAT CLOSE.
[53:26] &gt;&gt; IT'S NO TIME TO BE PLAYING CHURCH. I
[53:29] BELIEVE WE ARE SO CLOSE, CHURCH. I'M
[53:31] LOOKING FOR HIM AT any time.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; That's the God heaven truth. Now, I'm
[53:36] going to say something. Y'all may think
[53:38] I'm crazy, but I really don't care.
[53:41] &gt;&gt; I've been through enough. I really don't
[53:43] care. I'm not a man pleaser. I'm going
[53:46] to preach what I got to preach. I'd
[53:48] reckon we could go back in the hotel AND
[53:50] MY WIFE AND I, WE GOING BACK NORTH. BUT
[53:53] I want to tell you, church, I'm I'm
[53:55] living in a time, church. It's time to
[53:58] get real serious with God.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; Now, when Paul said in I think in 2
[54:03] Corinthians 13 and5, if I'm not
[54:05] mistaken, he said, "Examine yourself."
[54:09] &gt;&gt; Examine yourself. Now, the word of God
[54:12] did not tell me uh to examine brother
[54:16] Matt's life.
[54:19] &gt;&gt; God didn't tell me uh to go by his house
[54:22] and see how he's treating his wife.
[54:24] That's not in the word.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; He didn't tell me to find out, go on
[54:29] YouTube and go on the church channel and
[54:32] watch the service and see how they're
[54:34] worshiping.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; That's your business how you worship.
[54:38] But the Bible tell me to examine
[54:41] yourself
[54:44] &gt;&gt; and see whether you
[54:46] &gt;&gt; be in the faith.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; Now let's stop there a minute. Examine
[54:53] yourself
[54:54] &gt;&gt; and see rather Paul said that you be in
[54:57] not a faith
[54:59] &gt;&gt; but the faith.
[55:01] &gt;&gt; Faith has a level. Now brothers and
[55:03] sisters, the faith that Jesus was
[55:06] talking about, he said, "When I return
[55:09] back to earth, will I find faith?"
[55:13] &gt;&gt; You know, and you know, if if we talking
[55:15] about uh a a faith, you know, that you
[55:19] know, pastor, you know what the Lord did
[55:21] for me? What pastor, I've been praying
[55:25] and uh my credit's not real good. And
[55:28] believe it or not, pastor, I had faith.
[55:31] And I went on that parking lot and I
[55:33] claimed it in the name of Jesus. And
[55:35] guess what? Before I know it, I was
[55:38] riding in that car.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; And the pastor said, "Oh my God, that is
[55:43] faith." That's good.
[55:44] &gt;&gt; But that's not the faith I'm talking
[55:46] about.
[55:52] If that's the faith, then uh the witch
[55:55] doctor has faith.
[55:58] &gt;&gt; Denomination has faith.
[56:01] &gt;&gt; So that's a different faith we talking
[56:03] about.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; So it look like God is trying to tell us
[56:08] this faith it had to be contended for.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; This faith has to be restored.
[56:15] Amen.
[56:16] &gt;&gt; This faith have to be RESTORED BY
[56:19] MALACHI 4.
[56:21] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[56:23] &gt;&gt; So, brother and sister, that's what we
[56:26] want to know. That's I'm going go ahead
[56:29] and take this jacket off. Praise the
[56:30] Lord.
[56:31] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[56:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:33] &gt;&gt; That faith has got to be restored back.
[56:37] So Jesus was saying, "When I return,
[56:41] will I find faith on the earth?" But how
[56:45] many are so happy to know? Amen. We
[56:47] don't have to be worried about a thing.
[56:51] We don't have to wonder uh will I be
[56:53] left behind.
[56:55] &gt;&gt; Don't have that type of mind.
[56:57] &gt;&gt; I want to believe tonight that he can't
[57:00] leave without me.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; I believe, brother and sister, I believe
[57:04] that I was in in the back part of God's
[57:07] mind before there was a world. Are y'all
[57:10] hearing me tonight? Before there was a
[57:12] star. BEFORE THERE WAS A MOLECULE,
[57:14] before there was anything, I was in the
[57:17] back part OF GOD'S MIND. SO WHEN I WAS
[57:19] IN GOD'S MIND, BROTHER, SISTER, we were
[57:22] the very attributes of God. And you know
[57:25] what GOD DID, BROTHER? YOU AND I WAS IN
[57:28] HIS MIND. Can I preach a little bit? Can
[57:30] I just preach tonight? Amen. Now, WE WAS
[57:33] IN THE MIND OF GOD. BUT WHEN GOD GAVE
[57:36] BIRTH TO HIS TO THAT THAT GENESIS
[57:39] GENESIS 1 AND THREE, AMEN. WHEN GOD
[57:41] SAID, "LET THERE BE LIGHT." BROTHER
[57:43] BRANDON SAID THAT LIGHT CAME OUT.
[57:46] &gt;&gt; WHERE WAS YOU and I?
[57:50] &gt;&gt; Who said that?
[57:53] &gt;&gt; You was a part of him.
[57:56] &gt;&gt; You were his thought.
[57:58] &gt;&gt; You know what I love about God? God
[58:01] don't change his mind.
[58:03] &gt;&gt; We stumble. We mess up. We get
[58:05] discouraged. We allow we allow what Paul
[58:08] said, condemnation just get you to
[58:10] feeling guilty. But let me tell you
[58:12] what, church. Let me tell YOU WHAT. THE
[58:15] DEVIL CANNOT stop a true bride of Christ
[58:18] when you begin to recognize who you are
[58:21] and what you are RAISED UP FOR. THE
[58:24] DEVIL IS in trouble.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; You young people, you understand what
[58:28] I'm saying? I don't want to preach. I I
[58:30] I want to go I want to kind of uh go a
[58:33] little deep tonight, but I'm going to
[58:34] see where the Lord take me. I don't
[58:36] know. I hope you hang in with me. We're
[58:38] going to go for a ride, sir.
[58:39] &gt;&gt; But do you love the Lord?
[58:41] &gt;&gt; Oh, man. I feel at home. I'm going to
[58:43] tell y'all something. I'm going to say
[58:45] it. I didn't want to say it. Uh I called
[58:48] the pastor and I hadn't been here since
[58:51] 2017.
[58:53] And uh you know uh brother Brandon says,
[58:56] "Was a dream, tell it like take is a
[58:58] dream." You know, I ain't trying to make
[59:00] nothing out of that cuz dream is not
[59:02] always an absolute. But I just want to
[59:04] say that the dream came to pass. So in
[59:07] my dream uh I was dreaming and in the
[59:11] dream I saw a burgundy Ford pickup. Then
[59:15] when I saw the burgundy Ford pickup and
[59:18] next from the burgundy Ford pickup the
[59:21] scene changed. And guess what I saw
[59:23] church?
[59:25] What I saw? I was looking from this
[59:27] direction and this is what I saw.
[59:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:31] &gt;&gt; I had been here about eight years.
[59:34] But from the Ford truck, I saw this.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; I I got up out of the bed. My wife was
[59:41] asleep.
[59:43] I said, "My the devil said, "Don't call
[59:46] him. Don't call him. He's not going to
[59:47] let you preach.
[59:50] Don't call him. Don't call him." But
[59:52] see, I didn't pay him no attention.
[59:55] &gt;&gt; I got out of the bed. I took my phone
[59:58] and I shot him a text.
[1:00:01] about eight years now.
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; So,
[1:00:06] I went back in the bedroom and I told my
[1:00:08] wife, I said, "Honey, I said, uh, I just
[1:00:12] shot a text to a pastor." I said, "I
[1:00:15] hadn't been there in a long time." So,
[1:00:16] she named a couple of pastors. I said,
[1:00:17] "No." And, uh, I said, "I hadn't been
[1:00:20] there in a long time." And uh, and I
[1:00:24] said, "Well,
[1:00:26] we going to try the spirit." I said, "We
[1:00:29] have to go from there." Then I heard my
[1:00:30] phone saying bling.
[1:00:34] I go and pick it up. He said, you know,
[1:00:36] he's he'd be more than happy to have me,
[1:00:38] you know. So we here tonight. So that
[1:00:41] being said, I believe I'm in the perfect
[1:00:43] will of God.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; And you know, and I I I believe church
[1:00:49] Jesus was very concerned because he saw
[1:00:53] the condition of time. Remember now what
[1:00:56] Jesus was talking about. He said, "When
[1:00:58] the son of man come," now now I'm not a
[1:01:02] son of man. Are you hearing me? But what
[1:01:05] Jesus saw was his returning back. And he
[1:01:09] said, "When I come back, will I find
[1:01:11] faith?"
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; So, we're living in an hour where people
[1:01:16] are really actually cooling off.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; OH MY MY. CAN YOU IMAGINE? We're living
[1:01:23] in an hour when people are really
[1:01:25] cooling off. Brothers and sisters,
[1:01:28] there's no time to cool off. There's no
[1:01:30] time to uh look back. We got to move
[1:01:34] forward because I believe with all of my
[1:01:36] heart, I believe we are so close.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; Now, now, now I'm going to say something
[1:01:42] and you young people going to really
[1:01:43] think I'm crazy. Now, I'm going to tell
[1:01:46] you where I'm at right about now. I'm so
[1:01:48] much looking for,
[1:01:51] you know, a lot of time you say you you
[1:01:53] you it's okay to come down here.
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; I I need some walking room.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; Next time we're going to have to move
[1:01:58] some of these things cuz I just love to
[1:02:00] walk.
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, you know, a lot of time we we
[1:02:04] you know, people people will say, you
[1:02:06] know, uh I'm I'm ready to go. I want to
[1:02:09] see Jesus and and I I you know, I'm
[1:02:12] ready for the rapture to take place
[1:02:14] because I just want to see Jesus. You
[1:02:16] know, I just want to look upon his face.
[1:02:18] But you know, we all want to do that,
[1:02:19] right?
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; We all would love to. How many would
[1:02:22] love to look upon his faith? How many
[1:02:24] would love when this rapture take place?
[1:02:26] The first faith, the when this rapture
[1:02:29] take place, when the changing OF THESE
[1:02:32] BODY, HOW MANY WOULD JUST LOVE TO look
[1:02:34] at Jesus face? BUT I GOT GOOD NEWS FOR
[1:02:37] YOU. THE FIRST FACE YOU WILL SEE WILL
[1:02:40] NOT BE JESUS.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S WHAT THE BIBLE SAY. IF YOU
[1:02:45] GOT A BROTHER, OH, YOU GOING TO SEE
[1:02:48] GRANDPA. ARE YOU HEARING ME? THE FIRST
[1:02:50] FACE YOU WILL SEE IS YOUR LOVED ONE. You
[1:02:53] said, "WHAT YOU TALKING ABOUT, BROTHER
[1:02:55] CHILDREN?" PAUL SAID, "AMEN. THE DEAD IN
[1:02:58] CHRIST SHALL RISE WHAT?" FIRST,
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; AND WE THAT ARE alive and remain.

[1:03:33] might have to get that mic." Huh? This
[1:03:36] ain't gonna It don't work with a
[1:03:38] preacher like me. I was at brother Don
[1:03:40] Reagan. I was dragging the microphone on
[1:03:43] the floor and and I was wondering what
[1:03:45] was going on. I I thought someone was
[1:03:47] cutting me off, but Amen.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; alive and remain.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; Alive and remain. There's a lot of
[1:03:54] people, they're alive, but they're not
[1:03:57] remain.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; They're not remaining in the truth.
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? So, people are
[1:04:03] looking for the coming of the Lord.
[1:04:05] THEY'RE LOOKING BUT A LOT OF FOLKS.
[1:04:07] BROTHER BRANDON said there's going to be
[1:04:08] millions that's going to be mimics and
[1:04:10] sell there's going to be a lot of people
[1:04:12] that's going to be ACTING CHRISTIAN. NOW
[1:04:14] YOU KNOW BROTHER Brandon said there's
[1:04:16] two type of Christian. How many you know
[1:04:17] that?
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; How many know that? You know that
[1:04:21] sister. Oh praise. There's two type of
[1:04:24] Christian. There's one with the Holy
[1:04:25] Ghost and the other don't.
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; Huh? But because the word Christian is
[1:04:30] Christlike. SO YOU CAN COME TO CHURCH
[1:04:31] with a long dress on, long hair. That
[1:04:34] don't mean it's in your soul.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN HE COME BACK, I WANT TO BE
[1:04:38] READY. ARE you hearing me? I WANT TO
[1:04:40] HAVE ON MY WEDDING GARMENT BECAUSE
[1:04:42] church look
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; since you know what been happening.
[1:04:46] Well, you got a smile on your face. I'm
[1:04:48] telling you. I thank God you're in the
[1:04:49] front cuz I don't need nobody sad up
[1:04:51] here. I need all happy face. Happy face.
[1:04:53] Happy face. Are you hearing me? SO WE
[1:04:55] LIVING IN AN HOUR, CHURCH. IT'S SO CLOSE
[1:04:58] TO THE COMING OF THE LORD. AND YOU MIGHT
[1:05:00] BE think I'm crazy, but I'm looking now
[1:05:03] BECAUSE WHAT GOD HAS BEEN REVEALING to
[1:05:05] me when God, you know, the Bible,
[1:05:08] brother brother Matt, the Bible has
[1:05:11] become a a what?
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; Talk to me.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; I I love for y'all to Oh my. The Bible
[1:05:18] had become a what?
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; A new book.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful?
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; But you know, a lot of people still
[1:05:25] don't understand. But I thank God that
[1:05:28] God sent a prophet in this hour. Amen.
[1:05:32] Oh, praise the Lord. You know, a lot of
[1:05:34] people don't like you to preach that
[1:05:35] way, but I feel like I'm at home. Amen.
[1:05:38] Amen. So, let me tell you, church, it's
[1:05:40] getting to a place now. God started
[1:05:43] revealing this word. And I feel in my
[1:05:45] heart that we are so close until just
[1:05:48] the OTHER DAY, I WAS IN MY CLOSET AND I
[1:05:52] DECLARE I THOUGHT I SAW SOMEONE IN THE
[1:05:54] CORNER. OH, YOU MIGHT BE THINK I'M
[1:05:56] CRAZY. LOOK, [screaming] I AM LOOKING
[1:05:59] FOR MY MAMA.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; MY MOTHER BEEN GONE FOR 34 YEARS. BUT
[1:06:04] LET ME TELL YOU WHAT, WHEN SHE COME, I'M
[1:06:06] GOING TO RECOGNIZE HER. BUT LET ME TELL
[1:06:09] YOU WHAT, BUT BEFORE SHE COME, WHEN
[1:06:11] CHRIST COME, HE GOT TO FIND SUCH FAITH
[1:06:14] ON THE EARTH.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; My
[1:06:21] faith on the earth. People can't ought
[1:06:23] to heal the headache.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; My
[1:06:29] but I'm coming back shall I find faith
[1:06:33] on the earth.
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; Jesus began to talk to the disciples and
[1:06:37] we realize that the coming of Christ
[1:06:42] comes three times. Are y'all with me?
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; He come the first time as a redeemer,
[1:06:47] right? And the second time is the
[1:06:51] rapture, right? And the third time, if
[1:06:54] that's when he comes and he reigns, he
[1:06:56] sits on David's throne. That's right.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; Are y'all with me? I love you. I love it
[1:07:00] tonight. Amen. But let me tell you what,
[1:07:03] Jesus, there is there is three
[1:07:06] comingings of the son of man, right?
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; And I love that. Y'all talk back to me.
[1:07:10] Man, I feel so good tonight. Oh, Lord
[1:07:13] have mercy. How many of you got to go to
[1:07:14] school tomorrow? Could you miss one day?
[1:07:18] [snorts]
[1:07:21] But see, there are three comingings of
[1:07:24] the son of man. Lord help us tonight.
[1:07:26] Amen.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; But I thank God that it the Bible said,
[1:07:30] you remember in Matthew the 13th chapter
[1:07:33] and probably verse 10 uh and disciples
[1:07:37] Jesus was talking with the the believers
[1:07:40] of that day. And Jesus said, Jesus began
[1:07:43] to tell them was talking to them in
[1:07:46] parables.
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; And the disciples asked him a question.
[1:07:49] They said, "Why do you you you talking
[1:07:52] parables and and things of that nature."
[1:07:54] But what Jesus said, "It is given to you
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; to know the mystery." You know what I
[1:08:00] found? A lot of people, brother Matt,
[1:08:02] you know, WHEN YOU START TALKING ABOUT
[1:08:04] MYSTERY, THEY turn you off. I had
[1:08:06] somebody told me, "We don't need to know
[1:08:08] all those mystery. We just need to know
[1:08:10] that Jesus died on the cross and you
[1:08:12] know and all that. You know what you
[1:08:14] got? You're going to be preaching that
[1:08:16] kind of revelation. You're going to be
[1:08:17] right here.
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; We need revelation more than you can
[1:08:22] imagine.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU HEARING ME? IT'S GOT TO BE
[1:08:25] REVEALED to us. Brother Brandon said the
[1:08:27] bride of Christ will be waiting on the
[1:08:30] revelation of the rapture. ARE YOU
[1:08:32] HEARING ME? I BELIEVE BROTHER AND SISTER
[1:08:34] WE ARE LIVING IN THOSE HOUR. THIS IS THE
[1:08:37] HOUR WHERE GOD IS LOOKING FOR A CHURCH.
[1:08:39] AND TO THINK ABOUT IT, HE SAID, "WHEN I
[1:08:41] RETURN, WILL I FIND A CHURCH ON FIRE?"
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; WILL I FIND A CHURCH ON FIRE? YOU SAID,
[1:08:48] "WAIT A MINUTE, brothers and children."
[1:08:49] So, what you want us to do? You want us
[1:08:51] to get say amen and holler and and
[1:08:54] scream, "No, you don't have to do a
[1:08:55] thing, but just pull.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; Will I find a church
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; on fire?"
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; So, we see the coming of the son of man.
[1:09:03] Now when Jesus was on the earth, we look
[1:09:06] at in the book of Luke, he began to talk
[1:09:08] with his disciples. He began to tell
[1:09:12] them different thing and and when Jesus
[1:09:15] came on the earth, he was fulfilling
[1:09:18] scripture.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; He knew exactly who he was.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; Do you know who you are? So Jesus would
[1:09:25] tell the disciples uh Jesus knew that it
[1:09:28] was prophesized of him in Deuteronomy
[1:09:31] the 18th chapter and I believe the 15th
[1:09:34] verse where he said the Lord your God
[1:09:37] shall raise up a prophet like unto me.
[1:09:40] So when Jesus was on the earth he was a
[1:09:43] prophet. Are you with me?
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; But he began to talk with his disciples.
[1:09:49] He began to work with his disciple. But
[1:09:51] let me come on down now. One thing I
[1:09:53] love about Jesus, Jesus had three pull
[1:09:57] to his ministry.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; Right, sister.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; He had three pulls. Boy, I love this. I
[1:10:03] love when the young people can shake
[1:10:05] their head. Oh my. I know I got to
[1:10:06] preach tonight. Amen. Jesus had three
[1:10:09] pull to his ministry. He had a first
[1:10:11] pull. That's all right. He had a second
[1:10:14] pull. And he had a third pull. That's
[1:10:16] right. His first pull, he did miracles.
[1:10:19] He did signs and things of that nature.
[1:10:21] And his second pull was Amen. Oh, praise
[1:10:24] the Lord. His second pull was what?
[1:10:26] Church of the living God. You know
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; exactly what it was.
[1:10:34] He was discerning the heart.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; And his third pull
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; was preaching to the total lost.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; That was the third pull. Are you hearing
[1:10:46] me?
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. But as he began to preach, now
[1:10:51] remember, I want y'all to follow me real
[1:10:53] closely now. Get get real close up to
[1:10:55] me. You already heard these things, but
[1:10:57] I just love talking about them. Now,
[1:10:59] think about when Jesus was here on this
[1:11:01] earth as a as a physical man when he
[1:11:05] would do I I think one of the time he
[1:11:08] turned the water into wine. Y'all
[1:11:09] remember that? Can you imagine? Can you
[1:11:12] imagine a wedding getting ready to
[1:11:14] start, brother? and you you you know you
[1:11:16] at a wedding and and and and and there's
[1:11:19] there's the water that the the pots has
[1:11:21] no more wine in it. It ran out of wine
[1:11:23] and you got all your guests there and a
[1:11:25] big wedding and it ran out of wine. But
[1:11:28] can you imagine Jesus didn't panic a bit
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; because he he knew who he was. But what
[1:11:34] he did, he said, "Bring them, FILL THEM
[1:11:36] UP." AND WHAT HE DID, he turned the
[1:11:37] water into wine. But now when Jesus did
[1:11:41] things like that, a lot of people I
[1:11:43] could imagine they began to follow him
[1:11:46] because they love that miracles. You
[1:11:48] know, they they you know, some of them
[1:11:50] just say, "My God, can you imagine a lot
[1:11:52] of them lay down at night and you say,
[1:11:54] "My, do you saw Jesus turn that water
[1:11:56] into wine? You know what? I got a need
[1:11:58] myself. You know, I need a better job.
[1:12:01] You know, I need a better house. I saw
[1:12:04] this house on the hill. You know, I'm
[1:12:06] going to follow Jesus and tomorrow when
[1:12:08] I go to his meeting, I'm going to tell
[1:12:10] Jesus I'm gonna let his lay his hands on
[1:12:13] me. Now remember NOW THAT WAS JESUS
[1:12:15] FRESH POOL.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? So when Jesus did
[1:12:18] his first pull, he turned the water into
[1:12:20] wine. And one DAY HE HE SOUGHT THEM DOWN
[1:12:23] IN IN hundreds and tens and five. Are
[1:12:26] y'all with me? And and brother brothers,
[1:12:28] you know WHAT HE DID WHEN HE SAW HIM
[1:12:30] DOWN? CAN YOU IMAGINE the disciples must
[1:12:32] have looked at him and said, "Man, this
[1:12:34] is so embarrassing." I mean those folk
[1:12:36] was coming from all over the hillside
[1:12:38] and he only had two little fishes and
[1:12:40] five loaves of bread.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; But see, he was a creator. He was a
[1:12:45] prophet, right? Right on the earth. So
[1:12:48] what did he do? He sought them down and
[1:12:50] he be fed fed all those people with two
[1:12:54] little fishes and five loaves of bread
[1:12:57] and the crowd began to grow. Oh,
[1:13:00] everybody love the word got around. You
[1:13:02] heard about this man named Jesus. Oh my.
[1:13:05] Everybody want to talk with him.
[1:13:07] Everybody want to see him. Oh my. They
[1:13:10] just just love being in his presence.
[1:13:12] Amen. Because of the uh the loaves and
[1:13:15] the and the miracle cuz I mean be honest
[1:13:18] church. Who wouldn't follow a man that
[1:13:20] could just speak the word and and things
[1:13:22] happen? You know, you you got a need and
[1:13:24] you got a financially need and you just
[1:13:27] be in the presence of Jesus and he just
[1:13:29] speak. Just think about Jeriah's
[1:13:31] daughter was sick. Amen. And Jesus just
[1:13:33] told the told the family member just to
[1:13:36] go out the room. Amen. But he be to
[1:13:39] speak, Amen. life into the little girl.
[1:13:41] Are you hearing me now? Who want to be
[1:13:44] in a church like that? Oh my. They begin
[1:13:47] to follow him and church of the living
[1:13:49] God. I can imagine. Amen. Jesus church
[1:13:52] was filled up. Oh my. They love him
[1:13:55] because of his miracles and and things
[1:13:57] of that nature. And I found a lot of
[1:14:00] time, you know, [snorts] you go to
[1:14:01] churches a lot of time if you could just
[1:14:03] get the people just jumping and holling
[1:14:06] and shouting and screaming. Amen.
[1:14:08] They'll go back home and SAY, "DIDN'T WE
[1:14:10] HAD A GOOD TIME?" OH MY. YOU ALMOST ASK
[1:14:13] THEM, "WHAT DID THE preacher preach on?"
[1:14:15] I don't know. But God knows we had a
[1:14:17] good singing. GOD KNOW. OH MY. I DIDN'T
[1:14:21] KNOW THE PASTOR COULD SANG MIND. You
[1:14:23] seen that sister shout. OH, THE LORD IS
[1:14:25] in our church. Oh, they love the fishes
[1:14:27] and the bread. But let me TELL YOU,
[1:14:29] CHURCH. OH MY. THAT JESUS WAS GETTING
[1:14:31] READY TO TURN A CORNER, BUT THEY DIDN'T
[1:14:33] KNOW IT, CHURCH. AND JUST AS IT IS
[1:14:36] TODAY, A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE NOT READY TO
[1:14:38] TURN A CORNER.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; So Jesus done those miracles and my they
[1:14:47] will follow him because of the miracle.
[1:14:50] Amen. But then then it came a time and
[1:14:53] it's first and he discerned their heart.
[1:14:56] He began to tell them what they was
[1:14:58] talking about. Jesus perceived their
[1:15:00] thoughts. Amen. Can you imagine? You
[1:15:03] know that must was a scary thing when
[1:15:06] when he could look at you and tell you
[1:15:08] what's on your mind.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; You know, you know that's amazing. if he
[1:15:13] could look at you and tell you what you
[1:15:16] was going to do before you left the
[1:15:17] house, but you went and put it on the
[1:15:19] kitchen table, but you took it off the
[1:15:21] kitchen table and you ke it in the
[1:15:22] bedroom. You look at your wife and said,
[1:15:24] "How did he know that? We know what we
[1:15:28] need to go to his church."
[1:15:32] I mean, this is God. We love going to
[1:15:35] his church. You know, this man could
[1:15:37] mind, I've never seen nobody that
[1:15:39] concerned. I mean I mean I had some
[1:15:42] problem was going on in my life and how
[1:15:45] in the n you know I have been to places
[1:15:48] brother brother brother brother brother
[1:15:48] brother brother brother brother brother
[1:15:48] brother brother brother brother brother
[1:15:48] brother brother brother brother brother
[1:15:48] brother brother brother brother brother
[1:15:49] brother brother brother brother brother
[1:15:49] brother brother brother brother brother
[1:15:49] brother brother brother brother brother
[1:15:49] brothers
[1:15:51] I've been to places where get the
[1:15:54] ministering I was at a church a few
[1:15:57] months ago and I'm I've never done this
[1:16:00] before and I preach a lot of time I take
[1:16:04] a brother and I demonstrate with him you
[1:16:07] know but y I tell him to stand up And I
[1:16:10] began to demonstrate with him. But this
[1:16:13] particular time, I'm not g not gonna get
[1:16:15] you. I I I read you. I just deserve your
[1:16:17] heart.
[1:16:19] Huh? I'm not going to do that.
[1:16:25] So, I was at this church and
[1:16:28] and [snorts]
[1:16:29] God knows I've never
[1:16:32] will ever do something like that, but
[1:16:33] when the Holy Spirit had me to do, I was
[1:16:35] like, "Lord have mercy. This is a
[1:16:37] female. Lord, what are you telling me to
[1:16:39] do? This sister was sitting and I said,
[1:16:42] "My sister," I said, "Jesus love you."
[1:16:44] And I said, "Stand up, my sister." And I
[1:16:46] took her by the hand. I was like, "Lord,
[1:16:48] what in the world?"
[1:16:50] But pastor, I got nervous. I said,
[1:16:53] "Lord, it's a female. Lord, what you
[1:16:55] getting ready to tell me to do?"
[1:16:58] You know, everybody look. I asked her to
[1:17:00] stand up. I said, "You know what,
[1:17:02] sister?" I said, "I want to tell you
[1:17:04] something." I said, "My" I said,
[1:17:06] "Church," I said, "Don't she have
[1:17:08] beautiful hair?" I was like, "This
[1:17:10] getting a little too touchy here." I was
[1:17:13] nervous. I said, "Don't she have
[1:17:15] beautiful hair?" And she and I just took
[1:17:17] her and and she kind of did her hair
[1:17:19] like that long, beautiful hair. I was
[1:17:21] like, "Lord, what are we doing here?"
[1:17:23] And the Lord just like keep on. And I
[1:17:25] said, you know, sister, I said, you
[1:17:27] know, I said, "What the devil would love
[1:17:29] to do with you?" I said, "He would love
[1:17:32] to get you out of church." I said first
[1:17:34] of all what the devil will want to do I
[1:17:37] said he will turn you against somebody
[1:17:39] in the church once he turn you against
[1:17:41] that individual NOW THE DEVIL DON'T CARE
[1:17:44] THE DEVIL NOT GOING TO SO MUCH TURN you
[1:17:46] I mean most time people won't stop going
[1:17:48] to church because of the deacon now
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; huh they they most people don't stop
[1:17:53] going to church because uh uh the
[1:17:56] musician uh uh the song leader most
[1:17:58] people are y'all with me
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; y'all know where I'm going right most
[1:18:02] people are quit church because of who?
[1:18:05] Y'all talk back to ME. I TOLD YOU TO
[1:18:07] TALK to me now. Who?
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; The who?
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; The pastor. [laughter]
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; Absolutely. The truth. That's your
[1:18:15] target. And when he's a God man, the
[1:18:19] devil go and what and I told those
[1:18:21] things. I SAID THE first thing the devil
[1:18:23] want to do, he want to turn you against
[1:18:25] the pastor. Once he locked that
[1:18:26] communication, then he could work with
[1:18:28] you BECAUSE YOU CAN'T HEAR. said there
[1:18:31] be a pastor, a shepherd. And how can you
[1:18:34] hear except he's been set?
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; YOU THERE'S GOT TO BE SHEPHERD. I DON'T
[1:18:38] CARE WHO YOU ARE, how long you look,
[1:18:41] I've been preaching now about 42 years,
[1:18:43] but guess what? I need a shepherd.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; The thing that God would tell my pastor
[1:18:49] that he won't tell me, God made him the
[1:18:51] ox of the team. Are y'all with me? Oh,
[1:18:53] I'm writing something right now. And
[1:18:55] sometime you feel like you could do like
[1:18:57] you want but no brothers and sisters,
[1:18:59] you need a pastor.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; You need A SHEPHERD.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; LOOK CHURCH, WE LIVING IN THE HOUR NOW.
[1:19:07] Don't don't lead yourself. You say what
[1:19:09] we need the Holy Ghost for.
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; That's what the Holy Ghost is for.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; Don't don't get it wrong, brother Young.
[1:19:18] There ain't no man can teach you
[1:19:19] nothing.
[1:19:23] That ain't that nothing. The Bible said,
[1:19:24] uh, John 14:26, it say the comforter
[1:19:28] that teach you and lead you and guide
[1:19:30] you. Right? Brother Brandon says the
[1:19:31] inside teacher, right? Now, you can hear
[1:19:34] the voice of your pastor. But if God
[1:19:36] don't reveal it to you, you'll be like
[1:19:38] Matthew. Are you hearing me? It'll be
[1:19:41] like Matthew the 13th chapter, I believe
[1:19:43] about the 16th verse. Jesus said,
[1:19:45] "Blessed are your eyes."
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; How many you thank God for your eyes?
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; Put your hand on your eyes. what I'm
[1:19:52] talking the eyes I'm talking about.
[1:19:58] Praise the Lord.
[1:20:01] Jesus said, "Blessed are your eyes."
[1:20:03] What eyes were Jesus talking about?
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; He's talking about those. Huh?
[1:20:09] Now, Paul said in Now, I'm going
[1:20:11] somewhere else now. Huh? My goodness
[1:20:14] gracious. And I come down here. I But
[1:20:16] Paul said in I think it's in uh I think
[1:20:20] it's in Corinthian. And I just go ahead
[1:20:21] and quote Paul said the things that you
[1:20:24] see with the natural eye, they are
[1:20:27] temporal. Right? But he said the things
[1:20:29] that you you know you can't see are
[1:20:32] eternal.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; So he TALKING ABOUT PAUL TALKING ABOUT
[1:20:35] the inner man and the outer man. So
[1:20:37] brother Brandon says brother Brandon
[1:20:39] said we we think we brother Brandon said
[1:20:41] we look with our eyes.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; He said but you see with your heart.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? So I can show you
[1:20:49] something ALL DAY LONG, BUT I'm talking
[1:20:51] about when it come to the revelation,
[1:20:53] YOU CAN'T SEE IT WITH the natural eyes.
[1:20:55] You got to see it. You'd say, "Wait a
[1:20:57] minute, brother children. I thought you
[1:20:58] see I thought we see with eyes." Sure
[1:21:00] you do. God gave you five outlets so you
[1:21:03] can see with these eyes. But I'm talking
[1:21:05] about a spiritual see. If God don't show
[1:21:07] it to you, then you won't see it.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; Let me finish this. So I pulled the
[1:21:16] sister to the side. I said like, "Lord
[1:21:18] have mercy." I was like, "Lord have
[1:21:20] mercy." And I look back at the pastor. I
[1:21:24] was like, "Man, I'm getting in trouble."
[1:21:26] And the pastor just looking at me with a
[1:21:30] look on his face that that that that uh
[1:21:32] uh uh a artist couldn't paint. So I knew
[1:21:36] something was going on. Now the Holy
[1:21:38] Spirit is is is is a discerner. The word
[1:21:42] is a discerner
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; of the heart,
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; right? It is EARNED A THOUGHT. THAT'S
[1:21:48] how really it live. A lot of people
[1:21:49] still don't believe it. You know,
[1:21:52] SOMEBODY ASKED ME SUNDAY. They said, "I
[1:21:55] I I preach a message." I said, "We're
[1:21:57] turning a corner." And somebody told
[1:21:59] another brother say, "Brother children
[1:22:00] must watching that brother from
[1:22:02] Trinidad." I said, "No, I don't even
[1:22:04] listen at other preacher." The most
[1:22:05] preacher I listen at, I probably listen
[1:22:07] at my pastor. Don't get wrong now.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; And I will listen at the message of the
[1:22:11] hour.
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? Because a lot of
[1:22:14] time when I when I listen at ministers
[1:22:17] and when I go to that church, it'll be
[1:22:20] direct target what someone just
[1:22:22] preached.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? So if brother Matt
[1:22:26] was preaching uh uh Sunday night and he
[1:22:30] would say, "Brother, you need to do such
[1:22:32] and such with your wife." And I come
[1:22:35] right in here and me and brother Matt
[1:22:37] come out the back and he got a smile on
[1:22:39] his face. Then I walk up to you and say,
[1:22:41] "Brother, you need to do such and such
[1:22:43] with your wife." The first thing the
[1:22:45] devil gonna tell you, Matt told him
[1:22:47] that.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; BUT SEE, THE HOLY SPIRIT IS A DISCERNER.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? So I said, the first
[1:22:54] thing the devil want to do, I said,
[1:22:56] "Sister, first thing he going to do, he
[1:22:58] going to get you from out of church.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me, young people?"
[1:23:05] I said when the devil get you out of
[1:23:07] church, I said the first thing he do, he
[1:23:10] get you from around the anointing.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; Then he put a religious spirit on you.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; And a religious spirit, brother Brandis
[1:23:18] said, is five time worse than any spirit
[1:23:21] there is. Right?
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN HE PUT THAT RELIGIOUS spirit on
[1:23:25] you, then you feel like you okay. AND
[1:23:27] SOMEONE WOULD CALL YOU AND SAY, "SISTER,
[1:23:29] where you at? Or brother, where you at?"
[1:23:30] "Oh, I'm good. I'm just praying. and I'm
[1:23:32] listening that tape. That's what the
[1:23:34] devil want you. We ain't listening at no
[1:23:35] tape ministry.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; You got to have a pastor.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; I DON'T BELIEVE IN STAYING HOME AND
[1:23:42] PUSHING THE TAPE. AMEN. SOMEBODY TOLD
[1:23:44] ME, SOMEBODY TOLD ME THEY PLAYING THE
[1:23:47] TAPE. I SAID THAT'S WHAT WE GOT A
[1:23:48] FIVEFOLD MINISTRY FOR.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? They said, "No, we
[1:23:52] play the tape. We listen and that." I
[1:23:54] ain't going to get into that. I don't
[1:23:55] know why I got there, but let me tell
[1:23:56] you what. Maybe somebody else need to
[1:23:58] hear it.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:24:00] I know y'all don't push play in here.
[1:24:02] Amen. Huh? And I said, "Sister, the
[1:24:05] first thing the devil want to do? He
[1:24:06] want to get you out. Then you going to
[1:24:08] get religious."
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; And you know what I told her? She had
[1:24:10] long beautiful hair like you. I said,
[1:24:12] "The first thing he's going to take you
[1:24:15] when you get from out of the church from
[1:24:17] under to protection." I said, "The first
[1:24:20] thing he going to take you straight to
[1:24:21] the barberh shop."
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; Huh? I said, "You're going straight to
[1:24:30] the barber shop." I said, "From the
[1:24:31] barber shop?" The old Oh, he ain't
[1:24:33] finished with you. You going on a You
[1:24:34] going on a tour from the barberh shop?
[1:24:37] You going where?
[1:24:41] You going straight to the department
[1:24:43] store and you going in the section where
[1:24:45] the men's britches are.
[1:24:49] And then he gonna put pants on you. Are
[1:24:51] you hearing me?
[1:24:53] [snorts]
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; People, you know, you said, "Brother
[1:24:55] children, why should you preach stuff
[1:24:57] like that? We in the medicine. Let me
[1:24:58] tell you what, church. I've seen I've
[1:25:00] seen I've I've seen and and I I I
[1:25:04] remember I've been at this church and
[1:25:06] this sister every time she get ready to
[1:25:07] sing, she tell one of the most beautiful
[1:25:10] testimony almost make you want to cry
[1:25:12] and and you know she just got a long
[1:25:14] testimony. Then she get long beautiful
[1:25:16] hair and long beautiful dress. But as
[1:25:20] soon as she left the message, the first
[1:25:23] thing she did, Amen, she cut her HAIR
[1:25:26] AND SHE PUT ON PANTS. NOW, the first
[1:25:28] thing the devil would do with THE YOUNG
[1:25:30] PEOPLE, FIRST thing he carries them to
[1:25:32] the barberh shop from the next THING HE
[1:25:34] PUT THEM ON PAN AND THE NEXT THING Y'ALL
[1:25:36] KNOW WHERE HE GO, HE CARRY YOU STRAIGHT
[1:25:38] TO THE TATTOO HOUSE.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; AH, do you love the Lord tonight?
[1:25:46] Hallelujah. But guess what, church? When
[1:25:49] I said that to that sister and she sat
[1:25:51] down, I just kept on preaching. I won't
[1:25:54] go into all of it. But after the
[1:25:55] service, the pastor looked at me and we
[1:25:57] went in the back and I was just I mean
[1:26:00] the anointing was still in the back and
[1:26:02] I just sat back there and I tears in my
[1:26:05] eye. When I finally calmed down, he says
[1:26:07] he said, "Brother Chis," he said, "I got
[1:26:09] something to tell you." I said, "What's
[1:26:10] that?" He said, "You know the sister
[1:26:12] that you told to stand up?" I said,
[1:26:14] "Yes." He said that sister family just
[1:26:17] left the church a few weeks ago and and
[1:26:20] her sister just left and they say the
[1:26:23] message ain't right and the first thing
[1:26:25] she did was cut her hair and she told
[1:26:28] her sister said girl you need to cut
[1:26:30] your h your hair is too long and she was
[1:26:33] just about to cut her hair but let me
[1:26:36] tell you what church let me tell you
[1:26:37] what I believe THE LORD LOVE SO I WENT
[1:26:40] BACK TO THAT CHURCH A FEW WEEKS AGO and

[1:26:45] CAME BACK and she had me to talk to her
[1:26:47] father and I be TO TALK WITH HER FATHER
[1:26:50] AND I I SAID BROTHER WHAT ARE YOU doing
[1:26:52] he said well we home now we listen that
[1:26:55] taped I said brother that is not going
[1:26:56] to work I don't know why I'm on that for
[1:26:58] I said brother that is not going to work
[1:27:00] I said let me tell you something brother
[1:27:02] you're going to answer for your wife I
[1:27:04] said you home LISTEN THAT TAPE I SAID
[1:27:07] YOU NEED TO GET HER back in CHURCH AND
[1:27:09] SHE STARTED CRYING AND THE NEXT SUNDAY
[1:27:11] THEY WAS BACK IN CHURCH OH PRAISE THE
[1:27:14] LORD
[1:27:14] SEE WHEN HE COME HE WANT TO FIND FAITH.
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; But they follow Jesus.
[1:27:23] They follow Jesus.
[1:27:25] Let me hurry with this. Hurry up. They
[1:27:28] follow Jesus. His first and second pull.
[1:27:32] But when it got to his third pull of his
[1:27:33] ministry,
[1:27:35] what he do was church, he started
[1:27:39] telling them, "Can y'all eat my flesh
[1:27:43] and drink my blood?"
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; What they did? They walked away.
[1:27:49] That was the third pull of his ministry.
[1:27:51] They walked away. They didn't want
[1:27:54] anything to do with him, right?
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; They they put him away. They got upset
[1:28:00] with him.
[1:28:02] They they they should start closing the
[1:28:04] church door. Have y'all ever seen
[1:28:06] something like that happen in this
[1:28:07] generation? They start closing the
[1:28:09] church doors. They didn't want Jesus
[1:28:11] back anymore. Amen. So, it got to a
[1:28:14] place, long story. Let me HURRY UP. YOU
[1:28:17] KNOW, GOT TO A PLACE WHERE THEY DIDN'T
[1:28:19] WANT him no more and they they they they
[1:28:22] killed him. Are you hearing me? But it's
[1:28:25] one thing about the love of God. IF YOU
[1:28:27] A PART OF GOD, GOD GONNA GET YOU ONE WAY
[1:28:31] OR OTHER. AND I THANK GOD FOR HIS GRACE
[1:28:34] IN THIS HOUR, BROTHER YOUNG. I THANK GOD
[1:28:36] FOR HIS GRACE. BECAUSE IF IT WASN'T FOR
[1:28:38] THE MERCY OF THE GOOD LORD, I WOULD
[1:28:41] STILL HAVE BEEN A LOST RANKED CHRISTIAN.
[1:28:44] AMEN. I WOULD HAVE STILL BEEN IN CHURCH
[1:28:46] SHOUTING, SPEAKING IN TONGUE, AND JUST
[1:28:49] GOING TO CHURCH AND READY FOR A TIME
[1:28:51] FIRE. BUT I THANK GOD FOR THE GRACE IN
[1:28:54] THIS HOUR, WHAT HE DID FOR ME, AND I'M
[1:28:56] HAPPY ABOUT IT.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN THEY KILLED HIM, CHURCH, WHEN
[1:29:01] THEY CRUCIFIED HIM, WHAT DID HE DO,
[1:29:03] CHURCH? HE GAVE UP THE GHOST. HE DIED
[1:29:07] AND HE WENT BACK TO WHAT HE WAS FROM THE
[1:29:09] BEGINNING,
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; a pillar fight, right? BUT THEN HE CAME
[1:29:13] BACK ON THE DAY OF PENTECOST, NOT AS SON
[1:29:16] OF MAN. HE COME BACK AGAIN WHAT? AS SON
[1:29:19] OF GOD,
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? OVER THE CHURCH AGES, RIGHT? THEN
[1:29:23] THE SON OF GOD, THAT PILLIFY WAS THE
[1:29:25] ANOINTING,
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? THAT PILLAR FIRE WAS THE
[1:29:29] ANOINTING.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; But I thank God, Brother Youngs, God
[1:29:34] opened my eyes. You know, a lot of
[1:29:37] people got they have problem, you know,
[1:29:40] when you call the prophet name. I don't
[1:29:43] have a problem.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[1:29:48] Now, now I can say, brother Matt, I I've
[1:29:52] seen where people think if they just
[1:29:55] quote
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; that's going to make them important.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; The devil will beat your brains out.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; You know, Brother Ys, a long time ago,
[1:30:05] you know, when we was coming up in
[1:30:06] Pentecost, brother, before you could be
[1:30:08] a minister, you had to learn how to
[1:30:09] quote the Bible, huh? I mean, we started
[1:30:12] quoting at a young age. I mean I when I
[1:30:14] get to Genesis and Exodus and Leviticus,
[1:30:17] Numbers and Deuteronomy, Joshua, Jud,
[1:30:19] Ruth, first, second, Samuel, 1, second,
[1:30:21] King, Israel, Nehemiah, Extra, Joel,
[1:30:23] Songs, Proverb, and Ecclesiastes and
[1:30:26] songs of Solomon, Isaiah and Jeremiah
[1:30:28] and Lamentation, Ezekiel. Woo boy, he's
[1:30:31] a man of God. I can do all that quoting
[1:30:33] and can't even love my wife.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; Woo, that's a deep preacher there, boy.
[1:30:40] I want to grow up like him. No, you
[1:30:41] don't. You be like Jesus. SO WHAT I'M
[1:30:44] TRYING TO SAY, YOU CAN SPIT OUT ALL THE
[1:30:46] QUOTES you want. IF YOU AIN'T GOT A LIFE
[1:30:49] BEHIND IT, YOU ARE WASTING YOUR TIME,
[1:30:51] MAN. LET IF I QUOTE SOMETHING, LET ME
[1:30:54] HAVE A REVELATION OF WHAT I'M QUOTING.
[1:30:57] ARE YOU HEARING ME IN THIS HOUR? SO IN
[1:30:59] JESUS MINISTRY, AMEN. HE COME BACK TO
[1:31:02] OVER THE CHURCH AGE as son of God. And I
[1:31:06] was telling somebody the other day,
[1:31:08] y'all, y'all ride with me? Y'all ride
[1:31:09] with me? I was talking to somebody the
[1:31:11] other day and when I was talking with
[1:31:14] them, uh, brother brother brother
[1:31:17] brother brother brother brother brother
[1:31:17] brother brother brother brother brother
[1:31:17] brother brother brother brother brother
[1:31:17] brother brother brother brother
[1:31:22] I was telling them and I was talking
[1:31:24] about the son of man the spirit of the
[1:31:27] spirit of God the spirit of Christ and
[1:31:29] the minister looked at me he said what
[1:31:31] he said don't tell me you going to say u
[1:31:36] uh that was Jesus in revelation
[1:31:41] I said, "What do you mean? I thought you
[1:31:44] were calling William Brandham Jesus
[1:31:46] Christ."
[1:31:48] I said, "Come on, bro."
[1:31:54] I said, "But what was when he came back
[1:31:57] on the day of Pentecost?
[1:31:59] Was it the true pill of fire?"
[1:32:02] Huh?
[1:32:04] same pillar of fire that Moses saw.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; The same pillar of fire that Paul met on
[1:32:08] the road to Damascus. And I believe it's
[1:32:11] the same pillar of fire that came in our
[1:32:13] generation. Right?
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; So it was a pillar of fire which was the
[1:32:16] anointing. It was over the church. A it
[1:32:19] was a true pillar of fire that was with
[1:32:21] Paul. Right? The same pillar of fire
[1:32:23] that with Irene and Martin and so on. I
[1:32:26] said now brother I said that anointing
[1:32:29] when it fell it fell on the seventh
[1:32:32] angel. Right? And the Bible said unto
[1:32:34] the angel of the church of what? Leia.
[1:32:38] Right? So I asked the brother I said I
[1:32:41] said now when the angel of revelation
[1:32:45] three and verse 20 it says what? Behold
[1:32:48] I stand at the door and knock. Right? I
[1:32:50] asked him I said
[1:32:52] I said who was that? He said that was
[1:32:54] Jesus. I said okay.
[1:32:58] I said, "Did he had robes on and long
[1:33:00] hair?" And what did he look like?
[1:33:04] He was in a vessel. Huh? But see, people
[1:33:08] don't have problem. Are y'all with me?
[1:33:10] I'm not saying nothing wrong. I'm in the
[1:33:12] Bible. Huh? Now, when when you could say
[1:33:14] Paul, it's okay. But when you say Irene,
[1:33:18] it's okay. But when you say Luther and
[1:33:20] Wesley, it's okay. But when you say
[1:33:23] William Brandon, wait a minute. You
[1:33:25] worship a man. Well, you tell me who was
[1:33:27] Revelation 3 and and and 14 and to the
[1:33:31] angel of the church of Leosa. NO, THAT
[1:33:35] WAS NOT JESUS CHRIST, BUT IT WAS THE
[1:33:38] ANOINTING THAT WAS UPON HIM. Are you
[1:33:40] here? Are we y'all with me? But see,
[1:33:43] PEOPLE CAN'T SEE THAT. SEE, LET ME TELL
[1:33:45] YOU, CHURCH, A LOT OF PEOPLE, THE ONLY
[1:33:47] THING THEY COULD SEE IS God sent a
[1:33:49] prophet. God sent a prophet. The devil
[1:33:51] knows that. You got to know more than
[1:33:53] that. Let me tell you what. The the
[1:33:55] prophet of God said the messenger of
[1:33:57] Malachi 4 and Revelation 10:7 COME TO DO
[1:34:01] TWO THINGS. FIRST, THEY come to turn
[1:34:03] their hearts. How many you glad your
[1:34:05] heart been turned?
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; Oh, come on. Give me a hand raised. Oh
[1:34:09] my. You glad your heart been turned? But
[1:34:11] let me tell you what, there's a lot of
[1:34:12] people that's around this message. You
[1:34:14] know why they going back to the world?
[1:34:16] You know why they going back to
[1:34:17] Pentecost? You know why? BECAUSE THEIR
[1:34:19] HEART hasn't been turned. JUST THEIR
[1:34:22] HEAD HAS BEEN TURNED. A LOT OF people
[1:34:24] turn because they saw the miracles that
[1:34:26] brother Brandley was doing. Are you WITH
[1:34:28] ME? THEY SAW THAT ALL THESE THINGS. BUT
[1:34:30] NOW, NOW WE COMING TO THE CRUNCH NOW.
[1:34:33] AND NOW PEOPLE ARE GOING BACK BECAUSE
[1:34:35] THEIR HEART HASN'T BEEN TURNED. BUT
[1:34:37] BROTHER AND SISTER, I THANK GOD. MY
[1:34:39] HEART HAS BEEN TURNED. BECAUSE WHEN YOUR
[1:34:42] HEART IS TURNED, THEN YOU CAN SEE
[1:34:44] CHRIST. CUZ WHAT HE'S COME TO DO, HE
[1:34:46] COME TO REVEAL TO YOU REVELATION 10. AND
[1:34:49] THAT'S none other than the Lord Jesus
[1:34:51] Christ.
[1:34:56] No Jesus, he come as son of man, right?
[1:35:01] Then he's to come as son of God. Right.
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; Right. So far,
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; then he to come and to sit on David's
[1:35:09] throne. Right.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; The son of man. Then he come at son of
[1:35:14] God through the church age. Right.
[1:35:16] Right. than he to come uh in the
[1:35:19] millennium as the son of David. But
[1:35:22] because of Revelation uh Revelation 10
[1:35:26] uh uh uh Malachi 4 and and Luke 17:30,
[1:35:30] the Bible said, "As it was in the days
[1:35:33] of Noah, so shall it be in the day when
[1:35:36] the son of man is be revealed." So in
[1:35:38] other words, God has to come back again
[1:35:41] as a prophet. BUT LET ME TELL YOU WHAT
[1:35:44] NOW WHAT THEY DID AND LEO SEAL THEY
[1:35:48] DIDN'T WANT HIM ANYMORE CHURCH Y'ALL

[1:36:03] HIM ON THE OUTSIDE AND WHEN THEY PUT HIM
[1:36:05] ON THE OUTSIDE THEN GOD SAY YOU KNOW
[1:36:07] WHAT I GOT TO COME BACK AGAIN I'M GOING
[1:36:10] TO COME BACK IN THE FORM OF a prophet
[1:36:13] RIGHT IN A FORM OF PROPHET TO CALL A
[1:36:16] GROUP OF PEOPLE OUT. HOW MANY YOU SO
[1:36:17] glad about it tonight? Oh, I'm happy
[1:36:19] about IT TONIGHT. I THANK GOD THAT GOD

[1:36:24] GOD DIDN'T SEND A PROPHET, I'LL STILL
[1:36:26] BEEN IN THE SYSTEM thinking that I'M ALL
[1:36:29] RIGHT. BUT I HEARD MY name was called. I

[1:36:39] THE LIVING GOD. I FOUND OUT A LOT OF
[1:36:41] PEOPLE HAVE COME OUT OF EGYPT.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; SEE, when Moses went down to Egypt, he
[1:36:48] brought a nation from out of nation. But
[1:36:50] in this hour, the Holy Spirit is coming
[1:36:52] in this hour is to bring a a bride from
[1:36:55] out of A CHURCH. SO WHAT I'M TRYING TO
[1:36:57] SAY, ALL THOSE PEOPLE THAT COME out of
[1:36:59] Egypt, church, let me tell YOU WHAT,
[1:37:01] THEY COME OUT OF EGYPT. BUT LET ME TELL
[1:37:03] YOU WHAT, EGYPT coming out of Egypt.
[1:37:05] Brother Brown says, "Let me slow down.
[1:37:08] I'm getting too old to be wide open like
[1:37:10] this.
[1:37:11] Let me drink some water. It's all right.
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; I ain't mean to hold you long.
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; I told my wife I was going to preach
[1:37:18] long.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; Where was I, brother Matt?
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:37:36] Brother Brandon said Egypt is a type of
[1:37:40] the world
[1:37:42] or an organization.
[1:37:45] Now a lot of people have come out of
[1:37:47] Egypt but Egypt is still in them.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; We got to come completely
[1:37:57] out of the world.
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; We got to come completely
[1:38:01] out of Leosia.
[1:38:05] This is a bride age. Can I say that,
[1:38:07] brother? Huh? This is a bride age. And I
[1:38:11] believe that he's called us out to take
[1:38:13] us into a bride age. So they put him on
[1:38:17] the outside. So he come back as what?
[1:38:21] Son of man

[1:38:29] Let me Let me tell you something. Let me
[1:38:31] let me let me let me tell you something.
[1:38:33] I've been to a lot of churches that got
[1:38:35] the Hoffman head. They got these same
[1:38:37] picture. When you preach these kind of
[1:38:39] thing, they look at you like you your
[1:38:41] face is orange.
[1:38:46] So what they want? They want me to work
[1:38:48] with their emotions.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; No, they want that first and second
[1:38:52] pull. Boy, I love I You know what been
[1:38:54] happening now? I've been going to places
[1:38:56] now. I wouldn't preach at a church. I
[1:38:58] preach a message basically like that. A
[1:38:59] brother told me after church, he said,
[1:39:01] "Brother children, I thought you going
[1:39:02] to drop the hammer." You know what he
[1:39:04] want me to do? He want me to run the
[1:39:05] aisle. Just a lot of holling. Ain't
[1:39:07] saying no nothing.
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; You remember brother Brown said I was
[1:39:10] preaching and that Baptist preacher told
[1:39:12] him to say Bill to do that at funeral.
[1:39:14] Lawyer does things like that. I want to
[1:39:16] bring the word church and people DON'T
[1:39:18] UNDERSTAND. THEY so used to me running
[1:39:21] and running ALL OVER THE PLACE. IT'S GOT
[1:39:22] THE PEOPLE ALL HOOPED UP. I'M NOT COMING
[1:39:25] HERE TO GET YOU HOOPED UP. BUT I'M
[1:39:26] TRYING TO TELL YOU, HE IS GETTING READY
[1:39:28] TO TAKE A BRIDE OFF OF THIS EARTH AND WE
[1:39:32] MUST BE READY.
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; SO LET ME TELL YOU WHAT, CHURCH, IF HE
[1:39:36] DIDN'T COME, BROTHER YOUNG, WE WOULD
[1:39:38] HAVE BEEN LOST AND LAY out of seal.
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; I CAN IMAGINE THE PASTOR COMING OUT WITH
[1:39:46] A ROBE ON HIM AND THE BISHOP COMING OUT.
[1:39:49] BUT DO YOU BELIEVE CHURCH PEOPLE ARE
[1:39:51] GOING BACK TO EGYPT? ARE YOU HEARING ME?
[1:39:54] DO YOU KNOW MOSES BROUGHT THEM OUT? BUT

[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; huh? There's got to be an Ephesian.
[1:40:17] There's got TO BE A JOSHUA. THERE'S GOT
[1:40:19] TO BE A HOLY GHOST THAT'S GOING TO LEAD
[1:40:22] US IN. LOOK, I WANT TO BE LED BY THE
[1:40:24] HOLY GHOST. ARE YOU HEARING ME? LOOK,
[1:40:26] CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD, I DON'T
[1:40:28] WORSHIP WILLIAM BRANDON, BUT WILLIAM
[1:40:29] BRANDON WAS MY PROPHET. HE WAS THE
[1:40:33] PROPHET OF THIS GENERATION. AND LET ME
[1:40:35] TELL YOU WHAT, WITHOUT THAT MESSAGE, I
[1:40:38] WOULD HAVE BEEN LOST TODAY.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; BUT BY THE GRACE OF GOD, I HAD EYES THAT
[1:40:43] I COULD SEE THE REVELATION. LET ME TELL
[1:40:46] YOU WHAT, GOD SHOWED ME THE REVELATION
[1:40:48] THAT CHRIST HAD TO COME. GOD HAD TO COME
[1:40:50] back at the end.
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; Not just a spirit, but he had to come
[1:40:57] back in flesh.
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; Huh? And that's when he stepped in flesh
[1:41:02] and he began to pull out.
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; It's all right, brother Young. Y'all
[1:41:07] with me, right?
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; Think about it. Can Can I say something?

[1:43:06] Brown remember. Amen. This is what he
[1:43:09] saw in THE VISION. HE SPOKE THE WORD AND

[1:43:14] CAME BACK TO LIFE AGAIN. OH MY. BROTHER
[1:43:16] BROWN THE name went all around the
[1:43:18] world. PEOPLE BEGIN TO FLOOD THE PLACE
[1:43:20] OUT BUT IT GOT TO THE PLACE THAT LOVE
[1:43:23] THE MIRACLES.
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; SEE GOD CHANGES HIS HIS HIS GOD CHANGES
[1:43:30] HIS MATCH.
[1:43:32] GOD CHANGES HIS FORM, BUT GOD NEVER
[1:43:34] CHANGE HIS NATURE.
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY YOU GOT THE SAME HOLY GHOST
[1:43:38] THAT the early CHRISTIAN HAD OR YOU GOT
[1:43:40] THE HOLY GHOST. IT WILL IDENTIFY WITH
[1:43:42] HIS WORD.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; SO CHURCH OF LIVING GOD, THEY LOVE THE
[1:43:46] PROPHET OF GOD. OH MAN, THEY WANT to fly
[1:43:48] him all over the place.
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; They told him said, "We really love you.
[1:43:52] We really believe you a man of God. We
[1:43:55] just love you." But just kind of quiet
[1:43:57] down on you know you preaching on these
[1:43:59] women with haircut and you know this you
[1:44:02] know you called to be a prophet and you
[1:44:04] know and lay hands on brother Brandon
[1:44:05] said how can I teach them adal when they
[1:44:07] won't even learn the ABC right so they
[1:44:10] love him because of the miracles but see
[1:44:13] then it came a time in our prophet life
[1:44:15] where God began to his ministry began to
[1:44:18] be a progressive minister God began to
[1:44:21] open his eyes out and let me tell you
[1:44:22] what church I'm so happy to know that
[1:44:25] God opened his eye because God knew that
[1:44:28] I would been coming along in this dark
[1:44:30] layout of sea and age. Amen. No wonder
[1:44:32] the prophet of God said, "Amen. Things
[1:44:34] looked so bad." He said in 1977,
[1:44:38] he said, "I predict, not thus said the
[1:44:40] Lord, but I predict by 1977." And I
[1:44:44] believe, brothers and sister, it got so
[1:44:46] DARK TILL THE PROPHET of God SAW LIGHT
[1:44:48] THAT WAS GOING TO BE THE END. BUT I
[1:44:50] believe by the GRACE OF GOD, GOD PUT A
[1:44:53] LITTLE GRACE THERE BECAUSE HE KNEW THAT
[1:44:55] I WAS GOING TO COME ALONG. GOD JUST HELD
[1:44:58] BACK THE WINDS OF HELL. BUT LET ME TELL
[1:45:00] YOU, BROTHERS AND SISTER, THE AMERICA,
[1:45:02] THE WHOLE WORLD IS HANGING BY ROTTEN
[1:45:05] THREAD ANY MOMENT. GOD GOING TO SAY
[1:45:07] ENOUGH IS ENOUGH, CHURCH. THERE'S TOO
[1:45:09] MUCH KILLING. THERE'S TOO MANY RAPING.
[1:45:12] THERE'S TOO MUCH GOING ON IN A LOT OF
[1:45:14] CHURCHES. BUT LET ME TELL YOU WHAT, but
[1:45:16] I'm so thank God that he pulled us out.
[1:45:21] Are y'all happy about it?
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm I'm going to I'm coming on down.
[1:45:26] I'm not going to say I'm I'm closing
[1:45:28] now. I was preaching out of church years
[1:45:30] ago. I might have told you I preaching
[1:45:31] out of church and I preached real hard
[1:45:33] that that Sunday and the pastor he he's
[1:45:36] gone now. This elderly pastor, his wife
[1:45:38] came up, brother Matt, I was standing at
[1:45:40] the front desk right there, you know,
[1:45:42] anointed service and people praise the
[1:45:43] Lord. him and his wife walk up to the
[1:45:46] front and just look at me. And I said,
[1:45:49] "Well, praise the Lord." You know how us
[1:45:50] minister feel? We feel like we did
[1:45:51] something, right? Somebody come up for
[1:45:53] prayer. So, man, this going to be real
[1:45:54] good. So, I'm getting ready to pray and
[1:45:56] I like, "Brother, you know what you
[1:45:57] want." And he looked at her and she
[1:45:59] looked at him. He said, "Go ahead,
[1:46:00] honey." No, you go ahead. He said,
[1:46:02] "Well, brother Chisum, we just want to
[1:46:04] tell you, brother, my wife and I, we
[1:46:06] just watch you just lied in the pull
[1:46:07] pit. How you think I felt?"
[1:46:10] I said, "Excuse me?" He said, "You just
[1:46:12] sat up there and brother, you lied. You
[1:46:15] just flat lied, brother. You're a liar."
[1:46:18] I said, I said, "What I did wrong?" I
[1:46:21] said, he said, "Brother, you said you
[1:46:23] were going to stop and you kept on
[1:46:24] preaching." He said,
[1:46:29] "That broke me right there now." I said,
[1:46:31] "I'm condescending. I'm just coming
[1:46:33] down." Huh? I'm trying to watch the
[1:46:34] clock on the wall. My God, that's the
[1:46:36] time there.
[1:46:38] Lord have mercy. I'm sorry. I mean to be
[1:46:40] out here by 8:30. What time? I don't
[1:46:42] know what time I got up here.
[1:46:44] Hallelujah. Now I I I I can't preach it
[1:46:46] all, but let Oh my. How are you enjoying
[1:46:48] this right now where I am? Don't turn me
[1:46:51] off yet now. But let me tell you, church
[1:46:53] of the living God. Let me tell you what.
[1:46:54] I'm going show you important of Malachi
[1:46:57] 4.
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; Wasn't for that church, we' have been
[1:47:00] lost.
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; We would have BEEN LOST.
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; BUT BY THE grace of God, God had us in
[1:47:07] his mind. Amen.
[1:47:11] &gt;&gt; So they was flying brother Brandon from
[1:47:13] place to place but after a while his
[1:47:16] ministry start changing.
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; God start showing him more. Then I
[1:47:20] believe in 1947 I think that when the
[1:47:23] angel dropped down right. Amen. Began to
[1:47:25] tell him you going to go before monarchs
[1:47:27] and potentates and king. Then his
[1:47:29] ministry start flying around. Oh my. But
[1:47:31] after a while things start slowing down
[1:47:33] from the miracles discerning the heart.
[1:47:36] Amen. what they wanted to keep him.
[1:47:39] Brother Brandon talk about in the
[1:47:40] message end time evangelism. What they
[1:47:43] want to keep him, you know, brother
[1:47:44] Brandon was told to do the work of an
[1:47:46] evangelist. Are that that's right? To
[1:47:48] make full proof. But see, that's what
[1:47:50] they wanted. Those long Nothing wrong
[1:47:52] with that. Now, don't take me wrong.
[1:47:54] What they wanted is those long prayer
[1:47:56] lines. Are y'all with me?
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; Huh? They wanted those long prayer
[1:47:59] lines. They want someone to lay hands on
[1:48:01] them. Are you hearing me? And that's
[1:48:03] what they wanted. Sometime people don't
[1:48:05] feel like God touched them unless they
[1:48:08] could come up in a prayer line. BUT LET
[1:48:10] ME TELL YOU CHURCH, I'M NOT FIGHTING
[1:48:11] AGAINST THAT. BUT THIS IS A GENTILE AGE.
[1:48:14] WE ARE NOT JEWS. WE ARE GENTILE. THE
[1:48:17] GENTILE ACTS 10:44 THE BIBLE SAID AND
[1:48:21] PETER SPOKE THOSE WORD AND THE HOLY
[1:48:24] GHOST FELL IN THERE. WE'RE IN THE AGE OF
[1:48:26] THE SPOKEN WORD. YOU COULD be healed
[1:48:28] right there at your seat.
[1:48:32] Now, somebody said, "Whoa, whoa, whoa,
[1:48:34] whoa. Wait a minute. Now you trying to
[1:48:35] take away from prayer lines." No, I
[1:48:37] didn't say that.
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; Did I say that?
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; Paul said, "Therefore, leaving the
[1:48:41] principle of THE DOCTRINE OF CHRIST OR
[1:48:43] WATER BAPTISM or laying on the hand."
[1:48:45] BUT HE SAID, "BUT THIS WHAT WE WOULD DO
[1:48:47] IF GOD PERMIT." BUT SEE, EVERYBODY FAITH
[1:48:50] IS NOT LIKE THAT. NOW, IF PEOPLE NEED
[1:48:52] HANDS LAID ON BY GOD, I'LL BE GLAD TO
[1:48:54] lay hands on. BUT IF YOU GOT THAT FAITH,
[1:48:57] AMEN, JUST SPEAK THAT WORD AND SAID, I
[1:48:59] BELIEVE IT RIGHT WHERE I'VE SAID, I
[1:49:01] CLAIM MY HEALING RIGHT now in the name
[1:49:04] of Jesus.
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; But in brother Brandon ministry begin to
[1:49:09] change.
[1:49:12] After a while, he start seeing things
[1:49:14] different. God start dealing with him.
[1:49:16] He was talking to his his pastor, I
[1:49:18] think, and they began to tell him that
[1:49:20] something was wrong with his mind. he
[1:49:22] going to lose his mind and all of this,
[1:49:25] you know, but God had to deal with him.
[1:49:27] Y'all know this story, and I ain't going
[1:49:28] to hold you long, but as brother Brandon
[1:49:30] ministry begin to change, oh my, after
[1:49:33] his ministry began to change, but in
[1:49:35] 1962 when he had this vision uh of a
[1:49:39] visitation of angels, right, and what
[1:49:41] God was getting ready to do is change
[1:49:43] his ministry. But let me tell you
[1:49:45] church, a lot of people, amen, they
[1:49:47] didn't understand. Amen. The prophet
[1:49:49] when he turned the corner, brother
[1:49:51] Brandon said, Brother Brandon said, "You
[1:49:53] could have a stone, but it take a
[1:49:55] stonemason
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; to lay that stone."
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? Any Oh my god. Let
[1:50:01] me tell you what, BROTHER BRANDON SAID,
[1:50:03] ANYBODY COULD BROTHER BRANDON SAID,
[1:50:05] "WHAT GOOD IS IT TO HAVE A STONE AND YOU
[1:50:07] DON'T HAVE A STONEMASON?" ARE YOU
[1:50:09] HEARING ME? SO YOU WANT SOMEBODY THAT
[1:50:12] KNOW HOW TO LAY THAT STONE. ARE YOU
[1:50:14] HEARING ME? AND ANYBODY, YOU KNOW,
[1:50:17] THAT'S WHY IT TAKES IN THIS HOUR, WE HAD
[1:50:20] SOMEBODY, WE HAD A PROPHET IN THIS HOUR,
[1:50:22] HE WAS ABLE to lay this THE ST
[1:50:25] CORNERSTONE FOR THE BRIDE. HE WAS ABLE
[1:50:28] TO TURN THE CORNER. AND A LOT OF PEOPLE
[1:50:30] ARE NOT ready to turn the corner.
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; We getting ready to go home. Amen. Amen.
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; God knows. I believe with all my heart,
[1:50:42] church, we are getting close. Come on,
[1:50:44] &gt;&gt; mother. Let me tell you what. When I was
[1:50:47] looking at you, you know, I thought
[1:50:48] about you on the way coming here. But
[1:50:50] when I looked at you, when I pulled up
[1:50:51] in the yard and I saw you, I looked at
[1:50:53] you, I was saying to myself, I remember
[1:50:56] your husband. I remember some of the
[1:50:58] words he told me. But when I was looking
[1:51:00] at you when I came in, I said, "It won't
[1:51:02] be long."
[1:51:06] I believe that church
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; know people could come to church.
[1:51:12] You know people come to church and you
[1:51:14] know they said well I got the Holy Ghost
[1:51:16] but Paul said have you received the Holy
[1:51:18] Ghost?
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; Not when you believe.
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; But since you believe.
[1:51:25] &gt;&gt; What is the Holy Ghost? It's the very
[1:51:27] life of God.
[1:51:29] &gt;&gt; It it'll it'll take the world completely
[1:51:32] out of you.
[1:51:33] And in this hour, I want to know without
[1:51:37] a shadow of doubt.
[1:51:39] &gt;&gt; You know, brothers and sisters, I was
[1:51:40] preaching out of church one time, and
[1:51:42] I'm condescending. I was preaching out
[1:51:45] of church one time, and I said, you
[1:51:47] know, a lot of people, they think they
[1:51:50] going to go in off of their pastor
[1:51:53] revelation or their coattail.
[1:51:55] &gt;&gt; I was preaching at a church and a grown
[1:51:57] man came up to me. He said, "Brother
[1:51:59] Chisum, I was looking to make it off of
[1:52:02] my pastor." I said, "Brother, you'll be
[1:52:04] left right behind.
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; You got to get the revelation."
[1:52:09] &gt;&gt; How important it is is it wasn't for the
[1:52:13] grace of God in this hour. If God didn't
[1:52:16] send us a prophet in this hour,
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I heard my name being called.
[1:52:24] And what he cried out, church, come out
[1:52:26] of her,
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; my people,
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; and be not partaker of her sin. And I'm
[1:52:33] happy about it tonight, church, to know
[1:52:37] that when he come, let me tell you what,
[1:52:40] church. He brought faith.
[1:52:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:43] &gt;&gt; He brought that faith. Brother Brandon
[1:52:45] said he had done those things to elevate
[1:52:48] our faith. He brought that faith to give
[1:52:50] us rapturing faith so we could get out
[1:52:53] of here. Amen.
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; Church, this is no time to be lukewarm.
[1:52:57] This no time. You say, "Brother
[1:52:58] children, why you saying that?" I feel
[1:52:59] good. But let me tell you what, church.
[1:53:02] This is the time, if I don't say nothing
[1:53:04] else, this is the hour
[1:53:08] I believe that we need to take
[1:53:11] inventory.
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; I only say that because I feel as a
[1:53:16] musician, get ready to come up. Okay.
[1:53:20] I I want to stop, but I I feel the
[1:53:23] urgent. I want to share something with
[1:53:25] you.
[1:53:27] Hope my wife don't mind this.
[1:53:32] A few years ago, I was coming out from
[1:53:34] church and something happened.
[1:53:40] Someone
[1:53:42] things got out of order
[1:53:46] and the individual told me said they
[1:53:49] were they would kill me
[1:53:52] and we are very close.
[1:53:55] Brother was a man. We are very close.
[1:53:58] But God already showed me years ago, but
[1:54:00] I didn't know it was to this magnitude.
[1:54:03] But I say that to say this now.
[1:54:08] When the individual told me said, "I'll
[1:54:10] kill you." It messed with me real bad.
[1:54:16] I said, "How
[1:54:18] how
[1:54:20] could they ever think of something like
[1:54:22] that?"
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; But then I thought about
[1:54:26] Paul says, "All things,
[1:54:30] not something."
[1:54:32] All things work together
[1:54:34] to the good
[1:54:37] to them that love the Lord and that are
[1:54:40] called according to his purpose.
[1:54:44] See, when God called you, he going to
[1:54:45] try you. You're going to know God.
[1:54:50] And I'm going to say something.
[1:54:52] But then
[1:54:55] I rode that thing for a while.
[1:54:57] But brother Matt,
[1:55:00] God was telling me,
[1:55:02] let me demonstrate it here. Let me get
[1:55:04] up here so you all could see it. God was
[1:55:07] telling me, let it go.
[1:55:12] God was telling me, "How you going to
[1:55:14] preach perfect love
[1:55:17] on this journey? You can't have
[1:55:18] nothing." When I said nothing, I mean
[1:55:22] nothing.
[1:55:26] You talking about agape love, not just
[1:55:29] filio love.
[1:55:31] But I said, "But Lord, but Lord,
[1:55:34] Lord said, you got to let it go."
[1:55:37] This what I did, church. I let it go.
[1:55:40] This it said, "Let it go." But you know
[1:55:42] what I did? I tore part of it all.
[1:55:46] I said, "I let it God said, "No, you got
[1:55:48] to let it all go."
[1:55:52] &gt;&gt; But I fa to come I'm f to say something.
[1:55:54] And then it came to my heart.
[1:55:59] We talking about a perfect love. And
[1:56:02] brother Brandon said, "Only perfect love
[1:56:05] is going to be on the other side."
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; So my wife and I was coming home from
[1:56:09] church on a Wednesday night. It's in
[1:56:11] January, February. It was very cold.
[1:56:13] Lord is laid on my heart. Brother Matt
[1:56:15] says, "Let it go."
[1:56:18] I told my wife, I said, "Honey, I'm
[1:56:22] letting it go." She said, "What are you
[1:56:23] talking about?" And I told her, she
[1:56:25] said, "Really?" I said, "I'm letting it
[1:56:26] go." And when I forgave,
[1:56:30] I mean, when I forgave,
[1:56:33] I called the individual, the person on
[1:56:35] the phone. I said, "Look, I forgive you.
[1:56:39] It was nothing but the enemy. I know it
[1:56:42] wasn't you." and I said, "I love you."
[1:56:44] Then when I saw, I put my arm around
[1:56:47] him. I invited them to my house. But
[1:56:50] after that, God began to open up things
[1:56:53] to me like never before. It was almost
[1:56:56] like God saying, "Look, if you just
[1:56:58] trust me, if you just do what I tell
[1:57:01] you, you don't know what's waiting on
[1:57:04] the other side. First of all, you got to
[1:57:06] pass this. It's about to be a rapture.
[1:57:09] You could run the aisles and talk about
[1:57:11] Jesus all you want, but if you ain't got
[1:57:13] that perfect love, you're not going
[1:57:15] nowhere. So the Lord was telling me, you
[1:57:17] got to let it go. And that, brother,
[1:57:19] brother, pastor, after I let it go,
[1:57:22] guess what? The wonders of heaven opened
[1:57:25] up to me. God began to reveal some
[1:57:28] things to me like never before. Things
[1:57:30] I've been seen, I've never thought I
[1:57:33] could ever see. You know what? I had to
[1:57:35] let it go.
[1:57:37] And I'm going to tell you tonight,
[1:57:39] church, if there's anything on your
[1:57:41] heart that's bothering you,
[1:57:46] you don't want it on your heart.
[1:57:48] &gt;&gt; You want to let it go.
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; If if your wife, you got a problem,
[1:57:53] something happened in the past with you
[1:57:55] and husband, you got to let it go.
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; Because he is here, church,
[1:58:01] and he's looking for a bride.
[1:58:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. without spot a ranker or any such
[1:58:07] thing. You young people with me tonight,
[1:58:10] I love you tonight, young people. I have
[1:58:13] six children at the house. You know, it
[1:58:16] doesn't it doesn't matter the colors of
[1:58:19] your skin cuz when we get on the other
[1:58:21] side, we're going to be brothers and
[1:58:22] sisters
[1:58:23] &gt;&gt; like we are now. You know, I'm I'm I'm
[1:58:26] I'm telling you the truth, church.
[1:58:29] People need to examine their hearts and
[1:58:32] make sure they they have what it takes.
[1:58:35] Now, what if God would have came and got
[1:58:36] me a long time ago? I want to share
[1:58:38] something that because I feel I feel the
[1:58:40] urge to tell you that. I just want you
[1:58:42] to examine your art. I just want you to
[1:58:43] look down in your heart.
[1:58:45] I was uh y'all remember
[1:58:49] it was in the 90s and don't get me wrong
[1:58:52] now. I'm just going to preach, brother
[1:58:53] man. Y'all remember in the 90s when I
[1:58:56] think when they talking about the ferret
[1:58:58] flag? So, oh boy, where he going with
[1:59:00] that? It's okay. Y'all remember that?
[1:59:04] Okay. We was on the job. See, I I just I
[1:59:08] need to tell you truth. I'm following
[1:59:09] the Lord. I I have no choice with that.
[1:59:11] But I The Lord is trying to talk
[1:59:12] tonight.
[1:59:14] And
[1:59:16] they were talking about the federal
[1:59:17] flight. But there was this brother I'm
[1:59:20] be Jason. I'll be honest with you. There
[1:59:22] was this white guy on the job and uh
[1:59:26] when they was talking about taking the
[1:59:27] flag down, guess what I guess what I
[1:59:29] did?
[1:59:30] I walked up to him. He said he said,
[1:59:33] "You know what? The flag is going back
[1:59:35] up." You know what I did? I walked up to
[1:59:38] him. I said, "Brother, let me tell you
[1:59:39] something." I said, "That flag is coming
[1:59:41] down." I said, "You hear what I said?"
[1:59:44] He looked at me and I and I just took
[1:59:45] the fear out of his heart. I said, "The
[1:59:47] flag is coming down." You know, I almost
[1:59:50] say, "Look, we not riding on the back of
[1:59:53] the bus no more. What? What? What is
[1:59:55] going on?
[1:59:57] I'm a Christian. I'm dead from politic.
[2:00:02] &gt;&gt; I supposed to be a Christian. I What are
[2:00:05] you doing thinking like that?" You know
[2:00:07] what I did? Brother Jason, I felt good.
[2:00:13] He just He just weaning right on down.
[2:00:15] Now, I know the history of the of the
[2:00:17] flag, but see, I had the wrong spirit on
[2:00:19] me. Are y'all with me? At least I'm
[2:00:20] honest.
[2:00:22] &gt;&gt; You're my brother and sister now, but I
[2:00:24] don't tell you the truth. But I told him
[2:00:26] the flag is coming down. And I walked
[2:00:28] off. Brother Jason, when I walked off, I
[2:00:31] was bad. I put fear in him. But the Holy
[2:00:35] Spirit grabbed me in my collar and
[2:00:37] snatched me around. And I ran back to
[2:00:39] that guy and I dropped on my knees. I
[2:00:41] said, "Man, I'm sorry. What?" He looked
[2:00:42] at me like I was crazy. I said, "Man,
[2:00:43] I'm sorry. What did I just say?" I said,
[2:00:45] "Look, man, I'm not in politics, man.
[2:00:46] I'm I'm sorry." He looked at me like I
[2:00:48] was crazy. But see, God had to examine
[2:00:52] me.
[2:00:54] I had to make sure
[2:00:56] that there's nothing. Are y'all with me?
[2:01:00] &gt;&gt; I had to make sure that there was
[2:01:03] nothing
[2:01:05] in my heart.
[2:01:07] Church, I don't want to stay here.
[2:01:11] &gt;&gt; That's your phone, sister.

[2:01:17] or what what if it be a day I ain't
[2:01:19] gonna say you I don't say Jill over

[2:01:24] what if Jill was in church one night and
[2:01:27] her phone someone sent a message
[2:01:30] breaking news. What if she look on her
[2:01:32] phone and it said there's two men over
[2:01:34] in Israel just was killed laying down in
[2:01:37] the street of Jerusalem.

[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; Someone Someone was arguing with me.
[2:02:00] Musician, come on up. Someone was
[2:02:01] arguing to me. They said, "Brother
[2:02:02] Chisum, I believe it's going to be Moses
[2:02:04] and Elijah. No, I believe it it's going
[2:02:06] to be the spirit. I'm going to be I
[2:02:08] said, y'all can sit here and argue all
[2:02:09] you want. It don't make no difference to
[2:02:11] me because I ain't going to be here.
[2:02:14] I mean, you you might need to know, but
[2:02:17] see, I I don't care. Look, I'm going in
[2:02:20] a rapture.

[2:02:28] will he find faith on the earth? And I'm
[2:02:31] so happy tonight to know, church,
[2:02:34] that he brought faith. How many you glad
[2:02:36] to know,
[2:02:38] &gt;&gt; that he brought faith?

[2:03:05] &gt;&gt; that we want to be ready
[2:03:08] without a shadow of doubt.
[2:03:10] I want to make sure that my heart is
[2:03:13] right. Now, what if he were to come and
[2:03:17] I had a little bit of malice in my
[2:03:19] heart?
[2:03:21] And a lot of time we don't understand
[2:03:23] God allow the devil to come because when
[2:03:26] he comes he had to get permission from
[2:03:28] God. [music]
[2:03:29] &gt;&gt; Job had brother Brandon said Job had no
[2:03:31] idea that Satan and God had a debate on
[2:03:34] him. God was telling Satan look you
[2:03:37] could do all you want but he won't deny
[2:03:40] me. How you know the trial that you
[2:03:42] going through you ain't been tested. You
[2:03:45] know sometime you want to give up and
[2:03:47] sometime you may say you know what this

[2:10:15] Yes. Amen. Did you appreciate the word
[2:10:18] of the Lord tonight? Amen. How many just
[2:10:20] want to say, "Lord, I want to be ready."
[2:10:22] Amen. If there's any speck, even just a
[2:10:24] little bit, Lord of Levven, search my
[2:10:26] heart, oh God. You know, that's actually
[2:10:29] when David said, "Search me." I clicked
[2:10:31] on that word [music] uh this morning,
[2:10:32] actually. It means research.
[2:10:36] Research me. That's a lot. Takes on a
[2:10:38] little bit different complexity than
[2:10:40] just search me. But David was saying,
[2:10:42] "Research me, Lord." Amen. Make sure
[2:10:44] there's nothing in my heart. How many
[2:10:47] just want to make a fresh commitment to
[2:10:48] the Lord and say, "Lord, when you come,
[2:10:50] [music]
[2:10:51] I want you to find faith in my house."
[2:10:55] You want to do that, raise your hand. If
[2:10:56] you don't, don't raise it. But if you
[2:10:58] do, I'll give you the opportunity. Lord,
[2:11:00] when you come, I That's what our brother
[2:11:01] preached on. When he come, when the son
[2:11:03] of man cometh, will he find faith? Lord,
[2:11:06] I'm raising my hands to say, "Find it in
[2:11:08] me, Jesus." Amen. Don't don't, as our
[2:11:11] brother said, you know, fall asleep
[2:11:13] under the the age that we live in. Amen.
[2:11:15] As brother Chisum said, "Amen." And I
[2:11:17] just so identify with that. We're living
[2:11:19] in a in a cooling off time. Amen. And
[2:11:22] you know, Jesus said, "I' I'd rather you
[2:11:24] be I'd rather you be cold. I'd rather
[2:11:27] you be hot, but I don't want you to be
[2:11:28] lukewarm." [music] Amen. There's almost
[2:11:30] nothing worse to the Lord than a
[2:11:32] lukewarm experience, a lukewarm
[2:11:34] religion, just with dead religion and
[2:11:36] dead church and church attendance and
[2:11:38] just going through the routine. If you f
[2:11:40] find yourself in that routine to say,
[2:11:42] "Lord, let me not be in that lukewarm
[2:11:45] spirit and attitude, but let me be
[2:11:47] burning." [music] Amen. Amen. Burning.
[2:11:50] Amen. With the passion and the desire.
[2:11:52] We're just going to save time tonight.
[2:11:54] Won't have you gather. [music] Amen.
[2:11:55] Just have one request here from Sister
[2:11:58] Sarah. She says, "Please keep my father
[2:12:01] in your prayers. He's going through many
[2:12:03] personal struggles right now." Amen.
[2:12:05] This is for uh brother Dave Kaiser. Uh
[2:12:07] he's going through many personal
[2:12:09] struggles right now and my deepest
[2:12:10] desire is that he would find his way
[2:12:13] back to the Lord. Amen. Sister, we agree
[2:12:15] there. Pray that God would reveal
[2:12:17] himself to my father, break through the
[2:12:19] burdens he carries, and fill his heart
[2:12:21] with the Holy Spirit. Please also
[2:12:23] [music] pray for me that I may be a
[2:12:25] source of encouragement and that my life
[2:12:27] would reflect God's love in a way that
[2:12:30] draws my father closer to him. [music]

[2:12:34] Amen. for any lost loved ones. Amen. We
[2:12:37] want to uh be a witness there. Don't
[2:12:39] have any other needs. Maybe if you have
[2:12:41] something upon your heart, why don't you
[2:12:43] bow your heads with me? Amen. And with
[2:12:45] your head [music] bowed, Amen. Everybody
[2:12:47] just uh with your head bowed, maybe if
[2:12:49] you have a need, something you didn't
[2:12:51] get a chance to write down, why don't
[2:12:53] you show that to the Lord and just raise
[2:12:55] that hand up. Jesus, Lord, [music] we're
[2:12:58] so grateful for your word tonight. Thank
[2:13:01] you for your servant, Lord. Lord, I give
[2:13:03] you thanks for Brother Chisum, Lord.
[2:13:05] He's been through many trials, Lord, as
[2:13:07] he was sharing with me in the back. Many
[2:13:09] hard times, Lord, but I'm so grateful,
[2:13:12] Lord, as [music] a he's a servant who's
[2:13:14] stood, Lord, a time-tested memorial,
[2:13:17] Lord, who has stood for the message,
[2:13:18] stood for you, Lord, God, and [music] is
[2:13:21] not shunned, as Paul said, to declare
[2:13:23] unto us the full counsel of God. Thank
[2:13:26] you for his life, for his ministry, for
[2:13:28] his family. God, we pray firstly you'd

[2:13:41] Lord, and in his body. Lord Jesus, now
[2:13:44] for these needs that we've lifted up by
[2:13:46] an uplifted hand. My hands are up, God,
[2:13:48] identifying a need upon my heart, Lord.
[2:13:51] You know what that is. I pray, God, that
[2:13:53] [music] you would just, Lord, you you
[2:13:55] said you we don't have because we don't
[2:13:57] ask, Lord. So let us ask you tonight,
[2:14:00] Lord. You said that your our hearts may
[2:14:02] be full.
[2:14:03] I pray God for this special need from
[2:14:05] Sister Sarah. Lord [music] God, I
[2:14:08] believe you can do the supernatural,
[2:14:10] Lord, and David's life. God, we expect

[2:14:14] hour, the day and age of the restoration
[2:14:16] [music] of all things, Lord. God, and
[2:14:19] that's what you love to do. You love to
[2:14:21] break, Lord, to take the broken and mend
[2:14:23] it and repair it and restore it and
[2:14:25] rebuild it. Jesus, I pray you'd come by
[2:14:28] a supernatural, Lord, way and and just
[2:14:31] break past the barriers, Lord. Break
[2:14:33] past the darkness, Lord, and touch,
[2:14:36] Lord, David's [music] heart. I pray,
[2:14:38] God. May we see him, Lord, in this
[2:14:40] church once again with his hands raised,
