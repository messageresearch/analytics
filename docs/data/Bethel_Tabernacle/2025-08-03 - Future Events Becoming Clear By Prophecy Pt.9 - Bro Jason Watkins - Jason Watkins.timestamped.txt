[5:12] Morning everyone. God bless you. Let's
[5:14] go ahead and stand as we go to the
[5:16] scriptures. Be continuing on the subject
[5:20] of the life of Christ.
[5:22] And I know depending on how you say
[5:24] that, some people might think we're
[5:27] doing a expository preaching on the four
[5:30] gospels or that we're speaking about a
[5:33] doctrine, but we're speaking about the
[5:35] character of Christ.
[5:36] &gt;&gt; That's what our focus on this is. And
[5:40] the first scripture we're looking at is
[5:42] in
[5:45] Romans chapter 12
[5:50] and verse 9. Let love be without
[5:53] dissimulation. Abhore that which is
[5:55] evil. Cleave to that which is good.
[5:59] Be kindly affectioned one to another
[6:02] with brotherly love in honor preferring
[6:05] one another. Let's pray. Father, we ask
[6:08] ask that you be with us, Lord. That you
[6:10] take your word and write it upon the
[6:12] tablets of our hearts, Lord, because we
[6:15] know that is that's what you're doing in
[6:18] this hour, Lord. It's you're you're
[6:21] causing us to come and eat your word and
[6:24] then become that word and then speak
[6:26] that word, Lord. So, we pray, Father,
[6:27] that you would mold us and shape us into
[6:30] the image of Jesus Christ. We commit
[6:32] this time to you for your glory. We ask
[6:34] it in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you.
[6:37] You can be seated.
[6:40] So, we'll do just a little review from
[6:42] last time looking at the four loves.
[6:44] This verse uh these two verses bring out
[6:49] three of those loves. So, let love or
[6:51] let agape be without dissimulation. So,
[6:55] not fake, not falsified,
[6:58] uh not something that's a put on, but
[7:01] let it be genuine. Let it be sincere.
[7:05] Um and and then the next verse it says
[7:08] be kindly affectioned
[7:11] one to another with brotherly love. The
[7:13] word kindly uh affectioned is the word
[7:16] philos
[7:18] and it's it is speaking of a friendship
[7:22] but also of a a family love. And you see
[7:26] that that the translators translated
[7:29] stoay as affection. So that's that's a
[7:32] part of stoay family love. And then it
[7:35] says brotherly love which is the word
[7:37] we're all familiar with Philadelphia.
[7:40] So again this is speaking of of
[7:43] friendship, affection, and agape love.
[7:49] And there's another type and these are
[7:52] all three of the words for love used in
[7:56] the Greek New Testament. But there's
[7:58] another one that's kind of outside the
[8:00] Bible which they talk about aeros love
[8:03] or erotic love and that's that's a
[8:06] different kind. Uh we refer to it in
[8:09] different ways. Sometimes we speak it
[8:12] about uh in our modern culture falling
[8:15] in love.
[8:17] It is it's a temporary love. It's a love
[8:20] that's out for self pleasing and
[8:24] self-satisfaction. It's it's more it's
[8:26] it's a form of love but it is not the
[8:30] real and genuine love. Falling in love
[8:33] is a actually a process where we we in
[8:36] many ways go backwards
[8:38] um as far as in our development and in
[8:41] our mentality because we lose sight of
[8:44] the bigger picture and we're so uh
[8:47] infatuated with this this person that we
[8:50] love in front of us that we lose sight
[8:52] of things that are important and we
[8:55] thank God we have other people in our
[8:56] lives that can sometimes wake us up from
[8:59] the from the stuper of falling in love.
[9:03] It's a human. It is a human love. It's a
[9:06] selfish selfish self-centered love. If
[9:09] all your marital love is only aeros, you
[9:13] will have a miserable life because
[9:16] you're being governed by that. And
[9:17] that's what the world is. They think
[9:19] that falling in love, aos is love.
[9:23] &gt;&gt; And because of that, they're they're
[9:24] they're breaking up and finding a new
[9:27] one. And you it is it is something that
[9:30] happens in the human condition. I
[9:32] believe it's part of what God has
[9:34] designed for us to propagate the human
[9:36] race. But it isn't based on logic. It
[9:39] isn't based on wisdom. And it isn't
[9:41] based on the word of God. And that's the
[9:43] thing in maturity. We understand that we
[9:46] go through es and flows even in our
[9:48] marriage. There's times where uh the
[9:50] feelings are high and there's times when
[9:52] the feelings are low. real love re
[9:55] understands that and can operate in that
[9:59] agape love wanting
[10:02] the best and spiritual growth for the
[10:04] person that you care about the most in
[10:06] the world. So another part that we see
[10:09] about this is in Greek they go to such
[10:11] detail about love we can see and
[10:15] understand you know they have four
[10:17] different ways that you translate it the
[10:19] same word love love love in English you
[10:23] know and I'll even go into that we say
[10:26] we love Pepsi or we love Coke we love
[10:29] Starbucks we love this we love that and
[10:32] it's we don't actually love it we enjoy
[10:36] that
[10:37] &gt;&gt; Amen Real love is something different
[10:39] than what we feel about Starbucks
[10:43] or or sorry, brother Ken, Urban Brew.
[10:50] And so we use these terms and we use
[10:52] these things very very loosely so
[10:54] frequently. And I'm not trying to get
[10:56] everybody to change their mind on how
[10:58] they speak, but realize what we're
[11:00] saying and what we're thinking and what
[11:02] we're looking at helps us to understand.
[11:03] And so when we look at these different
[11:06] kinds of love,
[11:08] agape, filelio, sto aeros, we understand
[11:12] that love is ordered. There's different
[11:15] orders for love. And I'll get into this
[11:18] in more detail probably in the the next
[11:20] Sunday school. But if I if I were to
[11:24] love uh my neighbor's wife the same way
[11:28] I love my wife, something's disordered.
[11:33] Amen.
[11:33] &gt;&gt; Something's dysfunctional. Something's
[11:35] wrong.
[11:36] &gt;&gt; If I were to love another person's
[11:38] children more than I love my own
[11:41] children,
[11:43] &gt;&gt; something's out of order. Something's
[11:45] wrong. Because that I have a duty,
[11:48] right? Where's my first duty? To God.
[11:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:53] &gt;&gt; Right? Regardless of what happens around
[11:56] me, my first duty is to God. But then as
[11:59] a husband, I have another duty. And if I
[12:02] properly love my family, I will order
[12:05] myself and my life in that way. You
[12:09] know, even even to ministry or whatever
[12:12] it is, I can't put that first before
[12:15] my own family because then I disqualify
[12:18] myself for ministry.
[12:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:21] &gt;&gt; And we see that, we've seen that many
[12:22] times over the years. We see that in the
[12:24] Pentecostal church, charismatic church
[12:26] of today is they they put their ministry
[12:30] and their their their image
[12:33] first before they put their family. And
[12:34] you see they're divorced and remarried
[12:36] and they got kids here and kids there
[12:38] and it's just chaos. God's love is
[12:43] ordered.
[12:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:45] &gt;&gt; Properly.
[12:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:48] &gt;&gt; All right.
[12:50] I think we'll just and just to go into
[12:54] brother you'll you'll if you search
[12:56] agapo in the table you'll see this
[12:58] brother Brandham says felio is human
[13:00] love right and so you have three
[13:03] different kinds of human loves and and
[13:05] the interesting thing is even if you
[13:07] look at the stature of a perfect man one
[13:09] of the one of the loves that we're to
[13:12] progress into and grow in our faith is
[13:15] Philadelphia so even though that's a
[13:17] human love God wants us to grow in
[13:20] maturity and in wisdom and in
[13:22] understanding in felio love. And so even
[13:27] in those human loves, you you if they're
[13:30] ordered correctly with agape love
[13:33] permeate per permeating them and over
[13:37] basically uh uh being the foundation but
[13:41] also the overriding force that's behind
[13:43] the human loves
[13:46] then there even those three loves human
[13:48] loves are an expression of of God right
[13:53] but without God involved in these human
[13:57] loves.
[13:59] Any person, the the most evil person can
[14:03] express a form of these human loves.
[14:06] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen.
[14:07] &gt;&gt; All right. And
[14:12] when they become when they become
[14:14] disordered, that's the place where they
[14:17] become a demon.
[14:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:19] &gt;&gt; It's love, but it's actually a demonic
[14:22] form of love. But because why why would
[14:25] it become a demonic? How can love be
[14:28] demonic? Is when it it is governing you
[14:30] above the word of God.
[14:32] &gt;&gt; Agape love doesn't lay aside the word of
[14:35] God. Never does.
[14:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:37] &gt;&gt; And we'll see that as we read 1
[14:39] Corinthians 13.
[14:41] But without agape love overseeing
[14:46] and managing Felio sto aeros, these
[14:50] loves when they reach their pinnacle
[14:52] become a demon.
[14:57] &gt;&gt; And human loves all contain a kernel of
[15:01] divine love. But without proper
[15:04] governing over them, they are perverted.
[15:08] It becomes corrupted.
[15:11] And so you know we see this
[15:17] writer says love begins to be a demon
[15:19] the the moment he begins to be a god.
[15:24] And so especially we look at romantic
[15:26] love and it becomes the every the
[15:30] romantic love becomes the governing
[15:33] force behind people the driving force
[15:36] behind
[15:37] lovers.
[15:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah. What ends up happening is they
[15:40] they will sacrifice everything that's
[15:44] sane and good for the sake of this quote
[15:47] unquote love. But in fact, it isn't
[15:49] love. And when we look at it, when it's
[15:52] sacrificing everything that's true and
[15:54] right for the sake of this love, it
[15:58] actually it isn't love. It's an advanced
[16:00] form of hatred. We speak about it as
[16:03] love, but it's actually hate.
[16:07] and the the the the def the working
[16:10] definition of what love is based upon
[16:12] our modern society. Like I mentioned
[16:15] before, you you you drive down the road
[16:18] in Minneapolis, not too long, you're
[16:20] going to see signs on churches and signs
[16:22] in in uh people's yards saying love is
[16:25] love.
[16:28] Okay. What do you mean by that? Do
[16:30] homosexuals
[16:32] uh having erotic love between each
[16:34] other? Love is love. It it is not.
[16:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:38] &gt;&gt; We cannot we can't as as people with
[16:41] brains inside of our heads, I won't even
[16:43] say as Christians, people with brains
[16:45] inside of our heads that can look at
[16:47] things logically can see that not all
[16:50] quote unquote love using the English
[16:53] term is love.
[16:57] Sometimes it's flatout evil.
[17:05] We read this at the end of the service
[17:07] last week. This is brother Brandham from
[17:10] the Smeirian church age. He says, "You
[17:12] see, they could not figure out God's
[17:14] love. They thought that love meant no
[17:15] suffering. They thought that love meant
[17:17] a baby with parental care. But God said
[17:20] that his love was elective love. The
[17:22] proof of his love is election. that no
[17:26] matter what happened, his love was
[17:28] proven truly by the fact that they were
[17:30] chosen unto salvation because God hath
[17:32] chosen you to salvation through
[17:34] sanctification of the spirit and belief
[17:36] of the truth.
[17:39] He may commit you to death as he did
[17:41] Paul. He may commit you to suffering as
[17:42] he did Job. That is his prerogative. He
[17:45] is sovereign. But it is all with a
[17:47] purpose. So
[17:49] what is with a purpose? His love is with
[17:52] a purpose.
[17:55] If he did not have a purpose, then he
[17:57] would be the author of frustration and
[17:58] not of peace. His purpose is what is his
[18:01] purp what is the purpose of his elective
[18:03] love? It's that after we've suffered a
[18:06] while, we would be made perfect, be
[18:08] established, strengthened, and settled.
[18:11] As Job said, he put strength in us. You
[18:13] see, he himself suffered. He learned
[18:16] obedience by the things that he
[18:18] suffered.
[18:20] Though he were Hebrews 5:8-9, though he
[18:23] were a son, yet learned he obedience by
[18:24] the things which he suffered. And being
[18:26] made perfect, he became the author of
[18:28] eternal salvation unto all them that
[18:30] obey him. In plain language, the very
[18:33] character of Jesus was perfected by
[18:35] suffering. And according to Paul, he has
[18:37] left his church a measure of suffering
[18:39] that they too by their faith in God
[18:42] while suffering for him would come to a
[18:44] place of perfection.
[18:48] So looking at this and and understanding
[18:52] what God's love is, we understand that
[18:56] it's ordered. We understand that it's
[18:58] also for a purpose.
[19:00] &gt;&gt; And so they people the denominational
[19:03] world thinks think love means you won't
[19:06] have any problems. Everything will be
[19:08] good and easy. But in fact, that if if
[19:12] we're in a condition that God doesn't
[19:14] want us to be in, and God allows things
[19:17] just to be simple and easy for us, not
[19:19] to challenge us to grow, then it isn't
[19:22] love at all. But in fact, God's elective
[19:26] love has a function and a purpose behind
[19:30] it. When God's love is what puts us into
[19:33] situations that are difficult, that are
[19:36] painful, that try us, why why does he do
[19:40] that? So that we would grow spiritually.
[19:44] So that the inside of our being would
[19:47] turn turn from being a reflection of
[19:49] this world and be become a reflection of
[19:52] Christ. So God's love is a power or
[19:56] force that extends itself for the
[19:59] purpose of your spiritual growth. And so
[20:02] if we can understand that, that's God's
[20:04] love. So we need to have that love as
[20:08] the Bible says shed abroad in our
[20:09] hearts. In fact, in our human flesh,
[20:12] we're unable to perform agape. But when
[20:16] God, it's it's go God is love. And that
[20:20] the love of God is shed in our brought
[20:22] in our hearts by the Holy Ghost. That's
[20:24] when we can be an expression of that
[20:26] love. What is an expression of that
[20:28] love? It's a power. It's a force that
[20:31] you extend yourself for the purpose of
[20:34] other people's spiritual growth.
[20:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:38] &gt;&gt; So if God's elect, again, I'm going to
[20:40] repeat it. It bears repeating. Elective
[20:42] love, he's chosen you. Doesn't mean life
[20:46] is easy. In fact, actually, if we
[20:49] understood it right, it means the
[20:50] opposite. It means that because we're in
[20:53] this fallen flesh, this sexorn nature
[20:56] that we have,
[20:58] &gt;&gt; what ends up happening is God's going to
[21:00] say, "That's I don't accept that. I
[21:03] don't accept you leaving you in this
[21:05] condition. I accept you as you are, but
[21:08] because I accept you as you are and I
[21:10] love you, I'm going to change you and
[21:12] make you like Jesus Christ." because
[21:14] that is that is the pattern and that is
[21:17] the aim that he has for every seed of
[21:21] God that he had in his mind before the
[21:23] foundation of the world. So what what is
[21:26] he going to do? He's going to allow us
[21:27] to go through things that are difficult
[21:29] that are hard in order that we might
[21:32] grow up into him who is the head in all
[21:36] things.
[21:40] Brother Brandham, uh, skip here. And
[21:44] hear ye him. Brother Brandham says, "Men
[21:46] and women, hear me today as your
[21:47] brother. Let all your little isms and
[21:49] your little sensations drop. Find the
[21:51] love of God. I'd rather have his love
[21:54] than every gift that he's got in his
[21:55] kingdom. Give me his love." That's what
[21:58] the world is looking for today is to see
[22:00] a display of real love. It'll win souls.
[22:03] When you got love, they can call tell it
[22:06] when you got love. We got too much
[22:08] makebelieve love. We got too much love.
[22:11] Felio love trying to make it agapeoa
[22:14] love. We need a real godly love.
[22:22] &gt;&gt; And from that time, brother Brandham
[22:24] says, "Let me tell you a little secret.
[22:25] The most powerful force in the world
[22:28] isn't speaking with tongues or
[22:30] interpreting tongues or being honored by
[22:31] God to be a minister or to be evangelist
[22:33] or to be a prophet. The most powerful
[22:36] weapon that I've ever found in my life
[22:38] is love.
[22:40] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[22:41] &gt;&gt; So, think about that is you may be a
[22:44] prophet. You may have a prophetic gift.
[22:46] You may have an anointing to preach the
[22:48] word. You may speak with tongues. You
[22:49] may interpret tongues. Whatever gift you
[22:53] might have, but but the most powerful
[22:56] force behind that gift isn't the gift.
[23:00] It should be love behind the gift. And
[23:03] that's what Paul in 1 Corinthians 12:13
[23:05] and 14. That's what Paul is the point
[23:07] that Paul is trying to make is we we
[23:10] you're operating. Okay, Corinthians, you
[23:12] love it. You love operating the gifts.
[23:15] You're excited about it. You're zealous
[23:17] for it. But what is the motive behind
[23:20] it? You're trying to be seen. You're
[23:22] trying to have a position. You're trying
[23:23] to have place. You want your image to be
[23:25] right
[23:27] instead of realizing that it has to be
[23:29] the most powerful weapon that God has,
[23:31] which is love. That's what changes
[23:33] people's lives. That's what transforms
[23:36] people. That's what makes ministry
[23:37] effective is when it's done with the
[23:40] emotive and objective behind it of love
[23:44] for others.
[23:45] &gt;&gt; What is love for others?
[23:48] We just said it. A power force that
[23:50] extends itself for the purpose of
[23:51] spiritual growth. That's what love is.
[23:55] And so that needs to be our motive and
[23:58] objective behind what we do. Continue
[24:01] reading. The filio love, which the Greek
[24:02] word comes from friendship like you have
[24:05] for your wife.
[24:07] There's a difference. It'll make a
[24:09] mother for that baby run through a
[24:11] blazing fire. Her life means nothing.
[24:13] That's filelio. What will agapeo do? See
[24:16] the godly love. We must love. Divinely
[24:19] love one another. Then you don't see
[24:20] your brother's mistake. If he does make
[24:22] a mistake, you never you look over the
[24:24] top of it and you love him anyhow.
[24:27] See, that's it. Love those that love
[24:29] you. But does not the sinner the same
[24:32] thing? But love those who doesn't love
[24:33] you? That's what shows the spirit of God
[24:35] is in you. Cuz he loved you when you
[24:38] were his enemy and he loved you. And if
[24:40] that spirit's in you, it'll make you
[24:42] love your enemy as you do your friend.
[24:47] Amen. And again, remember how we defined
[24:50] love. Don't get it out of order. Don't
[24:52] get it wrong. And we'll talk about this
[24:54] later, but it isn't a feeling. It's an
[24:57] action. Amen.
[24:58] &gt;&gt; It's a purpose. It's extending yourself
[25:01] for a purpose for that other person.
[25:05] All right. 1 Corinthians
[25:07] 13, the great chapter about love. I'm
[25:11] going to we'll read through the
[25:12] scriptures and then I want to present it
[25:13] in a little uh different way. So,
[25:17] charity suffereth long. Of course, this
[25:20] is the word agape.
[25:23] And is kind. Charity envieth not.
[25:25] Charity vaunteth not itself. is not
[25:27] puffed up, doth not behave itself
[25:30] unseemly, seeks not her own, is not
[25:32] easily provoked, thinkketh no evil,
[25:35] rejoicth not in iniquity, but rejoices
[25:38] in the truth.
[25:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:40] &gt;&gt; Bears all things, believes all things,
[25:42] hopes all things, endures all things.
[25:45] And so when I when I was looking at
[25:47] this, I was thinking, okay, so there's
[25:50] two different portions to this. There's
[25:52] what love is, and there's what love is
[25:54] not. So, I thought, you know, being a
[25:57] teacher the way I am is I want to put
[25:59] this all into a uh a little page to show
[26:03] what love is and what love is not.
[26:06] Love is patient.
[26:08] Love is kind.
[26:11] Love bears.
[26:15] Love believes.
[26:18] Love hopes. Right?
[26:21] Love endures. Amen.
[26:24] &gt;&gt; Love is rejoicing
[26:26] in the truth.
[26:28] And so when we look at this is what love
[26:30] is. This is the
[26:34] this is a lot more than a feeling.
[26:38] &gt;&gt; Feeling might come after it but this is
[26:41] this is what love does.
[26:43] &gt;&gt; This is this is the action that love
[26:46] has. In America in western culture we
[26:50] say we love people. Usually we mean we
[26:51] have a feeling towards them.
[26:53] &gt;&gt; That's not agape love.
[26:56] &gt;&gt; That's most of the time at best. That's
[27:00] stoay. That's affection. It's not even
[27:02] really friendship. It's just affection.
[27:04] We have a feeling towards a person.
[27:06] That's fine. That's good. No problem
[27:09] with that. But to be governed by that is
[27:12] not the Christian life. That's not the
[27:14] life of Christ. It's good to have sto.
[27:17] It's good to have Filelio. It's good to
[27:19] have aeros if it's directed correctly to
[27:21] your wife
[27:22] &gt;&gt; or to your husband, but that is that
[27:25] isn't the life of Christ yet.
[27:29] Love is patient. I mean, the these are
[27:32] all things that's coming against
[27:34] resistance and trouble and difficulty.
[27:38] You have to bear all things. In other
[27:40] words, there's someone that's annoying
[27:42] you,
[27:44] someone that's frustrating, a cert
[27:47] situation that makes you up that would
[27:49] normally make you upset and maybe does
[27:51] make you upset. And you become angry,
[27:53] but you sin not.
[27:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:56] &gt;&gt; And you say, "Okay, I'm bearing with
[27:58] this person. They they need to grow like
[28:01] I need to grow."
[28:03] &gt;&gt; Love hopes all things. Hope is speaks of
[28:07] an earnest expectation. So, it looks at
[28:10] a person and says, "Man, they're messed
[28:12] up,
[28:14] but I'm going to pray and I'm going to
[28:16] do my best to help them. And I believe I
[28:20] believe and I have hope, earnest
[28:22] expectation that God is going to change
[28:25] them just like he changed me."
[28:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:28] &gt;&gt; Because I was a mess and sometimes I am
[28:30] a mess. Right. Right.
[28:34] &gt;&gt; All of these things don't have It's
[28:37] great to say love is
[28:39] &gt;&gt; when everything is easy
[28:42] &gt;&gt; and everybody's nice to you and we're
[28:44] living in the Garden of Eden condition,
[28:47] &gt;&gt; but this is not how love becomes
[28:49] manifested. This is every one of these
[28:51] things. You have to be patient. It's not
[28:54] hard to be patient that's some on
[28:55] someone that's waiting on your every
[28:57] need and hands you something before it
[28:59] ever comes before you ever want it.
[29:01] That's not patience. Patience is when
[29:04] someone's trying your patience.
[29:06] Someone's trying you. Someone's being
[29:08] frustrating and difficult. Rejoicing in
[29:11] the truth that would have no impact if
[29:14] there were not lies out there. If there
[29:16] was not dishonesty
[29:19] endures,
[29:21] that would have no meaning if there
[29:22] weren't suffering.
[29:24] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen.
[29:27] &gt;&gt; Love is not
[29:30] envious.
[29:32] Love is not boastful. Love is not
[29:34] arrogant. Love is not rude. Love does
[29:38] not insist on its own way. Now, that
[29:41] doesn't mean it's a pushover or a
[29:43] jellyfish. What love insists on is God's
[29:46] way, not its own way, not my will. The
[29:49] Lord's will be done.
[29:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:53] &gt;&gt; Irritable. Love is not irritable or
[29:55] resentful.
[29:56] Love does not is not rejoicing in evil.
[30:03] &gt;&gt; So we see what love is and what love is
[30:05] not. And it's manifested in a fallen
[30:07] world amongst fallen people of whom we
[30:10] are one of them. Yeah.
[30:12] &gt;&gt; And so, so this is this is God's love
[30:17] ultimately. And then when that love
[30:19] comes down into us, it's not native
[30:23] to the sinful nature.
[30:26] Filelio, Aeros,
[30:29] Sto, they're all native. You can all,
[30:32] even unbelievers and pagans can manifest
[30:36] on some level all of those types of
[30:38] love. But agape love is different. Agape
[30:43] love is coming down from above and only
[30:46] though only as a uh secondary
[30:49] manifestation can we put it on display
[30:52] because it's God operating through
[30:56] fallen
[30:58] &gt;&gt; man. Amen.
[30:59] &gt;&gt; Redeemed flesh. Let's put it that way.
[31:03] So in closing, true agape love is not a
[31:07] feeling.
[31:09] You don't fall into agape love.
[31:13] &gt;&gt; You you actually it rises up from
[31:16] within. It's not a falling. It's a
[31:18] rising up from within by the spirit of
[31:21] God that lives within you.
[31:26] It's a choice. It's not a falling. It's
[31:29] a choice. Love is only love if it's
[31:32] freely given. Just as God freely gives
[31:35] his love to us, we need to be able to
[31:38] free freely give our love to others.
[31:43] Agape love is an action that permeates
[31:47] and transcends all our human loves or it
[31:51] needs to if our human loves are to be
[31:54] ordered properly. It needs to permeate
[31:56] all of our human loves.
[32:00] It's also not a manufacturing of love. A
[32:04] sheep is not asked to manufacture wool.
[32:08] &gt;&gt; A sheep just does it automatically.
[32:12] It's something that comes forth from
[32:15] that sheep. And it's supposed it's the
[32:17] same thing with love. It should be
[32:19] something that's coming out of our
[32:22] innermost being as a fruit of the
[32:25] spirit.
[32:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:27] because it is a fruit of the spirit
[32:31] not something that we have to force
[32:32] oursel or work ourself into but that it
[32:36] by the holy spirit comes out of us un
[32:39] towards others that's actually the force
[32:41] and the power of god as we said the most
[32:44] powerful force is agape love so that is
[32:48] actually the power of god coming forth
[32:50] from our lives to extend itself for the
[32:54] purpose of other people growing
[32:56] spiritually
[32:59] I would say even not even the right hand
[33:01] knows that the left hand is doing it.
[33:03] How does that work? How do I do
[33:06] something as though my right hand
[33:07] doesn't know my left hand is doing it?
[33:08] In other words, it has to be something
[33:10] that's automatically coming out of me.
[33:12] Hey, I didn't know what happened. I
[33:15] don't know how I did that. Just the Lord
[33:16] did it. If you think about the cases of
[33:19] of divine love coming forth from brother
[33:21] Brandham towards those animals,
[33:24] it's something that just came out of him
[33:26] by the power of the spirit of God. Not
[33:28] even the right hand knew that the left
[33:30] hand was doing it.
[33:35] Romans 8:28. And we know that all things
[33:38] work together for good to them that love
[33:40] God, to them who are the called
[33:42] according to his purpose. So the called
[33:44] according to his purpose are the ones
[33:46] that have elective love placed upon
[33:48] them. And therefore we see that God is
[33:51] working in everything in their life for
[33:53] their good. What is our good? Our
[33:56] comfort? No. For our eternal good.
[34:00] &gt;&gt; So so God's love is expressed in the
[34:03] form that it causes us to grow up into
[34:07] the maturity of the word which is
[34:09] Christ.
[34:11] And as we as I am connecting this to
[34:13] love, Romans 8:35, who shall separate us
[34:17] from the love of Christ? Shall
[34:18] tribulation or distress or persecution
[34:20] or famine or nakedness or peril or
[34:24] sword? No, none of those things separate
[34:27] us from the love of Christ. In fact, in
[34:30] the midst of them, the love of Christ is
[34:32] manifested because he uses tribulation,
[34:34] distress, persecution, famine,
[34:36] nakedness, peril, and sword in order to
[34:39] cause us to grow up into Christ.
[34:43] &gt;&gt; And so, that is God's love and that is
[34:45] agape love. That's the love that we need
[34:48] to have towards one another. not a
[34:50] manufactured put on,
[34:52] &gt;&gt; but something that's coming from the
[34:54] depths of our heart and reaching out to
[34:56] others and saying, "I want to see them
[34:58] grow in Christ. I want to see them walk
[35:00] with the Lord. I want to see them
[35:02] changed and transformed. And I'm hoping
[35:04] and believing and enduring and being
[35:08] kind and not being rude and not being
[35:10] resentful and irritable. Why? Because I
[35:13] have to do it?" No, because something on
[35:16] the inside is pushing me
[35:18] &gt;&gt; for it. I'm bearing wool, not
[35:21] manufacturing it. Let's pray. Heavenly
[35:23] Father, we thank you so much for your
[35:25] word. We pray, Father, that you would,
[35:28] oh God, extend your love into our
[35:30] hearts, Lord, and through our hearts,
[35:32] Father. We commit ourselves in this time
[35:36] and the worship and the preaching of the
[35:37] word to you, Lord. Be glorified in our
[35:40] midst. We ask in Jesus name. Amen.
[35:43] &gt;&gt; God bless you, saints.
