[2:24] so
[4:17] do
[4:55] you
[6:07] um
[6:28] practical
[6:29] james a servant of god and of the lord
[6:32] jesus christ to the 12 tribes which are
[6:34] scattered abroad greeting
[6:37] my brethren count on all joy when you
[6:39] fall into diverse temptations knowing
[6:41] this
[6:42] that the trying of your faith worketh
[6:45] patience you can be seated this morning
[6:47] you could put my powerpoint up if you
[6:49] could brothers and i don't the clicker
[6:51] was here
[6:52] got it here and i'll control it
[6:56] book of james
[6:57] is some of the most practical
[6:59] christianity that you could read in the
[7:01] bible in the new testament especially if
[7:04] you want to see real true
[7:05] application
[7:07] the book of james really covers it and
[7:10] we're just going to study it just for
[7:11] this uh this morning we'll do an
[7:13] overview and then we'll break into some
[7:16] good really good teaching some solid
[7:18] teaching
[7:20] on the book
[7:21] but
[7:22] nuts and bolts we have that phrase
[7:25] we say where the rubber meets the road
[7:27] and
[7:29] you know that's just uh
[7:31] phrases that we could use to where we're
[7:33] talking about something that's realistic
[7:35] something that's very
[7:36] um just where life really is
[7:40] and when you read james that's really
[7:42] what you find you find
[7:45] a person who's
[7:46] speaking uh right where you live i mean
[7:49] right where you're at
[7:51] very realistic real living
[7:54] it's no nonsense christianity and i
[7:57] believe that we should be no nonsense
[7:59] christians there's a lot of nonsense
[8:01] christianity in the world today but
[8:03] james really
[8:05] preaches and teaches a very realistic
[8:08] christian life day to day
[8:11] to day-to-day on a day-to-day daily
[8:14] basis
[8:15] and there's not much doctrinal stuff if
[8:18] you read the entire book there's not
[8:19] really a lot of doctrine
[8:21] in the book but you know what there is
[8:23] and this is this is what's amazing when
[8:25] you study it there's not a lot of
[8:27] doctrine but there's a lot of teaching
[8:30] on behavior
[8:33] and it's incredible because when you
[8:35] look at this and and even if you just
[8:37] um you realize one of the truths
[8:41] that are one of the core truths that you
[8:43] draw from the book of james is that
[8:46] behavior
[8:48] is a vital
[8:49] vital part
[8:51] of a believer
[8:53] it's vital
[8:55] and i'll say this as vital
[8:57] as doctrine because if your doctrine
[8:59] doesn't produce behavior like christ
[9:03] then what good is your doctrine
[9:05] and so you could sum up the entire book
[9:07] of james and and uh just reading it last
[9:10] night i'm i'm just smiling at some of
[9:12] these notes that i wrote as i was
[9:14] reading it because it's incredible i've
[9:15] read portions of james but never one
[9:18] book collectively and it's incredible
[9:21] you could sum up the entire book of
[9:23] james with one word
[9:25] do you
[9:28] one word
[9:29] do
[9:30] you you'll hear that that verse that we
[9:33] know so well be ye doers of the word and
[9:36] not just hearers
[9:38] you could sum up the whole book as
[9:39] saying just do in fact if you underline
[9:43] the word do
[9:44] dio in your bible from genesis to
[9:47] revelation i think you'd be blown away
[9:50] with how many references the entire
[9:52] bible makes with the word
[9:55] do you what you'll find is that it's
[9:57] actually a key word to the entire bible
[10:00] isn't that incredible not just here but
[10:03] do what you've heard
[10:05] and i i want to say lord i want to be a
[10:07] doer
[10:09] i want to be a doer
[10:11] we underline it's incredible we
[10:12] underlined the big words in our bible
[10:14] justification and sanctification and
[10:16] revelation and
[10:18] we miss these little simple words
[10:21] and and i believe the little simple word
[10:23] do
[10:24] this is going to rhyme but i didn't mean
[10:26] it to
[10:27] the simple word do is the glue
[10:31] it's what pieces it all together because
[10:33] without it
[10:35] you just have what the bible says the
[10:37] letter killeth
[10:39] intellect kills but the spirit
[10:42] giveth life
[10:44] so you you you believe you see that do
[10:48] in james you have this challenge
[10:51] that uh and he's challenging you uh you
[10:55] and me today as i teach on this lesson
[10:57] here he's challenged challenging us to
[10:59] be not just hearers of what we've heard
[11:03] but doers of what we heard and i love
[11:05] the book when you read the entire book i
[11:08] love it because it's not it's not
[11:10] intellectual
[11:12] it's not academic
[11:15] it's not it's not a teaching there's a
[11:17] lot of things that could be taught and
[11:18] and we could look at different things
[11:20] but i love james because it's not it's
[11:23] not intellectual
[11:24] it's not loaded with intellect or how to
[11:26] be a smarter person
[11:28] you know let me say this the bible
[11:30] doesn't make you smarter
[11:32] there's a lot of books that you can read
[11:34] in this world that make you smarter the
[11:36] bible's not one of them you won't be
[11:37] smarter by reading it but you will be
[11:40] wiser and the bible doesn't give you
[11:43] intellect it gives you wisdom
[11:45] and james doesn't offer any kind of
[11:47] intellect or academic thing that you can
[11:50] learn
[11:50] but he does offer loads of wisdom and
[11:54] and it's so incredible
[11:56] i just take just a moment to make that
[11:58] point reading and learning reading
[12:00] reading and studying the bible doesn't
[12:02] make you a smarter person in fact it
[12:04] doesn't intend there's no intent to make
[12:07] you a smarter person but reading that
[12:09] brings wisdom and that's why that's
[12:11] exactly why the bible can be understood
[12:15] by uneducated people amen
[12:18] you could put this book in any country
[12:21] that doesn't have a proper education
[12:23] system and they don't they don't they
[12:24] don't they aren't taught
[12:27] but yet they can read this bible and
[12:29] they understand it
[12:31] it's the way it was written it's not
[12:34] written for the smart and the educated
[12:36] it's written for the simple minded
[12:38] people
[12:43] i think it's just i think it's profound
[12:46] it's written for the most simple minded
[12:48] person if you're filled with the holy
[12:51] spirit you'll understand the wisdom that
[12:54] the bible is trying to convey i believe
[12:56] the entire word of god is exactly that
[12:59] way that's exactly precisely why our
[13:02] brother branham was an uneducated
[13:04] seventh grade education hillbilly from
[13:06] kentucky
[13:08] because it's in line in sync with a
[13:10] bible that's made for simple people you
[13:12] have a message that's made for a simple
[13:14] group
[13:16] that has the ability to not not
[13:18] intellectually understand but believe by
[13:20] revelation what they've
[13:22] heard can you say amen
[13:24] so that's exactly why we say the letter
[13:27] killeth but the spirit giveth life
[13:30] and so we look at this book of james and
[13:32] we're just going to cover just a few
[13:33] minutes of this
[13:35] who is this man james
[13:38] that wrote the book now
[13:41] after study you would find
[13:43] that most uh most all
[13:46] scholars of the bible agree that there
[13:48] were three men named james some say five
[13:50] but really you can limit it down or
[13:52] narrow it down to the the scriptures
[13:54] referring to three different men
[13:56] you have and i got to some of these on
[13:58] the screen here don't have control so
[14:00] you can just advance it this is the one
[14:04] that we read the most about in the
[14:05] gospels this is james
[14:08] the son of zebedee and we'll just cover
[14:10] these just quickly you have james the
[14:11] son of zebedee you also the bible refers
[14:14] to i don't have it on that's why it
[14:16] don't work
[14:17] let me go back good
[14:20] so you have james the son of zebedee and
[14:22] then you have james the son of alphaeus
[14:25] the bible refers to and whether these
[14:27] pictures are real representations um
[14:29] well i'll leave that up to you guys but
[14:31] they were good on google and they look
[14:33] good
[14:34] james also the last james you read about
[14:37] is james the brother of jesus
[14:41] and we're going to say a lot about him
[14:42] this morning and look just into the
[14:44] inner circle or the inner
[14:46] immediate family
[14:48] of jesus because this is where you find
[14:50] james when we read the book of james and
[14:52] also the book of jude
[14:55] brother of jesus it's incredible two of
[14:57] his brothers or you could say half
[14:59] brothers became authors
[15:02] of new testament gospels so james is
[15:05] given three different times you'll find
[15:06] this james the son of zebedee and this
[15:08] is probably the most
[15:10] prominent james that you read about and
[15:13] i'm not going to have them turn so if
[15:14] you had a but if you have a bible you
[15:16] can just turn quickly to matthew chapter
[15:18] 10 and we'll look at just verse 2.
[15:21] as i said we're just going to do an
[15:22] overview not really able to get into a
[15:24] lot of these this is really uh sunday
[15:27] school should be a we only have 30
[15:29] minutes so it's a good way to entice you
[15:32] to go home and read and study the word
[15:35] uh matthew chapter 10
[15:38] and we'll just read verse two and i'm
[15:40] gonna read some of these and
[15:42] if we get if you can catch up while i
[15:44] read them good if not we'll just move to
[15:46] the next now the names of the twelve
[15:48] apostles are these the first simon who
[15:50] is called peter and andrew his brother
[15:53] james the son of zebedee
[15:56] and john
[15:58] his brother
[15:59] so here's the two brothers james and
[16:02] john and you'll find this mentioned in
[16:04] matthew mark luke and john
[16:06] and you find that james this man james
[16:09] works with his brother john and with his
[16:12] father zebedee the scripture says that
[16:14] in matthew and references it and also he
[16:16] works with simon peter so here's a trio
[16:20] that you find all the way through the
[16:22] life of jesus you'll see these three men
[16:25] almost an inner circle
[16:28] to jesus it's incredible really when you
[16:30] if you read your bible and especially if
[16:33] you've watched the chosen
[16:35] it's incredible
[16:36] just the
[16:37] 3d
[16:38] look that you get when you really look
[16:41] at the human side of the family or the
[16:45] apostles and their families
[16:47] and you'll find they were just ordinary
[16:49] people
[16:51] nothing special about them
[16:53] uh
[16:54] in society necessarily but jesus found
[16:57] something very special inside of them
[17:00] and so you see this he's with simon
[17:02] peter james john and peter
[17:06] um and they you'll find that they all
[17:08] fished these are the men who fished
[17:10] together had a business
[17:12] uh of fishing and james is mentioned in
[17:15] that group they were all followers of
[17:17] john the baptist as most of the er
[17:20] disciples were followers of john
[17:22] originally
[17:23] and so you see that he he john in
[17:26] matthew chapter 4 verse 18 it says in
[17:29] jesus you can read this if you have it
[17:31] just as matthew 4 verse 18.
[17:34] and jesus walking by the sea of galilee
[17:36] saw two brethren simon called peter and
[17:38] andrew his brother casting that into the
[17:40] sea for they were fishers and he said
[17:42] unto them now
[17:43] it's it's amazing because you'll see
[17:45] this reference let me just pull it up
[17:47] here matthew 4
[17:50] and i'll have it here in just a second
[17:52] it's incredible and let's just look at
[17:54] verse 18 again
[17:57] and jesus walking by the sea saw two
[17:58] brethren simon called peter and his
[18:00] brother and andrew's brother casting
[18:02] into the sea for they were fishers he
[18:03] said to them follow me and i will make
[18:05] you fishers of men and they straight
[18:08] away left their nets and followed him
[18:10] and going on from thence he saw
[18:12] other two brethren james the son of
[18:14] zebedee and john his brother in a ship
[18:17] with zebedee their father mending their
[18:19] nets
[18:20] and he called them so the bible is going
[18:22] to start referencing james the son of
[18:25] zebedee and then you'll see james the
[18:27] son of alphaeus and then james the
[18:29] brother of jesus
[18:30] and it's just and you'll you'll find in
[18:32] one place and some you may have been
[18:34] confused by this before you'll see john
[18:37] the lesser you've read that in your in
[18:39] your in your bible john the lesser and
[18:41] then the chosen they've called james big
[18:44] james say why is it why are they
[18:46] referring to him as big james because
[18:47] the scripture was using a way to
[18:49] separate there was a difference these
[18:51] were two different men and lesser could
[18:53] mean that he was younger it could have
[18:55] been that he was
[18:56] shorter
[18:58] maybe not as tall as big james i'm not
[19:00] really sure i don't think it really
[19:01] matters
[19:02] but so you see here that
[19:05] jesus it's incredible these three men
[19:07] james john and peter because when jesus
[19:10] prays all night in luke chapter 15 we'll
[19:12] just read it quickly luke chapter 15
[19:14] verse 12
[19:16] when he prays
[19:19] in verse 12 and the younger of them said
[19:21] to his father
[19:23] i have i have the wrong reference here
[19:25] forgive me
[19:27] yeah and the younger them said to his
[19:28] father this is correct
[19:30] and and and so he this is when jesus is
[19:33] going to go and pray all night so he
[19:35] chooses 12
[19:36] disciples and and and james is the third
[19:39] man mentioned after peter and his
[19:41] brother andrew immediately before john
[19:44] and he calls them james and john and
[19:46] you'll see this reference in mark
[19:48] chapter three let's just pick that up
[19:50] quickly mark chapter 3 i do want to read
[19:52] this one forgive me i got a lot of
[19:54] references here and i want to make sure
[19:56] i don't read ones that will take time
[19:58] uh too much time mark chapter 3. look at
[20:01] this here in verse 17.
[20:04] let's just begin reading at verse 15 and
[20:06] to have power to heal sickness and to
[20:07] cast out devils and simon he surnamed
[20:10] peter
[20:11] and james the son of zebedee and john
[20:13] the brother of james and he surnamed
[20:16] them
[20:17] now how you pronounce this i don't know
[20:19] uh
[20:20] bowen air just i don't know how you say
[20:22] it correctly but this is a name that he
[20:24] gave
[20:26] james
[20:27] and john
[20:28] looking look further which is the sons
[20:32] of thunder
[20:34] so this is a nickname that jesus gives
[20:37] these two men james and john
[20:40] the sons of thunder and you say why
[20:42] would he call them
[20:43] james and john the sons of thunder well
[20:46] it becomes really obvious to me
[20:49] in luke chapter 9 when they're passing a
[20:52] group of samaritans and the samaritans
[20:54] don't want to accept jesus and james and
[20:56] john look at him and say master should
[20:58] we call down fire from heaven right now
[21:00] and destroy the whole city
[21:03] there's a lot of preachers that way too
[21:07] should we just
[21:08] rain down fire and brimstone and just
[21:10] destroy the entire thing so that's jesus
[21:12] gives them they have this they have a
[21:14] fiery temper just quick to the draw
[21:16] quick to the temper but you know what's
[21:18] amazing is that you'd say but that's a
[21:20] character flaw well jesus doesn't
[21:22] separate them he doesn't say i'm just
[21:23] going to replace you he actually brings
[21:25] that character flaw within his circle
[21:29] these were men in his inner circle and
[21:31] says you're the sons of thunder and god
[21:34] made you that way specifically for a
[21:36] reason and i can use that quality
[21:38] refined by the master
[21:40] i can use it so he calls the he calls
[21:43] them this is the same james james the
[21:45] son of zebedee and so he he brings peter
[21:48] james and john
[21:50] when he goes to mount transfiguration in
[21:52] matthew 7 17
[21:54] he doesn't call all the disciples he
[21:57] just calls these three men
[22:00] james
[22:01] john
[22:02] and peter
[22:04] you also find that in in mark 9 and luke
[22:08] chapter 9
[22:09] they were the only three present when
[22:13] jesus raises jarius's daughter
[22:16] amen the only three isn't that
[22:18] incredible
[22:20] he
[22:20] he puts everybody else out and he brings
[22:23] in
[22:24] three something unique or special
[22:28] about these three men
[22:31] um in the garden of gethsemane
[22:33] and you you know that story very well
[22:36] where jesus goes and then he prays and
[22:38] they're falling asleep and he says can
[22:40] you not pray with me just a little while
[22:41] and then he goes the bible says and he
[22:43] goes further into gethsemane and he
[22:45] calls as he goes deeper in gethsemane it
[22:48] ends up that it's only james john and
[22:51] peter who are with
[22:52] him and and so
[22:57] we're we don't have time real i've got
[22:59] so many notes here and i just won't have
[23:00] time to cover them all
[23:02] and so it's a it's incredible when you
[23:04] look at this man james the son of
[23:07] zebedee his life is a very short one
[23:10] after
[23:11] jesus ascends in acts chapter 12
[23:14] the the bible tells us that
[23:18] herod stretched forth his hand and
[23:20] killed james he was actually the first i
[23:22] believe the first
[23:23] apostle the first disciple
[23:25] to be martyred
[23:27] and his life is very short
[23:29] means he was the first one
[23:32] he was the first one back with the lord
[23:35] so then you you move on from this james
[23:37] to james the son of alphaeus and i want
[23:39] you to look at matthew chapter 10
[23:41] matthew chapter 10 quickly we look there
[23:43] we're going to look just again
[23:44] quickly
[23:46] uh matthew not mark matthew chapter 10
[23:50] make sure i got my scripture right
[23:53] yeah
[23:54] now these names of the twelve tribal
[23:56] apostles are these the first simon this
[23:58] is verse two it's called peter anders
[24:00] brother james the son of zebedee john
[24:01] his brother philip verse 3 philip and
[24:04] bartholomew thomas and matthew the
[24:05] publican now here's another james james
[24:09] the son of alphaeus
[24:11] so as the scripture references a
[24:13] different james here james the son of
[24:15] alpheus and and we know his father that
[24:18] that speaking of his father his father's
[24:20] name was alpheus and apparently his
[24:22] mother's name was mary we find that in
[24:24] mark chapter 16 and it says and when the
[24:28] sabbath was past mary magdalene and mary
[24:31] so you have two mary's the brother of
[24:33] james and salmon had brought sweet
[24:35] spices that may come in and so here's
[24:37] this other man
[24:39] james the son of alphaeus whose mother
[24:42] is mary and he's called james the less
[24:45] let's look at that in mark chapter 15
[24:48] verse 40. mark chapter 15
[24:51] and we'll look at verse 40.
[24:54] make sure i have that right i do
[24:56] it's just script good scriptural
[24:57] references for you
[25:02] verse 40. there were also women looking
[25:04] on a far off among whom was mary
[25:06] magdalene
[25:07] and mary the mother of james the less so
[25:11] there it is
[25:12] the mother of james the less
[25:15] and so here his here's again is his
[25:18] reference differentiating him
[25:20] uh from james or big james or james the
[25:23] greater james the son of zebedee and so
[25:26] james the son of alphaeus
[25:29] is
[25:30] almost unknown
[25:32] his name is mentioned as an apostle but
[25:34] the the gospels there's not any really
[25:38] description of his character or what
[25:40] type of man he was or how he was called
[25:42] just that he was called it's not a lot
[25:44] recorded in the scripture he's mentioned
[25:47] as being in the upper room
[25:49] uh when the holy ghost falls in the
[25:51] their space the cloven tongues cover
[25:53] them and they speak in an unknown
[25:54] language
[25:56] james the son of alphaeus is mentioned
[25:58] there when they're waiting for the
[26:00] promise of the father
[26:02] in acts chapter one you'll find that and
[26:04] then after
[26:05] pentecost he just there's nothing else
[26:07] really recorded
[26:09] of james and some of some of uh some
[26:12] have have identified him as as james
[26:15] this and him and the brother of jesus
[26:17] were the same well that's impossible
[26:18] because actually the bible says jesus's
[26:21] brothers
[26:22] didn't believe in jesus
[26:24] when he was in his earthly when he was
[26:26] in his ministry until after the
[26:27] crucifixion none of his brothers
[26:30] believed in him
[26:31] or his sisters
[26:33] the bible records that and we're going
[26:34] to read that here in a minute they
[26:35] didn't they didn't accept him at all so
[26:36] it couldn't be the same james because
[26:38] this james is called prior to the
[26:40] crucifixion and it's incredible when i
[26:43] thought about this because
[26:45] not all the apostles who were called
[26:48] made
[26:49] had had something written necessarily
[26:51] about their life but some did and others
[26:54] didn't but here's what was important
[26:57] they were called
[26:58] and that was enough
[27:00] to get their name written in the bible
[27:03] and you may never do anything in this
[27:05] life or this world that makes some no
[27:07] some you know some paper or some
[27:09] facebook post
[27:11] or some youtube video
[27:13] you ought to google your name sometime
[27:14] you'd be shocked at what's on there
[27:17] but if you're called and you're chosen
[27:20] that's enough
[27:22] can you say amen
[27:23] several of the apostles aren't mentioned
[27:26] after acts chapter one then you have the
[27:28] final one james
[27:30] the brother of jesus
[27:34] and this james wasn't one of the 12
[27:38] but he was
[27:39] the brother to jesus in the flesh
[27:42] so he's had the same
[27:43] james's or this james mother
[27:46] was mary
[27:49] and so we know mary wasn't a virgin
[27:51] after jesus
[27:53] right so we we believe in mary we
[27:55] believe she's blessed the bible says and
[27:57] i'll call her blessed mary because the
[27:59] bible says you'll be called blessed for
[28:01] all generations but we won't exalt her
[28:03] and put her in a pedestal or position
[28:05] right
[28:06] it's incredible when the if you look at
[28:09] catholicism and the way that they've
[28:11] exalted mary
[28:13] and put her on it put her at such a
[28:15] place that the bible doesn't
[28:18] but i think it's important sometimes
[28:20] because we have a we have a tendency as
[28:22] humans to be a seesaw right
[28:25] if we see something off so far in this
[28:27] direction we go the complete opposite
[28:29] way oh mary's nothing well actually no
[28:32] mary was a very special woman
[28:35] lived a very unique special life
[28:38] remarkable to be the mother of jesus
[28:41] and james isn't one of the 12 he's one
[28:43] of the four brothers of jesus mentioned
[28:47] uh in matthew chapter 13. quickly we're
[28:49] running out of time so matthew chapter
[28:52] 13. let's just look at that
[28:54] as we can
[28:56] matthew chapter 13 verse 54 all the way
[28:59] down to the very end there
[29:04] we can just begin reading and when he
[29:06] was coming to his own country he taught
[29:07] them in their synagogue in so much that
[29:09] they were staunch and said whence hath
[29:11] this man this wisdom and these mighty
[29:12] works is not this the carpenter's son
[29:15] is not his mother called mary and his
[29:18] brethren james there he is
[29:21] and joseph and simon and judas and his
[29:24] sisters
[29:25] are they not all with us whence then has
[29:28] this man all these things and they were
[29:30] offended to him but jesus said unto them
[29:33] a prophet is not without honor saving
[29:35] his own country in his and his and in
[29:38] his own house and he did not many mighty
[29:41] works because of their unbelief
[29:44] that's and that's just that's a that's a
[29:46] sermon in and of itself right there a
[29:49] prophet is not without honor in other
[29:50] words a prophet has honor except in his
[29:52] own country and it's incredible because
[29:55] because they
[29:56] did not believe
[29:58] in jesus the bible says he couldn't do
[30:01] many mighty works there
[30:03] do you realize how much your belief
[30:06] limits the lord jesus from doing
[30:08] something in your life when you can't
[30:10] see god behind skin in ministry and
[30:13] parents and mothers and fathers and
[30:15] sisters and brothers
[30:17] the lord can't do much
[30:19] because you've got to believe first can
[30:21] you say amen
[30:23] and so he's he's
[30:26] i just want to have five minutes
[30:28] and i'm not the song leader so i don't
[30:30] want to get in trouble with brother tony
[30:32] so let me just wrap this up quickly
[30:35] so it's amazing when you look at the
[30:37] family the human family of jesus we know
[30:40] from the bible that he has
[30:41] four brothers and i don't think the
[30:43] scripture ever gives us a number
[30:45] numerically of his sisters but we know
[30:46] he had a number of sisters and it's
[30:49] amazing
[30:50] how the history and you could read it in
[30:52] the bible
[30:53] tells us that his immediate family his m
[30:56] his mother even mary joseph not really
[30:59] sure some believe he was he passed away
[31:02] shortly after because he's not really
[31:04] mentioned and maybe he was just a quiet
[31:06] quiet person but he doesn't speak much
[31:09] the bible doesn't record much
[31:11] but we know it's incredible because
[31:13] his family
[31:15] doesn't really know what to make of him
[31:18] his immediate family now not his not his
[31:21] not his cut not even his cousins not the
[31:23] rest of of the village not the rest of
[31:25] uh of his of his country but his
[31:27] immediate family don't really know what
[31:30] to make of him in his ministry
[31:32] and it's incredible when you've been
[31:33] with someone for 30 years and then they
[31:35] start saying that they're the messiah
[31:40] it can cause trouble
[31:43] i'd imagine
[31:45] and and and it must have been you can
[31:47] just enter into the human side can you
[31:50] enter in this morning to the human side
[31:52] of this family and their struggle to go
[31:53] i don't know about this
[31:56] and in fact
[31:57] it's incredible the whole entire family
[32:01] at one point in the bible the whole
[32:03] entire family his immediate family
[32:06] thought he had gone crazy
[32:09] thought he'd gone mad and and and the
[32:11] bible actually records they think he's
[32:14] schizophrenic and it doesn't use that
[32:16] word but mary says that he's beside
[32:19] himself you ever realize when you say
[32:21] that man you're beside yourself you're
[32:22] calling someone schizophrenic
[32:25] you're beside yourself
[32:29] and so they they actually thought he was
[32:30] crazy that he had lost his mind and they
[32:33] didn't they they said he's we they think
[32:35] he's beside himself for like living two
[32:37] lives he's a carpenter who thinks he's
[32:40] god he's he's a man he's just a boy
[32:44] he's a man who was who thinks that he's
[32:47] messiah
[32:48] and any and he's he has a split mind in
[32:50] fact it says his family at one point as
[32:53] he's ministering to the multitudes the
[32:55] bible says his family his mother and
[32:58] father come to take him away and to take
[33:00] him home and lock him away
[33:03] you remember that story
[33:05] they come to take him to lock him away
[33:07] because they thought he was beside
[33:09] himself and when they got there there
[33:10] was multitudes of people and they
[33:13] couldn't even get to him to take jesus
[33:15] and so they send a message give this
[33:17] message to and jesus reads the message
[33:19] and you know what jesus says
[33:21] who is my mother
[33:22] says your mother and your father come to
[33:24] your mother and your brothers and your
[33:25] sisters come to take you and jesus says
[33:28] who is my mother
[33:31] who is my father who is my brother
[33:33] he that doeth the will of my father in
[33:35] heaven that is my mother that is my
[33:38] brother
[33:39] that is my sister
[33:44] i can't imagine just looking at this
[33:47] it had to have been painful or hurtful
[33:50] to marry
[33:52] because as you read through the gospels
[33:54] you see progressively after jesus enters
[33:56] his earthly ministry he he disassociates
[34:00] with mary
[34:02] and and almost not i don't want to use a
[34:04] strong word like disown
[34:07] but he disassoci he doesn't call her
[34:09] mother anymore
[34:11] but he calls her woman
[34:14] remember remember that he says woman
[34:16] what have i to do with thee
[34:18] so there's been a there's been a change
[34:20] there's been a uh something take place
[34:22] that there's been a shift
[34:24] and even at the wedding in canaan that's
[34:26] what he says to mary woman what have i
[34:29] to do with thee and it's not until the
[34:31] cross
[34:32] that the humanity because he was 100
[34:35] human right
[34:36] and he's 100 percent god brother branham
[34:38] said don't let nobody ever tell you he
[34:40] wasn't he was 100 man he was 100 god he
[34:43] was the god man
[34:46] and on the cross as he's dying he has
[34:48] compassion on mary's mother and he looks
[34:51] to john his closest disciple and he
[34:53] looks to mary and he says mary behold
[34:56] your son and he looks to john and says
[34:58] john behold your mother and so he puts
[35:01] mary in the care of john who he loved
[35:05] because he loved his mother
[35:08] i think this is just incredible to me
[35:10] when you look a little further than the
[35:12] doctrinal side of things and you look at
[35:13] the real life and that's what really
[35:16] james is about you still awake this
[35:17] morning
[35:19] you find mary at pentecost
[35:22] and then she's mentioned no more she
[35:23] spoke in tongues
[35:25] in the upper room she played her role
[35:27] she played an important vital role and
[35:30] as the bible says you'll be called
[35:31] blessed blessed uh by all generations
[35:34] we'll call you blessed
[35:36] and so it's incredible because even his
[35:39] brothers jesus's brothers
[35:42] tease him
[35:43] and you'll find that in the bible where
[35:45] they're teasing him oh it's the feast of
[35:48] uh of uh i forget which feast it was
[35:50] there but they they teased them and said
[35:52] go and go and make yourself known as
[35:54] messiah and these brothers are actually
[35:57] teasing jesus
[35:59] even after he begins his public
[36:00] ministries feast of tabernacles and they
[36:03] say go up and make yourself proclaim
[36:05] yourself as messiah because the jews
[36:07] knew that the messiah would be revealed
[36:08] at the feast of tabernacles and so but
[36:11] out of all of these brothers two of them
[36:14] two of those men who picked on him
[36:16] become writers
[36:18] of new testament
[36:20] books i believe i could be wrong but i
[36:22] believe jesus
[36:24] james the brother of jesus was who wrote
[36:26] the book of james that's debated and i
[36:27] don't really think it matters
[36:29] because what's important is that you
[36:31] understand that god was the author of
[36:33] all the books of this bible
[36:35] though he might have used men
[36:37] and it's incredible because jude and
[36:39] james and and it said
[36:42] it said that when jesus died on the
[36:44] cross
[36:45] his brother james was so deeply
[36:48] regretful
[36:50] for how he had treated
[36:52] his but how he treated the lord in his
[36:55] life that he said he'll never eat again
[36:57] and he and he said i'm going to begin to
[36:58] fast from the
