========================================
for [Music] for [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] God bless you this morning Saints good to be in the house of the Lord if we could all just stand to our feet really quick and just open up in a word of prayer Heavenly Father Lord we're grateful and thankful for another opportunity to come into your house this morning Father Lord we pray that you would just minister to us father we pray that you would feel welcome here in this service Lord Jesus Lord anoint the words father anoint the ears to hear father we just Lord give you glory honor and praise this morning Father invite you here Lord this morning for service Lord for worship father we're just here to hear from you Lord I ask all these things now in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen let's open up our Bibles and turn to uh the book Book of Luke this morning we're going to go to two two portions of scripture we have a little bit of a lengthy reading so I'm going to just try to be mindful here Luke chap 2 and verse 25 Luke 2 and 25 it says and behold there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon and the same man was just and devout waiting for the consolation of Israel and the Holy Ghost was upon him and it was revealed unto him by the holy ghost that he should not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ and he came by the spirit into the temple and when the parents brought in the Child Jesus to do for him after the custom of the law then took he him up in his arms and blessed God and said Lord now let us thou thy servant depart in peace according to Thy word for mine eyes have seen thy salvation which thou Hast prepared before the face of all thy people a light to the Gentiles in the glory of thy People Israel and Joseph and his mother marveled at those things which were spoken of him and Simeon blessed them and said unto Mary his mother behold this child is set for the fall and the rising again of many in Israel and for a sign which shall be spoken against yet a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also that the thoughts of many hearts shall be revealed amen God bless you as you take your seats this morning I'm just going to actually turn over in the book of Samuel as well and that one's a little bit lengthy so I thought we could just read that as we're SE seated here 1 Samuel the 1 chapter now there was a certain man of Ral zofim 1 Samuel 1 and verse one we're going to skip around here a little bit just for a context and there was a certain man of Ramo zopim of Mount Ephraim and the name was Elena the son of Jerome the son of eliu the son of toou the son of zeu an nephite and he had two wives the name of one was Hannah the name of the other was panah and panah had children but Hannah had no children and this man went up out of his City yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the Lord of hosts and Shiloh and the two sons of Eli Hoff and Phineas the priests of the Lord were there and when the time was that Eleni offered he gave to panah his wife and all her sons and her daughters portions but unto Hannah he gave unto a worthy portion for he loved Hannah but the Lord had shut up her womb if we skip down to verse 9 but Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh after they had drunk now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post in the temple of the Lord and she prayed in the bitterness of her soul and prayed unto the Lord and wept sore and she vowed a vow and said oh lord of hosts if thou wil indeed look on the Affliction of thine handmaid and remember me and not forget thine handmade a Manchild then I will give unto him the Lord all the days of the life and there will be no razor upon his head I want to take a title this morning the unselfish reaction we're going to look at these two characters this morning Hannah and Simeon we're going to refer back to Samuel in a few minutes but the man Simeon in the Bible the Bible the Bible said that the Holy Spirit was upon him and said to him Simeon you're not going to see death before you see the Christ and when it was revealed to him Simeon believed for it and one day when the Lord set events in order to bring his life uh bring his life to that promise Simeon was hungering and thirsting for that promise to come to pass you know he had maybe grown old in age holding on to that promise and you know the Bible says Matthew 56 if you're hungry for more of God the Bible says that those that are hungry and thirst for righteousness they shall be filled amen so one day the Holy Spirit came down and spoke to Simeon and he said you know Simeon now is the time for that promise to come to pass in your life you know I revealed this thing to you and now is the time for this thing to happen and you know Simeon found that little baby among among the crowds it wasn't the fanciest dressed one it wasn't the world the one the world may have thought of maybe not even the one that Simeon would have thought of but it was Jesus and Simeon comes to that juncture in his life and you just look at his reaction I may now depart in peace you know he didn't ask to to stick around and see how it would come to pass he he didn't need the Lord to do anything more than what the Lord had revealed to him would happen in his life and out of the thousands of the things in the Bible that said aren't documented John 21:25 even all the books could not contain the things that are documented God saw fit that this event be recorded in scripture he was pleased with simeon's reaction to what the Holy Spirit did in his life little old Simeon you know God chose to reveal this thing this thing to him and I'd like to just focus this morning on Simeon simeon's attitude for a moment you know brother Brena makes a great drama out of the scripture in a few sermons God keeps his word 1958 and the sermon Simeon 1954 I'm going to quote a few a few times from both of those you know and he said that God always has a Remnant who was waiting on his promises amen he always has a Remnant that is waiting on his promises we're that Remnant waiting on his promises amen we're a part of that here this morning and as he was feeding on the word that one day in the temple as a as a priest maybe would normally be just reading on the word maybe he was reading the scroll brother benam says of Isaiah 9 where it says unto us a child is born unto us is given and the government shall be upon his shoulders and his name shall be counselor and and Prince of Peace and and the Mighty God the Everlasting father and when the Bible says that the Holy Spirit revealed to him that he wouldn't see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ and this this Revelation was something that was completely settled in his heart it was something that would that was happened and when brother randam dramatizes this this event in the Bible he says you know maybe he went around and maybe he was they called him a Holy Roller you know maybe you know he he testified to this for a long time and they just said oh this old this old fogy this is you know what are you talking about Simeon but this was a revelation in his heart that God had told him this was going to happen and you know then the Lord came to him at this point it was time for this thing to be fulfilled and the Lord told him set down the scroll and follow me over this way just kind of dramatize here for a minute God leads by his spirit amen in in all cases God leads by his Spirit you know maybe he came around looking looking around the building and not sure exactly where he was going but just deep down something in his heart told him to keep going and look this is the day that I'm going to fulfill this scripture I'm going to fulfill this this this Revelation in your heart so just keep going it was settled you know and at that time in Israel's history the custom was that on the eighth day after the children were born that they would bring their male children down to the temple for purification and the cleansing of the mother for the circumcision of the baby boys so this particular day Simeon was being led of the Lord to go down to this place and he gets this you know he gets to this place and the Lord tells him you know this is this is that Prince of Peace that you were just reading about this is this you remember when I revealed this to you this is that this is him and his reaction was so humble and so so grateful so thankful you know the kind the focus this morning you know he probably took little baby Jesus and lifted him up you know with tears just running down his face falling from his beard and he said Lord let your servant now depart in peace according to your word for mine eyes have now seen your salvation you know I think many times the Lord sets up things stages in our lives he brings things together he hears our prayer and he cares about it amen he sets things in order and events in order to answer your prayer or to reveal something special to us and then when that light of Revelation does strike in your heart it's settled in there amen and he's always faithful but what is our reaction to do it back there in first Samuel Hannah actually she had no children she was Barren but something in her was so desperately longing to Bear children to have children to be a mother so she travailed it says the Bible says and brother randomp said her soul traveled she got in desperation she had a need amen many of us have gotten into those positions in our life right that we have a need and and we come in those desperations brother random says this in U desperation 1963 she got on her knees and she never noticed the Dignity of the temple she never noticed the dignified priest as he walked out she was in such distress till her tears were rolling down her cheeks cheeks and she was crying in desperation oh Lord God give me a son give me a son and notice I want you to just catch this here notice she wasn't selfish when God heard her and answered her prayer and gave her a son she gave him back to God and because that she was not willing to be selfish after God had answered her prayer pray her God gave her a prophet as a son oh that was an extra blessing he says and he's just full of them those extra little blessings he gives not only a son but a prophet and there had been no open Visions for many years in Israel so this was a great blessing and she wasn't selfish about it he answered her prayer and her reaction to God answering her prayer became this incredible testimony that we can read about you know she couldn't have kids and her prayer was to have kids and God granted her that request and she was so thankful and so grateful that she gave them back to God and she remembered the vow that she had committed to God even even if sometimes those vows that we do make to God in those things are hard you know if even if it meant giving her blessing back one night as I as I was just coming to this thought this thought had come to me and I was in prayer about a situation one of those things that you know you're earnestly in prayer about you know we all have those things maybe there just something in our heart that we're praying about the Lord would reveal to us the Lord would lead us and guide us on a certain situation and one night just after weeks of prayer the Lord had revealed some light on the situation aren't you glad for those things amen I'm so glad for that you know brother Benham says in the church age book the importance of Revelation by the spirit to a True Believer can never be overemphasized Revelation means more to you than perhaps you realize now I'm not talking about this book of Revelation you I'm talking about all Revelation it is tremendously important to the Church you know and the Lord has many ways of blessing his people you know he can bless through you know physical things you know material things I I understand that but the Lord has many other sources as well the Lord blesses through trials the Lord blesses through afflictions the Lord blesses through Ministry the Lord blesses with joy the Lord blesses the list can just go on and on and on but I think one of the most important things that He blesses us with is revelations in our life amen because Revelation tells tells you who you are amen the first church age brother bam says that's what the devil fights the hardest is to keep you from the revelation of who you are in him he says in this Revelation he tells us about what the end of the devil is he tells us how he was going and what he was going to deal with the devil and cast him into the Lake of Fire he reveals the end of the wicked one who would follow Satan and Satan hates that Jesus said about Satan he has no part in me and I have no part in him the devil would like to prove that different but he cannot so he does all that he can to destroy confidence in the word but when the church disbelieves Satan and believes the spirit's revelation of the word the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against her and that is the thing that the the devil tries to keep you from is to keep you of revelation of who you are in Jesus Christ amen and he knows that if the people can get in the church age book he knows that if the people can get the true revelation of the true church of what she is and what she stands for that she can do the Greater Works and that she can be an invincible Army amen if they get the true revelation of the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian church and by God's spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be powerless before her he will be definite he will definitely be thed today as when Christ wasto every effort to gain power over him in the desert yes Satan hates Revelation but we love it with true Revelation in our lives the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against it but we will prevail over them amen you know and he goes on to say in the church age book that the only the the only way to gain Revelation is through the Holy Ghost you know and he and he you know says it's nice to study scripture and that's a good thing you know we're supposed to study scripture we're supposed to study the Bible supposed to study the message but it's only the Holy Ghost can give you Revelation to show you what this is and what this is and put them together right and as Believers of God's word we know what the path is to take to get us to those points you know Faith cometh by hearing and hearing of the word of God right so the devil fights us harder than anything on that pathway hearing the word and finding the revelation of who you are in the word he just as simple as it is he just fights you from hearing about scripture he fights you from reading the word he fights you from listening to the message because he realizes that if enough light can shine on that seed in you then it can grow and as it begins to grow then all of those things will break away and you can become who you are Hannah's principle of of desperation speaks to how Believers should should should seek Revelation in their life she was desperate for it she laid it before God you know you don't care who makes fun of you you don't care how ridiculous you look Hannah looked probably really really ridiculous in that situation even the Bible says even the even the prophet Eli was like what what are you doing you know your lips are muttering are you are you in strong drink have you been have you been been drunk but she said no this is I'm in desperation for I have a need I want the Lord to speak to me that's how we should be with God in our lives with Revelation Lord I want you to speak to me I want you to I want you to reveal yourself to me I need more of you and you know when even how ridiculous you look in those situations God is always faithful to meet you there he's always faithful to reveal himself to you and but the devil always fights those simple things in your life he desperately tries to keep you from becoming sincere in your seeking brother rendom says this in the church age book he says is it is that simple there is nothing of such prevailing power as revelation of the word in verse three in a blessing a blessing is pronounced on those who give special attention to this book I think this refers to the Old Testament custom of the priest reading to the congregation in the morning you see many could not read so the priest had to read to them and and as long as it was the word the blessing was there it didn't matter if it was read or heard some sometimes he keeps you from being in church because it doesn't matter if you read it or hear it faith comes by hearing and he knows that if you just sit in church and you get under the anointing of the Holy Ghost that he knows he can bring you to where you are he knows that God can bring you there so he fights you he fights you so hard maybe to not get to church on time maybe to maybe to have mind battles when you're at church maybe to just keep you from where you need to be in church amen Revelation can come by sitting in church and you know just just to kind of give you a little insight here the Lord maybe lays it on a on a Brother's heart to go a certain direction by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost right you know there's a battle in the entire process just to give you just some steps here the Lord sees what you have need of so one day he sets it in motion for the pastor to have a burden to take a certain position to go this route in the scripture maybe the pastor has no idea why he's going that way right or maybe he sets it on you know one of these other brothers heart you know to minister a certain direction and you know the the devil fights it the whole way discouragement fights that preacher so hard you know maybe it's just me but you know I'll go through a hundred different scenarios in my head on on how this seems like a ridiculous thought or you know it's a weird angle or or or it doesn't make any sense or or you've already went that direction before and he and then he fights you he fights you as well maybe at Sunday morning he laid it on your heart to make it to Sunday school maybe he laid it on your heart to come to church you know but the devil has every H every demon in Hell fighting you to get there you know maybe the kids are extra fussy that morning and your car is making a funny noise or whatever the case is maybe it's maybe it's a mental battle right you're you're here you're in service but you're thinking about other things right you're discouraged you're depressed you're thinking about work you're stressed you're you're maybe you're not motivated to go all the while the Lord is fighting a battle in this Supernatural realm to get you in church because he knows that you've been praying about a certain thing so the Lord will just take that thing and he will bring you Revelation in that thing so the devil somehow he knows knows somehow the devil knows there's there's there's there's power in being in church so he just keeps you from there you know this is just all things that's going on in the spiritual realm you know and half the time we don't probably more than half the time we don't even realize that those things are going on but circumstances Prevail and the lord always will prevail amen you know you make it to church that day you know the the worship leader maybe sets it sets the right atmosphere get you out of the brain frog fog that you were living in then the word comes forth the and the thing that's been so heavy on your heart maybe something the pastor says just sheds enough light the right amount of light then it's unveiled to you that's what brother Benham says in the church age book that that that Revelation is it's an unveiling of something and it's settled in your heart you know that without a shadow of doubt that the Holy Ghost spoke to you Simeon knew without a shadow of doubt that the Holy Ghost spoke to him Peter may still have you know Pastor may still have had no idea why he added this in his sermon you know but thanks be to God the battle in that other dimension was one and and that Victory is already won because God has ordained even if you don't make it to church that day somehow some way he's going to shed light on that situation he's going to Prevail we do have to fight we do have to set things in order but God will prevail every time and it doesn't matter what the enemy says you know that you know that you know that the Holy Ghost revealed this thing to you that's what Revelation is you know that you know that you know it doesn't matter what anybody says now there's something seated in your heart that you have this thing here and nobody would ever be able to move that from you you know coming back to just earlier what I was talking about in my statement I had one of those times you know it wasn't specifically in a service but the Lord had revealed something to me and it had been a burden on my heart and it was lifted amen and that weight that I had been carrying I felt like Hannah there I was carrying this weight and and I had been carrying a need and the Lord had resolved it God does those things he does those things in your life and you know maybe sometimes the the whole world might not know about it because it's something between you and God and but the Lord resolves those things because he cares he cares about those things and he had resolved it and I had sat there and I was I was so disappointed in my reaction on the situation that he had done this thing for me and I read this this story here about Simeon and how the Lord had done something so miraculous in his life he had been able to see the Sal a of God and this baby and you know I maybe uttered three words in my heart thank you Lord for doing this how many times in our lives have we come to this place where the Lord has set these events in order and done all these miraculous things and and and fought so hard in the spiritual realm and then we say maybe three words thank you Lord how many times has that happened I felt so convicted in my heart I felt selfish you know and maybe those three words in my heart it may have seemed worse to say those three words than to say anything at all has anybody else ever been guilty of that amen you know and as Believers these types of situations actually happen frequently in our life and the devil fights us harder than anybody else because he knows that once we get the revelation we become an invincible Army my burden for this morning was was the attitude that they took when God did something in their lives Simeon patiently waited for the Holy Spirit to do this in his life and then when the promise was manifested his heart leaped for joy and his reaction became Lord I may now depart in peace he didn't try to take the promise further take to the next step and you know to see how the scripture was going to be fulfilled later down the road he wasn't selfish about just seeing Jesus as a baby he was overwhelmed with happiness and gratefulness that the Lord granted him the opportunity to see the salvation of the Lord Hannah's Prayer became and we didn't it was a lengthy reading so I skipped through it but in in in 1st Samuel the 2 chapter and Hannah prayed and said my heart rejoiceth in the Lord my horn is exalted in the Lord my mouth is enlarged over my enemies because I rejoice in thy salvation what a what a what is our reaction when the Lord does something in our lives no matter how great no matter how small you know we we classify things as humans you know this is great this is small God there there's no scale to God Amen like that he everything is big in his book amen what is your reaction to the Lord moving in in your life do we have a selfish attitude like that like I did do we have those kind of selfish things where you know the Lord did so many mighty things just to get you where you need to be and did we utter more than three words of thank you Lord we also can let ourselves get to a point where maybe you know we feel so revelated that the Lord is here to speak to you in those little simple small things what we might classify in our head as small things but it's God in Simplicity working amen he works in those things amen and we can find ourselves stumbling at the Simplicity of things because that's another way the devil fights Amen brother ROM says you know if Revelation is beyond you look up and see God for it that is the only way you are ever going to get it Church age book a revelation has to come from God it can never come by human natural endowment but by spiritual enduement you can even memorize the scripture and though that is wonderful that won't do it it has to be a revelation from God it says in the word that no man can say that Jesus is the Christ except by the Holy Ghost you have to receive the Holy Ghost and then and only then can the spirit give you the Revelation that Jesus is the Christ God the anointed one now you read that with a human mind and you say well many people say Jesus is the Christ but by saying that Jesus is the Christ meaning you believe it meaning that you act upon it meaning that the holy spirit sets it in order that you take every single word of the Bible many say that Jesus is the Christ but they'll come at that time and say and the Lord will say I never even knew you depart from me you workers of iniquity because you didn't know me by Revelation you sought me by a word but you never had the Revelation no man knows the things of God save the spirit of God and He To Whom the spirit of God reveals them brother renom says this church age book The first one I recommend highly you go read the first the chapter of the church age book it's important we need to call on God for Revelation more than anything else in the world we need to call on God for Revelation more than anything else in the world we have accepted the Bible we have accepted the great great truths of it but it is still not real to most people listen to the statement it is still not real to most people because the Revelation by the spirit is not there my goodness we ought to call for Revelation brother random says you can accept the Bible it says you can accept the great truths of it but it can still not be real to you because the revelation of the spirit isn't there you know and as you begin to pray for Revelation be specific with your requests ask big things James 4:2 says you have not because you ask not John 15 says to ask big things from God because Ephesians 3:20 says that he is able to do more exceedingly abundantly all that we can ask or think according to the power that works in us and he is willing to exceedingly abundantly take whatever request you have and move it to the next level I love Hannah prayed for a child God granted her that child she gave that child back to him and then because there's an extra blessing in in Remembering your promise to God she Grant he granted her more children he granted her that extra blessing having a prophet as a child and then he granted her more children he went exceedingly abundantly more than she even asked or thought he's willing to do that with your requests he was so pleased with her reaction to it and keeping her vow glory to God we have to be willing as Simeon was willing to be led by the spirit you know sometimes the leading of the spirit isn't cut and dry sometimes you question yourself the whole way amen that happens but you know that something is leading you that deep calling is leading you to something amen as long as you line it up with God's word and then you keep moving forward in it God will be faithful amen every time because he's faithful and he will speak amen and when he does speak let's give him a praise offering like Hannah did like Simeon did thanks be to God lord you moved in my life although many of the world thinks this is a small thing Lord I know you care about the small things I know you care about the little things in my life because you answered my prayer I didn't even verbally speak it the spirit made utterance and it groaned utterance and then you came down you revelated me Lord you gave me something that now can never be taken away I know you did that for me because I didn't even speak it the spirit uttered it then when we get to that situation how many times you know can we sacrifice something like Hannah did sometimes we we sacrifice things because we have a need from God you know we'll fast when we have a burden on our heart you know we'll give up something for a week so we can cleanse our minds from distractions or things but have you ever sacrificed something after the Lord has answered your prayer amen what about giving something up as a thanks offering to him thank you Lord for doing this in my life you know I'm just G to I'm maybe I'm just going to give something up just because I love you I'm just going to I'm just going to fast just because I I care about you just because you spoke to me and
