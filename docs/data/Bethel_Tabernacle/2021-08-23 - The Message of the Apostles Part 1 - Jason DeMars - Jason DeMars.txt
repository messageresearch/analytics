========================================

for everyone from my phone all right let's pray heavenly father we just come before you now lord and we're so thankful for your word i pray your light would shine in the darkness lord we're living in a uh exceptionally evil age lord and but i take great courage knowing that when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of god will raise a standard against it lord and we believe that your bride is being raised up so that the spirit of god could speak and and portray a standard through us lord help us to that end fill us with your spirit fill us with your wisdom fill us with your strength lord to stand in this evil day we ask in jesus name amen god bless you i'm going to start a topic called the message of the apostles this is part one and i'm going to read from second corinthians 5 17. therefore if any man be in christ he's a new creature or a new creation old things are passed away behold all things are become new amen you can be seated so i'm entitling this the message of the apostles because that's the authoritative message of the church that's what we're being called back to now i'm not gonna i'm i don't want to go into every single doctrine that's not what this is about in in in this topic more more looking at it like this there's a core reality that the apostles preached and through it salvation was made known and and just some things to establish the original message of the apost apostles that they delivered that's the pure gospel that is the gospel that we have to return return to in every age that's the call to the ages come back to the original faith the message of the apostles salvation is found in the message of the apostles and we understand through the age they slowly drifted away and then they slowly brought a restoration until god sent malachi 4 through brother branham's ministry to gather all of that restoration together and give us the full gospel before us so salvation is not in the interpretation of the church our church's interpretation another church's interpretation the pope's interpretation the archbishop of canterbury the president of the united pentecostal church international etc etc it's that's not the authoritative message that god was trying to get across we are supposed to preach what paul preached paul preached said if anyone preaches any other gospel than what i've already preached to you even myself or an angel that comes down from heaven let him and me be accursed you can't deviate from what the apostle paul originally preached and so that's what god will hold us accountable to that's what god has always held people accountable to now don't take that wrong in each age there's a message and there's a portion of the word allotted to each age that's to be restored and yet when god is looking down he's seeing this is my original message how faithful are you being to this original message which is contained in the scriptures the church cannot develop its own doctrine over over a period of time the church cannot take its response to false doctrine and develop another doctrine to fight against false doctrine this is the danger that's happened over the over over history the church cannot take its doctrine and say this is what we believe period and we don't need any correction and stay away from us if you have any other idea we can't we can't approach it in that manner we as believers today still have to be corrected back to the original faith you say but i have it it's in the message that's true god vindicated that message it's been delivered to us and yet none of us have received it perfectly otherwise the rapture would have taken place we'd all be we've all already been in the unity of the faith so the picture is not hey we've arrived the picture is that we need to constantly be living lives of correction and repentance in our understanding there's a there's there's this um doctrine that comes out of the reformation i'm not going to use the latin terminology but it's basically that it means that the church must always be reformed if we're in the process where we're just settling down and we're comfortable here and someone come and and a correction comes from the holy spirit we say we don't you know we've been in the message for 40 years don't you know we see everything perfectly and we're just right i don't need anything more the holy spirit says okay you stay there i'm gonna come move on with other people that want to move on that's critical for every one of us we must always be conforming ourselves to the word otherwise if we're not conforming ourselves to the word we're slowly conforming to the world there's the devil always has a process god always has a process it depends on who's we're listening to what we're feeding on and what our attitude towards what we're listening to is so there is a core reality of the gospel and you read the book of acts it's not difficult to discern what is being preached what is being proclaimed and the people hearing it and receiving it could then experience salvation in their own life that's what the gospel came to do it means good news good news because we need we needed salvation right so that's that's the foundation we actually need to be saved that means we're broken it means that there's impending doom that's coming our way basically right when you're when you're if you're everything's fine and everything's going to continue to be fine you don't need any salvation but when there's a condemnation that you're under that's there needs to be a salvation and that's why god had to come and make himself in the form of human flesh and shed his blood so that we could experience that salvation it's a it's an experience with god and and through history we see this mistake made one by the formal churches it's that we need we need our confession and we need obedience to these certain things that they believe are scriptural so they they say we need obedience to these specific scriptural orders and if we don't we can't experience the promised salvation then you have the other side of the the coin which is the pentecostal realm which is i have my own personal relationship with christ okay what does that mean apart from the word there needs to be a revelation and understanding of the word and there needs to be a walk of obedience to that word and you can't say i have a personal relationship i have a personal experience with god and then deviate from the word so on the one hand obedience to the word is required on the other hand if you don't have an experience with god all your outward obedience is meaningless and so there's there's this there's this balance that needs to be had but the gospel is to do what what is the gospel paul describes what the gospel is in first corinthians 15 he says it's the death burial resurrection and ascension of jesus christ i believe it in those facts of history fantastic they're facts of history i also believe alexander the great conquered many nations okay it's a fact of history that doesn't because i believe in alexander the great it doesn't do anything for me i believe in the fact that jesus died was buried raised raised from the dead is ascended at the right hand of god making intercession for us okay fantastic it's a good start but how does actually what that those historical facts those historical facts actually have to be applied to my life it's just because there is such a thing as salvation and i believe that it's a possibility doesn't mean i have experienced salvation in my life what did the gospel come to do ultimately what did it come to do it came to fix what adam and eve broke right so what what was broken fellowship with god and the image and likeness of god so christ came to restore fellowship and restore us to be the image and likeness of god that's what that's what the transforming power that comes the new creation in christ jesus that we become that's where it comes from is we're to be now expressing what man and woman were originally made to be which is a living expression of the invisible god and so this salvation that was basically you say this salvation was purchased by historical facts right it has to be then applied to our life how does that get applied to our life it's it's simple by the holy spirit and then over time we've got all these tremendous doctors how do we get the holy spirit well we have to be baptized sprinkled as an infant then we have to go through confirmation class and then we have to uh the list goes on and on we have to follow all the sacraments of the church we have to be in obedience and even then you don't really know if you're saved or not because then you have to go to the priest and make confession okay i'm a protestant you have to go up to the front of the church shake the preacher's hand make your confession get baptized write your name on the book go to new believer some churches they won't even let you get baptized until you go through a new believer's class for one year it's the same thing as a catechism class it's no different there was a there was a group that we were formerly working with in the middle east called themselves message believers and they said we don't want to baptize anyone until they've been through a new believer's class for one year said all right you can go ahead and have your catechism classes but we're going to follow the scriptures as many as believed were baptized so all of these things add to add to add to add to it's good to be taught it's good to be it's good to grow in your faith you have to you must if you have true faith you will grow in your faith but the reality is all of those things are replacing one thing and that's an experience by the holy ghost that changes this life that applies the death burial resurrection and ascension of jesus christ to us otherwise all you're believing is in vain we you have to apply brother branham talks about that in the token message you have to apply the token the life is in the blood right the life is in the blood they had to put that expression of life the blood on the doorposts in other words it had to be if it just stayed in the bucket it's a fact there's a historical fact that a blam was slain but god said apply it it has to be applied so then it's applied the death angel can pass by so for us it's not enough to just confess that you believe the message brother branham says that means you can read you must apply the token which is a personal experience say how do i know if i have it if you have it it produces the same life that jesus had it's so simple these things are just the core reality of the gospel and yet the church and sometimes the message leaves it all behind where we are so revelated that we miss the simplicity of our need you have to have the holy ghost for the blood to be applied listen closely for the blood to be applied you have to do what have the token what's the token the holy ghost so how are you going to get the application of the blood of jesus without the baptism of the holy ghost you're not it's not going to happen so do we need it this has been spoken about before but the we need the word in its fullness preached in our age to receive the holy ghost a false word is not going to produce holy ghost lives in the people that are listening amen it's not going to do it it's going to produce a false word produces a false life in luther's age they had a part of the word in wesley's age they had a part of the word we don't have an excuse now we have the full word vindicated right in front of us we can't say i'm just look at all those people out there in the world i'm better than they are therefore i have all i i have need of that's not how it works the spirit of truth guides you into all truth not a part of the truth not a little bit of the truth the holy spirit teaches us corrects us and conforms us to the word so jesus is that savior that healer he's the one that changes and transforms every heart that's what the holy spirit has come to do is your heart been changed do you have a desire to walk in obedience to the full word of god then the token's been applied it's not it's not a complicated thing you say i fall short in a lot of ways me too me too but i'm a work in progress i the spirit of god is working inside of me again a person be full of facts about the message that is not the same thing as having the token applied full of facts about this is the seven thunders this is godhead doctrine but what about your life that's what christ came to do not to give us knowledge he came to redeem us so that the lives that we have are expressing what what he made us to be in in the beginning in his image and his likeness to be the visible expression of the invisible spirit so we're walking you and i are walking around in life people are seeing god that's what we were made created in the beginning to be jesus died on the cross so that we would have that what do we have the message today what is the restoration of the message today so that we would be him manifested why were we restored to the full why did we even have to be restored to the full word couldn't we just have the blood of christ and have a part of the word there'd be no rapture that's for sure there needs to be a full word restored are you gonna are we gonna be a bride without spot or wrinkle with just one part of the word maybe we have seven sacraments and we believe in all kind of nonsense but hey we believe in jesus that's enough i got a relationship with jesus that's that that's doesn't mean anything that has no meaning without the life of jesus being inside of you judas had a relationship with jesus too it didn't mean he experienced salvation right caiaphas had a relationship with jesus too oh but i'm not talking about that okay what are you talking about then our jesus in you produces a life of what surrender to the word jesus said if you love me you'll do whatever you want to do and you'll disregard anything everything half of what i say that's what the denomination tells us that's what the system tells us we don't need the full word we're comfortable with where we're at the bride is not comfortable with where she's at until she's in full surrender to jesus christ if you love me keep my commandments and he says where i am there will my servant be also it doesn't say wherever my servant is that's where i am who's the one that's leading you or him my goodness i'm so far off my topic matthew 16 16-18 peter had a supernatural revelation simon peter replied you're the christ the son of the living god and jesus answered him blessed are you simon barjona for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my father who is in heaven and i tell you you are peter and on this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it that's the revelation of who he is peter is not that rock peter means little stone jesus is not directly the rock rather it's the revelation of who jesus christ is that is the foundation that the church is built upon it's the foundation right it's not the continuation it's just the foundation this is where we start who is jesus who is jesus is jesus the one that's proclaimed on the denominational church oh yeah that's jesus it is jesus is who he says he is jesus is where he manifests himself so when jesus wants to be known he makes himself known we don't get to stand up and say hey this is what we this is what this is what jesus is that's theology jesus declare he's first he's declared himself in the word and then he's promised certain things in the word to be manifested in certain ages then who is jesus the mighty angel that came down with an open book to restore us back to the original faith jesus is not some historical figure that died 2000 years ago that people want to model their lives over because he was such a good man that's not who jesus is that's who he was but who is he it's who he declares himself to be who you know when moses was called of god he said who should i say sent him he didn't he didn't say well you know historical god he made reference to a historical god the god of abraham god of isaac the god of jacob but when he said who will i say sent him he didn't say tell him the god of jacob sent you he said i am that i am tell them i am sent you the god who declares himself that's another way you could translate i am that i am is i become what i become in other words i manifest myself in front of you that's who who is this the one that's been manifested that's the importance of this message let's not get away from that what is it what is this all about we have a relationship with jesus what jesus there's another jesus which is not jesus who is jesus he's the one who manifests himself he's the i am not the i was not the i will be the one who's declared himself in this day through a prophet this is who jesus is the whole world is grasping after something else something different another idea another theology a new book that some superstar quote unquote christian theologian puts out no no he is the word and he declares himself the same yesterday today and forever he did that through the prophet so that we would understand what is he doing in this hour he is perfecting a bride jesus is not calling in denominations you see denominations they have meetings they have things happen people are coming to the altar they're not experiencing jesus say who are you who do you think you are up there telling us who jesus is and who jesus isn't the prophet taught us the truth has nothing to do with my idea we just need to get rid of this false concept that there's a thousand jesuses and whichever way i live it's fine just as long as i stamp the name of jesus on top of it that's not right it's not scriptural jesus produces a life that's in conformity to the word not in conformity to our thoughts not in conformity to the world to the word that's the jesus that we worship that we're serving people say well that's not my jesus okay you have your own jesus you make up your own jesus but it's an idol jesus has been manifested today we don't get to make up what we like we don't get to make up the doctrines we don't get to say oh we like this one and like that one and this one's okay and that one's okay go ahead go ahead you're doing exactly what they did when the white horse rider was writing don't listen to the voice of the white horse rider there's a word that's been vindicated and manifested we have to take it back to the bible we have to use spiritual discernment to understand what's thus saith the lord but when brother brandon preaches something for 20 years it's not our job to redefine it to change it to say oh that's wrong no god vindicated that word and he expects disa he says i want you to obey that word when the prophet deuteronomy 18 when a prophet comes preaches that preaches his brings his message he says those who don't listen i will require it of them in other words they're going to answer to god at the day of judgment for turning down and rejecting the manifested word amen let's let's stand and pray heavenly father i thank you so much for your word lord help us to not conform you to our thinking lord but to be conformed to what's been proven and vindicated help us lord forgive us our sins forgive us our unbelief lord cleanse our hearts father correct us and help us lord to walk more lord in that image and likeness which he created us to be we ask your blessing upon the worship upon the preaching of the word may your name be lifted up and glorified we ask these things in the name of our lord jesus christ amen god bless you [Music] you
