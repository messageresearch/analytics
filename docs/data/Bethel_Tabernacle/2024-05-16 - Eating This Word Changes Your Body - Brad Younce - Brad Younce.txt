scripture there and then we'll go over to Exodus glad to say to have my my mom dad and couple my sisters and half their children here tonight they wanted to come here brother Jason but but Jason says you have to stay till Sunday amen Jeremiah 15:16 thy words were found and I did eat them and Thy Word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of my heart for I am called by thy name oh Lord God of hosts now over in Exodus chap 12 you all should have this scripture by memory by now we've heard a few times the last few weeks Exodus 12: verse five your lamb shall be without blemish a male of the first year you shall take it from the sheep or from the goats and ye shall keep it until the 14th day of the same month and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening and they shall take of the blood and strike it on two side post and on the upper doors of the houses wherein they shall eat it may God add a blessing to the reion have your seats for a title this evening I want to speak on eating this word changes your body this scripture we was reading right here is the first communion because brother R said in communion communion was held first way down in Egypt the first of the communion which was the Passover Lamb that was slain which was a type of Christ and when they come out there wasn't a feeble one among them and there even their clothes was not even threadbear for 40 years God had kept them and in taking of the communion was a difference between life and death and those who were on the inside under the shed blood took the communion and no one could take the communion outside being under the shed blood the blood of the Lamb was shed first then was put on the lentil and on the doorpost and on the doorpost and the lamb was roasted and was eaten with bitter herbs and they GED themselves after the blood was shed they had passed pass under the shed blood they were girded and ready for the March they must come under the blood first and be cleansed from all sin which is unbelief and then be shod with the preparation of the Gospel having on the whole armor of God ready for the summons at any time and it was a sign that the death angel could not go beneath the blood the death angel had to rise and go over the blood and there is where the PO got the inspiration when I see the blood I'll pass over you eating changing your body you know we're living in an age where all people talks about you'll go on social media wherever you meet people on the street what kind of DT you want this week people are working out they're in these gyms and they've got diets for everything they got diets to lose weight D to gain weight diets to get stronger DTS for your cholesterol all kinds of diets people are serious about these things they're strict on these diet they'll cut out things in their life they'll cut out ice cream and sweets and carbs and they'll cut out all these things in their diet because they're serious but tonight we need to be serious that we cut things out of our diet we cut out what music we listening to the things we watch the way we look like the world the way we act we cutting out our on our diets there's things we need to cut out don't be quiet amen helps us you say hey man we'll get done quicker know last year I went on a last year I gained about 25 pounds or something like that eating McDonald's every day eating changes your body so back in January I cut out the the the lunches lost 25 PBS and it changed the way I look to change the way I feel even my clothes are looser I told my wife I said I'm going to have to start eating again cuz I can't afford new clothes but the way I eat changed my look you got it we're on a spiritual night we want to eat our body to a change I tell you what if we spent so much time on the word of God as we did on our diets what kind of people would we be amen hallelujah on you still love me right all right you know we've heard brother Jason been preaching brother Matt's mentioned it last time he was up here that the most important thing here are young people is getting the Holy Ghost amen we said it you've heard it I just said it again the most important thing you're receiving the Holy Ghost it is vital after you receive the Holy Ghost it is vital to be feeding on this word by your diet you're known what you feed on is who you are if you you feed on the world then what do you become the world but if you feed on God what do you become you become little Gods you know the children of Israel had G down in Egypt we all we all know the story we ain't got time to go into that how they come down and sojourned for 400 years and Moses came down on the scene to to draw them out Moses went in the wilderness for 40 years come back and started doing all these plagues upon Egypt God say I'm going to have my glory on on Pharaoh so he had all these plagues and the last one was going to be death so we'll skip a little bit you like that you know the story of all this stuff we're not we ain't got time to go into it but in Exodus 12:1 the Lord spake unto Moses I want you GA the people and I want you tell the people this in the land of East saying this month shall be unto you the beginning of months it shall be the first month of the year to you you know which is about the middle of March and April is our is in our in our calendar before it was in the middle of September and October being their first month he said I want the middle of March to be the start of the new year that's the month of the crucifixion of Jesus and the resurrection so he says speak ye into the congregation of Israel saying in the 10th day of the month they shall take to them every man a lamb according to the house of the fathers a lamb for a house it was one lamb for a house he didn't say go out there and get you two Lambs or three Lambs he says get you one lamb the father was to bring the lamb into their house it was to become part of the family so that when it was time for a sacrifice it would be a greater sacrifice for them to sacrifice a part of the family they brought that lamb in no doubt the kids named him whatever you would name a lamb this little lamb had a name it become part of the family and by the time was sacrificed on the 14th day it was cherished and then it was mourned God wanted the sacrifice of something precious that's the what Jesus was Jesus was part of the family the father had set him aside for service Jesus entered Jerusalem four days before he was to be crucified to be set aside for the service Exodus 12:4 and if the household would be too little for the lamb let him and his neighbor next unto his house take it according to the number of souls every man according into his eating shall make your count for the lamb the law required that at least 10 people for each Pascal lamb but I thank God that this the lamb Jesus was enough for everybody your lamb should be without blemish a male of the first year you shall take it from the sheep or from the goats we had to have a lamb for this day we had to have a lamb without blemish we had a lamb that was virgin born God's was God's greatest gift to this earth that land slain back in in Exodus at one year old was in the prime of his life when Jesus was slain he was in the prime of his life look at the parallel the 14th day of the same month and the whole assembly of congregation shall kill it in the evening this slain lamb of Exodus 12 represents the slain lamb at Calvary so on the 14th day of the month Jesus was brought before pilate's Hall this lamb was slain about the same time that Jesus died in the afternoon around 3:00 they were slain on the same day they took Jesus into into Pilot's Hall and smoted him and beat him with whips and chunks of Flesh come off his body he stood there a perfect sacrifice but not a word was said not a word did he utter I could I could see him sit there and take those beatings and he had that far away look in his eyes if they could ask him what are you looking at Jesus why ain't you saying a word and why he was taking those beatings he was looking ahead in time and he was seeing bethl Tabernacle he says I'm taking all of this for you the slain lamb for you we heard you know we heard that saying you know when Jesus took that last breath and cried it is finished the saying Heaven is just a breath away this is when that saying came to pass Jesus took that last breath and when he died Heaven become just a breath away cuz once before we could get to him there was no bridge but when he died there was a bridge that we could access heaven heaven is on only a breath away he represented the lamb that was slain in a garden for Adam and Eve it's getting hot up here when she fell to the lies the devil if we believe a lie of the devil death sets in on us that's what happened to to Adam and Eve when they believe the lie of the devil death set in on them Exodus 12:7 they shall take the blood and strike it on two side posts and on the upper doorpost of the houses wherein they shall eat they were to strike that door they got this hup they dipped it in the blood and went over and painted the door I don't know how much they put on it but it was it better have been enough I can see that that boy the oldest son father are you sure the blood's there and the father would come around and look up there says yeah it's right there do you think it's enough it's enough son just one drop of Jesus Christ will take away the sin of the world but they couldn't eat that lamb until they applied the blood to the doorpost first even if they did roast a lamb they could have went in our house and cooked it roast it like Moses said but if they didn't put the blood on the door that Death Angel could still walk right in fathers that's why we need to do to our homes we need to put the blood over our doorpost and say devil you're not welcome here if you got a Lost Child a lost loved one a husband or a wife or a family member just apply the blood over their door the devil's not allowed in there apply the token we can eat this word and gain a head knowledge but if we don't apply the blood to our lives and get Washed by the blood we will perish like the rest of the world we can't truly eat this word until you've received the Holy Ghost you know eat you get the Holy Ghost you're eating this word it's like going into an exclusive restaurant you know what exclusive restaurant is it's real expensive I can't afford to go into one we went into one a couple years ago saved a lot of money just to go eat one best steak I ever eaten but exclusive restaurant it means it's only for a certain class of people only for a certain class of people are y'all awake okay it only serves those who are qualified to eat it so if you got the money you can eat this restaurant it's all included those that can afford it this is for the high class people it's for a certain type of I'm saying again it's a serpent type of people it's like those that's predestinated before the foundation of the world those who called for this thing you're a certain class of people you're ordained you allowed to eat of this but I say if you don't like what's being served tonight you shouldn't have came to the restaurant you should have went to the BST I me McDonald's you know how you are you go to a restaurant and you cut into your steak I don't like this it don't taste good hey waiter get me another steak an exclusive restaurant this is on the menu this is what you're eating if you don't like it this is it you'll see where I'm going in a you can't go to this restaurant and say Hey you know I changed my mind I want a piece of chicken you go back there and you say hey waiter come here brother Luther go tell that preacher I don't like what he's preaching Luther he'll just say that's what's on the menu that's what the chef is cooking it doesn't matter what rest you go into it's all about the chef what's the chef got cooking tonight what's the chef special you know you go in you'll see these signs today special what's the chef got cooking up for us tonight the waiter is not the chef the waiter just comes in takes you to your seat he says you're going to like what's being prepared tonight you won't see the chef but he has all these little Cooks around around him doing what the chef said the chef's made the recipe the chef's done he done fixed it he knows what it's supposed to taste like and he'll go by and say no you need to add a little bit more this ingredient you didn't put enough ingredient I told you to then he'll come back and say oh that's good we can serve it God is a great chef so when when these brothers are around here studying preparing a meal God will come down and under inspiration say no put that quote with that scripture put that scripture with that quote you might make a note of this right here the cooks are the preachers we're served this ain't going like I thought it was I was having a good time yesterday morning doing this he says I want you to add this qu of this scripture I want you to do this when it looks over he says it's good it's time for the meal and then the song leader comes out he says let's all stand let's see only believe it's time to eat and you put on your spiritual Bib and you got your fork and your knife and you start cutting on what the preacher's saying woo this is good stuff right here I was talking about that restaurant me and her went to that was the best steak I've ever eaten ever it was so good I didn't eat steak sauce you know you be in the restaurants you get a steak you're like A1 this restaurant you didn't have to these kind of restaurants is an insult to the chef if you ask for a one sauce they feel like their steak's good enough you don't need to add nothing to it that's what our Chef is tonight he thinks this is good enough you don't need to add nothing to it we don't need a flavor it up we just said what the prophet said this is fine dining at its best but remember this meal is only for a certain class of people an elect lady but you can't eat this meal until you've paid for it Hallelujah go back to your little story here as that son going around say is there enough blood father he keeps going by make sure they're it didn't rain and wash it off there's nothing going to wash this blood off son the blood is stained Hallelujah the blood is stained the blood is stained to our hearts the life of Jesus if you have it it's engraved in your heart you ain't going to get rid of it you say I can't can you lose the Holy Ghost once you get it no if you truly get it you can't lose it he said yes that son son that blood is still there come here take another look don't worry devil can't cross the bloodline don't worry son the devil ain't going to cross that blood and he can't you worry about your soul if it's covered by the blood the literal life of Jesus Christ nothing to worry about that devil can't even cross over but you can't even start eating this lamb this word until the blood has been applied to our doorpost the SE and been set on fire the Holy Ghost then we can start eating our lamb the word not until we have the fire of God down in our soul can we start feeding on the body word of the son of man just like Israel eating their lamb it was given them strength they need to change their body cuz remember there was not a feeble one among them there was definitely old people there was definitely people that walks around like I do there was not a feeble one among them why it is in what they were eating we are eating our way to a body change we're getting ready for travel so just eat more lamb Hallelujah feed on the word he says they shall eat the Flesh in that night roast it with fire unleavened bread with bitter herbs they shall eat it eat not of it raw nor Soden at all with water but roast with fire his head with the legs with the pertinence thereof you're to eat every bit of this lamb they were eat the intestines they were to eat everything that was on this lamb they didn't say I don't like them intestines I I'm not eating it they didn't have a choice just like us when we hear the word of God oo I don't like that but you got to eat it whether you like it or not because he says you got to eat the entire word the entire word eat the whole lamb and ye shall L let nothing of it remain until the morning and that which remaineth of it until morning you shall burn it with fire R says when you eat it don't eat it raw or Soden but you must eat it well cooked he says I like that people try to eat the word of God and they take it like it was raw and chew on it and spit on it and everything else say oh I just can't take it I can't stand it it isn't cook done enough he says cook it with fire and that fire represents the Holy Ghost you get God in your heart first it'll cook it for you that's right cook it out done season and then it tastes good you are what you eat if all you eat is vegetables you're a vegetarian I like this one if all you eat is meat it ain't a word but you're a mearian you are what you eat if you are the if you eat this word you become God we're not feasting on the Corporal body of Jesus you're not up here feasting on no body of a man but we're feasting we're not cannibals but we're feasting on the body word of the son of man cuz Jesus says in John chap 6 verse this is important John 6:47 says verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me hath everlasting life amen I am the bread of life your fathers did eat the the man in the wilderness but are dead this is the bread which cometh down from heaven that a man may eat thereof and not die I am the living bread which come down from heaven If any man eat of this bread he shall live forever this ain't Sarah Lee this ain't Ezekiel this is Christ and the bread that I will give them is my flesh which I will give for the life of the world the Jews therefore strove among themselves saying how how can this man give us flesh to eat and then Jesus said to them said verily verily I say unto you except ye eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you amen whosoever eateth My Flesh and drinketh my blood haveth eternal life there's the key if you don't eat it you ain't got eternal life it's just a simple as that but whosoever eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life and I will raise him up in the last days for my flesh is meat in my flesh is meat indeed and my blood is drink indeed so he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and I in him Hallelujah as a father has sent me I live in a father so he that eateth me even he shall live by me this is that bread which came down from heaven your followers eat they are dead B said except ye he backs this up he says except you eat the Flesh of the son of man what do you think of a doctor would have thought if he had been sitting in there what do you think of a man would just come and thinking you have to eat my flesh and drink my blood they say this man is nothing but a vampire he's not a minister stay away from that man he's crazy stay away from him but it was the truth it was the truth except you eat it you'll perish you'll all die if you don't eat it he said the bread and wine is only a symbol don't let that natural thing get you down you got to eat Christ which is the word that you live by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God from The Book of Genesis to the Book of Revelation every word the son of man is Christ first is false anointed ones or this is the anointed ones of the end time the son of man is Christ he is the one that you're feeding on you're not feeding on no man his words will fail but you're feeding on the unfailing body word these says in Exodus 12 again and thus shall ye eat with your loins girded your shoes on your feet your staff in your hand and you shall eat it in haste right you ain't got time to put your little bib on and eat slow I've worked at the hospital some of you people works in the hospitals you know how it is they say you get 30 minutes for lunch but a lot of times you don't and so you all you do you're done and I still eat that way 14 years of training I still eat fast eat it in haste your staff in your hand you got to be ready you got to have your shoes on your feet you got to have your spear up you got to have your shield on ready to go because at any minute the death angel is going to pass over any minute the Rapture is going to take place any minute you got to be ready to go so what I would do if I was you I'd start eating this stuff in haste get every word of it you can because the more you eat it changes your body where before you're old all of a sudden you're a young man again a young woman because of what you eating it's the same today as it was in Egypt when they ate the lamb they were dressed to leave and that's the bride we're making ourselves ready we're putting on our helmet we're ready to go you're eating this words you can watch your body change before your very eyes you get up in the morning look in the mirror and where you didn't have any hair stuff starts growing you're watching yourself change before your very eyes your feet Shaw with the preparation of gospel peace above all take the shield of Faith wherewith you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take th helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God says when you see the church going in this great exus it's the pillar of fire leading before us standing and Performing Miracles and signs he is here tonight in all his redeeming power he is here to make whole every sinner to take back every backslider he is here to heal every sick person every sick person he is the Full Gospel and we preach the Full Gospel eat the whole lamb roasted with the Holy Ghost and know that it's good eating for the Holy Spirit has divined us that it is real good taste and see the Lord is good it tastes like honey on the Rock our he says our lord Jesus here in his love and Power in his great Redemptive blessings and he stands between the church and sin tonight and he stands between you and judgment bleeding and praying wow But first you got to apply the blood you got to get Sanctified you got to clean out your house you got to get rid of the sin the leaven bread get it out of your house get your shoes on get dressed for the journey start eating this word when Israel ate that lamb not one feeble person was among them say these Jews they come up each year and there was a fountain inside the church and they taken the bread and the bitter herbs than the lamb and they drank it from this fountain in the church and they rejoiced together because that God had showed them favor amen so this being the time the Passover Not only was it the Passover it was a special one there was something there's sometimes that we go to church and we all love to we all love to but there's something times that something special happens you know what I'm talking about there just some service that something special just happens and this was one of those times the air was charged with expectancy Moses had gave him the word Moses told him you apply the token then when you get the Holy Ghost you start eating and feeding on this lamb they're expecting something because he says a death angel is going to pass pass over and that Pharaoh is going to say get out they were expecting something are you is there expectancy in the air this evening are we expecting something to happen right if you're looking for it he'll come to you we're expecting the exit once again so you got to eat this word not just part of it when you eat this word it don't matter if your favorite football team loses what a lot of amens on that one it don't matter the petty little things don't matter oh she bought a dress just like me I got to take it back things don't matter Israel was commanded to take a lamb and kill it and put the blood over the door and every family go in and eat that lamb Fellowship around the roasted lamb that's what we're doing this evening we're having Fellowship around the roasted lamb eat the body of the Dead sacrifice that died in their stead God says when I see the blood I'll pass over you the death angel could not touch the him because the blood of the Lamb was over the door and they were in in there having communion fellowshiping around the lamb Hallelujah that's the way it is in our heart when we apply the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ he takes away all our sins and then we can have fellowship and eatting the word of God around the table of God fellowshipping upon Godly things in the Physical Realm that if you're just eat a little bit that's all you can eat you know some people going to eat just a little bit cuz stomach stomach's so small but if you want to get a bigger stomach start eating more if you got a spiritual small stomach tonight go ahead and start eating you'll find that belly start getting big and you just keep eating more and more until your stomach swells larger and larger and he says I'm telling you what the church needs today I got this in big bold letters so I won't miss it what the church needs today is a good oldfashioned spiritual gastronomic Jubilee it's exactly what we need is to eat on the word of God until we just crowd out the world crowd out everything and stick the word of God in there and live by it what you eat today won't help you tomorrow so the hamburger you ate this afternoon you will probably have to go home after church and have another one oh that's what we had tomorrow morning you'll have to get up and make you some eggs and bacon to go through the day so what today it ain't going to help tomorrow you need food every day that's way it is with this what we're eating today we're going to need something else tomorrow something else Friday something else on Saturday we need to keep eating you just can't eat one time and say well I'm good for the week well I went to church on Sunday I think I I can make it till next Sunday I don't need to go Wednesday that was free the Holy Spirit feeds on the word that's what Jesus says man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God that's what the matter one of these things today that makes the church in his anemic condition is because it doesn't take time to feed on the word the church is hungry he said if I was a doctor a great big Stout looking man come in here said sir I'm sick well what are your sin symptoms I'm so weak I can't hardly pick my hands up that's the way sometimes we come to church we'll come to church we're so weak because we haven't had time to read and pray and eat the word like we want to and our hands are just so weak we can't get them the preacher says come on lift your hands up let's worship God and yours this is all you got we're so weak we can't go no further I'm so weak I can't hardly pick up my hands I'll would say what are the few physical conditions I would say well sir have you been eating regular on oh I had a half a cracker day before yesterday well he said you're just hungry you need strength you need to eat amen I'm just going to tell you what you need to do right now if you feel weak spiritually all you need to do is eat that's what the matter with the church just read a scripture one little verse on Sunday morning and we ought to have our head in the word every minute we have to spare God help us God I say God help us every minute that we have to spare wonder how many likes I had on that picture I posted 35 I've got 750 people following me I bet you open up that bible app over there in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwell among us hallelujah we ought to have our head in his word every minute we have to spare take a lot of times and lay something else's side and read that word he says again man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God but our Delight should be in the Lord to meditate on God's word day and night as it says in Psalms 1 but we can't keep the victory because of what we're feeding on if we feed on the word and the things of the world will never be Victorious and you wonder why you can't overcome things in your life is because you're feeding on the wrong thing truth PL truth we just go from service to service barely Mak it it in fall through the door okay preacher what do you got for me tonight we're so weak we need to eat it not quit feeding on it is carnal stuff but we need to feed on the lamb that is provided for us it's been provided this food's been provided for you sometimes we don't even go to church some say I don't need church I don't like being around peopleo I know a few people like that I know few people few P got delivered I don't like being around people I don't like fellowshipping with others says contending for the faith to you oh men or women when you separate yourselves from Believers people says I can stay at home and be just as good as a Christian as I can at church you can't right the Bible says not to forsake to assemble yourselves together and that much more as that day approaches if you're a Christian you long to go where other Christians are and the fellowship with other Christians I was glad when they said let's go to the house of the Lord it don't matter who's preaching oh no Brad Ys again we need one another more than we ever did we ever did each other before is now when you get yourself singled out from the rest of them and make yourself just a little different you don't want to associate with them because they believe this and don't want to associate with that but you're getting on Dangerous Ground right then keeping away from the church he talking about that might be somebody you disagree with but you're keeping yourself from church you're on dangerous ground keeping away from church find the one of your choice remain there and be a Christian brother to all of them that's the way to be a real Christian then we got the fellowship and protection and people that love you and pray for you this one little lineing thirsting for life the holy spirit in you it'll feed on the word amen so you need to eat this word it has its benefits when you eat this word you get salvation you get spiritual food you get growth you get wisdom you get cleansing you get guidance you get comfort you get joy you get blessings how do I get these benefits you hear the word read the word study the word memorize the word meditate on the word the only way to leave in this Exodus now the Rapture is to eat this word eat the lamb we are eating ourselves to a body change I can see them in that room eating the lamb old grandpa sitting over there has a Canan barely can walk give me a buy of that lamb son son picks one off the shelf here you go the deity of Jesus Christ W that's pretty good give me another one faith is the substance of things hoped for what else you got the future home of the Heavenly bridegroom the spoken word is the Original Seed the token the Rapture the more he ate of this word the stronger he become or he found himself when he started like this that when he started eating he was able to drop the cane and walk out where is that devil where's that death angel I ain't afraid of him he ain't coming in my house sometimes we have the blood appli to our doors but we're not eating and we're scared of the devil you ain't got enough strength to fight the devil so the more you eat the stronger you get you can you remember the story brother BR to it about the little the the man had a dream that there's a devil in front of him every time the devil say boo the man will get the man will get the devil get bigger you know the story The Devil go boo and every time he did the man got smaller and the devil got big until he thought it was disappearing and he looked over there and he seen the word and he walked up to the devil he didn't he had the strength he looked up to the devil and says boo and when he did the devil got smaller and he got bigger he started feeling himself getting stronger he says boo devil and the more he did it the weak the smaller the devil got till he finally disappeared that's what we want to do the devil this evening we want to become so strong on the word of God that we say boo devil and he's gone amen hallelujah I'm about finish don't get nervous so we're eating our way to a body change it's like a caterpillar when a caterpillar is born they are born for one purpose and that's to become a butterfly when we are born into this world we are born for one purpose and that purpose has become the Bride of Jesus Christ when a caterpillar is born they have one job and that is to eat and have you seen a caterpillar I remember being a kid and we had these little things in school little project we put a caterpillar in there and start feeding and all that thing does with eat every time you look at it they just chomping away I don't see nobody chomping tonight Are You full they have to eat the right kind of diet they can't just eat anything huh that sounds familiar we can't just eat anything the Baptist doctor ain't going to get us out of here they have to eat the right kind of diet there is a certain thing we must eat we can't Feast on the things of the world expect our bodies to change for flight our bodies that we live in isn't up to the task that's like the caterpillar there's no way he's going to be able to fly with all these little legs can't fly with legs he's Earthbound but what he has to do he has to keep eating our bodies this body we live in can't live up to the task we can't produce the change that we need but there's got to be a change from the inside out as a caterpillar is eating to bring forth what's inside of him that's what we're doing we're keep eating to bring forth what's inside of us turning us inside out it's not just our inside is our outside it's our inside is our inside inside is our outside it's our entire being a caterpillar once that is completed they'll Break Forth from that body you see them getting a c cocoon they'll wrap theirselves up they'll stay there for a while they've eating ourselves into something all of a sudden I se this what they needed to fly was in them when they were a caterpillar those wings they needed was in them when they were a caterpillar all of a sudden you'll see that thing start bursting you'll see them start spreading out they start flapping their Wings they'll pop their head out that little hole there and they're looking out say I got to bust out of this thing that's what we're going to do one morning we're going to be on inside and right now if you can feel your spiritual Wings start flapping on the inside of you you're like I got to get out of this thing and you're looking around say the signs of the times are everywhere the end time is near but you got those wings are flapping they're one to be we're made for the sky we're not earthborn creatures we're made for the skies once that caterpillar was Earthbound they can now fly we will eat and one day we will burst forth from this body we will flap our ring Wings we are now ready to fly out of this world Earth no longer Earthbound we're going to fly this thing and wave goodbye all because of what we've been eating we have eat our way to a body change apply the blood to your heart put everything under the blood let's stand put everything under the blood and your sins that's covered are no more remembered cuz devil had access to your sins one time but God doesn't even remember it's as though you never did it in the first place what happened down there in Egypt when the death angel passed Pharaoh finally told Moses I want you to take everything you got I want you to take your wives your children your cattle everything don't leave nothing behind and I want you to get out of here one day the devil's going to tell us that we're making him so that one day he's going to finally going to say I can't get you all to do nothing I can't get you to fall all you're doing you're ruining my eeden get out I want you to take your wives take your husbands take your children we're going to take my children and we're going to get out of here but we got news for the devil we're coming back he's just a squatter on this land because we have eaten our way to a body change

got a testimony [Music] um I just wanted to thank the Lord the last couple days um just done some things for me nothing seemed kind of small but it just really touched my heart um uh I think it was Monday I was doing some work under a house in a real Sandy crawl space and um I get out of the crawl space and realize my phone's out of my pocket and it's somewhere under a house somewhere and um so I'm kind of panicking you know going under there with a flashlight looking can't find it trying to call it on a different phone see if the screen will light up because it's course is on silent so you can't hear can't hear it and I'm like man I I can't afford a new phone right now this is really not not good and I'm trying to retrace my my steps and I finally just kind of sat down in the house and said Lord I I I got to find this phone I I have to find it you know please I you could help me and i' about that time I'd like well I don't know maybe I just left it on the truck and I and I just didn't see it and I'm turning to go and something says just turn around one more time and I turn around and my flashlight hit it dead on and I it was buried in sand you couldn't see it oh you barely see the end sticking out of the out of the dirt wow and um so I really appreciate that and then again this morning I had a tool that I use all the time and a little part of it that's kind of important you know if without it the Tool's kind of useless and um I was working on a AC unit and I somehow I dropped that part somewhere in the grass it's I mean tiny little part size your into your pinky and never find it and I'm like well this is like a $40 tool and it it's trash without this I can't you know I got to have this and like well I found my phone yesterday Lord help me find that so I said Lord I need to find this little part could you could you help me and I you know and I looked around and well I don't know maybe I'll just I'll find it later and I turned to walk and I saw it sticking out of the grass just out in the yard where I mean I somehow kicked it and sent it flying I don't know I I mean I couldn't have there's no way you could have found that without the Lord guiding me and said man so I was I was having a good time about it just thinking about it went I was sitting in the in our material trailer just kind of having a good time about it thanking the lord and it just came on my heart so strong about how brother brandom said if you lost your pocket knife and you really needed it he'd put it in your pocket I said man I you know I was just really thinking about that and so got to the end of the day and I was you know packing up the tools getting you know going home and I realized I could not find my pocket knife that I use all the time like well yeah that's about right you know I you know here I am rejoicing over this now my pocket knife's gone and um I get home and I always I got a a bowl that I dump all my stuff in you know my all my keys and wallet and everything and all the screws and wire nuts that in my pockets as well and I always empty my pockets out and I dump it all in there and I put all in there and there's no pocket knife and I'm sitting there talking to my wife and we're just kind of talking and I reach in my pocket and my pocket knife's in my pocket wow and it was not in my pocket there was no way way that was in my pocket I I mean I it it's just there so I I don't know it it just meant a lot to me and amen I I thought maybe itd encourage somebody to hear about it I have a testimony purple so around um well it's probably been almost five or six months now it's about the turn of the Year about 5 months uh we upgraded our phones and there was a little hitch a little hiccup the guy upgraded the wrong phone and so I asked for it and they agreed to upgrade them both for a free promotional upgrade which technically mine apparently wasn't initially supposed to be but they had it all messed up so they agreed they did both well we get the next bill you know and they always say oh it'll show up give it a month or two it didn't show up so I called and contacted oh don't worry it's all coming through it'll be fine next month sure enough it hadn't showed up yet so it was I believe about 4 months in the next time I had called him I was like look it ain't showing up and so the lady says oh well they never even up filled out the form so she said I'll fill out the forms well Meredith's phone shows up right away and mine don't oh Lord have mercy I've called them so many times youall know how it is and so we you know Lord let this work out I I can't deal with these people keep calling them and bugging them and they keep they they'll tell you anything to get you off and so the next month sure enough my phone still hadn't showed up and I kind of in my heart I was like Lord well I've done all I can do I just I guess if they don't if they don't do it then I'll just pay for it technically I guess I initially would have anyway but I kind of forgot about it and um two nights ago Linda my mother-in-law she sends me an email with the bill and it hadn't come out of mine yet again this month thought well let me just look it up so I'll look in the app and you can go to the the uh projected next bill and it had cleared they put it in so praise the Lord [Applause] [Music] well so I guess a maybe last week or the week before um we had that pretty awesome thunderstorm and I'm guilty of bringing that to bufor so um I was doing a roof wash and you basically just spray the chemicals up on the roof and let them do the work and you have have to rinse them off otherwise it's can be a bad deal and I'd clean this one area that was kind of hard to get to multiple times already and just would not clean up like I wanted it to and I was like man all I need I've killed all the stuff that's on the roof with the chemicals I've tried everything I can't get pressure on it and so I was just I had already been looking at the forecast I do every week and I knew that it was supposed to be sunny pretty much all week it was supposed to sprinkle at 4:00 I was like okay well maybe 4:00 we'll roll around it'll help me rinse that off well I mean it barely like sprinkled at all so I was just kind of not loving how it was turning out and I was just like Lord in the Bible we're I we're allowed to hold the sun still so I think I'm allowed to ask for a thunderstorm and so so so I uh you know then it starts getting cloudy and I'm like man I'm not ready for it yet so I still had quite a bit of roof to finish but it was I mean it was just dark the sky just rolled in and uh as soon as I let off the trigger of the pressure washer to rinse the last area I'd left that one spot alone as soon as I finish that last section it just cracks and Thunders explodes and rain starts dumping down for the rest of the night and rinses that area spotless so also I got one more uh the Lord definitely I had a a need for that same business and you know I just really needed a pickup that that green truck that I was rolling it wasn't cutting it and uh yesterday I got the opportunity to buy a pickup I bought a Ford but it's a I'll tell them myself but um it was the way it all happened it was just totally of the Lord and I'm really really thankful and feel very blessed so [Applause] amen God's mindful of the little things he is so I have you to think for my roof leaking okay got time for one more anybody else [Music] got a song on your heart let's sing seek ye first the kingom of God and His [Music] rightousness and all these things shall be added to you oh hallelu Hallelujah ask and it shall be given unto you seek and you shall find knock and it shall be open un to you oh hallelujah hallelujah man shall not live sing it as you go you dismissed but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God
