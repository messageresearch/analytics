[Music] give all of our singers a hand amen our worship team praise the name of the Lord sure enjoying that worship brother Tony had me out of my chair on the first song I hardly could sit back down I was about to have run away praise the Lord but I got to work today so i' get back to get back to it amen so praise the Lord God bless you we're going to invite you right away um into the scripture this morning and um you know I I have a kind of um in in a certain way let me say it this way in a certain way um definitely have a brand new sermon so we definitely have that I don't um I don't at all not taking um you know any anything more Gideon was asking me this morning said Papa we got part 17 coming I'm like no no we uh we finished it amen in the 16 Parts last time but um I have something that's special on my heart and the reason that I say that it's special is because that it's it's studying a sermon that brother Brandon preached which you're all very very familiar with the future home of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride and um I told sister sweetheart today as we were driving to church I said I said honey how old am I she said she thought for a minute she said 60 and I said how many times because she heard me listening to it and I said how many times would you imagine in fact as when we got in the car to drive brother Brandon was just finishing out with a song and closing it out a long sermon and I said how many times you imagine I've heard that song probably a lot and I said yep you wouldn't be wrong I said going all the way back to my childhood when sister Jean played the tapes for the whole neighborhood amen with all the windows open and that reel to reel as fast as one reel run out another reel got put on so uh growing up listening to that sermon then my years at the Tabernacle listening to it again and again then many years as a minister listening to it again and I said well today between yesterday and today I think I finally understand what brother Brandon was trying to get he said after all these years I said yep I said it was um it was far more than I thought it was all these years and I think I really finally am catching his real Vision so in that regard today I'm going to invite you to Isaiah chapter 65 and I've um I've got three places I'm going to read I only sent the booth two places but we're going to uh after we go here we're going to hit second Peter but then I want to hit Revelation 21 so sorry to jump you brother Mark but we're gonna we're going to do that third passage amen you love the Lord praise God I want to take a title today a brand new book a brand new book Isaiah 65 I'm not going to find it in Isaiah 29 Isaiah 65 and I want to just catch two verses and then we're going to move right to Second Peter want to catch verse 17 and 18 for behold I create new heavens and a new Earth and the former shall not be remembered nor come into mind but be glad and rejoice forever in that which I create for behold I create Jerusalem a rejoicing and her people a joy that lovely your Future's bright friends amen second Peter chapter 3 this morning want to go right here and catch uh from this great Apostle here in second Peter I used to know where second Peter was thank you sir right after first Peter appreciate that Mo amen right before third Peter amen I was in a in a church service one time big packed out church and the Pastor said we want to invite everybody to turn to the 23rd chapter of Revelation and Men sister Jean were the only ones who didn't reach for our Bible the whole church was you know looking where in the world and she looked at me and smiled real big and I felt happy to be well instructed in in the scripture amen second Peter chapter 3 and we're going to catch verses 1 to 18 and then I'll probably let you be seated uh as we read Revelation because this is lengthy The Second Epistle beloved I now write unto you in both which I stir up your pure Minds by way of remembrance that you may be mindful of The Words which were spoken before by the holy prophets now you we started with the words of the Holy prophets in Isaiah right where he says I'm going to make Jerusalem a rejoicing I'm going to make her people a joy right amen all right by the holy prophets and of the Commandment of us the Apostles of the Lord and Savior knowing this first that there shall come in the last days scoffers walking after their own lust and saying where is the promise of his coming for since the fathers fell asleep all things contined as they were from the beginning of the creation so when you think like that you stop watching and we were commanded to watch and wait and be ready and keep till he comes but when you remember Jesus said but when the people realized that he seemed to delay then they just went on about their business remember when Moses was gone a long time and the people rose up to play so this is this is the danger that when you follow this kind of Spirit on the age and it's on the whole age to just to get you to think man nothing's really changed I've heard the Lord's coming my whole life be careful see because I'm today I'm come with a revelation that I know the very hour he coming the hour you think not for this they willingly are ignorant of that by the word of God the heavens were of old this is prior to the to Noah's destruction and the Earth standing out of the water and in the water this is the Genesis world whereby the world that then was now Here Comes the Flood being overflowed with water perished but the heavens and the Earth which are now by the same word are kept in store reserved under Fire against the day of judgment and predition of ungodly men but beloved be not ignorant of this one thing that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day the Lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but his longsuffering to us were not willing that any should perish isn't that lovely but that all should come to repentance so after all it's just the patience and love of God is why we're still here but the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night first of all because people have stopped looking for it they've let their guard down in the which the heavens will shall pass away with a great noise and the elements shall burn with fervent heat the Earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved everything you chase in this world it's all going to Ash and Cinder see so where are your priorities what is it you're chasing what is it you're trying to accomplish are you living this life as if it's about this life please this life is not about this life it's about the one that Peter's writing about here the one coming see but the day of the Lord that's always judgment will come as a thief in the night in the which the heaven shall pass away with a great noise the elements shall melt with fervent heat the Earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness that's a fair question wouldn't you say seeing that all these things are passing away and they're going to be destroyed with fervent heat will and he's going to come as a thief in the night and it's going to happen then what what kind of person ought we to be looking for and hastening un the coming of the day of God wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved and the elements shall melt with fervent heat nevertheless we according to the promise look for now this is the third iteration of the world nevertheless we according to his promise look for new heavens and a new Earth wherein dwelleth righteousness wherefore beloved seeing that you look for such things be diligent that you may be found of him in peace without spot and blameless and account that the longsuffering of Our Lord is salvation even our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him ha written unto you as also in all his Epistles speaking in them of these things in which are some things hard to be understood which they that are unlearned and unstable rest as they do also the scriptures unto their own destruction so when you when you refuse the messenger to your age that's that doesn't end well verse 17 you therefore beloved seeing you know these things before beware lest ye also being led away with the error of the wicked fall from your own steadfastness now he's not saying losing your salvation you're suddenly unborn again but there is the ability if you don't stay on your toes to lose your steadfastness in what in in all holy conversation and godliness see you lose your steadfastness but now here's here's here's what you do grow in Grace how many say Amen to that grow in Grace growing in Grace doesn't mean that I'm understanding Grace more so I can live looser Grace the Bible says Grace teaches us to deny ungodliness see all right so don't don't turn Grace into a misuse of Grace and make it a disgrace but growing grace and in the knowledge of our our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ to him be glory both now and uh forever amen all right now you can be seated and we're going to read from Revelation um 21 Revelation 21 you're going to see that everything I'm reading is all the same theme I move that back a little bit Brother Brad because I could hear the wind noise hitting it so all right now we want to catch vers Revelation 21: 1:5 and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there was no more sea and I John saw the holy city the New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband so first thing I want you to notice is the the correlation of the city with the bride and and he he's he's making them together in fact is when the angel who had the seventh vial said I will show you the bride the Lamb's wife and he saw a city so you can see that they are correlated together now that's going to mean a lot as we go forward and I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband and I heard a great voice out of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself God himself God himself himself the first time in the Bible it's saying this it's never been God himself it's always in an office he's always in the in an angel Joshua met him as a soldier Gideon met him in a certain way Moses met him in a certain way this is the same God that said I Moses I can't go down in the midst of these people because they're stiff necked and rebellious plus the fact that there's no blood sacrifice of the Lamb of God so even the righteous people would get SL slaughtered he said I can't dwell among you but I'll send my angel see I'll come in an office I'll come in a form to where I'll come in a Ministry to where I I can be among you and Lead You and I can I can push off judging you I can push it off I can push off judgment waiting for the Lamb of God because my eventual idea is to dwell with you and be in you amen all right now watch and they behold the Tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain Hallelujah for the former things are passed away and he that sat upon the throne this is quite an image he that sat upon the throne said behold I make all things new and he said unto me right for these words are true and faithful amen now I I I intentionally did not put any quotes on PowerPoint today because I first of all I don't want to get bound to them I I want to as as Katie my daughter-in-law says I want to Freestyle a little bit amen so but I'm going to read through them and and I really only have one that I'm going to read at length um but I but I I want to try to get this first concept to you now this is the very first important point that you're going to understand and as many times as I read over this to me the future home of the of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride was just telling me about the city I'm going to go live in and I preached on it and did a and did a a a a diagram and showed you know modeled the Holy Mountain on the earth and showed you a picture of the globe with that on it and we measured the square miles and the and the and you know I forget how many seven you know seven million or more seven I think 7.3 million square miles of of land and something like 4.5 billion acres of land so that's just the city see because its base is is 1500 miles by 1500 miles so so it it's all the way from you know from Maine to Florida and west of the Mississippi and you know up to the Canadian border so it's a big chunk of land like half this nation and so and that's going to rise up higher than the space shuttle flies the space shuttle today I'm sorry the International Space Station orbits at the at the Foothills level of this mountain this thing's High way way up there I mean it it's going to need new atmosphere around it amen so the whole earth will be lighted by by the by the that Pillar of Fire hanging in the top of it Jesus the light of the world so so now I thought you know that it's it's just all about that however watch watch what how brother Brandon almost like an opening volley he first he starts cover ing uh this is out of paragraph 73 74 75 76 77 78 I'm just skipping along it you can find and study at home it's a great message you're going to want to listen to it after today especially and so so we we find that he goes right to where we read in our scripture that there was a world the Genesis world that stood out of the water then that world got an deluvian destruction but that that world didn't pass away you understand it just got drowned you know everybody except eight Souls uh lost their lives and then he says to Noah the very thing he said to Adam now now multiply and replenish so we find then that that's the world that has survived to now and we're still living since the flood to now so we're in the second iteration of the same world and then brother brandham says you know he starts talking about how the old world that stood out of the water the one that is present that we live on and he said and then the world to come so that's three worlds or three stages of the world so he he he's showing that now because remember that our that a big point is that the city is the bride and the bride is the city and they correlate so now he's going to say look that you've got the world the Earth and you're built out of the Earth understand so just like you had to come by the three works of Grace amen through water blood and spirit see and so you were you were baptized and then you and that's justification you're baptized then there's sanctification it's all the work of the Holy Ghost but then there's that fiery baptism that actually brings the gene of God to life now because now we explain it that way way because of the way He restored the ages okay so we a lot of times I'm I'm sorry I'm going have to take my jacket off because the um the back device got broken that pins it to my collar and I can feel it tugging on me it's going to distract me the whole time so amen all right praise the Lord amen so so we find that that he says now it's water blood life that's the way a baby comes water breaks blood then life see and so you have to come through those three works of Grace and as I was saying we explain it almost like a a process that you've got to go through and because we're we're correlating that to How He restored the word down Through the Ages many people get the they they think too too much on that first I need to repent and get Justified and then the next thing I need to do I'm not quite born again yet I've repented but now I got to go get baptized well I'm still not born again now I got to get Sanctified and then if I live Sanctified long enough and I do a good enough job and get an A on my report card then he'll give me the Holy Ghost and the token and the and the baptism and the new birth but but we only are describing it that way because that's the way the Ages were restored but the new birth all of those are to come in a moment amen when when it's when it's really the holy ghost moving and compelling you and he has broken your heart and you repent of your sins it's not just a repenting of your past sins it's a literal repenting of everything you have been everything you are and you don't want to be you anymore you want to be him you're tired of the world and it's genuine and it's real and when you I'm here to tell you you don't have to wait 10 days you don't have to wait 10 hours you don't have to wait 10 seconds you can come to Christ and the baptism of the Holy Spirit Will justify and sanctify and make you a new creation in Christ Jesus it's not hard to get the Holy Ghost is not hard to get young people but the reason people don't get it is because they only have a partial repentance they don't really they're not they don't really surrender everything and the reason they don't really surrender everything is because they're not not willing to give up everything and when that's the condition of your heart that's the that's where brother Bram talks about the Box Car see the box car is not your report card how how well are you are you making the great it's your heart when he sees that inside that heart that that's not real faith that you're holding back you'll never be born again you'll come to church you'll be a better person you'll live a Sanctified life but but I'm here to tell you your desires of your heart it'll still be just you gritting your teeth trying to be a Christian CU you don't want to go to hell and you don't want to go on a tribulation and you'd very much like to go to this new city so would I no kidding so would everybody but I'm here to tell you you've got to have a fiery baptism of the Holy Spirit and that's why when he baptized it in water in Noah's day God himself still couldn't dwell on the earth it wasn't fit for him to dwell in even when Jesus blood ran down the cross and touched the Earth and Sanctified it he still couldn't do it and even in the Millennium it's not God himself dwelling with us it's Christ Jesus you understand but you don't get to Revelation 21 until there is not a not an atomic fire at the end of the tribulation but a holy fire at the end of the Millennium and then it's a f place for God himself to dwell upon with his people amen amen this is Brother branham's opening volley what God has done to redeem his world he's done the same plan to redeem his people and you need to get that right off the bat three stages of Grace We're very familiar and fond of quoting in paraphrase because few people quote it verbatim paraphrases close enough how that brother brandham after the seals talks about his Bible becoming a brand new book and that's true he said that that's true but but I I I want to broaden your mind to understand that that wasn't in his mind that wasn't a one-off brother brandham had been making that statement for years depending on what was happening the earliest instance I could find was 1955 and what he's referring to is is the New Birth by a spiritual Revelation and so he says it's been it's been ever since once he ever gave a spiritual Revelation to the 120 people in the upper room and and they accepted that and when they and when they and then and then they were baptized in the Holy Ghost and then when Peter preached to these to all these these devout Jews and he gave them the word of the hour not the word they had they had had the word they were devout Jews they had the law of Moses but now he gave them the message of the hour which is the Lamb has come you killed him but God would not allow him the grave couldn't hold him for David had said I'll not leave his soul in hell and this same Jesus who you crucified has been made both Lord and Christ and when they heard that message what must we do why did they ask that cuz they were concerned why were they concerned cuz they believed it and when they and they said what's the message of the hour repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and when they followed that then the church was added to daily and they got the Holy Ghost and the evidence that they got the Holy Ghost is in verse 441 that after they were baptized they continued steadfastly with the apostles teaching and doctrine of the breaking of bread so the new birth isn't hard to identify it's when you can say Amen to every word and so he says it was a spiritual re Revelation from God this is 1955 the glorified Jesus and it's been ever since spiritually revealed truth how God in his Mercy through the operation of the Holy Spirit reveals the truth the word itself if you're trying to read it if you're trying to read it from some educational standpoint you just read it like you was trying to figure out mathematically something but if you read it after you have received Christ in your heart it's a brand new book he goes on 1956 contending for the faith he starts talking about when he was uh in Jerusalem and he he met a bishop of the Methodist Church brother brandham you know we don't accept you as a missionary because you westerners y'all don't know how to read the Bible it's an Eastern book and he starts talking about this you people in the west with your Western education does not understand the scripture and the right of an oriental book and that's true brother R says with all of our theology if you ever go to Jerusalem or to the Eastern country and he starts talking about in the in the or he's got one here I'm going to read next where he's in India and and India is part of Asia and so he says he says when you go there to the Eastern country where the Bible was written it's a brand new book to you so now it's tied to an event you understand it's tied to a happening so so so when he says you've been born again that's a happening not brand new book when you actually go to the east where it was written and you understand it by the culture that you're you're mingling around in I any brother in here that has been to the to Israel can tell you that this took on new meaning in so many places everybody of ever Christian have ever heard that went there come back and said I understand my Bible so much better now so he comes in 1960 Queen of Sheba he's in Bombay India they're trying to tell him that you know that same that same appeal and he agrees with it he says that it's an Eastern book If you ever go to the east it becomes a brand new book when you read it up here in the west we try to make an Eastern book compared with the Western way of living you can't do it he's talking about a lot of those types and shadows you don't understand what's happening in the Bible 1962 now's progressing along and I'm skipping a bunch of them and I'm just reading pieces of quotes 62 questions and answers he says look back when I look back where I once was now I'm above that why because his grace Lifted Me Up you say Amen you remember that day and here I am now seated in Heavenly places in Christ oh my there you are now that's a listen friends that very scripture has such depth of meaning because he's saying this standing in a pull pit on the Terra Firma he's standing on Earth saying now that I'm in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and that's where you are you're sitting here in a building but you're but there's another you that's in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and I would say when you've been born again of the spirit of God it's the more real you say so some some part of me is way off beyond the Milky Way stop thinking of it as somewhere beyond the misty blue the Bible said he's right here near right here around all of us he's not far from any of you it's just dimensional it's just dimensional it's not it's not Multiverse like the science fiction writers think it is it is in a sense but it's dimensional layers see so so he says here when I look back at what I once was now I'm above that by his grace he Lifted Me Up and here I am now seated in Heavenly places in Christ oh my there you are then the Bible becomes a new book then you're reading it through spiritual eyes and spiritual understanding amen so now don't lose sight of the fact that I'm preaching on today my title is a brand new book all right so here he comes now um 1964 the identified Christ of all ages until you come in behind the badger skin nice you know correlating with the Tabernacle in the wilderness in the wilderness that Moses erected until you come in behind that Badger skin I suppose the temple as well until you get out of your old skin your old thoughts your old Creeds friends don't claim you are born again if you're still got your old thoughts your old Creeds if you haven't died to you you're never been born to him Hallelujah if you not come behind that and and you still have your old skin and your old thoughts and your old Creeds here's his advice come into the presence of God and then when the word becomes a living reality to you what does that even mean it means that it's it's no longer on printed page it's not ink on paper it's the word behind skin that this has become a reality inside of you and you're now the Living Word when that has happened see when the word becomes a living reality to you then you're awakened to the Shina Glory the thing nobody else sees they think you're weird they think it's Ault they don't see it as Shina of Glory that's why they think that you wouldn't see it as Shina of Glory either but you've went behind the veil and a supernatural thing has happened and your eyes have been opened thank you Lord so what the world looks at as weird and strange and cult and as a cult you look at it as the shikina glob Glory then the Bible becomes a new book then Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever finally he comes here in 1965 power God's power to transform this is the one people often refer to people that feel the same way that I do and the way I have been for many years but since the opening of those Seven Seals of them Angels just behind the mountain Yonder this meaning his Bible this has become a new book it's the things that's been hidden that's been hid is being revealed as God promised in Revelation 10 that he would do it's not just Doctrine people ate the book and became the book it's not just Doctrine you might not even understand all of the doctrines but the the the the Christ is not a book He's a person the message is not books and tapes and quotes it's a person it's Christ you you where's the where's the Book of Life where's where's the open book it's in the bride because she's eaten the book invisible Union and this is actually the last one I have in that vein 1965 now your old book now here here's the reason I got this one now we're going all the way and this is going to work for you in the in the long this is the long game when you've been born again when you were born in the earth your name was put in the book of life right it's a book of names it's every name that's ever existed and even if there's a few scant names and brother brandham talks about maybe like Pharaoh it's ambiguous what that means we don't know for sure but brother brandham does also go on to say even though his name wasn't in the book he said I'm sure there was a record of him somewhere because life is precious to God and so so we realize that your name was in The Book of Life Now on the Judgment when you know when the when the one is seated there the one that Isaiah saw him high and lifted up and his filled the temple in Isaiah 6 right right amen Daniel comes through Daniel 7 Daniel 9 that Daniel 11 all these teachings and he says I saw the Ancient of Days Seated on the throne So Daniel sees him amen so so you you this is the same exact one this is now now we find that John comes and John says uh in that he sees a throne and he said I saw one seated on the throne Hallelujah and then we read it in our text he sat on the throne you remember in in Revelation 20 that the the the the heavens peeled back the the dead both small and great stood before him remember that and the books were opened and another book was opened which was the book of life and the dead were judged out of the by their works out of the books and then after that then after because if you look Matthew 25 and Revelation 20 agree in their sequence because the first ones he's speaking to is the is the righteous who are who were not born again but they're being judged by their works out of the books and they were found to be righteous works the foolish virgin and those different ones and then they're placed on the right and then next come the next one and they get put on the left because they're they're being judged by their works also but their Works according to the books are found to be works of iniquity yeah see and so then then the Bible says that all whose names were not found in the book were cast into the Lake of Fire where death and hell and the Beast and the devil and the false prophet are and and the new heavens and the new earth begin in Earnest so so you've got this one seated on the throne and and and this judgment is going now the Bride As I said to you last time she's part of the processing crew she's part of the team she's on the throne she's already been fully vetted and her identity was found to be in Christ so he says your old book now this is when you're born again this is not then this is now when your old book is gone with your old Union remember Paul covers that in Romans 7 I speak to them that know the law how that a woman having a living husband if she be married she shall be caught an adulterous but if her husband be dead then she's no longer under that and she's free to remarry right so now your old Union your old Union that you were born with that Fallen birth that you came into the world with no chance at all to save yourself no matter how good you would ever be there's value in being good but that can't give you eternal life you understand you have to be given by eternal life given eternal life by the only one who can give it and he's the source of eternal life he is eternal life he's that same Fountain before he ever said let there be light and the heavens and the Earth were created that Fountain was in existence amen so so he he says here your old book now is gone with your old Union your name in your old has been transferred now you say do you mean to tell me that my old book brother B says God put it in the sea of his forgetfulness you stand perfectly before God now your name is now in the new book not the book of life but the Lamb's Book of Life what the lamb redeemed not the old book of your natural Union but your new bride Hallelujah your new life is in the Lamb's Book of Life your marriage certificate where your true Eternal germ from the beginning takes hold see you always had it but when you're born again it takes hold see now you're not only forgiven but you're Justified and we know what that means as as though you never did it in the first place as if you had never been born in sin so your your record then becomes you know it's not it looks like two books brother the ROM clears it up later it's not two books it's one book it's dis sectioned and so therefore whatever was held against you in the in the book of life is now gone it's gone it's gone and the only identity of you that remains is Jesus Christ because it's the Lamb's Book of Life and you're when they look at you they identify you as him I identify as Jesus Christ and his bride Hallelujah like to say to the world I identify as the bride of Christ I would only ask that you respect me and support me in my identity man confirm you accept it we might get along so now when you look at when you look down through the history of the Bible the Bible you know you remember Paul talks about those old Veterans of the Old Testament era and he said you know they were for our examples these things were written for our admonition so that we could learn we could not only learn you know understand the god that we know better because now we can see him in Shadow and we can understand how we got to where we are because we can see him getting there back here in their lives this is why you can find an Old Testament character if you get in a problem just go see how they got out of the same problem and however God had dealt with them he'll deal with you so when we we can see Abraham and we can see that Abraham was called of God but it's it's a little hard to focus on when he's when he when a famine strikes the land and this prophet of God who God Called to be the father of Nations and the father of Faith suddenly gets scared and leaves the promised land and goes down to Egypt and anytime a Jew leaves the promised land he's backslid see and so you find even Abraham now showing a backsliding condition he's down there he's lying to Pharaoh he's getting his wife to lie CU that thing passes on to the generations after you and and and and now she's she's part of the lie and part of the scheme and he almost dies he almost loses her they pick up you know here here they pick up Hagar this Egyptian slave and as I've said for years Israel is still paying for that one to this day they're paying for that one and so you find that of course God used it it has to be contrast Ishmael had to come forward and then he's going to persecute the the the promised child and so you you know the story and then you find that you say okay well that was just one little fauxie Abraham will never do that again and he didn't until he got in trouble again and then that ticking time bomb that is in him because he was born in sin that's in you when you're born in sin and all that ticking Time Bomb all it is a pressure bomb and all it needs is for you to get enough pressure and it'll blow and you think you've beat it and you think you've conquered it just get under enough pressure one time get in the wrong place let your prayer life get slacked let your church schedule get slacked let your fellowship get get slack and you'll find out that this old flesh still has lots of time bombs they're ticking time bombs just waiting for the right opportunity thanks be to God you don't have to fear him because greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world and the Holy Ghost has the ability because there's a new me on the inside which is really him as me and now it can bring these ticking time bombs under under control and so Abraham there he is again with ailec and he's lying again same old lie same old fear same old thing almost dies almost lose his wife the whole thing goes sideways on him and and you know the the story I don't need to spend all this time on it but you're going to find that when you follow that in Genesis then the king mzc comes to in the cool of the evening it says about this time according to the time of life I'll visit you you know Sarah laughed why'd she laugh I didn't yes you did you said this but you shall indeed have a son and when he had that son now you've got a new office now it's not just Father Abraham now God has moved in his Bible imagery into sunship and now the very promise is starting to take hold and once sunship came on the scene Abraham never made that mistake again I'm here to tell you once the Son of God comes into your life and into my life Abraham became a new book and you become a brand new book Jacob did the same thing followed his dad they're all lying they're shyers he I I loved that sermon uh brother Caleb preached recently my goodness spoke to me so deeply on Jacob and you know and brother B talks about man when you're goingon to you really got to have some Grace well about believing Jacob to be in the lineage of Christ it really going to take some Grace cuz this guy was all time lying conniving cheating scheming Prophet calls him a Shyer and but you know something and and this was the point that that that Caleb was making and and I just was listening to a tape right as he had preached that and I was listening to a tape and brother Brandon was talking about that very thing how that finally he got a hold of he said for one time in his life he had an experience something he could get his hands on something he had had experiences with God he had made a pillow and he saw angels ascending and descending and a ladder attached from Heaven to Earth and he saw the Son of God standing there talking to him he had all kinds of things but he still goes from there and still lying and still cheating but I'm here to tell you finally he come to an experience and it changed him it wasn't just another experience it wasn't just another church service it wasn't just another good sermon it wasn't just another time at the altar but something for the first time could alter his life and he became a prince he became a new book called The Prince called Israel same thing with Moses he became a new book after he was a runaway Prophet yeah brother bandam said all he had to show for his calling was one dead Egyptian in the sand rotting and stinking and he's standing there on and he says he's thinking about his life here he is and he says I thought he says Moses I'm glad a prophet can look back and catch that inspiration and he said one day Moses stood there and he thought about his life and what what opportunities he had had and squandered and blew it and he says and now I'm old now I'm 80 years old now it's too late it's too late for me I've wasted too much time got too much baggage here I am I'm supposed to be a deliverer my people are still in bondage I'm just a simple sheep harder and and and and he says brother I'm says and great Crystal tears began to roll down his beard and he said then he heard the sound of that crackling flame and he looked to see and he said I'll turn aside oh turn aside today friends you can become a brand new book you can meet with God like you've never met with him before that's my prayer I pray that after even after brother Caleb preached that I started praying saying Lord give me an oldfashioned refilling of the Holy Ghost something I can put my hands on at a level I've never known say you've been in this a long time you've had some levels you're right I've had some levels but I want a level that I've never known I want that fresh dynamics that fresh surge of the holy ghost in my life I thought it was falling out here this morning when brother Tony started with that song I started to run out the door it's here hallelujah i' had have probably jumped from here to the back door Peter became a brand new book All Through the Bible you can read these people that they became a brand new book now he's not he's not denying he's not swearing he's not angry he's not got a temper he's standing there humbly believing God's word and the Holy Spirit so comes upon him when they go to crucify him his he has a request not spare my life but please don't crucify me like my Lord why not because I'm not worthy to die like he did what do you want us to do I want you to turn me upside down and crucify me upside down I'm here to tell you Peter was a brand new book after the opening of the word the Bride of this day has been given a brand new book to feed on and after the opening of the word in this day the Bride of this day the bride has become herself a brand new book around the world she's become a brand new book I'm here to tell you something friends that's a that's a book for the ages a book for eternity think about it just think about what God has done to this bride predestinated to become a brand new book predestinated to become a living Bible you you yourself predestinated to be a Living Word at the end time you in your very person you see you're not marked for Destruction that's right many B billions are marked for Destruction even the good the unwise Virgin and the remnant of the woman's seed even they'll go down in that terrible time we we were talking about some of those issues last Sunday and in the 16th part of that series but I am not marked and I I I want I want me to know it I'm not marked for Destruction I'm predestinated to not fall I'm ordained to stand there Hallelujah I'm not marked for Destruction I'm predestinated to live in a brand new world I'm ordained to live in a brand new city is that how you feel today in our opening text of Isaiah for behold I create a new heavens and a new Earth and the former shall not be remembered nor come in to mind there's quite a bit of pain and heartbreak in this life we live and the devil has seen to it that he has been able to maximize every weakness and in your armor we try to be Christians even even with the Holy Ghost we still stumble we still make mistakes imagine how we were before we had the Holy Ghost amen I just think people should once they get off their high horse don't ever get on him again see Paul talks about about like Paul says you know of the things that you put your members to back then things you don't even want to speak of and a lot of pain and a lot of heartbreak and a lot of loss there's been tremendous loss we've all experienced it here today and any one of us could stand up and and give a story of great pain and suffering and tremendous loss that we've suffered and some stories would be worse than others and some would would take minutes for you to start crying and some you'd cry almost immediately that life has been hard life and job said it's just a few days it's full of Sorrow it's full of trouble don't don't chase this world no wonder Jesus said don't lay up Treasures here lay them up there see if you lay them up here then thieves can take them moth and rust can corrupt them but put them somewhere Hallelujah put them somewhere beyond the beyond the sun beyond the clouds put them somewhere friends where they're safe put them somewhere where you'll find them again in that new world been quite a bit of pain quite a bit of heartbreak and I I I I can give you this word of comfort today for a heartbreak that you've had for a heartbreak that may await you still the former shall not be remembered nor come into mind oh oh for that hour oh for that day when all sorrow is over and all pain is done and all loss I'll never lose anything again often times loss can bring numbing anguish it can bring bewilderment and we can sit sometimes and just stupified can't even speak the anguish of the loss is so great but he says be glad and rejoice forever in that which I create for behold I create Jerusalem are rejoicing and I create her people of Joy I know we've had pain but joy is coming Hallelujah I know we've had loss but it's going to be new again Hallelujah he's bringing that back to us friends that's what the word has restored to us in this hour watching the clock let me just catch a few more points I don't know if I'll finish this today it's doubtful he says here he says in these passages nice meaning where we read in Peter heavens and earth will pass away remember that and it all dissolved with a fervent heat and I saw a new Heavens in the new Earth remember that really dire language my goodness it just sounds like total annihilation of everything but brother brandham is going to point out that the Earth and I don't have that particular quote here but the Earth is an eternal attribute of God and therefore it can never be annihilated see so now remember that city is you and you are that City and there's a you and there's that City that you're going to live in it and it's going to be on an earth that can't be annihilated because there's a part of you that can't be annihilated amen he says with these passages one might think or be led rather to believe that the whole planet of this Earth will be destroyed speaking about Peter's language I make a new Heaven and a new Earth see that the heavens will be gone the Earth will be gone completely annihilated but a close study and with the help of the Holy Spirit we can see the truth of this and that's what we're going into it is only the atmospheres around it and the sin that's upon the Earth Earth that will be destroyed see now we realize that the heavens means the atmospheres above see so what does it do it then these watch this these thistles and sickness and death and politics and sinful man and sinful woman and evil spirits will all be gone away and annihilated GL hallu yes there there there's a world that was and we read stories about it and we we find out that it got to a point after the fall mankind broke it God built it perfect mankind broke it and then he went on from there just doing the best he could feel to do in his own head and however he you know scoffield talks about you know the the the dispensation of conscience where every man did that which was right in his own eyes brother ROM you know um seem to to confirm those those U those those break that breakdown and so so we find that he got to the point where the Bible says this really all we know we know that mankind around the world got to the point where globally his mind of all Humanity was evil continually see so that means that his mind stayed evil even when he went to church but there was one Church being built that didn't look much like a church it looked like a stone mountain made perfectly and they called it a pyramid and there was a builder who was the pastor who had a great revelation of God and he actually built the revelation of the Redeemer in his church and he got so under in such understanding of the word of God he got by by by doing by letting the Revelation work through him he went in a Rapture that's what did it he let the he let the revelation of the word raise him higher and higher and higher until one day he was closer to there than he was to here and God said you're so close you might as well come on in oh I'd like to go up to his door and say Lord he say come on in Hallelujah praise but we find that the whole rest of the world except for Noah and his family they built an arc to the saving of their family and they alone and then we had the world that is now and we've got that world that's that's here to this very hour and it's it's full of thistles and sickness and death and politics and sinful man and sinful women I mean it's listen friends you can go out here and you you can go to to the big rallies on on both sides of the of the of the evil Pond both sides of the sickening Quagmire and you can see their big buildings and their big rallies and their High platforms and their politicians and you're seeing politics and sinful men and sinful women and sickness and death and evil spirits I'm here to tell you you can see schools you can see buildings you can see hospitals you can see shopping plazas but it's all going to be annihilated that will that evil will never be on that new world he says it's all gone away and annihilated it has to be done that way because we're going to live right hereen so the beauty of it comes down to this and here's where I'll hit my pause button today I relish the understanding of the word that I can never die I have eternal life you are looking at a man who can never die this body just a temporary house it might lay down and go back to the soil and even that won't matter because when the trumpet sounds even those elements will come back beginning with with brother Eddie when we put his casket beneath the sod I said now folks I told sister mom I said I said listen here's all we're doing y'all we're just storing his Temple were storing his body this is not him he's already shouting and running he's had many days he ain't even finished shaking hands and hugging necks yet eventually he'll come back and pick this body back up and it'll be changed and he'll be glorified right now he's in a theophany but then he'll pick these elements up because you were always a part of the earth he's a he's Redeeming the Earth the same way he's redeeming you and therefore the Earth can't be annihilated I can't be annihilated when it's all said and done I'll still be alive and well and I'll be living right here what is he doing brother Jason what is he doing he's changing my atmospheres listen we' all have to admit today that sin has introduced quite a few atmospheres into our life sin has brought and and has created atmospheres that dwell within us and we call them complexes we call them weaknesses and they emanate out from us and they harm all of those around us and the cycle of pain and the cycle of complex it just keeps going on and on and on but I'm here to tell you my new book is annihilating the atmospher Hallelujah I'm not going to have to live there forever like this I'm getting a new body and a new mind and he's transforming my mind to believe his word amen sin you would admit with me it's introduced quite a few bad atmospheres within us a casual faith in the message of the hour is the most harmful atmosphere you can pass along to your loved ones it's the most harmful atmosphere you can be in possession of and it's the it'll do the most damage to those you care about the most amen there's never been a person from The Upper Room till now that has survived that lack of faith without incurring much needless need not have been pain and loss from the upper room to now no one whoever had that lacking of a fervent Faith call it a casual Faith but I'm talking about the lack of a f a fervent faith and we've all been there come on let's own it let's own it we've all been there I I'm glad you know I I'm glad when when that was my level that he didn't destroy me Hallelujah he didn't annihilate me he only annihilated my casual Faith he only annihilated my love of the world he he gave me a love for a new home and his word it became a new book to me and I became a new book to him Hallelujah my name was taken from the book of life and put in the Lamb's Book of Life and from there it can never pass away Hallelujah Heaven's Earth will pass away but his word cannot pass away he changed my atmosphere he's still doing it today he's still doing it today he's still trans transforming my mind I'm still getting a a renewal I'm not being conformed to this world but I'm being transformed by the renewing of my mind he's annihilating everything the curse of sin put on me can you be glad for that today say oh brother Jason I see this sermon future home in a deeper way than I ever have I'm glad because so do I oh Hallelujah friends he's annihilating everything the curse of sin put on me as what we were saying last Sunday oh I'd love to keep preaching but I got to stop I can see what's ahead of me let me say this while Fallen Humanity is busy annihilating themselves by the misuse of creation power that's what Atomic power is it's Genesis power and sinful man got a hold of it we were we you you heard Annie Jacobson Jacobson talking last Sunday about how that she said in the 20th century mankind invented the nuclear bomb to stop evil and now in the 21st century it's that same thing that's going to bring an Extinction of it going to annihilate Humanity from existence and I'm not just talking about when the bride is gone and the world enters the time called Jacob's trouble what we commonly call the tribulation period Bible says there's never been a time left like it before there'll NE thank God there will never be another time like it afterwards we find that it's not I'm not just talking about Humanity annihilating themselves in that time that's that will be in in in some degrees inconsequential to me because I'll be at a table thousands of miles long I'll be Reaching Across to Abraham Isaac and Jacob oh I'll be saying Brothers oh what an encouragement David yeah you were King I used to read about your life it so encouraged me because I could see God loved you and even when you fell yeah we read about that I'm sorry it got put in a book but it encouraged me to if he loved you that way he could love me that way hallelujah oh my but when they're because the point I want to make is that they're doing it now they're annihilating themselves now the world is being prepared and conditioned under the ministry of a false prophet in the Book of Revelation an antichrist false prophet who's literally preaching them right into a tribulation while a real Prophet is preaching me right into a body change Hallelujah the perfect contrast to God's God and Satan's plan perfect contrast between them and while they are busy annihilating their self their very existence God is busy using his creative power for something else he's annihilating all right he's using his power to remove all the Fallen parts from me he's leaving the only thing he's leaving of you is the vision he had of you before the foundation of the world oh let's stand to our feet Amen brother Tony come if you if it's you coming or whoever's coming amen praise the Lord oh I I I love that Holy life I love that Holy way I want to sing that again if we can brother Kenny you know that one right oh you're kin booze man you can do it amen amen I love that Holy Life kid don't get wrong everybody's counting on you amen friends I hope that you can have that kind of a feeling in your heart today to say Lord God first I want to say thank you that I'm not marked for for Destruction amen thank you that I'm a new book and I'm feeding on a new book and I'm becoming a new book and I'm being renewed every day and I I do want Annihilation Lord I just don't want it to annihilate me I want it to annihilate all the atmospheres everything that sin hung on me I want it Anni ated how many how many how many is that is that your desire raise up those hands let the Lord see it say I want those all of those complexes all of that lack of faith all of those weaknesses all of those problems oh I want them annihilated from my life Lord hands up all over the building father I I'd have Lov to have kept going but we're going to stop right there because I feel in my heart that the the arrow of Deliverance was shot from your throne today and has found its Mark oh God found its Mark may may I trust that it has burrowed deep into the heart of your children today that they might say I want that Holy life Lord I want to be a brand new book I want to be renewed I want to make sure that my name has been transferred not just the book of life but I want to make sure that all my identity is transferred into Christ in the Lamb's Book of Life that I am now identified with him I'm identified with the sacrifice that Christ is not just what he was 2,000 years ago on the cross but what he that plus what he's done plus what he is right
