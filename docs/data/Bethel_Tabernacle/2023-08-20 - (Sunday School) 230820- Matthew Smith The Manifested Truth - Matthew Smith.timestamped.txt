[0:04] all right good morning everybody
[0:06] so I'll Stand and have a word of Prayer
[0:10] oh gracious father Lord we're inviting
[0:13] you into this little Sunday school lore
[0:16] that you would
[0:17] come down and speak to our hearts Lord
[0:18] that these few words that I would have
[0:21] would be
[0:22] anointed by you father that I would say
[0:24] what you would have me say Lord that the
[0:26] people would be able to be edified by it
[0:28] and
[0:29] they'd be able to
[0:31] grow and and maybe hear something that
[0:34] would give him some encouragement and
[0:35] some medification father we ask these
[0:37] things in Jesus name amen
[0:40] you all can
[0:41] um let's let's go ahead and read a
[0:42] scripture while I got you standing
[0:44] um
[0:46] let's turn to
[0:48] um
[0:50] turn to Hebrews chapter 6 and verse 13.
[0:56] uh 13.
[0:58] Hebrews 6 13.
[1:07] um
[1:08] yeah it says for when God made promise
[1:10] to Abraham because he could swear by no
[1:13] greater he swear by himself saying
[1:15] surely
[1:17] blessing I Will Bless thee in
[1:18] multiplying I will multiply thee and so
[1:20] after he had patiently endured he
[1:23] obtained the promise
[1:25] you all can be seated
[1:27] um
[1:28] so
[1:32] seems I was
[1:34] I was listening to
[1:36] um a um
[1:38] a news
[1:39] broadcast the other day and there was a
[1:42] guy he was talking about how the the
[1:45] news has changed a lot over the years
[1:48] how you know it used to be back in the
[1:50] day that people wanted to know what what
[1:53] was going on in the world you pick up a
[1:55] newspaper turn on radio or whatever and
[1:57] you get a news broadcast or a news
[1:58] report and that more or less tells you
[2:00] what's happening
[2:01] and you got it you know you had some
[2:04] division in in in the world being you
[2:06] know people having different opinions on
[2:07] what to do with what's going on you know
[2:10] different things happened people have a
[2:12] different opinion on how to approach it
[2:14] um
[2:16] but for the most part everyone more or
[2:18] less agreed that what you got in your
[2:19] newspaper was accurate right right like
[2:23] it was it was more or less the truth it
[2:25] was
[2:26] the same for everybody
[2:28] um and so it's a difference in
[2:30] in you know how we approach those facts
[2:33] but the facts are the same
[2:35] well this guy goes well you know that's
[2:36] differences of opinion are so 20th
[2:39] century here in the 21st century we have
[2:41] differences of facts
[2:42] right nobody can agree on what's even
[2:45] true anymore it nobody agrees that this
[2:47] is what happened you know you you you
[2:49] hear something you know was going on in
[2:52] the news you pick up a newspaper and
[2:54] depending on what newspaper you pick up
[2:56] the story is going to be very very
[2:57] different
[2:59] um depending on what news commentator
[3:01] you're listening to what the actual
[3:03] facts that matter are going to vary
[3:05] pretty wildly
[3:07] and
[3:09] you know this is it's a it's a sign that
[3:12] it creates chaos right I mean everybody
[3:13] nobody knows what's true anymore nobody
[3:15] knows how to approach anything anymore
[3:16] nobody has any sense of of what's
[3:19] concrete and nobody can can move forward
[3:21] and make any decisions
[3:23] because you don't know what's going on
[3:24] that everyone's just kind of blindly
[3:27] kind of shooting in the dark
[3:30] and it it it's it I think it's almost
[3:33] probably a sign of the age really
[3:34] because it extends so much farther
[3:36] Beyond outside of like news or politics
[3:40] um
[3:40] since 2015 the scientific world has been
[3:43] struggling with something
[3:45] they call it the replicability crisis or
[3:48] the replication crisis
[3:51] um so
[3:53] you know in science the way the
[3:56] scientific method was always supposed to
[3:57] function is that people would do an
[3:58] experiment all right you do an
[4:00] experiment get some results you write
[4:01] everything down and publish it
[4:03] and then the idea was that you had to be
[4:05] give very meticulous
[4:07] explanation of what you did and how it
[4:09] worked and what your results were so
[4:11] that some guy from across the world
[4:14] that's never met you has never been to
[4:16] where you are in his own laboratory
[4:17] could look at what you wrote down and
[4:20] repeat everything that you did step by
[4:21] step and get the same outcome
[4:23] right because if two people can do the
[4:26] same thing and get two different
[4:27] outcomes then someone didn't do
[4:29] something right right either what you're
[4:32] looking studying you have no idea what
[4:34] you're looking at or you didn't write
[4:37] something down right somebody lied
[4:39] somewhere right either the guy who did
[4:40] it initially didn't do it you know
[4:42] didn't actually report what he did or or
[4:44] Faked his data or the guy who did it the
[4:47] second time did something wrong
[4:48] regardless something's not right here if
[4:51] you can't repeat it every time
[4:53] if you don't get the same results every
[4:55] time
[4:57] and
[4:58] you know
[4:59] starting in you know when the scientific
[5:01] method and and scientism really kind of
[5:04] started kicking off and you started
[5:05] getting people to transition away from
[5:07] religion and more towards science as a
[5:09] as a their truth
[5:12] Discerning apparatus
[5:15] you really put science on a pedestal
[5:17] because you know you you get the
[5:18] scientific Community going oh well we
[5:19] don't need it we don't need religion
[5:21] right we have science to determine the
[5:22] truth we have this method you know
[5:24] religion is full of charlatans and fakes
[5:26] and con artists who will just tell you
[5:27] any old thing and and there's no way to
[5:29] verify anything and you know here in
[5:31] science we have we have the scientific
[5:33] method and we can we can you know
[5:35] replicate our results and all these
[5:36] sorts of things
[5:38] okay
[5:39] well
[5:42] now we have a crisis
[5:44] because science can't replicate its
[5:45] results
[5:46] in 2015 it kind of kicked off where a
[5:49] bunch of
[5:51] scientists started verifying a bunch of
[5:53] the results they said well wait a minute
[5:54] we've been publishing data publishing
[5:56] papers for like 50 60 years and no one's
[6:00] bothered to actually repeat the studies
[6:03] no one no one did it we just took it on
[6:05] on faith that the first time they did it
[6:07] was right
[6:09] and so they said all right well we're
[6:10] going to replicate they took a hundred
[6:12] of the biggest studies that they could
[6:13] find and and did replication studies on
[6:15] them couldn't replicate any of it
[6:18] and so they're all scratching their
[6:20] heads going okay folks we got a problem
[6:21] because we've been we've been doing
[6:24] Decades of research and Decades of
[6:26] conclusions off of papers that we can't
[6:30] we can't say with any confidence or
[6:32] accurate
[6:33] yeah right and because then because then
[6:35] what happens is these papers get
[6:36] published and then people do additional
[6:38] studies using those as the foundations
[6:41] and then you've got layers of falsehood
[6:44] stacked on top of each other
[6:46] well this so where's your where's your
[6:49] truth in science now nothing was
[6:51] replicatable
[6:53] and then it started it started in
[6:55] Psychology and then it it ended up in
[6:57] medicine even a lot of medical journals
[6:59] they're in big big research papers that
[7:03] they put out 50 60 years ago that have
[7:05] Decades of science stacked on top of it
[7:07] can't be replicated
[7:09] and this is medicine right and so for
[7:13] the replication crisis really kind of
[7:15] under the domains of of the social
[7:17] sciences and medicine I find that very
[7:20] interesting because that's the ones that
[7:22] deal with humans
[7:23] right it's the mankind trying to
[7:27] understand how his body and mind works
[7:29] and he can't determine anything true
[7:31] about either one of those things
[7:34] um
[7:35] you know
[7:36] and so we have this so now we we have
[7:39] the world in crisis because they're
[7:40] trying to figure out what's true
[7:42] and they can't because they can't
[7:45] they can't make any of the results stick
[7:48] and so
[7:49] you know that that's that's the world
[7:53] but
[7:58] in this time in this day
[8:01] the promise for the bride of Christ is
[8:03] that
[8:04] it would be a restoration
[8:06] right in this time when no one can
[8:08] determine what's true and the mechanisms
[8:13] that the world has used to determine
[8:15] truth can't be replicated nothing can be
[8:18] done over again yet the promise to the
[8:21] bride is that it would be done over
[8:23] again right that the whole idea of
[8:27] Malachi 4 was to restore the faith back
[8:30] to the original right that it would be
[8:33] it would be God proving that he was true
[8:37] by repeating his results to prove that
[8:40] he has something that they don't have
[8:42] right that there's truth there
[8:46] you know and so
[8:49] um
[8:55] I look at uh
[8:58] it's so
[9:01] it's so
[9:03] you know people people
[9:05] want to act like that there's there's no
[9:08] um
[9:08] you know these these things are for the
[9:10] for the past church right I mean I know
[9:13] here in the message we it's
[9:15] we've been hearing it for so many years
[9:16] it's almost become a cliche but
[9:19] truly the world does not believe in
[9:22] Supernatural things anymore you get some
[9:25] of it in the religious world but it's
[9:27] all very
[9:28] it's nothing like what we believe in
[9:31] it's really not you know you talk about
[9:33] how the Lord did something for you and
[9:35] people kind of raise their eyebrows at
[9:37] you you know like
[9:39] you know well I was I was healed of
[9:41] disease well brother you know that's um
[9:45] you know it's are you sure well I don't
[9:48] know it seemed pretty miraculous to me
[9:49] yeah you know
[9:51] um you know it's it's
[9:54] but what is it it's because we have a
[9:56] people who are taking God at his word
[9:57] and and it's showing that because
[10:01] ultimately
[10:03] you know I I that scripture that I read
[10:05] of where God swear by himself because
[10:08] there was nothing he couldn't lie right
[10:10] I kind of hit on this um last weekend
[10:12] but
[10:13] you know I've always kind of read that
[10:16] scripture and in my mind thought well
[10:18] God can't lie because
[10:21] he can't knowingly say something that's
[10:23] untrue right that's just not he's not
[10:25] able to do that
[10:27] um you know if if you know we had a red
[10:30] cup here he couldn't say that's a blue
[10:31] cup
[10:33] because it's false right that's always
[10:35] the way I kind of thought about it but
[10:38] I was reading that the other day and it
[10:40] kind of clicked in my head a little bit
[10:41] well obviously that is true I mean God
[10:43] can't lie in that sense but I think it's
[10:45] more than that because it's also the
[10:46] fact that God speaks with creative power
[10:49] God speaks and then worlds come into
[10:50] existence if God says if it's a blue cup
[10:53] and God says it's red maybe it just
[10:55] turns red
[10:56] right maybe maybe reality just conforms
[11:00] to what he said not and so when you know
[11:04] God can't lie because nothing he says
[11:07] can be made untrue
[11:09] right nothing he says can ever
[11:12] fall to the ground void it has to turn
[11:15] into something right
[11:18] you know we
[11:20] I I read that quote last week words
[11:22] brother Bram talking about how you know
[11:24] everything that we are the whole world
[11:25] the whole universe is ultimately the
[11:27] manifestation of God's spoken word it's
[11:29] his words made into concrete right the
[11:33] ground you're standing on is ultimately
[11:34] the word of God
[11:36] manifesting into into what it would be
[11:39] right
[11:41] and through this you know and so this is
[11:44] kind of the whole idea behind you know I
[11:47] know the men's prayer meeting has been
[11:49] going through spoken words The Original
[11:50] Seed
[11:53] and you know if you early on in that
[11:55] sermon brother Branham talks about how
[11:56] he you know he's like you know this is
[11:58] going to be
[11:59] this is going to be an explanation of
[12:01] why I believe all the things that I've
[12:03] preached right it's like I've preached a
[12:04] lot of things over the years that a lot
[12:06] of people don't understand but this
[12:07] sermon is going to be the explanation of
[12:10] all of that everything that brother
[12:12] Branham taught could be wrapped up in
[12:14] that sermon
[12:15] right or it's the it's the foundation
[12:17] for everything and the whole Foundation
[12:19] of all of it is that when God speaks it
[12:23] it's a seed there's something there's
[12:25] there's life and and and creative power
[12:29] in that word of God and when he speaks
[12:31] in the unadulterated word comes in
[12:33] contact with you it's going to manifest
[12:36] into something right it will produce
[12:38] something his words have to be made
[12:41] manifest that's why you have to have
[12:45] a a perfect word that's why you can't
[12:49] have a manipulated word
[12:53] um and here here's a a quote from the
[12:56] spoken words The Original Seed I was
[12:58] listening to it again this morning I've
[12:59] listened to it many times and it's
[13:02] fan
[13:03] it gets better almost every time
[13:05] um but he he he says this he says his
[13:09] words are the seeds of life and creation
[13:11] all of everything we are and see is the
[13:14] progress of God speaking he spoke and
[13:16] the universe became
[13:17] even though it took
[13:19] um
[13:20] a thousand years to come to pass oh
[13:22] sorry that was just what I was writing
[13:23] in my notes that's not what brother
[13:25] Brandon said I I've missed my
[13:27] delineation
[13:29] um
[13:30] this is this is where it starts this is
[13:31] that's the reason you can hybrid a
[13:33] donkey and a horse but it won't last
[13:34] it's death but the original has got life
[13:37] it comes back again
[13:40] I hope you can see it now the original
[13:42] has the life so that's the reason
[13:46] um I think that Cults and denominations
[13:48] and organizations die history proves
[13:52] um they're everyone dead they never did
[13:54] rise no more they never will they can't
[13:57] breed themselves back got nothing to
[13:59] breed with they're sterile that's why
[14:01] Eve's children dies
[14:04] so here's
[14:06] ultimately you know when God's spoken
[14:08] word that Original Seed right the
[14:11] original seed that that's that went and
[14:14] blossomed into the universe right
[14:19] that seed has to be perfect and the only
[14:22] the the unadulterated unhybrided
[14:25] word of God will come about with new
[14:28] life right use the illustration of the
[14:30] of the mule and the or the mule right
[14:32] you can breed a donkey and a horse
[14:33] together and you get a mule it's got
[14:35] some life in it right you can mule work
[14:39] hard as any animal you want to think of
[14:41] but
[14:42] it'll never reproduce whatever life it
[14:45] has is hybrid it can't make another mule
[14:48] right
[14:50] you know you can we
[14:52] um
[14:53] there's another crisis they had in the
[14:55] in I believe it was the 90s this
[14:56] happened after generations of
[14:58] genetically modifying corn and hydrating
[15:00] corn they eventually went to plant their
[15:02] corn and the corn didn't grow
[15:04] it came up with deformed mangled on
[15:08] it's nothing they just didn't it didn't
[15:10] produce anything that was corn it was
[15:12] just this pathetic
[15:14] deformity of a plant well why because
[15:17] after generations of hybriding
[15:19] eventually they got to something that
[15:21] wouldn't produce life anymore
[15:23] right at some point
[15:26] Humanity
[15:28] has taken the original Church we've the
[15:30] the the the
[15:32] Through the Ages people have taken the
[15:34] original doctrine of the church the
[15:37] original life that was in the church and
[15:40] manipulated it and conformed it to be
[15:42] something more palatable to what humans
[15:44] wanted right like with the corn
[15:47] original corn when the when the
[15:50] Europeans got to the North America you
[15:51] know the natives had maize
[15:53] which was you know let's
[15:56] corn kind of but if you ever try to eat
[15:58] an ear of maize it ain't nothing like
[16:00] what you think of as corn right it's
[16:02] hard it's unpleasant to eat it doesn't
[16:05] taste great but
[16:08] you know it takes a lot of work to get
[16:09] it to something that is really edible
[16:12] well
[16:15] it's a far cry from an ear of sweet corn
[16:17] that you can get at the grocery store
[16:18] today why it's because they've
[16:19] manipulated it they've grown it because
[16:21] man looked at something that was you
[16:23] know more or less the the creation of of
[16:26] God right this plant and said well this
[16:30] is not
[16:31] to our sensibilities right we want it to
[16:35] be sweeter and softer and nicer and
[16:37] produce more and it's going to be bigger
[16:39] and better and all these things that we
[16:41] want out of it
[16:43] and so after generations of manipulation
[16:45] they got sweet corn
[16:47] eventually they got sweet corn That
[16:48] Couldn't reproduce itself
[16:50] well
[16:52] likewise people have taken the word of
[16:54] God and yeah it's it's got a lot of
[16:56] nutrients and it and it's good for you
[16:58] but it doesn't taste too great sometimes
[16:59] right it's not it's not
[17:02] palatable to our sensibilities it
[17:04] doesn't feel nice to have the hide
[17:07] ripped off you when when you're looking
[17:09] at the mirror of God's word and
[17:10] recognizing that you're that you're
[17:12] wrong really wrong
[17:14] it's not pleasant
[17:16] But ultimately it's the only way you're
[17:20] going to reproduce the life because if
[17:21] you go down this other path and take
[17:22] some
[17:24] something that isn't really there
[17:26] because it fits your sensibilities and
[17:28] it fits what you like well that'll be
[17:31] fine for a while but eventually it won't
[17:33] reproduce you won't have there won't be
[17:37] life right you know the original word
[17:40] [Music]
[17:41] will keep reproducing life eternally you
[17:44] can just keep putting it in the ground
[17:45] and it'll keep coming up and you keep
[17:46] replanting and it'll keep coming up and
[17:47] it'll go over and over and over and over
[17:49] as many years as God allows to be on the
[17:51] earth that seed will keep reproducing
[17:53] but
[17:55] what you know this man-made stuff it
[17:57] won't do that and so your you know on
[18:01] that day on the Resurrection Day if you
[18:03] don't have a genuine Real Deal seed from
[18:08] the original you won't come up in the
[18:10] resurrection
[18:11] right it just won't it won't produce
[18:13] life because it can't
[18:16] because ultimately that's what that's
[18:20] going back to where we started right
[18:22] this is the this is the promise that God
[18:24] gave to the bride at the end was that it
[18:26] would be a restoration of the original
[18:28] right it's the promise that what we have
[18:31] now is the original and so it can it can
[18:34] come up in the resurrection it has life
[18:36] in it
[18:38] and
[18:41] it's God proving that the life that's in
[18:43] it is the truth it's the proving that
[18:46] it's that it is there's something true
[18:48] and genuine there because otherwise it
[18:51] wouldn't come up it wouldn't reproduce
[18:53] it couldn't reproduce in this day that's
[18:55] why you know that all of these other
[18:56] systems that are out there
[18:58] everything else that that's out there
[19:01] ultimately fails and falls apart and
[19:03] ends up wildly deviated from where it
[19:06] started because there wasn't there was
[19:09] something ungenuine about it
[19:11] in the first place
[19:13] right
[19:14] that's why you see when when people
[19:17] you know we've talked about this before
[19:18] you know people who've been in the
[19:20] messenger Christians for 50 60 you know
[19:23] maybe not 50 years but the point is a
[19:24] long time 20 30 40 years maybe
[19:27] and then boom one day they're just not
[19:29] anymore
[19:30] and have a meltdown
[19:32] well why is because there was something
[19:34] not genuine to begin with there was
[19:36] something wrong from the start and they
[19:39] might have been able to replicate they
[19:41] might have been able to replant their
[19:43] seed for 50 years but eventually it came
[19:45] up deformed their life didn't keep going
[19:48] right whatever whatever seed they had
[19:51] was was not the Original Seed
[19:57] um
[20:00] and so that's that's kind of where I
[20:03] feel like you know we are today in at
[20:05] this in this day and hour here we are as
[20:08] the bride of Christ we're having to
[20:09] recognize that where we are is is the
[20:11] original is is the life that was in
[20:14] Christ right where he could walk out on
[20:18] and do about go about his father's
[20:20] business and have the faith and the
[20:22] understanding that no matter what stood
[20:23] in front of him
[20:24] he could step out on on where he knew on
[20:27] who he knew that he was and can move
[20:30] forward
[20:31] and no nothing was going to come between
[20:34] him and what he was sent to Earth to do
[20:37] right nothing you know he could he could
[20:40] you know there's throughout the the
[20:42] scripture you know there's a lot of
[20:44] instances where it seemed like the Life
[20:46] of Christ was going to be cut very short
[20:48] right
[20:51] it they didn't just try to crucify him
[20:54] well I'll make an example here you know
[20:57] with Judas brother Brown talks about how
[20:58] Judas thought that he could get the
[21:01] money for in and betray Jesus but
[21:03] because Jesus had gotten out of it so
[21:05] many times before there had been many
[21:06] times when the Pharisees tried to Corner
[21:08] him and kill him right it's one they
[21:10] weren't just the first time it wasn't
[21:11] like one day they decided to do it no
[21:13] they've been doing this for years
[21:15] well
[21:17] you know
[21:19] every time they've done it before it
[21:20] just wasn't the right time so Jesus
[21:23] could go and and do things and know that
[21:26] nothing would happen because he had a
[21:28] promise that there was a certain way it
[21:30] was going to go
[21:32] right
[21:34] and it might no matter how how uh
[21:37] difficult things might be no matter how
[21:42] um dark things might be for us no matter
[21:44] how unclear things are
[21:47] um I you know I have a I wish I had it
[21:50] now I'd always always have things that
[21:52] happen to me could never never have the
[21:53] quote that I wanted when I when I'm up
[21:55] here
[21:56] um when it comes to me but you know
[21:58] there's a quote where brother Brands
[21:59] talking about how you know people it was
[22:02] talking about um responsibility how he
[22:03] has a responsibility to handle his gifts
[22:05] and things like that and he says you
[22:07] know people think of me he says you know
[22:10] you'll say to me well brother Brandon it
[22:11] must be so easy to be you because you
[22:14] know God just shows you everything in a
[22:15] vision and you just go about you know
[22:17] what you see in the vision he's like no
[22:19] I have to pray and struggle and and and
[22:21] and and and and
[22:22] scrape about for the will of God
[22:25] probably harder than you do
[22:27] it's like it's not like God just showed
[22:29] up and and showed him everything in a
[22:31] vision and then you know every single
[22:32] day his whole day's planned out because
[22:34] God laid his schedule out for him you
[22:36] know no it's not how it was at all
[22:38] brother Branham was was struggling and
[22:41] he's like and not only that he's like
[22:42] I have to struggle for for guidance
[22:45] probably stronger than you do and the
[22:47] weight of the the responsibility the the
[22:49] ramifications of me getting wrong is way
[22:52] worse than you guys
[22:54] right
[22:55] so
[22:57] ultimately you know and and so there's
[23:00] going to be times
[23:02] where it's not going to seem clear right
[23:05] you can you can absolutely be in the
[23:07] will of the Lord and have no idea
[23:09] right it's not it's not super clear it's
[23:12] gonna be super dark it's gonna be
[23:13] discouraging and fearful
[23:16] but that's what we take hold of the
[23:19] promise and say well yeah but the word
[23:22] says that it's gonna be like it was then
[23:25] the word even though maybe in and of
[23:27] myself I don't feel like I am
[23:31] you know the the
[23:33] literal Life of Christ manifested again
[23:36] well the word says that you are and so
[23:38] even if it doesn't look that way
[23:39] necessarily to your eyes you have to
[23:42] keep moving forward you can never let go
[23:44] of that it's
[23:46] it's
[23:48] always going to be
[23:51] um
[23:52] a distraction and it's
[23:55] you always have to have confidence that
[23:57] Eve because God spoke it right God spoke
[23:59] it and even if it doesn't look like it
[24:02] now even if you can't necessarily see it
[24:05] with your eyes
[24:07] we recognize that because God spoke it
[24:09] and no matter how dark we get right if
[24:11] the cup is blue when God speaks it turns
[24:13] red well if God says you're perfect and
[24:15] you can look at yourself and say well
[24:16] I'm unperfect well
[24:20] okay give it a minute right you know God
[24:22] spoke you know God spoke and said let
[24:25] there be light and it took a thousand
[24:27] years for that to manifest
[24:29] right we'll take a promise into our life
[24:31] and if it's not done in 35 seconds
[24:36] all right well that must not have been
[24:38] for me wow come on right it's a seed
[24:41] seeds take time to grow right you got to
[24:44] put it you got to sink it the promise
[24:45] into your heart you got to take that
[24:46] that word that he spoke you know of
[24:48] healing of salvation of of being a new
[24:51] creation of having your desires changed
[24:53] having these things take that promise
[24:55] and sink it into your heart and when
[24:56] tomorrow morning it's not sprouted you
[24:58] don't go ah man let me dig it up and
[24:59] make sure it's okay
[25:01] right no you'll never get anything that
[25:03] way you just leave it there and if you
[25:05] don't see it for a while okay keep
[25:07] pouring the water of the word on it keep
[25:09] feeding on the word keep reading and
[25:11] praying eventually it's going to come up
[25:13] right eventually eventually the life
[25:15] that's in it is gonna is gonna become
[25:18] prove itself true
[25:20] yeah so I guess that's
[25:22] we're out of time so we'll stand and
[25:24] have a word of Prayer
[25:30] father Lord
[25:32] thank you for this opportunity to
[25:34] maybe give some encouragement to your
[25:36] people Lord I trust that my words would
[25:39] have been
[25:41] something that the people will be able
[25:42] to take hold of and give them a
[25:45] a boost father to keep fighting and keep
[25:47] swinging their sort of Faith driving
[25:49] back the powers of the enemy Lord
